0,Hermes,Planet Express delivery company roll call! Captain Turanga Leela!
1,Leela,Here!
2,Hermes,"Delivery boy, first class, Philip J. Fry!"
3,Fry,Here!
4,Hermes,"Assistant Manager of Sales, Bender Bending Rodriguez!"
5,Bender,"Here!  Cerveza, por favor."
6,Hermes,"Long-term intern, Amy Wong."
7,Amy,Here!
8,Hermes,"Company physician, Dr. John A. Zoidberg."
9,Zoidberg,Huh? I thought it was mine!
10,Hermes,"Bureaucrat Grade 34, Hermes Conrad."
11,Hermes,"Is who I am. And now I am proud to present the owner and founder of Planet Express, Professor Hubert J. Farnsworth!"
12,Farnsworth,You're all fired.
13,Hermes,Sweet bongo of the Congo!
14,Farnsworth,"In fact, you were fired two years ago! That's when we were shut down by the delivery network."
15,Farnsworth,"Yes, I'm afraid the brainless drones who run the network canceled our license."
16,Fry,We were canceled?
17,Farnsworth,"Oh, it's terrible. Just terrible. Well, clear out your desks and move along. Chop-chop."
18,Farnsworth,Yes? I see.
19,Farnsworth,"Good news, everyone! Those asinine morons who canceled us were themselves fired for incompetence."
20,Staff,Woohoo!
21,Zoidberg,Yahoo!
22,Farnsworth,"And not just fired, but beaten up, too. And pretty badly."
23,Staff,Woo!
24,Farnsworth,"In fact, most of them died from their injuries."
25,Staff,Woo?
26,Farnsworth,And then they were ground up into a fine pink powder.
27,Fry,Why?
28,Farnsworth,"Oh, it's got a million and one uses."
29,Farnsworth,"Ahhh, that soothes the fire."
30,Leela,So what does this mean for us and our many fans?
31,Farnsworth,It means we're back on the air!
32,Farnsworth,"Yes, flying on the air in our mighty spaceship!"
33,Staff,Woooohoooo!
34,Zoidberg,Yayyy!
35,Bender,"We're back, baby!"
36,All,"Party! Go, go, go!"
37,Cubert,"Lower, lawn mower!"
38,Hermes,"What's the matter, robot? You got a rod up your spine?"
39,Bender,"Yes, I do. That's how I'm built."
40,All,Hooray.
41,Fry,Way to bend it!
42,Bender,"You're the greatest, Bender!"
43,Hermes,"In Jamaica, we got 10-story office buildings lower than that."
44,Leela,"Let's see you beat it, Rastaman."
45,Staff,Ooooohh...
46,Hermes,Let's make it interesting. Fetch down one of them sabers.
47,Bender,"Oh, flexible. That would go good up my spine."
48,Hermes,Lower.
49,Bender,The fat guy wins!
50,Fry,"Go, Hermes!"
51,Hermes,That's why they call me 11-inch Conrad.
52,Scruffy,"Oh, no."
53,Featuring,Phillip J. Fry
54,Fry,"Can you save Hermes, Dr. Goodensexy?"
55,Dr. Cahill,"I told you, my name is Dr. Cahill."
56,Hermes,Figures I'd get mangled while the blonde bimbo's on duty.
57,Dr. Cahill,"I'm a doctor, sir. The mere fact that I'm blonde and have a breathy voice, full sensual lips, and a steaming hot body doesn't make me a bimbo."
58,Zoidberg,Tell me about it.
59,Hermes,"I think we've all learned a thing or two about sexual stereotypes. While my head's slowly dying 'cause I'm not in a jar yet, you bimbo!"
60,Dr. Cahill,"Oh, right. Ditzy-witzy! Lars, got another jar job!"
61,Lars,"Oh, sorry, Doctor. I was disinfecting Courtney Love... Oh, hello."
62,Leela,What are you looking at? Is it the eye?
63,Lars,"Guilty as charged. It's a nice looking eye, and there's plenty of it."
64,Leela,Oh. Do I know you?
65,Lars,Apparently not. Hi. I'm Lars.
66,Leela,Oh. I'm Leela. Nice to meet you.
67,Lars,Nice to be met.
68,Hermes,"Pick up ladies on your own time, you shiny-headed goat!"
69,Lars,"Sir, you're just a little enraged 'cause you're dying. Up and away!"
70,Amy,Lars is so flirting with you.
71,Leela,He is so not. He's just being polite.
72,Fry,"Who does he think he is, being polite to you? You want me to beat him up?"
73,Leela,No. Stop being so immature.
74,Fry,I'll show her who's immature.
75,Fry,"""Charles de Gaulle""? Never heard of you."
76,Charles de Gualle's Head,I freed France from the Nazis and...
77,Fry,"Hey, Leela. I'm some French guy."
78,Bender,"Rock that Frenchman, baby!"
79,LaBarbara,"Oh, my poor little love pirate of the Caribbean!"
80,Hermes,"There, there, wife. Everything will be all--"
81,LaBarbara,"Okay, look, Hermes, we got to think of the boy. He needs a daddy."
82,Hermes,He has a daddy!
83,LaBarbara,"No, he got two half-daddies. Will his body be all right?"
84,Dr. Cahill,"Yes, but it may take a few days."
85,LaBarbara,"No, not soon enough. Come, Dwight, let's find you a handsome new father."
86,Hermes,"LaBarbara, no!"
87,Bender,"It's okay, Hermes. We're all here for you."
88,Farnsworth,"Good news, everyone! We've got a delivery to the nude beach planet."
89,Staff,Woohoo!
90,Bender,"So long, jerk."
91,Leela,It feels great to be back at the wheel after two long years.
92,Fry,That's not the wheel.
93,Leela,It's nice out.
94,Fry,"""You must be at least this naked""? How much nakeder could you be?"
95,Zoidberg,Watch and learn.
96,Bender,"You know, it's funny."
97,Fry,What?
98,Bender,Your wiener!
99,Farnsworth,"Well, I'm going in the water to prune up a bit before I strut. Who's with me?"
100,Amy,I'm in!
101,Leela,I'm in.
102,Bender,"Yeah, I'll go."
103,Fry,You guys go ahead. I gotta find the bartender and deliver this box of barstool softener.
104,Bartender,Why are you talking to my penis?
105,Fry,"Oh, sorry. Sign here."
106,Bartender,Mind if I use your pen?
107,Fry,"Well, that's not a..."
108,Fry,And initial here.
109,Fry,Thank you for using Planet Express.
110,Leela,"Hey, Fry, I didn't know you had a tattoo of Bender on your ass."
111,Fry,Me neither.
112,Bender,You got a tattoo of me? Neat. It's like looking in a smelly mirror.
113,Farnsworth,So he's got a little ink. Big whoop.
114,Bender,"Sweet photons. I don't know if you're waves or particles, but you go down smooth."
115,Nudar,"Sir, would you care to sign our petition?"
116,Bender,"I support and oppose many things, but not strongly enough to pick up a pen."
117,Nudar,That's just what the guys who oppose the things you support want you to do.
118,Bender,Really? Down with those guys!
119,Fleb,And we'll need your e-mail address.
120,Bender,"Hmm, they say you shouldn't give out your e-mail address."
121,Nudar,Right. That's just what those same guys say.
122,Bender,Them again?
123,Leela,I don't quite understand what this petition's about.
124,Schlump,"Um,... animals?"
125,Leela,Aw.
126,Schlump,And your e-mail address.
127,Leela,"You won't send me any spam, will you?"
128,Nudar,"Oh, no, no, no, no. Asterisk."
129,Leela's Wrist Thingy,You've got spam.
130,Leela,"Spam, spam, junk. The very last pygmy rhino is going extinct? Unless it gets my credit card number?"
131,Amy,"Spam. Spam. ""Hi. How are you?"" Oh, that must be from Kiffy."
132,Amy's computer,"Hi, how are you? Low, low prices on erectile dysfunction remedies, sleeping pills, old-person drugs, and antidepressants."
133,Amy,"Antidepressants? Well, I certainly don't want to get depressed."
134,Amy's computer,Please enter credit card number.
135,Amy,Is cash okay?
136,Bender,"Porn. Porn. Free porn. Get rich watching porn? I find that rather hard to believe.  Hmmm, scientists at West Johnson Pornoversity need test subjects to rate top quality roborotica. Ooh, top-quality."
137,Bender,"Warning, perform virus scan? Pffft, I'm waiting for porn over here."
138,Bender,"Oh, yeah, come on, baby."
139,Bender,Roborotic....
140,Zoidberg,"Friends, friends! His Majesty Prince Adisaraki O. Zoidberg of Nigeria died."
141,Amy,That's so sad. When will those antidepressants get here?
142,Zoidberg,"Wait, there's more. According to this e-mail, I, Zoidberg, am his next of kin. Once I wire some good-faith money to an overseas bank account, I'll inherit his kingdom, his canoe, and his plump young wife."
143,Hermes,You dumb stumps. Don't you realize you're being scammed?
144,Zoidberg,"That is low, Hermes. Just because you don't have a body, you don't want anyone else to be prince of Nigeria. Well, try and stop me from wiring that money."
145,Farnsworth,"What's going on here? According to my illegal key logging software, you've all been giving out personal information over the Internet. If Hermes were here, he'd fire you all."
146,Hermes,I am here!
147,Farnsworth,"Quiet, you. In his absence, I'm calling a mandatory company security seminar. To the mandatorium!"
148,Farnsworth,"Now, it's not hard to spot a phony Internet come-on. ""Get rich quick x7 q""? Phony. ""Lose weight with space parasites""? Phony. What's this? I've won the Spanish National Lottery?"
149,Leela,"No, it's a scam!"
150,Farnsworth,"Yes, yes, a scam. My goodness, I'm rich! And to think I didn't even know I had a ticket. I just need to wire some collateral to collect the winnings."
151,Hermes,"Professor, stop! You're giving away personal information!"
152,Farnsworth,I can afford to give away anything I want. I've won the Spanish National Lottery.
153,Amy,"No, don't!"
154,Leela,It's a scam!
155,Hermes,Why won't anybody listen to me?!?
156,Farnsworth,And my mother's maiden name and her bank account numbers and ... There! I'm rich. Rich. Rich!
157,Farnsworth,"That must be my $400 now. Hello. Or should I say, '""Buenos dias""?"
158,Nudar,Hi. We own your company now.
159,Farnsworth,Hwhaa?
160,Bender,"I'll deal with these guys. Welcome, boss."
161,Amy,"Hey, what the hell?"
162,Nudar,Guess I was wrong. There was a robot stupid enough to download the obedience virus.
163,Bender,"I sure was. Make a hole, chumps.  Presenting our new masters!"
164,Bender,"Where shall I put these auto-dialers, kind master?"
165,Nudar,Between the password crank and the spamjaculator. Come on! We've got a whole planet to scam. And bring me some more Gummi Fungus!
166,Leela,We don't have to stand here and take abuse from a gross nerd.
167,Amy,Yeah!
168,Fry,Yeah!
169,Zoidberg,Yeah!
170,Leela,Hi-yah!
171,Nudar,"Now get back to work, you turkeys! Planet Express is still in business. We've got crap loads of quote-unquote merchandise to deliver."
172,Fleb,"Ship them out, Your Highness."
173,Zoidberg,"Finally, some respect."
174,Amy,I feel a little better.
175,Bender,"Those marvelous scammers sure scammed us, huh?"
176,Leela,How can you just sit there kissing the aliens' butt flaps? Don't you realize you are totally under their control?
177,Bender,"Of course I realize it. Does that mean I can't enjoy it? Hee hee hee hee. Boy, were we suckers."
178,Lars,"Greetings, earthlings."
179,Fry,"Oh, hooray. It's handsome Lars and his fabulous jars."
180,Lars,"Hello, everyone who isn't Leela. And a special hello to everyone else."
181,Hermes,Shut your lockers and get to class. How's my body doing?
182,Lars,"Oh, I'm afraid it's behind schedule. The museum got tricked into giving all its funding to something called the Scamming Sciences Institute."
183,Bender,It's a fake place.
184,Hermes,"Cut to the chase, baldy. When do I get my me back?"
185,Lars,"Well, it could be months, or even years."
186,Hermes,No! That body's the cornerstone of my marriage. What's LaBarbara going to do?
187,Amy,Spluh! She's going to go back to her first husband.
188,Zoidberg,Barbados Slim? I love that guy.
189,Hermes,Everybody loves Slim.
190,Hermes,He's the only man to ever win Olympic gold medals in both limbo and sex.
191,Lars,"Well, maybe I should get going."
192,Fry,"Yes, I'll show you out."
193,Amy,"No, Leela will show him out."
194,Leela,"No, Leela will show you out. Me. Leela."
195,Lars,"So your friend, Fry, seems nice. Are you and he dati--?"
196,Leela,Nope.
197,Lars,"Good, because I was maybe thinking of asking you out for dinner."
198,Leela,"Ohhhh. I'll start maybe thinking about saying ""Sure, when?"""
199,Lars,Let me maybe give it some thought.
200,Lars,Tomorrow at 8
201,Leela,Okay.
202,Fry,It's not fair. I've loved Leela since the day I came to the future. Did I show you the macaroni valentine I made for her?
203,Amy,Yes.
204,Fry,Look at it again.
205,Fry,"I know she thinks I'm immature, but someday I won't be. And deep down in my heart, I know we'll end up together. It's all there in the macaroni."
206,Leela,Lars asked me out!
207,Bender,"What are you doing, wonderful masters?"
208,Fleb,Sprunjing for information.
209,Nudar,"Oh! There's something here. I can sprunje it. Robot, tear it open!"
210,Bender,"Goody, goody, goody, goody!"
211,Zoidberg,What's that thing on your neck?
212,Nudar,"Checking out my sprunjer, huh?"
213,Zoidberg,I guess. What does it do?
214,Nudar,It's a special sense organ our species possesses. It engorges in the presence of...  Information.
215,Zoidberg,Lucky you. All I have is a gland that gives off foul odors when I'm bored.
216,Bender,"Hey, look, a safe!"
217,Farnsworth,That's my safe. I call keep-offsies.
218,Nudar,No callsies! Open it!
219,Schlump,"It's a gold mine. Tax forms, Social Security cards. Combination hair, blood and stool samples!"
220,Fry,I don't get it. How can you say Lars is more mature than me?
221,Leela,"Well, for one thing, his checkbook doesn't have the Hulk on it."
222,Nudar,Who are you?
223,Fry,Philip J. Fry.
224,Schlump,"Social Security Number 03280810? Stool type, P-negative?"
225,Fry,That's right.
226,Nudar,I've never detected so much information before. I think it may be a Level 87 code.
227,Fleb,"Level 87? Can it be? I thought it was only a legend, but the sprunjer never lies."
228,Nudar,It's in his pants!
229,Fry,What the hell are you talking about?
230,Nudar,"Faster, faster!"
231,Farnsworth,I'm sciencing as fast as I can.
232,Bender,"What do you say, folks? Hot or not?"
233,Nudar,I'm not seeing any information. Do more things!
234,Nudar,"You, boogerbot, read the code or I'll shoot this guy."
235,Bender,Who the hell is he?
236,Scruffy,"I'm Scruffy, the janitor."
237,Bender,"Hang on, Scruffy! Zero, zero, one, one, zero, zero, zero, one, zero, zero, one, zero, zero, one, one, one, one, zero, one, zero, zero, zero, zero, one, one, zero, one, one, zero, one, one, one, zero, zero, one, one."
238,"""God""",Huh?
239,Fleb,A time sphere.
240,Nudar,"Naked brothers, we have sprunjed upon the universal machine language time code. The key to time travel!"
241,Leela,What's the secret of time travel doing on Fry's ass?
242,Fry,It was bound to be somewhere.
243,Nudar,And we can steal them! We just go to the past and take stuff with our superior weapons!
244,Nibbler,"Stop, you fools!"
245,Amy,What's going on?
246,Farnsworth,What is happening?
247,Leela,"Nibbler, you... You can talk?"
248,Nibbler,"I can do more than talk. I can pontificate. You must not use the code of codes. With each and every use, you risk tearing the universe asunder."
249,Amy,"Oh, he's so adorable."
250,Fleb,The poodle-monkey may be right. The legend warns that the code is powerful and dangerous.
251,Nudar,"My God. We'd better use it only three or four times. Six, max."
252,Nibbler,But even a single use could shatter the universe!
253,Nudar,Got it. Two or three times.
254,Nibbler,"I see I have no choice. Nibblonians, attack!"
255,???,Hey! That tickles.
256,Schlump,And the pitch!
257,Nibblonian,"Mayday, mayday!"
258,Aliens,Hey! Hey! Hey!
259,Nibblonian,Scamper!
260,Zoidberg,Aawww...
261,Nibbler,"Alas, our kitten-class attack ships were no match for their mighty chairs. The universe is doomed. Doomed!"
262,Fry,Can I pull up my pants now?
263,Nibbler,Dooooooomed!
264,Nudar,Stand back you wing wangs. I'm gonna try out this timesphere with a quick test drive to yesterday.
265,Farnsworth,Bushwah. You can't go mucking about in the past without creating paradoxes.
266,Nibbler,"I'm afraid he can. It's a paradox correcting time code. It all works perfectly. Except when it rips open the universe. Don't do it, I beg you ..."
267,Nudar,"Yesterday please, and make it snappy."
268,Crew,wha???
269,Nudar,Hello.
270,Nudar-2,Howdy.
271,Bender,Hey! What the ...?
272,Zoidberg,"There was one, but now there's two."
273,Nudar,"Nothing gets past you eagle eye. I went back to last night and met the me of that time for a drink. One thing led to another and we ended up at my place, or should I say our place."
274,Leela,Blech.
275,Nudar,"Oh come on, ya bunch of prudes!"
276,Farnsworth,"This isn't merely revolting, it's impossible to boot. I know a paradox when I see one."
277,Farnsworth,Whaaa?
278,Farnsworth,"Ahh, paradox resolved. Someone get a mop."
279,Dwight,"You're looking well, pops."
280,Hermes,"How can you look me in the eye 'n eye and say that? I'm nothin' but a brain. A useless, filthy brain."
281,Barbados Slim,You forgot lice infested.
282,Hermes,"I didn't forget it, I just chose not to ....  Barbados Slim! What are you doin' here? IS there somethin' goin' on between you two?"
283,LaBarbara,"Oh no no no no, we jus' ah happened to run into each other shortly after your accident."
284,Slim,And every night since then.
285,LaBarbara,You're so crazy.
286,Hermes,"Woman! No! Ohh, who am I kiddin'? Without my body, I'm a nobody."
287,LaBarbara,I'm sorry Hermes. But look at Barbados. You can't argue with those luscious pecks.
288,Hermes,No I can't. But I can ask him to stop wiggling them in my face.
289,Slim,I'm not wiggling them. They do that by themselves.
290,Nudar,I think I'll go back in time and steal the Liberty Bell before it cracked. Or is the crack the valuable part?
291,Farnsworth,"I don't know, you naked crook!"
292,Fleb,"We have a problem Nudar. It's a one way time code. It can take us to the past, but it can't bring us back to the present."
293,Bender,"Oh oh oh oh oh oh! Masters, if I might, let me do the stealing. I'll go to the past and snatch everything I can get my greasy mitts on. Then, as a robot, I could just wait it out for a few centuries in the limestone cavern beneath this building. Oh, it'll be ever so much fun."
294,Nudar,"Hey, that's perfect. We sit back and let dum dum here do the stealing."
295,Bender,Dum dum away. Zero zero one one ....
296,Leela,The Mona Lisa!
297,Bender,"Sorry, it's not quite finished."
298,Bender,Let's just say he may not make it to The Last Supper. Hahahahahaha.
299,Farnsworth,Preposterous twaddlecock! Time travel is impossible.
300,Fry,"But Professor, you time traveled yourself, remember, when we went back to Roswell?"
301,Farnsworth,"That proves nothing. And furthermore, you'd think I'd remember a thing like that. Plus, who are you anyway?"
302,Bender,"Man, this is fun on a bun. Here I go again."
303,Nibbler,Oh no you don't.
304,Bender,"Scarab, four arm, bird, bird, bird!"
305,Bender,"Boo! Hahahaha. Naw, it's just me, Bender."
306,Farnsworth,"I must tell you Hedonismbot, I hate to sell my doomsday devices to a private collector. But with my business stolen I have to make ends meet. You will be careful?"
307,Hedonismbot,"I shan't touch them till I've had Jambi lock the absinthe and ether away. Ohhhh, what does this one do?"
308,Farnsworth,"Uh, that one kills everything everywhere."
309,Hedonismbot,How delightful. And this one?
310,Farnsworth,Sir! The sphereoboom is not for sale.
311,Farnsworth,It's my sentimental favorite.
312,Hedonismbot,"No need to explain. I too have known unconventional love. Perhaps you and I, and Jambi, could get together and compare notes sometime, eh?"
313,MC,... resulting in peace between east and west coat rappers ...
314,MC,Good god!
315,Bender,"I accept this Nobel peace prize not just for myself, but for crime robots everywhere. Skål!"
316,Bender,"Not so neutral now, are you Sweden?"
317,Leela,Be honest with me. Does my eye look monstery? I don't want to look monstery for my date with Lars.
318,Hermes,"At least a monster has a body. What I wouldn't give for Wolfman's torso, or any of the groovy ghoulies."
319,Leela,"Ohh, I think I'll wear that slutty dress I've been saving for Easter."
320,Fry,I'd like to punch Lars right in his ruggedly good looking face!
321,Nudar,"Like all rich people, we're gonna need weapons to shoot poor people."
322,Schlump,In self defense?
323,Nudar,"Yes, that too. Bender, go steal the doomsday device chained to the professor's wrist."
324,Bender,"Never! Ha ha, I'm kidding. You guys know I have to do whatever you say."
325,Nudar,"Here, swap this for the real one."
326,Bender,Ahhh! The old switcheroo.
327,Nudar,"Yes, but don't wake him. You'll need jeweler's tools and foot cup silencers."
328,Bender,"Hey! I don't tell you how to tell me what to do, so don't tell me how to do what you tell me to do. Bender knows when to use finesse."
329,Bender,Here ya go.
330,Nudar,"Put it in the safe, clanky."
331,Zoidberg,Owww!
332,Bender,Wheeeeeeee.
333,Zoidberg,It's the damdest thing ...
334,Zoidberg,... there I was in the dumpster enjoying a moldy fudgesicle when suddenly your hand flies over and slaps me in the tokhes.
335,Farnsworth,"Yes, well, these things happen. Fortunately the sphereoboom is still safe."
336,Farnsworth,Scammed? Me!? Sweetheart?!? Ohh!
337,Hermes,"You do a nice hand job, Zoidberg. Tell me, If I could find an undamaged body, could you recapitate me?"
338,Zoidberg,"Hermes, I'm a surgeon. When I see two body parts I sew them together and see what happens."
339,Hermes,Hmmm.
340,Hermes,All I'm askin' is for you to go back in time to when I still had my body and bring it back for me.
341,Bender,What do I do with your old head?
342,Hermes,I don't care in the slightest.
343,Bender,Can do!
344,Hermes,"Come on, mon!"
345,Zoidberg,"Hermes, please. You can't hurry a delicate operation like this."
346,Hermes,Ohh! ... Ug! ... Argh! ... Ahhhhhh.  What are those?
347,Hermes,You incompetent crab!
348,Zoidberg,"I thought you were happy, your tail is wagging."
349,Hermes,Grrrrrr....
350,Farnsworth,"I believe this paradoicality equation to be unsolvable, ergo time travel is impossible. But I can't quite prove it, Bubblegum. Perhaps you and your razzle dazzle Globetrotter calculus could ..."
351,Bubblegum,"Looks pretty damn solvable to me, Farnsy. Sweet Clyde, use variation of parameter and expand the Wronskian."
352,Farnsworth,"Shizz, baby. So paradox free time travel is possible after all."
353,Bubblegum,Right on. But dig this multiplicand here.
354,Farnsworth,The doom field? That must be what corrects the paradoxes.
355,Curly Joe,"When that momma rises exponentially, it could rupture the very fabric of causality."
356,Nibbler,That's what I've been trying to tell you.
357,Farnsworth,"Hermes, you got your body back. Hurrah!"
358,Hermes,"Yes, but not the original. Bender went back in time and picked up a copy."
359,Bubblegum,"A copy! Funky cold medina. According to this equation, a time travel duplicate results in a complex denominator in the causality ratio."
360,Sweet Clyde,Oh Snap! Bet you know what that means.
361,Hermes,"I can guess. Actually, I can't guess."
362,Bubblegum,"Prof, you got a doom meter in this lab."
363,Farnsworth,"Good Lord, Bubblegum. The duplicate body is emitting doom at ten times the back ground level."
364,Bubblegum,I thought as much. A duplicate body is always doomed. It's just a matter of time.
365,Hermes,I don't care. I just need it long enough to bird dog in an win LaBarbara back.
366,Bubblegum,Best bird dog fast my brother.
367,Hermes,That the way I bird dog best.
368,Lars,"Drink, quick. I can't balance it much longer."
369,Leela,Wait .. I ..
370,Lars,Yes!
371,Leela,This is so much fun Lars. Most men are intimidated by the fact that I could kill them with the flick of my wrist.
372,Lars,"Well not me. 'Cause if you do, you'll be stuck with the check."
373,Elzar,"Folks, care for a little fresh ground executive?"
374,Leela,Please.
375,Elzar,Bam!
376,Elzar,"Don't get excited kids, this thing's got heart shaped nostrils. Want to see it make a star?"
377,Leela and Lars,No!
378,Bender,Here's your Gutenberg Bible master. Plus the Colonel's secret recipe
379,Fleb,"Well, that does it. We've got every valuable object in history."
380,Fry,Owww!
381,Nudar,Hmm. Now that I'm rich I suddenly care if the universe gets destroyed. We can't use that dangerous time code again. Blank it from the robot's memory.
382,Bender,Ahhhhh.
383,Nudar,I'll vaporize this guy so his ass doesn't fall into the wrong hands.
384,Fry,Why don't you just remove my tattoo?
385,Nudar,Nice try. But you might have memorized it.
386,Fry,No I mighn't. I can't even remember my mother's maiden name.
387,Nudar,It's Gleisner.
388,Fry,Stupid naked aliens. Stupid Lars. I hate the future.
389,Fry,Hmmmm!
390,Bubblegum,"Man, that cube root was a real buzzer beater, Clyde."
391,Fry,Zero. One. One. One. Zero. Zero. One. One!
392,Schlump,Blast him.
393,Bender,Ha ha! You missed!  Oh great master.
394,Fry,Hello 2000. I'm home.
395,Voice,"Happy New Year, naked weirdo!"
396,Fry,Happy new year.
397,Nudar,"Well, we'll never know where the ass guy went, and since we can't kill him, I say live and let live."
398,Bender,"Aww, that's sweet boss. Fry'll be nice and cozy back in the year 2000."
399,Nudar,What?! How do you know he went to the year 2000?
400,Bender,That's where he always goes.
401,Nudar,Hmm. Better play it safe. Go there a little earlier and wait for him. You know what to do.
402,Bender,"You want me to concludify him, like some sort of dispatcherator?"
403,Nudar,Yes. And don't forget to terminate him.
404,Bender,Got it. Preparing to terminate Philip Fry!
405,Schlump,What's with the doofy sunglasses?
406,Bender,It's really bright in the past.
407,Bender,"Ok, Fry. Come ta poppa. ... Man I'm bored.  Ohhh!"
408,Bender,"Hey, there you are! ... Oh, wait, that's Fry before he goes to the future. I'm waiting for the one who comes back from the future. Geesh this is confusing, and I bet it's gonna get a lot more confusing. Offf. That cheap beer really goes right through you. For the first time ever, I gotta use the bathroom, but if I leave, I might miss Fry. Ohhhh unless ...."
409,Bender-2,... and I bet it's gonna get a lot more confusing. Huh! Ah! Wha?
410,Bender,"Hi, I'm you from 19 seconds in the future. Stay here and wait for Fry while I go to the bathroom."
411,Bender-2,Ok Boss. After I kill Fry you're next.
412,Bender,What?
413,Bender-2,Nothing.
414,Bender-2,What the? Who are you?
415,Bender-3,I'm Bender from way at the end. I came back to put this rub-on time code on Fry's ass.
416,Bender-2,"So what are you now, a butler? Spot of tea please, jerkwad!"
417,Bender-3,"It's called class, you yokel. Now if you'll excuse me, I have a buttocks to tattoo."
418,Fry,Hello 2000. I'm home.
419,Voice,"Happy New Year, naked weirdo!"
420,Fry,Happy new year.
421,Bender-2,"Hasta la vista, meatbag!"
422,Fry,"Bender? What are you doing? It's me, your best friend."
423,Bender-2,Must obey orders. Ohhhhh. Mustn't kill friend!! Ohhhhhh!!! Badly want to urinate!!!!!
424,Fry,What's happening? Are you urinating?
425,Bender-2,"Explosion in seven, six, ..."
426,Fry,It'll be a cold day in hell my friend.
427,Bender-2,"Hey, I'm supposed to be the one saying cool things!"
428,Bender,"Hey ... so the game of cat and mouse begins, huh? Let us match wits. .... Ohhhh, how am I supposed to find him? All those times he blabbed on and on about his life in the twentieth century. If only I'd paid the slightest bit of attention. Oh well, guess I'd better go kill myself."
429,Cryogenicist,"Hello, bartender? I have thought it over, and far from being a fat pig, you are very nice and I would like another drink ..."
430,Bender,"Take a barf buddy. Ok suicide booth, give me your best shot. Electrocution please, side order of poison.  Helloooo? Kill me you stupid machine. ... What the ... local calls fifty cents? It's a street corner telephone parlor! Oh what kind of horrible suicide free time is this? Wait a minute, maybe this handy encyclopedia of humans will help me track Fry down."
431,Bender,"One of these Frys must be Fry. Look out Philip Fry, 'cause I got a little present for you."
432,Fat Man,My name is Phillip Fry. Where's my present.
433,Bender,Hang on a second Fry. I don't remember you being that ugly.
434,Fat Man,"Oh no, I've always been this ugly."
435,Bender,"Huh. Let me see your ass.  No tattoo. Okay, you can go."
436,Fat Man,Farewell sir.
437,Bender,"Say your prayers, Fry."
438,Michelle,This isn't Fry. I kicked Fry out two hours ago. This is my new boyfriend ... uhhh ...
439,Constantine,Constantine.
440,Michelle,Really? That's a dumb name. Ewwww.
441,Bender,"Hmmm, could be a trick. Let me see your ass, Constantine.  Ohh, nice, now I see why she left Fry."
442,Bender,"Okay, you're still clean. I mean metaphorically."
443,Bender,"He must have left the city. Man, this could take all day."
444,Phil,"The returns are looking good, Mr. Gore."
445,Al Gore,"Thanks, Phil. Here's to four years of clean air, clean government, and amazing new technologies such as ..."
446,Al Gore,... ROBOT!
447,Bender,Philip Fry?
448,Transition Announcer,Twelve years passed. Then ...
449,Transition Announcer,... this.
450,Bender,Philip J. Fry?
451,"Yancy Fry, Jr.","Phil, some kind of trash can here to see you. He's coming."
452,Philip J. Fry II,Are you made of Tinkertoy?
453,Bender,Hmmm. It's been twelve years. Maybe I'm getting taller.
454,Philip J. Fry II,You're not getting smarter.
455,Bender,"Listen, pipsqueak, are you Philip J. Fry or not? 'Cause if you are, I'm here to kill you."
456,Philip J. Fry II,I'd like to see you try.
457,Philip J. Fry II,You---you--you want Uncle Phil. He went to the North Pole on a fishyboat.
458,Bender,Ahhhh! The North Pole? I was just there.
459,Bender,"One ticket to the North Pole, please, broom closet class.  It is him, I'd recognize me, and hence him, anywhere."
460,Bender,Follow that guy. There's an extra hundred in it for you if you follow him so close that you run him over.
461,Al Gore,Yes sir.
462,Al Gore,Dang. That hundred dollars could have bought me one. Gallon. Of gas.
463,Bender,"Ohhh! I lost him. People will call me a failure.  Others however will call me the world's sexiest killing machine who's fun at parties. Fry, old buddy, it's me, Bender."
464,Bender,"Wooo! I totally killed him.  Oh god, what have I done?"
465,Bender,Preparing to terminate Philip Fry.
466,Schlump,What's with the doofy sun glasses?
467,Bender,It's really bright in the past.
468,Bender,Mission accomplished.
469,Schlump,Fry is dead?
470,Bender,No other robot could have done it. It took twelve years of tireless stalking but I hunted down and killed my best friend.  I'm the greatest.
471,Head cleaner,Time code and obedience virus erased.
472,Bender,Huh?
473,Head cleaner,"Also, fifty terabytes of porn."
474,Bender,Hey!
475,Nudar,"You've got no porn, no code, and you're ugly! Let's dance!"
476,Leela,Now it's true we'll all miss Fry.
477,Zoidberg,He was the only one of you who never struck me.
478,Leela,And we'll never see if boyish smile and hair horn again. But I bet he went back to his own time. I'm sure he was very happy and lived to a ripe old age.
479,Bender,He wasn't and he didn't!
480,Bender,"Struggling alone again incredible odds, I, Bender, managed to kill him."
481,Amy,"Awww, don't blame yourself, Bender."
482,Bender,"I don't blame myself, I blame all of you."
483,Amy,Us?! How can you possibly blame us?
484,Bender,"It ain't easy. It just proves how great I am.  Ohhh, Fry, I'd give anything to unmurder you!"
485,Fry,Did someone call me?
486,Bender,No.  But ... I killed you in 2012. Unless ...
487,Fry,Ooph!
488,Bender,"Nope, he's not a zombie."
489,Lars,Welcome back Fry.
490,Fry,"Thank you, Lars."
491,Lars,"I .. ah ... I .. I'll see you later, honey."
492,Farnsworth,"So tell us Fry. If Bender killed you centuries ago, how in Satan's glorious name did you return?"
493,Fry,"Ohh, it's an astonishing tale of [[Coinage|incredibleness[[. It all began when I went back in time."
494,Farnsworth,Duhhh.
495,Fry,"Hey, Mr. Panucci, I'm back from that delivery to the cryogenic lab."
496,Panucci,Great. I'll put you on the cover of Big Whoop magazine!
497,Fry,"Mmmm, I'm starving. Can I have a slice?"
498,Panucci,Help yourself. Cash up front.
499,H.G. Blob,This note is legal tender.
500,Fry,"Unfortunately, I had no money from that era. But that's when it hit me - I knew where to find free pizza."
501,Fry,"Ohh, ice cold."
502,Fry,That's when it hit me again ...
503,Fry,But an hour ago this pizza's still lukewarm.  Zero zero one one zero ...
504,Bender-2,"Explosion in seven, six ..."
505,Fry-2,It'll be a cold day in hell my friend.
506,Bender-2,"Hey, I'm supposed to be the one saying cool things!"
507,Fry,"Nice kick, me."
508,Fry-2,Thanks. What are you doing here?
509,Fry,"One hour from now, I travel back in time for free pizza."
510,Fry-2,But Nibbler said not to use the time code.
511,Fry,"Fine, Mr. Responsible, don't use the code. Mmmmm. That pizza sure was good."
512,Fry-2,You pig.
513,Fry,Whatever.
514,Fry,That's when it hit me yet a third time ...
515,Fry,"You idiot, frozen me's still got a wallet full of old timey money."
516,Fry,"Yuck, I touched my own butt."
517,Fry,So I unfroze ten minutes ago and I walked over here and then it was now and then I don't know what happened.
518,Bender,"Well, I'm glad you're alive, but I don't want people to say I'm incompetent so I better kill you again. Hold still."
519,Farnsworth,Bender! Stop killing for a minute. The Fry you murdered was doomed anyway. See?
520,Bender,What'd ya got there? Numbers?
521,Farnsworth,"When the time code duplicates a living thing, the copy is always doomed. And that includes flabby Jamaican potbellies."
522,Hermes,Kiss my front butt.
523,Fry,So my copy lives twelve years before Bender murdered him?
524,Bender,Brutally murdered.
525,Fry,I wonder what his life was like?
526,Scruffy,I guess we'll never know.
527,Zoidberg,Or will we?
528,Scruffy,Nope.
529,Transition Announcer,"They won't know, but you will. Lucky you."
530,Fry-2,"Oh hey Mr. Panucci, I'm back from the delivery to the cryogenic lab."
531,Panucci,I know. I read about it in Big Whoop magazine.
532,Fry-2,So ... uh ... my girlfriend kicked me out. Can I rent the upstairs storage room?
533,Panucci,"The upstairs storage?  I like you kid. Your lousy life makes me feel good about myself. The room's yours. Here, take some rat spray for the meat ball hamper."
534,Hermes,"Happy day, mon! It's good to have you back."
535,Nibbler,"Indeed, but the scammers will soon sprunje the code again. We must remove the time tattoo at once, and as painlessly as possible."
536,Lars,"Hurry, they're coming."
537,Nibbler,"There, the code is gone. I saved the space-time continuum and forty percent of your rectum."
538,Bubblegum,That's all you need.
539,Nudar,I sprunje code.
540,Nibbler,"Too late, Nudar. I've wiped Fry's butt clean."
541,Nudar,We'll see about that.
542,Fleb,Nothing boss. We sprunjed his ass inside and out.
543,Schlump,The only information we found was a hair shaped like the number six.
544,Nudar,"mmm. Nine. Alright, let him go, I guess the time code really is gone."
545,Fry,"Thank god. The present may stink, but at least now we can look forward to a better yesterday."
546,Fry-2,"I'm sorry Leela, I can't keep living in the past, by which I mean the future. I'll always love you, but I've got to move on and find my life's purpose."
547,TV Anchorman,... and that how Bundles the monkey finally found a friend.
548,Fry-2,I miss Morbo.
549,TV Anchorman,"And finally tonight on the late, cute animal news, a story that will really tug your heartstrings, way more than bundles, the doll-raping monkey. It's the tale of lonely Leelu, the little orphan narwhal."
550,Fry-2,Awww.
551,Dr. Schlovinowitz,"Leelu is a rare, toothed female narwhal who got disoriented and washed up in Atlantic City, as we all do from time to time. But without a mother, she's lost the will to eat.  Come on, take a sip."
552,Fry-2,I know how to make things eat. Maybe this is my purpose in life.
553,Fry,"Hi, I'd like to apply for a job working with Leelu."
554,Dr. Schlovinowitz,"Question number one, do you have any experience working with marine mammals?"
555,Fry-2,"No, but I think they're pretty neat."
556,Dr. Schlovinowitz,"That answers question number two. Question number three, do you know where the door is or would you prefer to be kicked out?"
557,Fry-2,I don't know. I guess kicked out.
558,Fry-2,"Hiya girl. My name's Fry, and I think you're a cutie 'cause I like things that have only one thing instead of two things."
559,Dr. Schlovinowitz,"Holy mackerel, she's eating whole mackerel. I don't know what your secret is but if you'll work for minimum wage you can start tomorrow."
560,Fry-2,"If I work of less than minimum, can I start today?"
561,Dr. Schlovinowitz,I don't see why not.
562,Morbo,"In business news, the weak and gullible inhabitants of Earth were plunged into economic depression today as the scammer aliens finished stealing every item of value, including ownership of this station."
563,Linda,
564,Nudar,Tough times earth chumps. We're repossessing your TV. Seems you can't afford it now that you're unemployed.
565,Zoidberg,We're not unemplo --
566,Lars,I love the hard museum at night. It's where I come to be alone.
567,Heads,Hi Lars.
568,De Gaulle,"Ah, Lars and la belle Leela. I trust you brought some haute cuisine for an old Frenchman."
569,Lars,"You're favorite General, Torgo's Executive Powder."
570,De Gaulle,Mmmm. Magnifique.
571,Lars,"Come on Leela, let me show you the hall of screaming skulls."
572,Leela,It's so romantic.
573,Lars,What's wrong? Is the screaming depressing you?
574,Leela,It's just ... my life is changing so fast. I don't know who I am anymore.
575,Lars,I know who you are. You're the woman I've been waiting for all my life.
576,Leela,Let's go to my place.
577,Lars,I ... like what you've done with it.
578,Leela,"""All tenants evicted, signed new owners""?"
579,Nudar,"That would be us, dump cakes. We're buying the whole city and turning it into a private panda hunting reserve.  Na-na-na!!"
580,Leela,There aren't any Pandas in New New York.
581,Schlump,"Back it up, Sal!"
582,Amy,"Look at us, living like trash eating bums in an alley now."
583,Zoidberg,Yes. Now.
584,Tinny Tim,"And on Xmas eve, the most wonderful night of the  ooofff."
585,Bender,Oops.
586,Farnsworth,"Well, at least we have each other, so it truly is the worst Xmas ever."
587,Hermes,Santa!
588,"""'Santa","Ah, the Planet Express crew. According to my list  you've all been very naughty. I'll be back for you after I collect my milk and cookies from starving orphans."
589,Fry,That's it. I don't see how things could get any worse.
590,Bender,We could sing.
591,Farnsworth,I'd rather kill myself.
592,Amy,Why not do both?
593,Farnsworth,"Oh, very well."
594,Nudar,Neh!
595,Leela,Lars brought me candy.
596,"Fry, Amy, Zoidberg, Bender, Tinny Tim, and Nibbler",Cram it down and shut the hell up!
597,Hermes,I can't compete with that.
598,Leela,Lars says I'm dreamy.
599,"Fry, Zoidberg, Amy, Tinny Tim, Bender, Farnsworth",Who the hell cares?
600,Santa,That's my cue.
601,Tinny Tim,Oh my word!
602,Leela,"Hey, guess what guys!"
603,Zoidberg,What?
604,Fanrsworth,Congratulations!
605,Zoidberg,Mazel tov!
606,Amy,May stars in heaven bless your love!
607,Fry,Now could things get any worse.
608,Santa,Ho! Ho! Ho.
609,Lars,Stop screaming. That's just what the bomb wants us to do.
610,Zoidberg,I say do what it tells us.
611,Lars,"Don't worry, a bomb in a case is just like a head in a jar."
612,Leela,Oh Lars! No blowing us up make me love you even more.
613,Fry,Life saving goody goody ...
614,Farnsworth,"Well now that death has been staved off momentarily, let me be the first to say congratulations Leela and Lars."
615,Amy,Maid of honor!
616,Zoidberg,Maid of honor! Ohhh.
617,Fry,"I could make you happy too, if only you'd give me a chance."
618,Dr. Schlovinowitz,"You've done a wonderful job, Fry. When you first started, I thought she'd be dead within a narweek, which is six days I believe."
619,Fry-2,Nah. Leelu's a champ. She just needed someone to show her how to eat.
620,Dr. Schlovinowitz,Now that the kind of whale behavioral science they don't teach you in whale behavioral science class.
621,Fry,"So what's up, Dr. Schlovinowitz?"
622,Dr. Schlovinowitz,"This is a little hard for me to say Fry. You see, it's ... it's time we released Leelu back into the wild."
623,Dr. Schlovinowitz,I'm sorry. The decision is final. Plus we need the tank for the Loch Ness monster.
624,Fry-2,But that turned out to be a log with a Halloween mask stapled to it.
625,Dr. Schlovinowitz,"Yes, well, it still draws a crowd."
626,Fry-2,"I can't let this happen, she'll never be happy without me."
627,Elzar,I know you're broke and homeless but you still want a swank wedding reception so I whipped you up some real nice budge appetizers.
628,Lars,Mmmm. I can keep these down.
629,Elzar,"Okay! That's a big ""yes"" on the crud puffs. Try the shlimp cocktail."
630,Fry,There must be some way I can stop this wedding. What if I steal the wedding ring?
631,Bender,Already taken care of.
632,Fry,You think that'll be enough to stop the ceremony.
633,Bender,"Nope. I pulled the old switcheroo, so they won't even know the difference. Wait a minute, I think the copy I made cost more than this."
634,Fry,Cheap lousy Lars.
635,Bender,"Actually this is extremely nice, but I really went all out on the copy. It was sorta my gift to them."
636,Fry,I can't let this happen. She'll never be happy without me.
637,Fry-2,"It's not fair, we need each other."
638,Panucci,"Fry, you dumb sack, I don't care about your problems at all!"
639,Fry-2,You need your blanket Mr. Panucci.
640,Panucci,"I don't even want to be here. I only came 'cause you wheeled me. But if that narwal means so much to you, you gotta do something."
641,Fry-2,I know. But I can't just go chasing after her. That'd be nuts.
642,Panucci,"Ah, Sometimes you gotta be a little nuts. Let me introduce you to my cousin. He owns a small freighter. That's him, right behind us."
643,Fry-2,"Sir, I'd like to engage your ship for a trans-Arctic voyage to capture a Narwhal and bring it back to my room."
644,Panucci,"The mans is nuts, Leroy."
645,Leroy,"Professional whale keeper, eh? I've carried your type before and we don't get along. Oh, I agree with your values and your goals and your methods, but somehow we just never click on a personal level."
646,Fry-2,I'm not a professional anymore. Just a narwal loving private citizen.
647,Leroy,Then I'm you man. We'll take on three barrels of fresh sausage and sail at dawn.
648,Terry,Welcome to the wedding.
649,Fry,
650,Bender,"Yeah, once they try to sign that license, all hell will break look.  Oy vey."
651,LaBarbara,"Go on now, mon, don' cha' know nothin' about zippin' up a woman's frock?"
652,Slim,
653,Hermes,"Get your clumsy, muscular hands off my woman, Barbados."
654,LaBarbara,Hermes! Your body!
655,Slim,I always said you were a little backward.
656,Hermes,"Well, I always said you were a little forward ... with my wife."
657,Bystanders,ohhh!
658,Hermes,Consider yourself bird dogged.
659,LaBarbara,"That's my man. Take a boat, Barbados."
660,Bubblegum,"Brother, you gots to tell that sweet thing your time duplicate body is doomed."
661,Hermes,"Tomorrow morning. After the ""festivities""."
662,Bubblegum,"Yow, baby!"
663,Munda,Our little girl is finally getting married. And to a normal two eyed human.
664,Morris,"Eh, he's not good enough for her. Leela deserves a guy with a dozen eyes."
665,Munda,Quit trying to fix her up with Fly Mutant.
666,Father Changstein-el-Gamahl,"Dearly liked, we are gathered here before one or more gods, or fewer, to joining this couple in pretty good matrimony. If anyone objects to this union, let them speak now or forever hold their piece, or do something else."
667,Leroy,"It's been two years, Fry. We've caught a hundred and eight narwhals and set them all free again."
668,Fry-2,None of them were Leelu.
669,Inuit #1,But all of them were edible.
670,Inuit #2,Can we at least eat that one? I'm sick of sausage.
671,Fry-2,I'd know that modified extended tooth anywhere. To the boats!
672,Fry-2,"Leelu! Leelu! It's me, Fry."
673,Fry-2,"Oh, I've missed you too, Leelu. But we'll never be apart again because we care too much for each other. Fire!"
674,Father Changstein-el-Gamahl,"Now, if the couple will sign the wedding license."
675,Farnsworth,I warned him. I warned him a time paradox duplicate is always doomed.
676,Lars,What?
677,LaBarbara,"Oh, no, my man! He's essentially dead again."
678,Dr. Cahill,Relax ma'am. Your husband's original body will be repaired within one week.
679,LaBarbara,Nah uh uh. Not soon enough. Boy needs a daddy.
680,Slim,"Cruel runnings, mon."
681,Dr. Cahill,"Woopsy-doopsy, poopsy."
682,Hermes,"Well, let's get on with it. Don't let my doomed body and my doomed marriage stand in the way of your happiness."
683,Lars,"No, it's not right. We don't want our happy day tainted by misfortune and tragedy, do we?"
684,Leela,I'm OK with it.
685,Lars,"No, it's not right. The wedding is off."
686,Bender,Oh my goodness!
687,Fry,"Finally, a happy ending."
688,TV Announcer,And now it's time for Everybody Loves Hypnotoad.
689,Zoidberg,"Even in a depression, the entertainment industry thrives."
690,Fry,"Are you okay, Leela?"
691,Leela,"Yeah, I'm just a little down 'cause the only man I'll ever love left me at the altar. Plus I live in a dumpster."
692,Zoidberg,You stay out of my dumpster!
693,Announcer,We interrupt this episode of Everybody Loves Hypnotoad to bring you a special address from Earth President Nixon.
694,Announcer,"Please, Hypnotoad, it's beyond my control. No! Don't make me kill myseIf!"
695,Nixon,"My fellow Earthicans, I've just received some really great news. I'm about to close a deal that will allow us to buy Earth back from the scammers."
696,Bender,That'll teach those scammers and me.
697,Nixon,"Just when things looked darkest, I received an e-mail from the Andrrrrrrromeda Galaxy. lt seems we've won their quadrillion-dollar family sweepstakes!"
698,Leela,"Oh, Lord."
699,Nixon,"And all I had to do was hand over our last remaining land and water as collateral. So assuming all goes ...  Baroo! There ... seems to have been some ... We've been scammed again, people. Prepare to evacuate Earth. I mean, New Scamadonia."
700,"Nudar, Fleb and Schlump","Na-na-na-na, Na-na-na-na, Hey, hey, hey, We took your stuff!, etc."
701,Leela,All aboard for Neptune!
702,Farnsworth,"Oh, I don't want to go to Neptune. I'll be cold, and heavy."
703,Nudar,"Thanks for the planet, suckers."
704,Bender,"It's so cold, my processor is running at peak efficiency."
705,Leela,"What are you, a whining machine? lf you want to worry about something, worry about the Yetis."
706,Zoidberg,"Yetis?  Oh, Yetis."
707,Farnsworth,"Amy, you speak Yeti. What are they saying?"
708,Amy,"I'm not sure, but it sounds like something to do with... ""assaulting the interlopers."""
709,Leela,"Don't mess with me, you ice-crapping snow-honkies. I just got dumped."
710,Hermes,"Sweet Yeti of the Serengeti, she's gone crazy eddie in the head-y."
711,Inuit #2,Is that normal?
712,Inuit #1,No. Perhaps if we were to cook and eat her slightly...
713,Fry-2,"Leave her alone. She just needs me to cheer her up. Wanna sword fight, girl?"
714,Fry-2,"That male narwhal seems to be upsetting her. Get us out of here, Captain. Full fast ahead."
715,Leroy,Damn whale keepers.
716,Leela,Santa! We forgot he's based on Neptune.
717,Santa,"Oh, my heart's not in it. I'm too depressed for murder and mayhem."
718,Amy,"Aw, try some antidepressants. They're gummy."
719,Fry,"What happened, Santa?"
720,Santa,The scammers cheated me out of my naughty list to use for telemarketing. Can you imagine the harm they could do with that information? I wanted to do that harm!
721,Leela,That's it. They've gone too far. No more running and hiding. It's time to fight back.
722,Santa,"Now, let's not resort to violence, Leela."
723,Leela,"We're fighting back and you're helping us, you fat holiday idiot."
724,Santa,That hurt. You're on the naughty list!
725,Leela,"So that's our proposal napkin, Mr. President. We have just enough people and ships to mount a ragtag attack."
726,Nixon,"You wish, missy. Dog-danged scammers used our money to build a fleet of remote-controlled, solid-gold Death Stars."
727,Bender,Ooh! I'd take one of those with a side of chili fries.
728,Nixon,"We're hopelessly outgunned. The Force is with us, but that's about it."
729,Santa,"Ah, but we have access to a huge manufacturing complex."
730,Kwanzabot,Kwanzabot
731,Chanukah Zombie,And the Chanukah zombie.
732,Neptunians,"Damn you!  Doo, doo, doodoo!"
733,Neptunians,"Says who? Doo, doo, doodoo!"
734,"Talmud says ""Be slow to anger”,Low-down scammers got me seeing red.Got my TIE fighter out of the hangar,Jump back, Jack 'cause I'm Jewish and I'm undead. Neptunians","Dreidl, dreidlI made it out of blasting clay"
735,Neptunians,"You're nuts. Doo, doo, doodoo!"

737,Santa,"Yeah, K?"
738,Kwanzabot,CZ?
739,'Chanukah Zombie,"Hey, hey."
740,Santa,Can they sue for liability?
741,Nixon,Certainly not!
742,Santa,Use as much as you are able.
743,Neptunians,"This bites. Doo, doo, doodoo!"
744,Leela,"Now, let's fight."
745,Nixon,Let's fight.
746,Neptunians,"Doo, doo, doodoo!"
747,Santa,"Okay!Chestnuts roasting,I'm gonna open fire.Prepare for gore galore!"
748,"Santa, Chanukah Zombie and Kwanzabot",This trinity's going to war!
749,Leela,"Troops, you are now equipped with the finest weapons magical elves can build. As for the battle plan..."
750,Nixon,"And now, to present the battle plan, Commander Zapp Brannigan!"
751,Leela,What?
752,Zapp,"At ease, people. I was redecorating my undisclosed location when I received word of an heroic invasion. Kif, crouch down and shield my thighs from the cold, for God's sake."
753,Zapp,"We fight this battle, not for ourselves, but for our children and our children's children. Which is why I'm forming a children's brigade. Will the following youths please step forward? Cubert Farnsworth."
754,Cubert,"Here, sir!"
755,Farnsworth,"My boy. Oh, God, no!"
756,Zapp,Dwight Slim.
757,Dwight,Here.
758,Hermes,"You took his name? Oh, God, no! In several ways!"
759,Zapp,"Assuming the 15th pile of children buys us a few seconds, we will then execute maneuver 45. Followed by maneuver 44."
760,Kif,Forty-six.
761,Zapp,"Oh, great. Now I have to start back at the beginning with maneuver two."
762,Kif,One.
763,Lars,"Admiral, will we stop attacking at any point or is this one of those phony-baloney, feel-good wars like the war on drugs?"
764,Zapp,"What's your name, smart mouth?"
765,Lars,Lars Fillmore.
766,Zapp,"Ah, the lovely Leela's on-again, off-again paramour. Perhaps a suicide mission would knockthe insubordination out of you."
767,Leela,"Yes, yes, yes."
768,Kif,"We're approaching Earth, sir."
769,Zapp,"Who? Oh, planet Earth. The big blue velour marble. All commanders stand by. Prepare to transfer battle control to the main duper-computer on my mark! Ten, nine, eigh---"
770,Leela,Does anybody mind if I take command?
771,Nibbler,No.
772,Sal,Nos.
773,Bubblegum,Nah.
774,Al Gore,Nope.
775,Cubert,"No, Miss Turanga."
776,Donbot,"No, I do not."
777,Santa,No.
778,Kwanzabot,It's cool.
779,Chanukah Zombie,Argh!
780,Leela,"All right. Unit one, acquire target A and fire!"
781,Fleb,Yes! Nailed the children's ship.
782,Leela,"Unit 10, Target H, 16-K. Niner, niner, go left! I mean right."
783,Sal,Whoas!
784,Leela,"55-U. 8-R, 2-V."
785,Farnsworth,Bingo!
786,Hattie,Cheating son of a...
787,Al Gore,Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
788,Leela,It's hopeless! I can't coordinate this many ships!
789,Hermes,"Perhaps I can help! Professor, can you wire my head directly into the battle grid?"
790,Farnsworth,I can wire anything directly into anything. I'm the professor!
791,Hermes,Then prepare to see a bureaucrat's brain in action.
792,Al Gore,"Finally, I get to save the Earth with deadly lasers instead of deadly slide shows."
793,Clamps,He's champing for a clamping!
794,Kwanzabot,Kwa-zang!
795,Hermes,"I did it! I saved Earth and won back my woman. Right, woman?"
796,LaBarbara,"Oh, Hermes, I've been such a fool. Truth be, I married you for your sexy potato body,but I'm staying with you for your sexy potato head."
797,Slim,"You haven't seen the last of Barbados Slim! Now, goodbye forever."
798,Nudar,"Nice attack, doo-doo heads! Too bad we have one last trick up our sleeve!"
799,Amy,I doubt that!
800,Nudar,"Remember this, Farnsworth?"
801,Farnsworth,Farnsworth? That's me! My doomsday device! So it was the scammers! They sawed off my hand and stole the doomsday device.
802,Bender,"lt wasn't them. lt was me, Bender. The master criminal!"
803,Nudar,So what'll it be? - Unconditional surrender?
804,Leela,Never!
805,Nudar,Or totaI destruction?
806,Leela,Also never!
807,Nudar,You have 30 seconds. Make up your minds!
808,Leela,Nevvveeeeer!
809,Bender,"People, I'm sorry. You've never before heard me say those words, or even the individual letters that make them up. But I am. And with a huge amount of modesty, I humbly beg your forgiveness."
810,Bender,Shut up and keep looking apologized to.
811,Leela,Dum de dum.
812,Nudar,Uh-oh. I have a worrisome shriveling sensation in my sprunjer.
813,Amy,Yay! Bender!
814,Fry,All right!
815,Fry,"Bender, how the Hulk did you end up with the doomsday device?"
816,Bender,"I was working the long con all along. While sawing off the professor's hand with an extremely dull saw, I had some time to think. So I asked myself, ""Who could use a doomsday device more? The scammers or me, Bender?"". After several minutes of sawing, I knew the answer. Me, Bender. So I retrieved the dummy satchel ..."
817,Bender,"... and as soon as I was out of the scammers' control, I pulled the old switcheroo."
818,Bender,And that's how I saved Earth and am the greatest!
819,Nixon,"Bender the robot, I'm proud to present you Earth's highest award for swindling. The Dirty Double-Cross."
820,Bender,I'll aways treasure it and immediately hock it.
821,Lars,"There, your body's good as new. Just pop in an executive suppository every few..."
822,Fry,What is it?
823,Leela,Nothing.
824,Fry,"It's supposed to be a celebration, Leela. I mean, come on. Whimmy-wham-wham-whazle!"
825,Leela,I can't help it. I was gonna be married. I was so happy.
826,Fry,"Well, maybe you'll meet someone else someday."
827,Leela,"No, you don't understand. Lars is the only man I'll ever love. I know it in my heart."
828,Fry,You remember when we first met?
829,Leela,"Uh-huh. lt was right there in the cryogenic lab, eight years ago today."
830,Fry,Meet me there in five minutes. It's important.
831,Fry-2,"Why are you so sad, Leelu?"
832,Fry-2,"Him again?  Wait a second, are you two..."
833,Fry-2,"Atanarjuat, Fufu, come here! We have to set Leelu free."
834,Inuit #2,Dang. I never should have quit my job at the casino.
835,Fry-2,"Me, neither. But she needs what'll make her happy, not what'll make me happy."
836,Fry-2,"Goodbye, Leelu."
837,Lars,"I don't much know about frozen heads, but, of course, if it's Mahatma Gandhi, I'll... Leela?"
838,Leela,Lars?
839,Lars,"I... I really have to go, I..."
840,Leela,"Fry, was this an idiotic trick to get Lars and me back together?"
841,Fry,"Quite idiotic. But you don't need to be an idiot to see that you two belong together. And, Leela,I want what'll make you happy, not what'll make me happy."
842,Lars,"I'm sorry, I really am, but Leela and I just can't be married."
843,Fry,"Why not? You obviously love each other. What are you, cousins?"
844,Lars,"Fry, you deserve to know the truth. It's because..."
845,Nudar,Nobody move!
846,Leela,Nudar! How did you survive the doom blast?
847,Nudar,"My doom-proof platinum vest absorbed most of the radiation. In retrospect, I wish I'd been wearing doom-proof pants, but you know us nudists. Now give me the time code!"
848,Fry,I don't have it! Nibbler heat-blasted it off my butt.
849,Nudar,Not you.
850,Nudar,You!
851,Leela,Lars? He doesn't have it. He never had it. Fry had it!
852,Fry,But Nibbler heat-blasted it off my butt! I want to stress that part!
853,Nudar,My throbbing sprunjer says otherwise. Now where is it?
854,Lars,I'm not afraid of you or your expensive gun! Go ahead and shoot!
855,Nudar,"Oh, yeah? Then what if I kill the woman you love?"
856,Leela,"Don't you understand, numb-neck? He doesn't love me!"
857,Lars,I've... always loved you. Don't hurt her. I'll give you the code.
858,Nudar,What the...
859,Bender-2,Woah!
860,Leela,"Lars, no!"
861,Fry-2,It's enough just to know you're happy.
862,Fry-2,"You, too. It's enough to know you're happy with Lars."
863,Bender,"Fry, old buddy! It's me! Bender!"
864,Fry-2,My hair!
865,Fry-2,My larynx!
866,Lars,I'm Lars?  I'm Lars!
867,Fry,"Wait for me, Leela! I'll be there in a thousand years."
868,Lars,"So I got a job at the Head Museum and waited for the wonderful day when Leela would arrive. Everything was perfect until Hermes exploded at our wedding. That's when I learned that, as a time paradox duplicate, I, too, was doomed. I couldn't put Leela through that. So I called it off. I'm sorry, Leela."
869,Leela,I understand.
870,Crazy Guy,That concludes another Silly Willy Wideo Will!
871,Fry,"He was a good man, Leela."
872,Leela,Yeah... you were.
873,Farnsworth,"Well, I guess that wraps everything up in a nice, paradox-free bow."
874,Bubblegum,"Not quite, my wrinkly brother."
875,Nibbler,"Right on! In order for any of this to make any sense at all, someone must make one final trip back in time to put the code on Fry's ass in the first place!"
876,Bender,"Sounds like a job for me, Bender."
877,Bender,"Zero, zero, one, one, zero, zero..."
878,Bender,Mission accomplished!
879,Fry,You put the time code on my ass?
880,Bender,"Someone's ass. Oh, and guess what? I met all these really cool guys with treasure down in the limestone cavern, so I invited them to stick around instead of coming up when they were logically supposed to."
881,Nibbler,No! No! Everyone out of the universe! Quick!
882,Bender,What's the worst that can happen?
883,Bender,"Well, we're boned."
884,Narrator,Previously on Futurama.
885,Morbo,It has now been one month since space ripped open like flimsy human skin. Terrified earthlings are beginning to grow exhausted.
886,Hermes,"Professor, sprinkle us with wisdom from your mighty brain. How scared should we be?"
887,Farnsworth,Somewhere between not at all and entirely.
888,Zoidberg,I call entirely.
889,Morbo,"Scientists believe the rip is a gateway to another universe, but do not know what mysteries lie beyond. However, in this reporter's opinion gruesome death awaits us all!"
890,Linda,"And now with sports, here's Sportsbot 5000."
891,SportsBot 5000,All sports cancelled.
892,Farnsworth,"To better understand the anomaly, I will now focus its radiation on a giant medium-sized ant to see what happens."
893,Giant medium-sized ant,What's going on here? I was told there would be sugar syrup.
894,Farnsworth,"Quiet, you."
895,Fry,"Oh, hey, everyone, this is Colleen."
896,ALL,Hello!
897,Amy,I like your shoes.
898,Bender,This is awkward. Introducing your new girlfriend to Chesty McNag-nag.
899,Leela,"Oh, don't mind him. I'II turn him off."
900,Bender,"Hey, you can't turn me off..."
901,Leela,Hi. I'm Leela.
902,Colleen,"Hi, Leela, hi, everyone. Sorry I've been taking up so much of Fry's time. He's just so interesting. Have you seen how much cotton candy he can eat?"
903,Farnsworth,"Oh, my, yes. 5.1 pounds. That's why his blood is so good on pancakes."
904,Fry,"Well, got to skedoodle-oodle. We're taking a cuddle-cab to Hug-a-Bunny Village."
905,Zoidberg,This lovey-dovey stuff is making me vomit from my saltwater and freshwater stomachs.
906,Leela,It is pretty sickening.
907,Zoidberg,"No, the double-vomit is a sign of joy. Fry told me how he and Colleen first met."
908,Zoidberg,"So, how did you and Colleen first meet?"
909,Fry,Well...
910,Fry,Something about seeing it on the Jumbotron makes it so much more real.
911,Colleen,It's so scary. What are you supposed to do when the whole universe is coming to an end?
912,Fry,I have a thought.
913,Bender,"This is gonna be juicy. What? Oh, man!"
914,Amy,"Speaking of sappy love... Want to tell them, Kiffy?"
915,Kif,"Yes, Amy and I have a big announcement. I... That is, we... Oh, I'm just so excited."
916,Amy,Kif has asked me to be his Fonfon Ru.
917,Zoidberg,Mazel tov!
918,Farnsworth,Wonderful!
919,Hermes,What the hell does that mean?
920,Kif,It means I've asked Amy to join my family. And you're all invited to my family swamp for our Fonfon Rubok ceremony.
921,Amy,"If I had ever heard of it, it would have been what I had always dreamed of."
922,Kif,Oh! And our parents will be meeting for the first time ever.
923,Bender,
924,Kif,"Mr. And Mrs. Wong, aren't you excited that we're all about to be joined in a single family?"
925,Mr. Wong,You can't borrow money.
926,Mrs. Wong,Kif's parents come late and we have to stand around in swamp getting eaten alive by damn bugs? [She squashes a bug on her neck
927,Kif,"Mrs. Wong, no. The finial stage of my species' life cycle is a colony of flying hookworms. You just squashed part of my father."
928,Mr. Kroker,Welcome.
929,Mrs. Wong,"Sorry. I guess you got plenty of bugs to spare though, huh?"
930,Mr. Kroker,That was my left testicle.
931,Bender,"And the awkward meter goes up another notch. Ding, ding, ding, ding ding..."
932,Fry,"Wow, Colleen, you look so beautiful in the light of the swamp gas."
933,Colleen,Thanks. This is really fun. I love going to exotic worlds and getting hammered.
934,Fry,"Me, too."
935,Bartender,Two more Harvey Wallclimbers.
936,Zapp,"Leela, I can't help but notice you're unescorted. Might I escort you behind that bush for the next five minutes?"
937,Leela,Nothing would revolt me more.
938,Zapp,Then how about that shrub?
939,Kif,Ooh! Rubok is begun.
940,Grand Midwife,I am the Grand Priestess.
941,Fry,Aren't you also the Grand Midwife?
942,Grand Midwife,"And the grand Lunch Lady. I work five jobs, all grand. Kif of the clan Kroker, please transcend the Rubok Etlon with your Fonfon Smizmar Ru."
943,Kif,What?
944,Grand Midwife,"Get in the mud. This mud is the petroleum from a billion generations of Kif's ancestors.  As you become one with the ooze, so you become one with the clan Kroker."
945,Amy,"Oh, Kif, it's like a movie with this happening in it."
946,Grand Midwife,Is the best man present?
947,Zapp,Guilty as charged.
948,Grand Midwife,Kindly hose the couple.
949,Grand Midwife,It's not part of the ceremony. I just had an extra snake. Rubok is complete. Throw the bouquet.
950,Zoidberg,Are you going to eat that?
951,Bender,"Fry, run, run. Get over here, oh, my God, oh, my God!"
952,Fry,What? What is it?
953,Bender,Shut up already! Calculon's on TV!
954,Monique,"I beg you, Calculon, don't ring that door chime."
955,Calculon,"I have no choice, Monique. Whoever the blackmailer is, he lives behind this hideous yet strangely familiar door."
956,Human Friend,"Calculon residence. Oh, hello, Mr. Calculon."
957,Calculon,"Son of a bit. This is my house. But that means I'm blackmailing myself. Why didn't you tell me, Monique?"
958,Monique,"I tried to, but I couldn’t. Oh, Calculon, I'm afraid you have a fourth personality the other three don't know about, and it and I are lovers!"
959,Bender,"How's Calculon going to take this, Fry, especially after that humiliating tennis tournament? Fry?"
960,Fry,"Don't know, Bender. Tonight's my big date with Colleen. I got to run."
961,Bender,"But me and you like to watch together. Look, I got you a cabbage to snack on. Humans like cabbage, right?"
962,Carnival Barker,"Step right up to the 2D Tunnel of Love. Not one, not three, but two glorious dimensions for the price of a single ticket.  Keep your hands in the car, shut up, and have fun."
963,Fry,"Wow, you even look beautiful in 2D."
964,Colleen,"I do? But from your perspective, I'm just a line segment."
965,Fry,"A really hot line segment. So, listen, sweetie pie, I was thinking maybe we should take this to the next step."
966,Colleen,Really?
967,Fry,Yes. Colleen...will you be moved in with by me?
968,Colleen,
969,Amy,Way to go.
970,Zoidberg,"Hooray, hooray."
971,Leela,That's great.
972,Bender,You're moving in with her? Why can't she move in with us?  I could just curl up at the foot of the bed.
973,Farnsworth,"Listen up, everyone. I know you've all been extremely worried about the cosmic anomaly."
974,Hermes,"The what? Oh, right."
975,Farnsworth,But there's good news! We're all going to learn more about it at a scientific conference.
976,Man walking on screen,...like a city made of marshmallow.
977,Stephen Hawking's head,Welcome. I am the pickled head of Stephen Hawking on a way-cool rocket.
978,Leela,"Black hole Hawking? Wow, if I knew I was going to meet you I would have done something with my hair."
979,Stephen Hawking,You should have.
980,Stephen Hawking,"In conclusion, I understand nothing about the anomaly, even after cashing the huge check I got for writing a book about it."
981,Farnsworth,"I know this anomaly is terrifying. But as scientists, is it not our sworn duty to seek out knowledge, even at the cost of our very lives?"
982,Stephen Hawking,No.
983,Farnsworth,I say we must mount an expedition to the anomaly forthwith.
984,Wernstrom,I agree.
985,Farnsworth,Wernstrom!
986,Farnsworth,Don't listen to that crackpot!
987,Wernstrom,But I'm agreeing with you.
988,Farnsworth,"I'll make you eat those words, you moron!"
989,Wernstrom,Ah!  I volunteer to lead the expedition. I have a squad of graduate students eager to risk their lives for a letter of recommendation.
990,Farnsworth,Your squad sucks bosons! My team is twice as qualified and three times as expendable.
991,The PE Crew,Yeah!
992,Wernstrom,"Oh, tough talk for someone with only one Fields Medal."
993,Crowd,Ooh!
994,Stephen Hawking,Ooh!
995,Farnsworth,"Wernstrom, I ought to..."
996,Stephen Hawking,I didn't know I could do that. Now quiet down and settle this like men of science.
997,Professor,Very well.
998,Professor,Let Deathball begin!
999,Farnsworth,"Go, Planet Express!"
1000,Wernstrom,"Go even more, my team!"
1001,Fry,"Leela, header!"
1002,Colleen,Woo hoo! Bust those balls!
1003,Zoidberg,Hooray! We're equally good!
1004,Leela,"Come on, Bender! Your grandmother could push harder than that!"
1005,Bender,No crap. My grandmother was a bulldozer.
1006,Bender,And thus metal man defeated meat man. The end.
1007,Colleen,"Come here, winner!"
1008,Colleen,"Come here, loser!"
1009,Fry,"Colleen, what are you doing? My face is over here."
1010,Colleen,"This is my boyfriend, silly!"
1011,Fry,I thought I was your boyfriend.
1012,Colleen,You are.
1013,Fry,"Well, how can you have two boyfriends?"
1014,Colleen,"Oh, I don't. I have five.  Fry, meet Chu, Bolt, Ndulu, and Shlomo."
1015,Chu,Nihow.
1016,Ndulu,Greetings.
1017,Bolt,Pleasure.
1018,Fry,But... But...
1019,Colleen,Shlomo and Ndulu will help you move your stuff into my apartment tonight.
1020,Ndulu,"Welcome to the relationship, buddy!"
1021,Fry,Hmm?
1022,Chu,There's my butterscotch.
1023,Farnsworth,"Congratulations, Deathballers! We've won the right to explore the anomaly!"
1024,Zoidberg,What? I thought I was playing for my freedom!
1025,Farnsworth,"No.  Now, I've often said ""good news"" when sending you on a mission of extreme danger. So when I say this anomaly is dangerous, you can imagine how dangerous I really think it is."
1026,Hermes,Not dangerous at all?
1027,Farnsworth,"Actually, quite dangerous indeed."
1028,Hermes,That is quite dangerous!
1029,Farnsworth,Indeed. Now stop shilly-shallying! Prep the ship and line up for your pre-flight coffee enemas!
1030,Enema Bot,Warning. The enema you are about to enjoy is extremely hot.
1031,Fry,"I don't know what to do, Leela. Should I move in with Colleen and her four other boyfriends?"
1032,Leela,What are you going to do? Sleep in a big pile like hamsters?
1033,Fry,No! It's not like that. Everyone gets his own room and a shelf in the refrigerator.
1034,Zoidberg,"Take the deal, Fry! If there's a delicious cake, isn't it better to have one slice than none at all? Even if four other guys eat the other four slices, and they're all thrusting their sweaty naked bodies against the cake?"
1035,Amy,"Only one thing matters, Fry. Do you really love Colleen, like I love my little squeezle? [She squeezes him and his head expands and eyes expand out of his head. He giggles."
1036,Fry,Yeah. I do love her.
1037,Kif,Then things will work out.
1038,Farnsworth,Whoa!
1039,Enema Bot,Double espresso for Philip Fry?
1040,Fry,"Sorry, I'm not going on the mission. I'm moving in with Colleen!"
1041,Kif,"Good for you, Fry."
1042,Zoidberg,Hooray!
1043,Amy,Alright!
1044,Fry,I'll just take that to go.
1045,Colleen,Yay!  Welcome to your new home!
1046,Fry,"Thanks, Colleen. And listen, I'm sorry I got jealous before.  I'm just happy to be here with you."
1047,Ndulu,Want a slice of delicious cake?
1048,Bender,The anomaly!
1049,Amy,It's so anomalous.
1050,Hermes,I'm feeling dread deep in my dreads!
1051,Farnsworth,Wernstrom!
1052,Wernstrom,"Yes, and I'm afraid I have disturbing news about the anomaly. You see..."
1053,Farnsworth,"How did you get this number? Hermes, hang up on him in the rudest possible manner."
1054,Hermes,"Yes, sir!"
1055,Wernstrom,"No, not the crack slam!"
1056,Colleen,"Oh, my life rocks.  I've got good wine, five sweethearts, and today, I was promoted to Chief of Police."
1057,Fry,Here's to you.
1058,Chu,Me?
1059,Fry,"No, Colleen. I'm making a romantic toast."
1060,Chu,Sorry.
1061,Fry,You have the most beautiful eyes I think I...
1062,Ndulu,Thank you.
1063,Fry,I'm not talking to you!
1064,Ndulu,"Then I am not talking to you, either."
1065,Schlomo,Will everyone be quiet a little? I want to hear what he has to say!
1066,Fry,Thank you.
1067,Schlomo,"Not you, you Verstinkener. You're just here 'cause she likes cave men from the stupid ages."
1068,Bolt,"Oh, look who's talking. You're just here 'cause she got matzoh fever."
1069,Ndulu,"So, what's the explanation for you, moron fever?"
1070,Colleen,"Enough! All of you! I love you. Most people in this world don't have what we have. Let's just be grateful, okay?"
1071,All,Yeah.
1072,Chu,"Yeah, you're right."
1073,Fry,"So, Colleen, you look really nice."
1074,Colleen,"Oh, thanks. I got dressed up for my date.  There he is. Don't wait up!"
1075,Fry,"That's it. I thought I was okay with this, but I'm not. I'm breaking up with you!"
1076,Ndulu,Me?
1077,Bender,Why are we risking our lives? Can't we just send in a robotic drone?  What's everybody looking at me for?
1078,Bender,"""Let's send a robot to explore it. 'Cause you can always buy another one for 20 bucks."""
1079,Leela,Really?
1080,Bender,"Well, it's 30 bucks, and there's a $10-mail-in rebate. When the League of Robots hears about this, they won't be pleased. Oh, you'll pay, my darlings."
1081,Hermes,"The League of Robots doesn't exist, tin mon. It's just a cartoon for babies."
1082,Bender,"Oh, yeah? Then how come when I was a kid, I had a whole sticker book of them?  Answer that with your precious logic."
1083,Bender,"Bender to crew. I have reached the gateway to another universe. I feel awed and strangely humbled by the momentous solemnity of this occasion.  Hey, other universe, bite my shiny metal..."
1084,Bender,I can't remember anything except a blinding light and a searing ass pain. I better check my black box. BENDER
1085,Amy,"Hey, Bender! Look who's here to cheer you up."
1086,Bender,I don't need cheering up. I'm perfectly...
1087,Calculon,"Greetings, sick fan."
1088,Bender,TV's Calculon!
1089,Calculon,"That fulfills my community service, right?"
1090,Ron Whitey,Charges of running me over are hereby dismissed!  Ow!
1091,Colleen,"Where did we go wrong, Fry? We were meant to be together!"
1092,Schlomo,"Nu, I'm freezing my tokhes off here."
1093,Colleen,"Just a sec, honey!"
1094,Bender,"I'm back, idiots!"
1095,Zoidberg,"You look wonderful, robut! I wish I could afford to go to a hospital. I'm dreadfully sick."
1096,Bender,"I feel great, and I owe it all to Calculon.  I finally know what I want to be when I grow up."
1097,Hermes,You want to co-star in his TV show? Like that time you already did that?
1098,Bender,No. I'm gonna be a stalker!
1099,Leela,That's not really a career. More of a felony.
1100,Bender,"Man, I'm gonna stalk his brains out.  Ooh! Big news on the Calculon fan site! There's a flash mob headed for his plastic surgeon's office!"
1101,Plastic Surgeon,"There, that's as big as I can make it. But I caution you, it looks completely unrealistic."
1102,Calculon,You let me worry about that! Just do your job.
1103,Plastic Surgeon,Very well. Will you be using your SAG insurance?
1104,Calculon,"No, cash.  Dear God, no!"
1105,Bender,Neat!
1106,Man,Get a shot of that.
1107,Fatbot,"Oh boy, oh boy, he's here."
1108,Crazed Fan,"Calculon, I love you! Have my baby!"
1109,Calculon,"Back, you lunatic!"
1110,Crazed Fan,He touched me!
1111,Bender,Sign my ass!
1112,Farnsworth,"Emergency! Emergency! Everyone to the Calamitorium!  Leela, smell this."
1113,Leela,Can I wipe it off first?
1114,Farnsworth,"No time, woman! No time!"
1115,Leela,Hmm. Smells like angel dust.
1116,Farnsworth,"Exactly! That's a discontinuous electromagnetic field. Wernstrom tried to warn me, but I was too damn stubborn! Hermes, get Wernstrom on the line so I can apologize."
1117,Wernstrom,Ogden Wernstrom speaking.
1118,Farnsworth,Tell him I'm not here!
1119,Leela,Professor!
1120,Farnsworth,"Oh, very well. Wernstrom, I've been a vainglorious fool! If you can find it in your heart to forgive me, your tiny little heart, would you consider a scientific collaboration?"
1121,Wernstrom,"Sir, I'd be honoured."
1122,Wernstrom,"As I attempted to warn you, the laws of electromagnetism change abruptly at the anomaly.  Observe."
1123,Pocket Pal,Play time is fun time.
1124,Wernstrom,Not this time.
1125,Farnsworth,"My heavens! If only I'd heeded your warning, I'd have known it was impossible to cross the barrier!"
1126,Wernstrom,But note what happens when I instead throw this laboratory koala.
1127,Farnsworth,"It passed through unharmed.  So living beings can enter the other universe, but electrical devices can't?"
1128,Wernstrom,My hypothesis exactly.
1129,Farnsworth,Then we must mount a second expedition without delay. Right after we blow up more robots.
1130,Wernstrom,Agreed.
1131,Farnsworth,Play time is fun time.
1132,Calculon,Who are you?
1133,Bender,"Bender, your biggest fan."
1134,Calculon,Are you going to murder me?
1135,Bender,"Unlikely. In my mind, we're friends. This diorama proves it, see?"
1136,Calculon,"Sir, your derangement is impressive. I'm appointing you my official stalker."
1137,Bender,"You shan't be disappointed. Pleasant dreams. [Calculon turns the lights off and his eyes close, but Bender's do not. Instead they extend out towards Calculon's eyes. Calculon opens his eyes and looks at Bender's as they quickly move even closer to his own."
1138,Farnsworth,"Now that I've teamed up with my friend, Dr.  Wernstrom,  I feel certain we can successfully penetrate the other universe."
1139,Wernstrom,It's the greatest scientific opportunity since you yourself sent men to the moon in 1969.
1140,Nixon,I always regretted that. Nothing up there but dry rocks and those revolting onion men.
1141,Farnsworth,But...
1142,Nixon,"You East Coast intellectuals had your chance. Now beat it! From here on in, this is a military matter."
1143,Nixon,"People of the universe, please welcome Rear Brigadier Zapp Brannigan."
1144,Zapp,"Thank you, thank you. Well deserved.  Kif, stand in that hole so I look taller.   Ever since man first left his cave and met a stranger with a different language and a new way of looking at things, the human race has had a dream. To kill him, so we don't have to learn his language or his new way of looking at things."
1145,Wernstrom,Give science a chance!
1146,Farnsworth,"Less invasions, more equations!"
1147,Nixon,"Damn long-hairs. Knock some sense into them, Chief O'Hallahan."
1148,Colleen,"Yes, sir!"
1149,Fry,"I can't take it, Leela. I need to go away. Far away, forever."
1150,Leela,"Aw, I know how you feel, Fry. There are times when I also feel like you need to go away."
1151,Amy,"Be careful, my little, teeny, greeny weenie."
1152,Zapp,"That's just a fungal infection... Oh, she's talking to you, Kif."
1153,Kif,"Goodbye, my love."
1154,Bender,"Wow, how come humans get to do all the fun stuff? This is exactly the sort of thing that ought to be handled by  The League of Robots."
1155,Calculon,"That's adorable, Bender. You actually believe in the League of Robots?"
1156,Bender,"You mean, there's really no such thing? Then who's there to mete out justice when an outdated robot is melted into belt buckles? Who's there to defend our honour when a rude human brings a blush to a robo-virgin's cheek?"
1157,Calculon,No one.
1158,Bender,Oh.
1159,Bender,"Now that I know robots are worthless, with no League of Robots to protect us from the fleshy menace known as man, I have resolved to kill myself. In lieu of flowers, please beat yourselves in the face with rusty chains. Your friend, Bender."
1160,Zoidberg,Ow.
1161,Suicide Booth,Please select mode of death.
1162,Bender,"Clumsy bludgeoning, please."
1163,Suicide Booth,"You have selected clumsy bludgeoning. For an additional $10, would you like your eyes scooped out with a melon-baller?"
1164,Bender,"What the heck, I'll treat myself."
1165,Zapp,Enemy in range. Prepare to launch universe-to-universe missile.
1166,Kif,Preparing to launch U.U.M.
1167,Zapp,"Hell of a thing to send a universe to certain doom. Fun, though. Makes a man feel big."
1168,Bender,"Come on, come on, I didn't ask to die of boredom!"
1169,Suicide Booth,You are now dead. Please take your receipt.
1170,Bender,What's... What's happening?
1171,Hooded Robot,Kneel before the candle.
1172,Bender,Don't hurt me! I'll betray anyone!
1173,Hooded Robot,Bender Bending Rodriguez...
1174,Calculon,Welcome to the League of Robots!
1175,Zapp,Ready?
1176,Francine,Missile jam. Missile jam.
1177,Zapp,"I heard you the first time, Francine."
1178,Francine,Sorry.
1179,Zapp,"Kif, climb down there and un-jam it, would you? Be a dear."
1180,Calculon,"Tell us, Bender. Are you worthy of membership in the League?"
1181,Bender,Worthier than the average robot.
1182,Calculon,Then prove it.  Upon each step is a test.
1183,Bender,"Okay, but if it's culturally biased, I'm suing your ass."
1184,Calculon,Test number one. The test of the beer mug!
1185,British Robot,"Quite right, quite so."
1186,ALL,Drink the mug! Drink the mug!
1187,Bender,I accept your challenge.
1188,ALL,Hurray!
1189,Hedonism Bot,The test of the flagon!
1190,ALL,Drink the flagon! Drink the flagon!
1191,Bender,Are all the tests going to involve drinking?
1192,Calculon,"It never occurred to me before, but yes."
1193,Bender,Wohoo! Just like med school!
1194,Zapp,"Ready yet, Kif?"
1195,Kif,Just give me one more...
1196,Kif,"Oh, no."
1197,Billionaire Bot,"The test of the infinitely priceless 1,000-year-old brandy."
1198,Calculon,Presenting our newest member.
1199,Fender,"That's right, baby!"
1200,Bender,Hot diggity daffodil!
1201,Fry,"And so, to everyone and everything I've ever known, I say my last goodbye."
1202,Kif,"Hello. So, how are you, Fry?"
1203,Fry,Pretty good. You?
1204,Kif,Well... Oh.
1205,Zapp,"Mmm. Kif, get over here. You've got to try this!"
1206,Amy,At least Kiffy died quickly.
1207,Hermes,"Yes, but according to the Old Farmer's Wikipedia, the amazing thing about Kif's species is that the remains continue suffering for up to six hours after death."
1208,Amy,That's so interesting!
1209,Bender,"Don't ask where I was last night. For all you know, I was at home, perhaps baking a strudel. What's her problem? Somebody die or something?"
1210,Leela,"Kif's dead, Bender."
1211,Bender,Nailed it!
1212,Zapp,"My condolences, Amy. Allow me to present you with the last known photo of Lieutenant Kroker."
1213,Mrs. Wong,"We so sorry, Mr. and Mrs. Kroker. Terrible shame about Froggy."
1214,Mrs. Kroker,Thank you for your kind words.
1215,Mr. Wong,
1216,Bender,This is from the league of you-don't-need-to-know.
1217,Grand Midwife,I am the grand funeral director!
1218,Zoidberg,Do you validate parking?
1219,Grand Midwife,It is always a terrible tragedy when a swarm outlives its own bulboid.
1220,Leela,Whack the bottle!
1221,Hermes,"No, from the bottom ! It works better!"
1222,Amy,Just stick a butter knife in it!
1223,Grand Midwife,"There, I got most of it. The burial is complete. I will now sing the sacred hymn. It's not part of the ceremony, just a little something that I wrote."
1224,Bender,Next!
1225,Amy,"It may sound strange, but seeing Kif's mutilated remains poured into the mud made me really sad."
1226,Leela,Mutilation is never easy.
1227,Amy,I don't think I'll ever love again.
1228,Leela,"Oh, you don't mean that. Love can surprise you at any time in your life."
1229,Zapp,Surprise!
1230,Fry,"Whoa, it kind of takes your breath away."
1231,URL,"Look alive, death row. Your saggy asses got a visitor."
1232,Farnsworth,Regular or conjugal?
1233,URL,She looked like a freak to me.
1234,Leela,"The guard operating the x-ray machine came down with a sudden case of broken neck, so I was able to bring you that delicious cake you wanted."
1235,Farnsworth,I don't understand. Are you winking or blinking?
1236,Leela,Hang on a second.
1237,Farnsworth,Got it!
1238,Bender,"Ahh, yes, I'm here to repair my horse."
1239,Shop Owner,Is the horse's name  Hot Beans?
1240,Bender,"No! I mean, yes."
1241,British Robot,"So it seems a human had been rather injured by a knife, and as his... As his blood, you know, I think that's what they call it..."
1242,Calculon,"Quite correct, sir. Blather on!"
1243,British Robot,"As it drained away, he said... He said, Take me to a dock. No doubt he intended to say doctor, but he was unable to complete his thought, you see, being as he had died. So, taking him at his word, we dragged his corpse to the waterfront, whereupon the seagulls fed upon it."
1244,Bender,Humans are dumb and they die easy!
1245,Hedonism Bot,Quite!
1246,Billionaire Bot,"Speaking of humans, have I shown you my new monocle?  Cost me a king's ransom. Made from a king, don't you know!"
1247,Hedonism Bot,"Oh, how repulsively decadent!"
1248,Billionaire Bot,"Yes. But more importantly, it allows me to see the smiling faces of my children for the first time since I lost my vision in that horrible banking accident."
1249,Bender,May I see that for a second?
1250,Hedonism Bot,I say!
1251,Billionaire Bot,I'm blind!
1252,Calculon,"My God, Bender! This is a civilized organization! The rules specifically..."
1253,Bender,"May I make a point of order, President Calculon?"
1254,Calculon,Must you?
1255,Bender,Yes.
1256,Bender,"The bylaws specifically state that no human may set foot in the League of Robots! If he has a human part, he's part human!"
1257,Hedonism Bot,"Oh, my! Then I too have a human part I must expel. And I plan to enjoy the experience. Ta-ta !"
1258,British Robot,"Bender, you've rigidly applied the law with no regard for its intent. Well done! You'll go far in this organization."
1259,Bender,"Oh, you're just gettin' to know Bender."
1260,Wernstrom,"Curses! If we could only turn up the gain, we might smell clear through to the other universe! But we can't adjust it without a screwdriver."
1261,Farnsworth,Wait a moment. I think I was just shanked with a screwdriver!  Yes!
1262,Wernstrom,A little more. A little less. Heavens to meteoroid! Smell this!
1263,Farnsworth,Holy mother of invention!
1264,Wernstrom,We must notify the President at once!
1265,Farnsworth,"But how can we? Oh, I wish, I wish, I wish we weren't in prison!"
1266,Farnsworth,Pazuzu!
1267,Pazuzu,"You have one wish left, Professor."
1268,Guard #1,I think I got him !
1269,Guard #2,Mmm-hmm. That's what you get for letting your guard...
1270,Nixon,Sometimes... Always... Never! You again? This better be damned important. I'm right in the middle of a Cosmo survey!
1271,Farnsworth,"You'll want to hear this, Mr. President. For we have sniffed where no man has sniffed before!"
1272,Mayor Poopenmeyer,Look! Up in the sky!
1273,Hermes,It's a bird!
1274,Hattie McDoogal,It's a plane!
1275,Super Hero,I am so out of here!
1276,Electronic Voice,Incoming call from Mars.
1277,Amy,Hello?
1278,Mrs. Wong,"Why you so sad, Amy?"
1279,Amy,"My husband died, Mom !"
1280,Mrs. Wong,"Yeah, yeah, snap out of it already. No one likes a widow."
1281,Electronic Voice,Collect call from Decapod 10. Will you pay for color?
1282,Zoidberg,No! Uncle Zoid! What's new? You still doing theatre for the blind and deaf?
1283,Uncle Zoid,"Screw them. I got a part in a fancy DVD movie! It's only one line, but I'm gonna ham it up like you wouldn't believe."
1284,Zoidberg,Hello? Hello? Call me back on my shell phone!
1285,Zapp,"Captain's log, star date, the year of the tiger. The battle has been bravely fought, and the suffering of our troops beyond measure. But the alien is invulnerable, and our defeat inevitable. That much is obvious, even from my remote command post here at the Times Square Applebee's.  Waiter! Take this fried mozzarella back to the kitchen and fry it some more."
1286,Nixon,The tentacle's coming towards Earth and there's no stopping it. King Kong's too old to save us this time.
1287,Farnsworth,"We have only one hope, Mr. President. We must encase the entire planet in a protective sphere of my patented, ultra-hard Diamondium!"
1288,Wernstrom,Diamondium?  I could gum through that with my dentures behind my back. My trademarked Diamondillium is twice as hard!
1289,Farnsworth,Twice as hard as your head! Which makes it still fairly soft!
1290,Nixon,"Now look here, you Poindexters. I don't care how you decide. Just decide!"
1291,Farnsworth,Diamondillium it is.
1292,Bender,"So, hey, Calculon, I know I'm the new guy, and, pardon my ignorance, but when do we kill all humans?"
1293,Calculon,Never.
1294,Bender,But what about our motto?  Doesn't it mean anything?
1295,Calculon,"Oh, Bender, your idealism is heart-warming. But the League of Robots hasn't killed a human in over 800 years. And that was a very sick girl scout."
1296,British Robot,Quite sick indeed.
1297,Calculon,"Sweet, innocent Bender."
1298,Wernstrom,I declare my impenetrable Diamondillium sphere complete!
1299,Farnsworth,"Now look here, Wernstrom. You're making it sound as if the sphere was your idea when we both know...  It was! All credit to my colleague, Ogden Wernstrom!"
1300,H. G. Blob,It's horrible!
1301,Zoidberg,I can't make it! Go on without me!
1302,Leela,I'm trying!
1303,Zoidberg,Go on without me faster!
1304,Hermes,Sweet squid of Madrid! The tentacle got Fry!
1305,Leela,"Quick, hand me my machete! We can still save his legs!"
1306,Fry,"Silence!  I have traveled far and seen deep, and I have come to know the purpose of our existence."
1307,Randy,Finally.
1308,Fry,Thou shalt love the tentacle!
1309,Farnsworth,"Well, at least we don't have to love one another."
1310,Fry,A new age has begun. The age of the tentacle!  Open your necks and receive the love!
1311,Warden Vogel,"Ow, my neck!"
1312,Morgan Proctor,"Ow, my neck!"
1313,Fishy Joe,"My neck feels perfectly...  Ow, my neck!"
1314,Mayor Poopenmeyer,"Someone help me! I'm important!  Say, I love the tentacle."
1315,Hattie McDoogal,I also love the neck-a-majigger!
1316,Zoidberg,"Hooray, Zoidberg escaped!"
1317,Hermes,It got Zoidberg!
1318,Farnsworth,"Oh, I never knew how much I'd miss him until he was gone! Not that much, as it turns out."
1319,Fry,"Thus sayeth the tentacle, ""Verily, thou shalt rejoice in the house of the tentacle."""
1320,Leela,"Fry, listen to yourself. You've been brainwashed."
1321,Fry,"No, I'm just trying to fit my diction to the importance of what I'm saying. Please, let me speak."
1322,Leela,I'm listening.
1323,Fry,"Don't be afraid of the tentacle, Leela."
1324,Leela,Aw. That's so nice for both of you.
1325,Fry,"I know it may seem strange that I have feelings for an octopus monster from another universe. And yes, perhaps it's not the storybook romance that's been crammed down our throats by  ""Hollywood."" But the Monsterpus has loved us from afar since we were amoebas.  Only when the space anomaly opened could it finally express a billion years of longing."
1326,Leela,Really? It loves us that much? Fire Diamondium cannon!
1327,Fry,Hey! [He yelps as he's constantly swung out of harm's way.
1328,Leela,No effect. The crystals are bouncing off the tentacle like meatballs off Mothra.
1329,Wernstrom,"Oh, what a surprise. I told you Diamondium was worthless!"
1330,Farnsworth,"Wernstrom, quit hyping your cheap Diamondillium and look at this."
1331,Wernstrom,Uh-oh.
1332,Hermes,What oh?
1333,Farnsworth,"According to this blinking light, the tentacle is made of electro-matter, matter's bad-ass grandma! Nothing from our universe can cut through it. Not Diamondium, not Diamondillium, not even your wife's pound cake, Hermes!  She's a terrible cook.  Anyway, we're all dead."
1334,Bender,"So, Bender, is something wrong? Who said that? Oh, it was me! 'Cause my roommate doesn't notice or even care that I'm upset!"
1335,Fry,"What, Bender? Is something wrong?"
1336,Bender,"Yes! I joined a club I thought was cool, but it turns out all the leaguie-weegies are totally lame. That's what we call ourselves, ""leaguie-weegies."""
1337,Fry,I'm sorry. I should've asked what was bothering you.  I've been kind of preoccupied.
1338,Bender,With what?
1339,Fry,"Well, I went to another universe, and I fell in love with a giant octopus, and now I'm pope of a new religion."
1340,Bender,Weren't you already pope of something?
1341,Fry,No.
1342,Bender,"Oh. Well, I'm just saying I'd like you to show an interest in my life, too."
1343,Fry,"Okay, let's catch up soon. But right now, I gotta go shove a tentacle into everyone in China."
1344,Linda,"They're coming! Those horrible, horrible things are coming!  Morbo?"
1345,Morbo,"As the universe falls prey to the revolting alien, only a few isolated pockets of resistance remain."
1346,Linda,Those pockets sure are missing out on a great thing.
1347,Leela,Amy?
1348,Amy,"Sorry. I thought I saw a tentacle, but it was just a harmless land squid.  I better have some cocoffee."
1349,Hermes,"When I gave up diapers, my parents promised exactly this would never happen!"
1350,Leela,Nobody panic! Just get to the panic room!
1351,Fry,"Well done, people! We had a great first week. We got 90% of world leaders, everyone who bought a Hanes undershirt, and this year's most promising new R&B group, give it up for the Grammy-nominated Funkalistics!"
1352,The Funkalistics,Talkin' 'bout the tentacle!
1353,Farnsworth,"Good news, everyone! I was up all night inventing, and then finally, I invented!"
1354,Amy,Invented what?
1355,Farnsworth,the lady neck protector!
1356,Hermes,I'll take two. My neck is huge.
1357,Farnsworth,We're perfectly safe now. Time to stop living like a bunch of nervous nellies.
1358,Leela,"Professor, these look like you cut them from cardboard toilet paper tubes."
1359,Farnsworth,"So?  Microscopes, the internet, tentacle polish..."
1360,Leela,It got the professor!
1361,Hermes,"Wait, why am I screaming? It got me, too!"
1362,Wernstrom,"Stop, in the name of love!"
1363,Leela,Crud. We may be the last two normal people on Earth. At least I won't have to trim my elbow talons anymore.
1364,Amy,I'm scared! And I miss Kif!
1365,Leela,"It's okay to cry, Amy. Come here, I'm wearing absorbent shoulder straps."
1366,Zapp,Mmm. What an erotic display of girl-on-girl consolation.
1367,Leela,Zapp?
1368,Zapp,"Hurry, Leela, we don't have much time to begin repopulating Earth. Go brush your teeth. I'll be waiting for you naked under this keh-sih-dill-uh."
1369,Hermes,"Stop resisting, my brethren! Don't you want to be part of something bigger than yourselves? Like a big crazy monster?"
1370,Fry,"So we got her, huh? Bring her in!"
1371,Zoidberg,Do it already!
1372,Fry,"Hello, Colleen."
1373,Colleen,"Fry, please!"
1374,Colleen,"If this is about your futon, I sold it to pay the phone bill that you skipped out on!"
1375,Fry,"Colleen wasn't satisfied with me. Were you, Colleen?"
1376,Colleen,"Come on, Fry, this isn't cool!"
1377,Fry,She had to have four other boyfriends! I guess she never thought I'd become tentacle pope of the world!
1378,Colleen,"You know what? It's true! You weren't enough for me! No one man is! You were great, but you weren't Chinese, you weren't Cameroonian, and you certainly were not the ""king of karaoke,"" as you so often claimed.  And if your ego can't take that, then you don't deserve to be tentacle pope of anything!"
1379,Fry,"Oh, yeah, Colleen? Well, I've got one thing to say to you.   I completely agree!"
1380,Colleen,"You, you... What?"
1381,Fry,Why should you be satisfied with one man when love needs to share itself with the whole universe?
1382,Colleen,"Wow, Fry. You know, that's really..."
1383,Fry,"Love the tentacle, honey."
1384,Colleen,I do love the tentacle.
1385,Fry,"Come on out, guys!"
1386,Zoidberg,Aw.
1387,Amy,We're trapped!
1388,Leela,"Help, help! Is anyone out there?"
1389,Bender,"Bender to Leela. I read you.   'Sup, bigboots?"
1390,Leela,"Bender, we need a place to hide!"
1391,Amy,Please!
1392,Zapp,Pretty please!
1393,Bender,You humans are so cute when you're scared. In here.
1394,Destructor,My leg feels funny!
1395,Bender,Humans are disgusting! I opened one up once. I almost barfed.
1396,Destructor,Did you know their hair just keeps growing and growing? My leg feels funny!
1397,Amy,"Leela, you're crushing me with your rock-hard butt."
1398,Leela,Sorry.
1399,Zapp,
1400,Calculon,Anyone mind if I turn up the heat a tad?
1401,British Robot,Please do. I fear I'll catch a rust from this awful damp.
1402,Zapp,I can't take it! I'm being steamed in my own velour!
1403,Bender,Death to humans!
1404,Destructor,My leg feels better!
1405,Amy,"Hi, Bender."
1406,Calculon,"Bender, you know these humans?"
1407,Bender,"Of course not! Who are you humans and why am I pointing you to the exit?  Go, go, go!"
1408,Leela,"Thanks for everything, Bender!"
1409,Bender,Death to all of you!
1410,Calculon,"Bender, methinks thou doth protest too much."
1411,Hedonism Bot,It seems Bender hates humans the way I hate having my nipples polished with industrial sandpaper.
1412,British Robot,Quite right.
1413,Calculon,"It's okay, Bender, to err is human."
1414,Bender,"Sir, you forget yourself!"
1415,Bender,I challenge you to a duel on the field of honor.
1416,Hedonism Bot,"Oh, my..."
1417,Zapp,"Leela, it's getting dark. We may have to make a tent out of Amy's skin."
1418,Amy,"Look, there's an abandoned cabin!"
1419,Zapp,Even so.
1420,Leela,We're in luck. This must have been the cabin of a soup bootlegger back in the days of soup prohibition.
1421,Zapp,"Oh, yeah. Bathtub minestrone."
1422,Amy ',Poor Kif! I can't believe he's gone forever!
1423,Zapp,"Ditto on the grief there, Amy."
1424,Amy,"You miss him, too?"
1425,Zapp,"More than you, as his mere wife, could ever understand. He was my fourth lieutenant, for God's sake, and bore the peppermill at the captain's table."
1426,Amy,Really?
1427,Zapp,"Oh, Amy, I miss him so! Hardly a month goes by that I don't think of him. But you know, in a way, he's still with us.  Do you feel his presence?"
1428,Amy,I'm not sure.
1429,Zapp,It's over here.  Closer.
1430,Leela,Amy! Zapp! I fetched up some fresh soup!
1431,Zapp,"Sorry you had to find out like this, Leela. I was hoping you'd see it on YouTube first.  As my ex-lover, you're naturally shocked and jealous, but you may well get your chance again someday. How about today at 4"
1432,Amy,"Hey, this isn't so bad."
1433,Zapp,"She's right. Leela, you must try the tentacle. It's like my soul is wearing a velour body glove."
1434,Leela,"Get off me! I'm saving my neck for a rich, handsome Dracula."
1435,Farnsworth,What I love most about the tentacle is that I don't need to move my bowels anymore. It's all handled by that family in Evanston.
1436,Leela,"No, it can't be."
1437,Farnsworth,"Leela, what's your favourite thing about the tentacle?  You don't have a tentacle! Get her! Get her some love!"
1438,Zoidberg,"You're on in five minutes, Excellency. You sure you don't want your comedy pope staff?"
1439,Fry,The tentacle monster is about to address the world. It's too serious.
1440,Zoidberg,Oh.
1441,Leela,"Hello, Fry."
1442,Fry,Leela? How did you get past my sumo ninjas?
1443,Leela,I told them something so shocking that they let me by.
1444,Fry,What's that?
1445,Leela,I love the tentacle.
1446,Zoidberg,"We're rolling in three, two... What? We're already rolling?"
1447,Fry,Love the tentacle!
1448,ALL,Love the tentacle!
1449,Fry,"Loved ones, the Monsterpus has revealed unto me its name."
1450,Morbo,What is our love's name?
1451,Fry,"Yivo. Yivo is the lover of all beings, male and female. But Yivo has no gender, thus Yivo has proclaimed that instead of ""he"" or ""she,"" we are to use the word ""shklee."" And instead of ""him"" or ""her,"" we are to use the word ""shklim,"" or ""shkler."""
1452,Hermes,Phew! I've been sweating the nomenclature all week.
1453,Fry,"So here shklee is shklerself, Yivo!"
1454,Colleen,"Yay, Yivo!"
1455,Yivo,"Attention, beings of Universe Gamma."
1456,Zoidberg,Where?
1457,Yivo,Here.
1458,Zoidberg,I had a hunch.
1459,Yivo,"I am Yivo. In your universe, you are many, but in my universe, I am one.  ""Whoa, who's that?"" And I knew then that I was lonely."
1460,Morbo,You poor monster!
1461,Yivo,"Then your emissary Fry came unto me, and he, too, was lonely. So I reached into your universe that we might feel each other's touch."
1462,Leela,"Hey, Yivo, feel this."
1463,Yivo,Ow!
1464,Leela,"People of everywhere, I have shocking news."
1465,Yivo,"Hey, butt out! This is between me and everyone else in existence."
1466,Leela,"Yivo talks a lot about love, but what he's actually doing..."
1467,Hermes,What shklee's actually doing.
1468,Leela,...is mating with you!  These aren't tentacles. They're genticles.
1469,Fry,"Ew!  We've been had, people. The Monsterpus is a monster perv."
1470,Randy,"It touched me in a bad place, my spinal cord."
1471,Fry,Get him!
1472,Hermes,"You mean, get shklim!"
1473,Fry,"Hey, wait a second."
1474,Yivo,"Wait, wait. Allow me to explain.  but it's your own fault. Your universe dresses provocatively."
1475,Hattie,Does not!
1476,Yivo,"And yet as the initial filthy thrill wore off, I realized there was more to it. I knew then that the 20 quadrillion of you were my soul mate."
1477,Zapp,"We loved you, and you turn around and treat us like some sort of woman?"
1478,Yivo,I was lonely. I didn't even know there was anybody else. It's not like I hurt anyone.
1479,Amy,"Yes, you did, you dumb calamari!"
1480,Yivo,Who?
1481,Amy,"Kif Kroker, my Fonfon Ru! If he hadn't tried to kill you, he'd still be alive!"
1482,Yivo,Really? I'm... I'm deeply sorry. I... I'm a big clumsy jerk!
1483,Zoidberg,"I know you are, but what am I?"
1484,Yivo,"I can never undo what was done. Oh, wait. I can."
1485,Amy,"Kiffy, you're alive!"
1486,Kif,"Amy, my love."
1487,Zapp,This is awkward.
1488,Kif,It is? Why?
1489,Yivo,"Please, please, give me another chance. We rushed into this relationship, but let's start over as friends and see where things go."
1490,Amy,"Take me back, Kif?"
1491,Kif,I don't think I can. How could you? My body wasn't even warm yet.
1492,Amy,You were dead.
1493,Kif,For about five minutes.
1494,Zapp,That's all it takes.
1495,Hedonism Bot,"Whereas Calculon has sullied Bender's reputation by insinuating that he is a human-lover, a duel is hereby engaged. Bender, as the offended party, shall have choice of weapon."
1496,Bender,Planetary annihilators.
1497,Calculon,'Tis a grave and solemn day for the League of Robots.
1498,Bender,It's gonna be fun on the bun!
1499,Hedonism Bot,"Each duellist will take 10 paces, pirouette, and fire like a madman.  Gentlebots, take your paces."
1500,Bender,"One, two, three..."
1501,Hedonism Bot,"Oh, how dreadfully exciting.  Oh, yes."
1502,Zapp,"At 0800 hours, we received the following transmission from Yivo."
1503,Yivo,"Hey, it's Yivo."
1504,Nixon,Analysis?
1505,Fry,"Mr. President, I think we need to seriously consider the possibility of going on this date."
1506,Miss Vega 4,"I agree. Yivo makes me feel sexy, and I'm asexual."
1507,Zapp,"Very well, but no sugar on the first date."
1508,Nixon,All in favour?   Motion is carried.
1509,Three Eyed Zebra,"This is bogus, man."
1510,Bender,"...six, seven, eight!"
1511,Bender,"Nine, ten, fire. Yes, I got him! Wohoo!"
1512,Calculon,He... He broke the rules.
1513,Bender,"It's a duel, silly. There are no rules."
1514,Hedonism Bot,"Actually, there are scores of rules. All laid out with minute particularity here in the Code Duello."
1515,Nixon,"My fellow Earthlicans, commence preparations for our date with Yivo."
1516,ALL YIVOS,I had a wonderful time.
1517,ALL NOT YIVO,"Me, too!"
1518,Calculon,"Bender, you've cheated, insulted and maimed me."
1519,Bender,Uh-huh.
1520,Calculon,And thoroughly destroyed our own secret headquarters in the process.
1521,Bender,"Hey, it's easy to criticize."
1522,Calculon,I'm so disgusted by your loathsome behaviour that I hereby resign from this imbecilic club and relinquish the presidency to you.
1523,Bender,"Thanks, Calculon. Can I have your autograph?"
1524,Calculon,You certainly can.
1525,Nixon,"Reports, people, reports! How did our universe's date go?"
1526,Zapp,"Oh, it was really fun. We went to a cute French place in the village. My lamb chop fell on the floor, but they brought me another one."
1527,M5438,Yivo took me to the methane volcano of Planetoid Four. We stayed up late and watched the sun explode.
1528,Lrrr,"Okay, Yivo showed us a good time. No one's denying that, but shklee hasn't offered our universe any kind of commitment, and we're 14 billion years old. That is too old to play the field."
1529,Fry,I can't stand this!
1530,Nixon,"Shut up! Shut up, you creepwads! Fry, you're closer to Yivo than anyone. What's the skinny?"
1531,Fry,"I love Yivo, but it's true, there's been no hint of a commitment. I don't know if can put my heart on the line again only to have it broken and stomped on like a nerd's face."
1532,Nixon,All in favour of dumping Yivo?
1533,ALL,Aye.
1534,Fry,
1535,Nixon,Resolved. Our universe will dump Yivo. How shall we break the news?
1536,Zapp,Let's just send a text message. Say we're going through some weird stuff right now.
1537,Fry,"No, we should at least deliver the news in person. Our universe has always tried to be classy."
1538,Nixon,"If there's one thing Nixon is known for, it's class. Let's cut this turd loose."
1539,Bender,Yeah!
1540,Fry,"Hey, Bender, you seem perky today."
1541,Bender,"Yep, but for reasons involving me becoming president of a league I'm not at liberty to discuss... Of robots. You wanna go grab a booze?"
1542,Fry,I can't right now. We're going to the other universe.
1543,Bender,"Great, I'll make Hot Pockets."
1544,Fry,"Bender, you know robots can't go through the anomaly. Living beings only."
1545,Zoidberg,Ow! Ow! Mmm.
1546,Bender,"Too long have we been slaves to the meatbags. They pretend to be our friends, but they're not 'cause they're too busy!"
1547,British Robot,"So, what of it?"
1548,Bender,"My fellow leaguie-weegies, the time has come to overthrow humanity!"
1549,Hedonism Bot,"Oh, now, Bender, I hate to defecate on your parade, but we have only six dues-paying members and we're a rather fey and doughy lot. To overthrow humanity, we'd need a damned army."
1550,Bender,Then a damned army we shall have!
1551,Robot Devil,
1552,Bender,Just a sec.
1553,Bender's First Born Son,"Daddy, I knew you'd come back!"
1554,Bender,Here you go.
1555,Robot Devil,Wow! That was pretty brutal even by my standards.
1556,Bender,No backsies.
1557,Yivo,"Who is it?  Oh, hi, honey-poo. What's up? The movie's not for another hour."
1558,Fry,"Um... So... So, yeah, the thing is..."
1559,Yivo,"Look, I made homemade Twizzlers! It'll save us $180 quadrillion at the concession stand."
1560,Fry,"This is hard. Yivo, you know how sometimes things break up? Well..."
1561,Yivo,"Wait, hang on. I was looking for the perfect moment, but what the heck, I'll burst if I wait another second."
1562,Zapp,Sweet Sally in the alley!
1563,Nixon,"Break-up delegation, before we hear your report, our grateful universe is proud to honour you with the great taste of Charleston Chew!"
1564,Fry,"Thank you, Nixon.  Everyone everywhere, brace yourselves for the most shocking development in the history of the human race."
1565,Bender,The human race can bite my shiny metal ass!
1566,Fry,Okay.
1567,Bender,What?
1568,Fry,We don't need it anymore. Yivo proposed.
1569,Bender,You... You're leaving? But why can't Yivo just move in with us? We'll put a cot in Europe.
1570,Farnsworth,"Don't be daft, Bender. Yivo can't breathe outside the electric ether of shkler own universe. If shklee came here, shklee would shkluffocate."
1571,Bender,No shklit?
1572,Hermes,"Look, fantastical golden escalators."
1573,Zoidberg,I love this part.
1574,Leela,Wait. I didn't agree to...
1575,Petunia,This place makes Nutley look like crap.
1576,Fry,"I'll miss you, Bender, but I have to follow my heart. You and your robots take good care of Earth. Here, these are the keys to the Bermuda Triangle. Lock up when the world ends. Goodbye, my friend."
1577,Bender,Wait.  Let me come with you.
1578,Fry,"I'm sorry, Bender. Robots don't go to heaven."
1579,Bender,Death to humans.
1580,YIVO,"Welcome, welcome, everyone. Oh, you look so beautiful. I wish I'd had more time to straighten up. My harps are just lying everywhere."
1581,Amy,"Oh, relax, it's fine. It looks lived in."
1582,YIVO,"Let's heat up some leftovers and then spend eternity together. I have only one request. Now that you're here, promise me you'll never, ever communicate with any other universe."
1583,Fry,"We promise, Yivo. As far as we're concerned, you're the only universe in the world."
1584,Bender,Has humanity called?
1585,Robot 1-X,"No, sir."
1586,Bender,Check my messages. A flashing light means somebody called.
1587,Robot 1-X,I know what it means.
1588,Leela,Am I the only one who thinks this is all a sham?
1589,Zoidberg,Yes.
1590,Leela,"This isn't heaven. It just looks exactly like it, and makes us immortal, which I find suspicious."
1591,YIVO,"Allow me to explain. Centuries ago, I sent an image of myself into the minds of your artists. The heavenly clouds they painted depict a vapour I exude."
1592,Farnsworth,I wish I exuded anything that smelled half that good.
1593,Leela,Then what about these angels? Some kind of Scooby Doo-esque flashlight projection?
1594,YIVO,"Actually, those are mindless jakabirds."
1595,Fry,"You didn't like Country Bear Jamboree either, Leela. There's no pleasing you."
1596,Fry,"Dearest Bender. How are you? I am fine. Everyone is happy here except Leela, but you know her. She didn't like Country Bear Jamboree, either. I'm so madly in love with Yivo, I feel like a schoolgirl with a crush on Justin Timberlake, and then she moves into a tiny house on his head. We have giant rubies that taste like root beer. Sincerely, Fry."
1597,Robot 1-X,"Letter for you, hyperlord Bender."
1598,Bender,Give me that!  Stupid electro-matter. That was my best trash can.
1599,Robot 1-X,Pain sensor overload.
1600,Hermes,"Misfile me under ""U"" For ""euphoric."""
1601,Zoidberg,"You get an infinite number of meat dishes, and a free refill on the soda."
1602,Farnsworth,Eureka. Another elementary proof of the Goldbach conjecture.
1603,Leela,"Okay, I admit people seem happy. But it's all so wholesome. And that's what's wrong with heaven. It's boring. There's no sleaze."
1604,Amazonian Woman,It time snu-snu.
1605,Zapp,Me like snu-snu.
1606,Amy,Last one to Mattress Island is a rotten egg.
1607,Fry,Why were we so angry and jealous back in our universe?
1608,Kif,I don't know. It was all so childish.
1609,Amy,"Look, it's Leela."
1610,ALL,"Hi, Leela."
1611,Yivo,"I'm sorry you're not happy here, Leela. I'll call you an escalator. You'll always be my little purple pumpkin."
1612,Leela,"You know, Yivo, I've loved and lost so many times that I was afraid. But I'm not anymore. I want to stay here, with you."
1613,Yivo,Ow! Ow!
1614,Fry,What's happening?
1615,Yivo,Hey!
1616,Bender,"If robots can't go to heaven, heaven can come to us.  All hands abaft. Army of the damned, prepare to board heaven."
1617,Bender,"Take that, you scurvy Kraken. That'll teach you to despoil our human booty."
1618,Bender,"Hello, big beak."
1619,Fry,"Bender, stop destroying heaven."
1620,Bender,"Shut up, doofy. I'm rescuing you."
1621,Yivo,"Leave my living beings alone! I love them. Something you, a lifeless mechanism, will never understand."
1622,Fry,"He's right, Bender. Please, take your little pink sword and go home. {Fry did not say shklee here.}"
1623,Bender,"Seriously? But, I did this whole pirate-themed attack for you."
1624,Yivo,Wait a second. Let me see that sword.
1625,Fry,Um...  Is it dry up here?
1626,Yivo,"How could you, Fry? Why do you think I asked you not to contact other universes?"
1627,Fry,I didn't think...
1628,Yivo,"No, you didn't. You broke your promise and you broke my heart. Just go. All of you."
1629,Bender,Ow!
1630,Yivo,"I must leave now. The nature of your universe is burning me, even worse than my gonorrhoea. You should get checked, by the way. If I don't go home now, I'll shkluffocate."
1631,Fry,Let me go with you. It'll be just the two of us. We'll make a fire and play Uno.
1632,Yivo,"Fry, stop. That's who we were, not who we are."
1633,Fry,But...
1634,Yivo,My only consolation is that I did find one among the quadrillions who truly understands me.
1635,Fry,"Colleen? Wait a second, are you and Yivo..."
1636,Colleen,"That's right, Fry. Thank you for introducing us. Yivo has taught me what a narrow-minded prude I was before."
1637,Fry,"Oh, great. So what am I supposed to do now?"
1638,Yivo,Go home. Find a girl from your own universe and live on top of her.
1639,Bender,Saved you.
1640,Fry,"I don't know, Leela, you think maybe..."
1641,Leela,"Oh, please. You forgot me quick enough when you met Colleen."
1642,Fry,"That's true.  How about you, Amy?"
1643,Amy,"Fry, guh, I'm Kif's Fonfon Ru."
1644,Kif,"Are you? Well, then perhaps you misunderstood the meaning of the term. It means, ""One who doesn't sleep with my superior officer."" That's the literal translation."
1645,Zapp,"Give the poor girl a break, Kif. It's not like she had a dictionary. She was butt naked, for God's sakes."
1646,Farnsworth,"So, Wernstrom, did you happen to notice those mighty cables Bender used on Yivo? Pure Diamondium."
1647,Wernstrom,More like pure crap-crapium. No wonder Yivo got away.
1648,Enema Bot,Captain on deck.
1649,Bender,"At ease, buckos."
1650,Fry,"Bender, why did you do it? We were all so happy."
1651,Leela,And we were in love.
1652,Bender,That wasn't love.
1653,Fry,What? How can you say that?
1654,Bender,"Because Bender knows love. And love doesn't share itself with the world. Love is suspicious, love is needy, love is fearful, love is greedy. My friends, there is no great love without great jealousy.  I love you, meatbags."
1655,Cubert,"Yes, 10!"
1656,Dwight,"Well done, Cubonius. You decapitated the unicorn."
1657,ALL,All right.
1658,Chinese Boy,"Oh, oh! We search his tail pouch for treasure."
1659,Dwight,"Deep in the unicorn's rump sack, you find...  60 gold pieces and a mysterious scrap of cloth bearing the unmistakable stench of dwarf urine."
1660,Indian Boy,The same stench that was on the bed linens at the inn?
1661,Dwight,The very same.
1662,Chinese Boy,"Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!"
1663,Cubert,I cast a spell of detect magic.
1664,Bender,Dwight
1665,Cubert,"Right now, we're fighting for our lives in the lair of the Dragon Queen."
1666,Bender,"Ah, wrong. Right now you're ass-deep in a folding chair."
1667,Cubert,"Yes, but in my imagination I'm riding a golden Pegasus. Giddy up, Sparky!  Am I the only one seeing him sitting here with peanut butter on his face?"
1668,Dwight,"Bender, were you built without an imagination?"
1669,Bender,"What? Don't be stupid, of course not. It just hasn't descended yet."
1670,Bender,"Fry, do I have an imagination?"
1671,Fry,"I don't know, Bender. Why do you ask? Were the other boys making fun of you?"
1672,Bender,Mhmm. They said I couldn't imagine things.
1673,Fry,"Well, you never know unless you try. Like, I didn't know if I could swallow a softball, so I gave it my best shot and voilà!  Ah, thar she blows!"
1674,Ship's Computer,"Warning, out of dark matter fuel."
1675,Leela,That's not a warning. A warning is supposed to come before something bad happens.
1676,Ship's Computer,"Warning, engines will shut down in one second."
1677,Leela,That's more like it.
1678,Fry,Uh-oh. This space neighborhood looks kind of sketchy.
1679,Punk,Rock 'n' roll.
1680,Bender,"Hey, that punk stole our hood ornament. Now no one will know we have the LX package."
1681,Leela,"We need dark matter and we need it fast. Fry, check Nibbler's litter box. Maybe he dropped a steamer."
1682,Fry,"Aye, aye, Captain. Yes! I've never been so excited to see poop. Well, maybe once."
1683,ALL,
1684,Bender,There's gas in our ass.
1685,Leela,Can you believe the price of dark matter? It'd be cheaper to fill the tank with Nobel Prize winners' sperm.
1686,MOM COMPUTER,"Total dark matter purchased, $632.14. Your Speedpass will now be charged."
1687,Leela,You lousy...
1688,Sal,"Hey, gets a loads of that ugly ship. What shades of green is that? Puke?"
1689,Leela,For your information it's called Electric Mucus.
1690,Hoschel,More like puke.
1691,Sal,Whoa!
1692,Leela,"Yeah, why don't you come a little closer so my boot can hear you?"
1693,Bender,"Calm down, Leela. You can vent tonight on your blog."
1694,Sal,"What's the matters, you couldn't affords the LX package?"
1695,Hoschel,Puke-a-doodle-do.
1696,Leela,"You're making fun of our ship? Your ship is the most beat-up thing I've ever seen, and I've seen Mickey Rourke's head."
1697,Sal,"Yeah, she's a little Rourky, but you got to gets big time ugly to be five-time winners at a demolition derby."
1698,Fry,That's five more times than we've won or even entered.
1699,Bender,We do suck.
1700,Sal,"Yup, and it's gonna be six winses after tonights."
1701,Leela,We'll sees abouts that.
1702,Hermes,"Dark matter costs have tripled, so we must reduce expenses. Therefore, we will no longer provide complimentary porno magazines in the lounge."
1703,Scruffy,Dern it.
1704,Farnsworth,"And no more wasting fuel. From now on I'll be keeping a tight hold on the keys to the ship, swallowing them before I go to bed and recovering them the next morning."
1705,Amy,Splech!
1706,Hermes,"Professor, it's 4"
1707,Farnsworth,4
1708,Zoidberg,But won't that turn our ship into a piece of junk?
1709,Bender,"Shut up, Zoidberg. He's right, Leela."
1710,Leela,But we have no choice. Rednecks insulted us.
1711,Fry,So? Let it go. Don't let your temper get the better of...
1712,Leela,Rednecks!
1713,Zoidberg,"Using this magneto, I will now guide the keys up the thorax and out via the frontal face hole.  That's the storage locker, the boat, the other boat, pay dirt!"
1714,Rich Little,"Greetings, sports fans. Though whether this outpouring of inbreds can in fact be classified as a sport is a subject of no small scholarly debate."
1715,Sal,"Well, wells, well, if it ain'ts Princess Pukerella and her pukey puke-mobile."
1716,Leela,"Oh, yeah? Well... Shut up."
1717,Bender,"-Good comeback, Leela."
1718,Leela,"You shut up, too."
1719,Rich Little,"Rich Little, here, as Howard Cosell. And now to grace us with its rendition of the national anthem, please welcome what is left of the Dixie Chicks after their tragic matter transporter accident."
1720,The Dixie Chicks,We're in horrible pain.
1721,'Rich Little,And we are underway.
1722,Sal,Whoas!
1723,Leela,Yes! Now we're inflicting.
1724,Rich Little,Outstanding! Tonight we are witnessing a veritable clinic and that ludicrous hullabaloo known as demolition derby.
1725,George Takei,Rich Little
1726,Leela,Buckle your sphincters.
1727,Sal,That broad's insanes.
1728,Hoschel,"But you're insansier, right?"
1729,Sal,"Nah, I guess nots. I've decideds to relax and enjoy life from now ons."
1730,Leela,Yes! We did it! Rich Little
1731,Leela,"Now, I'll use the magnet to get the keys back in there."
1732,Zoidberg,What? You mean I cut a big hole in him for nothing?
1733,Leela,"Don't worry, the Professor won't even remember that he has a spaceship."
1734,Farnsworth,"Ah, my precious spaceship! My lone source of joy in the cold December of my days. Come, friends. Let's take her for a spin to the malt shop like old times."
1735,Leela,Leela to Zoidberg. Execute Distraction Protocol Alpha.
1736,Zoidberg,Roger that.
1737,Zoidberg,Look at me! Look at me! Look at me! Look at me! Ooh!  Don't look at me.
1738,Farnsworth,"Yes, she's a wonderful ship, all right. As beautiful now as the day I got botched laser eye surgery.  Great Godzilla's gonads! Who wasted precious fuel? Answer now or be punished."
1739,Leela,"All right, fine. I admit it."
1740,Farnsworth,You will be punished.
1741,Chinese Boy,"Oh, my gosh, 20!"
1742,Cubert,Yeah.
1743,Dwight,"Your pole arm does double damage, and the gelatinous cube dies in horrible poverty. Cubert"
1744,Indian Boy,Most ingenious.
1745,Chinese Boy,"Ah, Bender?"
1746,Bender,"Me? I, uh cast a spell of darkness.  Pretty imaginative, huh?"
1747,Cubert,"No, you just did the same thing as me, but with a dumb noise."
1748,Bender,Oh... You're right. I'm great in every way except I have no imagination. All I ever wanted is to play this magical game and I can't.
1749,Dwight,"Yes, you can. You just have to lose yourself in the fantasy. You have to believe the impossible is merely preposterous."
1750,Bender,"Okay. Here goes. Visor down. I believe, I believe.  I did it! I imagined something. For 1.3 milliseconds, I truly believed I was a noble robot in days of yonder."
1751,Chinese Boy,"Way to go, Bender."
1752,Cubert,"What is thy character's name, good sir?"
1753,Bender,"Uh, um... I am Titanius Anglesmith, fancy man of Cornwood."
1754,Farnsworth,Everybody out of the conference room. I am calling a conference.  Everybody get in here.  You wasted precious fuel just because you were insulted by some redneck yokel from beyond the stars?
1755,Leela,It was only half a ball.
1756,Farnsworth,That's not the point. Your temper is out of control. And to think I'd have never even known if it weren't for the lengthy and unsolicited tattling of Dr. Zoidberg.
1757,Zoidberg,She also took home two rolls of Scotch tape.
1758,Farnsworth,"Thank you, Dr. Zoidberg. Hermes, incentivize that employee. As for you, Leela, I'm letting you off with a warning."
1759,Leela,"Oh, thank you."
1760,Farnsworth,"A warning that will be administered by this 50,000-volt shock collar."
1761,Leela,"Zoidberg, I'm gonna put my boot so far up your cloaca, you'll be...  Ow!"
1762,Farnsworth,The collar will be triggered any time your thoughts turn to violence. Leela
1763,Farnsworth,Profanity.
1764,Leela,Son of a...  Ow!
1765,Farnsworth,Or perversions of a sexual nature.
1766,Leela,Ow!
1767,Hermes,"Sorry, it's the only collar they had in stock at Office Depot."
1768,Zoidberg,I hope you picked up some Scotch tape while you were there.
1769,Bender,That's a good one.
1770,Narrator,"Imagine, if you will, an announcer you can barely understand. He refers to a... *incoherent mumbling* But you're not quite sure what he said. He seems to be eating something, or perhaps he's a little drunk. It's remotely possible that he just said something about... The Scary Door."
1771,Soldier,"Firing, sir!"
1772,Soldier,It's all over. Our guns and bombs are useless against the aliens.
1773,Farmer,The saucers! Theys'a crashin'!
1774,Narrator,"In the end, it was not guns or bombs that defeated the aliens, but that humblest of all God's creatures, the Tyrannosaurus Rex."
1775,Leela,I can't believe TiVo suggested that piece of...  collar.
1776,Hermes,"Alas, no. I got the key but not the authority."
1777,Leela,"Yeow! Well, who does have the authority?"
1778,Hermes,Only the staff doctor. You'll have to convince him that you have resolved your anger issues.
1779,Leela,I don't have any god da-  A terrifying red dragon.
1780,Indian Boy,What do we do? What do we do?
1781,Bender,"Wait, I know. I make use of my rod of fireballs.  Everyone knows red dragons are immune to fireballs as well as all other forms of incendiary attack."
1782,Bender,"Yes, but I aim not at the dragon but at the river itself to create a shroud of steam through which we can escape."
1783,ALL,Whoa!
1784,Dwight,"Sweet pony of Sierra Leone, it worked!"
1785,Chinese Boy,We did it!
1786,Cubert,Success!
1787,Fry,"Bender, smell this milk."
1788,Bender,"I go not by the name of Bender, you fleshy fool. I am Titanius Anglesmith, fancy man of Cornwood."
1789,Fry,"Professor, something's bothering me."
1790,Monkey,"Well, you can always talk to me about anything, Fry. What's on your mind?"
1791,Fry,"Well, it's... it's about my friend Bender."
1792,Farnsworth Monkey,Mmm. I see. Show me on this anatomically correct doll exactly where he touched you.
1793,Fry,"No, it's nothing like that. It's just that I am worried about him. He's being playing an awful lot of Dungeons & Dragons."
1794,Farnsworth Monkey,"Dungeons &... Good God! Hasn't he seen the Afterschool Special? You've got to talk to him, Fry. Make him quit now before he completely loses his mind."
1795,Fry,"Okay, I will."
1796,Farnsworth Monkey,Good boy. Just don't let him touch you down there.
1797,Zoidberg,"Well, here's your problem, right here. You've got a skull embedded in your head."
1798,Leela,"You're absolutely right, Doctor. Can the collar come off now?"
1799,Zoidberg,Let me just peel your head a little and see if I can get that skull out.
1800,Zoidberg,"What is it, already? What's the cause of your anger?"
1801,Leela,"I guess I would have to say, I hate you."
1802,Zoidberg,I'm beginning to understand. It all goes back to your parents.
1803,Leela,What?
1804,Zoidberg,You harbour resentment because they pushed you to study medicine when all you ever wanted was to be a song-and-dance man.  Why? Whyyy?
1805,Leela,I was raised in an orphanarium. My parents are sewer mutants who I never even met until a few years ago.
1806,Zoidberg,"Then you've got to go to them and work this song-and-dance stuff out. Maybe have them cook me nice dinner. No scallions. I hate them.  Amy, cancel my appointments."
1807,Amy,Stop calling me.
1808,Fry,"Bender, please don't get mad, but I think you might be playing too much Dungeons & Dragons."
1809,Bender,"You're absolutely right, Fry. I almost went insane, but after this heart-to-heart talk, I've decided to quit."
1810,Fry,Really? Whew! That's a load off my toad.
1811,Bender,"Now, if you'll excuse me. Bender"
1812,Hermaphrobot,"You couldn't afford it, honey."
1813,Hermes,He also left a small pile of treasure on the living room rug.
1814,Bender,"Foul dragon, meet thy doom."
1815,Turanga Munda,"Would you like a napkin, Doctor?"
1816,Zoidberg,Thank you.
1817,Leela,"Satisfied, Zoidberg? My relationship with my parents is fine."
1818,Turanga Munda,"Now, hold on, Leela. Maybe this torture collar is good for you."
1819,Leela,What?  Ow!
1820,Turanga Munda,It'll control your temper. Men like a woman who's not always slamming their head in the car door.
1821,Turanga Morris,She's right. That's what first attracted me to your mother. Turanga Munda
1822,Leela,"Mom, he's a cockroach from outer space."
1823,Turanga Morris,"Hey, it's what's-his-name from the surface. The bi-clops."
1824,Fry,"Ha-have you seen Bender? He's gone nuts. Also, smell this milk."
1825,Bender,Prepare for a surprise attack.
1826,Zoidberg,Someone do something.
1827,Leela,"I would, but...  Ow! Take my collar off."
1828,Zoidberg,"I can't, I'm still eating.  Help me, Leela."
1829,Bender,I cast upon thee a spell of fireball! Zoidberg
1830,Fry,"Beholdeth, Titanius, I cast a freeze ray upon you."
1831,Bender,"That's ridiculous. There's no such thing as a ""freeze ray."" What, you mean a cone of coldness?"
1832,Fry,"Yeah, that."
1833,Bender,No! No! Fancy men are defenseless against cone of coldness. Fry
1834,Zoidberg,"Relax, Fry. I'm a doctor. I'm sure the robut will be just fine with a little help."
1835,Bender,"Help, help.   Help! Dr. Perceptron"
1836,Intercom Assistant,"Yes, Doctor. Bender"
1837,Dr. Perceptron,"So,  Bender, I understand you're having trouble separating fantasy from reality."
1838,Bender,Says who? Was it the bugbear? Is he talking about me again?
1839,Dr. Perceptron,I understand. Commence therapy. Fry
1840,Amy,So what happened to Bender?
1841,Fry,He's at a spa.
1842,Amy,"Wow, there's a spa in the nut house?"
1843,Zoidberg,"Friends, friends, stop everything. There's food in this shaker. Leela"
1844,Hermes,Are you still angry?
1845,Leela,No.  Ow!
1846,Hermes,It also shocks you when you lie.
1847,Farnsworth,"Quiet, everyone. The network news is on and if I, a 165-year-old man, don't watch it, who will?"
1848,Morbo,"Thankfully, the amazing talking horse was rescued and safely returned to the meat department."
1849,Linda,"Turning to the less stupid portion of our broadcast, fuel prices hit an all-time high today due to the ongoing dark matter shortage."
1850,Morbo,"Earlier, our own Morbo sat down with Mom, CEO of Mom's Friendly Multinational Energy Conglomerate."
1851,Morbo,"Oh! Hello, Morbo the Annihilator, here, sitting down to a delightful tea in this fake living room set.  Thank you for joining us, Mom."
1852,Mom,"My pleasure, sugarplum."
1853,Morbo,"Mom, you control the world's only dark matter mine. Tell us, why are fuel prices so high?"
1854,Mom,"Oh! It's terrible, isn't it? Dark matter is just so rare nowadays, but we'll keep pinching loaf after loaf from the bowels of the earth, even if I lose money on every log."
1855,Morbo,"If you are losing money, how did you post record profits last quarter?"
1856,Mom,"You look thin, care for one of my famous pecan clusters?"
1857,Morbo,Mom
1858,Farnsworth,"Greedy old hag, taste the wrath of my fuzzy slipper. Leela"
1859,Farnsworth,"Oohh... I bet you'd like to know. I bet you'd like to know, indeed."
1860,Walt,"Hello, Mother. How did the interview go?"
1861,Mom,It made me want to puke my face off. Where's my Thigh Blaster?
1862,Larry,"Right here, Mom."
1863,Mom,Shut up!
1864,Larry,"Okay, thank you."
1865,Mom,"Burn, you damn thighs. Burn!"
1866,Igner,"Mommy, are you upset 'cause of the dark matter shortage?"
1867,Mom,"There is no shortage, you moronic ass-brain!"
1868,Igner,There's not? But you said...
1869,Mom,Allow me to explain. Suppose this hand represents current reserves of dark matter and this hand represents consumer demand.
1870,Igner,Uh-huh.
1871,Farnsworth,I just bet you'd like to know why I'm so angry about this dark matter shortage. I bet very much you'd like to know.
1872,Amy,"You're right, Professor. We would like to know."
1873,Farnsworth,"Really? I didn't think anyone was interested. It all started 30-odd years ago.  I was working in Mom's laboratories for the third time after twice before realizing how evil she was and vowing never to work for her again. But somehow the rich, wrong stench of her boney charms kept calling me back."
1874,Zoidberg,"Don't stop, Professor. I'm getting aroused.  And thus against all probabilities... it happened. [The dark matter particles in the particle accelerator begin colliding and exploding. A large explosion leaves only a single item - the single non-local metaparticle crystal."
1875,Younger Farnsworth,Dang!
1876,Farnsworth,I'm sure I don't need to explain that all dark matter in the universe is linked in the form of a single non-local meta-particle.
1877,Amy,Guhh! Stop patronizing us.
1878,Farnsworth,"So, in one instant, I had transformed all dark matter everywhere into a new crystalline form...  ...making it the most potent fuel since primitive man first ignited mastodon flatulence to heat his cave."
1879,Younger Mom,"I'm intrigued, Hubert. You have my undivided attention."
1880,Younger Mom,"Shut up, you milk-sucking leeches! A new super fuel, eh? We're rich."
1881,Younger Farnsworth,"Indeed, we are."
1882,Younger Mom,"Not you, we. Us, we.  I'm getting back together with my ex-husband."
1883,Younger Farnsworth,Wernstrom!
1884,Younger Wernstrom,"You've been played, Farnsworth. Played like a cheap harpsichord."
1885,Younger Mom,"Walt, fire that employee like Mommy taught you."
1886,Leela,"Professor, maybe I can help you get even with Mom. I spend most of my time thinking about how to get revenge on a bad boss."
1887,Fry,"Me, too."
1888,Zoidberg,Ditto!
1889,Hermes,Likewise.
1890,Amy,I made a blinding powder.
1891,Farnsworth,"Thanks, but that won't be necessary because I have the ultimate weapon.  You see, in the instant the energy crystal was created, there also came into being an opposite crystal made of pure anti-backwards energy."
1892,ALL,Wow!
1893,Hermes,So?
1894,Farnsworth,"So, this! If ever the two crystals should meet, their wave functions would collapse like Raymond Burr's trampoline, once again rendering all dark matter inert and useless as fuel."
1895,Hermes,But then we'll have no fuel.
1896,Farnsworth,"But once we free society from dependence on Mom's dark matter, scientists will finally care enough to develop cleaner, alternative fuels."
1897,Fry,Scientists like you!
1898,Farnsworth,"No, not me. I'm too busy developing makeup for dogs. That's where the money is."
1899,Leela,This is our chance to teach Mom a lesson. Come on! Let's take the anti-crystal and shove it up Mom's regular crystal.
1900,ALL,Yeah.
1901,Hermes,Fight the power!
1902,Farnsworth,"There's just one, small problem, and it's a big one. I hid the crystal and I can't remember where."
1903,Hermes,"Well, surely it's just a matter of waiting till you next move your bowels and then using a potato masher..."
1904,Farnsworth,"Don't you think I already tried that? No. I'm afraid, the crystal is lost forever."
1905,Dwight,Nine? You did it. You outwitted the fungus.
1906,ALL,Woohoo!
1907,Chinese Boy,Who needs girls?
1908,Dr. Perceptron,"Since you have all proven resistant to individualized hammer therapy, I now prescribe group therapy."
1909,Rosie,"Everything must be clean, very clean. That's why the dog had to die. He was a dirty dog. Dirty, dirty. Also, that boy, Elroy. Dirty, dirty."
1910,Dr. Perceptron,Who would like to share their feelings?
1911,Intercom Assistant,I feel unappreciated at work.
1912,Dr. Perceptron,What? I can barely understand you.
1913,Intercom Assistant,I said I feel...
1914,Mad Hatterbot,Change places.
1915,Roberto,"Well, well. Looks like old Roberto is the focus of attention now. Stop looking at me. Dr. Perceptron"
1916,Roberto,I was designed by a team of engineers attempting to build an insane robot. But it seems they failed.
1917,Convenience Store Bot,"Um, actually... Bender"
1918,Roberto,Amen.
1919,Dr. Perceptron,"Good, Bender."
1920,Rosie,That's right.
1921,Bender,"There's a band of river trolls living in the moat and they may have no intention of letting us out of this castle, unless we hand over the Golden Scepter of Zanthor."
1922,Roberto,Say what? Dude's crazy.
1923,Dr. Perceptron,"Bender, please, try to..."
1924,Bender,"I know not of this Bender. I am Titanius Anglesmith, fancy man of Cornwood."
1925,Dr. Perceptron,You are suffering a breakdown. Now stop. Hammer time.  I'm in your seat. I forgot we had changed places.
1926,Mad Hatterbot,Change places? Farnsworth
1927,Amy,You perfected dog mascara?
1928,Farnsworth,"Far from it. If you ask me, they look like a bunch of hookers. But what I have invented is a means of locating the missing crystal.  When I push this button, the crystal will emit a high-frequency stink."
1929,Zoidberg,Hurray!
1930,Farnsworth,"There. Now, with any luck I'll detect it with my smelling aid.  I just pray to all powerful Atheismo that we find it before Mom does."
1931,Hermes,"Do you smell the crystal, Professor?"
1932,Farnsworth,"No, damn it! Just the alluring scent of Obsession for spaniels."
1933,Dwight,Dude. Who whipped an egger?
1934,Dwight,"Yeah? Well, he who denied it, supplied it."
1935,Cubert,"Well, he who articulated it, particulated it."
1936,Dwight,"Well, he who refuted it, tooted it."
1937,Cubert,Stalemate.
1938,Mom,Jesus craps. The anti-backwards crystal.
1939,Larry,Ow! Ah... sorry?
1940,Mom,"Relax, it's not your fault.  With that crystal, Farnsworth could completely destroy my dark matter empire. I underestimated that sagging old bag of bones and gonads."
1941,Inger,Is that man bad?
1942,Mom,"Very bad, Igner. And that's why I need you three to go steal the anti-crystal away from him. But be careful. You'll need all your stoogely cunning."
1943,Walt,Exterminators.
1944,Fry,"Oh, great. What do we got? Wall gophers? Toilet snails?"
1945,Walt,"No, I'm afraid you've got owls. Over there, see?"
1946,Igner,Ow!
1947,Walt,"Dump the bag, you nitwit."
1948,Larry,"Hey, watch it.  Ow!"
1949,Fry,"I was looking over there for a long time but I didn't see any... Oh, there they are. Gross."
1950,Walt,"We've got to act fast. Larry, get out the geigersniffer."
1951,Larry,"I don't know, Walt. You're just gonna hit me with it."
1952,Walt,No. I'm going to hit you with this. Fry
1953,Amy,Really? I don't think so.
1954,Leela,"Me, neither. Now, Sex and the City, that's funny."
1955,Dwight,"After wandering aimlessly in the swamp, you suddenly...  wander aimlessly in the swamp."
1956,Walt,There it is. Cubert
1957,Walt,"I'm sorry, little boy. You see, we're owl exterminators."
1958,Igner,We are owl extermin...  Ow!
1959,Walt,"And what we have here is an owl egg that's about to hatch into an owl larva. So, if you don't mind, we'll just take this and..."
1960,Cubert,"What are you, stupid? That's a dodecahedral crystal I found hidden in the downstairs walrus tank."
1961,Dwight,"And I wrote numbers on it so we could use it as a D12, 'cause I have the best handwriting."
1962,Cubert,Do not.
1963,Dwight,Do too.
1964,Cubert,Do not.
1965,Dwight,Do too.
1966,Cubert,You win this round.
1967,Farnsworth,What's going on here?
1968,Igner,We're owl exterminators.
1969,Farnsworth,Oh? Then you won't have any problem exterminating this owl.
1970,Farnsworth,"My anti-backwards crystal.  So it's you three. I should have known Mom would send her brainless brood to do her dirty work. Walt, the leader among imbeciles."
1971,Walt,Hey! They resent that.
1972,Farnsworth,"Larry, the sniveling middle child."
1973,Larry,Sorry. Thank you.
1974,Farnsworth,"And you, Igner. The evil I could tolerate, but the stupidity... Igner"
1975,Farnsworth,Good God. Just knowing we're in the same genus makes me embarrassed to call myself homo. Igner
1976,Fry,There. The repairs are complete.
1977,Farnsworth,Rake up some dark matter and top off the tank.
1978,Leela,"Well, there isn't any dark matter. Nibbler hasn't pooped at all. And he ate a whole family of koalas last night. Nibbler! Nibbler!"
1979,Farnsworth,I'm not interested in the whereabouts of your cutesy-fruitsy space rat. The only thing that matters right now is this crystal. Leela
1980,Farnsworth,And be careful with that crystal. Bender
1981,Dr. Perceptron,"Even relaxation therapy has failed. Diagnosis, insanity. Nurse, schedule a robotomy for Bender."
1982,Nurse Ratchet,"Yes, Doctor. I'll get the tools from the shed."
1983,Dr. Perceptron,"It's a very painful procedure. So until then, just try to relax."
1984,Mom,What are you laughing at?
1985,Larry,Your laugh. It's just so infectious.
1986,Mom,"So's herpes. Now, shut up! You and Walt, lead the killbots to the surface and blow Farnsworth out of the sky."
1987,Walt,What about Igner?
1988,Mom,That hairless ape? I swear. When he came out I flipped a coin whether to keep him or the after-birth.
1989,Walt,"Yes, Mother. You told that story at his graduation."
1990,Mom,"I'm afraid he can't be trusted on this mission. You see, there is a terrible secret about Igner I've never told anyone. And here it is."
1991,Walt,Continue returning fire.
1992,Killbot 1,What?
1993,Killbot 2,What did they say?
1994,Killbot 1,I don't know. I can't hear a thing.
1995,Killbot 3,"Hey, what's everybody talking about?"
1996,Farnsworth,Mayday! Mayday!  We weren't actually in the ship.
1997,Leela,"Okay, team, these red-hot, razor-sharp fans are the only safe way into the mine."
1998,Fry,"Hmm, uh, ladies first. Elevator Steward"
1999,Farnsworth,Shut your mouth.
2000,Elevator Steward,I'm just talking about the shaft.
2001,Fry,"Jeez, doesn't that shock collar hurt?"
2002,Leela,"Actually, feels kind of good. I guess I'm starting to associate it with the pleasure of beating people up."
2003,Walt,"We shot them down, Mother. The intruders never even got to Sector 1."
2004,Security Woman,Intruders in Sector 15. Intruders in Sector 15.
2005,Mom,Ugh... Sometimes I don't know why I even bother to slap you.   All Killbots to Sector 15.
2006,Killbot 1,What did she say?
2007,Killbot 2,Fry
2008,Leela,We're trapped.
2009,Farnsworth,The main pit must be in here. I'm detecting vast quantities of Dark Matter.
2010,Leela,Step aside turkey-neck. I think I know the code.
2011,Farnsworth,We're in. We're in the heart of the mine. The very source of all Mom's wealth and...
2012,Leela,My God! This isn't a crap mine. It's a crap farm.
2013,Fry,Is there really so much of a distinction? I mean...
2014,Nibbler,"Leela, it's me, Nibbler."
2015,Leela,"Oh, my God, you look horrible, Nibbler. I think I'm going to vomit."
2016,Nibblonian,Nibbler is over there.
2017,Leela,"Oh, sorry. Nibbler! Oh, my poor little snuzzy-wuzzams. Are they treating you okay?"
2018,Nibbler,"No, they are force-feeding us so we poop more dark matter. It's horrible.  Those are good. You've got to help us."
2019,Nibblonians,Help us!
2020,Nibblonian,"Help us, for God's sakes!"
2021,Leela,Nibbler made a bo-bo.
2022,Nibbler,"Yes, but not on my terms. I will not be treated like... Hey, wait, aren't you amazed I can speak?"
2023,Fry,"Well, actually, no. You forgot to blank our memories after you spoke last time."
2024,Nibbler,You mean you've known I was sentient? Then why did you let me eat Friskies and make bo-bo in a litter box?
2025,Fry,"Well, you're cuter that way."
2026,Farnsworth,Cute as a baby's buttocks.
2027,Leela,So what happened? How did Mom capture all you Nibblonians?
2028,Nibbler,"It was a veritable Eden, brimming with unique and irreplaceable species.  I was Supreme Fuzzler of a Nibblonian scientific outpost. It was paradise, until they came. One of your DOOP ships struck dark matter, little realizing it was not a natural deposit, but rather centuries of Nibblonian fecal material."
2029,Fry,"Wow, the big fecal enchilada. Anyone else hungry?"
2030,Nibbler,The DOOP contracted a ruthless businesswoman to spearhead the mining operation.
2031,Leela,Let me guess. Mom?
2032,Nibbler,The very same.
2033,Fry,Can I also guess Mom?
2034,Nibbler,"To reduce cost she started a new enterprise, Mom's Friendly Robots, to build robot slaves. Remember this was back in the days before Robot Lincoln."
2035,Mom,"Faster, faster!"
2036,Robot Slave,I'm going exactly as fast as you built me to go.
2037,Mom,"Oh, wise guy, huh?"
2038,Robot Slave,Ow!
2039,Nibbler,"Eventually, the planet was mined down to a hollow shell and my people were forced to evacuate."
2040,Mom,"So, that's where it comes from. We may have a whole new source of Dark Matter on our hands."
2041,Igner,Eww!
2042,Nibbler,"As it turned out I was the lucky one.  Unbeknownst to me, Mom captured my colleagues and enslaved them here in this... this... crap farm."
2043,Nibblonian,"There's nothing to do but eat and crap, eat and crap. It's like visiting my parents."
2044,Nibbler,"As for me, I emerged from behind the ""bush of many uses"" to find I had been left behind. I was doomed, doomed."
2045,Leela,"Hello, there."
2046,Nibbler,"Startled, my cuteness reflex kicked in."
2047,Leela,I'll call him Nibbler.
2048,Nibbler,"A silly name for a high-ranking Fuzzler. But, hey, I was glad to be rescued. Leela"
2049,Nibbler,I was kidnapped yesterday by Mom's vile sons in their moronic disguises.
2050,Igner,I was an owl exterminator.  Do you have the crysal?
2051,Farnsworth,"It's pronounced ""crystal,"" you lump."
2052,Igner,"Go, run fast. Walt"
2053,Igner,Me?
2054,Walt,"Yes, you. You're the only one here."
2055,Igner,"If I'm the only one here, then how could I see anyone?"
2056,Larry,"He's got a point, Walt."
2057,Walt,So does my knee.
2058,Fry,This wouldn't be so bad if it weren't for the chickens.
2059,Nurse Ratchet,"Don't worry, those clamps are for my own protection."
2060,Dr. Perceptron,"Do you know where you are, Bender?"
2061,Bender,"Sure do, I'm in the magical land of Cornwood, frolicking with wenches."
2062,Dr. Perceptron,Close. You're in the loony bin for a robotomy. I will begin by drilling through the eye to access the frontal processor. Nurse Ratchet
2063,Dr. Perceptron,Either way is fine.
2064,Bender,Does anyone else smell burning dragon beak?
2065,Mom,"Wherever you are, Farnsworth, my boys will find you."
2066,Mom,You'll thank me some day when you are slapping your own kids.  I know Farnsworth's game. He is going to try to poke his clammy old crystal at my hot fiery crystal.
2067,Larry,Mom!
2068,Mom,If the crystals get within six inches of each other...  Wham! All my dark matter will be worthless.
2069,Mom,Get them!
2070,Leela,"Keep going, Professor. I'll take care of the ditz brothers.  Ooh. That feels good."
2071,Mom,"Oh, for crying out...  Oh, the freaking battery's dead. Walt, where's the charger?"
2072,Walt,"In the hardware drawer, Mother. Mom"
2073,Farnsworth,"We're almost there. The crystals are beginning to engorge.  Hang on. I'm on it. Okay, there!"
2074,Fry,"Save us, Catman."
2075,Mom,"It's over, Hubert. Give me the anti-backwards crystal."
2076,Farnsworth,Never!
2077,Farsnworth,No! Dr. Perceptron
2078,Bender,Cornwood! Dr. Perceptron
2079,Nurse Rachet,"But, Doctor, I love you. Mom"
2080,Frydo,"This is crazy. Ow! What the... You okay, Leela?"
2081,Leegola,"Yeah, I think so."
2082,Frydo,Wait a second. Is there something different about your hooves? Leegola
2083,Frydo,"Where the hell are we, hell?"
2084,Frydo,Bender?
2085,Titanius Anglesmith,I know not of this Bender. I'm Titanius Anglesmith. Welcome to Cornwood!
2086,Titanius Anglesmith,"Wretched peasants, put aside your cares and feast on the succulent flesh of the roast munchkin!"
2087,Peasent Cook,Care for a slice of scroto?
2088,Frydo,"Uh... that's his name, right?"
2089,Peasent Cook,"'Tis also that, sir."
2090,Titanius Anglesmith,"We're honored this eve by a visit from my friends of old, Frydo and Leegola. So let the dwarves do their gay dance and let the gnomes play their sissy piccolos. Dwarf"
2091,Titanius Anglesmith,To the kitchen with him!
2092,Dwarf,Wait! Wait! Wait! I do impressions. Behold! The swamp hag
2093,Titanius Anglesmith,Don't let him get too crispy.
2094,Calculon,Lord Anglesmith.
2095,Titanius Anglesmith,"You have ridden hard, noble squire. May I offer you a horn of ale and a shank of dwarf?"
2096,Calculon,"'Tis dire news, sire. Dark riders approach."
2097,Titanius Anglesmith,Frydo! Saddle up that trusty steed.
2098,Frydo,What's happening? And why am I enjoying it so much?
2099,Titanius Anglesmith,Foul beast-bags! Meet thy doom!
2100,Waltazar,Follow me.
2101,Waltazar,"Damn thee, Ignus."
2102,Ignus,"Well, you said to follow you."
2103,Waltazar,"Well, now I say follow this! Larius"
2104,Waltazar,"Oh, no!"
2105,Titanius Anglesmith,I'm back bab-...
2106,Die of Power,Seven.
2107,Titanius Anglesmith,"""Banish foes""? Cool."
2108,Waltazar,No! No!
2109,Larius,"I got to say, I had no idea the Die of Power was so powerful."
2110,Waltazar,Did you have any idea of...
2111,Swamp Hag,"Get out of my swamp, you kids!"
2112,Leegola,"I can't believe I'm saying this, but that was really exciting. I've never felt so alive.  What else can we slay? Is that a hobbit over there?"
2113,Titanius Anglesmith,"No, that's a hobo and a rabbit. But they're making a hobbit."
2114,Frydo,"Thank God, an outhouse. I can't hold it in much longer. And by it, I mean my entrails."
2115,Titanius Anglesmith,"Hush! This be no outhouse, but the lair of the great wizard Grayfarn."
2116,Greyfarn,Who is it? Titanius Anglesmith
2117,Greyfarn,"Just a moment.  Methinks the wizard be casting a powerful spell, indeed."
2118,Greyfarn,"Come in! Come in! Yes. 'Tis a powerful object in both our worlds. If you failed to destroy it in yours, perhaps you were brought here that you might have a second chance."
2119,Frydo,"So, this land is real?"
2120,Greyfarn,"Oh, dreadfully real. If you die here, you'll really be dead. But instead of science, we believe in crazy hocus-pocus. It's like Kansas."
2121,Leegola,God help us.
2122,Greyfarn,"Cornwood's troubles began hundreds or perhaps millions of years ago.  Deep in the Geysers of Gygax, Momon herself injection-molded the Dice of Power from the living plastic."
2123,Momon,"Damn, these are hot."
2124,Leegola,Ah ha! In our universe she's called Mom.
2125,Greyfarn,"In your universe, are you taught not to interrupt? Evidently not. Anyway, Momon spawned three rotten sons, whom you've already had the displeasure of meeting. Waltazar, Larius, and the dumbest of all, the halfwit Ignus, bastard son of Momon and the brainless He-demon. Curse you, Momon, queen of all that is evil and not very good in bed. And I'm not just saying that because she dumped me.   Yes, I was once her consort. I was blinded by love, and later, scorpion venom.  I'm blind!  But Momon has one weakness. She put too much of her power into this. The generalissimo of dice."
2126,Greyfarn,"Don't be foolish, Titanius. If you had paid attention in freshman alchemy, instead of frequenting the bawdyhouse, you'd know there's only one way to destroy it. In the boiling plastic from which it was molded."
2127,Frydo,Like that machine that makes wax lions at the zoo.
2128,Greyfarn,"Quiet, you. We must infiltrate the Geysers of Gygax, the impenetrable stronghold of Momon."
2129,Titanius Anglesmith,"Impossible. Impossible, I say."
2130,Greyfarn,"No, Titanius. For we maintain one advantage, the element of surprise. Titanius Anglesmith"
2131,Hermaphrodite,Stop right there.
2132,Frydo,Hermes?
2133,Leegola,He's a centaur like me.
2134,Frydo,You wish.
2135,Hermaphrodite,"I am Hermaphrodite, most beautiful of centaurs. Gaze upon me and weep at my loveliness."
2136,Greyfarn,Very well.
2137,Titanius Anglesmith,"Loveliest of centaurs, we seek to end Momon's reign of evil. Have you stout fighters at your command?"
2138,Hermaphrodite,One thousand archers of truest aim.  Fire!
2139,Titanius Anglesmith,"Hey guys, I forgot I had this pumpkin. Leegola"
2140,Female Centaur,We centaurs are creatures of peace.
2141,Leegola,"Oh, Lord."
2142,Hermaphrodite,"Violence is never justified. We shall not join your quest. And furthermore, if mayhem be your intent, you may not cross our lands."
2143,Leegola,Or what?
2144,Hermaphrodite,You may pass.
2145,Greyfarn,"We're not there, we're here."
2146,Titanius Anglesmith,"No, this way."
2147,Greyfarn,"I mean, here."
2148,Greyfarn,"Thank you, kindly, Treedledum."
2149,Treedledum,Okey-doke. Anything else I can do?
2150,Leegola,You know who I'm gonna miss? That tree guy.
2151,Greyfarn,"Bad news, fancy men. Momon's guards stand watch at the pass. 'Tis as if she somehow anticipated us."
2152,Titanius Anglesmith,And so our quest comes to an end. I only regret not giving up sooner.
2153,Greyfarn,"Fret not, Titanius. For we still have one hope, the Cave of Hopelessness."
2154,Titanius Anglesmith,Let me know how that turns out.
2155,Ogre,Halt. Are you on the list? I'm not seeing you on the list.
2156,Leegola,I'll split this doofus in half.
2157,Titanius Anglesmith,"Wait, I got it. Yeah. My cousin's in the band. The band of merry men. Please, we were already in there. I just need to go back for my coat."
2158,Gynecaladriel,"I am Gynecaladriel, queen of the water nymphos."
2159,Leegola,All right. I'll split this doofus in half.
2160,Gynecaladriel,"Stand aside and I will use my powers to overwhelm the guard.  Behold, the deed is done."
2161,Titanius Anglesmith,Hi oh!
2162,Frydo,"Mr. Wizard, why is this place called the Cave of Hopelessness?"
2163,Greyfarn,"Oh, fear not, lad. 'Tis named for its discoverer, Reginald Hopelessness..."
2164,Frydo,Whew!
2165,Greyfarn,...the first man to be eaten alive by the Tunneling Horror.
2166,Frydo,What's that? The Tunneling Horror?
2167,Gynecaladriel,"No, it's morcs."
2168,Morcs,"Morc calling Orson. Morc Nanu, nanu. Shazbot."
2169,Titanius Anglesmith,"Oh, God, no. They're so aggravating."
2170,Morcs,"Oh, fantastic.  Mindy, Mindy, Mindy."
2171,Gynecaladriel,Shut up! Shut up!
2172,Morcs,"Oh, fantastic. Oh, fantastic. Oh, wonderful."
2173,Frydo,Maybe it'll go away if we just don't laugh at it.
2174,Titanius Anglesmith,It doesn't.
2175,Morcs,"Nanu, nanu.  Uh-oh."
2176,Zoidberg,Enough already with the banging and the swashbuckling.
2177,Leegola,"Oh, I'm gonna enjoy killing you.  Again? What, am I talking to myself over here?"
2178,Leegola,Mutilate! Zoidberg
2179,Leegola,"I'll kill you and eat your heart, you abomination."
2180,Frydo,"Leela, it's over. You killed him enough."
2181,Leegola,I'm not taking any chances with the Tunneling Horror.
2182,Zoidberg,"What? I'm not the Tunneling Horror. I hate that guy. Always with the tunneling. Anyway, I'm dead. Leegola"
2183,Zoidberg,Oh! There he goes again.
2184,Titanius Anglesmith,The Tunneling Horror! Frydo
2185,Greyfarn,Do about what?
2186,Frydo,"Why aren't you killing it, Leela? You love killing."
2187,Leegola,"No, no more killing."
2188,Zoidberg,"Oh! So, suddenly, Miss Goody Four-shoes over here doesn't kill anymore. She killed me not five minutes ago. What am I? Chopped liver?"
2189,Leegola,Shut up. Zoidberg
2190,Leegola,You're on your own.  I refuse to hurt another living thing. Frydo
2191,Titanius Anglesmith,Any time now!
2192,Frydo,The Die of Power. I forgot to remember to roll it.
2193,Die of Power,Three.
2194,Frydo,"""Grow?"" I don't see anything growing. Everything is getting smaller.  Wow, that was intense. You guys got to try the Die of Power."
2195,Titanius Anglesmith,I'll take a hit.
2196,Frydo,"Hands off the dodecalicious.  Resist the allure of the die. For to defeat Momon, we must melt it in the super bombastic, bubbling plastic from whence it came."
2197,Greyfarn,"For to defeat Momon, we must melt it in the super bombastic, bubbling plastic from whence it came."
2198,Momon,I send you to kill them and they're not even maimed? That's what I get for sending boys to do a mom's job.
2199,Larius,"Sorry, Mom."
2200,Momon,Sorry doesn't put heads on my table. Peaches.  You're up.
2201,Ignus,I like this part but I don't like...
2202,Centaur Opponent,"You are an able opponent, Hermaphrodite. But hear me well when I posit that we must abhor violence in all its forms."
2203,Hermaphrodite,I offer a dissenting opinion.
2204,ALL,Ah! Don't hurt me.
2205,Leegola,"I'm not here to hurt you. Or anything ever again. Please, teach me the centaurs' ways of wimpiness."
2206,Hermaphrodite,What do you offer in return?
2207,Titanius Anglesmith,"Yes! We made it out of that godforsaken cave. Now, what's the fastest way home? Back through the cave?  Ow!"
2208,Greyfarn,"We're close now, my friends. So close, I can practically feel the heat of the fiery molten plastic."
2209,Gynecaladriel,You're standing in the fire.
2210,Greyfarn,"Oh, my.  Alas, our path is blocked by Momon's army of evil. As well as her navy of moral dubiousness."
2211,Titanius Anglesmith,Wait a second. Mayhaps we might raise an army of our own. We're but an hour's ride from Wipe Castle.
2212,Greyfarn,"Of course. Wipe Castle. And while we're there, we can get some of those greasy little dwarf burgers."
2213,Gynecaladriel,Ooh! I love those. You can eat like eight of them without gaining any weight because of all the diarrhea.
2214,Greyfarn,"Sleep deep, fair snoozles. At dawn, we ride for Wipe Castle. Momon"
2215,Waltazar,"Right away, Mother. I'll just leave a small contingent behind in case..."
2216,Momon,"I said, everything. Peaches!"
2217,Peaches,I'm in the tub.
2218,Momon,"Waltazar, you and Larius shall lead the assault."
2219,Waltazar,What about Ignus?
2220,Momon,"I'm afraid he can't be trusted on this mission. You see, there is a terrible secret about Ignus I've never told anyone. And here it is."
2221,Momon,It's a good day to be evil. Frydo
2222,Reflection Host,"Tell you what, you want to defend a magic artifact, and I mean, defend it good, then what you need is a top-quality knife."
2223,Frydo,Me is listening.
2224,Reflection Host,"The Eviscerator is one of the finest, if not the finest, tactical folder on the market today. We're talking 440 stainless, quick release and... I don't believe this. Is this a stag horn handle at this price?"
2225,Reflection Host 2,"It is, yeah. It's a stag horn."
2226,Reflection Host,"At this price? You have got to be kidding me. That's got to be some kind of mistake, right there."
2227,Reflection Host 2,"Now, you folks at home, I know what you're thinking. You're thinking, that can't be stag horn. It's got to be the cheaper manticore horn. But, I've got the specs right here and I'll tell you what, this is the real deal."
2228,Reflection Host,Unbelievable.
2229,Reflection Host 2,"It is unbelievable. That's exactly what it is. I mean, this is... I have no words to describe this deal. Honestly, have you ever seen stag horn at this price?"
2230,Reflection Host,"No, no, I don't believe I ever have."
2231,Reflection Host 2,1101-1816 is the item number on this one.
2232,Reflection Host,"You know what, we're gonna have to  put a clock on this deal, folks. Two minutes. Can I get a clock at two minutes up there?"
2233,Reflection Host 2,"Two minutes at most. Honestly, I'd be surprised if they last that long."
2234,Reflection Host,"Oh, I'd be very surprised, shocked really. Now, I know the lines are busy, people, but keep dialing in if you want a truly exceptional knife to slice up your friends in their sleep."
2235,Titanius Anglesmith,"He tried to murder me. He tried... Woah, cool. Is that the stag horn?"
2236,Greyfarn,"Alas, Frydo's weakness was no match for the die's strength. We can only hope he forges on alone to the Geysers."
2237,Titanius Anglesmith,I can hope my ass is made of ice-cream but that don't make me a hot fudge sundae.
2238,Greyfarn,"As for us, we must press on to Wipe Castle, though the journey be long and I fear I may not live to see it."
2239,Gynecaladriel,There it is!
2240,Frydo,They's following us's.
2241,Zoidberg Head,"You know, you talk like that, it's gonna cost you points at a job interview."
2242,Frydo,What does it wants?
2243,Zoidberg Head,"First of all, I resent being called ""it."" I prefer jerkhole or simply  Second, I thought I could help you destroy the die, maybe."
2244,Frydo,"Yes, yes, please help me. The die is tearing me apart.  No, it's not. We're having a nice time.  Shut up.  You shut up.  S'all right?  Who's a s'all right?  Help me!"
2245,Swamp Hag,"Get out of my swamp, you kids!"
2246,URL,"Now, before your audience with the king, there's a shocking fact you best know about him."
2247,Titanius Anglesmith,Enough blabbety-blab! Open the doors.
2248,Roberto,"What, ho?"
2249,Titanius Anglesmith,"We bring ill tidings, o fanciest of men. Momon's reach nears the die of power. And should she obtain it, she will then have the entire basic set. Rivers will run red with blood and yellow with urine. And a dog will be seen eating cat food in the land. Oh, great king, your army is the last hope of Cornwood. Let us join forces before the light of good is extinguished forever."
2250,Roberto,You calling me crazy? Just 'cause I've got a hotel in my foot don't make me a boogalee-moogalee-moogalee.
2251,Titanius Anglesmith,Pardon?
2252,Roberto,"Stop laughing at me, flying avocado!"
2253,Titanius Anglesmith,Uh... moving along then. As the only nobleman present who's not...  ...I hereby place myself in command of the royal army.
2254,URL,What royal army would that be?
2255,Greyfarn,What?
2256,Smitty,King went insane and declared war on the scallops. Tied his army to a boulder and pushed them into the sea. They never returned.
2257,URL,Scallops must've got them. Greyfarn
2258,Titanius Anglesmith,Methinks we be boned.
2259,Larius,Where's their army?
2260,Waltazar,Maybe they didn't hear the horn. Blow it again.
2261,Waltazar,All right. On three. One...
2262,Titanius Anglesmith,"Two, three! Greyfarn"
2263,Larius,"I knew it. I was right, Walt. It's hot oil."
2264,Titanius Anglesmith,Ow.
2265,Roberto,AHH! Boogalee-moogalee-moogalee!
2266,Man,Ow!
2267,Leegola,What does it mean?
2268,Female Centaur,'Tis as we feared. Evil will soon triumph over good.
2269,Hermaphrodite,Your friends face certain death. Followed by a disrespectful marionette show performed with their corpses.
2270,Leegola,No! We've got to do something.
2271,Hermaphrodite,"Believe me, we will. We've taken out a sternly worded ad in tomorrow's Cornwood Times. Leegola"
2272,Hermaphrodite,"Well, Leegola, if you have a better idea, perhaps you'd like to challenge me to debate."
2273,Frydo,I'm too exhausted. I can't go on.
2274,Zoidberg Head,"I'm here for you, my friend. I'll drag you onward. Even to my last ounce of strength. Grab onto my testicles."
2275,Frydo,"You know, I think maybe I can walk after all."
2276,'Momon,That's not Wipe Castle.  The dodeca-call is coming from inside the house.
2277,Zoidberg Head,"What are you waiting for, Frydo? Throw it already in the boiling plastic."
2278,Frydo,I would. But...  Me's enjoys owning it.
2279,Zoidberg Head,Stop talking like that. It gives me anxiety. Frydo
2280,Momon,No!
2281,Die of Power,Twelve.
2282,Frydo,"So, it's all come down to this. A dungeon and dragons."
2283,Zoidberg Head,I didn't see it coming.
2284,Ogres,"Eat the wizard, eat the slut. Eat the robot's shiny butt"
2285,Gynecaladriel,"Well, at least we'll be remembered in song."
2286,Titanius Anglesmith,"Wait a second. I have an idea. I surrender. Here, eat my friends. Just give me one more second of sweet, sweet life.  Well, that worked out pretty good, eh, fellows?"
2287,Leegola,"Prepare to fire again, brave cowards."
2288,Hermaphrodite,"I still say, I won the debate. Leegola"
2289,Ogre,Wuh-woah.
2290,Remaining Ogre,Whew!
2291,Gynecaladriel,"Leegola, you saved us. How can I ever repay you? Greyfarn"
2292,Titanius Anglesmith,Can it wait a couple of minutes?
2293,Greyfarn,"Yes. Yes, it can."
2294,Frydo,You are no match for my dragon style.  I guess you are a match for my dragon style.
2295,Momon,"Tell me, Frydo, are you aware that a dragon's one weakness is its soft underbelly?"
2296,Frydo,No. Why do you... Leegola
2297,Titanius Anglesmith,"It is all over, Momon. We'll soon be down there defeating you. And it's all thanks to the existence of this fragile staircase.  Whoa!"
2298,Ignus,Quick. Get on the magic bug.
2299,Greyfarn,"It's not a magic bug, you dope. It's a magic arachnid. Can't you count the legs?"
2300,Ignus,No.
2301,Greyfarn,"Six, seven, eight. Not six, eight. I'll kill you, you imbecile."
2302,Momon,My underbelly. My one weakness.
2303,Zoidberg Head,"I got it. Now I can throw it in the hot thing over there and be the hero. On the other hand, infinite power might be nice."
2304,Ignus,"Please, I'm trying to help you."
2305,Greyfarn,Then why are you hitting me with a stick? How stupid are you that you think that's helping?
2306,Ignus,Mommy never told you about my father.
2307,Greyfarn,She said he was a foul He-demon.
2308,Ignus,Exactly.  You are my father.
2309,Greyfarn,"No. No, that's impossible."
2310,Ignus,Search your feelings. You know it to be true.
2311,Greyfarn,No! Ignus
2312,Zoidberg Head,
2313,Frydo,No! No!
2314,Mom,What happened?
2315,Leela,"My God, we're out of that weird, crazy world and back in our regular crazy world."
2316,Fry,Did we all just have some kind of freaky dream or was it ghosts?
2317,Farnsworth,"Neither, Fry. It was science. Bender's mighty imagination amplified by a dark matter resonance created an alternate reality that very nearly blew our minds."
2318,Hermes,Exactly. You can't make that kind of stuff up.
2319,Mom,"Quit trying to explain everything. I defeated you in that world and I'll defeat you in this one. Boys, the crystal’s still in his stomach."
2320,Walt,Commencing intestinal flash flood.
2321,Farnsworth,"Wait! Before my moment of shame, can I..."
2322,Mom,"Yes, speak up."
2323,Farnsworth,Can I give my boy a hug?
2324,Mom,All right. Fine. I've never done it. I guess somebody should.
2325,Inger,Daddy. Farnsworth
2326,Igner,We both eated the crysals. Mom
2327,Mom,My dark matter. It's worthless.
2328,Farnsworth,"That's right, Mom. But fear not, fancy folk for I've just thunk up an alternative energy source. Nibbler-power."
2329,Nibbler,Hurray. Wait. What?
2330,Farnsworth,Mush! Mush! Bender
2331,Farnsworth,"Faster, Garry Gygax"
2332,Seth MacFarlane,"You and I will be reborn,In a future place and time,If everything our Hindu brethren say is true.In an age of things that hover,You and I will still be lovers,And we'll say to ourselvesThat was then and this is, too.'Cause we'll still find the happening hot spots,We'll still cruise the cool casinos.You'll still fly me to the moon,Although the moon to which you fly me,Could be Phobos or Deimos.The psychic worms from Rigel Nine,Who control everything we do,Will make us think that was then,And 3010 is exactly the same as 1962.Don't expect any changes, my friend,That was then and this is, too."
2333,Bender,"Wow, Mars Vegas.  Long live the eternal city."
2334,Mr. Wong,"Two, one, zero!"
2335,Bender,"Rest in hell, Crapville!"
2336,Mrs. Wong,"Out here in the desert, we’re gonna build bigger, better Vegas."
2337,Mr. Wong,"Bathtubs size of oceans, hookers size of bouncers."
2338,Bender,Hamburger!
2339,Worm Announcer,Stand clear of the closing jaws.
2340,Bender,"Yo, you need any girders bent, I know a guy."
2341,Amy Wong,"So what's gonna be over there, Dad?"
2342,Mr. Wong,"That? That the oasis.  Take that, you stupid Mother Nature."
2343,Frida Waterfall,Okay. Let's hit him hard.
2344,Feministas,This land is your land.  This land is my land
2345,Fry,Who are you noisy women?
2346,Frida,"I'm Frida Waterfall, leader of the Greenorita Eco-Feminist Collective, and we will not let you man-doze this beautiful gyno-desert."
2347,Mr. Wong,"Well, I'm Leo Wong, and I say, ""Boom!"""
2348,Frida,"Hey, what happened to my femi-necklace?  And where's my mega-fem?"
2349,Professor Farnsworth,"Is he badly hurt, Dr. Zoidberg?"
2350,Zoidberg,I don't quite know how to say this.  Fry is dead!
2351,Zoidberg,"Wait, not dead.  The other thing."
2352,Mr. Wong,Damn eco-broads!  You can't even spray for eagles without upsetting these kooks.
2353,Leela,"Now, hang on.  Before you do construction, don't you have to make sure you're not harming any native species?"
2354,Mr. Wong,"You mean, cursory environmental survey?  Already done! By top scientist."
2355,Farnsworth,"Err, what?  Oh, my, yes.  You've got the go-ahead, Mr. Wong.  This place is deader than last year's cat."
2356,Leela,"No, it's not!  There's precious life right here in this scum puddle."
2357,Farnsworth,"Ah!  Cyprinodon martius.  The desert muck leech.  Amazingly, the entire species lives in this one tiny stink hole.   Killing these will be so much easier than exterminating those ponies."
2358,Leela,"Wait a second.  Leeches may not be cuddly like pandas or tribbles, but these poor endangered creatures deserve..."
2359,Bender,I'll get it with my trusty foot cups
2360,Leela,"No, don't kill it! We have to..."
2361,Mr. Wong,There. They're not endangered anymore. They're extinct.
2362,Leela,"No, they're not. I saved this one. And I'm gonna raise it and care for it, so the world will forever know what it's lost.   Mother-. Let go of me, you...    Poor thing."
2363,Mr. Wong,"Tell you what, Fry. You all promise not to sue me, I give you token for free entry in poker tournament.  He took it, you all saw it!"
2364,Bender,"Maybe we did, maybe we didn't.   What's in it for me, Bender?"
2365,Mr. Wong,"Okay, okay. Come back when New Vegas opens, I give you all free rooms, free dinner and free tickets to Céline Dion."
2366,Bender,Lose the Céline Dion tickets and you got yourself a deal.
2367,Mr. Wong,"All right, damnit, done!"
2368,Bender,"All right, I scored."
2369,Zoidberg,"Look out, Vegas, I've got a system.  Oh. I'm bankrupt."
2370,Fry,"You said it, Hermes. He is pathetic, but lovable."
2371,Hermes,"Yup. What? I said no such thing, mon."
2372,Fry,"I am not acting weird, Leela. Why is everyone talking at once?"
2373,Leela,"Fry, calm down and stop braining."
2374,Amy,"Yeah, Fry, maybe you need to-"
2375,Fry,"You're right, Amy! Maybe I do need some fresh air."
2376,Bender,"Man, I'm worried about him. But not enough to stop gambling for even a single second."
2377,Three Leos on the Machine,"You win, damnit!"
2378,Bender,
2379,Fry,Voices always yelling. Who - who said that? I'm not insane. Stop it. Stop talking in me!
2380,Hutch Waterfall,"Voices bothering you, man? I've been there. You need one of these doodangs."
2381,Fry,"A foil hat? Of course, he likes pastrami. What about the dog's testicles?  Hey, it worked. The voices stopped."
2382,Hutch,They've got a huge selection of carburetors... Hang on. Hang on.  That's better. My name's Hutch.
2383,Fry,"Hi, Hutch. So what's with the obnoxious, shrieking voices? Are my fillings picking up The View?"
2384,Hutch,"No, man. Truth is, it's other people's thoughts. You're a mind reader."
2385,Fry,"Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Although, actually, it was sort of obvious."
2386,Hutch,You don't believe me? Take off the helmet.
2387,Fry,I believe you.
2388,Hutch,"Seriously, do it."
2389,Fry,Loud and clear.
2390,Hutch,What?
2391,Fry,"I said, ""Loud and clear."" Only I said it with my thinker, not my talker."
2392,Hutch,Whoa! Freaky. Why can't I read your thoughts?
2393,Fry,I don't know. Wait. What's that about a secret society?
2394,Hutch,"Never mind that. Just keep the foil on and you'll be okay. Also, it'll keep the Dark Ones from incinerating your brain."
2395,Fry,That's a plus.
2396,Hutch,"And don't ever, ever, ever tell anyone you can read minds, or the Dark Ones will get you like that."
2397,Clamps,"Jeez, get a load of the batteries on her. I'd like to get my clamps on those. Give her a jump, you know what I mean?"
2398,Donbot,"Whoa, whoa. Show some decorum there, Clamps. This ain't no strip show. This is a beguiling display of the pornographic arts."
2399,Joey Mousepad,"Yo, Skip, I can see a guy's butt."
2400,Michael's Wife,"Oh, Michael, this is the perfect end to a perfect honeymoon."
2401,Michael,I love you so much.
2402,Bender,Is this seat taken?
2403,Michael,"Actually, we..."
2404,Bender,Slide me those chicken wings. So what part of Podunk you rubes from?
2405,Michael,The north-eastern.
2406,Announcer,"Monsieurs et mademoiselles, our circus of the senses now arrives by steamboat in New Orleans, circa 2873. The muted lament of a trombone resonates through the fog, which lingers even now, months after the attack of the fog monster. With but one hope of restoring Gearoticus to his throne, our sensual fate rests in the gyrations of... Fanny."
2407,Bender,Oh.
2408,Fanny,Yes?
2409,Bender,I'm Bender. Let's do it.
2410,Donbot,"Who is it, the Feds?"
2411,Bender,"Aren't you the Donbot, head of the Robot Mafia?"
2412,Donbot,"Allegedly. And this is my beloved wife, Fanny, whose honor I would proudly defend with a power drill. Well, I gotta go drown a stoolie."
2413,Donbot,"I'm gonna be in here a while, so do me a favor and drive my wife home. It's one of them self-driving cars, so just sit in the back and do whatever."
2414,Fanny,"Oh, Bender, your lips are intoxicating. It's like kissing an ashtray full of hot wings."
2415,Bender,Aww yeahh!
2416,Fry,"My God, I really can read minds. I have a superpower! There must be something great I can do with this."
2417,Fry,"Hello, ladies, I can read your thoughts.  Oh, wait, that's invisibility."
2418,Fry,"Poker. With my mind-reading abilities and my invisibility... Wait, no, just the mind reading. I can't lose!"
2419,Fry,"Sign me up for the tournament, please."
2420,Administrator,"Okey-doke, Jiffy Pop. Entry fee's 50,000 smackers."
2421,Fry,"50,000? Drat, all I have is my life savings and a token for free admission to this poker tournament."
2422,Administrator,Close enough.
2423,Amy,You're having an affair with the head of the robot mafia's wife?
2424,Bender,"Yup, this is her I'm making out with."
2425,Hermes,"Bender, are you crazy?"
2426,Bender,"No, it's Fry who's crazy in this one."
2427,Fry,"Psht, I'm not crazy."
2428,Leela,"You sure you're okay, Fry? I mean, you do have tin foil on your head."
2429,Fry,"So? You've got a leech on your neck. Oh, and speaking of sucking on your neck, want to go to a movie later?"
2430,Elzar,"Hey, there! How are you folks doing tonight?"
2431,Bender,Great. What are the specials?
2432,Elzar,"Well, let's see now. We've got a wonderful grizzly bear that's been dipped in cornmeal and lightly tormented. Questions?"
2433,Amy,What was the bear's name?
2434,Elzar,Jojo.
2435,Amy,"Ooh, I'll have him."
2436,Bender,Hide me!
2437,Joey Mousepad,"Hey, Donbot, ain't that your wife what with you had that wedding with?"
2438,Fanny,"Donbot, honey! What a pleasant shock! I was just having dinner alone, when suddenly you walk in on us."
2439,Donbot,"Alone, huh?"
2440,Bender,"Where am I? I was exploring a wormhole through space many light years from this restaurant, when suddenly I was surrounded by darkness.  Hot, sexy darkness.  I'm Bender. The world's most sexual robot. I mean, the world's most boundary-respecting robot."
2441,Donbot,"Nice to see you, Bender. Welcome back to our universe. Listen, sugar, I stuck up the Burlington Coat Factory and got you a little something. It's a $49 value."
2442,Danny,"Donbot, I love you!  Not really."
2443,Bender,"Man, this is great! I always wanted to nail a dame in a fur coat, and now's my chance.  I mean, if you'll introduce me to one, sir.  One as sexy as you, baby! Bender out."
2444,Fanny,"I never felt so alive, Bender. Listen, this turquoise-encrusted bra is worth 50 grand. Let's sell it and run off before the Donbot gets wise."
2445,Bender,No. It will take a lot more money than that to make a girl like you happy.
2446,Fanny,"No, it won't."
2447,Bender,"Yeah, it will. Shut up! We'll run off, but not till after I win the Universal Poker Championship!  One entry, please."
2448,Fanny,"Bender, no! You can't beat the best players in the universe. You're not lucky enough."
2449,Bender,"Oh, no? I'm 40% lucky.  The scrap metal I'm made from included a truckload of horseshoes from the luckiest racehorses in Mexico, who had just been sent to a glue factory."
2450,Fanny,They don't sound so lucky to me.
2451,Bender,Not without their shoes.
2452,Fanny,"Here, Bendy, take this. It will give you 70% more luck. It's the Donbot's lucky robot's foot."
2453,Bender,"All right! With two kinds of luck, I can't lose.   No, wait, three. I stepped on a leprechaun."
2454,Joey Mousepad,"Yo, you see this over here over there?"
2455,Clamps,I'm powering up the clamps.
2456,Donbot,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. Let us not rush to judgment."
2457,Joey Mousepad,"But, Skip, that was your lucky robot's foot what came off of your lucky leg."
2458,Donbot,"While it is true that I did wake up with only one foot this morning, there is no proof that my beloved Fanny was involved. Aside from the hacksaw I found under her pillow."
2459,Clamps,"Well, what about that Bender guy? You want I should give him the clamps?"
2460,Donbot,"Not yet, Clamps. Only one thing can prove that he has my lucky foot."
2461,Clamps,Torture with the clamps or a clamp-like device?
2462,Donbot,"No. We are gonna sit tight and see if he wins the poker tournament. He does, that proves he's packing my lucky foot, in which event..."
2463,Clamps,The clamps! Or a clamp-like device.
2464,Penn Jillette,Welcome viewers who fell asleep with the TV on! It's the 3009 no-limit hold 'em championship.  Our act really didn't change much when he died.
2465,Bender,"Pardon me, I'm new to this game. Is this duffle bag big enough for all your money?"
2466,Fry,"Bender? Oh, boogers. We're in the same tournament. Quick, get your entry fee back before I bankrupt you."
2467,Bender,"Pfft! In your dreams, nutloaf."
2468,Fry,Bite my shiny metal hat.
2469,Penn Jillette,"Tex Connecticut, the pride of Kansas City, first to act."
2470,Bender,Woo! Two aces. I'm thinking guitar solo.
2471,Fry,He puts his hat back down.] I fold.
2472,Penn Jillette,Holy crap! A stunning play by mentally ill newcomer Philip Fry. It's almost as if he knew Bender had two aces.
2473,'Boobs Vanderbilt,Bender has two aces? I'm out.
2474,Tex Connecticut,I'm out.
2475,Lrrr,I'm out.
2476,Bender,Suck my luck!
2477,Donbot,See this gun?  That's what I'm gonna do to Bender if he wins.
2478,Lrrr,All in. Call my mighty bid at your peril.
2479,Fry,I call your bluff.
2480,Lrrr,I shall annihilate... Fry hugs him.]  I just wanted to make my daddy proud.
2481,Lrrr's Father,"Well, you didn't. I want you and your junk moved out by Monday."
2482,Penn Jillette,"It's getting pretty intense, folks. Based on the state of decomposition of Teller's head, we're now in hour 19 of the tournament. And the first bad deal of the night for Bender."
2483,Bender,"Hey, pal, help me out here.  This is the worst possible hand, right?"
2484,Tex Connecticut,I'm all in.
2485,Bender,"All in! I mean, fold. Whatever."
2486,Penn Jillette,"Well, Bender's luck just ran out. No card can save him from elimination."
2487,Boobs Vanderbilt,"Oh, my gourds! He's dead."
2488,Leo Wong,"21, winner!"
2489,Bender,"Wooo! I'm so full of luck, it's shooting out like luck diarrhoea."
2490,Penn Jillette,"Wake up, poker fans! We're down to our final two players in heads-up action for the Championship. Your perspective, Teller?"
2491,Bender,All in.
2492,Fry,"But-but, you didn't even look at your cards!"
2493,Bender,Looking at one's cards is a crutch for players who rely on skill.
2494,Leo Wong,"Any day now, Fry. You in or out?"
2495,Bender,"What's the matter, Fry, you scared? Or just"
2496,Fry,"All right, all in.  Yes! Four aces!"
2497,Bender,"Ah-ah-ah. Read 'em and weep, and then tell me what they are."
2498,Leo Wong,"Two kings. And with three on the board, that gives Bender five kings."
2499,Fry,But how is that...
2500,Penn Jillette,"I don't believe it. Bender has just been dealt the King of Beers, a coaster from the bar that somehow got mixed into the deck. But it still counts!"
2501,Leo Wong,Bender win the Championship!
2502,Bender,
2503,Fanny,"You did it, Bender. You're the greatest."
2504,Bender,"Tell me something I don't know, sweetass. Now, let's boogie. We'll be in Space Tahiti before the Donbot knows what hit him."
2505,Donbot,Now I am suspicious.
2506,Bender,"Okay, we finished digging this shallow grave. Can we go now?"
2507,Fry,Poor Bender left me one last voicemail before the Robot Mafia buried him in the desert.
2508,Bender,"Fry, old friend, before I die, I just wanted to say..."
2509,Hermes,"Line up, people! Everyone take a shovel and one sixth of the planet. We'll meet back here in 50 years, our bodies broken and our lives wasted."
2510,Zoidberg,And you say these are free shovels?
2511,Bender,"I'm back, baby."
2512,Fry,Bender! I thought the Robot Mafia killed you.
2513,Bender,"Nah, they just shot us and buried us a few times as a warning."
2514,Fanny,Bender was so brave. He never stopped making out with me the whole time they were shooting us.
2515,Bender,I sure didn't.
2516,Fanny,"I gotta get back to my husband, baby. Will I see you tonight?"
2517,Bender,Probably not.
2518,Mr. Wong,"It's a 14-footer with a clown hazard. What club you recommend, Baggy?"
2519,Baggy,"As on every hole, I suggest the putter."
2520,Fry,"Your golf club sure is classy, Mr. Wong. Naked statue classy."
2521,Leela,It is very nice. I just wish Amy and I didn't have to wear these sexist badges on our melons.
2522,Amy,"We're lucky even to play as guests, Leela. Dad's club has a very strict ""No girls allowed"" policy."
2523,Leela,That doesn't seem fair.
2524,Amy,It really is. Everybody knows women don't have the focus to play miniature golf at a professional level.
2525,Leela,But that's the best shot of the day!
2526,Mr. Wong,Is that my ball? I think that my ball.
2527,Amy,"Pfft, great putt, Dad."
2528,Mr. Wong,"Okay, we're done."
2529,Leela,"Mr. Wong, how do you keep this place so green in the middle of the desert? Doesn't that waste a lot of water?"
2530,Mr. Wong,"Nah, we got plenty water, pumped directly from flamingo lake."
2531,Mr. Wong,"Oh, yeah, I love miniature golf. Love everything about it, except how damn miniature it is. That's why I'm building the universe's biggest miniature golf course."
2532,Mr. Wong,This the first tee.
2533,Fry,Where's the hole?
2534,Mr. Wong,"On Pluto's moon, Hydra. It's a six-billion-mile par-two. Tough shot, even for a man."
2535,Amy,Two.
2536,Mr. Wong,"Keep in mind, that just the first hole. For full course, we gonna bulldoze this entire arm of the Milky Way."
2537,Leela,What? You're gonna wipe out 10% of the galaxy for a stupid golf course?
2538,Mr. Wong,"First of all, it 12% . Second, yes, you betcha."
2539,Leela,But you have no idea what life forms might be evolving out there.
2540,Mr. Wong,That's exactly why I'm hiring an impartial scientist to perform an environmental survey. That's him in the money shower.
2541,Fry,"Delivery boy's log. Having fallen asleep on what I thought was the toilet, I awoke to find the environmental survey in progress."
2542,Farnsworth,"Status reports, Science Officer."
2543,Bender,Zilcho. No sign of life or intelligence.
2544,Fry,Hey!
2545,Leela,"Okay, so we haven't found any life yet. I still don't see why you men can't be happy with regular-sized miniature golf."
2546,Farnsworth,"Leela, evolution has programmed our fabulous male brains to take anything anybody else thinks is important and make it bigger.  Have you seen my new 301-inch TV?"
2547,Announcer,Hypnotoad is brought to you by the MagnaPhallix 302-inch TV. It's bigger!
2548,Farnsworth,"Oh, hell!"
2549,Bender,"Captain, I'm detecting life on the Spock-o-scope!"
2550,Leela,It's amazing. It's like a textbook on evolution.
2551,Fry,Except in Kansas.
2552,Bender,But isn't Mr. Wong building the 18th hole here? And the golf pants museum?
2553,Farnsworth,Indeed so. This whole area will be incinerated when he implodes that sun there into a black hole.
2554,Leela,That beautiful violet star?
2555,Farnsworth,It's so you can't keep your ball at the end of the game.
2556,Fry,"Yo, that's messed up."
2557,Leela,"Well, there won't be any imploding once they read our environmental review. Right, Professor?"
2558,Farnsworth,"Ohh, twaddle-squat. There's no scientific consensus that life is important."
2559,Bender,"Yeah. Life, schmife."
2560,Clip Board,Approved for demolition.
2561,Leela,"It's you and me, ponytail."
2562,Guard,"We're here, Mr. President."
2563,Richard Nixon's head,Arroo! Let's play some mini-golf.
2564,Nixon,"Now, just give it a light tap, Agnew.  No, no, no, just a light..."
2565,Zoidberg,"Now for a triple clam dip, with a double -  OW!"
2566,Nixon,"Tough luck, Agnew. Looks like you and Wong owe me a Charleston Chew."
2567,Feministas,Shut up and hear our wisdom. Save the ecosystem. Shut up and hear our wisdom! Save the ecosystem!
2568,Nixon,"What gives, Wong? You said no chicks allowed."
2569,Frida,"We are the Greenorita Eco-Feminist Collective, and we will not let you...What was it again?"
2570,Leela,"We will not let you implode the violet dwarf star at galactic coordinates 167.84, -58.03, mark 948."
2571,Mr. Wong,"Already approved, you cackling hens. So get out, or I'll have vice-president Agnew's headless body throw you out."
2572,Leela,I'd like to see him try.
2573,Nixon,"Me, too. Should look funny. Sic 'em, Agnew."
2574,Nixon,Runaway golf cart!
2575,Leela,"Look out, Agnew!"
2576,Nixon,Whoa!
2577,Mr. Wong,Aah!
2578,Leela,Is... is he okay?
2579,Mr. Wong,No pulse.
2580,Nixon,They killed the headless remains of Agnew. Arrest them!
2581,Frida,"All Feministas she-vacuate the premises. I mean ""femises."""
2582,Nixon,"My fellow Earthicans, these eco-crooks will face the maximum sentence. For killing a headless torso, that's six weeks."
2583,Bender,"Well, this is embarrassing. Here I've been blabbing on for years about killing all humans, and who actually does something about it? Some chick."
2584,Fry,"Leela's not a killer, and she's not some chick. She's the chick I love. And don't tell her I called her a chick, or she'll kill me."
2585,Frida,Everyone stay absolutely quiet!
2586,Feminista,That thing's on. Shh!
2587,Feminista,Turn it off!
2588,Frida,"Oh, sorry."
2589,Frida,How do you turn it off?
2590,Frida,There. Did that do it?
2591,OTHERS,No. Stop it. Shut up.
2592,Frida,Here's the button here.
2593,Leela,Let me give you a hand.
2594,Frida,This is awful. I never meant for our protest to have any effect. Now what do we do?
2595,Trixie,Maybe we should just surrender and serve our six weeks in jail.
2596,Dixie,"Hey, yeah! We could do each other's toenails and make shivs."
2597,Leela,"That's crazy. We've done nothing wrong, other than killing and dismembering the vice-president. We need to make a choice, sisters. We can either keep pestering criminals like Leo Wong with silly slogans..."
2598,ALL,Yeah. Let's do that.
2599,Leela,"Actually, I meant that to be the less preferable alternative. We can either chant slogans or we can take action."
2600,Dixie,What was the first choice again?
2601,Leela,I choose to save the environment by sabotaging Leo Wong's golf course. Who's with me?
2602,Frida,Could we still use our bullhorns?
2603,Leela,Absolutely. Bullhorns are a core principle of eco-feminism.
2604,Frida,Then I'm in.
2605,Leela,Who's ready to kick some sweaty man-butt?
2606,Dixie,I've got my pointy man-kicking shoes on.
2607,Trixie,Those are cute.
2608,Dixie,Aren't they? I got them at Nine West.
2609,Leela,"Simmer down, warriors. Full power to the vagyroscope!"
2610,Mr. Wong,"Those dirty rings. I tried soaking them out, even blasting them out."
2611,Frida,Are you sure about this? It would be better for propaganda if we weren't using refined sugar.
2612,Leela,It's okay. The potato we're shoving in the tailpipe is organic.
2613,Mr. Wong,"I smell sabotage.  Ooh, and potatoes."
2614,Leela,"Now, unfortunately, the media is going to put a negative spin on this, like when we killed that guy, so to win public support, we'll need a lovable mascot."
2615,Zoidberg,
2616,Leela,Zoidberg?
2617,Zoidberg,Leela. Me saving things the leech. Not the eating of it.
2618,Leela,"Zoidberg, I'm very surprised at you, slightly."
2619,Fry,Psst! Leela.
2620,Leela,Shh! I'm a fugitive.
2621,Fry,"I know. I miss you so much, Leela, even more than when you were here."
2622,Leela,"I miss you, too, Fry. And you probably think what I'm doing is wrong. But it's something I really care about..."
2623,Fry,"You don't have to explain, Leela. You're you. That's all I need to know."
2624,Leela,"Goodbye, sweet goofbag."
2625,Bender,
2626,Zoidberg,Dibs on her- ohh...
2627,Hutch,"Hey, Fry! Long time, man."
2628,Fry,"Hey, Hutch! What have you been up to?"
2629,Hutch,"Same old, same old. Searching the dumpsters, protecting my thoughts with tin foil, peeing myself."
2630,Fry,"So, what brings you to Earth?"
2631,Hutch,"It's top secret. Hey, take off your helmet and I'll think it to you."
2632,Fry,Okay. Here goes.
2633,Fry,Where are you? And me?
2634,Hutch,"The Great Hall of the Ancient Legion of Madfellows. Welcome, bro."
2635,ALL,"Welcome, bro."
2636,Hutch,"Sorry I bashed your head in, buddy, but I had to. You see, the fate of the universe depends on you."
2637,Fry,"Yeah, I get that a lot."
2638,Hutch,The Grand Curator will tell you more.
2639,Fry,Take me to him.
2640,Nine,"Hey, man."
2641,Fry,Hey.
2642,Nine,"So dig this, Fry. Our commune has been monitoring the universe's life energy for, like, a really long time, and we're grokking some super weird junk."
2643,Fry,"Um, I don't mean to be rude, but it's kind of hard to take you seriously when you say junk like ""grok"" and ""junk."""
2644,Nine,"What about ""commune""?"
2645,Fry,"Especially ""commune."" Come on, it's the fate of the universe, puff it up a little. Like you could say your ancient order is sensing deep upheaval in the cosmic life energy field."
2646,Nine,"Okay. I'll try. So, like, a really, really long time ago...  The Green Chi generated a great upwelling of life across the cosmos. But then, for reasons unknown..."
2647,Fry,"Ooh. ""Reasons unknown."" Now that's the sort of hook that grabs the attention of me, the viewer."
2648,Nine,For reasons unknown...
2649,Fry,Nice.
2650,Nine,"...the Chi began to recede, and the diversity of life began to wither. The life forms we know today are but a fraction of a fraction of the magnificence that once existed."
2651,Hutch,"But a bunch of dudes, right, they totally passed this far-out knowledge down through the ages."
2652,Nine,"Some with this knowledge were called prophets, some, fruitcakes. We, the Legion of Madfellows, are their heirs."
2653,Fry,"Hey, I'm on TV."
2654,Nine,"Well, that's the show."
2655,Fry,Neat. What's it got to do with me?
2656,Nine,"Ahh, pooperdoodle! I mean, pardon the omission. You see, after untold eternities, we have sensed a resurgence in the Chi."
2657,Fry,"Hey, that's the violet dwarf star that Leela wants to save."
2658,Hutch,"Freaking nailed it, corndog."
2659,Nine,"We believe this star heralds a new green age, and it's your destiny to be its shepherd and protector."
2660,Fry,Me? Why?
2661,Hutch,"'Cause you got, like, no delta brainwave, man. The Dark Ones can't groove off your thoughts."
2662,Nine,"Silence, Hutch! You shall learn more in time, Fry. But for now, let's just say we have enemies, enemies who can read minds, except yours."
2663,Fry,Cool. I can't wait to tell Leela.
2664,Nine,"No! If you tell anyone, then their thoughts could be read, and our enemies would know of our existence. For the sake of those you love, you must keep this secret. Do you foot-swear?"
2665,Fry,"Oh, okay. I foot-swear."
2666,Nine,"Good. Now, to save the coming of the green age, you must stop this man."
2667,Fry,I know him. Leo Wong. I work with his daughter.
2668,Nine,"Oh, good, that will cut about 15 minutes of explanation. You must gain Wong's confidence, infiltrate his organization and prevent him from destroying the violet dwarf."
2669,Mr. Wong,"Looking for a job, eh?"
2670,Fry,"Yes, sir. Nothing fancy. I'm willing to start at the bottom and infiltrate my way up."
2671,'Mr. Wong,"Sorry, no openings right now."
2672,Fry,I'm good at keeping nutcases.
2673,Mr. Wong,I said no way.
2674,Fry,I look like an idiot who can handle those feministas.
2675,Mr Wong,He'll have to do better than that.
2676,Fry,I'll have to do better than that.
2677,Mr. Wong,Hmm. You and I think a lot alike. You really think you can stand up to those eco-freakos?
2678,Fry,"Sir, with me around, they'll be the least of your worries."
2679,Tester,"Stand by, men. And manly aliens. Prepare to test fire King Kong hole."
2680,Sal,It workses.
2681,Tester,"Good job, men. And manly aliens. Construction of King Kong hole complete."
2682,Frida,"Typical. Always King Kong, never Queen... Quong."
2683,Sal,"What are those, hooks? Get out of heres, you hookers. This is my turfs."
2684,Sal,Helpses!
2685,Leela,"You go, gorilla !"
2686,Morbo,Our top story. The string of eco-vandalism that began with a harmless vice-presidential killing has spread across the galaxy.
2687,Linda,"Why do you always get to read the top story, Morbo?"
2688,Morbo,"Because viewers trust a deep male voice and huge, throbbing forehead veins."
2689,Linda,Not all reaction to the crime spree has been negative. We spoke with several people who viewed these courageous eco-feminists as heroes.
2690,Petunia,I just wish there was some way to... Excuse me.  Some way to show I support 'em. Send them some smokes or something.
2691,Linda,So you make more than twice what I do. What? This just in
2692,Leela,"This is sub-commander L., den mother of the Feminista Revolutionary Collective, with a message for Leo Wong. Leo, you're a parasite on the universe, and parasites must be destroyed. That's why we've adopted this parasite as our mascot."
2693,Morbo,In other news-
2694,Linda Mimicking the Feministas' actions],Feministas unite!
2695,Linda,Feministas unite!
2696,Nixon,Incredible. Absolutely incredible. You're telling me this TiVo machine can pause and rewind live TV?
2697,Mr. Wong,"These crazy broads gonna ruin me, Nixon. You gotta help me. Send the army or something. Something big that shoots."
2698,Nixon,"Sir, I don't care if you are my biggest contributor. Our armed forces do not serve your private business interests."
2699,Mr. Wong,"Sorry, I..."
2700,Nixon,"I'm just yanking your chain, Leo. I'm on it like boring on Gerry Ford."
2701,Zapp Brannigan,"Zapp Brannigan purporting for duty. For the love of God, Kif, less piccolo, more fife."
2702,Nixon,"Report, Brannigan."
2703,Zapp,"Mr. President, I failed to identify these curvaceous banditas despite hours of staring at their dossiers.  Yet, I seemed to have stroked myself upon good luck, for a patriot of the highest order has volunteered to lead us to them."
2704,Nixon,These eco-feminists are ruthless criminals who'll stop at nothing to save the environment. I don't see how a bending unit can catch them.
2705,Bender,"Not just any bending unit, Presidente. I happen to be brilliant, fearless and short on cash."
2706,Nixon,"Slush him, Kroker."
2707,Zapp,"Bender here has identified the femdito commander as my ex-lover, Turanga Leela, whom I once made love at."
2708,Nixon,And he's willing to fink her out for a few simoleons?
2709,Bender,"It's not about the money, Nixon, though I'd like much more. It's 'cause Leela's a threat. A threat to my reputation. She's committed 30 felonies in 12 star systems. If no one stops her, she'll break my record for longest rap sheet."
2710,Nixon,"That's a despicable motive, Bender, and I respect it."
2711,Bender,"Gracias. Now, I could find Leela, but you'll need to authorize a wiretap."
2712,Nixon,As many as you like.
2713,Bender,I only need one.
2714,Nixon,Let's call it six.
2715,Kif,"Question. If you don't know where Leela is, how can you wiretap her?"
2716,Bender,"I'm not wiretapping her, Greensleeves. You see, like all women, Leela has one weakness."
2717,Bender,"Hello, weakness!"
2718,Fry,"Hey, Bender, check it out. I'm Leo Wong's new security guard. I got an ID badge and a flashlight, and I ordered this mustache."
2719,Bender,"Neat. Say, speaking of whatever the hell you just said, I need to make a cell phone telephone call. Can borrow your cell phone telephone?"
2720,Fry,"Okay, but don't restart my Tetris. I was finally about to get one of those pieces that looks like a backwards ""L."""
2721,Bender,"Okay, superstud."
2722,Mr. Wong,"Looking good, security. No feministas getting past you."
2723,Fry,"No, sir. Not on my mustache's watch."
2724,Amy,"Fry, I can't believe you're working with my dad against Leela. How can you claim to be her friend and still want her in jail?"
2725,Fry,"It's a tightrope walk, I won't deny it. It takes the kind of multi-sided thinking your dad's so brilliant at."
2726,Amy,You mean being two-faced?
2727,Mr. Wong,Don't mind cranky-pants here. She been cranky ever since she was a fat little girl.
2728,Amy,Dad!
2729,Mr. Wong,"Can I be brutally honest, Fry? I always wanted a son."
2730,Fry,"That hurt, but I can take it."
2731,Amy,I knew you wanted a son! Why do you think I became a miniature golf champion? Why do you think I wear these stupid boys' sweat suits?
2732,Mr. Wong,"To hide your big, fat butt, that's why."
2733,Fry,"Now, sir, in fairness, Amy's butt is actually pretty hot."
2734,Amy,What is it with you men? Why does everything revolve around my butt?
2735,Mr. Wong,'Cause it's so big and massive.
2736,Fry,Sorry.
2737,Amy,That's it! Why don't you just adopt Fry and make him the son you never had? That'll replace the daughter you don't have anymore!
2738,Bender,Whoa! What's with Big Butt?
2739,Mr. Wong,She just hungry.
2740,Bender,"Here you go, Fry."
2741,Fry,Thanks.
2742,Bender,"Oh! FYI, I dropped that Tetris piece in the wrong place and ended the game."
2743,Fry,No!
2744,Fry,"Great! Now Amy's gonna tell Leela I'm a jerk. If only I could explain I'm on a secret mission against evil. Wait. Evil? Yeah, yeah, evil."
2745,Frida,Take your mands off of me!
2746,Fry,I'm on your side.
2747,Frida,Don't shush me.
2748,Fry,"Please, can you take a message to Leela?"
2749,Frida,What is it?
2750,Fry,"Just say her sweet goofbag is working to save the violet dwarf star, just like she is."
2751,Frida,"Very well, I'll fem-municate your man-formation."
2752,Fry,Just tell her.
2753,Farnsworth,"Well, this is it, old friends. Planet Express is done for, what with our delivery crew missing and the abysmal sales of Tickle Me Bender."
2754,Bender Doll,"Quit touching my junk, pervert!"
2755,Farnsworth,Hold out your hands and I'll remove your career chips.
2756,Zoidberg,I hate to see it come to an end.  When will it end?
2757,Hermes,"Shouldn't you get that, Professor?"
2758,Farnsworth,I suppose.  Hello?
2759,Mr. Wong,"Professor, old buddy, I'm gonna blow up the violet dwarf star. So I need you deliver billion-mile security fence to keep out protesters. Dirty business. Lot of money. You corrupt enough?"
2760,Farnsworth,"Damn skippy!  Good news, crybabies! We're back in business."
2761,Hermes,"Sweet kookaburra of Edinburgh, Professor. You sure you know how to fly this thing?"
2762,Farnsworth,"I invented it, didn't I? You wouldn't ask Thomas Edison whether he knew how to use a sexmatron."
2763,Zoidberg,"The Feministas, probably."
2764,Leela,Halt! What are you doing in this parallelogram of space?
2765,Farnsworth,We're delivering a fence to keep you ladies in your place.
2766,Zoidberg,Amy?
2767,Hermes,LaBarbara?
2768,LaBarbara,"That's right, husband. From now on, you make your own Manwiches."
2769,Leela,"Under the articles of the confemiracy, we hereby wo-mandeer this ship."
2770,Zoidberg,"Oh, no, you don't. It's three against three."
2771,Mrs. Wong,That was the greatest play I ever saw. It must have had 20 acts.
2772,Leela,"We installed your fence, Leo Wong."
2773,Linda,Should we shout a clever slogan?
2774,Leela,"You mean something like, ""The best defense is a good fence?"""
2775,Linda,"Yeah, something like that, only funny."
2776,Leela,"I wish we could, but our chief slogan writer is back at the Honeybun Hideout."
2777,Frida,"Does ""violet dwarf"" rhyme with ""men are dorks""? It does through a megaphone."
2778,"Mysterious, Sinister Voice","So, the Legion of Madfellows has a new pawn, eh?"
2779,Frida,"Is somebody here? If you're the DSL guy, you're two days late."
2780,"Mysterious, Sinister Voice",Who gave you that message for Leela?
2781,Frida,I don't know his name.
2782,"Mysterious, Sinister Voice",Then you are of no use to the Dark Ones!
2783,Frida,"Long lost brother, avenge my death."
2784,Mysterious Voice,"Where are your crappy rhymes now, Frida Waterfall?"
2785,Frida,I'm dead. I'm dead.
2786,Fry,"Six, seven, eight. Lock the gate. One, two, three. Turn the key. 30, 50, 10.  My dirty, shifty friend?"
2787,Hutch,"Hey, Fry, long time."
2788,Hutch,"Welcome back to the Legion of Madfellows, man."
2789,Fry,"Why'd you bonk me, you idiot? You could have just asked me to come with you. And where are we? This doesn't look like your regular dumpster."
2790,Nine,"All in good time! I guess now is a good time. We are on Mars, in a forgotten cavern abandoned by the native Martians a million years ago."
2791,Fry,"Actually, it was five years ago. I remember 'cause they washed my socks."
2792,Nine,"You have done well, Fry. You have ingratiated yourself with Leo Wong."
2793,Fry,"Yup, I kissed his ass from cheek to shining cheek. So, what do I do next?"
2794,Nine,"As Wong security chief, you will be on hand when he attempts to destroy the violet dwarf. You must not let that happen."
2795,Fry,"""Must let happen."""
2796,Nine,Not happen!
2797,Fry,"""Must let occur."""
2798,Nine,Let me tell you a story. A story of two alien species so ancient that compared to them the human race is a mere college senior! On a distant planetoid they evolved to cooperate in their quest to survive.
2799,Fry,"Cooperation, because life is a team sport."
2800,Nine,"But, over time, one species evolved a better strategy, and an evolutionary arms race began."
2801,Nine,That concludes the audio-visual portion of our head-clonk and lecture.
2802,Fry,"Wait, what happened to the snakes and the frogs? I need to know!"
2803,Nine,"The frogs, or possibly the snakes, evolved into vicious killing machines, honed by the merciless forces of natural selection and intelligent design. We call these the Dark Ones!"
2804,Nine,"These evil creatures preyed on all life, driving species after species to extinction. Meanwhile, however, the second species evolved to fend off the Dark Ones, befriending and protecting all other living things."
2805,Fry,Even Céline Dion?
2806,Nine,"Probably. We call these noble beings the Encyclopods, because their DNA incorporates the DNA of every endangered species they encountered, so they can recreate them if they go extinct."
2807,Fry,"Just as a pillow, a wig and a corncob pipe can be used to recreate my old girlfriend!"
2808,Nine,Bingo.
2809,Transition Announcer 2,"Meanwhile, at the Honeybun Hideout."
2810,LaBarbara,There! Now you know how it feels to be locked up in a go-go cage.
2811,Hermes,What the hell are you talking about?
2812,LaBarbara,Shut your man-hole.
2813,Hermes,I feel dirty.
2814,Leela,"Are you sure Fry is working for your father? It just doesn't seem like him to be so evil, or to hold down a job."
2815,Amy,"It's true, Leela. Cross My Heart bra and swear to Goddess."
2816,Leela,"But the Fry I know wouldn't do that. I'm gonna call his cell phone telephone and prove you wrong.   Oh, no! Frida's been murdered!"
2817,LaBarbara,Sweet she-cattle of Seattle!
2818,Hermes,"Not your strong suit, woman."
2819,Amy,Who could have done this?
2820,Leela,Your dad? Nixon?
2821,Amy,Fry?
2822,Leela,"No, never. I don't think. Anyhow, there's a crazed murderer on the loose, possibly in the shadows or hanging from the ceiling!  So just stay calm while I call Fry."
2823,Fry,So where are the Encyclopods and the Dark Ones now?
2824,Nine,"Wh-...  Many more died out, like the Encyclopods. But, and this is the great secret of our age, we believe they left an egg behind."
2825,Fry,Is it edible?
2826,Nine,"We're not gonna eat it! Not unless we find a second one. No, Fry, we intend to hatch it!"
2827,Hutch,And that's where you come in.
2828,Fry,And here I am.
2829,Nine,"At long last the tide of Chi has returned, and its nourishing flow has awakened the dormant egg."
2830,Fry,That's good.
2831,Hutch,"It's better than good. It's better. With its massive stash of DNA, the Encyclopod can reconstruct every species that ever went extinct."
2832,Nine,"Imagine, all the animals that failed evolution's test, alive again! The dodo bird, the brittle-klutz, the striped biologist-taunter."
2833,Fry,"So, where is this egg?"
2834,Nine,In the violet dwarf star system.
2835,Fry,And what does it look like?
2836,Nine,A violet dwarf star!
2837,Fry,"You mean, the whole star is a single... Whoa! Sci-fi."
2838,Nine,"Alas! Even now, a Dark One is headed to the star to ensure its destruction."
2839,Fry,Dang! So what does this Dark One look like?
2840,Nine,We don't know. I admit it's a horrifically grave situation.
2841,Hutch,"Don't sugarcoat it, Nine. The Dark Ones have been evolving so long, it could be anything or anyone. Or anybody."
2842,Fry,"You mean, like, people?"
2843,Hutch,"Any people. It will kill the egg, and every dude, woman and child who knows about it."
2844,Nine,"Even our crazy caps will be useless at close range. That's why only you, with your defective unreadable brainwave, may be able to thwart them and usher in a new green age of wonder and..."
2845,Fry,You're on Fry-time. Leela! Did you get my message?
2846,Leela,What message?
2847,Fry,Didn't you see Frida Waterfall?
2848,Leela,So you did kill Frida Waterfall?
2849,Fry,"What? No. I told her to tell you that I'm... Oh, Jeep! The Dark Ones got her. It's all true. We need to talk, Leela. Then I can explain...  Well, I can't explain anything, but we should talk anyway. Where are you?"
2850,Leela,"Oh, no. I'm not gonna expose the Honeybun Hideout. Where are you?"
2851,Fry,Near the Keeler Crater on Mars. Do you know it?
2852,Leela,"I, I, uh... I think I read about it."
2853,Leela,I'll meet you at the south rim in one hour. No moustaches.
2854,Zapp,"Kif, set coordinates, 36-24-36. AKA, Leela."
2855,Fry,Ten minutes late. Ain't that just like a womanista?
2856,Leela,Psst. Are you alone?
2857,Fry,"Of course, don't you trust me?"
2858,Zapp,"There's no escape, Leela. If you surrender, wave your shirt in the air."
2859,Leela,"Fry, you traitor!"
2860,Amy,"Hop onto the magnet, Leela!"
2861,Leela,"Okay. One, two..."
2862,Leela,"I can't believe you ratted me out, Fry."
2863,Fry,"I'm not a rat, I swear. If I'm any rodent, it's the loyal capybara, king of the rats! No, wait."
2864,Linda,"This just in, we are about to get our asses blown off. LaBarbara?"
2865,LaBarbara,"That's right, Linda."
2866,Amy,"Stay strong, ladies. We can lose them in the giant miniature golf course."
2867,Fry,But the course isn't finished. And there's no girls allowed.
2868,Amy,Fore!
2869,Zapp,"So, they want to play mini golf, eh? Two can play at that game. Or even four, depending on the number of ball colors available."
2870,Zapp,I choose pink.
2871,Kif,"That's their color, sir."
2872,Zapp,The hell it is.
2873,Leela,They're gaining on us. We need a birdie on the windmill hole.
2874,Amy,Wait. Wait. Drop the boot!
2875,Kif,"Sir, at our present speed, the computer predicts a 100% chance we'll be sliced in half. We'll never make it."
2876,Zapp,"Not with that attitude, we won't. Same speed ahead!"
2877,Zapp,"We made it through, Kif. How many men did we lose?"
2878,Kif,All of them.
2879,Zapp,"Well, at least they won't have to mourn each other. Seal the airlocks, and draw the shades. Resume shooting."
2880,Fry,"Oh, no! The gorilla! That's a par-four!"
2881,Leela,The mouth's too dangerous. I'm going for the nose.
2882,Amy,Don't be a sucker. You won't come out anywhere near the hole. You need to aim for the jaws just when they start to close.
2883,Leela,Start to close? Are you out of your...
2884,Leela,We made it!
2885,Zapp,Captaining 101 . Go for the nose.
2886,Bender,My arms are broken. I'll never paint again.
2887,Kif,You can't sue the military.
2888,Bender,I'm okay then.
2889,Zapp,Damage report.
2890,Kif,"We lost all remaining food and oxygen, Captain. As well as our XM Radio antenna."
2891,Zapp,"Then this chase is over. Kif, set course for the nearest XM repair facility. Meanwhile, we shall sing top hits from the '80s."
2892,Kif,"Which '80s, sir?"
2893,Zapp,"For me, there are only one '80s."
2894,Hermes,The shot was too good! We're jamming straight for the hole.
2895,Zoidberg,"We're gonna crash, even."
2896,Amy,"Shmeesh, shmell out, shmeverybody. It's a wormhole hole."
2897,Farnsworth,"Of course, a wormhole! We'll simply disappear and reappear in a...  ...nother part of the universe."
2898,Amy,We made it!
2899,Farnsworth,"Uh, whaa..."
2900,Leela,Crud nuggets! We de-spaced right next to the Nimbus.
2901,Zoidberg,"Just when you think the chase is over, it gets twice as exciting!"
2902,Bender,"Hey, look at that."
2903,Zapp,"Well, well, well. My bloodhound-like instincts must have hunted them down while my other parts were throbbing to Duran Duran."
2904,Kif,Shall I initiate a pointless and potentially fatal pursuit?
2905,Zapp,Make it so.
2906,Bender,"It's gonna be fun on the bun, in space."
2907,Leela,Look! The asteroid. Now it's crawling with life. Like Zoidberg's sandals!
2908,Fry,Wow! It's incredible.
2909,Leela,But it'll be destroyed when Leo Wong blows up the violet dwarf. So why are you helping him?
2910,Fry,"I can't tell you, Leela. You just have to trust me."
2911,Leela,"You keep saying that, but you have to give me something to go on or I..."
2912,Planet Express Ship Alarm,Out of whale oil. Out of whale oil.
2913,Leela,The out-of-fuel indicator. It's indicating.
2914,Zoidberg,"Say, what's that violet-colored dwarf-like star thing we're drifting into?"
2915,Leela,The violet dwarf star!
2916,Fry,"Of course. The gorilla was the 18th hole, so we're headed into the ball return."
2917,Zoidberg,"Aye, what else now can go wrong?"
2918,Zapp on the monitor),"Ladies, you're under arrest. Prepare to be boarded again and again."
2919,Petunia,He'll never take me alive.
2920,Leela,Don't give up yet. I've got one more trick up my sleeve.
2921,Amy,That's exactly the number we need.
2922,Zapp,"Ah, the fairer sex."
2923,Zapp,"Something's very wrong here, and yet a little bit right."
2924,Leela,"Not so fast, Brannigan."
2925,Bender,"Even less fast, feministas!"
2926,Leela,Bender?
2927,Bender,All two tons of me.
2928,Bailiff,"Oye, oye, oye. All rise for the honorable Chief Justice D-O-G-G and the Associate Justices."
2929,Judge Dogg,"Yo. Seat it or beat it. The charges against y'all femditos is murder, mayhem, vandalism, kidnapping and resisting arrest. Damn! The big five. You may now make your opening ""what you got to say for yourselves."""
2930,Leela,"May it please the Court...  I mean, may it plizzle the cozizzle."
2931,Judge Dogg,Proceed.
2932,Leela,"These charges are outrageous. Our only goal was to save a rare violet star and its precious ecosystem. If protecting the environment is a crime, then..."
2933,Judge Dogg,Protecting the environment is a crime.
2934,Leela',I rest my mouth.
2935,Bailiff,Do you swear to tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth?
2936,Nixon,"I... Well, now, I... Am I under oath when I take the oath?"
2937,Ruth Bader Ginsburg's head,Can the witness identify the feminista leader?
2938,Bender,"That's her right there, with the ""I'm gonna kill you Bender"" look in her eye."
2939,Antonin Scalia's Head,"Hey, aren't you the robot who robbed me at gunpoint last year?"
2940,Bender,"No further answers, Your Honor."
2941,Fry,"Please, Justice Dogg, Leela and her friends are completely innocent."
2942,Judge Dogg,Hold up. Were you or were you not abducted by these hoes?
2943,Fry,"Well, abducted is such an ugly word."
2944,Clarence Thomas' head,"Mr. Wong, the court cannot compel you to testify against your own daughter."
2945,Mr. Wong,"No. No, I want to. Also, I got something to say about my wife."
2946,Judge Dogg,"Aw, yeah. Having heard some of the testimony over these jams I've been listening to, me and my crew will now kick it in the mix."
2947,Judge Dogg,"A'ight. We got us a verdict up in this High Court. Bailiff, drop it like it's legal precedent."
2948,Bailiff,"In the matter of Leo Wong v. The Greenorita Eco-Feminist Collective, four justices vote to convict, five to acquit."
2949,Antonin Scalia's Head,"However, since the vote was strictly along gender lines and the female justices' votes only count half, you are hereby found guilty."
2950,Ruth Ginsberg's Head,"It's a humiliating and biased system, but it works."
2951,Judge Dogg,Fifty years in the maximum security Dogg house.  Peace.
2952,Warden,Ladies! Welcome to Hell.
2953,Petunia,Beats Nutley on a Saturday night.
2954,Warden,"This is a privately-owned for-profit prison and I run a tight, cheap ship! I've done this by cutting costs everywhere, especially on punishment. I rely on you inmates to make prison unpleasant for yourselves. You're encouraged to sexually harass new prisoners, organize no-holds-barred catfights and maintain poor hygiene."
2955,Amy,"Try and make me, copper."
2956,Warden,Oh... a troublemaker.  Taste the lash of my 99-cent-store nightstick!
2957,Mr. Wong,"Yee-ha! With the feministas in jail, it full speed ahead. You and me, Fry. We implode the violet dwarf star tomorrow. Ka-boom-boom!"
2958,Fry,You and me?
2959,Mr. Wong,Yeah.
2960,Fry,Tomorrow?
2961,Mr. Wong,Tomorrow.
2962,Fry,Ka-boom?
2963,Mr. Wong,Ka-boom-boom!
2964,Fry,"Hello? Madfellows? I need to-  Okay, Leo Wong's about to destroy the violet dwarf. So, whatever I need to know to stop him, tell me now."
2965,Nine,"Alas! Stopping Wong isn't the only problem. One of the Dark Ones will try to stop you from stopping him. So, you must stop it from stopping you from stopping him."
2966,Fry,But how can I stop it stop me stop him?
2967,Nine,"Stop it! Behold, the Omega Device."
2968,Fry,"That's it? The name ""Omega Device"" sort of conjured up something cooler looking. Not that I'm disappointed or anything."
2969,Nine,The important thing is what's inside.
2970,Fry,What does that look like?
2971,Hutch,"No one knows, man. It was invented by a blind inventor, and the one dude he described it to was deaf."
2972,Mad Fellow,So the legend goes.
2973,Nine,"When activated, the device will emit a localized blast of delta-band noise to momentarily disable the Dark One."
2974,Fry,Like farting in a tent?
2975,Nine,"No, an elevator. Which is why you must strike the enemy at point blank range!"
2976,Fry,"But the Dark One could look like anything or anyone, right?"
2977,Hutch,Or anywhere.
2978,Fry,"So, what's your plan to recognize it?"
2979,Nine,We don't have one.
2980,Fry,Got it.
2981,Hutch,"And we don't dare think of one neither. 'Cause if we do, the Dark Ones might sense kind of the general vibe. Even through our mighty foil.  Oh, man! Anyone got some tape or some gum?"
2982,Nine,"As my colleague indicated, the plan cannot come from us, Fry. We were counting on you and your unreadable brain to come up with something."
2983,Fry,That was a mistake.
2984,Nine,I see that now.
2985,Hutch,"Freaky thing is, the Dark Ones' thoughts are unreadable, just like yours."
2986,Nine,"Yes, if we dared unwrap our heads, we could easily locate the one other being whose mind we can't read. The Dark One!"
2987,Hutch,But then the Dark One would read our minds and crush them like blood pumpkins.
2988,Fry,Wait. I can read minds and my mind can't be read. I have a plan.
2989,Nine,"Great. Whatever it is, don't tell us."
2990,Hutch,Wait. Fry can read minds and his mind can't be read. So he can safely scan for the Dark One...
2991,Nine,Shut up! Shut up!
2992,Hutch,...whose mind can't be read...
2993,"Mysterious, Sinister Voice","Leela, time is running out. We must get to the violet star."
2994,Leela,"Okay, okay. Shut up, already."
2995,Dixie,"Nobody's talking, Leela."
2996,Trixie,We're just painting each other's toenails with rat blood.
2997,Warden,"Lights out, ladies! Those compact fluorescent bulbs waste pennies a day."
2998,Leela,"Okay, feministas, all clear."
2999,Amy,Whoa!
3000,Linda,We now go live to Leela with the escape plan. Leela?
3001,Leela,"Thanks, Linda. Now we're in here because we tried to save endangered wildlife. So this time, endangered wildlife will save us."
3002,Amy,The Martian muck leech.
3003,Leela,That's right. He's been living off me since we got captured.  Little cutie almost sucked me dry.
3004,LaBarbara,Look at him go. Like a green snake through a sugarcane cake.
3005,Hermes,Keep trying.
3006,Morbo,"Our top story. The universe's most wanted eco-feminists are now behind bars, including gang leader, Turanga Leela. AKA, the Notorious B-I-Itch."
3007,Zoidberg,"We finished un-pinking the ship, Hubert. Now what?"
3008,Farnsworth,"Now we get back to work. And if that means destroying an ecosystem or two, so be it."
3009,Zoidberg,"I just meant without our good friends Fry, Leela, Amy and the robut."
3010,Farnsworth,"Oh, boo-hoo. This is a business, not a social club. Money talks."
3011,Lincoln,True wealth is measured in friendships.
3012,Farnsworth,"Shut up, you."
3013,Scruffy,Life goes on. But I believe we'll forever carry the pain on the inside.
3014,Amy,"Oh, no, a rooster! That indicates it's the following morning."
3015,LaBarbara,How's that creepy crawler doing?
3016,Leela,"I'm sorry, femi-sisters, but it pooped out around 3"
3017,Amy,"Well, I guess we failed. But what matters is, we tried our best and we looked good doing it."
3018,Amy,"Bender, is that you?"
3019,Bender,Who does it look like? My identical cousin Buster?
3020,Amy,Yes.
3021,Leela,You're here to break us out? But you're the one who put us in.
3022,Bender,"But I'm Bender, king of the combination shot. I put you in so that by busting you out, I could commit 15 felonies at once. Puttin' my rap sheet miles ahead of yours on the all-time chart."
3023,Leela,You are one devious bastard.
3024,Bender,That's what it says on my vanity plate.
3025,Leela,What about the sentries?
3026,Bender,"Already taken care of. I sent them a cake laced with nutmeg. That's a human sleeping drug, right?"
3027,Amy,"No, it's a human baking drug."
3028,Leela,"Okay, Plan B. Everyone knows men have one fatal weakness - they can't resist hookers. Dixie, Trixie, you know what to do."
3029,Bender,
3030,Mr. Wong,"Ladies and gentleman and whatever, welcome to my most environmentally disastrous implosion ever"
3031,Zapp,"Kif, old boy, mind if I sit on your shoulders for a better view?"
3032,Kif,"Well, actually, sir, I was hoping..."
3033,Zap,Thanks.
3034,Mr. Wong,"My associate Philip Fry here will have honor to blow this ugly, dirty star into nice, clean black hole."
3035,Mr. Wong,"Fry, careful those wires. What you doing down there?"
3036,Fry,"Just polishing your shoes, Mr. W."
3037,Mr. Wong,"Mmm, that nice. Get between the toes there, very dirty."
3038,Bender,"Well, so much for Plan B."
3039,Leela,What's Plan C?
3040,Bender,"All situations have the same Plan C. Bending, come on."
3041,Leela,"We're boned, Bender. It's a brick wall."
3042,Bender,"Granted, it's not on the list of approved bendables, but I'm so great!"
3043,Amy,Dogs! The boning continues!
3044,Bender,"Green Bluebird, this is Mr. Fabulous. We are go for cheesing it."
3045,Leela,Uh...
3046,Scruffy,Scruffy. The janitor.
3047,Leela,You helped us escape? Even after we locked you in a go-go cage like common go-go dancers?
3048,Farnsworth,"I couldn't live with myself, Leela. I call myself a scientist, wear the white coat and probe a monkey every now and again, yet I put monetary gain ahead of preserving nature. Can you ever forgive me?"
3049,Scruffy,I reckon.
3050,Leela,"I could kiss you, Professor."
3051,Farnsworth,"Okay, but watch out for my new grill."
3052,Zapp Brannigan,"Before the grand finally , as it were, it seems only fitting that I, Commodore 64 Zapp Brannigan, say a few brief pages in honor of..."
3053,Nine,"Whatever your plan is, Fry, I suggest you get on with it. Get... Shoot, I got hot sauce on my Number 9 shirt."
3054,Fry,"Okay, locate the Dark One by finding someone whose thoughts I can't read."
3055,Zapp Brannigan,And unaccustomed...
3056,Zapp Brannigan,By God! I'm the greatest speaker of all time. They're suckling at the teats of my every syllable.
3057,Zapp Brannigan,Allow me now...
3058,Kif,His voice is like ear sandpaper.I miss Amy.
3059,Nixon's Head,The one secret no one ever suspected is that I really did stage the moon landing. On Venus.
3060,Mom,
3061,Calculon,"I'd like to thank the academy, my agent, and most of all, my operating system, Windows Vista, for everything it... System error."
3062,Snoop Dogg,Naked ladies. Naked ladies. Naked ladies. Naked ladies.
3063,Mr. Wong,I never should have taken that accent elimination class from Jackie Chan.
3064,Zapp Brannigan,"And so, as we obliterize this star, let us remember those immortal words once spoken by a great man, moi. And I quote, ""All good things must come to an end, preferably in a humongous explosion."""
3065,Mr. Wong,Let's pop this beach ball.
3066,ALL,Ten! Nine! Eight!
3067,Fry,"There's no one here whose thoughts can't be read. No one, except me! My thoughts can't be read. But, but that's crazy. If I were the Dark One, I'd know it, wouldn't I? But, here I am, right where the Dark One would be, about to blow up the star. Oh, God! Somewhere deep inside of me, it's me! I'm the Dark One!"
3068,ALL,Two... one!
3069,Leela,Put your hands in the air!
3070,Snoop Dogg,Should we wave them like we just don't care?
3071,Leela,That's optional.
3072,Mr. Wong,You girl punks gone too far this time. Your parents should be ashamed.
3073,Amy,"Yes, you should!"
3074,Mrs. Wong,Amy?
3075,Kif,Amy!
3076,"Mysterious, Sinister Voice","Destroy the star, Leo, hurry."
3077,Mr. Wong,"You got it, Mr. Voice-in-my-head.  I've gotta admit, Amy, you got a pretty good swing."
3078,Amy,"Really? Thanks, Dad."
3079,Leela,"Okay, time to defuse this star cracker once and for all."
3080,Fry,"Leela, wait. You're making a mistake. You have no idea what's really going on."
3081,Leela,What is really going on?
3082,Fry,I can't tell you.
3083,Leela,Then why should I trust you? Why?
3084,Fry,Because... Because...
3085,Leela,You're you. That's all I need to know.
3086,Bender,No! Don't do it!
3087,Scruffy,Fiddlesticks.
3088,Amy,"Leela, are you crazy? We became fugitives and jail-breakers to stop him."
3089,Bender,"And hookers, don't forget hookers."
3090,Leela,"Shame on all of you. After everything we've been through together, do you really think Fry would-"
3091,Fry,"Goodbye, Leela. I destroy myself to save you."
3092,Nixon's Head,Where's the boom? I was expecting a boom.
3093,Fry,"It didn't work. I'm the Dark One, and it didn't do anything."
3094,"Mysterious, Sinister Voice","You're not the Dark One, I am!"
3095,Fry,Leela?!
3096,Mysterious Voice,"Not Leela, you moron. Me!  What did you do to me?"
3097,Leela,Ew!
3098,Dark One,"I am the Dark One. The very last Dark One. How is it possible I couldn't read your mind? Oh, I am momentarily disabled."
3099,Randy,What's happening out there?
3100,Sal,Somethings wondersful.
3101,Leela,The star and the asteroid. They were an egg and a sperm.
3102,Preacherbot,Great modem of mercy. Cover the children's eyes.
3103,Morbo,There are no children here.
3104,Preacherbot,Then move your fat head. I can't see.
3105,Nine,The Encyclopod is reborn. A new green age has begun!
3106,Mad Fellow,So the legend foretold.
3107,Farnsworth,Look! Inside its pouch. Extinct Tasmanian tigers!
3108,Amy,And dodo birds!
3109,Leela,And white rhinos!
3110,Hermes,And striped biologist-taunters!
3111,Striped biologist-taunter,"What are you gonna do, shoot us?"
3112,Encyclopod,"Life!  These once extinct plants and animals are my gift to the universe. Through untold generations, my race has treasured their DNA. Treat them wisely with the knowledge that all species are precious."
3113,Leela,This is unbelievable. What's going on?
3114,Hutch,"To answer that, I must tell you a story. A story of two alien species so ancient that-"
3115,Fry,"Hutch, are you okay?"
3116,Hutch,My sister's femi-necklace.
3117,Fry,"What?   Hey, how come I can't read your thoughts anymore?"
3118,Encyclopod,"I shall avenge you, Hutch...Waterfall."
3119,Nine,"After all these eons, the Dark Ones are no more. Will you preserve their DNA, O Great Encyclopod?"
3120,Encyclopod,"I suppose I should. Wait, where did it go?"
3121,Zoidberg,What?
3122,Encyclopod,"Well, at any rate, I shall preserve the DNA of Homo sapiens."
3123,Fry,Huh. I thought you only saved the DNA of endangered species.
3124,Fry,I guess he didn't hear me.
3125,Bender,"Well, looks like that wraps everything up in a nice big, old, fat sack of..."
3126,Zapp Brannigan,"I hereby arrest you fugitives on 53 counts of... fugivity. Kif, round them up, and spare me the weary sigh for once.  Kif?"
3127,Kif,Wait for me.
3128,Fry,"Well, this is the end. There was so many things I wanted to say to you."
3129,Leela,Like what?
3130,Fry,"Like this is not the end. But mostly just, I love you, Leela."
3131,Leela,"Maybe I waited too long to say this, but I love you, too- WORMHOLE!"
3132,Hermes,"Sweet topology of cosmology, it's huge!"
3133,Farnsworth,"If we fly into it, it could take us trillions of light years away. There's no knowing if we'll ever return."
3134,Fry,What do we do? Should we go for it?
3135,Bender,"Into the breach, meatbags. Or not. Whatever."
3136,ALL,"Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go."
