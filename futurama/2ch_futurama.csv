1568,That is completely reckless Dont you ever think ahead,Leela
1569,Hell no If I stopped to think ahead I wouldnt be Emperor And I wouldnt even be here in the year 3000 Its just like the story of the grasshopper and the octopus All year long the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter while the octopus mooched off his girlfriend and watched TV But then the winter came and the grasshopper died and the octopus ate all his acorns and also he got a racecar Is any of this getting through to you,Fry
1570,I give up Youre gonna get yourself killed and this time I wont be here to save you,Leela

13775,But we have to The world needs Star Trek to give people hope for the future,Fry
13776,But its set 800 years in the past,Leela
13778,Cause itit taught me so much Like how you should accept people whether they be black white Klingon or even female But most importantly when I didnt have any friends it made me feel like maybe I did,Fry

13858,I didnt wanna leave them either Fry but what are we supposed to do,Leela
13859,Well usually on the show someone would come up with a complicated plan then explain it with a simple analogy,Fry
13860,Hmm If we can reroute engine power through the primary weapons and reconfigure them to Melllvars frequency that should overload his electroquantum structure,Leela
13862,Of course Its so simple,Fry
13873,Its not working Hes drawing straight from our weapons,Leela
13874,Like a balloon and  something bad happens,Fry

15311,"That isnt what I meant
That isnt what I signed",Leela
15317,"Destiny has cheated me
By forcing me to decide upon

And she marries him
Then he probably wont want me dating her",Fry
