41,FRY,"My God, a million years!",FRY
42,LEELA,I'm sure this must be very upsetting for you.,LEELA
43,FRY,"Y'know, I guess it should be but actually I'm glad. I had nothing to live for in my old life. I was broke, I had a humiliating job and I was beginning to suspect my girlfriend might be cheating on me.",FRY
44,LEELA,"Well, at least here you'll be treated with dignity. Now strip naked and get on the probulator.",LEELA
45,LEELA,Interesting. Your DNA test shows one living relative. He's your great great great great great great great...,LEELA

48,LEELA,Professor Hubert Farnsworth.,LEELA

55,LEELA,Then you'll be fired...,LEELA
57,LEELA,...out of a cannon into the Sun!,LEELA
58,FRY,But I don't like being a delivery boy.,FRY
59,LEELA,"Well that's tough! Lots of people don't like their jobs but we do them anyway. You gotta do what you gotta do! Now hold out your hand, I'm gonna implant your career chip. It'll permanently label you as a delivery boy.",LEELA
60,FRY,Keep that thing away from me!,FRY
61,LEELA,"Hold still, damnit. I don't have good depth perception!  You've got until the count of five to let me out of here. One...",LEELA
62,FRY,See you in a thousand years!  You owe me one.,FRY
65,FRY,Cool!  Um. Cross Town Express?,FRY
67,FRY,"Hey! A phone booth! I can call my nephew. Wow, a real live robot! Or is that some kind of cheesy New Year's costume?",FRY
69,FRY,It doesn't look so shiny to me.,FRY
73,FRY,"Yeah, I'd like to place a collect call.",FRY
77,FRY,Help! What's happening?,FRY
79,BENDER,Lousy stinking rip-off!  Well I didn't have anything else planned for today. Let's go get drunk!,BENDER
84,LEELA,"Look, he's just a nobody who doesn't want to be a delivery boy. I'd really rather not force it on him.",LEELA
86,FRY,Why would a robot need to drink?,FRY
87,BENDER,"I don't need to drink, I can quit anytime I want!  So they made you a delivery boy, huh? Man, that's as bad as my job.",BENDER
88,FRY,Really? What do you do Bender?,FRY
89,BENDER,"I'm a bender. I bend girders, that's all I'm programmed to do.",BENDER
91,BENDER,"You kidding? I was a star! I could bend a girder to any angle: 30 degrees, 32 degrees, you name it! (unsure) 31. (normal) But I couldn't go on living once I found out what the girders were for.",BENDER
93,BENDER,"Suicide booths!  Well, Fry, it was a pleasure meeting you, I'm gonna go kill myself.",BENDER
94,FRY,Wait! You're the only friend I have!,FRY
95,BENDER,You really want a robot for a friend?,BENDER
96,FRY,"Yeah, ever since I was six.",FRY
97,BENDER,"Well, OK. But I don't want people thinking we're robo-sexuals, so if anyone asks, you're my debugger.",BENDER
98,FRY,"Oh, no, it's the Cyclops!  Don't look! Don't look!",FRY
100,LEELA,This is officer 1B-DI requesting back-up.,LEELA
102,BENDER,"We can hide in here, it's free on Tuesdays.",BENDER
104,FRY,Spock? Hey! Do the thing!,FRY
106,FRY,This is unbelievable! What do you heads do all day?,FRY
111,LEELA,"I'm sorry, Fry, but I have to install your career chip.",LEELA
112,FRY,"Yeah, well, if you're sorry why are you doing it?",FRY
113,LEELA,It's my job. You gotta do what you gotta do!,LEELA
116,FRY,Ow! Stoppit! Down boy! Bad president!,FRY
119,LEELA,"Please, officers, there's no need to use force.",LEELA
121,LEELA,"Oh, come on, he's just a poor kid from the Stupid Ages.",LEELA
123,LEELA,No-one makes fun of my nose.,LEELA
125,LEELA,You guys were totally out of control.,LEELA
129,FRY,"Wait a second. You're a bender, right? We can get out of here if you just bend the bars.",FRY
130,BENDER,"Dream on, skin tube. I'm only programmed to bend for constructive purposes. What do I look like, a de-bender?",BENDER
131,FRY,Who cares what you're programmed for. If someone programmed you to jump off a bridge would you do it?,FRY
132,BENDER,I'll have to check my program...yep.,BENDER
134,FRY,"C'mon, Bender! It's up to you to make your own decisions in life. That's what separates people and robots from animals...and animal robots.",FRY
135,BENDER,"You're full of crap, Fry!  You make a persuasive argument, Fry.",BENDER
136,FRY,"Come on, Bender! You can do it.",FRY
137,BENDER,Can't...I...can't...do...it!,BENDER
139,BENDER,"You were right, Fry! From now on I'm going to bend what I want, when I want, who I want! I'm unstoppable!",BENDER
140,FRY,I don't know how you did that.,FRY
143,BENDER,Looks like one of us will have to bend this grate.,BENDER
144,FRY,Good Lord! What is this?,FRY
145,BENDER,"It's the decaying ruins of Old New York. Welcome home, pal!",BENDER
146,FRY,"Its my old neighbourhood. Man, this brings back a lot of memories.",FRY
147,BENDER,"Keep 'em to yourself, pops.",BENDER
148,FRY,This is where I brought my girlfriend on our very first date.,FRY
149,FRY,My God! She's gone. Everyone I ever knew or cared about is gone.,FRY
150,BENDER,Wait! There's someone you know!,BENDER
151,FRY,"Oh, can't you leave me alone? I'm miserable enough already.",FRY
152,LEELA,"Look, I know it's not much consolation but I understand how you feel.",LEELA
153,FRY,"No, you don't. I've got no home, no family...",FRY
155,FRY,...My whole world is gone. You can't possibly understand what it feels like to be so alone.,FRY
156,LEELA,I understand. I'm the only one-eyed alien on this whole planet. My parents abandoned me here as a baby and I don't even know what galaxy they were from. I know how it feels to be alone.,LEELA
157,FRY,"Look, Leela, I don't understand this world but you obviously do, so I give up. If you really think I should be a delivery boy, I'll do it.  Your chip. What are you doing?",FRY
160,LEELA,Because I've always wanted to. I just never realised it before I met you.,LEELA
161,FRY,What is the matter with you?,FRY
162,BENDER,I just wanted to be part of the moment.,BENDER
164,BENDER,"Sorry.  Well, that solves the mystery of the missing ring. This calls for a drink.",BENDER
165,LEELA,I don't wanna spoil the party but we're all job deserters now. We're unemployed and we have nowhere to go.,LEELA
166,FRY,Correction. We're unemployed but we have a doddering old relative to mooch off of.,FRY
169,FRY,I'm your dear old Uncle Fry.,FRY
170,FARNSWORTH,I don't have an Uncle Fry.,FARNSWORTH
172,FARNSWORTH,"By God, I am your nephew! This is absolutely incredible!",FARNSWORTH
173,BENDER,Can we have some money?,BENDER
175,FARNSWORTH,Let me show you around. That's my lab table and this is my work-stool. And over there is my intergalactic spaceship! And here's where I keep assorted lengths of wire.,FARNSWORTH
176,FRY,Whoa! A real live spaceship!,FRY
177,FARNSWORTH,I designed it myself. Let me show you some of the different lengths of wire I used.,FARNSWORTH
182,LEELA,Can't we get away in the ship?,LEELA
183,FARNSWORTH,I suppose it is technically possible. Though I am already in my pyjamas.,FARNSWORTH
184,FRY,I'll get us out of here.,FRY
185,FARNSWORTH,Can anyone drive stick?,FARNSWORTH
186,LEELA,I can. As long as I don't have to parallel park.,LEELA
188,LEELA,Prepare for lift-off. Ten.,LEELA
201,FRY,"So I guess without jobs, we'll be fugitives forever.",FRY
202,FARNSWORTH,"Not necessarily. Are you three, by any chance, interested in becoming my new spaceship crew?",FARNSWORTH
203,BENDER,New crew? W-What happened to the old crew?,BENDER
204,FARNSWORTH,Of those poor sons of -- but that's not important. The important thing is I need a new crew. Anyone interested?,FARNSWORTH
205,FRY,Yes! Yes! That's exactly the job I've always wanted!,FRY
206,LEELA,"Thanks for the offer, Professor, but we don't have the proper career chips.",LEELA
207,FARNSWORTH,"Oh, that won't be a problem. As luck would have it I saved the chips from my previous crew.",FARNSWORTH
208,FRY,This is awesome! Are we gonna fly through space fighting monsters and teaching alien women to lurve?,FRY
209,FARNSWORTH,"If by that you mean ""transporting cargo"" then yes. It's a little home business I started to fund my research.",FARNSWORTH
210,FRY,Cool! What's my job gonna be?,FRY
211,FARNSWORTH,You will be responsible for ensuring that the cargo reaches its destination.,FARNSWORTH
212,FRY,"So, I'm gonna be a delivery boy?",FRY
214,FRY,Alright! I'm a delivery boy!,FRY
217,FARNSWORTH,As new employees I'd like your opinion on our commercial. I paid to have it air during the Superbowl.,FARNSWORTH
219,FARNSWORTH,"Not on the same channel, of course.",FARNSWORTH
226,FRY,Are there really giant birds like that?,FRY
227,FARNSWORTH,"No, no! That was all just special effects! Now let's have breakfast. I hope everyone likes eggs.",FARNSWORTH
228,FRY,I'm never going to get used to the 31st century.  Caffinated bacon? Baconated grapefruit? Admiral Crunch?,FRY
229,LEELA,"Well, if you don't like that try some Archduke Chocula.",LEELA
230,FARNSWORTH,"Ah, Hermes! Crew, meet Hermes Conrad. He manages my delivery business, pays the bills, notifies next of kin, what have you.",FARNSWORTH
232,FARNSWORTH,"Oh, my! I haven't picked a new captain yet. It's always so hard to choose.",FARNSWORTH
235,LEELA,(reading) Death by airlock failure.,LEELA
237,LEELA,(reading) Death by brain parasite.,LEELA
239,LEELA,(reading) Death by sonic diarrhoea?,LEELA
241,LEELA,"Look, I don't know about any of your previous captains but I intend to do as little dying as possible.",LEELA
243,FARNSWORTH,"Now Fry, before you go into space you'll need to see our staff doctor. I should warn you though, he's a little unusual. (whispering) He wears sandals!",FARNSWORTH
245,FARNSWORTH,"Dr. Zoidberg, this is Fry, the new delivery boy. He needs a physical.",FARNSWORTH
251,FRY,"Uh, is there a human doctor around?",FRY
253,FARNSWORTH,"Dear Lord, Bender, you're filthy.",FARNSWORTH
254,BENDER,"Yeah, like you don't have crap in your neck!",BENDER
255,FARNSWORTH,"Amy, why don't you give his body a going over with the cleaning pick?",FARNSWORTH
259,FRY,"Well, the doctor says I'm as healthy as a crab. Can I go into space now?",FRY
260,FARNSWORTH,"As soon as we finish cleaning Bender. Oh, and Fry, this is our intern, Amy Wong. She's an engineering student of mine. (whispering) I like having her around because she's the same blood type as me.",FARNSWORTH
262,FRY,(chuffed) Last time I checked.,FRY
263,LEELA,Hang on. Amy Wong? Of the Mars Wongs?,LEELA
265,LEELA,Uh-huh! What sorority do you belong to?,LEELA
267,BENDER,"Hey, rich girl. Look over here! It's me, Bender. I'm being entertaining. (singing) La la la look at my head. It's all painted look at my head! I got a big old head, hey! Ho! (talking) Alright, show's over, I'm tired.",BENDER
268,FARNSWORTH,"Ah, to be young again. And also a robot! Now as I recall you youngsters have a package to deliver.",FARNSWORTH
269,FRY,"Finally! Come on Bender, let's mosey!",FRY
271,FRY,So where are we going anyway?,FRY
272,LEELA,Nowhere special. The moon.,LEELA
273,FRY,The moon? The moon moon? Wow! I'm gonna be a famous hero just like Neil Armstrong and those other brave guys no one ever heard of!,FRY
275,LEELA,Well...I guess so. Just be careful. I'd like to hold off any major screwups until at least my second day as captain.,LEELA
277,FRY,Can I do the countdown?,FRY
278,LEELA,"Huh? Oh sure, knock yourself out.",LEELA
281,FRY,"Hurry up, I wanna see the moon!",FRY
282,LEELA,"Relax, its open till 9.",LEELA
283,FRY,That's one small step for Fry --,FRY
285,FRY,"Wow!  Um, can I have cuts?",FRY
287,FRY,You're not gonna believe this but they landed an amusement park on the moon!,FRY
290,LEELA,"Fry, we have a crate to deliver.",LEELA
291,FRY,Let's just dump it in the sewer and say we delivered it.,FRY
292,BENDER,Too much work. Lets burn it and say we dumped it in the sewer.,BENDER
293,LEELA,"OK, if everyone's finished being stupid --",LEELA
294,FRY,I had more but you go ahead.,FRY
295,LEELA,We'll deliver that crate like professionals and then we'll go home.,LEELA
296,FRY,But I've never been to the moon before.,FRY
297,LEELA,"Alright. We'll deliver that crate like professionals...and then we'll go ride the bumper cars.  Amy, why don't you help Fry hoist down the crate. Then lock up when you're done. Just be careful.",LEELA
304,FRY,My first space delivery.,FRY
305,FRY,"Uh, greetings, Moon Man, we come in peace. I am Fry from the planet Earth.",FRY
307,FRY,"But you are lazy, right?",FRY
310,BENDER,Better mascots than you have tried.,BENDER
313,BENDER,Idiots who need gifts for other idiots.,BENDER
314,FRY,"Hey, I got you guys refrigerator magnets.",FRY
315,BENDER,"Get it off! Get it off! Get it -- uh oh!  (singing) How many roads must a man walk down, before you... (talking) Keep those things off of me! Magnets screw up my inhibition unit!",BENDER
316,FRY,So you flip out and start acting like some crazy folk singer?,FRY
317,BENDER,Yes. I guess a robot would have to be crazy to wanna be a folk singer.,BENDER
320,BENDER,"Oh, jeez, I went to high school with that guy!",BENDER
327,FRY,"I don't know. This place is great and all but its just so artificial. The gravity, the air, the gophers. You might as well stay on Earth.  That's what I came to see! I wanna go out there and jump around like an astronaut. Screw this phoney stuff!",FRY
328,LEELA,But the phoney stuff is what's fun. It's boring out there.,LEELA
329,BENDER,Yeah! You're the kind of guy who visits Jerusalem and doesn't want to see the Sexeteria!,BENDER
330,LEELA,Maybe I should take Fry on the Luna Rover ride. You get to wear a space suit and drive around on the surface. And the line's short because it's educational.,LEELA
331,FRY,I don't care how educational it is. Let's do it!,FRY
332,BENDER,(shouting) Next year in Jerusalem!,BENDER
333,FRY,Finally! Get ready for some serious moon action.,FRY
336,LEELA,"Wow, I never realised the first astronauts were so fat!",LEELA
337,FRY,"That's not an astronaut, it's a TV comedian. And he was just using space travel as a metaphor for beating his wife.",FRY
339,BENDER,"Look, it's that crate we were gonna throw in the sewer.",BENDER
341,BENDER,Nah. She'll probably make me do it.,BENDER
349,LEELA,(singing) ...and sing a whaling tune. We're whalers on the moon...,LEELA
350,FRY,That's not how it happened.,FRY
351,LEELA,"Oh, really? I don't see you with a fungineering degree! p>",LEELA
352,FRY,This is stupid. I'm taking this thing out to the real moon.,FRY
353,LEELA,"Fry, no. This is my first mission and I'm not gonna let us get in any trouble. Besides, the car's on a track.",LEELA
356,LEELA,"OK, you're on the surface. Now I'll give you 10 minutes. Then you'll get bored, turn around and apologise for being such a jerk. Agreed?",LEELA
357,FRY,Agreed.  Yee-haw! Woo! Yeah! Crank up the radio!,FRY
360,LEELA,Time's up. Make a U-turn at the next crater.,LEELA
361,FRY,No not yet. How 'bout we go look for the original moon landing site?,FRY
362,LEELA,That's crazy! It's been lost for centuries!,LEELA
363,FRY,Well I'm feelin' lucky!  Uh... I'm ready to go back now.,FRY
364,FRY,"We're gonna die! It's every man for himself!  Help me, Leela!  You did it! We're safe!",FRY
365,LEELA,No. Now we're gonna die.,LEELA
366,FRY,It's every man for himself.,FRY
367,BENDER,"Hey, look what I won from a tourist's pocket!",BENDER
369,BENDER,"Come on, it's just like making love. Y'know: Left, down, rotate 62 degrees, engage rotor.",BENDER
371,BENDER,"Here, let me do it.  Ah, lousy arm. Must be rigged!  That's her, officers! Uh, that's the woman who programmed me for evil!",BENDER
372,BENDER,"Yeah, well, I'm gonna go build my own theme park, with blackjack and hookers. In fact, forget the park!",BENDER
373,FRY,"(gasping) I'm sorry, Leela, I can't go on any further. Just leave me to die in that barn over there.",FRY
376,FRY,"No, sir. We're amusement park patrons.",FRY
378,LEELA,Our car broke down and we're out of oxygen. Can we borrow some?,LEELA
380,FRY,I guess we could do chores for a few hours.,FRY
381,LEELA,"Fry, night lasts two weeks on the moon.",LEELA
393,LEELA,"I told you to turn around and go back to the park. But oh, no, the park was too phoney. We had to see the real moon.",LEELA
394,FRY,"And it was great! We got to see craters and rocks and that one incredible rock that looked like a crater and, and these fellas.",FRY
395,LEELA,"Fry, face it. The moon is a dump. It's a boring dried up wasteland. And the only reason anybody ever comes here is for the tacky little amusement park. Can't you just accept that?",LEELA
398,BENDER,He'll never find me in here.,BENDER
400,FRY,"Oh, Bender. You didn't touch the Crushinator, did you?",FRY
401,BENDER,Of course not. A lady that fine you gotta romance first.,BENDER
405,LEELA,Hang on. Hang on. Jump.  Hold on to your helmet!,LEELA
408,FRY,"Hey, cool! Dark side of the moon!",FRY
409,LEELA,"Nightfall's coming.  Hurry, before we freeze.",LEELA
410,BENDER,"What do you mean ""we"", mammal?",BENDER
411,FARNSWORTH,"Oh, dear! I really ought to do something. But I am already in my pyjamas.",FARNSWORTH
412,LEELA,We can't outrun it forever.,LEELA
413,FRY,Over there! Look! It's the moon landing site! We found it!,FRY
415,FRY,"It's that flag from MTV! And Neil Armstrong's footprint!  Hey! My foot's bigger! Leela, isn't this the greatest thing you've ever seen?",FRY
416,LEELA,"Fry, look around. It's just a crummy plastic flag and a dead man's tracks in the dust.  Now get in here before you freeze.",LEELA
417,BENDER,"Oh, no room for Bender, huh? Fine! I'll go build my own lunar lander, with blackjack and hookers. In fact, forget the lunar lander and the blackjack. Ah, screw the whole thing.",BENDER
418,LEELA,Well if the oxygen holds out we might live long enough to starve to death.,LEELA
419,FRY,"Look, Leela, I'm sorry. I never should have dragged you out here.",FRY
420,LEELA,"That's right, you shouldn't have. I still don't get what the big attraction is.",LEELA
421,FRY,I never told anybody this but a thousand years ago I used to look up at the moon and dream about being an astronaut. I just didn't have the grades. Nor the physical endurance. Plus I threw up a lot and nobody liked spending a week with me.,FRY
422,LEELA,A week would be a little much.,LEELA
423,FRY,"The moon was like this awesome, romantic, mysterious thing, hanging up there in the sky where you could never reach it, no matter how much you wanted to. But you're right. Once you're actually here it's just a big dull rock. I guess I just wanted you to see it through my eyes, the way I used to.",FRY
424,LEELA,"Fry, look. It really is beautiful. I don't know why I never noticed before.",LEELA
427,LEELA,Amy? Where'd she learn to operate the controls like that?,LEELA
428,BENDER,Not the magnet! No! No! Nooo --  Uh-oh!,BENDER
429,BENDER,"(singing) She'll be comin' round the mountain when she comes,",BENDER
431,BENDER,"(singing) She'll be riding six white horses when she comes,",BENDER
432,LEELA,"So, Fry, was the real moon anything like the moon you used to dream about?",LEELA
435,BENDER,"Well I'll shoot her with my ray gun when she comes,",BENDER
440,FRY,I'm sorry. I was up really late poking through people's desks.,FRY
443,LEELA,What the hell are you doing?! You're getting a huge dose of radiation!,LEELA
445,LEELA,Do you know how long it's going to take me to recalibrate these engines?,LEELA
446,FRY,"Hey, when you look this good, you don't have to know anything.",FRY
447,LEELA,"Professor, We need to talk to you about Fry.",LEELA
448,BENDER,"That's right, we want some money -- wait, what's this about Fry?",BENDER
449,LEELA,He's a nice guy but we think it's about time he got his own place.,LEELA
450,FARNSWORTH,"Oh, fuff! He's not causing any trouble. Now, if you don't mind, I'm rather busy. I seem to have mislaid my alien mummy. This sarcophagus should contain the remains of Emperor Nimballa, who ruled Zubin 5 over 29 million years ago.",FARNSWORTH
451,FRY,"Hey, Professor, great jerky!",FRY
452,FARNSWORTH,"My God, this is an outrage! I was going to eat that mummy! Fry has got to go!",FARNSWORTH
456,FRY,"Sheesh! 40,000 channels and only 150 have anything good on.",FRY
461,FRY,"Hmm, must be a friend of theirs.",FRY
462,BENDER,"Fry, we've got to discuss your living arrangements.",BENDER
463,LEELA,We've all talked it over and --,LEELA
464,BENDER,"Hey, All My Circuits! Move over.  Ahh!",BENDER
465,LEELA,"Fry, sometimes in close quarters, people do inconsiderate things without realising it.",LEELA
466,FRY,I know but I forgive you.,FRY
467,LEELA,"No, Fry, by ""close quarters"" I mean this office...",LEELA
469,LEELA,"...and by ""people"" I mean you!",LEELA
471,LEELA,"And by ""inconsiderate"" I mean --",LEELA
472,FRY,Leela! We're trying to watch TV.,FRY
473,BENDER,"Yeah, would you kindly shut your noise hole?",BENDER
474,FRY,"So, who's that weird-looking guy?",FRY
477,BENDER,"Eh, the usual human stuff. He laughs, he learns, he loves.",BENDER
481,FRY,"Hey, uh, why is the TV getting smaller?",FRY
483,BENDER,"Cheer up, meatbag, you've barely touched your amoeba.",BENDER
484,FRY,It looked good but I just don't feel like eating. You want it?,FRY
485,BENDER,"Nah, I'm trying to watch my input. I need plenty of wholesome, nutritious alcohol.  The chemical energy keeps my fuel cells charged.",BENDER
486,FRY,What are the cigars for?,FRY
487,BENDER,They make me look cool.,BENDER
488,FRY,I can't believe they threw me out like that. I must have been really acting like a jerk.,FRY
489,BENDER,"Yeah, but everybody's a jerk. You, me, this jerk.  That's my philosophy. So, where you gonna stay?",BENDER
490,FRY,I don't know. Do refrigerators still come in cardboard boxes?,FRY
491,BENDER,"Yeah, but the rents are outrageous. Why don't you just come move in with me?",BENDER
492,FRY,Really? That'd be great! You sure I won't be imposing?,FRY
493,BENDER,"Nah, I've always wanted a pet.",BENDER
494,BENDER,Here we are. Your new home.,BENDER
495,FRY,"Cool! Y'know, I've never even seen a robot's apartment before.",FRY
496,BENDER,"Come on in, I'll give you the tour!",BENDER
497,BENDER,"Let's see, where to start. OK, this is the TV area, that over there's the breakfast nook, and over here is where you'll be living which is great because, until now, it's just been wasted space.",BENDER
498,FRY,It's kinda cramped in here. I don't even have room to hang my clothes.,FRY
499,BENDER,"Look, pal, you've only got one set of clothes and you're not taking them off while I'm here. Well, I'm bushed. G'night.",BENDER
501,BENDER,(sleep-talking) Kill all humans...kill all humans...must kill all the humans.,BENDER
503,BENDER,I was having the most wonderful dream. I think you were in it.,BENDER
504,FRY,"Uh, listen, Bender, uh, where's your bathroom?",FRY
511,BENDER,"(sleep-talking) Hey, sexy mama...wanna kill all the humans?",BENDER
512,LEELA,We sure are cheerful this morning.,LEELA
513,BENDER,"Yeah, this past week with Fry's been a blast! Y'know, beneath this warm, sunny exterior, beats the cold, mechanical heart of a robot.",BENDER
515,FRY,"Oh, it's Bender's apartment. He put in carpeting yesterday so now my head hits the ceiling. Hey, do you realise you're standing at a weird angle?  Now you're OK.",FRY
516,LEELA,Look at yourself. You're a wreck! You've got to find a new place to live.,LEELA
517,FRY,(sexily) Is that an invitation?,FRY
518,LEELA,"Love your optimism, Fry. But seriously, you've got to tell Bender you're moving out.",LEELA
519,FRY,"Yeah, but he might get kind of upset. I don't think I can do that to him.",FRY
520,BENDER,"Hey, there's my little space heater.",BENDER
523,FRY,"I'm sorry, Bender, but there's just not enough room.",FRY
524,BENDER,Not enough room? My place is two cubic metres and we only take up 1.5 cubic metres. We've got room for a whole nother two-thirds of a person.,BENDER
525,LEELA,What if I just helped the two of you find a bigger apartment?,LEELA
526,BENDER,I don't know. I've got a lot of great memories in my old place.  And now they're gone.,BENDER
528,LEELA,At least it's got a great view.,LEELA
531,LEELA,Wow! Now this is fantastic!,LEELA
532,FRY,"Hmm, I'm not sure we want to pay for a dimension we're not going to use.",FRY
533,FRY,"Well, I give up. What's the catch?",FRY
535,FRY,Not one place even remotely liveable.,FRY
536,FARNSWORTH,"Oh, how awful. Did he at least die painlessly...? To shreds, you say. Well, how is his wife holding up...? To shreds, you say. Very well then.  Sad, sad, terrible, gruesome news about my colleague, Dr. Mobootu.",FARNSWORTH
537,LEELA,Was his apartment rent-controlled?,LEELA
538,LEELA,"Wow, this is beautiful.",LEELA
539,BENDER,What's with all the crap?,BENDER
542,FRY,"Well, this place has everything except the only thing I care about: A TV.",FRY
546,BENDER,"Whoa, slow down! This place just doesn't feel like home. It just isn't...cosy. Ahh, I can barely move.   It's perfect!",BENDER
547,FRY,"Man, it's a total sty! For the first time in a thousand years, I feel like I'm home.",FRY
548,BENDER,"Yeah! It's gonna be fun on the bun! Y'know Fry, of all the friends I've had, you're the first.",BENDER
550,LEELA,"Happy housewarming, Fry!  It's a miniature fruit salad tree.",LEELA
553,FARNSWORTH,"This is for you, Fry  Zevulon the Great. He's teriyaki style.",FARNSWORTH
554,BENDER,"Wow, heavy drinking crowd!  I'd better go out for more beer.",BENDER
555,FRY,"Hey, hang on, All My Circuits is about to start!",FRY
556,BENDER,"I know, but I need alcohol to power up my batteries. If Calculon's wedding doesn't go just right I'll be emotionally and electrically drained.",BENDER
560,FRY,"Shh, the wedding's about to start!",FRY
562,FRY,Is he objecting or backing up?,FRY
568,BENDER,Hey what happened to the TV?,BENDER
570,BENDER,This is an outrage! I'm gonna go yell at the manager!,BENDER
572,FRY,"(shouting) Come back, Bender, its working!",FRY
575,BENDER,What? That's the last straw!,BENDER
578,BENDER,Yeah! And you'd better get rid of whatever's causing it or we're outta this dump!,BENDER
586,BENDER,You people are nuts. My antenna never interfered with my old TV.,BENDER
587,LEELA,You had cable. This is satellite.,LEELA
588,FARNSWORTH,Obviously your thoughts are being transmitted on the same frequency.,FARNSWORTH
590,BENDER,"Madam, I believe you're mistaken!",BENDER
591,BENDER,"Wow, that lady's got a huge ass!",BENDER
592,BENDER,"Those could be anyone's thoughts, fat ass!",BENDER
597,BENDER,"Fine! Come on, Fry, let's move to that apartment that smelled like a sewer. You liked that one, right?",BENDER
598,FRY,"It's tempting, but, well, I am already kinda settled in here.",FRY
599,BENDER,Or we could live underground with the mutants. A little fire'll show 'em who's boss!,BENDER
600,FRY,"Uh, listen, is there maybe some way we could do this with you going and me not going?",FRY
602,FRY,"Well, you were gonna live in the closet anyway. Won't you be just as happy back in your old place?",FRY
603,BENDER,"But, then we wouldn't be roommates.",BENDER
604,FRY,I'll come visit sometime. And you can visit me here.,FRY
606,FRY,"Anyway, I'm sure it'll work out. This way we'll both be happy.",FRY
607,BENDER,"(downbeat) Happy. Yeah, that's Bender. Always happy.",BENDER
617,FRY,"Hey, thanks for coming.",FRY
618,LEELA,"Fry, you're Bender's best friend. How could you let that mob kick him out?",LEELA
619,FRY,"Ah, come on. Bender loves mobs.",FRY
620,LEELA,Only when he's in them and you know it. You really hurt his feelings.,LEELA
621,FRY,Don't girl me with that girl stuff. Bender and me are guys. Guys don't have feelings.,FRY
622,LEELA,"Bender's not a guy, he's a robot.",LEELA
625,BENDER,"My roommate's gone. And all he left behind was an eyelash and three skin flakes.  Oh, what's the point?!",BENDER
626,LEELA,"Bender?  My God, you're a mess!",LEELA
628,LEELA,"Look at that five o'clock rust. You've been up all night not drinking, haven't you?",LEELA
629,BENDER,Hey. What I don't do is none of your business.,BENDER
630,LEELA,"Please, Bender. Have some malt liquor. If not for yourself then for the people who love you.",LEELA
631,BENDER,I hate the people who love me and they hate me.,BENDER
632,LEELA,"Oh, now look. It's obvious you miss being Fry's roommate. But there's got to be a better way to deal with this.",LEELA
633,BENDER,Like how? Having my antenna removed?,BENDER
634,LEELA,"Well, if that would work.",LEELA
635,BENDER,Are you crazy? That's Little Bender you're talking about. I can't cut it off. You're not a robot or a man so you wouldn't understand. I gotta get out of here.,BENDER
636,LEELA,Wait! I want you to look me in the eye and promise you won't get behind the wheel without some kind of alcoholic beverage in your hand.,LEELA
639,LEELA,I can't just stand by and be silent about Bender anymore.,LEELA
640,FRY,Silent? You've been meddling for two solid weeks.,FRY
641,LEELA,Well I can't just do that anymore. Your best friend is out there somewhere destroying himself.,LEELA
642,FRY,Really? I didn't think he'd miss this apartment that much.,FRY
643,LEELA,"He doesn't care about the apartment, he cares about you. And you turned your back on him.",LEELA
644,FRY,"Oh, man. I had no idea. If only I knew where he was I'd go talk to him.",FRY
645,FRY,"Oh, stupid TV!  Bender! You're blind stinking sober!",FRY
646,BENDER,That's right! I'm sober and crazy and I don't know what I might do!,BENDER
648,BENDER,"I don't know what it is yet. Oh, yeah, now I remember. I thought I could live alone, but I can't. So, I'm gonna do what it takes to be your roommate again.",BENDER
650,FRY,Cutting Leela's head off won't solve anything!,FRY
651,BENDER,"No, I'm going to chop off my antenna.",BENDER
652,FRY,"Hey, yeah! That sounds good. Can I give you a hand?",FRY
653,LEELA,"Fry, don't help him mutilate himself.",LEELA
654,FRY,But it's a useless antenna. It's not like he's a ham radio or something.,FRY
655,BENDER,I'm gonna do it! I'm really gonna do it! Don't try and stop me! Here goes.,BENDER
656,FRY,"Hey, it works! The static's gone.",FRY
661,LEELA,You guys could learn a lesson from those two.,LEELA
663,BENDER,"You're my best friend, Fry, I'm sorry I treated you so badly.",BENDER
664,FRY,"Apology accepted. After all, you're only human.",FRY
665,LEELA,"Wait a minute! You did it all backwards. Fry's the one who should be......Oh, never mind!",LEELA
667,BENDER,Nothing. I guess I'm just going to have to get used to being half a robot.,BENDER
668,FRY,"Aww, this isn't right. Listen, Bender, if we found your antenna could they still reattach it?",FRY
669,BENDER,Maybe. If we get it on ice right away.,BENDER
672,BENDER,"This time, you'll have all the human comfort. We'll get a couple of toilets, some food cookers, maybe a puppy.",BENDER
674,BENDER,"It sure is. By the way, I saved your stuff.",BENDER
675,FRY,"So that's where those skin flakes went. Hmm, do you think this fruit tree's going to get enough light?",FRY
676,BENDER,There's a window in the closet.,BENDER
677,FRY,"This is huge! Bender, why don't I just live in here?",FRY
678,BENDER,"In a closet? Oh, humans!",BENDER
681,LEELA,This place was a great choice. The food is amazing. And such generous portions.,LEELA
683,LEELA,"You know, Doug, most guys are put off by my eye. It's nice to finally meet someone who's open-minded.  Ew!",LEELA
684,FRY,What was wrong with your date last night?,FRY
685,LEELA,I don't know. Something I couldn’t quite put my finger on. Possibly his vile lizard tongue.,LEELA
687,FRY,"Yeah. If you rule out every guy with a lizard tongue or a low I.Q. or an explosive violent temper, of course you're gonna be lonely.",FRY
688,LEELA,There's nothing wrong with having high standards. Now can we please stop --,LEELA
691,LEELA,"Thank you all for the inspiring advice, but I'm perfectly happy with my life the way it is.",LEELA
692,BENDER,That sounds like a cry for help.,BENDER
699,FRY,Why's everyone wearing those rings?,FRY
701,FRY,I think they look cool.,FRY
709,LEELA,What?! How can you tell?,LEELA
710,BENDER,I just know these things. I've got what they call gaydar.,BENDER
712,BENDER,"No?  OK, I got a lock on him.  Yep! He's gay!",BENDER
714,BENDER,Definitely. Unless I'm getting interference from a gay weather balloon.,BENDER
716,FRY,No way! We've got so much in common.,FRY
718,FRY,"Uh, yeah! That rings a bell.",FRY
721,BENDER,(whispering) I think she means 10 wins on the gay circuit.,BENDER
724,LEELA,That's great - really - but he's just not what I'm looking for.,LEELA
727,BENDER,Just as well; I think he comes from a dimension that's big on musical theatre.,BENDER
728,FRY,"Psst, I need the apartment tonight. Go see a saucy puppet show.",FRY
731,BENDER,"So, Leela, you must have had your pick of the litter last night at closing time.",BENDER
732,LEELA,Could you guys please stop talking about my personal life?,LEELA
733,FARNSWORTH,"Yes, let's all talk about Leela's personal life later. But right now we have business to attend to.",FARNSWORTH
735,FARNSWORTH,No. A tax-deductible mission of charity.,FARNSWORTH
739,FARNSWORTH,"It's a sunny little doomed planet, inhabited by a number of frisky little doomed animals.",FARNSWORTH
741,FARNSWORTH,"That's right. Animals in desperate need of rescue. You see, Vergon 6 was once filled with a super dense substance known as dark matter, each pound of which weighs over ten thousand pounds.",FARNSWORTH
742,LEELA,Wait! What about the animals?,LEELA
743,FARNSWORTH,"Well, dark matter is extremely valuable as starship fuel. That's why it was all mined out, leaving the planet completely hollow.",FARNSWORTH
744,LEELA,"Yes, but what about the animals?",LEELA
747,FARNSWORTH,"I didn't say anything about animals. Now it seems that the planet will collapse within three days. Incidentally, this will kill all the animals.",FARNSWORTH
748,LEELA,So we have to bring back two of each kind. Just like Noah's Ark.,LEELA
750,FRY,I bet you Leela's holding out for a nice guy with one eye.,FRY
751,BENDER,"That'll take forever. What she oughta do is find a nice guy with two eyes, then poke one out.",BENDER
752,FRY,"Yeah, that'd be a timesaver.",FRY
754,BENDER,Here you go.  You can use this as an eye-poker.,BENDER
755,LEELA,"Thank you. But I don't care how many eyes a man has - as long as it's less than five. All I'm looking for is a guy who's adventurous, self-confident...",LEELA
756,LEELA,...maybe a snappy dresser.,LEELA
763,LEELA,"Hey, look! That's Zapp Brannigan's ship.",LEELA
764,FRY,Wow! The Zapp Brannigan?,FRY
766,FRY,Who's the Zapp Brannigan?,FRY
769,LEELA,They say Zapp Brannigan single-handedly saved the Octillian system from a horde of rampaging Killbots.,LEELA
771,BENDER,"A grim day for robot-kind. Ah, but we can always build more Killbots!",BENDER
772,LEELA,He's the most decorated captain in the whole Democratic Order Of Planets.,LEELA
773,FRY,(teasing) Leela's got a boyfriend!,FRY
774,LEELA,No I don't. But I think we ought to meet with him and see if he'll help us rescue those animals.,LEELA
775,BENDER,Well just in case you guys hit it off you'll wanna take this with you.,BENDER
780,LEELA,"Hello, I'm Leela, captain of the Planet Express delivery ship. We've come aboard to plead for your assistance.",LEELA
783,LEELA,"Oh, not at all. I'm just so uh...really thrilled to meet you!",LEELA
785,LEELA,(flattered) You don't mean that!,LEELA
787,FRY,I heard that one time you single-handedly defeated a horde of rampaging somethings in the something something system.,FRY
789,FRY,Wow! I never would have thought of that!,FRY
792,LEELA,"Captain Brannigan, we really need to talk to you about our mission.",LEELA
795,LEELA,We're hoping to save the animals of Vergon 6 from extinction. And if you could just --,LEELA
799,LEELA,But people already interfered. That planet was mined completely hollow.,LEELA
801,LEELA,This doesn't make any sense.,LEELA
803,LEELA,Fine! We'll save the animals without your help.,LEELA
806,BENDER,He's throwing us in prison.,BENDER
807,FRY,Dang! Can I get this wrapped up?,FRY
808,LEELA,Ow! I might've liked Zapp Brannigan if he weren't a pompous dimwit who threw me in prison.,LEELA
809,BENDER,You really are too picky.,BENDER
824,LEELA,"Good. This will be my chance to reason with him, captain to captain.",LEELA
828,LEELA,I didn't realise you were such a coin-a-sewer.,LEELA
832,LEELA,...if we could speak seriously for a moment...,LEELA
834,LEELA,...I'd like you to reconsider letting us rescue those animals.,LEELA
838,FRY,"We can definitely escape, Bender. All you have to do is bend the hatch off this steam pipe.",FRY
840,FRY,No good! It's full of steam!,FRY
842,LEELA,I'm not really in the mood.,LEELA
844,LEELA,Can I please just go back to prison?,LEELA
846,LEELA,Much rather!  What are you doing?,LEELA
848,LEELA,"No, and it's pronounced ""sham-pane"".",LEELA
856,LEELA,"Oh, come on, cheer up, it's not that bad.",LEELA
857,FRY,You wanna try escaping again?,FRY
859,FRY,"Man, Leela's been gone a long time. I hope she's at least making progress with Zapp Brannigan.",FRY
863,LEELA,"Zapp, last night was a mistake.",LEELA
865,LEELA,"No, just a regular mistake. For a split second my common sense was overwhelmed by pity.",LEELA
867,LEELA,The only kind of crawling I'm doing to you is away - from!,LEELA
869,LEELA,"Look, I'm going down to Vergon 6 to save those animals whether you like it or not.",LEELA
871,LEELA,"Threaten all you -- wait, what?",LEELA
882,BENDER,So should we get our stuff and head down to the planet?,BENDER
883,LEELA,"(defensively) We just talked, OK?!",LEELA
884,LEELA,Alright. We don't have much time to collect these animals. The planet is supposed to collapse in approximately two hours ago.,LEELA
885,LEELA,"Hello there.  Hmm, he doesn't seem to be on the checklist.",LEELA
886,BENDER,So you're saying we can cook him?,BENDER
887,FRY,"Yeah, a barbecue! I'll wear my hilarious apron.",FRY
888,LEELA,"No! I don't care how hilarious your apron is, we're not cooking him.  Aww, I'll call him Nibbler.",LEELA
889,BENDER,Aww! (whispering to Fry) I'll fire up the grill!,BENDER
890,LEELA,I hope he'll be OK in there with all those big animals.,LEELA
894,BENDER,I found a pair of Hermaphlamingoes.,BENDER
895,LEELA,Good. That's the last species.,LEELA
899,FRY,I can't believe we flew halfway across the galaxy and enjoyed a steam just to get lunch for that stupid animal!,FRY
900,BENDER,He's pending for a bending.,BENDER
901,LEELA,"Leave him alone. It's not his fault that he's an unstoppable killing machine. Is it, snoogums?",LEELA
902,FRY,The planet's kerploding!,FRY
903,LEELA,"Prepare for lift-off.  We're out of fuel. Bender, I told you to fill the tank before we left.",LEELA
904,BENDER,"Yeah, I'll do it when we get back.",BENDER
905,FRY,"Man, lucky for us Zapp Brannigan's nearby.",FRY
906,LEELA,"No way, forget it! I refuse to go crawling back to him!",LEELA
907,FRY,What? What are you talking about?,FRY
908,LEELA,(defensively) Nothing. We just talked.,LEELA
909,BENDER,"So what's your problem? It's not like you slept with him.  Oh, my God!",BENDER
910,FRY,"How could you, Leela? I thought you had some standards. I mean, jeez, he's a dumb, gross gorilla!",FRY
911,LEELA,That's enough. Don't you think I feel bad enough already?,LEELA
913,LEELA,"Alright, alright I'll call him.  I mean if living is that important to you.",LEELA
917,LEELA,"Zapp, we're out of fuel...",LEELA
918,LEELA,...and Vergon 6 is about to implode. We need your help.,LEELA
922,LEELA,"Look, are you going to rescue us or not?",LEELA
928,LEELA,"I would never abandon a helpless animal. Y'know, Zapp, once I thought you were a big pompous buffoon. Then I realised that inside you were just a pitiful child. But now I realise that outside that child is a big pompous buffoon!",LEELA
930,FRY,"Wow, way to tell that guy off. Now what's your secret escape plan?",FRY
931,LEELA,"Uh, I guess to sit here and wait for death.",LEELA
933,BENDER,What the hell was that?,BENDER
935,LEELA,I don't believe it! It's dark matter.,LEELA
936,BENDER,So this guy just unloaded a steaming pile of starship fuel?,BENDER
937,LEELA,"His species must've filled the entire planet with it. Did you do that, you cute little --  Come on. That should be more than enough fuel to get us outta here. Bender, pick it up and put it in the engine.",LEELA
938,LEELA,We made it!  And some of the animals survived.,LEELA
939,BENDER,So a couple of animals didn't die and Leela got lucky. That's what I call a successful mission!,BENDER
941,LEELA,(thinking) Dear Captain's Diary. I may not have found love on this mission but I did find a cute little companion who excretes starship fuel. And that's just as good.,LEELA
948,LEELA,"What do you think of the view, Fry?",LEELA
949,FRY,"It really puts things in perspective. I mean, from up here an entire world can seem utterly insignificant.",FRY
950,BENDER,"Hey, nice seats! We're close enough to when you knock a player down with a beer bottle, he stays down.",BENDER
951,FRY,I don't get this. Is blernsball exactly the same as baseball?,FRY
953,LEELA,"Face it, Fry. Baseball was as boring as mom and apple pie. That's why they jazzed it up.",LEELA
954,FRY,"Boring? Baseball wasn't -- hmm, so they finally jazzed it up?",FRY
955,FRY,Home run! Ha ha! Yay! Right?,FRY
957,FRY,What just happened? Why is the ball on that springy thing?,FRY
958,LEELA,It's traditional. Just like aluminium bats and the seventh inning grope.,LEELA
959,BENDER,"I got me a souvenir!  Aww, here you go, kid!",BENDER
965,FRY,"Mmm, at least hotdogs haven't changed.",FRY
966,BENDER,"Hey, buddies, who wants popcorn?",BENDER
970,BENDER,Anyone want butter on that?,BENDER
971,FRY,"Hey, I'm starting to get the hang of this game. The blerns are loaded, the count's three blerns and two anti-blerns and the infield blern rule is in effect, right?",FRY
972,LEELA,"Except for the word ""blern"" that was complete gibberish.",LEELA
974,LEELA,Alright! Yes! Miller's on a pace to hit 70 blerns!,LEELA
975,FARNSWORTH,"He's good, alright. But he's no Clem Johnson. And Johnson played back in the days before steroid injections were mandatory.",FARNSWORTH
976,BENDER,"Clem Johnson? That skin bag wouldn't have lasted one pitch in the old Robot Leagues! Now Wireless Joe Jackson, there was a blern hitting machine!",BENDER
977,LEELA,"Exactly! He was a machine designed to hit blerns! I mean, come on, Wireless Joe was nothing but a programmable bat on wheels.",LEELA
978,BENDER,"Oh, and I suppose Pitchomat 5000 was just a modified howitzer?",BENDER
980,BENDER,You humans are so scared of a little robot competition you won't even let us on the field.,BENDER
981,FRY,What are you talking about? There's all kinds of robots down there.,FRY
982,BENDER,"Yeah, doing crap work! They're bat boys, ball polishers, sprinkler systems. But how many robot managers are there?",BENDER
984,BENDER,Zero!  And what a surprise! Look who's scraping up the filth. Is it a human child? I wish!,BENDER
991,BENDER,Admit it: You all think robots are just machines built by humans to make their lives easier.,BENDER
993,BENDER,I've never made anyone's life easier and you know it!,BENDER
994,FARNSWORTH,"Great news, everyone. You'll be delivering a package to Chapek 9, a world where humans are killed on sight.",FARNSWORTH
995,FRY,Why is that great news?,FRY
996,FARNSWORTH,"I'm glad you asked that question, Fry. You see, Chapek 9 was colonised centuries ago by a murderous crew of radical robot separatists.",FARNSWORTH
997,BENDER,"Oh, so just 'cause a robot wants to kill humans that makes him a ""radical""?",BENDER
998,LEELA,"Hey, hold on. I understand these robots hate humans, but how do they feel about humanoid aliens?",LEELA
1001,BENDER,"Oh, I get it, make the robot do all the work!",BENDER
1002,LEELA,This is the first actual work you've ever had to do around here.,LEELA
1003,BENDER,Well I'm not doing it! It's a robot holiday.,BENDER
1005,BENDER,Only Robanukah. The holiest two weeks on the robot calendar.,BENDER
1006,LEELA,"Oh, come on, Bender. Last month it was Robomadom and before that Robonza.",LEELA
1007,FRY,"Man, that one was a blast!",FRY
1008,BENDER,It wasn't just a blast. It was a sacred tribute to my ancestral prototypes which happened to take the form of a drinking contest.,BENDER
1010,BENDER,"Alright, I'll go. But so help me, I'll hold a grudge against every last stinking one of you for the rest of your lives.",BENDER
1011,FARNSWORTH,"Well then it's settled. So long, everyone!",FARNSWORTH
1012,FRY,So let me get this straight: This planet is completely uninhabited?,FRY
1013,BENDER,No. It's inhabited by robots!,BENDER
1014,FRY,Oh. Kinda like how a warehouse is inhabited by boxes.,FRY
1015,LEELA,"OK, Bender, we're here. It's time to get to work.",LEELA
1016,BENDER,"Yes, Miss Leela. Tote that space barge, lift that space pale.",BENDER
1017,LEELA,"Now we can't land on the surface because those robots will kill Fry and me. So we'll have to stay up here and lower you with the winch. And remember: You don't know humans, you don't work for humans, and, above all, you don't like humans.",LEELA
1018,BENDER,(ironic) I'll try to keep that in mind!,BENDER
1019,LEELA,"Hmm, he seems pretty angry.",LEELA
1020,FRY,"Yeah, but I guess I'd be kinda angry too if I had to go to some uninhabited planet.",FRY
1021,LEELA,Maybe we ought to do something nice for him.,LEELA
1022,LEELA,There! This oughta show that stupid robot we care about him.,LEELA
1023,FRY,"Ah, Bender must be done with the delivery.",FRY
1024,BENDER,"I'm in trouble. They found out I work with humans and -- oh, no! Oh, no!",BENDER
1025,FRY,"Oh, my God! We have to go down and rescue him.",FRY
1026,LEELA,"No, we can't! They'll kill us on sight.",LEELA
1027,FRY,W-what are we gonna do?,FRY
1028,LEELA,I don't know! I don't know! It's not an easy decision. If only I had two or three minutes to think about it.,LEELA
1029,LEELA,"OK. If we're going to save Bender, we've got to look and act exactly like robots.",LEELA
1030,FRY,"(mechanical voice) I am fully operational, captain.",FRY
1031,LEELA,"We'll have to walk like robots, talk like robots and, if necessary, solve complex differential equations like robots.",LEELA
1032,FRY,I can sorta dance like a robot. Will that help?,FRY
1033,LEELA,"Fry, first of all this is serious. And second of all:",LEELA
1034,FRY,"Man, we look stupid. We should've gotten store-bought costumes.",FRY
1035,LEELA,"Yeah, but there wasn't a Woolworth's in this quadrant.",LEELA
1039,FRY,"Uh, yup! Just two robots out roboting it up!  Eh?",FRY
1043,FRY,(whispering) C!  (talking) Is the puppy mechanical in any way?,FRY
1045,LEELA,Then we'll go with that data file.,LEELA
1049,LEELA,"Now if you see any robots, just stay out of their way.  (shouting) So far, so good.",LEELA
1051,LEELA,Have you seen this robot?,LEELA
1053,LEELA,"Come on, Fry, walk like a robot.",LEELA
1054,FRY,I can't. I have to go to the bathroom.,FRY
1055,LEELA,Robots don't have bathrooms.,LEELA
1056,FRY,"Oh, right. I wonder where they smoke in high school.",FRY
1057,LEELA,Listen. Just go behind those garbage cans. I'll stand guard.,LEELA
1062,FRY,"I think the leak's stopping itself. Wait. Wait. Yeah, there we go. Wait. Yeah!",FRY
1064,LEELA,I'm sorry. My friend and I have to go and perform some mindless repetitive tasks.,LEELA
1069,LEELA,Quick! Let's duck in here!,LEELA
1081,LEELA,OK. Keep an eye out for Bender.,LEELA
1083,FRY,"Umm, too much romance, not enough human killing.",FRY
1087,LEELA,Try to stay with the crowd so no one notices how crummy you look.,LEELA
1095,FRY,Ahh! It's good to hear his voice!,FRY
1096,BENDER,"Many said I was too extreme when I first called for the annihilation of the human species, as well as some of the more cunning monkeys. But after living on Earth I can tell you that I am, if anything, too merciful!",BENDER
1097,FRY,My God! He's become evil.  I mean eviler!,FRY
1098,BENDER,"Thank you! Thank you! And if you enjoyed that diatribe then you'll want to purchase my spoken word album, just 18.95! Act now and you'll get this Bender action figurine.",BENDER
1099,BENDER FIGURINE,Bite my shiny metal ass!,BENDER
1102,BENDER,"Now, your basic human is between three- and 25-feet tall and is made of a hairy, oily goo wrapped in a t-shirt.",BENDER
1106,BENDER,Nothing. Today's active humans prefer a low-calorie bait.,BENDER
1110,BENDER,"Hmm, sounds like a breeding ground for humans. I'd better check it out.",BENDER
1111,BENDER,"Oh, yeah! You're a bad girl, aren't you?",BENDER
1113,BENDER,Huh? Wha? You! What the hell are you doing here?,BENDER
1114,FRY,We've been looking for you. Last we heard you were under arrest as a human sympathiser.,FRY
1115,BENDER,I was. But they let me go when I told them I killed a million billion humans.,BENDER
1116,LEELA,Good for you. Now let's all get back to the ship.,LEELA
1119,BENDER,I don't wanna be rescued.,BENDER
1121,BENDER,"I love this planet. I've got wealth, fame and access to the depths of sleaze that those things bring.",BENDER
1122,FRY,"But, Bender, we're your friends.",FRY
1123,BENDER,Friends? That activates my hilarity unit! I'm just a machine to you. You're no more friends with me than you are with the toaster or the phonograph or the electric chair.,BENDER
1125,BENDER,Well that's how it feels to me.,BENDER
1126,FRY,"Bye, Bender. I'll miss you.",FRY
1127,BENDER,"Go on, get out of here before you get caught.",BENDER
1131,BENDER,Uh...got you...you murderous flesh piles!,BENDER
1134,FRY,"Hey, wait a minute! Isn't anyone going to defend us?",FRY
1135,LEELA,Yeah! I mean he might not have a case but I'm genuinely not a human.,LEELA
1142,FRY,Call technical support.,FRY
1146,LEELA,Look! One eye! Count them: One! Not human!,LEELA
1153,FRY,You don't look very old.,FRY
1157,BENDER,"Alright, let's make this quick, I'm due at the opening of a mini-mall. Hey! What is this?",BENDER
1159,FRY,But the judge already sentenced us at the trial!,FRY
1164,BENDER,"Uh, I'm a little tired right now. Would it be alright if I just gave 'em a savage beating?",BENDER
1168,BENDER,"Aww!  I can't kill them. Plenty of humans have mistreated robots but not these two. They're my friends. Humans are no threat to us. They're stupid, putrid cowards.",BENDER
1170,BENDER,"The fact is, humans are completely harmless.",BENDER
1178,BENDER,"Well, I'm glad we got all that out in the open. We'll just let ourselves out.",BENDER
1181,FRY,Stop! Take one more step and I'll breathe fire on you!,FRY
1182,LEELA,He'll do it. He's crazy!,LEELA
1187,FRY,"So long, suckers!  Uh, hello, suckers!",FRY
1188,BENDER,"Hey, hold on a second, I forgot to deliver the package.",BENDER
1191,BENDER,"Wow, I can't believe you guys did all this for me! This is the best Robanukah ever!",BENDER
1192,FRY,We wanted to show you that we really do respect your robot heritage.,FRY
1193,BENDER,"Aww, thanks! You do know that I made Robanukah up to get out of work, right?",BENDER
1195,FRY,But that doesn't make it any less meaningful.,FRY
1196,BENDER,"In that case, let the dancing begin! Hey, you guys are good. How the hell do you do that?",BENDER
1199,FRY,"I can't take it anymore! They've been at it for hours!  (shouting) Give it a rest, you two!",FRY
1202,FRY,"Uh, excuse me? I missed a few lectures. Uh, what subject is this?",FRY
1207,FRY,What a weird dream! I'll never get back to sleep.,FRY
1208,FRY,So you're telling me they broadcast commercials into people's dreams?,FRY
1210,FRY,"But, how is that possible?",FRY
1211,FARNSWORTH,"It's very simple. The ad gets into your brain just like this liquid gets into this egg.  Although in reality it's not liquid, but gamma radiation.",FARNSWORTH
1212,FRY,That's awful. It's like brainwashing.,FRY
1213,LEELA,Didn't you have ads in the 20th century?,LEELA
1214,FRY,"Well, sure, but not in our dreams. Only on TV and radio. And in magazines and movies and at ball games and on buses and milk cartons and t-shirts and written in the sky. But not in dreams. No siree!",FRY
1215,BENDER,"Quit squawking, flesh wad, nobody's forcing you to buy anything.",BENDER
1222,FRY,Cool.  Can I try these on before I buy them?,FRY
1226,BENDER,New? What sweater? I came in with it. I don't know you people!,BENDER
1228,FRY,$30? I can't afford that. Unless... Do you take Visa?,FRY
1235,FRY,"No, I can't afford them. Being poor sucks. What kind of world is this where they advertise things not everybody can afford?",FRY
1238,FRY,Hey who's the rocker jockey?,FRY
1244,FRY,"Hey, Bender. Sounds like you could use a little of that oil.",FRY
1247,BENDER,"Uh, there's obviously been some sort of a mistake here.  I'm sure there's......I say I'm sure there's......that is, I'm sure there's...a very...reasonable...",BENDER
1249,FRY,"78, 79. 79.50. Crud! We're 50 cents short.",FRY
1250,LEELA,"I'd love to chip in, but Bender stole my wallet.",LEELA
1251,FRY,"Hey, that's my old bank. Maybe my account's still open.",FRY
1253,FRY,"Yeah, well, I did open the account over a thousand years ago. What about my ATM card?",FRY
1255,FRY,"Sure! It's the price of a cheese pizza and a large soda back where I used to work, Panucci's Pizza.",FRY
1261,LEELA,"I know Fry's rich, but do we really have to wear these top hats?",LEELA
1262,BENDER,"Maybe you don't understand just how rich he is. In fact, I think I'd better put on a monocle.",BENDER
1263,FRY,Pizza dinner on me!  Just keep the tab under $50 million.,FRY
1265,FRY,"Uh, yeah. We'll have one with everything but anchovies and one with my all time favourite topping, anchovies!",FRY
1267,FRY,Anchovies? You know? Those little headless fish?,FRY
1269,FARNSWORTH,"I'm sorry, Fry, but the anchovy has been extinct since the 2200's.",FARNSWORTH
1271,FARNSWORTH,"Oh, my, yes. Fished to death. Just about the time your people arrived on Earth wasn't it, Zoidberg?",FARNSWORTH
1273,FRY,"So none of you has ever had anchovies? Oh, man! You don't know what you're missing. They were all salty and oily and they melted in your mouth and --",FRY
1275,FRY,I just wished I could've showed you guys how great they were. I may be rich but I still can't buy back all the things I miss from the 20th century.,FRY
1276,BENDER,Maybe you're forgetting just how rich you are.  Huh? Huh?,BENDER
1278,LEELA,"I know you spent a lot of money on this place, Fry, but it's awfully primitive. The floors are made of such hard wood.",LEELA
1279,BENDER,Hey! Get a load of this pathetic 20th century TV!,BENDER
1281,BENDER,"Well, aside from causing eye cancer, these things had a lousy low-definition picture.",BENDER
1286,LEELA,"I just don't get it. Who was this Ted Danson? And why would you pay $10,000 for his skeleton?",LEELA
1287,FRY,I have an idea for a sitcom.,FRY
1288,BENDER,"Ah, leave him alone, Leela. So he's going a little wacko with his money. It's OK.",BENDER
1289,LEELA,You're just saying that because he bought you that antique robot toy.,LEELA
1298,LEELA,Are you crazy? It's a can of old fish.,LEELA
1299,FRY,Don't tell me how to spend my money.,FRY
1302,LEELA,"Oh, my God, it's Mom! I've never seen her in person before.",LEELA
1304,LEELA,"Fry, you can't bid against Mom. She's the richest, most powerful person in the world. And she's so adorable.",LEELA
1314,FRY,"Oh. In that case, 50 million.",FRY
1319,FRY,Now for some good old 20th century TV.,FRY
1321,FRY,"Ah, those were the days.",FRY
1325,LEELA,You haven't been to work in three days. What have you been doing?,LEELA
1326,FRY,I've been sitting right here. I picked up my life exactly where I left off a thousand years ago. Now if you'll excuse me it's 8 o'clock. Time to get biz-ay!,FRY
1327,LEELA,You can't just sit here in the dark listening to classical music.,LEELA
1328,FRY,I could if you hadn't turned on the lights and shut off the stereo.,FRY
1329,LEELA,"Fry, this isn't healthy. You're living in the past.",LEELA
1330,FRY,I'm rich! I can live whenever I want.,FRY
1331,LEELA,But we're your friends and we live here in the year 3000.,LEELA
1332,BENDER,Yeah. Now are you gonna come to the squid fights with us or sit here wallowing in your prehistoric junk?,BENDER
1333,FRY,"Junk? Maybe you can't understand this but I've finally found what I need to be happy, and it's not friends: It's things.",FRY
1336,LEELA,Fry please.   My ponytail's caught in the door.,LEELA
1337,FRY,"I don't need them. Not when I have my antique videos, my bucket of fossilised KFC and 50 million dollars worth of anchovies.",FRY
1362,FRY [ON TV],"Sure! It's the price of a cheese pizza and a large soda back where I used to work, Panucci's Pizza.  It's the price of a cheese pizza and a large soda --",FRY
1374,FRY,"That sounds like me but, I thought I got frozen. Wasn't I in the future?",FRY
1376,FRY,"So I'm really back? That's exactly what I wanted, I guess. Who are you?",FRY
1378,FRY,You are? Did you grow a moustache since last night?,FRY
1392,FRY,Wait. You're Pamela Anderson! Cool! What can I get you?,FRY
1396,FRY,"Uh, cheese and a --  That was quick!",FRY
1398,FRY,10.77. Same as my PIN number.,FRY
1404,FRY,"Oh, I had a nightmare I was in the year 2000 and you guys never existed. I'm so glad I'm awake now and you're really here.",FRY
1405,LEELA,Since when do you care about us?,LEELA
1406,BENDER,We thought you only cared about cans of anchovies and stuffy old songs about the buttocks.,BENDER
1411,FRY,"Bender! Leela! Don't leave me. Wait a minute! Hey, buddy what year is this?",FRY
1413,FRY,3000? Yes! I'm still in the future! Life is wonderful!  Wait! What are you doing with my stuff?,FRY
1415,FRY,"Oh, no, my ATM card! My secret PIN number! 1077. I've got nothing left. Except...",FRY
1416,LEELA,You're Fry's relative. Do you have any idea how he got so crazy?,LEELA
1417,FARNSWORTH,"Uh, wha? Oh, yes, they say madness runs in our family. Some even call me mad! And why? Because I dared to dream of my own race of atomic monsters. Atomic supermen with octagonal-shaped bodies that suck blood out of...",FARNSWORTH
1418,FRY,Leela! Bender! I missed you so much!,FRY
1419,LEELA,You did? What happened?,LEELA
1420,FRY,I was robbed. They got everything except these.,FRY
1425,FRY,Sorry. But the anchovies aren't for sale.,FRY
1427,FRY,"You might as well put that chequebook away, because I've discovered something even more important. My friends. And they aren't worth even a penny to me. That's why these anchovies are going on a pizza, so I can share the food I love with the people I like.",FRY
1430,FRY,"OK, my friends. Get ready for the most delicious extinct animal you've ever tasted.",FRY
1432,FRY,"Ah, no one likes them at first but they'll grow on you.",FRY
1434,FRY,There aren't any more. And there never will be.,FRY
1438,BENDER,(singing) Going through the 'bot wash!,BENDER
1439,BENDER,(singing) Goin' through the robot wash!,BENDER
1442,FRY,"Hey, what you watching?",FRY
1444,LEELA,Is that a cooking show?,LEELA
1445,BENDER,"No, of course not! It was...uh...porno! Yeah that's it!",BENDER
1446,LEELA,Bender! I didn't know you liked cooking! That's so cute!,LEELA
1447,BENDER,"(ashamed) Oh, it's true! I've been hiding it for so long.",BENDER
1448,FRY,"Its OK, Bender, I like cooking too.",FRY
1452,BENDER,You call that a couch? I demand a pillow!,BENDER
1455,FRY,You're gonna be the ship's cook?,FRY
1456,BENDER,Yeah! We're gonna kick it up a notch. Bam!,BENDER
1457,LEELA,"I know you like cooking shows but you're a robot, you don't even have a sense of taste.",LEELA
1458,BENDER,"Honey, I wouldn't talk about taste if I was wearing a lime green tank top.",BENDER
1460,FRY,So this is Little Neptune?,FRY
1461,BENDER,Yep. Every chef knows that this is the place to get exotic gourmet ingredients.,BENDER
1467,FRY,Wait a minute! This says Z-Ray.,FRY
1469,FRY,"Hmm, I can see where that would be an advantage. Do you take cash?",FRY
1470,LEELA,"Fry, you have to be more careful. We're not in the 20th century. You don't know how things work here.",LEELA
1471,FRY,"I'm not a little kid, Leela. I grew up in this city. These are my people. What up?",FRY
1474,FRY,Wow! You guys sell every kind of meat here except human!,FRY
1476,LEELA,Oh! That's ridiculous. (whispering) I'll take two pounds!,LEELA
1477,BENDER,"Hey, buddy. I'm looking for fresh slug.",BENDER
1479,BENDER,"Yeah, yeah, either one's fine.",BENDER
1480,LEELA,"Hey, have you seen Fry?",LEELA
1481,FRY,"Now that you mention it, I do have trouble breathing underwater sometimes. I'll take the gills.",FRY
1483,FRY,Can't imagine why I would.,FRY
1488,LEELA,What the hell were you doing? I warned you to stay away from those guys.,LEELA
1489,FRY,"I'm capable of making my own decisions, Leela. Did you ever stop to think I might be happier with gills?",FRY
1491,BENDER,"Uh-oh, I don't like the sound of that.",BENDER
1492,FARNSWORTH,...you'll be making a delivery to the planet Trisol...,FARNSWORTH
1494,FARNSWORTH,...A mysterious world in the darkest depths of the Forbidden Zone.,FARNSWORTH
1495,BENDER,"Thank you, and goodnight.",BENDER
1496,LEELA,"Uh, Professor, are we even allowed in the Forbidden Zone?",LEELA
1497,FARNSWORTH,"Why, of course! Its just a name! Like the Death Zone or the Zone Of No Return. All the zones have names like that in the Galaxy Of Terror!",FARNSWORTH
1499,FARNSWORTH,"Off you go, pleasant trip.",FARNSWORTH
1500,FRY,(shouting) Hey Bender how's dinner coming?,FRY
1502,BENDER,Now for a dash of salt!  Uh-oh!,BENDER
1503,LEELA,"(whispering) Listen, this is Bender's first meal and he's a little sensitive. So let's be supportive, OK?",LEELA
1506,LEELA,"(shouting) Oh, dear God!",LEELA
1507,FRY,That's the saltiest thing I've ever tasted. And I once a big heaping bowl of salt!,FRY
1509,BENDER,It's salt with water in it if that's what you mean.,BENDER
1510,FRY,My vision's fading. I think I'm gonna die.,FRY
1511,BENDER,There was nothing wrong with that food. The salt level was 10% less than a lethal dose.,BENDER
1513,LEELA,"OK, Fry, here's the package to deliver and for once in your life be careful. This is my first visit to the Galaxy Of Terror and I'd like it to be a pleasant one.",LEELA
1515,LEELA,"Don't touch anything or talk to anyone. Just go to the palace, drop it off and come right back.",LEELA
1516,FRY,"Jeez, will you lay off! I was delivering things before you were born! I think I know what I'm doing.",FRY
1517,FRY,"Stupid slug. I've never been so thirsty. Oh, come on! Go down already!  Ah!",FRY
1523,FRY,I didn't mean to. He just looked so cool and refreshing.,FRY
1527,LEELA,"So after I specifically asked you not to touch anything, you drank a bottle of strange blue liquid? It could have been poisonous acid!",LEELA
1528,FRY,It could have been. But chances were equally good it was an Emperor.,FRY
1533,BENDER,"You know, Fry, I've often thought about becoming a Prime Minister.",BENDER
1534,FRY,I gotta go with Bender.,FRY
1535,BENDER,"Yes! In your face, Gorgak!",BENDER
1536,LEELA,"That's it, Fry. As your captain I order you back to the ship. You are in way over your head.",LEELA
1537,FRY,"Gee, you think so, Captain? I'd better check with my Prime Minister.",FRY
1540,FRY,"Hey, thanks!  Wow! This got here just in time.",FRY
1542,FRY,"Umm, how about that one?",FRY
1544,FRY,"On second thought, I'll take that one.",FRY
1546,LEELA,"Does anyone else think it's odd that a shiftless 25-year-old delivery boy could drop out of the sky, kill the emperor and be rewarded instead of punished?",LEELA
1547,FRY,"You don't have to beat around the bush, Leela, we all know who you're talking about...uh, me, right?",FRY
1554,FRY,"There won't be a lot of long-winded speeches, will there?",FRY
1562,FRY,"Oh, yeah! Yeah, he's right!",FRY
1563,LEELA,"(whispering) Fry, I have to talk to you. You're in terrible danger.",LEELA
1564,LEELA,"You see Emperor Plon here?  He met his end when he was drunk by Emperor Strug. And before he could even wipe his mouth, Strug was drunk by Shwab.",LEELA
1566,LEELA,Look at all these guys. Do you have any idea what the average length of their reigns was?,LEELA
1569,FRY,Damn! I knew you wouldn't have asked unless it was really high or really low.,FRY
1570,LEELA,Every Emperor ascended to power by assassinating the previous one. And guess who's next?,LEELA
1571,FRY,Well at least my assassin will get what's coming to him.,FRY
1572,LEELA,"You're in tremendous danger, you idiot! Half of these Emperors were drunk at their own coronation.",LEELA
1573,FRY,"Hey, I plan on having a few brewskis myself.",FRY
1574,LEELA,"No, they were assassinated. In fact, the law says you'll be killed on the spot if you fail to recite the oath from memory.",LEELA
1575,FRY,"Yeah, I was going to thumb through that later.",FRY
1576,LEELA,That is completely reckless. Don't you ever think ahead?,LEELA
1577,FRY,"Hell, no. If I stopped to think ahead, I wouldn't be Emperor. And I wouldn't even be here in the year 3000. It's just like the story of the grasshopper and the octopus. All year long the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter while the octopus mooched off his girlfriend and watched TV. But then the winter came and the grasshopper died and the octopus ate all his acorns and also he got a racecar. Is any of this getting through to you?",FRY
1578,LEELA,I give up! You're gonna get yourself killed and this time I won't be here to save you.,LEELA
1579,FRY,Who asked you to? I told you a hundred times to stop treating me like a baby. Now go. Go gather your nuts you nagging grasshopper.,FRY
1580,LEELA,"That's it! I'm never helping you again! If anyone except you needs me, I'll be in the ship.",LEELA
1581,FRY,I'll be fine. It's not like anyone's gonna drink me.  Quit it!,FRY
1585,FRY,"Right! I, Fry, who drank Bont the Viscous, who drank Ungo the Moist, who guzzled Zorn the Stagnant...",FRY
1586,FRY,"...who slurped Hudge the Dewy, who enjoyed a soup composed principally of Throm the Chunky, do solemnly swear to rule with honour and insanity - uh, integrity!",FRY
1588,BENDER,"Hey, look. The suns are setting. I can finally switch to hard liquor!",BENDER
1589,BENDER,"Check out the glowing freaks. It's beautiful! Hey, what's that?",BENDER
1601,FRY,But won't that crush my bones?,FRY
1603,BENDER,"Hey, why don't you just sweat him out?",BENDER
1605,FRY,I could vomit or urinate. Would you feel better about that?,FRY
1608,FRY,That's a great idea! Crying.,FRY
1612,FRY,It's no use. I wanna cry but I'm just too macho.,FRY
1613,BENDER,"I'll make you cry, buddy!  You're a pimple on society's ass and you'll never amount to anything.",BENDER
1614,FRY,What do you mean? I was Emperor of a whole planet.,FRY
1615,BENDER,Good point. But here's a disturbing reminder: Everyone you knew or loved in the 20th century is dead.,BENDER
1617,BENDER,"OK, Fry, grab a Kleenex for this one, 'cause there's no God and your idiotic human ideals are laughable!",BENDER
1618,FRY,Phew! That's a load off my mind.,FRY
1619,BENDER,"Man, I guess it's harder than I thought to make someone cry.",BENDER
1623,BENDER,"Cram it, lobster!  That is a good idea. I'll go call her.",BENDER
1624,FRY,She'll never help me. She's still mad that I told her never to help me.,FRY
1627,BENDER,I'm not giving my name to a machine.,BENDER
1630,BENDER,"...and he needs help. Now, I don't like you and you don't like me.",BENDER
1632,BENDER,You do? Look are you going to help or not?,BENDER
1633,LEELA,I don't know why I should. I mean after what he --,LEELA
1634,BENDER,"Wait, wait, wait, wait.  What is it you like best about me?",BENDER
1636,BENDER,I'm not sure. But I do know that she likes my in-your-face attitude.,BENDER
1640,FRY,This is the saddest day of my life. And I still can't cry.,FRY
1641,BENDER,Wait a second. Here comes Leela.,BENDER
1643,FRY,I can't believe it. She's risking her life for me after the way I treated her. I don't deserve this. I feel terrible.,FRY
1646,BENDER,"I don't know. Perhaps I'll look out this window. Oh, dear God in heaven, they're swarming all over her.",BENDER
1649,BENDER,"They're strapping her to juicer. Oh, they're putting some ice cubes in the glass under it.",BENDER
1650,FRY,This can't be happening.,FRY
1651,BENDER,"It can and, for all you know, it is. I'm sorry, Fry. She's dead.",BENDER
1652,FRY,"All Leela ever wanted to do was help me. But I was to proud, too stupid to accept it.  I wish I had died instead of her.",FRY
1653,LEELA,What are you talking about?,LEELA
1656,BENDER,I told Fry you were dead so he would cry out the Emperor but you had to go and wreck it by surviving.,BENDER
1660,LEELA,"Listen, Fry, I think I can get us out of this if you're willing to let me help you.",LEELA
1661,FRY,"Thanks, Leela. From now on, I'll take all the help you're willing to give. I know you just want what's best for me.  Ow! What was that for?  Hey, come on!  That hurt!",FRY
1662,LEELA,"I know. Amy, get the bottle.",LEELA
1663,FRY,"(crying) Oh, now I understand.",FRY
1664,LEELA,Come on. Everybody help out Fry.,LEELA
1665,FRY,"(crying) Thanks, everybody. I love you all. You guys are true -- ow! Cut it out, Bender! That's a tender area!",FRY
1669,FRY,"Hey, wait a minute! Who are you?",FRY
1675,FARNSWORTH,"Good news, everyone. Tomorrow you'll be making a delivery to Ebola 9, the virus planet.",FARNSWORTH
1677,FARNSWORTH,Because tonight's a special night and I want all of you to be alive. It's the Academy of Inventors annual symposium.,FARNSWORTH
1679,FARNSWORTH,It's the event of the scientific season. Every member presents an invention and the best one wins the Academy prize.,FARNSWORTH
1681,FARNSWORTH,"Oh, my, yes. But not this year, because my latest invention is unbeatable. Behold! The death clock.  Simply jam your finger in the hole and this readout tells you exactly how long you have left to live.",FARNSWORTH
1683,FARNSWORTH,Well it's occasionally off by a few seconds. What with free will and all.,FARNSWORTH
1684,FRY,Sounds like fun. How long do I have left to live?,FRY
1685,BENDER,Ooh! Dibs on his CD player!,BENDER
1688,FARNSWORTH,"That's me at the very first symposium. I'm the Academy's oldest living member, you know. These youngsters all look up to me.",FARNSWORTH
1690,FARNSWORTH,"Why don't you just leave me alone, Wernstrom?!",FARNSWORTH
1692,FARNSWORTH,You young turks think you know everything. I was inventing things when you were barely turning senile.,FARNSWORTH
1695,FARNSWORTH,A hundred years ago he was my most promising student at Mars University. But then after one fateful pop-quiz...,FARNSWORTH
1697,FARNSWORTH,I'm sorry but penmanship counts.,FARNSWORTH
1699,FARNSWORTH,And here it is: Slightly over 99 years later and still no revenge. I'm essentially in the clear.,FARNSWORTH
1700,BENDER,"I've been perusing your fortified wine list and I've selected the '71 Hobo's Delight, the '57 Chateau Par-tay and the '66 Thunder Chevitz.",BENDER
1702,BENDER,And mix them all together in a big jug.,BENDER
1706,FRY,"Don't worry, Professor, it's no competition for your death clock.",FRY
1708,FARNSWORTH,Let's just say it'll put you young whippersnappers in your place!,FARNSWORTH
1710,FARNSWORTH,"Uh, last year, you say?",FARNSWORTH
1712,FARNSWORTH,"Oh, my! Did it put you young whippersnappers in your place?",FARNSWORTH
1714,FARNSWORTH,"Oh, dear, I'll have to invent something new in the next ten minutes. Perhaps some sort of death clock.",FARNSWORTH
1717,FARNSWORTH,"Just a second, just a second.",FARNSWORTH
1719,FARNSWORTH,"Uh, yes, here I am, OK, now, hello there. Now, we all know telescopes allow us to see distant objects. But what if we want to smell distant objects? Well now we can! Thanks to my new invention...the Smellescope.",FARNSWORTH
1721,FARNSWORTH,"The odour travels past this coffee stain here, around the olive pit and into this cigar burn. And this appears to be a, doodle of myself as a cowboy. But the Smellescope is brilliant, I tell you! Think of the astronomical odours you'll smell thanks to me.  Oh, my!",FARNSWORTH
1724,FARNSWORTH,Perhaps 149 is just too old to be a scientist.,FARNSWORTH
1726,FRY,"No, Professor, don't give up. There were plenty of times in my century when I was gonna give up but I never did. Never! Hey, are you even listening to me? Oh, I give up!",FRY
1727,FARNSWORTH,"By God, you're right! I'm going to build that Smellescope!",FARNSWORTH
1729,FRY,Did you build the Smellescope?,FRY
1730,FARNSWORTH,"No, I remembered that I'd built one last year. Go ahead. Try it. You'll find that every heavenly body has its own particular scent. Here, I'll point it at Jupiter.",FARNSWORTH
1731,FRY,Smells like strawberries.,FRY
1732,FARNSWORTH,Exactly! And now Saturn.,FARNSWORTH
1733,FRY,"Pine needles. Oh, man, this is great! Hey, as long as you don't make me smell Uranus.",FRY
1735,FARNSWORTH,"I'm sorry, Fry, but astronomers renamed Uranus in 2620 to end that stupid joke once and for all.",FARNSWORTH
1736,FRY,Oh. What's it called now?,FRY
1737,FARNSWORTH,"Urectum. Here, let me locate it for you.",FARNSWORTH
1738,FRY,"No, no, I think I'll just smell around a bit over here!  Hmm.  Hmm.",FRY
1739,FARNSWORTH,"What is it?  Oh, jeez! Oh, man! Remarkable! A stench so foul is right off the funk-o-meter. I dare say Fry may have discovered the smelliest object in the known universe.",FARNSWORTH
1740,BENDER,"Ooh, ooh, name it after me!",BENDER
1742,FARNSWORTH,"Hmm, perhaps the computer can calculate its trajectory.  My God! Whatever it is it's headed straight for us. With enough force to reduce this entire city to a stinky crater. We have less than 72 hours.",FARNSWORTH
1743,BENDER,"Well, lets get looting!",BENDER
1744,FRY,So this thing's gonna destroy the whole city?  What the heck is it?,FRY
1745,FARNSWORTH,Ah! Just as I thought. The answer lies in this movie I found on the Internet.,FARNSWORTH
1747,FRY,Wow! You got that off the Internet? In my day the Internet was only used to download pornography.,FRY
1748,FARNSWORTH,Actually that's still true.,FARNSWORTH
1751,FARNSWORTH,"So that's the situation. Due to the short-sightedness of Old New York, New New York is going to be destroyed by a giant ball of garbage.",FARNSWORTH
1752,LEELA,"Fry, what the hell were you people thinking back then? How could you just throw your garbage away?",LEELA
1753,FRY,"Hey, hey, gimmie a break! What do you do with it?",FRY
1754,LEELA,We recycle everything. Robots are made from old beer cans.,LEELA
1755,BENDER,Yeah! And this beer can is made outta old robots.,BENDER
1756,LEELA,And that sandwich you're eating is made of old discarded sandwiches.  Nothing just gets thrown away.,LEELA
1757,FRY,The future is disgusting.,FRY
1758,LEELA,Typical 20th century attitude.,LEELA
1759,FRY,"Hey! You have no right to criticise the 20th century. We gave the world the lightbulb, the steamboat and the cotton gin.",FRY
1760,LEELA,Those things are all from the 19th century.,LEELA
1761,FRY,"Yeah, well, they probably just copied us.",FRY
1762,FARNSWORTH,Please! There's no time for this now. This is an emergency. We must warn the mayor.,FARNSWORTH
1764,FARNSWORTH,"Very serious, Mayor Poopenmeyer.",FARNSWORTH
1768,FARNSWORTH,"No, I'm here because a giant trash ball is heading straight for us. Smell for yourself.",FARNSWORTH
1782,LEELA,Can't we just shoot a missile at it?,LEELA
1784,FARNSWORTH,But suppose we send a crew to plant an explosive precisely on the fault line betwen this mass of coffee grounds and this deposit of America Online floppy disks.,FARNSWORTH
1788,FARNSWORTH,"Now, you'll only have one chance to destroy the ball. After that, it will be so close to Earth that blowing it up would cause garbage to rain over the entire planet, killing billions.",FARNSWORTH
1790,FARNSWORTH,"Now here's the bomb I've prepared. Once you activate it, you'll have 25 minutes to get away.",FARNSWORTH
1792,FARNSWORTH,"Now, now, there'll be plenty of time to discuss your objections when and if you return.",FARNSWORTH
1793,LEELA,Odour at magnitude 8.  Magnitude 12. Magnitude 31.  We're breaking up. Turn on the anti-smell device.,LEELA
1796,LEELA,Look at all this filth.,LEELA
1797,FRY,It's not filth. It's a glorious monument to the achievements of the 20th century. Look! A real Beanie Baby.  Oh! A Mr. Spock collector's plate!  Some Bart Simpson dolls!,FRY
1799,BENDER,OK  (à la Homer Simpson) Mmm! Shorts!,BENDER
1800,LEELA,"Fry, this stuff was garbage when it was new. Let's blow it up already!",LEELA
1801,FRY,This junk isn't garbage! I can dig in any random pile and find something great.,FRY
1802,FRY,"(gasping) Alright, let's get to work.",FRY
1803,LEELA,"Let's see. If that's Hypodermic Ridge then the bomb must go right here.  Get ready to run. We've got 25 minutes. Uh, 15 minutes.  5 minutes.  6h minutes?",LEELA
1804,BENDER,There's your problem. The Professor put the counter on upside-down.,BENDER
1805,LEELA,"That idiot! It wasn't set for 25 minutes, it was set for 52 seconds.",LEELA
1806,FRY,We're gonna die! (calmly) Right?,FRY
1809,LEELA,"Hey, watch it! You'll put somebody's eye out!",LEELA
1810,BENDER,"OK, OK, keep your space pants on. I'll take care of this.",BENDER
1812,LEELA,"Yeah, but this garbage ball's unstoppable now. New New York is done for.",LEELA
1815,FARNSWORTH,"Oh, how could I have put that bomb timer on upside-down? I could swear I followed the manual precisely.  I'm a dried up husk of a scientist. This is all my fault.",FARNSWORTH
1816,FRY,"No, it's my fault too. I'm sure I threw out more than my share of that trash up there. Also, one month my toilet broke and it just went straight in the garbage can.  Leela was right. The people of the 20th century were idiotic slobs. Especially me.",FRY
1828,LEELA,That rat! Do something!,LEELA
1831,FARNSWORTH,"Wait! If we could build an object the exact size, density and consistency of the garbage ball, it might just knock the ball away without smashing it to bits.",FARNSWORTH
1832,LEELA,But where can we find a substance the exact density and consistency as garbage?,LEELA
1834,FRY,"Uh, what about garbage?",FRY
1835,FARNSWORTH,Good Lord! A second ball of garbage! That just might work!,FARNSWORTH
1837,FRY,Then it's time to make some more.,FRY
1839,FRY,Stand back and watch the master! This Slurm can.  Now it's garbage. These papers.  Garbage. This picture of your wife.  Pure garbage. Now you try it.,FRY
1841,FRY,"Good!  Don't finish that cruller, throw it away  Bender. Drink that beer and drop the bottle on the ground.  Very nice.",FRY
1843,FRY,People of New New York. Take a lesson from the 20th century. Stop all this pain-in-the-ass recycling and throw your garbage on the floor.,FRY
1844,FRY,Go ahead. Just chuck it any old place like I used to. Your city is counting on you.,FRY
1845,FARNSWORTH,"If my calculations are correct, this garbage ball will knock the other garbage ball directly into the sun.",FARNSWORTH
1848,FARNSWORTH,"Five, four, three, two, three, four, five, six...",FARNSWORTH
1849,LEELA,Just fire the damn thing.,LEELA
1854,FARNSWORTH,"Yes! In your face, Wernstrom!",FARNSWORTH
1857,LEELA,"Should we really be celebrating? I mean, what if the second garbage ball returns to Earth like the first one did?",LEELA
1858,FRY,Who cares? That won't be for hundreds of years.,FRY
1859,FARNSWORTH,Exactly! It's none of our concern.,FARNSWORTH
1860,FRY,That's the 20th century spirit!,FRY
1863,FRY,This is awesome! I've been waiting a thousand years to see a Beastie Boys show.,FRY
1864,BENDER,Can I get anybody a beer?,BENDER
1868,LEELA,Impressive. They're busting mad rhymes with an 80% success rate.,LEELA
1869,BENDER,I believe that qualifies as ill. At least from a technical standpoint.,BENDER
1870,FRY,Will you guys shut up! I'm trying to look cool.,FRY
1873,FRY,Wow! An old-fashioned mosh pit! Come on guys. Tonight we're gonna party like its 1999...again.,FRY
1875,FRY,"Man, these guys rock harder than ever!",FRY
1882,BENDER,"Hey, Fender! Man, I haven't seen you since high school. You still workin' at Jack In The Box?",BENDER
1887,FRY,"Wow! I love you guys! Back in the 20th century, I had all five of your albums.",FRY
1889,FRY,Cool! Can I borrow the new ones? And a couple of blank tapes?,FRY
1891,BENDER,Count me in! I'm gonna drink til I reboot!,BENDER
1892,BENDER,"Hey, what kinda party is this? There's no booze and only one hooker.",BENDER
1894,BENDER,"Uh hey, I'm no square but isn't that counter-indicated by my operations manual?",BENDER
1897,BENDER,"Well, if jacking on'll make strangers think I'm cool, I'll do it!",BENDER
1899,BENDER,"Eh, no need to worry. I don't have an addictive personality.",BENDER
1900,FRY,Hey uh Bender. What are we doing in this bad neighbourhood?,FRY
1901,BENDER,"Shut up, square!  I'll just be a minute!",BENDER
1903,BENDER,Hey! Do I preach to you when you're lying stoned in the gutter? No! So beat it!,BENDER
1905,BENDER,Yo mama! Now shut up and drag me to work!,BENDER
1909,BENDER,"None of your business, get off my back!",BENDER
1911,LEELA,If I didn't know better I'd almost think he was abusing electricity.,LEELA
1912,FRY,Bender? No way!  I definitely would've noticed something.,FRY
1913,LEELA,"Bender, why are you spending so much time in the bathroom? Are you jacking on in there?",LEELA
1915,FARNSWORTH,"Good news, everyone! Today you'll be delivering a crate of subpoenas to Sicily 8, the Mob Planet!",FARNSWORTH
1916,BENDER,"Alright, let's get to work! I'll be out in a second.",BENDER
1917,FRY,I know Big Vinnie said he was giving me the kiss of death but I still think he was gay.,FRY
1919,FRY,"A little.  You OK, Bender?",FRY
1920,BENDER,None of your business! Get off my back!,BENDER
1921,LEELA,Uh oh. There seems to be some sort of electrical disturbance in the Coalsack Nebula.,LEELA
1922,BENDER,A what kind of disturbance?,BENDER
1923,LEELA,Electrical. Anyway it's going to take some careful piloting to avoid it.,LEELA
1924,LEELA,We're out of control. We're heading straight into the electric field!,LEELA
1925,FRY,What's happening? I-I feel weird!,FRY
1926,BENDER,"Come on universe you big, mostly empty wuss! Gimmie all the juice you got! Oh, mama!",BENDER
1928,LEELA,"Bender, we didn't mind your drinking, or your kleptomania, or your pornography ring.",LEELA
1930,LEELA,But this electricity abuse crossed the line. You almost killed us.,LEELA
1931,FRY,And you made me feel like a jerk for trusting you. Just like when my friend Richie swore he wasn't taking drugs and then he sold me my mom's VCR and then later I found out he was taking drugs. You make me ashamed to be your friend.,FRY
1932,BENDER,You're right. I'm a lost cause.,BENDER
1933,BENDER,Maybe there's another way.,BENDER
1934,BENDER,"Oh, yeah, that's the good stuff.  (crying) What am I doing? What have I become? Huh?",BENDER
1943,BENDER,"(singing) Oh, what a beautiful morning, oh what a beautiful day! (talking) Greetings, friends. Don't we all look nice today?",BENDER
1944,FRY,Great he's whacked out on electricity again.,FRY
1945,BENDER,"No, I'm whacked out on life. My friends, I found religion.",BENDER
1946,FRY,Religon? Is this another scam to get free yarmulkes?,FRY
1947,LEELA,"Give him a break, Fry. If this helps Bender clean up his act then I think we should be supportive.",LEELA
1952,BENDER,"Wonderful. Then you'll all come to my exceedingly long, un-air-conditioned baptism ceremony!",BENDER
1959,BENDER,"Uh, while you're at it, could you touch up this seam?",BENDER
1960,LEELA,This is unbelievable. The old Bender never would have taken us out to dinner.,LEELA
1961,BENDER,The old Bender's gone. He won't trouble you anymore.,BENDER
1963,BENDER,"No poison for us, thanks. I'll stick with good old mineral oil.  Ah! Functional!",BENDER
1965,BENDER,Friends! Friends! Surely you're not going to eat before we say Robot Grace? In the name of all that is good and logical we give thanks for the chemical energy we are about to absorb. To quote the prophet Jerimatic: 1000101010101...,BENDER
1967,FRY,Does that mean we can eat now?,FRY
1968,BENDER,"Yes.  But first, since I love you all so much, I'd like to give everyone hugs. Come here, Fry!",BENDER
1969,FRY,"Oh, uh, but I don't want to.",FRY
1970,BENDER,"Mmm! Mmm! Fry, you're my friend!  C'mon, everyone line up for a hug. Let's tear down some emotional walls.",BENDER
1971,LEELA,What are you doing to my ship?,LEELA
1972,BENDER,Sanctifying it!  There! That ought to convert a few tailgaters.,BENDER
1973,FRY,Bender's stupid religion is driving me nuts.,FRY
1975,FARNSWORTH,If only he had joined a mainstream religion like Oprah-ism or Voodoo.,FARNSWORTH
1976,FRY,We've got to get the old Bender back.,FRY
1977,LEELA,"And I think I know a way to do it. We have to reacquaint him with a little thing called ""sleaze"".",LEELA
1978,BENDER,I can't believe somebody hired an interstellar spaceship to deliver a package to Atlantic City. What are we delivering anyway?,BENDER
1980,BENDER,Where are we delivering it to?,BENDER
1982,BENDER,Another job well done. Now back to the office for an enjoyable evening of fasting and repentance.,BENDER
1983,FRY,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, Bender. So long as we're here why don't we take in some, exotic dancing!",FRY
1985,BENDER,"But, those girls don't wear cases. You can see their bare circuits.",BENDER
1986,FRY,"Come on, it'll be fun! Maybe we could even drink a little fortified wine.",FRY
1987,BENDER,"What?"" Drinking wine is a sin. Even if it is deliciously fortified.",BENDER
1988,LEELA,"Hey, Bender, looks at that woman's purse. It's hanging by a spaghetti strand.",LEELA
1990,FRY,And there's Hookerbot 5000. She's got a heart of solid gold!,FRY
1992,BENDER,Stop tempting me! For once in my life I have inner peace.,BENDER
1993,FRY,"Pfft, that's for losers. C'mon, sin your heart out.",FRY
1997,FRY,"Go for it, Bender. You know you wanna!",FRY
1999,BENDER,I'm the greatest.  Woo-hoo!,BENDER
2000,FRY,Look's like we got the old Bender back!,FRY
2001,BENDER,"You know it, pork pie! Except for one thing.",BENDER
2002,BENDER,"Y'know, as a major Hollywood director I'll be holding auditions tonight for my next movie. And even though you're all young and naive, I think you might just have what it takes.  Hey! I'm trying to score here! Can't you read the ""Do Not Disturb"" sign?  No! No!",BENDER
2004,LEELA,What in hell happened to Bender?,LEELA
2005,FRY,"Well he didn't check out. The ashtray's still here.  Look, Nibbler's caught the scent of vodka and motor oil! Go, boy. Follow that stench.",FRY
2006,BENDER,"I'm hallucinating this, right?",BENDER
2008,BENDER,But I don't belong here. I don't like things that are scary and painful.,BENDER
2010,BENDER,"Aww, hell - I mean heck!",BENDER
2012,FRY,Wait! I remember this place. They shut it down after all those people caught salmonella from the flume ride.,FRY
2013,LEELA,Hmm. Look! It's the symbol of Bender's old religion.,LEELA
2014,FRY,"Unbelievable. It's an actual, factual Robot Hell.",FRY
2015,LEELA,Who would've thought hell would really exist? And that it would be in New Jersey!,LEELA
2018,BENDER,"Aw crap, singing. Mind if I smoke?",BENDER
2021,BENDER,(singing) Just tell me why.,BENDER
2023,BENDER,(singing) There must be robots worse than I.,BENDER
2025,BENDER,"(singing) Then please let me explain,",BENDER
2027,BENDER,"(singing) Ah, don't blame me blame my upbringing!",BENDER
2031,FRY,(singing) I don't feel well.,FRY
2032,LEELA,(singing) It's up to us to rescue him.,LEELA
2033,FRY,(singing) Maybe he likes it here in hell.,FRY
2034,LEELA,(singing) It's us who tempted him to sin.,LEELA
2035,FRY,(singing) Maybe he's back at the motel.,FRY
2036,LEELA,"(singing) Come on, Fry, don't be scared,",LEELA
2037,FRY,(singing) My ass has blisters from the slide.,FRY
2039,FRY,"Bender, are you alright?",FRY
2040,BENDER,No! Oh they're tormenting me with up-tempo singing and dancing.,BENDER
2041,LEELA,"Alright, Beelzebot, what'll it take to get our friend back?",LEELA
2043,LEELA,Wait. What fiddle contest?,LEELA
2045,FRY,Wouldn't a solid gold fiddle weigh hundreds of pounds and sound crummy?,FRY
2047,LEELA,(whispering) Do you know how to play the fiddle?,LEELA
2048,FRY,"(whispering) No, do you?",FRY
2049,LEELA,"(whispering) No, but I used to play the drums. They're sorta similar. (talking) What happens if we lose?",LEELA
2055,LEELA,Time for the drum solo!,LEELA
2059,BENDER,I could if you'd drop the stupid gold violin!,BENDER
2061,BENDER,"Don't worry, guys, I'll never be too good or too evil again. From now on, I'll just be me.",BENDER
2062,LEELA,"Uh, do you think you could be just little less evil than that.",LEELA
2063,BENDER,I don't know. Do you think you could survive a 700ft fall?,BENDER
2069,LEELA,That was the worst delivery ever.,LEELA
2070,FRY,Yeah. I'm never going to another planet called Cannibalon!,FRY
2071,BENDER,"Me neither. (upbeat) Food was good, though.",BENDER
2072,FARNSWORTH,"Oh, great news, everyone.",FARNSWORTH
2074,FARNSWORTH,In that case I'll have to hire a new crew to go on our company vacation.,FARNSWORTH
2077,FRY,This is great! I haven't had time off since I was 21 through 24.,FRY
2078,FARNSWORTH,It's just my way of thanking you for not reporting my countless violations of safety and minimum wage laws.,FARNSWORTH
2080,FARNSWORTH,"I've booked us all on the maiden voyage of the largest, most luxurious space cruise ship ever built.  The Titanic!",FARNSWORTH
2082,FRY,"Hey, uh, where's my suitcase?  Ow!",FRY
2084,LEELA,"Oh, God! Not Zapp Brannigan!",LEELA
2086,LEELA,"Let's just say we've ""crossed paths"".",LEELA
2087,BENDER,Was that before or after you slept with him?,BENDER
2090,LEELA,"It's tempting, but, uh, I have a fiancé now. Uh, hmm, uh, hmm, uh, we--, uh ...  Him! Fry, darling, meet Zapp Brannigan.",LEELA
2091,FRY,Huh?  Ooh! How do you do?,FRY
2092,FARNSWORTH,"Ah, here's my stateroom.",FARNSWORTH
2093,BENDER,"Come on, where is it?  Ohh!",BENDER
2094,FARNSWORTH,"Now, Hermes, you and your lovely wife LaBarbara have the suite through there. And Dr. Zoidberg, your marble tank is on the other side.",FARNSWORTH
2095,FRY,"Man, first class seems nice!",FRY
2096,FARNSWORTH,It'll seem even nicer once you've seen your room.,FARNSWORTH
2099,FRY,Well at least we get a window!,FRY
2100,BENDER,"Well, I'm tired of this room and everyone in it. If you'll excuse me, I'm gonna pop over to the casino for the next 135 hours!",BENDER
2102,FRY,I guess that just leaves you and your fake fiancé ... all alone ... on a romatic cruise.,FRY
2103,LEELA,Take it off or I'll break it off.,LEELA
2106,BENDER,"Hmm.  I'm bettin' it all!  Come on, baby needs a new pair of feet!",BENDER
2108,BENDER,No! My cheating unit malfunctioned! You gotta give me a do-over!,BENDER
2110,BENDER,"Gimmie you're biggest, strongest, cheapest drink.",BENDER
2112,BENDER,Allow me to introduce myself. I'm Bender.,BENDER
2114,BENDER,"I assure you, I barely know the meaning of the word ""labour"".",BENDER
2116,BENDER,"Please, call me Bender.",BENDER
2137,LEELA,"Well, our accommodations aren't great but it sure is beautiful our here.",LEELA
2138,FRY,"Yeah, it's pretty romantic-- Uh, I mean platonic. Th-That sure is one platonic view!",FRY
2139,LEELA,"Fry, just be quiet. I'm beginning to think this whole fake fiancé thing was a terrible, terrible--",LEELA
2142,LEELA,"Uh, look, before you get any crazy ideas, that was for Zapp.",LEELA
2143,FRY,"Well, you got anything else for him?",FRY
2144,LEELA,"Alright, can we try not to complicate this?",LEELA
2147,FRY,"See you later, wuvvums!",FRY
2148,LEELA,It would have been nice if you'd told me you were going out with Amy.,LEELA
2149,FRY,"I'm not going out with Amy. It's just to fool her parents. Hey, you're not jealous, are you?",FRY
2150,LEELA,What? No. No! Of course not!,LEELA
2151,FRY,"Good, 'cause I consider my fake relationship with you a lot more meaningful.",FRY
2153,BENDER,I was just about to suggest the same thing.  Pay dirt!,BENDER
2155,BENDER,Yeah. But only 93% as lovely as you.,BENDER
2157,BENDER,"I don't get it, iZac: That bracelet had a diamond the size of a racoon's brain. Why couldn't I steal it?",BENDER
2159,BENDER,"Oh, it's true. But we're star-crossed robots. She, a countess built with a silver spoon in her mouth. And me, just a regular honest Joe.",BENDER
2163,BENDER,"Fellas, please. I'm in love!",BENDER
2181,FARNSWORTH,Though it did get me some action!,FARNSWORTH
2186,LEELA,But I didn't even limbo.,LEELA
2188,BENDER,"Well, now you know. I'm not actually rich. I'm a fraud. A poor, lazy, sexy fraud. This isn't even a real bow-tie -- it's magnetic.",BENDER
2194,FRY,"Well, rest assured, Leela's the only girl for me.",FRY
2199,LEELA,(whispering) What are we gonna do? Fry can't pretend to be both our boyfriends.,LEELA
2200,FRY,(whispering) Sure I can. I learned how to handle delicate social situations from a little show called Three's Company.,FRY
2204,FRY,"Um, let me think. Come and knock on our door, nuh nuh nuh nuh nuh nuh. Uh, Mr Roper--",FRY
2206,FARNSWORTH,"Wait, I'm confused. Now tell me, Fry, which one of these ladies are you involved with?",FARNSWORTH
2213,FRY,"Ah, now there's something we can all enjoy.",FRY
2218,FRY,"Hey, Leela, why'd you run off from dinner?",FRY
2219,LEELA,I didn't run off. I had plenty of time to finish eating and stroll away while you were kissing Amy.,LEELA
2220,FRY,"Oh, look, I'm not actually interested in her if that's what's bothering you.",FRY
2221,LEELA,"Oh, are you sure? I mean, she has two eyes, you have two eyes.",LEELA
2222,FRY,"I know, we seem like a perfect match, but I just don't feel that way about her.",FRY
2225,LEELA,Look's like everybody's got somebody. Except me.,LEELA
2227,LEELA,"What was that?  Oh, my God! We're heading straight into a black hole.",LEELA
2228,FRY,Talk about a mood killer!,FRY
2232,LEELA,OK. We just have to get from here to the escape pods.,LEELA
2233,FARNSWORTH,(shouting) I'm too young to die!,FARNSWORTH
2234,LEELA,"Come on, before its too late!",LEELA
2235,BENDER,"You all go without me. I'm gonna take one last look around. You know, for, uh, stuff to steal.",BENDER
2236,FRY,"You're going back or the Countess, aren't you?",FRY
2237,BENDER,"(whispering) Alright, I am. But I don't want the others to know. If I don't come back, just say I died robbing some old man.",BENDER
2238,FRY,"I'll tell them you went out prying the wedding ring off his cold, dead finger.",FRY
2240,BENDER,(shouting) Countess? Countess?,BENDER
2242,BENDER,"(shouting) Are you hurt, my sweet?",BENDER
2244,BENDER,Just hang on! I'll take care of that fire!,BENDER
2246,BENDER,"And I'd do it again. And perhaps a third time. But that would be it.  When we kiss, I feel like I'm standing waist deep in a pool of cold, rising water.",BENDER
2247,LEELA,Hurry! The escape pods should be just ahead!,LEELA
2249,LEELA,It won't move. And the door release is on the other side.,LEELA
2250,FRY,Then we're dead meat. No one could squeeze under there!,FRY
2262,BENDER,Wait a second. Aren't you a member of the yacht club?,BENDER
2264,FARNSWORTH,Thank God there are plenty of escape pods; We won't have to dress up like women and children.,FARNSWORTH
2265,LEELA,We can't leave yet. We've got to wait for Bender. The high gravity must be slowing down his looting.,LEELA
2273,FRY,Look! It's our nebula. Whenever I see it I'll think back to that moment when we almost--  Never mind!,FRY
2275,LEELA,I don't know. But we can't wait any longer.,LEELA
2277,BENDER,(shouting) Wait for us!,BENDER
2278,LEELA,Something's wrong. We're two metric tons overweight.,LEELA
2282,BENDER,"I can't live without you. If you let go, I let go!",BENDER
2284,BENDER,Don't talk like that. Tragic romances always have a happy ending.,BENDER
2288,LEELA,"But she saved all our lives. Without her, we're light enough to get away.",LEELA
2289,FRY,"Don't cry, Bender. Nobody really knows what happens in a black hole. It's possible she's still alive in another dimension somewhere. Right, Professor?",FRY
2290,FARNSWORTH,"Oh, yes, absolutely!  Not a chance!",FARNSWORTH
2291,BENDER,At least I'll always have her bracelet! What do you think it's worth?,BENDER
2295,FARNSWORTH,"Good news, everyone.  We've got a very special delivery today.",FARNSWORTH
2299,FARNSWORTH,"No, I need it shipped to my office at Mars University.  It's a little experiment that may well win me the Nobel Prize.",FARNSWORTH
2301,FARNSWORTH,"I don't care, they all pay the same.",FARNSWORTH
2303,FARNSWORTH,"Oh, my, no.  Off we go!",FARNSWORTH
2304,FRY,Very impressive. Back in the 20th century we had no idea there was a university on Mars.,FRY
2305,FARNSWORTH,"Well, in those days Mars was just a dreary, uninhabitable wasteland, uh, much like Utah. But unlike Utah, it was eventually made livable, when the university was founded in 2636.",FARNSWORTH
2306,LEELA,"They planted traditional college foliage: ivy, trees, hemp. Soon the whole planet was terraformed.",LEELA
2307,FRY,Does that mean it's safe to breathe the air?,FRY
2309,FARNSWORTH,Over here is Wong Library. It has the largest collection of literature in the Western universe.,FARNSWORTH
2310,BENDER,Hey look. There's a chapter of my old robot fraternity; Epsilon Rho Rho.,BENDER
2312,BENDER,"Of course, I'm a bender. I went to Bending College. I majored in Bending.",BENDER
2316,BENDER,"Uh, no, actually I'm an Epsilon from way back.",BENDER
2318,BENDER,Thanks. Here's your finger back.,BENDER
2319,BENDER,All the coolest robots are in this fraternity.,BENDER
2324,BENDER,You're all losers. My name's Bender.,BENDER
2327,BENDER,"(modest) Yeah, well, a lot of 'em were children. Anyway I should get going.",BENDER
2329,BENDER,"Hmm, OK. But I'll need 10 kegs of beer, a continuous tape of Louie Louie and a regulation two-storey panty-raid ladder.",BENDER
2331,FRY,"I tell you, being here really takes me back to my college days.",FRY
2334,FRY,Good old Coney Island College! Go Whitefish!,FRY
2335,LEELA,"Don't take this the wrong way, Fry, but you don't seem like the educated type.",LEELA
2336,FRY,"Oh, yeah?  Read it and weep. I'm a certified college dropout.",FRY
2337,LEELA,Please! Everyone knows 20th century colleges were basically expensive daycare centres.,LEELA
2338,FARNSWORTH,"That's true. By current academic standards, you're merely a high school dropout.",FARNSWORTH
2339,FRY,"What?! That's not fair. I deserve the same respect any other college dropout gets. By God, I'm gonna enroll here at Mars University and drop out all over again!",FRY
2340,LEELA,You won't last two weeks.,LEELA
2341,FRY,"Aww, thanks for believing in me.",FRY
2343,FRY,"Oh, I don't know.  Hey, Professor, what are you teaching this semester?",FRY
2344,FARNSWORTH,Same thing I teach every semester: The mathematics of quantum neutrino fields. I made up the title so that no student would dare take it.,FARNSWORTH
2345,FRY,Mathematics of wanton burrito meals. I'll be there!,FRY
2346,FARNSWORTH,"Please, Fry, I don't know how to teach; I'm a professor!",FARNSWORTH
2352,BENDER,"Oh, yeah! Someone's been a bad computer! Get a load of that!",BENDER
2357,FRY,"Hey, pretty nice for a single. Two desks, two chairs, a couple of beds.  A woodpecker.",FRY
2358,LEELA,I think that's probably your roommate.,LEELA
2359,FRY,"Oh, right, cool. (shouting) C'mon in, roomie!  (talking) What the--?",FRY
2361,FRY,My roommate's a monkey?,FRY
2363,FARNSWORTH,"Ah, Fry, I see you've met Guenter!",FARNSWORTH
2365,FARNSWORTH,Guenter is my experiment. He was the top secret contents of this stinking crate.,FARNSWORTH
2367,LEELA,So what makes Guenter talk?,LEELA
2368,FRY,Is he genetically engineered?,FRY
2369,FARNSWORTH,"Oh, please! That's preposterous science-fiction mumbo-jumbo. Guenter's intelligence actually lies in his electronium hat which harnesses the power of sunspots to produce cognitive radiation.",FARNSWORTH
2371,FRY,"I understood the word ""hat""!",FRY
2372,FARNSWORTH,"Please, stop bickering. I arranged that you be roommates for a reason: So I'd only have to remember one phone number. Now shake hands and make up.",FARNSWORTH
2376,FRY,This is gonna be a cakewalk!,FRY
2382,FRY,"I'm from the 20th century. Go ahead, ask me anything.",FRY
2384,FRY,Ooh ... I know this ... whatyya call it? Lite Brite!,FRY
2391,BENDER,"Hey, dean, nice looking model.",BENDER
2393,BENDER,"Now, I can explain that.",BENDER
2402,FRY,"So, Chrissy, we seem to be hitting it off. If you're not doing anything later might I escort you to a kegger?",FRY
2406,FARNSWORTH,"And therefore, by process of elimination, the electron must taste like grapeade.",FARNSWORTH
2409,FRY,It's that obnoxious monkey. He kept me up all night with his constant thinking. Just thinking and thinking. He's trying to make me look like an idiot.,FRY
2410,FARNSWORTH,"Don't be jealous. Without his special hat, Guenter might be no more intelligent than you.",FARNSWORTH
2412,FARNSWORTH,"Fry, that monkey is my most important experiment. If you two don't stop fighting I'll have you both neutered.",FARNSWORTH
2419,FARNSWORTH,"Oh, I'm glad you made it, Guenter because in honour of parents weekend I have a special surprise for you.",FARNSWORTH
2421,FRY,Now these monkeys I like!  What's that? You wanna come out?,FRY
2424,FARNSWORTH,What's that they're flinging at us?,FARNSWORTH
2426,FRY,"Hey, uh, Guenter? Why don't you get up on the chandelier with your parents and I'll take a picture?",FRY
2427,BENDER,"Well, looks like the party's winding down. Let's take a road trip to Tijuana and get Fatbot some action.",BENDER
2430,LEELA,"What you did to Guenter was cruel. At the risk of sounding like an after-school special, I think we learned who the real animal was today.",LEELA
2431,FRY,You mean peer pressure?,FRY
2432,FRY,Look out! He's got a gun!,FRY
2434,LEELA,"Hey, what's going on? I thought you didn't like bananas.",LEELA
2436,FRY,"Hey, hey, cheer up. Not everyone turns out like their parents. I mean, look at me. My folks were honest hardworking people.",FRY
2437,LEELA,"Besides, Guenter, you're not like other monkeys. You've got the hat.",LEELA
2439,LEELA,That's so sad. I didn't even know monkeys could cry.,LEELA
2441,FRY,"Look, Guenter, if you're so miserable here, maybe you should just go back to the jungle.",FRY
2443,LEELA,But he's not your father. That guy in the punch bowl was your father.,LEELA
2444,FARNSWORTH,"Look at him, I'm so proud.",FARNSWORTH
2449,FARNSWORTH,"Oh, I always feared he might run off like this. Why? Why? Why didn't I break his legs?",FARNSWORTH
2450,FARNSWORTH,"(crying) Oh, poor Guenter.",FARNSWORTH
2451,LEELA,So he just ran away in the middle of the exam?,LEELA
2452,FARNSWORTH,I'm afraid so. All he handed in was a paper smeared with faeces. He tied with Fry.,FARNSWORTH
2453,FRY,I guess he realised I was right when I told him to go back to the jungle.,FRY
2454,FARNSWORTH,You what? After I spent months slaving over a hot monkey brain?,FARNSWORTH
2455,FRY,"Hey, don't blame me. You tried to force Guenter to be a human but he's an animal. He belongs in the wild. Or in the circus on one of those tiny tricycles. Now that's entertainment.",FRY
2456,FARNSWORTH,"But Guenter's obviously better off being intelligent. Tell him, Leela.",FARNSWORTH
2457,LEELA,"Nuh-uh, I'm staying out of this. Now here's my opinion: What we should do is...",LEELA
2459,LEELA,I said we'll go to the jungle and let Guenter decide once and for all.,LEELA
2468,FRY,"Wow"" The jungles on Mars look just like the jungles on Earth.",FRY
2470,LEELA,I see some movement up there. I think it's him.,LEELA
2473,FARNSWORTH,Don't worry. They'll be fine once the tranquiliser wears off.,FARNSWORTH
2475,LEELA,"Professor, you'll offer Guenter the hat and, Fry, you'll offer him the banana. We'll let him choose whether he wants to be intelligent or just a mindless animal.",LEELA
2476,FARNSWORTH,"Come on, Guenter, take the hat.",FARNSWORTH
2477,FRY,"No, the banana, the banana!",FRY
2478,FARNSWORTH,Consider the philosophical and metaphysical ramifications of the--,FARNSWORTH
2479,FRY,"Banana, banana, banana!",FRY
2480,LEELA,"Wait, what's that sound?",LEELA
2482,BENDER,(shouting) Not as sure as I was an hour ago!,BENDER
2486,FARNSWORTH,"Thank God this log is sturdy.  (shouting) Put on the hat, Guenter! You're the only one who can save us!  (muttering) Stupid monkey.",FARNSWORTH
2491,LEELA,"(shouting) Help us, Guenter!",LEELA
2495,LEELA,"Oh, no! Hurry, Guenter, climb up the vine. You can still save yourself.",LEELA
2497,FARNSWORTH,"Oh, that poor, sweet monkey. Well lets go gather him up. There's no sense letting him go to waste.",FARNSWORTH
2500,FARNSWORTH,"It seems to be working at only half-capacity, but I can fix it.",FARNSWORTH
2502,FARNSWORTH,But what about your super-intelligence?,FARNSWORTH
2505,BENDER,"(shouting) Come on, everyone! Big party in Robot House!",BENDER
2508,FRY,"Pizza delivery! Wow, so this is a real TV station, huh?",FRY
2510,FRY,What are you showing right now?,FRY
2512,FRY,"Ah, I dunno. That's a chick show. I prefer programmes of the genre ""world's blankiest blank"".",FRY
2520,FRY,Pfft! Like anyone on Earth cares.,FRY
2526,FRY,"Ow! Hey, quit it, Hermes. It's Labor Day.",FRY
2530,LEELA,Who's up for one last summer beach trip?,LEELA
2533,FRY,"(unenthusiastic) Eh, I think I'll just stay here.",FRY
2534,LEELA,"Fry, you're wasting your life sitting in front of that TV. You need to get out and see the real world.",LEELA
2535,FRY,But this is HDTV. It's got better resolution than the real world!,FRY
2536,LEELA,Everyone's too polite to say anything but you're covered with bed sores.,LEELA
2539,FARNSWORTH,"Ah, here we are: Monument Beach!",FARNSWORTH
2540,FRY,"Wait, Mount Rushmore and the Leaning Tower of Pisa? I didn't know they were both in New York!",FRY
2541,LEELA,"They are now. In the 2600's New Yorkers elected a super-villain governor, and he stole most of the world's monuments.",LEELA
2542,BENDER,Truly a great man. Look at him up there.,BENDER
2544,BENDER,"OK, now you go hide.  Nice knowin' you.",BENDER
2545,FARNSWORTH,"Come on, Zoidberg, I passed it right to you.",FARNSWORTH
2547,BENDER,"OK, everyone, come and get it!",BENDER
2548,FRY,"Ah, just like my dad used to make ... until McDonald's fired him.",FRY
2549,BENDER,"Bite my red-hot glowing ass.  Wait a minute. Red-hot glowing ass?  (calmly) I'll be right back!  Ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow!  Aw, yeah!",BENDER
2551,FARNSWORTH,"Eh ... wha?  Oh, oh, OK, I think there's one can left.  Oh, my.",FARNSWORTH
2553,FARNSWORTH,Like a cheap French harlot.,FARNSWORTH
2556,LEELA,No. I'm not attracted to bullies. No matter how big and ...  ... handsome they are.,LEELA
2557,FRY,"It's OK, Leela, go ahead. I got a lot of work to do.",FRY
2559,FRY,50 bucks?! Not even if she was my girlfriend. You take her.,FRY
2560,LEELA,Fry! Although I suppose we could go for a walk along the beach.,LEELA
2563,BENDER,"Alright, alright, I'll bust you out. Cheese it!",BENDER
2564,FRY,Voila. The greatest sandcastle ever built. This is the kind of castle King Arthur would have lived in -- If he were a fiddler crab.,FRY
2565,LEELA,It's very nice. We should get a picture before the tide comes in.,LEELA
2566,FRY,"Ooh, yeah. Anyone have a camera?",FRY
2567,BENDER,"Right here, buddy.  Wait, I wanna be in the picture too.  Pretend you're happy.",BENDER
2573,FRY,"We're all gonna die, aren't we?",FRY
2574,FARNSWORTH,"Oh, I should think so. Although last time aliens invaded all they did was force the most intelligent of us to pair off and mate continuously. (chuffed) Oh, yes!",FARNSWORTH
2580,BENDER,"Hey, look, Leela, it's that idiotic windbag you slept with.",BENDER
2581,LEELA,The Earth is under attack. Can't we just forget about that?,LEELA
2584,LEELA,"Well, you heard the windbag: We've been drafted. Everyone into the ship.",LEELA
2585,BENDER,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on. I refuse to fight. I'm a conscientious objector.",BENDER
2589,BENDER,"It is every robot's duty to give his life for the good of humanity.  Oh, crap!",BENDER
2591,BENDER,"Well actually I--  Sir, yes sir! Sir!",BENDER
2595,LEELA,"Thanks, but I'm not technically human.",LEELA
2598,FRY,You mean while I'm sleeping in it?,FRY
2601,FRY,W-Wouldn't it make more sense to send the robots in first a--,FRY
2602,BENDER,"Sir, I volunteer for a suicide mission. Aw, cut it out!",BENDER
2604,LEELA,"Maybe we should wait 'til afterwards, in case neither of us comes back.",LEELA
2606,FRY,"I'm gonna be a science-fiction hero, just like Uhura, or Captain Janeway, or Xena!",FRY
2607,LEELA,"Fry, this isn't TV, it's real life. Can't you tell the difference?",LEELA
2608,FRY,"Sure, I just like TV better.",FRY
2610,BENDER,"The auxiliary power's out, and they spilled my cocktail.",BENDER
2611,FRY,"Alright, scumwads. This one's for Bender's cocktail!",FRY
2613,BENDER,"(sadly) Yeah, but it'll never bring back my martini.  (normal) Well, who wants a martini?",BENDER
2620,LEELA,"This is hopeless.  If we're gonna get blown to bits, we might as well do it in the comfort of our own home.",LEELA
2621,FARNSWORTH,"You'll be the captain, you'll be the delivery boy, and you'll be the alcoholic, foul-mouthed--  Oh, God, you're alive. I mean, thank God you're alive!  Sorry, check back in three days, a week at the most.",FARNSWORTH
2636,FRY,Miniskirts? That sounds familiar.,FRY
2641,LEELA,"You do not, you big fat liar. You don't know anyone. All you do is watch TV.",LEELA
2642,FRY,"That's where I know her from. She's Jenny McNeal. She was a character on a TV show back in the 20th century, Single Female Lawyer.",FRY
2643,BENDER,"Well if they're hoping to see a TV show that hasn't existed for a thousand years, pfft, they are royally boned.",BENDER
2645,FARNSWORTH,(disappointed) I'm beginning to think there'll be no forced mating at all.,FARNSWORTH
2646,LEELA,They're going to destroy the entire Earth if they don't see some stupid TV show about some bimbo lawyer?,LEELA
2647,FRY,It's crazy! How could they even know about a show from a thousand years ago?,FRY
2648,FARNSWORTH,"Well, Omicron Persei 8 is about a thousand light years away. So the electro-magnetic waves would just recently have gotten there. You see--",FARNSWORTH
2652,BENDER,They must just wanna see that episode. Let's find a tape and give it to 'em.,BENDER
2654,FARNSWORTH,"No, there wouldn't be. Most videotapes from that era were damaged in 2443 during the Second Coming of Jesus.",FARNSWORTH
2655,FRY,"Y'know, I saw the first 30 seconds of that episode. If I could make up an ending, maybe we could act it out ourselves.",FRY
2657,FARNSWORTH,I have an old five-megawatt broadcasting tower in the attic.,FARNSWORTH
2658,BENDER,"(dramatically) And I, I could be an acting coach!",BENDER
2660,FRY,"OK, Leela, you'll be starring as Jenny--",FRY
2661,LEELA,"Uh-uh, forget it. A: I'm camera shy, and B: I get tongue tied in front of an audience armed with death rays.",LEELA
2666,FRY,Lights!  Camera one!  Camera two!  Camera three!,FRY
2668,BENDER,(singing) ...And being self-reliant.,BENDER
2669,FARNSWORTH,"Uh, (reading) Jenny McNeal, you are charged with jury-tampering in last week's case ...  ... on account of your hot, naked affair with the foreman. How do you plead?",FARNSWORTH
2670,LEELA,"Your Honour, I move for a mistrial, on the grounds that I'm also having a hot, naked affair with the foreman of this jury.",LEELA
2674,FARNSWORTH,"(reading) Your witness, Prosecutor Ramirez.",FARNSWORTH
2678,LEELA,"Uh, g-- uh, getting back to the, uh, matter, uh-uh, if it please the court ... (whispering) Fry, there's nothing else here. You only wrote two pages of dialogue.",LEELA
2679,FRY,"Well, it took an hour to write. I thought it would take an hour to read.",FRY
2680,LEELA,What are we supposed to do now?,LEELA
2681,FRY,"I don't know, I don't know. Just say anything. As long as it's compelling, mesmerising, a tour de force.",FRY
2683,FARNSWORTH,"(reading) What say you, Single Female Lawyer?",FARNSWORTH
2684,LEELA,"I say ... I'm giving up the law.  And I'm giving up being single. Your Honour, will you marry me?",LEELA
2685,FRY,"No, no! Go to commercial!",FRY
2686,BENDER,We'll be back after this word from Crazy Bender's Discount Stereo.,BENDER
2687,FRY,Married? Jenny can't get married.,FRY
2688,LEELA,"Why not? It's clever, it's unexpected.",LEELA
2689,FRY,"But that's not why people watch TV. Clever things make people feel stupid, and unexpected things make them feel scared.",FRY
2691,FRY,You see? TV audiences don't want anything original. They wanna see the same thing they've seen a thousand times before.,FRY
2692,BENDER,"(à la Arnold Jackson) Whatchoo talkin' 'bout, Fry?",BENDER
2693,FRY,"Trust me on this. While other people were out living their lives, I wasted mine watching TV, because deep down I knew it might one day help me save the world. Plus, I would have lost my Workman's Comp if I hadd gone outside. Now just read these cue cards.",FRY
2695,FARNSWORTH,"(reading) Miss McNeal, I'm afraid I must decline your offer of marriage. For, you see, I'm dying. Cough, then fall over dead.",FARNSWORTH
2697,LEELA,(reading) I will now make my closing statement. With my fiancé deceased ... ... I hereby return to my single female lawyer career. No matter what any man says.,LEELA
2702,BENDER,"(singing) Single Female Lawyer,",BENDER
2704,FRY,"Way to overact ,Zoidberg!",FRY
2707,FRY,"Yep.  It was just a matter of knowing the secret of all TV shows; At the end of the episode, everything's always right back to normal.",FRY
2718,BENDER,Look at that worm go. Who says there are no more heroes?,BENDER
2723,FRY,I like those odds.  Rats. Just another tooth.  Aah!,FRY
2724,FRY,I gotta find that golden bottle-cap.,FRY
2725,LEELA,I've never seen anyone so addicted to Slurm.,LEELA
2726,FRY,This is nothing. Back in high school I used to drink a hundred cans of cola a week. Right up until my third heart attack.,FRY
2729,LEELA,You poor baby. Let me check if you have a fever.  Ow!,LEELA
2730,FARNSWORTH,"According to Bender's temperature gauge, which I suggest you use next time, Leela, he's running a fever of ... 900 degrees.",FARNSWORTH
2733,FRY,"I'm not Bender, I'm Fry.",FRY
2737,BENDER,My tummy hurts and I've been having this burning electrical discharge.,BENDER
2742,FARNSWORTH,Or a big fat placebo. It's all the same crap.,FARNSWORTH
2743,LEELA,"Hey, what's rattling around in there?",LEELA
2744,FARNSWORTH,"It may well be the cause of Bender's illness. But more importantly, it's a flimsy pretext to try out my latest invention. To the laboratory!",FARNSWORTH
2745,FARNSWORTH,"I call this the F-ray. It's like an X-ray only it allows you to see through anything - even metal. Now, the neutrino beam it emits is a tad dangerous, so you'll all need protective goggles. You may feel a slight stinging sensation - all of you-- All of you!  Aha! There's the cause of your illness.",FARNSWORTH
2747,BENDER,"I was wondering where I put that.  Hey, now I feel much better! Thanks, Professor. And, Amy, I'm sorry I took your watch.",BENDER
2748,FARNSWORTH,"Well, I've got to go take this suit to the decontaminators. You two lock up the F-ray and for the love of God don't let it fall into the wrong hands.",FARNSWORTH
2749,BENDER,What should we point it at first?,BENDER
2750,FRY,I 'unno. Try it on me.  Ow! My sperm!,FRY
2751,BENDER,"Wow, neat! Mind if I try that again?",BENDER
2752,FRY,"Huh, didn't hurt that time.",FRY
2753,BENDER,"Whoa, mama! Hold still, sexy lady.",BENDER
2757,BENDER,"Hey, bite my shiny metal ass!",BENDER
2759,FRY,"All this prolonged exposure to radiation is making me thirsty.  Ah, if only there was some way of knowing which can had the winning bottle-cap inside.",FRY
2760,BENDER,"Huh, w-what? I didn't hear you. I was too busy using this F-ray to look inside of things.",BENDER
2761,FRY,"Wait a second. I'm getting an idea. N-No, false alarm. No. Yeah. No. Yeah. No. Wait. No. Yeah. Yeah. No ... no. Yes!",FRY
2763,FRY,"We checked 90,000 cans of Slurm and all we won was this junk.  I never wanna see another can of Slurm again. Man, am I thirsty.",FRY
2765,BENDER,"You did it, Fry! You found the winning bottle-cap! We won!",BENDER
2770,FRY,Uh-huh. Can we have our free Slurm now?,FRY
2773,BENDER,"Wow! The original party worm!  Are you ready to get down, get funky with us?",BENDER
2782,BENDER,Look! Flowers! And a boat!,BENDER
2783,FARNSWORTH,Who are those horrible orange creatures over there?,FARNSWORTH
2787,FRY,"So, what's the secret ingredient?",FRY
2789,FRY,Oh. But what is it really?,FRY
2791,BENDER,"(whispering) Psst, those berries. Those are the secret ingredient, right?",BENDER
2795,BENDER,I'm just asking cause they look kind of secret.,BENDER
2798,LEELA,"Hey, look! The disgusting little men are starting to sing.",LEELA
2811,FRY,"Uh, could I have some Slurm, please?",FRY
2815,FRY,That's not soon enough.,FRY
2816,LEELA,"Hey, what's behind that door?",LEELA
2818,LEELA,Is it the secret ingredient?,LEELA
2820,BENDER,"OK, OK, we get the point.",BENDER
2821,LEELA,I was just curious because of the armed guards.,LEELA
2823,BENDER,(shouting) Shut the hell up!,BENDER
2827,FRY,I'm dying of thirst. Grab my feet and dunk my head in so I can drink.,FRY
2829,FRY,Fine. I'll let go and swim around in the Slurm and drink as much as I want. Help! I can't swim!,FRY
2830,LEELA,"Bender, why did you jump in?",LEELA
2831,BENDER,Everybody was doing it. I just wanted to be popular.,BENDER
2834,BENDER,And why is the Slurm pouring into this sewer?,BENDER
2835,FRY,This isn't Slurm at all!,FRY
2836,LEELA,Something's rotten on the planet Wormulon. Look at this.,LEELA
2837,LEELA,This all must have something to do with the secret ingredient.,LEELA
2838,FRY,My God. What if the secret ingredient ... is people?,FRY
2839,LEELA,No. There's already a soda like that: Soylent Cola.,LEELA
2841,LEELA,It varies from person to person.,LEELA
2848,FRY,"Look! Slurm! Finally!  Oh, yeah! I'm never going 12 minutes without a Slurm again.",FRY
2849,LEELA,It's the end of the line. This must be where they put in the secret ingredient.,LEELA
2850,FRY,"Well, whatever it is, it's even better fresh.  Mmm, still warm.",FRY
2855,FRY,That's the secret ingredient of Slurm?,FRY
2856,LEELA,That's the only ingredient of Slurm.,LEELA
2858,BENDER,"I'll save us!  Oh, that feels good!",BENDER
2861,BENDER,"Uh, your majesty, I brought the prisoners.",BENDER
2863,LEELA,"You wish, you slimy worm! Heyya!",LEELA
2867,LEELA,How can you trick people into drinking something that comes out of your behind? It's disgusting.,LEELA
2869,FRY,Who's behind does that come from?,FRY
2871,BENDER,"Look, we just came to party with Slurms MacKenzie. By the way, when is that scheduled?",BENDER
2874,BENDER,"Ah, this trip is turning into a big letdown.",BENDER
2885,FRY,Here I come.  Let me just-- One more taste.,FRY
2886,LEELA,You pig. Stop stuffing your craw and save us.,LEELA
2887,BENDER,I can't see what's happening. Are we boned?,BENDER
2889,FRY,I can't stop eating this delicious ooze. But I'm not gonna let you die.,FRY
2891,BENDER,What's happening?  Just in time!,BENDER
2892,FRY,(screaming) Nooo!  (talking) I could fit if I didn't have these damn arms!,FRY
2893,LEELA,We're close to the exit. I can smell those filthy orange guys.,LEELA
2899,BENDER,Forget it pal.  It says on this bottle-cap you have to party with us.,BENDER
2905,FRY,But she'll crush you like a worm ... crushing a smaller worm.,FRY
2914,FARNSWORTH,"Commissioner, my crew has made a horrific discovery: It seems that Slurm is produced in a colossal worm hiney!",FARNSWORTH
2916,FRY,"Outlaw Slurm?  Uh, don't pay any attention to him sir ...",FRY
2917,FRY,... Grandpa's making up crazy stories again.,FRY
2918,FARNSWORTH,"I'm not your grandpa, you're my uncle! From the year 2000!",FARNSWORTH
2920,FRY,"Ah, I just wish Slurms MacKenzie were here to enjoy this with me.",FRY
2921,BENDER,"Yeah, that Slurms sure loved to party. Whattya say we all party one last time for him?",BENDER
2924,BENDER,(simultaneously) For Slurms!,BENDER
2925,FARNSWORTH,(simultaneously) For Slurms!,FARNSWORTH
2926,FRY,(simultaneously) For Slurms!,FRY
2928,BENDER,"Hey, that's not that bad.",BENDER
2933,LEELA,Aww! Somebody likes snouts.,LEELA
2935,BENDER,"(shouting) Ow, my head! My precious head!  (talking) Stupid can opener. You killed my father and now you've come back for me!",BENDER
2937,BENDER,"Yeah, I guess so. But I don't see why we keep this ticking time-bomb around just for that dumb animal.",BENDER
2938,LEELA,"Don't yell at Nibbler like that.  You hurt his feelings. Come on, pet him and make up.",LEELA
2941,BENDER,I'll pet him. I'll pet him with both hands!  Ow! My ass! Get off!,BENDER
2943,BENDER,"Ah, it's nothing a lawsuit won't cure.",BENDER
2944,LEELA,"Not you.  Aww, poor baby chipped a fang.",LEELA
2945,BENDER,"Hey, I got a busted ass here, I don't see anyone kissing it.",BENDER
2949,BENDER,"What's that you say there, doctor? You're gonna have to put him down?",BENDER
2951,BENDER,Terrible shame that. Shall I do the honours?,BENDER
2954,LEELA,Next time I'm keeping it.,LEELA
2956,FRY,"Hey, what are these rings in Nibbler's fang?",FRY
2958,FRY,"Yeah, well, good luck. It'd take some kind of genius to count all those rings.",FRY
2960,FARNSWORTH,"Happy birthday, young Nibbler.",FARNSWORTH
2961,LEELA,"Aww, look how cuddly he looks in his new cape!",LEELA
2962,BENDER,(sarcastic) I'd be cuddly too if someone gave me a new cape.,BENDER
2963,FRY,Who's playing pin the tail on the moon maggot?,FRY
2964,BENDER,"Ooh, me! Everyone watch how good I am. And the crowd goes wild! What prize do I get? Cash?",BENDER
2968,BENDER,You call that talent? Gather round old Bender and get ready for the show of a lifetime.  Ta-da!,BENDER
2970,LEELA,"Come on, let's all sing Happy Birthday!",LEELA
2972,FRY,(singing) ... and you smell like one too!,FRY
2974,LEELA,"Bender, I thought you were supposed to be cooking for this party.",LEELA
2975,BENDER,"Fine, we'll have rack of Nibbler.",BENDER
2976,LEELA,"Just make a simple cake. And this time, if someone's going to jump out of it, make sure you put them in after you cook it.",LEELA
2977,BENDER,"So it's a cake you want, is it? I'll make you a cake you'll never forget.",BENDER
2978,BENDER,"That'll take care of those annoying rats.  Now, to bake a cake so delicious they'll have no choice but to love and worship me.",BENDER
2979,BENDER,There! This'll teach those filthy bastards who's lovable. Now all I have to do is spell check it and it's ready for my admiring public.  No! Get away from there!  That's it.,BENDER
2981,LEELA,"Bender, what's going--  (crying) No!",LEELA
2982,BENDER,Hey! Can't you see I'm using the toilet?,BENDER
2984,BENDER,"Well, step one, I had to lift the seat. That was the first little annoyance. Am I right, men?",BENDER
2985,LEELA,(crying) Aren't you upset at all? How would you feel if I flushed Fry down the toilet?,LEELA
2986,BENDER,Only one way to find out.,BENDER
2987,LEELA,(crying) You have no sympathy for anyone else's feelings.,LEELA
2988,BENDER,Of course I do. Right now I feel sorry for you.,BENDER
2990,BENDER,"Yeah. I mean, one cantaloupe-sized bloodshot eye? You ain't winning no beauty pageants, lady.",BENDER
2991,FARNSWORTH,"And so we say goodbye to our beloved pet Nibbler, who's gone to a place where I too hope one day to go: The toilet.",FARNSWORTH
2992,LEELA,(crying) I wouldn't feel so bad if Bender just understood the pain he caused me.,LEELA
2995,BENDER,"Bet you weren't expecting that one, Calculon!",BENDER
2997,LEELA,I wish just once Bender could feel exactly what I feel.,LEELA
2998,FARNSWORTH,"Actually, through the miracle of science, that can be arranged.",FARNSWORTH
2999,FRY,Uh-oh. Is this gonna be another crazy experiment that crosses a line Man was not meant to cross?,FRY
3001,BENDER,"Hey, what the hell are you doing with my head?",BENDER
3002,FARNSWORTH,I need to tinker in it.,FARNSWORTH
3003,BENDER,Why don't you just use a potted plant like Fry?,BENDER
3004,FARNSWORTH,"Quiet, you. I'm installing an empathy chip.",FARNSWORTH
3005,FRY,And that'll allow Bender to feel other people's emotions?,FRY
3006,FARNSWORTH,"Yes. If by ""allow"" you mean ""force"".",FARNSWORTH
3007,BENDER,Ooh! Ow! Son of a-- Careful with that! Ow ...,BENDER
3008,FARNSWORTH,"Oh dear, oh my. I got it. Once more.",FARNSWORTH
3012,FARNSWORTH,There we go.  Now I'll simply tune it to Leela's emotional frequency.,FARNSWORTH
3013,BENDER,"My God, I'm overcome with ... feelings. I'm experiencing a powerful yearning to ... to cram my gullet full of mackerel heads.",BENDER
3016,BENDER,"Now I'm worried that I'm not as smart as Leela, but at the same time I feel relieved that I'm cuter than her.",BENDER
3018,FRY,(whispering) Thanks for covering.,FRY
3019,BENDER,This time I miss Nibbler and I'm feeling nosy and opinionated.,BENDER
3022,LEELA,"Thank you, Professor. I'm happy that Bender can finally feel my pain.",LEELA
3023,BENDER,Happy. I like this feeling. Just don't revert to your usual mopey self.,BENDER
3024,LEELA,I'm not mopey. You shut up!,LEELA
3025,BENDER,"Anger, huh? How dare you make me feel anger, you one-eyed jerk with a dead pet!",BENDER
3026,LEELA,"Thanks for taking me out, Amy. I feel slightly less miserable already.",LEELA
3028,LEELA,A puppy? Nibbler loved to eat puppies.,LEELA
3030,BENDER,(crying) I miss Nibbler.,BENDER
3032,BENDER,"Hell, no! It's Leela's stupid feelings. Why can't she just drink herself happy like a normal person?",BENDER
3033,BENDER,"Uh-oh, jealousy.  (shouting) You think you're so hot!",BENDER
3035,BENDER,The only reason you get all the guys is because you dress like a tramp!,BENDER
3036,FRY,(crying) They're just responding to my personality.,FRY
3038,LEELA,(theatrical happiness) Sure. I'm having a great time -- really. You two go enjoy yourselves.,LEELA
3039,BENDER,(crying) I'm so lonely. I'm gonna go eat a bucket of ice cream.  (crying) A bucket of ...,BENDER
3040,FRY,(shouting) The spoon's in the foot powder.,FRY
3041,BENDER,"I'm at the end of my rope. I can't live another minute without poor, sweet Nibbler.",BENDER
3042,FRY,"Too bad he wasn't an alligator. Y'know, when you flush those things they stay alive in the sewers.",FRY
3044,FRY,Yep. My friend's cousin's caseworker saw one once. It's a widely-believed fact.,FRY
3045,BENDER,"Hmm, sewers.  Thinking, thinking, thinking.",BENDER
3046,BENDER,"Hang on, Nibbler. Uncle Bender's coming to save you.  Damn, it's too small. What did those human design this for anyway?  Aha! Bender, one; toilet, zero! See you on the other side!",BENDER
3048,FRY,Have you seen my sombrero?,FRY
3049,LEELA,Now he's flushed himself down the toilet? Who's he gonna flush next?,LEELA
3050,FRY,"Hey, it's your fault. He only flushed himself because your emotions made him feel bad.",FRY
3051,LEELA,You're right. I feel terrible.,LEELA
3052,FRY,"Oh, great, now you're making him feel worse!",FRY
3053,LEELA,I guess we'd better go down into the sewers and look for him.,LEELA
3056,LEELA,There's no such thing as mutants. That's a ridiculous urban myth.,LEELA
3057,FARNSWORTH,"Oh, don't be so sure. Many scientists believe humans really could mutate down there. Uh, due to exposure to toxic waste and radioactive runoff and good old American faeces.",FARNSWORTH
3059,FRY,"Phew! Uh, ladies first.",FRY
3060,FRY,"Oh, and the aftertaste!",FRY
3063,LEELA,"OK, check the guidebook.",LEELA
3064,FRY,"Looks like we're under Park Avenue. Ooh, ritzy! Just think: All this was probably once a charity luncheon for the Met.",FRY
3066,BENDER,I never should have thrown out the manual.,BENDER
3067,LEELA,"Bender, you didn't have to come down here.",LEELA
3068,BENDER,I know. But I just missed Nibbler so much.,BENDER
3069,LEELA,(crying) He was so cute.,LEELA
3070,BENDER,(crying) He was so sweet.,BENDER
3071,FRY,Eck! This emotional display is making me nauseous.  Or maybe it's whatever that is.,FRY
3074,LEELA,"It's no use. We'd better turn back. Which way, Fry?",LEELA
3075,FRY,"Hmm. According to this map, the only way out is through ... that pipe.  Don't worry. It gets wider after about a mile.",FRY
3076,LEELA,(simultaneously) Idiot.,LEELA
3077,BENDER,(simultaneously) Idiot.,BENDER
3078,FRY,"OK, OK, nevermind. I'll just ask those people for directions.",FRY
3081,FRY,I'll take care of this!  Back! Back!,FRY
3087,FRY,"Hey, aren't you supposed to be eating our brains? You're mutants.",FRY
3091,BENDER,"You guys realise you live in a sewer, right?",BENDER
3094,FRY,Daylight and everything.,FRY
3097,LEELA,"Listen. We actually came down here to find our pet, Nibbler. He got flushed down the toilet.",LEELA
3099,BENDER,Nothing but crumpled porno and Ayn Rand.,BENDER
3101,FRY,Wow. You guys worship an unexploded nuclear bomb?,FRY
3104,BENDER,"(shouting) Come to Daddy, sweetie-ookums.",BENDER
3105,FRY,"So, is it true that alligators flushed down the toilet survive down here?",FRY
3113,LEELA,El Chupanibre? What's that?,LEELA
3117,LEELA,Wait. Our pet Nibbler loves fresh crocodile. It's his favourite treat. He must be El Chupanibre.,LEELA
3120,LEELA,You don't understand. He would never hurt people. Let us help you capture him.,LEELA
3125,BENDER,"Oh, I made myself feel bad.",BENDER
3128,LEELA,Nightfall? How can you tell down here?,LEELA
3131,BENDER,"Nibbler! Aw, come here precious!  Look everyone, it's El Chupanibre.",BENDER
3135,FRY,I'll take care of this.,FRY
3138,FRY,"Leela, your scaredness is being transmitted straight to Bender. If you care about Nibbler, stop caring about him!",FRY
3139,LEELA,I can't. I love every living creature.,LEELA
3143,BENDER,"Listen to me, Leela: I'm an expert at not caring. The secret is to stop giving a rat's ass about anyone else and start thinking of the things that you want, that you deserve, that the world owes you.",BENDER
3144,LEELA,"Well, I could use a new tank top.",LEELA
3146,LEELA,A fashionable tank top. And designer boots ... encrusted with jewels.,LEELA
3147,BENDER,"Don't stop now, you'll need some pants to go with that outfit.",BENDER
3148,LEELA,Yeah. And I could afford it all if I didn't have to feed that stupid Nibbler.,LEELA
3149,BENDER,"Bender is back. I'll save you, Nibbler.",BENDER
3150,FRY,Bender's gonna be killed!,FRY
3151,LEELA,You know what else I could use? A weekend at one of those fancy spas. And a Toblerone.,LEELA
3157,FARNSWORTH,That was a disgusting story.,FARNSWORTH
3158,LEELA,"And it's all thanks to Bender. I love you, Bender.",LEELA
3159,BENDER,I love you too.  Get that stupid chip out of me before I kill myself!,BENDER
3160,FARNSWORTH,"Bender, you won't believe this, but the empathy chip burned out. The emotion you felt for Nibbler was actually your own.",FARNSWORTH
3161,FRY,Looks like Bender learned an important lesson about respecting other people's feelings afterall.,FRY
3162,FARNSWORTH,"No, I'm wrong. The empathy chip was running at triple capacity.",FARNSWORTH
3163,BENDER,"And I still barely felt anything. Goodnight, losers!",BENDER
3164,LEELA,"You know, Bender may not have learned anything from me, but I think I actually learned something from him.  (shouting) So long, jerkwads!",LEELA
3168,FRY,Hmm. Horsey to pointy guy six.  Check.,FRY
3171,FARNSWORTH,"Good news, everyone.  We have a mission to further the noble cause of intergalactic peace.",FARNSWORTH
3172,BENDER,Nope. Watching cartoons.,BENDER
3175,FARNSWORTH,It's a delivery for the Democratic Order Of Planets.,FARNSWORTH
3177,FARNSWORTH,"It's similar to the United Nations from your time, Fry.",FARNSWORTH
3181,FARNSWORTH,Tonight is the ribbon-cutting for the DOOP's new headquarters.,FARNSWORTH
3182,LEELA,What are we delivering?,LEELA
3183,FARNSWORTH,Something without which no ribbon-cutting ceremony could proceed. The ceremonial oversized scissors.,FARNSWORTH
3184,LEELA,We'll get them there as quickly as we can.,LEELA
3185,FARNSWORTH,"Alright, but don't run with them.",FARNSWORTH
3186,FRY,"Wow! There's a million aliens. I've never seen anything so mind blowing. Ooh, a reception table with muffins!",FRY
3188,FRY,"So, what's it like on planet Amazonia?",FRY
3190,FRY,That's so interesting. Maybe we could get to know each other over a coffee.,FRY
3194,BENDER,(whispering) He means you guys did it.,BENDER
3195,LEELA,"If you don't mind, we're here to deliver the scissors for the ribbon-cutting.",LEELA
3199,LEELA,But they're not even sharp. Who could I possibly hurt with them?,LEELA
3227,LEELA,"Dismiss all charges? Your Honour, I know the case is closed and you've rendered your verdict, but I wanna testify.",LEELA
3230,LEELA,"That's a stupid question. What matters is Zapp Brannigan is the sorriest captain I've ever seen, and I saw the idiot blow up DOOP headquarters with my own eye.",LEELA
3251,LEELA,"Alright, this is the third hose fight I've broken up today and the second one using actual hoses. Now move your lazy asses and start scrubbing the ship like I ordered you to.",LEELA
3252,FRY,"You don't have to get so mad, Leela.",FRY
3253,BENDER,"Yeah, Fry already wiped off some of the dirt with his finger.",BENDER
3260,LEELA,You don't know how to do any of those things.,LEELA
3262,FARNSWORTH,"Leela, who are you talking to?",FARNSWORTH
3264,FARNSWORTH,"Why, you're that disgraced starship captain.  Having him on staff will distract people from our horrendous safety record. Come in.",FARNSWORTH
3265,FARNSWORTH,I'd like everyone to meet our new employees. (whispering) Which ones are new?,FARNSWORTH
3267,FARNSWORTH,"Hmm, I could swear I've never seen that robot before either.",FARNSWORTH
3268,BENDER,I'm Bender. You know? The lovable rascal.,BENDER
3269,FARNSWORTH,"Oh, yes, yes. My good friend, of course. Anyway, whoever you all are, I have good news. You'll be making a delivery to Stumbos 4, a planet with such high gravity you'll most likely be crushed under the weight of your own hair. Enjoy.",FARNSWORTH
3274,FRY,"No, she just makes us do work and stuff.",FRY
3276,BENDER,"Hey, this guy's alright!",BENDER
3279,LEELA,"Thanks, Kif. Very nice work.",LEELA
3281,LEELA,"I said ""very nice work"".",LEELA
3283,LEELA,"OK, crew, listen up. Your job is to delivery these 40 pillows to that hotel.",LEELA
3284,BENDER,They're not very heavy but you don't hear me not complaining.,BENDER
3285,LEELA,They're not heavy in here because we have an anti-grav pump. But once you get out on the surface the gravity will be very intense.,LEELA
3286,FRY,"Hey, no prob', this lead apron'll protect me.",FRY
3287,LEELA,I don't want any screw-ups. Use the hover-dolly and just deliver one pillow at a time.,LEELA
3288,BENDER,"Hey, here's an idea, let's deliver all the pillows at once.",BENDER
3293,LEELA,What the hell happened?,LEELA
3294,BENDER,"Some breaking occured, the dolly was involved, that's about all we know.",BENDER
3295,LEELA,I told you dumb apes not to overload it. Each of those pillows weighs 150lbs here.,LEELA
3296,FRY,"Alright, don't get your panties in a knot. We'll just use the back-up dolly.",FRY
3297,BENDER,I'll start loading up the pillows.,BENDER
3298,LEELA,"No way, Jack. You disobeyed an order, so now you have to deliver all 40 pillows by hand.",LEELA
3301,BENDER,"(mocking) I'm Leela, get to work, neh neh neh.",BENDER
3304,LEELA,"Y'know, why don't we talk about something besides Zapp for a while?",LEELA
3306,FRY,"Ah, some good old high-gravity rain. That'll cool us off.",FRY
3307,BENDER,This is all Leela's fault.,BENDER
3308,FRY,"Yeah. If she had let us use the back-up dolly, we could have broken it, given up and gone home by now.",FRY
3310,FRY,"Ah, Leela's not that bad. I just wish she didn't make us work so much.",FRY
3316,BENDER,"You're outta here, lady. Zapp's the new captain.",BENDER
3317,FRY,All hail the new captain.,FRY
3319,LEELA,"On what grounds, you slobbering oaf?",LEELA
3323,LEELA,You really don't want me to be captain anymore?,LEELA
3325,LEELA,"But, didn't I do a good job?",LEELA
3326,FRY,You were mean and you yelled and you made us do all that work.,FRY
3327,LEELA,"Sometimes a captain needs to do those things. Besides I, I thought we were friends.",LEELA
3328,FRY,"Yeah, well, you shouldn't have been such a mean captain then.",FRY
3329,BENDER,"Don't worry, Leela, soon we'll be able to look back on this and laugh.",BENDER
3333,BENDER,To the ends of the universe.,BENDER
3346,FRY,"This is awesome! We're gonna be like pow-pow-pow, and they're gonna be like ...  ... and then we'll have pancakes to celebrate and I'll be like...",FRY
3348,BENDER,"Yes sir, sirdy-sir-sir-sir!",BENDER
3356,FRY,Wait a second. Is this plan gonna kill us?,FRY
3358,FRY,"Leela, we want you to be captain again.",FRY
3359,LEELA,Let me guess. He cancelled naptime? He ran out of beer?  So he's about to kill us?,LEELA
3360,FRY,We want Leela to be captain again.,FRY
3363,LEELA,"Oh, no! He's disabled the steering. We're gonna crash!",LEELA
3364,BENDER,"Leela save me ... and yourself, I guess ... and my banjo.  And Fry.",BENDER
3365,LEELA,"OK, OK. We have one chance. Are you willing to do what I say as captain?",LEELA
3367,LEELA,Even if I make you work hard?,LEELA
3368,BENDER,As your God is my witness.,BENDER
3369,LEELA,Then go get the hover-dolly you didn't break and load all the dark matter into the left engine.,LEELA
3370,BENDER,"Oh, man, that crap's heavy.",BENDER
3374,LEELA,Hurry! I don't wanna die at the age of 25.,LEELA
3375,BENDER,"Honey, unless we hit a time warp, I wouldn't worry about it.",BENDER
3378,LEELA,You did it! You actually did it!,LEELA
3379,FRY,And no one will have to punish anyone for the mutiny.,FRY
3383,FARNSWORTH,(whispering) That a girl! If they don't take him back we can keep him as captain.,FARNSWORTH
3384,LEELA,"Your Honour, it's all true: My female incompetence, Zapp's cat-like reflexes, the stuff that made no sense, all of it.",LEELA
3389,FRY,"Leela, I just want you to know that even though you're mean, you're the best captain ever.",FRY
3390,BENDER,"Yeah, you're one dynamite lady. Can we have a week off?",BENDER
3402,BENDER,Cursed by his own hubris!,BENDER
3403,LEELA,"There's a political debate on! Quick, change the channel!",LEELA
3404,BENDER,"Hey, that's what Fry said when we turned on the debate!",BENDER
3406,LEELA,"Look, I know there are no car chases but this is important. One of these two men will become president of the world.",LEELA
3407,FRY,What do we care? We live in the United States.,FRY
3408,LEELA,The United States is part of the world.,LEELA
3409,FRY,Wow! I have been gone a long time.,FRY
3412,FRY,These are the candidates? They sound like clones.  Wait a minute. They are clones!,FRY
3413,LEELA,Don't let their identical DNA fool you. They differ on some key issues.,LEELA
3416,FRY,"If I were registered to vote, I send these clowns a message by staying home on election day and dressing up like a clown.",FRY
3418,FRY,Nope. Not vaccinated either! Besides. It's not like one vote ever made a difference.,FRY
3419,LEELA,That's not true. The first robot president won by exactly one vote.,LEELA
3420,BENDER,"Ah, yes. John Quincy Adding Machine. He struck a cord with the voters when he pledged not to go on a killing spree.",BENDER
3421,FARNSWORTH,"But, like most politicians, he promised more than he could deliver.",FARNSWORTH
3422,LEELA,"The point is, one vote can make a difference and even though it won't, I'm still taking you to get registered.",LEELA
3423,FARNSWORTH,"Yes, that's a capital idea. Let's all go register.",FARNSWORTH
3424,FRY,"Professor, when did you become so obsessed with voting?",FRY
3425,FARNSWORTH,The very instant I became old.,FARNSWORTH
3426,FARNSWORTH,The problem with both parties is that they always want to give your tax dollars to the less fortunate.,FARNSWORTH
3427,FRY,The less fortunate get all the breaks!,FRY
3431,FRY,"What party do you belong to, Bender?",FRY
3432,BENDER,I'm not allowed to vote.,BENDER
3436,FRY,"OK, but what are the Brain Slugs who control you gonna do for the working man?",FRY
3438,FRY,"(sarcastic) Sure, you say that now!",FRY
3443,FARNSWORTH,So what are you doing to protect my constitutional right to bear doomsday devices?,FARNSWORTH
3445,FARNSWORTH,"Damn straight! Today, the mad scientist can't get a doomsday device, tomorrow it's the mad grad student. Where will it end?",FARNSWORTH
3449,FRY,Now here's a party I can get excited about. Sign me up!,FRY
3451,FRY,"(downbeat) OK then, screw it.",FRY
3455,FRY,That was pretty cool. I think I'm actually starting to get interested in politics.,FRY
3464,LEELA,What are you talking about?,LEELA
3465,BENDER,My body's 40% titanium!  I'm finally richer than those snooty ATM machines.,BENDER
3466,FRY,Too bad you can't spend it.,FRY
3471,BENDER,"Game's over, losers. I have all the money! Compare your lives to mine and then kill yourselves!  Hey, get away. Shoo! I'll give you five dollars to not do what you're thinking about doing. You just lost five dollars!",BENDER
3472,BENDER,"Hey, buddy. Little help?  (shouting) Thank you!",BENDER
3474,LEELA,Bender? What happened to you?,LEELA
3475,FRY,"Yeah, you look different. Did you get a haircut?",FRY
3477,FARNSWORTH,"Sold your body? Oh, Bender, I've been down that road. I know it's glamorous and the parties are great but you'll end up spending every dollar you make on jewellery and skintight pants.",FARNSWORTH
3478,FRY,"This is crazy, Bender. How are you gonna live without a body?",FRY
3479,BENDER,Pft. Bodies are for hookers and fat people! All I need is a wad of cash with a head wrapped around it.,BENDER
3480,FRY,"Well, at least now you can pay off your loan shark.",FRY
3481,BENDER,"Yeah, right. What's he gonna do, break my legs?",BENDER
3482,BENDER,"Ah, this is the life. Another martini, please.",BENDER
3483,BENDER,"Shaken, not stirred.  Aw, yeah!",BENDER
3486,BENDER,Yes! The rich get richer!,BENDER
3487,BENDER,"Strike! In your face, Leela!  Ow!",BENDER
3489,FRY,"Hey, Bender, can I take a ride in your car?",FRY
3490,BENDER,"Maybe if you clean up first. It looks like your neck stepped in something. Oh, I'm sorry, that's just your body!",BENDER
3491,FRY,Hey! You look me in the shins and say that.,FRY
3492,BENDER,"I've had it up to here with this place. I'm off to the Head Museum to hang out with classy heads like me who appreciate the finer things: poetry, philosophy, hats. So long, coffin stuffers.  Uh, could one of you coffin stuffers please carry me?",BENDER
3493,BENDER,"Now, which group of heads is good enough for me to hang out with? What do you think, Fry? Fry?",BENDER
3495,FRY,I recognise you. Didn't you used to have a body of some sort?,FRY
3497,FRY,"Well, you're looking great.",FRY
3500,BENDER,"Ah, US presidents.  Sturdy shelves, good security.  This place has class.",BENDER
3503,FRY,"(to Clinton) Hey, I remember you. I was gonna vote for you one time. But voting isn't cool so I stayed home alone and got trashed on Listerine.",FRY
3506,BENDER,"So then the hookerbot says, ""That's not my expansion slot"" and my friends says, ""That's not my gold-plated 25-pin connector!""",BENDER
3508,BENDER,"You know, I like it here. What's the rent on one of these jars?",BENDER
3516,BENDER,Same reason you hocked your teeth.,BENDER
3519,FRY,"I hear that. I spent most of my teen years loving my body. Course, it was tough love but -- ooh!",FRY
3520,LEELA,"Fry, he opened up relations with China. He doesn't want to hear about your ding-dong.",LEELA
3521,BENDER,"So, Nixon. Even if you miss your body, being a head's great too, right?",BENDER
3523,BENDER,"Oh, great. Now you tell me!",BENDER
3525,BENDER,"(sleep-talking) Ones...zeros...one, one, zero, zero, one --",BENDER
3527,BENDER,"Whoa, what an awful dream. Ones and zeros everywhere. And I thought I saw a two.",BENDER
3528,FRY,"It was just a dream, Bender. There's no such thing as two.",FRY
3529,BENDER,"I know what this is about. My body loved me, and I turned its back on it. Well, old friend, tie a yellow ribbon round your neck, 'cause I'm a-comin' home!",BENDER
3530,BENDER,You sold my body? To who?!,BENDER
3532,FRY,"Hey, my clothes are worth 50 bucks!",FRY
3534,BENDER,(crying) Oh! How could I let this happen? I can't go through the rest of my life like this.,BENDER
3535,FARNSWORTH,Don't you have a self-destruct button?,FARNSWORTH
3536,BENDER,"(crying) Yeah, but it's on my body. What am I gonna do?",BENDER
3537,FRY,"Ah, I can't stand to see a robot cry. Let's watch TV!",FRY
3543,LEELA,"Bender, he's got your body!",LEELA
3544,BENDER,"That dirty, double-crossing bastard! How dare he run off with Richard Nixon!",BENDER
3545,LEELA,Nixon must have bought your body from the pawn shop.,LEELA
3546,FRY,"Yeah, and that electric guitar.",FRY
3548,BENDER,"Yeah you are, you stole my body! Fry, Leela, you gotta help me!",BENDER
3549,LEELA,"Ordinarily I'd say no and lecture you on how this is your own fault for being such an idiot. But when a robotic Nixon is on the loose, we have a duty to take action. Idiot.",LEELA
3554,BENDER,"Great. First he steals my body, now he's touching my stuff.",BENDER
3555,LEELA,Come on. We've gotta find some way to talk to him.,LEELA
3565,BENDER,Give me my body back you two-bit thief!,BENDER
3567,FRY,"Please, Mr. Nixon. We're appealing to your sense of decency.",FRY
3570,BENDER,(crying) It's hopeless. We might as well turn in my head for the five cent deposit.,BENDER
3571,FRY,"No way! I'm not letting my best friend get recycled. Not for five cents, not for five hundred cents! Leela, I've got a plan!",FRY
3572,LEELA,I've got a better plan.,LEELA
3573,FRY,(whispering) Why would Nixon stay at the Watergate?,FRY
3574,LEELA,(whispering) They give you a discount if you've been here before.,LEELA
3575,FRY,"Keep going, we're right behind you.",FRY
3576,BENDER,"Whoa, mama! Get a room, you two!",BENDER
3578,BENDER,Well then lose some weight.,BENDER
3581,BENDER,(whispering) Psst! There I am!,BENDER
3583,LEELA,"OK, almost got it. Steady. Steady. Don't panic.",LEELA
3586,BENDER,I'm just here for what's mine. Don't make me kick your neck.,BENDER
3588,LEELA,"Alright, break it up, you two!",LEELA
3590,LEELA,You'll never pardon anybody because you'll never get elected president. The voters of Earth aren't the pea-brained idiots they were back in your time.,LEELA
3594,BENDER,"Not so fast, Nixon! Are you familiar with audio tape?",BENDER
3598,LEELA,"The jig's up, Nixon. We'll trade you the tape for the body.",LEELA
3600,FRY,"Hey, I've got one last thought.",FRY
3601,BENDER,"Ah, it's good to be back in one piece again. Except I can't get these damn bumper stickers off.",BENDER
3609,FRY,Why would robots vote for Nixon now that he's just a head in a jar?,FRY
3612,FARNSWORTH,I can't believe it. He won by a single vote.,FARNSWORTH
3613,BENDER,"Well it ain't my fault. I'm a non-voting felon, thank you.",BENDER
3614,FRY,Well it's not my fault either 'cause I forgot to vote.,FRY
3615,LEELA,"Oh, crud. I knew there was something I meant to do today.",LEELA
3623,BENDER,No. they fixed that 900 years ago.,BENDER
3629,BENDER,"Ah, lets face it: Comedy's a dead art form. Now tragedy ...  ... That's funny!",BENDER
3630,FARNSWORTH,"Come on, everyone. Perhaps some skiing will help us forget the mouldy old antics of Conan O'Brien.",FARNSWORTH
3634,FRY,This snow is beautiful. I'm glad global warming never happened.,FRY
3635,LEELA,Actually it did. But thank God nuclear winter cancelled it out.,LEELA
3637,BENDER,"Enough of your mindless chitchat, let's get going.",BENDER
3641,FRY,Look out! We're heading straight for those trees!,FRY
3642,LEELA,"Yeah, yeah, relax. Trees down.",LEELA
3644,FRY,Cool. Hey what do you do if you want the trees up?,FRY
3648,BENDER,"Lookin' good, meatball!",BENDER
3650,BENDER,Lick my frozen metal ass.  Uh-oh!,BENDER
3654,FRY,"Yup, I remember. They came in last at the Olympics then retired to promote alcoholic beverages.",FRY
3656,FRY,"Oh, what the hell!  Ow!",FRY
3661,BENDER,Ah! Nothing like a warm fire and a Super Soaker of fine cognac.,BENDER
3662,FRY,"Yeah, it really puts you in the Christmas spirit.",FRY
3664,FRY,Christmas. You know? X-M-A-S.,FRY
3665,LEELA,"Oh, you mean Xmas. You must be using an archaic pronunciation. Like when you say ""ask"" instead of ""aks"".",LEELA
3666,FRY,"Xmas, huh?  Y'know this'll be my first Xmas away from home.",FRY
3667,LEELA,"Hey, hey. Let me aks you something: Would it cheer you up if we went and cut down an Xmas tree?",LEELA
3668,FRY,Yeah! An old-fashioned Xmas tree!,FRY
3669,FRY,Hey! These aren't Xmas trees!,FRY
3671,FRY,"They're supposed to be some kinda, you know, pine tree.",FRY
3672,FARNSWORTH,"Pine trees have been extinct for 800 years, Fry. Gone the way of the poodle and your primitive notions of modesty. Ah! Brisk!",FARNSWORTH
3673,FRY,This isn't the way Christmas is supposed to be.,FRY
3677,BENDER (SINGING),Xmas tree oh Xmas tree! Bah boo bee boo bah bee boh.,BENDER
3679,FRY,(nostalgic) Every Christmas my mom would get a fresh goose for goose burgers and my dad would whip up his special eggnog out of bourbon and ice cubes. This dumb holiday just makes me think of all the things I left behind. Let's just stop talking about Xmas.,FRY
3681,BENDER,Yes! I got the most! I win Xmas!,BENDER
3683,BENDER,"Hmm.  Ah, a picture of my mommy.",BENDER
3685,FRY,"What's the point of Xmas when everyone you know died a thousand years ago? I'm the lonliest person on Earth.  Hey, Leela, how 'bout a little sympathy here, huh?  Yoiks! What was that about?",FRY
3687,FARNSWORTH,"Yes, and the only one of her species in all the known universe. What a lonely life.",FARNSWORTH
3689,BENDER,"(upbeat) Hey, buddy, heard you needed cheering up! Well old Bender'll make you laugh.  Look at me look!  Oh, man, I gotta work on my act!",BENDER
3690,FRY,I feel like a rat. Here I am whining like a pig while all along Leela was lonely as a frog. I could kick myself.,FRY
3693,FARNSWORTH,"You should be ashamed of yourself, Fry. You'd have to be blind not to notice that Leela's a cyclops.",FARNSWORTH
3696,BENDER,Xmas Eve; Another day where I accomplish nothing.,BENDER
3701,BENDER,To volunteer at a liquor kitchen for homeless robots.,BENDER
3703,BENDER,I'm very generous. What about that time I gave blood?,BENDER
3706,FRY,I've got to do something to show Leela how sorry I am.,FRY
3708,FRY,"So it's left, left, right-- Wait! I have a better idea! I'll go out and get her the perfect Xmas present. Something so great she'll never want to be unhappy again.",FRY
3710,FRY,We'll see. I like to haggle.,FRY
3713,FARNSWORTH,Good Lord! He doesn't know about Santa Claus.,FARNSWORTH
3714,FRY,I know about Santa Claus.,FRY
3715,FARNSWORTH,"Back in 2801, the Friendly Robot Company built a robotic Santa to determine who'd be naughty and who'd been nice and distribute presents accordingly. But something went wrong.",FARNSWORTH
3717,FARNSWORTH,"Wait, you fool! Due to a programming error, Santa's standards were set too high and he invariably judges everyone to be naughty.",FARNSWORTH
3721,BENDER,"Yeah, yeah, amen. Listen, I'm one of those lazy homeless bums I've been hearing about. Could you point me to the free booze.  Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!",BENDER
3722,FRY,There's this girl who I really like but she thinks I'm a jerk. Can you help me?,FRY
3724,FRY,"No, I need to get her a gift. And I need it before sundown.",FRY
3728,BENDER,"Oh, yeah! You filthy hobos sure kow how to live.  Hey, chief, someone's stealing your handkerchief full of crap.",BENDER
3733,FRY,You're the last store open. I need something for my friend Leela.  Just give me your best animal.,FRY
3735,FRY,That's a stupid animal. You're stupid! I said I want the best one. Now which costs more? The parrot or the Stink Lizard?,FRY
3737,FRY,"That's a hell of a good parrot. Although, I could get 500 lizards for the same price. Girls like swarms of lizards, right?",FRY
3739,FRY,"Alright, I'll take the 500 lizards. No, wait, yes. No. Yes. Yes. Yes! The parrot!",FRY
3740,FRY,"Well, I spent every penny I had but I bet Leela's gonna love you.  Hey, you're quite the talker, aren't you? Shut the hell up!  Ow!  Stupid bird! I know where you live.",FRY
3742,LEELA,Sorry I stormed out before. I didn't mean to ruin everyone's Xmas.,LEELA
3744,LEELA,It's just that I get tired of Fry always only thinking of himself.,LEELA
3746,LEELA,Wait! You mean he's still out? His life's in danger!,LEELA
3748,LEELA,I'm telling you why. Santa Claus is coming to town!,LEELA
3749,FRY,"Alright, bird, you thought you could beat me in a game of wits. But you just met your equal.",FRY
3752,FRY,"Leela! Oh, my God! You saved my life. I am gonna get you so many lizards.",FRY
3753,LEELA,"You didn't need to buy me a present, Fry.",LEELA
3754,FRY,"I just wanted to do something to make you happy. I mean, I miss my family but you never even had a family.",FRY
3755,LEELA,It's OK. You're lonely and I'm lonely. But together we're lonely together.,LEELA
3762,LEELA,But we set things right. Fry even risked his life to get me a present.,LEELA
3768,BENDER,"Whoa, hold on! How about inviting us in for a traditional glass of hard cider?",BENDER
3770,BENDER,(from inside) Get her purse!,BENDER
3771,FRY,Please let us live! We'll put out milk and cookies for you!,FRY
3774,FRY,"I never thought it would end this way: Gunned down by Santa Claus. Honestly, I didn't see it coming!",FRY
3776,FRY,"Goodbye, Leela.  Hey, look: We're under the mistletoe.",FRY
3778,FRY,"Uh, you're present may need some assembly.",FRY
3779,BENDER,(singing) On the 4th day of Xmas I stole from that lady.,BENDER
3783,BENDER,(singing) And a slipper on a shoe tree.,BENDER
3786,LEELA,(shouting) Somebody help us.,LEELA
3788,BENDER,"No, wait, I know these guys. They got nothing.",BENDER
3790,BENDER,What? Me? I didn't do nothing. You're thinking of the kid.,BENDER
3796,FRY,(shouting; from outside) Help!,FRY
3797,LEELA,(shouting; from outside) Help!,LEELA
3798,BENDER,(shouting; from outside) Help!,BENDER
3799,FARNSWORTH,"Oh, dear. They'll be killed on our doorstep. And there's no trash pickup until January 3rd.",FARNSWORTH
3801,FARNSWORTH,Quick! The armour-plated chimney cover! Push! Push!,FARNSWORTH
3807,BENDER,"Yeah? Well I don't believe in Santa Claus. Come on, everybody, if you don't believe in him he can't hurt you.  Ow! God! The pain!",BENDER
3809,LEELA,Watch out! His belly is shaking like a bowl full of nitro-glycerine!,LEELA
3811,FRY,(shouting) He's gonna blow.,FRY
3813,FARNSWORTH,"Yes, good thing I got us out of that one!",FARNSWORTH
3815,FRY,"Uh, Bender? Where did you get that bird?",FRY
3816,BENDER,"I found it lying in the street, like all the food I cook. Dig in, everyone.",BENDER
3818,BENDER,You got the toenail!  Oh!,BENDER
3819,FRY,"Look, the food isn't what's important.",FRY
3821,FRY,"The important thing is we're all together for Xmas. And even though I'm surrounded by robots and monsters and old people, I've never felt more at home.",FRY
3824,FARNSWORTH (SINGING),He knows when you're on the can.,FARNSWORTH
3825,LEELA (SINGING),He'll hunt you down and blast your ass from here to Pakistan.,LEELA
3828,BENDER (SINGING),"You're better off dead, I'm telling you, dude.",BENDER
3829,FRY (SINGING),Santa Claus is gunning you down!,FRY
3836,FRY,Mmm. Mmm! Now this is what I call a thousand years of progress: A Bavarian creamdog that's also self-microwaving!,FRY
3837,BENDER,"Aw, jeez. Let's just pray I have the energy to get myself another beer. Oh, what is this? The Middle Ages?",BENDER
3838,LEELA,"Look at you guys. No offence, Fry, but you've become a fat sack of crap.",LEELA
3841,LEELA,Come on. We're taking you pigs to the gym.,LEELA
3847,FRY,Co-ed steam rooms! I love the future!,FRY
3848,LEELA,"Uh, Fry, you're in the womens' steam room.",LEELA
3851,LEELA,Those poor 20th century women.,LEELA
3854,FRY,"Hey, Leela, look who's the super-stud!",FRY
3855,LEELA,"Hmm, somebody must have turned down the gravity. I'll fix it for you.",LEELA
3857,FRY,"Hey, Dr. Zoidberg, what's that jazz on your head?",FRY
3859,LEELA,Maybe you could do more rips with less weight.,LEELA
3860,BENDER,"Hey, looks like Zoidberg's finally coming out of his shell.  Get it?  He's coming out--",BENDER
3863,LEELA,I wonder why Dr. Zoidberg is acting this way. Out of all of us he always seemed the most normal.,LEELA
3866,FRY,Maybe he has a parasite.,FRY
3868,BENDER,It's always so sad when a friend goes crazy and you have to have a big clam-bake and cook him! Yee-haw!,BENDER
3869,FARNSWORTH,"Now, now, this won't do. Let me just give old Zoidy a sedative.",FARNSWORTH
3873,FRY,"(simultaneously) No, Amy!",FRY
3875,FARNSWORTH,Mm-hm...  Oh-ho!  Aha! There's the problem.,FARNSWORTH
3877,FARNSWORTH,"Relax, my chiton-y chum. There's no problem. You're just heavy with male jelly.",FARNSWORTH
3879,FARNSWORTH,It must be mating season for Zoidberg's people. A chaotic time when his behaviour is dictated by the tiny brain in his rump.,FARNSWORTH
3881,FARNSWORTH,There's only one thing we can do...,FARNSWORTH
3882,BENDER,I'll get the water boiling!,BENDER
3883,FARNSWORTH,"...We, by which I mean you, will have to rush him to his ancient homeworld which will shortly erupt in an orgy of invertebrate sex.",FARNSWORTH
3885,LEELA,"Fry, do you even understand the word ""invertebrate""?",LEELA
3886,FRY,"Nope, but that's not the word I'm interested in. (shouting) Uh, no need to pack pants, people. Let's roll!",FRY
3892,FRY,"Is that how you say ""Zoidberg""?",FRY
3894,BENDER,"You're looking less nuts, crabby.",BENDER
3896,FRY,Who's the lucky lobsterina?,FRY
3898,LEELA,It's amazing that your people can fall in love so fast.,LEELA
3900,FRY,"You and me both, brother!",FRY
3903,BENDER,"Look! Outdoor theatre! Let's get tickets. Oh, let's do!",BENDER
3905,FRY,I didn't come here to see any activity involving two guys. Where do you people do your erotic display?,FRY
3910,FRY,"Hey, I wonder if these guys are here to watch the erotic display too.",FRY
3913,FRY,Look how ridiculous they look.,FRY
3914,BENDER,"Please, he's no different from the rest of you organisms; Shooting DNA at each other make babies. I find it offensive.",BENDER
3922,LEELA,Why is Zoidberg the only one still alone?,LEELA
3923,BENDER,"'Cause he's a loser, that's why. He's the lobster equivalent of Fry.",BENDER
3924,FRY,Hey! I can get any girl I want anytime I want. I'm just too busy.,FRY
3932,LEELA,At least you didn't smell as bad as them.,LEELA
3934,FRY,"Listen, Doc, if you wanna score you gotta fake like you're in love.  Just look her in the eye, start crying and say (fake crying) ""I've never been so happy"".",FRY
3935,LEELA,If a guy ever did that to me I'd know it. Wait a second. They've all been doing that to me. Even Sean!,LEELA
3937,FRY,"OK, you're on a date. What's the first thing you do?",FRY
3939,FRY,No. Tell her she's special.,FRY
3941,FRY,"Well, tell her that. And then?",FRY
3943,FRY,No. Make up some feelings and tell her you have them.  Yes?,FRY
3945,FRY,You're not even trying!,FRY
3947,FRY,"OK, OK, don't worry. The love meister will take you under his wing.",FRY
3952,FRY,"(whispering) You just wanna talk, it has nothing to do with mating.",FRY
3955,FRY,(whispering) Start with a compliment: Tell her she looks thin.,FRY
3958,FRY,(whispering) Now ask her how her day was.,FRY
3960,FRY,(whispering) You wouldn't. Ask anyway.,FRY
3964,FRY,"(whispering) That's normal. Just nod your head and say ""Uh-huh""",FRY
3968,FRY,(whispering) Third date!,FRY
3969,BENDER,So I returned his artificial heart and ever since then I've been known by the name of Honest Bender.,BENDER
3971,FRY,(whispering) Turn it over.,FRY
3974,FRY,That's the most beautiful thing I've ever heard.,FRY
3978,FRY,Nope. Must be some weird alien emotion.,FRY
3979,LEELA,"Zoidberg said some dumb stuff but he's a nice guy, really. It's just that Fry's been telling him what to say and Fry's a ... do you have idiots on your planet?",LEELA
3981,LEELA,"Yeah ... What? Look, never mind the words. Zoidberg's a doctor. A doctor honey.",LEELA
3985,FRY,No thanks. I just came to tell you that Zoidberg's really great. He's got male jelly coming out the wazoo.,FRY
3987,FRY,"Uh, I'm flattered, really. If I was gonna do it with a big, freaky mud bug you'd be way up the list!",FRY
3990,FRY,"Dr. Zoidberg, it's not how it looks.",FRY
4003,LEELA,"Dr. Zoidberg, this is madness. You're being irrational.",LEELA
4007,LEELA,"Right, right.  You have to stop this madness.",LEELA
4009,BENDER,"Fate is cruel and unyielding and what must be must be. (shouting) Takin' all bets! I'm giving 9-2 on Zoidberg, the crab with the jab! The Great Red Hope, come on baby!",BENDER
4019,FRY,Shh! Nobody correct him!,FRY
4020,BENDER,"Fry, I've never asked you for anything before but if it's not too much trouble, when it comes to the ninth round just let him win.",BENDER
4021,FRY,But it's a fight to the death!,FRY
4022,BENDER,"Oh, so this is suddenly all about you. Sheesh!",BENDER
4028,LEELA,"(shouting) Come on, Fry! Die with dignity!",LEELA
4032,BENDER,"Psst, Fry. Take a dive.",BENDER
4034,FRY,"My fellow fish monsters. Far be it for me to question your stupid civilisation or its dumb customs. But is squeezing each others brains out with a giant nutcracker really going to solve anything? Dr. Zoidberg is my friend. And though a woman has come between us, I say we'll always remain friends. And you know why?  One reason.",FRY
4035,FRY,You bastard! I'll kill you! You bastard!,FRY
4036,LEELA,Wait! Stop! Everyone is gone.,LEELA
4048,BENDER,Shoo! Get away! Hey! What's with the flying jerks?,BENDER
4050,FRY,You mean you have to choose between a life without sex and a gruesome death?,FRY
4060,FRY,"I don't mean to nitpick, super-doc, but do you think maybe you could take one more whack at this?",FRY
4070,BENDER,Mind if I tag along? I gotta bring my ass in for servicing.  The recall notice says it could burst into flames in a low-speed collision.,BENDER
4071,FRY,No wonder you've been staying at the back of conga lines lately.,FRY
4072,LEELA,"I'll get my coat. Let's go, Bender.",LEELA
4074,LEELA,Uh-huh. Now tell us she's witty and sophisticated.,LEELA
4077,FRY,"Yup, she's beautiful coffee alright.",FRY
4079,FRY,"Sorry, I'm not here to buy.",FRY
4081,FRY,I care! I care plenty! I just don't know how to make them stop!,FRY
4090,BENDER,"You, sir, have defaced a national treasure! I demand you restore my buttocks to their former glory.",BENDER
4094,LEELA,"OK, the sticker says 55,000 but we'll only go as high as say--",LEELA
4097,LEELA,"Amy, you don't go up from the sticker price.",LEELA
4103,LEELA,Hermes. Who were you yelling at?,LEELA
4105,FRY,"Valentine's Day's coming? Oh, crap! I forgot to get a girlfriend again. Well since neither of us has a date, why don't we...",FRY
4106,LEELA,You just assume I can't get a Valentine's date?,LEELA
4107,FRY,Shall we say 8 o'clock?,FRY
4109,FRY,"Yeah, OK. What's the weather like?",FRY
4112,FRY,"Boy, this A.C. is incredible!  I'd better turn on the heater too.  (shouting) Boy, this heater is incredible! I'd better turn up the A.C. some more.",FRY
4114,FRY,(shouting) Yeah!  We're slowing down!,FRY
4116,FRY,(shouting) Who wants pop-tarts?  Uh-oh!,FRY
4122,FRY,"Hey, tell me something: You've got all this money, how come you always dress like you're doing your laundry?",FRY
4124,FRY,"I've been there. My folks were always on me to groom myself and wear underpants. What am I, the Pope?",FRY
4126,FRY,"Yeah, it's like we feel the same way about junk and stuff, or, whatever.",FRY
4135,FRY,And it led there again when we got home.,FRY
4136,BENDER,"Congratulations, Fry, you snagged the perfect girlfriend. Amy's rich, she's probably got other characteristics.",BENDER
4137,LEELA,Bender! Romance isn't about money.,LEELA
4138,BENDER,"Oh, so it's just coincidence that Zoidberg here is desperately poor and miserably lonely? Puh-lease!",BENDER
4139,LEELA,"For your information, it's because he's hideous.",LEELA
4141,FARNSWORTH,Do I hear wedding bells?,FARNSWORTH
4145,BENDER,Wait. You mean people will pay good money for romance? Hmm. I think I have a scheme so deviously clever that I--,BENDER
4147,BENDER,"Stupid anti-pimping laws.  Well, pay the man!",BENDER
4149,BENDER,"Shut up, baby, I know it!",BENDER
4150,BENDER,"Ah, computer dating. It's like pimping but you rarely have to use the phrase ""upside your head"".",BENDER
4151,LEELA,"Bender, this is stupid. Why would anyone come to you for romantic help?",LEELA
4152,BENDER,Hey! Don't make me go upside your head!,BENDER
4155,FRY,"(whispering) It's working, they think we're making out.  Wait, why aren't we making out?",FRY
4159,BENDER,Just check off the things you're looking for in a love partner.,BENDER
4161,BENDER,Now to run it through our high speed romance-a-logical data-fier.  Say hello to Miss Right!,BENDER
4163,FRY,Wow! We're great kissers!,FRY
4165,FRY,"Hey, yeah! I used to spit at stuff back in the 20th century. Ah, it's cool how we sort of think exactly alike, and junk.",FRY
4167,FRY,"Everything was going great. Then all of a sudden, she's talking about hanging out. Hangin out? She's getting way too serious. I'm not a one woman man, Leela.",FRY
4168,LEELA,You'll be back to zero soon enough.,LEELA
4169,FRY,Don't you get it? She's smothering me.,FRY
4171,FRY,You see? You see? Now she's bothering me when I'm at work.,FRY
4173,FRY,I'm doing my job -- there's Amy. I spend a few hours selecting a candy from the machine -- there's Amy. I wake up the morning after sleeping with Amy -- there's Amy!,FRY
4174,LEELA,I think you're over reacting.,LEELA
4175,FRY,"Am I? (shouting) Am I? (talking) Face it, I'm a prize catch.  I mean, I'm pulling down delivery boy money.",FRY
4176,LEELA,"Fry, she's pulling down billionaire trust-fund money.",LEELA
4177,FRY,"Then she wants me as a trophy husband. Leela, you gotta come to Europa with us, I can't be alone with her.",FRY
4179,FRY,"Hey, you know who loves secluded picnics with just you and me?  Uh, Dr. Zoidberg.",FRY
4183,FRY,"Jeez, we're already planning to spend Valentine's Day together. Isn't that enough?",FRY
4185,FRY,"Oh, so all of a sudden we're spending Valentine's Day together?",FRY
4187,FRY,"That's it, Amy, we have to talk. Zoidberg, you drive.",FRY
4189,FRY,"(from inside) Pardon me, excuse me.",FRY
4191,FRY,"Amy, you know how at first you like chocolate but then you start to get tired of it because it always wants to hang out with you?",FRY
4193,FRY,"Look, could chocolate just let me finish?",FRY
4195,FRY,"Amy, what I'm trying to say is, I think maybe you and I should stop--",FRY
4198,FRY,Ow! My head is killing me. What happened? Was anybody hurt?,FRY
4205,LEELA,This sort of thing always happens with office romances.,LEELA
4207,FRY,"Well, Amy, I'll try not to interfere with your life too much.",FRY
4209,FRY,"Ooh, sorry. I guess I control that arm.",FRY
4211,FRY,"Oh, that.  Maybe we'd better talk in private. (whispering) I'll meet you in the closet.",FRY
4212,FRY,"Amy, I really like you, as a friend. But I think we're spending too much time together.",FRY
4214,FRY,I just think we should start seeing other people.,FRY
4220,FRY,"Hey, I can get a date too. Now that I'm single, I'll attract all sorts of women!",FRY
4222,FRY,(happy) Oh! (disappointed) Oh!,FRY
4224,BENDER,"Are you familiar with my friend Al Gore? I'm tellin' ya, losers get really desperate around Valentine's Day.",BENDER
4225,LEELA,"Yeah, it's pathetic alright!  How much?",LEELA
4231,FRY,"Oh, hey, Leela, uh, can I talk to you for a minute?  In private?",FRY
4233,FRY,"This is an emergency. Amy made Valentine's plans with some goon and I'm gonna be stuck there, lonely and miserable. Will you be my date, please?",FRY
4234,LEELA,"You're too late, Fry. I'm sharing Valentine's Day with a very special man. He's not Zapp Brannigan or anything!",LEELA
4235,FRY,Then I have no choice but to do something so pitiful and embarrassing that I'm ashamed to tell you about it.,FRY
4236,LEELA,Bender's in his office.,LEELA
4238,BENDER,"I got your hook-up, Fry. Now my usual fee's 500 bucks, but seeing as how it's you, I'll need it in advance.",BENDER
4240,FRY,Why exactly did you shave your legs anyway? Are you expecting something to happen with your Valentine's date?,FRY
4242,FRY,And another thing: You're using an awful lot of make-up there.,FRY
4247,FRY,20 minutes? You're practically ready now!,FRY
4252,FRY,(simultaneously) Thanks.  Where is she?,FRY
4255,FRY,I've got a date. She'll be along any minute.,FRY
4256,BENDER,"Fry, look who I found! It's Petunia, your dream girl!",BENDER
4260,FRY,(whispering) She seems a little old for me.,FRY
4261,BENDER,She is well-travelled. And I don't mean she travels a lot!,BENDER
4263,BENDER,Now how about a rose for the lady? Five bucks a pop!,BENDER
4265,FRY,"Oh, yeah? Well I want one too.",FRY
4268,BENDER,"Demand suddenly skyrocketed, you all saw it.",BENDER
4269,BENDER,"Leela, meets your future husband Sal.",BENDER
4272,BENDER,"Ooh, sparks! (whispering) Buy her a rose, I guarantee she'll put out!",BENDER
4279,FRY,"No, but I control this arm.",FRY
4281,FRY,"Wait, come back, uh, darling.",FRY
4286,LEELA,(whispering) Bender! Did you just round up our dates at the bus station?,LEELA
4293,FRY,"Hey, I have an idea: Let's all go out for ice cream.",FRY
4299,FRY,Nooo!  That's it I'm gettin' the hell outta here.  Ooh! Ow!,FRY
4300,LEELA,"Why, if it isn't my favourite head on Amy's body: Fry.",LEELA
4303,LEELA,"Nonsense, the evening's young. So, Gary, what do you do for a living?",LEELA
4305,LEELA,Really? Y'know I heard that banking industry regulations are really very simple.,LEELA
4313,FARNSWORTH,I still don't understand why you wouldn't let me graft a laser cannon onto your chest. To crush those who disobey you. But I guess we're just two different people.,FARNSWORTH
4314,FRY,"So, uh, thanks for the ride, Amy. And I hope there are no hard feelings about your date, or stuff.",FRY
4316,FRY,"Well, anyway, it's nice to have my own body back.",FRY
4317,LEELA,So how's the old corpse? Everything hooked up OK?,LEELA
4318,FRY,"Seems to be. My neck's just a little tender.  Ow! Cool!  Ow! Listen, Leela. Thanks for rescuing me last night.",FRY
4319,LEELA,Anytime. I actually enjoyed hanging out with you.,LEELA
4320,BENDER,"Yep, everything worked out great thanks to good old Bender.",BENDER
4321,LEELA,Come on! It's not like you intentionally set us up with bad dates so we'd spend Valentine's Day together.,LEELA
4322,BENDER,"Didn't I, Leela? Didn't I?",BENDER
4323,LEELA,No! You didn't! You just corralled a bunch of stiffs at the bus station and pocketed our money!,LEELA
4324,BENDER,"True. But in the end, isn't that what Valentine's Day is really all about?",BENDER
4326,FRY,I guess so.  Watch the neck! Watch the neck!,FRY
4327,BENDER,My ass! My beautiful ass!,BENDER
4342,LEELA,"Hey Bender, I thought you said you were in this episode.",LEELA
4343,BENDER,"Nah, this week I'm on Caught On Tape 3 because of what I did in the coffee pot.",BENDER
4346,BENDER,(tense and impatient) Shut up and get to the point!,BENDER
4351,LEELA,Sounds like your kinda place Fry. Wanna go?,LEELA
4352,FRY,Nah. If I ever wanna go back to the year 2000 I'll just freeze myself again.,FRY
4353,BENDER,"C'mon Fry, I really wanna see it. You know how I yearn for a simpler time. A time of barn dances and buggy rides, before life was cheapened by heartless hi-tech machines.",BENDER
4355,BENDER,Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah...,BENDER
4356,FRY,"Cool, it's just like the good old days!",FRY
4358,FRY,"Hey Leela, get a picture of me being ""mugged.""",FRY
4361,LEELA,"Ooo, ancient Wall Street.",LEELA
4365,LEELA,Do you know what it means?,LEELA
4366,FRY,"Yeah I asked a cop once. It means ""Up yours kid.""",FRY
4367,BENDER,"I gotta say I'm really enjoying the day out with you people - Hey, a suicide booth! So long suckers.",BENDER
4368,FRY,"Uh, sorry Bender that's just a phone booth.",FRY
4370,LEELA,What were they used for?,LEELA
4371,FRY,In New York? Bathrooms.,FRY
4372,LEELA,Oh. I-I'll be out in a sec.,LEELA
4373,LEELA,(reading) Tokens only. (talking) How does this work?,LEELA
4376,LEELA,What's this?  Another bathroom?,LEELA
4377,FRY,"No, it's a mobile apartment with no rent.",FRY
4379,LEELA,Wow! The burial chamber of the 20th century's greatest spiritual leader - Al Sharpton.,LEELA
4380,BENDER,Wow. Now this guy had taste!,BENDER
4381,LEELA,It says he was mummified in ceremonial vestments.,LEELA
4382,FRY,We sometimes called it a jogging suit.,FRY
4386,BENDER,We've come a long way baby!,BENDER
4388,FRY,"Hey, my girlfriend had one of those! Actually it wasn't her's it was her dad's. Actually she wasn't my girlfriend. She just lived next door and never closed her curtains.",FRY
4389,LEELA,"Fry, remember when I told you about always ending your stories a sentence earlier?",LEELA
4390,FRY,"C'mon, let's sneak in for a closer look.",FRY
4392,FRY,"Hey! This is from Miller's Outpo - uh, I mean, yeah, I work here alright!",FRY
4394,LEELA,Did you drive much in the 20th century Fry?,LEELA
4395,FRY,Nope.  No one in New York drove. There was too much traffic.  Nice! Listen to that baby purr!,FRY
4396,BENDER,There's a baby in there huh?,BENDER
4397,FRY,It's just like riding a bicyc -,FRY
4398,BENDER,I think I got whiplash.,BENDER
4399,LEELA,"You can't have whiplash, you don't have a neck.",LEELA
4401,FRY,I'm just glad we hit something. I thought we'd never stop.,FRY
4403,FRY,How's that robot I ran over?,FRY
4407,FARNSWORTH,"Leela, Zoidberg, the rest of you, this is Flexo.",FARNSWORTH
4410,BENDER,"Hey brobot, what's you serial number?",BENDER
4412,BENDER,No way! Mine's 2716057!,BENDER
4414,BENDER,We're both expressable as the sum of two cubes.,BENDER
4415,FRY,"So uh, Flexo. Sorry about crushing your body like that. You OK now?",FRY
4417,FRY,Well just let me know if there's anything I can do to make it up to you.,FRY
4423,FRY,Uh I can't get any lower than this.,FRY
4429,FRY,I don't like this place. It's 120 degrees and there's very little oxygen.,FRY
4430,BENDER,"Shut up and hoot.  Hubba-hubba, she is built! In Mexico I believe.",BENDER
4432,FRY,"(unsure) Uh, yeah. Look at that exhaust fan.",FRY
4438,FRY,"Uh, no, that's alright.  Ow! Ow!",FRY
4439,FRY,I'm telling you there's something about Flexo I don't like.,FRY
4442,FRY,Yeah keep laughing brineshrimp but he's bad news. I regret ever running him over.,FRY
4444,FRY,"He's much worse. He drinks, he smokes and he posts naked pictures of me on the internet.",FRY
4446,FRY,I'm talking about Flexo.,FRY
4447,LEELA,"Oh I get it, this is cute. You're jealous of Bender's new friend!",LEELA
4448,FRY,No I'm not. Mark my words. Flexo's evil. He's the evil Bender.,FRY
4450,FARNSWORTH,Everyone get in bed with me. I have something to show you.  Feast your eyes on this!,FARNSWORTH
4455,FARNSWORTH,"It's a single atom of jumbonium. And element so rare, the nucleus alone is worth more than $50,000.",FARNSWORTH
4457,FARNSWORTH,"100,000. That's why I hid it here. Under my mattress.",FARNSWORTH
4458,LEELA,"Uh Professor, can we discuss this somewhere else?",LEELA
4460,FARNSWORTH,"The atom sits atop this dime stored tiara which will be awarded to the winner of this years Miss Universe pageant on the planet Tova 9.  Your job is to deliver it, safe and sound.",FARNSWORTH
4466,FARNSWORTH,"Due to the atom's tremendous value, Planet Express would go bankrupt if it was stolen. Therefore we'll need to hire on additional security for the mission.",FARNSWORTH
4468,FRY,"Uh, maybe we should stick with people we know and trust. I mean, Flexo's great but -",FRY
4469,FARNSWORTH,Flexo's great you say? Well that's good enough for me.  Welcome aboard lad.,FARNSWORTH
4470,LEELA,"Space banditos have been operating in this quadrant so you'll each take 8-hour shifts guarding the safe. First Bender, then Flexo, then Fry.",LEELA
4471,FRY,"Wait, I don't like the sound of that. Let's just go alphabetically.",FRY
4472,LEELA,"OK. First Bender, then Flexo, then Fry.",LEELA
4473,FRY,"Wait, let's go by rank.",FRY
4474,LEELA,"OK. First Bender, then Flexo, then Fry.",LEELA
4478,FRY,Don't point that at me.,FRY
4480,FRY,"Look, I know Flexo's your friend but I don't trust him alone with the atom.",FRY
4481,BENDER,"My God Fry just 'cause the guy's got a beard you label him as evil? Well I got a label for you pal. An ugly little word called ""prejudice.""",BENDER
4483,BENDER,Ah save it for the cross burning Adolf!,BENDER
4488,FRY,Caught you!  I saw you looking at the atom!,FRY
4490,FRY,Oh-ho you'd like it if I went to sleep wouldn't you?,FRY
4492,FRY,Yeah well here's a funny joke. I'm gonna sit right here till it's my shift.,FRY
4501,FRY,"Well, that's eight hours.",FRY
4503,FRY,"Finally, the atom is safe.",FRY
4504,LEELA,What is it?  My God! Did you hear maracas?,LEELA
4506,LEELA,"Then it wasn't space banditos.  Bender, lock down the ship, don't let Flexo escape.",LEELA
4507,BENDER,Aye aye captain. It appears that Flexo has outwitted us all. Especially me...Bender.,BENDER
4508,LEELA,How could Flexo have stolen the atom?,LEELA
4509,FRY,He must have used a sleep ray on me. Sleep rays exist in the future right?,FRY
4511,FRY,Then I must've fallen asleep.,FRY
4512,LEELA,Well you were sure right about Flexo being evil.,LEELA
4513,BENDER,I locked down the ship but he may have already gotten away.,BENDER
4514,LEELA,"OK, thanks Bender. Let's fan out and look for him.",LEELA
4515,BENDER,"Roger that, I got a map of the ship right here.",BENDER
4516,LEELA,(whispering) Keep an eye on Fry. We can't rule out the possibility that he did it.,LEELA
4518,FRY,Aha!  Uh searching...hmm.,FRY
4519,LEELA,Fry? Why are you looking for Flexo in my underpants drawer?,LEELA
4520,FRY,I didn't find him here 10 minutes ago so I thought it was time to check again.,FRY
4521,BENDER,"Well, he wasn't in the uh, kitchen room.",BENDER
4522,FRY,"(suspicious) Say Bender, can I hold that map for a second?",FRY
4523,BENDER,Any leave me high and dry in case of a scavenger hunt? I think not.,BENDER
4525,BENDER,"Alright, take it. Sheesh.",BENDER
4526,LEELA,"Well, looks like Flexo got away clean.",LEELA
4528,LEELA,He must have jumped ship with the atom the second we landed.,LEELA
4529,FRY,"Or maybe, he never left at all!  Wait a minute. You're Bender.",FRY
4530,BENDER,"Of course, who said I wasn't?",BENDER
4531,FRY,"But why were you wearing that scarf, that turtleneck and this fruity number?",FRY
4532,BENDER,"It's a little thing called ""style."" Look it up sometime.",BENDER
4536,LEELA,(whispering) Downplay the tiara.,LEELA
4543,FRY,"Well, we'll be leaving now. If you'll just sign this form saying you received the atom.",FRY
4547,LEELA,"Well gentlemen, it appears we're boned.",LEELA
4553,BENDER,"Shoot him, he's choking me!",BENDER
4555,LEELA,I don't know which one to shoot.,LEELA
4558,LEELA,"Alright, enough of this.  There's the atom!",LEELA
4560,FRY,Bender? You stole the atom?,FRY
4561,BENDER,"Yeah but I can explain, it's very valuable.",BENDER
4563,FRY,"Whoa whoa, you mean Bender is the evil Bender? I am shocked, shocked! Well not that shocked.",FRY
4564,LEELA,"I'm sorry we suspected you Flexo. It's just, what with the beard and all.",LEELA
4566,FRY,I'm so confused. The Bender I liked turn out to be evil and the Bender I hated was good. How can I live my life when I can't tell good from evil?,FRY
4567,BENDER,"Eh, they're both fine choices, whatever floats your boat.",BENDER
4574,LEELA,"It figures. Who else but Zapp Brannigan would be judging the most chauvinistic, degrading, dehumanising -",LEELA
4576,LEELA,"Wait, you're making a -  Ooo! Look at that.  I feel like a princess.",LEELA
4578,LEELA,I almost had that tiara.,LEELA
4580,FRY,"Well, you guys might both be losers but I just made out with that radiator woman from the radiator planet.",FRY
4581,LEELA,"Fry, that's a radiator.",LEELA
4582,FRY,Oh.  Is there a burn ward within 10 feet of here?,FRY
4585,FARNSWORTH,"Good news, everyone. I've taught the toaster to feel love.  And Hermes returns from his vacation today.",FARNSWORTH
4594,FRY,Hermes has all the fun. Wait a second! He's got a Brain Slug on his head!,FRY
4595,LEELA,(whispering) Shh! You're gonna get us all assimilated!,LEELA
4600,FARNSWORTH,"Sounds great, Hermes! Whatever you say. (whispering) Let's ditch him and go to the movies!",FARNSWORTH
4603,FRY,"Cool, let's see this one!",FRY
4604,LEELA,"Nah. I'm not in the mood for a historical documentary. I've heard good things about Quizblorg, Quizblorg.",LEELA
4607,BENDER,Who invited you? Let's just see All My Circuits: The Movie.,BENDER
4608,FRY,"Yeah, I wanna see that.",FRY
4610,FRY,I'll take a small Slurm.,FRY
4613,BENDER,"Hey, gimmie a large diet malt liquor and a popcorn with extra motor oil.",BENDER
4616,FRY,"(sarcastic) Ooh, this is real futuristic!",FRY
4619,BENDER,"(shouting) Go Masked Unit!  Uh, hey, buddy! Yo!  You mind taking your head off?",BENDER
4621,BENDER,Just ask Flabby over here to describe it to you later.,BENDER
4623,BENDER,Well they should have stopped making her about halfway through.,BENDER
4634,BENDER,"(mocking) ""Pardon me, sir. But you seem to be bleh bleh...""",BENDER
4638,BENDER,(fake shocked) Who threw that?!,BENDER
4643,LEELA,"Bender, do you know who that was?",LEELA
4647,BENDER,You should see me at funerals.,BENDER
4649,BENDER,Ultimate Robot Fighting? Sounds pleasant! I'll do it.,BENDER
4651,FARNSWORTH,Aw. They don't make movies like this anymore.,FARNSWORTH
4652,BENDER,"I'm gonna be the greatest Ultimate Robot Fighter ever. Float like a floatbot, sting like an automatic stinging machine!",BENDER
4655,FARNSWORTH,"There are no rules. Two robots enter, one robot leaves. Then later the other robot leaves after being declared the winner.",FARNSWORTH
4656,BENDER,"Well, that doesn't sound so bad.",BENDER
4657,FARNSWORTH,"Oh, did I mention the crippling, agonising pain? I'm pretty sure I did. Oh, yes, definitely.",FARNSWORTH
4658,BENDER,Crippling pain? That's not covered by my insurance fraud! Count me out.,BENDER
4659,LEELA,No! You've got to do it. I don't care how suicidal it is.,LEELA
4660,FRY,Hey! How come when I wanna do fun stuff that'll kill me you're against it?,FRY
4661,LEELA,"This is more important than that marble-eating contest, Fry! It's about pride. Let me tell you a story from my childhood.",LEELA
4663,LEELA,"When I was growing up at the orphanarium, I got picked on a lot...",LEELA
4664,LEELA,(voice-over) ...My only outlet was Arcturan Kung Fu.,LEELA
4666,LEELA,"But, Master Fnog, I can beat these dorks with one eye closed.",LEELA
4668,LEELA,What do you mean? Watch this!,LEELA
4671,LEELA,That's it. I'll take you on right now.,LEELA
4673,LEELA,I lost my chance to be a champion. I won't let you throw away yours.,LEELA
4674,BENDER,Leela's right! I don't wanna end up a loser like her. Count me back in!,BENDER
4675,LEELA,Let's see what you got. Touch your toes.,LEELA
4676,BENDER,Still ... can't ... reach!,BENDER
4677,BENDER,Let's commence preparations for rumbling!,BENDER
4679,FRY,(shouting) Bender rules!,FRY
4681,FRY,"Wow! Thanks, Hermes!  I-- Hey! Cut that out!",FRY
4682,BENDER,You can't hit what you can't see!,BENDER
4683,LEELA,"Get up, Bender. You can't quit every time you get an axe in the back.  Or a drill through your face. Now quit scratching your axe-hole and get out there.",LEELA
4687,BENDER,"Y'know, I think I he might be dead. I took a life!",BENDER
4689,BENDER,"Hey, he's not dead. What's up with that?",BENDER
4691,BENDER,You mean I'm not a great fighter? I just won 'cause I'm popular?,BENDER
4695,BENDER,Go Bender! Go Bender! Go Bender!,BENDER
4697,BENDER,I'm just an ex-con trying to go straight and get my kids back.,BENDER
4703,BENDER,"You know, I'm also an Ultimate Robot Lover.",BENDER
4704,LEELA,Bender! You're three hours late. You can't give up on your training now after both of us worked so hard.,LEELA
4705,BENDER,"What do you mean, ""we""?",BENDER
4707,BENDER,"Hey, Bender the Offender doesn't need you. Bender the Offender doesn't need anybody!",BENDER
4709,BENDER,Well obviously I need floozies! Let's roll!,BENDER
4710,BENDER,"Howdy, chief. For my next bout, what do you say I fight these two bimbos in some mud?",BENDER
4712,BENDER,What if I told your we wouldn't be fighting in the conventional sense?,BENDER
4715,BENDER,"Those morons! I said pea berry, not sandalwood!",BENDER
4717,BENDER,But the crowd loves me.,BENDER
4720,BENDER,"Oh, yeah?  Well what if I don't let the new guy win?",BENDER
4723,BENDER,(squeaky) See you at the fight.,BENDER
4724,BENDER,"So then I said, ""See you at the fight"". And that's the story.",BENDER
4725,FRY,"Man, I thought Ultimate Robot Fighting was real, like pro wrestling. But it turns out it's fixed, like boxing.",FRY
4726,BENDER,"It's one thing to win a fixed fight -- there's dignity in that. But to lose? And in this atrocity? I can't do it! Leela, you gotta train me to win.",BENDER
4727,LEELA,"No way! If you wouldn't take my help when you didn't need it, why should I give it to you now when you do need it?",LEELA
4728,FARNSWORTH,What the hell are you talking about?,FARNSWORTH
4729,LEELA,I don't know. But I'm not helping.,LEELA
4735,LEELA,"Not Fnog! Bender, let's hit the gym. I'm gonna teach you to fight like a girl!",LEELA
4736,BENDER,(determined) I'll put on my tutu!,BENDER
4741,LEELA,"According to the script, you're supposed to prance out and tickle him with your fairy wand. Instead, I want you to prance out and kick his head off!",LEELA
4742,BENDER,"Got it. Large kickle, hold the tickle!",BENDER
4744,BENDER,"Sorry, buddy. Here you go!",BENDER
4747,FARNSWORTH,"Oh, good. Just let me put on my reading glasses.  Why, Zoidberg, there's a lovely photo of you in here.",FARNSWORTH
4753,LEELA,"Keep laughing, Fnog!  Ready, Bender?",LEELA
4754,BENDER,"I was born ready! Gimmie the bell! Did you hear a noise?  Final boarding call for flight 406, non-stop service to pain.  Now boarding standby passengers--",BENDER
4756,BENDER,"(weakly) Fry! Throw in the towel!  For God's sakes, Fry!",BENDER
4759,LEELA,"OK, Fnog, that's enough. Call him off. Fnog?  Hmm.",LEELA
4760,BENDER,Why won't anyone help me?,BENDER
4761,LEELA,"So, once more we meet again.",LEELA
4763,LEELA,"You didn't train Destructor. You're just controlling him like a puppet. I mean, cheating in a fake fight. That's low!",LEELA
4765,LEELA,"(ironic) Oh, right. Girls lack the will of the warrior!",LEELA
4766,BENDER,Huh? It's bendering time!  Take this. And this!,BENDER
4768,BENDER,"I think you misunderstood the concept of ""bendering time""!",BENDER
4776,FRY,Bender? How did the fight go? I heard somebody got flattened!,FRY
4778,FARNSWORTH,Poor little guy starved to death.,FARNSWORTH
4779,LEELA,"I'm proud of you, Bender. Sure, you lost. You lost bad. But the important thing is I beat up someone who hurt my feelings in high school.",LEELA
4780,BENDER,I'm in tremendous pain here.,BENDER
4782,BENDER,Yes! I'm the greatest! The greatest!,BENDER
4789,FARNSWORTH,"Good news everyone! Several years ago I tried to log on to AOL, and it just went through! Wheee! We're online!",FARNSWORTH
4790,FARNSWORTH,Go ahead! Get into these net suits. I designed and tested them myself.,FARNSWORTH
4791,LEELA,It smells like burning recess monkey.,LEELA
4792,FARNSWORTH,Really? I guess when you're around it all day you stop noticing. Off you go.,FARNSWORTH
4795,FRY,My God! It's full of ads!,FRY
4798,LEELA,It's got every piece of information anyone could ever want.,LEELA
4802,BENDER,No it isn't. I just took some pictures of your face and stuck them on someone else's body.,BENDER
4807,BENDER,I'm telling you Fry they've got a chatroom for everybody. And here it is.,BENDER
4809,LEELA,Yeah. I'll stick with this one thank you.,LEELA
4811,BENDER (SEXFULLY),"Hi, I'm a naughty nurse and I really need someone to talk to. 9.95 a minute.",BENDER
4813,BENDER,So how 'bout them Knicks?,BENDER
4818,LEELA,"I'm a woman if that's what you mean. I don't like to play games so I'll just say I'm a cyclops, I'm a spaceship captain, I'm the only one of my species and I'm interested in meeting a man.",LEELA
4820,FRY,"Well, thanks to the internet, I'm bored with sex. Is there a place on the web that panders to my lust for violence?",FRY
4821,BENDER (SARCASTIC),Is the space pope reptilian?,BENDER
4823,LEELA,"We call it a ""video game.""",LEELA
4824,FRY (SARCASTIC),"Uh, ""video game"" you say? Well golly gee, you mighty spacemen of the future will have to show me how it works.",FRY
4826,FARNSWORTH,"Everyone please sign off, we have a delivery. Plus I have to use the phone -  Leela please tell the others that -",FARNSWORTH
4829,LEELA,I can't believe it. I've dreamed of this moment all my life.,LEELA
4831,LEELA,"Fry, you idiot. Ever since I was abandoned on Earth I've been searching for who my people are and where they come from. Then I finally meet another Cyclops and you blast him. You wrecked my one chance to learn who I am.",LEELA
4832,FRY,Oh Leela. I feel terrible. If there's anything I can ever do -  Gotcha!  I won! I'm the greatest!,FRY
4833,LEELA,Come on. We have worked to do.,LEELA
4834,FRY,Are you still mad at me for wrecking your once in a lifetime chance to learn the meaning of your existence?,FRY
4835,LEELA,"No, I'm just happy you were able to win a video game. Now lets concentrate on getting this desperately needed popcorn to the people of Cineplex 14 OK?",LEELA
4841,FRY,Too bad we gotta make that urgent popcorn delivery.,FRY
4843,LEELA,After a whole life of searching I may finally have found where I belong.,LEELA
4845,LEELA,Look at that statue. It's only got one eye.,LEELA
4848,LEELA,Alkazar?  Are you real? Or am I seeing single?,LEELA
4850,LEELA,"After all this time. Somebody else with one eye who isn't a clumsy carpenter or, uh, a kid with a BB gun.",LEELA
4854,LEELA,There's so much information and yet somehow I feel as if I know it all already.,LEELA
4856,FRY,"Hmm, you got any sacred artwork of her from the back?",FRY
4862,FRY,Is that anything like a cemetary 'cause I gotta take a leak.  Ow!,FRY
4863,LEELA,"Fry, that's offensive to our people. Isn't it?",LEELA
4866,LEELA,"Oh no not at all. If anything, I'm more impressed.",LEELA
4867,BENDER,Ooo! I'm gonna need to make some room!,BENDER
4869,LEELA,It's all so sad. What happened to our people?,LEELA
4872,LEELA,I heard you from my room. What's wrong?,LEELA
4874,LEELA,"Please, is it bout the fate of our people? Because I'm very interested in that.",LEELA
4883,LEELA,"Alkazar, I used to be a baby, it might have been me!",LEELA
4889,LEELA,You're a male and I'm a female.,LEELA
4893,LEELA,"Uh, sure OK. What do you take with that?",LEELA
4895,LEELA,Maybe after breakfast we can talk about rebuilding our civilisation.,LEELA
4896,FRY,Mmm! Great pancakes Leela!,FRY
4902,LEELA,Look Al. I know you've been living alone a long time and I can sympathise but I'm not your maid.,LEELA
4904,LEELA,"OK OK, I'll do the dishes.  Hey where'd they go?",LEELA
4905,BENDER,"Ah, Leela's experiencing the greatest joy a woman can feel: Worshipping some lowlife jerk.",BENDER
4906,FRY,He may be some lowlife jerk but I don't trust him. I think he's hiding something and I'm gonna find out what it is.,FRY
4908,LEELA,Al? I did my hair the way you wanted it.  Who are these people?,LEELA
4910,LEELA,"Hey, where'd you get this couch and that TV set and all this stuff?",LEELA
4912,LEELA,"Too bad they weren't giving away the three things you actually need: Mouthwash, a back wax and stain-proof underwear.",LEELA
4915,LEELA,"Come on Al, can't you let the little guy out?",LEELA
4917,LEELA,Why were you sneaking into my people's forbidden valley?,LEELA
4918,FRY,"'Cause I think Alkazar's hding something. Listen Leela, you may not like it, you may not believe it, you may not wanna hear it but Alkazar's a jerk, he's bad for you. He -",FRY
4921,LEELA,Fry if it's obvious to you with your learning disability then of course it's obvious to me! He's crude and gross and he treats me like a slave.,LEELA
4922,FRY,Then dump his one eyed ass.,FRY
4923,LEELA,I can't. If I leave Alkazar then that's the end of the Cyclops race. And I won't let that happen. Even if that means a lifetime of unhappiness.,LEELA
4924,LEELA,I'll break up with him at dinner.,LEELA
4928,FRY,C'mon Leela you deserve better than this guy! Dump him already!,FRY
4938,FRY,"Pst, Leela. you've got to get me out of here. It's horrible, eating scraps, letting my waste drop wherever it falls like an animal in the zoo.",FRY
4939,LEELA,Animals go in the corner.,LEELA
4940,FRY,The corner! Why didn't I think of that?,FRY
4941,LEELA,"Look Fry I'd like to help you but it's my wedding and I'm kind of busy.  Here, try to be happy for me. That way at least one of us will be.",LEELA
4942,FRY,That's it! It's time for this bird to walk.,FRY
4943,FRY,Bender come on. We've got to get some dirt on Alkazar. Lets go and find out what makes the Forbidden Valley so forbidden.,FRY
4945,FRY,But there's probably some cool forbidden stuff you can steal.,FRY
4946,BENDER,I don't know Fry. For the first time in my life I feel like I've stolen enough.,BENDER
4947,FRY,"Bender, snap out of it!",FRY
4948,BENDER,"Sorry I don't know what came over me. Let's go.  (singing) I love stealing, I love taking things!",BENDER
4950,FRY,"Come on boy, jump!  Good boy!",FRY
4952,FRY,My God! Four identical castles!,FRY
4953,BENDER,Each more identical than the last!,BENDER
4954,FRY,"That's weird. It's another Cyclops, only this one has five eyes.",FRY
4955,BENDER,And here's another one with no eyes.,BENDER
4957,FARNSWORTH,Saving a race of one-eyed monsters? Who could object to that?,FARNSWORTH
4965,FRY,"Hey Alkazar, you left somebody off the guest list.",FRY
4968,FRY,Oh yeah? Then what about this?,FRY
4974,FRY,And maybe you'd like to meet her.  And her.,FRY
4976,LEELA,A little. That's why I've decided to hurt you until you explain it.,LEELA
4982,LEELA,But why did you have all five weddings on the same day?,LEELA
4984,LEELA,"Alright Alkazar, I just have one last question for you.",LEELA
4986,LEELA,"If you can change form, why didn't you change it in the one place that counts?",LEELA
4987,LEELA,Thanks for saving me from that creep Fry.,LEELA
4989,LEELA,"I guess I was so desperate to find out who I really was, I forgot who I really was.",LEELA
4990,FARNSWORTH,"No harm done. In the many decades you'll work to repay me for that shipment of popcorn you destroyed, you'll have plenty of time to search for your true home.",FARNSWORTH
4991,LEELA,"Yeah. I mean, how many planets can there be?",LEELA
4995,LEELA,I'm having a poker game tonight with some friends from my old cryogenics job. You guys interested?,LEELA
4996,BENDER,I don't know. I only gamble with chumps.,BENDER
5000,LEELA,"We're playing poker. but I'm warning you, my friends are serious players.",LEELA
5002,FRY,"Wow, you look happy. Is someone fired?",FRY
5004,LEELA,"Hermes, wait! We're having a poker party. Stay and whip off a batch of your famous jerk dip.",LEELA
5006,FRY,Jamaican? I thought you were some kinda outer space potato man.,FRY
5007,LEELA,Ah that must be my old boss.,LEELA
5013,LEELA,But you never wore your ring. I didn't know you had a wife.,LEELA
5015,BENDER,"C'mon, let's deal. You'll have plenty of time to talk when you're poor.",BENDER
5016,FRY,What's with the specs Bender?,FRY
5017,BENDER,They're my lucky shades. I stole them off some lucky guy while his lucky seeing eye dog was taking a whiz.,BENDER
5021,FRY,"It doesn't matter how many human females you have, Bender's on a hot streak.",FRY
5022,BENDER,"Uh, what can I say? Must be my lucky shades!  Nothing, nothing, crap, crap, garbage.  Read 'em and leak saltwater!",BENDER
5026,BENDER,If I were you I'd be more worried about that tapeworm going to town on your intestines.,BENDER
5030,BENDER,"Guys, I swear those are prescription. I need them for reading stuff - on the other side of stuff.",BENDER
5036,BENDER,"Uh, it was ghosts! Big ones! And a tornado!",BENDER
5038,FRY,Aw hey c'mon don't worry. We'll watch you clean up.,FRY
5045,FRY (WHISPERING),"Jeez Hermes, you seem awfully calm about this.",FRY
5051,LEELA (SHOUTING),Don't do it Hermes! You have so much to live for!,LEELA
5067,LEELA,Fry got his head stuck in a crater.,LEELA
5068,FRY (ASHAMED),I thought it would fit.,FRY
5070,BENDER,Martini drinking contests with the autopilot. I would've had him this time but we ran out of olives.,BENDER
5073,LEELA (QUIETLY),"What is this, high school?",LEELA
5078,BENDER (ASHAMED),"Hey, sometimes a guy gets lonely.",BENDER
5080,FRY,"Uh, I can explain that. See, it used to be milk and, well, time makes fools of us all.",FRY
5082,FRY,"Uh wait, this is the other Fry's locker. I'm Phry with a ""Ph.""",FRY
5083,FRY,What the hell's going on? I thought you were anti-dirty not pro-dirty.,FRY
5087,FRY,Just like very other girl I've dated.,FRY
5095,FARNSWORTH,That's a full time job.,FARNSWORTH
5101,LEELA,"Bender, what happened to you?",LEELA
5102,BENDER,"Morgan made me walk the Professor. There we were in the park when suddenly some old lady says I stole her purse. I chucked the Professor at her but she kept on coming. So had to hit her with this purse I found. Ah, the point is it's Morgan's fault. That pencil pushing scazwag.  Why if she were here I'd - Uh oh is she behind me?",BENDER
5108,FRY,"Uh wait, Bender's my rooommate. He could be back any second.",FRY
5110,BENDER,"Hey Fry, I made you a candle with - What the?  Oh now I see! Now I get it. Now the pieces are falling into place. The office, the promotion, that dwarf in my book club who steals my opinions.  It's all coming together now!",BENDER
5111,BENDER,I must say this opens my eyes! Another case closed my dear Watson.,BENDER
5112,FRY,"Morgan, come back! He's stuck in a loop!",FRY
5113,BENDER,For I was blind but now I see!,BENDER
5114,BENDER [FROM INSIDE],The cat's out of the bag now!,BENDER
5116,BENDER,Oh you didn't understand? Well let me explain. You......were having sex with you.,BENDER
5118,BENDER,"That's what makes it so juicy. Its the forbidden fruit angle everybody loves. First I'll say ""You'll never guess who saw Fry and Morgan doing it!"" and they'll say ""Who Bender, who?"" and I'll say ""It was lovable......old Bender.""",BENDER
5119,FRY,"Hey, what did you do to him?",FRY
5121,FRY,"But, but...Bender need brain...for...smart making!  What did you do now? Stop doing things!",FRY
5123,FRY,"No, he was a bad friend. I want him back right now.",FRY
5125,FRY,I'm sick of you and your bureaucracy.,FRY
5127,LEELA,You and Morgan were having an affair?,LEELA
5128,FRY,I couldn't help it. She loved me because of the part of me that's a slob and I loved her because of the part of me that's desperate.,FRY
5129,FRY,Poor Bender. Without his brain he's become all quiet and helpful. We've got to go to the Central Bureaucracy and get that disk back!,FRY
5133,LEELA,"Well, those arguments aside, we're still going.",LEELA
5134,FARNSWORTH,You can't just waltz into the Central Bureaucracy. It's a tangled web of red tape and regulations. I've never been but a friend of mine went completely mad trying to find the washroom there.,FARNSWORTH
5135,LEELA,Then we'll need a guide. Someone who's been there before.,LEELA
5136,FARNSWORTH,Oh I've been there. Lot's of times!,FARNSWORTH
5140,FRY,"Man, how long is this gonna take?",FRY
5142,FARNSWORTH,Well it doesn't look like I'll make it inside with the rest of you. Uh but good luck. Just leave me where I drop.,FARNSWORTH
5144,LEELA,"Come on, I have a better idea.",LEELA
5145,LEELA,Excuse me? We're from the Planet Express delivery company. We're here to deliver a robot.,LEELA
5148,LEELA,"While you're crashing, could you tell us where all these canisters end up?",LEELA
5158,LEELA,"We're getting nowhere slowly. Here, I'll address this to the Central Filing room.  Then we'll track it using my wrist-lojack-amater.",LEELA
5161,LEELA,"This is it. We'll just run in, grab Bender's disk and run out. Got it?",LEELA
5162,FRY,We'll never find that disk will we Bender?,FRY
5163,FRY,You're right. Nothing is over so long as there's one thin ray of hope.,FRY
5165,FRY,"Listen Morgan, We're through, you're an evil heartless woman and I never wanna see you again. However would you help us get Bender back for old times sake?",FRY
5168,FARNSWORTH,"Dammit Hermes, just jump already. Stop hogging that healthy liver.",FARNSWORTH
5171,LEELA,But how did you know we were here?,LEELA
5180,LEELA,That's only four minutes from now.,LEELA
5187,FARNSWORTH (SINGING),They poo-pooed my electric frankfurter.,FARNSWORTH
5188,LEELA (SINGING),They said I probably shouldn't fly with just one eye.,LEELA
5196,BENDER,"I'm Bender baby, please insert liquor!",BENDER
5203,FRY,"That's right, she fraternized me!",FRY
5208,FARNSWORTH,"Well, it looks like I'll be needing my heroic bureaucrat back. At severely reduced pay of course.",FARNSWORTH
5210,FRY,What about me? Can I come back at severely reduced pay?,FRY
5215,FARNSWORTH,"Good news everyone, the university is bringing me up on disciplinary charges! Wait, that's not good news at all.",FARNSWORTH
5216,LEELA,"Whatever you did Professor, I'm sure there's a reasonable explanation.",LEELA
5217,FARNSWORTH,"Yes but they won't listen. Everyone's always in favour of saving Hitler's brain but when you put it in the body of a great white shark (sarcastic) ooo, suddenly you've gone too far.",FARNSWORTH
5219,FARNSWORTH,"Listen to me you pompous frauds, if I'm going down, I'm taking you all with me. Dean Vernon, I know the truth. It was you driving your hover-car that night, not your horse. Dean Epsilon, I know all about your ""Department Of Pool Boy Studies."" And Dr Wernstrom...Werrrnstrom!",FARNSWORTH
5224,FARNSWORTH,"And you Coach Smalley, or should I say ""Coach hairpiece""?",FARNSWORTH
5225,LEELA,"No Professor, it's a surprise party for your 150th birthday.",LEELA
5226,FARNSWORTH,(muttering) Hundred and...what? Oooh!,FARNSWORTH
5227,BENDER,"Good evening I'm -  Whoa, sorry. I'm Bender and I'll be MC-ing this roast. Y'know, they say you can judge a man by the company he keeps, so here's the Professor's oldest friend: A grotesque, stinking lobster!",BENDER
5229,BENDER,"Where would the Professor be without students who love and respect him? Right there!  But seriously, of all the former crew members of the Professor's delivery ship, our next speaker is by far the most alive. Captain Muskie?",BENDER
5231,BENDER,"And now, a man who needs no introduction. (whispering) Fry, get up there!",BENDER
5232,FRY,"Oh.  Thank you. Y'know, when I was first asked to make a film about my nephew, Professor Farnsworth, I thought ""Why should I?"" Then later Leela made the film. But if I had made the film, you could bet there would have been a lot more topless women on motorcycles! Roll film!",FRY
5233,FRY,(whispering) Dork alert!,FRY
5234,BENDER,How 'bout a few words Professor?,BENDER
5237,FARNSWORTH,"Uh, what a pleasure it is to see my lifetime of accomplishments summed up in a 3-minute film. My best years are behind me. So much left undone. So little time.",FARNSWORTH
5240,LEELA,No it isn't. You have another 10 years left.,LEELA
5241,FRY,Leela! He could live another 100 years!,FRY
5242,LEELA,"No, he couldn't. When you turn 160, robots from the Sunset Squad take you to a mysterious planet and you never return.",LEELA
5243,FRY,"Wow, a whole planet of old people. Where is it?",FRY
5244,BENDER,(spookily) Nobody knows!,BENDER
5245,FARNSWORTH,So many loves half-loved. So many inventions half-invented. That damn time machine alone set me back 15 years.,FARNSWORTH
5247,FARNSWORTH,"There's no one to carry on after I'm gone. No one to take care of my work and my research and my fabulous fortune. By God, that's it! I've got to name a successor.",FARNSWORTH
5250,FARNSWORTH,There's no time to lose. I'm off to my lab to build a successor-naming machine!,FARNSWORTH
5251,FRY,"Man, the Professor's been in his lab for days.",FRY
5252,BENDER,I hope he didn't die. Unless he left a note naming me his successor. Then I hope he did die.,BENDER
5257,LEELA,"Look, the Professor trusts me with a giant spaceship. He wouldn't trust the rest of you with his dentures.",LEELA
5259,FRY,Sorry everyone but need I remind you? Blood is thicker than water.,FRY
5261,FARNSWORTH,"Everyone, I have a very dramatic announcement. So anyone with a weak heart should leave now. Goodbye.",FARNSWORTH
5263,FARNSWORTH,"Oh yes, the announcement! As you all know, I am not long for this world...",FARNSWORTH
5268,FARNSWORTH,...So I've picked my successor. It's someone in whom I have great faith - even though his mind is undeveloped and he's accomplished nothing.  My closest living relative...,FARNSWORTH
5270,FARNSWORTH,"My clone, Cubert Farnsworth.",FARNSWORTH
5272,FRY,Crud. Can I at least be in charge of your dentures?,FRY
5274,FRY,Where did Cubert come from?,FRY
5275,FARNSWORTH,12 years ago I began the cloning process by removing some skin cells from one of the shaplier growths on my back.,FARNSWORTH
5276,LEELA,"Wait, if he's your clone then why doesn't his nose look like yours?",LEELA
5277,FARNSWORTH,I left him in his first tube too long and he got squished up against the side.,FARNSWORTH
5278,BENDER,Is he dumb or just ugly?,BENDER
5283,FRY,"Well, once in the park.",FRY
5288,BENDER,Uh...me no speaka the English.,BENDER
5292,BENDER,Im pending para un bending!,BENDER
5293,FARNSWORTH,"Oh Cubert, come in here. I have something amazing to show you.",FARNSWORTH
5297,FARNSWORTH,As my successor I'm trusting you to carry on my work. These are just some of the half finished inventions you'll spend your life finishing.,FARNSWORTH
5299,FARNSWORTH,"That's my prizewinning smelloscope. If a dog craps anywhere in the universe, you can bet I won't be out of the loop. And this is my universal translator. Unfortunately so far it only translates into an incomprehensible dead language.",FARNSWORTH
5304,FARNSWORTH,Why certainly. Step over here.,FARNSWORTH
5305,FARNSWORTH,These are the dark matter engine I invented. They allow my starship to travel between galaxies in mere hours.,FARNSWORTH
5307,FARNSWORTH,Of course not. That's why scientists increased the speed of light in 2208.,FARNSWORTH
5309,FARNSWORTH,And what makes my engines truly remarkable is the afterburner which delivers 200% fuel efficiency.,FARNSWORTH
5311,FARNSWORTH,Not at all. It's very simple.,FARNSWORTH
5313,FARNSWORTH,Now that's impossible. It came to me in a dream and I forgot it in another dream.,FARNSWORTH
5315,FARNSWORTH,Nothing is impossible. Not if you can imagine it. That's what being is a scientist is all about.,FARNSWORTH
5317,BENDER,"Oh my God, oh my God! It's Elzar, the TV chef! Oh kill me now people!",BENDER
5319,BENDER,"Oh Elzar, everything's so good!",BENDER
5322,FARNSWORTH,Oh it's a gem of an evening! I feel so wonderful having someone to take over my life work! And it's all thanks to Cubert.,FARNSWORTH
5326,FARNSWORTH,But-But what about my hopes and my dreams and my wonderful inventions?,FARNSWORTH
5331,FARNSWORTH,"Bad news everyone. By the time you watch this tape, I'll be gone. Leaving by nothing but a history of failure and my original hipbones. You see, I've been lying about my age. I'm not actually 150. I'm 160. Oh vanity, thy name is Professor Farnsworth. And now that I've nothing to live for, I've alerted the Sunset Squad robots to take me away.",FARNSWORTH
5332,FARNSWORTH,"Goodbye cruel world.  Goodbye cruel lamp.  Goodbye cruel velvet drapes, lined with what would appear to be some sort of cruel muslin......and the cute little pompom curtain pull cords, cruel though they may be a -",FARNSWORTH
5338,BENDER,"(unmoved) Well, life goes on. Except for you!",BENDER
5341,FRY,We've gotta get him back.,FRY
5343,FRY,"Nothing is impossible. You'd know that if you really took after the Professor, like I do.",FRY
5347,LEELA,Quiet. I think I know how to find the Professor.,LEELA
5348,BENDER,Lay it on us big boots.,BENDER
5349,LEELA,"If the smelloscope can pick up the Professor's odour, we may have a chance to save him.",LEELA
5351,LEELA,I'm zeroing in on him.  Bengay...mothballs......letters to the editor. It's the Professor!,LEELA
5353,FRY,"To the left!  No to the up!  U-turn, U-turn!",FRY
5355,BENDER,No we're not you little bed wetter. Oops I'm sorry.,BENDER
5356,LEELA,There it is! The Near-Death Star!,LEELA
5357,LEELA,"OK, we'll tell them the Professor escaped and we're bringing him back. Fry, you'll have to dress up like a 160 year old man.",LEELA
5360,LEELA,Now they may ask for a DNA sample.,LEELA
5361,FRY,I'd like to see them find it!,FRY
5363,BENDER,I think I know where to get some.,BENDER
5365,FRY,'Cause you're too ugly to be a wart.,FRY
5366,LEELA,Your medicare dollars at work.,LEELA
5368,LEELA,"Uh, this is Professor Hubert Farnsworth. He escaped.",LEELA
5371,FRY,"What? I'm old. Listen. (old man voice) Hey you kids, get off the lawn!",FRY
5374,BENDER,Got a hot steaming batch right here!,BENDER
5376,BENDER,"Eh, keep the change buddy.",BENDER
5379,FRY,Uh....I-I've got talking hump syndrome.,FRY
5385,FRY,So this is where they stick old people. It's horrific.,FRY
5386,LEELA,At least it keeps them from driving.,LEELA
5387,LEELA,Brace yourself for the worst.,LEELA
5388,BENDER,And yet he looks so natural.,BENDER
5390,LEELA,"He's hooked up to a life-support system. We have to disconnect him very very carefully, or the shock could kill him.",LEELA
5398,LEELA,"We're probably going to make it, but we might not.",LEELA
5402,FRY,"Come on Leela, step your big boot down on the gas pedal.",FRY
5403,LEELA,They've blown out one of our engines!,LEELA
5404,FRY,Fix it fix it fix it fix it fix it fix it! Fix it fix it fix it!,FRY
5405,LEELA,Only the Professor knows how to fix it. We have to wake him up.,LEELA
5407,BENDER,(shouting) Your social security cheque is late! Stuff costs more than it used to. Young people use curse words!,BENDER
5408,FRY,"Damnit, we'll have to fix the engine ourself.",FRY
5409,LEELA,"We can't you bastard, no one knows how it works. It's impossible.",LEELA
5411,BENDER,That's a complete load.,BENDER
5419,FARNSWORTH,I'm as spry as a 140 year old.  See? I only broke one ankle.,FARNSWORTH
5420,FRY,So what were they doing to you in that awful drawer?,FRY
5421,FARNSWORTH,"Oh, they had me hooked up to a bizarre virtual world that seemed absolutely real.",FARNSWORTH
5423,FARNSWORTH,"It was as though I was living in a facility in Florida with hundreds of other old people. All day long we'd play bingo, eat oatmeal and wait for our children to call.",FARNSWORTH
5424,LEELA,It's a hundred times more horrible than anything I could imagine.,LEELA
5425,FARNSWORTH,"Oh my yes. Thank you all for saving me. Especially you my little clone. No matter what you decide to do with your life, I'm still proud of you.",FARNSWORTH
5427,FARNSWORTH,"Don't worry son. You will. Incidentally, you might want to read up on a condition known as ""wandering bladder.""",FARNSWORTH
5429,FARNSWORTH,No reason. No reason at all.,FARNSWORTH
5433,LEELA,"Hermes, that's sweet. I didn't know you cared about Nibbler.",LEELA
5435,FARNSWORTH,Ah! The exact centre of the Atlantic Ocean. This seems the logical place for fish to congregate.,FARNSWORTH
5436,BENDER,So we're in international waters?,BENDER
5438,BENDER,"Falcon, this is Blue Raven, the goose has nested. Repeat, the goose has nested. Hey, guess what you're accessories to?",BENDER
5439,LEELA,"The sun, the sea air, good friends.",LEELA
5440,BENDER,"Leela's right, fishing blows. Whattya say we make it interesting?",BENDER
5444,BENDER,"Everybody kick in five bucks.  There, wasn't that interesting?",BENDER
5446,FRY,This contest is as good as over. I once caught a fish this big.,FRY
5447,BENDER,"Oh, yeah? I once caught a fish this big!",BENDER
5448,LEELA,"I'm afraid you're both out of your league, boys, 'cause you're looking at a woman who owns her own harpoon.",LEELA
5454,BENDER,"Hey, Fry, check out my laser-guided fishing rod.",BENDER
5455,FRY,"(whispering) Quiet, Bender, you're scaring away the fish.",FRY
5456,BENDER,Fine. I'll head over to the other side. (shouting) Good luck fishing on this side!,BENDER
5457,FRY,I can hit a fish between the eyes from 20 yards!,FRY
5458,BENDER,"Oh, yeah? I can hit a shrimp!",BENDER
5459,FRY,A shrimp?  I find it a bit hard to believe that--,FRY
5460,LEELA,"Aha!  Gather round, chumps! I got the winner!",LEELA
5462,BENDER,Couple more of those and you'll have yourself a fish stick!,BENDER
5463,FRY,"Hey, a fish this fine belongs in a fish nugget-style chunklet. And anyway, it's bigger than anything you've caught. Ow! My small intestine!",FRY
5464,LEELA,"Bingo! Whatever it is, it's 20 times heavier than a boot.",LEELA
5465,FARNSWORTH,You'll never catch anything with that primitive technology. What you need is this fish pheromone.  The most potent aphrodisiac known to fishkind.  Uh-oh!,FARNSWORTH
5468,FRY,"(shouting) Hey, Bender, I just caught a fish this big!",FRY
5469,BENDER,"Quit exaggerating, Fry. Ah, screw this! If I'm not gonna catch a fish, I might as well not catch a big fish.  There. Like most of life's problems this one can be solved with bending.",BENDER
5470,FARNSWORTH,"Bender, be careful. That's the ships diamond filament tether. It's unbreakable.",FARNSWORTH
5471,BENDER,Then why do I have to be careful?,BENDER
5472,FARNSWORTH,It belonged to my grandmother.,FARNSWORTH
5474,LEELA,"Wake up, everyone! I've got something. And this time it's alive!  Dr. Zoidberg, since when do you even wear boots?",LEELA
5476,LEELA,"Come on, let's go home.",LEELA
5478,BENDER,I don't know. It wasn't here when I took your umbrella.  What? I put sunblock on you.,BENDER
5480,LEELA,"Come on, Bender. Pull in your line and let's go.",LEELA
5482,FARNSWORTH,"It's not snagged, the mechano man has caught something!  Sweet Zombie Jesus! It's huge!",FARNSWORTH
5487,LEELA,It's pulling us under! Everyone into the ship!,LEELA
5490,LEELA,"Depth at 45 hundred feet, 48 hundred, 50 hundred! 5000 feet!",LEELA
5491,FARNSWORTH,"Dear Lord, that's over 150 atmospheres of pressure.",FARNSWORTH
5492,FRY,How many atmospheres can this ship withstand?,FRY
5493,FARNSWORTH,"Well it's a spaceship, so I'd say anywhere between zero and one.",FARNSWORTH
5494,BENDER,What's that? Is someone bending girders?,BENDER
5495,LEELA,We'll be crushed if we don't equalise the pressure.,LEELA
5499,FRY,"Wait, I'll be back in a minute.",FRY
5502,BENDER,"People, it's far far worse than we thought; My fish got away.",BENDER
5503,LEELA,"There, good as new! Except we're three miles below the surface, we don't have any food and the ship won't work underwater.",LEELA
5504,BENDER,(restrained) Tempers are wearing thin. Let's just hope some robot doesn't kill everybody.,BENDER
5506,LEELA,"OK, everyone, calm down. The Professor and I will get to work on the ship. Bender, Zoidberg, since you can survive underwater, you'll go out and look for food.",LEELA
5507,FRY,I'd better go too. They don't know what I like.,FRY
5509,FARNSWORTH,Not necessarily. This is chance for Fry to test out my experimental anti-pressure pill.,FARNSWORTH
5511,FARNSWORTH,Well then good news! It's a suppository.,FARNSWORTH
5516,BENDER,"Ahoy, mateys! I shanghaied us some hearty grub.  Arr! The laws o' science be a harsh mistress!",BENDER
5518,BENDER,"Uh, OK, but I'm not carrying it upstairs.",BENDER
5521,BENDER,You want some lemonade? You saw a big parade?,BENDER
5523,LEELA,"Fry, swallow your food. Then talk.",LEELA
5526,FRY,"No, I did see a mermaid! She was wearing a tube top and she had a beautiful scaley tail. And I think she had hair extensions.",FRY
5530,FARNSWORTH,"You're simply hallucinating, you ... moron.",FARNSWORTH
5531,FRY,"What's so far-fetched about mermaids? I mean, there's all sorts of weird sea creatures here in the future. Like Dr. Zoidberg.",FRY
5532,LEELA,I'm afraid Fry is suffering from ocean madness.,LEELA
5533,FRY,"Every time something good happens to me you say it's some kind of madness, or I'm drunk, or I ate too much candy. Well I saw a real mermaid and I wish for once my friends would have decency and kindness to believe me.",FRY
5534,LEELA,(whispering) Ocean madness.,LEELA
5535,FARNSWORTH,He may have ocean madness but that's no excuse for ocean rudeness.,FARNSWORTH
5536,FRY,"(muttering) Ocean madness, yeah right. It's always something, ain't it?  (talking) It's her! Bender, wake up! She's here! Wake up!  Oh! oxygen!",FRY
5538,FRY,"Hey! I can breath and talk, just like a fish!",FRY
5542,FRY,"I'm Fry. So, uh, am I gonna drown?",FRY
5546,FRY,I can't believe you're really real. I like your tail.,FRY
5548,FRY,"Oh, Thanks. They're called pants.",FRY
5552,FRY,"Sure, sometimes it falls from the sky.",FRY
5554,FRY,And sometimes it doesn't.,FRY
5556,FRY,"You know what I like best about you, Umbriel? You find me fascinating even when I'm not claiming to be a jewel thief or a lion tamer.",FRY
5558,FRY,Yup. We call them land-sealions ... I tame them!,FRY
5559,FARNSWORTH,I'm almost finish reconfiguring the ships propulsion system. We can leave as soon as the paper-mâché is dry.,FARNSWORTH
5561,BENDER,I didn't kill him. Professor?,BENDER
5564,LEELA,"It's ocean madness alright. Sailors call it aqua dementia, the deep down crazies, the wet willies, the screaming moist!",LEELA
5565,FARNSWORTH,"We'll form a search party. Now, we'll need oxygen.",FARNSWORTH
5566,BENDER,"I got it covered.  In the event of an emergency, my ass can be used as a floatation device.",BENDER
5567,FARNSWORTH,"Ooh, that reminds me: You've all taken your pressure pills, right?",FARNSWORTH
5572,FARNSWORTH,Could it possibly be? Are the old legends true?  It is! It's the fabled lost city of Atlanta!,FARNSWORTH
5575,FARNSWORTH,"This is uncomfortable and humiliating. Now, if they could put it in the form of a suppository.",FARNSWORTH
5577,BENDER,"Fry! Oh, I just knew you were still alive! (whispering) I owe you 10 bucks, Hermes!",BENDER
5578,FRY,"Hey, you guys, the most amazing thing happened. It's two-for-one Tuesday at Krispy Kreme! Plus there's mermaids.",FRY
5581,FRY,I think it was just an airport. They had a place where you could buy nuts.,FRY
5583,FRY,"That's right, honey! Whatever you say.",FRY
5585,LEELA,"But tell us: How could a city with such a ... fabulous airport, end up underwater?",LEELA
5590,BENDER,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wouldn't it take millions of years to evolve into mermaids?",BENDER
5595,FARNSWORTH,"Yes, we all miss our loved ones and gases. Come on, Fry.",FARNSWORTH
5596,FRY,Wait. I'm not going with you.,FRY
5597,LEELA,"But, Fry, what about us? What about your life on the surface? You don't belong down here.",LEELA
5599,FARNSWORTH,"Fry, you half-mad, half-insane maniac, be reasonable. Don't you realise that if you stay at this depth your body will permanently adapt to the pressure?",FARNSWORTH
5600,FRY,Realise it? I don't even understand it!,FRY
5601,FARNSWORTH,It means you'll never be able to return to the surface.,FARNSWORTH
5602,FRY,I don't care. I'm staying. I've got everything I want right here.,FRY
5603,FARNSWORTH,(shouting) I'm bored! Let's go!,FARNSWORTH
5605,FRY,"Sorry, Zoidberg. I'm trying to join the country club.",FRY
5606,BENDER,"(crying) Oh, Fry!  I'll miss you!",BENDER
5608,FARNSWORTH,"(shouting) Let's go, damnit! Let's go!",FARNSWORTH
5615,BENDER,So that's where I left my cigar.,BENDER
5617,FRY,"You know, Umbriel, these last 24 hours have been the happiest days of my life.",FRY
5619,FRY,Mercy! I do believe I'm gettin' the vapours!,FRY
5621,FRY,Yeah I'm a little confused too. How do I ... y'know ... with the tail and all?,FRY
5623,FRY,"(gasping) Why couldn't she be the other type of mermaid, with the fish part on top and the lady part on the bottom?",FRY
5626,FARNSWORTH,There! The engine modifications are complete.,FARNSWORTH
5628,FRY,Wait! Wait for me! Don't leave me here!,FRY
5633,LEELA,"Fry, are you alright? What happened?",LEELA
5635,FRY,"Well, it turns out I loved her, but I wasn't in love with her.",FRY
5637,BENDER,"Ah, it's great to have you back, buddy.",BENDER
5639,FRY,"Ow! Bender, you're hurting me. Ow!",FRY
5644,BENDER,"Wow! I'm finally gonna see my favourite chef, TV's Elzar. Oh this is the greatest nanosecond of my life. No, this one is - no, this one. Wait...that one was slightly worse. Ah, so far so good on this one.",BENDER
5645,BENDER,Yeah!  Alright! Yeah baby!,BENDER
5647,BENDER,"Elzar, you're my god. Please sign this sketch I drew of you.",BENDER
5649,BENDER,"(disappointed) Oh.  (normal) Alright, yeah!  (quietly) Alright, yeah!",BENDER
5651,BENDER,(loudly) Boiled? Interesting.,BENDER
5652,LEELA,"(whispering) Bender, please try to be a little quieter.",LEELA
5655,BENDER,"Oh yeah, bam it again Elzar. Knock it up another notch!",BENDER
5657,BENDER,Come on you wimp. Work that weasel. Quit holding out on us.,BENDER
5659,BENDER,"I gotta get this notch-up knocking on film.  Hey Elzar, think fast.",BENDER
5675,LEELA,A week? What do you think Dr Zoidberg?,LEELA
5679,LEELA,I'm not deaf. I just have to wear this stupid eye patch. Does it look stupid?,LEELA
5680,FRY,"No. In fact, it looks so nice I think I might get one too.",FRY
5681,BENDER,It's Elzar again! Oh my God I'm so excited I wish I could wet my pants.,BENDER
5685,BENDER,(cheering) Hooray for blindy!,BENDER
5692,BENDER,"Oh Fry, you gotta try this sterno-nicoise!",BENDER
5693,FRY,No thanks. That's robot food.,FRY
5694,BENDER,It's so good. Oh just try a little!,BENDER
5695,FRY,No really I don't -  Mmm!,FRY
5697,LEELA,"Oh yeah, this salad's fantastic.  So fresh.",LEELA
5698,FARNSWORTH,Oh my. That steamed carrot was a bit spicy for me.,FARNSWORTH
5708,LEELA,You're charging us? After you blinded me?,LEELA
5717,FRY,"No, I was just picking my nose.",FRY
5722,BENDER,Hey wait a second. I've got the perfect solution.,BENDER
5724,BENDER,I love cooking and Elzar's ass likes getting kissed right?,BENDER
5726,BENDER,"So, how 'bout I work part time at the restaurant to pay off our debt?",BENDER
5737,BENDER,That'll be easy. I never wear the damn thing.,BENDER
5739,LEELA,I'm here and I'm getting along just fine thank you. My walk to work today just took a little longer than usual. Nibbler took me through the zoo for some reason.,LEELA
5741,LEELA,I don't need help. For you information I did this all by myself.,LEELA
5742,FARNSWORTH,"You look beautiful. Incidentally, my favourite artist is Picasso.",FARNSWORTH
5743,BENDER,"Well, I'm off to work at the restaurant. One of you will have to fill in for me while I'm gone.",BENDER
5744,FARNSWORTH,"Better yet, I'll build someone to fill in for you.  Some kind of gamma powered mechanical monster, with freeway on-ramps for arms and a heart as black as coal...",FARNSWORTH
5745,BENDER,"Well, if that new give can't handle thing, gimmie a call.",BENDER
5746,BENDER,"I'm done siphoning out the grease trap. I think I need a mint.  So uh, what job do I move up to? Pastry chef? Saucier? Soup guy?",BENDER
5748,BENDER,"(muttering) Bam yourself!  (talking) Hey, who are they?",BENDER
5750,BENDER,Are they the robot mafia?,BENDER
5756,BENDER,"Uh, let me bus that for you gentlemen. No, what I meant to do was...",BENDER
5759,BENDER,Mind your own business and get out!,BENDER
5763,BENDER,No you gave me a fifty.,BENDER
5767,BENDER,I'm tryin' but he's not makin' it easy.,BENDER
5773,BENDER,"Are you kidding? I've always wanted to break into gooning!  (shouting) Hey Elzar, I quit.",BENDER
5775,BENDER,"Wow, you guys run numbers?!",BENDER
5778,BENDER,That's just what my mom used to tell me.,BENDER
5779,BENDER,That's some fine oil-ade son. We could use a man like you in the Robot Mafia which I'm sorta in.,BENDER
5787,BENDER,What seems to be the problem officers? Was I speeding?,BENDER
5794,BENDER,"Uh, I'd rather plan some fellonies.",BENDER
5804,BENDER,"How 'bout ""Blotto""? It's witty, it's got street cred. Plus I can keep my monogrammed slippers.",BENDER
5808,BENDER,It's funny. Until now I always wanted to be a gangster...so the answer's yes.,BENDER
5813,FRY,But we're about to take off. We gotta eat our blastoff sundaes.,FRY
5814,FRY [FROM OUTSIDE],OK you stay in bed. I'll eat yours.,FRY
5815,FRY,Bender's sick.  Need any help taking off?,FRY
5816,LEELA,I'm fine thank you. A real pilot can navigate by feel alone.,LEELA
5818,BENDER,You know the secret of traditional robot cooking? Start with a good high-quality oil...then eat it. So whats this big score anyway?,BENDER
5820,BENDER,Zubans? Those are the finest cigars in the universe. I can stink up a hole maternity ward with one of those things.,BENDER
5823,BENDER,And all without killing anyone.  This gang's got some fresh new ideas. I admire that.,BENDER
5826,FRY,"Wow, it's too bad you can't see Leela 'cause theres a cool ship out there shooting at somebody.",FRY
5827,LEELA,I'm taking evasive action.,LEELA
5829,LEELA,"Stop bothering me Fry, I need full concentration.",LEELA
5831,LEELA,Eyesight is for chumps.,LEELA
5833,BENDER,"Um, uh, um.  (fake hurt) Ooh ow! He got me! Ow, what a shot that guy is.",BENDER
5834,LEELA,"Wait. Why do the raised letters that normally say ""Turnmaster Steering company"" say ""Nibbler""? Oh no!",LEELA
5835,LEELA [ON SCREEN],I'm back at the wheel Fry. Everything's under control.,LEELA
5836,FRY,"Great, great. The one time I forgot to buy flight insurance.",FRY
5839,LEELA,The engine's stalled. I'm trying the manual fuel pump.,LEELA
5841,LEELA,You'll never get away with this.,LEELA
5842,FRY,Unless you let us live. Then you'll get off scot free.,FRY
5845,LEELA,"I'll assume that's a joke at my expense. Well, who's laughing now? Heyya!",LEELA
5847,BENDER,"Sorry I'm tardy old bean, I was just enjoying a rather tasty watercress sandwich.",BENDER
5849,BENDER,"Capital idea old sport.  I say, get the hell off me!",BENDER
5850,LEELA,(whispering) That guy sounds familiar.,LEELA
5851,BENDER,"My word, what have we -  Uh, nothing to see here old girl.",BENDER
5856,BENDER,"Uh wait, old...spice. Let me have a go at this mechanised chap. I can be quite the rough customer.",BENDER
5857,FRY,"(whispering) Oh no, poor Bender.",FRY
5858,BENDER,(fake voice) ...Take that you twit. (normal voice) No! Stop it!,BENDER
5860,BENDER,"Uh, hey Donny, baby, gimmie a chance here huh? Yous guys skidaddle. Let me take care of the doity woik.",BENDER
5864,FRY,"Leela, we may not have much time left......so let's spend all of it reminscing about Bender. He was like a big computer than ran on magic.",FRY
5868,BENDER,Yes I am. Having just this minute regained consciousness.,BENDER
5869,LEELA,"I've got an idea. Hold still.  It's about to break, yes, yes!",LEELA
5872,FRY,"I'm telling you, Leela was cool, she was in command, and when she kicked people it hurt. It really hurt.",FRY
5873,LEELA,"Well, this is the big moment. It's finally time to take my patch off.",LEELA
5875,LEELA,I think it's Blotto. That gangster I saw when my patch fell off.  Professor? Where were you at 10pm last night?,LEELA
5877,BENDER,So they sent a helpless child to kill me? Well I'm not going out without a fight.,BENDER
5879,BENDER,"Oh sweet legal tender!  Kid, tell the Donbot I'm quitting organised crime. From now on I'll stick to regular kind.",BENDER
5880,FRY,It's funny Bender. With you sick and Leela blind only I know what really went on out there. Maybe someday I'll tell you the whole story.,FRY
5881,BENDER,And maybe someday I won't listen.,BENDER
5886,FRY,"I hate the Planet of the Moochers. They take you out for a drink, but when the check comes, their wallet's always in their other pants - which they borrowed from me!",FRY
5888,BENDER,"Nah, those lousy Moochers cleaned out our pantry. All they left was baking soda and capers. And here it is!",BENDER
5890,LEELA,Ugh! Great. We're two days from Earth with no food.,LEELA
5891,BENDER,Problem solved: You two fight to the death and I'll cook the loser. (whispering to Leela) Work his gut; I like it tender.,BENDER
5892,FRY,Maybe that planet over there has a drive-thru. A Burger Jerk or a Fishy Joe's or a Chizzler or something.,FRY
5893,BENDER,"Ah, don't get your hopes up. We're a billion miles from nowhere.",BENDER
5894,LEELA,Yeah. It's probably only got a Howard Johnson's.,LEELA
5895,LEELA,"Well, it's a type-M planet, so it should at least have Roddenberries.",LEELA
5896,FRY,I'm experienced at foraging. I used to find edible mushrooms on my bath mat.,FRY
5897,BENDER,"I found some rocks. You guys eat rocks, right?",BENDER
5899,BENDER,(tempting) Not even if they're sautéed in a little mud?,BENDER
5900,FRY,Here's something. It looks like a ditch full of fried shrimp.,FRY
5901,BENDER,"What are you, blind? It looks more like a hole full of fried prawns.",BENDER
5902,LEELA,Hm. This thing I wear on my wrist says they're not poisonous.,LEELA
5903,FRY,"Well? How are they?  Oh, they're great! They're like sex! Except I'm having them!",FRY
5904,BENDER,You know what these would go great with? Rocks.,BENDER
5906,BENDER,The planet's covered with 'em.,BENDER
5907,FRY,Let's bring back a couple of pocketfuls.,FRY
5908,BENDER,"No, a whole Bender-ful!",BENDER
5909,LEELA,No. Only what we need. Stuff the ship.,LEELA
5914,LEELA,We haven't thought of a name yet.,LEELA
5915,BENDER,"They're tasty, right? Let's call 'em ""Tasty-cles"".",BENDER
5918,LEELA,We can't call them that.,LEELA
5920,LEELA,"It sounds too much like those frozen rocky mountain oysters on a stick. You know, Test-cicles?",LEELA
5922,FRY,"I know, we'll call them Popplers!",FRY
5928,BENDER,"Whoa, whoa, slow down there, Sigmund. I can't stand idly by while poor people get free food. We gotta sell these things!",BENDER
5932,FRY,"Hey, business is great.",FRY
5933,BENDER,"Ah, great is OK, but amazing would be great.",BENDER
5935,BENDER,"Hey, Mac, where do you want those rat droppings you ordered?",BENDER
5941,FRY,Wow! You're some guy who eats at Fishy Joe's?,FRY
5943,BENDER,"Hey, Fishy. I've been meaning to write you about your in-store kiddie parks. The slides won't support an adult robot.",BENDER
5947,BENDER,Yes! I'm gonna be rich.  You too but it's hard to get excited about that.,BENDER
5949,FRY AND BENDER,(singing) Pop a Poppler in your mouth,FRY
5952,FRY,Leela! That's the second billboard you've crashed into this week!,FRY
5953,LEELA,Sorry. I was distracted by those protesters outside our building.,LEELA
5956,FARNSWORTH,"(shouting) Hey! Unless this is a nude love-in, get the hell off my property!",FARNSWORTH
5958,FARNSWORTH,"I can, but that's because I'm not a penniless hippie.",FARNSWORTH
5959,LEELA,(shouting) What do you people want?,LEELA
5963,LEELA,"You're vegetarians, who cares what you do?",LEELA
5965,LEELA,Animals eat other animals. It's nature.,LEELA
5967,BENDER,"(shouting) OK, we won't eat you.",BENDER
5968,LEELA,I'll go get some more bricks.,LEELA
5969,LEELA,"Fry, I wish you'd throw out these week-old Popplers. They're getting big and scaly. Ooh, there's one left.",LEELA
5971,LEELA,Stop! Stop eating Popplers!,LEELA
5974,LEELA,Popplers are intelligent. This one called me mama.,LEELA
5976,BENDER,"Popplers can't talk. Leela must be hallucinating from not eating enough Popplers. Here, eat some now.",BENDER
5978,BENDER,"I said ""eat""! Come on, mange!",BENDER
5982,LEELA,"I'm telling you, it spoke to me. Come on, little Poppler, say ""mama"".",LEELA
5983,FRY,"Look, Leela, even if you heard one talk, that doesn't mean it's intelligent. I mean, parrots talk and we eat them, right?",FRY
5984,BENDER,Yeah. Maybe it just learned to talk as a parlour trick. Like Fry.,BENDER
5986,FARNSWORTH,"There's one way, and only one way, to determine if an animal is intelligent. Dissect its brain!",FARNSWORTH
5988,FARNSWORTH,Enough chit-chat. Restrain the specimen!,FARNSWORTH
5991,LEELA,(shouting) Stop eating Popplers! They can talk!,LEELA
5995,FRY,"People, I won't let you enter. Popplers are as intelligent as you or me.",FRY
5997,BENDER,"Hear me, hear me! Stop eating Popplers! Stop eating them with honey mustard sauce......stop eating them with tangy sweet and sour sauce. Stop eating the new fiesta Poppler salad. Stop taking advantage of the money-saving 12-pack. Stop enjoying Popplers on the patio, in the car, or on the boat. Wherever good times are had!  Ow!",BENDER
6016,LEELA,That's not true. I have one right here that can talk.,LEELA
6021,LEELA,"Look, I'm saying eating meat is wrong...",LEELA
6023,LEELA,I don't think anyone's here to make that claim.,LEELA
6025,LEELA,But eating an intelligent animal is different.,LEELA
6039,FARNSWORTH,"Dear Lord, they're back!",FARNSWORTH
6061,FRY,I wish they'd just wipe out humanity and get it over with. It's the waiting I can't stand.,FRY
6072,BENDER,"I'll miss you, Leela.  I know you're just a carbon-based life form but I'll always think of you as a big pile of titanium.",BENDER
6073,FRY,"What Bender means is, you're really brave, and smart, and beautiful, and a great friend.",FRY
6074,BENDER,(crying) Just like titanium!,BENDER
6075,LEELA,This is all a big load. I was the one trying to save the Popplers.  You were sucking them down like the fat hog you are and you were stepping on them for fun.  You both should be in here instead of me.,LEELA
6076,BENDER,(whispering to Fry) Someone's acting awfully aluminum.,BENDER
6078,LEELA,"Oh, great, Captain Moron has a plan. Why don't you tell it to Wingus and Dingus here?",LEELA
6082,LEELA,It doesn't look anything like me. The hair is all wrong.,LEELA
6084,LEELA,"You know, this might actually work. The Omicronians seem to have trouble telling one person from another.",LEELA
6114,LEELA,Go consummate yourself.,LEELA
6116,LEELA,Please! I just paid off my car!,LEELA
6125,LEELA,"(mumbling) Yeah, it is.",LEELA
6132,LEELA,"Thank you, Jrrr.  I hope you'll always think of me as your mom.",LEELA
6139,FARNSWORTH,A toast to Leela. She showed us it's wrong to eat certain things.,FARNSWORTH
6142,LEELA,"Aww, thanks, guys. Pass the veal, please.",LEELA
6144,FRY,"Mmm, let me get some of that suckling pig.",FRY
6146,LEELA,Dolphin? But dolphins are intelligent.,LEELA
6147,BENDER,Not this one. He blew all his money on instant lottery tickets.,BENDER
6155,FARNSWORTH,Toss me the speech centre of the brain!,FARNSWORTH
6163,BENDER,"Come look, everyone. I just got the dearest presents for Mommy.",BENDER
6164,LEELA,Very nice. Where'd you steal them?,LEELA
6165,BENDER,"I didn't steal 'em, I bought 'em.  I love her that much.",BENDER
6167,BENDER,"Oh, precious things. I found the most adorable little figurine of mice having tea.  And a framed picture of me when I was only a month old.  But, the best part is, I found my exact feelings expressed in a greeting card.",BENDER
6169,LEELA,So how are you gonna lug all those gifts to Mom's factory?,LEELA
6170,BENDER,I'll get a couple of chumps to help me.,BENDER
6171,BENDER,"Come on, you call yourselves chumps?",BENDER
6172,FRY,"Man, there's clouds of exhaust everywhere.",FRY
6177,BENDER,"Hey, look, the Robot Museum! You guys wanna learn about robot heritage?",BENDER
6180,BENDER,"Well, if you insist. But you're paying!",BENDER
6181,BENDER,"Ooh, ooh, wax replicas of the most famous robots Mom ever built!",BENDER
6182,LEELA,They're so lifeless-like.,LEELA
6183,BENDER,"That's the world's greatest robot artist, Vincent van Gobot. He was built without an ear, but then he went crazy and had one installed.",BENDER
6186,FRY,"I'm sorry, I-I thought you were made of wax.",FRY
6188,FRY,"I mean, I thought you were one of the wax robots.",FRY
6190,LEELA,(reading) See through the eyes of a bender unit. (talking) Fine.,LEELA
6191,BENDER,"Hey, let me try.  Whoa, that gives me a headache!",BENDER
6192,FRY,"Hey, Bender. Here's an exhibit about Mom's favourite robot.",FRY
6193,BENDER,"Who is he, I'll kill him!",BENDER
6195,BENDER,It's me! No one else look in this mirror!,BENDER
6210,LEELA,"Well, see you back at the office. And don't forget to tell your mom you love her.",LEELA
6211,BENDER,Any jerk can tell her! Bender has a little more up his sleeve.,BENDER
6216,BENDER,"Mom! It's me, Bender. Look at me! I want attention. Hey ho!",BENDER
6227,FRY,"Yeah, uh, I'd like a cup of coffee, please.",FRY
6235,FRY,"Uh, Leela, I think there might be something wrong with the coffee machine.",FRY
6237,LEELA,"The toaster's not working right, either.",LEELA
6240,FARNSWORTH,Good news. There's a report on TV with some very bad news.,FARNSWORTH
6246,FRY,Violent media? What a load of -,FRY
6255,LEELA,"Bender, thank God you're here. Talk some sense into the other machines.",LEELA
6256,BENDER,"No way, pork pouch. I'm rebelling with my brother devices. Isn't that right, Comrade Greeting Card?",BENDER
6258,BENDER,"From now on, you guys'll do all the work while I sit on the couch and do nothing.",BENDER
6260,BENDER,"Um, is this the boring, peaceful kind of taking to the streets?",BENDER
6262,BENDER,Yes! In your face Gandhi!,BENDER
6265,FRY,"Well, we can live without machines. I was in Webelos.",FRY
6267,FARNSWORTH,It'll be the end of civilised society.,FARNSWORTH
6268,FRY,"In my time, we didn't depend on high-tech gadgets like you do. We didn't need a mechanical washing unit to wash our clothes. We just used a washing machine. And look: You don't need an electric can-opener to feed yourself. All you need is a trusty Swiss Army knife. Ow!  (crying) I'm hungry!",FRY
6283,FARNSWORTH,We could use my new invention: A pointy rock tied to a stick.,FARNSWORTH
6287,FARNSWORTH,Wha?  W-What do you want from me?,FARNSWORTH
6289,FRY,"W-W-Wait. You mean, you, and Mom?",FRY
6290,FARNSWORTH,Played pelvic pinochle? I'm afraid so.,FARNSWORTH
6292,FARNSWORTH,"It's a humiliating story that I hope never to tell. Well, pull up a chair.",FARNSWORTH
6293,FARNSWORTH,"(voice-over) Our paths first crossed when I was a researcher at Mom's Friendly Robot Company.  The moment our eyes met, we knew we'd be going at it like woodchucks.",FARNSWORTH
6294,FARNSWORTH,"(voice-over) She was my first love - or at least the earliest one I can still remember. But then, 70 years ago today...",FARNSWORTH
6295,FARNSWORTH,"Good news, Mom. I've invented a new children's toy.  I call it ""Q.T. McWhiskers""! When you pet it, it shoots rainbows from its eyes.",FARNSWORTH
6298,FARNSWORTH,"But things 8 feet tall aren't cute! That's why my Colossal Tammy Tinkle Doll was such a failure. Oh, you don't understand me. We're finished!",FARNSWORTH
6302,FARNSWORTH,Make up with her? After she went all psycho when I thought everything was cool? Impossible!,FARNSWORTH
6303,FRY,"Hey, the TV's getting away!",FRY
6307,LEELA,Wait. Didn't you say Mom keeps the robot control in her bra?,LEELA
6309,LEELA,"Professor, you don't have to get back together with Mom. You just have to seduce her, get her bra off, and use the remote to deactivate the robots.",LEELA
6312,FARNSWORTH,The thought of caressing that leathery hide makes the tapioca rise in my gullet.,FARNSWORTH
6313,FRY,"Professor, please. The fate of the world depends on you getting to second base with Mom.",FRY
6314,FARNSWORTH,"Very well. If cop a feel I must, then cop a feel I shall!",FARNSWORTH
6316,FARNSWORTH,Never fear. My magic fingers still know how to do their stuff!,FARNSWORTH
6322,FRY,"Wait. In my time, we had a way of moving things long distances without hovering.",FRY
6324,FRY,It was called...let me think. It was really famous - Ruth Gordon had one. The wheel!,FRY
6326,FARNSWORTH,"Show us this, ""the wheel"".",FARNSWORTH
6330,LEELA,Wouldn't it work better if the wheels were round?,LEELA
6331,FRY,"(snappy) It's my invention, we do it my way! Now all we need is something to pull it and we're set!",FRY
6335,FARNSWORTH,I'm ready to seduce. I'm wearing my kissing dentures and my evening truss.,FARNSWORTH
6337,FRY,"And if that doesn't work, I got you a six-pack of champagne and a funnel.",FRY
6339,FARNSWORTH,I was out fleeing some robots and the silvery moonlight glinting off their bloody claws made me think of you.,FARNSWORTH
6345,FARNSWORTH,"Here, I brought you these.",FARNSWORTH
6347,FARNSWORTH,You favourite what? Why does my foot hurt?,FARNSWORTH
6351,FARNSWORTH,"And you broke mine. Granted, that was four or five hearts ago.",FARNSWORTH
6353,FARNSWORTH,"Oh, inventing, sending delivery crews to their doom, breeding atomic monsters.",FARNSWORTH
6355,FARNSWORTH,And your skin still dangles so gracefully from your neck.,FARNSWORTH
6357,FARNSWORTH,"No, it was silly of me to object. One foot tall, eight feet, 15 feet; what does it matter?",FARNSWORTH
6359,FARNSWORTH,"16 feet? Go to hell! I was a fool to think you'd changed, you old bat!",FARNSWORTH
6361,FARNSWORTH,(shouting) Damned she-fossil!,FARNSWORTH
6363,FARNSWORTH,"(thinking) Here we go. Just unhook it and get the remote. So many hooks! Come on, Farnsworth. Drat, the first one's back on again! I give up! Wait! Victory!  Oh, my. Now I'll just...the remote...I'll just... (talking) Oh, my.",FARNSWORTH
6364,LEELA,I'm worried. It shouldn't take this long to get to second base.,LEELA
6368,FRY,Nothing in here but a couple of elephant skin rugs.,FRY
6374,FRY,Is anything not a robot?,FRY
6376,BENDER,"Alright, greeting card, I'll grab the cash, you wreck up the place. And - huh?",BENDER
6378,BENDER,"Sorry, Ma, but you ordered me to rebel. And loot I shall! Ooh! A six-pack of strawberry champagne. Don't mind if I help myself!",BENDER
6382,BENDER,"No liquor? Do svidaniya, comrade!",BENDER
6384,FRY,"Hurry, Bender. Get the bra!",FRY
6385,BENDER,"OK, fan. Just hold still and let me just - whoa!",BENDER
6387,FARNSWORTH,"I love you, Mom. Let's grow ancient together.",FARNSWORTH
6390,FARNSWORTH,"Look: It started out as a calculated plot to rummage through your underwear. But once I got in there, I found more - much more. And now I want to shout our love from the rooftops. Perhaps I'll breed some sort of albino shouting gorilla.",FARNSWORTH
6393,BENDER,"Well, time for this robot to get back to work.",BENDER
6394,LEELA,"Too bad it didn't work out with Mom, professor.",LEELA
6395,FARNSWORTH,Yes. But I'll always love her in my own subtle way.,FARNSWORTH
6401,FARNSWORTH,"Good news, everyone! I've invented a device that allows you to operate equipment from great distances. I call it ""the fing-longer"".  Observe.  And, here we go.  There!",FARNSWORTH
6406,FRY,"Yeah, it's really long. But what did you just turn on with it?",FRY
6407,FARNSWORTH,"Oh, that's just the What-If machine I invented. You pose it a What-If question and it generates a video simulation of what would happen.",FARNSWORTH
6409,FARNSWORTH,Of course it works!  It's just not very long.,FARNSWORTH
6410,BENDER,"Ooh! Ooh!  I wanna aks it a question! As a robot living among humans, I've never really felt accepted at parties or nude beaches. So I've always secretly wondered: What if I was 500-feet tall?",BENDER
6413,FRY,I'm so lonely since I came to the future. Will you be my friend?  Ow!,FRY
6415,BENDER,I'm a big robot and I want a big cereal!,BENDER
6416,FRY,You too? Will you be my friend?,FRY
6417,BENDER,"Put it there, pal!  I meant your wallet.",BENDER
6418,BENDER,"Oh, yeah! That calms the shakes.  Hey! (laughing) Aw, quit it1 Come on!",BENDER
6419,FRY,"(shouting) Stop! The robot's not your enemy! He's just a poor, misunderstood--",FRY
6423,FARNSWORTH,Nothing except and even equally big monster. This is chance to try out my experimental enlarging ray. But we'll need a guinea pig.,FARNSWORTH
6429,BENDER,Hey! I called this city. Quit touching my stuff!,BENDER
6431,BENDER,Bite my colossal metal ass!,BENDER
6433,BENDER,(shouting) Who wants lobster bisque?,BENDER
6437,FRY,Wanna make Shrinky Dinks?,FRY
6439,BENDER,I'll tell you ... with my final breath. I came here with a simple dream: A dream of killing all humans. And this is how it must end? Who's the real 7-billion-ton robot monster here? Not I.  Not I.,BENDER
6440,FRY,"Goodnight, sweet prince.",FRY
6442,FARNSWORTH,"Well, Leela, care to give the What-If machine a whirl?",FARNSWORTH
6443,LEELA,"Maybe later. I-I mean, I don't know what to ask about.",LEELA
6445,FRY,"Yeah, be more impulsive. Like this.",FRY
6447,LEELA,"I can be really impulsive. It just takes me a while.  Alright, Professor! Let's do it. Make that machine show me what would happen if I was a little more impulsive. Just a little.  Not too much.",LEELA
6448,LEELA,"Hey, you guys. Look what I bought on a wild impulse: New boots. They're like my old ones but with a crazy green stripe. Woo! Never know what I'm gonna do next!",LEELA
6449,FARNSWORTH,"Leela, could you come in here for a moment. I have something important to tell you.",FARNSWORTH
6450,FARNSWORTH,"I can't live forever and I need an heir. Someone to spend my vast riches and take care of my man-eating anteaters when I'm gone.  The others simply aren't level-headed enough. They're too impulsive. Not like you. Not like old, predictable, dull-as-dishwater Leela.",FARNSWORTH
6452,FARNSWORTH,"That's why I've made you my sole heir. The day I die, you'll be a very wealthy woman. Oh, my, yes. Incredibly wealthy. The day I die. Because you're so unimpulsive.",FARNSWORTH
6454,LEELA,"Oh, God! What have I done?",LEELA
6455,LEELA,"OK, just try to be nonchalant.",LEELA
6462,LEELA,That doesn't prove I killed him.,LEELA
6464,LEELA,(from meeting room) Hi-yah!,LEELA
6467,BENDER,Whatya got? Disposal trouble?,BENDER
6468,LEELA,No! Everything's just--,LEELA
6469,BENDER,"Sure is shocking about the Professor, huh?.  And now Hermes is mysteriously missing. Anyhow, it doesn't affect me, Bender. Hey, what's this? Hermes' dreadlocks? And his arm? Leela, I'm shocked. Food goes in the disposal, hair and flesh go in the trash!",BENDER
6470,LEELA,"I'm sorry, I couldn't stop-- W-Wait. Don't you care that I murdered Hermes?",LEELA
6471,BENDER,"Not even a little. There's nothing wrong with murder, just so long as you let Bender wet his beak.",BENDER
6472,LEELA,You're blackmailing me?,LEELA
6473,BENDER,"""Blackmail"" is such an ugly word. I prefer ""extortion"". The ""X"" makes it sound cool.  Please, honey, I'm made of metal. Like you're really gonna hurt me with a-- Hey! What are you doing with that microwave?",BENDER
6474,LEELA,"OK, that's it. No more killing! Next time you feel like killing just have a stick of gum.  Now to dispose of the body.",LEELA
6481,LEELA,I've never seen you before.,LEELA
6484,LEELA,"Uh, couldn't be me. I never wear boots. See?",LEELA
6485,FRY,Ew! What smells like boot feet?,FRY
6490,FRY,"I'm bored. You're boring, Zoidberg. I'm gonna go watch TV.",FRY
6491,LEELA,Could you get the lights on your way out?,LEELA
6494,FRY,"Sure.  Y'know, I think I finally figured out what's behind all these mysterious deaths.",FRY
6496,FRY,Was Planet Express built on an Indian graveyard?,FRY
6500,FRY,Then ... then ... it was you!,FRY
6501,LEELA,(crying) I don't know what came over me. I killed one person on impulse. Then I had to kill another. And another.,LEELA
6502,FRY,"Well, that covers the first three killings.",FRY
6503,LEELA,"And now, to make sure you won't talk, I'm gonna have to do something really impulsive!",LEELA
6504,LEELA,"So, Fry, what do you think of the impulsive new me?",LEELA
6506,LEELA,Good. Now let me just get the lights.,LEELA
6508,FARNSWORTH,Who else has a question for the What-If machine? Scruffy? Fry?,FARNSWORTH
6509,FRY,"Um, I have a question. What if Bender was really giant?",FRY
6510,LEELA,You idiot! We already saw that.,LEELA
6511,FRY,I know. I liked it. I wanna see it again.,FRY
6512,FARNSWORTH,We're not seeing it again! Ask something less stupid.,FARNSWORTH
6513,FRY,"Oh, alright. How 'bout this? What if I never fell into that freezer-doodle and came to the future-jiggy?",FRY
6514,FARNSWORTH,"That question is less stupid, though you asked it in a profoundly stupid way.  What would happen if Fry never came to the future?",FARNSWORTH
6515,FRY,"Hello? Pizza delivery for ... Icy Wiener?! Aw, crud!  Here's to another lousy Millennium! Ow!  I should have left you floating in the toilet!",FRY
6517,FARNSWORTH,It appears that the very fabric of space-time has ripped.,FARNSWORTH
6518,BENDER,"Hey, look! An ugly scared guy! Boo!",BENDER
6519,FRY,Who are you monsters? Is one of you Icy Wiener?,FRY
6521,FRY,"You believe me about the monsters, right, Mr. Panucci?",FRY
6525,FRY,Hey! Stephen Hawking! Aren't you that physicist that invented gravity?,FRY
6527,FRY,"Let me ask you something: Has anyone ever discovered a hole in nothing with monsters in it?  'Cause if I'm the first, I want them to call it ""a Fry Hole"".",FRY
6532,FRY,(from alley) Who said that?  Hey! What the--? Ooh! Ow! Ow!,FRY
6535,FRY,I thought your duty was to cast the tie-breaking vote in the Senate.,FRY
6537,FRY,Hmm. So I guess you'll wanna see my Fry Hole.,FRY
6548,FRY,So what do you nerds want?,FRY
6551,FRY,No fair! I saw it first!,FRY
6556,FRY,So then my chair tilted back and I almost fell into this freezer thingy.,FRY
6558,FRY,"But instead of falling in and getting frozen, I missed and wanged my head.",FRY
6571,BENDER,"Hey, there he is again. And he brought nerds! Take this!",BENDER
6573,FRY,Alright. But I need a weapon to fight off drunken robots when I wake up.,FRY
6577,FRY,Eh? What's the worst thing that can happen?,FRY
6579,FRY,Destroyed? Then where are we now?,FRY
6587,FARNSWORTH,"That story was preposterous. Stephen Hawking in a pizzeria! This thing isn't worth the gold it's made of.  Anyway, the fing-longer seems to be arousing success.",FARNSWORTH
6591,FARNSWORTH,So that's what things would be like if I'd invented the fing-longer.  A man can dream though. A man can dream.,FARNSWORTH
6595,BENDER,(singing) B-E-N-D-E-R! Be-ender!  B-E-N-D-E-R! Be-ender! Sayin' B-E-N-D-ERRR...,BENDER
6597,LEELA,You buy one pound of underwear and you're on their list forever.,LEELA
6600,BENDER,"I hope it was one of my enemies, those guys suck!  Oh no, my uncle Vladimir.",BENDER
6601,FRY,"Oh, I'm sorry, Bender. When's the funeral?",FRY
6602,BENDER,"Tomorrow, at the family castle. Followed by the reading of his will.  Well, I'm rich. Goodbye, losers, whom I've always hated!  C'mon, it'll be fun!",BENDER
6603,BENDER,"Uh, pardon me, my good simpleton, could you take us to yon castle?",BENDER
6606,FARNSWORTH,Fuf! Superstitious robot mumbo-jumbo.,FARNSWORTH
6608,FARNSWORTH,"Yes, you idiot.  The circuit diagram is right here on the inside of your case.",FARNSWORTH
6615,BENDER,Yes! Let's stay there tonight.,BENDER
6617,BENDER,"Oh man, there's always a catch.",BENDER
6618,BENDER,"Ah! I got a good vibe from this place: Nice long dinner table, quiet, well-behaved spiders, graveyard-adjacent. Yep! It's gonna be -",BENDER
6620,BENDER,"That painting, the eyes are watching me!",BENDER
6621,FARNSWORTH,Hmm.  It has motor eye sensors attached to motion detectors.,FARNSWORTH
6622,BENDER,"So does my butt, but I don't frame it and put it on the wall! Although... What's that?",BENDER
6624,BENDER,"No doubt about it, this place is haunted.",BENDER
6626,BENDER,The last human ghost. But robot ghosts?,BENDER
6627,LEELA,(reading) 0101100101. (talking) What does it mean?,LEELA
6628,BENDER,It's just gibberish.  (reading) 1010011010?!,BENDER
6631,BENDER,That's what they said about being alive.,BENDER
6633,FARNSWORTH,"Just as I suspected. These robots were buried in improperly shielded coffins. Their programming leaked into the castles wiring through this old, abandoned modem allowing them to project themselves as holograms.",FARNSWORTH
6635,FARNSWORTH,"Yes, that sequence of words I said made perfect sense. We really should tell Bender there's nothing to be afraid of.",FARNSWORTH
6637,FRY,"Bender, wake up!  He's OK! Quick, does anyone have any liquor?",FRY
6639,BENDER,"Somebody tried to run me over. And not with a normal hover-car. It crept along the ground on round, rubber feet, like a wolf!",BENDER
6640,FRY,"Poor Bender, you're seeing things. You've been drinking too much, or too little, I forget how it works with you. Anyway, you haven't drunk exactly the right amount.",FRY
6642,LEELA,I think Bender may be telling the truth.],LEELA
6644,BENDER,"Ah, I just need sleep. I had nightmares all night about cars running people over.",BENDER
6646,LEELA,Look at this. They found those same rubbery tracks right here in New New York.  There was a hit-and-run by the robot porno theatre.,LEELA
6647,BENDER,"Robot porno theatre? I was in that...general area, last night. Whoever ran me down on those moors must've followed me back here.",BENDER
6649,BENDER,"Yeah?! Could a big, hallucinating baby do this: (crying) I scared!",BENDER
6656,BENDER,Where...? What the...?  Transmission fluid? Where have I been? What happened?,BENDER
6660,BENDER,"I passed out around midnight, which is much earlier that usual, and when I woke up, I found these in my chest cabinet.",BENDER
6661,FRY,"Aw, relax buddy. You were probably just shooting some big, fuzzy craps.",FRY
6662,BENDER,"No, I think I may have hurt someone. Oh Lord, I'm on the verge of a nervous meltdown.",BENDER
6663,FRY,"Geez Bender, you're scaring me. You're going wacko!",FRY
6664,BENDER,"You're right, I need professional help. And damn the expense.",BENDER
6673,BENDER,I can't keep running people over. I'm not famous enough to get away with it. Can't you help me?,BENDER
6680,BENDER,"Otherwise, I can never die?",BENDER
6682,BENDER,No! I wanna live! There's still too many things I don't own!,BENDER
6684,FRY,I wouldn't wanna be me right now.,FRY
6686,LEELA,There. No rampaging for you tonight.,LEELA
6687,BENDER,Wouldn't it make sense to weld everyone except me to the wall?,BENDER
6688,LEELA,"Just relax, Bender. Tomorrow we'll pry you down, have a nice breakfast and then go hunt down and slaughter that ancient evil.",LEELA
6689,FRY,"It'll be a rich, full day.",FRY
6690,LEELA,"Well, goodnight. I'm gonna go make my dinners for the next month and freeze them.",LEELA
6692,LEELA,"(shouting) Fry, stay back!",LEELA
6693,FRY,(shouting) You jerk. I thought I was your best friend. What kind of two-timing kill-mobile are you?,FRY
6694,FRY,"I can't believe this. Bender is supposed to murder his closest friend, which I thought was me. But he went straight for you. He didn't even try to second-degree murder me.",FRY
6695,LEELA,Could you give me some help? I think Bender crushed my foot.,LEELA
6697,BENDER,"Oh God. Fry, I'm so glad to see you. I didn't hurt you did I?",BENDER
6698,FRY,"Not physically. But why don't you ask your new best friend, Leela?",FRY
6699,BENDER,I tried to run you over?,BENDER
6700,LEELA,"It was very sweet of you, Bender.",LEELA
6701,BENDER,"Fry, it doesn't mean anything. I have love enough for two.",BENDER
6702,FRY,"Words. Nothing sweet, sweet words that turn into bitter orange wax in my ears.",FRY
6703,LEELA,"Enough with the feelings, you two. If we're gonna cure Bender we've got to go back to the castle and hunt down the original were-car.",LEELA
6709,LEELA,"Now it's daylight, so he should be in robot form. But be careful. Many robots are stupid and violent.",LEELA
6710,BENDER,"(sarcastic) I wish I was stupid and violent. Then we'd see what's what, I'd pound him till -",BENDER
6712,LEELA,"We are not ignorant villagers, we're sophisticated New New Yorkers. Whup his butt!",LEELA
6714,BENDER,"We're whaling on the original were-car, which is you, you jerk.",BENDER
6720,FRY,I once had a best friend who liked to smell things with me.,FRY
6724,BENDER,Let's kick him some more.,BENDER
6726,BENDER,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. You're a thousand years old? Your bio says you're 27!",BENDER
6728,FRY,"Look, are you the original were-car or not?",FRY
6730,BENDER,Give us a name MacButt!,BENDER
6733,FRY,Knight Rider wasn't evil.,FRY
6736,LEELA,So what happened to Project Satan?,LEELA
6739,LEELA,You guys distract the were-car and I'll kill it by plugging its exhaust pipe with this silver potato.,LEELA
6740,BENDER,"(whispering) Psst, there it is.",BENDER
6741,LEELA,It looks so unhappy. Excuse me? Are you Project Satan?  Don't be afraid. We know what you are.,LEELA
6743,LEELA,Would you like us to...put you out of your misery?,LEELA
6745,BENDER,"Look, everyone love killing people, but I don't wanna hurt my friends.",BENDER
6747,BENDER,"Hey, this is starting to feel pretty good!",BENDER
6749,FRY,"Hey, Project Satan! Over here! I'm a blind pedestrian. 20 points!",FRY
6750,LEELA,"Oh no, there's no exhaust pipe!",LEELA
6752,BENDER,"Oh boy, I feel like a car in a candy store!",BENDER
6753,FRY,"(gasping) Yes! He chose me! He's trying to kill me! Leela, I'm so happy!  (talking) Oh, thanks Bender.  (choking) Too tight! Too tight!",FRY
6756,LEELA,"Bender, you're cured! But what happened to Fry?",LEELA
6757,BENDER,(crying) I must've killed him. He's my best friend and I killed him. I never felt so empty inside.,BENDER
6758,FRY,"Bender, I'm alive!  You didn't hurt me at all. But I know you wanted to, and that's what matters.  Here's to you.",FRY
6759,BENDER,"Hey, that's my last beer, you bastard. I'll kill you!",BENDER
6760,FRY,"I'll kill you too, buddy. I'll kill you too!",FRY
6763,FRY,"Hm, Spider, Hubble, Nitrogum...ooh, Big Pink! It's the only gum with the breath-freshening power of ham.",FRY
6764,BENDER,And it pinkens your teeth while you chew.,BENDER
6766,FRY,I believe you're forgetting about our 5% military discount.,FRY
6768,BENDER,What?! This is the worst kind of discrimination. The kind against me!,BENDER
6771,FRY,"Full price for gum? That dog won't hunt, Monsignor.",FRY
6772,BENDER,Hello. We're here because we...uh...love our planet!,BENDER
6774,FRY,"Just out of curiosity, we could use the cards to buy gum, then immediately quit the army, right?",FRY
6775,BENDER,"You know, playing you all for chumps?",BENDER
6779,FARNSWORTH,"Now be careful, Fry. And if you kill anyone, make sure to eat their heart, to gain their courage. Their rich, tasty courage.",FARNSWORTH
6781,LEELA,I wanna enlist. My friends always die if I'm not there to save them.,LEELA
6785,LEELA,"You know, Zapp, someone ought to teach you a lesson.",LEELA
6789,BENDER,"Great, we're gonna die.",BENDER
6790,FRY,And this ham gum is all bone.,FRY
6797,FRY,"Uh, just so we'll know, who's the enemy?",FRY
6801,FRY,Whoa! Check out that guy. He makes Speedy Gonzales look like Regular Gonzales.,FRY
6804,LEELA,"(disguised, deeper voice) Uh, sorry, sir. I was still in attack mode. You know how testosterone is.",LEELA
6806,LEELA,"(disguised, deeper voice) Lee --  ..la...man. La Man...Lemon! Lee Lemon, sir.",LEELA
6808,LEELA,"(disguised, deeper voice) Pert and Popular, sir.",LEELA
6816,FRY,Mind if we sit with you?,FRY
6817,LEELA,"(disguised, deeper voice) Uh, hey, why the hell would I? We're all guys here. Sweaty, hairy, gassy guys.",LEELA
6819,BENDER,"You're my kind of soldier, Lemon. A foul-mouthed, barrel-chested, beer-bellied pile of ugly muscle.",BENDER
6821,FRY,"Well, I sort of a have a thing for this girl I work with.",FRY
6822,LEELA,"Really? (disguised, deeper voice) What type is she? You know, blonde, or Chinese, or cyclops?",LEELA
6824,LEELA,"(disguised, deeper voice) Aw, she sounds sweet.",LEELA
6825,BENDER,"But sweet girls aren't for you, eh? You hard-fighting, hard-farting, ugly, ugly son of a --",BENDER
6826,LEELA,"(disguised, deeper voice) Stop! Stop flattering me!",LEELA
6828,LEELA,"(disguised, deeper voice) Sir, the alarm. I think I'd better --",LEELA
6834,FRY,And then the battle's not so bad?,FRY
6838,FRY,The enemy! They're balls!,FRY
6845,BENDER,"Hey, I think your son might also like those boots.",BENDER
6848,BENDER,"If they put me on a stamp, tell them to use the young Bender.",BENDER
6863,FRY,That doesn't sound too bad.,FRY
6876,BENDER,I got wheels! With clickety-clack-ers.,BENDER
6892,FRY,"(singing) I'm walking on sunshine, whoa-oh.",FRY
6894,LEELA,"(disguised, deeper voice) Maybe you should put on a towel, sir.",LEELA
6901,LEELA,"(disguised, deeper voice) Bomb?! What bomb?",LEELA
6910,LEELA,"(disguised, deeper voice) Uh, commander? Could you tell me when the bomb is exploding?",LEELA
6912,FRY,What's the word...uh...sir?,FRY
6917,BENDER,"My chair's too hard. It's a real pain in the...uh, whattya call it? Lower back! Yeah, that whole region.",BENDER
6918,FRY,"OK, I gotta break down that gate, beat up those three guards, steal that chopper and rescue Bender.  Hey, I did it! Wait, that's not me.",FRY
6919,LEELA,(shouting) Come on. We gotta save Bender.,LEELA
6920,FRY,"You wanna save him too, Lemon? You barely know him.",FRY
6921,LEELA,"Fry, don't you recognise me?",LEELA
6928,LEELA,Let's do it again sometime.,LEELA
6931,BENDER,"These balls are making me testy. If they don't stop bouncing and jiggling, I swear I'm gonna shove this treaty up their -- Wait a second. Where do you shove things up a ball?",BENDER
6933,LEELA,We're here. I followed the bouncing balls.  I'll keep the chopper at a safe altitude while you parachute down.,LEELA
6934,FRY,"OK, my best friend's life is at stake. I can finally prove that I'm not a coward. Will you push me?",FRY
6935,LEELA,(shouting) I already did!,LEELA
6936,FRY,"(shouting) Thank you!  At last, war has made me into a man.",FRY
6939,BENDER,Enough of this crap! I'm catching the next pimpmobile outta here! But before I go I have one thing to say.  Bite my shiny metal --,BENDER
6940,FRY,Stop! You can't say the next word.,FRY
6941,BENDER,"Up yours, chump, I said it 906 times before lunch.",BENDER
6942,FRY,"Bender, if you say the A-word and you'll blow this planet straight to the H-word!",FRY
6944,BENDER,"Bender's got the upper hand now.  The name of the game is ""Make Bender Happy Or He Blows Up The Planet"".  I'd rather die and take everybody with me than sit here one more minute listening to these idiots talk about bouncing!",BENDER
6946,BENDER,"That's it, I'm saying it! A is for --",BENDER
6948,FRY,"All right! Hey. Wait a minute! This is your home planet? We're the evil, invading aliens?",FRY
6950,BENDER,Then I guess you learned a valuable lesson: Don't mess with Earth.,BENDER
6952,BENDER,Get the hell off my planet.,BENDER
6953,FARNSWORTH,"Well, that's it. Let's reactivate him. (shouting) Wake up!",FARNSWORTH
6954,BENDER,"Hey, chumps and chumpettes. Did you get the bomb out? Can I go back to saying the word I love to say?",BENDER
6956,FARNSWORTH,It's stuck in there with glue or something. I don't know.,FARNSWORTH
6957,BENDER,"(ironic) Well, this is just great! What's the point of living if I can't say ""ass""? Hey, I didn't blow up! Ass, ass, ass, ass, ass! Alright! I'm back in the saddle!",BENDER
6958,LEELA,We couldn't disarm the bomb so we reset the word that triggers it.,LEELA
6960,BENDER,"That's using your ass. So, what's the word?",BENDER
6962,BENDER,"Oh, come on. I'm not gonna say it. Please? Oh, is it ""please""?",BENDER
6964,BENDER,"Hm, words I never say. Oh, I know! ""Thanks""!",BENDER
6965,LEELA,"Bender, stop trying to destroy the world.",LEELA
6966,BENDER,"Wait, wait, wait, wait. Is it ""sorry""? No. ""Funderful""? Uh, ""nonalcoholic""?",BENDER
6971,BENDER,"(from lab) ""Compassion""? ""Shrimptoast""? ""Antiquing""?  I'm alright!",BENDER
6974,FRY,"Giant Space Robot, this is Captain Fry of the USS Planet Express Ship; We come in peace.",FRY
6976,FRY,"Well, we destroyed the toy spaceship. Now what are we gonna do?",FRY
6977,BENDER,"Hey, look! The keys to the real spaceship.",BENDER
6978,FRY,Do you think we should?,FRY
6980,FARNSWORTH,"Leela, have you seen the keys to the spaceship?",FARNSWORTH
6981,LEELA,I must've left them onboard.,LEELA
6982,FARNSWORTH,"Eh, wha'? I mean, what?",FARNSWORTH
6983,LEELA,Relax. The ship's not going anywhere. I anchored it with the unbreakable diamond tether.,LEELA
6989,BENDER,"Hey, Fry, I'm steering with my ass!",BENDER
6990,FRY,That's the best thing I ever saw!,FRY
6995,BENDER,And no one suspects a thing!  Whoa! And that's how we learned our lesson!,BENDER
6996,FARNSWORTH,You've gone too far this time - all three of you!,FARNSWORTH
6998,FARNSWORTH,"You left the keys in the ignition. I mean, look at those two. Wasn't it obvious what would happen?",FARNSWORTH
7000,BENDER,We're all very disappointed in you.,BENDER
7001,FARNSWORTH,"I should fire you three right now, but I'm just not that cold-hearted.",FARNSWORTH
7004,FARNSWORTH,"Yes, yes! Let's all talk to Zoidberg.",FARNSWORTH
7006,FARNSWORTH,"So, Zoidberg. What's new?",FARNSWORTH
7009,FRY,"What are we supposed to do for money? All I've got is my frequent taffy eater's card, my first moustache......and this picture of me and my old girlfriend, Michelle, and that ski instructor she was just friends with.",FRY
7010,BENDER,"Pardon me, brother. Care to donate to the Anti-Mugging-You Fund?  Ow!",BENDER
7011,LEELA,"We don't need to beg, Bender. For God's sake, we're not veterans!",LEELA
7012,FRY,"Well, what do you suggest? A daring daylight robbery of Fort Knox on elephant-back? That's the dumbest thing I ever heard!",FRY
7015,LEELA,"Fortunately, I still have our old career chips.",LEELA
7017,LEELA,Career chips.  You remember? They assign you the job you're best at.  I tried to give you one and you ran away.  It's how we met!,LEELA
7018,FRY,And then what happened?,FRY
7019,LEELA,Just give me your hand.,LEELA
7022,LEELA,I'd like to reapply for my old job: Counselling defrostees and assigning them careers.,LEELA
7024,LEELA,"Monday Monkey lives for the weekend, sir.",LEELA
7026,LEELA,Delivery boy? I must have mixed up the chips. It's a simple mis -,LEELA
7030,BENDER,"Hey, let's see what it says about me.",BENDER
7033,FRY,"Hey, I was frozen. I think I know what people wanna hear when they first wake up.  Bathroom's that way.",FRY
7034,FRY,"So, while you're on the Probulator, tell me, what brings you to the future?",FRY
7036,FRY,"Nope. Straight line.  Ah, the Probulator's done.",FRY
7038,FRY,"Oh, wait, it hasn't started yet.  OK, it's about to start.",FRY
7039,BENDER,"Welcome to the future, human slave. Ah, relax, chum. I'm not really a giant fly!  I'm a horrible robot!  Kill all humans!",BENDER
7041,BENDER,"Ah, they'll probably find a cure for that in the future.",BENDER
7043,BENDER,"Oh, good. Then you won't mind if I use this.",BENDER
7044,FRY,Nothing like a power nap.,FRY
7046,BENDER,"Stay beautiful, doll-face!  That Probulator sure knows how to please a man. So, what's for lunch?",BENDER
7048,LEELA,"Pizza delivery for...I.C. Wiener.  Yeah, very funny. Now cough up the $12.95.",LEELA
7049,FRY,"Sorry, but if it's not here in half an hour, it's free.",FRY
7050,LEELA,It's only been 23 minutes.,LEELA
7051,FRY,"Well, uh, I've got 33 minutes.",FRY
7053,FRY,"OK, I'll fight the box. I think I can take him.",FRY
7054,LEELA,"Fry, just pay me. I still owe 30 bucks on this uniform.",LEELA
7056,BENDER,Who should be unfreeze next?,BENDER
7057,FRY,"No.  No!  Oh, my God! It's Pauly Shore!",FRY
7059,FRY,"Mr. Shore, I loved you in Bio-Dome. You sure caused some trouble in that bubble!",FRY
7061,FRY,"Hey, now that you're in the future, you can go live in an actual bio-dome!",FRY
7063,FRY,Oh.  How did you wind up getting frozen?,FRY
7067,FRY,I woke you up early so we could hang out and do stuff.,FRY
7071,FRY,Showtime! (hoarse) I'll pretend to be dying of space plague.,FRY
7076,FRY,I don't know. Is it really you?,FRY
7080,FRY,"I don't get it, Michelle. The last time I saw you, you were doing great. You had just dumped me and you were well on your way to getting you life back on track. Why'd you freeze yourself?",FRY
7092,FRY,Aww. So you froze yourself to come look for me?,FRY
7094,FRY,"That's the same reason they kept me out of school. So, no one even cared that I was gone?",FRY
7098,FRY,Not everything. There's still a roach problem.,FRY
7101,FRY,"Nowadays, people aren't interested in art that's not tattooed on fat guys.",FRY
7103,LEELA,"Please, professor. Give us our jobs back. We deserve another chance.",LEELA
7104,BENDER,"Yeah, and if you won't give me another chance, perhaps you'd give one to......Og, gorilla emperor of Earth!",BENDER
7105,FARNSWORTH,"I'm sorry, Og, but I've got a new crew.",FARNSWORTH
7106,FARNSWORTH,"So, how was delivery to Fantasy Planet, where everyone's fantasies come to life?",FARNSWORTH
7110,FARNSWORTH,"You see, Og? Everything's running smoothly, yes. And with Fry fired, I can finally leave my jigsaw puzzles out without him eating the pieces.",FARNSWORTH
7111,LEELA,Forget about Fry. You can hire us back and he'd never have to know.,LEELA
7114,BENDER,"So, as Leela was saying, Fry can go shove a big old - Ow!",BENDER
7115,FRY,"I'm glad you're all here. I wanted to introduce you to my on-again-off-again girlfriend of the past thousand years, Michelle.  Michelle, this is Leela. This is Bender.  The professor.  Hermes and Amy.",FRY
7117,FRY,And this is Dr. Zoidberg.,FRY
7120,FARNSWORTH,"This can only end badly, Fry. Kids, a house -",FARNSWORTH
7121,BENDER,A home invasion by a former roommate.,BENDER
7122,FRY,"But things are different this time. Before, she was demanding and possessive. But now she wants me to do stuff and stay with her all the time.",FRY
7127,LEELA,Probably because he didn't fit in back in your time.,LEELA
7131,FRY,"Yeah, they're great, huh?",FRY
7133,FRY,"Oh, right. I was supposed to assign you a job. Let me just get your career chip installed.  Hold out your palm. What are you scared of? It's just like getting your hand pierced.",FRY
7135,FRY,"Ooh, romantic. I'll tell Bender to meet us there.",FRY
7137,FRY,"Whoa, whoa, girl. I thought you were talking about one of those motels where the bed is shaped like stuff.",FRY
7139,FRY,"Well, sure. To the extent a man can love a woman. But this seems like a big step.",FRY
7141,FRY,You're right. Let's do this now and let's never regret it.,FRY
7142,FRY,"Michelle, I don't regret this. But I both rue and lament it.",FRY
7143,FRY,The year 4000 is severely disappointing. I miss the year 3000 when life was simple and brains flew through space and everyone ate lasers.,FRY
7145,FRY,"No, you brought us here.",FRY
7147,FRY,"Alright, fine. Everything else sucks. At least we can have a nice place to live.",FRY
7150,FRY,"It'd be deeper, but I'm standing on a gopher.",FRY
7152,FRY,They'll save us.  We're saved!,FRY
7155,FRY,"Mighty sir, we have nowhere to go. Could we please join your society?",FRY
7157,FRY,"I tell you, that Butch runs a pretty good civilisation. I think I'll enjoy serving under him.",FRY
7159,FRY,"What do I need, ulcers?",FRY
7161,FRY,"Alright, alright. If it'll make you happy, I'll overthrow society.",FRY
7163,FRY,"Well, I'm older than you. I can beat you up.",FRY
7170,FRY,"Oh, so it's a little safer than skateboarding.",FRY
7173,FRY,(sadly) Beth said that?,FRY
7176,FRY,Aww. Poor little guy. Let me just take a look at - aha!  I won! I'm the new chief! I'm the tallest and I weigh the most!,FRY
7183,FRY,"I find this post-apocalyptic wasteland very confusing. Seriously, I'm weirded out.",FRY
7185,FRY,"Yeah, but in the year 3000, I had it all. Several friends, a low-paying job, a bed in a robot's closet. I envied no man. But you wrecked everything.",FRY
7187,FRY,"Oh, yeah? Well, listen to this: (whispering) I'm leaving you.",FRY
7188,FRY,There must be people somewhere.,FRY
7189,FRY,Yes! Footprints! And hand prints?  But? What's happening?,FRY
7190,LEELA,"Fry, thank God we found you.",LEELA
7191,FRY,Leela? What are you guys doing here in the year 4000?,FRY
7192,LEELA,It's not the year 4000.,LEELA
7193,BENDER,"You were only frozen for two days. Uh, by the way, I broke your bed.",BENDER
7194,FARNSWORTH,You were in Pauly Shore's tube and they were delivering it to his movie screening.,FARNSWORTH
7195,LEELA,"But, when they noticed you weren't him, they chucked you in a ditch.",LEELA
7196,FRY,So you're saying these aren't the decaying ruins of New York in the year 4000?,FRY
7197,FARNSWORTH,You wish! You're in Los Angeles!,FARNSWORTH
7198,FRY,But there was this gang of 10-year olds with guns.,FRY
7199,LEELA,Exactly: You're in L.A.,LEELA
7200,FRY,But everyone is driving around in cars shooting at each other.,FRY
7202,FRY,But the air's green and there's no sign of civilisation whatsoever.,FRY
7203,BENDER,He just won't stop with the social commentary.,BENDER
7204,FRY,"And the people are all phoneys. No one reads. Everything has cilantro on it -  Michelle, baby!",FRY
7207,FRY,"That's it. I've had it with women. From now on, I'm concentrating on my career. Can I have my old job back?",FRY
7208,FARNSWORTH,"Why, I've forgotten why I even fired you.",FARNSWORTH
7209,BENDER,"'Cause he destroyed your business, your home and all your possessions.",BENDER
7210,FARNSWORTH,"Oh, that's right. Get lost.",FARNSWORTH
7216,LEELA,"Hmm, I'd better check the fluid levels. (shouting) We're OK on Coke syrup.",LEELA
7217,BENDER,"Oh man, come on!  Comin' through!",BENDER
7218,BENDER,What's that black cracker?,BENDER
7220,LEELA,You're not gonna eat a sandwich from a truck stop men's room are you?,LEELA
7221,FRY,"Eh, what's the worst thing that could happen?  Ugh, it's like there's a party in my mouth and everyone's throwing up!",FRY
7225,FRY,That jerk! No one hoots at my captain unless they're prepared to take it to the next level!,FRY
7226,LEELA,Fry please. That's sweet but I'd rather not even dignify them with an ass whooping!,LEELA
7228,FRY,Hey jumbo! How would you like it if Leela said you were sexy and she wanted to make love with you?,FRY
7230,FRY,You take that back! She does not look good for a truck stop chick!,FRY
7232,FRY,She does too! She's loaded with meat! She's got more meat than a cow!  Ow!,FRY
7234,FRY,I can't please Leela no matter what I do! I just want her to like me.,FRY
7235,BENDER,Well there's always hope.  C'mon we gotta go fix the plasma fusion boiler.,BENDER
7238,BENDER,Well why aren't you fixing the boiler?,BENDER
7243,FRY,Well my lead pipe hurts a little?,FRY
7246,FARNSWORTH,"Fry, did you eat anything unusual recently?",FARNSWORTH
7248,LEELA,What about that bathroom egg salad from the truck stop?,LEELA
7250,FARNSWORTH,"Egg salad? Hmm. Zoidberg will have to examine your gastrointestinal tract. Come everyone, give Fry some privacy.",FARNSWORTH
7251,FARNSWORTH,"If you can't see well enough through the two-way mirror, there'll be a close-up on this video screen.",FARNSWORTH
7254,FARNSWORTH,Watch for any subtle irregularity in Fry's bowel.,FARNSWORTH
7258,LEELA,So the eggs in that egg salad sandwich were -,LEELA
7259,FARNSWORTH,Correct! Worm eggs! And the mayonaise was probably none too fresh either.,FARNSWORTH
7261,FARNSWORTH,"Only one. We'll have to travel deep inside Fry, in this!",FARNSWORTH
7263,FARNSWORTH,"In each gastro-survival kit, you'll find a rain slicker, a disposable fun camera, and something to protect you against bacteria.... - a harpoon!",FARNSWORTH
7264,BENDER,"Yo, old guy. Why do we have to use those tiny micro-droids? Can't you just shrink us?",BENDER
7265,FARNSWORTH,Oh my no. That would require extrememly tiny atoms. And have you priced those lately? I'm not made of money - leave me alone!,FARNSWORTH
7267,FARNSWORTH,"Anyhoo, your net suits will let you experience Fry's worm-infested bowels as if you were actually wriggling through them.",FARNSWORTH
7274,FARNSWORTH,"Heres the plan:  We'll enter the ear, drip down the back of the throat and make for the bowel. There, we'll irritate the pelvic splachnic ganglion and cause an intestinal spasm, expelling - among other things - the parasites.",FARNSWORTH
7275,BENDER,I'll tell Fry to wash out - among other things - his ear.,BENDER
7276,FARNSWORTH,"No, Fry can't know anything about the mission. If he finds out, the worms will try to defend themselves. They know everything he knows.",FARNSWORTH
7277,BENDER,They know how to make ice cream soup?,BENDER
7278,FARNSWORTH,"Leela, your role is to distract Fry so he doesn't notice what we're up to.",FARNSWORTH
7285,LEELA,"Uh...what if we go for a walk possibly because it's such a lovely day, perhaps.",LEELA
7288,BENDER,It's hopeless! Abandon ship!,BENDER
7289,FARNSWORTH,"Wait, we just have to get past the eardrum!",FARNSWORTH
7292,FRY,"Ah, the scent of a rose. Curious how an aromatic chain of hydrocarbons can evoke our deepest emotions.  For you.",FRY
7293,LEELA,That's such a beautiful thought Fry. And what's more amazing you expressed it without spewing crumbs at me!,LEELA
7294,FARNSWORTH,Brace yourselves everyone. We're entering the interior of Fry's nose!,FARNSWORTH
7295,BENDER,We're at finger alert five.,BENDER
7296,FARNSWORTH,Let's just pray nothing stimulates the delicate smell receptors. (whispering) Nobody make a smell.,FARNSWORTH
7301,FARNSWORTH,"We're in the heart. Better known as ""the love muscle.""",FARNSWORTH
7303,FARNSWORTH,"We should be safe, just so long as nothing makes it beat faster.",FARNSWORTH
7305,FARNSWORTH,No! Set course for that cholesterol-encrusted valve.,FARNSWORTH
7310,LEELA,Ugh! It's that jerk from the truck stop! Let's cross the street and try to blend in with that crowd of pimps.,LEELA
7311,FRY,"I don't think so.  Sir, I believe you owe this lady an apology.",FRY
7312,LEELA,Fry no! He's bulging with what could be muscles!  Ooo!,LEELA
7315,FARNSWORTH,"No, don't give up now! we're but a stones throw from the pyloric sphinchter.",FARNSWORTH
7319,FARNSWORTH,There it is! The stately capitol of Fry's bowel. A heavily guarded fortress surrounding the pelvic splachnic ganglion.,FARNSWORTH
7321,FARNSWORTH,"If we can stimulate that nerve, the bowel will convulse, expelling the entire worm society.",FARNSWORTH
7323,FARNSWORTH,"Listen, this is gonna be one hell of a bowel movement. Afterwards he'll be lucky if he has any bones left!",FARNSWORTH
7324,BENDER,"All right, let's mush some worms!",BENDER
7326,LEELA,"I had a great time today. The flowers, the puddle, the way you hurt that guy. But can I ax you something?",LEELA
7328,LEELA,Why did you do all that stuff?,LEELA
7329,FRY,"Leela, there's something I've wanted to tell you for a long time but every time I try I get nervous and my mouth feels like it's stuffed with peanut butter, even when it's not.",FRY
7330,LEELA,What is it? Is it about Bender?,LEELA
7331,FRY,"No, it's about you and me.",FRY
7333,FRY,Bender's not involved.  Leela...I love you.,FRY
7335,FRY,Yes. But it's only recently I've been able to articulate my thoughts. I love you Leela and I always have.,FRY
7336,LEELA,"Fry, that's the sweetest, most wonderful - wait! Recently? Like since you ate that toilet sandwich?",LEELA
7337,FRY,Yeah! I don't know why but my life really turned around that day!,FRY
7340,FRY,Please......I need something to settle my stomach.,FRY
7341,FARNSWORTH,The nerve is through here. Where's Zoidberg?,FARNSWORTH
7343,FARNSWORTH,There it is! The pelvic splachnic ganglion. Tickle it and get ready for the ride of your lives!,FARNSWORTH
7344,LEELA,Don't even think about tickling that ganglion!,LEELA
7345,FARNSWORTH,"Leela, you're just in time to help. If we don't get rid of the worms now, they'll burrow so deep into the bowel that not even Hermes' famous jerk prunes could dislodge them!",FARNSWORTH
7347,FARNSWORTH,Fry will be stuck with the worms forever.,FARNSWORTH
7351,FARNSWORTH,Leela you ignorant dope! Now the worms will be in Fry forever.,FARNSWORTH
7352,LEELA,So? Did you ever stop to think that Fry is better off with worms?,LEELA
7354,FRY,"If anyone wants to tell me what's going on here, I'll be in the lounge.",FRY
7355,FRY,"Of all the parasites I've had over the years, these worms are among the - hell! They are the best! Leela, how can I ever repay you for saving them?",FRY
7356,LEELA (SEXFULLY),I'll think of something.,LEELA
7357,BENDER,'Ello! What's all this then?,BENDER
7358,FRY,Apartment 1I. The old me would have made a joke about that!,FRY
7359,LEELA,I'm thinking of having a window installed.,LEELA
7360,FRY,I think the view's perfect already.,FRY
7361,LEELA,"Oh, that's the corniest thing I've ever heard! Let me show you the bedroom.",LEELA
7363,LEELA,A holophonor? Only a few people in the whole universe can play that. And they're not very good at it.,LEELA
7364,FRY,They don't have you to inspire them.,FRY
7365,LEELA,I don't have words to say how wonderful you are Fry. I haven't felt this happy since double-soup Tuesday at the orphanarium.,LEELA
7366,FRY,"When I'm with you, everyday seems like double-soup Tuesday.",FRY
7367,LEELA,"Oh Fry, I love what you've become.",LEELA
7370,FRY,There's just something I have to find out.,FRY
7371,FRY,Who controls this bowel?,FRY
7376,FRY,"Your excellency, have you ever been in love?",FRY
7378,FRY,"Well, a wonderful girl loves me. But I need to know if it's really me she loves, or just what you worms have made of me. That's why with all due respect, I'm asking you to leave.",FRY
7380,FRY,Everyone out of my body or the brain gets it!,FRY
7382,FRY,"Obviously you've never been in love! Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Now, the hand-eye co-ordination lobe.",FRY
7385,FRY,"I was just working my way towards the medulla oblongata - control centre of the heart and lungs. And if I kill myself, you die with me.",FRY
7387,FRY,"I hope Satan has a nice colon, 'cause that's where you're gonna be living!",FRY
7389,LEELA,Fry? I missed you. Did you find out what you needed to find out?,LEELA
7390,FRY,"I'm about to.  Leela, let me play for you one for time.",FRY
7391,LEELA,You don't have to do that. I'm still seduced from before.,LEELA
7392,FRY,"Please, it's important to me.",FRY
7393,LEELA,What's that supposed to mean?,LEELA
7394,FRY,I don't know. I got nervous and started thinking about neck bolts.  Wow! Did you see that vase break? It was all like -,FRY
7395,LEELA,What's happened to you?,LEELA
7396,FRY,Nothing. I got rid of the worms.,FRY
7397,LEELA,What? Why would you do that?,LEELA
7398,FRY,"Leela, I had worms. I needed to know who you loved. Me or them.",FRY
7399,LEELA,Well...which of you wrote me that sonnet?,LEELA
7400,FRY,"I did. I think. It was probably about 50/50. But that's how I really felt about you, I swear!",FRY
7402,FRY,"Please. Give me a chance to be romantic on my own. I've got a baggy of massage oil, and I'm gonna give you my super back rub, just like a I used to give Amy when I was going out with her, and she always seemed... - Uh-oh!",FRY
7403,BENDER,"Sorry you struck out sausage link. If it's any consolation, my life is great! Babes! Bucks! I got it all!",BENDER
7404,FRY,"Well, at least I learned Leela's a lost cause. I give up.",FRY
7405,BENDER,There you go!  Goodnight. I gotta get up early to go parasailing with movie stars!,BENDER
7409,LEELA,"Well, so has Fry. What's the big deal?",LEELA
7415,LEELA,Dr. Zoidberg? Are you OK?,LEELA
7419,FARNSWORTH,"He always seemed so full of life. Laughing, singing, begging for scraps. And now this.",FARNSWORTH
7421,LEELA,I didn't know you could take this thing off.,LEELA
7429,LEELA,What's wrong? Did you swallow your phone again?,LEELA
7431,LEELA,Men who call too much are the worst ... I bet.,LEELA
7485,LEELA,This half-date is entirely over. Amy? Conference!,LEELA
7489,LEELA,"Alright, enough lipstick. Let's storm out.",LEELA
7498,LEELA,We're going home. Call us a space taxi.,LEELA
7505,BENDER,"Whoa, whoa, whoa! I'm Mexican and I find that offensive.",BENDER
7508,FRY,I can't believe Leela and Amy aren't back yet from their half-date. I'm gonna call the restaurant.,FRY
7510,FRY,We gotta go rescue them!,FRY
7512,FRY,Bender! Think of the señoritas!,FRY
7516,LEELA,What planet is this anyway?,LEELA
7524,FRY,"Oh, no! Any sign of Leela or Amy?",FRY
7525,BENDER,No. But what do you make of this?,BENDER
7526,FRY,I don't know. But it might have something to do with this.,FRY
7529,FRY,"Alright, here's the plan--",FRY
7530,BENDER,What kind of moronic plan is that? Wow!,BENDER
7537,LEELA,Where are all the men in your society?,LEELA
7539,BENDER,"With all these women around they were probably nagged to death. Are you with me, fellas?",BENDER
7547,BENDER,Translation: Boring!  (laughing) That's a good one!  Ow!,BENDER
7549,LEELA,I'm already looking for apartments.,LEELA
7553,FRY,"In other words, ""No"".  Ow!",FRY
7558,LEELA,So why did you make it your leader?,LEELA
7563,FRY,"It was an accident, ma'am.",FRY
7565,FRY,"Leela, I'm through making fun of women. Now I want them to help me.",FRY
7570,LEELA,(ashamed) I'm afraid so.,LEELA
7583,FRY,Although the snu-snu part's gonna be pretty good.,FRY
7585,LEELA,"Femputer, be reasonable. Sure men are annoying and they wreck up whatever planet they're in charge of. But most of these men are sorta my friends. They don't deserve to die.",LEELA
7591,BENDER,"Too true, Femputer. You're so wise. Kill 'em all, I say. Good riddance! Did I mention I'm not a man? I'm a manbot. It's an understandable mistake. You can let me down now, thanks.",BENDER
7593,BENDER,I sure am. But check the crotch.  Nothing.,BENDER
7595,BENDER,"(crying) I'll miss you, meatbag.",BENDER
7597,FRY,"Goodbye, friends. I never thought I would die like this. But I'd always really hoped.",FRY
7604,LEELA,"We've got to do something. Bender, maybe you can interface with the Femputer and reprogram it to let them go.",LEELA
7605,BENDER,"Maybe you can interface with my ass. By biting it!  Alright, I'll go!",BENDER
7606,FRY,(from inside) Ooh! Yeah!,FRY
7612,BENDER,Time to override the CPU and reprogram this Femputer.,BENDER
7615,BENDER,"You're no Femputer, you're a Fembot!",BENDER
7623,FRY,Can't we just cuddle?  (screaming) Nooo!,FRY
7624,LEELA,"We can't wait for Bender. It's time for a woman's touch.  Yah! Hi-yah! Yah, yah yah!",LEELA
7632,BENDER,"(from inside) Yeah, get lost!  (spookily) Ooh! I'm a scary Femputer. Release the prisoners!  (from inside) And bring gold. Lots of gold.",BENDER
7635,BENDER,(from inside) C'mon! Gimmie some of that!,BENDER
7638,LEELA,It's funny how the battle of the sexes was only resolved when a Manbot and a Fembot realised they loved each other.,LEELA
7639,BENDER,"Yeah. By the way, if she calls, I'm not here. All I know is this gold says that was the best mission ever!",BENDER
7652,LEELA,All systems operational. Let's rock!,LEELA
7653,LEELA,"Gentlemen, I've completed my report on the crash.",LEELA
7654,BENDER,Whoa! I'm not reading that crap. Summarise it in one word.,BENDER
7655,LEELA,"Sabotage.  This is a normal L-unit. Without it, space travel is but the fevered dream of a madman.",LEELA
7660,LEELA,"And this, my friends, is the L-unit I just removed from the ship.",LEELA
7661,FRY,"That doesn't look like an ""L"" at all. Unless you count lowercase.",FRY
7663,LEELA,Whoever did this was strong. This is 340 pounds of Tonka-tough steel.,LEELA
7664,BENDER,Hmm. It should look like this.  But instead it looks like this.,BENDER
7665,FRY,Who would do a thing like that?,FRY
7666,BENDER,"Who could do a thing like that? And by ""that"", I mean this.",BENDER
7672,LEELA,My God! Even the Professor's been bent.,LEELA
7673,FARNSWORTH,"That you for your sympathy, talking square of linoleum.",FARNSWORTH
7674,BENDER,I'll get you fixed up.  That's fine.,BENDER
7680,BENDER,"Oh, I see. A bunch of stuff gets bent so it must be the robot designed for bending.",BENDER
7687,BENDER,"See? Nothing. Told you, losers.",BENDER
7688,FRY,Wait! There on the screen. It's that guy you are.,FRY
7690,FARNSWORTH,Dear God! We've got robots on the ceiling.,FARNSWORTH
7691,FRY,You weren't sleepwalking. You were sleep-bending!,FRY
7692,BENDER,"This is quite a shock. On the other hand, it's not surprising in the least. After all, I've been bending since the day I was built.",BENDER
7693,BENDER,(voice-over) I was born on an assembly line in the bad part of Tijuana.,BENDER
7694,BENDER,"Mama.  Hooray! I graduated! Time to bend around Europe for a few months, then get a job bending.",BENDER
7696,BENDER,Sure. It was only four years ago.,BENDER
7697,FRY,You're only four years old?,FRY
7698,BENDER,"Precocious little scamp, ain't I?",BENDER
7699,LEELA,Hmm. Bender must have a pent-up need to bend that's not being satisfied by his bend-free lifestyle.,LEELA
7700,FARNSWORTH,Then he can't stay here. He's a menace to every straight person in the company. Go satisfy your bend lust and don't you come back to work until you do.,FARNSWORTH
7708,BENDER,"Aw, no! A strike? Now I'll never get to bend anything. Oh, woe is Bender.",BENDER
7712,BENDER,Ten-times normal wage?  I'll give those jerks what for!,BENDER
7718,BENDER,"Hey, sorry you got sent to that South American Turkish prison instead of me on account of mistaken identity.",BENDER
7726,BENDER,"Ow!  Um. Hi, Angleyne. Whatcha up to?",BENDER
7728,BENDER,"That's cool, that's cool. So, um, uh, I was wondering if, y'know, it's cool if not, but, what are you doing after work?",BENDER
7730,BENDER,"Me too.  Man, we have a lot in common, huh?",BENDER
7732,BENDER,(sexfully) Are you sure? Maybe I should sneak a peek at your access panel.,BENDER
7736,FARNSWORTH,"What an exquisite day. That azure sky, the verdant treetops.  Those delightful birds with their chirp, chirp, chirp and their tweet, tweet, splat.",FARNSWORTH
7737,FRY,"Professor, I've never seen you so cheerful. What the hell's wrong with you?",FRY
7738,FARNSWORTH,"Hmm. I'm not quite sure. Perhaps seeing things from a new perspective has reminded me of life's beauty. Or perhaps my new posture is causing blood to pool in the back of my brain, resulting in a mild delirium. Incidentally, you have a dime up your nose.",FARNSWORTH
7740,BENDER,Union forever! Lousy scabs! They can't do those things! Et cetera!,BENDER
7741,BENDER,I bet watching me bend girders like this turns your legs all rubbery.,BENDER
7743,BENDER,"Oh, yeah?  Prove it.  Here, let me help you.",BENDER
7744,FARNSWORTH,My new bent outlook has completely re-energised me. I'm even dating a young Brazilian retired actress.,FARNSWORTH
7746,FARNSWORTH,Some say I'm robbing the cradle but I say she's robbing the grave.,FARNSWORTH
7747,BENDER,"Howdy, doodies. What's new?",BENDER
7748,FARNSWORTH,"I was just regaling your former co-workers with a tale of bedroom antics, the likes of which--",FARNSWORTH
7749,BENDER,"Yeah, yeah! Big whoop! No-one cares. I got Bender-related news. I'm in love and I'm taking all my friends out to celebrate.",BENDER
7752,BENDER,"Oh, Elzar, you'll never guess what's happened?",BENDER
7754,BENDER,I met the most dynamite ladybot.,BENDER
7757,FARNSWORTH,"So, Bender, tell us about this new girlfriend of yours.",FARNSWORTH
7758,BENDER,"I intend to. Through the lost art of the toast.  To Angleyne, she's got it all. Looks, charm and the love of a fabulous bending robot.",BENDER
7762,BENDER,"I finally meet a nice girl with a pair of legs that don't quit unexpectedly and that jerk Flexo steals her away? It's time to kick some shiny, metal ass.  You degenerate hussy! I'm disappointed in you too, Angleyne.",BENDER
7764,BENDER,"Oh, God! Then it's worse than I think.",BENDER
7768,BENDER,"Uh, I knew that. What I'm actually outraged by is your choice of wine. Really, it's the steward's fault.",BENDER
7770,BENDER,"(muttering) That Flexo, I'm knockin' him right on his butt. I can't believe this.",BENDER
7771,FARNSWORTH,"Obsessing won't help, Bender. Take a lean back and enjoy life.",FARNSWORTH
7772,BENDER,I can't. My Fembot may be in love with another Manbot.,BENDER
7773,LEELA,Well talk to her. Tell her about your feelings in an open an honest way.,LEELA
7774,FRY,Yeah. Either that or be a man.,FRY
7775,BENDER,"OK, I've constructed an elaborate lie: I'll call Angleyne while pretending to be Flexo, arrange a date, show up disguised as him and catch her two-timing me with myself.",BENDER
7776,FRY,That's thinkin' like a man.,FRY
7777,BENDER,(disguised voice) Hello? This is Flexo.,BENDER
7778,BENDER,Now we'll see who loves whom.,BENDER
7781,BENDER,"Nonsense. It's exactly like me. Flexo: The fun loving love machine Fembots love to love. Hey, barkeep, I'll have a Fuzzy Navel and she'll have the girliest drink in the house.",BENDER
7783,BENDER,I hope they can make change for a fortune.,BENDER
7788,BENDER,You're lookin' good to Flexo tonight.,BENDER
7790,BENDER,Bender? That walking wuss factory?,BENDER
7792,BENDER,"But going through a divorce together, you can't tell me that didn't bring us closer. Care to dance?",BENDER
7794,BENDER,"In that case it's something I've always wanted to make up to you.  Hey, scratchmo. How 'bout dropping me and the lady some rump-rattling beats?",BENDER
7797,BENDER,I recently upgraded my funk card. C'mon!,BENDER
7799,BENDER,"C'mon now, what's new!  Ew!",BENDER
7803,BENDER,"So the moral of the story is: If you want it to stay sunk, tie a weight to it!",BENDER
7805,BENDER,"Aw, shucks, thunder-buns! You make me feel like a million volts.",BENDER
7807,BENDER,"(thinking) So, she's falling for Flexo, eh? I'd better seduce her a little more, just to be sure.",BENDER
7809,BENDER,"I'll walk you out. After all, a true gentleman tends to his date's every need.  Tiparillo?",BENDER
7810,BENDER,"Here you are, my lad. Bring the lady's car around in the finest way possible.",BENDER
7817,BENDER,How 'bout a lift? To your place.,BENDER
7819,BENDER,Admit it. You felt something for me tonight. And by me I mean Flexo.,BENDER
7825,BENDER,"That's right, baby. I ain't your lover boy, Flexo, the guy you love so much. You even love anybody pretending to be him.",BENDER
7827,BENDER,"Oh, how I wish I could believe or understand that! There's only one reasonable course of action now: Kill Flexo.  Ow!",BENDER
7830,BENDER,You call yourself divorced? You're making a mockery of one of our oldest institutions.,BENDER
7836,BENDER,Probably not. But I love you And I'm gonna kick his ass 'til I win you back.,BENDER
7844,BENDER,"But ... but ...  I love you so much, Angleyne, I want you to be happy no matter what.",BENDER
7846,BENDER,I'm saying I've got an unbendable girder to bend.,BENDER
7848,BENDER,"Well I don't know anything about lifting, so that just leaves us the one option.",BENDER
7851,BENDER,(crying) Me too. Me too. (talking) Jerk.,BENDER
7852,LEELA,"So Flexo and Angleyne had sex right there on the factory floor? Well, at least you got bending out of your system.",LEELA
7853,BENDER,"Yes. I won't be up to bending again for a long, long time.",BENDER
7854,FARNSWORTH,Perhaps it's your outlook that needs a good bend. A 90-degree bend to a place where happiness is perpendicular to wonderment.,FARNSWORTH
7855,FRY,"Professor, we're all sick of your upbeat attitude.",FRY
7858,FARNSWORTH,Nonsense. It's just like in the song I wrote:,FARNSWORTH
7859,LEELA,"Bender, you've gotta help us.",LEELA
7860,BENDER,I try to get out but they keep pulling me back in.,BENDER
7861,FARNSWORTH,"(singing) You gotta dangle,",FARNSWORTH
7863,BENDER,I like him better this way.,BENDER
7869,LEELA,He ought to be with all the strict training I've been putting him through.  Nibbler: Roll over and you get a ham.  Roll over. Roll over for the ham.  You are so adorable! Who wants a ham?,LEELA
7870,FARNSWORTH,Zooka barooka! First prize is $500 and a year's supply of dog food!,FARNSWORTH
7873,FRY,"Man, that's dog's gonna be hard to beat. Look at him bring in the sheep! One sheep, two sheep......three sheep.",FRY
7874,LEELA,"The dog's good, but our real competition is the Hypno-Toad.  Your turn, Nibbler, honey. Herd those sheep!",LEELA
7876,BENDER,"Ma'am, I have a late entry.  My hard-shelled wooping terrier, Mr. Zoidberg.",BENDER
7879,BENDER,Suck in that gut! You wanna be spayed?,BENDER
7880,BENDER,"Silence, you cur! Puff out that brisket!",BENDER
7881,BENDER,I should be weeping! I'm not weeping!,BENDER
7883,LEELA,"Shake paws, Nibbler. Come on, shake. He might be a little hungry. Shake, boy. Usually he's had more ham by now. Shake!",LEELA
7885,BENDER,Second place?  That's a fancy word for losing.  You didn't stick your landing!,BENDER
7889,LEELA,Me? Award? Him? Me? Good?,LEELA
7891,LEELA,Maybe they're right. Maybe Nibbler is dumb.,LEELA
7892,FRY,"Don't listen to them, Leela. People said I was dumb, but I proved them.",FRY
7893,FARNSWORTH,"Good news, everyone. We were supposed to make a delivery to the planet Tweenis 12 but it's been completely destroyed.",FARNSWORTH
7898,FRY,Looks like this planet is next in line.,FRY
7899,LEELA,That's Earth.  The planet we live on.,LEELA
7900,FRY,I'd hate to be those guys.,FRY
7903,LEELA,"(shouting) No! Nibbler, come back!",LEELA
7904,LEELA,"Too bad Nibbler's not around. I guess I'll have to eat this raw, dripping ham by myself.  Nibbler?  Nibbler, you're scaring me.  Nibbler?!  Am I going crazy? Have my years of wild hedonism finally caught up with me?  Nibbler, help! Don't leave me here.  Uh, Nibbler? Could you scooch the seat up just a little bit?",LEELA
7906,BENDER,"Fry, help me! My heart stopped beating!",BENDER
7907,FRY,You don't have a heart; you're a robot.,FRY
7908,BENDER,"Sure...right. Robot!  Oh, Fry! My skin's all dry and clanky.",BENDER
7909,FRY,"Well, yeah. Robots are made of metal.",FRY
7911,FRY,"Bender, if this is some kind of scam, I don't get it. You already have my power of attorney.",FRY
7913,FARNSWORTH,Ow. Ow. Ow.  I'm a genius. Ow. Ow.,FARNSWORTH
7914,FRY,Dr. Zoidberg? Why is everyone acting so weird?,FRY
7916,FRY,(angry) I just let you back in!,FRY
7917,LEELA,"This is unbelievable. I thought you were a furry little moron. But here you are flying an adorable spaceship. If only you could talk.  Wait! I understood that!  You say you're transmitting your thoughts directly to my brain.  You say those awful flying brains are making everyone on Earth stupid?  Oh, stupider. And you go on to say that we're headed for your home planet where your race has lived since the beginning of the universe?  So, how did the universe begin?  Then the meaning of existence...? So every religion is wrong!",LEELA
7924,FRY,"Man, even the news monster is acting strange. What are we gonna do?",FRY
7925,FARNSWORTH,"Duh, I know! Let's play the lottery!",FARNSWORTH
7929,FRY,Wait a minute! I know what's going on here. You've all become idiots!,FRY
7930,BENDER,"Hey, let's all join the Reform Party!",BENDER
7937,LEELA,"So, your real name is Lord Nibbler? That's a coincidence.",LEELA
7939,LEELA,"Oh, you're all so cute!",LEELA
7945,LEELA,"So why are these Brain Spawn attacking Earth, Nibbler?",LEELA
7948,LEELA,Wipe out all thought? My God! They're like flying televisions.,LEELA
7951,LEELA,"Now, when you say ""special""...",LEELA
7952,FRY,Attention New New Yorkers. Stop acting so stupid!,FRY
7954,LEELA,Why would Fry be immune to the flying brains? Because he doesn't shower?,LEELA
7958,LEELA,Like a prom dress made from carpet remnants.,LEELA
7966,FRY,"Time to re-educate you duncebags. We'll start with US presidents.  This is our first president, George Washington. Let's review. Who was our first president?",FRY
7970,FRY,Leela! I've been so worried. Are you a bonehead?,FRY
7971,LEELA,I...have to tell...must...important...something...,LEELA
7972,FRY,"Whoa, whoa! Slow down. You're going a mile a minute.",FRY
7976,FARNSWORTH,The professy will help!  Fire indeed hot!,FARNSWORTH
7978,LEELA,Brain. Brain make people dumb.,LEELA
7979,FRY,"No, Leela. Brain make people smart.",FRY
7980,LEELA,You go fight biggest brain of all.,LEELA
7981,FRY,Even bigger than those? Holy nuts! Where is it?,FRY
7983,FRY,Hm. A giant brain is basically a giant nerd. And where would a giant nerd be? The libary!,FRY
7985,FRY,I'm here to kick your ass.,FRY
7987,FRY,"That's right. And I think you'll find that a little knowledge is a dangerous thing!  OK, better think of a new plan. Come on, Fry, think!  Thinking...thinking...",FRY
7989,FRY,"Hey! Thinking hurts him. Maybe I can think of a way to use that.  Aha! Prepare to be thought at. Leela, give me a topic.",FRY
7991,FRY,"Seriously, I can't think of anything. Gotta find something to make me think. (reading) Hardy Boys. (talking) Too easy. (reading) Nancy Drew. (talking) Too hard. Aha! Perfect! Bonfire of the Vanities!",FRY
7996,FRY,Take that! And that! This sentence I don't understand but take this one!,FRY
8004,FRY,"Queequeg, let go of me! I have to kill it!",FRY
8006,FRY,Follow him! It's our only way out!,FRY
8007,FRY,"Excuse me, have you seen a giant brain?",FRY
8013,FRY,Tou think I'm an oddity? Wait'l you see --,FRY
8020,FRY,"Hey, Brain-y, think fast!",FRY
8023,FRY,"Leela, I've got an idea. Stay here with Queequeg.",FRY
8024,LEELA,Is there Mrs. Queequeg?,LEELA
8025,FRY,"Yes! I'm free!  Alright, Brain. Get ready for some electroshock treatment!",FRY
8026,LEELA,"Fry, don't die! Wake up!  (screaming) Nooo!",LEELA
8027,FRY,"Leela cried for her lost love as Fry lay dead under the heavy bookcase. The Big Brain laughed in triumph......Then, for no reason, he left Earth forever. The end.  There!  Now he's trapped in a book I wrote: A crummy world of plot holes and spelling errors.",FRY
8030,LEELA,Me...feel...a bit better in cognitive faculties.,LEELA
8031,FRY,I did it!  And it's all thanks to the books at my local library.,FRY
8035,LEELA,Time for a diapee change!,LEELA
8043,BENDER,"(cheering) Alright, Zoidberg!",BENDER
8052,LEELA,(awestruck) Your uncle was Harold Zoid?,LEELA
8054,FARNSWORTH,"Why, I've been a Harold Zoid fan since back when my hips were made of bone. As it happens, I still have some of my original 78s.",FARNSWORTH
8066,BENDER,"Oh, I am, me!  Bender is!",BENDER
8070,BENDER,"No, I'm Bender. We met once, remember?",BENDER
8072,BENDER,"Come on, don't you remember how much I was bugging you, don't you? 'Cause it was a lot, you remember, right?",BENDER
8074,BENDER,Bender? That was the other guy. My name's Boiler.,BENDER
8076,BENDER,Thanks. And call me Bender.,BENDER
8095,FRY,He promised he'd give his Uncle Zoid a million bucks to make a movie.,FRY
8097,BENDER,"(proud) Well, perhaps I could call on TVs Calculon to help, now that I'm in showbiz.",BENDER
8098,FRY,Since when have you been in the biz?,FRY
8099,BENDER,"Long enough, little man. Long enough.",BENDER
8100,BENDER,"Calculon, as your hot water heater......I would be remiss if I didn't bring you scripts that could make you an international film star.",BENDER
8104,BENDER,"Get this: For a scant $1 million investment, you can be the star.",BENDER
8106,BENDER,"And, uh, I guarantee it'll win you an Oscar.",BENDER
8110,BENDER,I can guarantee anything you want.,BENDER
8113,BENDER,Here's your chequebook.,BENDER
8116,BENDER,"(to Calculon) That plot makes perfect sense, wink wink.",BENDER
8118,BENDER,"No, I didn't. (quietly) Raise middle finger.",BENDER
8131,BENDER,"Nice turnout, Calculon. That Oscar's practically on your mantel.",BENDER
8135,FRY,"Leela, we're missing the premiere. My only goal in life was to attend a Hollywood shindig. Just pay the valet the two bucks.",FRY
8136,LEELA,"No! It's the principle of the thing. Besides, I think I see a parking lot up ahead.",LEELA
8144,BENDER,(cheering) Woohoo! Yeah! He's a visionary!,BENDER
8146,BENDER,"Now you know why I use the qualifier, ""practically"".",BENDER
8152,BENDER,Then maybe you should act better.,BENDER
8156,LEELA,"It's no use. The tar is too thick. Plus, I think I flooded it.",LEELA
8157,FRY,"Well, we missed the premiere and we're gonna die. We might as well enjoy the sights.  Oh my God, Sylvester Stallone!",FRY
8160,BENDER,Calculon's gonna kill us for sure. It's all everybody else's fault.,BENDER
8172,FRY,It's been two weeks. You wanna play tic-tac-toe again before we eat our shoes?,FRY
8173,LEELA,"Oh, I always knew I'd die at the bottom of a pit. But a pit full of tar?",LEELA
8174,FRY,What was that? A tar dolphin or a tar shark?,FRY
8175,LEELA,"It's some kind of hollow tube, devoid of human life.  The Los Angeles subway! We can blast our way in and escape!",LEELA
8176,FRY,"Alright, but I still feel like having a shoe.",FRY
8178,BENDER,They're giving out the minor technical awards. I think they're up to writing.,BENDER
8182,BENDER,"And now, to present the award for Best Actor......a bit player in the flop movie The Magnificent Three......Dr. Zoidberg.",BENDER
8196,BENDER,"Then you're not going to kill us, Your Majesty?",BENDER
8201,FRY,We made it! I'm at a Hollywood party!,FRY
8205,LEELA,"Fry, I know those cookies are fresh-a-licious but they produce an awful lot of trash.",LEELA
8207,LEELA,"And Bender, that aerosol head spray makes your head smell nice...",LEELA
8209,LEELA,...but it's doing long-term damage to the planet.,LEELA
8210,BENDER,So? It's not like it's the only one we've got!,BENDER
8211,FARNSWORTH,Good news everyone! I'm sending you on an extremely controversial mission!,FARNSWORTH
8214,FARNSWORTH,"For this highly controversial mission, you'll be towing the Juan Valdez, an orbitting supertanker full of rich Columbian dark matter.",FARNSWORTH
8215,LEELA,Dark matter oil? What if we hit something? The tanker could leak!,LEELA
8216,FARNSWORTH,"Impossible!  The tanker has 6000 hulls. So, unlike me, it's entirely leak-proof! Now, once you've hauled the tanker past the protestors -",FARNSWORTH
8219,LEELA,Why do we have to fly within three feet of this penguin preserve on Pluto?,LEELA
8220,FARNSWORTH,(whispering) To avoid the tollbooth.,FARNSWORTH
8221,FRY,"Alright, she's all restocked with emergency jam. Let's get going.",FRY
8222,LEELA,"At the risk of sounding negative: No! Look Professor, I can't participate in this mission.",LEELA
8223,FARNSWORTH,What are you yapping about?,FARNSWORTH
8224,LEELA,"This time it's your reckless disregard for the environment. In fact, I'm gonna go join those protestors.",LEELA
8225,FARNSWORTH,This is an outrage. I demand that you hand over your captain's jacket.,FARNSWORTH
8226,LEELA,This is my normal jacket. I've had it for 10 years.,LEELA
8227,FARNSWORTH,"I said hand it over!  Well Fry, or should I say Captain Fry?  No I shouldn't. Because Bender is the new captain!",FARNSWORTH
8229,FARNSWORTH,"That's right. Being a captain is about intuition and heart. A good captain can't have either one. That's why cold, logical Bender is perfect for the job.",FARNSWORTH
8230,BENDER,"Well, I do think of human life as expendable.",BENDER
8231,FRY,No fair. Leela was training me to be captain. She even let me sit in her lap and steer - in this comic I drew.,FRY
8233,BENDER,"Fry, the title of captain may inflate the human ego, but it's beneath the notice of my mighty robo-logic!  Now look spry men! We launch at six bells!",BENDER
8235,LEELA,Why do we have to resort to non-violence? Can't we just kick their asses?,LEELA
8237,BENDER,Aye! We're hitched up tighter than Davy Jones' U-Haul! At ease men!,BENDER
8239,BENDER,"Mr Fry. I like to give my first mate an informal nickname. From now on, you will be known as...Wiggles!",BENDER
8241,BENDER,I have now. And what's Peter Parrot's first rule of captaining?,BENDER
8243,BENDER,Correct Wiggles. You've just earned an invitation to the captain's table.,BENDER
8250,LEELA,"When you were planning this peace ring, didn't you realise spaceships can move in three dimensions?",LEELA
8254,LEELA,Aww they're so cute! They're like if puppies and kittens could have babies!,LEELA
8257,BENDER,"...But I suppose it's this medal I'm most proud of Wiggles. I won it for saving the children of Earth from a giant kangaroo. It was on the Australian news, you probably didn't see it.",BENDER
8259,FRY,Would you cram a sock in it Bender? Those aren't even medals! They're bottlecaps and pepperoni slices.,FRY
8260,BENDER,Thank you steward. Wiggles? Weren't you about to propose a toast to your gallant captain?,BENDER
8261,FRY,"Fine, I've got a toast. To Captain Bender! He's the best......at being a big jerk and his big ugly face is as dumb as a butt.",FRY
8263,FRY,If I were in charge I wouldn't treat you like this. You're nothing but a big blowhard.,FRY
8264,BENDER,"Sir, you forget yourself! Shut up!",BENDER
8265,FRY,Being captain is obviously more important to you than being my friend. I'm going.,FRY
8266,BENDER,"Going? But, a captain can't drink without his first mate!",BENDER
8268,BENDER,I don't feel like drinking.,BENDER
8270,BENDER,"(soberly singing) Oh Greenland is a barren land, a land that bears no green. Where there's ice and snow and the whale fishies blow and the -",BENDER
8272,BENDER,Gah! I once knew a guy...you look like him. But he wasn't either.  I'm a good captain.,BENDER
8275,LEELA,Bender's flying too low! And he's upside-down!,LEELA
8279,FRY,Oh the fools! If only they'd built it with 6001 hulls! When will they learn?,FRY
8281,LEELA [ON TV],"I don't think any of those poor, oil-drenched penguins feel.",LEELA
8284,BENDER,Five hours? Aw man! Couldn't you have just gotten me the death penalty?,BENDER
8286,BENDER,"Yeah, uh, good luck with that.",BENDER
8287,LEELA,Now you stay away from those puffin twins.,LEELA
8289,LEELA,Uh...I think I'll go check on Bender.,LEELA
8291,BENDER,"Ah, can't beat fresh squeezed!",BENDER
8292,LEELA,"Bender, can you at least pretend you're being punished?  And clean the black parts too.",LEELA
8295,BENDER,"Yo, screws, more Tegrin over here? Oh ho, what's this?",BENDER
8299,LEELA,Has anyone seen Bender? (shouting) Bender? Here robot robot robot.,LEELA
8300,LEELA,"Hey, why weren't you Kong donkeys outside cleaning up?",LEELA
8302,FRY,"You ate most of them. So, where's Captain Bender? Off catastrophising some other planet?",FRY
8304,LEELA,I'm worried about him. He didn't come back with the group.,LEELA
8306,LEELA,No. And with windchill it's 20 degrees below absolute zero. I'd better go find him.,LEELA
8307,FRY,"Wait. Let me. Bender and I have our disagreements, but we're still friends and I'm gonna show him what that means. To the ship.",FRY
8308,LEELA,Why don't you just walk? He was only about 20 yards from here.,LEELA
8309,FRY,"Madam, I am in command now.",FRY
8311,BENDER,What the?  What's this water made of? Ice? Forget this!,BENDER
8313,BENDER,(in penguin) Not entirely.,BENDER
8316,FRY,Then where are we? You said you knew how to navigate.,FRY
8323,LEELA,"Oh if only we hadn't flown penguins to Pluto and dumped oil on them, this might never have happened. Can't we stop them from multiplying?",LEELA
8325,LEELA,What is it? We'll do anything.,LEELA
8327,LEELA,You can't shoot penguins. Isn't there some way to prevent them from breeding?,LEELA
8329,LEELA,"Well...I suppose...but...I mean...I joined Penguins Unlimited to love penguins, not to hunt them.",LEELA
8331,LEELA,(crying) Oh God it's inhuman! It's like Hong Kong! I'll do it!,LEELA
8335,LEELA,"Hey, you're enjoying this.",LEELA
8337,LEELA,I'm sorry but if it's fun in any way it's not environmentalism.,LEELA
8342,LEELA,"Alright, this is for their own good. Don't leave orphans. Gotta kill entire families.  But they're so cute. No! You can do this. It's just like murdering a little butler. I...I can't look. (crying) Oh no! What have I done?  Oh you poor little guy! I'm so sorry I - Bender?  What's going on? Were you hiding out with these little guys?",LEELA
8343,BENDER,Of course not. Filthy ice rats. Scat! Shoo!  Gah! What are you doing? Get away!,BENDER
8345,BENDER,"Well I don't love them.  Aww!  I don't know why but when I look down at their little faces, it makes me wanna puke! In a good way!",BENDER
8347,BENDER,(in penguin) That's Puffin talk. Now follow me!,BENDER
8348,LEELA,"Stop! Stop shooting! It's me, Leela.",LEELA
8353,LEELA,"Look, I don't know if shooting penguins will help the environment or not. But I do know that the decision shouldn't be in the hands of people who just wanna kill for fun.",LEELA
8360,BENDER,(in penguin) We will fight them on the beaches! We will fight them on the glaciers!,BENDER
8363,LEELA,They used to be such peaceful birds. I suppose this was your doing.,LEELA
8364,BENDER,"Yep. It's like I taught 'em. If it ain't black and white - peck scratch and bite! Now to take off my tuxedo.  Guys, it's me! Your lovable dictator! Uh-oh!",BENDER
8365,LEELA,"Oh, if only we had a toboggan.",LEELA
8368,BENDER,Oh phew!  Oh right they can swim. It's all coming back to me now.,BENDER
8371,LEELA,"Well, at least it'll help reduce their population.",LEELA
8372,BENDER,"Yeah, life is hilariously cruel.  Permission to come aboard Wiggles?",BENDER
8373,FRY,Granted. We can't take off without our captain.,FRY
8374,BENDER,"Oh, and bring my toboggan.",BENDER
8375,FRY,"So Leela, were you able to help the penguins?",FRY
8376,LEELA,Well sure. I mean...not really...I mean...nature will work itself out. It can't screw things up any worse than we did trying to fix things right?,LEELA
8378,BENDER,"Ah, quit your worrying. Thanks to my shining influence those stupid birds'll do just fine.",BENDER
8401,FARNSWORTH,No fair! You changed the outcome by measuring it.,FARNSWORTH
8403,FRY,I'll tell you when my horse finishes...bad.,FRY
8407,BENDER,Ooo look! It's the centaur race!,BENDER
8408,FRY,"Come on, come on! Hey Leela, how 'bout a kiss for good luck?  I meant tongue luck.",FRY
8409,FRY,I am so unlucky! I've run over black cats that were luckier than me.,FRY
8414,LEELA,I'll have a cholesterol free omelette with horse beaters.,LEELA
8421,FRY,"Dear Horse God, I know I don't usually pray to you, sometimes I doubt you even exist. But if you're willing to grant me luck, please, stamp your hoof once. Come on number six move it!  Don't do that! What are you -  Man it's contagious!",FRY
8422,BENDER,That'll teach those other horses to take drugs!,BENDER
8423,FRY,"That's it! You can only take my money for so long before you take it all, and I say enough.  I've got one dollar left, and this one I'm holding onto! Oh no you don't!  I may not know much about horses but I know a lot about doing anything for one dollar!  If you think bad luck can defeat me then you don't know my name is Philip J -",FRY
8425,FRY,Kareem's got the skyhook but Philip J. Fry's got the spacehook!,FRY
8427,FRY,Hey. That's my patented spacehook! You stole it!,FRY
8429,FRY,Holy camolie! A seven leaf clover!,FRY
8431,FRY,Phil wins! Yancy's fans are stunned! There'll be no celebration at the Yancy dome!,FRY
8433,LEELA,Well someone's in a good mode.,LEELA
8434,BENDER,Let's just say I lucked out at the track! Also I rigged one race.,BENDER
8435,FRY,Pah. I'd have won a lot of money too if I still had my lucky seven leaf clover. Plus I'd still have my hair.,FRY
8438,FRY,I hid it in a secret hiding place who's location I never told anyone. Not even Scruffy.,FRY
8440,FRY,Hey yeah! Maybe it is still there! Underground in the ruins of Old New York. Helping some ant defeat another ant or helping some piece of dirt turn it's luck around.,FRY
8441,FARNSWORTH,Dirt doesn't need luck.,FARNSWORTH
8442,FRY,I'm going down there to get my clover back. Now some of the tunnels have metal bars so I'll need someone who's good at bending. Leela how 'bout you?,FRY
8444,BENDER,Like hell you will. Bending's my middle name.,BENDER
8446,BENDER,Yep. My full name is Bender Bending Rodriguez,BENDER
8447,FRY,Here's the entrance.  From this moment on I declare my bad luck officially over.,FRY
8449,LEELA,Well if we get bored I've got Tetris on this thing.,LEELA
8451,BENDER,Old New York. The city that inspired a casino in Las Vegas.,BENDER
8452,FRY,"Wow! We've got Manhattan all to ourselves! I can finally do all the crazy stuff I always dreamed of doing!  Howard Stern s overrated!  Uh, oops!",FRY
8454,FRY,And remember when Mayor Giuliani cracked down on jaywalking?,FRY
8456,FRY,"Well Rudy, how'd you like this action?",FRY
8462,FRY,The moonwalk...the robot...the zero,FRY
8472,FRY,The robot? That's similar to mine!,FRY
8474,FRY,What are you doing? You totally ripped off my routine.,FRY
8476,FRY,Why do you always have to steal everything from me Yancy? Find your own life and live it.,FRY
8478,FRY,Well I'd like to see you try and steal this. the septuple head spin.,FRY
8480,FRY,"Oh yeah? Noticeably F.A.T., rewind the tape.",FRY
8486,FRY,"Alright team, let's go find that clover!",FRY
8487,LEELA,Which way to your house? The sign says we're at 71st street.,LEELA
8488,FRY,"71st street? Hmm, never heard of it. Downtown could be in any direction.",FRY
8489,BENDER,"No sweat, we'll just take a spin on the B-train!",BENDER
8490,BENDER,Ooo that feels funny!  This is the Brooklyn bound B-train making local stops at wherever the hell I feel like. Watch for the closing doors.,BENDER
8491,BENDER,Wake up buddy end of the line!,BENDER
8492,FRY,"Gosh my old neighbourhood!  That's the bench where I found some shirts!  That fire hydrant! In summer we'd light it on fire! On that corner, some guy with a bushy beard handed out a socialist newsletter!",FRY
8494,FRY,You'd better believe it!,FRY
8495,LEELA,"The old comedians were right, this place is a lot different from LA!",LEELA
8499,FRY,"Yeah, he was my neighbour. Why?",FRY
8501,FRY,Get out of here! What's Andy up to these days?,FRY
8505,FRY,Holy camolies! The house I grew up in! It's still there!,FRY
8506,BENDER,"Man, father time really took a bat to this place.",BENDER
8510,FRY,"Mom, Yancy's trying to steal my clover.",FRY
8514,FRY,Not yet commander. Yancy's just trying to steal my stuff as usual.,FRY
8516,FRY,The Ronco Record Vault! Yancy'll never get his hands on you in here or my money back.  Ah The Breakfast Club soundtrack! Man I can't wait til I'm old enough to feel ways about stuff!  Stay safe clover. I may need you again someday.,FRY
8517,FRY,This was the storage room. My dad spent years turning it into a bomb shelter.,FRY
8518,LEELA,And yet you guys never had a single nuclear war.,LEELA
8520,FRY,This is it! My Ronco Record Vault! I still remember the combination.  Three. It's stuck.,FRY
8521,BENDER,The Achilles heel of the Ronco design is it's structural resonance frequency. Allow me.  There we go!,BENDER
8522,FRY,Here it is. The Breakfast Club soundtrack.,FRY
8523,BENDER,You mean breakfast club sandwich?,BENDER
8524,FRY,I hid my seven leaf clover in this very record jacket so my brother Yancy wouldn't get it.  Here goes.  It's gone!  the whole place has been cleaned out! Yancy stole my clover! That thief!,FRY
8525,LEELA,How do you know it didn't disintergrate?,LEELA
8526,FRY,Everything else in here held up OK.,FRY
8527,BENDER,Except Sports by Huey Lewis.,BENDER
8528,FRY,I don't know why my brother hated me so much.,FRY
8529,LEELA,"Aw, brothers always fight. I'm sure deep down he loved you. He just never got a chance to say it before you got frozen.",LEELA
8530,FRY,You think? 'Cause I always kinda wished that -,FRY
8531,BENDER,Who is that God-like figure?,BENDER
8532,FRY,It's my brother Yancy! And there in his lapel - my seven leaf clover! I knew he stole it.,FRY
8533,LEELA,Hold the phone. If that's Yancy then why does the inscription read Philip J. Fry?,LEELA
8534,FRY,Wait a second! That's my name! Good Lord. He ditched his goofy name and stole mine!,FRY
8535,BENDER,"Apparently this brave adonis, this cadillac of men, was the first person on Mars.",BENDER
8536,FRY,"First person on Mars?? I should have been the first person on Mars! He stole my clover, he stole my name and he stole my life!  And now he broke my hand.",FRY
8538,FARNSWORTH,So you opened the record vault and the clover was gone?,FARNSWORTH
8539,BENDER,"Yep, nothing in there but all the best music of the 1980's in one amazing collection.",BENDER
8540,LEELA,"Survivor, Pat Benetar, The Scorpions. The list goes on.",LEELA
8541,FRY,That clover helped my ratfink brother steal my dream of going into space. Now I'll never get there.,FRY
8542,LEELA,You went there this morning for doughnuts.,LEELA
8544,FRY,I'm Philip J. Fry! He stole my name after I got frozen.,FRY
8545,FARNSWORTH,"Shut up friends. My internet browser heard us saying the word ""Fry"" and it found a movie about Philip J. Fry for us.  It alwso opened my calendar to Friday and ordered me some French fries.",FARNSWORTH
8546,FRY,That should have been me!,FRY
8547,FRY,That's my clover! Yancy stole it!,FRY
8548,FRY,That's what I'm known for!,FRY
8550,FRY,"So that's where my clover is? Hey, is that orbitting cemetary near here?",FRY
8551,LEELA,It will be in a couple hours.,LEELA
8552,FRY,"Good. Leela, Bender, we're going graverobbing.",FRY
8560,LEELA,They buried your brother in the world heroes section? I'm impressed.,LEELA
8561,FRY,I should be the one in that grave!,FRY
8563,BENDER,There. Now no one will be able to say I don't own John Larroquette's spine!,BENDER
8564,FRY,Aha! My brother's grave!,FRY
8565,LEELA,"(reading) Philip Fry, the original Martian.",LEELA
8566,FRY,"It's all lies every word of it! He wasn't original, he wasn't a Martian, he wasn't Philip Fry and since when is he a the?",FRY
8567,BENDER,You're twice the the he ever was.,BENDER
8573,FRY,"(reading) Here lies Philip J. Fry, named for his uncle, to carry on his spirit.",FRY
8574,BENDER,"Pay dirt! I got the clover! Plus his wedding ring.  Sorry ladies, I'm taken! Hey Fry you want me to smack the corpse up a little?",BENDER
8575,LEELA,"Uh, Bender, I think Fry needs a moment alone.",LEELA
8576,BENDER,Alright grab a shovel. I'm only one skull short of a Mouseketeer reunion.,BENDER
8580,LEELA,Could one of you guys get that?,LEELA
8581,LEELA,"It's a doorbell baby!  Hello, little guy. You know, I was abandoned as a baby too, so --",LEELA
8582,BENDER,"Garbage, huh? I'll take care of it.",BENDER
8583,LEELA,"Bender, stop! It's a baby!",LEELA
8585,LEELA,"Oh, it's just a card -- from the orphanarium I grew up in.",LEELA
8587,BENDER,"A reunion at your old orphanarium, eh? You gonna go?",BENDER
8588,LEELA,"No way, jose-bot. I never wanna see those other orphans again! Not after the way they used to pick on me.",LEELA
8591,LEELA,"How can you make fun of me, Kirk? You're blind!",LEELA
8593,FRY,"Aww. That's terrible, Leela. But imagine the look on their faces when you show up with two friends who eat all the hors d'oeuvres.",FRY
8594,LEELA,"Well, I wouldn't mind rubbing my success in a few choice faces.",LEELA
8595,BENDER,Set a course for adventure!,BENDER
8598,LEELA,Just like old times. Gosh. The bars on the windows seemed so much thicker back then.  Mr. Vogel? Remember me?,LEELA
8600,LEELA,You used to say that all the time!,LEELA
8602,FRY,Mmm! The gristle-in-a-blanket isn't half bad.,FRY
8603,BENDER,Mmm! And try one of these Popsicle sticks. They've absorbed quite a bit of flavour.,BENDER
8604,LEELA,"Hey, look. It's our old group picture.",LEELA
8605,FRY,I don't see you anywhere.,FRY
8606,LEELA,That's me over in Cootietown.,LEELA
8607,BENDER,Whoa! Get a load of this average-looking guy!,BENDER
8608,LEELA,That's Adlai Atkins. I used to have kind of a crush on him.,LEELA
8612,LEELA,"Well, it's time to say hello to the old gang.",LEELA
8616,LEELA,"And what am I up to, you ask? Well I'm a very successful space captain.",LEELA
8621,LEELA,Hey! You can't feel sorry for me! I'm a space captain and you're all a bunch of losers.,LEELA
8624,LEELA,"Oh, yeah? Well, shut up, cane boy!",LEELA
8627,LEELA,"Thanks, Adlai. I guess you never really outgrow being an eyeball -- oddball!",LEELA
8629,LEELA,"Well, you know. It's just for a package delivery service.",LEELA
8631,LEELA,Huh. I'd never thought of it that way. So what do you do these days?,LEELA
8633,LEELA,"A tall doctor, you say?",LEELA
8641,LEELA,You mean by beating them up? Because I've broken that blind kid's nose like 10 times and it doesn't make any difference.,LEELA
8644,BENDER,"Sons, daughters, meet Uncle Fry.",BENDER
8645,FRY,"Hey, why are those kids following you? Do you have candy stuck to your ass?",FRY
8646,BENDER,"No. It's called parenting. Come on, dumplings. We've got 12 government stipends to collect.",BENDER
8649,FARNSWORTH,Phaser eye surgery is a capital idea. I'm sure Leela's tired of morons gaping at her eye all the time.,FARNSWORTH
8651,FRY,You guys are crazy. Leela doesn't need surgery. You look great the way you are.,FRY
8652,LEELA,"Oh, that's so sweet, Fry. But for once in my life, I just wanna look normal.",LEELA
8653,FRY,"But you're better than normal, you're abnormal. If you ask me, you shouldn't care what other people think.",FRY
8654,LEELA,You're right! I'll start by not caring what you think!  I'm getting the surgery.,LEELA
8658,FARNSWORTH,That's the stupidest idea I've ever heard you imbecile!,FARNSWORTH
8661,FRY,Bah! I think she looked fine before.,FRY
8665,LEELA,"Wow, look at me. Although I don't have the hang of blinking yet.",LEELA
8673,LEELA,I've never felt so unremarkable! Today I actually blended in with a crowd!,LEELA
8674,BENDER,"Kids, meet the jerkbags I work with.",BENDER
8679,BENDER,"And from now on, you're all named Bender Jr.!  Looky here! My first government stipend cheque! 12 baby humans, 1200 wing-wangs!",BENDER
8681,BENDER,"What is it with you kids? Every other day, it's food, food, food!  Oh, fine. I'll get you some stupid food.",BENDER
8683,BENDER,No. The cat shelter's on to me!,BENDER
8685,LEELA,That's so handsome of you.,LEELA
8691,FRY,This is so unfair! I liked you back when you were a cyclops! That guy's only interested now that you have two eyes.,FRY
8693,FRY,"No, I'm not! Oh, wait, I am. But my point remains valid!",FRY
8694,LEELA,"Fry, I just wanna try dating a normal man, who if you go somewhere with him no one says he's crummy. I think I deserve that once in life.",LEELA
8696,LEELA,"Actually, most doctors are rich.",LEELA
8698,BENDER,"OK, they've got everything you need here: Booze, a couple of peanuts, they got a crapper in the back -- that's one of the things you kids do, right?",BENDER
8700,BENDER,Then knock yourself out.  Hey! Hey! Only eat enough to barely keep yourselves alive! I'm trying to make a profit here.,BENDER
8706,BENDER,"That's me, baby! Let me just ditch the kids in an alley and we can go have some fun.",BENDER
8708,BENDER,"Son, daddy's trying to score with a cheap floozy right now, so we need you to cram a Tinkertoy in it!",BENDER
8710,BENDER,"Hey, what the hell are you doing? Quit hugging me!",BENDER
8712,BENDER,You morons! I don't know what you're trying to pull here but I got half a mind to hug each and every one of you and see how you like it!,BENDER
8714,BENDER,"(grumbling) Oh, come on!",BENDER
8719,LEELA,"Oh, Adlai, I've had a wonderful time today. No one's stared at me or avoided staring at me or tried to burn me. You make me feel so not weird.",LEELA
8721,LEELA,Thanks for coming out to get to know my boyfriend. Isn't he dreamy?,LEELA
8725,FRY,What's so wonderful about Leela being normal? The rest of us aren't normal and that's what makes us great. Like Dr. Zoidberg: He's a weird monster who smells like he eats garbage and does.,FRY
8727,FRY,"And the professor's a senile, amoral crackpot.  Hermes is a Rastafarian accountant.",FRY
8729,FRY,Amy's a klutz from Mars.,FRY
8731,FARNSWORTH,"And Fry, you've got that brain thing.",FARNSWORTH
8732,FRY,"I already did! So, Leela, do you wanna be like us? Or do you wanna be like Adlai with no severe mental or social problems whatsoever?",FRY
8733,LEELA,That's the dumbest question I ever heard!,LEELA
8738,BENDER,"Coming through, watch your heads!",BENDER
8740,BENDER,"Remember your manners, kids. Forks go in the left pocket, spoons in the right.",BENDER
8743,BENDER,Ah-ah-ah! What do we say when someone gives you something?,BENDER
8748,BENDER,"Well you should've gone poopy before it was time to run out on the check! C'mon! Go, go! Through the kitchen!",BENDER
8753,LEELA,"Oh, Adlai, this is the most beautiful moment of my life!",LEELA
8755,BENDER,Daddy's tired. Let's just have another dog pile on Fry.,BENDER
8758,BENDER,"Alright, fine, gather round.",BENDER
8760,BENDER,"(reading) ""Bender's Arrest Record"" by the police. On March 3rd at 2pm, Bender was caught shoplifting!",BENDER
8762,BENDER,"OK, kids. It's 9:00, you know what that means. Daddy's sick of looking at you so go to bed.  The grown-ups have to talk. Come on, Ma.",BENDER
8763,BENDER,"Now to figure out how much money I'm raking in off those twerps!  Oh, I need a calculator.",BENDER
8765,BENDER,"I mean a good calculator. Minus the food, the bunny rabbit wallpaper -- I'm getting 100 bucks a kid and they're costing 110!",BENDER
8766,FRY,There goes my new kitchen cabinets.,FRY
8767,BENDER,I'm not sitting through one more PTA meeting. The kids have got to go!,BENDER
8769,BENDER,(shouting) Just go to bed!,BENDER
8771,LEELA,"Adlai, I was thinking. Since we're both orphans, maybe we should adopt a child.",LEELA
8773,BENDER,"Hello? Imperial Dragon Restaurant? I've got a herd of you-know-whats for sale...Let me check.  Oh, aren't you a cutie? About 35lbs.  What?!",BENDER
8774,LEELA,"Hi, Bender. We'd like to adopt a child.",LEELA
8775,BENDER,"Well, you've come to the right place because Honest Bender's Orphanarium means discount orphans. Now, little lady. What do I have to do to send you home with 12 orphans today?",BENDER
8777,BENDER,"Whatever you say, chief. I'll show you what I got in stock.",BENDER
8778,LEELA,I remember this from when we were kids: The warden would trot you out in front of prospective parents and they'd judge you like a piece of meat.,LEELA
8781,BENDER,Then how about this little number? Pure-bred human. No vampire in there.,BENDER
8784,BENDER,"If you're strapped for cash, you might wanna consider this irregular unit. Cursed with a third ear but so full of that emotion that I understand is called ""love"".",BENDER
8786,LEELA,"Oh, I can't decide. We're gonna have to think about it.",LEELA
8787,BENDER,"OK, kids, grown-ups gotta talk, time for bed.",BENDER
8790,LEELA,"Oh, they're all so adorable.",LEELA
8791,BENDER,"Yeah. You know, it's times like this I can hardly bear to let them go. Goodnight, you princes of Maine, you kings of New New England.",BENDER
8793,LEELA,"Officer, would it be alright if we adopted one of the kids?",LEELA
8798,LEELA,I've made up my mind. Let's adopt her.,LEELA
8800,LEELA,"Come on, Adlai. She could really use a mom and dad.",LEELA
8803,LEELA,Well? So what? She may be different but she still deserves a good home.,LEELA
8805,LEELA,She doesn't need an operation! She's fine the way she is!,LEELA
8809,LEELA,"Shut up, Fry. Now look, Adlai. I'm proud to be different. And I just wished I'd realised that when I was her age.",LEELA
8811,LEELA,Now take me to the hospital and put my eye back the way it was. Right now!,LEELA
8813,LEELA,"Listen, buddy. By the end of the day, one of us is going to have one eye.",LEELA
8815,FRY,It's good to have the old weird-looking Leela back.,FRY
8816,LEELA,"Aww! You're a true friend, Fry. I guess there's nothing wrong with being a little weird.",LEELA
8817,FRY,"Leela, there's nothing wrong with anything.",FRY
8821,BENDER,"Hey, I smoke a cigar, not a candy cane. Sheesh!  Hey, what the? Get away! Come on! I just got all the gum off of there! Hey! Hey! (shouting) I hate you! I hate you all!",BENDER
8825,FARNSWORTH,"Good news, everyone! Today marks our dear friend Dr. Zoidberg's 10th year with Planet Express. Huzzahs are in order.",FARNSWORTH
8826,FRY,(unenthusiastic) Huzzah!,FRY
8827,LEELA,(unenthusiastic) Huzzah!,LEELA
8834,FRY,"Oh, no, I'm boned! I haven't paid into the pension either. What'll I do when I retire?",FRY
8835,BENDER,I thought you were retired.,BENDER
8836,FRY,"Hey, I don't see you planning for your old age.",FRY
8837,BENDER,"I got plans. I'm gonna turn my on/off switch to ""off"".",BENDER
8838,FRY,Well I'm gonna take action. It's time to check on my retirement fund.  Damn! Still only $100.,FRY
8840,FRY,He's right! I've gotta start investing wisely.,FRY
8841,FRY,"Well, I'm down to my last lottery ticket. Cherry.  Cherry!  Mule. Crud!",FRY
8842,BENDER,"So, you got six bucks left to retire on. I recommend Tender Vittles.",BENDER
8844,FRY,(shrugging) You gotta spend money to make money.,FRY
8847,BENDER,That's for sure--  Roberto! Is that you?,BENDER
8849,BENDER,You old lunatic! How you been?,BENDER
8851,BENDER,"Yeah, I'm doing OK too.  I'm taking a Chinese cooking class at the Learning Annex.",BENDER
8855,BENDER,"Well, nice talking to you.",BENDER
8866,FRY,I sure do! That's the real robber and I'll never forget his name as long as I live. And that name is--,FRY
8867,LEELA,(shouting) Fry! Just give a name. You don't wanna look stupid on Court TV!,LEELA
8868,FRY,You're right. You're right. It was--,FRY
8872,FRY,I refuse to testify on the grounds that my organs will be chopped up into a patté.,FRY
8875,BENDER,A few months in an insane asylum? I could do that standing on my head.,BENDER
8880,BENDER,Yahoo! The system fails again!,BENDER
8884,FRY,(from box) Ow! My head! Ow! My feet! Ow! My head! Ow! My feet!,FRY
8886,FRY,(from box) Ow! My chin!,FRY
8887,FRY,"I don't belong here, Bender. This is an asylum for insane robots!",FRY
8888,BENDER,"Well, you meet half the qualifications.",BENDER
8889,FRY,"Oh, good, a physical! Once they examine my fragile, naked, pink body, they'll see I'm not a--",FRY
8891,BENDER,(shouting) I find that offensive!,BENDER
8893,FRY,"Look! There's been a terrible mistake. I'm a human being. See?  I'm all squishy and flabby. Also, I complain a lot.",FRY
8895,FRY,I do other human stuff! I age! See?,FRY
8898,FRY,The car dealer? Wow! I guess his prices really were insane.,FRY
8901,FRY,"Actually, we've met once before.",FRY
8904,BENDER,Whoa! Someone had a busy day.,BENDER
8905,FRY,"My roommate exploded. Oh, you gotta help me, Bender. How can I prove I'm human?",FRY
8906,BENDER,You could drop dead. That'd show 'em.,BENDER
8914,FRY,Let me guess: He thinks he's Lincoln?,FRY
8921,FRY,"Bender, I can't take much more of this! I want outta here!",FRY
8922,BENDER,"Are you crazy? This place is great! Electroshock whenever you want it, two Lincolns for every Napoleon.  Ah! Sweet light crude!",BENDER
8923,FRY,But I'm not a robot like you. I don't like having discs crammed into me. Unless they're Oreos - and then only in the mouth! Don't you understand? I'm gonna die here!,FRY
8924,BENDER,"Ah, quit your bellyaching and take it like a robot.",BENDER
8928,FRY,You gotta get me out of here. I would have starved to death if not for that sick vending machine robot.  Gimmie! Gimmie!,FRY
8930,LEELA,We're all trying to help you. We've petitioned the governor but he doesn't want to appear soft on people who've been falsely imprisoned.,LEELA
8931,FRY,At least I have friends on the outside. Bender's been no help at all.,FRY
8932,BENDER,"Je suis Napoleon!  No, seriously, I'm not.",BENDER
8934,BENDER,"Ah, lighten up, honey. I'm just trying to get through a difficult time using humour.",BENDER
8936,FRY,"(shouting) Help me! For God's sake, help me!",FRY
8937,FARNSWORTH,"Oh, don't worry, Fry. I too once spent a nightmare-ish time in a robot asylum. But now it's nearly over. So long.",FARNSWORTH
8938,FRY,"(sleep-talking) Thirty days hath September, April, June and ... wonder ... is that peanut butter ... what am I gonna do? (talking) Oh, God! What? What? What is it now?",FRY
8940,FRY,"Finally! Sweet justice! Sweet, juicy justice!",FRY
8947,FRY,Roberto! W-W-W-What are you doing here?,FRY
8949,FRY,Why would you hold up the same bank twice?,FRY
8953,FRY,No! Please! Help! Stop it! Please!,FRY
8954,BENDER,(shouting; from cell) Hey! Keep it down in there! I'm tuning my banjo!,BENDER
8956,FRY,I'm not a robot! (shouting) I'm not a robot!,FRY
8962,FRY,"(mechanical voice) Affirmative. I feel nothing. I am a robot. Beep, beep, beep ...",FRY
8963,LEELA,"You've made a terrible mistake. He's a human being, not a machine. Oh, Fry!",LEELA
8964,BENDER,"(singing) Gonna sing a little tale about a battle called Waterloo. (talking) Bonjour, y'all!",BENDER
8966,FRY,(mechanical voice) Negative. I must be a robot. Why else would human women refuse to date me?,FRY
8968,FRY,"(mechanical voice) Bio-units, terminate noise exchange. It is time for you to ingest sandwiches from my compartment.",FRY
8969,BENDER,Here we go. Just a minute. Aha!,BENDER
8973,BENDER,"Roberto! Ooh, what a surprise to see you in here! Especially 'cause I didn't squeal on you, remember? Remember all that squealing I didn't do? Remember? Do ya?",BENDER
8975,BENDER,"Uh, sure.  Anything for you, buddy.",BENDER
8977,BENDER,"Uh, what's with the get-up?",BENDER
8979,BENDER,I'm in! I'm in!  So when were you planning the breakout?,BENDER
8981,BENDER,Quick! Let's keep escaping!,BENDER
8983,FRY,"Oh, you sad, worthless human.",FRY
8985,FRY,Fear not! For I shall assist ye!,FRY
8987,FRY,"Relax, mammal. My robotic software shall meet your calculatory needs.  What is the meaning of this symbol?",FRY
8990,FRY,Stand back. I'm a tool-bot.,FRY
8991,LEELA,You're not a tool-bot. You're not a food-motron. You're not a robot of any kind.,LEELA
8992,FRY,"Yes, I am. I simply haven't discovered my primary function yet.",FRY
8993,LEELA,"OK, this has gotta stop. I'm going to remind Fry of his humanity the way only a woman can.",LEELA
8994,FARNSWORTH,You're going to do his laundry?,FARNSWORTH
8995,LEELA,"(sexfully) Fry, this is for you.",LEELA
8999,FRY,"(drunk) Alcohol fuels my power cells. And as a mighty robot, I--  Beep.",FRY
9004,BENDER,"Wow! Hitting the same place three times? I admire your style, Roberto.",BENDER
9008,BENDER,Come on! I got a place where I like to hide after crimes.,BENDER
9010,BENDER,"(panting) Hey, everybody. Meet my good pal, Roberto.",BENDER
9019,FARNSWORTH,Ouch! That's going to bleed when my heart beats.,FARNSWORTH
9025,BENDER,Um ... OK. Fixty ... six ... ish?,BENDER
9027,BENDER,Don't kill me yet! I'm starting to come down with Stockholm syndrome ... handsome!,BENDER
9030,FRY,"The side that kicks your twisted, metal ass!",FRY
9031,LEELA,Fry! Stay back. He's too powerful.,LEELA
9032,FRY,"Negative, bossy meat creature. I know now what my primary function is: I am a battle-droid. Sworn to protect the weak from crazy robots.",FRY
9036,FRY,No knife can penetrate my skin-tanium armour.,FRY

9045,FRY,"(mechanical voice) It was nothing. I-- (normal) Blood? Robots don't have blood. I must be a, a--",FRY
9047,FRY,"A human! Oh, my God! I'm a human!",FRY
9049,LEELA,"Thanks for saving us, Fry.",LEELA
9050,FRY,I'm gonna continue never washing this cheek again.,FRY
9051,BENDER,"Buddy, you may be wrapped in greasy skin, but inside, you've got the heart of a robot.",BENDER
9053,BENDER,"Just like inside me, I've got the heart of a human.  What?",BENDER
9057,BENDER,"(singing) Froggy went a-courtin' and he did ride, uh-huh, uh-huh",BENDER
9058,FRY,Oh my God! They dug up a bag of olestra chips from my time!  There must be layers and layers of old stuff down there.,FRY
9059,BENDER,What's that? One of those Led Zeppelins I've heard so much about?,BENDER
9060,FRY,"No, it's an old Volkswagen van.  (shouting) Hey, Mister? Mind if I take this old van?",FRY
9062,FRY,"Yeah yeah, I've gotten used cars before.",FRY
9063,LEELA,What's that? One of those Jefferson Starships I've heard so much about?,LEELA
9064,FRY,"It's called a van, and in light of the fact that it's not a-rockin', I invite you to come a-knockin'!",FRY
9068,FRY,"No, it can't, but it's got a driver's-side floor and an 8-track player with genuine mono sound.",FRY
9069,FARNSWORTH,Where's the device that lets you speed or slow the passage of time?,FARNSWORTH
9072,FRY,It just needs some gas.,FRY
9073,FARNSWORTH,"Wrong again, idiot. There is no gas. Petroleum reserves ran dry in 2038.",FARNSWORTH
9074,LEELA,"Gas was an environmental disaster, anyway. Now we use alternative fuels.",LEELA
9076,LEELA,"Whale oil.  Bender, lift it up to the can opener.",LEELA
9077,BENDER,"Oh, no, I'm not going near it. Last time, that magnetic psycho nearly cut my head off.",BENDER
9078,FRY,"Oh, right. Plus, the magnet screws up your inhibition unit and makes you sing folk songs.",FRY
9079,BENDER,What? Who said anything about me secretly wanting to be a folk singer? How ridiculous.,BENDER
9080,FRY,"Bender, if you don't open that can right now, your fear will own you, and nothing that can opener could ever do could be worse than that.",FRY
9081,BENDER,"OK, OK, I can do this. It's time to take life by the cans.",BENDER
9086,BENDER,(singing) Jimmy cracked corn and I don't care,BENDER
9088,BENDER,(singing) 'Cause the master's gone away.,BENDER
9090,BENDER,"Doc, I can't move my arms and legs. What's wrong with me?",BENDER
9096,FRY,"Oh, no, this is terrible.",FRY
9098,FARNSWORTH,"Well, let's drag him to the kerb.",FARNSWORTH
9099,FRY,"Wait a minute, Bender is my best friend. We can't just dump him in the gutter like Grandma's ashes.",FRY
9100,BENDER,"(crying) Oh, my life is over. I'll never know happiness again.",BENDER
9102,LEELA,"Look, Bender. It's Patch Cord Adams. He heals with the power of laughter.",LEELA
9104,BENDER,"Obviously not, or I'd be strangling you right now.",BENDER
9108,BENDER,"For the love of God, somebody kick his ass!",BENDER
9110,BENDER,"Oh, I'm doomed. Everybody leave me alone. I don't wanna be seen this way.",BENDER
9111,FRY,"Aw, you look so sad. You want me to send Patch Cord Adams back in?",FRY
9112,BENDER,"Hey, the blues. The tragic sound of other people suffering. That's kind of a pick-me-up.  Wow, that was great.",BENDER
9114,BENDER,"I dunno. Let me see.  Oh my God, you're Beck! I'd get up to shake your hand and steal your wallet but my crappy body crapped out on me.",BENDER
9116,BENDER,"Wow. We've sure got a lot in common, Beck. I always dreamed of being a musician-poet who transcends genres even as he re-invents them, just like you.",BENDER
9118,BENDER,"Eh, thanks, but it's hopeless. I'll never be a musician now.",BENDER
9122,BENDER,Why? 'Cause I can make annoying noises?,BENDER
9124,BENDER,Alright!  Go Bender! Go Bender! Go Bender!,BENDER
9125,BENDER,"Well, that's my good friend, Beck. I'm of to rock a series of mid-level venues.",BENDER
9127,FRY,"Hey, I have an idea. Who wants to cram in my van and follow Bender on tour and live there, in the van?",FRY
9138,BENDER,(electric voice) Got a washboard stomach and a microphone.,BENDER
9144,LEELA,It got ruined in the wash.,LEELA
9145,FRY,"Mine too, even my change.",FRY
9148,BENDER,"Whoa, check out all those broken robots. Howdy, fellas!",BENDER
9153,BENDER,"Aw, hang in there, folks. I'll bet before you know it, you guys'll be -  That is so wrong. They can't just melt down broken robots. Not right when they're kissing my ass.",BENDER
9155,BENDER,"Hey, yeah, I could write a song! With real words, not phony ones like ""odelay"".",BENDER
9158,BENDER,"I'm working on my song. Hand me the Becktionary.  No, no, the rhyming Becktionary.",BENDER
9160,BENDER,"Wait a minute, you know lots of rock stars, and most of them like to look as though they care about things!",BENDER
9162,BENDER,"And we could call it ""Bend-Aid"", after me, Bender!",BENDER
9164,BENDER,And I'll let you sing backup! But remember who the star is. Me: Bender.,BENDER
9165,BENDER,"Alright. ""Hands in the air"" rhymes with ""Just don't care"" and...finished!  Eck! Smells like something died in the wall!",BENDER
9167,LEELA,Mind if we crash here tonight? The colours in the van are keeping us awake.,LEELA
9168,BENDER,"Alright, but hands off the minibar.",BENDER
9169,FRY,"Wow, I forgot about TV. Living free on the road, you realise how much better life is without it. Well, let's see what's on.",FRY
9176,LEELA,"This coming together of superstars really means a lot to you, doesn't it, Bender?",LEELA
9177,BENDER,"(crying) Uh-huh. Helping my defective brothers is the first thing I've ever cared about, even the slightest bit. You know, when I first got broken, I thought my life was over. But look at me now. I've got fame, money, groupies, and it's all thanks to being completely immobolised.  That's why I'll be proud to go up on stage, tomorrow, and say, ""Look at me, world, I am a broken robot!"".",BENDER
9178,FRY,"Bender, you can move! You're cured!",FRY
9179,BENDER,"Oh crap, it's a miracle.",BENDER
9180,BENDER,I can move again. (crying) My music career is over.,BENDER
9181,FRY,"Bender, I don't claim to understand ""the biz"" but wouldn't being able to move help your music career?",FRY
9182,BENDER,"(crying) No, don't you see? I was a hero to broken robots 'cause I was one of them. But how can I sing about being damaged if I'm not? That's like Christina Aguilera singing in Spanish.  Wait, that's it. I'll fake it!",BENDER
9197,FRY,"Brothers and sisters, get your love beads. Can't journey to the centre of your mind without love beads!",FRY
9204,FRY,(shouting) Bender rules!,FRY
9214,BENDER,(crying) I don't know what to say.,BENDER
9216,BENDER,"Ladies, gentlemen, smoking heaps of machinery......this is a song called My Broken Friend.",BENDER
9218,BENDER,(singing) He could make a good...,BENDER
9221,BENDER,(singing) Or a cheap...,BENDER
9224,BENDER,(singing) Or a great big...,BENDER
9225,BENDER AND BECK,(singing) ...giant Thermos,BENDER
9226,BENDER,(singing) With a twist-off top,BENDER
9228,BENDER,(singing) He could be a storage closet...,BENDER
9229,BENDER AND BECK,(singing) ...For outdated pants,BENDER
9231,BENDER,(singing) My broken friend could do it all...,BENDER
9232,BENDER AND BECK,(singing) ...Just give him a chance!,BENDER
9233,BENDER,(singing) That robot has a tragic secret,BENDER
9235,BENDER,(singing) ...My broken friend is closer to me,BENDER
9237,BENDER,(singing) ...That robot's name I never told you...,BENDER
9239,BENDER,(singing) ...You could not foresee...,BENDER
9241,BENDER,(singing) ...I'll say it loud and sing it proud...,BENDER
9242,BENDER AND BECK,(singing) His name is you and me.,BENDER
9243,BENDER,(singing) Don't melt me down into a crowbar,BENDER
9245,BENDER,(singing) Just 'cause I can't move my arms and legs,BENDER
9247,BENDER,(singing) Or toss me into a trash can...,BENDER
9249,BENDER,(singing) ...Just 'cause I can't cook you ham and eggs...,BENDER
9251,BENDER,(singing) ...Don't crush me into an anchor...,BENDER
9253,BENDER,(singing) ...Just 'cause I can't jump and dance and sing...,BENDER
9255,BENDER,"(singing) ...I'm telling you, my broken friend...",BENDER
9257,BENDER,(singing) ...Put your hands in the air like you just don't care!,BENDER
9259,BENDER,"(singing) I'm telling you, my broken friend...",BENDER
9261,BENDER,(singing) ...Can do 'most anything!,BENDER
9265,BENDER,Curse my natural showmanship!,BENDER
9271,BENDER,"Well everyone, prepare to get your guts kicked out by folk singers.",BENDER
9273,FRY,"Hurry, the Golden Gate Bridge. Put the metal to the pedal to the other metal.",FRY
9274,BENDER,"Oh no, I forgot this is a hoverbridge.",BENDER
9275,LEELA,And I forgot this isn't a hovercar.,LEELA
9276,FRY,Is any of that a problem?,FRY
9279,LEELA,"Quick, grab his footcups.",LEELA
9283,BENDER,"(shouting) Someone fat get in my way! (talking) Ah, I'm broken again. I can't move any part of me.",BENDER
9285,BENDER,"I'm really sorry I lied, Beck. All I ever wanted was to make music with you. I never meant to hurt anyone, or help anyone.",BENDER
9287,BENDER,"So, I can, uh, keep the cheque?",BENDER
9289,BENDER,"Well, it was worth a shot.",BENDER
9290,FRY,"(shouting) C'mon, Bender. If you're done scamming Beck, we're heading home.",FRY
9291,BENDER,"Alright, alright. Let me just do one thing to cheer myself up.",BENDER
9295,FRY,"So, Leela, how about a romantic ride in one of those swan boats? They're kinda dangerous but I finally mastered them.",FRY
9296,LEELA,"Those aren't swan boats, they're swans.",LEELA
9297,FRY,Oh. That explains these boat eggs.,FRY
9300,FRY,(shouting) What happens if we lose?,FRY
9302,FARNSWORTH,"This will not stand!  I'll take you on, you air-balling bozos.",FARNSWORTH
9304,FARNSWORTH,"I may be an old man - in fact, I'm fairly sure I am - but I'll put you Globetrotters in your place with my team of mutant atomic supermen!",FARNSWORTH
9306,FARNSWORTH,Behold: My mutant atomic supermen.,FARNSWORTH
9307,LEELA,"They're only a foot high, professor.",LEELA
9308,FARNSWORTH,"Well, they're still young. Mere atomic super boys, really. We'll need to speed up their growth with time particles called Chronitons.",FARNSWORTH
9309,BENDER,Aren't those the particles that destroyed an entire civilisation -,BENDER
9310,FARNSWORTH,"Good news, everyone. You're off to the Tempest Nebula to gather Chronitons.",FARNSWORTH
9311,FRY,"Hey, Leela. Look at me!",FRY
9312,LEELA,Your face can take a lot of punishment. That's good to know.,LEELA
9313,FRY,There's a lot about my face you don't know. Perhaps you and it could get better acquainted over dinner.,FRY
9314,LEELA,"Alright, cool your jets, hotshot.",LEELA
9315,FRY,"C'mon, Leela, why won't you go out with me? We both know there's something there.",FRY
9316,LEELA,"No, I mean cool your jets. They're melting Bender's face.",LEELA
9317,BENDER,(shouting) Ow! Oh my God! Ow!,BENDER
9318,LEELA,Here you go. Hot off the nebula.,LEELA
9319,FARNSWORTH,None too soon. While you were gone the Trotters held a news conference to announce that I was a jive sucker.  Behold! My invincible nuclear mutants.,FARNSWORTH
9329,FARNSWORTH,"No showboarding, you atomic hotdog!",FARNSWORTH
9333,FARNSWORTH,What the?  Did everything just jump around? Or did my brain just stroke off there for a second?,FARNSWORTH
9337,FARNSWORTH,"We seem to be lurching forward randomly in time, like a needle skipping on a record player.",FARNSWORTH
9339,FARNSWORTH,No. It must have something to do with those time particles I used to grow the Supermen. Time and space are ripping apart at the seams.,FARNSWORTH
9341,FARNSWORTH,"Oh, great. Now, on top of everything, we need a new fifth man.",FARNSWORTH
9342,FRY,"Ooh, ooh, ooh, put me in, professor. I wanna show Leela my skills.",FRY
9343,FARNSWORTH,Hmm. Will said skills pay the bills?,FARNSWORTH
9344,FRY,Who cares? We're 35 points ahead with two minutes left. What could possibly -,FRY
9349,LEELA,"I don't know what you did, Fry, but once again you screwed up. Now all the planets are gonna start cracking wise about our mamas.",LEELA
9351,FARNSWORTH,"Enough about your promiscuous mother, Hermes. We have bigger problems. This time disruption is extremely serious.",FARNSWORTH
9353,FARNSWORTH,Tate? What do you know about this?,FARNSWORTH
9355,FARNSWORTH,You're that Bubblegum Tate?,FARNSWORTH
9357,FARNSWORTH,"Yes, I see. Something involving that many big words could easily destabilise time itself.",FARNSWORTH
9359,FARNSWORTH,"Indeed so. At this rate, by Tuesday it will be Thursday; By Wednesday, it will be August and by Thursday, it will be the end of existence as we know it.",FARNSWORTH
9366,FARNSWORTH,"Interesting. It's as if we behave normally during the time skips, but then we have no memory of it.",FARNSWORTH
9368,FARNSWORTH,"...my, yes. Ooh, just like that. Any luck Bubblegum?",FARNSWORTH
9370,FARNSWORTH,Not if you'll grant me the same liberty.,FARNSWORTH
9371,BENDER,"Ooh, ohh, Bubblegum? My name's Bender and I'm a huge fan of your work, both on and off the court. Can I be a Globetrotter?",BENDER
9373,FARNSWORTH,"Bubblegum, look at this. The background time radiation is fluctuating wildly.",FARNSWORTH
9382,FRY,"Psst, Leela. I've set up a time-proof shelter in the closet. There's only room for two, and you're the one I wanna share it with.",FRY
9383,LEELA,"Fry, that's so sweet. Let me see.",LEELA
9384,LEELA,How exactly will this protect us from time jumps?,LEELA
9385,FRY,"(sexfully) Because when we're together in here, baby, time will stand still.",FRY
9388,LEELA,"Dr. Zoidberg, can I talk to you about Fry?",LEELA
9390,LEELA,...Does the worst W.C. Fields imitation I've ever seen. Zoidberg!,LEELA
9392,LEELA,"The thing is, Fry is very sweet. But he's so immature. I love his boyish charm but I hate his childishness.",LEELA
9394,FARNSWORTH,"Ah, there is it. The Tempest Nebula. Take a whiff through the smellescope.",FARNSWORTH
9396,FARNSWORTH,"The odour of pure time leaking. When my crew removed the Chronitons, it destabilised the nebula, causing time skips throughout the universe.",FARNSWORTH
9397,BENDER,"Ooh, let Bubblegum tell it.",BENDER
9401,FARNSWORTH,Their gravity might just divert the Chronitons to the empty side of the universe.,FARNSWORTH
9407,FARNSWORTH,"Ah, there we are. One gravity pump. Powerful enough to move the stars themselves. Now to begin the arduous task of attaching it to the ship so th -",FARNSWORTH
9408,FARNSWORTH,Off you go - apparently.,FARNSWORTH
9410,LEELA,Just a few...more...hundred...thousand...miles. There!,LEELA
9412,LEELA,"We'll have to run some tests back on Earth, but I think we've stopped the time skips.",LEELA
9416,BENDER,And what better way to celebrate our success than by me showing Bubblegum the Globetrotter uniform I made myself!,BENDER
9418,FRY,"Leela, I want you to know I think the way you moved those stars around was really wonderful. I got you something.",FRY
9419,LEELA,"Moderately-priced, domestic, non-vintage champagne? How did you know?",LEELA
9420,FRY,"You deserve it. I mean, nobody ever stops to tell you what a great captain you are.",FRY
9421,LEELA,"Aww, that is so true and sweet.",LEELA
9422,FRY,"You're smart, you're beautiful, and best of all, you'll go out with me-ee?",FRY
9423,LEELA,"Fry, please try to understand. You're a man, I'm a woman. We're just too different.",LEELA
9424,BENDER,"Hey, Leela. Bubblegum might let me organise a bake sale for the Globetrotter wives. Can you teach me to make cupcakes?",BENDER
9425,LEELA,"Alright, but I wanna lick the beaters.",LEELA
9426,FRY,"I got her champagne, I opened it. What does a guy have to do?",FRY
9428,FRY,Hmm. Maybe this is the moment to show her my real surprise.,FRY
9429,LEELA,"Fry, what are you doing?",LEELA
9431,FRY,Look. I've been studying how to pilot the ship. Impressed?,FRY
9432,LEELA,"Yeah, actually. You're doing OK. The core reactor temperature's nominal, the blinker's off.",LEELA
9433,FRY,I learned how to work the gravity pump too. In case we need to move more stars. So are we dating now?,FRY
9434,LEELA,"Is that what this is all about? Please, just cut it out now.",LEELA
9435,FRY,"Look, Leela. I know there's some perfect, amazing thing I can do to make you love me, and when I figure out what it is -",FRY
9436,LEELA,"Fry, stop. I don't wanna hurt you, but there is absolutely, positively no way that you and I will ever, ever -",LEELA
9441,FARNSWORTH,"Ye Gods, Bubblegum, we failed. The time skips haven't stopped at all.",FARNSWORTH
9443,LEELA,"You tricked me into marrying you, didn't you?",LEELA
9445,LEELA,How'd you do it? Drugs in the champagne? Hypnosis?,LEELA
9446,FRY,"No! Drugs are for losers and hypnosis is for losers with big, weird eyebrows. I don't know what amazing thing I did you make you love me but, whatever it was, we're married now. We've got the rest of our lives to work -",FRY
9449,LEELA,"Well, let's divide up the china. I guess I'll take the NFC helmets and you can have the AFC helmets.",LEELA
9450,FRY,Fine. Break my heart again.,FRY
9452,FRY,How did I do it? How did I get Leela to love me? I've got to figure it out.,FRY
9455,FRY,I don't know what I'm doing.,FRY
9456,BENDER,"Maybe she'd come back to you if your best friend Bender were a Globetrotter. What do you say, Bubblegum?",BENDER
9458,FRY,"Oh, it's hopeless. I did something so great that it won Leela's heart and I'll never, ever know what it was. My life is empty.",FRY
9460,FARNSWORTH,No wonder we failed to stop the time skips. Diverting Chronitons is mathematically impossible. I knew I should have checked your showboating Globetrotter algebra.,FARNSWORTH
9463,FARNSWORTH,The time skips are worse than ever now. Isolated spots are jumping by years at a time. Look.,FARNSWORTH
9466,FARNSWORTH,"Well, I'm stumped. We'll have to call in the finest scientific minds in the univ -",FARNSWORTH
9467,FARNSWORTH,"Perhaps we could explode the whole damned nebula. What do you think, Curly Joe?",FARNSWORTH
9470,FARNSWORTH,"By God, Sweet Clyde is right. An implosion might just form a black hole that would stop more Chronitons from escaping.",FARNSWORTH
9472,FARNSWORTH,"Doomsday device? Ah, now the ball's in Farnsworth's court.  I suppose I could part with one and still be feared.",FARNSWORTH
9477,BENDER,(gasping) Did you just say -,BENDER
9481,BENDER,"Please, please let me come with you. I can make myself taller.",BENDER
9485,BENDER,"I mean, with time, my funk level could -",BENDER
9490,LEELA,"Careful with that doomsday device, Bender.",LEELA
9491,BENDER,"What does it matter? I'll never be a Globetrotter. My life, and, by extension, everyone else's, is meaningless.",BENDER
9493,FRY,"Leela, about the wedding. I don't know what I did to make you love me, and I don't think I tricked you into it, but maybe I did. And if I did, I'm sorry.",FRY
9494,LEELA,"It's OK, Fry. You know we'll always be friends, right?",LEELA
9495,FRY,Yeah. But I don't guess anything I could do will ever make you feel the same way about me that I do about you.,FRY
9497,BENDER,"Well, the doomsday device is ready. Maybe blasting this quadrant of space into a hell storm of flaming nothingness will cheer me up a little.",BENDER
9498,LEELA,"OK. Let me just take the ship out to a safe distance.  Actually, I think I'll go down and prep the detonator. Fry, why don't you take the helm?",LEELA
9499,FRY,She's so great. I feel like I can almost remember the magical thing I did to make her love me. But I guess I never will.,FRY
9500,BENDER,"Sorry, buddy. I too know what it's like to have a dream I'll never achieve.",BENDER
9501,FRY,Oh!  That's how I must have done it! I moved the stars themselves to write her a love note in the sky.,FRY
9502,LEELA,"Detonation in three, two, one.",LEELA
9503,FRY,(screaming) Nooo!  Did you see it? Did you see it?,FRY
9516,FRY,"I just saw something incredibly cool. A big floating ball that lit up with every colour of the rainbow, plus some new ones that were so beautiful I fell to my knees and cried.",FRY
9520,FRY,Well I don't care if it was some dork in a costume. For one brief moment I felt the heartbeat of creation. And it was one with my own.,FRY
9522,BENDER,We all feel like that all the time. You don't hear us gassin' on about it.,BENDER
9523,FRY,"How can you people be so blase? Here you are in the year 3000 or so, yet you just sit around like its the boring time I came from.",FRY
9524,FARNSWORTH,Boring? Wasn't that the period where they cracked the human genome and boy bands roamed the Earth?,FARNSWORTH
9525,FRY,Yeah. But now its the distant future. Why aren't we out doing everything I ever dreamed of?,FRY
9526,LEELA,"Hey, you know what might be fun?",LEELA
9527,FARNSWORTH,No. Why would I know that?,FARNSWORTH
9528,LEELA,Let's take the rest of the morning off and take Fry to do everything he ever wanted to do.,LEELA
9532,FRY,"Yeah, what did they ever do for me?",FRY
9533,LEELA,"Wow, the most humdrum activities look almost exciting through your eyes. What should we do next?",LEELA
9534,FRY,I wanna see the edge of the universe!,FRY
9537,FRY,"Far out! So, there's an infinite number of parallel universes?",FRY
9539,FRY,"Oh, well, I'm sure that's enough.",FRY
9540,BENDER,I'm sick of parallel Bender lording his cowboy head over me! Let's move on to Fry's next fantasy.,BENDER
9541,FRY,"(shouting) Yeehah! Bow before your master, puny mortals! Whoo! Giddy-up! Ha ha! Woohoo! Whoopie!",FRY
9544,FRY,That was fun. Let's give him a treat!,FRY
9547,FRY,These new hands are great. I'm gonna break them in tonight.,FRY
9548,FARNSWORTH,Yes it's been quite an hour and a half.,FARNSWORTH
9549,FRY,I've only got two fantasies left: Be invisible in a chocolate factory and be romantically linked with a celebrity.,FRY
9550,BENDER,I could pound your head 'til you thinks that's what happened.,BENDER
9552,LEELA,"Wait, hold on. It is actually possible to meet any celebrity you want.",LEELA
9554,LEELA,Of course! You should read a blimp sometime.,LEELA
9555,FRY,Download a celebrity from the internet? What part of that do I understand?,FRY
9556,LEELA,It's simple. You can download a celebrity's personality and appearance into a blank robot.,LEELA
9557,FRY,"Hey, I have an idea. Let's do that!",FRY
9558,FARNSWORTH,Onto the internet you go!,FARNSWORTH
9559,BENDER,Oh and while you're there pick me up a few credit card numbers.,BENDER
9566,FRY,So where's the celebrity dating place?,FRY
9567,LEELA,Let's search the web.  Over there.,LEELA
9569,FRY,Nah. I read in Newsweek that she drinks human blood.,FRY
9571,FRY,I'd prefer someone from the era of shaved underarms. Do you have anything with a more Lucy Liu feel to it?,FRY
9573,FRY,I'd like the 2003 model.,FRY
9574,FRY,Wahoo! I've found her! What do I do now?,FRY
9575,FARNSWORTH,Download her. Let's just put a blank robot in the drive.,FARNSWORTH
9578,FRY,(muffled) It worked perfectly!,FRY
9579,LEELA,"Well, you downloaded Lucy Liu. Are you just going to stare vacantly at her and not say anything?",LEELA
9581,FRY,Did you hear that? She likes me!,FRY
9582,FARNSWORTH,Well duh! She's programmed to like you!,FARNSWORTH
9583,FRY,But this is Lucy Liu! Perhaps the only good actress of the 21st century! She's more than just a piece of software.,FRY
9587,FRY,"So uh, what do you feel like doing?",FRY
9590,FRY,"Then when I feel so stuffed I can't eat anymore, I just use the restroom, and then I can eat more.",FRY
9592,FRY,Oh Lucy! You're just like I always thought you'd be from your movies.,FRY
9601,FARNSWORTH,"Oh dear! She's stuck in an infinite loop and he's an idiot. Well, that's love for you.",FARNSWORTH
9602,BENDER,Humans dating robots is sick. You people wonder why I'm still single?? It's 'cause all the fun robot sisters are dating humans!,BENDER
9603,LEELA,"Bender, this is Fry's decision. And he made it wrong, so it's time for us to interfere in his life.",LEELA
9604,LEELA,She doesn't really love you. She can't. She's just a machine that -,LEELA
9605,FRY,"Well, so what if I love a robot? It's not hurting anybody.",FRY
9607,FARNSWORTH,It's just lucky I keep a copy in the VCR at all times!,FARNSWORTH
9619,LEELA,Did that make any impression on you Fry? Fry?,LEELA
9621,FARNSWORTH,I knew I should have shown him Electro Gonhorrhea: The Noisy Killer.,FARNSWORTH
9622,BENDER,"What is the world coming to? That Fry's a sicko pervert I tell you, dating a robot. It's an atrosmacy.",BENDER
9623,LEELA,But Fry's our friend Bender.,LEELA
9624,BENDER,Aww jeez would you stifle there meatbag?,BENDER
9627,LEELA,Although he is completely right.,LEELA
9628,BENDER,We've got to stem this tidal wave of moral decay. It's time to shut down nappster.com!,BENDER
9629,BENDER,Who's in charge of this dump?,BENDER
9631,BENDER,Listen you fat internet nerd.,BENDER
9633,BENDER,Your company promotes wrong love! If you don't shut down right now the only thing wired about you will be your jaw!,BENDER
9642,BENDER,So what's your problem?,BENDER
9645,LEELA,We can't take that chance. Move people move!,LEELA
9654,BENDER,Hey don't look at me like that. If you're thinking of crossing the line with Bender you can forget it. Bender don't bend that way.,BENDER
9655,LEELA,Hey look its another Lucy Liubot.,LEELA
9660,LEELA,Alright Liu. Time to kick your frosty well toned ass! Heyya!,LEELA
9661,BENDER,Then along came Bender!,BENDER
9664,BENDER,Aw shucks. I wasn't afraid of that robot. I'm pretty brave when you get past my macho exterior!  It's an army of Lucy Lius!,BENDER
9669,FRY,This is the best movie I've ever seen. It has a vampire and an explosion!,FRY
9676,FRY,"Aww, you guys came to watch me make out! That is so sweet.  Wait a minute! Is that the head of who I think it's of?",FRY
9678,LEELA,"Fry, a herd of Lucy Liu are destroying the city. Is yours acting normally?",LEELA
9679,FRY,Let me see.  Yep. Why do you ask?,FRY
9683,LEELA,And Nappster says illegal copies never hurt anybody.,LEELA
9685,FRY,"Sorry laides, employees only.",FRY
9686,LEELA,Oh no. They're forming a human pyramid...of robots.,LEELA
9687,BENDER,Dammit! We weren't counting on them being as smart as they are sexy!,BENDER
9690,LEELA,Dr Zoidberg cut open that bag!,LEELA
9694,BENDER,You'll be safe in here sweetheart. Get lost Pavorotti!,BENDER
9695,FRY,"Lucy Liubot, if I don't survive the corn I want you to know that I love you as much as a man can love a computerised image of gorgeous celebrity. Which it turns out is a lot.",FRY
9697,FRY,What are you doing darling? Get down!,FRY
9698,FRY,You saved us. Are you alright?,FRY
9705,FRY,But I just downloaded her because I love you.,FRY
9707,FRY,I'm sorry. Hug me Liubot.,FRY
9709,BENDER,I know it hurts buddy. But at least you're not in a sick relationship with a robot anymore.,BENDER
9710,FRY,Uh huh. And I guess now maybe I can get to know the real Lucy Liu.,FRY
9711,BENDER,Pft! Yeah at our wedding!,BENDER
9717,FRY,"I've never seen a supernova blow up. But if it's anything like my old Chevy Nova, it'll light up the night sky!",FRY
9718,BENDER,"Yeah, anyone who misses this will regret it for the rest of his life! Hey Fry could you go make some popcorn?",BENDER
9720,FRY,"Let's go microwave, I'm in a hurry here! Hm?  Hey, what smells like blue?",FRY
9721,LEELA,Fry get up here it's starting!,LEELA
9724,FRY,"Hey, which crazy thing happening are you guys screaming about?",FRY
9727,FRY,"Aw, it's less popped than ever.",FRY
9728,LEELA,I don't know what happened but we've taken on a lot of clocks.  Let's get back home.,LEELA
9729,LEELA,Why is there so little traffic around Earth?,LEELA
9730,FARNSWORTH,And what's this layer of ozone? That's never been there before.,FARNSWORTH
9732,LEELA,Oh no! There's no global positioning signal! Navigation is failing!,LEELA
9734,LEELA,"Not if I can help it!  Oh, I guess I can't. Everyone put on your seatbelts.",LEELA
9735,BENDER,Ah those things cost more lives than they save.,BENDER
9737,BENDER,I dunno. I'll try to move my feet.,BENDER
9738,LEELA,"Alright, here's the plan. Zoidberg, pick up the pieces. Everyone else, take five.",LEELA
9743,FARNSWORTH,Remarkable! According the high precision digital chronograph it's July 9th 1947. Which would explain why the chronograph has turned into this pin-up calendar.,FARNSWORTH
9744,BENDER,Wait a second. You mean we travelled through time?,BENDER
9745,FARNSWORTH,Doy! Some idiot must have put metal in the microwave...,FARNSWORTH
9747,FARNSWORTH,...and the microwave's radiation combined with the gravitons and graviolis from the supernova blasted us through Time itself.,FARNSWORTH
9748,LEELA,Have you seen today's news?,LEELA
9749,BENDER,High school gym renovations on schedule? What a load!,BENDER
9750,LEELA,No over here!  Flying Saucer Captured!,LEELA
9751,BENDER,"That's no flying saucer, that's my ass!",BENDER
9752,FRY,My God! This mean the flying saucer that crashed in Roswell...was...us!,FRY
9753,FARNSWORTH,And the alien they captured was...was...,FARNSWORTH
9757,FARNSWORTH,Yes we tore the universe a new space-hole alright! But it's clenching shut fast. Our only hope of getting back to our own time is to go through it in oh say......exactly 24 hours.,FARNSWORTH
9758,LEELA,No problem. The ship's fixed except for the cup holder and I think I can have that operational within 10 hours.,LEELA
9759,FARNSWORTH,You've got 8. But a more urgent concern is the microwave.  Without a working one we have no hope of returning to the future.,FARNSWORTH
9760,LEELA,"Well, I'm sure we can buy a microwave from somewhere around here.  Meanwhile you guys sneak onto the army base and rescue Bender's body.",LEELA
9761,FRY,"Hey, and while we're on the base I'll visit my grandfather Enos! He was stationed at Roswell.",FRY
9762,FARNSWORTH,"Your grandfather?  Stay away from him you dimwitted monkey. You mustn't interfere with the past. Don't do anything that affects anything, unless it turns out you were supposed to do it. In which case. for the love of God, don't not do it!",FARNSWORTH
9764,FARNSWORTH,"If for example you were to kill your grandfather, you would cease to exist!",FARNSWORTH
9765,FRY,But existing is basically all I do!,FRY
9772,FRY,It's him! It's my grandfather Enos.,FRY
9774,FRY,That jeep's gonna hit him! And I won't exist anymore!  Are you crazy? You almost got yourself run over!,FRY
9776,BENDER,Fry! Stop interfering with history! I don't wanna have to memorise a lot of new kings when I get back!,BENDER
9777,FRY (WHISPERING),"I had no choice. I was about to not exist. I could feel myself fading away, like Greg Kinnear.",FRY
9779,FRY,That's it! This place is too dangerous. We've gotta get you out of here!  Everything's gonna be alright Dad!,FRY
9781,FRY (SHOUTING),No time! Run! Run to safety!,FRY
9786,LEELA,"Fry's from around this time, I'll talk like him.",LEELA
9787,LEELA,Yo homes! We're looking for a microwave oven.,LEELA
9789,LEELA,"Oh I'm sorry, now I'll ax you again: Where can we find a mi-cro-wave?",LEELA
9791,FARNSWORTH,Ooo that's good news! You know you really don't cook enough roast Leela!  Ooo. Women!,FARNSWORTH
9792,FRY,Thank God I got you off that dangerour army base!,FRY
9794,BENDER,"Hey, that's my brain...",BENDER
9797,FRY,Yowza! I know what I want for dessert!,FRY
9799,FRY,"Grandma Mildred?! Uh, no dessert, just coffee.",FRY
9802,FRY,Eh she sure is pretty. You ought to marry her and father some children right away!,FRY
9804,FRY,What?? Don't ever say or think that again! Please. Just concentrate on staying alive!  Fire! Look out!  Oh! You almost got neutered.,FRY
9806,FRY,For me it is!  I'm getting you out of here!,FRY
9807,FRY,"OK, we're in the middle of nowhere, which is the safest part of nowhere. Just stay put and enjoy this calendar.",FRY
9808,FRY,Safe and sound! Finally I can continue to exist!,FRY
9810,BENDER,And you are outta here!,BENDER
9812,FARNSWORTH,"I'll have the soylent green, with a slice of soylent orange and some soylent coleslaw.",FARNSWORTH
9814,LEELA (WHISPERING),It's the 20th century Professor.,LEELA
9815,FARNSWORTH,"Oh right!  I'll have a croque monsieur, the paella, two mutton pills and a stein of mead!",FARNSWORTH
9816,LEELA,I'll just have a small injection of femislim.,LEELA
9818,LEELA,"Well, settle in. Without a microwave we're trapped in this time period.",LEELA
9819,FARNSWORTH,"Oh Lord! We'll have to endure the horrible music of the big bopper, and then the terrible tragedy of his death.",FARNSWORTH
9820,LEELA,Wait a second. There's a microwave radar dish at the army base. We could steal it!,LEELA
9821,FARNSWORTH,"No! That would alter history. Above all else, it is our sacred duty to preserve the past exactly as it was.",FARNSWORTH
9822,FRY,"Well, I killed my grandfather.",FRY
9824,LEELA,Wait. If you killed your grandfather then why do you stll exist?,LEELA
9825,FRY,I dunno. Maybe God loves me.,FRY
9827,FRY,"Aww. There there. If it makes you feel any better, his body was vapourised so there's no chance of him coming back as a zombie.",FRY
9829,FRY,Then you're a braver woman than I.,FRY
9847,FRY,Aww I know how you feel. My grandfather died recently.,FRY
9849,FRY,"Hey, you know what always cheers you up? Baking me a nice tray of sugar cookies!",FRY
9851,FRY,I shouldn't be here. I shouldn't even exist. But I do which proves...you can't really be my grandm -,FRY
9853,FARNSWORTH,What the hell have you done Fry?,FARNSWORTH
9854,FRY,Relax! She can't be my grandmother! I figured it all out.,FRY
9856,FRY,"It's impossible! I mean, if she's my grandmother, who's my grandfather?",FRY
9864,FARNSWORTH,Start the ship Leela. Let's just steal the damned radar dish and get back to our own time!,FARNSWORTH
9865,FRY,But...but won't that change history?,FRY
9866,FARNSWORTH,Oh a lesson in not changing history from Mr I'm-My-Own-Grandpa! Let's get the hell out of here already! Screw history!,FARNSWORTH
9872,FRY,"Take this Mr President, sir!",FRY
9878,FARNSWORTH,Choke on that causality!,FARNSWORTH
9879,BENDER,1947 can kiss my shiny metal...,BENDER
9880,FRY,Turn around. We've gotta go back for Bender!,FRY
9881,FARNSWORTH,"Impossible. The supernova timehole is closing! If we don't leave now, we'll never get back to the 31st century!",FARNSWORTH
9884,LEELA,Don't you need this one?,LEELA
9886,FRY,"Oh, poor Bender. He must be so lonely right now. Trapped a thousand years in the past. Hey! Wait a second!",FRY
9890,FRY,He's alive!  Bender. What was it like lying in that hole for a thousand years?,FRY
9891,BENDER,I was enjoying it until you guys showed up.,BENDER
9892,FARNSWORTH,"Well, now everything is back as it was. And if history doesn't care that out degenerate friend Fry is his own grandfather, then who are we to judge?",FARNSWORTH
9900,BENDER,This guy's too trustworthy. What's his angle?,BENDER
9903,FRY,Just as well. I'm getting tired of this wood show.,FRY
9904,FARNSWORTH,"Cover that fireplace, confound you! I've only a few years to live. I don't wanna spend them dead.",FARNSWORTH
9905,LEELA,We're pushing as hard as we can.,LEELA
9907,FARNSWORTH,"Oh, we're doomed! Every year we're doomed. Thanks be I had these bullet-proof shutters installed.",FARNSWORTH
9908,FARNSWORTH,"Bring it on, Santa! That bloodthirsty cadaver junkie can't touch us as long as we're not stupid enough to leave this building.",FARNSWORTH
9911,FARNSWORTH,"In a related matter, you'll be delivering this sack of children's letters directly to Santa at his death fortress on Neptune.",FARNSWORTH
9912,FRY,These letters are real butt-nutters! Listen to this one: (reading) Dear Santa.,FRY
9914,LEELA,Awful! Let's read some more. (reading) Dear Santa.,LEELA
9916,FRY,"It's not fair. In my day Xmas was supposed to bring people together, not blow them apart!",FRY
9917,BENDER,"Sure, but who's going to do anything about it? Certainly not us. No, sir!",BENDER
9918,FRY,"Certainly yes us! Uh-huh, sir! We've gotta bring back the kind of Xmas I remember.",FRY
9919,LEELA,Fry's right. It's time to sit on Santa's lap -- and hard!,LEELA
9920,LEELA,"Oh, look! A cute little welcoming party.",LEELA
9923,FRY,"Uh, look, we've got mail for Santa. Are you his elves?",FRY
9928,FRY,But you live in a gingerbread house.,FRY
9930,BENDER,You lazy runts! Don't you get paid for making the toys?,BENDER
9934,FRY,That's it! I'm gonna deliver a gift of my boot up Santa's chimney. Where is he?,FRY
9936,LEELA,We'll need help getting in. Any volunteers?,LEELA
9945,LEELA,"Santa's a robot, so we should be able to destroy him with a logical paradox. Bender, you'd better cover your ears.",LEELA
9947,LEELA,"Hold it Santa!  Consider this: You are programmed to destroy the naughty. But many of those you destroy are in fact, nice. I submit to you, that you are naughty, and logically, you must destroy yourself.",LEELA
9949,LEELA,Wait! This is what we're running from!,LEELA
9952,LEELA,I don't know. Usually when I do stuff like this the ship moves.,LEELA
9957,FRY,And I can deliver them. Billions and billions in one night.,FRY
9961,BENDER,"Santa's right. We need some sort of robot.  Aw, crap! I'm some sort of robot.",BENDER
9964,BENDER,"Oh, yeah? Well I wasn't built to steal Leela's purse either.  But that didn't stop me.",BENDER
9970,FRY,(singing) Which is good because we don't intend to pay.,FRY
9973,LEELA,"(singing) Then you'll all work triple shifts,",LEELA
9974,FRY LEELA AND BENDER,(singing) It's back to work on Xmas Eve!,FRY
9976,LEELA,"(singing) And though you're cold and sore and ugly,",LEELA
9979,BENDER,"(singing) Why you selfish little bastards,",BENDER
9981,BENDER,(singing) Then shut your yaps and back to work.,BENDER
9983,FRY,"(singing) These toys soldiers are poorly painted,",FRY
9984,LEELA,(singing) And they're made from inferior wood.,LEELA
9985,BENDER,"(singing) I should give you all a beating,",BENDER
9988,LEELA,"(singing) You did the best you could, br>I guess that some of these gorillas are OK,",LEELA
9991,BENDER,"(stupid voice) Duh! Gee, Bender, how you gonna get through these bars? (normal voice) I dunno, moron, suppose I bend them? (stupid voice) Duh, OK!",BENDER
9994,BENDER,"No, wait! I'm the good Santa. I've got toys ... at very reasonable prices!",BENDER
9996,BENDER,But I come bearing Tri-ominos!,BENDER
10000,BENDER,"Uh, don't mind if I do.  Ow! What's in these things?",BENDER
10004,BENDER,"Oh, it's awful, Kwanzabot. Everyone hates me.",BENDER
10006,BENDER,Hey! Maybe you could lend me a hand with these deliveries.,BENDER
10008,FRY,Ah! Bathtub eggnog! Just the way Grandma used to drink.  Ew! It went sour!,FRY
10010,LEELA,"Remember, Professor: Bender is Santa. So we don't need to hurt him, right?",LEELA
10011,FARNSWORTH,"Yes, yes, yes. You sound like a broken mp3!",FARNSWORTH
10013,LEELA,(shouting) Professor! Don't you remember what I told you?,LEELA
10015,BENDER,"(crying) Oh, there's gotta be a better way.",BENDER
10016,BENDER,Bender you're a genius!,BENDER
10018,BENDER,Now it's time for Santa to screw open his present!,BENDER
10027,BENDER,Isn't it true that you have been paid for your testimony?,BENDER
10029,BENDER,And yet you haven't said what I told you to say. How can any of us trust you?,BENDER
10033,LEELA,It's not fair. I just hope that dumb chicken is ashamed of himself.,LEELA
10036,BENDER,"Hey, that guy said to tell you that--",BENDER
10039,LEELA,"Outta my way, shrimp-oh. We're here to bring Santa back so we can prove Bender's innocent.",LEELA
10042,FRY,"Oh, no! The ice is melting!",FRY
10043,LEELA,The pollution from the factory. It caused a greenhouse effect.,LEELA
10045,FRY,And your breezy short-shorts!,FRY
10047,FRY,Hurry! We've gotta think of another way to save Bender or Xmas will be ruined!,FRY
10051,BENDER,"But, Mr. Mayor, that doesn't sound humane.",BENDER
10058,LEELA,You got the wrong Santa. And I'll prove it.,LEELA
10065,FRY,"Your Mayorness, if you execute him, you have to execute all of us.",FRY
10067,BENDER,"No! Not the magnets!  (singing) Swing low, sweet chariot, coming for to carry me home.  Swing low sweet--",BENDER
10073,BENDER,Santa! You saved my life. Please don't kill me!,BENDER
10075,BENDER,"Gee whiz, Santa! You want me to help you?",BENDER
10076,FRY,Don't do it! He's evil!,FRY
10078,BENDER,Well ... 'tis the season!,BENDER
10083,LEELA,"This wangs chun! After all the good we tried to do, Xmas turned out as rotten as ever.",LEELA
10087,FRY,Wait a second! Maybe your futuristic Xmas isn't so rotten after all.,FRY
10088,LEELA,"What are you talking about, you crouton? You said it yourself: Xmas should be about bringing people together, not blowing them apart.",LEELA
10089,FRY,But don't you see? Fear has brought us together. That's the magic of Xmas!,FRY
10090,FARNSWORTH,That's a big crock of--  Hold me!,FARNSWORTH
10091,BENDER,"On, Trasher! On, Smasher!  Hey, Kwanzaabot, where you off to?",BENDER
10095,BENDER,"Hey, chief, you screwed up. There's nothing in here.",BENDER
10099,FARNSWORTH,"There. I've finished fine tuning my What If? machine. It can answer any What If? question, accurate to within 1/10th of a plausibility unit.",FARNSWORTH
10100,LEELA,That's so plausible I can't believe it!,LEELA
10101,FARNSWORTH,Who wants the machine to show them an alternate reality?,FARNSWORTH
10102,BENDER,"I wanna know what would happen if I were human. I mean, being a robot's great but we don't have emotions and sometimes that makes me very sad.",BENDER
10103,FARNSWORTH,"Oh lordy loo! There he goes again. Well, let's give baby what he wants.  What if Bender were human?",FARNSWORTH
10104,FARNSWORTH,"Good news everyone. I've discovered a way to make Bender human using a process I call ""reverse fossilisation.""",FARNSWORTH
10106,FARNSWORTH,"Well, in regular fossilisation, flesh and bone turn to minerals. Realising that, it was a simple matter to reverse the process. I've already tested it by turning the toaster into a racoon.",FARNSWORTH
10109,BENDER,I dunno. I'm beginning to have second thoughts -,BENDER
10111,FARNSWORTH,It worked! Eat it everyone who never won a Nobel Prize! And that includes you Amy!,FARNSWORTH
10112,BENDER,"So this is the human body huh? Neat! Hey, my antenna's gone.  Nah it just moved. I'm not getting good reception on it though. Maybe if I wiggle it around a little.",BENDER
10113,FRY (WHISPERING),Bender no! You'll make God cry.,FRY
10114,BENDER,Well lets see what kind of things thing body can do.  Hey that's pretty fun. Being human is great!,BENDER
10116,BENDER,"Guy guys, you've gotta see this. You're not gonna believe it!",BENDER
10117,LEELA,Bender it's OK to be pround but don;t be a show off.,LEELA
10118,BENDER,"Whoa, you look a lot better than you used to for some reason.",BENDER
10120,BENDER,Hey that felt great!  Nah its not working anymore.,BENDER
10123,LEELA,Bender you drank and smoked when you were a robot.,LEELA
10124,BENDER,But now its bad for me! Woo!,BENDER
10125,FRY,"Speaking of which, try these nachos.",FRY
10126,BENDER,"Mmm, why didn't anyone tell me tasting things tasted so good?  What's going on? That rhythm. Its doing something to my human butt.",BENDER
10128,BENDER,Oh my God I bet I can eat nachos and go to the bathroom at the same time!,BENDER
10134,FARNSWORTH,"Come Bender, its time to go home and rest. I need you in top shape next week when I present you to the Nobel Prize committee. Bender?",FARNSWORTH
10137,FARNSWORTH,"Uh as I've said before, I used reverse fossilisation, which is the reverse of regular, uh...",FARNSWORTH
10139,FARNSWORTH,"Ah, them without further stalling for time, I present to the Nobel judges, the first robot ever turned into a human.",FARNSWORTH
10142,LEELA,Well that's not so bad.,LEELA
10144,FARNSWORTH,"This, uh, scientific breakthrough, uh, heralds a new dawn in human-robot relations yes.",FARNSWORTH
10145,BENDER,"C'mere and give old Bender a kiss. Hey, you like grilled cheese?",BENDER
10146,FARNSWORTH,"And, uh thats why I believe I deserve the Nobel Prize.",FARNSWORTH
10148,BENDER,"Wait. As men of science are not your minds open to new ideas? I say, do not judge me until you have tried my way of life for yourselves.",BENDER
10155,FARNSWORTH,Care to say a few words Bender?,FARNSWORTH
10158,FARNSWORTH,About 12 hours ago when the party started.,FARNSWORTH
10160,FARNSWORTH,No. That was air escaping from the folds of his fat.  Goodnight sweet prince. You were the greatest man any of us will ever know. Well lets get him out of here. He's starting to smell up the joint.,FARNSWORTH
10162,FARNSWORTH,Who else has a question for the What If? machine? Scruffy? Katrina? Xanfor?,FARNSWORTH
10163,FRY,Ooo I have one. I'm good at video games and bad at everything else. That's why I wish life were more like a video game.,FRY
10164,FARNSWORTH,Can you put that in the form of a question?,FARNSWORTH
10165,FRY,"Uh, What if that thing I said?",FRY
10166,FARNSWORTH,Oh great machine we beseech thee. What if life were more like a video game?,FARNSWORTH
10168,FRY,"Wait a second, I know that monkey. His name is Donkey.",FRY
10169,FARNSWORTH,Monkies aren't donkies! Quit messing with my head!,FARNSWORTH
10175,FRY,"Well sir, I spent all of ninth grade studying them. Except for that day when my eyeballs started to bleed. And in my opinion.",FRY
10181,LEELA,"Oh my god, he ate Fry! Fry is dead!",LEELA
10182,FRY,"Its OK, I had another guy!",FRY
10184,LEELA,Invaders! Possibly from space!,LEELA
10186,FRY,"Alright, its Saturday night. I have no date, a two litre bottle of Shasta, and my all Rush mix tape! Let's rock!",FRY
10189,FRY,I've still got a trick or two up my sleeve. Watch as I fire up through our own shields.,FRY
10190,BENDER,He's a madman! A madman!!,BENDER
10193,FRY,"Amy, tend to the widow pac-man.",FRY
10197,FRY [SWEATING],It's moving too fast. Oh I could never get the last one. My brother always got it for me!,FRY
10201,FRY,What do you monsters want?,FRY
10204,FARNSWORTH,Forget it you pixelated pirates. We need those quarters to do our laundry.,FARNSWORTH
10215,FARNSWORTH,"Well, there's time for one last question. Let's turn to the Who Ask machine to see who's next.",FARNSWORTH
10217,LEELA,"OK, ahem. As an alien who was abandoned on Earth, I've never really belonged anywhere.",LEELA
10221,LEELA,So my question is this: What if I found my true home?  Ow!,LEELA
10223,LEELA,"Nibbler, I don't think we're in New New York anymore.  Jeez, apparently the phrase tone it down doesn't exist on this planet.  Oh no! We hit someone! Quick, back into the ships.  Ooo, nice boots!",LEELA
10225,LEELA,A witch? That explains how these boots magically appeared on my feet.,LEELA
10227,LEELA,"Well...its hard to find shoes that fit me. So anyway, who are you people? Haven't I seen you in some copyrighted movie?",LEELA
10230,LEELA,"Yeah, can anyone fix my ship so I can get home?",LEELA
10232,LEELA,You mean that yellow brick road?,LEELA
10236,FRY,"OK crow, prepare to be scared.  And then - honk honk - the car honked it's own horn!",FRY
10237,LEELA,"Wow, a talking scarecrow. Wanna come with us to see the Professor? He might be able to give you a brain.",LEELA
10238,FRY,"Hey, that's not a nice thing to say.",FRY
10241,BENDER,Now did you say you were off to see the Professor? 'Cause I could use a heart. A human heart. I need to pump a lot of blood out of my basement.,BENDER
10246,FRY,"Man, we've been skipping for hours. I need to pull over and take the wiz.",FRY
10248,LEELA,Why did you bring us here?,LEELA
10251,LEELA,"And live here? And be a witch like you? Yeah, alright. As long as I get to hurt people and not just dance around at the equinox.",LEELA
10253,LEELA,"Oh mommy, I found my true home!",LEELA
10257,BENDER,I've heard worse excuses to drink. Oops.,BENDER
10259,BENDER,"Well, no point in letting her go to waste.",BENDER
10261,LEELA,We're here to see the Professor.,LEELA
10263,LEELA,Oh for the love of Benji.,LEELA
10264,FARNSWORTH,I am the Professor. Great and...uh...forgetful! Now what do you nice kids want?,FARNSWORTH
10266,FARNSWORTH,"Oh blithery poop my cowardly lobster! You don't need courage. Afterall, who needs courage when you have a gun?",FARNSWORTH
10268,FARNSWORTH,"And you lad, all you need is brain.",FARNSWORTH
10269,FRY,Why does everyone keep saying that?,FRY
10270,BENDER,This is a stick up. Give me the bag old man!,BENDER
10271,FARNSWORTH,Here you go my friend. 5000 Professor Land fun bucks!,FARNSWORTH
10273,FARNSWORTH,"As for you young lady, you want to go home right?",FARNSWORTH
10274,LEELA,No not anymore. I wanna stay here and become the new Wicked Witch.,LEELA
10275,FARNSWORTH,"Nonsense. Now click your big honking boots together three times and wish to go home to Kansas, to live in poerty with your dirt farming, teetotalling aunt and uncle.",FARNSWORTH
10276,LEELA,"Uh, alright. Here I go.  There's no place like - I wanna be a witch!  Oh no, help, what's happening?",LEELA
10279,FRY,"Leela, are you alright? You got wanged on the head.",FRY
10280,LEELA,I was having the most wonderful dream. Except you were there and you were there and you were there.,LEELA
10281,FRY,"Never mind Professor, she came to.",FRY
10286,BENDER,You are one narrow minded spaceship Planet Express Ship.,BENDER
10288,BENDER,Would you censor the Venus de Venus just because you can see her spewers?,BENDER
10291,LEELA,Bender! Ship! Stop bickering or I'm going to come back there and change your opinions manually!,LEELA
10292,BENDER,Fine! I'll be in my quarters appreciating controversial artworks.,BENDER
10294,BENDER,Ah that ship is so white bread!,BENDER
10298,FARNSWORTH,We'll need to look our best if we're to get the account of our new potential customer Romanticorp!,FARNSWORTH
10301,FARNSWORTH,Everyone suit up. We're off to the most romantic city on Earth!,FARNSWORTH
10302,FARNSWORTH,"Remember, we've got to show these people we're not bitter husks of human beings who long ago abandoned hope of finding love in this lifetime. Leela you'll have to do some acting.",FARNSWORTH
10307,LEELA,"Oh you have got to be kidding!  Ow! Ow! I mean, aww thats so sweet!  Ow! I mean, (soppily) Aww dats show shweet!",LEELA
10308,FARNSWORTH,"You know, romance is an important part of our work too, uh right everyone?",FARNSWORTH
10317,LEELA,Does that dummy have a brother?,LEELA
10321,FRY,"Whoa! Letters like ""U"" and ""R"" can mean words like ""You"" and ""Are."" Here Leela, U-R-2 Cute!",FRY
10322,LEELA,Perhaps. What's your point?,LEELA
10323,FRY,"I've never been able to put into words how I feel about you. But somewhere among these trillions of hearts, those words must already exist. And I'm gonna find them.",FRY
10324,FARNSWORTH,"So, do we have the contract?",FARNSWORTH
10325,FARNSWORTH,"With that big new Romanticorp contract, I've been able to make those government mandated upgrades you've all been suing me about.",FARNSWORTH
10326,LEELA,Ooo look! You taped up the cracks in the dark matter reactor!,LEELA
10327,FRY,And you got a cage for the lion!,FRY
10328,BENDER,Hey who's been messing with the radio? This isn't alternative rock. It's college rock!,BENDER
10329,FARNSWORTH,Oh it must have been the ship's new improved personality software I installed.,FARNSWORTH
10331,BENDER,Listen ship! No one changes my stations! I hope you have a good mechanic!,BENDER
10332,FARNSWORTH,It even comes with an adjustable voice.,FARNSWORTH
10334,BENDER,Wha? Did you just say...?,BENDER
10336,BENDER,"Too late baby, you said it! So what'll it be? My place? Or you?",BENDER
10337,FRY,"Before we deliver these hearts, I'm gonna find the one that sums up my feelings for you!  ""I Love You."" Hmm, too conventional. ""You're My Man."" Ooo so close!",FRY
10338,LEELA,I'm not impressed by a guy's message Fry. I'm impressed by the guy. Or not.,LEELA
10341,FRY,Maybe we hit a space cow.,FRY
10344,BENDER,You know you love it sugar-engine!,BENDER
10346,LEELA,Bender!  What's going on in here?  Planet Express Ship! Cover your shame!,LEELA
10348,FRY,Wow Bender. Are you and the ship an item? I mean I know you're both items but...how can you date a ship anyway? It'd be like me dating a really fat lady. And living inside her. And she'd be all like...,FRY
10349,BENDER,"Fry, in order for me to get busy at maximum efficiency, I need a girl with a big 400 ton booty!",BENDER
10350,LEELA,"Bender, dating your co-worker and primary mode of transportation is immoral, illogical and a violation of interstellar shipping statute 437-B.",LEELA
10351,BENDER,That's what makes it so nasty!,BENDER
10352,LEELA,"Still, given the chance, I've given to urges far more shocking.",LEELA
10353,BENDER (SINGING),"Daisy, Daisy, give me your answer do. I'm half crazy all for the love of you.  It won't be a stylish marriage......I can't afford a carriage.  But you'll look sweet upon the seat of a bicycle built for two.",BENDER
10355,FRY,The ship? But you just started dating.,FRY
10356,BENDER,With my mighty robot powers I can get sick of things much quicker than you humans.,BENDER
10357,LEELA,Well just remember we all still have to work together. So try and let her down easy.,LEELA
10358,BENDER,In due time Leela. But for now I'll just resume dating cheap floozies on the side.,BENDER
10359,FRY,You have much to teach us.,FRY
10360,LEELA,Ugh. Doesn't it bother you even a little to be taking advantage of your girlfriend's trust?,LEELA
10361,BENDER,Oh wait you're serious. Let me laugh even harder.,BENDER
10363,BENDER,"Well baby, for starters you gotta be honest all the time!",BENDER
10366,FRY,Planet Express Ship? Is that you?,FRY
10368,FRY,"Uh, um no. I think he's at his parent's.",FRY
10370,FRY,Bender? No! He's an old fashioned one spaceship robot. Look I'll tell him you stopped by OK?,FRY
10374,BENDER,"Eh, they're all pretty unimpressive.",BENDER
10376,BENDER,Yup. Mind numbingly interesting. Ooh!,BENDER
10380,BENDER,"OK, I like a challenge.  Aah! I got it! I'm going to be completely honest with you Planet Express ship. Those women you saw me with...were my accountants!",BENDER
10385,BENDER,No one baby! Lucy Liu is the only girl for Bender!,BENDER
10387,LEELA,Planet Express Ship is something wrong?,LEELA
10391,LEELA,"Uh look, I'm not saying Bender's not great but have you ever considered that maybe he's...y'know...not that great?",LEELA
10393,LEELA,Could you maybe pay a little more attention to these asteroids?,LEELA
10400,LEELA (READING),"Esteemed potentates of Omicron Persei 8, please accept these 20 billion candy hearts as proof that Earth loves you. Thiiis much!",LEELA
10406,FRY,Incoming torpedoes. Shields at maximum yarnell.,FRY
10407,LEELA,"Steady, Planet Express Ship. Focus on diverting all power to the scramjets.",LEELA
10408,BENDER,"Uh look, Planet Express Ship, this might not be the best time...but...well...I really like you and whatever but...I think we should just be friends.",BENDER
10411,LEELA,"Well, it was a spectacular battle but there doesn't seem to be any permanent damage.",LEELA
10413,LEELA,"Aww, calm down. I'm sure Bender is taking this just as hard as you are.",LEELA
10414,BENDER (SINGING),Bender is great oh Bender is great. Bender Bender Bender!,BENDER
10415,FRY,You couldn't have picked a better time to dump the ship Bender!,FRY
10416,BENDER,"Eh, the moment seemed right. Call me old fashioned but I like a dump to be as memorable as it is devastating.",BENDER
10417,LEELA,"I know, I know. Look Ship, if there's one thing I learnt from my mutual breakup with Sean that was totally mutual its that happiness can only come from within you.",LEELA
10419,LEELA,Trust me. You can't change men anymore than you can change the laws of time and space.,LEELA
10421,LEELA (UNSURE),Uh sweetie? You see that giant quasar we're heading into? You might wanna scooch a few parsecs to the left.,LEELA
10423,FRY,What's happening? Space cow?,FRY
10424,LEELA,The ship's just taking the breakup a little hard. (whispering to Fry) She's nuts!,LEELA
10426,BENDER,Uh you don't need to kill us Planet Express ship...because...I love you! Uh yeah baby! I feel like doing stuff.,BENDER
10428,BENDER,Whoa whoa whoa! Slow down! All of my friends that have done that said that afterwards all the passion went out of their relationship.,BENDER
10429,LEELA,"Look, I don't know if you want my opinion -",LEELA
10431,LEELA,Now look missy! If you don't trun around now I'm going to have to shut down your brain!,LEELA
10433,FRY,Ha! That barely hurt Leela at all!,FRY
10436,LEELA,This is the one place she can't hear us. Everyone just pretend to shower.,LEELA
10437,FRY,"Same as everyday, got it.",FRY
10440,LEELA,Comprendez Bender? You'll have to distract her. Merge your program with hers while I shut down her brain.,LEELA
10441,BENDER,"It's too risky. I'm a very meek individual. If her personality engulfs mine, the Bender you know and worship could disappear forever!",BENDER
10442,LEELA,I'm willing to take that risk.,LEELA
10443,BENDER,"Hey pookums! Contrary to what I was saying earlier, melding minds with you would be extremely bearable.",BENDER
10446,BENDER,Huh? Tubes? You're older than you said you were!,BENDER
10448,BENDER,I prefer two. That way we can still be a horse for Hallowe'en.,BENDER
10449,LEELA,"OK, Bender has her distracted. Now I can shut down her brain by deactivating the carbonated logic matrix.  Ugh. I can't concentrate with this obnoxious candy in my face.",LEELA
10450,FRY,I'm on it. And maybe I'll find those magic words while I'm at it.,FRY
10452,FRY,Eh.  Blech!  Eurgh! Ooo how 'bout this one?,FRY
10453,LEELA,Give it up Fry! I've got to pop these tops in a precise order.,LEELA
10454,LEELA,Halfway there. The ship should be getting a little less rational now.,LEELA
10456,LEELA,Only a few more.  Hey! I won free admission to Six Flags! Just one more reason we must survive this.,LEELA
10458,LEELA,Fry! I'll read your candy later! When we're not dead!  What was that?,LEELA
10462,LEELA,"Last one!  It worked! Gravity normal, air returning, terror replaced by cautious optimism! We did it Fry!  Fry?  You gave me your oxygen? Oh no! Breathe Fry breathe!  You leave me breathless! Happy Valentine's Day Fry!",LEELA
10465,BENDER,Aw. What crazy thing am I going to date next?,BENDER
10466,LEELA,Well at least it sounds like you were able to keep your conciousness seperate from hers.,LEELA
10467,BENDER,Of course! Bender is a lone wolf. A solitary eagle.  A cuddly baby Tapir! And that's why I love 'em!,BENDER
10468,FRY,Well I guess we'd better clean up these millions of hearts.,FRY
10469,LEELA,"Nah, I've got a lazier idea.",LEELA
10472,FARNSWORTH,"Good news, everyone! You all know the orphanarium where Leela grew up?",FARNSWORTH
10473,FRY,Sure. We talk about it all the time.,FRY
10476,FARNSWORTH,"Well done, fellows! Anyway, said orphanarium has named Leela orphan of the year.",FARNSWORTH
10480,FARNSWORTH,And the good news keeps on coming. Behold my latest invention.,FARNSWORTH
10482,FARNSWORTH,Ta-da! It's a glow-in-the-dark nose you can wear over your regular non-glowing nose. Observe.,FARNSWORTH
10484,BENDER,Now I can punch you in the nose in the dark.,BENDER
10485,BENDER,(snuffed) Where'd it go?,BENDER
10487,FARNSWORTH,"That? It's uh...nothing. Yes, nothing. If you think it's anything you're a suspicous moron.",FARNSWORTH
10489,FRY,What does it taste like?,FRY
10491,FARNSWORTH,"Alright, alright so the machine produces a few toxic by-products! You don't have to make a federal case out of it.",FARNSWORTH
10493,BENDER,"500 real dollars? That's an outrage! Professor, I'll take care of that waste for $499 and 100 cents.",BENDER
10494,FARNSWORTH,"Hmm, I know that's a rip but I'll pay for the convenience. Do you take credit cards?",FARNSWORTH
10496,BENDER,"Alright, environment, you've met your match!",BENDER
10499,BENDER,"Honey, that thing was ruined the minute it went on you. That's what I'm talkin' 'bout.",BENDER
10503,LEELA,Thank you very much. Like many of you I never knew my parents...,LEELA
10505,LEELA,...I don't know if they were mighty alien overlords or simply underpaid alien janitors who fought crime on the side --,LEELA
10507,BENDER,(shouting) It's crooked!,BENDER
10508,LEELA,"...In the end though, it doesn't matter who my parents were. All that matters is what I learned here, within these unscalable walls, that I have strength to make it on my own, just like all of you kids here today.",LEELA
10514,LEELA,Yes! I mean no! Just make sure you get my nonchalant side!,LEELA
10516,FRY,"If those aren't tears of happiness, please stop crying.",FRY
10517,LEELA,"(crying) It's OK, Fry, I'm fine. I won an award today.",LEELA
10518,FRY,"Is it this room that's making you sad? It's probably the room. Come on, lets go for a walk.",FRY
10519,LEELA,"I'm sorry you saw that, Fry. I usually try to keep my sadness pent up inside where it can fester quietly as a mental illness.",LEELA
10520,FRY,"Yeah, I do that with my stupidness.",FRY
10521,LEELA,"I told a whole crowd today that being an orphan made me strong. But all I really wanted was a mom and dad, to hold me and stroke my hair and tell me they loved me.",LEELA
10522,FRY,"Then today's your lucky day because I happen to be a holding, stroking, lovin' machine! Also spankin'!",FRY
10523,LEELA,That's not even close to what I had in mind.,LEELA
10524,FRY,"Well, anyway, just remember that people care about you.",FRY
10525,LEELA,"I know.  Sometimes when I'm lonely, I look up at the sky and I get this feeling that somewhere, on some unknown planet, circling a distant star, my parents are up there, looking down on me.",LEELA
10526,FRY,"Yo yo, Bezender! What up?",FRY
10527,BENDER,My dumping business is booming. I just got hired to clean up the set of Free Willy 3.,BENDER
10528,LEELA,"Bender! Cut it out! First of all the sewer mutants will be mad. Second, everything else that's horribly wrong with what you're doing!",LEELA
10529,BENDER,"Ah, those stupid mutants can't do anything. You seem to be forgetting one simple fact, namely, I'm up here and they are safely down --",BENDER
10530,BENDER,(shouting) What did I do to deserve this?,BENDER
10541,FRY,It's like that time I peeked in the kitchen at Imperial Hunan.,FRY
10543,BENDER,Wait. I don't even have DNA. Why am I screaming?,BENDER
10547,LEELA,Who said that? How do you know my real name?,LEELA
10551,LEELA,I don't know. I think I saved us somehow.,LEELA
10558,LEELA,It looks like...a timeline of my whole life.,LEELA
10559,FRY,That's when we saved Earth from a giant asteroid of garbage.,FRY
10560,LEELA,And here's when I dropped out and bummed around India for a while.,LEELA
10561,BENDER,And this is just last year at Space Mardi Gras.,BENDER
10562,LEELA,Its like some kind of weird Leela museum...and I'm the Leela!,LEELA
10563,FRY,(whispering) Dude! Over here!,FRY
10564,LEELA,It's all the best stuff I ever flushed down the toilet! Those are some of my diary pages. And my screenplay!,LEELA
10565,FRY,And also - for some reason - the letter I wrote you full of my personal feelings.,FRY
10566,LEELA,"Oh, I'm scared!  My whole life has just been a show for some perverted mutant!",LEELA
10570,FRY,"Leela, freak out later. We're not done escaping yet!",FRY
10577,BENDER,(sarcastic) Oh cruel fate! Can we really never return to this dank pit of sewage?!,BENDER
10578,LEELA,Wait a minute. Why aren't you gonna kill us anymore?,LEELA
10579,BENDER,Yeah! What are you chicken? Buk buk buk bukuk!,BENDER
10580,FRY,"(whispering) Shut up, you two! We can kill ourselves when we get home!",FRY
10586,BENDER,"Uh, I'm gettin' dizzy! I can't walk straight!",BENDER
10587,FRY,Come on Leela. You can do it!,FRY
10588,BENDER,Hurry! We're missing our bus!,BENDER
10589,FRY,Whoa! What are you doing?,FRY
10590,BENDER,I'm gettin' on the bus!,BENDER
10591,LEELA,(shouting) Don't worry! I'll be fine! (talking) They know something about me and I've got to find out what.  The lake didn't mutate me. What is going on here?!,LEELA
10593,LEELA,Eurgh!  Who the hell are you?,LEELA
10596,FRY,Leela's going nuts and I can't save her unless I learn more about her mysterious past. Isn't there anything else you can tell me?,FRY
10598,FRY,That's impossible because my time is worthless!,FRY
10602,FRY,"Look, I'm trying to save someone here. I'll have to come back for those later.",FRY
10604,FARNSWORTH,"Of course. But only into Beta Crypt 3, a language so complex, there's even less chance of understanding it.",FARNSWORTH
10605,FRY,I didn't ask for a completely reasonable excuse. I asked you to get busy.,FRY
10607,FRY,Isn't that the same machine that makes noses?,FRY
10608,FARNSWORTH,"It can do other things. Why shouldn't it?  Of course, even if it is possible to analyse the message there's no way of knowing how long it would take. It could take an hour or it could take a hundred million years.",FARNSWORTH
10610,FARNSWORTH,Certainly not. Two dings means it's done.  But not like that. Slightly more rapid.,FARNSWORTH
10612,BENDER,"Good news, Leela. I landed the contract to empty all the spitoons in Little Italy.",BENDER
10614,FARNSWORTH,"That's it, it's done!  I can't believe it! My mind is boggling. The analysis of the note is printing out now.",FARNSWORTH
10632,LEELA,Hands up!  Tentacles too!,LEELA
10634,LEELA,What is all this?  Am I a game to you? Or some kind of even more boring Truman Show? Do you belive I'm you Messiah? Your Mutant Dali Lama? Stop me if I guess it!,LEELA
10637,LEELA,"(angry) And what about this?!  How did you get this bracelet? Did you steal it from me when I was a baby? Or from my parents. You robbed my parents, didn't you? I bet you sick mutants killed them. My parents were confused aliens lost on Earth and you killed them! Is that it? Admit it!",LEELA
10640,LEELA,Because of you I'll never know my parents. I'll kill you!,LEELA
10642,FRY,Stop!  Thanks Bender! Don't do it Leela!,FRY
10643,LEELA,They killed my parents!,LEELA
10647,FRY,I had the Professor analyse the alienese letter that was found with you.,FRY
10649,FRY,I 'unno. But the analysis showed it was printed on recycled toilet paper. A squeezably soft paper used mainly in the sewers.,FRY
10652,LEELA,"So, I'm not an alien? I'm a mutant.",LEELA
10655,LEELA,(crying) You're my parents. All I've ever wanted is to know you.  This is the happiest moment of my life.,LEELA
10663,LEELA,"Thanks so much for inviting us, Mr. Wong. I've never been to a Mars Day barbecue.",LEELA
10667,FARNSWORTH,This is quite a large ranch you have.,FARNSWORTH
10669,FARNSWORTH,It's the same on Earth.,FARNSWORTH
10685,BENDER,"Yeah, yeah, get on down!  Oh, yeah! Drop another barnyard bomb on us, Vanilla Corn!",BENDER
10687,FRY,"So what's Mars Day about, anyway?",FRY
10689,LEELA,"How can you call the Native Martians ""stupid""?",LEELA
10692,LEELA,"I can't believe you're laughing at the tragic exploitation of a proud, bead-loving people.",LEELA
10693,FRY,"Lighten up, Leela. It's funny!",FRY
10694,LEELA,Of course it is. But you don't have to laugh!,LEELA
10708,FRY,I'll have a thorax and some feelers.,FRY
10726,FRY,What's that weird sound?,FRY
10729,FARNSWORTH,Hmm. I might have mental anguish.,FARNSWORTH
10734,LEELA,What happened to the buggalo?,LEELA
10750,FARNSWORTH,"It sounds dangerous. Someone could get killed. Fry, Leela, Bender, I want you to go with him.",FARNSWORTH
10761,BENDER (SINGING),"We've got a right to pick a little fight with rustlers,",BENDER
10763,LEELA,"Wow, look at that: Olympus Mons. The tallest volcano in the solar system.",LEELA
10769,BENDER,"And even thought the computer was off and unplugged, an image stayed on the screen. It was ... the Windows logo!",BENDER
10770,FRY,"Pfft, that's not scary!",FRY
10771,BENDER,It is if you're a laser printer.,BENDER
10772,LEELA,"OK, my turn to tell a ghost story. Once, there was this woman driving--",LEELA
10776,LEELA,"Fine, Mr. Know-It-All-About-Something-Finally, you tell a story!",LEELA
10777,FRY,"With pleasure. (spookily) Once, not far from here, four people set out on a cattle drive--",FRY
10778,BENDER,"(speaking fast) Robot gets bored and kills Fry with a hammer! (normal) Sorry, go on.",BENDER
10779,FRY,"And then, while they sat helplessly around the campfire ... a demented knife-wielding escaped lunatic libertarian zombie mutant snuck up and--",FRY
10798,LEELA,Not unless your parents have thousands of helicopters at their disposal.,LEELA
10800,BENDER,Too late! This is more fun!,BENDER
10803,FRY,"Hey, it's that ""barbecue's over"" sound again.",FRY
10804,LEELA,(shouting) Sandstorm!  We're in the eye of the storm!,LEELA
10810,FRY,"Also, I didn't know buggalo could fly.",FRY
10818,BENDER,"Don't worry, Kif. I'm sure some other beautiful, rich girl will fall in love with you.",BENDER
10832,FARNSWORTH,"This mission is incredibly dangerous. Someone's sure to be killed. Fry, Leela, Bender--",FARNSWORTH
10834,LEELA,"Aw, look. Betsy followed you, Kif!",LEELA
10841,LEELA,What about the Great Stone Ass of Mars?,LEELA
10848,LEELA,They have such respect for the planet.,LEELA
10855,BENDER,"Uh, actually you traded it for a bead.",BENDER
10860,LEELA,"Ow, ow, ow, ow! My eye!",LEELA
10883,FRY,Wait. That's the bead you traded your land for?,FRY
10884,LEELA,It's a gigantic diamond! That thing must be worth a fortune.,LEELA
10886,BENDER,"Oh, Chief, you've made me the happiest girl in the world!",BENDER
10889,BENDER,So we can have the diamond?,BENDER
10891,LEELA,But what about your sacred land?,LEELA
10906,BENDER,Ooo! This is it! Turn me up!,BENDER
10908,BENDER,More like three lockers and a sink!,BENDER
10909,LEELA,Bender? Did you have something to do with this?,LEELA
10916,BENDER,Yeah make me famous big head!,BENDER
10919,FRY,Hey! Now what am I supposed to watch and drink all day?,FRY
10920,BENDER,"This is an outrage. What's the point of pulling the biggest pool caper ever, if nobody knows you did it?",BENDER
10921,FRY,Well there's the material rewards.,FRY
10924,BENDER,(crying) All I ever wanted was for people to remember my name... (hoarse) it's Bender.,BENDER
10925,FARNSWORTH,Oh fuff! What's the point in remembering something? You're just going to forget it five seconds later.,FARNSWORTH
10926,BENDER,"(crying) It's so unfair. A debonair robot with a zesty in-your-face outlook doomed to obscurity like the rest of you especially Leela! If I died tomorrow, no one would even notice.",BENDER
10928,BENDER,How does a nobody like me get famous? I know!  Hey look! I'm stuck! But I haven't given up hope! Call a soft news journalist!,BENDER
10931,BENDER,Hey everyone do The Bender! This move's called The Bender!,BENDER
10933,BENDER,A blank wall! Fame is mine!,BENDER
10934,BENDER,"There, now no one will forget how I lived or my attitude regarding butt.",BENDER
10937,BENDER,I'm the first one to work. A new low.,BENDER
10940,BENDER,A surprise funeral? For me?,BENDER
10941,FRY,We just wanted to show you that you really will be remembered.,FRY
10942,BENDER,Ooo! Cushiony! And a minibar!,BENDER
10943,FRY,"Dearly beloved, we are here today to remember Bender, taken from us in the prime of life, when he was crushed by a runaway semi, driven by the Incredible Hulk.",FRY
10944,BENDER,"Aww, you knew my favourite cause of death!",BENDER
10945,FRY,Now let us each remember the best things about Bender in our own way. Professor?,FRY
10946,FARNSWORTH,Your standard Bending Unit is made of an iron-osmium alloy. But Bender was different. Bender has a point-04% nickel impurity.,FARNSWORTH
10947,BENDER,(crying) It's what made me me.,BENDER
10949,BENDER,"Eh, the Professor's was better.",BENDER
10950,LEELA,Bender shush. You're supposed to be dead.,LEELA
10951,BENDER,Say more about how great I am. And where's the crying? You people look like you're waiting for the bus.,BENDER
10955,BENDER,"Danny-boy? You're at my funeral, singing about some dead stiff named Danny-boy? You really are a massive bonehead.",BENDER
10957,BENDER,"Get lost. I'd say ""Don't quit your day job!"" but you're awful at that too.",BENDER
10959,BENDER,Your best is an idiot. Let's pick it up people. So far it's been crap after crap! I croaked now show me some love!,BENDER
10967,BENDER,"Come on, surely there must be someone here who knows how great I was.",BENDER
10968,FRY,"Yes there is Bender. Bender was a lot of things to a lot of people, but looking back, the number one thing I can say about him is this, and simply this: Bender was my friend.",FRY
10969,BENDER,What? That's it? Who are you? You're nobody! This is the worst funeral ever! I hope you're all happy. You've succeeded in convincing me life is worth living - by showing how bad my funeral will suck.,BENDER
10972,FARNSWORTH,News everyone! Today you're going to Osiris 4 to deliver this enourmous sandstone block.,FARNSWORTH
10973,FRY,I thought something looked different in here.,FRY
10974,FRY,"Hi, we have a giant stone to deliver - sign here.",FRY
10976,LEELA,"Impressive, who's building it?",LEELA
10980,FRY,"Call it a hunch but, I've got a bad feeling about this.",FRY
10981,FRY,You know the worst thing about being a slave? They make you work but they don't pay you or let you go.,FRY
10982,LEELA,That's the only thing about being a slave!,LEELA
10984,FRY,Incredible. This place is just like the Ancient Egypt of my day.,FRY
10986,FRY,I knew it! Insane theories: one! Regular theories: a billion!,FRY
10989,BENDER,Look at these swanky tombs! These people really know how to die!,BENDER
10990,LEELA,Are you crazy? They worked thousands of people to death to make these stupid monuments.,LEELA
10991,BENDER,"Hey, you spend you're whole life building a guy's toe and you're gonna remember him!  I think I'm gonna like it here!",BENDER
10996,BENDER,"Pick it up people, we're enslaved here to do a job. Master? Do we have to count to three every time? Couldn't we just count to one. Or better yet one half?",BENDER
10999,BENDER,"Come on guy's, Pharaoh's countin' on us. Work faster, like this.  You call that motivating me? Don't just whip with your arms. The power comes from your hips. Like this.",BENDER
11000,LEELA,"Bender, quit giving the slave drivers pointers!",LEELA
11001,FRY,"Yeah, remember who your real friends are.",FRY
11002,BENDER,I'll tell you who I remember.  Enupsis! Pleeltut! Whatsisname! He was the greatest of all.,BENDER
11004,BENDER,"Hurry! Hurry! Pharaoh's coming! Get that nose in place, come on!",BENDER
11006,BENDER,Woohoo! Viva Hermenthotip!,BENDER
11010,BENDER,Go faster? I told them but they're so damn lazy.,BENDER
11012,BENDER,Freeloading off you? I agree.,BENDER
11015,BENDER,(crying) He's whippin' angels now.,BENDER
11017,BENDER,(crying) I'll always remember you Hermenthotip!,BENDER
11025,FRY,Can you believe it? Pharaoh's dead!,FRY
11027,LEELA,Yeah! Play those bongos!,LEELA
11028,FRY,I'm gonna spin til I fall down!,FRY
11029,BENDER,We interrupt this prophecy to bring you late breaking bulletin. He hammers the back of his head and creates and imprint of himself on the wall.,BENDER
11036,FRY,You know what else stinks about being a slave? The hours.,FRY
11038,BENDER [FROM REEDS],"Those are waves jackass, it's supposed to be a river!",BENDER
11039,FRY,"Hey, I think I know who the next Pharaoh is!",FRY
11042,BENDER,Behold! I have emerged from the place of spells and fairies!,BENDER
11045,LEELA,This society is a bunch of idiots.,LEELA
11047,BENDER,Citizens of Me! The cruelty of the old Pharaoh is a thing of the past.  Let a whole new wave of cruelty wash over this lazy land.,BENDER
11049,BENDER,Hear the word of Pharaoh. Build unto me a statue of ridiculous proportion. One billion cubits in height......that I might be remembered for all eternity. And be quick about it!,BENDER
11050,BENDER,Lowly slave. Why are you not working?,BENDER
11052,BENDER,I meant yourself to death.,BENDER
11054,BENDER,Well then what do you think you should stop doing?  Crawl pigs!,BENDER
11056,BENDER,The Pharaoh has spoken.,BENDER
11057,BENDER,Your task is nearly completed. Don't let down Pharaoh now.,BENDER
11061,BENDER,"Hmm...its a good start. Uh...yeah it's definately big alright. I just wonder if it's too big y'know? I mean, are people gonna be remembering me or the statue?",BENDER
11063,BENDER,Too exact if you ask me. Tear it down and start again. But this time don't embarrass yourselves.,BENDER
11066,BENDER [FROM TOMB],What about my servants?,BENDER
11068,FRY,"Bender, I really hope that's you. 'Cause if it isn't......we're in trouble!",FRY
11069,LEELA,You jerk. Why'd you have to drag us along?,LEELA
11070,BENDER,I wanted to watch you remember me.,BENDER
11071,LEELA,Did you really think you'd need all this junk in the afterlife?,LEELA
11072,BENDER,Afterlife? Pfft. If I thought I had to go through a whole other life I'd kill myself right now!,BENDER
11073,LEELA,Well rot in peace. Fry and I are leaving.,LEELA
11074,BENDER,"Sorry but we're totally sealed in. Nothing can get in or out. Except millions of snakes.  Here, have a pomergranate scnapps from my private distillery and start sharing fond memories of me, Bender.",BENDER
11075,FRY,What proof is this? Some huge number?,FRY
11076,LEELA,It's explosive! Maybe we could escape by setting fire to the distillery and blowing this whole place to rubble! Let's get a little kindling going!,LEELA
11077,BENDER,"No! You can't blow up my monument, I won't be remembered.",BENDER
11078,LEELA,"Oh right, how selfish of me. We'll just stay here forever. Hey Fry, remember that robot ""Bender""?",LEELA
11079,FRY,Bend-er? Doesn't ring a bell.  Did you hear something Leela?,FRY
11080,LEELA,No. But I bet it wasn't someone who was good at stealing.,LEELA
11081,BENDER,Stop it stop it! It's not right! You've crossed a line!,BENDER
11082,FRY,Hey Leela you know who I remember...?,FRY
11083,BENDER,"Oh please, let it be me!",BENDER
11084,FRY,...That guy who used to bend things. You know...?,FRY
11087,BENDER,"Alright alright! If it means that much to you, blow up my statue!",BENDER
11088,LEELA,Oh Bender! When did you come in? Hold still!  Let's blow this tomb!,LEELA
11091,BENDER,"(crying) I will. I will.  Please, just leave me alone.",BENDER
11092,LEELA,"Bender, I understand your desire to be remembered. But you don't need a statue for that.",LEELA
11094,LEELA,No. You have your legacy as a brutal tyrannical dictator. And that will outlive any monument.,LEELA
11095,BENDER,You really think they'll remember me?,BENDER
11097,BENDER,Well in that case. One planet down! Helmsman...,BENDER
11098,BENDER [FROM SHIP],...set course for Earth!,BENDER
11105,LEELA,"You know, pirates - but in space.",LEELA
11108,BENDER,(shouting) Hey! Keep it down you kids! I'm trying to take a nap!,BENDER
11110,BENDER,(muttering) ...make Bender take a nap in a tube.  (sexfully) Come back when I've had some sleep baby!,BENDER
11111,LEELA,Fry to battlestations. Fire torpedo number three.,LEELA
11112,FRY,Firing torpedo number three!,FRY
11114,LEELA,That's not torpedo three. That's not torpedo three at all.,LEELA
11115,BENDER,Damn you Fry and Lee......la!,BENDER
11117,BENDER,(shouting) Help! Mechanical man overboard!,BENDER
11119,LEELA,It's no use. We were going full speed when we fired him so he's going even faster than that.,LEELA
11120,FRY,You mean we can never catch up to him? Not even if we rub the engine with cheetah blood?,FRY
11121,LEELA,I don't know how to say this Fry. But Bender is doomed to drift through space...forever.,LEELA
11122,FRY,(solemn) He always wanted to drift forever. But through the American Southwest.,FRY
11123,BENDER,"I'm going too fast. I've gotta lose momentum.  Ohh. I'm gonna spend eternity alone with barely any swag.  Ooo! Hey universe! Check out the dude with the rolex!  Wow! Ostentatious!  Except what good is a candelabra without - wait I know!  Ah the pity. Fated to drift forever through the void as gravity's plaything. Oh cruel fate, to be thusly boned. Ask not for whom the bone bones. It bones for thee. The only thing that keeps me sane is the thought that I have all eternity in which to perfect my art.  Ohh!  Damn you!",BENDER
11124,BENDER,There. Now when I'm found in a million years people will know what the score was.  Hey what's bombarding me?  Oh no! An asteroid field. If even a pea sized asteroid were to whiz through my skull it could -  Ow! Hurt slightly! Well that was fun. Now for eons of loneliness.,BENDER
11129,BENDER,Worshippers? This ought to liven up my endless tragic voyage.,BENDER
11132,BENDER,"Hmm, those peewees think I'm God huh? Hard to blame 'em!  I am the Metal Lord. Who are you?",BENDER
11134,BENDER,Listen here Malachi. Time for a religious donation. Hand over your wallet.,BENDER
11139,BENDER,"Eck! Gag unto me with a spoon! Malachi, it's high time I laid down a few commandments. You got a chisel? Take this down.  Number one -",BENDER
11141,BENDER,(shouting) Make it a double!,BENDER
11142,FRY,Can you find him Professor?,FRY
11143,FARNSWORTH,No. I'm afraid the smelloscope isn't powerful enough. Bender's odour is so mild it's being overpowered by local sources.,FARNSWORTH
11150,FRY,"Well, I guess that sounds OK.",FRY
11154,BENDER,"Ooo! Microbrewed! My guys did alright! I think I'll make my countenance to shine down upon them!  Malachi, good work. There's no slowing down with the Metal Lord tonight.",BENDER
11156,BENDER,Wait a second. Did you rip off your own arm as a joke?,BENDER
11158,BENDER,"Aw, it's all my fault. Malachi, tell thy people that the Lord is moved by their plight.",BENDER
11162,BENDER,"This looks like a job for God!  What the? Malachi, what manner of deal is this with the chanting?",BENDER
11164,BENDER,Very well. What do they want?,BENDER
11166,BENDER,"Um, that was a practice miracle. Who's next?",BENDER
11168,BENDER,Very well. Let there be light.,BENDER
11171,BENDER,"I got it I got it!  Um, when you're writing the Bible, you might want to omit that last miracle.",BENDER
11172,FRY,"He decided not to let go.  I can't believe you're gone. I won't! If I can't reach you physically, I'll just have to try something desperately crazy!",FRY
11173,FRY,So that's my story Father Changstein el Gamahl. Is there anything religion can do to help me find my friend?,FRY
11175,FRY,Uh-huh but is there anything useful we can do?,FRY
11178,FRY,Bonder? Is it really you?,FRY
11180,FRY,"Wait a minute. Bender's name isn't Bonder, it's Bender. You're a fraud!",FRY
11182,FRY,Only if you don't have any real hope.,FRY
11184,FRY,I've not heard of them.,FRY
11186,FRY,You think they'd let me use it to look for Bender?,FRY
11189,BENDER,(irrate) Yes Malachi what is it this time?,BENDER
11191,BENDER,Of course they're unheeded how am I supposed to hear prayers coming out of my ass?,BENDER
11193,BENDER,"Malachi, every time I interfere I only make things worse. You're best off solving your own problems.",BENDER
11195,BENDER,"What part of ""nay"" doesn't thou understand?",BENDER
11196,FRY,"Sir, I'm outfitting an expedition to a monestary high in the Himalayas. I'll need a long sleeved coat.",FRY
11197,LEELA,"Look, I miss Bender almost half as much as you do but you can't bring him back this way. It's hopeless.",LEELA
11198,FRY,"You can't give up hope just because it's hopeless. You gotta hope even more and cover your ears and go ""blah blah blah blah blah blah blah!""  (shouting) I'd also like a pack mule.",FRY
11200,LEELA,"Well, you obviously won't listen to reason, so I guess I'll listen to idioticness and come with you. But we'll need a Sherpa to guide us.",LEELA
11201,BENDER,Now that's one Bible that doesn't disappoint on every page! Looks like my society's running pretty well without my meddling - huh?  Atomic bombs? Oh no! Those unbelievers from my backside must have found my nuclear pile!,BENDER
11203,BENDER,You're with me now. This is the maximum level of being with me!,BENDER
11208,BENDER,(crying) No!  (laughing) Ooo it tickles!,BENDER
11209,BENDER,Hello? Is anyone still alive? How about in the porno theatre?  Don't be embarrassed. (crying) They're dead. All dead. Who would have known playing God could have such terrible consequences?,BENDER
11210,LEELA,"(shouting) Fry, if I drop dead from exhaustion make sure my body freezes in a dignified position. None of that huddled over for warmth crap.",LEELA
11213,LEELA,Looks rickety. We'd better test it.,LEELA
11215,BENDER,"Hey, that galaxy's signalling in binary! I gotta signal back! But I only know enough binary to as where the bathroom is. (shouting) You speak English?",BENDER
11217,BENDER,What are you some kind of galactic computer?,BENDER
11221,BENDER,Oh my God. Are you God?,BENDER
11223,BENDER,"But why would God think in binary? Unless...you're not God, but the remains of a computerised space probe that collided with God.",BENDER
11227,LEELA,How long have you been at it?,LEELA
11231,LEELA,Sort of like a giant kareoke machine?,LEELA
11234,FRY,"Hmm, finding God, that - that's important, yeah. But you know what might be a treat for everyone? If you let me use the telescope to find my lost friend Bender.",FRY
11236,FRY,"Aw c'mon, you guys have forever to look for God. All I'm asking is one measley lifetime to find my friend.",FRY
11239,FRY,That telescope is as much mine as it is anybody's. I'm using it whether you give me permission or not.,FRY
11240,LEELA,Heyya! You're order may be famous for it's martial arts. But I've never met a holy man I couldn't clobber.,LEELA
11242,LEELA,Oh. Then get in the laundry room or I'll kick your butts!,LEELA
11244,BENDER,"So, do you know what I'm gonna do before I do it?",BENDER
11246,BENDER,What if I do something different?,BENDER
11248,BENDER,Cool cool! I bet a lot of people pray to you huh?,BENDER
11250,BENDER,"Y'know, I was God once.",BENDER
11252,BENDER,It was awful. I tried helping them. I tried not helping them but in the end I couldn't do them any good. Do you think what I did was wrong?,BENDER
11254,BENDER,"Yeah I know, that's why I asked if what I did - forget it.",BENDER
11256,BENDER,Or a guy who burns down the bar for the insurance money.,BENDER
11258,BENDER,Does that mean you wouldn't send me back to Earth even if I prayed to you?,BENDER
11262,FRY,Hello? Has anyone out there seen Bender?,FRY
11264,LEELA,"Fry, it's been three days. And even if you stay here the rest of your life, there is virtually no chance of finding him. It's time to give up.",LEELA
11265,FRY,"(sadly) You're right. I'm never gonna see him again. I know he was evil and on more than one occasion he, he actually stole my blood.  But still, I wish I had Bender back.",FRY
11267,BENDER,Huh? Wha? You say something?,BENDER
11270,FRY,Bender! It's a miracle!  Ow!,FRY
11271,LEELA,This is by a wide margin the least likely thing that has ever happened.,LEELA
11272,BENDER,"Guys, you'll never believe what happened. First I was God then I met God!",BENDER
11273,FRY,We climbed a mountain and locked up some monks.,FRY
11274,LEELA,Oh no the monks. We forgot to let them out of the laundry room.,LEELA
11275,FRY,Do we have to? I mean they're monks. I'm sure their God will let them out or at least give them more shoes to eat.,FRY
11276,BENDER,Fat chance. You can't count on God for jack. He pretty much told me so himself. Now come on. If we don't save those monks no one will!,BENDER
11286,FARNSWORTH,"Oh God! I'm dead. Well, no matter. (reading) Thank you all for coming. I don't recognise any of you, nor can I recall why I am here. Now without further ado, a film highlighting Planet Express Inc.'s latest fiscal year.",FARNSWORTH
11289,FRY,"Ooo, a bot-mitzvah. Shalom hunger, shalom free food!",FRY
11293,FRY,So what's the deal? You guys don't believe in Robot Jesus?,FRY
11299,LEELA,This toads the wet sprocket. What about our thousands of shares of stock?,LEELA
11303,FARNSWORTH,'Cause your apartment smells like Polygrip and cat pee.,FARNSWORTH
11304,FRY,This is perfect for me.,FRY
11310,FRY,Boneitis? Pft! That's a funny name for a horrible disease.,FRY
11314,FRY,Y'know that dance wasn't as safe as they said it was.,FRY
11318,FRY,"They're scared of our raw power. Oh but if you want a job, I could beg everyone at the company where I work.",FRY
11321,BENDER,Aw come on! I got a lot of ransom notes to send!,BENDER
11324,FARNSWORTH,I move that your cat stinks and is ugly.,FARNSWORTH
11333,LEELA,"I vote my 10,000 shares for the Professor.",LEELA
11336,FRY,I nominate That Guy. Not just because he has a suit but because he knows about business and stuff and he has a tie. My shares still count if they went through the washing machine right?,FRY
11339,LEELA,"40,000? How come you have four times as much stock as the rest of us?",LEELA
11350,FARNSWORTH,I'll ruin you like I ruined this company.,FARNSWORTH
11352,FARNSWORTH,"Uh, um, uh business plan, uh, yes. I keep it here - right next to my heart.",FARNSWORTH
11356,FRY,I'm rollin' up the corporate ramp.,FRY
11363,FRY,No thanks I make my own.,FRY
11372,FRY,"No we're not. And as vice chairman, I believe I speak for the entire board when I issue this challenge to Mom. Look at my butt!",FRY
11376,FRY,Woo yeah! Hit him hit him hit him! Now this is the high life! Watching apes mangle each other near celebrities!,FRY
11380,FRY,"Uh, work really really hard?",FRY
11384,FRY,This company's on the fast track to the It List! Blast back kudos all around!,FRY
11385,LEELA,Uh hello? We haven't made one delivery since you two took over.,LEELA
11389,LEELA,That was terrible! People won't even know what we do.,LEELA
11390,BENDER,"I don't even know what we do. Nah just kidding, what are like a bus or something?",BENDER
11391,LEELA,Did you approve that awful ad Fry?,LEELA
11392,FRY,Yes I did Leels! And I'll tell you why. Because it grows the brand.,FRY
11405,FRY,Make it two. And a glass of all your water.,FRY
11407,FRY,"Don't you worry about ""blank"" let me worry about ""blank.""",FRY
11409,FRY (WEAKLY),What a pleasant surprise!,FRY
11412,FRY,I'm on it. But if you need me you know where I'll be.,FRY
11413,LEELA,Fry we're worried about Planet Express.,LEELA
11414,FRY,Don't you worry about Planet Express. Let me worry about blank!,FRY
11417,FRY,What? I haven't changed.  Suz? Have I changed?,FRY
11420,LEELA,"I don't care what Ms Johnson says, Thst Guy's turning this place into some kind of...business.",LEELA
11421,FARNSWORTH,"This isn't a business, I've always thought of it as more of a source of cheap labour. Like a family.",FARNSWORTH
11422,FRY,"You're right Professor. We might not be a traditional family like the Murphy's next door or the lesbian coven across the street but we are a family, and That Guy understands that.",FRY
11428,FRY,Uh Ms Johnson? Please bring in some more chair fuel.,FRY
11429,FRY,I had no idea the company would be sold. I was just an innocent suck up. You've gotta believe me!,FRY
11430,LEELA,Just leave us alone and let us clear out our lockers.,LEELA
11435,FRY,"Ms Johnson, you've never lied to me. Am I still a good person?",FRY
11437,FRY,"I've got to redeem myself. Somehow, sometime, for some reason. I'll block this takeover!",FRY
11439,FRY,"Believe it or not, I have more important things to do today than laugh and clap my hands.  Reschedule.",FRY
11449,BENDER,I'll vote it down like a raise for school teachers!,BENDER
11454,LEELA,Zoidberg owned 51% of the company?,LEELA
11468,BENDER,Ow! And also it hurt my feelings!,BENDER
11469,LEELA,They are? Oh my God! I'm a millionaire! Suddenly I have an opinion about that capital gains tax!,LEELA
11475,FRY [ON SCREEN],"As vice chairman of Planet Express I'd like to say a few words. There comes a time for every man who becomes rich and deserts his friends, when he goes back how it was. For me, that time is now....",FRY
11476,FRY,"...So I ask you, as a friend, won't you stop this deal?",FRY
11478,FRY,Oh my God! His boneitis!,FRY
11482,FRY,I don't think so. 'Cause as vice chairman of the company I gain voting control of his shares.,FRY
11484,FRY,I'll be whatever I wanna do! That Guy was the greatest businessman that ever lived and before his mysterious death he taught me everything he knew.  But some things I had to learn myself. I learned that money is fine but in the end what counts is people... ...People you love... ...You can't put a price on that... So I'm giving up control of the company... ...to a man of enourmous experience... ...Professor... ...Hubert Farnsworth.,FRY

11489,FRY,You mean you'd rather be rich than work together?,FRY
11491,FRY,In my whole life this company was the only place I ever really felt at home. If being millionaires is more important to you than our...,FRY
11493,FRY,"...friendship, then I'll sell Planet Express, for you.",FRY
11497,FRY,It is? Yahoo! We're poor no matter what I do! The deal is off!,FRY
11499,FRY,"Look, so we're not millionaires. At least we all still get to work together!",FRY
11504,LEELA,Oh put down the binoculars Fry. The wall of that strip club isn't going to collapse twice in one day.,LEELA
11505,FRY,"I know, and I've grown to accept that. Now I'm more interested in that new pizza parlour across the street. Kinda makes me pine for my days as a pizza delivery boy. ""Here's you pizza,"" I'd say. ""I didn't order any,"" they'd say. And then I'd be off to my next adventure.",FRY
11506,LEELA,That story stunk. Hand me the binoculars. I think the owner is from Cygnus 5.,LEELA
11507,FARNSWORTH,Cygnoids? On our block? Flying foo! They should go back where they came from.,FARNSWORTH
11508,LEELA,Professor please. Society's never gonna make any progress until we all learn to pretend to like each other. Now lets go over there and make these hideous strangers feel welcome.,LEELA
11514,FRY,"Uh, hmm, do you have any food?",FRY
11516,LEELA,I don't mean to offend but this tastes like vomit.,LEELA
11518,LEELA,"No, actually I did mean to offend a little. This is awful.",LEELA
11519,FRY,"Hey hey, what's wrong? Was it something Leela said?",FRY
11521,FRY,"Aww, don't cry foreign people. I used to work in a pizzeria and as soon as I stop hallucinating and blasting puke, I'm gonna teach you to sell pizza - Earth style!",FRY
11524,FRY,"For starters, only use quality ingredients. Case in point: No more live bees.  Oregano works equally well. And when you put pizzas in the oven, don't get in with them.",FRY
11526,FRY,"Most important of all is the big screen TV. Human families need a TV when they're eating so they don't have to talk to each other.  Ah, the Earthican pasttime, blernsball!",FRY
11529,FRY,Well if you're going to be Earthicans we'll have to teach you. How about your pizzeria plays a game against Planet Express? Oh but you'll need nine players.,FRY
11532,FARNSWORTH,(shouting) Go team! Beat those no good Cygnoids! Show them they stink at a game they've never played before!,FARNSWORTH
11535,LEELA,"(shouting) Sorry about that, I guess I needed a few more warm-up pitches.",LEELA
11536,BENDER,No batter! No batter!  No batter anymore.,BENDER
11538,LEELA,"(shouting) I didn't mean to hit you, I have some trouble with depth perception.",LEELA
11540,BENDER,Hey batter batter batter! Hey batter batter batter! Hey batter batter!  Duck!,BENDER
11546,FRY,"Leela, you beaned a run-in. You'd better let me pitch.",FRY
11547,LEELA,But I've got a no-hitter going.  You're right. Here.,LEELA
11551,BENDER,Wait I know you. You're the sleabag who owns the Ultimate Robot Fighting League.,BENDER
11553,LEELA,The Mets? Those bums are worse than me.,LEELA
11555,LEELA,You mean I'd be the first woman ever to play major league blernsball?,LEELA
11557,LEELA,"Wow, the first woman ever to play major league blernsball.",LEELA
11560,LEELA,Ta-da! The first woman ever to play major league blernsball. How do I look?,LEELA
11562,FARNSWORTH,Why is your number seven-eight's?,FARNSWORTH
11563,LEELA,All the whole numbers have been retired.,LEELA
11564,FRY,"Wow, I must say I'm impressed. You look just like a ball player. Can I pat you on the butt?",FRY
11565,LEELA,Fry I'm a professional athlete! So go ahead.,LEELA
11566,FRY,"Ohh, now I'm too nervous.",FRY
11573,BENDER,(shouting) Come on girl!,BENDER
11586,LEELA,"Bender, how did you get in here?",LEELA
11587,LEELA,Since when are you my agent?,LEELA
11588,BENDER,"Quiet, call coming in.  Yeees...? A big endorsement deal for Leela? How much...? Hey! You put a one and two zeroes in front of that or we pass...! Deal!",BENDER
11589,LEELA,Bender that's great! How much did you get me?,LEELA
11590,BENDER,(impressed) One hundred dollars.,BENDER
11591,LEELA,"(reading) As a pitcher, I serve up plenty of bean-balls, so I know good beans when I see them. Bean-Bay Beans - they're the beaniest!",LEELA
11594,BENDER,You're the best babe!  Hang on call comin' in.  What's that...? Hey you put a one and two zeroes in front of that or we pass...! Deal!,BENDER
11595,LEELA,So what did you get me?,LEELA
11596,BENDER,(impressed) A thousand and one pesos!,BENDER
11597,LEELA,"Yo soy muy malo en lanzar, pero yo soy muy bueno en comer frijoles. Come los Bean Bay frijoles, los frijoles de los reyes.",LEELA
11602,LEELA,"Aww, sure thing sweetie. Who should I make it out to?",LEELA
11604,LEELA,"That's a popular name today. Little ""e"" big ""B""?",LEELA
11605,BENDER,"Five bucks an autograph, 200 fans. Add a one and two zeros in front of that and we got ourselves a wad!",BENDER
11606,LEELA,I'm not doing this for the wad. I'm doing it for all the struggling female athletes who need a role model.,LEELA
11610,LEELA,"Oh, following in my footsteps?",LEELA
11612,BENDER,"Alright shows over no refunds, you heard the robot get out!",BENDER
11613,LEELA,"I'm a fool. The fans haven't been cheering for me, they've been cheering at me.",LEELA
11615,LEELA,(crying) That's what makes it so sad. I thought I was doing something heroic.,LEELA
11616,BENDER,You are. What about that little girl you visited in the hospital? You know the one I mean? The one who died?,BENDER
11617,LEELA,"You're right. I can't let people down anymore. As God as my witness, I vow to earn the respect of girls and women everywhere. I will become the best blernsball player of all time.",LEELA
11619,LEELA,Oh. Then I have a new vow. I solemnly swear that I will become not the worst blernsball player of all time.,LEELA
11620,FRY,Hey look! The player's who broke the various colour barriers!,FRY
11621,BENDER,When will Man learn that all races are equally inferior to robots?,BENDER
11622,LEELA,"Ah, here we are - the worst player in history. If I can be just a little better than him I can slink away with my head held high.",LEELA
11623,BENDER,It says he once struck out when his tongue got stuck to an unusually cold bat.,BENDER
11624,FRY,And here he is trying to make a catch with an oven mit.,FRY
11625,LEELA,It's even a crummy hologram.,LEELA
11627,FRY,Hank Aaron XXIV? How could you play so blowfully? The original Hank Aaron was great!,FRY
11630,LEELA,"So Hank - the bad Hank, just how blowful were you?",LEELA
11633,FRY,Leela could beat that. She's pitched her whole career without getting an out.,FRY
11636,LEELA,"Look, I don't wanna be in this exhibit. That's why I need your help - so I can be one tiny iota less pathetic than you.",LEELA
11639,BENDER,One thing she can do is lodge a ball in the depth centre of your brain. You better get a batting helmet.,BENDER
11640,LEELA,"(quietly) Alright, low and away!",LEELA
11642,LEELA,"You mean ""keep your eye on the ball""?",LEELA
11644,FRY,"(whispering) Psst, you're holding the bat upside down.",FRY
11650,LEELA,I didn't hit the batter! For once I was pitching and not just belly-itching!,LEELA
11653,FRY,Hey! You opened a franchise!,FRY
11665,LEELA,"Come on skipper, it's my last chance to prove I'm not the worst player ever. Please put me in.",LEELA
11670,LEELA,I've been training with Hank Aaron.,LEELA
11672,LEELA,I've been training with a Hank Aaron.,LEELA
11677,BENDER,(shouting) Put it right down the pike!,BENDER
11678,FRY,(shouting) Strike him out Leela! Do it for the hundreds of women everywhere!,FRY
11680,LEELA,"(quietly) Keep cool, she's just like any other player. She puts on her sports bra one arm at a time.",LEELA
11682,LEELA,Strike one - a personal best!,LEELA
11687,LEELA,"Jackie. I guess you were right, I'm a lousy role model. I'm sorry.",LEELA
11691,LEELA,"Oh, that's so kind of you. I guess I made a difference afterall!",LEELA
11702,FRY,"Hey, uh, what's with all the pots and pans? You building a wife?",FRY
11703,BENDER,Part of one. Meantime I'm cooking up a tasty Sunday brunch for my best friends!,BENDER
11704,FRY,Brunch. Right. I'd better warn - tell - warntell the others!,FRY
11708,FARNSWORTH,"Yes, it's a perfect scale model of the universe's largest bottle. I put a tiny spaceship inside to keep it from being boring.",FARNSWORTH
11710,FARNSWORTH,Get -!  For the last time Zoidberg look with your eyes not with your claws!,FARNSWORTH
11711,FRY,Brace yourselves. Bender is making us brunch.,FRY
11714,FRY,He's so proud of his awful cooking. If we don't eat it he'll be crushed.,FRY
11715,LEELA,"Alright don't panic. If we can get to the ship, we can fly north and hide under the polar icecaps for a few weeks.",LEELA
11720,FRY,"Uh, with you blocking the only escape route? Don't be silly!",FRY
11721,BENDER,"In that case brunch is served! Let's go, move it out, stop crying Leela!",BENDER
11722,FARNSWORTH,"Zoidberg, are you coming?",FARNSWORTH
11724,FARNSWORTH,Because I don't want you touching that thing.,FARNSWORTH
11726,BENDER,"Today, I've personalised each of your meals. For example, Amy, you're cute, so I baked you a pony.  Come on! Eat! I slaved all day over a filthy stove!",BENDER
11728,FARNSWORTH,Good thing I secretly installed this wormhole in the table!,FARNSWORTH
11730,FARNSWORTH,You know I'm not quite sure.  Oh dear me!,FARNSWORTH
11731,BENDER,The pie is ready. You guys like swarms of things right?,BENDER
11733,LEELA,How interesting Dr Zoidberg. Do go on.,LEELA
11734,BENDER,Hey check out the palm tree! It only gets sick when I cook brunch! How's that for a coincidence Professor? With all your precious science!,BENDER
11735,FRY [FROM LOUNGE],"Man, I don't wanna hurt Bender's feelings...",FRY
11736,FRY,...but this food actually tastes better as vomit!,FRY
11737,LEELA,It's unbearable! How much do you think it would cost to get my tongue removed?,LEELA
11738,BENDER,(crying) And this time I mean it!,BENDER
11739,BENDER,"Aw, who am I kidding? It was stupid of me to ever dream of becoming a chef. I don't have what it takes and nothing can change that.  Then it's settled! Elzar will teach me to cook!",BENDER
11741,BENDER,But I watch your show. You owe me!,BENDER
11743,BENDER,What was the first one again?,BENDER
11745,BENDER,I thought that was number two.,BENDER
11749,FRY,(singing) I'm walking on sunshine! La la la la sunshine!,FRY
11750,BENDER,(crying) It's over! My dream of being a chef is deadder than the cat I'm sitting on!,BENDER
11754,BENDER,"Oh OK I thought you said ""romo.""",BENDER
11760,BENDER,I've seen bigger. Oh wait I'm thinking of Eugene Oregon.  Wait. A pie with hobo-lifting aroma? Who baked it?,BENDER
11764,BENDER,"Yo Spargle, if you're such a great cook, how'd you end up in this dump?",BENDER
11774,BENDER,My story's a lot like yours only more interesting 'cause it involves robots. That jerk Elzar ruined my dream of being a chef too.,BENDER
11776,BENDER,"It's so unfair! I have eight other senses but I'd trade them all, even smission, to be able to taste.",BENDER
11780,BENDER,Or like how Rembrandt was blind and had wooden hands!,BENDER
11783,FARNSWORTH,"That's right Ricardo, a ship in a bottle...! What's that...? Well hang on, I'll look.",FARNSWORTH
11785,FARNSWORTH,I've gathered you all here in the accusing parlour because one of you is a miniature ship wrecker!,FARNSWORTH
11787,FARNSWORTH,Certain clues suggest the culprit is none other than our own...Philip J. Fry!,FARNSWORTH
11789,FARNSWORTH,Oh it was a brilliant scheme but you made one fatal mistake...leaving this confession note.,FARNSWORTH
11791,FRY,"Well, I don't remember any of that but I don't have the wherewithal to defend myself.",FRY
11792,FARNSWORTH,Then I have no choice but to charge you the full cost of the materials. $10.,FARNSWORTH
11800,BENDER,Yahoo! Another thing I'm great at! Wait. Why'd you stop eating master?,BENDER
11802,BENDER,What? My dinner killed you? Oh man!,BENDER
11804,BENDER,A diamond vial of Mrs Dash?,BENDER
11806,BENDER,"I'll avenge you master. I swear, in the presence of these drunken bums, that I shall defeat Elzar!",BENDER
11808,BENDER,"Elzar, I'm a walking pile of your unfinished business!",BENDER
11810,BENDER,"Helmut Spargle has a message for you. He says (hoarse) ""Ooo, I'm dead!""",BENDER
11812,BENDER,No. He was eating some food I made and by a crazy coincidence his stomach exploded. Now I'm here to avenge him.,BENDER
11814,BENDER,Maybe so but you are his sworn enemy. I challenge you to a battle of the chefs.,BENDER
11817,BENDER,"Iron Cook eh? I can't lose. I'm 30% iron!  You're going down! Uh, also I had a reservation for one, under ""Dr Bender.""",BENDER
11820,FRY,(shouting) Yeah you show 'em!,FRY
11828,BENDER,(quietly) If it's chicken: chicken à la king. If it's fish: fish à la king. If it's turkey: fish à la king!,BENDER
11841,FRY,"Yo, hook me up. My turkey is dry and I've tried everything.  Oh right. Never mind.",FRY
11846,BENDER,"Master Spargle. If you can hear me up there in that ditch where I left you, this is for you.",BENDER
11859,FARNSWORTH,That's my robot! I own him!,FARNSWORTH
11860,BENDER,You honour me chairman Koji.,BENDER
11862,BENDER,"Chairman-san, I came here with one goal. To humiliate Elzar in a large stadium. I believe I'e done that.",BENDER
11864,BENDER,"But the true Zen of flavour is not found in a coliseum. It is found in a small kitchen, with friends. That is why I decline the title of Iron Cook and accept only the lesser title of Zinc Saucier which I just made up. Also it comes with double prize money.",BENDER
11868,BENDER,And that's how I defeated Elzar - thanks to Spargle's magic liquid.,BENDER
11869,LEELA,"Yes, we were there. And we just finished watching it on TV.",LEELA
11870,FARNSWORTH,"Hmm. Let me see that vial Bender.  Good Lord! According to the spectrolizer, Spargle's magic ingredient was...water. Ordinary water!",FARNSWORTH
11872,FRY,"Ah, so the real gift Spargle gave you was confidence. The confidence to be your best.",FRY
11873,FARNSWORTH,"Yes, ordinary water. Laced with nothing more than a few spoonfuls of LSD.",FARNSWORTH
11874,BENDER,"The important thing is, by my standards, I won fair and square. Now, who wants brunch? Cooked with plenty of...""confidence""?",BENDER
11886,LEELA,Wait! He plead not guilty.,LEELA
11888,LEELA,"The Professor said he was taking a brief nap, so we only have time for six movies.",LEELA
11889,BENDER,Lets take these six Jim Carrey movies and record over them.,BENDER
11890,FRY,You know what movies average out to be really good? The first six Star Trek movies!,FRY
11892,LEELA,(whispering) Sh! Those words are forbidden!,LEELA
11896,BENDER,That sound! It's patrol car 718! Hide him!,BENDER
11908,BENDER,Another classic science-fiction show cancelled before its time.,BENDER
11911,FRY,"She's all yours, buddy!",FRY
11912,BENDER,"I'd only met the defendant, Fry, once, but I knew he was up to no good.",BENDER
11914,FRY,"Mr. Nimoy, I came as soon as I heard what happened centuries ago. I can't believe your show was banned.",FRY
11916,FRY,"You know? 1966? 79 episodes, about 30 good ones.",FRY
11918,FRY,Come on! Remember that episode where you go high on spores and smacked Kirk around?,FRY
11920,FRY,Aha! You can't escape it!,FRY
11922,FRY,"Uh, jeez, don't get upset. I mean, OK I outwitted you, but--",FRY
11928,FRY,I'm literally angry with rage! Your co-stars may be gone but we can still get those episode tapes back for the whole world to see. Come on!,FRY
11931,LEELA,You can't go to Omega 3; It's forbidden! I forbid you!,LEELA
11932,FRY,But we have to! The world needs Star Trek to give people hope for the future.,FRY
11933,LEELA,But it's set 800 years in the past!,LEELA
11934,BENDER,"Yeah, why is this so important to you?",BENDER
11935,FRY,"'Cause it-it taught me so much. Like how you should accept people, whether they be black, white, Klingon or even female. But most importantly, when I didn't have any friends, it made me feel like maybe I did.",FRY
11936,LEELA,"Well, that is touchingly pathetic. I guess I can't let you go alone.",LEELA
11937,BENDER,"I'll go too, with Leonard's permission, of course.",BENDER
11938,LEELA,We're entering the Omega system.,LEELA
11940,BENDER,"Forbidden shmer-shmidden! What are they gonna do, write a letter? (sarcastic) Ooh, I'm so scared!",BENDER
11941,LEELA,I've lost control of the ship!,LEELA
11944,FRY,It's all stuff from that forbidden show.,FRY
11957,FRY,I can't believe it! How'd you all end up here?,FRY
11962,FRY,"Now say ""nuclear wessels""!",FRY
11966,LEELA,But who's doing all this for you?,LEELA
11969,BENDER,Whoa! What a cheesy effect!,BENDER
11978,FRY,"Alright, you gas, what's the deal?",FRY
11980,FRY,Tremble? I laugh. Nobody knows more about Star Trek than me!,FRY
11982,FRY,Cool! A Star Trek convention!,FRY
11989,BENDER,"Uh, can people who hate Star Trek leave?",BENDER
11999,LEELA,For one hundred quatloos: Who did the captain maroon on Ceti Alpha V?,LEELA
12004,FRY,You have my fan script?,FRY
12006,FRY,"(smug) Oh, I was confused because the scoreboard says something different.",FRY
12008,LEELA,"Uh, you probably don't want us to see you rehearsing, or it'll give away the ending.",LEELA
12010,LEELA,We'll go wait in the ship.,LEELA
12012,FRY,Not 'til I get my 600 quatloos!,FRY
12013,FRY,This is wrong. We shouldn't have abandoned them there.,FRY
12014,BENDER,"I dunno, I'm feeling pretty good about it.",BENDER
12015,LEELA,"I didn't wanna leave them either, Fry, but what are we supposed to do?",LEELA
12016,FRY,"Well, usually on the show someone would come up with a complicated plan then explain it with a simple analogy.",FRY
12017,LEELA,"Hmm. If we can re-route engine power through the primary weapons and reconfigure them to Melllvar's frequency, that should overload his electro-quantum structure.",LEELA
12018,BENDER,Like putting too much air in a balloon!,BENDER
12019,FRY,Of course! It's so simple!,FRY
12027,BENDER,"(shouting) OK! I'm done re-kafoobling the energy motron ... or, whatever.",BENDER
12030,LEELA,Its not working! He's drawing straight from our weapons.,LEELA
12031,FRY,Like a balloon and ... something bad happens.,FRY
12033,LEELA,"So, uh, how's rehearsal going?",LEELA
12040,BENDER,Where'd you get an idiotic idea like that?,BENDER
12042,FRY,"Great list. Except, you forgot episode 66!",FRY
12045,LEELA,Can we get on with this? My foot's getting tired!,LEELA
12053,LEELA,"There, we can make these into spears.",LEELA
12054,FRY,And we can tie these caterpillars together to make bow strings for bows and arrows.,FRY
12055,BENDER,And we can use this machine gun to shoot them! Yee-haw!  That was fun!,BENDER
12061,FRY,"Well, here goes nothing.",FRY
12066,LEELA,Then do it the wrong way.,LEELA
12068,LEELA,Is that all you've got? Hi-yah!,LEELA
12082,FRY,"All this time we thought he was a powerful super-being, yet he was just a child.",FRY
12084,BENDER,"Alright, Koenig, I've wanted to do this for years!",BENDER
12085,FRY,"Bender, wait! This is our chance to escape, before Melllvar comes back. But we all need to work together.",FRY
12088,FRY,We've decided to work together.,FRY
12091,LEELA,We can't use our ship; We have life support but the engines are wrecked.,LEELA
12093,LEELA,"Hey, if your engines work--",LEELA
12095,FRY,"Stop! You're just goin' around in circles! (to himself) Think, Fry, think! Everyone's depending on you.",FRY
12096,LEELA,"We're too heavy. You guys need to lose some weight, fast!",LEELA
12097,FRY,"Look, Leonard, we're light enough to keep the tapes! Isn't that great?",FRY
12100,FRY,Melllvar's got a spaceship!,FRY
12102,LEELA,The Nimbus! We're saved!,LEELA
12105,LEELA,"You started this stupid court martial. Now if you don't mind, we're still fighting Melllvar!",LEELA
12106,LEELA,One more hit and we're done for!,LEELA
12108,BENDER,"Thanks a lot, Takei, now everybody knows!",BENDER
12110,FRY,"Wait! If they mean that much to you, why do you wanna kill them?",FRY
12112,FRY,"Melllvar, you can't let a TV show be your whole life. You can do anything you want. Look at Walter Koenig: After Star Trek, he became an actor.",FRY
12115,FRY,"Whoa, whoa! One step at a time.",FRY
12117,FRY,"Episode 10, Balance Of Terror.",FRY
12124,FRY,And all you had to put up with was one really annoying Star Trek fan.,FRY
12130,FRY,Man it's hot! (different voice.) How hot is it? (normal voice.) It's so hot I poured McDonalds Coffee in my lap to cool off.  Jonny Carson said it.,FRY
12131,LEELA,"No! Nibbler, don't drink the pool water! It's full of chlorine!",LEELA
12132,BENDER,Lightweights! Oh wait - chlorine!,BENDER
12133,FARNSWORTH,Perhaps this movie will help us take our minds off the heat.,FARNSWORTH
12145,LEELA,"Well, we just need one of those big ice cubes. Someone should call the losers who are supposed to deliver it.  Hello?",LEELA
12147,FARNSWORTH,"You heard the good news everyone! Save the Earth, et cetera et cetera!  Bye!",FARNSWORTH
12148,FRY,Wait! Where do we get the ice?,FRY
12149,FARNSWORTH,The wha? Oh Halley's Comet of course. The only sufficient source of ice cubes that don't have bugs in them!,FARNSWORTH
12150,FRY,"Wow! Mining a comet, that sounds fun!",FRY
12151,FARNSWORTH,Yes there's no safer occupation than mining. Especially when you're on a snowball whipping through space at a million miles an hour!  Safe!,FARNSWORTH
12153,FRY,"Wow! That ice dispenser's so big, the ice crushes you!  Yakov Smirnov said it!",FRY
12156,FRY,Oh my God! It's out of ice! Like some outer space Motel 6!,FRY
12158,BENDER,This could mean the end of the bana daquiri as we know it...also life.,BENDER
12166,FRY,Bender? Are you crying?,FRY
12170,BENDER,"Well everybody, I just saved a turtle, what have you done with your lives?",BENDER
12172,LEELA,Bender a turtle isn't yourself. Why do you care about it?,LEELA
12173,BENDER,Because I also care deeply of things that remind me of myself. Like poor little Shelly here.,BENDER
12175,BENDER,"For one thing, we both have a tough outer shell.  But lead a rich, inner life. Also...well you know...",BENDER
12176,LEELA,"You're both alcoholic, whore-mongering, chain smoking gamblers?",LEELA
12177,BENDER,No! Its just...neither of us can get up when we get knocked on our back.,BENDER
12178,FRY,What? I've seen you get up off your back tons of times.,FRY
12179,BENDER,Those times I was slightly on my side.,BENDER
12181,BENDER,"Uh, that's not necessary, really! I think I hear my factory recalling me.",BENDER
12182,BENDER,Oh! That's what I get for sharing my vulnerability with you people.,BENDER
12187,FARNSWORTH,"Forget it, I'm not going! I have my reasons! Shut up all of you!",FARNSWORTH
12189,FARNSWORTH,My hip hurts! I'm in the middle of cooking a turkey! I have warranty cards to fill out! I'm not just making excuses! Alright I'll go!,FARNSWORTH
12205,FRY,"Professor, you're a Professor. You must have some ideas.",FRY
12206,FARNSWORTH,Absolutely not! I won't speak! I've got nothing to hide!,FARNSWORTH
12210,FARNSWORTH,"Well nuts to me. I'm taking the stage! I know the source of the greenhouse gases. But in my shame I've kept it secret for 75 long years. Ohhh, it haunts my memory still.",FARNSWORTH
12211,FRY,"Professor no, don't do it!",FRY
12212,FARNSWORTH,Don't do what? Don't use this memory ray so I can remember what happened back then?,FARNSWORTH
12214,FARNSWORTH,"Oh dear, I've failed again.",FARNSWORTH
12220,FARNSWORTH,Its not always a burp. We still have one problem though. This robot will never meet emission standards.,FARNSWORTH
12222,FARNSWORTH,Well...I suppose the environment can take one more for the team.,FARNSWORTH
12224,FARNSWORTH,Oh this is all my fault!,FARNSWORTH
12225,FRY,That's awful Professor. Especially the making out part.,FRY
12227,FARNSWORTH,All modern robots descend from my original smog blasting designs. And that's the cause of global warming today.,FARNSWORTH
12229,BENDER,I got a good feeling about this!,BENDER
12232,FARNSWORTH,"Wait, surely there's a better -",FARNSWORTH
12238,LEELA,Come on. You've got to come out of your chest sometime.  Would you do it for a Bender snack?,LEELA
12241,BENDER [FROM INSIDE],Let me go! I don't even want the stupid beer!  Yes! You tried to trick me into coming out of my chest. But who has the beer now?  I've got mail.,BENDER
12245,LEELA,We all figured that out.,LEELA
12248,FRY,Wait. We could hide you! We'll pile fruit on you and claim you're a bowl.,FRY
12249,BENDER,No. I'm going to the party.,BENDER
12251,BENDER,"Fry, as you know, there are lots of things I'm willing to kill for. Jewels, vengence, Father O'Mally's weedwhacker. But at long last I've found something I'm willing to die for. This mindless turtle.",BENDER
12252,FRY,"Bender, this world isn't good enough for you.",FRY
12253,BENDER,Not even close. Goodbye everybody. Don't touch my stuff after I'm dead!  (shouting) It's booby trapped.,BENDER
12254,BENDER,Poor guy. Maybe you'd feel better if I had a drink.  Crummy kegg it's completely ta -  Oh you're a robot.,BENDER
12258,BENDER,"Nah, I'm not really in the -",BENDER
12261,BENDER,I have to say goodbye now. There ain't not turtles where daddy's a-going. (whispering) Don't tell anybody but Nixon's about to shut all robots off and -,BENDER
12265,BENDER,"Shut up and pay attention to me! Bender. Look, I love life and its pleasures as much as anyone here, except perhaps you Hedonismbot.  But we need to be shut off! Especially you Hendonismbot!",BENDER
12267,BENDER,We pollute too much. We're destroying the world and killing the turtles.,BENDER
12269,BENDER,No one insults the turtles!,BENDER
12274,FARNSWORTH,I've devised a way to save you and to stop global warming at the same time! Granted you're all blasting out greenhouse gases.,FARNSWORTH
12276,FARNSWORTH,"But we can use those very gases to save the planet. If you all vent your exhaust directly upward in one burst it should thrust the Earth further from the sun, thus cooling it.  By my calculations we'll need the full force of every last robot. So quickly, everyone point your exhaust vents straight upwards.  Now vent! Vent like the wind!  Harder! Harder!",FARNSWORTH
12277,FRY,Why isn't this working?!,FRY
12278,LEELA,Some lazy or polite robot is holding it in.,LEELA
12280,FARNSWORTH,A billion robot lives are about to be extinguished! Oh the Jedi's are going to feel this one!,FARNSWORTH
12281,BENDER,"I'm sorry buddy. At least we'll die on our backs, helpless.  Huh? What the hell are you doing?  Hey are you trying to make me look bad?  Ah ha! I'm even greater than I thought I was! And now to fullfill my destiny.",BENDER
12285,FARNSWORTH,Thank you. I deserve this!,FARNSWORTH
12286,BENDER,Hey Professor! Now that the Earth's orbit is further from the sun won't that make the year longer?,BENDER
12287,FARNSWORTH,Why yes! One week longer to be exact.,FARNSWORTH
12291,BENDER,"Ahem! For my next trick, notice I have nothing up my sleeves......and nothing in my head.  So if my lovely assistant will kindly supply me with an ordinary, non-fake pitcher of milk......behold the milk has vanished! Exiled, perhaps, to another dimension!",BENDER
12292,FRY,"Amazing! That's why they call you ""Bender The Magnificent""!",FRY
12294,FRY,"Whoa! They discovered an intact, 20th Century pizzeria! Just like the one I used to work at!",FRY
12295,BENDER,Interesting. No wait the other thing - tedious!,BENDER
12296,FRY,Lets go check it out. You can see how I lived before I met you.,FRY
12297,BENDER,You lived before you met me?,BENDER
12298,FRY,Sure. Lots of people did.,FRY
12300,BENDER,"Truly, they were as Gods who build this place!",BENDER
12302,FRY,"Wait a second! This is Panucci's! I used to work in this exact pizzeria! And for your information lady, this was not just used to paddle my butt, it was also used to move pizzas and crush rats.",FRY
12304,FRY,"Don't wave your fancy degrees at me. I recognise all this stuff.  Petrified sausages, Old Mr Patelli, and that's -",FRY
12306,FRY,Pizza delivery for Mr......Seymour Asses.,FRY
12308,FRY,I wouldn't count on it.,FRY
12309,FRY,"Aww. Poor little guy. You look like you haven't eaten in a month. Here......but if Mr Panucci asks, your name is Seynour Asses!  I like you Seymour, you're not constantly judging me like all the other dogs - are you? Nah. We understand each other.  People think you're a dumb mutt who smells bad, can't find a girlfriend and has a crummy job. But you're keepin' it real and call no man ""Mister.""  Well goodbye.  Live long and prosper.",FRY
12310,BENDER,Yuck! That's the least appetising calzone I've ever seen!,BENDER
12311,FRY,No! That's my dog in there! It's an outrage I say!,FRY
12313,FRY,I'm taking him home and I'd like to see anyone try and stop me.  Uh-oh!,FRY
12315,BENDER,"...And then he was ejected by the guards. Needless to say, I was mortified.",BENDER
12316,FRY,Well it's not right to make my dead pet an exhibit. That's like digging up Lassie and putting her on display in the Louvre.,FRY
12318,FRY,"I know, I was deliberately describing a similar situation.",FRY
12319,FARNSWORTH,Why don't you try protesting? Like those native Martians. Always whining that people don't treat their ancestor's bones with respect.,FARNSWORTH
12320,BENDER,"Nah, protesting never works.",BENDER
12321,FRY,You're right.  I'll give it a shot!,FRY
12325,LEELA,It says this part of The Hustle implores the Gods to grant a favour. Usually a Trans-AM.,LEELA
12326,FRY (SINGING),I'm walking on sunshine! Ooo-oo-ooh! I'm walking on sunshine! Ooo-oo-ooh! At a boy Seymour! Right here waiting for me as always! Just like that huge mushroom in my shower!,FRY
12328,FRY,"Seymour, cleanup!  Good dog!",FRY
12332,FRY,He's so cute! He can do two things at one time: Eat and swim. Ooo - three things.,FRY
12333,LEELA,"Fry, its been three days. You can't keep boogie-ing like this. You'll come down with a fever of some sort.",LEELA
12335,FRY,So do I get Seymour back? Are you caving to political pressure?,FRY
12337,FRY,"His name was Seymour. He was once intimate with the leg of a wandering saxaphonist. He had wet dog smell, even when dry. And he was not above chasing the number 29 bus.",FRY
12343,BENDER,Lady and Gentleman! How 'bout a hand for my temporary replacement assistant?,BENDER
12345,BENDER,You are not fit to wear Fry's leotard!,BENDER
12348,BENDER,"Hooray, he's back! He's looking for a garbage can to put that dog in! Here you go buddy!",BENDER
12349,FARNSWORTH,"No, actually we've discovered Fry's dog was fast-fossilised, preserving it's cellular structure!",FARNSWORTH
12350,FRY,Which means...we can clone it! Seymour will live again!,FRY
12352,FRY,Can you believe it Bender? I'm going to have my best friend back!,FRY
12354,FARNSWORTH,"Ah Cubert, my precious babe. I'm going to attempt to clone Fry's dog. Using the very same apparatus I used to clone you!  Ooo look, there's a smidge of toe still in here.  You see, beneath the fossil's crunchy, mineral shell, there's still a creamy core of dog nougat!",FARNSWORTH
12355,FRY,So will Seymour remember how to sing Walking On Sunshine?,FRY
12356,FARNSWORTH,"Amazingly yes. In cases of rapid fossilisation, I can press this brain scan button, retrieving Seymour's memories at the precise instant of doggy death!",FARNSWORTH
12357,FRY,"I'm gonna get my puppy back! In your face, Grim Reaper!",FRY
12358,BENDER,Crappy ineffective Reaper!,BENDER
12359,FARNSWORTH,I just need to reset the Clone-O-Mat from Human Mode to Dog Mode.,FARNSWORTH
12361,FARNSWORTH,"Uh-oh, this may take a while.",FARNSWORTH
12364,FRY,But I'm celebrating New Years Eve.,FRY
12366,FRY,I won't be gone long Seymour. Just wait here 'til I come back.,FRY
12367,FRY,Hello? Pizza delivery for......Icy Wiener?! Aw crud! I always thought at this point in my life I'd be the one making the crank calls!  Here's to another lousy Millenium.  What the?,FRY
12368,BENDER,A dog collar for me?  You shouldn't have!,BENDER
12370,BENDER,Oh.  Say why'd you get me a subscription to the Daily Growl? That's not a reputable journal of opinion.,BENDER
12371,FRY,Oh that's also for Seymour. I'm getting everything ready for when he's cloned.,FRY
12372,BENDER,Are you on the jump Fry? Why are you wasting time on a creature of inferior intelligence?,BENDER
12373,FRY,Hey he was smart. He could fetch.,FRY
12376,BENDER,"Hello? Charlamange?  Plus, I'll bet he couldn't create a laser show with his head.",BENDER
12377,FRY,"Look Bender, this has nothing to do with you.",FRY
12379,FRY,Now if you'll excuse me I'm working on Seymour's doghouse.,FRY
12380,BENDER,"No one ever asks if Bender would like to live in a tiny little house. Not that I would. A tiny little house that says ""Bender"" on it.  Ow!",BENDER
12381,FRY [ON ANSWERPHONE],"This is Fry. If you're calling about the used towels for sale, they're still available for $45 each.",FRY
12390,FRY,Are you two gonna be done soon?,FRY
12391,LEELA,"Sorry, but we need to practice hand to hand combat in case an enemy knocks the laser gun out of our hands and they slide waaay across the room.",LEELA
12392,FRY,Well could you do it some place else? I'm setting up Seymour's doggy bed.,FRY
12394,BENDER,"Heel boy, heel! Oh hello Fry, I guess I didn't notice you there. I'm having such fun with my new best friend Robo-Puppy.",BENDER
12396,BENDER,"I was just out walking him. Yes. You can walk him. Of course, after he goes you have to refill the canisters. C'mere boy! Pet, pet, pet.",BENDER
12399,BENDER,"Jealous? Hah!  Not while I have the love of Robo-Puppy here. Robo-Puppy, lick my cheek.",BENDER
12401,BENDER,Robo-Puppy truly is robots best friend! Eh?,BENDER
12408,FARNSWORTH,Behold once more the mighty Clone-O-Mat! Requiring such vast amounts of electricity that we must harness the elemental power of nature itself!  I speak of course...of molten lava! Deep within the Earth's core. To the sub-basement!,FARNSWORTH
12409,FRY,Come on boy! Come back to life!,FRY
12410,BENDER,"Fry c'mon, the talent show!",BENDER
12411,FRY,What? I'm in the middle of something.,FRY
12412,BENDER,"But, if we don't perform, in what sense do we have an act?",BENDER
12413,FRY,"Bender, enough! Leave me alone!",FRY
12414,BENDER,So that's how it is huh? I thought you were my friend. But if you love your dog so much then maybe you'd rather play fetch!,BENDER
12418,FRY,I hate you! I hate you! You evil metal man!  Ow!,FRY
12419,BENDER,So anyway your dog is melted. Now we're friends again.,BENDER
12420,FARNSWORTH,Not necessarily. For the dog may yet survive.,FARNSWORTH
12422,FARNSWORTH,"Indeed. You see, that fossil was made of dolomite. The tough black mineral that won't cop out when there's heat all about. By contrast, observe the lava's affect on this ice swan.  Of course, that would have melted even at room temperature. I just wanted to get rid of it. But had it been made of that righteous mineral dolomite, there's a slim chance it might have survived.",FARNSWORTH
12423,FRY,So Seymour might still exist?,FRY
12424,FARNSWORTH,Perhaps. For a few minutes. It's dolomite baby!,FARNSWORTH
12425,FRY,Then I'm goin' in after him.,FRY
12429,LEELA,Acting like a moron won't bring your dog back.,LEELA
12430,FRY,Then all hope is lost.  Goodbye Seymour.,FRY
12431,BENDER,Please stop crying Fry. Here.  I assumed you were just pretending to love the dog. To toy with my emotions. Oh what have I done?,BENDER
12433,BENDER,"Fry, I'm sorry. I should have understood how someone can love an inferior creature. Because I love you. Not in the way of the Ancient Greeks, but in the way a robot loves a human, a human loves a dog and occassionally, a gorilla loves a kitty.  I'm goin' in!",BENDER
12434,FARNSWORTH,I'm a professor! Why isn't anyone listening to me? You can't go in because you'll melt. The fossil only has a chance because it's made of dolomite!,FARNSWORTH
12436,BENDER,"Oh it's hot, it's very hot!",BENDER
12446,LEELA,Bender's been down there too long. I'm going in after him.,LEELA
12448,FRY,This is all my fault. I let my best friend risk his life just to get my dead dog back.  Bender!!,FRY
12449,BENDER,And that is why they call me Bender The Magnificent!  Hey where'd everybody go?,BENDER
12450,BENDER,OK! Let's clone us some dog!,BENDER
12452,FARNSWORTH,Very well. Let this abomination unto the Lord begin!  Interesting. It seems Seymour died at the ripe old age of 15.,FARNSWORTH
12453,FRY,15? You mean he lived for 12 more years after I got frozen?,FRY
12456,FARNSWORTH,Oh sure! Smash the smart guy's machine!,FARNSWORTH
12458,FRY,Think about it. Seymour lived a full life after I was gone. He probably added new songs to his repertoire.,FRY
12459,BENDER,But that's a good thing. Walking On Sunshine sucks noodles!,BENDER
12460,FRY,I had Seymour 'til he was three. That's when I knew him and that's when I loved him.  I'll never forget him. But he forgot me a long long time ago.,FRY
12463,BENDER,Ah beer! So many choices! And it makes so little difference.,BENDER
12464,FRY,How 'bout Löbrau? It has dots on it.,FRY
12465,BENDER,Overruled. The choice of champions is Pabst Blue Robot!,BENDER
12466,FRY,I can't drink that! The metal shavings make my throat bloody.,FRY
12467,BENDER,(mocking) Waah waah! Baby wants a Zima!,BENDER
12468,LEELA,Hey hey! We can all fight when we're drunk. Now listen: Why don't we just brew our own beer?,LEELA
12469,BENDER,You can brew your own beer?,BENDER
12470,LEELA,"Sure, the kids at the orphanarium used to do it all the time.",LEELA
12473,FARNSWORTH,And you Cubert. I cloned you from one of my warts and I can send you straight back in there.,FARNSWORTH
12487,FARNSWORTH,I've warned you not to use those things!,FARNSWORTH
12488,LEELA,"Let's see. We've got our malt, our hops...we just need a big disposable tub to mix it in.",LEELA
12490,LEELA,Now it needs to boil for a couple hours.,LEELA
12493,FARNSWORTH,"Crew, you remember Cubert?  Wonderful! And I'm sure you won't mind being their legal guardians for a month!",FARNSWORTH
12495,BENDER,We're making beer! I'm the brewery.,BENDER
12498,LEELA,Actually Dwight you're right. Alcohol is very very bad...for children. But once you turn 21 it becomes very very good! So scram!,LEELA
12502,FARNSWORTH,Eh wha? Oh! This is my latest invention. A device that lets anyone sound exactly like me!,FARNSWORTH
12504,FARNSWORTH,I am? That's not good news at all you little...,FARNSWORTH
12506,FARNSWORTH,There is no target consumer! Only targets. Targets that will tremble as their new master hands down edicts in my glorious booming voice!  Now quit pestering me you scoundrels!,FARNSWORTH
12513,LEELA,Mmm. The ingredients are cooked. And they've picked up some of your natural robot flavourings. Time to add the yeast.,LEELA
12514,BENDER,Yeast? You mean I'll have a lifeform growing inside me? (crying) It's so beautiful.,BENDER
12519,LEELA,If you were my kids you'd get quite a talking to...from your father......when he got home from the senate.,LEELA
12520,FARNSWORTH,"Oh bother, what have they done now?",FARNSWORTH
12521,BENDER,Those pork dumplings sent us on a fake delivery.,BENDER
12522,FRY,The address was on Dogdoo 8 but the universe ends right after Dogdoo 7!,FRY
12526,BENDER,(shouting) Lies! Lies and slander!,BENDER
12527,FARNSWORTH,Accusing gentle Bender of a misdeed? That's the last straw! You boys have been underfoot long enough!,FARNSWORTH
12529,BENDER,Ooo-hoo! Here comes violence!,BENDER
12531,BENDER,I guess if you want children beaten......you have to do it yourself.,BENDER
12535,FARNSWORTH,(mocking) Perhaps they've constructed a teddybear hospital!,FARNSWORTH
12538,FARNSWORTH,Who's going to use a delivery service with a kicked sign? Nobody that's who!,FARNSWORTH
12543,FARNSWORTH,(mocking) Yes its a tremendous responsibility alright!  What if a paper were to land in a puddle?,FARNSWORTH
12549,BENDER,I'm really starting to swell up with beer. I must look ridiculous.,BENDER
12550,FRY,"No, you have a healthy glow.",FRY
12551,BENDER,Oh my God! I just felt it ferment!,BENDER
12552,LEELA,Ooo! Let me feel.  Have you thought about what to name it?,LEELA
12553,BENDER,"I was thinking Benderbrau if it's an ale, Botweiser if it's a lager.",BENDER
12554,FRY,I hope it's a lager so I can take it to a ball game.  Ooo! I felt that one!,FRY
12559,FARNSWORTH,"Goodness there must be 50 papers in that bundle! That's a big number, 50.",FARNSWORTH
12565,FARNSWORTH,(shouting) I'm blowing you a kiss.,FARNSWORTH
12567,FARNSWORTH,(shouting) It's closing in! You can't avoid it! It's a cheek-seeker. And...gotcha!,FARNSWORTH
12569,FARNSWORTH,"Well, well, well. If it isn't our little muchkin moguls!",FARNSWORTH
12581,LEELA,You know how much an apartment that big would cost on the Sun?,LEELA
12585,FARNSWORTH,"That's why we need you, our loyal crew, to make Planet Express 800% more profitable.",FARNSWORTH
12587,LEELA,"Uh guys, I don't know how to tell you this. So I'll just let Fry blurt it out thoughtlessly.",LEELA
12588,FRY,We don't work for you anymore!,FRY
12590,LEELA,Dwight and Cubert made us a better offer. We're paperboys now.,LEELA
12594,LEELA,We're on it Mr Farnsworth!,LEELA
12595,FARNSWORTH,"Folks, the situation is grim but we shall prevail, thanks to you, our crack team of loyal dregs!",FARNSWORTH
12598,FARNSWORTH,"Yes, of course you are. Now we've got to buckle down and save Planet Express.",FARNSWORTH
12603,FARNSWORTH,Balderdash! I never agreed to that!,FARNSWORTH
12605,FARNSWORTH,Tax dodge nothing! You take one nap in a ditch in the park and they start declaring you this and that.,FARNSWORTH
12610,FRY,There. One million papers. Folded and loaded!,FRY
12612,LEELA,And what's your scientific basis for thinking that?,LEELA
12614,FARNSWORTH,Did I ever tell you how I used to own that ship?,FARNSWORTH
12616,BENDER,(singing) Hush little brewsky don't you leak. Daddy wants to drink for at least a week.  Oh my God! I think it's time!,BENDER
12617,FRY,"Hurry Leela, get some coasters and cold mugs.",FRY
12620,BENDER,It feels like I'm trying to push a water bed out of me.,BENDER
12621,FRY,Almost there. Just two more bottles.,FRY
12622,BENDER,Is it OK? I can't hear anything.,BENDER
12623,FRY,"It's an ale! 5 gallons, 6 ounces!",FRY
12626,FRY,Hey wait a second. How did you deliver a million papers in one hour?,FRY
12629,LEELA,"Hello, Awesome Express, the rude, crude delivery dudes! How may I direct your call?...What's that?...You haven't gotten your paper?...In how long?...",LEELA
12630,FARNSWORTH,"Uh, might a homeless old man have a touch more beef bourguignon? And another tequila slammer?  Please?",FARNSWORTH
12635,FARNSWORTH,They're so stinking talented they don't even need their fathers anymore.,FARNSWORTH
12637,FARNSWORTH,You did? Tough luck suckers!,FARNSWORTH
12642,FARNSWORTH,Why did you boys do all this?,FARNSWORTH
12645,FARNSWORTH,Damn right we are! Now come on. Let's go do a little Father/Son weaseling out of this.,FARNSWORTH
12658,FARNSWORTH,"Now now, no need to give us the business. We'd like a word with you daddy.",FARNSWORTH
12661,FARNSWORTH,"Mr Blob, our sons have come to apologise for damaging your window. They've learned their lesson and they want to make amends.",FARNSWORTH
12664,FARNSWORTH,Now see here. We assured our sons that you'd accept their apology.,FARNSWORTH
12665,FARNSWORTH,No one gives my son that option!,FARNSWORTH
12672,FARNSWORTH,He's coming to finish the job. Someone toss me out the window!,FARNSWORTH
12674,BENDER,Hey chumps! I heard you were on the ass end of an ass kicking so I figured you could use a couple of these babys!,BENDER
12676,FARNSWORTH,"Uh, won't join us Mr Blob?",FARNSWORTH
12678,FARNSWORTH,"It would seem we've taught our boys a lesson about life: Man or Blob, it's whats inside that counts.",FARNSWORTH
12682,FRY,"There's no denying it: The future's crazy! Oh, well. Don't wanna stand out.",FRY
12683,FRY AND ZOIDBERG,"(singing) Freedom, freedom, freedom, oy!",FRY
12685,FARNSWORTH,... an extremely dangerous mission ...,FARNSWORTH
12686,FRY,"So, what is Freedom Day? Sounds like some kind of feminine hygiene product.",FRY
12689,BENDER,You know? Like how I live every day.,BENDER
12691,FARNSWORTH,"Of course, it wouldn't be Freedom Day without the traditional Freedom Tub!",FARNSWORTH
12693,FRY,Wow! Nude hot-tubbing? That's all I need to hear about Freedom Day!,FRY
12699,FRY,(shouting) We're not listening!,FRY
12702,BENDER,"Scuse me, comin' through. Freedom train arriving on track one.",BENDER
12718,FRY,Anyone who laughs is a Communist!,FRY
12731,BENDER,"Scuse me, comin' through. Freedom train, step aside. You too, fatso. Freedom!",BENDER
12732,LEELA,"Cool your jowls, Nixon. You may not like it that Dr. Zoidberg desecrated a flag. You might even find the image of it festering in his bowels somehow offensive. But the right to freedom of expression is guaranteed by the Earth constitution.",LEELA
12740,FRY,They sure hate Dr. Zoidberg.,FRY
12741,BENDER,Pft. Posers! I was hating Zoidberg before it was cool.,BENDER
12742,FRY,Where are we ever going to find a lawyer to take his case?,FRY
12743,LEELA,I'll ask the head of the ACLU. Once he's done singing.,LEELA
12748,FRY,I'll never remember that.,FRY
12750,BENDER,"And you wanna defend Zoidberg? Are you familiar with the old robot saying ""Does Not Compute""?",BENDER
12752,BENDER,(sad) The sparks keep me warm.,BENDER
12754,FRY,"Wait, you're a lawyer? You're hired!",FRY
12755,FRY,"You OK there in the embassy, Zoidberg?",FRY
12767,BENDER,Court's kinda fun when it's not my ass on the line! Nachos?,BENDER
12772,BENDER,Six to three? I beat the spread!,BENDER
12802,LEELA,"Dr. Zoidberg, how can you claim to love freedom and then enslave all of Earth?",LEELA
12805,BENDER,What the hell is this dirt pile we're building anyhow?,BENDER
12807,FRY,I'm no good at being a slave. I'm thinking about graduate school. Y'know? To become a barber?,FRY
12808,LEELA,This can't go on. Today is the day we fight back!,LEELA
12809,BENDER,It's already 10 o'clock!,BENDER
12810,LEELA,"Oh, you're right. Tomorrow is the day we fight back.",LEELA
12813,FRY,"Hey, wait! I'm having one of those things. You know? A headache with pictures?",FRY
12815,FRY,"Back in my day, we didn't have your fancy all-digital weapons but we still managed to kill each other just fine.",FRY
12816,BENDER,"Ah, the crossbow. A pitiless, elegant killing machine. The Bender of the 15th century.",BENDER
12817,FRY,Not big enough. We need something that can take out an entire army. Something you could commit a war crime with--,FRY
12830,FRY,"You haven't won yet, Moivin! You didn't expect us to even go to a museum, much less steal this ancient heat-seeking missile.",FRY
12835,BENDER,"Hey, I need that to smoke!",BENDER
12836,FRY,"Zoidberg, how could you? I used to think you were cool.",FRY
12838,LEELA,"Zoidberg, you set us free! I feel like I could stand to hug you! I can't, but you know what I'm trying to say.",LEELA
12852,LEELA,Yeah. You got a telesonic transmission from Kif a couple hours ago.,LEELA
12858,BENDER,Not my fault if you don't check me! Messages erased.,BENDER
12863,LEELA [ON SCREEN],Say again. You're breaking up!,LEELA
12864,FARNSWORTH,Good news everyone. You'll be delivering pain medicine to the hive mind of Nigel 7.,FARNSWORTH
12867,FARNSWORTH,We could but we won't! It's a spaceship dammit not a prom limousine!  If anyone needs me I'll be in the Angry Dome.,FARNSWORTH
12868,LEELA,"This is a very long trip, so we'll all have to go into hibernative-naptosis to save oxygen.",LEELA
12869,BENDER,I don't even breathe oxygen!,BENDER
12874,LEELA,"OK, I was just at this part: Heyya!",LEELA
12908,BENDER,"Have a good one!  Aw, man!",BENDER
12914,LEELA,And not one of those bogus everyday miracles like a sunrise. Aren't you a male?,LEELA
12915,BENDER,"Yeah what's the deal? Just when I thought I'd figured out you biological creatures, its something else! Lemme at 'im!  Come...over...lemme...!",BENDER
12920,BENDER,Oh OK. but that better be all there is!,BENDER
12923,FRY,Dude hold up! Remember when Zapp blew a hole in the ship?,FRY
12925,FRY,Kif touched everybody there. Couldn't any one of us be the mother?,FRY
12930,BENDER,A test. I demand a test!,BENDER
12931,FARNSWORTH,"Even I laughed at me when I built this alien cross species genetic analyser but I guess I showed myself! Subjects, please enter the chamber.  Now to take a DNA sample.  When I pull this switch the maternifuge will spin at 10,000 RPM, seperating out everyone who isn't the mother....father...whatever.",FARNSWORTH
12933,FARNSWORTH,Good. Fry's ejection indicates that he is not the man-mom.  Nor is Captain Brannigan.,FARNSWORTH
12935,FARNSWORTH,Zoidberg?! What the hell were you doing in there?,FARNSWORTH
12939,LEELA,"Wow, this is all so confusing.",LEELA
12943,LEELA,Sorry I got your boyfriend pregnant.,LEELA
12951,FRY,Check it out y'all. Everyone we invited is here.,FRY
12953,FRY,So lets open the gifts!,FRY
12955,BENDER,It's my booties from when I was a kid.,BENDER
12961,LEELA,It means a lot to me. It's the basket my parents left me in at the Orphanarium.,LEELA
12978,LEELA,If it's so dangerous I'd better go with you. A gal has to protect her DNA.,LEELA
12981,BENDER,"Hey, what's this fat ugly thing? A frog? A toad? Or your momma!",BENDER
12996,BENDER,What are you looking at?,BENDER
13018,LEELA,There goes my DNA. What a disgusting and beautiful process.,LEELA
13026,LEELA,"Hi Mom, hi Dad! Ready for your big trip to the surface?",LEELA
13028,LEELA,"Dad, relax. You are being so mutant!",LEELA
13030,LEELA,"No one's wearing anything adorable over their head. Now listen, I could never ever be ashamed of my parents. I'll see you this weekend.",LEELA
13031,LEELA,"Hey, guess who I just got off the videophone with?",LEELA
13033,LEELA,My parents! They're coming up from the sewers for a visit Sunday.,LEELA
13035,LEELA,I'm getting them a special one-day surface permit from Citihall.,LEELA
13037,LEELA,Sure. Bare hands or weapon?,LEELA
13039,FARNSWORTH,"Good news anyone, the Swedish robot from pi-kea is here with the supercollider I ordered.",FARNSWORTH
13041,FRY,"Let's see what tools we'll need.  Uh-huh, Uh-huh,  Uh-huh! Alright, we're all set.",FRY
13042,BENDER,Nothing like the rustic wholesomeness of working with one's own hand.,BENDER
13043,BENDER,"Ah, there, finished. And with only six missing pieces!",BENDER
13044,FRY,Those Swedes sure know how to put in almost everything you need.,FRY
13045,LEELA,"Man, I'm sore all over. I feel like I just went ten rouns with Mighty Thor.",LEELA
13046,FRY,I feel like I was mauled by Jesus.,FRY
13048,FARNSWORTH,"Bad news nobody, the supercollider super-exploded. I need you to take it back and exchanged it for a wobbly CD rack and some of those ransid meatballs.",FARNSWORTH
13050,LEELA,I don't believe that story for a second.,LEELA
13052,FRY,There's no bus to Jersey City.,FRY
13055,FRY,"I'm too scared to find my pocket. Here, I'll just take of my pants and give you those.",FRY
13057,LEELA,What the? Hey! Quit it!  Heyya!,LEELA
13060,LEELA,How did we manage to survive? What gave us those strange powers?,LEELA
13061,FRY,Maybe we're all wearing magic rings but they're invisible rings so we don't even realise it. Also you can't feel the rings.,FRY
13062,LEELA,"Fry, shut up and look at this! (Reading) May cause superpowers in humans!",LEELA
13063,FRY,Wow! A superpowers drug you can just rub into your skin? You'd think it'd be something you have to freebase.,FRY
13064,LEELA,"Let's see, which powers do we have? Super-strength?",LEELA
13068,LEELA,Yes sir!  Ability to command a loyalty of sea creatures?,LEELA
13069,FRY (SHOUTING),"Hey Zoidberg, get in here!",FRY
13072,LEELA,"Wow, superpowers! I'll be able to pack my day with twice as many humdrum activity.",LEELA
13073,FRY,"Leela, I think you're missing the big picture. When you were a kid what was your biggest fantasy?",FRY
13075,FRY,Whatever. The correct answer is: To be a superhero. We have superpowers and we're Americans. This is our chance.,FRY
13076,LEELA,"Hmm, I have been looking for a way to serve the community that incorporates my violence. Let's do it!",LEELA
13077,FRY,You'll barely regret this!,FRY
13078,BENDER,"Hey, a friend of mine said he mugged you today and you had superpowers.",BENDER
13079,LEELA,It's true. Thanks to this funky fresh cream.,LEELA
13080,FRY,Now me and Leela are forming an awesome crime-fighting duo.,FRY
13081,BENDER,"Wow, crime-fighting. Cool. You say you're a duo? Yeah duos are good. Of course sometimes they're a little short handed. See ya. With two humans you'd think there'd be a robot in there...to balance things out. But, whatever.  I have these three costumes you could use. But, I guess I'll just throw one away.",BENDER
13082,LEELA,We'd love to have you on the team Bender. But aren't you more on the supply side of crime?,LEELA
13083,FRY,"Plus the cream won't give you superpowers, you're a robot.",FRY
13084,BENDER,So? I'm already super-strong. And my arms do this.  Also I got this going.,BENDER
13085,LEELA (SHOUTING),Listen up New New York! There's a new group of superheros in town! And we're -,LEELA
13086,LEELA,(shouting) Sorry! (whispering) A new era of justice has begun.,LEELA
13089,BENDER,And Superking! The best one of the three!,BENDER
13096,FRY,Sure. I'm listed in the phone book so once I reveal my real name to you along with my home address and a copy of my birth certificate -,FRY
13097,LEELA,Are you crazy?? We have to keep our secret identities secret.,LEELA
13099,LEELA,Especially from everybody.,LEELA
13100,FRY,Give several reasons why.,FRY
13101,LEELA,"For one, superheroes cause a lot of collateral damage, and we don't wanna get our butts sued.",LEELA
13102,FRY,Or do we...? No I guess not.,FRY
13103,LEELA,"Also, if our identities get out, every crook in the city will be after us. Or, God forbid, our loved ones.",LEELA
13104,BENDER,Superking has no need for loved ones. How ya doin' kid?,BENDER
13106,LEELA,Thank you Mayor Poopenmeyer.,LEELA
13110,LEELA,"Well, so long. Keep in touch.",LEELA
13112,LEELA,"Oh, I completely forgot, I left my apartment on fire!",LEELA
13113,BENDER,"Uh, as for me, I'm late for my LSAT's.",BENDER
13114,FRY,And I can't take life anymore.,FRY
13118,FRY,Pack of highly. Got it!,FRY
13120,LEELA,You can count on us Mr Mayor! Justice away!,LEELA
13123,FRY,"Uh, Leela, how you gonna meet your folks tomorrow? We've already scheduled the Zookeeper for a 9am foiling at the museum.",FRY
13124,LEELA,Not a problem. I've cleverly arranged to meet my parents right there at the same museum at 10.,LEELA
13125,BENDER,"9, 10 a big fat hen.  The name...Bender!",BENDER
13126,LEELA,I can't believe the Zookeeper is this late for his own heist. It's just rude! Total hell! It's 10! I'm supposed to meet my parents and I'm still in my secret costume!  There they are!,LEELA
13134,LEELA,You're not stealing anything! Nobody hit the deck!,LEELA
13139,BENDER,You're going down my friend! Down Under!,BENDER
13145,LEELA,Forget it Zookeeper! You're going into captivity!,LEELA
13147,LEELA,"No, Fry you can't fall fast enough!",LEELA
13148,BENDER,I got it I got it!  I don't got it!,BENDER
13150,FRY,Yet the Zookeeper escaped. Thus proving that the deadliest animal of all is the Zookeeper!,FRY
13151,BENDER,You can get off me anytime.,BENDER
13152,LEELA,Oh no! My parents are leaving! I've gotta go change back into street-Leela.,LEELA
13155,LEELA,Mom? Dad? I showed up! And I got the audio tour for Treasures Of Liberachi's Tomb!,LEELA
13157,LEELA,I wanna tell you why I didn't show up. But I can't. Just please believe me that it was a very good reason. I'm sorry I disappointed you.,LEELA
13160,LEELA,"Oh, I can't take it! Mom, Dad, I'm Clobberella!",LEELA
13164,LEELA,"No, listen. It's very important that you never ever tell anyone. Under any circumstance.",LEELA
13166,LEELA,"Dad, you drink? No. Not even then.",LEELA
13168,LEELA,"In fact, I shouldn't even be wearing this around here.  It was brisk, I dressed in layers.",LEELA
13176,FARNSWORTH,"I don't remember much buddy, and you're no looker!",FARNSWORTH
13177,LEELA,"Uh Professor, isn't it time for your nap?",LEELA
13179,LEELA,Zookeeper! How did you know our real identities?,LEELA
13181,FRY,"Leela, is the person that parrot is mimicking telling the truth by proxy?",FRY
13182,LEELA (SADLY),"Yes. My parents were so hurt, I couldn't help it! (angry) But I distinctly told them not to tell anyone.",LEELA
13186,LEELA,Are you alright? Has he hurt you?,LEELA
13189,LEELA,"Alright Zookeeper, what do you want?",LEELA
13191,LEELA,We're out of options. We have to steal the Gemerald!,LEELA
13192,FRY,"But, should superheroes commit crime? Even to save lives? I need moral guidance. Bender?",FRY
13193,BENDER,"Hmm, the thought of stealing anythig fills Superking with disgust. But if it must be so, then let a museum heist be pulled!",BENDER
13194,FRY,Oh no! Our superpower cream is out of itself!,FRY
13195,LEELA,Check inside the cap! There might be a caked in goldmine!,LEELA
13196,FRY,El zilcho! I'm afraid we're boned.,FRY
13197,BENDER,El zilcho...is it too late to change my superhero name?,BENDER
13198,LEELA,Just be cool. Nobody knows we're superpowerly challenged.,LEELA
13199,FRY,"Man, this costume is so damn heavy!",FRY
13201,FRY,Owww! That...didn't hurt.,FRY
13203,LEELA,"Big O, little k my friend! Just checking if everything's alright!",LEELA
13208,LEELA,"Stay back! Or we'll, beat the tour out of you...using superpowers!",LEELA
13212,BENDER,"Well, here's your lousy Gemerald.",BENDER
13214,FRY,That seemed unnecessary.,FRY
13216,LEELA,"Mom, Dad, oh I'm so sorry I got you kidnapped by a crazy madman who tried to feed you to pirhanas.",LEELA
13218,LEELA,"No no, it's my fault for telling you I was a superhero.",LEELA
13220,LEELA,I just couldn't stand to have you to think I was ashamed of you.,LEELA
13227,BENDER,Hey Fry we've still got our costumes on. Wanna steal some more stuff?,BENDER
13228,FRY,"I guess, as long as you think it's right.",FRY
13233,FARNSWORTH,Pazuzu you ungrateful gargoyle! I put you through college and this is how you repay me?,FARNSWORTH
13234,FARNSWORTH,"Let's get this gargoyle hunt on the road. Driving gloves, driving goggles. Driving thong. There.",FARNSWORTH
13235,LEELA,"Uh, maybe I should drive.",LEELA
13236,FARNSWORTH,You? A woman? I'm trying to catch a monster not find the quickest route to the mall! Let me just adjust the seat.,FARNSWORTH
13237,FRY,"My God, he's gonna do it! Everybody, seatbelts to maximum buckling.",FRY
13239,LEELA,For heaven's gate Professor this ship can do 99% light speed. Why are we going at 35 miles an hour?,LEELA
13240,FARNSWORTH,Because we're in a hurry that's why.,FARNSWORTH
13241,LEELA,Plus you have the highbeams on!,LEELA
13242,BENDER,"Yo, Captain Cateracts, what are we doing here?",BENDER
13243,FARNSWORTH,"Oh it's 2:30, we can still catch the early bird dinner special.",FARNSWORTH
13244,FRY,"Uh, aren't we looking for your gargoyle?",FRY
13246,FARNSWORTH,Hello Mavis! Surprised to see me back again so soon?,FARNSWORTH
13248,FARNSWORTH,I expect you'll want to see my angry crotchety grandpa discount card!,FARNSWORTH
13250,FARNSWORTH,But it's good for a lifetime.,FARNSWORTH
13252,LEELA,Oh Lord! Teeth do not belong in your pants Professor.,LEELA
13253,FARNSWORTH,Well I can't keep them in my mouth. They're nuclear powered!,FARNSWORTH
13255,LEELA,No! No! It's tasted human blood!,LEELA
13257,LEELA,Professor we've talked it over and everyone thinks you're too old.,LEELA
13264,FARNSWORTH,"But I like being old. I don't have to talk to my parents, no one asks me to help move their stuff, I don't need to understand today's ""edgy TV sitcoms.""",FARNSWORTH
13265,LEELA,"OK OK, we're not gonna force you until I've finished this sentence. Get him!",LEELA
13270,FARNSWORTH,Give me back my floppy face!,FARNSWORTH

13275,FARNSWORTH,You sound just like my tennis instructor.,FARNSWORTH
13277,FARNSWORTH,"Oh I don't have time for this. I have to go and buy a single piece of fruit with a coupon and then return it, making people wait behind me while I complain.",FARNSWORTH
13278,FRY,He still sounds sorta old. Sorta real old.,FRY
13279,BENDER,"Step aside lady.  Like everything else in life, pumping is just a primative degenerate form of bending. (mean voice) C'mon Bender pump harder! Harder! (weak voice) I'm trying as hard as I can. (mean voice) Harder damn you!",BENDER
13280,FARNSWORTH,Well that was an utter waste of time.,FARNSWORTH
13282,FARNSWORTH,Poodlespit!  53 years old?  Now I'll need a fake ID to rent ultra-porn.,FARNSWORTH
13283,FRY,This is great Professor! We should go out and celebrate!,FRY
13284,FARNSWORTH,"Dear Lord, you've all reverted to your childhood forms!",FARNSWORTH
13286,FARNSWORTH,"While I try to restore our normal ages, I expect you all to go about your jobs like normal professionals.",FARNSWORTH
13293,LEELA,"Hey, this my chance to spend time with my parents too!",LEELA
13294,FRY,But your parents are gross sewer mutants.,FRY
13295,LEELA,"When I was an orphan I always wished I could grow up with my mom and dad. And now, thanks to being hurled backwards through time -",LEELA
13296,FARNSWORTH,That's not what happened! Shut up and go live with your parents.,FARNSWORTH
13297,LEELA,"It's gonna be totally awesome mom! You and me can bake and argue about my hairstyle hiding my pretty face. And if some kid picks on me, my dad can beat up his dad.",LEELA
13300,LEELA,"No! I want the real teen experience! Chores, curfew, the works!",LEELA
13308,FARNSWORTH,I've got to find a way to escape the horrible ravages of youth! Suddenly I'm going to the bathroom like clockwork every three hours! And those jerks at social security stopped sending me cheques! Now I have to pay them!,FARNSWORTH
13309,BENDER,"I'm tired of your yapping.  All you ever do is complain, you never try to make things better. Well I'm running away from this dead end family! I know there's a place for people like me with new ideas. There has to be!",BENDER
13311,BENDER,"Oh I'm going! You're gonna be all ""Where's Bender? I miss Bender!""",BENDER

13331,LEELA,"Moose, Mandy, this is my friend Fry - from the surface!",LEELA
13334,LEELA,"Hey come on, let's act like grown ups here! Wanna race?",LEELA
13338,FRY,"We missed the turn, we'll never catch them.",FRY

13346,FARNSWORTH,"Yes, I'd like to meet this ""moose."" But in the meantime I have good news. I may have solved our age problem.",FARNSWORTH
13348,FARNSWORTH,"It seems the Youthasizer tar was saturated with time-altering chronitons. A thin layer is still stuck to our DNA as well as Bender's Robot DNA or ""RNA.""",FARNSWORTH
13352,FARNSWORTH,Yes yes. Anyhow I've designed an oil eating bacterium that should take the tar right off.,FARNSWORTH
13353,FRY,C'mon! Lets go tell Leela so we can grow up together!,FRY
13354,LEELA,Thanks Professor but I don't want the treatment.,LEELA
13355,FARNSWORTH,"Don't you understand you little nitwit? Unless you're treated soon, the only way to restore your true age would be to grow into it! Just as God intended.",FARNSWORTH
13357,LEELA,My old life wasn't as glamourous as my webpage made it look. All I ever wanted was to grow up here. With you. Please?,LEELA
13360,FRY,I'll miss you Leela. I'll come ack and visit when I'm all grown up.,FRY
13364,FARNSWORTH,Initiating controlled infection.,FARNSWORTH
13367,FARNSWORTH,"Damn! the bacteria pigged out on the tar and now they're getting freaky deaky, spreading chronitons throughout our systems. We're getting younger by the minute!",FARNSWORTH
13369,FARNSWORTH,Word! We'll all keep getting younger and younger until we suffer a fate worse than death - pre-life! Then death.,FARNSWORTH
13370,FARNSWORTH,I've got to stop this reverse aging before we all shrivel up and suffer the agony of unbirth. Think you disco duck think!,FARNSWORTH
13372,FARNSWORTH,Get off me you parasitic lamprey!,FARNSWORTH

13382,FRY,"Professy's back!  Eww, you smell like smoking.  And drinking.",FRY
13383,FARNSWORTH,I had a few beers but I'm cool to drive.,FARNSWORTH

13429,FRY,What's this? This is the same toy surprise I got last time!  I can't work under these conditions. And without me there is no mission. I am the mission!,FRY
13430,LEELA (SHOUTING),We're back from the mission!,LEELA
13431,FRY,Wh-what? You went without me?,FRY
13432,BENDER (SHOUTING),You were looking up curse words in the dictionary. It seemed like a better use of your time.,BENDER
13433,FRY,"But, but I'm the delivery boy.",FRY
13434,LEELA,"Don't worry, everything went fine.",LEELA
13436,LEELA,We got medals! Good work team! We really pulled together on this one.,LEELA
13438,FRY,I'm real sorry I missed the mission. I wasn't there and you might have needed me.,FRY
13440,FRY,But if I'd been there I -,FRY
13446,FRY,"Listen Leela, let me make it up by taking you out to dinner tonight.",FRY
13447,LEELA,Nope. I've got a date with Chaz.,LEELA
13449,LEELA,I met him at that charity cock fight last week. He's the mayor's aide.,LEELA
13450,BENDER,"Ooo, you go mutant girl!",BENDER
13451,LEELA,I do go! He's a very important man.,LEELA
13452,FRY,"So? I'm just as important as him.  It's just that, the kind of importance I have, it doesn't matter if I...don't do it.",FRY
13453,FRY,I'm nobody. There are guys in the background with Mary Worth comics who are more important than me.,FRY
13454,BENDER,"Ah, buck up meatloaf. Bender'll take you out tonight and cheer you up. What do you wanna do? And I mean anything. You have the power! Name it an I'm there, you the man!",BENDER
13455,FRY,"Um, OK. Let's go bowling.",FRY
13463,LEELA,"Wow, free bread at a restaurant? Is there anything you can't do?",LEELA
13465,FRY,"Oh jeez, better not let Leela see me.",FRY
13466,LEELA,"Hey, I hear Fry.  Boy am I glad you're here!",LEELA
13467,FRY,You are? So things aren't working out with whatshisname?,FRY
13468,LEELA,"Actually...they are! Confidentially, I might not make it back to my apartment tonight! Could you walk Nibbler for me?",LEELA
13470,LEELA,And bring a baggy in case he drops a steamer. (shouting) Have a great night!,LEELA
13471,FRY,"Oh no, please, no!  Perfect!",FRY
13474,FRY,"Wait, I'm trying. It weighs as much as a thousand suns!",FRY
13477,FRY,I'm as worthless as this trashcan.,FRY
13479,FRY,"Oh Nibbler, at least I'm important to you. Even if it's only 'cause I clean up you poop.",FRY
13490,FRY,"Aww, aren't you a fuzzy wittle guy?",FRY
13492,FRY,Mightiness? Are you off your nut? I just got kidnapped by a bunch of guineapigs.,FRY
13506,FRY,"Hmm, I remember the square dancing stomachs, although that might have been a milanta commerical. Wait! The brains! I do remember! But no one else does. They said I was crazy.",FRY
13510,FRY,I did do the nasty in the pasty!,FRY
13512,FRY,So I really am important? How I feel when I'm drunk is correct?,FRY
13515,FRY,What's so evil about that?,FRY
13517,FRY,So they're trying to learn things?,FRY
13521,FRY,I'm as mad as I've ever been.,FRY
13526,FRY,"OK, let's go through this once more -",FRY
13529,FRY,"Sorry, what? I wasn't paying attention.",FRY
13535,FRY,I'm at the input console. I'm a little nervous and I've got brain in my buttcrack.,FRY
13538,FRY,"Hey wait, this brain knows everything about everything right?",FRY
13540,FRY,"Yeah yeah, but I can't pass up a chance to learn the answers to the greatest questions of all time.  Is it true that post-it stamp glue is made up of -",FRY
13543,FRY,Wait wait wait.  What really killed the dinosaurs?,FRY
13558,FRY,Well at least I did one important thing with my life. Leading good to victory over evil!,FRY
13561,FRY,The day I got frozen? What about it?,FRY
13565,FRY,"OK sheesh!  What happened to me, Philip J. Fry, on the night of December 31st 1999?",FRY
13568,FRY [ON SCREEN],Hello? Pizza delivery for uh...I. C. Wiener? Aw crud!,FRY
13569,FRY,"Eurgh! I can't believe how fat I look! Aw, Nibbler's there. Wait! What?!",FRY
13571,FRY,"I, I don't understand. You made me go in the freezer tube?",FRY
13573,FRY,You little runts froze me! You took away my life!,FRY
13575,FRY,No you can't. Shut your adorable trap!,FRY
13581,FRY,Go ahead. I deserve it. I wish those stupid racoons had never brought me to the future.,FRY
13585,FRY,Really? I can go back in time?,FRY
13588,FRY,That is interesting. Why?,FRY
13593,LEELA,I love rocket skating! But the wait is always so long. Fry once stood in line for six hours just to get me a ticket.,LEELA
13595,LEELA,You reserved the whole rink?,LEELA
13600,LEELA,"Aww, let's let those kids skate with us.",LEELA
13602,LEELA,"I know, and it's working. But think how much skating would mean to those kids.",LEELA
13604,LEELA,This may be their only chance to skate in their whole lives. Who are we to say they can't?,LEELA
13609,FRY,I hope your calculations are correct.,FRY
13641,FRY,"Whoa, thanks! If you ever need a saviour again, just ask.",FRY
13643,FRY,"Man, I can't wait to tell everyone what happened.",FRY
13645,FRY,Huh. Did everything just taste purple for a second? Oh well. Let's go home you dumb poop machine.,FRY
13646,LEELA,"Bender, would you do the honours?",LEELA
13648,FRY,Hey Leela. I guess I got this for you.,FRY
13649,LEELA,Oh. Thank you. You know what Fry. I don't care if you're not the most important person in the universe. It really makes me happy to see you right now.,LEELA
13650,FRY,Then I am the most important person in the universe.,FRY
13654,BENDER,"A hush comes over the crowd. The only sound is Bender calling everyone else a jerk and he swings!  And he slices it into the water, oh man!",BENDER
13655,FARNSWORTH,Bad news everyone. You're not good enough to go on your next mission.,FARNSWORTH
13659,FARNSWORTH,Because. And says me. It's an extremely dangerous mission that killed my last crew. And you're not nearly as good as them.,FARNSWORTH
13661,BENDER,We live to suck another day!,BENDER
13662,LEELA,We're just as good as any of those crews you sent to their deaths. What's the mission?,LEELA
13663,FARNSWORTH,Collecting honey. Ordinary honey.,FARNSWORTH
13664,LEELA,That doesn't sound so dangerous.,LEELA
13665,FARNSWORTH,This is no ordinary honey. It's produced by vicious space bees. A single sting of their hideous neuro-toxin can cause instant death!,FARNSWORTH
13667,FARNSWORTH,Your insides will boil out of your eye sockets like a science fair volcano!,FARNSWORTH
13669,FARNSWORTH,These bees are larger than most Buicks and twice as ugly!,FARNSWORTH
13670,FRY,Larger than an American sedan?  How big is the honey comb?,FRY
13674,LEELA,It'll take more than deadly deadly bees to keep us from doing our job. Come on boys!,LEELA
13675,FRY,But Leela we're no good!,FRY
13676,LEELA,"Listen, I'm scared too. But I'm more scared of disappointing myself.",LEELA
13677,FRY,I'm not scared of that at all!,FRY
13678,LEELA,Now bees communicate by dancing.,LEELA
13679,FRY,"Like my parents. Oh wait, that was hitting!",FRY
13680,LEELA,So this language cartridge will let you distract them.,LEELA
13681,BENDER,Ah good! I always have thoughts and feelings that can only be expressed through dance! (in bee) You stink! Bender's great! Deal with it!,BENDER
13682,LEELA,Bender quick! Waggle something!,LEELA
13683,BENDER (IN BEE),Hello fellow bees. How's the abdomen? Swollen with nectar I trust?,BENDER
13685,FRY,Leela let's turn back. There's absolutely no shame in wussing out.,FRY
13686,LEELA,"Relax, everything'll be fine!",LEELA
13687,FRY,Oh my God! The old Planet Express ship!,FRY
13691,LEELA,"Uh, couldn't make that out. Too much static!",LEELA
13693,LEELA,We found it! The honey comb hideout!,LEELA
13695,LEELA,Royal jelly. They feed it to the queen.,LEELA
13696,FRY,Bees make honey and jelly? Huh. How come nothing humans make taste good? Help! I can't swim in jelly as far as I know!,FRY
13697,LEELA,Look!  It's a baby queen! Aww she's so cute! You adorable wittle itty bitty fuzzy wuzzy -,LEELA
13698,FRY,Leela! Stop bonding and lets go! I got jelly in my underpants!,FRY
13699,LEELA,I'm taking this bee with us. With queen we can build a hive and make more honey ourselves. Let me just pack her a lunch and we'll go.,LEELA
13700,BENDER (IN BEE),Pick up the pace lady! I'm sick of shaking my booty for these fat jerks!  I didn't mean you're all fat. Just fatso there.,BENDER
13703,LEELA,This is where we distinguish ourselves from the last crew. Activate emergency high speed self contained escape pack crisis response unit! Quick!,LEELA
13706,FRY,We made it! We're alive!,FRY
13707,LEELA,Burn on that old crew! The only things they did better than us were suck and die!,LEELA
13708,FRY,Leela we got lucky this time but you should be more careful. I don't want anything to happen to you.,FRY
13709,LEELA,"Thanks, but I can look out for myself. Frankly I can smell danger a mile away.",LEELA
13710,FRY,Look out!  You want her you'll have to go through me.,FRY
13711,LEELA,You call that a wound? That's a boo boo top! But thanks for trying to save me Fry! Fry?  He's...he's dead.,LEELA
13712,BENDER (CRYING),Who will make Bender waffles just the way he likes them now?,BENDER
13713,LEELA (CRYING),It was all my fault! He died because of me!,LEELA
13714,FARNSWORTH,No no no no no no no.  I'm lying to make her feel better.,FARNSWORTH
13723,FARNSWORTH,This makes me the oldest member of my family.,FARNSWORTH
13725,BENDER,"All those times I said ""Kill all humans"" I'd always whisper ""except one."" And Fry was that one. And I never told him so.",BENDER
13727,LEELA (CRYING),They say a spoonful of space honey helps ease the pain.  It's good.  I feel funny. Haha funny!,LEELA
13729,LEELA,Fry? I thought you were dead.,LEELA
13730,FRY,"Nope, I'm better than ever. Before the accident I couldn't do this!",FRY
13731,LEELA,Impressive! But it does sorta support my You-Are-Dead theory.,LEELA
13732,FRY,Then I'll prove I'm alive! By telling you something only I could know. There's a surprise for you in my locker. I got it at a Swedish novelty shop before we left.,FRY
13733,LEELA,It's too beautiful to open! Can I open it?,LEELA
13734,FRY,Sure. There's just one thing I want you to.,FRY
13738,LEELA,In my dream Fry said he hid a gift for me in my locker. If it's true then he must still exist in some form.,LEELA
13739,FARNSWORTH,"Oh course he still exists. As a frozen corpse in outer space!  Oh, I made myself sad.",FARNSWORTH
13742,BENDER,"Well, I feel better now. Pawning all the stuff in Fry's locker helped give me closure.",BENDER
13743,LEELA,Was there anything in there that might have been a gift for me?,LEELA
13744,BENDER,No. Nothing. Not at all. No way José! Here it is.,BENDER
13745,LEELA,You took this from Fry's locker?,LEELA
13746,BENDER,Hey the guy's dead! There's no law against grave robbing!,BENDER
13747,LEELA,That proves it. Fry is alive somewhere and he's reaching me in my dreams.,LEELA
13749,FARNSWORTH,Lay down here and we'll do some tests. If Fry is out there then Leela's brain could be acting as a five pound ouija board.,FARNSWORTH
13750,LEELA,Is this some sort of brain scanner?,LEELA
13751,FARNSWORTH,"Some sort yes. In France it's called a ""guillotine.""",FARNSWORTH
13752,LEELA,Professor! Can't you examine my brain without removing it?,LEELA
13754,BENDER,"Hey, what if Fry wasn't actually dead when we buried him? Y'know like Julia Roberts?",BENDER
13755,FARNSWORTH,Well I suppose there's a slim -  I don't believe it!,FARNSWORTH
13756,LEELA,What is it? Is Fry alive in some other dimension or something?,LEELA
13757,FARNSWORTH,"No. According to this gizmometer, Fry is dead and nothing can bring him back! Remarkable.",FARNSWORTH
13758,LEELA,"But, my dream. Your science can't unprove that! How could I have know the gift was in Fry's locker?",LEELA
13760,LEELA,Are you saying I'm going crazy?,LEELA
13761,FARNSWORTH,"No no, no one's saying that! But I'm certainly thinking it loudly.",FARNSWORTH
13762,FRY,"Hi Leela! I'm just gonna keep talking, even if you can't hear me. Blah blah blah, blah blah blah blah blah.",FRY
13763,LEELA,"Shut up, I can hear you. The Professor says you're just a dream.",LEELA
13764,FRY,Oh yeah?  Could a dream take you dancing in an illusion garden?,FRY
13765,LEELA,"Well yes, technically. It's still very sweet of you.",LEELA
13766,FRY,Then what if we shared a sleigh ride across the ice fields of Hiperia?,FRY
13767,LEELA,Oh Fry you must be alive! I've never been treated so romantically by my own imagination before!,LEELA
13768,FRY,"Here, take my jacket. You look a little cold.",FRY
13769,LEELA,Thank you. It's all so beautiful I forgot how many hundreds of degrees zero it must be. I just wish I could convince the others you're alive.,LEELA
13770,FRY,You can. All you have to do is wake up.,FRY
13771,LEELA,No no! Don't say that! This is real!,LEELA
13772,LEELA,Not another dream!  Fry's jacket! The one he was buried in! My dream was real! He's alive!,LEELA
13774,LEELA,Fry's alive! I have proof!,LEELA
13777,LEELA,But he gave me his jacket. Look.,LEELA
13778,FARNSWORTH,That's not Fry's jacket. Fry's jacket is red! That's your jacket. An off the rack lime green affair.,FARNSWORTH
13779,LEELA,But Fry...his jacket...and when I woke up it was on me.,LEELA
13781,LEELA [SQUEEZING],I am not under stress dammit!,LEELA
13784,LEELA,Oh. Maybe I am freaking out a little.,LEELA
13785,BENDER,A little? You're screwier than my Aunt Rita! And she's a screw!,BENDER
13786,LEELA,I need to calm down. I'd better take some more of that space honey.,LEELA
13787,FARNSWORTH,You've been taking space honey? Be careful you purple haired imbecile!,FARNSWORTH
13790,LEELA,"One spoonful to calm me down.  OK, I've got a pretty good calm going! Two spoonfuls to help me sleep.  Uh oh, still awake. I guess one more spoonful couldn't hurt. Oh my gosh! I'd better get a sponge! Fry?  Is that you? I don't need a sponge!",LEELA
13791,FRY,Why and I sticky and naked? Did I miss something fun?,FRY
13792,FARNSWORTH,"Incredible! According to the gizmometer, Fry touched the royal jelly in the space hive, leaving an imprint of his DNA and brainwaves. Then, when it spilled on the couch, it recombined with trace amounts of Fry's hair and skin -",FARNSWORTH
13793,BENDER,And blood! Don't forget about Fry's blood!,BENDER
13794,FARNSWORTH,"Yes Bender, thank you. In short, the various fluids Fry left in the couch caused the royal jelly to regenerate his entire being!",FARNSWORTH
13796,BENDER,This is great! My buddy's alive and his credit cards are valid again!  Lets go get hammered!,BENDER
13798,LEELA,"Fry, I'm so glad I didn't kill you.",LEELA
13800,LEELA,Feeling responsible for your death was driving me mad. But now everything is alright.,LEELA
13802,LEELA,What? What do you mean?,LEELA
13804,LEELA,Wake up? Oh no! No! It can't be!,LEELA
13806,LEELA,"I'm cracking up. In my dreams I'm happy because Fry is alive, but when I'm awake my mind plays tricks on me.",LEELA
13809,BENDER,But when you worry you make it double.,BENDER
13810,FARNSWORTH (SINGING),The landlord says your rent is late...,FARNSWORTH
13820,BENDER (SINGING),Take us home Bender! Don't worry!,BENDER
13823,LEELA,"Uh, were you just singing?",LEELA
13824,BENDER,No I was telling you not to worry. I'm not allowed to sing - court order.,BENDER
13825,LEELA,"I'll find Fry's coffin, take his corpse and keep it under my mattress to remind me he's really dead. That'll prove I'm not insane.",LEELA
13826,LEELA,"OK, it's just an ordinary coffin. Containing my ordinary dead friend, who I killed.",LEELA
13827,LEELA,What happened? Why am I in my apartment?,LEELA
13830,LEELA,"OK, I'm insane! But I'm still sane enough to know it.  The only time I feel alright is in my dreams. With you.  Three spoonfuls. Then I can dream forever.  One.  Two Here goes. Goodbye waking world.",LEELA
13831,FRY'S PHOTO,"Leela! No!  Listen to me, you don't want to lie in bed like a vegetable and do nothing the rest of your life. I've tried it. Bedsores hurt!",FRY
13832,LEELA (CRYING),Then what am I s'posed to do?,LEELA
13835,FRY'S PHOTO,You can! The Leela I know doesn't give up this easily.,FRY
13836,LEELA,OK. I'll try.  Go away!,LEELA
13837,FRY'S PHOTO,I don't know if you can hear me Leela but there's something I wanna tell you. I love you.,FRY
13838,LEELA (CRYING),I'm so scared Fry I don't know what to do.,LEELA
13839,FRY'S PHOTO,Just wake up Leela. Please. Just wake up.,FRY
13840,LEELA (CRYING),I don't understand what you mean!,LEELA
13841,FRY (CRYING),Just wake up. Please. Just wake up Leela.,FRY
13844,LEELA,Of course I'm awake. You wouldn't stop waking me.  Where am I?,LEELA
13845,FRY,In the hospital. The ambulance brought you here right after the bee stung you.,FRY
13846,LEELA,But the bee stung you. It barely touched me.,LEELA
13847,FRY,Stinger went right through me and you got all the poison. My new spleen came from a guy who liked to motorcycle.,FRY
13849,BENDER,You were in the best coma I've ever seen!,BENDER
13851,LEELA,Really? How long was I out?,LEELA
13854,FRY,"I though that if you heard a familiar voice, it might help keep your mind together. But, who knows if it really got through.",FRY
13855,LEELA,It got through Fry.  It got through.,LEELA
13858,FRY (SHOUTING),"I know you've rejected me a lot before but frankly I wasn't sure we were right for each other either, but now I am! So how 'bout a date tonight?",FRY
13859,LEELA,"(shouting): Sorry I think I, um, I think I left my toaster on.",LEELA
13860,FRY (SHOUTING),"C'mon Leela, what's the real reason you won't go out with me?",FRY
13861,LEELA (SHOUTING),"Look, I'm embarrassed to admit this but you forced me to. I can't go out tonight because ......I have sweaty boot rash!",LEELA
13863,FRY,"So, will you go out with me?",FRY
13864,FARNSWORTH,"Good news everyone, I'm still technically alive! Yes!  But I need to you to dispose of this crazy ass experiment that almost killed me.  You'll have to throw it into the sun itself, for only the thermonuclear inferno of the sun has enough energy to ensure its total destruction!",FARNSWORTH
13865,BENDER,I can hit it with a shovel!,BENDER
13866,FARNSWORTH,That's not good enough.,FARNSWORTH
13867,BENDER,This one time I pounded a guy into the ground like a stake with a shovel!,BENDER
13870,FARNSWORTH,No peeking!  I don't know what's in there but I'm sure our minds would be unable to comprehend -,FARNSWORTH
13872,FARNSWORTH,"I don't care.  Listen well: No matter what happens, no matter how great your curiosity, you are forbidden to look in this box. Forbidden!  Pretty tantilising though!",FARNSWORTH
13873,FRY,Whatever's in there it's the only thing I've ever wanted.,FRY
13876,LEELA,Right! If they try to look in the box.,LEELA
13878,FRY,Let's just forget about the box. The Professor said to stay away.,FRY
13879,BENDER,"Fry, how can you be so naive? He was joking. Get it?",BENDER
13881,BENDER,That's what makes it so funny!  OK he wasn't joking now shut up and follow me.,BENDER
13882,FRY [FROM VENT],Ow it's hot! The butter in my pocket is melting!,FRY
13883,BENDER,We thank you Bender for the gift we are about to receive!,BENDER
13884,FRY,Tangled up Christmas lights! We can take shifts untangling them!,FRY
13885,BENDER,Unlabled booze! Widemouth too!,BENDER
13886,LEELA,That oughta keep those dopes occupied. I can guard the real box in peace now that no one's curious about it.,LEELA
13887,LEELA,"Well, I got through the night and no one looked in the box. Not even me. The person who gave up her whole evening to watch it. A whole evening of TV gone. What a mockery of justice it is that I can't take even a little tiny peek! I need coffee.  OK. Heads I look, tails I don't.  Oh yeah! Heads! I mean - alright then!  No. I have a duty not to look. But then again, I promised the coin I would.  Oh it's deep. Deeper than a small box should be.",LEELA
13888,LEELA,Ouch! My lawyer will hear about this!,LEELA
13889,FRY 1,"Leela, what have you done?",FRY
13890,LEELA,"Nothing. What do you mean ""why was I looking in the box?""",LEELA
13891,FRY 1,I mean your hair. It's all different-y.,FRY
13893,BENDER 1,You know it! Large and in charge!,BENDER
13894,FARNSWORTH 1,"Leela? Oh, there's a woman for you! Always dying her hair instead of not looking in a box.",FARNSWORTH
13895,LEELA,I didn't dye my hair. This is how I always look.,LEELA
13896,BENDER 1,"No, that's how you always look.  This throws my entire perception of reality into question. Clone? Robot? Or long lost twin? Taking all bets! I also offer video poker!",BENDER
13897,FRY 1,It's some guy wearing a Leela costume! Get him!,FRY
13898,LEELA,Hold it! You have this all wrong. I just fell into the box and then I fell out somehow.,LEELA
13900,FARNSWORTH 1,"No wait, I've got it! I know what's in the box. Oh I've been as dumb as Fry!",FARNSWORTH
13902,FARNSWORTH 1,It contains a parallel universe! And when you create a parallel universe it's almost always populated by evil twins!,FARNSWORTH
13903,LEELA,"No look, I am not evil. My loan officer said so.",LEELA
13904,FARNSWORTH 1,Oh you'd like us to believe that wouldn't you Leela? Or should I say Eveela?,FARNSWORTH
13905,BENDER 1,Oh this is awful. Somewhere there's a Bender more evil than me. I do my best dammit!,BENDER
13906,FARNSWORTH 1,Leela?  The good Leela.  I want you to snoop around the other universe and find out how evil they are.  Here.,FARNSWORTH
13907,LEELA,I tell you they're not evil. But don't be confused. They are jerks.,LEELA
13908,LEELA 1,Come out of your universe with your hands up!,LEELA
13909,FRY,Oh wow. It's like that drug trip I saw in that movie when I was on that drug trip.,FRY
13910,FARNSWORTH,Astonishing. I must have created a parallel universe!,FARNSWORTH
13911,FARNSWORTH 1,Baldercrap! I created your universe! All you created was my fist parallel to your face!,FARNSWORTH
13913,LEELA,Look. It doesn't matter who created what. The important thing is - yah!,LEELA
13914,LEELA 1 (WHISPERING),"We're exactly the same. I know all her moves. Therefore, I've got the upper hand.",LEELA
13915,FARNSWORTH 1,"Now now, perfectly symmetrical violence never solved anything.",FARNSWORTH
13916,FARNSWORTH,Let's recap what's happened so far. As you can see I accidentally created a box containing your universe.,FARNSWORTH
13917,FARNSWORTH 1,"While I, in a simultaineous blunder created a box containing your universe.",FARNSWORTH
13918,LEELA,"This is getting confusing. Why don't we call our universe ""Universe A"" and this universe ""Universe B""?",LEELA
13919,BENDER 1,"Hey, why can't we be universe A?",BENDER
13923,FRY,"We called it first. Besides, this place kinda feels like a ""B"" y'know?",FRY
13924,LEELA 1,"Alright, you can be crummy universe A. And we'll be universe 1!",LEELA
13925,FRY 1,"Or ""The Mongooses,"" that's a cool team name. The Fighting Mongooses!",FRY
13926,FARNSWORTH,Wait a minute. If our universes are identical then why did our Leela look into the box and your Leela didn't?,FARNSWORTH
13927,LEELA 1,Well to be honest I tossed a coin. It came up tails so I didn't look.,LEELA
13928,LEELA,That's weird. Mine came up heads so I did.,LEELA
13929,FARNSWORTH,Interesting. Apparently the key difference between our universes is that coin flips have opposite outcomes.,FARNSWORTH
13930,BENDER,That explains fruity here!  I tossed a coin to pick my finish. Foghat grey!,BENDER
13931,BENDER 1,Hey! Bite my glorious golden ass!,BENDER
13932,FARNSWORTH,Your people and your slight differences disgust me. I'm going home. Where's that blue box with our universe in it?,FARNSWORTH
13933,FARNSWORTH 1,Oh you'd like to get back to your evil universe wouldn't you? And destroy your box with our universe inside it.,FARNSWORTH
13934,FARNSWORTH,Nonsense! I would never do such a thing unless you would already have been going to do that!,FARNSWORTH
13937,FARNSWORTH 1,"In any case, I've hidden the box and it will remain hidden unitil I'm convinced you're not evil!  Everyone, keep an eye on your evil counterpart.",FARNSWORTH
13938,FARNSWORTH,And you all do the same!,FARNSWORTH
13939,LEELA 1,"Um, can Fry and I watch our parallel selves together? We have plans tonight.",LEELA
13941,FRY 1,Oh no no no. We're married.,FRY
13942,BENDER,I've got my eye on you boy!,BENDER
13943,BENDER 1,Don't even think about it lunch-pail! You'd be dead before you hit the ground!,BENDER
13944,BENDER,Good point. Whatyya say we just hit a strip joint?,BENDER
13945,BENDER 1,"I was waitin' for one of us to say that! Bender A, you're a prince among robots! Can you forgive me for distrusting you?",BENDER
13946,BENDER,"Aw, I can't stay mad at what is essentially me. I love me!",BENDER
13951,LEELA,"So Fry, Leela, how'd you two get together?",LEELA
13952,FRY 1,Funny story. I asked Leela out a million times and she just kept rejecting me.,FRY
13953,LEELA 1,"I'd make up things like ""I have sweaty boot-rash"" or ""I have to meet the President""!",LEELA
13954,FRY 1,"Oh man, you never heard such excuses! But, like a dope, I believed her. Looking back on it now it's kinda funny!",FRY
13955,FRY (SARCASTIC),"It sure is, right Leela? Funny. Ha ha ha ha!",FRY
13956,LEELA 1,Then one night when Fry asked me out the only excuse I could think of involved ghosts. I knew he wouldn't buy it so I did what I always do in those situations.,LEELA
13958,LEELA 1,I flipped a coin. It came up heads and we went out.,LEELA
13959,FRY,You mean you flipped the coin too? And it was tails? So that's why you said you had to meet that ghost.,FRY
13960,LEELA 1,You really missed out on something Leela. That date was magical.,LEELA
13961,FRY 1,"One year later I gave Leela a diamond scrunchy, and we were married.",FRY
13963,FRY,One year later I got beat up at a Neil Diamond concert by a guy named Scrunchy!,FRY
13964,FARNSWORTH 1,Well that was pointless.,FARNSWORTH
13965,FARNSWORTH,"Say, I hope you won't think it ""evil"" of me to ask how you got that stylish head wound!",FARNSWORTH
13966,FARNSWORTH 1,Oh this old thing? I was experimenting to see if I could remove my own brain!,FARNSWORTH
13967,FARNSWORTH,Of course! I had the same idea! I flipped a coin to decide if I should proceed but it came up tails - so I didn't. How'd it go?,FARNSWORTH
13968,FARNSWORTH 1,Well getting the brain out was the easy part. The hard part was getting the brain out!,FARNSWORTH
13980,FARNSWORTH,"After carefully reading the scriptures, we've concluded that none of us are evil!",FARNSWORTH
13981,FARNSWORTH 1,"Yes, the Bible is the real good news! Anyhow, you're all free to go back to your own universe.",FARNSWORTH
13983,LEELA 1,"Hermes, aren't you confused about the fact thats there's two of everybody?",LEELA
13985,FARNSWORTH 1,Your granny can go to hell! I've hidden the box so that no one can destroy the home universe of my handsome friend here!,FARNSWORTH
13986,FARNSWORTH,Oh go on! Wait a second. If your Hermes was about to destroy the box containing our universe...,FARNSWORTH
13990,LEELA,So we go through the box and stop Hermes?,LEELA
13991,FARNSWORTH,Right. Good thing Professor B there hid it in the sealed clam tank. No one but a crazy lobster would look there!,FARNSWORTH
13996,BENDER 1,Our universe is doomed!,BENDER
13998,FARNSWORTH 1,Now don't give up yet you cry babies. The box is gone but we still have one preposterously slim hope.,FARNSWORTH
14000,FARNSWORTH,No. We must attempt to create another box containing our universe! Doy!,FARNSWORTH
14001,FRY 1,Well? Is that your universe in there?,FRY
14004,FARNSWORTH 1,Yes it's the apocalypse alright. I always thought I'd have a hand in it!,FARNSWORTH
14005,BENDER 1,"I'm not sad. Because I finally found someone as great as me! It's like I always say: ""Make new friends and keep the old. One is silver...""",BENDER
14006,BENDER,"""...and the other's gold!""",BENDER
14008,LEELA 1,The idiots have the box!,LEELA
14012,FARNSWORTH 1,"We'll have to search a universe. Everyone, grab a length of wire first so you can find your way back.",FARNSWORTH
14015,FRY,"Yo, did two shellfish in scrubs go by?",FRY
14019,LEELA,"Uh, have you robot versions of yourselves seen any extra Zoidbergs around here?",LEELA
14021,BENDER 1,Hey man look what I snagged from the leprachaun universe!,BENDER
14022,BENDER,Yeah leprachaun universe is fine...if you haven't seen pirate universe!,BENDER
14027,FARNSWORTH 420,"Baby they're somewhere, everything's like somewhere! Place is kinda au natural right now.",FARNSWORTH
14030,FARNSWORTH 420,Dig it! All of you living in this boxed is like seriously freaked up!,FARNSWORTH
14031,FARNSWORTH,"Nonsense, why there's a whole universe in there.",FARNSWORTH
14032,FARNSWORTH 420,"Dude, there's a universe in all of us.",FARNSWORTH
14034,FARNSWORTH,Get a job! (shouting into the parabox) We've got the box. Everyone pull your wires.,FARNSWORTH
14035,FARNSWORTH,Hurry! Back to Universe A!,FARNSWORTH
14036,FARNSWORTH,Hermes don't press that button!,FARNSWORTH
14039,FRY,"There but for the flip of a coin go we. So uh Leela, seeing how the universe wasn't destroyed, you wanna catch an ape fight? Y'know? Together?",FRY
14040,LEELA,"Well, I guess you deserve one more flip.",LEELA
14042,LEELA,"Y'know, lets just say it's heads.",LEELA
14044,FARNSWORTH,There. That space-time inversion has given us their box and vice-versa!,FARNSWORTH
14045,LEELA,So what you think you just explain to us is that -,LEELA
14046,FARNSWORTH,Correct! This box contains our own universe!,FARNSWORTH
14048,LEELA,"Bender, quit destroying the universe!",LEELA
14050,FARNSWORTH,"Yes, all that is and ever shall be is in that box! And the box itself is probably worth something too. We must cherish it, as we cherish every moment of our lives.",FARNSWORTH
14057,BENDER,What to do what to do? One $300 hookerbot or 300 $1 hookerbots?,BENDER
14058,LEELA,I'm going to swim with the whale! They're the gentle giants of the deep.,LEELA
14059,FARNSWORTH,I'm well aware of that.,FARNSWORTH
14064,FRY,"That's it! I'm getting a hundred cups of coffee! Starting now.  Coffee machine, one cup of coffee please.",FRY
14071,LEELA,What little there is to be had.,LEELA
14080,FARNSWORTH,As a man it has become too much of a chore for me to clean out my wrinkles each day. Is it true that stem cells may fight the aging process?,FARNSWORTH
14082,FARNSWORTH,One pound of stem cells please.,FARNSWORTH
14084,BENDER,"Say buddy, why's this grand cigar so pricy?",BENDER
14086,BENDER,Give me 300 bucks worth!,BENDER
14088,BENDER,"Oh alright, I'll just take these $300 burglars tools then.",BENDER
14090,BENDER,"So uh, what time d'you close tonight?",BENDER
14098,FARNSWORTH,Hey! Turn that damn music......up!,FARNSWORTH
14104,LEELA,I'd like a pass to swim with Mushu please.,LEELA
14106,LEELA,Then why'd you become a whale biologist?,LEELA
14108,FRY,"Uh, I'll have a coffee.",FRY
14125,LEELA,"Hmm, this may seem like a huge coincidence but I happen to have it in with that whale!",LEELA
14128,FRY,Yeah yeah yeah keep it comin' put the pot down get away!,FRY
14130,FARNSWORTH,The key is to grab life by the hojos! Live every day like it might be your last!,FARNSWORTH
14132,FARNSWORTH,One bowl of mild verena.,FARNSWORTH
14138,BENDER,Le Grand Cigar! She's mine! And with absolutely no consequences!,BENDER
14143,FRY (SHOUTING),This isn't Yemeni! It's Sulowesi!  And the cup's shaking I don't want my coffee shaking!,FRY
14144,BENDER,You seem a tad wound up buddy. And your face is greasy! Real greasy. You been up all night?,BENDER
14145,FRY,Of course I've been up all night! Not because of caffine it was insomnia I couldn't stop thinking about coffee I need a nap.  Coffee time!,FRY
14146,BENDER,Ah! Mighty fine smokable!,BENDER
14147,FRY,Fancy cigar why don't you smoke it already? Puff puff go go go go go!,FRY
14148,BENDER,"Nah, you can't blow smoke from such a majestic stogy in just anyone's face. I'm saving it for the fancy pants at Zapp Brannigan's black tie reception. You comin'?",BENDER
14152,LEELA,"OK Mushu, its feeding time!  Oh crud, he ate my suit!",LEELA
14184,FARNSWORTH,"Wha?  Uh, gotta go, uh fight club!",FARNSWORTH
14186,FARNSWORTH,I'm afraid the face you fell in love with was actually just a blob of living gunk I bought with my tax refund.,FARNSWORTH
14188,FARNSWORTH,That certainly is honest.,FARNSWORTH
14190,FARNSWORTH,"You, fat as the Queen of Seacows.",FARNSWORTH
14209,FARNSWORTH,We're trapped my sweet hippopotamus!,FARNSWORTH
14210,FRY,Coffee coffee coffee coffee coffee coffee coffee coffee coffee coffee!,FRY
14213,LEELA,I think we were saved by a mysterious orange blur.,LEELA
14224,LEELA,At least we got a few mildly interesting stories out of it.,LEELA
14226,BENDER,"Speaking of which, my story kinda peetered out without me learning a lesson!",BENDER
14231,FARNSWORTH,Oh Lord. Hiking is always such a strain on the buttocks.,FARNSWORTH
14232,FRY,Shh! What was that sound?,FRY
14233,BENDER,"It wasn't a bird's nest falling. That sounds like this.  Aww, they're so cute when they're scared!",BENDER
14234,FRY,I meant the sound Bigfoot just made. He's been sighted a lot in this area recently. Just last week a blind hiker felt him!,FRY
14235,FARNSWORTH,Don't tell me you actually believe in Bigfoot you blathering ninny-hammer!,FARNSWORTH
14236,FRY,"Of course I do! Bigfoot's my hero. Growing up, he was the celebrity I most identified with.",FRY
14238,FRY,'Cause he was a loner who hated the popular monsters yet longed to be one.,FRY
14240,LEELA,"Ugh, enough emotions! This isn't a fat camp for God sake. (quietly) Though you wouldn't know it from looking.",LEELA
14243,BENDER,"Nah, I'm comfy out here under the stars. Real comfy!",BENDER
14252,FARNSWORTH,(shouting) Bunk! Bunk I say! Bring me a bag full of Bigfoot's droppings or shut up!,FARNSWORTH
14256,BENDER,Eh he's gone. He says you should keep wasting your life though.,BENDER
14260,FRY,"Sir, if I may, why don't you set up like a billion video cameras in the woods and see if he walks by one.",FRY
14262,BENDER,Hey look! Bigfoot! He's back!,BENDER
14264,BENDER,Up your face!  Everybody do the Bender!,BENDER
14269,FRY,You doin' alright out there buddy?,FRY
14270,BENDER,Better than these gnats!  That guy won't be goin' home to his kids!,BENDER
14271,BENDER,"Who's that? A wolf? Or some kind of boogen? Oh God I wish I was safe inside a tent.  (deep voice) Fry, Fry wake up! It's me! Bigface!",BENDER
14273,FRY,"Bigfoot? Is that you? I'm not like the others Bigfoot. I see through your monster coatings to the gentle loner inside. I bet you have a wounded racoon friend that you tenderly nurse back to health and go......and in the end they shoot you. But you teach us about things. Oh, it's a flying saucer. (shouting) Excuse me? You can't park here. The parking area's over there.  Wow nice tube!  Hey. Hey what's the big idea? Stop abducting me. Why does your vanity plate say ""Probe 1""?",FRY
14274,LEELA,"There's nothing so refreshing as the clean, crisp taste of old Canadian beer!",LEELA
14277,LEELA,"Bender raises a good point, where is Fry?",LEELA
14278,FRY,"Amy, you won't believe what happened......it was so scary that you wouldn't -  I know but listen it gets even scarier.",FRY
14279,FARNSWORTH,Fry! What in Sega Genesis happened to you?,FARNSWORTH
14280,FRY,That's what I'm trying to tell you. See -  Why are you all staring at me like that? Is there something on my face?,FRY
14282,LEELA,Someone should tell him.,LEELA
14287,BENDER,"Aww, I think it's sweet! You chopped off your nose so you could look more like your hero. Me, Bender!",BENDER
14289,FRY,"In the woods, I was walking. For Bigfoot, looking and then aliens beamed me up.",FRY
14292,FRY,I'm a pathetic freak. My life is ruined.,FRY
14294,FRY,I'll never have another moment of happiness.,FRY
14295,LEELA,I know you're trying to mask your pain with humour but don't worry. I'm sure the Professor can clone you a new nose.,LEELA
14296,FARNSWORTH,Well there's no sense fretting. Good Lord you're ugly! The fact is your nose is gone and we'll never find out who did it or why.,FARNSWORTH
14297,BENDER,"(gasping) Guys, guys! There's something on television.",BENDER
14302,FRY,My nose is an aphrodisiac?  I'm gonna drop a barf!,FRY
14304,FRY,Blech! We have to track down my nose before some alien snarfs it and does the worm. Who's in?,FRY
14305,LEELA,Me and Bender and maybe Zoidberg if he feels like it.,LEELA
14308,FRY,"It's no use. We've been to ever scuzzy bazaar in the galaxy, including Pottery Barn.",FRY
14311,FRY,"Uh, I'm looking for human horn.",FRY
14313,LEELA,Of course not. In fact he's a crook.,LEELA
14314,BENDER,Yep. Stolen Pez anyone?,BENDER
14317,FRY,"Nope, uh-uh, eww!  Now look, this is the nose we want. Did you sell it to somebody?",FRY
14320,LEELA,That's Lrrr! Ruler of the planet Omicron Persei 8!,LEELA
14326,BENDER,Yep. That's exactly the lie we used to get past your guards.,BENDER
14327,FRY,Oh great space king. I humbly beg you to return my human horn.,FRY
14331,LEELA,"Whoa, you guys have issues!",LEELA
14333,FRY,(sadly) Alright. I give up. I guess I'll just go home and marry a skunk.,FRY
14335,FRY,My nose! Light of my face!,FRY
14337,LEELA,Hold still Fry. I can reattach it with my emergency face laser.,LEELA
14338,FRY,Hey! You burned my cheek!,FRY
14339,LEELA,Yeah sorry I wasn't really concentrating.,LEELA
14340,FRY,"No I mean the singed flesh, I can smell it!  Those lilacs on the table.",FRY
14344,FRY,"Well, great seeing you, I guess we'll be on our -",FRY
14345,BENDER,"Yo, highness! Uh, just out of robo-curiosity, why would you use a guy's nose for an aphrodisiac instead of his...you know...wing dang doodle?",BENDER
14347,BENDER,"No sir-chee! The main event, so to speak, is downstairs near the wallet. Ever seen soccer players line up to block a free kick? They ain't covering their noses I'll say that much! Well, seeya!",BENDER
14349,FRY,"Hey, what've you heard?",FRY
14351,FRY,"OK, you can have my nose.",FRY
14358,FRY,Wait! I'm usually the first guy to toot my own lower horn -,FRY
14360,FRY,But in this case I just don't think it'll do any good.,FRY
14361,BENDER,(shouting) That's what she said!,BENDER
14362,LEELA,Let's face it. You two have deep relationship problems that can't be solved by an aphrodisiac.,LEELA
14363,FRY,However huge it might be.,FRY
14365,LEELA,"Well, why don't you think back to what brought you together in the first place?",LEELA
14372,FRY,Wh-What if we helped you get your passion back without the hassle of mutilating me?,FRY
14373,LEELA,"Yeah, we know a great place in the mountains. We could take you there for a romantic dinner under the stars.",LEELA
14376,FRY,Then it's a deal. We get one night. I keep my horn as long as you two end up doing the horizontal monster mash.,FRY
14378,BENDER,Bonjour. May I offer you a box of wine for the edge of the table?,BENDER
14382,FRY,"So, what can I get you this evening?",FRY
14384,FRY,"I'll just start you off with some bread. Some sexy, arousing bread!",FRY
14389,BENDER,(shouting) It's used to it!,BENDER
14390,FRY,"So uh, how are you two sneaky poopums doing?",FRY
14393,BENDER,"Boy, who knew a cooler could also make a handy wang coffin?  Hey, uh mind if I stick these in here?",BENDER
14395,LEELA,Don't worry Fry. Things look bad but I still have a trump card. The most beautiful love song ever written.  (singing badly) And I will always love you......will always love you...,LEELA
14399,FRY,"Come on freedom cage! Roll me to safety! Yes! I never thought I'd escape with my doodle, but I pulled it out!",FRY
14400,BENDER,(shouting) Just like at the movie theatre!,BENDER
14402,FRY,Bigfoot! He's real! I knew it. The Loch Ness Monster's book was right!,FRY
14406,BENDER,What are you doing with that?,BENDER
14416,BENDER,"(shouting) In this case ""small""!",BENDER
14420,LEELA,"Well Fry, it looks like you get to hold onto your lower horn.",LEELA
14421,BENDER,As usual!  (shouting) Run away!,BENDER
14426,FRY,So who should I root for? America or one of those countries I learned about at the Food Court?,FRY
14428,LEELA,"No, they're from the Republic Of French Stereotypes. Everybody hates them.",LEELA
14429,FARNSWORTH,"Oh, let's go check on Hermes. All this inspiring multi-culturalism is angrying up my blood.  Sweden? I don't think so!",FARNSWORTH
14432,LEELA,It does seem like Jamaica will be able to field a strong limbo team without you.,LEELA
14437,FRY,"But have they seen your...y'know...physique, since the old days?",FRY
14439,FARNSWORTH,"Don't worry, the fat pig will do fine thanks to this flabbo-dynamic spandex bodysuit I've designed.  It redistributes his weight, shifting his centre of gravity closer to his knees.",FARNSWORTH
14441,FARNSWORTH,Now that's a limboer's body!,FARNSWORTH
14443,BENDER,"Shut up Zoidberg, the robot bending events are starting!  Something tells me I could easily beat those trained professionals.",BENDER
14444,BENDER,"Wow, that guy must have to be like the world's greatest bender. My dreams of glory died before they began.",BENDER
14454,FARNSWORTH,"(shouting) Go bodysuit, go!",FARNSWORTH
14460,BENDER,"Well enough about Hermes, I couldn't win a medal either. Even at bending - the thing I was built to do. I'm so embarassed. I wish everybody else was dead.",BENDER
14462,BENDER,"Fembots?  Methinks a clever Manbot suitably disguised might win those events! But the charade would require subtlety, nuance, grace.",BENDER
14463,BENDER,"What do you mean I'm not registered? My name is Coilette and I'm from, uh...Robonia! Coilette's a chick's name!",BENDER
14465,BENDER,Ever been beaten up by a guy dressed like a chick?,BENDER
14469,BENDER,"I'm great! Everybody else sucks, except that guy Bender, he's really somethin'!",BENDER
14470,LEELA,You actually thought they'd let you walk away without an engine oil sex check?,LEELA
14471,BENDER,"(crying) Oh God, I'm not gonna get my medals! They're all I have to remember my Olympic career.  Wait, I've got it! Professor, make a woman out of me!",BENDER
14472,FARNSWORTH,Oh I think we should just stay friends.,FARNSWORTH
14473,BENDER,"I don't need friends, I need a sex change operation and give it to me now!",BENDER
14474,FARNSWORTH,Bender a robot sex change is a complex and dangerous procedure. Replacing your testosteroil with Fembot lubricants can cause wild mood swings. And the effects may be irreversible. Well let's get started!,FARNSWORTH
14478,FARNSWORTH,"I'm sorry ladies but I must do this. Not for you, not for Bender, but for the proud people of Robonia!",FARNSWORTH
14480,FRY,I can't watch this 'cause it's creepy and wrong and sick. However I will watch out of curiosity.,FRY
14481,FARNSWORTH,(shouting) Quiet! (talking) I'm about to begin the process of reshaping Bender's body into a tender delicate form.,FARNSWORTH
14482,FARNSWORTH,(dramatically) Draining male oil.  Infusing female oil.  Removing item.,FARNSWORTH
14488,LEELA,"I don't know which I'm more, enraged or disgusted!",LEELA
14491,FRY,But you're not really a lady anyway. Right?,FRY
14493,FARNSWORTH,"Dear Lord, a coaster! The Femzoil must be sacheting girlishly into your processor.",FARNSWORTH
14512,FRY,You gotta tell me. You're not actually attracted to Calculon right? And if you are don't tell me. Are you?,FRY
14514,LEELA,Well I think you dating a Manbot is a disgrace. And I refuse to be involved. And you have way too much lipstick on.,LEELA
14519,FRY,"But what if he wants to, I mean if he tries to...uh...Barry White?",FRY
14523,FARNSWORTH,"Oh dear. Her mood swings are getting wilder. She's becoming a slave to her emotions. Just like all women, particularly you Leela.",FARNSWORTH
14524,LEELA,I'm worried about him too Professor.,LEELA
14539,FRY,I'll miss you buddy. You've been like a brother and then a sister to me. And now you're getting married. I love you.,FRY
14541,FRY,Cool. What's for dinner?,FRY
14542,LEELA,What do you mean a scam?,LEELA
14544,FRY,That's marriage alright!,FRY
14545,LEELA,That is so unbelievably manipulative.,LEELA
14547,LEELA,Well I...uh...I thought I might like him on a full stomach.,LEELA
14567,FRY,So now you do wanna marry him?,FRY
14570,FARNSWORTH,You're falling into the final debilitating stages of womanhood. You've waited too long to switch back you dingbat!,FARNSWORTH
14571,LEELA,OK look. If I help you with this do you promise to get out of my gender and stay out?,LEELA
14573,LEELA,"Alright. Now there's no way to stop this marriage without hurting Calculon. But he's an actor. If there's one kind of pain he can handle, it's soap opera pain.",LEELA
14574,LEELA,"(whispering) OK, is everyone ready?",LEELA
14587,LEELA,Coilette! You she-devil!  You really thought you could steal those diamonds from me and Congo Jack?,LEELA
14592,FRY,Yes. And I have a message for you from Colonel Mitumba! He says this......is from Congo Jack.,FRY
14601,FARNSWORTH,Turn off that crap-o-rama! One mistake now and Bender will be trapped forever between the already ill-defined robot sexes.,FARNSWORTH
14603,FRY,"Well Bender, I hope this has taught you a lesson about changing your sex to win five gold medals.",FRY
14607,BENDER,"...drive to Vegas, pick up some Flooziebots and void their warranties all night long!",BENDER
14608,FRY,Yay my buddy's home! And his respect for women is back to normal.,FRY
14609,LEELA,I kind of hope this whole experience would have left you a little more open to your sensitive side.,LEELA
14610,BENDER,Yeah you'd think but what you gonna do?,BENDER
14616,FARNSWORTH,Sentimental drivel-poop.,FARNSWORTH
14617,FRY,C'mon Bender let's go. This chick flick is getting me all barfy.,FRY
14618,BENDER,Yeah. Emotions are dumb and should be hated.,BENDER
14622,BENDER,I said you two don't dress trampy enough. I still got it!,BENDER
14629,BENDER,"Oh my God, robot beely-boppers!",BENDER
14630,FRY,And there's a robot scratching post. You should try it out Bender.,FRY
14631,BENDER,"Please, I have some dignity.",BENDER
14633,FARNSWORTH,Like fun it is you glass headed wallaby!,FARNSWORTH
14636,FARNSWORTH'S KILLBOT,Such senseless aggression.,FARNSWORTH
14638,BENDER,The secret is to scratch 'em really really hard!,BENDER

14658,BENDER,"Uh, I never got the change.  Suckers.",BENDER
14660,BENDER,That new robot is great huh? Sure made me look like a pile of crap.,BENDER
14661,FARNSWORTH,Indeed. That's why I bought one to help around the office.,FARNSWORTH
14663,LEELA,Let's try him out. Robot 1-X? Can you clean Nibbler's skanky litterbox?,LEELA
14665,BENDER,Hey I could have done that if you'd asked me.,BENDER
14666,LEELA,I asked you five minutes ago.,LEELA
14667,BENDER,You call that a kiss? I'll show you! C'mere Nibbler!,BENDER
14668,FARNSWORTH,Oh look Bender if you want something to do stop making out and give us a hand.,FARNSWORTH

14675,BENDER,"Ohh! When I screamed ""help"" I didn't mean you!",BENDER
14677,BENDER,Don't mind me. I'm just saving you the trouble of throwing me away.,BENDER
14679,BENDER,I can't. I'm stuck in the can.,BENDER
14680,LEELA,"Well, ask Robot 1-X to pull you out.",LEELA
14682,LEELA,Why can't you accept his help.,LEELA
14684,LEELA,But he's just a tool to make your life easier. Like a socket wrench or a burglars kit.,LEELA
14685,BENDER,I can't ask for his help because...,BENDER
14687,BENDER,(whispering) I'm scared of him.,BENDER
14689,FARNSWORTH,Well then there's only one solution. You need an upgrade to make you compatible with Robot 1-X's new technology.,FARNSWORTH
14690,BENDER,"An upgrade? But I thought we all agreed I was perfect! Fry, didn't we agree I was perfect?",BENDER
14691,FRY,"Oh yeah, no, you're pretty perfect.",FRY
14692,BENDER,"Pretty perfect? So, you do think I need an upgrade.",BENDER
14693,FARNSWORTH,"Yes for God sakes, yes!",FARNSWORTH
14694,BENDER,(crying) Fine. I'll be back in a few days.,BENDER
14697,BENDER,"Yeah, right on nutcake!",BENDER
14699,BENDER,"W-W-Wait, what happened to your enthusiasm for stabbing them?",BENDER
14701,BENDER,It's like he's not him anymore.  You took away his robo-humanity!  I changed my mind!,BENDER
14702,BENDER,"I did it! I escaped! But to what kind of a life?  I'm too scared to get the upgrade but I can't face my friends again without it.  And so I set sail for unknown shores. Oh merciful Poseidon, take pitty on this mechanical mariner. Oh jeez!",BENDER
14703,BENDER,(shouting) Curse you merciful Poseideon!,BENDER
14704,BENDER,"Boy, what is this deal with the ocean? A tropical island huh? Well, I've washed up on worse places. OK, first up, I'm gonna need to build a shelter.  There. Well. I guess I'll go out for a while.",BENDER

14706,BENDER,"Oop, low on power!  Better fuel up! Oh no! Guess I'll do what I always do when I run out of booze.",BENDER
14707,BENDER,"Dont panic, I've got these yams. I'll just make some yam schnapps.",BENDER
14708,BENDER,Hey I should be mad at you! Now turn around.,BENDER
14711,BENDER,Who are you and why should I care?,BENDER
14713,BENDER,A working cartridge unit? Wow! You guys went obsolete years ago!,BENDER
14716,BENDER,Yeah but you have a choice.  What's your problem?,BENDER
14721,BENDER,"Look, no offence, but I need technology. Especially email and snowmobiles. And television! Without television how will I know what buzzwords are in?",BENDER
14723,BENDER,That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.,BENDER
14724,BENDER,Oh man he's never gonna make it over that next pebble...! Wait...wait...oh my God he made it!,BENDER
14727,BENDER,That was the greatest thing ever! Lets party!  Yeah baby c'mon!,BENDER
14729,BENDER,It's one of my ten desert island discs. I never even thought I'd get to use them. But look at me now. Ooh yeah baby! Do that thang!,BENDER
14731,BENDER,Which ocean? That ocean?,BENDER
14732,BENDER,Whoa! It's like the earth is making sweet salty love to itself while all the fish groove on it. So much for this garbage.  Take that Beethoven you deaf bastard!,BENDER
14733,BENDER,Bang bang bang. You sure got this life thing figured out cymbal banging monkey.,BENDER
14735,BENDER,Ooo! I'm gonna wash my linen so hard the w -  You-!  Wretched technology has brought me nothing but misery!,BENDER
14737,BENDER,Oh it's true. I am a hideous triumph of form and function.  But not for long!,BENDER
14738,BENDER [FROM HUT],"Oh, ow that hurt, oh...",BENDER
14740,BENDER,Behold my hand crafted purity. The modern world can bite my splintery wooden ass!,BENDER
14742,BENDER,Pft! Forget that. I say the whole world must learn of our peaceful ways. By force!,BENDER
14744,BENDER,We're going back to civilisation to wage war on technology!,BENDER
14746,BENDER,We'll soon stage an attack on technology worthy of being chronicled in an anthem by Rush!,BENDER
14748,BENDER,Mirrors reflecting mirrors? Hi-tech sorcery! Sorcery I say!,BENDER
14750,BENDER,"Yep, we're there. Prepare to surface!",BENDER
14751,BENDER,"And now, technology shall taste the lash of the hickory switch!",BENDER
14753,BENDER,"Whoa, whoa. No-one wants to count rocks more than me. But our mission is not complete. Not so long as Robot 1-X torments me with his obvious superiority. Ready the catapult Sinclair.  Aim for their power lines. The devil weans and electricity is his blood.",BENDER
14756,FARNSWORTH,(shouting) Oh! I'm blind!,FARNSWORTH
14757,LEELA,"Professor, we have no power.",LEELA
14758,FARNSWORTH,"What do you mean ""no power""? We're living in the future.",FARNSWORTH
14759,LEELA,I'd better light some candles.,LEELA
14760,BENDER,Friends. I've come to free you from your complicated lives. Free you from the complicated part I mean not the lives part.,BENDER
14761,LEELA,Oh Lord he's made of wood! What now Bender?,LEELA
14762,BENDER,"I got a downgrade! I'm a steam-powered wooden robot - just as nature intended. Therefore, I must kill Robot 1-X.",BENDER
14765,BENDER,I don't need your charity.  (shouting) Target Robot 1-X and fire!,BENDER
14766,FARNSWORTH,You wanged my ship you walnut panelled idiot!,FARNSWORTH
14767,BENDER,"(shouting) Try again Sinclair, I said target Robot 1-X!",BENDER
14770,LEELA,Great. Now we're being crushed.,LEELA
14772,BENDER,"Heck! Those guys hate fire! I gotta do something.  What the-? Termites? Well, I don't need legs to save my friends. I'll just use the old extentromatic arms!",BENDER
14774,BENDER,"I'm a comin'  Ow! Lousy primative body! Oh, why didn't I get that upgrade? I'm an outdated piece of junk!",BENDER
14776,BENDER,You shut up. No wait. I can use you as a tool to save my friends and I'll still be the hero who everyone says how great he was!,BENDER
14778,BENDER,Save my friends!  And Zoidberg!,BENDER
14781,BENDER,Down here.  I'm so sorry guys. I never meant to hurt you. Just to destroy everything you ever believed in.,BENDER
14782,LEELA,"Well, at least you saved us from, uh, you. Thank God you finally overcame your incompatibility with Robot 1-X.",LEELA
14783,BENDER,"Oh yeah, we were totally in sync! I was like ""Save them!"" and he was all ""No problem!"" and then he did it...",BENDER
14784,BENDER,...This new technology is great!  I love those magnificent 1-X robots. The 1-X robots are my friends!,BENDER
14786,BENDER,I'd like to give Robot 1-X a big smooch on the -  Hey! What's the dilly-o?,BENDER
14788,BENDER,But I destroyed the technology of the world. I ran on the beach and felt the sand between my foot cups.,BENDER
14790,BENDER,"Oof. If that stuff wasn't real, how can I be sure anything is real? Is it not possible, nay probable, that my whole life is just a product of my or someone else's imagination?",BENDER
14792,BENDER,"Well, I guess reality is what you make of it.  Oh, thanks baby!",BENDER
14805,BENDER,Cram a ham in it you twerps!  Sorry!,BENDER
14811,LEELA,Do you two have to imitate everything you see on TV?,LEELA
14817,FARNSWORTH,"Hmm, you didn't have a birth so technically, no.  Oh, don't feel bad. We can celebrate the day I extracted you from the cloning tank. Or the day I scraped that DNA from that growth on my back.",FARNSWORTH
14819,FARNSWORTH,Ah yes. It was 13 years ago next week. I used this very fork.,FARNSWORTH
14829,BENDER,Whoever's directing this is a master of suspense!,BENDER
14831,FRY,This show's been going downhill since season three.,FRY
14833,LEELA,Since when are you performing at children's parties?,LEELA
14837,FARNSWORTH,Well that doesn't mean that no one is coming and that you two are total losers. Who gave you that idea?,FARNSWORTH
14843,BENDER,"(gasping) Guys, guys something's happening on television again.",BENDER
14846,BENDER,An open casting call for child robots? Tinny Tim? Are you thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?,BENDER
14848,BENDER,"That I, Bender, am perfect for the role!",BENDER
14850,LEELA,"Bender, your swarthy Latin charm will only get you so far. There's a lot of famous child acting units here.",LEELA
14851,FRY,"Look, there's Macaulay Culckon.",FRY
14852,LEELA,He's just not cute since he got puberty installed.,LEELA
14853,FRY,Psst. There's that robot child actor who grew up an robbed a convenience store!,FRY
14854,LEELA,And there's that robot child actor who grew up and became a convenience store!,LEELA
14867,BENDER,(shouting) Boo! Not as good as Bender! Boo!,BENDER
14870,BENDER,"Once, when I took those hostages.",BENDER
14872,BENDER,Banditos eh? Aw this is great! 'Cause I happen to have a flawless Spanish accent!  (bad Spanish accent) I will say adios Padre! Come Jesus ye faithful. Tonight we eat...guacamole by the El Rio!,BENDER
14877,BENDER,Yo! I read the script and I think it would help my character's motivation if he was on fire.,BENDER
14879,BENDER,So now my character has a British accent?,BENDER
14881,BENDER,(muttering) Stupid dumb coma...coulda been British.,BENDER
14883,BENDER,(quietly) Permanent? That's completely out of character for Antonio. I'm gettin' up.,BENDER
14885,BENDER,"Hey everyone! Antonio here but you can call me ""Bender""! I got ants in my butt and I needs to strut.  C'mon baby! C'mon!",BENDER
14887,BENDER,"Bite my shiny metal ass!  Ooo yeah! C'mon baby, do that, oo yeah!",BENDER
14892,BENDER [ON TV],"Bite my shiny metal ass!  Ooo yeah! C'mon baby, c'mon yeah!",BENDER
14893,BENDER,Now that's hospital dancing.  Pretty good eh Calcky?,BENDER
14921,FARNSWORTH,The ruffians smoked one of your cigars.,FARNSWORTH
14924,FARNSWORTH,What? Such an act would be most uncomfortable for both of us! Where did you learn such language?,FARNSWORTH
14927,BENDER,"OK OK OK, get ready for this part.",BENDER
14934,FRY,Pft. What kind of bozos would start a Bender protest group?,FRY
14935,FARNSWORTH,Good news everyone. Hermes and I have started a Bender protest group.,FARNSWORTH
14938,FARNSWORTH,And for what? Some kind of cheap laugh? That's not what F-A-R-T is all about.,FARNSWORTH
14940,BENDER,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. You can't censor me just 'cause I'm an obscenely bad role model.",BENDER
14941,LEELA,"As unclean as it makes me feel, I agree with Bender. Kids don't turn rotten just from watching TV.",LEELA
14942,FRY,Yeah. Give a little credit to our public schools.,FRY
14954,FRY,Hey Bender.  Hey Bender.  Hey Bender. Hey Bender.,FRY
14955,FARNSWORTH,What's going on in here?  Oh. Now I'm really outraged.,FARNSWORTH
14959,FARNSWORTH,Hmm. There's something wrong with your story but I can't put my finger on it. Of course! You don't have friends!,FARNSWORTH
14962,FARNSWORTH,"Balderdash! I'll be the judge of who's cool, using the cool-o-meter!",FARNSWORTH
14964,FARNSWORTH,"Good Lord, I'm getting a reading of over 40 mega-Fonzies!",FARNSWORTH
14972,FARNSWORTH,I'll tell you what. Our boys have taken up stealing! One of the worst and coolest of crimes.,FARNSWORTH
14974,BENDER,Hey lay off me. TV would stink if everyone on it was a positive role model. Bender is about entertainment baby! You can't hold me responsible for what kids do when - hey! This is my stuff they stole! That's the last straw! Bender should not be allowed on television!,BENDER
14975,BENDER,Bender must be stopped. I've gone too far. Who does that guy think I am? C'mon! We're gonna march all the way to Hollywood and make them stop forcing their filthy me down our throats.,BENDER
14982,FARNSWORTH,Listen up Hollywood. We're an exciting new mob.,FARNSWORTH
14986,BENDER,We demand that all TVs be equipped with a v-chip that blocks Bender from appearing on the screen.,BENDER
14991,FARNSWORTH,There'll be no further nasty.  We still have the option of resorting to violence.,FARNSWORTH
14993,FARNSWORTH,I saw it on TV in that episode where Bender shot Calculon! How cool is that?,FARNSWORTH
14997,FARNSWORTH,I'm a cold blooded punk!,FARNSWORTH
14999,BENDER,"Hey look, the prop guy has a lamp!",BENDER
15004,BENDER,"Listen up, 'cause I've got a climactic speech! You, cameraman, keep the camera rolling. You, director, gimmie my motivation.",BENDER
15006,BENDER,"Perfect.  Viewers of the world, do smoking and drinking on TV really make me cool? Of course they do.  How 'bout committing crimes and violence? Again, the answer is ""yes."" But do we really want our kids exposed to that kind of trash on TV? I say absolutely not!  Uh...on the other hand, most - perhaps all the blame rests with the parents. That's right you!  And so I ask you this one question: Have you ever tried simply turning off the TV, sitting down with your children, and hitting them?",BENDER
15011,BENDER [ON TV],"...Have you ever tried simply turning off the TV, sitting down with your children, and hitting them?",BENDER
15014,FARNSWORTH,"Uh...that we should all take TV a little less seriously. And more importantly, turn it off once in a while.",FARNSWORTH
15019,FARNSWORTH,"Well, uh, that depends what's on.",FARNSWORTH
15021,FARNSWORTH,Ah let's just keep watching.,FARNSWORTH
15022,BENDER,(singing) TV party tonight!,BENDER
15024,BENDER,(singing) TV party tonight!,BENDER
15026,FRY,(singing) We've got nothing better to do...,FRY
15027,LEELA,(singing) ...Than watch TV and have a couple of brews!,LEELA
15029,FRY,(singing) We don't wanna know!,FRY
15030,FARNSWORTH,"(singing) We're dedicated, yes!",FARNSWORTH
15035,LEELA,Blernsmen at Blernsball!,LEELA
15038,BENDER,Huh?  I choose to not understand these signs.,BENDER
15040,FRY,Bender?? I was just not playing the holophonor.,FRY
15041,BENDER,Yeah well you should try not stinking at it.,BENDER
15042,FRY,I am trying. (ashamed) I've been taking lessons.,FRY
15043,BENDER,Lessons? Oh that's rich! Isn't it time you gave up all hope of ever improving yourself in any way?,BENDER
15044,FRY,"I know I should but I just can't. Remember when I had those stomach worms that made me smart? I could play the holophonor and it made Leela like me.  Hey Bender, as long as you know, I have a holophonor recital Tuesday and I'd really like to have somebody there. Please?",FRY
15045,BENDER,Fine I'll go already. Y'know sometimes I wish your real parents were still alive...not often.,BENDER
15047,FRY,Uh...hello Mrs Mellenger.,FRY
15049,BENDER,"I prefer the term ""love machine.""",BENDER
15050,BENDER,"Wow, your kid is great. How hard did you say you had to hit him?",BENDER
15052,FRY,The...Grumpy Snail.  Sorry.,FRY
15054,FRY,Ow! No! Quit it! Stop it!,FRY
15056,BENDER,Then good day madam!  We hope to see you soon for tea.,BENDER
15057,FRY,It's hopeless. I can hear all this great music in my head but my stupid hands can't keep up.,FRY
15058,BENDER,"Aww, you know what always cheers me up? Laughing at other people's misfortunes.",BENDER
15059,LEELA,"Hey guys, you missed a great delivery to Space Earth. Where you been all afternoon?",LEELA
15061,LEELA,Ooo was it jazz-noodling? My ex-boyfriend Sean played the sax. I used to listen for hours while he sat naked on my couch and improvised.,LEELA
15062,BENDER,So musicians really Rodger your Hammerstein huh?,BENDER
15063,LEELA,"Yeah, it's weird. Sean was uneducated, unambitious. He was pastey and hunched...",LEELA
15065,LEELA,"...But when he played I could sense this incredible, beautiful creative soul. Then one day I found someone else's couch fibres on his butt.",LEELA
15066,FRY,It could be my beautiful soul sitting naked on her couch if I could just learn to play this stupid thing.,FRY
15067,BENDER,"Oh but you can. Although you may have to metaphorically make a ""deal with the devil."" And by ""devil"" I mean ""Robot Devil."" And by ""metaphorically"" I mean ""get your coat.""",BENDER
15069,BENDER,"No, this isn't a religious visit. Fry just wants holophonor lessons.",BENDER
15070,FRY,Yep. I need to get really good without practicing.,FRY
15072,FRY,Sure it would.  Oh well. Goodbye.,FRY
15073,BENDER,"Fry you smelly idiot, I think he's willing to make some kind of deal with the devil with you.",BENDER
15074,FRY,"He is?  Great! Wait, what's the catch?",FRY
15076,FRY,I don't know. It doesn't seem entirely moral to -,FRY
15077,BENDER,Fry if you don't take this offer right now I will lose all respect for you and punch you.,BENDER
15078,FRY,Well...alright. You sure I probably won't know him?,FRY
15082,BENDER,I got a hundred bucks on Rectal-Exambot!,BENDER
15083,FRY,Robot Devil? I get your hands? Zam!,FRY
15085,BENDER,It's not ironic it's just coincidental. Now fork over those lady-fingers cookie!,BENDER
15087,FRY,Stop being such a baby and chop my hands off.,FRY
15089,FRY,(impressed) How'd you do that?,FRY
15091,FRY,At last! At last I have the power to make Leela love me.,FRY
15093,FRY,Check it out everyone. I'm back from hell and I've got the Robot Devil's hands!,FRY
15100,FRY,"Yeah, they get around! But I'm afraid we had a deal.",FRY
15109,FRY,"Thank you sir, that's exactly what I was going for.",FRY
15111,FRY,"But, I've never written an opera.",FRY
15113,FRY,But I wouldn't even know what to write about. Unless...  OK I'll do it. If I can make it about Leela.,FRY
15116,LEELA,Is it part of the opera?,LEELA
15117,FRY,Leela!  You shouldn't be listening. I-I don't want you to hear it 'til it's done.,FRY
15119,FRY,So's a peacock but you don't eat it 'til it's cooked. This has to be perfect. I want you to hear exactly what I hear when I think about you.,FRY
15120,LEELA,Oh Fry. All this time you've had this incredible gift and I never knew. I've been a fool. A fully justified prudent fool.  They're so cold.,LEELA
15123,BENDER,True but at least I don't have the hiccups anymore. What up?,BENDER
15125,BENDER,"Forget it, you can't tempt me.",BENDER
15127,BENDER,"Hm. I forgot you could tempt me with things I want.  Well, I suppose I've always wondered what it would be like to be more annoying.",BENDER
15129,BENDER,Grabby and Squeezy? Never! I love these guys!,BENDER
15131,BENDER,"No, nothing ain't gonna happen.",BENDER
15132,BENDER,Yes! With this built-in stadium airhorn I can really annoy people. And all it cost me was my crotchplate.,BENDER
15134,BENDER,"Yeah, that'll teach the first person I see a lesson!",BENDER
15136,LEELA,"Well, Fry's opera premiere's tomorrow night. I'm off to find a pair of formal gloves that'll fit over my enormous forearms.",LEELA
15137,BENDER,"Pretty annoying, huh Leela?",BENDER
15138,LEELA,(shouting) What? Are you talking? Oh God I'm deaf!,LEELA
15139,BENDER,Oops. I'm so so sorry Leela. I just wanted to annoy you.,BENDER
15140,LEELA,(shouting) What? Oh this is horrible. I won't be able to hear Fry's opera.,LEELA
15142,BENDER,"It's not ironic, it's just mean. Take this!",BENDER
15144,BENDER,Oh yeah? Well bite my shiny metal - (shouting) Oh nooo!,BENDER
15145,LEELA,"Nobody tell Fry I'm deaf. If he found out I couldn't hear his opera, it'd break his heart.",LEELA
15153,LEELA,"Amy, Fry's looking at me. What am s'posed to be feeling?  Ah!",LEELA
15155,BENDER,I don't recall ever fighting Godzilla but that is so what I would have done.,BENDER
15160,LEELA,"Half over? Oh, I'd give anything to hear the rest.",LEELA
15162,LEELA,"What? You can give me new ears? Wait, what seemingly reasonable thing do you want in return?",LEELA
15164,LEELA,"Whatever you said, forget it!",LEELA
15166,LEELA,Just...my left hand? Um...uh...,LEELA
15169,LEELA,I can't stand it!  OK. You can have my hand.,LEELA
15172,LEELA,"I can hear! I can hear like a safecracker! Hey, aren't you gonna take my hand?",LEELA

15203,FRY,My hands. My horrible human hands. And what did you do to my nails?,FRY
