<p>Young Elizabeth&#160;: [standing at the bow of a ship and singing]&#160;?We pillage, we plunder, we rifle and loot. Drink up me 'earties yo ho! We kidnap and ravage and don't give a hoot. Drink up me 'earties yo ho! Yo ho, yo ho a pirate's life for me. We extort, we pilfer, we filch and sack. Drink up&#160;? [ Gibbs puts his hand on her shoulder which surprises her]\
</p><p>Gibbs&#160;: Quiet, missy! Cursed pirates sail these waters. You don?t want to bring them down on us, now, do ya?\
</p><p>Norrington: Mr. Gibbs , that will do!\
</p><p>Gibbs&#160;: She was singing about pirates. Bad luck to be singing about pirates with us mired in this unnatural fog. Mark my words.\
</p><p>Norrington: Consider them marked. On your way.\
</p><p>Gibbs&#160;: Aye, Lieutenant. It?s bad luck to have a woman on board, too? even a miniature one.\
</p><p>Young Elizabeth&#160;: I think it?d be rather exciting to meet a pirate.\
</p><p>Norrington: Think again, Miss Swann . Vile and dissolute creatures, the lot of them. I intend to see to it that any man who sails under a pirate flag or wears a pirate brand gets what he deserves&#160;? a short drop and a sudden stop. [ Elizabeth glances at Gibbs who mimes a hanging]\
</p><p>Governor Swann&#160;: Lieutenant Norrington , I appreciate your fervor, but I?m, uh, I?m concerned about the effect this subject will have upon my daughter.\
</p><p>Norrington: My apologies, Governor Swann .\
</p><p>Young Elizabeth&#160;: Actually, I find it all fascinating.\
</p><p>Governor Swann&#160;: Yes. That?s what concerns me.\
</p><p>Young Elizabeth&#160;: [sees a parasol and then a piece of wreckage with a boy on it in the water] Look! A boy! There?s a boy in the water!\
</p><p>Norrington: Man overboard! Man the ropes. Fetch a Hook! Haul him aboard. [they get him on board] He?s still breathing.\
</p><p>Gibbs&#160;: [spots burning ship] Mary , Mother of God!\
</p><p>Governor Swann&#160;: What happened here?\
</p><p>Norrington: It?s most likely the powder magazine. Merchant vessels run heavily armed.\
</p><p>Gibbs&#160;: A lot of good it did them. Everyone?s thinking it. I?m just saying it. Pirates.\
</p><p>Governor Swann&#160;: There?s no proof of that. It was probably an accident.\
</p><p>Norrington: Rouse the Captain immediately! Heave to and take in sail. Launch the boats.\
</p><p>Sailor: Heave to!\
</p><p>Governor Swann&#160;: Elizabeth , I want you to accompany the boy. He?ll be in your charge. Take care of him. [she nods and walks over to the young Will ]\
</p><p>Young Elizabeth&#160;: [Will awakes, grabbing her wrist] It?s ok. My name?s Elizabeth Swann .\
</p><p>Young Will: W-W-Will Turner .\
</p><p>Young Elizabeth&#160;: I?m watching over you, Will . [ Will faints, she notices medallion and examines it] You?re a p-pirate. [hides it when Norrington approaches]\
</p><p>Norrington: Has he said anything?\
</p><p>Young Elizabeth&#160;: His name is William Turner . That?s all I found out.\
</p><p>Norrington: [to sailors] Take him below.\
</p><p>[ Elizabeth studies the medallion closer and upon looking up sees a ship with the black flag flying at its mast; she closes her eyes]\
</p><p>[End dream]\
</p><p>Scene 2: (A beautiful dress and an impressive sword)\
</p><p>[ Elizabeth awakes and decides to take out the medallion from a hiding place in her bureau drawer; she puts it on; there?s a knock on the door]\
</p><p>Governor Swann&#160;: Elizabeth&#160;? Are you alright? Are you decent?\
</p><p>Elizabeth&#160;: [hides medallion in the bodice of her nightgown, throws on a robe] Yes, yes!\
</p><p>Governor Swann&#160;: Still abed at this hour? [opens the curtains and the window] It?s a beautiful day. I have a gift for you. [reveals dress]\
</p><p>Elizabeth&#160;: Oh, it?s beautiful!\
</p><p>Governor Swann&#160;: Isn?t it?\
</p><p>Elizabeth&#160;: May I inquire as to the occasion?\
</p><p>Governor Swann&#160;: Does a father need an occasion to dote upon his daughter? [to the maids] Go on. Actually, I, um?I had hoped you might wear it for the ceremony today.\
</p><p>Elizabeth&#160;: The ceremony?\
</p><p>Governor Swann&#160;: Captain Norrington&#160;?s promotion ceremony.\
</p><p>Elizabeth&#160;: I knew it!\
</p><p>Governor Swann&#160;: Commodore Norrington, as he?s about to become! [the maids lace Elizabeth up into a corset]  A fine gentleman, don?t you think? He fancies you, you know. Elizabeth? How?s it coming?\
</p><p>Elizabeth&#160;: It?s difficult to say.\
</p><p>Governor Swann&#160;: I?m told it?s the latest fashion in London\
</p><p>Elizabeth&#160;: Well, women in London must?ve learned not to breathe.\
</p><p>Servant: Milord, you have a visitor.\
</p><p>[ Will studies a sconce and upon touching it, a piece comes off in his hand; he buries it in the vase that?s holding canes and umbrellas]\
</p><p>Governor Swann&#160;: [walks downstairs after the servant] Ah, Mr. Turner , good to see you again.\
</p><p>Will: Good day, sir. I have your order. [opens case and takes out the sword]\
</p><p>Governor Swann&#160;: [takes the sword and unsheathes it] Well.\
</p><p>Will&#160;: The blade is folded steel. That?s gold filigree laid into the handle. If I may. [balances the sword] Perfectly balanced. The tang is nearly the full width of the blade. [flips the sword and presents it gracefully to the Governor]\
</p><p>Governor Swann&#160;: [takes the sword] Impressive. Very impressive. Ah, now, Commodore Norrington is going to be very pleased with this. Do pass my compliments on to your Master. Hmm?\
</p><p>Will&#160;: I shall. A craftsman is always pleased to hear his work is appreciated.\
</p><p>Governor Swann&#160;: [enter Elizabeth ] Oh, Elizabeth , you look absolutely stunning.\
</p><p>Elizabeth&#160;: Will! It?s so good to see you. I had a dream about you last night.\
</p><p>Will&#160;: About me?\
</p><p>Governor Swann&#160;: Yes, well, is that entirely proper for you to??\
</p><p>Elizabeth&#160;: About the day we met, do you remember?\
</p><p>Will&#160;: How could I forget, Miss Swann&#160;?\
</p><p>Elizabeth&#160;: Will, how many times must I ask you to call me Elizabeth&#160;?\
</p><p>Will: At least once more, Miss Swann , as always.\
</p><p>Governor Swann&#160;: There. See? At least the boy has a sense of propriety. Now, we really must be going. [gives Elizabeth a parasol] There you are.\
</p><p>Elizabeth&#160;: Good day, Mr. Turner .\
</p><p>Governor Swann&#160;: Come along.\
</p><p>Will: Good day? [Elizabeth and the Governor exit, Will trailing after them, they leave in a carriage]&#160;? Elizabeth .\
</p><p>(We hear the soundtrack The Medallion Calls)\
</p><p>Scene 3: (A most excellent entrance, the debate, and the proposal)\
</p><p>[Jack stands on the mast of his boat, noticing that it?s filling up with water he jumps down to bail it out; notices three pirate skeletons hanging with a sign&#160;?pirates ye be warned? and pays homage to them; reaches the port, his boat sinking lower and lower until he is at the dock and is able to simply walk off the boat?s mast]\
</p><p>Harbormaster: [to Jack ] What&#160;? hey. Hold up, there, you. It?s a shilling to tie up your boat at the dock. [they both look at the sunken boat] And I shall need to know your name.\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: [hands him three shillings] What d?ye say to three shillings? and we forget the name?\
</p><p>Harbormaster: Welcome to Port Royal , Mr. Smith . [ Jack sees the Harbormasters money pouch and takes it]\
</p><p>[Norrington?s promotion ceremony] Shouted orders to soldiers: Two paces march! Right about face! Present arms! [Norrington walks to get his promotion, unsheathes his new sword]\
</p><p>Murtogg: [spots Jack ] This dock is <i>off limits</i> to civilians.\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: I?m terribly sorry. I <i>didn?t</i> know. If I see one, I shall inform you <i>immediately</i>. [tries to continue on his way but is again thwarted] Apparently there?s some sort of high toned and fancy to do up at the fort, eh? How could it be that two upstanding gentlemen such as yourselves did <i>not</i> merit an invitation?\
</p><p>Murtogg: <i>Someone</i> has to make sure this dock stays off limits to civilians.\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: It?s a fine goal - to be sure -  but it seems to me that a? [shifts again] a ship like <i>that</i> [points out the Dauntless] makes this one <i>here</i> a bit superfluous, really.\
</p><p>Murtogg: Oh, the Dauntless is the power in these waters, true enough, but there?s no ship as can match the <i>Interceptor</i> for speed.\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: I?ve heard of one, supposed to be very fast&#160;? nigh un-catchable?... the Black Pearl.\
</p><p>Mullroy: Well?there?s no <i>real</i> ship as can match the Interceptor.\
</p><p>Murtogg: The Black Pearl <i>is</i> a real ship.\
</p><p>Mullroy:  No, no it?s <i>not</i>.\
</p><p>Murtogg: Yes, it <i>is</i>, I?ve seen it.\
</p><p>Mullroy: You?ve <i>seen</i> it?\
</p><p>Murtogg: <i>Yes</i>.\
</p><p>Mullroy: You <i>haven?t</i> seen it.\
</p><p>Murtogg: Yes, I <i>have.</i>\
</p><p>Mullroy: You?ve seen a ship with black sails, that?s crewed by the damned and captained by a man so evil that Hell itself spat him back out?\
</p><p>Murtogg: No.\
</p><p>Mullroy: No.\
</p><p>Murtogg: But I <i>have</i> seen a ship with black sails. [ Jack slips away while they banter]\
</p><p>Mullroy: Oh, and no ship that?s not crewed by the damned and captained by a man so evil that Hell itself spat him back out could possibly have black sails therefore couldn?t possibly be any other ship than the Black Pearl. Is that what you?re saying?\
</p><p>Murtogg: [nods] No.\
</p><p>Mullroy: Like I said, there?s no <i>real</i> ship as can match the Interceptor? -  [notices Jack at the wheel of the Interceptor]\
</p><p>Murtogg: Hey! <i>You</i>! Get away from there.\
</p><p>Mullroy: You <i>don?t</i> have permission to be aboard there, mate.\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: I?m sorry, it?s just - it?s such a pretty boat. <i>Ship</i>.\
</p><p>Murtogg: What?s your name?\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: Smith. Or Smithy, if you like.\
</p><p>Mullroy: What?s your purpose in Port Royal , Mr. Smith&#160;?\
</p><p>Murtogg: Yeah. and no lies!\
</p><p>Jack: Well, then, I confess, it is my intention to commandeer one of these ships, pick up a crew in Tortuga,  raid, pillage, plunder and otherwise pilfer my weasely black guts out!\
</p><p>Murtogg: I said no lies!\
</p><p>Mullroy: I think he?s telling the truth.\
</p><p>Murtogg: If he were telling the truth, he wouldn?t have told us.\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: Unless, of course, he knew you wouldn?t believe the truth even if he told it to you.\
</p><p>[on the battlements of the Fort] Norrington: May I have a moment? [Elizabeth and Norrington step onto the platform. Elizabeth walks over to steady herself as she fans herself hastily and tries to catch her breath] Uh, you look lovely, Elizabeth. [Elizabeth still fanning herself chuckles softly and half-heartedly] I, uh, apologize if I seem forward, but I? must speak my mind. This promotion throws into sharp relief that which I have not yet achieved. Uh? a marriage to a fine woman. You have become a fine woman, Elizabeth.\
</p><p>Elizabeth&#160;: I can?t breathe.\
</p><p>Norrington: Yes, I? I?m a bit nervous myself. [she falls over battlement]\
</p><p>Scene 4: (The daring rescue and escape)\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: [in boat with guards]&#160;?and then they made me their chief.\
</p><p>Norrington: Elizabeth&#160;? Elizabeth&#160;! My God.[makes to jump in after her]\
</p><p>Gillette&#160;: [stops him] The rocks! Sir, it?s a miracle she missed them.\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: Will you be saving her then?\
</p><p>Mullroy: I can?t swim.\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: [glances at Murtogg who stares back at him] Pride of the King?s Navy you are. [hands the guards his effects] Do not lose these. [dives in to save her]\
</p><p>Murtogg: [the medallion calls to the Black Pearl ] What was that? [helps Jack with Elizabeth ] Ooh, I got her. She?s not breathing!\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: Move! [shoves him aside, cuts open corset and Elizabeth spits out water and gasps for breath]\
</p><p>Mullroy: Never would?ve thought of that.\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: Clearly you?ve never been to Singapore . [sees medallion, to Elizabeth ] Where did you get that?\
</p><p>Norrington: [to Jack , pointing his sword at him] On your feet.\
</p><p>Governor Swann&#160;: [helps Elizabeth up] Elizabeth . Are you alright?\
</p><p>Elizabeth&#160;: Yes, I?m fine.\
</p><p>Governor Swann&#160;: [sees Murtogg holding Elizabeth 's corset; Murtogg points at Jack&#160;; Swann looks over at Jack ] Shoot him!\
</p><p>Elizabeth&#160;: Father! Commodore, do you really intend to kill my rescuer? \
</p><p>Norrington: I believe thanks are in order. [offers his hand to shake; reveals&#160;?P? for pirate] Had a brush with the East India Trading company, did we, pirate?\
</p><p>Governor Swann&#160;: Hang him.\
</p><p>Norrington: Keep your guns on him, men. Gillette , fetch some irons. [sees tattoo of a sparrow in flight] Well, well? Jack Sparrow , isn?t it?\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: Captain Jack Sparrow , if you please, sir.\
</p><p>Norrington: Well, I don?t see your ship?Captain.\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: I?m in the market as it were.\
</p><p>Murtogg: He said he?d come to commandeer one.\
</p><p>Mullroy: Told ya he was telling the truth. These are his, sir. [hands him Jack&#160;?s effects]\
</p><p>Norrington: No additional shots nor powder. A compass that doesn?t point north. [unsheathes sword] And I half expected it to be made of wood. You are without doubt the worst pirate I?ve ever heard of.\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: But you have heard of me. [is pulled along to be put in chains]\
</p><p>Elizabeth&#160;: Commodore, I really must protest.\
</p><p>Norrington: Carefully, Lieutenant.\
</p><p>Elizabeth&#160;: Pirate or not this man saved my life.\
</p><p>Norrington: One good deed is not enough to redeem a man of a lifetime of wickedness.\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: Though it seems enough to condemn him.\
</p><p>Norrington: Indeed. [ Gillette moves away from Jack ]\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: Finally. [throws his irons around Elizabeth&#160;?s neck]\
</p><p>Governor Swann&#160;: No, don?t shoot!\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: I knew you?d warm up to me. Commodore Norrington, my effects, please, and my hat. Commodore! Elizabeth . It is Elizabeth isn?t it?\
</p><p>Elizabeth&#160;: It?s Miss Swann .\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: Miss Swann , if you?d be so kind. Come, come, dear. We don?t have all day. Now if you?d be very kind. [she straps on his sword, puts on his hat, etc.] Easy on the goods, darling.\
</p><p>Elizabeth&#160;: You?re despicable.\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: Sticks and stones, love. I saved your life, you save mine, we?re square. Gentlemen, m?lady, you will always remember this as the day that you almost caught Captain Jack Sparrow&#160;! [pushes Elizabeth away and escapes, swinging around and landing on a beam above their heads]\
</p><p>Governor Swann&#160;: Now, will you shoot him?\
</p><p>Norrington: Open fire! [ Jack is shot at]  On his heels. [ Jack throws his chains about a rope and slides down to the ground] Gillette , Mr. Sparrow has a dawn appointment with the gallows. I would hate for him to miss it.\
</p><p>Soldier: [the soldiers run around searching for Jack ] Search upstairs. Look lively, men.\
</p><p>Scene 5: (The duel between Jack and Will )\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: [enters smithy, sees drunk and sleeping Mr. Brown and pokes him to see if he?ll awaken] Whoa! [tries to get rid of the irons with a hammer but it doesn?t work; uses the red hot end of a metal rod to spur the donkey; succeeds in breaking the link between them by putting them on two turning wheels in the machinery powered by the donkey; hides when Will enters]\
</p><p>Will&#160;: [calms the donkey; sees Brown ] Right where I left you. [sees hammer] Not where I left you. [notices Jack&#160;?s hat and reaches for it; enter Jack with sword unsheathed] You're the one they're hunting. The pirate.\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: You seem somewhat familiar. Have I threatened you before?\
</p><p>Will&#160;: I make a point of avoiding familiarity with pirates.\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: Ah, well, then it would be a shame to put a black mark on your record. So, if you'll excuse me? [turns away and is about to leave when Will gets his own sword] Do you think this wise, boy&#160;? crossing blades with a pirate?\
</p><p>Will&#160;: You threatened Miss Swann .\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: Only a little. [they parry] You know what you?re doing. I?ll give you that. Excellent form. But how?s your footwork? If I step here; [he steps] very good. Now I step again. Ta. [sheathes sword and walks to the door; Will throws sword which gets stuck in the door, barring the exit; Jack tries to pull it out but is unsuccessful] That is a wonderful trick? except, once again you are between me and my way out. And now you have no weapon. [ Will takes out a sword with a heated tip; they fight] Who makes all these? [looks pointedly at swords]\
</p><p>Will&#160;: I do! And I practice with them? three hours a day!\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: You need to find yourself a girl, mate! Or perhaps the reason you practice three hours a day is that you already found one and are otherwise incapable of wooing said strumpet. You're not a eunuch, are you? [looks down]\
</p><p>Will&#160;: I practice three hours a day so that when I meet a pirate, I can kill it! [they continue their swordfight jumping onto a cart that sways under them; Will hooks a knife in the irons hanging from Jack?s left wrist and throws it up so it is embedded in the beam above, in return Jack hits a loose board which throws Will off the cart; Jack uses his body weight to get the knife out of the wood and falls back on the cart just as Will climbed back on; Will is thrown up into the rafters and cuts free a heavy sack which vaults Jack up into the rafters as well; they fight, jumping from beam to beam; Jack loses his weapon and blinds Will with sand; takes out his pistol while Will protects his eyes] You cheated!\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: Pirate! [hears men trying to break the door down] Move away.\
</p><p>Will: No.\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: <i>Please</i> move.\
</p><p>Will: No! I <i>cannot</i> just step aside and let you escape.\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: (cocks his weapon) This shot is <i>not</i> meant for you. [gets hit on the head with a bottle of alcohol and falls unconscious]\
</p><p>Soldier: [Norrington?s men break in the door] There he is. Over here.\
</p><p>Norrington: Excellent work, Mr. Brown . You?ve assisted in the capture of a dangerous fugitive.\
</p><p>Mr. Brown&#160;: Just doing my <i>civic duty</i>, sir.\
</p><p>Norrington: Well, I trust you will always remember this as the day that Captain Jack Sparrow <i>almost</i> escaped. Take him away.\
</p><p>Scene 6: (Talk of the right match and Port Royal under attack!)\
</p><p>Prisoners: [whistling and waving a bone to a dog that has the keys to the prison in its jaws] Come here, boy. Want a nice juicy bone? Come here. Come on \
</p><p>Jack&#160;: You can keep doing that forever, the dog is never going to move.\
</p><p>Prisoner: Oh, excuse us if we haven't resigned ourselves to the gallows just yet.\
</p><p>[in the Governor?s house; Elisabeth&#160;?s room] Estrella: There you go, Miss. [puts a bed warmer between the sheets] It was a difficult day for you, I?m sure.\
</p><p>Elizabeth&#160;: I suspected Commodore Norrington would propose but I must admit, I wasn?t entirely prepared for it.\
</p><p>Estrella: Well, I meant you being threatened by that pirate. Sounds terrifying.\
</p><p>Elizabeth&#160;: Oh, yes, it was terrifying.\
</p><p>Estrella: But the Commodore proposed. Fancy that. Now, that?s a smart match, Miss, if it?s not too bold to say.\
</p><p>Elizabeth&#160;: It is a smart match. He?s a fine man; he?s what any woman should dream of marrying.\
</p><p>Estrella: Well, that Will Turner , he?s a fine man, too.\
</p><p>Elizabeth&#160;: That is too bold.\
</p><p>Estrella: Well, begging your pardon, Miss. It was not my place. [leaves]\
</p><p>[meanwhile Will is hammering a new sword, he looks out unto the deserted street]\
</p><p>[on top of the Fort] Governor Swann&#160;: Has my daughter given you an answer yet?\
</p><p>Norrington: No, she hasn?t.\
</p><p>Governor Swann&#160;: Well, she has had a very trying day. Ghastly weather, don?t you think?\
</p><p>Norrington: Bleak. Very bleak.\
</p><p>Governor Swann&#160;: What?s that?\
</p><p>Norrington: Cannon fire! [tackles the Governor] Return fire!\
</p><p>[in the jail] Jack&#160;: I know those guns. [looks out of his little window] It?s the Pearl .\
</p><p>Prisoner: The Black Pearl&#160;? I?ve heard stories. She?s been preying on ships and settlements for near ten years. Never leaves any survivors.\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: No survivors? Then where do the stories come from, I wonder?\
</p><p>[the Black Pearl?s guns are destroying the battlements, the pirates are now coming ashore in boats; Will takes up a sword, a hatchet, and a knife to fight the invading pirates; on the battlements;saves a maid by killing a pirate with his hatchet]\

</pre>\
<p>Soldier: Aim for the flashes!\

</p><p>Elizabeth&#160;: What?\
</p><p>Estrella: You?re the Governor?s daughter.\
</p><p>Elizabeth&#160;: They haven?t seen you. Hide, and the first chance you get, run to the fort. [distracts Ragetti and Pintel as the maid runs out, hits Pintel in the face with the bed warmer]\
</p><p>Ragetti: Gotcha! [catches Elizabeth and she releases ashes onto his head] It?s hot! You burned me!\
</p><p>Pintel: [to Ragetti] Come on! [Estrella escapes; Elizabeth is cornered on the stairs and while pirates are distracted by one of their own being taken out by a cannon she runs away; Pintel and Ragetti are stopped by a falling chandelier and Elizabeth locks the door and then tries to get a sword out but is unable; Pintel and Ragetti break the door] We know you?re here, Poppet.\
</p><p>Ragetti: Poppet.\
</p><p>Pintel: Come out? and we promise we won?t hurt you. [Ragetti looks at Pintel questioningly who only smiles] We will find you, Poppet. You?ve got something of ours, and it calls to us. The gold calls to us.\
</p><p>Ragetti: Gold calls?\
</p><p>Pintel: [opens door of the closet]&#160;?Ello, Poppet.\
</p><p>Elizabeth&#160;: Parley!\
</p><p>Ragetti: What?\
</p><p>Elizabeth&#160;: Parley. I invoke the right of parley. According to the Code of the brethren, set down by the pirates Morgan and Bartholomew , you have to take me to your Captain.\
</p><p>Pintel: I know the code.\
</p><p>Elizabeth&#160;: If an adversary demands parley you can do them no harm until the parley is complete.\

</p><p>Twigg: [spits] Last time I saw you, you were all alone on a godforsaken island, shrinking into the distance. His fortunes aren?t improved much.\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: Worry about your own fortunes, gentlemen. The deepest circle of Hell is reserved for betrayers and mutineers. [Koehler grabs Jack&#160;?s throat; Jack sees skeletal arm] So there is a curse. That?s interesting.\

</p><p>Elizabeth&#160;: I want you to leave and never come back.\
</p><p>Barbossa: I?m disinclined to acquiesce to your request. Means&#160;?no.?\
</p><p>Elizabeth&#160;: Very well. I?ll drop it. [dangles medallion over the sea]\
</p><p>Barbossa: Me holds are burstin' with swag. That bit of shine matters to us? Why?\
</p><p>Elizabeth&#160;: It?s what you?ve been searching for. I recognized the ship. I saw it eight years ago on the crossing from England .\
</p><p>Barbossa: Did ya, now?\
</p><p>Elizabeth&#160;: Fine. Well, I suppose if it is worthless then there?s no point in me keeping it. [it drops a bit, the pirates lunge forward]\
</p><p>Barbossa: Ah. [chuckles] You have a name, Missy?\
</p><p>Elizabeth&#160;: Elizabeth&#160;?Turner. I?m a maid in the Governor?s household.  [she curtsies]\
</p><p>Barbossa: Miss Turner&#160;??\
</p><p>Pintel: Bootstrap.\
</p><p>Barbossa: And how does a maid come to own a trinket such as that. Family heirloom, perhaps?\
</p><p>Elizabeth&#160;: I didn?t steal it, if that?s what you mean.\
</p><p>Barbossa: Very well, you hand it over and we?ll put your town to our rudder and ne?er return.\
</p><p>Elizabeth&#160;: [she hands it over] Our bargain? [Barbossa walks away from her]\
</p><p>Bo?sun&#160;: Still the guns and stow&#160;?em, Signal the men, set the flags and make good to clear port.\
</p><p>Elizabeth&#160;: Wait! You have to take me to shore. According to the Code of the Order of the Brethren -\
</p><p>Barbossa: First, your return to shore was not part of our negotiations nor our agreement so I must do nothing. And secondly, you must be a pirate for the pirate?s code to apply and you?re not. And thirdly, the code is more what you'd call 'guidelines' than actual rules. Welcome aboard the Black Pearl , Miss Turner .\
</p><p>Scene 8: (To save Elizabeth and Jack&#160;?s rescue)\
</p><p>Will&#160;: [awakes on the street in the morning; to Norrington] They?ve taken her. They?ve taken Elizabeth .\
</p><p>Norrington: Mr. Murtogg , remove this man.\
</p><p>Will&#160;: We <i>have</i> to hunt them down. we must save her.\
</p><p>Governor Swann&#160;: And <i>where</i> do you propose we start? If you have <i>any</i> information concerning my daughter, <i>please</i> share it.\
</p><p>Murtogg: That Jack Sparrow . He talked about the Black Pearl.\
</p><p>Mullroy: Mentioned it, is more what he did.\
</p><p>Will&#160;: Ask him where it is. Make a deal with him. He could lead us to it.\
</p><p>Norrington: No?the pirates who invaded this Fort left Sparrow locked in his cell ergo they are not his allies. Governor, we will establish their most likely course?\
</p><p>Will&#160;: [buries hatchet in the table] That?s <i>not</i> good enough!\
</p><p>Norrington: Mr. Turner , you are not a military man, you are not a sailor. You are a <i>blacksmith</i> and this is <i>not</i> the moment for rash actions. (whispers to Will) Do NOT make the mistake of thinking you are the ONLY man here who cares for Elizabeth . [hands him back his hatchet]\
</p><p>[in jail] Jack&#160;: [trying to pick the lock with a bone] Please.... [hears footsteps, leaves the bone in the lock and lies down]\
</p><p>Will: You. Sparrow!\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: Aye.\
</p><p>Will&#160;: You are familiar with that ship&#160;? the Black Pearl?\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: I?ve <i>heard</i> of it.\
</p><p>Will&#160;: Where does it make berth?\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: <i>Where does it make berth</i>? Have you <i>not</i> heard the stories? Captain Barbossa and his crew of miscreants sail from the dreaded Isla de Muerta . It?s an island that <i>cannot</i> be found except by those who already know where it is.\
</p><p>Will&#160;: The ship?s real enough. Therefore its anchorage must be a real place. Where is it?\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: [studies his nails] Why ask <i>me</i>?\
</p><p>Will&#160;: Because you?re a pirate.\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: And <i>you</i> want to turn pirate yourself, is that it?\
</p><p>Will&#160;: Never! (he relents) They took Miss Swann .\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: Oh, so it is that you?ve found a girl. I see. Well, if you?re intending to brave all, hasten to her rescue and so win fair lady?s heart you?ll have to do it alone, mate. I see <i>no</i> profit in it for me.\
</p><p>Will&#160;: I can get you out of here.\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: How?s that? The key?s run off.\
</p><p>Will&#160;: I helped build these cells. These are half pin-barrel hinges. [picks up a bench and places it at the bottom of the cell door] With the right leverage and the proper application of strength? the door will lift free.\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: What?s your name?\
</p><p>Will: Will Turner .\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: That will be short for William , I imagine. Good, strong name. No doubt, named for your father, eh?\
</p><p>Will: Yes.\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: Uh-huh. Well, Mr. Turner , I?ve changed me mind. If you spring me from this cell I swear on pain of death I shall take you to the Black Pearl and your bonny lass. Do we have an accord?\
</p><p>Will&#160;: [they shake hands] Agreed.\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: Agreed. Get me out.\
</p><p>Will&#160;: [lifts the door free] Hurry. Someone will have heard that.\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: Not without my effects.\
</p><p>Scene 9: (Commandeering a ship)\
</p><p>Will&#160;: We?re going to steal the ship. That ship? [glances at the Dauntless]\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: Commandeer. We?re going to commandeer that ship. Nautical term. One question about your business, boy, or there?s no use going. This girl&#160;? how far are you willing to go to save her?\
</p><p>Will&#160;: I?d die for her.\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: Oh, good. No worries, then.\
</p><p>Will&#160;: [under boat underwater with Jack in the lead] This is either madness or brilliance.\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: It?s remarkable how often those two traits coincide. [they board the Dauntless] Everyone stay calm! we are taking over the ship.\
</p><p>Will: Aye! Avast! [the men laugh]\
</p><p>Gillette&#160;: This ship cannot be crewed by two men. You?ll never make it out of the bay.\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: [points his pistol at Gillette&#160;?s nose] Son?I?m Captain Jack Sparrow. Savvy?\
</p><p>Groves&#160;: [notices Gillette and his men a small boat] Commodore!\
</p><p>Gillette&#160;: [waving and screaming from the boat] Sir, they?ve taken the Dauntless. They?ve taken the ship. Sparrow and Turner - they?ve taken the Dauntless.\
</p><p>Norrington: [sees the two on board the ship through his spy glass] Rash, Turner, too rash. That is without doubt the worst pirate I have ever seen.\
</p><p>Will&#160;: [notices the Interceptor set sail] Here they come.\
</p><p>Gillette&#160;: [to his crew about the boat] Bring her around! Bring her around!\
</p><p>Norrington: [he and his men board the Dauntless] Search every cabin, every hold, down to the bilges. [ Jack and Will swing onto the Interceptor and sail away; Norrington notices] Sailors, back to the Interceptor! Now!\
</p><p>Sailor: Quickly men! [they try but are too late]\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: Thank you, Commodore, for getting us ready to make way. We?d have had a hard time of it by ourselves.\
</p><p>Norrington: Set top sails and clear up this mess.\
</p><p>Groves&#160;: With the wind at quarter astern, we won?t catch them.\
</p><p>Norrington: We don?t need to catch them just get them in range of the long nines.\
</p><p>Groves&#160;: Hands, come about. Run out the guns. [to Norrington] We open fire on our own ship, sir?\
</p><p>Norrington: I?d rather see her at the bottom of the ocean than in the hands of a pirate.\
</p><p>Sailor: Commodore, he?s disabled the rudder chain, sir!\
</p><p>Gillette&#160;: [the Interceptor bears down on his boat] Abandon ship! [they jump off just in time as the boat is broken up and sinks under the Interceptor]\
</p><p>Groves&#160;: That?s got to be the best pirate I?ve ever seen.\
</p><p>Norrington: So it would seem.\
</p><p>Scene 10: (Revelations and Tortuga )\
</p><p>Will&#160;: [sharpening his sword] When I was a lad living in England , my mother raised me by herself. After she died, I came out here, looking for my father.\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: Is that so?\
</p><p>Will: My father, Will Turner . At the jail, it was only after you learned my name that you agreed to help. Since that?s what I wanted, I didn?t press the matter. I?m not a simpleton, Jack. You knew my father.\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: I knew&#160;?im. Probably one the few who knew him as William Turner . Everyone else just called him Bootstrap or Bootstrap Bill.\
</p><p>Will: Bootstrap?\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: Good man. Good pirate. I swear you look just like him.\
</p><p>Will&#160;: It?s not true. He was a merchant sailor. A good, respectable man who obeyed the law.\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: He was a bloody pirate, a scallywag.\
</p><p>Will&#160;: My father was not a pirate. [takes out his sword]\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: Put it away, son. It?s not worth you getting beat again.\
</p><p>Will&#160;: You didn?t beat me. you ignored the rules of engagement. In a fair fight, I?d killed you.\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: Then that's not much incentive for me to fight fair, then, is it?  [moves one of the sails so that the yard catches Will and swings him out over the sea] Now, as long as you?re just hanging there, pay attention. The only rules that really matter are these&#160;? what a man can do and what a man can?t do. For instance, you can accept that your father was a pirate and a good man or you can?t. But pirate is in your blood, boy, so you?ll have to square with that someday. Now, me, for example, I can let you drown but I can?t bring this ship into Tortuga all by me onesy, savvy? So? [swings him back on board and offers him his sword] can you sail under the command of a pirate? Or can you not?\
</p><p>Will&#160;: [takes the sword] Tortuga&#160;?\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: Tortuga . [on the island] More importantly, it is indeed a sad life that has never breathed deep this sweet, proliferous bouquet that is Tortuga , savvy? What do you think?\
</p><p>Will&#160;: It'll linger.\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: I?ll tell you mate, if every town in the world were like this one, no man would ever feel unwanted.\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: Scarlett&#160;! [she slaps him] Not sure I deserved that. Giselle! \
</p><p>Giselle: Who was she?! \
</p><p>Jack&#160;: What? [she slaps him] I may have deserved that. \
</p><p>Scene 11: (A proposition)\
</p><p>Gibbs&#160;: [ Jack throws a bucket of water at him] Curse you for breathing, you slack-jawed idiot! Mother?s love! Jack&#160;! You should know better than to wake a man when he?s sleeping.&#160;?S bad luck.\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: Ah, fortunately I know how to counter it. The man who did the waking buys, the man who was sleeping, a drink. The man who was sleeping drinks it while listening to a proposition from the man who did the waking.\
</p><p>Gibbs&#160;: Aye, that'll about do it. [ Will throws another bucket of water at him] Blast! I?m already awake!\
</p><p>Will&#160;: That was for the smell.\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: [they enter a tavern; to Will ] Keep a sharp eye. [sits at a table with Gibbs ]\
</p><p>Gibbs&#160;: Now, what?s the nature of this venture of yourn?\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: I?m going after the Black Pearl. [ Gibbs almost chokes on his drink] I know where it?s going to be, and I?m going to take it.\
</p><p>Gibbs&#160;: Jack , it?s a fool?s errand. Why, you know better than me the tales of the Black Pearl.\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: That?s why I know what Barbossa is up to. All I need is a crew.\
</p><p>Gibbs&#160;: From what I hear tell of Captain Barbossa , he?s not a man to suffer fools, nor strike a bargain with one.\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: Well, then I?d say it?s a very good thing I?m not a fool then, eh?\
</p><p>Gibbs&#160;: Prove me wrong. What makes ye think Barbossa will give up his ship to you?\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: Let?s just say it?s a matter of leverage, eh? [nods at Will ]\
</p><p>Gibbs&#160;: The kid?\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: That is the child of Bootstrap Bill Turner. His only child, savvy?\
</p><p>Gibbs&#160;: Is he, now?? Leverage,? says you.&#160;?I think I feel a change in the wind,? says I. I?ll find us a crew. There?s bound to be some sailors on this rock crazy as you.\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: One can only hope. Take what you can? [toasts Gibbs ]\
</p><p>Gibbs&#160;: [they clink their tankards]&#160;?Give nothing back. [drain their drinks]\
</p><p>Scene 12: (The origin of the curse)\
</p><p>Pintel: You'll be dinin' with the captain. And he requests you wear this. [gives her a dress]\
</p><p>Elizabeth&#160;: Well, you may tell the captain that I am disinclined to acquiesce to his request.\
</p><p>Pintel: He said you?d say that. He also said if that be the case, you'll be dinin' with the crew?and you'll be naked. [she snatches the dress] Fine. \
</p><p>[in the Captain?s cabin, the food is laid out] Barbossa: [ Elizabeth eats daintily] There?s no need to stand on ceremony, nor call to impress anyone. You must be hungry. [gives her a goblet with wine] Try the wine. And the apples? [offers her one] One of those next.\
</p><p>Elizabeth&#160;: It?s poisoned.\
</p><p>Barbossa: There would be no sense to be killing ye, Miss Turner .\
</p><p>Elizabeth&#160;: Then release me, you have your trinket; I?m of no further value to you.\
</p><p>Barbossa: [takes out the medallion] You don?t know what this is, do ye?\
</p><p>Elizabeth&#160;: It?s a pirate medallion.\
</p><p>Barbossa: This is Aztec gold? one of 882 identical pieces they delivered in a stone chest to Cort�s himself. Blood money paid to stem the slaughter he wreaked upon them with his armies. But the greed of Cort�s was insatiable. So the heathen gods placed upon the gold?a terrible curse. Any mortal that removes but a single piece from that stone chest shall be punished for eternity.\
</p><p>Elizabeth&#160;: I hardly believe in ghost stories anymore, Captain Barbossa .\
</p><p>Barbossa: Aye. That?s exactly what I thought when we were first told the tale. Buried on an Island of Dead what cannot be found except for those who know where it is. Find it, we did. There be the chest. Inside be the gold. And we took&#160;?em all. We spent&#160;?em and traded&#160;?em and frittered&#160;?em away on drink and food and pleasurable company. The more we gave&#160;?em away, the more we came to realize?the drink would not satisfy, food turned to ash in our mouths, and all the pleasurable company in the world could not slake our lust. We are cursed men, Miss Turner . Compelled by greed, we were, but now we are consumed by it. [ Elizabeth takes a butter knife and hides it] There is one way we can end our curse. All the scattered pieces of the Aztec gold must be restored and the blood repaid. Thanks to ye, we have the final piece.\
</p><p>Elizabeth&#160;: And the blood to be repaid?\
</p><p>Barbossa: That?s why there?s no sense to be killin? ye?yet. [offers her an apple] Apple? Arr. [she stabs him with the knife; he takes it out] I?m curious&#160;? after killin? me what was it you plannin? on doing next? [she runs out and sees the pirates, all decaying skeletons] Look! The moonlight shows us for what we really are. We are not among the living, and so we cannot die, but neither are we dead. For too long I?ve been parched with thirst and unable to quench it. Too long I?ve been starving to death and haven?t died. I feel nothing&#160;? not the wind on my face nor the spray of the sea, nor the warmth of a woman?s flesh. [walks out into the moonlight and reveals a skeleton] You best start believing in ghost stories Miss Turner . You?re in one! [drinks and it pours over his ribs, laughs and the crew laughs with him] What are ye looking at? Back to work!\
</p><p>Pirates: You heard the Captain. Back to work.\
</p><p>Scene 13: ( Jack&#160;?s crew)\
</p><p>Gibbs&#160;: Feast your eyes, Captain. All of them, faithful hands before the mast, every man worth his salt. And crazy to boot.\
</p><p>Will&#160;: So this is your able-bodied crew?\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: You, sailor!\
</p><p>Gibbs&#160;: Cotton, sir. \
</p><p>Jack&#160;: Mr. Cotton&#160;? do you have the courage and fortitude to follow orders and stay true in the face of danger and almost certain death? Mr. Cotton&#160;! Answer, man!\
</p><p>Gibbs&#160;: He's a mute, sir. Poor devil had his tongue cut out, so he trained the parrot to talk for him. No one?s yet figured how.\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: Mr. Cotton 's... parrot. Same question.\
</p><p>Parrot: Wind in the sails! Wind in the sails!\
</p><p>Gibbs&#160;: Mostly, we figure, that means&#160;?yes.'?\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: O?course it does. [to Will ] Satisfied?\
</p><p>Will&#160;: Well, you?ve proved they?re mad.\
</p><p>Anamaria: And what?s the benefit for us?\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: [comes over to the voice and takes off the sailors hat, revealing a woman] Anamaria. [she slaps him]\
</p><p>Will&#160;: I suppose you didn?t deserve that one either.\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: No, that one I deserved.\
</p><p>Anamaria: You stole my boat!\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: Actually - [she slaps him again] borrowed. Borrowed without permission. But with every intention of bringing it back to you.\
</p><p>Anamaria: But you didn?t!\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: You?ll get another one.\
</p><p>Anamaria: [points her forefinger at him] I will.\
</p><p>Will: A better one.\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: A better one!\
</p><p>Will: That one. [points to the Interceptor]\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: What one? That one?! Aye, that one. What say you?\
</p><p>Crew: Aye!\
</p><p>Cotton?s Parrot: Anchors aweigh.\
</p><p>Gibbs&#160;: No, no, no, no, no, it?s frightful bad luck to bring a woman aboard, sir.\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: It?d be far worse not to have her.\
</p><p>[a storm breaks upon them at sea] Will&#160;: How can we sail to an island that nobody can find with a compass that doesn?t work?\
</p><p>Gibbs&#160;: Aye, the compass doesn?t point north but we?re not trying to find north, are we? [to Jack ] We should drop canvas, sir.\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: She can hold a bit longer.\
</p><p>Gibbs&#160;: What?s in your head that?s put you in such a fine mood, Captain?\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: We?re catching up.\
</p><p>Scene 14: ( Jack&#160;?s past revealed)\
</p><p>[on the Pearl ] Pintel: Time to go, Poppet. [Barbossa latches the medallion around Elizabeth&#160;?s neck and they all sail to the cave]\
</p><p>Parrot: [singing as they enter a lagoon] Dead men tell no tales.\
</p><p>Gibbs&#160;: [the whole crew is looking at the wrecks strewn everywhere in the water] Puts a chill in the bones how many honest sailors have been claimed by this passage.\
</p><p>Will&#160;: [watches as Jack closes the compass when Cotton stares at him too much] How is it that Jack came by that compass?\
</p><p>Gibbs&#160;: Not a lot?s known about Jack Sparrow before he showed up in Tortuga with a mind to go after the treasure of the Isla de Muerta . That was before I met him, back when he was Captain of the Black Pearl.\
</p><p>Will: What? He failed to mention that.\
</p><p>Gibbs&#160;: Well, he plays things closer to the vest now. And a hard-learned lesson it was. See three days out on the venture the first mate comes to him and says everything?s an equal share. That should mean the location of the treasure, too, so Jack gives up the bearings. That night there was a mutiny. They marooned Jack on an island and left him to die but not before he?d gone mad with the heat.\
</p><p>Will&#160;: Ah. So that's the reason for all the? [acts like Jack ] \
</p><p>Gibbs&#160;: Reason's got nothing to do with it. Now Will , when a man is marooned he is a given a pistol with a single shot&#160;? one shot. Well it won't do much good hunting or to be rescued. But after three weeks of a starvin? belly and thirst, that pistol will start to look real friendly. But Jack&#160;? he escaped the island, and he still has that one shot. Oh, but he won't use it, though, save for one man. His mutinous first mate.\
</p><p>Will: Barbossa.\
</p><p>Gibbs&#160;: Aye.\
</p><p>Will&#160;: How did Jack get off the island?\
</p><p>Gibbs&#160;: Well, I?ll tell ye. He waded out into the shallows and there he waited three days and three nights till all manner of sea creature&#160;?came and acclimated to his presence. And on the fourth morning, he roped himself a couple of sea turtles, lashed&#160;?em together and made a raft. \
</p><p>Will&#160;: He roped a couple of sea turtles?\
</p><p>Gibbs&#160;: Aye, sea turtles.\
</p><p>Will&#160;: What did he use for rope?\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: [ Jack comes up] Human hair?from my back. Let go of the anchor!\
</p><p>Crew: Let go of the anchor, sir!\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: Young Mr. Turner and I are to go ashore.\
</p><p>Gibbs&#160;: Captain! What if the worst should happen?\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: Keep to the code.\
</p><p>Gibbs&#160;: Aye, the code.\
</p><p>Scene 15: (The blood ritual and Jack&#160;?s not dead)\
</p><p>Pintel: Ten years of hoarding swag.\
</p><p>Ragetti: And now we finally get to spend it. [they empty a trunk and it turns out to be full of ladies? clothes; they both pick up parasols]\
</p><p>Pintel: Once we?re quit of the curse, we?ll be rich men. And you can buy an eye what actually fits and is made of glass.\
</p><p>Ragetti: This one does splinter something terrible. [rubs it]\
</p><p>Pintel: Stop rubbing it. [ Bo?sun walks by and rolls his eyes at them]\
</p><p>[in the boat] Will&#160;: [sees a skull] What Code is Gibbs to keep to if the worst should happen?\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: Pirate?s Code. Any man that falls behind?is left behind.\
</p><p>Will&#160;: No heroes amongst thieves, eh?\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: You know, for having such a bleak outlook on pirates you?re well on your way to becoming one. Sprung a man from jail, commandeered a ship of the Fleet, sailed with a buccaneer crew out of Tortuga [they both look at the gold on the bottom of the little river]&#160;?and you?re completely obsessed with treasure.\
</p><p>Will&#160;: That?s not true. I am not obsessed with treasure.\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: [looks in on the gathering] Not all treasure is silver and gold, mate.\
</p><p>Barbossa: Gentlemen, the time has come! Our salvation is nigh! Our torment is near at end.\
</p><p>Will: Elizabeth .\
</p><p>Barbossa: For ten years we?ve been tested and tried, and each man jack of you  here has proved his mettle a hundred times over and a hundred times again! [the men cheer]\
</p><p>Ragetti: Suffered, I have.\
</p><p>Barbossa: Punished, we were. The lot of us - disproportionate to our crimes! Here it is [throws off the chest?s lid]&#160;?the cursed treasure of Cort�s himself. Every last piece that went astray, we have returned?save for this. [points to the medallion on Elizabeth&#160;?s neck]\
</p><p>Will&#160;: [scrambles up, upsetting some of the treasure] Jack&#160;!\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: [pulls him down] Not yet. We wait for the opportune moment.\
</p><p>Barbossa: 881 we found but despaired of ever finding the last.\
</p><p>Will&#160;: When?s that? When it?s of greatest profit to you?\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: May I ask you something? Have I ever given you reason not to trust me? Do us a favor&#160;? I know it?s difficult for you, but please stay here and try not to do anything stupid.\
</p><p>Barbossa: And who among us has paid the blood sacrifice owed to the heathen gods?\
</p><p>Pirates: Us!\
</p><p>Barbossa: And whose blood must yet be paid?\
</p><p>Pirates: Hers!\
</p><p>Barbossa: You know the first thing I?m goin? to do after the curse is lifted? Eat a whole bushel of apples. [takes up the knife] Begun by blood?by blood undone.\
</p><p>Will&#160;: [hits Jack with oar] Sorry, Jack . I?m not going to be your leverage.\
</p><p>Elizabeth&#160;: [her palm is cut] That?s it?\
</p><p>Barbossa: Waste not. [drops the medallion; there is an anticipation to see if it worked]\
</p><p>Koehler: Did it work?\
</p><p>Ragetti: I don?t feel no different.\
</p><p>Pintel: How do we tell? [Barbossa shoots him]\
</p><p>Koehler: You?re not dead.\
</p><p>Pintel: No. He shot me!\
</p><p>Ragetti: It didn?t work.\
</p><p>Twigg: The curse it still upon us!\
</p><p>Barbossa: You, maid! Your father, what was his name? Was your father William Turner&#160;?\
</p><p>Elizabeth&#160;: No.\
</p><p>Barbossa: Where?s his child? The child that sailed from England eight years ago, the child in whose veins flows the blood of William Turner . Where? [backhands her and she falls down]\
</p><p>Bo?sun&#160;: You two! You brought us the wrong person!\
</p><p>Pintel: No! She had the medallion. she?s the proper age.\
</p><p>Ragetti:  She said her name was Turner&#160;? you heard her! [ Will motions for Elizabeth to follow him into the water; she takes the medallion with her] I think she lied to us.\
</p><p>Twigg: You brought us here for nothing.\
</p><p>Barbossa: I won?t take questioning and no second guesses, not from the likes of you, Master Twigg .\
</p><p>Koehler: Who?s to blame? Every decision you?ve made has led us from bad to worse.\
</p><p>Pirate: It was you who sent Bootstrap to the depths!\
</p><p>Bo?sun&#160;: And it?s you who brought us here in the first place.\
</p><p>Barbossa: If any coward here dare challenge me, let him speak! Hmm?\
</p><p>Koehler: I say, we cut her throat and spill all her blood, just in case.\
</p><p>Barbossa: [sees the monkey pointing] The medallion! She?s taken it! Get after her! You feckless pack of ingrates!\
</p><p>Pirates: No oars here. Where?s the oars?\
</p><p>Bo?sun&#160;: The oars have gone missing. Find them!\
</p><p>Ragetti: [spots Jack ] You.\
</p><p>Pintel: You?re supposed to be dead!\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: Am I not? [looks down at himself] Oh. [finds pistols pointed at him] Palulay?palu-li-la-la-lulu, parlili? parsnip, pasley, par -  partner, partner?\
</p><p>Ragetti: Parley?\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: Parley! That?s the one. Parley! Parley!\
</p><p>Pintel: Parley? Down to the depths whatever man that thought up&#160;?parley!?\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: That would be the French.\
</p><p>Scene 16: (Keeping to the code, revealing the medallion, and talk of negotiation)\
</p><p>Elizabeth&#160;: [boards the Interceptor] Not more pirates.\
</p><p>Gibbs&#160;: Welcome aboard, Miss Elizabeth .\
</p><p>Elizabeth&#160;: Mr. Gibbs&#160;?\
</p><p>Gibbs&#160;: [Will climbs aboard] Hey, boy, where be Jack&#160;?\
</p><p>Elizabeth&#160;: Jack&#160;? Jack Sparrow&#160;?\
</p><p>Will&#160;: He fell behind. [leads Elizabeth away]\
</p><p>Gibbs&#160;: Keep to the code.\
</p><p>Anamaria: Weigh anchor! Hoist the sails! Make quickly, divvies.\
</p><p>[in the cave] Barbossa: How the blazes did you get off that island?\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: When you marooned me on that godforsaken spit of land, you forgot one very important thing, mate. I?m Captain Jack Sparrow .\
</p><p>Barbossa: Ah, well, I won?t be making that mistake again. Gents, you all remember Captain Jack Sparrow&#160;? Kill him. [the pirates all point their weapons at Jack ]\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: The girl?s blood didn?t work, did it?\
</p><p>Barbossa: Hold your fire! [the pirates reluctantly lower their weapons] You know whose blood we need?\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: I know whose blood ye need.\
</p><p>[in the cabin of the Interceptor] Elizabeth&#160;: [trying to bandage her palm] What sort of a man trades a man?s life for a ship?\
</p><p>Will: Pirate. Here. Let me. [puts on bandages]\
</p><p>Elizabeth&#160;: Thank you.\
</p><p>Will&#160;: You said you gave Barbossa my name as yours. Why?\
</p><p>Elizabeth&#160;: I don?t know. [she winces and pulls away]\
</p><p>Will&#160;: I?m sorry. Blacksmith?s hands - I know they?re rough.\
</p><p>Elizabeth&#160;: No?I mean yes, they are but? but don?t stop.\
</p><p>Will: Elizabeth .\
</p><p>Elizabeth&#160;: [takes out medallion] It?s yours.\
</p><p>Will: I thought I?d lost it the day they rescued me. It was a gift from my father. He sent it to me. Why did you take it?\
</p><p>Elizabeth&#160;: Because I was afraid that you were a pirate. That would have been awful.\
</p><p>Will&#160;: It wasn?t your blood they needed. It was my father?s blood?my blood?the blood of a pirate.\
</p><p>Elizabeth&#160;: Will, I?m so sorry, please forgive me. [ Will slams down the medallion on the table and she leaves]\
</p><p>[in the Captains cabin of the Black Pearl ] Barbossa: So you expect to leave me standing on some beach with nothing but a name and your word it?s the one I need and watch you sail away in my ship?\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: No. I expect to leave you standing on some beach with absolutely no name at all, watching me sail away on my ship and then I?ll shout the name back to you. Savvy?\
</p><p>Barbossa: But that still leaves us with the problem of me standing on some beach with naught but a name and your word it?s the one I need.\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: Of the two of us, I am the only one who hasn't committed mutiny, therefore?my word is the one we'll be trusting. Although?I suppose I should be thanking you because, in fact, if you hadn?t betrayed me and left me to die, I would have an equal share in that curse, same as you. [bites into an apple] Funny ol' world, innit? [offers him an apple]\
</p><p>Bo?sun&#160;: [enters] Captain, we?re coming up on the Interceptor. [Barbossa goes topside]\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: [runs out after Barbossa and stands in front of him at the bow, blocking the view of the Interceptor] I?m having a thought here, Barbossa. What say we run up a flag of truce? I scurry over to the Interceptor, and I negotiate the return of your medallion, eh? What say you to that?\
</p><p>Barbossa: Now you see, Jack , that?s exactly the attitude that lost you the Pearl . People are easy to search when they?re dead. [to Bo?sun ] Lock him in the brig. [throws away Jack&#160;?s apple]\
</p><p>Scene 17: (The chase and the fight)\
</p><p>Gibbs&#160;: Hands aloft to loose t'gallants! With this wind at her stern, she'll carry every sail we've got.\
</p><p>Elizabeth&#160;: [the crew is running around] What?s happening?\
</p><p>Anamaria: The Black Pearl, she?s gaining on us. [looks out at the Pearl ]\
</p><p>Elizabeth&#160;: This is the fastest ship in the Caribbean .\
</p><p>Anamaria: You can tell them that after they?ve caught us.\
</p><p>Elizabeth&#160;: We?re shallow on the draft, right?\
</p><p>Anamaria: Aye.\
</p><p>Elizabeth&#160;: Well, then can't we lose them amongst those shoals?\
</p><p>Gibbs&#160;: We don?t have to outrun them long, just long enough.\
</p><p>Anamaria: Lighten the ship, stem to stern!\
</p><p>Gibbs&#160;: Anything that we can afford to lose?see that it?s lost.\
</p><p>[on the Black Pearl ] Jack&#160;: [is locked in the brig by Bo?sun&#160;; he sloshes in the water] Apparently there?s a leak.\
</p><p>Barbossa: Haul on the main brace! Make ready the guns! And run out the sweeps. [the gun ports are opened and the Jolly Roger is hoisted up]\
</p><p>[on the Interceptor, barrels are tossed over the side] Will&#160;: [looks out at the Black Pearl and sees the oars; stops a cannon from being thrown off] We?re gonna need that.\
</p><p>Anamaria: [sees the oars] It was a good plan?up&#160;?till now.\
</p><p>Will: Gibbs&#160;! We have to make a stand. We must fight! Load the guns!\
</p><p>Anamaria: With what?\
</p><p>Will: Anything. Everything! Anything we have left.\
</p><p>Gibbs&#160;: Load the guns! Take shot and langrage. Nails and crushed glass! With a will! [they stuff cutlery and other assorted items into the cannons including Gibbs&#160;? canteen] The Pearl is going to luff up on our port quarter. She?ll rake us without ever presenting a target.\
</p><p>Elizabeth&#160;: Lower the anchor on the right side. On the starboard side!\
</p><p>Will&#160;: It certainly has the element of surprise.\
</p><p>Anamaria: You?re daft, lady! You both are!\
</p><p>Gibbs&#160;: Daft like Jack&#160;! Lower the starboard anchor! Do it, ye dogs, or it?s you we?ll load into the cannons! [the anchor is lowered]\
</p><p>Elizabeth&#160;: [to Anamaria] Let go. [she lets go of the wheel and the ship swings about]\
</p><p>Barbossa: They're clubhaulin'! Hard to port! Rack the starboard oars.\
</p><p>Bo?sun&#160;: Hard to port! [the two ships come up side by side]\
</p><p>Will&#160;: Keep us steady now. Now!\
</p><p>Barbossa: Fire!\
</p><p>Elizabeth&#160;: Fire all! [the ships exchange cannon fire]\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: [a whole is blown in the hull] Stop blowing holes in my ship! [notices that the shot from the cannon destroyed the lock on the cell door]\
</p><p>Gibbs&#160;: We could use a few more ideas, lass.\
</p><p>Elizabeth&#160;: Your turn.\
</p><p>Gibbs&#160;: We need us a devil?s dowry.\
</p><p>Anamaria: We?ll give them her. [points her pistol at Elizabeth ]\
</p><p>Will&#160;: She?s not what they?re after.\
</p><p>Elizabeth&#160;: [notices that it?s not at her throat] The medallion. [ Will goes to search for it below]\
</p><p>Barbossa: Raise yer colors ya bloomin? cockroaches! Hands, grapnels, at the ready. Prepare to board! [Ragetti and Pintel fire a shot that severs the mast and it falls over; grapple hooks are thrown as pirates board the Interceptor] Blast all to carcasses, men! Forward clear to the powder magazine. And the rest of you, bring me the medallion! [pirates board the Interceptor]\
</p><p>Will&#160;: [is trapped when the mast falls] Hey! Hey! Below!\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: [emerges from the hold and takes a rope from a pirate] Thanks very much. [swings onto the Interceptor]\
</p><p>Gibbs&#160;: Jack&#160;!\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: [hands him canteen] Bloody empty. [helps Elizabeth ] That?s not very nice. Where?s the medallion?\
</p><p>Elizabeth&#160;: Wretch! [is about to slap him]\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: [catches her wrist] Ahh. Where?s dear William&#160;?\
</p><p>Elizabeth&#160;: Will&#160;? [sees him under a grate] Will!\
</p><p>Will: Elizabeth&#160;!\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: [sees monkey with medallion] Monkey! [runs after it]\
</p><p>Elizabeth&#160;: I can?t move it. [is dragged away] Will!\
</p><p>Will: Elizabeth&#160;!\
</p><p>Barbossa: [gets medallion from monkey] Why, thank you, Jack .\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: You?re welcome.\
</p><p>Barbossa: Not you. We named the monkey&#160;? Jack .? Gents, our hope is restored! [the pirates ignite the powder leading to the collection of powder kegs while Will struggles to escape the cabin that is full of water]\
</p><p>Scene 18: (Misleading negotiations and walking the plank)\
</p><p>Pintel: [to Jack&#160;?s crew] If any of you as much as thinks the word&#160;?parley,? I?ll have your guts for garters.\
</p><p>Elizabeth&#160;: [the Interceptor is blown up] Will! [attacks Barbossa] You?ve got to stop it! Stop it!\
</p><p>Barbossa: Welcome back, Miss. You took advantage of our hospitality last time. It holds fair now that you return the favor. [pushes her to the crew]\
</p><p>Will&#160;: [leaps up on deck] Barbossa!\
</p><p>Elizabeth&#160;: Will.\
</p><p>Will&#160;: She goes free. [points pistol at Barbossa]\
</p><p>Barbossa: What?s in your head, boy?\
</p><p>Will&#160;: She goes free!\
</p><p>Barbossa: You?ve only got one shot, and we can?t die.\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: [to Will ] Don?t do anything stupid.\
</p><p>Will&#160;: You can?t. I can. [points gun at himself]\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: Like that.\
</p><p>Barbossa: Who are you?\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: [to Barbossa] No one. He?s no one. A distant cousin of my aunt?s nephew twice removed. Lovely singing voice, though&#160;? eunuch.\
</p><p>Will&#160;: My name is Will Turner . My father was Bootstrap Bill Turner. His blood runs in my veins.\
</p><p>Ragetti: He?s the spitting image of ol? Bootstrap Bill come back to haunt us.\
</p><p>Will&#160;: On my word do as I say, or I?ll pull this trigger and be lost to Davy Jones? Locker.\
</p><p>Barbossa: Name your terms, Mr. Turner .\
</p><p>Will&#160;: Elizabeth goes free.\
</p><p>Barbossa: Yes, we know that one. Anything else?\
</p><p>Will&#160;: [sees Jack point at himself] And the crew&#160;? the crew are not to be harmed.\
</p><p>Barbossa: Agreed.\
</p><p>Pintel: [to Elizabeth ] Go on, Poppet, go! Walk the plank!\
</p><p>Will: Barbossa, you lying bastard! You swore she?d go free!\
</p><p>Barbossa: Don?t dare impugn me honor, boy. I agreed she?d go free, but it was you who failed to specify when or where. [ Will&#160;?s gagged] Though it does seem a shame to lose something so fine, don?t it lads?\
</p><p>Pirates: Aye.\
</p><p>Barbossa: So I?ll be having that dress back before you go.\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: [to pirate] I always liked you.\
</p><p>Elizabeth&#160;: It goes with your black heart. [throws him the dress]\
</p><p>Barbossa: [presses it to his face] Ooh, it?s still warm.\
</p><p>Pirate 2: Off you go! Come on!\
</p><p>Bo?sun&#160;: Too long! [shakes plank, Elizabeth falls in]\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: [is dragged up to the plank] I?d really rather hoped we were past all this.\
</p><p>Barbossa: Jack?. Jack . Did ya not notice? That be the same little island that we made you Governor of on our last little trip. [points out the distant island]\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: I did notice.\
</p><p>Barbossa: Perhaps you?ll be able to conjure up another miraculous escape?but I doubt it. [unsheathes his sword and brandishes it at Jack&#160;?s throat] Off you go.\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: Last time, you left me a pistol with one shot.\
</p><p>Barbossa: By the powers, you?re right. Were be Jack&#160;?s pistol? Bring it forward. [the pistol is brought]\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: Seeing as there?s two of us, a gentleman?would give us a pair of pistols.\
</p><p>Barbossa: It?ll be one pistol as before, and you can be the gentleman and shoot the lady and starve to death yourself. [throws the pistol into the sea, Jack jumps in after it and recovers it]\
</p><p>Scene 19: (Marooned again)\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: [looks back at the Pearl&#160;; wades out onto the beach shaking off the ropes that bound his wrists] That?s the second time I?ve had to watch that man sail away with my ship.\
</p><p>Elizabeth&#160;: [follows Jack as he walks] But you were marooned on this island before, weren?t you? So we can escape in the same way you did then.\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: To what point and purpose, young missy? The Black Pearl is gone and unless you have a rudder and a lot of sails hidden in that bodice&#160;? unlikely - young Mr. Turner will be dead long before you can reach him.\
</p><p>Elizabeth&#160;: [follows him as he knocks on a tree trunk then takes four steps and jumps up and down a few times] But you?re Captain Jack Sparrow . You vanished from under the eyes of seven agents of the East India Company. You sacked Nassau Port without even firing a shot. Are you the pirate I?ve read about or not? How did you escape last time?\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: Last time?I was here a grand total of three days, all right? Last time [opens a secret cellar door]&#160;?the rumrunners used this island as a cache. Came by, and I was able to barter a passage off. From the looks of things, they?ve long been out of business. Probably?have your bloody friend Norrington to thank for that. [climbs out with two bottles of rum in his hands]\
</p><p>Elizabeth&#160;: So that?s it then? That?s the secret grand adventure of the infamous Jack Sparrow&#160;? You spent three days lying on a beach, drinking rum?!\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: Welcome to the Caribbean , love. [hands her a bottle]\
</p><p>Elizabeth and Jack&#160;: [singing and dancing around a fire] We're devils and black sheep and really bad eggs. Drink up me 'earties yo ho! Yo ho, yo ho a pirate's life for me.\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: I love this song! Really bad eggs! Ooh. [falls] When I get the Pearl back, I?m gonna teach it to the whole crew, and we?ll sing it all the time!\
</p><p>Elizabeth&#160;: And you?ll be positively the most fearsome pirate in the Spanish Main .\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: Not just the Spanish Main , love. The entire ocean. The entire wo?ld. Wherever we want to go, we?ll go. That?s what a ship is, you know. It?s not just a keel and a hull and a deck and sails that's what a ship needs but what a ship is?what the Black Pearl really is?is freedom.\
</p><p>Elizabeth&#160;: Jack&#160;?it must be really terrible for you to be trapped on this island.\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: Oh, yes. [puts his arm around her shoulder] But the company is infinitely better than last time, I think. The scenery has definitely improved.\
</p><p>Elizabeth&#160;: Mr. Sparrow&#160;?I?m not entirely sure that I?ve had enough rum to allow that kind of talk.\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: I know exactly what you mean, love. [curls his moustache]\
</p><p>Elizabeth&#160;: [toasts] To freedom.\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: To the Black Pearl . [drinks and loses consciousness; wakes in the morning to the smell of smoke; sees the island burning and runs to Elizabeth ] No! Not good! Stop! Not good! What are you doing? You burned all the food, the shade! The rum!\
</p><p>Elizabeth&#160;: Yes, the rum is gone.\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: Why is the rum gone?\
</p><p>Elizabeth&#160;: One, because it is a vile drink that turns even the most respectable men into complete scoundrels. Two, that signal is over a thousand feet high. The entire Royal Navy is out looking for me, do you really think that there is even the slightest chance that they won?t see it?\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: But why is the rum gone?\
</p><p>Elizabeth&#160;: [she sits to stare at the horizon] Just wait, Captain Sparrow. You give it one hour, maybe two, keep a weather eye out and then you will see white sails on that horizon.\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: [takes out pistol, thinks better of it and puts it back, stalks off, imitates Elizabeth ]&#160;?Must?ve been terrible for you to be trapped here, Jack . Must?ve been terrible for you.? Well it bloody is now! [spots the Dauntless] There?ll be no living with her after this.\
</p><p>Scene 20: (A future wedding and Bootstrap?s bootstraps)\
</p><p>Elizabeth&#160;: But we?ve got to save Will .\
</p><p>Governor Swann&#160;: No. You?re safe now. We will return to Port Royal immediately, not go gallivanting after pirates!\
</p><p>Elizabeth&#160;: Then we condemn him to death.\
</p><p>Governor Swann&#160;: The boy?s fate is regrettable, but, then, so was his decision to engage in piracy.\
</p><p>Elizabeth&#160;: To rescue me. To prevent anything from happening to me.\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: If I may be so bold as to inject my professional opinion. The Pearl was listing near to scuppers after the battle. It?s very unlikely she?ll be able to make good time. Think about it. The Black Pearl . The last real pirate threat in the Caribbean , mate. How can you pass that up?\
</p><p>Norrington: By remembering that I serve others, Mr. Sparrow , not only myself.\
</p><p>Elizabeth&#160;: Commodore, I beg you, please do this. For me. As a wedding gift.\
</p><p>Governor Swann&#160;: Elizabeth . Are you accepting the Commodore?s proposal?\
</p><p>Elizabeth&#160;: I am.\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: A wedding! I love weddings?drinks all around! [extends his arms] I know.&#160;?Clap him in irons,? right?\
</p><p>Norrington: Mr. Sparrow , you will accompany these fine men to the helm and provide us with the bearing to Isla de Muerta . You will then spend the rest of the voyage contemplating all possible meanings of the phrase&#160;?silent as the grave.? Do I make myself clear?\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: Inescapably clear.\
</p><p>[in the brig of the Black Pearl&#160;; Pintel and Ragetti are swabbing the floor] Parrot: Awwk, shiver me timbers.\
</p><p>Gibbs&#160;: Cotton&#160;?ere says you missed a bit.\
</p><p>Will&#160;: [to Pintel] You knew William Turner&#160;?\
</p><p>Pintel: Ol? Bootstrap Bill . We knew him. Never sat well with Bootstrap what we did to Jack Sparrow , the mutiny and all. He said it wasn?t right with the Code. That?s why he sent off a piece of the treasure to you as it were. He said we deserved to be cursed? and remain cursed.\
</p><p>Ragetti: Stupid blighter.\
</p><p>Gibbs&#160;: Good man.\
</p><p>Pintel: Well, as you can imagine that didn?t sit too well with the Captain.\
</p><p>Ragetti: That didn?t sit too well with the Captain, at all. Tell him what Barbossa did.\
</p><p>Pintel: I?m telling the story! So?what the Captain did, he strapped a cannon to Bootstraps? bootstraps.\
</p><p>Ragetti: Bootstraps? bootstraps.\
</p><p>Pintel: The last we saw of ol? Bill Turner , he was sinking to the crushing black oblivion of Davy Jones? Locker.&#160;?Course it was only after that we learned we needed his blood to lift the curse.\
</p><p>Ragetti: That?s what you call ironic.\
</p><p>Barbossa: [comes down and throws the key to Will&#160;?s cell to Ragetti] Bring him!\
</p><p>[in a boat with the rest of the soldiers and Jack ] Norrington: I don?t care for the situation. Any attempt to storm the caves could turn to an ambush.\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: Not if you?re the one doing the ambushing. I go in, I convince Barbossa to send his men out with their little boats. You and your mates return to the Dauntless and blast the bejesus outta them with your little cannons, eh? [puts an arm on Norrington?s shoulder] What do you have to lose?\
</p><p>Norrington: [peels off the arm] Nothing I?d lament being rid of.\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: Now, to be quite honest with you, there?s still a slight risk for those aboard the Dauntless which includes the future Mrs. Commodore .\
</p><p>[on the Dauntless] Gillette&#160;: [pulling Elizabeth along with another soldier] Sorry, but for your own safety.\
</p><p>Elizabeth&#160;: Coward! The commodore ordered&#160;? I have to tell him! The pirates! They?re cursed! They cannot be killed!\
</p><p>Gillette&#160;: Don?t worry, miss, he?s already informed of that. A little mermaid flopped up on deck and told him the whole story. [shuts the doors]\
</p><p>Elizabeth&#160;: This is Jack Sparrow&#160;?s doing! [she is locked in]\
</p><p>Scene 21: (The blood ritual, again, interrupted)\
</p><p>[on the way to the Aztec gold] Pintel: [to Will ] No reason to fret. It?s just a prick of the finger, a few drops of blood.\
</p><p>Twigg: No mistakes this time. He?s only half-Turner. We spill it all!\
</p><p>Pintel: Guess there is reason to fret.\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: [pushing through the crowd of pirates] Beg your pardon.\
</p><p>Barbossa: [is ready to slit Will&#160;?s throat] Begun by blood?\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: Excuse me.\
</p><p>Barbossa:&#160;?by blood un&#160;?\
</p><p>Will: Jack&#160;!\
</p><p>Barbossa: S?not possible.\
</p><p>Jack&#160;:  Not probable.\
</p><p>Will&#160;: Where?s Elizabeth&#160;?\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: She?s safe, just like I promised. She's all set to marry Norrington, just like she promised. And you get to die for her, just like you promised. So we're all men of our word really except for Elizabeth who is, in fact, a woman.\
</p><p>Barbossa: Shut up! You?re next. [leans in to slit Will&#160;?s throat again]\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: You don?t want to be doing that, mate.\
</p><p>Barbossa: No, I really think I do.\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: Your funeral.\
</p><p>Barbossa: Why don?t I want to be doing it?\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: Well, because [pushed a pirate?s arm off his shoulder]&#160;?because the HMS Dauntless, pride of the Royal Navy, is floating just offshore. Waiting for you.\
</p><p>[in the boats] Murtogg: What are we doing here?\
</p><p>Mullroy: The pirates come out, unprepared and unawares, we catch&#160;?em in the crossfire, send them down to see Old Hob.\
</p><p>Murtogg: I know why we?re here. I mean why aren?t we doing what it was&#160;? what Mr. Sparrow said we should do. With the cannons and all?\
</p><p>Norrington: Because it was Mr. Sparrow who said it.\
</p><p>Murtogg: You think he wasn?t telling the truth?\
</p><p>[in the cave] Jack&#160;: Just hear me out, mate. You order your men to row out to the Dauntless. They do what they do best. Robert&#160;?s your Uncle, Fannie&#160;?s your Aunt, there you are with two ships. The makings of your very own fleet.&#160;?Course you?ll take the grandest as your flagship, and who?s to argue? But what of the Pearl&#160;? Name me Captain, I?ll sail under your colors, I?ll give you ten percent of me plunder and you get to introduce yourself as?Commodore Barbossa. Savvy?\
</p><p>Barbossa: I s?pose in exchange, you want me not to kill the whelp.\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: No, no, not at all by all means, kill the whelp. Just not yet. Wait to lift the curse until the opportune moment. For instance? [picks up a few medallions] after you?ve killed Norrington?s men? [throws them back as he speaks] every? last? one. [pockets one]\
</p><p>Will&#160;: [sees Jack take a piece of the gold] You?ve been planning this from the beginning. Ever since you learned my name.\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: Yeah.\
</p><p>Barbossa: I want fifty percent of your plunder.\
</p><p>Jack&#160;:  Fifteen.\
</p><p>Barbossa: Forty.\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: Twenty-five. And I?ll buy you the hat. A really big one?Commodore.\
</p><p>Barbossa: We have an accord. [they shake hands]\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: All hand?s to the boats! [sees Barbossa look at him askance] Apologies. You give the orders.\
</p><p>Barbossa: Gents?take a walk. [the pirates walk away]\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: Not to the boats? [the cursed pirates walk on the sea?s floor to the Dauntless, the moonlight revealing their true form]\
</p><p>Scene 22: (Just like Troy and an epic battle)\
</p><p>[in the boats] Norrington: [sees women in a boat] Hold fire.\
</p><p>Ragetti: [dressed in a dress and holding a parasol] This is just like what the Greeks done at Troy .&#160;?Cept they was in a horse?instead of dresses. Wooden horse. [while they?re distracting the soldiers and sailors the pirates are boarding the Dauntless]\
</p><p>[on the Dauntless] Governor Swann&#160;: [to guard] A moment, please. Elizabeth&#160;? I just want you to know I, uh, I believe you made a very good decision today. Couldn?t be more proud of you. [while he talks she throws down a makeshift rope and climbs out into a waiting boat] But, you know, even a good decision if made for the wrong reasons can be a wrong decision.\
</p><p>Sailor: [spots boat with two women] Lieutenant?\
</p><p>Ragetti: Yoo-hoo!\
</p><p>Governor Swann&#160;: Elizabeth&#160;? Are you there? Elizabeth , are you even listening to me? [enters and sees makeshift rope] Oh, what have you done?\
</p><p>Ragetti: Oooh!\
</p><p>Pintel: Stop that! Already feel like a fool.\
</p><p>Ragetti: You look nice, though.\
</p><p>Pintel: I look nice?! [they fight and are revealed; the soldiers on board spot the invading pirates and they fight]\
</p><p>[in the cave; Jack examines the treasure] Barbossa: I must admit, Jack , I thought I had ye figured. But it turns out that you?re a hard man to predict.\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: Me? I'm dishonest. And a dishonest man you can always trust to be dishonest. Honestly. It's the honest ones you want to watch out for, because you can never predict when they're going to do something incredibly? stupid. [unsheathes a pirate?s sword and throws it to Will&#160;; Jack starts fighting with Barbossa]\
</p><p>Barbossa: You?re off the edge of the map, mate. Here there be monsters.\
</p><p>[on the Black Pearl&#160;; Elizabeth comes on board] Grapple: Right. What would you pick to eat first?\
</p><p>Pirate Guard: I think we should decide now. Just so we?re ready when the time comes.\
</p><p>Both: [monkey falls on cannon] What was that?\
</p><p>[down in the hold] Gibbs&#160;: Shh! [sees Elizabeth ] It?s Elizabeth&#160;!\
</p><p>[Ragetti and Pintel board and load the cannons, firing them at the approaching boats with the soldiers]\
</p><p>Norrington: [hears bell tolling] Make for the ship! Move!\
</p><p>[the Governor?s wig is being taken by a cursed pirate, he ends up fighting with a severed arm]\
</p><p>[in the cave] Barbossa: You can?t beat me, Jack . [Jack impales him, Barbossa sighs and, taking out the sword, impales Jack ]\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: [staggers into the moonlight to reveal a skeleton] That?s interesting. [reveals the medallion] I couldn?t resist, \mate. [Barbossa and Jack fight; Jack runs upsets an end table] Sorry.\
</p><p>Barbossa: So what now, Jack Sparrow&#160;? Will it be it two immortals locked in an epic battle until Judgment Day and trumpets sound?  Hmm?\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: Or you could surrender.\
</p><p>Barbossa: Arr. [laughs and runs after Jack ]\
</p><p>[on the Black Pearl&#160;; having just thrown both guards into the sea] Elizabeth&#160;: [runs out from the hold with crew] All of you with me. Will is in that cave and we must save him. Ready? And heave! Please, I need your help! Come on!\
</p><p>Parrot: Any port in the storm.\
</p><p>Gibbs&#160;: Cotton&#160;?s right, we?ve got the Pearl .\
</p><p>Elizabeth&#160;: And what about Jack , you?re just going to leave him?\
</p><p>Sailor: Jack owes us a ship.\
</p><p>Gibbs&#160;: And there?s the code to consider.\
</p><p>Elizabeth&#160;: The code? You?re pirates. Hang the code, and hang the rules! They?re more like guidelines anyway. [rowing the boat alone to the cave] Bloody pirates.\
</p><p>Ragetti: hEY.\
</p><p>Pintel: What?\
</p><p>Ragetti: Is it supposed to be doing that? [points to the Pearl that?s sailing away]\
</p><p>Pintel: They?re stealing our ship!\
</p><p>Ragetti: Bloody pirates! [is knocked on the head and his wooden eye pops out] Ah, me eye! [crawls after it]\
</p><p>Scene 23: (One last shot)\
</p><p>[in the cave] Pirate: [to Will ] I?m gonna teach you the meaning of pain.\
</p><p>Elizabeth&#160;: [enters] Do you like pain? [knocks the pirate with heavy staff] Try wearing a corset. [helps Will up and sees Jack as a skeleton] Whose side is Jack on?\
</p><p>Will&#160;: At the moment? [they string 3 pirates together, stick a grenade into the middle one and push them out of the moonlight]\
</p><p>Pirate: No fair. [they explode]\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: [cuts his hand and bleeds on medallion, tosses it to Will&#160;; Barbossa aims pistol at Elizabeth&#160;; Jack shoots Barbossa while he?s looking at Elizabeth ]\
</p><p>Barbossa: Ten years you carry that pistol, and now you waste your shot.\
</p><p>Will&#160;: He didn?t waste it. [drops both medallions into the chest]\
</p><p>Barbossa: [drops his sword and looks at the blood spreading from his wound] I feel?cold. [falls dead, an apple rolling from his hand; the curse now lifted]\
</p><p>[on board the Dauntless; Koehler suddenly falls dead after being run through by Norrington] Pintel: Parley? [while all the crew realize the curse has been lifted and surrender]\
</p><p>Norrington: The ship is ours, gentlemen.\
</p><p>Sailors and soldiers: Huzzah! Huzzah! Huzzah! [the Governor joins them]\
</p><p>[in the cave] Elizabeth&#160;: We should return to the Dauntless.\
</p><p>Will&#160;: Your fianc� will be wanting to know you?re safe. [ Elizabeth turns away]\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: [swaggers over to Will ] If you were waiting for the opportune moment?that was it. Now, if you?ll be so kind, I?d be much obliged if you?d drop me off my ship.\
</p><p>[Will rowing them in a boat to the Dauntless] Elizabeth&#160;: I?m sorry, Jack.\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: They done what?s right by them. Can?t expect more than that.\
</p><p>Scene 24: (The interrupted hanging and the escape)\
</p><p>Official: [reading a proclamation] Jack Sparrow , be it known that you have?\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: [standing on the gallows] Captain, Captain Jack Sparrow .\
</p><p>Official:&#160;?for your willful commission of crimes against the crown. Said crimes being numerous in quantity and sinister in nature, the most egregious of these to be cited herewith&#160;? piracy, smuggling?\
</p><p>Elizabeth&#160;: [standing with her father and her future husband] This is wrong.\
</p><p>Governor Swann&#160;: Commodore Norrington is bound by the law. As are we all.\
</p><p>Official:&#160;?impersonating an officer of the Spanish Royal Navy, impersonating a cleric of the Church of England?\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: [smiling] Ah, yes. [looks over at the executioner who glares at him]\
</p><p>Official:&#160;?sailing under false colors, arson, kidnapping, looting, poaching, brigandage, pilfering, depravity, depredation, and general lawlessness. And for these crimes you have been sentenced to be, on this day, hung by the neck until dead. May God have mercy on your soul.\
</p><p>Will&#160;: [walks through the crowd to the raised ground on which they stand] Governor Swann . Commodore. Elizabeth . I should have told you every day from the moment I met you. I love you. [walks away; the noose is put around Jack&#160;?s neck]\
</p><p>Elizabeth&#160;: [notices Cotton?s parrot] I can?t breathe. [falls backward; the drums sound]\
</p><p>Governor Swann&#160;: Elizabeth . [he and the Commodore help her]\
</p><p>Will: Move! [throws sword as Jack falls through, the sword sticks in the wood and Jack has a foothold; he fights to the gallows and there cuts Jack free; they fight all the way up to a tower where they are cornered by Norrington?s men]\
</p><p>Norrington: [to Will ] I thought we might have to endure some manner of ill-conceived escape attempt but not from you.\
</p><p>Governor Swann&#160;: On our return to Port Royal , I granted you clemency. And this is how you thank me? By throwing in your lot with him? He?s a pirate!\
</p><p>Will&#160;: And a good man. [Jack points to himself proudly, mouths&#160;?That?s me.?] If all I have achieved here is that the hangman will earn two pairs of boots instead of one, so be it. At least my conscience will be clear.\
</p><p>Norrington: You forget your place, Turner.\
</p><p>Will&#160;: It?s right here?between you and Jack .\
</p><p>Elizabeth&#160;: [stands next to Will ] As is mine.\
</p><p>Governor Swann&#160;: Elizabeth&#160;! Lower your weapons. For goodness? sake put them down! [the weapons are lowered]\
</p><p>Norrington: So this is where your heart truly lies, then?\
</p><p>Elizabeth&#160;: It is.\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: [notices the parrot] Well! I?m actually feeling rather good about this. [to Governor Swann ] I think we've all arrived at a very special place, eh? Spiritually?Ecumenically?Grammatically? [to Norrington] I want you to know that I was rooting for you, mate. Know that. Elizabeth&#160;?it would never have worked between us, darling. I?m sorry. Will&#160;?nice hat. Friends! This is the day that you will always remember as the day that&#160;? [falls over battlement]\
</p><p>Gillette&#160;: Idiot. He has nowhere to go but back to the noose.\
</p><p>Sentry: Sail ho!\
</p><p>Gillette&#160;: What?s your plan of action? Sir?\
</p><p>Governor Swann&#160;: Perhaps on the rare occasion pursuing the right course demands an act of piracy, piracy itself can be the right course?\
</p><p>Norrington: Mr. Turner .\
</p><p>Will&#160;: [to Elizabeth ] I will accept the consequences of my actions.\
</p><p>Norrington: [unsheathes his sword] This is a beautiful sword. I would expect the man who made it to show the same care and devotion in every aspect of his life.\
</p><p>Will&#160;: Thank you.\
</p><p>Gillette&#160;: Commodore! What about Sparrow?\
</p><p>Norrington: Well, I think we can afford to give him one day?s head start. [the soldiers leave with Norrington]\
</p><p>Governor Swann&#160;: So, this is the path you?ve chosen, is it? After all?he is a blacksmith.\
</p><p>Elizabeth&#160;: No. [takes off Will&#160;?s hat] He?s a pirate. [the Governor walks away; Elizabeth and Will kiss]\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: [is heaved onboard the Black Pearl&#160;; to Gibbs ] I thought you were supposed to keep to the Code.\
</p><p>Gibbs&#160;: We figured they were more actual?guidelines. [helps Jack up]\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: [ Cotton hands him his hat] Thank you.\
</p><p>Anamaria: Captain Sparrow [puts his coat around his shoulders]&#160;?the Black Pearl is yours.\
</p><p>Jack&#160;: [walks over to the helm and looks around fondly] On deck, you scabrous dogs! Man the braces! Let down and haul to run free. Now...bring me that horizon. [hums and takes out his compass] And really bad eggs?drink up, me 'earties, yo ho.\
</p><p>END\
</p><p>[After the credits]\
</p><p>[ Jack the monkey emerges from the water and scampers over to the chest with the Aztec gold; he takes one of the medallions and is cursed once more; the moonlight shows the monkey as a skeleton and screeching, he jumps at the camera]\
</p>













<p>SCENE 1: The interrupted wedding 
</p><p>[Port Royal – It’s raining and the wedding reception area is deserted except for the bride, Elizabeth, sitting on her haunches facing the ocean, bouquet of lowers in her hands, hair and dress soaking; ships with the East India Trading Company insignia on their flags anchor in the bay, long boats sail ashore; on one there is a horse and rider; the soldiers swarm the smithy and Elizabeth rushes off as she must have been just told of the soldiers] 
</p><p>Elizabeth: [Will is in irons, surrounded by East India Trading Company soldiers] Will. Why is this happening? 
</p><p>Will: I don’t know. [pause] You look beautiful. 
</p><p>Elizabeth: I think it’s bad luck for the groom to see the bride before the wedding. 
</p><p>Governor Swann: Make way. Let me through! [pushes past the soldiers towards the couple, is barred by crossed spears] How dare you! Stand your men down at once! Do you hear me? 
</p><p>Beckett: [a soldier helps him take off his coat] Governor Weatherby Swann, it’s been too long. 
</p><p>Governor Swann: Cutler Beckett? 
</p><p>Beckett: It’s Lord now. Actually. 
</p><p>Governor Swann: [the spears are uncrossed, he makes his way towards Beckett] Lord or not, you have no reason and no authority to arrest this man. [motions to Will] 
</p><p>Beckett: In fact, I do. Mr. Mercer? [Mercer brings a wooden box to Beckett] 
</p><p>Beckett: [takes out a paper] The warrant for the arrest of one William Turner. [hands it over to Governor Swann] 
</p><p>Governor Swann: [looks at it, looks again] This warrant is for Elizabeth Swann! 
</p><p>Beckett: Oh, is it? That’s annoying, my mistake… [takes paper back] Arrest her. 
</p><p>Elizabeth: [soldiers grab her] On what charges?! 
</p><p>Will: [Will moves to stop them] No! 
</p><p>Beckett: Aha, here’s the one for William Turner. [hands another other paper over; Governor Swann looks at it in disbelief] And I have another one for a Mr. James Norrington. Is he present? 
</p><p>Elizabeth: What are the charges? 
</p><p>Governor Swann: Commodore Norrington resigned his commission some months ago. 
</p><p>Beckett: I don’t believe that was the answer to the question I asked. 
</p><p>Will: Lord Beckett, in the category of questions not answered – 
</p><p>Elizabeth: We are under the jurisdiction of the King’s governor of Port Royal and you Will tell us what we are charged with. 
</p><p>Governor Swann: The charge… is conspiring to set free a man convicted of crimes against the Crown and Empire and condemned to death for which the… [the Governor breaks off] 
</p><p>Beckett: For which the punishment, regrettably, is also death. [he steps up to Will] Perhaps you remember a certain pirate named Jack Sparrow. 
</p><p>Will and Elizabeth: [chorus forcefully] Captain! 
</p><p>Elizabeth: Captain Jack Sparrow. 
</p><p>Beckett: Captain Jack Sparrow. Yes, I thought you might. 
</p><p>SCENE 2: Jack’s entrance and a drawing of a key 
</p><p>[on the Pearl] Gibbs: 50 men on a dead man’s chest. Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum. Drink and the devil had done for rest. Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum. Ha ha ha ha ha! [drinks from the bottle in his had; an ominous gong sounds and a pack of crows flies overhead] 
</p><p>[Pirate prison – a whimpering and screaming prisoner is dragged inside, his ankles rubbed raw from manacles; a crow plucks an eye from another who is hanging in an iron cage; the doors close; on the crag nearby, surf breaking on the rocks below, mean are throwing coffins into the waves; we follow a particular one as it floats away; a crow settles on the lid and starts pecking at it until it is blown away by a pistol shot that comes from inside the coffin; a hand holding a pistol emerges and swings around in case anyone else should be about before retreating; Jack sparrow breaks through the flimsy wood, re-shapes his favorite hat, and puts it on his head] 
</p><p>Jack: [he looks around before reaching back into the coffin] Sorry, mate. [with a crack, he breaks off a skeleton’s leg and uses it as a paddle] Do you mind if we make a little side trip? I didn’t think so. 
</p><p>Gibbs: [helps Jack up on board and gets the skeleton leg in return] Not quite according to plan. 
</p><p>Jack: Complications arose, ensued, were overcome. [walks towards the helm] 
</p><p>Gibbs: [hands the leg to Cotton standing next to him and follows Jack] You got what you went in for, then? 
</p><p>Jack: Muhuh. [waves around a rolled up piece of cloth and is met by a disgruntled looking Crew] 
</p><p>Gibbs: Captain, I think the Crew – meaning me, as well – were expecting something a bit more… [he shakes his hands at chest level as if visualizing] shiny. What with the Isla de Muerta going all pear-shapes, reclaimed by the sea and the treasure with it. 
</p><p>Pirate #1: And the Royal Navy chasing us all around the Atlantic. 
</p><p>Marty: And the hurricane! [everyone voice agreement] 
</p><p>Gibbs: All in all, it seems some time since we did a speck of honest pirating. 
</p><p>Jack: Shiny? 
</p><p>Gibbs: Aye, shiny. 
</p><p>Jack: Is that how you’re all feeling, then? Perhaps dear ol’ Jack is not serving your best interests as Captain? 
</p><p>Cotton’s parrot: Awk, walk the plank. [Cotton puts a hand over it’s beak before it continue] 
</p><p>Jack: [cocks his pistol and aims it at the parrot] What did the bird say?! 
</p><p>Pirate #1: Do not blame the bird. Show us, what is on that piece of cloth there. [everyone looks pointedly at the roll of cloth in Jack’s hand before the moment is broken by Barbossa’s undead monkey dropping down in front of Jack and taking the cloth; it manages to run a bit before Jack shoots it and it drops the cloth] 
</p><p>Gibbs: You know that don’t do no good. 
</p><p>Jack: It does me. 
</p><p>Marty: [picks up the unrolled cloth] It’s a key. 
</p><p>Jack: [takes it from him] No, much more better! It is a drawing of a key. [unfolds it and shows it to the Crew; everyone stares in silence and Jack seems disconcerted] Gentlemen, what do keys do? 
</p><p>Pirate #1: Keys… unlock things? 
</p><p>Gibbs: And whatever this key unlocks, inside there’s something valuable. So, we’re setting out to find whatever this key unlocks! 
</p><p>Jack: No. [Gibbs looks confused] We don’t have the key, we can’t open whatever it is we don’t have that it unlocks. So, what purpose would be served in finding whatever need be unlocked, which we don’t have, without first having found the key what unlocks it. 
</p><p>Gibbs: So, we’re going after this key! 
</p><p>Jack: You’re not making any sense at all. [Gibbs looks even more baffled] Any more questions? 
</p><p>Marty: So… Do we have a heading? 
</p><p>Jack: Ah! [goes for his compass] A heading. Set sail in a… [the compass needle swings this way and that without stopping and Jack’s finger follows it] general… [picks a random direction] that way direction! 
</p><p>Gibbs: Captain? 
</p><p>Jack: Come on. Snap to and make sail, you know how this works. Oi, oi! [shoos pirates out of his way as he walks to his cabin] 
</p><p>Marty: I’ve notice lately, the Captain seem to be acting a bit strange…er. [shrugs] 
</p><p>Gibbs: Setting sail without knowing his own heading, something’s got Jack vexed. You mark my words, what bodes ill for Jack Sparrow, bodes ill for us all. 
</p><p>SCENE 3: Negotiations and time’s up 
</p><p>[back in Port Royal a map is being painted; Will is led into Beckett’s office still shackled] 
</p><p>Soldier: Lord Beckett, the prisoner as ordered, sir. 
</p><p>Beckett: Those won’t be necessary. [points out the chains, the soldier nods, and undoes the chains; Beckett pours them drinks] The East India Trading Company has need of your services. [hands Will a drink and puts it down when Will does not take it] We wish for you to act as our agent in a business transaction with our mutual friend – Captain Sparrow. 
</p><p>Will: More acquaintance than friend. How do you know him? 
</p><p>Beckett: We’ve had dealings in the past. [holds up a red-hot ‘P’ brand] And we’ve each left our mark on the other. 
</p><p>Will: What mark did he leave on you? 
</p><p>Beckett: [ignores the question and places the brand back in the fireplace] By your efforts, Jack Sparrow was set free. I would like you to go to him and recover a certain property in his possession. 
</p><p>Will: Recover. At the point of a sword? 
</p><p>Beckett: Bargain. [opens his wooden box with the East India Trading Company insignia and removes a leather case and takes out a few sheaves of paper] Letters of Marque. You Will offer what amounts to a full pardon – Jack Will be free, a privateer in the employ of England. 
</p><p>Will: Somehow I doubt Jack Will consider employment the same as being free. 
</p><p>Beckett: [scoffs softly] Freedom. [puts the papers away and walks out onto the balcony; Will follows] Jack Sparrow is a dying breed. The world is shrinking. The blank edges of the map filled in. Jack must find his place in the New World or perish. Not unlike you, Mr. Turner. You and your fiancÃ©e face the hangman’s noose. 
</p><p>Will: So you get both Jack and the Black Pearl. 
</p><p>Beckett: The Black Pearl? 
</p><p>Will: The property you want that he possesses. 
</p><p>Beckett: A ship? Hardly. The item in question is considerably smaller and far more valuable. Something Sparrow keeps on his person at all times: a compass? [Will shows recognition on his face] Ah, you know it. Bring back that compass, or there’s no deal. [Beckett walks away] 
</p><p>[on The Black Pearl Jack is trying to chart the map, the pirate brand clearly visible; he taps the compass trying to get it to show a heading, but it refuses to cooperate] 
</p><p>Jack: [picks up a rum bottle, turns it upside down, but it is empty] Why is the rum always gone? [he gets up and is wobbly on his feet] Oh… that’s why. [puts on his hat and heads to the stores, passing through the Crew quarters; the Crew is asleep and snoring] As you were, gents. [the stores look empty until Jack spots one more bottle, unfortunately it is filled with what looks like sand] 
</p><p>Bootstrap: Time’s run out, Jack. 
</p><p>Jack: [drops the bottle and moves closer, his lantern lighting the way] Bootstrap. Bill Turner? 
</p><p>Bootstrap: [emerges from the shadows, barnacles covering his body and sea water spilling from his mouth] You look good, Jack. 
</p><p>Jack: [stares at him] Is this a dream? 
</p><p>Bootstrap: No. 
</p><p>Jack: I thought not, if it were, there’d be rum. [Bootstrap stretches out his arm with a creak, there’s a bottle of rum in his hand; Jack takes it with some difficulty] 
</p><p>Bootstrap: You got the Pearl back, I see. 
</p><p>Jack: I had some help retrieving the Pearl, by the way. Your son. 
</p><p>Bootstrap: William? Ended up pirate after all. 
</p><p>Jack: And to what do I owe the pleasure of your carbuncle? 
</p><p>Bootstrap: He sent me. Davy Jones. 
</p><p>Jack: Ah. So it’s you, then. He shanghaied you into service, eh? 
</p><p>Bootstrap: I chose it. I’m sorry for the part I played in the mutiny against you, Jack. [a little crab escapes from his sleeve, he grabs it and eats it] I stood up for ya. Everything went wrong after that. They strapped me to a cannon, I ended up on the bottom of the ocean, the weight of the water crushing down on me. Unable to move, unable to die, Jack, and I thought that even the tiniest hope of escaping this fate, I would take it. I would trade anything for it. 
</p><p>Jack: It’s funny what a man Will do to forestall his final judgment. 
</p><p>Bootstrap: You made a deal with him, too, Jack. He raised the Pearl from the depths for you, thirteen years you’ve been Captain. 
</p><p>Jack: Technically, I – 
</p><p>Bootstrap: Jack. Won’t be able to talk yourself out of this. The terms would apply to me, apply to you, as well. One soul, bound to Crew a hundred years upon his ship. 
</p><p>Jack: Yes, but The Flying Dutchman already has a Captain, so there’s really – 
</p><p>Bootstrap: Then it’s the Locker for you! Though this is terrible, the leviathan Will find you and drag the Pearl back to the depths and you along with it. 
</p><p>Jack: Any idea when Jones might release said terrible beastie? 
</p><p>Bootstrap: I already told you, Jack. The time is up. [puts something in Jack’s hand] It comes now. Drawn with ravenous hunger for the man what bears the black spot. [Jack opens his hand and a black spot spreads out on the palm of the hand that Bootstrap touched] 
</p><p>Jack: [slightly panicked, Jack rushes out to the Crew quarters] On deck all hands! Make faster—gasket! On deck! Scurry! Scurry on! Move it! Move it!! I want movement! [there is chaos below decks] 
</p><p>Gibbs: [trying to pull his clothes on] Mr. Skinner, pick it up! (??) 
</p><p>Jack: [runs up on deck] I want a—- (??), plenty running. Run as if the devil himself and itself was upon us! [wraps his marked hand with a strip of cloth] 
</p><p>Gibbs: Do we have a heading? 
</p><p>Jack: [doesn’t see Gibbs] Ah! Rum! Land. [Gibbs walks away and then pops up on another side of the stairs under which Jack is trying to hide] Ah! 
</p><p>Gibbs: Which port? 
</p><p>Jack: I didn’t say port. I said land, any land. [the undead monkey climbs by and knocks off Jack’s hat] Ah! [they hiss at each other] 
</p><p>Gibbs: Jack’s hat! Steer about! 
</p><p>Jack: No, no, leave it. [everyone looks at him funny] Rum. [he hurries away] 
</p><p>Gibbs: Back to your stations, the lot of ya! [spots Jack under the stairs again] Jack? 
</p><p>Jack: Shh! 
</p><p>Gibbs: For the love of Mother and Child, Jack, what’s coming after us? 
</p><p>Jack: Nothing. 
</p><p>[we see Jack’s hat floating on the sea, a foreign Sailor on another ship spots it and fishes it out; he puts it on and pretends to salute, another walks up and demands it from him and puts the hat on his own head; they stop bickering when they hear an ominous groaning underneath; the one in possession of the hat frantically tries to give it to the one who had found it, but he doesn’t want it anymore; with a crack and a splash, the ship is crushed and taken underwater] 
</p><p>SCENE 4: The search for Jack 
</p><p>[in Port Royal, Will is getting ready to leave and goes to see Elizabeth before he does] 
</p><p>Prison guard: You’re not… you can’t be here. [tries to stop Will from going to Elizabeth] 
</p><p>Governor Swann: I think you’ll find he can. 
</p><p>Prison guard: Mr. Swann. 
</p><p>Governor Swann: Governor Swann, still. Do you think I wear this wig to keep my head warm? 
</p><p>Elizabeth: [talking through the bars] Jack’s compass? What does Beckett want with that? 
</p><p>Will: Doesn’t matter. I’m to find Jack and convince him to return to Port Royal and in exchange the charges against us Will be dropped. 
</p><p>Governor Swann: No, we must find our own avenue to secure your freedom. 
</p><p>Will: Is that a lack of faith in Jack… or in me? 
</p><p>Governor Swann: You would risk your life to save Sparrow’s does not mean that he would do the same for anyone else. Now, where’s that dog with the keys? [looks around for the dog and whistles] 
</p><p>Elizabeth: I have faith in you. Both of you. Where Will you find him? 
</p><p>Will: Tortuga. I’ll start there and I won’t stop searching ‘till I find him. And then I intend to return here to marry you. 
</p><p>Elizabeth: Properly? 
</p><p>Will: With your leave, if you’ll still have me. 
</p><p>Elizabeth: If it weren’t for these bars, I’d have you already. [Governor Swann breaks off a piece of a wall sconce, looks around and drops it in a dark corner] I’ll wait for you. 
</p><p>Will: Keep a weather eye on the horizon. [is so close he can kiss her, but tears himself away and leaves quickly] 
</p><p>[Will is looking for Jack everywhere and no one can tell him where he is] 
</p><p>Sailor #1: Captain Jack Sparrow? Hadn’t been thought about, heard he was dead. 
</p><p>Sailor #2: Singapore, that’s what I heard. Drunk, with a smile. Sure as a tide, Jack Sparrow, turned up in Singapore. 
</p><p>Giselle: Jack Sparrow? 
</p><p>Scarlett: I haven’t seen him in a month. 
</p><p>Giselle: When you find him, you give ‘im a message. [slaps Will] 
</p><p>Sailor #3: Can’t say about Jack Sparrow, but this island just south of the straits where I trade spice for… delicious, long pork. Cannot say about Jack. But you’ll find that ship there. A ship with black sails. 
</p><p>[on board a ship taking Will to the Black Pearl beached on an island] 
</p><p>Captain: My brother Will take you ashore. 
</p><p>Will: [the Sailor stops rowing their boat] What’s wrong, the beach is right there? 
</p><p>Sailor: Ne bougeais pas, c’set beaucoup trop dangereaux. 
</p><p>Will: What? 
</p><p>Sailor: Je ne pois, c’est trop dangereaux, j’avais le dit. [Will makes ready to dive] Bon voyage, monsieur. [Will dives and swims the rest of the way] 
</p><p>Will: [walks ashore next to the Peal] Jack! Jack Sparrow! Marty! Cotton! Anybody? [he sees no one and makes his way into the jungle, spots Cotton’s parrot] Ah, a familiar face. 
</p><p>Cotton’s parrot: Awk, don’t eat me! 
</p><p>Will: [looks confused] I’m not going to eat you. 
</p><p>Cotton’s parrot: Don’t eat me. Don’t eat me. Awk! 
</p><p>Will: [walks on, spots Gibbsâ€™ canteen hanging] Gibbs. [follows the rope that had been tied to it and is captured by the cannibals; hanging upside down by one foot he swings his sword around] Come on! Let’s go! Come on, who wants it?! I can do this all day! [the cannibals look at each other then one shoots a poisoned dart at the wildly swinging Will; it hits his neck and he is knocked out, sword dropping from his hand; he is shown being carried tied like a side of meat on a roasting stick to their village] 
</p><p>Cannibal #1: [addressing the chief] Kali kali ten dah dah. 
</p><p>Will: [wakes up and sees their chief] Jack? Jack Sparrow. I can honestly say I’m glad to see you. [Jack rises and pokes his shoulder] Jack, it’s me, Will Turner! 
</p><p>Jack: [addressing the cannibal] Pah se ko? 
</p><p>Cannibals: Teen dada, eeseetis. [everyone agrees] Eeseetis. 
</p><p>Will: Tell them to let me down. 
</p><p>Jack: [to Will] Kele lam. Nom piki piki, nom minsi winsi. [approaches Will’s backside] Lam seisei, eunichi. Snip snip. [mimes scissors] 
</p><p>Cannibals: [the cannibals all ‘aah’ with understanding] Eunichi. 
</p><p>Will: [spots Jack’s compass] Jack, the compass, it’s all I need. Elizabeth is in danger. We were arrested for trying to help you. She faces the gallows! 
</p><p>Jack: [stands a moment thinking, then approaches the cannibals] Seiserom shup shup sha smame mame shuku, savvy? Maliki liki. [waves Will away] 
</p><p>Cannibals: [started up by one, taken up by all] Maliki liki! Maliki liki! 
</p><p>Jack: [whispers to Will before Will is carried off with a chant of ‘boom shoukoo’] Save me. 
</p><p>Will: Jack, what did you tell them? No! What about Elizabeth? Jaaack! 
</p><p>SCENE 5: The escape, more negotiations and salvaging 
</p><p>[in the Port Royal jail we hear the prisoners whistling and calling ‘good boy, closer’ to what should be a dog, once the camera pans, we see that it’s Elizabeth they’re beckoning to] 
</p><p>Governor Swann: [a guard unlocks her cell] Come quickly. 
</p><p>Prisoner: Where are ye goin’? 
</p><p>Elizabeth: [they leave the jail] You’ve got to tell me what’s happening. 
</p><p>Governor Swann: I may still have some standing in the keep. I’ve arranged passage to England. The Captain is a friend of mine. 
</p><p>Elizabeth: [outraged] No! Will’s gone to find Jack! 
</p><p>Governor Swann: We cannot count on William Turner. Come! [drags her by the arm] 
</p><p>Elizabeth: He’s a better man than you give him credit for. 
</p><p>Governor Swann: Of course, this is no time for innocence. Beckett has offered one pardon only. One! And that is promised to Jack Sparrow. Even if Will succeeds… you’re not asking me to endure the sight of my daughter walking to the gallows. Do not. [leads her into a carriage] Perhaps, I can ensure a fair trial for Will, if he returns. 
</p><p>Elizabeth: A fair trial for Will ends in a hanging. 
</p><p>Governor Swann: Then there is nothing left for you here. [closes the door and drives the carriage to the dock; to Elizabeth] Wait inside. [makes his way towards the ship at anchor] Captain? [spots the Captain with his back to him] Captain! [the Captain was impaled on Mr. Mercer’s sword and once the sword is taken out, drops to the ground: dead] Oh…! 
</p><p>Mercer: Evening, Gov’ner. [wipes the blade of his sword clean of blood] Shame, huh? [indicates the dead body] He was carrying this [he’s holding a leather case] It’s a letter to the King. It’s from you. 
</p><p>Governor Swann: Ah… [nervously turns back to the carriage to try to save Elizabeth, but more soldiers run up] Elizabeth. Oh! [he is stopped by a soldier before he can get near the carriage] What are you doing?! 
</p><p>Mercer: [opens the carriage but there is no one inside] Where is she? 
</p><p>Governor Swann: Who? [Swann is swung around until his back is pressed against the carriage; it looks like they want to beat the answer out of him] 
</p><p>[Beckett’s rooms – Beckett enters the study and notices that the chest carrying the pardon papers has been disturbed, opens it and sees the pardon letter gone] 
</p><p>Beckett: No doubt you’ve discovered that loyalty is no longer the currency of the realm as your father believes. 
</p><p>Elizabeth: [steps out of the shadows at his back] Then what is? 
</p><p>Beckett: I’m afraid currency is the currency of the realm. 
</p><p>Elizabeth: I expect then that we can come to some sort of understanding. I’m here to negotiate. [they slowly approach one another] 
</p><p>Beckett: I’m listening. [Elizabeth swings out a pistol, cocks it and points it at his forehead] I’m listening intently. 
</p><p>Elizabeth: [holds up the pardon papers] These Letters of Marque, they are signed by the King? 
</p><p>Beckett: Yes, and they’re not valid until they bear my signature and my seal. 
</p><p>Elizabeth: Or else I would not still be here. You sent Will to get you the compass and buy Jack Sparrow, it Will do you no good. 
</p><p>Beckett: Do explain. 
</p><p>Elizabeth: I have been to the Isla de Muerta, I have seen the treasure myself. There is something you need to know. [she keeps leaning further in as she speaks and Beckett keeps leaning away] 
</p><p>Beckett: Aah, I see. You think the compass leads only to the Isla de Muerta and so you hope to save me from an evil fate. But you mustn’t worry. [walks towards the large map of the world on the wall] I care not for cursed Aztec gold, my desires are not so provincial. There’s more than one chest of value in these waters. So perhaps you may wish to enhance your offer. 
</p><p>Elizabeth: [puts the muzzle of the pistol under Beckett’s chin and cocks it once more] Consider it in your calculations that you robbed me of my wedding night. [presses the papers to Beckett’s chest roughly] 
</p><p>Beckett: So I did. [takes the papers and unfolds them, signs the letter] A marriage interrupted. [melts the end of a stick of wax in a candle’s flame] Or fate intervenes. [stamps the wax with his signet ring] You’re making great efforts to ensure Jack Sparrow’s freedom. 
</p><p>Elizabeth: These are not going to Jack. 
</p><p>Beckett: Oh, really. To insure Mr. Turner’s freedom? I’ll still want that compass. Consider that in your calculations. [Elizabeth snatches the papers out of his hand and walks cautiously at first, then runs out of the room] 
</p><p>[somewhere on the sea, Ragetti and Pintel are in a little rowboat, Ragetti has a book open and is flipping the pages, his good eye to the small print, while Pintel is doing the rowing] 
</p><p>Ragetti: Well, I say it was divine providence what escaped us from jail. 
</p><p>Pintel: And I’ll say, it was me being clever. [the dog with the keys pops up behind him] Ain’t that right, poochy? 
</p><p>Ragetti: Well, how d’you know it weren’t divine providence what inspired you to be clever. Anyways, I’m no’ stealing no ship. 
</p><p>Pintel: It ain’t stealing, it’s salvaging. And since when did you care? 
</p><p>Ragetti: Since we’re not immortal no more. We’ve got to take care of our immortal souls. [points finger at the open page] 
</p><p>Pintel: You know you can’t read. 
</p><p>Ragetti: It’s the Bible, you get credit for trying. 
</p><p>Pintel: Pretending to read the Bible’s a laugh! That’s a mark against the… [points up into the sky; dog barks and they turn to see what the fuss is about] Look. [they see the Pearl is beached on the island] There it is. [the dog jumps off the boat and makes for the beach] 
</p><p>Ragetti: It’s gonna swim? 
</p><p>Pintel: Must’ve seen a catfish. [raises an eyebrow and chuckles, Ragetti catches on and laughs with him] 
</p><p>Ragetti: [shouts to the dog who’s already on the beach] Stupid mongrel! [they row closer and a wave overturns their boat] 
</p><p>Pintel: Come on! [they approach the ship cackling with glee] It’s ours for the taking! 
</p><p>Ragetti: Tide’s coming in, that should help. Salvaging is saving, in a manner of speaking. 
</p><p>Pintel: There’s the truth of it! [they run up to the ropes holding the ship in place, but stop, looking to the mountain where deep drums sound]
</p><p>Ragetti: Suppose we’d better save it as soon as we can. What with us in such a vulnerable state, y’know? 
</p><p>Pintel: [crosses himself twice] Amen to that. [they scramble up the ropes] 
</p><p>SCENE 6: The interrupted feast 
</p><p>[the cannibals are getting ready for a ritual, drumming rhythmically] 
</p><p>Jack: [two natives attach a necklace of severed human toes and fingers to Jack’s neck] Thank you. [picks out a toe, studies it, bites off the tip of the nail, chews a little and spits it back out] 
</p><p>Will: [hanging in cages suspended in the air between two cliffs] Why would he do this to us? If Jack is the chief – 
</p><p>Gibbs: Aye. The Pelegostos have made Jack their chief. But he only remains chief as long as he acts like a chief. 
</p><p>Will: So he had no choice. He’s a captive there as much as the rest of us. 
</p><p>Gibbs: Worse, as it turns out. You see, the Pelegostos believe that Jack is a god in human form. And they intend to do ‘im the honor of releasing him from his fleshy prison. [Cotton grabs Gibbsâ€™ right hand bites it, Gibbs snatches it away] They’ll roast him and eat him. 
</p><p>Will: Where’s the rest of the Crew? 
</p><p>Gibbs: These cages we’re in weren’t built ‘till after we got here. [Will snatches his hand away from the cage in alarm] The feast is about to begin. Jack’s life Will end… when the drums stop. 
</p><p>Will: Well, we can’t just sit here and wait then, can we? 
</p><p>[at the feast] Jack: [when it looks like the cannibals have finished building a “pyre”] No! No no. Oi, no no! More wood. Big fire. Big fire! I am chief, want big fire! C’mon then. Oi [motions to the one behind his throne] Maboogey snickle snickle. Toute suite. C’mon. [shoos the native away] More wood. [smiles as he see them pile on big logs; when they turn around, he’s gone; Jack runs across a rickety bridge, past some huts and almost falls off a cliff; goes back to the camp, picks up a long bamboo stick, smiles, then looses the smile and drops it; goes into one hut which is filled with what looks like items stolen by the pirates; finds a length of rope and then picks up a can of paprika, on the bottom of which there is an East India Trading Company logo; he steps out of the hut and finds his subjects waiting for him outside] Oh, bugger. [drops the rope and with a flourish uncaps the paprika, sprinkling it under his arms] A little seasoning, aye? [throws the can away and smells himself faintly] 
</p><p>Jack: [is tied for the roasting and hoisted over the kindling; a few more branches are added at the last minute] Well done. 
</p><p>[in the cages, the Crew is swinging the cages, trying to reach the side of the cliff, but not quite making it the first time and almost making it the second if the grass had not torn off in their hands; after several tries, they manage to latch onto stronger vines] 
</p><p>Gibbs: Put your legs through! Start the climb! 
</p><p>Will: [climbing the vine] Come on men, it’ll take all of us to Crew the Black Pearl! 
</p><p>Pirate #1: Actually, you wouldn’t need everyone. About six would do. [the two groups exchange a tense look] Oooh, dear. 
</p><p>Will: [looks to Gibbs who nods in a agreement] Hurry! [they try to outdo each other in the climb] 
</p><p>Marty: Heave! Is that all you’ve got? 
</p><p>Will: [a young native passes on the bridge to their left; Will spots him first] Stop, stop. [whispers forcefully to the ones in the other cage] Stop! [they stop] 
</p><p>Pirate #1: Shh. [motions for the Crew to continue and they move on] 
</p><p>Will: Stop. [he is ignored] 
</p><p>Pirate #1: [grabs a poisonous snake instead of the vine] Snake! Aaaaaa! [everyone let’s go and they fall back, the rope holding the cage over the ravine breaks and they tumble down, screaming all the way; the commotions draws the attention of the young native] 
</p><p>Will: Move! 
</p><p>[at the feast] Cannibal: [runs in with a torch in hand] Aii, fai fai! [lowers a torch in order to light the fire under Jack but the one who saw the prisoners escaping interrupts] 
</p><p>Young Cannibal: La esta so, la pelesa so. Eva kaka seisei. [everyone pauses and stands around in confusion] 
</p><p>Jack: Well, go on, go get them! Helalla! 
</p><p>Cannibals: Helalla! [the one holding the torch drops it next to the kindling and they all run off] No no, oi! No no. Not good. [starts blowing on the spreading embers, but the kindling lights up anyway so he blows faster] 
</p><p>[Will and the Crew get the cage to the top of the cliff] 
</p><p>Will: Pull it loose, find a rock! 
</p><p>[Jack is still on the spit, he’s practically jumping, the bamboo stick jumping with him until he manages to dislodge it and lands next to the fire; he breaks the rope binding his legs and runs off with the stick still tied to him] 
</p><p>[the cannibals reach the cage before the Crew had managed to break it] 
</p><p>Will: Roll the cage! [they roll off, the cannibals running after them; roll up and tree and crash to the ground] Lift the cage! 
</p><p>The Crew: Hurry! 
</p><p>Gibbs: Lift it high like a lady’s skirt. [they lift it and run, holding it up like a skirt; the cannibals are still behind them] 
</p><p>[while the Crew is running from the cannibals, Jack is running across the plank bridge, hunched over because of the pole; runs back to the huts and frees his hands, but the ropes refuse to loosen and the stick stays on his back; he spots a native child who is holding a knife and fork; sidles up to him and grabs the knife, ready to cut the ropes; that’s when he sees the two women staring at him; he screams and charges them, they step aside and he runs pole-first into a pile of coconuts, one of which gets stuck to the tip; he gets a bright idea and launches it at one of them; she stops the coconut from hitting her face without difficulty] 
</p><p>[the Crew is still running from the cannibals, they fall into a crag and down into water where the cage breaks by itself] 
</p><p>Gibbs: This way lads. [they swim for cover, arrows and spears flying down on them] 
</p><p>[meanwhile, Jack is being attacked by various fruits which he blocks with his arms and then they end up being strung onto both ends of the bamboo stick; finally Jack’s had enough] 
</p><p>Jack: Stop it! [the two women stop and stare, there are fruit neatly strung on each end of the pole] 
</p><p>[the Crew hides as the cannibals continue their pursuit; the child from the little village runs up] Child: Manka! Ma estoto. Ma estoto. [points in the direction of the village; everyone rushes off] 
</p><p>[Jack, with a yell, runs for the cliff, the front end of the pole lodges in the ground and he flips to the other side, landing upright just on the edge; the position makes the fruit slide down and they overbalance him; he falls, the rope untangling, his foot caught in a loop on its end] 
</p><p>Native Woman #1: Anifi. 
</p><p>Native Woman #2: Aboogey. 
</p><p>Jack: [the stick starts dislodging, and he’s till handing upside down, dangling by one foot] Bugger. [he falls and over half a dozen plank bridges slow his fall as he breaks through each one, screaming all the way] Ooh. [breaks through another bridge] Ah. [he finally lands on the ground, the pole thudding very down into the earth very close to his head, the fruits not far behind] 
</p><p>[the Crew finally make it out to the Pearl] 
</p><p>Pintel: [a rope in his hands, standing in the surf] Pull loose the mooring line. The mooring line! 
</p><p>Ragetti: [on deck, the monkey’s gets his wooden eye as he’s crawling after it] Hey! Little hairy thing. Give it back! [the monkey puts the eye in it’s mouth] Don’t bite it! 
</p><p>Pintel: Pull loose the mooring line! [Jack’s Crew comes up behind him] 
</p><p>Ragetti: [points to his empty eye socket] It’s got me eye. It won’t give it back. 
</p><p>Pintel: Well, how’d you get it back last time? 
</p><p>Gibbs: [thumps Pintel on the back] Excellent! Our work’s half done! 
</p><p>Pintel: We done it for you! Knew you’d be coming back for it. 
</p><p>Gibbs: Make ready to sail, boys! 
</p><p>Will: What about Jack? I won’t leave without him. 
</p><p>Jack: Oi! [he rounds a corner of the island, the cannibals soon follow] 
</p><p>Will: Time to go. 
</p><p>Gibbs: Cast off those lines! 
</p><p>Ragetti: Make ready to cast off! 
</p><p>Jack: Oi! [runs past the prison dog] Good doggy. [swims out to the Pearl and clings to a net] Alas, my children, this is the day you shall always remember as the day that you almost – [a wave splashes him from head to toe; he continues half-heartedly] – Captain Jack Sparrow. 
</p><p>[the cannibals are lamenting the loss of their meal when the finally hear the dog barking; they turn to it and once it realizes the danger, runs; they run after it] 
</p><p>Gibbs: Let’s put some distance between us and this island and head out to open sea. 
</p><p>Jack: Yes to the first, yes to the second, but only as so far as we keep to the shallows as much as possible. [Pintel and Ragetti drape Jack’s coat on his shoulders; Pintel salutes when Jack glances at him] 
</p><p>Gibbs: Now, that seems a bit contradictory, Captain. 
</p><p>Jack: I have every faith in your reconciliatory navigational skills, Master Gibbs. Now, where is that monkey? I want to shoot something. [as on cue, Ragetti’s wooden eye drops in front of them; Ragetti is happy to have it back] 
</p><p>Will: Jack. 
</p><p>Jack: Ah. 
</p><p>Will: Elizabeth is in danger. 
</p><p>Jack: [moves off, keeping an eye on the monkey] Have you considered keeping a more watchful eye on her. Maybe just lock her up somewhere? 
</p><p>Will: [follows him] She is locked up in a prison, bound to hang for helping you. 
</p><p>Jack: There comes a time when one must take responsibility for one’s mistakes. 
</p><p>Will: [snatches a sword off a nearby pirate and brings it to Jack’s throat] I need that compass of yours, Jack. I must trade it for her freedom.
</p><p>Jack: [moves the sword away] Mr. Gibbs? 
</p><p>Gibbs: Captain? 
</p><p>Jack: We have a need to travel upriver. 
</p><p>Gibbs: By need, do you, mean a trifling need, fleeting, as in, say, a passing fancy? 
</p><p>Jack: No, a resolute and unyielding need. [Gibbs looks worried] 
</p><p>Will: What we need to do is make sail for Port Royal with all haste. 
</p><p>Jack: William… I shall trade you the compass, if you Will help me… [takes the drawing of a key out of his pocket] to find this. 
</p><p>Will: You want me to find this. [indicates the key on the drawing] 
</p><p>Jack: No. You want you to find this. Because the finding of this, finds you incapacitorially finding and/or locating in your discovering the detecting of a way to save your dolly belle ol’ what’s her face. Savvy? 
</p><p>Will: [takes the cloth] This is going to save Elizabeth. 
</p><p>Jack: How much do you know about Davy Jones? 
</p><p>Will: Not much. 
</p><p>Jack: Yeah, it’s going to save Elizabeth. 
</p><p>SCENE 7: The stowaway and visiting Tia Dalma 
</p><p>[on a random ship leaving Port Royal – a Sailor finds Elizabeth’s discarded wedding dress stashed on the side; two Sailors end up bickering over it] 
</p><p>Captain: What’s all this? If you both fancy the dress, you’ll just have to share and wear it one after the other. [the Crew laughs] 
</p><p>Sailor #1: It’s not like that, sir. This ship is haunted. 
</p><p>Captain: Is it now? [addressing the other one] You? 
</p><p>Sailor #2: There is a female presence amongst us here, sir. All the men, they can feel it. [the Crew agrees] 
</p><p>Sailor #3: Belongs to a lady widowed before her marriage, I figure it. Searching for her husband lost the sea. 
</p><p>Sailor #4: Virgin, too, likely as not. [Elizabeth is shown, lacquering the ship’s railing] And that bodes ill by all accounts. 
</p><p>Sailor #1: I say that we throw the dress overboard and we hope the spirit follows it. 
</p><p>Sailor #2: No! That Will just anger this spirit, sir. What we need to do is to find out what the spirit needs and then just get it back to her – [they start bickering over the dress again] 
</p><p>Captain: Enough! Enough! You’re a pair of superstitious goats and it’s got the best of ye. [snatches the dress from them] Now this appears to be as no more that we have a stowaway on board. A young woman, by the look of it. I want you to search the ship and find her. Oh, and, eh, she’s probably naked. [everyone perks up and starts looking for her; Elizabeth joins the search] 
</p><p>[the Black Pearl is anchored and two boats go upriver into an overgrown, gloomy swamp] 
</p><p>Will: Why is Jack afraid of the open ocean? 
</p><p>Gibbs: Well, if you believe such things, there’s a beast does the bidding of Davy Jones. A fearsome creature with giant tentacles that suction your face clean off and drag an entire ship down to the crushing darkness. The Kraken. They say the stench of its breath is… ooh. [shudders] Imagine, the last thing you know on God’s green earth is the roar of the Kraken and the reeking odor of a thousand rotting corpses. [Ragetti and Pintel cower] If you believe such things. 
</p><p>Will: And the key Will spare him that? 
</p><p>Gibbs: Now that’s the very question Jack wants answered. Bad enough even to go visit… her. 
</p><p>Will: [raises an eyebrow] Her? 
</p><p>Gibbs: Aye. 
</p><p>[they finally sail up to a hut, strange people following their progress with their eyes] 
</p><p>Jack: [steps onto the landing] No worries, mates. Tia Dalma and I go way back. Thick as thieves. Nigh inseparable we are. Were. Have been. Before. 
</p><p>Gibbs: I’ll watch your back. 
</p><p>Jack: It’s me front I’m worried about. 
</p><p>Gibbs: [to Will] Mind the boat. 
</p><p>Will: [to Ragetti] Mind the boat. 
</p><p>Ragetti: [to Pintel] Mind the boat. 
</p><p>Pintel: [to Marty] Mind the boat. 
</p><p>Marty: [to Cotton and his parrot] Mind the boat. 
</p><p>Parrot: [to Cotton] Mind the boat. [and flies off] 
</p><p>[Jack cautiously creeps into Tia Dalma’s house] 
</p><p>Tia Dalma: Jack Sparrow. 
</p><p>Jack: Tia Dalma. [almost knocks his head against a hanging jar full of eyeballs] 
</p><p>Tia Dalma: I always knowed the wind was going to blow you back to me one day. [she approaches Jack, then spots Will and points to him] You. You have a touch a’ destiny about you. William. Turner. 
</p><p>Will: You know me? 
</p><p>Tia Dalma: You want to know me. [leans closer] 
</p><p>Jack: There’ll be no knowing here. [intervenes between them] We’ve come for help and we’re not leaving without it. [leads Tia Dalma away from Will] I thought I knew you. 
</p><p>Tia Dalma: Not so well as I’d hoped. [she heads to the back] Come. 
</p><p>Jack: Come. [motions Will over] 
</p><p>Tia Dalma: [caressing Will’s face] What service may I do ya? [forcefully, directed in Jack’s general direction] You know I demand payment. 
</p><p>Jack: I brought payment. [whistles for the cage to be brought closer; unveils it to show the monkey inside] Look… [shoots it] an undead monkey. Top that! 
</p><p>[Tia Dalma lets the monkey out and it runs to a low table] 
</p><p>Gibbs: No. [winces] You’ve no idea how long it took us to catch that. 
</p><p>Tia Dalma: The payment is fair. 
</p><p>Will: We’re looking for this. [lays out the drawing of a key] And what it goes to. 
</p><p>Tia Dalma: [to Jack] The compass you bartered from me, it cannot lead you to this? 
</p><p>Jack: Maybe. Why? 
</p><p>Tia Dalma: Aah. Jack Sparrow does not know what he wants. Or do you know but are loath to claim it as your own. Your key go to a chest. And it is what lay inside the chest you seek. Don’t it? 
</p><p>Gibbs: What is inside? 
</p><p>Pintel: Gold? Jewels? Unclaimed properties of valuable nature? 
</p><p>Ragetti: Nothing bad, I hope. 
</p><p>Tia Dalma: You know of Davy Jones, yes? [the Crew nods] A man of the sea. A great Sailor. Until he run afoul of that which vex all men. [Jack pockets something while no one’s looking] 
</p><p>Will: What vexes all men? 
</p><p>Tia Dalma: [she teasingly touches Will’s hand] What indeed. 
</p><p>Gibbs: The sea? 
</p><p>Pintel: Sums. 
</p><p>Ragetti: The dichotomy of good and evil. [Gibbs and Pintel give him a look] 
</p><p>Jack: A woman! 
</p><p>Tia Dalma: A woman. He fell in love. 
</p><p>Gibbs: No no no no, I heard it was the sea he fell in love with. 
</p><p>Tia Dalma: Same story, different version and all are true. See it was a woman as changing, and harsh and untamable as the sea. He never stopped loving her. But the pain it caused him was too much to live with. But not enough to cause him to die. 
</p><p>Will: What exactly did he put into the chest? 
</p><p>Tia Dalma: [puts hand upon her breast] Him heart. 
</p><p>Ragetti: Literally or figuratively? 
</p><p>Pintel: He couldn’t live, putting his heart in a chest. Could he? 
</p><p>Tia Dalma: It was not worth feeling what small, fleeting joy life brings. And so, him carved out him heart, lock it down in a chest, and hide the chest from the world. The key he keep with him at all times. 
</p><p>Will: [to Jack] You knew this. 
</p><p>Jack: I did not. I didn’t know where the key was. But now we do. So, all that’s left is to climb aboard the Flying Dutchman, grab the key, you go back to Port Royal and save your bonnie lass, aye? 
</p><p>Tia Dalma: [to Jack] Let me see your hand. [Jack wants to offer his unmarked right one, but knows better and gives her the one he has wrapped up; she undoes the makeshift bandages and everyone gets a look at the black spot on Jack’s palm] 
</p><p>Gibbs: [gasps] The black spot! [dusts himself off and spins around, spitting on the ground once he’s made a circle] The black spot. 
</p><p>Pintel and Ragetti: [follow Gibbs in his ritual] Black spot. 
</p><p>Jack: My eyesight’s as good as ever, just so you know. 
</p><p>Tia Dalma: [rummages around in the back of her hut, talking to herself; Jack steals another trinket from her; she returns with a jar in her arms] Davy Jones cannot make port. Cannot step on land but once every ten years. Land is where you Will be safe, Jack Sparrow, and so you Will carry land with you. [offers him the jar] 
</p><p>Jack: [takes it; a pause] Dirt. This is a jar of dirt. 
</p><p>Tia Dalma: Yes. 
</p><p>Jack: Is the… jar of dirt going to help? 
</p><p>Tia Dalma: If you don’t want it, give it back. 
</p><p>Jack: No. [clutches it close to his chest] 
</p><p>Tia Dalma: Then it helps. 
</p><p>Will: It seems… we have a need to find the Flying Dutchman. 
</p><p>Tia Dalma: A touch… [picks up random items she uses to scry and drops them on a table with something resembling a map drawn on it] of destiny.

SCENE 8: The Flying Dutchman and 99 souls 
</p><p>[at sea – a storm is in progress and we see a ship broken on the reefs] 
</p><p>Will: That’s the Flying Dutchman? [Gibbs nods] She doesn’t look like much. 
</p><p>Jack: Neither do you… do not underestimate it. [elbows Gibbs] 
</p><p>Gibbs: Must’ve run afoul of the reef. 
</p><p>Jack: What’s your plan? 
</p><p>Will: I row over, search the ship until I find your bloody key. 
</p><p>Jack: And if there are Crewmen? 
</p><p>Will: I cut down anyone in my path. [walks off] 
</p><p>Jack: I like it. Simple, easy to remember. 
</p><p>Ragetti: [Will climbs down to a tossing row boat] Your chariot awaits you. Ahahaha! 
</p><p>Jack: Oi! If you do have to get captured, just say Jack Sparrow sent you to settle his debt. Might save your life. 
</p><p>Ragetti: Move on out, ahahaha! [Will rows toward the landed ship] 
</p><p>Jack: [to the Crew] Douse the lamps. 
</p><p>[Will makes it to the ship and looks around, there is nothing but dead bodies until he spots a man frantically trying to raise sail and muttering to himself about Davy Jones] 
</p><p>Will: Sailor. Sailor! There’s no use, you’ve run aground. 
</p><p>Sailor: No, many of us, without a prayer. (??) 
</p><p>Will: [a body drops from the mast, the man crawls and lies still] Hey! Hey! [turns him over and starts, the man’s face in unrecognizable; that’s when the Flying Dutchman rears up out of the water, Sailors materializing out of the ship’s sides; they round up those left alive on the ship] 
</p><p>Undead Sailor: Go on your whereabouts and pray. 
</p><p>[when they wish to take Will, he fights them; his sword is dipped in oil and when he breaks his lantern with it, it lights up; the Undead pirates back away] 
</p><p>Will: Get back! Back! [when one is sliced open, fish comes splashing out of the wound; Will is distracted and ends up getting knocked on the head and fainting; there are 5 survivors, Will included, lined up in a row, waiting for Davy Jones; we hear his thudding step] 
</p><p>Hammer-head shark Pirate: Five men still alive, the rest have moved on. 
</p><p>Davy Jones: [crouches in front of the Sailor whimpering with fright and lights his pipe] Do you fear death? Do you fear that dark abyss? [the Sailor nods] All your deeds laid bare. All your sins punished. I can offer you an escape. 
</p><p>Sailor at the front of the row: Don’t listen to him! [he’s holding a crucifix in his hands, which are shaking badly] 
</p><p>Davy Jones: [steps up to him and grabs his throat with his clawed hand] Do you not fear death? 
</p><p>Sailor at the front of the row: I’ll take my chances, sir. 
</p><p>Davy Jones: To the depths. [a pirate steps behind him, slices that Sailors throat open and the body is thrown overboard] 
</p><p>Scared Sailor: Cold blood! 
</p><p>Davy Jones: Life is cruel. Why should the afterlife be any different? I offer you a choice. Join my Crew and postpone the judgment. One hundred years before the mast. [to one particular Sailor] Will ye serve? 
</p><p>Scared Sailor: I-I-I Will serve. 
</p><p>Davy Jones: That-a. [walks up to Will] You are neither dead nor dying. What is your purpose here? 
</p><p>Will: [cringes before replying, decides to say it] Jack Sparrow sent me to settle his debt. 
</p><p>Davy Jones: What is your purpose here? 
</p><p>Will: Jack Sparrow… sent me to settle his debt. 
</p><p>Davy Jones: Ha. Did he now? I’m sorely tempted to accept that offer. 
</p><p>[Jack spots Jones while looking through his telescope, when he lowers it, Jones is on the Pearl; the Crew gasps in fright and back as far away as they can; the dead pirates seizing them] 
</p><p>Jack: Oh. 
</p><p>Davy Jones: You have a debt to pay. [walks towards Jack and Jack backs away] You’ve been Captain of the Black Pearl for thirteen years. That was our agreement. 
</p><p>Jack: Technically, I was only Captain for two years, then I was viciously mutinied upon. 
</p><p>Davy Jones: Then you were a poor Captain, but a Captain nonetheless. Have you not introduced yourself all these years as ‘Captain Jack Sparrow’? [Jones’s Crew all laugh] 
</p><p>Jack: Yeah, I gave you payment. One soul to serve on your ship is already over there. [motions toward the Dutchman] 
</p><p>Davy Jones: One soul is not equal to another. 
</p><p>Jack: Aha! So we’ve establish my proposal is sound in principle, now we’re just haggling over price. 
</p><p>Davy Jones: Price? 
</p><p>Jack: Just how many souls, do you think, my soul is worth? 
</p><p>Davy Jones: One hundred souls. Three days. 
</p><p>Jack: You’re a darling, mate. Send me back the boy, I’ll get started right off. [walks away but is stopped by the Hammer-head shark Pirate] 
</p><p>Davy Jones: I keep the boy, a good, faith payment. That leaves you only ninety-nine to go. Haha, haha. 
</p><p>Jack: Have you not met Will Turner? He’s noble, heroic, a terrific soprano. Worth at least four, maybe three and a half. And did I happen to mention… he’s in love. With a girl. Due to be married. Betrothed. Dividing him from her and her from him would only be half as cruel as actually allowing them to be joined in holy matrimony. Aye? 
</p><p>Davy Jones: [a pause] I keep the boy. Ninty-nine souls-ah. But I wonder, Sparrow… can you live with this? Can you condemn an innocent man – a friend – to a lifetime of servitude in your name while you roam free? 
</p><p>Jack: [thinks a second] Yep. I’m good with it. Shall we seal it in blood, I mean, uh, ink? [Jones grabs Jack’s left hand with his tentacled one and “shakes on it”] Ah. 
</p><p>Davy Jones: Three days-ah. [his Crew echoes ‘Three days.’ and they disappear] 
</p><p>Jack: [looks at his slimy hand and sees the black spot disappear] Uh, Mr. Gibbs? 
</p><p>Gibbs: Aye. 
</p><p>Jack: I feel sullied and unusual. 
</p><p>Gibbs: And how do we intend to harvest these ninety-nine souls in three days? 
</p><p>Jack: Fortunately, he was mum as the condition in which these souls need be. 
</p><p>Gibbs: Aah, Tortuga. [Jack wipes his slimy hand on Gibbs’ vest] 
</p><p>Jack: Tortuga. 
</p><p>SCENE 9: Finding a Crew and Norrington in Tortuga 
</p><p>[on the ship Elizabeth stowed away on] Captain: It’s an outrage. [throws down papers] Port Tariff’s buried (??) in fees, war handling and, heaven help us, pilotage. Are we all to work for these India Trading Company, then? 
</p><p>Sailor #2: I’m afraid, sir… Tortuga is the only free post left in these waters. 
</p><p>Captain: A pirate port is what you mean. Well, I’m sorry, an honest Sailor is what I am and make my living fair and I sleep well each night, thank you. [Elizabeth’s wedding dress floats by outside the window] 
</p><p>Sailor #1: Sir! [points to the window; they press up against the window and gasp when the dress floats by once more and run outside; the dress hangs in mid-air] 
</p><p>Sailor: [we see Elizabeth controlling the dress’ movements, making it point] She wants you to do something. 
</p><p>Captain: She’s trying to give a sign. [the dress whooshes out over the sea then back at them and tips a lantern onto the deck where it breaks and a fire starts] Over there! Onto the side! [they rush to the other side of the ship] 
</p><p>Elizabeth: [sighs in exasperation, drops the dress and jumps down from her perch in the mast] 
</p><p>Sailor #2: Look, there! There it is! There’s the sign. [points out into the water] 
</p><p>Sailor #3: I seen it. 
</p><p>Sailor #2: So we can be saved. Looks like entrails. 
</p><p>Captain: That’d be a bad sign. 
</p><p>Elizabeth: [plops down on an upright barrel] What’s that over there? [the Crew moves towards her; the fire from the lantern spells out ‘Tortuga’] 
</p><p>[on Tortuga the population is as disorderly and loud as before] 
</p><p>Gibbs: [is sitting at a table, trying to find ninety-nine souls Willing to sail on the Black Pearl] And what makes you think you’re worthy to Crew the Black Pearl? 
</p><p>Sailor hopeful #1: Truth be told, I never sailed a day in me life. I figure I should get out and see the world while I’m still young. 
</p><p>Gibbs: You’ll do. Make your mark. [indicates the roster sheet] Next! 
</p><p>Sailor hopeful #2: My wife run off with my dog, and I’m drunk for a month, and I don’t give an ass rat’s if I live or die. 
</p><p>Gibbs: Perfect! Next! 
</p><p>Jack: [holds the compass and mutters to himself] I know what I want, I know what I want, I know what I want. [opens the compass and it still won’t show him his bearing] 
</p><p>Sailor hopeful #3: Me have one arm and a bum leg. 
</p><p>Gibbs: It’s the crow’s nest for you. 
</p><p>Jack: I know what I want. [opens the compass and still nothing] 
</p><p>Gibbs: Next! 
</p><p>Sailor hopeful #4: Ever since I was little, I’ve always wanted to sail the seas. Forever. 
</p><p>Gibbs: Sooner than you think. Sign the roster. 
</p><p>Sailor hopeful #4: Thanks very much. 
</p><p>Jack: How are we going? 
</p><p>Gibbs: Including those four? That gives us… four. [Jack shakes the compass vigorously; another hopeful comes up] And what’s your story? 
</p><p>Norrington: My story? [Gibbs nods] It’s exactly the same as your story, just one chapter behind. I chased a man across the seven seas. [Jack closes his compass and looks around for a spot to hide in] The pursuit cost me my Crew, my commission, and my life. [grabs a rum bottle down off the table, takes a swig; Norrington looks scruffy, dirty, and very much unlike himself] 
</p><p>Gibbs: Commodore? 
</p><p>Norrington: No, not anymore, weren’t you listening? [Gibbs looks uncomfortable] I nearly had you all off Tripoli. I would’ve, if not for the hurricane. [Jack takes a leafy plant and hides behind it] 
</p><p>Gibbs: Lord. You didn’t try to sail through it? 
</p><p>Norrington: So do I make your Crew or not? You haven’t said where you’re going. Somewhere nice! [upturns the table and Gibbs falls off his stool, then starts strutting around the tavern] So am I worthy to serve under Captain Jack Sparrow? [Jack tries to inconspicuously walk away with the plant clutched in front, Norrington spots him anyway and points his pistol at him] Or should I just kill you now? 
</p><p>Jack: You’re hired. 
</p><p>Norrington: Sorry. Old habits and all that. [is ready to shoot when two pirates raise his pistol hand to the ceiling] 
</p><p>Pirate: Easy Sailor! [the pistol fires and the bullet ricochets off the lights and breaks someone’s bottle; a brawl breaks out] 
</p><p>Jack: Time to go. 
</p><p>Gibbs: Aye. [they carefully make their way upstairs] 
</p><p>[Elizabeth spots Norrington and helps him fight off his attackers; Norrington keeps on drinking] 
</p><p>Jack: [Jack keeps trying on different hats, but not one seems to suit him well enough; takes another] Thanks, mate. [touches the pirate’s shoulder and the man falls off his perch on the railing] Ooh. [puts the hat he took off him onto another being carried off to be thrown off the second floor, steps aside] Carry on. [the man is thrown over] 
</p><p>Norrington: [surrounded by unfriendly swords, Elizabeth at his back] Come on, then! Who wants some? For my lordly line, I’ll have you one by one. Come on, who’s first? 
</p><p>Elizabeth: [grabs the bottle in Norrington’s hand and smashes it over his head] I just wanted the pleasure of doing that myself. [the rest cheer; they heave him out into the pig pen and leave cheerfully; Mr. Mercer, Beckett’s man, is standing in the doorway watching; Elizabeth helps Norrington get himself out of the muck] James Norrington. [sighs] What has the world done to you? 
</p><p>SCENE 10: Will meets his father 
</p><p>[on the Flying Dutchman Davy Jones is playing an organ with his tentacles] 
</p><p>Crew: [hoist a cannon down] Heave! Heave! Heave! 
</p><p>Undead pirate: Secure the mast, man called Mr. Turner. Secure it! [both Will and Bootstrap rush off] 
</p><p>Will: Step aside! 
</p><p>Bootstrap: Hey, mind yourself! Let go, boy! [finally looks at Will and cannot look away] No. [they both let go of the rope, Will hanging on futilely, and the cannon smashes onto the deck] 
</p><p>Boatswain: [pointing Will out] Haul that weasel to his feet. [Will is pulled to his feet, made to grad onto the ropes holding the sail] Five lashes are in my due. To stay honor. 
</p><p>Bootstrap: [stops his arm] No. 
</p><p>Boatswain: Impeding me in my duties? You’ll share the punishment. 
</p><p>Bootstrap: I’ll take it all. 
</p><p>Davy Jones: Will you now? And what would prompt such an act of charity? 
</p><p>Bootstrap: [he hesitates] My son. He’s my son. [Will turns to look at his father] 
</p><p>Davy Jones: [looks at the father than the son] Ahahaha ha! What fortuitous circumstance be this. Five lashes be owed, I believe it is. [reaches out his hand for the whip, which is handed over, then offers it to Bootstrap] 
</p><p>Bootstrap: No. No, I won’t! 
</p><p>Davy Jones: The cat’s out of the bag, Mr. Turner. Your issue Will feel its sting be it at the Bo’sun’s hand or your own. 
</p><p>Bootstrap: [looks at his struggling son] No. 
</p><p>Davy Jones: Bo’sun! [is ready to hand the whip to him] 
</p><p>Bootstrap: No! [snatches the whip out of Jones’s hand; Will’s shirt is ripped across his back and Bootstrap delivers the five lashes] 
</p><p>[Will is dropped down the stairs into the hold, back covered in a crisscrossing of bloody lash marks] 
</p><p>Undead pirate: You’ve had it easy boy. 
</p><p>Bootstrap: Will! [tries to help him] 
</p><p>Will: I don’t need your help. [pushes his father’s arm away] 
</p><p>Bootstrap: The Bo’sun prides himself on cleaving flesh from bone with every swing. 
</p><p>Will: So I’m to understand what you did was an act of compassion. 
</p><p>Bootstrap: Yes. [Will’s anger fades; they walk on deck] One hundred years before the mast. Loosing who you are, bit by bit. ‘Till you end up, end up like poor, Wyvern, here. [points to a pirate who’s become part of the hull] Once you’ve sworn an oath to the Dutchman, there’s no leaving it. Not until your debt is paid. 
</p><p>Will: I’ve sworn no oath. 
</p><p>Bootstrap: Then you must get away. 
</p><p>Will: [takes out the drawing of a key from his pocket; softly] Not until I find this. [unfolds the cloth] The key. 
</p><p>Whidden: [separates himself a little from the hull] The Dead Man’s Chest. 
</p><p>Will: What do you know of it? 
</p><p>Wyvern: Open the chest with the key and stab the heart. No, don’t stab the heart. The Dutchman needs a living heart or there’ll be no Captain. If there’s no Captain, thereâ€™s no one to have the key. 
</p><p>Will: So the Captain has the key. [Wyvern plays mum] Where is the key? 
</p><p>Wyvern: Hidden. 
</p><p>Will: Where is the chest. 
</p><p>Wyvern: Hidden. [attaches himself back to the hull] 
</p><p>SCENE 11: The Pearl gets a heading and Beckett negotiates 
</p><p>[in Tortuga, Elizabeth follows Jack to the Pearl, still dressed as a boy] 
</p><p>Elizabeth: Captain Sparrow? 
</p><p>Jack: Come to join me Crew, lad? Welcome aboard. 
</p><p>Elizabeth: I’m here to find the man I love. 
</p><p>Jack: I’m deeply flattered, son, but my first and only love is the sea. [Jack looks alarmed and indicates to Gibbs to get the ‘lad’ away from them; Norrington throws up into the bay] 
</p><p>Elizabeth: Meaning William Turner, Captain Sparrow. 
</p><p>Jack: [finally turns all the way around] Elizabeth? [turns to Gibbs] Hide the rum. [Gibbs takes the bottle from his hand and walks onto the ship] You know these clothes do not flatter you at all. It should be a dress or nothing. I happen to have no dress in my cabin. 
</p><p>Elizabeth: Jack. I know Will came to find you, where is he? 
</p><p>Jack: Darling, I am truly unhappy to have to tell you this, but through an unfortunate and entirely unforeseeable series of circumstances that had nothing whatsoever to do with me, poor Will has been press-ganged into Davy Jones’s Crew. 
</p><p>Elizabeth: Davy Jones? 
</p><p>Norrington: [still throwing up] Oh, please. The Captain of the Flying Dutchman? 
</p><p>Jack: You look bloody awful, what are you doing here? 
</p><p>Norrington: You hired me. I can’t help it, if your standards are lax. 
</p><p>Jack: You smell funny. 
</p><p>Elizabeth: Jack! 
</p><p>Jack: Hmm. 
</p><p>Elizabeth: All I want is to find Will. 
</p><p>Jack: Are you certain? Is that what you really want most? 
</p><p>Elizabeth: Of course. 
</p><p>Jack: [puts his hand onto her back and leads her to the side] Because I would think, you’d want to find a way to save Will most. 
</p><p>Elizabeth: And you’d have a way of doing that? 
</p><p>Jack: Well, there is a chest. 
</p><p>Norrington: Oh, dear. 
</p><p>Jack: A chest of unknown size and origin. 
</p><p>Pintel: What contains the still beating heart of Davy Jones. [Ragetti imitates a still beating heart after it has been torn out] 
</p><p>Jack: And whoever possesses that chest, possesses the leverage to command Jones to do whatever it is he or she wants. Including saving brave William from his grim fate. 
</p><p>Norrington: You don’t actually believe him, do you? 
</p><p>Elizabeth: [it appears that Elizabeth does] How do we find it? 
</p><p>Jack: With this. [holds up his compass] My compass… is unique. 
</p><p>Norrington: Unique, here, having the meaning of broken. 
</p><p>Jack: True enough. [Norrington walks off to throw up some more] This compass does not point north. 
</p><p>Elizabeth: Where does it point? 
</p><p>Jack: It points to the thing you want most in this world. 
</p><p>Elizabeth: Jack. [shakes her head] Are you telling the truth? 
</p><p>Jack: Every word, love. And what you want most in this world… [places the compass in her hands] is to find the chest of Davy Jones, is it not? 
</p><p>Elizabeth: To save Will. 
</p><p>Jack: By finding the chest of Davy Jones. [opens the compass and briskly steps away; the needle spins before finally stopping resolutely; Jack peers up cautiously to get the coordinates] Mr. Gibbs! 
</p><p>Gibbs: Cap’n? 
</p><p>Jack: We have our heading. 
</p><p>Gibbs: Finally! Cast off those lines, weigh anchor, and trough that canvas! 
</p><p>Jack: [with a sweep of his arm invites Elizabeth on board] Ms. Swann. [Norrington, swaying, follows] 
</p><p>Ragetti: Welcome to the Crew, former Commodore. [shoves a goat into his arms] 
</p><p>[in Port Royal, the map of the world is still being painted] 
</p><p>Beckett: [unsheathes what used to be Norrington’s sword] There’s something to knowing the exact shape of the world and man’s place in it. Don’t you agree? 
</p><p>Swann: [without his wig, looking bedraggled and in chains] I assure you… [holds out his chained hands] these are not necessary. 
</p><p>Beckett: I had you brought here because I thought you’d be interested in the whereabouts of your daughter. 
</p><p>Swann: You have news of her? 
</p><p>Mercer: Most recently seen on the island of Tortuga. The left in the company of the known pirate, Jack Sparrow, and other fugitives from justice. 
</p><p>Swann: Justice? Hardly. 
</p><p>Beckett: Including the previous owner of this sword. [sheathes it] I believe. Our ships are in pursuit and justice Will be dispensed by cannonade and cutlass and all manner of remorseless pieces of metal. I personally find it distasteful to even contemplate the horror facing all those on board. [looks pointedly as Swann] 
</p><p>Swann: What do you want from me? 
</p><p>Beckett: Your authority as Governor, your influence in London, and your loyalty to the East India Trading Company. 
</p><p>Swann: [scoffs softly] To you, you mean. 
</p><p>Beckett: [walks up to Swann] Shall I remove these shackles? 
</p><p>Swann: Do what you can for my daughter. [with a glance from Beckett, the chains are unlocked] 
</p><p>Beckett: So you see, Mercer, every man has a price which he Will Willingly accept. Even for what he hoped never to sell. 
</p><p>SCENE 12: Waging years of service 
</p><p>[on the Flying Dutchman- the Crew is swabbing the deck, and a few are playing a strange game involving dice] 
</p><p>Hammer-head shark Pirate: [placing bets on the dice game] I wager ten years. 
</p><p>Undead pirate #1: I match the wager. 
</p><p>Undead pirate #3: Agreed. 
</p><p>Bootstrap: [walks up behind Will who is watching the game] Wondering how it’s played? 
</p><p>Will: I understand. It’s a game of deception. The game includes all the dice, not just your own. What are they waging? 
</p><p>Bootstrap: The only thing we have: years of service. 
</p><p>Will: So any Crew member can be challenged? 
</p><p>Bootstrap: Aye, anyone. 
</p><p>Will: I challenge Davy Jones. [the Crew stops to stare at him; Bootstrap is about to say something to him when they hear Jones’s thudding step] 
</p><p>Davy Jones: I accept. [a low table and stools are brought up, the dice laid out on the table top] The stakes? 
</p><p>Will: My soul. An eternity of servitude. 
</p><p>Bootstrap: No! 
</p><p>Davy Jones: Against? 
</p><p>Will: I want this. [lays the rolled up drawing of a key on the table] 
</p><p>Davy Jones: [picks up the cloth, looks at it and is taken aback; the Crew mutter amongst themselves] How do you know the key? 
</p><p>Will: That’s not part of the game, is it? [sits down at the table] You can still walk away. 
</p><p>Davy Jones: [sits down, takes the key out from under his tentacles and dangles it in front of Will to show him that he does indeed have the key; they shake their dice and thud them down on the table, another hand joins in unexpectedly – it is Bootstrap] What’s this? 
</p><p>Bootstrap: I’m in, matching his wager. 
</p><p>Will: No. Don’t do this. 
</p><p>Bootstrap: Die’s cast. I bet three two’s. It’s your bid, Captain. 
</p><p>Davy Jones: Four four’s. 
</p><p>Will: Four five’s. 
</p><p>Bootstrap: Six three’s. 
</p><p>Davy Jones: [we see that he has five five’s] Seven five’s. 
</p><p>[unknown to Will, he has three five’s, Bootstrap has two three’s and three two’s] 
</p><p>Will: Eight five’s. 
</p><p>Davy Jones: Hehehe, welcome to the Crew, lad. 
</p><p>Bootstrap: Twelve five’s. [Davy Jones stares at him] Twelve five’s. Call me a liar, I upped the bid. 
</p><p>Davy Jones: And be called a liar myself for my trouble. [reveals all the dice] Bootstrap Bill, you’re a liar and you Will spend an eternity on this ship. [to Will] Master Turner, feel free to go ashore. The minute the next time we make port. [laughs, the Crew laughs with him and the leave the pair] 
</p><p>Will: Fool. Why did you do that? 
</p><p>Bootstrap: Because you’d lose. 
</p><p>Will: It was never about winning or losing. 
</p><p>Bootstrap: The key… you just wanted to know where it was. 
</p><p>[the Crew is mostly asleep] Bootstrap: [walks up to the one at the helm] Captain says I’m to relieve you. [the pirate cocks his head inquiringly] Captain’s orders. 
</p><p>[meanwhile, Will creeps into Davy Jones’s cabin where Jones is sleeping at the organ; with a quill and a stick, Will raises up a few tentacles and tries to navigate under them to get at the key; he drops a tentacle on the keys and as Jones is about to wake up, a music locket opens and plays a soothing tune; Will manages to get the key and put the drawing of it its place; Will walks out on deck and puts the key around his neck and his bag over his shoulder] 
</p><p>Bootstrap: Here. [hands Will a knife] Take this, too. Now get yourself to land and stay there. It was always in my blood to die at sea. 
</p><p>Will: [takes it and unsheathes it] It’s not a fate you had to choose for yourself either. 
</p><p>Bootstrap: I… I could say I did what I had to when I left you to go pirating. But it would taste a lie to say it wasn’t what I wanted. You owe me nothing. Now, go. 
</p><p>Will: They’ll know you helped me. 
</p><p>Bootstrap: [laughs] What more can they do to me? 
</p><p>Will: [holds up the knife] I take this with a promise, I’ll find a way to sever Jones’s hold on you and not rest ‘till this blade pierces his heart. I Will not abandon you. [a pause] I promise. 
</p><p>SCENE 13: Persuasion and the Kraken 
</p><p>[on the Black Pearl, the Crew is swabbing the desk as well] 
</p><p>Jack: Beckett. 
</p><p>Elizabeth: Yes, they’re signed ‘Lord Cutler Beckett of the East India Trading Company.’ 
</p><p>Jack: [holds the Letters of Marque closer to study the signature] Euhh. [sticks tongue out] 
</p><p>Gibbs: Will was working for Beckett and never said a word. 
</p><p>Jack: Ah. 
</p><p>Gibbs: Beckett wants the compass. Only one reason for that. 
</p><p>Jack: Of course. He wants the chest. 
</p><p>Elizabeth: Yes, he did say something about a chest. 
</p><p>Gibbs: If the Company controls the chest, they control the sea. 
</p><p>Jack: A truly discomforting notion, love. 
</p><p>Gibbs: Baaad! Bad for every mother’s son what calls himself pirate. I think there’s a bit more speed to be coaxed from these sails. [walks off to see to the sails] Brace the foreyard! 
</p><p>Jack: Might I enquire as to how you came by these. [holds up the Letters of Marque] 
</p><p>Elizabeth: Persuasion. 
</p><p>Jack: Friendly? 
</p><p>Elizabeth: Decidedly not. 
</p><p>Jack: Will strikes a deal for these and upholds it with honor, yet you are the one standing here with the prize. [reads] “Full pardon, commissioned as a privateer on behalf of England and the East India Trading Company…” [Norrington overhears this; Jack puts the letters away] As if I could be bought for such a low price. 
</p><p>Elizabeth: Jack, the letters, give them back. 
</p><p>Jack: No. Persuade me. 
</p><p>Elizabeth: [comes up behind him and leans in] You do know Will taught me how to handle a sword. 
</p><p>Jack: [turns to face her] As I said… persuade me. [Elizabeth walks away] 
</p><p>Norrington: [walks up to Elizabeth standing at the ship’s rail with a smile on her lips] It’s a curious thing, there was a time I would give anything for you to look like that while thinking about me. 
</p><p>Elizabeth: I don’t know what you mean. 
</p><p>Norrington: Oh, I think you do. 
</p><p>Elizabeth: Oh, don’t be absurd, I trust him, that’s all. 
</p><p>Norrington: [laughs and walks away before turning back for another word] So you never wondered how your latest fiancÃ© ended up on the Flying Dutchman in the first place. [shakes his head and continues walking] 
</p><p>[Elizabeth takes out the compass and opens it; its direction changes to point to Jack; she shakes her head and closes the compass, looking a little disturbed] 
</p><p>[on the ship that had taken Elizabeth to Tortuga; Will is sitting with a blanket around his shoulders and a hot cup in his hands] Captain: Strange thing, to come upon a long boat so far out in open water. 
</p><p>Will: Just put as many leagues behind us as you can. As fast as you can. 
</p><p>Captain: And what are we running from? 
</p><p>Will: [spots Elizabeth’s wedding dress draped on a chair; walks to it] That dress… where did you get it? 
</p><p>Captain: It was found aboard this ship. The Crew thought it was a spirit bringing some omen of ill fate. 
</p><p>Will: [picks up the dress lovingly] That’s foolish. 
</p><p>Sailor #2: Ah, yes, exceedingly foolish. 
</p><p>Sailor #1: It brought good fortune. The spirit told us… pull in at Tortuga. And we made a nice bit of profit there. 
</p><p>Captain: Off the books, of course. 
</p><p>Will: I imagine… some of your Crew may have jumped ship there. 
</p><p>Captain: Why do you ask? 
</p><p>Sailor: [runs down into the cabin] Captain, a ship’s been spotted. 
</p><p>Captain: Colors? 
</p><p>Sailor: She isn’t flying any. 
</p><p>Captain: Pirates! 
</p><p>Will: Or worse. 
</p><p>[on the Flying Dutchman – Davy Jones has discovered the ruse and is holding the drawing of his key in his hand] 
</p><p>Davy Jones: [grabs Bootstrap by his throat, the ship with Will on board in their sight] You Will watch this. [a few of the Crew are cranking a wheel and being lashed while doing so] Let no joyful voice be heard. Let no man look up at the sky with hope. And let this day be cursed by we who ready to raise… the Kraken! 
</p><p>Bootstrap: Nooooo! [is held back by a few of the pirates; the crank booms as it crashes down once it reaches maximum capacity and the boom spreads through the water, calling the Kraken] 
</p><p>[there is a commotion on the ship and everyone comes out to see the Fling Dutchman] 
</p><p>Will: I have doomed us all. It’s the Flying Dutchman! [the ship shudders from a blow and Will falls out of the crow’s nest, hanging by a line; the Crew flops down as well] 
</p><p>Sailor #1: Mother Clarice’s chickens, what happened? 
</p><p>Sailor #2: Must’ve hit a reef. 
</p><p>Captain: [water is bubbling on the side of the ship] Reel the rudder, help the port the—(??) starboard. 
</p><p>Sailor #4: Reel in rudder! 
</p><p>Sailor #5: Help the port! [the Captain is snatched by a tentacle clean off the ship; then he reappears briefly, screaming, and is pulled underwater] 
</p><p>Sailor #4: Kraken! [there is mayhem on board; the tentacles of the Kraken creeping up the sides and snatching Sailors off the deck; Will slides down a sail with the help of his knife once the mast he’s on collapses; the ship is cracked in two and dragged down in a slimy embrace; Will survives and slings to a piece of the deck floating on the water, the Flying Dutchman coming up alongside the wreckage; Elizabeth’s dress floats on the water] 
</p><p>Hammer-head shark Pirate: The boy’s not here, he must’ve been claimed by the sea. 
</p><p>Davy Jones: I am the sea. [walks up to Bootstrap] You need time alone with your thoughts. Brig! 
</p><p>Hammer-head shark Pirate: What of the survivors? [they are lined up as before; Will peaks in, clinging to the side of the ship] 
</p><p>Davy Jones: There are no survivors. [the survivors are killed; Davy Jones senses Will’s presence and goes to investigate, but Will cannot be seen] The chest is no longer safe, chart a course to Isla Cruces. Get me there first or it’ll be the devil to pay. 
</p><p>Blowfish headed pirate: First? 
</p><p>Davy Jones: Who’s shoved that thieving charlatan onto my ship. Who told them of the key? Jack Sparrow. [Will is riding in the open mouth at the bow of the ship; Elizabeth’s dress sinks into the sea] 
</p><p>SCENE 14: A good man and the pursuit 
</p><p>[on the Black Pearl; Elizabeth is sitting on the stairs where Jack joins her] 
</p><p>Jack: My tremendous intuitive sense of the female creature informs me that you are… troubled. 
</p><p>Elizabeth: I just thought Iâ€™d be married by now. I’m so ready to be married. 
</p><p>Jack: [Jack pops open a bottle of rum, hands it to her and she takes a drink, looking upset] You know… [clears throat] Lizzie, I am Captain of a ship and being Captain of a ship I could, in fact, perform a marriage right here. Right on this deck. Rightâ€¦ now. 
</p><p>Elizabeth: [Elizabeth looks even more disgusted, hands him the bottle and walks away] No, thank you. 
</p><p>Jack: [follows her] Why not? We are very much alike you and I. I and you… us. 
</p><p>Elizabeth: Except for a sense of honor and decency and a moral center. And personal hygiene. 
</p><p>Jack: Trifles. You Will come over to my side, I know it. 
</p><p>Elizabeth: You seem very certain. 
</p><p>Jack: One word, love: curiosity. You long for freedom. You long to do what you want to do because you want it. To act on selfish impulse. You want to see what it’s like. One day… you won’t be able to resist. 
</p><p>Elizabeth: Why doesn’t your compass work? 
</p><p>Jack: My compass works fine. 
</p><p>Elizabeth: Because you and I are alike. And there Will come a moment when you have a chance to show it. To do the right thing. 
</p><p>Jack: I love those moments. I like to wave at them as they pass by. 
</p><p>Elizabeth: You’ll have the chance to do something… something courageous. And when you, you’ll discover something. That you’re a good man. 
</p><p>Jack: All evidence to the contrary. 
</p><p>Elizabeth: [laughs] No, I have faith in you. You want to know why? 
</p><p>Jack: Do tell, dearie. 
</p><p>Elizabeth: [leans in close with each sentence] Curiosity. You’re going to want it – a chance to be admired – and gain the rewards that follow. You won’t be able to resist. You’re going to want to know what it tastes like. 
</p><p>Jack: I do want to know what it tastes like. 
</p><p>Elizabeth: [Jack caresses her cheek] But seeing as you’re a good man, I know that you’d never put me in a position that would compromise my honor. [Jack is ready to kiss her when he sees the black mark return to the palm of his hand and snatches his hand away] I’m proud of you, Jack. 
</p><p>Gibbs: Land-ho! 
</p><p>Jack: I need my jar of dirt. [goes to look for it] 
</p><p>Pintel: [Ragetti and Pintel are rowing the boat with Jack and his jar of dirt in it, Norrington at the prow] You’re pulling too fast. 
</p><p>Ragetti: You’re pulling too slow. 
</p><p>Pintel: We don’t want the Kraken to catch us. I’m saving me strength for when it comes. Just donâ€™t think it’s Kraken, anyways. Always heard it says Kray-ken. 
</p><p>Ragetti: What with the long ‘a’? 
</p><p>Pintel: Aha. 
</p><p>Ragetti: No no no no no. “Kroken”’s how it’s pronounced in the original Scandinavian, and “Kraken”’s closer to that. 
</p><p>Pintel: Well, we ain’t original Scandinavians, are we? Kray-ken. 
</p><p>Ragetti: It’s a mythological creature; I can calls it what I wants! 
</p><p>Jack: [puts his coat in the boat and picks up a shovel] Guard the boat; mind the tides… don’t touch my dirt. 
</p><p>[Norrington and Jack follow Elizabeth across the island as she leads them with the compass] 
</p><p>Elizabeth: [starts walking in circles; the compass needle points to Jack once more and she shakes it] This doesn’t work. And it certainly doesn’t show you what you want most. [she sits down cross-legged on the sand] 
</p><p>Jack: [walks over and looks at the compass] Yes, it does, you’re sitting on it. 
</p><p>Elizabeth: Beg pardon? 
</p><p>Jack: [shoos her off] Move. [whistles to Norrington to start digging] 
</p><p>Pintel: Guard the boat, mind the tide… 
</p><p>Ragetti: [balancing the shovel on his hand] I can join the circus. 
</p><p>Pintel: Mind if I shine your shoes, sir? [they are seen by Davy Jones through his telescope] 
</p><p>Davy Jones: They’re here. And I cannot set foot on land for near of a decade. 
</p><p>Hammer-head shark Pirate: Trust us to act in your stead? 
</p><p>Davy Jones: I’ll trust you to know what awaits you should you fail! Down then. [the Crew shouts; Ragetti and Pintel run when they hear the thud of the Flying Dutchman descending below the water] 
</p><p>SCENE 15: The fight over the chest and the key 
</p><p>[Jack is meditating while Norrington digs, suddenly he hits something solid, they all look down into the hole; the sand is swept off the wooden chest holding the actual chest and Jack breaks it open; on top lie letters and under them, the chest of Davy Jones; they out their ears to it and it thumps] 
</p><p>Elizabeth: It’s real. 
</p><p>Norrington: You actually were telling the truth. 
</p><p>Jack: I do that quite a lot, yet people are still surprised. 
</p><p>Will: [walks up to them] With good reason. 
</p><p>Elizabeth: Will. [runs to him] You’re alright, thank God! I came to find you. [they kiss while Norrington and Jack watch jealously out of the corner of their eye] 
</p><p>Jack: How did you get here? 
</p><p>Will: Sea turtles, mate. A pair of them strapped to my feet. 
</p><p>Jack: Not so easy is it? 
</p><p>Will: But I do owe you thanks, Jack. 
</p><p>Jack: You do? 
</p><p>Will: After you tricked me onto that ship, to square your debt with Jones. 
</p><p>Elizabeth: What? 
</p><p>Jack: [in a high-pitched tone of voice] What? 
</p><p>Will: I was reunited with my father. 
</p><p>Jack: Oh, well, you’re welcome, then. 
</p><p>Elizabeth: Everything you said to me, every word was a lie! 
</p><p>Jack: Pretty much. Time and tide, love. [Will unsheathes his father’s knife and kneels next to the chest] Oi, what are you doing? 
</p><p>Will: I’m gonna kill Jones. [Jack takes out his sword and levels it at him] 
</p><p>Jack: Can’t let you do that, William. ‘Cause if Jones is dead, who’s to call his terrible beastie off the hunt, eh? [Will looks like he’s relented and stand up, key still in hand] Now, if you please. [Jack reaches out for the key] The key. 
</p><p>Will: [snatches Elizabeth’s sword from her] I keep the promises I make, Jack. I intend to free my father. And I hope you’re here to see it. 
</p><p>Norrington: [takes his own sword out and points it at Will] I can’t let you do that, either. So sorry. 
</p><p>Jack: I knew you’d warm up to me eventually. 
</p><p>Norrington: [swings his sword ‘round to Jack; Will now turns his to Norrington – they form a triangle] Lord Beckett desires the contents of that chest. I deliver it: I get my life back. 
</p><p>Jack: Ah. The dark side of ambition. 
</p><p>Norrington: Oh, I prefer to see it as the promise of redemption. [they start fighting each other] 
</p><p>Elizabeth: Stop it! [she is ignored; Will falls] Will! [she kneels to help him up] 
</p><p>Will: Guard the chest. [runs after the two fighting] 
</p><p>Elizabeth: No! [runs after them; she goes on a tirade while they ignore her and instead fight each other] This is not funny! This is no way for grown men to – Oh, fine! Let’s just pull out our swords and start banging away at each other, that’s all there ever is. I’ve had it! I’ve had it with wobbly-legged, rum-soaked pirates! [doesn’t notice Pintel and Ragetti just behind her] 
</p><p>Pintel: [watching Norrington, Will and Jack fight and Elizabeth throwing rocks at them] How’d this go all sCrewy? 
</p><p>Ragetti: Well, each wants the chest for hisself, don’t ‘e? Mr. Norrington, I think, is trying to regain a bit of honor. Ol’ Jack’s looking to trade it, save his own skin. And Turner there – I think ‘e’s trying to settle some unresolved business twixt him and his twice-cursed pirate father. 
</p><p>Elizabeth: [in the distance] This is madness! 
</p><p>Pintel: Sad. [Ragetti nods] That chest must be worth more than a shiny penny. 
</p><p>Ragetti: [tsk’s] Terrible temptation. 
</p><p>Pintel: If we was any kind of decent, we’d remove temptation from their path. [they look at each other, laugh and go off to get the chest] 
</p><p>Elizabeth: [still throwing rocks] Enough! Oh. Oh! The heat. [pretends to faint, they continue to ignore her; she sits up and finally spots Ragetti and Pintel making off with the chest; runs after them] 
</p><p>Jack: [falls] Bugger. [gets the key and runs off, the two following still fighting] 
</p><p>Norrington: [pulls Will back and Will falls, then kicks sand in Will’s face] By your leave, Mr. Turner. [mock-bows before him and goes after Jack] 
</p><p>[on the beach, Jones’s pirates are surfacing; they shamble up to the chest and find it gone] 
</p><p>[Norrington is in pursuit of Jack; they fight up the stairs of what used to be a mill; Norrington gets the key and Jack looses his balance and grabs a bell-rope, so he goes down and Will, who’s caught up, goes up and grabs the key from Norrington] 
</p><p>Will: [lands on the top-most level] By your leave, Mr. Norrington. [Norrington takes off after him] 
</p><p>[the Undead pirates on the beach come up to the chest at the precise moment that the bell starts tolling, and figuring that’s where the chest must’ve gone, follow the bell] 
</p><p>[Will and Norrington take their fight outside, Jack following with a cautious step after them at a leisurely pace; Will has the key in the hand not holding his sword and Jack tries to catch it, but as Will is still fighting, it is a little difficult; once he has it, the two turn on him] 
</p><p>Norrington: [Jack is disarmed; to Will] Do excuse me while I kill the man who ruined my life. 
</p><p>Will: Be my guest. 
</p><p>Jack: Let us examine that claim for a moment, former Commodore, shall we? Who was it that at the very moment you had a notorious pirate safely behind bars saw fit to free said pirate and take your dearly beloved all to hisself… aye? So whose fault is it really that you’ve ended up a rum-pot deckhand what takes orders from pirates? 
</p><p>Norrington: Enough! [takes a swipe at Jack who somersaults off the roof and safely lands on the ground] Unfortunately, Mr. Turner… he’s right! [turns on Will] 
</p><p>Jack: [finds his sword and sheathes it] Still rooting for you, mate. [jauntily walks off with the key now around his neck; doesn’t watch where he’s going and falls face first into an empty grave] Oof. [looks around in confusion, it dawns on him where he is] Oh. 
</p><p>[Will jumps off onto a wheel usually used to power mills, Norrington follows; under the weight of their jump, the rotting wood give and the wheel starts rolling; just as Jack tries to hoist himself out of the grave, the wheel rolls over him and his mid-drift gets stuck in it; as the wheel makes a turn, the key slides off Jack’s neck and snags on a nail; the fight is paused for a moment as Norrington and Will have to step around Jack’s protruding legs; Jack slides free and runs for a moment inside the wheel before he is knocked out by a metal bar] 
</p><p>Pintel: [running through the jungle with the chest] We’ve got it! [Elizabeth steps in their path and reaches for a sword that isn’t there; Ragetti and Pintel take out theirs] ‘Ello, poppet. [they pause to stare at the giant wheel rolling by with Norrington and Will still sword-fighting, Jack in close pursuit behind them; they shrug and continue to advance on Elizabeth; that’s when a hatchet thuds into the nearest tree trunk, Davy Jones’s Crew coming upon them; Elizabeth gets the swords handed to her and Ragetti and Pintel shag up the chest; all three make a run for it; the chest meets a tree and is dropped, to protect it, Elizabeth steps into a fight] 
</p><p>[Jack finally catches up with the wheel and decided to have another go at running on the inside; before the key reaches him, Will falls and seeing the key right under him, snatches it; he now fight with Jack, Norrington joining them soon after] 
</p><p>[being one sword short, Elizabeth, Ragetti and Pintel have to share while they fight the Undead pirates] 
</p><p>Elizabeth: Sword! [Ragetti tosses her his sword] 
</p><p>Pintel: Sword! [Elizabeth tosses him her sword] 
</p><p>Ragetti: Sword! [catches the sword, fights a bit; a Conch-headed pirate sees the chest unattended and takes it chuckling] 
</p><p>[Jack manages to break the string the key was attached to and having got his prize, leaves the wheel quickly, latching onto a palm tree; just in time, too, as the wheel rolls off a slope; when the leaf he’s holding breaks off, he lands on the ground along with a few solid looking fruit; he sees the pirate rushing through the trees with the chest in hand] 
</p><p>Jack: Hmm. [hefts one of the fruit and throws it at the pirate; the throw knocks the pirate off his feet and consequently knocks his head off] 
</p><p>Conch-head: Anido. Anido! Follow my voice, follow my voice! [the body stumbles around; Jack takes advantage and walks up to the chest with the key] To the left. No! Other left. Go… [the body walks into a palm tree] No, that’s a tree. 
</p><p>Jack: Oh, shut it. [turns the key in the lock and the chest opens with a clang; he opens the lid and reveals a still beating heart, picks it up and stuffs it down his shirt when Elizabeth and co. run in, slamming the lid of the chest shut before he goes; Ragetti and Pintel resume carrying the now empty chest and they go on running to the beach] 
</p><p>Jack: [runs towards their abandoned boat] Jar of dirt! [finds it and after spilling some dirt out, stuffs the heart inside and covers it with some of the dirt he’s spilled out; just as he closes the lid one of Jones’s Crew comes at him; Jack fights with an oar; Elizabeth and co. make it out onto the beach as well, and Will and Norrington are still rolling around and around in their wheel, which is heading towards the beach; it rolls over a few of the pirates Elizabeth is fighting with and finally, with a groan, stops and falls over; Norrington and Will climb out with some difficulty, very dizzy after their ride; they can’t walk or stand straight and keep falling over] 
</p><p>Will: [sees the fight] Great. [tries to walk to it and falls over and can’t seem to get up; Norrington’s a bit more successful – he runs to the boat, grabs the Letters of Marque out of Jack’s Jacket pocket and notices some spilled dirt, being clever, he realizes what must’ve been done and all we see is his putting something away in his shirt] 
</p><p>[Ragetti and Pintel thinking themselves clever, place the chest into the boat and push off, Will stops them and levels his sword at them; they go for their own before realizing Elizabeth’s got them; they shrug and brandish a net and an oar against him; that’s when Will spots the chest and forgetting the two, picks it up instead; Jack notices his noticing and “accidentally” knocks Will out with his oar] 
</p><p>Elizabeth: Will. [runs over to Will lying half in half out of the boat] 
</p><p>Jack: Leave him lie! Unless you plan on using him to hit something with. [the undead Crew close in on them] 
</p><p>Elizabeth: We’re not coming out of this. 
</p><p>Norrington: Not with the chest. Into the boat. [he grabs the chest] 
</p><p>Elizabeth: You’re mad. 
</p><p>Norrington: Don’t wait for me. [runs off as a distraction with the chest clutched close; the Crew follows] 
</p><p>Jack: I-I say we respect his final wish. 
</p><p>Pintel: Aye! [they push off] 
</p><p>[Norrington runs for a while through the trees before he trips and falls, he reaches for his sword but the pirate who had previously lost his head and is not holding it in his hand steps on it] 
</p><p>Conch-head: Your bravery is wasted. I shall pry the chest away from your cold… dead… hands. 
</p><p>Norrington: Here you go. [throws it to the pirate who drops his head and catches the chest; he runs off; the Crew have a laugh at his expense] 
</p><p>Conch-head: [his body walks away with the chest, leaving the head] What… Anido, Anido! Pirates. [rolls into the conch and a crab emerges from the shell and crawls after the pirates] Come back here. Hey,—?? 
</p><p>SCENE 16: The Kraken attacks thrice 
</p><p>Will: [wakes up on board, Elizabeth staring down on him] What happened to the chest? 
</p><p>Elizabeth: Norrington took it to draw them off. 
</p><p>Pintel: [bickering over the sails] You’re pulling too hard! 
</p><p>Ragetti: You aren’t pulling hard enough. [hangs on the rope] 
</p><p>Gibbs: [to Jack] Where’s the Commodore? 
</p><p>Jack: [clutching his jar of dirt] Fell behind. 
</p><p>Gibbs: My prayers be with him. [shrugs] Best not wallow in our grief. The bright side is: you’re back. And made it off free and clear. [the Flying Dutchman pops out of the water next to the Pearl] 
</p><p>Elizabeth: [in fright] Ah, the F- [doesn’t finish her thought] 
</p><p>Gibbs: Lord, I done that. [crosses himself] 
</p><p>Jack: [pushes Gibbs out of the way] I’ll handle this, mate. Oi, fish face! [holds up his jar of dirt] Lose something, aye?—?? [loses footing and falls a short way down the stairs with his dirt; the whole Crew ‘ooh’s’ and cringes in sympathy at his fall; holds up the jar again] Got it! Come to negotiate, eh, have you, you slimy git. Look what I got. [in a sing song voice] I’ve got a jar of di-irt, I’ve got a jar of di-irt, and guess what’s inside it? 
</p><p>Davy Jones: Enough. [the cannons are slid out and Jack loses his smile] 
</p><p>Jack: Hard to starboard. 
</p><p>Elizabeth: Hard to starboard! [Gibbs turns the wheel frantically to turn the Pearl] 
</p><p>Will: Raise up the foreyard! 
</p><p>Davy Jones: Rack the starboard! Send his beloved Pearl back to the depths. [the cannons fire and some hit the Pearl as it retreats] 
</p><p>Ragetti: [spots the Flying Dutchman in pursuit through a cannonball made hole] She’s on us! She’s on us! 
</p><p>Davy Jones: Let them taste the triple guns. 
</p><p>Undead pirate: Aye, Captain. [triple cannons are rolled out in the front an they fire, further damaging the ship; Jack takes over the steering] 
</p><p>Will: [maneuvering the sails, hand the rope over to another] Make fast! 
</p><p>Pintel: [pets the ship’s railing] Don’t let me down. Show us what you’ve got. 
</p><p>Elizabeth: She’s falling behind! 
</p><p>Gibbs: Aye, we’ve got her. 
</p><p>Will: We’re the faster? 
</p><p>Gibbs: Against the wind the Dutchman beats us, that’s how she gets her prey. But with the wind… 
</p><p>Will: We’ve got her advantage. 
</p><p>Gibbs: Aye. 
</p><p>Blowfish headed pirate: We’re out of range! 
</p><p>Davy Jones: Break off pursuit, run on light and douse canvas! 
</p><p>Hammer-head shark Pirate: We’ve given up, sir? [smiles wickedly and they pirate smiles with him; the call for the Kraken is worked up once more] 
</p><p>Marty: They’ve given up. Yeaaaah! [the Crew cheers; Ragetti and Pintel do a jig] 
</p><p>Will: [to Jack] My father is on that ship. If we can outrun her, we can take her. We should turn and fight. 
</p><p>Jack: Why fight when you can negotiate? All one needs is the proper leverage. [place the jar of dirt on the banister and pets it; the ship shudders to a halt and the jar falls and breaks, scattering his dirt everywhere; he runs down to sift through the dirt, but the heart’s not there] Where is it? Where is the thump thump? 
</p><p>Sailor: We must’ve hit the reef. [points down where the water is bubbling under the hull] 
</p><p>Will: No. It’s not a reef! [grabs Elizabeth] Get away from the rail! 
</p><p>Elizabeth: What is it? 
</p><p>Will: The Kraken. To arms! 
</p><p>Gibbs: Load guns, defend the mast! 
</p><p>Will: It’ll attack the starboard, I’ve seen it before. Roll out the cannons and hold for my signal. [the cannons are loaded and run out; the tentacles of the Kraken begin creeping up the ship’s sides] 
</p><p>Will: Easy boys. 
</p><p>Elizabeth: Will? 
</p><p>Will: Steady! Steady. 
</p><p>Elizabeth: Will? 
</p><p>Will: Hold. Hold! 
</p><p>Pintel: I think we’ve held fire long enough! 
</p><p>Elizabeth: Will! 
</p><p>Will: Fire! [the cannons are fired and the Kraken retreats slightly wounded; the Crew cheers] It’ll be back. We have to get off the ship. 
</p><p>Elizabeth: There’s no boats. [the boats are all broken] 
</p><p>Will: [sees a barrel of powder roll across the deck] Pull the grates; get all the gunpowder onto the net in the cargo hold. [hands Elizabeth a rifle] Whatever you do, don’t miss. 
</p><p>Elizabeth: As soon as you’re clear. 
</p><p>Sailor: [the grates are pulled off and the net and powder readied] We are short-stocked on gunpowder. Six barrel! 
</p><p>Gibbs: [to Will] There’s only half a dozen kegs of powder. 
</p><p>Will: Then load the rum! [everyone get very quiet and stares at Will] 
</p><p>Gibbs: [after some hesitation, the Crew staring expectantly at him now] Aye, the rum, too! [his face contorts in mourning for the rum; the rum is loaded onto the net] 
</p><p>[Jack is rowing away from the Pearl] 
</p><p>Elizabeth: [to Cotton] Step to. [spots Jack in his row boat] You coward. [the ship shudders again] 
</p><p>Marty: Not good. 
</p><p>[the Kraken is much more vigorous this time and smashes its tentacles straight into the ship at both sides] 
</p><p>Will: [with the rum and powder] Haul away! 
</p><p>Gibbs: Heave! Heave like you’re being paid for it! [the Kraken is wreaking havoc, throwing Sailors around and breaking everything in the bottom holds; one is pulled through the porthole with a lot of cracking bones right between Ragetti and Pintel] 
</p><p>[Jack is still rowing away; stops, looks at his groaning ship, then looks to the island he was making for; pulls out his compass to check on his decision, we do not yet see where it pointed] 
</p><p>Gibbs: I gotcha! I gotcha! [holds the arms of a Sailor being pulled away by a tentacle] 
</p><p>Sailor: [gets pulled away] Save me! 
</p><p>[Elizabeth runs to get her rifle and Will founders in the net when the Kraken breaks the wheel that was being turned to lift the net] 
</p><p>Will: Hyah! Come on! [flings his sword around at the Kraken] Come and get me! I’m over here. Come on! [the Kraken upsets the net and Will’s leg gets caught in the netting, he takes out his father’s knife to free himself] 
</p><p>Will: [Elizabeth tries to aim but hesitates as Will is still on the net] Shoot! Elizabeth, shoot! [she still hesitates and her footing is taken out from under her as a tentacle starts dragging her away; Ragetti severs it; she runs back to get the gun, but a foot steps on at she’s about to pick it up – Jack’s returned and he takes aim now as she clings to his legs; Will finally severs the rope holding his leg and falls free of the net; Jack shoots and is successful in blowing the kegs up as the Kraken is tugging at them; it retreats with a groan of pain, charred pieces of tentacles left on deck; the dazed survivors walk over to the railing] 
</p><p>Marty: Did we kill it? 
</p><p>Gibbs: No. We just made it angry. We’re not out of this yet. Captain, orders! 
</p><p>Jack: Abandon ship. Into the long boat. 
</p><p>Gibbs: Jack, the Pearl. 
</p><p>Jack: She’s only a ship, mate. 
</p><p>Elizabeth: He’s right, we have to head for land. 
</p><p>Pintel: It’s a lot of open water. 
</p><p>Ragetti: It’s a lot of water. 
</p><p>Will: We’ll have to try it. We can get away as it takes down the Pearl. 
</p><p>Gibbs: Abandon ship. Abandon ship or abandon hope. [they load the boat with some supplies while Jack says his silent goodbye to the Pearl; Elizabeth follows him] 
</p><p>Elizabeth: Thank you, Jack. 
</p><p>Jack: We’re not free yet, though. 
</p><p>Elizabeth: You came back. I always knew you were a good man. [kisses him and Will chances to see it through a gap in the railing for a moment before Gibbs blocks his view] 
</p><p>Gibbs: Prepare to cast off! No time to lose! C’mon, Will, step to it. [a shell shocked Will climbs down into the boat] 
</p><p>Elizabeth: [backs him up against a mast and chains him to it] It’s after you, not the ship. It’s not us. It’s the only way, don’t you see. [leans in as if she’s going to kiss him again, but refrains] I’m not sorry. 
</p><p>Jack: Pirate. [Elizabeth leaves Jack standing there, chained to the mast] 
</p><p>Will: Where’s Jack? 
</p><p>Elizabeth: He elected to stay behind to give us a chance. [everyone looks up and hesitate to cast off] Go! [they sail off, Elizabeth looking decidedly not well] 
</p><p>Jack: [frantically tries to break the chains] Bugger, bugger, bugger, bugger, bugger. [there is a groaning underfoot, the Kraken is coming; Jack gets innovative and reaches for a lantern with his sword, breaks it and pours the oil over his chained wrist enabling him to slip it out of the shackle] C’mon. C’mon, that’s it. Ah. [he slips free just as the tentacles of the Kraken rise over the ship, it’s mouth opening wide in a roar, splattering Jack with its saliva and also spitting out his lost hat] Not so bad. [wipes the saliva off his face] Oh. [bends down to pick up his hat, puts it on] Hello, beastie. [takes out his sword and charges at it heroically as it swallows him up and then takes down the Pearl in a tight embrace; the Crew on the long boat watch quietly and Davy Jones watches through his telescope] 
</p><p>Davy Jones: Jack Sparrow, our debt is settled. 
</p><p>Undead pirate: Captain goes down with his ship. 
</p><p>Hammer-head shark Pirate: Turns out not even Jack Sparrow can best the devil. 
</p><p>Davy Jones: Open the chest. Open the chest, I need to see it! [the chest is opened and there is nothing inside] Damn you, Jack Sparrooooow! 
</p><p>Scene 17: Bargaining and to World’s End[/b] 
</p><p>[in Port Royal] Mercer: The last of our ships has returned. 
</p><p>Beckett: Is there any news on the chest? 
</p><p>Mercer: No. But, one of the ships did pick up a man, adrift at sea. He had these. [holds up the Letters of Marque and lays them down on the table; Beckett unfolds them] 
</p><p>Norrington: I took the liberty of filling in my name. 
</p><p>Beckett: [beckons to Norrington] If you intend to claim these, then you must have something to trade. D’you have the compass? 
</p><p>Norrington: [shakes his head] Better. [thumps down a bag on the table, what’s inside is thumping, too] The heart of Davy Jones. 
</p><p>[in Tia Dalma’s swamp, the long boat makes it’s way to her hut and there are many people standing along their way, all holding candles and humming softly; once inside, Will keeps stabbing his knife into the grain of the wood and taking it out, pieces of the table coming out with it] 
</p><p>Tia Dalma: [brings out a tray of drinks; offers to Elizabeth first] Against the cold. And a sorrow. [Elizabeth takes a cup, looking haunted; Will in next] It’s a shame. I know you’re thinking that with the Pearl, you could’ve—?? and free your father’s soul. 
</p><p>Will: Doesnâ€™t matter now. The Pearl’s gone… along with its Captain. [thuds his knife down into the table again] 
</p><p>Gibbs: Aye. And already the world seems a bit less bright. He fooled us all, right to the end. But I guess that honest streak finally won out. [toasts] To Jack Sparrow! 
</p><p>Ragetti: Never another like Captain Jack. [raises his cup] 
</p><p>Pintel: He was a gentleman of fortune, he was. [raises his cup] 
</p><p>Elizabeth: He was a good man. [drinks; Will says nothing just stares at Elizabeth] 
</p><p>Will: If there was anything to be done to bring him back, Elizabeth… 
</p><p>Tia Dalma: [to Will] Would you do it? Hmm? [to Elizabeth] What would you? Hmm? What would any of you be Willing to do? Hmm? Will you sail to the ends of the earth and beyond to fetch back—(??) Jack and his precious Pearl? 
</p><p>Gibbs: Aye. 
</p><p>Pintel: Aye. 
</p><p>Ragetti: Aye. 
</p><p>Cotton’s parrot: Awk! Aye. 
</p><p>Elizabeth: [nods] Yes. 
</p><p>Will: [nods as well; softly] Aye. 
</p><p>Tia Dalma: All right, but if you’re going to brave the weird and haunted shores at world’s end… then, you Will need a Captain who knows those waters. 
</p><p>Barbossa: [steps down the stairs] So, tell me, what’s become of my ship? [the monkey jumps on his shoulder and he finally takes a bite of his apple, looking well pleased] 
</p><p>THE END
</p>















<p>SCENE 1: Hangings in Port Royal 
</p><p>[camera opens on a noose, East India Company flag, then shows people walking up to a row of gallows, seven at a time] 
</p><p>Officer: In order to effect a timely halt to deteriorating conditions, and to ensure the common good, a state of emergency is declared for these territories, by decree of Lord Cutler Beckett, duly appointed representative of His Majesty the King. By decree, according to martial law, the following statutes are temporarily amended: right to assembly, suspended. [shot of feet coming through gallows floor] Right to habeus corpus, suspended. [shot of feet coming through gallows floor] Right to legal counsel, suspended. [shot of feet coming through gallows floor] Right to verdict by a jury of peers, suspended. [shot of feet coming through gallows floor] All persons convicted of piracy, or aiding a person convicted of piracy, or associating with a person convicted of piracy, shall be sentenced to hang by the neck until dead. 
</p><p>Child [singing]: The king and his men, stole the queen from her bed, and bound her in her bones. The seas be ours, and by the powers, where we will, we’ll roam. [executioner places child on top of barrel so he reaches the noose] 
</p><p>Man [singing]: Yo, ho, all hands, hoist the colors high. 
</p><p>All [singing]: Heave ho, thieves and beggars, never shall we die. 
</p><p>Officer: Lord Beckett. They’ve started to sing, sir. 
</p><p>Beckett: Finally. 
</p><p>All [singing]: Yo ho, all together, hoist the colors high. Heave ho, thieves and beggars, never shall we die. 
</p><p>[coin drops] 
</p><p>SCENE 2: Welcome to Singapore 
</p><p>[camera opens on Elizabeth in a small boat paddling through the water below the walkways of Singapore] 
</p><p>Elizabeth [singing]: ...the bell has been raised from its watery grave; hear its sepulchral tone? A call to all, pay heed the squall, and turn your sails toward home!... yo ho, all together, hoist the colors high. Yo ho, 
thieves... 
</p><p>Tai Huang: ...and beggars, never say we die. A dangerous song to be singing, for anyone ignorant of its meaning. Particularly a woman, particularly a woman alone. 
</p><p>Barbossa: What makes you think she’s alone? 
</p><p>Tai Huang: You protect her? 
</p><p>Elizabeth [puts knife to Tai Huang’s neck]: And what makes you think I need protecting? 
</p><p>Barbossa: Your master’s expectin’ us. An unexpected death would cast a slight pall on our meeting. 
</p><p>[Elizabeth releases Tai Huang from her grip. British soldiers pass by on the path above and the group exits into a passageway below] 
</p><p>[Cuts to what looks like turtles going through the water below the pathway somewhere else in the town. Shells, now seen to be coconuts, lift out of water to reveal Pintel, Ragetti, Gibbs, Marty and Cotton underneath, breathing through bamboo straws] 
</p><p>[Cuts to shot of cartwheels on the pathway above] 
</p><p>[Cuts back down to them approaching a sewer grating] 
</p><p>Cotton’s parrot: Steady as she goes! 
</p><p>[Cuts back to Tia wheeling a cart onto the bridge above them as Jack the monkey turns a crank to play music] 
</p><p>[Cuts back to them as they start to saw through the grating] 
</p><p>Gibbs: All right. 
</p><p>[Cuts back to Elizabeth and Barbossa following Tai Huang and his men] 
</p><p>Elizabeth: Have you heard anything from Will? 
</p><p>Barbossa: I trust young Turner to acquire the charts, and you to remember your place in the presence of Capt. Sao Feng. 
</p><p>Elizabeth: Is he that terrifying? 
</p><p>Barbossa: He’s much like myself, but absent my merciful nature and sense of fair play. 
</p><p>[Cuts back to Gibbs &amp; company at grating] 
</p><p>Gibbs: We’re through! Make ready. 
</p><p>[They arrive at the entrance to Sao Feng’s hideout and someone on the other side opens a slit in the door] 
</p><p>Tai Huang: Hoi. [Door opens and they enter] 
</p><p>[Cuts to Sao Feng’s hideout. Barbossa and Elizabeth give up their weapons to the guards. Elizabeth makes to move past Tai Huang, he holds up his hand to stop her] 
</p><p>Tai Huang: You think because she is a woman we would not suspect her of treachery? 
</p><p>Barbossa: Well, when you put it that way. 
</p><p>Tai Huang: Remove, please. 
</p><p>[Elizabeth removes her hat and outer coat to reveal a leather harness with several more guns and bombs on it, then pulls another large cannon out of her boot] 
</p><p>Tai Huang: Remove, please. [smiles slyly] 
</p><p>[Elizabeth also removes pants] 
</p><p>[Several shots as they make their way through the area to where Sao Feng is. Sao Feng turns around and Barbossa and Elizabeth bow] 
</p><p>Sao Feng: Captain Barbossa. Welcome to Singapore. [to one of his servants] More steam. 
</p><p>[She pulls a rope and it cuts to a shot of a man below pulling another rope to release more steam, then shows big fat guy and Gibbs &amp; company. Ragetti sees fat man and attempts to leave, Gibbs grabs him] 
</p><p>Gibbs: None of that. If things don’t go the way we want them we’re the only chance they’ve got. 
</p><p>[then back to Sao Feng, Elizabeth and Barbossa] 
</p><p>Sao Feng: I understand you have a request to make of me. 
</p><p>Barbossa: More of a proposal to put to ye. I have a venture underway and happen to find myself in need of ship and a crew. 
</p><p>Sao Feng: This is an odd coincidence. 
</p><p>Elizabeth: Because you happen to have a ship a and crew you don’t need? 
</p><p>Sao Feng: No. Because, earlier this day, not far from here, a thief broke into my most revered uncle’s temple and tried to make off with these. [holds up the charts] The navigational charts. The route to the farthest gate. Wouldn’t it be amazing if this venture of yours took you to the world beyond this one? 
</p><p>Barbossa: It would strain credulity at that. 
</p><p>[Sao Feng motions to his men and they pull Will up out of a tub of hot water] 
</p><p>Sao Feng: [points to Will] This is the thief. Is his face familiar to you? 
[Elizabeth and Barbossa both shake their heads] 
</p><p>Sao Feng: Then I guess he has no further need for it. [makes to kill Will; Elizabeth gasps] 
</p><p>Sao Feng: So, you come into my city, and betray my hospitality. 
</p><p>Barbossa: Sao Feng, I assure you, I had no idea... 
</p><p>Sao Feng: That he would get caught?!? You intend to attempt a voyage to Davy Jones’ locker. When I cannot help but wonder, why? 
</p><p>[Barbossa tosses a piece of eight to Sao Feng who catches it] 
</p><p>Barbossa: The song has been sung. The time is upon us. We must convene the Brethren Court. As one of the nine pirate lords you must honor the call. 
</p><p>Sao Feng: More steam. 
</p><p>[lady pulls lever and steam doesn’t come immediately. cuts down to our guys below, then back up] 
</p><p>Sao Feng: More steam! 
</p><p>[cuts down below to Marty hitting the huge guy in the face with a shovel. pans over to Cotton pulling string to release more steam] 
</p><p>[cuts back to upper level] 
</p><p>Sao Feng: There’s a price on all our heads, it is true. Since it seems that the only way a pirate can turn a profit anymore is by betraying other pirates... 
</p><p>[cuts to Ragetti looking up through the floorboards underneath Elizabeth] 
</p><p>Ragetti: It’s Elizabeth. 
</p><p>[pans over to the others unrolling the bundle of weapons and taking the weapons] 
</p><p>Gibbs: Wait for the signal. 
</p><p>Barbossa [above]: ...the first Brethren Court gave us rule of the seas. That rule has been challenged by Lord Cutler Beckett. 
</p><p>[cuts back to upper level] 
</p><p>Sao Feng: Against the East India Trading Company, what value is the Brethren Court? What can any of us do? 
</p><p>Elizabeth: You can fight! [steps forward and one man grabs her shoulder and she shakes free of him] Get off me! You are Sao Feng, the pirate lord of Singapore! 
</p><p>[cuts to down blow and Pintel looks up through the floorboards just as the man that grabbed Elizabeth takes her spot that he looks up to. Pintel makes a disgusted face] 
</p><p>[cuts back to upper level] 
</p><p>Elizabeth: ...would you have that era come to an end on your watch? The most notorious pirates from around the world are uniting against our enemy, and yet you sit here, cowering in your bath water! 
</p><p>Sao Feng: Elizabeth Swann, there’s more to you than meets the eye, isn’t there? And the eye does not go wanting. But I cannot help but notice. You have failed to answer my question. What is it you seek in Davy Jones’ locker? 
</p><p>Will: Jack Sparrow. [girls giggle] He’s one of the pirate lords. 
</p><p>Sao Feng: The only reason I would want Jack Sparrow returned from the land of the dead... is so I can send him back myself! 
</p><p>Barbossa: Jack Sparrow holds one of the nine pieces of eight. He failed to pass it along to a successor before he died. So we must go and get him back. 
</p><p>[Sao Feng notices the tattoo on one of the men in front of him begin to drip off] 
</p><p>Sao Feng: So, you admit, you have deceived me. Weapons! 
</p><p>[all Sao Feng’s men draw their weapons] 
</p><p>[cuts to shot down below] 
</p><p>Gibbs: Weapons! 
</p><p>[cuts back to shot of Elizabeth and Barbossa] 
</p><p>Barbossa: Sao Feng I assure you, our intentions are strictly honorable. 
</p><p>[just then swords pop up through the floorboards and Elizabeth and Barbossa catch them] 
</p><p>Sao Feng: [puts his sword to man’s neck] Drop your weapons or I kill the man! 
</p><p>Barbossa: Kill him, he’s not our man. 
</p><p>Will: If he’s not with you, and he’s not with us...who’s he with? 
</p><p>[East India Trading Co. soldiers bust into the room and fighting erupts] 
</p><p>Elizabeth [as Will is fighting and gets himself detached from the pole that was behind his back]: Will! 
</p><p>[Will catches sword][they continue fighting through the city] 
</p><p>Soldier: Ready, aim, fire! 
</p><p>[Tia uses her cart to blow them up] 
</p><p>[eventually cuts to shot of Sao Feng pinning Will up against a wall, shows Mercer watching them] 
</p><p>Sao Feng: It is an odd coincidence that the East India Trading Co. finds me the day you show up in Singapore. 
</p><p>Will: It is coincidence only. [puts a knife to Sao Feng’s throat] If you want to make a deal with Beckett you need what I offer. 
</p><p>Sao Feng: You cross Barbossa, you’re willing to cross Jack Sparrow. Why should I expect any better? 
</p><p>Will: I need the Black Pearl to free my father. [takes knife away] You’re helping me to get it. 
</p><p>[cuts to Jack the monkey getting a firework and placing it on the railing of the walkway on top of a box] 
</p><p>Cotton’s parrot: Uh oh! 
</p><p>[Jack places a candle on the fuse to light it] 
</p><p>Cotton’s parrot: Fire in the hole! 
</p><p>[firework launches into shack full of fireworks which explodes] 
</p><p>Barbossa: Thank you, Jack! 
</p><p>Cotton’s parrot: Thank you, Jack! 
</p><p>[cuts to Barbossa, Elizabeth and Will walking up to one another on the docks] 
</p><p>Barbossa: You got the charts? 
</p><p>Will: And better yet, a ship and a crew. 
</p><p>Elizabeth: Where’s Sao Feng? 
</p><p>Will: He’ll cover our escape and meet us at Shipwreck Cove. 
</p><p>Tai Huang: This way, be quick. 
</p><p>[cuts to shot of Elizabeth walking up behind Tia on the boat they just acquired] 
</p><p>Elizabeth: There’s no place left for Sao Feng to cower. Do you think he will honor the call? 
</p><p>Tia Dalma: I cannot say. There is an evil on these seas that even the most staunch and bloodthirsty pirates have come to fear. 
</p><p>SCENE 3: Mercer Reports In 
</p><p>[shows the Flying Dutchman emerging from the water and completely destroying several pirate ships, then cuts to a piece of eight falling on the desk and Beckett picks it up] 
</p><p>Beckett: A piece of eight, nine of them you say? 
</p><p>Mercer: Our new friend in Singapore was very specific, nine pieces of eight. 
</p><p>Beckett: What’s the significance of that, I wonder? 
</p><p>Mercer: Does it matter? There’s nothing can hold against the armada, not with the Flying Dutchman at the lead. 
</p><p>Beckett: Nothing we know of. Did your friend happen to mention where the Brethren Court are meeting? 
</p><p>Mercer: He was mum on that, sir. 
</p><p>Beckett: Well then, he knows the value of information. Best keep this between ourselves. Don’t want anyone running off to Singapore, now do we? [camera moves over to Gov. Swann signing papers] 
</p><p>[Norrington enters through the door] 
</p><p>Beckett: Ahh, Admiral. 
</p><p>Norrington: You summoned me, Lord Beckett. 
</p><p>Beckett: Yes. Something for you there. Your new station deserves an old friend. 
</p><p>[Norrington opens the case to find his sword he got when he was promoted to commodore] 
</p><p>[cuts back over to Gov. Swann] 
</p><p>Gov. Swann: Not more requisition orders? 
</p><p>Assistant: No sir, executions. 
</p><p>Beckett: The Brethren know they face extinction. All that remains is for them to decide where they make their final stand. 
</p><p>SCENE 4: Over the Edge... 
</p><p>[camera opens on Jack the monkey, Pintel, and Ragetti, all covered in ice, as is the boat] 
</p><p>Pintel: No one said anything about cold. 
</p><p>Ragetti: There must be a good reason for our suffering. 
</p><p>Pintel: Why don’t that obeah woman bring back Jack, the same way she brought back Barbossa? 
</p><p>Tia Dalma: Because Barbossa was only dead. Jack Sparrow is taken, body and soul, to a place not of death, but punishment. The worst fate a person can bring upon himself. Stretching on forever. That’s what awaits at Davy Jones’ locker. 
</p><p>Ragetti: I knew there was good reason. 
</p><p>[pans across the ship showing one of the crew accidentally breaking off his toe, then finally coming to Will and Tai Huang looking at the charts] 
</p><p>Will: Nothing here is set. These can’t be as accurate as modern charts. 
Tai Huang: No, but it leads to more places. 
</p><p>Will: [reading from the charts] Over the edge and over again. Sunrise sets flash of green... Do you care to interpret, Captain Barbossa? 
</p><p>Barbossa: Ever gazed upon the green flash, Master Gibbs? 
</p><p>Gibbs: I reckon I seen my fair share. It happens on rare occasion. At the last glimpse of sunset, a green flash of light shoots up into the sky. Some go their whole lives without seeing it, some claim to have seen it that ain’t. Some say... 
</p><p>Pintel: It signals when a soul comes back to this world, from the dead! [Gibbs gives him a death stare] Sorry. 
</p><p>Barbossa: Trust me, young Master Turner, it’s not gettin’ to the land of the dead that’s the problem. It’s gettin’ back. 
</p><p>[cuts to overhead shot of them going between two huge walls of ice, then shows the ship disappearing into the darkness between them] 
</p><p>SCENE 5: The Captain of the Flying Dutchman 
</p><p>Beckett: Bloody hell, there’s nothing left. 
</p><p>Mercer: Jones is a loose cannon, sir. 
</p><p>Beckett: Fetch the chest. 
</p><p>Mercer: And the Governor...he’s been asking questions about the heart. 
</p><p>Beckett: Does he know? 
</p><p>[they look at each other] 
</p><p>Beckett: Then perhaps his usefulness has run its course. 
</p><p>[shows soldiers and the Governor in boats rowing over to the Flying Dutchman] 
</p><p>[cuts to Davy mournfully playing his organ with only two of his tentacles. He picks up his locket which is playing the music and a single tear runs down his cheek. He picks it up with a tentacle, looks at it, and then becomes angry] 
</p><p>[cuts to soldiers rushing up onto the Flying Dutchman. Davy’s crew comes out to meet them, then Norrington emerges as well] 
</p><p>Norrington: [to Murtogg and Mullroy] Steady, men. 
</p><p>[Davy enters] 
</p><p>Davy Jones: Go! All of you! And take that infernal thing with you! I will not have it on my ship! 
</p><p>[Beckett and Mercer emerge] 
</p><p>Beckett: I’m sorry to hear that, because I will. Because it seems to be the only way to ensure that this ship do as directed by the company. We need prisoners to interrogate, which tends to work best when they’re alive. 
</p><p>Davy Jones: The Dutchman sails as its captain commands. 
</p><p>Beckett: And its captain is to sail it as commanded. I thought you would have learned that when I ordered you to kill your pet. This is no longer your world, Jones. The immaterial has become...immaterial. Admiral. 
</p><p>[Norrington and the men with the chest walk off towards Davy’s cabin. Cuts to shot of five men pointing their guns at Davy’s heart in the open chest] 
</p><p>Officer: Charge bayonets! 
</p><p>SCENE 6: At World’s End 
</p><p>[Shows the Hai Peng sailing through perfectly calm water with stars all around in the sky and water (looks like they are sailing in the night sky)] 
</p><p>Will [comes up behind Elizabeth who is looking out over the water]: How long do we continue not talking? 
</p><p>Elizabeth: Once we rescue Jack everything will be fine. 
</p><p>Will: When we rescue Jack? 
</p><p>[Elizabeth walks off; Tia walks up behind Will] 
</p><p>Tia Dalma: For what we want most, there is a cost must be paid in the end. 
</p><p>Will: Barbossa! Ahead! 
</p><p>Barbossa: Aye, we’re good and lost now. 
</p><p>Elizabeth: Lost? 
</p><p>Barbossa: For certain you have to be lost to find the places can’t be found. Elseways, everyone would know where it was. 
</p><p>Gibbs: We’re gaining speed! 
</p><p>Barbossa: Aye. 
</p><p>Will: To stations! All hands, to stations! Hard to port, gather way! 
</p><p>Barbossa: Nay! Belay that! Let her run straight and true! 
</p><p>Pintel: Blimey! 
</p><p>[cuts to shot of HUGE falls at the end of the world then back to on boat] 
</p><p>Elizabeth: You’ve doomed us all! 
</p><p>Barbossa: Don’t be so unkind. You may not survive to pass this way again and these be the last friendly words you’ll hear. 
</p><p>Will: Tie her off! 
</p><p>Tia Dalma [mumbles]: Malfaiteur en Tombeau, Crocher l’Esplanade, Dans l’Fond d’l’eau! (French meaning something like: fish the criminal out of his tomb, the walkway melts in the water) [throws crab claws] 
</p><p>Elizabeth: Hard to port! 
</p><p>Will: Hold on! 
</p><p>Barbossa: Ha ha ha ha! 
</p><p>[shows the ship turning and going off the waterfall backwards] 
</p><p>SCENE 8: Jack’s Entrance/Davy Jones’ Locker 
</p><p>Voices [on black screen, in background]: Strike your colors, you bloomin’ cockroaches...dead men tell no tales. 
</p><p>[all of a sudden opens on completely white screen. Jack’s nose appears onscreen and stiff’s its way along the table and looks at a peanut, then shows Jack replica putting on a napkin and preparing to eat the peanut with a fork. The real Jack shoots him and takes the peanut] 
</p><p>Jack: My peanut. All hands slackened braces! 
</p><p>Jack replica: Aye captain. Slackened braces! 
</p><p>Jack replica: Step lively! With a will! 
</p><p>Jack replica: Help. 
</p><p>Jack replica: Man the yards, you filthy toads! 
</p><p>[Jack replica lays an egg, then clucks like chicken] 
</p><p>Jack replicas x6 [on top of the mast]: Ho! Ho! 
</p><p>Jack replica: Haul the sheets, sensibly boys! 
</p><p>Jack replica: Aye captain. 
</p><p>Jack: Mr. Sparrow. 
</p><p>Jack replica: Aye captain. 
</p><p>Jack: What say you about the condition of this tack line? 
</p><p>Jack replica: It be proper to my eye, sir. 
</p><p>Jack: Proper? It is neither proper nor suitable, sir, it is neither acceptable nor adequate. It is in obvious fact an abomination. 
</p><p>Jack replica: Beggin’ your pardon, sir, but perhaps if you gave the men another chance. 
</p><p>Jack: Shall I? [stabs replica] That sort of thinking got us into this mess. Gentlemen, we have lost speed and therefore time, precious time, which cannot be regained once lost. Do you understand? 
</p><p>Jack replicas: Aye aye captain! 
</p><p>Jack: It will all have to be redone, all of it! And let that serve as a lesson to the lot of you! [camera moves to reveal Jack talking to only himself] Doldrums sir, has the whole crew on edge. I have absolutely no sympathy for any of you fecculant maggots. And no patience to pretend otherwise. Gentlemen, I wash my hands of this weirdness! [Jack grabs rope and jumps off the ship] No wind, of course there’s no bloody wind. On my soul I do swear, not a gust, a whisper, a tiny miniature lick. Yes, I know, but why would he do that? Well, because he’s a lummox, isn’t he? And we’ll have a magnificent garden party and you’re not invited. [giggles] [picks up rock] A rock. [throws it] [he turns around to see the rock on the ground right behind him again] Shoo. [picks up rock, licks it, and throws it and it turns into crab after he turns away] Now we’re being followed by rocks, never had that before. Oh, a rope! [pulls it] 
</p><p>[cuts to shot of Jack trying to pull the Pearl across the salt flats, then he falls over backwards. Then cuts to a whole bunch of rocks turning into a lot of crabs, then back to Jack with a shadow of the Pearl going over him. He stands up and looks a it dumbfounded, then begins to run after it] 
</p><p>[cuts away to shot of crew washing up on the beach] 
</p><p>Gibbs: This truly is a Godforsaken place. 
</p><p>Elizabeth: I don’t see Jack, I don’t see anyone. 
</p><p>Barbossa: He’s here. Davy Jones never once gave up that what he took. 
</p><p>Will: It doesn’t matter, we’re trapped here by your doing, no different than Jack. 
</p><p>Tia Dalma [while petting crab]: Witty Jack is closer than you think. 
</p><p>[Shows Jack on top of the Black Pearl’s mast coming over the top of a sand dune and down into the water] 
</p><p>Tai Huang: Impossible. 
</p><p>Ragetti: Boat. 
</p><p>Gibbs: Slap me thrice and hand me to me momma, it’s Jack! 
</p><p>[shows Jack walking up into beach towards them] 
</p><p>Pintel: It’s the captain! 
</p><p>Gibbs: A sight for sore eyes! Jack! 
</p><p>Jack: Mr Gibbs! 
</p><p>Gibbs: Aye, captain. 
</p><p>Jack: I thought so. I expect you can account for your actions, then? 
</p><p>Gibbs: Sir? 
</p><p>Jack: There has been a perpetual and virulent lack of discipline aboard my vessel! Why is that, sir? 
</p><p>Gibbs: You’re in Davy Jones’ locker, Captain. 
</p><p>Jack: I know that. I know where I am, and don’t think I don’t. 
</p><p>Barbossa: Jack Sparrow. 
</p><p>Jack: Ah, Hector. It’s been too long, hasn’t it? 
</p><p>Barbossa: Aye, Isla de Muerta, remember? You shot me. 
</p><p>Jack: No I didn’t. Ah, Tia Dalma, out and about, eh? You lend an agreeable sense of the macabre to any delirium. 
</p><p>Will: He thinks we’re a hallucination. 
</p><p>Jack: William, tell me something. Have you come because you need my help to rescue a certain distressing damsel? Or rather a damsel in distress? Either one. 
</p><p>Will No. 
</p><p>Jack: Then you wouldn’t be here. So you can’t be here. Q.E.D. you’re not really here. 
</p><p>Elizabeth: Jack, this is real, we’re here. 
</p><p>[Jack looks at her as he remembers what she did to him and scuttles back over to Gibbs] 
</p><p>Jack: The locker, you say? 
</p><p>Gibbs: Aye. 
</p><p>Elizabeth: We’ve come to rescue you. 
</p><p>Jack: Have you, now? That’s very kind of you. But seeing as I possess a ship and you don’t, it seems as though you’re the ones in need of rescuing and I’m not sure as I’m in the mood. 
</p><p>Barbossa: I see my ship [points to the Pearl] right there. 
</p><p>Jack: Can’t spot it, must be a tiny little thing hiding somewhere behind the Pearl. 
</p><p>Will: Jack. Cutler Beckett has the heart of Davy Jones. He controls the Flying Dutchman. 
</p><p>Elizabeth: He’s taking over the seas. 
</p><p>Tia Dalma: The song has already been sung. The Brethren Court is called. 
</p><p>Jack: Leave you people alone for a minute and look what’s happened, everything’s gone to pot. 
</p><p>Gibbs: Aye, Jack. The world needs you back something fierce. 
</p><p>Will: And you need a crew. 
</p><p>Jack: Why should I sail with any of you? Four of you have tried to kill me in the past, one of you succeeded. 
</p><p>[Will looks surprisedly at Elizabeth] 
</p><p>Jack: Oh, she’s not told you? You’ll have loads to talk about while you’re here. [turns to Tia] As for you... 
</p><p>Tia Dalma: Now, don’t tell me you didn’t enjoy it, at the time. 
</p><p>Jack: All right, fair enough, you’re in. [to Ragetti] Don’t need you, you scare me. Gibbs, you can come. Marty. Cotton. Cotton’s parrot, I’m a little iffy, but at least I’ll have someone to talk to. [to Tai Huang] Who are you? 
</p><p>Tai Huang: Tai Huang. These are my men. 
</p><p>Jack: Where do your allegiances lie? 
</p><p>Tai Huang: With the highest bidder. 
</p><p>Jack: I have a ship. 
</p><p>Tai Huang: That makes you the highest bidder. 
</p><p>Jack: Good man. Weigh anchor, all hands, prepare to make sail. 
</p><p>[Jack looks at compass which is spinning wildly] 
</p><p>Barbossa [tapping charts]: Jack, which way ya goin’, Jack? 
</p><p>SCENE 9: The Voyage Back 
</p><p>Barbossa: Trim that sail! 
</p><p>Jack: Trim that sail! 
</p><p>Barbossa: Slack windward brace and sheets! 
</p><p>Jack: Slack windward brace and sheets! 
</p><p>Barbossa: Haul that pallet line! 
</p><p>Jack: Haul that pallet line! 
</p><p>Barbossa: What ARE you doing? 
</p><p>Jack: What are YOU doing? 
</p><p>Barbossa: No, what ARE you doing? 
</p><p>Jack: What are YOU doing? 
</p><p>Barbossa: No, what ARE you doing? 
</p><p>Jack: What are YOU doing? Captain gives orders on the ship! 
</p><p>Barbossa: The captain of this ship is giving orders! 
</p><p>Jack: My ship, makes me captain. 
</p><p>Barbossa: They be my charts. 
</p><p>Jack: That makes you...chart man! 
</p><p>Pintel: Stow it! The both of you! That’s an order! Understand?!? Sorry. I just thought with the captain issue being in doubt, I’d throw my name in for consideration, sorry. 
</p><p>[Jack and Barbossa shuffle off up the stairs] 
</p><p>Ragetti: I’d vote for ya. 
</p><p>Pintel: Yeah? 
</p><p>[Barbossa pulls out his large spyglass and is looking out towards the front of the boat and Jack pulls his out too but it is too small so he gives up. cuts down below to Will and Elizabeth] 
</p><p>Will: You left Jack to the Kraken? 
</p><p>Elizabeth: He’s rescued now, it’s done with. Will, I had no choice. 
</p><p>Will: You chose not to tell me. 
</p><p>Elizabeth: I couldn’t. It wasn’t your burden to bear. 
</p><p>Will: But I did bear it, didn’t I? I just didn’t know what it was. I thought... 
</p><p>Elizabeth: You thought I loved him. 
</p><p>[she tries to leave and Will grabs her] 
</p><p>Will: If you make your choices alone, how can I trust you? 
</p><p>Elizabeth: You can’t. 
</p><p>[cuts to Pintel and Ragetti sitting, fishing on the front of the boat. Ragetti sees something in the water and yells and drops the fishing pole. They look over the side and see bodies floating within the water below] 
</p><p>Pintel: Eerie, that’s down right macabre. 
</p><p>Ragetti: Wonder what would happen if you dropped a cannon ball on one of ‘em. 
</p><p>[cuts to them carrying cannon balls and laughing, Tia gives them a look and they drop the cannon balls] 
</p><p>Pintel: Be disrespectful, it would. 
</p><p>Tia Dalma: They should be in the care of Davy Jones. That was the duty him was charged with by the goddess, Calypso. To ferry them who dies at sea to the other side. And every ten years he could come ashore to be with she who love him, truly. But the man has become a monster. 
</p><p>Ragetti: So he wasn’t always...tentacly? 
</p><p>Tia Dalma: No, him was a man...once. 
</p><p>Ragetti: Now it’s boats coming. 
</p><p>[others come to look at the boats coming, Gibbs begins loading a gun and Will stops him] 
</p><p>Will: They’re not a threat to us, am I right? 
</p><p>Tia Dalma: We are nothing but ghosts to them. 
</p><p>Barbossa: Is best just let them be. 
</p><p>Elizabeth: It’s my father, we’ve made it back. Father here, look here! 
</p><p>Jack: Elizabeth, we’re not back. 
</p><p>Elizabeth: Father! 
</p><p>Gov. Swann: Elizabeth, are you dead? 
</p><p>Elizabeth: No, no. 
</p><p>Gov. Swann: I think I am. 
</p><p>Elizabeth: No, you can’t be! 
</p><p>Gov. Swann: There was this chest, you see. And a heart. At the time it seemed so important. 
</p><p>Elizabeth: Come aboard! 
</p><p>Gov. Swann: I learned that if you stab the heart, yours must take its place. Sail the seas for eternity. The Dutchman must always have a captain. Silly thing to die for. 
</p><p>Elizabeth: Someone cast a line! 
</p><p>[Marty gives Elizabeth a line] 
</p><p>Tia Dalma [to Will]: A touch of destiny. 
</p><p>Elizabeth: Take the line! 
</p><p>Gov. Swann: Elizabeth, I’m so proud of you. 
</p><p>Elizabeth: Father, the line, take the line! [runs screaming toward stern of ship] 
</p><p>Tia Dalma: She must not leave the ship! [Will grabs Elizabeth] 
</p><p>Elizabeth: Father, come back with us! I won’t leave you! 
</p><p>Will [as he grabs her]: Elizabeth. 
</p><p>Gov. Swann: I’ll give your love to your mother, shall I? 
</p><p>Will [holding Elizabeth]: Is there a way? 
</p><p>Tia Dalma [shaking her head]: Him at peace. 
</p><p>[cuts to crew on deck under blazing sun] 
</p><p>Pintel: Why is all but the rum gone? 
</p><p>Gibbs: Rum’s gone too. 
</p><p>Tia Dalma: If we cannot escape these doldrums by nightfall, I fear we will sail trackless seas, doomed to roam the reach between worlds... forever. 
</p><p>Gibbs: With no water, forever seems to be arriving a mite too soon. 
</p><p>Will: [looks at Barbossa] Why doesn’t he do something? 
</p><p>Ragetti [to monkey]: Me eye! Give it back! 
</p><p>Gibbs: There’s no sense to it. 
</p><p>Will: And the green flash happens at sunset, not sunrise. 
</p><p>Gibbs: OVER THE EDGE... it’s drivin’ me over the bloomin’ edge. Sunrises don’t set. 
</p><p>[cuts to Jack] 
</p><p>Jack: UP IS DOWN. Well that’s just maddeningly unhelpful. Why are these things never clear? 
</p><p>[small Jacks emerge from Jack’s beard] 
</p><p>Small Jack: Clear as mud, Jackie. Stab the heart. 
</p><p>Small Jack: Don’t stab the heart. 
</p><p>Jack: Come again? 
</p><p>Small Jack: The Dutchman must have a captain. 
</p><p>Jack: Well that’s more than less than unhelpful. 
</p><p>Small Jack: Sail the seas forever. 
</p><p>Jack: I love the sea. 
</p><p>Small Jack: What about port? 
</p><p>Jack: I prefer rum. Rum’s good. 
</p><p>Small Jack: Making port. 
</p><p>Small Jack: Where we can get rum, and salty wenches, once every ten years. 
</p><p>Small Jack: What did he say? 
</p><p>Jack: Once every ten years. 
</p><p>Small Jack: Ten years years is a long time, mate. 
</p><p>Small Jack: But eternity is longer still. 
</p><p>Jack: Even longer given the deficit of rum. 
</p><p>Small Jack: And how will you be spending it? Dead? Or not? 
</p><p>Small Jack: The immortal Captain Sparrow. 
</p><p>Jack: Oh, I like that. 
</p><p>Small Jack: Come sunset it won’t matter. 
</p><p>Jack: Not sunset, sundown... and rise. [turns picture of boat upside down on chart] UP! Oh, what’s that? [runs over to side of boat] What’s that? I don’t know, what IS that? What do you think? 
</p><p>Elizabeth: Where? 
</p><p>Jack: There! 
</p><p>Elizabeth: What is it? 
</p><p>[Jack runs back and forth from side to side of the Pearl with everyone following him. Ragetti’s eye rolls around on a table, Barbossa pops it in his mouth, then sticks it back in the socket.] 
</p><p>Pintel: He’s rockin’ the ship! 
</p><p>Gibbs: We’re rockin’ the ship! 
Barbossa [looks at upside down ship on chart]: Aye, he’s onto it. 
</p><p><br />
Pintel: He’s rockin’ the ship! 
</p><p>Ragetti: We’ll tie each other to the mast, upside down, so when the boat flips, we’ll be the right way up. 
</p><p>Barbossa: Time it with the swell. [goes below] Loose the cannons, you stinking bilge rats! Unstow the cargo, let it shift! 
[Slowly, the Pearl turns upside down in the water] 
</p><p>Jack: Now up is down. 
</p><p>[They all go under the water. As the sun sets, a green flash is seen and the boat pops back into our world.] 
</p><p>Pintel: This was your idea. 
</p><p>Gibbs: Blessed sweet westerlies, we’re back! 
</p><p>Elizabeth: It’s the sunrise. 
</p><p>[Jack, Will, Elizabeth, and Barbossa all pull guns on each other; Jack the monkey points a gun at Cotton’s parrot] 
</p><p>Cotton’s parrot: Parlay? 
</p><p>Pintel: We need our pistols, get untied, hurry. 
</p><p>[They all laugh and lower their guns, then point them up again.] 
</p><p>Barbossa: All right, then. The Brethren Court’s a-gatherin’ at Shipwreck Cove. And Jack, you and I are a-goin’, and there’ll be no arguin’ that point. 
</p><p>Jack: I is arguin’ the point. If there’s pirates a-gatherin’, I’m pointing my ship the other way. 
</p><p>Elizabeth: The pirates are gathering to fight Beckett, and you’re a pirate. 
</p><p>Will: Fight or not, you’re not running, Jack. 
</p><p>Barbossa: If we don’t stand together, they’ll hunt us down one by one, till there be none left, but you. 
</p><p>Jack: I quite like the sound of that. Captain Jack Sparrow, the last pirate. 
</p><p>Barbossa: Aye, and you’ll be fightin’ Jones alone. And how does that figure into your plan? 
</p><p>Jack: I’m still working on that. But I’ll not be going back to the locker, mate, count on that. 
</p><p>[fires his gun at Barbossa but it doesn’t go off. They all fire, but guns don’t work.] 
</p><p>Gibbs: Wet powder. 
</p><p>Pintel: Wait! We can still use them as clubs. [Ragetti hits him on the head with his pistol] Ow! 
</p><p>Ragetti: Sorry. Effective, though. 
</p><p>[Cuts to pirates gathered around Will, looking at chart] 
</p><p>Will: There’s a freshwater spring on this island. We can resupply there, and get back to shooting each other later. 
</p><p>Jack: You can lead the shore party, and I’ll stay with my ship. 
</p><p>Barbossa: I’ll not be leaving my ship in your command. 
</p><p>Will: Why don’t you both go ashore and leave the ship in my command... temporarily. 
</p><p>[Barbossa is seen looking at the island through his spyglass. Jack emerges with a spyglass so long he can’t even hold it straight.] 
</p><p>Cotton’s parrot: Mind the boat. [Party goes ashore, where they see a huge grey dead Kraken washed up on the beach.] 
</p><p>Pintel: Crimety! 
</p><p>Ragetti: Hods bodkins! [as Pintel is poking the Kraken with a stick] Careful, careful! 
</p><p>Pintel: You stupid fish! 
</p><p>Ragetti: Actually, it’s a cephalopod. 
</p><p>Pintel: Serves you right! [their conversation continues in background] A lot of people would pay a shilling to see this, and another shilling for a sketchbook... ”Pintel and Ragetti, Kraken slayers”! ...serve up a slice as a souvenir... 
</p><p>Barbossa: Still thinking of running, Jack? Think you can outrun the world? You know, the problem with being the last of anything, is by and by, there be none left at all. 
</p><p>Jack: Sometimes, things come back, mate. We’re living proof, you and me. 
</p><p>Barbossa: Aye, but that’s a gamble of long odds, ain’t it? There’s never a guarantee of coming back, but passing on, that’s dead certain. 
</p><p>Jack: Summoning the Brethren Court, then, is it? 
</p><p>Barbossa: It’s our only hope, lad. 
</p><p>Jack: That’s a sad commentary in and of itself. 
</p><p>Barbossa: The world used to be a bigger place. 
</p><p>Jack: The world’s still the same. There’s just less in it. 
</p><p>[cuts to them finding the spring with a dead body in it. Barbossa tastes the water and spits it out.] 
</p><p>Barbossa: Poisoned. Fouled by the body. 
</p><p>Pintel [turns body over]: Hey, I know him! He was in Singapore! 
</p><p>Cotton’s parrot: Singapore! 
</p><p>Marty: Captain! 
</p><p>Ragetti: Oy, we’ve got company! [Sao Feng’s boat is seen alongside the Pearl, and Tai Huang’s men turn their guns on Jack] 
</p><p>Jack: [points to Barbossa] He’s the captain. 
</p><p>[cut to deck of Pearl] 
</p><p>Barbossa: Sao Feng, you showing up here, ‘tis truly a remarkable coincidence. 
</p><p>Sao Feng: Jack Sparrow, you paid me great insult once. 
</p><p>Jack: That doesn’t sound like me. [Sao Feng punches Jack in the nose.] Shall we just call it square, then? 
</p><p>Will [to Tai Huang’s men]: Release her. She’s not part of the bargain. 
</p><p>Barbossa: And what bargain be that? 
</p><p>Sao Feng: You heard Captain Turner. Release her. 
</p><p>Jack: Captain Turner? 
</p><p>Gibbs: Aye, the profidious rotter led a mutiny against us. 
</p><p>Will: I need the Pearl to free my father. That’s the only reason I came on this voyage. 
</p><p>Elizabeth: Why didn’t you tell me you were planning this? 
</p><p>Will: It was my burden to bear. 
</p><p>Jack: He needs the Pearl! Captain Turner needs the Pearl! And you felt guilty. And you and your Brethren Court! Did no one come to save me just because they missed me? [Gibbs rolls his eyes, then Marty, Pintel, Ragetti, Cotton, and Jack the monkey slowly raise their hands.] I’m standing over there with them. 
</p><p>Sao Feng: I’m sorry, Jack, but there’s an old friend who wants to see you first. 
</p><p>Jack: I’m not certain I can survive any more visits from old friends. 
</p><p>Sao Feng: Here’s your chance to find out. 
</p><p>[cuts to Jack and Beckett in Beckett’s office] 
</p><p>Beckett: It’s curious. Your friends appear to be quite desperate, Jack. Perhaps they no longer believe that a gathering of squabbling pirates is enough to take down the Flying Dutchman. And so despair leads to betrayal. But you and I are no strangers to betrayal, are we, Jack? [Jack is snooping around in Beckett’s office.] It isn’t here, Jack. 
</p><p>Jack: What? What isn’t? 
</p><p>Beckett: The heart of Davy Jones. It’s safely aboard the Dutchman, and so unavailable for use as leverage to satisfy your debt to the good Captain. 
</p><p>Jack: By my reckoning, that account has been settled. 
</p><p>Beckett: By your death? And yet, here you are. 
</p><p>Jack: Close your eyes and pretend it’s all a bad dream. That’s how I get by. 
</p><p>Beckett: And if Davy Jones were to learn of your survival? 
</p><p>[cuts outside to Mercer and Sao Feng and Will.] 
</p><p>Sao Feng: My men are crew enough. 
</p><p>Mercer: Company ship, company crew. 
</p><p>Will: You agreed, the Black Pearl was to be mine. 
</p><p>Sao Feng: And so it was. [crewman punches Will in the stomach and drags him off] 
</p><p>[cuts back to Beckett’s office] 
</p><p>Beckett: Perhaps you would consider an alternate arrangement, one that requires absolutely nothing from you but information. 
</p><p>Jack: Regarding the Brethren Court, no doubt? In exchange for fair compensation, square my debt with Jones, guarantee my freedom? 
</p><p>Beckett: Of course. It’s just good business. 
</p><p>Jack: Were I in a divulgatory mood, what then might I divulge? 
</p><p>Beckett: Everything. Where are they meeting? Who are the pirate lords? What is the purpose of the nine pieces of eight? 
</p><p>[cut to deck of Black Pearl] 
</p><p>Sao Feng: Beckett agreed the Black Pearl was to be mine. 
</p><p>Mercer: Lord Beckett’s not going to give up the only ship that can outrun the Dutchman, now is he? [Mercer exits] 
</p><p>Barbossa: It’s a shame they’re not bound to honor the Code of the Brethren, ain’t it? Because honor’s a hard thing to come by nowadays. 
</p><p>Sao Feng: There’s no honor in remaining with the losing side. Leaving it for the winning side, that’s just good business. 
</p><p>Barbossa: The losing side, you say? 
</p><p>Sao Feng: They have the Dutchman, now the Pearl. And what do the Brethren have? 
</p><p>Barbossa: We have Calypso. 
</p><p>Sao Feng: Hmph, Calypso! An old legend. 
</p><p>Barbossa: No, the goddess herself, bound in human form. I intend to release her, but for that I need the Court, all the Court. [grabs Sao Feng’s necklace] 
</p><p>[cut back to Beckett’s office] 
</p><p>Jack: You can keep Barbossa, the belligerent homunculus and his friend with the wooden eye both, and Turner... especially Turner. The rest go with me aboard the Pearl, and I will lead you to Shipwreck Cove, where I will hand you the pirates and you will NOT hand me to Jones. Bloody fair deal, don’t you think? 
</p><p>Beckett: And what becomes of Miss Swann? 
</p><p>Jack: What interest is she to you? 
</p><p>[deck of Pearl] 
</p><p>Sao Feng: What are you proposing, Captain? 
</p><p>Barbossa: What be accepted, Captain? 
</p><p>Sao Feng: The girl. 
</p><p>Elizabeth: What? 
</p><p>[Beckett’s office] 
</p><p>Beckett: Jack! I’ve just recalled, I have this wonderful compass which points to whatever I want. So for what do I need you? 
</p><p>[deck of Pearl] 
</p><p>Will: Elizabeth is not part of any bargain! 
</p><p>Barbossa: Out of the question. 
</p><p>Sao Feng: It was not a question. 
</p><p>[Beckett’s office] 
</p><p>Jack: It points to what you want most, and that’s not the Brethren Court, is it? 
</p><p>Beckett: Then what is? 
</p><p>Jack: Me. Dead. 
</p><p>[Pearl] 
</p><p>Elizabeth: Done. 
</p><p>Will: What? Not done! 
</p><p>Elizabeth: You got us into this mess! If this is what frees us, then done! 
</p><p>[Beckett’s office] 
</p><p>Beckett: Although if I kill you, then I can use the compass to find... Shipwreck Cove, was it? Cut out the middleman, as it were. 
</p><p>[Pearl] 
</p><p>Will: Elizabeth! They’re pirates! 
</p><p>Elizabeth: I’ve had more than enough experience dealing with pirates! 
</p><p>[shoves Will] 
</p><p>Barbossa: So we have an accord? 
</p><p>[Beckett’s office] 
</p><p>Jack: With me killed, you’d arrive at Shipwreck Cove, find its stronghold nigh impregnable, able to withstand blockade for years, and then you’d wish, “Oh, if only there were someone I had not killed inside to assure that the pirates then come outside...” 
</p><p>Beckett: And you can accomplish all this, can you? 
</p><p>Jack: You may kill me, but you may never insult me. Who am I? [Beckett flounders] I’m Captain Jack Sparrow! [ship is blasted by a cannonball. Jack grabs Beckett’s hand and shakes it.] Done! 
</p><p>[Jack runs out on deck and loads a cannon with a rope tied around the cannonball.] 
</p><p>Beckett: You’re mad! 
</p><p>Jack: Thank goodness for that, because if I wasn’t, this would probably never work. [Fires cannon, which hits mast and vaults Jack up and onto the statues at the back of the Black Pearl.] 
</p><p>Jack: And that was without a single drop of rum. [looks at Will] Send this pestilent traitorous cowhearted yeasty codpiece to the brig. 
</p><p>[cut back to deck of Endeavour] 
</p><p>Officer: Which ship do we follow? 
</p><p>Beckett: Signal the Dutchman to track down Sao Feng. We follow the Pearl. How soon can we have the ship ready to pursue? [mast cracks and falls over] 
</p><p>Officer: Do you think he plans it all out, or just makes it up as he goes along?

SCENE 10: Sao Feng’s Successor 
</p><p>[camera opens on Sao Feng in his cabin, talking to two ladies in Chinese and Elizabeth is standing over by a pole dressed up] 
</p><p>Sao Feng: By this time tomorrow we will arrive at Shipwreck Cove, and you will be free. Calypso. 
</p><p>Elizabeth: Excuse me? 
</p><p>Sao Feng: Not the name you fancy, I imagine, out of the many that you have. But it is what we call you. 
</p><p>Elizabeth: We being who? 
</p><p>Sao Feng: You confirm it. 
</p><p>Elizabeth: Confirm what? You’ve told me nothing. 
</p><p>Sao Feng: The Brethren Court, not I, the first Brethren Court, whose position I would have opposed, bound you to human form, so the rule of the seas would belong to men and not... 
</p><p>Elizabeth: ...me. 
</p><p>Sao Feng: But one such as you should never be anything less that what you are. 
</p><p>Elizabeth: Pretty speech from a captor. But words whispered through prison bars lose their charm. 
</p><p>Sao Feng: Can I be blamed for my efforts? All men are drawn to the sea, perilous though it may be. 
</p><p>Elizabeth: And some men offer desire as justification for their crimes. 
</p><p>Sao Feng: I offer simply my desire. 
</p><p>Elizabeth: And in return? 
</p><p>Sao Feng: I would have your gifts, should you choose to give them. 
</p><p>Elizabeth: And if I should choose not? 
</p><p>Sao Feng: Then I will take your fury! 
</p><p>[grabs Elizabeth and kisses her, she shoves him away and a cannonball bursts through the side of the ship, sending splintered wood flying. A large piece of wood skewers Sao Feng] 
</p><p>Elizabeth: Sao Feng! 
</p><p>Sao Feng: Here... please. With all nine pieces of eight, you will be free. Take it! You are captain now. Go in my place to Shipwreck Cove. 
</p><p>Elizabeth: Me? 
</p><p>Tai Huang: Captain the ship is taken we cannot... 
</p><p>Sao Feng: Forgive me, Calypso. 
</p><p>[Sao Feng dies] 
</p><p>Tai Huang: What did he tell you? 
</p><p>Elizabeth: He made me captain. 
</p><p>[Tai Huang turns and runs out followed by Elizabeth. Outside they are grabbed by two guards] 
</p><p>Tai Huang: You are not my captain. 
</p><p>Norrington [from below them]: Elizabeth? 
</p><p>Elizabeth: James! 
</p><p>[she shakes free of guard and goes down to Norrington who hugs her] 
</p><p>Norrington: Thank God you’re alive! Your father will be overjoyed to know you’re safe. 
</p><p>Elizabeth: My father’s dead. 
</p><p>Norrington: No, that can’t be true, he returned to England. 
</p><p>Elizabeth: Did Lord Beckett tell you that? 
</p><p>Davy Jones: Who among you do you name as captain? 
</p><p>Tai Huang: Captain? Her! 
</p><p>[Tai Huang and rest of crew point to Elizabeth and Davy gets surprised look on his face] 
</p><p>Davy Jones: Captain? 
</p><p>Norrington: Tow the ship. Put the prisoners in the brig, and the captain shall have my quarters. 
</p><p>Elizabeth: Thank you, but I prefer to remain with my crew. 
</p><p>Norrington: Elizabeth, I swear I did not know. 
</p><p>Elizabeth: Know what? Which side you chose? [steps back to her men] Well now you do. 
</p><p>[cuts down to the brig of the Flying Dutchman] 
</p><p>Elizabeth: Bootstrap? 
</p><p>[Bo’sun laughs and walks away] 
</p><p>Elizabeth: Bootstrap? Bill Turner? 
</p><p>[Koleniko laughs and walks away] 
</p><p>Bootstrap: Bootstrap. You know my name? [emerges from wall] 
</p><p>Elizabeth: Yes, I know your son. Will Turner. 
</p><p>Bootstrap: William. [laughs] He made it, he’s alive! And now he sends you to tell me that he’s coming to get me. [laughs] Godspoons! He’s on his way. 
</p><p>Elizabeth: Yes, Will is alive. And he wants to help you. 
</p><p>Bootstrap: He can’t help me, he won’t come. 
</p><p>Elizabeth: But you’re his father. 
</p><p>Bootstrap: I know you, he spoke of you. He can’t come because of you. 
</p><p>Elizabeth: Me? 
</p><p>Bootstrap: You’re Elizabeth. 
</p><p>Elizabeth: Yes, I’m Elizabeth. 
</p><p>Bootstrap: If Jones be slain, he who slays him must take his place. Captain forever. The Dutchman must always have a captain. If he saves me, he loses you. 
</p><p>Elizabeth: I see. 
</p><p>Bootstrap: He won’t pick me. I wouldn’t pick me. Tell him not to come. Tell him to stay away. It’s too late. I’m already a part of the ship. 
</p><p>Elizabeth: Bootstrap. 
</p><p>Bootstrap: You know my name! 
</p><p>Elizabeth [looking confused]: Yes, I know your son. 
</p><p>Bootstrap: William! He’s coming, wait and see, he promised. 
</p><p>SCENE 11: The Bread Crumb Trail 
</p><p>[men seen hoisting barrel with dead body tied to it onto deck of the Endeavour. Beckett breaks open bottle to pull out a piece of parchment with an East India Trading Co. symbol on it] 
</p><p>Officer: Sir? 
</p><p>Beckett: A bread crumb trail, and we’re meant to follow. 
</p><p>Officer: A betrayer among them? Or a trap? 
</p><p>Beckett: A gambit by a skilled opponent. Adjust course, Leftenant. 
</p><p>Officer: Sir? 
</p><p>Beckett: We can only hope to reach our destination before they run out of bodies. 
</p><p>[cuts to Will tying a body to a barrel at the bow of the Black Pearl] 
</p><p>Jack: Bravo, you escaped the brig even quicker than I expected. William, do you notice something? Or rather do you notice something that is not there to be noted? 
</p><p>Will: You haven’t raised an alarm. 
</p><p>Jack: Odd, isn’t it? But not as odd as this. Come up with this all by your lonesome, did you? 
</p><p>Will: I said to myself, think like Jack. 
</p><p>Jack: And this is what you’ve arrived at? Lead Beckett to Shipwreck Cove so as to gain his trust, accomplish your own ends? It’s like you don’t know me at all, mate. And how does your dearly beloved feel about this? [Will hesitates] Ah, you’ve not seen fit to trust her with it. 
</p><p>Will: I’m losing her Jack. Every step I take for my father is a step away from Elizabeth. 
</p><p>Jack: Mate, if you choose to lock your heart away, you’ll lose it for certain. If I may lend a machete to your intellectual thicket—avoid the choice altogether. Change the facts. Let someone else dispatch Jones. 
</p><p>Will: Who? [hesitates] You? 
</p><p>Jack: Death has a curious way or reshuffling one’s priorities. I’ll slip aboard the Dutchman, find the heart, stab the beating thing. Your father goes free, and you’re free to be with your charming murderess. 
</p><p>Will: And you’re willing to carve out your heart and bind yourself to the Dutchman, forever. 
</p><p>Jack: No mate, I’m free forever. Free to sail the seas beyond the edges of the map, free from death itself. 
</p><p>Will: You’ve got to do the job though, Jack. You have to ferry souls to the next world. Or end up just like Jones. [strokes his chin] 
</p><p>Jack: I don’t have the face for tentacles. But immortal has to count for something, eh? Oh! 
</p><p>[gives Will the compass] 
</p><p>Will: What’s this for? 
</p><p>Jack: Think like me, it’ll come to you. [Exhales puff of strong rummy breath into Will’s face and Will falls overboard. Jack cuts barrel with body on it loose and pushes it overboard too.] My regards to Davy Jones! 
</p><p>Will: I hate him. 
</p><p>SCENE 12: The Escape 
</p><p>[cut to brig of Flying Dutchman, where Norrington is unlocking the door.] 
</p><p>Norrington [to Elizabeth]: Come with me. [she doesn’t move] Quickly! [she nods to crew and they exit] 
</p><p>Elizabeth: What are you doing? 
</p><p>Norrington: Choosing a side. [Elizabeth exits cell. Bootstrap sees empty cell and looks around.] Do not go to Shipwreck Cove. Beckett knows of the meeting of the Brethren. I fear there may be a traitor among them. 
</p><p>Elizabeth: It’s too late to earn my forgiveness. 
</p><p>Norrington: I had nothing to do with your father’s death. That doesn’t absolve me of my other sins. 
</p><p>Elizabeth: Come with us. James, come with me. 
</p><p>[enter Bootstrap] 
</p><p>Bootstrap: Who goes there? 
</p><p>Norrington [to Elizabeth]: Go. I will follow. 
</p><p>Elizabeth: You’re lying. 
</p><p>Norrington: Our destinies have been entwined, Elizabeth... but never joined. [kisses her] Go! Now! [to Bootstrap] Back to your station, sailor.
</p><p>Bootstrap: No one leaves the ship. 
</p><p>Norrington: Stand down. That’s an order! 
</p><p>Bootstrap: That’s an order. That’s an order. Part of the crew, part of the ship. Part of the crew, part of the ship. 
</p><p>Norrington: Steady, man! 
</p><p>Bootstrap: Part of the crew, part of the ship. All hands, prisoner escape! 
</p><p>Norrington: Belay that! 
</p><p>[Norrington shoots the line between the ships and as he is turning back around Bootstrap spears him, then cuts down to water where Elizabeth is] 
</p><p>Elizabeth: James! James! No! 
</p><p>[cuts back up to Dutchman] 
</p><p>Clanker: Admiral’s dead? 
</p><p>Maccus: To the captain’s cabin! 
</p><p>Davy Jones: James Norrington, do you fear death? 
</p><p>[Norrington stabs Davy] 
</p><p>Davy Jones: I take that as a no. [pulls sword out of self] Nice sword. [walks off] 
</p><p>[shows crew killing soldiers as Davy walks into his cabin] 
</p><p>Mercer: The Dutchman is under my command. 
</p><p>Davy Jones: For now. [walks off] 
</p><p>SCENE 13: Calypso Revealed 
</p><p>[opens on deck of Black Pearl] 
</p><p>Gibbs: Look alive, and keep a weather eye! Not for naught it’s called Shipwreck Island, where lies Shipwreck Cove and the town of Shipwreck. 
</p><p>Pintel: You heard him. Step lively! 
</p><p>Jack: For all that pirates are clever cobs, we are an unimaginative lot when it comes to naming things. 
</p><p>Gibbs: Aye. 
</p><p>Jack: I once sailed with a geezer lost both of his arms and part of his eye. 
</p><p>Gibbs: And what’d you call him? 
</p><p>Jack: Larry. 
</p><p>[cuts to Barbossa and Tia at front of boat] 
</p><p>Barbossa: I don’t reneg on a bargain once struck. But we agreed on ends only, the means are mine to decide. 
</p><p>Tia: Caution, Barbossa. Do not forget it was by my power you return from the dead, or what it means should you fail me. 
</p><p>Barbossa: Don’t forget why you had to bring me back, and why I could not leave Jack to his well deserved fate. It took nine pirate lords to bind you, Calypso. And it’ll take no less than nine to set ye free. Masters Pintel and Ragetti—take this fishwife to the brig. 
</p><p>Pintel: Right this way, Mrs. Fish. 
</p><p>[they are seen going down stairs from front of boat. Cuts to Will and 
Beckett having tea in Beckett’s office. Enter Davy] 
</p><p>Davy Jones: I cannot be summoned like some mongrel pup. 
</p><p>Beckett: Apparently you can. I believe you know each other. 
</p><p>Davy Jones: [laughs] Come to join my crew again, Master Turner? 
</p><p>Will: Not yours, his. Jack Sparrow sends his regards. 
</p><p>Davy Jones: Sparrow? 
</p><p>Will: You’ve not told him? We rescued Jack from the locker along with the Black Pearl. 
</p><p>Davy Jones: What else have you not told me?!? 
</p><p>Beckett: There is an issue far more troublesome. I believe you are familiar with a person called Calypso. 
</p><p>Davy Jones: Not a person. A heathen god. One who delights in cursing men with their wildest dreams and then revealing them to be hollow and naught but ash. The world is well rid of her. 
</p><p>Will: Not quite so well actually. The Brethren Court intends to release her. 
</p><p>Davy Jones: No! They cannot! The first court promised to imprison her forever. That was our agreement! 
</p><p>Beckett: Your agreement? 
</p><p>Davy Jones: I showed them how to bind her. She could not be trusted. She gave me no choice. We must act before they release her. 
</p><p>Will: You loved her. She’s the one, and then you betrayed her. 
</p><p>Davy Jones: She pretended to love me! She betrayed me! 
</p><p>Will: And after which betrayal did you cut out your heart, I wonder? 
</p><p>Davy Jones [hits Will’s tea cup out of his hand]: Do not test me. 
</p><p>Will: I hadn’t finished that. You will free my father. [to Beckett] And you will guarantee Elizabeth’s safety, along with my own. 
</p><p>Beckett: Your terms are steep Mr. Turner. We will expect fair value in return. 
</p><p>Davy Jones: There is only one price I will accept. Calypso, murdered. 
</p><p>Will: Calypso is aboard the Black Pearl. Jack has sailed the Black Pearl to Shipwreck Cove. 
</p><p>Beckett: And with you no longer aboard her, how do you propose to lead us there? 
</p><p>Will: [holds up Jack’s compass] What is it you want most? 
</p><p>SCENE 14: The Brethren Court 
</p><p>[opens panning over Shipwreck Cove in the air, then to deck of Black Pearl] 
</p><p>Pintel: Look at them all! 
</p><p>Barbossa: There’s not been a gatherin’ like this in our lifetime. 
</p><p>Jack: And I owe them all money. 
</p><p>[cuts to inside courtroom with Barbossa banging a cannonball on the table] 
</p><p>Barbossa: As he who issued summons, I convene this, the fourth Brethren Court. To confirm your lordship and right to be heard, present now your pieces of eight, my fellow cap’ns. 
</p><p>[Ragetti walks around with a bowl and each person puts a piece of junk in it] 
</p><p>Pintel: Those aren’t pieces of eight, they’re just pieces of junk. 
</p><p>Gibbs: Aye, the original plan was to use nine pieces of eight to bind Calypso, but when the first court met, the brethren were to a one, skint broke. 
</p><p>Pintel: So change the name. 
</p><p>Gibbs: To what? ‘Nine Pieces of Whatever We Happened to Have in Our Pockets at the Time’? Oh yes, that sounds very piratey. 
</p><p>Barbossa: Mr. Ragetti, if you will. 
</p><p>Ragetti: I kept it safe for you, just like you said when you gave it to me. 
</p><p>Barbossa: Aye, ya have, but now I need it back. 
</p><p>[whacks Ragetti on the back of the head and his wooden eye pops out and he puts it in the bowl] 
</p><p>Villanueva: Sparrow! 
</p><p>Jack [touches coin dangling from his bandanna]: Might I point out that we are still short one pirate lord, and I’m content as a cucumber to wait until Sao Feng joins us. 
</p><p>Elizabeth [enters]: Sao Feng is dead. He fell to the Flying Dutchman. 
</p><p>Jack: And made you captain? They’re just giving the bloody title away now. 
</p><p>Elizabeth: Listen. Our location has been betrayed. Jones is under the command of Lord Beckett, they’re on their way here. 
</p><p>Jocard: Who is this betrayer? 
</p><p>Barbossa: Not likely anyone among us. 
</p><p>Elizabeth: Where’s Will? 
</p><p>Jack: Not among us. 
</p><p>Barbossa: And it matters not how they found us. The question is, what will we do now that they have? 
</p><p>Elizabeth: We fight! 
</p><p>Mistress Cheng: Shipwreck Cove is a fortress, a well supplied fortress. There is no need to fight if they cannot get to us. 
</p><p>Barbossa: There is a third course. In another age, at this very spot, the first court captured the sea goddess, and bound her in her bones. That was a mistake. Oh, we tamed the seas for ourselves, aye, but opened the door to Beckett and his ilk. Better were the days when mastery of seas came not from bargains struck with eldritch creatures, but from the sweat 
of a man’s brow and the strength of his back alone. Y’all know this to be true. Gentlemen, ladies. We must free Calypso. 
</p><p>Ammand: Shoot him! 
</p><p>Jocard: Cut out his tongue! 
</p><p>Jack: Shoot him and cut out his tongue, then shoot his tongue. And trim that scraggly beard. 
</p><p>Tai Huang: Sao Feng would have agreed with Barbossa. 
</p><p>Jocard: Calypso was our enemy then, she will be our enemy now. 
</p><p>Chevalle: And it’s not likely her mood’s improved. 
</p><p>Villanueva: I would still agree with Sao Feng, we release Calypso! 
</p><p>Chevalle: You threaten me? 
</p><p>Villanueva: I silence you! 
</p><p>[all hell breaks loose] 
</p><p>Elizabeth: This is madness. 
</p><p>Jack: This is politics. 
</p><p>Elizabeth: Meanwhile our enemies are bearing down upon us. 
</p><p>Barbossa: If they not be here already. 
</p><p>[cuts to shot of Black Pearl in the harbor, then to Tia in the brig. She is listening to the tune her locket is playing, then closes it and the music starts again a couple seconds later and she turns to see Davy walking out of the shadows on the other side of the room] 
</p><p>Tia Dalma: My sweet, you come for me. 
</p><p>Davy Jones: You were expecting me. 
</p><p>Tia Dalma: It has been torture, trapped in this single form. Cut off from the sea, from all that I love, from you. 
</p><p>Davy Jones: Ten years I devoted to the duty you charged to me. Ten years I looked after those who died at sea. And finally, when we could be together again, you weren’t there. Why weren’t you there? 
</p><p>Tia Dalma: Is my nature. Would you love me if I was anything but what I am? 
</p><p>Davy Jones: I do not love you. 
</p><p>Tia Dalma: Many things you were, Davy Jones, but never cruel. You have corrupted your purpose, and so yourself. And hid away what should always have been mine. [Touches him, and his tentacles disappear and he turns into his former human self] 
</p><p>Davy Jones: Calypso. 
</p><p>Tia Dalma: I will be free, and when I am I will give you my heart and we will be together always. If only you had a heart to give. [Takes her hand away and Davy reverts to octopus form] Why did you come? 
</p><p>Davy Jones: And what fate have you planned for your captors? 
</p><p>TiaDalma: The Brethren Court? The last thing they will learn in this life, is how cruel I can be. And what of your fate, Davy Jones? 
</p><p>Davy: My heart will always belong to you. [exits via wall] 
</p><p>[cuts back to courtroom. Barbossa is standing on table and fires gun to silence them] 
</p><p>Barbossa: It was the first court what imprisoned Calypso, and we will be the ones to set her free, and in her gratitude she will see fit to grant us boons. 
</p><p>Jack: Whose boons? Your boons? Utterly deceptive twaddlespeak, says I. 
</p><p>Barbossa: If you have a better alternative, please, share. 
</p><p>Jack: Cuttlefish. Let us not, dear friends, forget our dear friends the cuttlefish. Flippant glorious little sausages. Pen ‘em up together and they’ll devour each other without a second thought. Human nature, isn’t it?...or....or fish nature. [hand on Mistress Cheng’s shoulders] So yes, we could hole up here well provisioned and well armed and half of us would be dead within the month, which seems grim to me any way you slice it. Or, as my learned colleague so naively suggests, we could release Calypso, and we can pray that she will be merciful. I rather doubt it. Can we in fact pretend that she is anything other than a woman scorned, like 
which fury hell hath no? We cannot. Res ipso loquitur tabula in naufragio (Latin meaning something like “the thing speaks by itself, a plank in a shipwreck” referring to the fact that when all else fails, the plank in a shipwreck can be the only thing that saves you, or as Jack says:...), we are left with but one option. I agree with, and I cannot believe the words are comin’ out of me mouth, Captain Swann. We must fight. 
</p><p>Barbossa: You’ve only ever run from a fight. 
</p><p>Jack: I have not! 
</p><p>Barbossa: You have too! 
</p><p>Jack: Have not! 
</p><p>Barbossa: You have too! 
</p><p>Jack: Have not! 
</p><p>Barbossa: You have too, and you know it! 
</p><p>Jack: Have not, slander and calumny! I have only ever embraced that oldest and noblest of pirate traditions. I submit here and now, that is what we all must do, we must fight... to run away. 
</p><p>Gibbs: Aye! 
</p><p>Barbossa: As per the code, an act of war, and this be exactly that, can only be declared by the pirate king. 
</p><p>Jack: You made that up. 
</p><p>Barbossa: Did I now? I call on Captain Teague, keeper of the code. 
SeSumbhajee’s assistant: SeSumbhajee proclaims this all to be folly! Hang the code! Who cares... [gets shot] 
</p><p>Capt. Teague: Code is the law. [walks up behind Jack] You’re in my way, boy. 
</p><p>[two old men carry up the code and set it on the table] 
</p><p>Pintel: The code. 
</p><p>Ragetti: As set forth by Morgan and Bartholomew. 
</p><p>[Capt. Teague whistles and the dog comes with the key] 
</p><p>Ragetti: How did...? 
</p><p>Capt. Teague: Sea turtles, mate. [looks at code] Barbossa is right. 
</p><p>Jack: Hang on a minute. [checks the code] It shall be the duty of the king to declare war, parlay with said adversaries... fancy that. 
</p><p>Chevalle: There’s not been a king since the first court, and that’s not likely to change. 
</p><p>Capt. Teague: Not likely. 
</p><p>Elizabeth: Why not? 
</p><p>Gibbs: Because the king is elected by popular vote. 
</p><p>Barbossa: And each pirate only ever votes for hisself. 
</p><p>Jack: I call for a vote. 
</p><p>Ammand: I vote for Ammand, the corsair. 
</p><p>Chevalle: Capitan Chevalle, the penniless French man. 
</p><p>SeSumbhajee’s assistant: SeSumbhajee votes for SeSumbhajee. 
</p><p>Mistress Cheng: Mistress Cheng. 
</p><p>Jocard: Gentleman Jocard. 
</p><p>Elizabeth: Elizabeth Swann. 
</p><p>Barbossa: Barbossa. 
</p><p>Villanueva: Villanueva. 
</p><p>Jack: Elizabeth Swann. 
</p><p>Elizabeth: What? 
</p><p>Jack: I know, curious isn’t it? 
</p><p>Jocard: Why didn’t you vote for me? 
</p><p>[they all start arguing] 
</p><p>Jack: Am I to understand that you lot will not be keeping to the code, then? 
</p><p>[Capt. Teague breaks a guitar string and the room goes silent] 
</p><p>Mistress Cheng: Very well, what say you Captain Swann, king of the Brethren Court? 
</p><p>Elizabeth: Prepare every vessel that floats. At dawn, we’re at war. 
SeSumbhajee: And so, we shall go to war. 
</p><p>[Barbossa signals Ragetti and he makes off with the pieces of eight. Jack turns to Capt. Teague] 
</p><p>Jack: What? You’ve seen it all, done it all, you survived. That’s the trick, isn’t it? To survive. 
</p><p>Capt. Teague: It’s not just about living forever, Jackie. The trick is, living with yourself, forever. 
</p><p>Jack: How’s mum? 
</p><p>[Teague holds up a shrunken head] 
</p><p>Jack: She looks great. 
</p><p>SCENE 15: Battle of the Maelstrom 
</p><p>[opens on crew on deck of Black Pearl, watching the Endeavour emerge from the mist] 
</p><p>Marty: The enemy’s here! Let’s take her! [the rest of the armada emerges from the fog] 
</p><p>Cotton’s parrot: Abandon ship! Abandon ship! 
</p><p>Jack: Parlay? 
</p><p>[cuts to Jack, Elizabeth, and Barbossa walking up to Beckett, Will, and Davy who is standing in a bucket of water on a sand spit] 
</p><p>Barbossa: You be the cur that led these wolves to our door. 
</p><p>Beckett: Don’t blame Turner, he was merely the tool of your betrayal. If you wish to see its grand architect, look to your left. 
</p><p>[they all look left including Jack who is all the way left] 
</p><p>Jack: My hands are clean in this... figuratively. 
</p><p>Will: My actions were my own and to my own purpose. Jack had nothing to do with it. 
</p><p>Jack: Well spoke, listen to the tool. 
</p><p>Elizabeth: Will, I’ve been aboard the Dutchman, I understand the burden you bear, but I fear that cause is lost. 
</p><p>Will: No cause is lost if there is but one fool left to fight for it. 
</p><p>Beckett: If Turner was not acting on your behalf, then how did he come to give me this? You made a deal with me, Jack, to deliver the pirates, and here they are. Don’t be bashful, step up, claim your reward. [tosses Jack compass] 
</p><p>Davy Jones: Your debt to me is still to be satisfied. One hundred years in service aboard the Dutchman. As a start. 
</p><p>Jack: That debt was paid, mate, with [motions to Elizabeth] help. 
</p><p>Davy Jones: You escaped! 
</p><p>Jack: Technically... 
</p><p>Elizabeth: I propose an exchange. Will leaves with us, and you can take Jack. 
</p><p>Will: Done. 
</p><p>Jack: Undone. 
</p><p>Beckett: Done. 
</p><p>Barbossa: Jack is one of the nine pirate lords, you have no right... 
</p><p>Elizabeth: King. 
</p><p>Jack: As you command. [takes off his hat and bows to Elizabeth] 
</p><p>[Barbossa cuts off Jack’s piece of eight, and Jack the monkey runs over and gets it] 
</p><p>Barbossa: If you be sayin’ something, I might be sayin’ something as well. 
</p><p>Jack: First to the finish, then? 
</p><p>[Jack and Will switch and Jack stands by Davy] 
</p><p>Davy Jones&#160;: Do you fear death? 
</p><p>Jack: You have no idea. 
</p><p>Beckett [to Elizabeth]: Advise your brethren, you can fight and all of you will die, or you can not fight in which case only most of you will die.
</p><p>Elizabeth: You murdered my father. 
</p><p>Beckett: He chose his own fate. 
</p><p>Elizabeth: And you have chosen yours. We will fight, and you will die. 
[walks off] 
</p><p>Beckett: So be it. 
</p><p>Will: King? 
</p><p>Elizabeth: Of the Brethren Court. Courtesy of Jack. 
</p><p>Will: Maybe he really does know what he’s doing. 
</p><p>[cut to Jack in the brig of the Flying Dutchman talking to two Jack replicas] 
</p><p>Jack replica: Bravo! You’ve successfully arrived aboard the Flying Dutchman as per the overall scheme. 
</p><p>Jack replica: Oh, yes, chapeau, mate. Except for this little sojourn in the brig, everything’s like clockwork. 
</p><p>Jack: Go away! 
</p><p>Jack replica: Or back to the locker? 
</p><p>Jack replica: But without you, Jackie? 
</p><p>Jack replica [emerges from wall and takes out his brain]: Stab the heart, and live forever, as captain of the Flying Dutchman. Then again, if you’re in the brig, who’s to stab the heart? 
</p><p>Jack replica: It does put immortality a bit out of reach. 
Jack replica: [pulls peanut from real Jack’s hair]: Peanut [eats it] 
</p><p>[cuts to deck of Black Pearl] 
</p><p>Elizabeth: We’ll use the Black Pearl as a flagship to lead the attack. 
</p><p>Barbossa: Will we, now? [Pintel and Ragetti bring Tia, bound in ropes, up from below] 
</p><p>Pintel: All right, Mrs. Fish, c’mon. 
</p><p>Will: Barbossa, you can’t release her. 
</p><p>Elizabeth: We have to give Jack a chance. 
</p><p>Barbossa: Apologies, your majesty! Too long me fate has not been in my own hands - no longer. [pulls Sao Feng’s necklace off Elizabeth and drops it in bowl with other pieces of eight] 
</p><p>[cuts to deck of Endeavour] 
</p><p>Beckett: The enemy has opted for oblivion. Ready the fleet. 
</p><p>Officer: To your stations! 
</p><p>[back to Black Pearl] 
</p><p>Gibbs: Be there some sort of rite or incantation? 
</p><p>Barbossa: Aye. Items to be brought together... done. Items to be burned. And someone must speak the words, “Calypso, I release you from your human bonds.” 
</p><p>Pintel: That’s it? 
</p><p>Barbossa: It was said it must be spoken as if to a lover. 
</p><p>[laughing] 
</p><p>Barbossa: Calypso, I release you from your human bonds. 
</p><p>[he attempts to light the items but nothing happens] 
</p><p>Pintel: Is that it? 
</p><p>Ragetti: You didn’t say it right. You have to say it right. Calypso, I release you from your human bonds. 
</p><p>[the bowl levitates and the items catch fire] 
</p><p>Will: Tia Dalma. Calypso. [bowl falls] When the Brethren Court first imprisoned you, who was it that told them how? Who was it that betrayed you? 
</p><p>Tia Dalma: Name him! 
</p><p>Will: Davy Jones. 
</p><p>[Tia starts to blow up as if attached to an air hose] 
</p><p>Pintel: This is it! This is it! 
</p><p>[Tia grows to huge size] 
</p><p>Barbossa: Calypso, I come before you as a servant, humble and contrite. I have fulfilled me vow, and now ask your favor. Spare meself, me ship, me crew, but unleash your fury upon those who dare pretend themselves your masters, or mine. 
</p><p>[Tia roars ‘My fishes’ and then some unintelligible words. She turns into a bunch of crabs that fall overboard] 
</p><p>Will: Was that it? 
</p><p>Pintel: Why, she’s no help at all. What now? 
</p><p>Barbossa: Nothing. Our final hope has failed us. 
</p><p>Elizabeth: It’s not over. 
</p><p>Will: There’s still a fight to be had. 
</p><p>Gibbs: We’ve an armada against us, and with the Dutchman, there’s no chance. 
</p><p>Elizabeth: Only a fool’s chance. 
</p><p>Barbossa: Revenge won’t bring your father back, Miss Swann, and it’s not something I’m intending to die for. 
</p><p>Elizabeth: You’re right. Then what shall we die for? [to crew] You will listen to me. Listen! The brethren will still be looking here to us, to the Black Pearl to lead, and what will they see? Frightened bilge rats aboard a derelict ship? No! They will see free men, and freedom. And what the enemy will see is the flash of our cannons, they will hear the ring of 
our swords and they will know what we can do! By the sweat of our brows, and the strength of our backs, and the courage of our hearts... gentlemen, hoist the colors! 
</p><p>Will: Hoist the colors. 
</p><p>Ragetti: Hoist the colors! 
</p><p>Pintel: Hoist the colors! 
</p><p>Gibbs: The wind’s on our side, boys, that’s all we need! 
</p><p>Elizabeth: Hoist the colors!!! 
</p><p>[all the pirate ships raise their flags] 
</p><p>[cut to deck of Endeavour] 
</p><p>Officer: We have a favorable wind, sir. 
</p><p>Beckett [drinking tea]: Oh, so we do. Signal Jones to give no quarter. That should brighten his day. [Officer signals; cut to deck of Flying Dutchman] 
</p><p>Mercer: To arms! We give no quarter! 
</p><p>Davy Jones [looks up at brewing storm]: Calypso. [yells] 
</p><p>[cut back to deck of Black Pearl] 
</p><p>Pintel: Have you noticed, on top of everything, it’s raining!?! 
</p><p>Ragetti: That’s a bad sign. 
</p><p>Gibbs: Man the capstan... keep that powder dry! [looks to port and sees humongous whirlpool forming] Maelstrom! 
</p><p>Elizabeth: Captain Barbossa, we need you at the helm. 
</p><p>Barbossa: Aye, that be true! [takes wheel] ...brace up the yards, ya cockeyed deck apes... dyin’ is a day worth livin’ for! 
</p><p>[cuts back to deck of Flying Dutchman] 
</p><p>Mercer: Veer out! 
</p><p>Davy Jones: She’ll not harm us. Full bore and into the abyss! 
</p><p>Mercer: Are you mad? 
</p><p>Davy Jones: Ha! You afraid to get wet? 
</p><p>[back to Pearl] 
</p><p>Will: On our stern and gaining! 
</p><p>Barbossa: More speed! Haul your wind and hold your water! 
</p><p>[back to Flying Dutchman] 
</p><p>Davy: Bow cannons! 
</p><p>[back to Pearl] 
</p><p>Will: Take her out or she’ll overbear us! 
</p><p>Barbossa: Nay, farther in! We’ll cut across to faster waters! 
</p><p>Elizabeth: Prepare to broadside! 
</p><p>Gibbs: Captain the guns! 
</p><p>Will: At the ready! 
</p><p>[cut back to Jack in brig of Dutchman. He and Jack replicas are pacing 
around the cell.] 
</p><p>Jack: Think like the whelp... think like the whelp... think like the whelp... half barrel hinges... leverage! [takes large piece of splintered wood and pries door free] Wish me luck, boys, I’ll need it. [runs off] 
</p><p>Jack replica: I miss him already. 
</p><p>Jack replica: He is quite charming, isn’t he? 
</p><p>Jack replica in wall: Nobody move! I dropped me brain. 
</p><p>[cut back to deck of Pearl] 
</p><p>Gibbs: Batten down the hatches! Stick to your guns! Sight the flash! 
</p><p>[cut to Mercer, who yells something unintelligible; back to Gibbs] 
</p><p>Gibbs [to Pintel and Ragetti]: Hold it! Wait till we’re more to port! 
</p><p>Barbossa: Fire! 
</p><p>Elizabeth: Fire! 
</p><p>Will: Fire! 
</p><p>[Flying Dutchman] 
</p><p>Davy Jones: Fire! 
</p><p>[Pearl] 
</p><p>Barbossa: It’s too late to alter course now, mateys! Ha ha ha ha! 
</p><p>[cut to Davy’s cabin, where Murtogg and Mullroy are guarding the chest. Enter Jack.] 
</p><p>Mullroy: Hold it or I’ll shoot! [cannonball blasts through cabin] 
</p><p>Jack: Good one. I just came to get me effects. Admirable though it may be, why are you here when you could be elsewhere? 
</p><p>Murtogg: Someone has to stay and guard the chest. [they point their cannons back at chest] 
</p><p>Mullroy: There is no question, there has been a breakdown in military discipline aboard this vessel. 
</p><p>Murtogg: I blame the fish people. 
</p><p>Mullroy: Oh! So fish people, by dint of being fish people, automatically aren’t as disciplined as non-fish people? 
</p><p>Murtogg: Seems contributory, is all I’m suggesting. 
</p><p>Mullroy:It is true, if there were no fish people, there would be no need to guard the chest. 
</p><p>Murtogg: And if there were no chest, we wouldn’t need to be here to guard it. [They look and the chest and Jack are gone.] 
</p><p>[cut to deck of Flying Dutchman] 
</p><p>Mercer: Prepare to board! 
Davy Jones [sees cannonball coming]: Cover! [grabs Mercer] 
</p><p>[Cannonball blasts a bunch of soldiers. Davy kills Mercer via tentacular strangulation, then takes the key to the chest. Davy goes downstairs towards his cabin just as Jack is emerging with the chest.] 
</p><p>Davy Jones: Lookie here, boys. A lost bird. A lost bird that never learned to fly. 
</p><p>Jack: To my great regret. But, never to late to learn, eh? [whacks rope and goes flying up onto top of one of Dutchman’s sails. Davy emerges from the mast.] 
</p><p>Davy Jones: The chest! Hand it over! 
</p><p>Jack: I can set you free, mate. 
</p><p>Davy: My freedom was forfeit long ago. Aaaahhh! [they swordfight] 
</p><p>[shot of sailors swinging between ships across maelstrom] 
</p><p>[deck of Black Pearl] 
</p><p>Will: Elizabeth! Elizabeth! Will you marry me? 
</p><p>Elizabeth: I don’t think now is the best time! 
</p><p>Will: Now may be the only time! I love you. I’ve made my choice. What’s yours? 
</p><p>Elizabeth: Barbossa! Marry us! 
</p><p>Barbossa: I’m a little busy at the moment! 
</p><p>Will: Barbossa! Now! 
</p><p>Barbossa: Fine then! [gets up on table] Dearly beloved, we be gathered here today... 
</p><p>Will: Elizabeth Swann, do you take me to be your husband? 
</p><p>Elizabeth: I do. 
</p><p>Will: Great! 
</p><p>Elizabeth: Will Turner, do you take me...to be your wife, in sickness and in health, with health being the less likely? 
</p><p>Will: I do. 
</p><p>Barbossa: As captain, I now pronounce you... you may kiss... you may kiss... just kiss! [Will and Elizabeth kiss as Pintel, Ragetti, and Jack the monkey look on] 
</p><p>[cut back to deck of Flying Dutchman, where Murtogg and Mullroy are emerging from Davy’s cabin] 
</p><p>Murtogg [to Mullroy]: Just leave it! 
</p><p>[cut to Jack and Davy fighting up in the rigging] 
</p><p>Davy Jones: You can do nothing without the key! 
</p><p>Jack: I already have the key. 
</p><p>Davy Jones [shows key]: No, you don’t. 
</p><p>Jack: Oh, that key. [cuts off Davy’s tentacle that is holding key, and it falls down below] 
</p><p>Davy Jones: Aaaaahhh! [breaks Jack’s sword with his crab claw] [Boat lurches, Jack falls and catches bottom of chest, Davy catches top of chest. Davy gives chest a heave and Jack goes flying, is caught by Clanker swinging by on a rope.] 
</p><p>Jack [to Clanker]: Oy! My pistol. [hits Clanker with pistol, then shoots chest out of Davy’s hand, it falls on Hadras’ head and he falls overboard] 
[Will swings over from Pearl to Dutchman, sees chest and picks it up] 
</p><p>Maccus: Turner! 
</p><p>[Pintel and Ragetti shoot Jack the monkey out of the cannon and a flaming undead monkey hits Maccus in the face, and he falls overboard.] 
</p><p>Will: Thank you, Jack. [Bootstrap attacks Will] It’s me! It’s Will, your son! [Bootstrap doesn’t recognize him, continues to attack.] 
</p><p>[Jack drops to deck in front of Davy, pulls sword on him but it is broken. He runs behind Kraken-summoning wheel and he and Davy go back and forth a few times, then Davy walks into center of wheel. Jack spins it like a merry-go-round, Davy roars and shakes his tentacles and Jack yells and runs away.] 
</p><p>[Murtogg and Mullroy try to swing on rope over to Black Pearl but go splat on the side] 
</p><p>Gibbs [to Elizabeth]: Go! [she swings over to Dutchman] 
</p><p>[Davy hits Jack and he falls] 
</p><p>Davy Jones [to Elizabeth]: All right, then! You’ll see no mercy from me! 
</p><p>Elizabeth: That’s why I brought this! [pulls sword] 
</p><p>Will [to Bootstrap]: I’m not going to kill you. I made you a promise. [stabs Bootstrap’s knife into railing] 
</p><p>[Davy goes after Elizabeth so Will stabs him with his sword.] 
</p><p>Davy Jones: Mister, did you forget? I’m a heartless wretch. [kicks Will down, then looks back and forth between Will and Elizabeth] Ahhh, love. A dreadful bond. And yet so easily severed. Tell me, William Turner, do you fear death? 
</p><p>Jack: Do you? [holding Davy’s heart, which is bleeding] Heady tonic, holding life and death in the palm of one’s hand. 
</p><p>Davy Jones: You’re a cruel man, Jack Sparrow. 
</p><p>Jack: Cruel is a matter of perspective. 
</p><p>Davy Jones: Is it, now? [spins around and stabs Will in the chest with his sword, then laughs] 
</p><p>Elizabeth [runs over to Will]: Will! Will! Look at me! Stay with me! You’re all right! [Jack looks at Davy’s heart and hesitates] 
</p><p>Bootstrap: William! My son! [fights with Davy] 
</p><p>Elizabeth: Will! Will! Look at me! Look at me! 
</p><p>Davy Jones [to Bootstrap]: You will not forestall my judgment! [shows his heart stabbed through with Jack’s broken sword. Davy’s tentacles twitch, he looks around to see Will holding Jack’s broken sword with Jack’s help.] Calypso! [Davy falls overboard into maelstrom] 
</p><p>[deck of Black Pearl] 
</p><p>Barbossa: She’s takin’ us down! Make quick, or it’s the locker for us all! 
</p><p>[Flying Dutchman] 
</p><p>Elizabeth [as Will dies]: No! no! no! no! 
</p><p>Davy’s crew: Part of the crew, part of the ship... 
</p><p>Elizabeth: Don’t leave me! I won’t leave you! [Jack grabs her] 
</p><p>[shows empty inside of Davy’s chest] 
</p><p>Bootstrap: The Dutchman must have a captain. [raises knife] 
</p><p>[Jack, Elizabeth, and Jack the monkey parachute over to near the Pearl. The Dutchman is swallowed up by the maelstrom. Jack and Elizabeth climb aboard the Pearl.] 
</p><p>Gibbs: Jack, the armada’s still out there, the Endeavour’s coming up hard to starboard, and I think it’s time we embraced that oldest and noblest of pirate traditions... 
</p><p>Jack: Never actually been one for tradition... Close haul her. Luff the sails and lay on iron! 
</p><p>Barbossa: Belay that, or we’ll be a sitting duck. 
</p><p>Jack: Belay that ‘belay that.’ 
</p><p>Gibbs [tries to interrupt]: But captain... 
</p><p>Jack: Belay! 
</p><p>Gibbs: The armada... 
</p><p>Jack: Belay! 
</p><p>Gibbs: The Endeavour... 
</p><p>Jack: Belay! 
</p><p>Gibbs: But we... 
</p><p>Jack: Stow. Shut it! [Gibbs shuts up] 
</p><p>[cut to deck of Endeavour] 
</p><p>Officer: What is he waiting for? 
</p><p>Beckett: He actually expects us to honor our agreement. Nothing personal, Jack... it’s just good business. 
</p><p>[Dutchman surfaces] 
</p><p>Beckett: Ahh, she survived. 
</p><p>[cut to deck of Dutchman, where sea creatures are dropping off crewmen and they are turning back into humans.] 
</p><p>Will: Ready on the guns! 
</p><p>[Pearl] 
</p><p>Jack: Full canvas! 
</p><p>Barbossa: Aye, full canvas! 
</p><p>[Dutchman and Pearl sail in tandem on either side of Endeavour] 
</p><p>Officer: Orders, sir? Sir? 
</p><p>[Pearl] 
</p><p>Gibbs: Cap’n? 
</p><p>Jack: Fire! 
</p><p>Gibbs: Fire! 
</p><p>[Dutchman] 
</p><p>Will: Fire! 
</p><p>[Pearl] 
</p><p>Elizabeth: Fire all! [Dutchman and Pearl begin to blast Endeavour to smithereens] 
</p><p>[Endeavour] 
</p><p>Officer: Orders?! Orders, sir?! Sir, what do you command? 
</p><p>Beckett [stunned and detached]: It’s just good business... 
</p><p>Officer: Abandon ship! 
</p><p>[Beckett descends stairs, Endeavour explodes as powder magazine ignites, Beckett’s body falls into water on top of East India Co. flag] 
</p><p>Marty: They’re turning away! [cheers] 
</p><p>Cotton’s parrot: Wind in your sails! 
</p><p>Mullroy: Shiver me timbers! Arrrrrhh! [Pintel shrugs] 
</p><p>Jack: Mr. Gibbs, you may throw my hat if you like. 
</p><p>Gibbs: Aye aye captain! [tosses Jack’s hat] Hooray! 
</p><p>Jack: Now go and get it. 
</p><p>[cut to deck of Flying Dutchman where Will is gazing wistfully off at Elizabeth on the Black Pearl] 
</p><p>Bootstrap: Orders, sir. 
</p><p>Will: You’re no longer bound to the Dutchman. You’re free. 
</p><p>Bootstrap: Aye, that’s a fine thing, but, by my reckoning, I still have a debt that has to be paid... if you’ll have me. 
</p><p>Will: On the wheel, then, Mr. Turner. 
</p><p>Bootstrap: Aye, Captain Turner. [Will still gazes longingly at Elizabeth] This ship has a purpose again, and where we are bound, she cannot come. One day ashore, ten years at sea. It’s a steep price for what’s been done. 
</p><p>Will: Depends on the one day. 
</p><p>SCENE 16: Farewell 
</p><p>[cut to deck of Black Pearl, where Elizabeth is preparing to leave] 
</p><p>Gibbs: Your chariot awaits, your highness. The oars are inside. 
</p><p>Barbossa: Mrs. Turner. 
</p><p>Pintel: Goodbye, Poppet. 
</p><p>Elizabeth [to Jack]: Jack. It would never have worked out between us. 
</p><p>Jack: Keep telling yourself that, darlin’. [Elizabeth moves to kiss him and he holds up his hands to stop her] Once was quite enough. 
</p><p>Elizabeth: Thank you. 
</p><p>[cut to beach where Will is preparing to leave after his one day ashore] 
</p><p>Will: I’m gonna need the other one. [Elizabeth presents her leg with his boot on it and he takes it off.] It’s nearly sunset. [Hands her the chest] It’s always belonged to you. Will you keep it safe? 
</p><p>Elizabeth: Yes, yes. [Will walks toward shore] Will! [she runs after him and they embrace] 
</p><p>Will: Keep a weather eye on the horizon. [Flying Dutchman sails off into the sunset and disappears in green flash] 
</p><p>[cut to Tortuga docks] 
</p><p>Jack: Granted, it tends to list to port and has on occasion been known to frighten young women, but I guarantee you will not be disappointed. 
</p><p>Giselle: Is that it? 
</p><p>Scarlett: The Black Pearl? 
</p><p>Giselle: It’s not very big. 
</p><p>Jack: That, love, is a dinghy. My vessel is magnificent, and fierce, and huge-ish, and... gone. Why is it gone? 
</p><p>Giselle: Is that it there? 
</p><p>Jack: Yes, there it is. Why is it there? It’s much larger up close. 
</p><p>Scarlett: Jack, you promised to give us a ride. 
</p><p>Giselle: I was to get the first ride! 
</p><p>Scarlett: You? [they begin to shove each other] 
</p><p>Jack [pours beer on Gibbs, who is sleeping on the dock with a burlap Teddy bear]: Mr. Gibbs, any particular reason why my ship is gone? 
</p><p>Gibbs: The ship? We’re on the ship. [wakes] Jack, the ship is gone! 
</p><p>Jack: Really? [turns to Scarlett and Giselle who are still fighting] Ladies, will you please shut it! Listen to me. [to Giselle] Yes, I lied to you. [to Scarlett] No, I don’t love you. [to Giselle] Of course it makes you look fat. [to Scarlett] I’ve never been to Brussels. [to Giselle] It is pronounced egregious. [to Scarlett] And by the way, no, I’ve never actually met 
Pisaro, but I love his pies. And all of this pales into utter insignificance in light of the fact that my ship is once again, gone, savvy? 
</p><p>[Giselle and Scarlett slap Jack, then Jack slaps Gibbs, who gives a look of resignation.] 
</p><p>Gibbs: Take what you can. 
</p><p>Jack: Give nothing back. 
</p><p>Gibbs [to Giselle and Scarlett]: Ladies, what do you know of sea turtles? 
</p><p>[cuts to deck of Black Pearl where Barbossa is feeding a peanut to Jack the monkey] 
</p><p>Barbossa: Ooh, that’s a good boy, you’re Daddy’s boy, yes you are. 
</p><p>Pintel: Sir, some of the men don’t feel entirely settled about leaving Captain Jack behind... 
</p><p>Ragetti [to Pintel]: ...again... 
</p><p>Pintel: ...again. 
</p><p>Barbossa: Is that so? 
</p><p>Pintel: It would make us feel a whole lot better concerning our fortunes if we could see that item you mentioned... 
</p><p>Marty: On the charts. 
</p><p>Murtogg and Mullroy: Aye. 
</p><p>Pintel: With our own eyes. 
</p><p>Ragetti: To ease our burden of guilt, so to speak. 
</p><p>Barbossa [unrolling chart]: Aye. Feast your eyes on this, mateys. There’s more than one way to live forever. Gents, I give you the Fountain of Youth! [crew gets confused looks on their faces and Barbossa holds up chart, which is missing center piece.] Sparrow! 
</p><p>[cuts to Jack in dinghy raising his own pirate flag with a bandanna’d skull and a red flying sparrow, unrolling center of chart] 
Jack [singing]: ....a pirate’s life for me (or maybe "the Pearl is not for me?"). [hums] Drink up, me hearties, yo ho. We’re devils and black sheep, and really bad eggs... [opens compass and it points behind him. He reaches for bottle of rum and uncorks it, then compass points ahead.] Drink up, me hearties, yo ho. [sails off into sunset] 
</p><p>SCENE 17: Ten years later 
</p><p>[Elizabeth and a little boy are waiting on the island for Will to return for shore leave] 
</p><p>Boy [singing]: Yo ho, yo ho, a pirate’s life for me. We pillage, we plunder, we rifle, we loot, drink up, me hearties, yo ho. We kidnap and ravage and don’t give a hoot, drink up, me hearties, yo ho. Yo ho, yo ho, a pirate’s life for me... 
</p><p>[Will comes sailing up.]
