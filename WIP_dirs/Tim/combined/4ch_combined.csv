410,bartlet,"Then I ask again, what is the virtue of a proportional response?",west_wing
411,bartlet,It is not all there is.,west_wing

He could walk across  the earth unharmed, cloaked only in the words ‘Civis Romanis’ I am a Roman citizen.  So great was the retribution of Rome, universally understood as certain, should any  harm befall even one of its citizens. Where was Morris’ protection, or anyone else  on that plane? Where is the retribution for the families and where is the warning to  the rest of the world that Americans shall walk this earth unharmed, lest the  clenched fist of the most mighty military force in the history of mankind comes  crashing down on your house!?

711,bartlet,Hot damn! Now you’re talking.,west_wing
715,bartlet,"Toby, you’re a great writer, do you know that?",west_wing
717,bartlet,Come on. Give us a hug.  There you go.,west_wing
718,bartlet,Charlie’s a great name.,west_wing
719,bartlet,I’m going. I’m going.   I’m seriously thinking about getting a dog.,west_wing
720,bartlet,"Maybe an Irish setter, Charlie. What do you think? ",west_wing
729,bartlet,Why would I want to do that?,west_wing
731,bartlet,"All right, game point. Let’s go.",west_wing
733,bartlet,"Take the ball out, Toby.",west_wing
735,bartlet,Take the ball out. Let’s go.,west_wing
737,bartlet,You want to play or write my eulogy?,west_wing
740,bartlet,I’m making a substitution.,west_wing
741,bartlet,Mr. Grant’s a new member of my team.,west_wing
742,bartlet,Mr. Grant is a federal employee.,west_wing
745,bartlet,When have I ever cheated?,west_wing
748,bartlet,"Well, I will admit that the woman bore a striking resemblance...",west_wing
751,bartlet,"Be that as it may, Toby Ziegler, Josh Lyman, Charlie Young. I would like to  introduce Mr. Rodney Grant. Mr. Grant is Associate Director of the President’s  Council on Physical Fitness. Game point. Your ball. Let’s go!",west_wing

756,bartlet,"Let the poets write about that there, Byron.",west_wing
777,bartlet,"No, Helen, I don’t. The U.S. economy is fundamentally...",west_wing
778,bartlet,From the... Miami Herald?,west_wing
779,bartlet,"But, your voice sounded the same as when you did Helen.",west_wing
780,bartlet,"No, not at all. The U.S. economy remains fundamentally strong as the steady decline  in unemployment reflects, which I think is cause for satisfaction, not gloom. The  solitary aberrant spike in the P.P.I. is not cause for overreaction.",west_wing
781,bartlet,"I AM an economics professor with a big old stick up my butt, but I’ll do my best for  you there, Mandy.",west_wing
782,bartlet,We don’t need to do guns.,west_wing

786,bartlet, Is it time for my 10 a.m. scolding?,west_wing
787,bartlet,Ah! Mr. Ziegler from the Coney Island Killjoy. You have a follow up?,west_wing
790,bartlet,‘Cause I’m weak-willed and stupid.,west_wing
792,bartlet,Then I talked it over with some other people.,west_wing
793,bartlet,I have lots of other people.,west_wing
799,bartlet,I’m not gonna come out and say the bill we just passed is worthless.,west_wing
801,bartlet,"Yeah, my answer was gonna be “because I said so,” but you did pretty good.",west_wing
804,bartlet," Well, on behalf of everybody in the west wing, Toby, let me just  say that that’s a relief.",west_wing
806,bartlet, I think this press conference is about we haven’t had a press  conference in a while.,west_wing
811,bartlet,Leo’s not talking about the portion being accounted for as off budget and  particularly not the long-term capital outlays.,west_wing
812,bartlet,"Ten years ago, the federal budget had a deficit of 22 billion dollars but the  national debt rose... ",west_wing
813,bartlet, Zoey’s coming for dinner.,west_wing
814,bartlet,"Yeah.  My daughter’s starting Georgetown after the first and  she’s scouting off-campus housing. Guys, we’re done. I’m sorry, but some of my staff  has been waiting and they haven’t had the chance to bother me for a couple of hours.  Thanks so much.",west_wing
815,bartlet,I’ll make it for everybody. Charlie!,west_wing
816,bartlet,"My friends, my daughter, my beer, and some chili. Yes!",west_wing
817,bartlet,"Ah, Charlie. My youngest daughter, Zoey, is down from Hanover. I’m making chili  tonight. It’s her favorite.",west_wing
818,bartlet,The first lady’s in Pakistan. I can eat whatever I want.,west_wing
819,bartlet,I’m gonna need some ingredients.,west_wing
820,bartlet,"Don’t ever listen to him. Look, Mrs. Landingham’s got it all written down somewhere.  Just tell her to give it to the steward’s office. And send everyone else in.",west_wing
821,bartlet,"Everyone! Come in. Come on in. Hey, listen up everybody. Zoey’s down from Hanover.  I’m making chili for everyone tonight.",west_wing
822,bartlet, All right...You know what? Let’s do this. Everybody  look down at the big seal in the middle of my carpet.,west_wing
823,bartlet,"Now, everybody look back up at me. Zoey’s coming down from Hanover and I’m making  chili for everyone tonight.",west_wing
824,bartlet,"There, you see how benevolent I can be, when everyone does what I tell them to do.  Now sit down. ",west_wing
829,bartlet, Cause it’s Hollywood. Who gives a damn?,west_wing
832,bartlet,"Because Sam is right. It’s not that Larry Posner’s movies have gratuitous sex and  gratuitous violence. It’s that they suck. They’re terrible. But people go to see them  because they have gratuitous sex and gratuitous violence. Now, if we could just get  people to stop going to see crappy movies, Posner would stop making them. I promise you.",west_wing
835,bartlet," Do I look like Joe McCarthy to you, Toby?",west_wing
910,bartlet,"Sam, it’s all about mastering the fundamentals, see? Got to keep your hands up,  your feet moving on defense. Pass and get open or find the open man, and follow his  shot on offense. See, I am a master of fundamentals, and that is why my team so  thoroughly dominated your team.",west_wing
911,bartlet," Leo, kids don’t understand the fundamentals.",west_wing
912,bartlet,"Mrs. Landingham, are you drunk?",west_wing
913,bartlet,"Oh, give it up. Where’s Zoey? ",west_wing
923,bartlet,"We were up all night on that one, Toby. Me and Leo and Josh. They were screaming  at me, “Governor, for God’s sakes, it’s got to be Toby. It’s got to be Toby.” When  I held my ground, and we went to David Rosen, and Rosen said he wanted to take a  partnership at Solomon Brothers, thank God... I couldn’t live without you Toby.  I mean it. I’d be in the tall grass. I’d be in the weeds... I know I disappoint you  sometimes. I mean I can sense your disappointment. And I only get mad because I know  you’re right a lot of the times, but you are not the kid in the class with his hand  up and whatever it was you said to C.J. You are a wise and brilliant man, Toby...  The other night when we were playing basketball, did you mean what you said? My  demons were shouting down the better angels in my brain?",west_wing
924,bartlet,You think that’s what’s stopping me from greatness?,west_wing
925,bartlet,I suppose you’re right.,west_wing
927,bartlet,"Thank you, Toby.  Now, go away.",west_wing
935,bartlet,Josh! We’ve been looking for you.,west_wing
936,bartlet,"Look at this, will you?",west_wing
937,bartlet,"I don’t know why, but nothing makes me feel quite so good as the sight of colleagues,  enjoying each other outside work.",west_wing
939,bartlet,We were talking about these women.,west_wing
942,bartlet,"Uh, excuse me! Thank you. Uh, friends, please... Well, chili’s ready and I hope  you all enjoy it. In fact, since I told you you would enjoy it, I’m reasonably  certain that you will. ",west_wing
943,bartlet,"It’s an incredible adventure you’re starting on, sweetheart. An amazing four years  full of people and experiences you haven’t yet dreamed of. And if you will allow me  just one minute of business, please. I hope that by the time we’re done with our  four years here, we’ll have seen to it that every young person who chooses can go  to college and beyond, regardless of their economic status.",west_wing
947,bartlet,There is one fruit whose seeds are on the outside. Name it please.,west_wing
950,bartlet,"Yes you did Toby, and I thought it was a bold move when you consider that Leo’s  holding the six you’re looking for.",west_wing
952,bartlet,There are fourteen punctuation marks in Standard English grammar. Can anyone name  them please?,west_wing
953,bartlet,That’s only seven. There are seven more.,west_wing
956,bartlet,"There are three words, and three words only in the English language that begin with  the letters DW.",west_wing
958,bartlet,Can anyone name them for me please?,west_wing
960,bartlet,I see you five and raise you five by the way.,west_wing
961,bartlet,"“Witches brew a magic spell, in an enchanted forest where fairies...”",west_wing

968,bartlet,"Charlie, I’m headed over to the residence, you’re done for the night.",west_wing
969,bartlet,Don’t stay up too late son.,west_wing
973,bartlet,All right.  What body of water in South America is formed by the  confluence...?,west_wing
975,bartlet,Not quite up on your South American geography are you my friend?,west_wing
1003,bartlet,What tripped the alarm?,west_wing
1004,bartlet,It wasn’t a fraternity stunt?,west_wing
1005,bartlet,"Well, you know, just trying to kill me isn’t necessarily evidence of being mentally  unbalanced!",west_wing
1006,bartlet,You know Ron Butterfield?,west_wing
1007,bartlet,He says it was a woman!,west_wing
1008,bartlet,Of course.  This woman was after Zoey?,west_wing
1009,bartlet,There’s no need for Zoey to know about this right? ,west_wing
1010,bartlet,Hang on a second. What’ve you got Ron?,west_wing
1011,bartlet,"Well, I guess that’s something.",west_wing
1012,bartlet, I guess we’re done too.,west_wing
1035,bartlet, I’m on a conference call with the  postmaster general.,west_wing
1036,bartlet,I honestly couldn’t tell you.,west_wing
1037,bartlet,"Look, I want you to do me a favor.",west_wing
1038,bartlet,Take Charlie out for a beer tonight.,west_wing
1040,bartlet,"Yeah. The kid has no life. You’re the only guy around here he knows at all. Take him  out for a couple of beers, you guys come back, we’ll all watch the vote in Leo’s office.",west_wing
1041,bartlet,"Good, thanks. Let me give you some cash.",west_wing
1043,bartlet,"Truth be known, I don’t have any cash on me.",west_wing
1044,bartlet,I don’t carry cash anymore. I don’t carry keys either.,west_wing
1046,bartlet,How’s it going in there?,west_wing
1088,bartlet,"I’ll take the call wherever I am when he calls, I guess.",west_wing
1089,bartlet,I’m not adopting a tone. I’m just trying to get out of here.,west_wing
1090,bartlet,I’m saying no. I just want to go home.,west_wing
1091,bartlet,Goodnight Mrs. Landingham.  I heard it’s done?,west_wing
1092,bartlet,Good. I’m headed over to the residence.,west_wing
1093,bartlet,"Leo, you’re kidding me?!",west_wing
1094,bartlet,"Don’t tell me nothing happened, Leo. I know you. I know Jenny. Married couples  like you don’t just get divorced. Not cause nothing happened!",west_wing
1095,bartlet,I want to talk to Jenny.,west_wing
1096,bartlet,I don’t understand how this happened Leo. You and Jenny were happy!,west_wing
1097,bartlet,Because you weren’t spending enough time with her? ,west_wing
1098,bartlet,Marriage needs attention Leo. It can’t run on autopilot. Come on. It’s not your  prom date we’re talking about here. We’re talking about your family!,west_wing
1099,bartlet,You can’t blame this on me.,west_wing
1100,bartlet,And you’re just now telling me?,west_wing
1101,bartlet,It IS as simple as that. You’re the man. Fix it. ,west_wing
1127,bartlet,Did you do anything at all to provoke these guys? ,west_wing
1128,bartlet,Were you flirting with them?,west_wing
1129,bartlet,"Zoey, you flirt with guys.",west_wing
1130,bartlet,So what were you doing?,west_wing
1131,bartlet,What the hell were you doing drinking?,west_wing
1132,bartlet,I’m gonna up your protection.,west_wing
1133,bartlet,Well you’ll have plenty of friends to walk you to class.,west_wing
1134,bartlet,You’re getting this part of your life.,west_wing
1135,bartlet,"Look, the Secret Service...",west_wing
1136,bartlet,"They are worried about me getting shot. I’m worried about me getting shot. But that  is nothing compared to how terrified we are of you. You scare the hell out of the  Secret Service Zoey, and you scare the hell out of me too. My getting killed would  be bad enough, but that is not the nightmare scenario. The nightmare scenario,  sweetheart, is YOU getting kidnapped. You go out to a bar or a party in some club,  and you get up to go to the restroom, somebody comes up from behind, puts their  hand across your mouth, and whisks you out the back door. You’re so petrified, you  don’t even notice the bodies of two secret service agents lying on the ground with  bullet holes in their heads. Then you’re whisked away in a car. It’s a big party  with lots of noise, and lots of people coming and going. And It’s a half hour  before someone says, “Hey where’s Zoey?” Another 15 minutes before the first phone  call. Another hour and a half before anyone even THINKS to shut down all the  airports. Now we’re off to the races. You’re tied to a chair in a cargo shack,  somewhere in the middle of Uganda. And I’m told that I have 72 hours to get Israel  to free 460 terrorist prisoners. So I’m on the phone pleading with Benjamin and  he’s saying, “I’m sorry Mr. President, but Israel simply does not negotiate with  terrorists, period. It’s the only way we can survive.” So now we’ve got a new  problem, because this country no longer has a commander in chief, it has a father  who’s out of his mind because his little girl is in a shack somewhere in Uganda  with a gun to her head. DO YOU GET IT?!",west_wing
1137,bartlet," I’m sorry I yelled sweetheart. Forgive me. Honey, I want you to have  your freedom and your youth. I want you to have common everyday experiences with  girls your own age. But don’t ever forget - this is a privilege, and it is an  experience that must be cherished beyond measure. And proper protection and  security, though at times I admit, it’s a drag, is never too high a price to pay.",west_wing
1138,bartlet,It’s alright sweetheart. It’s alright.,west_wing
1139,bartlet,"Goodnight, sweetheart. I love you.",west_wing
1140,bartlet,"Hi. Before, when I was being an idiot, there was something I forgot to say.",west_wing
1141,bartlet,I would like unanimous consent to revise and extend my remarks.,west_wing
1142,bartlet,"I don’t know what the hell was the matter with me, Leo. If there’s anything I can  do to help, anything?",west_wing
1149,bartlet,What were you doing taking my daughter out to a bar? ,west_wing
1150,bartlet,I told you to take Charlie. When Zoey said she was going I just assumed you were  gonna go have malteds or something.,west_wing
1152,bartlet,Well anyway. Thank you for doing whatever it was you did.,west_wing
1154,bartlet," Charlie? Sam, you come too please.",west_wing
1155,bartlet," You know, I once played the stage manager in a production of Our Town.",west_wing

1208,bartlet,"She’s not worried about the length of your question, she’s worried about the length  of my response.",west_wing
1209,bartlet,We’re having salmon tonight. ,west_wing
1210,bartlet,Yo-yo Ma is going to play.  Do you like salmon?,west_wing
1224,bartlet,She’d like you to say a little more on the subject. ,west_wing
1226,bartlet,"I try not to look out my window that much, Danny. What protestors? ",west_wing
1231,bartlet,"I can’t decide if that man is boring or rude, but he’s one or the other. ",west_wing
1232,bartlet,"I’m sitting out there trying to figure out how this guy campaign for something  and win, then I remembered--we usually rig the elections. ",west_wing
1233,bartlet,You think it’s important he sit at my table tonight? ,west_wing
1234,bartlet,"Ah, that’s the fun table. ",west_wing
1235,bartlet,Because of the hurricane?,west_wing
1236,bartlet,Sorry to keep you waiting.  Did I mention we’re having salmon tonight?,west_wing
1257,bartlet,You want to raid this house?,west_wing
1260,bartlet,"All right, Mandy. Thank you. Josh? Would you two give us a minute, please?",west_wing
1296,bartlet,The hurricane just shifted direction without any warning?,west_wing
1297,bartlet,Captain? How big is this carrier group? How many men and how many ships?,west_wing
1298,bartlet,How soon before the worst of it starts?,west_wing
1299,bartlet,Is there any way I can speak with the fleet commander? ,west_wing
1300,bartlet,All right. Let’s do it.,west_wing
1301,bartlet,Any word on the FBI guy’s condition?,west_wing
1327,bartlet,Talk to me for five minutes apiece and then we’re going to settle this. ,west_wing
1328,bartlet,"Yes, I know. But I got tired of listening to you. Now you listen to me. I have a Nobel Prize  in Economics and I’m here to tell you that none of you know what the hell you’re talking  about. At 12:01 am, I’m using my executive power to nationalize the trucking industry.",west_wing
1329,bartlet,Fourteen White House lawyers disagree. Truman did it in ‘52 with the coalmine.,west_wing
1330,bartlet,"In 50 years, there’s a new bench and I’ll take my chances. As for Labor, I am calling  Congress into Emergency Session to grant me the authority to draft the truckers into  military service. You’re going to love our food. Nice talking to you folks. If this  isn’t settled in 47 minutes, don’t worry. We know where to find you. ",west_wing
1331,bartlet,I approved a plan for an FBI negotiator.,west_wing
1332,bartlet,"What the hell? Well, if this isn’t a metaphor for powerlessness, I don’t know what is.  We better get back to work, huh?",west_wing
1333,bartlet,We got the fleet commander?,west_wing
1334,bartlet,"So, I guess I’m going to talk to the Captain of the Hickory?",west_wing

1346,bartlet,Can you tell us what’s going on?,west_wing

1503,bartlet,"Margaret!  Hey, you’re all dressed up.",west_wing
1504,bartlet,"Yes, uh, could you bring me the chief of staff’s schedule for today, please?",west_wing
1505,bartlet,"Thank you.  You look a little glum, Mallory. Did you have plans to go  out this evening with someone who had to cancel due to circumstances beyond their control  because they have made a commitment to a common and higher purpose?",west_wing
1506,bartlet,"Oh, thank you Margaret.  How’d that go by the way?",west_wing
1507,bartlet,"Cool. He received a security briefing, a Central American briefing, and wrote a position  paper, and he’s been counseling me throughout the day of a bad decision I have to make.  Oh, and by the way, this was a very light day.",west_wing
1508,bartlet,Uh... that’s a perfectly fair question.,west_wing
1509,bartlet," Oh, my point is... give your dad a break. He’s your father.",west_wing
1510,bartlet,Are you blowing me off?,west_wing
1511,bartlet,Good. What can I do for you?,west_wing
1512,bartlet,C.J. already talked to Danny Concannon. I think we’re fine.,west_wing
1513,bartlet,"Well, that’s a different story.",west_wing
1514,bartlet,"You shouldn’t have made me beg, John. I was asking you to be Vice President.",west_wing
1515,bartlet,"Then don’t stand there and ask the question, John. It weakened me right out of the gate.  You shouldn’t have made me beg.",west_wing
1535,bartlet,"Both black and grizzly bears inhabit Glacier Park, Charlie. And hikers are told to talk  or sing along the trail to keep them at bay.",west_wing
1536,bartlet,It’s not as silly as it sounds.,west_wing
1537,bartlet,"Yes, Glacier Park was the tenth. We have 44 to go.",west_wing
1538,bartlet,"Have a good night, Charlie.",west_wing
1540,bartlet,"You understand it’s a bunch of rocks, right?",west_wing
1542,bartlet," More than a right, Josh.",west_wing
1543,bartlet,You would enjoy nature.,west_wing
1545,bartlet,This is simplicity itself.,west_wing
1547,bartlet, Thank you. Good night.,west_wing
1561,bartlet,This is huge. Which one of you is the man?,west_wing
1563,bartlet,"Mrs. Landingham, let’s make the phone call!",west_wing
1586,bartlet,"You’re too young to retire, Joseph.",west_wing
1587,bartlet,He’s on the short list.,west_wing
1588,bartlet,We’ll make our announcement on Thursday.,west_wing
1589,bartlet,"I haven’t made a decision yet, Joseph.",west_wing
1590,bartlet,Mendoza was on the short list.,west_wing
1591,bartlet,"That’s not true, Joseph.",west_wing
1594,bartlet,I suppose we should get out there.,west_wing
1595,bartlet,"I’m sorry Joseph, but I am...",west_wing
1596,bartlet,You’ve said quite a few words.,west_wing
1597,bartlet,"Joseph, when the next seat opens up, I promise you...",west_wing
1598,bartlet,"In three years, I would hope to be running for reel...",west_wing
1599,bartlet,"That’s a little pessimistic, Joseph.",west_wing
1600,bartlet,"You know I imagine the view from your largely unscrutinized place in history must be very  different from mine. But I remind you sir, that I have the following things to negotiate:  an opposition Congress, special interests with power beyond belief, and a bitchy media.",west_wing
1601,bartlet,"Well, I am not Harry Truman.",west_wing
1602,bartlet," It’s “Dr. Bartlet,” your honor. Now, let’s go start your retirement.",west_wing
1651,bartlet,A quick confirmation’s gonna be good for us.,west_wing
1652,bartlet,Just what the doctor ordered.  Thank you.,west_wing
1653,bartlet,"Good morning, Mrs. Landingham.",west_wing
1654,bartlet,When is Harrison getting in?,west_wing
1655,bartlet,"Peyton Cabot Harrison. Find out what kind of cigars he likes, what kind of perfume his  wife likes, and have them sent over to their hotel, okay?",west_wing
1656,bartlet,We’re using back channels. What is going on with Lillienfield?,west_wing
1657,bartlet,"We’re gonna get this done, right?",west_wing
1658,bartlet,"We looked at everybody, right?",west_wing
1659,bartlet,The short list. We looked at Mendoza?,west_wing
1660,bartlet,"Yeah, you’re right. I’ll see you later.",west_wing
1661,bartlet,"Good morning, gentlemen. Sorry to keep you waiting. Let’s go.",west_wing
1662,bartlet,Good morning. Good morning. Hang on a second.,west_wing
1663,bartlet,Good morning. Keep your seats.,west_wing
1664,bartlet,Do this for me. Put together some information on Roberto Mendoza.,west_wing
1666,bartlet,No. I just want to be able to know something. There’s gonna be a lot of questions.  I don’t want it to be “we had a Hispanic on the short list.”,west_wing
1668,bartlet,The reason we didn’t go with him.,west_wing
1670,bartlet,Let’s do better than that.,west_wing
1671,bartlet,"Uh, what’s going on with this drug thing?",west_wing
1673,bartlet,All right. I’ll trust ya. Thank you.,west_wing
1705,bartlet,"Here’s an interesting statement.  “I join Judge Black, insomuch as while enjoying  my privacy, I am compelled to admit that government has a right to invade it unless  specifically prohibited by some specific Constitutional provision.” Unquote.",west_wing
1706,bartlet,Why isn’t this ever been brought up?,west_wing
1707,bartlet,"We spent two months vetting our homerun nominee, he doesn’t believe in a privacy guarantee,  and it never came up?",west_wing
1711,bartlet, When does Harrison get in?,west_wing
1712,bartlet,I want him first thing in the morning.,west_wing
1713,bartlet,"When was the last time either of you slept, I don’t care. Get ready for this.",west_wing
1714,bartlet,I want to meet Mendoza.,west_wing
1718,bartlet,"Judge Harrison, first thing’s first, are you the author of this unsigned note?",west_wing
1719,bartlet,"When I was 26, I wrote a paper supporting the deregulation of Far East trade barriers.  Nearly got thrown out of the London School of Economics. I was young and stupid, and  trying to make some noise.",west_wing
1720,bartlet,I’m gonna bring Toby Ziegler and Sam Seaborn in here and talk about this a little bit.,west_wing
1738,bartlet,"Peyton, do I have the right to put on an ugly plaid jacket and a loud polka-dot tie and  walk down Main Street?",west_wing
1739,bartlet,Where in the Constitution is that right guaranteed?,west_wing
1740,bartlet,"What about the use of cream in my coffee? Surely, there can be no free speech argument  to be made there?",west_wing
1741,bartlet,So you have no objection to the state of New Hampshire passing a law banning use of cream  in coffee?,west_wing
1742,bartlet,As I lose the votes of coffee drinkers everywhere.,west_wing
1746,bartlet,"This Sam is young, drives me nuts too, but he took you off for a ride, sir, because that’s  what I told him to do.",west_wing
1747,bartlet,"I understand, Peyton. Could you give us a little time, please? We’ll make you comfortable  while you’re waiting.",west_wing
1749,bartlet,You don’t think the guy who called Sam wouldn’t know how to call a senator’s office?,west_wing
1757,bartlet,"I’m sure we’re almost done. Sam, what else you got?",west_wing
1758,bartlet,Did you have a drink yesterday?,west_wing
1759,bartlet,Are you gonna have one today?,west_wing
1760,bartlet,That’s all you ever have to say to me.,west_wing
1761,bartlet,"You fought in a war, got me elected, and you run the country. I think we all owe you  one, don’t you?",west_wing
1762,bartlet,Did Harrison get off okay?,west_wing
1763,bartlet,"I’ll bet it has.  Do you have any more questions, Sam?",west_wing
1765,bartlet,"Judge Mendoza, would it surprise you to learn that for the past few months, your name  has been in the short list of candidates for the bench?",west_wing
1766,bartlet,"Well, then this is gonna knock your socks off. Tomorrow evening at 5 o’clock, I am  naming you as my nominee to be the next associate justice of the United States Supreme  Court. You were not the first choice, but you are the last one, and the right one.   Will you accept the nomination?",west_wing
1767,bartlet,Thank you. Sam and Toby will be in charge of your confirmation.,west_wing
1769,bartlet,"What do you say, Leo? You up for a good fight?",west_wing
1770,bartlet,Good. Let the good fight begin.,west_wing
1819,bartlet,Oh that sounded pretty weak to me. Let’s try it again. ,west_wing
1820,bartlet,That’s better. Now who are all these people making a ruckus and tracking up my floor?   You! What’s your name?,west_wing
1821,bartlet,"And when are you gonna get taller, huh? What are you, fifteen, sixteen years old?",west_wing
1822,bartlet,"Well, all right then, you’re fine. All right, lets go. Come on, I’m a busy man. I am,  after all, the President of Bulgaria.",west_wing
1823,bartlet,"Now, wait a second. That’s not right. I’m not the President of Bulgaria. I am the  President of the Great Kingdom of Luxembourg.",west_wing
1824,bartlet,"Now hold on, I know I’m the President of something... ",west_wing
1825,bartlet,"Yes! Thank you. I am the President of the United States of America. Now, who has a question?",west_wing
1826,bartlet,My favorite part about being President?,west_wing
1827,bartlet,I’m doing it right now.  Who’s next? All right. ,west_wing
1828,bartlet, Wait. Hang on a second.,west_wing
1829,bartlet,"Okay.  Apparently, there’s a group of kids in the other room that I might  like better.",west_wing
1830,bartlet,Okay. Send some flowers. Then I’ll call his parents. ,west_wing
1831,bartlet,"Okay.  All right, now on with the questions. Now wait a minute, when you address me, please  bear in mind that you are speaking to His Royal Majesty, The King of all England.",west_wing
1852,bartlet,"Josh, what are you doing right now?",west_wing
1854,bartlet,"Seriously, take an hour and come with us.",west_wing
1856,bartlet,Oh I sneak out every now and then.,west_wing
1857,bartlet,"Yes, couple of agents, an unmarked black suburban. They tell the manager, they clear  the store, I’m in, I’m out. It’s like nothing ever happened.",west_wing
1858,bartlet,Did you know that there’s an underground tunnel out of here?,west_wing
1859,bartlet,I haven’t been able to find it even though I search almost everyday.,west_wing
1860,bartlet,"To a place called Rare Books, you know what they sell?",west_wing
1861,bartlet,Tell her to leave me alone. Sheila!,west_wing
1862,bartlet,This is a Christmas thing I’m doing Mandy; we don’t have to make hay out of it.,west_wing
1864,bartlet,"It’s Christmas, Josh! No reason we can’t do both. ",west_wing
1874,bartlet,"Oooh! “The Fables of Phaedrus,” 1886, first edition, red leather label, gilt lettering,  engraved frontice. Phaedrus, you know, who was a slave, but later granted his freedom  by Augustus, wrote his animal fables in iambic verse.",west_wing
1876,bartlet,"So, you won’t change your mind?",west_wing
1877,bartlet,So you’re gonna sit around in your hotel room by yourself?,west_wing
1878,bartlet,"Oh! So you’re gonna work on Christmas? Good, that makes me feel better.",west_wing
1879,bartlet,"Come to Manchester, stay at the house.",west_wing
1880,bartlet,"I wasn’t planning on doing that, but now that you suggest it.",west_wing
1881,bartlet,I’m not worried about it Leo.,west_wing
1882,bartlet,"It’ll be fine, these things can go away by themselves.",west_wing
1883,bartlet,I don’t want to talk about an exit strategy.,west_wing
1884,bartlet,I really don’t. It’s gonna be fine.,west_wing
1885,bartlet,"All right. You know Zoey is starting Georgetown in two weeks, I was thinking about  getting this for her. “The Nature of Things. A Viviscalic Poem Translated from the  Latin of Titus Lucrecius Carus.”",west_wing
1886,bartlet,Yeah. Because it’s got brown Moroccan spine labels.,west_wing
1887,bartlet,"All right, thanks.  Thank you all, Merry Christmas! ",west_wing
1888,bartlet,"“Life of Epicurus”, two volumes.",west_wing
1943,bartlet,Hello everybody. Welcome to The White House.  Joey. Welcome to the White House.,west_wing
1945,bartlet,"Merry Christmas, Nancy. ",west_wing
1947,bartlet,Apparently I’ve arranged for an honor guard for somebody.,west_wing
1949,bartlet,"No, no, just tell me, is there anything else I’ve arranged for? We’re still in NATO, right?",west_wing
1951,bartlet,"Toby, you’re not responsible... ",west_wing
1953,bartlet,"Toby, if we start pulling strings like this, you don’t think every homeless veteran  would come out of the woodworks? ",west_wing
1967,bartlet,Keep your seats.  Admiral Fitzwallace?,west_wing
1968,bartlet,Is it clear what India’s objective is?,west_wing
1969,bartlet,"When you say “the Indian army,” what are we talking about?",west_wing
1970,bartlet,Five guys in a Humvee? What?,west_wing
1971,bartlet, In the last twenty-five minutes?,west_wing
1972,bartlet,"300,000 is an awfully large piece of troop movement to have been on a whim.",west_wing
1973,bartlet,All I’m trying to do right now? I’m trying to avoid making eye contact with the CIA Director.,west_wing
1974,bartlet,"300,000 troops? I can’t move my motorcade from K Street to Connecticut without it showing  up on a weather satellite.",west_wing
1975,bartlet,"Pick it up again, would you please?",west_wing
1976,bartlet,Any chance this is an exercise?,west_wing
1977,bartlet,"Oh, I wouldn’t worry about that, that’s probably not important information.",west_wing
1978,bartlet,"All right. I’m ordering the Crisis Task Force activated, and I want you to prepare to  give me a national security briefing. Thank you.",west_wing
1984,bartlet,"I’ve already had words. TOBY, the U.N. Security Council is meeting in an emergency  session to try to affect a cease-fire.",west_wing
1987,bartlet,"They didn’t exactly miss them. In fact, they’ve got a very good photo now.",west_wing
1990,bartlet,"Toby, how much do you know about India and Pakistan?",west_wing
2008,bartlet,"Well, we’ve got ourselves a ballgame.",west_wing
2045,bartlet,"Well, bring in Dr. Strangelove and we’re all set.",west_wing
2046,bartlet,There’s an India expert I want to bring in.,west_wing
2047,bartlet,You guys are gonna love him.,west_wing
2048,bartlet,"Lord John Marbury, former ambassador to New Delhi from the Court of Saint James.",west_wing
2049,bartlet,We can hide the women. But the man deserves a drink.,west_wing
2050,bartlet,Let’s get him on a plane.,west_wing
2078,bartlet,This ought to be delightful.,west_wing
2079,bartlet,"Thanks for staying late, Charlie.",west_wing
2080,bartlet,My daughter asked you out?,west_wing
2081,bartlet,I should have locked her in the dungeon.,west_wing
2082,bartlet,I could have built one.,west_wing
2083,bartlet,"Charlie, you have picked the absolute worst time in the world to talk to me about this.",west_wing
2084,bartlet,Yes.  He wants to go out with Zoey.,west_wing
2085,bartlet,"Thank you for seeing us so late, and on such short notice.",west_wing
2086,bartlet,"Mr. Ambassador, it is crucial that we join together to bring about a cease-fire and  then a pullback, in Kashmir, before this conflict takes another escalating step.",west_wing
2087,bartlet,"Well, this just keeps getting better and better.",west_wing
2092,bartlet,"Please, sit down. We’ve been trying to phone your Prime Minister without any luck.  Can you help us out there?",west_wing
2093,bartlet,"Mr. Ambassador, I stood at a podium this morning, and I publicly condemned the incursion  by Indian forces.",west_wing
2094,bartlet,My condemnation might have been stronger if my State Department didn’t feel that the  Indian action was provoked.,west_wing
2095,bartlet,You deny there has been Pakistani movement in the Neutral Zone?,west_wing
2096,bartlet,Hang on. Look. The U.S. is committed to finding a reasonable solution to the dispute.,west_wing
2097,bartlet,"Whatever the language, I know that you will agree with me that we have to find a way  for these two countries to exist together in a global community.",west_wing
2098,bartlet,I’d imagine the Indian ambassador is going to say roughly the same thing about you.,west_wing
2099,bartlet,Yes.  Thank you for coming.,west_wing
2100,bartlet,I’ll take the Indian ambassador in the Oval Office.,west_wing
2101,bartlet,"And then if you could just ask the Secret Service to step in and kill me, please.",west_wing
2102,bartlet,Zoey just walked right up to him and asked him out.,west_wing
2103,bartlet,"See, but a dungeon would have put an end to that.",west_wing
2104,bartlet,I think you’re trying to cover up the fact that you’re enjoying this.,west_wing
2105,bartlet,I don’t have a racial problem.,west_wing
2106,bartlet,I’m Spencer Tracy at the end of “Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner.”,west_wing
2107,bartlet,"My problem is not that she’s white, he’s black, it’s that she’s a girl and he’s not.  To say nothing of he’s older than she is.",west_wing
2108,bartlet,"Yeah, but a guy learns a lot in those two years.",west_wing
2109,bartlet,Tracy was good in that movie.,west_wing
2110,bartlet,"I was looking a lot better before your country breached about fourteen cease-fire  conditions without so much as a phone call, so let’s sit down and talk. Charlie,  please close the door.",west_wing
2116,bartlet,"My frustration, Mr. Ambassador, is that both you and the Pakistanis have nuclear weapons  and a tendency to get cranky.",west_wing
2117,bartlet,"Well, it was nice spending this time with you.",west_wing
2118,bartlet,"Every time he talks about colonial Western imperialism, I always want to remind him  that the United States is also a revolutionary country that threw off its colonial masters.",west_wing
2119,bartlet,Thank you for coming. How was your flight?,west_wing
2120,bartlet,"We need your take on the situation, John.",west_wing
2121,bartlet,The world is coming apart at the seams.,west_wing
2133,bartlet,I want to ask him to stay a little bit and help us out.,west_wing
2134,bartlet,You two are going to become good friends.,west_wing
2135,bartlet,"For the first couple of weeks, so did I.",west_wing
2139,bartlet,Is he still on the phone?,west_wing
2140,bartlet, There’s a quote from Revelations I’m trying to remember.,west_wing
2141,bartlet,"Say, listen. My hesitation about your going out with Zoey before, you know, it’s not  ‘cause you’re black.",west_wing
2142,bartlet,"Still, I want you to go out with her if that’s what you both want to do.",west_wing
2143,bartlet,"Just remember these two things: She’s nineteen years old, and the 82nd Airborne works for me.",west_wing
2144,bartlet,"Also this - no kidding. You go out with Zoey, you’re gonna get your picture taken.  There’s gonna be a lot of people not wild about the sight of you and the President’s  daughter. You know what to do with the mail, right?",west_wing
2145,bartlet, All right. You keep your head up.,west_wing
2146,bartlet,Should have built a dungeon.,west_wing
2147,bartlet," Revelations. It’s about a horse,  and Death was riding on it maybe.",west_wing
2148,bartlet,"Ah, good, I want you all to meet John.",west_wing
2149,bartlet,Don’t you ever forget the battles you’ve fought and won.,west_wing
2150,bartlet,That’s what I’d heard. But all they got was two weeks.,west_wing
2151,bartlet,"John, I was hoping you’d stick around for a couple of days and help us out.",west_wing
2152,bartlet,"John, there’s a quote from Revelations...",west_wing
2153,bartlet,"Are you frightened, John?",west_wing
2154,bartlet,"With nearly 18 million new jobs, wages rising at more than twice the rate of inflation,  the highest home ownership in history, the smallest welfare rolls in 30 years and the  lowest peacetime unemployment since 1957.  I stand before you to report that  America has created the longest peacetime economic expansion in our history. For the  first time in three decades, the budget is balanced. From a deficit of 290 million  dollars just ten years ago...",west_wing
2156,bartlet," From a deficit of 290 billion dollars, just ten... it says “million”  on the TelePrompTer, by the way.",west_wing
2164,bartlet,"...And how do we make the American dream of opportunity a reality for all? I came to  this hallowed chamber one year ago, and I see we’re spelling “hallowed” with a pound  sign in the middle of it.",west_wing
2165,bartlet,The pound sign’s silent?,west_wing
2166,bartlet,"I came to this hallowed chamber one year ago on a mission: to restore the American  dream for all our people, as we gaze at the vast horizon of possibilities open to us  in the 321st century... Wow, that was ambitious of me, wasn’t it?",west_wing
2167,bartlet,"We meant “stronger” here, right?",west_wing
2168,bartlet,I’m proud to report our country’s stranger than it was a year ago?,west_wing
2169,bartlet,Why is everyone asking me that today?,west_wing
2173,bartlet,"I’m taking many things, C.J.",west_wing
2174,bartlet,I don’t know. My wife hands me pills. I swallow them with water.,west_wing
2175,bartlet,Vitamin C. Vitamin B. Is it possible I’m taking something called 'euthanasia'?,west_wing
2176,bartlet,"Ah, that sounds more like it... Toby?",west_wing
2178,bartlet," You know, carrying them around in my pocket was a pretty big step for me.",west_wing
2180,bartlet,“How do we make the American dream a reality for all who work for it.” ,west_wing
2181,bartlet,"You got to add, “who work for it.”",west_wing
2190,bartlet,"It’s what they’re listening for in welfare reforms, so screw it.",west_wing
2192,bartlet,"Damn, Toby, ‘cause you’re exactly who I was gonna come running to.",west_wing
2194,bartlet,"Well, I’m gazing in the 321st century, man. There’s a lot on my mind.",west_wing
2195,bartlet,"Oh, dear God. I will take the pills, C.J.",west_wing
2197,bartlet,"Yes. I will go to the Oval Office, and pour a glass of water from the Steuben glass  pitcher, which was a gift from the Christian Charity Network there, Skippy.",west_wing
2198,bartlet,"I’m just saying, before you start calling me, Ebenezer Bartlet, remember, I got a  really nice glass pitcher for just, you know, being a good guy.",west_wing
2200,bartlet, I will take the pills.,west_wing
2203,bartlet,I don’t need a cardiogram.,west_wing
2204,bartlet,"I didn’t have a heart attack, Leo. I got the flu, and I don’t need a cardiogram.",west_wing
2205,bartlet,"Thank you, Mrs. Landingham... Mrs. Landingham how do I look to you?",west_wing
2207,bartlet,101.9 and I still got it.,west_wing
2208,bartlet,Anybody know if the Celtics won tonight?,west_wing
2209,bartlet,It was a two-week cease-fire. There’s four days left.,west_wing
2210,bartlet,What’s Intel saying about the Pakistanis?,west_wing
2211,bartlet,I’m going to bed. But somebody call me if there’s movement.,west_wing
2220,bartlet," It tested very well. I’m not saying we’re doing it, Toby. I just want to  try it and see how it reads. The era of big government is over... All right. Thanks.",west_wing
2221,bartlet,I’m feeling roughly the same as I was feeling when you asked me four minutes ago.,west_wing
2222,bartlet,"It’s okay. This isn’t the worst of it, Charlie. The worst of it’s coming up the stairs  right now.",west_wing
2223,bartlet,I was wondering when you were gonna notice me.,west_wing
2224,bartlet,You’re very sexy when you’re in doctor mode you know that? Give me an IV/saline  solution and 100 milligrams of Flumadine. Stat.  I could jump you right now.,west_wing
2225,bartlet,Fitzwallace called me in the Situation Room. There was more movement in Kashmir.,west_wing
2226,bartlet,I broke the Steuben glass pitcher in the Oval Office.,west_wing
2227,bartlet,"Seriously, Abbey, I’m fine.",west_wing
2228,bartlet,I really don’t remember.,west_wing

2230,bartlet,I’m really sorry about the pitcher.,west_wing
2231,bartlet,I could jump you right now.,west_wing
2244,bartlet,Can I go to the office?,west_wing
2245,bartlet,Here’s the thing though. I never really saw you study while you were in med school.,west_wing
2246,bartlet,Do you even know what you’re listening for right now? ,west_wing
2247,bartlet,I’m going to the office.,west_wing
2248,bartlet,Alright. I think I’ll stay here for a little bit.,west_wing
2262,bartlet,I don’t understand. Don’t any of these characters have jobs?,west_wing
2263,bartlet,They seem to have a lot of free time in the middle of the day.,west_wing
2264,bartlet,And that woman’s changed her clothes for quite a lot in one afternoon.,west_wing
2265,bartlet,"Yeah. Would you mind stepping out, Charlie?",west_wing
2266,bartlet,"Abbey phoned me up and told me about your conversation. I was diagnosed about seven years  ago. My life expectancy is normal. My particular course of MS is relapsing-remitting,  which means I should experience total recovery after attacks. Abbey gives me injections  of something called Betaseron, and that reduces the frequency. Fever and stress tend to  be two things that induces attacks.",west_wing
2267,bartlet,You haven’t called me “Jed” since I was elected.,west_wing
2268,bartlet,‘Cause I wanted to be the President.,west_wing

2277,bartlet,And a strong shot of whiskey?,west_wing
2278,bartlet,"What have you got for me, John?",west_wing
2279,bartlet,"Your friend, the prime minister?",west_wing
2280,bartlet,He’s gonna go for this?,west_wing
2281,bartlet,"All right, you tell the ambassador we’ll discuss this in three months. In three months,  John. I don’t want this to be like quid pro quo.",west_wing
2282,bartlet,"That’s the carrot. Leo, what’s the stick?",west_wing
2283,bartlet,"They put command-control in the field, John, and we’re gonna get physical. You make damn  sure they know that.",west_wing
2284,bartlet,Talk to the ambassador. I want Fitzwallace to have photos in 24 hours.,west_wing
2286,bartlet,Much better. Thank you.,west_wing
2287,bartlet,"You know, I was watching a television program before with a sort of a roving moderator  who spoke to a seated panel of young women who are having some sort of problems with  their boyfriends. Apparently, because the boyfriends have all slept with the girlfriend’s  mothers. Then they brought all the boyfriends out and they fought right there on television.  Toby, tell me, these people don’t vote, do they?",west_wing
2290,bartlet,"What do you need, Josh?",west_wing
2293,bartlet,You want to cut the line?,west_wing
2295,bartlet,"I think so, too.  What do you think, Josh?",west_wing
2297,bartlet,Then you and Sam get your people together and get to work.,west_wing
2304,bartlet,You’ve taken it 14 times in the last three hours. You’re not taking it again.,west_wing
2305,bartlet,At least not with a thermometer.,west_wing
2306,bartlet,I’m saying if you want to take it recreationally...,west_wing
2307,bartlet,I stopped asking those questions.,west_wing
2315,bartlet,"Godspeed, your Lordship.",west_wing
2316,bartlet,"Friends, let me have your attention please. A lot of time, energy, passion, wit, skill,  and talent went into drafting this, and while you might not know it from my delivery  later, this is an extraordinary speech. And I say thee yea! Toby Ziegler, and I say  thee yea! Sam Seaborn!",west_wing
2317,bartlet,"Roger, I’m sorry you drew the short straw on this. We’ll miss you tonight. Next year,  it’ll be the surgeon general, I promise. Meanwhile, you can watch TV at my study.",west_wing

2320,bartlet,"First thing always is national security. Get your commanders together. Appoint joint  chiefs. Appoint chairman. Take them to Defcon 4. Have the governor send emergency  delegates to Washington. The assistant attorney general is gonna be the acting A.G.

2321,bartlet,You have a best friend?,west_wing
2322,bartlet,Is he smarter than you?,west_wing
2323,bartlet,Would you trust him with your life?,west_wing
2324,bartlet,That’s your chief of staff.,west_wing

2413,bartlet,I'm in trouble with Chiquita and Dole? ,west_wing
2414,bartlet,"We have appointed five people to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. Republicans  in the House, as well as an alarming number of Democrats, have been holding up those  appointments. ",west_wing
2416,bartlet,"As far as I can tell, their reluctance has little, if anything, to do with bananas. ",west_wing
2422,bartlet,You're going to sit with them? ,west_wing
2424,bartlet,And talk to the father. ,west_wing
2425,bartlet,"The mother too, but I'm concerned about the father. ",west_wing
2428,bartlet,This is no time to out a guy in front and center who's embarrassed that his son was gay. ,west_wing

2435,bartlet, What time are you going up to the Hill? ,west_wing
2436,bartlet,"I want to pre-empt a hearing. I don't want it. I don't want it for Leo. I don't want  it for his family. I don't want it for us. They know that, and they're gonna play ""Let's  Make a Deal."" Don't take anything off the table until you've talked to me. You understand? ",west_wing
2437,bartlet,"Okay. Unless a war breaks out, I'll be spending much of my day talking about bananas. ",west_wing
2439,bartlet,Alright.  Is Simon Blye coming in to meet with  you today? ,west_wing
2440,bartlet,I broke into your secret schedule compartment and took infrared photos with my compact  camera.  ,west_wing
2441,bartlet,"Margaret told me. Look, why are you meeting with that man? ",west_wing
2442,bartlet,"In good times, Leo. It's not hard to like a guy when he's doing well. The measure of a  man is, how does he behave when things are otherwise? ",west_wing
2443,bartlet,"That you couldn't get from me? Or Toby, or Josh, or Sam, or C.J.? ",west_wing
2444,bartlet,"You put a lot of faith in people, Leo, and I love you for that. I just don't want to  see you get disappointed. ",west_wing

2485,bartlet,"Thank you, Mrs. Landingham. ",west_wing
2486,bartlet,She withholds food from me. ,west_wing
2488,bartlet,We're gonna leave it alone for a while. ,west_wing
2489,bartlet, After the midterm elections. ,west_wing
2492,bartlet,It's a pretty incendiary report. ,west_wing
2494,bartlet," It's not gonna play well at a PTA meeting, C.J.  It says we should be teaching kids to have sex. ",west_wing
2496,bartlet,Of course it doesn't. But that's how it's going to play. ,west_wing
2499,bartlet,"C.J., getting it through this congress, a body which at the moment, will only give federal  funding to sex education programs that teach abstinence only. ",west_wing

2503,bartlet,"I needed to get Leo off the hook, C.J. ",west_wing
2505,bartlet,Yes. We'll deal with it after the midterm elections. ,west_wing
2506,bartlet, I was hoping you would. ,west_wing
2508,bartlet,"Yeah. Well there's nothing wrong with telling them we got it. I wouldn't make a big deal  out of it. We got it, we're looking at it, we're studying it. Throw it out with the trash. ",west_wing
2545,bartlet,I was helping pass the time. I was being entertaining as well as instructive.,west_wing
2547,bartlet,Leo! What’re you doing here?,west_wing
2549,bartlet,Aww. You don’t know how to have fun when we’re traveling...,west_wing
2585,bartlet,We got to get Mendoza on the bench.,west_wing
2586,bartlet,Why is it my problem at all?,west_wing
2587,bartlet,The governor of Michigan.,west_wing

2596,bartlet,What happened to the guy who shot your mother?,west_wing
2597,bartlet,"If they did, would you wanna see him executed? ",west_wing
2598,bartlet,Killing a police officer’s a capital crime. I figured you must have thought about it.,west_wing
2611,bartlet,I was just wandering the halls and thinking.,west_wing
2613,bartlet, You ever seen the White House?,west_wing
2616,bartlet,Is that short for Joanne?,west_wing
2617,bartlet,And your last name is Lucas?,west_wing
2618,bartlet,"Well, this is the Oval Office. Come in, please. Sit down. ",west_wing
2619,bartlet,"Well, where did you go to school?",west_wing
2620,bartlet,There’s a guy named Simon Cruz on death row. He’s going to be executed in about 36  hours. What do you think I should do? ,west_wing
2621,bartlet,He was found guilty of a double murder and drug trafficking.,west_wing
2622,bartlet,You’re against capital punishment.,west_wing
2623,bartlet,Did you study St. Augustine at Stanford?,west_wing
2624,bartlet,"Two pretty smart guys, right?",west_wing
2625,bartlet,"They believed in that part of the Old Testament which said, “Who sheddeth a man’s  blood by man shall his blood be shed.”",west_wing

2653,bartlet,Fine. What do you need?,west_wing
2655,bartlet,Jewish law doesn’t prohibit...,west_wing
2656,bartlet,"The commandment does not say, “Thou shalt not kill.” It says, “Thou shalt not murder.”",west_wing

2662,bartlet,And the next President sees it in a different way. I’ve laid track to all kinds of...  The next guy is gonna have eighth amendment problems up the ass.,west_wing
2663,bartlet,We cannot execute some people and not execute others depending on the mood of the Oval  Office. It’s cruel and unusual. ,west_wing

2674,bartlet,Thanks for coming all this way down.,west_wing
2675,bartlet,"Yeah, it seems like a wasted trip.",west_wing

2677,bartlet,We don’t use the red phone anymore.,west_wing
2678,bartlet,I tell Mrs. Landingham I want to talk to the Kremlin. Would you like a drink?,west_wing
2679,bartlet,"To be honest, I prefer Mr. President.",west_wing
2680,bartlet,"You understand why, right?",west_wing
2681,bartlet,There are certain decisions I have to make while I’m in this room. Do I send troops  into harm’s way? Which fatal disease gets the most research money?,west_wing
2682,bartlet,It’s helpful in those situations not to think of yourself as the man but as the office.,west_wing
2683,bartlet,I want you to know that I had a number of people on my staff search for a reason the  public would find palatable to commute the sentence. A technicality. Any evidence of  racism.,west_wing
2684,bartlet,"I’m the leader of a democracy, Tom. Seventy-one percent of the people support capital  punishment. People have spoken. The courts have spoken.",west_wing
2685,bartlet," Oh, for crying out loud, Tom. I open my mouth and say, “Somebody get me the Pope.”",west_wing
2686,bartlet,"Anyway. I looked for a way out, I really did.",west_wing
2687,bartlet,"I did, Tom. I know it’s hard to believe, but I prayed for wisdom.",west_wing
2688,bartlet, It never has. And I’m a little pissed off about that. ,west_wing
2689,bartlet,"Bless me, Father, for I have sinned...",west_wing
2740,bartlet," “When reporters confronted Secretary O’Leary in a hallway outside the hearing  room, she defended...” Oh come on!",west_wing
2742,bartlet,Yeah.  “If the shoe fits.” Is that the best she could do? ,west_wing
2744,bartlet,"Let me say that I have great confidence in Deborah O’Leary. She’s done a terrific job  at HUD, helping thousands of people make the very difficult transition from joblessness  and homelessness to more fulfilling and productive lives.",west_wing
2745,bartlet,"I was hoping you weren’t going to notice that, Danny.",west_wing
2746,bartlet,"Then I will tell you that I agree the Republican Party does not have a comprehensive  program for combating poverty in this country. That being said, there are countless  Republicans who are working very hard to change their party’s legacy on some of these  issues. And I hope to be working with them to do just that.",west_wing
2748,bartlet,"Frankly, I think she went too far in assigning motive to Congressman Wooden and the  Republican Party.",west_wing
2749,bartlet,She’ll be meeting with Leo McGarry.,west_wing
2750,bartlet,An apology’d be appropriate.,west_wing
2751,bartlet, That went pretty well.,west_wing
2849,bartlet,What could you possibly want right now?,west_wing
2850,bartlet,"I mean, what in the name of everything holy could you want right now?",west_wing
2851,bartlet,And what could you possibly want?,west_wing

2862,bartlet,Why am I gonna be reading that I do?,west_wing
2864,bartlet,You told the press I have a secret plan to fight inflation?,west_wing
2866,bartlet,"Josh, I’m a little confused.",west_wing
2868,bartlet,"Okay, before we go on. C.J., if blood is gushing from the head wound you just received  from a stampeding herd of bison, you’ll do the press briefing.",west_wing
2869,bartlet,A secret plan to fight inflation?,west_wing
2872,bartlet,"Are you telling me that not only did you invent a secret plan to fight inflation, but  now you don’t support it?",west_wing
2876,bartlet,You said you were gonna fix it.,west_wing
2877,bartlet,"It’s broken again, Leo.",west_wing
2879,bartlet,"We will have the first of what I think will a series of discussions about professionalism  another time, Toby. Where is Mendoza?",west_wing
2880,bartlet,Is he coming in from Neptune?,west_wing
2881,bartlet,"Okay. We will wait for Mendoza. In the meantime, C.J., you will untangle the Press Corps.",west_wing
2882,bartlet,And we will hope that nothing happens today to make this any worse. Although I certainly  wouldn’t bet the house on it. That is all.,west_wing
2898,bartlet,I don't like putting him in this position.,west_wing
2899,bartlet,I just don't want you to think that I'm getting any pleasure in putting him in this  position.,west_wing
2900,bartlet,I mean it's ironic that it all comes down to a vote on the ethanol tax credit.,west_wing
2901,bartlet,Are you being brusque with me?,west_wing
2902,bartlet,I'm just saying you can't blame me. It's what you get from having an even number  of senators.,west_wing
2903,bartlet,That's what I usually do.,west_wing
2904,bartlet," Ron, am I going to meet her on the plane?",west_wing
2905,bartlet, Zoey got a new agent on her detail.,west_wing
2906,bartlet,Have you seen these new agents?,west_wing
2907,bartlet,"They've got the hair, the backpacks, the clothes. Walking around campus strapped to a  44 magnum.",west_wing
2908,bartlet,"Let me tell you something, when it's your kid, you don't want them blending in. You  want them wearing a sign that says, ""I'm carrying a loaded gun, and the safety's off.""",west_wing

2919,bartlet,"Make all the calls you want, it's going to be 50-50.",west_wing
2921,bartlet,You two are so freaked out about this Al Kiefer meeting.,west_wing

2923,bartlet,"You two want to see the best part about having my job?   Colonel, this is the president. I'm ready to go.",west_wing
2935,bartlet," I'm sorry we haven't had a chance to meet before now. You've been with  Zoey's detail, what?",west_wing
2936,bartlet,You were a Mountaineer.,west_wing
2937,bartlet,"So, you were commissioned a second lieutenant?",west_wing
2938,bartlet,How long have you trained for this assignment?,west_wing
2939,bartlet,"What, were you the first one to sign up?",west_wing
2940,bartlet,"You know Zoey's dating my body man, Charlie Young, right?",west_wing
2941,bartlet,You know about the letters?,west_wing
2942,bartlet,Are they white supremacists?,west_wing
2943,bartlet,"You don't have an artist's sketch, or psychological profiles, or anything?",west_wing
2944,bartlet,"Okay. Zoey's 19 and she wants to be a teenager. She wants a college experience, and  I can't blame her. I loved college. So did my other daughters. I want Zoey to be  comfortable with her protection, I don't want her to try and give you the slip. It's  not your job to tell me she wants to cut English Lit, it's not your job to tell me if  she's dying her hair blue, or going to a strip club, or whatever it is she's doing  with her friends. You know what your job is.",west_wing
2945,bartlet,"If she's cutting English Lit, I want to know about it.",west_wing
2986,bartlet,"I'm sorry. I've actually been told that I have to go now. This is a debate that is  obviously going to continue in town halls, city halls, state legislatures, and the U.S.  House of Representatives. There is a population in this country that seems to focus so  much time and energy into this conversation, so much so that I am forced to ask this  question -- is there an epidemic of flag burning going on that I'm not aware of? ",west_wing
2987,bartlet,"I mean it, man, is there an emergency-level outbreak of flag desecration no one's kept  me posted on? ",west_wing
2989,bartlet,"Toby, there is no reason for you to feel threatened by Al Kiefer. ",west_wing
2990,bartlet,Excellent. Because we're doing it over lunch. ,west_wing
2992,bartlet,"Better, yet, Charlie, where is Zoey having lunch? ",west_wing
2993,bartlet,"That supposed to be a good place, Sam? ",west_wing
2994,bartlet,Is that an L.A. experience? ,west_wing
2995,bartlet,"Well, there aren't going to be any people today. ",west_wing
2996,bartlet,"Sounds like fun, doesn't it? ",west_wing
2997,bartlet,"Yeah, but the hotel wouldn't make the guacamole right in front of me. ",west_wing
2999,bartlet,We can do it in the car. Who's talking to Leo? ,west_wing
3000,bartlet,"You come in the car, too. ",west_wing
3002,bartlet, Those people over there don't like me too much. ,west_wing
3004,bartlet,"You would honestly think there was an epidemic of flag burning going on, endangering  countless lives in this country. ",west_wing
3006,bartlet,"I'm having lunch with my daughter, Toby. You guys are going to sit with Kiefer, and  let me know what's worth listening to. ",west_wing
3008,bartlet,"No, and you know why? Because you made fun of the guacamole. ",west_wing
3009,bartlet,I could tell you were thinking it. ,west_wing
3010,bartlet,"Surprised you for lunch, I know, I'm the best. ",west_wing
3011,bartlet,"Yeah, but on the other hand, the guy made guacamole right in front of us. ",west_wing
3012,bartlet,This is father/daughter fun time. ,west_wing
3013,bartlet,"Oh, you know, I hadn't thought about that.  Now that you mention it, yeah,  I think you're right. ",west_wing
3014,bartlet,"All kinds of things in California, Zoey. You've got your smog, your freeway shootings,  brush fires, mudslides. Plus, apparently, there's a mad rash of flag burning going on,  and you don't want a piece of that. ",west_wing
3015,bartlet,"Right there, right in front of me, they made the guacamole. Now, how about that? ",west_wing
3018,bartlet,"C.J., has Al said something that I should listen to, yet? ",west_wing
3022,bartlet,"Yeah, but I never get tired of hearing them, you know. Especially in front of my  daughter. ",west_wing
3025,bartlet,Men with pools and patios think I'm weak. ,west_wing
3027,bartlet,Was that Marcus on the phone? ,west_wing
3029,bartlet,No way I can get out of it? ,west_wing
3030,bartlet,"I used to like parties, you know that? ",west_wing
3049,bartlet,"We're running out of reasons not to fire him, Leo. ",west_wing
3050,bartlet,"I can ask for his resignation, and don't be a smart ass. ",west_wing
3051,bartlet,"All right, let's do what Sam said. ",west_wing
3052,bartlet,"I'm not done with Hoynes, but dump it. ",west_wing
3053,bartlet,"I'll call him from the plane.  Christ, will this damn day never end? ",west_wing
3074,bartlet,"It's not going to pass, Ted. It's not going to get voted on. ",west_wing
3075,bartlet,"And I'm saying as a gesture, as a symbol, you make that public demand, Ted, and you're  going to be Cameron's best friend. ",west_wing
3076,bartlet,"Oh, God, Ted! Give me the name of one person who's complaining to you, and I'll call  them personally and tell them I will never sign a law like that. ",west_wing
3077,bartlet, Don't you ever slap  Josh Lyman around again. That guy is the White House Deputy Chief of Staff. He's not  one of your associate producers. ,west_wing
3078,bartlet,"Don't screw around with me now, Ted. I'm really not in the mood. ",west_wing
3079,bartlet,"Right now, right this second, the worst thing that could possibly happen to gay rights  in this country is for me to put that thing on the debating table, which is happens  the minute I open my mouth. Do you get that? I'm a human starting gun, Ted. You got  to trust me! I know what I'm doing. ",west_wing
3080,bartlet,"Imagine how tired I'm going to look when you see me a couple of months from now.   I haven't slept well, lately. Kept everyone up on the plane as we flew out.  You know, we left at 3 in the morning? I really want to try to sleep on the way back. ",west_wing
3095,bartlet," Anyway, Mr. Vice President, it's taken care of, we can put it to rest.",west_wing
3096,bartlet,"I want to tell you, a couple of years ago in Iowa, I really admired the way you hung  in there on the ethanol tax credit. You went out to Iowa and said the same things  you'd been saying in the Senate for eight years, event though you knew it wasn't going  to play. My confession is, you and I agree on ethanol, but you were the only one to  say it. You stood in there even though you knew you were going to lose Iowa and who  knows what after that. Anyway, I just wanted to say you had a good day today, John.",west_wing
3097,bartlet,I'm going to try to go to sleep now.,west_wing
3098,bartlet, Is here going to be a coup? ,west_wing
3099,bartlet,Is there going to be a coup? ,west_wing
3100,bartlet,And this is on page.... ,west_wing
3101,bartlet,Yeah?   Leo... Intelligence briefing. ,west_wing
3102,bartlet,There are mornings I'm just nodding my head. That can't be good for anybody. ,west_wing
3103,bartlet,I'll say. Who knows so far? ,west_wing
3104,bartlet, The market is going to open 200 points down. ,west_wing
3105,bartlet,When was the last time we were lucky? ,west_wing
3106,bartlet,It's going to be 300...350. ,west_wing
3107,bartlet,I'm not saying I'm not sure it's Ehrlich. ,west_wing
3108,bartlet,I'm saying I'm not sure. It's the Fed Chairman. Give me a day. ,west_wing
3109,bartlet,Wall Street needs to trust me. ,west_wing
3110,bartlet,A day. I'll tell you something else. You could have been nicer to me during this  conversation. ,west_wing
3111,bartlet,By saying that Wall Street does trust me and the market will hold until I appoint  a new Fed Chairman. ,west_wing
3112,bartlet,I'm not ready to jump into bed with Ron Ehrlich yet. I'm one of the few people in my  family who can say that. ,west_wing
3113,bartlet,So...  That's was page 17? ,west_wing
3163,bartlet,Without regard to the validity of past arguments. ,west_wing
3164,bartlet,Yes and I'm saying that condition doesn't exist anymore.,west_wing
3165,bartlet,"Historically, American prosperity has been built the broad growth in the GDP  of 5% of greater. And now with the deflationary pressures of the Global Economy,  that kind of growth can be achieved without the negative side affects of rampant  inflation.  Do you understand what I'm saying?",west_wing
3167,bartlet,My point is Ron Ehrlich might not be the guy. I'm saying it's not a mortal lock. ,west_wing
3172,bartlet,"C.J., we don't handle my wife. When we try, do you know what happens at the other  end of this building?  ",west_wing
3174,bartlet,I get a little punishment. Screw it. Let's move on. It's not a big deal.  ,west_wing
3175,bartlet,"Yeah, Leo says I can do that. It's gonna be Phyllis who has never liked me.  It's gonna be Susan who thinks I'm xenophobic because I don't like Mexican food.  These are my wife's friends. ",west_wing
3176,bartlet,Yes.  They're still angry at me 'cause  I accidentally ran them over with my car. ,west_wing
3177,bartlet,"Thank you, Mrs. Landingham. ",west_wing
3179,bartlet,I'll tell you what else; historically 2 to 2 ½ GDP expansion is classified  lack luster even anemic economic growth.  Four ½ to 5% is needed just to be considered robust and not even spectacular. ,west_wing
3180,bartlet,Sometimes I'm just making it up. ,west_wing
3181,bartlet,How about math. Why aren't you taking math? ,west_wing
3182,bartlet,"Wiseass all you want, but you're coming of age in the 21st century. A century  in which I promise you mathematics is going to play a starring role. On the  other hand I would definitely put my shoulder into Intro to Cinema. Intro to  Cinema's what got me where I am today. ",west_wing
3183,bartlet,That was going to be a big part of my day. ,west_wing
3184,bartlet,I met with Butterfield and some Secret Service Agents this morning. ,west_wing
3185,bartlet,You didn't do anything. They think you should be taking more math. ,west_wing
3186,bartlet,It's time for me to tell you about some letters we've been getting. ,west_wing
3187,bartlet, Yeah. They don't like that the daughter of the President is dating a young  black man. ,west_wing
3188,bartlet,"Zoey, please don't tell me you're dating more than one guy. ",west_wing
3189,bartlet,Cause one guy for you is actually one more than I'm comfortable with.,west_wing
3190,bartlet,I could see it's had a real impact on you. ,west_wing
3191,bartlet,No worse than any of the stuff they intercept. ,west_wing
3192,bartlet,Yeah. Why did Butterfield and the guys meet with me? Apparently there's National  Convention of some sort in Virginia. It was in the papers yesterday that you  and Charlie are going to some club opening this weekend. ,west_wing
3193,bartlet,"You don't have to cancel, but you can't bring Charlie. ",west_wing
3194,bartlet,You want me to tell him? ,west_wing
3195,bartlet,You gotta tell him he truth Zoey. Don't make something up. ,west_wing
3196,bartlet,You sure you don't want me to come? ,west_wing
3197,bartlet,I never really new him that well. ,west_wing
3198,bartlet,I don't know. You want the job? ,west_wing
3199,bartlet,Can't have it. Know why? ,west_wing
3256,bartlet," We note with surprise your lack of conviction, Leo. ",west_wing
3257,bartlet,"I miss our late night talks, Danny. ",west_wing
3258,bartlet," Out there in the campaign trail.... Ames, Iowa...Tulsa... Skokie,  Center City, Tallahassee, Albany...San Antonio, Jasper, Wyoming. ",west_wing
3259,bartlet,You covered the First Lady as well. ,west_wing
3260,bartlet,You literally wrote the book on my wife. ,west_wing
3261,bartlet,Once again I want to emphasize the strong personal bond we built on the campaign... ,west_wing
3262,bartlet, ...in a... proper...  gentlemanly... ,west_wing
3263,bartlet,You must save me from having this conversation with my wife. ,west_wing
3264,bartlet,Or at least make it seem like I'm better armed than I evidently am. ,west_wing
3265,bartlet,"Welcome to the club, Danny. We had some jackets made. ",west_wing
3266,bartlet," I'm not kidding...a personal  bond here, Danny.",west_wing
3267,bartlet," You're coaching my Personal Aide on how to best score with my daughter?  Yes, Danny, that does make me feel better. ",west_wing
3270,bartlet,The rhythm of the sewing machine petals? ,west_wing
3271,bartlet,"Well, your Chief of Staff is a very attractive woman. Maybe he was, you know... ",west_wing
3272,bartlet,"Abbey, I told C.J. specifically... ",west_wing
3273,bartlet,She didn't get the signal wrong. I wanted her to send someone. ,west_wing
3274,bartlet,"This wire thing is a problem for me. The kid on TV was a mistake. And the amendment,  from Becky Reeseman... ",west_wing
3275,bartlet,...will bring down a trade bill that's been worked on for years. ,west_wing
3276,bartlet,I staffed it out to C.J.. ,west_wing
3277,bartlet," Then don't play me, Abbey! Don't work me! A lot of people  around here think it was Lilly Mays, who planted you have a preference for Ron Erlich! ",west_wing
3278,bartlet, I know it wasn't Lilly Mays. It was you! ,west_wing
3279,bartlet," Well you put me in a bit of a spot there, Abigail. I name Ron Erlich now,  which I was going to do anyway, and it makes me look like I'm taking instructions  from my wife! ",west_wing
3280,bartlet,Are you talking about you or me? ,west_wing
3281,bartlet," I'll walk up to the hill right now, and I will give the Speaker of  the House my resignation. ",west_wing
3282,bartlet, Do you want to see me get on the phone and put it in session?! ,west_wing
3283,bartlet," It was nine months, Abbey. Not six months. And I waited a day on Skippy,  because the fed chair is a fairly important position, and I wanted to make damn  sure my decision was right. ",west_wing
3284,bartlet,How the hell do you know? ,west_wing
3285,bartlet,On that point I concede the high ground. ,west_wing
3286,bartlet,"No, no however. Just be wrong. Just stand there in your wrongness and be wrong, and  get used to it. ",west_wing
3287,bartlet,Okay.  We just had our first Oval Office fight. ,west_wing
3288,bartlet,Did you talk to Zoey today?  ,west_wing
3289,bartlet,"Maybe she'll be so traumatized by this experience, that she'll never date another  boy again. ",west_wing
3290,bartlet,"Don't finish that sentence, I'm a man of questionable health.   The Michigan women are waiting for me. ",west_wing
3417,bartlet,I heard. It's the first time anyone's canceled lunch on me since I took office.,west_wing
3418,bartlet,I'm not saying he didn't have a good excuse.,west_wing
3419,bartlet,Rules of Civility and Decent Behavior in Company and Conversation by George Washington.,west_wing
3420,bartlet,"The rules were drawn from an English translation of a French book of maxims. Washington  copied them down when he was 14 years old.  ""When you sit down, keep your feet  firm and even, without putting one on the other or crossing them. Put not off your  clothes in the presence of others, nor go out of your chamber half-dressed."" What a  tightassed little priss he must've been.",west_wing
3421,bartlet, Do you think I could take George Washington?,west_wing
3422,bartlet,The Minutemen were good.,west_wing
3423,bartlet," ""When in company, put not your hands on any part of your body not usually  covered.""",west_wing
3425,bartlet,"Yeah, you're right. What's going on?",west_wing
3428,bartlet,What are you talking about?,west_wing
3431,bartlet,Apparently she doesn't.,west_wing
3433,bartlet, A reporter talked to her on campus?,west_wing
3434,bartlet, Put the press in the briefing room. Tell them I'm coming  right over.,west_wing
3435,bartlet,We have been over this and we have been over this and we have been over this! They are  not supposed to talk to my daughter on campus.,west_wing
3436,bartlet,I don't give a damn if it was the Bergen County Shopper's Guide. I want to talk to the  press.,west_wing
3439,bartlet,So I just sit in my office and fume?,west_wing
3442,bartlet,I haven't heard anything about it.,west_wing
3443,bartlet,"I could take George Washington, by the way.",west_wing
3468,bartlet,Can we get this Godforsaken event over with so I can get back to presiding over a  civilization gone to hell in a handcart?,west_wing
3469,bartlet,There’s nothing wrong with my mood.,west_wing
3470,bartlet,Would you get off me with that?,west_wing
3471,bartlet,I know I’d like to beat you senseless with a head of cabbage. I know that for damn sure.,west_wing
3472,bartlet,"Charlie, does anyone have my remarks?",west_wing
3473,bartlet,Why aren’t they here right now?,west_wing
3474,bartlet,"Nothing like surrounding yourself with the best and the brightest, Charlie.",west_wing
3476,bartlet,You didn’t know it was raining?,west_wing
3478,bartlet,"A couple of things, uh, who am I gonna be talking to now?",west_wing
3479,bartlet,Give me the damn speech.,west_wing
3480,bartlet,Have I ever been trout fishing?,west_wing
3483,bartlet,Two F.E.C. commissioners resigned?,west_wing
3484,bartlet,There are two seats open in the F.E.C.?,west_wing
3485,bartlet,"Leo, two seats just opened up in the Federal Election Commission.",west_wing
3486,bartlet,"I’m saying, what if this time we say we want our guys?",west_wing
3487,bartlet,"Yeah, but we can dangle our feet in the water.",west_wing
3488,bartlet,"I’m talking about dangling our feet in the water. Josh, get Leo two candidates who back  aggressive campaign finance reform.",west_wing
3490,bartlet,"I’m not saying jump off the boat, Josh. I’m saying dangle our feet.",west_wing
3491,bartlet,"No, I’m definitely gonna be thinking about the trout fishermen, Leo, ‘cause that’s  where my focus should be.",west_wing
3492,bartlet,"I was in a better mood a year ago, Leo.",west_wing
3494,bartlet,"C.J., are you taller than you usually are?",west_wing
3496,bartlet,"Couldn’t pick a trout out of a police lineup, by the way.",west_wing
3622,bartlet,Why am I just finding out about this now?,west_wing
3623,bartlet,I really did wake up energized this morning.,west_wing
3624,bartlet,I never go to bed that way.,west_wing
3625,bartlet,"Just once, in this job, I’d like to end a day feeling as good as I did when the day  started.  Are you bothered by this?",west_wing
3626,bartlet,"We’ve heard it all before, Leo. You drive me to political safe ground. It’s not true.",west_wing
3627,bartlet, What the hell did you say?,west_wing
3628,bartlet,You want to do this now?,west_wing
3629,bartlet,"You came to my house, Leo.",west_wing
3630,bartlet,"You came to my house, and you said, “Jed, let’s run for President.” I said, “Why?”  And you said, “So that you can open your mouth and say what you think!” Where’d that  part go, Leo?",west_wing
3631,bartlet,Did I not say put our guys on the F.E.C.?,west_wing
3632,bartlet,"You’re writing a fascinating version of history, my friend.",west_wing
3633,bartlet,You brought me in on teachers. You brought me in on capital gains. You brought me in  on China. And you brought me in on guns.,west_wing
3634,bartlet,"Leo, if I ever told you to get aggressive about campaign finance or gays in the military,  you would tell me, “Don’t run too fast or go to far.”",west_wing
3635,bartlet,"I have said it, and nothing’s every happened!",west_wing
3636,bartlet,I don’t want to feel like this anymore.,west_wing
3637,bartlet,I don’t want to go to sleep like this.,west_wing
3638,bartlet,This is more important than reelection. I want to speak now.,west_wing
3639,bartlet,This is more important than reelection. I want to speak now.,west_wing
3640,bartlet,This is more important than reelection. I want to speak now.,west_wing
3641,bartlet,You have a strategy for all this?,west_wing
3645,bartlet,"I get nervous around laws that fundamentally assume that Americans can't be trusted.  We’d better have mandatory sentencing, because judges can't be trusted to disperse  even-handed justice.",west_wing
3646,bartlet,"We better have term limits, ‘cause voters can't be trusted to recognize corruption.",west_wing
3647,bartlet,"Oh, and by the way... I say, by the way. When the playing field is leveled and the  process is fair and open, it turns out we have term limits. They're called elections.",west_wing
3652,bartlet,"My father was very fond of the analogy of the Irish lads whose journey was blocked by  a brick wall, seemingly too high to scale. Throwing their caps over the wall, the lads  had no choice but to follow. How many times in the great history of our country have  we come to a wall seemingly too high to scale only to throw our caps to the other side?",west_wing
3653,bartlet," Tomorrow... tomorrow morning, we're going to begin to change the way elections  are supervised in this country. ",west_wing

3715,bartlet,"Kiefer's been here 45 minutes, he's already got me on the playground at recess.",west_wing
3733,bartlet,Toby was just explaining to Al that science is science to everyone.,west_wing
3750,bartlet,I'm hungry and so far nobody has convinced me of anything.,west_wing
3787,bartlet,"Well, yeah, that's cause I answered the phone. ",west_wing
3788,bartlet,"Yeah, I got to be up in four hours, anyway.",west_wing
3812,bartlet,"Well, I wasn't listening to a lot of it.",west_wing
3813,bartlet,"Leo, if there's anyone qualified to talk about the benefits of treatment vs. criminal  action, it's you. Is there anyone whose life would be better right now, if you'd had  gone to jail instead of rehab?",west_wing
3814,bartlet,Thank you. Is there anything else?,west_wing
3817,bartlet,"You fixed it this afternoon, right?",west_wing
3818,bartlet,"No need to apologize, but I accept your apology and now I'm ready, if not eager, to  move on.",west_wing
3819,bartlet,Not for a little while now.,west_wing
3820,bartlet,"Guys, let me tell you what I would like to have happen, right now.",west_wing
3822,bartlet,Josh walking in the door wasn't even close. ,west_wing
3824,bartlet,"I'm fine, thanks. How you doing?",west_wing
3826,bartlet,"See, the part I don't understand is, I got like, 24 armed guards right outside my  bedroom door...",west_wing
3827,bartlet,"I'm a day closer. There'll be more meetings tomorrow. In the meantime, everybody calm  down. Leo’s got your engines fired like you're running Daytona. That's fine. Keep them  there. Guess what? Mistakes are gonna be made. Minimize them, fix them, move on. Kiefer's  numbers got you scared? Listen to me. I have never lost an election in my life. We do  this right, people are going to respond. You all had a good day. ",west_wing
3829,bartlet,You guys should feel free to do this when my wife is here.,west_wing
3830,bartlet,Everybody. Mandy was doing her job. It's time to let her out of the doghouse.,west_wing
3831,bartlet, She was doing her job. C.J.?,west_wing
3833,bartlet,"When you were married to her, did you call her Congresswoman Wyatt?",west_wing

3836,bartlet,"You're whupped, my friend.",west_wing
3837,bartlet,"No, she's been talking to your for a year about Mandatory Minimums. You've been saying  no. Looks like we know who wears the pants in the Ziegler family.",west_wing

3886,bartlet,This could all be for nothing.,west_wing
3887,bartlet,"I mean, if the numbers... ",west_wing
3888,bartlet,All right. Did the guys make any predictions?,west_wing
3889,bartlet,I mean it could be worse than holding at 42.,west_wing
3890,bartlet,"‘Cause if these numbers keep going down, I’m just a guy with Barry Haskell in his office.",west_wing
3891,bartlet,A dress Marine guarding your door?,west_wing
3892,bartlet,"Nah... My thing is, what’s he suppose to be guarding right now? ",west_wing
3897,bartlet,Based on what is he making that claim?,west_wing
3898,bartlet,We’ve been out there for three weeks.,west_wing
3899,bartlet,"We’ve been... we’ve been out there for three weeks. Crossfire, Meet the Press, Charlie  Rose, The Today Show, The Tonight Show, Good Morning Scottsdale...",west_wing
3900,bartlet,"...Time, Newsweek, Popular Mechanics. We’ve been out there saying we’re not talking about  legalization. We are talking about treatment.",west_wing
3902,bartlet,"Well, how do you want to handle it?",west_wing
3904,bartlet,I don’t know. It sounds like we’re soft on the issue.,west_wing
3906,bartlet,Steve Onorato is saying I want to legalize drugs. ,west_wing
3908,bartlet,Hmmm... Leo was in here last night. He said you guys predicted we’d hold steady at 42.  Were you just being optimistic or you really think we held our ground. ,west_wing
3911,bartlet,"Well, okay. Anybody want to offer C.J. the odds? ",west_wing
3912,bartlet,Tell them every administration for the past thirty years has generated that memo.,west_wing
3915,bartlet, It is a country. You know where?,west_wing
3917,bartlet,"It’s actually 607 small islands in the South Pacific. Interestingly, while its total  land mass is only 270 square miles, it occupies more than a million square miles of the  Pacific Ocean. Population is 127,000 and the U.S. Embassy is located in the state of  Pohnpei and not, as many people believe, on the island of Yap.",west_wing
3919,bartlet,I looked at the Federated States of Micronesia. I can’t fire our ambassador.,west_wing
3920,bartlet,Somebody’s going to ask me why I fired him and I’m not gonna be able to come up with  the answer they’re looking for.,west_wing
3922,bartlet,And what happens to the ambassador of Paraguay?,west_wing
3923,bartlet,"Hey, I like this. Of course, if everybody keeps moving up one, then I get to go home.",west_wing
3924,bartlet,"That ambassador is Ken Cochran, isn’t it?",west_wing
3925,bartlet,He’s having an affair with the daughter of the Bulgarian Prime Minister?,west_wing
3927,bartlet,Prime Minister of Bulgaria?,west_wing
3928,bartlet,I got to fire Ken Cochran?,west_wing
3929,bartlet,"All right, then I don’t want it to be because of the girl.",west_wing
3931,bartlet,"Well, it looks to me like there are legitimate grounds for incompetence, but... come up  with different ones, would you? ",west_wing
3932,bartlet,"All right, let’s do it.",west_wing
3933,bartlet,"I need to meet with Ambassador Cochran. He can be found in his office at the U.S Embassy  in Bulgaria, or not. Either way, I’d like the State Department to put his ass on a plane  and have it in this office tomorrow. ",west_wing
3934,bartlet,"It looked like when I said ""Ken Cochran"", that you knew who he was.",west_wing
3998,bartlet,You never paid this girl to have sex?,west_wing
4000,bartlet,"Well, that makes two of us.",west_wing
4003,bartlet,"Toby, are you in here sticking up for Sam?",west_wing
4005,bartlet," Sam, you’re going to spend the morning in the White House Counsel’s office  finding out if you’ve broke any laws.",west_wing
4006,bartlet,You should also call the girl... what’s her name?,west_wing
4007,bartlet,You should call her and tell her the White House deeply regrets the phenomenal inconvenience  she’s about to experience.,west_wing
4008,bartlet,You might also want to point out to her that she probably has a cause of action against  the paper.,west_wing
4009,bartlet,"And you should tell her that if she passes her Bar exam, the U.S. Attorney General will  personally see to it that she’s admitted to the Bar.",west_wing

4650,bartlet,I'm on hold with a guy whose name I've got on an index card. How much governing do you think  is going on around here today? And can you believe I'm on hold?,west_wing
4652,bartlet,Elliot Roush is now polling at 46%.,west_wing
4653,bartlet, I have 3 daughters who grew up in that school district.,west_wing
4654,bartlet,"And he has come back. Like crab grass pulled from the lawn. Not by the root, but by the  other thing.",west_wing
4655,bartlet,Can't tell you how much I'm going to miss you. (to Zoey) You wanted to talk to me?,west_wing
4656,bartlet,"(big sigh) This is real and a man, who makes the Spanish Inquisition look like a Barbara  Walters Special, is now polling at 46% in your school district, for which I have personally  baked things to raise money. (to C.J.) You can go, too.",west_wing
4675,bartlet,Do we know how Tokyo opened?,west_wing
4676,bartlet,Frank Gates and McNamara?,west_wing
4677,bartlet,Those are campaign calls.,west_wing
4678,bartlet,"Because I choose not to, Charlie. Because, however an empty gesture it may seem, I would  like to take some executive notice of the notion that it's probably not a good idea for the  most powerful and influential person in the world to be calling up the people whose laws  he signs and asking them for money! (beat) I'm going to do it, but not behind this desk  and not in this room. What else?",west_wing
4679,bartlet,Yeah. (takes the phone messages) I'll make these calls from the Residence. Tell C.J. I want  to see her in an hour. ,west_wing
4701,bartlet,Yeah. Why has there been no press mentioned that the fact that Elliot Roush was an opponent  of mine in New Hampshire?,west_wing
4703,bartlet,He's running for a seat on the school board up in New Hampshire.,west_wing
4705,bartlet,Why isn't it more than local?,west_wing
4707,bartlet,It's a human interest story.,west_wing
4709,bartlet,"I'm saying, if anyone in the Press Room wanted to do this story that I would comment on the  record.",west_wing
4712,bartlet,I don't care about winning back the House.,west_wing
4713,bartlet,I don't care about winning back the House!,west_wing
4715,bartlet,"C.J., I've known men of faith in my life. Towering men. Men of wisdom and compassion.  Men of all faiths, of healing and peace. Pro choices, pro-life, Republican, Democrat,  men and women of God. Elliot Roush... (long beat) ...is polling at 53%. He's polling  at 53%. He's the front runner.",west_wing
4717,bartlet,"Yeah. It was just a thought, but I mean, obviously, you're right.",west_wing
4725,bartlet,"Toby, I'm drinking the most fantastic thing I've ever tasted in my life: chocolate syrup,  cold milk, and seltzer. I know it sounds terrible, but trust me, I don't know where this  has been all my life.",west_wing
4728,bartlet,"Toby, don't ever let me hear you say that again.",west_wing
4730,bartlet,You want to take a leave of absence.,west_wing
4732,bartlet,"That's no problem, Toby.",west_wing
4733,bartlet,"It's time to get up off the mat, Toby.",west_wing
4736,bartlet," It wasn't a shooting, Toby. It was a lynching. They tried to lynch  Charlie right in front of our eyes, can you believe that?",west_wing
4737,bartlet,"Keyhole satellite photographs. It's the headquarters for West Virginia White Pride  headquarters. It's a diner outside Blacksberg. Every night for the past 12 weeks,  I've picked up the phone and called the Attorney General, fully prepared to say two  wordstake 'em. And then I hang up the phone because I know it'll be better tomorrow  and better the day after that. We saw a lynching, Toby. That's why it feels like this.",west_wing
4739,bartlet,"I'm not sure I can either. But until we are sure, I think we should keep coming into work  every day. ",west_wing
4742,bartlet,"I don't remember. I've been thinking about it for weeks, but I honestly don't remember.",west_wing
4743,bartlet,"Let me look at them while we walk. Toby, go with us, to this radio thing.",west_wing
4744,bartlet,"There'll be crab puffs. New England crab puffs, by the way, made in New England.",west_wing
4745,bartlet,There's Alaskan crab in this White House?,west_wing
4749,bartlet,"Thank you. Thank you, very much. Thanks a lot. I wish I could spend more than a few minutes  with you but the polls don't close in the east for another hour and there are plenty of  election results left to falsify. ",west_wing
4750,bartlet,"You know with so many people participating in the political and social debate through call  in shows, it's a good idea to be reminded...",west_wing
4751,bartlet,...it's a good idea to be reminded of the awesome impact... the awesome impact...,west_wing
4752,bartlet,"I'm sorry, um... you're Dr. Jenna Jacobs, right? ",west_wing
4753,bartlet,It's good to have you here.,west_wing
4754,bartlet,The awesome impact of the airwaves and how that translates into the furthering of our national  discussions but obviously also how it can... how it can...,west_wing
4755,bartlet,"Forgive me, Dr. Jacobs. Are you an M.D.?",west_wing
4756,bartlet,"I'm asking, 'cause on your show, people call in for advice and you go by the name of  Dr. Jacobs on your show. And I didn't know if maybe your listeners were confused by that,  and assumed you had advanced training in Psychology, Theology, or health care.",west_wing
4757,bartlet,Good. I like your show. I like how you call homosexuality an abomination.,west_wing
4758,bartlet,"Yes, it does. Leviticus.",west_wing
4759,bartlet,"Chapter and verse. I wanted to ask you a couple of questions while I had you here.  I'm interested in selling my youngest daughter into slavery as sanctioned in Exodus 21:7.  (small chuckles from the guests) She's a Georgetown sophomore, speaks fluent Italian, and  always clears the table when it was her turn. What would a good price for her be? While  thinking about that, can I ask another? My Chief of Staff, LeoO McGarry, insists on working  on the Sabbath, Exodus 35:2, clearly says he should be put to death. Am I morally obligated  to kill him myself or is it okay to call the police? Here's one that's really important,  'cause we've got a lot of sports fans in this town. Touching the skin of a dead pig makes  us unclean, Leviticus 11:7. If they promise to wear gloves, can the Washington Redskins  still play football? Can Notre Dame? Can West Point? Does the whole town really have to be  together to stone my brother, John, for planting different crops side by side? Can I burn  my mother in a small family gathering for wearing garments made from two different threads? ",west_wing
4760,bartlet,"Think about those questions, would you? One last thing, while you may be mistaking this  for your monthly meeting of the Ignorant Tightass Club, in this building, when the President  stands, nobody sits.",west_wing
4793,bartlet,Would you like me to show you the list of dead millionaires? ,west_wing
4794,bartlet,"Leo, AIDS is caused by HIV. You just named a group of people that have a higher mortality  rate across the board. Morning, Charlie. ",west_wing
4795,bartlet,They have a Health Minister who doesn't think AIDS is connected to HIV! ,west_wing
4796,bartlet,He got diced and sliced by a woman named Ainsley Hayes. ,west_wing
4797,bartlet,"I know, I had Charlie pull 'em for me. Where's she been? ",west_wing
4798,bartlet,"No, not as a joke, I mean we should hire her as a reality. We should hire her. ",west_wing
4799,bartlet,So are half the people in this country. ,west_wing
4800,bartlet,"She's smart, she's not just carping. She feels a sense of something. ",west_wing
4801,bartlet,Yeah.  Of duty. Of civic duty. ,west_wing
4802,bartlet,I can sense civic duty a mile away. ,west_wing
4803,bartlet,"Good morning, Mr. President. ",west_wing
4804,bartlet, You can tell your caption editors that Bartlet's the third guy from the  right. ,west_wing
4806,bartlet," Yes, Katie, I'm trying to shore up the sub-Saharan vote. ",west_wing
4807,bartlet,It's an international health crisis; there's nothing I'm not considering. ,west_wing
4808,bartlet," That's right. His name is Norman Borlaug, by the way, and he won the Nobel  Peace Prize in 1970. ",west_wing
4810,bartlet, I think you're absolutely right about the kind of miracle we need. I think  we're gonna make a lot of progress in the next few days. ,west_wing
4811,bartlet,"It was called dwarf wheat, which produces heavy yields without its stalk falling over  from the weight of the rain. ",west_wing
4812,bartlet,"What am I, Farmer Bob? It was wheat, and there was more than there used to be. ",west_wing
4813,bartlet,"Leo, as hard as you might try, the Republican Party isn't going anywhere. ",west_wing
4814,bartlet,"Charlie, I want to hire a woman whose voice I think would fit in nicely around here,  she's a conservative Republican. Do you think I should do it? ",west_wing
4815,bartlet,"We might do that, Leo. A hundred million Republicans; we might hire as many as two of  them. But for now, hire this girl. ",west_wing
4816,bartlet, I don't know. She's a lawyer. Put her in the counsel's office. ,west_wing
4817,bartlet,"Appeal to her sense of duty. And smooth it over with the staff. Really, I don't want to  hear from them. ",west_wing
4818,bartlet,"When they close the book on me and you, it will say that at this moment you were not  there for me, and for that, obviously, there'll be some kind of punishment. ",west_wing
4875,bartlet,"When do I see pictures, and who's gonna tell me what I'm looking for? ",west_wing
4876,bartlet, I want Fitzwallace and Nancy. ,west_wing
4878,bartlet,"Mr. President, three hours ago there was a coup in your country. The AFRC has taken the  capital. ",west_wing
4879,bartlet,"We're finding out. The information's coming very quickly now from our people in Angola  and Sudan. Mr. President, I think you should sit. ",west_wing
4880,bartlet,"No, no, sir! My State Department is offering you asylum in the U.S. ",west_wing
4881,bartlet,You can't go home. You can't go home! ,west_wing
4882,bartlet,"They have the capital, they have the radio station, they have the television station. ",west_wing
4883,bartlet,I'm evacuating the embassy. ,west_wing
4884,bartlet,"I don't need to trade you! If they won't give me the Americans, we'll go and get 'em  ourselves, and they know that, and they'll let 'em go. ",west_wing
4886,bartlet,They will shoot you the moment you step off the plane.,west_wing
4887,bartlet,"We think your brother and your two sons are already dead. We think your wife is being  hidden in Kenya. You understand, don't you, why I can't offer military assistance? ",west_wing
4888,bartlet,They executed him in the airport parking lot. ,west_wing
4889,bartlet,Okay. I'll see you Monday. He gets up and leaves the office. ,west_wing
4894,bartlet,"That’s almost hard to believe, Donna.  How is everybody?",west_wing
4895,bartlet,"Thank you. Let’s do this in one, shall we?",west_wing
4896,bartlet,One-take Bartlet. That’s what old Jack Warner used to call me.,west_wing
4897,bartlet,"Good morning. This month, as autumn is in full bloom in much of the nation, the weekends will  be devoted by many of you to leaf peeping and football... watch... ing... ",west_wing
4898,bartlet, I’m sorry. Leaf peeping? Is that something we do now?,west_wing
4899,bartlet,"Sorry, everybody. This is gonna be it. Four is my lucky number.",west_wing
4900,bartlet,"Five is my lucky number. ""Fifth-take Bartlet"" -- that's what Jack Warner used to call me.",west_wing
4901,bartlet,"Yeah, because I used to be a contract player in Hollywood and I'm 97 years old.",west_wing
4927,bartlet,"'Our farming families stand for the values that keep our nation strong: faith, calm perseverance,  and patience...'",west_wing
4928,bartlet,"It's a bit of a bad time, Lionel...",west_wing
4929,bartlet,"And we will, Lionel, but right now I don't know if you noticed but there are thirty or forty  other people in the room, many of whom have donated significant amounts of money to the Democratic  Party, so perhaps you could put a tighter grip on your horses and we will talk about it later.",west_wing
4930,bartlet,"Well, obviously, Lionel Tribbey is a brilliant lawyer whom we cannot live without, or there  would be very little reason not to put him in prison. Let's try again.",west_wing
4947,bartlet,"Good afternoon, Mrs. Landingham.",west_wing
4948,bartlet,"Not for long, Mrs. Landingham.",west_wing
4949,bartlet,Who cares? It’s been 14 weeks! Do these curtains close?,west_wing
4950,bartlet,Yes. You’re right... where?,west_wing
4951,bartlet,New Hampshire is an hour and a half away by plane. I don’t think I have that kind of time.,west_wing
4952,bartlet, Yes! We have a bedroom right here in the building. That was so smart!,west_wing
4953,bartlet,Oh God... I hate plutonium!,west_wing
4954,bartlet,Where the hell is Cochran’s Mills?,west_wing
4955,bartlet," I don’t think it’s gonna take more than a couple of minutes, but I like your  confidence.",west_wing
4956,bartlet,Can’t we just close the curtains?,west_wing
4979,bartlet,Is this still my first term?,west_wing
4980,bartlet,"It's evening. It's dark outside, Charlie.",west_wing
4981,bartlet,Excuse me... No. I can't. I've got to go.,west_wing
4982,bartlet,"Kids, I am so sorry. I have to go now, to a special meeting... of the government. I will mail  you all an autographed copy of the picture we took together. And one day, you will all understand.",west_wing
4983,bartlet,I'm going to a special meeting...,west_wing
4984,bartlet,Sure. Would you like to get that smile off your face before I send you on special assignment  to the Yukon?,west_wing
4994,bartlet,"Guys, it's very important that nobody tries to kill me in the next hour or so.",west_wing
4995,bartlet,I was on a conference call with Cardinal Law and the Archbishop of Chicago.,west_wing
4996,bartlet,"Yeah. ""Excuse me, Your Eminence, but the First Lady is a little randy, and she says I'm good  to go"".",west_wing
4997,bartlet," Good, take your clothes off.",west_wing
4998,bartlet,"Abbey, you have two minutes, or I swear to God I'm gonna get Mrs. Landingham drunk.",west_wing
4999,bartlet,What was that thing you were doin'?,west_wing
5000,bartlet,"Tonight, in Pennsylvania.",west_wing
5001,bartlet,"It was a monument dedication, a statue?",west_wing
5002,bartlet,"You went all the way to Cochran's... whatever to dedicate a monument to Nellie Bly? Abbey, you  can really pass that kind of thing along.",west_wing
5003,bartlet,"You haven't changed into the ""special garment"".",west_wing
5004,bartlet,"Yeah. You know what I did, just then, that was stupid?  I minimized the importance of the  statue that was dedicated to Nellie Bly, an extraordinary woman to whom we all owe a great deal.",west_wing
5005,bartlet,This isn't happening to me.,west_wing
5006,bartlet,Then she's the one I want to beat the crap out of.,west_wing
5007,bartlet,"She sounds like an incredible woman, Abbey. I'm particularly impressed that she beat a fictional  record. If she goes twenty-one thousand leagues under the sea I'll name a damn school after her.  Let's have sex.",west_wing
5008,bartlet,I couldn't possibly hear about the rest of the iceberg right now.,west_wing
5009,bartlet,Keep talking. I'm just gonna sit here and think about plutonium and the things I can do with it.,west_wing
5011,bartlet,"Do it live, that's what I always say.",west_wing
5012,bartlet,"By the way, sweet knees, the Statue of Liberty.",west_wing
5013,bartlet,Right there at the front door to the country!,west_wing
5014,bartlet,"No, it's okay.  I'll be right behind you.",west_wing
5015,bartlet,Is this about Ed Barrie?,west_wing
5017,bartlet,"Go ahead and let him out of the box. Say what you want about Barrie, and I could say plenty,  but the man was the first one in and the last one out of a war that I didn't want anything to  do with. Man's earned the right to say whatever he wants. Let him out of the box, would you?",west_wing
5057,bartlet,It's like trying to run the country with Barnum Bailey and his sister Sue.,west_wing
5058,bartlet,"Leo, will it be possible for just two of them to speak at once?",west_wing
5066,bartlet,Could I have a couple of aspirin and a weapon of some kind to kill people with?,west_wing
5067,bartlet,What do you want to do?,west_wing
5072,bartlet,When does Konanov get here?,west_wing
5073,bartlet,"No high level meetings, right?",west_wing
5074,bartlet,"Yeah, but this could be window.",west_wing
5075,bartlet,We've got see if it's doable.,west_wing
5076,bartlet,You got anything more to say?,west_wing
5189,bartlet,"No more Rouge Nations, huh?",west_wing
5190,bartlet,"What's doing, Claudia Jean?",west_wing
5194,bartlet,"Yeah, they've been way off base.",west_wing
5195,bartlet,"Not so much the second one. But the first, third and fourth were silly. And the fourth  was mean spirited.",west_wing
5197,bartlet,"First of all, it wasn't Danny.",west_wing
5199,bartlet,Nah. It's going to look petty and petulant. You know why?,west_wing
5200,bartlet,Because it's petty and petulant.,west_wing
5202,bartlet,"Yeah, but not having to run for anything tends to help with honesty and decisiveness.   Thanks, Charlie, send Danny in, would you please?",west_wing
5204,bartlet,"I really don't, C.J.  Is this personal?",west_wing
5205,bartlet,"I hear things, I don't understand most of it, but I hear it.",west_wing
5207,bartlet,"He's a great reporter, and you're a great Press Secretary. And that's why it was  never going to work while the two of you had those jobs.",west_wing
5208,bartlet,"Danny, I think you guys have had your heads up your asses for the last few weeks,  I hope you don't mind me saying so.",west_wing
5209,bartlet,"Not only that, but I think you've been trying to bait me. Which is a waste of time,  paper and ink. I'm like 50 times smarter than any of you will ever be. I have an  election to win in two years, and I'm not about to alienate the Washington Post.",west_wing
5210,bartlet,"I'll tell you what I will do, though, I'm cancelling our subscription.",west_wing
5212,bartlet,"No, I meant just mine and Abbey's. I'll borrow a copy from somebody.",west_wing
5213,bartlet,"Yeah. Take it easy, Danny.  C.J.'ll give you all the access you want.",west_wing
5220,bartlet,"Vasily! Vasily Konanov, why you're the last person I expected to be where they told  me to go.",west_wing
5221,bartlet, I don't know who this is.,west_wing
5222,bartlet,What the hell are you doing?,west_wing
5223,bartlet,"I'm not the transportation secretary. You will join the WTO when you reduce the 300%  tariff on America cars, and with a nuclear weapon pointed at my head I will not talk  to you about nuclear compatibility.",west_wing
5224,bartlet,"Vasily, you're a reformer and you're going to do good things in Eastern Europe and I'm  looking forward to the day when you're President. But until that time comes, my State  Department deals with the government of the Ukraine. Now you can go home and so exactly  what you wanted to do.  To say you met with the President of the United States.",west_wing
5225,bartlet,"Thanks, you can take off for the night, Charlie, we're done.",west_wing
5226,bartlet," Tony Marino's going to abstain, huh?",west_wing
5227,bartlet,"He was a great public servant, Toby, a great Senator.",west_wing
5229,bartlet,Yeah. and then he was voted out of office five years later by the people of Bristol.,west_wing
5231,bartlet,"I know. The fact is the opponents of the treaty are on both sides of the isle.  You've got to respect them, Toby. They're politicians and they're flying in the  face of overwhelming public opinion.",west_wing
5233,bartlet,"Can I tell you something, honestly? This is one of those situations where I couldn't  give a damn what the people think. The complexities of a global arms treaty, the  technological, the military, the diplomatic nuances, it's staggering, Toby. 82% of  the people cannot possibly be expected to reach an informed decision.  You  want to call a session anyway?",west_wing
5236,bartlet,"You know we forget sometimes, in all the talk about democracy we forget it's not  a democracy, it's a republic. People don't make the decisions, they choose the  people who make the decisions. Could they do a better job choosing? Yeah. But  when you consider the alternatives, anyway, Abbey's in New Hampshire, you want  to come up for a cigar?",west_wing
5237,bartlet,"The day's over, Toby. We'll live to fight another one. Come up, and I'll beat  your ass at chess.",west_wing
5239,bartlet," If anyone's out there, I'm signing off. Have a good night.",west_wing
5240,bartlet,He wants to meet with me on the way back? ,west_wing
5241,bartlet,The Assistant Energy Secretary is flying to Portland in the middle of the night so he  can meet with me on Air Force One on the way back? ,west_wing
5242,bartlet,The day-to-day experience of my life has changed in many ways since taking this job. ,west_wing
5249,bartlet,You didn't say 'Michigan sucks'? ,west_wing
5250,bartlet,I thought you said 'Michigan sucks.' ,west_wing
5251,bartlet,You think they've got oil? ,west_wing
5252,bartlet,Anything else I should know? ,west_wing
5253,bartlet,I'll see you tomorrow night. ,west_wing
5255,bartlet,I think it's great you decided to make the trip. ,west_wing
5257,bartlet,"Yes. I remember now. You made one of your funny, funny jokes. ",west_wing
5293,bartlet,What does the island of Qais mean to you? ,west_wing
5295,bartlet,"About two hours ago we stopped a Cyprus-flagged ship called ""The Nicosia."" We believe  it to be carrying petroleum products out of Iraq, in violation of UN sanctions. ",west_wing
5297,bartlet,"We board the stip, we test a sample of the oil, we determine its point of origin and  if it's black-market, the oil company gets fined. ",west_wing
5300,bartlet,It dramatically exceeds the fine! So what do you think we should do? ,west_wing
5302,bartlet,It would please me if you would lead the press in a rendition as we pass over South Bend. ,west_wing
5303,bartlet,"All five verses, please. ",west_wing
5315,bartlet,What are we trying to do? ,west_wing
5316,bartlet,All right. The F-18 pilots? ,west_wing
5317,bartlet,"Leo, just so they know--it's a tanker full of crude oil. If they miss the propeller and  hit something else--- ",west_wing
5318,bartlet,Okay. Why don't I have a final draft of tomorrow morning's...? ,west_wing
5335,bartlet,It's a northeastern thing? ,west_wing
5336,bartlet,What about Miami and San Francisco? ,west_wing
5337,bartlet,So pavement's going to win this battle? ,west_wing
5338,bartlet," Ernesto Perez Balladares, former President of Panama. You know where  he went to school? Notre Dame. ",west_wing
5341,bartlet," Yeah, but we gotta do it later. The Tokyo Exchange just opened  and I'm gonna gauge the impact on Pacific Rim Banking Reforms. A subject economics  scholars could take years on, I will take 20 minutes. ",west_wing
5343,bartlet,I thought we left on time. ,west_wing
5345,bartlet,You don't like late flights? ,west_wing
5347,bartlet,A long flight across the night? You know why late flights are good? Because we cease to  be earthbound and burdened with practicality. Ask the impertinent question. Talk about  the idea nobody has thought about yet.  Put it a different way. ,west_wing
5348,bartlet,If you absolutely must. ,west_wing
5349,bartlet,"Mao took a lot of long plane flights, Toby. Look out your window. Is there anything more  romantic than that?  ",west_wing
5351,bartlet,"No, we left at 905 because they thought my budget meeting might run over. But wouldn't  that have been great if that was the reason? ",west_wing
5352,bartlet," You don't like ""permanent revolution""? ",west_wing
5354,bartlet,"We're flying, Toby. Live a little.  Yeah? ",west_wing
5355,bartlet,"Oh, Leo, just take the damn boat... ",west_wing
5367,bartlet,"Actually, it was two rooms. ",west_wing
5368,bartlet,Italian stonecutters were paying her to teach their kids English in the basement of the  rectory. They put up a wall and made it two rooms as a thank you gift. ,west_wing
5370,bartlet,I haven't heard the big idea yet. ,west_wing
5372,bartlet,"Yeah.  What  happened to 100,000 new teachers? ",west_wing
5374,bartlet,We can give incentives. ,west_wing
5376,bartlet,"Well, it's not doing the trick. ",west_wing
5378,bartlet,I find fault with that formula. ,west_wing
5379,bartlet,Why can't that idea be floated? ,west_wing
5382,bartlet, I'll be in my study. It's an incredible sky tonight. ,west_wing
5416,bartlet,It doesn't do anything to hold the ship in Bahrain ,west_wing
5417,bartlet,"Yeah. You know what's going to happen? They'll sell off the cargo in a friendly port.  780,000 metric tons of gas oil against a two million dollar fine for the oil company. ",west_wing
5418,bartlet,Which their profits from the sale will more than cover. We're not providing much of a  disincentive to evade U.N. sanctions. ,west_wing
5419,bartlet,"If we're going to have sanctions at all, I think we should make them stick. I think  that we should confiscate the cargo, seize the ship, sell the oil and use the money  to beef up anti-smuggling operations. ",west_wing
5432,bartlet,I don't care about the constitutional argument. It's gay bashing. It's legislative gay  bashing. How do I put my name on it? ,west_wing
5434,bartlet,Pocket veto's a politician's way out. ,west_wing
5436,bartlet,"If I'm going to sign it in January, why am I vetoing it now? ",west_wing
5438,bartlet,I'm sure the gay community can't wait to thank me. ,west_wing
5439,bartlet, You can look at the policy numbers and Article IV and Social Security  benefits. It doesn't matter. It's just wrong. We shouldn't be defining love and we  certainly shouldn't be ill-defining it. It's wrong. This is the job for... This is the  job of somebody else. ,west_wing
5440,bartlet,I should get out a rubber stamp that says 'Josiah Bartlet votes no.' ,west_wing
5442,bartlet,I should get out a rubber stamp! ,west_wing
5450,bartlet,Because I was thinking about becoming a priest. ,west_wing
5452,bartlet,Because I like to bother you. ,west_wing
5455,bartlet,"Toby, you should sit down. We're landing in one minute and ten seconds. ",west_wing
5456,bartlet,I set my watch to the cockpit computer. You should sit down. ,west_wing
5457,bartlet,Do you know why the Assistant Energy Secretary is on the plane? ,west_wing
5460,bartlet,They're taking the tanker to Bahrain and then the company's going to make a profit. ,west_wing
5461,bartlet,The Marriage Recognition Act is going to be law. ,west_wing
5462,bartlet,"Well, it's a start I guess. ",west_wing
5505,bartlet,"Chef's choice. Twice the amount of carbon, which means it'll hold a sharp edge up to  ten times longer and you can see the handle which texturized molded polymer has no  rivets or air pockets.",west_wing
5506,bartlet,This is an American knife.,west_wing
5507,bartlet,No German knives for us.,west_wing
5508,bartlet,"Nah... Nah. No, the balance isn't right.",west_wing
5509,bartlet,Yeah. You know what we need?,west_wing
5510,bartlet,You tell him they already briefed me on San Diego.,west_wing
5511,bartlet,"The German's know how to make a knife, Charlie!",west_wing
5513,bartlet,She's a controversial woman.,west_wing
5514,bartlet,It is when it's a recess appointment. A recess appointment assumes the Senate's gonna have no  problem with the nominee. The Senate is going to have a considerable problem with this nominee.,west_wing
5517,bartlet,"I got to say... look, I'm just... Toby, I'm not wild about the woman. I've known her for 25  years and I think she's all about Eve.",west_wing
5521,bartlet,Assistant Secretary for Primary and Secondary Education.,west_wing
5522,bartlet,"Not patronate, yet she's qualified.",west_wing
5584,bartlet," The Missermeister. Meridian 3000 series. One-piece forged blade,  riveted palm handle.",west_wing
5585,bartlet,I don't like the handles.,west_wing
5587,bartlet,You met with Chinese embassy officials?,west_wing
5589,bartlet,"Christians aren't persecuted in China. Since they aren’t oppressed, they don't qualify  for refugee status.",west_wing
5592,bartlet,Yeah. They'll be coached.,west_wing
5594,bartlet,"Do you guys know what a ""shibboleth"" is?",west_wing
5595,bartlet,"It's from the Bible. ""Then said now unto him, say now “shibboleth"" and he said ""sibboleth""  for he could not frame to pronounce it right."" It was a password, the way the army used to  distinguish true Israelites from impostors sent across the river Jordan by the enemy.",west_wing
5596,bartlet,I'm having one of the Chinese refugees flown here. I'll meet with him tonight.,west_wing
5599,bartlet,"I'm going to ask him to say ""Shibboleth.""",west_wing
5605,bartlet,He speaks English. He’s a chemistry professor.,west_wing
5606,bartlet, There was a while there I wanted to be a chemistry professor.,west_wing
5607,bartlet,I never actually studied chemistry.,west_wing
5608,bartlet,I’m Jed Bartlet. This is Leo McGarry.,west_wing
5609,bartlet,Thanks for coming all this way.,west_wing
5610,bartlet,Would you care to sit down? It’s perfectly all right.,west_wing
5611,bartlet," There are some sandwiches here. If you get hungry, feel free to  eat as much as you want.",west_wing
5612,bartlet,There are questions as to the veracity of your claim to the asylum.,west_wing
5613,bartlet,How did you become a Christian?,west_wing
5614,bartlet,Who’s the head of your church?,west_wing
5615,bartlet,"Can you name any of Jesus’ disciples?  If you can’t, that’s okay. I usually can’t  remember the names of my kids, or for that matter...",west_wing
5616,bartlet, It was a pleasure to meet you.,west_wing
5617,bartlet,We don’t have to grant asylum.,west_wing
5618,bartlet,Before... when it happened before... how did it work?,west_wing
5619,bartlet,I need to talk to the Governor of California.,west_wing
5640,bartlet,"Mrs. Landingham, can I look at a copy of the Thanksgiving proclamation?",west_wing
5641,bartlet,I was standing at the door.,west_wing
5642,bartlet, Can I look at a copy...?,west_wing
5643,bartlet,I once test-drove the Komin Yomada.,west_wing
5644,bartlet,Not wild about it--How about this?,west_wing
5645,bartlet,"Because it’s something we pass on. Something with a history so we can say, “My father  gave this to me. His father gave it to him, and now I’m giving it to you.”",west_wing
5646,bartlet,"Charlie, my father gave this to me, and his father gave it to him, and now I’m giving it to you.",west_wing
5647,bartlet,The fully tapered bolster allows for sharpening the entire edge of the blade.,west_wing
5648,bartlet,Yeah. This was made for my family by a Boston silversmith named Paul Revere.,west_wing
5649,bartlet,"I’m proud of you, Charlie.",west_wing
5651,bartlet,Not too late to stop yourself.,west_wing
5653,bartlet,I already pardoned a turkey.,west_wing
5656,bartlet,Aren’t I gonna get a reputation for being soft on turkeys?,west_wing
5658,bartlet,"No, I’m not just gonna get this--What the hell is going on?",west_wing
5660,bartlet,"If the Oscars were like that, I’d watch.",west_wing
5661,bartlet,Just buy the second turkey.,west_wing
5662,bartlet,There’s not much I can do.,west_wing
5664,bartlet,The turkey hasn’t committed a crime.,west_wing
5665,bartlet,"C.J., I have really no judicial jurisdiction over birds.",west_wing
5668,bartlet,He’s in high school and he doesn’t know I can’t pardon his turkey?,west_wing
5670,bartlet,"C.J., if we don’t and I mean completely overhaul public education in this country...",west_wing
5673,bartlet,Well said. Is that the turkey?,west_wing
5674,bartlet," By the power vested in me by the Constitution of the United States,  I hereby pardon you.",west_wing
5675,bartlet,"Morton, I can’t pardon a turkey. If you think I can pardon a turkey, then you have got  to go back to your school and insist that you be better prepared to go out in the world.",west_wing
5676,bartlet," No. I tell you what I can do. I’m drafting this turkey into military service.  In the meantime, somebody will be drafting a check, which will have my signature on it,  so the folks can buy themselves a Butterball.",west_wing
5678,bartlet, What’s wrong with him?,west_wing
5680,bartlet, I’m still waiting for the thing.,west_wing
5683,bartlet,"By the way, the Latin word for “yam” is “dioscorea.”",west_wing
5684,bartlet,About the Chinese refugees?,west_wing
5685,bartlet,Yeah. Can you believe it?,west_wing
5687,bartlet,"That detention center was being guarded by the 22nd Division of the California National  Guard. Now, what does it say about our reserve army?",west_wing
5688,bartlet,"“Well over three and a half centuries ago, strengthened by faith and bound by a common  desire for liberty, a small band of pilgrims sought out a place in the New World where  they could worship according to their own beliefs. Now therefore I, Josiah Bartlet,  President of the United States, by virtue of authority and laws vested in me, do hereby  proclaim this to be a National Day of Thanksgiving.”",west_wing
5690,bartlet," And call in the Red Cross. We didn’t do anything illegal.  We’re not involved in any massive criminal conspiracy. There’s no way I was letting  them go, and we needed to help China save face, so now they can tell their people that  the mighty American military was overpowered by...",west_wing
5692,bartlet,"You think I would’ve sent him back if he’d failed catechism? Let me tell you something.  We can be the world’s policeman. We can be the world’s bank, the world’s factory, the  world’s farm. What does it mean if we’re not also...",west_wing
5693,bartlet,"We’ve made it into the New World, Josh. You know what I get to do now? I get to proclaim  the National Day of Thanksgiving.",west_wing
5694,bartlet,You can feel the adventure. ,west_wing
5695,bartlet,NASA's great at naming things. ,west_wing
5696,bartlet,"Mercury, Apollo, Atlantis, the Sea of Tranquility, the Ocean of Storms... ",west_wing
5697,bartlet,"First time I heard ‘Galileo V,’ the way the imagination immediately... It reminded me of the  way folks in my generation felt when we heard ""Yellow Submarine."" ",west_wing
5698,bartlet,We really did all want to live in a yellow submarine. ,west_wing
5700,bartlet,Tell me where we're going again. ,west_wing
5702,bartlet,"Say it again. Your imagination, like a child, will explode with unrestrained possibilities  for adventure. ",west_wing
5703,bartlet,You didn't say it right. ,west_wing
5709,bartlet,We have questions in advance? ,west_wing
5711,bartlet,"Katie, sixth grade, Green Oaks Junior High School, Austin, Texas, asks, ""How old is the planet  Mars?"" That's a great question, Katie. The planet Mars is 4.6 billion years old. ",west_wing
5713,bartlet,"Yes, God forbid, that while talking to 60,000 public school students, the President should  appear smart! ",west_wing
5715,bartlet,"I don't show off.  Stevie, fourth grader, PS 31, Manhattan, asks, ""What is the  temperature on Mars?"" Well, Stevie, if one of our expert panelists were here, they would tell  you the average temperature ranges from 15 degrees to minus 140. ",west_wing
5717,bartlet,I converted it to Celsius in my head. ,west_wing
5718,bartlet," ""Good morning! I'm speaking to you live from the West Wing of the White House. Today  we have a very unique opportunity to take part live in an extremely historic event which...""  Whoa, boy... ",west_wing
5719,bartlet," Scott. ""Unique"" means ""one of a kind."" Something can't be very  unique, nor can it be extremely historic. ",west_wing
5722,bartlet, He's gonna make some changes. ,west_wing
5763,bartlet,"Okay, but then, let's bring the curtain down. I got a great night planned. I got two books  on Mars and one on Galileo himself. I'm gonna go to the Residence and read. ",west_wing
5764,bartlet,"Nothing after 6:30. I'm gonna go to the Residence and read about Mars, which while colder  and drier, has four Earth-like seasons. ",west_wing
5765,bartlet,Did Buddy Holly come back? ,west_wing
5766,bartlet,The Reykjavik Symphony Orchestra? ,west_wing
5767,bartlet,"I know where Reykjavik is, Charlie. I wish I was there right now.",west_wing
5768,bartlet,The Reykjavik Symphony Orchestra? ,west_wing
5769,bartlet,"Which we did, by canceling the meeting yesterday. ",west_wing
5770,bartlet,"So to make up for it, I'm going to see the Reykjavik Symphony. ",west_wing
5771,bartlet,"With, uh, Ambassador... ",west_wing
5772,bartlet,I'll give you a thousand dollars if you don't make me go. ,west_wing
5773,bartlet,There was an explosion?,west_wing
5774,bartlet,What's the problem Jack? ,west_wing
5775,bartlet,It's not a refinery fire? ,west_wing
5776,bartlet,There was an explosion in a missile silo? ,west_wing
5777,bartlet,"If a missile exploded, is it possible it was armed? Was there a warhead? ",west_wing
5778,bartlet,"Did they really think we weren't gonna see it, Leo? ",west_wing
5779,bartlet,"If they asked, we could help. ",west_wing
5780,bartlet,"Yeah. Yeah. Galileo Galilei. He sat in a cathedral in Pisa. He watched a lamp suspended from  the ceiling as it oscillated back and forth. He used his pulse to keep time and discovered  that the period of oscillation was independent of the size of the arc. A few years later he  contradicted the theory that a heavier body falls faster than a lighter one. Which took some  guts back in 1609, when you consider that the theory he was contradicting was Aristotle's. ",west_wing
5781,bartlet, I really do. Have Sam and C.J. come along tonight. ,west_wing
5782,bartlet,"He contradicted Aristotle, Charlie. ",west_wing
5820,bartlet,What do you think happened? ,west_wing
5821,bartlet,Where are we with the Russian ambassador? ,west_wing
5822,bartlet,"Leo, I want you to see her as soon as she can get here. Thank you everybody. ",west_wing
5823,bartlet,We lost the signal from Galileo. ,west_wing
5848,bartlet,Do you know what they’re playing? ,west_wing
5849,bartlet,The Reykjavik Symphony. Do we know what they’re playing and for how long they’re playing it? ,west_wing
5850,bartlet,Modern music sucks. Anything written after 1860 sucks. ,west_wing
5851,bartlet,Played on teapots and gefilte fish. ,west_wing
5852,bartlet,"If he wants more time, I’d be happy to take a rain check. ",west_wing
5853,bartlet,This is not classical music. It is not classical music if the guy finished writing it this  afternoon. ,west_wing
5855,bartlet,I don’t get that many opportunities to talk with kids. ,west_wing
5857,bartlet,"Yeah, but let’s let 'em work for a while. ",west_wing
5859,bartlet,Why is he hiding from Mallory? ,west_wing
5861,bartlet,"I took trombone lessons when I was a kid. Not much solo music written for the trombone,  but I wanted to play in the marching band. ",west_wing
5862,bartlet,"One afternoon, during the game, I gave it all I had and ended up throwing the slide into the  end zone, which is more than I can say for our quarterback. ",west_wing
5863,bartlet,Would you excuse me just one moment? ,west_wing
5864,bartlet,Yeah.  Somebody was draining hydrogen? ,west_wing
5910,bartlet, Your paranoia was a lot sexier back when you guys are communists.,west_wing
5911,bartlet,"From where do you get the nerve and try to dictate terms on this? Are you insane? Your missile  regimen is in a horrifying state of disrepair. Your best-trained operators have left or died.  The ones you’ve got aren’t paid very much when they’re paid at all. They don’t have enough to  train with. Your ICBMs are well behind their warranty life. Not seven weeks ago, you mistook  a Norwegian weather rocket for a submarine launch Trident missile because the CrossTac  information never made it to the Russian C&C system.  Leo, at the time the  S.S.19 exploded, it was being drained of its liquid hydrogen in an attempt by deserting  soldiers to -- wait for it --",west_wing
5912,bartlet,Steal the warhead!  When were you gonna tell us about that? You realize how dangerous...,west_wing
5913,bartlet,"Well, I am concerned with the welfare of the Russian people, but that’s not what they pay  me for. You guys fall asleep in the switch in Minsk, and I’ve got a whole hemisphere hiding  under the bed. How do you not tell us this is going on? How do you not ask us for help?",west_wing
5914,bartlet,"Yeah, thanks. We’re sending in NATO inspectors.",west_wing
5915,bartlet,Get your Foreign Minister on the phone.,west_wing
5916,bartlet,I really don’t know from where you guys get the nerve.,west_wing
5917,bartlet,"This is still my office, right?",west_wing
5919,bartlet,Earth’s giving it instructions?,west_wing
5920,bartlet,Like my kids. All right...,west_wing
5925,bartlet,"Yeah, okay. What about the stamp?",west_wing
5933,bartlet,All right. Everybody go away. We’ll call you back when there’s a NASA update.,west_wing
5935,bartlet,Did you hear the end of the concert?,west_wing
5937,bartlet,"Well, first of all, let’s not kid ourselves. The Reykjavik Symphony can play. These guys have  some serious game. In this particular case, their talents were tragically misapplied to an  atonal nightmare of pretention, but after intermission...",west_wing
5938,bartlet,"They played a piece by a new composer. First, I wasn’t hearing it. I had 19 different things  on my mind, but then I did, and C.J., it was magnificent. It was genius. He built these themes,  and at the beginning, it was just an intellectual exercise, which is fun enough, I guess,  but then in the fourth movement, he just let it go. I really didn’t think I could be surprised  by music anymore. I thought about all the times this guy must’ve heard that his music was no  good... I’ve got to write this guy a letter.",west_wing
5940,bartlet,I’m gonna wait up for a while. See if we hear anything. It’s out there somewhere... It’s so close.,west_wing
5944,bartlet,You said it right that time.,west_wing
5997,bartlet,What’s going on? Sit down.,west_wing
5998,bartlet,Is he in there alone? Is there a crew?,west_wing
5999,bartlet,Is there any chance he’s trying to contact the ground and can’t?,west_wing
6000,bartlet,Is his intention to defect with a military asset or his intention to blow something up?,west_wing
6001,bartlet,Don’t our fighter pilors have to go through some kind of psychological testing?,west_wing
6002,bartlet,Let me ask a ridiculous question and I know the answer is no. Is there any way to bring  this plane down without shooting it down?,west_wing
6003,bartlet,What about populated areas?,west_wing
6033,bartlet,They're going to know when the F-16's have painted him before I will. ,west_wing
6034,bartlet,When I was in tenth grade me and my friends took my dad's Ford Country Squire for a  joyride to Vermont. He locked me in the garage till Easter. ,west_wing
6035,bartlet,What do you think we should do with this pilot once we get his ass on the ground? ,west_wing
6036,bartlet,I'm gonna sign them all by hand. ,west_wing
6037,bartlet,I'm gonna sign them all by hand. ,west_wing
6038,bartlet,I don't like the whole idea of the autopen. ,west_wing
6039,bartlet,Let's do them all by hand. How many can there be? ,west_wing
6040,bartlet,How many am I sending out? ,west_wing
6041,bartlet,I'm sending out 1.1 million Christmas cards?  ,west_wing
6042,bartlet,Who are the other million? ,west_wing
6043,bartlet,"Okay, but some of those were death threats. ",west_wing
6044,bartlet,"Well, I'm not signing 1.1 million cards. ",west_wing
6096,bartlet,OPEC will find a way to punish us. ,west_wing
6097,bartlet,"If the Saudis are that concerned, why don't they just make the old faster? ",west_wing
6105,bartlet,Let's set up a meeting. ,west_wing
6106,bartlet,You sold me. We're setting up a meeting.  ,west_wing
6109,bartlet,"Well, I'm just talking about a meeting, but if I decide to do it, the President controls  the SPR and not Congress. ",west_wing
6111,bartlet,The two aren't related. ,west_wing
6112,bartlet,I'm saying the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and forgiving the IMF debt are not related. ,west_wing
6115,bartlet,We'll talk to him tonight. ,west_wing
6116,bartlet,"At the Christmas party, we'll take him aside... ",west_wing
6120,bartlet,"Josh, Didion's a good guy, we can talk to him. ",west_wing
6124,bartlet,We'll talk with Didion tonight? ,west_wing
6125,bartlet,"By the way, it's not intervention in a free market if that's what he's worried about. ",west_wing
6126,bartlet,It's not free trade if the price of oil is being controlled by a cartel. ,west_wing
6127,bartlet,"Sam, you'll be in on this? ",west_wing
6139,bartlet,"You look good, Charlie. ",west_wing
6140,bartlet,Like Woodrow Wilson and top hats. ,west_wing
6141,bartlet,"Charlie, this is how Statesmen dress. This is how they dress in times of occasion. ",west_wing
6239,bartlet,Who was the idiot who set off the smoke detector?,west_wing
6241,bartlet,They had me on the Truman balcony for 6 minutes in my underwear.,west_wing
6242,bartlet,In January? No. Why do you ask?,west_wing
6244,bartlet,We're having Vermont maple syrup?,west_wing
6246,bartlet,I don't give a damn if they call it the Monroe doctrine. What the hell are we doing  serving Vermont maple syrup?,west_wing
6249,bartlet,New Hampshire syrup is what we serve in this White House.,west_wing
6250,bartlet,It's a breakfast. We eat. We pose for pictures. You do a post-game conference. Everybody  gets the hell out of here and I don't have to be so Officer Crupky.,west_wing
6314,bartlet,Who’s the next meeting?,west_wing
6315,bartlet,"I don’t need a cheat sheet.  Kim Woo, he won a bronze medial for  fencing, he’s a Buddhist, and he enjoys European History. You see Charles’s even thought  it’s a handshake, I’m able to make him feel like a friend and that’s a little thing they  call ‘people skills.’",west_wing
6316,bartlet,"The man’s an Olympic athlete, Charlie. I wouldn’t say that to his face.",west_wing
6317,bartlet,"on glasses, reads] Ladies and Gentleman.  She’s a woman?",west_wing
6318,bartlet,Did you mark that down? ,west_wing
6319,bartlet, Did you know it’s bad luck to toast with water?,west_wing
6320,bartlet,"Yeah, you don’t want to make a toast with water.",west_wing
6321,bartlet,"From Greek mythology, I’m almost sure. You lose your spirit. ",west_wing
6322,bartlet,"That’s a great question, Charlie, and I could tell you, but I think it’s better if you look  it up on your own.",west_wing
6323,bartlet, Remind me to tell Sam that’s good.,west_wing
6324,bartlet,And remind me not to make a toast with water.,west_wing
6408,bartlet,I think the whole damn thing is bizarre.,west_wing
6409,bartlet,The right moment for what?,west_wing
6410,bartlet,"Well, I’m not sure there is a right moment for you to ask me that, Charlie.",west_wing
6411,bartlet,Donna wants me to call Karen Cahill and make it clear she wasn’t hitting on her when she gave  her her underwear.,west_wing
6412,bartlet,There can’t possibly be nuclear weapons in Kyrgyzstan.,west_wing
6413,bartlet," I’m going to bed. If anybody thinks of new ways for us to make friends  don’t hesitate to wake me. Or, you know, just feel free to start a fire.",west_wing
6420,bartlet,"Mr. Sumatra, I understand you're a sports fan. ",west_wing
6421,bartlet,"Okay. Well, golf's not a sport. It's fine. Don't get me wrong but let's not you and  I confuse it with things that men do. ",west_wing
6422,bartlet,"You know, we're going to Bangkok in June, I think.  June, Charlie? ",west_wing
6423,bartlet,"Best hotel in the world, right?",west_wing
6424,bartlet, Make sure I see that. ,west_wing
6425,bartlet,"Mr. Sumatra, I accept your letter of credence from King Adulyadej and by affixing my  signature and seal,  do hereby declare you to be an ambassador  extraordinary and plenipotentiary. ",west_wing
6426,bartlet,May our people know peace and prosperity.  Congratulations. ,west_wing
6427,bartlet,We've got some gifts here and we're going to stand for pictures. ,west_wing
6428,bartlet," Madam, congratulations. ",west_wing
6429,bartlet,And I'm sure somebody will come along soon thereafter and tell it didn't work. ,west_wing
6430,bartlet,Cause it's not going to work. ,west_wing
6431,bartlet,"Well, I can't make you Thailand's ambassador to the United States because I just signed  that guy's letter.  ",west_wing
6432,bartlet,You know what you are? You are the Charlie Brown of missile defense. The Pentagon is Lucy. ,west_wing
6433,bartlet,Peanuts. Charlie Brown. ,west_wing
6434,bartlet,"Leo, were you born at the age of 55? ",west_wing
6435,bartlet,"Charlie Brown wanted to kick a football and Lucy would hold it, except she'd pull it  away at the last minute and Charlie Brown would fall on his butt.",west_wing
6436,bartlet,"No, but each time Lucy would find a way to convince Charlie Brown that this time she  wouldn't pull the ball away. But she would and, once again, Charlie Brown would fall  on his butt.",west_wing
6437,bartlet,The DOD bringing you to the Situation Room every time they run a new missile test so  that you come tell me how great it works so I'll put money in the NMD system. ,west_wing
6438,bartlet,And it's going to hit my garage in New Hampshire when?,west_wing
6439,bartlet,"Okay, but we don't have anybody out there right now do we? ",west_wing
6440,bartlet,"When we stay at the Oriental in Bangkok, we have to check out James Michener's typewriter.",west_wing
6441,bartlet,Is that silence usually a pretty good sign? ,west_wing
6442,bartlet,It was just enthusiastic. ,west_wing
6443,bartlet,"When you consider the size of outer space, Leo, that's not so bad. ",west_wing
6444,bartlet,"By the way, the words you're looking for are ""Oh good grief."" ",west_wing
6544,bartlet,"I think a lot of people don't realize that Swedes have lived in Sweden more than 5,000  years longer than nearly any other European people. ",west_wing
6545,bartlet,"In fact, Gothic tribes from Sweden played a major role in the disintegration of the  Roman Empire, did they not? ",west_wing
6546,bartlet,So you've got that to answer for! ,west_wing
6547,bartlet,"Sweden has a 100% literacy rate, Leo, a hundred percent! How do they do that? ",west_wing
6548,bartlet,"That tenth one! See, if there were just nine... ",west_wing
6549,bartlet,"Leo, seriously, when they were telling you that on the phone, how stupid did you think  you'd sound saying that to me? ",west_wing
6550,bartlet,Do we need to decide this right now? ,west_wing
6551,bartlet,And we can't take it for granted that everyone pretty much fundamentally opposes arson? ,west_wing
6552,bartlet,It would be hypocrisy not to hold our friends to the same standard... ,west_wing
6553,bartlet,Yet it feels strange to score political points by doing the right thing. ,west_wing
6554,bartlet, I'm victim to my own purity of character.,west_wing
6555,bartlet,"Okay, well, it's not a kind of a possum, so why don't you get me that information.  Toby doesn't want it in the speech? ",west_wing
6556,bartlet," 2,000 environmentalists are going to try to kill me tomorrow night! ",west_wing
6557,bartlet,They're going to come at me with vegan food and pitchforks! ,west_wing
6558,bartlet,"Still, I'd like you to get between me and any boiled seaweed you see coming my way. ",west_wing
6559,bartlet,Leo just talked to me. ,west_wing
6561,bartlet,"Yeah, I'm not doing this for the politics, I'm doing it because it's the right thing  to do. ",west_wing
6563,bartlet,A lynx isn't a possum. ,west_wing
6566,bartlet,How did Sam feel about this?  Toby? ,west_wing
6568,bartlet,"I'm not going to tell you how to run your office, Toby. ",west_wing
6569,bartlet, Vegan food. Coming at me all night long. ,west_wing
6597,bartlet, It's good to have you here. ,west_wing
6598,bartlet,What made you agree to take the post? ,west_wing
6599,bartlet,"Listen, I gotta go a few blocks across town to give an address on global warming and the  future of our planet. That's not something you're interested in, right? ",west_wing
6600,bartlet,"Okay. Well, stay here and fight with Leo about something. We'll get you some dinner.  I'll be back in an hour. We'll do your thing and then enjoy your reception. ",west_wing
6635,bartlet,"That was Chairwoman Shelly Lubis I just got off the phone with. Before that was a  conference call with Jamie Schwartz of the Environmental Defense Fund, Bryce Davis  of the Sierra Club, and three Democratic Congressman from the Subcommittee on Energy  and the Environment. The number of different words they had for ""manipulative,""  Leo, there's no way they didn't have a thesaurus open in front of them. Bryce Davis  said if I keep this up, he's going to encourage Seth Gillette in a thirdparty bid.",west_wing
6636,bartlet,"I said for fifty bucks and a ride to the airport, Gillette could have the job right now.",west_wing
6637,bartlet,I politely reminded him that it's probably not a good idea to threaten the president.   I want to know when you're pushing me towards the missile  shield it's not because you want me to look strong on defense.,west_wing
6638,bartlet,Would you tell Charlie I'm ready?,west_wing
6640,bartlet,It's almost hard to believe that you're not on the National Security Council.,west_wing
6642,bartlet,"John! Let me explain why you've been waiting. I have to see people in the order they  arrive, and you got beat by Argentina.",west_wing
6643,bartlet,You also lost out on preferred seating for the State of the Union. ,west_wing
6644,bartlet,Where are you on the missile shield?,west_wing
6645,bartlet,"Well, it's a discussion for serious men. They say a statesman is a politician who's  been dead for fifteen years. I'd like us to be statesmen while we're still alive.  Lord Marbury, I accept your letter of credence from Queen Elizabeth, and, by affixing  my signature and seal, do hereby declare you to be Ambassador Extraordinary and  Plenipotentiary.",west_wing
6650,bartlet,Bob Novak just said this was the speech of my political life. You know how many times  I’ve heard that?,west_wing
6652,bartlet,Abbey’s already in her seat?,west_wing
6653,bartlet," I said, my wife’s in her seat?",west_wing
6674,bartlet,"Mr. Finney, would you tell the Speaker I’d like to see him please?",west_wing
6753,bartlet, I owe you money for that?,west_wing
6754,bartlet,I owe you anything for that?,west_wing
6755,bartlet,Don’t you already get paid?,west_wing
6756,bartlet, Is there anything in particular you’d like me to say?,west_wing
6757,bartlet,What’s going on with the police officer?,west_wing
6758,bartlet,We’re going to get knocked off the story by a...,west_wing
6759,bartlet,They can be identified as drug agents?,west_wing
6760,bartlet,"Yeah, they may have blown their cover. ",west_wing
6761,bartlet,"Mickey, how do we know they’re still alive?",west_wing
6762,bartlet,And they kill our guys unless Santos releases Juan Aguilar from a prison in Bogotá.,west_wing
6763,bartlet,How many Frente casualties?,west_wing
6764,bartlet,You think we’re headed for Vietnam?,west_wing
6765,bartlet,How long is it going to take Special Forces to mobilize?,west_wing
6766,bartlet," Well then, I want our people to keep talking to Nelson Guerra.  But in three hours I want to be ready to kick in the back door.",west_wing
6767,bartlet,"Leo, I’d like the Senior Staff. Would you round them up? ",west_wing
6768,bartlet, I’ll be wandering the halls.,west_wing
6771,bartlet,I never even knew we HAD a nightclub down here.,west_wing
6772,bartlet,"Yeah. Ainsley, I wanted to say hello and to you know... mention ""a lot of people  assumed you were hired because you’re a blonde, republican sex kitten"" and well,  they’re obviously wrong. Keep up the good work. ",west_wing
6773,bartlet, You know we’re meeting?,west_wing
6781,bartlet,They said you were in here.,west_wing
6782,bartlet,"Abbey, so I indicated we were open to new ideas. How did I fail you this time?",west_wing
6783,bartlet,To make a 90 minute speech into an 80 minute speech things had to go.,west_wing
6784,bartlet, That’s not what tonight’s...,west_wing
6785,bartlet,That was three years ago.,west_wing
6786,bartlet,I have Special Forces headed to Columbia on ready alert. They'll be ready for an order  in a little less than three hours.,west_wing
6787,bartlet,The Frente took five DEA Agents in Putumayo...,west_wing
6788,bartlet,All right.  I’ve got to go.,west_wing
6789,bartlet,It was just three hours ago I gave the State of the Union. ,west_wing
6790,bartlet,I'm not allowed to smoke inside anymore. ,west_wing
6791,bartlet,Up to the point where you accidentally burn holes in priceless antiques. ,west_wing
6792,bartlet,I smoke two cigarettes a day. ,west_wing
6793,bartlet,"For who... Russian spy satellites?  George Bernard Shaw says, ""You don't live  longer, it just seems longer.""",west_wing
6794,bartlet,I'm not sure it was either.  Is it time?,west_wing
6795,bartlet,Where are we? Everyone sits. ,west_wing
6796,bartlet,Tell me what happens when I give the order.,west_wing
6797,bartlet,What'll they do when they get there? ,west_wing
6798,bartlet,Nineteen guys are going to have to lie face down in the jungle until sunset? ,west_wing
6799,bartlet,They're moving the hostages from where to where? ,west_wing
6800,bartlet,Code name's Cassiopeia. ,west_wing
6801,bartlet,"Mickey, you look like you want to say something. ",west_wing
6802,bartlet,"Are we going to keep them alive longer, or is it just going to seem longer? ",west_wing
6803,bartlet,I've been given reason to believe they'll be tortured at Villacerreno. They're U.S. drug  agents. They know things these people want to know.,west_wing
6850,bartlet,This isn't cold. It's crisp. ,west_wing
6851,bartlet,"Well, you're a big wussie. ",west_wing
6852,bartlet,It'll leave the Bishop open. ,west_wing
6853,bartlet,Abbey's pretty pissed at me. ,west_wing
6854,bartlet,You know I have this image in my mind of the dead soldiers coming back from Vietnam...  the caskets coming off the plane. I don't know from where. ,west_wing
6855,bartlet, Caskets coming off the plane? ,west_wing
6856,bartlet,I'll see you in the morning. ,west_wing
6863,bartlet,Thanks for having breakfast with me. ,west_wing
6864,bartlet,Did you order something? ,west_wing
6865,bartlet, You want scrambled eggs? ,west_wing
6866,bartlet,Could we get these guys some scrambled eggs? ,west_wing
6868,bartlet,"Bring them some food, would ya? ",west_wing
6869,bartlet,You guys understand I can't discuss with you any rescue mission that may or may not be  in play right now? ,west_wing
6871,bartlet,Nelson Guerra wants me to tell President Santos to release Juan Aguilar from prison. ,west_wing
6873,bartlet,"I have a gun to my head and I'm not making that phone call. I inherited the war on drugs  from a President, who inherited it from a President, who inherited it from a President  before that. I'm not a hundred percent sure who we're fighting, but I know we're not  winning. Ten years ago we spent $5 billion fighting drugs and we did such a good job that  last year we spent $16 billion. Sixty percent of Federal prisoners are in jail on drug  charges as opposed to two and a half percent that are there for violent crime. We  imprison a higher percentage of our citizens than Russia did under Communism and South  Africa under Apartheid. Somewhere between 50 and 85 percent of our prison population has  a drug or alcohol abuse problem. We've tried ""just say no."" I don't think it's going to  work.  I'm mentioning this because I'd like you to give me any  thoughts you might have on the subject. ",west_wing
6889,bartlet,"You aren't leaving till tonight, right? ",west_wing
6890,bartlet,Men and women are completely different in this regard. ,west_wing
6891,bartlet,"I don't know. I just had breakfast with Sam and Josh. Toby's having breakfast with  Seth Gillette, who's every bit as pissed at me as you are.",west_wing
6892,bartlet,We didn't get a chance to talk again last night. ,west_wing
6893,bartlet, Yes and I'd like to go about my day without this black cloud around me so  I'd like to talk now! ,west_wing
6894,bartlet," What are you, my Zen master? Can I be in charge of my own mind?! ",west_wing
6895,bartlet, I feel better already. ,west_wing
6906,bartlet,Why is she still in there? ,west_wing
6907,bartlet,Why don't we get her out here? ,west_wing
6908,bartlet,"Ainsley, why don't come on out of there...",west_wing
6909,bartlet,How you doing? We met last night.  You were singing and dancing in a  bathrobe. ,west_wing
6910,bartlet,Why were you in the closet? ,west_wing
6911,bartlet,They won't let me smoke inside but you can pee in Leo's closet. ,west_wing
6912,bartlet,"I appreciate you coming to work for me, Ainsley. You're an exceptionally bright young  woman. Is your father proud of you?",west_wing
6913,bartlet,I bet he is.  Listen...,west_wing
6914,bartlet,"Charlie, get the door. ",west_wing
6915,bartlet,Did we lose the hostages? ,west_wing
6916,bartlet,What are you talking about? ,west_wing
6917,bartlet,What are you talking about?! ,west_wing
6918,bartlet,How many guys were on the Blackhawk? ,west_wing
6919,bartlet, So I've got nine more guys now on the ground we've got to get back. ,west_wing
6920,bartlet,I want the President of Colombia on the phone. I want a translator in this room right now. ,west_wing
6921,bartlet,How the hell did that happen? ,west_wing
6922,bartlet,We've never anticipated the possibility that somebody might try that? ,west_wing
6923,bartlet, IS THAT HOW I JUST LOST NINE GUYS TO A DAMN STREET GANG WITH A HAM RADIO!?,west_wing
6924,bartlet,Is somebody translating on the other end? ,west_wing
6925,bartlet," Mr. President, this is the President of the United States. ",west_wing
6926,bartlet," Mr. President, 90 minutes ago the United States invaded  Colombian airspace. Two Blackhawk helicopters went into Tres Encinas with 20 Delta  Commandos on intelligence that the hostages were being moved. One of the Blackhawks  was shot down. They were nine military fatalities.",west_wing
6927,bartlet, I'd like to ask for your assistance in confirming that the five hostages  are still alive.,west_wing
6928,bartlet," I'm not going to ask you, Miguel.",west_wing
6929,bartlet," Well, I appreciate your making that offer but I don't think  that's a very good idea. ",west_wing
6930,bartlet," Okay. Thank you, Mr. President.",west_wing
6933,bartlet,Juan Aguilar runs one of the largest drug cartels in the world. ,west_wing
6934,bartlet,He has produced $15 billion worth of cocaine in two years. ,west_wing
6935,bartlet,"He's murdered or ordered the murder of eight Supreme Court justices, a pro-extradition  Prime Minister and three Federal police officers in Bogotá. And from his prison cell I  guarantee you he orchestrated the kidnapping of five U.S. DEA agents and the killing  of their rescuers! ",west_wing
6936,bartlet,I'm not letting him out.  I'll share a cell with him before I let  him out. I want military options! ,west_wing
6943,bartlet,Do we know where they are? ,west_wing
6944,bartlet,What would it take to get them back?,west_wing
6945,bartlet,What would it take to wipe them out? ,west_wing
6946,bartlet,Yeah. What would it take? ,west_wing
6947,bartlet, You've really got to ask yourself what's the point in being a Super Power  anymore. ,west_wing
6948,bartlet, And then there's the repack! ,west_wing
6949,bartlet,"First there's the preliminary, or the dry run. Then there's the actual packing.   Abbey, you're just going away for two days, right? ",west_wing
6950,bartlet,"A guy with a shoulder thing shot down a Blackhawk. Everybody's dead.  Nine guys. Meanwhile, they've moved the hostages 60 miles into the jungle where we'd  need a pair of tweezers to get them out. ",west_wing
6951,bartlet,No.  I didn't make the decision to run again. I wouldn't do that without you. ,west_wing
6952,bartlet,I didn't make the decision to run again! ,west_wing
6953,bartlet,"That's what we do, Abbey. We run for things! From the day a Congressman is sworn in he's  got to raise $10,000 a week so he can get reelected! A President gets to govern for 18  months. We try to get people to vote for us and in the process we hope the people force  us to do good things. ",west_wing
6954,bartlet,I've had one episode in two years. ,west_wing
6955,bartlet, I know what it's going to...,west_wing
6956,bartlet,Call me when you get there. ,west_wing
6965,bartlet,"Hey, Charlie. You shouldn't be out here without a coat. ",west_wing
6966,bartlet,"Let me tell you something, Leo...  After heroin and cocaine, tobacco is next. ",west_wing
6967,bartlet,"Leo, I can't possibly reverse our...",west_wing
6968,bartlet,I can't possibly reverse our position on negotiating...,west_wing
6969,bartlet,There were just 14 people in this room who heard Santos make me the offer. ,west_wing
6970,bartlet,You know what Truman Capote said was the bad part about living outside the law? ,west_wing
6971,bartlet,"You no longer have the protection of it. What's to stop me? Two hundred CIA operatives...  Black Ops. Two hundred guys with no wives, no kids, no parents.  I send 200  operatives down there. Monday morning I read in the paper Juan Aguilar is dead. What's  to stop me? ",west_wing
6972,bartlet,It was the Queen's Rook. That's why I couldn't trade the Bishop. It was over six moves  ago. Arrange for their immediate release. ,west_wing
6973,bartlet, If they so much as experience turbulence on their way out...,west_wing
6974,bartlet,I want to go to Dover later tonight. ,west_wing
6978,bartlet,I'll call their families afterwards...,west_wing
7081,bartlet,They're trying to export their way out of their own economic problems. ,west_wing
7082,bartlet,"And by dumping low priced steel on the U.S., you know what they're asking for? ",west_wing
7083,bartlet,"They're begging for a protectionist response. Steel and mining employ a hundred and  seventy thousand workers. They're not going to sit around while discount steel comes  flying into... how you doing?   They're going to want retaliatory tariffs, and you know what that means? ",west_wing
7084,bartlet,A return to Smoot-Hawley and the Great Depression. ,west_wing
7085,bartlet,"Leo, I'm walking over to the press and telling them that retaliatory tariffs are gonna  cost American taxpayers 800,000 dollars for every job saved. ",west_wing
7086,bartlet,Why didn't you tell me six hours ago? ,west_wing
7092,bartlet,"Thank you.  I've had it, C.J. I've absolutely had it! ",west_wing
7093,bartlet,What the hell is Danny Concannon doing calling my kids? ,west_wing
7094,bartlet,He knows better than that! They all know better than that! But Danny... ,west_wing
7095,bartlet,"C.J., you're going to suspend his credentials for six months, and I don't give a damn.  His paper wants to cover the President, they can send someone else. ",west_wing
7097,bartlet,I was told it was Danny. ,west_wing
7100,bartlet,"The Allman Brothers, Josh? ",west_wing
7102,bartlet,"Tokyo is willing to show economic restraint, in exchange for a good fielding shortstop  and a left-handed reliever... Who's against us so far? ",west_wing
7105,bartlet,Who's coming to her defense? ,west_wing
7107,bartlet,"Yes, I understand I've been congratulated for denouncing a movie I've never heard of. ",west_wing
7108,bartlet,I've got to hand it to you guys you've pulled off a political first. You've managed to win  me the support of the Christian Right and the Cheech and Chong Fan Club in the same day. ,west_wing
7112,bartlet,Charlie? Would you arrange for my middle daughter to come see me at her earliest possible  convenience? ,west_wing
7113,bartlet,"Ah, screw her convenience. Get her ass down here.",west_wing
7128,bartlet,"...in consumer costs per job saved. Retaliatory tariffs on steel imports are a disaster.  Anyone wants to check my math, they're more than welcome to. ",west_wing
7129,bartlet,"Anybody wants to shove the Golden Gate Bridge up Japan's ass, they're more than welcome  to do that too. ",west_wing
7130,bartlet,"Ellie, thanks for coming. ",west_wing
7131,bartlet,Did you get down here okay? ,west_wing
7132,bartlet,Did you take an airplane? ,west_wing
7133,bartlet,"That's because you go to school at Johns Hopkins, right? ",west_wing
7134,bartlet,"And Johns Hopkins is in Baltimore. I'm asking 'cause Baltimore is a 45-minute car ride  from Washington, D.C. and we hardly see you anymore. So, I thought either you transfered  to a different medical school, they moved Johns Hopkins, or they moved Baltimore.  Are any of those things true? ",west_wing
7135,bartlet,"Okay. And this is accurate, right? This quote. ""My father won't fire the Surgeon General.  He would never do that."" ",west_wing
7136,bartlet,"Eleanor, when you put your head down, your hair falls in your face, and I can't see your  face, and I can't hear what you're saying. Now look at me, and talk to me!",west_wing
7137,bartlet,What the hell are you doing talking to a reporter? ,west_wing
7138,bartlet," Well, I'm sure  before you gave the quote you cleared it with the Communications Office. I'm sure you  went over the exact wording with C.J. Cregg and coordinated with White House strategy  so that the timing was right in the news cycle. I'm certain you consulted the appropriate  party leadership because you're a pretty knowledgeable operative having spent so much  time with me. Ellie? ",west_wing
7139,bartlet,"There is politics involved in this, Ellie. And you knew it would make me unhappy and  that's why you did it and that's cheap. ",west_wing
7140,bartlet,"Well, you sure didn't do it to make me happy! ",west_wing
7141,bartlet,"Mom gets back first thing in the morning, and we're running a movie tonight if you want  to stay over. ",west_wing
7142,bartlet,"Send him in.  Charlie... Give me just a minute, would you? ",west_wing
7159,bartlet,Is that your resignation? ,west_wing
7160,bartlet,Did you not think that playing down the dangers of drug use sent a dangerous signal  as well? ,west_wing
7161,bartlet,"Millie, did you put her up to it? ",west_wing
7162,bartlet,"""My father won’t fire the Surgeon General, he would never do that."" You didn’t put her  up to it? ",west_wing
7163,bartlet,"You didn’t pick up the phone after Josh came to see you and say, ""Ellie, it’s your  godmother, let’s stick it to your old man, and paint him into a corner?"" ",west_wing
7164,bartlet, Why haven’t I ever been able to get her to like me? I’m asking you. ,west_wing
7165,bartlet,"I was running for President, where the hell was she? ",west_wing
7166,bartlet,Not like Zoey and Liz. ,west_wing
7167,bartlet,She’s always belonged to Abbey. ,west_wing
7168,bartlet,How did I frighten her? ,west_wing
7169,bartlet,"I was elected two years ago, she’s 24 years old! ",west_wing
7170,bartlet,It never seemed to intimidate Zoey or Liz. ,west_wing
7171,bartlet,"No, no, no. I will bear with the nonsense of the Christian right and the Hollywood  left and the AFL-CIO and the AARP and the Canubus society and Japan, but I will not  stand and allow someone to tell me that I love one of my children less than the others.   She’s frightened of me? ",west_wing
7172,bartlet,"I wanted to be so mad at her. I heard the news and my first thought was... My god,  ""King Lear"" is a good play.  ""My father won’t fire the Surgeon General, he would  never do that."" I wanted to be so mad at her. But the truth is, it’s the nicest thing  she’s ever said about me. ",west_wing
7173,bartlet,I don’t accept your resignation. ,west_wing
7174,bartlet,These are the bigger things. I don’t accept your resignation.   You work for me. You go when I tell you to. ,west_wing
7175,bartlet,"Tell C.J. when she gives Millie our support on Monday, she can mean it. ",west_wing
7177,bartlet,"You know, Josh, I think if you ever have a daughter, you’re going to discover there  are worse reasons in the world to do something. Sit down, we’re coming to the good part. ",west_wing
7178,bartlet,"I said, how you doing? ",west_wing
7179,bartlet,"You know, we’re coming up to the good part. ",west_wing
7180,bartlet,You want to bet me your tuition no one in this room is going to shush me? ,west_wing
7181,bartlet,I hear you’re thinking about ophthalmology. ,west_wing
7182,bartlet, Why would you want to study people’s feet? ,west_wing
7183,bartlet,Then what’s children’s medicine?,west_wing
7184,bartlet,I thought it was obstetrics. ,west_wing
7185,bartlet,And what’s the study of feet? ,west_wing
7186,bartlet,Hmmm?  The only thing you ever had to do to make me  happy was come home at the end of the day. ,west_wing
7187,bartlet,"So, endocrinology would be what? Disorders of the gallbladder? ",west_wing
7188,bartlet,"I’m pretty sure you’re wrong about that, I think endocrinology is your sub-specialty  of internal medicine, devoted to the digestive system. ",west_wing
7189,bartlet,"Are you sure it’s not nephrology, immunology, cardiology, or dermatology? ",west_wing
7190,bartlet,Okay. Here comes the good part.,west_wing
7218,bartlet,I don’t really need to see the ten-year numbers.,west_wing
7219,bartlet,Have the ten-year projections ever been close to accurate?,west_wing
7220,bartlet,Within a trillion dollars.,west_wing
7221,bartlet,"Okay. Bring me the ten-year projection, a Ouija board and a magic wand.",west_wing
7222,bartlet,That name sounds familiar. ,west_wing
7223,bartlet,Yes. I remember being locked in a steamer trunk. ,west_wing
7224,bartlet,"There were actual steamers in there with me, Charlie. I was in there with seafood. ",west_wing
7225,bartlet,"What plaid flannel-wearing, cheese-eating, yahoo of a milkman governor signed that idiot  bill into state law?  It was me, wasn’t it? ",west_wing
7226,bartlet,"No, don’t go ahead with the site. I just...  Tell my brother to hang on, would you?  I’ll make a decision. I don’t know what the damn hurry is. ",west_wing
7281,bartlet,"Let’s do calls in the residence, okay? ",west_wing
7282,bartlet,I think there were a couple of late memos.,west_wing
7283,bartlet,I’m going to head home. ,west_wing
7284,bartlet,I’ll make calls from the residence. ,west_wing
7285,bartlet,"Well, there’s this wooded land on the Connecticut River, but the Abenaki Indians are  claiming it’s an ancient burial ground. ",west_wing
7286,bartlet,"There’s a magnificent bluff overlooking an orchard in Orford and the owner is willing,  if not eager, to donate the land. ",west_wing
7287,bartlet,The owner’s doing 40 months at Allenwood for securities fraud. ,west_wing
7288,bartlet,"This is how long I get before I have to start with the library? Two years? And the first  six months was figuring out how to work the phones? Oh, by the way, they’ve changed the  phones again. ",west_wing
7289,bartlet,"This is the last job I’ve ever going to have. This is the last time I’m going to come to  work with people. I swear to God, I feel like I was just starting to get good at it. ",west_wing
7290,bartlet,I’ll see you tomorrow. ,west_wing
7432,bartlet,Come have dinner with me.,west_wing
7433,bartlet,Pierre Boileau is cooking tonight. You want to have dinner?,west_wing
7434,bartlet,"Well, I can tell you that the man specializes in a reinterpretation of classic Provençale  cuisine. Cassoulet, duck with green olives...",west_wing
7435,bartlet,"Well, don't you think you deserve one?",west_wing
7436,bartlet,"His specialty is his dessert, tomate du saltambique.",west_wing
7437,bartlet,"Passion fruit, kiwi and hazelnuts, and...",west_wing
7438,bartlet,Let's go. Leave the cell phone.,west_wing
7439,bartlet,We're not leaving the building. People can find you.,west_wing
7440,bartlet,Could Howard Stackhouse possibly be a bigger horse's patoot?,west_wing
7441,bartlet,"He's a curmudgeon, a grouchy old crank.",west_wing
7442,bartlet,You are. I am full of mirth.,west_wing
7443,bartlet,"He was all over me the first year. He called me, ""Bartlet the Inert.""",west_wing
7444,bartlet,"I'm a reformer. I'm the most liberal President he's ever served under. His hero, Hubert  Humphrey, once, you know...",west_wing
7445,bartlet,That's right.  I feel bad.,west_wing
7446,bartlet,His wife died a few years ago. I didn't go to the funeral.,west_wing
7447,bartlet,"I was kind of busy running for President, Leo.",west_wing
7448,bartlet,"Tomate du Saltambique, my friend.",west_wing
7449,bartlet,"Hi. Hang on.  They thought I was going to be eating with Abbey, so...",west_wing
7450,bartlet,"We'll just, you know, pretend there's no candlelight.",west_wing
7451,bartlet,"Leo, you have a deputy who's, frankly, a lot smarter than you are. Whatever it is, let  him handle it. Who are you talking to?",west_wing
7453,bartlet,"No, she's up at the Manchester house.",west_wing
7454,bartlet,"No, it really sucks, but thanks.",west_wing
7455,bartlet,"Did you hear that? He said, ""Very good, sir"". Where do they learn that?",west_wing
7456,bartlet,I just feel like we don't talk anymore.,west_wing
7457,bartlet,See you're not even listing.,west_wing
7458,bartlet,"I'm just saying we work all day, and then the day's over, and we go out to dinner and  you're still working, and you know, I'm sitting here. No time to talk.",west_wing
7459,bartlet,I made a deal with Abbey... 'cause of my thing.,west_wing
7460,bartlet," My thing, by the way, is the reason that Hoynes stepped up on oil.",west_wing
7463,bartlet,How does he not just tell me?,west_wing
7464,bartlet,"How does he not come to me and say ""Jed, this is my grandson and there are lots more like  him and there are lots more to come. Can you help us out?""",west_wing
7465,bartlet,Damn it. He knows we would have gotten it done. Why doesn't he tell me?,west_wing
7467,bartlet,"Hey. Hey Donna, you need something?",west_wing
7469,bartlet,"C.J., that phone message was for real. He's not going to stop till he drops.",west_wing
7470,bartlet,"C.J., let me tell you something. Don't ever, ever underestimate the will of a  grandfather. We're mad men. We don't give a damn. We got here before you and they'll  be here after. We'll make enemies, we'll break laws, we'll break bones but you will  not mess with the grandchildren.",west_wing
7471,bartlet,C.J.... If I told you to screw the print deadline what would you want to do right now?,west_wing
7473,bartlet,Give him some dignity right? And give him a rest. The guy's going to collapse out there.,west_wing
7474,bartlet,Screw the print deadline. Leo?,west_wing
7475,bartlet,We will talk about the other thing later.,west_wing
7476,bartlet,Though it's not the worst idea in the world.,west_wing
7477,bartlet,I was in the House. I know nothing about Senate rules.,west_wing
7479,bartlet,What time is it? Let's wake up a parliamentarian.,west_wing
7480,bartlet,We're going to get one of them to walk in there. Charlie!,west_wing
7481,bartlet,"I want to call Senators. We'll start with our friends. When we're done with those two,  we'll go on to the other 98.",west_wing
7483,bartlet,There's no damn holiday for us either.,west_wing
7484,bartlet,"C.J., no kidding, make this happen.",west_wing
7492,bartlet,"Trust me just this once, you grouchy old son of a bitch.",west_wing
7504,bartlet,I closed the embassies in Tanzania and Brussels.,west_wing
7505,bartlet,I don’t have to make that call yet.,west_wing
7506,bartlet,He scheduled a trip to New Hampshire?,west_wing
7507,bartlet,You think Toby’s reaction is going to be the same as the public’s?,west_wing
7508,bartlet, The staff’s reaction will be what?,west_wing
7533,bartlet,"Hey, Toby. You want a drink?",west_wing
7535,bartlet,"You know what I just found out recently? To be called ""bourbon,"" it has to come from  Kentucky. Otherwise it’s called sour mash. An Algerian-born terrorist named Reda Nessam  was arrested at the Canadian border yesterday with a U-Haul containing ten 2-ounce jars  filled with nitroglycerin.",west_wing
7537,bartlet,"No. Anyway, on advice from State and Intelligence, I closed the embassies in Tanzania  and Brussels.",west_wing
7538,bartlet,"They want me to order the airports, heighten security, but it’s a holiday weekend.  I don’t know. Toby, I got to tell you something...",west_wing
7540,bartlet,I don’t know. They do it...,west_wing
7542,bartlet,"About an hour. Toby, around ten years ago, for a period of a few months, I was feeling  run down and I had a pain in my leg. They both eventually subsided, but then eight  years ago, the pain came back, as well as numbness. My vision would be blurry sometimes  and I’d get dizzy. During an eye exam, the doctor detected abnormal pupil responses  and ordered an MRI. The radiologist found plaque on my brain and spine. I have a  relapsing-remitting course of MS.",west_wing
7543,bartlet,"I have Multiple Sclerosis, Toby.",west_wing
7546,bartlet,It's... I don't know... it's the good kind of MS.,west_wing
7547,bartlet,"Yeah, as opposed to secondary progressive.",west_wing
7548,bartlet,Yeah. MS is a chronic disease of the central nervous system. Symptoms can be as mild as  numbness or as severe as paralysis.,west_wing
7550,bartlet,No. That's the good news. The bad news is there's no cure.,west_wing
7552,bartlet,Ever turn into secondary progressive?,west_wing
7572,bartlet," The plural of surgeon general isn't surgeon generals, it's surgeons general.  Like attorneys general, or courts martial. Nobody was asked to lie. That was Garreth from  the FAA. Upon interrogating Reda Nessam, they believe it's possible that another rental  car crossed the border yesterday. They believe it's headed to a safe house in Patterson,  New Jersey, and the FBI thinks they can apprehend him in 24 hours. Of course, the only  way all of this will happen is if Reda Nessam is telling the truth, so who wants odds?  Anyway, they're still looking at forensic evidence and we're going to talk again in a  few minutes to decide if there's a credible threat.",west_wing
7574,bartlet,"I said, we're going to decide if there's a credible threat. Why? What are you guys  talking about?",west_wing
7597,bartlet, I know. I can’t believe we’re all still here.,west_wing
7598,bartlet,The episode was over. Leo was with me. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs was with me as  were the Secretaries of State and Defense. ,west_wing
7601,bartlet,I get injections of Betaseron.,west_wing
7603,bartlet,I think it would be best while temperatures are running a little high that you refer to my  wife as Mrs. Bartlet or the First Lady.,west_wing
7604,bartlet,Talk me through what heightened security means.,west_wing
7605,bartlet,"Okay, they want a few minutes?",west_wing
7606,bartlet, Toby’s concerned that the peaceful solution I brokered in Kashmir last year  was the result of a drug-induced haze.,west_wing
7609,bartlet,"I was elected, they were appointed.  The Vice President was elected.  He has the constitutional authority to assume my...",west_wing
7611,bartlet,"That’s because I never signed the letter, but I don’t think I got shot because I got MS.",west_wing
7616,bartlet,And the walls came tumbling down. I feel fine by the way. Thanks for asking.,west_wing
7617,bartlet," No, Leo. Toby’s concern for my health is moving me in ways...",west_wing
7618,bartlet, You know your indignation would be a lot more interesting to me if it  weren’t quite so covered in crap! ,west_wing
7619,bartlet, Are you pissed because I didn’t say anything or are you pissed because there  were 15 people who knew before you did? I feel fine by the way. Thanks for asking.,west_wing
7620,bartlet," Yeah, this is the President.",west_wing
7658,bartlet,Charlie!  I’ve got to make the call.,west_wing
7659,bartlet,Let’s get Garreth back.,west_wing
7660,bartlet,The scanners they use take an hour to search the luggage of 250 passengers. The condition  requires two photo IDs. Most people only have one. Delays. Delays are the downside.,west_wing
7661,bartlet," I have no intention of apologizing to you, Toby.",west_wing
7663,bartlet,"‘Cause you’re not the one with MS, a wife, three kids and airports to close. Not every  part of me belongs to you. This was personal. I’m not willing to relinquish that right.",west_wing
7666,bartlet,"Well, that’s what usually brings on the episodes, but if you say so.",west_wing
7669,bartlet,I don’t know.  It may have been unbelievably stupid. It may have  been unthinkably stupid. I don’t know. ,west_wing
7670,bartlet,I’m sorry. I really am.,west_wing
7672,bartlet,Yeah. I’ll see you tomorrow. Thanks.,west_wing
7674,bartlet,"I couldn't disagree more, Cal. As long as these people are funding their public school  districts with property taxes, neither the value of the schools nor the value of their  property is going to go up. It's a vicious circle. It's terrible and it has to be stopped. ",west_wing
7675,bartlet,I wouldn't go that far. Anything else? ,west_wing
7676,bartlet,"It's a vicious circle, Leo. ",west_wing
7677,bartlet,It just goes round and round... ,west_wing
7678,bartlet,...and round and round. ,west_wing
7679,bartlet,We really need to see him now? ,west_wing
7680,bartlet,"Five White House Counsels in two and a half years. Cochran, Gates, Solomon, Tribbey.  Why can't I keep a head lawyer around here? ",west_wing
7681,bartlet,I don't like new people. ,west_wing
7682,bartlet,"Never played chess, though, have we? ",west_wing
7683,bartlet,"What is it with people from Chicago that they're so happy to have been born there?  I meet so many people who can't wait to tell me they're from Chicago, and when I  meet them, they're living anywhere but Chicago. ",west_wing
7684,bartlet,He looks down his nose at me 'cause I'm not a lawyer. ,west_wing
7685,bartlet,I didn't go to law school. I got a Ph.D. in economics instead. ,west_wing
7686,bartlet,"Yeah, and all that happened was I won a Nobel Prize and got elected President so I guess  that decision didn't really pay off. ",west_wing
7687,bartlet,Should I run back and get my Nobel Prize? ,west_wing
7688,bartlet,Guy's been here three months he's got a nicer office than I do. ,west_wing
7689,bartlet,That matters less to me. ,west_wing
7690,bartlet,What are the bags for? ,west_wing
7691,bartlet,"Oh... oh, gosh. Oliver, this... ",west_wing
7692,bartlet,The man's bags are packed. Where are you going? ,west_wing
7693,bartlet,Asia's best-kept secret. ,west_wing
7694,bartlet,It's really not even... I don't want you to worry that much about it. ,west_wing
7695,bartlet,"Well, Oliver, it really boils down to this I'm going to tell you a story and then  I need you to tell me whether or not I've engaged 16 people in a massive criminal  conspiracy to defraud the public in order to win a Presidential election. ",west_wing
7731,bartlet,Not as much as a doctor. You should talk to a doctor. ,west_wing
7732,bartlet,"I think what you're asking is, is it possible I could be sitting in the Situation Room,  have an attack, and nobody knows it. ",west_wing
7733,bartlet,Yes. My vision might get blurry. You wouldn't know that. My legs might get numb...,west_wing
7734,bartlet, What's he talking about? ,west_wing
7735,bartlet,I don't want to be careful about what I say in this room. ,west_wing
7736,bartlet,"I want you. I meant, I don't need to be careful. ",west_wing
7737,bartlet,Have I ever been party to a lawsuit? ,west_wing
7738,bartlet,I was governor of New Hampshire. Anybody who... ,west_wing
7739,bartlet, A meter reader slipped on a patch of black ice in my driveway and I got  dragged into some pain-in-the-ass thing over my great-aunt's will. ,west_wing
7740,bartlet,"Oliver, why are we talking about my great-aunt's will and the meter reader? ",west_wing
7741,bartlet,"Well, the Mexican economy crashed, an oil tanker busted up about 120 miles from here and  13 percent of Americans are living in poverty. So yeah, I can hang out with you and  answer insulting questions for awhile. ",west_wing
7775,bartlet,"I have accidental death insurance as well as considerable personal worth. Were I to die,  my family would not miss my government salary. ",west_wing
7776,bartlet,I don't have any anymore. ,west_wing
7777,bartlet,"I'm the husband of a doctor and as a Governor and President, the various governments  I've led generously... ",west_wing
7816,bartlet,Sit down. Don't be scared. ,west_wing
7817,bartlet,My youngest daughter's got a big mouth. ,west_wing
7818,bartlet,"We won't discuss this any more for the time being. It'll be public soon enough. And the  more conversations you have with me, the more lawyers you're gonna have to talk to, and  they bill in an hour what you take home in a week, so we won't discuss it except to say  this. You're gonna be subpoenaed. I'm confident in your loyalty to me. I'm confident in  your love for me. If you lie to protect me, if you lie just once, if you lie just a  little, if you lie 'cause you can't stand what's happening to me and the people making  it happen, if you ever, ever lie... ",west_wing
7819,bartlet,"...you're finished with me, you understand? ",west_wing
7820,bartlet, I need you to go to law school and graduate as soon as humanly possible. ,west_wing
7821,bartlet,"Well, I've got good news for you, Oliver. Turns out I didn't do everything right after  all. Zoey had to fill out a family history form for Georgetown and because she was 17,  a parent had to sign it.",west_wing
7822,bartlet,"I'd give anything if I had. It was Lady Macbeth.  There's a bad moon rising,  Oliver. We both know it. They're gonna take me out for a walk. ",west_wing
7823,bartlet,"This isn't what you signed up for. Leo begged you to take this job. This isn't what you  signed up for. If you leave, I'd appreciate it if you did it now, so it doesn't look  like my lawyer bailed on me when the rain starts. No one's gonna hold it against you. ",west_wing
7824,bartlet,What would my first step be? ,west_wing
7901,bartlet,"When Leo talked to you on the plane, he thought you already knew.",west_wing
7902,bartlet,"And I’m saying, we still do this. We’re husband and wife and parents, and before we  launch into palace intrigue, we do, ""Welcome back. How was the flight?""",west_wing
7903,bartlet,One of the forms Zoey had to fill out for Georgetown asked for a family medical history.,west_wing
7904,bartlet,Did Leo tell you the rest?,west_wing
7905,bartlet,Zoey wasn’t 18 yet when she started. A parent had to sign the form.,west_wing
7906,bartlet,"No, you did, Hot Pants.",west_wing
7907,bartlet,I talked to Zoey this morning. She’s gonna ace her finals.,west_wing
7908,bartlet,I hate Ellie’s boyfriend.,west_wing
7909,bartlet,"I need you to speak to the White House Counsel, Abbey.",west_wing
7946,bartlet,"Leo, how could you tell Abbey about the health form before I did?",west_wing
7947,bartlet,"My wife and I are fighting battles on several fronts at the moment, including one with  each other. Can you and I be men? Can we have a bond?",west_wing
7948,bartlet,How's he gonna feel about that?,west_wing
7949,bartlet,"I'm coming clean, I'm doing it voluntarily. Anyone finds out, it's going to look like  I did it because a poll told me to.",west_wing
7950,bartlet, Why don't you get Sam?,west_wing
7968,bartlet,He talked to her on the phone?,west_wing
7969,bartlet,But he called her on the phone?,west_wing
7970,bartlet,"Yeah, but I'm saying, did she hang up the phone, turn to her friends and say, 'You're  never gonna believe why I'm getting on a plane?'",west_wing
7971,bartlet,You like the way it looks if we're meeting in the basement?,west_wing
7976,bartlet,Excuse me. How many people in this room know Kenny's last name? ,west_wing
7977,bartlet,I believe this operation is no longer covert.,west_wing
7978,bartlet,"Joey, is there any good news in there at all?",west_wing
7979,bartlet, What happened last night?,west_wing
7980,bartlet,Where is the president-elect?,west_wing
7981,bartlet,And that's not the most troubling...,west_wing
7982,bartlet,"At the moment, there is no Dessaline government; there is no Dessaline! And I just got  done pulling nine dead bodies out of Colombia. Evacuate the non-essentials. Get some  Marines at the Embassy. And somebody brief Fitzwallace!",west_wing
8004,bartlet,What is Peter Bratt doing down there?,west_wing
8005,bartlet,In the trunk of his car?,west_wing
8006,bartlet,Did we evacuate the non-essentials?,west_wing
8054,bartlet,They boarded the plane?,west_wing
8055,bartlet,That wasn't supposed to happen!,west_wing
8056,bartlet,I evacuated the non-essentials specifically so that wouldn't happen!,west_wing
8057,bartlet,I gave the order six hours ago!,west_wing
8058,bartlet, Six hours ago I gave the order! What the hell were they still doing  on the runway?!,west_wing
8059,bartlet,And I'm sure these guys had their handbooks with them!,west_wing
8060,bartlet,The plane is up in the air?,west_wing
8061,bartlet,What's happening on the ground?,west_wing
8062,bartlet,And what does Bazan want?,west_wing
8063,bartlet,"You're right, you know, I should be bringing them in on reelection. I should be talking  to them.",west_wing
8064,bartlet,I don't want to make the same mistakes over again.,west_wing
8065,bartlet,Yeah. Let's start tonight. Around nine o'clock we'll meet in the residence.,west_wing
8066,bartlet,Never... You bought a new car?,west_wing
8067,bartlet,And you paid sticker price.,west_wing
8068,bartlet,"You need to look at the next page - subsection B, paragraph four, Mamie Yokum.",west_wing
8069,bartlet,Secret Service'd have you down like a calf at a rodeo.,west_wing
8070,bartlet," ""The definition of 'gift' excludes opportunities and benefits including favorable  rates and commercial discounts available to the public at large.""",west_wing
8071,bartlet, Is the reason you didn't tell me you were getting a new car... you...?  Did you think I was gonna think it was an extravagance?,west_wing
8072,bartlet,"You don't think I think you should have a new car?  Delores, have you ever had  a new car?",west_wing
8073,bartlet,How about you let me find out what you were supposed to pay and write you a check for  the difference?,west_wing
8074,bartlet,It's the smell of freedom... and the chemicals they treat the dashboard with.,west_wing
8075,bartlet,When are you picking it up?,west_wing
8076,bartlet,"Do me a favor, would you? Come back here after you pick it up. I'd like to talk to you  about something.",west_wing
8077,bartlet,And put the car in the driveway. I'd like to kick the tires.,west_wing
8078,bartlet," It's an expression, Fannie Mae! Go get your car!",west_wing
8130,bartlet,Okay. Send Fitzwallace down. Anything else?,west_wing
8131,bartlet,They've been in there 48 hours.,west_wing
8132,bartlet,The guy's been President of his country for two days. He's spent them both at gunpoint.,west_wing
8133,bartlet,What do you know about this storm?,west_wing
8134,bartlet,It's moving from Florida to South Carolina.,west_wing
8135,bartlet,"No, I mean it's been designated a tropical storm. That means it has a surface wind  speed of something.",west_wing
8136,bartlet,Isn't it strange to have a tropical storm in May?,west_wing
8137,bartlet,I'm pretty sure there's a season and this isn't it.,west_wing
8138,bartlet,I mean it's not a big deal. It's just that I'm pretty sure it's strange.,west_wing
8139,bartlet,You ever been to National Cathedral?,west_wing
8140,bartlet,You know you could lay the Washington Monument down on its side in that church?,west_wing
8148,bartlet,Do you have any idea why the door to the portico keeps swinging open? It's a little  annoying.,west_wing
8149,bartlet, But the door opens out.,west_wing
8150,bartlet,Charlie says there's a wind tunnel created by something. They're fixing the latch.,west_wing
8151,bartlet,"Okay. Well, we've got to go. I don't know what to say. Leo's pretty rich. Maybe he can  buy some tech stocks and jack up the price.",west_wing

9883,bartlet,"I've gotta tell him I lost a submarine. Can I make something up, like ""say, a friend of  mine hypothetically...""",west_wing
9884,bartlet,Bring a copy of the constitution. I'm gonna show him I'm not scared.,west_wing
9885,bartlet,"Hey, Bruno, can you devise a campaign strategy that involves beating the crap out of Leo?",west_wing
9905,bartlet,Every single election...,west_wing
9906,bartlet,"Legislature, house, governor. ",west_wing
9907,bartlet,Okay. It's a profound statement about democracy. ,west_wing
9908,bartlet,Can I get you anything? ,west_wing
9909,bartlet,"Okay. Okay. I've asked you here, Albie, because you're the assistant Secretary of State and I,  of course, am the President. ",west_wing
9910,bartlet,"Thanks, Albie. That much, the National Security Council has made clear to me. ",west_wing
9911,bartlet,"And if they were in trouble, you see, they wouldn't send a distress signal 'cause they might  be detected and submariners have a different set of criteria when assessing risk versus reward. ",west_wing
9912,bartlet,"Okay, I'll just stand over there. ",west_wing
9913,bartlet,"Cause for war. Little thing called Latin. Albie, if we tell North Korea we've violated their  waters it could be interpreted as an act of war? ",west_wing
9914,bartlet,Okay.  Can I talk to you alone for a second? ,west_wing
9915,bartlet,Let's not call North Korea just yet. ,west_wing
9916,bartlet,Leo. Gut feeling. Has the boat gone quiet? ,west_wing
9917,bartlet,All right. Three more hours. ,west_wing
9918,bartlet,"Also, he'd be good to have around for morale, 'cause he's Mr. Happy Fun Guy. ",west_wing
9919,bartlet,Albie. I'm gonna ask you to stay around for a while. ,west_wing
9920,bartlet,"Charlie, could you have someone bring some Schweppes' Bitter Lemon and the Constitutional  Order of Succession, please? ",west_wing
9939,bartlet,"Oh, God, I'm sorry, am I still here? ",west_wing
9940,bartlet,"I haven't lost the boat yet, Mr. Secretary, and I happen to be the only one in the building  who thinks we should be sending the fast attack subs right now. And I'm an hour from  gathering the NSC and calling Japan. ",west_wing
9941,bartlet,"There was a UN action, Mr. Secretary. Sixteen countries were involved in that police action,  Mr. Secretary. Thirty-three, thirty-four thousand American dead. How come we're the only ones  still fighting? Where did everybody go? ",west_wing
9944,bartlet,"No, give it to me now. I want a distraction. ",west_wing
9970,bartlet,Yeah. We're going now. ,west_wing
9971,bartlet,What happened? Did you contact Pac fleet? ,west_wing
9972,bartlet,How many trips will it take? ,west_wing
9973,bartlet,Let's go get 'em. Time's up. ,west_wing
9974,bartlet,"All right, okay. There they are. See, they went deep and quiet to avoid a close-aboard with  a Luna class destroyer. What you gotta do in these situations is you trust the captain,  you trust the crew. ",west_wing
9975,bartlet,So I'm on the ballot in New Hampshire. ,west_wing
9976,bartlet,Okay.  When Romans ran for the office of Counsel - did I just see you roll your eyes? ,west_wing
9977,bartlet,"They wore whitened togas to show their intent - a bit silly, perhaps... ",west_wing
9978,bartlet,But it was an act of personal commission. ,west_wing
9979,bartlet,You're pretty mouthy today. ,west_wing
9981,bartlet,Hey. Do you duck when you're getting on Marine One? ,west_wing
9982,bartlet,I think the blades are high enough. ,west_wing
9984,bartlet,"Yeah, listen. I want you to go easy on him. He's a conscientious and dedicated guy.  It's not an easy question. ",west_wing
9985,bartlet,Why do I want to be President? ,west_wing
9986,bartlet, I've been thinking about it for the last couple of hours. I almost had it.,west_wing
9987,bartlet,I'm not wild about Camp David.,west_wing
9988,bartlet,"I'm not the only one, either. Bess Truman didn't like it. I read that somewhere.  She thought it was dull.  But there I go, Thanksgiving at Camp David.",west_wing
9989,bartlet," It's not a place you go at Thanksgiving, not when you have a farm.",west_wing
9991,bartlet,What makes you think it's a farm?,west_wing
9993,bartlet,"Farms have things you can grow, and animals.",west_wing
9994,bartlet,I want you to learn more about farms.,west_wing
9995,bartlet,"Doesn't matter. Thanksgiving's where your family is, and this year my family's at  Camp David. Why, I do not know. Abbey didn't wanna schlepp to New Hampshire.  Schlepping in a 747. It's not like we were gonna have to carry our own bags or  anything, but I do not argue. ",west_wing
9996,bartlet,Were we talking about something?,west_wing
9998,bartlet, You know that line you're not supposed to cross with the President?,west_wing
9999,bartlet,No-no. Look behind you.,west_wing
10000,bartlet,Would you like to leave?,west_wing
10002,bartlet,"Damn right, with my permission. ",west_wing
10003,bartlet,"It's the brine that keeps the meat soft, lady. You soak it overnight in water, salt, sugar...",west_wing
10004,bartlet,Seventeen kinds of spices including?,west_wing
10059,bartlet,"Bess Truman didn't like Camp David, either, she thought it was dull. Doesn't matter.",west_wing
10060,bartlet,"Long as you've got an oven, and you go to three hundred and twenty degrees. You take your  turkey, which has been soaking overnight in water, salt, coriander...",west_wing
10062,bartlet,This is some sort of pre-emptive psychological thing?,west_wing
10063,bartlet,That's not going to work.,west_wing
10065,bartlet,I saw the message calendar. I'm having some difficulty navigating the color-coding.,west_wing
10067,bartlet,"Well, there should be a separate color for things I don't care about.",west_wing
10068,bartlet,Providing low-cost cell phone service to neighborhood watch groups.,west_wing
10070,bartlet,"There's nothing wrong with the policy, it's just too small. I could fund this initiative  out of my pocket.",west_wing
10072,bartlet,"Leo could fund it out of his pocket. Shouldn't this be local government, like the YMCA  or something?",west_wing
10074,bartlet,"We pass minute, but easy to understand.",west_wing
10075,bartlet,Bring me that polling data.,west_wing
10077,bartlet,"Cornbread, oysters, water chestnuts, andouille sausage.",west_wing
10082,bartlet,I've got it covered. Anything else?,west_wing
10084,bartlet,I know they're coming out. What's it going to look like?,west_wing
10087,bartlet,"...carroway seeds, thyme, cornbread, oysters, water chestnuts and Handui sausage.",west_wing
10088,bartlet,"Yeah. But Toby seemed to indicate that you have to be careful if you cook it inside the  turkey, because in some cases it doesn't cook, and when that happens, people get sick.",west_wing
10089,bartlet, 'Cause I thought Toby might be playing with me.,west_wing
10090,bartlet,But you said you've heard of it.,west_wing
10091,bartlet,"Nah, you don't have that kind of wit.",west_wing
10092,bartlet,I need to talk to an expert.,west_wing
10093,bartlet,"No. No, I can't. Thanks Margaret. ",west_wing
10094,bartlet,I can't ask Rene right now.,west_wing
10095,bartlet,"Well, frankly, I thought he did something stupid and inconsiderate last week, but it  turns out I was just in a bad mood.",west_wing
10096,bartlet,"Yes. And while he didn't deserve it, he will someday soon. ",west_wing
10097,bartlet,82 percent are in favor of fixing potholes?,west_wing
10098,bartlet,I'm gonna look at this.,west_wing
10099,bartlet,"They want the nickel and dime stuff, I'll tell you one thing we can do.",west_wing
10100,bartlet,This time of the year there should be a hotline you can call with questions about cooking  turkey. A special 800 number where the phones are staffed by experts.,west_wing
10101,bartlet, Butterball has a hotline?,west_wing
10102,bartlet,"God, I'm sorry, I love my country. Charlie, get me the number for the Butterball hotline.",west_wing
10103,bartlet,I don't think this is the right one.,west_wing
10104,bartlet,"Yeah, this is something different. Hang on a second. This is--  Find Bruno Gianelli, tell him I wanna see him right away.",west_wing
10135,bartlet,What the hell is this? ,west_wing
10136,bartlet, It's a poll. I asked to see a poll about certain...  doesn't matter. Then send up the wrong poll. This one asks voters where I should spend  Thanksgiving.,west_wing
10137,bartlet,What the hell are you doing polling where I should spend Thanksgiving?,west_wing
10138,bartlet,I have Thanksgiving with my family.,west_wing
10139,bartlet,You politicize family to make sure they don't look political.,west_wing
10140,bartlet,My family is off limits. ,west_wing
10141,bartlet,"I'll decide when I've used them up. You don't poll where my family goes, am I making myself clear?",west_wing
10142,bartlet,"Ah, something important!",west_wing
10143,bartlet,"The number for the Butterball Hotline.  Watch, and learn.",west_wing
10150,bartlet,You polled where I should have Thanksgiving?,west_wing
10152,bartlet,And it was okay with you?,west_wing
10154,bartlet,You think people should care where I have Thanksgiving?,west_wing
10156,bartlet,All right. Doesn't matter. I straightened it out. It has a lot to do with kelp.,west_wing
10157,bartlet,"Well, first let me say, I think this is a wonderful service you provide.",west_wing
10158,bartlet," I'm Joe Betherson...sen. That's one 't', and with an 'h' in there.",west_wing
10159,bartlet," My street address is 114... 54 Pruder Street, and it's very important  that you put 'street' down there because sometimes it gets confused with Pruder Way and  Pruder Lane. Apartment 23 R... Fargo, North Dakota... ",west_wing
10160,bartlet,I do radio commercials for... products.,west_wing
10161,bartlet," Stuffing should be stuffed inside the turkey, am I correct?",west_wing
10162,bartlet,"Well, then we'd have to call it something else, wouldn't we?Toby sits down and puts his  hand under his chin.",west_wing
10163,bartlet,"If I cook it inside the turkey, is there a chance I could kill my guests? I'm not saying  that's necessarily a deal-breaker.",west_wing
10164,bartlet,"All right. Well, first of all, I think you made the second bacteria up, and second of all,  how do I avoid it?",west_wing
10165,bartlet,Excellent! Let's talk temperature.,west_wing
10166,bartlet,"No, see, I was testing you! The USDA calls for turkeys to be cooked to an internal temperature  of 180 to 185 degrees.",west_wing
10167,bartlet,Oh yeah. It was presented to me as a gift from the personal sous chef to the king of...   auto sales in... ,west_wing
10168,bartlet,"Fargo. Phil Baharnd. The man can sell a car like... well, like anything.",west_wing
10169,bartlet,"And you do, too. Thanks a lot!  That was excellent!  We should do that once a week.",west_wing
10170,bartlet,I gotta get better at the names.,west_wing
10171,bartlet,"No. One more thing left. Today, we find the traitor in my family. I know the First Lady  doesn't like to schlep, but would you please tell her to meet me in the residence?",west_wing
10202,bartlet,"Yeah, sorry about that. Listen, I'm sorry about this, too, but we have to change plans.",west_wing
10203,bartlet,We're gonna have dinner here at the White House. Charlie's calling everybody.,west_wing
10204,bartlet,I've got polling numbers.,west_wing
10205,bartlet,"J'accuse, mon petite fromage!",west_wing
10206,bartlet,Nothing's wrong with my French.,west_wing
10207,bartlet,And what part are you leaving out now?,west_wing
10208,bartlet, You know what? It was.,west_wing
10209,bartlet,"Well, with the ingredients for stuffing, you have to cook them before you put them in the  turkey, and you're not gonna know whether I did or not.",west_wing
10236,bartlet,"Come with me for a second, would you?",west_wing
10238,bartlet,No problem. Are you straightening things out with the Smithsonian?,west_wing
10239,bartlet,"I'm supposed to speak at the opening of an exhibit marking the sixtieth anniversary  of Pearl Harbor, but there's a small veterans' group that objects to the exhibit on  the grounds that it's America bashing.",west_wing
10242,bartlet,The point is that we've dotted the I's and we're ready to announce.,west_wing
10243,bartlet,Let C.J. know but have her pass it off to the DoD.,west_wing
10245,bartlet,"I don't know, every time we make one of these deals with a place like Qumar I feel  the women around here look at me funny.",west_wing
10247,bartlet,You think it's just guilt?,west_wing
10248,bartlet,Well how should I deal with guilt?,west_wing
10249,bartlet,"C.J.'s going to be cool with this, right?",west_wing
10251,bartlet,"I'm just saying she knows who the good guys are, right?",west_wing
10280,bartlet,Did the Celtics win last night?,west_wing
10281,bartlet,"Okay, when I say did they win, you can just say yes or no.",west_wing
10282,bartlet,"I'm not on you, I'm just asking.",west_wing
10283,bartlet,Modern American history sucks.,west_wing
10284,bartlet,"You want to study history, study the Crusades, the fall of the Roman Empire from  Theoddoseus to Justinian.",west_wing
10285,bartlet,Damn right the Visigoths. Modern history's another name for television.,west_wing
10286,bartlet,Is there any way I can help?,west_wing
10287,bartlet,"I'm a master of modern history, you can ask me anything.",west_wing
10288,bartlet,They said you needed to see me.,west_wing
10290,bartlet,"Oh man, they got it again?",west_wing
10291,bartlet,Do we say anything in the meantime?,west_wing
10295,bartlet,"The second we say positive, beef futures collapse, and we lose 3.6 billion in beef exports.  Fast food is deserted, supermarkets pull beef, it's panic - I want to talk to some more  people, but in the meantime, we wait.",west_wing
10352,bartlet, All right. Unfunded mandates.,west_wing
10353,bartlet,Don't give me their grumbles.,west_wing
10354,bartlet,Are employees in wheelchairs supposed to work in the parking lot?,west_wing
10355,bartlet,How much would it cost the federal government to amend the unfunded mandates we format  to cover all unfunded mandates?,west_wing
10356,bartlet,Let's find out for sure then tell Siegel to sit down and shut up.,west_wing
10357,bartlet,"So paint a picture for me, would you?",west_wing
10358,bartlet,That's the live cattle. What about the beef?,west_wing
10359,bartlet,That's a hundred and fifty billion dollar industry. What's the West going to do for a living?,west_wing
10360,bartlet,People have known about this disease; they're still eating beef in record numbers.,west_wing
10361,bartlet,"And then the corn and soybean growers, right?",west_wing
10362,bartlet,"So we've got frightened parents, rising food prices, public panic, massive layoffs,  and something we've never had to worry about before, we're wondering when the next  case is gonna happen. The most costly disruptions...",west_wing
10363,bartlet,Always happen when something we take completely for granted stops working for a minute.,west_wing
10364,bartlet,"Oh, hey - do you know when we passed the Clean Water Act?",west_wing
10365,bartlet,How could you not know that?,west_wing
10366,bartlet,History can't be reduced to dates and names.,west_wing
10367,bartlet,"Nah. I'm starting you out with a copy of the speech George Perkins March used in 1845  to rouse the agricultural community of Rutland, Vermont. Then you're going to need to  study on the word ""ecology,"" as coined by the German biologist Ernst Heikl.",west_wing
10368,bartlet," Better in the original German, of course, but obviously the  translation will be fine.",west_wing
10400,bartlet,You really wanna talk about the lawsuit in Colorado?,west_wing
10401,bartlet,"You hear about the lawyer who opened a chain of dry cleaners? ""Press your lawsuit while  you wait?""  There was a better joke in there someplace, right?",west_wing
10402,bartlet,Doctrine of Sovereign Immunity. You can't sue the king. We brought it over from England.,west_wing
10403,bartlet,Forgot to bring that one over.,west_wing
10404,bartlet,The RNC has a press conference when I sneeze.,west_wing
10405,bartlet,Congress won't pass it.,west_wing
10406,bartlet,"People know where I stand. If they don't know, they can ask me.",west_wing
10407,bartlet,"And I was for it then. Never did anything about it because nobody wanted it. And, frankly,  why waste time in Capitol?",west_wing
10408,bartlet,I can't be responsible every time somebody irrationally twists my meaning. People are  responsible for themselves. ,west_wing
10409,bartlet,"Today's cars are safer than they've ever been. They've all got air bags, they've all got  seatbelts, and they're all crash tested from here to Tuesday. All that's left is personal  behavior and bad luck, and, I'm not responsible for either one. And, Sam, if Mrs. Landingham w as here right now, she'd say the exact same thing. You know what I'm saying?",west_wing
10410,bartlet,"I don't blame this woman for suing me. I'm not a king, and I'm not sure the law should  treat me like one. Though certainly for the moment I don't mind. I'm not blaming her.  She's got to go someplace with her grief and her anger. The ones who should be horsewhipped  with a horsewhip are the ones exploiting her grief for political gain, and I'm not getting  down with those guys.",west_wing
10411,bartlet, Let Congress pass that law. I'll sign it.,west_wing
10412,bartlet," Yeah, let's go. Get Leo.",west_wing
10414,bartlet,Isn't there a joke to be had with lawsuits and dry cleaners? I've been working on it all day.,west_wing
10416,bartlet,"Okay, what do we think? When do you tell the public what you know?",west_wing
10424,bartlet, Something going on with them?,west_wing
10426,bartlet, If it comes from the President--,west_wing
10429,bartlet,"All right, that's what we'll do then.",west_wing
10430,bartlet,What's going on with the Smithsonian?,west_wing
10431,bartlet,Where are you leading them?,west_wing
10435,bartlet,"Ah, Toby. We've gotta straighten out Medicaid.",west_wing
10436,bartlet,"You know, after the Civil War, veterans had to come to D.C. to get their pensions? They had  to visit the office personally. They waited for a clerk to look through all the Civil War  records until their papers were found. You know what their papers were bound with?",west_wing
10437,bartlet,Red tape. That's where it comes from.,west_wing
10438,bartlet,Go and apologize to C.J. for whatever you did. ,west_wing
10439,bartlet,"It was interesting, but what?",west_wing
10440,bartlet,"Hey, I forgot. Get the information from Toby, I'll make the call myself.",west_wing
10441,bartlet,Get the information. Get the director of the CMSO on the phone.,west_wing
10442,bartlet,Is when we passed the Clean Water Act.,west_wing
10443,bartlet,You know nothing about the Visigoths.,west_wing
10478,bartlet," Listen, I don't care that much about your ass but if you need to perjure  yourself to protect me you're going to damn well do it. ",west_wing
10479,bartlet,"Whatever it is Josh does, you're going to let him do it. ",west_wing
10480,bartlet,"Yeah, yeah. How does she look to you? ",west_wing
10481,bartlet,I like you and her. It's like a '50s screwball comedy ,west_wing
10482,bartlet,I'm not doing anything tomorrow night. ,west_wing
10483,bartlet,"Yeah. Actually, nobody does. ",west_wing
10484,bartlet,You got about a thousand people in this building standing with you right now. ,west_wing
10485,bartlet,"Thomas Hilton started a fishing village here in 1623, Allen. ",west_wing
10486,bartlet,And a slogan's going to do that? ,west_wing
10487,bartlet,"Oh, oh, slow down, you're going too fast. ",west_wing
10488,bartlet,$367 million in snowmobiling? ,west_wing
10489,bartlet, And the goggles... That includes the goggles? ,west_wing
10490,bartlet,"Okay. Thanks, guys.  Mrs. Landingham! Thanks. ",west_wing
10491,bartlet,Speaking of crusty New England relics...,west_wing
10492,bartlet,Nah. Abbey wants to eat at Patsy's tonight. Would you let them know we're coming? ,west_wing
10493,bartlet,Jenny and Mallory are okay? ,west_wing
10494,bartlet,What are you doing here? ,west_wing
10495,bartlet,What are you doing...? ,west_wing
10496,bartlet,Where are you staying? ,west_wing
10497,bartlet,What do you want to talk to me about? ,west_wing
10498,bartlet,"I think that's great, man. I think it's about time. You probably mean the House, but I  think you should consider the Senate seat in Illinois in two years; I can help raise money. ",west_wing
10499,bartlet,"Hey, Leo, I swear to God there's no one I'd rather see in the Oval Office than you but  if you run there's going to be a lot of discussion about Valium and Alcohol. I mean,  it's going to come out; this is the world. ",west_wing
10500,bartlet,"What? Leo takes a napkin out of his pocket, licks it, and sticks it on the posterboard  easel. It reads ""Bartlet for America."" ",west_wing
10504,bartlet,"Well, the phone calls have been coming all morning, Governor. You should know that Algiss  Skyler called. ",west_wing
10505,bartlet,Skyler wants to know why the hell you haven't. ,west_wing
10506,bartlet,Was Eisenhower wrong in '57? Kennedy in '61? ,west_wing
10507,bartlet,"We don't know what the situation is, do we, Josh? ",west_wing
10509,bartlet,"Do we know what's going on, Agent Casper? ",west_wing
10510,bartlet,"Edward, so far the churches have been empty. There have been no fatalities. But tomorrow  night's Christmas Eve. They're going to be packed. So why shouldn't I send troops in? ",west_wing
10511,bartlet,This doesn't happen in New Hampshire. ,west_wing
10512,bartlet,"We'll meet again this afternoon. Thank you, Governor. ",west_wing
10513,bartlet,"So, what have you got cooking? ",west_wing
10514,bartlet,"I said, what have you got cooking? ",west_wing
10515,bartlet,"Yes, you do. I know what happened at the third debate. He told me. I know what's going to  happen this afternoon. What are you going to do? Are you going to try and get Gibson out  of the room when it's his turn to question? ",west_wing
10517,bartlet,"Abbey's about to get spanked. Guys, the things we do to women. My wife's a world-class  scientist. ",west_wing

10525,bartlet,"Yeah, we're lookin' past that.",west_wing
10526,bartlet,Full financial disclosure...,west_wing
10527,bartlet,They want me to take a physical. ,west_wing
10528,bartlet,What's a physical right now gonna show?,west_wing
10529,bartlet," I'm not lying to anybody, Abbey. I'm taking a physical - a physical which  I'm under no legal obligation to take. I'm doing it voluntarily.",west_wing
10530,bartlet,"Now is when people are listening. I'll make my speeches, get whooped on Super Tuesday,  and we'll all go home.",west_wing
10531,bartlet, The things we do to women.,west_wing
10537,bartlet," All right, let's do it.",west_wing
10538,bartlet,I'd like you to be the Vice-President.,west_wing
10539,bartlet,"Why don't you sit with Abbey and me for a few minutes.  Can I have the  room, please?",west_wing
10540,bartlet, You want anything? Coffee or anything?,west_wing
10541,bartlet,You ran a good campaign.  You're a young man. You'll be back.,west_wing
10542,bartlet,"There's something you need to know. It's why I asked everyone to leave the room.   A few years ago, I was diagnosed with a relapsing remitting course of MS.",west_wing
10543,bartlet,I told you because it's something you're gonna need to know. But also because I wanted to show  that I trust you.,west_wing
10544,bartlet," Well, what do you say?",west_wing
10545,bartlet," I'd like your answer now, John.",west_wing
10546,bartlet,I'm gonna stretch my legs.,west_wing
10555,bartlet,"All right. Here come the Tennessee Volunteers. Reverend, have the pastors encourage the  women to bake those guys something nice. They're all spending Christmas Eve where they  don't want to be. Ed, you get to be a hero to the blacks in your state. Anybody in your  state doesn't like it the FBI is calling the shots. What could you do? Anything else? ",west_wing
10556,bartlet,I'm sorry. I've forgotten your name. ,west_wing
10557,bartlet,A two-year investigation gets its first crack from a broken taillight.,west_wing
10558,bartlet,"God, well, some of the stupidest criminals in the world are working right here in America.  I've always been very proud of that. ",west_wing
10559,bartlet,"Thank you, Agent Casper. ",west_wing
10561,bartlet,It's not going to happen? ,west_wing
10562,bartlet,"It was a long shot, anyway. Look, I wanted to see him spared this but Leo's made out of  leather. His face has a map of the world on it. Leo comes back. ",west_wing
10564,bartlet," It won't be later. This is a 550 seat theater and they'll be seated a  half-hour before we start, so the temperature'll be up four to six degrees.",west_wing
10577,bartlet, Which is more than I can say for me in Rosslyn.,west_wing
10578,bartlet,Did you get a date with her?,west_wing
10579,bartlet,I did the church thing in Tennessee okay. I did it without you.,west_wing
10580,bartlet,"So anyway, I have a present for you.",west_wing
10581,bartlet,That was awfully nice of you.,west_wing
10630,bartlet,Weren't you going to a flea market? ,west_wing
10631,bartlet,You didn't have to do that. ,west_wing
10632,bartlet,"Look at these topographical details. Seriously, I'm going to have this framed, this is great. ",west_wing
10633,bartlet,"No, I'm going to play with it some more. ",west_wing
10634,bartlet,"Look at this map. 1709. The Dead Sea, Jordan River, Mount Sinai. ",west_wing
10635,bartlet,You want to come inside? ,west_wing
10636,bartlet,"Thanks again, Charlie. ",west_wing
10637,bartlet,They didn't offer nothing. ,west_wing
10638,bartlet,"Well, I get it but see what you can do about it, okay? ",west_wing
10639,bartlet,"No, I've got a security briefing downstairs. ",west_wing
10648,bartlet,"Good afternoon, Mr. President. ",west_wing
10649,bartlet,There seems to be a growing consensus that no one's going to believe I'm serious about  paying down a trillion dollars of the debt when I'm willing to spend $200 billion on  the child poverty fund. ,west_wing
10651,bartlet,I'm not saying we're not going to do it. We're just going to find a different way of  saying we're going to do it. ,west_wing
10652,bartlet,Thank you. What's going on? ,west_wing
10654,bartlet,Fiction or nonfiction? ,west_wing
10657,bartlet,"All right. Hey, you want to see something? Charlie gave this to me. It's a map of the  Holy Land, drawn in 1709. He got at a flea market. It's hand-colored, copper engraved.  I was going to put it in the outer office. ",west_wing
10660,bartlet,Israel wouldn't happen for another 250 years. ,west_wing
10661,bartlet,"So, what's the problem with the map? ",west_wing
10664,bartlet,"Take lunch, would you? ",west_wing
10666,bartlet,"""By God, I'm 50, alive, and the King all at the same time."" ",west_wing
10668,bartlet,"...it matters a great deal."" ",west_wing
10670,bartlet,Are you trying to tell me something? ,west_wing
10686,bartlet,I've heard about the book. ,west_wing
10689,bartlet,"When you're going to be a father you're rooting for ten fingers and ten toes, and  that's it. ",west_wing
10691,bartlet,Wait. I want to show you this great map Charlie found. ,west_wing
10694,bartlet,There was no Israel in 1709. ,west_wing
10695,bartlet,"So, it's not on the map. ",west_wing
10698,bartlet,If I put it someplace else? ,west_wing
10699,bartlet,"Leo has--in what used to be his house when he was married--a map of the United States.  The first third of it is the 13 original colonies. The second third of it is the French  territory of Louisiana. And the third third is Mexico. In this map of the United States,  there is not a single state. That's because when this map was made there was no United  States. ",west_wing
10700,bartlet,I am the President of the United States and I'm not offended by it. ,west_wing
10702,bartlet,"I'm having it enlarged and bolting it to the hood of my limo. They don't want us to  put up our map, Charlie. They're philistines in the fight for freedom but that doesn't  bother us, does it? ",west_wing
10704,bartlet,That's the key. An old map. An old map. Spin that. ,west_wing
10737,bartlet,Everybody's working late. ,west_wing
10738,bartlet,The early drafts look good. ,west_wing
10739,bartlet,"I heard. Look, I'm really not going to talk to you about my underwear. ",west_wing
10740,bartlet,"No, but I guess that doesn't mean it wasn't. ",west_wing
10741,bartlet,I don't even remember the meeting. ,west_wing
10742,bartlet,"I said, ""Why does it matter?"" ",west_wing
10768,bartlet,You want to step in for a second? ,west_wing
10769,bartlet,"Yeah. No. A little bit. Mostly, I've been talking with Babish and some of the deputies.  The Chairman, Trent, the Speaker, the Minority Leader. ",west_wing
10770,bartlet,"Yeah, I'm going to do it. ",west_wing
10771,bartlet,There's another reason. ,west_wing
10772,bartlet,"I was wrong. I was. I was just...I was wrong. Come on, you know that. Lots of times we  don't know what right or wrong is but lots of times we do and come on, this is one.  I may not have had sinister intent at the outset but there were plenty of opportunities  for me to make it right. No one in government takes responsibility for anything anymore.  We foster, we obfuscate, we rationalize. ""Everybody does it."" That's what we say. So we  come to occupy a moral safe house where everyone's to blame so no one's guilty. I'm to  blame. I was wrong. ",west_wing
10773,bartlet,"As a matter of fact, it's not a Joint Resolution. The President still has to sign a  Joint Resolution so, technically, it's a Concurrent Resolution. House Concurrent  Resolution 172. The lawyers will haggle over the wording in the next few days. So,  at least I'll make history, huh? ",west_wing
10774,bartlet,He was censured in '34. He got it expunged in '36. ,west_wing
10775,bartlet,No. Let me ask you something. You may be the last sane voice around here. ,west_wing
10776,bartlet,"In Lebanon. Not here. It's not like I'm thinking ""God, I was going to recognize Israel,  but now that I've seen this map..."" You know what? Let's just sit here quietly. ",west_wing
10829,bartlet,Abbey just went to take a phone call.,west_wing
10830,bartlet, What did you just say? ,west_wing
10831,bartlet,Right. The part I understand was Bobby saying we could cure cancer in ten years.,west_wing
10832,bartlet,"In other words, make it so that people could live with it?",west_wing
10833,bartlet,What is standing between us and that happening?,west_wing
10834,bartlet,Who at this table knows?,west_wing
10835,bartlet,How much money would it cost?,west_wing
10836,bartlet,He just said ten years. I want to hear about this from the beginning. Talk to me like  I'm not an oncologist.,west_wing
10842,bartlet,"I want to call everybody in. I just had dinner with some of Abbey's friends. They're  all oncologists. I think in the State of the Union, I can announce that I'm directing  our researchers to have a cure for cancer in ten years. Call everybody in.",west_wing
10865,bartlet,Good evening. Thanks for being here so late.,west_wing
10866,bartlet,"A President stood up. He said we will land a man on the moon before the end of the  decade. You know what we knew when he said that? Nothing. We didn't know anything.  We didn't know about the lunar surface. We didn't know how to land one of these things.  All we'd ever done is crash it into the ocean. And God knows we could figure out how to  land soft. We didn't know how to blast off again, but a President said we're gonna do it,  and we did it. So I ask you, why shouldn't I stand up and say we are going to cure  cancer in ten years?",west_wing
10871,bartlet,You think people with cancer care what my motives are? You think their families do?,west_wing
10872,bartlet,"Once again, why would somebody...?",west_wing
10873,bartlet,"I'm sorry. I know it's late, but I want to start seeing drafts of a new section in the  next few hours. C.J., I want a sense of a media overview, too.",west_wing
10874,bartlet,I just want to look at some drafts.,west_wing
10888,bartlet,We'd want to include the Society of Clinical Oncology.,west_wing
10889,bartlet,The OMB would have to score it. We haven't identified the offsets to pay for it. We can  barely tell them what the it is.,west_wing
10890,bartlet, It was a good idea though.,west_wing
10891,bartlet,So we don't get water from a rock. We just do our thing and take our chances.,west_wing
10892,bartlet, We're gonna have to do it awfully well this time.,west_wing
10893,bartlet,Somebody get these guys some pie.,west_wing
10958,bartlet,"You can check a whip count, but I don’t think we get 60 votes in a cloture motion.",west_wing
10959,bartlet,I think we lose eight Democrats once they find there is a foreign aid budget.   Anything else?,west_wing
10961,bartlet,"Look, he’s gonna make statements during the primary that force me to move to my left.  It’s not like I get a swing at every pitch, right?",west_wing
10963,bartlet,You and I know different.,west_wing
10965,bartlet,"Every candidate’s dream opponent, huh?",west_wing
10966,bartlet,I’ll take a look at what Sam does.,west_wing
10967,bartlet,I’ll take a look at it.,west_wing
10977,bartlet,Yeah. I was trying to avoid a quote.,west_wing
10979,bartlet,It’s purposely nonspecific.,west_wing
10981,bartlet,"We get the word out to our friends, but I was obviously nodding in the direction of  affirmative action.",west_wing
10983,bartlet,Nobody’s questioning where we stand.,west_wing
10984,bartlet,I don’t want to campaign today.,west_wing
10986,bartlet,"We will, but we don’t... Man, we don’t have to piss people off everyday in order to  demonstrate that we’re not...",west_wing
10987,bartlet,"Look, we’re going to Iowa where we already won. I’m not ignoring the state, and I say  thank you for getting me elected in the first place, and we’re back on the plane. And  I’ll tell you what else. I don’t think it’s a good idea for us to be fighting for news  coverage with three governors, two senators, and the head of the church of I Hate You.  Let’s just get in under the radar.",west_wing
11054,bartlet,I thought you’d gone home.,west_wing
11056,bartlet,I mean it’s gonna be Ritchie.,west_wing
11057,bartlet,"It would have been, I don’t know, it would have seemed obnoxious. It would’ve seemed  like grandstanding.  You want some bourbon?",west_wing
11059,bartlet,"Toby, if you have something to say, please say it.",west_wing
11061,bartlet, My family signed the Declaration of Independence. You think I’ve got an ethnicity  problem?,west_wing
11064,bartlet,It’s always been like that.,west_wing
11066,bartlet,You’re not telling me anything I don’t know.,west_wing
11069,bartlet,It wasn’t the moment to go.,west_wing
11071,bartlet, Do you have anything else?,west_wing
11074,bartlet,You’re gonna sing a country western song?,west_wing
11076,bartlet, This stopped being fun for me a little while ago.,west_wing
11077,bartlet,It was actually never fun for me. I was just being polite.,west_wing
11080,bartlet,I’m done being polite now.,west_wing
11082,bartlet,"Toby, it was a complicated relationship. Can I help you?",west_wing
11084,bartlet,It was a complicated relationship.,west_wing
11086,bartlet,Why are we talking about this?,west_wing
11088,bartlet,"You have stepped WAY over the line, and any other President would have your ass on the  sidewalk right now.",west_wing
11089,bartlet,"They would’ve had you on the sidewalk a long time ago.  I don’t know what the  hell goes on in a Brooklyn shrink’s office, but get it the hell out of my house!",west_wing
11109,bartlet, The speech is going out?,west_wing
11110,bartlet,I've been having trouble sleeping.,west_wing
11111,bartlet,"You understand that this is an election here, right? I mean by itself who cares?  The President's having trouble sleeping, he talks to a doctor, but with the MS and the  hearings and you're a psychiatrist...",west_wing
11112,bartlet,"Yeah, we know you. You helped Josh out last year?",west_wing
11113,bartlet,Not 'til the next morning in the middle of a national security briefing.,west_wing
11114,bartlet," Stanley, I think you're under-selling yourself when you say you're not an  expert in sleep disoders. 'Cause you've been right straight on the money so far. ",west_wing
11115,bartlet," You think if I put this out, I'm gonna fall asleep?",west_wing
11116,bartlet,"I'm sorry. Before we get to lifestyle factors, I'm just gonna turn this on. ",west_wing
11117,bartlet,When we're done writing it.,west_wing
11146,bartlet,Planes aren't allowed to fly over the White House.,west_wing
11180,bartlet,"Well, Congress was investigating me.",west_wing
11181,bartlet,And I was censured. Then I had to give the State of the Union.,west_wing
11182,bartlet,I'm running for reelection.,west_wing
11183,bartlet,"Things are blowing up everywhere, and I have chosen the General Assembly of the U.N.  to define a tougher foreign policy. Not unusually stressful, no.",west_wing
11184,bartlet,"I don't like the word ""stress"". It's a Madison Avenue word. It's something that can be  cured with flavored coffee and bath bubbles.",west_wing
11185,bartlet,"I have a job I like, and my family's healthy. ",west_wing
11186,bartlet,Stress is for other people.,west_wing
11187,bartlet,"I'm saying it's not stress. I was feeling stressed five nights ago, too and I slept fine.",west_wing
11188,bartlet,"So, what do you charge?",west_wing
11189,bartlet,"For three hundred and seventy-five dollars an hour, you ought to bring your own damn  lingerie.",west_wing
11190,bartlet,"There's a great story about Arthur Miller. ""Death of a Salesman"" had just opened on  Broadway the night before, and he was walking around his old neighborhood in Brooklyn  and he see's a hot dog vendor that he went to high school with, and he says, ""Hey, Jimmy,  it's me, Arthur Miller."" And the hot dog vendor says, ""Artie, how you doing? What you  been up to?"" And Miller says, ""I'm, you know, I'm a playwright."" And the hot dog vendor  says, ""Hmm, play writing, I should've gone into that."" Three hundred and seventy-five  dollars an hour.",west_wing
11191,bartlet,I can't sleep. I can't sleep. I'll be tired and I'll lie there and it doesn't happen.,west_wing
11192,bartlet,Say what you'd say to anyother patient.,west_wing
11193,bartlet, I had a conversation with one of m aides that night after we got back from  Iowa. He called me on something.,west_wing
11194,bartlet,"Well, I guess we talked about a lot of things. Who we think the Republican challenger is  gonna be be, and imcumbency and campaign stategy, strategic overview, but the long and  short of it is, my father never liked me at all. ",west_wing
11195,bartlet,"Yeah, I'd thought you'd enjoy that.",west_wing
11213,bartlet,What's wrong with my head?,west_wing
11214,bartlet,Of course not. That would be three hundred and eighty-five dollars an hour.,west_wing
11215,bartlet,It's not good for a person to keep setting goals?,west_wing
11216,bartlet,"Well, I'm told that most men lead lives of quiet desperation.",west_wing
11217,bartlet,I think you're talking about the Lincoln Bedroom.,west_wing
11218,bartlet,I think I've made tough choices.,west_wing
11219,bartlet,You don't know anything.,west_wing
11220,bartlet,I'm not trying to get my father to like me.,west_wing

11222,bartlet,"We spoke several times about Kashmir, and she assured me they're working towards a peaceful  resolution. We also had a spirited conversation about chess. ",west_wing
11223,bartlet,"Chess was invented in India. Somewhere around 600 A.D., a gigantic chessboard was constructed  at Fatehpur Sikri which was the capital a long time ago, and human figures were used as chess  pieces. ",west_wing

11230,bartlet,What's China's reaction? ,west_wing
11231,bartlet,"No. I mean, we could try, but they're not gonna go for it. ",west_wing
11232,bartlet,What are they asking for? ,west_wing
11233,bartlet,I'm assuming Nancy and Fitzwallace and the Chiefs...,west_wing
11234,bartlet,We have a pretty good sense of the worst-case scenario? ,west_wing
11235,bartlet,"All right, we know the play. ",west_wing
11236,bartlet,She gave me these beautiful chess sets. ,west_wing
11237,bartlet,Yeah. I'm on my way. Let Fitzwallace know I'm gonna order the Seventh Fleet into the Taiwan Strait. ,west_wing
11238,bartlet,"Listen, they start voting in Hartsfield's landing in about two and a half hours, so this may  end up being somebody else's problem.  The scale of the war  games is unprecedented? ",west_wing
11239,bartlet,After our next move comes their next move. ,west_wing
11270,bartlet,Thank you. How are you? ,west_wing
11271,bartlet,"The Prime Minister gave me a few different sets, and I wanted to give them as gifts. ",west_wing
11272,bartlet,The State of the Union was really something else. ,west_wing
11273,bartlet,"This one's a Lotus set, hand-carved camel-bone. She told me it came to her from a direct  descendent of Tan Sen. You know who that was? ",west_wing
11274,bartlet,The greatest musician of his time. ,west_wing
11275,bartlet,"Sixteenth century. He'd go to the human chess matches at the Mogul Court of Emperor Akbar,  and that began the family obsession with the game. Wanna play? ",west_wing

11277,bartlet," You're white, but don't ever touch me. ",west_wing
11278,bartlet,"Ah, the Fibonacci opening. Very interesting. ",west_wing
11279,bartlet,A billion dollars at the Export-Import Bank didn't hurt. ,west_wing
11280,bartlet,"Three billion in direct foreign investment to the forty-four billion China gets. You're an  American, where would you rather put your money? ",west_wing
11281,bartlet,"It's bad. If Kashmir's the most dangerous place on earth, the second most dangerous is the  Taiwan Strait. Taiwan's got four hundred thousand troops on high alert; the size of China's  war games is unprecedented. ",west_wing
11282,bartlet,That's right. Plus guess what?  The Patriot tests aren't why China's  showing its teeth. ,west_wing
11283,bartlet,Are you ready to come inside? ,west_wing
11284,bartlet,"By the end of the week, Taiwan's going to announce they are holding their first free elections. ",west_wing
11295,bartlet,"Yeah.  Give us a minute, would you? ",west_wing
11299,bartlet,"That was a joke. Not so funny, huh? ",west_wing
11301,bartlet,"Yeah. It's hand-carved, it belonged to the Prime Minister's grandfather. He used it to play  with Lord Mounbatten. ",west_wing
11303,bartlet,"Nah, she didn't, we just boosted it from the palace on our way out. I’ve got some little  bottles of shampoo and conditioner, too. ",west_wing

11313,bartlet,"Taiwan's not gonna be our topic. Ah, the Evans Gambit! ",west_wing
11315,bartlet,"A variation of the Giuoco Piano opening, named after a British sea captain, W.D. Evans, who  invented it in 1820 - don't tell me chess moves. ",west_wing

11317,bartlet,Re-election and the Bartlet Psychosis. ,west_wing
11319,bartlet,So we get right back on the horse. ,west_wing
11321,bartlet,"You apologized already, so let's get back on the horse. ",west_wing
11323,bartlet,That makes it more likely we'll learn something. ,west_wing
11324,bartlet,Excuse me; eleven moves. ,west_wing
11325,bartlet,Take your time.  Think happy thoughts... ,west_wing
11326,bartlet,The Spanish brought chess to the court of Charlemagne in 760 AD. Charlemagne is French for Charles  the Great. The Charles is a river in Boston. The Hudson River is actually not a river at all... ,west_wing

11328,bartlet,"It is in the Catskills, but once it gets to Manhattan, it’s a tidal estuary. ",west_wing
11329,bartlet,"Well, how do you think it went? ",west_wing
11330,bartlet,"That’s right, except they didn’t call them Patriots. What did they call them? ",west_wing
11358,bartlet,"Let me tell you, you’re really showing me something tonight. A lot of spunk, a lot of pluck,  this game isn’t all about size, you know. There’s a little thing called heart, and you’ve  got it, my friend. ",west_wing
11361,bartlet,"I had a friend in school who taught me. He was good. He was ranked 18 and under. He was a  really nice guy, everybody liked him. ",west_wing
11362,bartlet,David Wheaton. Everybody had a crush on his sister. ,west_wing
11363,bartlet,"He went on to Princeton and Christmas vacation, he’d saved up to go to San Francisco and he was  on the wharf and he saw a guy beating a woman up and he went in to stop it and the guy stabbed  him to death. ",west_wing
11365,bartlet,"So you know, I had this historic stretch of sleeplessness after our last meeting? ",west_wing
11366,bartlet,Got so bad Leo brought in a guy from ATVA who worked with Josh. ,west_wing
11368,bartlet,"Yeah, but we know him, and I figured he had to go to school for everything, so... Anyway, we  brought him in late at night. ",west_wing
11369,bartlet,He said it was your fault. He said you shouldn’t bother me so much. ,west_wing
11372,bartlet,Let’s go ahead and say the Republicans nominate Ritchie. ,west_wing
11373,bartlet,"First of all, I’d stop for a moment and say, you know, ‘why?’ I mean they got some serious guys  in the field. Kalmbach, Daniel, Wesley? ",west_wing
11375,bartlet, You think the strike against me is nobody likes the smartest kid in the class. ,west_wing
11378,bartlet,"If a guy is a good neighbor, if he puts in a day, if every once in a while he laughs, if every  once in a while he thinks about somebody else and, above all else, if he can find his way to  compassion and, and tolerance, then he’s my brother, I don’t give a damn if he didn’t get past  finger-painting. What I can’t stomach are people who’re out to convince people that the educated  are soft and privileged and out to make them feel like they’re less, then, you know, ‘he may be  educated, but I’m plain-spoken, just like you!’ Especially when we know that education can be a  silver bullet, it can be the silver bullet, Toby! For crime, poverty, unemployment, drugs, hate... ",west_wing
11380,bartlet,I’m saying I don’t watch the pitch go by. ,west_wing
11381,bartlet,"And if I do, it’s not because my father... ",west_wing
11382,bartlet," Can we talk... God, can we talk about, please, can we talk about my father with some respect?  The man’s gone, can we... he’s my father, he wasn’t a Dickens character! ",west_wing
11383,bartlet,Don’t cheat. I know exactly where the pieces on the board are. I know exactly where the pieces  are on Sam’s board. I know exactly where the pieces still are on David Wheaton’s.  ,west_wing
11384,bartlet,All right.  You can bring the ambassador back now and get Beijing. ,west_wing
11385,bartlet,"I don’t know, but for sure we’re gonna blame you. ",west_wing
11386,bartlet,I don’t know. Toby keeps coming back at me with this... I don’t know. He says I let the pitch go by. ,west_wing
11387,bartlet,"I soften... I smooth myself out publicly. It’s not a put-on, by the way, I’m honestly folksy. ",west_wing
11388,bartlet,"Yeah, well, he keeps coming back at me. ",west_wing
11389,bartlet,Just playing some chess.  ,west_wing
11400,bartlet,I don’t want to be killed. ,west_wing
11402,bartlet,Pick your king up. We’re not done playing yet. ,west_wing

11411,bartlet,Is that the same thing? ,west_wing
11412,bartlet,Turn them around. I’ll make some calls and thank people. ,west_wing
11413,bartlet,"Thank you, by the way. ",west_wing
11414,bartlet,"Ten years, but you’ve got it. ",west_wing
11415,bartlet, But everybody wakes up alive in the morning and saves a little face. ,west_wing
11416,bartlet,You have a lot of help. You listen to everybody and then you call the play.  That’s checkmate. ,west_wing
11417,bartlet," I love them. ""Laissez-faire doctrine."" 15 letters.",west_wing
11418,bartlet,"No, that's not the answer. See, 'cause Social Darwinism isn't a doctrine. It's a  force of nature. The answer is ""libertarianism."" ",west_wing
11419,bartlet,"Boo boo, I gave up on getting you out the door in the late 70's. Plus, it's your  birthday. You're old, and you don't move around that fast.",west_wing
11420,bartlet,"I know, so I'm shading in the extra box. ",west_wing
11421,bartlet,"It's your birthday week. It's a week of festivities like Mardi Gras or Lent. Three  letters. ""It may be bitter."" ""Tea,"" right?",west_wing
11422,bartlet,"'Cause ""woman"" doesn't fit.",west_wing
11423,bartlet,"Hey, when the Medical Board gives you the results of the hearing, do they slap it up  on one of those X-ray light boards? ""Here's where the problem is with your testimony, Abbey. Here and here.""",west_wing

11426,bartlet,Standing by your convictions isn't gonna get you anywhere. This isn't some guy off the  street talking. I'm a very successful politician.,west_wing

11434,bartlet,I kind of wished you'd mentioned that before.,west_wing

11436,bartlet," For dessert, we're having Kumquat Napoleons.",west_wing
11438,bartlet,Donna was invited. All the women of the west wing. We're doing a calendar.,west_wing

11441,bartlet,"Look, obviously, we knew this was gonna be a thing, but it doesn't have to be tonight,  right?",west_wing
11442,bartlet,I'm pretty sure he means Leo.,west_wing
11456,bartlet,I'm gonna need you later.,west_wing
11457,bartlet,I want to work on my toast.,west_wing
11458,bartlet,I don't need help writing it. I can write a damn toast. I just want to say it out  loud to somebody. Any warm body is fine.,west_wing
11459,bartlet,"So when I give you the signal, we'll go off someplace.",west_wing
11460,bartlet,"It'll be something like ""Charlie, we're gonna go work on the toast now.""",west_wing
11461,bartlet,I think Abbey's gonna pull a hamstring about tomorrow.,west_wing
11462,bartlet,I'm feeling all right about it.,west_wing

11491,bartlet,"Okay. I should... Yeah. Okay. ""Thank you all for being here tonight."" By the way, do  you know where the term ""toast"" comes from?",west_wing
11492,bartlet,The Stuarts. They put a piece of toast in your wine cup to improve the flavor.,west_wing

11499,bartlet,"We're pretty sure the Board was evenly divided, and Nolan was the deciding vote, which  dictated a lot of her... Damn it!",west_wing
11501,bartlet,"Yeah, they worked together for 20 years, and I was the governor who appointed him to  the Board.",west_wing
11502,bartlet,"C.J., you should probably tell Abbey.",west_wing
11504,bartlet,The Union-Leader says Nolan's gonna recuse himself.,west_wing
11505,bartlet,They're gonna suspend her license for a year.,west_wing
11506,bartlet,I was pretty concerned about that.,west_wing

11508,bartlet,"This is Brendan McGann, right?",west_wing
11509,bartlet,Yeah. I don't know what to say about that.,west_wing
11541,bartlet,That's when the juices get flowing.,west_wing
11542,bartlet,I could tell the story of the ditch digger.,west_wing
11543,bartlet,"Abbey and I were walking along and we see a ditch digger, and I said, ""Aren't you glad  you married me? You could've married a ditch digger."" And she said, ""Jed, if I'd married  him, he'd be President."" What do you think?",west_wing
11544,bartlet,"In my house, anyone who uses one word when they could have used ten just isn't trying  hard. Let's keep at it.",west_wing
11554,bartlet, What the hell is going on?!,west_wing
11555,bartlet,I was gone for 45 minutes. They were all Americans when I left.,west_wing
11556,bartlet,"I called Nolan. I know I shouldn't have, but I'm sorry. The rules are different when it  comes to my family. There isn't a man in America who doesn't understand that. I also  think partiality isn't a vice in this case. He knows you, and that's a good thing. He's  gonna consider not recusing himself.",west_wing
11557,bartlet,"Okay. I'm gonna do a toast and everything in a minute, and I'll tell the ditch story,  but I wanted to say that I love you very much.",west_wing
11558,bartlet,I'm standing right here!,west_wing
11559,bartlet,Good to be talking to you.,west_wing
11560,bartlet,The Mural Room as a matter of fact.,west_wing
11561,bartlet,"That's right, and Thursday night we're going to talk about energy dependence versus  independence and cleaner burning fuels that get up to 80 miles per gallon versus  oil-based fuels that pump billions of pounds of pollution into our air and perhaps  just as important our vulnerable to very volatile price spikes. We want to talk about  controlling our destiny through innovation instead of relying so heavily on foreign oil.",west_wing
11562,bartlet,"Yeah. 65% of the world's oil reserves are in the Mid East. 3% are here at home. I,  for one, wouldn't mind sending a little less of my money over there and the only  alternative is to use less oil.",west_wing
11563,bartlet,"I hope so, but there'll be plenty of time for campaigning come the fall. Thursday night  is about America's energy future.",west_wing
11564,bartlet,"I'm-- Terry, I'm sorry.",west_wing
11565,bartlet,That was my ninth interview this morning.,west_wing
11566,bartlet,"Well, I guess we'll be ready to run against whoever we have to run against.",west_wing
11567,bartlet,Rob Ritchie? I don't know him very well.,west_wing
11569,bartlet,We can talk about my book.,west_wing
11580,bartlet,Good morning. Thanks for having me.,west_wing
11581,bartlet,"And to shill for my new energy plan, which is about raising fuel economy standards, working  with Detroit to develop hybrid cars, and using tax incentives to promote alternative energy.",west_wing
11582,bartlet,"After a decade of wars with Iraq and a spread of religious extremism in Saudi Arabia, we  still rely on this very dangerous, very uncertain region for a quarter of our oil reserves.  And I, for one, wouldn't mind not sending quite so much of my money there.",west_wing
11583,bartlet,Exploring is what Magellan did and Balboa and Jacques Cousteau. What we're talking about  is drilling which is the only way you know if there's oil there and which will forever  damage national treasures like ANWAR.,west_wing
11584,bartlet,Clean Coal is a term that pollsters came up with 'cause it polls higher then regular coal.  What we want are real cleaner burning fuels. We want to control our destiny through  innovation and that's what we're going to be talking about Thursday night.,west_wing
11585,bartlet,There'll be plenty of bait in September-October.,west_wing
11586,bartlet,I'll read it when he does.,west_wing
11587,bartlet,"I don't know, Leslie. I think we might be talking about a .22 caliber mind in a .357 magnum world.",west_wing
11588,bartlet,"Okay, thanks again.  Who's next?",west_wing
11614,bartlet,We hearing from the Michigan delegation?,west_wing
11615,bartlet,Polluters aren't going to write the environmental laws. What about the Energy's Workers Union?,west_wing
11616,bartlet,"Let me ask you something. You're pretty dumb, did you take offense? Look at that. I did it again.",west_wing
11617,bartlet,I don't know. I guess the biggest names.,west_wing
11621,bartlet,"All right, I'm going back to work.",west_wing
11695,bartlet,"(singing) Another sky Another June Another something that rhymes with June Another reason, another season For making... (stops singing) Wait a sec.",west_wing
11696,bartlet,"No, wait a sec. He's absolutely right. Hang on.",west_wing
11697,bartlet,"Excuse me. I'm sorry for interrupting. No, no, keep your seats. Leo? You're absolutely right.",west_wing
11698,bartlet,"We shouldn't show up. Tell the Whip we want to yield all our time. While they're going  in front of the cameras complaining about me making fun of Ritchie, the Democrats will  be caucusing on literacy and tuition tax credits. We want to yield all our time.",west_wing
11725,bartlet,"All right, here we go. What time is it?",west_wing
11726,bartlet,"I've been meaning to tell you, you've done really well this week with the open-mike thing.",west_wing
11727,bartlet,Didn't turn out too bad.,west_wing
11765,bartlet,"Okay. We're e-filing the old 1040A. You're single, head of your household, Deanna's a  dependent, your adjusted gross income is $35,000 per annum.",west_wing
11766,bartlet,Suckers. Okay. Your mom's Social Security pension benefits is $1536. Police pension $2400.,west_wing
11767,bartlet,"""Do you take standard deduction, or do you itemize?""",west_wing
11768,bartlet,Did you make any charitable donations?,west_wing
11769,bartlet, You're better off with the standard deduction.,west_wing
11770,bartlet,"I'm hitting 'send' now. If you're lying about any of this, you're going to the joint.",west_wing
11771,bartlet,"It's gonna tell us what your refund is, but I've done a quick calculation, and it'll be  $700.",west_wing
11772,bartlet,"You spent it already, haven't you?",west_wing
11773,bartlet,Can I tell you what's messed up about James Bond?,west_wing
11774,bartlet,Shaken not stirred will get you cold water with a dash of gin and dry vermouth. The  reason you stir it with a special spoon is so not to chip the ice. James is ordering a  weak martini and being snooty about it.,west_wing
11775,bartlet,And you don't even need a stamp. Hand it over.,west_wing
11776,bartlet,Whatever. Hand it over.,west_wing
11777,bartlet,That's not quite how we see it.,west_wing
11779,bartlet,"Let's go inside.  Milo, Coop, would you help Mr. Young find his pockets, please?",west_wing
11783,bartlet,Are there populated areas nearby?,west_wing
11785,bartlet,Conference in the Chief with the Radiological Assistance Team.,west_wing
11786,bartlet,"Charlie, get me Fitzwallace, Nancy McNally, and let the senior members of the NSC know  I might need them tonight.",west_wing
11816,bartlet,What would you have done a half hour ago that hasn't already been done?,west_wing
11817,bartlet,"I know. If only technology could invent some way to get in touch with you in an  emergency. Some sort of telephonic device with a personalized number we could call to let  you know that we needed you. Perhaps it would look something like this, Mr. Moto!  ",west_wing
11818,bartlet,You know I've noticed that other people keep a set of comfortable clothes in their office  for when they have to work late. I like that -- you should do that too.,west_wing
11819,bartlet,I'm pretty sure he's right.,west_wing
11820,bartlet,I knew this a half hour ago.,west_wing
11821,bartlet,This whole night I'm going to be a half hour smarter than you.,west_wing
11822,bartlet,Is that his name or is that what we think it is right now?,west_wing
11823,bartlet,In what happens to be the most dangerous and unanticipated situation for the  transportation of nuclear waste.,west_wing
11824,bartlet, What's that meeting next door?,west_wing
11849,bartlet,A trip to Banana Republic would have killed you?  Let's go.,west_wing
11850,bartlet,That's never been a problem for us before.,west_wing
11851,bartlet,"Well, that's FEMA's call, isn't it?",west_wing
11852,bartlet,"I should set a ransom. I'll tell you what the radiation levels are, but first I want your  electoral votes. Or is that a bad strategy?",west_wing
11853,bartlet,"Okay, no ransom. We'll play this one straight. What about other shipments?",west_wing
11854,bartlet,Have we stopped the train?,west_wing
11855,bartlet,They beefed up the escort?,west_wing
11898,bartlet,Yup. It was the rebate.,west_wing
11899,bartlet,We wanted to inject some money into retail and tourism.,west_wing
11900,bartlet,The economy might have improved on its own by then.,west_wing
11901,bartlet,Not that much. Most people did what you did. They saved or they paid down debt.,west_wing
11902,bartlet,"We do, but when the next guy's President.",west_wing
11903,bartlet,I'll tell you what I find interesting though.,west_wing
11904,bartlet,"You. $35,000 a year, a sister to support, and you gave $1,435 to charity. I'm not so  sure that check isn't better off in your hands than ours. Oh, I'm taking it. Don't be  ridiculous. But when you get to your place tonight you're going to find a new DVD player  and that wimp-ass Bond movie.",west_wing
11905,bartlet,And I threw in Yeoman of the Guard on CD.,west_wing
11906,bartlet,"Yeah. Charlie, let's get that woman on the phone. I'm feeling magical tonight.",west_wing
11907,bartlet,They're in the tunnel now and the readings don't show anything beyond the predictable  level of background radiation. The flatbed is back on its way and the Carlsbad is behind  gates so we dodged the bullet.,west_wing
11908,bartlet,"We packed this stuff in 2 inches of stainless steel, 4 inches of lead. We've rammed it  with trains and dropped it from helicopters and it still isn't going to protect us from  the thing we haven't thought of. They took a cask out to Aberdeen Proving Ground and shot  a TOW missile clean through it. They showed me video. What can I do for you?",west_wing
11909,bartlet,Is there anybody left who's not?,west_wing
11910,bartlet,For how long have you been in recovery?,west_wing
11911,bartlet,You haven't had a drink since you were 22?,west_wing
11912,bartlet,I didn't start drinking till I was 25. What the hell do you guys count as...,west_wing
11913,bartlet,You and James Bond ought to team up.,west_wing
11914,bartlet,"He's ordering a watered down martini, and Leo what the hell is this meeting that's going  on all night across the hall?",west_wing
11915,bartlet,"Hey, did I hear right? Are you taking your name off that bill?",west_wing
11916,bartlet,You're taking your name off. We can't campaign on it.,west_wing
11917,bartlet,"And if somebody's attacking us, you know what to do. ",west_wing
11918,bartlet," Yeah, but don't discount the possibility  that it might be Leo.",west_wing
11919,bartlet,"John, despite this recent revelation that you drank beer in college I've always liked you  a little more than you thought I did, but that's not why you're staying. It's this.   Four words. ",west_wing
11920,bartlet,"Me, too. Anything else?",west_wing
11921,bartlet,Let's go. I'm a magic man.,west_wing
11922,bartlet,Tell Josh that General Pulaski was a Polish Brigadier General who vanquished the Russian  and Prussian military then came to the colonies and commanded our cavalry during the  American revolution.,west_wing
11923,bartlet,"It says here in a briefing paper hastily written by Deputy Josh Lyman that in the '60s  when the Madison Superintendent of Schools banned Twelfth Night for reasons passing  understanding, a Mrs. Molly Morello had students over to her house on Saturdays to  read it. ",west_wing
11924,bartlet,Yeah 'cause all I had tonight was a nuclear spill in Idaho. It says she came in two hours  early to teach an AP English class she developed herself because the school didn't offer  one.,west_wing
11925,bartlet,"Sounds like she deserves a proclamation. I wish I could give her one, but I can't. ",west_wing
11926,bartlet,"It's just too much inside baseball, you know?",west_wing
11927,bartlet,"Charlie, I've been tapping my finger on the desk for about a minute now.",west_wing
11928,bartlet,"The magic man thing works a lot better when you pick up on the signals, Tonto. What's  that you say? There's a phone call for Donna? ",west_wing
11929,bartlet,"Good evening, this is the White House, for whom are you holding?",west_wing
11930,bartlet, Tell her where you are.,west_wing
11931,bartlet, She didn't do anything.,west_wing
11932,bartlet,"It's Jed Bartlet, Mrs. Morello. I've got a few questions. When you taught Beowulf, did  you make the kids read it in the original Middle English or did you use a translation?",west_wing
11933,bartlet,Okay. We're going to call that the James Bond version.,west_wing
11934,bartlet,What are you planning on doing with your retirement?,west_wing
11935,bartlet,I'd stay away from the Elk Horn area of Idaho for a little while. You'll read why in the  morning. Let's talk about Twelfth Night.,west_wing
11971,bartlet,Thank you all so much. Bye-bye. ,west_wing
11972,bartlet, What are you talking about?,west_wing
11973,bartlet,That's got to be 50 million chips!,west_wing
11974,bartlet,"Leo, how the hell did... ",west_wing
11975,bartlet,That's the end of Antares.,west_wing
11976,bartlet,"98 thousand workers, I think 75 thousand in the US. Plus the kidney punch at NASDAQ... ",west_wing
11977,bartlet," Fitz! Fitz, you old polecat, you old so-and-so!",west_wing
11978,bartlet,What do you use heavy water for?,west_wing
12004,bartlet,Thank you so much. Thank you.,west_wing
12005,bartlet,There's nothing we can do.,west_wing
12006,bartlet,"Good morning.  Yeah, we can't do it.",west_wing
12008,bartlet,That's good enough for me.,west_wing
12010,bartlet,"Well, Canada, Russia - roughly the same relationship with the US. Fitz, you old horse  thief, you old muckety-muck!",west_wing
12011,bartlet,Josh says the director of MinAtom says it's commercial power production.,west_wing
12012,bartlet,"Well, that's what was said by my National Security Advisor twenty minutes ago, right after  it was said by the Secretaries of State and Defense. And, for what it's worth, the directors  of the CIA, NSA, FBI and Naval Intelligence.",west_wing
12015,bartlet,You think the Iranians forced them to build them a heavy water reactor?,west_wing
12017,bartlet,"Crap. And even if that were the case, it doesn't make them Jean Valjean. They want to power  broker in the Middle East. Just what the doctor ordered for the Middle East. ",west_wing
12018,bartlet,"All right, while avoiding the biggest diplomacy disaster since I don't know when -  Josh, Leo, you guys have to figure out a way to get me out of it.",west_wing
12036,bartlet,"You're gonna get Secret Service protection, but I can't order it unless you sign this  piece of paper, so sign this piece of paper.",west_wing
12038,bartlet,"Because Ron says it is, and around here we do whatever Ron says.",west_wing
12040,bartlet,"Good for you. With all your years of training and experience in sniffing out crime,  your opinion really carries a lot of weight with me.",west_wing
12042,bartlet,"We're talking about one bodyguard. I have twelve, and that's before I leave the house.  You ever count the number of guns that come along with me when Abbey and I take in a  play at the Kennedy Center? Do I seem fragile to you?",west_wing
12044,bartlet,"I don't care! You're part of my family, and this thing is happening and I simply won't  permit it. Sign the piece of paper.",west_wing
12045,bartlet,"Let me tell you something! The last time a member of my staff got a death threat, they  missed him and hit me!",west_wing
12050,bartlet,"Oh man, the greatest campaign speech ever about money - FDR promises to tighten our belts.  What's he do when he gets here - spends more than we knew could be spent. And it's 'cause  he discovered it's better for long-term growth. ",west_wing
12052,bartlet,"Hey, I should be able to reference that speech. When did he give that? It was in the  industrial North East.",west_wing

And as soon as he's sworn in I'm telling him to appoint me his  Vice President because I'm not going to the bunker.

12208,bartlet,Are you telling me the Qumari defence minister may have ordered an attack on the  Golden Gate Bridge?,west_wing
12209,bartlet,We have a diplomatic relationship with this country.,west_wing
12210,bartlet,"He's coming here. Shareef is coming here, in like, ten days, isn't he?",west_wing
12216,bartlet,We want to ask the Justice Department to indict Qumari Minister of Defense. We’re saying  he’s a terror kingpin. We’re saying he’s killed I don’t know how many civilians and how  many of Tommy’s Marines. We’re saying he’s compromised I don’t know how many agents  throughout the world and we’re saying he’s done it in the clothing of an ally. This isn’t  a cave dweller. This is Capone. You haven’t got it. ,west_wing
12240,bartlet," I’ve been seeing a shrink, by the way. I had trouble sleeping and Leo  brought in a guy. I feel ridiculous talking out loud like this, but he said... Doesn’t  matter. I just can’t believe it’s been a year. Anyway. ",west_wing

12259,bartlet,Fitz makes a reasonable point. Doesn't it pretty much go without saying that I revoked  it after he tried to blow up the Golden Gate Bridge?,west_wing
12260,bartlet,Why the hell do we need...? He's coming here on his own. He's delivering himself on  a Lear jet.,west_wing

12273,bartlet,What do they want me to eat?,west_wing
12274,bartlet,"Ah, the marriage incentives. What a bunch of horse manure.",west_wing
12275,bartlet,Is marriage really something that should be incentivised? And where the hell are all  the small government conservatives when we're talking about Washington getting into the  yenta business?,west_wing

12340,bartlet,"Josh, what the hell did you do to this welfare vote?",west_wing
12344,bartlet,The fund-raiser was my idea. I've known the Archbishop for 20 years and I'm not playing  politics with the church. Did anyone want to ask me abut this? You've got me running the  vote from the mezzanine floor of a Broadway theatre. Where are we in the vote?,west_wing
12347,bartlet," True or false, Josh: My life would be better right now if you and your  girlfriend swapped jobs? Why is it for every good thing you do around here, we've got  to endure three screwiest.",west_wing
12349,bartlet,Sorry doesn't get me 218. It doesn't get back the ad that slipped through your office  any more then it gets back tobacco which you gave away for lunch money. And why the hell  don't you know what Ritchie's commitments are before you get anywhere near my schedule?  I've got the Presidential Box at a cattle call. Win the damn vote.,west_wing

12375,bartlet,More counsel is going to help me violate international law.,west_wing
12376,bartlet,It's pretty easy to say anything is a war scenario.,west_wing
12377,bartlet,The war on poverty. It's a slippery slope.,west_wing
12378,bartlet,There are moral absolutes.,west_wing
12379,bartlet,Il Principe has justified every act of oppression...,west_wing

12395,bartlet,Doesn't the law also require that I not assassinate someone?,west_wing
12396,bartlet,I know. One of them was mine.,west_wing
12397,bartlet,Assume for a second I say yes. How do we do it? Fitz walks up to him with a gun?,west_wing
12398,bartlet,The things we choose to care about.,west_wing
12399,bartlet,"If it can't happen here, then why'd we care that Shareef was delivering himself?",west_wing
12400,bartlet,How many over there know about this?,west_wing
12401,bartlet,And some people in Bermuda?,west_wing
12402,bartlet," Okay. Well... surely, this is the most absurd meeting I ever sat in, and  friends, that is saying something.",west_wing
12403,bartlet,What does the pen do? Squirts poison?,west_wing
12404,bartlet,We give him it boxed. Tell them to put it in a box.,west_wing
12425,bartlet,"It's ""The War of the Roses."" All the Henrys, and all the Richards, for that matter.",west_wing
12426,bartlet,Yeah. There's also singing.,west_wing
12427,bartlet,"No, but they're gonna sing from time to time, and one of the songs is a song I love.  I can't think of the name now, but it's an Edwardian... It always reminds me... It makes  me think of college, like, I don't know, like they should be singing it in the dining  hall at Christ College at Cambridge. The chorus is, ""And victorious in war shall be made  glorious in peace."" I was just singing it this morning.",west_wing
12428,bartlet,"Good. Yeah. Let me ask you something. Is there a crime, which if it wasn't illegal, you  would do?",west_wing
12429,bartlet,"Right, but you wouldn't rob a bank?",west_wing
12430,bartlet,"Connecticut had a law prohibiting the use of contraceptives. It was written out of rage  against adultery. But in the age of AIDS, don't Connecticut residents do more for the  general welfare by flagrantly breaking the law?",west_wing

12447,bartlet,It's a hand-carved incense burner. Gypsum and sandalwood.,west_wing
12454,bartlet," I saw your resume, so we don't need to talk about that. What have you  been doing recently?",west_wing
12455,bartlet,Uh-huh. And before that?,west_wing
12456,bartlet,You're a professional gambler.,west_wing
12457,bartlet,Okay. Why did you leave the White House?,west_wing
12458,bartlet, Would you mind waiting outside just a moment?,west_wing
12459,bartlet," Is this a joke? If it's a joke, it's both funny and well-executed, but I think  you and I both know that it's not. I send you out to replace Delores Landingham, and that's  what you came home with?",west_wing
12460,bartlet,She was an alpaca farmer who needed two tries to get her own name.,west_wing
12461,bartlet,Don't worry about it. I'm gonna get the Personnel Office on it. I got to go change for  New York.,west_wing
12500,bartlet,"Are you pledging a fraternity or something, 'cause this would be a good one.",west_wing
12501,bartlet,What's with you and this woman?,west_wing
12511,bartlet,"They're gonna find out it's us. We could make it look like the plane went down, but they're  gonna find out it's us, and I'm gonna be running for reelection while I'm fighting a war  against Qumar.",west_wing
12512,bartlet,What do you want from me?,west_wing
12513,bartlet,This isn't a matter of religion.,west_wing
12514,bartlet,I recognize that there's evil in the world.,west_wing
12515,bartlet,Doesn't this mean we join the league of ordinary nations?,west_wing
12516,bartlet,That's not my objection.,west_wing
12517,bartlet,It's just wrong. It's absolutely wrong.,west_wing
12518,bartlet,"Yeah, I know. Listen, politics aside, and I don't want to make a big deal out of it, but  you probably insulted the church, and you can head it off at the pass if you speak to the  Cardinal tonight.",west_wing
12519,bartlet,"Yeah.  No, I don't understand that. The center fielder for the Yankees is an accomplished  classical guitarist. People who like baseball can't like books?",west_wing
12520,bartlet,No. Something horrible happened about an hour ago.,west_wing
12521,bartlet,"C.J. Cregg was getting threats so we put an agent on her. He's a good guy. He was on my  detail for a while, and he was in Rosslyn. He walked in the middle of an armed robbery,  and was shot and killed after detaining one of the suspects.",west_wing
12522,bartlet," We should have a great debate, Rob. We owe it to everyone. When I was running as a  governor, I didn't know anything. I made them start Bartlet college in my dining room.  Two hours every morning on foreign affairs and the military. You can do that.",west_wing
12523,bartlet,"I wasn't, Rob. But you've turned being un-engaged into a Zen-like thing, and you shouldn't  enjoy it so much is all, and if it appears at times as if I don't like you, that's the  reason why.",west_wing
12524,bartlet,They're playing my song.,west_wing
12525,bartlet,"In the future, if you're wondering, ""Crime. Boy, I don't know"" is when I decided to kick  your ass.",west_wing

12527,bartlet,"There's a guy down here holding a sign that says, ""Eight more years."" Don't get me wrong,  I like your thinking, but I've probably tested the Constitution about as far as Abbey's  going to allow me to for a little while.  We need to find energy alternatives. We're getting  our cue. We're getting it right now. The Republicans are busy. They're trying to convince  us that they care about new energy and that they're not in the vest pockets of big oil,  and that's a tough sell. I don't envy them, 'cause their only hope is that we don't notice  that they're the ones who are filling the hole with water every night, and I think Americans  are smarter then that. I think we noticed. ",west_wing
12530,bartlet,"This isn't a time for people whose doomsday scenario is a little less at the pump for Texaco  and Shell. This isn't a time for people who say there aren't any energy alternatives, just  because they can't think of any. This is a time for American heros, and we reach for the stars.",west_wing

12561,bartlet,I'm amazed it's only down 270.,west_wing

12563,bartlet,"Driscoll announced it was filling, and Jennings and DWA were in the fund.",west_wing
12564,bartlet,It's against the law to campaign on a military base.,west_wing
12565,bartlet,These army guys are DRF-1. They're division ready. They can be deployed in two hours.  These navy guys are going to deploy overseas for six months.,west_wing

12568,bartlet,"This is the greatest fighting force in the history of the world, and I want to tell you why.",west_wing
12573,bartlet,"So what will I remember? What will I tell my grandchildren? I'll tell them that I stood on the  Great Wall of China, and that I stood in the well of the U.S. House of Representitives. I'll tell  them that I sat with kings and cardinals and made an appointment to the Supreme Court, and I'll  tell them that one morning in September I got to spend a few minutes with the men and women of  Air Wing One. God bless you and your families and may he continue to shed his magnificent grace  upon the United States of America.",west_wing

12592,bartlet,It's still mostly transportation and technology?,west_wing
12593,bartlet,"Have Josh and Toby weigh in at some point, okay?",west_wing
12594,bartlet,Come on in. Nice to meet you.,west_wing
12595,bartlet,"I's crazy I know, but sometimes the schedule gets so tight that we have to schedule meetings  on the plane, so we ask you to fly with us and hit you on the way back.",west_wing
12596,bartlet,Were you impressed by the plane?,west_wing
12597,bartlet,It's got an apartment and an operating room.,west_wing
12598,bartlet,"Okay. Well, you've met with Donald McKittridge-- he directs the Office of Presidential Personnel.",west_wing
12599,bartlet,You had a moment to meet with Charlie Young?,west_wing
12600,bartlet,He's probably mentioned that this was a job where you to need to be able to hold a lot of  names and dates and numbers in your head.,west_wing
12601,bartlet,You were told what the pay scale was?,west_wing
12602,bartlet,"Well, for instance, we have our own 747, and it's flown by an Air Force general.",west_wing
12603,bartlet,"Okay, let's talk about your last job.",west_wing
12656,bartlet,"There's a tremendous amount of informatin you need to keep track of: dates, names, number,  things I'm not good with.",west_wing
12657,bartlet,"It's not intellect, it's memory. It's a different gift. A wonderful one. I've never had it.",west_wing
12658,bartlet,"Well... okay, I'll try and find that time, but let's get back to you. What would you say was  the most challenging part of working for the Ambassador of France?",west_wing
12659,bartlet,I make fun of the French as much as anybody and I don't even know what that meant.,west_wing
12660,bartlet,"Nah, that's okay. I think you're terrific and I appreciate your coming in and talking to us.",west_wing
12661,bartlet,"Please, the market's down 425 points.",west_wing
12662,bartlet,425 points represents billions of dollars which aren't there anymore heading into the fourth  quarter which is Christmas.,west_wing
12663,bartlet,Why does Gallup have it a one-point race?,west_wing
12664,bartlet,"Well, one day I'll buy you a beer and you'll tell us all how you did it.",west_wing
12701,bartlet,Seth Weinberger's assistant has come forward with the information that he was having an  affair with a colleague and a newspaper has printed it.,west_wing
12702,bartlet,"You tell me. He'd already stepped down over OSHA. It's been two months. This is an assistant  getting her name in the paper and it's unbelievably hurtful to his wife. I don't understand it.  I don't understand the paper printed it either, but that's another day. This is terrible.",west_wing
12703,bartlet,"Mitch, come on in.  Just rock and roll, Sam.",west_wing
12704,bartlet,We have your input. You're talking about the exemption.,west_wing

12707,bartlet,"Mr. Secretary, it's not your job to tell me whose support I'm losing. We have people who  do that. It's your job to tell me whose support you just got for me.",west_wing
12708,bartlet,Whatever. Seth Weinberger's old assistant...,west_wing
12709,bartlet,"I don't think a lot of blind loyalty, but I think a lot less of blind betrayal.",west_wing
12710,bartlet,"Yeah, that's probably why.",west_wing

12712,bartlet,"You think when your folks got you out in '74, they imagined they were taking you to a place  that'd be willing to make you a Congressman?",west_wing

13225,bartlet,"I didn't think you did. So, why don't we stick to what government can do-- which is collect money  and distribute it-- and stop wasting time by sentimentalizing family.",west_wing
13227,bartlet,"That wasn't the question, Larry. The question was, ""What do I have against families?"" and  the answer is I have nothing against them at all.",west_wing
13228,bartlet,They simply aren't mentioned in the Executive Powers section.,west_wing
13238,bartlet,What are we doing right now?,west_wing
13239,bartlet,"I'm meeting with the leadership, I'm signing six Executive Orders I don't yet understand...",west_wing
13240,bartlet,"God, I thought that was a closet.",west_wing
13241,bartlet,"All right, the rooms got four doors, it's huge.",west_wing
13242,bartlet,Do you understand them?,west_wing
13243,bartlet,"C.J., what are you doing?",west_wing
13245,bartlet, He's standing right there.,west_wing
13246,bartlet,Would you get your ass in here? Could everyone stop acting strange?,west_wing
13250,bartlet,"It's our second day, how do you think it's going so far?",west_wing
13318,bartlet,Thanks for coming down.,west_wing
13319,bartlet,They turn around the ship in exchange for what?,west_wing
13320,bartlet,"They're arming the Bahji, Leo. Two training camps of which the Israelis just attacked.  I've gotta turn around the boat-- tonight. Tomorrow we'll worry about tomorrow.",west_wing
13321,bartlet,What's available from the Sixth Fleet?,west_wing
13322,bartlet,Stop the boat. Don't shoot it unless I tell you to.,west_wing
13343,bartlet,Did you have a good day?,west_wing
13344,bartlet,"You know what I remember he said to me? He said, ""Mr. President, when I hear black footsteps  behind me, I'm scared. When I hear white footsteps, I'm not.""",west_wing
13345,bartlet,"You pay for these things for such a long time. Too long, don't you think?",west_wing
13346,bartlet,We made a mistake... I corrected it. I'll make more.,west_wing
13347,bartlet,Am I going to lose New Hampshire?,west_wing
13348,bartlet,"I don't mind blowing the knucklehead stuff like Rooker... Rooker's not knucklehead, but...  if I'm making mistakes there, how do I know I'm not doing it when it comes to matters like  death and destruction?",west_wing
13349,bartlet,"All right. When we're done tonight, we should talk about moving money to Ohio.",west_wing
13350,bartlet,Not anymore. He's dead.,west_wing
13351,bartlet,"And stay up in my face, okay?",west_wing
13352,bartlet,"I swear to God, the winner of this debate's going to be the next President. Anybody want  to be on the losing team?",west_wing
13353,bartlet,"Then let's pump it up. Let's go, Claudia Jean.",west_wing
13376,bartlet,"All right, let's do a drill.",west_wing
13378,bartlet,Too much money for too little protection.,west_wing
13380,bartlet,"That would offer some children a choice of better schools, but I haven't given up the  ghost on better schools for everybody, and vouchers drain money from that goal.",west_wing
13382,bartlet,"First of all, it's important to understand the President doesn't make that decision,  though he appoints the Supreme Court Justices who do so. What... any... um... All  right, I'm not going to say that. I'll just go right to... No, I don't. I think you  know that I'm opposed....  Let's not do that. I haven't seen any evidence that  it's a deterrent, and there are more effective... In my state... ",west_wing
13384,bartlet,Let's go-- ten bucks. Crisis of confidence.  You did one square foot of real  estate.,west_wing
13385,bartlet,"Ten bucks for you.  And you-- You big bear, come to me. I'm going to kiss  you right on the mouth.",west_wing
13408,bartlet,"No, I decided to go ahead and wear my lucky tie.",west_wing
13409,bartlet,"Then it's your lucky tie. Why don't you get mine, and we'll go to the plane?",west_wing
13410,bartlet,"Listen, what do you say I sit in on this meeting for a few minutes. We've got time.",west_wing
13431,bartlet,I guess what I don't understand is this. Have I ever exhibited any evidence that I'd  be mad if a tie got ruined?,west_wing
13432,bartlet,The chemicals at the Dry cleaner don't know that.,west_wing
13435,bartlet,"Well, I don't approve of that.",west_wing
13436,bartlet,"I don't approve of that, either. Remember the tie Josh had to give me at the last minute?",west_wing
13437,bartlet,There was a lot of juice in that tie. It was like in the last seconds. Just the energy  getting me out on stage...,west_wing
13438,bartlet,Why are you telling me this now?,west_wing
13439,bartlet,"Oh, my God. You're insane. Are you...? You're insane! Charlie!",west_wing
13440,bartlet,My wife cut it off with scissors.,west_wing
13441,bartlet,"I don't think we have that kind of time, Josh.",west_wing
13444,bartlet," Well, first of all, let's clear up a couple of things. ""Unfunded mandate"" is two  words, not one ""big word."" ",west_wing
13445,bartlet," There are times when we're fifty states and there are times when we're one  country, and have national needs. And the way I know this is that Florida didn't fight  Germany in World War II or establish civil rights. You think states should do the  governing wall-to-wall. That's a perfectly valid opinion. But your state of Florida got  $12.6 billion in federal money last year-- from Nebraskans, and Virginians, and New  Yorkers, and Alaskans, with their Eskimo poetry. 12.6 out of a state budget of $50  billion, and I'm supposed to be using this time for a question, so here it is: Can we  have it back, please?",west_wing
13447,bartlet,"Actually, what you've done in Florida is bring the right together with the far right.  And I don't think Americans are tired of partisan politics; I think they're tired of  hearing career politicians diss partisan politics to get a gig. I've tried it before,  they ain't buying it. That's okay, though. That's okay, though, 'cause partisan  politics is good. Partisan politics is what the founders had in mind. It guarantees  that the minority opinion is heard, and as a lifelong possessor of minority opinions,  I appreciate it. But if you're troubled by it, Governor, you should know, in this  campaign, you've used the word ""liberal"" seventy-four times in one day. It was yesterday.",west_wing
13449,bartlet," No, the question is: Should we focus on 90% of the kids, who go to public school,  or give parents money from the public-school budget to send their kids to private school  at a time when private schools are even turning kids away who can afford it? Public  schools are going to be the best schools in the country. They're gonna be cathedrals.  The answer is a change in the way we finance schools!",west_wing
13450,bartlet," That's the ten-word answer my staff's been looking for for two weeks. There it  is. Ten-word answers can kill you in political campaigns. They're the tip of the sword.  Here's my question: What are the next ten words of your answer? Your taxes are too high?  So are mine. Give me the next ten words. How are we going to do it? Give me ten after  that, I'll drop out of the race right now. Every once in a while... every once in a  while, there's a day with an absolute right and an absolute wrong, but those days almost  always include body counts. Other than that, there aren't very many unnuanced moments  in leading a country that's way too big for ten words. I'm the President of the United  States, not the President of the people who agree with me. And by the way, if the left  has a problem with that, they should vote for somebody else.",west_wing
13502,bartlet,Better than if I won my home state but lost my home country. The only poll that matters closes  in 17 hours.,west_wing
13503,bartlet,"Title 63, Chapter 659, Section 43 of New Hampshire election code says electioneering is prohibited  within a corridor ten feet wide and extending a distance from the entrance door of the building as  determined by the moderator where the election is being held. If anyone knows what that means...",west_wing
13504,bartlet,"Yeah, I voted for the bond issue. It's going to improve public education without a tax abatement.",west_wing
13505,bartlet,"Well, one way or another I imagine we'll be talking tonight. I got to get back. You can hockle  Abbey for awhile. She's taking the next plane.",west_wing
13506,bartlet,"Yeah. Listen, you think you could score me a couple of aspirin?",west_wing
13507,bartlet,"No, it's just a headache. Just me and you today, okay. I'm fine.",west_wing
13508,bartlet,I'll sign these in the car.,west_wing
13509,bartlet,"Okay, this can wait. Let's go.",west_wing
13556,bartlet,Hello. Hi. What's going on?,west_wing
13557,bartlet,What was wrong with the old way?,west_wing
13558,bartlet,What was wrong with the old way?,west_wing
13559,bartlet,I hear you've got rules for meetings.,west_wing
13560,bartlet,"You don't think that's apt to create a resentment among the people who were here before with...?  It's not like the thing wasn't working with... Whatever you may assume, that wasn't a rube  sitting out there, Debbie. She ran the Oval Office for two years and a state house before that.",west_wing
13561,bartlet,"What if, instead of you, I want a dial tone?",west_wing
13562,bartlet,You're going to place a lot of my outgoing calls...,west_wing
13563,bartlet,I can make my own phone call. Don't be...,west_wing
13564,bartlet,I can make my own phone calls.,west_wing
13565,bartlet,That's good. That's a good idea.,west_wing
13566,bartlet,Debbie... I have to ask you. Are we talking about...? Did you bring it up 'cause you...  noticed...? Is there some particular thing today you noticed?,west_wing
13567,bartlet,"No, please. I was talking about something else. Line one is you?",west_wing
13577,bartlet,"I feel like I should be self-deprecating. I mean, it's not inauguration. I could be funny,  right? I don't thibk so. I think it's the wrong note. If I'm thanking campaign staff, maybe. ",west_wing
13578,bartlet,"Halfway aroung the world in Bosnia and Chechnya and Rwanda, they dream of the promise we  fulfilled today of a future we chose, for ourelves, together.",west_wing
13579,bartlet,"Four years ago, we were joined by our highest ideals, by our best hopes, and tonight we're  joined by the same commitment to open new doors of oppurtunity and justice. ",west_wing
13580,bartlet,"To ensure that the promise of the country is the birthright of all the people. We've achieved  so much together always believing, always knowing that America could be made new again and so  it was, and so it will be again. God bless you all. God bless the United States of America.",west_wing
13587,bartlet,Just for a minute at the end. I couldn't see it.,west_wing
13588,bartlet,"Yeah, I know. We can still have tonight, though, right?",west_wing
13596,bartlet,"I don't want to intimidate you, but it turns out I'm the first Democrat in twenty years to  make a clean sweep of the Plains states and I'm not just talking about Iowa and Nebraska.",west_wing
13597,bartlet,"I won the Dakotas. The Badlands. The Black Hills. But let's go down, way down, to the Deep  South and the humid bayou of Louisiana and its nine electoral votes. What manner of man it  must take to win the state, which, by the way, is the only one operating under the Napoleonic  Code of France and I still don't know what that's all about, but back to me...",west_wing
13598,bartlet,Who's your Commander in Chief?,west_wing
13599,bartlet,"Yes. And do the ladies like him? Oh, yes. To the tune of 58%. ",west_wing
13600,bartlet,"I thought we had an understanding with regard to tonight and interruptions, Charlie.  I thought we were men. ",west_wing
13601,bartlet,"It's like what, 1:00 in the morning? ",west_wing
13602,bartlet,"Well, let's send him in.",west_wing
13603,bartlet,"No, what would make you say that?",west_wing
13604,bartlet,"No, no, you could have and I'm not going to take any chances, so let's do it now.",west_wing
13605,bartlet,"Then, I'm behind you 100%.",west_wing
13606,bartlet,"Man, is everything all right?",west_wing
13607,bartlet,"Yeah, look, honey, Sam stopped by.",west_wing
13693,bartlet,"As you can see, we've moved on to the caviar course.",west_wing
13694,bartlet,"I know how you do. Stoli Cristall, the most elegant of vodkas.",west_wing
13695,bartlet,The caviar itself is a product of my advice at the Convention on International Trade in  Endangered Species. We passed a much more stringent bill against the poaching of Caspian  Sea sturgeons.,west_wing
13696,bartlet,California white sturgeon from the Stillman Sea Farm in Elverta. Only the best.,west_wing
13697,bartlet,"Oh, I think you're going to find...",west_wing
13698,bartlet,"Yeah. You're young, Charlie. Don't you want to be having fun right now? ",west_wing
13699,bartlet,"Yeah. Well, we kind of knew it was going to be like this.",west_wing
13700,bartlet,"All right, have a good night.",west_wing
13702,bartlet,"Listen, I'm kind of in the middle of something. Is this anything that could possibly wait  until tomorrow?",west_wing
13704,bartlet,"Well, that's great. Well done. See you tomorrow.",west_wing
13705,bartlet,(to Toby) I was this close.,west_wing
13707,bartlet,"You should marry that girl, Toby.",west_wing
13710,bartlet,Wait a second. End of may? ,west_wing
13711,bartlet,"Hang on, I'm doing math in my head. Yeah, end of May? Why didn't you tell us until now?",west_wing
13712,bartlet,"Yeah, but he's got one.",west_wing
13714,bartlet,"It's my Catholicism, Toby. It works for me.",west_wing
13715,bartlet,And her. Did you break any laws?,west_wing
13716,bartlet,"Then a blessing on your house, young man. Mazel tov.",west_wing
13730,bartlet,"Well, the votes have been counted and the people have spoken, and it's clear that  their will is for me to be able to do and have anything I want.",west_wing
13732,bartlet,There's a new guy from AP?,west_wing
13734,bartlet,"Well the President of Turkmenistan just officially extended the date of adolescence  to twenty-five. So, things like that.",west_wing
13735,bartlet,That's just greedy. Real power is knowing when to leave a little something on  the table.,west_wing
13738,bartlet,"It's a big country, Arnold. Debbie! Where the hell, first of all, are you and where  are my...",west_wing
13739,bartlet,"Ipswich clams don't come from Chesapeake Bay, they come from Ipswich!",west_wing
13740,bartlet,Have her beheaded for my birthday!,west_wing
13742,bartlet,As long as I'm keeping this one.,west_wing
13743,bartlet,"You bet your ass it is. Which, by the way, I can pat anytime I want now. The voters  have spoken. Lowest inflation in twenty years. Housing starts are cyclical, which is  the thing.  What do you got?",west_wing
13744,bartlet," Don't get me wrong, Mark. I think January's a good month...",west_wing
13774,bartlet,"Yeah? It's called penmanship, Watson. Something your generation wouldn't know about  because of the computers. How many of these things am I doing?",west_wing
13775,bartlet,Your system's slowing me down.,west_wing
13776,bartlet,"Hey, can't we have color coding and stickers priority list? Can I get a little  bureaucracy going here?",west_wing
13777,bartlet,"I'm doing basically what the President does. Ask people for things, then thank them  for things. Let's go.  Take the calls to the mansion. I'll meet you there  after this.",west_wing
13778,bartlet,We had a couple of cats when the kids were kids named Mr. Finch and Ms. Wilburforce or  something-- I can't remember-- but...,west_wing
13779,bartlet,"Okay, well, I can't believe my kids didn't think to ask you what to name the cats.  But they used to bring mice into the house and show 'em to me.",west_wing
13780,bartlet,This is how I'm starting to feel about the Swiss.,west_wing
13781,bartlet,That's eleven minutes from now.,west_wing
13782,bartlet,"This meeting's a little premature, isn't it? We should wait ten minutes.",west_wing
13783,bartlet,"This meeting doesn't go in the Sit Room anymore, okay? I don't know why the hell it's  here. This isn't a military operation.",west_wing
13784,bartlet,"My office is a secure room, too, isn't it? Please, somebody tell me it is, or I gotta  go pack some stuff. You see my point?",west_wing
13785,bartlet,"I'm sorry, that sounded funny to me. I'm the kid in bio who laughed all the time.",west_wing
13786,bartlet,"Fifteen. The Shiites, Manny, that's what you want me to take back to my thoracic-surgeon  wife? Get this boy in preop. Somebody tell the Swiss to stop standing in the damn  doorway with a mouse in their mouth. If they're coming in, come in.",west_wing
13787,bartlet,"No, 'cause we're all in a secure room except for the Ayatollah's staff, a Swissair  pilot, and four hundred other people.",west_wing
13788,bartlet,"Mr. Finch and Mrs. Wilberforce. There's nothing wrong with my memory. Though those  are stupid names, and there's something wrong with my kids.",west_wing
13809,bartlet,"No kidding, you want to crash a space probe into Neptune. That's fine with me. I think  we've crashed into most of the planets but $2.5 billion, okay? ",west_wing
13810,bartlet,"If we're going to fail, I want to do it on budget. ",west_wing
13811,bartlet,You know what? Why don't you tell Debbie we're going to do some calls?,west_wing
13812,bartlet,"Yes, calls. Calls. Mr. Sarcasm, with your dry... ""Calls."" I was this close to renaming  one of the oceans after you but no way. Maybe... maybe, one of the species of fish,  like trout.  ""Trout"" is now 'charlie.' Went up to the lake, pulled out a  couple of nice charlie for dinner.",west_wing
13813,bartlet,Look at the size of that charlie you've got mounted on your wall!,west_wing
13817,bartlet,Knew about it? We did it.,west_wing
13820,bartlet,What's the room saying?,west_wing
13823,bartlet,We're not going to not do it. I'm saying just now.,west_wing
13824,bartlet,"Hi. Before you say anything, here's my idea: the kid needs lungs and a heart. Let's  use the Ayatollah's. What are you smiling at?",west_wing
13825,bartlet,"""The Iranians, they've taken to the streets."" Perfect. That goes to the Margaret Museum.",west_wing
13826,bartlet,"He didn't want to try, ""My son is dying and these guys maybe can fix him? And maybe  if our citizens didn't spend quite so much energy denouncing the infidels, they'd have  time to build a damn medical school!""",west_wing
13827,bartlet,"Okay, but just tell me they weren't using cellular technology, 'cause I don't care what  anybody says, it doesn't work yet.",west_wing
13828,bartlet,No. Come on! That's a fifteen-year-old non-combatant on his way to a hospital. I want  you to pretend that plane's got a big red cross on it.,west_wing
13829,bartlet,"Send the communiqué, absolutely. There's a Bahrain Agreement that says... send it.  Tell them to stop. Don't even come close... I don't even want a scent of linkage to  it. A big damn red cross right on that plane.",west_wing
13856,bartlet,Laney says the plane's still six hours out.,west_wing
13857,bartlet,What are you talking about?,west_wing
13858,bartlet,"It's in Pakistan, what does it matter?",west_wing
13859,bartlet,"Okay, but if I need a life-saving procedure, can you make sure the surgeon's suffering  from massive oxygen deprivation?",west_wing
13860,bartlet,"The one guy who can save his son and he tortured his father. That's just bad staff work.  Charlie! Are we sure about Japan? I mean, one of these days they're going to find the  fairway, right?",west_wing
13861,bartlet,Would you pull the First Lady out of whatever she's in right now?,west_wing
13862,bartlet,"Well, put on a helmet and pads and get in there.",west_wing
13871,bartlet,No need to thank me. Whatever happened to Mrs. Wilburforce?,west_wing
13872,bartlet,What they hell are you talking about?,west_wing
13873,bartlet,Wasn't Mrs. Wilberforce our cat?,west_wing
13874,bartlet,Really? All right. Eisenmenger's Syndrome.,west_wing
13875,bartlet,The Ayatollah's son has it.,west_wing
13876,bartlet,"No, but I'm concerned about spousal abuse.",west_wing
13877,bartlet,The only doctor available won't do it.,west_wing
13878,bartlet,I can't order him to do it.,west_wing
13879,bartlet,Through the power vested in me by you?,west_wing
13880,bartlet,"Just for the record, this is why we don't talk about foreign policy. Which we do, and  you don't think we do it enough.",west_wing
13881,bartlet,Because Samuel Mudd was tried and convicted of treason for setting that leg.,west_wing
13882,bartlet,The patient right in front of them?,west_wing
13883,bartlet,All right. Go back to the sewing thing.,west_wing
13895,bartlet,"""The boy's on the plane. He's experiencing pulmonary hypertension."" That's elevated  pressure in the lungs, I think. That could lead to what? Doctor, that could lead to what?",west_wing
13896,bartlet,That cold lead to what?,west_wing
13897,bartlet,That's what it says here. Follow me.,west_wing
13898,bartlet,"That's right, and he has something called in situ thrombi.",west_wing
13899,bartlet,"Dr. Mohebi, I don't care. Why aren't you scrubbing up?",west_wing
13900,bartlet,I know this. Don't you think I know?,west_wing
13901,bartlet,I'll let you know who the enemy is. That's my job. It's not a 15-year-old boy.,west_wing
13902,bartlet,Doctors Without Borders.,west_wing
13903,bartlet,I do know these people. You're crazy if you don't think I do.,west_wing
13904,bartlet,Nothing will happen to them.,west_wing
13905,bartlet,Nothing will happen to them.,west_wing
13906,bartlet,"Well, the Swiss, I guess. Look, I'll use every power of the office to protect you and  your family, of course I will. Can I just say that this is how things change for the  better? A world-class surgeon or a schoolteacher in Afjah who questions the ayatollah's  divine power. Do me a favor, Doctor, go back to Smith-Lansing and look at the kid,  'cause I think when you do, you're going to scrub up. If you don't, I respect that,  and the man made his own bed. Okay?",west_wing
13907,bartlet,What was your father's name?,west_wing
13908,bartlet,Thank you. Get him to Baltimore.,west_wing
13922,bartlet,Is there another Democrat?,west_wing
13923,bartlet,And I know how you feel. You like Scott Holcomb?,west_wing
13924,bartlet,You're going to campaign on prescription drugs?,west_wing
13925,bartlet,It's okay to run away from me when you need to.,west_wing
13926,bartlet,I appreciate that but that's not what I'm talking about. You disagreed with me on  Medicare. I remember the meeting right here. Then you wrote a five-page memo. Run  towards yourself. I'm wrong about that. Walk. You're not going to be used to your  surroundings.,west_wing
13927,bartlet,"You lose, you lose, but if you waste this, I'll kill you. I'll just kill you, Sam.",west_wing
13928,bartlet,Yeah. I'm going to bed.,west_wing
13929,bartlet,I said thanks on the behalf of the ticket. I can't help it if...,west_wing
13930,bartlet,They'll thank whatever they want.,west_wing
13931,bartlet,I'm freezing it for us. We just won four more years. It's not time for a free-for-all.,west_wing
13932,bartlet,Do I call them all back?,west_wing
13933,bartlet,All right. Anything else?,west_wing
13934,bartlet,"Well, Mohebi's day just started.",west_wing
13936,bartlet,Uh-huh. I am a character in this story?,west_wing
13938,bartlet,I don't see being a character.,west_wing
13939,bartlet,Could have gone better. I didn't think adultery was against the uniform code.,west_wing
13940,bartlet,Yeah. It's against military law?,west_wing
13941,bartlet,For failure to follow an order?,west_wing
13942,bartlet,We shold have that here.,west_wing
13943,bartlet,"Good morning, Mr. Secretary, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the final Cabinet  meeting of Bartlet one. I don't know if this is true, but a Presidential historian  told me that this was the most stable cabinet since Hoover's. Which is nice, but you  got to think, how many other jobs were really available? But here are facts. You  created over nine million new jobs, and the highest home-ownership rate on record.  More than 150 new trade agreements. You created the largest expansion of college aid  since the GI Bill. Cleaned up over 500 toxic waste dumps. And you did it all while  eliminating 16,000 pages of federal regulations. Not bad for government work. Thank you.",west_wing
14030,bartlet,"Okay, thank you.  What the hell is going on with the seats in the briefing room?",west_wing
14032,bartlet,"I'm not worried about it, but I just read about it.",west_wing
14034,bartlet,I'll comment on it. I'll say sit your ass where you're told and get back to work.,west_wing
14036,bartlet,Okay.  We'll have to return.,west_wing
14037,bartlet," Anyway, you're going to take care of it?",west_wing
14039,bartlet,"Well, I'm sorry to hear you caving, but whatever.",west_wing
14041,bartlet,"Well, okay, but still, whatever.",west_wing
14042,bartlet,Thanks.  This is Jack Reese. He's working for Nancy. This is Josh  Lyman and C.J. Cregg.,west_wing
14043,bartlet,They're talking about a force level data-fusion network.,west_wing
14044,bartlet,Nancy thinks France will come around after the North Sea exercise.,west_wing
14045,bartlet,Okay. Thanks very much everybody.,west_wing
14062,bartlet,You're going to talk to Berryhill?,west_wing
14063,bartlet,He wants to feel loved.,west_wing
14064,bartlet,You'll make him feel loved? I want him in the Cabinet.,west_wing
14065,bartlet,You think we should get involved?,west_wing
14066,bartlet,"'Cause I got to tell you, I've been hearing it from Abbey and the girls.",west_wing
14067,bartlet,"No, I meant about Vickie Hilton.",west_wing
14068,bartlet,"Sure. Yes, but isn't there some question as to whether it's practical to give that order  in the first place?",west_wing
14069,bartlet,"No, I'm just saying there are few side to this.",west_wing
14070,bartlet,But we'll hear no others because we don't want it in the Oval Office.,west_wing
14084,bartlet,He's wrong. Leo's wrong. Are we to live with the assumption that there are no men  in the services who've commited adultery? I don't know what's worse: being stupid  or pretending to be stupid. Tell him that.,west_wing
14085,bartlet,"No, I'm going to do it.",west_wing
14086,bartlet,"Eisenhower and Kay Summersby, a subordinate. Hammond with the wives of two junior  officers. So, G.I. Jane gets a court-martial? G.I. Joe gets a short film on hygeine?  That is all I have to say to you. ",west_wing
14087,bartlet,I forgot to tell him something else.,west_wing
14088,bartlet,That's right. Because men don't give that order to other men.,west_wing
14089,bartlet,"The daughter of the president of Brazil, which presented a politcal prblem for me.  Also, I didn't fire him, I asked him to resign. And I set him up in the private sector.  And if you think the differnce is semantics, look up dishonorable discharge in there.  Look up Fort Leavenworth.",west_wing
14090,bartlet,I read the memo on Rwanda. Average rainfall nine inches. That's the memo Toby wanted  me to read?,west_wing
14091,bartlet," There are big signs! You can't park there! They should get towed! I hope  they get towed to Queens and the Triboro is closed and there's a big craft show at Shea,  a flea market or a tractor show! ",west_wing
14092,bartlet,Do you really think that Vicky Hilton is unable to distinguish between this order  and a combat order?,west_wing
14093,bartlet,"Well, you didn't let me finish.",west_wing
14094,bartlet,"I may also be right. We get five more people in here, I think we're going to have  eight opinions.",west_wing
14095,bartlet,"And two elections in a row, people said they wanted me to run that.",west_wing
14096,bartlet,"Right now, I'm not talking about overruling anyone or pardoning anyone. Right now,  I'm just talking about having people over and asking questions. I like basketball,  but I can't play. I don't know why. I played in prep school and I liked being on  the team, but I didn't want the ball and the coach said, ""Jed, winners always want  the ball."" I said, ""Coach, winners are also better then I am."" He said, ""Son, to  be a winner, you've got to think like a winner."" I said, ""Coach, to be a winner,  you've also got to be better than I am."" Anyway, he was right. Winners want the ball.  I don't think I ever want to hear it's too sticky for the Oval Office.  What are you smiling at?",west_wing
14097,bartlet,"Are we together on this? Do we have resolve? We've got four years, no election and a  Republican Congress that hates me and actually hates you more. You ready to saddle up?",west_wing
14098,bartlet,All right. Good then. Happy Thanksgiving.,west_wing
14153,bartlet,There's a new international math and science study. We rank 19 out of 21 countries.,west_wing
14154,bartlet,This is what I'm talking about.,west_wing
14155,bartlet,South Africa and Cyprus.,west_wing
14156,bartlet,"No, you don't. Nor us anymore, for that matter. One-third of all math teachers and half  of science teachers didn't major or minor in that subject.",west_wing
14157,bartlet,"And we'll want to get to the bottom of that. But we're increasing education spending to  over a $100 billion a year and, as a result, we have seventh grade textbooks being used  in ninth grade and the same answers get a higher score on S.A.T.s.",west_wing
14158,bartlet,Right. But I'm talking about children now.,west_wing
14159,bartlet,You don't want to know.,west_wing
14160,bartlet,"I got 800/790. For the life of me, I can't imagine what I got wrong. Then I took them  again, and got 800/790. I mean, is it possible there was some sort of number-two pencil  anomaly that could've...?",west_wing
14161,bartlet,"Yeah, I know, it's a little... something.",west_wing
14162,bartlet,"So our schools have reached a crisis and our infant mortality rate is two and a half  times what it is in Singapore. So what I think we should do for starters is, we should  keep more people alive, then send them to school. Get a little peace and prosperity going.",west_wing
14163,bartlet,"Stanley, the width and depth of what I haven't done about it yet... You know you can't  do anything about hurricanes? The President can't do anything about nature or bad luck.  I ought to be able to do something about the airplane.",west_wing
14164,bartlet,"Wait, what'd I just say?",west_wing
14165,bartlet,What do airplanes signify?,west_wing
14166,bartlet,"Stanley, I never thought to ask, but you are a doctor, right?",west_wing
14167,bartlet,I've been spacing out for a minute at meetings. Three times this week. I hear someone  talking and realize I wasn't listening to part of it.,west_wing
14168,bartlet,"And now we're one-third of the way through an Agatha Chrstie story.  ""Where  nobody be goin' nowhere. The bridge is washed out."" Well, I'm finished. But I was doing  the guy that says that in the Agatha Christie stories. Stanley, as always. Leo, I'll be  in the office.",west_wing
14191,bartlet,I want to see Josh in his office. Let him know I'm coming.,west_wing
14195,bartlet,"Listen, this is going to sound crazy but Olympia Buckland had an infant mortality  bill that we asked her not to take out of committee 'cause it was too expensive.",west_wing
14196,bartlet,I'd like her initiative or something similiar to be folded into the HHS budget.,west_wing
14198,bartlet,"No, I mean I want it for the next Congress. You understand what I'm saying?",west_wing
14200,bartlet,"A little bit, yeah. If we nip and tuck in different departments we can do it. It'll  take an around-the-clock kind of effort. Yes it's a holiday, but OMB works for us, right?",west_wing
14201,bartlet,You think this is crazy?,west_wing
14208,bartlet,"Okay. Well, I sent some notes on the Congressional section.",west_wing
14209,bartlet,Isn't that why you're here?,west_wing
14210,bartlet,I thought it was about the notes on the Congressional section.,west_wing
14211,bartlet,Okay. Would you like to come back with Toby?,west_wing
14212,bartlet,"Well, thanks for stopping by.",west_wing
14247,bartlet,He's the best-looking person I've ever seen in real life.,west_wing
14248,bartlet,"Yeah, that was a setback for the Bourbons. Listen...",west_wing
14249,bartlet,"Zoey, I think it's really sweet that you still come to me for permission. You're classy,  and you're old-fashioned.",west_wing
14250,bartlet,Not in a million years.,west_wing
14251,bartlet,Listen. Sit down for a second.,west_wing
14252,bartlet,"When you were little, like two, I really wanted you to like me and I wan't sure you did.  With Liz and Ellie, my act just worked and with you I had to try harder. ",west_wing
14253,bartlet,I did something a few months ago and I'm sure I was right and I'd do it again but it's  hard to live with. This is ridiculous. You're freezing. Come inside.,west_wing
14254,bartlet,"You know, why don't you go back to the Residence and make sure your mom hasn't killed  your boyfriend. Yeah, he can come to Manchester. He's going to have more Secret Service  stuff to do, and he's going to have to sleep in the root cellar which, like your bedroom  door, will be guarded round the clock by two U.S. Marshals.",west_wing
14255,bartlet,I almost told her. I've been feeling it a little lately. I've been exorcising my guilt  by having Josh crowbar infant mortality money into the HHS budget on December 23 at 8:00.,west_wing
14256,bartlet,Yeah. We'll figure it out.,west_wing
14257,bartlet,"Stanley thought it was weird that I took the SAT's again, too.",west_wing
14258,bartlet,You don't think it's possible that the remaining answer was important?,west_wing
14259,bartlet,How the hell would you know? You got 1400.,west_wing
14261,bartlet,"Yeah. Listen, my reasons for not wanting to talk about campaign reform at the  Inauguration are simple. It's not a legislative speech and when we cite issues,  it should be the ones that affect people's lives. You agree?",west_wing
14265,bartlet,"Okay, except when I asked you to come into the Oval Office you said, ""No, no, no.  No, no, no, no.""",west_wing
14266,bartlet,And you called me Mr. Justice.,west_wing
14300,bartlet,It's the curse of every daughter's father.,west_wing
14301,bartlet,I don't like them. I don't like them at all.,west_wing
14302,bartlet,What the hell happened with you two? It was perfect. I just kept you in the office  all the time.,west_wing
14303,bartlet,"That was the point. If I was trying to make her happy, I'd buy her a Cabriolet.",west_wing
14304,bartlet,C-Jean. Stable economies with free-flowing uranium don't make for a stable world  community. Did I make that point?,west_wing
14305,bartlet,Good. And is there a cow on my schedule today?,west_wing
14307,bartlet, I'm meeting with a cow. I shouldn't worry about it.,west_wing
14310,bartlet,How you doing? Good to see you. Great. Thank you. Thanks for coming. Thank you.  Thank you. Thank you very much. ,west_wing
14311,bartlet,Thank you. Thank you. Good to see you. How are you? How are you?,west_wing
14350,bartlet,We live in an interdependent world and we should act like it. We live in a global  community and we should sustain it. We should cross borders. We should cross borders  to build sustainable democracies that can banish privation and fear. And we should  cross borders to bring food and medicine and roads and schools and teachers to parts  of the world forgotten by all but the warlords. We're gonna pass this Foreign Ops  bill. This should be a century of hope and prosperity everywhere. And America is  going to lead the world and not just bully it. Thank you.,west_wing
14351,bartlet, What the hell is going on?,west_wing
14352,bartlet, What the hell is going on?,west_wing
14353,bartlet,Which is why we can't get her on the phone?,west_wing
14354,bartlet,"We have many, many backup plans in the works? Josh has broken people into teams and  they're developing and executing rapid-response backup plans?",west_wing
14355,bartlet,"Please, my daughter's dating a kid who's better-looking than my wife. I have only so  much RAM to give over to-- C.J.!",west_wing
14356,bartlet,"I'm sorry, but once again, there's a cow?",west_wing
14357,bartlet,"Yeah, I got that part. It was...",west_wing
14359,bartlet,And that's great. But a picture of me and a cow...,west_wing
14361,bartlet,Why did you agree to it in the first place?,west_wing
14364,bartlet,"Well, good luck with that. Now turn around casually and tell me if Le Vicomte de  Valvert has got his hands anywhere near anyone who's related to me.",west_wing
14366,bartlet,"Yeah, I think you'd respond if I stopped feeding you!",west_wing
14408,bartlet,"There are a couple of thousand miltary families on food stamps. I can't stand it;  the Pentagon knows it. Some families are eligible, some aren't. To change it, they'd  have to raise everyone's pay, which they can't do, and this memo's a reminder. It's a  get-off-our-backs memo. And you thought you were done with turf wars.",west_wing
14409,bartlet,You decommissioned two aircraft carriers.,west_wing
14410,bartlet,"Boy, Zoey's growing up nicely, isn't she?",west_wing
14411,bartlet,"I'm on your side in this thing, but just barely. Just by a little bit, because  he's French and royal. These are very special, very limited circumstances under  which we're allies, you and I.",west_wing
14412,bartlet,The letter from the rope line.,west_wing
14413,bartlet,Put it in my bag tonight.,west_wing
14414,bartlet,"Mr. McGarry, Mr. Ziegler, Mr. Lyman, Ms. Cregg. It's the Tepmtations. I love you guys.",west_wing
14416,bartlet,For an RV? What's he want?,west_wing
14417,bartlet,I like it. There should a button on my desk I can press and 49 people instantly  pray for me.,west_wing
14420,bartlet,"Well, that's the problem.",west_wing
14422,bartlet,"Okay, well, good news. Keep us posted on that.",west_wing
14424,bartlet,Is there something I should be doing I'm not doing?,west_wing
14426,bartlet,"Oh, wait. You guys didn't come in here to tell me something funny?",west_wing
14427,bartlet," You... you, are the wildcard, my friend, because you...",west_wing
14428,bartlet,"...because you will throw out the baby, the bathwater, and the bubbles at curtain  time if it means...",west_wing
14429,bartlet,Feel free to interrupt.,west_wing
14431,bartlet,"I don't care if they care! I care! And oh, by the way, so do you!",west_wing
14435,bartlet,"Well, in my faith, we've known it's worked for two thousand years. I never knew there  was data available, but okay.",west_wing
14437,bartlet,"Oh, I don't care. But what I was going to say...",west_wing
14439,bartlet,You're not willing to toss it overboard to win. You're willing to toss it overboard  to avoid disappointing Leo. You know what the difference is between you and me?  I want to be the guy. You want to be the guy the guy counts on.,west_wing
14443,bartlet,"When I lose, I don't look for consolation in the score and I know for sure you don't.  So, it's what we should do, right?",west_wing
14444,bartlet,"All right, tough beat. It's an unbelievably tough beat.",west_wing
14445,bartlet,"Hey, Zoey's growing up very nicely, isn't she?",west_wing
14472,bartlet,"Tough beat, everybody. Thanks for the work. Next time, we let Josh do it the way he wants.",west_wing
14474,bartlet,When's this thing with the cow?,west_wing
14476,bartlet,I don't know. I don't know everybody. C.J. wants to cancel the goat picture. Half the  world's people live on less than two dollars a day. 130 million will never step inside  a schoolhouse. Ingredients for bombs can be purchased at hardware stores and we've just  given the Third World what the doctor ordered: rollbacks. Heifer International... they  give free cows and goats to people who need milk?,west_wing
14477,bartlet,"Well, then, I don't think that we're in any position to be snotty. Let's do it...  Let's do it right now.",west_wing
14480,bartlet,"I'm not standing in this picture alone. This was a total team failure. Stand where you  want, but I want my Chief of Staff and my Chief Political Advisor standing near the goat.",west_wing
14481,bartlet,Let's go.  Set that clock for 90 days.,west_wing
14597,bartlet,Why are they talking to me about the order of the balls?,west_wing
14601,bartlet,"Well, that's only going to be clear if we also hand out decoder rings. Listen, it's  an Inauguration Ball. Let's enjoy ourselves.",west_wing
14602,bartlet,"Thanks, ladies and gentlemen.",west_wing
14605,bartlet,You haven't weighed in.,west_wing
14609,bartlet,"Well, their curiosity will be slacked in about 41 minutes. Listen.",west_wing
14611,bartlet,"All right, two problems.",west_wing
14612,bartlet,"I kept changing my mind all week on which bible I wanted to use, and then I finally  settled on the George Washington Bible but we ran into a problem with the New York  Freemasons, which we don't have time to get into.",west_wing
14613,bartlet,"Yeah. Charlie's out hunting one down, but he's not back yet.",west_wing
14616,bartlet,You think that's a good idea?,west_wing
14621,bartlet,"Yeah, I may need to get a room.",west_wing
14622,bartlet,"No kidding. In the last two minutes, three people have reminded me what Jefferson  said in his Inaugural.",west_wing
14623,bartlet,"The problem is that when he said it, your best chance of getting entangled with an  ally was by rowboat.",west_wing
14624,bartlet,They didn't have one in the House Library?,west_wing
14627,bartlet,And will there be someone who'll tell me when it's time to do that?,west_wing
14628,bartlet, Can we pull foreign policy up on the prompter?,west_wing
14633,bartlet,What are you talking about?,west_wing
14635,bartlet,"""Fear of cancer from asbestos, fuzzy science manifestos.""",west_wing
14640,bartlet,"""America cannot be the world's policeman. America cannot enforce its own values, its  own standards across the world. Yet when it's in our clear an vital interests...""  We're being candid at least.",west_wing

14645,bartlet,The Chief Justice wrote a poem.,west_wing
14646,bartlet,You think he stayed to long at the fair?,west_wing
14647,bartlet,This foreign policy language is ridiculous.,west_wing
14648,bartlet,What's going on in Khundu?,west_wing
14649,bartlet,"I got a short security cable this morning about civil unrest in the Republic of  Equatorial Khundu, and I had to reach for an atlas.",west_wing
14650,bartlet,They're being evacuated?,west_wing
14651,bartlet,And they need several days notice?,west_wing
14652,bartlet,Are they not sure where it is?,west_wing
14653,bartlet,I'm going to be using the Bartlet Bible. That's at the New Hampshire Historical Society.,west_wing
14654,bartlet,"I can't remember your name, but are you asking me out on a date?",west_wing
14662,bartlet,"No, he was talking to me, your Eminence.  Your Excellency, I got a very  sketchy intelligence report on the violence in the capitol about an hour ago.",west_wing
14670,bartlet,Just as the disciples intended.,west_wing
14671,bartlet,The Jefferson bible doesn't warp?,west_wing
14672,bartlet,"Probably. Speaking of New Hampshire, don't I own the Bartlet Bible?",west_wing
14673,bartlet,And they won't loan it back to me so that I can be inaugurated?,west_wing
14674,bartlet,Yeah. His name is really Mr. Cravenly? You're not making that up?,west_wing
14675,bartlet,"Okay, would you tell him that I'd like very much to use my family's Bible, which my  family has bought at least twice now.",west_wing
14676,bartlet,"You know, a couple hundred people got killed today in Khundu.",west_wing
14677,bartlet,The Arkutu control the government and they're killing...,west_wing
14678,bartlet,Yeah. Ask Bob Slattery to come over here.,west_wing
14685,bartlet,"Bobby, what's going on?",west_wing
14686,bartlet,The Catholic Church has better intelligence than we do?,west_wing
14687,bartlet,How many are dead right now?,west_wing
14688,bartlet,"Bobby, I don't want to make noise but I want to see a forced depletion report.  I want to know how many we'd lose and I want to do it without going three rounds  in the newspaper with Miles Hutchison. Who do we have at the Pentagon who could  do this for us?",west_wing
14689,bartlet,Tell him I want to see forced depletion on a peacekeeping force in Khundu. And tell  him we'll do our best to keep it away from the Secretary's office.,west_wing
14699,bartlet,"Hey, I changed my mind about the Bible.",west_wing
14700,bartlet,I don't know. I never... it just seems parochial. I hate saying that.,west_wing
14701,bartlet,"There's a Bible in North Hampton, Masachusetts, that Johnathon Edwards used. Let's  get that.",west_wing
14702,bartlet,"""Grace is but glory begun and glory is but grace perfected."" I made my Bible selection.",west_wing
14703,bartlet,And I'm worried about the White House making that suggestion.,west_wing
14704,bartlet,"All right, listen. I've asked for a forced depletion report on action in Khundu.",west_wing
14705,bartlet,Slatterly got Jack Reese.,west_wing
14706,bartlet,"The best scenario is that simply by engaging, the Arkutu lay down their weapons,  but that doesn't seem likey, so we'd lose people.",west_wing
14707,bartlet,More if they go into the countryside.,west_wing
14724,bartlet,"The First Lady has to hold this in her hand. This one's going to take the First Lady,  the Chief Justice and the Second Circuit Court of Appeals.",west_wing
14725,bartlet,"Sorry. Thanks. Charlie's going to take care of you.  Charlie, that Bible's  the size of a Volkswagon. Can we get the Washington Bible?",west_wing
14726,bartlet,Toby been taking his pants off again? That's just something he does.,west_wing
14727,bartlet,Yeah. What's hard is that foreign policy has become a statement of what we won't do.,west_wing
14728,bartlet,"""A new doctrine for a new century, based not just on our interests, but on our  values across the world."" Well, that's pretty spicey stuff.",west_wing
14729,bartlet,"Yeah, I know. Why is a Khundunese life worth less to me than an American life?",west_wing
14730,bartlet,Talk about the very model of a modern Major General.,west_wing
14745,bartlet,We'll send condolences. What's next?,west_wing
14746,bartlet,"Well, if he's old enough to marry Jerry Lee Lewis, I guess he's old enough to be  king of Bhutan. What's next?",west_wing
14747,bartlet,"What's happening? I'm sorry, what's happening in the REK?",west_wing
14748,bartlet,"Well, a proclamation ought to do the trick. What's the CIA know that I should know?",west_wing
14749,bartlet,"Yeah. Hey, I changed my mind. Not the Washington Bible.",west_wing
14750,bartlet,"Yeah, I'm going to use my father's.",west_wing
14751,bartlet,Did you talk to Hutchinson?,west_wing
14752,bartlet," Tell Josh I'll just be a minute, okay?",west_wing
14753,bartlet,Did he tell me to shut up and let him run the Pentagon?,west_wing
14754,bartlet,So Hutchinson know I've seen forced depletion.,west_wing
14755,bartlet,"He should be pissed at me, not Jack Reese.",west_wing
14756,bartlet,Don't worry about it. Right?,west_wing
14757,bartlet,Clark says neighbors are swapping family members in Khundu.,west_wing
14758,bartlet,"Also, there's a new king of Bhutan. And he's been bar mitzvaed and everything.",west_wing

14760,bartlet,"Yeah, he was using a floor speech about El Salvador I gave 98 years ago to demonstrate  that the U.S. should send troops to Khundu. Rhetorically, I said, ""Why is a Khundunese  life worth less to me than an American life?"" And he said, ""I dont know, sir, but it is.""",west_wing
14762,bartlet,"Hey, Josh. There's intelligence that Khundunese neighbors in the country are swapping  family members.",west_wing
14764,bartlet,"For the night, they're swapping family members you know, and sleeping in each other's  houses.",west_wing

14835,bartlet,What do the Freemasons have to do with it?,west_wing
14836,bartlet,Are you trying to tell me that Freemasons don't like me?,west_wing
14837,bartlet,I saw C.J. smiling before. Has something good happened?,west_wing

And so we are for freedom from tyranny everywhere, whether in the guise of  political oppresion, Toby, or economic slavery, Josh, or religious fanaticism, C.J.  That most fundamental idea cannot be met with merely our support. It has to be met with  our strength. Diplomatically, economically, materially. And if pharoah still don't free  the slaves, then he gets the plagues, or my cavalry, whichever gets there first. The  USTR will go crazy and say that we're not considering global trade. Committee members  will go crazy and say I haven't consulted enough. And the Arab world will just go  indescriminately crazy.

An hour ago, I ordered Fitzwallace to  have UCOMM deploy a brigade of the 82nd Airborne, the 101st Air Assualt, and a Marine  Expeditionary Unit to Khundu to stop the violence.

The light that indicates  that the landing gear is locked didn't go on, which usually indicates that there's  something wrong with the light.

15560,bartlet,The fly-by's going to take about an hour and 15 minutes. Would you tell C.J.?,west_wing
15573,bartlet,"Right, but at the moment, I'm more concerned with our credibility. He told me at the  Summit of the Americas that he'd work toward crop diversification. Did he mean opium  and coke?",west_wing
15574,bartlet,"Yes, but he's not helping us, so why should I give him political cover? Listen, I'm  serious. What would happen if I don't recertify Columbia?",west_wing
15575,bartlet,Why?  Because the deadline was midnight...,west_wing
15576,bartlet,The actual signed paper?,west_wing
15577,bartlet,This is really how the world works.,west_wing
15578,bartlet,I want this plane to land!,west_wing
15628,bartlet,Why are you so eager to get in this game?,west_wing
15629,bartlet,"This is a cash game, Debbie. These are hard working people blowing off some steam and  taking each other off their coin. We don't play for matchsticks and we don't play... ",west_wing
15630,bartlet,"...Okay, can I ask you something? I forgot to have Charlie to draw cash for me, can you  float me a little?",west_wing
15631,bartlet,"Leo, C.J. swears that on the equinox, which is today, you can stand an egg on end.",west_wing
15632,bartlet,Well that's why these are unmanned right? All we lost was money? Aren't they saying  detonate the plane?,west_wing
15633,bartlet,"Well, what do they want me to do, call Chigorin and ask if we can go in and get our  spy plane back?",west_wing
15634,bartlet,"Wait, you're serious. They want me to call Chigorin?",west_wing
15635,bartlet,And ask him for the plane back without telling him we were spying?,west_wing
15636,bartlet,"Yeah, this isn't going to work.",west_wing
15638,bartlet,You were full of crap. You had jack-high or something?,west_wing
15639,bartlet,"Hang on. Will, why are you dressed like an officer in the Air Force?",west_wing
15640,bartlet,I didn't know that.  Did you know that?,west_wing
15642,bartlet,I had no idea. What do you do?,west_wing
15643,bartlet,And this is your weekend up?,west_wing
15644,bartlet,Well good for you. Where are you stationed?,west_wing
15645,bartlet,Are we getting somewhere?,west_wing
15646,bartlet,"And what do I do when Chigorin tells me that Hawaii's not really part of America, and  he wants to change the alphabet to Cyrillic?",west_wing
15647,bartlet,What area are we trolling in?,west_wing
15648,bartlet,We were spying for him?,west_wing
15649,bartlet,"Okay, this phone call you're going to set up with Chigorin...it's like for a White  House bloopers reel or something?",west_wing
15669,bartlet," But President Bartlet, we have a terrific search-and-recovery team.  We'll just go get that plane for you.",west_wing
15670,bartlet,"""Our folks""? You really think I'd use those words with the Russian President?",west_wing
15672,bartlet,"""Much as I have to protect Kaliningrad, sir, which brings us to the question of what  the hell were you doing flying over it?""",west_wing
15673,bartlet,What was the other mission?,west_wing
15674,bartlet,I tell him it was an environmental mission?,west_wing
15675,bartlet,"Okay, and he's not going to want to take pictures of coastal erosion at Coney Island?",west_wing
15676,bartlet,We were on an environmental mission for Finland?,west_wing
15677,bartlet,That's what we've come up with?,west_wing
15692,bartlet,"Let's go.  Mr. President, this is President Bartlet.",west_wing
15693,bartlet,"Okay, you know what, I'm going to have to call you back.",west_wing
15694,bartlet," Bamboo, they want me to get into the motorcade.",west_wing
15695,bartlet,I was on the phone with Chigorin. ,west_wing
15696,bartlet,He's got code word clearance. ,west_wing
15697,bartlet,Was anyone in the room? ,west_wing
15698,bartlet," Will, how many fingers am I holding up?",west_wing
15699,bartlet,"I don't know if you've met Ron Butterfield, the head of my detail.",west_wing
15700,bartlet,"But if he's heard what happened, he's going to be trying to get here...",west_wing
15701,bartlet,"No, I'm telling you that if Charlie heard there were bullets, he's going to overpower  whoever's trying to...",west_wing
15702,bartlet,"It's bulletproof glass in the windows, okay. You want to kill me, you're going to have  to do it from inside the building.",west_wing
15703,bartlet,"I'm surprised your guys managed to keep Fiderer in her chair. I would have thought she'd  be the first one through the d... No, here we are.",west_wing
15704,bartlet,"No one was hurt, someone shot at the press briefing room from the sidewalk.",west_wing
15705,bartlet,"Will's sitting right outside, and Toby and C.J. are standing right there. ",west_wing
15706,bartlet,"This was just a crazy guy, Leo.",west_wing
15741,bartlet,You guys playing again?,west_wing
15743,bartlet,"President Chigorin, it's Jed Bartlet again. I'm sorry about being abrupt before, but I  bet if you turn on CNN international right now you'll see...",west_wing
15744,bartlet,"Yeah, there you go. It's not a big deal, but they shut us down for a little bit.",west_wing
15745,bartlet,By the way when they crash the building they don't crash all of it. The Situation Room  still works.,west_wing
15746,bartlet,"Mr. President, a little while ago an unmanned B-UAV drone crashed, we think somewhere  inside Kaliningrad, as a matter of fact. Apparently they don't respond, you know, quite  the way you'd like when there's a sudden shift in the weather.",west_wing
15747,bartlet,"Well, like I say, it was a UAV, it was taking satellite pictures of coastal erosion in  the Baltic Sea. The Finns know about this. We'd like to send a special operations team  ten kilometres west of Borsakova to retrieve it.",west_wing
15748,bartlet,Are you getting that translation right?,west_wing
15749,bartlet,"You campaigned on the environment, Mr. President. Coastal erosion in the Baltic Sea. ",west_wing
15750,bartlet,"Well, the problem is our UAV's have a self-detonating capability and our people know  how to disarm it, and I wouldn't want to put your guys at risk.",west_wing
15751,bartlet,"It's proprietary technology, Peter.",west_wing
15752,bartlet,This isn't working anymore.,west_wing
15771,bartlet,"I understand. I meant...  I wasn't referring to the change in weather, sir.",west_wing
15772,bartlet,We were taking pictures of Kaliningrad.,west_wing
15773,bartlet,"We were taking pictures of Kaliningrad. We take pictures of black market nuclear materials  being moved out the back doors of suppositories and into trucks. The materials are being  sold to non-governmental elements and, well, that's what we were doing. Rogue engineers,  military scientists, and ex-KGB. It's just as big of a problem for you as it is for us,  but you're not dealing with it, so we were taking pictures of Kaliningrad. We're going to  have to trust each other a little Peter. So we're going to share the pictures we got. Not  the technology we used to get them. Otherwise I'm detonating it and neither of us see the  pictures. We're going to have to trust each other. Our two countries have stopped the world  from annihilating itself for 60 years because of conversations like this one. Why don't you  talk it over?",west_wing
15774,bartlet,"If he calls back we'll have a deal. In the mean time, one hand. Bring your wallet.",west_wing
15794,bartlet,"Hurry it up. They're going to call us back in a second. Debbie, do something.",west_wing
15795,bartlet,Thank you. Is the pastrami from Krupins?,west_wing
15805,bartlet,"Uh, it turns out it has to go to the Secretary of State. There's a law: It's 3-USC-20.  It goes to the Secretary of State. But we'll take care of it.",west_wing
15806,bartlet,Why did you take a cab?,west_wing
15807,bartlet,You know what's in here? ,west_wing
15910,bartlet,You've talked to Suzanne?,west_wing
15911,bartlet,You've talked to Suzanne?,west_wing
15912,bartlet,"If we're going to do this, we got to start tonight, now, and I need you thinking now  and not giving up...",west_wing
15913,bartlet,"What about ""It's none of your business?""",west_wing
15914,bartlet,"Apologize and move on. Accept responsibilty. You don't need to disclose details. She's  going to take care of that for you. You're going to be the dinner special for two months,  and then you've got two and half years to get the nomination.",west_wing
15915,bartlet,"In the middle of MS, it looked like we were never going to recover, and we did.",west_wing
15916,bartlet,"Well, I'm sorry, Mr. Vice President, if my multiple sclerosis was a bummer for your  sex life. How the hell did you do this to us?! You can't resign, John. It's a terrible  signal to send.",west_wing
15917,bartlet,"Is there more? Is there another shoe, 'cause if it's a series of...",west_wing
15918,bartlet,Didn't you have any sense that this was the kind of person who would do this?,west_wing
15919,bartlet,"Well, I want you to sleep on it. I want all of us to sleep on it.",west_wing
15920,bartlet,Why did you take a cab?,west_wing
15921,bartlet,You know what's in here? ,west_wing

15939,bartlet,We're going to work on that?,west_wing
15940,bartlet,Threat Con Bravo. Find them. Threat Con Bravo. Leo and I will be back.,west_wing
15950,bartlet,"Yeah, listen, I don't think this is going to come as a galloping shock to anyone here,  but last May I ordered a Special Ops unit to kill Abdul Shareef, and that's what they  did, and we we made it look like what got reported.",west_wing
15951,bartlet,"See, I said we took Shareef, and they said fine, and then you went on talking for  another five, ten minutes.",west_wing
15953,bartlet,"Well, I just ordered Threat Con Bravo, so people are going to be seeing some heightened  security this weekend.",west_wing
15957,bartlet,"Oh, hey, Toby, big day.",west_wing
15958,bartlet,"The house, a masterstroke. Come on, give us a kiss.",west_wing
15959,bartlet,"Well, it's been said that I have a pleasant speaking voice and oratorical style.",west_wing
15960,bartlet,"Yeah, right away I would think.",west_wing
15961,bartlet,"Except at this minute, I have to go over and meet the agents who are beening detailed  to Zoey for France. They speak French. As well as being secret service agents. I didn't  mean they speak French and so therefore are guarding Zoey in France.",west_wing
15962,bartlet,"I have been thinking that I'd like to talk about creativity. Why don't you get started  on some thoughts, and I'll join you.",west_wing
15965,bartlet,Are you friends of Zoey's?,west_wing
15966,bartlet,"Wes, thanks so much for doing this. I know it's not what you like.",west_wing
15967,bartlet,"So, let's talk about how this is going to work.",west_wing
15968,bartlet,"Well, here's my question. These guys look pretty young to me, and I'm looking for  something very specific with this detail. This is a father-daughter situation, and  so what I think I'm looking for in terms of protection would best be categorized as,  well, overwhelming force. Do they have that? Do they have the ability to just overwhelm  any danger that might...? Do you have overwh...? Do they have overwhelming force?",west_wing
15969,bartlet,This one here tossed Wesley like a bag of potato chips.,west_wing
15970,bartlet,You guys know each other?,west_wing
15971,bartlet,"Oh, good. Okay. Well, Ellie's still up and running.",west_wing
15972,bartlet, Are you going back to the campus?,west_wing
15973,bartlet,"Okay, well, let me ask you this. Would you consider instead of living in France with  your boyfriend for three months, staying here, living in your room, being a candy  striper, or surfer?",west_wing
15974,bartlet,"Or surfing? You could spend the summer working in a pet shop. We could play Yahtzee,  and watch movies at night.",west_wing
15975,bartlet,What daughters would do their whole lives if I had my way.,west_wing
15976,bartlet," Before I forget, if something comes up and you're faced with the choice  of killing the boyfriend or not killing the boyfriend -- kill the boyfriend.",west_wing
15977,bartlet,What are we doing on the ground?,west_wing
15978,bartlet,How long have they been at it?,west_wing
15979,bartlet,"All right, let's give them another hour. Then have the Coast Gurad close the port.  Is it the port of Portland? Is it really the port of Portland?",west_wing
15980,bartlet,They're going to lose $700 million a day 'cause these five guys are missing. And I  just now got why we're having this meeting.,west_wing
15981,bartlet,Portland. Torrential rain in the Pacific Northwest.,west_wing
15982,bartlet,Screw the hour. Let's close it down.,west_wing
15983,bartlet,"Well, it's about the last thing they're going to get to decide. So you choose Tuesday.  20 years later, look what happens.",west_wing
16018,bartlet,Good! You're here! I want to make some changes.,west_wing
16019,bartlet,Look at you. There is no way you have three adult children.,west_wing
16020,bartlet,"Eh, it seems empty to me. Attention should be drawn to it.",west_wing
16021,bartlet,"Nice job with the, you know, raising of the kid.",west_wing
16022,bartlet,"They're real, too. They can cut glass.",west_wing
16023,bartlet,"Aw, damn it, what are these, then?",west_wing
16024,bartlet,Yeah. Get in the car. We'll do it on the fly.,west_wing
16025,bartlet,"Small ones-- instead of talking about the internal muse, I want to talk about the limits  of reason, and about passion and intuition in American life.",west_wing
16026,bartlet,"You can eat them, too. They're gumballs. Coop?",west_wing
16037,bartlet,What do you think about using the Eudora Welty quote instead of the Gandhi?,west_wing
16038,bartlet,"""You must be the change"" - is that it? ""You must be the change you wish to see in the  world."" Sounds too much like Eastern philosophy.",west_wing
16039,bartlet,'Cause Ghandi lived in India?,west_wing
16040,bartlet,"Well, let's write that one.",west_wing
16041,bartlet,"Yeah. Thanks, Will, for the help.",west_wing
16042,bartlet,"Yeah, no. I've got it down here in this folder, and on some napkins in my pocket.",west_wing
16043,bartlet,"Oh, yeah, I'll be fine. You know, unless something comes up.",west_wing
16044,bartlet,"Well, for instance, I just realized I don't have access to my pockets anymore. But,  you know, what are you going to do?",west_wing
18,Jack,What d?ye say to three shillings? and we forget the name?\,pirates
19,Jack,I?m terribly sorry. I,pirates

23,Jack,"Smith. Or Smithy, if you like.\",pirates
24,Jack,"Well, then, I confess, it is my intention to commandeer one of these ships, pick up a crew in Tortuga,  raid, pillage, plunder and otherwise pilfer my weasely black guts out!\",pirates
25,Jack,"Unless, of course, he knew you wouldn?t believe the truth even if he told it to you.\",pirates
27,Jack,&#160;?and then they made me their chief.\,pirates
28,Jack,Will you be saving her then?\,pirates
29,Jack,\,pirates
30,Jack,Move! \,pirates
31,Jack,Clearly you?ve never been to Singapore .  Where did you get that?\,pirates
34,Jack,"Captain Jack Sparrow , if you please, sir.\",pirates
35,Jack,I?m in the market as it were.\,pirates
36,Jack,But you have heard of me. \,pirates
39,Jack,Though it seems enough to condemn him.\,pirates
40,Jack,Finally. \,pirates
41,Jack,"I knew you?d warm up to me. Commodore Norrington, my effects, please, and my hat. Commodore! Elizabeth . It is Elizabeth isn?t it?\",pirates
43,Jack,"Miss Swann , if you?d be so kind. Come, come, dear. We don?t have all day. Now if you?d be very kind.  Easy on the goods, darling.\",pirates
45,Jack,"Sticks and stones, love. I saved your life, you save mine, we?re square. Gentlemen, m?lady, you will always remember this as the day that you almost caught Captain Jack Sparrow&#160;! \",pirates
46,Jack,\,pirates
48,Jack,You seem somewhat familiar. Have I threatened you before?\,pirates
50,Jack,"Ah, well, then it would be a shame to put a black mark on your record. So, if you'll excuse me?  Do you think this wise, boy&#160;? crossing blades with a pirate?\",pirates
52,Jack,Only a little. \,pirates
54,Jack,"You need to find yourself a girl, mate! Or perhaps the reason you practice three hours a day is that you already found one and are otherwise incapable of wooing said strumpet. You're not a eunuch, are you? \",pirates
56,Jack,Pirate!  Move away.\,pirates
58,Jack,,pirates
60,Jack,This shot is,pirates

66,Jack,"No survivors? Then where do the stories come from, I wonder?\",pirates
75,Jack,\,pirates
76,Jack,"Worry about your own fortunes, gentlemen. The deepest circle of Hell is reserved for betrayers and mutineers.  So there is a curse. That?s interesting.\",pirates
77,Jack,That?s very interesting.\,pirates
93,Jack,Aye.\,pirates
95,Jack,I?ve,pirates
97,Jack,,pirates
99,Jack,Why ask,pirates
101,Jack,And,pirates
103,Jack,"Oh, so it is that you?ve found a girl. I see. Well, if you?re intending to brave all, hasten to her rescue and so win fair lady?s heart you?ll have to do it alone, mate. I see",pirates
105,Jack,How?s that? The key?s run off.\,pirates
107,Jack,What?s your name?\,pirates
109,Jack,"That will be short for William , I imagine. Good, strong name. No doubt, named for your father, eh?\",pirates
111,Jack,"Uh-huh. Well, Mr. Turner , I?ve changed me mind. If you spring me from this cell I swear on pain of death I shall take you to the Black Pearl and your bonny lass. Do we have an accord?\",pirates
113,Jack,Agreed. Get me out.\,pirates
115,Jack,Not without my effects.\,pirates
117,Jack,"Commandeer. We?re going to commandeer that ship. Nautical term. One question about your business, boy, or there?s no use going. This girl&#160;? how far are you willing to go to save her?\",pirates
119,Jack,"Oh, good. No worries, then.\",pirates
121,Jack,It?s remarkable how often those two traits coincide.  Everyone stay calm! we are taking over the ship.\,pirates
123,Jack,Son?I?m Captain Jack Sparrow. Savvy?\,pirates
125,Jack,"Thank you, Commodore, for getting us ready to make way. We?d have had a hard time of it by ourselves.\",pirates
127,Jack,Is that so?\,pirates
129,Jack,I knew&#160;?im. Probably one the few who knew him as William Turner . Everyone else just called him Bootstrap or Bootstrap Bill.\,pirates
131,Jack,Good man. Good pirate. I swear you look just like him.\,pirates
133,Jack,"He was a bloody pirate, a scallywag.\",pirates
135,Jack,"Put it away, son. It?s not worth you getting beat again.\",pirates
137,Jack,"Then that's not much incentive for me to fight fair, then, is it?   can you sail under the command of a pirate? Or can you not?\",pirates
139,Jack,"Tortuga .  More importantly, it is indeed a sad life that has never breathed deep this sweet, proliferous bouquet that is Tortuga , savvy? What do you think?\",pirates
141,Jack,"I?ll tell you mate, if every town in the world were like this one, no man would ever feel unwanted.\",pirates
142,Jack,Scarlett&#160;!  Not sure I deserved that. Giselle! \,pirates
143,Jack,What?  I may have deserved that. \,pirates
144,Jack,"Ah, fortunately I know how to counter it. The man who did the waking buys, the man who was sleeping, a drink. The man who was sleeping drinks it while listening to a proposition from the man who did the waking.\",pirates
146,Jack,\,pirates
147,Jack,"I?m going after the Black Pearl.  I know where it?s going to be, and I?m going to take it.\",pirates
148,Jack,That?s why I know what Barbossa is up to. All I need is a crew.\,pirates
149,Jack,"Well, then I?d say it?s a very good thing I?m not a fool then, eh?\",pirates
150,Jack,"Let?s just say it?s a matter of leverage, eh? \",pirates
151,Jack,"That is the child of Bootstrap Bill Turner. His only child, savvy?\",pirates
152,Jack,One can only hope. Take what you can? \,pirates
160,Jack,"You, sailor!\",pirates

167,Jack,"No, that one I deserved.\",pirates
168,Jack,Actually -  borrowed. Borrowed without permission. But with every intention of bringing it back to you.\,pirates

171,Jack,A better one!\,pirates
173,Jack,"What one? That one?! Aye, that one. What say you?\",pirates
174,Jack,It?d be far worse not to have her.\,pirates
176,Jack,She can hold a bit longer.\,pirates
177,Jack,We?re catching up.\,pirates
185,Jack,Human hair?from my back. Let go of the anchor!\,pirates
186,Jack,Young Mr. Turner and I are to go ashore.\,pirates
187,Jack,Keep to the code.\,pirates
188,Jack,Pirate?s Code. Any man that falls behind?is left behind.\,pirates
190,Jack,"You know, for having such a bleak outlook on pirates you?re well on your way to becoming one. Sprung a man from jail, commandeered a ship of the Fleet, sailed with a buccaneer crew out of Tortuga &#160;?and you?re completely obsessed with treasure.\",pirates
192,Jack,"Not all treasure is silver and gold, mate.\",pirates
195,Jack,Not yet. We wait for the opportune moment.\,pirates
197,Jack,"May I ask you something? Have I ever given you reason not to trust me? Do us a favor&#160;? I know it?s difficult for you, but please stay here and try not to do anything stupid.\",pirates

202,Jack,Parley! That?s the one. Parley! Parley!\,pirates

209,Jack,"The girl?s blood didn?t work, did it?\",pirates
210,Jack,I know whose blood ye need.\,pirates
223,Jack,"No. I expect to leave you standing on some beach with absolutely no name at all, watching me sail away on my ship and then I?ll shout the name back to you. Savvy?\",pirates
224,Jack,"Of the two of us, I am the only one who hasn't committed mutiny, therefore?my word is the one we'll be trusting. Although?I suppose I should be thanking you because, in fact, if you hadn?t betrayed me and left me to die, I would have an equal share in that curse, same as you. \",pirates
225,Jack,"I?m having a thought here, Barbossa. What say we run up a flag of truce? I scurry over to the Interceptor, and I negotiate the return of your medallion, eh? What say you to that?\",pirates

243,Jack,That?s not very nice. Where?s the medallion?\,pirates
245,Jack,Ahh. Where?s dear William&#160;?\,pirates
248,Jack,\,pirates
251,Jack,You?re welcome.\,pirates
257,Jack,Don?t do anything stupid.\,pirates
259,Jack,Like that.\,pirates
260,Jack,"No one. He?s no one. A distant cousin of my aunt?s nephew twice removed. Lovely singing voice, though&#160;? eunuch.\",pirates
266,Jack,I always liked you.\,pirates
268,Jack,I?d really rather hoped we were past all this.\,pirates
269,Jack,I did notice.\,pirates
270,Jack,"Last time, you left me a pistol with one shot.\",pirates
271,Jack,"Seeing as there?s two of us, a gentleman?would give us a pair of pistols.\",pirates
272,Jack,That?s the second time I?ve had to watch that man sail away with my ship.\,pirates
274,Jack,"To what point and purpose, young missy? The Black Pearl is gone and unless you have a rudder and a lot of sails hidden in that bodice&#160;? unlikely - young Mr. Turner will be dead long before you can reach him.\",pirates
276,Jack,"Last time?I was here a grand total of three days, all right? Last time \",pirates
278,Jack,"Welcome to the Caribbean , love. \",pirates
279,Jack,"I love this song! Really bad eggs! Ooh.  When I get the Pearl back, I?m gonna teach it to the whole crew, and we?ll sing it all the time!\",pirates
281,Jack,"Not just the Spanish Main , love. The entire ocean. The entire wo?ld. Wherever we want to go, we?ll go. That?s what a ship is, you know. It?s not just a keel and a hull and a deck and sails that's what a ship needs but what a ship is?what the Black Pearl really is?is freedom.\",pirates
283,Jack,"Oh, yes.  But the company is infinitely better than last time, I think. The scenery has definitely improved.\",pirates
285,Jack,"I know exactly what you mean, love. \",pirates
287,Jack,"To the Black Pearl .  No! Not good! Stop! Not good! What are you doing? You burned all the food, the shade! The rum!\",pirates
289,Jack,Why is the rum gone?\,pirates
291,Jack,But why is the rum gone?\,pirates
293,Jack,There?ll be no living with her after this.\,pirates
297,Jack,"If I may be so bold as to inject my professional opinion. The Pearl was listing near to scuppers after the battle. It?s very unlikely she?ll be able to make good time. Think about it. The Black Pearl . The last real pirate threat in the Caribbean , mate. How can you pass that up?\",pirates
300,Jack,"A wedding! I love weddings?drinks all around!  I know.&#160;?Clap him in irons,? right?\",pirates
301,Jack,Inescapably clear.\,pirates
303,Jack,"Not if you?re the one doing the ambushing. I go in, I convince Barbossa to send his men out with their little boats. You and your mates return to the Dauntless and blast the bejesus outta them with your little cannons, eh?  What do you have to lose?\",pirates
304,Jack,"Now, to be quite honest with you, there?s still a slight risk for those aboard the Dauntless which includes the future Mrs. Commodore .\",pirates
307,Jack,Beg your pardon.\,pirates
308,Jack,Excuse me.\,pirates
310,Jack,Not probable.\,pirates
312,Jack,"She?s safe, just like I promised. She's all set to marry Norrington, just like she promised. And you get to die for her, just like you promised. So we're all men of our word really except for Elizabeth who is, in fact, a woman.\",pirates
313,Jack,"You don?t want to be doing that, mate.\",pirates
314,Jack,Your funeral.\,pirates
315,Jack,"Well, because &#160;?because the HMS Dauntless, pride of the Royal Navy, is floating just offshore. Waiting for you.\",pirates
316,Jack,"Just hear me out, mate. You order your men to row out to the Dauntless. They do what they do best. Robert&#160;?s your Uncle, Fannie&#160;?s your Aunt, there you are with two ships. The makings of your very own fleet.&#160;?Course you?ll take the grandest as your flagship, and who?s to argue? But what of the Pearl&#160;? Name me Captain, I?ll sail under your colors, I?ll give you ten percent of me plunder and you get to introduce yourself as?Commodore Barbossa. Savvy?\",pirates
317,Jack,"No, no, not at all by all means, kill the whelp. Just not yet. Wait to lift the curse until the opportune moment. For instance? \",pirates
319,Jack,Yeah.\,pirates
320,Jack,Fifteen.\,pirates
321,Jack,Twenty-five. And I?ll buy you the hat. A really big one?Commodore.\,pirates
322,Jack,All hand?s to the boats!  Apologies. You give the orders.\,pirates
323,Jack,Not to the boats? \,pirates
324,Jack,"Me? I'm dishonest. And a dishonest man you can always trust to be dishonest. Honestly. It's the honest ones you want to watch out for, because you can never predict when they're going to do something incredibly? stupid. \",pirates
325,Jack,Sorry.\,pirates
326,Jack,Or you could surrender.\,pirates
331,Jack,\,pirates
335,Jack,"If you were waiting for the opportune moment?that was it. Now, if you?ll be so kind, I?d be much obliged if you?d drop me off my ship.\",pirates
337,Jack,They done what?s right by them. Can?t expect more than that.\,pirates
338,Jack,"Captain, Captain Jack Sparrow .\",pirates
340,Jack,\,pirates
348,Jack,\,pirates
352,Jack,I thought you were supposed to keep to the Code.\,pirates
353,Jack,Thank you.\,pirates
354,Jack,"And really bad eggs?drink up, me 'earties, yo ho.\",pirates
364,Jack,Do you mind if we make a little side trip? I didn’t think so.,pirates
365,Jack,"Complications arose, ensued, were overcome.",pirates
366,Jack,Muhuh.,pirates
367,Jack,Shiny?,pirates
368,Jack,"Is that how you’re all feeling, then? Perhaps dear ol’ Jack is not serving your best interests as Captain?",pirates
369,Jack,What did the bird say?!,pirates
370,Jack,It does me.,pirates
371,Jack,"Gentlemen, what do keys do?",pirates
372,Jack,"No.  We don’t have the key, we can’t open whatever it is we don’t have that it unlocks. So, what purpose would be served in finding whatever need be unlocked, which we don’t have, without first having found the key what unlocks it.",pirates
373,Jack,You’re not making any sense at all.  Any more questions?,pirates
374,Jack,Ah!  that way direction!,pirates
375,Jack,"Come on. Snap to and make sail, you know how this works. Oi, oi!",pirates
382,Jack,,pirates
383,Jack,Bootstrap. Bill Turner?,pirates
384,Jack,Is this a dream?,pirates
385,Jack,"I thought not, if it were, there’d be rum.",pirates
386,Jack,"I had some help retrieving the Pearl, by the way. Your son.",pirates
387,Jack,And to what do I owe the pleasure of your carbuncle?,pirates
388,Jack,"Ah. So it’s you, then. He shanghaied you into service, eh?",pirates
389,Jack,It’s funny what a man Will do to forestall his final judgment.,pirates
390,Jack,"Technically, I –",pirates
391,Jack,"Yes, but The Flying Dutchman already has a Captain, so there’s really –",pirates
392,Jack,Any idea when Jones might release said terrible beastie?,pirates
393,Jack,,pirates
394,Jack,"I want a—- , plenty running. Run as if the devil himself and itself was upon us!",pirates
395,Jack,Ah!,pirates

419,Jack,,pirates
420,Jack,Save me.,pirates
433,Jack,,pirates
438,Jack,Well done.,pirates
444,Jack,"Well, go on, go get them! Helalla!",pirates
447,Jack,Stop it!,pirates
448,Jack,,pirates
450,Jack,Oi!,pirates
452,Jack,Oi!  – Captain Jack Sparrow.,pirates
453,Jack,"Yes to the first, yes to the second, but only as so far as we keep to the shallows as much as possible.",pirates
454,Jack,"I have every faith in your reconciliatory navigational skills, Master Gibbs. Now, where is that monkey? I want to shoot something.",pirates
456,Jack,Ah.,pirates
458,Jack,Have you considered keeping a more watchful eye on her. Maybe just lock her up somewhere?,pirates
460,Jack,There comes a time when one must take responsibility for one’s mistakes.,pirates
462,Jack,Mr. Gibbs?,pirates
463,Jack,We have a need to travel upriver.,pirates
464,Jack,"No, a resolute and unyielding need.",pirates
466,Jack,"William… I shall trade you the compass, if you Will help me…  to find this.",pirates
468,Jack,"No. You want you to find this. Because the finding of this, finds you incapacitorially finding and/or locating in your discovering the detecting of a way to save your dolly belle ol’ what’s her face. Savvy?",pirates
470,Jack,How much do you know about Davy Jones?,pirates
472,Jack,"Yeah, it’s going to save Elizabeth.",pirates
476,Jack,"No worries, mates. Tia Dalma and I go way back. Thick as thieves. Nigh inseparable we are. Were. Have been. Before.",pirates
477,Jack,It’s me front I’m worried about.,pirates
479,Jack,Tia Dalma.,pirates
481,Jack,There’ll be no knowing here.  I thought I knew you.,pirates
482,Jack,Come.,pirates
483,Jack,I brought payment.  an undead monkey. Top that!,pirates
485,Jack,Maybe. Why?,pirates
487,Jack,A woman!,pirates
490,Jack,"I did not. I didn’t know where the key was. But now we do. So, all that’s left is to climb aboard the Flying Dutchman, grab the key, you go back to Port Royal and save your bonnie lass, aye?",pirates
491,Jack,"My eyesight’s as good as ever, just so you know.",pirates
492,Jack,Dirt. This is a jar of dirt.,pirates
493,Jack,Is the… jar of dirt going to help?,pirates
494,Jack,No.,pirates
497,Jack,Neither do you… do not underestimate it.,pirates
498,Jack,What’s your plan?,pirates
500,Jack,And if there are Crewmen?,pirates
502,Jack,"I like it. Simple, easy to remember.",pirates
503,Jack,"Oi! If you do have to get captured, just say Jack Sparrow sent you to settle his debt. Might save your life.",pirates
504,Jack,Douse the lamps.,pirates
510,Jack,Oh.,pirates
511,Jack,"Technically, I was only Captain for two years, then I was viciously mutinied upon.",pirates
512,Jack,"Yeah, I gave you payment. One soul to serve on your ship is already over there.",pirates
513,Jack,"Aha! So we’ve establish my proposal is sound in principle, now we’re just haggling over price.",pirates
514,Jack,"Just how many souls, do you think, my soul is worth?",pirates
515,Jack,"You’re a darling, mate. Send me back the boy, I’ll get started right off.",pirates
516,Jack,"Have you not met Will Turner? He’s noble, heroic, a terrific soprano. Worth at least four, maybe three and a half. And did I happen to mention… he’s in love. With a girl. Due to be married. Betrothed. Dividing him from her and her from him would only be half as cruel as actually allowing them to be joined in holy matrimony. Aye?",pirates
517,Jack,Ah.,pirates
518,Jack,"Uh, Mr. Gibbs?",pirates
519,Jack,I feel sullied and unusual.,pirates
520,Jack,"Fortunately, he was mum as the condition in which these souls need be.",pirates
521,Jack,Tortuga.,pirates
524,Jack,,pirates
525,Jack,I know what I want.,pirates
526,Jack,How are we going?,pirates
527,Jack,You’re hired.,pirates
528,Jack,Time to go.,pirates
529,Jack,,pirates
540,Jack,"Come to join me Crew, lad? Welcome aboard.",pirates
542,Jack,"I’m deeply flattered, son, but my first and only love is the sea.",pirates
544,Jack,You know these clothes do not flatter you at all. It should be a dress or nothing. I happen to have no dress in my cabin.,pirates
546,Jack,"Darling, I am truly unhappy to have to tell you this, but through an unfortunate and entirely unforeseeable series of circumstances that had nothing whatsoever to do with me, poor Will has been press-ganged into Davy Jones’s Crew.",pirates
548,Jack,"You look bloody awful, what are you doing here?",pirates
549,Jack,You smell funny.,pirates
551,Jack,Hmm.,pirates
553,Jack,Are you certain? Is that what you really want most?,pirates
555,Jack,"Because I would think, you’d want to find a way to save Will most.",pirates
557,Jack,"Well, there is a chest.",pirates
558,Jack,A chest of unknown size and origin.,pirates
559,Jack,"And whoever possesses that chest, possesses the leverage to command Jones to do whatever it is he or she wants. Including saving brave William from his grim fate.",pirates
561,Jack,With this.  My compass… is unique.,pirates
562,Jack,True enough.  This compass does not point north.,pirates
564,Jack,It points to the thing you want most in this world.,pirates
566,Jack,"Every word, love. And what you want most in this world…  is to find the chest of Davy Jones, is it not?",pirates
568,Jack,By finding the chest of Davy Jones.  Mr. Gibbs!,pirates
569,Jack,We have our heading.,pirates
570,Jack,,pirates
585,Jack,Beckett.,pirates
587,Jack,,pirates
588,Jack,Ah.,pirates
589,Jack,Of course. He wants the chest.,pirates
591,Jack,"A truly discomforting notion, love.",pirates
592,Jack,Might I enquire as to how you came by these.,pirates
594,Jack,Friendly?,pirates
596,Jack,"Will strikes a deal for these and upholds it with honor, yet you are the one standing here with the prize.  As if I could be bought for such a low price.",pirates
598,Jack,No. Persuade me.,pirates
600,Jack,,pirates
609,Jack,My tremendous intuitive sense of the female creature informs me that you are… troubled.,pirates
611,Jack,"Lizzie, I am Captain of a ship and being Captain of a ship I could, in fact, perform a marriage right here. Right on this deck. Rightâ€¦ now.",pirates
613,Jack,Why not? We are very much alike you and I. I and you… us.,pirates
615,Jack,"Trifles. You Will come over to my side, I know it.",pirates
617,Jack,"One word, love",pirates
619,Jack,My compass works fine.,pirates
621,Jack,I love those moments. I like to wave at them as they pass by.,pirates
623,Jack,All evidence to the contrary.,pirates
625,Jack,"Do tell, dearie.",pirates
627,Jack,I do want to know what it tastes like.,pirates
629,Jack,I need my jar of dirt.,pirates
630,Jack,Guard the boat; mind the tides… don’t touch my dirt.,pirates
632,Jack,"Yes, it does, you’re sitting on it.",pirates
634,Jack,,pirates
636,Jack,"I do that quite a lot, yet people are still surprised.",pirates
639,Jack,How did you get here?,pirates
641,Jack,Not so easy is it?,pirates
643,Jack,You do?,pirates
646,Jack,What?,pirates
648,Jack,"Oh, well, you’re welcome, then.",pirates
650,Jack,"Pretty much. Time and tide, love.  Oi, what are you doing?",pirates
652,Jack,"Can’t let you do that, William. ‘Cause if Jones is dead, who’s to call his terrible beastie off the hunt, eh?  The key.",pirates
654,Jack,I knew you’d warm up to me eventually.,pirates
655,Jack,Ah. The dark side of ambition.,pirates
661,Jack,,pirates
664,Jack,"Let us examine that claim for a moment, former Commodore, shall we? Who was it that at the very moment you had a notorious pirate safely behind bars saw fit to free said pirate and take your dearly beloved all to hisself… aye? So whose fault is it really that you’ve ended up a rum-pot deckhand what takes orders from pirates?",pirates
665,Jack,Oh.,pirates
667,Jack,Hmm.,pirates
668,Jack,"Oh, shut it.",pirates
669,Jack,,pirates
672,Jack,Leave him lie! Unless you plan on using him to hit something with.,pirates
675,Jack,I-I say we respect his final wish.,pirates
678,Jack,Fell behind.,pirates
680,Jack,"I’ve got a jar of di-irt, I’ve got a jar of di-irt, and guess what’s inside it?",pirates
681,Jack,Hard to starboard.,pirates
689,Jack,Why fight when you can negotiate? All one needs is the proper leverage.  Where is it? Where is the thump thump?,pirates
709,Jack,Abandon ship. Into the long boat.,pirates
710,Jack,"She’s only a ship, mate.",pirates
714,Jack,"We’re not free yet, though.",pirates
717,Jack,Pirate.,pirates
720,Jack,,pirates
754,Jack,My peanut. All hands slackened braces!,pirates
755,Jack,Mr. Sparrow.,pirates
756,Jack,What say you about the condition of this tack line?,pirates
757,Jack,"Proper? It is neither proper nor suitable, sir, it is neither acceptable nor adequate. It is in obvious fact an abomination.",pirates
758,Jack,"Shall I?  That sort of thinking got us into this mess. Gentlemen, we have lost speed and therefore time, precious time, which cannot be regained once lost. Do you understand?",pirates
759,Jack,"It will all have to be redone, all of it! And let that serve as a lesson to the lot of you!",pirates
762,Jack,Mr Gibbs!,pirates
763,Jack,"I thought so. I expect you can account for your actions, then?",pirates
764,Jack,"There has been a perpetual and virulent lack of discipline aboard my vessel! Why is that, sir?",pirates
765,Jack,"I know that. I know where I am, and don’t think I don’t.",pirates
766,Jack,"Ah, Hector. It’s been too long, hasn’t it?",pirates
767,Jack,"No I didn’t. Ah, Tia Dalma, out and about, eh? You lend an agreeable sense of the macabre to any delirium.",pirates
769,Jack,"William, tell me something. Have you come because you need my help to rescue a certain distressing damsel? Or rather a damsel in distress? Either one.",pirates
770,Jack,Then you wouldn’t be here. So you can’t be here. Q.E.D. you’re not really here.,pirates
772,Jack,"The locker, you say?",pirates
774,Jack,"Have you, now? That’s very kind of you. But seeing as I possess a ship and you don’t, it seems as though you’re the ones in need of rescuing and I’m not sure as I’m in the mood.",pirates
775,Jack,"Can’t spot it, must be a tiny little thing hiding somewhere behind the Pearl.",pirates
778,Jack,"Leave you people alone for a minute and look what’s happened, everything’s gone to pot.",pirates
780,Jack,"Why should I sail with any of you? Four of you have tried to kill me in the past, one of you succeeded.",pirates
781,Jack,"Oh, she’s not told you? You’ll have loads to talk about while you’re here.  As for you...",pirates
782,Jack,"All right, fair enough, you’re in.  Who are you?",pirates
783,Jack,Where do your allegiances lie?,pirates
784,Jack,I have a ship.,pirates
785,Jack,"Good man. Weigh anchor, all hands, prepare to make sail.",pirates
786,Jack,Trim that sail!,pirates
787,Jack,Slack windward brace and sheets!,pirates
788,Jack,Haul that pallet line!,pirates
789,Jack,What are YOU doing?,pirates
790,Jack,What are YOU doing?,pirates
791,Jack,What are YOU doing? Captain gives orders on the ship!,pirates
792,Jack,"My ship, makes me captain.",pirates
793,Jack,That makes you...chart man!,pirates
804,Jack,"Elizabeth, we’re not back.",pirates
817,Jack,UP IS DOWN. Well that’s just maddeningly unhelpful. Why are these things never clear?,pirates
818,Jack,Come again?,pirates
819,Jack,Well that’s more than less than unhelpful.,pirates
820,Jack,I love the sea.,pirates
821,Jack,I prefer rum. Rum’s good.,pirates
822,Jack,Once every ten years.,pirates
823,Jack,Even longer given the deficit of rum.,pirates
824,Jack,"Oh, I like that.",pirates
825,Jack,"Not sunset, sundown... and rise.  What’s that? I don’t know, what IS that? What do you think?",pirates
827,Jack,There!,pirates
829,Jack,Now up is down.,pirates
831,Jack,"I is arguin’ the point. If there’s pirates a-gatherin’, I’m pointing my ship the other way.",pirates
834,Jack,"I quite like the sound of that. Captain Jack Sparrow, the last pirate.",pirates
835,Jack,"I’m still working on that. But I’ll not be going back to the locker, mate, count on that.",pirates
837,Jack,"You can lead the shore party, and I’ll stay with my ship.",pirates
839,Jack,"Sometimes, things come back, mate. We’re living proof, you and me.",pirates
840,Jack,"Summoning the Brethren Court, then, is it?",pirates
841,Jack,That’s a sad commentary in and of itself.,pirates
842,Jack,The world’s still the same. There’s just less in it.,pirates
843,Jack,He’s the captain.,pirates
844,Jack,"That doesn’t sound like me.  Shall we just call it square, then?",pirates
846,Jack,Captain Turner?,pirates
850,Jack,He needs the Pearl! Captain Turner needs the Pearl! And you felt guilty. And you and your Brethren Court! Did no one come to save me just because they missed me?  I’m standing over there with them.,pirates
851,Jack,I’m not certain I can survive any more visits from old friends.,pirates
852,Jack,What? What isn’t?,pirates
853,Jack,"By my reckoning, that account has been settled.",pirates
854,Jack,Close your eyes and pretend it’s all a bad dream. That’s how I get by.,pirates
856,Jack,"Regarding the Brethren Court, no doubt? In exchange for fair compensation, square my debt with Jones, guarantee my freedom?",pirates
857,Jack,"Were I in a divulgatory mood, what then might I divulge?",pirates
858,Jack,"You can keep Barbossa, the belligerent homunculus and his friend with the wooden eye both, and Turner... especially Turner. The rest go with me aboard the Pearl, and I will lead you to Shipwreck Cove, where I will hand you the pirates and you will NOT hand me to Jones. Bloody fair deal, don’t you think?",pirates
859,Jack,What interest is she to you?,pirates
862,Jack,"It points to what you want most, and that’s not the Brethren Court, is it?",pirates
863,Jack,Me. Dead.,pirates
869,Jack,"With me killed, you’d arrive at Shipwreck Cove, find its stronghold nigh impregnable, able to withstand blockade for years, and then you’d wish, “Oh, if only there were someone I had not killed inside to assure that the pirates then come outside...”",pirates
870,Jack,"You may kill me, but you may never insult me. Who am I?  Done!",pirates
871,Jack,"Thank goodness for that, because if I wasn’t, this would probably never work.",pirates
872,Jack,And that was without a single drop of rum.  Send this pestilent traitorous cowhearted yeasty codpiece to the brig.,pirates
899,Jack,"Bravo, you escaped the brig even quicker than I expected. William, do you notice something? Or rather do you notice something that is not there to be noted?",pirates
901,Jack,"Odd, isn’t it? But not as odd as this. Come up with this all by your lonesome, did you?",pirates
903,Jack,"And this is what you’ve arrived at? Lead Beckett to Shipwreck Cove so as to gain his trust, accomplish your own ends? It’s like you don’t know me at all, mate. And how does your dearly beloved feel about this?  Ah, you’ve not seen fit to trust her with it.",pirates
905,Jack,"Mate, if you choose to lock your heart away, you’ll lose it for certain. If I may lend a machete to your intellectual thicket—avoid the choice altogether. Change the facts. Let someone else dispatch Jones.",pirates
907,Jack,"Death has a curious way or reshuffling one’s priorities. I’ll slip aboard the Dutchman, find the heart, stab the beating thing. Your father goes free, and you’re free to be with your charming murderess.",pirates
909,Jack,"No mate, I’m free forever. Free to sail the seas beyond the edges of the map, free from death itself.",pirates
911,Jack,"I don’t have the face for tentacles. But immortal has to count for something, eh? Oh!",pirates
913,Jack,"Think like me, it’ll come to you.  My regards to Davy Jones!",pirates
920,Jack,"For all that pirates are clever cobs, we are an unimaginative lot when it comes to naming things.",pirates
921,Jack,I once sailed with a geezer lost both of his arms and part of his eye.,pirates

931,Jack,And I owe them all money.,pirates
932,Jack,"Might I point out that we are still short one pirate lord, and I’m content as a cucumber to wait until Sao Feng joins us.",pirates
934,Jack,And made you captain? They’re just giving the bloody title away now.,pirates
937,Jack,Not among us.,pirates

943,Jack,"Whose boons? Your boons? Utterly deceptive twaddlespeak, says I.",pirates
944,Jack,"Cuttlefish. Let us not, dear friends, forget our dear friends the cuttlefish. Flippant glorious little sausages. Pen ‘em up together and they’ll devour each other without a second thought. Human nature, isn’t it?...or....or fish nature.  So yes, we could hole up here well provisioned and well armed and half of us would be dead within the month, which seems grim to me any way you slice it. Or, as my learned colleague so naively suggests, we could release Calypso, and we can pray that she will be merciful. I rather doubt it. Can we in fact pretend that she is anything other than a woman scorned, like which fury hell hath no? We cannot. Res ipso loquitur tabula in naufragio , we are left with but one option. I agree with, and I cannot believe the words are comin’ out of me mouth, Captain Swann. We must fight.",pirates

949,Jack,You made that up.,pirates

957,Jack,"Am I to understand that you lot will not be keeping to the code, then?",pirates
959,Jack,"What? You’ve seen it all, done it all, you survived. That’s the trick, isn’t it? To survive.",pirates
960,Jack,How’s mum?,pirates
961,Jack,She looks great.,pirates

1037,Jack,Now go and get it.,pirates
1042,Jack,"Keep telling yourself that, darlin’.  Once was quite enough.",pirates
1047,Jack,"Granted, it tends to list to port and has on occasion been known to frighten young women, but I guarantee you will not be disappointed.",pirates
1048,Jack,"That, love, is a dinghy. My vessel is magnificent, and fierce, and huge-ish, and... gone. Why is it gone?",pirates
1049,Jack,"Yes, there it is. Why is it there? It’s much larger up close.",pirates
1050,Jack,"Mr. Gibbs, any particular reason why my ship is gone?",pirates
1051,Jack,"Really?  And by the way, no, I’ve never actually met Pisaro, but I love his pies. And all of this pales into utter insignificance in light of the fact that my ship is once again, gone, savvy?",pirates
1052,Jack,Give nothing back.,pirates
