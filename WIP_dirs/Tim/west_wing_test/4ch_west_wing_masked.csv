22,toby,We’re flying in a Lockheed eagle series L-1011. It came off the line 20 months ago  and carries a Sim-5 Transponder tracking system. Are you telling me I can still  flummox this thing with something I bought at Radio Shack?
23,toby," Also, I never got my peanuts."
59,josh,"It’s important to understand, Leo, that by and large, these aren’t fishing boats.  You hear fishing boats, you conjure an image of -- well, of a boat, first of all.  What the Cubans are on would charitably be described as rafts. Okay? They’re making  the hop from Havana to Miami in fruit baskets, basically. Let’s just be clear on that."
61,josh,"Donna’s desk, if it could float, would look good to them right now."
71,josh,"Tell them to send the Coast Guard, Leo."

148,toby,They’re running for their lives. You don’t have to start a game of Red Rover with  Castro. But you don’t send in the National Guard. You send food and you send doctors.

200,josh,What they want to hear.
202,josh,"If you listen carefully, you can hear two centuries of Presidents rolling over in  their graves."

207,toby,So C.J. can put it in the papers...
208,josh, Al Caldwell is friends with bad people! I think he should say  so for the common good. Screw politics! How about that?

217,josh, That’s a good picture of her.
225,josh,"Yeah, ‘cause they’re probably all tuned to the National Weather Service, but that’s  not what I’m here for."
227,josh,"We’ve gotta look at the whole field for a minute, ‘cause I think we’re about to  get tagged."
231,josh,Don’t let Lloyd Russell push us around on Medicare or medium range missiles.
234,josh,Hollywood likes him. He can raise money.
236,josh,"30 second hypothetical: You’re Lloyd Russell, newly crowned prince of the White  suburban woman, the upper middle class Black man and teacher’s union. You’re no  friend to the sitting President. What do you do?"
238,josh,And who do you get to run it?
250,josh,Working for Lloyd Russell.
255,josh,"Sure.  This is Mandy Hampton. She’s  excellent, too."
256,josh,She used to steal money from me.
257,josh,Yeah. Thanks a lot for stopping by.
260,josh,I really don’t care one way or the other. He’s a lightweight. I just...
261,josh,Not when I can’t use him. No. I just wanna know how much trouble he’s gonna be on  the budget surplus.
263,josh,"Please, Mandy. It’s not like these people were in our camp to begin with."
264,josh,Did you just call him Lloyd?
266,josh,"A minute ago. You said ""What do you wanna know? Is-is Lloyd gonna run""?"

268,josh,You know what I’m saying.

274,josh,He always seemed effeminate to me.
277,josh,This is the first I’m hearing of it.
279,josh,"Wait a minute. One minute you’re giving me career advice, the next minute you’re  telling me we don’t play for..."

401,josh,"Lloyd Russell. Yeah, that’ll last."
402,c.j.,Are you listening to me?
403,josh, They’re gonna try and bait me.
404,c.j.,They want you to say something arrogant.

407,c.j.,"It’s a mild sprain, he’ll be fine."
409,toby,"Everybody, sit, sit, sit. We’re happy you all could come talk with us today. As  you know, the President makes a usual Sunday morning radio address, and in a few  weeks we’ve scheduled--"
410,josh,"Yes, I know, and I’m glad you brought that up..."
411,josh,"And I’m honored by that, Reverend. First, let me say that when I spoke on the  program yesterday, I was not speaking for the President or this administration.  That’s important to know. Second, please allow me to apologize. My remarks were glib  and insulting. I was going for the cheap laugh, and anybody willing to step up and  debate ideas deserves better than a political punch line. Mary, I apologize."
414,toby,"Well, like Josh said..."
416,toby,School prayer or pornography?

426,josh,"I’m actually from Connecticut, but that’s neither here nor there. The point is, Mary..."

428,josh,"You know what, Toby, let’s just not even go there."
429,toby," I’m afraid that’s just tough, Mrs. Marsh."
434,toby,"No, if I’m gonna make you sit through this preposterous exercise, we’re gonna get  the names of the damn commandments right."

437,c.j.,"Well, we’ve got some hot tempers, Mr. President."
442,bartlet,"On the other hand, I do think that five dollars is too high a price to pay for  pornography."
443,c.j.,Why don’t we all sit down?
444,bartlet,"No. Let’s not, C.J. These people won’t be staying that long. May I have some coffee,  Mr. Lewis? Al, how many times have I asked you to denounce the practices of a fringe  group that calls itself The Lambs of God?"
445,bartlet,"Crap. It is up to you, Al. You, know, my wife, Abbey, she never wants me to do  anything while I’m upset.  Except I forgot to open the garage door."
448,josh,"Okay, can I just say that, as it turned out, I was the calmest person in the room?"
451,toby,I am not empowered to auction off the Bill of Rights.
452,josh,I thought you were going to take a swing at her there.
453,toby,"She was calling us New York Jews, Josh."
454,josh,"Yeah, but being from Connecticut, I didn’t mind so much.  You, C.J., on the other hand, were brilliant. I particularly liked the part where  you said nothing at all."
455,c.j.,"I’m sorry, Josh, I was distracted. All I could really think about was Lloyd Russell  and your girlfriend."
457,josh,I’ll be puttin’ an end to that.
458,bartlet,"""Hello, Mr. President. Did you have a nice trip, sir? How’s the ankle, sir?""  Seems to me we’ve all been taking a little break. Thinking about our personal lives  or thinking about keeping our jobs. Breaks are good. It’s not a bad idea taking a  break every now and then. I know how hard you all work."
459,bartlet," With the clothes on their  backs, they came through a storm. And the ones that didn’t die want a better life.  And they want it here. Talk about impressive. My point is this: Break’s over."
461,bartlet,"Josh. ""Too busy being indicted for tax fraud""?  Don’t ever do it again."
462,bartlet, Mrs. Landingham. What’s next?
463,josh, Victory is mine! Victory is mine! Great day in the  morning people. Victory is mine!
465,josh,"I drink from the keg of glory, Donna. Bring me the finest muffins and bagels in  all the land."

471,toby,How does someone decline an invitation for a photo-op with the President?
472,c.j.,I’m saying this is the kind of luck we’re having.
477,toby,Who cares? We need somebody.
478,c.j.,You try getting his attention on this.
479,toby,"Mrs. Landingham, does the President have free time this morning?"
480,toby,"Sarcasm’s a disturbing thing coming from a woman of your age, Mrs. Landingham."
487,c.j.,They’re issuing a press release. We’re gonna be playing defense all day.
489,c.j.,It’s because of the joke.
490,josh,"Someone give me a river to forge, a serpent to slay."
495,josh,"Thank you very much. C.J., they turned down the invitation?"
498,c.j.,It means they turned down the invitation.
500,c.j.,"Of course, because of the joke. Why does everyone keep asking? As if it could  be something..."
502,bartlet,That’s no good. Jaworski knows that’s no good.
504,bartlet,Americans need to buy more American cars.
508,josh,443’s gonna stay in committee.
511,c.j.,The Ryder Cup team is declining our invitation to come to the White House.
517,c.j.,It’s a group of the best golfers in the country...
518,bartlet,I know what the Ryder Cup team is. Thanks Mrs. Landingham.
519,c.j.,"Sir, this may be a good time to talk about your sense of humor."
520,bartlet," I’ve got an intelligence briefing, a security briefing,  and a 90-minute budget meeting all scheduled for the same 45 minutes. You sure  this is a good time to talk about my sense of humor?"
524,c.j.,It’s just that it’s not the first time it’s happened.
526,toby,"She’s talking about Texas, sir."
528,c.j.,U.S.A. Today asks you why you don’t spend more time campaigning in Texas and  you say it’s ‘cause you don’t look good in funny hats.
530,c.j.,What difference does it make?
532,c.j.,The point is we got whomped in Texas.
533,josh,We got whomped in Texas twice.
534,c.j.,"We got whomped in the primary, and we got whomped in November."
536,c.j.,"And it was avoidable, sir."
537,bartlet,"C.J., on your tombstone, it’s gonna read, “Post hoc, ergo propter hoc.”"
538,c.j.,"Okay, but none of my visitors are going to be able to understand my tombstone."
539,bartlet,"Twenty-seven lawyers in the room, anybody know “post hoc, ergo propter hoc?”  Josh?"
540,josh,"Uh, uh, post, after, after hoc, ergo, therefore, after hoc, therefore,  something else hoc."
542,josh,"Uh, if I’d gotten more credit on the 443..."
545,bartlet,"After it, therefore because of it. It means one thing follows the other,  therefore it was caused by the other, but it’s not always true. In fact, it’s  hardly ever true. We did not lose Texas because of the hat joke. Do you know  when we lost Texas?"
546,c.j.,When you learned to speak Latin?
551,josh,Let me see it at three.
584,josh,What kind of a pool was it?
586,josh,You picked Central Indiana State?

596,josh,The Ryder Cup is just the latest in a string.
598,josh,The banking committee...
600,josh,Bicycle under the tree?
601,toby,"Yes, though I’m not sure what our new media director would have done about that."
602,josh,"Me neither, but we need a new media director. I’d been on talent shows with  more polish than some of the events around here."
606,josh,We need to double-team him.
607,toby,If we bring Sam and C.J. too.
612,josh,"Listen, it’s not gonna be Mandy, right?"
615,c.j.,“Post hoc ergo propter hoc”? I’ll bet that used to have them rolling in the  aisles at the Whiffinpoof Dinners.
616,toby,Fly in the teeth with it.
618,toby,Be funny. You’re at your best with a pie in the face.
620,toby,"In fact, I’d hold back. Keep it in your back pocket."
622,toby,"If you don’t like the rhythm of the “Q” and “A,” use the Ryder Cup. Just fly in  the teeth with it."
624,c.j.,"Good morning. We got a birthday today, right? Suzanne?"
626,c.j.,"No. I can’t, Mike. I haven’t spoken with the Vice President today."
628,c.j.,"It sounds pretty straightforward. I’ll tell you what though, if you consult the  morning releases, you’ll see that in the world of sports, the White House just  got dissed by 12 guys named Flippy."
630,c.j.," I have to say that it came as a bit of a surprise to discover that  professional golfers don’t have a sense of humor, especially after seeing them  in some of the outfits."
635,josh," C.J. just discovered that Hoynes, when responding to  a question on A3, said “this is the time when the President needs our support.”  Third one in five weeks."
639,josh,I think it goes right on Leo’s desk.
646,josh,Didn’t you come to see me?
654,josh,Do you want to maybe close the door?
656,josh,You slept with a call girl?
658,josh,Did she know who you are?
660,josh,I’m asking some questions here.
662,josh,You don’t think that she...
670,josh,"You want to call her again, don’t you?"
672,josh,The only thing I know about her is she’s a call girl. Is she a call girl?
674,josh,Then so far she’s exactly what I think.
676,josh,"Oh, you’re gonna try and reform her, aren’t you?"
682,josh,"You got to promise me this is never gonna happen, Sam."
693,josh,"Yes.  Look, whatever quest..."
695,josh,Whatever. You’re playing with fire here. Just talk to Toby before you do  anything.
699,josh,No.  Just talk to Toby. Just Toby.
703,c.j.,"I’m gonna kill him, Josh."
704,josh,I would definitely talk to him.
705,c.j.,"Oh, I’m gonna talk to him, all right."
706,josh,I want you to stay on the perimeter.
707,c.j.,I’ve been staying on the perimeter.
708,josh,I don’t want it on Leo’s desk. Thank you
711,c.j.,It’ll just be a minute.
712,c.j.,"Excuse me, Mr. Vice President?"
713,c.j.,"Sir, I-I wanted to talk to you for a moment about A3-C3."
714,c.j.,"I wanted to apologize since I’ve been quickly here and in getting everyone on  the same page, sometimes people get left behind for a day or two..."
715,c.j.,I was saying that had we properly briefed your office...
717,c.j.,"The quote the room is running with is, “This is the time when the President  needs our support.”"
718,c.j.,"Well, you can see how that might be interpreted...?"
723,bartlet,"You should stay here. We got Amman, a woman, little kids, the works."
725,bartlet,Everybody’s a critic today.
727,bartlet,Good for you. How long are you gonna stay?
732,bartlet,Can she spell anything yet?
735,bartlet,"Oh, she’s beautiful. What’s her name?"
736,bartlet,That name’s got a hell of a past.
737,bartlet,Your wife’s beautiful too. How’d you get her to marry you? Did you trick her  or something?
738,bartlet,"Yeah, I figured.  Morris, I made a joke about golfers yesterday, and now  it consumes the whole damn building."
739,bartlet,"Jokes like that are part of my folksy charm, Morris. It’s the very heart of my  popularity."
740,bartlet,"Oh, we’re having some difficulty getting the word out."
741,bartlet,"Oh, thank you. Is this from this morning, Carol?"
746,bartlet," Yeah, why not? Two Dewars on the rocks, Mrs. Landingham."
747,bartlet,"I had a meeting this morning with the Joint Chiefs.  I’m an accomplished  man, Morris. I can sit comfortably with prime ministers and Presidents, even  the pope. Why is it every time I sit with the Joint Chiefs, I feel like I’m  back at my father’s dinner table."
748,bartlet,"You’re a naval officer. You’re a doctor in a uniform.  It’s not like I’m  totally without experience, you know. "
749,bartlet,You’re talking to a former governor. I was commander-in-chief of the New  Hampshire National Guard.
750,bartlet,"Didn’t have to. We’d just stand on the border and stare you down. Then we’d all  go for pancakes. Like you had a lot of closed infantry combat training in  premed, huh?"
752,bartlet,I don’t need a flu shot.
753,bartlet,How do I know this isn’t the start of a military coup?
754,bartlet,I want the Secret Service in here right away.
755,bartlet,Now that’s a thought that’s gonna fester.
756,bartlet,"Thank you. I’m not comfortable with violence.  I know this country has  enemies, but I don’t feel violent toward any of them. I don’t know whether  that’s a weakness or not, but I think I know how the Joint Chiefs would answer  that question."
758,bartlet,Don’t forget your picture. Corey’s a beautiful child.
759,bartlet,"You didn’t do nothing, mister. You were a passenger on this one. Your job is to  pay the bills, and do what these ladies tell you to do."
760,bartlet,"Also, you got to teach her how to whistle. Her mother won’t do that."
761,bartlet,"I’ll see you next week, Morris."
763,bartlet,Look at that picture again. See? The past isn’t the only thing your family can  be proud of.
766,bartlet,"I do, indeed. Mr. White, good to see you. Mr. Finley..."
774,josh,"Tell you what, can you give me Yeshiva University over the Dallas Cowboys?"
776,c.j., Excuse me. Leo will be ready for us in about a half hour.
779,josh,Did you talk to Hoynes?
787,c.j.,Leo will call when he’s ready.
795,toby,Wait and hope that the statement comes out of the U.N. by the end of the week.
796,toby,"No, actually the U.N. is already doing the least they can do."
802,toby,You’re talking about the Hilton head draft?
814,toby,You accidentally slept with a prostitute?
818,toby,I don’t understand. Did you trip over something?
820,toby,There wasn’t a red flag when she charged you money in exchange for sex?
822,toby,Where did you meet her?
832,toby,...of The Wall Street Journal!
834,toby,Before you picked up a hooker.
836,toby,"Well, that’s a distinction that’s gonna be very important to the Grand Jury."
838,toby,Who else knows about this?
842,toby,"So it’s just me, you, the hooker, the President’s deputy chief of staff, and  The Wall Street Journal!"
846,toby," No, no, Sam, no. You’re going to try and reform her?"
853,toby,  Did you know about this?
857,toby,And you’re not concerned?
858,josh,"Who among us hasn’t known forbidden love, Toby? Why spring break alone..."
860,toby,"This administration doesn’t even need an opposition party, do you know that, we  do fine by ourselves."
861,josh,"Sam, just don’t do anything stupid okay?"
863,josh,Nice job on the Hilton head draft.
865,toby,A full time consultant.
867,josh,"Yes, but that’s not the meeting we’re having right now."
869,josh,The Ryder Cup shouldn’t have even ended up on our radar screen.
871,josh,So you’ll let us hire a media consultant? You’ll let the D.N.C. spend some  money?
878,c.j.,"Who is recently unemployed, and by the way, I don’t think Josh has gotten  enough credit for that. "
882,josh,Wait a second. This is an ambush.
884,josh,I’m getting mugged and you’re the gang leader.
888,josh, She used to be my girlfriend!
893,josh,"Wait, I-I have certain objections."
895,josh,"For one thing, the President would never go for this."
898,josh,All right... listen... fine... I’m a team player. I think my record is pretty  clear on that.
900,josh,As long as she understands that she answers to me and she answers to Toby. I  don’t want to have to go 15 rounds with her in the Oval Office.
904,josh,"I’m going to draw a chart for her with lines and arrows, clearly indicating  that she answers to me and she answers to Toby."
907,c.j.,"Yeah, I talked to him for a minute this morning."
913,c.j.,"Miscommunication, he’s on board."
917,c.j.,"His statement got truncated, I’d leave it alone."
922,josh,She answers to me and she answers to Toby. 
925,bartlet,All righty. Thank you. What’s in the bag?
928,bartlet,"I think they left me something else, Mrs. Landingham."
929,bartlet,"I think they left me 12 center-cut prime fillet Omaha Steaks, Mrs. Landingham."
930,bartlet,I was going to have Mario fix me one of those steaks tonight. 
932,bartlet,"You are a cattle rustler, Mrs. Landingham."
933,bartlet,"Between you and Dr. Tolliver, who needs a wife or a mother?"
936,josh,"Jed Bartlet, Nobel Laureate in Economics, three-term congressman, two-term  Governor, You guys look like you could use a client. What do you say? You want  to work for the leader of the free world?"
939,josh,"Okay, we have some rules."
940,josh,"Number one, she can’t punch me. Number two, I prefer it if the two of you  didn’t get drunk in the middle of the day."
941,josh,"Yes, I really am quite something."
942,josh,The look on Mandy’s face is thanks enough. Get your coats. You hungry?
943,josh,"Lets go. Rule number 3, and I really can’t emphasize this enough, you answer to  me and you answer to Toby. My office is drawing up some instructional charts  that pretty much outline the chain of command. For instance, you answer to me  and you answer to Toby."
1019,josh,So they’ll be in position in two hours?
1027,bartlet,Where is the Syrian ambassador?
1031,bartlet,"Alright, uh...  I’m gonna call Morris’ wife now. I’ll meet you in the  Situation Room."
1034,bartlet,I am not frightened. I’m gonna blow them off the face of the earth with the  fury of God’s own thunder.  Get the commanders.
1040,josh,"""Good morning, Josh"" is a pretty good way to start the day. "
1044,josh,Tell her I’m in the office. 
1048,josh,‘Cause you know everything. 
1052,josh,You make plenty of substantive contributions. 
1054,josh,This! This could be a substantive contribution. 
1058,josh,Do-- but I’m not the one who pays you. 
1060,josh,"Donna, she’s looking for me. Do you really think this is the best time to talk  about a raise? "
1062,josh,"Donna, you’re not a very nice person. "
1068,josh,Ok. Here’s what I’m gonna do. 
1070,josh,No. I’m not gonna hide in my office. I’m gonna go into my office and devise a  strategy. That is what I do. I’m a professional. I’m not a little boy. 
1072,josh,"But if she calls, I’m at the dentist. I’ll be back in an hour. "
1075,josh,"You can’t be mad at me about this, C.J."
1076,c.j.,"Really? Let’s see if I can, let’s see if I can find it in me."
1078,c.j.,Could you excuse us Donna?
1080,josh,"I don’t know, but you can kiss that raise goodbye."
1086,josh,You’re not asking me if I’d like a call girl right now are you?
1087,c.j.,Do you have any idea how serious this is?
1088,josh,"See, the thing is, I really don’t think it is that serious."
1090,josh,"A couple of things for you to bear in mind: he didn’t know she was a call girl when  he went home with her. He didn’t pay her money. He didn’t have knowledge of; witness  or participate in anything illegal. Or for that matter, unethical, immoral or suspect."
1091,c.j.,A couple of things for you to bear in mind: none of that matters on Hard Copy!
1095,c.j.,As women are prone to do?
1096,josh,That’s not what I mean.
1097,c.j.,That’s always what you mean. 
1098,josh,"I really think I’m the best judge of what I mean, you paranoid Berkeley shiksta  feminista!  Whoa. That was way too far."
1099,c.j.,"No, no. Well, I’ve got a staff meeting to go to and so do you, you elitist, Harvard  fascist missed-the-Dean’s-list-two-semesters-in-a-row Yankee jackass!"
1100,josh,"Feel better getting that off your chest there, C.J.?"
1102,josh,You look like a million bucks by the way.
1103,c.j.,Don’t try to make up with me.
1109,toby,"The longest dinner of my life. The President was up from the table every five  minutes teeing off on Cashman and Berryhill. He’s barking at the Secretary of State,  he’s scaring the hell out of Fitzwallace, which I didn’t think was possible. He’s  snapping at the First Lady. He’s talking about blowing up half of North Africa."
1110,c.j.,He’s snapping at Mrs. Bartlet?
1111,josh,C.J. this might be a good time to tell the President about Sam and the call girl.
1113,c.j.,"Yes, I’m afraid I have that information now, and I’ll be in to see you very shortly  my friend."
1114,toby,How the hell did I get into trouble?
1115,josh,"Today, all you had to do was get out of bed."
1116,bartlet,This is crap. It’s been three days. This is amateur hour.
1118,bartlet,Cashman and Berryhill are dragging their feet. Cashman and Berryhill are trying to make me look like a clown. And State should concern itself with what I damn well tell ‘em to be concerned with!
1125,bartlet," Uh, Mrs. Landingham, I can’t seem to find my glasses  anywhere. Can you please do whatever it is you do when I can’t find my glasses?"
1126,bartlet,"It’s been 72 hours Leo. That’s more than three days since they blew him out of  the sky. And I’m tired of waiting dammit! This is candy ass! We are going to draw  up a response scenario today, I’m going to give the order today, we’re going to  strike back today."
1130,bartlet,You think I’m taking this personally.
1132,bartlet,Why the hell shouldn’t I take this personally?
1134,bartlet,Americans were on that plane.
1136,bartlet,"I met Morris four or five times, let’s not do this like he was my son."
1140,bartlet,I can’t fine my glasses anywhere.
1142,bartlet, What did you want to say?
1146,bartlet,"All right, I’ll see you in an hour."
1155,c.j.,Toby said he’s snapping--
1173,toby,Sitting with military officers.
1177,toby,You better believe I’m going to take the bait.
1180,toby,There is a law against it.
1181,josh,Why’d you get him started? 
1182,toby,"How about threatening the life of the President? He was talking to other people,  how about conspiracy? Those were military officers, how about treason?!"
1184,toby,That was a member of our own party Leo. That was a   Democrat who said that!
1188,toby,Have the Justice Department bring him in for questioning pending felony charges.
1189,josh,Toby’s right. What’s the good of being in power if you’re not gonna haul your  enemies in for questioning?
1190,toby,We’re really not gonna do anything about this?
1192,toby,There is no law. There is no decency.
1193,josh,He’s just getting that now.
1197,toby,I need to know what we’re hitting.
1201,toby,"Sam, work with the coordinating State department guy."
1203,toby,And whoever the spokesperson is.
1206,josh,Not much chance of that.
1207,c.j.,We need to be fully stocked. State Department officials. Pentagon. We’ll need the Embassy Office-
1208,josh,We should get McMartin on board.
1210,josh,And Adamley at the Pentagon.
1212,josh,"So we’re all set, good. So how do we tell them what we know without telling them what we know?"
1213,c.j.,"Well we don’t know anything so that shouldn’t be hard. Oh, Samuel, could you stop  by my office around lunchtime please?"
1218,toby,Cause she told me she knows.
1220,toby,"Yeah, my office. I’ll be right back."
1224,toby,The Secret Service investigates all threats made against the President. It’s White  House policy not to comment on those investigations.
1225,toby," Damn, I gotta  get back to my office."
1226,c.j.,I think the thing to say is that we don’t think anyone here would be disappointed  if no one paid attention to the process.
1227,c.j.,Science and technology.  We’re done here.
1231,c.j.,"Really? You sussed it out, huh?  Let me tell you something  Sam, you’re a smart guy. But if you can figure it out, and I can figure it out,  what makes you think that no one in my Press Room can figure it out?"
1233,c.j.,"You can’t spend time with a call girl, you’re gonna get caught."
1235,c.j.,Don’t get cute with me.
1237,c.j.,But you called her again and went back to see her.
1239,c.j.,It doesn’t make a difference.
1241,c.j.,"You work in the White House, you work fifty feet from the Oval Office. And you’re  consorting with a..."
1244,c.j.,You’re there to make her see the error of her ways.
1246,c.j.,"I don’t care what it is, I care what it looks like."
1250,c.j.,"Yeah, I’ve heard that one before. And one other thing."
1252,c.j.,"No, Sam, when I say there’s ‘one other thing’ that means we’re not done, that  there’s one other thing."
1254,c.j.,It was tough to tell from your tone of voice.
1258,c.j.,I’m your first phone call.
1260,c.j.,"Before, now, in the future, anytime you’re into something and you don’t know what.  And you can’t tell me that you thought there was nothing to it, because you sat down  with Josh and you sat down with Toby. Anytime you’re into something and you don’t  know what, you don’t keep it from me. I’m your first phone call. I’m your first line  of defense. You have to let me protect you and you have to let me protect the President."
1262,c.j.," What this is about Sam is you’re a high profile, very visible, much noticed  member..."
1264,c.j.,You’re not going to let this out of your teeth.
1268,c.j.,"Strength, guts or courage?"
1270,c.j.,You just said three things that all mean the same thing. 
1271,c.j.,We’re done talking now. You can go. 
1273,c.j.,I really don’t know what we’re going to target Sam. The commandant of the 2nd  division doesn’t tend to include me in his thinking.
1280,bartlet,What is the virtue of a proportional response?
1281,bartlet,"What’s the virtue of a proportional response? Why’s it good?  They hit an  airplane, so we hit a transmitter, right? That’s a proportional response."
1282,bartlet,"They hit a barracks, so we hit two transmitters?"
1283,bartlet,It’s what we do. I mean this is what we do.
1285,bartlet,"Well, if it’s what we do, if it’s what we’ve always done, don’t they know we’re  going to do it?"
1287,bartlet,"I have turned my attention to Pericles One, it’s two ammo dumps, an abandoned  railroad bridge and a Syrian intelligence agency."
1288,bartlet,"But they know we’re going to do that, they know we’re going to do that. Those areas  have been abandoned for four days. We know that from the satellites. We have the  intelligence."
1290,bartlet,"They did that, so we did this, it’s the cost of doing business, it’s been factored  in, right?"
1292,bartlet,Am I right or am I missing something here?
1293,bartlet,"Then I ask again, what is the virtue of a proportional response?"
1294,bartlet,It is not all there is.
1296,bartlet,"A disproportional response. Let the word ring forth from this time and this place,  you kill an American, any American, we don’t come back with a proportional response,  we come back  with total disaster!"
1297,bartlet,"General, I am suggesting that you and Admiral Fitzwallace and Secretary Hutchinson  and the rest of the national security team take the next sixty minutes and put  together a U.S. response scenario that doesn’t make me think we are just docking  somebody’s damn allowance! "
1298,josh,"I would like a salad. I would like a soup of some kind and if you were to run across a sandwich, then hang the expense."
1300,josh,And I would like a bottle of water.
1302,josh,I’m supposed to vet you.
1303,josh,"I’m supposed to vet you, vet you; investigate to discover... if there are problems.  I’m Josh Lyman, deputy chief of staff."
1305,josh,"Charlie, you can have a seat if you like."
1308,josh,"Never mind the salad, I’m not going to eat it anyway."
1310,josh,But I would like a bottle of water as soon as humanly possible.
1312,josh,"So... have a seat.  I’m sure you understand why we have to go through  this. It’s a very sensitive job. It’s also a very hard job. Twenty-hour days aren’t  uncommon, long trips at the last minute, a lot of wait and hurry up. Moreover there  will be times when you’ll have to make yourself invisible in plain sight, as well as  an undeniable force in front of those who want more time than we’re willing to give.  Sometimes the people I’m talking about will be kings and prime ministers, you  understand so far? "
1314,josh,"Yeah, I have your paperwork."
1316,josh,"Yes, that’s because we asked Miss DiLaguardia to keep an eye out. She’s recommending  you for a different job."
1317,josh,"Personal aide to the President, and you don’t have to call me ‘Sir’."
1318,josh,"Personal aide to the President, traditionally a young guy, 20 to 25 years old,  excels academically, strong in personal responsibility and discretion, presentable  appearance."
1319,josh,"We obviously get a lot of candidates that meet those qualifications, the rest is  just gut instinct.  Or you could bribe me."
1320,josh,"Seriously Charlie, we call the President ‘Sir’ everyone else is ‘hey, when am I  gonna get that thing I asked for?’"
1324,josh,I don’t think we’re allowed to make up our own words.
1326,josh,"Change it, would you? Serious people are going to read that. "
1327,josh,"Charlie, you’re standing again."
1328,josh,Why aren’t you in college?
1329,josh,These transcripts. Your grades are better than mine.
1330,josh,"Well, no, not really, but they’re close."
1331,josh,"No, come one, I’m looking at recommendations from guidance counselors, I’m looking  at ACT scores. You didn’t want to go to college?"
1334,bartlet,"Keep your seats. There’s a delegation of cardiologists having their pictures taken  in the Blue Room. You wouldn’t think you could find a group of people more arrogant  than the fifteen of us, but there they are right upstairs in the Blue Room. You  called me?"
1335,bartlet, Does anyone have a cigarette?
1336,bartlet,Pericles One. No civilian causalities?
1337,bartlet,But you’re as certain as you can be?
1338,bartlet,And what are the military implications?
1339,bartlet,Very well.  How does this work?
1341,josh,"Charlie, I’ve got some questions here for you from the Council’s office, as well as  the Department of the Treasury and the Office of Internal Security. These questions  are all routine, there’s no cause for concern. Ready?"
1342,josh,‘Have you ever tried to overthrow the government?’
1343,josh,"Charlie, this job’s actually better than the messenger job. It pays more, you don’t  have to ride around town on a bicycle and instead of being a messenger, you get to  be personal aide to the President."
1344,josh,"Hey, Sam. This is Sam Seaborn, he’s deputy communications director. This is Charlie  Young. He’s here for Ted’s job."
1347,josh,I gotta ask you some more questions...
1350,josh,"Seriously Charlie, I have to ask you about your personal life."
1357,josh,"Charlie, I wonder if you could tell me about your social life, your friends, what  you like to do?"
1360,josh,"All right, that’s it Sam, let’s take a walk. "
1363,josh,What the hell was that about?
1365,josh,It’s not all that ridiculous.
1367,josh,It’s not like you didn’t know you’d be held to a high standard when you took this job.
1369,josh,"I gotta say Sam, digging your heels in..."
1377,c.j.,"Yeah, that’s what I hear."
1379,c.j.,What’s the estimated time?
1381,c.j.,They’re gonna wonder what all the fuss is about.
1383,c.j.,I could use a few minutes with the President at some point.
1385,c.j.,"I’m not kidding Leo, this is the..."
1393,josh,"Leo, Toby says he’s snapping at the First..."
1395,josh,"Hey Leo, can I ask you a question?"
1397,josh,"I’m interviewing this kid for Ted Miller’s job, and he’s a real special kid. He’s applied himself in school, I’m sure he’d be articulate if he wasn’t terrified. He’s  postponing college until his sister gets out of high school."
1399,josh,Father’s long gone. His mother was a uniformed cop here in D.C.
1401,josh,She was shot and killed in the line five months ago.  I really like him Leo.  I want to hire him.
1405,josh,They don’t hold the door open for the President.
1407,josh,I’m not wild about the visual. A young black man holding his overnight bag?
1411,josh,Yeah. Good.  Two hours?
1416,josh,How are you Admiral?  Josh Lyman.
1430,toby,Evening sir. Sorry I can’t stop...
1431,toby,"It’s my first bombing, I don’t know yet. "
1432,josh,"Toby, you need help with anything because..."
1434,josh,"Sheila, if you need me for anything... Standing here with absolutely nothing to do."
1435,c.j.,"I don’t know, they’re planning my surprise party."
1441,toby,Cathy! Sam cut the paragraph ten minutes ago.
1443,toby,"Standoff land attack missile. Distinguish it from the AGM 84D or Harpoon, which is  an anti-shive missile."
1447,toby,And cold-blooded. Unwarranted.
1449,toby,And cold-blooded. Great.
1460,c.j.," Admiral Fitzwallace is Chairman of the  Joint Chiefs, Leo McGarry is White House chief of staff, I’m your host C.J., let’s  play our game."
1463,c.j.,Menudo’s in the building. I gotta go.
1464,c.j.,Oh man. I’d honestly think that you of all people.
1465,c.j.,"Danny, I haven’t called a full lid, they’ll obviously be a briefing if the President  has engaged the use of military force."
1472,josh,He’s a gamer. I can pick ‘em.
1474,josh,I’ve got nothing to do.
1476,josh,"Woo! Excuse me. Everyone’s running around like the future of the world depends on it,  which I suppose it does, everyone running around, working. Me, I’ve got nothing to do."
1478,josh,I’m like a writer on a movie set.
1480,josh,"No, but I hear stories."
1482,josh, I suppose there’s some comfort in knowing that whatever’s going to  happen today has already happened.
1483,josh,I don’t understand it. Why can’t you tell me when there’s someone in my office?
1486,josh,You picked a really bad time to get psyched.
1488,josh,"You wanna say it a bit louder Mandy, I don’t Syrian Air Defense Command heard you."
1489,josh,Why are you being nice to me? 
1490,josh,It’s been pretty bad around here since it happened.
1491,josh,"The combination of American lives and Morris, the idea of using any force at all."
1492,josh,He wasn’t ready for it.
1495,josh,It’s a picture of you and me and someone’s drawn all over my face with magic marker.
1497,josh,"Well, that could have been pretty much any time, couldn’t it?"
1499,josh,"Well, you were wearing quite the ensemble that night Madeline."
1500,josh,Yeah... yeah.  They found a job for me.
1501,josh,"Listen, you’re not gonna be this nice to me when we’re working together, right?"
1502,josh,That’s what I thought.  Hey. What’s up?
1503,c.j.,"Danny, it’s gonna be much ado about nothing."
1504,c.j.,But it is that way and I just got through telling you it’s that way.
1505,c.j.,"Sam knows the difference between right and wrong and so do you. Would it make my  life easier if he wasn’t friends with this woman? Absolutely. But Sam is a grown up  and I don’t get to choose his friends and your readers don’t get to judge them. And  I’ll tell you what else, there’s something commendable about Sam’s behavior here,  don’t ask me what but there is, and I’m stickin’ by him until the President orders  me otherwise and I’m going to look very unfavorably on those who seek only to make  us look like fools."
1508,c.j.,I don’t supposed you’d tell me...
1509,c.j.,"Yeah. I’ll wait for him.  Hang on, I’m gonna give you a ten minute head  start on something."
1511,c.j., We’re out of Syrian air space.
1512,josh,This used to be the White House Council’s office ‘til Toby and the Communications  staff conquered and pillaged. The Map Room. Roosevelt Room. Oval Office. Chief of  Staff. I guess the only thing left to do is to say hello to the President.
1513,josh,We’re going on the air in a few minutes with a national address so I don’t know how  much... where the hell’d he go?  Charlie.
1514,bartlet,What happened to paragraph nine?
1516,bartlet,"I’m sorry, paragraph eight."
1518,toby,You have to read between the lines.
1519,bartlet,"Well, I want to see it again."
1520,toby,You should look at the new paragraph.
1521,bartlet,I can’t look at anything fellas. Mrs. Landingham! I need my glasses!
1523,bartlet,When do we get the BDA?
1527,toby,Ordinarily we get help from inside the Syrian Intelligence.
1529,toby,We just blew up the Syrian Intelligence.
1530,bartlet,"Oh, for crying out loud, will somebody get on the phone to CNN and find out if we  hit anything!"
1531,bartlet,Thank you! Now if I had my glasses.
1532,bartlet,"This has been since this morning, we could have brought in an optometrist by now."
1533,bartlet,"I don’t need an optometrist now, thank you Nancy. I just need to glasses he  prescribed."
1534,c.j.," Mr. President, if you’ll take a minute or two to familiarize yourself with  the phoenix."
1535,bartlet,I got the briefing on the phoenix.
1536,c.j.,You understand that I’m not talking about the sidewinder.
1537,bartlet,"The phoenix. I got the briefing on the phoenix last night, I studied the report,  Hutchinson was there, in my private study. "
1541,bartlet,For want of a pair of glasses.
1544,toby,"While they’re looking sir, in the meantime can you take a look at the new paragraph?"
1545,bartlet,"Aw, crap. I can’t see anything with those."
1548,bartlet,What of it? Who is this?
1549,josh,"Mr. President, this is Charles Young..."
1550,bartlet,I don’t have anytime for new people now!
1554,bartlet," Did you know that two thousand years ago a Roman citizen could walk across  the face of the known world free of the fear of molestation? He could walk across  the earth unharmed, cloaked only in the words ‘Civis Romanis’ I am a Roman citizen.  So great was the retribution of Rome, universally understood as certain, should any  harm befall even one of its citizens. Where was Morris’ protection, or anyone else  on that plane? Where is the retribution for the families and where is the warning to  the rest of the world that Americans shall walk this earth unharmed, lest the  clenched fist of the most mighty military force in the history of mankind comes  crashing down on your house!? In other words, Leo, what the hell are we doing here?"
1556,bartlet,"Well our behavior has produced some pretty crappy results. In fact, I’m not a  hundred percent sure it hasn’t induced them."
1558,bartlet,"I’m talking about two hundred and eight-six American marines in Beirut, I’m talking  about Somalia, I’m talking about Nairobi."
1562,bartlet,He had a ten-day-old baby at home.
1564,bartlet,We are doing nothing. They dest...
1568,bartlet,Which they’ll rebuild again in six months.
1570,bartlet,Why didn’t you say so?  When I think of all the work you did to get me elected.  I could pommel your ass with a baseball bat. 
1572,bartlet,"Oh, I like anything that starts with ‘Bertram Coles’. Let’s have it."
1576,bartlet,Ziegler must be ballistic.
1578,bartlet,"Oh, by the way, who was that kid before? The one who figured out where my glasses are?"
1581,josh,"This was just, I think, a bad day. I have to tell you, he’s ordinarily an extremely  kind man placing a very high premium on civility. Today, it’s just been a difficult  few days for him."
1582,bartlet," Excuse me Charlie. Can I see you inside please? Come on,  it’s okay. "
1583,bartlet,"But you prefer Charlie, right? Listen, Leo McGarry filled me in on the situation  with your mother, I’m so very sorry. I hope you don’t mind but I took the liberty  of calling Tom Connolly, the FBI Director. We had the computer spit out some quick  information, you’re mother was killed by a Western .38 Revolver firing K.T.W.s, or  what are known as ‘Cop Killer bullets’, now we have not had a whole lot of success  banning that weapon and those bullets off the streets, but we’re planning on taking  a big whack at it when Congress gets back from recess. So, what do you say, you  wanna come help us out?"
1588,bartlet,My granddaughter gave me this tie.
1590,bartlet,Get away from me. Somebody throw this guy out of the building!
1592,bartlet,"My fellow Americans, good evening. A short while ago I ordered our Armed Forces to  attack and destroy four military targets in Northern Syria, this in response to the  unwarranted, unprovoked..."
1593,bartlet,"One night he went in and set the briefcase down and said, “Bess, why do you suppose  it is that only sons-of-bitches know how to lick a stamp?”  The point is, friends, you’ve got to write the letter, you’ve got to send a fax,  you’ve got to pick up the phone and call Western Union. You’ve got to contact your  Congressional representative..."
1594,bartlet,"You’ve got to say “Mister, I’ve got a friend who’s neighbor is dead..."
1596,bartlet,"“...Madam, I’ve got a neighbor whose friend is dead, whose husband is dead, whose  mother is dead, kids are dead! Kids are dead!"
1598,bartlet,"“...and I wanna know, mister. I wanna know, madam..."
1600,bartlet,"...how you intend to vote on Wednesday, so that I’ll know how to vote next election...”"
1602,bartlet,You gotta ask ‘em. You gotta ask ‘em! 
1609,bartlet,"You know, I had a civil procedure professor who said once..."
1610,toby,Take a beat.  There you go.
1611,bartlet,"He said, “When the law is on your side, argue the law; and when the facts are on  your side, argue the facts..."
1613,bartlet,"...When you don’t have the law on your side, when you don’t have the facts on your  side, bang your fist on the defense table as loud as you can.” Well, we’ve got the  law on our side now, and we’ve got the facts on our side now..."
1614,josh,"Yeah, this is Josh Lyman. Please call me. I need to know what happened."
1615,bartlet,"...bang our fist on the defense table, but we’re not listening any more. We’re not  having that any more. We’re gonna win on Wednesday. We’re gonna win on Wednesday!  Thank you all.  God bless you, and God bless America!"
1627,toby,"Yeah, I said it was fine."
1632,toby,Because Sam wrote two and a half paragraphs and I wrote thirty-seven pages.
1635,c.j.,I thought it was inspired.
1636,toby,Why do you keep saying stuff like that to me?
1638,c.j.," Hey, your little fan club was out in full force tonight."
1639,josh,"Well, they like me in my tux."
1640,c.j.,Do you think I have an unusually large neck?
1642,c.j.,"I’m just asking, ‘cause one of the..."
1645,josh,I want you to look calm while I’m telling you this. 
1649,josh,802. Five votes jumped the fence.
1653,josh,"Leo just got off the phone with the whip. Last nose count, we’re five votes down."
1654,c.j.,What the hell happened?
1666,bartlet,Thank you. Good night.  Toby!
1669,toby,"I thought my work was outstanding, Mr. President. "
1671,toby,Thanks for asking.  Couldn’t help but notice you got a little extemporaneous  there in the D section. 
1672,bartlet,"Oh, you noticed that, did you?"
1674,bartlet,Yes. I did a little polish right up there on my feet.
1676,bartlet,"Right in front of everybody. I looked to the side at one point, you know. I half  expected to see you coming at me with a salad fork."
1677,toby,"Well, but for the secret service agents restraining me, sir."
1678,bartlet,Yup. Thank God for the secret service.
1680,bartlet," Hey there, fella. She deserves a nice  room and some supper."
1681,toby,"You like doing that, don’t you sir?"
1683,bartlet,What’d you think of the speech?
1685,toby,"He means the text of the speech, Charlie, discounting the little improv in the  D section."
1686,bartlet,"I mean the entire speech, Charlie, and in particular the delivery."
1687,bartlet,"See, I think what Charlie’s trying to say is that in this case the singer  outdistanced the song."
1688,toby,"Really. Well, what I heard Charlie say was that the text was user-proof, although  you did your level best to disprove that in the D section."
1691,bartlet,You’re what my mother calls a pain in the ass.
1692,toby,"Well, that’s what my mother calls it too, sir."
1693,bartlet,"Yes, Charlie. By the way, did the First Lady call? "
1695,bartlet,Those damn things make me goofy.
1696,bartlet,"You don’t have to describe her tone to me, Charlie. I’ve been married to it for  32 years."
1697,bartlet,"Give me the medicine, Charlie.  Thank you. Have a good night. I’ll see you in the morning."
1700,c.j., It helps not to know him!
1701,c.j.,"Leo, your food’s getting cold. Want me to bring it over? "
1702,josh, Isn’t my food getting cold too? 
1704,c.j.,Oh thanks. Try some of this.
1706,c.j.,"Yum! Oh, Sam, you gotta try the General Chow’s chicken."
1709,c.j.,You didn’t try it with the sauce.
1710,toby,Will the two of you... shut up?
1711,toby,I’m really very happy with the food that I’ve got.
1715,josh,Everyone’s someplace else. All I got was O’Bannon. 
1721,josh,It’s got to be a mistake. Who told you that?
1723,josh,They’ve got bad information. There is no way Chris Wick jumped the fence.
1725,toby,How do we do that without making noise?
1731,josh,"What are you worth there, Toby?"
1732,toby," Well, I own this tuxedo, and I’ve got twenty-three bucks in my pocket."
1735,toby,"It’s a pretty humiliating way of taking one for the team, isn’t it?"
1736,toby,I found that. I found that women especially can’t get enough of my 1993 Dodge Dart.
1747,josh,Tillinghouse and the Vice...
1763,toby,I honestly couldn’t say.
1765,toby,And I’m saying I really couldn’t say. I have no background or education in the  stock market. I’m a speechwriter.
1766,toby,"I can tell you, Leela. Ask the Treasury Secretary. Ask the Chairman of the Federal  Reserve. I’m a total novice at this. "
1767,toby,I have never owned a share of stock until last year. 
1768,toby,I use the website. I like the company.
1770,toby,"Leela, I’m as surprised as anybody. I didn’t know until the accountant called your  office."
1771,toby,Of course I didn’t. I’m telling you that I’ve never paid any attention...
1776,toby,"Leela, I’ve got forty-eight hours to a crucial floor vote. Is there any way that...?"
1777,toby,I grew up on the same block as Ted McGregor. He’s very well respected-
1778,toby,"I’m telling you that not only didn’t I know what he was going to say to the  committee, not only didn’t I care what he was going to say to the committee, but  if he had sat in my office while I typed up his testimony for him.  I wouldn’t have understood what he was going to say to the committee!"
1781,toby,Are you saying I should be talking to a lawyer?
1782,josh,So what’s the range of what we’re talking about?
1783,josh,"Thanks, Mrs. Landingham."
1793,josh,We do it by giving away nothing in the store.
1797,josh,"L.B.J. never would’ve taken this kind of crap from Democrats in Congress. He’d have  said, “You’re voting my way, in exchange for which, it is possible that I might  remember your name.”  Pal, we need to win. And I mean win. We need  to take a curtain call and a victory lap. And that’s how we get momentum. We get it  by being tough. We give away nothing. That’s what I’m taking to Leo."
1799,josh,"Chris Wick, I own his ass."
1800,josh,I sense I’m being mocked.
1810,josh,"Well, Sarah was very fond of me."
1812,josh,"All right, this was fun, but Sam and I are busy making critical decisions, and I’m  sure you have a lot of typing to do. So I’ll talk to you later."
1814,josh,I’ll take care of Chris Wick.
1818,josh,"I was following you.  All right, don’t tell anyone this happened, okay?"
1819,toby,Sam! I’ve got a problem. I need to talk to you for a few minutes.
1837,josh,You thinking about taking lessons?
1839,josh,"Gets a little weird after a minute, doesn’t it?"
1841,josh,Is it Jenny’s birthday?
1843,josh,In that case I’d shift into gear and bring on the Julliard String Quartet.
1847,josh,I’m going to see Katzenmoyer.
1851,josh,Nothing more than a wake up call. I want your permission to kick his ass.
1855,josh,I wanna let him hear the branch creak.
1857,josh,"If it doesn’t work, I back off. If it doesn’t work, we give Katzenmoyer a metro link  and we let O’Bannon order off the menu. If it does work, I think we get the other  four votes no problem when word gets out we’re not screwing around."
1859,josh,"Your constituents like the Tech 9 and the Rutger Mini 14, do they? They go quail  hunting with an Uzi?"
1860,josh,And you’re not doing so well.
1861,josh,"Fifty-five thousand more people will be shot and killed with guns two years from now,  but that’s very much beside the point."
1862,josh,"Forgive my bluntness, and I say this with all due respect, Congressman, but vote yes,  or you’re not even going to be on the ballot two years from now."
1863,josh,You’re going to lose in the primary.
1866,josh,"Doesn’t seem to be doing us much good now, does it? "
1867,josh,"No sir. We’re going to do it in person. See, you won with fifty-two percent, but the  President took your district with fifty-nine. And I think it’s high time we come back  and say thanks. Do you have any idea how much noise Air Force One makes when it lands  in Eau Claire, Wisconsin? We’re going to have a party, Congressman. You should come,  it’s gonna be great. And when the watermelon’s done, right in town square, right in  the band gazebo... You guys got a band gazebo?"
1868,josh,"Doesn’t matter, we’ll build one. Right in the band gazebo, that’s where the President  is going to drape his arm around the shoulder of some assistant DA we like. And you  should have your camera with you. You should get a picture of that. ‘Cause that’s  gonna be the moment you’re finished in Democratic politics. President Bartlet’s a  good man. He’s got a good heart. He doesn’t hold a grudge. "
1870,toby,Could you stop saying that!?
1872,toby,How much trouble am I in?
1874,toby,Talk about actual trouble.
1882,toby," All right, let’s move away from actual trouble for a second and  let’s talk about..."
1886,toby,Say nothing of damaging to the President.
1888,toby,Why are you talking like this?
1890,toby,I totally backed you up on that!
1894,toby,Anyone who saw the report.
1897,toby,I am so... completely screwed.
1898,c.j.,"145 dollar Armani cravat, which I’m pretty sure is a necktie. It was a gift from  his brother-in-law. He gave it away to the Salvation Army. Information I’m sure the  President would prefer his brother-in-law did not have. "
1899,c.j.,Secret Service improvements.
1900,c.j.,The property now includes a helipad and the ability to run a global war from the  sun porch. 
1901,c.j.,"That’s all for now, folks. Later this afternoon we’ll do Deputy Chief of Staff  Joshua Lyman. "
1903,c.j.,They really can’t get enough of you.
1906,josh,Along with O’Bannon and LeBrandt.
1908,josh,"Chris Wick’s waiting for me right now. I don’t know what his story is, but I’m not  that worried."
1909,c.j.,You worried about Tillinghouse?
1910,josh,I can’t get him without the Vice President. Leo’s got to lighten up on that.
1911,c.j.,Get Wick first. And then we’ll deal with it. 
1923,josh,"Actually, it only served as a colossal waste of time and energy. Keep up the good work."
1925,josh,"Right.  Guys, could you wait outside for a minute, please. The Congressman  and I want to talk about old times."
1926,josh," Is that supposed to impress me, you have a staff?"
1927,josh,I told the House minority whip he was crazy. No way is Chris Wick jumping the fence.  Do you have any idea how stupid this makes me look?
1928,josh,"Shove it, dude. We’re not in a frat house anymore. "
1929,josh,Name for me please the weapons banned in this bill and why you feel they should be  legal.
1930,josh,Let’s start here. Name for me please the weapons banned in this bill.
1933,josh,The PCR. NFR. Anything ring a bell?
1934,josh,They’re both copycats of the AR 15 assault rifle that was banned two years ago.  It’s the exact same gun.
1935,josh,It’s back. They just changed the grip. How ‘bout the Pat Maxi?
1936,josh, It’s a grenade launcher!
1937,josh,"You know, I realize as an adult not everyone shares my view of the world. And with  an issue as hot as gun control I’m prepared to accept a lot of different points of  view as being perfectly valid. But we can all get together on the grenade launcher,  right?"
1938,josh,I put you in your seat. I got you elected to the House of Representatives.
1940,josh,You’re voting down a measure that would restrict the sale of deadly weapons because  nobody invited you to the cool kid’s table?
1941,josh,"You know, I’m so sick of Congress I could vomit.   What do you want?"
1942,josh,President doesn’t play golf.
1944,josh,"He’s going to kick your ass, you know."
1945,josh,"Chris, you’re a Congressman. You’ve gotta make that real. This time it was me in  the Mural Room. Trust me when I tell you, you do not wanna have this conversation  with the guy who works next door. "
1954,toby,Could we possibly talk about me?
1955,c.j.,Are you saying I’m going to stretch it?
1956,josh," Leo, I got four out of five. I’m absolutely convinced we need the Vice  President to get Tillinghouse."
1957,c.j.,We’re all agreed on that.
1963,josh,The entire caucus. Let’s not get ‘em any more pissed off at us than they are already.
1965,josh,You have to do it quietly and right now.
1967,josh,Call me as soon as you’ve got it. 
1970,toby,There’s literally no one in the world that I don’t hate right now. 
1980,josh,There are people who like me.
1982,josh,Yeah Leo. We’re going to set up a meeting for you with the Vice President.   Good.
2022,josh,Yes. A smoking jacket and a cigarette holder. Both declared items. I am clean as a whistle.
2023,josh,"I’m sensing trouble, but I can’t quite..."
2024,josh,"Ah, there it was, right in front of my face."
2026,josh,They weren’t by way of saying “Thanks for sleeping with me” if that’s what you mean.
2029,josh,Hoynes is having breakfast with Tillinghouse.
2030,josh,I really thought a nice by-product of not going out with you anymore would be that  you wouldn’t yell at me anymore.
2049,bartlet,Absolutely no need. I’m fine. What’s going on here?
2051,bartlet,I like to...  ...get involved.
2052,c.j.,Mr. President. Did you by any chance take your back pills?
2053,bartlet,I don’t mind telling you C.J. I was in a little pain there.
2055,bartlet,I wasn’t supposed to take ‘em both?
2056,c.j.,"Okay. Mr. President, we’re going to have someone take you back to bed."
2057,bartlet,No no no. Sit sit sit. 
2059,bartlet,"Sam, of course you are."
2060,toby,"Sir. Sir... The situation basically is this. I arranged for a friend to testify  to Commerce on Internet stocks while simultaneously, but unrelated to that, bought  a technology issue which, partly due to my friend’s testimony, shot through the roof."
2061,bartlet,"Toby.  Toby’s a nice name, don’t you think?"
2062,toby, Could we possibly do this meeting at another time?
2063,bartlet,"No, no, no, no. Please, Leo. I know my body. I mean, you know, my muscles are not,  you know, but my mind is sharp. I can focus. I’m focused. You all know that about me.  Here’s what I think we ought to do...  Was I just saying something?"
2067,bartlet,Hot damn! Now you’re talking.
2068,toby,"I think she meant me, Mr. President."
2072,toby,I’ve got a lawyer from the White House Counsel’s office-
2081,toby,"No, no, it’s not good. Actually, it stinks."
2082,bartlet,"Toby, you’re a great writer, do you know that?"
2083,toby,"Well, thank you very much sir."
2086,bartlet,Come on. Give us a hug.  There you go.
2088,bartlet,Charlie’s a great name.
2089,bartlet,I’m going. I’m going.   I’m seriously thinking about getting a dog.
2091,bartlet,"Maybe an Irish setter, Charlie. What do you think? "
2093,toby, Like I just got screwed with my pants on.
2097,c.j.,"Sorry, Leo. You saw this one coming through the Holland Tunnel."
2105,c.j.,"Let’s leave it till tomorrow, Toby. Let’s leave it till tomorrow. "
2106,josh, Evening Mr. Vice President.
2107,josh,Are you talking about the bill or are you talking about my smoking jacket?
2109,josh,"No, it is. I should know. I helped write it."
2110,josh,I’d say it’s roughly the equivalent of fighting the war against tobacco by banning  certain color matchbook covers.
2111,josh,"I’d say you did well, sir. In fact, you might be the only one who did. I just came  by to say congratulations."
2118,bartlet,Why would I want to do that?
2119,josh,Cause people are bound to be pretty upset when they find out we killed the President.
2121,bartlet,"All right, game point. Let’s go."
2124,toby,"Mr. President, there’s no shame in calling it quits. All you have to do is say,  “Toby, you’re the superior athlete,” and slink on off the court."
2125,bartlet,"Take the ball out, Toby."
2126,toby,You’re really going to keep playing?
2127,bartlet,Take the ball out. Let’s go.
2128,toby,"Oh, this is perfect, you know that? This is a perfect metaphor. After you’re gone,  and the poets write, “The Legend of Josiah Bartlet,” let them write you as a tragic  figure, sir. Let the poets write that he had the tools of greatness, but the voices  of his better angels was shouted down by his obsessive need to win."
2129,bartlet,You want to play or write my eulogy?
2130,toby,"Can I be honest with you, sir?"
2132,josh,Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Who’s this guy?
2133,bartlet,I’m making a substitution.
2135,bartlet,Mr. Grant’s a new member of my team.
2137,bartlet,Mr. Grant is a federal employee.
2138,toby,"You know the thing about you, Mr. President? It isn’t so much that you cheat. It’s  how brazenly bad you are at it."
2140,josh,Toby’s got a point there sir.
2141,bartlet,When have I ever cheated?
2142,toby,"Up on Florida, playing mixed doubles with me and C.J. You tried to tell us that your  partner worked at the American Consulate in Vienna."
2144,toby,"It was Steffi Graf, sir."
2145,bartlet,"Well, I will admit that the woman bore a striking resemblance..."
2146,toby,"It was Steffi Graf, you crazy lunatic! You think I’m not gonna recognize Steffi Graf  when she’s serving a tennis ball at me?"
2147,josh,"Steffi Graf’s won quite a few championships, sir. We’ve had many opportunities to  see photographs."
2148,bartlet,"Be that as it may, Toby Ziegler, Josh Lyman, Charlie Young. I would like to  introduce Mr. Rodney Grant. Mr. Grant is Associate Director of the President’s  Council on Physical Fitness. Game point. Your ball. Let’s go!"
2153,toby,"Mr. Grant, your name sounds awfully familiar... Before you joined up with the  President’s Council on Physical Fitness, a council, I might add, the President would  do well to avail himself of... Is it possible, that you played some organized ball?"
2156,toby,This guy was in the Final Four!
2157,bartlet,"Take the ball out, Toby. Game point. Let’s go."
2160,toby, I’m taking you to the hole.
2163,bartlet,"Let the poets write about that there, Byron."
2164,toby,"Charlie, guard the new guy."
2166,josh,That’s... where I’m going.
2168,josh,"Yes, but you see that’s obviously where I’m going, and yet you tell me anyway."
2170,josh,That you seek to control me?
2178,josh,"Right.  Can we clear up a few things about my  level of interest in the revolving door of local gomers that you see, in the free  time you create by not working very hard at your job?"
2180,josh,You work hard at your job.
2184,josh,Not at all controlling.
2194,josh,"I don’t know. But this is the White House, so it’s probably not that important."
2197,c.j.,There’s an article I want you to read in the New Yorker.
2201,c.j.,"No, the dessert topping, Josh."
2205,toby,We’ve done it twice in 12 months.
2207,toby,It’s “Throw Open Our Office Doors To People Who Want To Discuss Things That We  Could Care Less About... Day”
2210,toby, Sadly you’re about to find out.
2214,toby,"Leo, wouldn’t this time be better spent plotting a war against a country that can’t  possibly defend itself against us?"
2225,josh," Sorry, we’re late. Is it “Total Crackpot Day” again?"
2229,josh,"Yeah, I know. Donna told me."
2240,josh, They told me that a minute... What’s the card do?
2242,josh," Sure...well,um...Okay, I really, um, I don’t know what to say."
2244,josh,Sure. Sure...and my staff goes with me or do they have separate...?
2245,josh, And I think the best thing to do is just forget all about it. I’ll go now.
2247,bartlet,"No, Helen, I don’t. The U.S. economy is fundamentally..."
2249,bartlet,From the... Miami Herald?
2251,bartlet,"But, your voice sounded the same as when you did Helen."
2253,bartlet,"No, not at all. The U.S. economy remains fundamentally strong as the steady decline  in unemployment reflects, which I think is cause for satisfaction, not gloom. The  solitary aberrant spike in the P.P.I. is not cause for overreaction."
2255,bartlet,"I AM an economics professor with a big old stick up my butt, but I’ll do my best for  you there, Mandy."
2258,bartlet,We don’t need to do guns.
2259,toby,"Sir, they are absolutely gonna ask about guns."
2260,bartlet,"I’m not saying they’re not gonna ask about them, Toby. I’m saying I’m all set."
2261,toby,"How ‘bout one or two questions, Mr. President?"
2262,bartlet, Is it time for my 10 a.m. scolding?
2271,bartlet,Ah! Mr. Ziegler from the Coney Island Killjoy. You have a follow up?
2272,toby,"You’re gonna take the question. We’re lucky enough to get the question, you’re  gonna take it and blow it off?"
2274,toby,"Due respect, sir, may I ask why?"
2275,bartlet,‘Cause I’m weak-willed and stupid.
2277,toby,"Four days ago sir, we talked this over."
2278,bartlet,Then I talked it over with some other people.
2280,bartlet,I have lots of other people.
2281,toby,"Sir, I believe we are missing a huge opportunity here..."
2285,josh,"Oh, we’re doing the thing."
2286,c.j.,Why aren’t you in there?
2288,c.j.,"Good morning, Mrs. Landingham. Where are we in the saga of Toby and the President?"
2289,c.j.,A disagreement or a fight?
2294,bartlet,I’m not gonna come out and say the bill we just passed is worthless.
2295,toby,If we could just admit its weaknesses.
2297,bartlet,"Yeah, my answer was gonna be “because I said so,” but you did pretty good."
2299,toby,"By changing some words, the world can move or not by changing some words."
2301,toby,"I have many points, sir. I choose not to make them right now."
2302,bartlet," Well, on behalf of everybody in the west wing, Toby, let me just  say that that’s a relief."
2312,c.j.,This is a very important press conference.
2315,bartlet, I think this press conference is about we haven’t had a press  conference in a while.
2334,c.j.,You don’t have to worry about me on Hollywood fund-raisers. You have to worry about  Toby.
2336,c.j.,This wasn’t the one we used during the primary?
2337,c.j.,Where was the one where Roberto Benigni pushed me into this swimming pool?
2338,c.j.,"Which would be fine if Roberto Benigni can vote in our elections, but since he’s  Italian, that makes me a six foot wet girl in a Donna Karan dress."
2340,bartlet,Leo’s not talking about the portion being accounted for as off budget and  particularly not the long-term capital outlays.
2342,bartlet,"Ten years ago, the federal budget had a deficit of 22 billion dollars but the  national debt rose... "
2344,bartlet, Zoey’s coming for dinner.
2346,bartlet,"Yeah.  My daughter’s starting Georgetown after the first and  she’s scouting off-campus housing. Guys, we’re done. I’m sorry, but some of my staff  has been waiting and they haven’t had the chance to bother me for a couple of hours.  Thanks so much."
2349,bartlet,I’ll make it for everybody. Charlie!
2351,bartlet,"My friends, my daughter, my beer, and some chili. Yes!"
2353,bartlet,"Ah, Charlie. My youngest daughter, Zoey, is down from Hanover. I’m making chili  tonight. It’s her favorite."
2354,bartlet,The first lady’s in Pakistan. I can eat whatever I want.
2355,bartlet,I’m gonna need some ingredients.
2357,bartlet,"Don’t ever listen to him. Look, Mrs. Landingham’s got it all written down somewhere.  Just tell her to give it to the steward’s office. And send everyone else in."
2362,bartlet,"Everyone! Come in. Come on in. Hey, listen up everybody. Zoey’s down from Hanover.  I’m making chili for everyone tonight."
2363,bartlet, All right...You know what? Let’s do this. Everybody  look down at the big seal in the middle of my carpet.
2364,bartlet,"Now, everybody look back up at me. Zoey’s coming down from Hanover and I’m making  chili for everyone tonight."
2365,bartlet,"There, you see how benevolent I can be, when everyone does what I tell them to do.  Now sit down. "
2369,toby,‘Cause 24 hours earlier the President’s gonna give a speech to the entertainment  industry on violence in film and television.
2371,toby,That’s beside the point.
2372,toby,Larry Posner’s movies are incredibly violent.
2374,toby,"No, actually, what I mean to say is Larry Posner’s movies are indicative of a  Hollywood that is excessibly violent, arrogantly violent, and is promoting violence  and the disrespect to human life. Either way, I don’t see how we can admonish  Hollywood on a Tuesday and cash their check on a Wednesday. How can we do that?"
2375,bartlet, Cause it’s Hollywood. Who gives a damn?
2376,toby,"Now, hang on a second, Mr. President, you have me drafting a speech for the  entertainment industry, where we more than suggest to come right out and say that  much of their product is corruptive. Now are we doing this because we believe that  it’s time for them to take moral leadership seriously or are we doing it because  nobody ever lost an election attacking Hollywood?"
2378,toby," That’s not hypocritical, sir?"
2381,bartlet,"Because Sam is right. It’s not that Larry Posner’s movies have gratuitous sex and  gratuitous violence. It’s that they suck. They’re terrible. But people go to see them  because they have gratuitous sex and gratuitous violence. Now, if we could just get  people to stop going to see crappy movies, Posner would stop making them. I promise you."
2382,toby,"How’s that strategy working for us in the war on drugs, sir?"
2384,toby,"We are going to go out there and implore these people to step up to the plate and not  be quite so casual with the awesome influence that they have. That’s fantastic. But,  sir, every time someone makes headlines by blowing thunder at this ridiculous target,  it only serves as a criminal distraction in the pursuit of actual solutions. Now, let  me just say one other thing. If I were an actor, a writer, or a director, or a producer  in Hollywood and someone would start coming at me with a list of things that were  American and un-American, I’d start to think that this was sounding eerily familiar."
2385,bartlet," Do I look like Joe McCarthy to you, Toby?"
2386,toby,No sir. Nobody ever looks like Joe McCarthy. That’s how they get in the door in the  first place.
2387,c.j.,We seem to have wandered off the point a bit.
2389,c.j.,"Thank you, Mr. President."
2400,josh,Are we spending any time working on UFOs?
2402,josh,‘Cause coming on the heels of Mrs. Bartlet’s Ouija board...
2408,josh,"Listen, you’re close with Cathy, right?"
2410,josh," No, Sam. Well, that’s not what I’m asking."
2418,josh,"Right.  When they gave you a card and they told you... that it was just you  and not Cathy, how did you... how’d you feel about that?"
2420,josh,The N.S.C. guy... the card with the directions.
2422,josh,"You, C.J., Toby. I’m saying when the N.S.C. guy gave you your cards."
2427,c.j.,And you’re gonna tell me her story? 
2428,c.j.,"Sure, ‘cause no photo I.D. "
2431,c.j.,That helps explain Buckingham Palace. 
2433,c.j., The wolves-only roadway?
2434,c.j., An 1800-mile wolves-only roadway?
2435,c.j.,Hang on. How are you gonna teach wolves to follow road signs?
2436,c.j.,"Yeah, but in the meantime, Pluie’s gonna get drunk and wander off the wolves-only  road and end up eating my cat."
2437,c.j.,I don’t think this is gonna happen. 
2438,c.j.,"First of all, ranchers don’t want wolves returned to the West."
2439,c.j.,"No, they’re not. And anyone who says it should take it back. Ranchers face the  following conditions: falling stock prices, rising taxes, prolonged drought, and  a country that’s eating less beef. Ranchers want to blame something, and because  they’re ranchers, they want to fight something. I’d rather be a wolf than us, so  unless Pluie registers to vote..."
2440,c.j.,I’m... sorry to hear that.
2441,c.j.," Just out of curiosity, how much would it cost?"
2442,c.j.," No, seriously, how much would it cost?"
2445,c.j.,Nine hundred million dollars?
2446,c.j.,How about we build the nine best schools in the world?
2448,toby,"What’d you get him, a spot on Hollywood Squares?"
2451,toby,I don’t like going up against you.
2454,toby,Remember a month ago when I asked you if I was the President’s first choice?
2456,toby,And you called me paranoid?
2458,toby,And a nudnik. You called me a paranoid nudnik.
2459,c.j.,"Toby, for the 48th time, you are not the President’s second choice."
2460,toby,What about David Rosen?
2461,c.j.,What about David Rosen?
2462,toby,"Mandy was just in my office, and she said she was happy David Rosen passed on my job."
2463,c.j.,"Carol, we’re gonna start in a few minutes."
2466,c.j.,"I don’t... Toby, I know nothing about David Rosen, and I don’t know where this is  coming from."
2467,toby,He’s about to have a press conference. Let me talk to him about the gun thing.  We’ll just leave Hollywood for some other time.
2468,c.j.,Since when do you need help talking to the President?
2469,toby,Since all of a sudden I became the kid in the class with his hand raised that nobody  wants the teacher to call on.
2474,josh,"So, like I said, I appreciate you squeezing me in like this."
2475,josh,You shouldn’t have Stan. It’s not a big deal.
2476,josh,"Uh, I’m out of practice."
2477,josh,"Well, I think the idea will make some people I work for nervous. "
2478,josh,"Hmm. This is gonna sound silly.  There’s a magazine article... a magazine  article came out... and it said that several countries, some of them are enemies,  have stored in freezers the smallpox virus."
2479,josh,No...Don’t laugh.  I can’t get “Ave Maria” out of my head.
2480,josh,"Yeah, I swear it. I’ve been humming it to myself all morning. It’s the strangest  thing... Why do you think the “Ave Maria?”"
2481,josh,"I don’t know... My sister used to play it over and over in her room, but that was,  I don’t know how many years ago."
2483,josh,"She liked music... a lot. She liked it a lot. She wanted to be an orchestra conductor.  She used to pretend she was conducting the music. Anyway, there’s that. Plus, I have  to tell you. I was a little thrown off this morning when they gave me this card. And  it turns out that I was the only one who got one. I mean, of my friends. It surprised  me... Joanie and Toby and C.J. and Sam."
2485,josh,"I meant... No, ‘cause we were just talking about Joanie."
2486,josh,"It was uh... there really are some things I’m not allowed to talk about. I assure  you, I’m not withholding anything I’m supposed to be emotionally available for."
2489,josh,"It’s really not a big deal, Stanley. I’m sorry I had you cancel an appointment."
2490,josh,It was an impulse. I wasted your time.
2493,josh,"It’s not a big deal.  Uh, she was babysitting for me,  and there was a fire."
2494,josh,I honestly... I don’t remember... Something about a popcorn maker.
2497,josh,I ran out of the house.
2499,c.j.,Josh? I was knocking but you didn’t answer.
2500,josh,I didn’t hear the door.
2502,josh,I think I’m ready to brief the President on the smallpox article.
2503,c.j.,"Why don’t you forget about that for tonight, and come have some chili? Everyone’s  there."
2504,josh,"C.J., an N.S.C. staffer gave me a card with instructions on it for what I’m supposed  to do in the event of a nuclear attack. They want me up in the plane or down on a  bunker. They don’t want you... or Sam, or Toby, for that matter. I didn’t want to be  friends with you and have you not know."
2505,c.j.,"Josh, have you been upset about this?"
2507,c.j.,You’re very sweet sometimes. You really are.
2508,c.j.,"Of course, they don’t want me, Josh. I’m a press secretary. I don’t think they’re  gonna be issuing a whole lot of releases. Sam and Toby are communications and my  guess is that speech writing won’t be a priority either. Come, have some fun. "
2509,josh, This is a beautiful piece of music. Do you know this?
2511,josh,"Hang on. Listen. Listen.  Schubert was crazy, you know."
2513,josh,Do you think you have to be crazy to create something powerful?
2514,c.j.,"Josh, the cold war is over. There’s not gonna be a nuclear..."
2515,josh,"God, C.J. It’s not gonna be like that. It’s not gonna be the red phone and nuclear  bombs."
2517,josh,"It’s gonna be this. It’s gonna be something like this. Smallpox has been gone for  50 years. No one has an acquired immunity. Flies through the air. You get it...  you carry a ten foot cloud around with you. One in three people die. If 100 people  in New York City got it, you’d have to encircle them with 100 million vaccinated  people to contain it. Do you know how many doses of smallpox vaccines exist in the  country? Seven. If 100 people in New York City get it, there’s gonna be a global  medical emergency that’s gonna make HIV look like cold and flu season. That’s how  it’s gonna be, a little test tube with a-a rubber cap that’s deteriorating... A guy  steps out of Times Square Station. Pshht... Smashes it on the sidewalk... There is  a world war right there."
2518,c.j.,We’ll make more vaccine. 
2519,josh,You better hurry ‘cause I’m the only one with one of these cards.
2520,c.j.,Come have chili. The President’s asking for you.
2521,josh,"Yeah, I’ll be right there in a minute."
2522,c.j.,You really are very sweet sometimes. 
2523,bartlet,"Sam, it’s all about mastering the fundamentals, see? Got to keep your hands up,  your feet moving on defense. Pass and get open or find the open man, and follow his  shot on offense. See, I am a master of fundamentals, and that is why my team so  thoroughly dominated your team."
2525,bartlet," Leo, kids don’t understand the fundamentals."
2527,bartlet,"Mrs. Landingham, are you drunk?"
2529,bartlet,"Oh, give it up. Where’s Zoey? "
2530,c.j.,Wolves don’t kill people. That’s a myth.
2531,toby,Where along the way did she turn into a wolf person?
2532,c.j.,More people get killed getting change out of vending machines than get killed by  a wolf attack.
2533,c.j.,Number of people killed last year retrieving change from a vending machine: four.  Number of people killed by a wolf attack: zero.
2534,toby, Excuse me. One second.
2536,toby," So, I guess we haven’t been getting along too well lately.  Have we, sir?"
2538,toby,I’ve been... irritating you?
2540,toby,Was David Rosen your first choice for my job?
2542,toby,"Well, I’m glad we had this little talk, sir. I feel a lot better. Thank you, sir. "
2543,bartlet,"We were up all night on that one, Toby. Me and Leo and Josh. They were screaming  at me, “Governor, for God’s sakes, it’s got to be Toby. It’s got to be Toby.” When  I held my ground, and we went to David Rosen, and Rosen said he wanted to take a  partnership at Solomon Brothers, thank God... I couldn’t live without you Toby.  I mean it. I’d be in the tall grass. I’d be in the weeds... I know I disappoint you  sometimes. I mean I can sense your disappointment. And I only get mad because I know  you’re right a lot of the times, but you are not the kid in the class with his hand  up and whatever it was you said to C.J. You are a wise and brilliant man, Toby...  The other night when we were playing basketball, did you mean what you said? My  demons were shouting down the better angels in my brain?"
2545,bartlet,You think that’s what’s stopping me from greatness?
2547,bartlet,I suppose you’re right.
2548,toby,"Tell you what though, sir. In a battle between a President’s demons and his better  angels, for the first time in a long while, I think we might just have ourselves a  fair fight."
2549,bartlet,"Thank you, Toby.  Now, go away."
2552,josh,"Oh, thanks very much. I’m seeing a new barber."
2553,josh,Mind your own business.  What classes are you taking?
2555,josh,"Charlie, you met Zoey Bartlet?"
2556,josh,"Okay, hang on a second. Let’s take it back a moment and give it another chance.  This is a girl, Charlie. You don’t have to call her “ma’am.”"
2557,josh,That would be her father.
2561,c.j.,"I don’t know. I mean, maybe the vending machines fall on them while they’re getting  their change."
2563,c.j.,"She really was very sweet, Leo."
2564,bartlet,Josh! We’ve been looking for you.
2566,bartlet,"Look at this, will you?"
2568,bartlet,"I don’t know why, but nothing makes me feel quite so good as the sight of colleagues,  enjoying each other outside work."
2569,josh,"So, what were you guys talking about?"
2570,bartlet,We were talking about these women.
2576,josh,"Mr. President, there’s something that’s been bothering me for most of the day, and  while I know that this is an inappropriate time..."
2578,josh,"I serve at the pleasure of the President, and it’s a great privilege that I will  never forget.  I can’t keep this. I think  it’s a white flag of surrender. I want to be a comfort to my friends in tragedy.  And I want to be able to celebrate with them in triumph. And for all the times in  between, I just want to be able to look them in the eye. Leo, it’s not for me. I  want to be with my friends, my family, and these women."
2579,bartlet,"Uh, excuse me! Thank you. Uh, friends, please... Well, chili’s ready and I hope  you all enjoy it. In fact, since I told you you would enjoy it, I’m reasonably  certain that you will. "
2581,bartlet,"It’s an incredible adventure you’re starting on, sweetheart. An amazing four years  full of people and experiences you haven’t yet dreamed of. And if you will allow me  just one minute of business, please. I hope that by the time we’re done with our  four years here, we’ll have seen to it that every young person who chooses can go  to college and beyond, regardless of their economic status."
2582,c.j.,"Nine, no help. Jack, no help. Eight, possible flush. King, possible flush. Ace, no  help. Six, possible straight. Dave of love for the dealer. Ace bets."
2592,toby,"Mr. President, check or bet sir. Those are your choices."
2594,josh,Or you should feel free to give us a quiz on inane trivia.
2595,bartlet,There is one fruit whose seeds are on the outside. Name it please.
2604,toby,I see it. And I raise you five.
2608,toby,"Well, thank you sir. I just raised your bet."
2609,bartlet,"Yes you did Toby, and I thought it was a bold move when you consider that Leo’s  holding the six you’re looking for."
2610,toby,Do you call the raise sir?
2613,bartlet,There are fourteen punctuation marks in Standard English grammar. Can anyone name  them please?
2620,bartlet,That’s only seven. There are seven more.
2621,toby,"Question mark, exclamation point, quotation marks, brackets, parentheses, braces  and ellipses."
2624,toby,Do you call the raise sir?
2625,bartlet,"There are three words, and three words only in the English language that begin with  the letters DW."
2626,josh,This is a pretty good illustration of why we get nothing done.
2627,bartlet,Can anyone name them for me please?
2634,toby," C’mon Princeton. We’ve got dwindle, we’ve got dwarf. "
2635,bartlet,I see you five and raise you five by the way.
2640,bartlet,"“Witches brew a magic spell, in an enchanted forest where fairies...”"
2641,toby,"Dwell! Dwell, dwell! Dwindle, dwarf and dwell!"
2642,bartlet,"Well, the answer’s correct but let’s check with our judges and -- oh no, I’m sorry,  time’s expired."
2645,josh,You have your own time?
2648,toby,"Take your money sir. You’d dwell to report that to the I.R.S., report you as I will."
2652,josh,"Sam, I’m going back to the office, they’ve got the commerce report ready for me.  What are you doing?"
2654,josh,"Sam, I’m going back to the office, they’ve got the commerce report ready for me.  What are you doing?"
2658,bartlet,"Charlie, I’m headed over to the residence, you’re done for the night."
2659,bartlet,Don’t stay up too late son.
2662,josh,This is happening way too often.
2664,josh,This whole room is doors and windows.
2666,josh,I’m cooperating. I’m cooperating.
2667,bartlet,All right.  What body of water in South America is formed by the  confluence...?
2668,toby,Excuse me Wink Martindale? Do you really think this is the time?
2669,bartlet,Not quite up on your South American geography are you my friend?
2671,toby,"Cathy, I need a copy of Article 1, Section 2."
2673,toby,Does anybody have a copy of the Constitution?  This is discouraging.
2674,toby,Oh for crying out loud! Try Amazon.COM. If they don’t have it then just bust into  the glass display case at the National Archives!
2676,toby,"Is it still in print, is what my staff would like to know."
2679,c.j.,"It’s not a big deal, I’m just, you know, here to see him about something."
2681,c.j.,Absolutely no reason that you should.
2684,c.j.,Hey. That was all great... what you just said there. 
2686,c.j.,"Not so much what you said, but the way you said it. "
2704,c.j.,"Sam, I read my briefing book last night on the commerce bill regarding the census  and there are certain parts of it I don’t understand."
2710,c.j.,I don’t understand certain nuances.
2718,c.j.,"I’ve been playing it fast and loose there’s no doubt about it, but sitting in on  some of the meetings we’ve been having, and reading the briefing book last night,  I have to say that the census is starting to sound to me like it’s, well, important."
2720,c.j.,"And, I’ve come to the realization that if I’m gonna be talking about it all week,  it’s probably best that I understand what I’m saying."
2732,c.j.,I know. I probably shouldn’t do that.
2742,josh,It’ll actually shake out to about 32 billion.
2744,josh,"Well, you know what they say?"
2746,josh,"A billion dollars here, a billion dollars there. Sooner or later it starts to add  up to real money."
2748,josh,I didn’t coin it or anything.
2756,josh,‘Cause we’re Democrats.
2758,josh,Sure it is. It’s right there in our bank account. 
2767,toby,"550,000 dollars for New York State to restore the home of Susan B. Anthony."
2768,josh,"While we’re at it, the tile in my shower could use re-grouting."
2769,toby,"Power zones, US rail, and Federal funding for 100,000 new public school teachers."
2774,toby,Janice Willis’ husband.
2776,toby,Presumably he’s gonna do what he’s told.
2778,toby,Tomorrow’s the start of a three-day weekend and 435 congressmen want to make their  flights home in the morning.
2780,toby,"Oh, I know that’ll do it."
2784,josh,Leo. Knute Rockne. Sometimes I get them mixed up. 
2786,bartlet,What tripped the alarm?
2788,bartlet,It wasn’t a fraternity stunt?
2789,bartlet,"Well, you know, just trying to kill me isn’t necessarily evidence of being mentally  unbalanced!"
2795,bartlet,You know Ron Butterfield?
2797,bartlet,He says it was a woman!
2800,bartlet,Of course.  This woman was after Zoey?
2802,bartlet,There’s no need for Zoey to know about this right? 
2806,bartlet,Hang on a second. What’ve you got Ron?
2807,bartlet,"Well, I guess that’s something."
2814,bartlet, I guess we’re done too.
2823,josh,"We sure will, congressman."
2824,toby,"Morning. Everyone got fruit. Everyone got bagels. Good, good. Christopher, Anthony,  would you mind putting my copy of the Appropriations Bill on the table please.  Thank you Christopher, thank you Anthony, and thank you Cathy. Gentlemen, why don’t  we take our seats? Congressman Skinner, welcome. Congressman Gladman, always good  to have you here, sir. Congressman Willis, I was a great fan of your late wife."
2825,toby,"This represents the latest draft of the House Appropriations Bill. It is 7,000 pages  long, and weighs over 55 pounds. It includes 1.2 million dollars for a lettuce  geneticist in Salinas, California and 1.7 million dollars for manure handling in  Starkville, Mississippi."
2826,toby,Eight states will divide 5 million dollars to research the uses of wood.
2827,toby,I’m thinking of some uses for it right now.
2828,josh,We are. The White House just wanted to take this opportunity to point out that you’re  criminals and despots.
2830,josh,"No, sadly it won’t. What will stop the President from signing the bill is the amendment  your committee is offering on the census."
2831,toby,"I would like to emphasize the long floor fight of it all, and remind you that I have  absolutely no conscience when it comes to exploiting the fact that you have non- refundable airline tickets for the weekend. With that in mind..."
2834,toby," Good, then. Let’s talk."
2835,c.j.,And you’re gonna go slowly right?
2837,c.j.,Pretend for the purposes of this conversation that I’m dumb.
2839,c.j.,You’re cracking wise. I’m coming to you exposed and vulnerable.
2843,c.j.,"I’m a person saying there’s something I do not know, will you teach me. It’s hard  to admit you don’t know something. That makes me submissive."
2845,c.j.,I’m admitting to you that there are things I do not know.
2851,c.j.,"Can I just say that if the briefing book had been written that clearly, I would have  easily understood?"
2855,c.j.,"You are a very good teacher, Sam. I want you to know that in this..."
2866,josh,Did he say what it was about?
2868,josh,You won’t spend it right.
2870,josh,"Let’s say your cut of the surplus is $700. I want to take your money, combine it  with everyone else’s money and use it to pay down the debt and further endow social  security. What do you want to do with it?"
2874,josh,"The problem is, the DVD player you buy might be made in Japan."
2880,josh,You shouldn’t have voted for us.
2882,josh,"Mrs. Landingham, I got a message he needed to see me? "
2883,bartlet, I’m on a conference call with the  postmaster general.
2885,bartlet,I honestly couldn’t tell you.
2887,bartlet,"Look, I want you to do me a favor."
2889,bartlet,Take Charlie out for a beer tonight.
2890,josh,Take him out for a beer?
2891,bartlet,"Yeah. The kid has no life. You’re the only guy around here he knows at all. Take him  out for a couple of beers, you guys come back, we’ll all watch the vote in Leo’s office."
2893,bartlet,"Good, thanks. Let me give you some cash."
2896,josh,I have money Mr. President. I’m fine.
2899,bartlet,"Truth be known, I don’t have any cash on me."
2901,bartlet,I don’t carry cash anymore. I don’t carry keys either.
2902,josh,"Well, I wouldn’t think you’d need them sir."
2903,bartlet,How’s it going in there?
2908,josh,You don’t have to sit with your sister?
2910,josh,Tonight. We’ll go to a bar in Georgetown. We’ll speak as men do.
2914,josh,"I’m a Fulbright scholar Mrs. Landingham. I don’t leer. Also, there’ll be plenty of  grad students there."
2919,josh,How do you know I’m going out with Charlie?
2920,josh,The man is like a camp counselor.
2922,josh,These are plans among men.
2923,josh,"There’s gonna be grad students there, can we keep that in mind?"
2925,josh,Sam’s got enough going on in his life right now without you making a booty call.
2927,josh,"The President’s daughter, Chief of Staff’s daughter, a Georgetown bar and Sam.  What could possibly go wrong? "
2928,c.j.,What’s the problem with a straight head count?
2932,c.j.,And what’s the legal argument?
2934,c.j.,"But if sampling’s really against the law, why would congress be trying to pass  legislation saying sampling’s against the law?"
2936,c.j.,And you see I’m able to do it without being patronizing?
2941,josh,I’m taking Charlie for a beer tonight before the vote. Zoey and Mallory are coming.
2944,josh,If you want to come... I guess that’d be okay.
2945,c.j.,"Why, Josh, you’ve swept me off my feet."
2946,josh,Whatever. I’ll see you later. 
2947,toby,Sampling will give a count that bears a much greater relationship to reality and  will do it to the tune of 4 billion dollars less than a door-to-door head count.
2948,toby,"Every single expert, including the census bureau itself, which is a bipartisan  commission, has said sampling is better. "
2952,toby,Let’s take a look at it.
2953,toby,Let’s take a look at it!
2954,toby,My staff managed to unearth a copy.
2955,toby,"Mandy, would you read please from Article 1 Section 2?"
2956,toby,"Still, in all it is the owner’s manual and we should read what it has to say!"
2957,toby,Actually that’s not what it says.
2958,toby,Mandy left out a few words. Didn’t she Mr. Willis? 
2959,toby,"Mr. Willis teaches 8th grade social studies, and Mr. Willis knows very well what the  article says. It says which shall be determined by adding the whole number of free  persons. And three fifths of all other persons. Three fifths of all other persons.  They meant you Mr. Willis. Didn’t they?"
2960,toby,"Mr. Willis, you are asking to enact a law, which will limit the ability of those  people who need to be counted the most, to be counted as people at all. And they’re  only refuge is the argument that Article 1, Section 2 is not arcane."
2961,toby,"Congressman, you are talking about tying up an Appropriations Bill-"
2963,toby,Absolutely sir. It is your choice.
2964,toby,It got through whatever door was open to me.
2965,toby,Thank you gentlemen. Have a good weekend.
2968,toby,"If you don’t mind me asking sir, what changed your mind?"
2969,toby,"Well, I know it wasn’t expediency sir. I was wondering what changed your mind?"
2970,toby,"Well thank you.  I’m smiling because, well, around here the merits of a  particular argument generally take a back seat to political tactics."
2972,toby,I was taking advantage of you sir.
2973,toby,"There are some things I did not mention. First of all, it is partisan. Second of all,  I’m not wild about the precedent. "
2974,toby,"What’s to stop us from saying we don’t need elections, we’ll just use polling data.  1150 people with the sampling error of plus or minus three will decide who runs the  country."
2976,toby,I’m sorry I never got to know your wife sir.
2978,toby,"Nothing to it. They call your name, you vote yea. "
2979,toby,Well good luck congressman.
2983,bartlet,"I’ll take the call wherever I am when he calls, I guess."
2984,bartlet,I’m not adopting a tone. I’m just trying to get out of here.
2985,bartlet,I’m saying no. I just want to go home.
2987,bartlet,Goodnight Mrs. Landingham.  I heard it’s done?
2989,bartlet,Good. I’m headed over to the residence.
2995,bartlet,"Leo, you’re kidding me?!"
2999,bartlet,"Don’t tell me nothing happened, Leo. I know you. I know Jenny. Married couples  like you don’t just get divorced. Not cause nothing happened!"
3001,bartlet,I want to talk to Jenny.
3003,bartlet,I don’t understand how this happened Leo. You and Jenny were happy!
3005,bartlet,Because you weren’t spending enough time with her? 
3007,bartlet,Marriage needs attention Leo. It can’t run on autopilot. Come on. It’s not your  prom date we’re talking about here. We’re talking about your family!
3009,bartlet,You can’t blame this on me.
3013,bartlet,And you’re just now telling me?
3017,bartlet,It IS as simple as that. You’re the man. Fix it. 
3026,josh, His special friend that Zoey can’t know about. 
3028,c.j.,How does Mallory know about that?
3030,c.j.,You told our boss’ daughter that you slept with a call girl?
3032,josh,So you thought you were telling a complete stranger that you slept with a call girl?
3037,c.j.,She didn’t bring my grasshopper.
3040,josh,Maybe she just felt really stupid ordering it.
3041,c.j.,The grasshopper is a perfectly respectable...
3046,josh,Make sure they make it extra thick and green.
3047,c.j.,The President is a very protective father.
3048,josh," So, you having a good time tonight?"
3049,josh,Seems like you’re not really having a good time.
3050,c.j.,He’s having a good time!
3052,c.j.,"Charlie, you’re twice as smart as anyone in the room. "
3054,c.j.,"See, you keep telling him to relax with this sense of urgency..."
3055,josh,I just want to make sure he’s having a good time tonight.
3056,c.j.,He’s having a good time! You relax!
3058,josh,"I wouldn’t say that there was urgency in my voice. I was simply asking if he was  having a good time, and suggesting that if he relaxed..."
3059,c.j.,"Well, maybe if you stopped pestering him like you were his great Aunt Ida..."
3060,c.j.,Do you see what I’m saying?
3061,josh,Why must you mock a perfectly natural brotherly instinct...?
3062,c.j.,"I’m not mocking it Josh, I’m saying maybe if you left the young man alone..."
3068,josh, How’s everybody doin’?
3070,josh,"Oh, this is too good to be true."
3071,josh,"Yeah. You guys don’t realize it, but you’re having a pretty bad night."
3072,josh," Well, my work here is done."
3074,bartlet,Did you do anything at all to provoke these guys? 
3075,bartlet,Were you flirting with them?
3076,bartlet,"Zoey, you flirt with guys."
3077,bartlet,So what were you doing?
3078,bartlet,What the hell were you doing drinking?
3079,bartlet,I’m gonna up your protection.
3082,bartlet,Well you’ll have plenty of friends to walk you to class.
3084,bartlet,You’re getting this part of your life.
3086,bartlet,"Look, the Secret Service..."
3087,bartlet,"They are worried about me getting shot. I’m worried about me getting shot. But that  is nothing compared to how terrified we are of you. You scare the hell out of the  Secret Service Zoey, and you scare the hell out of me too. My getting killed would  be bad enough, but that is not the nightmare scenario. The nightmare scenario,  sweetheart, is YOU getting kidnapped. You go out to a bar or a party in some club,  and you get up to go to the restroom, somebody comes up from behind, puts their  hand across your mouth, and whisks you out the back door. You’re so petrified, you  don’t even notice the bodies of two secret service agents lying on the ground with  bullet holes in their heads. Then you’re whisked away in a car. It’s a big party  with lots of noise, and lots of people coming and going. And It’s a half hour  before someone says, “Hey where’s Zoey?” Another 15 minutes before the first phone  call. Another hour and a half before anyone even THINKS to shut down all the  airports. Now we’re off to the races. You’re tied to a chair in a cargo shack,  somewhere in the middle of Uganda. And I’m told that I have 72 hours to get Israel  to free 460 terrorist prisoners. So I’m on the phone pleading with Benjamin and  he’s saying, “I’m sorry Mr. President, but Israel simply does not negotiate with  terrorists, period. It’s the only way we can survive.” So now we’ve got a new  problem, because this country no longer has a commander in chief, it has a father  who’s out of his mind because his little girl is in a shack somewhere in Uganda  with a gun to her head. DO YOU GET IT?!"
3088,bartlet," I’m sorry I yelled sweetheart. Forgive me. Honey, I want you to have  your freedom and your youth. I want you to have common everyday experiences with  girls your own age. But don’t ever forget - this is a privilege, and it is an  experience that must be cherished beyond measure. And proper protection and  security, though at times I admit, it’s a drag, is never too high a price to pay."
3089,bartlet,It’s alright sweetheart. It’s alright.
3090,bartlet,"Goodnight, sweetheart. I love you."
3093,bartlet,"Hi. Before, when I was being an idiot, there was something I forgot to say."
3097,bartlet,I would like unanimous consent to revise and extend my remarks.
3099,bartlet,"I don’t know what the hell was the matter with me, Leo. If there’s anything I can  do to help, anything?"
3101,josh,"Let me tell you something, I could have taken the two guys on the left."
3105,josh,The guys on the left as you’re facing the bar?
3109,josh,"Thank you, Donna. Defending virtue is hungry work."
3113,josh,How much were the sandwiches?
3117,josh,That was nice. That was a little parable.
3120,josh,"Okay, there’s the one guy with the blonde hair?"
3124,bartlet,What were you doing taking my daughter out to a bar? 
3126,bartlet,I told you to take Charlie. When Zoey said she was going I just assumed you were  gonna go have malteds or something.
3129,josh,What is this? 'Our Town'?
3130,bartlet,Well anyway. Thank you for doing whatever it was you did.
3131,josh,"As a matter of fact, I didn’t do anything. But for what it’s worth I should tell  you that Charlie didn’t blink before he put his body between danger and Zoey."
3132,bartlet," Charlie? Sam, you come too please."
3133,bartlet," You know, I once played the stage manager in a production of Our Town."
3134,bartlet,"Charlie, you a good poker player?"
3135,bartlet,"Excellent, get your money out and take a seat."
3136,c.j., Is Josh being punished?
3141,bartlet,Good work both of you. You bought us some time.
3142,toby,I understand you all had a very interesting evening. 
3148,toby,He didn’t walk into the room with a political agenda. He didn’t walk in with his  mind made up. He genuinely wanted to do what he thought was best. He didn’t mind  saying the words I don’t know.
3149,c.j.,"I said I don’t know to Sam just this morning and I’d like to say I’m a better person  for it. By the way, I now know everything there is to know about the census. Go ahead, you can ask me anything."
3150,bartlet,How many people live in the United States?
3152,josh,"Come on, Toby. Sit down."
3153,toby,I just want to watch this.
3155,toby,I just want to hear this one.
3156,c.j.,The first lady will be wearing a Badgely Mischka silk Shantung gown with a beaded bodice.
3157,c.j.,"I believe she will be wearing shoes, yes."
3158,c.j.,Black suede and velvet with a Manolo Blahnik slides with a rhinestone and mother of  pearl toe buckle.
3159,c.j.,Gabriel Sanchez freshwater pearl necklace with tourmaline beads. I’m also told to inform  you she will be carrying a Christina Bomba silk pleated organdy drawstring evening bag. 
3160,c.j.,Mrs. Siguto will be wearing a traditional silk kegaya in dark purple with an overlay of  black silk lace. 
3161,c.j.,"Matching open-toe evening slippers. Her jewelry is by an artist from her birthplace,  which is Jakarta."
3162,c.j.,It is fashioned with rubies and gold. Anything else? 
3163,c.j.,"Man alive, do I love it when In Style magazine is issued press credentials. Mirabella  needed to know what kind of wine is being served with the fish course. So, it’s a good  thing I went to school for 22 years. "
3165,c.j.,It’s wine and you’ll drink it.
3168,josh,Sarah is picking up speed and power and has now been classified as a class four system.  You might want to talk about preparations and contingencies.
3169,c.j.,Sure. What are we talking about?
3174,josh,Georgia and parts of the Carolinas. 
3176,josh,It will hit landfall by tonight. 
3178,josh,Have you ever been in a hurricane?
3180,josh,"Me neither, but they look pretty serious."
3186,c.j.,How long is it going to last?
3188,c.j.,There’s a state dinner tonight.
3192,c.j.," Hey, did you know about the hurricane?"
3195,toby,"Listen, I want you to start preparing for something. There’s a situation in McClane."
3199,toby,"There’s a property there that local law enforcements had surrounded for four days.  A farmhouse, with anywhere from 18 to 40 Survivalists."
3204,toby,"The F.B.I. decided it’s a hostage situation. So, we have ourselves a whole new ball game."
3205,c.j.,"So, let me see if I have this.  And the government’s planning a siege on 18 to 40 of its citizens,  all the while we host a state dinner for the President of Indonesia."
3207,c.j.,"Amazingly, you know what I’ll get asked most often today? "
3210,c.j.,Black suede and velvet. Manolo Blahnik slides with a rhinestone and mother of pearl  toe buckle.
3212,josh,"Low-pressure system. It’s another low-pressure system. Okay, I’m talking to the Red  Cross. I’ll call you in about an hour... Yeah. Bye."
3215,josh,"A senior Indonesian deputy is coming tonight. Toby and I want to talk to him alone  for a few minutes. I need you to find out if he can speak English and if he can’t,  we need to get an interpreter from State."
3217,josh,Ramahedi Sumahedjo Bambang.
3227,josh,I wish you wouldn’t do that.
3229,josh,Because you tend to call some bizarre factoid from a less than reputable source and  then you blow it all out of proportion.
3235,josh,They... summarily execute people they suspect of being sorcerers?
3241,josh,"Well, thanks for the head’s up."
3245,josh,It’s a class 4 hurricane. FEMA’s down in Georgia with the Red Cross. The President  should be prepared to sign some sort of federal disaster relief. What’s going on with  the truckers?
3247,josh,C.J.’s going to need to know what they’re wearing.
3252,c.j.,"But, they’re part time employees."
3254,toby,A younger workforce puts a premium on job flexibility and they’re unwilling to make a  long time commitments to a single company. What do you expect?
3262,josh,I’ll assign someone from my office.
3264,josh,"Because, you’re a political consultant and... this is an actual... you know... thing."
3265,josh,"I don’t think it will be the end of this administration, Leo. I think it will be the  end of this republic."
3267,josh, The... uh... Redskins suck.
3271,toby,Did Josh talk to you about the...?
3280,c.j.,"No questions right now, Harry."
3281,bartlet,"She’s not worried about the length of your question, she’s worried about the length  of my response."
3282,bartlet,We’re having salmon tonight. 
3284,bartlet,Yo-yo Ma is going to play.  Do you like salmon?
3286,toby,What do you have so far?
3288,toby,The beginnings of a real democracy.  Let’s not get carried away. 
3290,toby,Don’t... Don’t say friends. 
3292,toby,Fine. But I don’t think we should remind people how friendly we were with dictators  who oppressed their people while stealing their money.
3294,toby,"See, that’s good. Write that in the toast? "
3298,toby,We got to see a guy about a thing.
3306,josh,Why aren’t you in your own office?
3307,josh,There’s a reason for that.
3308,josh,Did they... refuse it politely?
3309,josh,Yes... that’s what I’m asking you. 
3310,josh,"Yes, but you shouldn’t take it personally. It bugs me when the President listens to  anyone who isn’t me."
3312,josh,You know that for sure?
3313,josh,"Yeah, I was wondering why that was. "
3316,bartlet,She’d like you to say a little more on the subject. 
3318,c.j.,One more question. Danny?
3320,bartlet,"I try not to look out my window that much, Danny. What protestors? "
3322,c.j.,"Danny, I’m going to cover vermeil at the briefing, that’s all folks, I got to bring  in the next group."
3326,c.j.,I happen to know what vermeil is. 
3327,c.j.,"My one o’clock briefing is going to be about the vermeil protestors, isn’t it?"
3329,c.j.,I need to know what vermeil is and why people are protesting it. 
3336,bartlet,"I can’t decide if that man is boring or rude, but he’s one or the other. "
3338,bartlet,"I’m sitting out there trying to figure out how this guy campaign for something  and win, then I remembered--we usually rig the elections. "
3340,bartlet,You think it’s important he sit at my table tonight? 
3346,bartlet,"Ah, that’s the fun table. "
3350,bartlet,Because of the hurricane?
3354,bartlet,Sorry to keep you waiting.  Did I mention we’re having salmon tonight?
3361,toby,"Absolutely, otherwise it’s just a waste of food. "
3363,toby,We’re not telling them how to run their lives. 
3369,toby,Well... that was just about the worst writing I have ever heard.
3371,c.j.,Vermeil is gilded silver. Silver covered in gold. The White House has one of the  largest collections in the world. 
3372,c.j.,"Well, these are 18th and 19th century French objects. Many designed by the noted  European silversmith, Jean-Baptiste Claude Odiot."
3373,c.j.,The collection is kept in the Gold Room along with the ten-arm glass cut chandelier  which was made in England in 1785. 
3374,c.j.,Nothing at all. It’s just interesting information and I thought I’d share it with you.
3375,c.j.,"Many workers were blinded by the mercury while making these pieces. Louis the 15th  would melt them down to pay for his wars against his people. So, in general, they’re  seen in some circles as a symbol of a government’s bloody and tyrannical oppression  of its own people. We use them as centerpieces with a seasonal floral arrangement."
3376,c.j.," I’ll be honest with you, Tom. I haven’t run this by the President  yet, but I’ll have that for you, plus the rest of the day’s scores and highlights at the  next briefing at 4:00 or 5:00. Thank you. "
3377,c.j.,I won’t need a transcript of that.
3378,c.j.,"You’re a rabble rouser, you know that? You rouse rabbles."
3379,c.j.,I went and looked at your big vermeil demonstration. Six people in Lafayette Park  with oak tag and magic markers. 
3380,c.j.,Six people! Six pathetic people protesting on a Friday and you just lent their weak  and feeble voices a megaphone. What do you call that?
3381,c.j.,You’re very proud of yourself. 
3382,c.j.,What am I wearing tonight?
3383,c.j.,Your paper wants to know what I’m wearing?
3384,c.j., You want to know what I’m wearing?
3385,c.j., Well... I’m wearing... an evening gown of... gray silk.
3386,c.j.,"Well, okay. I got to go deal with the vermeil crazies. "
3411,josh,"Excuse me, Mr. President. These people aren’t thumbing through Hustler. They’re armed.  They’re evading arrest and they’re holding hostages."
3412,bartlet,You want to raid this house?
3414,josh,There’s no way this’ll end good. All that’s left is to end it fast.
3416,josh,"This is a stand off with federal officers. A peaceful settlement is “put your guns down,  you’re under arrest.”"
3417,bartlet,"All right, Mandy. Thank you. Josh? Would you two give us a minute, please?"
3418,josh,I don’t think it’s unreasonably macho for the White House to be aggressive in preserving  democracy.
3419,josh,"This isn’t abstract, Mandy. This isn’t a theoretical problem. The FBI says come out with  your hands up, you come out with your hands up. At which point, you’re free to avail  yourself of the entire justice system."
3421,josh,"Well, you’re in the game now."
3423,josh,"Well, prudent or not, once the scythe comes out, I’m probably going to haul ass."
3428,josh,"Don’t worry about it. Donna, call FEMA, use my name. When that doesn’t work, use Leo’s name. "
3430,josh,"I look good tonight, don’t you think? "
3431,josh,"You look good too, but I look even better."
3434,josh,I don’t have any thoughts on it one-way or the other.
3437,josh,It’s never really been made clear to me. 
3443,josh,He was once almost pushed out of an airplane by a CIA trained operator. 
3448,toby,Can I speak with you a moment?
3455,toby,This is Mr. Minaldi. The interpreter from State.
3456,josh,"You do speak Indonesian, don’t you?"
3459,josh,"It’s 7:30, is there anyone left at state?"
3461,josh,"Then, what are we doing?"
3463,toby,Where does that get us?
3465,toby,Wait a minute... ah... Why can’t the kitchen guy translate Batak into English?
3473,c.j.,Excuse me. Have you seen the First Lady?
3475,c.j.,"Good evening, Mrs. Bartlet."
3481,c.j.,"Thank you, Mrs. Bartlet. "
3484,c.j.,I appreciate the thought.
3486,c.j.,I spoke to Peggy about the vermeil. You might get a few questions.
3488,c.j.,"Yes, but it’s history. "
3490,c.j.,"Okay, well. Good answer."
3507,toby,Our reputations precede us.
3520,c.j.,It’s a whole new situation. 
3522,c.j.,"For some reason, there’s a fleet of ships out there."
3524,c.j.,Do you know about this?
3526,c.j.,They’re sitting right in the path of the hurricane.
3528,c.j.,"Leo, the thing is 600 miles across. They’re locked in. How bad can this get?"
3530,c.j.,What do you want to do?
3532,c.j.,I should start to work now.
3534,josh,"Yeah, okay... I appreciate your call. Thank you. "
3536,josh,"That was Chafey. They took the house. 34 occupants, they’re all in custody. "
3537,josh,They shot the FBI negotiator. He’s in critical condition.
3541,bartlet,The hurricane just shifted direction without any warning?
3544,bartlet,Captain? How big is this carrier group? How many men and how many ships?
3545,bartlet,How soon before the worst of it starts?
3546,bartlet,Is there any way I can speak with the fleet commander? 
3547,bartlet,All right. Let’s do it.
3549,bartlet,Any word on the FBI guy’s condition?
3554,toby,"Mr. Gomez, you speak Batak. Is that correct?"
3555,toby,"As you just did, you also speak Portuguese?"
3557,toby,"Okay. Those are two pretty tough languages, Batak and Portuguese... you might want to  take a crack at English one day, seeing as how you live here. Okay?"
3558,toby," Mr. Bambang, thank you for agreeing to meet with me today."
3560,josh,Sorry I’m late. I’m Josh Lyman.
3561,toby,This is going to take a while.
3562,josh,Are you enjoying the evening?
3563,toby,"Josh, this isn’t the best context for chit-chat. "
3564,josh,Mandy is pretty upset. I didn’t do a great job. 
3565,toby,He’s answering a question from like a half hour ago. Mr. Bambang? 
3572,toby,"Yes. Mr. Gomez, Mr. Minaldi, thank you for your trouble."
3573,toby, A friend of mine is in one of your jails. I want you to let him out. 
3575,toby,Because he’s my friend and the French don’t give a damn.
3576,josh,We’re not talking about the extradition process. 
3577,toby,"What we’re talking about is that you unlock the cell, you put him in a car, and you  drive him to the border."
3578,toby,That’s what he does. He teaches students how to protest. 
3581,toby," Please understand that with so many people watching... with so much media coverage...  it was important for us to make clear that the United States, with it’s commitment to  human rights..."
3583,josh,We’ll talk to the French.  Toby. We’ll  talk to the French.
3585,c.j.,You’re not supposed to be back here right now.
3586,c.j.,We’ll have a statement in 15 minutes.
3587,c.j.," Danny, did you hear me say we’ll have a statement in  15 minutes? God, Danny."
3588,c.j.,"When you flirt with me, are you doing it to get a story?"
3593,c.j.,You know what? You’re the one who goes around town saying that I’m too friendly with  the press corps and that makes me a weak press secretary.
3594,c.j.,"Yeah, but you’ve been thinking it."
3597,c.j.,You really like the dress?
3603,bartlet,Talk to me for five minutes apiece and then we’re going to settle this. 
3638,bartlet,"Yes, I know. But I got tired of listening to you. Now you listen to me. I have a Nobel Prize  in Economics and I’m here to tell you that none of you know what the hell you’re talking  about. At 12:01 am, I’m using my executive power to nationalize the trucking industry."
3639,bartlet,Fourteen White House lawyers disagree. Truman did it in ‘52 with the coalmine.
3640,bartlet,"In 50 years, there’s a new bench and I’ll take my chances. As for Labor, I am calling  Congress into Emergency Session to grant me the authority to draft the truckers into  military service. You’re going to love our food. Nice talking to you folks. If this  isn’t settled in 47 minutes, don’t worry. We know where to find you. "
3644,bartlet,I approved a plan for an FBI negotiator.
3648,bartlet,"What the hell? Well, if this isn’t a metaphor for powerlessness, I don’t know what is.  We better get back to work, huh?"
3650,bartlet,We got the fleet commander?
3652,bartlet,"So, I guess I’m going to talk to the Captain of the Hickory?"
3653,josh,"The intercom’s been knocked out. They’re looking for him on foot, sir."
3654,bartlet,Is there somebody on there now? 
3658,bartlet,Hello?  Hello? Anyone there?
3659,bartlet,"Hickory, this is the White House. Who am I speaking to?"
3660,bartlet,Son? This is President Bartlet.  Hello?
3662,bartlet,Can I talk to you in the meantime?  Hello?
3663,bartlet,"Are you all right, Harold?"
3665,bartlet,Can you put something on it?
3666,bartlet,You go over and get it. I’ll stay right here.
3667,bartlet,"Harold?  Harold, are you back?"
3668,bartlet,Can you tell us what’s going on?
3671,bartlet,Can you tell us what’s going on?
3672,bartlet,"Well, I don’t know, man. Sounds pretty bad, Harold. I think I’m going to ask for my  money back.  Harold?"
3673,bartlet,"I’m going to stay right here, as long as the radio works, okay?"
3675,bartlet,"Yellowstone, established by an act signed by Ulysses S. Grant was the nation’s first  national park - March 1, 1872."
3676,josh," It’s getting late, sir. I was wondering, are we through for the evening?"
3677,bartlet," Well, we’re through with work, Josh, but this part’s fun."
3679,bartlet,"The part where I get you to sit down, and teach you a little something."
3684,josh,"Perhaps, if you get into bed and..."
3685,bartlet,"I’m a national park buff, Josh."
3687,bartlet, I said I’m a national park buff. I bet you didn’t know that about me.
3688,josh,"Well, I didn’t know that about you, sir, but I’m certainly not surprised."
3690,josh,"You’re... quite a nerd, Mr. President."
3693,bartlet,I assume that was said with all due respect.
3695,bartlet," Is it nerd-like to know that Everglades National Park  is the largest remaining subtropical wilderness in the continental United States,  AND has extensive mangrove forests?"
3696,josh,"Just a little bit. Yes, sir."
3697,bartlet,"There are 54 national parks in the country, Josh."
3698,josh,Please tell me you haven’t been to all of them.
3699,bartlet,I HAVE been to all of them. I should show you my slide collection.
3701,bartlet," Grand Canyon, Bryce Canyon, Badlands, Capitol Reef, Acadia,  which is so often overlooked..."
3702,josh,"You should certainly feel free to keep talking, but I need to go home so I could be back  in my office in four hours."
3704,josh,"See, the thing is, I can’t leave without your permission."
3705,bartlet,"Petrified Forests, North Cascades, Joshua Tree, Shenandoah National Park, right here  in Virginia! "
3706,josh,Good a place as any to dump your body.
3708,josh,Did I say that out loud?
3709,bartlet,"See, and I was gonna let you go home."
3711,bartlet,We’re gonna talk about Yosemite.
3739,c.j.,Till two in the morning?
3740,c.j.,They were talking till two in the morning?
3741,bartlet,We beat the Banking Lobby!
3746,c.j.,Were you and Josh talking ‘til two in the morning about national parks?
3747,bartlet,"Ooh, C.J., Everglades National Park is one of the biggest..."
3748,bartlet,Right. I got to take this call so I can gloat about the Banking Bill.
3750,bartlet,Be talking about this C.J. This is the story!
3754,bartlet," Oh, incidentally, the California Live Oak is the..."
3757,bartlet,"Twelfth round knockout, C.J.! "
3759,bartlet,"This is the saddest looking cabinet I have ever... look at this. I have an agriculture  secretary who hasn’t eaten a vegetable in his life. Everybody sit down. You’re freaking  me out. Good morning, Leo."
3760,bartlet,Hello. Are you taking minutes?
3762,bartlet,Mildred? I’m Josiah Bartlet. I’m the President of the United States. 
3764,bartlet,"Uh, would you skip down, please?"
3765,bartlet,"Actually, I find these meeting to be a fairly mind-numbing experience, but Leo assures  me that they are Constitutionally required, so let’s get it over with. Proceed, Mildred."
3767,bartlet,Our first goal should be finding a way to work with Congress?
3768,bartlet,You don’t think our first goal is should be finding a way to best serve the American People?
3769,bartlet,"Really? Let’s have a look.  Yeah, that’s what it says right here. Would you like Mildred to read it back again?"
3771,bartlet,Good. Now let’s get to work.
3778,toby,My writing’s been a little flat lately.
3780,toby,"Well, you did the best you could."
3782,toby,You reached your potential here.
3784,toby,I can do better than this.
3786,toby,"I’m saying you’re fine, and I’m flat."
3788,toby,We’re having difficulty locating our talent.
3789,josh,Are you hearing anything about the Banking Bill?
3791,josh,I don’t know. I’m hearing some stuff.
3794,toby,Yeah. I’m having lunch with Crane.
3797,josh,I shouldn’t be nervous?
3800,toby,"Alright... It couldn’t have gone far, right?"
3802,toby,Somewhere in this building... is our talent.
3805,c.j.,How is it my staff just lets you walk in here?
3806,c.j.,They’re supposed to like me.
3812,c.j.,No. Tell me more about this.
3819,c.j.,"No, you idiot, I mean, I can’t have dinner."
3822,c.j.,You heard anything about the cabinet meeting this morning?
3824,c.j.,Like the President took Hoynes out for a ride?
3852,c.j.,What’s your thing about?
3859,c.j.,Danny Concannon said that he heard that the President and Hoynes had a...
3863,c.j.,Then why is Danny asking me about it?
3865,c.j.,You think he’s gonna tell me?
3868,c.j.,What do you want me to do?
3870,c.j.,"You’re a real details man aren’t you, Leo?"
3900,c.j.,I’d just want to keep it from becoming a story.
3901,c.j.,"And I’d like to keep it that way, sir."
3902,c.j.,What happened at the cabinet meeting and how did Danny find out about it?
3907,toby,"Banking Bill’s gonna pass the house, let’s prepare a statement."
3909,toby,He said it was in the bag.
3913,toby,I just got done with Crane.
3914,josh,"Well, Crane’s two hours behind."
3923,josh,"Big Sky Federal Reserve, Sam. They want to strip mine the length and breadth of Montana."
3929,josh,"Please, this isn’t about the environment. It’s about retribution."
3932,josh,"Yeah, we need to see the President."
3935,c.j.,I am reluctant to characterize it other than to say the President is interested in what  the practical effects of the policy would be.
3938,c.j.," That’s being worked out, and I can go into more detail later."
3939,c.j.,"I could, but then you’d have no reason to talk to me later."
3940,c.j.,I’ll do that later this afternoon. Thank you everybody.
3941,c.j.,"Bonnie, find Toby for me, would you?"
3942,c.j.,"Danny, do you see that this is a restricted area? There are signs posted."
3943,c.j.,There are usually signs posted.
3945,c.j.,"First of all, you’re wrong. Second of all, shut up. Third, I went to Hoynes about your  thing and it wasn’t him who talked to you and I believe him, and now he’s really pissed  at me, and he’s right, and fourth... shut up again."
3946,c.j.,"Yes, well, I know that now."
3947,c.j.,"Say goodbye to Danny, everybody."
3949,c.j.,No I’d like to keep it a surprise.
3957,bartlet,Eaton and Broderick attached a land-use rider?
3959,bartlet,I’m surprised Eaton and Broderick had taken an interest in anything.
3963,bartlet,What did I do to them during the campaign?
3965,bartlet,They want to strip-mine Big Sky?
3969,josh,I knew you were gonna say that.
3973,bartlet,"Excuse me, fellas, over here please."
3976,josh,What Sam meant to say was that we can live without the environmental lobby.
3985,toby,Send a signal to the banking committee that we will not be held hostage by Eaton and Broderick.
3987,josh,I always knew the day would come when Sam would start selling off entire states. I was just  hoping he’d start with Delaware.
3989,toby,"Give me a few hours, sir. Let me talk to some people."
3992,bartlet,"I don’t like these people, Toby. I don’t want to lose."
3994,bartlet,All right. What’s next?
4001,bartlet,"Nah, I just came to see what you were doing."
4003,bartlet,"Nah, you know, we had most of the night blocked for that thing, and it got cancelled so..."
4007,bartlet, Nah. I still got 400 pages of nonsense to read.
4009,bartlet,I don’t like rattling around in that place with no one around but the butlers.
4013,bartlet,You had breakfast with Mal?
4019,bartlet,You ignored her mother.
4021,bartlet,"No, I’m saying that’s what it looks like to her right now."
4023,bartlet,"She doesn’t see what the job is, Leo. And anyone would have to see it to believe it.  And even if they saw it, even if they believed it, what would it matter? She’s her  mother’s daughter, and you made her mother cry."
4025,bartlet,"Well, I’m right next door all night."
4031,josh,Can you tell her I’m not in?
4037,josh,"I have no argument with that, but when they attach a rider that says they can strip-mine  half a..."
4038,josh," I don’t give a damn about Big Sky. I DO give a damn about hanging a sign outside  the White House that says, “Hey Republicans and Congress, feel free to slap us around  anytime you want just to show that you can.”"
4039,josh,"I don’t like Broderick and Eaton, but that’s not the point."
4041,josh,"Well, I’ll keep that in mind."
4062,toby,"The last thing you said was, “Are you listening to me?”"
4063,toby,"I’m not the one to talk to about the Banking Bill anymore, Mandy. I have hatred in my heart."
4064,toby,"You go ahead and pick them. Today, it’s Broderick and Eaton."
4070,c.j., Mandy wants you to recommend to the President that we do it her way.
4071,toby,Do you understand what she said?
4072,c.j.,"No, but she seemed pretty confident."
4073,toby,"Talk to anyone you want, but in this particular room, I need to work."
4075,c.j.,"Mandy, I wanted to ask you something."
4076,c.j.,"You know Danny Concannon pretty well, don’t you?"
4077,c.j.,"He’s sniffing around a story about the cabinet meeting this morning, which is not a  big deal, but I want him to back off."
4080,c.j.,"The President’s been messed with. He beat the banking lobby, and Broderick and Eaton  came back at the 11th hour and gave him a cheap clip in the knees. This is the kind of  thing Josh and Toby get geared up for. You’re not gonna talk them down."
4081,c.j.,"In our own defense, we actually do know that."
4084,bartlet,They had you write this?
4086,bartlet,You’re not a little overqualified for a birthday message?
4094,bartlet,"I mean as long as you’re on it, and you don’t mind, why don’t we take advantage of your  being on it and, you know, really do a job?"
4096,bartlet,It’s his fiftieth birthday. Let’s give it the Sam Seaborn quill. What do you think?
4098,bartlet,"Good. Take your time. Bring me back the next draft when it’s ready. I really appreciate  it, Sam."
4106,c.j.,May I discuss your story for a moment?
4108,c.j.,‘Cause I really have a hard time believing that one of the cabinet officers...
4112,c.j.,"The President would appreciate it if you wouldn’t pursue this story, and to show his  gratitude, he can give you thirty minutes on any subject or subjects that you like."
4142,josh,I don’t think it was Broderick and Eaton. I just... I don’t think they have the muscle.
4146,josh,"Honest to God, I think it was Crane."
4150,josh,"The guy who told you that it was gonna go through, no problem."
4152,josh,You’re not bothered by this?
4153,toby,"I wouldn’t say that. I’d say we’ve reached the end of the line, and I’m really not  interested in how we got there, and I’m ready to move on."
4157,toby,Let’s tell him to sign it.
4159,toby,"Round’s over, Josh. We did fine. "
4162,josh,"Yeah, but Crane and Broderick and Eaton?"
4164,josh,I’m still working on this.
4165,toby,The President’s gonna need to hear something.
4168,c.j.,"Good evening, Mrs. Landingham. Is he free for a moment?"
4172,c.j.,"Good evening, Mr. President. Am I disturbing you?"
4175,bartlet,"When are Josh and Toby gonna come up with a solution, huh?"
4176,c.j.,For the land-use rider?
4177,bartlet,"I want the banking bill, and I don’t want to give in."
4180,c.j.,Speaking of classic conundrums...
4181,bartlet,I don’t want to hear about Hoynes and the cabinet meeting.
4183,bartlet,Is Danny gonna make it a thing?
4185,bartlet,What did you have to give him?
4186,c.j.,A half hour sit-down on the record.
4188,c.j.,"Sir, the Vice President wasn’t the one who talked."
4192,c.j.,I’m pretty sure it was the woman taking minutes.
4219,bartlet,"Margaret!  Hey, you’re all dressed up."
4220,bartlet,"Yes, uh, could you bring me the chief of staff’s schedule for today, please?"
4221,bartlet,"Thank you.  You look a little glum, Mallory. Did you have plans to go  out this evening with someone who had to cancel due to circumstances beyond their control  because they have made a commitment to a common and higher purpose?"
4222,bartlet,"Oh, thank you Margaret.  How’d that go by the way?"
4224,bartlet,"Cool. He received a security briefing, a Central American briefing, and wrote a position  paper, and he’s been counseling me throughout the day of a bad decision I have to make.  Oh, and by the way, this was a very light day."
4225,bartlet,Uh... that’s a perfectly fair question.
4231,bartlet," Oh, my point is... give your dad a break. He’s your father."
4232,bartlet,Are you blowing me off?
4260,bartlet,Good. What can I do for you?
4261,bartlet,C.J. already talked to Danny Concannon. I think we’re fine.
4262,bartlet,"Well, that’s a different story."
4268,bartlet,"You shouldn’t have made me beg, John. I was asking you to be Vice President."
4269,bartlet,"Then don’t stand there and ask the question, John. It weakened me right out of the gate.  You shouldn’t have made me beg."
4272,josh,"Donna, who am I talking to about this?"
4276,josh,There’s a political cost of letting it go with the rider attached.
4278,josh," It’s not a win. Donna, will you tell Leo’s office that I’ll have  a solution for the President, very soon."
4280,josh,Does it look like I have a solution for the President?
4282,josh, Then let’s assume that I don’t.
4283,josh,"You can put a best face on a turnpike collision, Mandy. I’m not moved."
4287,josh,Okay. Where’s the Madison stuff?
4289,josh,"Donna, it’s twenty minutes. I need it faster."
4291,josh,"Yeah, you’re right.  Wait, what?"
4297,josh,Would you have them tell the President that I’m ready to see him in his convenience?
4304,toby,"Well, maybe you need a glass of wine."
4306,toby,Why don’t you let me try this?
4309,toby," Tell him to let me write this thing, will you?"
4315,toby,The President is empowered to designate any federal land to be a national park.
4320,toby,"No, I want to stay here."
4324,toby,It’s a birthday card for someone.
4328,toby,Let me try a crack at this.
4330,josh,You two need to put your heads down on your desk you know that?
4331,toby,Right away you’re starting off bad.
4332,bartlet,"Both black and grizzly bears inhabit Glacier Park, Charlie. And hikers are told to talk  or sing along the trail to keep them at bay."
4333,bartlet,It’s not as silly as it sounds.
4335,bartlet,"Yes, Glacier Park was the tenth. We have 44 to go."
4338,bartlet,"Have a good night, Charlie."
4340,josh,The antiquities act. You’re gonna establish Big Sky National Park.
4344,bartlet,"You understand it’s a bunch of rocks, right?"
4345,josh,I’m sure someone with your encyclopedic knowledge of the ridiculous and dork-like will  be able to find a tree or a ferret that the public has a right to visit.
4346,bartlet," More than a right, Josh."
4350,bartlet,You would enjoy nature.
4351,josh,"I’ve tried nature, sir. "
4354,bartlet,This is simplicity itself.
4359,josh,"Good night, Mr. President."
4361,bartlet, Thank you. Good night.
4364,josh,We talk about enemies more than we used to.
4366,josh,We talk about enemies more than we used to... I wanted to mention that.
4368,josh,"Good night, Mr. President."
4370,josh, Yes... Yes... Yes... So are you prepared at this point to...
4377,josh,I did it! C.J. was on the phone with her fingers crossed.
4378,c.j.,All you did was just one phone call.
4379,josh,"It was a series of phone calls, which I masterminded, while I’m not one to be selfish  about credit, I think it is important to know that it is done, and I DID IT! Donna, call  Toby. Call Sam. Call Leo. Call the president. Tell them I’m on my way over. "
4394,josh,I don’t know what you’re talking about.
4398,josh,"Because I didn’t, Donna. I’ve been on the phone for the last hour trying to seal the deal  to fill a seat on the Supreme Court."
4400,josh,You got to understand I’m talking about the United States Supreme Court right?
4407,toby,"Good morning, Mrs. Landingham."
4411,josh,"Well, that depends on your answer to this question, Mrs. Landingham: Who da man?"
4418,josh,He’s waiting for you sir.
4422,bartlet,This is huge. Which one of you is the man?
4423,toby,"On this one, we’d like to think of ourselves collectively as the men, sir."
4424,bartlet,"Mrs. Landingham, let’s make the phone call!"
4437,toby,"C.J. will let the press know that the president will introduce his nominee in an east room  press ceremony Thursday, 5 p.m."
4438,josh,"Can we do it on Friday, and give ourselves more time?"
4451,toby,"Josh, get me everything."
4452,josh,We vetted him two months.
4453,toby,"I’m gonna vet him four more days. I want to know every parking ticket. I want to know  every girlfriend he stood up for dinner in 1953. Mandy, you’re gonna roll this guy out  on a show that makes the queen’s coronation look like dinner theater. Sam, you’re gonna  write the president’s introduction. You’re also gonna write the Harrison’s remarks."
4455,toby,Show him the robe he gets. He’ll like it fine. 
4456,toby,"C.J., no leaks. If the name of this nominee is leaked out before I want it to be leaked  out, I’m gonna blame you, and you’re gonna find that unpleasant."
4457,c.j.,"I got to tell you something, Toby. You’re hot when you’re like this."
4458,toby, I am gonna put Harrison on the Court! I swear to God I am!
4459,josh,We meet again three hours.
4466,josh,Peyton Cabot Harrison III.
4468,josh,Peyton Cabot Harrison III. He sounds like he should be a Supreme Court justice.
4470,josh,"Phillips Exeter, Princeton, Rhodes scholar, Harvard Law Review, for which he was, oh yeah,  the editor. Did I mention that he was dean of Harvard Law School? Did I mention that his  father was attorney general to Eisenhower?"
4474,josh,"You’re not gonna ruin this moment for me, Donna."
4476,josh,This is a big day for us.
4478,josh,You know what we’re finally gonna have?
4480,josh,A smooth confirmation process.
4484,josh,"It’s gonna sail, Donna."
4486,josh,"Yes. Well, your fortune cookie wisdom notwithstanding, it’s gonna sail."
4488,josh,Why shouldn’t I get my hopes up?
4492,josh,Nothing bad is gonna happen this week.
4494,josh,"Look, there is no reason..."
4496,bartlet,"You’re too young to retire, Joseph."
4498,bartlet,He’s on the short list.
4500,bartlet,We’ll make our announcement on Thursday.
4501,bartlet,"I haven’t made a decision yet, Joseph."
4502,bartlet,Mendoza was on the short list.
4503,bartlet,"That’s not true, Joseph."
4507,c.j.,"Why, why, oh why do you ask me questions that you absolutely, positively know I’m not  gonna answer?"
4508,c.j.,"I can’t go out on a date with you, Danny."
4515,bartlet,I suppose we should get out there.
4516,bartlet,"I’m sorry Joseph, but I am..."
4517,bartlet,You’ve said quite a few words.
4519,bartlet,"Joseph, when the next seat opens up, I promise you..."
4520,bartlet,"In three years, I would hope to be running for reel..."
4521,bartlet,"That’s a little pessimistic, Joseph."
4522,bartlet,"You know I imagine the view from your largely unscrutinized place in history must be very  different from mine. But I remind you sir, that I have the following things to negotiate:  an opposition Congress, special interests with power beyond belief, and a bitchy media."
4523,bartlet,"Well, I am not Harry Truman."
4524,bartlet," It’s “Dr. Bartlet,” your honor. Now, let’s go start your retirement."
4527,c.j.,The president and Justice Crouch are old friends.
4528,c.j.,The man’s retiring today. It’s a courtesy call. What do you want from me?
4533,c.j.,"You’re killing me. You know that, Danny. "
4534,josh,That was inches from my head.
4538,josh,"It was inches. A little bit this way, a little bit that way, bam! Massive head wound."
4540,josh,"Yeah, but there for the grace of God, you know what I’m saying?"
4542,josh,I really think if big chunks of ceiling are gonna fall on anyone... I don’t know...
4546,josh,"From now on, before I come in in the morning, I want you to test my office."
4552,josh,He’s always unhappy about something.  Donna! Where’s my east Asia memo?!
4553,josh,What starts in two minutes?
4554,josh," It’s okay, Donna. I’ll just come and get it myself!"
4556,josh,We’re not gonna have any surprises today.
4557,josh,You’re not gonna get upstaged.
4561,josh,You should be nice to me. I could be dead you know.
4564,toby,"I would like you to play out that as a lifelong Democrat, he clerked for a Republican.  I would like you to play DOWN that he’d never written a judicial opinion on abortion or  revealed his thinking on Roe."
4568,toby,Lillienfield’s talking about something that’s bothering him today.
4580,c.j.,"Out of the clear blue sky, but that doesn’t matter."
4584,c.j.,"At some point, you hit your head in the ceiling, don’t you?"
4587,josh,"Five White House staffers in the room. I would like to say to the 1.6 of you who are  stoned right now, that it’s time to share."
4588,josh,"Mandy, if you can’t laugh at this, then you’re just not having enough fun in show business."
4589,josh,"He’s a featherweight, Mandy. He’s a hairdo."
4595,toby,There’s no way you saw this coming?
4597,toby,"Leo, I know I’m in your office. Forgive me.  But nobody saw this coming?!"
4598,c.j.,"Yeah. I can’t believe my psychic didn’t tell me, Toby. Rest assured, I’m gonna get  my twenty bucks back."
4601,c.j.,I can’t go with nothing.
4603,c.j.,Pretend we didn’t see it?
4604,josh,He’s a liar. He’s a fool. Categorically deny it and move on.
4607,c.j.,"Because more than 1300 people work for the White House, Josh. I go to the Press Room  and categorically deny that anyone uses drugs, and it turns out that three guys in the  photo lab blew a joint over the weekend, which is not like out of the realm of possibility.  And my next question is..."
4608,c.j.,"Yes. Well, I categorically deny that there are any more than three."
4610,c.j.,"Yes, and I understand she’s selling her story to Random House for a middle six-figure advance."
4611,toby, All right. Are we done with Masterpiece Theater?
4615,josh,"I don’t care if we say that, but... we’re not actually looking into it, are we?"
4620,toby,"C.J., go do your briefing. The president paid a courtesy call on Crouch this morning.  We got some exciting names. On the short list is Ed Harrison. We’ll introduce the nominee  Thursday, 5 o’clock. This business with Lillienfield..."
4621,c.j.,"I’ve heard about it, and I’d like the chance to see it first before I comment."
4622,toby,Is the president aware?
4623,c.j.,"We’d like to keep this things off the president’s desk until we measure what, if any,  credibility..."
4625,toby,We’re not gonna postpone.
4629,toby,"Go back to work, Mandy."
4630,josh,"Now, hang on a second. I’d like to hear what-"
4632,josh,We are not taking drug tests.
4635,toby,"Shut up.  Sam, go back to doing what you’re doing."
4639,toby,What do we know? What do they know?
4640,josh,"Now, wait, hang on a second. "
4642,josh,You’re not making me--I’m not gonna be the internal affairs cop around here.
4644,josh,"You want to know who’s doing what around here, you ask them yourself!"
4645,toby,"This isn’t the time, Josh. We taking water over the side..."
4646,josh,"Yes, and I’m not indifferent to that, but there’s a principle here-"
4647,toby,"No, there’s not. Not this week. We’ve been doing this for a year, and all we’ve gotten is  a year older. Our job approval’s 48%, and I think that number’s soft, and I’m tired of  being the field captain for the gang that couldn’t shoot straight! We’re getting this done!  What do we know? What do they know? Start with me, if you want."
4649,bartlet,A quick confirmation’s gonna be good for us.
4653,bartlet,Just what the doctor ordered.  Thank you.
4654,bartlet,"Good morning, Mrs. Landingham."
4656,bartlet,When is Harrison getting in?
4661,bartlet,"Peyton Cabot Harrison. Find out what kind of cigars he likes, what kind of perfume his  wife likes, and have them sent over to their hotel, okay?"
4664,bartlet,We’re using back channels. What is going on with Lillienfield?
4668,bartlet,"We’re gonna get this done, right?"
4676,bartlet,"We looked at everybody, right?"
4678,bartlet,The short list. We looked at Mendoza?
4682,bartlet,"Yeah, you’re right. I’ll see you later."
4684,bartlet,"Good morning, gentlemen. Sorry to keep you waiting. Let’s go."
4685,bartlet,Good morning. Good morning. Hang on a second.
4686,bartlet,Good morning. Keep your seats.
4690,bartlet,Do this for me. Put together some information on Roberto Mendoza.
4691,toby,"Sir... it’s natural to have second thoughts, but..."
4692,bartlet,No. I just want to be able to know something. There’s gonna be a lot of questions.  I don’t want it to be “we had a Hispanic on the short list.”
4693,toby,What is it you’re looking for?
4694,bartlet,The reason we didn’t go with him.
4695,toby,The reason we didn’t go with him is because Harrison said yes.
4696,bartlet,Let’s do better than that.
4698,bartlet,"Uh, what’s going on with this drug thing?"
4699,toby,You don’t want a piece of that.
4700,bartlet,All right. I’ll trust ya. Thank you.
4704,toby,He wants me to look at Mendoza. What...?
4712,toby,I know what an unsigned note is.
4716,toby,How do we know Harrison...?
4718,toby,"What, I’m supposed to just trust “the guy on the phone?”"
4721,toby,I’m gonna need the next five minutes the president’s got.
4723,josh,"Ah, he’s got a half government oversight committee. These are the people who literally  decide if we get heat and electricity in the White House."
4729,josh,I met you. I talked to you. I hired you. You know anybody around here who uses drugs?
4731,josh,You want to tell me who they are?
4733,josh,Good for you. Consider yourself interviewed.
4735,josh,"Donna, I’ve seen your records."
4737,josh,You need to learn that “no parking” means no parking.
4740,josh,What makes you think that everyone here can pass a drug test?
4741,josh," Oh, okay. Problem solved."
4742,josh,"I would think that in this day and age, people would be more comfortable knowing that they  will not now, nor will they ever be forced to turn over evidence against themselves. And  please, do not try and paint your position as anything other than preservation of a spotlight."
4743,josh, So what do you think’s really going on here?
4747,c.j.,"For those who didn’t understand me the first nine times, we are looking into this."
4748,c.j.,These questions haven’t been blunt yet?
4749,c.j.,"No, and you’re forgiven."
4750,c.j.,"We have 1300 people on the payroll, Chris. That’s a lot of information to gather, and  it’s not like we were loaded with free time before. And let me just add that as no one  and nothing here has been subpoenaed, and Mr. Lillienfield has offered nothing to support  his very bizarre claim, we’re not feeling the real need to get this done in a hurry."
4751,c.j.,Thank you. That’s all.  Set fire to the room. Do it now.
4754,c.j., I left my notebook somewhere.
4756,c.j.,"I really don’t need your tips, Danny."
4758,c.j.,I don’t have time for a little basketball game!
4760,josh,Danny. You got a minute?
4761,josh,Do you have any information?
4762,josh,Would you tell me if you did?
4763,josh,You know what kind of information.
4764,josh,You know no one knows where I got it.
4768,josh,What’s he trying to hit?
4770,josh,Nobody said it’s Harrison.
4773,josh,She likes goldfish. Can’t get enough of them.
4774,bartlet,"Here’s an interesting statement.  “I join Judge Black, insomuch as while enjoying  my privacy, I am compelled to admit that government has a right to invade it unless  specifically prohibited by some specific Constitutional provision.” Unquote."
4776,bartlet,Why isn’t this ever been brought up?
4778,bartlet,"We spent two months vetting our homerun nominee, he doesn’t believe in a privacy guarantee,  and it never came up?"
4779,toby,"It was simply never an issue in any order to be handed down, and if I may sir, we don’t  know for sure that he’s the author of the document..."
4781,toby,"...If he is, I don’t think we can necessarily hold a 55 year old man responsible..."
4783,toby,...for something he wrote when he’s 26.
4785,bartlet, When does Harrison get in?
4787,bartlet,I want him first thing in the morning.
4789,bartlet,"When was the last time either of you slept, I don’t care. Get ready for this."
4796,bartlet,I want to meet Mendoza.
4798,toby,Does Mendoza know why he’s coming here?
4799,toby,Is there such a thing as the president’s...?
4801,toby,That must have taxed your considerable creativity.
4803,bartlet,"Judge Harrison, first thing’s first, are you the author of this unsigned note?"
4804,bartlet,"When I was 26, I wrote a paper supporting the deregulation of Far East trade barriers.  Nearly got thrown out of the London School of Economics. I was young and stupid, and  trying to make some noise."
4805,bartlet,I’m gonna bring Toby Ziegler and Sam Seaborn in here and talk about this a little bit.
4807,josh,"Toby, you got a minute?"
4808,toby,They’re about to call me in.
4811,josh,He doesn’t acknowledge the protection?
4813,josh,When were you gonna tell me this?
4814,toby,Number one: I don’t report to you.
4816,toby,Number two: He wrote the paper a quarter century ago.
4817,josh,He hasn’t changed his mind.
4818,toby,We don’t know whether he changed his mind or not.
4819,josh,We don’t care whether he changed his mind or not. You’re painting a picture for the president.
4820,toby,The president can paint his own picture.
4821,josh,"Yeah, but he listens to you.  When did we get the idea that Harrison was our guy?  When we used to talk it was never Harrison."
4828,josh," I was interrogating this intern from the Legislative Liaison’s Office, and  she broke down crying while telling me about the bong she had made out of an eggplant."
4830,josh,I used to use a potato.
4832,josh," Lillienfield’s not after that kid in the Liaison’s  Office, and he’s not even after the Senior Staff."
4834,josh,"Leo, you... know the worst kept secret in Washington... is that you’re a recovering  alcoholic, right?"
4836,josh,"Leo, you’re... Boston-Irish Catholic. Back there and back then, a drinking problem  wasn’t a problem.  This isn’t what he’s after... Were you maybe into something  that wasn’t so acceptable?"
4843,josh,You’re Leo McGarry. You’re not gonna be taken down by this... small fraction of a man.  I won’t permit it.
4847,bartlet,"Peyton, do I have the right to put on an ugly plaid jacket and a loud polka-dot tie and  walk down Main Street?"
4848,bartlet,Where in the Constitution is that right guaranteed?
4849,bartlet,"What about the use of cream in my coffee? Surely, there can be no free speech argument  to be made there?"
4850,bartlet,So you have no objection to the state of New Hampshire passing a law banning use of cream  in coffee?
4851,bartlet,As I lose the votes of coffee drinkers everywhere.
4854,c.j.,The word “subpoena” appears in the lead in every story of this morning’s papers.
4859,c.j.," The crackers, Danny. The cheese things that you have at a party?"
4869,toby,"There are natural laws, judge."
4872,bartlet,"This Sam is young, drives me nuts too, but he took you off for a ride, sir, because that’s  what I told him to do."
4873,bartlet,"I understand, Peyton. Could you give us a little time, please? We’ll make you comfortable  while you’re waiting."
4876,toby,"With a guaranteed confirmation we’re sending out the door based on a 30-year-old paper,  which by the way, no one will know about but us."
4877,bartlet,You don’t think the guy who called Sam wouldn’t know how to call a senator’s office?
4878,toby,"Mr. President, if this is really about abortion, we already talked about..."
4883,josh,You think Mendoza would be a bad justice?
4885,josh,"He didn’t rule in favor of it, Mandy. He’s not recommending it. He’s ruled that the state  has no right to interfere with it."
4886,josh,"And listening to you sometimes, I honestly wish you’d narrow it, so..."
4888,josh," New York City Police Department ’65 to ’76, Assistant  District Attorney Brooklyn ’76 to ’80, Assistant U.S. Attorney Eastern District, Federal  District Judge, Eastern District -- Let me tell you something, Mendoza went to Law School  the hard way. He got shot in the leg, and when they offered him a hundred percent  dispensation, he took a desk job instead and went to law school at night. He’s brilliant,  decisive, compassionate, and experienced. And if you don’t think that he’s America’s  idea of a jurist, then you don’t have enough faith in Americans."
4889,josh," Well, I mean, just the law of large numbers says We got to win one one of  these days, right?"
4890,josh,So let’s make it a good one.
4892,bartlet,"I’m sure we’re almost done. Sam, what else you got?"
4912,bartlet,Did you have a drink yesterday?
4914,bartlet,Are you gonna have one today?
4916,bartlet,That’s all you ever have to say to me.
4918,bartlet,"You fought in a war, got me elected, and you run the country. I think we all owe you  one, don’t you?"
4919,bartlet,Did Harrison get off okay?
4921,bartlet,"I’ll bet it has.  Do you have any more questions, Sam?"
4924,toby,"Judge, without knowing details of special circumstance, what would you say of someone  being fired from refusing to take a drug test at the order of the president?"
4928,bartlet,"Judge Mendoza, would it surprise you to learn that for the past few months, your name  has been in the short list of candidates for the bench?"
4929,bartlet,"Well, then this is gonna knock your socks off. Tomorrow evening at 5 o’clock, I am  naming you as my nominee to be the next associate justice of the United States Supreme  Court. You were not the first choice, but you are the last one, and the right one.   Will you accept the nomination?"
4931,bartlet,Thank you. Sam and Toby will be in charge of your confirmation.
4933,toby,"It’s gonna be an excruciating battle, Mr. Justice, one I have no intention of losing."
4934,bartlet,"What do you say, Leo? You up for a good fight?"
4936,bartlet,Good. Let the good fight begin.
4938,c.j.,With the Santa hats on?
4942,toby,Someone tell me why I’m standing here.
4949,toby,How do you know these things?
4956,toby,Coming of the new millennium?
4962,toby,"It’s not the new millennium, but I’ll just let it drop."
4964,toby,It is not the new millennium. The year 2000 is the last year of the millennium. It’s not  the first one of the next.
4966,toby,Steven J. Gould needs to look at a calendar.
4968,toby,"Yes, it’s tough to resolve. Yes, you have to look at a calendar."
4970,toby,"I’m arguing now, I’ll call them back."
4974,c.j.,So technically the millennium is still a year away? 
4976,c.j.,"Donnie, would you tell them I’m on my way over to see the President?"
4977,c.j.,Who? What did you call... what did he call me?
4980,toby,I was at the coroner’s office. They told me to come here.
4988,toby,"Well, that’s my coat. I gave that coat to the Goodwill. There must have been a... "
4989,toby,"Yeah.  Listen, this isn’t a crime scene is it?"
4990,toby,"See, I got the call an hour ago, I went to the coroner’s office. I’m just wondering why  the body’s still here."
4991,toby,And then you’re gonna call the V.A. right?
4992,toby, Tattoo on his forearm is Marine Battalion Second of the Seventh. This guy  was in Korea.
4996,josh,"Good morning Donna, and a Merry Christmas to you and your whole Protestant family."
4998,josh,As you can see I have not yet bought your Christmas present.
5000,josh,That and how I scrape together the ten bucks.
5002,josh,Of Christmas gift suggestions?
5004,josh," “Ski pants, ski boots, ski hat, ski goggles, ski gloves, ski poles.” I’m assuming  you already have skis?"
5008,josh,I should feel that freedom?
5016,josh,"I, uh, need to speak to Leo."
5018,josh,He wants to talk about your Christmas present.
5022,josh,Yeah. I’ll give that a lot of thought.
5024,josh,This is quite an operation.
5028,josh,I’m tired of waiting for the other shoe to drop.
5030,josh,"Lillienfield’s got this information. He’s gonna hold it till after Christmas when people  are watching. I don’t want to tell you too much, but I want to make an attempt at a  preemptive strike."
5040,josh,I’m saying something to keep in our pockets.
5042,josh,"Lillienfield is coming down the mountain. Leo, this is no joke."
5052,josh,"Oh, well we ought to gauge reaction before we say anything."
5059,c.j.,"The President is scheduled to leave for New Hampshire tomorrow morning at precisely  10 a.m. on the dot, no hold ups, no delays, which means he ought to be leaving around  noon. He’ll spend Christmas Eve at the Manchester house, then attend Christmas services  with his family in the morning."
5061,c.j.,"Yeah, his name is Lowell Lydell, he’s seventeen years old, he’s in critical condition  at Saint Paul Memorial Hospital with a severely fractured skull, massive internal  hemorrhaging, and various broken bones and lacerations. We’ll keep you updated through  local authorities."
5062,c.j.,"Yes, I do. Though I suppose the best time to do that was the day before Lowell Lydell  got his brains beaten out and not the day after. Who’s next?"
5063,toby, Walter Hufnagle. I don’t know... I don’t know! I’ve been holding on for--  I say I’ve been holding on for the better part of-- Sure. Yeah.
5065,toby,"A homeless Korean War Vet died of exposure out on the mall last night. I don’t know if  his family’s been contacted, I don’t know... what kind of burial..."
5067,toby,Don’t worry about it. What do you need?
5074,josh,"Donna, I can assure you I’m giving your Christmas list the consideration it..."
5080,josh,The two of you shouldn’t be...
5088,josh,"For the moment nothing, we’re gonna--"
5090,josh,We’re gonna wait and see how-- 
5092,josh,There’s not much else we can do.
5095,josh,Could you stop looking at me with the face?
5097,josh,Like I just killed your hamster?
5103,josh,I know... I have to work.
5105,c.j.,"Okay kids, remember the drill, in a big voice you’ll say your name, your grade and then  you’ll ask the President the question that you and your teacher have prepared and  written down on your index card.  Okay, how about a big, “Good morning Mr. President!” when he comes in the  room? Here we go."
5106,bartlet,Oh that sounded pretty weak to me. Let’s try it again. 
5107,bartlet,That’s better. Now who are all these people making a ruckus and tracking up my floor?   You! What’s your name?
5108,bartlet,"And when are you gonna get taller, huh? What are you, fifteen, sixteen years old?"
5109,bartlet,"Well, all right then, you’re fine. All right, lets go. Come on, I’m a busy man. I am,  after all, the President of Bulgaria."
5110,bartlet,"Now, wait a second. That’s not right. I’m not the President of Bulgaria. I am the  President of the Great Kingdom of Luxembourg."
5111,bartlet,"Now hold on, I know I’m the President of something... "
5112,bartlet,"Yes! Thank you. I am the President of the United States of America. Now, who has a question?"
5114,bartlet,My favorite part about being President?
5115,bartlet,I’m doing it right now.  Who’s next? All right. 
5116,bartlet, Wait. Hang on a second.
5117,bartlet,"Okay.  Apparently, there’s a group of kids in the other room that I might  like better."
5119,bartlet,Okay. Send some flowers. Then I’ll call his parents. 
5121,bartlet,"Okay.  All right, now on with the questions. Now wait a minute, when you address me, please  bear in mind that you are speaking to His Royal Majesty, The King of all England."
5129,c.j.,"First of all, I barely grazed the gas. Second of all, why not?"
5131,c.j.,I know where I stand on this.
5133,c.j.,They threw rocks at his head.
5135,c.j.,Ah. I’ll keep my food off the gas.
5137,c.j.,What’s your secret service code name?
5145,c.j.,The flamingo is a ridiculous looking bird.
5147,c.j.,I know I’m not ridiculous looking.
5149,c.j.,I’m gonna go talk to someone.
5157,josh,I need to ask you something. I need to ask you about your friend.
5159,josh,"Nothing, listen...  you would describe her as, I’m sorry, what was her name again?"
5168,josh,"Sam, I need to know if she would divulge the name or names of any influential Republican  members of congress that she might have..."
5174,josh,There’s a thing that’s gonna happen.
5176,josh,Lillienfield knows that Leo’s a recovering alcoholic. 
5178,josh,"Yeah, but they don’t know that there were pills. There was Valium. He was in rehab."
5186,josh,"I’m fairly sure that’s why he started this in the first place. Lillienfield’s going hunting.  Sam, we owe Leo everything. I mean everything."
5191,toby,"No. No. Just... I’m not a visitor. I was, uh... I’m not the police. I was... "
5192,toby,"Occurred to me that maybe he slept there a lot, maybe you knew him."
5194,toby,"I’m just trying to contact someone that might, you know, be interested that he died."
5195,toby,Thanks.  You a veteran?
5200,josh, Good morning Mr. President.
5201,bartlet,"Josh, what are you doing right now?"
5202,josh,I’m helping prepare a strategy for the European economic summit in February.
5205,bartlet,"Seriously, take an hour and come with us."
5208,josh,I don’t understand. How are you going shopping?
5209,bartlet,Oh I sneak out every now and then.
5211,bartlet,"Yes, couple of agents, an unmarked black suburban. They tell the manager, they clear  the store, I’m in, I’m out. It’s like nothing ever happened."
5213,bartlet,Did you know that there’s an underground tunnel out of here?
5215,bartlet,I haven’t been able to find it even though I search almost everyday.
5217,bartlet,"To a place called Rare Books, you know what they sell?"
5220,bartlet,Tell her to leave me alone. Sheila!
5221,bartlet,This is a Christmas thing I’m doing Mandy; we don’t have to make hay out of it.
5223,josh,An hour with you in a rare bookstore? Couldn’t you just drop me off the top of the  Washington monument instead?
5224,bartlet,"It’s Christmas, Josh! No reason we can’t do both. "
5228,c.j.,He suddenly realized he’d forgotten to get you a Christmas gift.
5232,c.j.,"Well I’ll tell you what, give me a couple of hours to put together a list of reasons  why I shouldn’t, then we’ll compare them and see where we are.  My secret service code name is Flamingo. "
5237,c.j.,What do you and Josh have going on tonight?
5239,c.j.,I just meant did you want to come over for dinner.
5241,c.j.,What did you think I meant?
5243,c.j.,"Okay. Yeah, that’s right."
5245,c.j.,What did you think I meant?
5247,c.j.,Then why did you say nothing if you are going to Bermuda tonight?
5251,c.j.,Okay. Sam.  What have you and Josh have going on tonight?
5253,bartlet,"Oooh! “The Fables of Phaedrus,” 1886, first edition, red leather label, gilt lettering,  engraved frontice. Phaedrus, you know, who was a slave, but later granted his freedom  by Augustus, wrote his animal fables in iambic verse."
5258,josh,"A book which if I was stuck with it on a desert island, I still wouldn’t read it,  “The Adventures of James Capen Adams, Mountaineer and Grizzly Bear Hunter of California.”  I believe I would eat this book before I read it."
5259,bartlet,"So, you won’t change your mind?"
5261,bartlet,So you’re gonna sit around in your hotel room by yourself?
5263,bartlet,"Oh! So you’re gonna work on Christmas? Good, that makes me feel better."
5265,bartlet,"Come to Manchester, stay at the house."
5267,bartlet,"I wasn’t planning on doing that, but now that you suggest it."
5273,bartlet,I’m not worried about it Leo.
5275,bartlet,"It’ll be fine, these things can go away by themselves."
5277,bartlet,I don’t want to talk about an exit strategy.
5279,bartlet,I really don’t. It’s gonna be fine.
5281,bartlet,"All right. You know Zoey is starting Georgetown in two weeks, I was thinking about  getting this for her. “The Nature of Things. A Viviscalic Poem Translated from the  Latin of Titus Lucrecius Carus.”"
5282,bartlet,Yeah. Because it’s got brown Moroccan spine labels.
5283,bartlet,"All right, thanks.  Thank you all, Merry Christmas! "
5290,bartlet,"“Life of Epicurus”, two volumes."
5292,toby,"Excuse me. Ah, excuse me, I was wondering if by any chance you know a man named of  Walter Hufnagle?"
5294,toby,"I wasn’t looking for him. I was, uh..."
5296,toby,"Oh, there’s no problem. Down on the end?"
5298,toby,Excuse me. Mr. Hufnagle?
5299,toby,"Are you, uh, Walter Hufnagle’s brother?"
5300,toby,I’m afraid I have some very bad news. Walter died last night.
5301,toby,It was a very cold night.
5302,toby,"I’m, I’m... I’m Toby Zeigler. Uh, Walter was wearing my coat and it had my business card... "
5304,toby,"George, did you know your brother fought in Korea? "
5306,toby,"No, uh, he was in the Marines about forty-five years ago."
5308,toby,It’s called the Purple Heart. It’s for getting wounded in battle.
5310,toby,"No, no. Uh, a lot of people were wounded or even killed."
5311,toby,"No, no I was-- Anyway, uh, I wasn’t sure if anyone had, you know, contacted you."
5312,toby,"Yeah, it was -- it was pretty cold."
5313,toby,Yeah. I’m sorry. Goodnight.  I’m a very powerful person. And I would like to arrange it.
5314,toby, Are you gonna be here tomorrow?
5315,toby, So that if I come and pick you up in the morning and I’ll bring you back after.
5322,c.j.,You are a reporter. I’m The Press Secretary. It’s an unavoidable conflict of interest.  It would hurt my reputation. It would hurt your reputation. Your editors would obviously... 
5324,c.j.,I’m reading you my list.
5326,c.j.,You didn’t make a list.
5327,c.j.,You said you made a list.
5328,c.j.,"Well, I made an actual list."
5329,c.j.,What did you come in here for?
5330,c.j.,"You already gave me a goldfish Danny, what more could a girl possible want? "
5336,c.j.,"I’m rebuffing his advances, Leo."
5338,c.j.,You told me to float a test balloon.
5340,c.j.,They made him say “Hail Mary’s” as they beat him to death. This was a crime of entertainment.
5341,c.j.,"Beyond the crime itself is a manifestation of racism, or sexism, or anti Semitism or  homophobia that are only a tip of the iceberg of the pathology troubling this country."
5349,c.j.,Want me to come cook you something?
5368,josh," Yeah, I am. And I got to tell you, I could care less about your indignation  right now. A man has left himself open to the kind of attack from which men in my business  don't recover. Now if our tactics seem less than civilized it’s because so are our attackers  and in any event I don’t feel like standing here taking a civics lesson from a hooker!"
5370,josh,"We don’t need your cooperation, Laurie, one of your guys wrote you a check and the I.R.S.  works for me."
5371,josh,Just give me a name. What do you want? Money? I’ll give you money!
5373,josh,"No, I didn’t.  In fact I’m sorry. I apologize. That was very rude."
5376,c.j.,"Yeah, but we’re not just talking about burning a cross on someone’s lawn. People are  getting killed."
5383,c.j.,I’m saying this is an abstract theory. It’s not enough to say we’re protecting people’s  civil rights; we have to actually do it. Plus it has the added benefit of being good politics.
5385,c.j.,We’ll get into it after the break?
5404,josh,It was mine. Sam was a reluctant accomplice. You had us tailed?
5429,josh,It’s gonna get bad before it gets better.
5433,c.j.,"There’s been no change with the Presidents departure time of 10 a.m. so we’re still  looking at about noon. This is a half day for us, so I’m gonna make it a half day for  you too. There is no more news from The White House. The lid is on. Have a Merry Christmas. "
5435,c.j.,"Answer me this, and when you do bear in mind there’s a lot riding on it."
5438,c.j.,Don’t you think imposing additional penalties for hate-motivated crimes is a powerful  statement by society against tolerance?
5439,c.j.,"Boy, was that the wrong answer."
5440,c.j.,I don’t agree with you.
5441,c.j.,Take me out tonight and convince me.
5443,c.j.,I’m not gonna say it again.
5444,c.j., I didn’t ask you out. You asked me out about forty-nine times and I’m  saying yes to one of them.
5445,c.j.,You understand we’re having dinner right?
5446,c.j.,We’re not having a fling.
5447,c.j.,"This is a business dinner, in fact bring your notebook. "
5448,c.j., My secret service name is Flamingo.
5449,c.j.,I have to feed my fish.
5454,josh,It’s got a molted calf cover and original drab boards.
5456,josh,I wrote a note inside. 
5457,josh,"Donna, don’t get emotional. Donna, don’t get... let’s try and maintain some kind of... "
5463,bartlet,Hello everybody. Welcome to The White House.  Joey. Welcome to the White House.
5464,toby,Good morning Mrs. Landingham.
5473,bartlet,"Merry Christmas, Nancy. "
5477,toby,"I’m fine. Thank you, sir."
5478,bartlet,Apparently I’ve arranged for an honor guard for somebody.
5479,toby,"Yes, sir, I’m sorry, I... "
5480,bartlet,"No, no, just tell me, is there anything else I’ve arranged for? We’re still in NATO, right?"
5483,toby,"A homeless man died last night, a Korean War Veteran, who was wearing a coat I had gave  to the Goodwill. It had my card in it."
5484,bartlet,"Toby, you’re not responsible... "
5485,toby,"An hour and twenty minutes for the ambulance to get there. A Lance Corporal, United  States Marine Corps, Second of the Seventh. The guy got better treatment at Panmunjong."
5486,bartlet,"Toby, if we start pulling strings like this, you don’t think every homeless veteran  would come out of the woodworks? "
5489,toby,I’m going to pick up his brother and go there now. 
5497,josh,"Well, it’s good exercise."
5499,josh,"You’ll be doing more than that, Donna. You’ll be reading the greens, you’ll be helping  with club selection."
5502,josh,Is this Claypool again?
5503,josh, Why do you let him in the building?
5504,josh,"Gimme that.   This is like the 43rd time -- This is Freedom Watch, right?"
5505,josh,"Yeah, you guys are real patriots."
5506,josh, Being subpoenaed? No. Why would that inconvenience me?
5507,josh,Thank you. Drop dead.  It’s what I do now. I’m a professional hostile witness. 
5511,josh,No. Real golfers don’t use carts.
5517,josh,"I would wait until spring, but I’d want you to start practicing with that bag right away."
5518,josh,"Good evening, Mrs. Landingham."
5520,josh," Yes, thanks. The President asked me to come by."
5522,bartlet,Keep your seats.  Admiral Fitzwallace?
5523,bartlet,Is it clear what India’s objective is?
5524,bartlet,"When you say “the Indian army,” what are we talking about?"
5525,bartlet,Five guys in a Humvee? What?
5527,bartlet, In the last twenty-five minutes?
5528,bartlet,"300,000 is an awfully large piece of troop movement to have been on a whim."
5530,bartlet,All I’m trying to do right now? I’m trying to avoid making eye contact with the CIA Director.
5531,bartlet,"300,000 troops? I can’t move my motorcade from K Street to Connecticut without it showing  up on a weather satellite."
5532,bartlet,"Pick it up again, would you please?"
5533,bartlet,Any chance this is an exercise?
5536,bartlet,"Oh, I wouldn’t worry about that, that’s probably not important information."
5539,bartlet,"All right. I’m ordering the Crisis Task Force activated, and I want you to prepare to  give me a national security briefing. Thank you."
5543,toby,"You’re saying our guy in Pakistan, or their guy here?"
5545,toby,We haven’t appointed one yet.
5550,toby,"Good evening, Mrs. Landingham."
5552,toby,What are you talking to me for?
5558,josh,All this happened without the CIA knowing about it?
5559,bartlet,"I’ve already had words. TOBY, the U.N. Security Council is meeting in an emergency  session to try to affect a cease-fire."
5560,toby,"Well, I feel better already, Mr. President."
5563,toby,"How could the CIA miss 300,000 armed people walking all over-"
5564,bartlet,"They didn’t exactly miss them. In fact, they’ve got a very good photo now."
5565,toby,"Yeah, but the idea is to spot them before they cross the border, right?"
5568,josh,"For the moment we’re just talking about conventional weapons, right?"
5569,bartlet,"Toby, how much do you know about India and Pakistan?"
5570,toby,I know that any war between these two countries that begins with conventional weapons  isn’t gonna end that way.
5575,c.j.,I’m sorry. Charlie and Mrs. Landingham stepped away. Should I go back and wait in the...
5577,c.j.,Can I tell the room there’s a full lid?
5579,c.j.,Okay. I’ll send ‘em home.
5581,c.j.,"Thank you, Mr. President. "
5588,josh,Under the Freedom of Information Act. It’s reported that I was running the internal  investigation after Lillienfield accused us all of being on drugs.
5592,josh,I’m being deposed at lunch tomorrow.
5594,josh,I’m not bringing anyone.
5600,josh,Thanks for the pep talk.
5605,josh,I know. I’m just sayin’. 
5631,c.j.,Hi. We’re gonna have a briefing by the Treasury Department on the market adjustment...
5632,c.j.,"That’s what we’ve been asked to call it. That’s going to be nine tomorrow morning.  With that, the lid is full, you can all go home."
5635,c.j.,"I think you need to get a new source at the Pentagon, Bruce."
5636,c.j.,What kind of troop movement?
5638,c.j.,"I think someone’s havin’ a little fun with you, Bruce."
5639,c.j.,I was just in the Oval Office ten minutes ago.
5640,c.j.,"Have a good night, everybody."
5643,bartlet,"Well, we’ve got ourselves a ballgame."
5648,toby,What kind of information are they looking for?
5650,toby,It wasn’t an investigation.
5654,toby,"Oh, good, I like the sound of this."
5657,c.j.,Hi. You know what this is about?
5658,toby,Yeah. I stopped by your office before but...
5659,c.j.,I was at the reception.
5664,c.j.,This happened last night?
5666,c.j.,That’s what you all were talking about when I walked into the Oval Office?
5668,c.j.,You told me the lid was on.
5670,c.j.,"I got the question, Leo. A guy had a Pentagon source, I denied it. I called it ridiculous."
5674,c.j.,A couple of destroyers?
5676,c.j.,The guy hit it right on the button. I made fun of him.
5678,c.j.,I guess that’s what I’ll do.
5681,c.j.,I’m fine. We’re across the hall?
5683,josh,White House Deputy Chief of Staff.
5684,josh,"Since President Bartlet was sworn in, 12 months ago."
5685,josh,I wouldn’t call it an investigation.
5686,josh,It wasn’t that serious.
5687,josh,"Whoa. Almost tripped me up in that clever web of words. No, I would consider drug use  in the White House to be serious; I wouldn’t consider my investigation serious, and  the way you know it wasn’t serious is that I was the one running it."
5688,josh,"Congressman Lillienfield held a press conference in which he claimed that one in three  White House staffers use drugs. I was asked to discover what, if anything, might have  caused him to say that."
5689,josh,The Chief of Staff and the Communications Director.
5691,josh,"Yes, and I can save us all a lot of time by telling you that there are no records of  my investigation. "
5692,josh,I mentioned it to a few people.
5699,josh,"My assistant, Donna Moss."
5700,josh,I told them that I had to waste a day on this deposition.
5701,josh,I probably told them that I consider these moronic lawsuits of yours to be...
5702,josh,"Because you have consistently acted not as someone determined to get the truth, but  someone who hates President Bartlet, hates people who support President Bartlet, and  is looking to make headlines and money. Now you have two hours today, and two hours  tomorrow. Look, will somebody please offer me some coffee? "
5703,toby,What the hell kind of briefing is this?
5704,toby,Where’d you get this stuff?
5706,toby," C.J., we’re getting someone from State..."
5714,toby,She wants to work for Mike Brace?
5718,toby,"Yes, hello. Is this a joke?"
5726,toby,Are you shilling for her?
5730,toby,And please don’t do that.
5732,toby,"Joe, can you assess the command and control situation?"
5733,toby,"Good, ‘cause we were waiting for a truly terrifying part."
5735,bartlet,"Well, bring in Dr. Strangelove and we’re all set."
5737,bartlet,There’s an India expert I want to bring in.
5740,bartlet,You guys are gonna love him.
5745,bartlet,"Lord John Marbury, former ambassador to New Delhi from the Court of Saint James."
5750,bartlet,We can hide the women. But the man deserves a drink.
5752,bartlet,Let’s get him on a plane.
5759,toby,I feel like I should say something to C.J.
5768,c.j.,"In the next few weeks, it’s going to be important that the White House reassure  Americans and the world that the President has a firm grip on the crisis and is  working hard to defuse it."
5769,c.j.,They’re misspelling ‘New Delhi.’
5770,c.j.,"Hey, I’m happy when they use an ‘h’ at all."
5772,toby,Okay.  I was warned that coming to talk to you might be insulting to your  professionalism.
5773,c.j.,"Well, you wouldn’t want to do that."
5774,toby,I wasn’t ready for the press yet.
5775,c.j.,Could've told me that before sending me in there.
5776,c.j.,I flatly denied it. I said I was in the Oval Office ten minutes ago and nothing’s going on.
5777,toby,They don’t think you lied to them.
5778,c.j.,"I know that. They think you lied to me, which is what happened. They don’t know me.  I’m from nowhere. I was just starting to get credible. I was just starting to get  their respect. You know how long it’s going to take me to get it back?"
5780,c.j.,"Don’t ask C.J., she doesn’t know anything."
5781,toby,There is a concern that you’re too friendly with the press.
5783,toby,We know it’s important that you have a friendly relationship with them-
5784,c.j.,It’s important for all of us.
5786,c.j.,Does this have to do with Danny Concannon?
5787,toby,People see you with Danny.
5789,toby,"This is one time, and if we erred, it’s on the side of trying to-"
5790,c.j.,You sent me in there uninformed so that I’d lie to the press-
5791,toby,We sent you in there uninformed because we thought there was a chance you couldn’t.
5792,c.j.,Okay. I have all this work to do.
5796,toby,Got to go back tomorrow?
5799,josh,You get 450 bucks an hour?
5801,josh,Then mind your own business.
5803,josh,It’s nothing. It’s this guy.
5805,josh,"Oh, absolutely, ‘cause in the middle of an international crisis, what better place  to put our resources?"
5806,toby,"It’s two hours, just do it."
5810,bartlet,This ought to be delightful.
5811,bartlet,"Thanks for staying late, Charlie."
5814,bartlet,My daughter asked you out?
5815,bartlet,I should have locked her in the dungeon.
5816,bartlet,I could have built one.
5817,bartlet,"Charlie, you have picked the absolute worst time in the world to talk to me about this."
5820,bartlet,Yes.  He wants to go out with Zoey.
5823,bartlet,"Thank you for seeing us so late, and on such short notice."
5826,bartlet,"Mr. Ambassador, it is crucial that we join together to bring about a cease-fire and  then a pullback, in Kashmir, before this conflict takes another escalating step."
5830,bartlet,"Well, this just keeps getting better and better."
5844,josh,Is there another Mike Brace?
5846,josh,She understands he’s a Republican right?
5848,josh,"Oh, I’m gonna kill her."
5850,josh,"Yeah, that’s a big 10-4."
5855,bartlet,"Please, sit down. We’ve been trying to phone your Prime Minister without any luck.  Can you help us out there?"
5856,bartlet,"Mr. Ambassador, I stood at a podium this morning, and I publicly condemned the incursion  by Indian forces."
5857,bartlet,My condemnation might have been stronger if my State Department didn’t feel that the  Indian action was provoked.
5858,bartlet,You deny there has been Pakistani movement in the Neutral Zone?
5860,bartlet,Hang on. Look. The U.S. is committed to finding a reasonable solution to the dispute.
5861,bartlet,"Whatever the language, I know that you will agree with me that we have to find a way  for these two countries to exist together in a global community."
5862,bartlet,I’d imagine the Indian ambassador is going to say roughly the same thing about you.
5863,bartlet,Yes.  Thank you for coming.
5865,bartlet,I’ll take the Indian ambassador in the Oval Office.
5866,bartlet,"And then if you could just ask the Secret Service to step in and kill me, please."
5867,bartlet,Zoey just walked right up to him and asked him out.
5869,bartlet,"See, but a dungeon would have put an end to that."
5871,bartlet,I think you’re trying to cover up the fact that you’re enjoying this.
5881,bartlet,I don’t have a racial problem.
5883,bartlet,I’m Spencer Tracy at the end of “Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner.”
5887,bartlet,"My problem is not that she’s white, he’s black, it’s that she’s a girl and he’s not.  To say nothing of he’s older than she is."
5889,bartlet,"Yeah, but a guy learns a lot in those two years."
5891,bartlet,Tracy was good in that movie.
5895,bartlet,"I was looking a lot better before your country breached about fourteen cease-fire  conditions without so much as a phone call, so let’s sit down and talk. Charlie,  please close the door."
5897,josh,This is the seventh lawsuit you’ve brought against the White House and the fourth time  you’ve deposed me and demanded to see documents that don’t exist.
5900,josh,I would imagine that there are.
5904,josh,Drinking isn’t against the law.
5910,josh,There was no investigation.
5914,josh,This is a piece of paper obtained illegally.
5920,bartlet,"My frustration, Mr. Ambassador, is that both you and the Pakistanis have nuclear weapons  and a tendency to get cranky."
5921,bartlet,"Well, it was nice spending this time with you."
5924,bartlet,"Every time he talks about colonial Western imperialism, I always want to remind him  that the United States is also a revolutionary country that threw off its colonial masters."
5931,bartlet,Thank you for coming. How was your flight?
5938,bartlet,"We need your take on the situation, John."
5939,bartlet,The world is coming apart at the seams.
5941,c.j.," -- the Earl of Sherbourne, he is the great great grandson of a former  Viceroy and for thirteen years served as the Queen’s minister to either India or  Pakistan. Lord Marbury is here to council the President, and if you think this is  all starting to sound like a Gilbert and Sullivan operetta, I don’t blame you a bit. "
5944,toby,I feel that I didn’t have the opportunity to properly articulate my argument.
5945,c.j.,"Either I’m a trusted member of the communications staff or I’m not, Toby, what was your  argument?"
5947,c.j.,That wasn’t your argument.
5948,toby," It was my argument a little while ago, when I was arguing in my head."
5956,toby,I was trying to do it nicer than that.
5959,c.j.,"You were the one who said “India’s invaded Pakistan, let’s not tell C.J.?”"
5960,toby,I didn’t say it like that.
5961,c.j.,"Well, how’d you say it?"
5968,josh," No, actually, it didn’t. Thanks."
5974,josh,"Listen, I need to tell you guys something."
5989,bartlet,I want to ask him to stay a little bit and help us out.
5991,bartlet,You two are going to become good friends.
5993,bartlet,"For the first couple of weeks, so did I."
5999,josh,"It didn’t go well. Claypool’s got a copy of your records from rehab. Either he got  ‘em from Lillienfield or the other way around. I was in a position where I was gonna  perjure myself, so SAM ended the deposition. Claypool’s next step is to call a reporter,  so I’m pretty sure you’re going to be read about this soon, so I wanted to ask you,  does your family know?"
6001,josh,"‘Cause if they don’t, Leo..."
6007,josh,Then we’re here for whatever you need. We just wanted to come in and tell you that.
6008,bartlet,Is he still on the phone?
6010,bartlet, There’s a quote from Revelations I’m trying to remember.
6013,bartlet,"Say, listen. My hesitation about your going out with Zoey before, you know, it’s not  ‘cause you’re black."
6016,bartlet,"Still, I want you to go out with her if that’s what you both want to do."
6018,bartlet,"Just remember these two things: She’s nineteen years old, and the 82nd Airborne works for me."
6019,bartlet,"Also this - no kidding. You go out with Zoey, you’re gonna get your picture taken.  There’s gonna be a lot of people not wild about the sight of you and the President’s  daughter. You know what to do with the mail, right?"
6020,bartlet, All right. You keep your head up.
6021,bartlet,Should have built a dungeon.
6022,bartlet," Revelations. It’s about a horse,  and Death was riding on it maybe."
6026,bartlet,"Ah, good, I want you all to meet John."
6032,bartlet,Don’t you ever forget the battles you’ve fought and won.
6035,bartlet,That’s what I’d heard. But all they got was two weeks.
6036,bartlet,"John, I was hoping you’d stick around for a couple of days and help us out."
6038,bartlet,"John, there’s a quote from Revelations..."
6039,bartlet,"Are you frightened, John?"
6042,bartlet,"With nearly 18 million new jobs, wages rising at more than twice the rate of inflation,  the highest home ownership in history, the smallest welfare rolls in 30 years and the  lowest peacetime unemployment since 1957.  I stand before you to report that  America has created the longest peacetime economic expansion in our history. For the  first time in three decades, the budget is balanced. From a deficit of 290 million  dollars just ten years ago..."
6047,toby,"You said million, but let’s move on."
6050,bartlet," From a deficit of 290 billion dollars, just ten... it says “million”  on the TelePrompTer, by the way."
6054,josh,He doesn’t look so good.
6056,josh,He’s pale and he’s sweating.
6058,josh,You think he’s getting sick?
6060,josh,Are his glands swollen?
6064,c.j.,I forgot to feel the President’s glands.
6065,josh,Do you think the joke reflex you use as a defense mechanism is why you have so much  trouble keeping a man?
6067,josh,"I’m saying, we’re 44 hours away from the State of the Union, and he doesn’t look so good."
6068,bartlet,"...And how do we make the American dream of opportunity a reality for all? I came to  this hallowed chamber one year ago, and I see we’re spelling “hallowed” with a pound  sign in the middle of it."
6070,bartlet,The pound sign’s silent?
6072,bartlet,"I came to this hallowed chamber one year ago on a mission: to restore the American  dream for all our people, as we gaze at the vast horizon of possibilities open to us  in the 321st century... Wow, that was ambitious of me, wasn’t it?"
6075,bartlet,"We meant “stronger” here, right?"
6077,bartlet,I’m proud to report our country’s stranger than it was a year ago?
6085,bartlet,Why is everyone asking me that today?
6086,josh,But you don’t look so good.
6088,josh,You’re pale and you’re perspiring.
6090,c.j.,"You should be taking something, sir."
6091,bartlet,"I’m taking many things, C.J."
6093,bartlet,I don’t know. My wife hands me pills. I swallow them with water.
6095,bartlet,Vitamin C. Vitamin B. Is it possible I’m taking something called 'euthanasia'?
6097,bartlet,"Ah, that sounds more like it... Toby?"
6101,c.j.,"Are you actually taking them, or are you just carrying them around in your pocket?"
6102,bartlet," You know, carrying them around in my pocket was a pretty big step for me."
6103,c.j.,You got to take the pills.
6106,bartlet,“How do we make the American dream a reality for all who work for it.” 
6108,bartlet,"You got to add, “who work for it.”"
6111,toby,We’ve decided this two weeks ago.
6112,josh,We’ve seen some pretty compelling polling samples. We need “people who work for it”  and I’ll tell you what else.
6114,josh,“The era of big government is over.”
6115,toby," Oh, when did this happen?"
6116,josh,"This morning, we had a meeting."
6117,toby,We decided to offend poor people?
6118,josh,The people we’re offending won’t be watching the State of the Union.
6119,toby,"Yeah, I can’t imagine why not."
6120,bartlet,"It’s what they’re listening for in welfare reforms, so screw it."
6121,toby,"Alright, but when you get visited in the middle of the night by the ghost of Christmas  future, don’t come running to me."
6122,bartlet,"Damn, Toby, ‘cause you’re exactly who I was gonna come running to."
6123,toby,You don’t look so good.
6124,bartlet,"Well, I’m gazing in the 321st century, man. There’s a lot on my mind."
6127,bartlet,"Oh, dear God. I will take the pills, C.J."
6128,c.j.,Will you take them now?
6129,bartlet,"Yes. I will go to the Oval Office, and pour a glass of water from the Steuben glass  pitcher, which was a gift from the Christian Charity Network there, Skippy."
6131,bartlet,"I’m just saying, before you start calling me, Ebenezer Bartlet, remember, I got a  really nice glass pitcher for just, you know, being a good guy."
6132,toby,"Well, you turned me right around on that one, Mr. President."
6134,bartlet, I will take the pills.
6140,toby,And we haven’t been invited yet?
6144,toby,"Good, cause you know, we want to be able to report that the country’s a lot stranger  than it was a year ago."
6148,bartlet,I don’t need a cardiogram.
6152,bartlet,"I didn’t have a heart attack, Leo. I got the flu, and I don’t need a cardiogram."
6155,bartlet,"Thank you, Mrs. Landingham... Mrs. Landingham how do I look to you?"
6166,toby,"You’re a real cut-up there, Mr. President."
6167,bartlet,101.9 and I still got it.
6169,bartlet,Anybody know if the Celtics won tonight?
6171,bartlet,It was a two-week cease-fire. There’s four days left.
6172,bartlet,What’s Intel saying about the Pakistanis?
6176,bartlet,I’m going to bed. But somebody call me if there’s movement.
6180,c.j.,I actually never thought about it.
6182,c.j.,"The fish is fine, and I need my office."
6184,c.j.,Doesn’t seem to kill you.
6207,c.j.,Does the first lady know?
6211,c.j.,"Yeah, it’s on the Internet right now."
6213,c.j.,Why don’t we do a preemptive...
6215,c.j.,You’ll talk to the press in the morning?
6217,c.j.,"I’m gonna work with you first, okay?"
6220,bartlet," It tested very well. I’m not saying we’re doing it, Toby. I just want to  try it and see how it reads. The era of big government is over... All right. Thanks."
6221,bartlet,I’m feeling roughly the same as I was feeling when you asked me four minutes ago.
6222,bartlet,"It’s okay. This isn’t the worst of it, Charlie. The worst of it’s coming up the stairs  right now."
6233,bartlet,I was wondering when you were gonna notice me.
6240,bartlet,You’re very sexy when you’re in doctor mode you know that? Give me an IV/saline  solution and 100 milligrams of Flumadine. Stat.  I could jump you right now.
6244,bartlet,Fitzwallace called me in the Situation Room. There was more movement in Kashmir.
6248,bartlet,I broke the Steuben glass pitcher in the Oval Office.
6250,bartlet,"Seriously, Abbey, I’m fine."
6256,bartlet,I really don’t remember.
6258,bartlet,Fitzwallace says the Pakistanis are giving command control to some nuclear weapons  to the field.
6260,bartlet,I’m really sorry about the pitcher.
6262,bartlet,I could jump you right now.
6275,josh,Someone from the line of succession is required to be absent from the State of the Union.
6282,josh,Who do you think I should pick?
6286,josh,And where exactly do you fall in the line of succession?
6292,josh,"Yes.  Listen. Be sweet to Margaret and Leo today. This might not be the worst  day of their lives, but it’s got to be in the top five."
6296,josh,"When you left Sierra Tucson, did you start attending meetings? "
6298,c.j.,Don’t say A.A. if they don’t say A.A.
6299,josh," When you left Sierra Tucson, did you start attending meetings?"
6301,josh,Do you still attend them?
6307,josh,How about as often as I need to?
6316,c.j.,Did they raise any objection to a man with your problem in such a sensitive position?
6318,josh,It’s not a totally unreasonable question.
6327,josh,Toby told him last night to...
6335,bartlet,Can I go to the office?
6341,bartlet,Here’s the thing though. I never really saw you study while you were in med school.
6343,bartlet,Do you even know what you’re listening for right now? 
6347,bartlet,I’m going to the office.
6354,bartlet,Alright. I think I’ll stay here for a little bit.
6364,josh,"Because the secretaries of defense, state and treasury are famous faces, and we want  the camera to find them."
6370,josh,Which is why I really don’t care that much.
6372,josh,"Donna, I really don’t anticipate the Capitol Building exploding."
6374,josh,Now you’re bringing me down.
6380,josh,"I read the statement you wrote for the President--sensational, Sam. I’m sorry no one’s  gonna read it."
6387,toby,They’re free to write they’re own speech.
6388,toby,What are your concerns?
6390,toby,This is an opportunity for a pep rally. This is an opportunity to trumpet government.  Why do we want to pretend to be sorry for intruding?
6392,toby,"Why don’t’ you pick your section of the speech. Fight with me about it, and I’ll lose,  and then I can call in the next group."
6393,toby,Pick a section. There’s a line waiting outside. I’ve got 31 hours to-to write this...
6394,toby,The N.E.A.?  Let us open our hymnals to page 22.
6413,josh,I mean N.E.A. is putting up a fight...
6417,josh,I understand you’re being pissed off--
6466,bartlet,I don’t understand. Don’t any of these characters have jobs?
6467,bartlet,They seem to have a lot of free time in the middle of the day.
6468,bartlet,And that woman’s changed her clothes for quite a lot in one afternoon.
6469,bartlet,"Yeah. Would you mind stepping out, Charlie?"
6470,bartlet,"Abbey phoned me up and told me about your conversation. I was diagnosed about seven years  ago. My life expectancy is normal. My particular course of MS is relapsing-remitting,  which means I should experience total recovery after attacks. Abbey gives me injections  of something called Betaseron, and that reduces the frequency. Fever and stress tend to  be two things that induces attacks."
6474,bartlet,You haven’t called me “Jed” since I was elected.
6476,bartlet,‘Cause I wanted to be the President.
6482,bartlet,"When you stood up there today, I was so proud. I wanted to be with you."
6484,bartlet,"I tried to get up, but I fell back down again."
6486,bartlet," I’m so sorry, Leo. I really am."
6489,bartlet,"Yeah, give us a minute, would you please?"
6490,toby,The National Endowment amounts to less than 1/100th of one percent of the total budget  for the federal government. It costs taxpayers 39 cents a year. The arts budget for the  U.S. is equivalent to the arts budget of Sweden.
6491,toby,"You gay bashing, Raymond?"
6492,toby,"I’d start by telling them that Rodgers and Hammerstein wrote Oklahoma, and Arthur Murray  taught ballroom dance, and Arthur Miller did need the N.E.A. to write Death of a Salesman,  but it wasn’t called the N.E.A. back then. It was called W.P.A. and it was Roosevelt’s...  It was Roosevelt’s..."
6494,toby,Thank you everybody. This meeting is over.
6495,bartlet,And a strong shot of whiskey?
6496,bartlet,"What have you got for me, John?"
6504,bartlet,"Your friend, the prime minister?"
6505,bartlet,He’s gonna go for this?
6506,bartlet,"All right, you tell the ambassador we’ll discuss this in three months. In three months,  John. I don’t want this to be like quid pro quo."
6507,bartlet,"That’s the carrot. Leo, what’s the stick?"
6509,bartlet,"They put command-control in the field, John, and we’re gonna get physical. You make damn  sure they know that."
6510,bartlet,Talk to the ambassador. I want Fitzwallace to have photos in 24 hours.
6517,toby,"How you feeling, Mr. President?"
6518,bartlet,Much better. Thank you.
6520,bartlet,"You know, I was watching a television program before with a sort of a roving moderator  who spoke to a seated panel of young women who are having some sort of problems with  their boyfriends. Apparently, because the boyfriends have all slept with the girlfriend’s  mothers. Then they brought all the boyfriends out and they fought right there on television.  Toby, tell me, these people don’t vote, do they?"
6521,toby,I wouldn’t think so. No sir.
6522,josh," Excuse me, Mr. President."
6523,bartlet,"What do you need, Josh?"
6524,toby,"I asked Josh to join me here, sir."
6526,toby,The era of big government is over.
6527,bartlet,You want to cut the line?
6528,toby,"I want to change the sentiment. We’re running away from ourselves, and I know we can score  points that way. I was the principle architect in that campaign strategy, right along with  you, Josh. But we’re here now. Tomorrow night, we do an immense thing. We have to say what  we feel. That government, no matter what its failures are in the past, and in times to come,  for that matter, the government can be a place where people come together and where no one  gets left behind. No one... gets left behind, an instrument of... good.   I have no trouble understanding why the line tested well, Josh, but I don’t think  that means we should say it. I think that means we should... change it."
6529,bartlet,"I think so, too.  What do you think, Josh?"
6530,josh,"I’d make it a point never to disagree with Toby when he’s right, Mr. President."
6531,bartlet,Then you and Sam get your people together and get to work.
6532,toby,"Thank you, Mr. President."
6534,josh, You’re jealous ‘cause Danny was flirting with Mandy.
6535,c.j.,I didn’t say that. When did I say that?
6536,josh,I read between the lines.
6543,c.j.,"Carol, is Danny Concannon in the Press Room?"
6544,c.j.,"Would you have him come to my office, please?"
6548,bartlet,You’ve taken it 14 times in the last three hours. You’re not taking it again.
6550,bartlet,At least not with a thermometer.
6552,bartlet,I’m saying if you want to take it recreationally...
6556,bartlet,I stopped asking those questions.
6557,c.j.,So... you have asked me out many times. I have said no.
6558,c.j.,That was a business dinner.
6559,c.j.,"Nonetheless, I do seem to have a preoccupation, um, sort of girlish, I suppose, thing,  which, um... and please don’t be in any way mislead by anything... in fact, let me put  it this way..."
6560,c.j.,"I thought what I’d do is kiss you, you know, on the mouth, then I’d just get past it...  I’d just get past it, and I’ll be able to give my work the kind of concentration it  really deserves."
6562,c.j.,Be careful of the fish. 
6563,c.j.,"No, I’m saying cause if you rock against the..."
6566,c.j.,"Okay, I got to go now. "
6574,bartlet,"Godspeed, your Lordship."
6576,bartlet,"Friends, let me have your attention please. A lot of time, energy, passion, wit, skill,  and talent went into drafting this, and while you might not know it from my delivery  later, this is an extraordinary speech. And I say thee yea! Toby Ziegler, and I say  thee yea! Sam Seaborn!"
6578,bartlet,"Roger, I’m sorry you drew the short straw on this. We’ll miss you tonight. Next year,  it’ll be the surgeon general, I promise. Meanwhile, you can watch TV at my study."
6582,bartlet," “He shall, from time to time, give to the Congress information on the state of  the union and recommend to their consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary  and expedient.”"
6584,bartlet,"Oh, Roger, if anything happened, you know what to do, right?"
6585,bartlet,"First thing always is national security. Get your commanders together. Appoint joint  chiefs. Appoint chairman. Take them to Defcon 4. Have the governor send emergency  delegates to Washington. The assistant attorney general is gonna be the acting A.G.  If he tells you he wants to bring out the National Guard, do what he tells you."
6586,bartlet,You have a best friend?
6587,bartlet,Is he smarter than you?
6588,bartlet,Would you trust him with your life?
6589,bartlet,That’s your chief of staff.
6590,bartlet,"Oh, in the residence, in the second floor, the bathroom at the end of the hall.  You have to jiggle the handle a little."
6591,bartlet,I got to go.  You’ll do fine. People have phenomenal capacity.
6592,c.j.,...weather permitting we'll be in the rose garden. 
6596,c.j.,"This President is from New England and I think it's time we all started getting used  to that. At least, that's what he told me this morning. What else do we have here?  There will be 15 pen recipients. The President will sign the bill with 15 pens, and  I guess someone on my staff wanted you to know that. "
6597,c.j.,Tell me you don't have a question about the pens. 
6600,c.j.,"You know you were the only one in the room doing the math on that, right? "
6602,c.j.," 15 pens, 13 letters, they must have stuck something in here  about... Yes... he's gonna... interesting... he's gonna literally dot the I"" and  cross the ""T""s. "
6604,c.j.,"Jonathon and Jennifer Lydell, the parents of Lowell Lydell, have been added to the  guest list; also added to the guest list are senators... "
6608,c.j.,"I've heard that too, and I don't know where it got started; it's ridiculous. The  President's signing hate crimes legislation, Jonathan and Jennifer Lydell's son was  killed for being gay. They're obviously going to..."
6609,c.j.,The Lydells are coming. 
6611,c.j.,Breach and Larkin. Senators Breach and Larkin will be attending as well. 
6612,c.j.,"Listen, you've been a great audience, don't forget to tip your waitresses. That's all  the news today, you're outta here. "
6616,c.j.,I spoke the mother on the phone. I spoke to her twice! 
6617,c.j.,What's wrong with the father? 
6620,c.j.,Their son was just murdered Mandy! Did you want him to wear a campaign button? 
6621,c.j.,Are you listening to yourself? 
6622,c.j.,You want me to audition the Lydells? 
6624,c.j.,"Carol? Dotting the ""I""s and crossing the ""T""s, thank you for that. "
6625,c.j.,You misspelled senator. 
6627,josh,We've got a bit of a sticky wicket. 
6628,c.j.,Please don't tell me I'm staying here and working late tonight. 
6629,josh,I need you to read a report. 
6630,c.j.,"I'm a woman in her prime, Josh. I'm a prime woman. "
6631,josh,"There's no doubt about it, but I need you to read this anyway. "
6633,josh,"We want Congress to sign off on funds for a hundred thousand new teachers. They say,  fine, but you gotta stipulate that in Sex Ed classes.... "
6636,c.j.,I would no have trouble passing such a class. 
6637,josh,"We commissioned a report about a year ago on Sex Education in public schools, and,  well, this is it. "
6641,josh,It says basically that teaching abstinence only doesn't work- that people are going  to be prone to have sex whether they're cautioned against it or not. 
6642,c.j.,"Well, what are they recommending? "
6643,josh,"Something called ""abstinence plus"". "
6647,josh,"Well, Sam's renamed it 'everything but'. "
6652,c.j.,They want teachers to teach... 
6654,c.j.,And so the sticky wicket joke was...? 
6655,josh,A regrettable pun. Should I order you some food? 
6656,c.j.,"Y'know, I can't remember the last time I got home before midnight. "
6657,josh,"By the way, pages 27 to 33? A couple of things every girl should know. "
6661,c.j.,I have to read a report on Sex Education. 
6662,c.j.,"I'm anticipating any joke you could possibly make right now, and I'm not finding any  of them funny. "
6664,c.j.,I didn't grab you. You grabbed me!
6668,c.j.,How do you know about this? 
6669,c.j.,What kind of White House source? 
6670,c.j.,I'll find out about it. 
6672,c.j.,"Wait.  Okay, you can go now. "
6677,josh,Did they burn the hamburger? 
6682,josh,I like it where if you dropped it on the floor it would break. 
6686,josh,Any stories we have to give the press that we're not wild about we give all in a lump  on Friday. 
6688,josh,Instead of one at a time? 
6690,josh,"They've got X column inches to fill, right? They're gonna fill them no matter what. "
6692,josh,"So if we give them one story, that story's X column inches. "
6694,josh,They're a fifth the size. 
6696,josh,Because no one reads the paper on Saturday. 
6703,toby,Because the Constitution prohibits religious activity in any form connected to Government? 
6709,toby,The student newspaper? 
6711,toby,And why are they talking to us? 
6715,toby,"The President's daughter got an idiot sociology professor, and we gotta... "
6739,toby,"He didn't write the thing, Leo. "
6741,toby,"Well, that horse left the barn! "
6745,josh,"Sam and me, we're meeting with Bruno from an appropriation sub-committee that has  jurisdiction over the White House budget. "
6747,josh,"Technically, it's about me. They want to know why I withheld information gained during  Inspector Javert's drug search... Yeah, it's about you. "
6748,toby,Um... Can I just say a word about that? 
6750,toby,It was absolutely the right thing to do under the circumstances. 
6762,josh,"We'll need to ask Sam, don't you think? "
6766,josh,"Donna needs to talk to us, and it doesn't look good. "
6770,josh,Didn't he used to work for us? 
6774,josh,He's working for Hoynes now? 
6779,josh,"Well, what does this have to do with us? "
6782,toby,You remember Chad Magrudian? 
6784,toby,Yeah. He took a ride... 
6785,c.j.,I know about this already. The round of golf? 
6787,c.j.,Danny got it from a White House source. 
6789,c.j.,Any problem with that? 
6790,toby,As long as it wasn't the other way round. That was a joke! 
6791,c.j.,It better have been. What else? 
6793,toby,"There's going to be a thing with Zoey. Her sociology professor's teaching some things,  and we're going to get her out of class. "
6795,toby,You can dump that out with the trash. 
6797,toby,And I was kidding before. 
6798,c.j.,"I don't leak stories to Danny. If you don't believe me, ask Danny. "
6802,c.j.,Why wouldn't I be okay? 
6804,josh,"Her name is Karen Larsen. She worked on the Vice-President's campaign and in his public  affairs office. Aides thought she was getting a bit of a crush on Hoynes, so they moved  her further away. "
6809,toby,How high is her FBI clearance? 
6811,josh,I think we've found our man. 
6812,toby,"Sam, have a talk with her when you get back from the Hill. "
6815,bartlet,"I don't want to spend the whole day talking about bananas. Good morning Nancy, good  morning Mrs. Landingham. "
6817,bartlet,I really don't want a banana. 
6819,bartlet,I'm done talking to you now. 
6820,bartlet,"Good Morning everyone. Sit down, sit down please. "
6822,bartlet,Are we a poor Latin American country? 
6824,bartlet,Then why am I having this conversation? 
6826,bartlet,I'm in trouble with Chiquita and Dole? 
6830,bartlet,"We have appointed five people to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. Republicans  in the House, as well as an alarming number of Democrats, have been holding up those  appointments. "
6831,toby,I've been fully briefed. 
6832,bartlet,"As far as I can tell, their reluctance has little, if anything, to do with bananas. "
6833,toby,I'm meeting with some key people this afternoon. 
6835,toby,I was raised on Sesame Street. I was raised on Julia Child. I was raised on Brideshead  Revisited. Their legacies are safe in my hands. 
6836,toby, You've got a problem? 
6837,c.j., You watched cooking shows? 
6838,toby,I watched Miss Julia Child. 
6842,bartlet,You're going to sit with them? 
6843,c.j.,When they get in this afternoon. 
6844,bartlet,And talk to the father. 
6846,bartlet,"The mother too, but I'm concerned about the father. "
6847,c.j.,"Sir, if you don't mind me asking, what exactly is the nature of your concern? "
6849,c.j.,I don't understand... His son was just killed. 
6852,bartlet,This is no time to out a guy in front and center who's embarrassed that his son was gay. 
6855,c.j.,Yeah... but his son just died. 
6859,c.j.,"Mr. President, I was wondering if you had an opportunity to look at the Sex Education  report? "
6860,bartlet,I haven't had chance yet. 
6861,c.j.,Because it's very dramatic and I think we should talk about the right form with which  to present it to the public. 
6862,bartlet,Give me a chance to look it over and we'll talk at the end of the day. 
6864,bartlet,"Josh and Sam, wait up a second. Leo, don't go away.  Excuse us a second. Thank you. "
6865,bartlet, What time are you going up to the Hill? 
6867,bartlet,"I want to pre-empt a hearing. I don't want it. I don't want it for Leo. I don't want  it for his family. I don't want it for us. They know that, and they're gonna play ""Let's  Make a Deal."" Don't take anything off the table until you've talked to me. You understand? "
6869,bartlet,"Okay. Unless a war breaks out, I'll be spending much of my day talking about bananas. "
6872,josh,"Thank you, Mr President. "
6873,bartlet,Alright.  Is Simon Blye coming in to meet with  you today? 
6875,bartlet,I broke into your secret schedule compartment and took infrared photos with my compact  camera.  
6877,bartlet,"Margaret told me. Look, why are you meeting with that man? "
6881,bartlet,"In good times, Leo. It's not hard to like a guy when he's doing well. The measure of a  man is, how does he behave when things are otherwise? "
6883,bartlet,"That you couldn't get from me? Or Toby, or Josh, or Sam, or C.J.? "
6887,bartlet,"You put a lot of faith in people, Leo, and I love you for that. I just don't want to  see you get disappointed. "
6898,c.j.,Are we off the record? 
6900,c.j.,Feels like we're still on the record. 
6904,c.j.,There won't be any more kissing. 
6905,c.j.,"Is it possible that a father could be embarrassed about his son being gay, even after  his son was murdered? "
6906,c.j.,"Possible to the extent that he'd be disinclined to support a law that would impose  stiffer penalties upon the perpetrators of hate crimes, including the ones who tied  his 17 year old son to a tree and threw rocks at his head? "
6909,c.j.,I'll have information for you Friday. 
6910,c.j.,"He's a C-level aide to the Vice President, Danny. He's resigning. You want to run a  special section? "
6911,c.j.,A job you're uniquely suited for. 
6913,c.j.,"Okay, you should go now. "
6914,c.j.,"Yes, then... I should go. "
6924,josh,"We were in the midst of announcing our nominee for the Supreme Court, so there was a  certain amount of... "
6928,josh,There's a first clients. 
6930,josh,Under the Freedom of Information Act. 
6948,josh,You want the White House to keep it in a drawer for a year? 
6950,josh,We put this thing in a drawer for a year and you can guarantee us... 
6952,josh,Leo McGarry hasn't done anything wrong. Neither has anyone else. The hearings aren't going  to turn up anything. We're not frightened enough to suppress... 
6953,toby,It's not television for rich people. 
6954,toby,"It's not television for rich people. In fact, the public television audience is a fairly  accurate reflection of the social and economic make up of the United States. , which is one percent better than the commercial TV audience.  So what are you talking to me about? "
6956,c.j.,Why don't you get Mandy? 
6957,c.j.,She's in the Oval Office having what must be a very comfortable conversation with the  President. 
6958,bartlet,"""By the age of 14, more than 25 percent have touched a girl's..."" I won't say that word.   "
6964,bartlet,Because I'd rather not be in therapy for the rest of my life. 
6966,c.j.,I'm C.J. Cregg. And you've already met Mandy? 
6967,c.j.,"Please sit.  We want to thank you for coming such a long way, particularly  so soon after this unspeakable tragedy. "
6968,c.j.,"Mrs. Lydell, that's why we asked to talk to you for a minute. It was Mandy's impression -  and perhaps it was mistaken - that you and your husband... uh... have some reservations  about appearing in support of the President. I hate to have to put it so bluntly, but is  that true? "
6970,c.j.,"I'm sorry. I was asking... Mr. Lydell, I don't know how else to put this. But if you  appear in front of the press to be at all embarrassed about your son's homosexuality...  I guess... let me just say this, do you support the President? "
6974,c.j.,"So, the press surrounds them. He says what he says. "
6975,c.j.,"He made a reasonable point. And maybe, given the circumstances, he's got a right. "
6977,c.j.,They said they support the bill. 
6978,c.j., What else... I'm saying... 
6979,c.j., Yeah. All right. All right. I know. I know. 
6982,toby,Because people want to claim they're more sophisticated than they are. 
6985,toby," It's Fozzy Bear, not Fuzzy Bear. "
6986,toby,It's a perfectly reasonable complaint. 
6988,toby,"We're gonna see to all those things. In the meantime, a time when the public is rightly  concerned about the impact of sex and violence on TV this administration is gonna protect  the muppets, we're gonna protect Wall-street Week, we're gonna protect Live from Lincoln  Center and by god, we are going to protect Julia Childs."
6990,c.j.,I got a message you wanted to see me? 
6993,toby,"Josh and Sam cut a deal on the hill. No hearing for Leo, he's gonna be out of the woods. "
6994,c.j.,"Oh Toby, that's, that's great. "
6995,toby,I gotta get back in there. This is just too much fun. 
7010,bartlet,You're not going to believe this but I think I'd actually like a banana. 
7013,bartlet,"Thank you, Mrs. Landingham. "
7014,bartlet,She withholds food from me. 
7015,c.j.,"Mr. President, I hate to keep jumping up and down on this, but... "
7018,bartlet,We're gonna leave it alone for a while. 
7020,bartlet, After the midterm elections. 
7021,c.j.,That's a year from now. 
7023,c.j.,We're gonna stick it in a drawer? 
7024,bartlet,It's a pretty incendiary report. 
7025,c.j.,You don't think we have an obligation to present the information? 
7026,bartlet," It's not gonna play well at a PTA meeting, C.J.  It says we should be teaching kids to have sex. "
7027,c.j.,"It does not, Mr. President, excuse me sir, but it does not. "
7028,bartlet,Of course it doesn't. But that's how it's going to play. 
7029,c.j.,"The report is very direct, sir, it says with holding knowledge about having sex doesn't  prevent teenagers from having sex, it prevents teenagers from having sex safely. And it  says offering information about safe sex doesn't increase the rate of sex, it increases  the rate of protected sex. "
7031,c.j.,"We commissioned this report, Mr. President. These people are doctors; we asked them a  question. How can we put it in a drawer just cause we don't think people are going to  like the answer? "
7032,bartlet,"C.J., getting it through this congress, a body which at the moment, will only give federal  funding to sex education programs that teach abstinence only. "
7033,c.j.,We have an enormous pulpit from which... 
7034,bartlet, And we will avail ourselves of that pulpit but we will do it after  the midterm elections. 
7035,c.j., I think I understand. 
7036,bartlet,"I needed to get Leo off the hook, C.J. "
7037,c.j.,It's the deal Josh and Sam made. 
7038,bartlet,Yes. We'll deal with it after the midterm elections. 
7040,bartlet, I was hoping you would. 
7041,c.j.,"Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Umm, several members of the press already know, I think, the report  came back to us and... "
7042,bartlet,"Yeah. Well there's nothing wrong with telling them we got it. I wouldn't make a big deal  out of it. We got it, we're looking at it, we're studying it. Throw it out with the trash. "
7045,c.j.,Thank you sir.   Mr. President? We could all be better teachers. 
7049,c.j., I was... uh.... nothing. 
7051,c.j.,If you call Mr. and Mrs. Lydell in St. Paul and ask them why... 
7054,c.j.,There all stories this week. 
7055,c.j.,Four other press secretaries and you never took a free lead? 
7058,c.j., What makes you think I'll like you now? 
7061,c.j., Cause we've gotten very good at this. 
7082,josh,"I’m seeing Sam, and then I’m out of here."
7088,josh,I can drink with the best of them.
7090,josh,"I’m in politics, okay. I can drink."
7092,josh,I wish you’d stop telling people that. It makes me sound like an idiot.
7094,josh,"And this is the first time in a long time I’ve had the opportunity to spend the weekend  doing anything but working, is my point."
7100,josh,There aren’t going to be strippers there. Men don’t like that anymore.
7102,josh,"No, we still like naked women a lot. It’s looking at them in a room full of your best  friends that makes you feel a little..."
7107,josh,I’m out of here. What do you need? 
7120,josh,Aren’t you going sailing tomorrow?
7122,josh,"Then how are you gonna...  Oh, come on!"
7126,josh,I was planning on doing nothing.
7130,josh,What am I supposed to tell him?
7134,josh,I don’t think so. What else you got?
7138,josh,We have to be here at 10:00 tomorrow morning.
7140,josh,‘Cause you work for me.
7146,josh,Ten minutes. When it’s over I’ll buy you some shoes. 
7149,josh,"Sam, just stay in the boat this time and I’m a happy guy."
7236,josh,No. Just since a couple of hours ago.
7242,josh,"I couldn’t find my keys, or remember where I lived. "
7244,josh,I think there might have been strippers there. 
7247,josh,I may have wrinkled my suit.
7249,josh,Donna. You... You really want to speak very softly.
7251,josh,People were pouring champagne over each other.
7253,josh,"I can’t remember, but it’s certainly not out of the question."
7255,josh,"Yeah, I know. I’m not, you know. Uh... what was the meeting again?"
7263,josh,They’re the only clothes I got.
7267,josh, I’m not even listening to you now.
7269,josh,Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.
7271,c.j.,"Don’t start with me, Mr. President."
7272,bartlet,I was helping pass the time. I was being entertaining as well as instructive.
7273,c.j.,"I’m back in America now, I have rights. I’m no longer belted down next to the passenger  from hell."
7275,bartlet,Leo! What’re you doing here?
7279,c.j.,"-- gruesome. “If you’ll look out the left side of the cabin, you’ll see the fjords.”  Then we got a history of the fjords. Then we got a quiz on the fjords.   Do you have any idea how much I would like to dress you up in lederhosen  and drop kick you into the fjords right now?"
7280,bartlet,Aww. You don’t know how to have fun when we’re traveling...
7291,josh,What time is this person coming?
7295,josh,He’s getting here in forty minutes.
7301,josh,I’ll look like the Gorton’s fisherman in this thing. 
7305,toby,"Sam, I’m at temple right now."
7309,toby," Yeah, he is. How did you know that?"
7311,toby,Why am I coming over there?
7313,toby,"All right, I’m on my way."
7314,josh, What is God’s name is happening right now?
7316,josh,"Help me, ‘cause I... I don’t..."
7317,josh,"Ah.  Ah, okay. I’m Josh Lyman."
7320,josh,You’re O’Dwyer’s campaign manager? 
7322,josh," I was... I uh... I... I spilt some things on my clothes. Tell  you what, let’s... let’s just take a deep breath for a second while I try and remember,  you know, where I am right now."
7323,josh,I have a very delicate system.
7327,josh," This is my assistant, Donna Moss. Donna, Joey Lucas."
7329,josh,I’m just going to go... I... I... I’m... I’m gonna go change my clothes. I’ll... I’ll be  right back. 
7332,josh,You have any idea how dumb I looked in there?
7342,josh,What are you talking about?
7344,josh," Oh, man. Make sure they’re going to be okay in there. This might take a  few minutes."
7345,toby,Are you saying my rabbi wrote a sermon just for me? 
7347,toby,How did he know what was going on here?
7349,toby,One of the public defenders spoke to my rabbi?
7351,toby,How did he know where I go to temple? How did he know I even go to temple?
7352,josh, I thought they were sending it back to the sixth circuit.
7356,josh,Are we getting a briefing from Justice?
7363,josh,"Possibly.  Hey, why aren’t you sailing right now?"
7368,josh,"No, Bert Lincoln. Mandy, what are you-?"
7369,josh,I don’t want a debate on the death penalty. Let’s get some stuff together and get ready for the President.
7370,josh,"I gotta get back to...  Oh... By the way, Sam. Joey Lucas is waiting  for me in my office right now."
7372,josh,"Well, for a campaign manager, he’s got very nice legs."
7374,josh,Yes. He is. He’s also deaf. And very pissed. Be right back. 
7381,toby,How did the public defender know I was at that temple?
7383,toby,How did he know where I was going to be?
7387,toby,"Sam, what’re you doing giving out that kind of information-"
7389,toby,"He’s not going to commute the sentence, Sam."
7391,toby,It seemed like what you should do?
7395,bartlet,We got to get Mendoza on the bench.
7397,bartlet,Why is it my problem at all?
7399,bartlet,The governor of Michigan.
7403,bartlet,Which allows for the death penalty in certain drug related homicides.
7407,bartlet,"Okay, I’ll wait for that then."
7409,bartlet,I’m gonna want to see our people over the next few days.
7411,bartlet,"I’m not going to be very good at this, Leo."
7417,bartlet,"Charlie, there’s a priest in Hanover. His name is Thomas Cavanaugh. He’s at the  Immaculate Heart of Mary. I’d like to arrange to have him come down and spend some  time with me this weekend. Very important that the White House not pay for this. This  is my nickel."
7418,bartlet,And I’m gonna want to... 
7419,bartlet,"No. No, never mind.  Yeah. I’m gonna want to talk to the Pope."
7421,bartlet," I’m gonna ask you a question. And this is one of  those times that it’s okay to tell me I’ve stepped over the line, and I should shut  my mouth, okay. "
7422,bartlet,What happened to the guy who shot your mother?
7423,bartlet,"If they did, would you wanna see him executed? "
7424,bartlet,Killing a police officer’s a capital crime. I figured you must have thought about it.
7428,josh,Because you have a chance to beat him.
7429,josh,We’ve been watching your campaign. You’re doing way too well.
7430,josh,He’s a preposterous figure. We want to keep him right where he is.
7431,josh,"Joey, every time he comes out with one of his declarations about brown people crossing  the border, the DNC slaps it into a direct mail campaign, and he’s good for two or  three million dollars."
7433,josh,The President doesn’t take meetings on this level. I don’t even take meetings on  this level!
7435,josh,"I’m not hearing a lot of party loyalty from you here, Joey."
7437,josh," Hey, Lunatic Lady! Trust me when I tell you that there’s absolutely no way  that you are going to see the President!"
7439,josh,"Hello, Mr. President. Welcome back."
7441,josh,"Well, I’d like this day to be over pretty bad."
7443,josh,"Uh, this is Joey Lucas."
7446,josh, And this is Kenny... somebody.
7448,josh,We were just finishing up.
7449,bartlet,I was just wandering the halls and thinking.
7450,josh,"Why don’t you let me show these people off and, uh, I can wander the halls with you."
7451,bartlet, You ever seen the White House?
7456,c.j.,Carol. Good. I need biographical information on Simon Cruz.
7458,c.j.,Gonna need to know how to spell his name for sure. 
7461,bartlet,Is that short for Joanne?
7462,bartlet,And your last name is Lucas?
7465,bartlet,"Well, this is the Oval Office. Come in, please. Sit down. "
7466,bartlet,"Well, where did you go to school?"
7467,bartlet,There’s a guy named Simon Cruz on death row. He’s going to be executed in about 36  hours. What do you think I should do? 
7469,bartlet,He was found guilty of a double murder and drug trafficking.
7470,bartlet,You’re against capital punishment.
7471,bartlet,Did you study St. Augustine at Stanford?
7473,bartlet,"Two pretty smart guys, right?"
7474,bartlet,"They believed in that part of the Old Testament which said, “Who sheddeth a man’s  blood by man shall his blood be shed.”"
7475,bartlet,I’ve got a Harris poll says seventy-one percent of the American people support capital  punishment.
7477,josh,"Thank you, Mr. President. We should... "
7478,bartlet,In the California forty-sixth?
7479,bartlet,O’Dwyer’s an empty shirt.
7480,bartlet,"I don’t like guys who run for congress because they think it’s a great gig. Find  yourself a live one and I’ll get interested. In the meantime, the devil you know  beats the devil you don’t. And I like the devil I got."
7481,bartlet,Josh will take care of you from here.
7483,josh, You didn’t have a good time meeting me?
7484,josh,"You know what, I actually know that sign. "
7485,josh,"Don’t know that one, but I can probably guess."
7487,toby,"Yeah, well, I had to go back to my office and I think you know why."
7490,toby,I never imagined the practicing.
7491,toby,Rabbi. You - and Bobby Zane - what were you expecting of me when you gave your sermon  yesterday?
7492,toby,"As Communications Director, uh, I’m a counselor to the President to be sure. But my  role in these situations is generally... I create a public face for what... I don’t  influence policy."
7493,toby,"You want me to go into the Oval Office and say, “Vengeance is not Jewish”?"
7494,toby,"Well, for one thing, neither is the President!"
7495,toby,"Look, I... I spent the day..."
7496,toby,You’re damn right. I did.
7497,toby,"Congratulations, Rabbi Glassman, you may now join the White House communications staff."
7498,toby,"Yeah, well, you’re welcome.  The Torah doesn’t prohibit capital punishment."
7499,toby,"It says, “An eye for an eye.”"
7500,toby,You know what I think? I think you knew I was coming back here. And I think you put her  there on purpose. 
7505,c.j.,I have his biographical information. His mother’s name is Sophia. Sophia.
7507,c.j.,"You know, I have no position on capital punishment. I try to get worked up about it,  it seems like I should. But the truth is, I honestly don’t care if Simon Cruz lives  or dies. And I suppose if it brings some measure of comfort to the families of the  victims, then why the hell not."
7508,c.j.,"So, here’s my job tonight. If this thing happens.  “At 12:01, he’ll get the injection...”"
7509,c.j.,"No, I’m saying, I’m reading it, right here. “The first sign of death will be his hands  twitching. After sixty seconds, he’ll strain against the straps, his head will have  snapped back violently, and after ninety seconds he’ll be in convulsions. At 12:04,  he’ll be pronounced dead.”"
7510,c.j.,"Me neither. That’s what I’m saying, me neither. Except... at 12:04, ‘cause that’s when  the warden calls me. That’s my job tonight. I have to go in and tell the President that  Simon Cruz is dead and we’re the ones who killed him. So...   I just wish I didn’t know his mother’s name was Sophia, is all I’m saying. "
7512,toby," Good afternoon, sir. Welcome back. "
7515,bartlet,Fine. What do you need?
7516,toby,"I had a strange experience this weekend. One of the P.D.s on the Cruz case, I guess  trying the things you do when you’re desperate, he went and spoke to my rabbi."
7517,bartlet,Jewish law doesn’t prohibit...
7519,bartlet,"The commandment does not say, “Thou shalt not kill.” It says, “Thou shalt not murder.”"
7520,toby,"I know. But the fact is that, even two thousand years ago, the rabbis of the Talmud  couldn’t...  ...stomach it. I mean, they weren’t about  to rewrite the Torah, but they came up with another way. They came up with legal  restrictions, which make our criminal justice system look... They made it impossible  for the state... to punish someone by killing them. "
7521,bartlet,"We make it very hard to kill anybody in this country, Toby."
7522,toby,It should be impossible.
7528,toby,"Yeah. Thank you, Mr. President. "
7532,bartlet,"I commute this guy, for no particular reason other than I don’t like the death penalty..."
7534,bartlet,And the next President sees it in a different way. I’ve laid track to all kinds of...  The next guy is gonna have eighth amendment problems up the ass.
7536,bartlet,We cannot execute some people and not execute others depending on the mood of the Oval  Office. It’s cruel and unusual. 
7538,bartlet,"Okay. Give me a minute please, Nancy. "
7564,josh, Thank you for meeting me.
7565,josh,Aren’t you impressed that I was able to track you down?
7566,josh,It was very hard. I had to have my assistant call your office in California. 
7567,josh,"It’s funny, when I say it out loud like that, it doesn’t sound that impressive."
7568,josh," No, I came at the request of the President. He wanted you to know  that he felt that he was rude to you in the Oval Office yesterday. He apologizes  if he was abrupt about your problem and while the tightening of your funding was  political strategy on our part, he honestly feels that your candidate is a schmuck  who gives liberalism a bad name."
7569,josh, I know you do. Why are you working for him?
7570,josh,I’d imagine. He also wanted me to tell you that he meant what he said. Come up with  a live one and we’ll get interested in a hurry. 
7571,josh,"As a matter of fact, he did."
7573,josh,You guys have a nice flight back. 
7578,bartlet,Thanks for coming all this way down.
7579,bartlet,"Yeah, it seems like a wasted trip."
7581,bartlet,You’re looking at the room.
7582,bartlet,We don’t use the red phone anymore.
7583,bartlet,I tell Mrs. Landingham I want to talk to the Kremlin. Would you like a drink?
7584,bartlet,"To be honest, I prefer Mr. President."
7585,bartlet,"You understand why, right?"
7587,bartlet,There are certain decisions I have to make while I’m in this room. Do I send troops  into harm’s way? Which fatal disease gets the most research money?
7588,bartlet,It’s helpful in those situations not to think of yourself as the man but as the office.
7589,bartlet,I want you to know that I had a number of people on my staff search for a reason the  public would find palatable to commute the sentence. A technicality. Any evidence of  racism.
7591,bartlet,"I’m the leader of a democracy, Tom. Seventy-one percent of the people support capital  punishment. People have spoken. The courts have spoken."
7593,bartlet," Oh, for crying out loud, Tom. I open my mouth and say, “Somebody get me the Pope.”"
7594,bartlet,"Anyway. I looked for a way out, I really did."
7597,bartlet,"I did, Tom. I know it’s hard to believe, but I prayed for wisdom."
7598,bartlet, It never has. And I’m a little pissed off about that. 
7602,bartlet,"Bless me, Father, for I have sinned..."
7603,josh,What’re you talking about?
7611,josh,He’s arrested for drunk driving.
7613,josh,How much does the press know?
7615,josh,The cops haven’t leaked it?
7617,josh,They don’t know that they’ve arrested Roberto Mendoza?
7619,josh,I’ve got this thing now.
7621,josh,"Stay ahead of the pace, Sam, and have Toby page me. We don’t even know if this guy’s  called a lawyer. Is he sitting in a jail cell right now? "
7622,josh,Thank you. Thank you very much.
7623,josh,Thanks David. Good to see you.
7628,c.j.,Was the President’s nominee for the Supreme Court just arrested for drunk driving?
7630,c.j.,"Then it’s pretty bad, isn’t it?"
7632,c.j.,I thought he doesn’t drink.
7636,c.j.,Then what was he pulled over for?
7639,toby, I stepped off the edge of the world.
7643,c.j.,Why’d he refuse the Breathalyzer?
7644,toby,‘Cause he’s a crazy man who’s out to ruin my life. 
7646,toby,That’s what he’s out to do. Has anyone posted bail? 
7651,c.j.,"It’s not Cook County, Toby. It’s Friday night in Wesley, Connecticut."
7652,toby,"Believe me when I tell you this, C.J. I will figure out a way to blame this on you."
7653,c.j.,I have no doubt about that.
7655,c.j.,Toby’s got you covered there.
7658,toby,The judge and I are gonna have an abrupt conversation. 
7660,josh,"Well, the first thing I’ll tell you is, there’s no such thing. "
7661,josh,"I-I’ll give you an example from this week. In fact, the story I’m about to tell you  all happened within the last 36 hours. Anyone who’s been reading the papers in the  last few days has probably been following along with what we call the news cycle  that wouldn’t end. Depending on how you look at it, it started either with a cabinet  secretary losing her temper, a committee chairman baiting her during a hearing, the  President answering a question he shouldn’t have, a dentist appointment, or me being  stupid.  One thing’s for sure, it  started out as a day that was supposed to trumpet the President’s vision for  educational reform."
7663,c.j.,I understand this stuff.
7668,toby,Give him the bullet points.
7669,c.j.,"I feel bathed in your confidence as well, Toby."
7670,c.j.,Forgive student loans to people who become teachers --
7672,c.j.,"-- and spend at least three years teaching in a rural or inner-city school. Give cash  bonuses to people who leave other careers to become teachers and provide federal money  for grants to individual school districts to use older, more experienced teachers to  train younger, less experienced teachers."
7673,toby,Should note that half of all new teachers quit in the first three years.
7674,c.j.,"It’s right here on my index card, Toby. "
7688,c.j.,"Carol, let’s move the briefing to one."
7690,c.j.,"Yes, and this is a perfect excuse to postpone the thing."
7692,c.j.,I have a dentist appointment at noon.
7695,c.j.,I’m experiencing some pain.
7697,c.j.,"About a month now, but it’ll go away by itself."
7705,c.j.,When’d you start talking like this?
7709,toby,She called him a racist?
7710,josh,She didn’t use that word.
7712,josh,"Well, yes, she used that word."
7714,toby,I want anything that might be on the wire already about the HUD Secretary calling Jack  Wooden a racist.
7715,toby,"No, Bonnie, I want it at whatever leisurely pace you two feel..."
7716,toby,"I want it now.  On C-SPAN, she called him a racist?"
7717,josh,"Nah, not just Wooden. She was pretty careful to include all Republicans. "
7718,toby,Why are you good humored about this?
7721,josh,She was baited and she was right.
7726,toby,"“Of course not,” she answered wisely?"
7727,toby,"Well, wasn’t that clever of her? "
7728,josh,"Donald Morales, who is the spokesman for the Department of Housing and Urban Development,  and who was wishing he hadn’t gotten out of bed that morning, confirms what happened.  Now there’s the matter of telling the President."
7730,toby,"Gets a little bit worse, actually."
7731,bartlet," “When reporters confronted Secretary O’Leary in a hallway outside the hearing  room, she defended...” Oh come on!"
7735,josh,She’ll be here in half an hour.
7736,bartlet,Yeah.  “If the shoe fits.” Is that the best she could do? 
7738,josh,"The President spoke briefly.  But, he spoke. He signed the bill. He gave away the pens. Then he took  a few questions from the press. Now, before I go on, it should be pointed out that  according to every poll conducted in the universe, the issue that concerns Americans  more than any other is education. Now, The President has just signed off on $700,000,000  in new money for education and announced a plan of aggressive education initiative.  What do you suppose the first question from the press was?"
7739,bartlet,"Let me say that I have great confidence in Deborah O’Leary. She’s done a terrific job  at HUD, helping thousands of people make the very difficult transition from joblessness  and homelessness to more fulfilling and productive lives."
7740,bartlet,"I was hoping you weren’t going to notice that, Danny."
7741,bartlet,"Then I will tell you that I agree the Republican Party does not have a comprehensive  program for combating poverty in this country. That being said, there are countless  Republicans who are working very hard to change their party’s legacy on some of these  issues. And I hope to be working with them to do just that."
7742,josh,"If only we’d stopped it right there. If only we’d said, uh, “Sorry, The President  can’t take any questions right now,” or, uh, “We’ll cover this in a briefing,” or,  “The building is on fire!”  But for some reason, it took us all a  moment to realize that there was no Press Secretary in the room."
7743,bartlet,"Frankly, I think she went too far in assigning motive to Congressman Wooden and the  Republican Party."
7744,bartlet,She’ll be meeting with Leo McGarry.
7745,bartlet,An apology’d be appropriate.
7749,bartlet, That went pretty well.
7753,toby,The U.N. ambassador is in Portugal.
7755,josh,Eight words. “The President’s not taking any questions right now.” If we’d just stepped  in 30 seconds sooner. 
7762,toby,You’re from Connecticut. What exit do we want for Wesley?
7766,josh,"Toby, I’m kind of in the middle of something here."
7769,josh,Call me when you know something.   Sorry about that.
7770,josh,"The, uh, trade deficit. Where was I?"
7771,josh,The day would’ve gone a lot differently. The President had said that Secretary O’Leary  should apologize. The press wanted to know if she would be fired if she didn’t and we  didn’t have an answer. She was coming up to the White House for a showdown. This was  what the day was about now. And the day was about to get worse...because I was about  to step to the plate. 
7772,toby,We’re going the wrong way.
7774,toby,We’re supposed to be going east.
7776,toby,How do you know we’re going east?
7782,toby,"Hey, Galileo, get off at the next exit and turn the car around."
7783,josh,"Secretary O’Leary was told that Leo McGarry wanted to see her as soon as possible.  There was no question that she was going to be angry about the President publicly  asking her to apologize, but at the moment, that was Leo’s problem."
7805,josh,"So that should’ve been it, right? C.J. Cregg does the two o’clock briefing, tells them  Secretary O’Leary has an apology for Congressman Wooden. All questions on the matter will  be handled by her spokesperson, Donald Morales, and redirects their attention to the 700  million bucks of yours that we just spent on teachers.   Who here has had emergency root canal? "
7808,josh,What the hell happened?
7810,josh,What happened to your cheeks?
7812,josh,Why are you talking like that?
7814,josh,"Yeah, I heard you the first time, I was just amusing myself."
7815,c.j.,I can suggest some othew things you can do wiff yourseff.
7817,josh,"You’re gonna need to stop saying that, ‘cause you just look and sound so ridiculous. "
7818,c.j.,I have to cancew the bwiefing.
7819,josh,You can’t cancel the briefing.
7822,c.j.,I can’t do the bwiefing.
7824,c.j.,I can’t even say “bwiefing.”
7825,josh,"You can’t cancel the briefing, C.J. You got to wrap up O’Leary, you got to move them back  to the bill signing."
7827,josh,"Sorry, did... did you just say my name?"
7828,c.j.,You weally think I can do it?
7829,josh,"Don’t be insane, C.J. You’re not going to a press briefing looking like Bullwinkle."
7830,c.j.,"Oh, so once again you’we just hawing a wittle fun! "
7833,josh,When can you take the cotton out?
7834,c.j.,Two houws. I’w have Cawow cancew the bwiefing.
7835,josh,"No, we’re still doing it."
7841,c.j.,Howstiwe. Howstiwe. You get howstiwe!
7842,josh,"I don’t get hostile! I don’t get randomly hostile, I get hostile when hostility’s  called for."
7844,josh,Sam went to Foggy Bottom.
7845,c.j.,What’s he doing in Fwoggy Bowtew?
7846,josh, I just wanted to see if I could make you say “Foggy Bottom.” Sam’s working with  the speechwriters.
7848,josh,Toby’s with Leo and the President.
7850,josh, Hey there cats and kittens. This is Josh Lyman  coming at you with your two o’clock briefing!
7851,c.j.,"Josh, pwease be vewy cawefuw. Twy vewy, vewy hawd not to destwoy us."
7852,josh,"You shouldn’t say that C.J., you’ve got a great body... Here we go. Woo!"
7855,josh,I talk to reporters all the time.
7856,josh,"Let me tell you something, mi compadre. You guys have been coddled. I’m not your  girlfriend, I’m not your camp counselor, and I’m not you sixth grade teacher you  had a crush on. I’m a graduate of Harvard and Yale and I believe that my powers of  debate can rise to meet the Socratic wonder that is the White House Press Corps.  "
7857,josh,"I’d like to say a couple things in my own defense. First of all, everything was fine.  I dispensed of the Deborah O’Leary matter with ease and poise. I opened the room up to  questions while imposing a discipline I felt had been lacking in C.J.’s briefings."
7858,josh,I’m gonna take one question a piece.
7860,josh,"Mike, you sure you want your one question to be that stupid?"
7862,josh,The President quit smoking years ago.
7864,josh,"Well, then, uh... Jonathan."
7865,josh,I’ll look into it. Danny?
7866,josh,Let me emphasize the President is pleased that unemployment has dropped another point five  percent as a result...
7867,josh,"The President will do everything in his power to maintain the robust economy that has  created millions of new jobs, improved productivity and kept a lid on inflation."
7868,josh,"Twenty-four PhD’s and a Counsel of Economy Advisors, Katie. They have a plan to fight  inflation."
7869,josh," Yeah, Danny. We have a secret inflation plan."
7871,josh,I guess that’s pretty much when the wheels came off the wagon.
7875,toby,Sam feels we’re zeroing in on it.
7876,josh,You haven’t found it yet?
7877,toby,"We’ve been navigating by the North Star, which turned out to be the Delta shuttle from  LaGuardia. It’s a miracle we’re not in Nantucket right now. "
7878,josh,"Toby, how hard can it be to find the Wesley police station?"
7879,toby,"I don’t know, Josh, but while we’re looking, can you tell me a little more about the  President’s secret plan to fight inflation?"
7880,josh,How long until you let up on me on that?
7881,toby,"Oh, it’s gonna take a little while I would think."
7882,josh,Call me when you know something. 
7884,toby,"Or you could just pull in there,  at the Wesley police station and ask them."
7890,toby,Let’s get this done and get outta here.
7901,josh,"Danny Concannon had thrown me a knuckle ball in the dirt, which I’d taken a big swing at  and - just like that - the President had a secret plan to fight inflation."
7902,josh,There is no secret plan!
7903,josh, I was talking to Danny. I was kidding! 
7904,josh, I honestly can’t remember the question.
7910,josh," This’d be a great time to feel a little support from you, Donna!"
7914,josh,"Okay, good, that’s a start. Tell me what you think I should do right now."
7918,josh,"Yeah, that’s the face I wanted to see right now."
7919,c.j.,What the heww happened in thewe?
7920,c.j.,You compwetewy impwoded!
7923,josh,I wouldn’t say completely.
7924,c.j.,"You wewe vague, you wewe howstiwe, you wewe bewwigewant!"
7926,c.j.,You know what it’s gonna take fow me to fix this? 
7928,c.j.,"No, you’we not. You awe not evew awwowed in my pwess woom again!"
7929,josh,"Donna, call up Toby’s office and see if he was watching."
7931,josh,Never mind.  Support me on this.
7934,toby,Have you fallen on your head?
7936,toby,Have you fallen down and hit your head on something hard?
7937,josh,I feel really bad about this.
7940,toby," Oh, well then I guess that’s all that really matters."
7942,toby,"That was some very good television, Josh, and I think four network news directors will  bear me out on that tonight. "
7943,josh,I really think this isn’t as bad as you’re making it out to be.
7944,c.j.,A secwet pwan to fight infwation!
7945,toby,"Okay, C.J., for a little while you’re gonna have to write it down."
7954,toby,"Believe me, Sam, the only thing that could make my day worse is if Roberto Mendoza got  involved."
7955,josh,"Roberto Mendoza is the President’s nominee to fill Crouch’s seat on the Supreme Court.  The President put Toby Ziegler in charge of his confirmation, which is a huge  responsibility. A failed confirmation for the Court is a body blow to a presidency.  Besides which, he’s a brilliant jurist and we badly want him on the bench. The  confirmation process is a tough needle to thread. You gotta make a lot of friends and  Supreme Court nominees don’t speak before their confirmation, they let the White House  speak for them. Something Toby’s had a little bit of trouble teaching Roberto Mendoza."
7957,c.j.,He said the Pwesident was wong to make Secwetawy O’Weawy apowogize-
7972,josh,"They have telephones in Nova Scotia, Leo. It’s not Amish country."
7975,c.j.,The Pwesident needs to be bwiefed on the events of the day.
7976,toby,"C.J., so help me if you use the words “Pwesident” or “bwiefed” again."
7980,josh,A lot of this is our fault. And the President probably isn’t going to take this very well  and we just want you to know that we will be there with you in spirit tomorrow morning.
7983,josh,"If you read the papers, you know that this not the first time this had happened. In  the eight weeks since the President named his nominee, Judge Mendoza has, on various  occasions, publicly criticized the American Bar Association, the AFL-CIO, and the New  York state legislature. Three organizations without which this President would not  have been elected. Putting out the Deborah O’Leary fire from earlier in the day had  been the only thing we’d been successful at, and now Judge Mendoza had... "
7989,toby,Hello Mr. Justice. How are you?
7990,toby,No. Judge and I are gonna have a chat. 
7991,josh,"The hardest job in the White House is President. The second hardest job is not Chief  of Staff, it’s not National Security Advisor, and it’s not Press Secretary, although  I’m gaining a certain amount of respect for Press Secretaries. The second hardest job  in the White House belongs to a 21 year old kid named Charlie Young. He’s what’s called  the President’s body man, his personal aide. He’s with the President morning to night.  He has a range of responsibilities, all of them difficult. But the one he hates most in  this from time to time it is his job to wake the President up in the morning. And on  this particular morning, the President had gone to sleep only three hours earlier."
7993,bartlet,What could you possibly want right now?
7995,bartlet,"I mean, what in the name of everything holy could you want right now?"
7997,bartlet,And what could you possibly want?
8000,josh,"Mendoza was summoned to the White House from his vacation in Nova Scotia. When you  summon someone to the White House, you generally expect to see them within the hour.  Judge Mendoza told us that he would see us in three days. Why three days? Because he  was driving down to D.C., stopping in Connecticut to do some antiquing. Yet another  thing we’d have to tell the President. Who, by the way, had still not woken up."
8001,bartlet," Charlie, are you aware you’re committing  a federal crime right now?"
8002,bartlet,"How did you know the First Lady wasn’t going to be naked when you came in here?   Come to think of it, where the hell is my wife?"
8007,c.j.,"Well, the swelling’s gone down. On the other hand, the painkillers have worn off."
8012,toby,"Something really kinda freakish about you, you know that?"
8013,bartlet,"I’m tired, I’m cranky, and my wife’s in Argentina. Let’s get this over with."
8018,bartlet,What kind of incidents?
8020,josh,"Yeah?  Oh. First, I’m happy to tell you that the incident involving Secretary  O’Leary and Congressman Wooden has been dispensed with. Though not really, and I’ll get  to that at the end. Sam asked C.J. to move the briefing to two o’clock so that we could  fold in the teachers. C.J. had emergency root canal surgery at noon and so was unable  to brief."
8024,josh,"Yeah. A long story short, you’re gonna be reading a bit today about your secret plan  to fight inflation."
8025,bartlet,I have a secret plan to fight inflation?
8027,bartlet,Why am I gonna be reading that I do?
8028,josh,It was suggested in the Press Room that you did.
8031,bartlet,You told the press I have a secret plan to fight inflation?
8032,josh,"No, I did not. Let me be absolutely clear, I did not do that. Except, yes, I did that."
8033,bartlet,"Josh, I’m a little confused."
8034,josh,"Sir, there was this idiotic round robin. It was sarcastic. There’s no way they didn’t  know that. They were just mad at me for imposing discipline and calling them stupid!"
8035,bartlet,"Okay, before we go on. C.J., if blood is gushing from the head wound you just received  from a stampeding herd of bison, you’ll do the press briefing."
8038,bartlet,A secret plan to fight inflation?
8039,josh,There was no turning them back. I denied it for half an hour. They wouldn’t take no  for an answer.
8041,josh,"I was crystal clear. They said, “Do you think if the President has a plan to fight  inflation, it’s right that be keep it a secret?” I said, “Of course not!”"
8042,bartlet,"Are you telling me that not only did you invent a secret plan to fight inflation, but  now you don’t support it?"
8043,josh, When you put it like that...
8044,toby,"Mr. President, much as we’d love nothing more than to stand here and watch you beat  the living crap outta Josh, there’s actually a bigger fish to fry."
8046,toby,He told the Chicago Tribune that you were wrong to admonish Secretary O’Leary and  make her apologize.
8049,bartlet,You said you were gonna fix it.
8051,bartlet,"It’s broken again, Leo."
8052,toby,"Frankly sir, that’s ‘cause your nominee for the Supreme Court’s handling himself in a  manner that’s totally unprofessional."
8053,bartlet,"We will have the first of what I think will a series of discussions about professionalism  another time, Toby. Where is Mendoza?"
8059,bartlet,Is he coming in from Neptune?
8062,bartlet,"Okay. We will wait for Mendoza. In the meantime, C.J., you will untangle the Press Corps."
8064,bartlet,And we will hope that nothing happens today to make this any worse. Although I certainly  wouldn’t bet the house on it. That is all.
8066,josh,"Sir, I wanna tell you that I’m sorry and that this mess will be cleaned up in an adult  and professional manner."
8068,josh," If anyone asks you, you quit smoking years ago, and the cigarette you bummed  on Air Force One was for a friend."
8073,josh,"Actually, he’s on his way right now. He’s spending the night in Connecticut to do some  antiquing."
8077,toby,Why didn’t you take a Breathalyzer?
8079,toby,So you give Barney Fife a hard time to make a point. 
8081,toby,"One phone call, Judge. “Toby, this has happened. Tell ‘em my name’s Roberto Mendoza  and the President’s named me to the bench!”"
8086,toby,"Judge, due respect. Get your things and let’s go. "
8087,toby,He’s also seen you wearing a robe with a gavel in your hand.
8088,toby,"Robbie and Laura, where are they right now?"
8089,toby,"There’s nothing about this that doesn’t stink. If it were me, I’d wanna extract  vengeance, and I’d say “Let justice be done.” I’d also wanna spend some time in a  dark room alone, so that I didn’t have to face my wife and my son and have them see  my humiliation. Rob, I can’t get this done if this is the story. Can’t get it done.  Nothing about this that doesn’t stink. And nothing about it that wouldn’t be better  if you were a Supreme Court Justice. Let me take you to the motel. Go see your boy."
8092,toby, You got personal items?
8093,toby,"Your lucky night, officers. There isn’t gonna be a report, there isn’t going to be  an investigation, no one’s getting suspended. And no one’s filing a hundred million  dollar lawsuit against the county that they would almost surely win. But in this room,  you’re gonna apologize to Mr. Mendoza. And then you’re gonna get in your squad car and  you’re gonna follow us and you’re gonna apologize to his son."
8098,toby,"Killing me, Judge. You’re absolutely killing me."
8102,josh,Good.   That’s the last time the phone will ring. I promise.
8103,josh,"There’s a part of the story I didn’t tell you. I can’t. Trust me, it doesn’t involve...  I-I-I just can’t right now. Ask me back again after the Senate confirms Mendoza.  You really should hear it, it’s a good story."
8105,bartlet,I don't like putting him in this position.
8107,bartlet,I just don't want you to think that I'm getting any pleasure in putting him in this  position.
8111,bartlet,I mean it's ironic that it all comes down to a vote on the ethanol tax credit.
8115,bartlet,Are you being brusque with me?
8117,bartlet,I'm just saying you can't blame me. It's what you get from having an even number  of senators.
8119,bartlet,That's what I usually do.
8121,bartlet," Ron, am I going to meet her on the plane?"
8122,bartlet, Zoey got a new agent on her detail.
8124,bartlet,Have you seen these new agents?
8126,bartlet,"They've got the hair, the backpacks, the clothes. Walking around campus strapped to a  44 magnum."
8128,bartlet,"Let me tell you something, when it's your kid, you don't want them blending in. You  want them wearing a sign that says, ""I'm carrying a loaded gun, and the safety's off."""
8136,bartlet,I want to come home after the fundraiser.
8140,bartlet,"Your impersonation of my mother is getting sharper and sharper, you know that?"
8143,bartlet,I'll see you tomorrow. 
8144,bartlet,C.J.! Charlie! My flying companions!
8145,c.j.,"Good morning, Mr. President."
8149,c.j.,"No, Mr. President, I wouldn't say they were."
8151,c.j.,"Well, they're not wild about taking off at 3 0'clock in the morning, sir."
8152,bartlet,"Oh, it's going to be great. We're going to race the sun to the pacific horizon!"
8153,c.j.,"I'll be sure to tell them that, sir. I'm sure it'll pick them right up."
8154,bartlet,"Morning, Everyone. Sam, it's going to be 50-50 on the ethanol tax credit."
8156,bartlet,"Make all the calls you want, it's going to be 50-50."
8157,toby,"Sir, Josh and I would at least like the opportunity to talk about the Al Kiefer  meeting."
8158,bartlet,You two are so freaked out about this Al Kiefer meeting.
8160,bartlet,"We'll listen to him, Josh."
8162,bartlet,"You two want to see the best part about having my job?   Colonel, this is the president. I'm ready to go."
8165,c.j.,Have you tried the Lancome high-protection sunstick for face and lips?
8167,c.j.,Plus the Elizabeth Arden modern skin care daily moisturizer.
8168,toby,The two of you understand that we're going to be in California for one day?
8169,c.j.,There's tanning time between 2 and 4.
8172,josh,Cameron’s going to introduce a bill tomorrow.
8175,c.j.,It's Cameron. Who cares?
8176,josh,I have a feeling Ted Marcus might care.
8179,toby,"You've been in the air all night, you don't know anything, you'll get back to him."
8181,c.j.,"Plus, it's Cameron. So, who cares?"
8182,josh,Marcus is going to care.
8183,c.j.,Thank you.  This man has got to be stopped!
8186,bartlet," I'm sorry we haven't had a chance to meet before now. You've been with  Zoey's detail, what?"
8190,bartlet,You were a Mountaineer.
8192,bartlet,"So, you were commissioned a second lieutenant?"
8194,bartlet,How long have you trained for this assignment?
8195,bartlet,"What, were you the first one to sign up?"
8197,bartlet,"You know Zoey's dating my body man, Charlie Young, right?"
8198,bartlet,You know about the letters?
8199,bartlet,Are they white supremacists?
8200,bartlet,"You don't have an artist's sketch, or psychological profiles, or anything?"
8202,bartlet,"Okay. Zoey's 19 and she wants to be a teenager. She wants a college experience, and  I can't blame her. I loved college. So did my other daughters. I want Zoey to be  comfortable with her protection, I don't want her to try and give you the slip. It's  not your job to tell me she wants to cut English Lit, it's not your job to tell me if  she's dying her hair blue, or going to a strip club, or whatever it is she's doing  with her friends. You know what your job is."
8205,bartlet,"If she's cutting English Lit, I want to know about it."
8221,c.j.,"You guys? Everyone? Sorry, but we're landing in a few minutes, and I just wanted to brief  everyone on the President's schedule. The President will be greeted at the airport by  Congressmen Hark and Jennsen, the Mayor and various City Council Members. It's photos  only, no formal remarks. We will depart the airport at 6:20 and head for the hotel, at  which point I predict that we will no longer be on schedule. "
8227,josh,"I've spent half the nights in my life in hotel rooms, and I still cannot... "
8229,josh,Later. You sure this isn't for your room? 
8233,josh,"Later. You know, there used to be keys... "
8235,josh,"You stuck it in, you turned it, you... "
8236,josh,I loosened it for you. 
8246,josh,She's here in this hotel. 
8256,josh,"Well, that's something I really care about. "
8260,josh,Interpreting the classics with Poet Laureate Donnatella Moss. 
8264,josh,"Yeah. Let's do it. Call her, and then we'll do everyone else. "
8270,josh,Hang on.  I'd better call him first. 
8271,josh,Good morning. You beat me to the door. 
8273,josh,This is a beautiful house. 
8274,josh,I've been on a plane all night. 
8275,josh,"Seriously, Studio Chairman -- nice work if you can get it. "
8276,josh,What do you want to talk about? 
8277,josh,"Ted, I checked into my hotel room 15 minutes ago, what did you haul my ass out here for? "
8278,josh,Cameron's bill is a joke.
8279,josh,"It's the House. It's procedure. Do you know how many bills get introduced every day that  never get a hearing, let alone a vote? "
8281,josh,"I came to you because you told me to, now I've got a cab waiting outside... "
8283,josh,You're worried about nothing. I'll see you later. The President's looking forward to  the party this evening. 
8285,josh,"You're a rotten bluffer, Ted. "
8286,josh,You're not going to cancel the fundraiser. 
8287,josh,This is the President. 
8289,josh,That was abrupt. I apologize. 
8290,josh,You can't cancel the fundraiser. 
8291,josh,This is ridiculous. You're going to be a joke to our people. 
8293,josh,"Ted, no one is going to pass a bill banning gays in the military. And if the House ever  passed such a bill, if the Senate every passed such a bill, the President would never  sign such a bill. "
8295,josh,"So, you're not going to flake on me. "
8296,josh,"So, the party's still on? "
8299,josh,"That's not going to happen, and you know it. "
8313,josh,I just came from Ted Marcus's. 
8315,josh,He's threatening to cancel tonight unless the President comes out publicly against 973. 
8317,toby,It's not going anywhere. 
8320,josh,"He takes it seriously for obvious reasons, and he is distressed by the President's silence  on the subject, and he feels that it's a betrayal of the gay community for him to be so  publicly supportive of the President. "
8321,toby,All right. It is not in the interest of his cause for the President to make a public  statement today. It'll give credibility and attention... 
8324,toby,"And, should the President choose to stay in his hotel room tonight and not kowtow to the  Hollywood blah, blah, blah, it will only serve to solidify his public reputation with the  electorate as a man of character. "
8326,toby,"Use those words, and tell him if he goes ahead with the party, he gets 10 minutes alone  in a room with the President. "
8327,josh,"All right, I can sell that. "
8329,josh,How's he doing in there? 
8331,bartlet,"I'm sorry. I've actually been told that I have to go now. This is a debate that is  obviously going to continue in town halls, city halls, state legislatures, and the U.S.  House of Representatives. There is a population in this country that seems to focus so  much time and energy into this conversation, so much so that I am forced to ask this  question -- is there an epidemic of flag burning going on that I'm not aware of? "
8332,bartlet,"I mean it, man, is there an emergency-level outbreak of flag desecration no one's kept  me posted on? "
8333,toby,"There is not, so let's blow off the Kiefer meeting. "
8334,bartlet,"Toby, there is no reason for you to feel threatened by Al Kiefer. "
8336,bartlet,Excellent. Because we're doing it over lunch. 
8337,josh,I have to eat with Al Kiefer? 
8340,bartlet,"Better, yet, Charlie, where is Zoey having lunch? "
8342,bartlet,"That supposed to be a good place, Sam? "
8344,bartlet,Is that an L.A. experience? 
8345,bartlet,"Well, there aren't going to be any people today. "
8346,bartlet,"Sounds like fun, doesn't it? "
8347,bartlet,"Yeah, but the hotel wouldn't make the guacamole right in front of me. "
8348,josh,"Sir, I need a minute to talk about Ted Marcus. "
8349,bartlet,We can do it in the car. Who's talking to Leo? 
8351,bartlet,"You come in the car, too. "
8352,toby,"Sir, this lunch with Al Kiefer? "
8353,bartlet, Those people over there don't like me too much. 
8354,josh,"Well, they just haven't taken the time to get to know you like we have, sir. "
8355,bartlet,"You would honestly think there was an epidemic of flag burning going on, endangering  countless lives in this country. "
8356,toby,Don't put too much stock in what he has to say. 
8357,bartlet,"I'm having lunch with my daughter, Toby. You guys are going to sit with Kiefer, and  let me know what's worth listening to. "
8360,toby,"What, I'm not coming in the car? "
8361,bartlet,"No, and you know why? Because you made fun of the guacamole. "
8363,bartlet,I could tell you were thinking it. 
8366,bartlet,"Surprised you for lunch, I know, I'm the best. "
8368,bartlet,"Yeah, but on the other hand, the guy made guacamole right in front of us. "
8369,bartlet,This is father/daughter fun time. 
8370,bartlet,"Oh, you know, I hadn't thought about that.  Now that you mention it, yeah,  I think you're right. "
8371,bartlet,"All kinds of things in California, Zoey. You've got your smog, your freeway shootings,  brush fires, mudslides. Plus, apparently, there's a mad rash of flag burning going on,  and you don't want a piece of that. "
8372,bartlet,"Right there, right in front of me, they made the guacamole. Now, how about that? "
8375,c.j.,People respect a President who stands by the courage of his convictions. 
8377,toby,You just said that we couldn't. 
8380,bartlet,"C.J., has Al said something that I should listen to, yet? "
8381,c.j.,"We'll let you know, sir. "
8383,josh,Why do you encourage him? 
8385,josh,We've heard these numbers before. 
8386,bartlet,"Yeah, but I never get tired of hearing them, you know. Especially in front of my  daughter. "
8389,toby,I just figured out who you were.
8390,toby,No. You're the guy that runs into 7-Eleven to get Satan a pack of cigarettes. 
8395,bartlet,Men with pools and patios think I'm weak. 
8396,josh,I don't want to mention the 49 times we asked you not to take this meeting. 
8397,bartlet,Was that Marcus on the phone? 
8398,josh,"Speaking of natives, we sold him on 10 minutes in a room alone with you, tonight. "
8399,bartlet,No way I can get out of it? 
8401,bartlet,"I used to like parties, you know that? "
8404,c.j.,"I mean, look at this house! "
8406,c.j.,"You know, you haven't said anything about my dress. "
8408,c.j.,You're not even looking. 
8409,toby,I'm looking at the house. 
8412,toby,"Throw in a box of chocolates and a pair of nylons, get you a lot more than that. "
8414,toby,"I'll be over at the bar, drinking a lot, if anyone wants me. "
8421,c.j.,You know what? You want Toby or Sam. I'm not a writer. 
8422,c.j.,"Well, I certainly can't direct or act. "
8424,c.j.,"I thought a guy writes a movie, and a guy directs a movie. "
8425,c.j.,And in between there are designers and technicians and actors. 
8426,c.j.,"So, tell me what I do again? "
8427,c.j.,"Okay. Well, at the moment I have a pretty good job and I understand what it is, so,  uh, I sure appreciate...  Pretend you're talking to me. "
8439,josh,You're frightening the guests. 
8446,josh,"I got your phone message this morning, but I've been kind of running around. I didn't  see you until now. "
8447,josh,"Well, then you should have said hello to me. "
8448,josh,"I can assure you, I was not. "
8450,josh,"Hello!  Look, uh, we're just here for the day... "
8452,josh,"Uh, yeah.  Can you not, uh, not, uh, just don't leave the party, okay? "
8461,bartlet,"We're running out of reasons not to fire him, Leo. "
8463,bartlet,"I can ask for his resignation, and don't be a smart ass. "
8472,bartlet,"All right, let's do what Sam said. "
8474,bartlet,"I'm not done with Hoynes, but dump it. "
8476,bartlet,"I'll call him from the plane.  Christ, will this damn day never end? "
8478,c.j.,"Nice to meet you, too. Jay, can I talk to you for a second? "
8479,c.j.,"Uh, Jay, the President appreciates your laying off Leo McGarry the past few months.  It hasn't gone unnoticed. "
8480,c.j.,"Well, if there's anything I can do for you... "
8481,c.j., How does she  look like that? 
8483,c.j., Just pretend that you're talking to me again. 
8490,josh,"So, you want to know what we did for lunch today? "
8491,josh,We had a meeting with a democratic pollster who told us that we could sew up  reelection if the President led the charge in favor a flag burning amendment. 
8493,josh, Seriously... this guy had some pretty scary numbers. 
8494,c.j.,"Josh, I think I just made a three-picture deal. "
8495,josh,Three-picture deal doing what? 
8496,c.j.,It doesn't seem to matter. 
8497,josh,This is Joey Lucas. This is her assistant Kenny. 
8502,josh,I was just telling her about Kiefer's numbers. 
8504,toby,"Please, please say that you did. "
8505,toby,That depends on the California numbers. 
8506,toby,You're looking very good to me right now. 
8509,josh, Do you have any idea how big you scored with Toby and Sam right now? 
8511,josh,"""The voice of the people is the voice of a dog""? "
8514,josh,"Okay, um. I should go. I have to go. "
8515,josh,Absolutely. I will call in advance of my coming. 
8517,bartlet,"It's not going to pass, Ted. It's not going to get voted on. "
8518,bartlet,"And I'm saying as a gesture, as a symbol, you make that public demand, Ted, and you're  going to be Cameron's best friend. "
8519,bartlet,"Oh, God, Ted! Give me the name of one person who's complaining to you, and I'll call  them personally and tell them I will never sign a law like that. "
8521,bartlet, Don't you ever slap  Josh Lyman around again. That guy is the White House Deputy Chief of Staff. He's not  one of your associate producers. 
8522,bartlet,"Don't screw around with me now, Ted. I'm really not in the mood. "
8523,bartlet,"Right now, right this second, the worst thing that could possibly happen to gay rights  in this country is for me to put that thing on the debating table, which is happens  the minute I open my mouth. Do you get that? I'm a human starting gun, Ted. You got  to trust me! I know what I'm doing. "
8527,bartlet,"Imagine how tired I'm going to look when you see me a couple of months from now.   I haven't slept well, lately. Kept everyone up on the plane as we flew out.  You know, we left at 3 in the morning? I really want to try to sleep on the way back. "
8531,josh,She said she was with somebody. 
8533,josh,"Donna, she's with somebody! "
8535,josh,Why would she just be saying that? 
8539,josh,It's one in the morning. 
8541,josh,I'm not going to knock on her door at one in the morning. 
8545,josh,"Donna, I am not going to knock on her door"
8546,josh,"Were you just clucking like a chicken, is that what that was?"
8548,josh,"I couldn't knock on her door if I wanted to, I don't have her room number."
8551,josh,"Okay, first of all, don't do that thing anymore with the phone message! Phone message!"
8553,josh,"Tell them I'll be down in one minute. Wait, how's she going to know I'm knocking on  the door?"
8555,josh, Tell them I'll be there in a minute.
8557,josh,You know I got the wrong room.
8559,josh,"No! I'm not. I-I-I was just stopping to say a quick goodbye, don't bother."
8560,josh,"I wanted to say a quick goodbye. We’re taking off. And, uh, thank you for talking to  us tonight. That was helpful."
8563,bartlet," Anyway, Mr. Vice President, it's taken care of, we can put it to rest."
8566,bartlet,"I want to tell you, a couple of years ago in Iowa, I really admired the way you hung  in there on the ethanol tax credit. You went out to Iowa and said the same things  you'd been saying in the Senate for eight years, event though you knew it wasn't going  to play. My confession is, you and I agree on ethanol, but you were the only one to  say it. You stood in there even though you knew you were going to lose Iowa and who  knows what after that. Anyway, I just wanted to say you had a good day today, John."
8567,bartlet,I'm going to try to go to sleep now.
8599,bartlet, Is here going to be a coup? 
8600,bartlet,Is there going to be a coup? 
8601,bartlet,And this is on page.... 
8604,bartlet,Yeah?   Leo... Intelligence briefing. 
8606,bartlet,There are mornings I'm just nodding my head. That can't be good for anybody. 
8612,bartlet,I'll say. Who knows so far? 
8616,bartlet, The market is going to open 200 points down. 
8618,bartlet,When was the last time we were lucky? 
8620,bartlet,It's going to be 300...350. 
8626,bartlet,I'm not saying I'm not sure it's Ehrlich. 
8628,bartlet,I'm saying I'm not sure. It's the Fed Chairman. Give me a day. 
8632,bartlet,Wall Street needs to trust me. 
8634,bartlet,A day. I'll tell you something else. You could have been nicer to me during this  conversation. 
8636,bartlet,By saying that Wall Street does trust me and the market will hold until I appoint  a new Fed Chairman. 
8642,bartlet,I'm not ready to jump into bed with Ron Ehrlich yet. I'm one of the few people in my  family who can say that. 
8644,bartlet,So...  That's was page 17? 
8652,josh,"Donna, the fact that I'm on hold right now this shouldn't be your cue to tell  me what like was like 100 years ago. "
8657,josh,I'm actually back on the phone now. 
8660,josh,I'm gonna go to my meeting now. But you sit here and keeping talking. It'll be like  I never left. 
8668,josh,What were they driving? 
8672,josh, When do you have time to read these books?!? 
8674,josh,I notice you're able to do it right here at the office. 
8679,toby,C.J. gonna need a reason why the President's waiting a day that doesn't sound like  we're reconsidering Ehrlich. 
8683,toby, The man just died... out of respect for his memory... his family... 
8686,toby,Okay that didn't seem to be about anything that interests me. 
8688,toby,It's his fifth heart attack Sam. He was 138 years old. 
8690,toby,"Sam, look at yourself. How much healthier do you want to be? "
8695,toby,"We are waiting a day to make our announcement out of respect, Josh. "
8699,toby,And how I wish I were one of them. 
8700,josh,Now...You're gonna love this meeting! 
8705,toby, It's locked down with some 15 votes to spare. 
8706,josh,There is value for having these three Congressmen on board. 
8708,josh,A... A clear and public demonstration that the President's liberal base hasn't  turned their backs. 
8709,toby," In the case of these three people, I'd like to see a clear and public  demonstration that they've turned their backs and run as far as humanly possible. "
8710,josh,I think you think it's beneath you to ask. 
8711,toby, We've got the trade bill. It's sewn up! And it's as bipartisan as we're  likely to see. There was a victory and we're the victors. And I'm not going in there  hat in my hands. 
8712,josh,No one's asking you too. 
8713,toby, You're asking me too! 
8714,josh,"No, we're gonna do good cop, bad cop. "
8717,toby,"Cause this isn't an episode of Hawaii 5-0. How about you be the good cop, I'll  be the cop who didn't go to the meeting. "
8718,josh,You have to go to the meeting. I told them you would be at the meeting. If you're  not there they're gonna start right out insulted. 
8719,toby,I go to this meeting there's a decent chance we end this meeting with them insulted.  So... 
8721,toby,I need to exercise more. 
8723,toby,I gotta exercise more. I gotta eat better. 
8724,josh,"Toby, you're gonna sit in that room and you're gonna behave yourself. I swear  to God, you are gonna sit there while I court these peoples votes and every  so often you're gonna smile so as to indicate warmth. "
8725,toby,"I can still kick the crap outta you, though. We're clear on that, right? "
8727,toby,Then what the heck are we waiting for? 
8730,josh,The President's very serious about this. 
8732,josh,"So you've told him many times but here these people are. So, I guess the President  disagrees with you... Given that... "
8733,toby,I understand. Let's go. 
8734,josh,So you're just gonna sit there. 
8736,josh,If you open your mouth it will be to say something nice. 
8744,josh,Nice to see you. Thanks for coming. 
8746,c.j.,He is shocked and saddened by the death of his colleague. For over 11 years  Bernard Dahl oversaw the largest economic expansion in the country's history  and I can assure you he will be.... 
8748,c.j.,There are a number of very good candidates.
8749,c.j.,"I want to be clear, no such list exists. Obviously from his post as the number  two man at the Federal Reserve, Ron Ehrlich is a candidate."
8750,c.j.,Sidney Bloom is a candidate. 
8751,c.j.,Mr. Ottenberg is a candidate. 
8752,c.j., I'm aware of no such declaration. 
8753,c.j.,I don't know who the unnamed people are. But I suppose it's possible on a social  occasion... 
8754,c.j.,We're hoping to have it done tomorrow. 
8756,c.j.,Get me a copy of the wire report? 
8757,c.j.,Could I have sounded any stupider saying respect? 
8762,c.j.,I got a question about Mrs. Bartlet stating her preference for Ron Ehrlich. 
8764,c.j.,It's in a wire piece that's on my desk. 
8782,bartlet,Without regard to the validity of past arguments. 
8784,bartlet,Yes and I'm saying that condition doesn't exist anymore.
8786,bartlet,"Historically, American prosperity has been built the broad growth in the GDP  of 5% of greater. And now with the deflationary pressures of the Global Economy,  that kind of growth can be achieved without the negative side affects of rampant  inflation.  Do you understand what I'm saying?"
8788,c.j.,I understand the  I really don't understand anything. 
8789,bartlet,My point is Ron Ehrlich might not be the guy. I'm saying it's not a mortal lock. 
8790,c.j.,"So let me suggest, Mr. President, that I talk to the First Lady and ask her to clarify... "
8792,c.j.,...that her position... 
8794,c.j.,"""My husband will choose the best man for the Fed...."" "
8796,c.j.,"..."" I support whatever..."" Sir! "
8797,bartlet,"C.J., we don't handle my wife. When we try, do you know what happens at the other  end of this building?  "
8798,c.j.,You get a little punishment. 
8799,bartlet,I get a little punishment. Screw it. Let's move on. It's not a big deal.  
8803,bartlet,"Yeah, Leo says I can do that. It's gonna be Phyllis who has never liked me.  It's gonna be Susan who thinks I'm xenophobic because I don't like Mexican food.  These are my wife's friends. "
8804,bartlet,Yes.  They're still angry at me 'cause  I accidentally ran them over with my car. 
8805,bartlet,"Thank you, Mrs. Landingham. "
8808,c.j.,"Thank you, Mr. President. "
8810,bartlet,I'll tell you what else; historically 2 to 2 ½ GDP expansion is classified  lack luster even anemic economic growth.  Four ½ to 5% is needed just to be considered robust and not even spectacular. 
8812,bartlet,Sometimes I'm just making it up. 
8822,bartlet,How about math. Why aren't you taking math? 
8823,bartlet,"Wiseass all you want, but you're coming of age in the 21st century. A century  in which I promise you mathematics is going to play a starring role. On the  other hand I would definitely put my shoulder into Intro to Cinema. Intro to  Cinema's what got me where I am today. "
8824,bartlet,That was going to be a big part of my day. 
8825,bartlet,I met with Butterfield and some Secret Service Agents this morning. 
8826,bartlet,You didn't do anything. They think you should be taking more math. 
8827,bartlet,It's time for me to tell you about some letters we've been getting. 
8828,bartlet, Yeah. They don't like that the daughter of the President is dating a young  black man. 
8829,bartlet,"Zoey, please don't tell me you're dating more than one guy. "
8831,bartlet,Cause one guy for you is actually one more than I'm comfortable with.
8832,bartlet,I could see it's had a real impact on you. 
8833,bartlet,No worse than any of the stuff they intercept. 
8834,bartlet,Yeah. Why did Butterfield and the guys meet with me? Apparently there's National  Convention of some sort in Virginia. It was in the papers yesterday that you  and Charlie are going to some club opening this weekend. 
8835,bartlet,"You don't have to cancel, but you can't bring Charlie. "
8836,bartlet,You want me to tell him? 
8837,bartlet,You gotta tell him he truth Zoey. Don't make something up. 
8838,bartlet,You sure you don't want me to come? 
8842,bartlet,I never really new him that well. 
8843,bartlet,I don't know. You want the job? 
8844,bartlet,Can't have it. Know why? 
8846,josh,"We don't. We like lower tariffs. Lower tariffs on everything from Indian textiles,  to German cars to Chilean wines negotiated by our trade reps in Geneva with  130 other countries over the past 7 years. Global Free Trade Markets Access  Act now has cleared the President and we're very proud it's finally ready to  be voted on by the House. "
8847,toby, Where it will win by the way by some 15 votes. 
8849,toby,Anyone eating that donut? 
8850,josh," Now, what happens when you lower the  cost of something, Economists of every stripe, including the one in the Oval Office,  say you that you get a more efficient allotment of economic resources. Now that may  not sound like much to you and me but to an Economist that's a week in St. Barts."
8851,toby,You're concerned about American labor and manufacturing?
8852,toby,What kind of car do you drive? 
8854,josh,What Toby meant to say is we don't get to see you guys often... and it's a  crying shame. 
8855,josh," Uh, think about what you'd like to eat for lunch. "
8856,toby, Also think about that we won and we're here still courting  your vote for reasons passing understanding. 
8858,josh,This... right here. This is why you have a reputation as a pain in the ass. 
8859,toby,I've cultivated that reputation. 
8860,josh,Could I get you to try harder in there? 
8861,toby,"Sure, cause right now I'm not trying at all. "
8862,c.j.,"Guys, I'm standing here. I don't know if you've.... "
8864,c.j.,The wire has a piece. It'll be picked up. 'Sources close to the First Lady say that  she'... 
8868,c.j.,I don't know. Sam spoke to Lilly. She doesn't know a thing about it. 
8871,toby,Mrs. Bartlet should slide in and step in the back door. 'Ron Ehrlich is an old  friend but she supports whatever'... 
8872,c.j.,Yeah. She's not going to unless someone tells her to. 
8873,toby," Well, that sounds an awful lot like your job, C.J. "
8874,c.j.,"Well, I was just in there and he doesn't want me to handle the First Lady. "
8875,josh,Did he say he didn't want you to 'handle the First lady cause he didn't want you to'  or did he say it like 'handle the First Lady but I'm not the one who told you to?' 
8876,c.j.,That's what I don't know. 
8877,josh,You gotta learn the signs. 
8878,c.j.,I've got most of the signs. 
8879,josh,You don't have that one! 
8880,c.j.,I'm learning that one. 
8883,toby,Page Sam and tell him I want him to talk to Lilly again. 
8884,c.j.,What if the President meant it? 
8885,toby, We're not handling Mrs. Bartlet. We're talking to her staff. Page Sam. 
8886,c.j.,I know most of the signs. 
8888,josh,So what would you have done if the guy told you he drove and American car?
8889,toby,Find some other way of humiliating him. 
8890,josh,"You like winning, don't you? "
8891,toby,Saves you from having to say the word please. 
8928,c.j.,I don't have time to talk to you now. 
8933,c.j.,I need you for a second first. 
8935,c.j.,I mentioned the wire piece to the President. 
8937,c.j.,He said he doesn't want the First Lady handled. 
8940,c.j.,I don't have that sign. 
8942,c.j.,I've got most all of them. 
8944,c.j.,Toby thinks if you talk to Lilly Mays again... 
8946,c.j.,Staffer to Staffer. Gently nudge her in that direction. 
8948,c.j.,They're still in their meeting. 
8954,toby,I can deny it. Range Rover inspired Ford to design the Explorer. Which is the best  selling vehicle in its class and Ford's most successful model in years. 
8955,josh,Will you excuse us for a moment? 
8957,josh,"I have to say if there's been improvement in your attitude, it's marginal. "
8958,toby,"We're in hour number four, you understand. "
8961,toby,I thought you were at the gym. 
8973,josh,This is why we fast tracked it! 
8975,toby,She was serious? This wasn't one of her funny jokes? 
8979,toby,What the hell goes on at that gym? 
8981,josh,Somebody's' got to talk to Mrs. Bartlet. Tell her to get Becky Reeseman to back off. 
8982,toby, I refuse to relay these instructions. 
8983,josh,I'll talk to Lilly Mays. 
8987,toby,Press upon her the following: It's taken 7 years to get the bill this far. It's  locked down. Add this amendment and now I've got to go back in there and be nice  to these people! 
8988,josh," Bring this one home, Sam. "
9032,bartlet," We note with surprise your lack of conviction, Leo. "
9034,bartlet,"I miss our late night talks, Danny. "
9035,bartlet," Out there in the campaign trail.... Ames, Iowa...Tulsa... Skokie,  Center City, Tallahassee, Albany...San Antonio, Jasper, Wyoming. "
9037,bartlet,You covered the First Lady as well. 
9038,bartlet,You literally wrote the book on my wife. 
9039,bartlet,Once again I want to emphasize the strong personal bond we built on the campaign... 
9041,bartlet, ...in a... proper...  gentlemanly... 
9045,bartlet,You must save me from having this conversation with my wife. 
9046,bartlet,Or at least make it seem like I'm better armed than I evidently am. 
9049,bartlet,"Welcome to the club, Danny. We had some jackets made. "
9051,bartlet," I'm not kidding...a personal  bond here, Danny."
9052,bartlet," You're coaching my Personal Aide on how to best score with my daughter?  Yes, Danny, that does make me feel better. "
9056,josh,The Hundred Years ago thing? 
9058,josh,Why would anyone want to diminish a woman's sexual desires? 
9073,bartlet,The rhythm of the sewing machine petals? 
9085,bartlet,"Well, your Chief of Staff is a very attractive woman. Maybe he was, you know... "
9087,bartlet,"Abbey, I told C.J. specifically... "
9091,bartlet,She didn't get the signal wrong. I wanted her to send someone. 
9093,bartlet,"This wire thing is a problem for me. The kid on TV was a mistake. And the amendment,  from Becky Reeseman... "
9095,bartlet,...will bring down a trade bill that's been worked on for years. 
9099,bartlet,I staffed it out to C.J.. 
9104,bartlet," Then don't play me, Abbey! Don't work me! A lot of people  around here think it was Lilly Mays, who planted you have a preference for Ron Erlich! "
9106,bartlet, I know it wasn't Lilly Mays. It was you! 
9110,bartlet," Well you put me in a bit of a spot there, Abigail. I name Ron Erlich now,  which I was going to do anyway, and it makes me look like I'm taking instructions  from my wife! "
9112,bartlet,Are you talking about you or me? 
9114,bartlet," I'll walk up to the hill right now, and I will give the Speaker of  the House my resignation. "
9116,bartlet, Do you want to see me get on the phone and put it in session?! 
9118,bartlet," It was nine months, Abbey. Not six months. And I waited a day on Skippy,  because the fed chair is a fairly important position, and I wanted to make damn  sure my decision was right. "
9120,bartlet,How the hell do you know? 
9126,bartlet,On that point I concede the high ground. 
9130,bartlet,"No, no however. Just be wrong. Just stand there in your wrongness and be wrong, and  get used to it. "
9140,bartlet,Okay.  We just had our first Oval Office fight. 
9142,bartlet,Did you talk to Zoey today?  
9144,bartlet,"Maybe she'll be so traumatized by this experience, that she'll never date another  boy again. "
9146,bartlet,"Don't finish that sentence, I'm a man of questionable health.   The Michigan women are waiting for me. "
9148,toby,Put it down! Put it down! Put it down!
9150,toby,"Put it down. Everyone in this room let me have your attention, please. The law of our  land mandates that Presidential appointees be confirmed by a majority of the Senate.  A majority being half plus one for a total of what, Ginger?"
9151,toby,"51 yea votes is what we see on the screen before a drop of wine is swallowed! Because  there's a little thing called what, Bonnie?"
9152,toby,"“Tempting fate” is what it's called.  In the three months this man has been on my radar screen, I have aged 48 years. This is  my day of jubilee and I will not have it screwed up by what, Bonnie?"
9153,toby,"By tempting fate! These things take patience. These things take skill. These things take  luck. In the 15 months we've been in office, what kind of luck have we had, Ginger?"
9155,toby,We've had very bad luck.  Where's Josh?
9159,josh,What's this message about I've got to talk to Mandy about a banana bar? Is that what  this says?
9167,josh,"All right, you know what would be helpful? If you could just show me where one word  ends and the next one begins."
9169,josh,She wants to talk to me about a panda bear?
9171,josh,You're sure you got the message right?
9175,josh,"A panda’s what I think it is, right?"
9177,josh,"Little Australian thing, eats bark off a koala tree?"
9179,josh,The panda's the other one...
9181,josh,"You know, for someone who hasn't quite mastered the alphabet..."
9183,josh,"Your penmanship is illegible. Hey, Mal."
9184,josh,He's going to be watching the Mendoza vote.
9193,josh,How about some champagne?
9223,josh,I don't understand. Salvador Dali had distinctive penmanship?
9225,josh,How was it distinctive?
9230,josh,I can't even begin to tell you how you're not.
9242,josh,I mean... was there a thing? 
9246,josh,Cause of a thing he wrote on a dust cover?
9250,josh,I'm not the guy for this.
9253,josh,C.J.'s going to do “The Jackal.” 
9257,josh,Toby's better for this. Look at the job he did on the Mendoza confirmation.
9261,josh,I'm a white guy from Connecticut.
9263,josh,"I'm saying, isn't this kind of a delicate subject for me to get into with a black civil  rights lawyer from Athens, Georgia?"
9265,josh,Then he's sure to love me.
9285,c.j.,"“He was fat black cat cool like a Friday afternoon martini, chillin’ at a quarter  after five. Twist of lime. Coke on the side. The brother loved the high life. Had a  PhD in Street Strife. They called him the Jackal... The Jackal.”"
9286,josh,There's a little speed bump with Jeff Breckenridge. Leo gave it to me because he thinks  you're burned out after Mendoza. I said I thought that was ridiculous. What do you think?
9287,toby, Are you talking to me... during “The Jackal?”
9289,toby,Never talk to me during “The Jackal.”
9291,c.j.,“He was big Mack daddy super black stylin’ a diamonds in the back Cadillac. Fur lined  boards. White walled wheels. Cruise control. Built for speed. Chrome on everything.  And the stereophonic speakers. But he really didn't need them. When they called him...  The Jackal.”
9304,c.j.,"“Fly boy was in the buttermilk hard. Livin' fast. Livin' large. Six foot four and not  an ounce of fat. When women ask, ""Is you a proud cat?"" He'd say, ""Oh, dear. I'm more  than that. I'm the roanest of the roan. And in case you hadn't known... They call me  The Jackal. The Jackal... The Jackal.”"
9305,c.j.,What are you doing here so late?
9308,c.j.,You have a police scanner?
9309,c.j.,"Danny, you were like, President of your high school audio-visual club, weren't you?"
9311,c.j.,You should have gotten here earlier.
9313,c.j.,Is there any chance David Arbor is not the son of Bob Arbor?
9314,c.j.,"One, there's one other thing?"
9316,c.j.,"Well, at least I know what I'll be doing when I come into work tomorrow. "
9317,c.j.,Make sure you remind my office.
9319,c.j.,Do this... I'm honestly not sure the President even knows.
9320,c.j.,"Yeah, you know why? Because it's such a non-story it hasn't come up yet today. Say it now."
9321,c.j.,The kid's father's a major Democratic fundraiser.
9322,c.j.,The President’s daughter was at a party where there was a drug bust.
9323,c.j.,Has the President had any reaction at all?
9327,josh,"Yeah, you didn't want to talk to me about banana bars by any chance, did you?"
9328,josh,Donna has stylish penmanship.
9329,josh,"You say that now, but I'm the one who's going to end up feeding him and walking him."
9330,josh,What happened to the old bear?
9333,josh,Then what are you talking to me for?
9334,josh,Did I write any of them?
9336,josh,About getting a new panda bear?
9338,josh,Toby. You should be talking to Toby. 
9341,josh,Yeah. Toby can help you out.
9342,josh,I have to tell a black civil rights lawyer why I don't owe him any money.
9368,josh,Good to meet you. Help yourself to a chair. Can Donna get you anything?
9369,josh,You were a second year summer intern at Debevoise and Plimpton when my father was a  partner there. 
9373,josh,The night of the Illinois primary.
9374,josh,"Thanks. Listen. I just got this handed to me last night, so I'm not as up to speed as  I'd like."
9377,josh,No.   There's a book coming out by Otis Hastings called The Unpaid Debt.  Hastings' position is that African Americans are owed monetary reparations for slavery.
9378,josh,You're quoted on the back jacket.
9379,josh,"You wrote, ""Otis Hastings is a unique and extraordinary historian. This book should be  read by everyone and burned into the minds of white America."""
9380,josh,"Just to start, you weren't misquoted... right?"
9381,josh,"Okay. And I'm assuming that if asked by the Committee, you'll say that you favor  reparations?"
9382,josh,And you're looking for back pay?
9383,josh,Just out of curiosity... did you have a figure in mind?
9385,josh,"Okay. Listen, this is probably a better discussion to have in the abstract, don't you  think?"
9388,c.j.,"Yes indeed. Charlie, Charlie, Charlie, Chaz."
9390,c.j.,I can bring it. What's up?
9392,c.j.,"Edgar Drumm isn't a reporter. He's a professional Bartlet baiter, and the Charleston  Citizen isn't a newspaper, it's fund-raising newsletter for the radical right. What'd  he ask her?"
9394,c.j.,I can talk to a couple of people.
9396,c.j.,Tell Danny I'm coming to see him.
9397,c.j.,I drove my boyfriend's Porsche once.
9402,toby,Yeah. Why wouldn't I be okay?
9403,toby, What do I usually say?
9405,toby,"You, on the other hand, should turn that frown upside down."
9406,toby,"Let your smile be your umbrella, Margaret."
9407,toby, Gray skies are going to clear up... Hi Bobby. Put on a happy face. Hi Janet.
9422,c.j.,You hear anything about Edgar Drumm talking to Zoey?
9431,c.j.,Nothing. Those really are nice suspenders.
9436,josh,A lesson well learned. But let's talk about your confirmation.
9437,josh,"And while we're on the subject of the Civil War, let's remember the 600,000 white men  who died over the issue of slavery."
9438,josh,"It's why a lot of them died, Jeff. And there's no other place and time in recorded  history where an event like that has occurred. So... let's... leave it at that and  move on."
9443,toby,"Madeline, you are charming and you are brilliant and for you, I have all the time in  the world."
9444,toby,"Bonnie, you are dedicated and you are beautiful. And Ginger, you are other nice things."
9446,toby,"Mandy, I feel like I've lost a hundred and eighty pounds. I'm smiling. I’m laughing.  I'm enjoying the people I work with. I gotta snap out of this.   What's on your mind?"
9447,toby," Well, that did the trick."
9450,c.j.,"Hey, Zoey, thanks for stopping by. Carol, can you get the door?"
9452,c.j.,But he pushed your buttons a little.
9453,c.j.,Did you tell him that you didn't know that David Arbor was going to be at the party?
9454,c.j.,"Okay... Zoey, I need to know why you lied to him."
9455,c.j.,And I need to know why you're lying to me right now.
9456,c.j.,"If you didn't know he was going to be there, why'd you have his car keys with you?"
9458,c.j.,They told me you were having a briefing. I didn't want to intrude.
9459,c.j.,I just needed a minute.
9460,c.j.,I'm fine. I just needed to talk to you about the party last night.
9461,c.j.,"Could you describe what, if any, contact Zoey might have had with David Arbor last night?"
9464,c.j.,I'm trying to straighten out a discrepancy with what she told me.
9465,c.j.,"Gina, I'm the press secretary. There's a story that Zoey's involved with, and I need you  to tell me what you know about last night."
9467,c.j.,Okay. Thanks. I appreciate it. Sorry about the...
9477,c.j.,Edgar Drumm ambushed Zoey when she was coming out of lunch.
9479,c.j.,Yeah. She said she didn't know David Arbor was going to be there when she did know  David Arbor was going to be there.
9481,c.j.,Spend all day surrounded by reporters? It starts to become instinct.
9483,c.j.,Yeah... well... when he hears someone tried to talk to her on campus... 
9485,c.j.,I'm not going to be able to.
9489,c.j.,Get in the President's face?
9493,c.j.,Okay.  Does anyone else have any advice... that could... uh...
9500,c.j.,Tell her you want to continue the fight over lunch.
9504,c.j.,"Yeah. It's certainly better advice than ""get in the President's face."" "
9506,c.j.,Cool. I'm going to go check the want ads.
9508,toby,A panda bear to replace Dim Sum?
9509,toby,Do you mean Hsing-Hsing?
9513,toby,I know exactly how he felt.
9515,toby,"I think it would be a good idea, as a symbol... to signal that China is serious about  their relationship with us, if they stopped running over their citizens with tanks. "
9516,toby,Mandy! Call the embassy and have them send us over a damn bear. What's the problem?
9519,toby,The other one will get lonely. Well then have them send us two.
9520,toby,"Then get us two regular bears, a bucket of black paint, a bucket of white paint,  bam, bam, next case."
9521,toby,I know. I'm Mr. Wildlife.
9523,toby,What made you think I'd be interested in this?
9526,toby," Oh... I have to say, Mandy... I'm impressed with how much you've grown."
9527,toby,"Well, there was a time if you got played by Josh like this, you'd want to get back at  him right away, and it's good to see you rise above that."
9528,toby,He used you to have a little fun with me ‘cause he has to deal with Breckenridge on  slavery reparations.
9529,toby,"Yeah, but it’s good to see you get past that."
9530,toby,Like a two-dollar banjo.
9553,bartlet,I heard. It's the first time anyone's canceled lunch on me since I took office.
9554,bartlet,I'm not saying he didn't have a good excuse.
9555,bartlet,Rules of Civility and Decent Behavior in Company and Conversation by George Washington.
9556,bartlet,"The rules were drawn from an English translation of a French book of maxims. Washington  copied them down when he was 14 years old.  ""When you sit down, keep your feet  firm and even, without putting one on the other or crossing them. Put not off your  clothes in the presence of others, nor go out of your chamber half-dressed."" What a  tightassed little priss he must've been."
9557,bartlet, Do you think I could take George Washington?
9560,bartlet,The Minutemen were good.
9564,bartlet," ""When in company, put not your hands on any part of your body not usually  covered."""
9565,c.j.,"Well... I do what it takes to keep the press corps happy, Mr. President."
9566,bartlet,"Yeah, you're right. What's going on?"
9567,c.j.,"Don't blow your stack, all right?"
9569,c.j.,Zoey lied to a reporter.
9570,bartlet,What are you talking about?
9571,c.j.,She was asked should the President's daughter be partying with drug dealers and she  said she didn't know David Arbor was going to be at the party. Except she did know.
9575,c.j.,‘Cause sometimes 19 year-old girls lie when they don't have to.
9578,bartlet,Apparently she doesn't.
9579,c.j.,"Mr. President... give her a break. This thing's happened to her friend, she doesn't  know how it affects her father. Edgar Drumm is shouting at her while she comes out  of class. She choked."
9580,bartlet, A reporter talked to her on campus?
9583,bartlet, Put the press in the briefing room. Tell them I'm coming  right over.
9586,bartlet,We have been over this and we have been over this and we have been over this! They are  not supposed to talk to my daughter on campus.
9588,bartlet,I don't give a damn if it was the Bergen County Shopper's Guide. I want to talk to the  press.
9589,c.j.,You can't talk to the press!
9591,c.j.,"I'm telling you now, Mr. President, this isn't about your daughter! It's about the first  daughter and that's my job and you're not going down there! You, me, Charlie and Zoey  are the only four people who know she was lying and there's no reason it doesn't need  to stay that way. It's a non-story. You go down there and it's a big story!"
9592,bartlet,So I just sit in my office and fume?
9593,c.j.,"Yes. And if anybody asks you, you haven't heard anything about it."
9597,c.j.,Did you know he jumped out at Zoey? Gina Toscano put him into a wall?
9600,bartlet,I haven't heard anything about it.
9602,bartlet,"I could take George Washington, by the way."
9607,c.j.,"Thank you, Mr. President. "
9608,josh,I knew you were going to bring up the Japanese.
9609,josh,They were actually in internment camps. Bring me a living slave and then you've got a case.
9610,josh,"Jeff, the committee is going to be looking for a certain degree of practicality. We don't  have $1.7 trillion. To raise $1.7 trillion, we would have to sell Texas and the U.S. Navy."
9611,josh,How about you take it in affirmative action and empowerment zones and civil rights acts?
9612,josh," You know, Jeff... I'd love to give you the money, I really  would. But I'm a little short of cash right now. It seems the S.S. officer forgot to  give my grandfather his wallet back when he let him out of Birkenau."
9613,josh,You're damn right it is! 
9614,josh,What the hell are we talking about?
9620,josh,"Yeah, okay.  Hey, Jeff."
9621,josh,"There’s going to be a lot of these meetings before your confirmation. Why don't you let  me get lunch this time, you get it next time?"
9625,toby,It looks like it’s gonna rain.
9627,toby,Isn’t that usually what it is before it rains?
9631,toby,"If it rains, please remember to change the opening line."
9633,toby,"Yeah, but if you’re wrong, you gotta change the opening line!"
9635,toby,"Okay, here’s my thing. If you’re wrong, if the coast guard is wrong, the remarks open  with “As I look out over this magnificent vista.” If the event gets moved indoors, he  will no longer be looking out over a vista of any kind."
9637,toby,"This isn’t a major policy address, Sam. This is five minutes in front of the United  Organization of Trout Fishermen. I’m saying if it gets moved inside."
9639,toby,"This is the same satellite technology we use to detect intercontinental ballistic  missiles, right?"
9642,c.j.,We should move the thing inside.
9643,toby,Sam says it’s probably not gonna rain till later.
9644,c.j.,Have either of you heard anything about a piece of paper that’s going around?
9646,c.j.,"I don’t know. At the Gaggle, Dave Trillin asked what I knew about a piece of paper  that’s going around. Maybe you used from the campaign."
9650,c.j.,"That’s good advice, Toby."
9652,c.j.,And they’re moving people inside?
9663,c.j.,How long do you think do you suppose that’s gonna last?
9664,bartlet,Can we get this Godforsaken event over with so I can get back to presiding over a  civilization gone to hell in a handcart?
9667,bartlet,There’s nothing wrong with my mood.
9668,bartlet,Would you get off me with that?
9669,bartlet,I know I’d like to beat you senseless with a head of cabbage. I know that for damn sure.
9670,bartlet,"Charlie, does anyone have my remarks?"
9672,bartlet,Why aren’t they here right now?
9673,bartlet,"Nothing like surrounding yourself with the best and the brightest, Charlie."
9675,c.j.,"Good morning, Mr. President."
9679,bartlet,You didn’t know it was raining?
9680,toby,"To our credit sir, we knew it was raining once it started to rain."
9683,bartlet,"A couple of things, uh, who am I gonna be talking to now?"
9687,bartlet,Give me the damn speech.
9689,bartlet,Have I ever been trout fishing?
9692,josh," Good morning, Mr. President."
9694,josh,"The C.V.O.’s gonna revise its outyear projections, two commissioners resigned from the  F.E.C. this morning, and the N.G.A. endorsed trigger locks."
9700,bartlet,Two F.E.C. commissioners resigned?
9702,bartlet,There are two seats open in the F.E.C.?
9707,bartlet,"Leo, two seats just opened up in the Federal Election Commission."
9709,bartlet,"I’m saying, what if this time we say we want our guys?"
9711,bartlet,"Yeah, but we can dangle our feet in the water."
9715,bartlet,"I’m talking about dangling our feet in the water. Josh, get Leo two candidates who back  aggressive campaign finance reform."
9716,josh,"Sir, I-I got to stand with Leo on this. I think that-"
9717,bartlet,"I’m not saying jump off the boat, Josh. I’m saying dangle our feet."
9723,bartlet,"No, I’m definitely gonna be thinking about the trout fishermen, Leo, ‘cause that’s  where my focus should be."
9725,bartlet,"I was in a better mood a year ago, Leo."
9726,c.j., Does anybody know anything about a piece of paper that’s been going  around?
9729,bartlet,"C.J., are you taller than you usually are?"
9730,c.j.,Yes sir. I’m my usual height.
9732,bartlet,"Couldn’t pick a trout out of a police lineup, by the way."
9734,josh,Two Federal Election seats open on the same day?
9736,josh,"That’s what I thought too, but after your little pep talk just now..."
9742,josh,Six commissioners are appointed for a six-year term.
9744,josh,Two seats come up every two years.
9754,josh,There’s a couple of roadblocks.
9756,josh,"Whenever a vacancy comes up, the party leadership of both sides...  Did you just  call me “baby” back there?"
9758,josh,"Okay. Uh, when a vacancy comes up, it’s up to the President to fill it, but the party  leadership on both sides always, always, always dictates to the President who he’s gonna  appoint. One Republican. One Democrat. Whoever the leadership says. That’s how you keep  the peace."
9760,josh,"No, but I’m gonna spend the rest of the week trying."
9762,josh,You’re right. I’m gonna need a bagel. 
9763,c.j.,"The Easter egg hunt and the Easter egg roll are two different things. The theme of this  year’s event is “Learning is delightful and delicious,” as, by the way, am I."
9764,c.j.,"The collection, which is gonna be on display on the east colonnade to the White House,  features real chicken eggs decorated by artists from each of the 50 states and the  district. And the activities are coordinated by the American Egg Board. And I’ve hung  with some of the cats from the American Egg Board, and they are party people.  Thank you. That’s it for this afternoon."
9767,c.j.,What have you heard about a piece of paper that’s out there?
9770,c.j.,"If you hear anything more, you’ll tell me first?"
9771,c.j.,I keep forgetting you don’t work for me.
9773,c.j.,"Mandy, there’s a buzz in the room. Something about a piece-"
9774,c.j.,Do you know anything about it?
9777,c.j.,"Katie, they’re in the blue room."
9778,c.j.,"You worked for us for a year and a half, and you work for us again now..."
9779,c.j.,"...And in between, you wrote a playbook on how to beat us?"
9780,c.j.,I need to see a copy of it right now!
9790,josh,John Bacon and Patricia Calhoun.
9792,josh,Patty Calhoun’s the director of the Roe Institute for Economic Policy Studies at the  Heritage Foundation. She worked in the White House O.M.B. under two Republican Presidents.
9796,josh,What do you want me to do?
9798,josh,You want me to meet with the leadership?
9800,josh,"Leo, the President can’t think we’re gonna get anywhere with this, can he?"
9802,josh,"The President doesn’t think we’re gonna get anywhere with this, can he?"
9805,josh,What happened with e-mail?
9809,toby,Who’d you come up with?
9810,josh,John Bacon and Patty Calhoun.
9812,josh,Tell me something else I should know. What are you doing?
9813,toby,It’s our turn with the boys.
9820,toby,"Good morning. Good morning. We all know each other. Why don’t we sit down? We’ve been  conducting meetings with various senior staff on the D.O.D., N.S.C. and House and  Senate Armed Services. We feel a little hamstrung because of the policy inherited  regarding gays and lesbians in the military. And we’d like as much reform input as  possible before making a recommendation to the President."
9822,toby,"Well, actually, it’ll be Sam’s recommendation to the President. It’s on his desk, and  I’m just helping out."
9825,toby,I guess it’s gonna be a pretty short meeting.
9828,c.j.,What are the other eggs made out of?
9834,c.j.,Would you tell him when he has a free moment I’d like to see him?
9836,c.j.,"Carol, 25,000 wooden eggs."
9837,c.j.,They’re just regular eggs.
9841,c.j.,Okay. I’m gonna read it now.
9842,c.j.,"Go back to your office, and don’t answer any questions."
9844,josh,"Soft money contributions render the 1974 Campaign Reform Act toothless. Soft money  contributions, which were ostensibly designed for party-building, whatever that might  mean, do nothing but eviscerate any meaningful election controls. We are, by definition,  corrupt."
9845,josh,"I know you wouldn’t, Steve. This money isn’t coming in in 5’s and 10’s and 20’s. It’s  coming in in denominations of 100, 200, 500 thousand dollars. It’s coming from special  interests. It’s coming from special interests whose interests aren’t the same as those  who don’t have a half a million bucks lying around, and it’s not going to party-building.  It’s going to issue ads. It’s going to candidates."
9846,josh,"If the insurance company wants to buy ad time from 64 major markets, they are free to do  so. If the airplane manufacturing industry wants to back a candidate, they are free to  shout from the rooftops. If big tobacco wants to wave a sign or put a bumper sticker on  their cars, they are free to do so. That’s free speech. Money isn’t speech."
9847,josh,"I came here as a courtesy, Jerry. I came at the request of Leo McGarry. The President is  strong considering... John Branford Bacon and Patty Calhoun to fill in the two seats."
9848,josh,Two people who oppose any campaign finance reform. Well...
9849,josh,He raised a lot of money in Indiana. And Joe Barkley says that people are allowed to  spend whatever they want in politics.
9851,josh,The President makes appointments to the Federal Election Commission.
9852,josh,Wouldn’t it be easier to just not confirm our nominees?
9853,josh,"Are you saying that in addition to voting down our nominees, there’s gonna be political  retribution for having nominated them in the first place?"
9854,josh, Reject whatever you want.
9855,josh,"I said reject whatever you want! You know, four hours ago, this was a fool’s errand for  me, and the President knew it. This was a test balloon. This was a “just out of curiosity  let’s see what would happen if” meeting, but you’ve managed to get me on board."
9861,toby,"Major, what the hell is going on at Lackland Air Force Base?"
9863,c.j., Excuse me. I’m sorry. I need Toby.
9864,toby,Yeah.  Come here a sec.
9865,toby,You’re doing good.  What?
9866,c.j.,I know what the piece of paper is.
9868,c.j.,It’s a recon-and-strategy memo that Mandy wrote when she was working for Russell.
9870,c.j.,Beat us in three years.
9877,josh, How do you know to be standing here?
9879,josh,You don’t have a window.
9881,josh,What are you doing in my office when I’m not there?
9889,josh,"I don’t, Donna, and the way that you know that I don’t, is that I’m not."
9891,josh,I’m really not in the mood to mess around.
9893,josh,I need you to get me prepped on something.
9895,josh,English as the national language.
9899,josh,"Because...it doesn’t matter. Because if we do a thing with the F.E.C., opponents will  put English as the national language on the table."
9905,josh,"Donna, didn’t I just say that I can’t mess around?"
9915,toby,"I’m not taking any calls right now, Ginger."
9917,toby, “The reality of the Bartlet White House is a flood of mistakes. An agenda  hopelessly stalled and lacking a coherent strategy. An administration plagued by  indecision...”
9920,c.j.,"Mandy wrote an instruction manual for Russell, and it’s out there somewhere."
9924,c.j.,"Well, she takes the three of us to town. We don’t look like rocket scientists. But,  then again, we’re not rocket scientists."
9926,toby,The President... Leo. The President and Leo.
9927,josh,We don’t know who has this?
9928,c.j.,I’m talking to everybody in the room.
9930,toby,And quickly. Whose paper will it be in tomorrow? We have to know right away.
9932,josh,"Our second year doesn’t seem to be going a whole lot better than our first, does it?"
9934,toby,"Margaret, does he have a minute?"
9940,toby,Good afternoon admiral.
9946,toby,They’re meeting with Sam on gays in the military.
9947,toby,Sam’s trying to put together a coherent position.
9948,toby,"Yes, sir. By the way, there may be a major security breach with the White House computers."
9949,toby,Well... that explains that.
9951,toby,The President’s gonna say it’s redundant.
9955,toby,So...there’s gonna be a thing.
9957,toby,"Mandy wrote an opposition research memo for Russell, and somebody’s got it."
9961,toby,Yeah... There’s some observations the President’s not gonna be wild about.
9963,toby,"The sense is that his instinct is to be aggressive, and you take him to safe ground."
9979,josh,I didn’t ask for a damn social studies paper. I-I-
9985,josh,"I wasn’t snapping at you. I just, I-I didn’t realize that you also gave me the stuff I  asked for. I thought it was just...you know, I thought you just gave me James Madison."
9990,josh,The President wants to put two reformers on the F.E.C. Onorato says they’ll retaliate  by opening up English as the national language.
9991,josh,"I’ve been working here 14 months, Mandy. Tell me what else I should know."
9994,josh,"You know, today, isn’t really the best day for you to tell me what your job is."
9995,josh,You never heard of a burn bag?
9997,josh,Then there’s not much you can do for us today.
9998,josh,"Mandy, it’s not gonna happen. Don’t worry about it. It’s not gonna happen. The  President’s not gonna nominate who he wants in the F.E.C."
9999,josh,’Cause it’s not what we do.
10001,josh,It’s everyone that’s feeling this way today?
10016,c.j.,I was hoping to find you here. I wanted to ask you-
10018,c.j.,"Danny, is it the Magna Carta or-?"
10020,c.j.,"Okay. You’ve heard there’s a piece of paper out there, right?"
10022,c.j.,"That’s right.  You got to know, I don’t want exploiting our friendship in any  way, and I certainly don’t like taking advantage of any feelings beyond friendship you  might have for me."
10024,c.j.,I need to be ready for this...Do you know who has it?
10027,c.j.,And you’re gonna write about it?
10031,c.j.,"It’s not news just because it’s entertaining, Danny."
10032,c.j.,Mandy wasn’t working for the President at the time she wrote this memo-
10034,c.j.,We’ll have a comment for you at the end of the day.
10035,c.j.,None of what is your fault?
10045,toby,Get me a muffin. Be careful not to handle it yourself. You want to use gloves. Slip it  to me in a plastic bag. I’ll send it off to the lab.
10050,toby,"I got my second bit of bad news for you today, Leo."
10054,toby,CNN/USA Today puts our job approval at 42%.
10058,toby,His unfavorables are higher than his favorables for the first time. Fifty-four percent  of the country is likely to vote for a Republican Congressional candidate in November.
10064,toby,"One victory in a year, Leo."
10066,toby,Mendoza. We got Mendoza on the Court.
10068,toby,"Yeah, but he was elected."
10070,toby,"I don’t care, Leo. He was elected. He was sworn in. I was standing ten feet from the  chief justice."
10072,toby,Who the hell said it would be easy?
10074,toby,"One victory in a year stinks in a life of an administration. But it’s not the ones we  lose that bother me, Leo. It’s the ones we don’t suit up for!   And I’m not too crazy about you questioning my loyalty just then."
10078,c.j.,The President’s reading Mandy’s memo. I just gave it to him.
10082,c.j.,It’s gonna be in the newspapers tomorrow.
10086,c.j.,Yeah. It should run right next to the new polling numbers.
10087,josh,How did we drop five points in a week?
10089,josh,"What I think is, the Senate will confirm Bacon and Calhoun. They’ll have to ‘cause  their credentials are too good, and the voters want campaign reform. As a punishment,  they’ll roll out a legislative agenda designed to force the President to come down on  the unpopular side of everything. For instance, they’ll bring out English as the  national language. I believe-"
10091,josh,I think we shouldn’t be afraid-
10093,josh,"Leo, I think we shouldn’t be afraid to get into it on English as the-"
10095,josh,Then we’ll live with their candidates for the F.E.C.
10106,bartlet,Why am I just finding out about this now?
10108,bartlet,I really did wake up energized this morning.
10110,bartlet,I never go to bed that way.
10112,bartlet,"Just once, in this job, I’d like to end a day feeling as good as I did when the day  started.  Are you bothered by this?"
10116,bartlet,"We’ve heard it all before, Leo. You drive me to political safe ground. It’s not true."
10120,bartlet, What the hell did you say?
10126,bartlet,You want to do this now?
10128,bartlet,"You came to my house, Leo."
10130,bartlet,"You came to my house, and you said, “Jed, let’s run for President.” I said, “Why?”  And you said, “So that you can open your mouth and say what you think!” Where’d that  part go, Leo?"
10136,bartlet,Did I not say put our guys on the F.E.C.?
10140,bartlet,"You’re writing a fascinating version of history, my friend."
10142,bartlet,You brought me in on teachers. You brought me in on capital gains. You brought me in  on China. And you brought me in on guns.
10146,bartlet,"Leo, if I ever told you to get aggressive about campaign finance or gays in the military,  you would tell me, “Don’t run too fast or go to far.”"
10148,bartlet,"I have said it, and nothing’s every happened!"
10150,bartlet,I don’t want to feel like this anymore.
10152,bartlet,I don’t want to go to sleep like this.
10156,bartlet,This is more important than reelection. I want to speak now.
10158,bartlet,This is more important than reelection. I want to speak now.
10164,bartlet,This is more important than reelection. I want to speak now.
10166,bartlet,You have a strategy for all this?
10174,josh,I serve at the pleasure of the President of the United States.
10176,c.j.,I serve at the pleasure of the President.
10179,toby,I serve at the pleasure of the President.
10182,bartlet,"I get nervous around laws that fundamentally assume that Americans can't be trusted.  We’d better have mandatory sentencing, because judges can't be trusted to disperse  even-handed justice."
10183,bartlet,"We better have term limits, ‘cause voters can't be trusted to recognize corruption."
10184,bartlet,"Oh, and by the way... I say, by the way. When the playing field is leveled and the  process is fair and open, it turns out we have term limits. They're called elections."
10185,c.j.,"As a matter of fact, the President had a bowl of oatmeal this morning. He said it was  something he's always wanted to try.  Folks, listen up. In a moment or two, the President is going to say something that's  sure to get you all shouting my name at once. There'll be a full briefing tonight at  the White House."
10186,c.j.,Yeah. You're not going to want to miss this.
10187,c.j.,The President's going to throw his cap over the wall.
10188,c.j.,You're about to find out.
10189,bartlet,"My father was very fond of the analogy of the Irish lads whose journey was blocked by  a brick wall, seemingly too high to scale. Throwing their caps over the wall, the lads  had no choice but to follow. How many times in the great history of our country have  we come to a wall seemingly too high to scale only to throw our caps to the other side?"
10190,bartlet," Tomorrow... tomorrow morning, we're going to begin to change the way elections  are supervised in this country. "
10191,bartlet, I am proud to nominate John Branford Bacon and Patricia Calhoun to the  Federal Election Commission.
10209,toby,"Now, I'm telling you to leave him alone."
10210,josh,"Guys, I'm trying to watch this speech."
10214,toby,"Josh, if you need us, we're standing right here."
10215,josh," Hi, Senator. Why don't you take your legislative agenda and shove it up  your ass. "
10217,c.j.,"I'd like to emphasize again that the President has nominated one Democrat and one  Republican, which he was, certainly, under no legal obligation to do. "
10219,c.j.,"In the past, the F.E.C. Commissioners has been chosen by the President, signing off on  whomever the Congressional Leadership pointed to."
10220,c.j.,I think it's possible we forgot to tell them.
10221,josh,Say it's a police action.
10222,c.j.," The President isn't empowered to declare war. The President is empowered.  In fact, he's obligated to nominate Federal Agency Directors. I call it more of a  police action. "
10229,josh,He's bringing in Al Kiefer?
10237,josh,"It's a big polling week, Donna. I figured he was bringing in Kiefer."
10239,josh,That's what you were afraid to tell me?
10243,josh,"That's a good idea, cause... wait... "
10249,josh,You... you shouldn't have been. You know why?
10251,josh,It's no big deal. And I'll tell you what else.
10253,josh,I... I am a pro. But that's not what I was going to say.
10255,josh,That's what I was going to say.
10257,josh,"But, both those things are true. I'm a pro and what was the other one?"
10261,josh,"That's how we do things in New England, my friends. "
10264,toby, That's good... good... Okay... Sam?
10266,toby,"You're going to come to a verb soon, right?"
10270,toby,"Well, you say potato... Josh, it's a big polling week. I'm bringing in Al Kiefer. "
10271,josh,You've turned 180 degrees on Kiefer. You know that?
10272,toby,I haven't turned on Kiefer at all. I don't want him advising the President. I want him  bringing us numbers.
10273,josh,Advising people is what pollsters do.
10274,toby,He'll do what I tell him to do. Also....
10275,josh,English as the National Language.
10277,toby,We need Hispanics. You know what state has a large population of Hispanics?
10278,josh,"Uh... I want to say Maine, but uh... "
10280,josh,"California. Damn, and I was only off by a continent."
10282,josh,It's fine. Bring her out here.
10283,toby,She'll be here tomorrow.
10288,josh,Okay.  We had a good night.
10290,josh, C.J.'s doing great in there.
10291,toby,"Any time you want to use punctuation, that'd be fine."
10292,c.j.,I'm going to take one more question. Katie.
10293,c.j.,"I wouldn't say the F.E.C. was merely symbolic, but if you're suggesting they're  toothless, I'll agree with you."
10295,c.j.,Symbolism. There'll be plenty more tomorrow. Everybody have a good night.
10300,toby,"I understand that, too."
10302,toby,Everything you've said I understand.
10304,toby,We do things one thing at a time.
10306,toby,We're talking about treatment.
10308,toby,"When you talk to the President, I want you talking about treatment. I want you talking  about treatment vs. enforcement and I don't want you to stray from that!"
10310,toby,"Yes, I meant, you're in charge of this, in the sense that you're subordinate to me in  every way.  Where is this place?"
10314,toby,Why didn't you say anything?
10318,josh,Leo. We couldn't meet closer to the office?
10320,josh,We couldn't meet in the office?
10322,josh,We couldn't have food ordered?
10329,josh,We need a California expert and this is my regular Tuesday suit.
10330,josh,I'm saying there's no particular M.O. behind...
10335,toby,We can make a case for treatment vs. enforcement and we're ready to go to the President.
10347,toby,It's exactly the right thing to do.
10349,josh,I'd like to clear up that I... I don't have suits for the days of the week. This is  just a regular suit. 
10357,josh,Joey... Joey Lucas is a woman... and I'm not getting dressed up for her.
10373,c.j.,Leo’s not comfortable with it.
10378,c.j.,Do you have any idea how pissed people are at you? 
10379,c.j.,"They're pissed at me, that's how pissed they are at you. They want to know how the hell  I didn't know about the memo."
10380,c.j.,We'll see. There's plenty for you to do. Leo would feel more comfortable if you stayed  out of this...
10385,josh,...which total 17.6 billion...
10389,bartlet,"We don't care do we, Sam?"
10392,bartlet,"Kiefer's been here 45 minutes, he's already got me on the playground at recess."
10394,toby,"Mr. President, Sam and I have been working with the Office of National Drug Control  Policy, we have some numbers you should hear."
10397,josh,What are you smiling at?
10402,josh,What makes you think I need any help?
10404,josh,"Hey, Joey. Hey, Kenny. Good to see you. I got your desks set up out here. Why don't you  come with me? "
10406,josh,"Joey, we're in a bit of a mode here and I think it's best if we just do business. Plus,  this is the White House. I wouldn't expect candy and flowers on your arrival."
10407,josh, Go back to your office.
10408,josh,"This is your desk. You got a phone. You got a computer. You got access to a staff.  I know how women like to personalize their desks with flowers, and plants, and hand  lotion, but I prefer the place to be professional."
10409,josh,"Some of them might, and I'm saying we don't do that on my side of the building.   I'm going to go back to this meeting and then I'll brief you on what I need."
10413,josh,This is a place where solemn work is done. This is a place... this is a place... let me  say this... this is not a place where one's personal things... where things among people...  this is not a place... let's... This is a place where work is done and nothing else.
10416,c.j.,"Josh, listen. I misspoke last night. I said the President nominated a Democrat and a  Republican, even though he was under no legal obligation to do so. It turns out he is."
10419,josh,This from the White House counsel?
10423,josh,You said he nominated a Democrat and a Republican.
10424,c.j.,"Even though he was under no legal obligation to do so. Yeah, I just looked at the  transcript."
10425,josh,All right. You'll fix it at the briefing?
10430,toby,"The A.M.A. says it, why does it he have to sell it?"
10431,toby,Drug addiction is a disease. It's a... it's... it's a... medical problem. It can be  treated. This isn't ideological. It's science.
10432,toby," Science is science to everybody, Al."
10434,bartlet,Toby was just explaining to Al that science is science to everyone.
10435,josh,"I'm sorry, Mr. President. While Al tries to come up with something easier to sell than  science, would you mind if I spoke to Toby and Leo alone?"
10439,josh,"Hey, Joey Lucas says she's not with Kiefer anymore."
10441,josh,"Yeah... uh... C.J. misspoke last night during her briefing... uh, she'll fix it when  she gets back in there. "
10443,josh,She said the President nominated a Democrat and a Republican when he was under no legal  obligation to do so.
10449,josh,How's it going in there?
10451,josh,"You talked to him about the thing, yet?  "
10455,josh,We want you to go to a meeting.
10457,josh,"A prominent House Democrat who has a voice on Campaign Finance Reform and if it was  someone on the Ethics Committee that'd be even better, cause then she could answer some  of Leo’s questions."
10458,toby, I used to be married to someone who fits that description.
10460,toby,You set me up on a date with my ex-wife?
10465,josh,"See ya later.  Leo, you had to send flowers?"
10467,josh,"Yeah, but I had this whole patter thing going... and then... the hell with it. "
10477,josh,I see you're all settled in.
10478,josh,"Area looks good. Not too many personal items. Got your little clock, that's fine."
10479,josh,"Here's the story. The President announced last night, he's naming two Campaign Finance  Reform minded nominees to the F.E.C. This will anger the Republican Leadership to the  extent they'll retaliate. Retaliate, how? They'll introduce a series of bills design to  put the President on the wrong side of public debates. The first will be a law making  English the National language."
10484,toby,"Mr. President, we can sell the public on the idea that 2 million bucks a day can be put  to better use."
10488,bartlet,I'm hungry and so far nobody has convinced me of anything.
10508,toby,"There are restaurants, you know, indoors, with waiters and tables."
10510,toby,I'm a responsible adult.
10518,toby,The President's not gonna ask anyone to give up soft money unilaterally.
10521,toby,But we have your people in line?
10526,toby,I know what you're saying. I don't want to talk about Mandatory Minimums.
10527,toby,"Andy, I don't want to..."
10528,toby,"This is what happens. This is what you do. I say I don't want to talk about Mandatory  Minimums and we talk about Mandatory Minimums anyway. You hijack my ability to make that  decision for myself, Andrea. And making decisions for myself is my birthright!"
10530,toby,You don't have a problem with what Leo’s gonna do?
10534,toby,Not everything is fun....
10535,toby,"If you want to be there, you can be there, but this is a serious thing."
10537,toby,"Can you walk faster, please? I really don't like to be outdoors this long."
10555,c.j.,I was just coming to see you.
10557,c.j.,You're people are here. They're in the press briefing room.
10559,c.j.,Carol’s keeping the press in the northeast lobby. She'll wait for your high sign.
10561,c.j.,We're telling anyone who asks why the press is out of there that it's a special event.
10563,c.j.,"Leo, I don't know if you've heard..."
10575,c.j.,We'll talk in my office.
10576,c.j.,There's a meeting in there.
10579,c.j.,Don't talk to me like that in front of people.
10580,c.j.,No! I just got called amateur twice in 10 seconds. The White House Chief of Staff can do  it to me wherever he wants. You don't do it in front of people.
10581,c.j.,I would think a man with your credentials...
10584,c.j.,"Congratulations, you're a movie star. You're also on the outside looking in for a while,  so get used to it."
10585,c.j.,DON’T tell me what I don't understand! I'm not in my freshman year anymore. I understand  more than you think.
10594,toby,Six months house arrest.
10596,toby,Each stolen pill carries the penalty of one year in prison and a monetary fine.
10598,toby,He went to a pre-trial diversion program. There's no longer any criminal record.
10601,toby,She paid a fine of $2800 and forfeited her car in which the drugs were found.
10609,toby,"I have to get back to work. And you, being a Congresswoman... I'm sure you need to be  back out there... you know, screwing the people."
10613,toby,"You didn't say, ""Officer, I'm a member of Congress, isn't there anything we can do  about this?"""
10615,toby,Executive advisor for the Orioles?
10616,toby,You went out on a date with the executive advisor for the Baltimore Orioles?
10617,toby,"Honest to God, I'm not sure."
10618,toby,What are you doing getting into cars with guys that have been drinking?
10619,toby,That's what taxicabs are for.
10620,toby,"And also, I can still do that."
10621,toby,"If it wasn't an Oriole, absolutely. Or a Red Sock. In fact, just date the National  League, would you? "
10630,bartlet,"Well, yeah, that's cause I answered the phone. "
10634,bartlet,"Yeah, I got to be up in four hours, anyway."
10636,josh,F.E.C. Where's the President?
10638,josh,Why are you telling me?
10644,toby, Tell him what you told me.
10646,toby,Tell him what you told me.
10654,toby,He even pointed out to Sam that Sam was working on drugs for the White House.
10655,josh," You made the big time, Sam."
10659,toby,He knows you’re friends with a call girl.
10661,josh,He wants to move you out to the front of the field so he can drop Laurie on you.
10665,josh,"It's okay, Sam. You haven't done anything wrong."
10667,toby, We're serious. Don't worry about it.
10669,toby,...credulous simplicity?
10677,josh,I've already done that.
10679,josh,"You know what this is like? This is like The Godfather. When Pacino tells James Caan  that he's gonna kill the cop. It's a lot like that scene, only not really."
10681,josh,He's... he's still here somewhere.
10683,josh,It is like that scene. I'm James Caan.  You're...you're Al Pacino.
10685,josh,"Toby, you're the guy who shows Pacino how to make tomato sauce. "
10687,josh,"I'll be right behind, I'm gonna pick up the late wires."
10690,josh,I saw the light was on. You guys are here late.
10691,josh,I brought you a coffee mug.
10692,josh,"Just as a thing, cause you don't know anybody. It's got... uh... a picture of the White  House. It says, “The White House.” Seal of the President. It's a White House coffee mug."
10693,josh,"Kenny, can you give us a second?"
10694,josh,"I wore this suit, special today. This isn't my regular Tuesday suit."
10696,josh,"Yeah... So... Okay, I gotta go. "
10700,bartlet,"Well, I wasn't listening to a lot of it."
10702,bartlet,"Leo, if there's anyone qualified to talk about the benefits of treatment vs. criminal  action, it's you. Is there anyone whose life would be better right now, if you'd had  gone to jail instead of rehab?"
10704,bartlet,Thank you. Is there anything else?
10708,c.j.,"I'm sorry. I heard Leo was here, I assumed you were awake. "
10710,c.j.,"I haven't seen you all day, I just... wanted to apologize for the gaffe at the briefing  last night."
10711,bartlet,"You fixed it this afternoon, right?"
10715,bartlet,"No need to apologize, but I accept your apology and now I'm ready, if not eager, to  move on."
10719,bartlet,Not for a little while now.
10723,bartlet,"Guys, let me tell you what I would like to have happen, right now."
10724,josh," Good evening, Mr. President."
10725,bartlet,Josh walking in the door wasn't even close. 
10726,josh,"How you doing, tonight?"
10727,bartlet,"I'm fine, thanks. How you doing?"
10728,josh,Good! I gave Joey Lucas a coffee mug. She doesn't know anybody here and she's already  working hard. She's very committed. I think I did the right thing.
10729,bartlet,"See, the part I don't understand is, I got like, 24 armed guards right outside my  bedroom door..."
10731,bartlet,"I'm a day closer. There'll be more meetings tomorrow. In the meantime, everybody calm  down. Leo’s got your engines fired like you're running Daytona. That's fine. Keep them  there. Guess what? Mistakes are gonna be made. Minimize them, fix them, move on. Kiefer's  numbers got you scared? Listen to me. I have never lost an election in my life. We do  this right, people are going to respond. You all had a good day. "
10732,josh,We should go and leave you now.
10733,bartlet,You guys should feel free to do this when my wife is here.
10737,bartlet,Everybody. Mandy was doing her job. It's time to let her out of the doghouse.
10739,bartlet, She was doing her job. C.J.?
10746,toby,I... met with Congresswoman Wyatt today.
10747,bartlet,"When you were married to her, did you call her Congresswoman Wyatt?"
10749,bartlet,"Sometimes I call my wife, Dr. Bartlet."
10750,toby,I call her Andy or uh... Andrea.
10753,bartlet,"You're whupped, my friend."
10755,bartlet,"No, she's been talking to your for a year about Mandatory Minimums. You've been saying  no. Looks like we know who wears the pants in the Ziegler family."
10756,toby,You call your wife “Dr. Bartlet”?
10758,toby,"Uh... the thing is, she's right."
10760,toby,Mandatory Minimums are considerably higher for crack than for powder cocaine.
10762,toby,The vast majority of crack users are black. The vast majority of drug users are white.  The Mandatory Minimums are racist. 
10764,toby,It should be part of the discussion.
10766,toby,Good... uh... good night.
10767,bartlet," When I sleep, I dream about a great discussion  with experts and ideas and diction and energy and honesty. And when I wake up, I think,  ""I can sell that."""
10777,josh,My watch says ten to seven.
10781,josh,How do I know it isn’t ten to seven?
10783,toby,Question six is asymmetrical.
10785,toby,"""Would you say things in this country are going in the right direction or do you think  they’ve gotten off on the wrong track?"""
10786,josh,He’s got a good point about this.
10789,toby,Should be right direction or wrong direction.
10791,toby,Direction and track are two different words!
10792,c.j.,"Thank you, Funk and Wagnall’s. "
10794,toby,I know who Funk and Wagnall’s are.
10796,toby,The question is asymmetrical.
10797,c.j.,"That may be so, but the question originated 2 decades ago and has proven to be a  consistent predictor of a voter’s potential behavior. So it stays the way it is. "
10798,josh,I have a problem with fourteen.
10800,josh,"""When making policy decisions, do you think that President Bartlet puts the needs of  average people first?"" ""Average people"" is a pejorative phrase and occurs about six  times in the polling model. "
10801,c.j.,"This may come as a shock to you, but 80% of the people in this country would use the  word ""average"" to describe themselves. They do not find the term deprecating. Indeed,  being considered an ""average American"" is something they find to be positive and  comforting."
10804,c.j.,"Leo, we went over this."
10805,toby,We need to talk about the asymmetry of question six.
10807,toby,Since when are you an expert on language?
10810,c.j.,1993. Since when are you an uptight pain in the ass?
10811,toby,Since long before that.
10813,c.j.,"Again, we went over this."
10817,c.j.,"The respondent isn’t confused by the question and separating the respondent from the  interviewer with ""people like yourself"" is pejorative. So, Ed, Larry, you can take this  up with Josh. Leo, Eastern Standard Time is sitting down to dinner. The poll is fine. "
10818,josh,"It’s an important poll, C.J."
10819,c.j.,"I’m aware of its importance. I’m also aware that if we don’t start the phone banks  right now, I might not have enough time to leak the internals to media outlets before  we hit the weekend."
10820,toby,There’s still the matter...
10821,c.j.,"So, it turns out that over the last 3 weeks we managed to climb out of the hole, only  we can’t tell anybody about it ‘til Monday, cause we stood here all night arguing about  asymmetry!  It’s time."
10823,josh,I’ll be happy if we hold steady.
10824,toby,"We’ll drop a few points, but it’ll be inside the plus or minus. "
10825,c.j.,We’re going to go up five points.
10827,c.j.,The President is wrong.
10839,toby,The G.W. Law School graduation is tomorrow.
10841,toby,Were you going to go see your friend?
10845,toby,Were you going to see her graduate Law School tomorrow?
10849,toby,I really do believe Steve Onorato knows and he’s...
10851,toby,He’ll try and use it to embarrass us.
10853,toby,They may know who this girl is. They know she’s graduating Law School tomorrow. They know  it’s someplace you’ll likely to be. Maybe they’ll want to snap a picture. Maybe...
10863,toby,"Not just South Carolina, Sam."
10903,bartlet,"Not at all, we’re just having a nightcap."
10905,bartlet,"Oh, may I present Treasury Secretary, Kenneth..."
10907,bartlet,"Our CIA Director, Rob Conrad."
10908,bartlet,"Barry, I’m Jed Bartlet. I understand you’re thinking about helping us out. It makes me  so happy. "
10909,bartlet,"Well, let’s get him a drink."
10912,bartlet,This could all be for nothing.
10914,bartlet,"I mean, if the numbers... "
10918,bartlet,All right. Did the guys make any predictions?
10924,bartlet,I mean it could be worse than holding at 42.
10926,bartlet,"‘Cause if these numbers keep going down, I’m just a guy with Barry Haskell in his office."
10928,bartlet,A dress Marine guarding your door?
10930,bartlet,"Nah... My thing is, what’s he suppose to be guarding right now? "
10944,toby,I need you to arrange a meeting with Ross Kassenbach.
10945,toby,"As soon as possible. Also, I need the next two minutes the President’s got."
10949,toby,Ambassador to the Federated States of Micronesia.
10957,toby, Come with me for this. 
10959,bartlet,Based on what is he making that claim?
10961,bartlet,We’ve been out there for three weeks.
10964,bartlet,"We’ve been... we’ve been out there for three weeks. Crossfire, Meet the Press, Charlie  Rose, The Today Show, The Tonight Show, Good Morning Scottsdale..."
10966,bartlet,"...Time, Newsweek, Popular Mechanics. We’ve been out there saying we’re not talking about  legalization. We are talking about treatment."
10967,c.j.,There’s a memo. It’s the same memo that’s been generated by every administration for  thirty years.
10968,bartlet,"Well, how do you want to handle it?"
10969,c.j.,By saying it’s the same that’s been generated by every administration for thirty years. 
10970,bartlet,I don’t know. It sounds like we’re soft on the issue.
10971,toby,"Good morning, Mr. President."
10973,bartlet,Steve Onorato is saying I want to legalize drugs. 
10976,toby,"C.J., that’s exactly what you should say."
10978,bartlet,Hmmm... Leo was in here last night. He said you guys predicted we’d hold steady at 42.  Were you just being optimistic or you really think we held our ground. 
10979,toby,"I said we might drop a couple, but inside the margin."
10983,c.j.,"I didn’t say we’d hold steady at 42, Mr. President. I said we’d gain five points. "
10986,bartlet,"Well, okay. Anybody want to offer C.J. the odds? "
10989,bartlet,Tell them every administration for the past thirty years has generated that memo.
10992,c.j.,"Thank you, Mr. President.  "
10994,toby,The Federated States of Micronesia.
10996,bartlet, It is a country. You know where?
10997,toby,I assume it’s a small island in the South Pacific.
10998,bartlet,"It’s actually 607 small islands in the South Pacific. Interestingly, while its total  land mass is only 270 square miles, it occupies more than a million square miles of the  Pacific Ocean. Population is 127,000 and the U.S. Embassy is located in the state of  Pohnpei and not, as many people believe, on the island of Yap."
10999,toby,Why would a person have that information at their disposal? 
11002,bartlet,I looked at the Federated States of Micronesia. I can’t fire our ambassador.
11004,bartlet,Somebody’s going to ask me why I fired him and I’m not gonna be able to come up with  the answer they’re looking for.
11005,toby,"Well, Sam’s got you covered."
11010,bartlet,And what happens to the ambassador of Paraguay?
11012,bartlet,"Hey, I like this. Of course, if everybody keeps moving up one, then I get to go home."
11014,bartlet,"That ambassador is Ken Cochran, isn’t it?"
11016,bartlet,He’s having an affair with the daughter of the Bulgarian Prime Minister?
11017,toby,"Who, the State Department, is saying is upset."
11020,bartlet,Prime Minister of Bulgaria?
11024,bartlet,I got to fire Ken Cochran?
11026,bartlet,"All right, then I don’t want it to be because of the girl."
11029,toby,We can create legitimate grounds for incompetence.
11030,bartlet,"Well, it looks to me like there are legitimate grounds for incompetence, but... come up  with different ones, would you? "
11032,bartlet,"All right, let’s do it."
11034,bartlet,"I need to meet with Ambassador Cochran. He can be found in his office at the U.S Embassy  in Bulgaria, or not. Either way, I’d like the State Department to put his ass on a plane  and have it in this office tomorrow. "
11038,bartlet,"It looked like when I said ""Ken Cochran"", that you knew who he was."
11040,josh,They might put it on the table.
11042,josh,I’m saying if they do put it on the table...
11043,josh,Is there any possibility you’re going to let me finish a sentence? Is there any chance  at all that that’s going to happen?
11044,josh,How the hell do you know if I’m raising my voice to you?
11045,josh,You’re here to give me a counter argument on English as the official language of the  United States. You are not here to speculate on whether or not the Republicans are going  to put the issue on the table.
11052,josh,C.J. started the briefing already?
11054,josh,The briefing is not supposed to start ‘til eleven.
11058,josh," Okay, I’ll be back and when I get back, you’re going to argue with me and we’re  going to argue about the things I want to argue about and you’re going to do your best not  to annoy me so much. "
11059,josh,Oh-ho-ho!  Many have tried.
11060,josh,Did Toby find a country?
11062,josh,Is that a real country?
11064,josh,When was I supposed to take you to Hawaii?
11066,josh,The Federated States of Micronesia.
11073,c.j.,"Hang on, Mandatory Minimums requires a federal judge to sentence anyone convicted of  possessing five grams of crack to at least five years in prison. It takes 100 times as  much powder cocaine and 20 times as much heroine to get that sentence. 70% of all drug  users are white. 80% of crack users are black. Federal Mandatory Minimums for crack  users are a war on the black community. "
11075,c.j.,"Oh please. Katie, you have a question."
11076,c.j.,"The White House is committed to reversing the devastating affects of drug abuse in our  society. We believe the best way to do that is to treat drug addiction as what the AMA  has said it is, which is a medical problem. We do not believe in a phony war on drugs.  The chief accomplishment of which would be to either kill or incarcerate black drug users. "
11077,c.j.,Steve Onorato is saying the White House supports legalization? 
11078,c.j.,"How surprising that in the midst of an important debate the President would be accused  of being soft on drugs. Steve Onorato has a memo written by the Assistant Surgeon General.  I’d be happy to produce similar memos written for every President in the last thirty years,  including four Republicans. That’s all, thank you everybody."
11079,c.j.,It was a ridiculous question.
11080,c.j.,Is the White House crusading for the rights of drug users? You know that’s not what I meant.
11081,c.j.,"Oh, so you were just helping out."
11084,c.j.,"They talk about it here, Danny. They talk about it here."
11087,c.j., I have to go back to work.
11088,c.j.,"Call the phone banks, check in with the poll."
11101,c.j.,Yeah... I’m going to the phone banks to check in with the poll.
11103,c.j.,"Leo, this is a small thing and I hate to bring it up."
11105,c.j.,"I was in with the President this morning, AND he mentioned that you told him that when  you asked for predictions, everyone said we’d hold steady at 42. "
11107,c.j.,"But, I didn’t say that. I said we’d go up five points."
11111,c.j.,"Leo, it wasn’t woman’s intuition. I think it’s strange...."
11113,c.j.,I’m saying its strange my take wasn’t...
11117,c.j.,"No, I’m going to check the phone banks."
11118,josh,Theodore Roosevelt said...
11119,josh,Let me tell you what Theodore Roosevelt said.
11120,josh,Because the Republicans are going to bring it up.
11121,josh,"He said, ""We have room for but one language here, and that is the English language.  For we intend to see that the crucible turns our people out as Americans, and not as  dwellers in a polyglot boarding house."""
11122,josh,Polyglot. It means... ah... having knowledge of or speaking... 
11123,josh,They why did you ask me?
11125,josh,Mandy’s wound a little tight during polling windows.
11126,c.j., What are you all doing here?
11127,josh,Here’s another laid-back member of our team.
11128,c.j.,What are you all doing here?
11129,josh,Mandy’s here cause she’s suppose to be. Joey’s here because Al Kiefer told her to stop by...
11130,c.j.,And what are you doing here?
11131,josh,I’m kind of in charge of morale.
11133,josh,The calls are going great.
11134,c.j.,"I’m trying to meet a deadline, Josh. I’ve got a 48-hour window and you can’t stand here  distracting the female callers. "
11135,josh, Have I been distracting the female callers? 
11138,c.j.,This is what I’m saying.
11139,josh,The window’s fine. It’s a good response rate. They’re making their quotas. Stop bothering me.
11140,c.j.,Did Josh mention he’s in charge of morale?
11141,josh,"Yes, I am. And as such, I’m going out to get coffee for everyone ‘cause a few hundred  volts of caffeine is just what the doctor ordered around here.   And you should’ve been more impressed that I was able to quote Theodore Roosevelt."
11142,josh,"760 S.A.T. word, baby. "
11156,toby,"He said, ""Get your ass over here."""
11158,toby,"Well you’re not going to give it to him, Sam, because that would deny me the pleasure  of throwing you out through a plate glass window."
11160,toby,Thank you for acknowledging that right.
11162,toby,"I should keep you on a leash, you know that?"
11165,toby,Ten-foot chain around your neck. I bolt you to your desk and have someone come in and  feed you.
11166,c.j.," Not the DOW Industrials, the NASDAQ composite."
11170,c.j.,We didn’t know anything last night. 
11172,c.j.,That’s right. He met the girl and saw a suspicious car. I’m not going to call up the  White House Chief of Staff in the middle of the night because someone started a car.
11174,c.j.,"I was handling it, Leo. It took me three hours to confirm there was a picture, and  another hour to find out who has it. "
11176,c.j.,"The London Daily Mirror. They paid a waitress friend of hers $50,000 to set it up and  confirm that she was a call girl."
11178,c.j.,It’ll run later today. American Press has it tomorrow morning. 
11183,bartlet,You never paid this girl to have sex?
11185,toby,"They didn’t have that kind of relationship, sir. Except once, and that time he didn’t  know what was happening."
11186,bartlet,"Well, that makes two of us."
11187,toby,"Mr. President, Sam has always been completely above board about his relationship with Laurie."
11190,toby,"He told us about it right after his first contact with her nine months ago. The fact that  she was putting herself through law school, under circumstances that were less than good,  has to mean something, as is the fact that Sam’s word is unimpeachable."
11191,bartlet,"Toby, are you in here sticking up for Sam?"
11192,toby,"I know it’s strange, sir. But I’m feeling a-a... certain big brotherly connection right  now. You know, obviously, I’d like that feeling to go away as soon as possible. But for  the moment, I think there’s no danger in the White House standing by Sam and aggressively  going after the people who set him up."
11193,bartlet," Sam, you’re going to spend the morning in the White House Counsel’s office  finding out if you’ve broke any laws."
11195,bartlet,You should also call the girl... what’s her name?
11197,bartlet,You should call her and tell her the White House deeply regrets the phenomenal inconvenience  she’s about to experience.
11199,bartlet,You might also want to point out to her that she probably has a cause of action against  the paper.
11201,bartlet,"And you should tell her that if she passes her Bar exam, the U.S. Attorney General will  personally see to it that she’s admitted to the Bar."
11203,bartlet,Tell her the President of the United States says congratulations on getting her degree.
11207,bartlet,"It’s nice when we can do something for prostitutes once in a while, isn’t it?"
11210,bartlet,Where are we putting Lobell and his people?
11211,bartlet,He’s going to have a lot of staff with him.
11213,bartlet,"I don’t know what any of them do, but there they are where ever Lobell goes, 14-15 guys...."
11214,bartlet,I’m going to take care of this first and I’ll see you across the hall.
11215,toby,"Thank you, Mr. President. "
11216,bartlet,Who’s in the Mural room?
11218,bartlet,"When you said the name ‘Cochran’, it was like you knew him. "
11219,bartlet,I have a sense about these things.
11221,bartlet,Cochran’s in the Mural room?
11222,bartlet,Why don’t you go sit with him and send in Ted Mitchell.
11224,bartlet,"Yes, of course.  Thank you."
11229,bartlet,"All right, listen. I have something to do in the next room. Let me just tell you that  I need a favor."
11230,bartlet,I need you to hire a guy.
11231,bartlet,A former ambassador to Bulgaria.
11233,bartlet,"Not for long. Look, he’s a good man, a smart man; I think he’d make a very good corporate  officer."
11234,bartlet,Gross incompetence. I’ll be right back.
11236,bartlet,"Yeah, I’ll be right in."
11238,bartlet,Thank you for flying in on such short notice.
11240,bartlet,"You’ve been having an affair with the daughter of the Prime Minister and that doesn’t  work for me. But neither does the newspaper article saying you’re having an affair with  the daughter of the Prime Minister. So, I need you to resign. You’re going to get a job  offer from Ted Mitchell for a lot more money than you’re making now, that’s why you left  the Embassy. I’ll be back in a minute."
11242,bartlet,"It doesn’t have anything to do with... Oh, wait a second. You two have a past?"
11243,bartlet,You mocked my finely honed sense.
11244,bartlet,You stood there in my face...
11245,bartlet,"It’s done Ken. Ted Mitchell’s going to put you on the Board of Directors, and please  remember that I have a lot of affection for your wife, and I would hate to see her be  made a fool of."
11247,bartlet,"Well, thanks for trying, but here I am anyway. Got to go."
11249,bartlet,Look at that. 14 staffers in there.
11250,toby,"You have quite a huge staff, too, Mr. President."
11251,bartlet,"Yeah, but I don’t walk around with them, you know?"
11253,bartlet,"Max, I don’t need to know all the names. It’s okay. Please, sit down."
11254,bartlet,"You know what we’re doing here, right?"
11255,bartlet,We’re going to do more than talk about it.
11256,bartlet,"We agree on nothing, Max."
11257,bartlet,"Education, guns, drugs, school prayer, gays, defense spending, taxes, you name it,  we disagree."
11258,bartlet,"‘Cause I’m a lily-livered, bleeding-heart, liberal, egg head, communist."
11260,bartlet,We also agree on campaign finance.
11262,bartlet,Let’s work together on campaign finance.
11263,bartlet,"I don’t need them. 1978, the FEC voted a regulatory rule that opened the door to soft  money. The FEC can close it again with 4 of the 6 votes. We don’t need a law."
11264,bartlet,"Two seats opened up, I nominated Bacon and Calhoun."
11265,bartlet,Barry Haskel was with us already. We took him out of the closet. 
11266,bartlet,"Toby’s going to take care of that right away. Max, can I count on your support to confirm  my candidates?"
11267,bartlet, The thanks of a grateful President.
11272,toby,The President thinks you’ve done an excellent job on the Federal Election Commission  and would like to extend his warmest congratulations.
11273,toby,On being named the next ambassador to the Federated States of Micronesia.
11277,c.j.,"They sealed it in an envelope, sent it by courier."
11278,josh,"So, Joey mentioned she talked to you."
11280,josh,"She said, ""You think you only have so many times left you can walk into the Oval Office  and sing a song."""
11281,c.j.,"She said, ""Sing a song""?"
11282,josh,"No, that’s what I thought she said. I’m trying to pick up some sign and right now we’re  doing it by letters of the alphabet. So I had Kenny come over and interpret it, and it  turns out she said ""you think you only have so many times left you can come into the  Oval Office and say you’re wrong."" "
11283,c.j.,"He hasn’t been calling my number that much, Josh."
11284,josh,"He did on this. This last three weeks, the media strategy was yours."
11286,josh,You should listen to Joey. Holding at 42 is a good number. You shouldn’t expect a  five-point bump.
11288,josh,"Okay.  He thinks of you like a daughter, C.J."
11289,c.j.,That’s not a good enough reason to keep me here.
11290,josh,You’ll come as soon as you get it?
11292,josh,Cause we’re all waiting over there.
11300,toby,He’s gonna be an ambassador; he feels pretty good.
11301,bartlet,Did you tell him about the weather?
11305,bartlet,Full diplomatic immunity?
11306,toby,"Yes sir. Though, there really aren’t a... a lot of laws in Micronesia, sir."
11310,josh,I just saw C.J. She’ll be here with it in a minute.
11312,josh,Joey and I have been working on a counter argument to Alexis de Tocqueville.
11313,bartlet,We’re having a fight with Alexis de Tocqueville?
11314,josh,"Joey, what say you to the position that with ethnic warfare spreading around the globe,  and in particularly in Eastern Europe, it’s only a matter of time before it reaches our  shores and making English the official language of the United States will safeguard  against the destruction of our national identity and help us avoid ethnic strife? What  say you to that?"
11315,josh,You see that? That’s what I’ve been dealing with all week.
11316,josh,"Okay, that’s all I was looking for, that one line. Took you four days."
11319,bartlet,"What kind of briefcase did you get her, Sam?"
11321,bartlet,What kind of briefcase?
11325,bartlet,"Andare makes a nice model. Comes in black or brown, hand stained, fit a laptop, notebooks,  the works."
11326,toby,This conversation is surreal.
11327,bartlet,Trieste in Milan makes a nice briefcase.
11328,c.j.,"Good evening, Mr. President. The full polling book is 400 pages long and it’s still  being put together. I have the top sheet results."
11330,c.j.,I was wrong. We went up nine points.
11333,bartlet,"I don’t think I answered the last one. Suzanne’s got me telling jokes. Here’s an answer  to your question that I don’t think you’re going to like the current crop of 18-25 year  olds is the most politically apathetic generation in American history. In 1972, half of  that age group voted. In the last election, 32%. Your generation is considerably less  likely than any previous one to write or call public officials, attend rallies, or work  on political campaigns. A man once said this, ""decisions are made by those who show up.""  So are we failing you, or are you failing us? It's a little of both.  "
11334,bartlet,". . .there’s a guy on my staff who showed me a report from the Center of Policy  Alternatives that said 61% of your age group agree with the statement ""Politicians  and political officials - "
11335,josh,The Center of Policy Alternatives. C.J. will have copies for the bus ride back. 
11345,josh,"It’s the signal for this thing, now. "
11347,josh,"It happened just... who cares, Leo? It’s the signal for this thing, now. "
11349,josh,Go tell the President. 
11353,c.j.,I have a tip and I’m going to give it to you before the others. 
11356,c.j.,I want you to acknowledge that I’m doing something nice for you. 
11357,c.j.,A peace pipe of sorts. 
11358,c.j.,"An offering, in one sense. "
11359,c.j.,Call your science editor. 
11360,c.j.,It’s about the Space Shuttle Columbia. 
11361,bartlet,"Generation x advocacy group third millennium, 53 of 18 to 25 year olds believe the soap  opera General Hospital will outlast Medicare. This from a generation convinced that the  generation before them has ransomed their generation’s future. That’s why my youngest  daughter Zoey is always mad at me. "
11362,bartlet,"This is the part where Zoey tries to crawl under a seat to hide. Don’t worry about it,  sweetie, I’ll bring out the baby pictures any second now. "
11375,bartlet,"It seems to me that if this event is over by 10:00, then I can be back here by 11, and  you know what that means. "
11376,bartlet,Did you just snicker when you said that? 
11378,bartlet,"Thanks, Lou.  When you said Girls Softball Game, you snickered. "
11379,bartlet,"Yes, you snickered. As if to indicate there was something wrong with my wanting to see a  girls’ softball game live via satellite."
11380,bartlet,"Thanks, Phil.  I am excited about it! You come  to the end of a long day, you sit back, you open a beer, you watch a sporting event.  That’s what men do."
11381,bartlet,"If that’s what’s on, then that’s what they watch. It’s either that, or a cricket match  between Scotland and Bermuda. Now, I am an educated man, Charlie, but when someone tries  to explain cricket to me, all I want to do is hit him in the head with a teapot. "
11382,bartlet,"Good morning, Patty.  So, it’s softball. Sacramento State versus the  University of the Pacific."
11383,bartlet,"Now, you’re not going to spoil my fun. "
11384,bartlet,"I’m going to get back at the end of the day, sit back, open a beer..."
11386,bartlet,"Hey, Steve. Hey, Mikey.  Listen, have I got any of the names right so far? "
11388,bartlet,"Good morning, everybody! "
11389,c.j., I hope you don’t mind if we get right to it. 
11391,c.j.,"It’s a town hall meeting broadcast live on MSNBC. For the purposes of this rehearsal,  Carol will be the moderator, she’ll be seated at your right, which is camera left.  You’ll have a pitcher and a drinking glass. "
11392,bartlet,"And when I speak, I should stand facing the audience, right? "
11394,bartlet,"Do you know how I know this, C.J.? Because I’ve done it 2,000 to 300,000 times before.   Hey, Sam. "
11396,bartlet,Why didn’t the Columbia land last night? 
11398,bartlet,"The Space Shuttle was supposed to land last night, someone told me that it didn’t. "
11400,bartlet,Why don’t you go ask Toby? 
11402,bartlet,His brother’s on that flight. 
11404,bartlet,He’s a payload specialist. 
11406,bartlet,"He’s up there with four red-bellied Japanese newts. He wants to see how a newt’s inner  ears, which are remarkably similar to humans, are influenced by the absence of gravity.   Do you know what he calls them, C.J.? "
11408,bartlet,100% right.  Go ask him why it didn’t land. 
11411,bartlet,"C.J., you say I have a pitcher of water and a drinking glass. Now the water gets into  the glass how? "
11412,toby,"And the question will go something like this, Mr. President, your administration has  pursued a policy of, what? Constructive engagement..."
11413,toby,"...towards China, even though it’s a communist country that has systemically, what,  imprisoned dissidents..."
11414,toby,"Okay, oppressed blah, blah, blah. At the same time, your administration has refused to  engage Cuba. Why the double standard? "
11417,toby,"We need an answer on Cuba. We need an answer on Cuba, and we need an answer on farm loans. "
11419,toby,There will be faculty there. 
11427,toby,"What do you want from me, Sam? Is there something going on on the shuttle? "
11429,toby,Thank you. And write me the answer on Cuba. 
11433,josh,Did you get me the meeting with the Vice President? 
11437,josh,"We couldn’t really, this time, just sit in chairs? "
11439,josh,"Okay, order me boiled chicken and some pasta. Nothing like a meeting you have to carb-up  for. "
11441,josh," Yeah, I’m headed to the Press Room. "
11448,josh,The chair I sit in at my desk. 
11452,josh,"Yeah, you call up a guy in maintenance, he uses a screwdriver. "
11454,josh,I didn’t even know there was a shop. 
11462,josh,And how much is Curtis charging the Federal Government to fix the wobbly wheel on my  chair? 
11468,bartlet,I wouldn’t say my administration is nibbling around the edges. 
11469,josh,"Don’t repeat the phrase, sir, that will be the soundbite. If we don’t have a solution,  the least we can do is acknowledge that there is a problem. "
11470,bartlet,"I agree with you that far too many Americans don’t have adequate access to health  insurance, and that far too many of them are children. Yes, we can and we must do more. "
11472,bartlet,Hang on.  Now can I blame Congress? 
11475,bartlet,Is the pilot still alive? 
11476,bartlet,He’s in the middle of nowhere. 
11478,bartlet,Our guy is ten miles from the Fourth Corps of the Iraqi Republican Guard? 
11486,bartlet,The pilot. What’s his name? 
11489,bartlet,"Rob told me in my intelligence briefing last week that the Iraqi government has put out  a bounty the equivalent of 14,000 dollars U.S on any American plane shot down, or any  American soldier captured. Now, he was just patrolling the No Fly zone, right? "
11491,bartlet,"Bill, if it ends up that Fitzwallace has to call this kid’s parents, I swear to God I’m  invading Baghdad.  Get him back. "
11494,c.j.,Is the pilot still alive? 
11496,c.j.,Is there a Pentagon...?
11498,c.j.,Is there a rescue mission? 
11500,c.j.,"If the Iraqis shot down an F-117, they’re going to want to tell the world about it. "
11502,c.j.,"There’s going to be film of a burning airplane on CNN within two hours, and the press  will have the news before you get done with whatever it is you’ve got going on in the  situation room. "
11510,c.j.,"I wasn’t lying to the press about India/Pakistan, I was lied to by you, which made me  look like an idiot. "
11512,c.j.,We’re going to pay a price for misleading the press. 
11518,josh,"An F-117 is a stealth fighter, right? "
11520,josh,"At some point, we’re going to be talking about how they shot down a stealth fighter. "
11522,josh,"Anyway, I arranged a meeting with Hoynes. "
11528,josh,I’m not worried about the meeting. 
11533,josh,I’m sure that someone is looking into that. 
11535,josh,"In it’s defense, the stealth fighter is a generation of technology behind the B-2 Spirit  Bomber. "
11536,toby,"It’s a stealth fighter, it should have stealth capability, right? "
11538,toby,"Because if it doesn’t, we should call it something else. "
11544,toby,"Sam, if your ass isn’t off my desk, and I mean stat..."
11546,toby,A payload bay door wouldn’t close? 
11548,toby,It’s morning every 45 minutes on the shuttle. 
11550,toby,It’s morning right now. 
11552,toby,"Well, it’s a red-letter day for U.S. Aviation, isn’t it? "
11554,toby,"All right, then go back to work. C.J.’s going to need the briefing room, so let’s move  prep to the Roosevelt Room as soon as the President is free. "
11556,toby,"Okay.  Sam? Keep in touch with Peter Jobson and let me know as  soon as it lands, would you? "
11560,josh,"There was a reckless deregulation of the S&L industry by a Democratic Congress, it was  flooded with S&L donations. A disaster which nearly collapsed the banking industry and  cost the taxpayers 500 billion dollars. "
11561,josh,We’re no better with the money than they are. 
11562,josh,"Three-quarters of all soft money coming to the Democratic party isn’t coming from labor  unions, it’s coming from corporations. "
11563,josh,"Over a hundred businesses gave both parties in excess of $125,000 in the last election. "
11564,josh,"They gave it to both parties! This isn’t free speech or political values, Mr. Vice  President. I don’t know how we’ve done it, but we’ve legalized bribery. "
11565,josh,"So, now what we’ve got is two corporate parties - one pro-life, one pro-choice. "
11566,josh,We’ve noticed the sudden increase in racquetball and late-night poker games with  democratic opponents of campaign finance reform. 
11567,josh,"Can we stop running for a second?  You’re backing the wrong horse.  You read the same polls I do. President’s gone up nine points in three weeks. 51% job  approval - big deal. But he’s going on national television tonight, that’s going to be  another 5 that’s 56%, a 14-point bump in a month. "
11568,josh,"Hang on. If we bring this pilot back home alive, that’s another 10 points. And then  we’re off to the races with a job approval rating in the high 60s. Now every Democratic  congressman in a tight race is looking to get his picture taken with the president,  and you’re looking around the racquetball court, saying, ""Where did everybody go?""  You’ve had some experience battling Jed Bartlet when he’s right, and you’ve had some  experience battling him when he’s popular. Why in the world would you want to try it  when he’s both at the same time? "
11569,josh,"No sir, I know it for sure.  I’m done. Thank you for your time, sir. "
11570,c.j.,"Good Afternoon. A U.S. Air Force F-117-A Nighthawk Stealth fighter attack aircraft flying a routine patrol out of Al Jabar Air Force Base in Kuwait was shot down over the southern no-fly zone in Iraq. At this point, we don’t know the condition of the pilot. We do know  that the plane does carry an ACES II 0/0 ejector seat, and that is was activated. General  Richmond and General Clancy will talk more about that in a moment. "
11572,c.j.,"Obviously there are a number of scenarios being contemplated, but I wouldn’t want to  speculate. "
11573,c.j.,"We have been in touch with the Iraqi government, and the President is looking for a  diplomatic solution. "
11576,bartlet,Expanding healthcare coverage for 5 million more poor children. 
11577,bartlet,Making healthcare portable for people who change jobs. 
11578,bartlet,"You know what’s hard about all this, C.J.? "
11580,bartlet,"I’m rehearsing here without the pitcher and glass, it’s totally weird for me. "
11586,bartlet,"No, because with the mike and the stool, and the jacket thrown over my shoulder,  and I can do the town hall meeting, and then do a couple of sets at the Copa. "
11587,bartlet,"My musical director, Zoey Bartlet. "
11588,bartlet,We’re down to do I or do I not take my jacket off. 
11589,bartlet,"I honestly couldn’t care less. Listen, I want you to come with us tonight. "
11593,bartlet,"Are you channeling Mom, now? "
11594,bartlet,Come to Virginia tonight. 
11595,bartlet,It’s not like being there in person. 
11596,bartlet,Bonus. Then it’s settled. 
11598,bartlet,And you’re coming tonight. 
11600,bartlet,"All right, everyone, we’re done. Thanks very much. "
11601,bartlet,"Charlie, Zoey said you had something you wanted to mention? "
11602,bartlet,Zoey said you had something you wanted to mention. 
11610,bartlet,What kind of signal did you have in mind? 
11617,bartlet,"Well, I think it’s going to get around all by itself, but if you want to help it along  a little, there’s nothing wrong with that. "
11634,josh,They’re going to torture him. This is to say nothing of the 80 guys in a helicopter who  are going to get shot at if they’re picked up underneath the radar. 
11644,josh,It looked like you wanted to hug me. 
11648,josh,"Yeah, for if we know something during the town hall. "
11656,josh,"It’s, uh, a plane taking off. "
11658,josh,  This means something good has happened. 
11660,josh,You don’t have to be a cryptographer. 
11662,josh,Leo. I really do apologize. 
11665,josh,"You can keep fighting in just a second, I just need to find something. "
11671,toby,Come in. What do you know? 
11677,toby,Do you know if they have primary RCS? 
11684,toby,"Before, when you first asked me, the reason I reacted the way I didI was just embarrassed. Cause honestly, I forgot he was up there. They had switched his mission order around a  couple of times and I just lost track of it. "
11688,bartlet,"No. Hey, what was it that Zoey was talking about before? "
11694,bartlet,"Charlie, whatever it is, stick it in my briefcase, would you? "
11696,bartlet,"Fitz, do you have any news at all?"
11702,bartlet,"I honestly don’t know, Fitz."
11705,bartlet,"Well, that’s, that’s a job awfully well done, Mr. Chairman. "
11707,bartlet,"All the same, I’m going to check out that thing with the carpet. "
11708,bartlet,"Seriously, I’m going to get an answer for you on that. "
11709,bartlet,"Captain Hutchins, this is President Bartlet. How’s your ankle? Good. Now before you say  another word, give me your parents’ phone number. I never get to make this call.  "
11710,c.j.,"Radar officers aboard the Minneapolis monitored Captain Hutchins as his plane went what  is called ""Feet Dry"" south of the 33rd parallel. "
11712,c.j.,"We did use Saudi airspace, we flew secretly on the way in, they were informed of the  mission on the way out. "
11713,c.j.,That’s when the British were told.
11714,c.j.,"Folks, it’s a few minutes after seven. Most of us have to pile into buses to get over to  Arlington. All this material will be covered in much greater detail at the Pentagon  briefing, which will take place 30 minutes after our return. That’s all for now. "
11715,c.j.,"I have to congratulate you, Carol. I was afraid I was going to see Saudi Arabia spelled  with a ‘y’. "
11716,c.j.,"Yes. One ""l"" in Tel Aviv. "
11718,c.j.,"Danny, I don’t even want to hear it. I did exactly the right thing. Your nose is bent out  of joint, and I don’t give a damn. "
11720,c.j.,"What did you think I was going to do, Danny? Give you longitude and latitude? Did you  think I was going to fork over the radio frequency that we’re transmitting on?"
11722,c.j.,"Danny, if by standing up and lying, I misdirected Iraqi intelligence for even half a  beat, then it was absolutely worth it. That’s a no-brainer. And if I didn’t, it was  certainly worth trying. There were only 50 people in the world who can’t understand why  I lied this morning, and they all work in the White House pressroom. I’m sleeping fine  tonight. "
11725,c.j.,"Danny, I got to tell you, that was, seriously, that was a turn-on when you said that,  though I don’t know why you decided to be the most haughty on the Dallas Morning News. "
11726,c.j., The buses are leaving. 
11728,bartlet,Womens' softball. It’s going to be great. Mrs. Landingham? I’m watching a live sporting  event from beginning to end tonight. 
11729,bartlet,"You’re not going to spoil my good time for me, Mrs. Landingham. "
11731,bartlet,Do you see me walking out the door?
11734,bartlet," You know what, I'll be at the car in just a second. "
11739,toby,"Excuse me, Mr. President. I’m sorry. "
11740,bartlet,"You can’t see them, they’re over Australia now. I just spoke with the mission commander.  They’re trying firing something called an RCS? "
11741,toby,"Yeah, it’s the reaction control system. It’s actually 40 separate engines around the  shuttle. "
11742,bartlet,"If that doesn’t work, they’ve got about 39 other things they can try. There’s redundancy  after redundancy after redundancy built in. And for good measure, they have Atlantis  warming up on the launch pad. It can dock with the Columbia in about two hours. We can  do that now, Toby. "
11743,toby,"First thing the shuttle does after it leaves the atmosphere is open the cargo bay doors.  That’s what lets the heat out. Once those doors close, they have a pretty short window to  get back before it overheats. "
11744,bartlet,Then they’ll open those doors again. 
11746,bartlet,Same way they closed them - with a five-dollar wrench. 
11748,bartlet,"When we’re done tonight, you should take the next flight out to Edwards’ Air Force Base,  meet the thing when it lands, stop being a horse’s ass, and talk to your brother. "
11749,toby,"Mr. President. I appreciate you trying to be a comfort, and I appreciate that you have  some understanding of the situation with my brother. But the thing was supposed to land  19 hours ago. Obviously, there’s a problem. It’s space travel, and I don’t believe any  problem is minor. "
11750,bartlet,"Shuttle flies itself, Toby. "
11751,toby,"No, it doesn’t, Mr. President. "
11753,bartlet,"Thank you, thank you very much. That was a joke about politicians.   Two politicians are having an argument. The first one yells, 'but you’re lying!' and the  other one answers, ‘yes, I know, but hear me out!"" "
11754,bartlet,"I don’t think I answered the last one. Suzanne’s got me telling jokes. Here’s an answer  to your question that I don’t think you’re going to like. A man once said this,  ""decisions are made by those who show up."" So are we failing you, or are you failing us?   A little of both. There’s a guy on my staff named Charlie Young, he showed  me a report from the Center of Policy Alternatives that says that 61% of you agree with  the statement ""The older generation has failed my generation"". When asked how the older  generation sees you, your top answers are ""lazy"", ""confused,"" and ""unfocused"". "
11755,josh,Center for Policy Alternatives. C.J. will have copies for you on the bus ride back. 
11756,bartlet,"If I take my jacket off, can I trust you all to read nothing more into it than I’ve been  talking for two hours and it’s a little hot under these lights? "
11762,bartlet,"They’re telling me that we’re out of time. I just want to mention that at several points  during the evening, I was referred to as both a liberal and a populist, and a fellow  fourth from the back called me a socialist, which is nice, I haven’t heard that for a  while. "
11763,bartlet,"...and announced to the world that we were no longer subjects of King George III, but  rather a self-governing people. We hold these truths to be self-evident, they said,  that all men are created equal. Strange as it may seem, that was the first time in  history that anyone had bothered to write that down. Decisions are made by those who  show up. Class dismissed. Thank you, everyone. God bless you. And God bless America. "
11767,bartlet,What have you got to say for yourself? 
11771,bartlet,"Get her on the radio, please!"
11778,bartlet,Why isn’t Gina in the car?
11779,bartlet,Is anybody dead back there?
11780,bartlet,What happened to your hand?!
11781,bartlet,"Oh God.  Coop, turn around, we gotta go to the hospital."
11782,bartlet,We’re going to the hospital! Let’s go!
11783,bartlet,"This is... my daughter is throwing up on the floor in the car behind us. You’re losing  blood by the liter, not to mention how many broken bones you got in your hand, but let’s  make sure that I’m tucked in bed before we do anything..."
11785,c.j.,I hit my head on the ground.
11786,c.j.,Somebody pulled me down.
11793,c.j.,"Yeah, where’s the President?"
11795,c.j.,Somebody pulled me down.
11798,toby,"Hey, Charlie, are you okay?"
11800,toby,"No, he didn’t. Shanahan got in with Leo. Josh didn’t get in the car."
11801,toby,Yeah. Stay right there.
11802,toby,Josh! Didn’t you hear me shouting for you? I didn’t know where the hell you... 
11803,toby,I need a... I need a doctor! I need help!
11806,bartlet,"I swear to God if I don’t speak to my daughter in the next five minutes, I’m gonna attack  someone."
11807,bartlet," This guy’s got about seven broken bones in his hand, by the way.  If somebody wants to give him an aspirin or something..."
11808,bartlet,"Listen, I want you to wait as long as you can before you give me the anesthesia. I need to  speak to Leo McGarry before you give me the anesthesia."
11809,bartlet,Well... I’ve been shot.
11811,bartlet,They didn’t hit anything. They’re just gonna look around and make sure.
11813,bartlet,"Yeah, ‘cause I want these guys to tell reporters that I was brave and joking around."
11814,bartlet," Honey, I’m fine. I’m just so happy to see you."
11815,bartlet,Mom’s gonna be pretty pissed.
11817,bartlet,She booted all over the back of her car. You know they’re gonna bill me for that.
11819,bartlet,"Honey, do me a favor, will you?"
11820,bartlet,Tell her not to frighten the doctors. I’ll see you in a couple hours.
11822,bartlet,Anybody killed back there?
11828,bartlet, Get the cabinet together and the Security Council. Tell Jerome to suspend trading  on the stock exchange.
11830,bartlet,Do we know who the shooters were?
11832,bartlet,I’m gonna be under anesthesia for a couple hours.
11834,bartlet,"You know what I’m talking about, right?"
11860,josh,I shouldn’t be at this meeting.
11863,josh,I shouldn’t be at this meeting.
11864,josh,I need to get to New Hampshire.
11867,josh,"A few hundred times, sir."
11868,josh,"Of the 537 federal election officials, there are 30 who put their names on Social Security  reform legislation, and you’re one of them. Why not say so?"
11869,josh,"Mark, 400 billion dollars. Social Security represents one-fourth of the federal budget,  and it’s gonna be bankrupt in exactly 17 years. Right around the time you’re going to  check your mailbox, half of the elderly population will be living in poverty. This now,  qualifies as a priority, and running for President of the United States not putting Social  Security front and center is like running for President of the Walt Disney Corporation by  saying you’re gonna fix the rides at Epcot. "
11870,josh,Really? ‘Cause it’s what the rest of us call bull--
11871,josh,I don’t think the point of this is for me to have...
11872,josh,"Senator, you’re the prohibitive favorite to be the Democratic Party’s nominee for  President. You have 58 million dollars in war chest with no end in sight, and...  I don’t know what we’re for."
11873,josh,"I don’t know what we’re for, and I don’t know what we’re against. Except we seem to be  for winning and against somebody else winning."
11878,josh,"Of course, I don’t mind, but the senator just went down for the 404 vote."
11890,josh,Yeah. They put... they got it all this time.
11892,josh,"No. He goes to the office at seven in the morning and goes home at eight every night.  On the weekends, he cleans the gutters and yells at the squirrels."
11894,josh,‘Cause they eat the seeds out of the bird feeder.
11896,josh,"He knows, but he prefers to admonish them. But, listen, I-I need to get back to this  meeting."
11898,josh,I work for Senator Hoynes.
11902,josh,"Look, Hoynes has the nomination sewn up."
11904,josh,"And if Bartlet’s looking to be Treasury Secretary or a slot at the Convention, this  really isn’t..."
11910,josh,"Leo, the-the Democrats aren’t gonna nominate another liberal academic former governor  from New England. I mean, we’re dumb, but we’re not that dumb."
11912,josh," Yeah, uh, Janet. Uh, I need you to set up some plane tickets to New York.  Uh, probably to Boston too..."
11927,josh,It’s 9:30 in the morning.
11930,josh,"Yeah, I was going to call before I came here, but then the strangest thing happened."
11932,josh,I forgot the name of your firm.
11942,josh,"I really do know Gage Whitney. I’m saying, I’m just, um, I’m um, having a brain problem."
11944,josh,I’m on my way to Nashua.
11946,josh,"Ah, a waste of time. Listen. You know why I’m here."
11950,josh,A better campaign. Come do some speech writing.
11954,josh,"Okay. Listen, I should go, I got to go. I should let you--"
11958,josh,"Hey, congratulations on that partnership."
11961,josh,"See, that-the thing you gotta know about Hoynes is-- "
11965,josh,I don’t know. What are you doing?
11968,josh,I can’t believe no one ever wrote a folk song about that. 
11969,josh,"If I see the real thing in Nashua, should I tell you about it?"
11999,c.j.,The President’s going to be fine.
12002,toby,He was shot--in the chest.
12003,c.j.,He’s in surgery right now.
12005,toby,"Yes, it’s critical. The bullet collapsed his lung and damaged a major artery."
12006,c.j.,"Leo’s gonna meet with the leadership in ten minutes. When he’s done, I’ll talk to  the press."
12008,c.j.,"Dr. Keller, the head surgeon, and Admiral Jarvis, the President's personal physician,  will be debriefing you in a few hours."
12012,c.j.,I'll get back to you on that.
12015,c.j.,I don't have anything for you on that.
12016,c.j.,I don't have anything for you on that either.
12017,c.j.,I don't believe the AP knows more than I do; I just believe they're willing to tell you  more.
12020,c.j.,It's policy not to comment on security procedures.
12022,c.j., There'll be another briefing in an hour and a half. Hopefully we'll know more then.
12023,c.j., What's that supposed to mean since you can't answer my question?
12025,c.j.,I lost my necklace. It must have come off when.
12026,c.j.,Somebody pushed me down.
12029,c.j.,"The Vice President, the Secretary of State, the National Security Advisor, the Secretary  of Defense, one of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the White House Chief of Staff."
12031,c.j.,You understand I'm talking about the hockey team.
12032,c.j.,Just... give me a little time.
12038,toby,He's gotta sign a letter giving the Vice President power?
12039,toby,He's hemorrhaging and he's supposed to draft a memo?
12040,c.j.,I'm getting questions from Danny Concannon on it.
12041,c.j.,Let's assume I haven't.
12042,c.j.,And what does 'principal assistant' mean?
12043,toby,"Of course it wouldn't, 'cause that's an area of federal law where he'd want to have as  much ambiguity as possible."
12045,c.j.,I'm gonna go back to the hospital.
12047,toby,Try and hold Danny off for a few hours until the Counsel's office tells us where we are.
12049,toby,You scratched your neck.
12052,c.j.,"Yeah, it's where my necklace. Listen, Toby, I've been getting some questions about the  canopy the Secret Service used to use for outdoor entrances and exits."
12054,c.j.,"It was. Arthur Leeds, then a couple of others stopped me."
12056,c.j.,We don't comment on security procedures.
12058,c.j.,So I don't think I'll have to answer that question.
12061,toby,I'll see you at the hospital.
12063,toby,I need section 202 of the National Securities Act of 1947. 
12064,toby,Hey Ginger. I didn't know you were here.
12065,toby,It's okay.  Come here. 
12072,toby,"Yeah, we kept that secret pretty good. You know, he's speaking at the VFW hall tonight.  You should come."
12073,toby,There'll be free chicken.
12074,toby,Professional political operative.
12075,toby,"Well, there was a while back there when I was in elementary school."
12079,toby,"Including city council, two Congressional elections, a senate race, a Gubernatorial  campaign, and a national campaign? "
12081,toby,You gotta be impressed with my consistency.
12083,toby,Cause I'm about to get fired.
12084,toby,It was nice meeting you. 
12085,bartlet,"...Consumer price index, we tend to be late in responding to these trends, and we get  what doctors call a ""false positive"". The science of economics is a lot less an exact  science that we pretend. We build complex models with thousands of interdependent and  independent variables."
12093,toby,I have no new information since the last time you asked me that question.
12094,bartlet,"Let me put it another way: you and your husband pay $600 more every year than you would  if you were unmarried, living together, and filing individually. Couples living outside  the covenant of marriage do so."
12095,toby,"I asked him about his vote, he told me, I said then if he's asked about it tonight he  should and only because it's the easiest thing to remember, tell the truth."
12096,toby,"Not that much, but then I haven't had much to compare it to so..."
12097,bartlet,...which then again is a much larger tax on overstated real profits.
12098,bartlet,"You really didn't understand any of that, right?"
12100,bartlet," Yeah, I screwed you on that one."
12101,bartlet,I screwed you. You got hosed.
12102,bartlet,"And not just you. A lot of my constituents. I put the hammer to farms in Concord, Salem,  Laconia, and Elem."
12103,bartlet,You guys got rogered but good.
12104,bartlet,"Today, for the first time in history, one in five Americans living in poverty are children."
12105,bartlet,"One in five children live in the most abject, dangerous, hopeless, backbreaking, gut  wrenching, poverty, one in five, and they're children. If fidelity to freedom and  democracy is the code of our civic religion then surely, the code of our humanity is  faithful service to that unwritten commandment that says ""We shall give our children  better than we ourselves had."" I voted against the bill 'cause I didn't want it to be  hard for people to buy milk. I stopped some money from flowing into your pocket. If that  angers you, if you resent me, I completely respect that, but if you expect anything  different from the President of the United States, I suggest you vote for somebody else.  Thanks very much. Hope you enjoyed the chicken."
12111,bartlet,Please. Help me to the door.
12113,bartlet,Charlie brought me some clothes. Please let me see him.
12118,bartlet,"I understand the point that Cal was making. I was sitting next to him when he made it,  my ears are connected to my brain just like every body else. And I'm saying what's next?"
12119,bartlet,You're not afraid he's gonna make me look like I can't remember his name?
12120,bartlet,I am. I think it's going to make me look like I can't remember his name. I think it's  going to make me look addled. I think it's going to make me look dotty. And even if it  didn't make me look like those things it would remain a stupid idea. What's next? Nothing?  Excellent. 
12124,toby,He's talking about the Governor's answer tonight.
12125,toby,I'm just guessing. I'm pretty drunk.
12132,bartlet,Did you just fire Cal Mathis?
12136,bartlet,Is there anyone you kept?
12138,bartlet,"Oh, you kept Toby Ziegler, and you fired everyone else."
12140,bartlet,"Toby Ziegler is the only person working for us I don't know, and he's the one you kept!"
12142,bartlet,Those were the only people I know.
12144,bartlet,So you made that decision on your own.
12146,bartlet,You know I got elected to Congress by this state. This state sent me to Congress three  times and elected me Governor all without your help.
12151,bartlet,You got rid of all the people I know!
12153,bartlet,Why are you doing this? You're a player. You're bigger in the party than I am. Hoynes  would make you national chairman. Leo! Tell me this isn't one of the twelve steps.
12157,bartlet,And you think I'm that man.
12159,bartlet,Does it matter that I'm not as sure?
12164,c.j.,"We're confirming now that a suspect is in custody, and is being questioned by federal  law enforcement. At this time, we cannot, we are not releasing any information whatsoever  about the suspect."
12165,c.j.,"Yes, Steve, I can tell you those things, because when I said that we weren't releasing  any information whatsoever, I meant except than his name, his address, his ethnicity,  and what we think his motives are."
12166,c.j.,"I am releasing the name of Stephanie Abbott, A-B-B-O-T-T, from Silver Spring, Maryland,  who was in the crowd, and sustained an injury to the left femur, which is the thighbone. "
12167,c.j.,"The President remains in stable condition in the recovery room, and is expected to return  home Wednesday. Josh Lyman is in his sixth hour of surgery..."
12175,c.j., You got them on the phone?
12177,c.j.,"Sam, I need you to come back to the White House and speak to Nancy McNally about a letter  the President was supposed to sign. She'll know what you're talking about."
12181,c.j.,They're still asking about the tent.
12183,c.j.,"I'd be more comfortable with the ""no comment"" coming from the Secret Service, though... "
12185,toby,They want to know why the President exited the building in the open air.
12204,josh," Look, Operator, I'm looking for the number of a law firm in Manhattan.  Here's the thing, I can't quite remember the name of the firm... no, wait, wait, wait!  I just came back from New Hampshire, where I saw this guy and now I have to... look it's  a very famous firm that handles Shearson, you must know... okay, you know what, I'm just  going to - okay, bye. "
12224,c.j.,"Oh, it's fine. I wanted to see if you talked to Nancy McNally."
12226,c.j.,"Sam, you didn't happen to notice, when the shooting started, you didn't happen to notice  who pulled me to the ground, did you?"
12228,c.j.,"They pulled me down behind the police car, and my necklace came off... "
12230,c.j.,You talked to Nancy McNally?
12235,c.j.,"No, that's not a good --"
12236,c.j.,"No, I'm not doing any interviews just yet, I'm not doing it."
12237,c.j.,Which one of our people?
12239,c.j.,Somebody around here thought I should do the morning shows.
12241,c.j.,"Danny, it's a little complicated. There's something called the National Security Act of  1947. There's the 25th. Nancy McNally, the White House Counsel, Bill Hutchinson, they're  all working on it right now."
12242,c.j.,And we are working on that information.  We're working on it.
12243,c.j.,"Hello?  Isobel, it's 6:30 in the  morning! Yeah. "
12244,c.j.,"Good morning, Isobel. Hi, Roger. "
12246,c.j.,"It was 6:30 in the morning, Roger, I wasn't quite ready for work, but I am now. How can  I help you? "
12247,c.j.,I wasn't. Am I up for something? 
12248,c.j.,"Roger, I think we put together a very aggressive campaign."
12249,c.j.,That's two nominations more than a lot of people got.
12250,c.j.,The Hundred Most Powerful People in Hollywood.
12251,c.j.,"Yes, I am, and I can tell you that you're on it, and uh, congratulations, and it must,  you know, feel good being that powerful."
12253,c.j.,"The movies were bad, Roger, all of them. Even the little kid was bad, but he was a little  kid, he had a couple of scenes, big eyeglasses, lisp, he's going to the Golden Globes.  You know why the New Coke marketing campaign failed? Because nobody liked New Coke.  The movies were bad. If the movies were unknown, I could help you, but they weren't.  They were just bad!"
12254,c.j.,"Sorry I talked to him like that, but did he really think he had ""The Maltese Falcon""  out there?"
12255,c.j.,"I'll apologize to him, Isobel. I'll find someone to make him Man of the Year. I'll ask  around in Vegas."
12256,c.j.,He's going to pull his business unless you fire me?
12258,c.j.,"So take me off Film and Television, I don't know anything about it, anyway! We have  plenty of accounts..."
12260,c.j.,Out here in the hallway!?
12261,c.j., I need someone to call me a cab!
12262,c.j.,"I couldn't get my contacts in this morning, and I broke my glasses getting out of the  car. I can't drive myself home. I need someone to call me a cab."
12263,c.j.,"It was a bad movie, Isobel."
12270,c.j.,What the hell are you --
12271,toby,"C.J., you fell into the pool, there."
12273,toby,"Yeah, well, maybe, kind of, uh, try to feel your way to dry land?"
12277,c.j.,"I'm climbing out of the pool, my clothes will be clingy, avert your eyes!"
12278,toby," C.J., I really didn't come here --"
12282,toby,I tried calling you at your office. They said you were fired. Were you stealing things?
12283,c.j.,Roger Becker dropped from third most powerful person in Hollywood to ninth most powerful  person in Hollywood.
12284,toby,"Does he still make the playoffs, or is the cutoff line..."
12285,c.j.,They take it seriously.
12286,toby,"C.J., Jed Bartlet is very impressed with you. "
12287,toby,He likes the work that you did with that girl's group with the stupid name.
12290,c.j.,That girl's group with the stupid name?
12292,c.j.,"Emily's List -- ""early money is like yeast""."
12294,c.j.,"""It helps raise the dough""."
12296,c.j.,"They raise money for women candidates. “Early money is like yeast, it helps raise the  dough.” For the candidates."
12298,c.j.,Bartlet's impressed with me?
12299,toby,Very impressed. And one of the big keys to his game plan is bringing you on as Press  Secretary.
12300,c.j.,"He's never heard of me, has he? "
12303,toby,I'm here on instructions from Leo McGarry.
12305,toby,Yes. Come join the campaign. 
12307,toby,How much were you making before? 
12312,c.j.,Toby. Does he know I've only ever worked statewide? Does he know I've never worked on a  national campaign before?
12313,toby,Yes. It's Graduation Day.
12314,c.j.,You really think I can do this? 
12316,c.j.,Is Jed Bartlet a good man?
12320,c.j.,"Then, let's go into the house so I can change my clothes and we can talk about it. "
12325,bartlet,"We don't know what the injury count is, yet."
12327,bartlet,"Yeah. Charlie, the guy the Secret Service has in custody is named Carl Leroy. He gives  a statement in which he says that he and the two shooters were members of an organization  called West Virginia White Pride."
12330,bartlet," We don't know what the injury count is, yet."
12341,c.j.,"Leo, who thought it was a good idea for me to do the morning shows?"
12345,c.j.,I think it's a bad idea.
12347,c.j.,"I just... First of all, I think it's inappropriate while Josh, you know, until --"
12350,c.j.,"Nothing. I'd rather not do it, but obviously."
12352,c.j.," Okay. Listen, the letter."
12354,c.j.,"The three and a half hours? I don't know how much longer I can dance around Danny, and  it's going to be Danny times a hundred by lunchtime."
12360,toby,She says she's been getting a couple of questions about why the President exited in  the open air. You remember the Secret Service usually constructs a tent or a canopy.  I'm going to talk to Ron Butterfield.
12362,toby,"I know. But maybe I can talk him out of it. I should try, anyway."
12364,toby,"Yeah, I should, though."
12365,c.j.,"Okay, who can tell me what we did wrong there?"
12366,bartlet,I blew it. What's next?
12367,c.j.,"We didn't have the candidate. That's right. Anyone who answered ""we didn't have the  candidate"" -"
12369,josh,Toby wants to say something. 
12372,bartlet, And which one are you?
12375,toby,Let's get out of New Hampshire. 
12379,bartlet,The New Hampshire primary isn't held in New Hampshire anymore?
12380,toby,You can't win the New Hampshire primary.
12381,bartlet,I am going to win the New Hampshire primary.
12382,toby,Which is why you can't win it. 
12383,josh,You're incredibly popular in this state.
12385,toby,"There's no way that you can exceed expectations, all you can hope for is an  ""as expected"", and there's always the possibility that you could embarrass yourself."
12386,bartlet,"I appreciate that, thanks. "
12387,josh,Toby meant in the polls.
12389,toby,"So, Hoynes will be in a fight with Wiley for a strong second place finish in  New Hampshire, meantime we're going to be in South Carolina, and we're going  to be the only ones there."
12390,bartlet,We're not going to beat Hoynes in South Carolina.
12391,toby,We don't have to beat Hoynes in South Carolina.
12392,c.j.,We just have to beat Wiley.
12393,bartlet, Wiley's going to drop out after South Carolina?
12395,bartlet,Are we going to get his endorsement?
12402,toby,"So, we finish second in South Carolina, we pick up some steam, some endorsements,  mostly some money, going into South Dakota, Vermont, Maine --"
12404,c.j.,And half the actual primaries - 
12406,josh,Hoynes will take the South. We’ll take the North and the Pacific Northwest.
12407,toby,This race will be decided a week later in Illinois.
12408,c.j.,Illinois will be High Noon.
12411,bartlet,"Well, that's it, then. And we saved people the trouble of voting. What's next?"
12412,josh,Our point is that it's --
12413,bartlet,"I understand the point. We're going to South Carolina to set up Illinois. When I ask,  ""What's next?"", it means that I'm ready to move on to other things. So, what's next?"
12416,josh,"Well, I feel bathed in the warm embrace of the candidate."
12418,josh,How many people get that far? 
12430,josh,Did I have an old assistant? 
12440,josh,I'm going to talk to Margaret. 
12448,josh,When did your boyfriend break up with you?
12450,josh,"Well, you're too old for your parents to have kicked you out of the house."
12452,josh,Where did you graduate?
12454,josh,Where did you graduate?
12460,josh,You majored in Political Science and Government?
12466,josh,You had five majors and two minors in four years?
12470,josh,Your boyfriend was older than you?
12472,josh,"Donna, you were just at my desk, reading my calendar, answering my phone, and hoping  that I wouldn't notice that I never hired you. Your boyfriend was older?"
12476,josh,And the idea was that you'd drop out and pay the bills till he was done with his  residency.
12478,josh,And why did Dr. Freeloader break up with you.
12480,josh,"Donna, this is a campaign for the Presidency, and there's nothing I take more seriously  than that. This can't be a place where people come to find their confidence and start  over. "
12486,josh,"Donna, we're picking up today and going to South Carolina. If you want to stay in the  Manchester office - "
12488,josh,"I can't carry you, Donna! I got a lot of guys out there not making the trip."
12499,c.j.,"Take a walk with me, would you? "
12500,c.j.,They're taking him off bypass now. 
12502,c.j.,You did well on the morning shows. 
12504,c.j.,I told Leo the reason I didn't want to do it was that it didn't feel right with Josh  still in surgery.
12506,c.j.,You know what the real reason was? 
12512,c.j.," The real reason I couldn't go on the morning shows and give  a first-hand account of what happened is that I couldn't remember what happened.  I remember walking out of the building, I remember somebody knocked me down, I know my  necklace came off, and I know a police car window exploded over my head. All night long,  I've been doing my press briefings using notes from other people's accounts. But it's  morning now, and after listening to you on the morning shows, I know what happened."
12513,c.j.,Sam. I think you have my necklace. 
12519,c.j.,"Sam, I don't feel beholden to you. "
12521,c.j.,Can I have my necklace back? 
12530,toby,"Pretty soon, yeah. Listen, can I talk to you for a minute?"
12533,toby,C.J.'s starting to get some questions about why the President's exit wasn't covered in  Rosslyn.
12534,toby,"Yeah. Ron, a few weeks after the President was sworn in, you got a memo about his  protection."
12535,toby,"It said he wanted to enter and exit in the open air, and he didn't like the feeling of  traveling around in an armored tank."
12536,toby,"Specifically, it said he wouldn't use the tent or the canopy anymore."
12537,toby,"I wrote that memo, and the President signed it at my urging."
12538,toby,"Ron, I don't think it's right that the Secret Service get blamed for what happened last  night, I want the Treasury Department to hand over my memo to the Press. "
12539,toby,There are going to be a lot of questions.
12541,toby,It's not right. You're the guys - look at your hand.
12543,toby,Let me go over there and tell them it was my fault.
12547,c.j.,"The Secret Service Agents carry a weapon called a .357 sig-hauer. The agents on the roof  shot the two men with .726 caliber rifles that are referred to as JAR, which believe it  or not, stands for ""Just Another Rifle"". They are made specifically and exclusively for  the Secret Service."
12549,c.j.,"This is our 5th press briefing since midnight. Obviously, there's one story that going  dominating news around the world for the next few days, and it would be easy to think  that President Bartlet, Joshua Lyman, and Stephanie Abbott were the only victims of a gun  crime last night. They weren't. Mark Davis and Sheila Evans of Philadelphia were killed  by a gun last night. He was a Biology Teacher and she was a Nursing student. Tina Bishop  and Linda Larkin were killed with a gun last night. They were 12. There were 36 homicides  last night. 480 sexual assaults, 3,411 robberies, 3,685 aggravated assaults, all at  gunpoint. And if anyone thinks those crimes could have been prevented if the victims  themselves had been carrying guns, I'd only remind you that the President of the United  States himself was shot last night while surrounded by the best trained armed guards in  the history of the world. Back to the briefing."
12559,josh,I'm talking to nobody. There's no one at my house.
12561,josh,Nothing. My dad had his chemo today. These exit polls are going to cheer him up.
12570,josh,That's Sam's draft of your victory remarks.
12571,bartlet,"""I congratulate my opponent on a well-fought campaign in Illinois""?"
12573,bartlet,"Yes, I want to congratulate him, but I'd like to call him by his name! Are we back to  this old crap again?"
12575,bartlet,"Leo, I want to go over this whole thing with you."
12578,josh,"Your husband's a real son of a bitch, Mrs. Bartlet."
12580,josh,"Well, I think that if he looked around, he'd see that nobody's handling him."
12582,josh,"Well, is he going to be ready? "
12588,josh,"Leo, we've got to replace this music, we've got to replace it with some Doobie Brothers!"
12590,josh,"And Donna, you've got to get happy, Donna, you just won the Illinois Primary, come dance  with me!"
12594,bartlet,"Your father died, Josh. I can't believe it."
12595,josh,"Yeah, uh, Governor, you -- you shouldn't be here."
12597,josh,"He, uh, went for his chemotherapy and he unexpectedly developed a pulmonary embolism,  it's a --"
12599,josh,Yeah. It went to his heart and there was cardiac arrest.
12601,josh,"Governor, you should really get back to the ballroom, so that you can get on a plane and  get to California. "
12604,bartlet,Did he like that you were in politics?
12605,josh,I think he would have liked grandchildren more.
12607,josh,He liked that I was working for you. He liked that we were starting to do well.  He would've liked tonight. At least his friends and neighbors will be spared all the...  you know...  
12608,bartlet,He'd have been doing some bragging?
12609,josh,"Yeah, and your name wouldn't have come up, by the way. ""My son won the Illinois primary  tonight"". Three more hours, and he would have been able to say that. He'd have been proud."
12610,bartlet,"He was already. Trust me, Josh, I'm a father. He was already."
12611,josh,"I appreciate that, Governor. You should really get back to the hotel."
12613,josh,"Sir, not that I don't appreciate you coming down here, but there's a ballroom full of  people waiting for a victory speech."
12615,josh,"Yeah, they will, but the people watching television won't."
12616,bartlet,"I've been a real jackass to you, Josh."
12618,bartlet,"To everybody. Toby Ziegler, C.J. Cregg, Sam Seaborn."
12620,bartlet,"Don't think I don't know what you gave up to work on this campaign, and don't think that  I don't know your value. And I'll never make you think I don't again. You got to be a  little impressed that I got all those names right just now. "
12621,josh,They're calling my flight. 
12622,bartlet,You want me to go with you? 
12624,bartlet,Maybe you want some company on the plane. 
12625,bartlet,I could get a ticket and come with you.
12626,josh,Governor! California. You have to go the ballroom and give a Victory speech in primetime  and go to California.
12628,josh," You guess I'm right? Listen to me, Governor, if you don't lose this election,  it isn't going to be because you didn't try hard enough. But it was nice of you to ask.  Thank you, I appreciate."
12629,bartlet,They're calling your flight. 
12636,bartlet,"I couldn't hear you, Josh."
12638,bartlet,"He said, ""What's next?"""
12639,c.j.,The Theory of Everything?
12641,c.j.,"That was a joke there, pal-o-mine."
12642,c.j.,"Carol, I'm missing the OMB stats."
12643,c.j.,I'm not gonna lead with it.
12647,josh,"I mean, you got what you're suppose to say."
12650,c.j.,"Joshua, I really have to get to the briefing room."
12652,c.j.,Psychics at Cal Tech and the FERMI National Accelerator Lab are close to announcing what...
12653,josh,Physicists! Theoretical physicists at Cal Tech...
12655,c.j.,I should jot that down.
12657,c.j.,I tell you if it was psychics I'd lead with it. 
12658,c.j.,Talk to you later mi amor. 
12659,c.j.,Thank you. You can set 'em down and let JOSH rant a little before you hang up the phone.
12661,toby,The Bureau of Labor Statistics is going to report that the CPI jump 0.7%...
12663,toby,...is the biggest one month increase since the Bureau began tracking prices in '52.
12664,c.j.,"All right, let me say this, the market basket used to calculate the CPI is antiquated. "
12666,c.j.,And doesn't include some regular house hold items...
12669,toby,The prices are always dropping...
12671,toby,"...and doesn't reflect significant technical improvements like airbags in automobiles, which  increase the price of the car very slightly, but provide a much greater value to the consumer.  You got all that? "
12675,c.j.,"Well, the network's gonna want to break in with special coverage for that."
12677,c.j.,"Seriously, they're going to need time to put together a logo and theme music."
12679,c.j.,Reported the CPI jumped by 0.7%.
12681,c.j.,"Oh, Holy Interruptus, Batman!"
12685,c.j.,He's really dead this time?
12687,c.j.,Cause last time you told me he was dead and he wasn't.
12689,c.j.,Somebody poked him a little to see...
12691,c.j.,"Well, okay, then I shouldn't have made a joke."
12697,c.j.,I'm not going to learn their names.
12699,c.j.,"Eileen, Robert, Priscilla, Patty, and eight grandchildren. And I'm assuming it was  complications due to... "
12701,c.j.,You know anything about Theoretical Physics?
12703,c.j.,You know anything about it?
12706,c.j.,"Good morning everybody. I have to start with a sad announcement. Congressman Grant Samuels  finally succumbed to pneumonia last night. His wife, Eileen, his son, Robert, his daughters,  Priscilla and Patty, and his eight grandchildren are all in the President's thoughts today.  I also want to talk this morning about the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Federal Housing  Administration. "
12707,c.j.,"And as a special treat for our friend, Josh Lyman, who's recovering very nicely at G.W.  The President's science advisors is telling us that psychics at Cal Tech and the Fermi  National Accelerator Lab....."
12710,c.j.,(sarcastically) Do you think?
12712,c.j.,"A week ago the job approval's at 51. We get shot at and it's at 81. Yeah, I think the numbers  are soft."
12714,bartlet,"Good morning, everybody. Anybody know what the word 'acalculia' means?"
12716,bartlet,"Yeah, but I'll get over it. "
12723,c.j.,"Those aren't internals. It's CNN, USA Today."
12727,bartlet,Well 19% of the country has clearly made up their minds about me; 20% just feel sorry for me.  This is what you want if you're the leader of the free world. Give us an over view. 
12729,c.j.,They're not going to elect a democrat in the Florida 9th.
12731,c.j.,"Since you brought up Cumberland and Monroe, can I say a word about the shooting?  (beat) It's been a week and the honeymoon's about to be over."
12733,c.j.,We want to be sure it doesn't look like we're taking advantage of the situation.
12736,toby,The entire country was the victim of domestic terrorism. Why not use the soft numbers before  they disappear and go after the guns and go after the hate groups?
12739,c.j.,"Well, you work for the White House, Toby. I think we were counting on your support, either way."
12741,bartlet,"C.J., if you get questions about the midterms, say ""we haven't thought that far ahead due to  recent events."""
12744,bartlet,"I'll let you know. Thank you very much, everyone."
12745,bartlet,(reads the note) It's fine. Tell them around 3 o'clock.
12750,bartlet,Did you know Elliot Roush is running to for the school board in Manchester?
12756,bartlet,I beat him in my first Congressional campaign.
12758,bartlet,I want some polling numbers on that race.
12760,bartlet,"Yeah, 'cause looking at two numbers on a piece of paper really takes the life out of me."
12762,bartlet,Get me the numbers. Let me tell you something...
12764,bartlet,...I'm ready to go out there.
12766,bartlet,I don't need to wait another week.
12791,toby,"I'm saying, I could've used your support in there."
12792,c.j.,You get my support the same way I get yours. When I agree with what you're saying or when I  don't care about what you're saying. This time I disagree.
12793,toby,You don't think we should use the moment to get aggressive about guns and hate groups?
12794,c.j.,I think we were victims of a violent crime and it's unseemly to use this moment at all.
12795,toby,"We didn't get the country drunk, C.J. We're not taking advantage of anybody, and even if we  were, who cares?"
12796,c.j.,Every Republican spending the next 12 weeks trying to keep control of the House.
12797,c.j.,"Toby! If you and the FBI want to go after hate groups, I'm not the one you have to convince.  Go bag the President. "
12799,c.j.,I've gotten a lot of calls about pieces people want to do on how staffers are handling the  shooting and the aftermath.
12801,c.j.,Yeah. I don't think it's a good idea. Do you?
12803,c.j.,That's what I'm saying.
12805,toby,"(to himself) I got it. I got it. I got it. (beat) I got it. Bonnie, Ginger, I got it."
12810,toby," Oh, I thought you were in there."
12814,toby,How to avoid the appearance that we're randomly and generically going after extremist groups  in violation of their civil liberties.
12816,toby,"Yes, or with this. The shooting was the action of not one, but at least three card carrying  members of West Virginia White Pride."
12820,toby,"What the hell? No, Sam, it was an expression."
12822,toby,"The key phrase is ""at least"", at least three members. There might be more. We don't know."
12824,toby,"Yes, to investigate or curtail the activities of all extremist organizations...."
12826,toby,How do we know that whatever young Nazis of Delaware weren't co-conspirators?
12828,toby,"Possibly, because, I had no help from anyone else who works in this building."
12846,toby,Fartoost. Don't bring the Yiddish unless you know what you're doing.
12852,toby,I need to talk to him about...
12854,toby,And I'd like to go to his apartment and talk to him.
12870,bartlet,The guy is polling at 46%.
12871,c.j.,I didn't think they had polling data on people running for seats on the Board of Education.
12872,bartlet,They didn't. I had to have our guys do it.
12873,c.j.,"Sir, do you think you're becoming obsessed with this race?"
12874,bartlet,He's polling at 46%. He's not a joke. He's polling inside the margin.
12875,c.j.,"In a race for the Board of Education, in a school district that has 43 kids."
12876,bartlet,"It has 1100 kids, and you don't take these people seriously 'cause they don't get anywhere  nationally, but they don't have to. All they have to do is, bit by little bit, get themselves  on the Boards of Education and city councils. 'Cause that's where all the governing that  really matters to anybody really happens."
12877,c.j.,"We do a little governing here, Mr. President."
12878,bartlet,I'm on hold with a guy whose name I've got on an index card. How much governing do you think  is going on around here today? And can you believe I'm on hold?
12879,c.j.,"You're not, sir. You finished the call."
12885,bartlet,Elliot Roush is now polling at 46%.
12889,bartlet, I have 3 daughters who grew up in that school district.
12891,bartlet,"And he has come back. Like crab grass pulled from the lawn. Not by the root, but by the  other thing."
12895,bartlet,Can't tell you how much I'm going to miss you. (to Zoey) You wanted to talk to me?
12896,bartlet,"(big sigh) This is real and a man, who makes the Spanish Inquisition look like a Barbara  Walters Special, is now polling at 46% in your school district, for which I have personally  baked things to raise money. (to C.J.) You can go, too."
12899,c.j.,"(more seriously) Thank you, Mr. President."
12901,c.j.,The calls are going well.
12903,c.j.,"Listen, Leo, we're still asked to participate in aftermath stories."
12905,c.j.,Yeah and I was wondering....
12907,c.j.,"No, I know that. But I was wondering..."
12909,c.j.,This isn't going to be good.
12913,c.j.,"(into phone) Hey, it's C.J. Cregg."
12914,toby,Step 3: Public disclosure of membership and contributor rolls for all organizations on the  Attorney General's list of hate groups. This allows for the American public to know who their  people are and where their funding is coming from.
12918,toby,I knew you were going to say that.
12920,toby,"That was an ultra-activist Warren Court that struck down those laws and I think they'd see it  differently, today."
12922,toby,"And I was shot at and so I am acting, right now!"
12925,c.j.,Any problems with the first Amendment?
12929,c.j.,There's a problem with your friend.
12931,c.j.,"Tom Jordan, the guy you got running."
12933,c.j.,His prosecutorial record.
12935,c.j.,Not during jury selection. 
12937,c.j.,Your friend likes white jurists for his black defendants.
12939,c.j.,"Not anymore. Now he's a politician and this needs a save. So, get into it, would you?"
12941,bartlet,Do we know how Tokyo opened?
12944,bartlet,Frank Gates and McNamara?
12945,bartlet,Those are campaign calls.
12946,bartlet,"Because I choose not to, Charlie. Because, however an empty gesture it may seem, I would  like to take some executive notice of the notion that it's probably not a good idea for the  most powerful and influential person in the world to be calling up the people whose laws  he signs and asking them for money! (beat) I'm going to do it, but not behind this desk  and not in this room. What else?"
12947,bartlet,Yeah. (takes the phone messages) I'll make these calls from the Residence. Tell C.J. I want  to see her in an hour. 
12967,josh,We got a chance at the House. We've only got 3 weeks left. Leo’s got to put the President  and the money where the President and money can win. 
12971,josh,Which will matter less if we get back the house.
12973,josh,"Not only that, we stand by him, this is a national thing. It could drag down black turn out  in districts where we're competitive."
12984,toby,(without looking up) Yeah. 
12985,c.j.,Any chance I can see an advanced copy of the President's remark for the Asia Pacific?
12988,toby,I have a draft here. I'm going to rewrite it.
12989,c.j.,I thought I was going to have it by the end of the day.
12990,toby,The day's not over yet.
12991,c.j.,"You know, Toby. These pieces everyone wants to do on the psychological aftermath of the  shooting for the White House staff, they had me thinking. Do you think there might be a  psychological aftermath and we're not paying attention to it?"
12992,toby,"C.J., I really don't have time to have this conversation."
12993,c.j.,"I'm saying, I think you should have this conversation with somebody."
12994,toby,You think my problem is psychological?
12996,c.j.,...So you can behave like the Director of the FBI.
12997,toby,"Well, I'm waiting for the Director of FBI to behave that way."
12999,toby,I'm waiting for the Justice department to behave that way. I'm waiting for Congress to  behave that way. 
13000,toby,I'm waiting for the White House to behave that way!
13001,c.j.,You want to lock up everybody with a white sheet?
13002,toby,"Yes, I do. Yes, I do. Who has a problem with that? Bring 'em to me, right now. YES I DO!"
13005,c.j.,"I'll be here for a while, so... whenever you can get me Asia Pacific."
13008,c.j.," Good evening, Mr. President. "
13010,c.j.,Charlie said you wanted to see me.
13011,bartlet,Yeah. Why has there been no press mentioned that the fact that Elliot Roush was an opponent  of mine in New Hampshire?
13012,c.j.,Elliot Roush is the man....?
13013,bartlet,He's running for a seat on the school board up in New Hampshire.
13014,c.j.,"Yes, sir. I'm sure it's gotten some local coverage. I can have the news office run...."
13015,bartlet,Why isn't it more than local?
13016,c.j.,It's a school board seat.
13017,bartlet,It's a human interest story.
13018,c.j.,Not a very interesting one.
13019,bartlet,"I'm saying, if anyone in the Press Room wanted to do this story that I would comment on the  record."
13020,c.j.,"Sir, the President can't publicly take sides in a local school board election."
13022,c.j.,"Because it's not done, and it's not fair. It's personal and it's irresponsible. It will  galvanize the Republicans and the Democrats in Congress will think you've abandoned them,  that you don't care about winning back the House. "
13023,bartlet,I don't care about winning back the House.
13025,bartlet,I don't care about winning back the House!
13026,c.j.,"Well, I don't believe that's true so let's just keep that between you and me."
13027,bartlet,"C.J., I've known men of faith in my life. Towering men. Men of wisdom and compassion.  Men of all faiths, of healing and peace. Pro choices, pro-life, Republican, Democrat,  men and women of God. Elliot Roush... (long beat) ...is polling at 53%. He's polling  at 53%. He's the front runner."
13028,c.j.,"Then that's the way it is. In a democracy, oftentimes, the other people win."
13029,bartlet,"Yeah. It was just a thought, but I mean, obviously, you're right."
13032,c.j.,"Thank you, Mr. President."
13044,c.j.,(waking up a bit) Stern.
13045,c.j.,Isn't Don Imus in this 70's?
13046,c.j.," How are you ""Dave in the Morning"" before he was ""Imus in the Morning?"""
13047,c.j.,"Okay. Fellas, I'm sorry, but it's Election Day and I need to check in with the exit polls..."
13048,c.j.,...and what not. Good meeting you both.
13053,toby,"Good evening, Mr. President."
13054,bartlet,"Toby, I'm drinking the most fantastic thing I've ever tasted in my life: chocolate syrup,  cold milk, and seltzer. I know it sounds terrible, but trust me, I don't know where this  has been all my life."
13055,toby,"It's called an egg cream, Mr. President. We invented it in Brooklyn."
13059,toby,"There are some good things in this world not from New England, sir."
13060,bartlet,"Toby, don't ever let me hear you say that again."
13063,toby,"Mr. President, I was thinking... I was thinking it might..."
13064,bartlet,You want to take a leave of absence.
13065,toby,"I was thinking I might need some time off, yes sir."
13066,bartlet,"That's no problem, Toby."
13071,bartlet,"It's time to get up off the mat, Toby."
13072,toby,"Sir, what's to wrong with having the Attorney General designate potentially..."
13074,toby,"...dangerous organizations that promote violent acts? I... I... understand it's problematic.  Ah... uh... there'd be no judicial review, or legislative oversight, or even for that matter  legal finding of fact, but... (big sigh) Okay... fine... fine... (choked up with emotion)  Why does it feel like this? I've seen shootings before."
13075,bartlet," It wasn't a shooting, Toby. It was a lynching. They tried to lynch  Charlie right in front of our eyes, can you believe that?"
13077,bartlet,"Keyhole satellite photographs. It's the headquarters for West Virginia White Pride  headquarters. It's a diner outside Blacksberg. Every night for the past 12 weeks,  I've picked up the phone and called the Attorney General, fully prepared to say two  wordstake 'em. And then I hang up the phone because I know it'll be better tomorrow  and better the day after that. We saw a lynching, Toby. That's why it feels like this."
13078,toby,I'm not sure I'm going to come out of the other side of this. 
13079,bartlet,"I'm not sure I can either. But until we are sure, I think we should keep coming into work  every day. "
13080,toby,How's it going with your school board guy?
13082,toby,"When you ran against him, how'd you beat him?"
13083,bartlet,"I don't remember. I've been thinking about it for weeks, but I honestly don't remember."
13087,bartlet,"Let me look at them while we walk. Toby, go with us, to this radio thing."
13089,bartlet,"There'll be crab puffs. New England crab puffs, by the way, made in New England."
13092,bartlet,There's Alaskan crab in this White House?
13093,toby,He wouldn't have known the difference.
13099,c.j.,"How else would you spell ""Gary""?"
13102,c.j.,"Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen. Ladies and gentlemen. The President of the United States."
13103,bartlet,"Thank you. Thank you, very much. Thanks a lot. I wish I could spend more than a few minutes  with you but the polls don't close in the east for another hour and there are plenty of  election results left to falsify. "
13104,bartlet,"You know with so many people participating in the political and social debate through call  in shows, it's a good idea to be reminded..."
13105,bartlet,...it's a good idea to be reminded of the awesome impact... the awesome impact...
13106,bartlet,"I'm sorry, um... you're Dr. Jenna Jacobs, right? "
13107,bartlet,It's good to have you here.
13108,bartlet,The awesome impact of the airwaves and how that translates into the furthering of our national  discussions but obviously also how it can... how it can...
13109,bartlet,"Forgive me, Dr. Jacobs. Are you an M.D.?"
13114,bartlet,"I'm asking, 'cause on your show, people call in for advice and you go by the name of  Dr. Jacobs on your show. And I didn't know if maybe your listeners were confused by that,  and assumed you had advanced training in Psychology, Theology, or health care."
13115,bartlet,Good. I like your show. I like how you call homosexuality an abomination.
13116,bartlet,"Yes, it does. Leviticus."
13117,bartlet,"Chapter and verse. I wanted to ask you a couple of questions while I had you here.  I'm interested in selling my youngest daughter into slavery as sanctioned in Exodus 21:7.  (small chuckles from the guests) She's a Georgetown sophomore, speaks fluent Italian, and  always clears the table when it was her turn. What would a good price for her be? While  thinking about that, can I ask another? My Chief of Staff, LeoO McGarry, insists on working  on the Sabbath, Exodus 35:2, clearly says he should be put to death. Am I morally obligated  to kill him myself or is it okay to call the police? Here's one that's really important,  'cause we've got a lot of sports fans in this town. Touching the skin of a dead pig makes  us unclean, Leviticus 11:7. If they promise to wear gloves, can the Washington Redskins  still play football? Can Notre Dame? Can West Point? Does the whole town really have to be  together to stone my brother, John, for planting different crops side by side? Can I burn  my mother in a small family gathering for wearing garments made from two different threads? "
13118,bartlet,"Think about those questions, would you? One last thing, while you may be mistaking this  for your monthly meeting of the Ignorant Tightass Club, in this building, when the President  stands, nobody sits."
13131,josh,"Everybody should have to stay inside for three months so that they truly appreciate the  outdoors. I appreciate the outdoors, now. I'm an outdoorsman."
13135,josh,"(to C.J.) Aha! You'd thought I'd forget about it, didn't you? Banner headline, 5 days ago.  Model for the Unified Theory solved. Banner headline in the New York Times. You said it wasn't  going to be news. "
13136,c.j.,Hey! You're wearing my pajamas.
13138,c.j.,"Take your coat off, let's see."
13140,josh,"Yes, they are. All this time I've been working with you, did you also think I was playing  power forward for the Cleveland Cavaliers?"
13141,c.j.,I think they look good on you. (grabs Toby’s arms)
13142,toby,I think you're all freaks.
13148,c.j.,Seven republicans and five democrats?
13150,josh,The house stayed the same?
13151,josh,"After four months and 400 million dollars, everything stayed the same."
13153,josh,"Tell me democracy doesn't have a sense of humor. We sit here, we drink this beer out here  on the stoop, in violation about 47 city ordinances. I don't know, Toby, it's election night.  What do you say about a government that goes out of its way to protect even citizens that try  to destroy it?"
13183,josh, Toby. Come quick! Sam's getting his ass kicked by a girl! 
13184,toby,"Ginger, get the popcorn! "
13185,c.j.,...in a half hour with President Bartlet and President Nimbala of the Republic of  Equatorial Kuhndu who's representing the African nations. 
13186,c.j.,"The goal of the summit is to get a step closer to solving twenty-six million African AIDS  victims.  We're counting on the drug companies, we're  counting on the African nations, we're counting on the global health community and  they're counting on the White House to help broker a solution. "
13187,c.j.,"Well, it sounds like you already have, so if we need a button man, we'll call you.  Thank you, everybody, half hour in the Mural Room. "
13188,c.j., Tell them they need to be in three groups. 
13189,toby,You know what you might have mentioned? 
13190,c.j.,"It was a 14 minute briefing, I'm really gonna get reviews? "
13191,toby,"You might have mentioned that the same drug that costs ten dollars and eighty cents in  Norway, where nobody needs it, costs ninety dollars in Burundi, where everybody needs it. "
13192,c.j.,"There is nothing keeping these people here but good will, Toby! They can charge what they  want for their products. "
13193,toby,It sounds to me like we intend to be soft on the drug companies. 
13194,c.j.,"Toby, I don't think anybody expects this White House to be anything but tough on American  companies showing a profit. "
13199,c.j.," Sam! I've really gotta admire the way you came into work this  morning, head held high. "
13201,c.j.,No problem.  There's a whole bunch of women over there. Why don't you  ask them whether Geneva's in Switzerland or Oregon? 
13212,toby," That drug they've gotta buy from us for four dollars a unit, they can get  generic from Pakistan for forty cents. "
13213,c.j.," That's not the only bargain in Pakistan, Toby. My girlfriends and I go  for the spring fashions. "
13215,c.j.," He just made a little dig about my clothes, and  that's what's gonna be with me the rest of the day. "
13218,c.j.,That's what I'm here for.
13219,c.j.,"I'm not gonna wave you off the story, but I can't tell you anything about it. "
13220,c.j.,"Grand jury investigations are secret, Bill. I can't tell you any more about it. "
13223,c.j.,Nothing. Just... nothing. 
13225,bartlet,Would you like me to show you the list of dead millionaires? 
13227,bartlet,"Leo, AIDS is caused by HIV. You just named a group of people that have a higher mortality  rate across the board. Morning, Charlie. "
13231,bartlet,They have a Health Minister who doesn't think AIDS is connected to HIV! 
13234,bartlet,He got diced and sliced by a woman named Ainsley Hayes. 
13236,bartlet,"I know, I had Charlie pull 'em for me. Where's she been? "
13244,bartlet,"No, not as a joke, I mean we should hire her as a reality. We should hire her. "
13246,bartlet,So are half the people in this country. 
13248,bartlet,"She's smart, she's not just carping. She feels a sense of something. "
13250,bartlet,Yeah.  Of duty. Of civic duty. 
13254,bartlet,I can sense civic duty a mile away. 
13258,bartlet,"Good morning, Mr. President. "
13259,bartlet, You can tell your caption editors that Bartlet's the third guy from the  right. 
13260,c.j.,"Thank you, sir.  Presidents Bartlet and Nimbala will take just a few  questions. "
13262,bartlet," Yes, Katie, I'm trying to shore up the sub-Saharan vote. "
13263,bartlet,It's an international health crisis; there's nothing I'm not considering. 
13265,bartlet," That's right. His name is Norman Borlaug, by the way, and he won the Nobel  Peace Prize in 1970. "
13266,c.j.,"Thank you, Mr. President, President Nimbala. Thank you everyone. The press start to  disperse. "
13267,bartlet, I think you're absolutely right about the kind of miracle we need. I think  we're gonna make a lot of progress in the next few days. 
13268,bartlet,"It was called dwarf wheat, which produces heavy yields without its stalk falling over  from the weight of the rain. "
13270,bartlet,"What am I, Farmer Bob? It was wheat, and there was more than there used to be. "
13280,bartlet,"Leo, as hard as you might try, the Republican Party isn't going anywhere. "
13284,bartlet,"Charlie, I want to hire a woman whose voice I think would fit in nicely around here,  she's a conservative Republican. Do you think I should do it? "
13288,bartlet,"We might do that, Leo. A hundred million Republicans; we might hire as many as two of  them. But for now, hire this girl. "
13290,bartlet, I don't know. She's a lawyer. Put her in the counsel's office. 
13294,bartlet,"Appeal to her sense of duty. And smooth it over with the staff. Really, I don't want to  hear from them. "
13300,bartlet,"When they close the book on me and you, it will say that at this moment you were not  there for me, and for that, obviously, there'll be some kind of punishment. "
13319,c.j.,We'll do messages in a minute. 
13321,c.j., Don't make fun of me. 
13323,c.j., I didn't sleep much last night. 
13329,c.j., Let me ask you something. 
13332,c.j.,"Yeah.  Yeah. Listen, never mind. "
13333,c.j.,"Seriously, forget about it. "
13350,c.j.," Well, what the hell made you think I wouldn't scream where there are people?!"
13354,josh,There are a lot of people in Africa with HIV. 
13356,josh,American companies hold the patents on the medicines they need. 
13358,josh,"Most people in most African countries can't afford to buy the drugs at these prices, so  they buy them on the black market. "
13362,josh,They cost about a hundred and fifty bucks a week. 
13364,josh,A police officer in Kenya makes forty-three dollars a month. 
13366,toby, Let's make it the issue. 
13367,toby,"Let's make it the issue for the moment, please."
13368,toby,I think President Nimbala's saying that there's more money in giving a white guy an  erection than curing a black guy of AIDS. 
13369,toby,"They're not dying from eye infections, Alan. "
13370,toby,"Alan, if it was 26 million Europeans dying, we'd have had a solution yesterday. "
13371,josh,"How much would it cost for you to provide free drugs to the Sahelise Republic, Kenya, and  the Republic of Equatorial Kuhndu?"
13372,josh,"Why not? We're talking about a hundred and thirty thousand patients, two hundred  milligram pills, three times a day every day. What's the X-factor? "
13373,toby, We're nowhere. Let's take a break. 
13403,c.j.,"I rode the Lifecycle this morning for an hour and a half. If it was a real cycle, I'd be  in Belgium by now. "
13405,c.j.,"Sam, if I talked to you about it, you could be subpoenaed. "
13409,c.j., There's no problem. I just need  some sleep. What can I bring into the room about the conference? 
13411,c.j.,Are any of the parties optimistic? 
13433,josh,"You're listening to me, but you're not understanding me. "
13434,toby,"No, I'm disagreeing with you. That doesn't mean I'm not listening to you, or  understanding what you're saying. I'm doing all three at the same time. "
13435,josh,"You gotta get out of their face, Toby, they can get up any time they want. We don't have  anything they need. "
13436,toby,They need patent treaties to be enforced. 
13437,josh,And they are gonna be enforced. The pharmaceutical companies got half the House of  Representatives elected. Congress is gonna get serious about this. 
13438,toby,The pills cost 'em four cents a unit to make. 
13439,josh,You know that's not true. The second pill cost 'em four cents; the first pill cost 'em  four hundred million dollars. 
13440,toby,"They also enjoy unprecedented tax breaks, foreign tax credits, research and  experimentation exemptions, and expensing of research expenditures. To say nothing  of the fact that business is pretty good, so they're gonna cover their butt. "
13441,josh,Tell me about Nimbala. 
13442,toby,They didn't have cheese. 
13445,josh,Tell me about Nimbala. 
13446,toby,"He's a good President, Josh. He was a great soldier, a brilliant commander, he led his  people for 28 years, he can't get ahead of the curve. He's cursed by geography. You know  what, if the ground won't grow anything, you don't have an economy. Still, he stands in  a room and he talks about Norman Borlaug. He came here himself, Josh, he didn't send  delegates. I think it's 'cause he doesn't have any. I think he's holding his country  together with both hands. "
13447,josh,"Then let's make sure we send him back with something, is my point."
13450,c.j.,Good afternoon. Guess what? The aduit figures released yesterday by the Senate Finance  comfirmed earlier reports released by the Congressional Budget Office regarding the  increased budget projections. 
13451,c.j.,This exceeds even the most optimistic estimates published last year by the White House  budget office of 300 billion and the CBO's projection last quarter of 900 billion. 
13455,toby,They don't own wristwatches. They can't tell time. 
13456,toby,"Mr. President, may we speak with you alone, please? "
13457,c.j.,It's good to meet you. 
13460,c.j.,"Well, someone's gonna tell him eventually. "
13461,c.j.,One of the witnesses who was called. What could happen? 
13464,toby,"I'm gonna put a deal together, and I want you to agree to it. "
13465,toby,"I can get them to lower their prices - but you have to commit your military, your customs  bureau, and your Ministry of Health. You have to commit them to stopping the influx of  black market HIV drugs from Korea and Pakistan, and from wherever else they're coming. "
13466,josh,Mr. President. The U.S. Department of Commerce will put your country on a watch list.  That's the first step towards trade sanctions. Our Congress could end all aid to your  country. 
13467,toby,"Or you can agree to what we're saying. In exchange for which we believe we can get  Congress to forgive the debt, and all your past development loans, and we believe the  Export-Import Bank will offer a billion dollars in loans to finance the purchase of  American AIDS medication. "
13468,josh,"Congress won't have to, sir. The Treasury and the State Department will review it, but  if we spread the loans out over several countries in your region on a case-by-case basis,  and if none of the loans exceed a hundred million dollars, we don't need Congressional  approval. That law might change soon. "
13469,toby,"Yes he would, Mr. President. I swear to God, he would. "
13476,josh,You look familiar to me.  You're Ainsley Hayes! 
13480,josh,What're you talking about? 
13482,josh,What was he waiting for? 
13484,josh,You're not taking the job? 
13485,josh,"Hey, I'm still back on he offered you the job... but you're not taking the job? "
13493,josh,"Charlie, you seen Leo? "
13496,bartlet,"When do I see pictures, and who's gonna tell me what I'm looking for? "
13497,bartlet, I want Fitzwallace and Nancy. 
13498,toby," Donna, tell C.J. it's an open lid? "
13503,bartlet,"Mr. President, three hours ago there was a coup in your country. The AFRC has taken the  capital. "
13504,bartlet,"We're finding out. The information's coming very quickly now from our people in Angola  and Sudan. Mr. President, I think you should sit. "
13505,bartlet,"No, no, sir! My State Department is offering you asylum in the U.S. "
13506,bartlet,You can't go home. You can't go home! 
13507,bartlet,"They have the capital, they have the radio station, they have the television station. "
13508,bartlet,I'm evacuating the embassy. 
13510,bartlet,"I don't need to trade you! If they won't give me the Americans, we'll go and get 'em  ourselves, and they know that, and they'll let 'em go. "
13511,toby,"Your embassy is in exile, Mr. President. "
13512,bartlet,They will shoot you the moment you step off the plane.
13513,bartlet,"We think your brother and your two sons are already dead. We think your wife is being  hidden in Kenya. You understand, don't you, why I can't offer military assistance? "
13516,bartlet,They executed him in the airport parking lot. 
13517,bartlet,Okay. I'll see you Monday. He gets up and leaves the office. 
13521,josh,‘Cause you weren’t shouting.
13525,josh,They’re still saying that I owe them fifty thousand dollars and that   “failure to pay will result in a negative report on your credit.”
13533,josh,They’re referring me to insurance code 4336. You know what that means?
13535,josh,"Okay. Uh, there’s fifty thousand dollars worth of hospital bills they’re saying they don’t cover.  You know what that means?"
13585,bartlet,"That’s almost hard to believe, Donna.  How is everybody?"
13591,bartlet,"Thank you. Let’s do this in one, shall we?"
13593,bartlet,One-take Bartlet. That’s what old Jack Warner used to call me.
13594,bartlet,"Good morning. This month, as autumn is in full bloom in much of the nation, the weekends will  be devoted by many of you to leaf peeping and football... watch... ing... "
13595,bartlet, I’m sorry. Leaf peeping? Is that something we do now?
13598,bartlet,"Sorry, everybody. This is gonna be it. Four is my lucky number."
13600,bartlet,"Five is my lucky number. ""Fifth-take Bartlet"" -- that's what Jack Warner used to call me."
13602,bartlet,"Yeah, because I used to be a contract player in Hollywood and I'm 97 years old."
13606,toby,I'm fine. Thanks. Listen...
13607,c.j.,Have you noticed that I'm one of the few people around here whose nose isn't bent out of  shape over Ainsley Hayes?
13610,toby,"You heard the news and you slammed the door so hard it broke, okay? You heard the news and  you broke the White House."
13611,c.j.,"Yeah, but I'm over it now and I'm saying other people aren't and they should get over it."
13612,toby,I'll see what I can do. In the mean time...
13613,c.j.,"I'm going to tell you something, Toby: I don't think it's that she's a Republican, I think it's  that she's a Republican woman and she’s good-looking."
13614,toby,"Well, those are three things, when in combination, usually spell 'careerism,' but..."
13615,c.j.,"Well, I think it's sexist in a bad way, and I'm coming down on her side."
13617,c.j.,"Toby, I am serious about this!"
13618,toby,Ed Barrie is doing the Meet the Press on Sunday. Did you know that?
13621,c.j.,"He's retiring, maybe it's just a farewell retrospective kind of a..."
13622,toby,He's also doing Sam and Cokie Late Edition and Capitol Beat.
13623,c.j.,Are you sure about this?
13624,toby,Sam got it from Mark Gottfried.
13625,c.j.,Has anyone talked to Judy?
13626,toby,The DOD press office isn't confirming anything.
13627,c.j.,They won't confirm whether a three-star general is going on television to beat up the President?
13630,toby,"By the way, you are a beautiful woman. And no one around here has ever assumed you were either  ambitious or stupid."
13634,c.j.,I need to see General Barrie. I want you to go to the Pentagon and get him and I don't want  him anywhere near a press line when he comes into the West Wing.
13635,c.j.,I could give a damn if it's convenient or not.
13636,c.j.,"And I work for his boss, so get him here."
13640,c.j.,"Hey, has Leo told Tribbey about his new Associate Counsel yet?"
13641,toby,"I'll check the wire to see if any maimings have been reported, but I don't think he's told him yet."
13642,c.j.,Should be some decent dinner theater.
13643,toby,Let me know if you need me on Captain Queeg.
13669,bartlet,"'Our farming families stand for the values that keep our nation strong: faith, calm perseverance,  and patience...'"
13672,bartlet,"It's a bit of a bad time, Lionel..."
13673,bartlet,"And we will, Lionel, but right now I don't know if you noticed but there are thirty or forty  other people in the room, many of whom have donated significant amounts of money to the Democratic  Party, so perhaps you could put a tighter grip on your horses and we will talk about it later."
13674,bartlet,"Well, obviously, Lionel Tribbey is a brilliant lawyer whom we cannot live without, or there  would be very little reason not to put him in prison. Let's try again."
13675,toby,You've got two paragraphs on H-404 for the AFL-CIO. I want you to rethink them.
13679,toby,'Cause it's the AFL-CIO and they want to hear about how we're going to protect their jobs.
13681,toby,How about you start by cutting the paragraphs?
13685,toby,"His lung was collapsed, and blood stopped flowing to his brain, and he was supposed to dial up  the automated 24-hour customer care service line?"
13687,toby,"I like a country where you can sue the insurance company but not the people who shot you.   Anyway, cut the two paragraphs."
13690,toby,The people that shot him are dead.
13693,josh,When did he finally nail it?
13695,josh, He hasn’t done it yet?
13697,josh, What about the audience?
13699,josh,What the hell are we talking about?
13704,josh,"Insurance Victory!  “And the weak shall be made strong”, Donna, not “Might is right,”  but rather “Might for right”."
13706,josh,It doesn’t. Don’t eat my French fries.
13709,josh,Did you beat them into submission?
13711,josh,Did you beat them at all?
13713,josh,Unless the insurance company forgets about the insurance--
13715,josh,You could throw out the Bill of Rights.
13737,bartlet,"Good afternoon, Mrs. Landingham."
13739,bartlet,"Not for long, Mrs. Landingham."
13743,bartlet,Who cares? It’s been 14 weeks! Do these curtains close?
13745,bartlet,Yes. You’re right... where?
13747,bartlet,New Hampshire is an hour and a half away by plane. I don’t think I have that kind of time.
13749,bartlet, Yes! We have a bedroom right here in the building. That was so smart!
13755,bartlet,Oh God... I hate plutonium!
13759,bartlet,Where the hell is Cochran’s Mills?
13763,bartlet," I don’t think it’s gonna take more than a couple of minutes, but I like your  confidence."
13765,bartlet,Can’t we just close the curtains?
13770,c.j.,"Yes I do, so what are you doing here?"
13771,c.j.,I heard you the first time. Where’s the General?
13772,c.j.,"Well, I’m sending you back."
13773,c.j.,Is Ed Barrie doing the morning shows?
13774,c.j.,I would know and I do know. And so do you so cut the crap.
13775,c.j.,He’s gonna go on television and trash the President-that’s gonna be the last thing he does before  he retires?
13776,c.j.,Lieutenant! He’s gonna trash the President?
13777,c.j.,"My President is your President, too."
13778,c.j.," Well, that shouldn’t get too many people alarmed for no reason."
13779,c.j., It’s called “Ring and Run”.
13780,c.j.,"Go back to the Pentagon right now. Tell General Barrie, C.J. Cregg says he’s a coward."
13792,josh,And how are they tying the two shooters and the signal guy to the Klan?
13800,josh,I think we did have the Rockland memo.
13815,toby,"His point isn't wholly without merit, Leo."
13817,josh,Sam was talking to me. The Southern Poverty Law Center...
13820,toby,"Well, I'm not wild about it."
13822,toby,"Our people can be deposed too, which leaves them vulnerable to embarrassing questions like,  ""Have you ever tried cocaine?"" They can ask Sam has he ever slept with a prostitute?"
13823,josh,Those questions are irrelevant.
13825,toby,So we're not wild about it.
13827,toby,"""He is an Englishman"" is from Pinafore. Tribbey says it's from Penzance, by the way."
13829,toby,He says it's the one about duty.
13831,toby,I want to be very clear: I could give a damn.
13834,bartlet,Is this still my first term?
13838,bartlet,"It's evening. It's dark outside, Charlie."
13841,bartlet,Excuse me... No. I can't. I've got to go.
13843,bartlet,"Kids, I am so sorry. I have to go now, to a special meeting... of the government. I will mail  you all an autographed copy of the picture we took together. And one day, you will all understand."
13845,bartlet,I'm going to a special meeting...
13846,bartlet,Sure. Would you like to get that smile off your face before I send you on special assignment  to the Yukon?
13849,c.j.,"Sir, due respect, that wasn't what I was referring to. I think jumping up and down on the  Commander in Chief and then beating a path out of town is an act of cowardice."
13850,c.j.,"And I would too, sir, except -- and again, I say this with all due respect..."
13851,c.j.,"I say this with all due respect: I think your motives are personal, and I'd like to discuss  that, sir."
13852,c.j.,"No, sir, I think that's about the cold war ending ten years ago and America not needing to spend  quite so much money defending itself against a country that can't bake bread."
13853,c.j.,"Yes, sir. Pers-Tempo is up because higher paying civilian jobs are luring men and women trained  in high tech. We're more than happy to take the rap for a booming economy, sir."
13854,c.j.,"No sir. Again, with all respect, I hate to disagree, but it means unfit for service based on the  Pentagon's ""two war"" doctrine. It's based on how fast these divisions would be able to extract  themselves from their peacekeeping mission, retrain on home bases, and ship off to a second of  two, full-scale Gulf-War-sized conflicts. There are also some both inside and outside the  Pentagon who question whether the C4 ratings might not be a political maneuver on the part of  the DOD to help Republican allies in Congress secure more defense money. "
13855,c.j.,"No, I don't think you will, General. "
13856,c.j.,"I said, ""I don't think you will."" "
13857,c.j.,"Is there anything else, sir?"
13858,bartlet,"Guys, it's very important that nobody tries to kill me in the next hour or so."
13860,bartlet,I was on a conference call with Cardinal Law and the Archbishop of Chicago.
13862,bartlet,"Yeah. ""Excuse me, Your Eminence, but the First Lady is a little randy, and she says I'm good  to go""."
13864,bartlet," Good, take your clothes off."
13868,bartlet,"Abbey, you have two minutes, or I swear to God I'm gonna get Mrs. Landingham drunk."
13870,bartlet,What was that thing you were doin'?
13871,bartlet,"Tonight, in Pennsylvania."
13872,bartlet,"It was a monument dedication, a statue?"
13874,bartlet,"You went all the way to Cochran's... whatever to dedicate a monument to Nellie Bly? Abbey, you  can really pass that kind of thing along."
13875,bartlet,"You haven't changed into the ""special garment""."
13877,bartlet,"Yeah. You know what I did, just then, that was stupid?  I minimized the importance of the  statue that was dedicated to Nellie Bly, an extraordinary woman to whom we all owe a great deal."
13879,bartlet,This isn't happening to me.
13881,bartlet,Then she's the one I want to beat the crap out of.
13885,bartlet,"She sounds like an incredible woman, Abbey. I'm particularly impressed that she beat a fictional  record. If she goes twenty-one thousand leagues under the sea I'll name a damn school after her.  Let's have sex."
13887,bartlet,I couldn't possibly hear about the rest of the iceberg right now.
13889,bartlet,Keep talking. I'm just gonna sit here and think about plutonium and the things I can do with it.
13895,josh,"Sam, here's the thing. It's not just--"
13920,bartlet,"Do it live, that's what I always say."
13922,bartlet,"By the way, sweet knees, the Statue of Liberty."
13924,bartlet,Right there at the front door to the country!
13929,bartlet,"No, it's okay.  I'll be right behind you."
13933,bartlet,Is this about Ed Barrie?
13934,c.j.,"Yes, it is. I wanted to ask if..."
13935,bartlet,"Go ahead and let him out of the box. Say what you want about Barrie, and I could say plenty,  but the man was the first one in and the last one out of a war that I didn't want anything to  do with. Man's earned the right to say whatever he wants. Let him out of the box, would you?"
13940,josh,"It ties up the staff indefinitely when there are... I mean, there are other things that they  should be doing. I appear to be using a high-profile position for my personal agenda--"
13942,josh,"--but mostly I just, I just think a lawsuit is... too small. I can't have it be like I...  slipped in their driveway. It's different than that to me. I don't want to sue 'em."
13944,josh,Them I'll sue no problem.
13945,josh,Yeah? We're on our way.  She's here. Let’s go.
13946,c.j.,"No, I want to make it very clear that Mr. Konanov, while he's here in Washington is not  meeting with the Secretary of State or any Cabinet level official for that matter.  He's not meeting with the UN ambassador or any senior aides representing NATO allies.  And he's certainly not meeting with the President. He will be coming to the White House  to meet with some of the President's advisors on the Balkans. Who's next?"
13948,c.j.,"We'll have a fully ratified, comprehensive Test Ban Treaty."
13949,c.j.,"I think like all freshmen, Senator elect Mitchell will discover that he is one of  a hundred and that his power is considerably less than he would like it to be.  That having been said, the new Senate will ratify the Treaty and we really don't  care what condition his body is in when we do."
13951,c.j.,"Okay, anyone but Danny?"
13953,c.j.,"Danny, I don't know every thought that passes through the President's head, but there  have been no discussions."
13956,josh, She walked into it. She knows it too.
13958,josh,"She can't confirm that the President hasn't considered it less she asks the President  if he's considered it, at which point, he'll have considered it."
13960,josh,It was a better organized thought in my head. Is she done?
13970,josh,Mitchell's not a factor.
13973,josh,How do you change subjects so fast?
13975,josh,"No, I mean it. How do you go from a Test Ban Treaty and a Lame Duck Congress to OSHA?"
13977,josh,It shouldn't surprise you to learn that I do not.
13979,josh,"Donna, in the scheme of things, who really cares?"
13983,josh,"People who lose the ability to pinch, I got to tell you, I don't know from where  they summon the will to go on."
13985,josh,Aren't you one of 'you guys'?
13988,josh,You walked right into it.
13989,c.j.,"There was no other direction to walk. Now, please, just answer know to this question:  Has the President considered it?"
13992,josh,"Listen, not that I know of."
13997,c.j.,Mitchell isn't going to get a seat on Foreign Relations.
14002,josh,Casey wants appropriations. And he has the seniority.

14005,c.j.,Newberry leaving opens up Judiciary.
14009,josh,Vacating his seat on Foreign Relations.
14010,c.j.,"So? There's a seat open on Foreign Relations, that doesn't mean Mitchell's going to get it."
14015,toby,"Because there's no money in it. Senate Foreign Relations Committee has no control over  budget so there are no lobbyists, which means there are no fundraisers."
14016,c.j.,The Constitution says 'under extraordinary circumstances'.
14017,josh,It's a Treaty that's vital to national and global security. What kind of extraordinary  circumstances do you have in mind?
14019,josh,"Sam, you've been studying this, do you think we have any chance with the new Congress?"
14024,c.j.,"These people are gone. The 106th Congress is adjourned, twelve of them were voted out  of office. This is bad pool. You go in there now and tell the President to call a lame  duck session and he does, it's going to look like politics."
14028,c.j.,What are you going to tell the 12 people who are out there looking for new jobs?
14029,toby,They may not be done with their old ones yet.
14035,josh,Casey's gonna want Appropriations.
14037,josh,That means he's going to have to give up the Budget place.
14040,josh,Newberry'll take his seat on Judiciary.
14041,c.j.,Which means Weston leaves foreign relations.
14044,bartlet,It's like trying to run the country with Barnum Bailey and his sister Sue.
14045,bartlet,"Leo, will it be possible for just two of them to speak at once?"
14047,toby,"There was an hour and ten minute meeting with Dick Rush, Ed, Marty Beech and Henry  Rodriguez. I've never seen both political and legislative liaisons so unanimous in  a diagnosis."
14050,toby,"Mr. President, we have better chance of winning now than a month from now."
14055,toby,"Not only that but here's what C.J. can tell the press. The world is looking to the U.S.  to ratify the Treaty first. The longer we wait, the longer it takes other countries to  ratify. The closer we get to unstable countries like Pakistan developing a nuclear threat."
14058,josh,"The Senate'll be pissed off, they might stall confirmations."
14059,c.j.,And I can just add that a Senator Elect announcing what committee assignment he'd like  it not...
14060,c.j.,It's not what the founders would have considered an extraordinary occasion.
14062,josh,An extraordinary occasion...
14064,bartlet,Could I have a couple of aspirin and a weapon of some kind to kill people with?
14067,bartlet,What do you want to do?
14069,toby,"C.J., leak that the President's considering calling the Senate back."

14076,toby,Medicare coverage of clinical trials.
14082,bartlet,When does Konanov get here?
14084,bartlet,"No high level meetings, right?"
14088,bartlet,"Yeah, but this could be window."
14090,bartlet,We've got see if it's doable.
14094,bartlet,You got anything more to say?
14104,c.j.,That's four in two weeks.
14111,josh,A two page summary's gonna kind of cramp our style.
14117,toby,"Listen to me. I'm going to meet with Fox and Fowler. Sam, you're gonna go to the Hill."
14119,toby,"I think with Stensen gone I can get Fox and Fowler to loosen up some votes, That is if  I can ever get them to order lunch off of the damn menu."
14121,toby,"You've never seen grown men order lunch like this. Fox and Fowler'll loosen votes.  Sam, you're up on the Hill dropping we'll consider reservations. It is not out of  the realm of possibility that that meeting gets us eight votes."
14122,josh,Their bosses want to talk to the President? He's right by the phone.
14123,toby,So this is not an unimportant meeting.
14125,josh,"You can staff that, give it to Ainsley Hayes."
14129,toby,'Reservations' that's the word you're dropping when you're on the Hill. You're not to  leave the meeting in the wind. Just say the word.
14132,toby,Let's be able to end this day by telling the President that he's in striking distance  and he should seriously consider the session. Let's be able to do that.   Where's C.J.?
14133,josh,Looking for a reporter to leak the story to.
14135,c.j.,You guys launched another editorial.
14137,c.j.,"Well, that's convenient."
14138,c.j.,You expect me to do nothing about it?
14140,c.j.,Any reason I can't do both?
14141,c.j.," Carol, would you get me the spokesperson of the majority  leader's office?"
14144,c.j., We do a great deal of business with the majority leader's office.  He leads the majority.
14145,c.j.,I believe they'll track him down.
14147,c.j.,Certain sources inside the White House office of legislative liaisons who decline to be named.
14154,josh,"I'm not in charge of the science of ergonomics. You're going to have to find somebody  else who, you know, cares."
14156,josh, Because the SPA says the cost to small business could exceed 18  billion dollars in the first year. They'll be a huge increase in workmen's compensation  premiums. And republicans find the word ergonomics to be silly.
14158,josh,We do have a lot of pregnant teenagers and no health care.
14163,josh,"I can't see him. Charlie, make sure he's not in the building."
14167,josh,He's sitting in the driveway.
14212,josh,In a manner of speaking.
14217,josh,"Vasily Konanov is in the driveway, he's drunk, and he won't get out of the car until  he speaks to the President."
14220,josh,He's sitting in the car with a woman who I imagine is either a security attache or a hooker.
14222,josh," It's no one you know, Sam."
14224,josh,"I'm not allowed to speak to him. I've walked by the car a couple of times, to see what  was what."
14225,josh,"Leo, we've got to move him. Tourists are going to start to ask questions and Boris and  Natasha are going to answer them."
14239,toby,It's pureed squash. If it's not pureed then it's just squash.
14240,toby,I'll have a New York steak and a ginger ale.
14243,toby,And it would really tear the President up in side to bring them back. But I want to  talk about if he should.
14245,toby,We didn't have a vote before.
14247,toby,I'm saying what if there was a vote now without Stensen breathing down his neck.
14250,toby,82% of voters want the Test Ban Treaty!
14251,toby,You were guttered by the 18%?
14252,toby,"82% of voters, Joe. 82% of voters, to say nothing of 150 nations including Russia,  China, Great Britain, France. Four countries you don't often see on the same size  of the ball."
14257,toby,I don't have to make...  Who'd we lose?
14282,c.j.,The State Department and our new vocabulary.
14286,c.j.,"Okay, now you threw me off my game."
14289,c.j.,I feel like if I run over you're going to have the orchestra throw me off.
14291,c.j.,"State wants us to change 'rogue nations' to 'states of concern.' I say fine, it's a  symbolic gesture with no real consequence. It gains us points with allies who feel  we've been too harsh and it signals to the seven countries we're talking about that  we are open to taking positive steps in the future if they initiate reforms."
14295,c.j.,You certainly have so far.
14301,c.j.,No he can't have access.
14302,c.j.,"He can't have access. Leo, his editorial staff just jumped up and down on your head  yesterday, and last Thursday and the President twice before that. Four times in two  weeks! That's why everybody's walking around with a stopwatch. He gets no milk and  cookies."
14307,toby,We may be dead already.
14309,toby,We lost one of our people.
14311,toby,I don't know.  I need some help on the inside. Is Tony Merino in Philadelphia?
14313,toby,I'd like to call him and see if he'll get on a train.
14315,toby,I want out who we lost and can we get them back.
14317,toby,We lost one of our people.
14319,toby,"They wouldn't tell me, Leo, I need you to..."
14321,toby,Fox and Fowler wouldn't tell me who we lost they just said to check our back yard.
14323,toby,I don't know. Which is why I need to talk to Marino.
14325,toby,"Leo, I need you to talk to Marino."
14327,toby,I need you to call him and set up a meeting with me. He needs to tell me who jumped  the fence. He needs to help us bring them back.
14329,toby,He's going to want to come back for this.
14331,toby,Not on the Test Ban Treaty. He spent four years of his life on it.
14337,toby,"That this treaty want's bad. It can happen. Not only that but he can stick it to  every Pennsylvanian voters who put him out of a job and take Mitchell's knees out  before he has a chance to put his pencils in a jar. Plus, who'd we lose?"
14343,toby,"He'll know!  Leo, if it was anything less than pooling on the Test Ban Treaty  I wouldn't, but..."
14347,toby,Why are my blinds closed?
14348,josh,"Yeah! Yeah, that deserves an explanation."
14349,josh,"Mr Konanov, Mr Konanov, yes, right in here, sir, right in here. Mr Konanov..."
14350,josh,As a matter of fact I'm the Deputy Chief of Staff.
14351,josh,"It's actually, it's a very... it's a big.... Never mind. Mr Konanov, there's protocol,  your government has a leader we deal with."
14352,josh,We do wish to deal with you but right now President Shevschuck...
14353,josh,We're in touch with the embassy as well as the Capital. We are seeking permission  to have you speak with secretary...
14354,josh,Now that's not going to happen and you damn well know it!
14355,josh,"He's drunk, in my office and I will speak to him in what ever tone pleases me.   Donna!"
14356,josh, Put two uniformed agents outside my door. Tell Leo I'm coming over.
14358,josh," Oh, how I miss the Cold War."
14381,josh,"Well, there's been no evidence of that so far. Listen..."
14384,josh,"Well, I've got the 'man who came to dinner' in my office. I'm begging the Ukrainian  embassy for help. If I don't get some soon I'm going to apply for a job at the  Ukrainian embassy."
14386,josh,He can't meet the President.
14388,josh,How can he meet the President accidentally?
14390,josh,That's the most crazy ass thing I've ever heard.
14392,josh,This is how the world is run?
14394,josh,I'm sticking to domestic policy.
14396,josh, Is Toby meeting with Merino?
14398,josh,It's the right mission. I know you're not comfortable...
14400,josh,"They're all ethically grey areas, Leo. Screw it! If we're going to have a fighting  chance, we've got to invite Marino. Marino's going to want in because..."
14402,josh,I was going to say 'because Marino's devoted to the issue'.
14406,josh," Hey, Norma Rae! Get in here."
14407,josh, The man's trying to run a country.
14411,josh,The White House and Congress are exempt from the work place related laws they pass.
14417,josh,I've got a job for you.
14421,josh,I need Vasily Konanov to meet with someone of absolutely no consequence. You're my girl.
14423,josh,I need you to meet with Vasily Konanov.
14425,josh,So the President can drop in and interrupt you.
14435,josh,How do you usually feel about that?
14439,josh,You have enormous value to me. You have no value to Eastern Europe.
14447,josh,"Well, he's drunk, and he doesn't speak a lot of English so I don't think he'll  understand much of anything at all. But set up the meeting and knock 'em dead."
14452,c.j.,How'd it go on the Hill?
14458,c.j.,Toby's meeting with him right now.
14460,c.j.,Do you think I should give Danny Concannon access for a feature?
14477,toby,I appreciate your coming down.
14478,toby,The President's thinking about calling a session.
14480,toby,It's nice we found a use for our particular talents.
14481,toby,"Anyway, I had a meeting at lunch with Joe Fox and Bob Fowler, and they said we may  have lost one our guys, and I wanted to find out if it was true: who is it, and is  it important?"
14484,toby,"I don't... Tony, I don't understand. You changed your mind...?"
14488,toby,"Senator, there's no reason why you can't..."
14489,toby,Only because Mitchell painted another picture.
14490,toby,"Senator, nobody expects... you know... you're not expected to..."
14491,toby,"The whole damn world's flying apart at the equator, did you know that, Bonnie?"
14492,toby,"Why's the Test Ban Treaty so important? Well! Let me tell you. In 1974 India set off  a peaceful nuclear explosion. Indira Ghandi herself said they had no intention of  building a bomb, they just wanted to know that they could. 20 years later India set  off five nuclear explosions. Who gets nervous? Pakistan. When Pakistan get nervous,  everyone gets nervous, you know why? 'Cause we're all going to die!"
14502,c.j.,I'm supposed to see him.
14505,c.j.,"You leaked it for me, I leaked it to you, pal. I used you like so much whatever."
14506,c.j.,"Charlie, Danny's paper, after savaging us four times in two weeks would like access  so Danny can write a three part feature."
14507,c.j.,About winning a Pulitzer Prize for writing a three part feature.
14508,c.j.,"See reporters seldom win a Pulitzer, feature writers do. And the Post has been getting  a little out paced in the hardware department lately."
14510,c.j.,"Good evening, Mr. President."
14511,bartlet,"No more Rouge Nations, huh?"
14515,bartlet,"What's doing, Claudia Jean?"
14516,c.j.,"Mr. President, the Post would like access for Danny Concannon to do a three part feature  inside the Oval Office."
14518,c.j.,"No, I don't think it's a good idea, sir."
14520,c.j.,"Sir, after the Editorials they've run..."
14521,bartlet,"Yeah, they've been way off base."
14522,bartlet,"Not so much the second one. But the first, third and fourth were silly. And the fourth  was mean spirited."
14523,c.j.,"Exactly, so let's send them a message."
14525,bartlet,"First of all, it wasn't Danny."
14526,c.j.,Danny is their representative. We have to stop being a punching bag and they need a  wake up call.
14527,bartlet,Nah. It's going to look petty and petulant. You know why?
14529,bartlet,Because it's petty and petulant.
14530,c.j.,"Nobody elected this newspaper, certainly not the 48 million people who chose you to  be President."
14531,bartlet,"Yeah, but not having to run for anything tends to help with honesty and decisiveness.   Thanks, Charlie, send Danny in, would you please?"
14532,c.j.,"Mr. President, you have to send them a message."
14533,bartlet,"I really don't, C.J.  Is this personal?"
14535,bartlet,"I hear things, I don't understand most of it, but I hear it."
14536,c.j.,"No, sir, it's absolutely not personal."
14537,bartlet,"He's a great reporter, and you're a great Press Secretary. And that's why it was  never going to work while the two of you had those jobs."
14541,bartlet,"Danny, I think you guys have had your heads up your asses for the last few weeks,  I hope you don't mind me saying so."
14542,bartlet,"Not only that, but I think you've been trying to bait me. Which is a waste of time,  paper and ink. I'm like 50 times smarter than any of you will ever be. I have an  election to win in two years, and I'm not about to alienate the Washington Post."
14543,bartlet,"I'll tell you what I will do, though, I'm cancelling our subscription."
14544,c.j.,"Excellent, sir. The White House buys 1100 copies of the Post everyday. Cancelling  that subscription would send a message loud and clear."
14545,bartlet,"No, I meant just mine and Abbey's. I'll borrow a copy from somebody."
14546,bartlet,"Yeah. Take it easy, Danny.  C.J.'ll give you all the access you want."
14547,c.j.,"Thank you, Mr. President."
14548,c.j.,I know about the job offer.
14549,c.j.,Known about it for a couple of days.
14550,c.j.,You don't want to be an editor?
14551,c.j.,"I know. I just thought, by taking a job outside the press room..."
14552,c.j.," Well, I have a problem, so..."
14556,bartlet,"Vasily! Vasily Konanov, why you're the last person I expected to be where they told  me to go."
14560,bartlet, I don't know who this is.
14561,bartlet,What the hell are you doing?
14562,bartlet,"I'm not the transportation secretary. You will join the WTO when you reduce the 300%  tariff on America cars, and with a nuclear weapon pointed at my head I will not talk  to you about nuclear compatibility."
14563,bartlet,"Vasily, you're a reformer and you're going to do good things in Eastern Europe and I'm  looking forward to the day when you're President. But until that time comes, my State  Department deals with the government of the Ukraine. Now you can go home and so exactly  what you wanted to do.  To say you met with the President of the United States."
14594,bartlet,"Thanks, you can take off for the night, Charlie, we're done."
14596,bartlet," Tony Marino's going to abstain, huh?"
14598,bartlet,"He was a great public servant, Toby, a great Senator."
14599,toby,Didn't Nembenburg say that a representative owes not just his industry but his  judgement and betrays you if he sacrifices his judgement to yours?
14600,bartlet,Yeah. and then he was voted out of office five years later by the people of Bristol.
14601,toby,"That's not the point, sir."
14602,bartlet,"I know. The fact is the opponents of the treaty are on both sides of the isle.  You've got to respect them, Toby. They're politicians and they're flying in the  face of overwhelming public opinion."
14603,toby,I have to respect senators for defying 82% of American people.
14604,bartlet,"Can I tell you something, honestly? This is one of those situations where I couldn't  give a damn what the people think. The complexities of a global arms treaty, the  technological, the military, the diplomatic nuances, it's staggering, Toby. 82% of  the people cannot possibly be expected to reach an informed decision.  You  want to call a session anyway?"
14605,toby,"No.  No. If we lose, and we will, we're out of."
14607,toby,"No, sir. Thank you, Mr. President."
14608,bartlet,"You know we forget sometimes, in all the talk about democracy we forget it's not  a democracy, it's a republic. People don't make the decisions, they choose the  people who make the decisions. Could they do a better job choosing? Yeah. But  when you consider the alternatives, anyway, Abbey's in New Hampshire, you want  to come up for a cigar?"
14609,bartlet,"The day's over, Toby. We'll live to fight another one. Come up, and I'll beat  your ass at chess."
14610,toby,"Are you baiting me, Mr. President?"
14613,bartlet," If anyone's out there, I'm signing off. Have a good night."
14614,bartlet,He wants to meet with me on the way back? 
14616,bartlet,The Assistant Energy Secretary is flying to Portland in the middle of the night so he  can meet with me on Air Force One on the way back? 
14617,bartlet,The day-to-day experience of my life has changed in many ways since taking this job. 
14618,c.j.,"Before we get on the plane, let me give you a couple of additions to the passenger  manifest. Gerald Wegland, the Assistant Energy Secretary, is now on the flight, as  well as Mr. Latham, the head of The White House Military Office, or WHAMO, as we have  apparently taken - over my strong objection - to calling it.   Also, on this evening's trip are Deputy Communications Director Sam Seaborn and,  well, me. "
14619,c.j.,I am now going on the trip. 
14620,c.j.,"I'm not being punished, I'm going on the trip. "
14621,c.j., I made fun of Notre Dame. 
14622,c.j.,I usually get away with it! 
14624,c.j.,"Well, I'll have a lot of time to think about that on the midnight ride to Portland,  Danny. The wheels-up is 905. We'll touch down in Portland a little before midnight  local time. "
14630,bartlet,You didn't say 'Michigan sucks'? 
14632,bartlet,I thought you said 'Michigan sucks.' 
14638,bartlet,You think they've got oil? 
14642,bartlet,Anything else I should know? 
14644,bartlet,I'll see you tomorrow night. 
14648,c.j.,"Good evening, Mr. President. "
14649,bartlet,I think it's great you decided to make the trip. 
14650,c.j.,"I believe I was ordered to, Mr. President. "
14651,bartlet,"Yes. I remember now. You made one of your funny, funny jokes. "
14656,c.j.,"Sir, I'm wearing Max Mara. It's going to break up the... "
14658,c.j.,Please let nobody see me like this. 
14664,josh,You told him about the tanker? 
14666,josh,"He likes long flights, he gets to talk to everybody and think out loud. "
14668,josh,"Yeah, so... well, then he lands.  Anyway, I'm going to meet with Matt Skinner. "
14672,josh,"Yeah, but it creates a Federal Definition. "
14674,josh,Yeah. Are you sticking around tonight? 
14676,josh,Okay. I have to go. Donna is about to cease the phone. 
14678,josh,Leo. He likes long plane rides. 
14680,josh,Can I have the electricity back on? 
14684,josh,Not for me. Matt Skinner's coming down from the Hill. 
14686,josh,Two minutes ago. Did you have plans? 
14692,josh,You weren't wearing that during the day today. 
14694,josh,Did you steal that dress? 
14696,josh,But you're returning it tomorrow. 
14700,josh,After wearing it once. 
14704,josh,And felonious. What are your plans? 
14708,josh,"No problem. You can do all those things except for the drinks, the dancing, and the  dessert. "
14710,josh,I need you to be done with dinner in an hour and five minutes. 
14712,josh,"If you wanna have sex, you'd better do it during dinner. "
14714,josh, You met him for five minutes at a party. 
14718,josh," Actually, you have NO sense about these things! You have no vibe,  you have terrible taste in men, and your desire to be coupled up will always and forever  drown out any small sense of self or self-worth that you may have. "
14720,josh,Be back by the time I'm done with Skinner! 
14728,toby,For the past three weeks! 
14732,toby," We'll be eating in the conference room. I'll have a club sandwich, Jack Daniels  and ice. "
14734,toby,You have to have something. 
14736,toby, Bring him a club sandwich. 
14739,toby," Sam and I are going to work for a little bit, you'll have draft copies to  distribute to the press in about three hours. "
14740,c.j.,It was already distributed. 
14742,c.j.,It was already distributed. 
14745,c.j.,They know you're polishing it... 
14747,c.j.,I'll tell them there's a new draft and then you should... 
14749,c.j.,They're not going to read it! 
14754,toby,"C.J., try to get it back.  C'mon. "
14757,c.j., We've got pasta... salad? 
14760,bartlet,What does the island of Qais mean to you? 
14761,c.j., I know it's known as a rendezvous point for Iraqi oil  smugglers. 
14762,bartlet,"About two hours ago we stopped a Cyprus-flagged ship called ""The Nicosia."" We believe  it to be carrying petroleum products out of Iraq, in violation of UN sanctions. "
14763,c.j.,What do we do when that happens? 
14764,bartlet,"We board the stip, we test a sample of the oil, we determine its point of origin and  if it's black-market, the oil company gets fined. "
14765,c.j.,Don't they also get to sell the oil? 
14767,c.j.,Doesn't the profit of the sale exceed the fine? 
14768,bartlet,It dramatically exceeds the fine! So what do you think we should do? 
14769,c.j.,"If you're going to have sanctions, have sanctions. There should be genuine disincentive. "
14772,bartlet,It would please me if you would lead the press in a rendition as we pass over South Bend. 
14774,bartlet,"All five verses, please. "
14783,josh,Temporarily. She's having dinner. 
14784,josh,I guy she has no future with. 
14785,josh,Because I say so. You want some coffee or something? 
14786,josh,Yeah.  It's too bad this is going to be rushed. 
14787,josh,It's too bad we're talking about this for the first time right now. 
14791,josh,That government will define marriage as a union between a man and a woman. 
14792,josh,While doing nothing to prohibit it? 
14794,josh,"When this bill was being discussed on the floor, there were some very ugly things said  about homosexuals. "
14795,josh,"They were said by members of your own party. In fact, they were said by one of the guys  who escorted you here tonight, who's sitting out in the lobby. "
14796,josh,You support this bill? 
14797,josh,Congressman... you're gay! 
14811,bartlet,What are we trying to do? 
14813,bartlet,All right. The F-18 pilots? 
14815,bartlet,"Leo, just so they know--it's a tanker full of crude oil. If they miss the propeller and  hit something else--- "
14823,bartlet,Okay. Why don't I have a final draft of tomorrow morning's...? 
14835,toby,Right.  It's an easy fix. All we need to do is...
14843,toby, Where have I heard that? 
14849,toby,You think we should quote Mao Tse-tung? 
14851,toby,"Still, I think we'll stay away from quoting Communists. "
14859,toby,"We had six months. We're not doing it half-assed, we're not doing it tonight. Let's go. "
14861,toby,"Up and down the plane, get the blood flowing. "
14891,josh,"Public opinion can be wrong, Matt. The public opposed interracial marriage and school  integration. You want me to reach back into the nostalgia file? "
14893,josh,Freedom of choice isn't a minority value just because the majority doesn't agree with  the minority's choice. 
14900,josh,32 States have passed laws banning same-sex marriage. The States are doing a fine job  protecting themselves from a radical social agenda without a federal shield. 
14901,josh,I like you guys who want to reduce the size of government and make it just small enough  so it can fit in our bedrooms! 
14903,c.j.,How's everybody doing? 
14905,c.j.,"I'm not sure. The President had a budget meeting earlier, maybe they were expecting it  to run long, I'll find out. Listen, I'd like you to give me back the draft copies of the  morning education speech. We're going to replace them. "
14906,c.j.,Toby and Sam are doing some work. 
14907,c.j.,They're just polishing the language. 
14908,c.j.,"There isn't a policy shift, there isn't a new program, this is Sam being Sam. "
14909,c.j.,"Nothing's forced changes in the speech, there are no policy shifts and no new  initiatives, I guarantee you. Carol? "
14922,bartlet,It's a northeastern thing? 
14923,bartlet,What about Miami and San Francisco? 
14925,bartlet,So pavement's going to win this battle? 
14929,bartlet," Ernesto Perez Balladares, former President of Panama. You know where  he went to school? Notre Dame. "
14930,c.j.,"Yes, sir, also Joe Garagiola. "
14932,c.j.,"No, sir. I understand you'd like to hear the song now? "
14933,bartlet," Yeah, but we gotta do it later. The Tokyo Exchange just opened  and I'm gonna gauge the impact on Pacific Rim Banking Reforms. A subject economics  scholars could take years on, I will take 20 minutes. "
14934,c.j.,"Speaking of which, Mr. President, I was asked about the late departure tonight. "
14935,bartlet,I thought we left on time. 
14936,c.j.,The late scheduled departure. 
14937,bartlet,You don't like late flights? 
14938,c.j.,"No, I was just repeating- "
14939,bartlet,A long flight across the night? You know why late flights are good? Because we cease to  be earthbound and burdened with practicality. Ask the impertinent question. Talk about  the idea nobody has thought about yet.  Put it a different way. 
14941,bartlet,If you absolutely must. 
14948,bartlet,"Mao took a lot of long plane flights, Toby. Look out your window. Is there anything more  romantic than that?  "
14949,c.j.,And that's why we left at 905? 
14950,bartlet,"No, we left at 905 because they thought my budget meeting might run over. But wouldn't  that have been great if that was the reason? "
14952,bartlet," You don't like ""permanent revolution""? "
14953,toby,"It's a nifty phrase, but I think if we call for a permanent revolution, people  are, you know, gonna expect one. "
14954,bartlet,"We're flying, Toby. Live a little.  Yeah? "
14955,bartlet,"Oh, Leo, just take the damn boat... "
14981,josh,You're going to quote the bible to me? 
14984,josh,The founding fathers made it very clear that they didn't want Judeo-Christian morality  within 10 city blocks of the law. Matt!  
14985,josh,"Nothing.  You understand that gay partners will be permanently ineligable for  survivor benefits, Medicare, Medicaid.... "
14986,josh,So we caught a break there.  
14989,c.j.,Did you get the old drafts back? 
14994,c.j.,"What's the problem, Danny? "
14995,c.j.,"Everybody else gave it back, Danny. "
14996,c.j.," I'm guaranteeing you all no substantive  changes, no new policy initiatives. "
14997,c.j.,"It was the budget meeting, by the way. "
14998,c.j.,The reason we took off late. It was the budget meeting. Although there's something to be  said for...  something to be said for... 
15000,toby," ""I was raised to appreciate the value of teachers and teaching.  My grandmother, who began her teaching career in a one-room schoolhouse..."""
15001,bartlet,"Actually, it was two rooms. "
15003,bartlet,Italian stonecutters were paying her to teach their kids English in the basement of the  rectory. They put up a wall and made it two rooms as a thank you gift. 
15004,toby,We'll change it to two rooms. 
15005,bartlet,I haven't heard the big idea yet. 
15006,toby,"Sir, the speech is in pretty good shape. "
15007,bartlet,"Yeah.  What  happened to 100,000 new teachers? "
15012,toby,"There aren't a 100,000 new teachers. We can't make people be teachers. "
15013,bartlet,We can give incentives. 
15014,toby,In certain public districts there are tax incentives... 
15015,bartlet,"Well, it's not doing the trick. "
15016,toby,No. No. I know. But for right now... 
15024,bartlet,I find fault with that formula. 
15027,bartlet,Why can't that idea be floated? 
15028,toby,Anybody know how we pay for it? 
15030,toby,"Yes, it does come next, so for the moment why don't we... "
15033,bartlet, I'll be in my study. It's an incredible sky tonight. 
15034,josh,58% of the people say that gay spouses should receive health benefits and 54% say Social  Security benefits and by the way we haven't talked about the 14th amendment. 
15035,josh,I think a strict interpretation of the Equal Protection Clause would dictate that  homophobia can't be made into a law. 
15036,josh,Lawrence Tribe disagrees with you. 
15038,josh,What does that have to do with it? 
15039,josh,The Senate's not in session. The President could stick this in his pants pocket and  it's vetoed. 
15041,josh,"He compared homosexuality to kleptomania and sex addition, Matt. "
15042,josh,The Majority Leader. The leader of your own party. 
15044,josh,How can you be a member of this party?!? 
15045,josh,This party who says that who you are is against the law. 
15046,josh,"That's a heck of a strategy, Matt. I'll bring that up in a meeting. "
15048,toby,The speech is fine now. 
15052,toby,It's an overly simplistic... 
15056,c.j.," But, I just told them... "
15059,c.j.,Excuse me. I need to go look like an idiot. 
15060,toby,"We're not floating a policy initiative, Sam. I don't care if it's a trip to the moon on  gossamer wings. "
15062,toby,It's pie in the sky to say nothing of patronizing to have privileged Ivy Leaguers play  teacher to America's most vulnerable children. 
15064,toby,How do you suppose the teacher's union will feel about it? 
15066,toby,All of whom will leave after three years. 
15068,toby,And the kids will be abandoned as well. 
15070,toby,Their teachers will leave! 
15076,toby,Sam! Where are we getting the money?   Where are we getting the money? 
15078,toby,Yeah.  You should've told me a few days ago. 
15083,josh,Talk to me about the Full Faith and Credit Clause. 
15084,josh,"So, how is the Marriage Recognition Act not unconstitutional? "
15090,josh,I'm going to tell him to sign the damn thing. 
15093,toby,He's frustrated. He's feeling... 
15094,josh,"You know when he goes off on a thing Toby, he expects you to bring him in. He wants you  to do it so he doesn't have to do it himself. "
15095,toby,"Josh, off the top of your head, what do you think about tuition incentives for... "
15098,josh,"No, I mean, what were you going to..."
15100,josh,All right. I'll talk to you later. 
15101,josh,I'm gonna talk to Leo. 
15111,josh,An obnoxious insurance lobbyist? What were the odds? 
15115,josh,"You look really great in that dress tonight, Donna. You should buy it for yourself. "
15119,bartlet,It doesn't do anything to hold the ship in Bahrain 
15121,bartlet,"Yeah. You know what's going to happen? They'll sell off the cargo in a friendly port.  780,000 metric tons of gas oil against a two million dollar fine for the oil company. "
15123,bartlet,Which their profits from the sale will more than cover. We're not providing much of a  disincentive to evade U.N. sanctions. 
15125,bartlet,"If we're going to have sanctions at all, I think we should make them stick. I think  that we should confiscate the cargo, seize the ship, sell the oil and use the money  to beef up anti-smuggling operations. "
15127,c.j.,"We're landing, Mr. President. "
15133,josh,The Marriage Recognition Act. 
15135,c.j.,"Folks, we'll be landing in just a few minutes. Follow the blue signs to your bus.  Oh, one thing before we land, when I said before that there'd be absolutely no policy  shifts or new initiatives in the education speech tomorrow... That was correct, except  it's possible there might be a policy shift or new initiative in the education speech  tomorrow. "
15136,toby,There isn't going to be a change. 
15137,toby,There isn't going to be a change!  Danny? 
15138,c.j.,He's not going to give it back. 
15139,toby,"Danny, Sam choked hard on the last draft and wants to burn it. "
15143,c.j.,"You were just having a little go at me, weren't you? "
15144,c.j.,So you decided to kill time by... 
15145,c.j.,Tell me you went to Notre Dame. 
15146,c.j., There must be an escape hatch here of some kind. 
15147,josh,The constitutional argument... 
15148,bartlet,I don't care about the constitutional argument. It's gay bashing. It's legislative gay  bashing. How do I put my name on it? 
15149,josh,"I wouldn't, sir. I'd put it away. "
15150,bartlet,Pocket veto's a politician's way out. 
15151,josh,"They'll send the bill again when they're in session. Meanwhile, we focus on the  Employment Non-discrimination Act. "
15152,bartlet,"If I'm going to sign it in January, why am I vetoing it now? "
15153,josh,As a symbolic gesture to the gay community. 
15154,bartlet,I'm sure the gay community can't wait to thank me. 
15158,bartlet, You can look at the policy numbers and Article IV and Social Security  benefits. It doesn't matter. It's just wrong. We shouldn't be defining love and we  certainly shouldn't be ill-defining it. It's wrong. This is the job for... This is the  job of somebody else. 
15162,bartlet,I should get out a rubber stamp that says 'Josiah Bartlet votes no.' 
15163,josh,That's just what the conservatives are hoping you'll do. 
15164,bartlet,I should get out a rubber stamp! 
15168,josh,"Thank you, Mr. President. "
15174,josh,"Hey Leo, Margaret mentioned... "
15178,josh,It seems like a pretty good reason to. 
15180,josh,You wanna have coffee someplace? 
15191,c.j.,"For a sidebar, on the game tomorrow. "
15192,c.j.,Why did you go to Notre Dame? 
15194,c.j.,"Bearing in mind that I'm just repeating someone else's question. You were accepted at  Harvard, Yale, and Williams. Why did you go to Notre Dame? "
15195,bartlet,Because I was thinking about becoming a priest. 
15200,c.j., Why don't you ever give me answers like that when we're running  for something? 
15201,bartlet,Because I like to bother you. 
15202,c.j.,"Well, I shall not be defeated. "
15207,toby,Here's the final draft. 
15208,bartlet,"Toby, you should sit down. We're landing in one minute and ten seconds. "
15210,bartlet,I set my watch to the cockpit computer. You should sit down. 
15212,bartlet,Do you know why the Assistant Energy Secretary is on the plane? 
15213,toby,You have a meeting with him on the way back. 
15215,toby,I think Charlie's idea was a good one. I think you should ask Leo to put together a team  to study the feasibility of appropriations for a pilot program with 100 teachers. 
15216,bartlet,They're taking the tanker to Bahrain and then the company's going to make a profit. 
15218,bartlet,The Marriage Recognition Act is going to be law. 
15224,bartlet,"Well, it's a start I guess. "
15231,toby,Do you see me laughing?
15236,c.j.,"Have either of you heard of... uh, I don’t know, something, the... Jamestown Mayflower  Daughters of the American Revolution Preservation Soceity?"
15237,toby,The Jamestown Mayflower Daughters?
15238,c.j.,"I may have gotten the name wrong. They’re inviting the White House to participate in  some kind of... I don’t know, Thanksgiving Revolutionary War re-enactment."
15239,toby,"C.J., let’s not torture American History completely to death."
15241,toby,Jamestown was the 16th century. The Mayflower landed at Plymouth in the 17th century.  The Fathers of the Daughters of the American Revolution fought in...?
15243,c.j.,It’s a festival feast of some kind! Who cares?
15245,c.j.,Re-enactments and proclamations and Native American cornhusks hanging contests with native...
15247,c.j.,Whatever. I’m the Thanksgiving cruise director around here.
15249,c.j.,I wasn’t here last year.
15251,c.j.,They sent me home last year. You don’t remember me having a 102.7-degree fever and having  all kinds of flu-like symptoms?
15253,c.j.,"That’s ‘cause every time we come up on a holiday, you guys check out like seniors who are  done with finals."
15254,toby,We are writing a very important Thanksgiving proclamation.
15256,toby,Nobody here has checked out.
15257,josh," Hey, I was just flipping a nickel in my office. Sixteen times in a row, it  came out tails."
15261,josh,Sixteen times in a row.  Yeah.
15269,josh,I’d definitely put them in C.J.’s office.
15273,toby,"Well, C.J.’s office is right there..."
15274,josh,C.J. handles all the...
15279,toby,"And Morton, Ms. Cregg is gone for the night, uh, and her office is secure, so you should  feel free to let the turkeys out of the cage, and allow them to, you know, roam freely,  as they were meant to do."
15282,josh,Show her who’s slacking off. 
15288,josh,It's an 800-foot container ship called the Horizon. Eighty-three Chinese were stowed away  in containers in the hold.
15290,josh,Thirteen of them died on the way.
15292,josh,They came over with the 83 lives ones. INS has them in a temporary detention facility  by the water.
15294,josh, You doing anything for Thanksgiving?
15296,josh,Toby and Sam and I are gonna watch football.
15298,josh,"Yeah. Leo, do me a favor, would you? Don't tell the President we're just watching football.  He'll want to invite us for dinner."
15300,josh,"I'm just saying, we've been working hard and we'd prefer to watch football rather than  listen to a history of the yam in Latin."
15307,josh,About a hundred Chinese stowed away in a cargo hold of a container ship. INS has them in  a temporary internment camp in San Diego.
15308,c.j.,I'll need more than that.
15309,josh,"I don't have more than that, but I will in a few minutes, so stay out of the pressroom  until you talk to me."
15310,c.j.,What about the recess appointments?
15311,josh,Toby wants to talk to you about adding a name.
15316,c.j.,Is this as a favor to Leo?
15317,josh,This is Toby sniffing around for a fight on school prayer.
15318,c.j.,He'll get one. 					 Josh hangs back as C.J. heads toward her office.
15319,c.j.,"Well, I'm gonna see what's next for me in this week of unendurable Thanksgiving nonsense."
15339,c.j.,Why are there two turkeys?
15343,c.j.,I don't want to know their names.
15347,c.j.,And I'm to choose the more photogenic of the two to receive a Presidential pardon.
15349,c.j.,"Okay, I have actually a Masters degree from the University of California at Berkeley."
15353,c.j.,Okay. I'd like to be alone now.
15362,bartlet,"Chef's choice. Twice the amount of carbon, which means it'll hold a sharp edge up to  ten times longer and you can see the handle which texturized molded polymer has no  rivets or air pockets."
15363,bartlet,This is an American knife.
15364,bartlet,No German knives for us.
15367,bartlet,"Nah... Nah. No, the balance isn't right."
15368,bartlet,Yeah. You know what we need?
15370,bartlet,You tell him they already briefed me on San Diego.
15373,bartlet,"The German's know how to make a knife, Charlie!"
15375,toby,She's been put on a lot of short lists. Why not pull the trigger?
15376,bartlet,She's a controversial woman.
15378,bartlet,It is when it's a recess appointment. A recess appointment assumes the Senate's gonna have no  problem with the nominee. The Senate is going to have a considerable problem with this nominee.
15379,toby,That's the Senate's problem.
15381,toby,"Mr. President, you want to have a debate on school prayer?"
15384,bartlet,"I got to say... look, I'm just... Toby, I'm not wild about the woman. I've known her for 25  years and I think she's all about Eve."
15385,toby,"Well, I wouldn't cast her in a play, but at the Department of Education..."
15387,toby, You want to have a debate on school prayer?
15395,toby,"Leo, we're adding a name."
15399,bartlet,Assistant Secretary for Primary and Secondary Education.
15407,bartlet,"Not patronate, yet she's qualified."
15409,toby,"Which she is. Ph.D. in education, six years as a principal, four years as superintendent  and a significant Democrat!"
15413,toby,"We are geared up for it, and if we're not we should get out!"
15415,toby,I'll take the meetings.
15417,josh,"Excuse me, Mr. President."
15421,josh,"Mr. President, there's a wrinkle in the situation in San Diego."
15423,josh,You're not gonna believe it.
15427,josh,They're seeking religious asylum.
15430,josh,"The Christian community is gonna scream that they've got to stay, China's gonna say send  them back, INS is gonna say the law's a law. This is a whole new thing."
15432,c.j.,"Well, the INS conducts something called a “credible fear interview.” This is not a hearing  on whether or not to grant asylum, just a hearing to determine if the detainee has a  credible fear that they’ll be harmed if returned to their country."
15434,c.j.,"Yes, we will. On the following days, we will be meeting with Reverend Al Caldwell, members  of Beijing's Embassy and INS agents. The president has asked Josh Lyman and Sam Seaborn  to run these meetings so it’s entirely possible that by week’s end we’ll have alienated  Christians, China and our own government. "
15435,c.j.,"That’s all I have on the refugees. I was going to release the list of recess appointments,  but I’m going to wait a day.  I can tell you the list has been sent to appropriate committee  chairs and I imagine one of them will leak it to you some time this afternoon. "
15436,c.j.,"I’ll also remind you that it’s Thanksgiving week, which means the traditional presidential  pardon...you know...of the chosen turkey. That will be Wednesday afternoon. Thursday morning,  the president will make his Thanksgiving proclamation in the Rose Garden. Among the guests  will be members of the Boys and Girls Clubs of America and members of the Big Brothers and  Big Sisters of America."
15438,c.j.,"Yes, of course I will be leading them in song for I am the press secretary. "
15440,c.j.,I’ve got to learn some songs.
15441,josh,Don’t bring it up at the meeting.
15443,josh,Don’t bring it up at the meeting.
15449,josh,Don’t bring it up at the meeting.
15453,josh,"Good morning, Reverend Caldwell."
15455,josh,"Good morning everyone. Welcome. Good morning, Mary. "
15456,josh,"Okay, we’re done with good morning. "
15457,josh,The president doesn’t grant asylum requests. The INS judge does.
15458,josh,"Mary, I swear to God, you are not going to get anywhere in this building threatening me."
15474,josh,"Well, we may be talking about more money..."
15475,josh,"Okay. Thank you, Reverend. I’ll pass that along."
15476,toby,"Good morning, Reverend."
15478,toby,You knew you were getting faxed a list of recess appointments.
15479,toby,"Article 2, section 2. “The president shall have the power to fill all vacancies that may  happen during the recess of the Senate by granting commissions which shall expire at the  end of their next session.”"
15482,toby,"It’s Mr. McGarry. And her name is Dr. Josephine McGarry. She has a Ph.D. in education from  Cornell. She’s published many scholarly essays on public education. She was superintendent  of the Atlanta School District servicing 58,000 students with some of the highest test scores  in the country. What in particular troubles the senators you  work for about her resume? "
15483,toby,I do but I’d like you to say it.
15485,toby,Hmm. She’s on the board of visitors at her church. She teaches Sunday mornings at the  Immaculate Heart of Mary School.
15488,toby,"You wanna know who else is against it? The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Organized  prayer in public schools is prohibited and your problem with her is that while superintendent,  she enforced the law."
15489,toby,"Laws don’t work like that, Wayne. We don’t ask for a show of hands."
15490,toby,"No, I don’t. Can you explain it to me slowly using small words and visual aides?"
15491,toby, Senate Reublicans will hold up confirmations of other nominees.
15492,toby,Neither is the filibuster. I’ll put down my gun when you put down yours.
15493,toby, So... hold up all the appointments you  want. Shut down the government because a teacher did as she was told. You’ll have given  us a second term and we won’t even have to leave the building. But not because I’m right  and you’re wrong. Although I am and you are. But because I am better at this than you are.
15496,toby,"It was a home game, there was an organized prayer and she’s breaking it up."
15498,toby,"It's not good, but it's not, you know--"
15500,toby, He's resting it on his nightstick.
15508,toby,It's not like we weren't aware of the incident.
15526,toby,It brings the problem front and center.
15537,c.j.,Can I borrow you for just a minute?
15539,c.j.,Hey I'd love to stay around and talk with you but I have a turkey pardoning in 5 minutes.
15540,josh,I thought that was tomorrow.
15541,c.j.,No tomorrow's the singing.
15543,c.j.,I'm leading the children in song.
15545,c.j.,Yes. I need Donna for a moment.
15546,josh,You need help with the song?
15547,c.j.,I don't need help with the song. Donna?
15551,c.j.,I need help with the song.
15561,c.j.,"Yes, right before being a National Merit Scholar."
15565,c.j.,You're not the one conducting a musical on CNN.
15569,c.j.,"Not now, right now I have, you know, actual serious work to do. "
15570,c.j.,"Okay, it's show time guys. I've observed you under a number of conditions, and this is the  final. I don't like you wigging out in the President’s face I just don't like the photo, so..."
15571,c.j.,"You both did fine. Troy, I want you know it was neck-and-neck but I'm giving it to Eric. You  were in it right to the end but it's the flapping thing you've got going on. I tell you what's  of some concern to me, had I been talking out loud this whole time, that's very unsettling."
15572,c.j.,"Okay, Eric, here we go."
15573,c.j.,"Come on Eric, let's go."
15575,c.j.,"Well I don't know where his hindquarters are and I'm not going to look that hard.  Come on Eric... Come on, down. "
15577,josh,"$40,000 buys them a spot in a container?"
15580,josh,They have to pay off the smugglers when they get here so they become indentured servants. 
15582,josh,You should know that Al Caldwell and the Christian League have offered to pay their bonds.
15595,bartlet," The Missermeister. Meridian 3000 series. One-piece forged blade,  riveted palm handle."
15596,bartlet,I don't like the handles.
15599,josh,"Sir, we've taken a couple dozen meetings in the last two days. "
15600,bartlet,You met with Chinese embassy officials?
15601,josh,Last night. They say...
15602,bartlet,"Christians aren't persecuted in China. Since they aren’t oppressed, they don't qualify  for refugee status."
15603,josh,Under U.S. or U.N. Conditions here.
15606,josh,The INS agents also feel it's not uncommon in this situation for refugees to... How do I  put it... Feign faith. 
15607,bartlet,Yeah. They'll be coached.
15608,josh,So how do you tell the difference between...?
15609,bartlet,"Do you guys know what a ""shibboleth"" is?"
15612,bartlet,"It's from the Bible. ""Then said now unto him, say now “shibboleth"" and he said ""sibboleth""  for he could not frame to pronounce it right."" It was a password, the way the army used to  distinguish true Israelites from impostors sent across the river Jordan by the enemy."
15614,bartlet,I'm having one of the Chinese refugees flown here. I'll meet with him tonight.
15615,c.j.," Mr. President, I can't, you know, indefinitely, with the turkey."
15617,josh,"Excuse me, Mr. President, what are you going to ask the Chinese refugee?"
15618,bartlet,"I'm going to ask him to say ""Shibboleth."""
15640,toby,Josey was the wrong face to put on this.
15642,toby,"But I'll tell you why it should be front and center. It's not the first amendment,  it's not religious freedom, it's not church and state, it's not... abstract..."
15644,toby,It's the fourth grader who gets his ass kicked at recess 'cause he sat out the voluntary  prayer in homeroom. It's another way of making kids different from other kids when they're  required by law to be there. That’s why you want it front and center; fourth grader;  that's the prize. 
15650,toby,What are you doing for dinner tomorrow? 'Cause Josh and Sam and I are watching the game.
15652,toby,"Okay.  Hey Leo, do me a favor, don’t tell the President  that we're just..."
15658,bartlet,He speaks English. He’s a chemistry professor.
15660,bartlet, There was a while there I wanted to be a chemistry professor.
15662,bartlet,I never actually studied chemistry.
15666,bartlet,I’m Jed Bartlet. This is Leo McGarry.
15668,bartlet,Thanks for coming all this way.
15670,bartlet,Would you care to sit down? It’s perfectly all right.
15671,bartlet," There are some sandwiches here. If you get hungry, feel free to  eat as much as you want."
15672,bartlet,There are questions as to the veracity of your claim to the asylum.
15673,bartlet,How did you become a Christian?
15675,bartlet,Who’s the head of your church?
15676,bartlet,"Can you name any of Jesus’ disciples?  If you can’t, that’s okay. I usually can’t  remember the names of my kids, or for that matter..."
15677,bartlet, It was a pleasure to meet you.
15681,bartlet,We don’t have to grant asylum.
15687,bartlet,Before... when it happened before... how did it work?
15690,bartlet,I need to talk to the Governor of California.
15692,c.j.,We’re starting in five minutes. You can move the press to the Rose Garden.
15695,toby,You’re learning the song?
15697,toby,You don’t know the song?
15698,c.j.,“We gather together to ask the Lord’s blessing. He chastens and hastens his will to make known.”
15699,toby,You know what it means?
15700,c.j.,I don’t have to know what it means.
15701,toby,"Listen. I don’t know what you’re doing for dinner tonight, but Josh and Sam and I..."
15702,c.j.,"It’s about damn time you asked me! I have been sitting here for two weeks turning down  all kinds of very, frankly, glamorous invitations from people I like more than you. You  can’t ask a girl at the last minute..."
15703,toby," Well, if you can’t come..."
15704,c.j.,No. I can come. I can come. I can come.
15706,c.j.,Should I bring anything?
15707,toby,"Yeah. Do you know how to, you know, cook food?"
15708,c.j.,We’re in the Rose Garden in five minutes.
15711,c.j., No. No. These turkeys are going to a petting zoo in Delaware.
15712,c.j.,"Yeah, but I’m gonna send both of them."
15714,c.j.,"Right, but I’m gonna take them both."
15715,c.j.," I’m gonna buy them from you. What’s he, 30 bucks?"
15719,c.j.,Give them a different turkey.
15721,c.j.,"Yeah, and I chose Eric because Troy doesn’t like to be touched, which, surely we’re not  gonna execute him for."
15723,c.j.,"Grab the turkey, and come with me."
15724,bartlet,"Mrs. Landingham, can I look at a copy of the Thanksgiving proclamation?"
15726,bartlet,I was standing at the door.
15727,bartlet, Can I look at a copy...?
15730,bartlet,I once test-drove the Komin Yomada.
15731,bartlet,Not wild about it--How about this?
15732,bartlet,"Because it’s something we pass on. Something with a history so we can say, “My father  gave this to me. His father gave it to him, and now I’m giving it to you.”"
15737,bartlet,"Charlie, my father gave this to me, and his father gave it to him, and now I’m giving it to you."
15739,bartlet,The fully tapered bolster allows for sharpening the entire edge of the blade.
15740,bartlet,Yeah. This was made for my family by a Boston silversmith named Paul Revere.
15742,bartlet,"I’m proud of you, Charlie."
15748,c.j.,"I’m sorry to ask you this, sir."
15749,bartlet,Not too late to stop yourself.
15750,c.j.,I need you to pardon a turkey.
15751,bartlet,I already pardoned a turkey.
15752,c.j.,I need you to pardon another one.
15754,c.j.,"You did it great, but I need you to come out here and pardon another one."
15755,bartlet,Aren’t I gonna get a reputation for being soft on turkeys?
15756,c.j.,"Sir, could you come out here and just get this over with?"
15757,bartlet,"No, I’m not just gonna get this--What the hell is going on?"
15758,c.j., They sent me two turkeys. The most photo-friendly of the two gets a  Presidential pardon and a full life at a children’s zoo. The runner-up gets eaten.
15759,bartlet,"If the Oscars were like that, I’d watch."
15761,bartlet,Just buy the second turkey.
15763,bartlet,There’s not much I can do.
15764,c.j.,You can pardon the turkey.
15765,bartlet,The turkey hasn’t committed a crime.
15767,bartlet,"C.J., I have really no judicial jurisdiction over birds."
15768,c.j.,"Yes, I know that, and you know that, but Morton Horn doesn’t know that."
15770,c.j.,He’s a high school kid from the turkey place.
15771,bartlet,He’s in high school and he doesn’t know I can’t pardon his turkey?
15772,c.j.,That’s what I’m betting.
15773,bartlet,"C.J., if we don’t and I mean completely overhaul public education in this country..."
15774,c.j.,"Yes sir, but maybe this is not the best time to..."
15777,c.j.,"Morton, this is President Bartlet."
15779,bartlet,Well said. Is that the turkey?
15785,bartlet," By the power vested in me by the Constitution of the United States,  I hereby pardon you."
15788,bartlet,"Morton, I can’t pardon a turkey. If you think I can pardon a turkey, then you have got  to go back to your school and insist that you be better prepared to go out in the world."
15790,bartlet," No. I tell you what I can do. I’m drafting this turkey into military service.  In the meantime, somebody will be drafting a check, which will have my signature on it,  so the folks can buy themselves a Butterball."
15791,c.j.,"Donna, will you have Morton take Troy back to his pen, and remember to support his hindquarters."
15792,bartlet, What’s wrong with him?
15793,c.j.,The turkey’s hindquarters.
15794,bartlet, I’m still waiting for the thing.
15799,c.j., I’m gonna step out there and begin the singing and lute playing.
15800,josh,I’m assuming you’ve heard?
15801,bartlet,"By the way, the Latin word for “yam” is “dioscorea.”"
15803,bartlet,About the Chinese refugees?
15805,bartlet,Yeah. Can you believe it?
15806,josh,"No, as a matter of fact, neither one of us can believe it, sir."
15807,bartlet,"That detention center was being guarded by the 22nd Division of the California National  Guard. Now, what does it say about our reserve army?"
15810,bartlet,"“Well over three and a half centuries ago, strengthened by faith and bound by a common  desire for liberty, a small band of pilgrims sought out a place in the New World where  they could worship according to their own beliefs. Now therefore I, Josiah Bartlet,  President of the United States, by virtue of authority and laws vested in me, do hereby  proclaim this to be a National Day of Thanksgiving.”"
15812,josh,You asked the Governor to stand down the 22nd Division.
15813,bartlet," And call in the Red Cross. We didn’t do anything illegal.  We’re not involved in any massive criminal conspiracy. There’s no way I was letting  them go, and we needed to help China save face, so now they can tell their people that  the mighty American military was overpowered by..."
15815,josh,"So the guy passed the test, huh?"
15816,bartlet,"You think I would’ve sent him back if he’d failed catechism? Let me tell you something.  We can be the world’s policeman. We can be the world’s bank, the world’s factory, the  world’s farm. What does it mean if we’re not also..."
15817,bartlet,"We’ve made it into the New World, Josh. You know what I get to do now? I get to proclaim  the National Day of Thanksgiving."
15823,bartlet,You can feel the adventure. 
15825,bartlet,NASA's great at naming things. 
15827,bartlet,"Mercury, Apollo, Atlantis, the Sea of Tranquility, the Ocean of Storms... "
15829,bartlet,"First time I heard ‘Galileo V,’ the way the imagination immediately... It reminded me of the  way folks in my generation felt when we heard ""Yellow Submarine."" "
15831,bartlet,We really did all want to live in a yellow submarine. 
15832,c.j.,I can't believe they gave you people drivers' licenses. 
15833,bartlet,Tell me where we're going again. 
15834,c.j.,Mars briefing rehearsal. 
15839,bartlet,"Say it again. Your imagination, like a child, will explode with unrestrained possibilities  for adventure. "
15841,bartlet,You didn't say it right. 
15852,c.j.,"Sir, this is the crew from NASA Public Affairs. "
15854,c.j.,"Sir, we're going to run you through the drill for tomorrow morning. First of all, you'll be  flanked on either side by the Flight Operations Manager David Narakawa and NASA Chief  Administrator Dr. Peter Jobson. On either side of them will be Dr. Samuel Thurman of the  Meteorite Analysis team from the Johnson Space Center, and Dr. Joyce Grey-Sutton, Planetary  Geologist from Cal State Northridge. On these monitors you'll be seeing the images beamed  back from the surface and on this computer screen you'll be able to read the questions being  sent in by the kids. I strongly urge you... "
15856,c.j.,I strongly urge you... 
15858,c.j.,"I strongly urge you, Mr. President, to act as moderator and pass the questions of to one of  the experts on the panel rather than answer it yourself. "
15860,c.j.,Would you like to see some of the questions? 
15861,bartlet,We have questions in advance? 
15862,c.j.,Some of them. Would you put them on? 
15863,bartlet,"Katie, sixth grade, Green Oaks Junior High School, Austin, Texas, asks, ""How old is the planet  Mars?"" That's a great question, Katie. The planet Mars is 4.6 billion years old. "
15866,c.j.,Nobody likes a know-it-all! 
15867,bartlet,"Yes, God forbid, that while talking to 60,000 public school students, the President should  appear smart! "
15868,c.j.,That's fine. Just don't show off. 
15869,bartlet,"I don't show off.  Stevie, fourth grader, PS 31, Manhattan, asks, ""What is the  temperature on Mars?"" Well, Stevie, if one of our expert panelists were here, they would tell  you the average temperature ranges from 15 degrees to minus 140. "
15870,c.j., That happens to be wrong. It ranges from 60 to minus 225. 
15871,bartlet,I converted it to Celsius in my head. 
15875,bartlet," ""Good morning! I'm speaking to you live from the West Wing of the White House. Today  we have a very unique opportunity to take part live in an extremely historic event which...""  Whoa, boy... "
15878,bartlet," Scott. ""Unique"" means ""one of a kind."" Something can't be very  unique, nor can it be extremely historic. "
15879,c.j.,"While we're at it, do we have to use the word ""live"" twice in the first two sentences like we  just cracked the technology? "
15880,c.j.,"We're also broadcasting in living color, right? "
15883,bartlet, He's gonna make some changes. 
15888,josh,"I don't understand how if it's noon in the East, and 9 Pacific, how it's 2:37 on Mars. "
15889,toby," Well, Mars is a different time zone. "
15890,josh,"Yeah, it's the 37 minutes I was... "
15891,toby,Mars rotates on it's own axis every 24 hours and 37 minutes. 
15893,toby,Have you seen this morning's news report? 
15896,josh,I didn't... see anything about the green beans.  
15897,toby,The Milwaukee Journal is quoting an unnamed White House source as saying the President doesn't  like green beans.  
15898,josh,That's a pretty slow news day in Milwaukee. 
15900,josh,It's not gonna be picked up by... 
15904,josh,"Oh Leo, ask me how long a Martian day is. "
15914,josh,There's a Citizen's Stamp Advisory Committee? 
15916,josh,Made up of members of the There-But-For-The-Grace-of-God-go-I Club? 
15918,josh,I want to mock people. 
15923,toby,Then what's the problem? 
15924,josh,"He advocated statehood, right? "
15926,toby,Give it to somebody else! 
15930,toby,Well he can wait on a line around the block! Even while I have two of my 20 teller  windows are open! 
15934,josh,"Nothing, I just... Toby got the stamp assignment.  "
15935,toby,"Leo, I might need some help. "
15938,josh,"Wow, that happened fast. "
15941,c.j., A Martian year is 687 days. 
15942,toby,Yes.  Did you see this morning's news report? 
15943,c.j.,I'm boning up on my Mars. 
15944,c.j.," He thinks he's so smart just because, you know, he's so smart. "
15945,toby,Did you see this morning's...?
15946,c.j.,Of course I saw the news report! I highlighted your copy! 
15947,toby,You didn't highlight the green bean story! 
15948,c.j.,"No, I thought it was best just to alert Justice Department Officials. "
15949,toby," ""An unnamed White House source..."" "
15950,c.j.,I read the story. I just didn't highlight it. 
15951,toby,You don't think this is gonna get picked up? 
15954,c.j.,It is absolutely not a story! 
15955,toby,Come see me in three hours. 
15957,toby,See me in three hours. 
15958,c.j.,How many moons does Mars have? 
15959,toby,"Two. Phobos and Deimos, the two horses that pulled his chariot. "
15963,toby,She wants information on green beans. 
15966,c.j.,Nobody likes people who know everything! 
15967,toby,So I've discovered in my life! 
15968,c.j., Get me information on green beans. 
15970,bartlet,"Okay, but then, let's bring the curtain down. I got a great night planned. I got two books  on Mars and one on Galileo himself. I'm gonna go to the Residence and read. "
15971,bartlet,"Nothing after 6:30. I'm gonna go to the Residence and read about Mars, which while colder  and drier, has four Earth-like seasons. "
15976,bartlet,Did Buddy Holly come back? 
15977,bartlet,The Reykjavik Symphony Orchestra? 
15979,bartlet,"I know where Reykjavik is, Charlie. I wish I was there right now."
15981,bartlet,The Reykjavik Symphony Orchestra? 
15989,bartlet,"Which we did, by canceling the meeting yesterday. "
15991,bartlet,"So to make up for it, I'm going to see the Reykjavik Symphony. "
15993,bartlet,"With, uh, Ambassador... "
15997,bartlet,I'll give you a thousand dollars if you don't make me go. 
16008,bartlet,There was an explosion?
16010,bartlet,What's the problem Jack? 
16012,bartlet,It's not a refinery fire? 
16014,bartlet,There was an explosion in a missile silo? 
16015,bartlet,"If a missile exploded, is it possible it was armed? Was there a warhead? "
16018,bartlet,"Did they really think we weren't gonna see it, Leo? "
16020,bartlet,"If they asked, we could help. "
16022,bartlet,"Yeah. Yeah. Galileo Galilei. He sat in a cathedral in Pisa. He watched a lamp suspended from  the ceiling as it oscillated back and forth. He used his pulse to keep time and discovered  that the period of oscillation was independent of the size of the arc. A few years later he  contradicted the theory that a heavier body falls faster than a lighter one. Which took some  guts back in 1609, when you consider that the theory he was contradicting was Aristotle's. "
16024,bartlet, I really do. Have Sam and C.J. come along tonight. 
16027,bartlet,"He contradicted Aristotle, Charlie. "
16041,josh,I’m sorry. What’s fun? 
16043,josh,Careful how you say that cause... 
16045,josh,Tell me what you know. 
16047,josh,"Well, that’s always our first mistake. "
16051,josh,Let’s put you on a stamp. 
16053,josh,Let’s talk about the problem. 
16055,toby, Two hours and 20 minutes. 
16056,c.j.,Yes. Let me say first that you were right and I was wrong. 
16057,toby,And the odds makers take a beating. 
16058,c.j.,When I said before no one was going to pick it up? 
16060,c.j.,Everybody’s picked it up. 
16062,c.j.,"And when I said that even if they did, it wouldn’t be a big deal? "
16064,c.j.,"Turns out, it’s a bit of a deal. "
16068,c.j.,In Oregon. You know why? 
16069,toby,Because they’re a major producer of green beans? 
16070,c.j.,"They’re a huge producer, Toby. Green beans, or snap beans, represent a significant percentage  of Oregon’s annual revenue. But here’s the thing...  "
16071,toby,There’s an electoral problem? 
16072,c.j.," There’s an electoral problem. We won Oregon by less than 10,000 votes and  we’re going to need them. "
16074,c.j.,"Okay, well, I’m on it now. "
16076,c.j.,"So, you know what? It took me two hours and 20 minutes longer to figure it out than it took you.  That doesn’t make you smarter than me. "
16079,toby,"My S.A.T. scores, on the other hand... "
16080,c.j., I’ve got to go start spinning the green bean problem. 
16082,c.j.,I had fine S.A.T. scores. 
16088,c.j.,We’re landing a probe on Mars. 
16098,c.j.,There’ll be State Department people there. 
16100,c.j.,I just added a new deputy. Most of the people I interviewed were from State. The Kennedy  Center is going to be packed to the Potomac with people I just rejected. 
16105,c.j.,Would you have somebody go to my apartment and pick up my blue Armani? 
16109,c.j.,The President wants us to go to the Kennedy Center concert tonight so we can discuss broader  themes for the televised classroom. 
16113,c.j.,"Oh God, does it rain on Mars? "
16115,c.j.,The White House should develop a broader theme. 
16117,c.j.,Mallory’s going to be there. 
16119,c.j.," God, Sam, I would think that faced with the privilege of attacking with  energy due the moment... "
16121,c.j.,"Well, I’m afraid -- as we used to say in my hometown -- that’s just hard cheese. "
16123,c.j.,"Hey, that is like the fourth time I’ve been called dumb today. "
16125,c.j.,You haven’t spoken to her since the picture? 
16127,c.j.,What about the shooting? You didn’t see her at the hospital? 
16129,c.j.,"Sam, didn’t I tell you not to get a crush on the boss’ daughter?  "
16134,bartlet,What do you think happened? 
16136,bartlet,Where are we with the Russian ambassador? 
16137,bartlet,"Leo, I want you to see her as soon as she can get here. Thank you everybody. "
16141,bartlet,We lost the signal from Galileo. 
16143,josh,"Yes, but we have to remain neutral. "
16145,josh,"I understand that it’s a stamp but I’m saying when it comes to statehood for Puerto Rico,  the United States has to remain neutral. "
16147,josh,"Once again, thanks for that review of fifth grade social studies. But I meant the federal  government must remain neutral. "
16151,josh,Who can’t vote. But that’s beside the point. 
16153,josh, Aquino was strongly in favor of statehood. To put his face on a  stamp would be promoting his beliefs. We can’t do that. 
16157,josh,"Oh, like it’s the first time. "
16161,josh,Mississippi’s never minded being relegated to second-class status. 
16165,josh,"Exactly no one is worried about that. You know why?  Because Puerto Rico is absolutely  dependent on U.S. manufacturing, which contributes 40 percent to the GDP and accounts for 24  percent of their workforce. "
16171,josh,I think we can take ‘em.  
16178,toby,"They know it entered the Martian atmosphere at 3:01 p.m. Eastern, which it was supposed to do. "
16179,toby,"They know it was on course traveling at a rate of 15,400 miles per hour, which it was supposed to.  Somewhere during its descent it was also supposed to release two probes -- each about the size of  a basketball -- firing them deep into the ground as part of the mission’s search for evidence of  water under surface. "
16180,josh,"We think if we hit the ground hard enough, we can make it to the center of the planet and find  water? "
16182,josh,That’s not a theory of physics pretty much disproved by Wile E. Coyote? 
16183,toby,The probes were supposed to send a signal back to Earth through the Global Surveyor Orbiter. 
16184,josh,And we haven’t gotten the signal? 
16185,toby,"The last the flight controllers heard from Galileo was 11 minutes before landing, when all  systems were operating normally. Then it entered what they call a communications blackout  period and it hasn’t been heard from since.  I know how it feels. "
16187,toby,They’re... uh... trying the things they try. I’m going to give it an hour and then tell Leo  we got to cancel the classroom. 
16191,josh," You were supposed to do this, you know. "
16196,c.j.,I have to go to the Kennedy Center to be with people who don’t like me. 
16197,toby,You can do that right here. 
16201,c.j.,The President wants to discuss broader themes for the classroom. 
16202,toby,I don’t think there’s going to be a classroom. 
16203,c.j.,The President’s holding out hope. 
16205,toby,"Well, that’s 20 seconds of my life I’m never going to get back. "
16217,bartlet,Do you know what they’re playing? 
16218,bartlet,The Reykjavik Symphony. Do we know what they’re playing and for how long they’re playing it? 
16221,bartlet,Modern music sucks. Anything written after 1860 sucks. 
16225,bartlet,Played on teapots and gefilte fish. 
16226,bartlet,"If he wants more time, I’d be happy to take a rain check. "
16227,bartlet,This is not classical music. It is not classical music if the guy finished writing it this  afternoon. 
16230,c.j.,Sam and I will be talking about it. 
16231,bartlet,I don’t get that many opportunities to talk with kids. 
16232,c.j.,"Sir, at some point, I’m going to have to pull the plug to give everyone enough notice. "
16233,bartlet,"Yeah, but let’s let 'em work for a while. "
16236,c.j.,Upstairs hiding from Mallory. 
16237,bartlet,Why is he hiding from Mallory? 
16238,c.j.,Do you really want to know? 
16256,bartlet,"I took trombone lessons when I was a kid. Not much solo music written for the trombone,  but I wanted to play in the marching band. "
16257,bartlet,"One afternoon, during the game, I gave it all I had and ended up throwing the slide into the  end zone, which is more than I can say for our quarterback. "
16258,bartlet,Would you excuse me just one moment? 
16268,bartlet,Yeah.  Somebody was draining hydrogen? 
16274,c.j.,"They said modern music. I thought they meant, you know, Jackson Browne."
16281,c.j.,What question did they ask?
16283,c.j.,Did you leave any wiggle room?
16284,c.j.,"We won Oregon by 10,000 votes. I don’t know how many green bean farmers they have out there,  but if there are 10,001..."
16285,c.j.,This is a serious thing now.
16287,c.j.,"Everybody’s stupid in an election year, Charlie."
16288,c.j.," All right. Look, just, from now on, there’s no food the President doesn’t like, okay?"
16289,c.j.,I have to take this outside.
16290,toby,Where are you right now?
16291,c.j.,I’m out in back. I’m on the terrace. I passed Gary Saunders on the way out. He booed me.  I swear to God. I passed by. He went “boo!”
16292,c.j.,He’s the Deputy Spokesperson at the Department of Energy.
16293,c.j.,"I promoted Simon Glazer. I promoted from within, Toby."
16294,toby,"Anyway, they’re hypothesizing that the thing came down at an odd angle, and that its position  might be preventing the antennae from establishing a downlink. They say it’ll take a few days  to try everything they want to try."
16297,toby," Look, if this is the worst thing that happens..."
16298,c.j.,No. Tad Whitney’s coming over to me.
16299,c.j.,"Oh, God. He’s got me in his tractor beams. He’s walking right over."
16300,c.j.,I’m not very good at confrontation.
16301,toby,You have no problem with me.
16302,c.j.,"This time of year, is the water in the Potomac very, very cold?"
16303,toby,"Yeah, but if you rub chicken fat all over yourself, it’ll insulate."
16304,c.j.,Don’t hang up. If it seems like I’m talking...
16305,c.j.,"Yeah, okay. Well, we’re gonna put those figures out at the morning briefing... Yeah. Thank you. "
16306,c.j.,I... you know... I honestly couldn’t tell you.
16307,c.j.,Yeah. There’s some stuff going on.
16308,c.j.,I gave it to Simon Glazer.
16309,c.j.,I promoted from within.
16310,c.j.,Promoting from within is very big in my family.
16312,c.j.,"Well, no. Simon Glazer’s a man."
16314,c.j.,"Tad, it honestly was a matter of Simon...  No! Of course it didn’t have anything to  do with... That was six weeks, five years ago."
16316,c.j.,I don’t need an explanation.
16317,c.j.,"No, I didn’t think it was, Tad."
16321,c.j.,"Tad, you know, I’m sorry you didn’t get the job, but there’s really no..."
16323,c.j.,"I have a number of problems today, and you’re not close to being any of them."
16324,c.j.,I have to go. You’re gonna get a briefing in about an hour.
16325,c.j.,A Russian missile silo.
16327,c.j.,"Well, when we run for reelection, I’d vote for somebody else."
16329,josh,“The flight manager at J.P.L. will be working round the clock until all hope is exhausted.”
16340,josh,Can you describe what she’s wearing?
16342,josh,So you want to get off the phone?
16362,c.j., Let me see what you got.
16364,c.j.,Can I talk to Jason Stark?
16373,josh,"Right, and what happened?"
16385,josh,"No, but I’d pay good money to see that."
16391,josh,"Uh, are you gonna get that?"
16393,josh,Yeah. I didn’t think we still had buffalo scouts.  Josh Lyman.
16402,bartlet, Your paranoia was a lot sexier back when you guys are communists.
16403,bartlet,"From where do you get the nerve and try to dictate terms on this? Are you insane? Your missile  regimen is in a horrifying state of disrepair. Your best-trained operators have left or died.  The ones you’ve got aren’t paid very much when they’re paid at all. They don’t have enough to  train with. Your ICBMs are well behind their warranty life. Not seven weeks ago, you mistook  a Norwegian weather rocket for a submarine launch Trident missile because the CrossTac  information never made it to the Russian C&C system.  Leo, at the time the  S.S.19 exploded, it was being drained of its liquid hydrogen in an attempt by deserting  soldiers to -- wait for it --"
16405,bartlet,Steal the warhead!  When were you gonna tell us about that? You realize how dangerous...
16406,bartlet,"Well, I am concerned with the welfare of the Russian people, but that’s not what they pay  me for. You guys fall asleep in the switch in Minsk, and I’ve got a whole hemisphere hiding  under the bed. How do you not tell us this is going on? How do you not ask us for help?"
16407,bartlet,"Yeah, thanks. We’re sending in NATO inspectors."
16409,bartlet,Get your Foreign Minister on the phone.
16410,bartlet,I really don’t know from where you guys get the nerve.
16411,bartlet,"This is still my office, right?"
16412,toby,"Sir, we have some press things for discussion."
16415,bartlet,Earth’s giving it instructions?
16417,bartlet,Like my kids. All right...
16418,c.j.,"Sir, that leaves us with the televised classroom, the green beans..."
16420,c.j.,"...the stamp, and depending on who those people were that were standing near me, the  possibility of a story about me being good in bed."
16427,toby, Let’s do a photo-op with the President... eating green beans.  We can drop in a quote. He’s always looking for new green bean... recipes.
16428,josh,"Next time we’re in California, we schedule a pop in Oregon, make sure nothing’s burned down."
16429,bartlet,"Yeah, okay. What about the stamp?"
16430,josh,"Here’s the thing, the Citizen’s Stamp Advisory Committee..."
16431,c.j., He doesn’t like green beans.
16433,c.j.,"I’m sorry, sir. Nothing."
16434,josh,The Citizen’s Stamp Advisory Committee...
16435,c.j.,"No, I’m sorry. I said you don’t like green beans, sir."
16436,c.j.,"He doesn’t enjoy them. He doesn’t think they’re bad for you, and he doesn’t think the people  who make them are evil. They’re simply not his cup of tea. He doesn’t care for them. Why do  we think the adults of Oregon would be okay with that if put to them just that way?   And Josh, why do you think the people, adult Americans, why do  you think they can’t understand that we can honor a man’s contribution without necessarily  subscribing to his politics? They can understand a lot of things. People stopped trusting  the government during Vietnam, and it was because government stopped trusting them. It’s a  cautionary tale, Josh."
16437,josh, Okay. I was gonna say I think we should put them on a stamp.
16440,bartlet,All right. Everybody go away. We’ll call you back when there’s a NASA update.
16442,c.j.,"Thank you, Mr. President."
16444,bartlet,Did you hear the end of the concert?
16445,c.j.,I didn’t hear much of the concert at all. How was it?
16446,bartlet,"Well, first of all, let’s not kid ourselves. The Reykjavik Symphony can play. These guys have  some serious game. In this particular case, their talents were tragically misapplied to an  atonal nightmare of pretention, but after intermission..."
16448,bartlet,"They played a piece by a new composer. First, I wasn’t hearing it. I had 19 different things  on my mind, but then I did, and C.J., it was magnificent. It was genius. He built these themes,  and at the beginning, it was just an intellectual exercise, which is fun enough, I guess,  but then in the fourth movement, he just let it go. I really didn’t think I could be surprised  by music anymore. I thought about all the times this guy must’ve heard that his music was no  good... I’ve got to write this guy a letter."
16449,c.j.,"Mr. President, about that televised classroom tomorrow..."
16450,bartlet,I’m gonna wait up for a while. See if we hear anything. It’s out there somewhere... It’s so close.
16451,c.j.,I think you should do the classroom either way.
16453,c.j.,"We have, at our disposal, a captive audience of schoolchildren. Some of them don’t go to the  black board and raise their hand ‘cause they think they’re gonna be wrong. I think you should  say to these kids you think you get it wrong sometimes, you should come down here and see how  the big boys do it. I think you should tell them you haven’t given up hope, and that it may  turn up, but in the meantime, you want NASA to put its best people in the room, and you want  them to start building Galileo VI. Some of them will laugh, and most of them won’t care, but  for some, they might honestly see that it’s about going to the blackboard and raising your hand.  And that’s the broader theme."
16455,c.j.,"I’ll be in my office, Mr. President."
16457,bartlet,You said it right that time.
16465,josh,I was wondering why there were two of you.
16467,josh," I-I uh, I cut it putting down a glass."
16473,josh," Tulsa, Hurricane Beth, the Chatham fires, the Iowa tornadoes, the FBI raid  in Rock Creek."
16474,josh,"Dr. Keyworth, I’m the Deputy White House Chief of Staff. I oversee 1100 White House  employees. I answer directly to Leo McGarry and the President of the United States.  Do you think you’re talking to the paperboy?"
16475,josh,In your wildest dreams did you imagine that I’d walk in this room without knowing exactly  who you are and what you do?
16476,josh,Then why did you lie to me right off the bat?
16477,josh, She’s not here training!
16478,josh,I read briefing books everyday on subjects considerably more complicated than ATVA.
16479,josh,"Yeah, but that’s not why there are two of you."
16480,josh,That’s not the reason why there are two of you.
16481,josh,"I get up, go to the bathroom, go to my office, answer the phone -- one of you watches me."
16482,josh,"Stanley, you got off to a bad start."
16484,josh,You gonna lie to me this time?
16493,josh,"The shooting took place at Rosslyn, Virginia, not Rosalyn."
16495,josh,I always thought it was San Franchisco.
16498,josh,Everybody was with me. We’d just gone to a Town Hall meeting. We’d just gotten off  television.
16499,josh,The President travels with a large group of people.
16500,josh,"It was geared to young people. There were Department of Education people, event staff,  obviously C.J. Cregg and the press corps, Leo McGarry was there, Bob Shanahan, Toby  Ziegler, Ziegler’s deputy Sam Seaborn, Zoey Bartlet was there obviously, Charlie Young..."
16501,josh,"Stanley, I walked out of the building, I heard gunshots, people started screaming, I woke  up in a hospital room."
16502,josh,I don’t know what you’re referring to.
16503,josh,"Well, I’ve been concerned with their behavior since long before that."
16504,josh,They were talking about the pilot.
16505,josh,"Robert Cano, the Air Force pilot."
16507,josh,I said they may have been talking about the pilot.
16508,josh,"There was a lot going on. There was the IMF treaty, the petroleum reserves, Alaska, the  President’s..."
16509,josh,I didn’t mention the pilot for any specific reason. I was saying there was a lot  happening three weeks ago.
16512,josh,What the hell’s going on?
16515,toby,They’re a brass quintet.
16517,toby," A brass quintet... two trumpets, trombone, baritone horn, French horn. Do you  like them?"
16518,josh,Do I like them for what?
16519,toby,To play Christmas carols here in the lobby in the morning and evenings as people are  coming and going.
16522,josh,Because this isn’t the Paramus mall.
16523,toby,"Let me tell you something, the last two Christmases in this White House I’ve been accused  of not being in the proper spirit. I was called names. Not this year! For the next three  weeks I will be filling this lobby with music in the mornings and evenings so that we may  all experience this season of...  Would you people  stop playing for one damn minute!"
16524,toby,This season of peace and joy.
16528,toby,And the loose change they collect goes to pay for musical instruments in DC public schools.
16529,josh,"Toby, Ben Zaharian stepped off the reservation last night."
16530,toby,What’d he do?  You guys can keep playing.
16531,josh,He was at a Q&A at the NRDC about drilling the North Slope. He was asked if the President  would consider tapping into the SPR and he said tapping into the SPR has a lot of merit.
16536,toby,Ben Zaharian did a Q&A last night and he was asked a question about the strategic  petroleum reserve.
16538,toby,He said tapping into the SPR has a lot of merit.
16540,toby,Would you please go in and give C.J. a heads up?
16541,c.j.,...And expressed his confidence when the IMF and the World Bank meet in Prague next week  some of those restrictions will be relaxed.
16542,c.j.,Well congress isn’t in session but you mean...
16543,c.j.,He sits on the foreign ep sub committee so... Mark.
16545,c.j.,I don’t know Mark. There’s a painting of Dolly Madison in the grand foyer. You catch it  in the wrong light it can scare the...
16547,c.j.,"No, it doesn’t, but I will say that a bad idea in June isn’t necessarily a bad idea in  December."
16548,c.j.,You don’t need to lower the price of heating oil during the summer. Thank you everyone.
16550,c.j.,Is somebody going to speak to somebody?
16556,c.j.,We get about five of those a week.
16560,c.j.,The blue blazers? You’re going to talk to someone at the energy department.
16563,c.j.,Thank you. Where’s the President?
16566,josh,Something about a pilot.
16567,bartlet,What’s going on? Sit down.
16569,bartlet,Is he in there alone? Is there a crew?
16572,bartlet,Is there any chance he’s trying to contact the ground and can’t?
16574,bartlet,Is his intention to defect with a military asset or his intention to blow something up?
16575,bartlet,Don’t our fighter pilors have to go through some kind of psychological testing?
16576,bartlet,Let me ask a ridiculous question and I know the answer is no. Is there any way to bring  this plane down without shooting it down?
16577,bartlet,What about populated areas?
16580,josh,No I wasn’t in the situation room. I don’t sit in on those meetings.
16581,josh,Yeah they’d tell me a little later because I had an assignment.
16583,josh,I’m sorry if this question sounds rude but how long will we be here today?
16584,josh,I know who asked you here.
16585,josh,For the fourth time there was a lot going on that day and I’m not sure why we have to be  fixated on...
16586,josh,I was supposed to look into his personal records to figure out why he...
16587,josh,When did you find out? 
16589,josh,How long has he been up there? 
16591,josh,How long before I see this on television? 
16593,josh,And how long before we make visual contact? 
16595,josh,What do we know about the pilot? 
16597,josh,Want me to get into it? 
16604,josh,How did you know I was going to ask you for that? 
16608,josh,"Yeah, but to be walking by with the guy's personnel file? "
16624,josh,To the Congressional Christmas party? 
16632,josh,He's got the same birthday as me. I'll be in here. 
16638,josh,They're not going to get us to change our policy on the SPR by announcing that we should  change our policy. 
16642,josh,I kind of have to do this thing right now. Can we talk about it later? 
16644,josh," You know this guy, the pilot? "
16646,josh,We have the same birthday. 
16649,c.j.,"Yeah, I asked him to come see me. "
16650,c.j.,"How you doing, Bernard? "
16651,c.j.,"That's not unusual, is it? "
16652,c.j.,I understand there was an incident on a tour. 
16653,c.j.,"Well, you should punish them for that, Bernard. "
16654,c.j.,This had to do with a painting. 
16655,c.j.,"Yeah, but it made it to the Press Room, so I just wanted to check in. "
16657,c.j.,"Well, okay. Thanks for stopping by. "
16659,c.j.,"Listen, who is Gustave Callioux, and how long has this painting been hanging outside the  Blue Room? "
16662,bartlet,They're going to know when the F-16's have painted him before I will. 
16664,bartlet,When I was in tenth grade me and my friends took my dad's Ford Country Squire for a  joyride to Vermont. He locked me in the garage till Easter. 
16665,bartlet,What do you think we should do with this pilot once we get his ass on the ground? 
16668,bartlet,I'm gonna sign them all by hand. 
16669,bartlet,I'm gonna sign them all by hand. 
16670,bartlet,I don't like the whole idea of the autopen. 
16671,bartlet,Let's do them all by hand. How many can there be? 
16672,bartlet,How many am I sending out? 
16674,bartlet,I'm sending out 1.1 million Christmas cards?  
16675,bartlet,Who are the other million? 
16677,bartlet,"Okay, but some of those were death threats. "
16678,bartlet,"Well, I'm not signing 1.1 million cards. "
16685,josh,"Robert Cano, yeah. Leo came and told me. "
16687,josh,I didn't learn anything.
16688,josh,There wasn't time. There was maybe twenty minutes between when I got the assignment and  when Leo came in. 
16690,josh,"He crashed into a mountain, Stanley. "
16691,josh,This was on the front page of the newspapers. 
16695,josh,Was the pilot alive when it crashed? 
16697,josh,"We know that for sure, or we're just...?"
16707,josh,The same things you know. He's from Tallahassee. He trained at Laughlin on T-37's. 
16709,josh,"I didn't know anything. I knew his, I knew his name, I knew his rank, uh, I knew where  he trained. I knew his missions. "
16710,josh,We had the same birthday. 
16711,josh,He's got some medals. One of them's a... Purple Heart. 
16713,josh,"His plane was shot at over Bosnia. It caught fire, he ejected. "
16718,josh,You put bagpipes in the lobby? 
16719,toby,"Not just any bagpipes, Josh. Those guys are the Duncan McTavish Clarney Highland Bagpipe  Regiment. "
16720,josh,They're a bagpipe regiment. 
16721,toby,"They're three guys from Delaware, but they can play. "
16722,josh,"Two weeks ago, it was a brass quintet; yesterday, it was the Capital Blue Plate Banjo Band. "
16723,toby,Capitol Bluegrass Banjo Brigade and those guys were featured on the local news. 
16727,toby,That's because the shepherds would need to call in the goats from high atop the hills... 
16728,josh,"Shepherds herd sheep, they don't do it in Delaware and these guys can't play in the lobby! "
16729,toby,They money that people toss in their cases will go to buy band uniforms for the  St. Mary's Assumption Marching Red Raiders. 
16730,josh,"Toby, I'm not kidding. "
16731,toby,These guys have a fourteen-song repertoire... 
16735,josh,They can't play in the lobby! 
16738,c.j.,"Hang on a second. Carol, a few days ago I met with Bernard Thatch of the White House  Visitors Office. "
16739,c.j.,He said the Secret Service took a report from a woman who had some kind of an episode  on a tour? 
16740,c.j.,"Uh, hang on. I should really glance at that report, could you get it for me? "
16741,c.j.,"Toby, if I get asked the SPR question... "
16742,josh,Would it be possible to hold the noise down out here?! 
16744,josh,I... need the CBO spec. 
16745,josh,It's like a damn hockey game out here. 
16746,josh,I don't... I'm not really comfortable with that question. 
16747,josh,I understand what you meant. 
16749,josh,This is incredibly prosecutorial! 
16750,josh,"I think if you want to know what my friends were thinking and why they were thinking it,  you should talk to my friends. "
16752,josh,The 19th of this month? 
16753,josh,"Stanley, to say ‘what was going on on the 19th...' the number of things that go on here  during a day... "
16758,c.j.,Something's strange about this photograph. 
16759,josh,"Listen, why is there no more information coming about Robert Cano? "
16760,c.j.,‘Cause there's no new information. 
16765,josh,A perfectly healthy air force pilot kills himself and nobody's asking why? 
16766,c.j.,"A lot of people are asking why, we just don't know why except that he obviously wasn't  perfectly healthy anymore! "
16768,c.j.,Hang on.  Look at this picture. Does something in  this picture look familiar? 
16769,josh,It's a man holding a little girl. 
16770,c.j.,Look behind the man on the wall. 
16775,josh,It's the same one that's hanging outside the Blue Room. 
16778,c.j.,I'm going to the Blue Room. 
16780,josh,She wouldn't shut up about Yo-Yo Ma. 
16781,josh,I like the cello fine. You asked me what was going on that day and one of the things that  was going on was that Donna wouldn't shut up about Yo-Yo Ma. 
16785,josh,It's not unusual for me to meet with the President in the Oval Office five or ten times  a day. 
16787,josh,"Nobody was next. I... I... I don't know what you heard about this meeting, but...  It wasn't even my meeting! "
16788,bartlet,OPEC will find a way to punish us. 
16790,bartlet,"If the Saudis are that concerned, why don't they just make the old faster? "
16793,josh,It was Sam's meeting. He wanted the President to get together with his Energy and  Economic advisors on the SPR. I was only there for a political perspective. 
16794,josh,There are only two things that ever stopped the government from doing anything money or  politics. 
16798,josh,I told him to...  You're not gonna understand it. 
16799,josh,You need to understand the background. 
16802,josh,You don't raise your voice to the President. 
16803,josh,You certainly don't do it in the Oval Office. 
16804,josh,"There's always lively discussion and the President's informal with his staff, but there's  a line you don't cross... Ever. You don't ever cross that line. "
16805,bartlet,Let's set up a meeting. 
16807,bartlet,You sold me. We're setting up a meeting.  
16809,josh,Can I say I think it's a bad idea? 
16811,josh,It's not something Didion's gonna like. 
16812,bartlet,"Well, I'm just talking about a meeting, but if I decide to do it, the President controls  the SPR and not Congress. "
16813,josh,"Yeah, but Didion controls the IMF vote. "
16814,bartlet,The two aren't related. 
16819,bartlet,I'm saying the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and forgiving the IMF debt are not related. 
16821,josh, Of course they're related. 
16823,josh,"If Didion doesn't like that we're tapping into the SPR, he won't let the IMF debt out  of committee. "
16824,bartlet,We'll talk to him tonight. 
16826,bartlet,"At the Christmas party, we'll take him aside... "
16827,josh," No, sir, you can't just take him aside... "
16829,josh, We can't move on from it! 
16831,josh,"We can't just take him aside! If we tell him we need his help then we give him visibility  and power, and we put him in a position to say ‘no' and be a hero to his party! Who  wouldn't want to do that for a living? "
16832,bartlet,"Josh, Didion's a good guy, we can talk to him. "
16833,josh,"You need to listen to me. You have to listen to me. I can't help you, unless you listen  to me! You can't send Christmas cards to everyone, you can't do it!  Forget the  SPR, let's get the IMF loans like we said we were going to, listen to what I have to say  about Didion, and please, listen to me! "
16835,josh,"All right, let's move on. "
16837,josh,"I suppose if it's just a meeting, we... "
16840,bartlet,We'll talk with Didion tonight? 
16842,bartlet,"By the way, it's not intervention in a free market if that's what he's worried about. "
16844,bartlet,It's not free trade if the price of oil is being controlled by a cartel. 
16846,bartlet,"Sam, you'll be in on this? "
16853,josh,I think I should go back in there. 
16861,josh,"If this is because of what I just said in there, I wasn't at my best with... "
16864,josh,I'm not sure it was as bad as maybe it was... 
16865,josh,"Stanley, you can ask the questions and you can answer them, but you can't do both at  the same time. "
16867,josh,Is there gonna be a... 
16869,josh,"Stanley, I got home from the thing, I made a drink, I sat down, I pushed the magazine  aside to use as a coaster, and I missed the coaster. "
16870,josh,I work out when I can. 
16871,josh,And I was so hoping we'd have a second day. 
16872,josh,You diagnosed me in eight hours? 
16873,josh,Yeah. The Congressional Christmas party. 
16874,josh,"The Congressional Christmas party was white-tie, which is unusual, but the President  likes it... "
16875,bartlet,"You look good, Charlie. "
16877,bartlet,Like Woodrow Wilson and top hats. 
16879,bartlet,"Charlie, this is how Statesmen dress. This is how they dress in times of occasion. "
16881,c.j.,Hello. I'm sorry to keep you waiting. 
16882,c.j.,"I'm C.J. Cregg, David. We spoke on the phone. "
16883,c.j.,"Mrs. Haussmann, I'm C.J. Cregg. I'm the White House Press Secretary.   Does she understand me? "
16884,c.j.,This is your painting. Your father was Augie Haussmann? 
16885,c.j.,And the Vichy Laws stripped him of his property? 
16886,c.j.,"Well, best as we can tell, the Nazis sold the painting to a Swiss dealer sometime after  your grandfather perished at Auschwitz. It made its way to the Musee d'Orsee, and then to  the National Gallery, where the President spotted it. We've contacted the French... "
16887,c.j.,...who wanted to settle this matter amicably. 
16888,c.j.,"We'd like you to have our sincere apology, as well as, of course, the painting back. "
16889,c.j.,Officers McDaniel and Smith from the Park Police are gonna escort you home. 
16890,c.j.,"You see, you try very hard to be mean, but then you see that being nice is better. "
16891,c.j.,So that moment's over? 
16892,c.j.,"Oh, Josh! Sam said the Didion meeting went well. "
16893,josh,"Yeah, we'll support a LIEHEAP subsidy for air-conditioning in the Texas 23rd. "
16896,c.j.,We're starting in five minutes. 
16898,josh,What was the diagnosis? 
16899,josh,You said you diagnosed me in five minutes. What was the diagnosis? 
16900,josh,"Well, that doesn't really sound like something they let you have if you work for the  President. Can we have it be something else? Seriously, I-I think you might be wrong  about that. I-I'm not tryin' to be difficult. "
16901,josh,"I know that I-I'm givin' you cocky answers, I that should be... "
16902,josh,I know that you want me to talk about my feelings. 
16903,josh,I'm not tryin' to give cocky answers... 
16905,josh,It was the Bach G Major. 
16908,josh,"He's really-he's really quite something, "
16910,josh,I was just sitting there. 
16912,josh,I don't know how it started! 
16913,josh,I couldn't make it stop. 
16914,josh,I couldn't make it stop. 
16916,josh,I sat down on the couch... 
16917,josh, I-I pushed the magazine aside as a coaster... 
16920,josh,We had nothing in common! 
16921,josh,Who gives a damn if we had the same birthday? 
16923,josh," Stanley! I made myself a drink, I pushed aside a magazine to use as a coaster. "
16929,josh,And... that'll do the trick? 
16930,josh,I-I'm gettin' short-changed here. 
16931,josh,Hang on! What happens if tomorrow some pilot with my birthday decides to kill himself? 
16935,josh,Why would the music have started it? 
16937,josh,So that's gonna be my reaction every time I hear music? 
16939,josh,"All the same, I need some more therapy! "
16942,josh,"Stanley, I haven't told you my dreams yet! "
16945,josh, Did you wait around for me? 
16946,josh,He thinks I may have an eating disorder. 
16948,josh,"And a fear of rectangles. That's not weird, is it?  I didn't cut my hand on a  glass. I broke a window in my apartment. "
16956,josh,I don't need the emergency room. 
16964,josh,I don't need a doctor. 
16972,josh,"We’re making a fire in a fireplace, what kind of supervision do you want?"
16979,josh,It’s like Ice Station Zebra.
16981,josh,It’s half past midnight!
16989,josh,It was sitting in... the thing. 
16991,josh,"It’s wood, we’re not burning Benjamin Harrison’s log cabin."
16999,josh,Is she doing the seating chart?
17001,josh,"Jancowitz has a hearing aid that seldom works, he needs to be seated near the center.  Would you tell her that?"
17003,josh,"No... no flammable liquids of any kind to start a fire, ever."
17009,c.j.,"Speaker , House Minority, Senate Majority,  Senate Minority, Whip, Whip, Deputy, Deputy."
17014,c.j.,What about staff aides?
17022,c.j.,He can’t sit closer to the center!
17024,c.j.,"Who cares?  It’s a breakfast to trumpet a new spirit of bi-partisanship cooperation  and understanding in a new year, no ones going to be listening to each other anyways!"
17026,c.j.,Because of the thing...
17028,c.j.,"All right, we’re gonna have to move somebody. Would you ask him if it’s better to dis  the House Whip or the Senate Whip?"
17030,josh,You want to stand them in a tripod right?
17034,josh,You just thought you’d say more words.
17037,josh,Hang on.  You know what we need?
17045,josh,Could you possible get us some dried leaves?
17048,josh,You think she was being sarcastic?
17050,josh,You know what we could use?
17052,josh,"See, this is what I’m talking about, this is teamwork!"
17057,c.j.,"So, we’ll move the House Whip to the left of Sam and move Jancowitz across from Leo and  we’re all set right?"
17058,c.j.,"Larry, Ed we’re set?  Either one of you?"
17059,c.j.,"Thank you, you see, you guys thought it was going to take a long time and it only ended  up taking 7 and a half hours."
17060,toby, Somebody working on the heat?
17061,c.j.,Seating arrangement is set.
17064,toby,You got to find a magic marker.
17065,c.j.,"Toby, when people are sitting with the President, there’s excruciating protocol involved."
17073,c.j.,"Okay, guys. You know what we did? We forgot the President."
17077,josh,"Well, the fire ought to dry it pretty quick shouldn’t it?"
17080,josh,It’s going pretty good now.
17082,toby,What the hell is going on?
17084,c.j.,Are you burning a dining room table?!
17085,josh,Spruce is a slow drying wood.
17086,toby,Do you have any idea whet you’re talking about?
17089,c.j.,Are those instructions?
17093,josh,Well that’s probably it then.
17094,josh,"Somebody started a fire in this fireplace, Charlie."
17096,josh,"Well, let’s get a fire extinguisher and put it out before the smoke alar..."
17100,toby,The meeting will last 90 minutes.
17104,toby,We can't talk about the Patient's Bill of Rights?
17110,toby,So with regard to the Patient's Bill of Rights we'll just be debating the things we  agree on?
17112,toby,And raising the minimum wage?
17114,toby,"No, we shouldn't because there's a chance it could lead to something."
17116,toby,We can talk about it. We just can't talk about dropping the no litigation clause.
17123,josh,I see won't be talking about the 993 tax cut.
17125,josh,We're calling it tax relief.
17127,josh,But we won't be talking about it.
17129,josh,"Leo, the Patient's Bill of Rights."
17133,josh,In exchange for calling tax breaks tax relief.
17137,toby,"Leo, I'm gonna check in with you for a second, OK?"
17141,toby,Not getting proper medical care...
17143,toby,Because they can't afford it...
17145,toby,Probably don't care that we've agreed to change the name of the bill.
17149,bartlet,Who was the idiot who set off the smoke detector?
17150,josh,"Well it sounds a lot like you are talking about Sam, Mr. President."
17152,bartlet,They had me on the Truman balcony for 6 minutes in my underwear.
17154,bartlet,In January? No. Why do you ask?
17155,toby,Mr. President I'd like to talk about those rules in that memo you’re reading.
17157,bartlet,We're having Vermont maple syrup?
17158,toby,"Mr. President, if you read item 4 you'll see that time at this breakfast will be  spent discussing calling the Patient's Bill of Rights the Comprehensive Access and  Responsibility Act."
17159,bartlet,I don't give a damn if they call it the Monroe doctrine. What the hell are we doing  serving Vermont maple syrup?
17160,toby,"On the minimum wage, if we all turn our attention to item 5 of the Rules of Bipartisan  Breakfast."
17162,toby,"Margaret, what does it say at the top of the memo?"
17164,bartlet,New Hampshire syrup is what we serve in this White House.
17166,bartlet,It's a breakfast. We eat. We pose for pictures. You do a post-game conference. Everybody  gets the hell out of here and I don't have to be so Officer Crupky.
17181,josh,"Okay, but you just asked me four times in the last ten seconds."
17187,josh,Are Ben and Sally asking for me?
17189,josh,What's at Ben and Sally's?
17191,josh,And what stupid-ass Irish thing did you say to Karen Cahill that you now need me to apologize  at Ben and Sally 's like a little girl?
17192,josh,Let me tell you what was surprising about that moment just then. I said that only 12 hours  after you were very cool about my almost accidentally setting the building on fire.
17196,josh,You're the second most powerful man in the country...
17198,josh,What could you possibly have said...?
17200,josh,Why don't you tell her?
17202,josh,You don't think the shoe shopping's gonna take care of that?
17204,josh,"You don't need to wave a stick, Leo. I am totally there for you. "
17206,josh,Can I get Sam to do it?
17210,c.j., And I'll end the press conference.
17211,c.j.,You're gonna walk him into the cause of bipartisanship?
17213,c.j.,The meeting was positive.
17214,c.j.,"Friendly, frank, and productive"
17215,c.j.,"Meeting was positive, friendly, frank and productive."
17216,c.j.,If all goes well we should...
17218,c.j.,And the Majority Leader'll be doing it in front of the actual White House. 
17219,c.j.,"Traditionally, these kinds of things are done in front of the White House."
17220,c.j.,The President's not gonna want to end a bipartisan breakfast with the Republicans speaking  from one place and the Democrats...
17223,c.j.,I don't think they are either.
17224,c.j.,"And, the Majority Leader is gonna brief outside. If the majority leader wants to skip  breakfast there'll be more pancakes for the rest of us. My press room can write about why."
17226,toby, Can I borrow her for a moment?
17229,toby,I could care less who says what in what order. I'm talking about what we say when we sit down.
17231,toby,The president prefers maple syrup from New Hampshire.  I'm not kidding.
17274,toby,I'm gonna have breakfast with Ann Stark tomorrow.
17276,toby,I think we should be able to discuss the minimum wage and-
17280,toby,I know. It's breakfast. We're not gonna come up with solutions in 90 minutes. But we have  the principles in a room and no cameras. The- This is what  my ex-wife and I did for years. We had these rules. We could talk about anything but why we  couldn't live with each other. I could've been two years younger right now.
17282,toby,This climate is exactly what real bipartisan debate should look like.
17296,toby,You don’t think it’d be a colossal waste of time?
17297,toby,It’s a bottle of New Hampshire maple syrup.
17303,toby,"You are now the Chief of Staff to the most powerful Republican in the country. Obviously,  a great deal of confidence has been placed into you..."
17305,toby, Uh... I don’t have one.
17306,toby,"Scrambled eggs, wheat toast and coffee, please."
17307,c.j.,"Carol, did the President say that the stats were even more staggering right here,  in Washington, D.C.?"
17308,c.j.,Would you remind me to clarify that?
17309,c.j.,"He was in Louisville, Kentucky, when he said it."
17313,c.j.,About moving the Press Room to the OEOB...
17317,c.j.,Don’t let anyone ever know that you wrote it and don’t ever mention it again under any  circumstances!
17326,c.j.,"We’re not getting a swimming pool, Sam."
17328,c.j.," By ‘state-of-the-art,’ you mean..."
17330,c.j.,"The press doesn’t want physical distance from the President, and the American people would  prefer it the President didn’t have physical distance from the press!"
17331,c.j.,We can’t exile the press!
17333,c.j.,It sends a signal we’re trying to hide things from them.
17337,c.j., I don’t need more information.
17339,c.j.,I don’t need to ruminate!
17348,josh,"Yeah. Donna, get me the polling center at Global Strategies Group!"
17353,josh,  What should the question be?
17355,josh,"Okay.  ""Would you object to the White House moving the Press Room out of the  West Wing and into a facility across the street?"" Read it back."
17362,josh,The nuclear weapons are in Kazakhstan.
17372,toby,And why not talk about the minimum wage?
17373,toby,"Ann, do you know what a full-time worker, employed at five dollars and fifteen cents an hour,  makes in a year?"
17374,toby,Which is 26 hundred dollars below the poverty line. Why have a minimum wage?
17376,toby,"I’m saying it could at least keep up with inflation! In the last thirty years, the purchasing  power of the minimum wage has gone down 30%, while you know how much the stock market has  gone up?"
17377,toby,"Fine, so let’s talk about it at breakfast!"
17379,toby,"No, they will call and say, ‘What the hell are you doing, rolling the ball at all?’ You’re  gonna sandbag the thing in committee. You’ve shown us your whole hand. You’re playing a game  and not that well."
17380,toby,Your predecessor didn’t play it well.
17381,toby,"Ann, we’re not going to get screwed around on the wage hike."
17382,toby,We have the votes and you know it.
17383,toby,"There is going to be a vote, straight up or down, and if there isn’t, we’ll offer the wage  hike as an amendment on everything that moves!"
17384,toby,You heard me the first time.
17389,toby,In. Exchange. For what?
17391,toby,You want the press conference at the Hill?
17396,bartlet,Who’s the next meeting?
17397,bartlet,"I don’t need a cheat sheet.  Kim Woo, he won a bronze medial for  fencing, he’s a Buddhist, and he enjoys European History. You see Charles’s even thought  it’s a handshake, I’m able to make him feel like a friend and that’s a little thing they  call ‘people skills.’"
17398,bartlet,"The man’s an Olympic athlete, Charlie. I wouldn’t say that to his face."
17400,bartlet,"on glasses, reads] Ladies and Gentleman.  She’s a woman?"
17401,bartlet,Did you mark that down? 
17402,bartlet, Did you know it’s bad luck to toast with water?
17403,bartlet,"Yeah, you don’t want to make a toast with water."
17404,bartlet,"From Greek mythology, I’m almost sure. You lose your spirit. "
17406,bartlet,"That’s a great question, Charlie, and I could tell you, but I think it’s better if you look  it up on your own."
17407,bartlet, Remind me to tell Sam that’s good.
17408,bartlet,And remind me not to make a toast with water.
17454,toby,Yeah. I just had breakfast with Ann Stark. 
17459,c.j.,Cause they'll be a fight. 
17462,toby,There should be a fight. We disagree on something important and immediate. 
17463,c.j.,Which means there should be a compromise.
17464,toby,Which isn't going to happen by posing for a picture. 
17465,c.j.,"It isn't gonna happen eating pancakes either, Toby, so let 'em tell dirty jokes for  90 minutes, shake hands, and start the year. "
17466,toby,Not when it's the taxpayers’ pancakes. 
17467,c.j.,The taxpayers will be happy to know that the Democrats are trying to tighten heir belts  where they can. 
17468,toby,They're willing to put a provision of the patients’ bill up for discussion. 
17469,c.j.,"Well, that's a little something you can all disagree on. "
17471,c.j.,You can do a lot of disagreeing in fifteen minutes. 
17472,toby,In exchange she wants the press conference on the hill. 
17473,c.j.,Now she wants the whole thing on the hill?! 
17475,c.j.,I said ‘no’ yesterday to the split conference what makes her think...
17476,toby,Because I'm asking you to. 
17478,toby,That's what they get in exchange. 
17481,c.j.,"Toby, are you kidding me?! "
17483,c.j.,"First of all, I don't even know where to start..."
17484,c.j.,"But first of all, if they say anything that needs a response I need twenty minutes with  staff. I can't stand around there and huddle in front of the White House and Congressional  Press Corps. "
17485,toby,"There's not gonna be a surprise, you've already decided what you're gonna say, which is not  much of anything at all! "
17486,c.j.," We don't speak for the President on the steps of the capital,  we don't need to be offered their microphone it makes us look like less than what we are,  in fact, it makes us look small!"
17487,toby,"We're calling tax breaks tax reliefs, refusing to discuss raising the salary of those living  in poverty, arguing the seating arrangement and you think that's going to make us look small? "
17489,toby,We're talking about the no litigation clause for fifteen minutes. I don't care if the damn  press conference is outside the rotary club. 
17490,c.j.,It shouldn't be me then. 
17492,c.j.,It should be the deputy. 
17493,toby,I'll tell Ann it's not going to be you. 
17494,c.j.,"I think this is a bad idea. I think the first visual we get is that Congress is the seat of  power and the President is irrelevant. Not only that, but you just took my legs out from  under me with Ann! Are you ordering me to move it to the hill? "
17495,toby,I don't like doing that. 
17499,c.j.,"Hey Steve, you should be up on the hill. "
17504,c.j.,She got called by a pollster. 
17505,c.j.,She herself got called. 
17507,c.j.,When did he get a sore throat? 
17508,c.j.,She took the Majority Leader off the board. 
17509,c.j.,She took him off the board. 
17510,c.j.,"Was it a balance thing? No, she didn't want balance she wanted power. "
17511,c.j.,Why would she take her boss off the board? 
17512,c.j.,We're about to get hit.
17514,c.j.,No kidding.  Get me Henry. 
17515,c.j.,I've got Henry. What do you want? 
17516,c.j.,"What do you want me to do, Toby?"
17517,toby, Don't let him take the podium. You'll take questions in the briefing room in  20 minutes.
17520,toby,That was me.  I gave Ann Stark the quote and she fed it to a reporter.
17522,toby,It wasn’t a quote when I gave it to her.
17524,toby,I was letting her know we have the votes...
17528,toby, I misunderstood my relationship with Ann Stark.
17535,c.j.,I have press in ten minutes...
17537,josh,We can take the high road and say we don’t want it to disintegrate into a war of words.
17539,c.j.,The fragile peace has been disrupted. We’ve been accused of ambushing the Majority Leader  in the press.
17540,josh,Also Labour’s going to want to know if we stand by the minimum wage.
17542,josh,"Yeah, let’s emphasize the close we are on this."
17544,c.j.,"Sounds like we’re close to agreeing on 30 months which we’re not, and no one’s going to  want to cover a statement from the Labour Secretary which is good, ‘cause if they did it’d  look like we’re ducking."
17546,toby,"She’s right. We can’t be passive and the high road doesn’t go where we need it to.  Be cool, be funny, smack them down hard."
17548,josh,And why wasn’t he at the podium? A sore throat? We know how tough that can be. Thank goodness  he had health insurance.
17551,josh,And that’s the new story.
17554,c.j.,"Carol, I need voting stats on health care. "
17555,josh,"How’s this for a phrase ""You can lay down in front of the train or you can get on board?"""
17557,josh,"Is it better if it’s ""You can get on board the train or you can lay down in front of it?"""
17576,josh,"I’m holding... your underwear... in my hand... right now. And the way I know it’s your  underwear is that your name sewn in the back, which is obviously something we’ll spend  some time talking about at a later date."
17582,josh,"Okay, when you get dressed on day two did you check the pant leg for the previous day’s  underwear?"
17586,josh,It would appear that way.
17588,josh,The South Street exhibit.
17590,josh,On the floor in front of Karen Cahill.
17593,c.j.," Fred and Ethel, would you follow me please?"
17594,josh,She’s talking about us.
17595,c.j.,Did a question get tacked on to the monthly DNC tracking poll about moving the press room?
17597,c.j.,"The public gets their news from the press, and the press gets their news..."
17599,c.j.,So they don’t know what questions we’re asking?
17606,josh,Wow. What are the chances of that?
17609,josh,We can calculate it. They sample 800 respondents...
17610,c.j.,Would the two of you stop being amazed by the mathematics!
17618,josh,You had a lot of opportunities today to say ‘I told you so’ and score some points with Leo.  You’re a class act.
17619,c.j.,Why were you holding women’s underwear before?
17620,josh,Never really needed a reason. Eat ‘em up.
17621,toby,"And shocked. Shocked, I say, to discover that there is gambling going on in this establishment."
17622,toby,You think this is funny?
17624,toby,My party’s in the White House.
17625,toby,You think I’m going to sit around while you reduce the President to Prime Minister?
17626,toby,You think this could wait until an election year?
17627,toby,"Because ten years ago we used to be able to sit down, we’d order a couple of bourbons,  we’d talk about health care, we’d talk about the minimum wage.  He didn’t  have a sore throat."
17628,toby,You kept him off the board so he could come back on and fix it.
17629,toby,When are you going to announce?
17630,toby,That he’s running for President.
17631,c.j.,Good morning. I’m going to read a short statement in response to the rather bizarre take  on what was otherwise an unremarkable...
17632,bartlet,I think the whole damn thing is bizarre.
17633,bartlet,The right moment for what?
17634,bartlet,"Well, I’m not sure there is a right moment for you to ask me that, Charlie."
17637,bartlet,Donna wants me to call Karen Cahill and make it clear she wasn’t hitting on her when she gave  her her underwear.
17639,bartlet,There can’t possibly be nuclear weapons in Kyrgyzstan.
17642,bartlet," I’m going to bed. If anybody thinks of new ways for us to make friends  don’t hesitate to wake me. Or, you know, just feel free to start a fire."
17645,toby,He didn’t want to see me.
17649,toby,It was a blunder from top to bottom. You should know it could have been avoided at several  points along the way if I’d listened to C.J.
17653,toby,They do. They should. We have honest disagreements. Arguments are good.
17655,toby,"What about persuasion? They’re coming for us, Leo."
17657,toby,I mean they’re coming for us now.
17663,toby,"So we’ve got to do it for him. We’ll keep it away from this office but we’ve got to get real  now. Leo, Ann Stark’s a war time consigliere. That’s why she was bumped up."
17680,bartlet,"Mr. Sumatra, I understand you're a sports fan. "
17681,bartlet,"Okay. Well, golf's not a sport. It's fine. Don't get me wrong but let's not you and  I confuse it with things that men do. "
17682,bartlet,"You know, we're going to Bangkok in June, I think.  June, Charlie? "
17683,bartlet,"Best hotel in the world, right?"
17685,bartlet, Make sure I see that. 
17687,bartlet,"Mr. Sumatra, I accept your letter of credence from King Adulyadej and by affixing my  signature and seal,  do hereby declare you to be an ambassador  extraordinary and plenipotentiary. "
17688,bartlet,May our people know peace and prosperity.  Congratulations. 
17689,bartlet,We've got some gifts here and we're going to stand for pictures. 
17690,bartlet," Madam, congratulations. "
17700,bartlet,And I'm sure somebody will come along soon thereafter and tell it didn't work. 
17702,bartlet,Cause it's not going to work. 
17706,bartlet,"Well, I can't make you Thailand's ambassador to the United States because I just signed  that guy's letter.  "
17708,bartlet,You know what you are? You are the Charlie Brown of missile defense. The Pentagon is Lucy. 
17710,bartlet,Peanuts. Charlie Brown. 
17714,bartlet,"Leo, were you born at the age of 55? "
17716,bartlet,"Charlie Brown wanted to kick a football and Lucy would hold it, except she'd pull it  away at the last minute and Charlie Brown would fall on his butt."
17718,bartlet,"No, but each time Lucy would find a way to convince Charlie Brown that this time she  wouldn't pull the ball away. But she would and, once again, Charlie Brown would fall  on his butt."
17722,bartlet,The DOD bringing you to the Situation Room every time they run a new missile test so  that you come tell me how great it works so I'll put money in the NMD system. 
17729,bartlet,And it's going to hit my garage in New Hampshire when?
17734,bartlet,"Okay, but we don't have anybody out there right now do we? "
17736,bartlet,"When we stay at the Oriental in Bangkok, we have to check out James Michener's typewriter."
17737,bartlet,Is that silence usually a pretty good sign? 
17739,bartlet,It was just enthusiastic. 
17744,bartlet,"When you consider the size of outer space, Leo, that's not so bad. "
17745,bartlet,"By the way, the words you're looking for are ""Oh good grief."" "
17746,c.j.,"For those of you who haven't seen it, it's a very lovely ceremony. It's relatively  informal, the ambassadors are led into the Oval Office, probably with a few friends  and family. They chat for a few moments with President, maybe exchange some gifts,  and they're officially presented by the State Department's Chief of Protocol, who  asks the President to accept the ambassador's credentials and the President signs  a letter to that effect.  Yes? "
17747,c.j.,"There is! It's the order in which they arrived in Washington. This morning the President  saw Ambassador Sumatra of Thailand, then will be Peter Hans of Sweden, followed by her  Excellency Renee Ernesto of Argentina, Noah Jolla of Burkina Faso and the newly named  British Ambassador to the United States will be arriving in the United States just as  soon as he's been newly named. "
17749,c.j.,"Anthony Brass cited family obligations at home, and withdrew over the weekend. "
17750,c.j.,"Sir Christopher Nealingroach, yes. Sir Christopher has been diagnosed with a rare form  of encephalitis, contracted during his recent posting to Kenya. "
17751,c.j.,"I don't know. As soon as the State Department tells me, I'll know. In the meantime, it's  pool photographs only until tomorrow night when there'll be a cocktail reception for the  new ambassadors. That's all.  Does anybody wanna know who's  been here the longest? The Dean of the Diplomatic Corps...anybody? Guys, you know I  study these things just for you! It's Prince Vandaar Ben Sultan of Saudi Arabia. "
17752,c.j.,I could have also told them that Burkina Faso has a population of eleven million and  in even years they host Africa's largest crops market. 
17753,c.j.,I need a chance to use that knowledge. 
17755,c.j.,You know the chief crops of Burkina Faso? 
17757,c.j.,"Millet, sorghum, rice, peanuts and cotton. "
17759,c.j.,I thought we passed on the GDC. 
17766,c.j.,The Clean Air Rehabilitation Effort. It's an effort by which we clean the air and  rehabilitate it. 
17768,c.j.,I'm not involved in the nuances of environmental policy! 
17772,c.j.,I knew the crops of Burkina Faso! 
17789,toby,It was fine.  What's goin' on? 
17793,toby,What are you talking about? 
17797,toby,When was this decision made? 
17799,toby,Why wasn't I involved? 
17803,toby,"I have a damn telephone, Sam! "
17805,toby,Who was at this meeting?
17807,toby,Where the decision was made.
17813,toby,"There are a number of problems, anyone of which I could have told you about, had you  gotten me on the phone! Well, one thing, we already blew off the AFL CIO, cause we told  them the President was gonna be in South America. "
17815,toby,"Instead, he's speaking for labor's good friend, the environmental lobby! "
17817,toby,"Also, he's the President of the United States, he's nobody's understudy! You've got  him goin' out there like... Joey Bishop! "
17819,toby,Of course he's enthusiastic. 
17821,toby,Alright... I don't... alright. 
17825,toby,Fine. I need to see Leo. 
17826,c.j.,It's not gonna be Sir Christopher Nealingroach. 
17828,c.j.,I said it's not gonna be Sir Christopher Nealingroach. 
17830,c.j.,But I like to say Sir Christopher Nealingroach. 
17832,c.j.,I'm waiting to hear from someone at the State Department. 
17834,c.j.,Maybe it'll be Sir Christopher Nealingroach. 
17835,josh,Can I stop talking to you now? 
17837,josh,I'm standing with my back straight against the wall. 
17839,josh,I was told by the doctors it would relax me. 
17848,josh,What's a reporter doing talking to you? 
17850,josh,Leo McGarry has nothing but respect and affection for John Marbury. 
17852,josh,"Good, 'cause Leo thinks he's a lunatic. "
17854,josh,"That may be so, but Leo thinks he's a lunatic. "
17858,josh,How do you know he's brilliant? 
17860,josh,"I'm not threatened by his brilliance, nor am I threatened by his good looks. "
17862,josh,I'm not threatened at all... 
17864,josh,"Neither Leo or I are threatened by his brains, his looks or his charm. He is, however,  a lunatic Brit and we're grateful there's an ocean between us. "
17868,josh,"Please, don't tell me... "
17871,josh,"I'm just gonna, you know, stand next to the wall for a while longer. "
17874,josh,"Okay, what I need people to do is knock. "
17876,josh,But you didn't wait for a response. 
17878,josh,"'Cause, I could have been relaxing by standing behind that door. "
17881,toby,It was fine. So we're pinch hitting at the GDC conference. 
17882,josh,"For the record, I didn't think it was a good idea and I said so. "
17883,toby,"And it seems to have helped. Look, we can't appear to be at the beckon call of the  environment! "
17884,josh,We could try insulting them. 
17891,toby,"Environmental terrorists burned down a ski resort, and the GDC didn't comment. "
17892,josh,Why did environmental terrorists burn down a ski resort? 
17896,josh,Environmental terrorists burned down a ski resort to save a golf course? 
17898,josh,Sam's going to have strong objections. 
17900,josh,"All right, you want me to talk to Leo? "
17901,toby,I'm going to talk to him. I want you to talk to C.J.. 
17903,toby,The Will Roger's dinner is going to ask Cornelius Sykes to host. 
17906,josh,He didn't laugh at the joke. 
17909,toby,Why do you relax by standing behind the door? 
17910,josh," I'm not standing behind the door, I'm standing with my back straight  against the wall, so that if... "
17920,toby, Sam just told me about his speech. 
17928,toby,I'm saying how'd it... 
17930,toby,"Leo, how could you not be in that meeting? "
17934,toby,Here's what I think... 
17936,toby," Did I say that? Did I say, 'screw the environmental lobby?' "
17938,toby,"That's right, and before I even open my mouth, you decide I'm going to say 'screw the  environmental lobby?' "
17940,toby,There's an extent to which we've gotta screw the environmental lobby. 
17942,toby,A clear and public demonstration that the President's not beholden to them isn't a bad  idea right now. 
17944,toby,"I really do, for 30 seconds out of a 40 minute address announcing the initiative  they love. "
17946,toby,"Not that good, but that's the point. We don't have to move to our right if there's an  opportunity to spank the people to our left. "
17948,toby,Failing to publicly admonish acts of eco-terrorism. 
17950,toby,"Yes, but they fail to publicly admonish those who do. "
17952,toby,A 12 million dollar Colorado ski development that was under construction was set on  fire because it threatened the habitat of a rare local lynx. 
17954,toby,"I don't know. I... I think... I think it's like a possum or something, and it doesn't  matter... "
17956,toby,I don't want it in the advanced text. I don't want Sam and his fourteen objections.  It should just be a drop-in. 
17965,c.j.,Through the Clean Air Rehabilitation Effort. 
17969,c.j.,Were you able to get girls to go out with you in High School? 
17975,c.j.,"No, but I can tell you that lumber, cocoa beans, aluminum and petroleum products are  the major exports of Cameroon. "
17978,josh,Can I have her for a second? 
17980,c.j., Why do you ask him and not me? 
17983,josh,Can we... please? C.J. and Josh walk outside and close the door. 
17984,c.j.,Did you hear they named John Marbury British Ambassador? 
17987,josh,"I know, it's got to be like Davy Jones himself is showing up. "
17988,c.j.,"Okay, don't make fun of Davy Jones, all right? He once wrote me a letter. He took that  kind of time. And he still tours! Plus, my love for John Marbury is real, it's not a  schoolgirl crush. He calls me  'Princepessa.' "
17991,josh,"Well, he calls Leo 'Gerald.' "
17995,josh,Janice Barry is saying they're going to ask Cornelius Sykes to host the Will Rogers'  dinner. 
17997,josh,They're going to ask him on Monday. 
17998,c.j.,They're going to stir this up again. 
18000,c.j.,He didn't laugh at the joke! How many more ways are there for me to say that? He didn't  laugh at the joke! 
18001,josh,You guys are friends. I was thinking... 
18004,c.j.,I don't hang out with Corey Sykes! 
18005,josh,"Yeah, but you know him! "
18007,josh,"He's in New York, doing standup. I thought since you were going to be there, you... "
18008,c.j.,I'll see him tomorrow night. 
18010,c.j.,He didn't laugh at the joke! 
18011,josh, You'll see him tomorrow night? 
18014,josh," Could you see that a meeting is arranged for tomorrow night in  New York with C.J., Cornelius Sykes, and no one else? "
18022,josh,"That's a good idea, I'm gonna do that. "
18025,bartlet,"I think a lot of people don't realize that Swedes have lived in Sweden more than 5,000  years longer than nearly any other European people. "
18026,bartlet,"In fact, Gothic tribes from Sweden played a major role in the disintegration of the  Roman Empire, did they not? "
18027,bartlet,So you've got that to answer for! 
18033,bartlet,"Sweden has a 100% literacy rate, Leo, a hundred percent! How do they do that? "
18045,bartlet,"That tenth one! See, if there were just nine... "
18048,bartlet,"Leo, seriously, when they were telling you that on the phone, how stupid did you think  you'd sound saying that to me? "
18052,bartlet,Do we need to decide this right now? 
18062,bartlet,And we can't take it for granted that everyone pretty much fundamentally opposes arson? 
18064,bartlet,It would be hypocrisy not to hold our friends to the same standard... 
18066,bartlet,Yet it feels strange to score political points by doing the right thing. 
18068,bartlet, I'm victim to my own purity of character.
18070,bartlet,"Okay, well, it's not a kind of a possum, so why don't you get me that information.  Toby doesn't want it in the speech? "
18080,bartlet," 2,000 environmentalists are going to try to kill me tomorrow night! "
18081,bartlet,They're going to come at me with vegan food and pitchforks! 
18082,bartlet,"Still, I'd like you to get between me and any boiled seaweed you see coming my way. "
18084,bartlet,Leo just talked to me. 
18085,toby,About the GDC tonight. 
18086,bartlet,"Yeah, I'm not doing this for the politics, I'm doing it because it's the right thing  to do. "
18087,toby,"Well, I'm doing it for the politics. "
18088,bartlet,A lynx isn't a possum. 
18089,toby,I think it's in the possum family. 
18091,toby,"Oh, and we don't have enough of those."
18092,bartlet,How did Sam feel about this?  Toby? 
18093,toby,"This isn't government camp, it's not like... it's not important that everybody gets to  play! "
18094,bartlet,"I'm not going to tell you how to run your office, Toby. "
18096,bartlet, Vegan food. Coming at me all night long. 
18099,c.j.,"New York, New York, Toby. The town so nice they named it twice. "
18100,toby,What are you doing there? 
18101,c.j.,I'm receiving the Matrix Award from New York women in communications. 
18103,c.j.,"I discovered a comet. What do you mean, 'for what?' "
18105,c.j.,"Past winners, by the way, include Cokie Roberts, Diane Sawyer and Ms. Leslie Stahl. "
18106,toby,Josh talked to you about... 
18107,c.j.,"Yeah, I'm meeting him for a drink after the thing. "
18108,toby,You briefed on the Clean Air Rehabilitation...? 
18110,toby,"Okay, you might need this:  "
18111,c.j.,He's gonna do a drop-in? 
18113,c.j.,I'll see you tomorrow night. 
18118,toby,"And what do we say when they say, ""But changes in the Clean Air Rehabilitation effort  seriously choke the auto, trucking and utility business""? "
18119,toby,Public health benefits? 
18123,toby,She had a lunch - media women... women of media? 
18125,toby,She had to stay around. 
18127,toby,Yeah. Call me from the place. 
18133,josh,You're not going to turn the President around on the missile shield. 
18143,josh,"Good to see you, ambassador. "
18149,josh,Leo's trying to convince the President to give the NMD more time. 
18156,c.j.,Thanks for taking the time. 
18158,c.j.,I gotta get the 7:00 shuttle. 
18160,c.j.,"Oh, I haven't seen the movie yet. "
18161,c.j.,That's what everyone's saying. 
18162,c.j.," So, you know, this is about the Will Rogers dinner. "
18163,c.j.,They're going to ask you to host and obviously the President's going to be there.   We appreciate the support. 
18164,c.j.,We think the press'll go back two years and bring up the whole...
18165,c.j.,"I don't want to. Uh, you know how I feel about you. You know I don't mean you disrespect. "
18171,bartlet, It's good to have you here. 
18172,bartlet,What made you agree to take the post? 
18174,bartlet,"Listen, I gotta go a few blocks across town to give an address on global warming and the  future of our planet. That's not something you're interested in, right? "
18175,bartlet,"Okay. Well, stay here and fight with Leo about something. We'll get you some dinner.  I'll be back in an hour. We'll do your thing and then enjoy your reception. "
18181,c.j.,It was not a benign joke. 
18182,c.j.,You don't tell benign jokes. 
18183,c.j.,It was a joke about New York City cops shooting black men.
18184,c.j.,It was a political fundraiser in the heat of a national campaign. You weren't doing a  2 a.m. set at Catch a Rising Star. 
18185,c.j.,"You made the joke, and inoffensive as you think it may have been, there was enormous  pressure on the candidate to disavow your remarks and he did not."
18187,c.j.,"We were courting law enforcement, Corey. Don't be naive. "
18188,c.j.,What did you expect us to do? 
18192,c.j.," You did. Okay, I gotta go. "
18193,toby,Is the President offstage yet?
18194,toby,Anyone know how it's going?
18206,toby,"Sam, are you listening? "
18208,toby,"Here's what you say, ""Friends are honest with each other. The President has always  spoken out on moderate groups not taking responsibility for terrorism and he isn't  going to stop with the environmental lobby."" "
18212,toby," Sam, what's happening? "
18222,c.j.,"Yeah. Here's what it is: the President has always spoken out on moderate groups not  taking responsibility for extremism, and he isn't going to stop at the environmental  lobby. Friends are honest with each other.  Sam? "
18228,c.j.,They're setting up for the reception? 
18230,toby,Sixty billion dollars can be spent on other things.
18232,toby,"I'm talking about Abrams' tax and Apache helicopters, which we know work."
18234,toby,"Well so far neither can anything else.  Hey, Sam? "
18236,toby,Have you been getting questions? 
18238,toby,Have you been getting questions? 
18264,toby,"No, no, Alice. I got it."
18268,toby,You don't ever go into the Oval Office mad.
18270,toby,"No, no, no. No, Sam. You don't ever go in there mad."
18274,toby,The energy package doesn't need to be a story; it's going to be a law.
18276,toby,"I think we need them, I just don't think we're going to lose them."
18280,toby,"Well then they can grow up, Sam. Use this insult? They just got the energy package they  wanted, they just got the president at their dinner, and they should shut up!"
18282,toby,"When they look down the ballot and see the alternatives, they get receptive in a hurry."
18284,toby, You can sit here. I'll see you tomorrow.
18286,toby,"Sam, I'm looking at opposition polling that scares the hell out of me. I'm looking at  internal numbers that change by the hour. I'm listening to economists that tell me  there's weather..."
18292,toby,I don't want that discussion. 
18294,toby,We can't govern if we don't win. 
18296,toby,Anyway. I have this beer...
18298,toby,I was just gonna sit down and drink it.
18300,toby,"I mean, we don't have to talk or anything."
18302,bartlet,"That was Chairwoman Shelly Lubis I just got off the phone with. Before that was a  conference call with Jamie Schwartz of the Environmental Defense Fund, Bryce Davis  of the Sierra Club, and three Democratic Congressman from the Subcommittee on Energy  and the Environment. The number of different words they had for ""manipulative,""  Leo, there's no way they didn't have a thesaurus open in front of them. Bryce Davis  said if I keep this up, he's going to encourage Seth Gillette in a thirdparty bid."
18304,bartlet,"I said for fifty bucks and a ride to the airport, Gillette could have the job right now."
18306,bartlet,I politely reminded him that it's probably not a good idea to threaten the president.   I want to know when you're pushing me towards the missile  shield it's not because you want me to look strong on defense.
18307,bartlet,Would you tell Charlie I'm ready?
18311,josh,"You know, can I say this? Why don't we just give the sixty billion dollars to North Korea  in exchange for not bombing us?"
18312,bartlet,It's almost hard to believe that you're not on the National Security Council.
18313,josh,I know. I feel like they're missing an important voice.
18314,bartlet,"John! Let me explain why you've been waiting. I have to see people in the order they  arrive, and you got beat by Argentina."
18315,bartlet,You also lost out on preferred seating for the State of the Union. 
18318,bartlet,Where are you on the missile shield?
18321,bartlet,"Well, it's a discussion for serious men. They say a statesman is a politician who's  been dead for fifteen years. I'd like us to be statesmen while we're still alive.  Lord Marbury, I accept your letter of credence from Queen Elizabeth, and, by affixing  my signature and seal, do hereby declare you to be Ambassador Extraordinary and  Plenipotentiary."
18329,toby,Delete 'vigorously' from the first sentence.
18332,toby,"No, we’re just gonna pursue it regularly."
18333,toby,Not tonight.  Change chokehold to tight grip.
18334,toby,"No, Sam’s still on it. "
18337,bartlet,Bob Novak just said this was the speech of my political life. You know how many times  I’ve heard that?
18338,toby,"Sir, Senator McGowan say’s we’re fine if we cut 'vigorously.'"
18342,bartlet,Abbey’s already in her seat?
18343,bartlet," I said, my wife’s in her seat?"
18356,toby,Tell C.J. the green light on the Blue Ribbon. She’ll know what it means.
18364,josh,Excuse me... What are you doing?
18365,josh,You were putting gum in your mouth?
18366,josh,'Cause that’s a good idea to be chewing gum when you’re taking a poll for the President  of the United States. That’s the sound people like to hear over the phone.
18367,josh,"Well, thank you... Mr. Helper."
18371,josh,They’re not our people.
18373,josh,None of them have accents?
18375,josh,I’m saying Joey Lucas is deaf. She would have NO way of knowing...
18377,josh, Do any of you people have accents? 
18379,josh,Do any of you people have the power of speech?
18381,josh,I should be there right now.
18386,c.j.,Excuse me. I’ve got a heads up! There’ll be a last minute addition.
18387,c.j.,The President will be announcing a bipartisan Blue Ribbon Commission to study the  long-term future Entitlement Programs. Obviously there will be more details in the  address.
18388,c.j.,You know when I say 'last minute' I’m wrong. We’re just under three minutes.
18389,c.j.,It’s something he’s been going back and forth on. He wanted to make sure he had the  support of the Democratic leadership.
18390,c.j.,"Yes. I also wanted to remind you that ""Capital Beat"" will be broadcasting live from the  West Wing for the two or three hours following the address so that area is gonna be off  limits for carousing."
18392,c.j.,Because they’re special. Enjoy the show everybody. 
18393,toby,...blunders and abandoning our ideological... what?
18395,toby,Those of us in the future will demand boldly putting aside our partisan blinders and  abandoning our ideological... entrenchment.
18401,toby, Phone it to the Prompter.
18405,bartlet,"Mr. Finney, would you tell the Speaker I’d like to see him please?"
18408,josh,"Up there is where this President eats! That is his place of business. Yes, he did well."
18410,josh,Let’s find out how well.
18418,josh,Didn’t you talk to Joey?
18422,josh, What did she say I should tell the callers?
18426,josh,They’re not supposed to receive special instructions based on...
18428,josh,Time zones!? I don’t know. I’m... I’m not a pollster. I thought Joey called.
18430,josh,When is she gonna be here?
18431,josh,"Kenny, really, that better had been her talking."
18432,josh,Where the hell you been?
18433,josh,This is the State of the Union. There was nothing you could do about it?
18434,josh,Is this the kind of Noel Cowardesque wit I can expect all night long?
18435,josh,I want to start the phone banks. They need instructions.
18436,josh,I had already taken care of the gum thing...
18437,c.j.," 14. You know, Mark, the President is a commanding public speaker  and the bar is usually set quite a bit higher when it’s a major address but tonight he  cleared it with room to spare."
18438,c.j.,I have 72 times but I’ll take your count.
18446,c.j.,I’m not wearing any pants. Can we do it here?
18453,c.j., You know why I’m not wearing any pants?
18456,c.j.,After the speech I went to the sculpture garden to get some air and take it in and I  sat on a bench.
18458,c.j.,"It did it turns out, but..."
18461,c.j.,In the women’s locker room.
18465,c.j.,"Yeah, and it’s the bathrobe’s that’s outrageous. "
18474,c.j.,"Okay, so they gave him an official condemnation. "
18476,c.j.,Does anybody have the story yet?
18479,c.j.,I need to see the Police Officer. What was his name?
18516,josh, Jack Sloane was reprimanded for excessive force by the Detroit Police  Department.
18520,josh,I don’t know. He made a bust. He broke the guys leg. The DA couldn’t make a case.  The civil suit was dismissed but it’s there.
18523,josh,Officer Jack Sloane of the Detroit Police Department was added at the last minute to  the invited guests that are recognized by the President during the speech.
18526,josh, It was last minute. When do I see numbers?
18528,josh,Great! When do I see numbers?
18529,josh,Fantastic. When do I see numbers?
18531,josh,You get early numbers....
18532,josh,"So, what do you do in the meantime?"
18534,josh,"I’m plagued by this nonsense, Donna. I swear, it’s just reaching epidemic proportions.  Those numbers are gonna tell us we had a big night and the balance is gonna be dragged down  by a news cycle that won’t shake the cops. "
18589,josh,Six out of ten were black or Hispanic.
18593,josh,We’re still doing this?
18596,josh,What is taking so long? 
18600,josh,You just said I always do.
18602,josh,Then I absolutely choose NOT helping me.
18605,josh,Sit down.  Where are the first numbers?
18607,josh,You said five minutes 15 minutes ago!
18609,josh,"Yeah, but the response rate didn’t stop, right? Everybody didn't go to bed. If they did  that would be phenomenal. It would be a phenomenon!"
18610,josh,America is talking and I’m trying to hear what they’re saying.
18611,josh,"Well, I don’t think that is what they’re saying but absent any other information..."
18612,josh,"Joey, it’s the State of the Union. We worked on this speech for three months!"
18616,toby,It doesn’t barely say that.
18617,toby,In fact it doesn’t say that at all. The only way it says that at all is if you remove some  words from it. 
18618,toby,"It says a well-regulated militia, being necessary for the security of the free state...  the government shall not infringe. The words regulated and militia are in the first sentence.  I don’t think the Framer’s were thinking of three guys in a Dodge Durango. "
18619,toby,"No. But I do know that if you combine the populations of Great Britain, France, Germany,  Japan, Switzerland, Sweden, Denmark and Australia you’ve got a population roughly the size  of the United States. We had 32,000 gun deaths last year and they had 112. Do you think it’s  because Americans are more homicidal by nature? Or do you think it’s because those guys have  gun control laws?"
18620,toby,"Mark, I’m gonna sit out the next segment."
18621,toby,"Yeah, I’ve got to see someone. I’ll get you a body.  Has she been waiting long?"
18628,toby,Excuse me for interrupting. I just wanted to remind you that there’s press coming in and  out of this area. 
18632,toby,"Mrs. Bartlet, the Blue Ribbon Commission..."
18641,toby,"It was in a section on education reform, Abbey and considering other options doesn’t mean  we’re caving on retirement age and you know it. So, what was your concern with the language?"
18643,toby,And our commitment is still absolute. We’re open to new ideas and that’s what it said.
18645,toby,"Believe me, we gave Republicans plenty to be pissed about... the surplus, missile  defense, capital gains. And I was just on T.V. for the 900th time and alienated gun  owners... to say nothing of people who own Dodge Durango’s. So, what exactly was your  problem with the language?"
18651,c.j.,I’m C.J. Cregg.  I’m the White House Press Secretary and I’m  sorry to get you out of the party.
18652,c.j.,I’m sorry to be abrupt but I’m racing the clock a little bit.
18653,c.j.,Could you tell me what happen 17 years ago with a suspect named Walter Tapus?
18654,c.j.,I can access the information through the FBI and call the Wayne county DA...
18655,c.j.,I don’t think you do but if you’d like to call...
18656,c.j.,So you fractured his leg.
18657,c.j.,He said you kicked him repeatedly while he was handcuffed.
18659,c.j.,Why didn’t you tell anybody this was on your record when you were invited here?
18661,c.j.,"No, but I have to tell them."
18662,c.j.,Cause they’ll find out and I have to stay ahead of the pitch. If I issue it in a brief  statement then it doesn't look like we’re trying to hide anything and I get to control  the story for a while.
18664,c.j.,The President pointed to you as an example.
18666,c.j.,Cause they’ll find it anyway.
18668,c.j.,You should go back there.
18669,c.j.,Don’t talk to anybody about this.
18670,c.j.,I wish you had said something to us before.
18674,josh,When’s the power going back on?
18678,josh,Call Sam.  I want the numbers!
18680,josh,You’re the only one who’s having fun with this. Nobody else is having fun with this.
18681,josh,Are those numbers safe?
18682,josh,Are we gonna be able to make the West Coast calls?
18693,josh,"We’re five minutes away from an East Coast sample. We got nothing west of Indiana, Illinois..."
18695,josh,"A lightning bolt, a key, and a kite."
18697,josh,"Hey, can I tell ya Donna’s been acting kind of..."
18706,bartlet, I owe you money for that?
18708,bartlet,I owe you anything for that?
18711,bartlet,Don’t you already get paid?
18713,bartlet, Is there anything in particular you’d like me to say?
18719,bartlet,What’s going on with the police officer?
18721,bartlet,We’re going to get knocked off the story by a...
18725,bartlet,They can be identified as drug agents?
18726,bartlet,"Yeah, they may have blown their cover. "
18727,bartlet,"Mickey, how do we know they’re still alive?"
18728,bartlet,And they kill our guys unless Santos releases Juan Aguilar from a prison in Bogotá.
18735,bartlet,How many Frente casualties?
18738,bartlet,You think we’re headed for Vietnam?
18741,bartlet,How long is it going to take Special Forces to mobilize?
18742,bartlet," Well then, I want our people to keep talking to Nelson Guerra.  But in three hours I want to be ready to kick in the back door."
18743,bartlet,"Leo, I’d like the Senior Staff. Would you round them up? "
18745,bartlet, I’ll be wandering the halls.
18757,josh,Joey... can I ask you what may be a silly question?
18758,josh,"It’s not possible is it for us to just open one of these computers with a screwdriver and  get the numbers that are in there, right?"
18779,bartlet,I never even knew we HAD a nightclub down here.
18781,bartlet,"Yeah. Ainsley, I wanted to say hello and to you know... mention ""a lot of people  assumed you were hired because you’re a blonde, republican sex kitten"" and well,  they’re obviously wrong. Keep up the good work. "
18782,bartlet, You know we’re meeting?
18786,c.j.,"Well, the reception's still going on. I don’t know if you can hear the music. And the  President and Mrs. Bartlet are likely to stay up late with friends."
18791,c.j.,"Mark, I talked to the guy. And before the stampede begins... "
18792,c.j.,...please give me a chance...
18793,c.j.,Let me talk to you before...
18794,toby,Leo Mc Garry would like you to meet an old friend of his.
18795,c.j.,"Mark, give me 20 minutes before you break the story."
18796,c.j.,We’ve done things together.
18799,bartlet,They said you were in here.
18804,bartlet,"Abbey, so I indicated we were open to new ideas. How did I fail you this time?"
18810,bartlet,To make a 90 minute speech into an 80 minute speech things had to go.
18818,bartlet, That’s not what tonight’s...
18820,bartlet,That was three years ago.
18822,bartlet,I have Special Forces headed to Columbia on ready alert. They'll be ready for an order  in a little less than three hours.
18824,bartlet,The Frente took five DEA Agents in Putumayo...
18829,bartlet,All right.  I’ve got to go.
18832,bartlet,It was just three hours ago I gave the State of the Union. 
18836,bartlet,I'm not allowed to smoke inside anymore. 
18838,bartlet,Up to the point where you accidentally burn holes in priceless antiques. 
18842,bartlet,I smoke two cigarettes a day. 
18844,bartlet,"For who... Russian spy satellites?  George Bernard Shaw says, ""You don't live  longer, it just seems longer."""
18846,bartlet,I'm not sure it was either.  Is it time?
18848,bartlet,Where are we? Everyone sits. 
18849,bartlet,Tell me what happens when I give the order.
18850,bartlet,What'll they do when they get there? 
18853,bartlet,Nineteen guys are going to have to lie face down in the jungle until sunset? 
18854,bartlet,They're moving the hostages from where to where? 
18856,bartlet,Code name's Cassiopeia. 
18857,bartlet,"Mickey, you look like you want to say something. "
18862,bartlet,"Are we going to keep them alive longer, or is it just going to seem longer? "
18863,bartlet,I've been given reason to believe they'll be tortured at Villacerreno. They're U.S. drug  agents. They know things these people want to know.
18865,c.j.,Officer Sloane? Would you be willing to go on television tomorrow? 
18868,c.j.,Would you be willing to go on T.V.? 
18869,c.j.,This is going to be a part of the news cycle tomorrow whether you go home or not. 
18870,c.j.,Roughly the same way I knew there were 8700 words in the speech. I have some experience  at this.
18871,c.j.,"You'll do a very quick satellite interview.  ""What was it like being at the  State of the Union?"" ""Did you meet the President""... It was a thrill and an honor.  ""Talk about your act of heroism that brought you to the attention of the White House...""  Well, I wouldn't really call it heroism but...""Now, I understand you had some trouble  back in the early 80's... I'm glad I have a chance to talk about that."" And you tell  your story just like you told it to me. "
18874,c.j.,Would you make sure officer Sloane gets back to his hotel? 
18875,c.j.,I was called in for a meeting. 
18876,c.j.,I was called in for a meeting...
18877,c.j.,"It's not midnight everywhere in the world, Mark! "
18879,c.j.,"No, a Grand Jury, a DA and a Civil Court Judge decided 17 years ago. Nobody brought  charges and the civil suit was dismissed. "
18880,c.j.,The Detroit police department cited him for excessive force to calm down the black  community. It was a robbery. They were climbing through windows and jumping over walls.  The guy's leg was already fractured when Sloane got there. He's going to do your show  tomorrow morning. 
18882,c.j.,'Cause you waited 40 minutes. 
18888,toby,I'll bet he wants to have a meeting with me. 
18890,toby, It's not gonna happen.
18892,toby,It's not gonna happen. 
18893,toby,We got enough input from him during the six weeks we were writing the thing. I don't  need to hear his...
18899,toby,"Well, we're going to have to learn to live with that pain. "
18901,toby,He's not the President of the United States. He's a junior Senator from North Dakota  where nobody lives! Cause it's too cold and they don't have a major sports franchise. 
18905,toby,Stop laying out the ways.
18907,toby,Stop laying out the ways! 
18911,toby, And you expect me to explain myself to him. 
18915,c.j.,"The Post is calling it  ""sleek, challenging, and often times witty.""  Not, unlike myself. "
18916,toby,Who's Jack Sloane and why am I just hearing about this now? 
18917,c.j.,Sloane was one of the invited guest. He was the police officer. 
18918,toby,The one we stepped in over the weekend? 
18921,c.j.,A long time ago he was cited by the Detroit Police Department for excessive force. 
18922,toby,Against a black suspect? 
18926,toby,How was this guy not vetted?! 
18927,c.j.,Cause he wasn't. Cause it was last minute.
18928,toby,What are you doing about it? 
18929,c.j.,Mark Gottfried's going to interview him in the morning. 
18934,toby, Cause blacks aren't going to react well to our supporting a brutal cop. 
18935,c.j.,He's not a brutal cop. 
18937,c.j.," Says me, a Grand Jury, 2 Judges, the District Attorney and common sense! "
18938,c.j.,"It's going public anyway, Toby. Gottfried got the story on his own. "
18940,c.j.,He went back to the phone banks. 
18941,toby,Is the electricity back on? 
18943,toby,Then what's he doing there? 
18944,c.j.,Hoping the electricity goes on. 
18945,toby, Well that ought to do it. 
18949,josh,Oh God.  Please don't...
18959,josh,I'm thinking of firing you. 
18961,josh,Among other things.  Yeah?
18964,josh," Okay. Folks, we'll start over tomorrow night! "
18967,josh,I'm not good at waiting.
18971,josh,We're asking different questions. 
18980,bartlet,This isn't cold. It's crisp. 
18982,bartlet,"Well, you're a big wussie. "
18984,bartlet,It'll leave the Bishop open. 
18988,bartlet,Abbey's pretty pissed at me. 
18992,bartlet,You know I have this image in my mind of the dead soldiers coming back from Vietnam...  the caskets coming off the plane. I don't know from where. 
18994,bartlet, Caskets coming off the plane? 
19000,bartlet,I'll see you in the morning. 
19002,josh,Can I tell you something strange? 
19004,josh," All last night at the phone banks, Donna was telling me I should ask Joey  Lucas out. "
19006,josh,Fine. But... that aside. What do you make about Donna being the one pushing...
19008,josh,You wouldn't think she'd be jealous? 
19014,josh,I don't like it and usually do everything within my considerable capabilities to  sabotage it. 
19016,josh, is a very attractive woman! 
19023,bartlet,Thanks for having breakfast with me. 
19025,bartlet,Did you order something? 
19027,bartlet, You want scrambled eggs? 
19029,bartlet,Could we get these guys some scrambled eggs? 
19031,josh,"Then... we're fine, too. "
19035,bartlet,"Bring them some food, would ya? "
19036,bartlet,You guys understand I can't discuss with you any rescue mission that may or may not be  in play right now? 
19038,josh,I'm assuming State has people negotiating with Nelson Guerra? 
19039,bartlet,Nelson Guerra wants me to tell President Santos to release Juan Aguilar from prison. 
19040,josh,I wouldn't make that phone call with a gun to my head. 
19041,bartlet,"I have a gun to my head and I'm not making that phone call. I inherited the war on drugs  from a President, who inherited it from a President, who inherited it from a President  before that. I'm not a hundred percent sure who we're fighting, but I know we're not  winning. Ten years ago we spent $5 billion fighting drugs and we did such a good job that  last year we spent $16 billion. Sixty percent of Federal prisoners are in jail on drug  charges as opposed to two and a half percent that are there for violent crime. We  imprison a higher percentage of our citizens than Russia did under Communism and South  Africa under Apartheid. Somewhere between 50 and 85 percent of our prison population has  a drug or alcohol abuse problem. We've tried ""just say no."" I don't think it's going to  work.  I'm mentioning this because I'd like you to give me any  thoughts you might have on the subject. "
19042,josh,"Thank you, Mr. President. "
19060,toby,It happened five minutes before the man walked into the House chamber. You're a Junior  Senator from North Dakota and you don't get script approval  on the State of the  Union! 
19062,toby,What exactly is the danger of studying new options? 
19063,toby,Diverting General Revenue into the trust fund is not reform. 
19064,toby,How many votes did you get for it last year? 
19066,toby,"82 U.S. Senators think your reform bill sucks. So unless you have a plan for picking up  a majority, I don't know what's so wrong with saying we're open to hearing new ideas? "
19067,toby,It's simply not what we're doing.
19068,toby, Are there cameras on someplace? 
19069,toby,...and ruling the galaxy. 
19070,toby,"The President is not a member of your party. He is the leader of your party. And if you  think demonizing people who are trying to govern responsibly is the way to protect our  liberal base, then speaking as a liberal... go to bed, would you please! "
19071,toby,We admonished environmental terrorism. 
19073,toby,We made more than we lost. 
19074,toby,You just named three groups that'll never desert the President. 
19075,toby,"I was just thinking about this cartoon I once saw. A bunch of tiny fish are swimming  through the leaves of the plant but then one of the fish realizes it's not a plant,  it's the tentacles of a predator. And the fish says, ""with friends like this, who needs  anemones?"" "
19076,toby,"Come at us from the left, I'm gonna own your ass. "
19089,bartlet,"You aren't leaving till tonight, right? "
19091,bartlet,Men and women are completely different in this regard. 
19093,bartlet,"I don't know. I just had breakfast with Sam and Josh. Toby's having breakfast with  Seth Gillette, who's every bit as pissed at me as you are."
19096,bartlet,We didn't get a chance to talk again last night. 
19106,bartlet, Yes and I'd like to go about my day without this black cloud around me so  I'd like to talk now! 
19108,bartlet," What are you, my Zen master? Can I be in charge of my own mind?! "
19110,bartlet, I feel better already. 
19111,josh,I'm on hold.  I'm in some hellish hold world of holding. 
19119,josh,That'll be a lot of fun. 
19123,josh,There are five Congressional districts that are concerning me. 
19125,josh,Kentucky 3rd... that's Louisville. 
19127,josh,"Yeah, Louisiana 4th, Missouri 9th, Missouri 6th, and Ohio 12th. "
19129,josh,The President last night announced a crime package that would among other things...
19131,josh,The five Congressmen in those districts...
19139,josh,Why are you asking me a question when you're going to have the conversation all by  yourself? 
19144,josh,Why are you trying to... fix me up... with Joey Lucas? 
19154,c.j.,"How you doing, Ainsley? "
19185,bartlet,Why is she still in there? 
19187,bartlet,Why don't we get her out here? 
19189,bartlet,"Ainsley, why don't come on out of there..."
19190,bartlet,How you doing? We met last night.  You were singing and dancing in a  bathrobe. 
19191,bartlet,Why were you in the closet? 
19192,bartlet,They won't let me smoke inside but you can pee in Leo's closet. 
19193,bartlet,"I appreciate you coming to work for me, Ainsley. You're an exceptionally bright young  woman. Is your father proud of you?"
19194,bartlet,I bet he is.  Listen...
19197,bartlet,"Charlie, get the door. "
19199,bartlet,Did we lose the hostages? 
19200,bartlet,What are you talking about? 
19202,bartlet,What are you talking about?! 
19204,bartlet,How many guys were on the Blackhawk? 
19205,bartlet, So I've got nine more guys now on the ground we've got to get back. 
19208,bartlet,I want the President of Colombia on the phone. I want a translator in this room right now. 
19210,bartlet,How the hell did that happen? 
19214,bartlet,We've never anticipated the possibility that somebody might try that? 
19216,bartlet, IS THAT HOW I JUST LOST NINE GUYS TO A DAMN STREET GANG WITH A HAM RADIO!?
19222,bartlet,Is somebody translating on the other end? 
19223,bartlet," Mr. President, this is the President of the United States. "
19224,bartlet," Mr. President, 90 minutes ago the United States invaded  Colombian airspace. Two Blackhawk helicopters went into Tres Encinas with 20 Delta  Commandos on intelligence that the hostages were being moved. One of the Blackhawks  was shot down. They were nine military fatalities."
19225,bartlet, I'd like to ask for your assistance in confirming that the five hostages  are still alive.
19229,bartlet," I'm not going to ask you, Miguel."
19231,bartlet," Well, I appreciate your making that offer but I don't think  that's a very good idea. "
19232,bartlet," Okay. Thank you, Mr. President."
19234,toby," Hang on a second Sam, you give into terrorist demands and that's the ballgame! "
19236,toby,"Ah, it's real easy to stick to principles when nothing's at stake Sam! "
19238,bartlet,Juan Aguilar runs one of the largest drug cartels in the world. 
19240,bartlet,He has produced $15 billion worth of cocaine in two years. 
19241,bartlet,"He's murdered or ordered the murder of eight Supreme Court justices, a pro-extradition  Prime Minister and three Federal police officers in Bogotá. And from his prison cell I  guarantee you he orchestrated the kidnapping of five U.S. DEA agents and the killing  of their rescuers! "
19243,bartlet,I'm not letting him out.  I'll share a cell with him before I let  him out. I want military options! 
19249,josh,She'll bring me the numbers here? 
19256,josh,And who calls the families of the nine commandos who just died trying to save five guys  it turns out we could've freed six hours ago. 
19258,josh,The good enough reason is you give in to terrorists it gives them a pretty good incentive  to keep terrorizing. 
19262,josh,You don't think they're going to kidnap another five people tomorrow morning and demand  twelve months of free cable? 
19264,josh,How about the keys to the Situation Room? 
19266,josh,Where?  Did she say about an hour? 
19270,bartlet,Do we know where they are? 
19271,bartlet,What would it take to get them back?
19273,bartlet,What would it take to wipe them out? 
19274,bartlet,Yeah. What would it take? 
19276,bartlet, You've really got to ask yourself what's the point in being a Super Power  anymore. 
19281,bartlet, And then there's the repack! 
19282,bartlet,"First there's the preliminary, or the dry run. Then there's the actual packing.   Abbey, you're just going away for two days, right? "
19288,bartlet,"A guy with a shoulder thing shot down a Blackhawk. Everybody's dead.  Nine guys. Meanwhile, they've moved the hostages 60 miles into the jungle where we'd  need a pair of tweezers to get them out. "
19292,bartlet,No.  I didn't make the decision to run again. I wouldn't do that without you. 
19295,bartlet,I didn't make the decision to run again! 
19297,bartlet,"That's what we do, Abbey. We run for things! From the day a Congressman is sworn in he's  got to raise $10,000 a week so he can get reelected! A President gets to govern for 18  months. We try to get people to vote for us and in the process we hope the people force  us to do good things. "
19305,bartlet,I've had one episode in two years. 
19307,bartlet, I know what it's going to...
19316,bartlet,Call me when you get there. 
19322,josh,"A five day waiting period, that's all. A person can't wait five days to buy a gun?  If someone needs a gun right now, right this second, isn't that something the public  should be concerned about? "
19328,josh,All right. We'll call it a full day. But come in early in the morning. 
19330,josh,You all right getting home? 
19332,josh,They're not gonna change. 
19333,josh,Five day waiting period... 
19335,josh,I didn't need nationwide. I needed those five districts. Now we're gonna have to dial  down the gun rhetoric in the Midwest. 
19336,josh,Because these numbers just told us that...
19339,josh,Believe me when I tell you that's not true. 
19342,bartlet,"Hey, Charlie. You shouldn't be out here without a coat. "
19347,bartlet,"Let me tell you something, Leo...  After heroin and cocaine, tobacco is next. "
19349,bartlet,"Leo, I can't possibly reverse our..."
19351,bartlet,I can't possibly reverse our position on negotiating...
19353,bartlet,There were just 14 people in this room who heard Santos make me the offer. 
19355,bartlet,You know what Truman Capote said was the bad part about living outside the law? 
19357,bartlet,"You no longer have the protection of it. What's to stop me? Two hundred CIA operatives...  Black Ops. Two hundred guys with no wives, no kids, no parents.  I send 200  operatives down there. Monday morning I read in the paper Juan Aguilar is dead. What's  to stop me? "
19359,bartlet,It was the Queen's Rook. That's why I couldn't trade the Bishop. It was over six moves  ago. Arrange for their immediate release. 
19361,bartlet, If they so much as experience turbulence on their way out...
19363,bartlet,I want to go to Dover later tonight. 
19367,c.j.,Good evening. Thank you for coming back so late. 
19368,c.j.,"... Pentagon, State Department and Justice Department who'll continue with your questions."
19369,c.j.,...Putumaya region of Colombia by members of the Frente. 
19370,bartlet,I'll call their families afterwards...
19371,c.j.,"...whose name we are not releasing at this time. President Miguel Santos, acting on his  own authority has..."
19377,josh,"Efficiency and professionalism, and we're out of here at nine o'clock on a Wednesday night. "
19379,josh,"Yeah, well, there does seem to be a little less work to do when he's in a different  hemisphere, but nonetheless... "
19381,josh,"With a healthly dollop of leadership skills... the well-placed, well-worded memo.  Nobody goes off the reservation, everybody does their job. Turn off your computer.  Let's go. "
19385,josh,What's she talking about? 
19388,josh,What's she talking about? 
19390,josh," ""That's not for me to say. I can tell you that marijuana poses no greater  public health risk than nicotine or alcohol..."" "
19392,josh," ""Yet, bizarrely, to many of us in the health care profession, the law  categorizes it as a Schedule I narcotic while putting a government seal on a pack  of cigarettes."" "
19395,josh, I need you to take a look at this. 
19397,josh,"It’s a transcript of an online chat Millicent Griffith just did, page 8. "
19399,josh,I can’t talk to him right now. 
19401,josh,I’m gonna be there in a minute.
19402,c.j.," ""The Allman brothers? "
19404,c.j.,"""Marijuana poses no greater public health risk than nicotine or alcohol doesn’t show  the same addictive properties as bizzarely categorized as..."" and I quit! "
19406,c.j.,Is she kidding me with this? 
19409,josh,She finished five minutes ago. Talk me through the next twelve hours. 
19410,c.j.,"These people got a story. I guarantee you they called AP already... Carol, get me the  wires."
19411,c.j.,"It’s too late for the Times and the Post, but L.A. and San Francisco will have it. It  will be above the fold, the Today show will lead with it, Russert’s gonna do a segment. "
19413,toby,"Guys, I’m in the Blue Ribbon meeting, I got labor yelling at me, I got a real situation  developing over there."
19414,josh,"Yeah, but there’s a bit of a situation developing here too. "
19417,c.j.,Page 8.  Why didn’t you call me? 
19418,josh,While it was happening? 
19422,josh,She finished about five or ten minutes ago. 
19425,toby,Why didn’t you get me? 
19426,josh,What were you going to do?
19433,toby,Josh was watching in real time. 
19434,josh,"I’m not gonna belay into the computer screen, Toby. "
19436,toby,"The Surgeon General, what are you talking about? "
19438,toby,She reversed our position on marijuana. 
19439,josh,All right. First things first what time is it in Tokyo? 
19440,toby,They’re fourteen hours ahead. 
19441,josh,I thought it was thirteen. 
19443,josh,So it’s fourteen hours ahead. 
19445,josh,"Are we sure it’s ahead, and not beind? "
19446,c.j.,"Guys, there are clocks on the wall. "
19447,josh,"Okay, so it’s almost 11 o’clock in Tokyo. "
19451,c.j.,And anybody else in my office. 
19452,toby,We’ll be in the Roosevelt Room.
19453,josh,"I’m sorry... 11 in the morning, 11 in the afternoon? "
19457,josh,So if it’s not a story until tomorrow morning then they’re not gonna have it until  tomorrow night. So we bought it! 
19466,c.j.,Which local - theirs or ours? 
19467,toby,It will be 7:00 P.M. Thursday in Japan when he leaves. 
19468,josh,And he lands here when? 
19470,c.j., This isn’t happening. 
19472,toby,He will have traveled back in time to what? 
19473,c.j.,Which puts him down in Washington at 6:00 P.M. Thursday. 
19474,josh,He’s gonna land in Washington an hour before he took off? 
19476,josh,And that’s not a story that beats the Surgeon General? 
19478,toby," I’m gonna go get yelled at some more. Josh, you need to get Leo. "
19482,josh,This clock should be in military time. 
19484,josh,The man’s gone a hundred and fifty hours. How can it be Thursday the whole time? 
19488,josh,What were you talking about before? 
19492,josh,The President denounced the movie? 
19494,josh,Then how can they run that ad? 
19497,josh,"Yeah.  Yeah, Leo, we got a couple of problems here."
19504,toby,"The AARP wants the President to put Seth Gillette on the Commission, so does the AFL-CIO,  it’s important to them and for that reason I think it’s got to be important to us. "
19508,toby,Which is why if we ask he’ll say no. 
19510,toby,"Yeah, but we can’t risk that. First of all, we need him on the Commission, or else labor  and seniors will be suspicious from the get go; second, if he’s not going to be on the  Commission, it can’t be because he turned us down. "
19514,toby,"Okay, well. Thanks for stopping by. "
19524,josh,"Well, there’d be fallout from women voters and, I’m pretty sure, the AMA, to say nothing  of the First Lady. "
19526,josh, I had about nine people on the conference call at several points  of longitude. When’s your first briefing? 
19528,josh,You think you're able to show support for the Surgeon General without supporting her  policy? 
19532,josh," C.J., did you know that Dr. Griffith was going to criticize  the administration’s drug policy last night? "
19533,c.j.,I don’t agree with your categorization of the comments; I think she expressed her opinion  about the health effects of certain illegal drugs. 
19534,josh,"Well, she basically called for the legalization of marijuana. Does the President agree  with it? "
19535,c.j.,"Wrong again, and I will refer you to the Surgeon General’s comments. When asked if  marijuana should be legalized, she said and I’m quoting, ""It’s not for me to say.""  And she’s right, and it’s important that people understand this. The Surgeon General’s  not a law-maker. She doesn’t set drug policy, the President does, and the President is  100% against legalizing drugs including marijuana. "
19537,c.j.,Leo wants me to show her support. 
19541,c.j.,"While I’m showing her support, what are you showing her? "
19547,josh,There's a little stiffness. 
19548,josh, When did you see my scar? 
19551,josh, Along with all manner of things. 
19553,josh,I was in great shape in college. 
19554,josh,"Millicent, what were you thinking about? "
19555,josh,"I understand, but your answers... "
19557,josh,The truth is different if you're a GP or a member of the Stanford Faculty Club than if  you’re the country's chief medical practitioner. 
19558,josh,Did you know that 69% of Americans oppose legalization? Only 23% support it. 
19559,josh,"Well, that's a shock. Did you know that the number gets even higher than that if you  limit the polling sample to Bob Marley and the Whalers? "
19560,josh,Is that what this is about? 
19561,josh,Because the criminal justice system is nowhere near your jurisdiction...
19563,josh," ""Yet bizarrely the law categorizes it as a schedule one narcotic?!"" "
19564,josh,I've had three conversations with Leo McGarry in the last 12 hours. The reason I've  come here...
19565,josh,"C.J.'s up there right now giving you our support. I'm sorry, but we need you to resign. "
19566,josh,"Dr. Griffith, I say this with all possible respect, but... you serve at the pleasure of  the President. "
19567,josh,"Okay.  Thank you, ma'am. "
19570,c.j.,"No, I don't know what the hell's going on there."
19571,c.j.,Not unless he did it in the shower. But he hasn't denounced it to me and he certainly  hasn't to the public.  That's all. See you this afternoon.
19574,c.j.,Please tell me what's going on with this movie. 
19584,c.j.,And then the Family Values Leadership Council took out an ad congratulating us for that? 
19592,c.j.,"""Prince of New York"" is Morgan Ross's movie. "
19594,c.j.,Morgan Ross went on Imus? 
19596,c.j.,Morgan Ross called the President a coward? 
19603,c.j.,This guy's trying to get a little free media by screwing with us! 
19605,c.j.,"I'm the enforcer, Sam. I'm gonna crush him, I'm gonna make him cry, and then I'm gonna  tell his momma about it!"
19607,c.j.,You wanna watch me make him cry?  
19611,c.j., That shouldn't be a problem.
19617,toby,"The President's a friend of labor, a friend of seniors, a friend of small animals..."
19618,toby,"We're running out of time, Lenny. We announced this thing at the State of the Union;  we've got to get it going."
19621,toby,"Forever? You mean if we never have another recession ever again? Then the fund can  withstand all of 30 years before going bankrupt. Unfortunately, the actuarial tables  say I won't be dead yet.  Guys... Gillette's a tough needle to thread. I want  to know that we have your trust, that whoever we do get will look out for your  interests and that you therefore will support the Commission."
19622,toby,Can I assume from your total silence and blank faces that you're all with me?
19627,josh,"No. Leo's gonna need to talk to her. In the meantime, you should start to walk back some  of what you said in the press room, all right? "
19628,c.j.,There's something stickier than the support I gave her in the press room. 
19630,c.j.,"Danny Concannon's quoting Eleanor Bartlet. She said, ""My father won't fire the Surgeon  General. He would never do that."" "
19635,bartlet,They're trying to export their way out of their own economic problems. 
19636,bartlet,"And by dumping low priced steel on the U.S., you know what they're asking for? "
19637,bartlet,"They're begging for a protectionist response. Steel and mining employ a hundred and  seventy thousand workers. They're not going to sit around while discount steel comes  flying into... how you doing?   They're going to want retaliatory tariffs, and you know what that means? "
19638,bartlet,A return to Smoot-Hawley and the Great Depression. 
19640,bartlet,"Leo, I'm walking over to the press and telling them that retaliatory tariffs are gonna  cost American taxpayers 800,000 dollars for every job saved. "
19650,bartlet,Why didn't you tell me six hours ago? 
19655,josh,That's not a reason to make it legal.
19657,josh,"Donna, parents are keeping kids away from drugs with a whip and a chair. It doesn't help  them out if we... "
19659,josh,"No, that's okay, it's just me, talking... "
19661,josh,Does he want to see me? 
19663,c.j.,"Welcome back, Mr. President. "
19664,bartlet,"Thank you.  I've had it, C.J. I've absolutely had it! "
19666,bartlet,What the hell is Danny Concannon doing calling my kids? 
19668,bartlet,He knows better than that! They all know better than that! But Danny... 
19670,bartlet,"C.J., you're going to suspend his credentials for six months, and I don't give a damn.  His paper wants to cover the President, they can send someone else. "
19671,c.j.,"Mr. President, Danny didn't call her. "
19672,bartlet,I was told it was Danny. 
19673,c.j.,"Yes, sir. She called him. "
19675,josh,"Good evening, welcome back Mr. President. "
19676,bartlet,"The Allman Brothers, Josh? "
19677,josh,"How was the flight, sir? "
19678,bartlet,"Tokyo is willing to show economic restraint, in exchange for a good fielding shortstop  and a left-handed reliever... Who's against us so far? "
19679,josh,"The Judiciary Committee, Government Reform and Oversight, Appropriations... "
19681,josh,They control the Surgeon General's budget. 
19682,bartlet,Who's coming to her defense? 
19683,josh,"The Cannabis Society, The Cannabis Coalition, E Cannabis Unum, The American Hemp League,  and Friends of Mary Jane."
19685,bartlet,"Yes, I understand I've been congratulated for denouncing a movie I've never heard of. "
19687,bartlet,I've got to hand it to you guys you've pulled off a political first. You've managed to win  me the support of the Christian Right and the Cheech and Chong Fan Club in the same day. 
19688,josh,Leo's seeing her tomorrow. 
19692,c.j.,"Thank you, Mr. President. "
19693,josh,"Thank you, Mr. President. "
19694,bartlet,Charlie? Would you arrange for my middle daughter to come see me at her earliest possible  convenience? 
19695,bartlet,"Ah, screw her convenience. Get her ass down here."
19701,toby,"Actually, it says that we should stand by the Sturgeon General. "
19705,toby,"Well, I think we should stand by her too. I just wanted to make sure we were agreed that  smoked white fish was pretty much on its own. "
19708,toby,You're with the ratings people? 
19710,toby,Today's attempt at ensuring our future. 
19712,toby,The first thing I have to do is be nice to a liberal Democratic Congresswoman. 
19714,toby,"Well, it was when I was married to her. "
19715,toby,Good to see you. Thanks for coming. You look fantastic. 
19722,toby,You're growing into that title very nicely. 
19723,toby,Heh. Yeah. Labor wants Gillette on the Commission. 
19725,toby,It's very important to them. 
19727,toby,We're one of their people. 
19728,toby,"No. But I bring you here, and we sit, and we have coffee, and we have Danish, in the hope  that calmer and, dare I say, prettier heads prevail."
19729,toby,I was referring to myself. 
19731,toby,"Right. This is really important, Andy. Can you help us? "
19740,bartlet,"...in consumer costs per job saved. Retaliatory tariffs on steel imports are a disaster.  Anyone wants to check my math, they're more than welcome to. "
19741,bartlet,"Anybody wants to shove the Golden Gate Bridge up Japan's ass, they're more than welcome  to do that too. "
19743,bartlet,"Ellie, thanks for coming. "
19745,bartlet,Did you get down here okay? 
19746,bartlet,Did you take an airplane? 
19748,bartlet,"That's because you go to school at Johns Hopkins, right? "
19749,bartlet,"And Johns Hopkins is in Baltimore. I'm asking 'cause Baltimore is a 45-minute car ride  from Washington, D.C. and we hardly see you anymore. So, I thought either you transfered  to a different medical school, they moved Johns Hopkins, or they moved Baltimore.  Are any of those things true? "
19750,bartlet,"Okay. And this is accurate, right? This quote. ""My father won't fire the Surgeon General.  He would never do that."" "
19751,bartlet,"Eleanor, when you put your head down, your hair falls in your face, and I can't see your  face, and I can't hear what you're saying. Now look at me, and talk to me!"
19752,bartlet,What the hell are you doing talking to a reporter? 
19753,bartlet," Well, I'm sure  before you gave the quote you cleared it with the Communications Office. I'm sure you  went over the exact wording with C.J. Cregg and coordinated with White House strategy  so that the timing was right in the news cycle. I'm certain you consulted the appropriate  party leadership because you're a pretty knowledgeable operative having spent so much  time with me. Ellie? "
19756,bartlet,"There is politics involved in this, Ellie. And you knew it would make me unhappy and  that's why you did it and that's cheap. "
19757,bartlet,"Well, you sure didn't do it to make me happy! "
19759,bartlet,"Mom gets back first thing in the morning, and we're running a movie tonight if you want  to stay over. "
19763,bartlet,"Send him in.  Charlie... Give me just a minute, would you? "
19766,toby,"No, I will not hang on. "
19767,toby,"Sad to say, Andrea, there aren’t a whole lot of members of the liberal wing of the  Democratic Party.  "
19768,toby,"Hey, Andy, people are living decades longer than anyone at this rate in 1935! "
19769,toby,"We want to consider everything, but we can’t consider anything, unless... "
19770,toby,"Because it’s the only way it’s gonna happen! Because you can’t solve Social Security and  ask people to run for election at the same time! So why not give politicians some cloud  cover and let them be lawmakers for a while? Fifteen people in a room with the door  closed; seven democrats, seven republicans, and the President of the United States, who  will not have a vote, and they walk out of that room, and with one voice they make a  recommendation to Congress and the American people! And nobody knows who was where!   "
19771,toby,"Listen, I read in the paper that I’m on the benefit committee for the Child Leukemia  Foundation. "
19772,toby,Why do you suppose the paper wrote that? 
19773,toby,I guess they must have. You don’t think it’d be a better idea if you asked me first? 
19775,toby,Skip over the first step and move right to the second. 
19777,c.j.," Toby, when you have a minute, can you stop by the office, and... "
19779,toby,"C.J., tomorrow morning I want you to announce that Seth Gillette’s joined the Blue Ribbon  Commission on Social Security. "
19781,toby,"Make sure the press knows the Senator put the Democratic Party above personal differences,  and that he put people above all. Make sure they know that he’s a patriot, and when the  President asked him to serve, Senator Gillette answered the call. "
19783,toby,Yeah. I just saw it at your press briefing tomorrow morning. 
19784,c.j.,"Okay, but this is really the last thing I’m doing before I quit. "
19801,josh,The President’s not talking. 
19803,josh,He usually talks during the movie.
19806,bartlet,Is that your resignation? 
19808,bartlet,Did you not think that playing down the dangers of drug use sent a dangerous signal  as well? 
19809,bartlet,"Millie, did you put her up to it? "
19810,bartlet,"""My father won’t fire the Surgeon General, he would never do that."" You didn’t put her  up to it? "
19811,bartlet,"You didn’t pick up the phone after Josh came to see you and say, ""Ellie, it’s your  godmother, let’s stick it to your old man, and paint him into a corner?"" "
19812,bartlet, Why haven’t I ever been able to get her to like me? I’m asking you. 
19817,bartlet,"I was running for President, where the hell was she? "
19818,bartlet,Not like Zoey and Liz. 
19819,bartlet,She’s always belonged to Abbey. 
19821,bartlet,How did I frighten her? 
19822,bartlet,"I was elected two years ago, she’s 24 years old! "
19823,bartlet,It never seemed to intimidate Zoey or Liz. 
19826,bartlet,"No, no, no. I will bear with the nonsense of the Christian right and the Hollywood  left and the AFL-CIO and the AARP and the Canubus society and Japan, but I will not  stand and allow someone to tell me that I love one of my children less than the others.   She’s frightened of me? "
19827,bartlet,"I wanted to be so mad at her. I heard the news and my first thought was... My god,  ""King Lear"" is a good play.  ""My father won’t fire the Surgeon General, he would  never do that."" I wanted to be so mad at her. But the truth is, it’s the nicest thing  she’s ever said about me. "
19831,bartlet,I don’t accept your resignation. 
19832,bartlet,These are the bigger things. I don’t accept your resignation.   You work for me. You go when I tell you to. 
19835,bartlet,"Tell C.J. when she gives Millie our support on Monday, she can mean it. "
19836,josh," You know, it’s going to seem to some people like you did it ‘cause your  daughter asked you to. "
19837,bartlet,"You know, Josh, I think if you ever have a daughter, you’re going to discover there  are worse reasons in the world to do something. Sit down, we’re coming to the good part. "
19839,bartlet,"I said, how you doing? "
19840,bartlet,"You know, we’re coming up to the good part. "
19841,bartlet,You want to bet me your tuition no one in this room is going to shush me? 
19842,bartlet,I hear you’re thinking about ophthalmology. 
19843,bartlet, Why would you want to study people’s feet? 
19844,bartlet,Then what’s children’s medicine?
19845,bartlet,I thought it was obstetrics. 
19846,bartlet,And what’s the study of feet? 
19847,bartlet,Hmmm?  The only thing you ever had to do to make me  happy was come home at the end of the day. 
19848,bartlet,"So, endocrinology would be what? Disorders of the gallbladder? "
19849,bartlet,"I’m pretty sure you’re wrong about that, I think endocrinology is your sub-specialty  of internal medicine, devoted to the digestive system. "
19850,bartlet,"Are you sure it’s not nephrology, immunology, cardiology, or dermatology? "
19851,bartlet,Okay. Here comes the good part.
19913,josh,And it gets better every year. But... 
19915,josh,"You’re not going to give it, right? "
19919,josh,"Yeah, see, but we know it’s Big Block of Cheese Day. And we know why it’s called Big  Block of Cheese Day. So, there’s really no need for the speech. "
19921,josh,"Well, let’s find out. Maybe it would. "
19931,josh,"Well, ‘cause you’re not sending me. "
19933,josh,"Leo, the World Bank and the WTO are international organizations of which the U.S. is one  member. Why isn’t Switzerland the one? "
19935,josh,"Well, that seems reasonable. "
19937,josh,But you’re still going to do the speech. 
19941,c.j.,"Leo, who made these assignments? "
19943,c.j.,I’m meeting with the Organization of Cartographers for Social Equality? 
19944,c.j.,What do mapmakers have to do with social equality? 
19946,c.j.,"Well, probably not, because I won’t really be listening to them. "
19951,toby, Excuse me. I was waylaid. 
19954,toby,"No, don’t call them protesters, I’ve seen better organized crowds at the DMV. "
19956,toby," In my day, we knew how to protest. "
19959,josh,How the hell old were you when you were protesting? 
19960,toby,My sisters took me.  Anybody have a problem with that? 
19962,toby,The police are always seven steps ahead of them. The cops know exactly where they’re  going to be and what’s going to happen. You know how they know? By logging onto their  website. We had the underground. We had rapid response. 
19963,c.j.,"And by God, you were home by supper on a school night. "
19964,toby,These people are amateurs. What’s my assignment? 
19972,toby,"Oh well, if Josh thinks it’s a good idea, then you bet, I’ll do it. "
19975,c.j.,I’ve got Cartographers for Social Equality. 
19976,josh,"So, now you have two choices... meeting with an unruly mob or meeting with lunatic  mapmakers. "
19977,toby,Or getting paid a lot more money working almost anywhere else I want. 
19986,c.j.,"You want to make out with me right now, don’t you? "
19987,toby,"Well, when don’t I?  Give me the thing. "
19989,josh,And a wheat thin the size of Lake Tahoe. 
20009,bartlet,I don’t really need to see the ten-year numbers.
20010,bartlet,Have the ten-year projections ever been close to accurate?
20011,bartlet,Within a trillion dollars.
20012,bartlet,"Okay. Bring me the ten-year projection, a Ouija board and a magic wand."
20015,bartlet,That name sounds familiar. 
20016,bartlet,Yes. I remember being locked in a steamer trunk. 
20017,bartlet,"There were actual steamers in there with me, Charlie. I was in there with seafood. "
20021,bartlet,"What plaid flannel-wearing, cheese-eating, yahoo of a milkman governor signed that idiot  bill into state law?  It was me, wasn’t it? "
20025,bartlet,"No, don’t go ahead with the site. I just...  Tell my brother to hang on, would you?  I’ll make a decision. I don’t know what the damn hurry is. "
20054,toby,How many different ways you know how to kill a man? 
20057,toby,It’s going to be a day at the beach. 
20073,josh,You on the Gault thing? 
20075,josh,That’s nice of you. I appreciate that. 
20077,josh,They’re not going to be happy about it. 
20079,josh,Did you know that Lincoln signed a pardon on the day he was assassinated? 
20081,josh,You know the guy’s name? 
20083,josh,You know what he was pardoned for? 
20087,josh,I was trying to make you laugh. 
20089,josh,Yeah. Can I tell him why? 
20091,josh,"Hey, you want to have a lot of fun? Seriously. Sit in on C.J.’s meeting with the  Organization of Cartographers for Social Equality. "
20093,josh,I don’t know. That’s why I’m going. 
20101,toby,"No, I mean fire at them.  Just kidding. "
20102,toby," Hey, Solzhenitsyn. Come here. You’re the group leader?"
20103,toby,"You know what you did today that was really stupid? You gave away the cameras. With  cameras in here I’ve got a problem ‘cause I don’t want to look like I can’t control  the crowd. Without the cameras, I can sit here, read the sports section for two hours,  walk outside and say we talked. So, if you guys want to talk, that’s fine. But you’re  in charge of crowd control, know what I’m saying?"
20104,toby,"Good morning...  Good morning, my name is Toby  Ziegler and I’m the White House Communications Director and a senior domestic policy  advisor to the President."
20105,toby, You want to send out for pizza or something? 
20132,c.j.,Okay. And you are the Organization of Cartographers for Social Equality. 
20136,josh,"Wait. Wait, I want to see this. "
20138,c.j.,"Josh, this is Dr. Fallow... "
20142,josh,Give me 200 bucks and it’s done. 
20143,c.j.,No. Why are we changing maps? 
20146,c.j.,Are you saying the map is wrong? 
20151,josh,"Wait, wait. Relative size is one thing, but you’re telling me that Germany isn’t where we  think it is? "
20153,c.j.,What the hell is that? 
20155,toby,"Well, it’s not like being at a Yankee game. "
20156,toby,"Well, actually...  Yeah, it’s like being at a Yankee game. "
20158,toby,"It’s about the WTO, Rhonda, the World Trade Organization. "
20159,toby,The World Trade Organization’s a group of 140 countries who have agreed to specific trade  policies. 
20160,toby,Nothing’s wrong with that. 
20161,toby,They’d say the WTO benefits corporations and not people. 
20162,toby,Benefits both.  Look at them. 
20164,toby,"Yeah, make all the jokes you want but let me tell you something they claim to speak for  the underprivileged but here in the blackest city in America, I’m looking at a room with  no black faces. No Asians, No Hispanics. Where the hell’s the Third World they claim to  represent? "
20165,toby,You’re starting to bother me. 
20166,toby,"No, I like that.  I’m going outside. "
20192,c.j.,No. I’m wondering where France really is. 
20193,josh,"Guys, we want to thank you very much for coming in... "
20194,c.j.,Hang on. We’re going to finish this. 
20197,josh,I’m going to check in on Toby. 
20199,josh," These guys find Brigadoon on that map you’ll call me, right? "
20202,c.j.,But... wait. How... Where else could you put the Northern Hemisphere but on the top? 
20204,c.j.,"Yeah, but you can’t do that. "
20205,c.j.,‘Cause it’s freaking me out. 
20206,toby,"It’s activist vacation is what it is. Spring break for anarchist wannabes. The black  t-shirts, the gas masks as fashion accessories. "
20207,toby,"All right, that’s it, flatfoot. "
20208,toby,You want the benefits of free trade? Food is cheaper. 
20209,toby,"Food is cheaper, clothes are cheaper, steel is cheaper, cars are cheaper, phone service  is cheaper. You feel me building a rhythm here? That’s ‘cause I’m a speechwriter and I  know how to make a point. "
20210,toby,"It lowers prices, it raises income. You see what I did with ‘lowers’ and ‘raises’ there? "
20211,toby,"It’s called the science of listener attention. We did repetition, we did floating opposites  and now you end with the one that’s not like the others. Ready? Free trade stops wars. And  that’s it. Free trade stops wars! And we figure out a way to fix the rest! One world, one  peace. I’m sure I’ve seen that on a sign somewhere. "
20214,toby,What are you doing here? 
20215,josh,Came down to see how it was going.  How’s it going? Josh Lyman. 
20217,toby," Josh. The WTO is undemocratic, and accountable to no one, decisions  are made by Executive Directors and the developing world has little to say about  institutional policy. "
20221,toby,‘Cause I’m not allowed to get arrested anymore. 
20223,toby,"No, I hate these people with the heat of a nova. Yet here I go. "
20226,bartlet,"Let’s do calls in the residence, okay? "
20227,bartlet,I think there were a couple of late memos.
20230,bartlet,I’m going to head home. 
20232,bartlet,I’ll make calls from the residence. 
20236,bartlet,"Well, there’s this wooded land on the Connecticut River, but the Abenaki Indians are  claiming it’s an ancient burial ground. "
20238,bartlet,"There’s a magnificent bluff overlooking an orchard in Orford and the owner is willing,  if not eager, to donate the land. "
20240,bartlet,The owner’s doing 40 months at Allenwood for securities fraud. 
20242,bartlet,"This is how long I get before I have to start with the library? Two years? And the first  six months was figuring out how to work the phones? Oh, by the way, they’ve changed the  phones again. "
20244,bartlet,"This is the last job I’ve ever going to have. This is the last time I’m going to come to  work with people. I swear to God, I feel like I was just starting to get good at it. "
20249,bartlet,I’ll see you tomorrow. 
20302,josh,Hey...  You should have seen Toby. 
20304,josh,He blew the doors off the place. Then I almost got killed. 
20305,josh,I got hit with a piece of a banana. 
20307,josh," You know what you are? You are old school, my friend. "
20308,toby,Stop talking like that. Let’s go. 
20309,josh,"Let me tell you something, though. That was the second time this year I almost got killed  and both times I was with you so you’re going to need a new wingman. "
20310,toby,You were my old wingman? 
20314,josh,"Toby and I are going to get Sam drunk, and then put him to bed. "
20324,c.j.,It's a recipe for deep fried fantail shrimp.
20326,c.j.,He's got a recipe book.
20332,c.j.,"I can't cook, but I think there are probably like 20 or 30."
20336,c.j.,You can spend the night in New York.
20340,c.j.,Isn't it cold in Sag Harbor right now?
20344,c.j.,"Sam, seriously, there are more recipes than that."
20346,c.j.,Maybe he doesn't know about the sweaters.
20348,josh,Who gave him the recipe book?
20349,c.j.,"I really don't think we can blame this on the recipe book. Plus, I now know the secret to  cold asparagus chantilly is a quarter cup whipped cream."
20350,josh,"I'm going to Port Saint Lucie, which may not mean anything to you, but happens to be the  spring training home of the..."
20351,c.j.,"New York Jets. Yes, you've told me. Josh, you can watch basketball on T.V."
20352,josh,"Yes, except the New York Knicks are a basketball team, the New York Jets are a football  team, and Port Saint Lucie is the spring training home of the New York..."
20353,c.j.," Mets! Yes. Dammit, I'm inadequate."
20354,josh,"A weekend at spring training. Mike Piazza is going to be standing in the batting cage.  He's going to turn and see me. He's going to say, 'Dude.'"
20355,c.j.,"Well, I wouldn't want you to miss a legitimate 'dude' sighting."
20358,c.j.,"Guys, I'm sorry, but you know what? Listen, seriously, you're looking at democracy at  work, it's a beautiful thing."
20359,c.j.,"Well, I wouldn't think it would be that much longer."
20360,c.j.,"Yeah, but how many recipes can there be? 20? 30?"
20361,c.j.,"Yeah, but you know what, Mark? This is just the kind of thing that can cleanse the palate  of a relationship that's gone stale. Like a fine sorbet."
20362,c.j.,And she's already bitching about dinner?
20364,c.j.,"Listen up! Everybody, this was unforeseen. Obviously, he's got to finish sometime. When  he does, there will be a vote immediately. When it's done, the President will make his  calls, White House staff will be available for comment, and most important you will all  write about it. In the mean time, I say, pizza for everybody! Who's with me? "
20366,c.j.,"We're going to need like a massive truckload of pizza. And, I don't know, maybe some  Cuervo 1800 if we've got it lying around."
20368,toby,"C.J., just so you know, I need to be at Telluride first thing in the morning."
20369,c.j.,That's a rough assignment you pulled there.
20370,toby,"No, I'm saying, I already missed the 6:50 to Denver, but I can catch an 8:40 from  National if I change planes in Chicago."
20371,c.j.,"And as you're travel agent, it's important that you update me on that information."
20372,c.j.,I'm supposed to be on my way to Napa right now for my Dad's 70th birthday. You hear me  complaining?
20375,toby,It's your dad's 70th birthday?
20378,c.j.,"Yeah, we're all getting together in Napa."
20380,c.j.,No. I'm sitting and waiting. I'm ordering pizza. I'm catching up on e-mails.
20381,toby,All right. I got a a basketball game on in my office if you want to come by?
20382,c.j.,Is it the Jets and the Mets?
20383,toby,It's the Nets and the Hawks.  The Jets and the Mets?
20384,c.j.,I know the teams. I'm joking when I do this. I'm joking when I do this.
20386,toby,You know there's a 9:00 to SFO. You could drive to Napa.
20388,toby,All right. I'm in my office.
20390,toby,Do you have any idea how many recipes there are?
20392,c.j.,"You keep the floor as long as you hold the floor. What does that mean? It means you can't  stop talking, ever. You can't eat, and you can't drink, which is fine, because you can't  leave the chamber to use the bathroom, either. But all that's nothing compared to this:  you're not allowed to sit down. You're not allowed to lean on anything or, for that matter,  anyone. It started with the bill you'll read about tomorrow morning called the Family  Wellness Act. Josh had been leading staffers from the Legislative Liaison Office in  negotiations with the conference chairman for weeks and this last Monday morning he  walked into the Roosevelt Room and said..."
20393,josh,We got the Family Wellness Act.
20397,josh,We got most of what we wanted in Title VII.
20398,c.j.,That's infant hearing loss?
20399,josh,"Yeah, we got a hearing test for every child born in the U.S."
20401,josh,We did not get mandatory tests for children not born in hospitals.
20404,josh,"Right, this is a national campaign to provide information to the public regarding the  adoption of special needs children."
20406,josh,By agreeing to a provision that would require health care staff to give pregnant women  information about adoption on an equal basis with all other courses of action.
20407,c.j.,National Organization for Women's gonna hate that.
20409,c.j.,Women seeking abortions should not be required by law to be lectured at.
20410,josh,"Yeah, but you're gonna help me out there, right?"
20411,c.j.,"Yes, I will. I will once again and betray the sisterhood."
20412,c.j.," Okay, I saw you, you, you, and you roll your eyes."
20416,josh,"I know, I'm thinking seriously about turning pro."
20418,josh,"Yeah, I got agents talking to me, telling me I could go high in the second round, maybe  low in the first if I have a good postseason."
20420,josh,"Nah, I'm white, nobody's gonna mind."
20422,josh,That's the way it's gonna happen.
20424,josh,I'd feel better if it meant just once I could go to a doctor without filling out  something on a clipboard.
20426,toby,"Philip Sluman, who's the chairman of the Petroleum Producers of America, testified  yesterday to the FTC that ""the Bartlet administration's"" - blah, blah - ""relentless  pursuit of emissions standards in the form of additives like MTBE is a big reason  we've seen price hikes in some parts of the country."""
20428,toby,The Energy Secretary's gonna respond and I'd like to mention that to the Vice President.
20443,c.j.,Imagine being the girl he dated who he didn't marry.
20447,c.j.,They should talk to the gift officer.
20450,c.j.,"Did you say a small, ceramic statue?"
20453,c.j.,"Well, I have to think about it, Charlie. It was a year ago, and it's not like I have  instant recall of every ceramic cat statue I've ever been handed in Cairo."
20454,c.j.,Tell Protocol I'm searching my recollection.
20457,toby,"I'm going to see Hoynes, talk to me later."
20459,c.j.,"Some information, possibly a disguise, and a fast getaway car. Come inside."
20460,toby,"Good morning, Mr. Vice President."
20461,toby,I knew it was pretty big.
20462,toby," Philip Sluman, testifying yesterday in front of the FTC, charged that it  was the White House's pursuit of tighter emissions standards that's caused the rise  in prices..."
20463,toby,"Mr. Vice President, I don't want to go round and round with you on Sluman."
20466,toby,It costs marginally more to refine the fuel with the additives and the cost is being  passed on to the consumer at an outrageous markup.
20467,toby,"Well, it's good to know the companies can make it through the lean times."
20468,toby,"Anyway, sir, tomorrow night, Bill Trotter's gonna be delivering a speech to the Detroit  Economic Counsel on Energy Efficiency in the 21st century, and we're gonna rewrite the  draft to include a fairly strong rebuttal to Phillip Sluman's remarks."
20474,toby, Would you mind if I prepared some notes for you?
20475,toby," No, sir... well, thank you, sir, we appreciate it."
20476,toby,We scheduled the vote for Friday at noon.
20477,toby,"Thank you, Mr. Vice President. "
20478,c.j.," Well, somebody forgot to tell Stackhouse, Dad, cause he just went into  hour number eight."
20483,c.j.,You can put the black seven on the red eight.
20485,c.j.,"Hey Sam, who's your favorite writer?"
20487,c.j.,Who's your favorite fiction writer?
20491,c.j.,"You know I never got a chance to say... I mean, I feel bad about your dad and  everything."
20493,c.j.,I'm in the middle of an e-mail to my father.
20495,c.j.,Not enough. You're gonna miss the last plane.
20497,c.j.,"Okay. Well, I just came down to get this coffee."
20499,c.j.,"Hey, did I hear you got spanked by some 14-year-old kid interning at the GAO?"
20511,c.j.,I'm taking my coffee with me.
20513,josh,Write this down. I need to find out if sufficient funds have been appropriated to the  FAA to begin work on data-link communications.
20514,josh,That's when you get me on the phone. Sam...
20517,josh,"Can we show you something from the back, or...?"
20519,josh,"Okay, here's one. Uh... the White House has been instructed by Congress to compile a  list of 400 government reports that should be eliminated as they serve little purpose  and cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars."
20521,josh,Right. You're not in this meeting. You're shopping for fruit.
20531,josh,"Well, start getting used to it for a while."
20532,toby,Let me talk to you for a second.
20534,toby,I was just with Hoynes.
20535,josh,About Sluman's testimony?
20544,toby,He said he wanted to do it himself.
20548,toby,He said he's doing a press conference tomorrow on...
20550,toby,"Yeah, and he'll take questions at the end. And they'll ask about the Sluman testimony,  and he'll step up."
20551,josh,"Well, somebody's got to be there."
20552,toby,"Oh, I'm gonna be there. If he ducks, Trotter goes on in Detroit. But, still, is it  clear to you what he's doing?"
20594,c.j.,"Back to the cat story dad, I've done my research, and sure enough, I was quite screwed.  I was in trouble, and I needed to tell someone, a cohort. Someone whose criminal mind  is equal to my own."
20595,c.j.,"Donna, I need to talk to you right now."
20597,c.j.,"So, we went to Cairo last year."
20601,c.j.,I didn't which is sad for me.
20603,c.j.,"I may be in a spot of trouble, yes."
20605,c.j.,"Hassan Ali gave the President a gift, a small ceramic statue of Bast."
20607,c.j.,Bast. A cat goddess. She was...
20609,c.j.,She was the patron saint of Bubastis and rose to prominence during the period of the  22nd Dynasty.
20611,c.j.,I looked it up. The cats in the temple...
20613,c.j.,"The temple of Bubastis, maybe, I don't know. The cats in the temple wore jeweled  collars. They were treated royally. They thought cats controlled the movement of  the moon. They had total authority over royal houses because of their ability to  see in the dark. Anyone who killed a cat was put to death."
20615,c.j.,"I broke the damn statue. Not badly, but you know, in several pieces. And since it came  out of his own collection, breaking the figurine would amount to a personal affront  implying he had bad taste, and that the object was of little personal value to the  President."
20617,c.j.,The gift officer handed it to me. I tossed it in my suitcase.
20619,c.j.,Do you have any idea how many pieces of crap gets stuck in the President's hands every  time he leaves the building?
20621,c.j.,"Well, apparently not, because she handed it to me with a couple of T-shirts and a box of  baklava."
20623,c.j.,I thought maybe you'd have an idea.
20634,josh,"Yeah, I'm not taking it."
20636,josh,He wants an amendment added to the Family Wellness Act that'll allocate money for  autism care and research.
20638,josh,"This is what's called a ""Christmas tree bill."" Everyone hangs amendments on it. We just  closed it this morning. We try to hang a star on top..."
20640,josh,"Yeah, Stackhouse isn't really someone who has a lot of muscle on this, so..."
20646,josh,Sounds like a bad cold.
20651,josh,The bill started out at two billion. It's six billion now.
20653,josh,I don't need to tell you that in these negotiations...
20655,josh," There's no doubt that that's a good point, but in order for us to ensure that  more important things were in the bill..."
20657,josh,"Senator, there's going to be a vote. The bill's closed."
20658,josh,"To do that would mean to postpone the vote, and everyone's breaking for the recess, and..."
20660,josh,"Sir, the next time around, and there will be a next time around..."
20670,josh,It's still a seventy mile drive to Port St. Lucie. I'll miss the game.
20672,josh,It's an exhibition game.
20674,josh,"Actually, it's an intrasquad game."
20678,josh,I gotta fly to New Jersey to get to Palm Beach?
20680,josh,Whatever. Just make sure that tomorrow morning...
20684,josh,I'm writing an e-mail to my mother.
20686,josh,To thank her for a pair of shoes she sent me.
20688,josh,"Donna, please try and keep it..."
20696,bartlet,Come have dinner with me.
20698,bartlet,Pierre Boileau is cooking tonight. You want to have dinner?
20702,bartlet,"Well, I can tell you that the man specializes in a reinterpretation of classic Provençale  cuisine. Cassoulet, duck with green olives..."
20706,bartlet,"Well, don't you think you deserve one?"
20708,bartlet,"His specialty is his dessert, tomate du saltambique."
20710,bartlet,"Passion fruit, kiwi and hazelnuts, and..."
20712,bartlet,Let's go. Leave the cell phone.
20714,bartlet,We're not leaving the building. People can find you.
20720,bartlet,Could Howard Stackhouse possibly be a bigger horse's patoot?
20722,bartlet,"He's a curmudgeon, a grouchy old crank."
20724,bartlet,You are. I am full of mirth.
20726,bartlet,"He was all over me the first year. He called me, ""Bartlet the Inert."""
20728,bartlet,"I'm a reformer. I'm the most liberal President he's ever served under. His hero, Hubert  Humphrey, once, you know..."
20730,bartlet,That's right.  I feel bad.
20732,bartlet,His wife died a few years ago. I didn't go to the funeral.
20734,bartlet,"I was kind of busy running for President, Leo."
20736,bartlet,"Tomate du Saltambique, my friend."
20738,bartlet,"Hi. Hang on.  They thought I was going to be eating with Abbey, so..."
20740,bartlet,"We'll just, you know, pretend there's no candlelight."
20744,bartlet,"Leo, you have a deputy who's, frankly, a lot smarter than you are. Whatever it is, let  him handle it. Who are you talking to?"
20755,c.j.,"Oh, holy hell. Tell Josh. Find out for sure."
20758,bartlet,"No, she's up at the Manchester house."
20759,bartlet,"No, it really sucks, but thanks."
20760,bartlet,"Did you hear that? He said, ""Very good, sir"". Where do they learn that?"
20764,bartlet,I just feel like we don't talk anymore.
20766,bartlet,See you're not even listing.
20768,bartlet,"I'm just saying we work all day, and then the day's over, and we go out to dinner and  you're still working, and you know, I'm sitting here. No time to talk."
20774,bartlet,I made a deal with Abbey... 'cause of my thing.
20776,bartlet," My thing, by the way, is the reason that Hoynes stepped up on oil."
20787,c.j.,"I didn't know what it was. I needed a potpourri holder. I have the ancient curse of Bast  on me so get off my back, Sparky."
20788,c.j.,"And the potpourri, right?"
20789,bartlet,How does he not just tell me?
20791,bartlet,"How does he not come to me and say ""Jed, this is my grandson and there are lots more like  him and there are lots more to come. Can you help us out?"""
20793,bartlet,Damn it. He knows we would have gotten it done. Why doesn't he tell me?
20796,c.j.,"Good evening, Mr. President."
20797,bartlet,"Hey. Hey Donna, you need something?"
20798,c.j.,Donna's the one who started sniffing around it.
20799,bartlet,"C.J., that phone message was for real. He's not going to stop till he drops."
20801,bartlet,"C.J., let me tell you something. Don't ever, ever underestimate the will of a  grandfather. We're mad men. We don't give a damn. We got here before you and they'll  be here after. We'll make enemies, we'll break laws, we'll break bones but you will  not mess with the grandchildren."
20804,bartlet,C.J.... If I told you to screw the print deadline what would you want to do right now?
20805,c.j.,I'd want to see if there's a way I could help him out.
20806,bartlet,Give him some dignity right? And give him a rest. The guy's going to collapse out there.
20808,bartlet,Screw the print deadline. Leo?
20810,bartlet,We will talk about the other thing later.
20818,bartlet,Though it's not the worst idea in the world.
20822,bartlet,I was in the House. I know nothing about Senate rules.
20824,c.j.,"I'm pretty sure it's true, sir."
20825,bartlet,What time is it? Let's wake up a parliamentarian.
20827,bartlet,We're going to get one of them to walk in there. Charlie!
20829,bartlet,"I want to call Senators. We'll start with our friends. When we're done with those two,  we'll go on to the other 98."
20831,c.j.,Start with the grandfathers.
20832,bartlet,There's no damn holiday for us either.
20834,bartlet,"C.J., no kidding, make this happen."
20835,c.j.,"Yes, sir.  Oh and, I broke you're statue."
20839,toby,"No, sir, you did it very well. I appreciate it."
20840,toby,I'm sure you know I was curious about why you'd volunteer for something like that.
20841,toby,So I got ahold of some private polling you've had done.
20842,toby,A significant number of people are concerned over your close ties to big oil.
20843,toby,"Yeah, but what I was wondering was why did you put the poll in the field at all?  Mr. Vice President, what do you know that I don't?"
20844,c.j.," Do I have your word on that, Sarah?"
20848,bartlet,"Trust me just this once, you grouchy old son of a bitch."
20853,toby,I’ve been thinking... about why Hoynes volunteered to slap down big oil.
20855,toby,"Yeah, but why did he put the poll in the field at all, is what I’m saying."
20857,toby," Well, that’s pretty unusual for Washington."
20859,toby," Leo, has there been a discussion in some room, some place, anywhere on  any level about Hoynes being dropped from the ticket in 2002?"
20863,toby,‘Cause I thought maybe it was an Eisenhower-Nixon...
20868,toby,The poll that Hoynes put in the field...
20870,toby," He’s going to run for President six years from now, what good does last  week's do?"
20874,toby,A Vice President would never challenge a sitting President for the nomination.
20876,toby,You see his itinerary for the weekend?
20880,toby,"He’s giving a speech at a semiconductor plant. The title of the speech is, ""Clean air  industry in the high-tech Corridor of the Industrial Northeast."""
20886,toby,Because it comes in the middle of a three-day camping trip to Killington.  Why does  Hoynes think the President isn’t going to run again? 
20889,bartlet,I closed the embassies in Tanzania and Brussels.
20891,bartlet,I don’t have to make that call yet.
20907,bartlet,He scheduled a trip to New Hampshire?
20914,bartlet,You think Toby’s reaction is going to be the same as the public’s?
20918,bartlet, The staff’s reaction will be what?
20929,josh,You know what the problem with this is?
20931,josh,It’s supposed to be funny.
20937,josh,You know what they did?
20939,josh,They forgot to bring the funny.
20941,josh,How much time do we have?
20945,josh,Sam and I are going to stay and punch up some of the jokes from the Correspondents’  Dinner.
20947,josh,They forgot the funny. 
20950,toby,Where are you going to be?
20952,toby,I’ll hook up with you in a little bit.
20959,josh,Did you get the flowers?
20963,josh,Do you know why I sent them?
20967,josh,I’m the sort of guy who remembers those things.
20971,josh,I sent them to mark an occasion.
20973,josh,For I am a man of occasion.
20975,josh,"Well, you started working for me once in February and then you stopped for a while."
20977,josh,"Then you started working for me again in April. That’s the one I choose to celebrate,  because it’s the only one where you started working for me and it wasn’t followed by  your not working but rather going back to your boyfriend, and how, in comparison to  that and him, you can call me mean is simply another in a long series of..."
20981,josh,"Sam and I are going to punch up the thing for tomorrow. Hey, we need funny people."
20984,josh,"See, right there was a joke. It’s the oldest joke in the book..."
20986,josh,"You know what, Ado Annie, I sent you flowers! I think what you’re trying to say is,  ‘Why, thank you, Josh! They’re beautiful! How very thoughtful of you. Not many bosses  would have been that thoughtful...’"
20988,josh,"Okay, well, then I guessed wrong."
20990,josh,"Yes, I do, because you are such an hysterically funny person... did you see how I used  ‘an’ there properly?"
20994,josh,"So the flowers really did the trick, huh?"
21018,toby,Sam’s going to work on it.
21020,toby,"Good evening, Mr. President."
21021,bartlet,"Hey, Toby. You want a drink?"
21022,toby,"No, thank you, sir. I'm fine."
21027,bartlet,"You know what I just found out recently? To be called ""bourbon,"" it has to come from  Kentucky. Otherwise it’s called sour mash. An Algerian-born terrorist named Reda Nessam  was arrested at the Canadian border yesterday with a U-Haul containing ten 2-ounce jars  filled with nitroglycerin."
21028,toby,And they don’t allow that kind of thing at Yosemite?
21029,bartlet,"No. Anyway, on advice from State and Intelligence, I closed the embassies in Tanzania  and Brussels."
21031,bartlet,"They want me to order the airports, heighten security, but it’s a holiday weekend.  I don’t know. Toby, I got to tell you something..."
21032,toby,Does the FAA have to present evidence of a credible theory?
21035,bartlet,I don’t know. They do it...
21036,toby,"Is there... excuse me, sir. Is there a time frame?"
21037,bartlet,"About an hour. Toby, around ten years ago, for a period of a few months, I was feeling  run down and I had a pain in my leg. They both eventually subsided, but then eight  years ago, the pain came back, as well as numbness. My vision would be blurry sometimes  and I’d get dizzy. During an eye exam, the doctor detected abnormal pupil responses  and ordered an MRI. The radiologist found plaque on my brain and spine. I have a  relapsing-remitting course of MS."
21039,bartlet,"I have Multiple Sclerosis, Toby."
21040,toby,"What does ""relapsing-remitting"" mean?"
21042,toby,"What does ""relapsing-remitting"" mean?"
21043,bartlet,It's... I don't know... it's the good kind of MS.
21045,bartlet,"Yeah, as opposed to secondary progressive."
21047,bartlet,Yeah. MS is a chronic disease of the central nervous system. Symptoms can be as mild as  numbness or as severe as paralysis.
21052,toby,"Is it... I'm sorry, is it fatal?"
21053,bartlet,No. That's the good news. The bad news is there's no cure.
21054,toby,"Yeah, that I knew.  Does relapsing..."
21055,bartlet,Ever turn into secondary progressive?
21058,toby,Is there any way of telling if it's going to?
21061,toby, I'd like to stand up. Can I stand?
21063,toby,"I'm sorry, sir, uh... I need to... Can I, uh... Excuse me."
21070,josh,"No, they didn't.  What are you doing?"
21072,josh,You think the President's gonna get heckled?
21074,josh,"Okay, here we go. ""Ladies and Gentlemen, I am very happy to be here. And I want to thank  the White House Correspondents Association for inviting me. I expect I'll be stuck here  tonight with my fair share of verbal harpoons. I don't mind, just don't stick me...   with... the... dinner check."" Wow."
21076,josh,"Yeah, well, unless we give that instruction to the audience I don't think it's going to  be a problem."
21078,josh,"""I don't mind, just don't stick me with the dinner check?"""
21082,josh,We're not gonna need a dead audience joke.
21083,josh,I did. Me. Those are from me.
21087,josh,Donna doesn't like to talk about it.
21102,toby,I thought it was the flu.
21104,toby,"How is it possible? How is it possible that this was kept a secret? First of all, who  else knows?"
21110,toby,It's not entirely your business?
21114,toby,He took a physical. Those doctors were from eight years ago. He took a physical...
21120,toby,Nobody lied? Is that what you've been saying to yourself over and over again...
21122,toby,"...for a year, Leo? A deception of massive proportion? I can't even... He gets a  physical twice a year at Bethesda. His doctors are Naval officers. Are you telling me  that officers are involved in this?"
21124,toby,These guys are going to be court-martialed.
21128,toby,"Officers. The First Lady. Surgeons... Surgeon generals, for all I know..."
21129,bartlet," The plural of surgeon general isn't surgeon generals, it's surgeons general.  Like attorneys general, or courts martial. Nobody was asked to lie. That was Garreth from  the FAA. Upon interrogating Reda Nessam, they believe it's possible that another rental  car crossed the border yesterday. They believe it's headed to a safe house in Patterson,  New Jersey, and the FBI thinks they can apprehend him in 24 hours. Of course, the only  way all of this will happen is if Reda Nessam is telling the truth, so who wants odds?  Anyway, they're still looking at forensic evidence and we're going to talk again in a  few minutes to decide if there's a credible threat."
21130,toby,"I'm sorry, sir, I didn't hear that."
21131,bartlet,"I said, we're going to decide if there's a credible threat. Why? What are you guys  talking about?"
21133,josh,You have any idea how much longer Toby’s gonna be?
21134,josh,  I’m sorry the Speaker isn’t here. He’s up on the Hill in last minute negotiations.  He’s going over his prenup and he wants a line-item veto.
21137,josh, Where’s Mrs. Bartlet gonna be?
21138,josh, She’s not coming to the Correspondents' Dinner?
21139,josh," Charlie, what’s going on?"
21140,josh,Sorry.  You don’t know when Toby’s out?
21142,josh, All right... Here we go!
21146,josh,When did that come back?
21149,josh, Why are we talking about the ERA?
21151,josh,"Yeah, but it's not back or anything though, is it? "
21155,josh,"Alright, here’s a joke based on the premise that the party afterwards is hard to get  into and that the President is the Commander-In-Chief. ""I hear the Bloomberg party is  gonna be hard to get into this year but I’m not worried. I’m going to the party with  the 82nd Airborne."""
21157,josh,"Or ""Wow, I haven’t seen my staff update their resumes this quickly since the last time  I tanked at the Correspondents' Dinner!"" "
21161,josh,"Hey, who gave you those flowers on your desk?"
21165,josh,"Yeah, cut the Speaker joke, okay? Mrs. Bartlet might not be there."
21167,josh,"Alright, so uh... we’re gonna be fine here."
21170,toby,Leo said you had an attack last year?
21172,toby,Leo said you had an attack last year. 
21174,toby,A couple of nights before the State of the Union.
21176,toby,Wasn’t that also the night you saw satellite pictures of India moving on Kashmir?
21178,toby,India and Pakistan were staring each other down. Control of some nuclear weapons had  been put in the field.
21180,toby,"So, in the middle of a... I don’t know what you call them..."
21182,toby,...You were in the Situation Room as Commander-In-Chief.
21183,bartlet, I know. I can’t believe we’re all still here.
21185,bartlet,The episode was over. Leo was with me. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs was with me as  were the Secretaries of State and Defense. 
21186,toby,Do you receive medication?
21188,toby,Do you receive medication?
21189,bartlet,I get injections of Betaseron.
21192,toby,"None of your current doctors are aware of your condition... Mr. President, is your wife  medicating you?"
21193,bartlet,I think it would be best while temperatures are running a little high that you refer to my  wife as Mrs. Bartlet or the First Lady.
21199,bartlet,Talk me through what heightened security means.
21203,bartlet,"Okay, they want a few minutes?"
21205,bartlet, Toby’s concerned that the peaceful solution I brokered in Kashmir last year  was the result of a drug-induced haze.
21207,toby,"Well, that’s fantastic."
21209,toby,None of you were elected!
21210,bartlet,"I was elected, they were appointed.  The Vice President was elected.  He has the constitutional authority to assume my..."
21211,toby,Not last May he didn’t.  He didn’t last May when you were under general anesthesia.
21212,bartlet,"That’s because I never signed the letter, but I don’t think I got shot because I got MS."
21213,toby,"I don’t think you did either, sir. I meant that during a night of extreme chaos and fear,  when we didn’t yet know if we’d been the victims of domestic or-or foreign terrorism or  even an act of war there was uncertainty as to who was giving the National Security  orders and that was because you never signed a letter! "
21214,toby,"So I'm led to wonder, given your condition and it’s lack of predictability why there  isn’t simply a signed letter sitting in a file someplace? And the answer, of course, is  that...  if there was a-a signed letter sitting in a file someplace, somebody  would ask why. "
21215,toby," And twelve hours earlier an F-117 was shot down in the no fly,  and the Vice President’s authority was murky at best! "
21216,toby,The National Security Advisor and Secretary of State didn’t know who they were taking  their orders from! I wasn’t in the Situation Room that night but I’ll bet all the money  in my pockets against all the money in your pockets that it was Leo... who no one elected!  For 90 minutes that night there was a coup d’etat in this country. 
21217,bartlet,And the walls came tumbling down. I feel fine by the way. Thanks for asking.
21219,bartlet," No, Leo. Toby’s concern for my health is moving me in ways..."
21222,bartlet, You know your indignation would be a lot more interesting to me if it  weren’t quite so covered in crap! 
21225,bartlet, Are you pissed because I didn’t say anything or are you pissed because there  were 15 people who knew before you did? I feel fine by the way. Thanks for asking.
21228,bartlet," Yeah, this is the President."
21238,josh,Ow! What the hell? That was him!
21240,josh,"Well, in fairness, I think everybody should have a turn. Sam, is there anything we can  pull, anything funny we can recycle?"
21242,josh,"That one was a barn-burner, was it?"
21264,toby,Hoynes is one of the 16?
21266,toby,And he thinks the President won’t run again?
21270,toby,Where’s the First Lady?
21272,toby,Why’d she come to me after the State of the Union?
21274,toby,Why’s she mad at the President? It’s because the State of the Union set up the  re-election run and somehow she’s under the impression that’s not supposed to happen.
21276,toby,I have no kind of investigative mind. Zero. It took me six days and 23 minutes to  figure it out.
21278,toby,"Yeah, yeah ‘cause we stood in that office a couple of months ago, you and I, and you  said, ""Take my hand,"" and we just..."
21281,toby,Hoynes was fourteen. Who was fifteen?
21283,toby,"I’m sorry, Leo, but I need you to look at me right now and tell me the doctor’s not  under some kind of surveillance."
21285,toby,"Well, I’m sure we’re gonna find that out soon enough."
21289,toby,"Leo, Hoynes left bread crumbs. He wanted me to find out. A camping trip to Killington?"
21291,toby,I don’t think it was. I think he may be the only one around here who’s acting responsibly.
21293,toby,"The Democratic Party. Seven and a half months to the Iowa caucus, and no one's been told  the President might not be the nominee!"
21295,toby,"No, he may not have that option, Leo."
21297,toby," Well, I suppose one of five things.  The President can decide not to run. He can run and not win. He can run and win."
21301,toby,There’s gonna be hearing upon hearing upon hearing.
21304,toby,Says you.  You don't have to break the law to get served with articles of  impeachment.
21306,toby, Write down the exact date and time you said that.
21321,josh,"Well, that was predictable."
21323,josh,I’m trying to find that speech Sam said.
21325,josh,"Well, yeah, sure, I suppose."
21331,josh,What the hell is happening now?
21333,josh,"Hey, I’m just grateful we were your last choice."
21335,josh,"Donna, if you’ve got your old Catholic-school uniform on under there, don’t get me  wrong, I applaud the thought, but..."
21341,josh,Yeah. You know why? ‘Cause you didn’t put down the kitty litter.
21343,josh,You were in a car accident?
21345,josh,"Seriously, you were in an accident?"
21347,josh,You told me it was a late thaw.
21349,josh, He stopped on the way to the hospital for a beer?
21355,josh,I’m not gonna make fun of him.
21357,josh,But just what kind of a dumbkes were you...
21362,josh,"I’m just sayin’ if you were in an accident, I wouldn’t stop for a beer."
21364,toby,Why not heighten security?
21366,toby,At the airports. Why not heighten security? What’s the downside?
21369,bartlet,Charlie!  I’ve got to make the call.
21370,bartlet,Let’s get Garreth back.
21372,bartlet,The scanners they use take an hour to search the luggage of 250 passengers. The condition  requires two photo IDs. Most people only have one. Delays. Delays are the downside.
21376,bartlet," I have no intention of apologizing to you, Toby."
21377,toby,Would you mind if I ask why not?
21378,bartlet,"‘Cause you’re not the one with MS, a wife, three kids and airports to close. Not every  part of me belongs to you. This was personal. I’m not willing to relinquish that right."
21379,toby,"It will appear to many, if not most, as fraud. It will appear as if you denied the voters  an opportunity to decide for themselves. They’re generally not willing to relinquish that  right, either."
21381,toby,"Mr. President, at some point in the near future, we’re going to have to speak to some  lawyers."
21382,bartlet,"Well, that’s what usually brings on the episodes, but if you say so."
21383,toby," It's 17 people, by the way."
21385,toby,You knew. We weren’t counting you. It’s 17 people.
21386,bartlet,I don’t know.  It may have been unbelievably stupid. It may have  been unthinkably stupid. I don’t know. 
21387,bartlet,I’m sorry. I really am.
21388,toby,I’ve gotta go in the other room and uh...
21389,bartlet,Yeah. I’ll see you tomorrow. Thanks.
21390,toby,"Thank you, Mr. President."
21392,bartlet,"I couldn't disagree more, Cal. As long as these people are funding their public school  districts with property taxes, neither the value of the schools nor the value of their  property is going to go up. It's a vicious circle. It's terrible and it has to be stopped. "
21393,bartlet,I wouldn't go that far. Anything else? 
21396,bartlet,"It's a vicious circle, Leo. "
21400,bartlet,It just goes round and round... 
21402,bartlet,...and round and round. 
21406,bartlet,We really need to see him now? 
21410,bartlet,"Five White House Counsels in two and a half years. Cochran, Gates, Solomon, Tribbey.  Why can't I keep a head lawyer around here? "
21412,bartlet,I don't like new people. 
21414,bartlet,"Never played chess, though, have we? "
21420,bartlet,"What is it with people from Chicago that they're so happy to have been born there?  I meet so many people who can't wait to tell me they're from Chicago, and when I  meet them, they're living anywhere but Chicago. "
21422,bartlet,He looks down his nose at me 'cause I'm not a lawyer. 
21424,bartlet,I didn't go to law school. I got a Ph.D. in economics instead. 
21426,bartlet,"Yeah, and all that happened was I won a Nobel Prize and got elected President so I guess  that decision didn't really pay off. "
21428,bartlet,Should I run back and get my Nobel Prize? 
21430,bartlet,Guy's been here three months he's got a nicer office than I do. 
21432,bartlet,That matters less to me. 
21434,bartlet,What are the bags for? 
21435,bartlet,"Oh... oh, gosh. Oliver, this... "
21439,bartlet,The man's bags are packed. Where are you going? 
21440,bartlet,Asia's best-kept secret. 
21441,bartlet,It's really not even... I don't want you to worry that much about it. 
21445,bartlet,"Well, Oliver, it really boils down to this I'm going to tell you a story and then  I need you to tell me whether or not I've engaged 16 people in a massive criminal  conspiracy to defraud the public in order to win a Presidential election. "
21446,josh,"Finance, Foreign Relations, Senate Banking, I guess. Leo's in a meeting. Someone's going  to call you every half-hour. Yeah. "
21448,josh,"Yeah, can you believe it? "
21450,josh,"No, actually just this morning. "
21452,josh,By noT slowly devaluing the peso the way I told them to. 
21454,josh,"The Treasury Secretary did, but I was in the room. "
21456,josh,"Seriously, they're in big trouble. Three weeks ago, they fell to 20 cents against the  dollar. Two weeks ago, the Bolsa Index took its worst single day fall in history and  this morning the Mexican market opened 20 percent off THE Friday close. "
21458,josh,It'd be like a 2000 point drop in the Dow. The immediate problem... 
21459,josh,"I saw it two hours ago, Toby. Where you been? "
21461,josh,We could be screwed on vouchers. 
21462,toby,"We are screwed on vouchers, but I want to know... "
21464,toby,Somebody's going to eat this quote! 
21466,josh,"Yeah, I can't worry about it right now. "
21468,josh,"Mexico's got 30 billion dollars worth of foreign loans due this week, and they don't  have 30 billion dollars. "
21470,josh," Oh-oh, the Wells Fargo wagon is a'coming down the street. "
21471,josh,"Buenos dias, señores y señoras. "
21472,josh,Let's find some money. 
21473,c.j.,"I've seen it, obviously. I just haven't spoken to the President about it. "
21474,c.j.,The President hasn't turned around. 
21475,c.j.,"It sounds like the senior White House official would be willing to compromise, but I  haven't spoken to the President yet this morning. If I could move off the quote for a  moment. This is from the Coast Guard Marine Safety and Environmental Protection Division.  About three hours ago a single-hull VLCC carrying four million gallons of crude oil ran  up on a shoal three miles south of Rahobeth Beach, Delaware. "
21476,c.j.,"Whoa, whoa, I don't have much. I'm going to give you everything I've got. The hull was  punctured and the tanker is leaking oil. "
21477,c.j.,"200,000 gallons so far. "
21478,c.j.,"The Coast Guard has deployed containment booms around the vessel, and they're siphoning  oil... "
21483,c.j.,The Federal on-scene coordinator scheduled a press conference for 2:00 this afternoon  from the Coast Guard Incident Command Post. We hope to have much more information by  then. 
21486,c.j.,Anything good in the paper this morning? 
21487,toby,Who's the senior White House official? 
21489,toby,Are you telling me you can't can't control...  A reporter can just  pick up the phone and call anyone? 
21492,c.j.,'Cause we don't live in Tripoli. 
21493,toby,"The Republican leaders are already think... Shallick, Ann Stark, they already think they  can get the votes on a compromised measure. "
21495,toby," All they were scared of was a veto. They're going to build it  now. They're going to do it. And our phones, all day long, are going to be ringing with  Democrats who want us dead. Seth Gillette's going to... Let me tell you something --  this time, he's going to be right! "
21496,c.j.,"Toby, I'll talk to Leo and Josh. I'll talk to the President. I'll get a clarification.  Beyond that, what do you want me to do? "
21497,toby,I want you to find out who the senior White House official was and  put his ass  in my office by the end of the day! 
21499,c.j.,I imagine if it was anyone within the sound of Toby's voice they'd be looking for a  trapdoor right now. 
21501,c.j.,Carol's going to give you the notes from the Coast Guard. 
21503,c.j.,"Well, all that's being investigated, but I'm assuming that when a ship runs into the  shore it has something to do with either the navigation or the steering. "
21505,c.j.,"Hey Sam... you don't know who it was, right? "
21507,bartlet,Not as much as a doctor. You should talk to a doctor. 
21508,bartlet,"I think what you're asking is, is it possible I could be sitting in the Situation Room,  have an attack, and nobody knows it. "
21509,bartlet,Yes. My vision might get blurry. You wouldn't know that. My legs might get numb...
21511,bartlet, What's he talking about? 
21513,bartlet,I don't want to be careful about what I say in this room. 
21514,bartlet,"I want you. I meant, I don't need to be careful. "
21516,bartlet,Have I ever been party to a lawsuit? 
21517,bartlet,I was governor of New Hampshire. Anybody who... 
21518,bartlet, A meter reader slipped on a patch of black ice in my driveway and I got  dragged into some pain-in-the-ass thing over my great-aunt's will. 
21520,bartlet,"Oliver, why are we talking about my great-aunt's will and the meter reader? "
21531,bartlet,"Well, the Mexican economy crashed, an oil tanker busted up about 120 miles from here and  13 percent of Americans are living in poverty. So yeah, I can hang out with you and  answer insulting questions for awhile. "
21532,josh,Treasury's getting it into legislative language right now. The Assistant Secretary for  Legislative Affairs... 
21533,josh,Yes. Says she'll have it for us in an hour to review it. That's when the President's  going to call you and ask you to fast track it. He wants you to take it straight to  mark-up and vote. 
21534,josh,"We understand, but we don't have a day. "
21535,josh,"Yeah, listen. Uh, the next story in the news cycle has got to be that the U.S. is  guaranteeing the loans. "
21536,josh,The President doesn't mind staying up late to sign his name. 
21538,josh,Not at all. You mind talking fast? 
21539,josh,Shout to somebody if you need coffee. 
21540,c.j.,How's it going in there? 
21541,josh,The number of people whose permission I need before I can do whatever the hell I want...  Let me tell you something. There's really a lot to be said for fascism. 
21542,c.j.,Funny you should mention that. 
21544,c.j.,He wants me to find the leak. 
21546,c.j.,No problem. Was it you? 
21548,c.j.,"Okay. Well, then, now I'm stumped. "
21549,c.j.,"Josh, when there's a leak, I do what I do. Finding the person is usually impossible  under benign circumstances but with Toby blasting around the halls whoever it was has  gone so far underground we could start our search in Beijing. "
21550,josh,What about asking Cashin? 
21551,c.j.,Cashin isn't going to roll over on a source. 
21552,josh,Then you've got to get a swinging light bulb in there and just do it. 
21553,c.j.,"Yeah, this from the guy who had four kinds of aneurysms when he had to interrogate the  staff on drug use. "
21554,josh,That was a lot different. 
21556,josh,"No, because that was an investigation into personal behavior. This guy compromised a  policy initiative. "
21557,c.j.,"That's a fair point, and I'm not saying it's not bad I'm just saying I'm not going to  find him. "
21558,josh,You're absolutely not going to find him.
21559,c.j.,But I should spend the day doing it anyway. 
21561,c.j.,Because Toby's pissed. 
21562,josh,"Hey, you know what? I've found that if you accept that as a good enough reason for  doing something, life becomes easier. "
21563,c.j.,Thank you for the fortune cookie wisdom. 
21566,josh,"You just lurk there in the shadows, like... "
21570,josh,Can you do them later? 
21572,josh,So you're not doing them now? 
21576,josh,Can you ask them later? 
21578,josh,"Okay, it's going to be one of these now, right? "
21580,josh,You object to the bailout? 
21582,josh,Because in the world of Donnatella Moss we should all love one another just as long  as it doesn't cost you anything. 
21620,bartlet,"I have accidental death insurance as well as considerable personal worth. Were I to die,  my family would not miss my government salary. "
21621,bartlet,I don't have any anymore. 
21622,bartlet,"I'm the husband of a doctor and as a Governor and President, the various governments  I've led generously... "
21628,c.j.,"Hey, Jamie, how are you doing? "
21630,c.j.,"Yes, and I'd like to ask you some questions. "
21631,c.j.,There was a meeting about vouchers in the Roosevelt Room last Thursday. Were you part  of it?
21632,c.j.,"Right, and have you talked to Terry Cashin of the Baltimore Sun in the last four days? "
21633,c.j.,"I was wondering, if in the last four days... "
21634,c.j.,I was going to be a little more circumspect. 
21636,c.j.,And frankly -- and I don't say this to you enough -- doing a very good job. 
21637,c.j.,Do you happen to know who the leak is? 
21638,c.j.,"No, no, we wrapped that up tight. "
21640,c.j.,How many more of these do I have? 
21641,c.j.,"Okay, after five of them, I'm just going to confess. "
21643,josh,They're not done meeting yet? 
21653,josh,Does he want me to call back? 
21655,josh,"No, why don't you call him back? Why don't you call him back and remind him that the  Mexican consumers who buy his textiles can't afford to buy them anymore. Frank will be  laid off. Which isn't a problem there are plenty of jobs out there for a 48-year-old  textiles worker just as long as he's trained in high-tech computers and/or medical  research. "
21657,josh,"Eventually it does. And we're not giving them the money, we're giving them our credit  card and paying the bill. It's a loan. We did the same thing six years ago -- the loan  was paid back ahead of schedule. "
21663,josh,"Well, not right here in front of everybody, Donna, but if you want to run home and get  your equipment... "
21665,josh,"The telemarketing was a nice detail but you should've said, ""scrubbed floors."" "
21713,c.j.,"And Josh was in the Roosevelt Room meeting last Thursday, right? "
21715,c.j.,And do you recall him talking to you about what went on? 
21719,c.j.,'Cause somebody might've overheard you talking to him. 
21723,c.j.,"And... and you yourself didn't talk to anybody, did you? "
21728,c.j.,Are you saying it was you? 
21734,c.j., What are you talking about? 
21749,josh,You got a phone call while you were in there. 
21753,josh,"Yeah, I jotted it down. Apparently they're at war, but we've taken a firm stand as an  isolationist nation and refused to get involved. Our resources are our own and their  problems are on the other side of the world. Though, they do have problems. It sounds  to me from what they said on the phone that France, Austria, and England are getting  absolutely pounded by the Germans, and with no end in sight. They say that by 1941  they're gonna desperately need our help if they have any chance of survival. But I think  they're just being hysterical. This son of a customs agent with the Charlie Chaplin  mustache ain't going anywhere. But there's no telling that to Franklin Roosevelt, who's  trying to convince his country they need to get involved. That's why he came up with this. "
21755,josh,Turn to the page I flagged. 
21757,josh,"Yeah. Simply put, a loan of arms to Russia and Britain, with the understanding that  they'd pay us back when the war was over. And he said this, he said, ""If your neighbor's  house is on fire, you don't haggle over the price of your garden hose."" Frank Kelly in  South Carolina wouldn't... There are too many things in the world we can't do. Mexico's  on fire. Why help them? Because we can. "
21764,c.j.,You're the first one who's understood that. 
21766,c.j.,"All right, that's it!  "
21771,toby,"Yeah... No. I'm sorry, no."
21772,c.j.,"Excuse me, Sam, would you mind? "
21774,c.j.,"It's me, okay? I am Spartacus. "
21776,c.j.,"It was a leak. Leaks happen. They've happened since the beginning of time. In this  White House, in every White House. There's no malicious intent. Things get out.  It's a company town. Everybody talks to everybody, and junior staffers try to impress  reporters by showing they're in the know. There is no group of people this large in  the world that can keep a secret. I find it comforting. It's how I know for sure the  government isn't covering up aliens in New Mexico.  Toby, I've issued a blanket  email to 1,100 staffers about the incident. I've asked the President to let me make a  clarification for tomorrow morning. I've seen to it it'll be on page one. We're not  gonna lose an inch of ground in the negotiation. "
21778,c.j.,"No, we're not. And you knew that since this morning. "
21780,c.j.,Yeah. So what's this about? 
21781,toby,"This is small potatoes. I want to know, when the big potatoes come, are we up for it? "
21782,c.j.,"Big potatoes? Toby, we ran for election. We lived through Leo and booze, Sam and  prostitutes, India and Pakistan, Colombia and a failed rescue mission. Are there  bigger potatoes someplace? "
21786,c.j.,Why are you lying to me? 
21789,bartlet,Sit down. Don't be scared. 
21790,bartlet,My youngest daughter's got a big mouth. 
21791,bartlet,"We won't discuss this any more for the time being. It'll be public soon enough. And the  more conversations you have with me, the more lawyers you're gonna have to talk to, and  they bill in an hour what you take home in a week, so we won't discuss it except to say  this. You're gonna be subpoenaed. I'm confident in your loyalty to me. I'm confident in  your love for me. If you lie to protect me, if you lie just once, if you lie just a  little, if you lie 'cause you can't stand what's happening to me and the people making  it happen, if you ever, ever lie... "
21792,bartlet,"...you're finished with me, you understand? "
21795,bartlet, I need you to go to law school and graduate as soon as humanly possible. 
21796,bartlet,"Well, I've got good news for you, Oliver. Turns out I didn't do everything right after  all. Zoey had to fill out a family history form for Georgetown and because she was 17,  a parent had to sign it."
21798,bartlet,"I'd give anything if I had. It was Lady Macbeth.  There's a bad moon rising,  Oliver. We both know it. They're gonna take me out for a walk. "
21799,bartlet,"This isn't what you signed up for. Leo begged you to take this job. This isn't what you  signed up for. If you leave, I'd appreciate it if you did it now, so it doesn't look  like my lawyer bailed on me when the rain starts. No one's gonna hold it against you. "
21801,bartlet,What would my first step be? 
21807,c.j.,I really wasn’t paying that much attention.
21808,c.j.,I walked from my office to your office.
21809,c.j.,"Not at 5:30 in the morning, no."
21810,c.j.,Last night when Leo told me.
21813,c.j., Should I have my lawyer here?
21814,c.j.,You’re the President’s lawyer.
21816,c.j.,When did the President tell you?
21819,c.j.,And Leo he told more than a year ago.
21820,c.j.,"And I’ve had this for six hours now, so maybe giving me some room wouldn’t be totally  out of line. You know what I’m saying, Oliver?"
21822,c.j.,I was told to report to you. I don’t know you. You’ve been here what...?
21823,c.j.,"Three months, so why should I trust you?"
21825,c.j.,"I think this is going really well so far, Oliver. It’s almost hard to believe that four  different women have sued you for divorce. "
21828,c.j.," Well, I have to tell you it’ll be the first time I’ve been asked out  in quite awhile, so..."
21829,c.j., That much has sunk in in the last six hours. 
21831,c.j., What was the question?
21847,toby,"All right, hear me out on this, okay?"
21849,toby,We want to see some polling.
21851,toby,‘Cause we need to know what to do next.
21853,toby,"No, we don’t know which is the more insurmountable problem - the perception that... "
21855,toby, ... the perception that he’s not physically up to the job or that he lied  about it.
21857,josh,"All public opinion’s shaped by the reaction of the press, but the fundamental foundation  already exists in their current perception that the President..."
21863,toby,Josh trusts Joey Lucas.
21865,josh,"Yes, she’s flying in right now."
21867,josh,I told her we were commissioning a poll to explore attitudes towards subsurface  agricultural products.
21869,josh,Underground. We think Americans are eating more beets.
21875,toby,I wouldn’t do it right now.
21877,toby,His head is in the SME speech for Chicago...
21879,toby,Hang on. His head is in Chicago and that’s where we need him. Would you want to write a  speech with this other thing around your neck?
21882,toby,"The end of the day, then."
21887,toby,When does she get here?
21892,josh, I gotta trust somebody right now.
21893,toby,"Good, ‘cause I don’t trust anybody right now. "
21896,josh,What are you telling me for?
21906,josh,Sorry to keep you waiting.
21909,josh,"The fax is for the press office, give it to them."
21911,josh,"Uh, Martin, you can have a seat in my office.  C.J. is meeting with  Babish. I’ll be inside. "
21916,josh, I have a call to return to Mac.
21917,josh,Why don’t you talk to me now?
21920,josh,"Martin, we spent 13 million the first year, 23 million the second... Where’s the money  going?"
21922,josh,Aren’t you allowed to transfer funds...
21924,josh,"Yeah, let me run it by Leo."
21925,josh,You don’t have to convince me.
21927,josh, The... tobacco companies.
21928,josh,"Well, I’m... gonna talk to Leo and I’ll tell Mac you were here."
21929,c.j.,What was that? March of last year?
21930,c.j.,I’d have to go back and check.
21931,c.j.,"If that was March of last year, then that was his fourth physical, then there were a  couple of times during the campaign, and after the shooting..."
21932,c.j.,And the time he rode his bicycle into a tree.
21935,c.j.,"The President’s physician - right now it’s Admiral Leonard Morrow - the President's  physician calls me, gives me a short statement including vitals."
21938,c.j.,"Because of doctor-patient confidentiality, there’s only so much you’re gonna get from the  doctors."
21939,c.j.,"I say, is there anything I should know about your health that the doctors won’t tell me."
21944,c.j.,"I really don’t remember, I don’t. I don’t choose my words that carefully."
21945,c.j.,You think I was speaking to the President in code?
21947,c.j.,The sky is falling down.
21973,c.j.,I was outside the room.
21975,c.j.,The sound of a Stueben glass pitcher crashing to the floor.
21977,c.j.,"Well, at first glance, I thought he might have a virus contracted from a rare African  tsetse fly, possibly tropical sprue. I’m not an expert, but I did meet a man once in  India."
21978,c.j.,It could be anything with these Presidents. James Polk had diverticulitis.
21979,c.j.,"Couldn’t digest nuts. I’ll tell you what else. One in 40 American men wear women’s  clothing, and we’ve had well over forty Presidents."
21980,c.j.,"I’m just sayin’, one of these guys was dancing around the Oval Office in a prom dress.  Now let’s get to the bottom of that."
21984,c.j.,I wasn’t told to say it was the flu. I was told it was the flu.
21985,c.j., I’m not getting into that! I’m not getting into who said what. We can do that  at the next of what I’m sure will be many sessions.
21992,toby,We got good reviews on the commencement speech.
21994,toby,"From Maynard Wachtel, of all places."
21996,toby,He calls you and me the Batman and Robin of speech-writing.
21998,toby,"He doesn’t, but he should, ‘cause that’s what we are."
22000,toby,We’re Batman and Robin!
22002,toby,"Look at me, Sam. Am I Robin?"
22006,toby,"You bet, little friend."
22008,toby,"No, we’ll keep those identities secret. I’m Bruce Wayne, and you’re my ward..."
22018,toby,The projections are lower?
22020,toby,I’m so happy I could spit. 
22022,toby,I favor it when it gives us a bat and ball on tax cuts.
22024,toby,"We offer ‘em a deal. We lower the bottom rate from fifteen to ten percent, but we stand  our ground on no tax cut in the top bracket, and you know why?"
22030,toby,Their private jets are too slow?
22040,toby,I have to go to a meeting. You should talk to somebody at ATJ or the Caucus.
22065,bartlet,"When Leo talked to you on the plane, he thought you already knew."
22067,bartlet,"And I’m saying, we still do this. We’re husband and wife and parents, and before we  launch into palace intrigue, we do, ""Welcome back. How was the flight?"""
22069,bartlet,One of the forms Zoey had to fill out for Georgetown asked for a family medical history.
22071,bartlet,Did Leo tell you the rest?
22073,bartlet,Zoey wasn’t 18 yet when she started. A parent had to sign the form.
22075,bartlet,"No, you did, Hot Pants."
22082,bartlet,I talked to Zoey this morning. She’s gonna ace her finals.
22084,bartlet,I hate Ellie’s boyfriend.
22086,bartlet,"I need you to speak to the White House Counsel, Abbey."
22092,josh,Why hadn’t the President told her yet?
22096,josh,"Martin Connelly, who’s an Assistant Attorney General in the Civil Division, says they’re  out of money."
22100,josh,We don’t give ‘em enough.
22102,josh,"Yeah, but the problem is the law says that those transfers are subject to approval by  various House committees, each of which has a chairman elected with the eight million  dollars Tobacco spent in the last election. And even if the transfers were approved,  it wouldn’t matter, ‘cause twelve million isn’t gonna get it done."
22104,josh,Then let’s give ‘em more.
22108,josh,So you give ‘em enough to win.
22110,josh,They’re saying 30 million and I think it’s a steal at twice the price.
22114,josh,I’m going out to the airport.
22138,josh,What happened to Kenny?
22139,josh, So you’re the substitute interpreter?
22140,josh,"Not exactly. Uh, Dale, I’m gonna ask you to wait over here, okay?... Uh, Joey, you’re  gonna read my lips, and if I can’t understand what you’re saying, you’ll write it down,  all right?"
22143,josh,"Pretty good-looking for an interpreter, wouldn’t you say?"
22145,josh, He’s not a television detective?
22147,josh,You’re not getting in the car.
22148,josh,‘Cause you’re getting back on a plane in an hour and ten minutes.
22149,josh,"All right, if we sit like this, can Dale Bracket, PI, read my lips?"
22150,josh,Okay... You’re not talking to me about an agriculture poll.
22152,josh,"Well, we are, but... that’s not important."
22153,josh,"Uh, cranberry juice and club soda...and, um, I’ll have a large glass of ice water."
22154,josh,"I told Leo McGarry that we could trust you, and Toby backed me up."
22155,josh," Eight years ago, the President was diagnosed with an illness  that was never disclosed."
22193,josh,Probably in about a week.
22194,josh,"We're deciding. Probably a live interview, followed by a press conference. So we need to  know what we're talking about. Joey, we need you to put a poll in the field. You got to  come up with a model that gets us the answers we need without asking the questions we  can't ask. You gotta come up with the model by yourself, you got to break down the  results by yourself. Not even the callers can understand the questions they're asking.  And you got to do it all in 96 hours. Is what I'm describing possible?"
22197,josh,The Governor of an industrial state.
22198,josh,And you give him a degenerative illness.
22199,josh,"Joey, you understand that before this is over we're probably all going to be spending  some time in front of a grand jury."
22204,josh,He's fine. I'll tell him you asked.
22230,c.j.,"Well, I got pretty well bitch-slapped by the White House Counsel, ma'am, how about you?"
22232,c.j., I didn't know what he meant or why he said it.
22234,c.j.,"Babish said there's a difference between asking the President, ""Is there anything else  I *should* know,"" and, ""Is there anything else I *need* to know?"" He seemed to think  ""need to know"" implies I know something already, but I don't want it confirmed in order  to maintain... deniability."
22236,c.j.,I told him I couldn't remember which one I say.
22238,c.j.,"Abbey...  During the campaign, we were in Manhattan, Kansas, at a Sheraton,  or a Marriott, I can't remember, but we were in Manhattan, Kansas... And I came to your  suite early to tell you we'd be doing Nightline that night and we had to get to an ABC  affiliate. And I think by then the two of you were so used to people walking in and out  of your room that you didn't hear me open the door. And I was almost sure I saw you  giving the President an injection of something."
22240,c.j.,"When the President has his physical, and I do the release, I only ever ask, ""Is there  anything else I need to know?"""
22244,josh,"""If the Governor of a major industrial state had a degenerative illness which he hadn't  disclosed during the election but which has yet to impair his job performance, would you  still support him?"""
22248,josh,"Yeah.  Listen, about this Justice appropriation..."
22252,josh,"Yeah.  I just brought it up because this Assistant A.G., Martin Connelly, when  he left my office this morning he turned and said, ""They perpetrated a fraud against  the public."" And the look on his face when he said it... They want to get these people."
22258,bartlet,"Leo, how could you tell Abbey about the health form before I did?"
22260,bartlet,"My wife and I are fighting battles on several fronts at the moment, including one with  each other. Can you and I be men? Can we have a bond?"
22266,bartlet,How's he gonna feel about that?
22270,bartlet,"I'm coming clean, I'm doing it voluntarily. Anyone finds out, it's going to look like  I did it because a poll told me to."
22272,bartlet, Why don't you get Sam?
22280,toby,And you think you may have offended them?
22284,toby,That's all you need to tell me. I trust you.
22291,toby,I'll be here in the office when you're done.
22296,josh,I met with Joey Lucas today.
22298,josh,So now the President's got Leo worried it's going to look like we announced it because  we took a poll.  What do you think?
22300,c.j., The President and Leo are worried about that?
22302,c.j.,"You guys are like Butch and Sundance peering over the edge of a cliff to the  boulder-filled rapids 300 feet below, thinking you better not jump 'cause there's  a chance you might drown. The President has this disease and has been lying about  it, and you guys are worried that the polling might make us look bad? It's the fall  that's gonna kill ya!"
22305,josh,"You said, ""It's the fall that's gonna kill you."" You meant, ""us."""
22306,josh,"Where are you going, C.J.?"
22309,c.j.,I know what you meant. I want to sleep for a while. I'm going home.
22310,josh,"You know, uh, Donna got hold of this fax that was sent to the press office from the  OSF at NASA."
22311,c.j.,"What, something falling out of the sky?"
22313,c.j.,We get that fax once a week.
22314,josh,"Yeah, but Donna doesn't know that. She thinks it's an emergency."
22315,c.j.,And you didn't want to tell her?
22316,josh,"No, 'cause the other way you get a day's worth of entertainment without leaving the  office. She doesn't know that these things fall out of the sky all the time... once  every ten days, as a matter of fact. Since the first year we started putting man-made  objects in space, 17,000 have come back and remarkably, not one person has been hit.   So I suppose there's an argument to be made that we're due."
22317,c.j.,"Yeah. You picked me right up there, Josh."
22319,bartlet,He talked to her on the phone?
22321,bartlet,But he called her on the phone?
22323,bartlet,"Yeah, but I'm saying, did she hang up the phone, turn to her friends and say, 'You're  never gonna believe why I'm getting on a plane?'"
22333,bartlet,You like the way it looks if we're meeting in the basement?
22345,toby,"Joey, your flight was all right? "
22350,josh,Is there anything in there that we're gonna like?
22353,josh,"Mr. President, you remember Joey Lucas?"
22355,josh,And her interpreter Kenny?
22358,bartlet,Excuse me. How many people in this room know Kenny's last name? 
22360,bartlet,I believe this operation is no longer covert.
22366,bartlet,"Joey, is there any good news in there at all?"
22370,bartlet, What happened last night?
22373,bartlet,Where is the president-elect?
22375,bartlet,And that's not the most troubling...
22380,bartlet,"At the moment, there is no Dessaline government; there is no Dessaline! And I just got  done pulling nine dead bodies out of Colombia. Evacuate the non-essentials. Get some  Marines at the Embassy. And somebody brief Fitzwallace!"
22385,c.j.,He needs to be with the First Lady.
22387,c.j.,"Sam, he's gonna go on T.V. and say he lied, I don't want him doing it behind the Seal  of the President."
22389,c.j.,We'll do a 30-minute live special from one of the news magazines.
22390,josh,"Live, live to tape or tape?"
22391,c.j.,"Live, I don't want a producer editing what he says."
22392,josh,What if we want to edit what he says?
22398,c.j.," 'Cause Thursday night is when they pay their bills, and it's going to be  tough enough getting 30 minutes and not telling them why we're not cutting into their  bread and butter during May sweeps."
22401,toby,"All right. 30 minutes, Dateline special Wednesday night, night after tomorrow, the  President and the First Lady in the Mural Room."
22402,c.j.,And we follow that with a press conference.
22404,c.j.,"To control the story as long as possible. Once he gets started with Russert or Diane  or Stone Phillips or whoever the hell does this, I'm gonna need every reporter in the  Western Hemisphere in the room where I can see him."
22405,toby,We put a team of medical experts up there.
22406,c.j.,We have 48 hours to find them.
22408,c.j.," A smart reporter... Sam, Ted Baxter is gonna ask, 'Mr President, are  you planning on seeking reelection?"""
22412,josh,"It's an old stereotype, Mrs. L. Did you get the extended service warranty?"
22414,josh,I got a message Leo wanted to see me.
22415,josh,Did you get the tow package?
22419,josh,"Leo, calm down. I'm right here."
22428,josh,"The Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, State, and the Judiciary."
22434,josh," We'll have an answer on it by the end of the day.  It's looking like 30 minutes on Dateline and a press conference, but Leo, it's also  looking like any scenario is going to require a firm position from the President on  reelection."
22440,josh,Don't you think it would help if we had a discussion among the...
22441,josh,A discussion among the rest of us...
22447,bartlet,What is Peter Bratt doing down there?
22449,bartlet,In the trunk of his car?
22451,bartlet,Did we evacuate the non-essentials?
22457,toby,Do we put Hoynes up there?
22459,toby,Do we put Hoynes up there?
22461,c.j.,The Vice President's presence underlines the health risks to the President.
22463,c.j.,But it'll also serve to underscore that he anticipated the problem and didn't tell  anybody about it.
22465,c.j.,"And he'll get bombarded with questions about what he did or didn't know, and the press  corps will impanel themselves as a grand jury."
22467,c.j.,"Well fantastic, Sam, I didn't realize it was that simple!"
22468,c.j.,"There's a situation developing in Port-Au-Prince, I have to get ready to brief. "
22469,toby,"Sam, can Josiah Bartlet function as President?"
22473,toby,"And what if they ask Hoynes, 'In the meantime, can Bartlet function as President?'"
22475,toby,"What if he says, 'I'm not a medical expert'?"
22477,josh,"Well don't go anywhere, cause I need you."
22478,josh,"You may be right, but Haiti's actually not what I wanted to talk to you about."
22479,josh,"Yeah, Andy. The president wants to get behind a 30 million dollar appropriations bill  the Justice Department's had in your committee for a few months now. They need the  money to continue the case."
22480,josh,Has the chairman scheduled a vote?
22481,josh,He's not gonna schedule a vote?
22482,josh,How much tobacco money has he taken?
22486,josh,They've got two Democrats?
22487,josh,Warren and Rossitter aren't even from the South.
22488,josh,This is a phenomenally important case. It's historic. It has to be won. And we're  fighting with paper clips and a slingshot.
22493,toby,"Yeah, Donna. Uh, I'm going to tell you something shocking except we don't have time  to be shocked. So I need you to just hear it and go back to work."
22495,toby,"Eight years ago, the President was diagnosed with M.S. He concealed it during the  election, but we're going public Wednesday night with a live network interview and  a press conference. This is what Josh is gonna be working on 24 hours and he's gonna  need your help and he's gonna need you to know, and so I'm telling you..."
22497,toby,"You're the first person on the assistant level to find out. Margaret doesn't know,  Bonnie and Ginger don't know. Donna, Mrs. Landingham doesn't know."
22501,toby,I want to press upon you how important it is that this not be discussed beyond...
22503,c.j., I was looking for Leo.
22504,c.j.,That's usually a good sign.
22513,c.j.,"The U.S.S. Enterprise as well as the amphibious carriers out of Mayport, Florida, are  being dispatched to the region and are expected to be there in 36 hours and aircraft  will be in the combat radius of 300 to 400 miles within 12 hours and you'll get more  details on that when the Pentagon briefs at three."
22515,c.j.,State will brief later in the day. 
22516,c.j.,There is no Bazan government.
22517,c.j.,"You're not taking me there, Mark."
22518,c.j.,"It should be clear that we're talking about two separate issues: one is a democratically- elected president whose people are being denied their leader by an armed militia, the  other is the lives of the Americans in the embassy and the American marines who are  guarding them."
22519,c.j.,How about that? I'll be back in a few hours. 
22522,c.j.,That's what you're saying to me?
22524,c.j.,"Bonnie, thank you. Would you step outside the door, please, and knock if anybody wants  to come in?"
22526,c.j.,The White House Press Corps.
22527,c.j.,I need 30 minutes night after tomorrow.
22529,c.j.,I'm not gonna tell you.
22530,c.j.,Tell him it's your network.
22531,c.j.,"That we need 30 minutes Wednesday night. On Wednesday morning, I'll tell you why. You  pick the interviewer, they'll have 10 hours to prepare."
22532,c.j.,The President and the First Lady.
22535,c.j.,"Paul, I've got to get two other networks and CNN to pick this up live; bad enough it's  gonna be your guy and not theirs, but they'll run an old Petticoat Junction before they  put your network brand on their air."
22538,c.j.,No. The water is exactly at my head.
22539,c.j.,"Paul, we'll start to leak Wednesday morning to soften up the ground a little bit.  Anything leaks before then and I'll take my business across the street."
22540,josh,...because I wasn't aware of any ties to tobacco you have.
22543,josh,"Well... Uh... I'm not a litigator and I don't work at the Justice Department, and  there's a reason why both those things are true... but I wouldn't think it'd be that  hard to prove that the tobacco companies have lied since we already know they did!"
22544,josh,Are you saying that people who start smoking and get addicted to nicotine are too  stupid to live?
22545,josh,"Too stupid to be... Every day, the Justice Department uncovers evidence that cigarette  companies knew far better than the rest of us, that smoking causes death and disease.  To say nothing of the CEOs being the last seven people on earth to discover that  nicotine was addictive."
22546,josh,"It's almost three o'clock. By seven, 3000 new people will have taken up smoking; 2800  of them will be under 18. "
22583,bartlet,They boarded the plane?
22588,bartlet,That wasn't supposed to happen!
22590,bartlet,I evacuated the non-essentials specifically so that wouldn't happen!
22592,bartlet,I gave the order six hours ago!
22594,bartlet, Six hours ago I gave the order! What the hell were they still doing  on the runway?!
22600,bartlet,And I'm sure these guys had their handbooks with them!
22602,bartlet,The plane is up in the air?
22604,bartlet,What's happening on the ground?
22608,bartlet,And what does Bazan want?
22614,bartlet,"You're right, you know, I should be bringing them in on reelection. I should be talking  to them."
22616,bartlet,I don't want to make the same mistakes over again.
22618,bartlet,Yeah. Let's start tonight. Around nine o'clock we'll meet in the residence.
22621,bartlet,Never... You bought a new car?
22622,bartlet,And you paid sticker price.
22623,bartlet,"You need to look at the next page - subsection B, paragraph four, Mamie Yokum."
22624,bartlet,Secret Service'd have you down like a calf at a rodeo.
22625,bartlet," ""The definition of 'gift' excludes opportunities and benefits including favorable  rates and commercial discounts available to the public at large."""
22627,bartlet, Is the reason you didn't tell me you were getting a new car... you...?  Did you think I was gonna think it was an extravagance?
22628,bartlet,"You don't think I think you should have a new car?  Delores, have you ever had  a new car?"
22629,bartlet,How about you let me find out what you were supposed to pay and write you a check for  the difference?
22632,bartlet,It's the smell of freedom... and the chemicals they treat the dashboard with.
22633,bartlet,When are you picking it up?
22634,bartlet,"Do me a favor, would you? Come back here after you pick it up. I'd like to talk to you  about something."
22635,bartlet,And put the car in the driveway. I'd like to kick the tires.
22636,bartlet," It's an expression, Fannie Mae! Go get your car!"
22671,josh, I didn't even see you there.
22673,josh,"I've been with...  ...you know, tobacco."
22677,josh," I'll... tell you what that is. That's the Blue Ribbon  Commission on Reform. Let me tell you, I'm gonna be collecting benefits or, you know,  not by the time we get this Blue Ribbon thing up."
22685,josh,C.J. putting the lid on?
22688,c.j.,"The OAS has agreed to meet in an emergency session tomorrow morning, but we're still  waiting for confirmation."
22689,c.j.,"Yes, but first we're gonna say it to them."
22690,c.j.,"Sorry, Mark. We've run out of time, but we'll pick it up with our lightning round  tomorrow. I'm calling a full lid. Any developments throughout the night and you'll  be paged. Thank you for your patience, everybody."
22692,toby,"Leo. This is insane, plain and simple."
22694,toby,You don't think it's crazy?
22696,toby,We're firming up strategy on what will define the future of this presidency and we don't  know if this President is interested in the future. We have to have a discussion and we  have to have it tonight.
22703,josh,"Leo, would you excuse us for a second? Toby, can I talk to you outside?"
22709,toby,"If everybody out there takes it the way she did, we may be okay. If a few more people  in here took it the way she did, that'd be all right, too."
22713,josh,"Kalmbach's not gonna let it come to a vote in the subcommittee, which at the moment  is fine, 'cause if he did, it'd be 8-7 against."
22715,josh, No... We have Stacy and Miner but Warren and Rossitter are voting  against. They have ideological problems with the case... What do you wanna do now?
22717,josh,"Yeah, the problem is, Rossitter sits on the Judiciary Committee and I don't know how  many enemies on Judiciary we wanna make right now."
22719,toby, When did we decide this?
22721,c.j.,30 minutes Wednesday night. Live.
22725,c.j.,"Yeah. They pick the interviewer, it's carried on all the networks and CNN. I give it to  them ten hours before."
22726,toby,And that's followed by a press conference.
22727,c.j.,"There isn't another step we can take until we know what the President's intentions are.  We need a discussion, and I hate to sound shrill, but it can't wait another night."
22728,toby,We're having a discussion.
22750,josh,How about I have C.J. make a statement at her briefing?
22752,josh,"""The President calls on Congress to fund the Justice Department's tobacco lawsuit at the  levels necessary to continue this litigation."""
22754,josh," ""And this Administration won't sit on the bench while well-fed members of  the Appropriations Committee choke off funding for a lawsuit aimed at the perpetrators of  hundreds of thousands of negligent homicides while filling their campaign war chests."""
22766,toby,"He'll sit here, with the First Lady on his right."
22767,toby,"The fireplace is too much. He'll sit here, which means they're gonna have to light the  room from the outside the window. Do they know that?"
22768,toby,The last time they didn't know. The President taped an Easter message that looked like  it was lit by Ed Wood!
22770,toby,"A pitcher of water, but keep it off-screen."
22772,toby,"They gotta light from outside the window, if they don't light from outside the window..."
22776,toby,"C.J. gave it to the network. We're pretty much locked in, so..."
22780,toby,We'll have the afternoon.
22782,toby," There aren't any options left. We're going on T.V., at eight."
22786,toby, We've got her funeral today. We've got these...
22789,c.j.," AP, Reuters, Agence France, something about seating on  Air Force One..."
22790,c.j., Seating arrangements on Air Force One.
22791,c.j.,"Listen, I was thinking since it's probably going to be a light day, I'd maybe blow off  work, go shopping or something. What do you need?"
22792,josh,Can I give you a quick brief?
22794,josh,The Justice Department's run out of money in their suit against the tobacco companies. 
22795,c.j.,The Justice Department's overmatched.
22796,josh,"Yeah, by hundreds of millions of dollars. They're asking for $30 million and we think  they should have it."
22798,josh,"Eight of the fifteen members of the subcommittee that controls the budgets for Justice  and Commerce, including Kalmbach, who has significant ties to tobacco, and Warren and  Rossitter, who do not."
22800,josh,They have ideological objections.
22801,c.j.,"Yeah, it's just not a good time to be losing Democrats."
22802,josh,You haven't been in my office this morning.
22804,josh,"Anyway, uh, Leo felt pretty strongly that we should light a fire under it, so I wrote  up a pretty strongly worded release."
22805,c.j., This is like the fire  we used to throw in the early primaries.
22806,josh, Let Bartlet be Bartlet.
22807,c.j.,You got to put it away for a while.
22809,c.j.,"I'm going in there now to tell them a landing ship helicopter assault team is steaming  off Port-au-Prince and after that I'm bringing in AP, Reuters, and Agence France.  Nobody's gonna write about an Appropriations Bill. Haiti's gonna get bumped to the  Lifestyle section."
22811,josh,Listen... Have you seen him today?
22814,c.j.,"All right. Listen, I've gotta..."
22827,bartlet,Okay. Send Fitzwallace down. Anything else?
22828,bartlet,They've been in there 48 hours.
22829,bartlet,The guy's been President of his country for two days. He's spent them both at gunpoint.
22830,bartlet,What do you know about this storm?
22831,bartlet,It's moving from Florida to South Carolina.
22833,bartlet,"No, I mean it's been designated a tropical storm. That means it has a surface wind  speed of something."
22834,bartlet,Isn't it strange to have a tropical storm in May?
22835,bartlet,I'm pretty sure there's a season and this isn't it.
22836,bartlet,I mean it's not a big deal. It's just that I'm pretty sure it's strange.
22837,bartlet,You ever been to National Cathedral?
22838,bartlet,You know you could lay the Washington Monument down on its side in that church?
22841,c.j.,Also in the combat radius will be six J-Socs out of McDill and a Battalion Landing Team.  They'll cover that at the Pentagon briefing.
22843,c.j.,"Of course it doesn't, but it should underline the consequences for Bazan should he  decide to enter our embassy and/or arrest the democratically elected President of  Haiti. That's all I have for now. Thank you."
22846,c.j., That's pretty hard to believe.
22848,c.j.,What are you talking about?
22852,c.j., There's been asbestos in the East Room  this whole time?
22854,c.j., Put together - okay - put together a list of alternatives.
22858,c.j.,"This isn't about seating arrangements. Notebooks, no tape recorders. This story's  embargoed for an hour, and you'll identify me as a senior White House official."
22865,bartlet,Do you have any idea why the door to the portico keeps swinging open? It's a little  annoying.
22866,bartlet, But the door opens out.
22869,bartlet,Charlie says there's a wind tunnel created by something. They're fixing the latch.
22872,bartlet,"Okay. Well, we've got to go. I don't know what to say. Leo's pretty rich. Maybe he can  buy some tech stocks and jack up the price."
22883,bartlet,The world'll rest easier. 
22892,bartlet,"Leo, would you do me a favor?"
22894,bartlet, Would you ask the agents to seal the cathedral for a minute?
22896,bartlet," You're a son of a bitch, you know that? "
22897,bartlet,"She bought her first new car and you hit her with a drunk driver. What, was that  supposed to be funny? ""You can't conceive, nor can I, the appalling strangeness of the  mercy of God,"" says Graham Greene. I don't know who's ass he was kissing there 'cause  I think you're just vindictive. What was Josh Lyman? A warning shot? That was my son.  What did I ever do to yours but praise his glory and praise his name? There's a  tropical storm that's gaining speed and power. They say we haven't had a storm this  bad since you took out that tender ship of mine in the north Atlantic last year...  68 crew. You know what a tender ship does? Fixes the other ships. Doesn't even carry  guns. Just goes around, fixes the other ships and delivers that mail. That's all it  can do.   I've committed many sins. Have I displeased you, you feckless thug? 3.8 million new  jobs, that wasn't good? Bailed out Mexico, increased foreign trade, 30 million new  acres of land for conservation, put Mendoza on the bench, we're not fighting a war,  I've raised three children..."
22898,bartlet, That's not enough to buy me out of the doghouse? Haec credam a deo pio?  A deo iusto? A deo scito? 
22899,bartlet,Cruciatus in crucem! Tuus in terra servus nuntius fui officium perfeci.  Eas in crucem!
22901,c.j.,We'll call them Answer A and Answer B.
22903,c.j.,Mr. President does this mean you won't be seeking a second term? Answer A is 'You bet.  I will absolutely be seeking a second term. I'm looking forward to the campaign. There is  great work that is yet to be done.'
22906,josh,'Are you out of your mind? I can't possibly win re-election. I lied about a degenerative  illness. I'm the target of a Grand Jury investigation and Congress is about to take me  out to lunch. I'd sooner have my family take their clothes off and dance the Tarantella  on the Truman Balcony than go through a campaign with this around my neck.'
22907,josh,You think that's too on the nose?
22918,toby,"There are no ways. The story's leaked. It's out there. We're doing this. Don't worry,  it's going to be fine. "
22919,toby, They're lighting him from outside the window.
22920,toby, I have a meeting with Greg Summerhays for reasons past understanding.
22925,toby,You want to buy Atlantic Intermediate.
22926,toby,"Greg, there's a reason the FCC..."
22928,toby,Okay. Thanks for coming in. Excuse me.
22935,josh, This is how it works today.
22937,toby, Don't anybody talk to me right now.
22938,toby,"Josh, Greg Summerhays was here to offer me a job.  Leo got me a damned lifeboat!"
22939,toby, I'm gonna rip his arms off...
22941,toby,...and beat him with his own...
22942,josh, That was Leo. He wants us over there. It's answer B.
22953,toby,She ran back to her office. 
22954,toby,They're gonna run this clip forever.
22956,toby,"Leo, you got me a lifeboat?"
22960,toby,Did you imagine there are any circumstances under which I would use it?
22965,toby,"You think he's gonna change his mind, don't you? "
22967,toby,You think he's gonna run?
22975,bartlet,That was the easy part.
22977,bartlet, Talk about the weather.
22979,bartlet,"And there's a tropical storm seizing, right?"
22981,bartlet,"Okay, and how many times say, in the last hundred years, has a tropical storm come off  the Atlantic seaboard to Washington in the middle of May?"
22988,bartlet,"According to the NOAA, the storm is a non-recurring phenomenon, which is science's term  for 'we don't know what in the world is going on, but we're stocking up on canned goods.'"
22989,c.j.,I just wanted to review a few things.
22990,bartlet,Is this stuff you don't think I'd remember from an hour ago?
22991,c.j.,"You'll want to take the first question from Lawrence Altman, the Times' Chief Medical  Correspondent."
22993,c.j.,"Because if you call on anyone else, the first question will be about reelection. Call  on Altman, it will be a medical question, and it'll have two or three follow-ups.  It'll allow you to feel comfortable a little before you start with the political mess."
22995,c.j.,"Altman will be in the front row, first seat on your right."
22999,c.j.,Where's Altman going to be?
23000,c.j.,"Mr. President, I'm going there right now. This is the last time I'm going to see you  before you step up... please, where's...?"
23001,bartlet,"Front row, first seat on the right."
23005,bartlet,Ah... Damn it! Mrs. Landingham!
23006,bartlet, The door keeps blowing open.
23008,bartlet,"It's not that I don't know how to use it, it's just that I haven't learned yet. "
23009,bartlet,"I have M.S., and I didn't tell anybody."
23010,bartlet,You're gonna make jokes?
23011,bartlet, The party's not going to want me to run.
23012,bartlet,"I've got a secret for you, Mrs. Landingham. I've never been the most popular guy in the  Democratic Party."
23014,bartlet,How about a child born this minute has a one in five chance of being born into poverty?
23019,bartlet,That's 13 million American children.
23020,bartlet,"Three and a half million kids go to schools that are literally falling apart. We need  127 billion in school construction, and we need it today!"
23022,c.j.,And he'll be speaking to that just as soon as he gets here.
23023,c.j.,"Uh, Frank, then Leslie."
23024,c.j.,"Tomorrow morning, the President will direct the Attorney General appoint a Special  Prosecutor, yes."
23026,c.j.,"A list of three prosecutors is given to a three-judge panel. The prosecutors, as well  as the judges, were all appointed by Republican presidents. "
23027,c.j.,"Please, I can only answer 14 or 15 questions at once. Hal!"
23028,c.j.,"I can't comment on a witness list that doesn't exist, but I imagine subpoenas will be  issued to most Senior White House Staff including myself."
23029,c.j.,"Again, I can't comment on what kind of hearings Congress has in mind. I'm sure there'll  be one but you'd have to talk to Congress."
23030,c.j.,"Okay, here now, the President of the United States. "
23031,c.j., Front row on your right.
23033,bartlet,"I'm sorry, Sandy, there was a bit of noise there, could you repeat the question?"
23038,toby,"If you work for an economist, he'll tell you, government doesn't create  jobs; business creates jobs."
23042,toby,Right now we're losing jobs.
23044,toby,You don't talk about economic accomplishemnts in a lousy economy.
23046,toby,"You want people saying, ""Hey, thanks for the nine million jobs. I've got  three of them, and I can't make the house payments""?"
23050,toby,No one watches the Friday evening news. No one reads the Saturday  papers. No Presidential events on Fridays.
23054,toby,This is how we get past crisis of the hour: seize the agenda again.
23056,toby,You need to learn this.
23058,toby,"We've barely had message since the campaign, let alone since Zoey. This  is your life for the next three months."
23060,toby,I'll drop you in Dupont Circle.
23062,toby,You think we should be touting economic accomplishment.
23064,toby,"Politics isn't about past performance-- it's ""what have you done for me  lately, and where's my years supply of turtle wax."""
23066,toby,It's someone looking for one of your 9 million new jobs.
23092,josh,I'm not reading it. There's some new stuff since the early edition.
23094,josh,"It's a puff piece, so I'll return the reporter's call, which I won't."
23096,josh,It's an embarassment. You should be stealing everyone's copies before  they can read it.
23098,josh,I'm serious. Save one for my mom.
23100,josh,"Look, don't... no gifts, no parties--just another day, okay?"
23106,josh,Speaker's trying to roll us again on stimulus. This story about me  sending a congressman a dead fish wrapped in newspaper--the Post get  this from you?
23110,josh,"Why, was there something in the... paper?"
23111,josh,"Yeah, I was the one who played sitar and made procedural changes."
23113,josh,"Okay, I don't think veins wield gavels, but..."
23114,josh,What about HHS appropriations?
23115,josh,Why don't you get that from Legislative Affairs?
23116,josh,"If the First Lady's got some last-minute budget request, run it through  the process."
23117,josh,"'Cause our budget's locked, and she's a sensitive topic around here.  Or... not around here, as the case may be."
23120,josh,"I didn't even talk to them, if that's what..."
23121,c.j.,Hats off to the Jewish-Connecticut Corleone.
23122,toby,I'm still trying to make the cover of Jane's Defense Weekly.
23123,josh,"Hey, that fish story..."
23125,toby,Personal approval's completely seperated from job performance.
23126,josh,"But ""strong leader"" is down, ""handling of economy"", way down."
23128,toby,"They love him at a barbecue, not so much with the nuclear launch codes."
23129,josh,We're not the ones who voted down the stimulus package.
23133,toby,217 military promotions that were supposed to pass the Senate last night.
23135,toby,A senator put them on anonymous hold.
23139,josh,He threatened it last week when he stiffed us on stimulus package--it's  Carrick.
23140,c.j.,So much for opportunity and security.
23141,toby,A fight in our own party over the military.
23142,josh,It's not going to be a fight. I got this one.
23146,josh,This is what I do. You got time to wrangle a senator on the Hill?
23153,josh,"Yeah, it's probably nothing."
23158,bartlet,"What's the problem with the Belgian elections, Leo?"
23160,bartlet,The intelligence briefing. The anti-immigrationist are gaining in the  north--doesn't say why or how.
23162,bartlet,I want a CIA briefer her in person every morning. Why'd I get this on  paper.
23167,bartlet,Months since we reduced a $2 trillion government to poll-test bromides.  You think James Madison ran his presidency off a message calendar?
23169,bartlet,"""Life"" on Modays, ""liberty"" on Wednesdays, ""shaking off the tyrannical  monarch"" on alternate Thursdays."
23171,bartlet,"Republicans gutted it, 'cause ""domestic violence isn't a public health  issue,"" as if spousal abuse were part of the Atkins diet."
23177,josh,I'm impressed. You read block-letter headlines.
23178,josh,"I used to work in the Senate, I do the Presidents Senate politics--I got  some sway down  there is all."
23179,josh,He tried to bottle up the fisheries bill. It wasn't... Is this an  inquisition?
23180,josh,I thought you were gonna gather up those profiles. Lord Bullingdon's  having a field day over here. 
23181,josh,We had a rule today--no gifts.
23183,josh,"How's that work, exactly?"
23185,josh,"Just don't tell anyone, okay? I don't want one of those sad-sack parties  in the Indian Treaty Room where some guy from the OMB drones on about  how I saved the aquatic weed subsidy."
23187,josh,Tell her to make time. I'm going to the Hill.
23189,josh,"You don't get to know everything, okay? This isn't an all-access pass.  You're not backstage at a Stones concert."
23191,josh,I want him sorting mail.
23192,toby,When consumer confidnce drops seven points instead of two...
23193,c.j.,It's not the economy. That's not why our poll numbers down.
23194,c.j.,"Yeah, you can stop giving me his messages."
23196,c.j.,A guy I lived with for six months.
23197,toby,I didn't know you lived with a guy named Ben.
23198,c.j.,There's a lot you don't know about me.
23200,c.j.,"Well, that's about it, really."
23201,toby,You don't want his calls?
23202,c.j.,"Well, if I take his call, of course it would be great to hear his  voice--he has this low, husky radio voice-- and we'd be swapping  memories and old jokes and pet names and then it's the frisky little  e-mails and pretty soon it's, you know, the weekend in Little Washington  and the late-night phone calls and that's when we begin to get on each  others nerves, 'cause we get on each others nerves. He has this thing  where he twirls his hair and... Anyway, the bloom's off the rose and I  don't call as much and it's the guilt and cherchez la femme and why- didn't-it-work-out-the-first-time and it's ten years til we talk again."
23203,toby,That was like a bad romantic comedy in fifteen seconds.
23206,c.j.,Latest drop in consumer confidence.
23208,toby,Why is the President dragging his feet on naming a new Chariman of the  Joint Chiefs?
23209,c.j.,The President's making his decision. Admiral Fitzwallace is still on the  job--one Chariman at a time.
23212,c.j.,Scrubbed two paragraphs?
23214,c.j.,What midlevel lacky tampers with an independant report?
23216,c.j.,I didn't mean to... Are we defending coal?
23218,c.j.,We have to do a total mea culpa. Make it a one-day story.
23220,c.j.,That's not going to fly if they have the original draft. There's a  threshold...
23224,toby,I'm worried about anything that takes us off our new message.
23229,toby,The President signed off.
23231,toby,You're gonna have a big role in this.
23233,toby,"I need you to sit down with the Labor Secretary, the Commerce Secretary,  the Vice President, walk them through their assigned economic speeches,  then..."
23235,toby,"We've been over this. If the President's stumping for the new stimulus  package on Tuesday, you look at the calendar, then the Labor Secretary  also talks..."
23237,toby,You're right--Cabinet flunkies have job responsibilites.
23239,toby,I'm not interested in his input.
23241,toby,You want me in the meeting with you?
23243,toby,"Give him his assignment. I don't care if he likes it. You work for the  President, so does he."
23244,josh,I get it: Idaho. That's funny.
23245,josh,"No, but he'll want to see me."
23246,josh,You can't block military promotions. We went over this last week. We  can't have an intraparty fight over this when the Republicans are  thrashing us on security.
23247,josh,"These are career officers who have risked their lifes in the Gulf, in  Africa."
23248,josh,What promises are those?
23251,josh,One problem with the MB-827 launcher.
23252,josh,It doesn't work. It's a missile defense system that can't hit missiles.  It's a $270 million slingshot the Pentagon doesn't want.
23253,josh,"No, let's talk about what you're going to do for our underpaid,  underpromoted fighting men and women."
23254,josh,And when were you promised...?
23255,josh,Under the last President?
23256,josh,"Okay, uh, a bunch of things have fallen by the wayside since then, like  communism."
23257,josh,"If you want to come asking for party favors, you shouldn't have voted  with the Republicans for five straight years. You shouldn't have voted  with them last week to kill our stimulus package."
23258,bartlet,"Nancy, I want these to go back to the Staff Secretary."
23260,bartlet,Did you hear about the Chief Justice?
23265,bartlet,That doesn't mean he gets to decompose on the bench. Are we taking care  of Carrick?
23267,bartlet,It went from gutted to double?
23269,bartlet,Is this a budget problem?
23271,bartlet, You think the Republicans want to make  it so expensive we'll cut it ourselves?
23273,bartlet,Are they trying to outflank us on the left?
23280,c.j.,You can't--you're his subordinate. That's a violation of ethics rule.
23281,c.j.,"You'd better believe you're my subordinate, and I dont think you even  brought a present at all."
23283,c.j.,There aren't enough phone books in the District of Columbia for you to  stand on.
23285,josh,He wants the MB-827 missile launcher.
23287,josh,"Yeah. The 97th Airborne's a stickler for that kind of thing, too."
23289,josh,Carrick wants that launcher. He wants a letter today.
23291,josh,"I've got a better idea. No Fitzwallace, no letter, no deal. Five years  he's voted with Republicans. Just last week he switched his vote and  jammed us on the stimulus package. That's why we're in this mess. We  want to keep rolling over for him?"
23293,josh,"Sometimes. We give him everything, he screws us everytime. this guy  makes Machiavelli look like a social worker."
23295,josh,So we award him for rolling us? That'll keep him in line.
23297,josh,"Unless we want more and more of them. We've got to stop feeding the hand  that bites us, Leo. No Fitzwallace, no letter, no deal. I need your  proxy on this."
23299,josh,"That, uh, ""one-man majority"" stuff? You know they didn't get that from  me?"
23301,josh,"Call Carrick's Chief of Staff--the launcher's off the table. Tell him...  tell him there's no such thing as a free ""launch""."
23305,josh,"How about telling me I can see her? I got five minutes for her, and she  can wait in my office all day if necessary."
23309,josh,It's a meeting. Would you...? I don't do birthday celebrations.
23311,josh,"My seventh birthday, my parents hired a birthday clown. Big nose,  seltzer bottle, the whole drill. And he just did all his tricks for my  sister. She even got to keep one of his floppy shoes."
23313,josh,Tell Amy's office I'm on my way.
23315,josh,You're telling me to call my mother.
23316,josh,What's the First Lady doing? Why do you need list of Congrsseional  committees?
23317,josh,She's making an end run around the budget process. YOu're not supposed  to...
23318,josh,"Leo's on to whatever you're doing with HHS Appropriations. I practically  lied about it.  Next time, I'm not gonna."
23320,josh,"Oh, like I'm going to get between the Bartlets. Your job is to run it  though the process."
23321,josh,I am the principal's office.
23323,c.j.,The President's only concern is passing his stimulus package to get more  Americans in good jobs. He's hopeful Congress will move his new version  to the floor immediately. Mark?
23324,c.j.,We've set up a whole Wing in the White House to handle his paparazzi.  I'm just hoping for a decent table at the Palm. 
23326,c.j.,The White House fells the EPA report will reflect administration views.
23327,c.j.,The final report will aly out views on a range of issues.
23329,c.j.,I don't accept your premise.
23330,c.j.,I'm sure you all look forward to reading the actual report.
23331,c.j.,"If there was interference with an independent report, that was obviously  a mistake."
23333,c.j.," But I assure you, the final report will reflect administration  policy. Sally?"
23336,c.j.,They had both drafts. There was nothing I could do.
23338,c.j.,Coal is the dirtiest energy on the planet. That's worth censoring out of  a report?
23340,c.j.,Clean coal's an industry myth.
23342,c.j.,"Clean coal is like saying ""healthy botulism,"" ""child-safe plutonium""..."
23344,c.j.,"I don't know, neither does the EPA, but they're trying to tell the truth  and we gagged them, and who gave us the right? Are we surprised our  polls are down? We have a responsibilty to the country. We can't just  spin any line we make up."
23346,c.j.,Not when no one will believe it.
23348,c.j.,You don't want me to do that.
23350,c.j.,That's saying I wasn't speaking for this White House.
23352,bartlet,Violence prevention jumped another 30 million in an hour?
23353,bartlet,Do we know why it's happening? 
23354,bartlet,"Well, do we or don't we?"
23358,bartlet,Don't do anything. Thanks.
23363,josh,"Your family's had a lot of press attention, right?"
23364,josh,I meant since Reconstruction.
23365,josh,"How do you, you know, deal with it?"
23367,josh,So answer the question.
23370,toby,"Happy birthday, by the way."
23371,josh,I really don't want you making a big deal out of that.
23374,toby,I walked the Minority Leader through the message calendar.
23375,josh,Triplehorn ought to be jazzed--his pension stuff's on there.
23376,toby,He tells me we're not giving Carrick a missle launcher he very much  wants.
23377,josh,"The Minority Leader wants us to cave, right? If he could manage his own  caucus, we wouldn't have this provlem."
23378,toby,"Well, Carrick's vulnerable in Idaho. We can't win back the Senate  without him."
23379,josh,You're suggesting we build a multi-million-dollar heap of garbage the  DOD doesn't even want?
23380,toby,"Well, sometimes they find other uses for the technology. I-I..."
23381,josh,Great. They can turn it into a toaster that doesn't make toast. This has  zero to do with defense technology.
23382,toby,"The Minority Leader thinks we could lose our best chance to get him on  the new stimulus package, on our tax bill."
23384,toby,"49% job approval isn't the time to go calling bluffs. We got to get off  this, onto our issues."
23385,josh,The stuff that this guy has all ready bilked us for out of a state of  about mime people...
23386,toby,He's an Idaho Democrat. He's an endangered species. If he needs a little  pork...
23387,josh,"The Volcanic Soil Museum, the Canola Oil Feul Cell Initiative..."
23389,josh,"The Shakespeare in Military Communitues Program. I mean, what's the hell  wrong with Hemingway?"
23390,toby,Maybe we cut our losses.
23391,josh,That's easy for you to say. I'm the one who lost him on stimulus. I'm  the one who has to get him on our agenda. I'm the one lacing up concrete  shoes on the front page of the Post.
23392,toby,Been on a... have you been on a fishing trawler recently?
23393,josh,"Donna! I'm fine on Carrick. Do your job, I'll do mine."
23394,josh,It stinks in here. It's like working in Moby Dick's gym locker.
23399,bartlet,We're doing pretty well on violence prevention.
23400,bartlet,"They were going to gut it, First Lady really turned it around."
23401,bartlet,"Nah, I'm not going to have Abbey jump through hoops."
23403,bartlet,"The First Lady, how many calls did she make to members of the  Sumcommittee today? "
23404,bartlet,"No calls. She's hiking in the White Mountains. She made no calls, you  made them."
23405,bartlet,Don't tell me what she believes.
23406,bartlet,My wife is not a budget appropriation. She's not a line. Don't put words  in her mouth. Don't treat her like she's your blank checkbook.
23407,bartlet,She has to be here to want things... and you don't have to be here at  all.
23408,toby,I said blue. Blue. Green is the color of money. This is about people's  lives.
23409,toby,"Just stick to black and white. I fact, quill and parchment's okay. I  need this for the Treasury Secretary. "
23410,toby,Did you get the VP's sign-off?
23412,toby,What did you get exactly?
23415,toby,"Russell's an empty cowboy suit, you work for the leader of the free  world."
23417,toby,The calendar. I need the calendar.
23419,toby,What did you tell Russell about the job?
23421,toby,You're not considering it.
23423,toby,You are not considering it.
23425,toby,"You think I want to be making calendars? You think I like being in a PR  dogfight with Congress, writing banner copy for photo ops?!"
23426,toby,Calendar's aren't... It's a calendar. Make it look like a calendar. How  hard is that?  This is the NBA. You don't go back to shirts and  skins.
23427,josh,"Okay, let's talk about the fish. You don't understand this building."
23428,josh,"I'm talking about a code, an ethos you don't understand."
23429,josh,"The Post profile, the ""legislative juggernaut,"" all those anecdotes, all  those quotes came from you."
23430,josh,We don't glorify ourselves. How is the President going to feel when I've  got better press than him? How's every punk congressional staffer going  to feel when I'm taking victory laps the week after losing a key vote?
23431,josh,We don't advertise. It's not the code.
23432,josh,"The only constituency that matters in this building is the constituency  of one--the guy in the round room, and that's who you and I work for."
23433,josh,You serve the issue by serving the man.
23434,josh,What are you talking about?
23436,josh,Apologize. You got to go apologize.
23437,josh,"Hang on. Just hang on a second, okay?"
23441,josh,Unless the meeting's to strap Chris Carrick to his idiot missile  launcher and fling him head first into an ICBM--which he'll miss--then...
23445,josh,"I'm leaking to every newspaper in the known universe that Carrick's  blocking military promotions, for a hunk of pork barrel, defense-  industrial scrap metal."
23447,josh,I'm calling his bluff. I'm making him crawl down here on his knees. I'll  be in the press office.
23448,toby,Sorry about before. You have a future here. We should talk about it.
23450,toby,"My portfolio, the speeches, the day-to-day, I'm going to give it to you."
23452,toby,I'm stepping back to do big-think-- work in the legacy.
23460,toby,You took the Russell job. This isn't line on a resume. None of us... you  don't walk away.
23462,toby,"Yeah, well, maybe we'll print up t-shirts."
23474,c.j.,"The EPA's an independent agency, Leo."
23478,c.j.,And holding your line makes it a two or three-day story at the least.  The whole room thinks we screwed up whether we admit it or not.
23480,c.j.,"I appreciate your apology, but if I'm going to fullfill my duty to the  country, I don't just need to know what you're thinking. I need to know  that you're listening to me when I say you made a mistake."
23482,c.j.,We're here to serve the country.
23485,bartlet,The Flemish Bloc is gaining in the north.
23486,bartlet,"The Flemish Bloc. The Flemish Bloc, ultra-nationalist in Belgium.  Skinheads, really, neo-nazis. They're wearing three-piece suits,  speaking in coded discourse now instead of angry chants, and they're  gaining in the north. When everyone wears the same suit, how does anyone  know which side they're on anymore?"
23487,bartlet,You're not fired. Abbey would choose you over me anyway.
23488,bartlet,She didn't... I didn't talk to Abbey about this. Zoey told me she was  hiking.
23489,bartlet,Tell 'em the First Lady wants violence prevention fully funded.
23491,toby,You were looking for me?
23493,toby,"Did I forget the secret password?  We talked about my  giving up communications, leaving it to Will and focusing on big-picture."
23495,toby,"When will it be the time?  Message of the day, top of the news  hour, our second term and we're acting like a losing campaign."
23499,toby,Will can do it. I'll supervise him.
23503,toby,We have an economic policy held together with scotch tape and baling  wire. FDR built the middle class in a hundred days. How many days do  we even have left?
23505,toby,"How about fighting for the old one, instead of haggling with Republicans  over how much to cut? We created nine million jobs. Now they're  disappearing. Outsourcing, downsizing, buyouts. They build T.V.'s in  Mexico for a dollar a day, on dirt floors with cardbaord  walls..."
23507,toby,"It's on our watch, Leo. Where's our hundred days? Where's our Great  Society? Where's our New Frontier? Somebody's got to do what we came  here to do. Those jobs aren't coming back. We lose our cave every battle  we have with Congress, and we have a calendar, not a plan."
23509,toby,I'm asking the President not to let him.
23513,josh,"Hey, anything from Amy?"
23519,josh,I think she's been fired--she thinks so. I-I kind of unloaded on her.
23521,josh,"She'll be... ah, I don't know what she'll be."
23525,josh,Chris Carrick's here? Now?
23528,josh,I hope that lesson won't be lost when our new stimulus package hits the  floor.
23533,josh,You're switching parties 'cause we won't give you a launcher that  doesn't even...
23534,josh,You can't be serious...
23535,josh,"We can't win back the Senate without Idaho. We can't pass the tax bill,  the new stimulus package. I'll get you a meeting with Fitzwallace.  A meeting with the President."
23536,josh,You're leaving the party be... this is 'cause of me?!
23537,toby,"Okay, here it is. Chief Justice Roy Ashland may not be enlarged in death beyond what  he was in life: an idealist, not an icon, a man, not a monument... "
23538,toby,...a believer in the irreducible power of the law to shape our society.
23539,c.j.,"Okay, but I gotta be careful about saying 'man.'"
23540,c.j.,"You'd be surprised, I get letters."
23541,toby,"Fine. Human being then, or do the other mammals complain?"
23543,toby,Who said you could come in here?
23547,toby,"Granit, Keith, and Toland. And no, we're not talking about it."
23552,c.j.,Yet another researcher quit.
23554,c.j.,The third since you quit.
23561,c.j.,"Happy. You know, sensation your fellow mammalians occasionally experience."
23562,toby,"Haffley's treating the discretionary budget like a chew toy. We're about to cave on tax  cuts for billionaires and who the hell knows what else... Angela Blake is giving away  in there.  But you know what, we're going to appoint a new chief  justice. Breathe new life into the Constitution. Do you know how rare that is? The last  five guys didn't get to do it. We're gonna shape the future of jurisprudence, the laws  that sustain our whole society, or shove somebody in there to strike down these  God-awful excuses for laws the Republicans are passing."
23564,toby,Enough already. Buffalo Bob is not going to pick the next Chief Justice.
23567,josh,Do you have any of those pills left from that naval doctor?
23569,josh,The cold and sinus stuff?
23571,josh,It was Harry Chaipman. Those big blue ones.
23575,josh,"No. Nothing natural. I need the industrial strength, full-throttle stuff."
23582,josh,You should've said I was in the Oval. Didn't it occur to you to say I was in the Oval?
23585,josh,"Fortunately Pa and I brought in the last of the winter wheat yesterday, so I don't have  to operate the combine."
23587,josh,Get another continuing resolution.
23589,josh,"The Republican majority, but you're close."
23591,josh,"Well, you're forgetting the beauty of the federal budget process."
23596,c.j.,He works for Diane Mathers.
23597,c.j.,The ecstasy? Did you talk to him about it?
23598,c.j.,"It's okay, you did the right thing."
23599,c.j.,"Nothing. I've got it from here. Thanks, Charlie."
23600,toby,He's not returning the President's calls?
23602,toby,Intensive care? I thought it was... CNN said it was exhaustion. 
23604,toby,How do we know he's not...?
23608,toby,"My grandfather lived to be 96 but the last 20 years he thought the Hapsburgs still  lived in a palace in Vienna. How long before this gets dangerous, Leo? Before we've  got a cadaver up there ruling on when life begins?"
23610,toby,"We're talking about an empty robe, and I don't like this any more than you do. If Roy  Ashland were a religion, I'd convert. But what happens if we wait until he's senile,  or ends up in a coma? Then what? We go to our Republican Congress to impeach? Haffley'll  never do that! He'll leave Ashland on a respirator until one of their guys is wearing  the windbreaker on Air Force One."
23617,toby,"The chief justice won't take the President's calls, maybe we need to send someone over  there."
23619,toby,"It's time to get Ashland off the bench, Leo."
23624,toby,It got in the way of a misfiled copy of the Congressional record.
23626,toby,Can we get back to the chief justice?
23630,bartlet, It's going to be a brisk 42 tomorrow. Time to break out that  Irish fishing sweater that C.J. says makes me look like an Irish fisherman.
23632,josh,I'm past the infectious stage.
23633,c.j.," Excuse me, sir, if I may, this Diane Mathers interview..."
23634,bartlet,You still have a problem?
23636,bartlet,Abbey thinks it'll be fine.
23638,bartlet,"I think so too. Where's Angela, Leo?"
23640,bartlet,She knew this was at ten?
23643,toby,"Sir, the Chief Justice still isn't returning calls."
23644,bartlet,"Yeah, I tried him a couple of times. They're saying it was exhaustion now?"
23645,toby,"Yes, sir, but we can't get anyone to confirm it. His doctors are referring us back to  his office."
23646,bartlet,"Roy was a great friend, a great man."
23647,toby,If his medical condition prevents him from performing his duties as...
23648,bartlet,He's the best judge of his capacities.
23649,josh,"Sorry, I just took this sinus stuff. I think I just lost the hearing in my... my left  ear."
23651,c.j.,Sorry. I'm not getting it.
23652,josh,I'm actually getting over it.
23655,toby,Excuse me? What are we talking about?
23656,toby,When was tuition put on the table?!
23657,c.j.,It was a major campaign promise.
23658,toby,"It was the centerpiece of our re-elect!  Josh, you just going to sit  there?"
23659,josh, You gotta trust the person in the room.
23660,bartlet,"Can we do this, Angela?"
23661,bartlet,Without the deficit topping 200 billion?
23662,bartlet," Then everything else is on the table. Thanks everyone, that's it."
23663,bartlet,200 billion dollar deficit and Haffley wants tax cuts. Take away a few zeroes and he'd  pass for a mob accountant.
23664,c.j.,"I'm sorry, Mister President, but I don't think Zoey should do this interview."
23665,bartlet,The Diane Mathers thing again?
23666,c.j.,Charlie got a phone call from one of Mathers' producers. They got his statement to the  Secret Service about Zoey considering taking the ecstasy and I think they might have  Jean-Paul telling his side of the story.
23667,bartlet,Abbey thinks Zoey can handle it.
23668,c.j.,"Diane Mathers is very good at her job. Sir, if you won't let me cancel it, at least  let me go up there, make sure she's prepared, run some interference."
23670,c.j.,"Thank you, Mister President. "
23672,bartlet, And Abbey? Who's going to check with her?
23680,josh,"Yeah, we started a couple of months ago."
23681,josh,"I got the governors coming in on emission standards, the Japan trip..."
23682,josh,Donna Moss. Okay. Sure.
23683,toby,You were looking for me?
23684,toby,"Deductible tuition! What's next? We could save a few bucks by shutting the east wing,  turn the south lawn into the mother of all garage sales."
23686,toby,"It's process, Leo! Two months from now no one will give a damn about continuing  resolutions!"
23692,toby,We can't force him to resign.
23696,toby,You used to clerk for the Chief Justice. That's interesting.
23697,toby,I've just never heard you mention it. Guys around here with two-bit appellate  courtships staple it to their foreheads.
23698,toby,You haven't even heard what I'm going to say.
23702,toby,The President sets the direction of the Court. I've read the Constitution too.
23703,toby,"You don't have to ask him to resign, only to sit down with the President."
23709,josh,We can call her Angela now.
23711,josh,Sure. Did we ever get specifics for...?
23713,c.j.,"...I need HHS public affairs, DPC, Toby, and Will to walk them through the talking  points, any key developments on the Hill. I have to phone AP and the Post...   Carol?"
23714,c.j.,I was just talking to her...
23716,c.j.,How about some John Phillips Sousa?
23718,c.j.,"This is a woman who gets dictators to cry, talk about their love of puppies and momma's  cooking, confess they had the concentration camps built because they couldn't get a  date for the prom."
23719,c.j.,So everyone keeps saying. The President hasn't changed his mind about coming?
23720,c.j.,I thought he would in the end.
23728,toby,No. We're going in here.
23729,toby,"I'm curious. It wouldn't be for the obvious reason, would it?"
23730,toby,You're a conservative. Maybe you'd love to see him stay on the bench. A liberal icon  reduced to a quivering mass of octogenarian confusion!
23731,toby,Hanging on until he can be replaced by a paleo Republican! The Constitution's a living  document. You stick to it like it's a boiler plate lease!
23733,toby,He has memory lapses. He drifts during oral arguments.
23734,toby,"The associate Justices are already postponing decisions, holding over important cases,  going behind his back to assign opinions!"
23735,toby,"Yeah, I do. There's no one else left, Joe. He's outlived his wife, his son was shot  down over Hanoi. There's just his clerks, clerks like you."
23736,toby,"Let's go over there together right now, you and me."
23737,toby,"He'll see you. You tell me he's okay, and I'll call off the vultures."
23738,toby,I just came along to keep Joe company. I saw a coffee cart in the lobby. You want  anything?
23740,toby,I'll be downstairs when you're done.
23742,toby,What'd he say? How is he? Was he coherent?
23744,toby,"Your side does it better, pushing neo-conservatives in swaddling clothes, hoping they  don't grow a conscience, let alone a meager understanding of jurisprudence."
23745,toby, What did he'd say? Or can he even speak?
23748,josh,"It's a new thing I'm doing, sort of a positive attitude thing."
23750,josh, Donna's in the budget negotiations?
23752,toby, I think I'm coming down with something.
23753,toby,"You say that, but in a way that makes me wonder if you really are."
23754,toby,I was in a room with Ashland once.
23755,toby,I was a student at City College. Student organizing committee got him to give a speech  about the history of voting rights. We were hanging from the rafters.
23756,toby,"I talked to him afterwards. I mean, he wouldn't remember me. But I spent the next six  weeks organizing a voter registration drive. You know when you go out West how they  say, don't miss the Grand Canyon, it's one of the few things in life that when you see  it, it doesn't disappoint? That's Roy Ashland."
23757,toby," I don't want to see him gone, Joe. I want nine Ashlands on the court. I just-I  just wish he was 40 years younger."
23758,c.j.,"Diane likes to keep things warm, casual, but she'll try to zing you with some indirect  attribution like ""People say,"" or ""There's a rumor that."" "
23760,c.j.,There's a rumor that you're seeing a therapist.
23762,c.j.," If you don't answer, she'll just wait, like an infinitely forgiving,  infinitely patient cross between the Virgin Mary and a schnouzer."
23766,c.j.,"Zoey, we need to take a moment and talk about that night at the club with Jean-Paul.  Had you agreed to take drugs?"
23771,josh,"You've got to be kidding. You let it drag on that long, they'll try to de-fund the  Yule log."
23774,josh,"No, Leo. How is this acceptable? Haffley's not the Prime Minister. You take this to  the President, you know what he'll say?"
23778,josh,"This isn't governing, it's duck and cover."
23781,josh,I don't know. Embarrassed.
23785,josh,You're saying it was me.
23788,josh,It's nice when you make new friends.
23792,toby,So now we won't have a budget until we're up against the State of the Union.
23794,toby,He's coming over to see the President.
23798,toby,I just got off the phone with Joe Quincy.
23800,toby,Leo. We gave away college tuition for nothing.
23803,c.j.,She'll be wrapping up. That was her big gun.
23807,c.j.,I meant you've raised a remarkable young woman.
23809,c.j.," Mrs. Bartlet, may I say, we miss you."
23811,c.j.,"It's been very busy. The budget, Japan in a few weeks, and the Chief Justice... "
23816,bartlet,"Well, yes, there's something going around."
23817,bartlet,"I'm glad to see you doing so well, sir."
23819,bartlet,"I don't want to. But if it's time, if your condition warrants."
23820,bartlet,I'd hoped to consult with you.
23822,bartlet,"The other eight are preparing to take it away from you, Roy. Holding over cases, the  major decisions. How long can the country wait?"
23833,bartlet,"Yes, thanks, Robert. And thanks for saying it this time. I think I had to make that  little speech the last time around."
23834,bartlet,"Or maybe the time before. This is our third CR, our third time coming up short. We  have to do better. People aren't paying us to duck the hard choices. You want to run  through the details, Angela?"
23837,bartlet,We had a deal at one percent.
23839,bartlet,"In two months. Five percent? 50? How many rounds do we go, Jeff? I'm just asking."
23854,toby,We had a deal at one percent!
23856,josh,It's only 8:30. We'll get a deal before midnight.
23861,bartlet, You were there. Make sure Nancy sees me in the morning about the ?  in Indonesia. I don't want any training East of Kupan. Anything else?
23863,bartlet,"Give them your shirt, they want your built."
23864,bartlet,Not tonight.  Damn! I probably missed the first half. Providence is  going to get a whopping from my fighting Irish.
23866,josh,What the hell happened?
23875,c.j.,Are they coming back tonight?
23876,toby,I sure as hell hope so.
23877,c.j.,"Amtrak, the courts, federal prisons, border patrol, national weather service, all open,  and meat inspectors will remain on the job."
23878,toby, Nothing jeopardizes the sanctity of the American hamburger.
23879,c.j.,The EPA is suspending 60 percent of factory inspections. Good news for polluters.
23881,c.j.," We had agreed to a one percent cut on a 30 day continuing  resolution, but the Speaker pulled a bait-and-switch."
23882,toby," One percent, two percent, what's so unreasonable about  three percent?"
23883,c.j.,"Three percent equals X dollars, which is Y flu vaccinations, Z school lunches. "
23884,c.j.,It's more convincing with numbers. Carol!
23885,toby, I'll get you the numbers.
23886,c.j., He's on the front lawn?!
23888,c.j.,Should I wait for Haffley to finish?
23889,toby,We gotta start reclaiming some ground.
23890,c.j.,"Okay, but I need some numbers fast, maybe some garlic and a crucifix."
23892,c.j.,"Good evening everybody. Katie, get back here. Let's start with the good news. National  security and public safety will not be affected."
23896,josh,You do realize you're not a special assistant.
23898,josh," Donna, listen carefully. You have to go home."
23902,toby,Your phones are ringing.
23904,toby,What's the President doing?
23908,toby," If it doesn't end now, it'll become a referendum on the Bartlet  Presidency."
23910,toby,Do you want me to talk to him?
23913,c.j.,"Well, I can't speak for Congress, but the President will not cut essential services,  which is what their CR does."
23914,c.j.," Three percent equals more than a billion dollars in education  funding, clean energy funding, highway safety, to name a few. I'll get you exact  figures."
23915,c.j.,It wasn't the will of the 196 congressmen and 16 senators who voted against all 14  appropriations bills.
23917,josh,Why don't you just take them on disk?
23919,josh,Not unless you want three federal agents trailing you home.
23921,josh,I can survive for a day.
23924,josh,"Start a tally of programs affected by the shutdown, and email it to me as you go.  Don't read anything in the folder marked ""private."" "
23927,josh,You remember when we went to Atlantic City?
23929,josh,"Remember when I went to Atlantic City and I came back complaining that all the pro  poker players suck all the fun out of the game, no cigars, no pizza, no beer."
23931,josh,"Those guys, they bet the bank when they have a good hand. And you either fold, or you  go in all the way with them. I think the President's gonna stay in."
23933,josh,He's better than anyone we've seen on the other side of the table in a long time. 
23934,josh,"Hey, advisory board still at ten tomorrow?"
23936,josh,"I left word with violence prevention and business roundtable, but what about the  address to the NAACP tomorrow? Should we cancel? It's non-governmental, we'll need  advance."
23938,toby, What kind of agreement?
23940,josh, We have to call Haffley out for what he's really doing. It's a coup. He's  trying to de-fund every Bartlet initiative we passed in the last two years.
23943,toby,"That's what Haffley wants. 940,000 federal employees out of work, but we say, no  worries, doesn't matter."
23951,c.j.,"Okay, but the enemy's advancing, and you better give me more than a squirt gun before  the sun comes up."
23953,toby,The mess is closed. There's no coffee.
23954,c.j.,Starbucks closes at 7:00. Try Swaine's at 17th and G.
23956,c.j.,The British Prime Minister...
23958,c.j.,"It's a state dinner, 216 guests, formal attire..."
23960,toby,"We can put together a strategy, but Leo, there isn't anything else until we sign a  deal."
23965,bartlet,Doesn't matter. The game is won or lost in the last five minutes.
23969,bartlet,"I took his Vice President, I dropped my stimulus package, my college tuition tax credit,  and now we're haggling not over the budget, but over how much to cut."
23971,bartlet,Dammit! They've got a seven foot center and best power center in the game. Why zone?
23974,c.j.,Let's just say it hasn't won me any new friends in the media.
23978,c.j.,"They keep saying they're Scrooge, denying the needy. They say we're addicted to  spending. Both our negatives are up, but ours more."
23981,c.j.,"The Post is reporting 193,000 veterans can't get their home loans processed. We can't  be doing this over the holidays."
23993,toby," No, thank you, I've got it."
23996,toby,Did you see the Post/ABC poll this morning?
24000,c.j.,Where are we on the state dinner?
24002,c.j.,"Except we don't have food, chefs, or help."
24007,toby,And Haffley is running the government.
24011,toby,And that has the rare quality of also being true.
24015,bartlet,One percent like we'd agreed.
24021,josh,"Sure, thanks. Rina, right?"
24024,josh,"No, I mean why weren't you laid off like everyone else?"
24027,josh,So that list of shutdown effects you faxed?
24029,josh,Why'd you put social security on the list? It's an entitlement.
24031,josh,The checks won't go out.
24033,josh,It's considered coercion if you come back to work as a volunteer.
24035,josh,AARP considers you essential.
24039,josh,You're right. Get a cheaper apartment.
24043,josh,I don't need calligraphy. He knows where my office is.
24046,toby,That's what the people who get their checks every month think.
24047,c.j.,"Well, that's one way to make the shutdown seem real to the country: don't mail 11  million checks."
24049,toby,FDR will rise from the dead.
24053,toby,Josh is taking care of it.
24067,bartlet,"The mess is closed. When this is gone, I'm going to have to start in on the grandkid's  elbow macaroni."
24069,bartlet,"Yeah, there's something going around. They said your motorcade arrived an hour ago.  Where you been?"
24073,bartlet,Haffley reneged on the deal.
24076,bartlet, Haffley came to us with a deal?
24079,bartlet,Staying through the holidays?
24083,c.j.,I'm on my way outside for the briefing. Anything new?
24084,toby,Time/CBS has us down another six points.
24085,c.j.,I don't think I'm going to bring that up. Josh still in there with Leo and Angela?
24086,toby,"Or maybe it's twelve or thirteen, I've lost count."
24087,c.j.,"Toby, we've all been assuming this is the President not understanding what's really  going on. He's been so out of it since Zoey, you know, and we've all been protecting  him, you, me, Leo. But what if it's something else?"
24090,toby,"Republicans have us and they know it. He and Josh are the only ones who don't. Okay,  it's something else, like what?"
24092,josh,The President's already said that three percent is unacceptable.
24093,josh,"Three days, three years, it's still unacceptable!"
24094,toby,"One percent, three percent, five percent, the CR is nothing if we never get around to  passing a budget!"
24097,bartlet,"Who's coming to Jesus, Leo, me or you?"
24098,bartlet,Three percent. 60 days. 
24100,toby,People are frustrated with both parties. It's a plague on both our houses.
24103,josh,"What do you want, Mr. President?"
24104,bartlet,I want to be able to govern.
24105,josh,Let's go up to the Hill to see them.
24106,toby,We can't go to the Hill. We'll look even more desperate.
24107,josh,The country's waiting for someone to step up. It should be us.
24111,bartlet,Then I suggest we get a move on.
24114,c.j.,I want to reiterate that the talks are ongoing; just not formal negotiations.
24115,c.j.,We're talking about negotiating. George?
24116,c.j.,"I certainly hope not, I bought a shiny new Donna Karan and I'll be very disappointed  if it has to stay in my closet. Mark?"
24117,c.j.,You want me to comment on the weather?
24118,c.j.,"I don't know, IHOP? Thank you, everybody."
24121,c.j.,I just finished the gaggle.
24122,josh,"Get back to the press corps. POTUS is going up to the Hill. We're gonna pay a surprise  visit to Haffley. C.J., did you hear me?"
24124,josh,He's only been speaker for a few months. He's in over his head.
24125,josh,And nothing we've done has surprised him.
24126,bartlet," Kansas plates. That's a long way to  travel to find a ""closed"" sign."
24130,josh,We stopped to address a group of tourists.
24131,c.j.,The President is talking to tourists?
24132,josh,"Yeah, the bus says Kansas... Blue Jays, Jayhawks, whatever the hell."
24133,c.j.,"You wait another 30 seconds and he'll also be addressing NBC, ABC, and CNN."
24135,c.j.,"Next to you, they're going to interrupt ""Days of our Lives."""
24136,josh,Thanks.  How long a walk would you say it is from  here to Haffley's office?
24137,josh,Secret Service's going to love this.
24138,bartlet," During the campaign, I visited the Westford Rehabiliation Center  there. They're closed today, too because of the shutdown. But if Congress has their  way, it will lose 40 percent of it's funding. I'd rather see it shut down for a week  than for good."
24141,josh,The Capitol is just a five or ten minute walk from here. Care to stretch your legs?
24142,bartlet,"I'm sorry folks, I've got a meeting on the Hill."
24144,bartlet,What do you say we walk the rest of the way?
24145,josh,Hello. President Bartlet is here to see Speaker Haffley.
24146,josh,They're finishing something up. 
24147,bartlet,Then we'll just have to wait.
24158,c.j.,"Yes, ma'am. Mrs. Bartlet, it's good to have you back."
24159,c.j., The Bartlets will also be serving their guests a Colorado beet  salad and California green beans.
24161,c.j.,I attribute it to the President's sincere desire to reach a settlement. Shirley?
24164,toby,They got more volunteers than they expected.
24165,toby,It's a successful program. That's what happens when something succeeds.
24166,toby,"People should get combat pay, they go into inner cities to teach children, with no  parents, work in soup kitchens, try to get addicts off the streets."
24170,toby,What are they offering?
24182,bartlet,"Leo? These last months, thank you. Thank you for everything."
24187,bartlet,"Yeah, it's been going around."
24188,bartlet,"Well, we should get started. Abbey's having the Prime Minister and his wife over for  dinner, and I promised to be on time."
24189,bartlet," We're not doing another CR, Mr. Speaker."
24191,bartlet," All 14 appropriations bills, exactly as we left them four days ago. It took us  what, ten months to work out our differences on those bills."
24192,bartlet,"I agree. I want you to cut agriculture subsidies, and you want me to cut Medicaid,  again. You know I'll veto any Medicaid cuts, and I know you won't give me any  agriculture cuts. So, here we are."
24193,bartlet," No. We were 100 billion apart, and I met you halfway, at 50 billion.  Then we were 50 billion apart, and I suspect if I'd gone down to 25, we'd be 12  billion apart."
24194,bartlet,This administration has created the greatest amount of wealth in history.
24195,bartlet,"Not everyone can pull themselves up by their bootstraps, Mr. Speaker. "
24196,bartlet, You're not going to demonize the millions of selfless teachers and public  servants who are...
24197,bartlet,"Well, I'm not going to negotiate with anyone who holds a gun to my head! We had a deal!  I don't care if my approval ratings drop into single digits. I am the President of the  United States and I will leave this government shut down until we reach an equitable  agreement! "
24205,josh,You hear about the NBA rookie who pulled his first rebound the night Wilt Chamberlain  pulled 55?
24207,josh,Said it was the proudest day of his life. Together he and Wilt went for 34 points  and 56 rebounds.
24212,toby,It is worth noting that Philadelphia lost that game.
24214,josh,What did we get? Another continuing resolution?
24216,c.j.,Their cap gains tax cut?
24218,toby,What about our college tuition tax credit?
24219,bartlet,"No, but it's a tax cut. Republicans are always in favor of tax cuts, so if we can find  a way to make it revenue-neutral next year, it stays."
24220,bartlet,"We'd already done our part, so the Speaker graciously agreed to do his."
24222,bartlet,"Okay, Abbey says I have about five minutes before dinner. What's next?"
24223,c.j.," Sleigh bells ringing and jing-jing-jingling, ding-ding-ding  ding..."
24225,c.j.,I'm holding up my tree. Isn't it nice?
24226,toby,What are you doing to it?
24227,c.j.,I'm holding it up. The stand isn't...
24228,toby,They didn't have anything smaller?
24229,c.j.,Smaller than me is a shrub. I wanted a real tree this year.
24231,toby,This is fine. I just cut some of the naked gloating.
24232,c.j.,"We restarted the government, Toby. There was a showdown at the OK Corral,  and we gunned down the Clantons. We're heroes."
24234,c.j.,Can we get a bigger stand?
24235,c.j.,"No comments for anything called the Crier, the Intelligencer or the  Breeze."
24236,c.j., That's against the law. It's what the  DEA does with their time.
24237,bartlet,"All three of our daughters in one place for Christmas. You've never seen  that, have you?"
24240,bartlet,What if she quits before then? She's flighty.
24242,bartlet,I'm grateful. But Debbie thinks one night isn't a visit so much as a pit  stop.
24245,bartlet,I'm not dwelling. I think it's fine. I think we should all spend  Christmas at Liz's in-laws.
24247,bartlet,Never again. I still have flashbacks.
24251,bartlet,You should get a few of the dinner with the family together. I'll be  there.
24255,bartlet,How hard could it possibly be?
24257,bartlet,I'm not asking her to stay a week. It's one meal.
24261,bartlet,I don't want to sit next to Doug tonight. I don't want to hear about his  kayak.
24263,bartlet,"Tell Ellie if she's late, she has to sit next to Doug."
24269,bartlet,Was there a stowaway in the car? A monster? 
24270,bartlet,I got him! I got him! Come with me.
24275,c.j.,We have a hostage situation?
24276,bartlet,You and I have a very serious job to do tonight.
24280,bartlet,You sure do.  You talk to State?
24281,c.j.,I just heard myself. I was... there's a problem at the DEA.
24283,bartlet,"Five minutes ago, we were having a quiet morning. I got to take a look.  I'll catch up with you in a few minutes. We've got all sorts of good  stuff planned."
24285,bartlet,So they threw the whole lot of them in jail.
24287,c.j.,"Sir, did you talk to the DEA yesterday?"
24288,bartlet,No. Did State tell you about this Richter thing?
24289,bartlet,"Well, this blew up good and fast, didn't it?"
24290,josh,State's treating it like any other foreign arrest. There'll be a  consular visit and a trial. Richter isn't satisfied with that.
24291,c.j.,Sudanese jail. You gotta hope someone back home's making noise.
24292,bartlet,Were they proselytizing?
24293,josh,"We don't know. Richter says no. He spoke to a junior officer at the  Sudan desk, thinks they're blowing it off so he's trying to bump it up  the ladder."
24294,c.j.,"""Hostage"" is a big word. Particularly at Christmas."
24295,bartlet,All right. Let's get him in here. What about the DEA?
24296,c.j.,The DEA's coming down on a doctor in Oregon for assisting on a suicide.  There's no federal jurisdiction. I don't know what they think they're  doing.
24298,c.j.,They're calling it a violation of the Controlled Substances Act. The  narcotic he used is federally controlled.
24301,toby,Doesn't turn a shooting into a federal case.
24303,bartlet,We're sure this wasn't an accident? Pay management gone awry?
24304,c.j.,The doctor's not hiding his intentions. The state of Oregon says it's  legal. He was assisting a terminal patient to hasten the end of her  suffering.
24306,c.j.,"Well, yes, in Oregon, it is."
24307,bartlet,When's your next briefing?
24308,c.j.,An hour. I was going to go...
24309,toby,I don't think we comment. It's DOJ's mess. We don't want it.
24310,c.j.,We don't want a lot of things.
24311,toby,"For four years it's been, ""The President does not personally support  physician assisted suicide but believes it's not a federal issue and  should be resolved by the voters."""
24312,bartlet,State by state. And not by the Drug Enforcement Administration.
24313,toby,We don't jump into the middle of a bar fight and declare our intention  not to act. Let the Attorney General handle it.
24317,bartlet,"Debbie, where are they?"
24319,josh,Talk to Debbie. We need a sit-down for Congressman Donald Richter today.  And get him on the phone.
24322,josh,How come he's not with his in-laws?
24324,josh,Why's a five-year-old want to meet the Three Tenors?
24327,josh,He's a perfectly nice guy.
24328,c.j.,Speak slowly. You don't want to lose him.
24329,josh,Check it out! They're decking the halls.
24333,josh,That's government property. I'm gonna have to call the Feds.
24335,josh,You guys here for a couple days?
24338,josh,Yeah. I mean-- yeah. What's...?
24340,josh,That's great. I mean not the-- But we'll have a good shot at the seat.
24355,toby,Fire him. We hired him.
24357,c.j.,"""No comment"" is not gonna play."
24358,toby,How about we let the VP be the front man?
24360,toby,We're staring a State of the Union in the face. This is what hijacks the  agenda for weeks at a time.  This is what we talked about.
24361,c.j.,"What, do you need me to leave the room?"
24363,c.j.,The agenda. That's great.
24364,toby,"And if I'm doing it, I'm doing it. This is not on the agenda."
24369,c.j.,Thanks for the heads up.
24372,c.j.,No. Can you maybe handle that?
24373,c.j.,I've got a meeting. Could you tell her?
24375,bartlet,"Congressman, you start saying ""hostages,"" things get a little out of  hand."
24378,bartlet,"They're not gonna do that. Ted spoke with the families, let them know  we're waiting on a report from the consular officer. You gotta let it go  through channels."
24379,bartlet,We don't arbitrate. We can't. Not in 193 countries with as many legal  systems.
24380,c.j.,"We're expecting about 6,000 people. We're gonna switch on the lights,  then there will be performances by the United States Marine band and the  Louisiana Bayou Gospel Choir. And there's gonna be a troop of dancing  snowmen. Men, really, dressed as snowmen. Not as scary as it sounds.  Though probably deeply humiliating for the men. "
24381,c.j.,No? Snowmen?  Your mom's gonna be right back. And your grandpa  will be rolling in here any second now.
24382,c.j.,So what did you think of the Three Tenors?
24383,bartlet,Is Dr. McNally in her office?
24386,bartlet,He'll be fine. Ellie can show him. She did it one year in New Hampshire.  Ellie's not here yet?
24387,bartlet,All right. Push the rehearsal. I need to stop at Nancy McNally's. Is  Ellie even coming?
24388,bartlet,One would never know that the leaders of powerful nations respond to my  call on a moment's notice.
24389,toby,Russell's speaking to the American Nursing Association this week?
24391,toby,We'd like him to do a speech insert.
24393,toby,It's gonna come up in Q&A anyway. Might as well nip it in the bud.
24395,toby,We're trying to make sure you can move to Oregon and kill yourself.
24397,toby,We need to place some distance between the President and...
24399,toby,"The AG's back-dooring this on a technicality. We're gonna wait till the  courts knock it down, which they will. Meanwhile, he's usurping the  policy prerogative of the President. We need somebody to remind the  public it wasn't our decision."
24401,toby,We didn't ask you to groom Russell for a Presidential run. He asked you.
24403,toby,He was chosen by the Republicans!
24405,toby,I'm sorry. I'm sure you're gonna pull a great Eliza Doolittle here.
24407,toby,"Meanwhile, if the Vice President would be so kind, in between campaign  stops, could he do the President this favor?"
24410,josh,That's three weeks away.
24412,josh,There's plenty of time.
24416,josh,I like the polar fleece stuff.
24421,josh,Zoey. Wow! You look fantastic.
24428,josh,"Am I still on congressional recruitment, or is Angela gonna take that?"
24430,josh,"I don't care. It's just starting, so..."
24432,josh,Yeah. A nice young guy from New Hampshire wants to run for Campbell's  seat. Married to the boss's daughter.
24433,bartlet,"From New Hampshire? The U.S. Congress, not the state legislature? "
24435,bartlet,And he wants an endorsement?
24436,josh,I spoke to the county chair and the D triple C. They have some doubts.
24438,bartlet,They were in a nose dive. I know he tried to pull them out.
24441,josh,"Even with our endorsement, he may not make it to the primary."
24444,josh,"I can talk to him, sir."
24448,toby,I asked you what? Ten minutes ago?
24450,toby,"You found him, brought it up, carefully considered, then decided I can  go stuff it?"
24452,toby,Did you even take it to him? Or just walk around the block and come  back with your 'no'?
24454,toby, I should've sent a card.
24456,toby,"I know who you are. You're the guy we pulled out of Botox Babylon out  there, brought to work for the President."
24458,toby,"No, you certainly don't."
24459,toby,The President will take it to the Vice President.
24461,c.j.,"Did you see the clips Carol dropped off? The Jackson Clarion-Ledger  says, ""Attorney General Cracks Down On Doc Peddling Death."""
24463,c.j.,"Nobody but the locals in Oregon had picked it up yet, except the Jackson  Clarion-Ledger."
24465,c.j.,"Home of the steamboat, the mud pie, and Attorney General Alan Fisk. He's  talked about running for governor."
24467,c.j., Is the Vice President going to...?
24469,c.j.,'Cause I've been thinking maybe it's time we get back into this.
24470,toby,We thought it through the first time.
24472,toby,And Oregon hasn't worked out all the kinks.
24473,c.j.,The number of suicides among the terminally ill has gone down since they  passed it.
24474,toby,A policy of non-intervention...
24475,c.j.,...is a little lame when there's a 14th amendment violation in the  offing.
24476,toby,"We have no Constitutional right to die. Refuse treatment, yeah, but..."
24477,c.j.,"The framers never considered the notion of degenerative death, an event  which is entirely the creation of modern medicine. We have a right not  to reach the end of life in unendurable suffering and agony."
24478,toby,We're not stopping anybody from squirreling away 50 Seconal in a  nightstand and washing it down with a bottle of vodka.
24479,c.j.,"In order to down the 50 Seconal, you have to have control of both the  muscles in the hand and the muscles of the esophagus. This is an  opportunity, and we're dodging it."
24481,c.j.,He's in the hospital. I don't know. I don't know... if he knows the  difference.
24483,josh,"That's great. So, New Hampshire, First District."
24484,josh,You know a guy named Mitchell Clark?
24485,josh,The DNC seems to think he's got a chance for Campbell's seat.
24486,josh,"No question. We have a shot, but the party, they're... reticent..."
24487,josh,That could be part of it.
24488,josh,What about state legislature? It's the place to learn. The President  started there...
24493,toby,I was hoping you could speak to the Vice President. Ask him to do some  talking for us on the right-to-die situation.
24494,bartlet,Yeah. He said Will brought it up.
24495,toby,You already discussed it?
24496,bartlet,"That's not gonna work. Leo's hoping the Attorney General will back down.  If not, C.J. puts it in the Christmas Eve briefing, restates our  position, it's gone by Boxing Day."
24497,toby,"We just had a huge victory, and we're looking at a month of Christmas  carols, and the official ornament from the State of South Dakota. The  press is itching for a story with blood in it..."
24498,bartlet,The court will stop him. There's no way...
24499,toby,One in five patients requesting aid in dying has MS. One in five. Do you  know what the questions sound like?
24500,bartlet,I've got a pretty good idea.
24501,toby,"""How long does the President think he has before his MS will become  debilitating?"" ""Do the doctors anticipate a speedy decline?"" ""Does he  have a plan?"" ""Does the First Lady have four glass vials and a syringe  in a lock box in the night stand?"""
24502,bartlet, She may chicken out. Maybe I'll call you.
24503,toby,"That's the conversation, sir. It won't be Controlled Substances Act, or  federal overreaching, or anything else. I don't think we're ready to  have that conversation with the American public."
24507,josh,"He did, you know. He really did."
24510,josh,I'm not sure he got it.
24514,josh,I think he thinks he's still running.
24516,josh,He took it more like a cautionary tale than an actual...
24518,josh,"He's resilient, which isn't a very bad thing in a candidate."
24524,c.j.,Liz and Gus are running a little behind schedule. Can we push this to  four?
24526,bartlet,I'm waiting for my daughter and her son to arrive so we can practice the  ceremonial flipping of a switch.
24528,bartlet,"He had a Fisher-Price gizmo hooked to the side of this crib with more  cranks and levers than a DC-10, but we're gonna practice with the  switch."
24530,bartlet,You think Fisk is feeding it to them? I want him in here first thing  tomorrow.
24532,bartlet, The NGO know about this?
24534,bartlet,So they're undercover agents?
24536,bartlet,"18 Bibles. They couldn't have just talked about loving, kindness and  good will towards men? I just had Berryhill call the prime minister of  Sudan and issue a stern reprimand for behavior that I likened to street  gangs and petty thieves. We need to issue an apology."
24538,bartlet,But they know what's going on.
24542,bartlet,"Toby asked me today if I have a plan for my death. Liz has never asked.  Zoey. I understand Ellie asked her mother once, but I'm not supposed to  know about it. I get Toby."
24543,bartlet,Are we expecting Liz and Gus?
24544,bartlet,"Nancy McNally is waiting, and she's already had her bath."
24545,bartlet, Josh talk to Doug yet?
24551,bartlet,3.2 billion men in the world. She picks him.
24552,bartlet,"When he was 19, sure. She dumped a Rhodes scholar for this guy. Zoey  left Charlie for the Frog. Ellie and the guitar player with the purple  van. My children choose morons. Every one."
24553,bartlet,"You know, 15 years ago, we took a trip to Egypt, all five of us, saw the  pyramids and Luxor, then headed up into the Sinai. We had a guide, a  Bedouin man, who called me ""Abu el Banat."" Whenever we'd meet another  Bedouin, he'd introduce me as ""Abu el Banat."" The Bedouin would laugh  and laugh and then offer me a cup of tea. And I'd go and pay them for  the tea, and they wouldn't let me. ""Abu el Banat"" means ""father of  daughters."" They thought the tea was the least they could do."
24555,c.j.,"Does he know we've heard ""The Twelve Days of Christmas"" twice?"
24558,c.j.,"7,000 people standing in the cold, sir, you have to go turn on the  lights."
24561,bartlet," Len, this gonna be okay?"
24562,bartlet, It's cold out there. You got a coat?
24568,josh,Yeah. How'd it go with the tree?
24569,josh,"Okay, um... the conversation we had earlier. I think I wasn't clear."
24570,josh,We're asking you not to run.
24571,josh,The DNC. The White House.
24572,josh,"If you want to go forward on your own, the White House can't endorse  you."
24573,josh,The New Hampshire House is a great place to get some experience. Build  a network...
24574,josh,Hal Collins is... You met with Hal?
24577,bartlet,He shouldn't be upset. He'll light the tree next year. 
24580,bartlet,Why didn't we eat earlier?
24582,bartlet,Isn't there some kind of person...?
24583,bartlet,I thought that's exactly what a nanny was.
24585,bartlet,"Would you like to call him up and tell him we're waiting, and he can  leave the child in the confident care of the chinless Swede?"
24591,bartlet,We have yet to determine if medical science can spare Ellie Bartlet for  an evening.
24597,bartlet,Did you want to sit? We have room.
24603,bartlet, Five minutes. Ellie's still not here. I'll beat her  back.
24606,bartlet,Two more doctors? You couldn't wait a year to start campaigning?
24607,bartlet,You don't run for governor from my Cabinet.
24608,bartlet,"""The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution are  reserved to the states respectively."""
24609,bartlet,"Yes. When is it allowing the state to decide, not families? We'll just  start knocking off the weak and the indigent along with the sick and  dying. When does my administration completely deteriorate into the Third  Reich?"
24610,bartlet,"The federal government has no place here. The question is a moral one,  an individual one. Grappling with the nature of life and the purview of  God, in which the federal government has no... Forget it. Do what you  want. The courts are gonna nail you. You're counting on my silence, and  you've just lost it. "
24611,bartlet,"Yeah, I didn't want to get on T.V. with Oprah and talk about who's gonna  cut my meat when the coordination goes, but c'est la vie. The lid's off.  You pull this crap one more time, you're fired. Tell Janet Merry  Christmas."
24612,bartlet,There's a guy named Mitch Clark. DNC's been...
24613,bartlet,"The district's splitting right, much more than in my day."
24615,bartlet,"He went to Josh. He didn't come to me. If he wanted my advice, or if you  did, for that matter...  Doug didn't call Hal Collins. You did.  You recruited the finance committee."
24616,bartlet,"""The Speaker can convince most people of most things and himself of  almost anything."" Doug came up with that?"
24617,bartlet,He's a great guy and a fantastic father. You're the politician. Why the  hell don't you run?
24620,bartlet,"There's no question we missed things. We all made sacrifices, but  Elizabeth, when Annie and Gus watch you walk onto the floor of the U.S.  House of Representatives..."
24621,bartlet,Then why would you let Doug?
24626,josh,You picked your own gift?
24630,josh,I saw it Thanksgiving. I got it.
24634,josh,Really? It's a gift certificate. Tower Records. 'Cause you're a fan of  the music. You get to go on a spree.
24636,josh, So that's why I need to sit with Approps and find some foreign  aid money we can reprogram.
24638,josh,Bribing a dictator to get illegal missionaries out of Sudan.
24640,josh,Reassigning funds from extant authorizations based on new priorities in  East Africa.
24642,josh,"Donna, it's not a gift certificate."
24648,josh,I'm not telling you. Live with the pain.
24650,bartlet,I'm waiting. There's a fruit bowl. Turns out the fruit's real.
24652,bartlet,Ellie's here? That's nice. She enjoying her stay?
24654,bartlet,I'm not sure we're gonna see her for dinner. It's okay. I got a picture  in my wallet of the three girls together from Acadia in '96.
24658,bartlet,That and the cauliflower incident.
24660,bartlet,There's still time. Shame about Gus and the tree.
24662,bartlet,I did. He would have had fun.
24664,bartlet,"Oh, yeah. Last Christmas, Ellie wasn't around. The year before was  Tennessee and the calls to Belarus. I can't remember when it was just  the five of us and weather and everybody in their slippers."
24668,bartlet,"I'm putting together a panel on assisted suicide. If you got any names,  medical ethicists."
24670,bartlet, Uh-uh... No syringe in the nightstand. It'll get  ugly and that's that... You gonna be there?
24674,c.j.,"He's not a fan of turkey. I was told he didn't eat any of it... Yes.  Talmidge Cregg. The other night nurse... Right. We spoke the day after  Thanksgiving... It's fine. I just thought maybe I could send a ham...  No, I'm not asking the kitchen to do it. I'm saying It's three weeks  away. They vacuum pack it. If I could just send it to you, and you could  see that they give it to him instead of... No, this is... I'm... This is  C.J. I'm-I'm his daughter."
24685,josh,What are you talking about?
24687,josh, When did... When did this get on the schedule?
24689,josh,"No, it hasn't, it just... There isn't anybody else who can do this?"
24693,josh,"No, I can't work in the office! "
24694,josh,"We've crashed five times in the last three weeks. When I'm not being evacuated  from the building, I'm not being allowed to leave the building and now, the one...  God, Donna, I wanna go home."
24696,josh," All right, I'll give them a few minutes, but then I gotta go, ok?"
24698,josh, When am I supposed to do this?
24702,josh,Good evening! Good to see you... you're the group from Presidential... something?
24706,josh,"So, how'd you all get here?"
24708,josh,"All right, I'm Josh Lyman, I'm the Deputy White House Chief of Staff, I joined the  Bartlet campaign shortly before the Iowa Caucus, then served as the campaign's  political director. Before that, I worked with then Senator John Hoynes for a while..."
24711,josh," All right, listen, something's about to happen. Don't let it frighten you,  they need to seal the building."
24712,josh,"Yeah, I guess they are.  Something's happened."
24716,josh,"Would you call Leo's office and find out what's going on, and, more important,  how long it's going to be going on for?"
24718,josh,"Yeah, I'll definitely give that a try. "
24719,josh,"Okay, well, uh, this is called a ""crash."" It means there's been some kind of  security breach and no one's allowed in or out of the building. "
24720,josh,Would you call Leo's office? 
24721,josh,"So, I guess we should use this time. Uh, this is the White House, the home of the  President and the Executive Branch, the most powerful of the three branches of  the federal government. "
24724,josh,"I'll call you Fred. A little knowledge can be a dangerous thing. I don't know how long  we're all going to be here, but you just made my list. "
24725,josh,"Yes, I suppose, technically, constitutionally the Legislative Branch is the most  powerful, but we get a motorcade, so back off. All right, you already know about the  branches of government, I assume you know how a bill becomes a law. What do you want  to talk about? "
24726,josh,"Guys, seriously, it's nothing to worry about. We've been having these crashes once a week.  Let's go. Somebody ask me something."
24727,josh,"Well... it's not everybody, and they're trying to kill you, too."
24728,josh,"No, both of us the same. Let's go, it doesn't have to be about politics. You're off  to college. I'm the guy who knows what you need to know. Sophomore year, my roommates  and I got a fish registered for 18 credits, and she made Dean's List. My roommates and  I made a Dean's List of a different sort, but that doesn't matter."
24729,josh,"No. I mean, we're bystanders, basically, and we work around a lot of people who  routinely put themselves in harm's way-the Secret Service and the military.  You know, the protection detail? They practice a thousand different scenarios  for a gun: who tackles the president, who opens the car, who's covering the  perimeter, and there's one guy whose job it is to stand in front of the bullet.  Not get the shooter-stand in front of the bullet. I've seen him do it."
24730,josh,"No.  Well... my, uh... my mother wants me to.  My family members have a habit of, uh, dying before you're supposed too. So it's  just me and my mom now and... You guys know I guess, that I got accidentally shot  a little bit or something at Rosslyn. So, she'd like to see me in the private sector.  But I tell her my government salary may not be a lot, but I still make more than  the guy whose job it is to stand in front of the bullet, so how do I tell him I'm  quitting? So she made me this box that I'm supposed to keep in the trunk of my car,  and it's got a super-powered flashlight, five gallons of water, and a transistor  radio, and some first aid. But she keeps thinking of things to add to it. She'll  call and say, uh, ""I found that cap that Dad got Joe Pepitone to sign for you on  your birthday. You wore it to school every day in the seventh grade. You want me  to send it to you so you can put it in the box?"" "
24731,josh,"So... I'll say ""Yeah, Ma, let's put it in the box."" "
24732,josh,"So anyway, I... I don't know against who, and I don't know what it's going to look like,  but one of these days we're gonna have a big win, and for a lot of us who've seen what  we've seen, we're not leaving till we do. I'm gonna be here six presidents from now,  in my office, Wile E. Coyote and a map."
24734,josh,It's not Arabs. It's not Islamics.  They're juniors and seniors? 
24736,josh,"You're juniors and seniors.   In honor of the SAT's you're about to take, answer the following question. "
24737,josh,"Thanks. Islamic extremist is to Islamic as ""blank"" is to Christianity. "
24738,josh,"Islamic... extremist... is to... Islamic... as... ""blank"" is... to Christianity."
24740,josh,"No. Guys, the Christian right may not be your cup of tea, but they're not blowing  stuff up. ""Islamic extremist is to Islamic as ""blank is to Christianity."" "
24741,josh,"That's what we're talking about. It's the Klan, gone medieval and global. It couldn't  have less to do with Islamic men and women of faith of whom there are millions upon  millions. Muslims defend this country in the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps,  National guard, police and fire departments. So, let's ask the question again."
24742,josh,That's a reasonable question if ever I heard one. Why are we targets of war? 
24745,josh,"I'll tell you, right or wrong-and I think they're wrong-it's probably a good idea to  acknowledge that they do have specific complaints. I-I hear them every day-the people  we support, troops in Saudi Arabia, sanctions against Iraq, support for Egypt.  It's not just that they don't like Irving Berlin."
24749,josh,You just called me ridiculous twice in one sentence. 
24751,josh,And you just made my list.
24753,josh,"It's a serious list. But she does have a point, albeit college girlish."
24755,josh,"Hardly a record for me. What's Islamic extremism? It's strict adherence to a particular  interpretation of 7th century Islamic law as practiced by the prophet Mohammed, and  when I say ""strict adherence,"" I'm not kidding around. Men are forced to pray, wear  their beards a certain length. Among my favorites is there's only one acceptable cheer  at a soccer match: Allah-uh-Akbar-God is great. If your guys are getting creamed,  then you're on your own. Things are a lot less comic for women, who aren't allowed  to attend school or have jobs. They're not allowed to be unaccompanied, and oftentimes  get publicly stoned to death for crimes like not wearing a veil. I don't have to tell  you they don't need to shout at a soccer match because they're never going to go to one.  So what bothers them about us? Well, the variety of cheers alone coming from the cheap  seats at Giants stadium when they're playing the Cowboys is enough for a jihad, to say  nothing of street corners lined church next to synagogue, next to mosque, newspapers  that can print anything they want, women who can do anything they want including taking  a rocket ship to outer space, vote, and play soccer. This is a plural society. That  means we accept more than one idea. It offends them. So yes, she does have a point,  but that certainly doesn't mean you should listen to her."
24757,josh,"Well, I think for help with that question we're going to need some people smarter than I am."
24759,josh,"Thing is... that's pretty tough to find. But I'm going to go upstairs and see if I can  get some of my friends to come down and join us. Listen, I-I don't know what's going on  and I don't know how long we're going to be here. Are you guys hungry?"
24760,josh,"Freddy, why don't you grab a couple of people, go to the back of the kitchen, get apples  and peanut butter? Guys, I've gotten entire pieces of legislation through Congress on  apples and peanut butter. I'll be back in a little bit."
24765,toby,"No, no. I mean everyone. You're all bothering me. I want to be left alone. Clearly, the only  way that's gonna happen is to be alone. So I'm sorry, but I'm gonna have to let you all go.   Except the Yankees and the Knicks... and the Yankees and the Knicks are gonna need  someone to play, so keep the Red Sox and the Lakers... and the Laker girls, and The Palm,  and we'll need to keep the people who work at The Palm. That's it though. The Yankees, the  Red Sox, the Knicks, the Lakers, the Laker girls, and anyone who works at The Palm. Sports,  Laker girls, and a well-prepared steak. That's all I need... Sometimes, I like to mix it up  with Italian... and Chinese. All right, you can all stay, but don't bug me. You're on  probation. Don't forget. I was this close to banishing you."
24766,josh,"This is Toby Ziegler, and actually, he's in charge of crafting our message to the public."
24767,toby,"And today, that message is?"
24769,toby,"My choice, sister. And by the way, there's nothing wrong with a religion whose laws say a  man's got to wear a beard or cover his head or wear a collar. It's when violation of these  laws become a crime against the State and not your parents that we're talking about lack of  choice.  ""Islamic Extremists is to Islamic as KKK is to  Christianity."" That's... that's about right. That's a good religious analogy. What's the  political analogy? What's an analogy using governments?"
24770,toby,The Taliban is not the recognized government of Afghanistan. The Taliban took over the  recognized government of Afghanistan. And there's your political analogy.
24771,toby,"When you think of Afghanistan, think of Poland. When you think of the Taliban, think of the  Nazis. When you think of the citizens of Afghanistan, think of the Jews in concentration camps.  A friend of my dad's was at one of the camps. He used to come over to the house, and he and  my dad used to shoot some pinochle. He said he once saw a guy at the camp kneeling and praying.  He said, ""What are you doing?"" The guy said he was thanking God. And my dad's friend said,  ""What could you possibly be thanking God for?"" He said, ""I'm thanking God for not making me  like them."" Bad people can't be recognized on sight. There's no point in trying."
24772,josh,"Actually, we already covered that."
24773,toby,"It's worth covering twice, don't you agree?"
24776,toby," Yeah, I've changed my mind again. Kill them all."
24779,toby, What was the first act of terrorism?
24780,josh,"I could answer, but I think he's asking you, man."
24781,toby," secret followers of Al-hassan Ibn-al-Sabbah,  who were taught to believe in nothing and dare all, carried out these very swift and very  treacherous murders of fellow Muslims, and they did it in the state of religious ecstasy."
24783,josh,"This is Sam Seaborn, Deputy Communications Director. Now, don't be frightened when I tell you  that in this room, Sam is the knowledgeable terrorism expert. The good news is in this  government, we have some extremely knowledgeable terrorism experts."
24785,toby,"We were talking about Al-, am I pronouncing this right? Al-Hassan Ibn-al-Sabbah?"
24790,josh,"Yeah, we don't call on him."
24793,toby,"I had a 6:00 on the Hill, now I'm stuck here, you know, talking with well-dressed children  who can't vote."
24816,josh,"No, no, no, no. You walked into quicksand."
24817,toby,You don't talk to C.J. about the CIA.
24819,josh,C.J. has a bizarre affection for the intelligence community that we just don't...
24820,c.j.,Bizarre? How about right?
24822,c.j.,"This song is called, ""The CIA, Our Maligned Little Brother."""
24824,c.j.,"We need spies; human spies. Spy satellites are great if you're trying to detect  whether or not Kruschev's put missiles in Cuba. But if you want to overhear a  conversation over Turkish coffee in Khyber Pass, you need a spy. You guys want to  great a great job after college and serve your country? Study Arabic, Chinese and Farsi."
24825,toby,"Maybe this'd be a good time for a chorus of ""Our Maligned Little Brother, Civil Liberties."""
24826,c.j.,"Liberties, schmiberties."
24827,toby,"C.J. Cregg, ladies and gentlemen."
24828,c.j.,You know the way to do this without tapping some phones?
24829,toby,What about illegal searches? What about profiling? Do you know what Benjamin Franklin said?
24830,c.j.,"He said, ""Hey, look, I've invented the stove."""
24833,c.j.,"Well, I don't think we're talking a little temporary safety and it's not like we need to  search high and low for clear and present danger."
24834,toby,"Well, what would you say the point of fighting terrorism is?"
24835,c.j.,"It's to insure freedom, Pokey. I don't need the brochure."
24836,toby,"I think you do cause during times of great crisis and threat, America has used Draconian  measures before and I think maybe you've forgotten just how affective they've been.  Can you name some?"
24837,toby, I want her to name them.
24840,c.j.,"Look, I talk civil liberties as seriously as anybody, okay? I've been to the dinners  and we haven't even talked about free speech yet and somebody getting lynched by the  patriotism police for voicing a minority opinion. That said, Tobus, we're going to  have to do some stuff. We're going to have to tap some phones and we're going to have  to partner with some people who are the lesser of evils. I'm sorry but terrorists don't  have armies and navies. They don't have capitals. Some of these guys we're going to have  to walk up to them and shoot them. Yeah, we can root terrorist nests but some of these  guys aren't going to be taken by the 105thn armored tank division. Some of these guys  are going to be taken by a busboy with a silencer. So it's time to give the intelligence  agencies the money and the manpower they need. We don't hear about their successes.  Guess what? The Soviets never crossed the Elbe. The North Koreans stayed behind the  38th parallel. During the Millennium? Not one incident. Do you think that's because  the terrorists decided that'd be a good day to take off? Not much action that day?  End of song."
24851,c.j.,There's nothing more American than coalition-building. The first thing John Wayne  always did was put together a posse.
24852,josh,"That's a hell of an example, C.J."
24853,c.j.,Shouldn't you be finding ways to provide aid and comfort for our boys in intelligence?
24854,josh,"You know, they may need some comforting right now. When this crash is over, you'd best  get in some fishnets and head to a bar."
24857,josh,Where do they come from?
24860,bartlet, What the hell's going on?
24861,c.j.,"Sir, this is a group of high school students from Presidential Classroom."
24863,bartlet,You women seem bright and lovely. The men? Disturbingly dense.
24865,bartlet,Excuse me...  Weren't you coming down to get me some apples and peanut butter?
24866,bartlet," So, we're stuck here, huh?"
24868,bartlet, I'm going back to my office. Nice meeting you all.
24872,bartlet," A martyr would rather suffer death at the hands of  an oppressor than renounce his beliefs. Killing yourself and innocent people to make  a point is sick, twisted, brutal, dumb-ass murder. And let me leave you with this  thought before I go searching for the apples that were rightfully mine: we don't need  martyrs right now. We need heroes. A hero would die for his country but he'd much  rather live for it... It was good meeting you all."
24873,c.j.,"Thank you, Mr. President."
24878,josh,I think most people also find it important to remember that the whole thing took place  about 73 million years ago.
24882,josh,"Well, all right. That's it then."
24885,josh,You don't have the choices in a war that you do in a jury room. But I - I - I wish...  wish we didn't have to. I think death is too simple.
24886,josh,"I'd put 'em in a small cell, and make them watch home movies of the birthdays and baptisms  and weddings of every single person they killed, over and over, every day, for the rest  of their lives.   Not so much you, Fred."
24887,josh,"Learn things. Be good to each other. Read the newspapers, go the movies, go to a party.  Read a book. In the meantime, remember pluralism. You want to get these people? I mean,  you really want to reach in and kill them where they live? Keep accepting more than one  idea. Makes 'em absolutely crazy."
24890,josh,Thank you. Thanks a lot. It was fun. Don't steal anything on the way out. Okay.
24892,josh,"Nothing, just...just keep doing what you're doing."
24901,c.j.,"Tomorrow morning, the President will direct the Attorney General to appoint a Special  Prosecutor, yes.  I... I can't see! Joan?"
24902,c.j.,"A list of three prosecutors is given to a three judge panel. The prosecutors, as well  as the judges, were all appointed by Republican Presidents."
24904,c.j.,"I can't comment on a witness list that doesn't exist, I imagine subpoenas will be issued  to most senior White House staff, including myself."
24907,c.j.,"Again, I can't comment on what kind of hearing Congress has in mind; I'm sure there'll  be one, but you'll have to talk to Congress.  Okay, here now, the  President of the United States. "
24908,c.j.,"Front row, on your right."
24910,bartlet,"I'm sorry, Sandy, there was a little bit of noise there, can you repeat the question?"
24911,bartlet, Yeah. And I'm going to win.
24913,c.j.,"Oh, yeah, thank you, thanks. "
24919,c.j.,"The FDA is an independent agency, I could get in trouble for even knowing what you just  told me."
24920,c.j.,"Well, I'll be asking one of my 14 lawyers about that. When are they going to announce?"
24923,josh,C.J.! There are now seven different drafts of the speech.
24925,josh,"The President likes none of them. Toby and Doug can't get together, Sam and Doug can't  get together. Leo and Bruno can't get together."
24926,c.j.,"Listen, I've got to talk to you for a second."
24927,josh,"If anyone asks, the speech is done, they're just ironing it a bit..."
24928,c.j.,That's what I've been saying. Listen. 
24931,c.j.,Paulson got it from a source the FDA is signing off on RU-486.
24932,josh,When are they going to announce?
24935,c.j.,Right before the speech.
24936,josh,You didn't take care of this?
24939,c.j.,I told all departments no news on Monday. We get the cycle to ourselves. 
24941,c.j.,The FDA is an independent agency.
24942,josh,So we're kicking off our campaign on the same day...
24945,c.j.,"Look, I'm sorry, but..."
24946,josh,"Yeah, I'm also not wild about pictures of the President getting on the plane without his  wife."
24947,c.j.,I can't computer-generate images of the First Lady.
24948,josh,She's getting in in the morning?
24949,c.j.,We'll do some pictures.
24950,josh,I'm going to call Gail Trent and confirm this other thing.  Maybe we  want to postpone.
24952,josh, I don't know. He's got laryngitis or something.
24953,c.j.,"Listen, anybody asks - the speech is done, we're just putting on some..."
24955,c.j., I wouldn't worry about it.
24957,c.j.,"Yeah. Anybody asks - the speech is done, we're just putting finishing touches on."
24960,c.j.,"It's done, they're just ironing a few things out. "
24961,c.j.,"Everybody's getting along great, they're dotting the I's and crossing the T's."
24968,bartlet,"That's funny, 'cause that's sort of what I did."
24980,bartlet,"I'm running again, Abbey."
24982,bartlet,"Look, I have a lot to say..."
24986,bartlet,"No, I have to go down, they're going to brief me on the evacuation plan for Haiti."
24990,bartlet,Probably three or four.
24996,josh,The motorcade left without me. I had to drive back with Ed and Larry.
24998,josh,"Not faster than the Presidential motorcade, no.  Uh, set up a conference call so Cabinet Affairs can  brief."
25000,josh,Yeah. I need congressional leaders.  
25006,josh,"Set up the calls, would you? "
25008,toby,"Leo's got to... uh, cancel everything on the public schedule tomorrow."
25010,toby,You are talking with Cabinet Affairs?
25011,josh,Donna is setting up the call. Why aren't you smiling?
25013,josh,I'm wet and I'm smiling.
25014,toby,I'm smiling on the inside. Ginger?
25015,toby,"Public Liaison wrote up talking points two hours ago. Pull them, they're no good anymore.  "
25019,toby," Fifteen minutes! Sam, we've got to..."
25021,toby,"Okay, let's try not to do that a lot. "
25027,toby, And we need Oliver Babish.
25028,josh,You want to put him in the Briefing Room tomorrow?
25029,toby,Send a message we're not worried about the legal side.
25030,bartlet, What are you all looking at?
25031,toby,"Good evening, Mr. President."
25032,bartlet,What do you guys think the news is going to lead with tomorrow?
25037,toby,All right. Don't worry about Haiti. Let's do what we have to. 
25043,bartlet,"So these helicopters land on the roof, and then..."
25044,bartlet,What are the possibilities there'll be Haitian civilian casualties?
25063,c.j.,Sit down. We're landing.
25064,josh,I talked to Gail Trent.
25066,josh,And she confirmed it. The FDA's going to announce.
25068,josh,Yeah. What are they talking about back there?
25071,c.j.,The lack of yeast in our numbers. Yeast is a fun word to say.
25072,josh,I'm sorry I got in your face before.
25073,c.j.,Our numbers are less than yeasty.
25075,toby,We need a new poll in the field right now.
25078,josh,Because the first one was bogus.
25080,c.j.,"1,170 voters in one industrial state isn't representative of the whole country."
25081,josh,"Plus, people respond differently to voting out the governor versus a sitting President."
25084,c.j.,So he has a bit of a shield to protect him from character attacks.
25086,c.j.,We need to put a poll in the field right now.
25087,toby,Than you all for coming around to the self-evident point I made five minutes ago.
25089,josh,"Mine, too. I got a ride with Larry and Ed."
25090,josh,I just thought you were happy.
25091,josh,Which one of us are you talking to?
25094,toby, This is a lot like DuPont Circle.
25095,josh,"We're there already, Jo."
25096,josh,Put a poll in the field.
25097,josh,The hotel's up on the right.
25099,josh,A pill that will abort a pregnancy up to 49 days.
25104,josh,"See, I think you're thinking that somehow this pill means more sex for you."
25106,josh,"Of course, you're for it. I'm for it. Everybody's for it. Just not on Monday."
25108,josh," A, it will get folded into our news cycle when we want it to ourselves.  B, it will give the pro-lifers something to scream about. And C, it'll look like the  campaign screwed up, so the press'll write a process story instead of writing about our  issues."
25110,josh,Not on Monday. I'm checking in. 
25111,toby,"M&Ms from Air Force One, Lois."
25114,toby,He's not going to apologize.
25117,toby,Don't talk about military strategy in a conversation like this.
25118,toby, You wanna speak up? I'm not sure the entire White  House Press Corps heard you.
25121,toby,Joey's putting a poll in the field first thing in the morning.
25123,toby,"Leo, Leo, we've been through this."
25140,c.j.,"Our hotel is located just a few miles from the site of John Goffe's mill.  ""Hunter John, as he was called, was granted the land as a reward for his  services to the colony in the French and Indian wars."" Let me tell you something. We  don't do that enough anymore."
25142,c.j.,"Yes.  ""Later in life, he built the water-powered grist mill with his son,  Colonel John Goffe, and his grandson, Major John Goffe."" The Goffes."
25144,c.j.,It's going to make us think he's up for challenges.
25149,c.j.,I don't know how to play pool.
25150,toby,Then you wanna play for money?
25153,c.j.,"I'm drawing inspiration from the strength of the Goffe family. The descendents of Hunter  John have been owners and operators of the Goffe Family Mill for more than two centuries  now.  ""In 1845, when Theodore `Ody' Goffe was the proprietor, the mill burned to  the ground."" Well, that totally blows."
25154,c.j.,"Again, I can tell you that the operation was launched from the deck of the USS  Enterprise, about 60 miles off the coast of Haiti. If you need more details about  troops and equipment, I'm going to have to refer you to the Pentagon."
25156,c.j.,His state of mind was he's commander in chief.
25157,c.j.,He'd been through a TV. interview and a press conference. The President finds you all  annoying but not prohibitively debilitating.
25159,c.j.,The President's MS isn't life threatening...
25163,c.j.,No. Leo McGarry told me.
25164,c.j.,Because Leo McGarry told me.
25165,c.j.,"Just good friends, Katie."
25166,josh,It's getting away from her a little.
25167,c.j., I'm not answering that.
25168,josh," Yeah. Listen, I wanted to ask you about something."
25169,josh,"The Justice Department wants another $30 million to fund its suit against the tobacco  companies and we want them to have it. The Appropriations Subcommittee on Justice, State  and Commerce handles that money and they won't bring it to a vote."
25170,josh,"Yeah. Now, I wanted to turn the heat up and issue a release."
25171,josh,Yeah. It calls them well-fed members lining their campaign war chests and being complicit  in hundreds of thousands of negligent homicide.
25172,josh,"We didn't send the release out yesterday because of the MS announcement and Mrs.  Landingham. But in a day or two, I wanna leak it. What do you think?"
25174,josh,I'm raising the profile to bring public opinion down on him. Play defense with that.
25177,c.j.,It's because I don't believe it has anything to do with the President's sharing his  health information with the general public.
25178,c.j., The Pentagon briefing's scheduled for 3 this afternoon. I'll keep you posted with  the changes.
25179,toby," Leo talked to me, you know."
25181,toby,I said Leo talked to me.
25186,c.j.," Strategically, I felt that was the wise thing  to do."
25187,toby,Leo talked to me. I know what you're thinking about doing.
25188,bartlet,We're talking about a display of force?
25189,bartlet,And what is he up against?
25190,josh,Isn't it possible they can shoot at us again?
25191,bartlet,It picks up weapons signals?
25192,bartlet," Peter, State's exploring the effectiveness of immediate sanctions?"
25193,josh,With terrible results that hurt the wrong people.
25194,bartlet,We'll have a refugee crisis.
25195,bartlet," All right, let's go here. Nancy, Peter, get a message to the Canadian prime  minister - we intend to restore Dessaline. The Canadians should tell Bazan if he doesn't  move out we're willing to move forward with military options. In the mean time, I'm  willing to consider a fly-by."
25196,bartlet,Now you're just bugging me.  That's all.
25199,josh,We should bear in mind that if we end up invading Haiti there'll be a belief...
25200,bartlet,That it was politically motivated.
25201,toby,Yeah. That at the... at the very least we welcomed the opportunity both to distract  attention from the MS story and show strength as commander in chief.
25202,bartlet,You think it's a sign of strength to invade Haiti? 
25204,bartlet,Missouri could invade Haiti.
25206,bartlet,"Sanctions aren't going to work - you said it yourself. The Haitian National Police will  get rich of the contraband. Dessaline was democratically elected and instead of sitting  in his office he's sitting on the USS Enterprise. To say nothing of the fact that they  shot at us, and you don't get to do that."
25210,josh,"You know, at some point we're going to have to check the First Lady's temperature."
25213,toby,"On Haiti, tell your people to be careful with public posture - not to say or do anything  that could taint any of the options."
25214,josh,Nobody wants to invade...
25215,toby,Nobody wants to contemplate invading until we've exhausted diplomatic options.
25220,toby,"""We can sit back and admit with grave sensitivity that life isn't fair and the  less-advantaged are destined to their lot in life and the problems of those on the  other side of the world should stay there, that our leaders are cynical and can never  be an instrument to change, but that, my friends, is not worthy of you, it's not worthy  of the President, it's not worthy of a great nation, it's not worthy of America!"" Paper's  for wimps. Wanna play?"
25221,toby,I understand it's because you're scared.
25222,toby,"I'm saying if you're a scared chicken, I understand."
25224,toby,I'll give you the break.
25225,toby,"Nice game, it was fun to watch."
25226,toby,Charlie... The President and the First Lady...
25229,toby,"No, you're right. You know what? Look, it's a typical marriage, I've been there."
25230,josh,"I said to you, I said this - I said: ""Do you want food?"""
25232,josh,"And you said, ""No, I don't want any food."""
25234,josh,"And now, you're eating my food."
25236,josh,Are you...eating the rest of the sandwich?
25240,josh,"I'm not sure you can say ""stomachs ache with the pain."""
25247,josh,I need to talk to you... The FDA's gonna approve RU-486.
25251,josh,"The source was non-governmental. Leo, they're doing it on Monday."
25253,josh,"As well as I can. I've been at it most of the night. I'd like to go through back  channels, see if I can hold 'em off."
25255,josh,Then I think we have to consider postponing the speech. 
25262,josh," ""Do you feel he's physically able to perform his duties as President?"""
25263,josh,What's the bottom line?
25266,josh,"All right, I'm gonna set up some meetings for tomorrow. We'll have the final numbers for  this set and we'll figure out where to go from here. Thanks everybody."
25275,josh,"Yeah, well, I don't know what to say."
25277,josh,Let me ask you something.
25279,josh,The release I wrote about the tobacco appropriations...
25281,josh,What would you think about my leaking it to the subcommittee? 
25286,c.j.,It's five F-18 fighters and an E-2 Hawkeye.
25288,c.j.,The President's expressed his gratitude and his concern to the Marines and their families.
25289,c.j.,"No, the President's health isn't a matter of concern. "
25290,c.j.,The conversation was focused on the Marines and their contribution to our national  security. 
25292,c.j.," Yeah, they're being considered economic refugees and diverted to  Guantanamo Bay. "
25296,c.j.,"Again, that's not a factor. "
25298,c.j.,"To be honest with you, Carl, I think the President's relieved to be focusing on something  that matters. "
25299,c.j.,"Obviously, what I meant to say was..."
25304,toby,I was standing right there. 
25308,c.j., Just... just don't say anything for a... just don't say anything for a.... 
25314,josh,"""Relieved""? The President's relieved to be focusing on Haiti?"
25316,josh,Isn't this exactly what we said we had to be careful of?
25318,josh,She was asked if the President's situation makes it harder for him to focus on Haiti. 
25320,josh,There was a ramp-up but she was asked...
25322,josh,She said the President's relieved to be focusing on something that matters.
25324,toby,We can argue that...uh...she just misspoke. 
25325,josh,She meant to say that the President realizes he's focusing on something that matters.
25326,toby,Or the President's reiterating that his focus is on something...
25328,toby,"She misspoke is all we need. We go back, we say that she misspoke."
25330,toby,She goes back. She says she was tired.
25343,bartlet,Awasiwi Odanack. It's a Abenaki phrase that means...
25345,bartlet," ...""beyond the village."""
25357,bartlet," Yeah, no, I mean, why?"
25359,bartlet,It'll get wrapped up in one news cycle. I don't give a...
25361,bartlet,"Screw it, and screw anybody who writes that story."
25365,bartlet,"Of course the first round of subpoenas'll be handed down this week. If we announce in two  weeks, that's when the first round of subpoenas will be handed down!  Screw it!  It's game time. Let's go!"
25369,bartlet,  How's everybody doing?
25372,bartlet,All right.  Laryngitis?
25374,bartlet,We could just say I have MS.
25378,bartlet,"I'm running for reelection, and I'm gonna win."
25379,bartlet," We are more than a set of borders. We are bounded by the reach of human  freedom. We have mastered every moment. We have vanquished every foe. We are strong.  We are prosperous. We are at peace with the world. We are, as we have ever been, the  envy of every civilization. We are, as we have ever been, the hope of all mankind. But  I am not satisfied. Indeed, I am restless. And I come before not to speak of the America  we have, but of the Amer...."
25382,toby,We are the envy of every civilization?
25385,toby,We know what he meant. Thank you.
25388,toby,(indicating Doug) Could somebody stick some pom-poms in that guy's hands?
25389,bartlet,"(reading) ""But I am not satisfied. Indeed, I am restless. And I come before you not to  speak of the America we have, but of the better, stronger, more prosperous America we  can create together."""
25390,c.j.,There's a snake over there. (All look.)
25392,c.j.,"I don't know and I don't want to ask him. Can somebody shoot it, please?"
25394,bartlet,It's a garter snake. Don't worry about it.
25396,bartlet,"(reading) ""I seek re-election to the presidency, not because of its glories, but because  of its challenges..."""
25400,toby,"Cause if it's all day at the beach, any bozo with a handshake can do it."
25401,josh,"(to Bartlet) It's true, sir. America does not want Dr. Kervorkian to lead the country.  We've got polling data on that."
25402,bartlet,All right. We'll revisit that.
25403,c.j.,The snake is looking at me now.
25404,bartlet,"(reading) ""A presidential candidate owes his campaign no less than he owes his country;  everything he has, everything he can give, all his hope..."
25407,josh,"Okay, I see the snake now, too."
25408,toby,"Sir, you're perfectly entitled to declare yourself the leader of the campaign and the  country, since, after all, you are."
25409,bartlet,(joking) Does somebody her have M.S. and they haven't said anything?
25410,josh,"Seriously, that's a pretty big snake."
25411,bartlet,"(reading) ""But I am not satisfied."" Indeed, Leo, I am close to taking my own life with  a wheat thresher."
25413,bartlet,"""And so with pride and purpose, I hereby announce my candidacy for the presidency of the  United States."""
25415,bartlet, I didn't see you there...
25419,bartlet,"Peter thinks sanctions are a waste of time and I agree. In about half an hour we're  buzzing the island with... uh, what they call an Alpha strike formation - to show  Bazan... I don't know. "
25422,bartlet," Sorry, I said I don't know, we'll see."
25424,bartlet,"Yeah, it was bound to happen. "
25430,bartlet," Yeah, it's Leo's call. Look, I'm sorry, I can't get into our thing tonight."
25432,bartlet,"I do, that's why I can't get into it. I have to read."
25434,bartlet,"All right, I'm going to the study. "
25436,bartlet," Abbey, you were lying down when I came in. I didn't see you."
25442,josh,He really doesn't... that much. Leo? Can I see you for a second?
25445,josh,The last thing we need is to come out of the gate waving a flag to the American  heartland...
25447,josh,...saying we don't share your values.
25453,josh,The FDA is a division of HHS and technically not an independent agency.
25455,josh,"I can keep the President away from this. I can call the FDA's chief of staff, I got  him his job... They can wait..."
25457,josh,Two weeks - to announce the drug. They don't have to do it on Monday. I can fix tobacco.
25465,c.j.,Ellie and Zoey are here?
25467,c.j.,"No, thank you, I can't. But I do want to talk to you about a photo-op."
25471,c.j.,"Okay. So, at any rate..."
25479,c.j.,"Ma'am, this is uncomfortable territory and obviously, I... The press has sources that  say that you and the President..."
25487,c.j.,I spoke to the First Lady. I thought it might not be a bad idea if there were some  opportunities with the two of them together at the house.
25489,c.j.,"Well, she denied me cider. "
25491,c.j.,I'll brief the Sunday papers on what they can expect from the speech on Monday.
25493,c.j.,I'm just giving them highlights.
25497,c.j.,I thought maybe you could speak to her. 
25501,c.j.,Every paper today had a picture on the front page of the President boarding Air Force One  to go home by himself.
25503,c.j.,There are any number of press questions about...
25505,c.j.,I'm not wild about the fact that you told Toby what we discussed.
25507,c.j.,When I think it's time...
25516,bartlet,"Well, that's a bit of a dilemma. Does anybody have room at their place for Bazan and  sixty of his relatives?"
25518,bartlet,"I want to handle this peacefully and right now. Nancy, what do you think of Venezuela?"
25519,bartlet,"Tell them I'll give the SPR strong consideration. Mike, have the Canadians get a message  through: we'll unfreeze his US accounts but he can't remove any money from Haiti. Only  his wife, his children and his parents can seek asylum. If he tries to go back, he'll be  under arrest."
25521,bartlet,Tell me when it's done.
25548,bartlet,"The State Department's suggesting that we praise the French government for their help  in resolving this matter. I would, but I'm worried they'd surrender."
25550,bartlet,When do you think C.J. can brief?
25557,c.j.,"Well, that story got a little drowned out."
25559,c.j.,I could have stood on top of the Sears Tower with a Stratacaster and that story would  have been drowned out!
25563,c.j.,It's too early for Bruno.
25565,c.j.,"Toby, Sam and Josh... the guys aren't gonna like it!"
25568,toby,I think Sam wants to take this one.
25572,toby,It's that kind of thinking that makes us the envy of every civilization.
25576,toby,It was a little damage control needed to be done.
25577,toby,A month ago 74 percent of them thought MS was fatal.
25578,toby," God, why the hell didn't I think of that?!"
25600,bartlet,I understand you're going to be working with us.
25601,bartlet,You have one or two demands.
25602,bartlet,You want 12 percent of the ad buys.
25603,bartlet,"A room, a car, and a driver, that's no problem."
25605,bartlet,"I'm sorry, Bruno. Leo runs the show."
25619,toby,Good. Whose throat do I shove these down? Whose skull do I crack with this sign?
25620,toby,"""Bartlet for President."""
25621,toby," Good, 'cause I was there when he won. I saw him get sworn in, I actually  rode in a limo..."
25622,c.j.,We'll be using this as the Green room. He can walk right out the door and up on stage.
25623,josh,What's this room usually used for?
25624,c.j.,"I don't know: desks, a black board, could be some kind of a classroom?"
25627,c.j.,What do you mean?  Nothing.
25630,c.j.,What's going on with RU-486?
25631,josh,Leo won't let me wave off the FDA.
25632,c.j.,That's against the law.
25633,josh," Yeah, I'm not talking about sticking out the fruit stand -  a phone call, a favor from a friend. I know the Chief of Staff at the subcommittee,  I got him his job."
25635,josh,This is the second time this weekend I've done that.
25636,c.j., We're taking care of it.
25637,toby,"No, I'm taking care of it."
25638,toby,I want to say for maybe the eighteenth time that I don't an announcement event at all.
25639,toby,He did that two weeks ago.
25640,josh,"If we put him up there like any other candidate, we trade away the one big advantage  we've got."
25641,toby,He's the President already?
25642,toby,He's not going to apologize.
25645,toby,I'm from the United States of suck my...
25646,josh,All right! Let's take lunch.
25651,josh,I guess that means Doug won't be coming to my sweet sixteen then.
25655,josh,"I got two years as legislative director in the House, two years as floor director in  the Senate, and thirty months as Deputy Chief of Staff. What do you got?"
25656,josh,Kalmbach's a fat-ass Rotarian gasbag. I knew once I sent the thing he'd raise the  profile and give us the press we needed.
25657,josh,"We got the money, Bruno."
25658,bartlet,I've never been nervous talking in front of big crowds. It's talking to one person...   I didn't know  you were going to be here.
25660,bartlet,I thought Leo was gonna...
25664,bartlet,"No, I think it's a good idea."
25667,bartlet,I don't know enough about agriculture.
25669,bartlet,"Yeah, well, agriculture is responsible for one in five American jobs, so it is a little  bit my field."
25671,bartlet,"15 percent of the world's cotton, 25 percent of the world's beef, and 50 percent of  the world's soybeans are grown in my field; farmers and ranchers pay taxes in my field,  their kids go to school in my field, they go to jail in my field. From time to time they  go to war in my field."
25673,bartlet,"So when I say 'it's not my field,' I'm not saying something, I'm trying to learn so I can."
25675,bartlet,Why aren't you with me?
25679,bartlet,I'm trying to read here.
25685,bartlet, Can I go a week without explaining myself?
25687,bartlet,"Sit down, we'll talk about it right now."
25689,bartlet," Isn't there any way I could change your mind, 'cause I really had my  heart set on it."
25692,bartlet,Yeah. C.J. wants her to introduce me.
25694,bartlet,I wouldn't mind a little... you know. There's gonna be a big crowd here tomorrow.
25696,bartlet,I need to finish the speech. 
25700,toby,What are you doing? (beat) Going over the transcript?
25704,toby,"He didn't lie. It's what your people call a ""sin of omission."""
25706,toby,"President Bartlet, Sam. Come on. Did you know that many Multiple Sclerosis advocates  actually instruct victims to hide the illness because it's so misunderstood?"
25712,toby,I went crazy. I whaled on him in the Oval Office.
25716,toby,Yeah. Go home. (walks away)
25733,toby,"(reading) ""My `values' are New Hampshire's `values' hard work and responsibility, strong  families and strong communities, a boundless faith in American idea of self-reliance.""  And poor people can go screw themselves."
25734,toby,"Well, if that's your point, nobody's going to understand it."
25735,toby,(sarcastically) Are there any problems you're interested in solving or are you helping  us run for the Grand Marshal of the Rose Bowl Parade?! 
25736,toby,(turns to face him) Huh? (eats something in his hand)
25737,toby,"I don't, uh, I don't know. (throws a pit hard into the garbage can)"
25745,josh,(exasperated) We're blowing this RU-486 thing. 
25747,josh,"Among everything else, it's gonna look like we're kicking off the campaign by pandering  to women's groups."
25749,josh,"Yeah, no question about it, most voters are pro-choice, but the ones that aren't are  gonna devote their lives and their money to beating you. ""Guns don't kill people;  Bartlet does."" It's gonna look like we screwed up the timing so the press is gonna  write about process and not about issues, and getting political reporters to write  about issues in the first place is like getting kids to eat their vegetables."
25751,josh,Don't you want to know how it's like getting kids to eat their vegetables?
25753,josh,(sighs and finally gets up) It helps if there's nothing else on their plate.
25755,josh,"(stops and turns to look at her) I know I could stop this thing! One phone call!  The President's not even involved! ""Could you do us a favor, could you hold off two  weeks? We love your drug but we don't want it folded into our news cycle! He's getting  more and more animated and distressed as he speaks. He's breathing heavily. I could have  picked up the phone, I could have picked up the phone, I could..."
25759,josh,"(sighs and pauses) I blew the tobacco thing... That could have helped us, and I was..."
25760,josh,This is gonna be a very close election.
25765,c.j.,I was told you wanted to see me. 
25766,bartlet,Yeah. Don't be a marriage counselor. It pisses me off. Okay?
25768,bartlet,You know what I'm talking about. 
25769,c.j.,"Sir... She walks toward him, stopping just a few feet away."
25770,bartlet,That part of my life doesn't belong to you. 
25771,c.j.,"(sincerely) Sir, I was simply putting together what I thought was the best press event.  The First Lady is an excellent speaker and..."
25772,bartlet,All right. That's all. I'll see you out there. 
25773,c.j.,"Sir, I think if you get a bump in the polls after today's speech, as we expect you will,  I think it'd be a good time for me to resign. "
25775,c.j.,"(nods) Well, to leave earlier would have been strategically..."
25777,c.j.,"(raising her voice) Look, the press is..."
25778,bartlet,"(sternly, raising his voice) That's nonsense to me and I don't care!"
25779,c.j.,"Well, you might not care..."
25780,bartlet,"(yelling, gesturing) For all the new jobs we've created, there are single mothers  working two of them at minimum wage. There are school districts where less than half  the students graduate. And a kid born in Harlem is more likely to go to prison than a  four-year college! They're bringing guns to school, C.J.!"
25781,c.j.,"(hurt, defiant) Don't you dare lecture me, Mr. President! Don't you dare do it!"
25782,bartlet,(gently) I was never supposed to win. 
25783,bartlet,I got in it polling in the single digits. Hoynes had it locked up. I got in it to give  some speeches and keep him honest...
25784,bartlet,...then you guys came along and all of a sudden I got 22% in Iowa and then South Carolina  and Michigan and... then Illinois.
25785,bartlet,(shakes his head) It was a mistake benching you for that last press conference. 
25786,bartlet,"(softly) I need you, too. "
25787,c.j.,"Thank you, Mr. President."
25788,bartlet,Did you know that hardly any of the guys who landed on the moon are married to the same  people they were married to before they went there?
25790,bartlet,I'm just saying it could be worse. I could've been an astronaut.
25792,bartlet,I'd have been a great astronaut.
25794,bartlet,I'd have overcome it to go to the moon.
25796,bartlet,(pauses to look at her) I'm really happy you're introducing me. I'm really happy about  that.Neither one of them says anything for a few moments.
25804,josh,"(after taking a sip of water) ""Torpor."""
25808,bartlet,"It's not our job to appeal to the lowest common denominator, Doug. It's our job to raise  it. If you're going to be the ""Education President,"" it'd be nice not to hide that you  have an education."
25810,bartlet,Churchill and FDR: serious men using big words for big purpose. 
25811,bartlet,"It occurs to me, I never said ""I'm sorry."" (pause) I am. (pause) For the lawyers, for the  press, for the mess, for the fear. Bruno, Doug, Connie: these guys are good. They want  to win. So do we. The only thing we want more is to be right. I wonder if you can't do  both. The staff are all standing very still, listening intently to his words. "
25812,bartlet,"There's a new book, and we're gonna write it. You can win if you run a smart, disciplined  campaign, if you studiously say nothing -- nothing that causes you trouble, nothing  that's a gaffe, nothing that shows you might think the wrong thing, nothing that shows  you think. But it just isn't worthy of us, is it, Toby? "
25814,bartlet,"It isn't worthy of us, it isn't worthy of America, it isn't worthy of a great nation.  We're gonna write a new book, right here, right now. This very moment. Today. "
25815,bartlet,You know what? Break's over.
25819,josh,Were you here all night?
25827,josh,Can I ask you something?
25829,josh,When you say in one of these boxes...
25831,josh,"Well, where is the piece of paper?  It’s... in one of these boxes."
25833,josh,You grew up in a condo.
25835,josh,"Hey, I’m not the one..."
25841,josh,"Hey, seriously, you need to sleep for a while."
25843,josh, I’ll be in the office.
25847,josh,"Donna’s like two, three days from unspooling. It’s pretty fun to watch, but can you loan  me some senior assistants from Communications?"
25853,josh,"When I was four, I wanted to be a ballerina."
25855,josh,I don’t like to... talk about it.
25857,josh,Is it all under control?
25859,josh,They’re letting it burn?
25861,josh,Putting out fires isn’t necessarily our policy?
25863,josh," Someone just said that to you, right?"
25871,josh,I’d kind of like that not to get around. 
25873,c.j.,How is it not like being served?
25874,c.j.,"Yeah, but isn’t it like the way a mugger uses a gun to produce your wallet?"
25875,c.j.,"Oliver, political reporters don’t care about the scope of the inquiry; they hear  ‘subpoenas’..."
25876,c.j.,My trouble with your spin is that we’re not going to get anywhere putting on a calm face.  We need to pick a fight!
25877,c.j.,"Because in politics, if you’re not on offense, you’re on defense."
25878,c.j.,Let me think for just a second.  What do Republicans say about him?
25879,c.j.,What do they say about him?
25881,c.j.,We need a different enemy. 
25891,josh,That’s a bad rep. I’m sweet as pecan pie.
25893,josh,"I hate these people, Leo. And when this thing is done, I’m going to personally screw them  with their pants on!"
25900,c.j.,Oliver Babish and Ainsley Hayes were just in my office.
25906,c.j.,I don’t know if he likes us but he doesn’t hate us.
25908,c.j.,"Leo, we need to be investigated by someone who wants to kill us just to watch us die.  We need someone perceived by the American people to be irresponsible, untrustworthy,  partisan, ambitious and thirsty for the limelight. Am I crazy or is this not a job for  the U.S. House of Representatives?"
25910,c.j.,"So let’s make it sooner. Let’s make it now. Rollins is driving them slow, he won’t talk  to the press, they’re ready to jump ... I swear to god, Leo, I think we can move the show!"
25916,toby,I’m leaving for this meeting.
25917,toby,This meeting when I will compromise!
25918,toby,"Yes, I do. Why do we compromise?  Because we are ordered to, because  compromising on the estate tax prevents Republicans from going for an even bigger  tax cut which would help rest the White House from our compromising little hands...  so I go to this meeting..."
25919,toby,"The estate tax which Republicans have cleverly dubbed the Death Tax there’s nothing  that... heh, the Republicans do better than naming things... So I go to this meeting...   So I go to this meeting..."
25920,toby,"Oh, I go to this meeting, Ginger, and though I compromise, I draw a line in the sand,  I’m there to insure that only multi-millionaires and not billionaires are exempt from  the estate tax."
25921,toby," Reelect the President, Bonnie. He’s on the side of millionaires and not  billionaires!"
25923,josh,They cancelled the meeting.
25924,toby,Bonnie’s got them on the phone; what’s going on?
25925,josh,They say it’s his daughter’s wedding.
25926,toby,His daughter’s wedding is on Saturday.
25927,josh,They say he wants to leave early.
25931,josh, I think they want to take it off the table.
25933,josh,The White House is weak. What would you do?
25934,toby,You think they want to repeal the estate tax? 
25936,c.j.,"No, in fact we’ve already sent over 80 cartons of documents to Clem.  I’m sorry,  to Mr. Rollins. Eighty cartons of documents that weren’t even subpoenaed and we intend to  continue cooperating with him fully. Bobbi?"
25937,c.j.,They’re a commonly used legal tool to define the scope of the inquiry. Steve?
25938,c.j.,"Well, obviously we don’t think they’re necessary, but that’s not for us to say..."
25939,c.j.,... and we take a different view than Congressional Republicans do of this Special  Prosecutor’s performance thus far: we believe he’s running a thorough and impartial  investigation and he should be allowed to finish his work.
25940,c.j.,You’d have to ask Congress that. Mark?
25989,c.j.,I was just coming to see you.
25990,c.j.,I'm putting you on Capital Beat tonight.
25991,c.j.,"""Clem Rollins is running ..."" Listen to me. ""Clem Rollins is running a thorough, fair,  and impartial investigation, he's a man of great integrity."""
25992,c.j.,"""We're eager to cooperate with the Special Prosecutor."" Don't oversell it."
25993,c.j.,They're going to introduce racial profiling. 15-minute op in the Rose Garden. 
25994,c.j.,Senate hearings on trade agreements between the US and Brazil. Campos can discuss his  objections to the President’s position.
25995,c.j.,"I don’t... Hey, you know what? The unveiling of the HELP initiative."
25996,c.j.,Hispanic Education Longevity Program. It lowers the dropout rate for Latino high school  students. 
25999,c.j.,"Before I forget Victor Campos has been added to the guest list for the unveiling of the  Hispanic Education Longevity Program. That’s Thursday, day after tomorrow. Mark?"
26000,c.j.,I can tell you that Oliver Babish and Mr Rollins had several productive conversations  about that.
26001,c.j.,"Well, they’re old friends."
26003,toby,It wasn’t in driving distance of reasonable.
26005,toby,98% of estates pay no taxes at all. We’re talking about people who are loaded!
26006,toby,"I think if we’re going to spend millions of dollars on tax breaks, we should consider  spending it on people who don’t have millions of dollars."
26007,toby,And they don’t make good yachts anymore.  What’d they say?
26008,josh,The... meeting is not going to be rescheduled.
26010,josh,Legislative Affairs has it from three rural House Democrats that Ways and Means is  trolling for votes.
26013,toby," Screw it. We went from a million to two-five, what if we throw in another..."
26015,toby,I’m saying... Maybe we expand the compromise...
26016,josh,They’re not going to reschedule the meeting!
26017,toby,"Well, how do we know until we... "
26018,josh,The meeting is not going to be rescheduled.  What do you think?
26019,toby,"I can tell you what he thinks. He thinks we roll with it. He thinks a president can’t be  against tax cuts in an election year, he thinks since our key districts have farms that  are going to be inherited, we have to... He thinks we roll with it."
26020,josh," Toby, I just... don’t know on how many fronts we can fight a war. You want to find out?"
26023,c.j.,And there’s concern on the Hill?
26026,c.j.,How’d the call with the Governor go?
26035,c.j.,You did well last night on Capital Beat. 
26036,c.j.,Babish and Rollins wrote a paper together for the Yale Law Review.
26037,c.j.,"Yeah, the problem is I can’t just make photocopies and distribute it."
26038,c.j.,I want you to get with one of your friends in the pressroom from a conservative paper. 
26040,c.j.,"Get alone with one of those guys, go off record, and say you can’t believe how the  President can be claiming to waive Executive Privileges yet still reserve the right to  withhold certain documents. Can you do that?"
26041,c.j.,"Yeah, do it quietly and kind of shake your head in disbelief."
26042,c.j.," You don’t have to keep shaking your head, just a little in the beginning."
26043,c.j.,"Yeah, but think about..."
26047,bartlet,"That’s a good pen, I need an everyday pen."
26048,bartlet,"You’ve got crappy pens, with a plastic top. I need a solid pen that feels good in my  hand, but it’s not so formal I feel like a dandy."
26049,bartlet,"I used to have the perfect pens. Every day right here, in my pocket. I loved those pens!  Balance, great action, paper soaked up the ink what the hell happened to those pens? Do  they not make them anymore? I kept that company in business."
26050,bartlet,"You know, I just haven’t gotten to it."
26052,bartlet,Is there a rush on this? 
26053,bartlet,"I have five secretaries, to say nothing of the Secretaries of State, Defense, Treasury,  and Education."
26055,bartlet,"Things have been fine. I’m gonna have dinner and I’ll be back in the office after, okay?"
26078,c.j.,"Well, Executive Privilege protects all communications that are necessary to enable a  President to do his job, but as I said the President’s waiving Executive Privilege. Mark?"
26079,c.j.,"Actually, he's trying to protect the office of the presidency. Information pertaining to  national security, for instance."
26081,c.j.,"I think if you want to know what Clement Rollins thinks, you should read some of his  writings on the subject. He was a University of Chicago Law School professor and I'm not  sure, you can check me on this but I think he was editor of the Yale Law Review. "
26082,c.j.,"That's a full lid, everybody, have a good night. "
26085,c.j.,All right. Circulate a memo to anyone who's going to see a microphone. 
26086,c.j.,"The National Fire Plan is based on Recommendations from five Federal agencies. It clearly  states that 80 years of fire suppression hasn't worked; for centuries, wildfires have  been a natural part of the evolution of the forest ecosystems."
26087,c.j.,That's the kind of thing they shouldn't say. Put that in the memo with a circle and a  line through it.
26090,c.j.,About an hour. They'll make their deadlines.
26093,c.j.,Is that what you were wondering?
26095,josh,We spent the last few hours with the Minority whip and some deputies. 
26097,josh,They have 218 without breaking a sweat.
26100,josh,"The Republicans are calling an 'all-hands,' we're assuming they'll get the full 226 plus  Fayette, Genesee and Trent. California..."
26101,toby,A state I begged you to let secede from the Union.
26102,josh,"The... entire California delegation wants a compromise. If they don't get one, they vote  to repeal."
26103,toby,We lose about another 13 votes from rural districts. Maybe 3 of them will switch back to  us if it was close but they'd get killed next November and I wouldn’t ask them to do it.
26106,toby,It's from inside the Black Caucus. That's where the 7 votes are.
26110,josh,These are members of the Congressional Black Caucus... can you think of any reason why  they'd oppose the estate tax?
26117,bartlet,I'm expecting a call from Bill Horton and I left the National Fire Plan in the dining  room.
26120,bartlet,The governor of Wyoming was an inch an a half away from calling me a pyromaniac tonight.
26122,bartlet,"I'm saying somewhere out there is a registered voter who's thinking, 'You know, I thought  I really liked this Bartlet fellow, but now that I see he's in favor of fire...'"
26124,bartlet,It's the end of the season and the fire isn't anywhere near tourists. Letting this fire  burn is good for the environment. You know how I know?
26126,bartlet,"Because smart people told me. Please god, Leo, let them be right."
26182,josh,"Surely, Congressman, the African-American community can think of better ways to spend  twenty-eight billion dollars than a tax break that’ll benefit fewer than a thousand  African-American families. "
26184,josh,That was pretty surprising. 
26185,josh,You think a few black millionaires justifies a multi-billion-dollar boondoggle?
26186,toby,"We're bleeding here, Mark."
26187,toby,"We're bleeding here, for God's sake. You can work with us or you can be ignored by a  Republican President, but those are your choices."
26188,toby,Buckland's coming after us. He’s been meeting with Victor Campos. 
26189,toby,"Who are you talking to, Mark? We're not gonna forget about failing schools in central  cities.  We're not gonna forget  about after-school care, health care for uninsured kids. We're not gonna forget about  drug treatment, or urban redevelopment, or community policing!"
26190,toby,You gotta not forget that we're bleeding!
26191,josh,The veto's an awfully big risk to take... if you can't promise anything.
26194,bartlet,So it's starting to close in on the boundary?
26198,bartlet," Yeah, but we're gonna make sure he looks  like an idiot, too, right?"
26200,bartlet, Wyoming is just going to have to have some faith that the Department  of the Interior knows what it’s doing.
26201,bartlet,"Thank you, Mr. Secretary."
26205,josh,"Yeah, I... I didn't... know... what it was at the time. I-I-I liked the word..."
26206,bartlet,We'll go with that for now.
26207,toby,"Mr. President, we’re here to recommend that you threaten to veto any repeal of the  estate tax."
26211,josh,No guarantees. He wants to see what we’re gonna do next.
26214,bartlet,I thought you don't oppose a tax cut in an election year?
26216,josh, You sign it. You don't do it with a stamp.
26217,bartlet,"Actually, you stamp it, then sign it."
26218,toby,"Who gives a damn, sir? This is a tax cut that benefits only 4500 families."
26219,bartlet,"It doesn't matter if most voters don't benefit. They all believe that someday they will.  That's the problem with the American dream. It makes everyone concerned for the day  they're gonna be rich... The governors of Wyoming, Idaho, Montana, and Utah, along with  the Senate Majority Leader and Speaker of the House, are calling me a ""fringe""  environmentalist, 'cause I'm listening to the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary  of Agriculture, along with the U.S. Forest Service, the Chief Ranger, and the Parks  Superintendent."
26220,bartlet,"They say letting the fire burn is good for the environment. And I'm betting on a weather  report, of all things. It's just one of those times."
26221,c.j.,"You don’t have a bottle opener, do you?"
26222,c.j.,I know some men carry those... 
26225,c.j.,You think I care less about irony?
26226,c.j., Anybody have a bottle opener?
26232,josh,"You’d think so, but Thomas's committee wanted it, so the Majority Leader..."
26234,josh,House Government Reform and Oversight.
26238,josh,'Cause it's not the same.
26240,josh,"At the end of the night, you want to be able to pull it open, like Tony Bennett."
26242,josh,He's also shorter than I am.
26244,josh, I was gonna do it before the entree.
26248,josh,Is there etiquette for this?
26250,josh,Then why are you bothering me?
26262,toby,You're a lively conversationalist. You won't have any problem getting...
26264,toby,Who are you sitting next to?
26265,c.j.,"Dr. Kary B. Mullis, recipient of the 1993 Nobel Prize for chemistry. Born 1944, North Carolina.  He earned his Bachelor's Degree from Georgia Tech and his PhD. in biochemistry from my alma mater,  U.C. Berkeley."
26266,toby,"If all he wants to talk about is where he's from, where he went to school, and what his name is,  you'll be fine."
26269,c.j.,(to Toby) I'll meet you there.
26275,toby,We knew that might happen.
26281,toby,The President said he was gonna veto the bill. C.J. announced he was gonna veto the bill.  He's gonna veto the bill.
26282,bartlet,There was a reason they had to cancel.
26284,bartlet,What do you think they're gonna be talking about?
26286,bartlet,They could have left after the entree.
26288,bartlet,They're gonna miss hot pumpkin soup with a cheese gnocchi and a chevre brioche.
26290,bartlet,That's a pretty big price to pay just to override my veto.
26296,bartlet,So I'd think twice about vetoing.
26299,josh,"Good evening, Mr. President."
26302,bartlet,You know what we're starting with tonight?
26304,bartlet,Hot pumpkin soup with a cheese gnocchi and a chevre brioche.
26305,josh,Was anything you just said food?
26306,toby,"Good evening, Mr. President."
26315,bartlet,I say they could've waited until after the entree.
26316,josh,Maybe they didn't know about the chevre brioche.
26322,toby,"'Cause if it's a show of strength and resolve, you don't wait to think about it."
26324,toby,They don't have the votes to override.
26326,toby,"Says me, Josh, the office of the Political Liaison, Legislative Liaison, and the Minority Whip."
26327,bartlet,Sometimes it's like I don't even need to be here.
26328,c.j.,"Good evening, Mr. President."
26329,bartlet,"C.J., you look very nice."
26330,c.j.,"Thank you, sir. Is it here?"
26332,c.j.,I've been seated next to a chemist tonight.
26334,c.j.,"Twenty-three Nobel Prize winners in the East Room, I couldn't get literature, or I don't know,  peace or something?"
26336,toby,"She thinks she won't be able to make conversation with the guy, but she's wrong 'cause she knows  what year he was born and his name."
26337,c.j.,"You got to be a cryptographer. They speak in combinations of letters that don't spell anything,  but end up meaning table salt."
26344,toby,You think they're holding an override vote tonight?
26346,toby,Why would they hold a vote if they didn't think they could override?
26347,bartlet,"They wouldn't. What do you got in the box, Mr. Dolan?"
26349,toby,"Leo, you think we lost some votes we don't know about?"
26351,josh,"Sir, if the House successfully overrides the veto, we're gonna look weak."
26352,bartlet,"If the House successfully overrides the veto, we are weak."
26355,bartlet,Table salt.  Send it back.
26356,c.j.,"The clerk of the House presented the executive clerk with HR10, a bill repealing the estate tax,  which our opponents sometimes call the Death Tax, or the We're Coming to Get Your Children tax.   Katie?"
26359,c.j.,You'd have to ask them.
26362,c.j.,"Diane Cook. Anything else? Okay, I'll be in for periodic briefings and we'll try not to keep you  too late.  What's Sherri Wexler doing here?"
26363,c.j.,She's an entertainment reporter.
26364,c.j.,"Yeah, but now she's going to cover a veto override in the House and I'm saying this is a girl who  barely covers an Easter Egg hunt."
26365,c.j.,"Ah, I've got to get back to dinner. Do you happen to have a copy of the Periodic Table of Elements?"
26374,toby,A low-in-the-polls president tells the chicken-ass Democrats to vote against a tax cut in an election  cycle. What could possibly have gone wrong? Ginger!
26375,toby,We're going to need ten phone lines in the Roosevelt room and some bodies from Legislative affairs!
26377,toby,The old whip count doesn't do us any good. We need a new one.
26379,toby,They're all sitting there. Tell them to raise their hands.
26384,toby," Ginger, the phones, the bodies, and keep an open line to the Whip's office!"
26385,toby,And get Leo out of the dinner!
26411,toby,It's Kimball on the phone right now.
26414,josh,My tie's falling apart.
26416,josh,It's not going to be...
26426,josh,I gotta get back to dinner. Can it wait a little bit?
26431,toby,He doesn't want to compromise.
26433,toby,Compromising with a 10 million-dollar exemption - here's a conversation my father never had.
26441,bartlet, Have the parents been notified? 
26442,bartlet,Has anyone claimed responsibility? 
26444,bartlet,"Nancy, hasn't State issued travel warnings since Bekaa? "
26445,bartlet,The Americans were targeted? 
26450,bartlet,You think there's an Afghan connection? 
26453,bartlet,I'm going to want some temperature-cooling options. 
26454,c.j.,"""Na"" is sodium. Sodium comes from the english word ""soda"" so wouldn't it make sense for the periodic  symbol to be somehow related to that? No, because ""na"" comes from the latin word ""natrium."" "
26457,c.j.,I'm pretty well briefed. 
26461,c.j.,What were they doing there? 
26463,c.j.,Can we say whether or not we think they were intentional targets? 
26465,c.j.,The Levys just lost their sons. I'll take the heat for a few hours. The President'll call them? 
26467,c.j.,Can I tell them the President's been in touch with the Prime Minister? 
26471,c.j.,I'm going to get in there. 
26474,c.j.,"Listen, I wanted to... "
26476,c.j.,"We'll talk hypothetically. Say a guy your age was offered a ""get out of jail free"" card. "
26477,c.j.,But everybody's getting called and everybody's getting lawyers and if you took immunity- 
26478,c.j.,"For a few hours, not 100 hours. "
26479,c.j.,I know what you're thinking. 
26480,c.j.,Okay. I'm going to change my clothes. 
26481,josh,What the hell's going on? 
26496,josh,Sorry to interrupt dinner. 
26497,josh,"I do. Good to see you guys. Anybody need a drink, or anything?"
26498,josh,"Thanks, Donna. So, Governor, the president's a tree-hugger? "
26499,josh,"""If you want to save a spotted owl Vote for Bartlet, If you want to save a job, Vote for someone else""? "
26500,josh,"No, she did, in the Indianapolis Post-Dispatch. You weren't misquoted, right? "
26501,josh,"Okay, listen. I wouldn't know a spotted owl if he walked up and introduced himself but I do know  the president's a pro-business pragmatist who has created 3.8 million new jobs."
26502,josh,The decline in manufacturing isn't because of the environment. 
26504,josh,"You want to see a study that says if we hadn't passed the Clean Air Act two million more people  would have suffered from heart disease, bronchitis, respiratory- "
26505,josh,The EPA stats on child asthma alone- 
26506,josh,"It doesn't destroy jobs, Jack, it creates them. There's a $400 billion worldwide market in  creating technologies that are environmentally safe. "
26507,josh,You invited Victor Campos to Indiana. 
26508,josh,Pam's quote in the Post-Dispatch...
26509,josh,"Jack, are you going to challenge the president in the primary? "
26511,toby,And I'm not about to be. 
26512,toby,We can win this without you. 
26513,toby,"How does a Democrat from Tennessee Farm Country, where we championed electrification -- the  Tennessee Valley Authority, farm safety nets, the... how do you do this to a democratic president? "
26516,toby,You were with us yesterday and now you're holding us hostage. 
26518,toby,Grazing fees. Let's go; we're running out of time.
26519,c.j.,I can't confirm the names of any Americans killed. Arthur? 
26520,c.j.,"The parties themselves negotiated the terms of the cease fire, and the government of the United  States remains committed to the peace process. "
26521,c.j.,"I like to call on people, Sherri."
26522,c.j.,"Well, as I said earlier we can't confirm or deny the identities of any American victims of the  bombing. "
26523,c.j.,I think the citizens of Dallas will understand that the 1974 Privacy Act precludes me from  discussing those details until the family gives its consent. Mark? 
26524,c.j.,"We're still investigating the circumstances. In the meantime, we continue to urge all parties to  demonstrate restraint. Phil."
26526,bartlet,Agency and FBI concur? 
26528,bartlet,And we shouldn't be looking outside the box? 
26530,bartlet,Retaliation for Bekaa? 
26532,bartlet,If that's the case I want to hear it from Arafat's mouth. I want to hear it from him. A denunciation  of violence. I want to see security cooperation with the Israelis. 
26541,toby,I don't want to look at the range land anymore. A one-year moratorium. 
26552,josh,Tell him to call the minority leader's office. Tell him we need to stage an exhibition. 
26554,josh,There's a rule against exhibitions on the house floor. He'll have one of our members bring a  poster on the floor another one of our members will object and the chair has to rule followed  by a vote of the full house and that'll buy 20 minutes. 
26556,josh," So... you're polling at slightly less than five percent in Iowa. After hearing  your issue profile that number actually goes down. 39% of caucus-goers say they wouldn't even  consider voting for you. ""Shares our values""? 18%. Did you know that? "
26557,josh,"In New Hampshire, you got three percent. ""Shares our values,"" 14%. After hearing your profile,  41% think you're a republican. Did you know that? "
26558,josh,"South Dakota, three percent; Georgia, eight percent; New York, seven percent. Did you know any  of that? "
26559,josh,"The reason why you didn't know, Jack, is that you don't even have the money to do out-of-state  polling right now. "
26560,josh,I did. Now with those kinds of numbers and no kind of money how can you expect to run a campaign? 
26561,josh,"He wasn't challenging a sitting president and NOBODY challenges a sitting president in a primary  by going to his right. This isn't a serious challenge you're contemplating so tell me what it is,  Jack. "
26562,josh,"Your health! We don't like your health. You're a Heisman trophy-winning football player, a U.S.  Olympian, you still run the New York Marathon and every time we see b-roll of you tossing a ball  around at the local boys' club it makes people think the president's got to campaign in an oxygen  tent. "
26563,josh,Yeah. That's what I want.
26573,c.j.,The station can't send over someone who knows what they're doing? 
26575,c.j.,Walk softly... and do something else. 
26576,c.j.,Yeah. Walk softly. Walk around.
26577,c.j.,Well... turns out she did know what she was doing. 
26580,toby,Be back in a second.  Charlie? 
26581,toby,You don't know what I was going to say. 
26583,toby,I could have been talking about a flu vaccine. 
26587,toby,"We've given him a one-year moratorium on grazing fees, support for anincrease in the production  flexibility contracts a promise not to lower agricultural export subsidies. We're up to a tougher  FDA crackdown on the illegal use of antibiotics in milk. "
26591,josh,"He wants a seat at the table, that's for sure. "
26592,toby,How far do we go with these guys? 
26593,josh,Can I offer Buckland-? 
26595,josh,"Well, he's going to keep mouthing off- "
26597,josh,Everyone will know the leak came from us. 
26616,toby,"I mean no to the FDA crackdown, no to lower agricultural subsidies, no to the production flexibility  contracts, no to the GAO review, and the president will seek to raise the grazing fees at any time  he sees fit. We're going to need the room. Would you mind, Congressman. "
26619,toby," Ginger! We need congressman Robert Royce, Republican of  Pennsylvania, on the phone. "
26626,bartlet,"Yeah, you're pretty gross. "
26628,bartlet,It's good... but... a suicide bomber got two American kids in Jerusalem. 
26632,bartlet,We're pretty sure. We got some things going. 
26634,bartlet,19 and 21. They were brothers. You speak to Zoey today? 
26636,bartlet,I thought the deal was she calls once a day. 
26638,bartlet,I want her to call every day. 
26640,bartlet,All right. You need anything? 
26646,bartlet,So you think I get on the phone with the Chairman and...
26648,bartlet,It's gonna take more than that.
26652,bartlet,We'll withhold the $100 million in NGO aid if they don't hand him over?
26654,bartlet,And you think handing him over puts the pin back in the grenade?
26658,bartlet, All right. Set up the call.
26667,josh,"All right. Tell him to have a Democrat call for a journal vote. If a member calls for a journal  vote, the full House has to approve the previous day's floor activity."""
26669,josh,"After that, he can have a member try to attach an amendment to the override vote."
26671,josh,"Doesn't matter. ""To qualify for the estate tax repeal, the estates have to have Astroturf™."""
26674,josh,"No, I meant...I'm sorry.  You came through for us in Indiana. Really, the whole Midwest.  You would've been great in the number two spot. And it was me as much as anyone pushing Hoynes."
26676,josh," Listen, I have instructions to...you know..."
26678,josh,If I could convince Leo to put you on the short list...think you could say what you want to say?
26679,josh,"I know. But I can tell you that Carl Reed wants to accept a position at Shearson, and he'll be  leaving in about three months."
26680,josh,"Well, we're afraid of everything.  But no kidding, Jack,  I-I, I think you'd make an interesting nominee for Labor Secretary."
26681,josh,So if I could convince Leo...
26687,toby,And the six that come with you.
26690,toby,"Congressman, you've been uneasy about the estate tax from the beginning."
26693,toby,If we do our best to see that you're not seriously challenged...
26707,josh,"I got away with this thing, but you should really learn how to tie a bow tie. He tosses the tie  on her desk."
26709,josh,"Yeah, but that doesn't seem that likely, right? You can go home."
26711,josh, You wanted to talk to me about something before.
26716,josh, You can't see him anymore.
26718,josh,You can't see him anymore.
26720,josh,It was just that night?
26724,josh,You just thought he was with Ways and Means who I was battling on the estate tax.
26726,josh,Did any reporters see you?
26730,josh,All right. You can go home.
26734,c.j.,"As I said, the President urged the parties to abide by the terms of the cease-fire and he reiterated  the United States's commitment to the peace process."
26736,c.j.,"Well, I'm not gonna get into the details of the diplomatic exchange. There'll be more on that  tomorrow. I'm told at this moment the House is getting ready to vote on the override of the  President's veto, and I know you'll all want to cover that. Since this is the President's first  veto, I thought it might be helpful if we brushed up on the rules. Sherri, can you tell us how  many votes it takes to override a veto?"
26737,c.j.,"How many votes does it take to override, Sherri?"
26738,c.j.,"Actually, it takes two thirds."
26739,c.j.,"Yeah, 290. And how many votes does it take to sustain?"
26740,c.j.,"That should be easy. You just subtract 290 from the total number of members in the House, and add one."
26741,c.j.,"How many people sit in the House of Representatives, Sherri?"
26742,c.j.,"Okay, maybe you can get the notes from a classmate. That's all, guys. I'll see you in the morning."
26746,c.j.,What? Are you crazy? That thing's going out to 154 affiliates!
26747,c.j.,"I changed my clothes because I didn't think it was appropriate to talk about the death of two  teenagers while wearing a ball gown, and you knew that. Because you're stupid, but you're not  stupid, you know what I'm saying? Security's gonna take your press credentials. You'll call my  office every day and I'll decide if you get into the room. I'm taking your spot on Pebble Beach -  you can do your stand-ups from Lafayette Park."
26748,c.j.,One more word out of your mouth and every local station in town but yours gets an exclusive with  the President. Hunting season on me is over.
26749,c.j., And the chemical abbreviation for table salt is NaCl.
26751,josh,They were lost in vain.
26754,toby,"Is there anything to: ""They went there in the spirit of peace""?"
26755,c.j.,"The spirit of peace, at a soccer match? Hope of Israeli and Palestinian children playing together and..."
26756,josh,"Studying together, discovering each other's worlds..."
26757,bartlet,"This guy at the dinner, he told me something I didn't know. On Yom Kippur, you ask forgiveness for  sins against God. But on the day before, you ask forgiveness for sins against people.   Did you know that?"
26758,toby,"Yeah. It's called, uh...I can't remember..."
26761,bartlet, You can't ask forgiveness of God until you've asked forgiveness of people on the day before. 
26763,bartlet,"Yeah, I'm gonna do this alone. Have a good night, everybody."
26764,bartlet," Mr. and Mrs. Levy, this is Jed Bartlet. I have three children. I really don't know what to say."
26767,c.j.,"It was a .38 pistol. Okay, here are a few confirmations and a few more details. The  shooting took place approximately 15 minutes into the 9:00 service at United Baptist  Church in Abilene, Texas.  Will Sawyer, is that you?"
26768,c.j.,You back in the country?
26770,c.j.,You working for the San Francisco Chronicle now?
26772,c.j.,Then you want to get your ass out of their chair?
26774,c.j.,You see the little brass plaques with the names of media outlets on the front of the  seats?
26777,c.j.,"Fifteen minutes into the service, Daryl Bechtell, B-E-C-H-T-E-L-L, walked into the  sanctuary. Reports indicate he was looking for his estranged wife. He fired off a  round -- that was from the .38 -- missing his wife and hitting Harold Winter in the  left shoulder. Mr. Winter is 65 and currently undergoing surgery at Abilene Regional  Medical Center. "
26778,c.j.,She's be nine years old tomorrow.
26779,c.j.,No. The Abilene Sherrif's Office will address that. I can tell you that Mr. Bechtell's  gun was registered and that Ron Cahrl had a license to carry a concealed weapon.
26780,c.j.,"Again, I'll have the Sheriff's Office speak to that, but I'll tell you that it only  prohibits it if the church or synagogue posts such a prohibition in plain sight."
26781,c.j.,Hang on.  Well... Melissa Markey died.
26817,bartlet,"Oh, like I'm not already going to hell."
26821,bartlet,"Yeah. She's skipping over the part that says, ""Wives, be subject to your husbands as to  the Lord, for a husband is the head of a wife as Christ is the head of the church."""
26827,bartlet," ""In splendor."" And I have no problem with Ephesians.  And any time you want me to cleanse you with the washing of water, you know I'm up for it."
26830,bartlet,This guy was a hack! He had a captive audience! And the way I know that is that I tried  to tunnel out of there several times. He had an audience and he didn't know what to do  with it.
26832,bartlet,Couldn't have hurt. Words...
26834,bartlet,"Words, when spoken out loud for the sake of performance, are music. They have rhythm,  and pitch, and timbre, and volume. These are the properties of music, and music has the  ability to find us and move us, and lift us up in ways that literal meanings can't. Do  you see?"
26836,bartlet,"Yes, I am. And God loves me for it."
26838,bartlet,"For other stuff, not for this. You can't just trod out Ephesians, which he blew, by the  way, it has nothing with husbands and wives, it's all of us. Saint Paul begins the  passage: ""Be subject to one another out of reverence to Christ.""  ""Be  subject to one another."" In this day and age of 24-hour cable crap, devoted to feeding  the voyeuristic gluttony of the American public, hooked on a bad soap opera that's  passing itself off as important, don't you think you might be able to find some relevance  in verse 21? How do end the cycle? Be subject to one another!"
26840,bartlet,"No, it's not about me! Well, yes, it is about me, but tomorrow it'll be about somebody  else. We'll watch Larry King and see who.  All hacks, off the stage! Right now!  That's a national security order."
26842,bartlet,How does Mrs. Sinatra feel about that?
26844,bartlet, You make me egg foo yung...
26845,c.j.,"Good morning, Mr. President."
26846,bartlet, You make me feel there are songs to be sung...
26848,c.j.," No, I won't. I'm sorry, Mr. President, Melissa Markey died."
26850,bartlet,"Ah, damn. Charlie, can I see Leo?"
26854,bartlet,Okay.  When do you think I should go in there?
26855,c.j.,I'd wait a couple of hours till we hear some more facts.
26856,bartlet,You'll talk to the sheriff's office and...
26859,c.j.,"Yeah, but you don't want to walk too far into that."
26864,bartlet,C.J. thinks I should wait a few hours.
26867,c.j.,"Thank you, Mr. President. "
26868,bartlet,"Be subject to one another, Leo. What can I do to be of subject to you?"
26874,bartlet,He's not going to want to do it.
26876,bartlet,What are you doing today?
26880,bartlet,"Keep me out of it, all right?"
26882,bartlet,You think I should send Hoynes to Texas?
26884,bartlet,"All right, get him over here."
26904,c.j.,You're sitting in my chair.
26908,c.j.,"Well, you've been gone three weeks."
26912,c.j.,So what happened? I thought you were our man in Myanmar.
26914,c.j.,"Well, is there a third world country you haven't been kicked out of?"
26916,c.j.,Why'd they kick you out?
26924,c.j.,Put a bounty on your head.
26928,c.j.,Oh. That had to be embarrassing in front of your narco-baron friends.
26932,c.j.,Why did you want to see me?
26936,c.j.,"""If the President wins reelection, it will be on the Vice President's coattails""?"
26942,c.j.,"Will, do me a favor. Give me a little time to check it out, would you?"
26944,c.j.,You've been gone two and a half years?
26946,c.j.,Seemed like less than that.
26970,bartlet,Do you know this church?
26971,bartlet,The United Baptists Church in Abilene?
26972,bartlet,"Listen, you feel like having a beer with me?"
26973,bartlet,"On Sundays, when we got back from church, my father would let my brother and me split a  beer. It got to be a habit."
26974,bartlet,"Nancy?  Nancy, could I get  a cold beer and some ice water?"
26975,bartlet,And close the door please.  Nancy does what she was told.
26976,bartlet,"It's what Texans do.  The NRA systematically worked the legislatures to weaken conceal-and-carry  laws, the effect of which is to increase gun sales and pad its own membership."
26977,bartlet,The National Conference on State Legislatures is meeting this weekend at the Convention  Center in San Antonio.
26979,bartlet, It's also what Vice Presidents do.Nancy comes in and serves them beer and water.
26994,c.j.,I called you at home. I had you paged.
26996,c.j.,I didn't know you were here.
26999,toby,"Clearly, I'm here, but I-I-I'm not open for business. I heard the President was meeting  with Hoynes, so I-I-I wanted to see how-how it goes."
27001,toby,And I see you picked Chicago over Cincinnati so let me explain to you why your money's  gonna be in my pocket.
27002,c.j.,"If the President wins reelection, it's gonna be on the Vice President's coattails?"
27003,toby, You want to know what's weird? I-I-I just said... that exact same thing a couple  of days ago.
27004,c.j.,I know. You know how I know? Will Sawyer just told me.
27005,toby,Will Sawyer's in Myanmar.
27006,c.j.,He got kicked out of Myanmar. He's in the room now.
27007,toby,"C.J., I said it... I said it at that W.A. meeting. I said it a the end of the meeting.  We were talking about areas where Hoynes is polling stronger than... It was...   Do I have a little time?"
27013,toby," I want you to page every junior staffer and senior assistant who works in the  West Wing, every single one. I want them to assemble downstairs in the mess in two hours."
27014,toby,"If they can't be here in two hours, then they don't need to come in tomorrow morning."
27032,josh,He wants to abolish the penny?
27038,josh,You've been reading about this?
27042,josh,It's almost hard to believe that plan hasn't worked.
27050,josh,I'm not. I wasn't before. When did she tell you that?
27054,josh,She should be done by now.
27058,josh,Why can you use it in Illinois?
27063,c.j.,I'm gonna have something for you soon. Toby's talking to some people.
27067,c.j.,"Somebody said you were hanging out with some tribe, and they made you a king."
27075,c.j.,I gotta go there and bring my laptop. It quacks when I have e-mail.
27079,c.j.,"Yeah. No, good safety tip."
27083,c.j.,He's meeting with Leo McGarry.
27085,c.j.,"I don't know. Listen, you made a joke before."
27087,c.j.,About being assigned to the White House until you could get a real reporting job.
27091,c.j.,Okay. I'll have something for you on the other thing soon.
27094,bartlet,"And if you look at the state of New Jersey, which has a ""may issue"" law-if you look at  changing that one word..."
27095,bartlet,"Changing that one word means law enforcement can decide who gets a concealed weapon and  when and where they can carry it. Texas has a ""may issue"" law in front of a legislature  right now, and you going down there..."
27096,bartlet,It's counter-scheduling. You go in front of an unfriendly audience. You tell them  something they don't want to hear-it shows you have courage.
27097,bartlet,You're a hero in Texas.
27098,bartlet,Texans don't like that you have the courage of your convictions?
27100,bartlet,That's not good enough.
27101,bartlet,"A tradition that's passed on from father to son? We tamed the frontier, John. We did that  already."
27102,bartlet,Let them stand in this room and say that. On this day. Let them stand in this room.  I like it?! She was nine years old! 
27103,bartlet,Green Bay lost.  She was nine years old.
27104,bartlet,Well... that is an excellent point. I never saw it that way.
27107,bartlet,"You know what? Last year, gun deaths? 30,708. Alcohol deaths? 35,450. Tobacco deaths?  400,000. Marijuana deaths? Zero. This guy, the second shooter-Rambo? He's gonna get  nothing. He's gonna get a parade. You know why? There was no sign posted in the church  saying you can't carry a concealed weapon.  I'm just playing devil's advocate.  She was nine years old."
27140,josh,Why did you say you didn't?
27142,josh,What do you mean you don't know?
27144,josh,Is there anyone else in the witness list who knows you keep a diary?
27149,josh,"You don't get to decide that! You don't get to decide what's material and what isn't,  Donna!"
27151,josh,"This is how it happens. They got nothing on the President with MS. They're trolling,  then you go in and hand them a..."
27153,josh,You were subpoenaed! You were under oath! You answer the damn question!
27156,josh,Do nothing. Do absolutely nothing.
27157,toby,"There's an old saying: ""Those who speak, don't know; and those who know, don't speak.""  I don't know if that's true or not, but I know that by and large the press doesn't care  who really knows what as long as they've got a quote. Last Friday, we had our Week Ahead  meeting in the Roosevelt Room. Some of you were there, most of you weren't, but I'm  talking to all of you now. Bruno Gianelli and I were leading a discussion about whether  or not the President should stop in Kansas on his way back from the West Coast, and I  remarked that the Vice President is polling better than the President right now in the  Plains states... "
27159,toby," Yeah... You're a good deputy, Sam."
27163,toby,"Yeah, but I mean it anyway. What can I do for you today? How can I help you out?"
27165,toby,This is the Legal Tender... Huckleberry Bill?
27167,toby,We can't support it 'cause it'll never get to the floor.
27169,toby,Where's the Speaker of the House from?
27175,toby,Sure. They start walking up the stairs again.
27184,c.j.,"Yes, I did... Well, Toby made the remark in response to some new polling data. It was  offhand. Obviously, he meant it as a joke. He regrets it."
27186,c.j.,He'll be happy to go on the record with you.
27190,c.j.,You're not gonna let Toby explain himself?
27198,c.j.,"You weren't joking before, were you?"
27202,c.j., Why do you think the White House is a bad beat?
27205,c.j.,You can sit anywhere you want. 
27223,bartlet,"Can I ask you a question, just out of curiosity?"
27224,bartlet,"If guns are meant to deter the threat of crime, what's the point of concealing them?  I mean, wouldn't you want the criminal to see that you've got a gun?"
27225,bartlet,Then what's the answer to that?
27227,bartlet,"We can't all just agree it's a stupid-ass amendment that was written before there were  street lamps, much less police forces, and move on?"
27228,bartlet,There's no need for a citizen militia.
27230,bartlet,Only 16% believe gun ownership is an absolute right. Only 9% believe it's an absolute  wrong. There's a middle. We can win them!
27231,bartlet,Which we wouldn't have been doing if...
27233,bartlet," You outed me, John. With that trip to Nashua, with the oil companies. You wanted  people to start asking questions."
27237,bartlet,"It's not easy being my Vice President, is it?"
27238,bartlet,"I wouldn't think so.  But it's the only way  you're gonna get the nomination. You know that, right? If I win."
27245,josh,"There's a coffee shop across the street. You can read it there. You've got an hour.  I haven't read it, but if anything bothers you, you'll issue a subpoena in the morning.  You'll have it back before the end of the day. If not, that's that."
27246,josh,"If I read any of this in the newspaper, or anything happens I don't like, I've got the  entries for October 4th and 5th."
27248,josh, It's starting to get cold already. 
27263,bartlet,The propellers aren't going.
27264,bartlet,They know I want to leave now?
27265,bartlet,The propellers aren't going.
27266,bartlet,"That makes sense. Also, there's a chance I could get hit getting on or off."
27268,bartlet,You think I'm not tall enough to get hit in the neck by the propellers on Marine One?
27269,bartlet,"I duck when I get on that helicopter, and you should, too. It's just good safety sense."
27270,bartlet,They know I want to leave now?
27271,bartlet,"Filing day, Charlie. Last to get on the ballot in New Hampshire. "
27272,bartlet,"I'm going myself. Or, I could send an aide."
27273,bartlet,"I'm going myself. Always have, always will."
27274,bartlet,"Fair enough. Always have, never will. But I'm going myself. You know why?"
27275,bartlet,It's a profound statement about democracy. Are you mocking me?
27276,bartlet,The thing before wasn't a crack about my height?
27278,bartlet,"Yes, I am. I'm going myself."
27280,bartlet,"It's not a problem. I'm up, I'm back. The whole thing takes two hours."
27282,bartlet,I do love doing this. It's one of my all time favorite...
27292,bartlet,"What does ""we don't have it"" mean?"
27296,bartlet,And they're in North Korea?
27298,bartlet," Yeah. I think I'll go ahead and cancel that trip, Leo. If only to stick  around to see how this sounds worse than it really is."
27301,c.j.,I'm glad. What is this song about?
27302,c.j.,"I know, for his shirt, he's too sexy."
27306,c.j.,"So, it's not a problem. It's not a song about somebody having a problem."
27308,c.j.,Not yet. Is there anything?
27310,c.j.,Wait a second. Are you telling me he got the question and he-
27311,c.j.,Get me the transcripts.
27312,bartlet,"Where's the damn submarine, Nancy? I don't want to hear I don't know, I want to hear how  many people are out there swimming around looking for it."
27316,bartlet,How long can the crew survive down there?
27318,bartlet,How close are these guys to landfall?
27319,bartlet, Four thousand yards? They get that close?
27322,bartlet,Can they send a distress signal?
27324,bartlet,They would wait to send a distress signal and risk their lives?
27325,bartlet,"Well, that's great. I assess the national interest by the number of people alive, not dead.  You have four hours before I order the Pacific Fleet into Haeju Bay. "
27329,bartlet,Is Peter still recovering?
27331,bartlet,All right. We'll talk to someone else. Someone we trust.
27341,bartlet, Was it... I don't... Was it major heart surgery? 
27343,bartlet,He's gonna scold me. He's been at the State Department since Truman. He thinks I'm a kid  and that he outranks me.
27345,bartlet,"I've gotta tell him I lost a submarine. Can I make something up, like ""say, a friend of  mine hypothetically..."""
27347,bartlet,Bring a copy of the constitution. I'm gonna show him I'm not scared.
27349,bartlet,"Hey, Bruno, can you devise a campaign strategy that involves beating the crap out of Leo?"
27361,toby,What does one hundred and five million dollars mean to you?
27363,toby,"I just got tipped that the new budget will include an additional one hundred and five  million dollars for the National Park Service, and that number means something, and I  can't remember what!"
27367,toby," Just give me a few minutes, I'll be back. "
27368,toby,Does one hundred and five million dollars mean anything to you?
27370,toby,Bonnie? One hundred five million?
27373,c.j.," I'm too sexy for my shirt, too sexy for my skirt,  too sexy... for the other...things."
27379,c.j.," Last night. Local news, Cleveland, Ohio. Oh-mio, oh-my-oh, Oh Cleveland Ohio!  He got the question!"
27380,toby,Why do you want to be President?
27381,c.j.,"""The reason I would run, were I to run, is I have a great belief in this country as a  country, and in this people as a people, that go into making this country a nation with  the greatest natural resources and people, educated people."""
27383,c.j.," I'm too sexy for my shoes, too sexy for the  blues, too sexy..."
27385,toby,"The new budget's going to have an additional one hundred and five million or the Park  Service, does one hundred and five million mean anything to you?"
27386,c.j.," No, except it's the same amount as the budget for the National Endowment  for the Arts."
27407,toby,"By and large, I'm not wild about musicals. "
27408,toby,You're dissolving the Endowment to give more money to national parks? 
27415,toby,Appropriations wants to eliminate the NEA. What's going on in there? 
27419,toby,"All right, I'll be in when I can. "
27426,c.j.,The Majority Leader got the question last night. 
27431,c.j.,"We've got an answer, right? "
27433,c.j.,"If he's asked why he wants to be President, we've got a good answer. "
27459,bartlet,Every single election...
27461,bartlet,"Legislature, house, governor. "
27466,bartlet,Okay. It's a profound statement about democracy. 
27469,bartlet,Can I get you anything? 
27471,bartlet,"Okay. Okay. I've asked you here, Albie, because you're the assistant Secretary of State and I,  of course, am the President. "
27477,bartlet,"Thanks, Albie. That much, the National Security Council has made clear to me. "
27480,bartlet,"And if they were in trouble, you see, they wouldn't send a distress signal 'cause they might  be detected and submariners have a different set of criteria when assessing risk versus reward. "
27482,bartlet,"Okay, I'll just stand over there. "
27487,bartlet,"Cause for war. Little thing called Latin. Albie, if we tell North Korea we've violated their  waters it could be interpreted as an act of war? "
27489,bartlet,Okay.  Can I talk to you alone for a second? 
27491,bartlet,Let's not call North Korea just yet. 
27493,bartlet,Leo. Gut feeling. Has the boat gone quiet? 
27495,bartlet,All right. Three more hours. 
27499,bartlet,"Also, he'd be good to have around for morale, 'cause he's Mr. Happy Fun Guy. "
27501,bartlet,Albie. I'm gonna ask you to stay around for a while. 
27503,bartlet,"Charlie, could you have someone bring some Schweppes' Bitter Lemon and the Constitutional  Order of Succession, please? "
27504,josh," New paragraph. As always, your thoughtfulness is greatly appreciated. Also appreciated  was the visit to the White House by some fifty of your constituents on board a bus that was  chartered by your office. Their complaints were respectfully heard by my assistant and I regret  that matters escalated to the point where she felt it necessary to call in the Park Police.  You'll be happy to know that their bus has been refueled and that the seniors are on their  way home, each having been allowed to keep their security tags as a souvenir. "
27516,josh,What's wrong with yours? 
27519,josh,We had a little problem earlier. What's up? 
27520,c.j.,The Majority Leader got the question last night. 
27521,josh,"Yeah. And he just kept on diggin'. 'We have the greatest technolgy of any people of any country  in the world along with the greatest--not the greatest, but very serious problems confronting  our people, and I want to be President in order to focus on these problems in a way that uses  the energy of our people to move us forward, basically.' "
27523,josh,It's the basically that makes it art. 
27524,c.j.,"Listen, the best thing we can do is to take a step back. We can't be seen to be gloating. "
27525,josh,"Sure, yeah. We, we do that when nobody's looking. "
27529,josh,Poured Wheatina on her keyboard.
27530,c.j.,Listen - How good is our answer? 
27544,toby,The mission of the NEA IS to subsidize artists in this country. 
27545,toby,"In fact, it's not to subsidize artists - it's to subsidize art. "
27546,toby,"Well, they're pretty bright in Topeka. None of the artists you mentioned ever received any  direct money from the Endowment. Why? Because the last time the Republicans tried to lose  the NEA - not three times ago, but the last time - we got rid of the individual grants! "
27547,toby,"Tawny, you'd need the Budweiser Clydesdales to drag my ass to Picasso and Monet! I'm not the  guy you want deciding this! And you're not the guy I want deciding this! And I don't know  where you get the idea that taxpayers shouldn't have to pay for anything of which they  disapprove. Lots of 'em don't like tanks. Even more don't like Congress. "
27550,toby,"Look, we can't spend soft money on a primary ad anyway, so... "
27552,toby,What magic words test? 
27554,toby,If it doesn't use those specific words... 
27560,toby,"I've gotta go back in there. When I come back, show me an ad without the magic words."
27575,bartlet,"Oh, God, I'm sorry, am I still here? "
27576,bartlet,"I haven't lost the boat yet, Mr. Secretary, and I happen to be the only one in the building  who thinks we should be sending the fast attack subs right now. And I'm an hour from  gathering the NSC and calling Japan. "
27579,bartlet,"There was a UN action, Mr. Secretary. Sixteen countries were involved in that police action,  Mr. Secretary. Thirty-three, thirty-four thousand American dead. How come we're the only ones  still fighting? Where did everybody go? "
27584,josh,"Good afternoon, Mr. Secretary. Anything going on I should know about? "
27586,josh,This can wait for another time. 
27587,bartlet,"No, give it to me now. I want a distraction. "
27588,josh,"No, it's all right sir. "
27590,josh,It's campaign-related. 
27592,josh,"Well, the, uh Majority Leader got the question last night. "
27594,josh,"Yeah, and we're starting to put together an answer for when you get it. "
27596,josh,Why do you want to be President? 
27598,josh,"Well, we'll put that in the hopper and show you a draft. "
27600,josh,"Thank you, Mr. President.  "
27603,josh,This is a time of dizzying change and progress around the world. I'm running for re-election  'cause I want to make sure that all our people can share in 21st century jobs-- 
27604,c.j.,Jobs and industries we can't even imagine today...bring the benefits of new medical  advancements to all our families-- 
27605,josh,And harness new technology and the internet as a force for faster economic growth-- 
27606,c.j.,Better education and a freer exchange of ideas around the world. 
27611,josh,You wanna say something? 
27614,josh,"It's got crisp, commanding phrases, it's got active verbs like 'harness,' it paints a  picture of the future-- "
27617,c.j.,Sometimes you get your face on a coin. 
27618,josh,Okay. This shouldn't be hard.
27619,toby,"You guys should charge money for this, Tawny. You should sell tickets and charge money and  call it ""Journey Back to Germany."" Where, in 1937, they held a show of degenerate art,  vilifying art they deemed sick, art that featured insolent mockery of the divine, art that  wasted the taxes of the German working people. "
27622,toby,In Europe and Japan they're spending between 1.5 and 3 billion on the arts. Congress thinks  105 million is indulgent? 
27623,toby,There is a connection between progress of a society and progress in the Arts. The age of  Pericles was also the age of Phidias. The age of Lorenzo de Medici was also the age of  Leonardo Da Vinci. The age of Elizabeth was the age of Shakespeare. 
27628,toby,"The parks are safe, Tawny. We spend a lot of money on that. "
27629,toby,And the money for that could come from someplace else. 
27631,toby,Yeah.  What do you want? 
27660,toby,So let's stick to the spirit of the law. 
27662,toby,"No, I'm saying let's do an issue ad, an actual issue ad. Let's do a bunch. Health care,  equal opportunity-- "
27663,toby,School construction. Does anyone think that raising awareness of crumbling schools won't  help us? 
27665,toby,"And when schools fall down, so do test scores. "
27671,bartlet,Yeah. We're going now. 
27672,bartlet,What happened? Did you contact Pac fleet? 
27676,bartlet,How many trips will it take? 
27678,bartlet,Let's go get 'em. Time's up. 
27685,bartlet,"All right, okay. There they are. See, they went deep and quiet to avoid a close-aboard with  a Luna class destroyer. What you gotta do in these situations is you trust the captain,  you trust the crew. "
27690,bartlet,So I'm on the ballot in New Hampshire. 
27691,bartlet,Okay.  When Romans ran for the office of Counsel - did I just see you roll your eyes? 
27692,bartlet,"They wore whitened togas to show their intent - a bit silly, perhaps... "
27693,bartlet,But it was an act of personal commission. 
27695,bartlet,You're pretty mouthy today. 
27697,c.j.,"Good afternoon, Mr. President. "
27698,bartlet,Hey. Do you duck when you're getting on Marine One? 
27702,bartlet,I think the blades are high enough. 
27703,c.j.,The Majority Leader got the question last night. 
27706,bartlet,"Yeah, listen. I want you to go easy on him. He's a conscientious and dedicated guy.  It's not an easy question. "
27708,bartlet,Why do I want to be President? 
27710,bartlet, I've been thinking about it for the last couple of hours. I almost had it.
27711,bartlet,I'm not wild about Camp David.
27713,bartlet,"I'm not the only one, either. Bess Truman didn't like it. I read that somewhere.  She thought it was dull.  But there I go, Thanksgiving at Camp David."
27715,bartlet," It's not a place you go at Thanksgiving, not when you have a farm."
27716,c.j.,Isn't Camp David a farm?
27719,bartlet,What makes you think it's a farm?
27720,c.j.,"I don't know, it's outside..."
27721,bartlet,"Farms have things you can grow, and animals."
27723,bartlet,I want you to learn more about farms.
27727,bartlet,"Doesn't matter. Thanksgiving's where your family is, and this year my family's at  Camp David. Why, I do not know. Abbey didn't wanna schlepp to New Hampshire.  Schlepping in a 747. It's not like we were gonna have to carry our own bags or  anything, but I do not argue. "
27728,bartlet,Were we talking about something?
27729,c.j.,"I don't know, sir. When I came in here, back in the late '50s, there was a purpose to it,  but then one thing led to another and I blacked out. I mean, I can hang in there with  the best of them, sir, but somewhere during the discussion of anise and coriander and  the other 15 spices you like to use to baste a turkey, I simply lost consciousness."
27730,bartlet, You know that line you're not supposed to cross with the President?
27732,bartlet,No-no. Look behind you.
27734,bartlet,Would you like to leave?
27735,c.j.,"With your permission, sir."
27736,bartlet,"Damn right, with my permission. "
27738,bartlet,"It's the brine that keeps the meat soft, lady. You soak it overnight in water, salt, sugar..."
27740,bartlet,Seventeen kinds of spices including?
27743,c.j.,"Thank you, Mr. President. "
27747,c.j.," I set up the I Board meeting with the Post on budget gains,  I did an early briefing on the week loot and import quarter proclamation, reported the  turkey, went to my dentist. I'm done."
27748,josh,So there are these two Indians in the lobby.
27750,josh,"No, it's-it's not the beginning of a joke. I'm saying there's these two Indians in the lobby."
27751,c.j.," And I'm saying ""yeah?"""
27752,josh,"They had a meeting scheduled this morning with Jacob Cutler at Intergovernmental Affairs.  Cutler had to cancel the meeting so he could see northwestern border state governors to  discuss pourous borders between the U.S. and Canada, that's the governors of Washington,  Idaho, North Dakota, Montana and Alaska."
27754,josh,"Yeah, well, apparently the Indians say they're not leaving until they get satisfaction."
27755,c.j., How is this my problem?
27756,josh,"C.J., there's two Indians sitting in the lobby, they say they're not leaving, there's  press everywhere. I just made it your problem."
27757,c.j., Indians on the day before Thanksgiving. Wow. Ironic. 
27759,c.j.,  Good morning. I'm CJ Cregg.
27760,c.j.,"I'm sorry about your meeting, Mr. Cutler had to meet with some northwestern governors  about an important problem."
27761,c.j.,It'll be no problem to reschedule the appointment.
27762,c.j.,Would you like to step into my office and we can try to reschedule it right now?
27764,c.j.," Actually, you're not fine here."
27765,c.j.,"This is gonna have something to do with us screwing you out of all your land, isn't it?"
27767,josh,I was just coming to see you. Did you hear about the two Indians in the lobby?
27769,josh,"It's not a joke, they're really... Nevermind."
27771,josh,"I read about that. They can't find the kid, right?"
27775,josh,Why isn't this conversation taking place in the DeKalb County DA's office?
27782,toby, Sam? Are you guarding my office?
27787,toby,I saw that. Doesn't it need Presidential approval before it goes to Congress?
27791,toby,What does that shake out to?
27797,toby,And taxpayers are nuts about that. Let's get back to the bad news. Four million people  became poor on the President's watch?
27799,toby,What was wrong with the old formula?
27803,toby,"Well, get together with somebody at OMB and find out what was wrong with the statistical  reality of the old formula."
27807,toby,It's like when they did that thing with the SAT scores and I got dumber twenty years  after I went to college.
27812,c.j.,"Listen, this isn't a good place for this. This is... a lobby."
27814,c.j.,What tribe are you from?
27815,c.j.,And you were forced to sell the land?
27816,c.j.,"Well, before we go any further, I should tell you, there's absolutely nothing I can do for you."
27818,josh,Did you get me a flight?
27820,josh,Excellent. One that gets me there in time for dinner?
27822,josh,And I don't have to change planes in Atlanta?
27826,josh,There must be something.
27828,josh,It would trigger a Congressional investigation?
27832,josh,And remember to scold me a couple times before I leave.
27834,josh,"No, but I thought I was going to Connecticut."
27836,josh,'Cause that's where the house is.
27840,josh,"I'm from Connecticut, okay?! And like a swallow to Capistrano, I have to... Just, find me  a flight, would you? And call Russell Angler at the State Department and tell him I need  to see him about the kid in Georgia, he'll know what I'm talking about."
27842,josh," You're the girl I made fun of in elementary school, you know that?"
27848,josh,Did you hear about this kid?
27850,josh,"His parents, who are in custody, Fed-Exed him to Rome, which is in Italy."
27852,josh,"No, it's really in Italy."
27853,josh,But that's not the best part.
27855,josh,The best part is that Italy won't extradite him.
27857,josh,They've come a long way since Mussolini.
27863,josh,The OMB's recommending a new model?
27865,josh,"Well, I'm not an expert, but wouldn't we have a better chance at getting re-elected if we  could say there were four million fewer poor people? Hang on, wait. I am an expert."
27867,josh, You gonna try and get her not to recommend the new model?
27871,josh, She's a little tough to warm up.
27875,josh,Sounds like you've got a pretty good plan.
27877,josh,Don't go through the lobby.
27881,josh,No. There are Indians in the lobby.
27883,bartlet,"Bess Truman didn't like Camp David, either, she thought it was dull. Doesn't matter."
27884,bartlet,"Long as you've got an oven, and you go to three hundred and twenty degrees. You take your  turkey, which has been soaking overnight in water, salt, coriander..."
27889,toby,"Before anything else, I was hoping I could impose on you for as much information you could  spare about making a turkey."
27890,bartlet,This is some sort of pre-emptive psychological thing?
27892,bartlet,That's not going to work.
27893,toby,"Yeah. You're gonna see, on next week's message calendar, there's a notation about a new  federal initiative to provide low-cost cell phones to neighborhood watch groups."
27894,bartlet,I saw the message calendar. I'm having some difficulty navigating the color-coding.
27895,toby,"The colors are for areas - Blue is education... Green is economy, it's a quick glance way  to let us know if we're getting enough hits on our issues."
27896,bartlet,"Well, there should be a separate color for things I don't care about."
27898,bartlet,Providing low-cost cell phone service to neighborhood watch groups.
27901,toby,"You spot a crime, you gonna go to a pay phone?"
27902,bartlet,"There's nothing wrong with the policy, it's just too small. I could fund this initiative  out of my pocket."
27903,toby,It's ten million dollars.
27904,bartlet,"Leo could fund it out of his pocket. Shouldn't this be local government, like the YMCA  or something?"
27905,toby,"We have an idea, which we have reason to believe is popular, which is, that in addition  to passing large and abstract pieces of legislation-"
27906,bartlet,"We pass minute, but easy to understand."
27912,bartlet,Bring me that polling data.
27913,toby,What kind of stuffing are we talking about?
27914,bartlet,"Cornbread, oysters, water chestnuts, andouille sausage."
27915,toby,You gonna cook on the inside or separate?
27917,toby,You better make sure it cooks.
27919,toby,"If it doesn't cook, people are gonna get sick."
27921,toby,"They'll be very, very sick."
27922,bartlet,I've got it covered. Anything else?
27923,toby,You know about the new OMB definitions?
27924,bartlet,I know they're coming out. What's it going to look like?
27925,toby,Depends. You want more poor people or fewer poor people?
27927,toby,"You got it. Thank you, Mr. President."
27928,bartlet,"...carroway seeds, thyme, cornbread, oysters, water chestnuts and Handui sausage."
27930,bartlet,"Yeah. But Toby seemed to indicate that you have to be careful if you cook it inside the  turkey, because in some cases it doesn't cook, and when that happens, people get sick."
27934,bartlet, 'Cause I thought Toby might be playing with me.
27936,bartlet,But you said you've heard of it.
27938,bartlet,"Nah, you don't have that kind of wit."
27940,bartlet,I need to talk to an expert.
27944,bartlet,"No. No, I can't. Thanks Margaret. "
27945,bartlet,I can't ask Rene right now.
27947,bartlet,"Well, frankly, I thought he did something stupid and inconsiderate last week, but it  turns out I was just in a bad mood."
27949,bartlet,"Yes. And while he didn't deserve it, he will someday soon. "
27951,bartlet,82 percent are in favor of fixing potholes?
27953,bartlet,I'm gonna look at this.
27955,bartlet,"They want the nickel and dime stuff, I'll tell you one thing we can do."
27956,bartlet,This time of the year there should be a hotline you can call with questions about cooking  turkey. A special 800 number where the phones are staffed by experts.
27958,bartlet, Butterball has a hotline?
27960,bartlet,"God, I'm sorry, I love my country. Charlie, get me the number for the Butterball hotline."
27962,bartlet,I don't think this is the right one.
27963,bartlet,"Yeah, this is something different. Hang on a second. This is--  Find Bruno Gianelli, tell him I wanna see him right away."
27976,josh,Have you ever seen anything like this before?
27981,josh,They're gonna give him a Eurail pass and a backpack?
27982,josh,"First of all, it isn't up to the governor, it's up to the DeKalb DA. Second of all...  this is Georgia."
27983,josh,"This kid shoots his teacher in the head and gets life in Venice, we're all gonna look  like idiots. I gotta put this out before it's in the papers."
27987,c.j.,"And why would you want to buy back the bad land, too?"
27988,c.j.,"So, what you need is, what?"
27989,c.j.,I'm sure that's handled by the Department of the Interior.
27991,c.j.,These things take a little bit of time.
27992,c.j.,"It's a big interior, Maggie."
27997,c.j.,I'm just talking to my friends.
27998,c.j.,"Have a good weekend, Mark. Have a good Thanksgiving."
28000,c.j.,Oh. To have it be over.
28001,josh,"I know ""The Little Red Lighthouse."" That's a great book."
28002,josh,The George Washington bridge.
28003,josh,"Yeah, you peer down just at the right moment, you can see the top of it."
28006,josh,"Well... Federal Law doesn't allow it, but people in the state of Georgia do, so there's  not much... A waiter brings by a tray of coffee and food."
28008,josh,Alberto... please. You'll have the ambassador speak to the foreign minister and send the kid back?
28010,josh,The kid wasn't throwing food.
28011,josh," See, it's... it's p[problematic when other people make my argument for me."
28012,josh,Okay. I'm gonna... I'll ask around about the book.
28013,c.j., What about the assistant secretary for Indian affairs?
28015,c.j.,Deputy Director of Intergovernmental affairs?
28016,c.j.,Deputy of Acquisition... isn't there a deputy of Acquisition and Property Management?
28018,c.j.,I'm here! They're here! You're here!
28019,c.j.,Tell Leo's office I'm coming over. 
28021,toby,Isn't this one of those things that can be argued from all sides?
28023,toby,"And one way or another, they're all right?"
28025,toby,You can put the numbers together a lot of different ways?
28027,toby,"Okay, well, let's put them together in a way that there's just fewer poor people."
28029,toby,"Or, if we have to go with the new formula, delay as long as we can - we have to test it."
28044,bartlet,What the hell is this? 
28046,bartlet, It's a poll. I asked to see a poll about certain...  doesn't matter. Then send up the wrong poll. This one asks voters where I should spend  Thanksgiving.
28047,bartlet,What the hell are you doing polling where I should spend Thanksgiving?
28048,bartlet,I have Thanksgiving with my family.
28050,bartlet,You politicize family to make sure they don't look political.
28051,bartlet,My family is off limits. 
28052,bartlet,"I'll decide when I've used them up. You don't poll where my family goes, am I making myself clear?"
28054,bartlet,"Ah, something important!"
28055,bartlet,"The number for the Butterball Hotline.  Watch, and learn."
28060,c.j.,That's a pretty long time.
28062,c.j., And you know all we're talking about is a sewage plant and a  house center. They're not asking for the Great Plains. 
28064,c.j.,What can I tell them in the meantime?
28066,c.j.,It'd be nice if they could see someone before he left. They had an appointment.
28070,c.j.,"We do it Monday, they're gonna stay here till Monday. Absent being dragged off in handcuffs,  of this I'm sure. Plus right is right."
28074,c.j.,"They walk out of here, they've met with the Chief of Staff."
28083,bartlet,You polled where I should have Thanksgiving?
28084,toby,"Yeah, I saw that question."
28085,bartlet,And it was okay with you?
28088,toby,Because it was okay with Joey Lucas.
28089,bartlet,You think people should care where I have Thanksgiving?
28090,toby,I know I don't give a damn...
28091,bartlet,All right. Doesn't matter. I straightened it out. It has a lot to do with kelp.
28095,bartlet,"Well, first let me say, I think this is a wonderful service you provide."
28097,bartlet," I'm Joe Betherson...sen. That's one 't', and with an 'h' in there."
28099,bartlet," My street address is 114... 54 Pruder Street, and it's very important  that you put 'street' down there because sometimes it gets confused with Pruder Way and  Pruder Lane. Apartment 23 R... Fargo, North Dakota... "
28101,bartlet,I do radio commercials for... products.
28102,bartlet," Stuffing should be stuffed inside the turkey, am I correct?"
28103,bartlet,"Well, then we'd have to call it something else, wouldn't we?Toby sits down and puts his  hand under his chin."
28104,bartlet,"If I cook it inside the turkey, is there a chance I could kill my guests? I'm not saying  that's necessarily a deal-breaker."
28105,bartlet,"All right. Well, first of all, I think you made the second bacteria up, and second of all,  how do I avoid it?"
28106,bartlet,Excellent! Let's talk temperature.
28107,bartlet,"No, see, I was testing you! The USDA calls for turkeys to be cooked to an internal temperature  of 180 to 185 degrees."
28109,bartlet,Oh yeah. It was presented to me as a gift from the personal sous chef to the king of...   auto sales in... 
28111,bartlet,"Fargo. Phil Baharnd. The man can sell a car like... well, like anything."
28112,bartlet,"And you do, too. Thanks a lot!  That was excellent!  We should do that once a week."
28114,bartlet,I gotta get better at the names.
28115,bartlet,"No. One more thing left. Today, we find the traitor in my family. I know the First Lady  doesn't like to schlep, but would you please tell her to meet me in the residence?"
28118,josh,I need to ask you something.
28120,josh,"What am I missing? Why does the White House care so much about an issue involving a  local DA which, at best, should be handled by Justice and State and the Embassy?"
28124,josh,Why do we care about the Bishop of Rome?
28128,josh,The Bishop of Rome is the Pope?
28132,josh,That means getting the DA to guarantee he won't seek the death penalty.
28140,josh," Well, I suppose there's a time for scrouples and a time for, you know."
28152,josh,I need a layover in Atlanta.
28154,josh,And I need to get there about an hour before an 8:00 flight would take off.
28156,josh," I hadn't done the math. I'm also gonna need some information on the DeKalb  County DA, whose name is Farragut. Do me a favor, start with a recent photograph.  And call my mother and tell her I'm gonna be late."
28161,toby,I should be able to at least fire paintballs at you while you do that. 
28163,toby,"Well what if we just recaliberate it to me everyone over 20,000 rich and everyone  under 20,000 middle class?"
28178,c.j.,"No, about what? It's a lawyer and a Michigan wolverine. I think we can take them.  We always do. "
28179,c.j., I'll be there in a minute.
28183,toby," Listen, the OMB's gonna come out with a recommendation for a new way to  calculate the poverty level."
28184,toby,"No. But the formula raises the poverty level 2,000 in change."
28185,toby,"20,000 a year. The problem is we're without a campaign and with 4 million new poor people."
28187,toby," We're working on that one, too."
28189,toby,What the hell are you--
28190,toby," No, I've got neices and nephews and... we'll meet Monday on this, okay?"
28192,josh,"Could I get a ginger ale, please? "
28193,josh,"Excuse me, you're Mark Farragut, right? I'm Josh Lyman."
28195,josh,"No, my mom lives in Florida.  But just technically."
28197,josh,"The Italians aren't worried about the governor, Mark. They're worried about you."
28198,josh,You don't have a defendant.
28199,josh,I know. 'Cause the Georgia 4th is tough enough for a Democrat without appearing as  if he's against the death penalty.
28200,josh,"I said appearing. The only way to combat that is with TV time. You are planning on  running again, right?"
28201,josh,"You raised $232,000 in four months, but then the well dried up after you prosecuted a  corporate polluter and got stuck as anti-business. You were left with 41,500 for the  last two months and that was the ball game."
28202,josh,"  Guarantee you won't seek the death penalty, and you'll have endless media to explain it  to your district."
28203,josh,"Well, in a manner of speaking."
28204,josh,"Yeah, three of them. None of them local. Do it, I'm telling ya, and all three of them  will take your call."
28212,bartlet,"Yeah, sorry about that. Listen, I'm sorry about this, too, but we have to change plans."
28214,bartlet,We're gonna have dinner here at the White House. Charlie's calling everybody.
28223,bartlet,I've got polling numbers.
28226,bartlet,"J'accuse, mon petite fromage!"
28228,bartlet,Nothing's wrong with my French.
28232,bartlet,And what part are you leaving out now?
28236,bartlet, You know what? It was.
28238,bartlet,"Well, with the ingredients for stuffing, you have to cook them before you put them in the  turkey, and you're not gonna know whether I did or not."
28241,c.j.,How many treaties have we signed with the Munsee Indians?
28242,c.j.,How many have we revoked?
28243,c.j.,What were the Munsees doing in 1778?
28244,c.j.,And why aren't you in New York anymore?
28245,c.j.,And whose land was it in the first place.
28246,c.j.," I'm gonna have the park police escort you from the building, it'll take me a  few minutes, so you can make whatever calls you need to make. Or, you can come back to  my office right now, we'll make an appointment for Monday and the White House will cover  your expenses. "
28249,c.j., How do you keep fighting these smaller injustices  when they're all from the Mother of Injustices?
28252,c.j.,About the President being sued?
28253,c.j.,"Okay, that's all everybody. I'll see you at five."
28254,c.j.,"You haven't heard anything about that, have you?"
28255,c.j.,About the President being sued?
28258,toby,"There's a group, a veterans' group that's talking about not showing up for the anniversary."
28261,c.j.,Why aren't they going to show up?
28262,toby,They're talking about not showing up.
28265,c.j.,Do you know anything about the President being sued?
28267,c.j.,Katie Witt seems to think there was an item in the Rocky Mountain News.
28268,toby,I thought it was the Bugler.
28270,toby,I don't know anything about it.
28273,toby,Have you set up a meeting for me?
28274,toby,With the veterans' group?
28275,toby,The one that's talking about not coming?
28276,toby,"You haven't yet, have you?"
28280,toby,Did you get this from the Rocky Mountain?
28284,toby,You can't sue the President.
28286,toby,It's not going to be a big deal.
28291,toby,"Morning, Mr. President."
28292,bartlet,"Come with me for a second, would you?"
28293,toby,"Sir, it's possible you're going to hear some stuff about seatbelts today. I urge you to  ignore it."
28294,bartlet,No problem. Are you straightening things out with the Smithsonian?
28296,bartlet,"I'm supposed to speak at the opening of an exhibit marking the sixtieth anniversary  of Pearl Harbor, but there's a small veterans' group that objects to the exhibit on  the grounds that it's America bashing."
28303,toby,"There's no way I'll remember that, can you send someone a memo?"
28304,toby,This is in exchange for a five-year lease.
28305,bartlet,The point is that we've dotted the I's and we're ready to announce.
28307,bartlet,Let C.J. know but have her pass it off to the DoD.
28310,toby,But passing it off to another department is usually our way of signaling we don't want  the public to care about it.
28311,bartlet,"I don't know, every time we make one of these deals with a place like Qumar I feel  the women around here look at me funny."
28312,toby,I think you're probably wrong about that.
28313,bartlet,You think it's just guilt?
28315,bartlet,Well how should I deal with guilt?
28319,bartlet,"C.J.'s going to be cool with this, right?"
28320,toby,C.J.'s the one you're worried about?
28321,bartlet,"I'm just saying she knows who the good guys are, right?"
28324,toby,"Thank you, Mr. President."
28327,josh,Could I get five minutes without being interrupted by banality?
28331,josh, A little head's up wouldn't be out of line.
28333,josh,"What can I do for you, ma'am?"
28335,josh,"Yeah, I was cc'd on that letter."
28337,josh," Amy Gardner's always irate about something, I wouldn't give it a  lot of thought."
28339,josh,"Me too, and I think it deserves a lot of thought."
28343,josh,"Honestly, ma'am, due respect, I think they're overreacting. We're talking about one word."
28345,josh,I don't know how dramatically...
28349,josh,"Well, I suppose that's for prosecutors to..."
28351,josh,You've spoken with her?
28369,c.j.,A pig-picking festival?
28370,c.j.,More and more I'm in favor of English being the national language.
28372,c.j.,"Thank you, Santa. How about...?"
28373,toby,It's pretty hard to get at the pork when the Chairman's hogging the trough.
28375,toby,You better be briefed on the arms sale to Qumar cause the Pentagon leaked it.
28379,toby,No. We lease an air base in Qumar. It's a ten-year lease and it's up and they won't  renew without an arms package. Are you writing this down?
28380,c.j.,"No, when did we make an arms deal with Qumar?"
28381,toby,I really don't know. What does it matter?
28388,c.j.,Don't start?! What the hell...?
28396,toby,And aren't lawsuits against the President the tort equivalent of insane?
28398,toby,Like the guy who's suing the President to stop CIA-sponsored radio transmissions  in his bridgework?
28400,toby,Or the guy who's suing to have the man from the planet Xanadu removed from his front yard?
28402,toby,It's federal. There's the couple suing for repayment of all back taxes ever because taxes  are unconstitutional.
28406,toby,And the bow-tie manufacturer from the garment district who blames the falling market on  the fact that the President doesn't wear bow-ties.
28410,toby,You think murder is going to overtake education and health care on the campaign trail?
28414,toby,"Wait, wait, better yet. Why doesn't he set up his own checkpoint on I-95?"
28416,toby, So's twisting national policy over a non-story.
28420,bartlet,Did the Celtics win last night?
28421,bartlet,"Okay, when I say did they win, you can just say yes or no."
28423,bartlet,"I'm not on you, I'm just asking."
28424,bartlet,Modern American history sucks.
28425,bartlet,"You want to study history, study the Crusades, the fall of the Roman Empire from  Theoddoseus to Justinian."
28426,bartlet,Damn right the Visigoths. Modern history's another name for television.
28427,bartlet,Is there any way I can help?
28428,bartlet,"I'm a master of modern history, you can ask me anything."
28431,bartlet,They said you needed to see me.
28435,c.j.,"Good morning, Mr. President."
28438,bartlet,"Oh man, they got it again?"
28444,bartlet,Do we say anything in the meantime?
28446,c.j.,"I think we have to. I put the Secretary in the briefing room with experts from the  University of Maryland, the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, they lay out  the facts, soften up the ground."
28450,c.j.,We also don't know how many people know about this already.
28452,c.j.,"There's at least a rancher who knows, the labs in Iowa and England, whoever the USDA..."
28456,bartlet,"The second we say positive, beef futures collapse, and we lose 3.6 billion in beef exports.  Fast food is deserted, supermarkets pull beef, it's panic - I want to talk to some more  people, but in the meantime, we wait."
28458,c.j.,"Thank you, Mr. President."
28461,c.j.,"Want to see panic, let the story break on CNN."
28463,c.j.,I don't know how many more times we can get caught keeping a secret.
28469,c.j.,"Not for nothing, but three weeks ago a woman in Qumar was executed for adultery. She didn't  need a lawyer 'cause there wasn't any trial, it was her husband's word against hers."
28471,c.j.,Later today I'm going to be announcing that we're selling them tanks and guns.
28474,josh,This is interesting art on the walls. A lot of very strong women who could hurt me.
28480,josh,A map of global trafficking in prostitution?
28482,josh,"It's your State Department, too, Amy."
28483,josh,"Yeah, every time you write a letter to the First Lady she gets into gear because she  feels guilty that she's not doing enough for women."
28484,josh,And what would you like?
28485,josh,Not half as glad as I am.
28489,josh,How is that not forced prostitution?
28491,josh, What the hell are those?
28494,josh,We can't drop the one word.
28495,josh,"Because we're not the only ones living in the world. Prostitution is legal in Germany,  Turkey, the Netherlands, and if we alienate these countries..."
28496,josh,The more countries who sign the treaty the more effective it is.
28497,josh,That's a permeating syllogism to be sure .
28498,josh,Who else are you going to vote for?
28502,josh,The art around here scares the hell out of me.
28503,toby,Good morning. Thanks for waiting.
28505,toby,Tell me why I'm talking to you.
28506,toby,And why is that making veterans unhappy?
28507,toby,"They're not attending anymore, they're boycotting."
28508,toby,"Well, the President's speaking at the opening, so it's a bit of a problem because these  guys aren't going to keep their unhappiness to themselves. I don't care if there are  2,000 or 20, I don't want the President where there are pissed-off veterans."
28509,toby,Tell me what they're going to tell me when I meet with them this afternoon.
28512,toby,And you say so in the commentary?
28514,toby,"How about the exhibit titled ""America's Vengeance?"""
28515,toby,"""Vengeance"" is pretty provocative, especially when followed by the burnt contents of a  child's lunch box? Of course I've reviewed the material."
28523,toby,We should keep it to ourselves.
28554,josh,It's bluster. The appointments aren't going to be held up. At least not by Lady Godiva.
28556,josh,"No, she was, yeah. I'm saying, if she wants to front off it's not like there's a moral  imperative for the White House to get behind, what?"
28558,josh,Equity and insurance coverage for contraception or whatever it is the ladies want.  More money for sewing notions and whatnot.
28560,josh,"If she wants to throw heat, we can hold back a few months on the backing for the  Child Support Enforcement Act."
28562,josh,"Of course I don't want to do that, Donna, I'm a friend of the working mom."
28572,josh,That we condone prostitution?
28574,josh,It can't be spun that way.
28578,josh,"All right. All right, would you check if C.J.'s in her office?"
28579,toby,"Well I don't know what 'me of all people' means, but..."
28580,toby,I'm not. This is different from the NEA.
28581,toby,"It is. For one thing, the President's being asked to speak, which is the only reason  I can have you sitting here in the first place. Listen, uh, something's come up, and  I'm done if you're done, so..."
28582,toby,I appreciate yours. Can I call later today?
28586,josh,So I just came from seeing Amy Gardner.
28588,josh,I showed her who's boss.
28589,c.j.,Who'd it turn out to be?
28590,josh,"It's still unclear, but let me ask you something. The UN treaty, Vienna. If we have to  make a to-do about it being forced prostitution, isn't there a chance it could be spun  that we're condoning prostitution?"
28594,josh,Cause Amy'll make it happen.
28596,josh,"Well, this is a whole new thing then..."
28601,c.j.,There was a presumptive positive on some cattle in Nebraska.
28603,c.j.,We have to wait 72 hours for a test.
28604,josh,You're talking about a disease?
28610,josh,"Oh my god, you're kidding me!"
28612,josh,I guess if the door's closed we're not saying anything yet?
28613,toby,That's what we're here to talk about.
28615,c.j.,You know we have an extra 1.5 billion dollars we weren't counting on?
28617,c.j.,"There's an extra 1.5 billion. In Qumar, when a woman gets raped, she'll generally get  beaten by her husband and sons as a punishment so at some point we should talk about  how to spend the 1.5 billion they're giving us."
28618,c.j.,"Okay, so, should we tell anybody?"
28619,bartlet, All right. Unfunded mandates.
28621,bartlet,Don't give me their grumbles.
28622,bartlet,Are employees in wheelchairs supposed to work in the parking lot?
28623,bartlet,How much would it cost the federal government to amend the unfunded mandates we format  to cover all unfunded mandates?
28624,bartlet,Let's find out for sure then tell Siegel to sit down and shut up.
28627,bartlet,"So paint a picture for me, would you?"
28631,bartlet,That's the live cattle. What about the beef?
28633,bartlet,That's a hundred and fifty billion dollar industry. What's the West going to do for a living?
28635,bartlet,People have known about this disease; they're still eating beef in record numbers.
28637,bartlet,"And then the corn and soybean growers, right?"
28641,bartlet,"So we've got frightened parents, rising food prices, public panic, massive layoffs,  and something we've never had to worry about before, we're wondering when the next  case is gonna happen. The most costly disruptions..."
28643,bartlet,Always happen when something we take completely for granted stops working for a minute.
28647,bartlet,"Oh, hey - do you know when we passed the Clean Water Act?"
28649,bartlet,How could you not know that?
28658,bartlet,History can't be reduced to dates and names.
28659,bartlet,"Nah. I'm starting you out with a copy of the speech George Perkins March used in 1845  to rouse the agricultural community of Rutland, Vermont. Then you're going to need to  study on the word ""ecology,"" as coined by the German biologist Ernst Heikl."
28660,bartlet," Better in the original German, of course, but obviously the  translation will be fine."
28679,josh,My tax dollars hard at work.
28681,josh,"Say Donna, you've worked as a prostitute."
28685,josh,Why should what you do be against the law?
28687,josh,"You're not selling yourself, you're renting out your body. "
28689,josh,Don't fashion models do it every day?
28691,josh,"It's only different because we say it's different. When you get a massage, isn't it just  a matter of degrees?"
28693,josh,Wouldn't legalizing prostitution allow women to unionize and get access to social services  and health care benefits and create some control over the industry?
28699,toby,"Okay, round two. I'm Toby Ziegler, I'll be your referee."
28701,toby,Welcome to the White House.
28703,toby,"I don't think the President is available for pictures today, but I can check."
28704,toby,Leave me his information on a piece of paper. I can make a phone call for you.
28705,toby,Okay. Tell me the point you find most offensive and would like to see pulled from the exhibit.
28706,toby,What's at the top of the list?
28707,toby,Well you don't want to ignore the effects of the bomb.
28709,toby,"Well there's some evidence to suggest that Marshall told Truman that and some estimates  say 150,000. Some say 268,000."
28710,c.j.,There are discrepancies.
28711,toby,I didn't see you there. 
28715,c.j.,I just came by to listen.
28716,toby," Before I forget, I want to put you three in a room with  the exhibit directors from the Smithsonian. Can I do it today?"
28717,toby,Stay by a phone.  Okay.
28718,c.j.,"Can I interrupt for a second, Toby?"
28720,c.j.,"Mr. Ramsey, I saw on your information you were in the 10th Armored Division."
28721,c.j.,"You fought in the battle of the bulge, sir."
28722,c.j.,That was a hell of a moment.
28723,c.j.,Can I ask you to imagine something?
28724,c.j.,"Imagine if you weren't as successful as you were. Imagine, say, that Hitler had taken  Antwerp and we'd lost the Battle of the Bulge and Germany held the western front."
28725,c.j.,"No, but even if the Russians had kicked them out of Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria, they could  have held onto France, maybe kept Italy, certainly they could have defended Germany."
28726,c.j.,"Now it's six decades later, and while they didn't conquer Europe the Nazis exist as a  recognized government in some small corner of the European union."
28730,c.j.,"You're protesting because you think the Smithsonian isn't paying proper respect to what  you and the soldiers of the 10th Armored, 3rd Army risked and lost your lives for six  decades ago. How would you feel, in the hypothetical I just described, if I told you that  at my press briefing at the end of the day I was announcing that we were selling tanks,  missiles, and fighter jets to the Nazis?"
28731,toby,Excuse me.  Step outside.
28733,c.j.,"You know, if I was living in Qumar I wouldn't be able to say ""Shove it up your ass, Toby.""  But since I'm not, shove it up your ass, Toby."
28734,bartlet,You really wanna talk about the lawsuit in Colorado?
28736,bartlet,"You hear about the lawyer who opened a chain of dry cleaners? ""Press your lawsuit while  you wait?""  There was a better joke in there someplace, right?"
28739,bartlet,Doctrine of Sovereign Immunity. You can't sue the king. We brought it over from England.
28741,bartlet,Forgot to bring that one over.
28743,bartlet,The RNC has a press conference when I sneeze.
28745,bartlet,Congress won't pass it.
28747,bartlet,"People know where I stand. If they don't know, they can ask me."
28749,bartlet,"And I was for it then. Never did anything about it because nobody wanted it. And, frankly,  why waste time in Capitol?"
28751,bartlet,I can't be responsible every time somebody irrationally twists my meaning. People are  responsible for themselves. 
28752,bartlet,"Today's cars are safer than they've ever been. They've all got air bags, they've all got  seatbelts, and they're all crash tested from here to Tuesday. All that's left is personal  behavior and bad luck, and, I'm not responsible for either one. And, Sam, if Mrs. Landingham w as here right now, she'd say the exact same thing. You know what I'm saying?"
28754,bartlet,"I don't blame this woman for suing me. I'm not a king, and I'm not sure the law should  treat me like one. Though certainly for the moment I don't mind. I'm not blaming her.  She's got to go someplace with her grief and her anger. The ones who should be horsewhipped  with a horsewhip are the ones exploiting her grief for political gain, and I'm not getting  down with those guys."
28756,bartlet, Let Congress pass that law. I'll sign it.
28757,bartlet," Yeah, let's go. Get Leo."
28760,toby,"Good evening, Mr. President."
28761,bartlet,Isn't there a joke to be had with lawsuits and dry cleaners? I've been working on it all day.
28762,josh,"You've been working on other stuff though too, right?"
28767,bartlet,"Okay, what do we think? When do you tell the public what you know?"
28768,c.j.,I think it's right now.
28769,toby,And I think it's when you know something. I think absolute confirmation has to be the rule  when we're talking about public panic.
28770,josh,"Are we sure there's gonna be public panic if we're only saying there's a chance? We think  maybe, usually it's negative."
28771,toby,"I do. 'Cause we're not talking about sushi, it's hamburgers. I'm not kidding around,  it's... these things. The everyday things. The everyday American things. The 99 cent things  that, when you suddenly have to be afraid of them, strike at the center of our equilibrium."
28773,c.j.,"Yeah, what we say now is gonna be measured against the facts, the consequenses of which will  be far worse if we don't say anything and it goes the other way."
28775,c.j., Then pretend for a moment that the cow has MS.
28776,toby,"No, I don't think I will."
28777,bartlet, Something going on with them?
28779,c.j.,"That was a bad analogy, I apologize. What I meant was that the public will not forgive a  President who withheld information that could have helped them or saved lives. Second,  in a crisis, people need to feel like soldiers, not victims. Third, information breeds  confidence. Silence breeds fear. That's my argument. "
28780,bartlet, If it comes from the President--
28781,toby,It shouldn't come from the President.
28783,josh,It should come from Health and Human Services.
28785,bartlet,"All right, that's what we'll do then."
28787,bartlet,What's going on with the Smithsonian?
28789,bartlet,Where are you leading them?
28790,toby,"Not to turn a blind eye to the dark points of history, for sure, but I think there's a  time and place for that, and this isn't it."
28794,toby,"A very, very little bit."
28796,toby,"Uh, Mr. President? Could you point me in the right direction on something? One of the vets  who was here has a buddy whose wheelchair's falling apart. Who can get something done  overnight at Medicaid?"
28797,bartlet,"Ah, Toby. We've gotta straighten out Medicaid."
28799,bartlet,"You know, after the Civil War, veterans had to come to D.C. to get their pensions? They had  to visit the office personally. They waited for a clerk to look through all the Civil War  records until their papers were found. You know what their papers were bound with?"
28801,bartlet,Red tape. That's where it comes from.
28803,bartlet,Go and apologize to C.J. for whatever you did. 
28810,bartlet,"It was interesting, but what?"
28812,bartlet,"Hey, I forgot. Get the information from Toby, I'll make the call myself."
28813,bartlet,Get the information. Get the director of the CMSO on the phone.
28815,bartlet,Is when we passed the Clean Water Act.
28816,bartlet,You know nothing about the Visigoths.
28819,josh,"I went up to your office, and they said you were here. Eleanor Roosevelt once made a  speech to the UN General Assembly saying that we should decriminalize prostitution."
28820,josh, The Undersecretary for Global Affairs and Regina Pierce are gonna sit  with our legal advisor at the UN and look at some alternative language.
28823,josh,How's making prostitution illegal not supressing women's rights?
28824,josh,"It is, but heroin's bad for you."
28825,josh,How am I not supposed to call you a hypocrite when you say that the government shouldn't  tell women what to do with their bodies.
28826,josh,But the profit goes to the women.
28827,josh,But the guys who breaks into my apartment and steals my stereo does it for the same reason.
28828,josh,"Yeah, because he broke into my apartment and stole my stereo, and nobody wants that to  happen to them. But you can't say that about the other thing. "
28829,josh,"Forget, for a second, that it's a women's issue. The law isn't a deterrent.  Prostitutes advertise in the yellow pages."
28830,josh,Aren't we just serving to create more criminals in a criminal environment?
28832,josh,To tell you about the thing.
28836,josh,Your office is on the way home.
28844,josh,Why are we talking about this?
28845,josh,I'm a visible guy. People say things about me. People write things. And what I do reflects  on the President.
28847,josh,What's the thing about guys like me? 
28848,josh, What's the thing with guys like me?
28852,josh," What are you, fifteen years old? You almost hit me in the head!"
28854,c.j.,"Well, this isn't the point, but we will. Of course we will. Of course we'll be fighting  a war with Qumar one day, and you know it, so...well, at least we'll be familiar with the  weapons they're using."
28855,c.j.,"We don't need it, it's convenient."
28856,c.j.,"We don't need it. We've got Turkey, we've got Bahraine, we've got Deigo Garcia.  Qumar's convenient."
28857,c.j.,"They beat women, Nancy. They hate women. The only reason they keep Qumari women alive  is to make more Qumari men."
28858,c.j.,"How about instead of suggesting that we sell the guns to them, suggesting that we shoot  the guns at them? And by the way, not to change the subject, but how are we supposed to  have any moral credibility when we talk about gun control and making sure that guns don't  get in the hands of the wrong people? God, Nancy! What the hell are we defining as the  right people?"
28859,c.j.,"I know about the real world, and I'm not suggesting we isolate them."
28861,c.j.,I'm not suggesting anything. I don't suggest foreign policy around here.
28862,c.j.,"It's the twenty-first century, Nancy. The world's gotten smaller. I don't know how we can  tolerate this kind of suffering anymore, particularly when all it does is continue the cycle  of anti-American hatred. But that's not the point, either."
28863,c.j.,"The point is that apartheid was an Easthampton clambake compared to what we laughingly refer  to as the life these women lead. And if we had sold M1-A1s to South Africa fifteen years ago,  you'd have set the building on fire. Thank God we never needed to refuel in Johannesburg!"
28864,c.j.," They're beating the women, Nancy!"
28865,c.j.,"Good evening. We have two birthdays today, so we have cake. One cake. It's nice to share.  Quickly, before I take questions, a late edition to Monday's schedule, the President will be  at the opening of the Smithsonian exhibit commemorating the sixtieth anniversary of the  attack on Pearl Harbor. That's three in the afternoon, and I'll have more information  Monday morning. Labor Secretary Carl Reed will brief from this podium in one hour's time  on our school-to-work initiative, and, let me check, yeah, while that's going on, there'll  be a briefing at the Department of Health and Human services by USDA director David Rhinegold.  Sometime Tuesday you'll be briefed at the Pentagon. The DOD will be annoucing that we've  renewed our lease another ten years with the Khalifa Airbase in Qumar. I understand they've  promised to paint and add new carpet. "
28875,josh,New threats were made in Tennessee this morning. 
28881,josh,"Yeah, keep your head there, would you? Don't call during every break and check in.  Keep your head there. "
28887,josh,There are ways to get the guy out of the room. 
28889,josh,"I used to do this for a living, Leo. The guy gets the floor for five minutes. I can  get him out of the room. "
28891,josh,"I'm going to help you, 'cause you know why? "
28893,josh,"No, Leo, no. It's 'cause a guy is walking down the street and he falls into a hole, see. "
28909,bartlet," Listen, I don't care that much about your ass but if you need to perjure  yourself to protect me you're going to damn well do it. "
28911,bartlet,"Whatever it is Josh does, you're going to let him do it. "
28913,bartlet,"Yeah, yeah. How does she look to you? "
28921,bartlet,I like you and her. It's like a '50s screwball comedy 
28925,bartlet,I'm not doing anything tomorrow night. 
28929,bartlet,"Yeah. Actually, nobody does. "
28931,bartlet,You got about a thousand people in this building standing with you right now. 
28945,bartlet,"Thomas Hilton started a fishing village here in 1623, Allen. "
28947,bartlet,And a slogan's going to do that? 
28949,bartlet,"Oh, oh, slow down, you're going too fast. "
28950,bartlet,$367 million in snowmobiling? 
28951,bartlet, And the goggles... That includes the goggles? 
28952,bartlet,"Okay. Thanks, guys.  Mrs. Landingham! Thanks. "
28953,bartlet,Speaking of crusty New England relics...
28954,bartlet,Nah. Abbey wants to eat at Patsy's tonight. Would you let them know we're coming? 
28960,bartlet,Jenny and Mallory are okay? 
28962,bartlet,What are you doing here? 
28964,bartlet,What are you doing...? 
28970,bartlet,Where are you staying? 
28972,bartlet,What do you want to talk to me about? 
28974,bartlet,"I think that's great, man. I think it's about time. You probably mean the House, but I  think you should consider the Senate seat in Illinois in two years; I can help raise money. "
28976,bartlet,"Hey, Leo, I swear to God there's no one I'd rather see in the Oval Office than you but  if you run there's going to be a lot of discussion about Valium and Alcohol. I mean,  it's going to come out; this is the world. "
28980,bartlet,"What? Leo takes a napkin out of his pocket, licks it, and sticks it on the posterboard  easel. It reads ""Bartlet for America."" "
28996,josh,"17-month investigation, 34 black churches. How can there be no evidence of a conspiracy? "
28999,josh,You met with Leo this morning? 
29000,josh,"All right, well, let's listen in on this meeting for a minute. "
29004,bartlet,"Well, the phone calls have been coming all morning, Governor. You should know that Algiss  Skyler called. "
29005,bartlet,Skyler wants to know why the hell you haven't. 
29006,bartlet,Was Eisenhower wrong in '57? Kennedy in '61? 
29007,bartlet,"We don't know what the situation is, do we, Josh? "
29008,josh,"No, sir. Mr. President, this is Special Agent Mike Casper who's acting as the FBI's White  House liaison during this situation. "
29009,bartlet,"Do we know what's going on, Agent Casper? "
29010,bartlet,"Edward, so far the churches have been empty. There have been no fatalities. But tomorrow  night's Christmas Eve. They're going to be packed. So why shouldn't I send troops in? "
29011,bartlet,This doesn't happen in New Hampshire. 
29012,bartlet,"We'll meet again this afternoon. Thank you, Governor. "
29015,bartlet,"So, what have you got cooking? "
29017,bartlet,"I said, what have you got cooking? "
29019,bartlet,"Yes, you do. I know what happened at the third debate. He told me. I know what's going to  happen this afternoon. What are you going to do? Are you going to try and get Gibson out  of the room when it's his turn to question? "
29020,josh,"I don't think you and I should discuss it, sir. "
29022,bartlet,"Abbey's about to get spanked. Guys, the things we do to women. My wife's a world-class  scientist. "
29030,toby,You got to pop the ball. You got to pop it. 
29039,toby,It's when Wiley drops out and he's running against Hoynes. 
29042,c.j.,Can we get an intern over here? 
29044,toby,"Yeah, and we should start projecting the image that he thinks he's for real. "
29045,c.j.,"We'll release his tax returns, put all his stocks in a blind trust. "
29049,c.j.,Absolutely. He's got ten years on Hoynes. We should release a medical report. 
29059,bartlet,"Listen, they want me to do some things before South Dakota."
29061,bartlet,"Yeah, we're lookin' past that."
29063,bartlet,Full financial disclosure...
29065,bartlet,They want me to take a physical. 
29066,bartlet,What's a physical right now gonna show?
29068,bartlet," I'm not lying to anybody, Abbey. I'm taking a physical - a physical which  I'm under no legal obligation to take. I'm doing it voluntarily."
29070,bartlet,"Now is when people are listening. I'll make my speeches, get whooped on Super Tuesday,  and we'll all go home."
29071,bartlet, The things we do to women.
29076,josh, I wasn't there. I heard about it.
29078,josh,"It was you, Toby, and C.J."
29080,josh,I need somebody in the steel lobby to speak to Darren Gibson right away - sometime toward  the end of this hour.
29082,josh,Jim Jericho's who I had. He had to leave town. His wife is sick. Who else do we have?  One of our people?
29087,josh, You'll get a guy for me?
29109,bartlet," All right, let's do it."
29114,bartlet,I'd like you to be the Vice-President.
29115,bartlet,"Why don't you sit with Abbey and me for a few minutes.  Can I have the  room, please?"
29116,bartlet, You want anything? Coffee or anything?
29117,bartlet,You ran a good campaign.  You're a young man. You'll be back.
29118,bartlet,"There's something you need to know. It's why I asked everyone to leave the room.   A few years ago, I was diagnosed with a relapsing remitting course of MS."
29121,bartlet,I told you because it's something you're gonna need to know. But also because I wanted to show  that I trust you.
29123,bartlet," Well, what do you say?"
29124,bartlet," I'd like your answer now, John."
29125,bartlet,I'm gonna stretch my legs.
29126,josh,"If you could please give him that message as soon as he gets in or, you know, when he returns  the page. Cindy, if I could tell you what it's regarding I'd have told you. Sorry. Thank you. "
29132,josh,He didn't maybe drop off a piece of paper with a name on it? 
29136,josh,President's going to make a decision right now. We got to... What? 
29141,josh,We got ourselves a conspiracy. 
29143,josh,To brief the President.
29144,josh,"Mike, that's your task force out there. The only reason you're not out there with them is  'cause-- I don't know-- 'cause you're a woman or something. "
29146,josh,You'll take a handshake. Let's go.
29149,josh,Your decision just got a lot easier. 
29152,bartlet,"All right. Here come the Tennessee Volunteers. Reverend, have the pastors encourage the  women to bake those guys something nice. They're all spending Christmas Eve where they  don't want to be. Ed, you get to be a hero to the blacks in your state. Anybody in your  state doesn't like it the FBI is calling the shots. What could you do? Anything else? "
29153,bartlet,I'm sorry. I've forgotten your name. 
29155,bartlet,A two-year investigation gets its first crack from a broken taillight.
29156,bartlet,"God, well, some of the stupidest criminals in the world are working right here in America.  I've always been very proud of that. "
29157,bartlet,"Thank you, Agent Casper. "
29159,josh,"I got to call him and tell him, you know- "
29160,bartlet,It's not going to happen? 
29162,bartlet,"It was a long shot, anyway. Look, I wanted to see him spared this but Leo's made out of  leather. His face has a map of the world on it. Leo comes back. "
29174,josh,Leo... I couldn't make it happen.
29190,bartlet," It won't be later. This is a 550 seat theater and they'll be seated a  half-hour before we start, so the temperature'll be up four to six degrees."
29199,josh, I'd still like to go over the Social Security answer. We gotta get it  down to 90 seconds.
29200,c.j.,It's down to 90 seconds.
29201,josh,It's not - and they're gonna cut him off.
29203,josh,"When he speeds up, he speeds up. When he doesn't... It's 90 seconds. We need to cut some more."
29205,josh,"Governor, what do you think? Governor?"
29206,josh,"Sir, we were just saying on the Social Security answer..."
29208,josh,"...it's a tight ninety seconds, and..."
29210,josh," Well, we gotta do it now, sir."
29217,c.j.,Let me get some water. 
29219,toby,"He's saying, ""Get Abbey."""
29224,josh," Leo, the Governor's sick."
29226,josh, He collapsed. You gotta get down here.
29257,bartlet, Which is more than I can say for me in Rosslyn.
29259,bartlet,Did you get a date with her?
29261,bartlet,I did the church thing in Tennessee okay. I did it without you.
29263,bartlet,"So anyway, I have a present for you."
29265,bartlet,That was awfully nice of you.
29302,c.j.,I usually don't know that. 
29305,josh,Are we taking this a little too seriously? 
29307,josh,He was a White House photographer. He was fired. My recollection is that he was a buffoon. 
29309,josh,So what are you saying? 
29311,c.j.,"It was miniature golf, wasn't it? "
29312,toby,"Yeah. Sam, got anything else? "
29316,josh,"Listen. You know Amy Gardner, right? "
29317,toby,Women's Leadership Coalition. 
29320,josh,"I've know her for a while, actually. She went out with my roommate in college. "
29322,josh,I saw her a couple of weeks ago about some language in the Vienna Treaty. 
29324,josh,Mrs.Bartlet sent me there. 
29326,josh,"I don't know, she changed her hair or something. Something's going on. "
29328,josh,"Well, I'm a straight shooter. I think my record's pretty clear on that. "
29330,josh,I'd like to see her again. 
29334,josh,"No, no. 'Cause there's a potential she says no and then I have to move someplace where  it'll never be spoken of again. "
29336,josh,I need to come in under the cover of business. 
29337,toby,'Cause you're a straight shooter. 
29338,josh,"Yeah. I need a point of friction. An issue where the feministas and the White House  disagree. That way, I can go to, her break the bad news, stand tough, smooth it over  and then, you know, I take it from there. "
29339,toby,"How about the word ""feministas""? "
29340,josh,"Nah. Come on, you've been doing outreach to the women's groups on the State of the  Union-- where are we? "
29344,josh,With the surplus projections changing? 
29345,toby,Women are getting a decent break. 
29346,josh,Damn-- where the hell are the pro-lifers when you need them? 
29347,toby,"Sons of bitches, don't they know you're trying to get... "
29348,josh,"Hey, this is not that. She's got... I really... I'm... bewitched. I'm ensorcelled.  There's got to be some way we're screwing them over. "
29349,toby,There's an anti-family planning amendment on Raleigh's foreign ops supplemental... 
29350,josh,We killed it in Committee. 
29352,josh,They're the ones who want to wait. 
29353,toby,Breast cancer screenings through Medicare? 
29354,josh,Fully funded. Head Start's okay. What about paid family leave? 
29355,toby,They know it's a dream they don't want us to waste the capital. 
29356,josh,We can't just compromise like that. 
29357,toby,"They want us to compromise, like that. "
29358,josh,They should be outraged. 
29359,toby,"They're not, they just want a study funded. "
29360,josh,How much we putting towards the study? 
29361,toby,Almost everything they asked for. 
29363,toby,"They wanted $21 million, they're getting $20.5. "
29364,josh,"Well, that's practically an insult. "
29366,josh,"Okay. Paid family leave, there it is. "
29367,toby,"Yeah, I'd go with paid family leave. "
29368,josh,Paid family leave. There it is. Okay. 
29371,toby,"Listen. Come here. You're inside, right? "
29373,toby,"You were nervous when he took the stand before the break. So was the President. Then  they called the recess. I don't know what was going on - that's okay, that's the way  somebody wants it. But you're inside, right? "
29375,toby,Good. If it's something Communications is going to have to work with... 
29376,josh,The lawyers are talking about it. 
29377,toby,When I have to know I will. 
29379,toby,Okay. Paid family leave.
29384,bartlet,Weren't you going to a flea market? 
29385,bartlet,You didn't have to do that. 
29387,bartlet,"Look at these topographical details. Seriously, I'm going to have this framed, this is great. "
29388,bartlet,"No, I'm going to play with it some more. "
29390,bartlet,"Look at this map. 1709. The Dead Sea, Jordan River, Mount Sinai. "
29392,bartlet,You want to come inside? 
29394,bartlet,"Thanks again, Charlie. "
29401,bartlet,They didn't offer nothing. 
29405,bartlet,"Well, I get it but see what you can do about it, okay? "
29407,bartlet,"No, I've got a security briefing downstairs. "
29435,toby,No. Hardly any of it's true. 
29437,toby,"Well, my name is Toby Ziegler and I'm the Communications Director though there's a typo  in ""communications"" at one point. Perhaps... "
29439,toby,"Perhaps I mumble from time to time but prickly? I do not think so. Nonetheless, I'm fine  with it. "
29441,toby,I'd really rather not have one over my signature. 
29443,toby,I remember this guy as a not very talented not very pleasant malcontent who wasn't here  very long. Am I remembering the right guy? 
29445,toby,"Yeah, well, I don't want him to know I remember him at all. "
29449,toby,Is there anything in particular? 
29454,toby,"Okay. On Carol's birthday, did you happen to attend a seance where they tried to contact  Margaret's grandmother? No, right? "
29457,bartlet,"Good afternoon, Mr. President. "
29458,bartlet,There seems to be a growing consensus that no one's going to believe I'm serious about  paying down a trillion dollars of the debt when I'm willing to spend $200 billion on  the child poverty fund. 
29459,toby,I agree with the growing consensus. 
29460,bartlet,I'm not saying we're not going to do it. We're just going to find a different way of  saying we're going to do it. 
29463,bartlet,Thank you. What's going on? 
29464,toby,"Well, I guess you should know we have galleys of a book that's coming out in a few weeks.  A kiss-and-tell by a photographer who worked for me for about a half hour. "
29465,bartlet,Fiction or nonfiction? 
29466,toby,"Science fiction, really. "
29468,toby,Everything else is the State of the Union. 
29469,bartlet,"All right. Hey, you want to see something? Charlie gave this to me. It's a map of the  Holy Land, drawn in 1709. He got at a flea market. It's hand-colored, copper engraved.  I was going to put it in the outer office. "
29476,toby,'Cause some people are going to find it offensive. 
29478,toby,It doesn't recognize Israel. 
29483,bartlet,Israel wouldn't happen for another 250 years. 
29485,bartlet,"So, what's the problem with the map? "
29486,toby,Some people are going to find it offensive. 
29488,toby,It doesn't recognize Israel. 
29489,bartlet,"Take lunch, would you? "
29490,toby,"Hey, your favorite movie was on TV last night. "
29491,bartlet,"""By God, I'm 50, alive, and the King all at the same time."" "
29492,toby,"I turned it on just as they got to the scene when Richard, Geoffrey and John were  locked in the dungeon and Henry was coming down to execute them. Richard tells his  brothers not to cower but to take it like men. And Geoffrey says, ""You fool! ""As if  it matters how a man falls down."" And Richard says... "
29493,bartlet,"...it matters a great deal."" "
29494,toby,It matters a great deal. 
29495,bartlet,Are you trying to tell me something? 
29496,toby,"No, Mr. President, of course not. "
29500,josh,I'll take it. I'll take it. That's for me. 
29502,josh," Press hold, and I will pick up the phone in my office. "
29508,josh,Are you wrestling with someone right now? You in the middle of a match or something? 
29509,josh,You spend a lot of time at the gym. 
29511,josh,"Listen, uh, we need to talk about something. "
29512,josh,"Paid family leave. Sorry, there was a dog in here for a second. "
29513,josh,A nice one. It was... uhkay. 
29514,josh,"Well, I-I'd like to talk about this in person. Any chance we could get together? "
29515,josh,Can you have a late dinner tonight? 
29517,josh,"Well, I don't want to bust up your date or anything. "
29542,josh,Has it started snowing yet? 
29556,c.j.,"Good evening, Mr. President. "
29560,c.j.,"Well, this might sound ridiculous. "
29562,c.j.,You know we're trying to vett this book. 
29563,bartlet,I've heard about the book. 
29566,c.j.,"""It is well known in the Bartlet White House that after having two daughters Jed  Bartlet wanted a son and sought advice from the book 'How to Choose the Sex of Your  Baby' by Dr. Landrum B. Shettles. The book recommends that the father-to-be avoid  jockey shorts, jock straps and other tight-fitting clothes."" "
29568,c.j.,"So, I can put you down for a ""no?"" "
29569,bartlet,"When you're going to be a father you're rooting for ten fingers and ten toes, and  that's it. "
29570,c.j.,"Thank you, Mr. President. "
29571,bartlet,Wait. I want to show you this great map Charlie found. 
29572,c.j.,"Sir, I know about it. You can't put it up in the West Wing. "
29573,c.j.,It doesn't recognize Israel. 
29574,bartlet,There was no Israel in 1709. 
29576,bartlet,"So, it's not on the map. "
29577,c.j.,Which is what some people are going to find offensive. 
29579,c.j.,You know what would be great? 
29580,bartlet,If I put it someplace else? 
29582,bartlet,"Leo has--in what used to be his house when he was married--a map of the United States.  The first third of it is the 13 original colonies. The second third of it is the French  territory of Louisiana. And the third third is Mexico. In this map of the United States,  there is not a single state. That's because when this map was made there was no United  States. "
29583,bartlet,I am the President of the United States and I'm not offended by it. 
29584,c.j.,"Well, you're bigger than ten men, sir. What do you say we put it out of the way? "
29585,bartlet,"I'm having it enlarged and bolting it to the hood of my limo. They don't want us to  put up our map, Charlie. They're philistines in the fight for freedom but that doesn't  bother us, does it? "
29587,c.j.,"It's not like I'm agreeing with the people who are going to be offended. It's just  that you're asking for a whole lot of pain, in exchange for which you get nothing  but an old map. "
29588,bartlet,That's the key. An old map. An old map. Spin that. 
29589,c.j.,"See, now you got me out there spinning things. "
29591,c.j.,"You didn't have special underwear, right? "
29593,c.j.,"Thank you, Mr. President."
29609,josh,I know The Nutcracker although I've never been. 
29610,josh,"But I should start with The Nutcracker, right? "
29612,josh,"Well, I've never been to Bosnia either, Amy, and I don't think I'm going to go. "
29614,josh,"Uh, Absolut martini on the rocks. Two olives, please. "
29617,josh,It's not going to happen. 
29618,josh,At least not this year. 
29619,josh,"I mean, we can't even go for it. "
29623,josh,And he likes the ballet? 
29624,josh,I think he likes the ballet. 
29625,josh,Thank you. Thank you for the extra olive. 
29626,josh,Won't catch her at the ballet. 
29627,josh,She seemed smart to me. 
29628,josh,How can you be blase about this? 
29629,josh,The United States is one of only six other countries out of 152 that has no national  policy regarding paid maternal leave. 
29632,josh,But money has been put aside for a study. 
29633,josh,The thing is...and here's the bad news. 
29634,josh,You guys wanted $21 million? 
29635,josh,"It's going to be $20 million 500,000. You want to take my head off, go ahead. "
29636,josh,Things are tight all over. 
29637,josh,"I mean, i-is it possible? I suppose you can say... "
29638,josh,"Hey, you threw a water balloon at me. "
29639,josh,"I don't know, I was just throwing that out there. "
29640,josh,Like there's not a reason you're here right now? 
29641,josh,"All I know is you're here, I'm here and Nijinsky's home watching Leno. "
29643,josh,Do you need me in this conversation or are you okay by yourself? 
29645,josh,"Okay, that's like the fifth time you've said ""guys like you."" "
29647,josh,What's with guys like me? 
29648,josh,"That's not true.  Excuse me. Hello. Donna, I'm kind of in the middle of  something. What were you doing talking to...? Okay, tell him yeah. I have to go. "
29649,josh,I'm sorry. I-I can't explain.  I have to go.
29652,bartlet,Everybody's working late. 
29656,bartlet,The early drafts look good. 
29658,bartlet,"I heard. Look, I'm really not going to talk to you about my underwear. "
29660,bartlet,"No, but I guess that doesn't mean it wasn't. "
29664,bartlet,I don't even remember the meeting. 
29668,bartlet,"I said, ""Why does it matter?"" "
29674,josh,What are you doing down here? 
29676,josh,"Well, I'd like to talk to you about the deal they're offering. "
29678,josh,"There's nobody here, and my voice is down. "
29684,josh,"I'm not pushing you, okay? I just want to hear your reasons. "
29686,josh,"Gets it over and done instead of dragging it through the primary season. Moreover,  you don't take the stand on Monday. "
29694,josh,Guess what. I didn't know that. 
29696,josh,History forgets these things. 
29703,toby,"McDeere shot 1 for 23 from the field last night. Missed his first 18 attempts. Wouldn't  you think after the first 17 misses the coach would say, ""Mickey, this isn't your night""? "
29704,c.j.,You don't have work to do? 
29705,toby,I have a lot of work to do. 
29707,toby,Can't rush these things. 
29709,toby,1 for 23. That's exactly one better than my mother would have done. She's been dead  12 years. 
29723,toby,That's a reasonable question and we should explore that for a minute. 
29727,c.j.," Boy, boy, crazy boy. Keep cool, boy... "
29731,c.j.,"Let me tell you something I've learned in my years. There are victims of fires. There  are victims of car accidents. This kind of thing, there are no victims--just volunteers.  Of course we'll get in the game. I'll talk to the editors of the major papers but we're  not going to publicly refute every bogus charge. First of all, there are too many of them.  Second of all, I'm not going to give this guy and his book the weight of the White House.  As far as the press is concerned I've read the book because I had to. You have a vague  recollection of the guy but he wasn't here long enough to make a lasting impression.  Have you read the book? Of course not. You're too busy doing a job. "
29733,c.j.,"Sam! Once again, we don't know what's going on in the Oval Office. Obviously, there's  a problem. When it's our turn to worry about it they won't be shy about telling us.  Let's not fixate on the nuckleheaded stuff we think we can fix in the meantime. And  it feels a lot like...that's what you're doing. "
29735,toby,Josh is. But let me ask you this. A guy shoots 1 for 23 from the field. 
29737,toby,"Yeah. But he goes 8 for 8 from the foul line. My question is, why are you fouling this  guy at all? I'd just get out of the way and point him toward the basket. "
29739,c.j.,So we're done talking about this now. 
29742,toby,It's out in the refrigerator. 
29746,josh,I paid for the drinks. 
29747,josh,What are you doing here? 
29748,josh,I do. I'm sorry I had to leave quickly before. I still can't tell you why. 
29751,josh,You were having quite a bit of sex with Chris. 
29752,josh,"I studied a lot in school. I studied hard in high school and at Harvard and in law  school. My IQ doesn't break the bank, and I wanted to do this so I studied all the  time. And I missed something or it's like I skipped a year 'cause I never learned  what you do after you think you like somebody-- what you do next. And every-everybody  did learn. A lot of other people, anyway. I didn't walk out tonight. When my phone  rings at 11:00, it's important. Not important to me. Important. And I'm not puffing  myself so-so that you're... "
29755,bartlet,You want to step in for a second? 
29757,bartlet,"Yeah. No. A little bit. Mostly, I've been talking with Babish and some of the deputies.  The Chairman, Trent, the Speaker, the Minority Leader. "
29759,bartlet,"Yeah, I'm going to do it. "
29765,bartlet,There's another reason. 
29767,bartlet,"I was wrong. I was. I was just...I was wrong. Come on, you know that. Lots of times we  don't know what right or wrong is but lots of times we do and come on, this is one.  I may not have had sinister intent at the outset but there were plenty of opportunities  for me to make it right. No one in government takes responsibility for anything anymore.  We foster, we obfuscate, we rationalize. ""Everybody does it."" That's what we say. So we  come to occupy a moral safe house where everyone's to blame so no one's guilty. I'm to  blame. I was wrong. "
29769,bartlet,"As a matter of fact, it's not a Joint Resolution. The President still has to sign a  Joint Resolution so, technically, it's a Concurrent Resolution. House Concurrent  Resolution 172. The lawyers will haggle over the wording in the next few days. So,  at least I'll make history, huh? "
29771,bartlet,He was censured in '34. He got it expunged in '36. 
29773,bartlet,No. Let me ask you something. You may be the last sane voice around here. 
29777,bartlet,"In Lebanon. Not here. It's not like I'm thinking ""God, I was going to recognize Israel,  but now that I've seen this map..."" You know what? Let's just sit here quietly. "
29799,josh,You said not to talk to you.
29810,josh,Still trying to get waived into Generation X?
29811,josh,"Oh, you betcha. See you later."
29833,c.j.,"We should leak in the meantime, soften up the ground?"
29843,c.j.,Should we postpone the State of the Union? What are the rules on that?
29844,toby,"He's required to give Congress information on the State of the Union. If he buys Congress  a subscription to the Wall Street Journal, he's fulfilled his Constitutional..."
29846,c.j.,He's accepting a censure. That is defeat. And you don't ask the school bully out to lunch  the day after he stole your lunch money.
29848,c.j.,You can't spin a formal denunciation from the legislative branch. It spins itself.
29850,c.j.,"It's our biggest press hit of the year, our biggest pre-convention campaign exposure. I  don't know how you make a formal report to Congress when Congress just called you a liar."
29851,josh,I say we strap a polygraph onto the TelePrompTer.
29858,c.j.,What kind of attitude is that?
29859,c.j.,Vanity Fair's pitching my office a story on you.
29861,c.j.,"They want to do a profile, and they want to start the reporting on the night of the State  of the Union."
29863,c.j.,This is their way of doing that. The thing is... you know the writer.
29871,c.j.,When did we have that rule?
29873,c.j.,I think people know about speechwriters.
29875,c.j.,"In the past, you tell me. Did it help or hurt that the campaign had a youthful and  energetic energy?"
29879,c.j.,Do we need help right now? Do young women read Vanity Fair?
29881,c.j.,"They do cover the President. Right now they want you, and I want to give you to them."
29883,c.j.,"Hey, is the reason you guys didn't get married is 'cause her name would have been Lisa  Sherborne Seaborn?"
29885,c.j.,I could do this for a living. 
29916,josh,Can you get me the most recent memo from the DPC on the welfare-to-work initiatives?
29918,josh,I'm seeing Amy again tonight.
29920,josh,"First date really. Last night was more of a, you know..."
29932,josh,"Well, for one thing, the piano player only seems to know one song."
29934,josh,"""Little things with fur better hurry..."""
29938,josh,Whatever. It's like I'm on a hayride.
29941,josh,It was official travel.
29943,josh,What does the rule say?
29947,josh, Just put it on my credit card.
29949,josh,"And damn it, that's my job."
29953,josh,Yes. I need the welfare-to-work memo.
29963,toby,I was happy when you said this morning that you recommended the censure.
29964,josh,Your face didn't register much.
29965,toby,I was thinking about the speech.
29967,toby,Don't ask me how it's going.
29969,toby,It's in the larva stage. You can't rush these things. It's not like putting a hammer  to a nail.  I need some pie.
29970,josh,You should go get some. 
29973,toby,Don't ask me about the speech.
29975,toby,How'd it end up going last night?
29981,toby,You know Amy's seeing somebody.
29984,josh,"No, and I don't want to know. Yes, now that you mention it, who?"
29992,josh,"It's interesting, and I'll tell you why."
29994,josh,Because John Tandy is a...
29995,toby,"I'll tell you why, seriously."
29997,toby,'Cause they started seeing each other shortly after Nan Lieberman announced he was gonna  make a primary challenge in the 20th district.
30001,toby,I don't think he's courting Amy Gardner. I think he's courting women.
30002,josh,I don't think you're right.
30004,josh,'Cause that's ridiculous.
30006,josh,"No. It's not ridiculous. Of course, you're right."
30007,toby," Hey, who's the President having dinner with tonight?"
30009,toby,"Good, 'cause when you're in this kind of mood, having dinner with your wife's friends  is just what you're hoping for."
30011,bartlet,Abbey just went to take a phone call.
30012,bartlet, What did you just say? 
30013,bartlet,Right. The part I understand was Bobby saying we could cure cancer in ten years.
30014,bartlet,"In other words, make it so that people could live with it?"
30015,bartlet,What is standing between us and that happening?
30016,bartlet,Who at this table knows?
30017,bartlet,How much money would it cost?
30019,bartlet,He just said ten years. I want to hear about this from the beginning. Talk to me like  I'm not an oncologist.
30022,toby,So how's it going on the uh... what are you doing?
30024,toby,I can look at it when you're ready.
30026,toby,Lisa's gonna do a piece?
30032,toby, So why didn't you get married?
30037,toby,"Good evening, Mr. President."
30039,bartlet,"I want to call everybody in. I just had dinner with some of Abbey's friends. They're  all oncologists. I think in the State of the Union, I can announce that I'm directing  our researchers to have a cure for cancer in ten years. Call everybody in."
30040,toby,This is about the censure.
30041,josh,I said it for your own good.
30043,josh,Let's look at the facts.
30044,josh,He was polling at 69% among Democrats. And that's all Tandy's got in his district.
30045,josh,"All right. He had a 69% favorability rating with women. You need 93% favorability among  men to beat that, and Mahatma Gandhi doesn't get that in the Florida 20th."
30046,josh,"When Nan Lieberman announces that she might challenge him in the primary, his favorability  goes down to 52%. You know why?"
30047,josh,'Cause women started going over to Lieberman.
30048,josh,Women's groups started hedging saying there aren't enough women in Congress. Tandy needs  women. NOW hasn't endorsed him yet.
30049,josh,"Yes. Still, when did he start going out with you? A week after Lieberman announced."
30050,josh,I know everything. And you are the door to women. The WLC put nine million dollars in the  hands of pro-choice candidates. You narrowed the gap in the House from 14 to nine in one  election. You bring home the bacon.
30052,josh,I don't think I'm getting enough credit for saying this for your own good.
30054,josh,We're changing the sub...
30056,josh,I should just sit here?
30065,toby,The President thinks he can cure cancer.
30066,josh,"Well, that's some good news, I guess."
30067,toby,Yeah. I'll see you in a few minutes.
30068,josh,"Hey, did I hear Toby right on the phone?"
30070,josh,Do the two of you ever go anywhere separately?
30072,josh,What's going on? What was that phone call?
30073,toby,We're gonna meet and talk.  How'd it go?
30074,josh,Not at all well. You know whose fault that is?
30083,toby,"I'm just, you know... I'm just the guy who does the thing."
30086,bartlet,Good evening. Thanks for being here so late.
30087,bartlet,"A President stood up. He said we will land a man on the moon before the end of the  decade. You know what we knew when he said that? Nothing. We didn't know anything.  We didn't know about the lunar surface. We didn't know how to land one of these things.  All we'd ever done is crash it into the ocean. And God knows we could figure out how to  land soft. We didn't know how to blast off again, but a President said we're gonna do it,  and we did it. So I ask you, why shouldn't I stand up and say we are going to cure  cancer in ten years?"
30088,josh,"Well, how close are we to really being able to do this?"
30092,toby,It'll be seen as a political ploy.
30094,c.j.,It can be seen...  It can be seen as self-serving.
30096,c.j.,Using cancer to deflect attention from MS.
30097,bartlet,You think people with cancer care what my motives are? You think their families do?
30100,bartlet,"Once again, why would somebody...?"
30106,bartlet,"I'm sorry. I know it's late, but I want to start seeing drafts of a new section in the  next few hours. C.J., I want a sense of a media overview, too."
30108,bartlet,I just want to look at some drafts.
30109,toby,I don't have an hour and a half to spend on this.
30111,toby,You don't have an hour and a half to spend on it either.
30113,toby,Stopping what we're doing to write about curing cancer?
30115,toby,'Cause it's never gonna be in the speech.
30121,toby,I don't want you spending more than an hour and half. 
30130,josh,Listen... When the hell are we getting numbers?
30131,josh,I hear that a lot. When are we getting numbers?
30133,josh,What in God's name could you possibly want right now?
30138,josh,I have no idea what you just said.
30140,josh,Forgive us for talking to lawyers about the law.
30141,josh,The Minority Whip doesn't work for us.
30143,josh,I'm not quarreling with his credentials as a lover of women. I happen to know he excels  in that area.
30145,josh,I was saying that. I was saying it two weeks ago. Now I'm not saying anything in the  vicinity of that.
30160,bartlet,We'd want to include the Society of Clinical Oncology.
30162,bartlet,The OMB would have to score it. We haven't identified the offsets to pay for it. We can  barely tell them what the it is.
30164,bartlet, It was a good idea though.
30166,bartlet,So we don't get water from a rock. We just do our thing and take our chances.
30168,bartlet, We're gonna have to do it awfully well this time.
30176,bartlet,Somebody get these guys some pie.
30177,c.j.,"Joey, is there an extra copy of the panel backs? I didn't get one."
30181,c.j.,Hang on! I'm just gonna toss this in my office.
30182,c.j.,Nice job. Take the rest of the night off.
30184,c.j.,"Sam, Sam, sunshine man. Get on the couch, I'm gonna do you right now."
30186,c.j.,"Sorry, I was still talking to Carol."
30188,c.j.,"We really don't know.  Lisa mentioned that it wasn't going that well tonight.  You still got a couple of weeks with her, you'll..."
30190,c.j.,Why? It was a shining moment.
30192,c.j.,Sometimes a little flash is what's required. You said that to me.
30194,c.j.,It wasn't a Vegas act. It was stirring. And I wouldn't hang your head when you say it  got the job done. That job was impossible and it had to be done. There aren't ten guys  in the country who could write that speech.
30211,josh,Why would I put it back?
30213,josh,I thought you were breakfast.
30216,josh,I just went to sleep about two hours ago.
30219,josh,What makes you say that?
30220,josh,I know it’s too big for me. What are you doing here?
30221,josh,You’re flaky. You know that? You’re quite the flake.
30222,josh,I was done with this fight a month ago.
30224,josh,"No, I’m saying it’s 5:00 in the morning."
30225,josh,He always takes photo-ops with you.
30226,josh,"We’re gonna stop with the apples soon, right?"
30228,josh,"No, of course, I’m right. And his relationship with you has everything to do with  politics. He’s a power dater. That’s what power daters do. You know how I know?"
30230,josh,"‘Cause you looked in his eyes, saw his soul, and confronted him in a moment of human  honesty?"
30231,josh,Then he was sure to tell you the truth.
30233,josh,No.  He asked you to marry him?
30234,josh,And you want me to talk you out of it?
30239,josh,We spent six nights with each other.
30241,josh,He just upped and proposed?
30242,josh,"No, Ophelia. It’s called a political asset."
30244,josh,I’ll say more when you call me 30 seconds from your cell phone.
30245,josh,You’ll call me from your cell phone ‘cause that’s where the real conversation always  takes place.
30247,josh,Time number one was on the steps in front of my apartment when you kissed me. It was  snowing. Time number two was when you came over after the State of the Union. Time  number three was at your house when you put on your bootleg tape of the Stones at Wembley  Stadium and put on your feather boa...
30251,josh,Anybody else in the office?
30255,c.j.,"I’m on the plane... No, I’m on the plane... I’ll be coming back tonight. It’s just for  the day... No, it’s just for the day, Dad. We’re coming back tonight... I won’t be  tired... I’ll sleep if I’m tired, but I won’t be tired... ‘Cause we’re coming back at  8:00 and I don’t get tired at 8:00, plus I won’t be the one flying the plane... Oh, my  God. Dad, ‘cause this is how it is. If it’s in the 48 states, we come back the same day.  The taxpayers paid for a very comfortable and fast airplane, and this is what they had in  mind when they did... Am I gonna... No... Because I don’t live in Iowa, and I’m not  allowed to vote there... Ah, see. There’s always a catch... Well, he’s unchallenged in  the Iowa caucus, so I like our chances... No, Dad. I’m on the plane... All right. I’ll  try and call you later if there’s anything interesting to report... Talk to you later."
30256,toby,Anything else?  Okay. Thanks everybody.
30258,toby,Is it possible we’re riding into town in a soy-diesel bus?
30259,c.j.,"There was talk of it, but that idea got kicked off pretty quick."
30261,c.j.,I’m gonna go back there. Have you guys zeroed in on a message for the day?
30262,toby,How to reform the freedom to form act?
30263,c.j., Ritchie’s pulled in to single digits in the overnights.
30265,c.j.,What a gift from heaven it would be if he won.
30267,c.j.,"So, the Four-H Convention?"
30269,c.j.,I don’t get it. How can you not want to see the butter cow?
30271,c.j.,"There’s also a butter Elvis and a butter Last Supper, which has, I swear to God, Toby..."
30273,c.j.,It’s got butter on the table right there between butter James and butter Peter. An almost  mind-blowing vortex of art and material that dares the viewers to recall Marcel Duchamp.
30274,toby,How do they keep it from melting?
30277,c.j.,"Butter, butter, butter, butter, butter, butter, butter."
30279,c.j.,Duchamp is the father of Dadaism.
30282,toby,"It’s like there’s nothing you can do about that joke. It’s coming, and you just have to  stand there."
30283,c.j.,"The cow made of butter? That’s how I like my irony served, my friend."
30284,toby,I have a phone call waiting that’s being relayed through four satellites.
30294,toby,He told you they were tracking UFO in the skies over Maui?
30298,toby,"Listen, Ritchie’s made a statement last night in support of the Pennsylvania Referendum  banning any use of race in college admission. I think the President should say something  in the U.I. Campus."
30304,toby,Write up a few sentences would you? Send it up to the plane right away.
30309,josh,I’m a little tired today.
30313,josh,I’m supposed to see Leo.
30319,josh,"Well, why don’t you wait till we’re a little closer and ask me again?"
30323,josh,What kind of legal authority do you think I’m empowered with?
30325,josh," You get... Yes, thank you."
30329,josh,Then it looks like justice is finally in your hands.
30331,josh,"Yes, well, there’s nothing I can do for you."
30335,josh,What’s going on in Vieques? Protesters?
30341,josh,I don’t-I’m sorry. Why am I...? This is national security.
30345,josh, Arrest them. It’s what he’s waiting for you to do.
30351,josh,"Leo, if I wasn’t working here, I’d probably be with them down there."
30353,josh,This is a crappy thing to do with friendship. These things aren’t supposed to be personal.
30355,bartlet,"You can check a whip count, but I don’t think we get 60 votes in a cloture motion."
30356,bartlet,I think we lose eight Democrats once they find there is a foreign aid budget.   Anything else?
30358,toby,"Uh, well, Ritchie made a statement last night in support of the Referendum in  Pennsylvania. Sam’s gonna work on a few lines in response."
30359,bartlet,"Look, he’s gonna make statements during the primary that force me to move to my left.  It’s not like I get a swing at every pitch, right?"
30360,toby,You know everyone still thinks it’s gonna be Simon.
30361,bartlet,You and I know different.
30362,toby,The overnights have Ritchie inside single digits.
30363,bartlet,"Every candidate’s dream opponent, huh?"
30365,bartlet,I’ll take a look at what Sam does.
30367,bartlet,I’ll take a look at it.
30368,toby,"Thank you, Mr. President."
30371,josh,I’m waiting for a phone call.
30373,josh,"Billy Molina and some people were in a Coast Guard line. They’ve camped out in the live  target range. There’s a carrier that has to fire in the live target range or they can’t  be certified. If they’re not certified, they can’t be deployed, and they have to be  deployed."
30375,josh, Yeah. It’s a strange day when I’m involved with National Security.
30379,josh,Tandy asked Amy to marry him.
30383,josh," That happened fast, don’t you think?"
30389,josh,I just said it was a little fast.
30398,josh,"Billy, it’s Josh. Okay, just tell me a couple things first. Is everybody okay? Is anybody  hurt?"
30401,toby,"“...but a promise for all generations to follow.” Sir, I’ve read it twice, and I don’t  even know where you stand on affirmative action."
30402,bartlet,Yeah. I was trying to avoid a quote.
30403,toby,As well as nouns and pronouns.
30404,bartlet,It’s purposely nonspecific.
30405,toby,I don’t even know what we’re talking about.
30406,bartlet,"We get the word out to our friends, but I was obviously nodding in the direction of  affirmative action."
30407,toby,How about if we oppose affirmative action and get the word out to our friends you were  just kidding?
30408,bartlet,Nobody’s questioning where we stand.
30410,bartlet,I don’t want to campaign today.
30411,toby, What happened to writing a new book?
30412,bartlet,"We will, but we don’t... Man, we don’t have to piss people off everyday in order to  demonstrate that we’re not..."
30414,bartlet,"Look, we’re going to Iowa where we already won. I’m not ignoring the state, and I say  thank you for getting me elected in the first place, and we’re back on the plane. And  I’ll tell you what else. I don’t think it’s a good idea for us to be fighting for news  coverage with three governors, two senators, and the head of the church of I Hate You.  Let’s just get in under the radar."
30419,toby,"Thank you, Mr. President."
30421,c.j.,They say something in the primary that force us to the left so that we have to...
30426,toby,He’s going to a college campus. It’s a pretty good time to talk about affirmative action  when it comes to admissions.
30429,c.j.,"Your father didn’t need affirmative action and neither did mine, and they were both  children of immigrants."
30430,toby,Your father needed the G.I. bill and so did mine.
30431,c.j., I’m the wrong Democrat to talk to about this.
30433,c.j.,"‘Cause...  After my father fought in Korea, he became what this government begs  every college graduate to become. He became a teacher, and he raised a family on a  teachers salary. And he paid his taxes, and always crossed at the green. And anytime  there was an opportunity for career advancement, it took an extra five years because  invariably there is a less-qualified black woman in the picture, so instead of retiring  as superintendent of the Ohio Valley Union Free School District, he retired head of the  math department at William Henry Harrison Junior High."
30443,josh,Then you get on the phone with him.
30444,josh,This isn’t a hostage situation. It’s a legitimate protest.
30445,josh,"You’re free. Excuse me, sir. You’re free to arrest them or shoot them, but we won’t  because it’s bad politics. Let’s just remember what the thing is here."
30446,josh,"Puerto Rico lived under Spain for four centuries, under the U.S. for one. In 500 years,  it hasn’t determined its own destiny for five minutes. They’re using depleted uranium  shells--"
30447,josh,"--napalm, cluster bombs. Vieques has a cancer rate 25% higher than the rest of Puerto  Rico. When is the time to be protesting? Tell me. I’ll tell them. They’ll do it."
30450,josh,I heard you overthrow the government.
30452,josh,Is there someone who can take care of Henry?
30453,josh,Nothing. I... love Henry. Is there someone that takes care of him when you go away?
30454,josh,What do you think about going away for a few days?
30455,josh,Tahiti... or Paris. Venice. We can go to Epcot if you want.
30456,josh,"Lie on the beach, dance at night, reggae, a little UB-40..."
30457,josh,They don’t have reggae in Tahiti?
30462,josh,I’m buying plane tickets right now. I’m making reservations.
30464,josh,"I’m saying when I walk out that door, I’m buying plane tickets."
30507,josh,"We were able to make a deal with Billy. They’ll pull off the island right away. In  exchange, we meet with a delegation, political affairs, Navy..."
30509,josh,"We’ll be slapped by the right, but they’re not gonna want to piss off the Latinos."
30511,josh,You know what else? I’m going to Tahiti with Amy.
30513,josh,"Day after tomorrow.  So this, this guy..."
30515,josh,I-I gotta go online and buy Tahitian things.
30528,c.j.,He was what he was supposed to be.
30529,toby,He was Uncle Fluffy. It’s Dr. Jekyll and Uncle Fluffy all over again.
30530,c.j.,"He said he wasn’t gonna respond to Ritchie, and I totally agree that it’s too early."
30531,toby,He was asked the question. He was asked the question.
30532,toby, No word on the Republicans?
30533,c.j.,"Oh, that’d be too much to hope for."
30534,toby,"There’s an old expression: “Quando dio, ole castigarci ci manda, quello che desideriamo.”  When the gods wish to punish us, they answer our prayers.  Anyway, he’s doing it  again."
30539,josh,This is great. Good is gonna come from this.
30541,josh,"Maybe. Yeah, but how often do you get to..."
30553,josh,There’s a woman I’ve been...
30559,josh,We were supposed to... This is ridiculous. We were supposed to go away.
30561,josh,It doesn’t matter. We just... We’ve been having trouble getting together on...  Day after tomorrow?
30565,josh,I need to be here for this.
30569,josh,Yeah. Okay. I-I’m glad it’s taken care of. I’m glad we got the meeting.
30574,josh,"It’s jury duty. It’s not appendectomy. It’s jury duty. Do it, don’t do it, but if you  don’t do it, you don’t get to complain about the O.J. verdict."
30577,josh,I can’t go day after tomorrow.
30578,josh,"I mean I can go another time, but I can’t go day after tomorrow."
30579,josh,"It was pretty sudden for anybody, Amy."
30580,josh,"There was a problem in Vieques today, and we came to a good resolution, and it involves  a meeting day after tomorrow."
30581,josh,Yeah. No. He’s not. I want to stay.
30582,josh,"For one thing, it involves a friend of mine, and he did something he didn’t want to do,  and... Look, I just want to make sure his back is covered."
30584,josh,"I do, and when you’re done comparison-shopping, give me a call."
30588,toby,"You know, after slavery and voting rights, if the occasional Caucasian loses a  promotion..."
30589,c.j.,I think we’re gonna have to agree to disagree.
30590,toby,I don’t like doing that. 
30592,c.j.,You phoned ahead for research?
30593,toby,Sure. This is Washington on the need for a national university.
30597,c.j.,"He said, “We banished discrimination from our laws. Now let’s banish discrimination from  our minds and hearts.”"
30599,c.j.,"The President in Iowa. He said, “Let’s banish discrimination from our minds and hearts.”  How is affirmative action doing that?"
30600,toby,I’m talking about college admissions.
30601,c.j.,I’m talking about my father.
30603,c.j.,‘Cause he’s not doing fine. He forgets things.  He forgets things.
30604,toby, He’s not a young guy anymore.
30605,c.j.,I’m not talking about dates and phone numbers.
30607,c.j.,"He forgets what’s going on. He thought this was the general election today, and...  he snaps back in, but...  And he’s gotta watch me bopping around  on Air Force One."
30609,c.j.,"Sam, have you ever seen the butter cow at the Four-H Convention?"
30619,toby,"I wouldn’t ask a lot of questions, Sam."
30625,josh,Thanks for coming.  Something’s wrong with the lights. Let me feel  around for a switch here.
30626,josh,"A little piece of Tahiti right here in Georgetown. Would you like a Samoan Fog Cutter  or a Navy Grog? A Samoan Fog Cutter has three kinds of rum, including Bacardi 451 and...   the difference between that and a Navy Grog is..."
30629,josh,I don’t want to turn on the news.
30631,bartlet,I thought you’d gone home.
30632,toby,I was just watching some of the coverage.
30635,bartlet,I mean it’s gonna be Ritchie.
30637,bartlet,"It would have been, I don’t know, it would have seemed obnoxious. It would’ve seemed  like grandstanding.  You want some bourbon?"
30640,toby,"I was a telemarketer for about a week. I can’t remember what we were selling, but you  worked off a script. “Hi. Good evening. My name is...” And “Toby Ziegler” was okay for  New York, but once I got into the other time zones, I needed a name. I wasn’t gonna  bother anybody."
30641,bartlet,"Toby, if you have something to say, please say it."
30642,toby,Ritchie’s good for all time zones.
30643,bartlet, My family signed the Declaration of Independence. You think I’ve got an ethnicity  problem?
30644,toby,"Well, the line isn’t between light skin and dark skin."
30646,toby, It’s between educated and masculine... or Eastern Academic Elite and Plain-Spoken.
30647,bartlet,It’s always been like that.
30648,toby,"Yeah, but a funny thing happened when the White House got demystified. The impression  was left that anybody could do it."
30649,bartlet,You’re not telling me anything I don’t know.
30650,toby,"It’s one thing that Ritchie came out for the Pennsylvania Referendum today, but the  manner in which he articulated it. His presence, the clear sign he wasn’t personally  engaged with the facts."
30652,toby,"His staff was cringing, I promise you, and we let it go."
30653,bartlet,It wasn’t the moment to go.
30654,toby,You were asked the question.
30655,bartlet, Do you have anything else?
30656,toby," Sir, I don’t think I need to tell you that the level of respect with which the  staff speaks of you doesn’t change, depending on whether or not you’re in the room."
30658,toby,"Well, there’s always been a concern... about the two Bartlets.  The absent-minded  professor with the “Aw, Dad” sense of humor. Disarming and unthreatening. Good for all  time zones. And the Nobel Laureate. Still searching for salvation. Lonely, frustrated.  Lethal."
30659,bartlet,You’re gonna sing a country western song?
30660,toby,The one whose father never liked him because he was too smart.
30661,bartlet, This stopped being fun for me a little while ago.
30663,bartlet,It was actually never fun for me. I was just being polite.
30664,toby," Your father used to hit you, didn’t he, Mr. President?"
30666,toby,"Your father used to hit you, sir?"
30671,bartlet,I’m done being polite now.
30672,toby,"He did it because you made him mad, but you didn’t know why."
30673,bartlet,"Toby, it was a complicated relationship. Can I help you?"
30674,toby,It was because you were smarter than he was.
30675,bartlet,It was a complicated relationship.
30676,toby,"He didn’t like you, sir. That’s why he hit you. That’s why people hit each other.  He didn’t like you. You were smarter than he was."
30677,bartlet,Why are we talking about this?
30678,toby,"So maybe if you get enough votes, win one more election, maybe your father will--"
30679,bartlet,"You have stepped WAY over the line, and any other President would have your ass on the  sidewalk right now."
30681,bartlet,"They would’ve had you on the sidewalk a long time ago.  I don’t know what the  hell goes on in a Brooklyn shrink’s office, but get it the hell out of my house!"
30682,toby,"Thank you, Mr. President."
30684,josh,Your flight was all right?
30687,josh, These are your things?
30688,josh, I'm going to put them back in my office.
30689,josh,No. I'll be right back.
30690,josh,They'll be all right back there.
30691,josh,You ever seen the White House?
30693,josh, This is the communications bullpen where Toby Ziegler and Sam Seaborn  work. The rest of the ommunications and speech-writing work across the alley in the Old  Executive Office Building.
30694,josh,And here comes the actual Sam Seaborn. What's going on?
30703,josh," Uh... that's Leo's office. It has  a private entrance into the Oval Office, but we'll go in here."
30705,josh,"Yeah, he wanted to know if you had talked to anybody on the way here."
30706,josh, This is the Oval Office.
30707,josh,"That's the Resolute Desk. It was built from the timbers of the H.M.S. Resolute and given to  Rutherford Hayes by Queen Victoria to thank the U.S. for finding the abandoned ship.   We're going to go over to the residence, but I'm going to take you out through the portico."
30710,josh,You don't think this is interesting?
30711,josh,"If somebody sees us, I'd like for them to see me giving you a tour."
30712,josh,"It was designed by an Irish architect named James Hoban, who won the job in an open  competition. It was built largely by slaves. They just found the pay receipts a few  weeks ago."
30713,josh,Their owners.  Right through here.
30714,josh,Yeah.  We're gonna go in here now. This is the President's private study.
30721,josh,Leo likes to show people the soot stains on the North Portico.
30728,bartlet, The speech is going out?
30733,bartlet,I've been having trouble sleeping.
30734,bartlet,"You understand that this is an election here, right? I mean by itself who cares?  The President's having trouble sleeping, he talks to a doctor, but with the MS and the  hearings and you're a psychiatrist..."
30737,bartlet,"Yeah, we know you. You helped Josh out last year?"
30747,bartlet,Not 'til the next morning in the middle of a national security briefing.
30748,bartlet," Stanley, I think you're under-selling yourself when you say you're not an  expert in sleep disoders. 'Cause you've been right straight on the money so far. "
30751,bartlet," You think if I put this out, I'm gonna fall asleep?"
30756,bartlet,"I'm sorry. Before we get to lifestyle factors, I'm just gonna turn this on. "
30757,bartlet,When we're done writing it.
30760,c.j.,I imagine we'll be getting their reviews any minute.
30761,c.j.,Key members of House and Senate Foreign Relations.
30762,c.j.,You see it Sunday night. That's it everybody. That's a full lid. Have a good weekend.
30763,c.j.,"Hey, what are you doing here?"
30765,c.j.,Isn't Billy in the Congo?
30767,c.j.,Does he miss deadlines?
30769,c.j.,What about the other end?
30770,c.j.,What do you think has happened?
30771,c.j.,Without written permission from the Ministry?
30772,c.j.,By reading State background notes.
30775,c.j.,"Well, I'm going to go talk to Leo."
30776,c.j.,"I don't care that he's been... Look, I'm going to get into this, but if he's missed two  deadlines, then his fifteen minutes was yesterday."
30783,toby, This is the fifth time you're reading it. Are there words in there you  don't understand?
30784,toby,"Of course there wouldn't be, 'cause you can't rise to a position like yours without.. "
30785,toby,"Look, this is exactly what we said we wanted it to be. We said we were tired of reading  about the President's scattershot foreign policy. We said - you want to fillet me for this,  fine - we said when we go to the U.N., we were gonna..."
30787,toby,We said we were gonna... Yeah?
30791,toby,Why do you call her my wife?
30797,toby,"Yeah. I... When he got back, for a minute."
30807,toby,What has he said about the speech?
30809,toby,We haven't talked in a little while.
30813,toby,"Sure, 'cause it's the sixth time."
30819,c.j.,Someone's going to get an ass-kicking from the missus.
30822,c.j.,Yeah... something else has come up though.
30824,c.j.,"Leonard Wallace just came to see me. Billy Price is on assignment in the Congo, and he  missed two deadlines. he hasn't gotten anywhere with State. The embassy in Kinshasa  confirmed that a Belgian tv crew shooting outside Goma saw an American captured by MaiMai  rebels."
30828,c.j.,Reporting a story no one is paying attention to.
30834,toby,He liked it alot. Mostly what I wrote. Not so much what you wrote. 
30836,toby,"Her office called already, didn't they?"
30838,toby,"You probably want to rethink calling me ""baby,"" right?"
30856,bartlet,Planes aren't allowed to fly over the White House.
30899,toby,I need these distributed.
30901,toby, You let her in my office?
30903,toby,What the hell did you let her in my office for?
30906,toby," We consulted plenty of people. What do you think, Sam and I create  foreign policy around here?"
30907,toby,We brought in... For three weeks...
30909,toby,The Secretary of State. Since when did you get to come in here?
30910,toby,"This is a Presidential address, Andrea, not a camel."
30911,toby,A camel. A horse built by committee.
30918,c.j.,Billy's wife is already here. She's in my office right now.
30926,c.j.,"The MaiMais care about proper documentation, do they?"
30927,c.j.,"If his paper were in order, he wouldn't have been abducted at gunpoint?"
30928,c.j.,"I'm C.J. Cregg. I'm the White House Press Secretary. That guy sat in my room for a year,  his wife's sitting in my office, his two kids are sitting at home, and I want him back."
30929,c.j.,"This is a shakedown, so tell us how much money, and where does it go."
30930,c.j.,The Congolese government is a myth.
30936,josh,"There's an editorial on sugar subsidies in the International Herald-Tribune. Make sure  Leo's got a copy. Also, make sure you send me home with a Congressional facebook."
30938,josh,I'm still mixing up Cooper and Hooper.
30940,josh,'Cause Cooper sounds a lot like Hooper. What does it matter? Just...
30956,josh,For an internet start-up.
30960,josh,"Sounds like the hype's alive and well, too."
30964,josh, You can't be thinking about taking a job that may not be  around a year from now?
30968,josh,"Well, all I can offfer you is a title bump."
30970,josh,Senior Assistance to the Deputy Chief of Staff for Strategic Planning.
30972,josh,"Then I can't offer you a title bump. The sugar subsidy editorial and the facebook, okay?  Cooper and Hooper."
30990,toby,"Well, we'd like to talk to them about it."
30992,toby,Neither foes the speech. It calls fanaticism fanaticism.
30993,toby,"It's fanaticism whether we call it that or not, so were going to call it that. We respect  all religions, all cultures."
30994,toby,"Yes, to a point. Grotesque oppression isn't okay just because it's been institutionlised.  If you ask me, I think we should have gotten into the game three, four decades ago, but  they're coming after us now, so it's time to saddle up."
30995,toby,We do know what's right.
30996,toby,There's a lot of reasons why they hate us. You know when they're gonna like us? When we win.
30998,c.j.,"Janet, we're working some back channels right now. I think if you can make yourself  comfortable here, we might some news in an hour or so."
30999,c.j.,"No, we can't buy them off directly, but what we do is, we offer to withhold money from  their enemies."
31000,c.j.,Your husband is employed by a billion dollar corporation.
31001,c.j.,"Let's not get that far right now. Listen, your clothes are wet. Can I get you some..."
31005,bartlet,"Well, Congress was investigating me."
31006,bartlet,And I was censured. Then I had to give the State of the Union.
31007,bartlet,I'm running for reelection.
31008,bartlet,"Things are blowing up everywhere, and I have chosen the General Assembly of the U.N.  to define a tougher foreign policy. Not unusually stressful, no."
31009,bartlet,"I don't like the word ""stress"". It's a Madison Avenue word. It's something that can be  cured with flavored coffee and bath bubbles."
31010,bartlet,"I have a job I like, and my family's healthy. "
31011,bartlet,Stress is for other people.
31012,bartlet,"I'm saying it's not stress. I was feeling stressed five nights ago, too and I slept fine."
31015,bartlet,"So, what do you charge?"
31016,bartlet,"For three hundred and seventy-five dollars an hour, you ought to bring your own damn  lingerie."
31017,bartlet,"There's a great story about Arthur Miller. ""Death of a Salesman"" had just opened on  Broadway the night before, and he was walking around his old neighborhood in Brooklyn  and he see's a hot dog vendor that he went to high school with, and he says, ""Hey, Jimmy,  it's me, Arthur Miller."" And the hot dog vendor says, ""Artie, how you doing? What you  been up to?"" And Miller says, ""I'm, you know, I'm a playwright."" And the hot dog vendor  says, ""Hmm, play writing, I should've gone into that."" Three hundred and seventy-five  dollars an hour."
31019,bartlet,I can't sleep. I can't sleep. I'll be tired and I'll lie there and it doesn't happen.
31022,bartlet,Say what you'd say to anyother patient.
31023,bartlet, I had a conversation with one of m aides that night after we got back from  Iowa. He called me on something.
31024,bartlet,"Well, I guess we talked about a lot of things. Who we think the Republican challenger is  gonna be be, and imcumbency and campaign stategy, strategic overview, but the long and  short of it is, my father never liked me at all. "
31025,bartlet,"Yeah, I'd thought you'd enjoy that."
31067,toby,"It took... Andrea, it took three days to get the language through NSC and the NSA."
31068,toby,It isn't coming out of the speech.
31069,toby,Then why were we here for an hour?
31071,toby," ""Our goal is neither to preach nor proclaim American values. We have deep  respect for our Islamic brothers and sisters and we have a great deal to learn from  the values of... tolerence and faith that are deeply held throughout the Islamic world.""  So this is your way of saying any resemblance the previous paragraph may have had to  foreign policy is purely coincidental?"
31073,toby,Our goal is to proclaim American values.
31074,toby,"I think the President will decide what the speech is suppose to be about, but the  reality is, the United States of America no longer sucks up to reactionaries, and  our staunch allies will know what we mean."
31075,toby,"Nobody's blowing off the coalition, and that coalition will be plenty strong."
31077,toby,"That freedom and democracy are coming soon to a theatre near them, so get dressed."
31080,toby,"Well... How about when we, instead of blowing Iraq back to the seventh century for  harbouring terrorists and trying to develop nuclear weapons, we just imposed economic  sanctions and were reviled by the Arab world for not giving them a global charge card  and a free trade treaty? How about when we pushed Israel to give up land for peace?"
31081,toby,"How about when we sent American soldiers to protect Saudi Arabia, and the Arab world  told us we were desecrating their holy land? We'll ignore the fact that we were invited.  How about two weeks ago, in the State of the Union when the President praised the Islamic  people as faithful and hardworking only to be denounced in the Arab press as knowing  nothing about Islam? But none of that is the point."
31082,toby,"I don't remember having to explain to Italians that our problem wasn't with them, but  with Mussolini! Why does the U.S. have to take every Arab country out for an ice cream  cone? They'll like us when we win!"
31083,toby,"Thousands of madrassahs teaching children nothing, nothing, nothing but the Koran and to  hate America. Who do we see about that?  I'll like us when we win."
31084,toby,Let me take another look at the softer language.
31086,c.j.,"It's not money, actually, it's a promise to honor international sanctions against the  export of something called ""Col-Tan"" by the Rwandan Army."
31088,c.j.,"It's a mineral they have a lot of in Congo. When you refine it, it's a necessary component  of cell phones and pagers, and the Rwandans and Ugandans smuggle it illegally."
31090,josh,"Akin Wamba, who's the Maimai rebel commander, sent word through a crew that was filming  in Goma."
31092,josh,Yeah. He was killed in an ambush. Embassy Kinshasa's going to get the body.
31094,bartlet,What's wrong with my head?
31095,bartlet,Of course not. That would be three hundred and eighty-five dollars an hour.
31096,bartlet,It's not good for a person to keep setting goals?
31097,bartlet,"Well, I'm told that most men lead lives of quiet desperation."
31100,bartlet,I think you're talking about the Lincoln Bedroom.
31103,bartlet,I think I've made tough choices.
31104,bartlet,You don't know anything.
31105,bartlet,I'm not trying to get my father to like me.
31107,bartlet,"Stanley, I hate to put it this way, but I'm me, and you're you, and we're done when I  say we're done."
31110,bartlet,"We spoke several times about Kashmir, and she assured me they're working towards a peaceful  resolution. We also had a spirited conversation about chess. "
31111,bartlet,"Chess was invented in India. Somewhere around 600 A.D., a gigantic chessboard was constructed  at Fatehpur Sikri which was the capital a long time ago, and human figures were used as chess  pieces. "
31114,c.j.,The history of chess by Dr. Josiah Bartlet. 
31121,bartlet," In sandlewood, and a laquered classic Stanton in boxwood. "
31122,c.j.," Thank you, everybody. "
31123,bartlet, Hartsfield votes  in three hours and 21 minutes! We're gonna find out who the next President is. 
31124,bartlet,"I'm gonna give some of the chess sets out as gifts, did you see them? "
31125,c.j.,Leo needs you in the car. 
31133,bartlet,What's China's reaction? 
31139,bartlet,"No. I mean, we could try, but they're not gonna go for it. "
31141,bartlet,What are they asking for? 
31145,bartlet,I'm assuming Nancy and Fitzwallace and the Chiefs...
31149,bartlet,We have a pretty good sense of the worst-case scenario? 
31153,bartlet,"All right, we know the play. "
31155,bartlet,She gave me these beautiful chess sets. 
31157,bartlet,Yeah. I'm on my way. Let Fitzwallace know I'm gonna order the Seventh Fleet into the Taiwan Strait. 
31161,bartlet,"Listen, they start voting in Hartsfield's landing in about two and a half hours, so this may  end up being somebody else's problem.  The scale of the war  games is unprecedented? "
31172,bartlet,After our next move comes their next move. 
31174,c.j.,"No, and it's important to remember that Patriot missles are defensive equipment which can only  be used in the event of an attack. "
31175,c.j.,I'm not in a position to say what's provoking the war games. Chris? 
31176,c.j.,"Actually, under the '79 Act we agreed to provide Taiwan with sufficient capability to defend  itself, but we're getting way ahead of ourselves. There's gonna be a Pentagon briefing at 10 AM. "
31177,c.j.,The President will be monitoring the situation in the China Seas as well as Hartsfield's  Landing. Any of the new people not know about Hartsfield's Landing? 
31178,c.j.,"Hartsfield's Landing is a town in New Hampshire, population 63. While the rest of New Hampshire  goes to the polls at 8 AM tomorrow, all of the 42 registered voters of Hartsfield vote at one  minute past midnight or...   It's all part of the service here at Claudia's house of useless knowledge. That's a full lid,  thank you very much. "
31179,c.j.,"Ironically, neither of them had ever been to a major league baseball game when they wrote  that song. The other song they were famous for was? "
31180,c.j.,"""Shine on Harvest Moon"". "
31181,c.j.,Charlie.  What are those? 
31182,c.j.,I need a copy of the President's private schedule. 
31185,c.j., What the hell is this? 
31186,c.j.,I've got to sign it out? 
31187,c.j.,I'm the Press Secretary. 
31188,c.j.,Gimme the damn schedule 
31189,c.j., The anal-retentive side of you is not gonna to help you get girls. 
31195,josh,You were taking your time. 
31197,josh,"Do you remember Jennifer Flender, the daughter of the mom and pop who have the tackle shop? "
31201,josh,The daughter just e-mailed me and told me her parents are voting for Ritchie. 
31205,josh,'Cause she's got a little crush on me. 
31207,josh,She's twenty years old. 
31209,josh,He lives in New Hampshire. 
31211,josh,"It doesn't matter. Mom and pop are voting for Ritchie, and they vote in Hartsfield's Landing.  You gotta talk to them. "
31213,josh,I'm not kidding. Two votes could be the margin. 
31219,josh,That are cast at 12:01 and counted at 12:07. The rest of New Hampshire doesn't come in until  nine PM. That's 21 hours of the news having nothing to report but the winner at Hartsfield's  Landing. I want it to be us. You have to get on the phone and talk to the Flenders. 
31221,josh,"They liked you. They took you in, they fed you. "
31223,josh,"You were pretty pathetic, and the Fenders fed you. "
31225,josh,"See, you remember their name. There's obviously a connection. "
31227,josh, Politics in New Hampshire is what? 
31229,josh,"Thank you. Get on the phone, find out what their problem with the President is, and solve it. "
31233,josh,Sad but true. You know what I'm thinking? 
31235,josh,"Cell phone, Lafayette Park, and a warm coat. "
31242,bartlet,Thank you. How are you? 
31246,bartlet,"The Prime Minister gave me a few different sets, and I wanted to give them as gifts. "
31248,bartlet,The State of the Union was really something else. 
31250,bartlet,"This one's a Lotus set, hand-carved camel-bone. She told me it came to her from a direct  descendent of Tan Sen. You know who that was? "
31252,bartlet,The greatest musician of his time. 
31254,bartlet,"Sixteenth century. He'd go to the human chess matches at the Mogul Court of Emperor Akbar,  and that began the family obsession with the game. Wanna play? "
31260,bartlet,"No, I'm none of those things. I'm just grand. "
31261,bartlet," You're white, but don't ever touch me. "
31264,bartlet,"Ah, the Fibonacci opening. Very interesting. "
31270,bartlet,A billion dollars at the Export-Import Bank didn't hurt. 
31272,bartlet,"Three billion in direct foreign investment to the forty-four billion China gets. You're an  American, where would you rather put your money? "
31278,bartlet,"It's bad. If Kashmir's the most dangerous place on earth, the second most dangerous is the  Taiwan Strait. Taiwan's got four hundred thousand troops on high alert; the size of China's  war games is unprecedented. "
31284,bartlet,That's right. Plus guess what?  The Patriot tests aren't why China's  showing its teeth. 
31286,bartlet,Are you ready to come inside? 
31288,bartlet,"By the end of the week, Taiwan's going to announce they are holding their first free elections. "
31299,josh,"It's been five years, and why is it our fault? "
31301,josh,It's called free trade. 
31303,josh, Didn't you... talk up our accomplishments? 
31309,josh,"No! You- We're not making a trade commitment to the Flenders! We're not for protectionism,  and neither are the Republicans. Tell them the President's been good for the ecomony overall. "
31311,josh,We're for affordable health care. 
31313,josh,They don't - the Flenders don't work at the pulp mill! 
31315,josh,"All right. If Canada's making cheaper pulp, then New Hampshire has to diversify. That's why  the President has allocated five hundred million dollars for trade adjustment assistance.  That's why - write this down. That's why he's tripled small business start-up loans. That's  why he's balancing the budget.  Go. "
31325,c.j.,Yet you don't have it. 
31328,c.j.,I just hope you didn't leave the building with it. 
31329,c.j.," Think you're going to want to talk nicer to me than that, because when a reporter  finds it, they're going to come to me, and that thing is stamped D12, and you signed out D12,  and rules are rules. "
31337,bartlet,"Yeah.  Give us a minute, would you? "
31340,toby,"Good evening Mr. President, welcome back. "
31342,toby, I think this note was delivered to me by mistake. 
31346,toby,"It says 'Sigmund, come play chess'."
31347,bartlet,"That was a joke. Not so funny, huh? "
31348,toby,That's a beautiful chess set. 
31351,bartlet,"Yeah. It's hand-carved, it belonged to the Prime Minister's grandfather. He used it to play  with Lord Mounbatten. "
31352,toby,I’m surprised she gave it away.
31353,bartlet,"Nah, she didn't, we just boosted it from the palace on our way out. I’ve got some little  bottles of shampoo and conditioner, too. "
31354,toby," Well, it's a beautiful gift, sir. "
31356,toby,I wouldn't want to take your time tonight. 
31357,bartlet," Come on, now. You were out of line, I was a jackass - let's call a truce. "
31358,toby,"Well, I certainly apologise, sir. "
31360,toby,Aren't you in the middle of a game with Sam? 
31361,bartlet,"Yeah; he's... one, two, four, eight, twelve moves away from checkmate. "
31364,toby, Lord Mountbatten used to play with this set? 
31365,bartlet,With Jawaharlal Nehru when they came to an agreement on the necessity of India's independence. 
31366,toby,Appropriate topic for the evening. 
31368,bartlet,"Taiwan's not gonna be our topic. Ah, the Evans Gambit! "
31369,toby,There's no such thing as the Evans Gambit. 
31370,bartlet,"A variation of the Giuoco Piano opening, named after a British sea captain, W.D. Evans, who  invented it in 1820 - don't tell me chess moves. "
31372,bartlet,"Well, it's as popular today as it was back then. "
31376,bartlet,Re-election and the Bartlet Psychosis. 
31377,toby," Seems to me the last time we were here, we didn't do very well. "
31378,bartlet,So we get right back on the horse. 
31379,toby,"I was out of line sir, I really do apologize. "
31380,bartlet,"You apologized already, so let's get back on the horse. "
31381,toby,Neither one of us rides horses. 
31382,bartlet,That makes it more likely we'll learn something. 
31384,bartlet,Excuse me; eleven moves. 
31385,bartlet,Take your time.  Think happy thoughts... 
31388,bartlet,The Spanish brought chess to the court of Charlemagne in 760 AD. Charlemagne is French for Charles  the Great. The Charles is a river in Boston. The Hudson River is actually not a river at all... 
31390,bartlet,Now take your time.  See the whole board. 
31392,bartlet,"It is in the Catskills, but once it gets to Manhattan, it’s a tidal estuary. "
31396,bartlet,"Well, how do you think it went? "
31398,bartlet,"That’s right, except they didn’t call them Patriots. What did they call them? "
31418,josh,"I’m going out for some pizza, do you want any? "
31419,c.j., I’ll go get it. I want to get some air. 
31421,c.j.,45 minutes till Hartsfield’s Landing! 
31422,josh,We’re working the room. 
31424,josh,It is absurd that 42 people have this kind of power. 
31427,c.j., I think it’s democracy at its purest. They all gather at once... 
31429,c.j.,"It’s not a gas station, it’s nice.  There’s a registrar or voters, the names  are called in the alphabetical order, they put a folded piece of paper into a box. See, this  is the difference between you and me. "
31431,c.j.,"Those 42 people are teaching us something about ourselves: that freedom is the glory of God,  that democracy is its birthright, and that our vote matters. "
31432,josh,You’re getting the pizza? 
31433,c.j.,"Yeah, I should call ahead. "
31434,c.j.,He crazy-glued my phone. 
31436,c.j.,Ha ha. Charlie! Charlie crazy-glued my phone. Okay. Okay...  
31442,josh,Is this gonna end up with Mackey Flender as Fed chair? 
31444,josh,Tell them a national sales tax is regressive. Poor people pay a much higher percentage of  their income.  Tell them we’ll study it. 
31448,josh, There’s no salmon in New Hampshire! 
31450,josh,Tell them we haven’t made a decision on the salmon runs. Tell them salmon restoration is  important to the economy. 
31452,josh,What am I – the fish guy? Tell them we’re looking into it. 
31454,josh,He’s not going to... That’s the other guys! He’s not going privatize Social Security! He’ll...  He’ll privatize New Hampshire before he privatizes Social Security! 
31456,josh,‘Cause we told Congress we’d keep an open mind! 
31458,josh," Here. “Bartlet for New Hampshire.” Gives all the reasons why  Bartlet’s for the people of New Hampshire, the Flenders, everybody, all... 17 of them or...  whatever the hell goes on out there. Why are you wearing my coat? "
31463,josh,Trying to get a little pizza in an uncivilized world. 
31465,josh,"No. Listen, so I shouldn’t sweat, right? There’s a predetermined time for the carrier groups? "
31467,josh,Half of you always wants to let them go. Half of everybody always wants to let them go. 
31469,josh,"You’re gonna turn the carrier groups around, right? "
31472,josh," Yeah, it’s me. I just want to remind you that child support collection is up 37%. "
31474,josh,I said child support collection is up 37%. We’re cracking up on deadbeat dads. I wanted to  make sure you told them that. 
31478,josh,"He’s talking about Tawian, he’s saying 400,000 troops and a battery of Patriot missiles just  to think about holding free elections. You know, it was one of those things... "
31481,bartlet,"Let me tell you, you’re really showing me something tonight. A lot of spunk, a lot of pluck,  this game isn’t all about size, you know. There’s a little thing called heart, and you’ve  got it, my friend. "
31482,toby,"You know what, old man? The very minute they swear in the next guy, you and I are going round  and round. "
31484,toby, How did you get good? 
31485,bartlet,"I had a friend in school who taught me. He was good. He was ranked 18 and under. He was a  really nice guy, everybody liked him. "
31487,bartlet,David Wheaton. Everybody had a crush on his sister. 
31489,bartlet,"He went on to Princeton and Christmas vacation, he’d saved up to go to San Francisco and he was  on the wharf and he saw a guy beating a woman up and he went in to stop it and the guy stabbed  him to death. "
31490,toby,"Well, he taught you well. "
31491,bartlet,"So you know, I had this historic stretch of sleeplessness after our last meeting? "
31493,bartlet,Got so bad Leo brought in a guy from ATVA who worked with Josh. 
31494,toby,Isn’t he a trauma specialist? 
31495,bartlet,"Yeah, but we know him, and I figured he had to go to school for everything, so... Anyway, we  brought him in late at night. "
31497,bartlet,He said it was your fault. He said you shouldn’t bother me so much. 
31498,toby,I really am sorry about that. 
31500,toby,Yeah. I forgot for a second that you’re hilarious. 
31501,bartlet,Let’s go ahead and say the Republicans nominate Ritchie. 
31503,bartlet,"First of all, I’d stop for a moment and say, you know, ‘why?’ I mean they got some serious guys  in the field. Kalmbach, Daniel, Wesley? "
31504,toby,"Democrats had a lot serious guys in the field, and they nominated you. "
31507,bartlet, You think the strike against me is nobody likes the smartest kid in the class. 
31508,toby,"I don’t know, sir. Being a smartest kid in the class is a pretty good pitch, it’s not a strike  unless you watch it as it sails by. "
31512,toby,I don’t believe you are. 
31513,bartlet,"If a guy is a good neighbor, if he puts in a day, if every once in a while he laughs, if every  once in a while he thinks about somebody else and, above all else, if he can find his way to  compassion and, and tolerance, then he’s my brother, I don’t give a damn if he didn’t get past  finger-painting. What I can’t stomach are people who’re out to convince people that the educated  are soft and privileged and out to make them feel like they’re less, then, you know, ‘he may be  educated, but I’m plain-spoken, just like you!’ Especially when we know that education can be a  silver bullet, it can be the silver bullet, Toby! For crime, poverty, unemployment, drugs, hate... "
31514,toby,Who are you trying to convince? 
31515,bartlet,I’m saying I don’t watch the pitch go by. 
31517,bartlet,"And if I do, it’s not because my father... "
31519,bartlet," Can we talk... God, can we talk about, please, can we talk about my father with some respect?  The man’s gone, can we... he’s my father, he wasn’t a Dickens character! "
31526,bartlet,Don’t cheat. I know exactly where the pieces on the board are. I know exactly where the pieces  are on Sam’s board. I know exactly where the pieces still are on David Wheaton’s.  
31527,bartlet,All right.  You can bring the ambassador back now and get Beijing. 
31530,bartlet,"I don’t know, but for sure we’re gonna blame you. "
31532,bartlet,I don’t know. Toby keeps coming back at me with this... I don’t know. He says I let the pitch go by. 
31534,bartlet,"I soften... I smooth myself out publicly. It’s not a put-on, by the way, I’m honestly folksy. "
31542,bartlet,"Yeah, well, he keeps coming back at me. "
31546,bartlet,Just playing some chess.  
31548,c.j.,It must be bent or something. 
31549,c.j.,"I’m staying right here, I haven’t moved! "
31551,c.j.,"Yes! Okay, well, obviously I’m not. "
31555,c.j.,Charlie’s getting me back for...
31566,josh,I came out here to tell you to let them vote. 
31567,josh," Yeah, this is Josh Lyman. We just wanted to call and thank you again for all your  work and remind you that the polls in Hartsfield’s Landing open in fourteen minutes. Get the  chains in the truck, Mack? Okay, listen, tell your sister in Oregon I’m gonna try and learn  something about salmon. Right now, all I know is they’re good on a bagel. Good night. "
31568,josh," Maybe they are morally superior. Anyway, they get to vote. "
31569,josh,It’s freezing out here. Can I have my coat back? 
31570,toby,"Abbey told me this story once. She said you were at a party once where you were bending the  guy’s ear. You were telling him that Ellie had mastered her multiplication tables and she  was in third grade reading at a fifth-grade level and she loved books and she scored two  goals for her soccer team the week before, you were going on and on... And what made that  story remarkable was that the party you were at was in Stockholm and the man you were talking  you was King Gustav, who two hours earlier had given you the Nobel Prize in economics.   I mean, my god, you just won the Nobel Prize and all you wanted to talk about  to the King of Sweden was Ellie’s multiplication tables! "
31572,toby,"You’re a good father, you don’t have to act like it. You’re the President, you don’t have  to act like it. You’re a good man, you don’t have to act like it. You’re not just folks,  you’re not plain-spoken... Do not – do not – do not act like it! "
31573,bartlet,I don’t want to be killed. 
31574,toby,"Then make this election about smart, and not... Make it about engaged, and not. Qualified,  and not. Make it about a heavyweight. You’re a heavyweight. And you’ve been holding me up  for too many rounds. "
31575,bartlet,Pick your king up. We’re not done playing yet. 
31577,c.j.,You really want to dance with me? 
31578,c.j.,What are you doing in here? 
31581,c.j.,I want a copy of the daily schedule and Maryann the librarian over here told me I had to sign it out... 
31582,c.j.,And he crazy-glued my phone!!! 
31586,c.j.,"Okay. Well. Okay, it’s over. That’s that. "
31587,c.j.,"So, how long do you usually make people your bitch? "
31597,bartlet,Look at the whole board. 
31603,bartlet,Are they in the Taiwan Strait? 
31605,bartlet,Is that the same thing? 
31609,bartlet,Turn them around. I’ll make some calls and thank people. 
31611,bartlet,"Thank you, by the way. "
31620,bartlet,"Ten years, but you’ve got it. "
31624,bartlet, But everybody wakes up alive in the morning and saves a little face. 
31626,bartlet,You have a lot of help. You listen to everybody and then you call the play.  That’s checkmate. 
31634,bartlet," I love them. ""Laissez-faire doctrine."" 15 letters."
31636,bartlet,"No, that's not the answer. See, 'cause Social Darwinism isn't a doctrine. It's a  force of nature. The answer is ""libertarianism."" "
31640,bartlet,"Boo boo, I gave up on getting you out the door in the late 70's. Plus, it's your  birthday. You're old, and you don't move around that fast."
31642,bartlet,"I know, so I'm shading in the extra box. "
31644,bartlet,"It's your birthday week. It's a week of festivities like Mardi Gras or Lent. Three  letters. ""It may be bitter."" ""Tea,"" right?"
31648,bartlet,"'Cause ""woman"" doesn't fit."
31650,bartlet,"Hey, when the Medical Board gives you the results of the hearing, do they slap it up  on one of those X-ray light boards? ""Here's where the problem is with your testimony, Abbey. Here and here."""
31652,bartlet,"See, I know it sounds like you're praising me, but..."
31654,bartlet, It's not your life or 12 years of anything or anything. They're gonna give you  the very least they can give you.
31658,bartlet,Standing by your convictions isn't gonna get you anywhere. This isn't some guy off the  street talking. I'm a very successful politician.
31660,bartlet,"About 200, but that was five or six hours ago when it started."
31662,bartlet,"""Body organ, produces hydrochloric acid."" That's the kidney, right? Or the lima bean?"
31664,bartlet,"See, they can't take medical school away from you."
31667,bartlet,"I know you're scared. I'm very confident. So you be whatever you want. Whatever happens  happens tomorrow. Tonight is your birthday party, and your earrings are great, so are  your shoes. So can we, for the love of God, get out of this room?!"
31670,bartlet,"Pheasant and morel consomme, miniature ravioli of fois gras and smoked goose confit, a  little Canary melon sorbet as a palate cleanser, all served on the finest Lenox china."
31672,bartlet,A '97 Willamette Valley Pinot Noir. A '94 Hog Cellars Zinfandel.
31674,bartlet,"I'm like Gatsby, but without the problems."
31678,bartlet,I kind of wished you'd mentioned that before.
31680,bartlet, It's gonna be relaxed. It's gonna be relaxed.
31681,bartlet," For dessert, we're having Kumquat Napoleons."
31684,josh,"Happy birthday, Mrs. B."
31690,bartlet,Donna was invited. All the women of the west wing. We're doing a calendar.
31691,josh,I'm not sure what's keeping her.
31697,bartlet,"You know, John, there are places in the world where it might be considered rude to  talk about the physical attributes of another man's wife."
31701,bartlet,"Look, obviously, we knew this was gonna be a thing, but it doesn't have to be tonight,  right?"
31703,bartlet,I'm pretty sure he means Leo.
31712,c.j.,That's no problem. What's going on?
31714,c.j.,"Okay, and one of us... well, you... need to talk to Abbey tonight about tomorrow."
31716,c.j.,I'll get this other thing.
31719,c.j.,"No, it's C.J. Cregg. We've met."
31721,c.j.,I'm not at the party yet.
31723,c.j.,"Look, if you're planning on starting a rumble with Enlow, can I send the press home?"
31727,c.j.,I can say this about you. You can wear a tuxedo.
31761,josh,What are you doing here?
31767,josh,What are you doing here?
31771,josh,"Donna, you work in the White House. You fly with the President. What's the problem?"
31773,josh,Come with me. Come to the party.
31777,josh,They didn't tell you what the problem was?
31779,josh,You want me to get into it?
31805,bartlet,I'm gonna need you later.
31806,bartlet,I want to work on my toast.
31807,bartlet,I don't need help writing it. I can write a damn toast. I just want to say it out  loud to somebody. Any warm body is fine.
31808,bartlet,"So when I give you the signal, we'll go off someplace."
31809,bartlet,"It'll be something like ""Charlie, we're gonna go work on the toast now."""
31813,bartlet,I think Abbey's gonna pull a hamstring about tomorrow.
31817,bartlet,I'm feeling all right about it.
31819,bartlet, I don't know. She's pretty pissed.
31828,josh,I didn't know you were friends with the First Lady.
31829,josh,"Oh, sure, yeah. You know Amy Gardner?"
31830,josh,"Actually, you meant Sam."
31831,josh,"No, but as long as you heard I was great."
31833,josh,"Good seeing you, Chuck."
31835,josh,"No, Mugsy. Chuck Kane heads Intergovernmental Affairs at Treasury, and he wants a job  on the campaign as Deputy Political Director."
31837,josh,Mark Rothman and Robbie Gill.
31840,josh,They happen to be men.  They happen to be men.
31842,josh,We're in a dangerous area right now.
31843,josh,Let me tell you why this is a dangerous area. Because I can't make decisions based on  the fact that I like your smooth skin.
31844,josh,Don't try and trick me.
31846,josh,You're trying to trick me.
31847,josh,I'm gonna be scared for the rest of the night.
31852,josh,He went off with Charlie to work on his toast.
31861,toby," Good evening, Your, uh, Lordship."
31862,toby,You have objections to him coming to the White House?
31864,toby,"Well, let's hang on a second. Sinn Fein is a political party. In fact, the oldest in  Ireland."
31868,toby,He's not being honored. He's just been given an invitation.
31869,toby,"And I think we have to be careful how we use the word ""terrorist.""  Can I call  you John?"
31870,toby, You feel like a drink?
31872,toby,Let's go down the street. The guy keeps a bottle there.
31892,josh,I brought you some food.
31894,josh,"Well, I-I don't have all the answers, but it's pretty weird, so far."
31896,josh,Secret Service says there's an INS notation next to your name.
31904,josh,A mistake of some kind.
31908,josh,It'll just take a few more minutes.
31935,bartlet,"""I've known my wife, Abbey, for nearly 150 years."" No, I'm not gonna do that. She's  not gonna think that's funny."
31936,bartlet,"Okay. I should... Yeah. Okay. ""Thank you all for being here tonight."" By the way, do  you know where the term ""toast"" comes from?"
31939,bartlet,The Stuarts. They put a piece of toast in your wine cup to improve the flavor.
31940,bartlet,1643. Members of the Middle Temple toasted Princess Elizabeth by pledging to die in  her service.
31941,c.j.," Excuse me, Mr. President."
31942,bartlet,"C.J., I haven't seen you all night."
31943,c.j.,"I haven't been able to make it out there yet, sir. I've been tracking something down."
31946,c.j.,"A piece on the Manchester Union-Leader.  ""Sources close to Robert  Nolan, president of the New Hampshire Medical Board, predict that he will announce  his recusal from the case because of his personal..."""
31948,c.j.,"""...relationship with the Bartlets."" What does this mean for her?"
31949,bartlet,"We're pretty sure the Board was evenly divided, and Nolan was the deciding vote, which  dictated a lot of her... Damn it!"
31950,c.j.,There was a personal relationship.
31951,bartlet,"Yeah, they worked together for 20 years, and I was the governor who appointed him to  the Board."
31953,bartlet,"C.J., you should probably tell Abbey."
31956,c.j.,"Thank you, Mr. President. "
31957,bartlet,The Union-Leader says Nolan's gonna recuse himself.
31959,bartlet,They're gonna suspend her license for a year.
31963,bartlet,I was pretty concerned about that.
31965,bartlet,"Can you leave me alone? I'm trying to be a husband, and your mojo's getting all over me."
31967,bartlet,"This is Brendan McGann, right?"
31969,bartlet,Yeah. I don't know what to say about that.
31976,josh,Uh... we got it down to a few finals.
31978,josh,I can't help noticing these are all women.
31989,c.j.,"Thank you, ma'am, and so do you."
31990,c.j.,I need to speak with you for a second.
31992,c.j.,"No, I'm afraid not. Abbey, the Union-Leader's got sources saying Dr. Nolan's gonna  recuse himself from the case."
31999,josh,"You went over my head, and you did it behind my back."
32000,josh,What kind of position is Abbey Bartlet in to know anything...?
32025,toby,I think there's something to be said for giving McGann credibility by inviting him to  the White House. It strengthens his hand in-in dealing with the more violent members  of the party.
32026,toby,"We also think if we legitimize him, the Protestants will wake up and accept they've  got to negotiate with somebody."
32027,toby,There were many authors.
32029,toby,"We've had Arafat here, John."
32030,toby,It wasn't worth trying?
32031,toby,The President's not a kid.
32032,toby,"And wasn't it James Joyce who said, ""History is a nightmare from which I'm trying to  awake."""
32033,toby,You're saying we should butt out of Ireland until we know what we're doing?
32034,toby," Say, speaking of dead Irish writers..."
32036,c.j.,I'm gonna open the wine.
32040,c.j.,This is an excellent corkscrew. Just slides right in there like power steering. The right  tool for the job.  This corkscrew sucks. Should  I call the steward?
32052,c.j.,You're not an American?
32063,c.j.,I wouldn't worry about it.
32068,c.j.,Next best thing. It's in the bottle.
32071,c.j.,This is a good bottle of wine.  I don't understand. It was good  corkscrew. Graphite...
32072,c.j.,Stop talking about the corkscrew?
32077,c.j.,Your husband got eaten?
32079,c.j.,"Yeah. Well, I'm on dangling modifier patrol."
32081,c.j.,Are you First Lady right now?
32083,c.j.,"Sometimes you like to talk, and I think that's great, but sometimes you're Abbey, and  sometimes you're my boss, and I respect both very much, but..."
32085,c.j.,"Yes. I agree with her.  Look, they take this job away from me, I got  nothing. I don't have a cat. I could get one, but I don't have one. Frankly, I'm not  wild about cats. I don't hate them. I'm just not... I could learn to like them, I guess,  if I..."
32086,c.j.,"You've got a husband, children, a home and a life. And we're talking about one year of  your not having a medical license."
32090,c.j.,"Because it is, and you know it."
32095,c.j.,There's plenty of stuff left.
32105,bartlet,That's when the juices get flowing.
32106,bartlet,I could tell the story of the ditch digger.
32108,bartlet,"Abbey and I were walking along and we see a ditch digger, and I said, ""Aren't you glad  you married me? You could've married a ditch digger."" And she said, ""Jed, if I'd married  him, he'd be President."" What do you think?"
32113,bartlet,"In my house, anyone who uses one word when they could have used ten just isn't trying  hard. Let's keep at it."
32115,toby,"Well, they've given u s a couple of U.S. Presidents, a lot of Boston Democrats, and half  of the New York City's Police Force."
32117,toby,So wouldn't you say we were doing you a favor?
32118,toby,That is the act of a friend. What is left to do but talk? What could be better for that  wounded place than sitting down and talking? What is better than sitting down and talking?
32120,toby,Then what can we do but talk to him?
32122,toby,Brendan McGann cannot come to the White House.
32123,toby," Understood, Mr. Ambassador."
32154,josh,"Donna... Actually...  First of all, Amy..."
32155,josh," I understand, and I forgive you."
32159,josh,"Donna, you're an American again. INS has a grandfather clause. If you pass a three-part  literacy test, an American history exam, and fill out a one-page form, you're back."
32165,bartlet, What the hell is going on?!
32167,bartlet,I was gone for 45 minutes. They were all Americans when I left.
32169,bartlet,"I called Nolan. I know I shouldn't have, but I'm sorry. The rules are different when it  comes to my family. There isn't a man in America who doesn't understand that. I also  think partiality isn't a vice in this case. He knows you, and that's a good thing. He's  gonna consider not recusing himself."
32171,bartlet,"Okay. I'm gonna do a toast and everything in a minute, and I'll tell the ditch story,  but I wanted to say that I love you very much."
32176,bartlet,I'm standing right here!
32180,bartlet,Good to be talking to you.
32181,bartlet,The Mural Room as a matter of fact.
32182,bartlet,"That's right, and Thursday night we're going to talk about energy dependence versus  independence and cleaner burning fuels that get up to 80 miles per gallon versus  oil-based fuels that pump billions of pounds of pollution into our air and perhaps  just as important our vulnerable to very volatile price spikes. We want to talk about  controlling our destiny through innovation instead of relying so heavily on foreign oil."
32183,bartlet,"Yeah. 65% of the world's oil reserves are in the Mid East. 3% are here at home. I,  for one, wouldn't mind sending a little less of my money over there and the only  alternative is to use less oil."
32184,bartlet,"I hope so, but there'll be plenty of time for campaigning come the fall. Thursday night  is about America's energy future."
32186,bartlet,"I'm-- Terry, I'm sorry."
32187,bartlet,That was my ninth interview this morning.
32188,bartlet,"Well, I guess we'll be ready to run against whoever we have to run against."
32189,bartlet,Rob Ritchie? I don't know him very well.
32191,toby,They all want to talk about Ritchie's book.
32192,bartlet,We can talk about my book.
32193,toby,Theory and Design of Macro Economics in Developing Nations?
32196,toby,"When they say ""exploring"" you got to say ""drilling."" There's a 12 point kick with  ANWAR between ""exploring"" and drilling."""
32203,toby,"Well, that's all I've got."
32204,c.j.,Could you do me a favor? I just got faxed a letter from Tabitha Fortis. She says she's  not comfortable going ahead with the dinner next week unless she gets to chastise the  administration for backing off it's commitment to banning land mines. I'm sure its just  a matter of hand-holding. Would you ask Sam to talk to her?
32206,c.j.,I thought Sam 'cause he's more familiar with land mines.
32211,c.j.,Is it possible you've got a little touch of the poet? Or would like a little touch of the poet?
32213,c.j.,"Okay, then learn something about land mines, would you? We don't want to cancel. About  300 of the finest minds in the country are coming, plus some Congressmen."
32215,c.j.,"Knock 'em dead, de Bergerac."
32218,toby,"Nothing, I just meant, you know, okay."
32226,toby,Happiness is my default position.
32228,bartlet,Good morning. Thanks for having me.
32229,bartlet,"And to shill for my new energy plan, which is about raising fuel economy standards, working  with Detroit to develop hybrid cars, and using tax incentives to promote alternative energy."
32230,bartlet,"After a decade of wars with Iraq and a spread of religious extremism in Saudi Arabia, we  still rely on this very dangerous, very uncertain region for a quarter of our oil reserves.  And I, for one, wouldn't mind not sending quite so much of my money there."
32231,bartlet,Exploring is what Magellan did and Balboa and Jacques Cousteau. What we're talking about  is drilling which is the only way you know if there's oil there and which will forever  damage national treasures like ANWAR.
32232,bartlet,Clean Coal is a term that pollsters came up with 'cause it polls higher then regular coal.  What we want are real cleaner burning fuels. We want to control our destiny through  innovation and that's what we're going to be talking about Thursday night.
32236,bartlet,There'll be plenty of bait in September-October.
32237,bartlet,I'll read it when he does.
32238,bartlet,"I don't know, Leslie. I think we might be talking about a .22 caliber mind in a .357 magnum world."
32239,bartlet,"Okay, thanks again.  Who's next?"
32242,toby,When you said that just now. You were hot. They've got it on b-roll.
32243,josh,How'd the tape get out already?
32245,c.j.,There was a local AP reporter at the station in Philly.
32246,josh,They didn't want to keep it for an exclusive?
32247,c.j.,It's better for them to have their call letters splashed on every... and the networks  will carry it tonight.
32248,josh,"This is amateur crap, Sam. How'd it happen?"
32252,josh,"All right, you're right. What's first?"
32253,c.j.,I have the briefing room in 20 minutes.
32254,josh,What do you think you're going to get?
32255,c.j.,Is the President saying Governor Ritchie's stupid?
32259,josh,"Why not, the President has the highest regard for Governor Ritchie. Believes he's a broad  thinker and a dedicated public servant?"
32261,josh,I'm more concerned with how the President sounds.
32262,c.j.,I've got 80 boys and girls in there who don't make the distinction. And if I pretend Bobby  Ritchie's a nuclear physicist...
32264,c.j.,"No, we're focusing on this this week. I can try a non-apology apology."
32266,c.j.,"""The President didn't realize that the camera was hot and he said something he shouldn't  have, as we all do from time to time."""
32269,josh,And we hold our heads high. All right.
32271,josh,Why do you suppose this one's so hard to spin?
32272,c.j.,'Cause it's the classic Washington scandal. We screwed up by telling the truth.
32273,josh,All right. Lets try not to do that that much.
32279,josh,What are you talking about?
32285,josh,What do they talk about?
32290,josh,"All right, can everybody who doesn't work here, please go work where they work."
32291,josh,You can get this at your own desk.
32294,josh,Let me look at this thing.
32296,josh,Right. Yes. Let me know when C.J.'s briefing starts.
32299,bartlet,We hearing from the Michigan delegation?
32301,bartlet,Polluters aren't going to write the environmental laws. What about the Energy's Workers Union?
32309,bartlet,"Let me ask you something. You're pretty dumb, did you take offense? Look at that. I did it again."
32315,bartlet,I don't know. I guess the biggest names.
32318,c.j.,"The President didn't realize the camera was hot, and he said something he shouldn't have.  Something we all do from time to time."
32320,c.j.,"Yeah, again, he said something he shouldn't have and he wouldn't have if he knew it was  going to be for public consumption."
32321,c.j.,"There's a reason they call it private, Stuart."
32322,bartlet,"All right, I'm going back to work."
32324,c.j.,The voters get to make those kinds of judgments.
32327,c.j.,"As I said yesterday, the President didn't realize the camera was hot and he said  something he shouldn't have. Katie?"
32328,c.j.,"Well, for one thing, while the Governor is the presumptive Republican nominee, it's  presumptive. For that matter, so is the President's renomination. But more important  than that, the President has been a candidate in seven statewide and national elections  and every one of them has been a substantive, issued-based campaign, which is one of  several reasons why the voters have elected him each and every time his name has  appeared on a ballot. Phil?"
32329,c.j.,You mean since yesterday?
32331,c.j.,"I've never asked him, but my guess is the President feels that a person's college  transcripts is a reasonable barometer of how a person did in college.   For the record, the President graduated Summa Cum Laude from the University of  Notre Dame with a major in American Studies and a minor in theology. He received a  Masters and a Doctorate at the London School of Economics and an honorary Doctorate  in Humane Letters from Dartmouth University where he was a tenured professor."
32335,c.j.,Of course he is. Don't give him what he wants.
32337,c.j.,"We cant hold a bipartisan summit on bipartisanism, we'll look ridiculous."
32341,c.j.,"Is it me, or is Ritchie's people handling this wrong?"
32343,c.j.,Why keep it alive? There's no way for them to look good. The President was mean  to mean? Let it go. 
32366,josh,Sit down we’re gonna post a response on the site.
32370,josh,"Yeah, we got to post a response to someone."
32376,josh,What's wrong with them?
32378,josh,These are people taking a very healthy interest in government. They should be applauded.
32380,josh,These are the people talking. I'm not an elitist.
32382,josh,"I am an elitist, but I have respect for people who don't measure up."
32384,josh,We've got to correct something.
32386,josh,"Irmatrude writes, ""Three nights ago on Nightline Josh said, 'We'll be asking for a GAO  study of Medicare drug pricing.' Apparently, no one's told Josh that only Congress can  ask the GAO to do anything."" First of all, how cool is that, that they know what the  GAO can and can't do?"
32390,josh,"Sit down. Irmatrude... Thanks for watching me on Nightline. Yes, I do know that only  Congress can instruct the GAO. When I said, ""We'll be asking,"" I meant Democrats and  not the White House. Thank you for your concern, Josh ""Lemon"" Lyman."
32394,josh,"You could get more in the spirit of this, you know."
32402,toby,"This necktie, does it go with the jacket?"
32403,josh,"God, I don't know Toby. The tie, is it red or is it green?"
32404,toby,"Congratulations, you're the hundredth person to make that joke."
32412,toby,That's why no one writes poetry about me.
32413,toby,"Yeah, but he hasn't yet."
32416,toby,"I think if you ask around, you'll discover that's unlikely. Do you want to come back  to my office?"
32417,toby,The President's open-mike gaffe.
32419,toby,"Sam, say hello to the newly-minted United States Poet Laureate, Tabitha Fortis."
32423,toby,We can't get enough of it.
32426,toby,"Exactly 63 feet from the Oval Office. If you don't think we measure, you're out of  your mind. Okay. So. Hello."
32428,toby,"We have arranged a dinner in your honor. We've invited 300 important people, we've invited  the press, we've shined our shoes..."
32429,toby,Whoa... What happened to the nuance of diplomacy?
32430,toby,"No we-we're there now, you-you can't go back."
32433,toby,You know who initiated it? Us. And the nations of the world rallied around it in yet  another impressive display of American leadership.
32435,toby,"And the reason we did is because we love anti-personnel land mines. We love 'em. And we  think the government should be in the business of selling them, like the Post Office.  In fact, the Post Office is the sales venue we've been considering."
32436,toby,"It's Korea. Tabitha. There are 900,000 North Korean soldiers in the DMZ, and the only  thing stopping them from walking into South Korea are 37,000 US troops, and about a  million land mines along the border. We have said over and over that we would be thrilled  to sign this treaty if we could have an exemption for South Korea and we have been rebuffed.  Rebuffed... I say."
32438,toby,If you voice your disagreement at a party in your honor hosted by the President with the  press in attendance then it's a gigantic deal which travels the 63 feet right to this office.
32440,c.j.,"Well, I think this one may be unspinnable. That's certainly saying something coming from  my office. Yeah, he was calling him stupid."
32441,c.j.,He hasn't been able to feed or bathe himself.
32442,c.j.,"Mark, I swear to God, as soon as the President needs help understanding the hearts and  minds of the American people, he'll call the Republican Governor of Florida. But this  week, we're focused on tomorrow night's press conference wherein we unveil our national  strategy for energy independence. Speaking of which, this country has been dependent on  foreign oil for far too long. 65% of our crude oil reserves comes from the Gulf. Only  three percent here at home."
32443,c.j.,"Yeah, well, we all tried to convince the President that talking about policy was just  plain unsportmanlike, but we didn't get anywhere. Listen, I've had a lot of fun, and I  know you have, too. I'll see you later."
32448,c.j.,"It will do huge and lasting damage to the environment, and it would not, in the long run,  reap that much oil."
32451,c.j.,You've been reading his book?
32452,c.j.,"""A Promise to Lead"", Ritchie's book."
32453,c.j.,"Carol, would you put together a page on the environmental impact of drilling the Artic  National Wildlife Reserve?"
32479,c.j.,We've gone from one network carrying the press conference tomorrow night to four.
32482,toby,I guess we shouldn't be surprised.
32483,c.j.,No. Where are you going?
32486,toby,Tabitha's never been to Washington.
32487,c.j.,"You going to get that thing done, or you want me to talk to her?"
32490,toby,She's a poet. She's new to things like consequences.
32493,c.j.,"Listen, I have a crazy thought. Is it possible...?"
32495,c.j.,"Hmm, never mind. I'll see you later."
32498,josh,Something weird has happened here.
32502,josh,They don't seem to be taking my response in the spirit in which it was intended.
32504,josh,"Seems to be a very unusual social structure. For instance, there is leader who seems  to pride herself on her organizational skills and a certain amount of discipline."
32506,josh," Well, she does seems to do an awful lot of scolding. ""You've  posted in the wrong place. Stay on topic people. Don't use capital letters. I don't have  time to tell you twice,"" when clearly, she does have time to tell us twice. But that's  not the problem."
32508,josh,"""Someone need to deal with Josh's planet-sized ego, by teaching him government 101.  Who made him overlord of the Democratic party?"" And someone else writes, ""Is Josh  delusional, or is he actively trying to destroy the separation of powers?"""
32511,josh,I think I need to clarify my original post.
32517,josh,"I'm dictating now. I don't think it falls under the category of ""outrageous"" to suggest  that I might have friends on the other end of the Avenue who have the phone number of  the GAO. Let me put this more plainly. The White House can get a GAO review of anything  it wants without posing a threat to the separation of powers. And I believe I'll use  capital, lowercase, or Sanskrit, right up until the moment the font police cuff me and  read me Miranda!"
32519,josh,"See, I think these are good people, by and large, but they've come under the thumb of a  dictatorial ruler. So, as with a small, Central American country, my role is to incite  the people to topple her"
32521,josh,"No, but do we have any Yoo-Hoo?"
32527,toby,I'll let you know if it happens.
32528,toby,We have you watched when you're in D.C.
32530,toby,We always have you watched.
32531,toby,"So, you know what I was thinking might be fun?"
32532,toby,That's not what I was going to say at all.
32533,toby,"If you came to the dinner, wore a beautiful dress, and shut the hell up."
32534,toby,We're aware of all nine.
32535,toby,I work in communications.
32536,toby,"The President of the United States requests the honor of your presence, and I'm sorry,  but you show up."
32537,toby,"Not every minute of the damn day, Tabitha."
32538,toby,Can we stop with the drama?
32539,toby,"Tabitha, you don't know what you're doing. This isn't kid's stuff. If you stand up in the  President's face, that's going to be the story, and nobody's going to care about what you  care about. Nobody is going to care about what you care about. And... It'll be bad... for  you, for us, for the land mines, everybody."
32542,bartlet,"(singing) Another sky Another June Another something that rhymes with June Another reason, another season For making... (stops singing) Wait a sec."
32543,bartlet,"No, wait a sec. He's absolutely right. Hang on."
32544,bartlet,"Excuse me. I'm sorry for interrupting. No, no, keep your seats. Leo? You're absolutely right."
32546,bartlet,"We shouldn't show up. Tell the Whip we want to yield all our time. While they're going  in front of the cameras complaining about me making fun of Ritchie, the Democrats will  be caucusing on literacy and tuition tax credits. We want to yield all our time."
32549,c.j.,"The President will begin his press conference at nine, or more accurately, the walk down  the red carpet will happen at 9:01:30, per the network's request. He'll deliver an opening  statement on his National Strategy for Energy Independence, we expect that'll last about  15 minutes, and then the President will take questions for 45 minutes."
32565,toby,"She has no history of activism. She said something yesterday, when I was with her, she said-  she was talking about land mines - she said, ""From everything I've seen and everything I've  been told..."""
32569,josh,The Internet people have gone crazy.
32571,josh,"They're calling the GAO ""General Josh's Standing Army"", and saying I don't understand  it's mandate and purpose. They're saying if I could get a review of anything I want,  that I should start by reviewing the job of Deputy C.O.S. Then one guy compares me to  a poor man's Clark Clifford, and a page and a half of posts, debating whether or not  I was mocking Egyptians with the Sanskrit reference."
32573,josh,I thought you meant they were funny.
32575,josh,"I know they're not! It's ""Lord of the Flies"" in there."
32577,josh,"It's got my name on it. Look, I don't want to hear about it anymore.   We got an energy plan in ten minutes. I'm gonna..."
32580,c.j.,The Federal Page of the Washington Post just called Carol to confirm that you're the  Josh Lyman who stated on an Internet website that the White House could order a GAO  review on anything it wants.
32581,josh,Without threatening the separation of powers is what I was saying.
32582,c.j.,You posted on a web site?
32583,josh,I was communicating with the people.
32585,josh,"C.J., it's a... crazy place. It's got this dictatorial leader, who I'm sure wears a muumuu  and chain smokes Parliaments. "
32586,c.j.,What did you go there for in the first place?
32587,josh,It's called LemonLyman.com.
32588,c.j.,"Let me explain something to you, this is sort of my field. The people on these sites?  They're the cast of ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest."" "
32589,josh," I didn't swoop in, I came in exactly the same way everybody else did."
32590,c.j.,"Well, now I'm telling you to open the ward room window and climb on out before they give you  a pre-frontal lobotomy, and I have to smother you with a pillow."
32592,c.j.,"I'm Chief Bromden, yes, at this particular moment. I'm assigning an intern from the press  office to that web site. They're going to check it every night before they go home. If they  discover you've been there, I'm going to shove a motherboard so far up your ass... "
32594,josh," Well... technically, I outrank you."
32601,c.j.,I believe we are. You want to walk over?
32602,josh," Donna, let's go, it's time."
32607,toby,Was there any press there tonight?
32613,toby,I have to be at a press conference.
32614,c.j.,"So as a matter of cold fact, Chipper, you'll see that it's the Porcupine Caribou, and  ANWARS's their calving ground, and you can't put a price tag on that, but that's hardly  the point."
32615,c.j.,"Well, forget the wildlife, it hurts flesh and blood subsistence hunters in the area,  changes migratory patterns in ways we don't even understand, increases freezing depths  of rivers and lakes..."
32616,c.j.,"Welcome home, it'll cause pollutant haze and acid rain, and all this in exchange for?"
32617,bartlet,"All right, here we go. What time is it?"
32621,bartlet,"I've been meaning to tell you, you've done really well this week with the open-mike thing."
32623,bartlet,Didn't turn out too bad.
32624,c.j.,"No sir, it didn't turn out too bad at all. In fact, the whole country's talking about  whether Ritchie's smart enough to be President. And you didn't take hit, 'cause it was an  accident. You know, it occurs to me that even your choice of language was interesting.  ""A .22 caliber mind, in a .357 magnum world."" That's unusual for you, a gun metaphor. "
32634,josh,Your team would get scored on constantly.
32636,josh,"Yeah, 'cause sumo wrestling sells out all the time in big hockey towns."
32638,josh,"Well, you're a Democrat. It's a pretty big club."
32640,josh,"Uh, health, education and welfare is marking up the Internet Education Act tomorrow."
32644,josh,An hour ago. They're zeroing out the Technology Challenge Fund.
32646,josh,You want to know for how long? I was working for him when he created it.
32650,josh,"I think he's gonna say, ""Josh, you look remarkably like Sam Seaborn."""
32656,josh,"I don't have the best relationship with Hoynes, and neither does Leo."
32658,josh,"Well, we don't want you to say I'm sorry. We want you to work with him and save the bill."
32660,josh,His office is expecting you in 20 minutes.
32666,josh,No big deal. You'll find out when you get there.
32669,josh,I've lost my binder from National Strategies.
32671,josh,The black one with the secret launch codes.
32673,josh,"I also need the Cabinet Affairs amplification report, and if you can get th AP farm guy  back online, I'm almost sure Toby gave me a punchier quote on Ag reorganization."
32677,josh,How about a weekly salary of some kind?
32683,josh,"For me, it was Mr. Feig for American History AP and Con Law."
32685,josh,And the big favor you want?
32687,josh,"No. I think that moment's done, except to say that he meant the whole world to me, and  he died four years ago."
32689,josh,Not quite as bad as dying.
32695,josh,That would be a nice letter from the principal.
32697,josh,"A little piece of paper? Proclamations have the full force of law. The Emancipation  Proclamation, to name just one."
32699,josh,"Listen. I-I don't know what's involved with these things. Probably have advisory boards,  commissions, the NATO commander's involved, prossibly."
32701,josh,"Yeah, but find me the blue notebook first."
32703,josh,I'm going to the meeting now.
32705,toby,"If I said no, would it stop you?"
32709,toby,"So instead of trailing 18 third world countries in reading and math, we trail how many?"
32711,toby,Tomorrow's no good. We've got half a dozen events on the books.
32713,toby,"And tomorrow, we're trying to make news on five of our other number one priorities.  Don't you have a meeting?"
32715,toby,"Oh, I'll check the calendar."
32717,toby,Where to find a chisel and a stone tablet.
32718,toby,I need to know what the Cabinet's doing tomorrow.
32719,toby,"Ideally, sometime before tomorrow."
32720,toby,Is it... Go back. What's at noon?
32721,toby,"No, the Housing Secretary."
32722,toby,Page the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. I want to see him in my office.
32724,toby,I'm in the Roosevelt Room.
32726,bartlet,"Okay. We're e-filing the old 1040A. You're single, head of your household, Deanna's a  dependent, your adjusted gross income is $35,000 per annum."
32731,bartlet,Suckers. Okay. Your mom's Social Security pension benefits is $1536. Police pension $2400.
32732,bartlet,"""Do you take standard deduction, or do you itemize?"""
32733,bartlet,Did you make any charitable donations?
32735,bartlet, You're better off with the standard deduction.
32736,bartlet,"I'm hitting 'send' now. If you're lying about any of this, you're going to the joint."
32737,bartlet,"It's gonna tell us what your refund is, but I've done a quick calculation, and it'll be  $700."
32738,bartlet,"You spent it already, haven't you?"
32740,bartlet,Can I tell you what's messed up about James Bond?
32741,bartlet,Shaken not stirred will get you cold water with a dash of gin and dry vermouth. The  reason you stir it with a special spoon is so not to chip the ice. James is ordering a  weak martini and being snooty about it.
32745,bartlet,And you don't even need a stamp. Hand it over.
32746,bartlet,Whatever. Hand it over.
32747,bartlet,That's not quite how we see it.
32749,c.j.,"Good evening, Mr. President."
32752,bartlet,"Let's go inside.  Milo, Coop, would you help Mr. Young find his pockets, please?"
32753,c.j.,"I'm sorry to come straight to you, but Leo's unavailable right now. You should be getting  a call from the Energy Secretary any minute."
32755,c.j.,The wire service is reporting that a heavy-haul vehicle carrying depleted uranium fuel  rods crashed in the Seven Devil Mountains in Idaho.
32757,c.j.,"It was hit head-on by another truck, in the Goldfield Tunnel on Route 234."
32758,bartlet,Are there populated areas nearby?
32759,c.j.,"Elk Horn's about 20 miles away with a population of 20,000."
32761,bartlet,Conference in the Chief with the Radiological Assistance Team.
32762,bartlet,"Charlie, get me Fitzwallace, Nancy McNally, and let the senior members of the NSC know  I might need them tonight."
32763,c.j.,"Thank you, Mr. President. "
32765,c.j.,A truck carrying depleted uranium fuel rods just crashed in Idaho 20 miles from a  populated town.
32766,josh,"Well, what's happening right now?"
32767,c.j.,"The President's talking to Tommy about the radiation threat, and he's talking to some  National Security people."
32771,toby,You said he was also talking to National Security People.
32772,c.j.,"Two trucks in a completely deserted area, and they just happen to crash into each other?  I'd want to talk to somebody at least."
32773,josh,"All right. Listen, postpone the meeting. "
32775,josh,It's gonna be all night.
32776,toby,"When we get pulled out, we get pulled out."
32777,josh,It doesn't really seem appropriate right now.
32778,toby,You spent a long night with Bruno last night.
32779,josh,"Yeah, and Bruno spent a long night with Doug the night before."
32781,josh,There's no electoral math they can come up with. None. That says it's not worth exploring  replacing the Vice President on the ticket.
32782,toby,"Not five months ago, in this room I'd said-I joked--that if we win re-election it was  going to be on the Vice-President's coattails. The way I'm sure I said it is that it was  leaked. How has the electoral math changed since then?"
32783,josh,"By the way... the group of people were chosen because they're the people Leo wanted to  hear from tonight but also, because he was confident their wouldn't be a leak and I hope  we live up to that."
32784,toby,How has the math changed?
32785,josh,"Bruno doesn't think that Hoynes buys us Texas with Ritchie in the race. If we loose Texas  this time, we loose Florida this time, that's a third of the electoral votes we need to  win. There's a reason the Republicans are nominating this man."
32788,c.j.,Who does win Texas for us?
32789,josh,"Nobody, we're loosing Texas."
32790,toby,"Wait a second, before we go on to who does win Texas."
32792,toby,We've been talking about this for a minute and 17 sec and we're already discussing new  candidates?
32793,c.j.,I was saying that if no ones going to win us Texas then why change it all?
32794,josh,Can I make it clear that nobody's advocating anything?
32796,josh,Bruno asked for a discussion.
32797,toby,"The Northeast, the Pacific coast and the industrial Northwest. "
32798,josh,Yeah. If we don't have Florida and Texas it'd mean we'd have to sweep those three.
32800,josh,He thinks someone else could help us more.
32804,josh,"Fitzwallace. He said Fitzwallace, Toby. And when you think about it..."
32809,josh,Ah... you know... we're just starting.
32815,bartlet,What would you have done a half hour ago that hasn't already been done?
32817,bartlet,"I know. If only technology could invent some way to get in touch with you in an  emergency. Some sort of telephonic device with a personalized number we could call to let  you know that we needed you. Perhaps it would look something like this, Mr. Moto!  "
32821,bartlet,You know I've noticed that other people keep a set of comfortable clothes in their office  for when they have to work late. I like that -- you should do that too.
32830,bartlet,I'm pretty sure he's right.
32834,bartlet,I knew this a half hour ago.
32836,bartlet,This whole night I'm going to be a half hour smarter than you.
32844,bartlet,Is that his name or is that what we think it is right now?
32846,bartlet,In what happens to be the most dangerous and unanticipated situation for the  transportation of nuclear waste.
32848,bartlet, What's that meeting next door?
32850,josh,"Did I leave a folder called ""Southeast Targets and..."" "
32857,josh,He can't just issue a proclamation.
32859,josh,"No I'm saying he can't just because you want him to. What's next, executive clemency if  you're having a bad hair day?"
32861,josh,"Which is nice but these things are for important causes, not individual perks for  staffers."
32865,josh,"Look, if you're going to mock the dead..."
32867,josh,It's still the President's name and reputation. We haven't vetted this woman.
32869,josh,If she were a lesbian we could talk. I'm saying what if she's a bicycle thief?
32871,josh,"Don't doubt it. Know it. Do a Google search, then talk to me."
32887,toby,Does anyone even know if he's a Democrat?
32889,josh,"These guys are right. Black turn out would explode, we'd realign the country."
32890,c.j.,That's assuming it stays a two-man race.
32891,josh,Who's going to get into it this late?
32893,josh,"Hoynes, as... an Independent?"
32895,josh,The guy practically has corporate sponsorship. The Tostitos Vice President is going to  lead an independent movement?
32896,josh,It is that ridiculous! He'd be finished in politics.
32897,toby,Some future he'll have after we publicly humiliate him by kicking him off the ticket.
32898,josh,"So, bring it on. What are we afraid of?"
32899,c.j.,How about a household name with his own base of conservative Democrats and populist  Independents.
32900,toby,"Starts at 15, maybe 20%. Now, every state's up for grabs 'cause it's a three way."
32902,c.j.,"Which is gratifying, of course but not much of a consolation since we'll loose too."
32903,josh,"You say what you want, Hoynes is a pragmatist. To do this, he'd be the craziest Vice  President since Aaron Burr-and Burr shot a guy.  I can't believe we're  talking about this."
32905,josh,I'm getting that a lot these days.
32906,c.j.,So... that leaves us where?
32907,josh,Wondering if Fitzwallace is a Democrat or a Republican.
32922,bartlet,A trip to Banana Republic would have killed you?  Let's go.
32924,bartlet,That's never been a problem for us before.
32926,bartlet,"Well, that's FEMA's call, isn't it?"
32928,bartlet,"I should set a ransom. I'll tell you what the radiation levels are, but first I want your  electoral votes. Or is that a bad strategy?"
32930,bartlet,"Okay, no ransom. We'll play this one straight. What about other shipments?"
32932,bartlet,Have we stopped the train?
32936,bartlet,They beefed up the escort?
32940,c.j.,Grant works as an example in almost any situation.  That's Grant's legacy.
32941,toby,Plus he won the Civil War.
32944,josh,As running mate. Bartlet-McGarry. 
32946,josh,It's not absurd you know.
32948,josh,It's not totally absurd.
32950,toby,He wants your parking space.
32952,c.j.,It's not totally absurd.
32954,c.j.,"You know, if it weren't for the drinking and the valium... And yet Grant... "
32956,c.j.,"And yet Grant. They went to Lincoln. They said, ""Grant's a drunk"". He said, ""Send all my  generals a case of whatever he's drinking""."
32958,josh,Hey... Leo. That didn't mean anything?
32960,josh, What's going on in Idaho?
32964,josh,We've done this before?
32966,josh,This is a radioactive cloud.
32968,josh,You wouldn't call it the end of the Yankee game either.
32970,josh,Civil defence volunteers?
32972,josh,"Still, we're talking about widespread panic and chaos, right?"
32974,josh,I don't want to go back to my meeting.
32984,toby,Where's Secretary Fisher?
32988,toby, Call Fisher or his scheduler and say that I want the Secretary here in half  an hour to talk about moving his announcement to the White House briefing room... 'cause  we have more TV cameras.
32989,toby,The most dangerous place in Washington is between Bill Fisher and a TV camera.
32997,josh,We are just a little rococo aren't we?
32999,josh,I wish I knew who General Pulaski was.
33001,josh,She's not less worthy. But neither is she more worthy than the other 90 000 public school  teachers who are retiring this year.
33003,josh,But that's where we get into trouble.
33005,josh,"""Who would find out"" is also where we frequently find trouble."
33012,josh,He's taking his name off it?
33014,josh,"Well, it feels like we're almost done in there."
33018,josh,Bruno wanted us to look at replacing Hoynes. 
33020,josh,"So, we're looking at it. What's the big...? We're looking at it. And everybody's treating  me like..."
33022,josh,There's electoral math.
33028,josh,"Fitzwallace, Leo, and Ulysses S. Grant."
33047,toby,"Yeah. Have you announced for the Governor of New Jersey, Bill?"
33048,toby,Did I miss and announcement somewhere?
33049,toby,"'Cause I've never heard of these home ownership loans, so I'm assuming it's a campaign  proposal. Camden and Newark will go nuts but I know it's not a national program."
33050,toby,You know how I know? 'Cause national programs are announced by the President of the  United States unless this White House passes on them first.
33051,toby,You're right. I forgot. We're announcing a brand new replacement for Social Security  tomorrow. 
33052,toby," They're not your nickels, Bill. They're not your dimes."
33053,toby,"Apparently you don't want his help, you're too busy helping yourself."
33054,toby,"There's one name on the ballot this November, Bill. Not yours, not mine. Not the Governor  of New Jersey. And believe me no one will work harder than Jed Bartlet to put you there.  But this President looses re-election and your career's finished, and so is mine."
33055,toby, Next time you announce new policy that isn't cleared by this office we're  announcing you're moving back to New Jersey.
33056,toby,C.J. will announce them tomorrow from the podium. 
33057,toby,This is too small for the President. I've got to go back to a meeting.
33058,bartlet,Yup. It was the rebate.
33060,bartlet,We wanted to inject some money into retail and tourism.
33061,bartlet,The economy might have improved on its own by then.
33063,bartlet,Not that much. Most people did what you did. They saved or they paid down debt.
33064,bartlet,"We do, but when the next guy's President."
33066,bartlet,I'll tell you what I find interesting though.
33067,bartlet,"You. $35,000 a year, a sister to support, and you gave $1,435 to charity. I'm not so  sure that check isn't better off in your hands than ours. Oh, I'm taking it. Don't be  ridiculous. But when you get to your place tonight you're going to find a new DVD player  and that wimp-ass Bond movie."
33068,bartlet,And I threw in Yeoman of the Guard on CD.
33073,bartlet,"Yeah. Charlie, let's get that woman on the phone. I'm feeling magical tonight."
33074,bartlet,They're in the tunnel now and the readings don't show anything beyond the predictable  level of background radiation. The flatbed is back on its way and the Carlsbad is behind  gates so we dodged the bullet.
33076,bartlet,"We packed this stuff in 2 inches of stainless steel, 4 inches of lead. We've rammed it  with trains and dropped it from helicopters and it still isn't going to protect us from  the thing we haven't thought of. They took a cask out to Aberdeen Proving Ground and shot  a TOW missile clean through it. They showed me video. What can I do for you?"
33081,bartlet,Is there anybody left who's not?
33084,bartlet,For how long have you been in recovery?
33086,bartlet,You haven't had a drink since you were 22?
33087,bartlet,I didn't start drinking till I was 25. What the hell do you guys count as...
33089,bartlet,You and James Bond ought to team up.
33091,bartlet,"He's ordering a watered down martini, and Leo what the hell is this meeting that's going  on all night across the hall?"
33095,bartlet,"Hey, did I hear right? Are you taking your name off that bill?"
33096,bartlet,You're taking your name off. We can't campaign on it.
33097,bartlet,"And if somebody's attacking us, you know what to do. "
33098,bartlet," Yeah, but don't discount the possibility  that it might be Leo."
33099,bartlet,"John, despite this recent revelation that you drank beer in college I've always liked you  a little more than you thought I did, but that's not why you're staying. It's this.   Four words. "
33101,bartlet,"Me, too. Anything else?"
33104,bartlet,Let's go. I'm a magic man.
33107,bartlet,Tell Josh that General Pulaski was a Polish Brigadier General who vanquished the Russian  and Prussian military then came to the colonies and commanded our cavalry during the  American revolution.
33109,bartlet,"It says here in a briefing paper hastily written by Deputy Josh Lyman that in the '60s  when the Madison Superintendent of Schools banned Twelfth Night for reasons passing  understanding, a Mrs. Molly Morello had students over to her house on Saturdays to  read it. "
33111,bartlet,Yeah 'cause all I had tonight was a nuclear spill in Idaho. It says she came in two hours  early to teach an AP English class she developed herself because the school didn't offer  one.
33113,bartlet,"Sounds like she deserves a proclamation. I wish I could give her one, but I can't. "
33115,bartlet,"It's just too much inside baseball, you know?"
33117,bartlet,"Charlie, I've been tapping my finger on the desk for about a minute now."
33118,bartlet,"The magic man thing works a lot better when you pick up on the signals, Tonto. What's  that you say? There's a phone call for Donna? "
33119,bartlet,"Good evening, this is the White House, for whom are you holding?"
33125,bartlet, Tell her where you are.
33127,bartlet, She didn't do anything.
33128,bartlet,"It's Jed Bartlet, Mrs. Morello. I've got a few questions. When you taught Beowulf, did  you make the kids read it in the original Middle English or did you use a translation?"
33129,bartlet,Okay. We're going to call that the James Bond version.
33130,bartlet,What are you planning on doing with your retirement?
33131,bartlet,I'd stay away from the Elk Horn area of Idaho for a little while. You'll read why in the  morning. Let's talk about Twelfth Night.
33133,c.j.,You haven't' had a drink since you were 22?
33134,c.j.,Ulysses S. Grant would have slapped your face.
33135,josh,"Listen, it's fine that this is funny and Mr. Vice President I couldn't care less, but  what about the campaign?"
33137,josh,The President just got passed an honesty issue.
33139,josh,If it becomes public...
33140,c.j.,That's a big assumption.
33143,josh,"""Because I could die."" Well, of course he's right, sir."
33145,josh,I don't know. I'm open to new ideas.
33147,c.j.,Not Fredonia? We're going to leave Fredonia out there?
33148,toby,"The point is, the zero option's off the table."
33149,c.j.,Hooray for Captain Spalding... 
33151,c.j.,"Hey, aren't we pretty much admitting all the countries we formed NATO to fight?"
33153,c.j.,Then why not dissolve it?
33154,toby,We like the bomber jackets.
33155,c.j.," See, when you make a joke... "
33157,c.j.,Fredonia was pretty good.
33159,c.j.," I'll give you $500 if you perform ""Lydia the Tattooed Lady"" at this year's Gridiron."
33161,toby,We're not done talking about the summit!
33163,toby,"And, you know, you of all people... the Russians finally elect a reformer, and you still... "
33165,c.j.," There was a fire at the King Fatah Middle School in Media.  Seventeen girls died in the fire, when they were prevented from coming out into the  street and rescue workers were prevented from saving them."
33167,c.j.,"The Muttawa. The girls weren't dressed properly. Don't comment! I haven't spoken to  the President, to Leo, to State, to anybody. You guys want to muzzle me before I go  in there, speak now or forever hold your peace. God knows it's not likely I'm gonna. "
33168,toby, Let's get a good spot.
33170,c.j.,"I have some scheduled details on the summit. Air Force One will depart Andrews at  7pm Friday, arriving at Helsinki 4am Eastern time, that's 11am Saturday local.  Presidents Bartlet and Chigorin will have their first meeting at three o'clock at  Mantyniemi - that's change, photo op, stills only, at the beginning of the meeting."
33171,c.j.,"Well, first to meet the new Russian president, but they show the aspiration of  building a secure and undivided Europe."
33172,c.j.,"Yeah, that's a tragedy. Chris?"
33173,c.j.,"Yeah, I read that too. Steve."
33174,c.j.,"I literally just got this a minute and a half ago. I haven't spoken to the President,  or Chief of Staff, State or anyone in communications, this is just me."
33176,c.j.," Outraged? I'm barely surprised. This is a country where women aren't allowed  to drive a car. They're not allowed to be in the company of any man other than a close  relative, they're required to adhere to a dress code that would make the Maryknoll Nun  look like Malibu Barbie. They beheaded 121 people last year for robbery, rape, and drug  trafficking, they've no free press, no elected government, no political parties, and  the royal family allows the religious police to travel in groups of six, carrying  nightsticks and they freely and publicly beat women. But ""Brutus is an honorable man.""  Seventeen schoolgirls were forced to burn alive because they weren't wearing the proper  clothing. Am I outraged? No, Steve. No Chris. No, Mark. That is Saudi Arabia, our  partners in peace. Bonnie, then Scott."
33201,c.j.,Yeah. Where are we going?
33203,c.j., Yeah. They're very angry faxes.
33207,c.j.,Very angry faxes from Saudis and angry e-mails. Look at these.
33215,c.j.,"Yeah. Don't tell anybody, okay, I don't want a lot of production."
33222,josh,Call Frank Tenney downstairs. Tell him I want to talk to him right away.
33224,c.j.,You take this seriously?
33225,josh,"Yeah, it's a death threat, C.J., I take it seriously. "
33226,bartlet,Thank you all so much. Bye-bye. 
33235,bartlet, What are you talking about?
33237,bartlet,That's got to be 50 million chips!
33239,bartlet,"Leo, how the hell did... "
33241,bartlet,That's the end of Antares.
33243,bartlet,"98 thousand workers, I think 75 thousand in the US. Plus the kidney punch at NASDAQ... "
33246,bartlet," Fitz! Fitz, you old polecat, you old so-and-so!"
33251,bartlet,What do you use heavy water for?
33254,toby,I think it's time we made it 'Toby.'
33255,toby,That's a nice uniform. How long have you guys had that uniform?
33258,toby," I'm gonna tell you something, you ready?"
33260,toby,I've got nothing to do.
33262,toby," I got to the office at six and it turned out that everything I was supposed  to do got done by seven thirty; some strange fluke of the calendar, so I'm just out  here walking around. You know, just being in the world."
33264,toby,"Yeah. Well, you know, yeah."
33265,c.j.,"Well, I'm gonna change all that. I'd like you to meet with a Russian reporter named  Ludmila Koss, she's the Washington correspondent for the Novaya Gazeta, she wants  credentials and a seat on the press charter."
33267,c.j.,The Russians banned her from the summit.
33269,c.j.,She supported the other guy.
33270,toby,"Aha. Time to teach these Stoli-drinking Tchaikovskys a thing or two about free press  American style! You don't ban those who supported you opponent, you make them wallow  in their losedom by covering your victory. You sit them in the front row. You give  them a hat! I will save Ludmila Koss, for I am Toby, and in doing so... Why am I going  on like this?"
33272,toby,"Set up the meeting. Obviously, I have a little time."
33275,c.j.,"Yeah, Josh made me see him yesterday. He filed everything he was supposed to file."
33276,c.j.,"It's just, you know, it's what it is... "
33280,c.j.,"Come on, Ron, I haven't had a boyfriend in a... I get a lot of hate mail. After the  President, I'm the single most visible person in the Federal government, every day I'm  on TV and every day exactly half the people are going to disagree with you and some of  those people are going to hate you and some of those are gonna write letters."
33283,c.j.,"At my briefing yesterday, I made some remarks about a situation in Saudi Arabia.  I may have gone too far, I was thinking about apologizing."
33302,toby,Toby Ziegler. Come on in.
33303,toby,You write for the Novaya Gazeta.
33304,toby,Your circulation's gotten huge.
33305,toby,"And it's hard to tell whether that's because of your reporting, your editorials, or the  naked women on page three. "
33306,toby,"Touche, madam.  So what did you do to piss off President Chigorin?"
33307,toby,Have you met someone who does?
33308,toby,"No, I... I'm just talking.  Listen, you're already credentialed to cover  our President, it's just a matter of putting you on a plane and, before I do that,  I want to check with the State department to make sure it's not a grotesquely insulting  thing to do to a new President from whom the US is hoping for quite a bit."
33309,toby,"No, it extends farther then that but it only protects us. Believe me, if we were able to  inforce US law around the world, I'd retire and go scuba-diving."
33310,toby,"I've never done it. I've... never done anything, but I've seen pictures and it looks fun.  I've seen pictures of people out there in the world, and they all look like they're glad  they are. Now, granted, when I'm looking at these pictures, somebody's usually trying to  sell me something, but tell you what: I'm 44 years old and I'm buying. I usually don't  talk this much, but I'm having an odd day. Want to stay for a little and look at pictures  of scuba-diving?"
33311,toby," Okay, then. We'll talk tomorrow."
33312,bartlet,Thank you so much. Thank you.
33316,bartlet,There's nothing we can do.
33319,bartlet,"Good morning.  Yeah, we can't do it."
33321,josh,"Well, they confronted the RussiansAtomic Energy Minister with the photographs."
33324,bartlet,That's good enough for me.
33325,josh,He doesn't deny that they're building a reactor; they've had contracts with Iran since  '76 and he says that Deuterium-based reactors had been up and running in Canada for years.
33326,bartlet,"Well, Canada, Russia - roughly the same relationship with the US. Fitz, you old horse  thief, you old muckety-muck!"
33327,bartlet,Josh says the director of MinAtom says it's commercial power production.
33328,bartlet,"Well, that's what was said by my National Security Advisor twenty minutes ago, right after  it was said by the Secretaries of State and Defense. And, for what it's worth, the directors  of the CIA, NSA, FBI and Naval Intelligence."
33329,josh,"Leo, isn't MinAtom in terrible shape?"
33331,josh," Yeah, that's 'welcome to free markets the hard way,' but my point is the light water  reactor contracts are way behind schedule, there are all kinds of technical failures."
33332,bartlet,You think the Iranians forced them to build them a heavy water reactor?
33333,josh,"To satisfy the contracts, maybe."
33334,bartlet,"Crap. And even if that were the case, it doesn't make them Jean Valjean. They want to power  broker in the Middle East. Just what the doctor ordered for the Middle East. "
33335,bartlet,"All right, while avoiding the biggest diplomacy disaster since I don't know when -  Josh, Leo, you guys have to figure out a way to get me out of it."
33338,josh,There's something... really good on television.
33340,josh,"That's why he can't go, there's something really good on television and the President  doesn't know how to work a VCR. "
33341,josh,"Well, it's not that he doesn't know how to work it, they know he's got a staff and  wouldn't buy it. It's... It's that he doesn't trust technology."
33345,josh,"How can you guys, all of you, be so sure it's not MinAtom and the other Cold War  holdouts, the ex-Soviets, walking around... "
33347,josh,"There are other issues on the table! There's NATO expansion, the Caspian pipeline... "
33349,josh,You haven't answered my question.
33351,josh,Chigorin just took office four months ago. How can you be sure it's not a rogue thing?
33353,josh,Yes. How can you be sure?
33355,toby,Thanks for coming down.
33356,toby,"I'm sorry, what did you say?"
33357,toby,"Yeah. I mean, I wanted to talk to you because I'd been asked to put a reporter from  the Novaya Gazeta on the press plane."
33358,toby,"You understand I'm talking about a pencil and pad of paper, from which no one has ever died."
33359,toby,"Well, the editorial judgement aside, what's the damage assessment?"
33360,toby,We make it clear it's not personal.
33361,toby,I don't know... What are the things I can do?
33362,toby,"If the Enquirer asked us, we'd credential them. Making sure the Enquirer can write whatever  it wants is the only way I can be sure the New York Times is writing whatever it wants."
33364,c.j.,"Good morning, Mr. President."
33365,bartlet,"You're gonna get Secret Service protection, but I can't order it unless you sign this  piece of paper, so sign this piece of paper."
33366,c.j.,"Sir, can I ask why you feel it's necessary... "
33367,bartlet,"Because Ron says it is, and around here we do whatever Ron says."
33368,c.j.,"Well, I think it might be an over-reaction."
33369,bartlet,"Good for you. With all your years of training and experience in sniffing out crime,  your opinion really carries a lot of weight with me."
33370,c.j.,I don't want to appear fragile.
33373,bartlet,"We're talking about one bodyguard. I have twelve, and that's before I leave the house.  You ever count the number of guns that come along with me when Abbey and I take in a  play at the Kennedy Center? Do I seem fragile to you?"
33376,c.j.,"You're also not a woman in a man's job. To say nothing of the fact that you're required  by law to be protected by the Treasury Department. You don't have a choice. And frankly,  sir, you and I both know that you score points frequently with the public and with the  press by shrugging off your Secret Service and doing whatever... going to a book store."
33379,bartlet,"I don't care! You're part of my family, and this thing is happening and I simply won't  permit it. Sign the piece of paper."
33381,bartlet,"Let me tell you something! The last time a member of my staff got a death threat, they  missed him and hit me!"
33382,c.j.,"Ron... is there any evidence... any evidence at all that this guy... Look, I work in the  White House, everybody knows that, but is there any evidence to suggest that... "
33383,c.j., Where did you get these?
33384,c.j.,"That's me leaving my house on Monday. This one's at a restaurant where I had dinner  with my niece. This one's from this morning... it was taken from about twenty feet away.  All right, okay. "
33385,c.j.,"Okay. Thank you, Mr. President."
33388,bartlet,"Oh man, the greatest campaign speech ever about money - FDR promises to tighten our belts.  What's he do when he gets here - spends more than we knew could be spent. And it's 'cause  he discovered it's better for long-term growth. "
33389,toby,The journal probably wrote an editorial about his broken promises too.
33390,bartlet,"Hey, I should be able to reference that speech. When did he give that? It was in the  industrial North East."
33392,bartlet,"Charlie, FDR gave a budget speech in 1932 in Pittsburgh, can you get your hands on a copy?"
33393,bartlet,"I said, FDR gave a budget speech in 1932... "
33395,toby,"Thank you, Mr. President."
33404,bartlet," Aaaah, was wilst du von mein Leben? What do you want from my life? The government  can't be in the business of cosigning loans."
33410,bartlet,The marketplace will take care of Antares.
33412,bartlet,That's what's supposed to happen.
33414,bartlet,That was an industry that was hurt by unfair trade practices. Antares was hurt by their  own carelessness.
33416,bartlet,Unless they go under and either way they've just said 'We're open for business.'
33418,bartlet, They were huge contributors! How the hell am I supposed... They were huge contributors! 
33422,bartlet,They're announcing end of business tomorrow?
33424,bartlet," I'm not saying anything, but grab some people and put together some numbers."
33426,bartlet,I'm not saying anything.
33441,toby,"Here are your credentials for the plane, here's your plane ticket, here are your  credentials for the Palace, the Saturday press conference, the Arctic Peoples exhibit,  the Sunday press conference, and the Hall of Flags."
33442,toby,"Either way, I found out why Chigorin and his people have such a problem with you."
33443,toby,"No, it's because you stink."
33444,toby,"You can beg all you want, you're not gonna get it. Last month, you alleged that the  Chigorin government bombed several apartment buildings based on an unattributed source.  It was refuted; you never retracted!"
33445,toby," Last week, you had a cover story about President Chigorin's  mother-in-law moving closer to the Kremlin. You printed her home address, she had to relocate."
33446,toby,"You reported the failing grades of the Defense Minister's twelve-year-old son! Does that  even count as journalism? Does that do anything but bring ridicule on a defenseless kid?  We've got people like you here, on cable and on the Internet, and there's no one anywhere  on the ideological spectrum that doesn't roll their eyes when their names are spoken out  loud. You know, we've always had free press here, we take it for granted... how can you   Anyway. Here are your credentials. "
33451,bartlet,"Anybody? Can I use this to get out of weddings and stuff?  Sam, the Majority  Leader's gonna move up HMO reform and my Duma's gonna vote on it, what do you think?"
33452,josh,"Sorry, sir, would you hear what Sam has to say for a moment?"
33457,bartlet,"'Stem the tide"" is an English idiom."
33459,josh,"Sir, Chigorin wrote that."
33461,bartlet,He is trying to send me a message.
33462,bartlet," We've been trying to get non-proliferation on the agenda, we've been trying  to put those exact words in Chigorin's mouth."
33463,josh,He's got the whole Soviet defense establishment that's trying to do business.
33465,josh,"It's the old diplomatic corps, and he can't trust them yet, sir."
33467,bartlet,Let's go to Helsinki. But the reactor's first thing on the agenda. Anybody?
33469,bartlet,"Thanks, everyone! Thank you. Thanks!"
33471,bartlet,I'll be right in. Sam! 
33475,bartlet,Tell me again why I can't wear whatever the hell I want?
33477,bartlet,I probably won't be wearing them.
33479,bartlet,"Whatever happened to Pong, huh? It was great, it was relaxing, it had that very  satisfying sound?"
33480,bartlet,"Yeah, me neither. Leo? "
33481,bartlet,No. Leo wanted to see if we could guarantee a loan.
33482,bartlet,"I appreciate that, and I can't give it to you, but I think I can do Leo one better."
33484,bartlet,"We'll stay his biggest customer. When you announce your recall, you can announce you're  keeping your government contracts. Leo will work it out with Congress."
33485,bartlet,Talk to me about the 75 thousand workers.
33486,bartlet,"All right. Jakie, this is the White House, if we only screw up twice before breakfast,  it was a very good morning."
33487,bartlet,"One more thing: you can't make any more campaign contributions to me, or any Democrat.  You can vote, but that's it."
33488,bartlet,I knew I'd get screwed by a computer one day. 
33489,bartlet," For the hundredth time, it was an homage!"
33491,bartlet,The White House owes you one picture.
33493,bartlet,"I'm sorry. I'm married to one. No, you meant that as a good thing! Let's go. "
33494,bartlet,"FDR was a fine president, don't get me wrong, but if you want something done right,  dammit, call New Hampshire! Come in, please."
33495,bartlet,"Are you retired, Mr. Tatum?"
33496,bartlet, Your grandfather was a furnace worker. Your father was on a railroad.  You couldn't find an honest work?
33498,bartlet,"Where are you going? You got pictures, what do you I get?"
33499,bartlet,"You were there, you were at his feet, you got to tell me everything! Sit, we're going to  get some food.  You sit quietly over there and try to resist temptation to  bill me for something."
33502,c.j.,"Aha. What branch of the Treasury Department, Agent Donovan?"
33504,c.j.,"Well, first of all, from how far away can you do this?"
33507,c.j.,You can't come in the Briefing Room.
33508,c.j.,This is what you meant by I am the boss?
33509,c.j.,"Well, I guess it's gonna have to be the little things now."
33522,c.j.,"NO! You understand? I'm driving myself home. You want to follow me in a chase car,  that's fine. But you have been annoying me for six days. You annoyed me here for three  days then you annoyed me in Finland. You're quiet, you're polite, and you're, you're  there. You're always there, I can't shake you. You followed me to Scandinavia and back. "
33523,c.j.,"Don't give me the ""aw shucks"" answer, ""Well that's my job, ma'am."" And don't call me  ""ma'am,"" don't call me ""ma'am,"" don't call me ""Ms. Cregg."" This isn't a western."
33524,c.j.,"Okay, okay, secret agent man, here's my rules and regulations. I'm getting in my baby  blue '65 Mustang convertible and I'm gonna feel the wind in my hair and any place else  I want. You can look at my taillights."
33525,c.j.,I will see you at home!
33526,c.j.,"There's no way you're letting me walk out the door, so what is it we're doing?"
33527,c.j.,What's your plan for me?
33528,c.j.,Are you gonna let me drive myself home?
33529,c.j.,You've got my spark plug?
33530,c.j.,Did you leave me anything?
33535,c.j.,What are you talking about?
33546,josh,When did you find you missed me the most?
33552,josh,It should be in my office.
33556,josh,Moose. It's sauna-soaked moose meat. Nicely packaged in a burnt pine box. The hinges  are made from hand-woven Lapland ribbons.
33558,josh,Where am I supposed to be right now?
33560,c.j.,"No ""paid for by"" tagline."
33561,toby,We've looked at it three times now.
33564,toby,Do we make up a counter or do we keep it in a drawer?
33566,josh,I saw it last night. I'm gonna talk to Counsel's office.
33567,josh,If this was stolen I don't want Sam to end up like the girlfriend of an indicted Senator.
33568,c.j.,Do you have any reason to believe it was stolen?
33570,c.j.,How can he be an accomplice to a crime he had no reason to believe occurred?
33574,toby,"More than likely it's multi-jurisdictional, the thing probably crossed state lines."
33579,josh,What are you suggesting?
33591,c.j.,Good. Good. I accidentally ate a moose.
33593,toby,"Listen, I've got an idea for a new kind of awards show, you should tell your entertainment  divisions about this. At the moment the winner's name is called the four nominees who  didn't win drop through a trap door right under their seats. Am I crazy, or is that not  pretty good television?"
33594,toby,"Yes, I've been asked by Bruno Gianelli to apologize for the skyboxes in Miami. We'll do  better at the Garden."
33595,toby,"We've got a better surrogate program this time. Governors, some of the big mayors,  some of us will be available to you, and some of us still have to staff the president."
33598,toby,And we have to call it programming?
33599,toby,The panels were a little dry last time.
33600,toby,"Monday night we've got real people. The president's met across the country reading  planks from the platform. Scott O'Leary's doing the keynote. The Harlem Boys' Choir  is singing the National Anthem. Tuesday is Mrs. Bartlet and Rev. Lydell. We've got a  panel with women senators on biomedical research, breast cancer breakthroughs, medical  privacy issues... Look, uh, a Dean Martin roast it ain't, but..."
33601,toby,You only covered two hours a night last time. How much more can you...?
33602,toby," You can't do an hour a night, that's just..."
33603,toby,One of these times you guys are going to come in here and say that and it's going to be true.
33605,bartlet,"Four or five hours, maybe, you'll be fine."
33607,bartlet,"They take all the Henrys. They do a thing, they call it War of the Roses. I'm told by  those who saw it in London it's spectacular. Catholic charities bought out a Broadway  theater. We're gonna go, we're gonna make some money."
33609,bartlet,You know why? Cause the Royal National Company's got all the King Henrys up there and  I'm still number one at the box office.
33611,bartlet,"Let me as you something, which Plantagenet do I most remind you of?"
33614,bartlet,We just got done with Helsinki and the reactor.
33618,bartlet,"So order it. I don't care if we know anything new or not, I need updates every half  hour for the next 48 hours."
33619,toby,"Look this is obviously a--do not eat the fruit--this is obviously a, a negotiating  position for you, so what is it you need? You want us to vote a member of the Rules  Committee out of the convention every night or something? The secretary should eat  a jellyfish? "
33621,c.j.,That code name's not going anywhere is it?
33622,c.j.,I'm going shopping at lunch.
33624,c.j.,I'm taking my niece Hogan shopping for a dress for her Junior Prom.
33625,c.j.,You're not gonna say that Hogan's a strange name for a girl?
33626,c.j.,My older brothers are golf crazies.
33627,c.j.,"Anything else, Agent Sunshine?"
33628,c.j.,Plus you're not my valet.
33629,c.j.,Bernie's on Connecticut at 12:30.
33633,c.j.,"That was I strange thing I just did. I was telling him that I was taking Hogan shopping  for a Junior Prom dress, a few moments later he referred to the Prom and I made a point  of correcting him. Why would I do that, I felt so unnatural while I was saying it."
33634,c.j., I'd say that was ridiculous but I also referred to my older brothers.
33635,c.j.,Yeah but isn't that the kind of thing you do when you meet a guy and you're... 
33636,c.j.,"Never mind, it was obviously some kind of left-brain hip check, I'll take care of it."
33637,c.j.,"Yes, talk to me about them."
33641,josh,What're you talking about?
33642,josh,"I- yeah, I gave it to- "
33643,josh,"Nobody. Sorry, Martha, I'll, I'll take care of it."
33650,josh,Did you try the moose meat?
33652,josh,It's up to $180 on E-bay.
33654,josh,I... I... I don't understand; I don't need to tell you that you can't sell...
33680,bartlet,"It's Henry V, three Henry VI, and Henry VIII. "
33681,bartlet,What does that mean? It sounds modern.
33682,bartlet,"Well, that doesn't sound bad."
33683,bartlet,Let me ask you something.
33684,bartlet,"If Shakespeare wrote a play about me, how many parts do you think it would be?"
33690,bartlet,We're leaning on Arab Intelligence sources?
33694,bartlet,I'm not going to the bunker.
33696,bartlet,I'm not going to the bunker. It sends a terrible sign. I'm sitting in this room.
33698,bartlet,You haven't been through it with me.
33700,bartlet,"You're telling me that the Secret Service, you're telling me my own bodyguards are  gonna escort me to the bunker?"
33702,c.j.,"I know you said you didn't want taffeta, but what do you think?"
33705,c.j.,"But I'm the cool aunt, this is what I do. Look at this.  Good gracious.  Black silk couture gown."
33706,c.j.,As luck would have it that's my height exactly.
33707,c.j.,Thank you. I'm just going to take this one too. 
33709,c.j.,Is Simon bothering you?
33710,c.j.,"If he is, if he ever does, I want you to shriek at the top of your lungs, okay?"
33741,josh,And this is the White House not Williams-Sonoma.
33743,josh,He can't do it this way.
33751,josh,I said all right like five minutes ago.
33759,toby,How about corporate sponsorship?
33760,toby,Why are people footing the bill for this anyway?
33761,toby,It's better than four nights of professional wrestling.
33770,toby,Wait a second. How is it possible that these four people got together and decided something?  I mean how is it possible that they got together and agreed?
33772,toby,Get me David Wolczek at the Justice Department.
33775,bartlet,This doesn't mean anything to me.
33778,bartlet,Are we able to take a guess at where and when now?
33779,bartlet, What about Abdul Shareef? Isn't Shareef supposed to be helping us with intelligence  out of Qumar?
33782,bartlet,"I'm not going to the bunker. There are going to be people who aren't going to the bunker,  and when I get out I'm not going to be able to tell them what to do anymore and I like  doing that. Let's get Abby to New Hampshire but I'm not going to the bunker. And if you  say I have to I'm walking across the alley with the Chief Justice and I'm handing John  Hoynes my resignation. And as soon as he's sworn in I'm telling him to appoint me his  Vice President because I'm not going to the bunker. If the agent's come, the agents come  but tell Ron he'd better bring more than a couple of guys."
33794,c.j.,This. Sam's encouraging the President to sign the Clean Campaign pledge.
33795,c.j.,And they talk about the tape.
33797,toby,Yeah. You broadcast all four nights of the convention.
33798,toby,"'Cause the public owns the airwaves not you, and you have a legal obligation to the public."
33799,toby,You have an FCC public obligation.
33801,toby,'Cause if you don't the Justice Department is going to investigate you for anti-trust violation.
33802,toby,A joint decision not to compete for the best convention programming.
33803,toby,"Not me so much as the Justice Department. 15 U.S.C. section 1. ""Every contract combination  or conspiracy in restraint of trade or commerce is declared to be illegal. Every person who  shall engage in any combination..."""
33804,toby,"Yes, no. There isn't going to be a horse race to cover, either in New York or San Diego,  but we gave you the air waves for free 70 years ago and 357 days a year you can say who's  up and who's down, who won the West and who lost the South but what's wrong with 8 days,  not every year but every 4 years, showing our leaders talking to us. Not a fraction of  what they said but what they said. And then th-the balloons."
33805,toby,You have to talk to the lawyers.
33826,bartlet,What did they find on board?
33829,bartlet,That wasn't on the list.
33832,bartlet,The Golden Gate Bridge.
33833,bartlet,This was on the west coast and we didn't know anything.
33835,bartlet,I'm going to ask this again. Where the hell was Shareef?
33840,bartlet,Are you telling me the Qumari defence minister may have ordered an attack on the  Golden Gate Bridge?
33841,bartlet,We have a diplomatic relationship with this country.
33842,bartlet,"He's coming here. Shareef is coming here, in like, ten days, isn't he?"
33845,c.j.,Hey Jamie. Could you give us just a second?
33847,c.j.,What were you and Hogan talking about that you would tell me later?
33848,c.j.,Oh. I didn't know that.
33850,c.j.,"I just said ""thank you""."
33851,c.j.,"Well, I should get going."
33857,bartlet,We want to ask the Justice Department to indict Qumari Minister of Defense. We’re saying  he’s a terror kingpin. We’re saying he’s killed I don’t know how many civilians and how  many of Tommy’s Marines. We’re saying he’s compromised I don’t know how many agents  throughout the world and we’re saying he’s done it in the clothing of an ally. This isn’t  a cave dweller. This is Capone. You haven’t got it. 
33858,josh," I don’t know, it’s confusing. There’s Van Morrison. She’s doing a scene from  “Flashdance.” "
33861,josh,"Listen, I’m sending you to Bismarck, okay? You got to go tomorrow and sit in on a DNC  platform meeting where they’re discussing whether or not... "
33868,josh," I wouldn’t go that far, you’re speaking for the White House.  The DNC’s having a platform meeting and North Dakota wants to have a plank eliminating  the word ‘north’ from their name. We take no state for granted; we want to show North  Dakota we care and so the White House is going to be represented... "
33870,josh, It’s really the very most we’re willing to do. I’ll write a  statement and you’ll read it. 
33875,josh,I forgot I had that meeting. 
33877,josh,"The Iditarod, Donna. They have an airport; it’s the capital. "
33879,josh,As soon as I get dressed. 
33881,josh,Buttercup? You getting enough iron in your diet? You getting too much? 
33882,josh,Quite a bit of Sunday with your man. 
33883,josh,I have to meet with Rick Pintero. We set it up yesterday. It’s about reauthorization  of the Welfare Reform Bill.  
33884,josh,And I’m pretty broken up about that. But this is right in your wheelhouse. Poor women  are counting on me. 
33885,josh,I bought your birthday present already.  
33902,josh,"I’m sorry, I had in my head that we were doing this in your office. "
33903,josh,My assistant set me straight. Come on back. 
33906,josh,It’s a city. You’ve been there. 
33908,josh,Ah... I just... we’ve been scheduled for a while to go to a Catholic charity’s fundraiser  in New York next week. It’s the Royal National Company... 
33909,josh," And it’s great, but I’ve just been told Governor Ritchie is coming as well,  so now it becomes a different thing, and... "
33910,josh, Yeah. But what do you got? 
33912,josh,We can’t cave on childcare. 
33915,josh," Well, the work requirement aside, the marriage incentives... "
33916,josh,Marriage incentives are terrible! 
33917,josh," All right, let me talk about it around here. "
33918,josh,"Yeah, I’m really looking forward to it. Thanks."
33920,bartlet," I’ve been seeing a shrink, by the way. I had trouble sleeping and Leo  brought in a guy. I feel ridiculous talking out loud like this, but he said... Doesn’t  matter. I just can’t believe it’s been a year. Anyway. "
33927,bartlet,“The enemy imagines he is secure. The bridge did not fall. He looks down from  his high-- or elevated place or places-- but our great victory is still assured.  There will be other moments. 
33929,bartlet,"“I have brought him low, and I will do it again.”  All right. "
33930,toby,"They can't be in the same room. It elevates him, it diminishes us."
33932,toby,Now he's one of two guys tossing a job application.
33933,c.j.,And it gives him access to a massive press corps.
33934,josh,"How do we get out? We'll look impolite, and we'll look chicken."
33935,josh,"We'll tell him the shows not very good, we don't think he's going to like it."
33936,c.j.,"Yes, yes, that's what we do."
33937,josh,"We don't go, we pull out. Better to look chicken, then to get broasted, my mother always says."
33939,josh,I've never really known but it's what they do to chickens.
33942,toby,"You think we don't go, right?"
33944,toby,"All right, we don't go. The President's going to have to call the Archbishop."
33945,c.j.,I was looking forward to it.
33948,josh,It's five hours of King Henry's with musical interludes and a dinner break.
33949,c.j.,I think you should come to my house and perform it for me.
33953,toby,I talked to Jane and Muriel this morning and they said they came to you yesterday with  something about the Everglades and you shut the door.
33955,toby,They seemed pretty excited about it. You sure you don't want it?
33959,bartlet,This is ridiculous. He's coming here. He's coming here! Why the hell can't we arrest him  when he steps off the plane?
33960,bartlet,Fitz makes a reasonable point. Doesn't it pretty much go without saying that I revoked  it after he tried to blow up the Golden Gate Bridge?
33962,bartlet,Why the hell do we need...? He's coming here on his own. He's delivering himself on  a Lear jet.
33965,bartlet,"Fellas, this guy is going to stand trial in a US court and if we have to stick heroin on  his plane to get him there, that's what we're going to do. "
33967,c.j.,"I want you to tell me right now, this second, what are you people doing to catch this guy?"
33968,c.j.,"You know, I haven't been happy with any of your answers to any of my questions."
33970,c.j.,He's been reading my e-mail?
33971,c.j.,He knew I was shopping?
33973,c.j.,I don't want to know about this.
33975,c.j.,So the one time you answer a question of mine...
33977,c.j.,"I thought you said you want to have ""gin"" tonight."
33978,c.j.,I can't go to my gym tonight. My gym's flooded.
33981,c.j.,You don't have to get snobby about it.
33983,bartlet,It should be a showcase. He should have the best lawyers in the world.
33991,bartlet,You suppose that could be any more patronizingly named?
33993,bartlet,What do they want me to eat?
33995,bartlet,"Ah, the marriage incentives. What a bunch of horse manure."
33997,bartlet,Is marriage really something that should be incentivised? And where the hell are all  the small government conservatives when we're talking about Washington getting into the  yenta business?
33999,bartlet,You think we should do it?
34001,bartlet,Marriage incentives. Used to be all you had to have was a decent dental practice.
34008,bartlet,I appreciated you coming out to the cemetery with me yesterday.
34009,bartlet,"So it's been a year. Why don't you organize the search, you know for a new Executive Secretary."
34010,bartlet,I may not like the first couple of candidates. It may take a while.
34016,josh,Hey.  Something smells great.
34017,josh,It's ready? We can eat it?
34023,josh,"Oh, this is going to be a good night. My woman, a fine stew, and a Mets game on national TV.  You see how I slipped that last one in?"
34024,josh,You listening to Van Morrison again?
34026,josh,"Yeah, in fact we're getting another billion for childcare."
34027,josh,300 million for marriage incentives.
34028,josh,"No, the marriage incentives are a serious..."
34030,josh,"You know what? Every single study, every one shows that kids do better in two-parent houses."
34032,josh,"Amy, if we don't get elected, I promise you, President Ritchie is going to have a lot  less sympathy for your agenda."
34033,josh,Yes it is. It's locked up. I have the American Children’s Alliance behind it.
34034,josh,And we're back to work.
34035,josh,"Yeah, it's Josh. The Secretary of Labor is in Chicago..."
34044,c.j.,You guys have a shooting range here?
34046,c.j., Let me try one of those.
34048,c.j.,"Yeah, let me see what all the fuss is about."
34050,c.j.,"Well, I haven't shot one as much as I've seen others shot one in the movies."
34051,c.j.,You guys use bull's-eyes?
34052,c.j.,I thought you'd use those little outlines of people.
34053,c.j.,'Cause I'm thinking if someone's coming or you they probably don't have a bulls-eye on them.
34054,c.j.,Tough talk. I like that. Give me your gun.
34055,c.j.,What's wrong with yours?
34056,c.j.,I've heard of that. That's a good brand.
34057,c.j.,Let's go. I'm feeling twitchy.
34059,c.j.,I don't need training wheels.
34060,c.j.,That thing practically broke my arm. I've been wrong about guns. Just hand these out  to the criminals.
34063,c.j.,"Show me what you've got. I'll tell you what. I'll make it interesting for you. Get five  bullets. If you can't land any in the middle, then I get to drive my car."
34064,c.j.,"Come on. One dead center, I never bother you about it again."
34069,c.j.,Wait. That was a trick. You must know you can do it. Put three in the middle.
34070,c.j.,Three out of five. You want to back out?
34071,c.j.,"Look, if you want to back out..."
34072,c.j.,Wow. That's what I call dead center. What happen to the other two bullets?
34073,c.j.,"There were five bullets, and I don't believe it."
34074,c.j.,How do you shoot like that?
34076,c.j.,Yes. Yes. I like that you're tall.
34077,c.j.,It makes me feel more feminine. I'm going to go change.
34089,josh,We're actually here separately. This is a coincidence.
34091,josh,We have to move faster on the welfare bill.
34093,josh,"We are fine, but the women's groups will have their day in the sun."
34095,josh,One particular women's group for sure.
34099,josh,Not at all. I'm just saying...
34103,josh,We're not going to lose the floor vote.
34105,toby,The President needs to call the Archbishop and tell him we can't be at the fund-raiser.
34109,josh,"That's exactly what we do. No, it takes care... We get the leadership to schedule the  welfare vote for next week on the day we're supposed to be in New York. We can't go  'cause we got to work the vote and the early vote gives Amy no time to mobilize."
34113,toby,Sam doesn't need to be patronized. He'll shake it off.
34115,toby,I don't want him feeling better. I want him feeling mad. Is there anyone you'd rather have  as a blood enemy less then Sam? That's how I want him.
34117,bartlet, They've got something for us.
34124,bartlet,"Well, I'm no lawyer, but I'm pretty sure that's inadmissible."
34125,bartlet,"We'll come up with a less aggressive way of... We'll cancel his trip here obviously,  but we'll come up with something. That's the ball game."
34138,josh,They're getting telegrams two to one against. I just met with two Congressmen. Amy got in  going in 24 hours.
34140,josh,Yeah. I'm not talking about just a couple either.
34160,toby,Can I get the room for a minute?
34162,toby,"The first election I ever worked, you know was Bronx Borough President. There was some  questions about my guys tax returns, so we called a press conference. It was 104 degrees  that day on Bronx Boulevard. And I thought with a tax thing, the shorter the better, so  I turned off the air-conditioning."
34164,toby,Not the press so much as the candidate fainted.
34166,toby,"Yeah. I don't even think I ended up voting for him. Now, you screw up was worse and on a  much bigger stage."
34168,toby,Yeah. 'Cause this is no time for the starters to be on the bench.
34171,toby,"I read the Everglades pitch from Muriel and Jane. You're right, it's probably a pass."
34173,toby,I think anything tactical makes us look bad.
34180,toby,"You're still mad, right?"
34182,josh,It's unknown. That's why it's called an X-factor.
34185,bartlet,"Josh, what the hell did you do to this welfare vote?"
34186,josh,"Well, we scheduled it for Wednesday night."
34188,josh,"Two reasons, sir. The first was to get you out of the Catholic Charities event in New York."
34190,josh,Governor Ritchie's accepted an invitation.
34192,bartlet,The fund-raiser was my idea. I've known the Archbishop for 20 years and I'm not playing  politics with the church. Did anyone want to ask me abut this? You've got me running the  vote from the mezzanine floor of a Broadway theatre. Where are we in the vote?
34193,josh,"Well, to be honest, we're slipping a little bit."
34197,josh,The women's groups are raising...
34198,bartlet," True or false, Josh: My life would be better right now if you and your  girlfriend swapped jobs? Why is it for every good thing you do around here, we've got  to endure three screwiest."
34199,josh,"Well, I'm sorry about the..."
34200,bartlet,Sorry doesn't get me 218. It doesn't get back the ad that slipped through your office  any more then it gets back tobacco which you gave away for lunch money. And why the hell  don't you know what Ritchie's commitments are before you get anywhere near my schedule?  I've got the Presidential Box at a cattle call. Win the damn vote.
34202,bartlet,I've got a G-8 briefing.
34203,josh,"Thank you, Mr. President."
34204,c.j.,That was a fun party. I'd wish you'd come inside.
34206,c.j.,"You're not big on fun, are you?"
34208,c.j.,Walking on the wrong side of you.
34209,c.j., We couldn't just be two people who are walking home at the end of the night?
34210,c.j.,You know you told me a few days ago that you were at Rosslyn and I never said anything.  I should have said something.
34211,c.j.,"What was your, um, what was your job right then?"
34213,c.j.,Which one was Beckwith? I get them mixed up.
34215,c.j.,I just like your smile is all. I wouldn't mind seeing it more.
34217,c.j.,"I was just, you're right, 'cause walking in these heels..."
34218,c.j.,Aren't you supposed to be walking in front of me?
34219,c.j.,We feel free to take chances.
34222,c.j.,"I say can we drop it, you say sure and then we don't drop it."
34224,josh,It's got to costing you an awful lot of PAC money.
34225,josh,It's after midnight; they wouldn't let me up.
34226,josh,"Yes, you are. You know for every vote on the left you grab, I got to get one on the right.  You know what that does to the bill?"
34227,josh,I've seen you level hotel ballrooms screaming about how ridiculous abstinence is.
34228,josh,"Amy, when these things are over and we win, you know who's job it is to pay a visit to  the people who weren't with us?"
34230,josh,I'm saying that just 'cause you have Sherry Lansing's platinum card doesn't mean you  go toe-to toe with the people...
34231,josh,...who are writing the federal budget when they need you.
34232,josh,There's a bigger picture. There's an election in November and you are a player in a  political party.
34234,josh,I have to go back to the office. 
34237,bartlet,What are you doing here? It's 1:00 in the morning.
34241,bartlet,You came over here to stand in front of Josh?
34249,bartlet,More counsel is going to help me violate international law.
34251,bartlet,It's pretty easy to say anything is a war scenario.
34253,bartlet,The war on poverty. It's a slippery slope.
34257,bartlet,There are moral absolutes.
34259,bartlet,Il Principe has justified every act of oppression...
34263,bartlet,"Well, a mob mentality is just..."
34265,bartlet,There are moral absolutes. Make the call.
34267,c.j.,"We're leaving exactly one hour later than we planned. At 5:00, he'll board Marine One for  the trip to Andrews, where he'll board Air Force One for the trip to New York. We're just  trying to be helpful because we understand that a Presidential motorcade rolling through  midtown Manhattan around 6:00, 6:30 really helps keep things well-lubed out there. As a  matter of fact, we apologize to New Yorkers for the inconvenience, but the delay was  inevitable."
34268,c.j.,I meant to say 'unavoidable.' The delay was unavoidable. The President will make a short  visit at City Hall and be in his feet at 7:30.
34269,c.j.,The play is 19 hours long.
34270,c.j.,It's long. It's five and a half hours.
34272,c.j.,"Yeah, there's movement. It's close."
34273,c.j.,Look at the color of Josh Lyman's hair.
34274,c.j.,I'd go beyond that. I'd say the future of the entire world depends on it.
34275,c.j.,"I don't want to scare anybody, but I'd call your Congressman. Mark?"
34276,c.j.,The President and Governor Ritchie?
34278,c.j.,Anything else? I'll see you in New York.
34280,c.j.,He scheduled a last-minute meeting.
34282,c.j.,Qumari Defense Minister Abdul Shareef.
34290,bartlet,There are rules for these things?
34291,bartlet,Doesn't the law also require that I not assassinate someone?
34292,bartlet,I know. One of them was mine.
34294,bartlet,Assume for a second I say yes. How do we do it? Fitz walks up to him with a gun?
34296,bartlet,The things we choose to care about.
34297,bartlet,"If it can't happen here, then why'd we care that Shareef was delivering himself?"
34299,bartlet,How many over there know about this?
34300,bartlet,And some people in Bermuda?
34302,bartlet," Okay. Well... surely, this is the most absurd meeting I ever sat in, and  friends, that is saying something."
34304,bartlet,What does the pen do? Squirts poison?
34305,bartlet,We give him it boxed. Tell them to put it in a box.
34307,josh,That doesn't give you cancer?
34309,josh,Welfare is a core issue with swing and independent voters. They use it as a barometer to  measure a President's values on work and responsibility.
34310,josh,We're gonna win the vote.
34311,josh,We will... but we're gonna. I have a nine-point margin.
34313,josh,You understand we have to authorize welfare one way or another. You got to do it every  six years.
34315,josh,You have an extra billion in child care.
34316,josh,"We don't like the marriage incentives, either. Don't be ridiculous, but independent  voters..."
34317,josh,"Call off the hunt, and I'll see to it that you guys can make up with The White House."
34318,josh,'Cause we're gonna win.
34320,c.j.,I thought you weren't on 'til this afternoon.
34322,c.j.,"Sure, it is.  You should be like that."
34323,c.j.,Could you set this gentleman up with a keychain?
34324,c.j.,"It'll have the Seal of the President on it, and President Bartlet's signature, and you  can tell your mom that you can't buy this in a souvenir shop. In fact, you can't buy it  anywhere 'cause it's against the law to sell the Seal of the President. You can only get  it here."
34325,c.j.,"If the cops stopped you, they're gonna think you're an important person."
34329,c.j.,Listen. I was thinking there's really no reason for you to make the trip to New York.
34330,c.j.,I'm gonna be traveling with the President the whole time.
34332,c.j.,Who's trying to date you?
34333,c.j.,Who's trying to kiss you?
34335,c.j.,Aren't you not allowed to call a protectee by their first name?
34336,c.j.,There's really no reason for you to come to New York.
34337,bartlet,"It's ""The War of the Roses."" All the Henrys, and all the Richards, for that matter."
34339,bartlet,Yeah. There's also singing.
34340,bartlet,"No, but they're gonna sing from time to time, and one of the songs is a song I love.  I can't think of the name now, but it's an Edwardian... It always reminds me... It makes  me think of college, like, I don't know, like they should be singing it in the dining  hall at Christ College at Cambridge. The chorus is, ""And victorious in war shall be made  glorious in peace."" I was just singing it this morning."
34341,bartlet,"Good. Yeah. Let me ask you something. Is there a crime, which if it wasn't illegal, you  would do?"
34342,bartlet,"Right, but you wouldn't rob a bank?"
34343,bartlet,"Connecticut had a law prohibiting the use of contraceptives. It was written out of rage  against adultery. But in the age of AIDS, don't Connecticut residents do more for the  general welfare by flagrantly breaking the law?"
34347,bartlet,"No, I really can't. It's high security. To say nothing of... "
34348,bartlet,"If I tell you I intend to commit a crime, you're required by law to report it.  I'm gonna go. It's good seeing you."
34351,toby,"I don't think the congressman is here as a co-sponsor of the bill, Sam. I think he's here  as the leader of Florida's Republican Delegation."
34354,toby,"It's a Catholic fundraiser, Ted. It's not a network debate."
34356,toby,"Ted, the President enters the room with his wife and the President of China. He doesn't  do it with the governor of Florida."
34357,josh,It was a scheduling error.
34360,josh,We can help you raise money.
34361,josh,"Look, there's a billion more for child care. This isn't a bad bill. We're fixing ten  things..."
34362,josh,...that were wrong with welfare. Transportation subsidies...
34363,josh," All right. These are three 'no' votes, right?"
34364,josh, Okay. The President's gonna call you.
34365,josh, No. Sometime during the first intermission.
34368,bartlet,"Yeah, I'm feeling particularly proud of that today."
34369,bartlet,"We're happy you visited us, Mr. Defense Minister. You're welcome here anytime, and please,  send the best regards of the President of the United States to the Royal Sultan."
34370,bartlet,Not in the Oval Office.
34371,bartlet,Tell him I have a rash on my hand. Make sure you apologize.
34373,bartlet,It's a hand-carved incense burner. Gypsum and sandalwood.
34375,toby,"A.P. called with a quote from Kevin Kahn.  ""Governor Ritchie is looking  forward to meeting with the President tonight so he could talk about the Federal Government's  plan for the Everglades, which would tax sugar farmers into unemployment."""
34377,toby,"Yeah, but now he's got another ""What's Bartlet hiding from us today?"" spot."
34379,toby,...that's being hung up by the Florida delegation.
34382,toby,"In response to a tactical leak from Kevin Kahn, I'm gonna let A.P. know that Florida's messing  with the welfare vote. You all right with that?"
34384,toby,I'm asking 'cause if we lose the vote then we've just said that he's the one that brought  us down.
34386,toby,You all right with this?
34389,bartlet," I saw your resume, so we don't need to talk about that. What have you  been doing recently?"
34391,bartlet,Uh-huh. And before that?
34392,bartlet,You're a professional gambler.
34394,bartlet,Okay. Why did you leave the White House?
34397,bartlet, Would you mind waiting outside just a moment?
34398,bartlet," Is this a joke? If it's a joke, it's both funny and well-executed, but I think  you and I both know that it's not. I send you out to replace Delores Landingham, and that's  what you came home with?"
34399,bartlet,She was an alpaca farmer who needed two tries to get her own name.
34400,bartlet,Don't worry about it. I'm gonna get the Personnel Office on it. I got to go change for  New York.
34409,c.j.,I wanted to get some air.
34411,c.j.,I'm standing in the middle of the President's security detail. What do you think's gonna  happen to me?
34412,c.j.,Maybe if we didn't shout so much.
34413,c.j.,"Oh, I'm sorry you feel that way. I think I've been a treat."
34414,c.j.,You seem a little riled.
34415,c.j.,"I don't think any of it's your fault, and I appreciate everything you've done."
34418,c.j.,So did I. I tried to kiss you.
34419,c.j.,"I was lying, you idiot."
34420,c.j.,I was embarrassed. I fumbled it.
34421,c.j.,It sounded like an excuse.
34422,c.j.,You watched me at Barney's?
34423,c.j., What in God's name are you talking about?
34424,c.j.,"You're saying I need to take my protection more seriously? 'Cause Simon, this is happening  to me. I think I take the situation plenty seriously, but I have to live my life, so maybe..."
34425,c.j.,I shouldn't be talking.
34435,c.j.,Can you meet me after the play?
34442,toby,He's at the Yankee game right now?
34444,toby,I've been to 441 baseball games in Yankee Stadium. There's not a single person there who's  ordinary.
34446,toby,You making fun of the Yankees?
34450,toby,They went to the Yankee game.
34452,toby,"Well, I'm not sure that suits me."
34454,toby,Making an entrance after the President. That's just not how we play bridge. It's not how  we say cricket.
34456,toby,Just talk to me a minute.
34458,toby,"It's a good game. About 40,000 probably."
34460,toby,I am so... proud of you.
34465,toby,"Listen, I'm gonna send the motorcade up to Major Deegan. Is that okay with you?"
34467,toby, Josh has a good point. We should think of a reason.
34468,josh,Why don't you guys get back to me?
34470,josh,They'll start voting in about half an hour.
34471,toby,You bringing in Brenda?
34474,josh,"Yeah, we're bringing in Brenda. We're gonna make her Chairman of the Platform Committee."
34475,toby,"Hey, did I put too much pressure on you with the vote?"
34477,toby,With the Ritchie meeting and the A.P. quote?
34479,toby,And I understand the President jumped up and down on you pretty hard last week.
34480,josh,"It's over, Toby. We won."
34481,toby,"Amy's incredibly employable, Josh."
34487,josh,"No, she'll lose it for sure. Anyway, good job.  See you tomorrow."
34490,toby,He should have take the Cross Bronx to the West Side.
34492,toby,And the Yankees are about to snap a 12-game winning streak. Thanks a lot.
34498,bartlet,"Are you pledging a fraternity or something, 'cause this would be a good one."
34499,bartlet,What's with you and this woman?
34500,c.j.,Somebody's made a mistake. He was just on his way to the field office...
34502,josh,What'd you think I was gonna do?
34506,josh,I'm not a dating service.
34507,josh,"Every serious Democrat is gonna unite behind this President, and I'm not kidding around."
34508,josh,Yeah? How's it going so far?
34509,josh,That's what's scaring the hell out of me.
34510,josh,You can't win the White House while the middle class thinks you disdain work and responsibility.
34511,josh,That's not what we did.
34512,josh,Do you not consider it relevant that it would be worse with Rob Ritchie in the White House?  Why is that not part of the equation?
34515,bartlet,"They're gonna find out it's us. We could make it look like the plane went down, but they're  gonna find out it's us, and I'm gonna be running for reelection while I'm fighting a war  against Qumar."
34523,bartlet,What do you want from me?
34525,bartlet,This isn't a matter of religion.
34527,bartlet,I recognize that there's evil in the world.
34529,bartlet,Doesn't this mean we join the league of ordinary nations?
34531,bartlet,That's not my objection.
34533,bartlet,It's just wrong. It's absolutely wrong.
34541,bartlet,"Yeah, I know. Listen, politics aside, and I don't want to make a big deal out of it, but  you probably insulted the church, and you can head it off at the pass if you speak to the  Cardinal tonight."
34543,bartlet,"Yeah.  No, I don't understand that. The center fielder for the Yankees is an accomplished  classical guitarist. People who like baseball can't like books?"
34544,bartlet,No. Something horrible happened about an hour ago.
34545,bartlet,"C.J. Cregg was getting threats so we put an agent on her. He's a good guy. He was on my  detail for a while, and he was in Rosslyn. He walked in the middle of an armed robbery,  and was shot and killed after detaining one of the suspects."
34546,bartlet," We should have a great debate, Rob. We owe it to everyone. When I was running as a  governor, I didn't know anything. I made them start Bartlet college in my dining room.  Two hours every morning on foreign affairs and the military. You can do that."
34547,bartlet,"I wasn't, Rob. But you've turned being un-engaged into a Zen-like thing, and you shouldn't  enjoy it so much is all, and if it appears at times as if I don't like you, that's the  reason why."
34548,bartlet,They're playing my song.
34549,bartlet,"In the future, if you're wondering, ""Crime. Boy, I don't know"" is when I decided to kick  your ass."
34550,bartlet,You know the story about...
34551,bartlet,"There's a guy down here holding a sign that says, ""Eight more years."" Don't get me wrong,  I like your thinking, but I've probably tested the Constitution about as far as Abbey's  going to allow me to for a little while.  We need to find energy alternatives. We're getting  our cue. We're getting it right now. The Republicans are busy. They're trying to convince  us that they care about new energy and that they're not in the vest pockets of big oil,  and that's a tough sell. I don't envy them, 'cause their only hope is that we don't notice  that they're the ones who are filling the hole with water every night, and I think Americans  are smarter then that. I think we noticed. "
34552,c.j.,Where are Josh and Toby?
34556,c.j.,"He's wrapping up, and we're getting right in the car. We're already late for Unionville."
34559,bartlet,"This isn't a time for people whose doomsday scenario is a little less at the pump for Texaco  and Shell. This isn't a time for people who say there aren't any energy alternatives, just  because they can't think of any. This is a time for American heros, and we reach for the stars."
34561,josh,Because the President's speaking.
34565,josh,"The President has his blood pressure taken every morning. On higher blood pressure days,  Toby's not allowed to be in the President's sight line while he's speaking."
34567,josh,He has trouble concealing his displeasure.
34568,toby,"Stepped on it and he knows it, too."
34569,josh,What do I say to people who ask why we subsidize farmers when we don't subsidize plumbers?
34572,toby,"We worked with the Confernce Committee to increase payment limits for small farmers and  we'd have done it too, but no one could agree what ""small"" meant."
34574,josh,I think we better head back.
34576,toby,"No, we're just talking."
34578,josh,"Donna's a little nervous. A couple of weeks ago, some guys got left behind by the motorcade  in Kentucky."
34581,josh,"I think the real point is, whatever Toby and the Conference Committee... Whatever definition they  came up with would've just created more business for the lawyers for the big farm corporations.  I wished we could've had more time to talk, but..."
34582,josh,"Nah, we've got one more stump in Unionville, and then we get on the plane. It's a full schedule  at the office."
34584,toby,They're voting for Ritchie.
34585,toby,"Indiana's voting for Ritchie. If there was someone less competent than Ritchie on the ballot,  that's who Indiana'd be voting for."
34586,toby,"When somebody can give me an answer to that question, I'll let you know."
34587,josh,We paid farmers $67 billion over the last three years.
34588,josh, You want to lighten up a little?
34589,toby,I am lightened up. This is me lightened up. You're saying lighter?
34593,josh,No... she's right. Where is it?
34595,josh,"Where's the motorcade. Hey, excuse me. Where's the motorcade?"
34597,josh,"All right, Donna, listen, we got to get the trailer car."
34599,josh,Call Campaign Scheduling and Advance and tell them...
34601,josh,You got to hang up with whoever you're tallking to. Call Campaign Sceduling and Advance...  Unless you're already talking to Campaign Scheduling and Advance.
34605,josh,"Good budget cut. Good item. Cathy, where's the closets cab?"
34609,josh,"Okay, this car... it can..."
34611,josh,Thank you very much. Who's Cap?
34617,toby,You heard the speech right?
34618,toby,"The section on HMO's, did he land it?"
34664,bartlet,"Captain, good to see you."
34669,c.j.," Gehrman-Driscoll announced before the bell it was filling for bankruptcy;  an hour later, Jennings-Pratt and DWA."
34670,bartlet,They had exposure in the fund?
34672,bartlet,I'm amazed it's only down 270.
34674,bartlet,That's what you want to say to me?
34675,bartlet,"Driscoll announced it was filling, and Jennings and DWA were in the fund."
34676,bartlet,It's against the law to campaign on a military base.
34678,bartlet,These army guys are DRF-1. They're division ready. They can be deployed in two hours.  These navy guys are going to deploy overseas for six months.
34679,bartlet,"C- bag and M-16, they're on a C-130 going where ever I tell them. And that's when their  wives are told. I don't want to screw around with them."
34681,bartlet,Good morning. We haven't meet. I'm your Commander in Chief. 
34682,bartlet,"This is the greatest fighting force in the history of the world, and I want to tell you why."
34684,toby,He's out there right now. He started.
34685,josh,We really need to get this guy to Unionville. He's going to wig.
34687,josh,Take you mind off it. Think about the lovely Cathy-- farmer's daughter with a master's degree.  Wholesome but... maybe not too wholesome. I think she liked you too.  How do you know Cathy?
34688,josh, That's great. She's really nice. Is that corn out there?
34691,bartlet,"So what will I remember? What will I tell my grandchildren? I'll tell them that I stood on the  Great Wall of China, and that I stood in the well of the U.S. House of Representitives. I'll tell  them that I sat with kings and cardinals and made an appointment to the Supreme Court, and I'll  tell them that one morning in September I got to spend a few minutes with the men and women of  Air Wing One. God bless you and your families and may he continue to shed his magnificent grace  upon the United States of America."
34692,c.j.,I need to talk to you about something.
34698,bartlet,Jennings-Pratt was in the fund?
34702,bartlet,"No kidding, it feels good out here."
34707,bartlet,You don't meet with Fitzwallace about nothing.
34714,bartlet,"Yeah, all right. Well, we're coming home now."
34723,josh,Why are we slowing down?
34728,toby,They don't have diesel.
34729,josh,Did we run out of gas becasue I said she was wholesome but not too wholesome?
34730,josh,"I don't know, you can make glow plugs explode things."
34733,josh,What are you going to do?
34734,josh,Somebody's going to pick you up out here?A black pick-up truck approaches and stops.
34736,josh,Thanks for all the help.
34737,josh,"Okay, call the State Office. Tell them to send a local volunteer. Tell them we don't  have time... You're doing it right?"
34739,josh,This is fun. We're roughing it.
34756,c.j.,"Tonight-- I was wrong about this, tonight's black tie and pool pencil only. We've got a new  addition to our running list of things Robert Ritchie's not. Speaking this morning at the  Philadelphia Financial Council the Governor said, ""I'm no scientist, but I know a thing or  two about physics."" So, for the week, you can add ""scientist"" to ""doctor,"" ""mind reader,""  and ""Chinese."""
34757,c.j.,They were dressed in rolling pins?
34758,c.j.,"I don't know. Find out though, would you?"
34759,c.j.,"He's going to try, but he's got to spend time in his office interviewing secretary candidates.  Steak sanwiches for lunch. I'll see you later."
34760,bartlet,It's still mostly transportation and technology?
34761,bartlet,"Have Josh and Toby weigh in at some point, okay?"
34763,bartlet,Come on in. Nice to meet you.
34764,bartlet,"I's crazy I know, but sometimes the schedule gets so tight that we have to schedule meetings  on the plane, so we ask you to fly with us and hit you on the way back."
34765,bartlet,Were you impressed by the plane?
34766,bartlet,It's got an apartment and an operating room.
34767,bartlet,"Okay. Well, you've met with Donald McKittridge-- he directs the Office of Presidential Personnel."
34768,bartlet,You had a moment to meet with Charlie Young?
34769,bartlet,He's probably mentioned that this was a job where you to need to be able to hold a lot of  names and dates and numbers in your head.
34770,bartlet,You were told what the pay scale was?
34772,bartlet,"Well, for instance, we have our own 747, and it's flown by an Air Force general."
34773,bartlet,"Okay, let's talk about your last job."
34774,josh,Good morning. We're stranded and waiting for a ride. Do you mind if we wait here?
34775,josh,"Well, we work for the President, actually, and he was campaining nearby this morning and..."
34776,josh,"...we got left behind by the motorcade, then our ride ran out of diesel..."
34777,josh,"Okay. Well, we'll just wait outside, if that's all right?"
34778,josh,"Well, we'll just be a few minutes, I'm sure."
34779,josh,Can we just call ahead and make sure the plane's going to be there when we fet there?
34787,josh,First guy to miss has to shave his beard.
34788,toby,"For the rest of the day... first guy to miss... anytime he says his name, has got to follow  it with, ""I work at the White House."""
34789,josh,All right. But I don't think you've meet our current host. Here we go.
34790,toby,You didn't say if you thought it was a good event this morning.
34791,josh,"Well, I didn't see the President speak this morning."
34793,josh,I was out there talking with Cathy-- I was asked to.
34796,toby,But you read the remarks.
34797,josh,Yeah.  What was your problem?
34798,toby,"You know what, Josh? I don't want this to be a high blood pressure day for me, either."
34803,josh,"""He pretends there are no energy alternatives 'cause he can't think of any."" That wasn't in the  staff copy yesterday. How did that make it into the speech today? ""He pretends there are no  energy alternatives 'cause he can't think of any."" "
34804,toby,They. They can't think of any.
34805,josh,"When we were touring flood damage in Missouri last Thursday, four times the President said,  ""Emergency managments complex."""
34807,josh,What does that matter to people who just lost their house? Finding a place for their kids to  sleep tonight is complex.
34808,toby,"Thanks, 'cause I was having a tough time prioritizing that one."
34809,josh,"Sustainable growth in Michigan, new economy in Ohio. Information technology in Pennsylvania.  That's what you talk about in September. That's what we mapped out a year ago. You and Bruno  and the President are calling audibles."
34810,toby,That's because we're coming to the line and we're seeing a hairdo from Florida in pass coverage  and so that's where we want to put the ball... What's your concern?
34811,josh,"I have any number of concerns, not the least of which we'll lose."
34813,josh,When did we decide to make this about being the smartest kid in the class? What meeting did I miss?
34814,toby,Let me tell you something. What did he say?
34818,josh,Would you get in there? 
34824,toby,I work at the White House.
34825,josh,Come on. He's Communications Diretor. It's a decent-sized whoop.
34826,josh,"Whoa, hey, danger, Will Robison. Tyler, no fooling around. We've got 15 minutes to get  to a plane that is 3 miles from here. That plane-- I swear to God-- is taking off at 1:00."
34831,josh,Wait. Wait. No. No. You're not... We changed time zones? We changed time... We changed time zones?!
34832,josh,Not for the U.S. government!
34833,toby,What kind of schmuck-ass system could this possibly...
34834,josh,That's good! That's perfect!
34835,toby,How did...? I don't understand.
34836,josh,Perfect. Just the break I'm looking for.
34837,toby,"What do...? What do...? People, they just... They reset their watches when they commute?"
34838,josh,I can't take working here.
34839,toby,"They just change their watches every time they cross a time zone? What is this, a joke?!"
34845,c.j.,"Oh, yeah. Listen, I wanted to ask you something. Simon was a Big Brother to a kid named  Anthony Marcus."
34846,c.j.,I've been trying to spend a little time with him. He's not wild about me.
34847,c.j.,"Yeah? Well, he was arrested for stealing a car. He stole his homeroom teacher's car, drove it  around for a few hours, then left it in front of a strip club. You could chalk it up to a stupid  prank, except Anthony had a string of shoplifting incidents before Simon came along, so the ADA  see it as an escalating problem which is..."
34848,c.j.,"Right, and she's pushing juvenile detention. I've spoken to her and if a White House staffer  will play a role in his life, she's willing to reconsider."
34851,c.j.,"I know, it was a longshot."
34853,c.j.,Okay.  I shouldn't have asked you.
34856,josh,"No, I'm sorry buddy. I know you're supposed to be sleeping today."
34858,josh,I'm with Toby and Donna and we are stranded somewhere in Indiana.
34860,josh,"Yeah. and then we ran out of gas, and then there was a time zone foul-up, and also,  we were waylaid by some mean schoolgirls. Alpha girls, you know what I'm saying?"
34864,josh,We're getting a lift to the Connersville Metro which is going to take us to Indianapolis  where we're going to get a flight to either Dulles or BWI or LaGuardia.
34866,josh,"I actually need you to do more than that, Sam. I need you to staff the President. He's got  one of those days."
34868,josh,"Yeah, you do. Anything ceremonial, security related, or personal, you've leave the room.  As it gets later in the day he's going to start to talk to you. You're going to tell him  how the meeting he just had with his Concil of Economic advisors relates to the meeting  he had with the Agriculture Secretary, relates to his intelligence breifing, relates to  the environment, relates to jobs, relates to education, relates to the campaign. You're  his wide-angle lens. "
34870,josh,"Welcome to the club, partner. We got jackets."
34874,josh,Let's get to the train station.
34876,bartlet,"There's a tremendous amount of informatin you need to keep track of: dates, names, number,  things I'm not good with."
34878,bartlet,"It's not intellect, it's memory. It's a different gift. A wonderful one. I've never had it."
34879,bartlet,"Well... okay, I'll try and find that time, but let's get back to you. What would you say was  the most challenging part of working for the Ambassador of France?"
34881,bartlet,I make fun of the French as much as anybody and I don't even know what that meant.
34882,bartlet,"Nah, that's okay. I think you're terrific and I appreciate your coming in and talking to us."
34885,bartlet,"Please, the market's down 425 points."
34887,bartlet,425 points represents billions of dollars which aren't there anymore heading into the fourth  quarter which is Christmas.
34890,bartlet,Why does Gallup have it a one-point race?
34891,bartlet,"Well, one day I'll buy you a beer and you'll tell us all how you did it."
34893,c.j.,"Yesterday, the First Lady appeared on KCAL, which is a local LA station. She was asked about  the suspension of her medical license and she said something like, ""I'm just a wife and mother."" "
34894,c.j.,"This is Flint Aldridge, a Southern Baptist radio host. ""This is another sign that Abbey Bartlet  is a liberal elitist feminist."""
34895,c.j.,And this is from Janet Ritchie.
34896,c.j.,"""Being a wife and a mother are the most rewarding roles I've ever played. I think Abbey Bartlet  and I have two different ambitions."""
34897,c.j.,"Anyway, it's waiting for us down on the ground."
34906,c.j.,"What the hell does that mean, ""I love it when the women get involved?"""
34908,c.j.,This is not a woman's issue. This is dumb woman's issue.
34909,c.j.,Remind me to mention that to the population of South Africa.
34911,c.j.,Several of the men I've dated haven't yet gotten over their fear of frogs.
34913,c.j.,"Yeah, the rolling pins took care of that."
34914,c.j.,Remind me to get Josh in on this. Option two?
34917,josh,"Nothing. It was just something I said. All right, ten minutes. We get the stuff to go."
34921,toby,We'd like some food to go.
34925,toby,I swear not on purpose.
34926,toby,"No, uh, we just want food."
34927,toby,You wouldn't say there was some sort of local delicacy...
34928,toby,"Right, uh...  Excuse me. Would you mind terribly if I changed  the channel to CNN for just a minute? I've, uh, been a little out of touch today. I would  like to check in with what's been going on."
34929,toby,I was just asking what's good.
34930,toby,We'll take four cheeseburgers.
34932,toby,"Okay. See, Fiona, this is exactly what I was talking about."
34940,josh,Why is it we cite Ritchie's advisors by name? The Milton Friedman economic plan? The Leonard  Tynan education plan?
34941,toby,I give credit where credit's due.
34942,josh,"It's our way of calling him a puppet, right?"
34943,toby,"Josh, he cites them more then we do, which is his way of saying, ""I want to be President  the same way you want a cold beer."""
34944,josh,"No. It's his way of saying, ""I think it's great that Bartlet's a Nobel Prize winner.  When I'm elected, I'm going to hire me some of those."""
34945,toby,"No, no. Should be what he's saying. What he's saying is, ""Eastern education isn't for real men,  but don't worry. I'll have Jews for the money stuff."" You mind calling C.J. for me?"
34946,josh,"That line from the convention speech-- ""challenges too great for a Potemkin presidentcy?"""
34948,josh,Most people weren't the smartest kid in the class. Most people didn't like the smartest kid  in the class.
34950,josh,I don't care how subliminal it is. This can't be a national therapy session.
34952,c.j.," Hey, before I forget. If you see Josh, can you ask him to stop by my office?"
34955,toby,She'd like you to stop by her office.
34957,josh,"C.J., it's me. Did you happen to notice that we weren't on the plane?"
34958,c.j.,You weren't on the plane?
34960,c.j.,What happened between Unionville and the plane?
34961,josh,We missed Unionville. We missed the motorcade.
34964,c.j.,I love dry rub. They take the meat and...
34966,bartlet,Seth Weinberger's assistant has come forward with the information that he was having an  affair with a colleague and a newspaper has printed it.
34968,bartlet,"You tell me. He'd already stepped down over OSHA. It's been two months. This is an assistant  getting her name in the paper and it's unbelievably hurtful to his wife. I don't understand it.  I don't understand the paper printed it either, but that's another day. This is terrible."
34973,bartlet,"Mitch, come on in.  Just rock and roll, Sam."
34976,bartlet,We have your input. You're talking about the exemption.
34977,bartlet,"Developing nations, and I think what's lunacy is a nation of SUV's telling a nation of  bicycles, that they have to change the way the live before we'll agree to do something  about greenhouse emission."
34978,bartlet,"Well, in international law there's a principle called differentiated responsibilties.  We're the ones making the greenhouse gas!"
34979,bartlet,"Mr. Secretary, it's not your job to tell me whose support I'm losing. We have people who  do that. It's your job to tell me whose support you just got for me."
34982,bartlet,Whatever. Seth Weinberger's old assistant...
34983,bartlet,"I don't think a lot of blind loyalty, but I think a lot less of blind betrayal."
34984,bartlet,"Yeah, that's probably why."
34985,bartlet,"Could somebody get Leo for me, please? Peter, you hear that? He called you ""congressman."""
34986,bartlet,"You think when your folks got you out in '74, they imagined they were taking you to a place  that'd be willing to make you a Congressman?"
34989,bartlet,"Takes a fisherman to catch one, though, right?"
34992,bartlet,"Leo, meet Congressman Peter Lien, Texas 22nd. Peter, this is Leo McGarry, U.S. Air Force,  144th Fighter Wing."
34994,bartlet,"Peter's family fishes in Galveston Bay, but they don't catch marlin. It's a sore spot,  and he doesn't like to talk about it. Peter's 34 years old."
34996,bartlet,"Ordinarily I would tell you that Jim Coor was a good public servant, and you've got big shoes  to fill, and he was and you do, but obviously you have a bigger symbolic responsibilty then that."
34997,bartlet,"But you biggest responsibiltity isn't symbolic, right?"
34999,bartlet,"Welcome, my freind, to the show that never ends."
35000,bartlet,Isn't that a hell of a thing? What's next?
35001,bartlet,"Yeah, it's a proud day for Alfred Nobel."
35002,bartlet,When do you think I say something?
35006,bartlet,"I told my granddaughter I was meeting you and I asked what question she wanted me to ask you  and she said to ask you of all the presidents you've met, who is your favorite and I assured  her that it would be me."
35007,bartlet,"Okay, well, I was just kidding, but, sure Truman, if you like that kind of thing."
35008,bartlet,How old were you when you met President Hoover?
35010,bartlet,"No, no. It's just... it's... You shook hands with him, and next day the Great Depression started."
35011,bartlet,"Okay. Stock market took a stumble today. You know, we'll call it... well, a little bigger than  a pre-rally decline. If you watch the news or read a newspaper or really are alive in any way,  you're going to hear about it in the next couple of hours. I'm not worried though, 'cause Tokyo  opens at 7:00 PM Eastern and Tokyo's going to be my mother's milk tonight. It's in the bag."
35013,bartlet,"I'm sorry. Sorry, could I just have one second? Charlie? "
35015,bartlet," There's a lot of science in economics to be sure  but like a lot of things, a lot depends on the user. I need the Nikkei Index to do what  I need it to do tonight and I've got Hoover's good luck charm over here. But now, while  I'm talking about it, I feel like it's ridiculous that someone like me would consider  canceling a photo-op..."
35016,bartlet,"I'm not, it's momentary."
35018,bartlet,I didn't know you were superstitious.
35020,bartlet,"Charlie, just out of curiosity, in your mind, how much time do I spend thinking about your desk?"
35021,bartlet,How long have we been talking about this now?
35022,bartlet,"Okay, let's not tell anybody that."
35027,c.j.,Whatcha' doin' on the floor?
35029,c.j.,"Come on, you'll get your pants all shmutsy."
35031,c.j.,I don't know. I can ask her.
35033,c.j.,"Brenda Swetland: ""At this moment, you're not licensed to practice medicine, correct?""  A. Bartlet: ""At this moment, I'm just a wife and mother."""
35035,c.j.,"Well, you got to want it."
35039,c.j.,"Well, I wanted my office to issue a statement saying, ""You're annoying, shut up,"" but Bruno  said to wave at it and he's right."
35041,c.j.,"Listen. I know this is the last thing you want to hear right now but I want to get Anthony a  Big Brother and Charlie said no, and I thought if it was anything you might be interested in,  I could talk to you about it. It's an hour a week. He doesn't have anybody and you know he  hasn't gotten over Simon."
35043,c.j.,There's no way you have time for this.
35047,c.j.,You just worked 48 hours straight.
35049,c.j.,And that was the weekend.
35051,c.j.,"I'm sitting here listening, already I've turned to a life of crime."
35053,c.j.,I do know that shmutsy pants.
35055,c.j.,How's it going in there?
35062,josh,"Yeah, he doesn't like the appearance that his staff is covering for him."
35064,josh,Nothing's not his fault in the Oval Office.
35066,josh,Anything else before we get on the train?
35076,josh," Don't worry, I'll have Jews for the money stuff? You have an inadvertant habit of  putting down my Judaism by implying that you have a sharper anti-Semitism meter then I do."
35077,toby,"You know, the Ancient Hebrews had a word for Jews from Westport. They pronounced it Presbyterian."
35078,josh,And by saying things like that.
35079,toby,I'm just saying I'm from Brighton Beach.
35080,josh,"Well, Mohammed al Mohammed al Mohammend bin Bizir doesn't make the distinction when he suits  up in the morning."
35081,toby,As long as you have a good grasp of the complexity of that situation.
35083,toby,I assure you neither one of us know. 
35084,josh,"Tyler, assure me there's going to be no trouble."
35085,josh,The train runs on regular fuel.
35086,josh,You guys don't have your very own international dateline in Bloomington or anything?
35087,josh,"In that case, on behalf of Bartlet for America and the Democratic Party, I want to thank you  for your help and tell you that you're a good guy, and good luck to you."
35091,toby,Toby. I work at the White House.
35093,josh,The engineer knows the route?
35101,bartlet,"You can't say ""faith-based initiatives"" to me. You have to be more specific then that.  You can't offer a guy a hot meal but first you have to accept God into your heart.  It's against the law. It's also a little obnoxious."
35102,bartlet,"No, the soup is non-denominational, Fred but I'm not talking about the soup I'm talking  about the programs. And another problem is, the government can't subsidize organizations  that discriminate in hiring practices as religious organizations are allowed to do."
35103,bartlet,"We're going to talk about it around her, but I wouldn't..."
35106,bartlet,I met with two women this morning on the plane. I'm meeting another in a little bit.
35110,bartlet,"Well, the first one isn't easily impressed."
35112,bartlet,She told me. The second one wasn't funny.
35114,bartlet,"Or rather, didn't think I was."
35116,bartlet,"She was the secretary to an Ambassador to France. I told her that I'd had dinner with  D'Astier at the Elysee Palace. She gently corrected me at that point calling it the  Palais de l'Elysee-- for that alone I wanted to sent for a parachute. And I made a  joke to D'Astier having to do with cheese and I said that D'Astier was visibly insulted  and that he was reconsidering my diplomatic status and she said, ""Well, did he?"""
35118,bartlet,It didn't bode well for me.
35120,bartlet,"A... crazy woman that Charlie knows. Hey, do we have a GPS reading out on Josh and Toby?  Have they been sighted?"
35122,bartlet,"300 IQ points between them-- they can't find their way home. I swear to God, if Donna  wasn't there, they'd have to buy a house. ""You've got to be able to keep a lot of names  and numbers in your head. Can you do that?"" ""Oh, I should think so."" Oh, should you?  Okay, well, I'm going interview a few more people, in the meantime, you can get your  ass back on the cover of the The New Yoker where it belongs."
35124,bartlet,A third one. Charlie say that I don't want anyone to replace her.
35126,bartlet,"I don't know, Sam. I'm a puzzle."
35128,bartlet,This Seth Weinberger thing makes me crazy.
35130,josh,What are the chances of that?
35132,josh,"No, no! Quaint is quaint, but we're not Navajo Indian guides, and if we want weather information  we'll call the White House Operations Center."
35136,josh,Cell phone battery's out.
35138,josh,I need information. I need to know what's happening in the world-- I have no idea what's  happening in the world!
35140,josh,I read it! Preparations are on the way for the fair-- I'm briefed. Organizors say it's going  to be the best one yet. What else you got?
35143,toby,"He meant to say ""frivolous law suits"" and he said ""frivolous law firms."""
35147,toby,"Yes, he does. He also thinks Sarajevo and Bosnia are two different contries, so that's bit  of a setback for the region."
35149,toby,"Chaberlain led England in World War II. I don't mind that he doesn't know history, I mind  that he hasn't seen a movie. ""Mexico is part of NATO."""
35150,josh,He meant they were an ally.
35151,toby,"What, did they lob a chalupa at the Warsaw Pact?"
35152,josh,"I agree, it's not impressive but as you pointed out he's going to be surrounded by..."
35153,toby,"Do you think he ever disagreed with one of his advisors? Do you think-- honestly-- do you  think he's ever said to one of his advisors ""I've got a different idea?"" I-I don't care if  he thinks Luxembourg's an uptown stop on the IRT. And I don't care about the Greco-Roman  wrestling matches with the language-- not that polished communication skills are an important  part of this job-- what I care about is when he was asked if he'd continue the current U.S.  policy in China he said, ""First off, I'm going to send them a message-- meet an American  leader."" I don't know what that means, but everybody cheered."
35154,josh,"Which is one of the reasons that I work full-time for his opponent. I don't know what gave  you the impression that I had to be convinced, but I want to win. You want to beat him, and  that's a problem for me, because I want to win."
35157,toby,"""A rising tide sinks all boats."""
35158,bartlet,"Well, it's an election year, Bill. We'd rather people didn't exercise common sense but I  agree with what you're saying."
35164,bartlet,You two know each other?
35167,bartlet,You're the alpaca farmer
35168,bartlet,"You hired Charlie, huh?"
35171,bartlet,Who was in second place? Who did I almost get?
35172,bartlet,I like to think about the road not taken.
35177,bartlet,Sorry. Why were you fired?
35179,bartlet,That doesn't sound quite right.
35181,bartlet,Only because you're asking for a job.
35185,bartlet,Charlie said it was because of him.
35186,bartlet,He said you hired him and that's why you got fired.
35188,bartlet,I'm now ordering you to tell me why you were fired.
35189,bartlet,"You were strange the first time I met you, and you're strange now."
35192,bartlet,Tell me why you were fired.
35193,bartlet,"I'm going to figure it out anyway. What I lack in memory, I more than make up for with  exceptional powers of deductive reasoning."
35194,bartlet,All right. I think the interview's over.
35196,bartlet,"Brian Dweck, CFO of Colfax and contributor to Representative Mark McKittridge whose brother  is the Director of the White House Office of Presidenial Personnel, wants a job for his son,  David-- ""Wants a Dwink of WaWa."" My powers of deduction are not to be mocked. "
35197,bartlet,"She didn't tell me anything. I ordered her to, and she... By the way, my powers of ordering  are a joke. I can create an agency, but I can't get her to... She didn't give you up. She,  um... she didn't give you up."
35199,bartlet,Have the agents stop her at the door a second.
35202,bartlet,What's the dollar doing right now?
35204,bartlet,Is the Frist Lady inside?
35208,bartlet,"""Political experts seemed surprised by the Bartlet campaigns decision to position their  candidate against motherhood. Said one spokesperson..."""
35218,bartlet, What the hell are you... It was benign. It was totally benign what you said.  These women are out of their minds. We're laughing about it here.
35220,bartlet,I'm telling... Turn on C.J.'s press briefing. She's been doing 20 minutes up there. They're  booking her into Ceasar's.
35224,bartlet,"Ah, you pulled the switcheroo."
35228,bartlet,You played upon my love for you.
35230,bartlet,Yeah. I hired someone today.
35234,bartlet,Her name is Debbie Fiderer. She used to work here.
35236,bartlet,Used to be DiLaGuardia.
35240,bartlet,She doesn't scare you a little?
35242,bartlet," No. Okay, I'm getting dressed for the thing."
35245,c.j.,The First Lady loves two out of the three of her children but she doesn't to tell them which two. 
35247,c.j.,That's when it's scheduled. Probably more like 8:30 and he's going to speak for 15 minutes.
35248,c.j.,Last OMB was $11 billion off. CBO missed by $25 billion. There's going to be a deficit but the  CBO's numbers are off. Katie.
35249,c.j.,"He can't say until he see's the bill. All right, that's a full lid. I'll see you all over there."
35250,c.j.,"Hang on a second. Okay, today at 5:32 PM Central Saving Time, two pipe bombs were set off inside  the Geiger Indoor Arena, which is the swimming team's facility at Kennison State University.  The Kennison Hawkeyes. The women's team was hosting a match. A meet with Illinois, Michigan and  Minnesota. They're all Big Ten schools. 44 people are dead.Looks like about 100 people are injured,  about 20 critically."
35251,c.j.," I'm going to have to listen in while I talk to you. Barry,  then Sydney, then Fran."
35257,c.j.,"Well, the information that they were pipe bombs is coming from... We're getting both Campus  Information and Cedar Rapids police and fire but I don't know anymore details on the type of  bombs or the extent of damage..."
35259,c.j.,"...getting specifics soon. None of that has been confirmed. Emergency squads are still on the  scene treating the minor... uh, injured. Witness's are saying there were swimmers in the water at  the time of the explosion. I don't think there's been much discussion about motives or suspects.  There's been no mention of any..."
35261,josh,We had to get out. He can't read in a moving car.
35263,josh,I need it to come in through my eyes.
35266,toby,"Did it say how, how much the percentage drop was?"
35267,josh,"It did, but by the time I got there my newspaper no longer had the molecular structure of a newspaper."
35270,josh,"Our, our flight, our flight was delayed and we're just looking for some place to dry off and  watch the news."
35271,josh,The Nikkei hasn't reacted...
35272,bartlet,"...restoring abundance amid an economic shortfall, securing peace in a time of global conflict,  sustaining hope in this winter of anxiety and fear. More than any time in recent history, America's  destiny is not of our own choosing. We did not seek nor did we provoke an assault on our freedom  and our way of life. We did not expect nor did we invite a confrontation with evil. Yet the true  measure of a people's strength is how they rise to master that moment when it does arive. 44 people  were killed a couple of hours ago at Kennison State University. Three swimmers from the men's team  were killed and two others are in critical condition. When, after having heard the explosion from  their practice facility, they ran into the fire to help get people out. Ran into the fire. The  streets of heaven are too crowded with angels tonight. They're our students and our teachers and  our parents and our friends. The streets of heaven are too crowded with angels, but every time we  think we have measured our capacity to meet a challenge, we look up and we're reminded that that  capacity may well be limitless. this is a time for American heroes. We will do what is hard We will  achieve what is great. This is a time for American heroes and we reach for the stars. God bless  their memory, God bless you and God bless the United State of America. Thank you."
35274,c.j.,"Anthony, I'm so sorry. Thank you for waiting. This thing came up at the last minute. A bomb at a  swimming meet. You probably... I can take you home now. You probably saw it here on the television  sets. "
35275,c.j.,"You know... I really miss Simon, too. That's... probably something we can talk about. I asked around  today. I wasn't able to find anyone, but I'm not done. There are more people I'm asking tomorrow  I'll take you home now."
35277,c.j.,I don't think you do need a baby-sitter...
35296,c.j.,The picture's from Deanna. I just put it in a frame. I've had it in my office for about a week.  I just keep forgetting to give it to you.
35298,josh,Campaigns aren't about the candidates.
35300,josh,They're about the voters. How-how are we going to create jobs? how-how are we going to get healthcare?  How are we going to make the lights go on? How are we going to protect ourselves?
35301,toby,"Don't you want to ask if the plumber knows which directions the pipes run? Don't you...? Forget the  plumber. Don't... (sighs)... we want leadership to sound and feel like, instead of appealing to  our-our least expensive, however legitimate, desire to fell good about our selves? Don't we want...?"
35311,toby,My boss went to Notre Dame.
35312,toby,"Yeah, I-I saw. You invested?"
35313,toby,"I'm Toby Ziegler. I work at the White House. Have a minute to talk? We'd, uh... like to buy you a beer."
35317,bartlet,They're just allowed to make things up now?
35318,bartlet,They know it was us right?
35320,bartlet,Is that what you think we should do?
35323,bartlet,"I signed a piece of paper, Fitz."
35324,bartlet,"You just hated my living guts when I got this job, didn't you?"
35325,bartlet,"Yeah, you did. I didn't know anything and I didn't have any respect for the Chiefs. You became my  counselor and you wrangled the Chiefs and you brought them to me."
35326,bartlet,"You brought them to me. And you talked Leo into Shareef and he talked me into it. It was my order  and you executed it flawlessly and I stand by it. I stand by you, I stand by you all. I stand by  it till I die. Plus, I'm going to need some cell mates in Holland. So, what do we do now?"
35329,josh,"You're telling me, we couldn't have just gone to the nearest Chinese restaurant, picked up some  Kikkoman and poured it into the soy diesel thing?"
35331,josh,"Well, we should start making cars that run on ketchup."
35333,toby,"(to shuttle driver) Excuse me, would you mind letting me off up there at the bridge?"
35334,toby,Yeah. I can walk to work from there.
35335,josh,"Yeah, I'll hop out there, too."
35337,josh,"Hey, you're the one who did the number back at the bar."
35339,josh,She can drop you off at home.
35341,toby,"If our job teaches us anything, it's that we don't know what the next President's gonna face. And if  we choose someone with vision, someone with guts, someone with gravitas, who's connected to other  people's lives, and cares about making them better... if we choose someone to inspire us, then we'll  be able to face what comes our way and achieve things... we can't imagine yet. Instead of telling  people who's the most qualified, instead of telling people who's got the better ideas, let's make  it obvious. It's going to be hard."
35342,josh,Then we'll do what's hard.
35343,bartlet,Nancy's in her office. There are some calls I asked her to make.
35345,bartlet,"Listen, I know we're here for a serious purpose, for a sober purpose, but I wanted to say  I've never been a part of a street gang before, and that's basically what we are -- a pretty  well-financed one -- but anyway, I wanted to say it feels good, and I think when we're done  with this meeting, I think we should go out and get girls, and I don't know, maybe knock over  a fruit stand or something."
35347,bartlet,We're going to need to learn to sing and dance.
35350,bartlet,Toby and Josh are back. Toby Ziegler and Josh Lyman missed the motorcade in Indiana yesterday.  It's taken them 20 hours to get home. They're walking into DC right now.
35352,bartlet,You're not curious why they're walking into DC?
35354,bartlet,Walking into DC from where I guess you got to ask.
35356,bartlet,"Okay, just for that, when it comes time to give out gang nicknames, you're going to be... I don't  know, but you're not going to have a good nickname."
35358,bartlet,"Ellie had a teacher named Mr. Pordy, who had no interest in nuance. He asked the class why there's  always been conflict in the Middle East and Ellie raised her hand and said, ""It's a centuries old  religious conflict involving land and suspicions and culture and..."" ""Wrong."" Mr. Pordy said, ""It's  because it's incredible hot and there's no water."" (to Leo) I'm hunkered down. I'm going to East  Lansing. We're going to need a lawyer."
35359,c.j.,"There are some 120 news outlets covering the hour-to-hour movements of the President. Only the cream  of the crop ride here with me. The rest are consigned to the zoo plane where they do not have moist  towelettes. This is why I'm so disappointed that with the exceptions of Terry, Mike, Mark and Rachel,  you all misspelled Muhzriabolah."
35360,c.j.,It was misspelled in your copy. I could tell.
35361,c.j.,An advance copy of text? You must be new.
35362,c.j.,"He's obviously going to talk about it, but I don't know what he's going to say. There's a filing center  behind the press riser. You'll have 50 minutes to file while the President meets wit the Executive Board."
35363,c.j.,"Pool photos, that's it."

35365,c.j.,"Well, I'm still referring those questions to Zane Littleton at the FBI. But I do want to underline their  initial finding that it doesn't appear to have been an act of foreign terrorism."
35366,c.j.,"The nature of the explosive. Okay, then. The flight to Battle Creek Air National Guard Base is an hour  and 45 minutes. It will be a 45 minute ride to Michigan State where the President will address the  delegates from the NEA for approximately 25 minutes."
35367,c.j.,"No, they made it home and their mother are very relieved. They've been given a 4 hour vacation.  Anything else? M-U-H-Z-I-R-I-A-B-O-L-A-H. "
35371,c.j.,You can't be indifferent.
35385,c.j.,"Sam, we need you in here."
35387,c.j.,Bruno thinks we dump the whole thing.
35389,c.j.,"He's got to mention it, though."
35393,bartlet,I don't know. It's a seven-ten split. Can you work on it a while?
35395,bartlet,I'm going to call Leo. I'll be in my office.
35425,bartlet,"Casper's here, he's going to talk to me. I'll send him to you next, all right?"
35427,bartlet,I don't know. I still have about two minutes.
35429,bartlet,"""The bullying nature of the intrusive and invasive government of the United States has to be rendered  quickly and decisively a wake-up call. And this opportunity..."" What do you think of this letter?"
35432,bartlet,You guys think it was sent by the bomber?
35433,bartlet,We think there's a group.
35434,bartlet,The end of the letter promises more.
35435,bartlet,Unless what? That's where I'm confused.
35436,bartlet,"All right, what do you have?"
35437,bartlet,"Yes, plus once we catch a perpetrator, you don't need to track him down."
35440,bartlet,I think I'm just going to talk for a little bit.
35443,bartlet,"Thank you very much. Thank you. ""Joy cometh in the morning,"" scripture tells us. I hope so. I don't  know if life would be worth living if it didn't. And I don't yet know who set off the bomb at Kennison  State. I don't know if it's one person or ten, and I don't know what they want. All I know for sure,  all I know for certain, is that they weren't born wanting to do this. There's evil in the world. There'll  always be, and we can't do anything about that. But there's violence in our schools, too much mayhem in  our culture and we can do something about that. There's not enough character, discipline, and depth in  our classrooms. There aren't enough teachers in our classrooms.  There isn't nearly enough,  not nearly enough, not nearly enough money in our classrooms, and we can do something about that. We're  not doing nearly enough, not nearly enough to teach our children well. And we can do better, and we must  do better, and we will do better. And we will start this moment today! They weren't born wanting to do this."
35459,josh,Yes. I have to talk to you.
35467,josh,I'm perfcetly fine waiting. I have the patience of an adult.
35469,josh,It came to me in my sleep this morning 'cause whrn I got home the paper was already there. Page two  of the business section in today's Post there's an article about Redstar and the $35 million retention  bonus they gave to... I can't remember his name.
35471,josh,"So we all know that CEOs get bonuses that workers don't. But in the sixth graph, thay talk about  Congress ending the deductibility of salaries over a million and that the measure excluded items  that the IRS deemed to be incentive based. In other words, the bonuses are tax deductible. In other  words, Wadkins gets $35 million for crashing the company and the company gets a deduction. Toby,  college costs-- investment in the future workforce, in innovation, in the ideas economy, investment  in crime reduction-- Isn't that a better idea then writing off the bonuses? The guy last night in  the bar, Matt Kelley, the one who's taking his daughter to visit colleges. He said it needs to be  just a little easier. Not a lot easier, a little. Toby, every nickel spent on college tuition should  be 100% tax deductible. Not capped and indexed and bracketed. Every nickel. 100 percent. What?"
35472,toby,That's exactly what I was going to tell you.
35475,josh,You're saying that now just to make it seem... I'm going to make some time with Leo.
35476,toby,And figure out a way to pay for it.
35483,josh,"I did, but then I read this thing... How you doing?"
35487,josh,Are we in any danger at all of losing Massachusetts?
35489,josh,Why am I doing this again?
35491,josh,I can't we just go straight to the event?
35497,josh,"You've just been practicing for when I asked the question, right?"
35499,josh,And you made up Cruel Shoes?
35505,josh,"You know, everybody's really over that now."

35510,c.j.,"No, but he rode around on a horse. You sleep?"
35511,josh,I did better then that.
35512,c.j.,"Well, keep it to yourself. I need you to weigh in on Ritchie and Title IX."
35513,josh,"Yeah, I saw that. I wrote a memo."
35515,josh,"Toby and I are working on tuition, it would be..."
35521,josh,They're almost over it. We want to talk to you about an issue that should be in play in the campaign  right away.
35522,josh,v. Commision on the Presidential Debates?
35523,toby,They're never going to rule for him.
35524,toby,Yeah. They're never going to rule for him. This suit gets brought all the time.
35528,josh,We're back. We'r never leaving again.
35531,josh,Would you tell him he doesn't have to worry about the District Court?
35533,josh,He's worried 'cause it's Wengland.
35535,josh,I'm going back to my office.
35539,c.j.,They ruled for Sullivan?
35540,c.j.,"Can I see a copy of the decision? ""The Commission, tax-exempt entity, is legally precluded from partisan  politics of any kind. The 15% rule, benefiting the two major parties, is partisan politics of the worst  kind --regulatory duopoly, democracy by favoristic fiat, a bureaucratic junta..."""
35541,c.j.,"""...that is clearly prohibited under federal law."" "
35542,toby,"There's no way ""favoristic's"" a word."
35544,josh,It's not like we're going to have to search high and low for that.
35547,josh,You can be excluded but the bar is set much...
35548,c.j.,"The Republicans, we're going to probably have to let in."
35556,toby,"I had a thought before and Toby claims, at any rate, to have had that same thought."
35557,toby,"I showed you, like, DNA evidence of..."
35558,josh,When Congress put the million cap on deducting salary they left a loophole for incentive-based bonuses.
35563,josh,Why isn't college tuiton 100% tax deductible.
35565,toby,"We can cap it at $80,000?"
35569,josh,"Nobody's talked to the OMB, but I think it cost $50 billion. Closing the loophole is about  $35 billion. Am I close?"
35573,josh,"She's talking to me, right?"
35577,c.j.,The machismo manifesto.
35580,josh,Bruno asked me to weigh in.
35581,c.j.,I can't imagined why he called on you.
35582,josh,"I was asked as a campaign issue if we should re-examine Title IX. Which is, by the way, a wedge with  male voters in Ohio, Michigan and North Carolina."
35583,c.j.,So are a lot of things.
35584,josh,"There's something fair but dumb about a 50-50 split when more men are interested in sports than women--  and don't cite the WNBA and soccer. More men are interested in sports than women. We don't need a study  to tell us that. But if we did, there's about 493 of them."
35585,c.j.,Are you going to talk to someone in Stackhouse's camp?
35586,josh,About the Sullivan decision?
35587,c.j.,You should probably just make sure.
35588,josh,"The Court's going to stay the judgement, even if they don't, Stackhouse will pass on the debate.  He's not out to kill the President. He just wants to keep him honest."
35589,c.j.,"It might be nice if you make a courtesy call though, so we're not taking him for granted."
35591,c.j.,"Since Title IX, women's participation in sports has increased 800%. That's not a typo-- it worked."
35594,c.j.,It's making the rounds that Governor Ritchie called the Chancellor's office.
35595,bartlet,What's wrong with that?
35596,c.j.,He's angling for an invitation to the memorial in Saturday. He wants to speak.
35597,bartlet,"Oh, for the love of Mike."
35598,c.j.,The Chancellor was with us in Iowa and the Ritchie people were quietly saying that allowing you to be  National Healer in Chief...
35599,bartlet,"Look, win or lose on the 5th, I'm the President right now, right?"
35600,c.j.,"Um, yeah, I'm almost sure."
35601,bartlet,"Six -- look, six of the girls were exactly Zoey's age. Tell the Chancellor's office that if it'll make  his life easier, I'll sit in row 19 and you'll keep out the press. This has to be about the students  and the families, and Ritchie and I are simply going to have to summon the humanity to keep this from  being a political event."
35607,c.j.,"Thank you, Mr. President."
35608,bartlet,How did you do with Jordan?
35616,bartlet,"All right. In the meantime, what do we do have by way of stalling tactics?"
35618,bartlet,We ought to be good at that.
35619,bartlet,State thinks he had a friendly relationship with the West.
35620,bartlet,Shareef is now alive and well and living in Libya?
35621,bartlet,All right. Come back and tell me how we do it.

35625,bartlet,The internet has been a phenomenal tool for hate groups.

35628,bartlet,How is it so many yesterday?
35630,bartlet,Ten of those under the bleachers at a basketball game?
35635,bartlet,"In ascending order of age, would you get my daughters on the phone, please?"
35637,josh,I just tried Stackhouse again.
35639,toby,Stackhouse is going to be fine.
35641,toby,"At $55,000 Matt Kelly's is in the 27.5% bracket. Let's assume he takes the standard deductions and  let's forget for a moment mortgage payments."
35642,josh,What's his tax liabiity?
35644,josh,"We're saying that books are tax deductibile, too, right?"
35645,toby,I personally think that beer should be tax deductible
35646,josh,"So, with one kid in college, Mat Kelly's tax liability just dropped from 13,000... to 3,800?  If we can get this done, it'll be a good days work."
35647,toby,Let's take it to C.J. when she get's off.

How many want kids? How many want their kids to go to good schools and walk on safe streets? Decisions are made by those who show up! You gotta rock the vote!"
35653,bartlet,Tractor starter fluid doesn't kill you?
35655,bartlet,You think these might be our guys?
35657,bartlet,We have reason to believe they're connected KSU?
35659,bartlet,"All right. Let's get the Director and the Attorney General. We only go in on my order, okay?  It'll be my order."
35660,bartlet,You just knew it was going to end up like this.
35661,bartlet,Allergy medicine and tracker fluid we're getting high on now.
35663,bartlet,Is this going to get ridiculuos?
35664,bartlet,We'll see it Al Jazeera?
35665,bartlet,"No disinformation to U.S. press, right? We don't give disinformation to the American press? Unless  it's about my health?"
35667,bartlet,All this posturing is a preamble to something.
35674,bartlet,That makes three of us.
35675,bartlet,Take all the time you want. You done yet?
35676,bartlet,"Well, that makes us ground-breaking, doesn't it?"
35678,bartlet,"Due respect, Ms. Kendall, I'm the last person to whom that needs to be pointed out. And Article 51 of  the United Nations charter says every nation has a right to wage war to defend itself."

35683,bartlet,"Well, that's what I was hoping you'd say. I want there to be justice. That's why I'm talking to lawyer.  Anyway, I just came in to say hello."
35685,bartlet,I'm heading back to the residence.
35689,bartlet,"Why couldn't you have stopped with ""I sincerely apologize?"""

35711,josh,"Yeah, I haven't heard back. What... What did you say?"
35712,josh,"Yeah, they're-they're not returning my call. I shouldn't be nervous, right?"
35713,josh,Did you say you missed me?
35714,josh,What do you mean I should be nervous?
35716,josh,The District Court says Howard Stackhouse can appear in the debate. Is Stackhouse... under new management?
35717,josh,"This is not-not the deal we made with them. In one week, he is supposed to endorse te President."
35718,josh,"He's not. So, he's-he's moving you from consultant... "
35719,josh,It wasn't the deal we had. 
35721,c.j.,It's 'casue corporations donate to all the members of the tax writing committee.
35723,c.j.,"Ritchie's all ready coming after us for politicizing the budget. Plus, Leo hates to make policy  through tax code, 'cause then we can't do any kind of reform without unraveling it."
35725,josh,"Yeah. If the Sullivan decision's upheld, Stackhouse wants into the debate. He's not going to  endorse the President."
35729,c.j.,Another reason not to do it.
35730,toby,"There are a lot of reasons not to do it. But... we met a guy last night at an airport hotel in the bar.  His daughter was upstairs in the room. They'd been looking at colleges. He makes $55,000 a year. His  mutual fund got beat up yesterday on Wall Street. And he was so happy to be taking his daughter to  colleges. He came downstairs to the bar 'cause he didn't want her to see that he didn't know how he  was going to pay for it. There are a lot of reasons not to do it, but during the first campaign the  President said there are two kinds of politicians."
35732,toby,We're going to throw these guys out 'cause they want to say no.
35733,c.j.,"I guess if we're going to get thrown out, I don't want it to be for that. Let's take it to Leo."
35734,toby,"Matt, it's me from last night. yeah, we got... got home fine, thanks. Now, let me tell you what we're working on."
35735,josh,"Just throw strikes. I don't understand why that can't happen. You have a three-run lead,  just throw strikes. I mean, my God!"
35739,josh,"I'll tell you something else. In a situation with a runner on first who's a threat to score  and a batter at the plate who's going to be intentionally passed, why not pitch out four times?"
35745,josh,"You know, there comes a day in every man's life, and it's a hard day, but there comes a day  when he realizes he's never going to play professional baseball."
35747,josh,"Yes I am. You understand, you're going to be walking a guy anyway. You're going to be throwing  four balls. Why not just...?"
35749,josh,"Yeah, why not just, you know, to...  ...catch the runner."
35751,josh,I know how Ritchie's going to win this election.
35752,c.j.,"Red Mass, Red Mass, Red Mass, you say. Red Mass is at... You're right-- 10:00 at the Shrine  of the Immaculate Conception which is also what they called my dorm room in college. No,  but seriously, Katie."
35753,c.j.,"The President believes the debates are good and that more the better. The President's asked for  five debates. Governor Ritchie's asked for two. The President said, ""How about four?"" Governor  Ritchie said, ""How about two?"" We're waiting for the commision to make its recommendation."
35754,c.j.,"At this point, participating in one would be a victory."
35757,c.j.,Seriously. We'll be headed to Rock Creek Park at 2:30. Thank you.
35758,c.j.,I know how Ritchie's going to win this election.

35772,bartlet,All right. All right. Let's line up validators.
35776,bartlet,And update our resumes.
35781,bartlet,What? You're doing the face.
35782,josh,"Needle exchange in a speech to the AMA: ""We ought to begin and end with abstinence. We ought to  begin and end with personal responsibility."""
35783,toby," I'd like someone to ask Ritchie if he's aware that needle exchange cost $9,000 for  every infection stopped. Treating someone with HIV cost $200,000. I'd like someone to ask him  that. I'd like someone to ask him where the repsonsibility was in paraphernalia that made it a  crime to buy or carry a syringe, which is why addicts share infected needles in the first place.  I'd like someone to ask him that, too."
35786,josh,"It's really only a issue if Stackhouse responds, but if he does..."
35790,josh,I don't know. But if-if he does we can't come out for it. Bruno thinks we'll be putting three  states back into play.
35793,bartlet,They've always been iffy about me in Maine. I don't know why.
35794,josh,"It's a mystery, sir. You can't come out against either. You'll alienate..."
35797,bartlet,Whatever. Let's worry about if Stackhouse does something.
35798,josh,"Okay, but at that point, I'll be very worried."
35801,toby,I'd like someone to ask him about the responsibility in cutting the drug that treatment that would  eliminate needle-related HIV. Half of all people getting infected are getting infected by the needle.  I'd like someone to ask him how he thinks the personal responsibility plan's going so far.
35802,c.j.,"I'll get on that, but I want to talk to you about the debates."
35803,toby,"When we mention that we want five debates, say what they are. One on the economy, one on foreign  policy, with another on global threats and national security, one on the environment, and one on  strengthening family life, which would include health care, education, and retirement. I also think  there should be one on parts of speech and sentence structure, and one on fractions."
35804,c.j.,"Is there any chance I'm going to get an oppurtunity to speak in this conversation, or are you just  writing out loud?"
35805,toby,I didn't even know you were in the room.
35806,c.j.,"Toby, I'm absolutely terrified we're going to lose the expectations game. I can't believe how many  times I get asked what would be a win in the debates. At this point I feel like if -- and only if --  Ritchie accidentally lights his podium on fire does the President have a fighting chance."
35808,c.j.,"Disagree all you want, but I'm right."
35809,toby,"These two men are going to be side by side on the stage, answering questions. That's the ball game."
35810,c.j.,"If the whole thing is, he can't tie his shoelaces and it turns out he can, then that is the ball game."
35811,toby,And I believe he'll have to do more than tie his shoelaces.
35813,josh,"Hey, what are you doing tomorrow?"
35815,josh,"Guy, that sounds great. If only you were actually doing all those things."
35819,josh,"Well, he has millions of followers worldwide, has a $20-billion empire of self-help seminars..."
35821,josh,"...workbooks, board games..."
35823,josh,"Capitol Sheraton, tomorrow morning 10:00 AM. Your registration's been prepaid."
35827,josh,"He's consulted for Ritchie in the last few weeks, and I would like for that to be embarrassing  for Ritchie."
35831,josh,"I don't believe it does. Write down any key slogans, or philosophies, or slogans."
35833,josh,Proabably. You know what I'm looking for.
35837,josh,Meet me here at the office when you're done.
35859,josh,And now he's on every survivalist's mailing list?
35860,josh,"Anyways, yes, they're well supplied, but they're not endlessly supplied. We can wait them out."
35861,josh,A guy told me I should take flying lessons cause it would relax me. I don't think it you. Do you?
35863,josh,"Not having any guns of my own. Obviously you know John Baxley -- Congressman Baxley ... Senators  Jackson and White, Secretaries Weaver and Keaton."
35864,josh,"Excuse me. Now that I have you all sitting down, I'll be right outside the door."
35888,bartlet,Why do we think the boy is sick?
35894,bartlet,"All right. We should do it. Let's get the kid. Good luck, everybody. Good luck, Casper."
35897,josh,Hello. Is Susan Thomas...
35900,josh,I've always like Stackhouse. I'd vote for him too but he's not on the ballot in Conneticut or 22  other states. Perhaps I should vote in New York or California where he's polling at four percent.
35903,josh,"And why is that good? Why are we eager...Why are we encouraging a group of people who are so  howl-at-the-moon, lazy-ass stupid that they can't bring themselves to raise their hands?  Why is it important that they be brought into the process?"
35905,josh,You lost your job in a fashion that insured you 93 better offers.
35907,josh,He's taking the President's votes. It's as simple... He is taking the President's votes.
35919,josh,You're reading the book?
35925,josh,"Man, and you call me a snob."
35929,josh,"So, report to me-- what did he say?"
35935,josh,Because it's not harmless in an American President.
35937,josh,Open this book to any page. 
35938,josh,"Okay, well. This is an order form to buy ""Owning Yourself,"" follow-up to the bestseller..."
35940,josh,"""It's good to be trapped in a corner. That's when you act."""
35942,josh,"It is. In my case, it's the only time that I do."
35944,josh,"It's Immanuel Kant! ""Duty! Sublime and mighty name, that embraces nothing charming or insinuating  but requires submission."" Every year a million freshman philosophy students read that sentence. "
35946,josh,"You've just got a mouth full of wiseass today, don't you?"
35948,josh,Could you locate it again?
35950,josh,"It comes from a 193-page book called ""A Critique of Practical Reason."" It's about metaphysica and  epistemology. Tomba's impressively boiled it down to two-thirds of one page. Give me another one."
35952,josh,"Right. That's from an old paperback called ""The Republic"" by Plato. Lucky Tomba's been able to  fit on fortune cookie so it suits the attention span of the Republican nominee. Here he quotes  Robert Frost. ""Good fences make good neighbors."" Did he talk about that?"
35956,josh,You had to study modern poetry.
35958,josh,Is that what Frost meant?
35960,josh,"Why did he say ""Good fences make good neighbors?"""
35962,josh,"What does this remind you of? ""I believe in hope, not fear."" ""I'm a leader, not a politician.""  ""It's time for an American leader."" ""America's earned a change."" ""I before 'E' except after 'C'!""  It's the fortune-cookie candidacy! These are important thinkers, and understanding them can be  very useful and it's not ever going to happen at a four-hour seminar. When the President's got  an embassy surrounded in Haiti, or a keyhole photograph of a heavy water reactor, or any of the  fifty life-and-death matters that walk across his desk every day, I don't know if he's thinking  about Immanuel Kant or not. I doubt it, but if he does, I am comforted at least in my certainty  that he is doing his best to reach for all of it and not just the McNuggets. Is it possible we  would be willing to require any less of the person sitting in that chair? The low road? I don't  think it is."
35968,josh,You sure it wasn't Vern?
35970,josh,Let me know when the report gets in.
36019,toby,"""Giving the inability of the two major..."" Do you mind that I'm reading this?"
36021,toby,"""...the two major parties to agree upon earlier Commission proposals, the uncertainty caused by  recent Court rulings, and the shortened time period in which to schedule debates for maximum  viewing, the Commission hereby amends..."" He got exactly what he wanted! For dragging his feet!"
36023,toby,I'm not faulting him; I'm faulting them.
36029,bartlet,One suspect... you should tell him.
36030,bartlet,Wounded in the leg. That's it.
36035,bartlet,"Univerisy Hospital. Stable condition. Mike, pick yourself out a daughter. My oldest is married,  but I can have it annulled. The Pope said he'd do it, I swear to God."
36036,bartlet,"Jerry, ws that note anything I need?"
36037,bartlet,Where did it originate?
36039,bartlet,Okay. Somebody will keep me posted.
36040,bartlet,"Mike? No kidding, thank you."
36042,bartlet,"Yeah, call that play on first down again, Coach 'cause I'm sure they're not ready for it this time.  You know, if you ask a professional athlete what the hardest thing is to do in sports, they'll all  say ""hit a baseball."" But a coach once told me that the hardest thing to do in sports is to walk  into your Super Bowl locker room at half-time and change the strategy that got you there 'cause  it's no longer working."
36043,c.j.,"It's really okay that after almost every play, somebody requires medical attention?"
36044,bartlet,"It's not even the number of debates, as much as the format. 2 minute response followed by a 1  minute reply. That's not a debate. That's not a debate! It's a joint press conference."
36046,bartlet,"Nice job on the Red Mass. First rate.You don't mind if I change everything, do you?"
36048,bartlet,Here... here... and I added a section here.
36050,bartlet,It's a joint press conference. It's not neccesary for the candidates to be in the same room.  That part's just theater.
36051,c.j., We're talking about ways to possibly lower expectations.
36053,bartlet,"Be nice to be able to respond to what the other person has said, and ask them a question. And  the moderator should be empowered to press for an answer, just as a judge can of a witness,  or a member of Congress in a confirmation hearing."
36055,c.j.,"Sam, what do you think about me writing you an urgent memo? ""I think Ritchie's a more skilled  debater than we're anticipating. He has, after all, debated three gubernatorial candidates and  won each time."" "
36062,bartlet,"Cicero wanted to restore the overthrown king of Egypt, and the Roman Senate debated all day and  into the night, every military and diplomatic consequence until they collapsed on the Senate floor.  Lentulus is trying to overthrow the Republic. Ceaser goes up against Cato-- by the way, in the very  first public debate on the death penalty. They were against each other, it was a debate and they  explored the meaning of spirituality and suffering."
36064,bartlet,"That's right, but my point..."
36067,c.j.,"Ask for a different format. We didn't get the number of debates we wanted, so why not ask for a  different format?"
36070,bartlet,The Ritchie people wold put up too much of a fight.
36071,c.j.,They might consider it. The might consider it if we give them something else they wanted.
36072,bartlet,"Other then this House, we don't have anything else they want."
36074,bartlet,Wow. Isn't this exactly why casino's don't play with a one-deck shoe?
36077,bartlet,"He's still running that screen pass. Get Toby to sign off, and I'm in."
36078,bartlet,This is going to be interesting. Do I need my speech?
36079,bartlet,"And so how isn't it a Constitutional issue? It is, but sometimes you say, ""Big deal."" It was  the intention not to have a national religion, not to have anyone's religious views imposed  on anyone else, and not to have the government encourage a national display of piety as a  substitute for real action. I'll be in the office a minute."
36080,josh,"Yeah, let me ask you another. With a runner on first who's a threat to steal, why don't you..."
36083,josh,What are you doing here?
36084,josh,What are you doing here?
36086,josh,"Can you give me any indication, what's the senator's thinking?"
36095,toby,Nope. Stay there. I'm first looking for something to beat you with.
36097,toby,I'm going to do it with my hands.
36098,c.j.,Let me tell you something.
36100,c.j.,What's really the difference between one debate and two debates?
36101,toby,What's the difference betw...? It's a whole other debate. It's a second debate! It's 100% more debate!
36102,c.j.,"Someone should ask him if he's aware taxpayers pay $9,000 this instead of $200,000 that.  And somebody should ask him what he means by, and somebody should ask him how he plans on...""  You said that, and you were right!"
36103,toby,"What if he has a bad night? It's happened. What if he gets himself into trouble? What if Ritchie  comes after Abbey or the kids and the President goes postal? That's what I'd try to do. Stress,  hot lights... What if he has an episode?"
36104,c.j.,"We lose. When you can't lower expectations, you only have one thing you can do. You have to meet them."
36105,toby,Clear 24 hours from the President's schedule. We're going away.
36107,c.j.,"Well, I don't know, Susan."
36109,bartlet,Thank you. I didn't write much of it.
36110,bartlet,That part I wrote. I added it.
36111,bartlet,"You did, Howard. You did all the time."
36114,bartlet,Would it be possible to move the press off the church grounds? I'm going to take questions for  a little while.
36118,c.j.,If you'll move off the church grounds. Just move back.
36119,bartlet,Affirmative action and quotas are about two different things. Affirmative action is about  providing people an opportunity they might not otherwise get.
36121,bartlet,What that hell is...? I don't support racial profiling.
36125,bartlet,"'Cause bite me, that's why."
36126,c.j.,It's a legitamate question.
36127,bartlet,"It's been almost four years Sam, how long do you want to say ""I told you so?"""
36128,josh,"He wasn't saying ""I told you so,"" sir. We need an answer on Rooker."
36129,bartlet,"What wrong with ""bite me?"""
36132,c.j.,"""It's never been shown that racial profiling works, and I'm against it."""
36133,josh,"That answer's pretty simple, isn't it?"
36134,c.j.,We can make it more complicated.
36136,bartlet,"I think she was talking to me there, Dexter. What?"
36138,bartlet,How you doing there Joey? Kippy?
36141,bartlet,"Is that what you were saying, Andy?"
36142,c.j.,"Yeah, but Richie will bring it back to Rooker and the fact that you don't know what your  position on racial profiling..."
36143,bartlet,I do know what my position is.
36144,toby,"We're losing the question. Fundamentally, it's ""What was the story with Rooker?"""
36145,c.j.,We gave him our full support until it became clear that an increasingly divided Congress  was going to shoot down our nominee.
36146,toby,We didn't give him our full support. We withdrew the nomination.
36147,josh,Why not blow past the nomination fight and give a strong...
36148,c.j.,Blow past the nomination fight?
36149,josh,"...and give a strong, unambiguous statement in support of law enforcement?"
36150,toby,'Cause that's not going to be the vote.
36151,josh,"Nobody's for stronger, fairer law enforcement."
36152,toby,That's not going to be the question.
36156,bartlet,Were you doing me just then?
36160,bartlet,"Anybody else do a pretty good Bartlet? It's talent night here at Debate Camp, anybody want to  do a little skit? "
36161,bartlet,"Apparently, eight Israeli Thunder fighters--these are also known as American-made Boeing F15E  Strike Eagles--have hit two terrorist bases in the north and south of Qumar. And while no Qumari  government personel or institutions were destroyed, Qumar, of course, considers an attack on its  soil to be an act of war. So we are, as always, one bad bottle of Tequila away from all-out war  in West Asia. (to Sam) Would you like to take this one or shall I?"
36165,bartlet,(leaving room) I agreed to be locked up with you people for 48 hours. How much time do I  have left?
36168,bartlet,Defense condition three for the bases in Qumar is what?
36170,bartlet,What's happening on the ground?
36173,bartlet,"Alright. Well, we've got ourselves a Marx Brothers' movie."
36174,bartlet,"You have the order. Oh, Fitz."
36176,bartlet,"Well, we've made camp in North Carolina for prep, so I've been thinking about killing myself,  but let me ask you something. Besides Qumar, Iran, Syria, Hezbullah, they've all got short  and medium-range missiles. If Israel feels threatened by them, what happens?"
36179,bartlet,"Well, for the moment, they haven't stood up, but in the meantime, let's think of something  we can give them when they do."
36183,bartlet,"Honey, if we're going to have this fight, can we not do it in front of the Joint Chiefs?  It just scares the hell out of them."
36185,bartlet,"Mr. Chairman, would you put our bases in Qumar at Defense Condition 3 with the U.S. Military  at Defcon Four?"
36188,toby,A couple of things. I need you to look at a couple of answers on defense readiness. I need  concrete examples of waste in Pentagon procurement. We need two more members of the IRC for  post spin. I need you to fill out this marriage license and paperwork for a joint checking  account and review this 60-second answer on Rwanda.
36189,toby,"See, by my count, you said under no circumstances to the IRC post spin and sure...."
36192,toby,"Hey, that was good, Sam. Stay up in his face. Don't back off."
36195,josh,He's right. Don't back off.
36205,toby,"See, sometimes if I slam on the brakes, you run right past."
36206,josh,"Okay, fill us in on everything you've got so far between the two of you."
36207,toby,"(sarcastically) Yeah, that's what's going to happen right now. "
36209,toby,Are you going to stay up in his face?
36215,toby,(with certainty) It was the 15th. It was January 15th.
36227,c.j.,(walks in) He's a Democrat with a record the right win can't complain about. (sits)
36228,josh,"Donna is at the White House, as a matter of fact."
36229,c.j.,(surprised) She's at the White House?!
36231,c.j.,"She knows the old tenants are still there, right?"
36232,josh,"She's being taken out to lunch by her predecessor, a guy who's the assistant to Mac McConnell,  the assistant to the Deputy C.O.S."
36233,c.j.,Nobody did that with me. (to Leo) Anybody do that with you?
36235,josh,(interrupts) He's who the judiciary calls when they want to put a stamp on a yes. He has a  record conservatives can't complain about.
36238,toby,"Yeah. (irritated) Congresswoman Wyatt is also Mrs. Ziegler. Just... uh, I'll be right out."
36239,toby,You think we're going to get hit from the left?
36243,josh,He gets a honeymoon. Let's take advantage.
36249,bartlet,(enters) We got Rooker. 
36265,toby,Can we maybe talk about this over here? 
36266,toby,A blackout in Alexandria? 
36267,toby,"No it's not no sweat. In fact, it's a bit gruesome."
36268,toby,"It's... something. You get off on the 4th floor, which is clearly marked for all the other  passengers on the elevator to read that it's the fertility clinic. And you're trying to show  with your body language that it's not you and that's impossible to show with body language.  An 84-year-old Welsh nurse hands you a brown paper bag with a cup and a video and points you  toward a room, where I won't even tell you the name they have for this room."
36270,toby,"It's not a good out loud word. You take the longest walk of your life back to the Welsh nurse,  who takes the cup out of the bag and says, ""Very nice."""
36271,toby,Can't it possibly wait until next week...
36272,toby,"(snaps angrily) It's January 15th, Andy. I can't have a baby today. He's getting sworn in five  days. I'm not saying never. I'm saying, can we wait five days?"
36273,toby,Rooker's going to be the AG. 
36277,josh,When do you suppose Georgia got so far out of reach? Was it 'cause we... burned it down?
36279,toby,How much money is it going to take to win there?
36280,toby,"I'm going to stop you there. Joey, I-I can't go to him with it."
36281,c.j.,"No, I'm with Toby. I don't think you understand how the President feels about his home state.  He's a New Hampshire Bartlet. It's been home for centuries. He's a Democrat elected to the  statehouse with close to 60% and the fact that the state's in play is a real embarrasment for  him. He doesn't want to campaign there because that's embarassing too, but we really can't..."
36282,josh,"Joey, no kidding-- if you asked the President which he'd rather win, New Hampshire or the  election, he'd have to think before he answered. Put a pin in it; we'll come back after prep.  Thanks."
36283,josh,We're trying this again. Sorry.
36284,bartlet,"Well, that's an extraordinary and unsurprisingly dumb interpretation of what it is my  administration's trying to accomplsh. "
36285,bartlet,"It's hard enought to rasie kids today with help from family leave, subsidized daycare, preschool--  we need more of it, not less."
36287,bartlet,"I have three grown daughters, Governor. You really want to tell me how I should raise my family?  You're really comfortable with that?"
36289,bartlet,You want to tell other American fathers and mothers what they're doing wrong?
36291,bartlet,"I didn't think you did. So, why don't we stick to what government can do-- which is collect money  and distribute it-- and stop wasting time by sentimentalizing family."
36295,toby,I like the aggressive answer. It's just right.
36296,bartlet,"That wasn't the question, Larry. The question was, ""What do I have against families?"" and  the answer is I have nothing against them at all."
36298,bartlet,They simply aren't mentioned in the Executive Powers section.
36299,c.j.,"Larry's right, we have to put him on the right side of this. He is on the right side of this,  but we need help with the answer."
36300,josh,"You're asking me to do that which I don't want to do, right?"
36303,c.j.,I have a press briefing.
36304,c.j.,Good afternoon. Today is January 22nd. Let me brief you on the President's morning schedule.  He started with... How's that?
36309,c.j.,I'm going to stay here and practice.
36310,c.j.,"No, David, the President was very clear about that. Mark, then Katie. Mark, Katie, Jessie,  Phil, Steve, Betsy, Julie, Julie, Julia, Kevin, Paul, Tom, Sondra, Suzanne... (sighs) Mike,  Danny... Elizabeth. 18th seat. 18 you can vote... ""vote"" sounds like ""moat""... which is a  trench-- Trent."
36315,c.j.,I really don't know what to say in response to that sort of kindness.
36317,c.j.,I think the President's pretty much made up his mind.
36318,c.j.,"Yes, but we got as many as we needed for now, so..."
36322,bartlet,What are we doing right now?
36327,bartlet,"I'm meeting with the leadership, I'm signing six Executive Orders I don't yet understand..."
36329,bartlet,"God, I thought that was a closet."
36331,bartlet,"All right, the rooms got four doors, it's huge."
36333,bartlet,Do you understand them?
36335,bartlet,"C.J., what are you doing?"
36336,c.j.,"I'm sorry, sir. I just wanted to see Leo."
36337,bartlet, He's standing right there.
36339,bartlet,Would you get your ass in here? Could everyone stop acting strange?
36341,c.j.,"A reporter for a conservative Christian magazine introduced himself and happened to serve on  a city counsel with Rooker, which is true-- it was in Miami."
36343,c.j.,The reporter said that he liked Rooker's position on racial profiling.
36345,c.j.,"No, it's not. We found the transcript. ""I'm not saying it should be active policy, but there  is no question in my mind that in certain situations, racial profiling can be helpful to law..."""
36348,bartlet,"It's our second day, how do you think it's going so far?"
36352,josh,You're breathing very hard.
36353,josh,Then what are you doing?
36357,josh,How do we stand strong for the modern family in all its quirks and not seem like we're dissing  everyone born before 1962?
36360,josh,You're going to this meeting?
36362,josh,"WW-160, you been able to find it?"
36364,josh,I'm looking on this side again.
36366,josh,"Well, we may as well get used to having meetings in the corridors from now on. It may be our  only hope. I know now why they made the Oval Office a special shape."
36368,josh,NAACP doesn't want to see a black Attorney General?
36372,josh,I'm talking to intergovernmental. Does anybody know where WW-160 is?! Hi. I'm Josh Lyman. You all  work for me. Does anybody know where WW-160 is?
36373,josh,"That one hasn't seen it. She's... you know, she's keeping an eye out though."
36375,josh,This is the guy. This is the story.
36377,josh,We were looking for West Wing 160.
36379,josh,"Leo, this is a strong deserving nominee. Sam, it's not hubris. He should be Attorney General."
36382,toby,"Let's line up people for IP, the mornings... ""Cornell Rooker has an exceptional record as a  U.S. attorney... a leader in fighting employment discrimination...was college chair of...  He's tough on crime, he's fair on justice."" That's the line. Say that. Do not say that. What  the hell was that? ""He's tough on crime, he's fair on justice."" Sings a song, has a moustache?  What is that supposed to..."
36383,c.j.,Toby's gone to the zoo.
36386,josh,"Here it is. ""Take a thorough look at Cornell Rooker's record, you'll see..."
36388,josh,"...he's fought for justice his entire carer. If you take a thorough look at Cornell Rooker  record, you'll see he's fought for justice his entire career."""
36389,toby,I don't want to be able to turn my head tomorrow without reading that quote.
36394,josh,"Yeah, hey. How do you do?"
36396,josh,"Guess what I have here. It's a copy of ""21 Magazine."" It's for ""Generation Now!"""
36400,josh,"""In sleek Celia Yang slacks and a classic DKNY button-down, she's not afraid to bring a note of  'Let's do drinks after work' to the office."" "
36402,josh,"""But as much as we love her style, we worry about her inexperience and Bambi-esque naivete.  'There's so much to learn,' says Moss. 'I didn't even know there was a nuclear missile silo  under this place.'"""
36408,josh,"Let me take a guess at something. Jeff set you up with a reporter, right?"
36410,josh,"You probably didn't even bring this up, right? The girlfriend led you there?"
36412,josh,"As does pertain to Bambi. There's a reason why we keep these missile silos way out the hell  in the middle nowhere. It's 'cause they're working with some pretty nasty materials. Also,  there's not much point in keeping nuclear secrets from China when all they have to do is take  the free tour. Did it really sound right to you, when he said it? What'd you think, we'd go  to war, and Hercules rockets come flying out of the Rose Garden?"
36416,josh,"This is just like when I played the lead in ""Li'l Abner"" in eighth grade and rehearsals are  going fine. All of a sudden there's sets and lights and costumes, and everyone's tripping all  over themselves except me. You guys all walked into the building and got freaked by the lights.  I walked in and, you know, something else happened."
36418,josh,You all can try a little harder to be.
36420,josh,I should be sitting at my desk right now. Do I have a desk yet?
36422,josh,Okay. Then I'll just... walk around some more... see if I can get into a pickup meeting.
36425,toby,"Okay, but I-I don't know what you're talking about."
36427,toby,"See, I lent voice to thought and that was my mistake."
36430,toby,I think you have a different motivation.
36436,toby,"No, wha... uh... What's the matter with your white blood cells?"
36437,toby,"You don't have to sell me. It sounds like something we should try... But let me ask you  something, and bear in mind that I'm happy, I'm... eager to go to as many doctors as there  are... but should we talk about a stop date?"
36438,toby,"Yeah, we can talk about adopting."
36439,toby,"I meant adopting. I meant surrogacy. And yes, I love kids and I want them and I don't have  to have them. And I don't have to have them..."
36445,toby,I just said a stupid thing. What's the problem?
36446,c.j.,"Well, I did a one-on-one with Danny Concannon a few days ago on Rooker."
36447,toby,"Did you say, ""If you take a thorough look at Cornell Rooker's record...?"""
36448,c.j.,"Yes, as a matter of fact."
36452,c.j.,A DUI got fixed in law school. He doesn't want to write about the DUI as much as he wants to  write about us being the Capitol Clampettes. What was the stupid thing that you said?
36453,toby,Doesn't matter. Let's fix this.
36462,josh,"Listen, you probably don't want to let him know it's me on the phone. It's too intimidating.  It's like going out with Cher and Sonny calls."
36464,josh,So a radical feminist is saying women should stay home with the kids?
36465,josh,But everybody kills themself in Scandinavia.
36466,josh,"We need to defend our accomplishments on work and family, many of which you pushed for and show  that we get what working parents are going through. Can you help us?"
36467,josh,I'll call back. What would be a really bad time?
36472,josh,Does he have an appointment?
36476,josh,Donna says you're with the NSA.
36477,josh,"Yeah, but you wouldn't tell me of you were, right?"
36479,josh,"Yeah, look, the old guys were playing a joke on her. I realize it's not a good idea for a White  House staffer to be saying there's a missile in the capitol."
36481,josh,"""She hit a little close to home""?"
36482,josh,You trying to tell me...?
36484,josh,"Listen, this... this is silly. She was just duped. It was a joke."
36485,josh,This is a giant misunderstanding.
36486,josh,I would vouch for Donna with my life. She doesn't know about missiles. She's from Wisconsin!
36487,josh,"No, look, I'm sorry. I'm sure your intentions are good, and this is just routine, but it could  get tricky, and I'd like to have her talk to someone."
36489,josh,She's my assistant. For how long?
36495,josh,"That idiot interview you did, pooped a red flag at NSA. They're revoking your credentials  until it's straightened out."
36497,josh,I'm talking to someone in Cochran's office.
36499,josh,Take a few days off. Go home. Go to the beach.
36501,josh,"Well, then, I wouldn't go to the beach."
36503,josh,Don't worry about this. I'm going to fix this.
36504,c.j.,The President's not going to be available for a little bit.
36506,c.j.,Fitzwallace just got here.
36507,josh,Any idea what's going on? 
36508,josh,"All right. Listen up. We still have an open question on family, we still have an open question  on Rooker, missile defense, and vouchers. We start dress rehearsals tomorrow at 3:00. Let's  split up in our groups. I really want vouchers by 10:00, missile defense by 11:00."
36512,bartlet,Thanks for coming down.
36516,bartlet,They turn around the ship in exchange for what?
36518,bartlet,"They're arming the Bahji, Leo. Two training camps of which the Israelis just attacked.  I've gotta turn around the boat-- tonight. Tomorrow we'll worry about tomorrow."
36524,bartlet,What's available from the Sixth Fleet?
36525,bartlet,Stop the boat. Don't shoot it unless I tell you to.
36526,c.j.,"This doesn't feel food, does it? It's quiet, you know. It's too quiet."
36531,c.j.,"600,000 Evangelicals are praying for me... so... we have that going for us."
36533,c.j.,"It's true-- a guy gave me this card: ""365 in Media."""
36535,c.j.,"I don't know, let's see... ""Hugh Hefner, Don Imus, Howard Stern..."" all the late-night guys.  This is... one, two, three... this is the Editorial Board of The New York Times. This isn't a  good list, this is a list of people who are going to hell!"
36537,c.j.,They're not praying for me because they like me! It's 'cause I'm doomed to eternal damnation!
36539,c.j.,"You're on the list too, pal."
36542,josh,"We're going to do better for you, boss."
36548,josh,Can you walk with me a second?
36550,josh,"Well, you were right, I was wrong."
36552,josh,"Thanks. Listen, I got a weird problem."
36554,josh,"Remember Donna had lunch with Mack's assistant a few weeks ago? He told her there's a missile  silo on the grounds. She repeated it to a magazine and an NSA guy came to see me just now, and  said she struck a little close to home and they want to investigate. In the meantime, they've  revoked her credentials."
36556,josh,It means somehow she... There's actually some kind of weapons system right here on the White  House... or... intelligence gathering... Wait a minute. This doesn't sound right.
36559,josh,"It's going to be bambi, isn't it?"
36561,josh,I'm making phone calls.
36565,josh,"You'll never lose me, Amy."
36568,josh,That was it. We got it. We'll give it a test. I'll call you back. Probably around 1:00.
36570,josh,Let's get that in the form of an answer.
36571,c.j.,We got something from Amy.
36573,toby,I wasn't really wondering.
36574,josh,Why don't you just do your job as a man and get that nice girl pregnant.
36590,bartlet,Did you have a good day?
36592,bartlet,"You know what I remember he said to me? He said, ""Mr. President, when I hear black footsteps  behind me, I'm scared. When I hear white footsteps, I'm not."""
36594,bartlet,"You pay for these things for such a long time. Too long, don't you think?"
36596,bartlet,We made a mistake... I corrected it. I'll make more.
36598,bartlet,Am I going to lose New Hampshire?
36600,bartlet,"I don't mind blowing the knucklehead stuff like Rooker... Rooker's not knucklehead, but...  if I'm making mistakes there, how do I know I'm not doing it when it comes to matters like  death and destruction?"
36602,bartlet,"All right. When we're done tonight, we should talk about moving money to Ohio."
36604,bartlet,Not anymore. He's dead.
36607,bartlet,"And stay up in my face, okay?"
36609,bartlet,"I swear to God, the winner of this debate's going to be the next President. Anybody want  to be on the losing team?"
36610,bartlet,"Then let's pump it up. Let's go, Claudia Jean."
36611,c.j.,"Good evening, and welcome to the Presidential debate between President Josiah Bartlet and  Governor Robert Ritchie being brought to you from the Univerisity of California, San Diego.  The format agreed to by both candidates, is as follows: A candidate will have 90-seconds to  respond, followed with a 60-second questioning by his opponent, followed by 60-second  summation. By virtue of a coin toss, Mr. President, the first qestion goes to you."
36612,toby,A crisis of confidence?
36618,toby,"What-what... I don't... When I left him, he was ready. I don't understand. He's ready.  You can see it."
36620,toby,This isn't supposed to happen with you people.
36622,toby,"Yes. What happened to ""steady as she goes""?"
36626,toby,"All right, we still got a day and half before he debates. We'll go back to school."
36628,toby,What do you want to do?
36630,toby,Then what's the point of the two-minute drill?
36632,toby,This is crazy. I don't believe this.
36636,toby,"Listen, we're going to do something in the... in the drill right now."
36638,toby,"No notes, just positive reinforcement."
36640,toby,He has a problem this morning.
36647,josh,"I'm still looking for them, too."
36649,josh,We're going to expand the field.
36650,toby,"No notes during this drill.  That's you, too."
36652,toby,No notes during the drill.
36655,josh,There's pretty important feedback in the two-minute drills.
36656,toby,We've got four more. We've got one on the plane.
36657,c.j.,When is Debbie actually starting?
36659,toby,You know you've got a ten dollar bill in there on your clipboard.
36660,c.j.,Yeah. I owe it to someone.
36663,josh,"We don't have them yet, Mr. President."
36664,bartlet,"All right, let's do a drill."
36665,c.j.,"Mr. President, despite a rise in tension around the globe, you've held up funding for  a missile defense shield."
36666,bartlet,Too much money for too little protection.
36668,josh,"Sir, you oppose a voucher system that would offer children a choice of better schools..."
36669,bartlet,"That would offer some children a choice of better schools, but I haven't given up the  ghost on better schools for everybody, and vouchers drain money from that goal."
36670,toby,"Mr. President, this next question is on capital punishment, which you oppose: If your  youngest daughter Zoey was raped and murdered, would you not want to see the man  responsible put to death?"
36671,bartlet,"First of all, it's important to understand the President doesn't make that decision,  though he appoints the Supreme Court Justices who do so. What... any... um... All  right, I'm not going to say that. I'll just go right to... No, I don't. I think you  know that I'm opposed....  Let's not do that. I haven't seen any evidence that  it's a deterrent, and there are more effective... In my state... "
36674,toby," What's the matter with you? When I left  you... I just mentioned your daughter being murdered, and you're giving us an answer  that's not only soporific, it's barely human! Yes, you'd want to see him put to death.  You'd want it to be cruel and unusual, which is why it's probably a good idea that  fathers of murder victims don't have legal rights in these situations. Now, we're  going back to school."
36675,bartlet,Let's go-- ten bucks. Crisis of confidence.  You did one square foot of real  estate.
36677,bartlet,"Ten bucks for you.  And you-- You big bear, come to me. I'm going to kiss  you right on the mouth."
36683,josh, Sorry about that. It was the President idea. He bet us you couldn't stay quiet  if he gave a bad answer. What?
36727,c.j.,"All right, everyone. Thank you very much. Carol's passing out the playbooks. Senator,  we've put you on criminal justice, and Martin, we've moved you to welfare, if that's  okay."
36728,toby,"There's also some third party validator information in there, as well as the name of  the reporters you'll be handcuffed to. If it's not your thing, don't try to wing it.  Call somebody over."
36729,c.j.,Surrogate plans leaves at 9:00 this evening. We'll see you tomorrow for pre-game.
36730,toby,"C.J., could I see you? And I need Congresswoman Wyatt for just a moment."
36731,toby, Bennett's going to spin for Ritchie.
36732,c.j.,"I could have told you that was going to happen! Hang on -- no, wait -- I did!"
36733,toby,I find competitiveness so feminine in tall women.
36735,toby,"Yeah, on defense! What the hell...?"
36736,c.j.,"Don't huckle around with me right now, Phyllis! I got a North Carolina Democrat  shilling for Ritchie on defense. I've gotta get a guy. I need a Republican."
36737,toby,This is why I'm talking to you. You're going to use Albie Duncan.
36744,c.j.,Look at me. He's not a little bit crazy?
36747,toby,"No, no, no. A little bit."
36749,toby,He's going to be great. You'll see to it. Andy?
36750,c.j.,I'm crazy about the roundness of your head. 
36754,toby,That ship's sailed. Hey you want to know something? C.J. doesn't like running.
36755,toby,"Believe it or not, because it takes time away from helping. I really like that about  her, don't you?"
36756,toby,Good. Then marry me again.
36757,toby,All right. Let's make it interesting. Let's add incentive. The President wins the  debate tomorrow night and you marry me again.
36758,toby,"See, that's the difference between you and me. You're small-time. And that's why the  twins are gonna need their father around full-time. 'Cause your thing would be a  terrible trait. A terrible family trait to pass on to little... Beatrice and Bluto."
36759,toby,I need you to back up Albie Duncan.
36760,toby,"No, no, no. A little bit. No. Look, he's Albie Duncan. He was in the Eisenhower State  Department. He's brilliant, he's respected. He's a Republican. If he's crazy, then I  don't want to be sane."
36800,bartlet,"No, I decided to go ahead and wear my lucky tie."
36802,bartlet,"Then it's your lucky tie. Why don't you get mine, and we'll go to the plane?"
36803,bartlet,"Listen, what do you say I sit in on this meeting for a few minutes. We've got time."
36812,josh,"Ten words. Let me try two on you. Defense: ""I will make America's defenses the strongest  in the history of the world."""
36814,josh,"Crime: ""Some crimes are so heinous, so hateful to American values that we ought to lock  prisoners up and throw away the key."" Please don't say yes to that one."
36816,josh,You read Gabriel Tillman's speech at the Stanford Club?
36818,josh,Governor of California's got a new writing staff.
36822,josh,We're going to make you proud. Sit back and enjoy it.
36846,c.j.,Thanks so much for helping us out.
36847,c.j.,Have you ever seen the Moscow Circus?
36848,c.j.,Then I really have no point of reference to describe what a post debate spin room  is like.
36849,c.j.,Thank you very much. What happens is you'll be taken into the room and a volunteer  will walk in behind you holding up a large sign with your name on it and the press  will surround you.
36850,c.j.,Absolutely not. Don't even hope. They're going to want you to talk about why is a  Republican spinning for the President. Nobody's expecting you to say a thing-not a  thing-that would embarrass the party to which you've been a loyal and active member  your entire life. He'll be attacked during the debate on China. He'll have to defend  his trade goals versus human rights violations.
36851,c.j.,That's it. It's that simple.
36854,c.j.,"No, no, he's the ten-word. And believe me he hates it."
36855,c.j.,"Yeah, but the thing is Ritchie's good at it and we just need to show we have that club  in our bag. That's all."
36856,c.j.,According to the best people who've analyzed specific polling data there may a million  undecideds out there who'd come to Bartlet if he displayed one or two qualities that  were more like Ritchie. And we chose this. So for 90 seconds tonight the mountain will  come to Mohammed and we'll pretend the whole thing never happened.
36860,c.j.,"Okay, but I wouldn't say that tonight."
36861,c.j.,"Nor, if it were I, would I say that."
36862,c.j.,"Still, I think the first answer's our winner. So, can I find an attractive aide and  have her bring you some Schweppe's Bitter Lemon?"
36868,josh,"Well if we lose because of a ten-word answer, then I'm quitting show business.  "
36870,c.j.,"I think it depends who shows up. If it's Uncle Fluffy, we've got problems. If it's the  President, in his last campaign, his last debate, for the last job he'll ever have...  if the President shows up, I think it'll be a sight to see, I mean a sight to see.  What do you think?"
36871,toby,I think you're going to enjoy yourself tonight.
36877,bartlet,I guess what I don't understand is this. Have I ever exhibited any evidence that I'd  be mad if a tie got ruined?
36879,bartlet,The chemicals at the Dry cleaner don't know that.
36881,josh,"Yeah. Guys, we're going to give them the room now."
36885,toby,I just assumed you wanted to include me. 
36889,bartlet,"Well, I don't approve of that."
36891,bartlet,"I don't approve of that, either. Remember the tie Josh had to give me at the last minute?"
36893,bartlet,There was a lot of juice in that tie. It was like in the last seconds. Just the energy  getting me out on stage...
36899,bartlet,Why are you telling me this now?
36901,bartlet,"Oh, my God. You're insane. Are you...? You're insane! Charlie!"
36904,bartlet,My wife cut it off with scissors.
36906,bartlet,"I don't think we have that kind of time, Josh."
36907,c.j.,No one's done camera test...
36908,toby,She's right. Let's run some.
36912,bartlet," Well, first of all, let's clear up a couple of things. ""Unfunded mandate"" is two  words, not one ""big word."" "
36913,bartlet," There are times when we're fifty states and there are times when we're one  country, and have national needs. And the way I know this is that Florida didn't fight  Germany in World War II or establish civil rights. You think states should do the  governing wall-to-wall. That's a perfectly valid opinion. But your state of Florida got  $12.6 billion in federal money last year-- from Nebraskans, and Virginians, and New  Yorkers, and Alaskans, with their Eskimo poetry. 12.6 out of a state budget of $50  billion, and I'm supposed to be using this time for a question, so here it is: Can we  have it back, please?"
36917,c.j., It's not going to be Uncle Fluffy.
36919,bartlet,"Actually, what you've done in Florida is bring the right together with the far right.  And I don't think Americans are tired of partisan politics; I think they're tired of  hearing career politicians diss partisan politics to get a gig. I've tried it before,  they ain't buying it. That's okay, though. That's okay, though, 'cause partisan  politics is good. Partisan politics is what the founders had in mind. It guarantees  that the minority opinion is heard, and as a lifelong possessor of minority opinions,  I appreciate it. But if you're troubled by it, Governor, you should know, in this  campaign, you've used the word ""liberal"" seventy-four times in one day. It was yesterday."
36920,toby," I'm not sure I can watch anymore. No, wait, I can. I can."
36926,bartlet," No, the question is: Should we focus on 90% of the kids, who go to public school,  or give parents money from the public-school budget to send their kids to private school  at a time when private schools are even turning kids away who can afford it? Public  schools are going to be the best schools in the country. They're gonna be cathedrals.  The answer is a change in the way we finance schools!"
36930,bartlet," That's the ten-word answer my staff's been looking for for two weeks. There it  is. Ten-word answers can kill you in political campaigns. They're the tip of the sword.  Here's my question: What are the next ten words of your answer? Your taxes are too high?  So are mine. Give me the next ten words. How are we going to do it? Give me ten after  that, I'll drop out of the race right now. Every once in a while... every once in a  while, there's a day with an absolute right and an absolute wrong, but those days almost  always include body counts. Other than that, there aren't very many unnuanced moments  in leading a country that's way too big for ten words. I'm the President of the United  States, not the President of the people who agree with me. And by the way, if the left  has a problem with that, they should vote for somebody else."
36931,c.j.," I'm going to make a bold suggestion, but  hear me out. Let's not spin. Let's leave the room. We'll use the experts, but nobody  from the campaign, nobody from the White House, and definitely not us."
36933,c.j.,"There's nothing left to do here, and it's inelegant. It's the punch Ali never gave  Foreman when he was going down."
36935,josh,"All right, just a statement. The President's on his way to Washington to get back to  work."
36939,c.j.,I have a question. Isn't there a decent chance you and the President are wrong?
36940,c.j.,"I mean, doesn't he also know that Chinese political dissidents are going to be sewing  soccer balls together with their teeth whether or we sell them cheeseburgers or not?  I mention this because the President just reminded us that complexity isn't a vice. "
36941,c.j.,"You're the one I like, too. "
37004,josh,"No, you can't vote for him in two columns."
37005,josh,You're ballots going to be invalidated.
37006,josh,You're only allowed to vote once.
37007,josh,He's on the ballot more than that. He's on the ballot as the Liberal Party nominee...
37008,josh,"Me, too, and I'm saying yours is a vote we didn't get."
37009,josh,"No. No, uh, you can vote for the President in whatever column you want, but you can only vote once."
37011,josh,Yes. No. It doesn't... You can't vote for a party. You have to vote for a person.
37013,josh,"Well, then you voted for none but one candidate."
37014,josh,Did you vote for the President? Was the Presidnet the one box?
37015,josh,It was a minute and a half ago.
37016,josh,I'm sorry. Thank you for voting.
37021,josh,Just part of the job ma'am.
37022,josh,"Well, I'm just worried 'cause they all tried to vote for Bartlet, and if this keeps up, we're  headed towards biggest electoral upset in history and nobody's going to be able to figure out why."
37024,josh,No. Listen to me. Your ballot is invalid.  So is yours. Punch the box  next to the candidate you prefer once-- nothing else.
37028,josh,"I see. You guys are a little troupe. A little acting troupe with a ""U""."
37030,josh,"As a matter of fact, that would be nice."
37035,c.j.,"Okay, but we're using the seal and I'll put Senate and House leadership up there."
37042,c.j.,"On your birthday, don't we pander to you?"
37045,c.j.,What are you babbling about?
37046,toby,We haven't won anything yet.
37050,toby,"I've got a speech if he wins, I've got a speech if he doesn't."
37052,toby,Of course I wrote a concession. You want to tempt the wrath of the whatever from high atop the thing?
37054,toby,"Then go outside, turn around three times and spit. What the hell's the matter with you?"
37058,c.j.," Oh, Mr. Lyman. I see your picture in the magazine. Tell me, if I swallow  my ballot, does it still...?"
37059,josh,A little election day humor-- that's great.
37061,josh,Of course he wrote a concession speech. Why wouldn't he? What possible reason would he have  for not writing a concession speech?
37063,toby,He upped and said we were gonna...
37064,josh,"No, you got to go outside, turn around three times and curse."
37072,josh,These things have a half-life. You just can't...
37073,toby,"All right, we're meeting again, when?"
37074,toby,11:00 unless there's a reason earlier.
37075,c.j., Can I have you two seconds?
37076,toby,Yeah. What do you need?
37082,c.j.,"Listen, I know better then to stick my face in your personal life except, you know, for sport."
37084,c.j.,Roll Call's got it from the Office of Congress's Attending Physician that Andy's pregnant.
37085,toby,When did they start doing more than flu vaccinations?
37086,c.j.,They need updated medical records.
37087,toby,"Roll Call doesn't need updated medical records though, do they?"
37088,c.j.,They're going to connect the dots. It's going to be bad for her and bad for you.
37090,c.j.,"I can handle the ""us."" What's her plan?"
37093,toby,I dont know. We haven't talked about it.
37094,c.j.,She's got to be proactive.
37096,c.j.,It would be nice if we could announce a wedding.
37097,toby,I'm working on that. Thanks.
37098,c.j.,"You'll talk to her, hmm?"
37130,bartlet,Better than if I won my home state but lost my home country. The only poll that matters closes  in 17 hours.
37131,bartlet,"Title 63, Chapter 659, Section 43 of New Hampshire election code says electioneering is prohibited  within a corridor ten feet wide and extending a distance from the entrance door of the building as  determined by the moderator where the election is being held. If anyone knows what that means..."
37132,bartlet,"Yeah, I voted for the bond issue. It's going to improve public education without a tax abatement."
37133,bartlet,"Well, one way or another I imagine we'll be talking tonight. I got to get back. You can hockle  Abbey for awhile. She's taking the next plane."
37134,bartlet,"Yeah. Listen, you think you could score me a couple of aspirin?"
37136,bartlet,"No, it's just a headache. Just me and you today, okay. I'm fine."
37137,bartlet,I'll sign these in the car.
37139,bartlet,"Okay, this can wait. Let's go."
37140,josh,"Nothing's happening right bow. By the end of the night, 100 million votes will be cast. Polls  have been open in the East for six and a half hours. You know how many votes have been cast?  One percent. Everybody votes after work. Not me, I vote first thing. The VNS exit polls are  down in Michigan for a little while. And it's raining Oregon. This is like the ionization  blackout period."
37152,josh,Toby already did the thing this morning with the invalid ballots.
37160,josh,"Yeah, your ""picking the winner"" streak is probably over."
37162,josh,"Almost. That's almost what you did. What you did was draw a line through the Republican ticket.  You didn't ticket split, you voted for every Republican in Wisconsin. I would check, you may  have voted for McCarthy."
37168,josh,I'm going in. You still want me to have him...?
37170,josh,"Hey, I'm going in, okay?"
37173,josh,How do you know I don't have it?
37175,josh,I got it. I read it. It was good stuff. It's possible the salient details escape me.
37176,josh,That's a fair point and next time I'm going to remember the memo.
37177,josh,You want me to go back to my office and get it?
37178,josh,Okay. All right. I'm going to humor the new girl.
37181,josh,"Uh... He, should, uh...  You should play football."
37183,josh,"Rule Number Two- Daily Senior Staff will... something the briefing memo. I have the briefing  memo, I'm going in."
37185,josh,The salients details...
37187,josh,There has to be a natural fluidity to these things. It's how we work best. You can't say  that every meeting has to...
37188,josh,"Well, I think that's a random cracking of the whip."
37189,josh,"Okay. Well, yes that's hard to argue against and I'll remember this talk the next time."
37190,josh,"Okay, well, I'm going in now, all right?"
37191,josh,All right. This is your little part of the store and I respect that. See what I did there?  Respect. No one's bigger than the game.
37200,josh,And you think it's going to take about 20 minutes?
37204,josh,"Ooh, big needle. 18 inches. Right in the stomach, Toby. Don't look directly at it."
37206,josh,"Not me personally. Toby, when you get there, it's a good idea to slip the nurse something.  Tell her you're hoping for a smooth second trimester."
37207,toby,"He's kidding. Give me one second, would you? I'll catch right up."
37208,toby," Yes. So what do you think, like 50 bucks?"
37209,josh,"I don't know. It's your first, it's twins... I don't know. I think I'd give her $100."
37211,josh,In your life you have never been on time to this meeting.
37213,josh,"Well, that's the trick, then."
37215,josh,That name sounds familiar.
37221,josh,California 47th. He was the guy running Horton Wilde?
37223,josh,"Yeah, they're going to lose that by 20 points."
37239,josh,"Hey, when I said ""exits"" before, I meant ""tracking"". And I'm pretty sure they did the last  one about a week ago and then left town."
37247,toby,Roll Call has the pregnancy.
37248,toby,Roll Call has the pregnancy. C.J. just told me.
37250,toby,I didn't want to ruin the day for you.
37252,toby,What are you saying that to me for?
37253,toby,"Just out of curiosity, how long did you think this was going to be covert? These are twins, Andy.  You think you're going to go on Meet the Press and Russerts not going to notice you're the size of  a school? Why not just come out and say ""I'm expecting twins. I couldn't be happier. The father's  my ex-husband, Toby Ziegler, to whom I'll be remarried on a date to be decided upon. I'm thinking  Christmas."""
37254,toby,Then say the first part at least.
37255,toby,"These bodies of yours, I don't know how you live with them."
37258,toby,"You should draft a release. In fact, let that be my first act of fatherhood-- drafting your  release. Go back to my roots as we all must go. And now you're on offense and not defense."
37259,toby,"The things we do in our lives, many of them are not voluntary."
37260,toby,"Yes, indeed. So let my second act be throwing you a little press conference."
37261,toby,Do I need to tell you the first rule of damage control?
37262,toby,"Get the information out early, get it out yourself, do it on your own terms."
37263,toby,"Andy, look. I'm not kidding. You've got... "
37267,toby,"Andy, you-you can see their... heads. My kids have heads."
37282,josh,"Yeah, yeah, Josh was talking about that before. Apparently all his other problems are solved."
37305,bartlet,Hello. Hi. What's going on?
37306,bartlet,What was wrong with the old way?
37307,bartlet,What was wrong with the old way?
37309,bartlet,I hear you've got rules for meetings.
37310,bartlet,"You don't think that's apt to create a resentment among the people who were here before with...?  It's not like the thing wasn't working with... Whatever you may assume, that wasn't a rube  sitting out there, Debbie. She ran the Oval Office for two years and a state house before that."
37311,bartlet,"What if, instead of you, I want a dial tone?"
37313,bartlet,You're going to place a lot of my outgoing calls...
37314,bartlet,I can make my own phone call. Don't be...
37315,bartlet,I can make my own phone calls.
37316,bartlet,That's good. That's a good idea.
37319,bartlet,Debbie... I have to ask you. Are we talking about...? Did you bring it up 'cause you...  noticed...? Is there some particular thing today you noticed?
37320,bartlet,"No, please. I was talking about something else. Line one is you?"
37352,josh,"See, now there are late exits showing even with white male suburbans in New York and Chicago  and Philadelphia. There's huge labor turnout. We're only losing Florida by seven-- seven.  Toby, I think this is going to be bigger than we thought."
37353,toby,"I stare at this and I stare at this and I don't know which is the boy and which is the girl.  I suppose that problem will take care of itself. You know, if you stare at them for awhile,  well, it's pretty gross, but still..."
37354,josh,"Okay, I'm concerned that you've turned completely into another person."
37355,toby,Hey. I see one victory ballon before this thing is called and...!
37356,toby,"Yeah, you better run!  Huh?"
37362,josh,It's on. You can see it.
37363,toby,I'm not spitting. I'm not turning around. Union households are beating non-unions in some  of these districts..
37366,c.j.,You'll see in a minute. 
37367,c.j.,"Good evening, Mr. President."
37368,bartlet,"I feel like I should be self-deprecating. I mean, it's not inauguration. I could be funny,  right? I don't thibk so. I think it's the wrong note. If I'm thanking campaign staff, maybe. "
37374,bartlet,"Halfway aroung the world in Bosnia and Chechnya and Rwanda, they dream of the promise we  fulfilled today of a future we chose, for ourelves, together."
37377,bartlet,"Four years ago, we were joined by our highest ideals, by our best hopes, and tonight we're  joined by the same commitment to open new doors of oppurtunity and justice. "
37378,bartlet,"To ensure that the promise of the country is the birthright of all the people. We've achieved  so much together always believing, always knowing that America could be made new again and so  it was, and so it will be again. God bless you all. God bless the United States of America."
37379,josh,We're going to skip the parties for a while and head back to the office. There are nine House  races too close to call. Tell him about California.
37380,toby,In the California 47th...
37381,josh,"In the 47th-- You don't tell it well. In the 47th, Horton Wilde, who's dead, is losing by 88 votes.  It was a perfect storm."
37383,josh,"Low Republican turnout, 'cause the President won he Midwest. Low supporter turnout 'cause Webb  didn't have an opponent and the DNC gave up on it a week ago so the RNC left town and they never  saw the exits your guy Will Bailey was seeing."
37384,toby,Plus there was an actual storm. I tell it fine.
37385,josh,"Anyway, we're going to be up all night with these. It's going to be fun."
37398,bartlet,Just for a minute at the end. I couldn't see it.
37400,bartlet,"Yeah, I know. We can still have tonight, though, right?"
37403,c.j.,Excuse me. You want to take another curtain call?
37429,c.j.,"Josh, Sam Donaldson from the ABC Nightly News program's on the phone. He'd like to know if  the President is endorsing Sam."
37430,josh,"Toby, is the President endorsing Sam? Hmm? Is the President endorsing Sam?"
37431,toby,"I don't know. He's asleep, but let's go ask him."
37438,toby,You did it for the widow.
37440,c.j.,I would actually talk to the President first.
37442,c.j.,"He's going to get it first thing in the morning. There's a seat in play. He's going to be  asked about it and he can't say, you know, ""My God, I have no earthly idea what you're  talking about."""
37444,bartlet,"I don't want to intimidate you, but it turns out I'm the first Democrat in twenty years to  make a clean sweep of the Plains states and I'm not just talking about Iowa and Nebraska."
37448,bartlet,"I won the Dakotas. The Badlands. The Black Hills. But let's go down, way down, to the Deep  South and the humid bayou of Louisiana and its nine electoral votes. What manner of man it  must take to win the state, which, by the way, is the only one operating under the Napoleonic  Code of France and I still don't know what that's all about, but back to me..."
37450,bartlet,Who's your Commander in Chief?
37452,bartlet,"Yes. And do the ladies like him? Oh, yes. To the tune of 58%. "
37454,bartlet,"I thought we had an understanding with regard to tonight and interruptions, Charlie.  I thought we were men. "
37456,bartlet,"It's like what, 1:00 in the morning? "
37457,bartlet,"Well, let's send him in."
37461,bartlet,"No, what would make you say that?"
37463,bartlet,"No, no, you could have and I'm not going to take any chances, so let's do it now."
37471,bartlet,"Then, I'm behind you 100%."
37473,bartlet,"Man, is everything all right?"
37478,bartlet,"Yeah, look, honey, Sam stopped by."
37493,toby,Yeah. Any idea where Mama is? 
37494,toby,"Andy! Andy, don't drink that..."
37495,toby,"Yeah, okay, ginger ale can be bad according to the latest studies. It can be very..."
37496,toby,That was very pleasant. Can I talk to you for a second?
37497,toby,You won by 85% of the vote.
37498,toby,"Yeah, well, as long as you scraped by with a win. Look, a-a statement."
37499,toby,Roll Call has it. that's why we have to deal with it.
37500,toby,"Congresswoman Wyatt, are you pregnant?"
37501,toby,You can't withhold that from your constituents.
37502,toby,"Yeah, did you hear the rumour that there was a Congressional investigation and it almost  detonated his Presidency?"
37503,toby,I'm not worried about you.
37504,toby,"Yeah, you know what? Single moms are a lot more sympathetic than deadbeat dads, so I  wouldn't gallivant."
37505,toby,"I know that, and you know that, but if I can't protect my kids, their mom, and the President  all at the same time, then I've got to quit my job, so can you help me out?"
37506,toby,You'll make a statement?
37508,toby,Eighty-five percent of what kind of backward population votes for this woman?
37520,c.j.,"Shh. Hey, hey, hey, with the singing of the song!"
37521,c.j.,Does anyone know who this is?
37522,josh,I don't... I think he won the election.
37523,c.j.,It sounds like he did very well.
37524,josh,It is. He's a pollster.
37525,c.j.,Excuse me. Don't break things.
37529,c.j.,You know a guy named Chris Whitaker?
37533,c.j.,He was just on TV claiming credit for your energy strategy.
37534,c.j.,He's claming credit for the energy strategy and who knows what else.
37536,c.j.,I think you should talk to some reporters. You are entitled to the status you've earned.
37537,c.j.,I'm going to be watching this guy.
37539,c.j.,I'm going to be watching this guy.
37543,c.j.,You might want to tell Josh that a few carlaods of women...
37546,josh,Hang on. A couple people from the Womens Leadersip Coalition just... 
37550,josh,How you doing on the night?
37551,josh,"So the guys at Lexington and Concord, they didn't die in vain."
37552,josh,"Want to hear the funniest thing? A week ago, Sam told Horton Wilde's widow that he'd run  in his place."
37554,josh,"All these events conspired to... like the DNC gave up on the race so the RNC left town,  leaving no one to read the exits..."
37555,josh,I can do it. The President won the Midwest and there was depressed Republican turnout in  the district 'casue it was never a race...
37556,josh,I keep hearing that name.
37557,josh,"For a dead candidate, of course you did. Anyway, Sam's desperately trying to get ahold  of the widow so he can have the worst conversation of his life. He's... just going to  have to say..."
37560,josh,"Angry House Democrats. I'm shivering, hold my hand."
37561,josh,"You know what, the President's coattails were long enough to elect a Democrat out of Orange  County with literally no pulse. Any Congressman complaining..."
37564,josh,"All right, give me your coat."
37566,josh,"Okay, your coat will be here."
37570,josh,I felt you lurking. I want to try to find a guy named Will Bailey with the Wilde campaign  in Newpport Beach.
37584,josh,I want to talk to you for a minute about Sam. 
37586,josh,"I-I understand completely, Will. "
37588,josh,Let me just ask you this: What are the President's unfavorables in the 47th? 
37590,josh,I'm trying to get a sense of what happens when Sam gets tagged with Bartlet fatigue. 
37594,josh,"I just assumed 'cause most operatives can recite that kind of thing, you know, at the  upper levels. "
37599,josh,Can you find Leo for me?
37637,toby,"""My ex-husband, Toby Ziegler, and I are expecting twins in May. We thank you for your good  wishes and ask for privacy while we consider... reconciliation."" Two sentences."
37641,toby,"Oh, what is the problem?"
37642,toby,I didn't raise my voice.
37644,toby,"Fourteenth Amendment protects you from state action, and not the media, who, by the way,  have their own Amendment."
37645,toby,"First of all, three of those guys are outstanding Congressmen. Second of all their  constituents knew they were eighty when they voted for them."
37646,toby,The people who elected you aren't the ones who are going to throw the picnic.
37647,toby,Then what's the problem?
37648,toby,You're not trying to avoid a fight.
37649,toby,You're looking for one.
37650,toby,You're sniffing around for a fight.
37651,toby,Not sniffing around for one as much as... trying to create one. Trying to create trouble  where none existed.
37652,toby,"Well, I can admire that."
37654,toby,I came up with a plan to tell them apart in the initial months.
37655,toby,"Oh, Okay. I was going to hang little signs around their necks."
37659,c.j.,Wouldn't you just give anything if she was from Tibet?
37661,c.j.,It's going to be the start of a press tour.
37662,c.j.,I'm going to leak some internal campaign memos.
37663,c.j.,I don't care. We can...
37664,c.j.,I know how to do this. I can end a process story and correct the record at the same time.
37666,c.j.,"In a poll taken three days after the MS announcement, the President lost to Ritchie by  nine points. He won by 11. You did it."
37667,c.j.,"Okay. Hey... if you want to come back to my office, there's an actual still."
37669,josh,"Listen, can I talk to you for a minute?"
37671,josh,"I've been talking to a few people, and... I-I don't know, I think maybe Sam should run."
37672,c.j.,"I've been thinking about that, too."
37673,josh,When the dust settles what's the story going to be?
37674,c.j.,That we didn't take back the House.
37675,josh,"Yeah, like that was our fault. These people make me crazy. ""He-he didn't do enough down-ticket  campaigning."" You have any idea how much gumbo that man ate?"
37676,c.j.,I don't think running for Congress is the thing you do to change the story.
37677,josh,"I know, but there are real reasons. We give Democrats in the 47th something to get excited  about."
37678,c.j.,You think he should run?
37679,josh,What are you doing here?
37683,toby,I bet against a Puerto Rican for Bronx Borough President. I deserve to lose.
37684,josh,Does the U.S. Attorney's Office know about you?
37685,josh,Can we talk to you for a minute?
37686,toby,"Actually, I'm going to, uh, talk to the President and First Lady. Can it wait?"
37687,c.j.,You going to tell them?
37690,toby,"No. They're still up, right?"
37692,josh,I think he should do it.
37706,bartlet,"As you can see, we've moved on to the caviar course."
37708,bartlet,"I know how you do. Stoli Cristall, the most elegant of vodkas."
37709,bartlet,The caviar itself is a product of my advice at the Convention on International Trade in  Endangered Species. We passed a much more stringent bill against the poaching of Caspian  Sea sturgeons.
37711,bartlet,California white sturgeon from the Stillman Sea Farm in Elverta. Only the best.
37713,bartlet,"Oh, I think you're going to find..."
37717,bartlet,"Yeah. You're young, Charlie. Don't you want to be having fun right now? "
37729,bartlet,"Yeah. Well, we kind of knew it was going to be like this."
37733,bartlet,"All right, have a good night."
37739,toby,"Good evening, Mrs. Bartlet. That's a lovely housecoat you're wearing."
37741,bartlet,"Listen, I'm kind of in the middle of something. Is this anything that could possibly wait  until tomorrow?"
37742,toby,"Of course it is, Mr. President. I'm sorry. Really, I stopped by 'cause I hadn't told you  that Andy's pregnant. It's twins, and of course, I'm the father."
37743,bartlet,"Well, that's great. Well done. See you tomorrow."
37746,bartlet,(to Toby) I was this close.
37748,toby,"Yeah, it's, uh, twins. A boy and a, um, uh, a girl."
37750,bartlet,"You should marry that girl, Toby."
37751,toby,"I'm doing my best, sir."
37753,toby,End of May. I have a picture.
37754,bartlet,Wait a second. End of may? 
37756,bartlet,"Hang on, I'm doing math in my head. Yeah, end of May? Why didn't you tell us until now?"
37758,bartlet,"Yeah, but he's got one."
37759,toby,"The truth is, I don't, sir. At least not a good one. I was intimidated by your Catholicism."
37762,bartlet,"It's my Catholicism, Toby. It works for me."
37764,bartlet,And her. Did you break any laws?
37766,bartlet,"Then a blessing on your house, young man. Mazel tov."
37767,toby,"Thank you, sir. Thank you, ma'am."
37772,c.j.,"Excuse me. Chris Whitaker, right?"
37773,c.j.,"Thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you."
37774,c.j.,"No, please. We're all impressed with how influential you were, particularly when you consider  that most of us have never met you. But what I'm most grateful for is the process story,  which takes attention from the debate, and focuses it where it belongs, which is the contest.  This is the story everyone'll be clamouring for and I like that you're filling that need.  And to show my gratitude, I'm calling all the major news outlets and letting them know that  I'll be forwarding all your confidential memos to the President, logs of all your calls with  him, Secret Service logs of your meetings inside the White House."
37775,c.j.,Don't disrespect Leo McGarry and Bruno Gianelli.
37778,c.j.,We need to talk to you.
37780,c.j.,We think you should run.
37782,c.j.,"Well, it was Josh's idea."
37783,josh,"Actually, it was Amy's."
37786,josh,I think you'd energize the state party. We're not going to let you look like a fool.  We won't allow it.
37788,toby,"I don't think you should do it. Energizing the state party's good. A well-funded airing of  the issues is good. So is mollifying House Democrats, but you have to ask yourself, is it  worth it? You're going to lose. A Democrat's always loses in the 47th. Can't just pick up  and try someplace else. They have a name for that."
37790,toby,Then I think you should win.
37803,c.j.,"Mr. President, how do you interpret the margin of victory?"
37804,bartlet,"Well, the votes have been counted and the people have spoken, and it's clear that  their will is for me to be able to do and have anything I want."
37805,c.j.,"Mr. President, Arnold White, Associated Press: What's the first legislative priority  for your second term?"
37806,bartlet,There's a new guy from AP?
37807,c.j.,"Yeah, what's your legislative priority?"
37808,bartlet,"Well the President of Turkmenistan just officially extended the date of adolescence  to twenty-five. So, things like that."
37810,bartlet,That's just greedy. Real power is knowing when to leave a little something on  the table.
37811,c.j.,"Sir, what legislative..."
37812,c.j.,"Okay, sir. I asked you for a legislative priority, you gave me nine."
37813,bartlet,"It's a big country, Arnold. Debbie! Where the hell, first of all, are you and where  are my..."
37814,bartlet,"Ipswich clams don't come from Chesapeake Bay, they come from Ipswich!"
37815,bartlet,Have her beheaded for my birthday!
37818,toby,They'll ask you how you feel about housing starts going down.
37821,bartlet,As long as I'm keeping this one.
37823,bartlet,"You bet your ass it is. Which, by the way, I can pat anytime I want now. The voters  have spoken. Lowest inflation in twenty years. Housing starts are cyclical, which is  the thing.  What do you got?"
37846,bartlet," Don't get me wrong, Mark. I think January's a good month..."
37852,josh,"Yeah, I'm pretty sure I ate a Springer Spaniel. Why is AP on my phone sheet?"
37853,toby,'Cause Triplehorn told him you are the reason there won't be a deal in prescription  drugs.
37855,toby," ""...with Lyman negotiating..."" Yeah."
37856,josh,I'm starting to feel ill-will toward the minority leader.
37857,toby,And I've had it up to here with the Welsh.
37858,josh,"I'm not kidding. He was campaining with us, like, a half hour ago."
37859,toby,School's back. Go see him.
37860,josh,"Let's call tht plan ""A"". Plan ""B"" is you go see him."
37862,josh,And National Parks screws me up again.
37864,josh, I'm going to head up to the Leaders Office. See if you can get me the  first three minutes he has.
37866,josh,"Let's do this: find out what her problem is, solve it and then, I don't know, do  something else."
37868,josh,"Yeah? You're the reason...  Nothing, nothing's happening, nothing's there."
37872,toby,"Yeah, I've had extensive education. What was the final... margin?"
37873,toby,A hundred and twenty-seven.
37874,toby,Wasn't your last election also...?
37875,toby,"The President says all you need is one, the rest are for ego."
37876,toby,About three and a half million. 
37877,toby,"He's got a pretty healthy ego, though."
37878,toby,I like hotels. I like a good concierge.
37880,toby,The President thinks there's a place for you.
37881,toby,Huh. We were thinking the same thing.
37883,toby,The Director of the National Parks Service.
37887,toby,Then get yourself a big hat and Leo's gonna call you in couple of hours.
37889,toby,All's well that ends well.
37892,c.j.,National Parks Chairman?
37896,c.j.,I think Andy's about to get sued for election fraud.
37897,toby,Andy was trying to get sued for election fraud.
37900,c.j.,"Before I forget, Susan, Karnow and Duffy, are the first three for tea with the  President at 3:00 P.M. in the Map Room. Susan, Karnow and Duffy. Next week it's  Mark, Leslie and Eric."
37901,c.j.,Sam's putting his team together and I'm going to start referring those questions to  the campaigns press office. Let's start with John then Katie.
37944,bartlet,"Yeah? It's called penmanship, Watson. Something your generation wouldn't know about  because of the computers. How many of these things am I doing?"
37947,bartlet,Your system's slowing me down.
37950,bartlet,"Hey, can't we have color coding and stickers priority list? Can I get a little  bureaucracy going here?"
37952,bartlet,"I'm doing basically what the President does. Ask people for things, then thank them  for things. Let's go.  Take the calls to the mansion. I'll meet you there  after this."
37953,bartlet,We had a couple of cats when the kids were kids named Mr. Finch and Ms. Wilburforce or  something-- I can't remember-- but...
37957,bartlet,"Okay, well, I can't believe my kids didn't think to ask you what to name the cats.  But they used to bring mice into the house and show 'em to me."
37959,bartlet,This is how I'm starting to feel about the Swiss.
37964,bartlet,That's eleven minutes from now.
37965,bartlet,"This meeting's a little premature, isn't it? We should wait ten minutes."
37966,bartlet,"This meeting doesn't go in the Sit Room anymore, okay? I don't know why the hell it's  here. This isn't a military operation."
37968,bartlet,"My office is a secure room, too, isn't it? Please, somebody tell me it is, or I gotta  go pack some stuff. You see my point?"
37970,bartlet,"I'm sorry, that sounded funny to me. I'm the kid in bio who laughed all the time."
37978,bartlet,"Fifteen. The Shiites, Manny, that's what you want me to take back to my thoracic-surgeon  wife? Get this boy in preop. Somebody tell the Swiss to stop standing in the damn  doorway with a mouse in their mouth. If they're coming in, come in."
37979,bartlet,"No, 'cause we're all in a secure room except for the Ayatollah's staff, a Swissair  pilot, and four hundred other people."
37982,bartlet,"Mr. Finch and Mrs. Wilberforce. There's nothing wrong with my memory. Though those  are stupid names, and there's something wrong with my kids."
37983,josh,"You know, the Senate's out of session. You ought to think about putting a Ping-Pong  table out here."
37984,josh,A couple of quick rounds between cloture motions.
37986,josh,Just from reading the AP wire.
37987,josh,"Yeah, you're running for President."
37988,josh,I'm not saying any different.
37989,josh,They're locked...? You're recruiting precint captains 48 months before the next election?
37990,josh,If you're saying there's a full-blown nomination fight...
37991,josh,Nothing's being dragged anywhere. You were with us just days ago.
37992,josh,"Yeah, how about we enjoy the present for a few hours?"
37993,josh,"Look, Hoynes is... Did I just fall asleep for three and half years?"
37995,josh,"Okay, I'm not for anyone. I barely unpacked from the last campaign."
37996,josh,"It keeps getting earlier, doesn't it?"
38001,toby,Josh is patching it up with Triplehorn. And Karen Kroft wants National Parks.
38003,toby,What are you talking about?
38005,toby,We talked about it in the appointments meeting.
38007,toby,"Yeah, that was for next fiscal year."
38009,toby,Who's idea? How did we miss this?
38011,toby,Maybe we put her up anyway.
38019,toby,Don't. Would you... I need a list of sub-cabinets vacancies that aren't Senate- confirmable.
38020,toby,A little less sub-cabinet that that.
38021,bartlet,"No kidding, you want to crash a space probe into Neptune. That's fine with me. I think  we've crashed into most of the planets but $2.5 billion, okay? "
38022,bartlet,"If we're going to fail, I want to do it on budget. "
38023,bartlet,You know what? Why don't you tell Debbie we're going to do some calls?
38024,bartlet,"Yes, calls. Calls. Mr. Sarcasm, with your dry... ""Calls."" I was this close to renaming  one of the oceans after you but no way. Maybe... maybe, one of the species of fish,  like trout.  ""Trout"" is now 'charlie.' Went up to the lake, pulled out a  couple of nice charlie for dinner."
38025,bartlet,Look at the size of that charlie you've got mounted on your wall!
38027,c.j.,"Yeah, we've got a situation."
38029,c.j.,Rueters has the Ayatollah's son youngest son just left Afghanistan on a C-130. Is he  coming here for a heart transplant?
38031,c.j.,I'm assuming we knew about this.
38032,bartlet,Knew about it? We did it.
38033,c.j.,The Ayatollah's issued a statement.
38035,c.j.,"Denouncing it. Bitterly denouncing it, sir. ""Our nation can take care of its own.  Interfernce from the West is an affront to Islam."""
38036,bartlet,What's the room saying?
38037,c.j.,"They think we're hiding Leo's meeting with the Swiss. So, you know, the press coffee..."
38041,c.j.,"Sure. Thank you, Mr. President."
38042,bartlet,We're not going to not do it. I'm saying just now.
38044,bartlet,"Hi. Before you say anything, here's my idea: the kid needs lungs and a heart. Let's  use the Ayatollah's. What are you smiling at?"
38046,bartlet,"""The Iranians, they've taken to the streets."" Perfect. That goes to the Margaret Museum."
38052,bartlet,"He didn't want to try, ""My son is dying and these guys maybe can fix him? And maybe  if our citizens didn't spend quite so much energy denouncing the infidels, they'd have  time to build a damn medical school!"""
38054,bartlet,"Okay, but just tell me they weren't using cellular technology, 'cause I don't care what  anybody says, it doesn't work yet."
38062,bartlet,No. Come on! That's a fifteen-year-old non-combatant on his way to a hospital. I want  you to pretend that plane's got a big red cross on it.
38066,bartlet,"Send the communiqué, absolutely. There's a Bahrain Agreement that says... send it.  Tell them to stop. Don't even come close... I don't even want a scent of linkage to  it. A big damn red cross right on that plane."
38067,josh,I have this problem I'm trying to put in prospective.
38069,josh,Triplehorn thinks I'm a secret operative for Hoynes.
38079,josh,"They eat a lot of rice, Donna."
38080,josh,"Mrs. Rackley borrowed $1500 from Judy Vanderbass to buy a hand-carved teak bed frame  for $2000, which is a good price."
38083,josh,Making it a great price.
38085,josh,"What do you mean, ""Josh""?"
38087,josh,And I told the State Department to look after him. I didn't want him to get in any trouble.
38089,josh,See if they'll return yours.
38090,josh,Toby. Triplehorn's on fire.
38091,toby,He needs to build a case against our...
38092,josh,Hoynes is lining up precinct captains in Iowa and New Hampshire.
38093,toby,This is like ten minute after the polls close in California.
38094,josh,And Winnick just called. It's probably the same thing. Half the Senate's going to be  running. If it looks like we're giving Hoynes the keys...
38095,toby,Yeah. We got to back him off.
38096,josh,"Okay, devil's advocate. Isn't Hoynes entitled?"
38098,josh,"We got him on the ticket by convincing him it's not his turn. We kept him out of the  center ring 'cause it wasn't his turn, and now..."
38099,toby,There aren't any turns.
38102,toby,When business slows down.
38106,toby,Alternate Federal Co-Chair of the Apalachian Regional Commision.
38108,toby,It's Senate-confirmable.
38110,toby,So is Commissioner of Hopi Indian Relocation.
38112,toby,Inspector General of the Railroad Retirement Board. Director of the Institute of  Museum Studies...
38114,toby,"Ginger beat you to that joke, and Karen lost her job because of us."
38116,toby,Start getting used to the fact that we won in a landslide. We can show some fight  on this.
38118,toby,This is different. We asked her to introduce the bill.
38120,toby,"Yeah, but it's also called a recorded vote. She did that kind of thing for us. She was  our gal on the back bench."
38124,bartlet,Laney says the plane's still six hours out.
38127,bartlet,What are you talking about?
38130,bartlet,"It's in Pakistan, what does it matter?"
38132,bartlet,"Okay, but if I need a life-saving procedure, can you make sure the surgeon's suffering  from massive oxygen deprivation?"
38135,bartlet,"The one guy who can save his son and he tortured his father. That's just bad staff work.  Charlie! Are we sure about Japan? I mean, one of these days they're going to find the  fairway, right?"
38136,bartlet,Would you pull the First Lady out of whatever she's in right now?
38137,bartlet,"Well, put on a helmet and pads and get in there."
38140,josh,The National Committee's got a list of the State Party conventions where we ask the  Vice President to take our slot. Could you get that for me?
38142,josh,And the DPC sent me this list of his budget roll-outs and it's for last year. I need  all four.
38148,josh,You just called them deadbeat.
38150,josh,"Well, good one, Gracie."
38154,josh,Everything you just said in there was a good thing and just by saying it like Ethel  Mertz doesn't make it...
38156,josh,"A buck and a half, $161,200 for the leadership."
38158,josh,"Okay... I know you like to hit with me but you've got to go sit in the back of the class  'cause you just suggested that making only a $150,000 was reasonable justification for  committing a felony. Which is what it is, Lulu."
38160,josh, It's To Sir With Love.
38169,bartlet,No need to thank me. Whatever happened to Mrs. Wilburforce?
38173,bartlet,What they hell are you talking about?
38175,bartlet,Wasn't Mrs. Wilberforce our cat?
38177,bartlet,Really? All right. Eisenmenger's Syndrome.
38179,bartlet,The Ayatollah's son has it.
38181,bartlet,"No, but I'm concerned about spousal abuse."
38183,bartlet,The only doctor available won't do it.
38189,bartlet,I can't order him to do it.
38191,bartlet,Through the power vested in me by you?
38193,bartlet,"Just for the record, this is why we don't talk about foreign policy. Which we do, and  you don't think we do it enough."
38195,bartlet,Because Samuel Mudd was tried and convicted of treason for setting that leg.
38199,bartlet,The patient right in front of them?
38201,bartlet,All right. Go back to the sewing thing.
38203,josh,"Yeah, I don't get Hawaii. Great weather, great beaches, universal health care... I'm  waiting for the other shoe to drop."
38205,josh,Because if he went home without a tan...
38206,josh,We got to talk politics.
38207,josh,We need you to stop shopping for precinct captains.
38208,josh,"We're days after an election, we've got to govern. It's too early..."
38209,josh,Triplehorn alone can tie us in knots.
38210,josh,"You've got a Constitutional obligation, that comes first."
38211,josh,"We need these two years. It's our last chance to govern, John..."
38212,josh,There are going to be lots of ways...
38213,josh,What's that supposed to mean?
38214,josh,Half this town's going to be runnung. I do the President's politics. He can't govern  if I'm seen as...
38216,bartlet,"""The boy's on the plane. He's experiencing pulmonary hypertension."" That's elevated  pressure in the lungs, I think. That could lead to what? Doctor, that could lead to what?"
38217,bartlet,That cold lead to what?
38218,bartlet,That's what it says here. Follow me.
38219,bartlet,"That's right, and he has something called in situ thrombi."
38220,bartlet,"Dr. Mohebi, I don't care. Why aren't you scrubbing up?"
38223,bartlet,I know this. Don't you think I know?
38224,bartlet,I'll let you know who the enemy is. That's my job. It's not a 15-year-old boy.
38225,bartlet,Doctors Without Borders.
38226,bartlet,I do know these people. You're crazy if you don't think I do.
38228,bartlet,Nothing will happen to them.
38229,bartlet,Nothing will happen to them.
38230,bartlet,"Well, the Swiss, I guess. Look, I'll use every power of the office to protect you and  your family, of course I will. Can I just say that this is how things change for the  better? A world-class surgeon or a schoolteacher in Afjah who questions the ayatollah's  divine power. Do me a favor, Doctor, go back to Smith-Lansing and look at the kid,  'cause I think when you do, you're going to scrub up. If you don't, I respect that,  and the man made his own bed. Okay?"
38231,bartlet,What was your father's name?
38233,bartlet,Thank you. Get him to Baltimore.
38235,josh,"Not whitewater rafting. And staff can't make those calls. They're top-tier Iowa people,  and New Hampshire. Forty, fifty calls from the Flathead River?"
38237,josh,That's what I'm saying.
38239,josh,What do I tell Triplehorn?
38242,toby,You can't have the job.
38243,toby,The parks bill... we made it Senate-confirmable.
38244,toby,They added it in conference. We'll find something. I don't know what.
38245,toby,Can't be Museum Studies. God forbid the Senate falls out of the mix on that.
38246,toby,"We asked you to fight a losing... Yes, we owe you."
38247,toby,I called the play. I called it.
38248,toby,It was a loser and I pushed to have you introduce it anyway.
38249,toby,"Well, look, let's just..."
38250,toby,"And, clearly, that argument took the nation by storm."
38251,toby,"Yeah, but I'm the Romans."
38259,bartlet,Is there another Democrat?
38263,bartlet,And I know how you feel. You like Scott Holcomb?
38267,bartlet,You're going to campaign on prescription drugs?
38271,bartlet,It's okay to run away from me when you need to.
38273,bartlet,I appreciate that but that's not what I'm talking about. You disagreed with me on  Medicare. I remember the meeting right here. Then you wrote a five-page memo. Run  towards yourself. I'm wrong about that. Walk. You're not going to be used to your  surroundings.
38275,bartlet,"You lose, you lose, but if you waste this, I'll kill you. I'll just kill you, Sam."
38282,bartlet,Yeah. I'm going to bed.
38288,bartlet,I said thanks on the behalf of the ticket. I can't help it if...
38290,bartlet,They'll thank whatever they want.
38292,bartlet,I'm freezing it for us. We just won four more years. It's not time for a free-for-all.
38294,bartlet,Do I call them all back?
38300,bartlet,All right. Anything else?
38302,bartlet,"Well, Mohebi's day just started."
38307,c.j.,You're going to hear a story.
38308,bartlet,Uh-huh. I am a character in this story?
38309,c.j.,"Well, I suppose that's up to you. A navy pilot, lieutenant commander Vickie Hilton  has been taken under arrest by the military police as being charged by the judge  advocate with having an affair with a married officer, an inferior, a lieutenant-jg."
38310,bartlet,I don't see being a character.
38316,bartlet,Could have gone better. I didn't think adultery was against the uniform code.
38318,bartlet,Yeah. It's against military law?
38324,bartlet,For failure to follow an order?
38326,bartlet,We shold have that here.
38327,bartlet,"Good morning, Mr. Secretary, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the final Cabinet  meeting of Bartlet one. I don't know if this is true, but a Presidential historian  told me that this was the most stable cabinet since Hoover's. Which is nice, but you  got to think, how many other jobs were really available? But here are facts. You  created over nine million new jobs, and the highest home-ownership rate on record.  More than 150 new trade agreements. You created the largest expansion of college aid  since the GI Bill. Cleaned up over 500 toxic waste dumps. And you did it all while  eliminating 16,000 pages of federal regulations. Not bad for government work. Thank you."
38329,c.j.,We are. I think all the Bahrain signatories are and we're expressing our concern  through the appropriate multilateral channels. John.
38330,c.j.,"I can tell you that he's been working out some new material and that it has absolutely  been destroying on the campuses. Of course, Showtime will have their cameras at APEC  to record the whole thing for the President's one-hour special called Bartlet: In the  Thick of It. "
38331,c.j.,"No. I'll finish with a little housekeeping for those who don't know. In a two-term  Presidency, as a matter of courtesy, the President's cabinet resigns without being  asked, giving the President the option of hiring them or not, rather than firing  them or not. Those resignations will be submitted today. That's all. Thanks."
38335,c.j.,"Sorry, I forgot. I moved the news magazines to the fourth row."
38336,c.j.,"It isn't a thing, Mitch. There are cameras in here now that are framing part of the  gallery and not just the podium and the news magazines aren't here everyday so the  camera's getting a couple of empty seats."
38337,c.j.,"Yeah, but we're safe after row three, so I put you guys in four."
38338,c.j.,"Well, I certainly didn't mean it as one."
38339,c.j.,"Mitch, I put you in the very first row I don't care about. Of the things I don't  care about, I put you right up front. I'll see you later."
38340,toby,You should amend that in a statement to say that the resignations are effective  whenever they are effective.
38343,c.j.,He's going to remember he doesn't say a word about labor without running it past of  the local AFL?
38347,c.j.,And he's got to go door-to-door. He hasn't lived there since he was 18.
38349,c.j.,"Speaking of which, high school snapshots."
38351,toby,You're taking the Lakers banner?
38353,toby,"'Cause there's a shortage of them in Southern California? Leave it, and leave  the stapler."
38355,toby,And they might need a stapler. It's ours.
38357,toby,You've logged a lot of miles in the last couple of weeks.
38363,toby,Michael's who you use when you need brief remarks to whoever wrote the check we  couldn't turn down.
38365,toby,Jerry's who you use when you can't get Michael. there's no one on the speech writing  staff who could do this. It's okay.
38367,toby,You're going to remember the local AFL?
38369,toby,You got to go door-to-door.
38371,toby,You were 18 when you lived there.
38373,toby,Put the banner back. See you next week.
38374,josh,There are some new people.
38378,josh,I'm not one to give fashion advice...
38382,josh,"...one of them is wearing a... a, uh... a Star Trek pin. Is today a special Star Trek  holiday or something?"
38384,josh,"Okay, well, then would you find out? And is it's not, you know people walk through  here and it's not the most confidence-inspiring sight to see in a White House employee,  so if you could ask her to..."
38386,josh,Yeah. Can I have my briefing memo? 
38389,josh,"You're... almost there, but you're not quite getting it. When it's something you're  paid to do, that's not a favor. What do you got?"
38391,josh,"Wow, I'm definately not going to do that."
38393,josh,"Aren't those basically women who've come up to you and said ""Is that Josh Lyman?"""
38397,josh,"Well, I'll properly I.D. you for him, no problem."
38399,josh,"I can't, Potsie. Ralph and I are double-dating the Dubrusky twins."
38405,josh," Hey, what are you doing here?"
38408,josh, What's the meeting about?
38411,josh, I know what the meeting's about.
38412,josh,There's no way the White House is going to get involved in it. It's a military thing.
38413,josh,And the Commander-in-Chief chooses not to overrule his commanders.
38414,josh,"Yes, 'cause then when he says no, I got a problem with women."
38415,josh,"What happened to ""I came wielding nothing""?"
38416,josh," ""Evidently, you did, too."""
38417,josh,"All right, we'll talk in 15 minutes."
38456,c.j.,"No, I definately wouldn't. The President's fully commited to Kyoto and thinks it's  time we began adopting to the impact of greenhouse gases is all. Mark?"
38457,c.j.,I'm just going to stop you right there direct you to the Pentagon. Mitch.
38458,c.j.,"Well, we already discussed that but if you want to talk to me more in my office..."
38459,c.j.,"Well, it's my house, Mitch. But, as a matter of fact, I consulted with the White House  Correspondent's Association."
38460,c.j.,Or you attitude. But that's not why I changed the seating. Thank you.
38461,josh," Okay, I'm going to see Fitzwallace."
38463,josh,"Hey, I see she's not wearing the pin anymore. Thanks."
38469,josh,"Yeah, the reason why I wanted you to take off the pin is just around the White House,  you understand..."
38471,josh,"Right, except Stacy works for me."
38476,josh,"She is... well, one of the special people."
38478,josh,She's taken off the pin. We're going to let it be.
38480,josh,That's right. What do you think about this Vickie Hilton problem?
38482,josh,"No, I mean about whether it's right for the White House to be involved."
38484,josh,You've got to go faster next time. I'm here already.
38486,josh,"Mr. Chairman, thank you. Hope you haven't been waiting."
38487,josh,"Yeah, there's going to be pressure from women for the President to intercede, and  I was hoping we could find a way to intercede without involving the President."
38488,josh,"I understand. I guess also, the thing is she isn't just any pilot. She's like Jackie  Robinson. She's busted a lot of barriers. She's the first woman at Miramar, first  woman to fly the F-14 Tomcat, she teaches on an F-14. I guess at this point I don't  have to give you her résumé."
38489,josh,"Just out of curiosity, if you could step in, would you save her?"
38490,josh,I have to tell you it just doesn't seem right to me.
38491,josh,"Admiral, you know I have all the respect in the world for you, right?"
38492,josh,"And if I didn't, I'd respect the unifrom, the rank and the position anyway?"
38493,josh,I feel like I have to go to Leo.
38496,toby,"Oh, we have an appointment, right?"
38502,toby,"So, you want a job on the speechwriting staff?"
38504,toby,You want a job on the speechwriting staff.
38510,toby,Sam told me you wanted to see me about a job on the speech writing staff.
38514,toby,Sam's doing a little matchmaking. I'm fine doing this by myself.
38518,toby," Yeah, it's not personal a speech like this. Obviously it takes a certain  amount of experience and, uh..."
38519,toby,"...and uh, a certain something."
38521,toby,'Cause you don't have the experience.
38525,toby,I read the Stanford Club speech. I thought it was good. Not as good as other people  thought it was.
38527,toby,"Call and response isn't going to work in front of a Joint Session. You're alliteration  happy: ""guardians of gridlock,"" ""protectors of privilege."" I needed an avalanche of  Advil. And when you use pop-culture references, your speech has a shelf life of twelve  minutes. You don't mind constructive criticism, do you? "
38529,toby,"Anyway, thanks for coming in. I told Sam I can do this by myself."
38531,toby,"A 500-word stanza on American leadership in a globally interdependent age that moves  beyond triumphalism by this time tomorrow. If it's 501, don't show it to me."
38544,toby,Is that something you usually read?
38546,toby,Why were you reading it?
38548,toby,We're a little shorthanded over there. I did it myself.
38556,toby,"The adjustment period with me, for a new person..."
38558,toby,"Maybe, and if I did, it was like, a week ago. "
38560,toby,Who? Who would you get?
38562,toby,"There are not people who... You're like the guys who say, ""Are you telling me you  could only find one African-American speechwriter good enough to work at the White  House?"" I'm amazed I found that many. ""Good enough to work at the White House"" is a  pretty small population to begin with. And guys who can write entire sections of a  State of the Union? I'd be as surprised if there were as many as nine of us. Sam was  one of them."
38564,toby,I think we invested time and money teaching her how to fly a warplane which turns out  she does very well and there aren't that many who do. So I'm going to go ahead and  pick national security over caring who she sleeps with.
38566,toby,It can't go in the Oval Office.
38570,toby,Is Jordan pestering you? 'Cause I'm getting it from Andy on this day and night.
38574,toby,This is what I'm saying.
38578,bartlet,"Okay, thank you.  What the hell is going on with the seats in the briefing room?"
38579,c.j.,"I wouldn't worry about it, Mr. President."
38580,bartlet,"I'm not worried about it, but I just read about it."
38581,c.j.,"The news magazines aren't here every day and the empty seats don't look good on camera,  so I moved them to the fourth row. I think you shouldn't comment on it."
38582,bartlet,I'll comment on it. I'll say sit your ass where you're told and get back to work.
38583,c.j.,"Yeah, and I don't think you should do that."
38587,bartlet,Okay.  We'll have to return.
38588,bartlet," Anyway, you're going to take care of it?"
38589,c.j.,I'm going to have a camera positioned moved.
38590,bartlet,"Well, I'm sorry to hear you caving, but whatever."
38591,c.j.,"Yeah, I'm not caving, sir."
38592,bartlet,"Well, okay, but still, whatever."
38594,bartlet,Thanks.  This is Jack Reese. He's working for Nancy. This is Josh  Lyman and C.J. Cregg.
38597,bartlet,They're talking about a force level data-fusion network.
38598,bartlet,Nancy thinks France will come around after the North Sea exercise.
38600,bartlet,Okay. Thanks very much everybody.
38603,josh,"Hi, I'm Josh Lyman. We just met in there."
38604,josh,"This conversation you and I are having right now, it was not my idea to have it.  This must be distinctly understood."
38605,josh,You've meet my assistant Donna.
38606,josh,"Well, if you like that, she nearly got arrested once when she got her arm stuck in a  mailbox trying to retrieve a letter she wrote to Ilie Nastase. She once left her  underpants at an art opening and, after a summit in Belarus, she tried to smuggle  11 scented Minsk candles into an overnnight bag. They evecuated the terminal."
38617,josh,I think I did well. I think I fanned the flame.
38621,josh,He said he thought it was cool that you were looking for someone to trade votes.
38623,josh,I told him there are plenty more where that came from.
38625,josh,I told him about Ilie Nastase.
38629,josh,I thought it went with the vote swapping theme.
38631,josh,The scented Minsk candles.
38633,josh,These are endearing stories.
38635,josh,"When you were trying to get the job, you were pretending that you'd already gotten  the job, so it's not like your underwear at an art gallery was going to change my mind."
38639,josh,I think the underwear on the floor speaks for itself.
38643,josh,"Maybe, but he's not going to care."
38645,josh,Guys will go out with anybody.
38649,josh,"Okay, but I'm going to work for a while on making people's lives better."
38652,bartlet,You're going to talk to Berryhill?
38654,bartlet,He wants to feel loved.
38656,bartlet,You'll make him feel loved? I want him in the Cabinet.
38660,bartlet,You think we should get involved?
38666,bartlet,"'Cause I got to tell you, I've been hearing it from Abbey and the girls."
38670,bartlet,"No, I meant about Vickie Hilton."
38672,bartlet,"Sure. Yes, but isn't there some question as to whether it's practical to give that order  in the first place?"
38674,bartlet,"No, I'm just saying there are few side to this."
38676,bartlet,But we'll hear no others because we don't want it in the Oval Office.
38681,c.j.,I hope you weren't waiting.
38682,c.j.,"Well, you win, I lose. I don't want this to be a story. I want the President to be  able to function. I'm moving the news magazines back up front and I apologize."
38683,c.j.,"When you're not here, there'll be a sign on your chair with you name and the name of  your publication. I've given C-SPAN permission for a second camera position that's on  your seat so the braodcast director can go there at his or her discretion."
38684,c.j.,"No. If you're not here, you better get a seat filler and they better be prepared  'cause they are going to be called on for the honor of the first question. This  should be about other people, don't you think?"
38685,c.j.,"I know. Happy Thanksgiving, Mitch."
38686,c.j.,"By the way, Danny Concannon won a Pulitzer prize from the fourth row."
38688,josh,I'm really sorry to bother you.
38689,josh,What are you working on?
38692,josh,Really?  No. There's no symphony or... people.
38693,josh,"Listen, it occurs to me that, uh... you know, I mentioned Donna before and it occurs  to me that I told you that I named some things that tickled me. I... I don't know.  I certainly wouldn't want to leave you with the impression that she was... you know...  Anyway, if you wanted to ask her out, she'd probably say yes."
38696,josh,Sure. Tell me your aide's name. I'll ask her out. We'll double.
38697,josh,I got the fuzzy end of that lolipop.
38698,josh,"So, that's it. We're done talking about Donna. Whose full name is Donnatella, by  the way. Mom's Italian... Dad's Irish. Okay. Thanks."
38699,bartlet,He's wrong. Leo's wrong. Are we to live with the assumption that there are no men  in the services who've commited adultery? I don't know what's worse: being stupid  or pretending to be stupid. Tell him that.
38700,bartlet,"No, I'm going to do it."
38701,bartlet,"Eisenhower and Kay Summersby, a subordinate. Hammond with the wives of two junior  officers. So, G.I. Jane gets a court-martial? G.I. Joe gets a short film on hygeine?  That is all I have to say to you. "
38702,bartlet,I forgot to tell him something else.
38704,bartlet,That's right. Because men don't give that order to other men.
38706,bartlet,"The daughter of the president of Brazil, which presented a politcal prblem for me.  Also, I didn't fire him, I asked him to resign. And I set him up in the private sector.  And if you think the differnce is semantics, look up dishonorable discharge in there.  Look up Fort Leavenworth."
38708,bartlet,I read the memo on Rwanda. Average rainfall nine inches. That's the memo Toby wanted  me to read?
38713,bartlet," There are big signs! You can't park there! They should get towed! I hope  they get towed to Queens and the Triboro is closed and there's a big craft show at Shea,  a flea market or a tractor show! "
38715,bartlet,Do you really think that Vicky Hilton is unable to distinguish between this order  and a combat order?
38719,bartlet,"Well, you didn't let me finish."
38721,bartlet,"I may also be right. We get five more people in here, I think we're going to have  eight opinions."
38725,bartlet,"And two elections in a row, people said they wanted me to run that."
38727,bartlet,"Right now, I'm not talking about overruling anyone or pardoning anyone. Right now,  I'm just talking about having people over and asking questions. I like basketball,  but I can't play. I don't know why. I played in prep school and I liked being on  the team, but I didn't want the ball and the coach said, ""Jed, winners always want  the ball."" I said, ""Coach, winners are also better then I am."" He said, ""Son, to  be a winner, you've got to think like a winner."" I said, ""Coach, to be a winner,  you've also got to be better than I am."" Anyway, he was right. Winners want the ball.  I don't think I ever want to hear it's too sticky for the Oval Office.  What are you smiling at?"
38729,bartlet,"Are we together on this? Do we have resolve? We've got four years, no election and a  Republican Congress that hates me and actually hates you more. You ready to saddle up?"
38731,bartlet,All right. Good then. Happy Thanksgiving.
38732,josh,Hey. I think he's going to call you.
38738,josh,"Have a good time. Those are good stories about you, though. Those stories would make  me like you."
38740,josh,Tomorrow's Thanksgiving.
38742,josh,"I meant, you won't be coming in early tomorrow. You won't be coming in at all."
38748,josh,What's your name again?
38749,josh,"I'm a fan. I'm a sports fan, I'm a music fan and I'm a Star Trek fan. All of them.  But here's what I don't do. Tell me if any of this sounds familiar: ""Let's list our  ten favorite episodes. Let's list our least favorite episodes. Let's list our favorite  galaxies. Let's make a chart to see how often our favorite galaxies appear in our  favorite episodes. What Romulan would you most like to see coupled with a Cardassian  and why? Let's spend a weekend talking about Romulans falling in love with Cardassians  and then let's do it again."" That's not being a fan. That's having a fetish. And I don't  have a problem with that, except you can't bring your hobbies in to work, okay?"
38750,josh,Except on Star Trek holidays. 
38751,josh,"Well, work hard around here. We'll make one."
38752,toby,"...not just a chance, but a mission unique in all of human... To prove that liberty is...  To prove that... Freedom unlocks... a higher fraction of the human potential... than...  than any..."
38757,toby,"Stop reading it, please. "
38758,toby,We can't offer you any money. We could put you in a hotel.
38760,toby,"Fine, but she's on your payroll. "
38761,toby,"This is incredibly good, Will. ""Never shrinking from the world's..."" ""...a fierce  belief in what we can achieve together."" I used to write like this. It was ten months  ago. I don't understand what's going on. I really don't. I've had slumps before.  Everybody does, but this is different. I'm sorry, we don't know each other, but there  aren't that many people I can talk to about it. I don't understand what's happening.  There's no blood going to it. I never had to locate it before. I don't even know where  to look. I'm the President's voice and I don't want it to sound like this. And there's  an incredible history to second inaugurals. ""Fear itself,"" Lincoln... I really thought  I was on my way to being one of those guys. I thought I was close. Now I'm just writing  for my life and you can't serve the President that way. But if I didn't write... I can't  serve him at all."
38763,toby,What's the third thing?
38765,toby,"All right. All right. Chances are you have certain qualities that are gonna annoy me.  I don't know what they are yet, but you have a certain quality about you that says that  even though you're a capitalist, you've been schooled in Eastern philosophies."
38767,toby,You didn't deny you've been schooled in Eastern philosophy.
38771,toby,"Good, 'cause they're never annoying."
38773,toby,"Well, I appreciate that."
38775,toby,You didn't give it to me yesterday?
38780,c.j.,It's really starting to get socked in out there and I'm worried about the airports.
38781,c.j.,"Well, one more after this."
38782,c.j.,You just want them to take you to their place and... 
38783,c.j.,Yes. Sing... is what I was going to say. Take you to their place and sing.
38784,c.j.,You should hear these guys...
38786,josh,No. She's meeting Jack Reese at the Washington Inn. How does he get a room at the Wash--  I can't get a room at the Washington Inn.  Me? I don't know yet. What do you need?
38790,josh,"'Cause Mary and Joseph couldn't get a room at the inn and they went to this place,  which is now on Christmas-- the irony isn't self- explanatory?"
38799,toby,Tobias Zachary Ziegler.
38803,toby,You would have to ask her.
38807,toby,But you have to demonstrate relevancy.
38808,toby,The conspiracy was massive.
38809,toby,"As I understand pregnancy, it's a binary state, you either are or you aren't."
38810,toby,"Once again, there are medical records."
38812,toby,"I'm told that on my sunniest of days, I'm not that fun to be around. I wonder what's  going to happen when you make my children a part of your life."
38813,c.j.,The President and First Lady will board Air Force One this evening at 7:30 for their  flight to Manchester and attend midnight mass tomorrow at the Church of the Sacred Heart.  Mark... what are you doing?
38814,c.j.,You were supposed to come in here as Santa Claus.
38817,c.j.,"Well, this is exactly what happened to Ebenezer Scrooge who was a very nice little guy  until something happened with Mr. Fezziwig that I can't remember. "
38818,c.j.,"All right, back to business."
38820,c.j.,"Santa, you'll be mindful of security, right?"
38821,c.j.,"I've been bad, I've been very bad."
38822,c.j.,Aww... It's a goldfish pin! Thank you everyone. It's beautiful. Merry Christmas.  This is so sweet. Thank you. That's a full lid.
38823,c.j.,"They gave me a gold fish pin 'cause I like goldfish. Actually, what I like are the  crackers, but there was a guy... "
38826,toby,Why do you sit in the lobby instead of my office?
38828,toby,I wasn't listening to anything you just said.
38830,toby,It's 'cause I didn't care.
38832,toby,This has become inconvenient for me.
38834,toby,Your being at OEOB and me having meetings in the lobby. I'm moving you closer.
38836,toby,The empty office next to me.
38840,toby,You'll move your stuff in today.
38846,toby,Don't be ridiculous. It's a West Wing office. Everyone who works in the White House is  gonna resent you.
38848,toby,"Yet, curiously, I don't care."
38850,toby,"Get your stuff, and we'll talk about the notes."
38852,toby,"Zach, can you call Joan Tanner at the EPA, please?"
38854,toby,Josh got you in? You talked to Josh?
38855,toby,"Ginger, tell security to stand by at Station Six, please."
38856,bartlet,There's a new international math and science study. We rank 19 out of 21 countries.
38857,bartlet,This is what I'm talking about.
38858,bartlet,South Africa and Cyprus.
38859,bartlet,"No, you don't. Nor us anymore, for that matter. One-third of all math teachers and half  of science teachers didn't major or minor in that subject."
38860,bartlet,"And we'll want to get to the bottom of that. But we're increasing education spending to  over a $100 billion a year and, as a result, we have seventh grade textbooks being used  in ninth grade and the same answers get a higher score on S.A.T.s."
38861,bartlet,Right. But I'm talking about children now.
38863,bartlet,You don't want to know.
38864,bartlet,"I got 800/790. For the life of me, I can't imagine what I got wrong. Then I took them  again, and got 800/790. I mean, is it possible there was some sort of number-two pencil  anomaly that could've...?"
38865,bartlet,"Yeah, I know, it's a little... something."
38866,bartlet,"So our schools have reached a crisis and our infant mortality rate is two and a half  times what it is in Singapore. So what I think we should do for starters is, we should  keep more people alive, then send them to school. Get a little peace and prosperity going."
38867,bartlet,"Stanley, the width and depth of what I haven't done about it yet... You know you can't  do anything about hurricanes? The President can't do anything about nature or bad luck.  I ought to be able to do something about the airplane."
38868,bartlet,"Wait, what'd I just say?"
38869,bartlet,What do airplanes signify?
38871,bartlet,"Stanley, I never thought to ask, but you are a doctor, right?"
38873,bartlet,I've been spacing out for a minute at meetings. Three times this week. I hear someone  talking and realize I wasn't listening to part of it.
38882,bartlet,"And now we're one-third of the way through an Agatha Chrstie story.  ""Where  nobody be goin' nowhere. The bridge is washed out."" Well, I'm finished. But I was doing  the guy that says that in the Agatha Christie stories. Stanley, as always. Leo, I'll be  in the office."
38884,c.j.,The score gets that high?
38885,c.j.,When did you start liking cricket?
38886,c.j.,"Oh, I love Bermuda. I like the scooters."
38888,c.j.,This is like something you'd get on the Internet.
38889,josh,The Israelis say it's unsafe.
38891,josh,"They're worried about the roof caving in, part of it collasped this morning."
38893,josh,'Cause they'd have to bring in hammers and nails.
38895,josh,"Of course that's what they're worried about. Leo, there are like 93,000 other churches  within rock-throwing distance of this place. I'm not sure..."
38898,toby,What the hell are you doing? What were you doing?
38899,josh,"Yes, I'm sorry. Yes, I did."
38900,toby,I wish you hadn't and you knew that.
38903,toby,Your flight's canceled. All the shuttles are canceled for a while.
38904,toby,"No, you can't. The tracks are frozen in Trenton. What hotel are you staying at?  We'll see if we can get you the room for a few hours more."
38906,toby, Would you call around to the hotels we know and see if anybody's got  a room for me?
38910,toby,Looks like some of the junior staffers may have moved their bicycles in here in protest.
38914,toby,I agree with all three of them.
38916,toby,"Except, if you say, at the beginning of the administration that you want campaign reform,  and nothing happens, then you just spent four years doing nothing about campaign reform."
38918,toby,I-I still think he's right but it gets a conversation. Someone will tell you what time  the meeting is.
38924,toby,"You can tell 'em I said move the bicycles, you know?"
38927,toby,We're striking out on hotels.
38928,toby,"Okay, that's a good idea. You've been convicted of multiple felonies. You think the  U.S. Secret Service lets you walk around this building unescourted?! You can't!  You're a threat to the President!"
38929,toby,I'm going to work for a while now.
38939,bartlet,I want to see Josh in his office. Let him know I'm coming.
38941,josh,"No, no, actually three units are in the Sudan and a fourth is in Turkey, which...  just had a 6.2 seismic experience. That's an earthquake, right? Okay, just make  sure they know it's just transportation and oversight. We don't need materials. "
38942,josh,"Come in. Becky, also... "
38943,josh,"Excuse me. I'll call you back. Good afternoon, Mr. President."
38944,bartlet,"Listen, this is going to sound crazy but Olympia Buckland had an infant mortality  bill that we asked her not to take out of committee 'cause it was too expensive."
38946,bartlet,I'd like her initiative or something similiar to be folded into the HHS budget.
38947,josh,"Yes, sir. We can make it a priority with the next Congress."
38948,bartlet,"No, I mean I want it for the next Congress. You understand what I'm saying?"
38949,josh,"I... Yes, I think that you're saying that before it goes to the printer on January 1st,  you want to rewrite the federal budget."
38950,bartlet,"A little bit, yeah. If we nip and tuck in different departments we can do it. It'll  take an around-the-clock kind of effort. Yes it's a holiday, but OMB works for us, right?"
38952,bartlet,You think this is crazy?
38953,josh,"No, certainly not crazier than Leo going for peace in the Middle East by the close  of business."
38956,josh,"Thank you, Mr. President."
38957,josh,I'm sorry. It's not what it looks like.
38961,josh,"HHS budget, it seems very important to him and there's hard deadline."
38963,josh,I'll have you on the road as soon as I possibly can.
38965,josh,Call the policy council. Tell them we need to package an initiative on infant  mortality. I'll walk them through it.
38977,bartlet,"Okay. Well, I sent some notes on the Congressional section."
38979,bartlet,Isn't that why you're here?
38983,bartlet,I thought it was about the notes on the Congressional section.
38985,bartlet,Okay. Would you like to come back with Toby?
38987,bartlet,"Well, thanks for stopping by."
38993,toby,"On the Hill. You're not at the Hill. So, I'm back. How'd it go?"
38997,toby,Makes you feel like you'll never know the love of a real woman.
38999,toby,Sure. What'd he say on the Congressional section? Never quite got there.
39001,toby,Yeah. That's a harsh look in the mirror. That'll be with you the next time you try  to make love to a real woman.
39003,toby,"Bonnie, would you get Mr. Bailey and myself a few minutes with the President this  evening?"
39004,toby,"And, people, there are laws against campaigning in Federal buildings. If you're going  to cover Will's office, please use plain oak tag or shaving cream, if you need to. Okay?"
39006,toby,"No, but hang on a second."
39007,toby,When was Albert Anastasia killed?
39008,toby,When was Anastasia killed?
39015,toby,"Listen, when you get home tonight you're going to be confronted by the instinct to  drink alone. Trust that instinct. Manage the pain. Don't try to be a hero."
39017,toby,These are all good questions.
39023,toby,"He made ladies' raincoats and before that, he worked for Murder Incorporated."
39024,toby,"Boy, it really is snowing."
39025,josh,"There problem is, there's been an earthquake in Turkey and those units are occupied.  I say there's been an earthquake. A 6.2 seismic experience. Thank you, I realize the  hour and it's a holiday but if can get back to me. Thank you. "
39027,josh,What are they talking about?
39029,josh,They want to cut early childhood nutrition? The kids will just die later.
39033,josh,A tax on poor people 'cause they can't afford medical care.
39035,josh,I'll get you there first thing in the morning.
39037,josh,Jack's already down there?
39039,josh,I'll call him and apologize.
39041,josh,I meant that I wasn't keeping you here on purpose.
39045,josh,"I don't know. It was just something I said. Listen, it doesn't have to be a disaster,  you know. C.J.'s staff is going to make little snowmen and stick them on the seats in  the Press Briefing Room and take a picture. We can do that and then I'll get you drunk  at the Hawk and Dove."
39047,josh,I have to go see the President.
39049,josh,Leo and the President have gone Chrsimas crazier than usual.
39051,josh,"Yeah, I got an e-mail from him. Any sparks?"
39052,c.j.,Come here for a second.
39053,c.j.,"He's chasing a story that says the day Shareef's plane went down, there was an airstrip  in Bermuda that was secured by Rangers."
39055,c.j.,I told him. I didn't ask him any questions.
39056,josh,"Danny thinks w-we somehow got a Gulfstream to land in Bermuda, assassinated Sharef,  then disassembled the plane and distributed the pieces throughout the Bermuda Triangle?"
39058,josh,I think he spent too much time in the Africa hot.
39061,c.j.,I'm absolutely certain that's what happened.
39062,josh,We're not supposed to talk about his.
39063,c.j.,"If it is true, we need to say so before Danny does. We've been here before."
39064,josh,"Not here, but I get your point."
39066,bartlet,He's the best-looking person I've ever seen in real life.
39068,bartlet,"Yeah, that was a setback for the Bourbons. Listen..."
39069,bartlet,"Zoey, I think it's really sweet that you still come to me for permission. You're classy,  and you're old-fashioned."
39070,bartlet,Not in a million years.
39071,bartlet,Listen. Sit down for a second.
39072,bartlet,"When you were little, like two, I really wanted you to like me and I wan't sure you did.  With Liz and Ellie, my act just worked and with you I had to try harder. "
39073,bartlet,I did something a few months ago and I'm sure I was right and I'd do it again but it's  hard to live with. This is ridiculous. You're freezing. Come inside.
39076,bartlet,"You know, why don't you go back to the Residence and make sure your mom hasn't killed  your boyfriend. Yeah, he can come to Manchester. He's going to have more Secret Service  stuff to do, and he's going to have to sleep in the root cellar which, like your bedroom  door, will be guarded round the clock by two U.S. Marshals."
39078,bartlet,I almost told her. I've been feeling it a little lately. I've been exorcising my guilt  by having Josh crowbar infant mortality money into the HHS budget on December 23 at 8:00.
39084,bartlet,Yeah. We'll figure it out.
39086,bartlet,"Stanley thought it was weird that I took the SAT's again, too."
39088,bartlet,You don't think it's possible that the remaining answer was important?
39092,bartlet,How the hell would you know? You got 1400.
39095,toby,"Good evening, Mr. President."
39096,bartlet,"Yeah. Listen, my reasons for not wanting to talk about campaign reform at the  Inauguration are simple. It's not a legislative speech and when we cite issues,  it should be the ones that affect people's lives. You agree?"
39099,toby,"No, sir. In his defense, he caught the bad note. He came to me. He made it important."
39101,toby,He wasn't distracted bt the fact that his office was filled with bicycles.
39105,toby,"Yeah, that was planted there to see how well you'd do telling truth to power."
39108,bartlet,"Okay, except when I asked you to come into the Oval Office you said, ""No, no, no.  No, no, no, no."""
39110,bartlet,And you called me Mr. Justice.
39116,toby,"Thank you, Mr. President."
39117,josh,I just need to tell you this. Come here. 
39121,josh,"All right, it was desperation. It wasn't out of a desire to do evil. He had a young  family and he barely spoke the language. He went to jail. He went to jail and you went  to school, and it was all a half century ago. Look what he did in two generations.  What room did you just walk out of?"
39122,toby,I appreciate that that's what you think. Do I get to think what I think?
39123,josh,"No, you don't, 'cause you don't know what I know."
39125,josh,"That I would give anything to have a father who was a felon, or a sister with a past.  That's it."
39127,josh,I don't mind. People are working on it. I have Donna here with me. We've got a whole  night planned around it.
39132,toby,"Oh, my God. I know when Anastasia was killed. I know about that candy store in  Brownsville. I know about Louie Amberg. I know about the Half Moon Hotel sixth story  window, Coney Island!"
39134,toby,We don't have to do this all in one night.
39135,toby,It's getting late. Stay on my couch. You're getting out in the morning.
39136,toby,You should stay tonight with me.
39139,toby,The Whiffenpoofs. It's a group called the Wiffenpoofs. They're from Yale. They came  to do a series of concerts and the snow...
39140,toby,Whiffenpoofs. I'm surprised you haven't heard of them. You used to like Cole Porter  a lot.
39146,josh,"It's fine. Of course it's fine. It's great. I was feeling guilty, but now, this...  is good. This, this... is better than good. It's the way it should be."
39150,josh,You'll tell me when you need to.
39152,josh,By fixing a roof. I'm staying on the phones. You want to stay with me?
39154,josh,"Three years I've worked in the Senate, four years in the White House, this is my  first time in the Republican cloakroom."
39155,josh,You guys use the same decorator as we do.
39156,josh,"Hey, was Benjamin Harrison banned from here?"
39157,josh,Prompting another resolution?
39158,josh,Is there any chance that Nearing is soft? Is there anything that makes her vote yea?
39160,josh,What about Herman Morton?
39161,josh,"It's 50-50, Jane. Hoynes has a sleeping bag in there. We need to, you and I..."
39164,josh,"Wait, wait, wait a second..."
39166,josh,What the hell do I care? These people are responding to...
39167,josh,Now you're for more education funding?
39168,josh,Of course foreign aid polls badly. The people it's helping aren't the ones answering  the phone.
39169,josh,The Senator just reached this conclusion when the Libery Foundation--
39170,josh,"When you say the New York Times people, you're not talking about the people the who  work there, are you?"
39171,josh,"You mean ""people who can read?"""
39172,josh,I understand what it is.
39173,josh,I think this is crap. I think your boss has known about this poll for awhile and he's  embarassing the President at the eleventh hour because he spent too much time with his  arm around the other guy.
39174,josh,On the first vote out of the box.
39176,bartlet,It's the curse of every daughter's father.
39177,bartlet,I don't like them. I don't like them at all.
39178,bartlet,What the hell happened with you two? It was perfect. I just kept you in the office  all the time.
39179,bartlet,"That was the point. If I was trying to make her happy, I'd buy her a Cabriolet."
39181,bartlet,C-Jean. Stable economies with free-flowing uranium don't make for a stable world  community. Did I make that point?
39183,bartlet,Good. And is there a cow on my schedule today?
39184,c.j.,It's called Heifer International. Don't worry about it.
39185,bartlet, I'm meeting with a cow. I shouldn't worry about it.
39186,c.j.,"It's a photo-op with a cow, sir. It's not a sit-down."
39188,c.j.,"You got a very nice sass, yourself... sir."
39192,bartlet,How you doing? Good to see you. Great. Thank you. Thanks for coming. Thank you.  Thank you. Thank you very much. 
39193,bartlet,Thank you. Thank you. Good to see you. How are you? How are you?
39200,c.j.," Okay, we're coming back."
39202,josh,68% think we spend too much on foreign aid. 59% think it should be cut.
39204,josh,Respondants estimate foreign aid to be 15% of the federal budget. It's one percent  of the federal budget. Or it was a half hour ago.
39206,josh,Come here. I lose this vote... I'm resigning.
39207,josh,They won't do it. Not after two continuing resolutions. This expires at midnight.
39210,josh,"Yeah, I though of her. Can she say no to the President?"
39211,josh,"I say she's a Democrat, she owes the President, and there is nothing wrong with  Georgia New England can't fix."
39213,josh,It's not going to be no. Put the senior senator from Colorado in the nay column.  Move Grace Hardin to undecided and start the clock.
39216,josh,"Yeah, you're Bill Bailey, right?"
39218,josh,I'm surprised we haven't met.
39220,josh,We talked on the phone.
39222,josh,I've heard the jokes. What do you need?
39224,josh,"Bill, I know who you are. What do you need?"
39226,josh,"Boy, did you pick the wrong day to write about bipartisan cooperation."
39228,josh,"68% of respondants think we hand out too much in foreign aid, 59% think it should  be cut."
39230,josh,Read me what you got so far.
39232,josh,"Strike ""in their enduring wisdom."" You think electing a reactionary Congress and a  progressive President was wise? The people, in a fog of uncertainty, unsure of the  difference, split tickets across the country. "
39234,josh,"68% say we hand out too much, 59% want to see it cut."
39243,josh,I'm going to try everybody. But Cantina's never voted to send any money anywhere.  I think he's against airmail stamps.
39245,josh,He needs Republican votes on broadband access.
39247,josh,She's a freshman Democrat. She can't say no to the President if he asks her.
39249,josh,"There's a hockey coach who's got a player who's squandering his potential. Coach  says, ""Are you ignorant or just apathetic?"" Player says, ""I don't know and I don't  care."" Yeah, I've seen how foreign aid polls in Georgia. Gracie might be a little  tough to get to the phone today."
39253,josh,My job is to execute the plays Leo calls. The rest doesn't matter.
39255,josh,Are we looking for Hardin?!
39257,c.j.,"Like I said before, the continuing resolution expires at midnight. If Congress  doesn't act, there is no foreign aid budget."
39258,c.j.,"The President wishes the Republican Leader would throw some money at problems  right here, but doesn't wish to help the United States retreat from its role as  a world leader. Foreign aid's been cut 50% in the last decade. In percentage of  GNP spent, we rank not toward the bottom; we are the bottom, dead last. Mark."
39259,c.j.,"The President doesn't beleive that for something this important, something like  that should be taken into consideration. Steve?"
39260,c.j.,We're not responding to a blind quote; we're just assuming you made it up. 
39261,c.j.,I'm not kidding. Thank you.
39262,c.j.,Danny... come back to the office for a second?
39263,c.j.,"He said, ""Lord God, what a tool""."
39264,c.j.,I'm a senior adminstration official. You can say several senior administration  officials say the White House will have a good memory when the transportation bill  comes up next year.
39269,c.j.,What do you think it is I'm going to say?
39271,c.j.,"And sooner or later, you'll find him."
39272,c.j.,"You know, I got to tell you, your tie goes with your shirt, and your jacket... you're  dating a college graduate, aren't you?"
39273,c.j.,"Yeah, I just meant it was a nice tie."
39280,josh," An hour and half, we can't find a U.S. Senator."
39284,josh,"Donna, your job is to take this, find her and stick it in her hand. Make big plays today."
39285,bartlet,We live in an interdependent world and we should act like it. We live in a global  community and we should sustain it. We should cross borders. We should cross borders  to build sustainable democracies that can banish privation and fear. And we should  cross borders to bring food and medicine and roads and schools and teachers to parts  of the world forgotten by all but the warlords. We're gonna pass this Foreign Ops  bill. This should be a century of hope and prosperity everywhere. And America is  going to lead the world and not just bully it. Thank you.
39286,bartlet, What the hell is going on?
39287,bartlet, What the hell is going on?
39289,bartlet,Which is why we can't get her on the phone?
39291,bartlet,"We have many, many backup plans in the works? Josh has broken people into teams and  they're developing and executing rapid-response backup plans?"
39296,bartlet,"Please, my daughter's dating a kid who's better-looking than my wife. I have only so  much RAM to give over to-- C.J.!"
39298,bartlet,"I'm sorry, but once again, there's a cow?"
39300,bartlet,"Yeah, I got that part. It was..."
39301,c.j.,"Heifer Internatinal, it's called. They give milking cows to poor families in developing  nations."
39302,bartlet,And that's great. But a picture of me and a cow...
39303,c.j.,"I have my concerns, sir."
39304,bartlet,Why did you agree to it in the first place?
39305,c.j.,"Well, it's an organization worthy of..."
39307,c.j.,"I'll figure out a way to make the picture work, sir."
39308,bartlet,"Well, good luck with that. Now turn around casually and tell me if Le Vicomte de  Valvert has got his hands anywhere near anyone who's related to me."
39309,c.j.,That is a good-looking young man.
39311,bartlet,"Yeah, I think you'd respond if I stopped feeding you!"
39312,toby,Free food and the gentle lady from Tennessee.
39313,toby,I don't think he was talking about the last half-century. Neither do you.
39314,toby,"Hey, food is apolitical."
39315,toby,"Jimmy, you want to tell me something I don't know?"
39317,toby,Can you be there in half an hour?
39320,josh,"We're at the airport, we're at Dirksen, we're at her house, we're at her gym, we're  at her Senate office, we're at her second office, we're at her lawyer's office,  we're at her husband's office."
39322,josh,The legislative section.
39324,josh,"You say that like constitutional scholars made a conscious choice, weighing checks  and balances."
39326,josh,Are any of those people in this room?
39328,josh,"One wants to save Social Security, the other wants to privatize it. One wants to make  polluters pay to clean up pollution, the other wants to give tax breaks so they can  pollute more. One wants to send aid to countries... "
39337,josh,"He authored a bill to insert the word ""God"" into the Pledge of Allegiance four  more times."
39338,toby,"Yeah, well, once you've broken that dam, what the hell does it matter?"
39341,toby,"You said you wanted 115,000. You meant million."
39343,toby,Out of the federal budget?
39344,toby,And this woman leads a world-class team of psychiatrist?
39345,toby,This is where you draw up a list of sinners...
39346,toby,"Yeah, C.J. got spammed with that a few months ago."
39347,toby,You really want to make a rim shot out of a Secret Service Agent getting dead?
39348,toby,"Dr. Chen, what are you doing here?"
39351,toby,Any of them published in the New England Journal of Medicine?
39366,c.j.,"Well, first of all, that's not a cow. It's not! It's a goat. Yeah, I may have agreed  to something about a goat."
39368,c.j.,Leo... yes. The name of the group is Heifer International. I-I... I was under the  impression it was going to be a cow.
39370,c.j.,"Okay. I think what were going to do is, I think we're going to wait until after the  vote at 10:30, 'cause if we don't win, then it would be a mistake for this picture  to run tomorrow."
39372,c.j.,One from which my job certainly would have hung in the balance.
39374,c.j.," Goats are heifers, too?"
39376,c.j.,"Come on, don't say that! Not even to joke!"
39380,c.j.," So, this is going to be a while. Can you wait?"
39382,c.j.,Of course. We'll find an empty room for him.
39383,c.j.,"Well, you should bring the oats, because the Mess closes at six."
39408,toby,Hey... What's going on?
39409,josh,"Well, Donna tried to flush her out and she did it well, but..."
39414,toby,"Well, you were right, Hoebuck's crazy."
39422,toby,An NIH study on remote prayer.
39424,toby,"Actually, he brought a Duke cardiologist who ran a double-blind...."
39425,josh,"$115,000, he votes yes on Foreign Ops?"
39426,toby,"Josh, it's the federal governmemt investing..."
39427,josh,I don't care if we're investing in communion wafers.
39428,toby,"Josh, it's the federal governent."
39429,josh,We'll deal with the other thing tomorrow.
39430,toby,"Well, I already dealt with it today."
39431,josh,"Not yet, and the clock's running. I'm going to Leo."
39432,bartlet,"There are a couple of thousand miltary families on food stamps. I can't stand it;  the Pentagon knows it. Some families are eligible, some aren't. To change it, they'd  have to raise everyone's pay, which they can't do, and this memo's a reminder. It's a  get-off-our-backs memo. And you thought you were done with turf wars."
39433,bartlet,You decommissioned two aircraft carriers.
39435,bartlet,"Boy, Zoey's growing up nicely, isn't she?"
39436,bartlet,"I'm on your side in this thing, but just barely. Just by a little bit, because  he's French and royal. These are very special, very limited circumstances under  which we're allies, you and I."
39438,bartlet,The letter from the rope line.
39439,bartlet,Put it in my bag tonight.
39441,bartlet,"Mr. McGarry, Mr. Ziegler, Mr. Lyman, Ms. Cregg. It's the Tepmtations. I love you guys."
39445,toby,"James Hoebuck will vote yea 10:30 if we give him $115,000."
39448,bartlet,For an RV? What's he want?
39450,bartlet,I like it. There should a button on my desk I can press and 49 people instantly  pray for me.
39451,c.j.,I got remote prayed for by three million people.
39453,c.j.,Good for me. Can't vouch much for what it was they were praying was going to happen.
39454,bartlet,"Well, that's the problem."
39457,josh,The Earth is rotating rapidly on its axis.
39458,bartlet,"Okay, well, good news. Keep us posted on that."
39459,josh,"We're moving into 8:00 now, sir."
39460,bartlet,Is there something I should be doing I'm not doing?
39461,josh,We should be talking about Jimmy Hoebuck.
39462,bartlet,"Oh, wait. You guys didn't come in here to tell me something funny?"
39464,bartlet," You... you, are the wildcard, my friend, because you..."
39466,bartlet,"...because you will throw out the baby, the bathwater, and the bubbles at curtain  time if it means..."
39468,bartlet,Feel free to interrupt.
39469,josh,"Do you think, Mr. President, the people who get this money care about an NIH study?"
39470,bartlet,"I don't care if they care! I care! And oh, by the way, so do you!"
39471,josh,"$115,000 is what Commerce spends on Post-Its."
39473,toby,Threats to civil liberties only ever come a few dollars at a time.
39474,josh,"It's a medical study. The Nuclear Test Ban Treaty doesn't prohibit radiation therapy.  Sufi Muslims, Orthodox Jews, Indian shamans-- the study says it works with everybody,  so it's not promoting Christianity."
39475,bartlet,"Well, in my faith, we've known it's worked for two thousand years. I never knew there  was data available, but okay."
39482,josh,I apologize for interrupting before.
39483,bartlet,"Oh, I don't care. But what I was going to say..."
39484,josh," I'll toss it all overboard if it means winning, and I think that's  not true, and I'd ask you to support that with evidence... I'm sorry. I don't know  why I keep doing that."
39485,bartlet,You're not willing to toss it overboard to win. You're willing to toss it overboard  to avoid disappointing Leo. You know what the difference is between you and me?  I want to be the guy. You want to be the guy the guy counts on.
39488,josh,We can introduce another continuing resolution... 90 days?
39490,josh,75% of current funding maybe.
39492,josh,"You understand if we introduce another continuing resolution, about ten Democrats  will jump on as a reason to vote no on this. Means losing 60-40 instead of 51-49."
39493,bartlet,"When I lose, I don't look for consolation in the score and I know for sure you don't.  So, it's what we should do, right?"
39495,bartlet,"All right, tough beat. It's an unbelievably tough beat."
39497,bartlet,"Hey, Zoey's growing up very nicely, isn't she?"
39499,josh,"You know, I go for kiss-ass today and the ball goes in the gutter."
39501,josh,"Thank you, Mr. President."
39503,josh,I don't think it mattered. She knows how to count to 51.
39505,josh,Shake it off. And don't listen to the naysayer. You've got a big future as a stalker.
39507,josh,"I just had an interesting moment. I just recommended to the President that he buy a  yea vote for a $115,000 and the Bill of Rights."
39509,josh,"Jimmy Hoebuck wanted to fund a study on remote prayer for $115,000."
39511,josh,"It's getting harder. I'd say we're going to make more enemies in the second term,  but I don't know if there's anybody left on the list."
39515,josh,Is this a real person or a Donna person?
39517,josh,"Not that there needs to be, but... was there a point?"
39519,josh,"Yeah... You're going to need some Kryptonite, by the way."
39523,josh,And we'll steal the rest?
39525,josh,All right. Good work tonight.
39531,josh,"So, if we're lucky, foreign aid's going to be funded for another 90 days at 75 cents  on the dollar. No one who's ever said they wanted bipartisanship has ever meant it.  But the people are speaking. Because 68% think we give too much in foreign aid, and  59% think it should be cut."
39535,josh,"Because 9% think it's too high, and shouldn't be cut! 9% of respondents could not fully  get their arms around the question. There should be another box you can check for, ""I  have utterly no idea what you're talking about. Please, God, don't ask for my input."""
39539,josh," Well, well played, young man. Very good, yes, yes."
39541,josh,"Someone said, ""The best argument against democracy is five minutes with the average  voter."""
39545,josh,"I know the end of the quote. I'll work with you on the legislative section. But  after the vote, okay? We'll get some food."
39555,c.j.,I didn't put the goat in your office. Someone else must have.
39557,c.j.,"I put it in the office that's being used by a new guy Toby and Josh are trying to  give a hard time to-- Oh, wait..."
39561,c.j.,The goat has a handler. I'll get it out...
39576,c.j.,I give them to the homeless.
39577,c.j.,Are you talking through the whole vote?
39579,c.j.,Could you even have this much sensitivity? 
39582,c.j.,We did everything but pass a hat!
39583,c.j.,"You know something there, General Cho? If you had a story, you'd write it. If you don't  have one, shut up. "
39584,c.j.,"We just lost a vote. We're not bumfuzzled. Now if you'll excuse me, I have to cancel a  photo op with a goat."
39585,bartlet,"Tough beat, everybody. Thanks for the work. Next time, we let Josh do it the way he wants."
39590,c.j.,"Good evening, Mr. President."
39591,bartlet,When's this thing with the cow?
39596,c.j.,A milking goat? It's going to seem like a parody of foreign aid.
39597,bartlet,I don't know. I don't know everybody. C.J. wants to cancel the goat picture. Half the  world's people live on less than two dollars a day. 130 million will never step inside  a schoolhouse. Ingredients for bombs can be purchased at hardware stores and we've just  given the Third World what the doctor ordered: rollbacks. Heifer International... they  give free cows and goats to people who need milk?
39599,bartlet,"Well, then, I don't think that we're in any position to be snotty. Let's do it...  Let's do it right now."
39601,c.j.,"So, I think this will work. I think it says, ""Well, you're impoverished and while we  don't care, we don't want you to go away empty-handed, so we offer you this goat, Ron,  to give you milk."""
39603,c.j.,"No, no, of course they don't. So, we offer you this thing that'll just gnaw on your stuff."
39604,bartlet,"I'm not standing in this picture alone. This was a total team failure. Stand where you  want, but I want my Chief of Staff and my Chief Political Advisor standing near the goat."
39609,bartlet,Let's go.  Set that clock for 90 days.
39610,c.j.,"And after the meeting with the council on Foriegn Relations, the President and  the First Lady will be on their way to Camp David for the weekend, where the  Governor of Nebraska will join them."
39615,c.j.,"I'm not really sure, but like pornography, I know it when I see it. They came up with  the title and because it's high school, I felt it was an assignment and I couldn't say  no. Unfortunately, my job prevents me from certain pleasures and I'm not chickening out."
39616,c.j.,No fresh meat for the lions. 
39618,josh,"Thank you. I couldn't go out there. Like they had this sadistic, anticipatory glee."
39619,c.j.,I agree. I have to stay.
39620,toby,What are you still doing here?
39621,c.j.,"Josh can't do the briefings. Anyway, I missed the last flight to Dayton, so it's moot."
39622,toby,Go. I'll do the briefings.
39624,c.j.,"You can't. It's not your schtick. You don't know who to call on, where to look, when  to smile and interrupt..."
39625,toby,Are you scared of that promise thing?
39627,toby,"No, that can't be it. It's your dad. I, sorry. I... uh... How's he doing?"
39628,c.j.,"You're not allowed to use the words ""Alzheimer's"" or ""doctors""."
39629,toby,"Nevertheless, those are the relevant words."
39630,c.j.,"His wife scares me. The woman who takes care of him scares me. Molly, she was my  English teacher. Believe me, she was a very tough grader."
39631,toby,You're scared of your high school English teacher.
39632,c.j.,"Well, she's also now my stepmother, so it's just a little bit fraught."
39633,toby,"Did you ever not get an ""A"" in her class? Nevertheless, Dayton awaits. "
39634,toby,Psst. Finish your speech.
39635,c.j.,"Toby, a couple of things, very important. There's a draft of some notes for a speech  on the National Endowment for the Arts and the President is going to ask for something  maybe over the weekend, and also, Toby, the secion on embassy security... "
39637,c.j.,"No, I didn't mean that you had no social skills Toby. I'm sorry if you think I was  being insensitive to your... I-I think your very... you're a very pretty girl, Toby.  Oh, um, by the way, I have... I have notes about the SEC appointment speech. "
39638,c.j.,I can't do this. I'll call you later. I'm going to have a heart attack.
39639,c.j.,"Toby, if you get this, there's also a errant draft of a briefing paper on the  agricultural training exchange with the South African students and it has to pass  through the... Um, I think I have been maybe cut off. I'll e-mail you."
39641,c.j.,I'm hearing Violent Femmes and thinking Quaaludes and detentions and... tacos?
39644,c.j.,Nor did your purple-and-magenta mohawk.
39646,c.j.,"""Promise of a Generation."" So what are you up to now?"
39647,c.j.,Paris? You were a baseball-playing punk rocker.
39648,c.j.,Thank you. I think that might've been a compliment.
39649,c.j.,"Oh, no. He has a new job now. He gets married. After my mom died-- twice, now to a  lovely lady in the English Department. Her job is baking and hating me. Did you ever  have Ms. Lapham?"
39651,c.j.,Safety in numbers. That'd be great.
39656,c.j.,You want to go fishing tomorrow?
39659,c.j.,I actually don't recall lovi... 
39661,c.j.,Are we going to wake up Molly?
39663,c.j.,I'll be right there. I'm just going to put my bags down and wash my face.
39664,c.j.,About Mr. Moyers. You think he... dad?
39665,c.j.,Mr. Moyers lived in Shaker Heights. The Astro's in Cleveland.
39666,c.j.,"Um, why is this kitchen such a mess?"
39667,c.j.,"Daddy, um, what do you...?"
39668,c.j.,Um... an Italian... custard sauce.
39670,c.j.,We're happy. This is the time we...
39671,c.j.,We get to.... we have a-a window. We get to.. we get to do... actual work for awhile. 
39672,c.j.,No more campaigning. Got it. 
39673,c.j.,"You already... Dad... He wanted to, uh... win. He did so with honor. We played clean."
39674,c.j.,Thank you. You're writing?
39675,c.j.,"That's wonderful, Daddy."
39676,c.j.,Not at all. I'd be happy to.
39677,c.j.,Numerical Idiocy. Cathy title.
39679,c.j.,I think you have to keep whipping.
39681,c.j.,Dad... maybe you need more help.
39682,c.j.,"Yes, but I don't think you're doing as well as..."
39685,c.j.,She left? What does that mean?
39686,c.j.,But this is what's happening. You don't just walk away. This is what's happening to you.
39687,toby,"Yeah, so everything's going well here."
39689,toby,"I, uh, where's the, uh...? I lost the, uh, uh, that NEA thing you wanted."
39690,c.j.,Lost it? It's notes. There's a file?
39691,toby,"Yeah, you needed me to polish a draft?"
39692,c.j.,"Well, there's no draft to polish. That's what I'm saying. There's notes. I don't  have them here."
39693,toby,I'm sure I can find it.
39694,c.j.,"I want to be clear about the briefing, Toby. What I meant when I said that you need  to know who to look at and when to ask certain questions is avoid the calm ones. Get  the anxious ones out of the way first, sweetie, to give the pros room to figure out  what it is they really want. And avoid the ones who don't blink. They're power devils."
39695,toby,I don't know what that is.
39696,c.j.,Yes you do. Is anything happening?
39697,toby,"The usual chaos, but minus ten percent. How are things?"
39698,c.j.,Usual. Uneventful. Daytonesque.
39701,toby,And the wicked stepmother?
39709,c.j.,"""The Promise of a Generation""? Really?"
39711,c.j.,"I prefer to think of your mother as my dad's third wife, Libby."
39715,c.j.,"Why didn't you call me, Molly?"
39716,c.j.,"Shut up! Shut up. You were a wonderful teacher, Molly. You should be ashamed of yourself."
39717,c.j.,"Well, not in your case, though, is it? In your case, more accurately it's the short  ""see you later goodbye"" isn't it?"
39718,c.j.,"What happened to reciprocity? Do you ever imagine in a million years if the roles  were reversed he would ever do this to you? This is-- what you're doing right now--  invalidates everything that came before all the good, the years of teaching. This  cancels a good and valuable life. He needs you."
39720,c.j.,"Dad, you know we need to get some help if Molly won't come back. We do."
39721,c.j.,We would figure something out.
39722,c.j.,"Well, we have to find some way because you being alone won't work out now."
39723,c.j.,The teachers were sexiest men?
39724,c.j.,Thank you. You could hurt yourself.
39725,c.j.,You will hurt yourself. We can afford it. I can afford it.
39726,c.j.,"Have you... done... have you done anything, seen doctors?"
39727,c.j.,"We could arrange to see someone. Lee Voight, he's your friend. He's a terrific  neurologist."
39730,c.j.,Dad... you... cannot expect me to silently do nothing. You're going to require care.
39731,c.j.,Reunion. I'm not going.
39732,c.j.,I'll quit and take care of you.
39733,c.j.,"Stop it, both of you. I'm very upset and I don't want to laugh."
39735,c.j.,"We need to make plans, Lee."
39736,c.j.,"He's too smart, it's no good. He won't be handled."
39738,c.j.,Reunion. I'm not going.
39739,c.j.,They came up with it. I agreed because I wanted to be here to see you.
39740,c.j.,You could come and live in Washington with me. I have room.
39741,c.j.,I know why you started smoking again. It's because you use the time it gives you to  work stuff out. You use the cigarettes to stall for time. 
39745,c.j.,Please tell me everything's okay.
39746,toby,All quiet in the West Wing. 
39747,toby,What's all that honking? You in a parade? They having a parade for you?
39749,c.j.," Pull over, I'm driving. Pull over."
39750,c.j.,"I mean... tell me... things like your checkbook, your money, things like that-- what  do you propose to do? Tell me. You're smart, tell me."
39751,c.j.,"Oh? If we drove for 3 hours at 40 miles an hour? I mean, tell me! You are holding on  to something that... "
39752,c.j.,"...can't be willed away by sheer force of personality, dad."
39753,toby," The same is the same, and the same is true for the bailout of the iron industry.  Nothing was said that has not been... that has consistently not been said and is still  being not said. And what's, what's, what's not being said is often uh, more important  than-than, uh, what's stated particularly by Congress."
39755,c.j.,"Yeah, they kind of do. "
39756,c.j.,"Dad! Dad, can you get the door?"
39757,c.j.,"No, Dad, no.  He gets confused. Dad, no, wasn't... Marco... wasn't in prison."
39762,c.j.,Oh... Bill Morton form debate. Julia Keller from Cheerleading. Liz Varney from tennis.
39763,c.j.,I don't think I can... face it right now.
39764,c.j.,"After dinner, before the scary dancing."
39765,c.j.,"Mmm! I'm like, I'm like on in a few minutes."
39767,c.j.,What am I about to find out?
39769,c.j.,"Are you saying you're one of those people who think like, in F. Scott Fitzgerald, their  best years were 20 years prior?"
39770,c.j.,"My name is C.J. Cregg. As you know, I work for the President of the United States.  This is why I was asked to make a short speech for our reunion. It's a terrible  subject, a terrible idea, ""The Promise of a Generation."" So bad, I was going to  start out with a joke and fill the whole thing in with more jokes. But I find the  topic has gotten under my skin while I wasn't paying attention, because every  generation has promise, and every generation fails that promise in some respects.  How can we not? What is promise if not something that's impossible to live up to?  My boss had to recently make his case to the American people that he was worth  re-electing, and it was... not an easy process, nor should it be. And in its wake,  I've been thinking a lot about civility, civic duty, and kindness, and how pervasive  and powerful they are, how enduringly persuasive those qualities are in American life,  and how I see them all around me, day after day. America is a terribly difficult idea  filled with promise and impossible to live up to. Promise is inchoate and promise is  what binds us. "
39771,toby,Something happened. Turn on CNN.
39772,c.j.," I hope it's monumental and not some joke timed for the exact moment I'm  giving my speech, Toby."
39773,toby,"It is. Two car bombs outside our embassies in Asia. One went off, one didn't.  A message to expect more of the same within the next 24 hours: Four."
39775,toby,"No casualties, thank God. If you can try and-and get back, uh... There are no direct  flights, but if you connect out of Chicago, you can be in, we think, at 6:30 in the  morning."
39776,c.j.,Um... let me get moving. I'll call you in a few minutes on my way to the airport.
39778,c.j.,"I'm sorry, I have to go. There's been... We have... I'm sorry. I..."
39779,c.j.,"Some bombing threats to embassies. I'm sorry, I have to go. I have to ge to the  airport and get back to D.C."
39780,c.j.,"I have to go. Tal, I-I don't know what to do about this situation."
39782,c.j.,I'll see you next week.
39783,c.j.,"Good morning, Mr. President."
39784,bartlet,Why are they talking to me about the order of the balls?
39785,c.j.,Political Affairs thinks it's important.
39786,c.j.,Aren't we about to demonstrate that pretty clearly right now?
39787,c.j.,The President has a driver's license.
39788,bartlet,"Well, that's only going to be clear if we also hand out decoder rings. Listen, it's  an Inauguration Ball. Let's enjoy ourselves."
39789,bartlet,"Thanks, ladies and gentlemen."
39790,c.j.,"Actually, it's eight Inauguration Balls."
39792,c.j.,Every draft all night long.
39793,bartlet,You haven't weighed in.
39794,c.j.,"I just did. Anything else, sir?"
39801,josh,Just buzz. They know there's a restatement of foreign objectives. They know the  committee chairmen haven't been consultated.
39803,josh,They know it changed a lot overnight.
39804,bartlet,"Well, their curiosity will be slacked in about 41 minutes. Listen."
39807,josh,"Well, you're about to propose the most massive shift in foreign policy since the  Marshall Plan, and it's going to be wildly unpopular."
39808,bartlet,"All right, two problems."
39812,bartlet,"I kept changing my mind all week on which bible I wanted to use, and then I finally  settled on the George Washington Bible but we ran into a problem with the New York  Freemasons, which we don't have time to get into."
39814,bartlet,"Yeah. Charlie's out hunting one down, but he's not back yet."
39815,josh,"You know, there's nothing that says you have to be sworn in on a bible."
39817,josh,You can be sworn in on a Sports Illustrated swimsuit Issue.
39818,bartlet,You think that's a good idea?
39823,josh,"We're right next to you, sir. Knock 'em all down."
39826,josh,"Hey, Leo, can you tell me anything about what happened to Jack Reese?"
39834,josh,I told her all that in no uncertain terms.
39838,josh,She's not here. I can't find her. I don't think she's coming. I'll find out where  Charlie is.
39848,bartlet,"Yeah, I may need to get a room."
39850,bartlet,"No kidding. In the last two minutes, three people have reminded me what Jefferson  said in his Inaugural."
39852,bartlet,"The problem is that when he said it, your best chance of getting entangled with an  ally was by rowboat."
39857,bartlet,They didn't have one in the House Library?
39860,c.j.,That's when the Chief Justice will ask you to raise your right hand and place your  left hand on the Bible.
39862,c.j.,You raise your right hand and put your left hand on the Bible.
39863,bartlet,And will there be someone who'll tell me when it's time to do that?
39867,bartlet, Can we pull foreign policy up on the prompter?
39868,toby,"144 on the prompter, please. It's going to take a second."
39870,toby,"The Chief Justice-- wrote a dissenting opinion in Sea Northern v. Arizona, saying  that an association between asbestos and a higher risk of cancer in later life was  insufficient to merit relief."
39872,toby,He...  I don't know how to say this. He wrote it in meter.
39874,toby,He wrote a dissenting opinion in what I am almost certain is trochiac tetrometer.  Will?
39876,bartlet,What are you talking about?
39877,toby,He starts in the fourth graph.
39878,bartlet,"""Fear of cancer from asbestos, fuzzy science manifestos."""
39879,toby,A guy just faxed this to Will.
39882,toby,"It's a loud syllable followed by a soft syllable, which is a trochaic foot, then  there's four per comma, which is tetrameter."
39883,c.j.,You think he's trying to tell us something through code?
39884,toby,"144's on the prompter, sir."
39885,bartlet,"""America cannot be the world's policeman. America cannot enforce its own values, its  own standards across the world. Yet when it's in our clear an vital interests...""  We're being candid at least."
39886,toby,This is State Department language.
39887,bartlet,"No kidding. Look, I understand I present a uniform gap, but I want to mean what I say."
39888,toby,"Will, you're going to meet with my counterpart, the State Department Communications  Director. He likes to have input into foreign policy language."
39890,toby,I would really think so.
39892,bartlet,The Chief Justice wrote a poem.
39898,bartlet,You think he stayed to long at the fair?
39902,bartlet,This foreign policy language is ridiculous.
39904,bartlet,What's going on in Khundu?
39906,bartlet,"I got a short security cable this morning about civil unrest in the Republic of  Equatorial Khundu, and I had to reach for an atlas."
39912,bartlet,They're being evacuated?
39918,bartlet,And they need several days notice?
39920,bartlet,Are they not sure where it is?
39921,bartlet,I'm going to be using the Bartlet Bible. That's at the New Hampshire Historical Society.
39927,bartlet,"I can't remember your name, but are you asking me out on a date?"
39940,josh,Could you hang onto mine for me till Sunday?
39944,josh,"God, Donna, please tell me that's not going to be the only thing he's wearing."
39946,josh,I'll be wearing a tuxedo from Gary's. Who's been on the phone?
39948,josh,They decided to change the foreign policy language 20 minutes ago. How do they  know already?
39950,josh,The President's asked Toby and Will to look at the language.
39952,josh,Keep the President out of it. I've asked Toby and Will to look at the language.
39956,josh, I don't want to know how you know that.
39957,bartlet,"No, he was talking to me, your Eminence.  Your Excellency, I got a very  sketchy intelligence report on the violence in the capitol about an hour ago."
39988,toby,"I throw a rubber ball against the window, that means you come to me."
39990,toby,"As my frustration level grows, so does the velocity of the ball against the window."
39994,toby,Did you ask for transcripts of public remarks from Manchester?
39998,toby,And the 14 other cartoons outside.
40000,toby,So we're dumping State's language?
40002,toby,Which means we'll need some of our own.
40004,toby,"I'm talking to myself right now, so there's no reason for you to be answering."
40010,bartlet,Just as the disciples intended.
40011,bartlet,The Jefferson bible doesn't warp?
40012,bartlet,"Probably. Speaking of New Hampshire, don't I own the Bartlet Bible?"
40014,bartlet,And they won't loan it back to me so that I can be inaugurated?
40015,bartlet,Yeah. His name is really Mr. Cravenly? You're not making that up?
40016,bartlet,"Okay, would you tell him that I'd like very much to use my family's Bible, which my  family has bought at least twice now."
40017,bartlet,"You know, a couple hundred people got killed today in Khundu."
40018,bartlet,The Arkutu control the government and they're killing...
40022,bartlet,Yeah. Ask Bob Slattery to come over here.
40023,c.j.,"At that time, the Chief Justice will ask the President to raise his right hand and  place his left hand on the Bible."
40026,c.j.,"Well, I guess we'll find out six days from now, but thank you to the Smothers Brothers. "
40029,c.j.,"Stop trying to get us together, okay? If I wanted Danny, I could have him. And he's  still a jackass from the foreign Ops vote and many other things, so tell him I'm  getting my hair done."
40030,c.j.,There was no way you could tell me he was right behind me? You couldn't fit that in? 
40035,c.j.,"If I help you find the cricket player, you'll consider it a favor and not the White  House cooperating with your story?"
40037,c.j.,Is there anything else?
40040,bartlet,"Bobby, what's going on?"
40041,bartlet,The Catholic Church has better intelligence than we do?
40043,bartlet,How many are dead right now?
40045,bartlet,"Bobby, I don't want to make noise but I want to see a forced depletion report.  I want to know how many we'd lose and I want to do it without going three rounds  in the newspaper with Miles Hutchison. Who do we have at the Pentagon who could  do this for us?"
40047,bartlet,Tell him I want to see forced depletion on a peacekeeping force in Khundu. And tell  him we'll do our best to keep it away from the Secretary's office.
40049,c.j.,"First things first. We're going to have to learn how to pronounce it. I learned it  as ""Kuhn-doo."" The Republic of Equatorial Khundu."
40055,c.j.,"No, I didn't know that."
40057,c.j.,The White House is monitering the situation very carefully.
40064,josh,"Wondering whether the Nuclear regulatory Commission really needs $100,000 for a  ""morale improvement program."" It's got to be a pretty critical lap dance."
40074,josh,Most of the homes and offices of the people who live on this planet.
40076,josh,What's he doing showing you a fax from the Commander of the Seventh Fleet?
40080,josh,How do you know what he was showing you?
40082,josh,Are you serious with these questions?
40084,josh,"Then let it strike you that way, and please find out what they mean by ""morale  improvement program"" so I can get back to-- you know-- actual people."
40085,bartlet,"Hey, I changed my mind about the Bible."
40086,bartlet,I don't know. I never... it just seems parochial. I hate saying that.
40087,bartlet,"There's a Bible in North Hampton, Masachusetts, that Johnathon Edwards used. Let's  get that."
40089,bartlet,"""Grace is but glory begun and glory is but grace perfected."" I made my Bible selection."
40099,bartlet,And I'm worried about the White House making that suggestion.
40103,bartlet,"All right, listen. I've asked for a forced depletion report on action in Khundu."
40105,bartlet,Slatterly got Jack Reese.
40107,bartlet,"The best scenario is that simply by engaging, the Arkutu lay down their weapons,  but that doesn't seem likey, so we'd lose people."
40109,bartlet,More if they go into the countryside.
40124,toby,You're not thinking about policy language?
40126,toby,Because we have five days.
40127,toby,You really comfortable going through life with a name like Elsie Snuffin?
40128,toby,"Well, the idea isn't going to walk in here and announce itself as being important  and take a place on the top of the pile."
40136,toby,"Define those values for me, please."
40138,toby,"Just out of curiosity, how are you going to enforce a universal global right to  education?"
40139,toby,"What exactly are you doing here, anyway?"
40142,toby,"I read it, I think, 16 years ago. It was about El Salvador and he had it stricken  from the record and there was a reason."
40144,toby,"I don't know, but things have reasons."
40148,toby,You're talking about Khundu? That's what the hell this is about?
40150,toby,This isn't what I meat by drafting new language.
40152,toby,"Making the old language sound better. You're asking the two of us to create foreign  policy by ourselves. That's usually not a good idea. You've got your Pentagon, the  NSC and-- what do you call it?-- the State Department."
40154,toby,This language proposes a new doctrine for the use of force. That we use force  whenever we see an injustice we want to correct. Like Mother Theresa with  first-strike capabilities.
40156,toby,"Oh, you've had too many dinners with daddy. Please go back to finding new language  for the foreign section!"
40161,toby,"You're wrong. And if he did, I'd be fired shortly thereafter."
40163,toby, You go back to doing whatever it is you do.
40170,bartlet,"The First Lady has to hold this in her hand. This one's going to take the First Lady,  the Chief Justice and the Second Circuit Court of Appeals."
40172,bartlet,"Sorry. Thanks. Charlie's going to take care of you.  Charlie, that Bible's  the size of a Volkswagon. Can we get the Washington Bible?"
40192,bartlet,Toby been taking his pants off again? That's just something he does.
40198,bartlet,Yeah. What's hard is that foreign policy has become a statement of what we won't do.
40200,bartlet,"""A new doctrine for a new century, based not just on our interests, but on our  values across the world."" Well, that's pretty spicey stuff."
40202,bartlet,"Yeah, I know. Why is a Khundunese life worth less to me than an American life?"
40208,bartlet,Talk about the very model of a modern Major General.
40210,c.j.,I found your ramp signal agent.
40211,c.j.,"We don't send anyone anywhere who doesn't work for us, but I understand he's gotten  a salary-bump and he's co-captian of a local cricket team."
40215,c.j.,This is ridiculous. It's been ridiculous ever since you came back.
40216,c.j.,Would you mind if I turned out the lights?
40217,c.j.,It's just easier this way. For three years I have been thinking about what might  have been if it weren't....
40219,c.j.,"And I'm almost over it. I mean, I am right there and you come back with scruffy face  and your jokes and your incredible talent and your way of getting at... getting at me.  And I was thinking if we could... "
40220,c.j.,Do you like this perfume?
40221,c.j.,Do you like this blouse?
40224,c.j.,Remember when you asked me what exactly I'd do to have you?
40226,c.j.,"Good evening. I have revised estimates for Khundu. We said 15,000 yesterday.  Intelligence reports are putting it closer to 25... 25,000."
40230,josh,You're sitting with us in the staff section.
40231,josh,Would it be weird if I just walked around with a military dress saber?
40232,josh,Okay. He's in a security briefing?
40233,josh,"Navy dress uniform has 13 buttons on the pants. I mean, traditions tradition, but  I'd be concerned about the level of bladder discipline that requires, wouldn't you?"
40235,bartlet,We'll send condolences. What's next?
40237,bartlet,"Well, if he's old enough to marry Jerry Lee Lewis, I guess he's old enough to be  king of Bhutan. What's next?"
40239,bartlet,"What's happening? I'm sorry, what's happening in the REK?"
40240,bartlet,"Well, a proclamation ought to do the trick. What's the CIA know that I should know?"
40242,bartlet,"Yeah. Hey, I changed my mind. Not the Washington Bible."
40244,bartlet,"Yeah, I'm going to use my father's."
40246,bartlet,Did you talk to Hutchinson?
40248,bartlet," Tell Josh I'll just be a minute, okay?"
40249,bartlet,Did he tell me to shut up and let him run the Pentagon?
40253,bartlet,So Hutchinson know I've seen forced depletion.
40255,bartlet,"He should be pissed at me, not Jack Reese."
40257,bartlet,Don't worry about it. Right?
40261,bartlet,Clark says neighbors are swapping family members in Khundu.
40263,bartlet,"Also, there's a new king of Bhutan. And he's been bar mitzvaed and everything."
40265,bartlet,"Hey, this guy you hired for the Inauguration speech gave me a little back chat a  few minutes ago."
40267,bartlet,"Yeah, he was using a floor speech about El Salvador I gave 98 years ago to demonstrate  that the U.S. should send troops to Khundu. Rhetorically, I said, ""Why is a Khundunese  life worth less to me than an American life?"" And he said, ""I dont know, sir, but it is."""
40271,josh,"Good evening, Mr. President."
40272,bartlet,"Hey, Josh. There's intelligence that Khundunese neighbors in the country are swapping  family members."
40273,josh,"I'm sorry, I don't understand."
40274,bartlet,"For the night, they're swapping family members you know, and sleeping in each other's  houses."
40277,josh,"You know what, nothing I can't deal with."
40279,josh,I did just get off the phone with Jeffrey Tomlinson and Bob Bibbet.
40281,josh,"They're under... I'm sorry, sir, they're under the impression that the entire  foreign policy section is being rewritten."
40283,josh,"I know, they just... asked me to emphasize that the current language has been vetted  with the ranking members of House Armed Services."
40284,bartlet,The language is being polished.
40285,josh,That's what I told them. They just asked me to remind you that their version also  reflects existing treaties some of which....
40286,bartlet,"Some of which have my name on them. So tell Jeff Tomlison and baby Bob to take a  deep knee bend, would you? I'm just as big a cotton candy ass as they are."
40288,bartlet,You're just going to let that hang in the air?
40289,josh,"Of course not, sir. You're a much bigger cotton candy ass than they are."
40293,josh,"Thank you, Mr. President."
40304,josh,The reality of the fast-track Navy guys is they're going to bop around the globe a lot.
40306,josh,"You can't begin to concieve of the internal politics of the Pentagon. Right now,  Hutchinson and his boys..."
40308,josh,"Well, no one's told me about it and I'm not going to ask."
40310,josh,Three doors you definitely want to knock on to complain about your boyfriend being  transferred to the Italian Alps.
40314,josh,I ask you that because sometimes people request transfers.
40318,josh,Jack Reese got transfered.
40319,josh,If you tell me you got a crush on Reese...
40321,josh,Isn't his name Jean-Paul?
40323,josh,Intelligence says neighbors in Khundu are sleeping in each others houses.
40324,josh,It means they're making people in the same house rape each other on the promise  their lives will be spared.
40327,toby,"During moments of peak frustration. When the Speaker of the House threatens to repeal  the 16th Amendment. A couple of Yankee games. And there was the time Congress censured  my boss. But it's always held up, that window. That window's a game-day player."
40329,toby,Leo was just in here.  What did you say to the President last night?
40331,toby,I know. What did you say?
40335,toby,Didn't we talk about this?
40337,toby,But you gave it a shot anyway?
40341,toby,"The Dow plummets because of casual conversations with this man, but that's not the point."
40343,toby,You can't get in his head this close to something this important. You've got to keep  the train on the tracks.
40345,toby,"No, no ""but"" at the end of that. Not on this one. This one haunts him. It haunts everyone."
40351,toby,"Okay, keep the ancient Romans out of the first ten rows, and we're fine."
40355,toby,The U.S. doesn't help create freedom from tyranny?
40357,toby,The watchword of all mankind? I don't know what the means.
40359,toby,"The speech is good. It's better than good. There's one paragraph that's vague, and we're  going to live with it. "
40363,toby,There were maybe four people in the room when I had that conversation.
40366,c.j.,"Ghana, Nigeria, and what did I say?"
40367,c.j.,"Ghana, Nigeria and Zaire. The Arkutu meet with representatives from those countries.  They met for three hours, and we're told the talks were amicable but that no progress  was made. Steve?"
40368,c.j.,The problem is the Convention distinguishes between acts of genocide and genocide.
40371,c.j.,Two below with the wind chill. That's a full lid. Good night.
40373,c.j.,"Danny, I have no idea. I have no idea what the distinction is. All I know is I got a memo  from State-- close your notebook-- a memo from State to make sure not to call it genocide. "
40374,c.j.,"No, we're not going to do that anymore. We're not going to talk about Shareef."
40378,c.j.,"Nobody takes me seriously when I say ""good day, sir."""
40379,c.j.,Did you find the pilot?
40380,c.j.,I can't remember his name.
40382,c.j.,You don't even want to say you were wrong and apologize for your superior attitude lately.
40384,c.j.,The President hasn't rescinded any Executive Orders.
40385,c.j.,"Tha President appreciates it, and it's not like it's anything new. I don't know who the  Jets are and who the Sharks are, but it's Fitzwallace and Hutchinson."
40386,c.j.,Josh's office. You can get it from Donna.
40387,c.j.,"Hey, what are Executive Orders 11...?"
40390,josh,"C.J. says there are three references to ""mankind."" Can we make it ""humankind""?"
40392,josh,"Foreign Relations would like ""war"" changed to ""war and strife""."
40394,josh,"Where we say, ""tens of billions wasted,"" the OMB would like us to say, ""billions and  billions wasted."""
40396,josh,Then that's all for me.
40399,toby,All right. Let's leave the building. What do you say?
40400,josh,Anyone playing at Iota tonight?
40401,toby,I don't know. Let's just go. Ask C.J.
40402,josh, There's that club called Iota in Arlington. They usually have some good people.  You want to come out?
40404,josh,Ginger or Bonnie will do that.
40407,toby,He's frustated with the foreign polciy section. He wanted to change it.
40409,toby,No. U.S. foreign policy. Hang on. Will?
40411,josh,"Listen, the President takes seriously the question of whether or not to risk American blood."
40413,josh,He can't just send people someplace.
40415,toby,"No. ""Do what we can to fulfill humanity's promise."""
40417,toby,No. Leadership wants to cut it.
40419,josh,It doesn't. The voters do. The voters that you champion and that I can't stand.
40421,josh,What's his level of frustration?
40423,josh,He's here on a temp job. He's that invested in...? 
40424,josh,"This never happened before, has it?"
40427,bartlet,"Charlie, I'm going to change my mind again on te Bible."
40428,bartlet,Aren't you afraid that one day I'm just going to kick your ass like it's never been  kicked?
40429,bartlet,Let's go with the Washington Bible.
40430,bartlet,Just put it on a plane.
40431,bartlet,What do the Freemasons have to do with it?
40434,bartlet,Are you trying to tell me that Freemasons don't like me?
40437,bartlet,I saw C.J. smiling before. Has something good happened?
40445,bartlet,"Well, then it was a dodged bullet."
40451,bartlet,You think in your wildest dreams that Hutchinson's running an offense? He's that pissed  that I asked for forced Depletion Report he's going to show me in Danny's byline I go to  Khundu and here's what happened in Bermuda?
40453,bartlet, Abbey's already gone to bed. I should get up there.
40461,bartlet,"Abbey, the kids are eating sugar. "
40463,bartlet,"How you doing? You know I gave the kids candy all the time, right?"
40467,bartlet,"Well, it was for sale, and I wanted it."
40469,bartlet,I'm going to stay up for a bit and read and watch some news.
40471,bartlet,His grandkids were in here?
40477,bartlet,Frederick the Great told his generals... to defend everything is to defend nothing.
40479,bartlet,"I don't really know what that means, do you?"
40481,bartlet,"Well, that makes two of us."
40485,bartlet,I was their dealer. Live with it.
40488,josh,"Uh, two. Cynthia, I left a message for Donna. She might call."
40489,c.j.,The guy across the street is beating up a pregnant woman. You don't go over and try  and stop it?
40490,toby,"Guy across the street is beating up anybody, I like to think I go over and try to stop  it, but we're not talking about the President going to Asia or the President going to  Rwanda or the President going to Qumar. We're talking about the Preisdent sending other  people's kids to do that."
40491,c.j.,"That's always what we're talking about, and in addition to being somebody's kids,  they're soldiers and sailors, and if we're about freedom from tyranny, then we're about  freedom from tyranny, and if we're not, we should shut up."
40493,toby,"Back at the office, you were telling Will..."
40494,c.j.,He said that to Will 'cause that's what we say.
40496,c.j.,It's what we always say.
40497,toby,"On Sunday, he's taking an oath to ensure domestic tranquilty."
40498,c.j.,"And to establish justice and promote the general welfare. Stand by while atrocities are  taking place, and you're an accomplice."
40499,toby,"I'm not indifferent to that, but knuckleheaded self-destruction is never going to burn  itself out, you really want to send your kids across the street into the fire?"
40500,c.j.,Want to? No. Should I? Yes.
40501,toby,Why? And don't give me a lefty answer.
40502,c.j.,A lefty answer is all I've got.
40503,toby,Why are you sending your kids across the street?
40504,c.j.,"'Cause those are somebody's kids, too."
40506,josh,"I'm not talking about fighting two wars at once, I'm not talking about fighting wars.  Intervening when there's violence against people who are defenseless..."
40507,toby,"Fine, but if we go here, then that means they can go there, and look, there's more  injustice over there."
40508,josh,"We elect these people. And not for nothing, but if'd had been the world's policemen  in the 30's, you and I..."
40509,toby,We would have had a lot more relatives.
40511,josh,Where the hell is Donna?
40512,toby,Leave her alone-- she's having a last night with... What's his name?
40513,josh,"I called her at Jack's, and I paged her."
40515,c.j.,I've got to bo back to the office.
40517,c.j.," Danny screwed me, and somebody on one of our staffs screwed the  rest of us."
40518,toby,I'll get the call.  This is Toby.
40520,toby,"Well, Will's never been called in the middle of the night by the office of the President.  I think he should experience that before he leaves."
40526,c.j.,"This is, A] it was garbage. That was... that was totally out of left field on the piece  on the unnamed White House source..."
40527,c.j.,"What do you mean, it wasn't yours?"
40530,c.j.,Without your knowledge?
40531,c.j.,And you're okay with that?
40532,c.j.,What was the name of the researcher?
40533,c.j.,"No, the researchers looking out for his future. He's twenty-three and times a-wastin'.  I want to give him a Lexus. What's his name?"
40535,c.j.,Asking how many nuts and bolts doesn't get this quote.
40536,c.j.,I sent you to Donna when you asked...
40537,c.j.,"No, but that day, yesterday, her boyfriend Jack Reese, a Navy Lieutenant Commander,  was reassigned from a White House poistion, and she was very angry about it."
40538,c.j.,They're not on the record!
40540,josh,"Well. This is gonna, I think, get interesting now."
40542,josh,This is gonna get interesting.
40543,toby,It will capture our interest...
40544,josh,...and will be written about...
40545,toby,"...in English, I would think as well as..."
40547,toby,You can say that two times. I suppose you can't blame Will completely.
40549,toby,This is entirely your fault.
40551,toby,You like Europe. He likes Europe. You could have talked about Europe.
40553,toby,"Than make it the subject. He says, ""here's this El Salvador speech I gave a long time  ago,"" and you say?"
40556,c.j.,"Listen, something's happened."
40558,c.j.,A White House aide is quoted in tomorrow's Post.
40560,bartlet,"We're for freedom of speech everywhere. We're for freedom to worship everywhere. We're  for freedom to learn... for everybody. And because, in our time, you can build a bomb  in your country and bring it to my country, what goes on in you country is very much my  business. And so we are for freedom from tyranny everywhere, whether in the guise of  political oppresion, Toby, or economic slavery, Josh, or religious fanaticism, C.J.  That most fundamental idea cannot be met with merely our support. It has to be met with  our strength. Diplomatically, economically, materially. And if pharoah still don't free  the slaves, then he gets the plagues, or my cavalry, whichever gets there first. The  USTR will go crazy and say that we're not considering global trade. Committee members  will go crazy and say I haven't consulted enough. And the Arab world will just go  indescriminately crazy. No country has ever had a doctrine of intervention when only  humanitarian interests were at stake. That streaks going to end Sunday at noon. So, if  you're on board with this, what I need you to do..."
40561,toby,"What we're going to do is comb through the language again, this time with counsel."
40562,c.j.," Carol? It's me. I'm going to need new talking points for the full Cabinet,  no embargoed excepts..."
40563,toby,"We have to move from a lone rogue, to a posse."
40564,bartlet, Do I just keep standing here?
40567,toby,"All right, everything else off the table.  What were you going to say before? "
40569,c.j.,Danny's got a piece out tomorrow on fault lines between the White House and the Pentagon.
40570,toby,He writes that story twice a year.
40571,c.j.,"A researcher gathering background spoke to three people, one of whom was Donna, because  your office is one of the places that keeps breakdowns of how Pentagon staff are detailed  to the White House. The researcher was giving an unprompted quote, which he gave to  Danny's editor, who put it in the piece."
40573,c.j.,"Everyone's very loyal to everyone else around here, unless you wear a uniform."
40574,josh,"I know it sounds like it was Donna 'cause of the situation with Jack, but there's no way  she gives that quote to a reporter."
40575,c.j.,She didn't think she was on the record.
40576,josh,There's no way Donna said that.
40577,c.j.,"She did. She just called me and told me she did, which I give her credit for."
40579,toby,Heat of the moment. And bad timing.
40580,josh,I don't have time for this now.  Neither do you.
40581,bartlet,"""Set free the oppressed, break every yoke, clothe the naked and your light shall break  forth like the dawn, and the glory of the Lord shall be your rear guard."""
40587,bartlet,"Well, then here's to swimmin' with bow-legged women."
40589,bartlet,"I think you're wrong. But if you're right, then okay. We should all have a little skin  in this."
40591,bartlet,So we're doing well so far.
40596,bartlet,"Not because, no. Not because of Laurel and Hardy. That was simply the confluence of  the final, you know, and... also, by the way, from the mouths of babe-- like yourself.  Seriously, from the mouths of babes and clowns come-- Listen, there's no reason why  anyone needs to know about Laurel and Hardy."
40598,bartlet,Too cold for a parade. Bunch of tanned-ass Southerners.
40600,bartlet,Which is to the south of New Hampshire. Don't tell me geographic stereotypes.
40602,bartlet,I walked to school every morning in weather colder than this.
40604,bartlet,"That's right, baby. Just a camel hair coat, leather gloves, a varsity scarf and these wits."
40606,bartlet,What is the problem? It was in New York. It could have gotten here on a fast horse.
40609,bartlet,And it didn't come in last night...
40610,bartlet,Three for the freemasons and one for the Bible.
40611,bartlet,Three hotel rooms and four train tickets.
40612,bartlet,"Okay. You know what? Washington didn't bring his own Bible, he just assumed one would be  provided, which, frankly, isn't unreasonable. Guy wants you to swear an oath on a Bible,  he ought to be packing a Bible. Washington had someone get one from across the street."
40613,bartlet,"Just common courtesy I think. ""Place your hand on this Bible."" And, ""Oh, can I use your  Bible?"" That's not right."
40614,c.j.,"Good morning, Mr. President."
40615,bartlet,Why are they talking to me about the order of the balls?
40616,c.j.,Political Affairs thinks it's important.
40617,c.j.,Aren't we about to demonstrate that pretty clearly?
40623,c.j.,They're yuckling him about the order of the balls.
40624,c.j.,That's the U.S. Marine Corps Band right there. The Commandant's Own. These guys practice  four hours a day. So you think the Chief Justice has lost his mind.
40625,toby,"I didn't say he's ""lost his mind,"" I said... I said he lost his mind and Leo said he's  lost his mind."
40628,c.j.,A literary curse.  Five minutes.
40629,josh,He doesn't have a Bible. Charlie's out looking for one.
40632,c.j.,So there it is. Let's see what happens now.
40634,toby,I told him to have a bad meeting with that Public Affairs guy.
40636,toby,That's exactly what I was going to say.
40638,toby,"Except the part about him working under the radar in his house on the phone. Leo, I  want the President to appoint him Deputy."
40640,toby,I can talk to the people at State and--
40646,toby,"A promotion-- it's well past time. Make him a Senior Counselor, take the knucklehead  stuff off his desk, the way he did for me for four years. Let him concentrate on the  President and the country."
40651,josh,She's sitting in her apartment in a ball gown.
40652,josh,She doesn't think it's appropriate for her to be here. I couldn't talk her down.
40655,josh,I haven't read it. Sorry. I haven't.
40656,josh,You're walking around with a copy of it? 
40657,josh,"Give me that.  Yeah, here it is. ""Said one White House  aide, 'We've got a situation--'"""
40658,josh,"""...'where the White House won't give the D.O.D an extra ten billion so they have to  go to the Hill and get it.' Said the same aide, ""Everybody's very loyal around here  unless you wear a uniform,'"" said the same aide. I hadn't read the first part of the  quote. Said the same aide? I'm going to kill her."
40659,toby," We're just going  to be a minute, right?"
40662,josh,"It's good cop/bad cop. I'm the good cop; the four of you are the bad cop. Will, what  are you?"
40668,josh,"The bad cop, that's right. Here we go."
40671,josh, The buzzer's not working.
40674,josh,The buzzer's not working. There's a note that says the buzzer's not working.
40676,josh,"No, I know women. I know what they're like.  Donna!"
40683,josh,Don't even think about telling me to keep my voice! Get down here!
40685,josh,"Oh, no, I'm sorry. Didn't mean to wake you guys. Uh, this is a special situation. It's  okay, I'm the good cop."
40686,toby," Hi, National Inquirer?"
40687,josh,You come down here without a coat?
40690,josh,"You don't know the White House rejected ten billion for the D.O.D. You have absolutely  no way of knowing that. Jack said it. The researcher called Jack, and Jack said it."
40696,josh,He's letting you take credit for this?
40698,josh,Your career isn't important? What was the point of anyone claiming... You knew it was  easy... to figure out it was him.
40700,josh,"The list of things you didn't think about, including your job, what the President  thinks of you."
40702,josh,He's about to. You look amazing.
40707,josh," Hey, hey, hey. Good cop/bad cop."
40710,josh, We're going to a ball.
40712,josh,We're actually going to eight of them.
40714,josh,"I was actually the one who hit the window, the rest of them went to school on my throw."
40718,toby,This is what I've been telling you. Get in the car.
40720,josh,You're going to have to sit on somebody's lap.
40723,c.j.,You should expect increased voices of dissent after today - in breadth and depth.
40725,c.j.,It's doubtful Danny's inquiries about Shareef would have gone further if he didn't have  new sources at the Pentagon.
40729,c.j.,"That it was given hours before Shareef's plane disappeared... Just a reminder, the more  I know, the more I can help you. And don't be concerned with my exposure. I'm not your  daughter. I'm the White House Press Secretary."
40733,bartlet,"They're saying I'm rewriting the Constitution on the back of a napkin. They're saying  on FOX that a guy who couldn't run a local sheriff's department wants to send troops  around the world. They're saying it's liberalism with a grenade launcher. But they're  not saying it was badly written, so that's something. And they sure as hell know I was  serious, so that's something else. Congratulations, folks. We've got ourselves a doctrine. "
40734,bartlet,"Will, I think some of these people don't know who your dad is. Will's the youngest son  of Tom Bailey, who's the only guy in the world with a better title than mine. He was  Supreme Commander, NATO Allied Forces Europe. We didn't know we were going to do this.  I would have asked you to invite him."
40736,bartlet,"Actually, I meant he could be here now when I tell you Toby's asked me to commission  you as his deputy."
40738,bartlet,Toby wants to make you deputy.
40740,bartlet,I'm appointing you Deputy Communications Director. It covers a wide range of areas of  policy and execution and counsel to me.
40745,josh,"I remeber when you named me Deputy, there was a dull buzzing in my ear, or a humming.  It was very disorienting."
40746,c.j.,The same thing happened to me.
40747,josh,"Hang in there Will, you're doing fine."
40749,josh,What did I say about speaking to me without addressing me as Wild Thing.
40751,bartlet,Hi.  Sam's going to be promoted to Senior Counselor if  he loses the 47th.
40753,bartlet, That's what you want to hear from your new Communications--
40755,bartlet,There's a promise that I ask everyone who works here to make. Never doubt that a small  group of thoughtful and commited citizens can change the world. You know why?
40757,bartlet,"William Bailey, reposing special trust and confidence in your integrety, prudence and  ability, I designate you to the post of Deputy White House Director of Communications  and Special Assistant to the President. And I do authorize you to execute and fulfill  the duties of that office with all the powers and privileges and subject to the  conditions prescribed. It is affirmed by my signature... "
40758,bartlet,...and affixed with the Seal of of the Unites States. 
40759,bartlet,And it is done so on this day and in this place. 
40761,bartlet," You know, it's easy to watch the news and think  of Khundunese as either hapless victims or crazed butchers, and it turns out that's not  true. I got this intelligence summary this afternoon. ""Mothers are standing in front of  tanks."" And we're going to go get their backs. An hour ago, I ordered Fitzwallace to  have UCOMM deploy a brigade of the 82nd Airborne, the 101st Air Assualt, and a Marine  Expeditionary Unit to Khundu to stop the violence. The 101st are the Screaming Eagles.  The Marines are with the 22nd M.E.U., trained at Camp Lejuene, some of them very recently.  I'm sorry, everyone, but this is a work night."
40764,bartlet,"I don't understand, did we just get put on call waiting or something?"
40765,bartlet,Wendall's answering the phones at U.S. European Commamnd?
40776,bartlet,I can tell by the way you laughed in my face at the suggestion that I was.
40780,bartlet,I've told him over and over about money and endorsements from outside the district.  Why is he going to Brentwood?
40784,bartlet,"The right to privacy's a value, so is clean air."
40787,bartlet,"Deficit-nuetral, we've had 14 meetings."
40789,bartlet,What's wrong with booze and a comfortable pickup? Scoring.
40791,bartlet,"Is there going to be a democrat tax plan, or am I going to be stuck in NEC scoring  hell for the rest of my term?"
40793,bartlet,What do salmon runs have to do with it?
40795,bartlet,Last week it was a banana embargo. Is Congress opening a restaurant?
40797,bartlet,Aren't there quite a few reasons?
40800,bartlet,Leo said just now that there was going to be an NEC briefing on scoring and tell her  what I said.
40803,bartlet,"Mr. Ambassador, I'm sorry to keep you waiting. I was just in the White House Situation Room."
40804,bartlet,"I've just taken your airport...  ...clearing the way for the 101st Air  Assualt to take the capitol. 7,000 troops, 25 battle tanks, 15 Apache attack helicopters,  and three destroyers. Strictly speaking, I conquered your country without the paperwork."
40805,bartlet,"No, it's not. It's in the midst of a one-sided slaughtering of an entire people. Both  the Secretary General of the United Nations and the Vatican have pleaded with President  Nzele for a cease-fire and both the U.N. and the Holy Father have struck out to the peril  of 115,000 Induye men, women, and God knows children, particularly the boys."
40806,bartlet,"The heads of Ghana, Nigeria and Zaire have similairly sent packing. The Red Cross has been  denied entry on three seperate occasions in the last ten says. President Nzele has 36 hours  to give the command to his troops to hand over their weapons to the 82nd Divison Airborne  Division of the United States Army. At 36 hours and one minute, I give the order for the  101st Air Assualt to take Bitanga and run up our flag. I skipped breakfast. Anybody want  coffee or something?"
40807,c.j.,The President informed both Ambassador Tiki and President Nzele that they have 36-- now  34 and a half hours-- to implement a halt to the violence before U.S. forces deploy. John.
40808,c.j.,You've got a Pentagon briefing at noon. Katie.
40809,c.j.,"The government of Ghana as offered to act as an intermediary, and those talks begin  within the hour."
40812,c.j.,"Yeah, I don't get to decide press policy for the U.S. Armed Forces, though if wishing  made it so, but we're bring Pentagon Public Affairs on the California trip and we'll  be meeting about it all weekend. Tonights forecast for D.C. is 18 degrees of Mercury.  For Newport Beach, it's 78 and sunny."
40814,c.j.,"Well, Sam's going to meet us and we're going to get something to eat."
40815,c.j.,"Don't be fooled. They love us in Orange County. They're crazy-go-nuts for the President.  They're really the Democratic party in general. I think they really like it when we come  to town. When we were there last month, we we're working the crowd, and some boys,  worried possibly that I couldn't afford fruits and vegetables on a government salary,  tossed me some of their own. "
40816,c.j.,"78 and sunny. Yeah, we're going to have a dabba-doo time, so unless there are any  updates, I'll see you on the plane."
40817,c.j.," I've got $1,331 in my checking account. I'll write you a check for $1,300  if you go to California instead of me. Just leave me $31 for food and transportation."
40818,c.j.,"That, by the way, was a sky-blue DKNY suit worn for 41 minutes. There should be a law  against that."
40819,c.j.,Who was she bumped for?
40822,c.j.,"All right, let's see if we can get Gretchen in front of the Times and..."
40823,c.j.,Wait a second. Rittenhouse and Gacey?
40824,c.j.,It's the tax plan. Josh!
40825,c.j., We need to  see the President.
40826,bartlet,"Right. On the other hand, 20% of your youth is unemployed. They're just living to live."
40827,bartlet,"Yeah, it helps when someone else is picking up the bigger ticket items like a national  defense."
40830,bartlet,"Yes, absolutely, send them in."
40831,bartlet,"Yeah, whatever, hang on a second.  What do you need?"
40832,josh,"Sir, we didn't know you were busy; we'll wait outside."
40833,bartlet,"No, that's all right. What do you need?"
40834,josh,The three of you should bond.
40836,bartlet,"If you leave, I'll kill you."
40838,bartlet,"I'm sorry, Jean-Paul, I'll have to cut it short. Josh has gotten himself in a jam. But  I'll see you on the plane tonight, and I'll look forward to continue the discussion on,  you know, what's wrong with me."
40840,c.j.,The chair of House Ways and Means and Senate Finance are doing the Sunday shows.
40841,bartlet,You think the Republicans are rolling out their tax plan?
40845,bartlet,'Cause we can roll out ours and I don't have to sit through another seven scoring meetings.
40846,josh,But it means they're going to announce their tax plan this afternoon or this evening.  That's tomorrow and Sunday before we respond.
40847,bartlet,"Why not respond Saturday or Sunday? Better yet, let's go first. Call the press in, and  I'll do it right now."
40848,josh,It's not ready yet. It's still being scored.
40850,toby,I don't like that French kid very much.
40851,bartlet,It'll be ready tomorrow?
40853,bartlet,"I say we respond to theirs with ours, but we do it tomorrow or Sunday."
40854,toby,You'd be announcing a one-percent tax increase on the richest one percent and doing it  in Orange County.
40855,bartlet,Then that's where we do it.
40857,josh,Which is why I think we should cancel the trip.
40858,bartlet,And announce from the White House.
40860,c.j.,Won't the White House canceling the trip be taken as a signal that we've given up on  the 47th?
40862,c.j.,And do equal damage to the campaign?
40864,josh,You want to go to Orange County?
40865,c.j.,"I think we have to go.  Even though there's $1,300 with your name on it if  you don't make me go with you."
40866,toby,"Get over the dress, would you?"
40867,c.j.,It was a suit and they hit me with an avocado.
40868,toby,It could've been worse.
40870,toby,They could have hit me.
40871,c.j.,"Sir, the first 24 hours of the cycle are critical. We can't fight something with nothing  and that's what we'll have for 48 hours after they announce if we don't announce too."
40872,bartlet,That's a killer decision. But let's lean towards Sam and say we keep our mouths shut in  California and then come out fighting Monday morning.
40873,josh,"Thank you, Mr. President."
40876,toby,Every speech the President gives on Tuesday has to be about the Democratic tax plan.  How many public remarks is he making on Tuesday?
40878,toby,Plus we need speech inserts for the Cabinet.
40880,toby,"Yes, you can, because you're going to use the staff to help you."
40882,toby,"Your staff-- the White House speechwriting staff. Your staff. You will tell them what you  need. You will expect it. You will tell them how they can do better, and they will do it."
40890,toby,"No, no, no, they don't like you at all."
40892,toby,"Don't know; more to the point, I don't care."
40894,toby,"They've been working for the President forever. You've been here three minutes, and  he made you a deputy. They have whiplash."
40896,toby,And I'm surprised they haven't come around yet.
40898,toby,Listen to me. Many of these are the lowest possible priority remarks. There are more  valuable places for your time. Now instruct your staff.
40930,toby,I'm going to go with him.
40932,toby,We though it was going to be...
40933,toby,That's what I thought we were talking about. I didn't even realize the 15%.
40934,toby,"Oh, my God. Have you been on the plane the whole time?"
40935,toby,What are you doing here?
40936,toby,And I told you you couldn't fly.
40937,toby,"Listen to me. We've got all kinds of atmospheric cabin pressure up here. We're a little  late, so the Colonel's put the hammer down in a 747. You've got windshear, downdraft,  massive turbulence, not to mention four giant engines burning jet fuel at galactic  temperatures. We're standing in a flying death tube! "
40938,toby,"No, not the rest of y-you. It's just my family. It's, it's fine.  Look..."
40939,toby,"Also, you've got twins in there. You're basically a minivan. How are you fitting into  a seat?"
40945,josh,I don't know. I don't know him. Find out if he's for real before I meet with him.
40949,josh,"Well, to begin with, is he wearing shoes and shirt?"
40951,josh,"Ask him what he thinks of Richard Sutter. He's an Assemblyman who proposed the Foreign  Labor... It doesn't matter. If he doesn't have a strong opinion on Sutter, he doesn't  play at your level."
40953,josh,"You do. It's not a lot to speak of, but you know, no shoes no shirt, I'm sorry, but  you draw the line."
40956,c.j.,We've begun spreading our magic already.
40958,c.j.,Some wires got crossed between the Advance and Airlift Operations and CHP on the ground. They didn't get the word until late that take-off had been delayed and they also thought  we were coming into SNA and not Los Alamitos.
40960,c.j.,Interstate 5 has been shut down for an hour and a half.
40961,josh,Is that a freeway that gets used a lot?
40962,c.j.,"Not for the last hour and a half, no."
40963,josh,"All right, has the President seen any of the news on the Republican tax cut?"
40964,bartlet,No response from the White House?
40967,bartlet,15% cut across the board? Cutting capital gains 50%!
40968,toby,And they said it would cost $800 billion.
40969,bartlet,And it's actually going to cost?
40971,bartlet,"I'm not an economist, but no... Wait, I am an economist. So, their plan will do what, C.J.?"
40973,bartlet,"Explode the deficit. Will it stimulate the economy, Josh?"
40974,josh,It will stimulate the Swiss economy.
40975,bartlet,"Josh gets extra credit for being funny and right at the same time, and how long do I have  to stay quiet, Toby?"
40976,toby,"You're the leader of the free world, sir. You can speak anytime you like."
40978,toby,"No, for that you got to shut up for 50 hours."
41013,toby,74 degrees in February. There's no civilization here.
41017,toby,"Yeah, I fired some of them."
41021,toby,"I was thinking about what you said this morning, and I think they have a bad attitude.  Also, they're pretty bad at their jobs."
41023,toby,Just as soon as you hire them.
41027,toby,You can't. That's why I left you a staff.
41029,toby,"Tell them what you want, and then expect it."
41031,toby,They're bright young women. Show some leadership skills. Get it done. We're here.  I'll call you in a little bit.
41048,bartlet,"Man, I'm sorry about this. "
41050,bartlet,"The French have denied us access to their airspace. I'm not sure why they think we're  going to need it to get from here to Africa, but what the hell. This weekend's all  about you. Get up there."
41051,bartlet,This is going to be about France. Did we accidently trap people in a theme park?
41070,toby,We got off to a rough start.
41072,toby,Don't worry about the campaign.
41074,toby,Don't worry about it. How are the remarks coming?
41077,c.j.,"Well, there are some nice shots of you and the President, but the one you're going to  see a lot of is you kissing a liberal, pregnant, unwed congresswoman."
41080,josh,The Journal's attacking him for campaigning at the same time he's sending troops overseas.
41082,toby,They minded he insulted the French?
41083,c.j.,"Or ""poncy hairdressers,"" it's not clear..."
41085,c.j.,"So, you'd rate the trip so far, what, B, B-minus? C-minus? We'll get it together."
41092,c.j.,"I think Holcomb's been making bad mistakes with you, Sam. I think Josh's been right."
41093,toby,I know Josh has been right and if you think that's easy for me to say...
41094,josh,He's got you with business.
41096,josh,Has a Democrat ever won Orange County?
41098,josh,Then how would he know?
41100,josh,"I wasn't trying to get under his skin. On the other hand, I didn't really care that  I had, you know what I mean?"
41102,josh,"Some polls that have you within seven. If you only lost by seven, that would be huge, man."
41162,c.j.,Sure. He's getting continuous updates. He's also spoken by phone today with the UN  Secretary-General and the leadership of the World Bank and the IMF to begin discussing  rebuilding packages after the Arkutu stepdown.
41163,c.j.,He'll have a conference call with his economics team.
41164,c.j.,"The tax plan isn't a response to the Republicans, it's a tax plan, and yes."
41165,c.j.,A series of meetings upstairs in his suite. The California leadership of the FOP the  Governor and the State Assembly Leadership on matching payments before he goes on to  the fund-rasier.
41166,c.j.,Was a White House aide sent to meet with the Communist Party's candidate for governor?
41167,c.j.,"No, Donna Moss was sent to meet with the head of the California Agricultural Laborers  Association, a man named Ivan Perez, who, it turns out has some loose ties to the  American Communist Party."
41168,c.j.,"Like that one. Mr. Perez was heard, as he certainly has a right to be, and that's that."
41169,c.j.,"Really, really well. I'll talk to you before the dinner. Thank you."
41178,toby,Did I tell you to worry about the speeches or did I tell you to worry about Sam's campaign?
41180,toby,Read me what you've got for the swearing in of the Ambassador.
41182,toby,"Okay, you're going to polish that up?"
41184,c.j., You and Josh need to take over the campaign.
41186,c.j.,Just for the last week.
41187,toby,"We've asked. We said we'd go off the White House payroll. I've had to bungee Will to  his desk. Until higher authorities steps in, the DNC wants Holcomb."
41188,c.j.,When they have him in community centers at a podium...
41190,c.j.,...it looks like he's wearing his dad's old suit. He's got youth and vitality. He should...
41194,c.j.,"Sir, you are way out of line, and we're having a private conversation, but thank you..."
41195,toby,"Okay, sir, you're standing too close now."
41196,toby,"Yeah, it's the father and you're standing too close, so, if you're going to insist on  being drunk and minding other people's business, you've got to take a step back, 'cause  as you are apparently aware, the Congresswoman is pregnant."
41200,toby," Excuse me, Officer, ballpark-- How long  do you think this is going to be?"
41201,toby, Tell him he's got to hit hard on quality-- health care quality-- and in  his acknowledgements he's got to...
41202,toby," In his acknowledgements, he's got to mention the  AFL folk. The President's working the..."
41203,toby,The President's working the rope line for 15...
41204,toby,No. Charlie says no on the rope line.
41205,toby,"And if you can call the NEC and get a one-pager on trucking faxed to me in my cell,  I'd really..."
41206,toby,Okay. I got to go. I'm under arrest. 
41207,toby,Does he ever know the names of the people's he's meeting?
41208,toby,Is there any chance I could get a corner cell or anything possibly with a loft?
41228,bartlet,Uh-huh. And what did Charlie do?
41230,bartlet,Toby and Charlie were arrested in a bar fight.
41231,josh,"Yes, sir, it's not going to be a problem. C.J.'s taking care of it."
41233,josh,It's going to be a little bit of a problem.
41234,bartlet,Everytime we come to Southern California we are absolutely the Clampetts.
41235,josh,He booked him at the Newport Beach Chamber of Commerce. He had him skip a union lunch  without telling restaurant employees...
41237,josh,"He wants him speaking at Cal Lutheran. Scott Holcomb's given up on Sam, and he's running  his own agenda. Now, I can't leave with the tax proposal coming out, but Toby says he  can for a week. Evidently, Will's put together a top-flight staff that can handle the  paper for a week. And I suppose it's worth mentioning that Toby probably can't leave the  state anyway. Now, as the leader of this party you..."
41238,bartlet,You really don't want to shake up a campaign like this at this point in the election  calendar.
41239,josh,"At this point in the election calendar look which way his numbers are going. I'm amazed  he's kept a veneer of sanity, much less..."
41249,bartlet,"Guys, we've got to keep our voices down a little."
41253,bartlet,Why are you putting Sam next to business?
41257,bartlet,Tell Toby to take over the campaign.
41258,bartlet,"Yeah.  Leo, I just fired Scott Holcomb. Toby, who, with Charlie, is meeting  with a bails bondsman right now, has to come off the payroll for a week."
41262,bartlet,What do you mean they've been taken?
41264,bartlet,We secured the airport.
41270,bartlet,Tell Ghana to tell Nzele he's got 9 hours and 20 minutes before I take him.
41277,toby," Well, Sam's on his way over, and I'll tell you something, if I was  someone who felt comfortable hugging other people, I'd give one to Sam 'cause he  absolutely impaled himself. So I think the least I can do is bring the Ziegler brand  of wisdom to the campaign for the last week, be a role model. By the way, you know  what they don't tell you? You can post bond with a credit card."
41278,toby, Yeah. Charlie's trying to throw down with the street. It's kind of a  sad sight to see.
41280,toby," Yeah. Uh, uh, when do you land?"
41281,toby," Excuse me, I think they're making me buy somebody's house. Uh, call me  when you land."
41282,toby,"I'm sorry, I can't remember who I borrowed this from."
41285,toby,I'm sorry I missed your rally. That was a hell of a thing you did with the tax plan.
41287,toby,I meant it was really stupid.
41293,toby,"Couple of country club guys were a little lubed. They got into it with Andy. I wanted  them to step back, and he slipped, and his wingman thought I hit him, so he came for me,  and I took care of business."
41294,toby,Charlie took care of business.
41296,toby,"Hurricane, we were in the joint for two hours and 20 minutes, 'kay?"
41298,toby,"No, I just got off with Josh, and I'm running the campaign for the last week."
41300,toby,"He was taking it in the wrong direction, Sam, and you know it."
41302,toby,"We made a rough entrance here, but things are looking up now."
41304,toby,"Look, a glass is half full or half... You know, the other thing..."
41310,toby,You're really going to be teaching the seminar on call girl caution? Really?
41312,toby,Nothing. It's a box on page 27.
41314,toby,"They got the hostages, the President heading to Washington, a flood in Colorado and a  chemical fire in Providence. We got saved."
41315,toby,"All right, I called that putt too early."
41316,bartlet,"How come it's never people with six months to live who are taken hostage? I mean there's  so much of it, you'd think once in a while we'd catch a break."
41319,josh,The First Lady's going to fly out to California tomorrow and do the President's public  events. Would you let C.J. know that she should stay? She was going to take a red-eye back.
41321,josh,"Also, Charlie should stay and staff the First Lady."
41323,josh,"Yeah, Max is taken care of."
41325,josh,"Well, I guess I'm really suppose to do it myself."
41327,josh,"You took a meeting with a Communist, Donna."
41329,josh,Yeah. Fair enough. My bad.
41333,bartlet,Would you all excuse me?
41336,bartlet,"What happens if, screw the deadline, we just go to full deployment right now?"
41338,bartlet,"All right, we got to go get them."
41340,bartlet,"All right, then, on my order."
41361,toby,It made the news out there?
41363,toby,"The President's coming out with his tax plan tomorrow, not Monday."
41365,toby,"Sam found out we were holding back 'cause of his campaign, and made the President flip  the cards a couple of hours ago, so the toothpaste's out of the tube, and we're going  to need to be ready with public remarks by the end of the day tomorrow."
41370,toby,I'll call you in an hour.
41371,toby,"No, actually you're not. The First Lady's flying in tomorrow and taking over the  President's events, so she needs to be staffed."
41372,toby,Advance is bringing it over to you.
41373,toby,"Yeah, she's still here."
41374,toby,"All right, Amy, how much money does he have left?"
41375,toby,Yet with regard to money you remain...?
41377,toby,Will they write checks this late?
41379,toby,"You're eight points down with ten points up for grabs, and you need them all to break  for you."
41381,toby,"Yes. Well, look, it's been one of those days. Who would've thought Charlie could bust  us out of the Newport Beach Correctional Facility using nothing but his shoes. Go ahead,  tell them, Charlie."
41384,josh,"Yeah, I think 80 million is pretty unrealistic from the House. Didn't-- last year--  didn't the conferees split the differnce, like 68-something?"
41385,josh,"All right, we'll tell them the budget submission's at 80, and everyone's happy at 70.  Do we have anything else?"
41386,josh,"Max, there's no more 12 million."
41389,josh,You get a daily memo on Hill consultations.
41391,josh,"Well, I'd have someone else do it, but it's up to you."
41403,josh,"You're very stealthy, ma'am. I've always liked that about you."
41405,josh,How are you this morning?
41407,josh,"I haven mentioned this in a while, ma'am, but I think you and the President are a  perfect couple."
41409,josh,"Me, too, but at the end of a prize fight, you look at the guy who's dancing around,  and that's who won."
41411,josh,"Well, can I ask you, ma'am, why do you think?"
41417,josh,The President and Leo make their decisions by listening to and participating in vigorous  debate. This isn't school. I work with people who can play.
41421,josh,Because I won-- I always do-- and you came here for my advice.
41425,josh,"No kidding. He doesn't understand the budget process, he doesn't understand committee  structure, he thinks decisions are made in meetings..."
41427,josh,"...and he can't play at this level. Mrs. Bartlet, you're the First Lady, you need a Chief  of Staff, a real one. If you want your agenda taken seriously, put a professional face on it."
41430,toby,"When they ask you why you're here today, you say, ""Orange County's beachfront is national  treasure."""
41432,toby,"Charlie McCarthy was the dummy. Edgar Bergen was the ventriloquist. When they ask you  about the rise in the Consumer Price Index, you say, ""Orange County's beachfront is a  national treasure."""
41438,toby,"And when they do, here's what you say: ""Orange County's beachfront is a national treasure."""
41440,toby,"I doubt you'll sound like anything. They'll just use it b-roll. But on the off-chance  there's audio, you might as well be on message."
41441,toby, Sam will take some questions now.
41447,c.j.,He looks youthful and energetic. Do we have anything he can jump over?
41449,c.j.,What's going on at the White House?
41450,toby,"I'm standing right here, I don't have special powers of... When you brief the press,  that's when I'll know."
41451,c.j.,"You've never been on a beach in your life, have you?"
41455,bartlet,Is the three-year-old in there?
41456,bartlet,This is my first time doing this particular one.
41457,bartlet,"Good morning, I'm Jed Bartlet. Mr. and Mrs. Hernandez?"
41459,bartlet,"Mrs. Halley, is it all right if I call you Diane?"
41461,bartlet,Are you three years old?
41463,bartlet,"Don't be. Diane, do you mind if Betty sat in the next room with my secretary, Ms. Fiderer?"
41465,bartlet,Yeah. It was taken off of Kundunese TV.
41467,bartlet,"I'm afraid so, sir, yes. We're currently negotiating for Red Cross access so they can  get medical attention."
41468,bartlet,"I'm sorry, I can't tell you that."
41469,bartlet,"I'm sorry, I can't tell you that either."
41470,bartlet,"Mr. Hernandez, I can only imagine..."
41479,bartlet,Why the CIA wet team? We're not near water.
41480,bartlet,I had to ask. What's it called?
41535,josh,Did you say immunization education?
41536,josh,I didn't move anything.
41538,josh,This isn't what we had this morning.
41539,josh, I don't know. Did I proofread it?
41541,josh,..to make sure it reflected the changes we agreed to? I didn't do that.
41544,josh,Whoever moved the money knows that I don't proofread these things.
41545,josh,Max doesn't know anything.
41546,josh," Boy, really leaving no stone unturned, aren't ya?"
41548,josh, Read me the rest of the fax.
41550,josh,How did she... Read me the fax. 
41554,toby,"You know, I think I've got..yes, yes I do, I've still got sand in my shoes from like six  hours ago."
41557,toby,"You know, I'm looking at this wire report. Why's the First Lady commenting on falling  soybean prices?"
41558,c.j., That's what they were asking her?
41559,toby,Why'd you let her take the questions?
41560,c.j.,"In retrospect, that's what a lot of us are wondering. "
41561,c.j.,I don't think that's a good idea.
41563,c.j.," 'Cause it's a black tie event. And when she talks about poor  women wearing a $4000 Mercritia dress, she looks like Marie Antoinette."
41565,c.j.,"I am. So, you should tell her that, Charlie."
41566,c.j.,You should tell her not to talk about the House vote.
41567,c.j.,I once had to tell the President he was wearing two different shoes.
41569,toby,Those are recommendations.
41571,toby,They're recommendations. Say what you want.
41576,c.j.,Good luck. We'll catch up with you later.
41578,toby, That's what we're doing.
41580,toby,You don't wanna be a flamethrower?
41582,toby, Good. You feel alright?
41585,bartlet,At what point do we start to worry?
41586,bartlet,Hack was 2 hours and 47 minutes.
41587,bartlet,"Yeah, but it's four hours and ten minutes now. I've got three parents, a wife and a  three-year-old up there. At what point do I tell them what's going on?"
41589,bartlet, Ask him to confirm it again.
41597,bartlet,It was a suicide bombing.
41598,bartlet, I want Threat Con Charlie for Africa and Europe.
41599,bartlet, Why don't you go talk to the families?
41618,toby,"Hey. Sorry. I didn't catch that last part, you were walking a little fast. "
41620,toby,"I didn't want a half-empty rally, and the wired workers are wired to Webb."
41622,toby,Your concern is that those people are gonna stay home and do laundry on Election Day.
41626,toby, Can we get a couple of shots and a glass of beer?
41632,toby,'Cause that's how you get 'em to sing.
41634,toby,"No. The story's going to be that you actually stuck up for what you believed in, you  didn't cut and run. And people are gonna remember that, I'm gonna make sure of it."
41640,toby,"You're gonna lose, and you're gonna lose huge. They're gonna throw rocks at you next week,  and I wanted to be standing next to you when they did."
41647,toby,You're not imagining it. 
41650,toby,God Bless the President of the United States and Sam Seaborn.
41653,bartlet,"Oh, okay. I didn't ask for five?"
41654,bartlet,She's allowed to do that?
41657,bartlet,"Yeah, what the hell's going on?"
41659,bartlet,"I know and when she called me at five, I was going to say call me back in an hour and  go back to sleep. I was going to do it myself."
41661,bartlet,"Yeah, and now I missed the whole thing."
41663,bartlet,Operation Resting Eagle.
41665,bartlet,"You know I was having a little fun in my sleep. It's how I relax. Wait, let me put my  glasses on. Something's turning me on about you, and I can't tell why."
41669,bartlet,I got in late last night.
41671,bartlet,We didn't even leave Nashville until after ten. I ended up touring a weapons research  facility in Oak Ridge. They've got one of the most powerful reactors in the world.  They were able to show me an insulin molecule. Basically scoop up two zinc ions. 
41673,bartlet,You're a scientist and your still making fun of this?
41675,bartlet,"Anyway, look, I'm trying to tell you something."
41677,bartlet,"You know what? That's okay, I'm going to get that."
41679,bartlet,"No, I'll get them, thanks."
41680,bartlet,"Lay out the papers, yes, and today I'd like you to alphabetize them."
41682,bartlet,"Anyway when we finally got back from Nashville, Leo was waiting."
41684,bartlet,I don't know but we're going to be interested in that less right now than we are in  other things.
41686,bartlet,Foreign Ops came out of mark-up.
41688,bartlet,It's good. They only cut two billion and shifted half a billion from the Sub Saharan  to Western Europe because I guess the crippling hunger in Provence has given the  lactose intolerant a problem with-- I don't know but I can live with all that.
41690,bartlet,Clancy Bangart attached an amendment. 
41692,bartlet,Stipulating that Foreign Ops dollars wouldn't go to any overseas clinics that council  abortion.
41696,bartlet,This is the Senate. They can do that.
41698,bartlet,"No, there was no indication. Clancy Bangart doesn't let me know what he's thinking."
41700,bartlet,"There's a handful, a handful and a half of cranky conservative Senators who want this  stuff, and were waiting to pounce. It's what happened."
41710,bartlet,I'm not prepared to do that yet.
41714,bartlet,I'm not prepared to do that yet.
41716,bartlet,I know what the gag rule is.
41718,bartlet,"That's great except people are starving to death, and they're dying of disease to death,  and they can't cook the Bill of Rights."
41720,bartlet,"I really don't know Abbey, the day hasn't started yet."
41721,josh,"This is from David Elsin from the USGS-the US Geological Survey-and the Coast Guard  Commander Dennis Travis, ""Last night at 3:45 a.m. Battletree Lake burst through its  natural dam in what is known as a 'glacial lake outburst"". Okay, it's a rushing river  of ice and water and rock. It's about 300 feet wide and it's sweeping through Kachadee  which is a town on one of the sides of the lake."
41727,josh,"No, I'm trying to brief you on a state of emergency in Alaska."
41729,josh,We have an agreement with Canada and Russia on for mutual assistance in Artic airborne  rescue so I think the President's going to need to get on the phone or at the very  least be briefed.
41731,josh,"The dam was part of a glacier, and the glacier melted."
41735,josh,"I don't know anything about geology. I think it's been melting for a long time. But,  yeah, 3:45 this morning was the straw that broke the camels back."
41739,josh,"Well, I would, Leo, but a glacier melted this morning, so at this point Americans are  simply trying to outrun it."
41743,josh,"A glacier in Alaska melted. You're going to see this on the news in a second. I'll help  you prep C.J., but a natural dam broke, there was flooding, and there's going to be a  lot more. "
41751,josh,"C.J., talk to C.J.  He got called by The Globe about Captain Feathersworth."
41755,c.j.,Well at Marion Cotesworth-Haye of Marblehead certainly.
41759,c.j.,"He wasn't a pirate, he was a privateer."
41761,c.j.,"Yeah, but he worked for us, and he was hired by the fathers of the Daughters of the  American Revolution."
41763,c.j.,It's not our job to tell things to Mrs. Marble-Haye.
41765,c.j.,He was a privateer; he wasn't a pirate.
41767,c.j.,"All right, I think it's time for a visit to the First Lady's office."
41771,c.j.,But close wasn't good enough was it?
41795,c.j.,"Yeah. Anyway, Mrs. Helena Hodsworth Hooter-Tooter of Braintree wants to organize a  boycott of the reception and, well, there it is. Yes, Mrs. Bartlet descends from quite  the murderous band of ruffians, and her membership in the DAR is suspect on those  grounds or so believes the Boston Globe."
41798,toby,You were in the building?
41799,toby,Good to meet you. You're working for Kierney-Passaic?
41800,toby,"Mm-hmm, but what do you sell?"
41801,toby,And you're testifying for Polluter Pays?
41803,toby," ""You demonize companies that create..."" You think taxpayers should pay to  clean up pollution instead?"
41804,toby,"That's nice to know, but tomorrow we've got 15 scientists who aren't on industry payroll,  and you'll have..."
41805,toby,"Yeah, well, that's got to help."
41811,toby,Burt are you defecting?
41812,toby,"They're due in May. It's a boy and a girl. We can't decide on names. She likes Rebecca  or Sophie for girls. I like Sophie too, but I think a lot of kids are named Sophie now.  And I like Rebecca, but I also like Millicent and, which she doesn't like at all, and  we're nowhere with boy's names."
41813,toby,"But they say it comes to you, and we've got a little time. We're still working on it. "
41818,josh,I got a call that said that--
41820,josh,Who are those two guys talking over there?
41823,toby,"This is Josh Lyman, it's okay."
41824,toby,This is Burt Gantz. Burt's the... what's your title again Burt?
41825,toby,He's testifying tomorrow on Polluter Pays.
41826,josh,"I've, I've read your testimony."
41828,josh,His testimony's been written already.
41830,josh,So we just saved the committee a lot of time.
41831,toby,He wants to change his testimony.
41836,josh,So Kierney-Passaic's not been damaging the environment quite so much as they've been--
41837,josh,Stay here and don't say anything to anyone till I call. Who knows he's here?
41841,josh,Is it true that everything fell off your wall?
41843,josh,"Okay, but I don't think orientating is a word. Do you have an assignment?"
41844,josh,"Donna, I need to speak to someone from the Council's Office."
41846,josh,Attached a global gag rule to Foreign Ops and the first Lady's fershnicked.
41851,josh,You think I like it more than you do?
41853,josh,He should veto his own bill?
41855,josh,If he does then he has to veto.
41856,josh,"Yeah, but if Amy's plan of magic and wonder doesn't he's got to veto Foreign Ops after  not one, two, but three continuing resolutions. We need a win and 230 million people  overseas need a sandwich so he can't veto Foreign Ops. Donna! "
41858,josh,They tried to attach it to everything in the last four years and we've beaten it back  every time with executive orders but this one's going to be law and we have to eat it.
41859,josh,Why did your stuff fall off the wall?
41862,josh,Did you get me in with the council's office?
41864,josh,"All right, after lunch then?"
41866,josh,"Hey, you know how you really want to go to the DAR reception tonight?"
41868,josh,Well you're going. The Secret Service needs us to baby-sit someone. One of the Daughters  of the American Revolution is also the daughter of the ranking member of House Armed  Services.
41870,josh,"Not her, her date. Matthew Lambert, 26, was arrested when he was 21 and a senior at  Emerson. He was arrested for selling drugs and found guilty of a felony and the Secret  Service won't let him in unless someone who's credentialed is watching him."
41872,josh,"Yeah, and he won't know why, so try to be cool."
41874,josh,Or his girlfriend I would think. After lunch with the council's office?
41876,josh,"If you want but don't tell him we regard him as a security risk. It's just, you know,  inhospitable."
41917,c.j.,She's coming right now.
41918,c.j.,Yes. We think we solved your problem.
41919,c.j.,Marion Cotesworth-Haye of Marblehead.
41921,c.j.,"Not a problem at all, because we have her here."
41922,c.j.,Here in the Mural room.
41923,c.j.,Turns out she came to Washington.
41924,c.j.,"What do you care? Just go in there and talk it through, and if you feel like that isn't  working, tell her the First Lady wants to give her an award tonight."
41925,c.j.,Save yourself the headache.
41927,c.j.,I did. I did put olives in his jacket but this is on the level.
41929,c.j.,I got to make sure I don't laugh.
41930,c.j.,"It's a funny name to me, that's all, just give me a second. Hang on. Okay."
41932,c.j.,"I'm C.J. Cregg. My assistant spoke to you on the phone. Mrs. Cotesworth-Haye, I'm  C.J. Cregg. I'm the White House Press Secretary. This is Will Bailey our Deputy  Communications Director and Amelia Gardner, who's the First Lady's Chief of Staff.  And this is her first day as a matter of fact. We're so happy you could take the  time to come over so we could talk this through."
41933,c.j., I'm sorry. I was... I was... thinking of this thing  from... this thing that just happened... with the deficit. I'm sorry...
41934,c.j.,I swear it's not a hazing. It's real. It's real. I just laughed 'cause of the name.  You've got to fix it.
41937,c.j.,You know what happened? I didn't have my game face on.
41938,c.j.,"Anyway, problem solved."
41939,josh,"Hey, is it true your office doors fell down? "
41940,josh,"The guys from Army Counter-Intelligence get a bunch of boys, I don't ask questions."
41943,josh, She really doesn't so everything's fine.
41944,josh,We write SAP's all the time. Saying what?
41946,josh,He's not going to veto Foreign Ops.
41947,josh,He's not going to threaten to veto--
41948,josh,"First of all, I don't think it will."
41950,josh,Then we look like a bunch of empty shirts.
41952,josh,"No, it is not. I am at my most effective for this country when lawmakers are under the  impression that I have influence with the President, so is Leo, and so is Toby, so is  C.J., so is the Vice President. We're not giving back Roe. We're going to swallow it on  Foreign Ops, that is all. It's a good package, and I'm celebrating tonight."
41953,josh,"The daughters of any revolution will do. Listen, I'm not going to ask for an SAP on the  resolution, but I think it's important enough that I don't mind if you go over my head  and ask Leo to call for it."
41954,josh,It's okay to tell Mrs. Bartlet you disagree with her you know.
41958,toby,"You wanted to become a scientist, but you didn't. You became a lawyer and got a job at  the council's office so let's do that now."
41960,toby,"House Resources is hearing testimony on the Polluter Pays bill. If we can get justice  to grant him immunity under the whistle blower statute, he testify tomorrow and say that  Kierney-Passaic has been hiding dangerous levels of cancer causing whatever in the EPA  reports. It will do tremendous good for us in terms of winning this one. "
41963,josh,Plus we retard Kierney-Passaic's progress in killing people.
41964,toby,Josh is right. There are several positive outcomes.
41965,josh,"Mike, can he get whistle blower status?"
41969,toby,How is testifying in front of House Resources not lawful?
41971,josh,"What do you mean he'd better get it? If he doesn't get it, he doesn't talk."
41972,josh,We have to turn him in now?
41973,josh,I don't understand. All I did was get up in the morning... then I got a message to go  see you.
41974,toby,How come he knows about the rule?
41975,josh,Everybody knows about that.
41976,toby,Was something else on your mind that moment in law school when they taught that rule?  Were you distracted by a bumblebee?
41979,toby,"Then why the hell did you come to my office and tell me... I don't care. Mike, let's get  him immunity."
41981,josh,"You going to the DAR thing tonight? It's not that I didn't know the federal law it's...  we... we got in a little deep before I was able to, you know, summon that..."
41997,josh,You don't have to make a big deal out of it. He doesn't have to know he's being tailed.
42009,c.j.,We can't politicize it.
42013,c.j.,Is Hillary Toobin ready to get publicly scolded by the White House?
42016,c.j.,You don't want to do it.
42026,toby,What are you doing here?
42027,toby,"It didn't occur to me until I asked why you didn't tell your lawyer. You knew what  you were doing the whole way, right? Get the President's muscle to lean on justice  for immunity."
42029,toby,That's quite an impressive ethical learning curve.
42030,toby," Really. The U.S. attorneys are going to grill you for a while, but you'll  get the immunity."
42047,bartlet,"No, some of us call her Marblehead."
42057,bartlet,"We don't have to ask you to screw up Abbey, you do by your..."
42059,bartlet,"I can't publicly reprimand you, it wouldn't play well. We save you for other things."
42061,bartlet,You want to hear about Max Weber?
42063,bartlet,"German thinker Max Weber said that politics is the ""slow boring of hard boards and that  anyone who seeks to do it must risk his own soul"". You know what that means?"
42065,bartlet,It means that change comes in excruciating increments for those who want it. You're  trying to move mountains. It takes lifetimes. But Zoey Bartlet is the newest Daughter  of the American Revolution so I like our chances for the long run.
42069,bartlet,Till the bulk of the bill is appropriated.
42077,bartlet,"Keep talking, I'm going to turn off the light."
42079,bartlet,"No, I have to get up early. "
42080,c.j.,"Because it's 18 hours from Manila, it's 9:25 p.m., Eastern."
42081,c.j.,We left Manila at 3:25 today.
42082,c.j.,"In Manila, it was yesterday."
42083,c.j.,"Well, no, actually, it was tomorrow, but it's 9:25 right now, Eastern. Agreed?"
42084,c.j.,"But it's not, Steve; you can just look out the window and chack that one off the list."
42085,bartlet, He's telling me the deadline for Columbia's recertification is  midnight tonight.
42086,bartlet, Didn't I sign those papers all ready?
42088,bartlet,"Just to check, they're going to tell me that the narco-trafficantes are running the  Parliament, but that we should recertify them as an ally in the drug war."
42089,bartlet,You mean calling them an enemy.
42090,bartlet,"And the deadline for that is today, right?"
42091,bartlet,"Jessie, left turn, maintain altitude?"
42092,bartlet,"Leo, hang on a second.  What's the problem on the ground?"
42096,bartlet,You'll keep me briefed?
42099,bartlet,"Well, it should cost more, don't you think?"
42101,bartlet,You got a lot more of these stories?
42103,bartlet,I've got a plane full of reporters up here.
42105,c.j.,"Good evening, Mr. President."
42106,bartlet,"Charlie, stay in here, would you? Here's what's going on. The light that indicates  that the landing gear is locked didn't go on, which usually indicates that there's  something wrong with the light. But what they're going to do is, they've sent a  fighter jet to fly up alongside and get visual confirmation that it's down, and then  we land. Here's the tricky part."
42107,c.j.,Here's the tricky part?
42108,bartlet,"The press can't know this is going on. There are two issues. One is that the Nikkei's  about to open, the other is national security. We can't broadcast that Air Force One  is up in the air over West Virginia and can't land."
42109,c.j.,The co-pilot told us it was a problem on the ground; we'll stay with that.
42111,c.j.,That's gonna take some thought.
42114,c.j.,Can you give me some tarmac jargon? What would be happening on the ground that the  plane can't land?
42118,c.j.,"Ed, Larry, can you talk to Will for a second?"
42119,c.j.,Has anyone else noticed that Chris's been on the phone for the last 20 minutes but  hasn't spoken?
42120,c.j.,"Hey, who remembers Dial-a-Joke?"
42121,c.j.,"A maintenance truck caused a fuel spill on our runway a few minutes ago, and they're  cleaning it up."
42122,c.j.,I don't know how long it's going to take.
42124,c.j.,"Signal, this is C.J. Cregg. I need you to page Leo McGarry with a call holding."
42126,josh,Stop thinking like a Republican.
42127,josh,"And that's fine, I have nothing with that; I really don't. I'm just saying stop  thinking like that."
42128,josh,"It's cleaning up Chesapeake Bay; it's not regulation, and regulation is what  Congressmen do."
42129,josh,"Well, when the Chesapeake starts turning flourescent colors, local business is gonna  have a bigger problem."
42130,josh,And that's why the President's signing it.
42131,josh,"No, it doesn't... feel too regulated; it doesn't have the texture of how do you say,  the je ne sais quios..."
42133,josh,What does Chesapeake mean?
42138,josh,There was a fuel spill on the ground at Andrews. They've to clean it up before he  can land.
42139,josh,"Yeah, I'm gonna head back to my office. Why don't you guys move on to point/nonpoint  source pollution and the storm runoff; I'll be back in a few minutes."
42140,josh,They're having a problem with their landing gear?
42142,josh,"No, you wrote they're having a problem with their landing geek."
42144,josh,"Yeah, but they're saying it's nothing though, right?"
42146,josh,"All right, do me a favor, I wanted the President to look at the Medicare rules."
42149,josh,"Yeah, they spilled something on the runway; I just got part of the story."
42153,josh,"Yeah, and you can try and get me C.J. on the phone."
42156,josh,Chesapeake Bay cleanup.
42157,josh,It's nothing. It's Chesapeake Bay cleanup.
42158,josh,It's a bipartisan bill. It's a victory for us. It's an environmental bill; the  Republicans hate it. It's incredibly regulatory.
42159,josh,"Well, I appreciate your thoughts."
42161,josh,Divided governemnt's what we got. We should go on a hunger strike?
42163,josh,"Good night, Congressmen."
42166,josh,Donna's getting C.J. on the phone.
42167,toby,I sent Will to the Philippines in my place.
42168,josh,It's not like they're not going to fix it. You don't have to feel guilty about it.
42169,toby,"No, I mean, thank God, I sent Will in my place."
42170,josh,How long before they know?
42172,toby,"Well, that's about all the time C.J.'s got to work with up there 'cause Leo, there's  a wire service guy standing at Andrews right now whose job it is to record the wheels  downtime and pretty soon he's gonna say, ""Show me the fuel spill."""
42178,toby,"Well, we knew he felt that way."
42181,josh,They called in an air raid and the computer hit them as a target. How'd you like to  have to be the guy that explains that?
42182,toby,Were Simmel and Segal giving you a hard time about the Chesapeake cleanup?
42183,josh,They're not big fans of mine.
42184,toby,"I meant 'cause of the nuisance of having to circle around up there. When I said, ""Thank  God, I sent Will instead of me,"" not 'cause of the other thing."
42187,c.j.,"Blue Ridge Mountains, what can we look at?"
42188,c.j.,Anything with lights or fireworks?
42191,c.j.,Any kind of Festival of Lights or astronomy? Is there a comet?
42192,bartlet,"Yeah, it's confirmed. Five infantrymen, they're on their way back."
42193,c.j.,Have the families been notified?
42194,bartlet,"No. I'm going to do that when I get on the ground. Will, I was supposed to get a  Columbia recertification briefing in the car. Are you in a position to do it up here?"
42196,bartlet,That statue says it's got to be in person.
42198,bartlet,That Columbia is an ally in the drug war. So what's the plan?
42199,c.j.,Ed and Larry are looking for something in the Blue Ridge Mountains.
42204,bartlet,"All right, let's get this over with and land."
42205,c.j.,"Okay, its time. It's a minute away."
42210,c.j.,"No, you have to. I screw with them all them time. They're not going to but it from me."
42212,c.j.,It's not worth a try? Look at me. Look at my face. It's not worth a try?
42221,c.j.,"Signal, this is C.J. Cregg. Shut off the phones in the press cabin. "
42222,c.j.,There's a problem with the plane's landing gear.
42226,bartlet,How close do we fly to the tower?
42228,bartlet,And we just can't stay up here for a couple of days and wait till there's a moon?
42230,bartlet,"Larry, would you go back and mention that to C.J.?"
42231,c.j.,No one up here's in a position to file right now.
42232,c.j.,That's the story you'd file? You wouldn't mention the landing gear?
42233,c.j.,"Come on. The maintenance truck was an honest effort to avoid panic. Of course, you were  going to know the truth at the end of the incident."
42234,c.j.,"I'm not going to broadcast that the President's plane is in distress. It creates very  real security concerns, and it also happens to be a world market event."
42235,c.j.,"The story's embargoed. If a cellphone appears in violation of FAA regulations, the  cell phone will be confiscated by a steward."
42240,c.j.,"Yeah, they're going to do a midair refueling with a KC-10."
42241,c.j.,It means they think we're going to be up here a little while longer.
42247,josh,About the Chesapeake cleanup.
42249,josh,He didn't storm the gate.
42250,josh,"Well, they would have preferred he had, to your opening it for him."
42251,josh,"I get the House is angry we didn't take back the House, and setting aside the fact it  was their damn fault and not ours-- stopping all bipartisan legislation is like saying,  ""Let's blow up the place. Maybe voters will hire us to rebuild it."""
42253,josh,We're finishing it now. What do you need?
42255,josh,Okay. That's about three different ways of saying a brand-new tax on local business.
42257,josh,"I'm fine with that. Fact, I'm all for it, but Tom's got to take this back to Republicans."
42259,josh,Super. What's going on up there?
42264,toby,"Congressman, I'm afraid I have some bad news. One of your constituents died today.  Gunnery Sergeant Harold Dokes from Bedford Stuyvesant. It was a friendly fire accident.  Five guys reported fire, and a computer popped their coordinates. And their bodies are  being flown here now."
42265,toby,"Your speech at the Brookings Institution tomorrow. Congressman, are you opposing  intervention in Kuhndu because so far, it's the black kids who are doing the dying?"
42266,toby,"Yeah, but the fact that this is immediate. I mean to say, the mass slaughter of tens of  thousands of Africans-- mostly young men-- which calls for..."
42268,toby,The lives we're saving in Kuhndu-- and I agree...
42269,toby,But you agree there ar moral imperatives?
42270,toby,"Mark, obviously, we need votes from the Black Caucus next week. Are you telling me it  isn't in the vested interest of Black America?"
42271,toby,And how is opposing the peacekeeping bill at Brookings going to achieve...?
42273,toby,You want to draft a million middle-class kids out of spite?
42281,josh,No one's feeling useful right now.
42283,josh,What are you doing right now?
42285,josh,How come you go out with so many Republicans?
42287,josh,"You do. Cliff, Commander Wonderful, Dr. Freeride."
42289,josh,Do you know how to lock the landing gear?
42300,toby,"Yeah, he's got a long list of kids from Bed-Stuy. The Black Caucus is going to back the  peacekeeping bill, if we back their amendment to reinstate the draft."
42304,toby,"Right, also the Vietcong."
42306,toby,What if we said we'd allow debate?
42308,bartlet,Is cocaine production in Columbia up or down?
42310,bartlet,And how many of our extradition requests have been honored?
42314,bartlet,Any good news? Anything we can hang our hat on?
42318,bartlet,What they spend it on? If you tell me coccaine...
42320,bartlet,"So, I recertify them in recognition of the fact that they took our anti-drug money  and went to Seaworld."
42322,bartlet,"All right, leave that stuff with me."
42328,c.j.,Four hours of fuel they took on. Did you even know it was up there?
42330,c.j.,It's okay. You're afraid of flying.
42332,c.j.,Why'd you sign up for the Air Force Reserve?
42334,josh,"Hey, everybody, how's it going in here?"
42335,josh,I don't know why it's taking so long to clean fuel up off a runway. It must be...  I don't know.
42337,josh,"I'm sure that's what they are going to do if, you know... Listen, uh, I want to read  over what we got now. But we're all done here, except the Causcus Chair wants to add  something we had on Superfund, which is revenue enhancements."
42342,josh,We can find more offsets. There's a way to do this.
42343,josh,"Of course we want to... Whatever Republican votes we may lose, we're going to make up  on the other side."
42345,josh,"Yes, it will. Now you got to stay here. You got to find more offsets and more ways to  bury them."
42350,josh,What are Angel Maintenance procedures?
42354,josh,"Why didn't I know that Airlift Ops calls the plane ""Angel""?"
42356,josh,"All right, well, deal with them now."
42360,josh,"Well, we don't have a problem with people's luggage tonight. You call your guys at  Airlift ops. Tell them they got to get you ready to educate the Press Secretary on  maintenance procedures as soon as Angel's on the ground."
42363,bartlet,"How many times-- seriously, Leo-- how many times has the Black Caucus on retreats,  at dinners... how many times have they...? There was a dinner two years where the  Vice Chairs literally pulled out a map of Africa. They wanted me to make Africa a  priority. And now they're making me look like a idiot."
42364,bartlet,"Well, now they want me to make Brooklyn a priority. And when did these guys become  Smoot and Hawley? Hang on a second. "
42365,bartlet," Jessie Weiskopf's coming down, and he ain't smiling."
42366,bartlet,"Okay, and how long do you think this'll take?"
42367,bartlet,An hour and 15? Where are we?
42368,bartlet,"All right, pretty soon though, we got to stop just flying around."
42369,bartlet,This is starting to qualify as space travel now.
42370,bartlet,"The Falcon couldn't get a visual read, so we're going to buzz the tower at Andrews in  a Boeing 747. Weiskopf says it's going to be an hour and 15 minutes. I'm going to call  the families from up here of the five guys."
42376,bartlet,I'm going to call the families now. They're going to send up some information. Can you  help me out?
42378,bartlet,Just give this to C.J. You should read it on the way.
42380,bartlet,Do me a favor. Find out what happens if I don't certify Columbia. Find out what happens  if I decertify Columbua.
42382,bartlet,"If I'm going to be up here, I may as well do something."
42384,bartlet,The fly-by's going to take about an hour and 15 minutes. Would you tell C.J.?
42388,c.j.,Somebody ask Steve what time it is. It's going to crack you up.
42389,c.j.,How is it a threat to anyone on the ground?
42391,c.j.,By screwing with the front wheel?
42392,c.j.,"No, your right. I should definitely let you use the phone."
42393,c.j.,We're going to do a fly-by at Andrews. This thing's almost over.
42398,toby,"Budget didn't have anything Mark wants. He can call OMB himself. Leo, let's say we study..."
42400,toby,Study some version of his amendment.
42404,toby,"It is, but it's not ridiculous. We say we're going to study the draft and..."
42406,toby,Mark knows that. He wants the debate. We want our peacekeeping appropriation.  Everybody's happy.
42408,toby,And Mark's point is who keeps the...
42410,toby,People who got nowhere else to go...
42412,toby,"The five guys on their way home right now... didn't advance very far, I think is  Mark's point."
42420,bartlet,"Right, but at the moment, I'm more concerned with our credibility. He told me at the  Summit of the Americas that he'd work toward crop diversification. Did he mean opium  and coke?"
42422,bartlet,"Yes, but he's not helping us, so why should I give him political cover? Listen, I'm  serious. What would happen if I don't recertify Columbia?"
42426,bartlet,Why?  Because the deadline was midnight...
42428,bartlet,The actual signed paper?
42430,bartlet,This is really how the world works.
42432,bartlet,I want this plane to land!
42440,josh,'Cause of the revenue enhancements?
42446,josh,Did those two idiots let the Republicans on the Committee know? They were already  pissed at him.
42448,josh,Is the President supposed to open a pizzeria while the Republicans control Congress?
42450,josh,We're going to lose an ally in Landis.
42452,josh,And they say the two parties can't get together on anything. 
42456,josh,I just needed Leo for a second.
42458,josh,The guys you're talking to-- what do they think happened?
42466,josh,As soon as Andrews waved off the plane. Would you guys mind? Could you give us the  room for a second?
42467,josh,"It's not the Democrats this time, it's the Republicans. It's not going to happen."
42468,josh,"It's not going to get out of Committee. The White House is going to have to pull its  support, but there's room in the EPA budget, room in the interior budget."
42470,josh,"So are the Republicans, Tom. You're probably going to have a primary challenge."
42472,josh,This is something that was never in my lap the right way.
42473,josh,"Well, tht's a bit of an overstatement... isn't it?"
42476,toby,He said I should come in.
42477,toby,"""The President does not think we shoud reinstate the draft nor does he intend to do so,  but he respects Chairman Richardson as a leader in the Congress, and he's eager to hear  what he has to say and to engage in thorough debate."""
42478,toby,What C.J. will say tomorrow from the podium in exchange for votes of the Black Caucus  on peacekeeping in Kuhndu.
42479,toby,"No, it'll screw us the regular amount."
42480,toby,"Actually, the money ended up coming in handier than the soldiers."
42481,toby,"You don't, Congressman. I was just on the job tonight."
42482,toby,125. It was the last six months of the draft. It went up to 90 that year... but I  didn't have the 300 bucks.
42483,toby,I'd like to stay if you don't mind.
42487,c.j.,"Signal, this is C.J. Cregg. Please turn the phones back on in the press cabin. "
42488,c.j.,We're landing. We got an indicator light. You should feel free to file. Thank you all  very much.
42494,c.j.,I was meaning to ask you. Why did you ask about the front wheel before? You asked the  Colonel if it was the front wheel.
42496,c.j.,To whack it into place?
42498,c.j.,I'm so happy I didn't have that information.
42500,c.j.,It just suddenly worked?
42504,c.j.,I'm not sure I'm good at living in a world where that kind of thing is possible.
42506,c.j.,"I imagine myself destitute, I imagine myself unlucky in love. But I never imagine my  life would be in danger with really uncommon frequency. It feels a little bit good,  doesn't it?"
42510,c.j.,At the exact moment of the equinox. At the exact moment of the equinox.
42512,c.j.,It does work. It has to be the exact moment of the equinox.
42518,c.j.,I don't think you did it at the exact moment.
42522,c.j.,That was the Autumnal equinox.
42523,josh,It only works for the Vernal equinox?
42525,josh,You know what's more likely? 
42526,c.j.,That it doesn't work at all?
42532,josh,Something that's true at the vernal equinox would also have to be true at the autumnal  equinox.
42534,josh,Equinox means equal night. Night and day are both 12 hours long.
42535,c.j.,What does that have to do with it?
42536,josh,It doesn't work. I've tried it.
42538,josh,Hang on. C.J. believes that at the exact moment of the vernal equinox...
42539,c.j.,And only at that moment.
42540,josh,You can stand an egg vertically.
42542,josh,At the equinox you can stand an egg on its end.
42543,toby,"Yeah, that doesn't work."
42545,toby,"I don't need to try it, you can't stand an egg on its end. The elements involved with  creating an equinox have no connection to the center of gravity of an egg."
42547,toby,"I've seen guys make ace of spades jump out of their shoes, I don't think it was the  equinox."
42555,josh,"I miss Ainsley. That's who the Counsel's office should get to fill that position,  another Ainsley. A sexy conservative with first-rate law credentials and a strange name."
42557,josh,Who else is playing in this game?
42559,bartlet,Why are you so eager to get in this game?
42561,bartlet,"This is a cash game, Debbie. These are hard working people blowing off some steam and  taking each other off their coin. We don't play for matchsticks and we don't play... "
42562,bartlet,"...Okay, can I ask you something? I forgot to have Charlie to draw cash for me, can you  float me a little?"
42564,bartlet,"Leo, C.J. swears that on the equinox, which is today, you can stand an egg on end."
42570,bartlet,Well that's why these are unmanned right? All we lost was money? Aren't they saying  detonate the plane?
42572,bartlet,"Well, what do they want me to do, call Chigorin and ask if we can go in and get our  spy plane back?"
42574,bartlet,"Wait, you're serious. They want me to call Chigorin?"
42576,bartlet,And ask him for the plane back without telling him we were spying?
42581,bartlet,"Yeah, this isn't going to work."
42592,josh,Nothing like the mounting tension of a well contested hand.
42593,bartlet,You were full of crap. You had jack-high or something?
42597,bartlet,"Hang on. Will, why are you dressed like an officer in the Air Force?"
42601,bartlet,I didn't know that.  Did you know that?
42602,c.j., He's First Lieutenant Will.
42603,bartlet,I had no idea. What do you do?
42605,bartlet,And this is your weekend up?
42607,bartlet,Well good for you. Where are you stationed?
42611,bartlet,Are we getting somewhere?
42613,bartlet,"And what do I do when Chigorin tells me that Hawaii's not really part of America, and  he wants to change the alphabet to Cyrillic?"
42617,bartlet,What area are we trolling in?
42621,bartlet,We were spying for him?
42623,bartlet,"Okay, this phone call you're going to set up with Chigorin...it's like for a White  House bloopers reel or something?"
42641,c.j.,"Oh my God, did you see that? Did you guys see that?!"
42642,josh,We're not going to need that three of clubs?
42644,toby,"No, I don't believe that's true."
42648,josh,"51, the three of clubs."
42656,josh, Deal me out for three hands.
42664,josh,Your sense of humor's a bit of a high wire act isn't it? You're really trying to thread  the needle.
42672,josh,Are you saying it's Hector you're saying is good looking or is it...?
42680,josh,"No, I was asking, do you like to be called Joe?"
42681,josh,Were you saying yes to that the first time?
42682,josh,"It's funny, it's what I was just saying, the person who created the job opening, her  name was Ainsley Hayes, and she was, uh, a very attractive woman, and I was saying  that we needed to find another attractive woman with an unusual name, and, here,  you're a man and your name is Joe."
42683,josh,"You've go to be asking yourself why I told you that story. Ah, you have a joint JD-MBA?"
42684,josh,What does a staff attorney do at the New York City Department of Transportation?
42685,josh,Slipping on the sidewalk?
42686,josh,Banging your head on a turnstile?
42687,josh,After a JD-MBA from Cal?
42688,josh,"Then Associate Council at Treasury, then the Solicitor General's office... Why did  you leave the Solicitor General's office?"
42689,josh,You weren't a political appointee?
42690,josh,I'm surprised we haven't met.
42692,josh,"I'll be back in a second. You forgot to sign the bottom of the questionnaire, the SF-86.  You've got to sign your name."
42696,bartlet," But President Bartlet, we have a terrific search-and-recovery team.  We'll just go get that plane for you."
42698,bartlet,"""Our folks""? You really think I'd use those words with the Russian President?"
42699,josh,"You say, ""Sir, this UAV has proprietary American technology on it made by one of our  leading aerospace companies and we have to protect that""."
42700,bartlet,"""Much as I have to protect Kaliningrad, sir, which brings us to the question of what  the hell were you doing flying over it?"""
42704,bartlet,What was the other mission?
42706,bartlet,I tell him it was an environmental mission?
42708,bartlet,"Okay, and he's not going to want to take pictures of coastal erosion at Coney Island?"
42710,bartlet,We were on an environmental mission for Finland?
42712,bartlet,That's what we've come up with?
42716,josh,Yeah.  Don't forget to sign this thing. They just have a whole...
42717,josh,"I'm sorry, ah, tell me again why you left the solicitor's office."
42718,josh,"He brought in a new staff. Um, you've already talked with Judy Wells?"
42720,josh,They made you fill out the psychological part of the questionnaire?
42721,josh,"Question 1: A] I do not feel sad, B] I feel sad, C] I am sad all the time and I can't  snap out of it, D] I am so sad or unhappy that I want to kill myself. You chose A] I  do not feel sad."
42723,josh,"No, you don't ever feel sad or..."
42724,josh,"Yet you checked the first box, why is that?"
42725,josh,Okay. This'll just take another minute or so.
42727,c.j.,I'm locking the door; there are still some press around.
42728,toby,Five dollars if you hit the sixth.
42729,c.j.,There's a spot on the earth where the temperature is exactly the same as it would be  if you drilled through the earth to the other side.
42731,c.j.,"Yes, there is, and it's called the antipode. And if that's true, then why can't it be  that you could stand an egg on end at the equinox?"
42733,c.j.,And I say that neither of you can hit the fifth row.
42744,toby,Is the President in the Oval Office?
42746,bartlet,"Let's go.  Mr. President, this is President Bartlet."
42748,bartlet,"Okay, you know what, I'm going to have to call you back."
42749,bartlet," Bamboo, they want me to get into the motorcade."
42753,bartlet,I was on the phone with Chigorin. 
42754,bartlet,He's got code word clearance. 
42755,bartlet,Was anyone in the room? 
42763,bartlet," Will, how many fingers am I holding up?"
42765,bartlet,"I don't know if you've met Ron Butterfield, the head of my detail."
42771,bartlet,"But if he's heard what happened, he's going to be trying to get here..."
42772,bartlet,"No, I'm telling you that if Charlie heard there were bullets, he's going to overpower  whoever's trying to..."
42774,bartlet,"It's bulletproof glass in the windows, okay. You want to kill me, you're going to have  to do it from inside the building."
42775,bartlet,"I'm surprised your guys managed to keep Fiderer in her chair. I would have thought she'd  be the first one through the d... No, here we are."
42776,bartlet,"No one was hurt, someone shot at the press briefing room from the sidewalk."
42777,bartlet,"Will's sitting right outside, and Toby and C.J. are standing right there. "
42780,bartlet,"This was just a crazy guy, Leo."
42784,c.j.,"All right, then here it is. ""An indeterminate number of shots were fired at the White  House at..."" I said I thought it was three shots but I want for the agents to...Okay,  ""At 9:23 pm, striking the Press Briefing Room""..."
42785,c.j.,We haven't confirmed any ballistics. Tell your friends to stop saying it was an M-16.
42786,c.j.,All right. The President was in the Oval Office. We've initiated a standard lockdown  procedure and are back to conducting the business of the nation... I'll ask him.  He wants to know if the President wants to say something funny.
42787,c.j.,"Something funnier than that, but yeah."
42788,josh,You're getting to see a show tonight.
42790,josh,A guy shot at the building a couple of times with a rifle.
42792,josh,The street. Pennsylvania Avenue.
42794,josh,"No, but we're in a crash. A lockdown. They're not going to let you leave the West Wing."
42795,josh,"No, but I heard a brass quintet playing ""The First Noel,"" so I just assumed somebody  somewhere was locked and loaded."
42796,josh," Uh, they told me you're just here tonight. Do you  have to catch a plane?"
42797,josh,"Well, we don't know what this is yet."
42798,josh,"Yeah. Yeah. No, that's the first time it's happened to us anyway."
42801,josh,"Well, he was shooting a modified M-16. It was terrorism."
42802,josh, He shot at the White House.
42803,josh,"I have no earthly idea why he shot at us, nor for that matter do I have any reason to  believe it was a he. "
42804,josh,"That's my assistant, Donna. "
42817,josh,I don't know. I haven't been talking to him that long.
42819,josh,"He-he's well qualified, that's for sure... He's personable, and he's confident..."
42821,josh,It's the strangest feeling. It's like a... really good baseball player is standing  in the other teams locker room for the first time.
42823,josh,He's the baseball player.
42827,josh,You asked me what I thought of him so far.
42829,josh,I'm fine. I was in here. I didn't even see it.
42831,josh,"I'm sorry, what were we talking about?"
42832,josh,"Right.  I got a letter today that said, uh... ""You're a lying liar.  You lie almost as well as Bartlet."" You know, black-white, rich-poor, north-south,  odd-even. There may not be anything anymore that outpaces the hatred the right feels  for the left or the tonnage of disrespect the left feels for the right. Donna got a  letter yesterday that said, ""I'm collecting all the guns you've banned, and there's a  bullet with your name on it in each one."" Donna. The guy's decided to focus his wrath  on Donna. He's never met Donna or spoken to her, and he's never met anyone who's met  Donna or spoken to her. How's it possible? How's it possible that he hates her so much?  How can you not like Donna? She's from Wisconsin! Anyway, 20,000 specific threats made  against U.S. targets every year, and with all that, it's still the ones who don't give  you advance notice that you're worried about. "
42833,josh,A bombing in Malaysia and another one in Berlin a few hours ago.
42834,josh,Might as well use this time for the interview.
42835,c.j.,You can stand the egg on the equinox because that's when the sun's gravity is lined up  directly with the earth's.
42836,toby," Draw a line from the center of the earth to  the sun, and at anytime, someplace on earth is on that line.."
42838,toby,"C.J., try it. Take an egg, it doesn't work."
42839,c.j.,That's 'cause it's not...
42842,c.j.,I don't know... midnight?
42844,c.j.,"All right, maybe it's not at the exact moment of the equinox. Maybe it's at some point  during the equinox and you just have to keep trying, but I've seen it."
42849,c.j.,Did you know that a day on the moon and a year on the moon are the same thing?
42851,c.j.,"I thought my reflexes before, in the Press Room, were cat-like."
42852,bartlet,You guys playing again?
42853,josh,"Yeah, the game's started up."
42854,bartlet,"President Chigorin, it's Jed Bartlet again. I'm sorry about being abrupt before, but I  bet if you turn on CNN international right now you'll see..."
42855,bartlet,"Yeah, there you go. It's not a big deal, but they shut us down for a little bit."
42856,bartlet,By the way when they crash the building they don't crash all of it. The Situation Room  still works.
42857,bartlet,"Mr. President, a little while ago an unmanned B-UAV drone crashed, we think somewhere  inside Kaliningrad, as a matter of fact. Apparently they don't respond, you know, quite  the way you'd like when there's a sudden shift in the weather."
42858,bartlet,"Well, like I say, it was a UAV, it was taking satellite pictures of coastal erosion in  the Baltic Sea. The Finns know about this. We'd like to send a special operations team  ten kilometres west of Borsakova to retrieve it."
42860,bartlet,Are you getting that translation right?
42861,bartlet,"You campaigned on the environment, Mr. President. Coastal erosion in the Baltic Sea. "
42862,bartlet,"Well, the problem is our UAV's have a self-detonating capability and our people know  how to disarm it, and I wouldn't want to put your guys at risk."
42863,bartlet,"It's proprietary technology, Peter."
42866,bartlet,This isn't working anymore.
42867,c.j.,"Just the dealer. Four, no help. Six, possible straight. Heart, possible flush. Jack, no  help. And the Dave of Love for a pair of tens. Tens bet."
42870,c.j.,"That's 'cause I've got faith there, mi compadre. "
42872,c.j.,The substance of things hoped for and the evidence of things not seen.
42873,toby,"Yeah, but I think what he's asking... Bump ten... I think what he's asking is why most  other nights do you think the world's going to hell in a hula hoop, but tonight...?"
42874,c.j.,We dipped twice and eat gefilte fish?
42875,toby,"Suzy Cream Cheese, do not attempt the hagaddah."
42876,c.j.,I know how to bless the soup too. I'll raise your raise.
42880,toby,The people in this room?
42881,c.j.,"And many, many, many others."
42891,toby,What the hell happened?
42895,toby,Why do we think at this point that North Korea is attacking the East Coast of the  United States?
42903,toby,"Fifty Minutemen they're arming, and is anyone saying this doesn't make sense?"
42905,toby,And they're sending in a team of lawyers to look into it.
42907,toby," A meteor fell from the sky the result being two guys are going to get court- marshalled. The only two guys who apparently thought it was strange that North Korea  would attack submarines in Connecticut instead of say, San Diego or Hawaii. And if it  had been a real attack? Would they still have been doing point/counterpoint with NORAD? "
42908,toby,We failed both on a mechanical and human level. So tell me again what you have faith in.
42911,c.j.,"Because with what little free time he has, Will is going to Wyoming to defend one of  these guys and I don't think it is failing on a human level."
42912,toby, I've got ace high flush. Give me your money.
42913,c.j.,I've got tens full of queens. Give me yours. 
42916,bartlet,"I understand. I meant...  I wasn't referring to the change in weather, sir."
42923,bartlet,We were taking pictures of Kaliningrad.
42924,bartlet,"We were taking pictures of Kaliningrad. We take pictures of black market nuclear materials  being moved out the back doors of suppositories and into trucks. The materials are being  sold to non-governmental elements and, well, that's what we were doing. Rogue engineers,  military scientists, and ex-KGB. It's just as big of a problem for you as it is for us,  but you're not dealing with it, so we were taking pictures of Kaliningrad. We're going to  have to trust each other a little Peter. So we're going to share the pictures we got. Not  the technology we used to get them. Otherwise I'm detonating it and neither of us see the  pictures. We're going to have to trust each other. Our two countries have stopped the world  from annihilating itself for 60 years because of conversations like this one. Why don't you  talk it over?"
42926,bartlet,"If he calls back we'll have a deal. In the mean time, one hand. Bring your wallet."
42929,josh,Did you just come by to look at him?
42933,josh,I told you I wasn't going to call him.
42935,josh,"I didn't... I'm telling you, there's something. A guy this qualified, I'd know who he was.  Something's wrong.  I just figured out what. Come in and say hi."
42936,josh,You've already met Donna.
42938,josh,"It has. We've talked about his name, and New York City Department of Transportation.  Then we talked about inner cities and jobs and minimum wage and public schools and  foreign aid, hitting all the Democrat g-spots. And it wasn't until now that I realized  that there was something I forgot to ask you. Are you a registered Democrat?"
42939,josh,A registered Independent?
42946,josh,"'Cause if you're a Republican, then you damned well better look like Ainsley Hayes."
42948,josh,You don't want to get a job with your own party?
42951,josh,"Oh, no, that's the kind of thing that's got to wind you up in GOP jail for the same  amount of time as..."
42952,josh,Right. Why do you want to work here? Why not the private sector?
42953,josh,You have something lined up?
42954,josh,That's my father's firm. He was a partner there.
42955,josh,They're going to offer you $225 000 a year. Is this your fallback?
42956,josh,Why do you want to work here?
42957,josh,Why haven't you signed the questionnaire?
42963,josh,You really want to work with us.
42964,josh,You know we got shot at tonight. On a Friday.
42965,josh,All right. I'm recommending you to Leo.
42966,c.j.,Last card for the players.
42967,bartlet,"Hurry it up. They're going to call us back in a second. Debbie, do something."
42969,bartlet,Thank you. Is the pastrami from Krupins?
42977,c.j.,What sites did they send you to?
42981,c.j.,"""This has to be one of the silliest misconceptions around and it never seems to die."" "
42983,c.j.,There are no web sites supporting it?
42985,toby,"And you've got to ask yourself, if no one on the internet wants a piece of this, just  how far from the pack have you strayed?"
42986,c.j., I could have sworn I saw it.
42988,toby,What's the deal with the guy?
42989,toby, He's not connected to anything?
42993,c.j.,In just a minute.  I'm going to let them know outside  that they lifted the crash. 
42994,toby,See you in the morning.
42996,bartlet,"Uh, it turns out it has to go to the Secretary of State. There's a law: It's 3-USC-20.  It goes to the Secretary of State. But we'll take care of it."
42997,bartlet,Why did you take a cab?
42999,bartlet,You know what's in here? 
43002,c.j.,"Hang on-- before we do anything, happy birthday, Mark. And don't ever say I don't pay  attention to these things."
43003,c.j.,"All right, go ahead and say it, then. What do I care?"
43004,c.j.,"You're talking about Medicare? I don't think he's seen it yet, but I'll find out."
43005,c.j.,He's going to do what he's got to do.
43006,c.j.,"He's going to do what he's got to do, Phil."
43007,c.j.,"I don't know. I know he wants to, but it's still pretty early in the week. I'm going  to go into the office."
43008,c.j.,"Wait, Katie, I'm sorry. You were asking something at the beginning, and I cut you off  to wish Mark a happy birthday. You know, just in case, why don't you come with me--  the rest, I'll see you at 11:00."
43009,c.j.,Hi. We've never met. It's my pleasure.
43010,c.j.,Why is science coming to the White House?
43012,c.j.,Only to the extent that I'm aware that it exists. But I can take your question to the  President's science advisor.
43014,c.j.,"I called you back for a single in front of everybody. That costs me. Your question is:  ""Is there life on Mars?"" And ""Is the White House hiding that there's life on Mars?""  And what the hell does this have to do with the Vice President?!"
43017,c.j.,"You've got to ask Gish what kind of credible source goes to the science editor with a  story, instead of--"
43018,c.j., I can't imagine that it's true.
43019,c.j.,"Um, I don't know. But I'll find out to the first bunch of questions and, as for ""legal""  and ""not legal,"" that's a matter for the Counsel's Office. Oh, hey, yeah, that's a  matter for the Counsel's Office. I know the right guy to speak to down there. He's  going to fix you right up."
43020,c.j.,"Excuse me. That's a great outfit, Blair."
43021,c.j.,"Yes, he's a Republican, too, Mr. Quincy is."
43022,c.j.,"This is a cool office, Joe."
43023,c.j.,"Got a little window up there near the ceiling that looks out onto the, uh... the...  What do you call it? The..."
43024,c.j.,"Yeah. And, you know, if you hang 'em on that pipe in the corner, late afternoon, you  get your suits pressed right in front of you."
43025,c.j.,"Hey, no, but that's a good idea. Let me show you around."
43026,c.j.,"Joe, I outrank you by, like, 17 rungs, so follow me, would you?"
43027,c.j.,"Come on. It's going to be fun. But if it's not, you should pretend that it is anyway.  You know why?"
43028,c.j.,"Hey, no, but then again, I like how you're thinking."
43029,c.j.,"So, do you know what I'm going to get asked about probably at my first briefing today?  The Department of Agriculture report that'll come out this morning saying that  commodity prices are down six percent this year, and do I suppose the White House  is going to respond to the farmers who are going broke? And I thought, since the  Republicans tore up the farm safety net, you might have a good idea for what I  should say."
43030,c.j.,You're saying it's good that farmers can't sell what they grow for a living wage?
43031,c.j.,"It's good, except, whoa! Those pesky farmers again. Don't worry about it though, 'cause  it's not like there are that many of them. No, wait, I misspoke. Agriculture is this  country's biggest industry."
43032,c.j.,"That was the staircase, okay? What do you want? It was the Dolly Madison staircase."
43034,c.j.,"Well, this may sound silly, but the science editor from the Washington Post has a  source-- a blind source-- who says that the Vice President personally told him--  the blind source-- that the Vice President interfered to classify a report that a  NASA commision, which he heads, has saying that there's life on Mars. "
43035,c.j.,"Would you find out who broke the law, please?"
43036,c.j.,The farmers are victims of this Republican Congress.
43037,c.j.,"Well argued, though I do hate you and everything you stand for."
43038,c.j.,"I'm the press secretary, Boo-boo. I don't have that kind of time."
43040,c.j.,"You speak to the Vice President, Joe. You're his lawyer."
43044,toby,"Well, that family isn't gonna get up the hill 'cause dad's trying to pull the kids, the  camping gear, Rex the dog and what would appear to be his den up K-2 in a Ford Falcon."
43048,toby,You thought that ad was powerful?
43050,toby,Yeah! If I'm watching that ad...
43052,toby,That was for soccer moms?
43056,toby,"Soccer moms recognize a Big 3 hosing when it walks up and introduces itself good as  anyone, and they know it often begins with ""Tell your Congressman America's about  freedom."" And that mom was worried 'cause dad's hauling a yardsale up Kilimanjaro.  And she's thinking, ""Wow, I married an idiot."""
43058,toby,You think it's gonna be effective?
43060,toby,How did the Hollywood types get into this equation?
43062,toby,You think we should run a counter ad.
43068,toby,We've been sitting here for 20 minutes.
43070,toby,"Well, get one. Have an idea. Don't come in here with half a thing and not be able to--  you know, after you've walked me to the brink and say, ""We've got to do this, it's  important, though I have no earthly idea how."" Like one of those guys who buys a big  new thing but doesn't really know how to get the most out of it!"
43083,josh,What the hell are you doing?
43085,josh,"Well, let me get rid of it."
43089,josh,I'm gonna scare him away.
43093,josh,I'm not going to hurt him. I'm just...
43095,josh,"In a second he's going to be bothering me, right?"
43104,josh,Justice didn't call off the investigation. They reached a settlement with Casseon.
43106,josh,"You can work with C.J.'s office to run down the source, I guess, and see what's going on."
43108,josh,Hey.  How's it going so far?
43109,josh,At the beginning I'm going to ask you to give me a quick hit just so you can learn how  to keep the crazy stuff out of his office.
43111,josh,"This is two in one day. I just got ""Did the White House interfere with Casseon  anti-trust?""  and sure."
43113,josh,Wait. What did they say we got in exchange for calling off the D.O.J.?
43115,josh,They said that? You weren't just making a joke?
43117,josh,They said that to... Carol said the reporter said that?
43119,josh,"Well, now we go see Leo."
43125,josh,"I don't practice law? I help write the laws, I write the laws, I make the laws,  I am the law."
43127,josh,"Margaret, this is Joe Quincy."
43130,josh," Okay, Donna just got a question from the  Post... ""Did we..."" I'm sorry, by the way, have you met..."
43132,josh," All right, you go first."
43137,josh,Did we get the Justice Department to call off it's anti-trust investigation with Casseon?
43139,josh,"I know, but ask Donna what they bribed us with. Tell him what the Post said we got in  exchange for calling off Justice."
43143,josh,"There's a leak. This, Mars, the people... don't even get me started on that 'cause the  stuff I think you still won't tell me. Who knew about the terms with Casseon outside us...  and now them?"
43167,toby,"You said I wouldn't even know you were here. Just so you know, I can tell that you are."
43171,toby,"I don't know what kind of salad it is. I'm eating a salad, okay? I'm doing it. Do I have  to know the names? There's no difference between them. It's a bowl of weeds. Some of them  have cheese. This isn't the kind with cheese. Does that answer your question? How many  years have you guys been ""Toby, you eat like a teenager. Toby, that's red meat. That's  your second cigar."" Here I am eating a salad, which by the way, you could cover this  thing in barbecue sauce and it would still tastes like the ground, and I'm getting  heckled from the gallery, who wanted to come in here to eat his roast beef sandwich with  ketchup on a kaiser roll and watch the damn tennis on my TV! That's all I'm saying."
43172,toby,"Yes, I'm doing everything I can.  What?"
43173,toby,Yeah. You're the new sawbones.
43174,toby,Damn it. This is Charlie Young.
43175,toby,"Yeah. If Counsel's fine, you just have C.J. Cregg's office put it out."
43176,toby,Did I beat up on them in the notes for the press comments?
43179,toby,"Joe, did you think I was going to have the Press Secretary, on behalf of the President,  compare a Federal judge to a pistachio nut? The language gets cleaned up on C.J.'s desk."
43180,toby,"You know when you do ten minutes on Helen Baldwin getting a book deal, it's righteous,  but I speak my mind after getting poked with a stick and it's 'cause of Andy!"
43181,toby,"Yeah. You just go that way and then, you know, ask somebody else."
43185,c.j.,"You know what happens with negotiated press leaks? Two-thirds of the press gives us  lousy coverage 'cause they're tweaked that they didn't get the leak, and the other  third... "
43186,c.j.,...doesn't give us better coverage 'cause they... 
43189,c.j.,"They think they see the reflection in the window, and they think it's another bird."
43192,c.j.,"Sorry, we thought for a second you were a huge bird knocking on the door."
43193,c.j.,"Well, one of them is obsessed with Donna."
43197,c.j.,I wouldn't worry to much about Mars. I gave it to you to give you a hard time.
43200,c.j.,How would a gossip columnist get a hold of a story about the Pentagon?
43203,c.j.,Stu Winkles don't get tips about the White House illegally suppresing reports.
43204,c.j.,You want me to call Stu Winkle?
43205,c.j.,I don't usually make personal calls to gossip columnist.
43206,c.j.,And you won't tell me why?
43207,c.j.,Even if I give you assurances that I already hold you in contempt?
43209,c.j.,Would you get me Stu Winkle at the Washington Post?
43210,c.j.,Stu Winkle at the Post.
43213,c.j.,Judicial imagination of pistachio nuts. Can't say that to the Fourth Circuit.
43214,c.j.,"Stu, this is C.J. Cregg at the White House. "
43216,c.j.,"It is, and I saw you have a new column and I think it's terrific and everyone here at  the White House wishes you a lot of luck."
43219,c.j.,"Well, I'm a girl on a budget."
43221,c.j.,"Stu, I wanted to get you a direct answer to that NASA Commision question that Ralph Gish  and Katie brought me this morning. It was the Defense Department and not the White House  who classified the report. "
43223,c.j.,"Stu, thank you very much. I'm sorry, I have to go."
43225,c.j.,"I need to see Josh and Toby, and Joe needs to see the Vice President."
43226,josh,"Good evening, Mr. Vice President."
43228,josh,"Mr. Vice President, have you been having an affair with Helen Baldwin while here at  the White House?"
43231,c.j.,"Thank you, Mr. Vice Presidnet."
43232,toby,"Thank you, Mr. Vice President."
43234,josh, I hope I didn't see you smile in there.
43245,toby,"Doesn't really have the feel of high-minded debate, does it?"
43249,toby,"But we're not in the trenches. Two bodies of government are debating fuel efficiency at  the highest level. We're not in the trenches. I don't know. I know it's a 15-second spot.  We got to scare them. I just don't feel like doing that tonight. Will, you need to come  with me. I need to tell you what's about to happen."
43250,bartlet,You've talked to Suzanne?
43251,bartlet,You've talked to Suzanne?
43262,bartlet,"If we're going to do this, we got to start tonight, now, and I need you thinking now  and not giving up..."
43263,bartlet,"What about ""It's none of your business?"""
43266,bartlet,"Apologize and move on. Accept responsibilty. You don't need to disclose details. She's  going to take care of that for you. You're going to be the dinner special for two months,  and then you've got two and half years to get the nomination."
43267,bartlet,"In the middle of MS, it looked like we were never going to recover, and we did."
43269,bartlet,"Well, I'm sorry, Mr. Vice President, if my multiple sclerosis was a bummer for your  sex life. How the hell did you do this to us?! You can't resign, John. It's a terrible  signal to send."
43270,bartlet,"Is there more? Is there another shoe, 'cause if it's a series of..."
43274,bartlet,Didn't you have any sense that this was the kind of person who would do this?
43275,bartlet,"Well, I want you to sleep on it. I want all of us to sleep on it."
43276,bartlet,Why did you take a cab?
43278,bartlet,You know what's in here? 
43281,bartlet," Yeah, we're going to need a new Vice President."
43282,josh,For Vice President you mean?
43284,josh,"Yeah. I'm a fan of Lyndell, so is the President, but the Speaker's not, and this guy  has to get confirmed."
43285,josh,He's got an Asian garden in the back of his house where he meditates.
43286,josh,Both of which one would find in an Asian garden.
43287,josh,You buried the champagne at the Arboretum?
43288,josh,How do you get away with digging up the National Arboretum?
43289,josh,"Well, today is the... Today's 5/7. "
43290,josh,You got to get the bottle back.
43292,josh,"You shoud dig it up, it's a good idea."
43293,josh,"No, I mean, as a friend. You give it to her as a graduation present. You give it to her  at one of the parties tonight. That way she goes off without thinking you're mad at her."
43294,josh,"Yeah, but it's not really her fault, and she's going away for a while. And... anyway, I  don't know what I'm talking about. Let me ask you something. Just between you and me...  and... I'm not looking for this particular promotion, but... just between you and me...  what would you think about this choice?"
43296,bartlet,How were they able to rent a van?
43297,bartlet," ""A torrential downpour in the Pacific Northwest."""
43298,bartlet,"""A torrential downpour."""
43299,bartlet,And they're just missing?
43300,bartlet,"The five of them, they're just missing?"
43301,bartlet,We're going to work on that?
43302,bartlet,Threat Con Bravo. Find them. Threat Con Bravo. Leo and I will be back.
43311,toby,How do you know about this?
43314,c.j.,Not because you told me.
43320,toby,It's not going to be about commencement.
43322,toby,'Cause he's not going to call the four of us in Saturday morning at 8:00 to work on a  commencement speech.
43324,toby,I'm choosing to be nervous about other things today.
43326,toby,Is he taking about the house?
43328,toby, They know about the house!
43331,josh,"It's a bold, romantic gesture. I spread it around, got you some good will. I think I  turned some people around on you."
43335,toby,"In ten days, we can pick a day on the calendar and they'll induce."
43342,bartlet,"Yeah, listen, I don't think this is going to come as a galloping shock to anyone here,  but last May I ordered a Special Ops unit to kill Abdul Shareef, and that's what they  did, and we we made it look like what got reported."
43349,bartlet,"See, I said we took Shareef, and they said fine, and then you went on talking for  another five, ten minutes."
43352,c.j.,Why the decision to tell us this morning?
43353,bartlet,"Well, I just ordered Threat Con Bravo, so people are going to be seeing some heightened  security this weekend."
43360,josh,And we're worried about retribution for Shareef?
43362,josh,"Can I ask, how hard can it be to keep an eye on five Qumari religious fanatics in  Schenectady?"
43367,c.j.,"Thank you, Mr. President."
43369,bartlet,"Oh, hey, Toby, big day."
43370,bartlet,"The house, a masterstroke. Come on, give us a kiss."
43381,bartlet,"Well, it's been said that I have a pleasant speaking voice and oratorical style."
43389,bartlet,"Yeah, right away I would think."
43391,bartlet,"Except at this minute, I have to go over and meet the agents who are beening detailed  to Zoey for France. They speak French. As well as being secret service agents. I didn't  mean they speak French and so therefore are guarding Zoey in France."
43393,bartlet,"I have been thinking that I'd like to talk about creativity. Why don't you get started  on some thoughts, and I'll join you."
43398,josh,"It's a bit of a powder-puff detail there, isn't it, fella?"
43399,josh,"So, in your training, what were you taught to do if, say a stringer for Town and Country  were to get in her face?"
43402,bartlet,Are you friends of Zoey's?
43404,bartlet,"Wes, thanks so much for doing this. I know it's not what you like."
43405,bartlet,"So, let's talk about how this is going to work."
43406,bartlet,"Well, here's my question. These guys look pretty young to me, and I'm looking for  something very specific with this detail. This is a father-daughter situation, and  so what I think I'm looking for in terms of protection would best be categorized as,  well, overwhelming force. Do they have that? Do they have the ability to just overwhelm  any danger that might...? Do you have overwh...? Do they have overwhelming force?"
43408,bartlet,This one here tossed Wesley like a bag of potato chips.
43409,bartlet,You guys know each other?
43410,bartlet,"Oh, good. Okay. Well, Ellie's still up and running."
43412,bartlet, Are you going back to the campus?
43413,bartlet,"Okay, well, let me ask you this. Would you consider instead of living in France with  your boyfriend for three months, staying here, living in your room, being a candy  striper, or surfer?"
43414,bartlet,"Or surfing? You could spend the summer working in a pet shop. We could play Yahtzee,  and watch movies at night."
43415,bartlet,What daughters would do their whole lives if I had my way.
43416,bartlet," Before I forget, if something comes up and you're faced with the choice  of killing the boyfriend or not killing the boyfriend -- kill the boyfriend."
43421,bartlet,What are we doing on the ground?
43422,bartlet,How long have they been at it?
43423,bartlet,"All right, let's give them another hour. Then have the Coast Gurad close the port.  Is it the port of Portland? Is it really the port of Portland?"
43425,bartlet,They're going to lose $700 million a day 'cause these five guys are missing. And I  just now got why we're having this meeting.
43427,bartlet,Portland. Torrential rain in the Pacific Northwest.
43429,bartlet,Screw the hour. Let's close it down.
43432,bartlet,"Well, it's about the last thing they're going to get to decide. So you choose Tuesday.  20 years later, look what happens."
43434,c.j.,What are you doing in here?
43438,c.j.,"Danny, you want to go home for a while and then talk to me?"
43440,c.j.,We'll comment as soon as you show me the link.
43441,c.j.,You've been saying that from the beginning.
43442,c.j.,We'll show it to me and I'll comment on it.
43443,c.j.,"Well, you are not going to run it like this. There are national security issues involved."
43445,c.j.,Classified security information? I don't think I'm allowed to do that.
43446,c.j.,Don't run it. Not this weekend. I'm not lying to you about security concerns.
43448,c.j.,I extend you courtesy all the time.
43449,c.j.,You just slept on my couch.
43450,c.j.,"All right, you'll give me a couple of hours."
43451,toby,All right. Careful stepping out.  There's a street right  there. And there you go.
43452,toby,"Well... I hadn't actually factored that into the plan, but if you'll just come over here.   And... there you go. Go ahead."
43454,toby,Everytime we drive past you say that it's your dream house.
43455,toby,"And every time the Congressman's had us over, you've said it was your dream house."
43456,toby,"You told Jeff Wyler that if he ever put it on he market, you wanted to buy it."
43457,toby,"Well, as it turns out, he was going to put it on the market, but he's not anymore  'cause I bought it."
43460,toby,"Well, I put together some money for the down payment by selling my soul."
43461,toby,"Well, as a matter of fact, it'll... "
43462,toby,...it'll be your house if... if... if you say yes to this.
43463,toby,Um... will you marry me?
43465,toby,If we could just get back to the original question.
43467,toby,I don't think you've noticed the things I've done to alter the behavior that's troubled  you in the past. Giving up what you felt was a bachelor apartment is only the most recent  of gestures which included eating salads.
43468,toby,Then why aren't you remarrying me?
43469,toby,"Yeah, I do. I thought you were just being cute. I just thought you were making me  chase you as a punishment for the first marriage, and that was okay with me."
43473,toby,I'm not sad. I take things seriously.
43474,toby,I'm not comparing myself to anyone. I'm saying...
43475,toby,"Well... My father used to kill people for a living, so, generationally, the Zieglers  are making lots of progress. I wouldn't worry about the kids."
43477,toby,Wouldn't it be ironic if our kids were the only ones who were properly prepared?
43478,toby,"Great! Half full, half empty? Can we at least agree it's not full yet?"
43480,toby,Did you feel this way when we were married?
43481,toby,"I mean, it's not just now?"
