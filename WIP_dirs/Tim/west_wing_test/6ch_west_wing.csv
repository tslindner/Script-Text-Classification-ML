0,sam,I know.
1,sam," You’re not going to come close to getting a quote, either."
2,sam, You sat down.
3,sam,No.
4,sam,No.
5,sam,He is.
6,sam,"Billy, I’m not talking about this."
7,sam,No one.
8,sam,"Well, you could call 1-800-BITE-ME."
9,sam,"He’s not going anywhere, Billy. It’s a non-story."
10,sam,"That hurts, Billy. Why would I lie to a journalist of all people?"
11,sam,Why?
12,sam,‘Cause Alger Hiss just walked in with my secret pumpkin.
13,sam,There’s a woman over there. I think she’s looking at me.
14,sam,I don’t know. I never know if they’re looking or not.
15,sam,I want to thank you for the casual way that you did that just now. She probably  didn’t notice that.
16,leo,I will call them.
17,leo,I’m in the shower.
18,leo, Yeah.
19,c.j.,What?
20,josh,Yeah. This is Josh Lyman. What’s going on?
21,toby,"You know when you guys say that, it sounds ridiculous to most people, right?"
22,toby,We’re flying in a Lockheed eagle series L-1011. It came off the line 20 months ago  and carries a Sim-5 Transponder tracking system. Are you telling me I can still  flummox this thing with something I bought at Radio Shack?
23,toby," Also, I never got my peanuts."
24,sam, You could run hydraulics in here.
25,sam,I’m fine.
26,sam,And probably free of cataracts.
27,sam,Thank you.
28,sam," Um, Laurie, I to have to go."
29,sam,I know this doesn’t look good.
30,sam,"You know what? I really like you. And if you give me your number, I’d like to call you."
31,sam,"It’s not that I don’t see the logic in that, but I really gotta go."
32,sam,Yup.
33,sam,"I would, but he’s not my friend, he’s my boss; and it’s not his name, it’s his title."
34,sam,President of the United States. I’ll call you.
35,leo,"We’ll take care of that in a hurry. Won’t we, Mike?"
36,leo,"Oh, why the hell not, Bonnie?"
37,leo,"Please.  Hey, Emma."
38,leo,Wilson.
39,leo,Joe.
40,leo,Whatever. 
41,leo, Josh!
42,leo,"Hey, Donna. Is he in yet?"
44,leo,Can you get him?
46,leo,Thanks.
48,leo,You heard wrong.
50,leo,It’s a mild sprain. He’ll be back later today.
52,leo,"What are you, from State Farm? Go. Do a job, would ya?"
54,leo,He was swerving to avoid a tree.
56,leo,He was unsuccessful.
57,josh, Hey.
58,leo,"How many Cubans, exactly, have crammed themselves into these fishing boats?"
59,josh,"It’s important to understand, Leo, that by and large, these aren’t fishing boats.  You hear fishing boats, you conjure an image of -- well, of a boat, first of all.  What the Cubans are on would charitably be described as rafts. Okay? They’re making  the hop from Havana to Miami in fruit baskets, basically. Let’s just be clear on that."
60,leo,We are.
61,josh,"Donna’s desk, if it could float, would look good to them right now."
62,leo,I get it. How many are there?
63,josh,We don’t know.
64,leo,"What time, exactly, did they leave?"
65,josh,We don’t know.
66,leo,Do we know when they get here?
67,josh,No.
68,leo,"True or False: If I were to stand on high ground in Key West with a good pair of  binoculars, I would be as informed as I am right now."
69,josh,That’s true.
70,leo,"The intelligence budget’s money well spent, isn’t it?"
71,josh,"Tell them to send the Coast Guard, Leo."
72,leo,The Coast Guard won’t...
73,josh,"I understand! But, they’re never going to make it to our territorial waters."
74,leo,Thank you.
75,josh,What if the D.A. suspected they had drugs?
76,leo,Does the D.A. suspect they have drugs?
77,josh,We could make a phone call.
78,leo,Josh!
79,josh,"If the D.A. or Navy Intel thought the Cubans were bringing in drugs, wouldn’t we  have to go out there and search those rafts with, you know, guns and blankets?"
80,leo,"You look like hell. You know that, don’t you?"
81,josh,"Yes. I do. Listen, Leo. Did he say anything?"
82,leo,"Did he say anything?! The President’s pissed as hell at you, Josh. And so am I."
83,josh, I know.
84,leo,You gotta work with these people. And where the hell do you get off strutting your...
85,josh,I know.
86,leo,Al Caldwell is a good man. 
87,josh,Al Caldwell wasn’t there.
88,leo,"I’m saying, you take everyone on the Christian Right, dump them into one big pile,  and label them ‘stupid’. We need these people."
89,josh,We do not need these people.
90,leo,Josh.
91,josh,We need Al Caldwell. We want Al Caldwell. We do not need John Van Dyke. And we do  not need Mary Marsh.
92,leo,"And I think there shouldn’t be instant replay in football, but that’ s not my call,  now, is it?"
93,josh, It was stupid.
94,leo,Damn straight.
95,josh,"I was right, though."
96,leo, Like I don’t know that.
97,leo,Yup.
98,leo,"A $4,000 Lynex Titanium touring bike that I swore I’d never lend anyone."
99,leo,"He’s a klutz, Mrs. Landingham. Your President’s a geek."
100,leo,I apologize.
101,leo,"Yes.  Oh, Bonnie. Call O.E.O.B. and  set up a briefing for the Vice President. Let’s coordinate with Katie Simon’s office  on the appointments."
102,leo,"Yeah!  Margaret. Please call the editor of the New York  Times crossword and tell him that ‘Khaddafi’ is spelled with an h, and two d’s, and  isn’t a seven letter word for anything."
103,leo,"Apparently, it’s neither."
104,c.j.,"Is there anything I can say, other than the President rode his bicycle into a tree?"
105,leo,He hopes never to do it again.
106,c.j.,Seriously. They’re laughing pretty hard.
107,leo,"He rode his bicycle into a tree, C.J.. What do you want me to -- “The President,  while riding a bicycle on his vacation in Jackson Hole, came to a sudden arboreal  stop” -- What do you want from me?"
108,c.j.,"A little love, Leo."
109,leo, What do you know about the Cubans?
110,sam,I don’t know anymore than Josh. Somewhere between 1200 and 2000 Cubans began  embarking from a fishing village 30 miles South of Havana.
111,josh,Vegas.
112,sam,"Miami. Though, it’s not clear how sophisticated their navigation equipment is."
113,josh,"Navigational equipment? That way is North, I think is pretty..."
114,c.j.,Josh.
115,josh,"C.J., if one of these guys could throw a split fingered fastball, we’d send in the  USS Eisenhower."
116,c.j.,That’s not entirely true.
117,toby,"Oh, for God’s sake. Forget about the journey. Okay? The voyage is not our problem."
118,c.j.,What’s our problem?
119,toby,"What to do when the Nina, the Pinta, and the Get-Me-The-Hell-Outta-Here hit Miami."
120,leo,Sam?
121,sam,"Can’t send them back. They’ll go to jail, if they’re lucky."
122,toby,We’ll get whacked in what? At least...
123,sam,Three congressional districts. Dade County.
124,toby,Those seats are gone.
125,josh,Not to mention the fact that it’s wrong.
126,sam,Plus that.
127,josh,What about Texas?
128,sam,I wouldn’t worry about it.
129,leo,Keep Josh in the loop on this throughout the day.
130,sam,Me?
131,leo,Yeah.
132,sam,"The thing is, my day is a little tight..."
133,toby,Deal with it.
134,sam,And I’m happy to. It’s just that...
135,leo,Sam.
136,sam,"I’m just saying, isn’t this more of a military area?"
137,leo,Military?
138,sam,Yeah.
139,toby,You think the United States is under attack from 1200 Cubans in rowboats?
140,sam,I’m not saying I don’t like our chances.
141,toby,Mind-boggling to me that we ever won an election.
142,leo,Pat Thomas wants to call up the Guard.
143,josh,He shouldn’t.
144,sam,He’s right.
145,c.j.,"You send in the Guard, you create a panic situation."
146,toby,I agree with Josh. And I agree with C.J.. And I agree with Sam. And you know how  that makes me crazy.
147,leo,Yeah...
148,toby,They’re running for their lives. You don’t have to start a game of Red Rover with  Castro. But you don’t send in the National Guard. You send food and you send doctors. 
149,josh,"Sam, see that I.N.S. is working with the Red Cross and the Centers for Disease Control."
150,sam,I’ve got my guy from CDC on the phone right...
151,leo,Go. Talk to him.
152,sam,Talk to him. 
153,leo,Moving on. Let’s talk about Josh.
154,c.j., Folks? Folks?
155,c.j.,"Good morning. Dr. Randall Haymen, H-A-Y-M-E-N, chief of orthopedics at St. John’s  Hospital has diagnosed the President with a mild sprain in his left ankle sustained  while cycling into a large cyprus tree."
156,c.j.,"Details can be found in the full report that Linda and Susanne are distributing.   Along with pool photographs of the President resisting help from a Secret Service  agent, then falling down again. By all means, enjoy yourselves. Item number two."
157,c.j.,"It’s a light day, Chris. Let’s just get through this, then I’ll take a couple  questions. Item number two, the Association of Retired..."
159,josh,I don’t think it was the tie that got me in trouble.
161,josh,What’s that?
163,josh,Thought so.
165,josh,"What’s going on, Donna?"
167,josh,Donna.
169,josh,"Close the door.   Donnatella Moss, when did you start working for me?"
171,josh,And how long have you been my assistant?
173,josh,And when was the last time you brought me a cup of coffee?  It was never.  You’ve never brought me a cup of coffee.
175,josh,"Donna. If I get fired, I get fired."
177,josh, No.
179,josh,Thanks for the coffee.
181,toby,Donna brought you coffee?
182,josh,‘Sup?
183,toby, What did I tell you before you went on the air yesterday?
184,josh,"You said, ‘don’t get cute with Mary Marsh.’"
185,toby,"I said, ‘don’t get cute with Mary Marsh.’ I said Al Caldwell is not to be treated  like some revival tent clown."
186,josh,Al Caldwell wasn’t there.
187,toby,He sure as hell was watching.
188,josh,"Look, I already took Leo’s morning beating. What do you want?"
189,toby,I want you to keep your job.
190,josh, How?
191,toby,"I’m going to make a suggestion, which might help you out. But I don’t want this  gesture to be mistaken for an indication that I like you."
192,josh,I understand.
193,toby,In preparation for the Sunday morning radio address on family values...
194,josh,When did that get on the schedule?
195,toby,Listen to me for a second...
196,josh,When did it get on the schedule?
197,toby,It’s the regular Sunday morning...
198,josh," Yeah, but when did we schedule family values?"
199,toby,"We scheduled it, Josh, after your smug, taunting, you know, calamitous performance  on ‘Capitol Beat.’  America for better families. The AAF and Al Caldwell.  Mary Marsh. I’ve invited them all for coffee this afternoon, along with a couple  of speechwriters to talk about..."
200,josh,What they want to hear.
201,toby,"Yes. Yes, sir."
202,josh,"If you listen carefully, you can hear two centuries of Presidents rolling over in  their graves."
203,toby,Come to the meeting.
204,josh,No!
205,toby,Come to the meeting and be nice.
206,josh,Why?
207,toby,So C.J. can put it in the papers...
208,josh, Al Caldwell is friends with bad people! I think he should say  so for the common good. Screw politics! How about that?
209,toby, You don’t run social policy for this government. How ‘bout that!
210,josh,Toby! 
211,toby,"I’m in charge of the message around here. It’s my job to tell the President that  the best thing he could do, from a PR standpoint, is to show you the door.  Come to the meeting. Be nice. Keep your job."
212,josh, I’ll be there.
213,josh,What’s that?
214,toby,One of the kids from the newsroom clipped that from the Journal this morning.  Guess who’s leaving Lennox-Chase to start consulting in town? She’s leasing  offices downtown. She starts today.
215,josh,Who’s she working for?
216,toby, I’m checking it out.
217,josh, That’s a good picture of her.
218,leo,"That’s fine, but the President’s gonna look at the WBO revenue analysis and say  that economists were put on this planet to make astrologers look good."
219,leo,Luther. Ballpark. One year from today. Where’s the Dow?
220,leo,Fred. One year from today.
221,leo,A year from today at least one of you is gonna look pretty stupid.
222,leo,"Oh, go. Get out. "
223,sam, There’s a storm system moving into the South Florida area.
224,leo,"See, with any luck the Cubans’ll turn around and live to defect another day."
225,josh,"Yeah, ‘cause they’re probably all tuned to the National Weather Service, but that’s  not what I’m here for."
226,leo,What’s on your mind?
227,josh,"We’ve gotta look at the whole field for a minute, ‘cause I think we’re about to  get tagged."
228,leo,With regard to what?
229,josh,Re-election.
230,leo,"Oh, we’re not there."
231,josh,Don’t let Lloyd Russell push us around on Medicare or medium range missiles.
232,leo,You’re taking Lloyd Russell too seriously.
233,sam,His numbers are starting to get interesting.
234,josh,Hollywood likes him. He can raise money.
235,leo,We’re not there yet.
236,josh,"30 second hypothetical: You’re Lloyd Russell, newly crowned prince of the White  suburban woman, the upper middle class Black man and teacher’s union. You’re no  friend to the sitting President. What do you do?"
237,leo,Put together an exploratory committee.
238,josh,And who do you get to run it?
239,leo,You.
240,josh,I already got a job.
241,leo,For the moment.
242,josh,Who do you get?
243,leo,"Well, if I could get Mandy to leave 900,000 a year at Lennox-Chase, I’d get Mandy."
244,josh,You’d be smart.
245,leo," Hey, come to think of it, you think she’d be interested in his job?"
246,josh,You’re in luck.
247,leo,She’s in town?
248,josh,Just got here today.
249,leo,What she doing?
250,josh,Working for Lloyd Russell.
251,leo, Margaret! Get me Senator Russell’s office  on the phone.
252,sam,Is that the same suit you wore yesterday?
253,josh,Yeah.  You? 
254,sam,Yeah.
255,josh,"Sure.  This is Mandy Hampton. She’s  excellent, too."
256,josh,She used to steal money from me.
257,josh,Yeah. Thanks a lot for stopping by.
258,josh,Sure.
259,josh,See ya. 
260,josh,I really don’t care one way or the other. He’s a lightweight. I just...
261,josh,Not when I can’t use him. No. I just wanna know how much trouble he’s gonna be on  the budget surplus.
262,josh,I have enough friends.
263,josh,"Please, Mandy. It’s not like these people were in our camp to begin with."
264,josh,Did you just call him Lloyd?
265,josh,Senator Russell.
266,josh,"A minute ago. You said ""What do you wanna know? Is-is Lloyd gonna run""?"
267,josh,It’s unusual for you that you would call a Senator by his first name to a third party.
268,josh,You know what I’m saying.
269,josh,You’re dating Lloyd Russell.
270,josh, Wow. That’s great.
271,josh,"No, no, no. Not at all. It’s just -- I always thought he was gay."
272,josh,I did.
273,josh,You sure?
274,josh,He always seemed effeminate to me.
275,josh,I think he’s a woman.
276,josh,I do.
277,josh,This is the first I’m hearing of it.
278,josh,Where’d you get this?
279,josh,"Wait a minute. One minute you’re giving me career advice, the next minute you’re  telling me we don’t play for..."
280,josh,"You and Lloyd Russell, huh?"
281,leo," Seventeen across. Yes. Seventeen across is wrong. You’re spelling  his name wrong. What’s my name? My name doesn’t matter. I’m just an ordinary citizen  who relies on the Times crossword for stimulation. And I’m telling you, that I’ve  met with the man twice, and I’ve recommended a preemptive Exocet Missile attack  against his airforce. So, I think I know how to..."
282,c.j., Leo!
283,leo, They hang up on me. Every time.
284,c.j.,That’s almost hard to believe.
285,leo,What do you need?
286,c.j.,Nightline wants someone for the East Asia...
287,leo,Send Naomi. What else?
288,c.j.,There might be a press leak on A3-C3.
289,leo,That was Hutchison. What else?
290,c.j.,Leo?
291,leo,Please don’t ask me about Josh.
292,c.j.,I was going to ask...
293,leo,I honestly don’t know anything.
294,c.j.,You know the President.
295,leo,So do you.
296,c.j.,You know him better.
297,leo,"I’ve known him forty years, C.J. And all I can promise you is that on any given day  there’s really no predicting what he’s going to choose to care about."
298,c.j.,Yeah.
299,leo,"I’m sorry, I’m late. "
300,sam,The assault stats.
301,sam,We got them from your office.
302,sam,And they’re wrong?
303,sam,"Well, A. Let’s make ‘em right, and B. why can’t I use ‘em?"
304,sam,Who’s the 76 year old--
305,sam,That’s flat-out not true.
306,sam,"The 76 year old grandmother doesn’t defend herself with a modified AK-47 Assault  Rifle, Larry.  Unless she’s defending herself against Turkish rebels. "
307,sam,"Oh, you guys know my assistant Cathy?"
308,sam,"Ah, right.  Call me at the end of the day. [walks with Cathy"
309,sam,That woman hates me.
310,sam,What’d I do?
311,sam,Yes. I meant recently. I meant why did she call.
312,sam,"For the hundredth time, I didn’t know who she was, and how long am I gonna be  crucified for that?"
313,sam,"Most women, I would think, would be flattered that..."
314,sam,What’d she want?
315,sam,I can’t.
316,sam,"No really, I can’t. I’m not a good tour guide. I don’t know anything about the White  House. "
317,sam," Oh God, please let this be a national emergency."
318,sam, Hi. You paged me?
319,sam, This is Sam Seaborn.
320,sam, Who’s this?
321,sam, Page me.
322,sam,I’m standing right here. Page me and punch in my number.
323,sam,A woman’s about to call me. She’s not gonna know why. Put her through. Hello?
324,sam, Laurie?
325,sam, It’s Sam.
326,sam, Sam Seaborn.
327,sam," Yeah, ah, actually you called me. And that’s because you have my  pager. And I have yours. "
328,sam," Yeah. Look, listen, can I come by and see you real quick?"
329,sam, Thanks... Good... Okay.
330,c.j.,"Guys, I don’t have a lot of time to answer questions right now."
331,c.j.,But that shouldn’t stop you from asking them anyway. Chris?
332,c.j.,None that I’m aware of.
333,c.j.,"Seriously, that’s it. I’ll get you wheels down time when I’ve got it. "
334,toby,They’re picking up the scent.
335,c.j.,Billy is. The rest of ‘em are picking up Billy’s scent.
336,toby,Josh is gonna come to the coffee.
337,c.j.,Keep him cool.
338,leo,"President’s a deeply religious man, Reverend. I don’t need to tell you that."
339,leo,He’s worked with the Southern Baptist Leadership Conference. He’s worked with  the Catholic Relief...
340,leo,"Yes, he has. He also spent eight months traveling around the country discouraging  young women from having abortions."
341,leo,He doesn’t believe that it’s the government’s place to legislate this issue. But  that has not stopped him from playing his role as a moral leader. Something which  cost him dearly in the campaign and you know that.
342,leo,Because your group has plenty of demons.
343,leo,"You don’t have to tell me about it, Reverend. I’m a member of the Democratic Party."
344,leo,"Forgive me, Al. But when you stand that close to Mary Marsh and John Van Dyke, it’s  sometimes hard not to paint you all with the same brush."
345,leo,"I don’t think you do, but I recognize you’re in a tough spot."
346,leo,"Oh, I know you’re not, Al. And I think that you and I can keep this from escalating  beyond the petulant woman being angry about getting her hair a little messed up on T.V."
347,leo,What?
348,leo,No one’s saying...
349,leo,"You don’t think we’re taking this seriously? 24 hours ago, the President ordered  me to fire Josh Lyman. I’ve been trying to talk him down from it ever since. He’s  getting off the plane in ten minutes. It’s 6 to 5 at pickin’ whether Josh still  has a job. Now, I don’t know how much more seriously we can take it."
350,leo,"Yes, it is.  Anyway, I’m glad Toby organized your meeting  this afternoon."
351,sam,Hi.
352,sam,Can I come in?
353,sam, This is a nice apartment.
354,sam,"Yeah, and I really like it."
355,sam,It makes very good use of space.
356,sam,The way the ladle hangs from the pegboard.
357,sam,Right.
358,sam,"Um, can I ask you something?"
359,sam,"No. No. What I was gonna say is this: Is it possible, that in addition to being a  law student and part-time bartender, that you are what I’m certain would have to be  a very high-priced call girl. I, by the way, making no judgments. The thing is,  with my job--"
360,sam,Yes?
361,sam,I do. I gotta go. 
362,sam,Yeah?
363,sam,"Oh, right. "
364,sam,"Listen, I don’t know how often you get up..."
365,sam,It’s just that there are people who’d pay a lot of money for...
366,josh,No.
368,josh,No.
370,josh,No.
375,sam,I’m having kind of a weird day. 
376,sam,I don’t know what to say to them.
377,sam,I need someone to tell me about the building and its history.
378,sam,I can’t fake it.
379,sam,Which one is Leo’s daughter?
380,sam,I want to make a good impression. What does she look like?
381,sam,Okay. I just want to thank you for all of your help. 
382,sam,"Hi, I’m sorry to be late."
383,sam,Hi.
384,sam,"Well, that’s just great, why don’t we get started.  My name  is Sam Seaborn and I’m the Deputy Communications Director. What does that mean  exactly? Well, to begin with, I’m a counselor to the President, mostly on domestic  matters, though generally not security related. I work with Toby Ziegler, the  Communications Director; and C.J. Cregg, the Press Secretary, on crafting our  message and getting it out through the electronic and print media. And while my  functions here are generally perceived to be politically skewed, it’s important to  remember that it is not the D.N.C., but rather your tax dollars that pay my salary.  So I work for you whether you voted for us or not."
385,sam,Sure. I graduated law school eight years ago and started working for  Dewey-Ballantine where I--
386,sam,The White House.
387,sam,"Sure.  The White House, as you know, was built several years ago. Mostly, if  I’m not mistaken, out of cement. The room we’re in right now, the Roosevelt Room,  is very famous. It is named for our 18th President, Franklin Delano Roosevelt. The  chairs that you’re sitting on today were fashioned from the lumber of a pirate ship  captured during the Spanish-American--"
388,sam,How ya doin’?
389,sam,"In this particular area, yes."
390,sam,Really?
391,sam,I should’ve put two and two together.
392,sam,"Look, the thing is, while there are really a great many things I can speak with  authority, I’m not good at talking about the White House."
393,sam,"Ironic, isn’t it?"
394,sam,Wait a minute. Wait. Please. Could you do me favor? Could you tell me which one of  those kids is Leo McGarry’s daughter?
395,sam,"Well, if I could make eye contact with her, make her laugh, you know, just see that  she has a good time, it might go a long way toward making my life easier."
396,sam,"Ms. O’Brian, I understand your feelings, but please believe me when I tell you that  I’m a nice guy having a bad day. I just found out the Times is publishing a poll  that says a considerable portion of Americans feel that the White House has lost  energy and focus. A perception that’s not likely to be altered by the video footage  of the President riding his bicycle into a tree. As we speak, the Coast Guard are  fishing Cubans out of the Atlantic Ocean while the Governor of Florida wants to  blockade the Port of Miami. A good friend of mine’s about to get fired for going on  television and making sense, and it turns out I accidentally slept with a prostitute  last night. Now. Would you please, in the name of compassion, tell me which one of  those kids is my boss’s daughter."
397,sam,You.
398,sam,Leo’s daughter’s fourth grade class.
399,sam," Well, this is bad on so many levels."
400,c.j.,"She’s gonna try and bait you, Josh, you understand what I’m saying?"
401,josh,"Lloyd Russell. Yeah, that’ll last."
402,c.j.,Are you listening to me?
403,josh, They’re gonna try and bait me.
404,c.j.,They want you to say something arrogant.
405,josh,I don’t need baiting for that.
406,toby,"Hi. Hi, good afternoon. We apologize. We’re running a bit behind today."
407,c.j.,"It’s a mild sprain, he’ll be fine."
408,c.j.,Yes.
409,toby,"Everybody, sit, sit, sit. We’re happy you all could come talk with us today. As  you know, the President makes a usual Sunday morning radio address, and in a few  weeks we’ve scheduled--"
410,josh,"Yes, I know, and I’m glad you brought that up..."
411,josh,"And I’m honored by that, Reverend. First, let me say that when I spoke on the  program yesterday, I was not speaking for the President or this administration.  That’s important to know. Second, please allow me to apologize. My remarks were glib  and insulting. I was going for the cheap laugh, and anybody willing to step up and  debate ideas deserves better than a political punch line. Mary, I apologize."
412,toby, I’m sorry?
413,toby,For what?
414,toby,"Well, like Josh said..."
415,toby,An apology.
416,toby,School prayer or pornography?
417,toby,I’ve seen it. Mary...
418,toby,What?!
419,toby,"Well, that’s a problem."
420,toby, We have a Surgeon General who says they dramatically reduce the  risk of teen pregnancy and AIDS.
421,toby,Show the average American teenage male a lug wrench and his mind’ll turn...
422,c.j.,Toby!
423,toby,We’re not prepared to make any sort of deal right now.
424,josh,Sure we are. Mary...
425,josh,Yes.
426,josh,"I’m actually from Connecticut, but that’s neither here nor there. The point is, Mary..."
427,toby,"She meant Jewish.  When she said ""New  York sense of humor"", she was talking about you and me."
428,josh,"You know what, Toby, let’s just not even go there."
429,toby," I’m afraid that’s just tough, Mrs. Marsh."
430,toby,No it doesn’t.
431,josh,Toby--
432,toby,It doesn’t.
433,josh,Listen--
434,toby,"No, if I’m gonna make you sit through this preposterous exercise, we’re gonna get  the names of the damn commandments right."
435,toby,"""Honor thy Father"" is the Third Commandment."
436,bartlet,"Al. What do we got here, C.J.?"
437,c.j.,"Well, we’ve got some hot tempers, Mr. President."
438,bartlet,Mary.
439,bartlet,Yes. Reverend?
440,bartlet,Of course.
441,bartlet,No.
442,bartlet,"On the other hand, I do think that five dollars is too high a price to pay for  pornography."
443,c.j.,Why don’t we all sit down?
444,bartlet,"No. Let’s not, C.J. These people won’t be staying that long. May I have some coffee,  Mr. Lewis? Al, how many times have I asked you to denounce the practices of a fringe  group that calls itself The Lambs of God?"
445,bartlet,"Crap. It is up to you, Al. You, know, my wife, Abbey, she never wants me to do  anything while I’m upset.  Except I forgot to open the garage door."
446,bartlet,Find it now.
447,leo,See that you do.
448,josh,"Okay, can I just say that, as it turned out, I was the calmest person in the room?"
449,toby,Hey...
450,c.j.,Way to stay cool.
451,toby,I am not empowered to auction off the Bill of Rights.
452,josh,I thought you were going to take a swing at her there.
453,toby,"She was calling us New York Jews, Josh."
454,josh,"Yeah, but being from Connecticut, I didn’t mind so much.  You, C.J., on the other hand, were brilliant. I particularly liked the part where  you said nothing at all."
455,c.j.,"I’m sorry, Josh, I was distracted. All I could really think about was Lloyd Russell  and your girlfriend."
456,sam,Mandy and Lloyd Russell?
457,josh,I’ll be puttin’ an end to that.
458,bartlet,"""Hello, Mr. President. Did you have a nice trip, sir? How’s the ankle, sir?""  Seems to me we’ve all been taking a little break. Thinking about our personal lives  or thinking about keeping our jobs. Breaks are good. It’s not a bad idea taking a  break every now and then. I know how hard you all work."
459,bartlet," With the clothes on their  backs, they came through a storm. And the ones that didn’t die want a better life.  And they want it here. Talk about impressive. My point is this: Break’s over."
460,leo,"Thank you, Mr. President."
461,bartlet,"Josh. ""Too busy being indicted for tax fraud""?  Don’t ever do it again."
462,bartlet, Mrs. Landingham. What’s next?
463,josh, Victory is mine! Victory is mine! Great day in the  morning people. Victory is mine!
465,josh,"I drink from the keg of glory, Donna. Bring me the finest muffins and bagels in  all the land."
467,toby,I don’t understand.
468,c.j.,They refused.
469,toby,How did they refuse?
470,c.j.,They turned down. They declined the invitation.
471,toby,How does someone decline an invitation for a photo-op with the President?
472,c.j.,I’m saying this is the kind of luck we’re having.
473,toby,Because of the joke?
474,c.j.,Because of the joke.
475,toby,Good morning.
476,c.j.,Who’s that?
477,toby,Who cares? We need somebody.
478,c.j.,You try getting his attention on this.
479,toby,"Mrs. Landingham, does the President have free time this morning?"
480,toby,"Sarcasm’s a disturbing thing coming from a woman of your age, Mrs. Landingham."
481,toby,Late twenties?
482,toby, Can I have a cookie?
483,sam," Toby, they turned down our request?"
484,toby,C.J.’s on it.
485,sam,Good morning.
486,sam,Thank you. 
487,c.j.,They’re issuing a press release. We’re gonna be playing defense all day.
488,sam, Is this really because of the joke?
489,c.j.,It’s because of the joke.
490,josh,"Someone give me a river to forge, a serpent to slay."
491,c.j., What’s his problem?
493,toby,We heard. 
494,sam,Good job.
495,josh,"Thank you very much. C.J., they turned down the invitation?"
496,c.j.,They declined.
497,josh,What does that mean?
498,c.j.,It means they turned down the invitation.
499,josh,Because of the joke?
500,c.j.,"Of course, because of the joke. Why does everyone keep asking? As if it could  be something..."
501,leo,...32 billion against the trade surplus.
502,bartlet,That’s no good. Jaworski knows that’s no good.
503,leo,"Mostly, he’s gonna say that the Japanese need to buy more American cars."
504,bartlet,Americans need to buy more American cars.
505,leo,Which is what I told Jaworski.
506,bartlet,Good morning everyone.
507,bartlet,What do you got?
508,josh,443’s gonna stay in committee.
509,bartlet,I heard.
510,leo,What else?
511,c.j.,The Ryder Cup team is declining our invitation to come to the White House.
512,leo,You’re kidding.
513,c.j.,Because of the joke.
514,bartlet,You’re kidding.
515,c.j.,I’m not.
516,bartlet,The Ryder Cup team?
517,c.j.,It’s a group of the best golfers in the country...
518,bartlet,I know what the Ryder Cup team is. Thanks Mrs. Landingham.
519,c.j.,"Sir, this may be a good time to talk about your sense of humor."
520,bartlet," I’ve got an intelligence briefing, a security briefing,  and a 90-minute budget meeting all scheduled for the same 45 minutes. You sure  this is a good time to talk about my sense of humor?"
521,c.j.,No.
522,bartlet,Me neither.
523,leo,What else?
524,c.j.,It’s just that it’s not the first time it’s happened.
525,bartlet,I know.
526,toby,"She’s talking about Texas, sir."
527,bartlet,I know.
528,c.j.,U.S.A. Today asks you why you don’t spend more time campaigning in Texas and  you say it’s ‘cause you don’t look good in funny hats.
529,sam,It was “big hats.”
530,c.j.,What difference does it make?
531,bartlet,It makes a difference.
532,c.j.,The point is we got whomped in Texas.
533,josh,We got whomped in Texas twice.
534,c.j.,"We got whomped in the primary, and we got whomped in November."
535,bartlet,I think I was there.
536,c.j.,"And it was avoidable, sir."
537,bartlet,"C.J., on your tombstone, it’s gonna read, “Post hoc, ergo propter hoc.”"
538,c.j.,"Okay, but none of my visitors are going to be able to understand my tombstone."
539,bartlet,"Twenty-seven lawyers in the room, anybody know “post hoc, ergo propter hoc?”  Josh?"
540,josh,"Uh, uh, post, after, after hoc, ergo, therefore, after hoc, therefore,  something else hoc."
541,bartlet,Thank you. Next?
542,josh,"Uh, if I’d gotten more credit on the 443..."
543,bartlet,Leo?
544,leo,"After it, therefore because of it. "
545,bartlet,"After it, therefore because of it. It means one thing follows the other,  therefore it was caused by the other, but it’s not always true. In fact, it’s  hardly ever true. We did not lose Texas because of the hat joke. Do you know  when we lost Texas?"
546,c.j.,When you learned to speak Latin?
547,bartlet,Go figure.
548,leo,What else?
549,leo,"Sam, when are you writing the Hilton Head draft?"
550,sam,I’m closing my door from noon to three.
551,josh,Let me see it at three.
552,sam,Yeah.
553,leo,Morris.
554,leo,"Stan, I’ll be just a second.  Take a walk with me, will you?"
555,leo,You look well.
556,leo,How’s the baby?
557,leo,You got a picture?
558,leo,"Oh, she’s a knockout."
559,leo,I’m sorry. I’ve forgotten your wife’s name.
560,leo,And the girl?
561,leo,I may have.
562,leo, Here. It’s a baby and a new mother. Look at that for a  minute.
563,leo,"Listen, quickly. I know you were just supposed to be filling in till Terry  Wyatt came back, but the President likes you, and he’d like to keep you on if  you don’t have any objections."
564,leo,Good.
565,leo,Where are you going?
566,leo,For how long?
567,leo,Then you’ll start the week after.
568,leo,Yeah?
569,leo,"He likes you, Morris. He feels better after he’s talked to you. I think there  have been days when you’ve lightened the load a little."
570,leo,"He likes you, Morris. I got to get back in the Oval.  Give him his  picture."
572,josh,What do you need?
574,josh,For what?
576,josh,Without telling me?
578,josh,How did I do?
580,josh,On who?
582,josh,What was the line?
584,josh,What kind of a pool was it?
586,josh,You picked Central Indiana State?
588,josh,Who are they playing?
590,josh,You picked Central Indiana State against Notre Dame?
592,josh,Toby!
593,toby,Yes.
594,josh,We need to do something.
595,toby,Ryder Cup team.
596,josh,The Ryder Cup is just the latest in a string.
597,toby,Yes.
598,josh,The banking committee...
599,toby,"New Jersey, G-8."
600,josh,Bicycle under the tree?
601,toby,"Yes, though I’m not sure what our new media director would have done about that."
602,josh,"Me neither, but we need a new media director. I’d been on talent shows with  more polish than some of the events around here."
603,toby,On talent shows?
604,josh,As a kid. Listen...
605,toby,On what if?
606,josh,We need to double-team him.
607,toby,If we bring Sam and C.J. too.
608,josh,We need to gang up on.
609,toby,Yes.
610,josh,We do it as a gang.
611,toby,See you later.
612,josh,"Listen, it’s not gonna be Mandy, right?"
613,toby,Nope.
614,josh,Anyone but Mandy.
615,c.j.,“Post hoc ergo propter hoc”? I’ll bet that used to have them rolling in the  aisles at the Whiffinpoof Dinners.
616,toby,Fly in the teeth with it.
617,c.j.,You think?
618,toby,Be funny. You’re at your best with a pie in the face.
619,c.j.,I’ve been told that.
620,toby,"In fact, I’d hold back. Keep it in your back pocket."
621,c.j.,Janet?
622,toby,"If you don’t like the rhythm of the “Q” and “A,” use the Ryder Cup. Just fly in  the teeth with it."
623,c.j.,Yeah.
624,c.j.,"Good morning. We got a birthday today, right? Suzanne?"
625,c.j.,It’s Bobbi’s birthday!
626,c.j.,"No. I can’t, Mike. I haven’t spoken with the Vice President today."
627,c.j., Strange?
628,c.j.,"It sounds pretty straightforward. I’ll tell you what though, if you consult the  morning releases, you’ll see that in the world of sports, the White House just  got dissed by 12 guys named Flippy."
629,c.j.,Who’s got questions?
630,c.j.," I have to say that it came as a bit of a surprise to discover that  professional golfers don’t have a sense of humor, especially after seeing them  in some of the outfits."
631,sam,Hey.
632,josh,Hey.
633,sam,What’s up?
634,c.j., Thank you...
635,josh," C.J. just discovered that Hoynes, when responding to  a question on A3, said “this is the time when the President needs our support.”  Third one in five weeks."
636,sam,So she moved on to the Ryder Cup?
637,josh,Wouldn’t you?
638,sam,"Yeah.  Listen, make sure C.J. keeps this off Leo’s desk."
639,josh,I think it goes right on Leo’s desk.
640,sam,A vague quote from Hoynes will disappear by the end of the next news cycle.  A fistfight between Leo and the Vice President’s got juice.
641,josh,Fair point.
642,sam,Talk to C.J.
643,josh,Yeah. I will.
644,josh,Did you need me?
645,sam,I’m sorry?
646,josh,Didn’t you come to see me?
647,sam,I was just stretching my legs.
648,josh,Oh.
649,sam,"I’m supposed to be working on the Hilton Head draft right now, and I am, but  I’m just stretching my legs."
650,josh,Okay.
651,sam,"Last week, I was out for a late drink, and I met this woman named Laurie, and  Laurie and I hit it off, and we spent the evening together back at her place,  and the next day I discovered she was a call girl."
652,josh,Sam?
653,sam,Yeah?
654,josh,Do you want to maybe close the door?
655,sam,Yeah.  
656,josh,You slept with a call girl?
657,sam,"Well no, I... well, yes. Yes I did."
658,josh,Did she know who you are?
659,sam,"No, I didn’t reveal my secret identity, Josh."
660,josh,I’m asking some questions here.
661,sam,Yes. She knows I work for the President.
662,josh,You don’t think that she...
663,sam,No.
664,josh,Let me finish...
665,sam,"No, I’m saying no, she wouldn’t say anything."
666,josh,How do you know?
667,sam,I know.
668,josh,How do you know?
669,sam,I know.
670,josh,"You want to call her again, don’t you?"
671,sam,"Look, I really like her, and she’s not what you think."
672,josh,The only thing I know about her is she’s a call girl. Is she a call girl?
673,sam,Yes.
674,josh,Then so far she’s exactly what I think.
675,sam,I just think I left abruptly. I think it was rude.
676,josh,"Oh, you’re gonna try and reform her, aren’t you?"
677,sam,No.
678,josh,You are.
679,sam,"I just didn’t say a proper goodbye that, you know, shows a little respect."
680,josh,Sam...
681,sam,"You know what, you’d like her if you met her, Josh."
682,josh,"You got to promise me this is never gonna happen, Sam."
683,josh,Yes?
685,josh,Thanks.
687,josh,Nothing.
689,josh,Yes.
691,josh,Yes.
693,josh,"Yes.  Look, whatever quest..."
694,sam,It’s not a quest.
695,josh,Whatever. You’re playing with fire here. Just talk to Toby before you do  anything.
696,sam,Toby?
697,josh,Yes.
698,sam,There’s no way that I can do this without talking to Toby?
699,josh,No.  Just talk to Toby. Just Toby.
700,sam,All right.
702,josh,Thank you. C.J....
703,c.j.,"I’m gonna kill him, Josh."
704,josh,I would definitely talk to him.
705,c.j.,"Oh, I’m gonna talk to him, all right."
706,josh,I want you to stay on the perimeter.
707,c.j.,I’ve been staying on the perimeter.
708,josh,I don’t want it on Leo’s desk. Thank you
709,c.j.,Hey Stevie.
710,c.j.,Does he have a minute?
711,c.j.,It’ll just be a minute.
712,c.j.,"Excuse me, Mr. Vice President?"
713,c.j.,"Sir, I-I wanted to talk to you for a moment about A3-C3."
714,c.j.,"I wanted to apologize since I’ve been quickly here and in getting everyone on  the same page, sometimes people get left behind for a day or two..."
715,c.j.,I was saying that had we properly briefed your office...
716,c.j.,Sir?
717,c.j.,"The quote the room is running with is, “This is the time when the President  needs our support.”"
718,c.j.,"Well, you can see how that might be interpreted...?"
719,c.j.,"Yes, sir?"
720,c.j.,"Yes, sir."
721,c.j.,"Yes, sir."
722,bartlet,What’s in Jordan?
723,bartlet,"You should stay here. We got Amman, a woman, little kids, the works."
724,bartlet,"See, that was a joke."
725,bartlet,Everybody’s a critic today.
726,bartlet,So what’s in Amman?
727,bartlet,Good for you. How long are you gonna stay?
728,bartlet,When do you leave?
729,bartlet,What’s my temperature?
730,bartlet,Fahrenheit?
731,bartlet, So how’s the kid?
732,bartlet,Can she spell anything yet?
733,bartlet,Got any pictures?
734,bartlet,"Thank you, Nancy."
735,bartlet,"Oh, she’s beautiful. What’s her name?"
736,bartlet,That name’s got a hell of a past.
737,bartlet,Your wife’s beautiful too. How’d you get her to marry you? Did you trick her  or something?
738,bartlet,"Yeah, I figured.  Morris, I made a joke about golfers yesterday, and now  it consumes the whole damn building."
739,bartlet,"Jokes like that are part of my folksy charm, Morris. It’s the very heart of my  popularity."
740,bartlet,"Oh, we’re having some difficulty getting the word out."
741,bartlet,"Oh, thank you. Is this from this morning, Carol?"
742,bartlet, So how’s my pulse?
743,bartlet,No.
744,bartlet,Yeah.
745,bartlet,Yeah.
746,bartlet," Yeah, why not? Two Dewars on the rocks, Mrs. Landingham."
747,bartlet,"I had a meeting this morning with the Joint Chiefs.  I’m an accomplished  man, Morris. I can sit comfortably with prime ministers and Presidents, even  the pope. Why is it every time I sit with the Joint Chiefs, I feel like I’m  back at my father’s dinner table."
748,bartlet,"You’re a naval officer. You’re a doctor in a uniform.  It’s not like I’m  totally without experience, you know. "
749,bartlet,You’re talking to a former governor. I was commander-in-chief of the New  Hampshire National Guard.
750,bartlet,"Didn’t have to. We’d just stand on the border and stare you down. Then we’d all  go for pancakes. Like you had a lot of closed infantry combat training in  premed, huh?"
751,bartlet,What is that?
752,bartlet,I don’t need a flu shot.
753,bartlet,How do I know this isn’t the start of a military coup?
754,bartlet,I want the Secret Service in here right away.
755,bartlet,Now that’s a thought that’s gonna fester.
756,bartlet,"Thank you. I’m not comfortable with violence.  I know this country has  enemies, but I don’t feel violent toward any of them. I don’t know whether  that’s a weakness or not, but I think I know how the Joint Chiefs would answer  that question."
757,bartlet,And the red meat.
758,bartlet,Don’t forget your picture. Corey’s a beautiful child.
759,bartlet,"You didn’t do nothing, mister. You were a passenger on this one. Your job is to  pay the bills, and do what these ladies tell you to do."
760,bartlet,"Also, you got to teach her how to whistle. Her mother won’t do that."
761,bartlet,"I’ll see you next week, Morris."
762,bartlet,Right.  Morris?
763,bartlet,Look at that picture again. See? The past isn’t the only thing your family can  be proud of.
764,bartlet,Go away.
765,leo,"Mr. President, you remember Stuart White and Ray Finley?"
766,bartlet,"I do, indeed. Mr. White, good to see you. Mr. Finley..."
768,josh,Yeah.
770,josh,Another hundred bucks?
772,josh,I see it different.
774,josh,"Tell you what, can you give me Yeshiva University over the Dallas Cowboys?"
776,c.j., Excuse me. Leo will be ready for us in about a half hour.
777,josh,"Thanks. Ah, C.J.?"
778,c.j.,Yes?
779,josh,Did you talk to Hoynes?
780,c.j.,Yeah.
781,josh,And?
782,c.j.,We’re fine.
783,josh,You’re sure?
784,c.j.,Yeah
785,c.j.,We’re fine.
786,josh,Okay.
787,c.j.,Leo will call when he’s ready.
788,josh,Anyone but Mandy.
789,c.j.,Right. 
790,sam, Okay.
791,sam,I’m done.
792,sam,Yep.
793,sam,Yes.
794,sam,"I’m done tweaking, I’m done polishing. Done. Take it to C.J.  Yes, I’m  done, really."
795,toby,Wait and hope that the statement comes out of the U.N. by the end of the week.
796,toby,"No, actually the U.N. is already doing the least they can do."
797,sam,Just stretching my legs.
798,toby, Hey.
799,sam,Hey.
800,toby,How’s it going?
801,sam,I’m finished.
802,toby,You’re talking about the Hilton head draft?
803,sam,"I used pretty tough language... “political cover,” “counterproductive.”"
804,toby,Good.
805,sam,"Now, I’m just stretching my legs."
806,toby,Good.
807,sam,Can I talk to you a second?
808,toby,Yeah.
809,sam,I’ll shut the door.
810,toby,Okay.
811,sam," About a week ago, I accidentally slept with a  prostitute."
812,toby,Really?
813,sam,Yes.
814,toby,You accidentally slept with a prostitute?
815,sam,Call girl.
816,toby,Accidentally?
817,sam,Yes.
818,toby,I don’t understand. Did you trip over something?
819,sam,I did not know she was a call girl.
820,toby,There wasn’t a red flag when she charged you money in exchange for sex?
821,sam,"She didn’t charge me, Toby, come on... I didn’t find out about it, till the  next day."
822,toby,Where did you meet her?
823,sam,The Four Seasons.
824,toby,Did anyone see you?
825,sam,No.
826,toby,You’re sure?
827,sam,"Yes, although I was with Billy for a time."
828,toby,Billy who?
829,sam,Kenworthy.
830,toby,Bill Kenworthy...
831,sam,Yes.
832,toby,...of The Wall Street Journal!
833,sam,"He sat, to talk to me about Josh. It was during the whole Mary Marsh thing, but  he got up and left well before..."
834,toby,Before you picked up a hooker.
835,sam,Call girl.
836,toby,"Well, that’s a distinction that’s gonna be very important to the Grand Jury."
837,sam,I haven’t broken any laws.
838,toby,Who else knows about this?
839,sam,Josh.
840,toby,And who else?
841,sam,That’s it.
842,toby,"So it’s just me, you, the hooker, the President’s deputy chief of staff, and  The Wall Street Journal!"
843,sam,You know what Toby? She’s not a hooker.
844,toby,"Hang on a second, Sam."
845,sam,"I’d like to call her, just to say we can be friends, I don’t see the danger in  that..."
846,toby," No, no, Sam, no. You’re going to try and reform her?"
847,sam,No.
848,toby,I think you are.
849,sam,"I think she shouldn’t have to feel like trash, because I have a job where  adults aren’t given the benefit of the doubt."
850,josh, Let’s go.
851,sam,He’s free?
852,josh,Yeah.
853,toby,  Did you know about this?
854,josh,Know about what?
855,toby, With him. 
856,josh,Yes.
857,toby,And you’re not concerned?
858,josh,"Who among us hasn’t known forbidden love, Toby? Why spring break alone..."
859,sam,I was going to say...
860,toby,"This administration doesn’t even need an opposition party, do you know that, we  do fine by ourselves."
861,josh,"Sam, just don’t do anything stupid okay?"
862,sam,Yeah.
863,josh,Nice job on the Hilton head draft.
864,leo,"You have three minutes, what do you want?"
865,toby,A full time consultant.
866,leo,The dollar is down 3 cents against the Yen; up 2 pennies against the Euro. Know  what we need more than a media consultant?  An economic stimulus package that  doesn’t look like it was put together at an Amway rally.
867,josh,"Yes, but that’s not the meeting we’re having right now."
868,leo,Fair point.
869,josh,The Ryder Cup shouldn’t have even ended up on our radar screen.
870,leo,That’s right.
871,josh,So you’ll let us hire a media consultant? You’ll let the D.N.C. spend some  money?
872,leo,Absolutely.
873,toby,Who do we get?
874,leo,Mandy.
875,toby,Excellent choice.
876,josh,"Yes... Wait, What?"
877,sam,Mandy.
878,c.j.,"Who is recently unemployed, and by the way, I don’t think Josh has gotten  enough credit for that. "
879,leo,"We need her again, Josh."
880,josh,Mandy?
881,leo,We need her.
882,josh,Wait a second. This is an ambush.
883,leo,Can you think...?
884,josh,I’m getting mugged and you’re the gang leader.
885,leo,Can you think of a single reason not to use Mandy that isn’t personal?
886,josh,Sure.
887,leo,What?
888,josh, She used to be my girlfriend!
889,leo,That’s good enough for me. Let’s do it.
890,toby,Excellent.
891,josh,Hang on.
892,sam,This is going to be great.
893,josh,"Wait, I-I have certain objections."
894,leo,Like what?
895,josh,"For one thing, the President would never go for this."
896,leo,Sure he will.
897,josh,How do you know?
898,josh,All right... listen... fine... I’m a team player. I think my record is pretty  clear on that.
899,leo,Yes.
900,josh,As long as she understands that she answers to me and she answers to Toby. I  don’t want to have to go 15 rounds with her in the Oval Office.
901,leo,"Toby, does that wrap it up?"
902,toby,Yeah.
903,leo,"Thank you, everybody."
904,josh,"I’m going to draw a chart for her with lines and arrows, clearly indicating  that she answers to me and she answers to Toby."
905,leo,"C.J., hang on a second. "
906,leo,Did you talk to Hoynes today?
907,c.j.,"Yeah, I talked to him for a minute this morning."
908,leo,About A3-C3?
909,c.j.,Yep.
910,leo,I mean about the quote.
911,c.j.,Yeah.
912,leo,And?
913,c.j.,"Miscommunication, he’s on board."
914,leo,Yeah?
915,c.j.,Yeah.
916,leo,"I don’t understand, what kind of miscommunication?"
917,c.j.,"His statement got truncated, I’d leave it alone."
918,leo,Okay.
919,c.j.,Anything else?
920,leo,No.
921,c.j.,I’ll be in my office.
922,josh,She answers to me and she answers to Toby. 
923,bartlet,Mrs. Landingham?
924,bartlet,"I’m done, right?"
925,bartlet,All righty. Thank you. What’s in the bag?
926,bartlet,It’s a shirt.
927,bartlet,They left me a shirt?
928,bartlet,"I think they left me something else, Mrs. Landingham."
929,bartlet,"I think they left me 12 center-cut prime fillet Omaha Steaks, Mrs. Landingham."
930,bartlet,I was going to have Mario fix me one of those steaks tonight. 
931,bartlet,You stole my steaks.
932,bartlet,"You are a cattle rustler, Mrs. Landingham."
933,bartlet,"Between you and Dr. Tolliver, who needs a wife or a mother?"
934,josh,Bartlet.
935,josh,What about Bartlet?
936,josh,"Jed Bartlet, Nobel Laureate in Economics, three-term congressman, two-term  Governor, You guys look like you could use a client. What do you say? You want  to work for the leader of the free world?"
937,josh,Ow!
938,josh,Okay...
939,josh,"Okay, we have some rules."
940,josh,"Number one, she can’t punch me. Number two, I prefer it if the two of you  didn’t get drunk in the middle of the day."
941,josh,"Yes, I really am quite something."
942,josh,The look on Mandy’s face is thanks enough. Get your coats. You hungry?
943,josh,"Lets go. Rule number 3, and I really can’t emphasize this enough, you answer to  me and you answer to Toby. My office is drawing up some instructional charts  that pretty much outline the chain of command. For instance, you answer to me  and you answer to Toby."
944,josh,Do you?
945,josh,Good.
946,josh,Mandy!
947,leo,Thanks.
948,leo,Good evening Mr. Vice President.
949,leo,"Thanks, Margaret."
950,leo,How was New York?
951,leo,Good.
952,leo,No.
953,leo,Did you blow off C.J. Cregg this morning?
954,leo,I’m asking...
955,leo,Did you?
956,leo,"C.J. did not come running, John, she covered your ass, she’s a good girl. And  when she tells you something, I want you to consider it a directive from this  office."
957,leo,Yes.
958,leo,You really want to do this now?
959,leo, Excuse me! Me and my pal?
960,leo,You are referring to President Bartlet?
961,leo,Refer to him that way.
962,leo,"Don’t do what you’re doing, John."
963,leo,"‘Cause I’ll win, and you’ll end up playing celebrity golf for the rest of your  life."
964,leo,"Give this President anything less than your full-throated support, and you’re  going to find out exactly how long."
965,leo,"Goodnight, John."
966,sam,Excuse me. Hi.
967,sam,I’m looking for Laurie.
968,sam,Laurie’s not her real name.
969,sam,"Actually, Laurie is her real name. The name you know her by is not her real  name. I saw her with you the other night."
970,sam,Ah. More good news for Toby.
971,sam,Nothing. Could you tell me where she is?
972,sam,Thank you. 
973,sam,Only take a sec!
974,sam,Hi.
975,sam,"Look at this. I come in for a drink, and here you are."
976,sam,How you doing?
977,sam,Sam Seaborn.
978,sam,"Yes, sir. "
979,sam,I hope you don’t mind my barging in like this. It’s just that I’ve known this  girl my whole life.
980,sam,Who’s Brittany?
981,sam,Okay.
982,sam,"No problem. I don’t mean to interrupt. I’ll just go back to the bar and call  my friend, the Assistant U.S. Attorney General, and see if he wants to come  down and meet for a drink with me and that woman back there."
983,sam, Okay.
984,sam,Laurie. I called you four times. You said you were gonna call me back.
985,sam,Laurie?
986,sam,I came here in the spirit of...
987,sam,"If I cost you some money, I’ll write you a check."
988,sam,I wasn’t...  I’m sorry.  That was the wrong thing to say.
989,sam,You’re gonna freeze out here.
990,sam,Take my coat.
991,sam,Come on.
992,sam,Are you...?
993,sam,You’re absolutely right about that.
994,sam,So I had a pretty good day.
995,sam,I feel like more and more I’m putting a role in policy discussions and then  today I...
996,sam,What?
997,sam,I just... to tell you that I had a pretty good day.
998,sam,"Yeah, you do."
999,sam,You and any kid with a decent paper route.
1000,sam,Really?
1001,sam,I wouldn’t knock yourself out in torts because there’s no state law in this  country that’s gonna admit you with a solicitation bust on your record.
1002,sam,As opposed to the other people that do?
1003,sam,And I gotta tell you...  I think you look terrific tonight.
1004,sam,And I’m not just saying that because I want my coat back.
1005,sam,"I’m a lawyer and a speechwriter. I argue for a living, and I’m sought after  because I’m good at it."
1006,sam,Yeah.
1007,sam,I guess that’s just the way it goes.
1008,sam,It’s gonna have to be.
1009,sam,‘Cause I’ve decided to become a good friend of yours.
1010,sam,No.
1011,sam,Really.
1012,sam,"I don’t know, but whatever it is, can we do it indoors because I’m from  Southern California."
1013,sam,Good.
1014,sam,"I have to say, that sounded very professional to me."
1015,sam,Okay.
1016,sam,"To be honest with you, I don’t think I know any state secrets."
1017,sam,I can recite the members of Congress in alphabetical order.
1018,sam,"And I got some patter with the capital gains tax, too."
1019,josh,So they’ll be in position in two hours?
1020,leo,How long before an estimated B.D.A.?
1021,leo,"Excuse me, gentlemen. "
1022,josh,"Leo, do you need me?"
1023,leo,No.
1024,leo,"Mr. President, Morris Tolliver is dead."
1025,bartlet,What time is it?
1026,leo,It’s 10:38 in Damascus.
1027,bartlet,Where is the Syrian ambassador?
1028,leo,He’s at his residence on a secure phone line.
1029,bartlet,Tel Aviv and London?
1030,leo,State’s waiting for your word.
1031,bartlet,"Alright, uh...  I’m gonna call Morris’ wife now. I’ll meet you in the  Situation Room."
1032,leo,"Yes, sir. "
1033,bartlet,Leo?
1034,bartlet,I am not frightened. I’m gonna blow them off the face of the earth with the  fury of God’s own thunder.  Get the commanders.
1036,josh,Huh? 
1038,josh,Donna? 
1040,josh,"""Good morning, Josh"" is a pretty good way to start the day. "
1042,josh,What’s up? 
1044,josh,Tell her I’m in the office. 
1046,josh,What did I do? 
1048,josh,‘Cause you know everything. 
1050,josh,Donna... 
1052,josh,You make plenty of substantive contributions. 
1054,josh,This! This could be a substantive contribution. 
1056,josh,So do I! 
1058,josh,Do-- but I’m not the one who pays you. 
1060,josh,"Donna, she’s looking for me. Do you really think this is the best time to talk  about a raise? "
1062,josh,"Donna, you’re not a very nice person. "
1064,josh,Donna? 
1066,josh,Donna... 
1068,josh,Ok. Here’s what I’m gonna do. 
1070,josh,No. I’m not gonna hide in my office. I’m gonna go into my office and devise a  strategy. That is what I do. I’m a professional. I’m not a little boy. 
1072,josh,"But if she calls, I’m at the dentist. I’ll be back in an hour. "
1074,c.j.,"Wow, are you stupid!"
1075,josh,"You can’t be mad at me about this, C.J."
1076,c.j.,"Really? Let’s see if I can, let’s see if I can find it in me."
1078,c.j.,Could you excuse us Donna?
1080,josh,"I don’t know, but you can kiss that raise goodbye."
1082,josh,Thanks.
1083,c.j.,A call girl?
1084,josh,Here’s the thing...
1085,c.j.,"A call girl, Josh?"
1086,josh,You’re not asking me if I’d like a call girl right now are you?
1087,c.j.,Do you have any idea how serious this is?
1088,josh,"See, the thing is, I really don’t think it is that serious."
1089,c.j.,Really?
1090,josh,"A couple of things for you to bear in mind: he didn’t know she was a call girl when  he went home with her. He didn’t pay her money. He didn’t have knowledge of; witness  or participate in anything illegal. Or for that matter, unethical, immoral or suspect."
1091,c.j.,A couple of things for you to bear in mind: none of that matters on Hard Copy!
1092,josh,You’re overreacting.
1093,c.j.,Am I?
1094,josh,Yes.
1095,c.j.,As women are prone to do?
1096,josh,That’s not what I mean.
1097,c.j.,That’s always what you mean. 
1098,josh,"I really think I’m the best judge of what I mean, you paranoid Berkeley shiksta  feminista!  Whoa. That was way too far."
1099,c.j.,"No, no. Well, I’ve got a staff meeting to go to and so do you, you elitist, Harvard  fascist missed-the-Dean’s-list-two-semesters-in-a-row Yankee jackass!"
1100,josh,"Feel better getting that off your chest there, C.J.?"
1101,c.j.,I’m a whole new woman.
1102,josh,You look like a million bucks by the way.
1103,c.j.,Don’t try to make up with me.
1104,josh,I’ll talk to Sam.
1105,c.j.,I’ll talk to Sam.
1106,josh,Toby.
1107,toby,Hey.
1108,josh,How was last night?
1109,toby,"The longest dinner of my life. The President was up from the table every five  minutes teeing off on Cashman and Berryhill. He’s barking at the Secretary of State,  he’s scaring the hell out of Fitzwallace, which I didn’t think was possible. He’s  snapping at the First Lady. He’s talking about blowing up half of North Africa."
1110,c.j.,He’s snapping at Mrs. Bartlet?
1111,josh,C.J. this might be a good time to tell the President about Sam and the call girl.
1112,toby,She knows?
1113,c.j.,"Yes, I’m afraid I have that information now, and I’ll be in to see you very shortly  my friend."
1114,toby,How the hell did I get into trouble?
1115,josh,"Today, all you had to do was get out of bed."
1116,bartlet,This is crap. It’s been three days. This is amateur hour.
1117,leo,Cashman and Berryhill have to revise the response scenario so that they speak to State...
1118,bartlet,Cashman and Berryhill are dragging their feet. Cashman and Berryhill are trying to make me look like a clown. And State should concern itself with what I damn well tell ‘em to be concerned with!
1119,leo,It doesn’t work like that. 
1120,bartlet,So I’ve discovered.
1121,bartlet,Good morning.
1122,leo,"Moreover you know that’s not the way it works. The Chiefs are working as swiftly as  they can...  ...even  though, frankly, time isn’t a factor."
1123,bartlet,Good morning.
1124,leo,"And not to pile on, but Cashmen and Berryhill have a point with respect to the  Security Council."
1125,bartlet," Uh, Mrs. Landingham, I can’t seem to find my glasses  anywhere. Can you please do whatever it is you do when I can’t find my glasses?"
1126,bartlet,"It’s been 72 hours Leo. That’s more than three days since they blew him out of  the sky. And I’m tired of waiting dammit! This is candy ass! We are going to draw  up a response scenario today, I’m going to give the order today, we’re going to  strike back today."
1127,leo,"I wish you wouldn’t say ‘him’, Mr. President."
1128,bartlet,What?
1129,leo,"‘Three days since they blew him out of the sky.’ Of course that’s fine while it’s  just you and me sir, but in there with Fitzwallace and the Chiefs, I hope you say  ‘it’ or ‘the airplane’ not ‘him’."
1130,bartlet,You think I’m taking this personally.
1131,leo,I think--
1132,bartlet,Why the hell shouldn’t I take this personally?
1133,leo,I think the fact that Morris was on the plane--
1134,bartlet,Americans were on that plane.
1135,leo,Mr. President...
1136,bartlet,"I met Morris four or five times, let’s not do this like he was my son."
1137,leo,"Yes, sir."
1138,bartlet, Mrs. Landingham! 
1139,leo,"Mr. President, I still think we need to talk about... "
1140,bartlet,I can’t fine my glasses anywhere.
1141,bartlet,Thank you.
1142,bartlet, What did you want to say?
1143,leo,Nothing.
1144,bartlet,You sure?
1145,leo,Yeah. I got staff.
1146,bartlet,"All right, I’ll see you in an hour."
1147,leo,Thank you sir. 
1148,leo,Good morning.
1149,josh,Hey.
1150,c.j.,Hey Leo.
1151,josh, How’s his mood?
1152,leo,How’s his mood?
1153,josh,Yeah.
1154,leo,Don’t worry about it.
1155,c.j.,Toby said he’s snapping--
1156,leo,And I said don’t worry about it. 
1157,leo,"Hey Sam, what do you know?"
1158,sam,It’s true.
1159,leo,You’re kidding me.
1160,sam,I’ve got the transcript from the broadcast.
1161,toby,What broadcast?
1162,leo,Listen to this.
1163,sam,Congressman Bertram Coles appearing on a radio program in his home district.
1164,josh,Right.
1165,leo,The fifth.
1166,josh,Yes.
1167,sam,East Chester County part of Lofton.
1168,leo,Who we just recommended cuts in funding for the M6 Beacon.
1169,toby,What’d he say?
1170,sam,"He was on the broadcast along with several officers from Cromwell Air Force Base  when he said regarding the President being weak on defense: ""Folks down here are  patriotic, fiercely patriotic. The President better not be planning on making any  visits to this base. If he does, he may not get out alive."""
1171,toby,He said that?
1172,leo,You believe it?
1173,toby,Sitting with military officers.
1174,josh,Don’t take the bait.
1175,toby,Josh.
1176,josh,Don’t take the bait.
1177,toby,You better believe I’m going to take the bait.
1178,josh,Toby.
1179,leo,There oughta be a law against it.
1180,toby,There is a law against it.
1181,josh,Why’d you get him started? 
1182,toby,"How about threatening the life of the President? He was talking to other people,  how about conspiracy? Those were military officers, how about treason?!"
1183,josh,Toby.
1184,toby,That was a member of our own party Leo. That was a   Democrat who said that!
1185,leo,"It’s bad, I know."
1186,toby,That’s it?
1187,leo,"Well, what are you gonna do?"
1188,toby,Have the Justice Department bring him in for questioning pending felony charges.
1189,josh,Toby’s right. What’s the good of being in power if you’re not gonna haul your  enemies in for questioning?
1190,toby,We’re really not gonna do anything about this?
1191,leo,"Yeah Toby, because what we really need to do is arrest people for being mean to  the President."
1192,toby,There is no law. There is no decency.
1193,josh,He’s just getting that now.
1194,leo," In the event an attack order is given today we’ll need a half hour  on the networks. Uh, when do they need to be told?"
1195,c.j.,90 minutes.
1196,leo,"Wait till the last minute. Toby, start working on a draft for the President."
1197,toby,I need to know what we’re hitting.
1198,leo,"Yeah, you and me both."
1199,toby,Leo.
1200,leo,It’s military Toby. You’ll know when you know.
1201,toby,"Sam, work with the coordinating State department guy."
1202,sam,Beech.
1203,toby,And whoever the spokesperson is.
1204,sam,Hutchinson.
1205,leo,Let’s do this right.
1206,josh,Not much chance of that.
1207,c.j.,We need to be fully stocked. State Department officials. Pentagon. We’ll need the Embassy Office-
1208,josh,We should get McMartin on board.
1209,c.j.,He’s standing by.
1210,josh,And Adamley at the Pentagon.
1211,c.j.,We got him.
1212,josh,"So we’re all set, good. So how do we tell them what we know without telling them what we know?"
1213,c.j.,"Well we don’t know anything so that shouldn’t be hard. Oh, Samuel, could you stop  by my office around lunchtime please?"
1214,sam,Sure. 
1215,sam,Think she knows?
1216,toby, Yeah.
1217,sam,Why?
1218,toby,Cause she told me she knows.
1219,sam,Could we talk for a moment?
1220,toby,"Yeah, my office. I’ll be right back."
1221,toby,Hold on. Stay there. 
1222,toby,Yeah?
1223,toby,Yeah.
1224,toby,The Secret Service investigates all threats made against the President. It’s White  House policy not to comment on those investigations.
1225,toby," Damn, I gotta  get back to my office."
1226,c.j.,I think the thing to say is that we don’t think anyone here would be disappointed  if no one paid attention to the process.
1227,c.j.,Science and technology.  We’re done here.
1228,sam,Hi.
1229,c.j.,Hi.
1230,sam,You wanted to see me. And I think I know what it’s about.
1231,c.j.,"Really? You sussed it out, huh?  Let me tell you something  Sam, you’re a smart guy. But if you can figure it out, and I can figure it out,  what makes you think that no one in my Press Room can figure it out?"
1232,sam,There’s nothing to figure out.
1233,c.j.,"You can’t spend time with a call girl, you’re gonna get caught."
1234,sam,Caught doing what?
1235,c.j.,Don’t get cute with me.
1236,sam,"You are aware that I didn’t know she was a call girl when I went home with her,  right?"
1237,c.j.,But you called her again and went back to see her.
1238,sam,"I went back to see her, I didn’t go back to solicit her."
1239,c.j.,It doesn’t make a difference.
1240,sam,It does make a difference.
1241,c.j.,"You work in the White House, you work fifty feet from the Oval Office. And you’re  consorting with a..."
1242,sam,"Consorting? I’m friendly with a woman, I like this woman. This woman poses no threat  to the President. And it’s very likely that owing to my friendship, this woman may  start living her life in bound, insuring for herself a greater future and isn’t that  exactly what we’re supposed to be doing here?"
1243,c.j.,Oh.
1244,c.j.,You’re there to make her see the error of her ways.
1245,sam,"This is ridiculous. I’m there because I like her. I’m there because it’s there that  I’d be if this were alcohol or drugs. I’m not sleeping with her, this isn’t tawdry."
1246,c.j.,"I don’t care what it is, I care what it looks like."
1247,sam,"And I care what it is! And I think it’s high time we all spend a little less time  looking good, and a little more time..."
1248,c.j.,Being good?
1249,sam,Yes.
1250,c.j.,"Yeah, I’ve heard that one before. And one other thing."
1251,sam,Are we done?
1252,c.j.,"No, Sam, when I say there’s ‘one other thing’ that means we’re not done, that  there’s one other thing."
1253,sam,I’m resenting the hell out of this conversation.
1254,c.j.,It was tough to tell from your tone of voice.
1255,sam,What do you want?
1256,c.j.,I beg your pardon?
1257,sam,What’s the one other thing?
1258,c.j.,I’m your first phone call.
1259,sam,When?
1260,c.j.,"Before, now, in the future, anytime you’re into something and you don’t know what.  And you can’t tell me that you thought there was nothing to it, because you sat down  with Josh and you sat down with Toby. Anytime you’re into something and you don’t  know what, you don’t keep it from me. I’m your first phone call. I’m your first line  of defense. You have to let me protect you and you have to let me protect the President."
1261,sam,Is that what this is about?
1262,c.j.," What this is about Sam is you’re a high profile, very visible, much noticed  member..."
1263,sam,You just said three things that all mean the same thing.
1264,c.j.,You’re not going to let this out of your teeth.
1265,sam,Can I go now C.J.? Because what I think this is about is you. Once again letting the  character cops win in a forfeit because you don’t have the guts or the strength or the  courage to say ‘we know what’s right from wrong and this none of your damn business!’
1266,c.j., Really?
1267,sam,Yes!
1268,c.j.,"Strength, guts or courage?"
1269,sam,Yes.
1270,c.j.,You just said three things that all mean the same thing. 
1271,c.j.,We’re done talking now. You can go. 
1272,sam," About the  retaliatory strike, do you think we’re going to target--?"
1273,c.j.,I really don’t know what we’re going to target Sam. The commandant of the 2nd  division doesn’t tend to include me in his thinking.
1274,sam,I’ll see you later.
1275,c.j.,Count on it.
1276,bartlet,Keep your seats. 
1277,bartlet,What have we got?
1278,leo,When are they operational?
1279,leo,No prep time?
1280,bartlet,What is the virtue of a proportional response?
1281,bartlet,"What’s the virtue of a proportional response? Why’s it good?  They hit an  airplane, so we hit a transmitter, right? That’s a proportional response."
1282,bartlet,"They hit a barracks, so we hit two transmitters?"
1283,bartlet,It’s what we do. I mean this is what we do.
1284,leo,"Yes sir, it’s what we do, it’s what we’ve always done."
1285,bartlet,"Well, if it’s what we do, if it’s what we’ve always done, don’t they know we’re  going to do it?"
1286,leo,"Sir, if you would turn your attention to Pericles One."
1287,bartlet,"I have turned my attention to Pericles One, it’s two ammo dumps, an abandoned  railroad bridge and a Syrian intelligence agency."
1288,bartlet,"But they know we’re going to do that, they know we’re going to do that. Those areas  have been abandoned for four days. We know that from the satellites. We have the  intelligence."
1289,leo,Sir.
1290,bartlet,"They did that, so we did this, it’s the cost of doing business, it’s been factored  in, right?"
1291,leo,Mr. President...
1292,bartlet,Am I right or am I missing something here?
1293,bartlet,"Then I ask again, what is the virtue of a proportional response?"
1294,bartlet,It is not all there is.
1295,leo,"Sir, Admiral Fitzwallace..."
1296,bartlet,"A disproportional response. Let the word ring forth from this time and this place,  you kill an American, any American, we don’t come back with a proportional response,  we come back  with total disaster!"
1297,bartlet,"General, I am suggesting that you and Admiral Fitzwallace and Secretary Hutchinson  and the rest of the national security team take the next sixty minutes and put  together a U.S. response scenario that doesn’t make me think we are just docking  somebody’s damn allowance! "
1298,josh,"I would like a salad. I would like a soup of some kind and if you were to run across a sandwich, then hang the expense."
1300,josh,And I would like a bottle of water.
1302,josh,I’m supposed to vet you.
1303,josh,"I’m supposed to vet you, vet you; investigate to discover... if there are problems.  I’m Josh Lyman, deputy chief of staff."
1304,josh,Is it Charles?
1305,josh,"Charlie, you can have a seat if you like."
1306,josh,"Uh, Donna!"
1308,josh,"Never mind the salad, I’m not going to eat it anyway."
1310,josh,But I would like a bottle of water as soon as humanly possible.
1312,josh,"So... have a seat.  I’m sure you understand why we have to go through  this. It’s a very sensitive job. It’s also a very hard job. Twenty-hour days aren’t  uncommon, long trips at the last minute, a lot of wait and hurry up. Moreover there  will be times when you’ll have to make yourself invisible in plain sight, as well as  an undeniable force in front of those who want more time than we’re willing to give.  Sometimes the people I’m talking about will be kings and prime ministers, you  understand so far? "
1313,josh,Really?
1314,josh,"Yeah, I have your paperwork."
1315,josh,Yes.
1316,josh,"Yes, that’s because we asked Miss DiLaguardia to keep an eye out. She’s recommending  you for a different job."
1317,josh,"Personal aide to the President, and you don’t have to call me ‘Sir’."
1318,josh,"Personal aide to the President, traditionally a young guy, 20 to 25 years old,  excels academically, strong in personal responsibility and discretion, presentable  appearance."
1319,josh,"We obviously get a lot of candidates that meet those qualifications, the rest is  just gut instinct.  Or you could bribe me."
1320,josh,"Seriously Charlie, we call the President ‘Sir’ everyone else is ‘hey, when am I  gonna get that thing I asked for?’"
1322,josh,‘Insuccessful’?
1324,josh,I don’t think we’re allowed to make up our own words.
1326,josh,"Change it, would you? Serious people are going to read that. "
1327,josh,"Charlie, you’re standing again."
1328,josh,Why aren’t you in college?
1329,josh,These transcripts. Your grades are better than mine.
1330,josh,"Well, no, not really, but they’re close."
1331,josh,"No, come one, I’m looking at recommendations from guidance counselors, I’m looking  at ACT scores. You didn’t want to go to college?"
1332,josh,You take care of her?
1333,josh,Your parents are gone?
1334,bartlet,"Keep your seats. There’s a delegation of cardiologists having their pictures taken  in the Blue Room. You wouldn’t think you could find a group of people more arrogant  than the fifteen of us, but there they are right upstairs in the Blue Room. You  called me?"
1335,bartlet, Does anyone have a cigarette?
1336,bartlet,Pericles One. No civilian causalities?
1337,bartlet,But you’re as certain as you can be?
1338,bartlet,And what are the military implications?
1339,bartlet,Very well.  How does this work?
1340,bartlet,Fifty buck crime. 
1341,josh,"Charlie, I’ve got some questions here for you from the Council’s office, as well as  the Department of the Treasury and the Office of Internal Security. These questions  are all routine, there’s no cause for concern. Ready?"
1342,josh,‘Have you ever tried to overthrow the government?’
1343,josh,"Charlie, this job’s actually better than the messenger job. It pays more, you don’t  have to ride around town on a bicycle and instead of being a messenger, you get to  be personal aide to the President."
1344,josh,"Hey, Sam. This is Sam Seaborn, he’s deputy communications director. This is Charlie  Young. He’s here for Ted’s job."
1345,sam,"It’s nice to meet you, don’t get up."
1346,sam,Debbie’s got an eye for personnel.
1347,josh,I gotta ask you some more questions...
1348,sam,Have you ever tried to overthrow the government?
1349,sam,What the hell’s been stopping you? 
1350,josh,"Seriously Charlie, I have to ask you about your personal life."
1351,sam,"No, you don’t."
1352,josh,"Yes, I do."
1353,sam,Why?
1354,josh,Because I do.
1355,sam,"Charlie, are you gonna come to work early, stay late, do your job efficiently and  discretely?"
1356,sam,Thank you. What more do you need to know?
1357,josh,"Charlie, I wonder if you could tell me about your social life, your friends, what  you like to do?"
1358,sam,"Josh, I cannot believe you."
1359,sam,"He’s asking if you’re gay, Charlie, and I wouldn’t answer the damn question."
1360,josh,"All right, that’s it Sam, let’s take a walk. "
1361,sam,"You know what, feel free to sue our asses off. I’ll represent you."
1362,josh,Let’s go.
1363,josh,What the hell was that about?
1364,sam,This is ridiculous.
1365,josh,It’s not all that ridiculous.
1366,sam,I know the difference between right and wrong.
1367,josh,It’s not like you didn’t know you’d be held to a high standard when you took this job.
1368,sam,"I don’t mind being held to a higher standard, I mind being held to a lower one."
1369,josh,"I gotta say Sam, digging your heels in..."
1370,sam,I was just talking.
1371,josh,I understand...
1372,sam,‘Digging my heels in’? Another word for that would be principle?
1373,josh,I’m just saying!
1374,toby,Leo’s office.
1375,toby,It’s happening.
1376,sam,It’s happening?
1377,c.j.,"Yeah, that’s what I hear."
1378,leo," The order was given at 16:27, codename Pericles One. Four targets, all  military. Two munitions dumps in Northern Rishan, Southian bridge and an IHQ."
1379,c.j.,What’s the estimated time?
1380,leo,"About 6:30 Eastern, you can come to the Sit Room in twenty minutes for a weapons  briefing. In the meantime, Toby, Sam, the President will go on network at nine, so  start zeroing in.  Hey guys, no phone calls in  or out. C.J., nothing to the press until you get the high sign from me. No head starts."
1381,c.j.,They’re gonna wonder what all the fuss is about.
1382,leo,Then let’s not have any fuss.
1383,c.j.,I could use a few minutes with the President at some point.
1384,leo,You and me both.
1385,c.j.,"I’m not kidding Leo, this is the..."
1386,leo,You’ll be there.
1387,c.j.,This is the first...
1388,leo,You’ll be there.
1389,c.j.,He’ll talk to me?
1390,leo,Yes.
1391,josh,How you doing?
1392,leo,Fine.
1393,josh,"Leo, Toby says he’s snapping at the First..."
1394,leo,"Not now Josh. I mean, you’re right, but not now.  Margaret!"
1395,josh,"Hey Leo, can I ask you a question?"
1396,leo,What?
1397,josh,"I’m interviewing this kid for Ted Miller’s job, and he’s a real special kid. He’s applied himself in school, I’m sure he’d be articulate if he wasn’t terrified. He’s  postponing college until his sister gets out of high school."
1398,leo,Where are the parents?
1399,josh,Father’s long gone. His mother was a uniformed cop here in D.C.
1400,leo,Was?
1401,josh,She was shot and killed in the line five months ago.  I really like him Leo.  I want to hire him.
1402,leo,What’s the problem?
1403,josh,He’s black.
1404,leo,So’s the Attorney General and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs?
1405,josh,They don’t hold the door open for the President.
1406,leo,What are you worried...?
1407,josh,I’m not wild about the visual. A young black man holding his overnight bag?
1408,leo,"Josh, I hold the door open for the President, it’s an honor. This is serious business  Josh. This isn’t casting. We get the guy for the job and we take it from there."
1409,josh,Good.
1410,leo,And I’m fairly sure I’m right about this.
1411,josh,Yeah. Good.  Two hours?
1412,leo,"Uh, a little less."
1413,leo,Send him in.
1414,josh,We’ll be fine.
1415,leo,Yeah.
1416,josh,How are you Admiral?  Josh Lyman.
1417,josh,Tough day.
1418,josh,Good. 
1419,leo,I know.
1420,leo,Any advice?
1421,leo,"Yeah, it is."
1422,leo,He’s not doing fine.
1423,leo,"Yeah.  Uh, hey Fitz?"
1424,leo,"The President’s personal aide, they’re looking at a kid. Do you have any problem  with a young black man waiting on the President? "
1425,leo,The kid’s gotta carry his bags...
1426,leo,Yeah.
1427,leo,Yeah.
1428,leo,That’s what I thought.
1429,leo,Thanks Admiral. Good luck.
1430,toby,Evening sir. Sorry I can’t stop...
1431,toby,"It’s my first bombing, I don’t know yet. "
1432,josh,"Toby, you need help with anything because..."
1433,toby,No! 
1434,josh,"Sheila, if you need me for anything... Standing here with absolutely nothing to do."
1435,c.j.,"I don’t know, they’re planning my surprise party."
1436,sam,Unprovoked and cold-blooded.
1437,toby,It’s needs a third.
1438,c.j.,Toby?
1439,toby,Quickly.
1440,c.j.,The AGM 84 Islam.
1441,toby,Cathy! Sam cut the paragraph ten minutes ago.
1442,c.j.,The 84 Islam?
1443,toby,"Standoff land attack missile. Distinguish it from the AGM 84D or Harpoon, which is  an anti-shive missile."
1444,c.j.,Thank you. 
1445,toby,The third thing?
1446,sam,"Unwarranted, unprovoked..."
1447,toby,And cold-blooded. Unwarranted.
1448,sam,Unprovoked.
1449,toby,And cold-blooded. Great.
1450,sam, I just need a...
1451,toby,Where you going?
1452,sam,"Two seconds. Just two seconds.  C.J., listen."
1453,c.j.,What?
1454,sam,I’m sorry about before.
1455,c.j.,Yeah.
1456,sam,I’m just really very fond of her is all.
1457,c.j.,Go back to work.
1458,sam,Right.
1459,c.j.,What activity?
1460,c.j.," Admiral Fitzwallace is Chairman of the  Joint Chiefs, Leo McGarry is White House chief of staff, I’m your host C.J., let’s  play our game."
1461,c.j.,No.
1462,c.j.,Guys.
1463,c.j.,Menudo’s in the building. I gotta go.
1464,c.j.,Oh man. I’d honestly think that you of all people.
1465,c.j.,"Danny, I haven’t called a full lid, they’ll obviously be a briefing if the President  has engaged the use of military force."
1466,c.j., What?
1467,c.j.,Inside.
1468,josh,Where’s Charlie?
1470,josh,How’s he doing?
1472,josh,He’s a gamer. I can pick ‘em.
1474,josh,I’ve got nothing to do.
1476,josh,"Woo! Excuse me. Everyone’s running around like the future of the world depends on it,  which I suppose it does, everyone running around, working. Me, I’ve got nothing to do."
1478,josh,I’m like a writer on a movie set.
1480,josh,"No, but I hear stories."
1482,josh, I suppose there’s some comfort in knowing that whatever’s going to  happen today has already happened.
1483,josh,I don’t understand it. Why can’t you tell me when there’s someone in my office?
1485,josh, Why are you here?
1486,josh,You picked a really bad time to get psyched.
1487,josh,"No, it’s because--"
1488,josh,"You wanna say it a bit louder Mandy, I don’t Syrian Air Defense Command heard you."
1489,josh,Why are you being nice to me? 
1490,josh,It’s been pretty bad around here since it happened.
1491,josh,"The combination of American lives and Morris, the idea of using any force at all."
1492,josh,He wasn’t ready for it.
1493,josh,What did you bring me?
1494,josh,I want my present.
1495,josh,It’s a picture of you and me and someone’s drawn all over my face with magic marker.
1496,josh,Ah.
1497,josh,"Well, that could have been pretty much any time, couldn’t it?"
1498,josh,Look at that.
1499,josh,"Well, you were wearing quite the ensemble that night Madeline."
1500,josh,Yeah... yeah.  They found a job for me.
1501,josh,"Listen, you’re not gonna be this nice to me when we’re working together, right?"
1502,josh,That’s what I thought.  Hey. What’s up?
1503,c.j.,"Danny, it’s gonna be much ado about nothing."
1504,c.j.,But it is that way and I just got through telling you it’s that way.
1505,c.j.,"Sam knows the difference between right and wrong and so do you. Would it make my  life easier if he wasn’t friends with this woman? Absolutely. But Sam is a grown up  and I don’t get to choose his friends and your readers don’t get to judge them. And  I’ll tell you what else, there’s something commendable about Sam’s behavior here,  don’t ask me what but there is, and I’m stickin’ by him until the President orders  me otherwise and I’m going to look very unfavorably on those who seek only to make  us look like fools."
1506,c.j.,Good.
1507,c.j.,Thank you.
1508,c.j.,I don’t supposed you’d tell me...
1509,c.j.,"Yeah. I’ll wait for him.  Hang on, I’m gonna give you a ten minute head  start on something."
1510,c.j.,For being a good guy.
1511,c.j., We’re out of Syrian air space.
1512,josh,This used to be the White House Council’s office ‘til Toby and the Communications  staff conquered and pillaged. The Map Room. Roosevelt Room. Oval Office. Chief of  Staff. I guess the only thing left to do is to say hello to the President.
1513,josh,We’re going on the air in a few minutes with a national address so I don’t know how  much... where the hell’d he go?  Charlie.
1514,bartlet,What happened to paragraph nine?
1515,sam,In the red line sir.
1516,bartlet,"I’m sorry, paragraph eight."
1517,sam,We cut that half an hour ago.
1518,toby,You have to read between the lines.
1519,bartlet,"Well, I want to see it again."
1520,toby,You should look at the new paragraph.
1521,bartlet,I can’t look at anything fellas. Mrs. Landingham! I need my glasses!
1522,toby,Mr. President.
1523,bartlet,When do we get the BDA?
1524,toby,Uh.
1525,sam,There’s a problem with that sir.
1526,bartlet,Why!?
1527,toby,Ordinarily we get help from inside the Syrian Intelligence.
1528,bartlet,So what’s the problem?
1529,toby,We just blew up the Syrian Intelligence.
1530,bartlet,"Oh, for crying out loud, will somebody get on the phone to CNN and find out if we  hit anything!"
1531,bartlet,Thank you! Now if I had my glasses.
1532,bartlet,"This has been since this morning, we could have brought in an optometrist by now."
1533,bartlet,"I don’t need an optometrist now, thank you Nancy. I just need to glasses he  prescribed."
1534,c.j.," Mr. President, if you’ll take a minute or two to familiarize yourself with  the phoenix."
1535,bartlet,I got the briefing on the phoenix.
1536,c.j.,You understand that I’m not talking about the sidewinder.
1537,bartlet,"The phoenix. I got the briefing on the phoenix last night, I studied the report,  Hutchinson was there, in my private study. "
1538,c.j.,"Yes, sir."
1539,bartlet,Very well.
1540,josh,Tell him.
1541,bartlet,For want of a pair of glasses.
1542,c.j.,Try mine sir.
1543,bartlet,Thank you. 
1544,toby,"While they’re looking sir, in the meantime can you take a look at the new paragraph?"
1545,bartlet,"Aw, crap. I can’t see anything with those."
1546,josh,"Charlie, tell him."
1547,bartlet,What!?
1548,bartlet,What of it? Who is this?
1549,josh,"Mr. President, this is Charles Young..."
1550,bartlet,I don’t have anytime for new people now!
1551,leo,"Alright, that’s it.  Excuse me, Mr. President, a minute please."
1552,bartlet,"What do you need, Leo?"
1553,leo,"Well, you’ve gone through everyone who works for you and everyone who’s married to  you. I didn’t know who else you could get mad at, so I was afraid the American  people might be next. Oh, by the way, when we’re done here you’re sending Abby  some flowers."
1554,bartlet," Did you know that two thousand years ago a Roman citizen could walk across  the face of the known world free of the fear of molestation? He could walk across  the earth unharmed, cloaked only in the words ‘Civis Romanis’ I am a Roman citizen.  So great was the retribution of Rome, universally understood as certain, should any  harm befall even one of its citizens. Where was Morris’ protection, or anyone else  on that plane? Where is the retribution for the families and where is the warning to  the rest of the world that Americans shall walk this earth unharmed, lest the  clenched fist of the most mighty military force in the history of mankind comes  crashing down on your house!? In other words, Leo, what the hell are we doing here?"
1555,leo,We are behaving the way a superpower ought to behave.
1556,bartlet,"Well our behavior has produced some pretty crappy results. In fact, I’m not a  hundred percent sure it hasn’t induced them."
1557,leo,What are you talking about?
1558,bartlet,"I’m talking about two hundred and eight-six American marines in Beirut, I’m talking  about Somalia, I’m talking about Nairobi."
1559,leo,And you think ratching up the body count’s gonna act as a deterrent?
1560,bartlet,You’re damn right.
1561,leo,"Then you are just as dumb as these guys who think that capital punishment is going  to be a deterrent for drug kingpins. As if drug kingpins didn’t live their day to  day lives under the possibility of execution. And their executions are a lot less  dainty than ours and tend to take place without the bother and expense of due  process. So my friend, if you want to start using American military strength as the  arm of the Lord, you can do that, we’re the only superpower left. You can conquer  the world, like Charlemenge, but you better be prepared to kill everyone and you  better start with me cause I will raise up an army against you and I will beat you!"
1562,bartlet,He had a ten-day-old baby at home.
1563,leo,I know.
1564,bartlet,We are doing nothing. They dest...
1565,leo,We are not doing nothing. Four high rated military targets.
1566,bartlet,And this is good?
1567,leo,"Of course it’s not good, there is no good. It’s what there is. It’s how you behave  if you’re the most powerful nation in the world. It’s proportional, it’s reasonable,  it’s responsible, it’s merciful. It’s not nothing, four high rated military targets."
1568,bartlet,Which they’ll rebuild again in six months.
1569,leo,So we’ll blow ‘em up again in six months! We’re getting really good at it.  It’s what our fathers taught us.
1570,bartlet,Why didn’t you say so?  When I think of all the work you did to get me elected.  I could pommel your ass with a baseball bat. 
1571,leo,"Oh, here’s one you’ll like. Bertram Coles--"
1572,bartlet,"Oh, I like anything that starts with ‘Bertram Coles’. Let’s have it."
1573,leo,Coles goes on the radio yesterday and he says people in his district love America  and you better not come down there cause you might not get out alive. 
1574,bartlet,Bert’s calling me out?
1575,leo,"Apparently, the people in Bert’s district are so patriotic that if the President  of the United States himself were to show up, they’d kill him."
1576,bartlet,Ziegler must be ballistic.
1577,leo,Toby is on it.
1578,bartlet,"Oh, by the way, who was that kid before? The one who figured out where my glasses are?"
1579,leo,"Well, if you want him, that’s your new body man."
1580,bartlet,What’s his story?
1581,josh,"This was just, I think, a bad day. I have to tell you, he’s ordinarily an extremely  kind man placing a very high premium on civility. Today, it’s just been a difficult  few days for him."
1582,bartlet," Excuse me Charlie. Can I see you inside please? Come on,  it’s okay. "
1583,bartlet,"But you prefer Charlie, right? Listen, Leo McGarry filled me in on the situation  with your mother, I’m so very sorry. I hope you don’t mind but I took the liberty  of calling Tom Connolly, the FBI Director. We had the computer spit out some quick  information, you’re mother was killed by a Western .38 Revolver firing K.T.W.s, or  what are known as ‘Cop Killer bullets’, now we have not had a whole lot of success  banning that weapon and those bullets off the streets, but we’re planning on taking  a big whack at it when Congress gets back from recess. So, what do you say, you  wanna come help us out?"
1584,bartlet,Thanks.
1585,leo,All set?
1586,bartlet,You tell me.
1587,leo,That’s a pretty ugly tie.
1588,bartlet,My granddaughter gave me this tie.
1589,leo,"So, my nephew gave me an ashtray he made at summer camp."
1590,bartlet,Get away from me. Somebody throw this guy out of the building!
1591,josh,It doesn’t go away.
1592,bartlet,"My fellow Americans, good evening. A short while ago I ordered our Armed Forces to  attack and destroy four military targets in Northern Syria, this in response to the  unwarranted, unprovoked..."
1593,bartlet,"One night he went in and set the briefcase down and said, “Bess, why do you suppose  it is that only sons-of-bitches know how to lick a stamp?”  The point is, friends, you’ve got to write the letter, you’ve got to send a fax,  you’ve got to pick up the phone and call Western Union. You’ve got to contact your  Congressional representative..."
1594,bartlet,"You’ve got to say “Mister, I’ve got a friend who’s neighbor is dead..."
1595,leo,McGarry here.
1596,bartlet,"“...Madam, I’ve got a neighbor whose friend is dead, whose husband is dead, whose  mother is dead, kids are dead! Kids are dead!"
1597,leo,What are you talking about?
1598,bartlet,"“...and I wanna know, mister. I wanna know, madam..."
1599,leo,How did it happen?
1600,bartlet,"...how you intend to vote on Wednesday, so that I’ll know how to vote next election...”"
1601,leo,Well how did the wheels come off this thing?
1602,bartlet,You gotta ask ‘em. You gotta ask ‘em! 
1603,leo,We lost five votes.
1604,josh,What?
1605,leo,We lost five votes.
1606,josh,Give me names.
1607,leo,I don’t got them yet. Get on the phone.
1608,josh,"Oh, man!"
1609,bartlet,"You know, I had a civil procedure professor who said once..."
1610,toby,Take a beat.  There you go.
1611,bartlet,"He said, “When the law is on your side, argue the law; and when the facts are on  your side, argue the facts..."
1612,leo,But it’s not in cement.
1613,bartlet,"...When you don’t have the law on your side, when you don’t have the facts on your  side, bang your fist on the defense table as loud as you can.” Well, we’ve got the  law on our side now, and we’ve got the facts on our side now..."
1614,josh,"Yeah, this is Josh Lyman. Please call me. I need to know what happened."
1615,bartlet,"...bang our fist on the defense table, but we’re not listening any more. We’re not  having that any more. We’re gonna win on Wednesday. We’re gonna win on Wednesday!  Thank you all.  God bless you, and God bless America!"
1616,sam,Fantastic.
1617,bartlet,Thank you.
1618,sam,Good job.
1619,toby, Yeah.
1620,sam,You didn’t like it.
1621,toby,I thought it was fine.
1622,sam,I thought it was a hell of a lot better than fine. 
1623,toby, It was good.
1624,sam,It was outstanding!
1625,toby,He blew the D section.
1626,sam,"Toby, they’re still on their feet cheering."
1627,toby,"Yeah, I said it was fine."
1628,c.j.," Sam, nice going."
1629,sam,Thank you. Tell him. 
1630,c.j.,Why?
1631,sam,Well-
1632,toby,Because Sam wrote two and a half paragraphs and I wrote thirty-seven pages.
1633,c.j.,Still...
1634,toby,He blew the D section.
1635,c.j.,I thought it was inspired.
1636,toby,Why do you keep saying stuff like that to me?
1637,josh, C.J.!
1638,c.j.," Hey, your little fan club was out in full force tonight."
1639,josh,"Well, they like me in my tux."
1640,c.j.,Do you think I have an unusually large neck?
1641,josh,What the hell?
1642,c.j.,"I’m just asking, ‘cause one of the..."
1643,josh,Stop talking.
1644,c.j.,What’s up?
1645,josh,I want you to look calm while I’m telling you this. 
1646,c.j.,Telling me what?
1647,josh,We lost five.
1648,c.j.,What do you mean?
1649,josh,802. Five votes jumped the fence.
1650,c.j., Are you kidding me?
1651,josh,Nice job looking calm.
1652,c.j.,Are you kidding me?
1653,josh,"Leo just got off the phone with the whip. Last nose count, we’re five votes down."
1654,c.j.,What the hell happened?
1655,josh,We don’t know.
1656,c.j.,Give me names.
1657,josh,We’re finding out.
1658,leo, Josh.
1659,josh,Yeah?
1660,sam, Hi there.
1661,sam,“Happy Days Are Here Again”?
1662,sam,Who?
1663,sam,We try and avoid having the President make aesthetic decisions.
1664,sam,"Right. And I don’t mean to step on your toes, but you might want to rethink marrying the lines “Kids are dead. Kids are dead!” and “Happy Days Are Here Again.”"
1665,sam,I’ll say.
1666,bartlet,Thank you. Good night.  Toby!
1667,toby,Sir.
1668,bartlet,What’d you think?
1669,toby,"I thought my work was outstanding, Mr. President. "
1670,bartlet,I thought you would.
1671,toby,Thanks for asking.  Couldn’t help but notice you got a little extemporaneous  there in the D section. 
1672,bartlet,"Oh, you noticed that, did you?"
1673,toby,"Yes sir, I did."
1674,bartlet,Yes. I did a little polish right up there on my feet.
1675,toby,Yes indeed.
1676,bartlet,"Right in front of everybody. I looked to the side at one point, you know. I half  expected to see you coming at me with a salad fork."
1677,toby,"Well, but for the secret service agents restraining me, sir."
1678,bartlet,Yup. Thank God for the secret service.
1679,toby,Bless their hearts...
1680,bartlet," Hey there, fella. She deserves a nice  room and some supper."
1681,toby,"You like doing that, don’t you sir?"
1682,bartlet," Hey, Charlie!"
1683,bartlet,What’d you think of the speech?
1684,bartlet,"Yes, you."
1685,toby,"He means the text of the speech, Charlie, discounting the little improv in the  D section."
1686,bartlet,"I mean the entire speech, Charlie, and in particular the delivery."
1687,bartlet,"See, I think what Charlie’s trying to say is that in this case the singer  outdistanced the song."
1688,toby,"Really. Well, what I heard Charlie say was that the text was user-proof, although  you did your level best to disprove that in the D section."
1689,bartlet,"You know what, Toby?"
1690,toby,Sir.
1691,bartlet,You’re what my mother calls a pain in the ass.
1692,toby,"Well, that’s what my mother calls it too, sir."
1693,bartlet,"Yes, Charlie. By the way, did the First Lady call? "
1694,bartlet,My back is fine.
1695,bartlet,Those damn things make me goofy.
1696,bartlet,"You don’t have to describe her tone to me, Charlie. I’ve been married to it for  32 years."
1697,bartlet,"Give me the medicine, Charlie.  Thank you. Have a good night. I’ll see you in the morning."
1698,bartlet, Thank you all.
1699,josh,Thanks!
1700,c.j., It helps not to know him!
1701,c.j.,"Leo, your food’s getting cold. Want me to bring it over? "
1702,josh, Isn’t my food getting cold too? 
1703,c.j.,We ate your food.
1704,c.j.,Oh thanks. Try some of this.
1705,toby, Here it comes.
1706,c.j.,"Yum! Oh, Sam, you gotta try the General Chow’s chicken."
1707,c.j.,With the sauce. 
1708,sam, That’s delicious!
1709,c.j.,You didn’t try it with the sauce.
1710,toby,Will the two of you... shut up?
1711,toby,I’m really very happy with the food that I’ve got.
1712,c.j.,Botrell?
1713,leo,"It’s not Botrell. I’ve only got two, but Botrell isn’t one of them. Katzenmoyer  and Wick."
1714,leo,"Sam, slide me a soda please."
1715,josh,Everyone’s someplace else. All I got was O’Bannon. 
1716,leo,I didn’t get O’Bannon. That’s three.
1717,josh,Who’d you get?
1718,sam,Katzenmoyer and Christopher Wick.
1719,josh,Chris Wick?
1720,leo,Yeah.
1721,josh,It’s got to be a mistake. Who told you that?
1722,leo,Lee Tamaki and the minority whip.
1723,josh,They’ve got bad information. There is no way Chris Wick jumped the fence.
1724,leo,The President just told a ballroom full of people and anyone who reads a newspaper  that we’re gonna pass 802 on Wednesday. We’ve got a 72 hour fight.
1725,toby,How do we do that without making noise?
1726,leo,There’s two things in the world you never want to let people see how you make ‘em:  laws and sausages.
1727,leo,"Absolutely. This is us.  C.J., what’s the press room going to be talking  about in the next few days?"
1728,c.j.,Financial disclosures.
1729,toby,That time again?
1730,c.j.,It’s that time again.
1731,josh,"What are you worth there, Toby?"
1732,toby," Well, I own this tuxedo, and I’ve got twenty-three bucks in my pocket."
1733,leo,Financial disclosure it is.
1734,josh,She’s right.
1735,toby,"It’s a pretty humiliating way of taking one for the team, isn’t it?"
1736,toby,I found that. I found that women especially can’t get enough of my 1993 Dodge Dart.
1737,leo,How do we get the votes?
1738,sam,"Well, setting aside Christopher Wick, and I agree with Josh. Someone’s getting that  wrong. Katzenmoyer and O’Bannon I buy. I’m going to guess the other two are  Tillinghouse and LeBrandt. That’s what we’re going to hear tomorrow. Now the two of  them are going to vote together on this, so we’re really only going to need to get  to one, and whether it’s Tillinghouse or LeBrandt, and it should be Tillinghouse,  we’re gonna need help."
1739,josh,Yeah.
1740,leo,Who?
1741,sam,You’re not going to like it.
1742,leo,Who?
1743,sam,The Vice President.
1744,leo,No way.
1745,josh,Leo...
1746,leo,No way.
1747,josh,Tillinghouse and the Vice...
1748,leo,I’m not using Hoynes.
1749,leo, What time do you have? My watch says two o’clock?
1750,sam, It’s two o’clock.
1751,leo,Did someone pay for this?
1752,leo,"Make sure you turn in a receipt. I gotta go home.  Toby, Sam, beautiful work. "
1753,sam,Thank you.
1754,toby, Thirty-seven pages.
1755,leo,What do you mean?
1756,leo,"I’m really sorry, Jenny."
1757,leo,We’re five votes short on 802.
1758,leo,"I can do things, Jenny. I wake people up. I meet with key staff. It’s a long..."
1759,leo,"Yeah, I’ll be right up.   What’s this?"
1760,leo,For me?
1761,leo,From you?
1762,leo,For what?
1763,toby,I honestly couldn’t say.
1764,toby,Yes.
1765,toby,And I’m saying I really couldn’t say. I have no background or education in the  stock market. I’m a speechwriter.
1766,toby,"I can tell you, Leela. Ask the Treasury Secretary. Ask the Chairman of the Federal  Reserve. I’m a total novice at this. "
1767,toby,I have never owned a share of stock until last year. 
1768,toby,I use the website. I like the company.
1769,toby,That’s right.
1770,toby,"Leela, I’m as surprised as anybody. I didn’t know until the accountant called your  office."
1771,toby,Of course I didn’t. I’m telling you that I’ve never paid any attention...
1772,toby,Yes?
1773,toby,Yeah.
1774,toby,Tillinghouse?
1775,toby,Thank you. 
1776,toby,"Leela, I’ve got forty-eight hours to a crucial floor vote. Is there any way that...?"
1777,toby,I grew up on the same block as Ted McGregor. He’s very well respected-
1778,toby,"I’m telling you that not only didn’t I know what he was going to say to the  committee, not only didn’t I care what he was going to say to the committee, but  if he had sat in my office while I typed up his testimony for him.  I wouldn’t have understood what he was going to say to the committee!"
1779,toby,What!
1780,toby, Yeah.
1781,toby,Are you saying I should be talking to a lawyer?
1782,josh,So what’s the range of what we’re talking about?
1783,josh,"Thanks, Mrs. Landingham."
1784,sam,What’s she congratulating you on?
1785,josh,I don’t know.
1786,sam,What’s the range?
1787,josh,Yes.
1788,sam,"Votes are expensive. O’Bannon’s going to want the farm subsidies revisited,  Katzenmoyer’s gonna go back to the federal tax exempt metro link. We’re talking  about unions, defense contracts, possibly agency appointments and my point is  that the clock’s running, and we’re no closer to answering the question."
1789,josh,Which question?
1790,sam,How we get five votes without giving away everything in the store.
1791,josh,Thanks.
1792,sam,What the hell’s going on...?
1793,josh,We do it by giving away nothing in the store.
1794,sam,We can’t...
1795,josh,I say nothing.
1796,sam,What’re you saying?
1797,josh,"L.B.J. never would’ve taken this kind of crap from Democrats in Congress. He’d have  said, “You’re voting my way, in exchange for which, it is possible that I might  remember your name.”  Pal, we need to win. And I mean win. We need  to take a curtain call and a victory lap. And that’s how we get momentum. We get it  by being tough. We give away nothing. That’s what I’m taking to Leo."
1798,sam,And Chris Wick?
1799,josh,"Chris Wick, I own his ass."
1800,josh,I sense I’m being mocked.
1802,josh,What did I do?
1804,josh,Really?
1806,josh,What won it for me?
1808,josh,"Ah, yes."
1810,josh,"Well, Sarah was very fond of me."
1812,josh,"All right, this was fun, but Sam and I are busy making critical decisions, and I’m  sure you have a lot of typing to do. So I’ll talk to you later."
1814,josh,I’ll take care of Chris Wick.
1815,sam,Where are you going?
1816,josh, Where are you going? 
1817,sam,I was following you.
1818,josh,"I was following you.  All right, don’t tell anyone this happened, okay?"
1819,toby,Sam! I’ve got a problem. I need to talk to you for a few minutes.
1820,sam,Sure. 
1821,leo,It can be Dom. It can be Kristal. She likes them both.
1822,leo,I don’t drink champagne. The important thing is that it be in a high hat.
1823,leo,"It’s the silver bucket that rests on a tripod. In fact, the whole meal should be  under sterling silver."
1824,leo,Yeah.
1825,leo,I’ll put on a record.
1826,leo,To play the violin?
1827,leo,Is that what people get now?
1828,leo,No. ‘Cause after the initial thing wears off there’s just a guy with a violin in my  house.
1829,leo,Harry Winston’s sending down the choker.
1830,leo,It’s the right size.
1831,leo,My wife’s got a great neck.
1832,leo,Would you stop?
1833,leo,And you can squeeze the life out of a nickel better than any ten people I know.
1834,leo,Stop reading the disclosure reports! They’re none of your business.
1835,josh, Leo?
1836,leo,"Josh, do women like violinists?"
1837,josh,You thinking about taking lessons?
1838,leo,"No, I mean to listen to next to the table."
1839,josh,"Gets a little weird after a minute, doesn’t it?"
1840,leo,That’s what I thought.
1841,josh,Is it Jenny’s birthday?
1842,leo, I forgot our anniversary.
1843,josh,In that case I’d shift into gear and bring on the Julliard String Quartet.
1844,leo, Call the guy.
1845,josh,Leave.	
1846,leo,Call the guy.
1847,josh,I’m going to see Katzenmoyer.
1848,leo,When?
1849,josh,Right now.
1850,leo,What’re you gonna give him?
1851,josh,Nothing more than a wake up call. I want your permission to kick his ass.
1852,leo,You want to dangle his job in front of him?
1853,josh,Yeah.
1854,leo,No.
1855,josh,I wanna let him hear the branch creak.
1856,leo,We do that. It doesn’t work. We can’t do it again. 
1857,josh,"If it doesn’t work, I back off. If it doesn’t work, we give Katzenmoyer a metro link  and we let O’Bannon order off the menu. If it does work, I think we get the other  four votes no problem when word gets out we’re not screwing around."
1858,leo, I should sell tickets to this meeting.
1859,josh,"Your constituents like the Tech 9 and the Rutger Mini 14, do they? They go quail  hunting with an Uzi?"
1860,josh,And you’re not doing so well.
1861,josh,"Fifty-five thousand more people will be shot and killed with guns two years from now,  but that’s very much beside the point."
1862,josh,"Forgive my bluntness, and I say this with all due respect, Congressman, but vote yes,  or you’re not even going to be on the ballot two years from now."
1863,josh,You’re going to lose in the primary.
1864,josh,Sure there is.
1865,josh,Whomever we pick.
1866,josh,"Doesn’t seem to be doing us much good now, does it? "
1867,josh,"No sir. We’re going to do it in person. See, you won with fifty-two percent, but the  President took your district with fifty-nine. And I think it’s high time we come back  and say thanks. Do you have any idea how much noise Air Force One makes when it lands  in Eau Claire, Wisconsin? We’re going to have a party, Congressman. You should come,  it’s gonna be great. And when the watermelon’s done, right in town square, right in  the band gazebo... You guys got a band gazebo?"
1868,josh,"Doesn’t matter, we’ll build one. Right in the band gazebo, that’s where the President  is going to drape his arm around the shoulder of some assistant DA we like. And you  should have your camera with you. You should get a picture of that. ‘Cause that’s  gonna be the moment you’re finished in Democratic politics. President Bartlet’s a  good man. He’s got a good heart. He doesn’t hold a grudge. "
1869,sam,"125,000 dollars?"
1870,toby,Could you stop saying that!?
1871,sam,Sure.
1872,toby,How much trouble am I in?
1873,sam,"Well, there’s two kinds of trouble here: actual trouble and PR trouble."
1874,toby,Talk about actual trouble.
1875,sam,You’re in no actual trouble.
1876,toby,Really?
1877,sam,Absolutely not.
1878,toby,Good.
1879,sam,But I’d hire a lawyer anyway.
1880,toby,Why?
1881,sam,Because technically you’ve committed a felony punishable by imprisonment and fines  reaching into the millions.
1882,toby," All right, let’s move away from actual trouble for a second and  let’s talk about..."
1883,sam,Perception.
1884,toby,Yes.
1885,sam,"We’ve done nothing wrong, yet the perception of those who would choose to glance  only at a snapshot would be embarrassing. "
1886,toby,Say nothing of damaging to the President.
1887,sam, Indeed.
1888,toby,Why are you talking like this?
1889,sam,Because I can’t help but be reminded of a bright and energetic young White House  deputy who took no end of admonition and grief because of a woman he was friends with.
1890,toby,I totally backed you up on that!
1891,sam,Which is why I couldn’t be happier to help you. It’s like being able to do something  for my older brother. I’m your guy on this. What’s your level of confidence?
1892,toby, Absolutely none.
1893,sam,Who else knows about this?
1894,toby,Anyone who saw the report.
1895,sam,"Everybody has the report, but you really have to study it to have..."
1896,sam,"I got your back on this, buddy."
1897,toby,I am so... completely screwed.
1898,c.j.,"145 dollar Armani cravat, which I’m pretty sure is a necktie. It was a gift from  his brother-in-law. He gave it away to the Salvation Army. Information I’m sure the  President would prefer his brother-in-law did not have. "
1899,c.j.,Secret Service improvements.
1900,c.j.,The property now includes a helipad and the ability to run a global war from the  sun porch. 
1901,c.j.,"That’s all for now, folks. Later this afternoon we’ll do Deputy Chief of Staff  Joshua Lyman. "
1902,josh,Thanks for the promo.
1903,c.j.,They really can’t get enough of you.
1904,josh,I got Katzenmoyer.
1905,c.j.,He’s back?
1906,josh,Along with O’Bannon and LeBrandt.
1907,c.j.,You got three!
1908,josh,"Chris Wick’s waiting for me right now. I don’t know what his story is, but I’m not  that worried."
1909,c.j.,You worried about Tillinghouse?
1910,josh,I can’t get him without the Vice President. Leo’s got to lighten up on that.
1911,c.j.,Get Wick first. And then we’ll deal with it. 
1913,josh,Yeah.
1915,josh,I know.
1917,josh,I know.
1919,josh,I know.
1921,josh,I know.
1923,josh,"Actually, it only served as a colossal waste of time and energy. Keep up the good work."
1924,josh,Congressman.
1925,josh,"Right.  Guys, could you wait outside for a minute, please. The Congressman  and I want to talk about old times."
1926,josh," Is that supposed to impress me, you have a staff?"
1927,josh,I told the House minority whip he was crazy. No way is Chris Wick jumping the fence.  Do you have any idea how stupid this makes me look?
1928,josh,"Shove it, dude. We’re not in a frat house anymore. "
1929,josh,Name for me please the weapons banned in this bill and why you feel they should be  legal.
1930,josh,Let’s start here. Name for me please the weapons banned in this bill.
1931,josh,You don’t have a clue.
1932,josh,Mac 90.
1933,josh,The PCR. NFR. Anything ring a bell?
1934,josh,They’re both copycats of the AR 15 assault rifle that was banned two years ago.  It’s the exact same gun.
1935,josh,It’s back. They just changed the grip. How ‘bout the Pat Maxi?
1936,josh, It’s a grenade launcher!
1937,josh,"You know, I realize as an adult not everyone shares my view of the world. And with  an issue as hot as gun control I’m prepared to accept a lot of different points of  view as being perfectly valid. But we can all get together on the grenade launcher,  right?"
1938,josh,I put you in your seat. I got you elected to the House of Representatives.
1939,josh,You’re not serious.
1940,josh,You’re voting down a measure that would restrict the sale of deadly weapons because  nobody invited you to the cool kid’s table?
1941,josh,"You know, I’m so sick of Congress I could vomit.   What do you want?"
1942,josh,President doesn’t play golf.
1943,josh,Chess.
1944,josh,"He’s going to kick your ass, you know."
1945,josh,"Chris, you’re a Congressman. You’ve gotta make that real. This time it was me in  the Mural Room. Trust me when I tell you, you do not wanna have this conversation  with the guy who works next door. "
1946,leo,Wow is right.
1947,c.j.,It is so beautiful.
1948,sam,"Excellent choice, my friend."
1949,leo,Stop looking at me like that. You’re talking about Jenny.
1950,sam, My point being only that it should flatter her neck in ways that  should please you.
1951,c.j.,Can I try it on?
1952,leo,No.
1953,leo,No.
1954,toby,Could we possibly talk about me?
1955,c.j.,Are you saying I’m going to stretch it?
1956,josh," Leo, I got four out of five. I’m absolutely convinced we need the Vice  President to get Tillinghouse."
1957,c.j.,We’re all agreed on that.
1958,leo,No.
1959,josh,This needs a Texan.
1960,leo,I have a different idea.
1961,josh,What?
1962,leo,I go to Richardson.
1963,josh,The entire caucus. Let’s not get ‘em any more pissed off at us than they are already.
1964,leo,I’ll talk to Richardson alone.
1965,josh,You have to do it quietly and right now.
1966,leo, Margaret!
1967,josh,Call me as soon as you’ve got it. 
1968,leo,I need to see Mark Richardson out of the office. 
1969,sam,"You know, Toby. You could afford to buy one of those now if you want."
1970,toby,There’s literally no one in the world that I don’t hate right now. 
1971,leo,"We need this one, Mark."
1972,leo,"Mark, it’s all we could get right now and you know it. "
1973,leo,We did.
1974,leo,We had to lose ‘em.
1975,leo,We have to do this inch by inch. You know how this works.
1976,leo,"That is out of line, Congressman. Guns are number one on my list of priorities and  I’ve never moved the President off of that."
1977,leo,"If the White House isn’t strong, it doesn’t really matter what number two on my  list is. God, Mark. The bodies being wheeled into the emergency room are black.  These guns aren’t going to Scottsdale, Mark, they’re going to Detroit, they’re  going to Philadelphia. An entire generation of African American men are being eaten  alive by drugs and poverty."
1978,leo,"Mark, for God sake..."
1979,josh,Yes.
1980,josh,There are people who like me.
1982,josh,Yeah Leo. We’re going to set up a meeting for you with the Vice President.   Good.
1983,leo,Jenny?
1984,leo,What’s going on?
1985,leo,What’s going on?
1986,leo,It wasn’t any trouble.
1987,leo,I’m sorry about the anniversary. I just...
1988,leo,"This is the most important thing I’ll ever do, Jenny. I have to do it well."
1989,leo," It is more important than my marriage right now. These few years,  while I’m doing this, yes, it’s more important than my marriage. I... I didn’t  decide to do this myself, Jenny. There were many discussions..."
1990,leo,"I’m five votes down, Jenny! And I need to win. I met with the staff..."
1991,leo,I made the time tonight.
1992,leo,I hired a whole...
1993,leo, I was going to slip out for 45 minutes...
1994,leo,I was going to be right back.
1995,leo,I don’t suppose we could postpone this discussion until... It’s just the past  couple of days...
1996,leo,Okay.
1997,leo,Okay.
1998,leo, You’ll call me? 
1999,leo,You... you want me to carry that to the cab?
2000,leo, Call me before you go to sleep.
2001,leo,"Good evening, Mr. Vice President."
2002,leo,Thanks.
2003,leo,Um... I came in to talk to you about 802. We lost five votes.
2004,leo,"We got four of them back, but I was stupid with Richardson. And now it’s  Tillinghouse, so I wanted to talk to you about that and..."
2005,leo,"Jenny and I are splitting up and it just happened and I’m feeling a little, um..."
2006,leo,If I could just have a glass of water.
2007,leo,Yeah.
2008,leo,Thank you.  Anyway... 
2009,leo, Yeah?
2010,leo,You’ll deliver him?
2011,leo,I don’t need to tell you we need this win.
2012,leo,"Thanks, John. I want you to know the President and I appreciate it. "
2013,leo,What?
2014,leo,What meeting could I possibly go to?
2015,leo,"John, tell me you are not showing your face-"
2016,leo,Do I have enemies in that room?
2017,leo,I had no idea.
2018,leo,"Uh. No, I’ve got my guy."
2019,leo,Call me after Tillinghouse.
2020,leo,Good night John.
2021,josh,How you doing?
2022,josh,Yes. A smoking jacket and a cigarette holder. Both declared items. I am clean as a whistle.
2023,josh,"I’m sensing trouble, but I can’t quite..."
2024,josh,"Ah, there it was, right in front of my face."
2025,josh,You knew I knew Sarah.
2026,josh,They weren’t by way of saying “Thanks for sleeping with me” if that’s what you mean.
2027,josh,Hey.
2028,toby,What’s going on?
2029,josh,Hoynes is having breakfast with Tillinghouse.
2030,josh,I really thought a nice by-product of not going out with you anymore would be that  you wouldn’t yell at me anymore.
2031,josh,Where’s the President?
2032,toby,Haven’t seen him.
2033,c.j.,"Leo, how’d it go?"
2034,leo,What do you mean?
2035,josh,Last night.
2036,leo," Oh. Oh, great."
2037,c.j.,She liked the choker?
2038,leo,Yeah.
2039,josh,And the violinist?
2040,leo,"Uh. You-You’re right. After a couple of minutes it’s strange having him there.  But, uh, you know um...  She ate it up, so..."
2041,toby,Where’s the President?
2042,leo,His back is pretty bad today. He canceled the morning. He’ll stay in bed and make  some calls. We should move this to my...
2043,bartlet,Hey!
2044,leo,Mr. President. I thought you were staying in bed. 
2045,bartlet,"Oh, I feel fine."
2046,leo,Uh... Maybe you should get back to the residence.
2047,bartlet,Hmm?
2048,leo,"I said, maybe you should get back to the residence. Maybe you should lie down."
2049,bartlet,Absolutely no need. I’m fine. What’s going on here?
2050,sam,"Nothing you need to concern yourself with, Mr. President. Merely a perception issue  regarding Toby and the financial disclosure."
2051,bartlet,I like to...  ...get involved.
2052,c.j.,Mr. President. Did you by any chance take your back pills?
2053,bartlet,I don’t mind telling you C.J. I was in a little pain there.
2054,leo,"Which did you take, sir, the Vicadin or the Percocet? "
2055,bartlet,I wasn’t supposed to take ‘em both?
2056,c.j.,"Okay. Mr. President, we’re going to have someone take you back to bed."
2057,bartlet,No no no. Sit sit sit. 
2058,sam," I’m Sam, sir."
2059,bartlet,"Sam, of course you are."
2060,toby,"Sir. Sir... The situation basically is this. I arranged for a friend to testify  to Commerce on Internet stocks while simultaneously, but unrelated to that, bought  a technology issue which, partly due to my friend’s testimony, shot through the roof."
2061,bartlet,"Toby.  Toby’s a nice name, don’t you think?"
2062,toby, Could we possibly do this meeting at another time?
2063,bartlet,"No, no, no, no. Please, Leo. I know my body. I mean, you know, my muscles are not,  you know, but my mind is sharp. I can focus. I’m focused. You all know that about me.  Here’s what I think we ought to do...  Was I just saying something?"
2064,leo, Mrs. Landingham!
2065,leo,Get Charlie.
2066,sam,What do you mean?
2067,bartlet,Hot damn! Now you’re talking.
2068,toby,"I think she meant me, Mr. President."
2069,bartlet,Ah.
2070,leo,Well of course Toby’s not going to resign. I think we’re making more of this than we...
2071,sam,I got it!
2072,toby,I’ve got a lawyer from the White House Counsel’s office-
2073,sam,I got it!
2074,sam,Counsel’s office releases a statement through C.J. Using the strongest possible  language we make it very clear that there’s been no wrongdoing of any kind.
2075,toby,Yes.
2076,sam,"But to avoid even the appearance of impropriety, Toby has agreed to reduce his salary  for one year to one dollar, and immediately cash out his stock issue thereby relieving  the taxpayer of the burden."
2077,bartlet,Done.
2078,toby,Wait.
2079,leo,"Good, Sam."
2080,sam,Thank you.
2081,toby,"No, no, it’s not good. Actually, it stinks."
2082,bartlet,"Toby, you’re a great writer, do you know that?"
2083,toby,"Well, thank you very much sir."
2084,bartlet,"Here, give me a hug."
2085,toby, Leo!
2086,bartlet,Come on. Give us a hug.  There you go.
2087,bartlet,Charlie!
2088,bartlet,Charlie’s a great name.
2089,bartlet,I’m going. I’m going.   I’m seriously thinking about getting a dog.
2090,leo,"Well, feel better Mr. President."
2091,bartlet,"Maybe an Irish setter, Charlie. What do you think? "
2092,sam," So, how do you feet there, big guy? "
2093,toby, Like I just got screwed with my pants on.
2094,sam,Excellent.
2095,sam,I don’t believe it.
2096,sam,And keeps the ketchup.
2097,c.j.,"Sorry, Leo. You saw this one coming through the Holland Tunnel."
2098,leo,We got what we deserved. It was hubris and we got what we deserved.   Night everyone.
2099,leo,Listen. We won. 
2100,toby,Where’s the President?
2101,c.j.,He’s asleep.
2102,toby,Wake him up.
2103,c.j.,Toby.
2104,toby,Wake him now.
2105,c.j.,"Let’s leave it till tomorrow, Toby. Let’s leave it till tomorrow. "
2106,josh, Evening Mr. Vice President.
2107,josh,Are you talking about the bill or are you talking about my smoking jacket?
2108,josh,It’s a crappy law.
2109,josh,"No, it is. I should know. I helped write it."
2110,josh,I’d say it’s roughly the equivalent of fighting the war against tobacco by banning  certain color matchbook covers.
2111,josh,"I’d say you did well, sir. In fact, you might be the only one who did. I just came  by to say congratulations."
2112,josh,Yes sir?
2113,leo, Yeah. I’m here for the card game.
2114,leo,Thank you.
2115,josh,Oh yes!
2116,toby,Game point.
2117,bartlet,I’m fine.
2118,bartlet,Why would I want to do that?
2119,josh,Cause people are bound to be pretty upset when they find out we killed the President.
2120,toby,"Sit down, sir."
2121,bartlet,"All right, game point. Let’s go."
2122,josh,Sir...
2123,bartlet,I’m playing.
2124,toby,"Mr. President, there’s no shame in calling it quits. All you have to do is say,  “Toby, you’re the superior athlete,” and slink on off the court."
2125,bartlet,"Take the ball out, Toby."
2126,toby,You’re really going to keep playing?
2127,bartlet,Take the ball out. Let’s go.
2128,toby,"Oh, this is perfect, you know that? This is a perfect metaphor. After you’re gone,  and the poets write, “The Legend of Josiah Bartlet,” let them write you as a tragic  figure, sir. Let the poets write that he had the tools of greatness, but the voices  of his better angels was shouted down by his obsessive need to win."
2129,bartlet,You want to play or write my eulogy?
2130,toby,"Can I be honest with you, sir?"
2131,bartlet,Mr. Grant!
2132,josh,Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Who’s this guy?
2133,bartlet,I’m making a substitution.
2134,toby,Who is this guy?
2135,bartlet,Mr. Grant’s a new member of my team.
2136,toby,"A ringer, perhaps?"
2137,bartlet,Mr. Grant is a federal employee.
2138,toby,"You know the thing about you, Mr. President? It isn’t so much that you cheat. It’s  how brazenly bad you are at it."
2139,bartlet,I beg your pardon?
2140,josh,Toby’s got a point there sir.
2141,bartlet,When have I ever cheated?
2142,toby,"Up on Florida, playing mixed doubles with me and C.J. You tried to tell us that your  partner worked at the American Consulate in Vienna."
2143,bartlet,And she did!
2144,toby,"It was Steffi Graf, sir."
2145,bartlet,"Well, I will admit that the woman bore a striking resemblance..."
2146,toby,"It was Steffi Graf, you crazy lunatic! You think I’m not gonna recognize Steffi Graf  when she’s serving a tennis ball at me?"
2147,josh,"Steffi Graf’s won quite a few championships, sir. We’ve had many opportunities to  see photographs."
2148,bartlet,"Be that as it may, Toby Ziegler, Josh Lyman, Charlie Young. I would like to  introduce Mr. Rodney Grant. Mr. Grant is Associate Director of the President’s  Council on Physical Fitness. Game point. Your ball. Let’s go!"
2149,toby,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. "
2150,bartlet,What? 
2151,toby,Not so fast.
2152,bartlet,What’s the problem?
2153,toby,"Mr. Grant, your name sounds awfully familiar... Before you joined up with the  President’s Council on Physical Fitness, a council, I might add, the President would  do well to avail himself of... Is it possible, that you played some organized ball?"
2154,toby,And where was that?
2155,toby,Where would that be?
2156,toby,This guy was in the Final Four!
2157,bartlet,"Take the ball out, Toby. Game point. Let’s go."
2158,toby,Alright.
2159,bartlet,The new man.
2160,toby, I’m taking you to the hole.
2161,josh,You got it!
2162,toby,Oh!
2163,bartlet,"Let the poets write about that there, Byron."
2164,toby,"Charlie, guard the new guy."
2166,josh,That’s... where I’m going.
2168,josh,"Yes, but you see that’s obviously where I’m going, and yet you tell me anyway."
2170,josh,That you seek to control me?
2172,josh,Love it.
2174,josh,Who’s Donald?
2176,josh,Yes.
2178,josh,"Right.  Can we clear up a few things about my  level of interest in the revolving door of local gomers that you see, in the free  time you create by not working very hard at your job?"
2180,josh,You work hard at your job.
2182,josh,Very hard.
2184,josh,Not at all controlling.
2186,josh,On my way.
2188,josh,What?
2190,josh,Donna?
2192,josh,Thank you. 
2194,josh,"I don’t know. But this is the White House, so it’s probably not that important."
2195,c.j.,Josh!
2196,josh,Ma’am.
2197,c.j.,There’s an article I want you to read in the New Yorker.
2198,josh,What’s it about?
2199,c.j.,Smallpox.
2200,josh,The disease?
2201,c.j.,"No, the dessert topping, Josh."
2202,josh,Okay.
2203,c.j.,"Yes, the disease."
2204,sam,"But, generally speaking, we try to do it on the first of every month."
2205,toby,We’ve done it twice in 12 months.
2206,sam,We’re a little behind.
2207,toby,It’s “Throw Open Our Office Doors To People Who Want To Discuss Things That We  Could Care Less About... Day”
2208,sam,It’s not so bad. You talk to them for a minute. You give them a souvenir pen with  the Presidential seal on it.
2209,leo, Good morning.
2210,toby, Sadly you’re about to find out.
2211,leo,"Andrew Jackson, in the main foyer of his White House had a big block of cheese."
2212,toby,Hmmm.
2213,leo,"I am making a mental list of those who are snickering, and even as I speak I’m  preparing appropriate retribution.  The block of cheese was huge--over two  tons. And it was there for any and all who might be hungry."
2214,toby,"Leo, wouldn’t this time be better spent plotting a war against a country that can’t  possibly defend itself against us?"
2215,leo,"We can do that later, Toby. Right now I’m talking about President Andrew Jackson."
2216,sam,"Actually, right now, you’re talking about a big block of cheese."
2217,leo,And Sam goes on my list!
2218,sam,What about Toby?
2219,leo,"I’m unpredictable.  Jackson wanted the White House to belong to the people,  so from time to time, he opened his doors to those who wished an audience."
2220,leo,It is in that spirit...
2221,sam,Hang on. Mandy doesn’t go on the list?
2222,leo,Mandy’s new.
2223,sam,So it’s just me... on the list?
2224,leo,"Yes. It is in the spirit of Andrew Jackson that I, from time to time, ask senior  staff to have face-to-face meetings with those people representing organizations  who have a difficult time getting our attention.  I know the more jaded among  you, see this as something rather beneath you. But I assure you that listening to the  voices of passionate Americans is beneath no one, and surely not the peoples’ servants."
2225,josh," Sorry, we’re late. Is it “Total Crackpot Day” again?"
2226,leo,"Yes, it is."
2227,sam,And let us please note that Josh does not go on the list.
2228,leo, Actually you’ve got a thing right now.
2229,josh,"Yeah, I know. Donna told me."
2230,leo,"Margaret, hand out those appointments would you?"
2231,josh,What’s up?
2232,leo,First of all... 
2233,josh,Ow!
2234,leo,That’s for “Total Crackpot Day.”
2235,josh,"Yeah, yeah."
2236,leo,"Second of all, this is Jonathan Lacey."
2237,josh,Josh Lyman.
2238,josh,What can I do for you?
2239,josh, Who’s us?
2240,josh, They told me that a minute... What’s the card do?
2241,josh, You’re kidding me.
2242,josh," Sure...well,um...Okay, I really, um, I don’t know what to say."
2243,leo, I guess that’s it then?
2244,josh,Sure. Sure...and my staff goes with me or do they have separate...?
2245,josh, And I think the best thing to do is just forget all about it. I’ll go now.
2246,sam,"Last week’s rise in the producer’s price index coupled with the increasingly tight  labor market have sparked a growing concern over future inflation. Do you share that  concern, sir?"
2247,bartlet,"No, Helen, I don’t. The U.S. economy is fundamentally..."
2248,sam,"Ah! I wasn’t Helen there, sir. Actually, I was Sandy King."
2249,bartlet,From the... Miami Herald?
2250,sam,She moved to The Sun-Times.
2251,bartlet,"But, your voice sounded the same as when you did Helen."
2252,sam," Do you share that concern, sir?"
2253,bartlet,"No, not at all. The U.S. economy remains fundamentally strong as the steady decline  in unemployment reflects, which I think is cause for satisfaction, not gloom. The  solitary aberrant spike in the P.P.I. is not cause for overreaction."
2254,sam,You might also want to point out that there’s been no corresponding increase in  wholesale prices.
2255,bartlet,"I AM an economics professor with a big old stick up my butt, but I’ll do my best for  you there, Mandy."
2256,sam, That’s it for the economy.
2257,toby,Let’s move to guns.
2258,bartlet,We don’t need to do guns.
2259,toby,"Sir, they are absolutely gonna ask about guns."
2260,bartlet,"I’m not saying they’re not gonna ask about them, Toby. I’m saying I’m all set."
2261,toby,"How ‘bout one or two questions, Mr. President?"
2262,bartlet, Is it time for my 10 a.m. scolding?
2263,leo,"Are we gonna have this argument, again?"
2264,toby, Mr. President...
2265,bartlet,Let’s do guns.
2266,toby,Sir...
2267,bartlet,"Let’s do guns, Sam."
2268,sam,"Mr. President, is there any reason to believe this victory, this weapons ban bill,  will have any significant reduction in crime?"
2269,bartlet,"Yes, next question."
2270,toby,Mr. President...
2271,bartlet,Ah! Mr. Ziegler from the Coney Island Killjoy. You have a follow up?
2272,toby,"You’re gonna take the question. We’re lucky enough to get the question, you’re  gonna take it and blow it off?"
2273,bartlet,Yes.
2274,toby,"Due respect, sir, may I ask why?"
2275,bartlet,‘Cause I’m weak-willed and stupid.
2276,leo,Let’s do this another time.
2277,toby,"Four days ago sir, we talked this over."
2278,bartlet,Then I talked it over with some other people.
2279,toby,Which people?
2280,bartlet,I have lots of other people.
2281,toby,"Sir, I believe we are missing a huge opportunity here..."
2282,c.j.,What’s going on?
2283,josh,Hmm?
2284,c.j.,What’s going on?
2285,josh,"Oh, we’re doing the thing."
2286,c.j.,Why aren’t you in there?
2287,josh,I was just going in.
2288,c.j.,"Good morning, Mrs. Landingham. Where are we in the saga of Toby and the President?"
2289,c.j.,A disagreement or a fight?
2290,c.j., Josh!
2291,josh,Hmm?
2292,c.j.,Let’s go in. 
2293,toby,Sir...
2294,bartlet,I’m not gonna come out and say the bill we just passed is worthless.
2295,toby,If we could just admit its weaknesses.
2296,toby,Why not?
2297,bartlet,"Yeah, my answer was gonna be “because I said so,” but you did pretty good."
2298,sam,Yes.
2299,toby,"By changing some words, the world can move or not by changing some words."
2300,bartlet,What’s your point?
2301,toby,"I have many points, sir. I choose not to make them right now."
2302,bartlet," Well, on behalf of everybody in the west wing, Toby, let me just  say that that’s a relief."
2303,sam,"Excuse me, Leo."
2304,leo,Yes?
2305,sam,"Cathy tells me my first “cheese” appointment is here, but I think preparing the  President for this press conference should be a priority."
2306,c.j.,I agree.
2307,leo,No.
2308,c.j.,"Leo, it..."
2309,leo,No!
2310,sam,But I really need to get...
2311,leo,You’re not getting out of these appointments.
2312,c.j.,This is a very important press conference.
2313,leo,This is a thoroughly unimportant press conference.
2314,sam,I think this press conference is about our future.
2315,bartlet, I think this press conference is about we haven’t had a press  conference in a while.
2316,leo,"Sam, go."
2317,bartlet,We’re going too.
2318,toby,Sir...
2319,leo, We’ll pick this up this afternoon.
2320,sam,"So, you are from the United States Space Command?"
2321,sam,This is my first time.
2322,sam,You camouflage it well with your clothing.
2323,sam,"What can I do for you, Bob?"
2324,sam,So to speak.
2325,sam,Are we paying any attention at all right now?
2326,sam,Thank God. Like we don’t have enough trouble with the First Lady and her Ouija board.
2327,sam,I really can’t do that.
2328,sam,"Because the President will either yell at me or laugh at me. Either way, it won’t  work out well for me."
2329,sam,No.
2330,sam,"Because there are levels and an order to our air defense command, and to jump from  a radar officer to a commander-in-chief would skip several of those levels."
2331,sam,"Like the Pentagon, and, you know, perhaps, therapy."
2332,sam,"Bob, no hard feelings, but I can’t walk into the cabinet room and ask the President  to put down the budget surplus because there are flying saucers over Maui."
2333,sam,"It’s been good meeting with you, and I hope that you don’t feel that you’ve wasted  your time... I leave you with this pen. "
2334,c.j.,You don’t have to worry about me on Hollywood fund-raisers. You have to worry about  Toby.
2335,c.j.,I’m in.
2336,c.j.,This wasn’t the one we used during the primary?
2337,c.j.,Where was the one where Roberto Benigni pushed me into this swimming pool?
2338,c.j.,"Which would be fine if Roberto Benigni can vote in our elections, but since he’s  Italian, that makes me a six foot wet girl in a Donna Karan dress."
2339,leo,"I’m the only one in the room who isn’t an economist, but it seems to me that the  annual budget for the new fiscal year is found either in balance, in deficit, or  in surplus. I don’t know how I can sell congress, to say nothing of people who  graduated eighth grade on the idea that there’s anything in between."
2340,bartlet,Leo’s not talking about the portion being accounted for as off budget and  particularly not the long-term capital outlays.
2341,leo, Here’s where you lose me.
2342,bartlet,"Ten years ago, the federal budget had a deficit of 22 billion dollars but the  national debt rose... "
2343,leo,The President’s startlingly freakish that way.
2344,bartlet, Zoey’s coming for dinner.
2345,leo,She’s in town!
2346,bartlet,"Yeah.  My daughter’s starting Georgetown after the first and  she’s scouting off-campus housing. Guys, we’re done. I’m sorry, but some of my staff  has been waiting and they haven’t had the chance to bother me for a couple of hours.  Thanks so much."
2347,bartlet,I’m gonna make chili!
2348,leo,Yeah.
2349,bartlet,I’ll make it for everybody. Charlie!
2350,leo,Sir...
2351,bartlet,"My friends, my daughter, my beer, and some chili. Yes!"
2352,leo,"And you’re gonna be the one to, you know, cook this food?"
2353,bartlet,"Ah, Charlie. My youngest daughter, Zoey, is down from Hanover. I’m making chili  tonight. It’s her favorite."
2354,bartlet,The first lady’s in Pakistan. I can eat whatever I want.
2355,bartlet,I’m gonna need some ingredients.
2356,leo,"Well, he’ll need some chili."
2357,bartlet,"Don’t ever listen to him. Look, Mrs. Landingham’s got it all written down somewhere.  Just tell her to give it to the steward’s office. And send everyone else in."
2358,bartlet,"Thank you, Charlie!"
2359,leo,How could you possibly remember that ten years ago there was a 188 million dollar  debt increase off a 22 billion dollar deficit?
2360,bartlet," God, I was right?"
2361,leo,"Ah, see, that’s what I thought."
2362,bartlet,"Everyone! Come in. Come on in. Hey, listen up everybody. Zoey’s down from Hanover.  I’m making chili for everyone tonight."
2363,bartlet, All right...You know what? Let’s do this. Everybody  look down at the big seal in the middle of my carpet.
2364,bartlet,"Now, everybody look back up at me. Zoey’s coming down from Hanover and I’m making  chili for everyone tonight."
2365,bartlet,"There, you see how benevolent I can be, when everyone does what I tell them to do.  Now sit down. "
2366,leo,"I would like this meeting to last no more than three minutes. I will allow it to  last no more than five. Speak, Mandy."
2367,leo,Yes.
2368,toby,Nope.
2369,toby,‘Cause 24 hours earlier the President’s gonna give a speech to the entertainment  industry on violence in film and television.
2370,sam,A speech I don’t think we should be giving.
2371,toby,That’s beside the point.
2372,toby,Larry Posner’s movies are incredibly violent.
2373,sam,So is The Godfather. What you mean to say is Larry Posner’s movies are incredibly bad.
2374,toby,"No, actually, what I mean to say is Larry Posner’s movies are indicative of a  Hollywood that is excessibly violent, arrogantly violent, and is promoting violence  and the disrespect to human life. Either way, I don’t see how we can admonish  Hollywood on a Tuesday and cash their check on a Wednesday. How can we do that?"
2375,bartlet, Cause it’s Hollywood. Who gives a damn?
2376,toby,"Now, hang on a second, Mr. President, you have me drafting a speech for the  entertainment industry, where we more than suggest to come right out and say that  much of their product is corruptive. Now are we doing this because we believe that  it’s time for them to take moral leadership seriously or are we doing it because  nobody ever lost an election attacking Hollywood?"
2377,bartlet,Why can’t we do both?
2378,toby," That’s not hypocritical, sir?"
2379,bartlet,No.
2380,toby,Why not?
2381,bartlet,"Because Sam is right. It’s not that Larry Posner’s movies have gratuitous sex and  gratuitous violence. It’s that they suck. They’re terrible. But people go to see them  because they have gratuitous sex and gratuitous violence. Now, if we could just get  people to stop going to see crappy movies, Posner would stop making them. I promise you."
2382,toby,"How’s that strategy working for us in the war on drugs, sir?"
2383,leo,Toby...
2384,toby,"We are going to go out there and implore these people to step up to the plate and not  be quite so casual with the awesome influence that they have. That’s fantastic. But,  sir, every time someone makes headlines by blowing thunder at this ridiculous target,  it only serves as a criminal distraction in the pursuit of actual solutions. Now, let  me just say one other thing. If I were an actor, a writer, or a director, or a producer  in Hollywood and someone would start coming at me with a list of things that were  American and un-American, I’d start to think that this was sounding eerily familiar."
2385,bartlet," Do I look like Joe McCarthy to you, Toby?"
2386,toby,No sir. Nobody ever looks like Joe McCarthy. That’s how they get in the door in the  first place.
2387,c.j.,We seem to have wandered off the point a bit.
2388,leo,Yeah. And time’s up.
2389,c.j.,"Thank you, Mr. President."
2390,bartlet,"Chili, tonight!"
2391,josh,"Yes, sir."
2392,sam,You okay?
2393,josh,Yeah.
2394,sam,‘Cause you look a little...you know...
2395,josh,No. No.
2396,sam,Cathy?
2397,sam,You ate it.
2398,sam,"Hey, is there any word yet on the..."
2399,sam, Had a guy on my office today. He’d like us to spend a little more time  working on UFOs.
2400,josh,Are we spending any time working on UFOs?
2401,sam,That’s what I said.
2402,josh,‘Cause coming on the heels of Mrs. Bartlet’s Ouija board...
2403,sam,I hear you.
2404,josh,I’m closing the door. 
2405,sam,The Central Pacific Command’s been picking this thing up on radar all day.
2406,josh,Sam?
2407,sam,Right.
2408,josh,"Listen, you’re close with Cathy, right?"
2409,sam,"I haven’t seen her naked, if that’s what you’re asking."
2410,josh," No, Sam. Well, that’s not what I’m asking."
2411,sam,"I mean, she’s like my younger sister, but she gets paid, and..."
2412,josh,Right.
2413,sam,And she frightens me.
2414,josh,Yes.
2415,sam,But I love her.
2416,josh,Yeah.
2417,sam,It’s like you and Donna.
2418,josh,"Right.  When they gave you a card and they told you... that it was just you  and not Cathy, how did you... how’d you feel about that?"
2419,sam,When they gave me what card?
2420,josh,The N.S.C. guy... the card with the directions.
2421,sam,The directions to...
2422,josh,"You, C.J., Toby. I’m saying when the N.S.C. guy gave you your cards."
2423,sam,Josh... What card?
2424,c.j.,Who’s Pluie?
2425,c.j.,That’s Pluie.
2426,c.j.,Pluie’s a wolf?
2427,c.j.,And you’re gonna tell me her story? 
2428,c.j.,"Sure, ‘cause no photo I.D. "
2429,c.j.,That was a joke.
2430,c.j.,Really?
2431,c.j.,That helps explain Buckingham Palace. 
2432,c.j.,Sure.
2433,c.j., The wolves-only roadway?
2434,c.j., An 1800-mile wolves-only roadway?
2435,c.j.,Hang on. How are you gonna teach wolves to follow road signs?
2436,c.j.,"Yeah, but in the meantime, Pluie’s gonna get drunk and wander off the wolves-only  road and end up eating my cat."
2437,c.j.,I don’t think this is gonna happen. 
2438,c.j.,"First of all, ranchers don’t want wolves returned to the West."
2439,c.j.,"No, they’re not. And anyone who says it should take it back. Ranchers face the  following conditions: falling stock prices, rising taxes, prolonged drought, and  a country that’s eating less beef. Ranchers want to blame something, and because  they’re ranchers, they want to fight something. I’d rather be a wolf than us, so  unless Pluie registers to vote..."
2440,c.j.,I’m... sorry to hear that.
2441,c.j.," Just out of curiosity, how much would it cost?"
2442,c.j.," No, seriously, how much would it cost?"
2443,c.j.,We’re not gonna do it.
2444,c.j.,You think?
2445,c.j.,Nine hundred million dollars?
2446,c.j.,How about we build the nine best schools in the world?
2447,toby,Hi.
2448,toby,"What’d you get him, a spot on Hollywood Squares?"
2449,toby,"No, you don’t."
2450,toby,Go ahead.
2451,toby,I don’t like going up against you.
2452,toby,That’s you being nice?
2453,toby, Excuse me?
2454,toby,Remember a month ago when I asked you if I was the President’s first choice?
2455,c.j.,We’re back to this?
2456,toby,And you called me paranoid?
2457,c.j.,Yes.
2458,toby,And a nudnik. You called me a paranoid nudnik.
2459,c.j.,"Toby, for the 48th time, you are not the President’s second choice."
2460,toby,What about David Rosen?
2461,c.j.,What about David Rosen?
2462,toby,"Mandy was just in my office, and she said she was happy David Rosen passed on my job."
2463,c.j.,"Carol, we’re gonna start in a few minutes."
2464,c.j.,Give ‘em fair warning.
2465,toby,David Rosen.
2466,c.j.,"I don’t... Toby, I know nothing about David Rosen, and I don’t know where this is  coming from."
2467,toby,He’s about to have a press conference. Let me talk to him about the gun thing.  We’ll just leave Hollywood for some other time.
2468,c.j.,Since when do you need help talking to the President?
2469,toby,Since all of a sudden I became the kid in the class with his hand raised that nobody  wants the teacher to call on.
2470,c.j.,That’s silly.
2471,toby,"No, it is not."
2472,c.j.,Toby...
2473,toby,"Just help me, please."
2474,josh,"So, like I said, I appreciate you squeezing me in like this."
2475,josh,You shouldn’t have Stan. It’s not a big deal.
2476,josh,"Uh, I’m out of practice."
2477,josh,"Well, I think the idea will make some people I work for nervous. "
2478,josh,"Hmm. This is gonna sound silly.  There’s a magazine article... a magazine  article came out... and it said that several countries, some of them are enemies,  have stored in freezers the smallpox virus."
2479,josh,No...Don’t laugh.  I can’t get “Ave Maria” out of my head.
2480,josh,"Yeah, I swear it. I’ve been humming it to myself all morning. It’s the strangest  thing... Why do you think the “Ave Maria?”"
2481,josh,"I don’t know... My sister used to play it over and over in her room, but that was,  I don’t know how many years ago."
2482,josh,Joanie.
2483,josh,"She liked music... a lot. She liked it a lot. She wanted to be an orchestra conductor.  She used to pretend she was conducting the music. Anyway, there’s that. Plus, I have  to tell you. I was a little thrown off this morning when they gave me this card. And  it turns out that I was the only one who got one. I mean, of my friends. It surprised  me... Joanie and Toby and C.J. and Sam."
2484,josh,What?
2485,josh,"I meant... No, ‘cause we were just talking about Joanie."
2486,josh,"It was uh... there really are some things I’m not allowed to talk about. I assure  you, I’m not withholding anything I’m supposed to be emotionally available for."
2487,josh,Thanks.
2488,josh,I got to go. 
2489,josh,"It’s really not a big deal, Stanley. I’m sorry I had you cancel an appointment."
2490,josh,It was an impulse. I wasted your time.
2491,josh,I’ve told you.
2492,josh,"Sure, I have."
2493,josh,"It’s not a big deal.  Uh, she was babysitting for me,  and there was a fire."
2494,josh,I honestly... I don’t remember... Something about a popcorn maker.
2495,josh,Yeah.
2496,josh,Yeah.
2497,josh,I ran out of the house.
2498,josh, Yeah.
2499,c.j.,Josh? I was knocking but you didn’t answer.
2500,josh,I didn’t hear the door.
2501,c.j.,What are you doing?
2502,josh,I think I’m ready to brief the President on the smallpox article.
2503,c.j.,"Why don’t you forget about that for tonight, and come have some chili? Everyone’s  there."
2504,josh,"C.J., an N.S.C. staffer gave me a card with instructions on it for what I’m supposed  to do in the event of a nuclear attack. They want me up in the plane or down on a  bunker. They don’t want you... or Sam, or Toby, for that matter. I didn’t want to be  friends with you and have you not know."
2505,c.j.,"Josh, have you been upset about this?"
2506,josh,Yes.
2507,c.j.,You’re very sweet sometimes. You really are.
2508,c.j.,"Of course, they don’t want me, Josh. I’m a press secretary. I don’t think they’re  gonna be issuing a whole lot of releases. Sam and Toby are communications and my  guess is that speech writing won’t be a priority either. Come, have some fun. "
2509,josh, This is a beautiful piece of music. Do you know this?
2510,c.j., I’m Catholic.
2511,josh,"Hang on. Listen. Listen.  Schubert was crazy, you know."
2512,c.j.,Yes.
2513,josh,Do you think you have to be crazy to create something powerful?
2514,c.j.,"Josh, the cold war is over. There’s not gonna be a nuclear..."
2515,josh,"God, C.J. It’s not gonna be like that. It’s not gonna be the red phone and nuclear  bombs."
2516,c.j.,What’s it gonna be?
2517,josh,"It’s gonna be this. It’s gonna be something like this. Smallpox has been gone for  50 years. No one has an acquired immunity. Flies through the air. You get it...  you carry a ten foot cloud around with you. One in three people die. If 100 people  in New York City got it, you’d have to encircle them with 100 million vaccinated  people to contain it. Do you know how many doses of smallpox vaccines exist in the  country? Seven. If 100 people in New York City get it, there’s gonna be a global  medical emergency that’s gonna make HIV look like cold and flu season. That’s how  it’s gonna be, a little test tube with a-a rubber cap that’s deteriorating... A guy  steps out of Times Square Station. Pshht... Smashes it on the sidewalk... There is  a world war right there."
2518,c.j.,We’ll make more vaccine. 
2519,josh,You better hurry ‘cause I’m the only one with one of these cards.
2520,c.j.,Come have chili. The President’s asking for you.
2521,josh,"Yeah, I’ll be right there in a minute."
2522,c.j.,You really are very sweet sometimes. 
2523,bartlet,"Sam, it’s all about mastering the fundamentals, see? Got to keep your hands up,  your feet moving on defense. Pass and get open or find the open man, and follow his  shot on offense. See, I am a master of fundamentals, and that is why my team so  thoroughly dominated your team."
2524,sam,It probably didn’t hurt so much to have a 2 time A.C.C. player of the week on your team.
2525,bartlet," Leo, kids don’t understand the fundamentals."
2526,leo,"No appreciation for the game, Mr. President."
2527,bartlet,"Mrs. Landingham, are you drunk?"
2528,bartlet,I just like asking.
2529,bartlet,"Oh, give it up. Where’s Zoey? "
2530,c.j.,Wolves don’t kill people. That’s a myth.
2531,toby,Where along the way did she turn into a wolf person?
2532,c.j.,More people get killed getting change out of vending machines than get killed by  a wolf attack.
2533,c.j.,Number of people killed last year retrieving change from a vending machine: four.  Number of people killed by a wolf attack: zero.
2534,toby, Excuse me. One second.
2536,toby," So, I guess we haven’t been getting along too well lately.  Have we, sir?"
2537,bartlet,"No, I guess not."
2538,toby,I’ve been... irritating you?
2539,bartlet,Yes.
2540,toby,Was David Rosen your first choice for my job?
2541,bartlet, Yes.
2542,toby,"Well, I’m glad we had this little talk, sir. I feel a lot better. Thank you, sir. "
2543,bartlet,"We were up all night on that one, Toby. Me and Leo and Josh. They were screaming  at me, “Governor, for God’s sakes, it’s got to be Toby. It’s got to be Toby.” When  I held my ground, and we went to David Rosen, and Rosen said he wanted to take a  partnership at Solomon Brothers, thank God... I couldn’t live without you Toby.  I mean it. I’d be in the tall grass. I’d be in the weeds... I know I disappoint you  sometimes. I mean I can sense your disappointment. And I only get mad because I know  you’re right a lot of the times, but you are not the kid in the class with his hand  up and whatever it was you said to C.J. You are a wise and brilliant man, Toby...  The other night when we were playing basketball, did you mean what you said? My  demons were shouting down the better angels in my brain?"
2544,toby,"Yes, sir. I did."
2545,bartlet,You think that’s what’s stopping me from greatness?
2546,toby,Yes.
2547,bartlet,I suppose you’re right.
2548,toby,"Tell you what though, sir. In a battle between a President’s demons and his better  angels, for the first time in a long while, I think we might just have ourselves a  fair fight."
2549,bartlet,"Thank you, Toby.  Now, go away."
2550,josh,Drop the spoon!
2551,josh,You look good!
2552,josh,"Oh, thanks very much. I’m seeing a new barber."
2553,josh,Mind your own business.  What classes are you taking?
2554,josh,Okay.
2555,josh,"Charlie, you met Zoey Bartlet?"
2556,josh,"Okay, hang on a second. Let’s take it back a moment and give it another chance.  This is a girl, Charlie. You don’t have to call her “ma’am.”"
2557,josh,That would be her father.
2558,josh,"Ah, ah, ah. "
2559,josh,You’re fine.
2560,josh,"See, you guys. "
2561,c.j.,"I don’t know. I mean, maybe the vending machines fall on them while they’re getting  their change."
2562,leo,"Pluie really got to you, huh?"
2563,c.j.,"She really was very sweet, Leo."
2564,bartlet,Josh! We’ve been looking for you.
2565,c.j., I’ll be over here.
2566,bartlet,"Look at this, will you?"
2567,josh,At what sir?
2568,bartlet,"I don’t know why, but nothing makes me feel quite so good as the sight of colleagues,  enjoying each other outside work."
2569,josh,"So, what were you guys talking about?"
2570,bartlet,We were talking about these women.
2571,josh,Yeah?
2572,leo,We can’t get over these women.
2573,bartlet,Look at C.J.
2574,leo,Look at Mandy over there.
2575,bartlet,Mrs. Landingham.
2576,josh,"Mr. President, there’s something that’s been bothering me for most of the day, and  while I know that this is an inappropriate time..."
2577,leo,"No, what’s on your mind, Josh?"
2578,josh,"I serve at the pleasure of the President, and it’s a great privilege that I will  never forget.  I can’t keep this. I think  it’s a white flag of surrender. I want to be a comfort to my friends in tragedy.  And I want to be able to celebrate with them in triumph. And for all the times in  between, I just want to be able to look them in the eye. Leo, it’s not for me. I  want to be with my friends, my family, and these women."
2579,bartlet,"Uh, excuse me! Thank you. Uh, friends, please... Well, chili’s ready and I hope  you all enjoy it. In fact, since I told you you would enjoy it, I’m reasonably  certain that you will. "
2580,josh,"Yeah, right!"
2581,bartlet,"It’s an incredible adventure you’re starting on, sweetheart. An amazing four years  full of people and experiences you haven’t yet dreamed of. And if you will allow me  just one minute of business, please. I hope that by the time we’re done with our  four years here, we’ll have seen to it that every young person who chooses can go  to college and beyond, regardless of their economic status."
2582,c.j.,"Nine, no help. Jack, no help. Eight, possible flush. King, possible flush. Ace, no  help. Six, possible straight. Dave of love for the dealer. Ace bets."
2583,sam,Check.
2584,c.j.,Check.
2585,leo,Check.
2586,josh,Check.
2587,toby, Check.
2588,c.j.,Mr. President?
2589,bartlet,There is one fruit...
2590,toby,Oh please...
2591,bartlet,There is one fruit...
2592,toby,"Mr. President, check or bet sir. Those are your choices."
2593,bartlet,There is one fruit...
2594,josh,Or you should feel free to give us a quiz on inane trivia.
2595,bartlet,There is one fruit whose seeds are on the outside. Name it please.
2596,c.j.,Is it the kumquat?
2597,bartlet,No.
2598,toby,Check or bet sir?
2599,bartlet,I bet five.
2600,sam,See it.
2601,c.j.,Fold.
2602,leo,See it.
2603,josh,Call.
2604,toby,I see it. And I raise you five.
2605,leo,Trouble...
2606,c.j.,Mr. President?
2607,bartlet,It’s the strawberry.
2608,toby,"Well, thank you sir. I just raised your bet."
2609,bartlet,"Yes you did Toby, and I thought it was a bold move when you consider that Leo’s  holding the six you’re looking for."
2610,toby,Do you call the raise sir?
2611,bartlet,That depends...
2612,josh,Depends on what?
2613,bartlet,There are fourteen punctuation marks in Standard English grammar. Can anyone name  them please?
2614,c.j.,Period.
2615,josh,Comma.
2616,sam,Semi-colon.
2617,josh,Dash.
2618,sam,Hyphen.
2619,leo,Ah... apostrophe.
2620,bartlet,That’s only seven. There are seven more.
2621,toby,"Question mark, exclamation point, quotation marks, brackets, parentheses, braces  and ellipses."
2622,c.j.,Ooh.
2623,josh,Wow!
2624,toby,Do you call the raise sir?
2625,bartlet,"There are three words, and three words only in the English language that begin with  the letters DW."
2626,josh,This is a pretty good illustration of why we get nothing done.
2627,bartlet,Can anyone name them for me please?
2628,sam,Three words that begin with DW?
2629,bartlet,Yes.
2630,sam,Dwindle.
2631,bartlet,Yes.
2632,toby,Dwarf.
2633,bartlet,Yes.
2634,toby," C’mon Princeton. We’ve got dwindle, we’ve got dwarf. "
2635,bartlet,I see you five and raise you five by the way.
2636,toby,Dwarf... dwindle.
2637,leo,Fold.
2638,josh,Fold.
2639,c.j.,Last card down.
2640,bartlet,"“Witches brew a magic spell, in an enchanted forest where fairies...”"
2641,toby,"Dwell! Dwell, dwell! Dwindle, dwarf and dwell!"
2642,bartlet,"Well, the answer’s correct but let’s check with our judges and -- oh no, I’m sorry,  time’s expired."
2643,toby,What? What time?
2644,bartlet,My time.
2645,josh,You have your own time?
2646,toby,I call.
2647,bartlet,Trip nines.
2648,toby,"Take your money sir. You’d dwell to report that to the I.R.S., report you as I will."
2649,leo,"All right, I’m done. I’m gonna head home."
2650,bartlet,Kiss Jenny for me.
2651,leo,"Yeah, I will."
2652,josh,"Sam, I’m going back to the office, they’ve got the commerce report ready for me.  What are you doing?"
2653,sam,I was gonna go home.
2654,josh,"Sam, I’m going back to the office, they’ve got the commerce report ready for me.  What are you doing?"
2655,sam,I’m going to go back to your office with you and make sure you understand the  commerce report.
2656,josh,Thank you.
2657,sam,When I get through with you you’re gonna know everything there is to know about  standard data versus sampling data in the census.
2658,bartlet,"Charlie, I’m headed over to the residence, you’re done for the night."
2659,bartlet,Don’t stay up too late son.
2660,c.j., How’d you do?
2661,c.j.,Most of that’s mine.
2662,josh,This is happening way too often.
2663,leo,It’s pledge week at the fraternities. The kids hop the fence.
2664,josh,This whole room is doors and windows.
2665,leo,Josh.
2666,josh,I’m cooperating. I’m cooperating.
2667,bartlet,All right.  What body of water in South America is formed by the  confluence...?
2668,toby,Excuse me Wink Martindale? Do you really think this is the time?
2669,bartlet,Not quite up on your South American geography are you my friend?
2670,bartlet,Saved by the bell.
2671,toby,"Cathy, I need a copy of Article 1, Section 2."
2672,toby,The Constitution.
2673,toby,Does anybody have a copy of the Constitution?  This is discouraging.
2674,toby,Oh for crying out loud! Try Amazon.COM. If they don’t have it then just bust into  the glass display case at the National Archives!
2675,c.j., You shouldn’t yell.
2676,toby,"Is it still in print, is what my staff would like to know."
2677,c.j.,I’m here to see Sam.
2678,toby,Go ahead.
2679,c.j.,"It’s not a big deal, I’m just, you know, here to see him about something."
2680,toby,What do I care?
2681,c.j.,Absolutely no reason that you should.
2682,toby,Okay.
2683,sam, Hey.
2684,c.j.,Hey. That was all great... what you just said there. 
2685,sam,What’d I just say?
2686,c.j.,"Not so much what you said, but the way you said it. "
2687,sam,The census has to be taken seriously.
2688,c.j.,Tell me about it.
2689,sam,"You know... It’s not glamorous, but you know."
2690,c.j.,Sure.
2691,sam,You need something?
2692,c.j.,Did you get a haircut?
2693,sam,No.
2694,c.j.,You look good today.
2695,sam,Thank you. You too.
2696,c.j.,New suit?
2697,sam,No.
2698,c.j.,You look good.
2699,sam,What do you need C.J.?
2700,c.j.,A tutor.
2701,sam,A tutor?
2702,c.j.,Yes.
2703,sam,What for?
2704,c.j.,"Sam, I read my briefing book last night on the commerce bill regarding the census  and there are certain parts of it I don’t understand."
2705,sam,I can help you out. Which parts?
2706,c.j.,Well... all of it.
2707,sam,All of it?
2708,c.j.,Yes.
2709,sam,You don’t understand the census?
2710,c.j.,I don’t understand certain nuances.
2711,sam,Like what?
2712,c.j.,"Like, the census."
2713,sam,"C.J., we’ve been working on this commerce bill for three weeks, I hear you talk  about the census all the time."
2714,c.j.,Yeah. Yeah.
2715,sam,Well...I don’t understand. How could you-?
2716,c.j.,I’ve been faking it.
2717,sam,You’ve been faking it?
2718,c.j.,"I’ve been playing it fast and loose there’s no doubt about it, but sitting in on  some of the meetings we’ve been having, and reading the briefing book last night,  I have to say that the census is starting to sound to me like it’s, well, important."
2719,sam,Ah-ha.
2720,c.j.,"And, I’ve come to the realization that if I’m gonna be talking about it all week,  it’s probably best that I understand what I’m saying."
2721,sam,When?
2722,c.j.,When what?
2723,sam,When did you come to this realization?
2724,c.j.,About an hour ago.
2725,sam,"Okay. Let’s... I tell you what, let’s forget the fact that you’re coming a little  late to the party and embrace the fact that you showed up at all."
2726,c.j.,That’s what I say.
2727,sam,Let’s try it at lunch.
2728,c.j.,Thank you.
2729,sam,You’ve been faking it?
2730,c.j.,Yes.
2731,sam,To the President?
2732,c.j.,I know. I probably shouldn’t do that.
2733,sam,You think?
2734,c.j.,I’ll see you at lunch.
2736,josh,Hi. 
2738,josh,About what?
2740,josh,Go ahead.
2742,josh,It’ll actually shake out to about 32 billion.
2744,josh,"Well, you know what they say?"
2746,josh,"A billion dollars here, a billion dollars there. Sooner or later it starts to add  up to real money."
2748,josh,I didn’t coin it or anything.
2750,josh,Yes.
2752,josh,Yes.
2754,josh,Yes.
2756,josh,‘Cause we’re Democrats.
2758,josh,Sure it is. It’s right there in our bank account. 
2760,josh,Isn’t it great?
2762,josh,Sorry.
2764,josh,I didn’t think so.
2765,leo,Twelve million dollars to establish an Appalachian transportation institute. 1.5  million to study parking facilities at commercial truck stops. Three million dollars  to produce a documentary on highway infrastructure. These are just some of today’s  additions to the Appropriations Bill. And that’s just in the area of transportation.
2766,leo,"By the way, the FAA doesn’t know what that is!"
2767,toby,"550,000 dollars for New York State to restore the home of Susan B. Anthony."
2768,josh,"While we’re at it, the tile in my shower could use re-grouting."
2769,toby,"Power zones, US rail, and Federal funding for 100,000 new public school teachers."
2770,leo,How’s this working?
2771,leo,Swing votes in terms of the census?
2772,leo,Who’s the third?
2773,leo,"You said three swing votes... Gladman, Skinner..."
2774,toby,Janice Willis’ husband.
2775,leo,Right.
2776,toby,Presumably he’s gonna do what he’s told.
2777,leo,You sure?
2778,toby,Tomorrow’s the start of a three-day weekend and 435 congressmen want to make their  flights home in the morning.
2779,leo,You think that’ll do it?
2780,toby,"Oh, I know that’ll do it."
2781,leo,What time’s the meeting?
2782,toby,11 o’clock.
2783,leo,Just don’t do anything to screw up or in any way embarrass me okay?
2784,josh,Leo. Knute Rockne. Sometimes I get them mixed up. 
2785,leo,Go.
2786,bartlet,What tripped the alarm?
2787,bartlet,She?
2788,bartlet,It wasn’t a fraternity stunt?
2789,bartlet,"Well, you know, just trying to kill me isn’t necessarily evidence of being mentally  unbalanced!"
2790,bartlet,I wasn’t?
2791,bartlet,Who was?
2792,bartlet,Zoey?
2793,bartlet,Leo.
2794,leo, Good morning Mr. President.
2795,bartlet,You know Ron Butterfield?
2796,leo,Sure.
2797,bartlet,He says it was a woman!
2798,leo,We spoke last night.
2799,leo,I’ll get a report first thing?
2800,bartlet,Of course.  This woman was after Zoey?
2801,leo,There were eight security checks between where the woman was and Zoey’s bedroom.
2802,bartlet,There’s no need for Zoey to know about this right? 
2803,leo,No.
2804,bartlet,What do you need?
2805,leo,"This may be the wrong time Mr. President, but I wanted to speak to you about... As the game was breaking up last night, you mentioned I should say hello to Jenny."
2806,bartlet,Hang on a second. What’ve you got Ron?
2807,bartlet,"Well, I guess that’s something."
2808,leo,You’ll send the full report?
2809,bartlet, You were saying?
2810,leo,It can wait.
2811,bartlet,You sure?
2812,leo,Yeah. Good seeing you Ron.
2813,leo,I’ll see you in an hour sir.
2814,bartlet, I guess we’re done too.
2815,bartlet,"No, no."
2816,bartlet,You too.  Ron?
2817,bartlet,Did she have a gun?
2818,bartlet,Okay. Thank you.
2819,josh,Congressman.
2820,josh,Morning.
2821,josh,"No, we haven’t."
2822,josh,I know.
2823,josh,"We sure will, congressman."
2824,toby,"Morning. Everyone got fruit. Everyone got bagels. Good, good. Christopher, Anthony,  would you mind putting my copy of the Appropriations Bill on the table please.  Thank you Christopher, thank you Anthony, and thank you Cathy. Gentlemen, why don’t  we take our seats? Congressman Skinner, welcome. Congressman Gladman, always good  to have you here, sir. Congressman Willis, I was a great fan of your late wife."
2825,toby,"This represents the latest draft of the House Appropriations Bill. It is 7,000 pages  long, and weighs over 55 pounds. It includes 1.2 million dollars for a lettuce  geneticist in Salinas, California and 1.7 million dollars for manure handling in  Starkville, Mississippi."
2826,toby,Eight states will divide 5 million dollars to research the uses of wood.
2827,toby,I’m thinking of some uses for it right now.
2828,josh,We are. The White House just wanted to take this opportunity to point out that you’re  criminals and despots.
2829,josh,No problem.
2830,josh,"No, sadly it won’t. What will stop the President from signing the bill is the amendment  your committee is offering on the census."
2831,toby,"I would like to emphasize the long floor fight of it all, and remind you that I have  absolutely no conscience when it comes to exploiting the fact that you have non- refundable airline tickets for the weekend. With that in mind..."
2832,toby,Yes sir?
2833,toby,I’m sorry?
2834,toby," Good, then. Let’s talk."
2835,c.j.,And you’re gonna go slowly right?
2836,sam,Yes.
2837,c.j.,Pretend for the purposes of this conversation that I’m dumb.
2838,sam,Let me try to conjure an image of you as a stupid person.
2839,c.j.,You’re cracking wise. I’m coming to you exposed and vulnerable.
2840,sam,This is your office. I’m coming to you.
2841,c.j.,I meant symbolically.
2842,sam,Ah.
2843,c.j.,"I’m a person saying there’s something I do not know, will you teach me. It’s hard  to admit you don’t know something. That makes me submissive."
2844,sam,What is it exactly that you’re asking me to do?
2845,c.j.,I’m admitting to you that there are things I do not know.
2846,sam,And I’m telling you that I don’t think anybody would have any trouble imagining that  there are things you do not know.
2847,c.j.,Explain it to me.
2848,sam,The Constitution mandates that every ten years we count everybody.
2849,c.j.,Why?
2850,sam,"Because representation at the various levels of the government, federal, state and  municipal, is based on population. The only way to find out how many congressmen  California gets is to count the people in California. Got it?"
2851,c.j.,"Can I just say that if the briefing book had been written that clearly, I would have  easily understood?"
2852,sam,We’re not through yet.
2853,c.j.,Okay.
2854,sam,"The decennial census has always been done by a door-to-door head count. Some 950,000  professionals are hired. The process costs approximately 6.9 billion dollars. The  process is also very inaccurate. It tends to be significantly disadvantageous to  inner city populations, recent immigrant populations, and of course the homeless."
2855,c.j.,"You are a very good teacher, Sam. I want you to know that in this..."
2856,sam,Your time of vulnerability?
2857,c.j.,Yes. I appreciate it.
2858,sam,We’re not done yet.
2859,c.j.,Okay.
2860,leo,"Oh! Hey, baby!"
2861,leo,Can you stay long?
2862,leo,"Oh, you didn’t have to do that."
2863,leo,I’m really fine Mal.
2864,leo,I wanted Mom to have the house.
2865,leo,"Mallory, this thing with your mother and me... it’ll blow over."
2866,josh,Did he say what it was about?
2868,josh,You won’t spend it right.
2870,josh,"Let’s say your cut of the surplus is $700. I want to take your money, combine it  with everyone else’s money and use it to pay down the debt and further endow social  security. What do you want to do with it?"
2872,josh,See?
2874,josh,"The problem is, the DVD player you buy might be made in Japan."
2876,josh,We don’t trust you.
2878,josh,We’re Democrats.
2880,josh,You shouldn’t have voted for us.
2881,josh,Hey Charlie.
2882,josh,"Mrs. Landingham, I got a message he needed to see me? "
2883,bartlet, I’m on a conference call with the  postmaster general.
2884,josh,What’s it about?
2885,bartlet,I honestly couldn’t tell you.
2886,josh,Ah.
2887,bartlet,"Look, I want you to do me a favor."
2888,josh,Of course.
2889,bartlet,Take Charlie out for a beer tonight.
2890,josh,Take him out for a beer?
2891,bartlet,"Yeah. The kid has no life. You’re the only guy around here he knows at all. Take him  out for a couple of beers, you guys come back, we’ll all watch the vote in Leo’s office."
2892,josh,Sure.
2893,bartlet,"Good, thanks. Let me give you some cash."
2894,josh,"No sir, I don’t need-"
2895,bartlet, Don’t be silly.
2896,josh,I have money Mr. President. I’m fine.
2897,bartlet,You sure?
2898,josh,Yes sir.
2899,bartlet,"Truth be known, I don’t have any cash on me."
2900,josh,It’s fine.
2901,bartlet,I don’t carry cash anymore. I don’t carry keys either.
2902,josh,"Well, I wouldn’t think you’d need them sir."
2903,bartlet,How’s it going in there?
2904,josh,We’ll see.
2905,bartlet,I appreciate it.
2906,josh,Yes sir.  Charlie?
2907,josh,You got plans tonight?
2908,josh,You don’t have to sit with your sister?
2909,josh,Have a beer with me.
2910,josh,Tonight. We’ll go to a bar in Georgetown. We’ll speak as men do.
2911,josh,Yeah.
2912,josh,No... It’s fine.
2913,josh,Great.
2914,josh,"I’m a Fulbright scholar Mrs. Landingham. I don’t leer. Also, there’ll be plenty of  grad students there."
2915,josh,So I’ll come get you?
2916,josh,Great.
2917,josh,Hey.
2918,josh,Where?
2919,josh,How do you know I’m going out with Charlie?
2920,josh,The man is like a camp counselor.
2921,josh,Nope.
2922,josh,These are plans among men.
2923,josh,"There’s gonna be grad students there, can we keep that in mind?"
2924,josh,Fine.
2925,josh,Sam’s got enough going on in his life right now without you making a booty call.
2926,josh,Whatever.
2927,josh,"The President’s daughter, Chief of Staff’s daughter, a Georgetown bar and Sam.  What could possibly go wrong? "
2928,c.j.,What’s the problem with a straight head count?
2929,sam,Head counts have proven staggeringly inaccurate.
2930,c.j.,Why?
2931,sam,"How’re you gonna count the homeless? There’s a large and growing population of  people who don’t speak English. And there are plenty of people, particularly in  the inner city, who don’t want to answer questions when you knock on their door.  Plus it’s always been hard. Sampling, statisticians have told us, is a much more  effective way of getting a good census."
2932,c.j.,And what’s the legal argument?
2933,sam,The legal argument is it’s unconstitutional. The legal argument is it’s law.
2934,c.j.,"But if sampling’s really against the law, why would congress be trying to pass  legislation saying sampling’s against the law?"
2935,sam,You see how good it feels to understand what you’re talking about?
2936,c.j.,And you see I’m able to do it without being patronizing?
2937,sam,What happened to “You look good today?”
2938,c.j.,I got over it.
2939,josh, Sam?
2940,sam,Yeah.
2941,josh,I’m taking Charlie for a beer tonight before the vote. Zoey and Mallory are coming.
2942,sam,Sounds good.
2943,c.j.,I like beer.
2944,josh,If you want to come... I guess that’d be okay.
2945,c.j.,"Why, Josh, you’ve swept me off my feet."
2946,josh,Whatever. I’ll see you later. 
2947,toby,Sampling will give a count that bears a much greater relationship to reality and  will do it to the tune of 4 billion dollars less than a door-to-door head count.
2948,toby,"Every single expert, including the census bureau itself, which is a bipartisan  commission, has said sampling is better. "
2949,toby,We are aware of that.
2950,toby,I don’t think it is.
2951,toby,The article is arcane.
2952,toby,Let’s take a look at it.
2953,toby,Let’s take a look at it!
2954,toby,My staff managed to unearth a copy.
2955,toby,"Mandy, would you read please from Article 1 Section 2?"
2956,toby,"Still, in all it is the owner’s manual and we should read what it has to say!"
2957,toby,Actually that’s not what it says.
2958,toby,Mandy left out a few words. Didn’t she Mr. Willis? 
2959,toby,"Mr. Willis teaches 8th grade social studies, and Mr. Willis knows very well what the  article says. It says which shall be determined by adding the whole number of free  persons. And three fifths of all other persons. Three fifths of all other persons.  They meant you Mr. Willis. Didn’t they?"
2960,toby,"Mr. Willis, you are asking to enact a law, which will limit the ability of those  people who need to be counted the most, to be counted as people at all. And they’re  only refuge is the argument that Article 1, Section 2 is not arcane."
2961,toby,"Congressman, you are talking about tying up an Appropriations Bill-"
2962,toby,What sir?
2963,toby,Absolutely sir. It is your choice.
2964,toby,It got through whatever door was open to me.
2965,toby,Thank you gentlemen. Have a good weekend.
2966,toby, Go tell Leo. 
2967,toby,Mr. Willis?
2968,toby,"If you don’t mind me asking sir, what changed your mind?"
2969,toby,"Well, I know it wasn’t expediency sir. I was wondering what changed your mind?"
2970,toby,"Well thank you.  I’m smiling because, well, around here the merits of a  particular argument generally take a back seat to political tactics."
2971,toby,Yeah.
2972,toby,I was taking advantage of you sir.
2973,toby,"There are some things I did not mention. First of all, it is partisan. Second of all,  I’m not wild about the precedent. "
2974,toby,"What’s to stop us from saying we don’t need elections, we’ll just use polling data.  1150 people with the sampling error of plus or minus three will decide who runs the  country."
2975,toby,And?
2976,toby,I’m sorry I never got to know your wife sir.
2977,toby,Thank you. Thank you.
2978,toby,"Nothing to it. They call your name, you vote yea. "
2979,toby,Well good luck congressman.
2980,bartlet,Thanks.
2981,bartlet,Yeah. Sure.
2982,bartlet,Yes?
2983,bartlet,"I’ll take the call wherever I am when he calls, I guess."
2984,bartlet,I’m not adopting a tone. I’m just trying to get out of here.
2985,bartlet,I’m saying no. I just want to go home.
2986,leo, Mr. President?
2987,bartlet,Goodnight Mrs. Landingham.  I heard it’s done?
2988,leo,"Yeah. Commerce will leave the census amendment in committee. Appropriations will  pass, no problem."
2989,bartlet,Good. I’m headed over to the residence.
2990,leo,I needed to speak to you about something.
2991,bartlet,Sure.
2992,leo,I should have told you earlier but... I moved out of the house. Jenny’s asking me  for a divorce.
2993,bartlet,You’re kidding me?
2994,leo,No.
2995,bartlet,"Leo, you’re kidding me?!"
2996,leo,No!
2997,bartlet,What happened?
2998,leo,"Nothing happened, Mr. President. It’s just one of those..."
2999,bartlet,"Don’t tell me nothing happened, Leo. I know you. I know Jenny. Married couples  like you don’t just get divorced. Not cause nothing happened!"
3000,leo,Nothing happened! It’s not like that.
3001,bartlet,I want to talk to Jenny.
3002,leo,Feel free.
3003,bartlet,I don’t understand how this happened Leo. You and Jenny were happy!
3004,leo,Jenny was not happy.
3005,bartlet,Because you weren’t spending enough time with her? 
3006,leo,"Yes, but that’s not the..."
3007,bartlet,Marriage needs attention Leo. It can’t run on autopilot. Come on. It’s not your  prom date we’re talking about here. We’re talking about your family!
3008,leo,"Well, Mr. President thank you for pointing that out. I tried to squeeze in as much  time as I could between my wine-tasting club and running your White House."
3009,bartlet,You can’t blame this on me.
3010,leo,"I’m not blaming you for it sir. I’m not blaming anyone for it. It just happened,  these things happen."
3011,bartlet,When did it happen?
3012,leo,Two weeks ago.
3013,bartlet,And you’re just now telling me?
3014,leo,"Honestly, I know how you feel about Jenny. I thought you’d think that somehow you  were responsible for it, and you’d turn that guilt into an inappropriate anger  toward me, which frankly, I can live without right now.  I can’t imagine what made me think all that..."
3015,bartlet," Fix this, Leo."
3016,leo,It’s not as simple as that.
3017,bartlet,It IS as simple as that. You’re the man. Fix it. 
3018,leo,Mr. President...
3019,bartlet,Fix it.
3020,leo, Goodnight sir.
3021,bartlet,Goodnight Leo.
3022,sam,"My friend, of course you’re talking about...?"
3023,josh,Sam does she know...?
3024,sam,My special friend.
3025,c.j.,What special friend?
3026,josh, His special friend that Zoey can’t know about. 
3027,sam, Okay...She’s not a hooker. She’s a call girl. And how do you know about this?
3028,c.j.,How does Mallory know about that?
3029,sam,I told her.
3030,c.j.,You told our boss’ daughter that you slept with a call girl?
3031,sam,I didn’t know she was Leo’s daughter at the time. I thought she was a schoolteacher  who came in with her class.
3032,josh,So you thought you were telling a complete stranger that you slept with a call girl?
3033,sam," Accidentally slept with a call girl. Mallory, does your father know?"
3034,sam,"Zoey, does your father know?"
3035,sam,So this is gonna be a thing!
3036,sam,Ah...
3037,c.j.,She didn’t bring my grasshopper.
3038,josh,She didn’t?
3039,c.j.,No.
3040,josh,Maybe she just felt really stupid ordering it.
3041,c.j.,The grasshopper is a perfectly respectable...
3042,c.j.,I’ll get it.
3043,josh,What?
3044,josh,Got it.
3045,c.j.,Straight up.
3046,josh,Make sure they make it extra thick and green.
3047,c.j.,The President is a very protective father.
3048,josh," So, you having a good time tonight?"
3049,josh,Seems like you’re not really having a good time.
3050,c.j.,He’s having a good time!
3051,josh,Well...
3052,c.j.,"Charlie, you’re twice as smart as anyone in the room. "
3053,josh,Relax!
3054,c.j.,"See, you keep telling him to relax with this sense of urgency..."
3055,josh,I just want to make sure he’s having a good time tonight.
3056,c.j.,He’s having a good time! You relax!
3057,josh,I’m not being urgent.
3058,josh,"I wouldn’t say that there was urgency in my voice. I was simply asking if he was  having a good time, and suggesting that if he relaxed..."
3059,c.j.,"Well, maybe if you stopped pestering him like you were his great Aunt Ida..."
3060,c.j.,Do you see what I’m saying?
3061,josh,Why must you mock a perfectly natural brotherly instinct...?
3062,c.j.,"I’m not mocking it Josh, I’m saying maybe if you left the young man alone..."
3063,c.j., Josh?
3064,sam, Hey! What the hell is going on around here?
3065,sam,Kiss my ass. Zoey?
3066,sam,Charlie?
3067,sam,What?
3068,josh, How’s everybody doin’?
3069,josh,Excuse me?
3070,josh,"Oh, this is too good to be true."
3071,josh,"Yeah. You guys don’t realize it, but you’re having a pretty bad night."
3072,josh," Well, my work here is done."
3073,bartlet,What happened?
3074,bartlet,Did you do anything at all to provoke these guys? 
3075,bartlet,Were you flirting with them?
3076,bartlet,"Zoey, you flirt with guys."
3077,bartlet,So what were you doing?
3078,bartlet,What the hell were you doing drinking?
3079,bartlet,I’m gonna up your protection.
3080,bartlet,Yes.
3081,bartlet,Starting tomorrow.
3082,bartlet,Well you’ll have plenty of friends to walk you to class.
3083,bartlet,Zoey!
3084,bartlet,You’re getting this part of your life.
3085,bartlet,Oh please.
3086,bartlet,"Look, the Secret Service..."
3087,bartlet,"They are worried about me getting shot. I’m worried about me getting shot. But that  is nothing compared to how terrified we are of you. You scare the hell out of the  Secret Service Zoey, and you scare the hell out of me too. My getting killed would  be bad enough, but that is not the nightmare scenario. The nightmare scenario,  sweetheart, is YOU getting kidnapped. You go out to a bar or a party in some club,  and you get up to go to the restroom, somebody comes up from behind, puts their  hand across your mouth, and whisks you out the back door. You’re so petrified, you  don’t even notice the bodies of two secret service agents lying on the ground with  bullet holes in their heads. Then you’re whisked away in a car. It’s a big party  with lots of noise, and lots of people coming and going. And It’s a half hour  before someone says, “Hey where’s Zoey?” Another 15 minutes before the first phone  call. Another hour and a half before anyone even THINKS to shut down all the  airports. Now we’re off to the races. You’re tied to a chair in a cargo shack,  somewhere in the middle of Uganda. And I’m told that I have 72 hours to get Israel  to free 460 terrorist prisoners. So I’m on the phone pleading with Benjamin and  he’s saying, “I’m sorry Mr. President, but Israel simply does not negotiate with  terrorists, period. It’s the only way we can survive.” So now we’ve got a new  problem, because this country no longer has a commander in chief, it has a father  who’s out of his mind because his little girl is in a shack somewhere in Uganda  with a gun to her head. DO YOU GET IT?!"
3088,bartlet," I’m sorry I yelled sweetheart. Forgive me. Honey, I want you to have  your freedom and your youth. I want you to have common everyday experiences with  girls your own age. But don’t ever forget - this is a privilege, and it is an  experience that must be cherished beyond measure. And proper protection and  security, though at times I admit, it’s a drag, is never too high a price to pay."
3089,bartlet,It’s alright sweetheart. It’s alright.
3090,bartlet,"Goodnight, sweetheart. I love you."
3091,bartlet,Don’t get up!
3092,leo,Good evening Mr. President.
3093,bartlet,"Hi. Before, when I was being an idiot, there was something I forgot to say."
3094,leo,What?
3095,bartlet,I’m sorry.
3096,leo,Thank you.
3097,bartlet,I would like unanimous consent to revise and extend my remarks.
3098,leo,Without objection.
3099,bartlet,"I don’t know what the hell was the matter with me, Leo. If there’s anything I can  do to help, anything?"
3100,leo,Thanks.
3101,josh,"Let me tell you something, I could have taken the two guys on the left."
3102,sam,Those were my guys.
3103,josh,Which guys?
3104,sam,The guys on the left.
3105,josh,The guys on the left as you’re facing the bar?
3106,sam,"Yeah. No. No. So you’re me, and facing toward the bar? "
3107,josh,Right.
3109,josh,"Thank you, Donna. Defending virtue is hungry work."
3111,josh,"Ah, Donna?"
3113,josh,How much were the sandwiches?
3115,josh,I gave you a twenty!
3117,josh,That was nice. That was a little parable.
3119,sam,"Yeah, so those were my guys."
3120,josh,"Okay, there’s the one guy with the blonde hair?"
3121,sam,Facing away from the bar?
3122,bartlet,Josh?
3123,josh,Yes sir.
3124,bartlet,What were you doing taking my daughter out to a bar? 
3125,josh, You told me to sir.
3126,bartlet,I told you to take Charlie. When Zoey said she was going I just assumed you were  gonna go have malteds or something.
3127,josh,"Malteds, sir?"
3128,bartlet,Yes.
3129,josh,What is this? 'Our Town'?
3130,bartlet,Well anyway. Thank you for doing whatever it was you did.
3131,josh,"As a matter of fact, I didn’t do anything. But for what it’s worth I should tell  you that Charlie didn’t blink before he put his body between danger and Zoey."
3132,bartlet," Charlie? Sam, you come too please."
3133,bartlet," You know, I once played the stage manager in a production of Our Town."
3134,bartlet,"Charlie, you a good poker player?"
3135,bartlet,"Excellent, get your money out and take a seat."
3136,c.j., Is Josh being punished?
3137,bartlet,Punished? No.
3138,c.j.,May I ask why not?
3139,bartlet,Because I said so.
3140,bartlet,Good evening.
3141,bartlet,Good work both of you. You bought us some time.
3142,toby,I understand you all had a very interesting evening. 
3143,josh,Yes.
3144,toby,So did I.
3145,josh,What happened?
3146,toby,I met an unusual man.
3147,bartlet,"C.J., deal the cards."
3148,toby,He didn’t walk into the room with a political agenda. He didn’t walk in with his  mind made up. He genuinely wanted to do what he thought was best. He didn’t mind  saying the words I don’t know.
3149,c.j.,"I said I don’t know to Sam just this morning and I’d like to say I’m a better person  for it. By the way, I now know everything there is to know about the census. Go ahead, you can ask me anything."
3150,bartlet,How many people live in the United States?
3151,sam,There’s some material we haven’t covered yet.
3152,josh,"Come on, Toby. Sit down."
3153,toby,I just want to watch this.
3154,leo,We won it 40 votes ago.
3155,toby,I just want to hear this one.
3156,c.j.,The first lady will be wearing a Badgely Mischka silk Shantung gown with a beaded bodice.
3157,c.j.,"I believe she will be wearing shoes, yes."
3158,c.j.,Black suede and velvet with a Manolo Blahnik slides with a rhinestone and mother of  pearl toe buckle.
3159,c.j.,Gabriel Sanchez freshwater pearl necklace with tourmaline beads. I’m also told to inform  you she will be carrying a Christina Bomba silk pleated organdy drawstring evening bag. 
3160,c.j.,Mrs. Siguto will be wearing a traditional silk kegaya in dark purple with an overlay of  black silk lace. 
3161,c.j.,"Matching open-toe evening slippers. Her jewelry is by an artist from her birthplace,  which is Jakarta."
3162,c.j.,It is fashioned with rubies and gold. Anything else? 
3163,c.j.,"Man alive, do I love it when In Style magazine is issued press credentials. Mirabella  needed to know what kind of wine is being served with the fish course. So, it’s a good  thing I went to school for 22 years. "
3164,josh,What wine are we...?
3165,c.j.,It’s wine and you’ll drink it.
3166,josh,Okay.
3167,c.j.,What do you need?
3168,josh,Sarah is picking up speed and power and has now been classified as a class four system.  You might want to talk about preparations and contingencies.
3169,c.j.,Sure. What are we talking about?
3170,josh,Hurricane Sarah.
3171,c.j.,Sarah’s a hurricane.
3172,josh,Yes.
3173,c.j.,Where is it heading?
3174,josh,Georgia and parts of the Carolinas. 
3175,c.j.,When?
3176,josh,It will hit landfall by tonight. 
3177,c.j.,Is it serious?
3178,josh,Have you ever been in a hurricane?
3179,c.j.,No.
3180,josh,"Me neither, but they look pretty serious."
3181,sam,"Just so you know, they’ve voted to strike."
3182,c.j.,The teamsters?
3183,sam,Fifteen minutes ago. Leo’s putting them in a room.
3184,c.j.,When?
3185,sam,Now.
3186,c.j.,How long is it going to last?
3187,sam,"Till midnight. Taft-Hartley expires, that’s why they’re going to walk."
3188,c.j.,There’s a state dinner tonight.
3189,josh,We’ll make more food.
3190,c.j.,Josh...
3191,josh,Don’t worry about it.
3192,c.j.," Hey, did you know about the hurricane?"
3193,toby,Yeah.
3194,c.j.,Everybody but me?
3195,toby,"Listen, I want you to start preparing for something. There’s a situation in McClane."
3196,c.j.,Virginia?
3197,toby,Idaho.
3198,c.j.,What’s in Idaho?
3199,toby,"There’s a property there that local law enforcements had surrounded for four days.  A farmhouse, with anywhere from 18 to 40 Survivalists."
3200,c.j.,Are they armed?
3201,toby,Yeah.
3202,c.j.,Are there kids?
3203,toby,Yes.
3204,toby,"The F.B.I. decided it’s a hostage situation. So, we have ourselves a whole new ball game."
3205,c.j.,"So, let me see if I have this.  And the government’s planning a siege on 18 to 40 of its citizens,  all the while we host a state dinner for the President of Indonesia."
3206,sam,You got it.
3207,c.j.,"Amazingly, you know what I’ll get asked most often today? "
3208,josh,What?
3209,c.j.,Sondra?
3210,c.j.,Black suede and velvet. Manolo Blahnik slides with a rhinestone and mother of pearl  toe buckle.
3211,c.j.,No problem.
3212,josh,"Low-pressure system. It’s another low-pressure system. Okay, I’m talking to the Red  Cross. I’ll call you in about an hour... Yeah. Bye."
3213,josh,Donnatella Moss! 
3215,josh,"A senior Indonesian deputy is coming tonight. Toby and I want to talk to him alone  for a few minutes. I need you to find out if he can speak English and if he can’t,  we need to get an interpreter from State."
3217,josh,Ramahedi Sumahedjo Bambang.
3219,josh,"Not correctly, no. "
3221,josh,Yes.
3223,josh,What?
3225,josh,What’s the problem?
3227,josh,I wish you wouldn’t do that.
3229,josh,Because you tend to call some bizarre factoid from a less than reputable source and  then you blow it all out of proportion.
3231,josh,Donna...
3233,josh, What?
3235,josh,They... summarily execute people they suspect of being sorcerers?
3237,josh,Sorcerers.
3239,josh,A scythe.
3241,josh,"Well, thanks for the head’s up."
3243,josh,You bet. 
3244,leo,I heard it got upgraded. 
3245,josh,It’s a class 4 hurricane. FEMA’s down in Georgia with the Red Cross. The President  should be prepared to sign some sort of federal disaster relief. What’s going on with  the truckers?
3246,leo,I’m meeting with them in the Roosevelt Room in an hour.
3247,josh,C.J.’s going to need to know what they’re wearing.
3248,c.j.,Yeah.
3249,toby,What’s the issue?
3250,sam,Two tiered hiring. 
3251,leo,"A company divides its workforce into two bodies. Long term, full time employees,  who enjoy top market wages and benefits, and part time, or newer full time employees  who are paid a lower waged scale and usually get no benefits."
3252,c.j.,"But, they’re part time employees."
3253,josh,I’m with management.
3254,toby,A younger workforce puts a premium on job flexibility and they’re unwilling to make a  long time commitments to a single company. What do you expect?
3255,leo,"Listen. McClane, Idaho? I need someone to monitor and keep the President and me updated  throughout the day. "
3256,sam,I’ll do it.
3257,leo,You’re going to work with Toby on the toast.
3258,toby,Don’t need him.
3259,leo,"Yes, you do."
3260,sam,It takes two people to write a toast?
3261,leo,The State Department’s very particular about these toasts. 
3262,josh,I’ll assign someone from my office.
3263,josh,No. You can’t. 
3264,josh,"Because, you’re a political consultant and... this is an actual... you know... thing."
3265,josh,"I don’t think it will be the end of this administration, Leo. I think it will be the  end of this republic."
3266,leo,Establish a contact at the Justice Department and the FBI. And keep Josh informed  throughout the day and night. What else?
3267,josh, The... uh... Redskins suck.
3268,leo,Thank you. 
3269,toby,Donna?
3271,toby,Did Josh talk to you about the...?
3273,toby,Yeah.
3275,toby,Thank you. 
3277,toby,Yes.
3279,josh,You’re all crazy.
3280,c.j.,"No questions right now, Harry."
3281,bartlet,"She’s not worried about the length of your question, she’s worried about the length  of my response."
3282,bartlet,We’re having salmon tonight. 
3283,bartlet,They told you that?
3284,bartlet,Yo-yo Ma is going to play.  Do you like salmon?
3285,bartlet,Well... our mistake.
3286,toby,What do you have so far?
3287,sam,"Uh, we start by welcoming our friends and distinguished guests. We praise President  Siguto for leading his country through a period that promises profound change as  Indonesia moves from an authoritarian dictatorship towards a real democracy."
3288,toby,The beginnings of a real democracy.  Let’s not get carried away. 
3289,sam,All right. Ah... we have been friends for over 50 years...
3290,toby,Don’t... Don’t say friends. 
3291,sam,It’s a state dinner.
3292,toby,Fine. But I don’t think we should remind people how friendly we were with dictators  who oppressed their people while stealing their money.
3293,sam,How else are you going to steal people’s money?
3294,toby,"See, that’s good. Write that in the toast? "
3295,sam,Toby?
3296,toby,Yeah?
3297,sam,You got something going on tonight with Josh?
3298,toby,We got to see a guy about a thing.
3299,sam,Need any help?
3300,toby,No. Toughen this up.
3301,leo,"Thirty days with a federal mediator, you people couldn’t work this out?"
3302,leo,Name them.
3303,leo,Name them again.
3304,leo,"This is the White House, Bobby, it’s not the Jersey turnpike. Watch your mouth. "
3305,leo,"For all the danger your industry’s facing from competition, Seymour... the fact is,  the trucks are still this country’s number one way of moving things around. Including  food. I’m talking about produce rotting in warehouses. I’m talking about fistfights  in supermarkets over who gets the last bar of soap.  You have until midnight."
3306,josh,Why aren’t you in your own office?
3307,josh,There’s a reason for that.
3308,josh,Did they... refuse it politely?
3309,josh,Yes... that’s what I’m asking you. 
3310,josh,"Yes, but you shouldn’t take it personally. It bugs me when the President listens to  anyone who isn’t me."
3311,josh,Why?
3312,josh,You know that for sure?
3313,josh,"Yeah, I was wondering why that was. "
3314,josh,Yes. 
3315,josh,Yes.
3316,bartlet,She’d like you to say a little more on the subject. 
3317,bartlet,Okay.
3318,c.j.,One more question. Danny?
3319,bartlet,Which one?
3320,bartlet,"I try not to look out my window that much, Danny. What protestors? "
3321,bartlet,Vermeil?
3322,c.j.,"Danny, I’m going to cover vermeil at the briefing, that’s all folks, I got to bring  in the next group."
3323,bartlet,Thank you.
3324,c.j.,The protestors?
3325,c.j.,It’s about vermeil.
3326,c.j.,I happen to know what vermeil is. 
3327,c.j.,"My one o’clock briefing is going to be about the vermeil protestors, isn’t it?"
3328,c.j.,Thanks.
3329,c.j.,I need to know what vermeil is and why people are protesting it. 
3330,c.j.,Yes. 
3331,bartlet,Leo...
3332,leo,"Good morning, sir.   Sir, if I could..."
3333,bartlet,Absolutely.
3334,leo,Thank you. 
3335,bartlet," Excuse me, folks. "
3336,bartlet,"I can’t decide if that man is boring or rude, but he’s one or the other. "
3337,leo,I’m sorry to hear that.
3338,bartlet,"I’m sitting out there trying to figure out how this guy campaign for something  and win, then I remembered--we usually rig the elections. "
3339,leo,There you go.
3340,bartlet,You think it’s important he sit at my table tonight? 
3341,leo,"He’s the guest of honor, so it is customary."
3342,bartlet,Where are you sitting?
3343,leo,"At your table, sir."
3344,bartlet,Where’s Toby sitting?
3345,leo,With C.J. and Josh and Sam.
3346,bartlet,"Ah, that’s the fun table. "
3347,leo,Yeah.
3348,bartlet,What do you need?
3349,leo,I just wanted to let you know that we’re going to clear out a battle carrier group  from the Norfolk Naval Yard.
3350,bartlet,Because of the hurricane?
3351,leo,Yes. It’s standard procedure. They want to get the ships out of the way. 
3352,bartlet,"All right, fine."
3353,leo,And this is just in case someone asks you why we deployed an entire group in the  North Atlantic.
3354,bartlet,Sorry to keep you waiting.  Did I mention we’re having salmon tonight?
3355,toby,Read this. 
3356,sam,“Indonesia’s constitution highlights democratic principles.” Toby...
3357,toby,Read.
3358,sam,I know what you’re gearing up for.
3359,toby,Read!
3360,sam," “The national ideology of Pancasila, upon which, your constitution is founded,  includes a belief in the Supreme Being, while calling for religious tolerance.”  I see you’ve underlined that. “Freedom of the press, freedom of assembly...”  Toby, do you think it a good idea to invite people to dinner and then tell them  exactly what they’re doing wrong with their lives?"
3361,toby,"Absolutely, otherwise it’s just a waste of food. "
3362,sam,Toby...
3363,toby,We’re not telling them how to run their lives. 
3364,sam, “It’s time for your government to live up to the promises enshrined  in the hearts and minds of your people as well as the laws of your land?”
3365,toby,Friendly reminder.
3366,sam,Can we soften the top of this?
3367,toby,No.
3368,sam,"Something like... “As has often been said, a true friend tells another friend the  truth and on some issues, we must speak candidly, or we could not, in all honesty,  hold the great honor of being known the world over as Indonesia’s friend.” "
3369,toby,Well... that was just about the worst writing I have ever heard.
3370,sam,I know. 
3371,c.j.,Vermeil is gilded silver. Silver covered in gold. The White House has one of the  largest collections in the world. 
3372,c.j.,"Well, these are 18th and 19th century French objects. Many designed by the noted  European silversmith, Jean-Baptiste Claude Odiot."
3373,c.j.,The collection is kept in the Gold Room along with the ten-arm glass cut chandelier  which was made in England in 1785. 
3374,c.j.,Nothing at all. It’s just interesting information and I thought I’d share it with you.
3375,c.j.,"Many workers were blinded by the mercury while making these pieces. Louis the 15th  would melt them down to pay for his wars against his people. So, in general, they’re  seen in some circles as a symbol of a government’s bloody and tyrannical oppression  of its own people. We use them as centerpieces with a seasonal floral arrangement."
3376,c.j.," I’ll be honest with you, Tom. I haven’t run this by the President  yet, but I’ll have that for you, plus the rest of the day’s scores and highlights at the  next briefing at 4:00 or 5:00. Thank you. "
3377,c.j.,I won’t need a transcript of that.
3378,c.j.,"You’re a rabble rouser, you know that? You rouse rabbles."
3379,c.j.,I went and looked at your big vermeil demonstration. Six people in Lafayette Park  with oak tag and magic markers. 
3380,c.j.,Six people! Six pathetic people protesting on a Friday and you just lent their weak  and feeble voices a megaphone. What do you call that?
3381,c.j.,You’re very proud of yourself. 
3382,c.j.,What am I wearing tonight?
3383,c.j.,Your paper wants to know what I’m wearing?
3384,c.j., You want to know what I’m wearing?
3385,c.j., Well... I’m wearing... an evening gown of... gray silk.
3386,c.j.,"Well, okay. I got to go deal with the vermeil crazies. "
3387,c.j.,Okay. 
3388,sam,The point I was trying to make to Toby was that this toast is coming at the end of two  days of policy talks. And maybe at dinner we could lighten it up.
3389,sam,Should I sit quietly?
3390,sam,No problem. 
3391,sam,I’ll eat my sandwich.
3392,sam,I’m having a hard time deciding between the ham and cheese and the chicken salad. 
3393,sam,"Yeah, but this kind of environment is basically community food, right?"
3394,sam,Because of the way you’re dressed?
3395,sam,No. 
3396,sam,Your night job’s crummy.
3397,sam,"So, you got a thing tonight? A date?"
3398,sam,Yeah.
3399,sam,Who?
3400,sam,I was just...
3401,sam,Yes.
3402,sam,Where’s he taking you?
3403,sam,Okay.
3404,sam,Is this...?
3405,sam,"Oh, for God’s sakes, it’s Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 US 335. You cite the precedent.  You cite Black’s opinion for the majority."
3406,sam,And I’d like you to learn my experience when I tell you that law school bears little  relationship to the practice of law.
3407,sam,Yes.
3408,sam,I’m just saying. Your night job stinks.
3409,sam,And I’m taking your sandwich.
3410,bartlet,"No, of course not."
3411,josh,"Excuse me, Mr. President. These people aren’t thumbing through Hustler. They’re armed.  They’re evading arrest and they’re holding hostages."
3412,bartlet,You want to raid this house?
3413,leo,Josh?
3414,josh,There’s no way this’ll end good. All that’s left is to end it fast.
3415,leo,I agree.
3416,josh,"This is a stand off with federal officers. A peaceful settlement is “put your guns down,  you’re under arrest.”"
3417,bartlet,"All right, Mandy. Thank you. Josh? Would you two give us a minute, please?"
3418,josh,I don’t think it’s unreasonably macho for the White House to be aggressive in preserving  democracy.
3419,josh,"This isn’t abstract, Mandy. This isn’t a theoretical problem. The FBI says come out with  your hands up, you come out with your hands up. At which point, you’re free to avail  yourself of the entire justice system."
3420,leo,"Mandy, the President’s going to go with your plan. Chafey’s going to send in a negotiator. "
3421,josh,"Well, you’re in the game now."
3423,josh,"Well, prudent or not, once the scythe comes out, I’m probably going to haul ass."
3424,josh,What’s up?
3425,josh,What do you need?
3426,josh,Are they evacuated?
3428,josh,"Don’t worry about it. Donna, call FEMA, use my name. When that doesn’t work, use Leo’s name. "
3429,josh,We’ll find them. 
3430,josh,"I look good tonight, don’t you think? "
3431,josh,"You look good too, but I look even better."
3432,josh,Yeah?
3433,josh,I really don’t know.
3434,josh,I don’t have any thoughts on it one-way or the other.
3435,josh,I don’t know.
3436,josh,Not that I’m aware of.
3437,josh,It’s never really been made clear to me. 
3438,josh,Toby!
3439,sam,He’s not here.
3440,josh,Hey.
3441,sam,"We look good, don’t we? "
3442,sam,"Hey, I’m finishing up this speech... Do you think there’s some sort of personal  connection between President Siguto and the U.S.? You know, something from his past?"
3443,josh,He was once almost pushed out of an airplane by a CIA trained operator. 
3444,sam,I should probably leave that out.
3445,josh,Yeah. I would.
3446,toby,"Excuse me, Josh?"
3447,josh,Hey.
3448,toby,Can I speak with you a moment?
3449,josh,Is he in? 
3450,toby,Yes.
3451,josh,Let’s go.
3452,toby,There’s a problem.
3453,josh,What?
3454,toby,Mr. Minaldi!
3455,toby,This is Mr. Minaldi. The interpreter from State.
3456,josh,"You do speak Indonesian, don’t you?"
3457,josh, Donna!
3459,josh,"It’s 7:30, is there anyone left at state?"
3461,josh,"Then, what are we doing?"
3463,toby,Where does that get us?
3465,toby,Wait a minute... ah... Why can’t the kitchen guy translate Batak into English?
3467,toby,You’re kidding me.
3469,toby,Is the bar open yet?
3471,toby,Make this work. 
3473,c.j.,Excuse me. Have you seen the First Lady?
3475,c.j.,"Good evening, Mrs. Bartlet."
3477,c.j.,"Yes, ma’am. "
3479,c.j.,Nice to meet you all.
3481,c.j.,"Thank you, Mrs. Bartlet. "
3482,c.j.,Abbey?
3484,c.j.,I appreciate the thought.
3486,c.j.,I spoke to Peggy about the vermeil. You might get a few questions.
3488,c.j.,"Yes, but it’s history. "
3490,c.j.,"Okay, well. Good answer."
3492,c.j.,"Yes, ma’am."
3494,c.j.,"Yes, ma’am. "
3496,leo,Fred Astaire.
3498,leo,He was caught on a call. He’ll meet you over there.
3500,leo,They’ve been at it for ten hours.
3502,leo,We’ll be okay.
3506,leo,"Guys... shmooze someone for me. His name’s Carl Everett, and he’s raised a ton of money  for us in the Midwest. Carl? I’d like you to meet..."
3507,toby,Our reputations precede us.
3508,leo,"Excuse me, gentlemen. "
3509,sam,"So, how long are you in town for, Mr. Everett?"
3510,josh,Josh Lyman.  
3511,sam, Sam Seaborn. 
3512,sam,Great.
3513,josh,Have a good time.
3514,josh,Okay.
3518,c.j.,Leo.
3519,leo,What’s happening?
3520,c.j.,It’s a whole new situation. 
3521,leo,It’s moving east. It’s moving back out. What kind of situation?
3522,c.j.,"For some reason, there’s a fleet of ships out there."
3523,leo," Oh, God..."
3524,c.j.,Do you know about this?
3525,leo,They evacuated a battle carrier group out of Norfolk this morning as a standard  safety precaution.
3526,c.j.,They’re sitting right in the path of the hurricane.
3527,leo,Can they get out?
3528,c.j.,"Leo, the thing is 600 miles across. They’re locked in. How bad can this get?"
3529,leo,Catastrophic.
3530,c.j.,What do you want to do?
3531,leo,"Let’s do this thing, and then get ready."
3532,c.j.,I should start to work now.
3533,leo,Ah. I don’t want to tip the press. Let’s go to a party. 
3534,josh,"Yeah, okay... I appreciate your call. Thank you. "
3535,josh,It’s over.
3536,josh,"That was Chafey. They took the house. 34 occupants, they’re all in custody. "
3537,josh,They shot the FBI negotiator. He’s in critical condition.
3538,josh,Mandy?
3539,bartlet,Without warning?
3540,leo,Yeah.
3541,bartlet,The hurricane just shifted direction without any warning?
3542,leo,"It’s not an anomaly, but it’s unusual."
3543,bartlet,I would think.
3544,bartlet,Captain? How big is this carrier group? How many men and how many ships?
3545,bartlet,How soon before the worst of it starts?
3546,bartlet,Is there any way I can speak with the fleet commander? 
3547,bartlet,All right. Let’s do it.
3548,bartlet,Thank you.
3549,bartlet,Any word on the FBI guy’s condition?
3550,leo,They’re prepping him for surgery.
3551,bartlet,What do I do now?
3552,leo,Go back to the party.
3553,toby,Mr. Gomez... 
3554,toby,"Mr. Gomez, you speak Batak. Is that correct?"
3555,toby,"As you just did, you also speak Portuguese?"
3556,toby,But not English?
3557,toby,"Okay. Those are two pretty tough languages, Batak and Portuguese... you might want to  take a crack at English one day, seeing as how you live here. Okay?"
3558,toby," Mr. Bambang, thank you for agreeing to meet with me today."
3559,toby,Okay.
3560,josh,Sorry I’m late. I’m Josh Lyman.
3561,toby,This is going to take a while.
3562,josh,Are you enjoying the evening?
3563,toby,"Josh, this isn’t the best context for chit-chat. "
3564,josh,Mandy is pretty upset. I didn’t do a great job. 
3565,toby,He’s answering a question from like a half hour ago. Mr. Bambang? 
3566,josh,Donna... 
3568,toby,Yes.
3570,josh,Yes.
3572,toby,"Yes. Mr. Gomez, Mr. Minaldi, thank you for your trouble."
3573,toby, A friend of mine is in one of your jails. I want you to let him out. 
3574,toby,He’s French.
3575,toby,Because he’s my friend and the French don’t give a damn.
3576,josh,We’re not talking about the extradition process. 
3577,toby,"What we’re talking about is that you unlock the cell, you put him in a car, and you  drive him to the border."
3578,toby,That’s what he does. He teaches students how to protest. 
3579,toby,Yes.
3580,toby,Yes.
3581,toby," Please understand that with so many people watching... with so much media coverage...  it was important for us to make clear that the United States, with it’s commitment to  human rights..."
3582,toby,"Yes, it does. "
3583,josh,We’ll talk to the French.  Toby. We’ll  talk to the French.
3584,toby,Yeah.
3585,c.j.,You’re not supposed to be back here right now.
3586,c.j.,We’ll have a statement in 15 minutes.
3587,c.j.," Danny, did you hear me say we’ll have a statement in  15 minutes? God, Danny."
3588,c.j.,"When you flirt with me, are you doing it to get a story?"
3589,c.j.,Why are you doing it?
3590,c.j., I don’t believe you.
3591,c.j.,So?
3592,c.j.,Look...
3593,c.j.,You know what? You’re the one who goes around town saying that I’m too friendly with  the press corps and that makes me a weak press secretary.
3594,c.j.,"Yeah, but you’ve been thinking it."
3595,c.j.,See? You’re doing it.
3596,c.j.,I have work to do.
3597,c.j.,You really like the dress?
3598,c.j.,All right. Whatever.
3599,c.j.,15 minutes.
3600,bartlet,How are we doing?
3601,bartlet,Hungry?
3602,bartlet,Tired?
3603,bartlet,Talk to me for five minutes apiece and then we’re going to settle this. 
3604,bartlet,Stay standing.
3605,sam,Carl. Brittany.
3606,sam,Sure. 
3607,sam,Sure.
3608,sam,You want to have a relationship with me?
3609,sam,I cost $500 an hour.
3610,sam,In the private sector. I billed out at $500 an hour.
3611,sam,Would you like some of my food?
3612,sam,What were you thinking?
3613,sam,He just tells you what to wear.
3614,sam,That’s great.
3615,sam, Thank you. 
3616,sam,No. Could you keep talking about being here and not being here until blood starts  pouring out of my ears?
3618,sam,"Mrs. Bartlet, good evening."
3620,sam,Yes.
3622,sam,Yes?
3624,sam,Okay.
3627,sam,He had to step out to the West Wing.
3629,sam,"I’m not sure why, but I could..."
3631,sam,Why would he?
3634,sam,"Yes, ma’am."
3635,sam,"I’m just going to eat, if that’s okay."
3636,sam,"I’ll give you $10,000 not to go home with that guy tonight."
3637,bartlet,Time’s up.
3638,bartlet,"Yes, I know. But I got tired of listening to you. Now you listen to me. I have a Nobel Prize  in Economics and I’m here to tell you that none of you know what the hell you’re talking  about. At 12:01 am, I’m using my executive power to nationalize the trucking industry."
3639,bartlet,Fourteen White House lawyers disagree. Truman did it in ‘52 with the coalmine.
3640,bartlet,"In 50 years, there’s a new bench and I’ll take my chances. As for Labor, I am calling  Congress into Emergency Session to grant me the authority to draft the truckers into  military service. You’re going to love our food. Nice talking to you folks. If this  isn’t settled in 47 minutes, don’t worry. We know where to find you. "
3642,bartlet,Hey... I’m all right. 
3644,bartlet,I approved a plan for an FBI negotiator.
3646,bartlet,He’s in surgery now.
3648,bartlet,"What the hell? Well, if this isn’t a metaphor for powerlessness, I don’t know what is.  We better get back to work, huh?"
3649,leo,Mr. President...
3650,bartlet,We got the fleet commander?
3651,leo,Not yet. The JFK’s radios have been knocked out along with communications on the Normandy  and the South Carolina. All we’ve got is the Hickory. It’s a little maintenance and supply  boat that sails around with the fleet.
3652,bartlet,"So, I guess I’m going to talk to the Captain of the Hickory?"
3653,josh,"The intercom’s been knocked out. They’re looking for him on foot, sir."
3654,bartlet,Is there somebody on there now? 
3655,leo,The kid in the radio shack.
3656,bartlet,You’re kidding.
3658,bartlet,Hello?  Hello? Anyone there?
3659,bartlet,"Hickory, this is the White House. Who am I speaking to?"
3660,bartlet,Son? This is President Bartlet.  Hello?
3661,bartlet,Is your C.O. around?
3662,bartlet,Can I talk to you in the meantime?  Hello?
3663,bartlet,"Are you all right, Harold?"
3664,bartlet,Are you bleeding?
3665,bartlet,Can you put something on it?
3666,bartlet,You go over and get it. I’ll stay right here.
3667,bartlet,"Harold?  Harold, are you back?"
3668,bartlet,Can you tell us what’s going on?
3669,bartlet,Harold?
3670,bartlet,We’re here.
3671,bartlet,Can you tell us what’s going on?
3672,bartlet,"Well, I don’t know, man. Sounds pretty bad, Harold. I think I’m going to ask for my  money back.  Harold?"
3673,bartlet,"I’m going to stay right here, as long as the radio works, okay?"
3674,bartlet,Hang on.
3675,bartlet,"Yellowstone, established by an act signed by Ulysses S. Grant was the nation’s first  national park - March 1, 1872."
3676,josh," It’s getting late, sir. I was wondering, are we through for the evening?"
3677,bartlet," Well, we’re through with work, Josh, but this part’s fun."
3678,josh,"What part, sir?"
3679,bartlet,"The part where I get you to sit down, and teach you a little something."
3680,josh, Ah.
3681,bartlet,Yeah.
3682,josh,"You’re not tired, sir?"
3683,bartlet,No.
3684,josh,"Perhaps, if you get into bed and..."
3685,bartlet,"I’m a national park buff, Josh."
3686,josh,"I’m sorry, sir?"
3687,bartlet, I said I’m a national park buff. I bet you didn’t know that about me.
3688,josh,"Well, I didn’t know that about you, sir, but I’m certainly not surprised."
3689,bartlet,Why is that?
3690,josh,"You’re... quite a nerd, Mr. President."
3691,bartlet,Really?
3692,josh,"Yes, sir."
3693,bartlet,I assume that was said with all due respect.
3694,josh,"Yes, sir."
3695,bartlet," Is it nerd-like to know that Everglades National Park  is the largest remaining subtropical wilderness in the continental United States,  AND has extensive mangrove forests?"
3696,josh,"Just a little bit. Yes, sir."
3697,bartlet,"There are 54 national parks in the country, Josh."
3698,josh,Please tell me you haven’t been to all of them.
3699,bartlet,I HAVE been to all of them. I should show you my slide collection.
3700,josh,"Oh, would you?"
3701,bartlet," Grand Canyon, Bryce Canyon, Badlands, Capitol Reef, Acadia,  which is so often overlooked..."
3702,josh,"You should certainly feel free to keep talking, but I need to go home so I could be back  in my office in four hours."
3703,bartlet,Dry Tortugas...
3704,josh,"See, the thing is, I can’t leave without your permission."
3705,bartlet,"Petrified Forests, North Cascades, Joshua Tree, Shenandoah National Park, right here  in Virginia! "
3706,josh,Good a place as any to dump your body.
3707,bartlet,What was that?
3708,josh,Did I say that out loud?
3709,bartlet,"See, and I was gonna let you go home."
3710,josh,But instead?
3711,bartlet,We’re gonna talk about Yosemite.
3712,leo,"Thanks, Tony. Hang on."
3713,leo,"Yeah, but this is my hotel."
3714,leo,"How much does a cup of coffee cost here, Tony?"
3715,leo, You want to pay the check?
3716,leo, Thanks.
3717,leo,Yes... You haven’t told me about your mom.
3718,leo,Tell me about her.
3719,leo,Congressman Skinner!
3720,leo,"Thank you. You know my daughter, Mallory."
3721,leo,To all of us.
3722,leo,Yeah.
3723,leo,Yeah.
3724,leo,Thank you. You haven’t told me about your mother.
3725,leo,Is she...  I don’t know. Tell me anything.
3726,leo,"Yeah, or I could just ask you."
3727,leo,I’m beginning to get that impression. 
3728,leo,Opera tickets. It’s our subscription night.
3729,leo,No.
3730,leo,Yes.
3731,leo,"I had an opportunity to give you up for adoption, you know."
3732,leo,Why couldn’t you say congratulations?
3733,leo,Yes.
3734,leo,"Please, Mallory. You were... I don’t know, you were smirking..."
3735,leo,...or rolling your eyes...
3736,leo,You were doing it with your voice.
3737,leo, You want the tickets?
3738,leo,You want to walk me back to work?
3739,c.j.,Till two in the morning?
3740,c.j.,They were talking till two in the morning?
3741,bartlet,We beat the Banking Lobby!
3742,c.j.,It’s gonna pass?
3743,bartlet,We beat them.
3744,c.j.,You’re confident?
3745,bartlet,Yep. It’s in the bag.
3746,c.j.,Were you and Josh talking ‘til two in the morning about national parks?
3747,bartlet,"Ooh, C.J., Everglades National Park is one of the biggest..."
3748,bartlet,Right. I got to take this call so I can gloat about the Banking Bill.
3749,c.j.,"Enjoy yourself, sir."
3750,bartlet,Be talking about this C.J. This is the story!
3751,c.j.,"Yes, sir."
3752,bartlet, Crunch them!
3753,c.j.,"Yes, sir."
3754,bartlet," Oh, incidentally, the California Live Oak is the..."
3755,bartlet,Right.
3756,c.j.,"Have a good day, sir."
3757,bartlet,"Twelfth round knockout, C.J.! "
3758,c.j.,"Yes, sir."
3759,bartlet,"This is the saddest looking cabinet I have ever... look at this. I have an agriculture  secretary who hasn’t eaten a vegetable in his life. Everybody sit down. You’re freaking  me out. Good morning, Leo."
3760,bartlet,Hello. Are you taking minutes?
3761,bartlet,What’s your name?
3762,bartlet,Mildred? I’m Josiah Bartlet. I’m the President of the United States. 
3763,bartlet,What did I miss?
3764,bartlet,"Uh, would you skip down, please?"
3765,bartlet,"Actually, I find these meeting to be a fairly mind-numbing experience, but Leo assures  me that they are Constitutionally required, so let’s get it over with. Proceed, Mildred."
3766,bartlet,Who said that?
3767,bartlet,Our first goal should be finding a way to work with Congress?
3768,bartlet,You don’t think our first goal is should be finding a way to best serve the American People?
3769,bartlet,"Really? Let’s have a look.  Yeah, that’s what it says right here. Would you like Mildred to read it back again?"
3770,bartlet,Okay. Anything else?
3771,bartlet,Good. Now let’s get to work.
3772,toby,It’s good.
3773,sam,Yeah.
3774,toby,It’s good.
3775,sam,Yeah.
3776,toby,It’s a little flat.
3777,sam,"I think so, too."
3778,toby,My writing’s been a little flat lately.
3779,sam,It’s not you. It’s me.
3780,toby,"Well, you did the best you could."
3781,sam,What do you mean?
3782,toby,You reached your potential here.
3783,sam,"No, I didn’t. I can do better than this."
3784,toby,I can do better than this.
3785,sam,Are you saying I can’t do better than this?
3786,toby,"I’m saying you’re fine, and I’m flat."
3787,josh, What’s going on?
3788,toby,We’re having difficulty locating our talent.
3789,josh,Are you hearing anything about the Banking Bill?
3790,toby,What do you mean?
3791,josh,I don’t know. I’m hearing some stuff.
3792,toby,"No, we’re fine."
3793,josh,You sure?
3794,toby,Yeah. I’m having lunch with Crane.
3795,josh,When?
3796,toby,Lunchtime.
3797,josh,I shouldn’t be nervous?
3798,toby,No.
3799,josh,Okay. 
3800,toby,"Alright... It couldn’t have gone far, right?"
3801,sam,No.
3802,toby,Somewhere in this building... is our talent.
3803,sam, Yes.
3804,c.j.,Danny. 
3805,c.j.,How is it my staff just lets you walk in here?
3806,c.j.,They’re supposed to like me.
3807,c.j.,What do you need?
3808,c.j.,From who?
3809,c.j.,Shut up. 
3810,c.j.,Where did you hear it?
3811,c.j.,Yeah.
3812,c.j.,No. Tell me more about this.
3813,c.j.,Absolutely not.
3814,c.j.,What else is new?
3815,c.j.,No.
3816,c.j.,Yes.
3817,c.j.,Danny...
3818,c.j.,"I can’t, Danny."
3819,c.j.,"No, you idiot, I mean, I can’t have dinner."
3820,c.j.,Sam.
3821,sam,Yeah?
3822,c.j.,You heard anything about the cabinet meeting this morning?
3823,sam,Like what?
3824,c.j.,Like the President took Hoynes out for a ride?
3825,sam,Someone’s talking?
3826,c.j.,Yeah.
3827,sam,Who?
3828,c.j.,I don’t know.
3829,sam,Hey.
3830,c.j.,"Hey, Mallory. "
3831,sam,Yeah.
3832,sam,How you doing?
3833,sam,Mm-hmm.
3834,sam,Sure.
3835,sam,So what’s up?
3836,sam,Yes.
3837,sam,Yes.
3838,sam,The opera?
3839,sam,You mean to go and watch and listen to?
3840,sam,Why do you ask?
3841,sam,Beijing opera?
3842,sam, You’re asking me out on a date.
3843,sam,No?
3844,sam,"Right, and in what way will it distinguish itself from a date?"
3845,sam,Okay.
3846,sam,"Well, uh... like most people, I’m an absolute nut for Chinese opera. The Chinese being  known the world over for their soaring and romantic melodies, and what with your guarantee  that there won’t be sex, I don’t see how I could say no."
3847,sam,Yeah.
3848,sam,"Hey, you know what’s good about this? If you hadn’t come along with your offer of Chinese  opera and no sex, all I’d be doing later is watching Monday night football, so this works  out great for me."
3849,sam,"Yes, indeed."
3850,c.j.,Thanks.
3851,sam,Thank you.
3852,c.j.,What’s your thing about?
3853,sam,Nothing... What’s your thing about?
3854,c.j.,Nothing.
3855,sam,Okay. 
3856,leo, What do you need?
3857,sam,"Oh, we’re not here together."
3858,leo,Somebody go first.
3859,c.j.,Danny Concannon said that he heard that the President and Hoynes had a...
3860,leo,At the cabinet meeting?
3861,c.j.,Yeah.
3862,leo,"It’s nothing, C.J."
3863,c.j.,Then why is Danny asking me about it?
3864,leo,Who talked to him?
3865,c.j.,You think he’s gonna tell me?
3866,sam,It was Hoynes.
3867,leo,That’s what we need.
3868,c.j.,What do you want me to do?
3869,leo,Deal with it.
3870,c.j.,"You’re a real details man aren’t you, Leo?"
3871,leo,Deal with it.
3872,leo,What do you want?
3873,sam,I can come back another...
3874,leo," No, come on, what?"
3875,sam,Mallory had an extra ticket to the opera for tonight and she asked me if I’d like to go.
3876,leo," Mallory, who?"
3877,sam,"Mallory, your daughter."
3878,leo," Mallory, my daughter... "
3879,sam,Yes.
3880,leo,...has asked you... 
3881,sam,Yes.
3882,leo,...to go to the opera using the tickets that used to belong to me and Mallory’s mother...
3883,sam,Yes.
3884,leo,...the woman who used to be my wife? 
3885,sam,"Leo, for whatever it’s worth, she’s made it very clear we won’t be doing anything  tonight you’d have a problem with."
3886,leo,Like what?
3887,sam,Why don’t we stay away from that?
3888,leo,Best that we do.
3889,sam,So...
3890,leo,"I’m fine, Sam. "
3891,sam,You’re fine?
3892,leo,I’m fine.
3893,sam,You sure?
3894,leo,Jenny and I aren’t using them. Somebody should.
3895,sam,"Thank you, Leo."
3896,leo,"Go back to work, Sam."
3897,sam,Yeah.
3898,leo,I’m fine.
3899,c.j.,Mr. Vice President...
3900,c.j.,I’d just want to keep it from becoming a story.
3901,c.j.,"And I’d like to keep it that way, sir."
3902,c.j.,What happened at the cabinet meeting and how did Danny find out about it?
3903,c.j.,"Yes, sir."
3904,c.j.,"No, sir."
3905,toby,Let’s go.
3906,sam,What’s up?
3907,toby,"Banking Bill’s gonna pass the house, let’s prepare a statement."
3908,sam,Crane’s sure?
3909,toby,He said it was in the bag.
3910,josh,How’s lunch?
3911,toby,It’s in the bag.
3912,josh,"No, Toby, it’s not."
3913,toby,I just got done with Crane.
3914,josh,"Well, Crane’s two hours behind."
3915,toby,"Oh, don’t tell me. "
3916,sam,What they attach?
3917,josh,A land-use rider.
3918,sam,Who?
3919,josh,Broderick and Eaton.
3920,toby,Broderick and Eaton?
3921,josh,Yep.
3922,sam,Don’t worry about it.
3923,josh,"Big Sky Federal Reserve, Sam. They want to strip mine the length and breadth of Montana."
3924,sam,We don’t care.
3925,josh,We do care.
3926,sam,Not today.
3927,josh,Sam...
3928,sam,Since when are you outdoorsy?
3929,josh,"Please, this isn’t about the environment. It’s about retribution."
3930,toby,"Yeah, no kidding."
3931,sam,We need to see the President.
3932,josh,"Yeah, we need to see the President."
3933,toby,Broderick and Eaton?
3934,josh,Yep.
3935,c.j.,I am reluctant to characterize it other than to say the President is interested in what  the practical effects of the policy would be.
3936,c.j.,Very optimistic.
3937,c.j.,I’m sorry?
3938,c.j.," That’s being worked out, and I can go into more detail later."
3939,c.j.,"I could, but then you’d have no reason to talk to me later."
3940,c.j.,I’ll do that later this afternoon. Thank you everybody.
3941,c.j.,"Bonnie, find Toby for me, would you?"
3942,c.j.,"Danny, do you see that this is a restricted area? There are signs posted."
3943,c.j.,There are usually signs posted.
3944,c.j.,Danny... 
3945,c.j.,"First of all, you’re wrong. Second of all, shut up. Third, I went to Hoynes about your  thing and it wasn’t him who talked to you and I believe him, and now he’s really pissed  at me, and he’s right, and fourth... shut up again."
3946,c.j.,"Yes, well, I know that now."
3947,c.j.,"Say goodbye to Danny, everybody."
3948,c.j.,Thanks. 
3949,c.j.,No I’d like to keep it a surprise.
3950,leo,Big Sky Federal Reserve.
3951,bartlet,In Montana?
3952,leo,"Yes, sir."
3953,bartlet,What happened?
3954,leo,Eaton and Broderick got a land-use rider to the conference report.
3955,bartlet,Eaton and Broderick?
3956,leo,"Yes, sir."
3957,bartlet,Eaton and Broderick attached a land-use rider?
3958,leo,You surprised Eaton and Broderick had taken an interest in strip-mining?
3959,bartlet,I’m surprised Eaton and Broderick had taken an interest in anything.
3960,toby,"It’s retaliatory, sir."
3961,bartlet,For what?
3962,toby,The campaign.
3963,bartlet,What did I do to them during the campaign?
3964,toby,"You won, sir."
3965,bartlet,They want to strip-mine Big Sky?
3966,sam,Mr. President?
3967,bartlet,Yeah.
3968,sam,Swallow it.
3969,josh,I knew you were gonna say that.
3970,sam,‘Cause it’s the right thing to do.
3971,josh,"No, it’s not."
3972,sam,You mean to tell me that... 
3973,bartlet,"Excuse me, fellas, over here please."
3974,sam,"Mr. President, it’s a banking reform bill. That’s the ball game. Let’s not get into an  intramural spitball contest over a couple of rocks that are inhabitable eight months of  the year, anyway."
3975,leo,They’re pretty good looking rocks.
3976,josh,What Sam meant to say was that we can live without the environmental lobby.
3977,sam,"I don’t believe that is what I meant to say, Josh. What I mean to say is it’ll save real  people real money."
3978,josh,Tough.
3979,bartlet,"What do you do, Josh?"
3980,josh,Veto it.
3981,sam,It’s our bill.
3982,josh,Veto it anyway.
3983,toby,He’s right.
3984,leo,Why?
3985,toby,Send a signal to the banking committee that we will not be held hostage by Eaton and Broderick.
3986,sam,"Yes, Mr. President. Tell them instead we’d much rather be held hostage by wildlife activists  ‘cause that’s a position that always works well for us, and I think it’s particularly important in the next election that we carry Montana and its three electoral votes."
3987,josh,I always knew the day would come when Sam would start selling off entire states. I was just  hoping he’d start with Delaware.
3988,bartlet,Toby.
3989,toby,"Give me a few hours, sir. Let me talk to some people."
3990,bartlet,Leo.
3991,leo,Yeah.
3992,bartlet,"I don’t like these people, Toby. I don’t want to lose."
3993,toby,"Yes, sir."
3994,bartlet,All right. What’s next?
3995,bartlet,Hey.
3996,leo,Hey.
3997,bartlet,"No, don’t get up."
3998,leo," No, I’m just..."
3999,bartlet,"No, it’s fine. Please."
4000,leo, Did you need something?
4001,bartlet,"Nah, I just came to see what you were doing."
4002,leo,No appointments?
4003,bartlet,"Nah, you know, we had most of the night blocked for that thing, and it got cancelled so..."
4004,leo,Take the night off.
4005,bartlet,Nah.
4006,leo,"You should take the night off, sir."
4007,bartlet, Nah. I still got 400 pages of nonsense to read.
4008,leo,Leave it ‘til tomorrow.
4009,bartlet,I don’t like rattling around in that place with no one around but the butlers.
4010,leo,"Call Abbey, get into bed, and turn on the football game."
4011,bartlet,Maybe later.
4012,leo,Okay.
4013,bartlet,You had breakfast with Mal?
4014,leo,Yeah.
4015,bartlet,How’s she doing?
4016,leo,She pissed at me.
4017,bartlet,What did you expect?
4018,leo,I know.
4019,bartlet,You ignored her mother.
4020,leo,"Oh, come on. I didn’t..."
4021,bartlet,"No, I’m saying that’s what it looks like to her right now."
4022,leo,But she sees what the job is.
4023,bartlet,"She doesn’t see what the job is, Leo. And anyone would have to see it to believe it.  And even if they saw it, even if they believed it, what would it matter? She’s her  mother’s daughter, and you made her mother cry."
4024,leo,"You really threw some sunshine down on that one. Thank you, sir."
4025,bartlet,"Well, I’m right next door all night."
4026,leo,Me too.
4027,bartlet,Okay.
4029,josh,Yeah.
4031,josh,Can you tell her I’m not in?
4033,josh,How you doing?
4034,josh,The Banking Bill?
4035,josh,It is a good bill.
4036,josh,"Yes, it does."
4037,josh,"I have no argument with that, but when they attach a rider that says they can strip-mine  half a..."
4038,josh," I don’t give a damn about Big Sky. I DO give a damn about hanging a sign outside  the White House that says, “Hey Republicans and Congress, feel free to slap us around  anytime you want just to show that you can.”"
4039,josh,"I don’t like Broderick and Eaton, but that’s not the point."
4040,josh,How?
4041,josh,"Well, I’ll keep that in mind."
4042,josh,Why do you say that?
4044,josh,Yeah.  Got to go.
4045,leo,"Oh, thanks, Liz."
4046,leo,"Charlie, call me “Leo” would you?"
4047,leo,What do you need?
4048,leo,Yeah. Tell it to someone in the Communications Office. They’ll give it to one of the staffers.
4049,leo,Wait. Nancy Becker needs it tonight?
4050,leo,Give it to Sam.
4051,sam,Charlie!
4052,sam,How do I look?
4053,sam,"I went to the gym, rode a bike, took a shower and shave..."
4054,sam,"...Even got my shoes shined too, you know why?"
4055,sam,"I’m going to the Beijing Opera tonight, which I imagine would be excruciating, but I’m  gonna go do it anyway."
4056,sam, He wants me?
4057,sam,He wants me to write a birthday message for the President?
4058,sam,"Are you sure he doesn’t want someone who, you know, isn’t staggeringly overqualified  for the job?"
4059,sam,What time is it?
4060,sam,"Um, somebody? Anybody? Um, write a two-page memo on the personal story and professional  accomplishments of the assistant transportation secretary.   I got this under control."
4061,toby,Yes.
4062,toby,"The last thing you said was, “Are you listening to me?”"
4063,toby,"I’m not the one to talk to about the Banking Bill anymore, Mandy. I have hatred in my heart."
4064,toby,"You go ahead and pick them. Today, it’s Broderick and Eaton."
4065,c.j., Excuse me.
4066,toby,Hey.
4067,c.j.,What’s going on?
4068,c.j.,Toby...
4069,toby,Hmm?
4070,c.j., Mandy wants you to recommend to the President that we do it her way.
4071,toby,Do you understand what she said?
4072,c.j.,"No, but she seemed pretty confident."
4073,toby,"Talk to anyone you want, but in this particular room, I need to work."
4074,c.j., Mandy...
4075,c.j.,"Mandy, I wanted to ask you something."
4076,c.j.,"You know Danny Concannon pretty well, don’t you?"
4077,c.j.,"He’s sniffing around a story about the cabinet meeting this morning, which is not a  big deal, but I want him to back off."
4078,c.j.,Yeah?
4079,c.j.,Thanks.
4080,c.j.,"The President’s been messed with. He beat the banking lobby, and Broderick and Eaton  came back at the 11th hour and gave him a cheap clip in the knees. This is the kind of  thing Josh and Toby get geared up for. You’re not gonna talk them down."
4081,c.j.,"In our own defense, we actually do know that."
4082,bartlet,"Well, this is fine."
4083,sam,Excellent.
4084,bartlet,They had you write this?
4085,sam,"Yes, sir."
4086,bartlet,You’re not a little overqualified for a birthday message?
4087,sam,"I was happy to do it, sir."
4088,bartlet,Really?
4089,sam,Of course.
4090,bartlet,"I appreciate it, Sam."
4091,sam,No problem.
4092,bartlet, Listen...
4093,sam,"Yes, sir."
4094,bartlet,"I mean as long as you’re on it, and you don’t mind, why don’t we take advantage of your  being on it and, you know, really do a job?"
4095,sam,Do a job?
4096,bartlet,It’s his fiftieth birthday. Let’s give it the Sam Seaborn quill. What do you think?
4097,sam,"Of course, I’d be honored to do it sir."
4098,bartlet,"Good. Take your time. Bring me back the next draft when it’s ready. I really appreciate  it, Sam."
4099,sam,"My pleasure, Mr. President."
4100,sam,"Yes, I did."
4101,sam,Hello.
4102,sam,"I’d like to say first that you look beautiful tonight, Mallory."
4103,sam,I mean it.
4104,sam,Can we talk in my office for a minute?
4105,c.j.,Hello.
4106,c.j.,May I discuss your story for a moment?
4107,c.j.,Yeah.
4108,c.j.,‘Cause I really have a hard time believing that one of the cabinet officers...
4109,c.j., I’m gonna fire her.
4110,c.j.,You know who.
4111,c.j.,Why not?
4112,c.j.,"The President would appreciate it if you wouldn’t pursue this story, and to show his  gratitude, he can give you thirty minutes on any subject or subjects that you like."
4113,c.j.,What else?
4114,c.j.,Danny?
4115,c.j.,Will you take it?
4116,c.j.,Thank you.  
4117,c.j.,Yeah?
4118,c.j.,Understood.
4119,sam,Yes.
4120,sam,Sure.
4121,sam,Yes.
4122,sam,Yes.
4123,sam,Yes.
4124,sam,Yes.
4125,sam,Yes.
4126,sam,Actually it’s the Assistant Secretary of Transportation.
4127,sam,"Yes, one of them."
4128,sam,I didn’t chicken out.
4129,sam,My shoes are shined.
4130,sam,"This is something that came up, Mallory."
4131,sam,Fair point.
4132,sam,Don’t go home. Stay here. Give me a half hour and I’ll come up with a new draft.
4133,sam,Yes.
4134,sam,Yes.
4135,sam,"A birthday message, Mallory."
4136,sam,Half hour. We’ll get there by intermission. There’ll be plenty of death and shrieking  in the second act.
4137,sam,You look fantas...
4138,josh,Toby?
4139,toby,Yes.
4140,josh,You know what I think?
4141,toby,What?
4142,josh,I don’t think it was Broderick and Eaton. I just... I don’t think they have the muscle.
4143,toby, Yeah.
4144,josh,I think it was Crane.
4145,toby,Yeah.
4146,josh,"Honest to God, I think it was Crane."
4147,toby,Yeah.
4148,josh,"Your friend, Crane."
4149,toby,Yeah.
4150,josh,"The guy who told you that it was gonna go through, no problem."
4151,toby,Yeah.
4152,josh,You’re not bothered by this?
4153,toby,"I wouldn’t say that. I’d say we’ve reached the end of the line, and I’m really not  interested in how we got there, and I’m ready to move on."
4154,josh,How?
4155,toby,Sam’s right.
4156,josh,No.
4157,toby,Let’s tell him to sign it.
4158,josh,Not yet.
4159,toby,"Round’s over, Josh. We did fine. "
4160,josh,"We got screwed, Toby."
4161,toby,Not so bad.
4162,josh,"Yeah, but Crane and Broderick and Eaton?"
4163,toby,It was their turn.
4164,josh,I’m still working on this.
4165,toby,The President’s gonna need to hear something.
4166,josh,I got a few hours.
4167,toby,Suit yourself.
4168,c.j.,"Good evening, Mrs. Landingham. Is he free for a moment?"
4169,c.j.,I can come back.
4170,c.j.,Thanks.
4171,bartlet,"Hey, C.J."
4172,c.j.,"Good evening, Mr. President. Am I disturbing you?"
4173,bartlet,"No, sit down."
4174,c.j.,What’s going on?
4175,bartlet,"When are Josh and Toby gonna come up with a solution, huh?"
4176,c.j.,For the land-use rider?
4177,bartlet,"I want the banking bill, and I don’t want to give in."
4178,c.j.,The classic conundrum.
4179,bartlet,Yeah.
4180,c.j.,Speaking of classic conundrums...
4181,bartlet,I don’t want to hear about Hoynes and the cabinet meeting.
4182,c.j.,Mr. President...
4183,bartlet,Is Danny gonna make it a thing?
4184,c.j.,No.
4185,bartlet,What did you have to give him?
4186,c.j.,A half hour sit-down on the record.
4187,bartlet, Sold.
4188,c.j.,"Sir, the Vice President wasn’t the one who talked."
4189,bartlet,Sure he was.
4190,c.j.,"No, sir."
4191,bartlet,You’re wrong.
4192,c.j.,I’m pretty sure it was the woman taking minutes.
4193,bartlet,Mildred?
4194,c.j.,Yeah.
4195,bartlet,Let’s drop it.
4196,c.j.,"Yes, sir."
4197,bartlet,Anything else?
4198,c.j.,"No, sir."
4199,bartlet,Okay. Get out of here.
4200,c.j.,Thank you.
4201,sam,"Okay...  Okay, here we go..."
4202,sam,What are you Ralph Kramden?
4203,sam,Like I’m not under enough pressure?
4204,sam,"I don’t care if it’s a cupcake recipe, Mallory. I was asked to do it by the President  of the United States!"
4205,sam,I said I was asked to do it by the President of The United States!
4206,sam,"Yes, I did."
4207,sam, Nope!
4208,leo,"Findings, which by the way, did nothing to support our positions in light of the finance  committee’s speculation need to be referred back to the O.M.B. Yours very unhappily..."
4209,leo,Copy that to Josh.
4210,leo,"When he tells me, I’ll tell you. What’s next?"
4211,leo,"Hey, baby."
4212,leo,Sounds like it.
4213,leo,Yes.
4214,leo,"‘Cause, I felt like it."
4215,leo,"You know what, Mal? Your mom’s got a genuine beef. I widowed her the day I took over the  campaign, but I don’t think I’ve done anything to you. Working on the White House doesn’t  allow any flexibility in so far as leisure time as you’ve discovered this evening. I’m  done being blamed by you for this."
4216,leo,A birthday message.
4217,leo,Just my sense of humor.
4218,bartlet,"Hey, Mal."
4219,bartlet,"Margaret!  Hey, you’re all dressed up."
4220,bartlet,"Yes, uh, could you bring me the chief of staff’s schedule for today, please?"
4221,bartlet,"Thank you.  You look a little glum, Mallory. Did you have plans to go  out this evening with someone who had to cancel due to circumstances beyond their control  because they have made a commitment to a common and higher purpose?"
4222,bartlet,"Oh, thank you Margaret.  How’d that go by the way?"
4223,leo,We’re fine.
4224,bartlet,"Cool. He received a security briefing, a Central American briefing, and wrote a position  paper, and he’s been counseling me throughout the day of a bad decision I have to make.  Oh, and by the way, this was a very light day."
4225,bartlet,Uh... that’s a perfectly fair question.
4226,leo,"You know what, sir? I can take it from here."
4227,bartlet,Okay.
4228,leo,Thank you.
4229,bartlet,I’m right next-door.
4230,leo,Thank you.
4231,bartlet," Oh, my point is... give your dad a break. He’s your father."
4232,bartlet,Are you blowing me off?
4233,bartlet,Okay.
4234,leo,It feels like you are.
4235,leo,Okay.
4236,leo,"Is there a way, any other way, we can fix this?"
4237,leo,Did you hear the President tell you about my day?
4238,leo,"And now, Chinese Opera?"
4239,leo,Now you’re talking!
4240,leo," Yes, by all means, let’s ask Sam."
4241,leo,"I’ll me gone for a while, Margaret!"
4242,leo,I’ll be nice! I’ll be nice. Leave me alone!
4243,sam,This is getting serious.
4244,sam,Hello.
4245,leo,"Hello, Sam."
4246,leo,"Wha, is this really necessary?"
4247,leo,"Sam, I gave you the thing to do ‘cause I was pissed you were taking, you know,  blah, blah, blah."
4248,leo,"Anyway, I’m sorry about that."
4249,sam,"I figured. Say, you mind if I skip the coffee? I want to nail this thing."
4250,leo,"Forget it, Sam. Your first draft was fine."
4251,sam,"Yeah, but I want to nail it, Leo."
4252,sam,"Yeah, but still..."
4253,sam,I do.
4254,sam,"Well, that is the nicest thing you’ve ever said to me. Thank you."
4255,leo, I’ll be back in an hour.
4256,sam,Alright... Here we go...
4257,bartlet,Yes?
4258,bartlet," Yeah, okay."
4259,bartlet,"How are you, John?"
4260,bartlet,Good. What can I do for you?
4261,bartlet,C.J. already talked to Danny Concannon. I think we’re fine.
4262,bartlet,"Well, that’s a different story."
4263,bartlet,Okay.
4264,bartlet,"Good night, John."
4265,bartlet,John?
4266,bartlet,John...
4267,bartlet,Really?
4268,bartlet,"You shouldn’t have made me beg, John. I was asking you to be Vice President."
4269,bartlet,"Then don’t stand there and ask the question, John. It weakened me right out of the gate.  You shouldn’t have made me beg."
4270,bartlet,Yeah.
4271,bartlet,"Good night, John. "
4272,josh,"Donna, who am I talking to about this?"
4274,josh,Thank you. 
4275,josh,Mandy...
4276,josh,There’s a political cost of letting it go with the rider attached.
4277,josh,"No, we’re tied."
4278,josh," It’s not a win. Donna, will you tell Leo’s office that I’ll have  a solution for the President, very soon."
4280,josh,Does it look like I have a solution for the President?
4282,josh, Then let’s assume that I don’t.
4283,josh,"You can put a best face on a turnpike collision, Mandy. I’m not moved."
4285,josh, Nothing.
4287,josh,Okay. Where’s the Madison stuff?
4289,josh,"Donna, it’s twenty minutes. I need it faster."
4291,josh,"Yeah, you’re right.  Wait, what?"
4293,josh,They’re antiquated.
4295,josh, They’re antiquated.
4297,josh,Would you have them tell the President that I’m ready to see him in his convenience?
4299,josh,Yeah.
4300,toby,Hmmm... Hmm... Hmmm...
4301,sam," You know, I got to tell you, Toby?"
4302,toby,Am I bothering you?
4303,sam,"Well, I’m not feeling relaxed."
4304,toby,"Well, maybe you need a glass of wine."
4305,sam,Maybe you need to stop standing over my shoulder.
4306,toby,Why don’t you let me try this?
4307,sam,I’m gonna nail it this time!
4308,josh, Guess what?
4309,toby," Tell him to let me write this thing, will you?"
4310,josh,The antiquities act.
4311,toby,The antiquities act?
4312,josh,Yeah.
4313,toby,That’s creative.
4314,sam,The antiquities act!
4315,toby,The President is empowered to designate any federal land to be a national park.
4316,sam,Big Sky.
4317,josh,It’s a done deal.
4318,toby,Go tell him.
4319,josh,You want to come?
4320,toby,"No, I want to stay here."
4321,josh,What are you doing?
4322,toby,I want to nail this.
4323,josh,What is that?
4324,toby,It’s a birthday card for someone.
4325,josh,For who?
4326,toby,I don’t know.
4327,sam,It’s a birthday message.
4328,toby,Let me try a crack at this.
4329,sam,One more try!
4330,josh,You two need to put your heads down on your desk you know that?
4331,toby,Right away you’re starting off bad.
4332,bartlet,"Both black and grizzly bears inhabit Glacier Park, Charlie. And hikers are told to talk  or sing along the trail to keep them at bay."
4333,bartlet,It’s not as silly as it sounds.
4334,bartlet,I suppose.
4335,bartlet,"Yes, Glacier Park was the tenth. We have 44 to go."
4336,josh,45. 
4337,josh,I hear ya.
4338,bartlet,"Have a good night, Charlie."
4339,bartlet, What have you got?
4340,josh,The antiquities act. You’re gonna establish Big Sky National Park.
4341,josh,Yeah.
4342,bartlet,I can do this?
4343,josh,Yeah.
4344,bartlet,"You understand it’s a bunch of rocks, right?"
4345,josh,I’m sure someone with your encyclopedic knowledge of the ridiculous and dork-like will  be able to find a tree or a ferret that the public has a right to visit.
4346,bartlet," More than a right, Josh."
4347,josh,Sir.
4348,bartlet,It’s a treat.
4349,josh,"Yes, sir."
4350,bartlet,You would enjoy nature.
4351,josh,"I’ve tried nature, sir. "
4352,bartlet,The antiquities act!
4353,josh,"Yes, sir."
4354,bartlet,This is simplicity itself.
4355,josh,"Yes, sir."
4356,bartlet,Good job.
4357,josh,"Thank you, sir."
4358,bartlet,Thank you.
4359,josh,"Good night, Mr. President."
4360,bartlet,Good night.
4361,bartlet, Thank you. Good night.
4362,josh,Mr. President?
4363,bartlet, Yeah?
4364,josh,We talk about enemies more than we used to.
4365,bartlet,What?
4366,josh,We talk about enemies more than we used to... I wanted to mention that.
4367,bartlet,Yeah.
4368,josh,"Good night, Mr. President."
4369,bartlet,Good night.
4370,josh, Yes... Yes... Yes... So are you prepared at this point to...
4371,josh,It’s done.
4372,c.j.,We did it!
4373,josh,It is done!
4374,c.j.,It’s done!
4376,c.j.,We did it!
4377,josh,I did it! C.J. was on the phone with her fingers crossed.
4378,c.j.,All you did was just one phone call.
4379,josh,"It was a series of phone calls, which I masterminded, while I’m not one to be selfish  about credit, I think it is important to know that it is done, and I DID IT! Donna, call  Toby. Call Sam. Call Leo. Call the president. Tell them I’m on my way over. "
4380,c.j.,Congratulations!
4381,josh,Nothing to the press.
4382,c.j.,Yes. 
4383,josh,Claudia Jean?
4384,c.j.,Yeah?
4385,josh,We did it!
4386,c.j.,Yeah!
4388,josh,What?
4390,josh,Banging in my office?
4392,josh,Banging?
4394,josh,I don’t know what you’re talking about.
4396,josh,I didn’t notice.
4398,josh,"Because I didn’t, Donna. I’ve been on the phone for the last hour trying to seal the deal  to fill a seat on the Supreme Court."
4400,josh,You got to understand I’m talking about the United States Supreme Court right?
4402,josh,Okay.
4403,sam,Who da man?
4404,toby,You da man!
4406,josh,Wait there for me.
4407,toby,"Good morning, Mrs. Landingham."
4408,josh,Good morning!
4409,sam,"Good morning, indeed."
4410,josh,"Yes, Mrs. Landingham?"
4411,josh,"Well, that depends on your answer to this question, Mrs. Landingham: Who da man?"
4412,josh,Hmmm... Who da man?
4413,toby,You da men.
4414,josh,Thank you.
4415,bartlet,I heard we may have...
4416,josh,Yes sir.
4417,bartlet,I can call him?
4418,josh,He’s waiting for you sir.
4419,bartlet,It’s done?
4420,josh,Done.
4421,leo,"You got yourself a Supreme Court nominee, Mr. President."
4422,bartlet,This is huge. Which one of you is the man?
4423,toby,"On this one, we’d like to think of ourselves collectively as the men, sir."
4424,bartlet,"Mrs. Landingham, let’s make the phone call!"
4425,josh,Congratulations.
4426,bartlet,Thank you. You too. 
4427,sam,"Well done, sir."
4428,bartlet,Thank you.
4429,sam,"Oh, we really do."
4430,leo,"Let’s bring in the chairman and the ranking member from judiciary, the leadership from  both sides, and C.J. you should...where is C.J.?"
4431,c.j., Right here. 
4432,leo, Oh.
4433,c.j.,Sorry.
4434,leo,"You should wear a bell around your neck, you know that?"
4435,c.j.,Thank you.
4436,leo,So what do we want to we do?
4437,toby,"C.J. will let the press know that the president will introduce his nominee in an east room  press ceremony Thursday, 5 p.m."
4438,josh,"Can we do it on Friday, and give ourselves more time?"
4439,toby,Thursday.
4440,josh,Why?
4441,sam,Because that’s when people watch T.V.
4442,toby,Yep.
4443,leo,Are you sure?
4444,toby,Yep.
4445,leo,"Toby, you’re running the show."
4446,toby,I know.
4447,leo,Put the ball in the hole.
4448,toby,It’s done.
4449,leo,"No, it’s not. So get it done."
4450,toby,Yes sir. 
4451,toby,"Josh, get me everything."
4452,josh,We vetted him two months.
4453,toby,"I’m gonna vet him four more days. I want to know every parking ticket. I want to know  every girlfriend he stood up for dinner in 1953. Mandy, you’re gonna roll this guy out  on a show that makes the queen’s coronation look like dinner theater. Sam, you’re gonna  write the president’s introduction. You’re also gonna write the Harrison’s remarks."
4454,sam,Harrison’s not gonna like that.
4455,toby,Show him the robe he gets. He’ll like it fine. 
4456,toby,"C.J., no leaks. If the name of this nominee is leaked out before I want it to be leaked  out, I’m gonna blame you, and you’re gonna find that unpleasant."
4457,c.j.,"I got to tell you something, Toby. You’re hot when you’re like this."
4458,toby, I am gonna put Harrison on the Court! I swear to God I am!
4459,josh,We meet again three hours.
4460,sam,Did you see his face?
4461,josh,We’re home.
4462,sam,I’ll see you later.
4464,josh,The banging?
4466,josh,Peyton Cabot Harrison III.
4468,josh,Peyton Cabot Harrison III. He sounds like he should be a Supreme Court justice.
4470,josh,"Phillips Exeter, Princeton, Rhodes scholar, Harvard Law Review, for which he was, oh yeah,  the editor. Did I mention that he was dean of Harvard Law School? Did I mention that his  father was attorney general to Eisenhower?"
4472,josh,That’s right.
4474,josh,"You’re not gonna ruin this moment for me, Donna."
4476,josh,This is a big day for us.
4478,josh,You know what we’re finally gonna have?
4480,josh,A smooth confirmation process.
4482,josh,It’s gonna sail.
4484,josh,"It’s gonna sail, Donna."
4486,josh,"Yes. Well, your fortune cookie wisdom notwithstanding, it’s gonna sail."
4488,josh,Why shouldn’t I get my hopes up?
4490,josh,"Smooth sailing, Donna."
4492,josh,Nothing bad is gonna happen this week.
4494,josh,"Look, there is no reason..."
4495,josh,Well... okay.
4496,bartlet,"You’re too young to retire, Joseph."
4497,bartlet, Yes sir.
4498,bartlet,He’s on the short list.
4499,bartlet,Yeah.
4500,bartlet,We’ll make our announcement on Thursday.
4501,bartlet,"I haven’t made a decision yet, Joseph."
4502,bartlet,Mendoza was on the short list.
4503,bartlet,"That’s not true, Joseph."
4504,bartlet,"Excuse me, sir..."
4505,c.j.,Hey.
4506,c.j.,"I’m doing fine, Danny."
4507,c.j.,"Why, why, oh why do you ask me questions that you absolutely, positively know I’m not  gonna answer?"
4508,c.j.,"I can’t go out on a date with you, Danny."
4509,c.j.,Okay.
4510,c.j.,Danny?
4511,c.j.,Yeah.
4512,c.j.,Yes.
4513,c.j.,No.
4514,c.j.,Right.
4515,bartlet,I suppose we should get out there.
4516,bartlet,"I’m sorry Joseph, but I am..."
4517,bartlet,You’ve said quite a few words.
4518,bartlet,Let’s get out there.
4519,bartlet,"Joseph, when the next seat opens up, I promise you..."
4520,bartlet,"In three years, I would hope to be running for reel..."
4521,bartlet,"That’s a little pessimistic, Joseph."
4522,bartlet,"You know I imagine the view from your largely unscrutinized place in history must be very  different from mine. But I remind you sir, that I have the following things to negotiate:  an opposition Congress, special interests with power beyond belief, and a bitchy media."
4523,bartlet,"Well, I am not Harry Truman."
4524,bartlet," It’s “Dr. Bartlet,” your honor. Now, let’s go start your retirement."
4525,c.j.,"No, thanks."
4526,c.j.,I’m fine.
4527,c.j.,The president and Justice Crouch are old friends.
4528,c.j.,The man’s retiring today. It’s a courtesy call. What do you want from me?
4529,c.j.,No.
4530,c.j.,Danny?
4531,c.j.,Yeah.
4532,c.j.,What?
4533,c.j.,"You’re killing me. You know that, Danny. "
4534,josh,That was inches from my head.
4536,josh,Inches.
4538,josh,"It was inches. A little bit this way, a little bit that way, bam! Massive head wound."
4540,josh,"Yeah, but there for the grace of God, you know what I’m saying?"
4542,josh,I really think if big chunks of ceiling are gonna fall on anyone... I don’t know...
4544,josh,It should be you.
4546,josh,"From now on, before I come in in the morning, I want you to test my office."
4548,josh,You see this?
4549,josh,Inches from my head.
4550,josh,Who cares?
4551,josh,I don’t know.
4552,josh,He’s always unhappy about something.  Donna! Where’s my east Asia memo?!
4553,josh,What starts in two minutes?
4554,josh," It’s okay, Donna. I’ll just come and get it myself!"
4555,josh,Mandy.
4556,josh,We’re not gonna have any surprises today.
4557,josh,You’re not gonna get upstaged.
4559,josh,Thank you.
4561,josh,You should be nice to me. I could be dead you know.
4563,sam,Yeah?
4564,toby,"I would like you to play out that as a lifelong Democrat, he clerked for a Republican.  I would like you to play DOWN that he’d never written a judicial opinion on abortion or  revealed his thinking on Roe."
4565,sam,I’m already there.
4566,toby,"Well, thank you."
4567,sam,What’s this?
4568,toby,Lillienfield’s talking about something that’s bothering him today.
4569,sam,WHAT could possibly be less interesting? I’ll be in my office.
4570,toby,Okay.
4571,toby, Get her.
4572,c.j.,Tell him I’m watching.
4573,leo,One in three? 
4574,c.j.,Yes.
4575,leo,He said one in three White House staffers were on drugs?
4576,c.j.,Yes.
4577,leo,Where does he get these stats?
4578,c.j.,Leo...
4579,leo,I mean where does he pull them from?
4580,c.j.,"Out of the clear blue sky, but that doesn’t matter."
4581,leo,Is somebody bringing me a tape of this?
4582,leo,Nothing’s happening. Stay cool.
4583,sam," Is it possible for Peter Lillienfield to be a bigger  jackass? You think if he tried hard, there’s room for him to be a slightly bigger  horse’s ass than he’s being right now?"
4584,c.j.,"At some point, you hit your head in the ceiling, don’t you?"
4585,sam,I think there’s unexplored potential.
4586,josh, ‘Sup?
4587,josh,"Five White House staffers in the room. I would like to say to the 1.6 of you who are  stoned right now, that it’s time to share."
4588,josh,"Mandy, if you can’t laugh at this, then you’re just not having enough fun in show business."
4589,josh,"He’s a featherweight, Mandy. He’s a hairdo."
4590,sam,"I think if he put his shoulder into it, he could be a slightly bigger gasbag."
4591,josh,Yeah.
4592,sam,"You know, if he really reach for the stars."
4593,toby, Good morning.
4594,c.j.,Hey.
4595,toby,There’s no way you saw this coming?
4596,leo,Toby...
4597,toby,"Leo, I know I’m in your office. Forgive me.  But nobody saw this coming?!"
4598,c.j.,"Yeah. I can’t believe my psychic didn’t tell me, Toby. Rest assured, I’m gonna get  my twenty bucks back."
4599,leo,"Short-term, long-term?"
4600,josh,Short-term nothing.
4601,c.j.,I can’t go with nothing.
4602,josh,Why not?
4603,c.j.,Pretend we didn’t see it?
4604,josh,He’s a liar. He’s a fool. Categorically deny it and move on.
4605,c.j.,I can’t.
4606,josh,Why not?
4607,c.j.,"Because more than 1300 people work for the White House, Josh. I go to the Press Room  and categorically deny that anyone uses drugs, and it turns out that three guys in the  photo lab blew a joint over the weekend, which is not like out of the realm of possibility.  And my next question is..."
4608,c.j.,"Yes. Well, I categorically deny that there are any more than three."
4609,josh,All right.
4610,c.j.,"Yes, and I understand she’s selling her story to Random House for a middle six-figure advance."
4611,toby, All right. Are we done with Masterpiece Theater?
4612,leo,"C.J., we’re looking into it, okay? "
4613,c.j.,Yeah.
4614,leo,That’s what we’re saying right now.
4615,josh,"I don’t care if we say that, but... we’re not actually looking into it, are we?"
4616,leo,Yes.
4617,josh,"This is a joke, right?"
4618,leo,Yeah? Toby. 
4619,toby,Yeah.
4620,toby,"C.J., go do your briefing. The president paid a courtesy call on Crouch this morning.  We got some exciting names. On the short list is Ed Harrison. We’ll introduce the nominee  Thursday, 5 o’clock. This business with Lillienfield..."
4621,c.j.,"I’ve heard about it, and I’d like the chance to see it first before I comment."
4622,toby,Is the president aware?
4623,c.j.,"We’d like to keep this things off the president’s desk until we measure what, if any,  credibility..."
4624,toby,Good girl.
4625,toby,We’re not gonna postpone.
4626,josh,How?
4627,josh,"No, I don’t."
4628,sam,Mandy.
4629,toby,"Go back to work, Mandy."
4630,josh,"Now, hang on a second. I’d like to hear what-"
4631,toby,Hey! Go back to work.
4632,josh,We are not taking drug tests.
4633,josh,Because we’re not!
4634,josh,"Toby, if you..."
4635,toby,"Shut up.  Sam, go back to doing what you’re doing."
4636,sam,They just delivered five cartons of Harrison’s old papers.
4637,toby,Then go start reading.
4638,josh,Toby...
4639,toby,What do we know? What do they know?
4640,josh,"Now, wait, hang on a second. "
4641,toby,Josh...
4642,josh,You’re not making me--I’m not gonna be the internal affairs cop around here.
4643,toby,"Yes, you are."
4644,josh,"You want to know who’s doing what around here, you ask them yourself!"
4645,toby,"This isn’t the time, Josh. We taking water over the side..."
4646,josh,"Yes, and I’m not indifferent to that, but there’s a principle here-"
4647,toby,"No, there’s not. Not this week. We’ve been doing this for a year, and all we’ve gotten is  a year older. Our job approval’s 48%, and I think that number’s soft, and I’m tired of  being the field captain for the gang that couldn’t shoot straight! We’re getting this done!  What do we know? What do they know? Start with me, if you want."
4648,sam,Hello? This is Sam Seaborn.  Ow!
4649,bartlet,A quick confirmation’s gonna be good for us.
4650,leo,Ritter says we’ll get unanimous approval out of committee and 90 votes in the Senate.
4651,bartlet,"That’s a blowout, Leo."
4652,leo,Mm-hmm.
4653,bartlet,Just what the doctor ordered.  Thank you.
4654,bartlet,"Good morning, Mrs. Landingham."
4655,leo,Good morning.
4656,bartlet,When is Harrison getting in?
4657,leo,Late tonight.
4658,bartlet,Good.
4659,bartlet,"Good morning, Charlie."
4660,leo,Good morning.
4661,bartlet,"Peyton Cabot Harrison. Find out what kind of cigars he likes, what kind of perfume his  wife likes, and have them sent over to their hotel, okay?"
4662,bartlet,Yeah.
4663,leo,They’re gonna stake the hotels. Gifts coming from the White House...
4664,bartlet,We’re using back channels. What is going on with Lillienfield?
4665,leo,You’re staying out of it.
4666,bartlet,Fine.
4667,leo,Anything else?
4668,bartlet,"We’re gonna get this done, right?"
4669,leo,Yes sir.
4670,bartlet,All right.
4671,bartlet,I’m on my way.
4672,leo,"Thank you, Mr. President."
4673,bartlet,Thank you.
4674,bartlet,Leo?
4675,leo,"Yes, sir?"
4676,bartlet,"We looked at everybody, right?"
4677,leo,Sir?
4678,bartlet,The short list. We looked at Mendoza?
4679,leo,We looked at him.
4680,bartlet,Leo...
4681,leo,We fixed on Harrison.
4682,bartlet,"Yeah, you’re right. I’ll see you later."
4683,leo,Yes sir.
4684,bartlet,"Good morning, gentlemen. Sorry to keep you waiting. Let’s go."
4685,bartlet,Good morning. Good morning. Hang on a second.
4686,bartlet,Good morning. Keep your seats.
4687,bartlet,Good morning.
4688,bartlet,"Good morning, Toby."
4689,toby,"Good morning, sir."
4690,bartlet,Do this for me. Put together some information on Roberto Mendoza.
4691,toby,"Sir... it’s natural to have second thoughts, but..."
4692,bartlet,No. I just want to be able to know something. There’s gonna be a lot of questions.  I don’t want it to be “we had a Hispanic on the short list.”
4693,toby,What is it you’re looking for?
4694,bartlet,The reason we didn’t go with him.
4695,toby,The reason we didn’t go with him is because Harrison said yes.
4696,bartlet,Let’s do better than that.
4697,toby,Yes sir.
4698,bartlet,"Uh, what’s going on with this drug thing?"
4699,toby,You don’t want a piece of that.
4700,bartlet,All right. I’ll trust ya. Thank you.
4701,sam," Good morning, sir."
4702,bartlet,"Good morning, Sam."
4703,sam,Toby.
4704,toby,He wants me to look at Mendoza. What...?
4705,sam, I got a phone call before from a guy with some  information. I just picked it up. I read it on the way back. It’s not good.
4706,toby,Is it the drugs?
4707,sam,No.
4708,toby,What is it?
4709,sam,It’s Harrison.
4710,toby,Close the door.
4711,sam,It’s called an unsigned note. Every member of Law Review is required to prepare one.  It’s like an article.
4712,toby,I know what an unsigned note is.
4713,sam,"It’s 40 or so pages, well researched, footnoted, and revised with faculty supervision,  and it’s published."
4714,toby,Without the names.
4715,sam,Without the names. It’s scholarly work.
4716,toby,How do we know Harrison...?
4717,sam,Toby...
4718,toby,"What, I’m supposed to just trust “the guy on the phone?”"
4719,sam,"I spent the last three months reading everything Harrison’s written, from decisions,  to memos, to amacus briefs, Toby. He’s the author of the unsigned note."
4720,toby, Bonnie!
4721,toby,I’m gonna need the next five minutes the president’s got.
4723,josh,"Ah, he’s got a half government oversight committee. These are the people who literally  decide if we get heat and electricity in the White House."
4725,josh,Yeah.
4727,josh,Yeah?
4729,josh,I met you. I talked to you. I hired you. You know anybody around here who uses drugs?
4731,josh,You want to tell me who they are?
4733,josh,Good for you. Consider yourself interviewed.
4735,josh,"Donna, I’ve seen your records."
4737,josh,You need to learn that “no parking” means no parking.
4739,josh,Go to work.
4740,josh,What makes you think that everyone here can pass a drug test?
4741,josh," Oh, okay. Problem solved."
4742,josh,"I would think that in this day and age, people would be more comfortable knowing that they  will not now, nor will they ever be forced to turn over evidence against themselves. And  please, do not try and paint your position as anything other than preservation of a spotlight."
4743,josh, So what do you think’s really going on here?
4744,josh,I don’t know either.
4745,josh,What do we do?
4746,josh,Yeah.
4747,c.j.,"For those who didn’t understand me the first nine times, we are looking into this."
4748,c.j.,These questions haven’t been blunt yet?
4749,c.j.,"No, and you’re forgiven."
4750,c.j.,"We have 1300 people on the payroll, Chris. That’s a lot of information to gather, and  it’s not like we were loaded with free time before. And let me just add that as no one  and nothing here has been subpoenaed, and Mr. Lillienfield has offered nothing to support  his very bizarre claim, we’re not feeling the real need to get this done in a hurry."
4751,c.j.,Thank you. That’s all.  Set fire to the room. Do it now.
4752,c.j.,What do you want?
4753,c.j.,It was fine.
4754,c.j., I left my notebook somewhere.
4755,c.j.,In the context?
4756,c.j.,"I really don’t need your tips, Danny."
4757,c.j.,Why are you here?
4758,c.j.,I don’t have time for a little basketball game!
4759,c.j.,"Thank you, anyway."
4760,josh,Danny. You got a minute?
4761,josh,Do you have any information?
4762,josh,Would you tell me if you did?
4763,josh,You know what kind of information.
4764,josh,You know no one knows where I got it.
4765,josh,You’re right.
4766,josh,I know that.
4767,josh,What?
4768,josh,What’s he trying to hit?
4769,josh,Is it the nomination?
4770,josh,Nobody said it’s Harrison.
4771,josh,Okay. Thanks. 
4772,josh,C.J. likes goldfish.
4773,josh,She likes goldfish. Can’t get enough of them.
4774,bartlet,"Here’s an interesting statement.  “I join Judge Black, insomuch as while enjoying  my privacy, I am compelled to admit that government has a right to invade it unless  specifically prohibited by some specific Constitutional provision.” Unquote."
4775,sam,"Mr. President, this paper, is, in no uncertain terms, an argument of privacy is not a  right guaranteed by the Constitution."
4776,bartlet,Why isn’t this ever been brought up?
4777,toby,"It never came up, sir."
4778,bartlet,"We spent two months vetting our homerun nominee, he doesn’t believe in a privacy guarantee,  and it never came up?"
4779,toby,"It was simply never an issue in any order to be handed down, and if I may sir, we don’t  know for sure that he’s the author of the document..."
4780,sam,We do know.
4781,toby,"...If he is, I don’t think we can necessarily hold a 55 year old man responsible..."
4782,sam,Toby?
4783,toby,...for something he wrote when he’s 26.
4784,sam,"We’re not gonna be able to hold him responsible if we put him on the bench. And I promise  you, this issue’s gonna come up!"
4785,bartlet, When does Harrison get in?
4786,sam,Later tonight.
4787,bartlet,I want him first thing in the morning.
4788,sam,Yes sir.
4789,bartlet,"When was the last time either of you slept, I don’t care. Get ready for this."
4790,toby,Yes sir.
4791,sam,"Thank you, Mr. President."
4792,toby,Thank you sir.
4793,leo,Seventeen billion isn’t gonna fly. They’re gonna say it’s too much at thirteen five.
4794,bartlet,Excuse me.
4795,leo,Give us the room. 
4796,bartlet,I want to meet Mendoza.
4797,leo,Yes sir.
4798,toby,Does Mendoza know why he’s coming here?
4799,toby,Is there such a thing as the president’s...?
4800,toby,Fine.
4801,toby,That must have taxed your considerable creativity.
4802,toby,Fine.
4803,bartlet,"Judge Harrison, first thing’s first, are you the author of this unsigned note?"
4804,bartlet,"When I was 26, I wrote a paper supporting the deregulation of Far East trade barriers.  Nearly got thrown out of the London School of Economics. I was young and stupid, and  trying to make some noise."
4805,bartlet,I’m gonna bring Toby Ziegler and Sam Seaborn in here and talk about this a little bit.
4806,bartlet,"Okay. Charlie, please?"
4807,josh,"Toby, you got a minute?"
4808,toby,They’re about to call me in.
4809,josh,Privacy?
4810,toby,I don’t know.
4811,josh,He doesn’t acknowledge the protection?
4812,toby,Hang on a second.
4813,josh,When were you gonna tell me this?
4814,toby,Number one: I don’t report to you.
4815,josh,Toby...
4816,toby,Number two: He wrote the paper a quarter century ago.
4817,josh,He hasn’t changed his mind.
4818,toby,We don’t know whether he changed his mind or not.
4819,josh,We don’t care whether he changed his mind or not. You’re painting a picture for the president.
4820,toby,The president can paint his own picture.
4821,josh,"Yeah, but he listens to you.  When did we get the idea that Harrison was our guy?  When we used to talk it was never Harrison."
4822,toby,Yeah?
4823,leo,Yeah?
4824,leo,Yeah.
4825,josh,Leo.
4826,leo,Hey. 
4827,leo,"I guess you’re the guy with the worst job in the building this week, huh?"
4828,josh," I was interrogating this intern from the Legislative Liaison’s Office, and  she broke down crying while telling me about the bong she had made out of an eggplant."
4829,leo,You can do that?
4830,josh,I used to use a potato.
4831,leo,You’ve always been industrious.
4832,josh," Lillienfield’s not after that kid in the Liaison’s  Office, and he’s not even after the Senior Staff."
4833,leo,Yeah.
4834,josh,"Leo, you... know the worst kept secret in Washington... is that you’re a recovering  alcoholic, right?"
4835,leo,I had a hunch.
4836,josh,"Leo, you’re... Boston-Irish Catholic. Back there and back then, a drinking problem  wasn’t a problem.  This isn’t what he’s after... Were you maybe into something  that wasn’t so acceptable?"
4837,leo, Pills.
4838,josh,Were you in treatment?
4839,leo,Sierra-Tucson. Six years ago.
4840,josh,Leo...
4841,leo,"Records kept by these facilities are confidential, Josh."
4842,josh, He’s got ‘em.
4843,josh,You’re Leo McGarry. You’re not gonna be taken down by this... small fraction of a man.  I won’t permit it.
4844,sam,"The third amendment says soldiers can’t be quartered in private homes. The fifth provides  protection against self-incrimination, and the fourth against unreasonable searches.  You deny the right to privacy lived in those passages?"
4845,sam,They just fought a revolution but they had no question of their freedom. The Bill of Rights  wasn’t meant to codify the most crucial of those rights not to limit the others.
4846,sam,"So do I, your honor."
4847,bartlet,"Peyton, do I have the right to put on an ugly plaid jacket and a loud polka-dot tie and  walk down Main Street?"
4848,bartlet,Where in the Constitution is that right guaranteed?
4849,bartlet,"What about the use of cream in my coffee? Surely, there can be no free speech argument  to be made there?"
4850,bartlet,So you have no objection to the state of New Hampshire passing a law banning use of cream  in coffee?
4851,bartlet,As I lose the votes of coffee drinkers everywhere.
4852,c.j.,Hey. 
4853,c.j.,You were right.
4854,c.j.,The word “subpoena” appears in the lead in every story of this morning’s papers.
4855,c.j.,Not yours.
4856,c.j.,What are you holding?
4857,c.j.,Why?
4858,c.j.,Really?
4859,c.j.," The crackers, Danny. The cheese things that you have at a party?"
4860,c.j.,"The crackers, Danny."
4861,c.j., Give it to me.
4862,c.j.,"No, you’ll kill it."
4863,c.j.,I absolutely do not. 
4864,c.j.,The fish?
4865,c.j.,You named it Gail?
4866,c.j., Thanks for the fish.
4867,sam,"In 1787, there was a sizable block of delegates who were initially opposed to the  Bill of Rights. One member of the Georgia delegation had to stay by way of opposition:  “If we list the set of rights, some fools in the future are going to claim that people  are entitled only to those rights enumerated and no longer. The framers knew...”"
4868,sam,"I wasn’t calling you a fool, sir, the brand new state of Georgia was."
4869,toby,"There are natural laws, judge."
4870,toby,Then who will?
4871,sam,"Well then, you’re really gonna enjoy meeting the U.S. Senate."
4872,bartlet,"This Sam is young, drives me nuts too, but he took you off for a ride, sir, because that’s  what I told him to do."
4873,bartlet,"I understand, Peyton. Could you give us a little time, please? We’ll make you comfortable  while you’re waiting."
4874,bartlet,Thank you.
4875,sam,Put him on a bus.
4876,toby,"With a guaranteed confirmation we’re sending out the door based on a 30-year-old paper,  which by the way, no one will know about but us."
4877,bartlet,You don’t think the guy who called Sam wouldn’t know how to call a senator’s office?
4878,toby,"Mr. President, if this is really about abortion, we already talked about..."
4879,sam,"It’s not about abortion. It’s about the next 20 years. Twenties and thirties, it was  the role of government. Fifties and sixties, it was civil rights. The next two decades,  it’s gonna be privacy. I’m talking about the Internet. I’m talking about cellphones.  I’m talking about health records, and who’s gay and who’s not. And moreover, in a  country born on a will to be free, what could be more fundamental than this?"
4880,bartlet,Toby?
4881,toby, Let’s meet Mendoza.
4882,josh,Yeah.
4883,josh,You think Mendoza would be a bad justice?
4884,josh,Why?
4885,josh,"He didn’t rule in favor of it, Mandy. He’s not recommending it. He’s ruled that the state  has no right to interfere with it."
4886,josh,"And listening to you sometimes, I honestly wish you’d narrow it, so..."
4887,josh,"Mandy, I don’t..."
4888,josh," New York City Police Department ’65 to ’76, Assistant  District Attorney Brooklyn ’76 to ’80, Assistant U.S. Attorney Eastern District, Federal  District Judge, Eastern District -- Let me tell you something, Mendoza went to Law School  the hard way. He got shot in the leg, and when they offered him a hundred percent  dispensation, he took a desk job instead and went to law school at night. He’s brilliant,  decisive, compassionate, and experienced. And if you don’t think that he’s America’s  idea of a jurist, then you don’t have enough faith in Americans."
4889,josh," Well, I mean, just the law of large numbers says We got to win one one of  these days, right?"
4890,josh,So let’s make it a good one.
4891,josh,Whatever.
4892,bartlet,"I’m sure we’re almost done. Sam, what else you got?"
4893,sam,"Judge Mendoza, I have a note that your rulings have been upheld by the Court of Appeals  more than any other district judge in the country."
4894,bartlet,"You need me, Leo?"
4895,leo,"For just a moment, sir."
4896,bartlet,Would you excuse me?
4897,leo,Mr. President...
4898,bartlet,"What is it, Leo?"
4899,leo,There’s gonna be trouble.
4900,bartlet,Lillienfield?
4901,leo,Yes sir.
4902,bartlet,He knows?
4903,leo,We think so.
4904,bartlet,We?
4905,leo,Josh has it.
4906,bartlet,What does Josh say?
4907,leo,Get through it.
4908,bartlet,Josh is a smart guy.
4909,leo,No sir. Josh is a young guy.
4910,bartlet,We used to be too.
4911,leo,Mr. President...
4912,bartlet,Did you have a drink yesterday?
4913,leo,No sir.
4914,bartlet,Are you gonna have one today?
4915,leo,No sir.
4916,bartlet,That’s all you ever have to say to me.
4917,leo,You know it’s gonna make things very hard for a while.
4918,bartlet,"You fought in a war, got me elected, and you run the country. I think we all owe you  one, don’t you?"
4919,bartlet,Did Harrison get off okay?
4920,bartlet,Why?
4921,bartlet,"I’ll bet it has.  Do you have any more questions, Sam?"
4922,sam,No sir.
4923,toby,"I have one, sir."
4924,toby,"Judge, without knowing details of special circumstance, what would you say of someone  being fired from refusing to take a drug test at the order of the president?"
4925,toby,Yes sir.
4926,bartlet,Toby?
4927,toby,Sold.
4928,bartlet,"Judge Mendoza, would it surprise you to learn that for the past few months, your name  has been in the short list of candidates for the bench?"
4929,bartlet,"Well, then this is gonna knock your socks off. Tomorrow evening at 5 o’clock, I am  naming you as my nominee to be the next associate justice of the United States Supreme  Court. You were not the first choice, but you are the last one, and the right one.   Will you accept the nomination?"
4930,bartlet,Good.
4931,bartlet,Thank you. Sam and Toby will be in charge of your confirmation.
4932,sam,"Congratulations, Judge."
4933,toby,"It’s gonna be an excruciating battle, Mr. Justice, one I have no intention of losing."
4934,bartlet,"What do you say, Leo? You up for a good fight?"
4935,leo,"I believe I have one in me, yes sir."
4936,bartlet,Good. Let the good fight begin.
4937,bartlet,Mr. Justice Mendoza!
4938,c.j.,With the Santa hats on?
4939,c.j.,Nice.
4940,c.j.,You think?
4941,c.j.,Might.
4942,toby,Someone tell me why I’m standing here.
4943,c.j.,To weigh in on this.
4944,toby,I could care less.
4945,toby,More?
4946,sam, Who’s playing Santa?
4947,sam,Playing Santa?
4948,sam,Went on a diet.
4949,toby,How do you know these things?
4950,sam,I read.
4951,sam,Did you know that recordings of “Feliz Navidad” outsold recordings of “White Christmas?”
4952,toby,What are you?
4953,sam,I am fully briefed.
4954,toby,On what?
4955,sam,"Pageant of peace, season of hope, coming of the new millennium."
4956,toby,Coming of the new millennium?
4957,sam,Yes.
4958,toby,Fine.
4959,sam,Don’t start.
4960,toby,I said fine.
4961,c.j.,Are we done?
4962,toby,"It’s not the new millennium, but I’ll just let it drop."
4963,sam,It is.
4964,toby,It is not the new millennium. The year 2000 is the last year of the millennium. It’s not  the first one of the next.
4965,sam,"But the common sensibility, to quote Steven J. Gould..."
4966,toby,Steven J. Gould needs to look at a calendar.
4967,sam,Gould says that this is a largely unreasonable issue. 
4968,toby,"Yes, it’s tough to resolve. Yes, you have to look at a calendar."
4969,toby,What?
4970,toby,"I’m arguing now, I’ll call them back."
4971,toby,What do they want?
4972,toby,Huh. 
4973,sam,"You got to ask yourself which is more exciting, watching your car roll over from 99,999  to 100,000, or watching it go from 100 to 101?"
4974,c.j.,So technically the millennium is still a year away? 
4975,sam,"Yeah, but we’ve made all these plans."
4976,c.j.,"Donnie, would you tell them I’m on my way over to see the President?"
4977,c.j.,Who? What did you call... what did he call me?
4978,toby,Excuse me.
4979,toby,I’m Toby Zeigler.
4980,toby,I was at the coroner’s office. They told me to come here.
4981,toby,No.
4982,toby,Yeah.
4983,toby,No.
4984,toby,Why’d you call me?
4985,toby,Did he?
4986,toby,Yeah.
4987,toby,Yeah.
4988,toby,"Well, that’s my coat. I gave that coat to the Goodwill. There must have been a... "
4989,toby,"Yeah.  Listen, this isn’t a crime scene is it?"
4990,toby,"See, I got the call an hour ago, I went to the coroner’s office. I’m just wondering why  the body’s still here."
4991,toby,And then you’re gonna call the V.A. right?
4992,toby, Tattoo on his forearm is Marine Battalion Second of the Seventh. This guy  was in Korea.
4993,toby,"Yeah, thanks."
4994,toby, Merry Christmas.
4996,josh,"Good morning Donna, and a Merry Christmas to you and your whole Protestant family."
4998,josh,As you can see I have not yet bought your Christmas present.
5000,josh,That and how I scrape together the ten bucks.
5002,josh,Of Christmas gift suggestions?
5004,josh," “Ski pants, ski boots, ski hat, ski goggles, ski gloves, ski poles.” I’m assuming  you already have skis?"
5006,josh,Right.
5008,josh,I should feel that freedom?
5010,josh,Thanks.
5012,josh,Why?
5014,josh,Okay.
5016,josh,"I, uh, need to speak to Leo."
5018,josh,He wants to talk about your Christmas present.
5020,josh,Yeah.
5022,josh,Yeah. I’ll give that a lot of thought.
5023,josh,Hello!
5024,josh,This is quite an operation.
5025,leo, Who the hell is this guy and why do I care if he has a Merry Christmas?
5026,leo,Leave us alone for a minute.
5027,leo,Two minutes!
5028,josh,I’m tired of waiting for the other shoe to drop.
5029,leo,Yeah.
5030,josh,"Lillienfield’s got this information. He’s gonna hold it till after Christmas when people  are watching. I don’t want to tell you too much, but I want to make an attempt at a  preemptive strike."
5031,leo,"Well, you got to tell me more than that."
5032,josh,Sam knows a girl.
5033,leo,I’ve heard rumors.
5034,josh,I want to talk to her.
5035,leo,Nope.
5036,josh,Leo.
5037,leo,Absolutely not.
5038,josh,I’m saying--
5039,leo,Josh!
5040,josh,I’m saying something to keep in our pockets.
5041,leo,"I don’t want it in my pocket. I don’t want it in your pocket, Sam’s pocket, and I sure  don’t want it in the President’s pocket."
5042,josh,"Lillienfield is coming down the mountain. Leo, this is no joke."
5043,leo,"You don’t have to tell me it’s no joke, Josh. It’s my life. All I’m saying is we don’t  do these things."
5044,josh, All right. 
5045,leo,All right?
5046,josh,Yeah.
5047,leo,"Listen, you hear about this kid in Minnesota?"
5048,josh,No.
5049,leo,"A gay high school senior. He got beaten up, then they stripped him naked, tied him to a  tree and threw rocks and bottles at his head. You know how old the assailants were? Thirteen."
5050,josh, Is the kid dead?
5051,leo,He’s in critical condition. This is all by way of saying we’re gonna have to revisit hate  crimes legislation after the break.
5052,josh,"Oh, well we ought to gauge reaction before we say anything."
5053,leo,C.J.’s gonna send up a test balloon at her briefing. 
5054,josh,All right.
5055,leo,Margaret!
5056,leo,Let’s get this over with.
5057,josh,See you later.
5058,leo,Yeah.
5059,c.j.,"The President is scheduled to leave for New Hampshire tomorrow morning at precisely  10 a.m. on the dot, no hold ups, no delays, which means he ought to be leaving around  noon. He’ll spend Christmas Eve at the Manchester house, then attend Christmas services  with his family in the morning."
5060,c.j.,Yeah?
5061,c.j.,"Yeah, his name is Lowell Lydell, he’s seventeen years old, he’s in critical condition  at Saint Paul Memorial Hospital with a severely fractured skull, massive internal  hemorrhaging, and various broken bones and lacerations. We’ll keep you updated through  local authorities."
5062,c.j.,"Yes, I do. Though I suppose the best time to do that was the day before Lowell Lydell  got his brains beaten out and not the day after. Who’s next?"
5063,toby, Walter Hufnagle. I don’t know... I don’t know! I’ve been holding on for--  I say I’ve been holding on for the better part of-- Sure. Yeah.
5064,toby,I’m holding.
5065,toby,"A homeless Korean War Vet died of exposure out on the mall last night. I don’t know if  his family’s been contacted, I don’t know... what kind of burial..."
5066,toby,I don’t.
5067,toby,Don’t worry about it. What do you need?
5068,toby,What?
5069,toby,It might seem trivial?
5070,toby, Go away. 
5072,josh,Yes.
5074,josh,"Donna, I can assure you I’m giving your Christmas list the consideration it..."
5076,josh,Donna.
5078,josh,From who?
5080,josh,The two of you shouldn’t be...
5082,josh,Donna.
5084,josh,Yeah.
5086,josh,"Well, what?"
5088,josh,"For the moment nothing, we’re gonna--"
5090,josh,We’re gonna wait and see how-- 
5092,josh,There’s not much else we can do.
5094,josh,Yes. 
5095,josh,Could you stop looking at me with the face?
5097,josh,Like I just killed your hamster?
5099,josh,Donna.
5101,josh,I know!  I know.
5103,josh,I know... I have to work.
5105,c.j.,"Okay kids, remember the drill, in a big voice you’ll say your name, your grade and then  you’ll ask the President the question that you and your teacher have prepared and  written down on your index card.  Okay, how about a big, “Good morning Mr. President!” when he comes in the  room? Here we go."
5106,bartlet,Oh that sounded pretty weak to me. Let’s try it again. 
5107,bartlet,That’s better. Now who are all these people making a ruckus and tracking up my floor?   You! What’s your name?
5108,bartlet,"And when are you gonna get taller, huh? What are you, fifteen, sixteen years old?"
5109,bartlet,"Well, all right then, you’re fine. All right, lets go. Come on, I’m a busy man. I am,  after all, the President of Bulgaria."
5110,bartlet,"Now, wait a second. That’s not right. I’m not the President of Bulgaria. I am the  President of the Great Kingdom of Luxembourg."
5111,bartlet,"Now hold on, I know I’m the President of something... "
5112,bartlet,"Yes! Thank you. I am the President of the United States of America. Now, who has a question?"
5113,bartlet,"Yes, ma’am."
5114,bartlet,My favorite part about being President?
5115,bartlet,I’m doing it right now.  Who’s next? All right. 
5116,bartlet, Wait. Hang on a second.
5117,bartlet,"Okay.  Apparently, there’s a group of kids in the other room that I might  like better."
5118,bartlet,Yeah.
5119,bartlet,Okay. Send some flowers. Then I’ll call his parents. 
5120,c.j.,Yeah.
5121,bartlet,"Okay.  All right, now on with the questions. Now wait a minute, when you address me, please  bear in mind that you are speaking to His Royal Majesty, The King of all England."
5122,bartlet,"Oh, what was it again?"
5123,bartlet,Yes.
5124,sam,Hey.
5125,c.j.,Hey. 
5126,sam,Saw your briefing.
5127,c.j.,What’d I do?
5128,sam,I’m not sure I’d put my foot on the gas so hard with hate crimes legislation.
5129,c.j.,"First of all, I barely grazed the gas. Second of all, why not?"
5130,sam,Because we’re not sure where we stand on this.
5131,c.j.,I know where I stand on this.
5132,sam,"Congratulations, but the rest of us... "
5133,c.j.,They threw rocks at his head.
5134,sam,"I understand, but I’m just saying... "
5135,c.j.,Ah. I’ll keep my food off the gas.
5136,sam,Thank you.
5137,c.j.,What’s your secret service code name?
5138,sam,They just changed them.
5139,c.j.,"I know, what’s yours?"
5140,sam,Princeton.
5141,c.j.,Mine’s Flamingo.
5142,sam,It’s nice.
5143,c.j.,No. It’s not nice.
5144,sam, Flamingo is a nice looking bird.
5145,c.j.,The flamingo is a ridiculous looking bird.
5146,sam,You’re not ridiculous looking.
5147,c.j.,I know I’m not ridiculous looking.
5148,sam,Any way for me to get out of this conversation?
5149,c.j.,I’m gonna go talk to someone.
5150,sam,Excellent.
5151,sam,"I’m going to be in Bermuda in 27 hours, that’s how I’m doing. Where’s Toby?"
5152,josh, Sam?
5153,sam,Hey.
5154,josh,You got a sec?
5155,sam,Yeah. 83 degrees in Bermuda.
5156,sam,"Just me, some sun tan oil and 655 pages of briefing memos."
5157,josh,I need to ask you something. I need to ask you about your friend.
5158,sam,What happened?
5159,josh,"Nothing, listen...  you would describe her as, I’m sorry, what was her name again?"
5160,sam,Laurie.
5161,josh,She’s expensive?
5162,sam,"Josh, I assure you, I would have no way of knowing...    I understand, but..."
5163,sam,Yes.
5164,josh,Yeah?
5165,sam,Very expensive.
5166,josh,She’s elite?
5167,sam,Yes. Why are we talking about this?
5168,josh,"Sam, I need to know if she would divulge the name or names of any influential Republican  members of congress that she might have..."
5169,sam,No way.
5170,josh,Sam.
5171,sam,"I’m telling you no way, Josh."
5172,josh,Sam.
5173,sam,Josh!
5174,josh,There’s a thing that’s gonna happen.
5175,sam,What?
5176,josh,Lillienfield knows that Leo’s a recovering alcoholic. 
5177,sam,Everyone knows that Leo is a recovering alcoholic. 
5178,josh,"Yeah, but they don’t know that there were pills. There was Valium. He was in rehab."
5179,sam,When?
5180,josh,Six years ago.
5181,sam,He was Secretary of Labor six years ago.
5182,josh,Yeah.
5183,sam,He was high when he was running the Labor Department. 
5184,josh,Yeah.
5185,sam,And Lillienfield knows this?
5186,josh,"I’m fairly sure that’s why he started this in the first place. Lillienfield’s going hunting.  Sam, we owe Leo everything. I mean everything."
5187,sam,"I’ll call her, and we’ll go see her together."
5188,josh,Thanks.
5189,toby,Excuse me?
5190,toby,Sure.
5191,toby,"No. No. Just... I’m not a visitor. I was, uh... I’m not the police. I was... "
5192,toby,"Occurred to me that maybe he slept there a lot, maybe you knew him."
5193,toby,No.
5194,toby,"I’m just trying to contact someone that might, you know, be interested that he died."
5195,toby,Thanks.  You a veteran?
5196,toby, Toby Zeigler.
5197,toby,Merry Christmas.
5198,bartlet,No.
5199,bartlet,Leave me alone.
5200,josh, Good morning Mr. President.
5201,bartlet,"Josh, what are you doing right now?"
5202,josh,I’m helping prepare a strategy for the European economic summit in February.
5203,bartlet,Blow it off.
5204,josh, Okay.
5205,bartlet,"Seriously, take an hour and come with us."
5206,josh,You’re going shopping?
5207,bartlet,Leave me alone.
5208,josh,I don’t understand. How are you going shopping?
5209,bartlet,Oh I sneak out every now and then.
5210,josh,You sneak out?
5211,bartlet,"Yes, couple of agents, an unmarked black suburban. They tell the manager, they clear  the store, I’m in, I’m out. It’s like nothing ever happened."
5212,josh,I never knew this.
5213,bartlet,Did you know that there’s an underground tunnel out of here?
5214,josh,Yes.
5215,bartlet,I haven’t been able to find it even though I search almost everyday.
5216,josh,Where are you going?
5217,bartlet,"To a place called Rare Books, you know what they sell?"
5218,josh,Fishing tackle?
5219,bartlet,Funny boy.
5220,bartlet,Tell her to leave me alone. Sheila!
5221,bartlet,This is a Christmas thing I’m doing Mandy; we don’t have to make hay out of it.
5222,bartlet, Want to come?
5223,josh,An hour with you in a rare bookstore? Couldn’t you just drop me off the top of the  Washington monument instead?
5224,bartlet,"It’s Christmas, Josh! No reason we can’t do both. "
5225,josh,I suppose.
5226,bartlet,Let’s go shopping!
5227,c.j.,Hello Danny.
5228,c.j.,He suddenly realized he’d forgotten to get you a Christmas gift.
5229,c.j.,Yes.
5230,c.j.,Yeah?
5231,c.j.,Really?
5232,c.j.,"Well I’ll tell you what, give me a couple of hours to put together a list of reasons  why I shouldn’t, then we’ll compare them and see where we are.  My secret service code name is Flamingo. "
5233,c.j.,Go away.
5234,sam,Hey.
5235,c.j.,Sam?
5236,sam,Yup?
5237,c.j.,What do you and Josh have going on tonight?
5238,sam, Nothing.
5239,c.j.,I just meant did you want to come over for dinner.
5240,sam,"Oh, yeah."
5241,c.j.,What did you think I meant?
5242,sam,I’m going to Bermuda tonight.
5243,c.j.,"Okay. Yeah, that’s right."
5244,sam,What?
5245,c.j.,What did you think I meant?
5246,sam,It’s what I thought you meant.
5247,c.j.,Then why did you say nothing if you are going to Bermuda tonight?
5248,sam,I really don’t know.
5249,c.j.,Okay.
5250,sam,But thank you for the invitation.
5251,c.j.,Okay. Sam.  What have you and Josh have going on tonight?
5252,sam,Nothing. 
5253,bartlet,"Oooh! “The Fables of Phaedrus,” 1886, first edition, red leather label, gilt lettering,  engraved frontice. Phaedrus, you know, who was a slave, but later granted his freedom  by Augustus, wrote his animal fables in iambic verse."
5254,leo,"Well, nothing says Christmas like animal fables in iambic verse."
5255,bartlet,That’s what I say.
5256,josh,Let it go.
5257,josh,Ah. Here’s one. 
5258,josh,"A book which if I was stuck with it on a desert island, I still wouldn’t read it,  “The Adventures of James Capen Adams, Mountaineer and Grizzly Bear Hunter of California.”  I believe I would eat this book before I read it."
5259,bartlet,"So, you won’t change your mind?"
5260,leo,"Nope. I appreciate it, but... "
5261,bartlet,So you’re gonna sit around in your hotel room by yourself?
5262,leo,I’ve got plenty to do at the office.
5263,bartlet,"Oh! So you’re gonna work on Christmas? Good, that makes me feel better."
5264,leo,Look... 
5265,bartlet,"Come to Manchester, stay at the house."
5266,leo,"Oh, so you could read aloud from “The Fables of Phaedrus”?"
5267,bartlet,"I wasn’t planning on doing that, but now that you suggest it."
5268,leo,I’ll be fine.
5269,bartlet,Suit yourself.
5270,leo,Mr. President?
5271,bartlet,Yeah?
5272,leo,When you get back from the holiday I’m afraid we’ll have to start talking seriously  about my situation.
5273,bartlet,I’m not worried about it Leo.
5274,leo,"I know you’re not, but that doesn’t... "
5275,bartlet,"It’ll be fine, these things can go away by themselves."
5276,leo,"No they can’t, sir, and they usually don’t. I’m gonna need an exit strategy that’ll  cause the least embarrassment and turmoil during the Mendoza confirmation."
5277,bartlet,I don’t want to talk about an exit strategy.
5278,leo,Sir?!
5279,bartlet,I really don’t. It’s gonna be fine.
5280,bartlet,Yeah?
5281,bartlet,"All right. You know Zoey is starting Georgetown in two weeks, I was thinking about  getting this for her. “The Nature of Things. A Viviscalic Poem Translated from the  Latin of Titus Lucrecius Carus.”"
5282,bartlet,Yeah. Because it’s got brown Moroccan spine labels.
5283,bartlet,"All right, thanks.  Thank you all, Merry Christmas! "
5284,leo,You heard what I said before right?
5285,josh,What?
5286,leo,In my office this morning?
5287,josh,Yeah.
5288,leo,Ok?
5289,josh,Yeah.
5290,bartlet,"“Life of Epicurus”, two volumes."
5291,leo,Let’s go. 
5292,toby,"Excuse me. Ah, excuse me, I was wondering if by any chance you know a man named of  Walter Hufnagle?"
5293,toby,Yes.
5294,toby,"I wasn’t looking for him. I was, uh..."
5295,toby,Oh thank you. 
5296,toby,"Oh, there’s no problem. Down on the end?"
5297,toby,Thanks. 
5298,toby,Excuse me. Mr. Hufnagle?
5299,toby,"Are you, uh, Walter Hufnagle’s brother?"
5300,toby,I’m afraid I have some very bad news. Walter died last night.
5301,toby,It was a very cold night.
5302,toby,"I’m, I’m... I’m Toby Zeigler. Uh, Walter was wearing my coat and it had my business card... "
5303,toby,No.
5304,toby,"George, did you know your brother fought in Korea? "
5305,toby,"No, no. Uh, he..."
5306,toby,"No, uh, he was in the Marines about forty-five years ago."
5307,toby,He was given a medal.
5308,toby,It’s called the Purple Heart. It’s for getting wounded in battle.
5309,toby,Yeah.
5310,toby,"No, no. Uh, a lot of people were wounded or even killed."
5311,toby,"No, no I was-- Anyway, uh, I wasn’t sure if anyone had, you know, contacted you."
5312,toby,"Yeah, it was -- it was pretty cold."
5313,toby,Yeah. I’m sorry. Goodnight.  I’m a very powerful person. And I would like to arrange it.
5314,toby, Are you gonna be here tomorrow?
5315,toby, So that if I come and pick you up in the morning and I’ll bring you back after.
5316,toby,Will you? 
5317,toby,"That’s ok, thank you."
5318,toby,No.
5319,toby,I’m fine. Thanks.
5320,toby,Really. I’m fine.
5321,toby,Thanks. 
5322,c.j.,You are a reporter. I’m The Press Secretary. It’s an unavoidable conflict of interest.  It would hurt my reputation. It would hurt your reputation. Your editors would obviously... 
5323,c.j.,Yeah?
5324,c.j.,I’m reading you my list.
5325,c.j.,Didn’t you?
5326,c.j.,You didn’t make a list.
5327,c.j.,You said you made a list.
5328,c.j.,"Well, I made an actual list."
5329,c.j.,What did you come in here for?
5330,c.j.,"You already gave me a goldfish Danny, what more could a girl possible want? "
5331,c.j.,Goldfish food.
5332,c.j.,Yeah?
5333,leo,Hey Danny.
5334,leo,That’s a nice goldfish.
5335,leo,Happy Holidays.
5336,c.j.,"I’m rebuffing his advances, Leo."
5337,leo,"Whatever. Listen, dial down the rhetoric on hate crimes would you?"
5338,c.j.,You told me to float a test balloon.
5339,leo,Float it. Don’t shove it down anyone’s throat. I don’t know which way we’re gonna come  down on this one.
5340,c.j.,They made him say “Hail Mary’s” as they beat him to death. This was a crime of entertainment.
5341,c.j.,"Beyond the crime itself is a manifestation of racism, or sexism, or anti Semitism or  homophobia that are only a tip of the iceberg of the pathology troubling this country."
5342,leo,"I’m aware of all that. I’m just not sure it’s right to legislate against how someone thinks.  A lot of people aren’t sure, a lot of ‘em work here and I’m telling ya’ to dial it down."
5343,c.j.,Okay.
5344,leo,Thank you.
5345,c.j., You have plans yet?
5346,leo,For Christmas?
5347,c.j.,Yeah.
5348,leo,My plan is to do nothing.
5349,c.j.,Want me to come cook you something?
5350,leo, What are you my mother?
5351,c.j.,I was just asking.
5352,leo,I’ll see you later. 
5353,sam,Hi.
5354,josh,Hi.
5355,sam,This is Josh Lyman.
5356,josh,Hi.
5357,sam,Hi.
5358,sam,"Right, we’ll get right to the point."
5359,sam,"Right. Here’s what’s going on. A guy we work with is in some trouble. We believe a  congressman is about to expose something about his past that’s gonna be damaging to him.  And doing what you do in the universe in which you do it, we though that maybe... "
5360,sam,I never said that it was Lillienfield.
5361,sam,Yes.
5362,sam,This is for real.
5363,josh,"Hey, haven’t we met?"
5364,josh,Where?
5365,sam,White House. She came to the state dinner with Carl Everett.
5366,sam,"Laurie, this really isn’t about... "
5367,josh,It was my idea.
5368,josh," Yeah, I am. And I got to tell you, I could care less about your indignation  right now. A man has left himself open to the kind of attack from which men in my business  don't recover. Now if our tactics seem less than civilized it’s because so are our attackers  and in any event I don’t feel like standing here taking a civics lesson from a hooker!"
5369,sam,Josh!
5370,josh,"We don’t need your cooperation, Laurie, one of your guys wrote you a check and the I.R.S.  works for me."
5371,josh,Just give me a name. What do you want? Money? I’ll give you money!
5372,sam,I don’t think he meant--
5373,josh,"No, I didn’t.  In fact I’m sorry. I apologize. That was very rude."
5374,sam,"We wouldn’t have asked Laurie, but this person means a lot to us."
5375,josh,Yeah.
5376,c.j.,"Yeah, but we’re not just talking about burning a cross on someone’s lawn. People are  getting killed."
5377,leo,And people get punished for committing that crime. Do you also want to start punishing  them for what’s in their mind when they commit it?
5378,c.j.,Yes.
5379,leo,Really?
5380,c.j.,Yes.
5381,leo,Who is this?
5382,leo,Who’s Elizabeth?
5383,c.j.,I’m saying this is an abstract theory. It’s not enough to say we’re protecting people’s  civil rights; we have to actually do it. Plus it has the added benefit of being good politics.
5384,leo,"Ah, see? Now I’m listening."
5385,c.j.,We’ll get into it after the break?
5386,leo,We’ll get into it after the break.
5387,josh, Excuse me.
5388,leo,Yes.
5389,josh,You wanted to see us?
5390,leo,"Oh yes, very much."
5391,c.j.,I should leave?
5392,leo,As quickly as possible. 
5393,leo,You went and did it?
5394,josh,What?
5395,leo,Exactly what I asked you not to do.
5396,josh,Leo.
5397,leo,You went and saw Sam’s friend?
5398,sam,How’d you know?
5399,leo,I had you tailed.
5400,josh,You had us tailed?
5401,leo,Yes.
5402,sam,Why did you have us tailed?
5403,leo,On the off chance that you’re as stupid as you look. Whose idea was this?
5404,josh,It was mine. Sam was a reluctant accomplice. You had us tailed?
5405,leo,Get over it.
5406,sam,She didn’t give us anything.
5407,leo,I should hope not.
5408,josh,Leo.
5409,leo,"It’s not what we do, Josh."
5410,sam,"That maybe true, but still... "
5411,leo,It’s not what we do.
5412,sam,"Yes, sir."
5413,leo,You should apologize to that girl for even asking. 
5414,sam,I did.
5415,leo,Then apologize again.
5416,sam,"Yes, sir."
5417,leo,Like I’m not gonna have enough problems without the Keystone Cops.
5418,josh,We meant well.
5419,leo,Is that supposed to mean something to me?
5420,josh,No.
5421,leo," Well, it does."
5422,josh,I’m glad.
5423,leo,Go back to work.
5424,sam,It’s Christmas Eve.
5425,leo,"What, the country isn’t open Christmas Eve?"
5426,sam,Fair point. 
5427,josh,Leo.
5428,leo,I know.
5429,josh,It’s gonna get bad before it gets better.
5430,leo,I know.  Margaret! Lets get this over with.
5431,josh,I’m here Christmas.
5432,leo,Okay.
5433,c.j.,"There’s been no change with the Presidents departure time of 10 a.m. so we’re still  looking at about noon. This is a half day for us, so I’m gonna make it a half day for  you too. There is no more news from The White House. The lid is on. Have a Merry Christmas. "
5434,c.j.,"Hey, Fishboy. "
5435,c.j.,"Answer me this, and when you do bear in mind there’s a lot riding on it."
5436,c.j.,Your answer.
5437,c.j., A date with me.
5438,c.j.,Don’t you think imposing additional penalties for hate-motivated crimes is a powerful  statement by society against tolerance?
5439,c.j.,"Boy, was that the wrong answer."
5440,c.j.,I don’t agree with you.
5441,c.j.,Take me out tonight and convince me.
5442,c.j.,You heard me.
5443,c.j.,I’m not gonna say it again.
5444,c.j., I didn’t ask you out. You asked me out about forty-nine times and I’m  saying yes to one of them.
5445,c.j.,You understand we’re having dinner right?
5446,c.j.,We’re not having a fling.
5447,c.j.,"This is a business dinner, in fact bring your notebook. "
5448,c.j., My secret service name is Flamingo.
5449,c.j.,I have to feed my fish.
5450,josh,Hey Danny.
5451,josh,How’s it going?
5452,josh,Okay.
5454,josh,It’s got a molted calf cover and original drab boards.
5456,josh,I wrote a note inside. 
5457,josh,"Donna, don’t get emotional. Donna, don’t get... let’s try and maintain some kind of... "
5459,josh,I meant it.
5461,josh, Yeah.
5463,bartlet,Hello everybody. Welcome to The White House.  Joey. Welcome to the White House.
5464,toby,Good morning Mrs. Landingham.
5465,toby,I know.
5466,toby,Yes.
5467,toby,I know.
5468,toby,I know.
5469,toby,Thank you.
5470,bartlet, No.
5471,bartlet,Deal with it. 
5472,bartlet, I’ll be right back.
5473,bartlet,"Merry Christmas, Nancy. "
5474,bartlet,Hi.
5475,toby,"Yes, sir."
5476,bartlet,How you doing?
5477,toby,"I’m fine. Thank you, sir."
5478,bartlet,Apparently I’ve arranged for an honor guard for somebody.
5479,toby,"Yes, sir, I’m sorry, I... "
5480,bartlet,"No, no, just tell me, is there anything else I’ve arranged for? We’re still in NATO, right?"
5481,toby,"Yes, sir."
5482,bartlet,What’s going on?
5483,toby,"A homeless man died last night, a Korean War Veteran, who was wearing a coat I had gave  to the Goodwill. It had my card in it."
5484,bartlet,"Toby, you’re not responsible... "
5485,toby,"An hour and twenty minutes for the ambulance to get there. A Lance Corporal, United  States Marine Corps, Second of the Seventh. The guy got better treatment at Panmunjong."
5486,bartlet,"Toby, if we start pulling strings like this, you don’t think every homeless veteran  would come out of the woodworks? "
5487,toby,"I can only hope, sir."
5488,bartlet, When is this thing?
5489,toby,I’m going to pick up his brother and go there now. 
5490,bartlet,Okay.
5491,josh,You’ll like it.
5493,josh,Caddying?
5495,josh,It’s great!
5497,josh,"Well, it’s good exercise."
5499,josh,"You’ll be doing more than that, Donna. You’ll be reading the greens, you’ll be helping  with club selection."
5500,josh,"Who, me?"
5501,josh,"Oh, man."
5502,josh,Is this Claypool again?
5503,josh, Why do you let him in the building?
5504,josh,"Gimme that.   This is like the 43rd time -- This is Freedom Watch, right?"
5505,josh,"Yeah, you guys are real patriots."
5506,josh, Being subpoenaed? No. Why would that inconvenience me?
5507,josh,Thank you. Drop dead.  It’s what I do now. I’m a professional hostile witness. 
5509,josh,No carts.
5511,josh,No. Real golfers don’t use carts.
5513,josh,No.
5515,josh,No.
5517,josh,"I would wait until spring, but I’d want you to start practicing with that bag right away."
5518,josh,"Good evening, Mrs. Landingham."
5519,josh,I’ve been subpoenaed.
5520,josh," Yes, thanks. The President asked me to come by."
5521,josh,Where’d they go?
5522,bartlet,Keep your seats.  Admiral Fitzwallace?
5523,bartlet,Is it clear what India’s objective is?
5524,bartlet,"When you say “the Indian army,” what are we talking about?"
5525,bartlet,Five guys in a Humvee? What?
5526,leo,All told?
5527,bartlet, In the last twenty-five minutes?
5528,bartlet,"300,000 is an awfully large piece of troop movement to have been on a whim."
5529,bartlet,This was long planned.
5530,bartlet,All I’m trying to do right now? I’m trying to avoid making eye contact with the CIA Director.
5531,bartlet,"300,000 troops? I can’t move my motorcade from K Street to Connecticut without it showing  up on a weather satellite."
5532,bartlet,"Pick it up again, would you please?"
5533,bartlet,Any chance this is an exercise?
5534,bartlet,A threat gesture?
5535,bartlet,Any nuclear activity?
5536,bartlet,"Oh, I wouldn’t worry about that, that’s probably not important information."
5537,leo,How intense?
5538,leo,How long till it’s on station?
5539,bartlet,"All right. I’m ordering the Crisis Task Force activated, and I want you to prepare to  give me a national security briefing. Thank you."
5540,sam,What’s the ambassador’s name?
5541,toby,Which ambassador?
5542,sam,The Pakistani ambassador.
5543,toby,"You’re saying our guy in Pakistan, or their guy here?"
5544,sam,Our guy in Pakistan.
5545,toby,We haven’t appointed one yet.
5546,sam,You’re kidding.
5547,toby, Nope.
5548,toby,Hey Charlie.
5549,sam,Charlie.
5550,toby,"Good evening, Mrs. Landingham."
5551,sam, It’s been over a year.
5552,toby,What are you talking to me for?
5553,sam,We have no one in Pakistan?
5554,toby,That’s right.
5555,sam,Maybe that’s why they got invaded.
5556,toby,Yeah.
5557,leo,"The Pakistanis have about 20,000 mountain terrain troops at the frontier command along  the Northern front, and four divisions at the 10th corps along the Eastern front."
5558,josh,All this happened without the CIA knowing about it?
5559,bartlet,"I’ve already had words. TOBY, the U.N. Security Council is meeting in an emergency  session to try to affect a cease-fire."
5560,toby,"Well, I feel better already, Mr. President."
5561,sam,How could we not have an ambassador in Pakistan?
5562,bartlet,We were getting to it.
5563,toby,"How could the CIA miss 300,000 armed people walking all over-"
5564,bartlet,"They didn’t exactly miss them. In fact, they’ve got a very good photo now."
5565,toby,"Yeah, but the idea is to spot them before they cross the border, right?"
5566,bartlet,Yeah.
5567,toby,Oops.
5568,josh,"For the moment we’re just talking about conventional weapons, right?"
5569,bartlet,"Toby, how much do you know about India and Pakistan?"
5570,toby,I know that any war between these two countries that begins with conventional weapons  isn’t gonna end that way.
5571,leo,Wanna take care of briefing the Hill?
5572,josh,Yeah.
5573,c.j., Good evening.
5574,bartlet,Hello.
5575,c.j.,I’m sorry. Charlie and Mrs. Landingham stepped away. Should I go back and wait in the...
5576,leo,"Uh, no, we were just breaking up."
5577,c.j.,Can I tell the room there’s a full lid?
5578,leo,Yeah. 
5579,c.j.,Okay. I’ll send ‘em home.
5580,bartlet,"Thanks, C.J."
5581,c.j.,"Thank you, Mr. President. "
5582,leo, I’ll brief her in the morning.
5583,toby,Yeah.
5584,josh,Hi Zoey.
5585,sam,Zoey.
5586,josh,I’ve been subpoenaed. 
5587,sam,By Claypool? 
5588,josh,Under the Freedom of Information Act. It’s reported that I was running the internal  investigation after Lillienfield accused us all of being on drugs.
5589,sam,"Well, not all of us, Josh. Just one in three."
5590,josh,Right.
5591,sam,So Claypool’s suing you for the paperwork?
5592,josh,I’m being deposed at lunch tomorrow.
5593,sam,Who you bringing?
5594,josh,I’m not bringing anyone.
5595,sam,Josh.
5596,josh,It’s a non-event.
5597,sam,You should bring a lawyer.
5598,josh,I am a lawyer.
5599,sam,"Yeah. Seriously, you should bring a real lawyer."
5600,josh,Thanks for the pep talk.
5601,sam,No sweat.
5602,josh,Madeline.
5603,josh,Not too much.
5604,josh,I’m gonna look pale.
5605,josh,I know. I’m just sayin’. 
5606,sam,Yeah.
5607,sam,Yeah.
5608,sam,What’s up?
5609,sam,Who?
5610,sam,Who’s the client?
5611,sam,You’re serious?
5612,sam,Mike Brace is a Republican.
5613,sam,You think Josh and Toby might have a problem with that?
5614,sam,And he’s a Republican.
5615,sam,That’s understandable.
5616,sam,You’re very good. We’d come to you too.
5617,sam,"In fact, we did."
5618,sam,To get me to help you convince Josh and Toby to let you work for a Republican.
5619,sam, This is just my lucky day.
5620,sam,"That’s not true, Mandy. Josh and Toby are just as committed..."
5621,sam,I disagree.
5622,sam,Mandy.
5623,sam,This is going to be an impossible sell.
5624,sam,But it will be.
5625,sam,I admire your pluck.
5626,sam,Your pluck. Your gumption.
5627,sam,You’re welcome.
5628,sam,You’re gonna owe me a big favor.
5629,sam,"All right, we’ll be even."
5630,sam,"All right, I’ll do this and many more favors for you and we’ll be even."
5631,c.j.,Hi. We’re gonna have a briefing by the Treasury Department on the market adjustment...
5632,c.j.,"That’s what we’ve been asked to call it. That’s going to be nine tomorrow morning.  With that, the lid is full, you can all go home."
5633,c.j.,Bruce?
5634,c.j.,In the last few hours?
5635,c.j.,"I think you need to get a new source at the Pentagon, Bruce."
5636,c.j.,What kind of troop movement?
5637,c.j.,"300,000 troops?"
5638,c.j.,"I think someone’s havin’ a little fun with you, Bruce."
5639,c.j.,I was just in the Oval Office ten minutes ago.
5640,c.j.,"Have a good night, everybody."
5641,bartlet,Bobby?
5642,leo,And Pakistan?
5643,bartlet,"Well, we’ve got ourselves a ballgame."
5644,leo,When do we get the nuclear briefing?
5645,bartlet,3:00.
5646,bartlet,Okay. Thank you.
5648,toby,What kind of information are they looking for?
5650,toby,It wasn’t an investigation.
5652,toby,Did he bring a lawyer?
5654,toby,"Oh, good, I like the sound of this."
5655,toby, Hello.
5656,toby,Thanks.
5657,c.j.,Hi. You know what this is about?
5658,toby,Yeah. I stopped by your office before but...
5659,c.j.,I was at the reception.
5660,leo, Hi C.J.
5661,c.j.,What’s going on?
5662,leo,"India sent troops into the neutral zone in Kashmir. The U.N Security Council’s gonna  try to negotiate a cease-fire, but we believe we’re gonna start to play a role in the  next forty-eight to seventy-two hours. You can start to brief the press tonight, so  I want you in on some of the meeting stuff today."
5663,leo," Oh, including this one."
5664,c.j.,This happened last night?
5665,leo,Yeah.
5666,c.j.,That’s what you all were talking about when I walked into the Oval Office?
5667,leo,"I’m sorry, C.J., we..."
5668,c.j.,You told me the lid was on.
5669,leo,You’re gonna have to expect that sometimes.
5670,c.j.,"I got the question, Leo. A guy had a Pentagon source, I denied it. I called it ridiculous."
5671,leo,We know.
5672,c.j.,"Is it 300,000 troops?"
5673,toby,Yeah.
5674,c.j.,A couple of destroyers?
5675,toby,And four CVEs.
5676,c.j.,The guy hit it right on the button. I made fun of him.
5677,leo,We’ll tell the room you spoke without knowing the facts.
5678,c.j.,I guess that’s what I’ll do.
5679,c.j.,Don’t worry about it.
5680,leo,"As soon as you tell ‘em India’s the story, this is forgotten."
5681,c.j.,I’m fine. We’re across the hall?
5682,leo,Yeah.
5683,josh,White House Deputy Chief of Staff.
5684,josh,"Since President Bartlet was sworn in, 12 months ago."
5685,josh,I wouldn’t call it an investigation.
5686,josh,It wasn’t that serious.
5687,josh,"Whoa. Almost tripped me up in that clever web of words. No, I would consider drug use  in the White House to be serious; I wouldn’t consider my investigation serious, and  the way you know it wasn’t serious is that I was the one running it."
5688,josh,"Congressman Lillienfield held a press conference in which he claimed that one in three  White House staffers use drugs. I was asked to discover what, if anything, might have  caused him to say that."
5689,josh,The Chief of Staff and the Communications Director.
5690,josh,Yes.
5691,josh,"Yes, and I can save us all a lot of time by telling you that there are no records of  my investigation. "
5692,josh,I mentioned it to a few people.
5693,josh,Sam Seaborn.
5694,josh,Yes.
5695,josh,No particular reason.
5696,josh,Yes.
5697,josh,Yes.
5698,josh,Yes.
5699,josh,"My assistant, Donna Moss."
5700,josh,I told them that I had to waste a day on this deposition.
5701,josh,I probably told them that I consider these moronic lawsuits of yours to be...
5702,josh,"Because you have consistently acted not as someone determined to get the truth, but  someone who hates President Bartlet, hates people who support President Bartlet, and  is looking to make headlines and money. Now you have two hours today, and two hours  tomorrow. Look, will somebody please offer me some coffee? "
5703,toby,What the hell kind of briefing is this?
5704,toby,Where’d you get this stuff?
5705,c.j., I need a briefing.
5706,toby," C.J., we’re getting someone from State..."
5707,sam,She’ll get over it.
5708,toby,Yeah.
5709,sam,Listen. Let me ask you something without your head exploding?
5710,toby,What?
5711,sam,What would your first reaction be to Mandy’s working for Mike Brace?
5712,toby,What do you mean?
5713,sam,He came to her.
5714,toby,She wants to work for Mike Brace?
5715,sam,She’s thinking about it.
5716,sam,"Hey, Mrs. Landingham."
5717,toby,Is this a joke?
5718,toby,"Yes, hello. Is this a joke?"
5719,sam,No.
5720,toby,I don’t understand.
5721,sam,Toby.
5722,toby,I’m in disbelief.
5723,sam,What should I say your first reaction was?
5724,toby,Disbelief.
5725,sam,"He’s good on education, good on women’s rights."
5726,toby,Are you shilling for her?
5727,sam,I’m not shilling. I’m just smoothing the way.
5728,toby,Don’t do that.
5729,sam,She just asked me to take your temperature.
5730,toby,And please don’t do that.
5731,leo,An H-bomb.
5732,toby,"Joe, can you assess the command and control situation?"
5733,toby,"Good, ‘cause we were waiting for a truly terrifying part."
5734,bartlet,Like what?
5735,bartlet,"Well, bring in Dr. Strangelove and we’re all set."
5736,leo,"Thanks, Joe."
5737,bartlet,There’s an India expert I want to bring in.
5738,leo,Who?
5739,leo,No.
5740,bartlet,You guys are gonna love him.
5741,leo,He’s a lunatic!
5742,bartlet,He’s colorful.
5743,leo,He’s certifiable!
5744,sam,Who?
5745,bartlet,"Lord John Marbury, former ambassador to New Delhi from the Court of Saint James."
5746,sam,Where do we find him?
5747,leo,A psychiatric institution.
5748,bartlet,"He’s colorful, Leo."
5749,leo,"You’re really gonna let him loose in the White House, where there’s liquor and women?"
5750,bartlet,We can hide the women. But the man deserves a drink.
5751,leo,Sir...
5752,bartlet,Let’s get him on a plane.
5753,sam,Yes sir.
5754,bartlet,Anything else?
5755,leo,"Thank you, Mr. President."
5756,sam,Can I just say this about Mandy’s representing Mike Brace?
5757,toby,No.
5758,sam,Okay.
5759,toby,I feel like I should say something to C.J.
5760,sam,Don’t.
5761,toby,You think?
5762,sam,"It would be patronizing. If you don’t say anything, that’ll tell her that you think  she’s a professional."
5763,toby,I’m gonna go see her.
5764,sam,See what you do? You ask me my advice and then you ignore it.
5765,toby,Yeah.
5766,sam,Okay. 
5767,c.j.,Carol?
5768,c.j.,"In the next few weeks, it’s going to be important that the White House reassure  Americans and the world that the President has a firm grip on the crisis and is  working hard to defuse it."
5769,c.j.,They’re misspelling ‘New Delhi.’
5770,c.j.,"Hey, I’m happy when they use an ‘h’ at all."
5771,toby," Hey, Carol."
5772,toby,Okay.  I was warned that coming to talk to you might be insulting to your  professionalism.
5773,c.j.,"Well, you wouldn’t want to do that."
5774,toby,I wasn’t ready for the press yet.
5775,c.j.,Could've told me that before sending me in there.
5776,c.j.,I flatly denied it. I said I was in the Oval Office ten minutes ago and nothing’s going on.
5777,toby,They don’t think you lied to them.
5778,c.j.,"I know that. They think you lied to me, which is what happened. They don’t know me.  I’m from nowhere. I was just starting to get credible. I was just starting to get  their respect. You know how long it’s going to take me to get it back?"
5779,toby,There’s a concern.
5780,c.j.,"Don’t ask C.J., she doesn’t know anything."
5781,toby,There is a concern that you’re too friendly with the press.
5782,c.j.,Really.
5783,toby,We know it’s important that you have a friendly relationship with them-
5784,c.j.,It’s important for all of us.
5785,toby,I don’t disagree.
5786,c.j.,Does this have to do with Danny Concannon?
5787,toby,People see you with Danny.
5788,c.j.,This is outrageous.
5789,toby,"This is one time, and if we erred, it’s on the side of trying to-"
5790,c.j.,You sent me in there uninformed so that I’d lie to the press-
5791,toby,We sent you in there uninformed because we thought there was a chance you couldn’t.
5792,c.j.,Okay. I have all this work to do.
5793,toby,Okay. 
5794,toby,Hey. How’d it go?
5795,josh,It was fine.
5796,toby,Got to go back tomorrow?
5797,josh,Yeah.
5798,toby,Take a lawyer.
5799,josh,You get 450 bucks an hour?
5800,toby,No.
5801,josh,Then mind your own business.
5802,toby,Take Sam.
5803,josh,It’s nothing. It’s this guy.
5804,toby,Sam’s going with you.
5805,josh,"Oh, absolutely, ‘cause in the middle of an international crisis, what better place  to put our resources?"
5806,toby,"It’s two hours, just do it."
5807,josh,C.J. pissed?
5808,toby,Yeah.
5809,bartlet,Yeah.
5810,bartlet,This ought to be delightful.
5811,bartlet,"Thanks for staying late, Charlie."
5812,bartlet,Sure.
5813,bartlet,I’m sorry?
5814,bartlet,My daughter asked you out?
5815,bartlet,I should have locked her in the dungeon.
5816,bartlet,I could have built one.
5817,bartlet,"Charlie, you have picked the absolute worst time in the world to talk to me about this."
5818,leo, I think he’s here.
5819,bartlet,Okay.
5820,bartlet,Yes.  He wants to go out with Zoey.
5821,bartlet,Shut up!
5822,bartlet,Mr. Ambassador.
5823,bartlet,"Thank you for seeing us so late, and on such short notice."
5824,leo,Good evening.
5825,bartlet,Please sit down.
5826,bartlet,"Mr. Ambassador, it is crucial that we join together to bring about a cease-fire and  then a pullback, in Kashmir, before this conflict takes another escalating step."
5827,bartlet,You do.
5828,bartlet,Thank you.
5829,leo,David? Are you suggesting that China might intervene?
5830,bartlet,"Well, this just keeps getting better and better."
5831,sam,Toby?
5832,sam,I did.
5833,sam,"Mandy, uh..."
5834,sam,It wasn’t the reaction you were hoping for.
5835,sam,Yes.
5836,sam,Yes.
5837,sam,I told him everything there is to tell him. He did not warm to the idea.
5838,josh,Let’s go.
5839,sam,I’m ready.
5840,sam,I will.
5841,sam,Okay.
5842,josh,Talk to me about what?
5843,sam,Mandy wants to take on Mike Brace as a client.
5844,josh,Is there another Mike Brace?
5845,sam,"Not in the House of Representatives, no."
5846,josh,She understands he’s a Republican right?
5847,sam,"Yeah, she’s a pretty bright girl."
5848,josh,"Oh, I’m gonna kill her."
5849,sam,So you’re saying no way?
5850,josh,"Yeah, that’s a big 10-4."
5851,sam,Yeah.
5852,bartlet,Mr. Ambassador.
5853,bartlet,You know Leo McGarry?
5854,leo,Good to see you again.
5855,bartlet,"Please, sit down. We’ve been trying to phone your Prime Minister without any luck.  Can you help us out there?"
5856,bartlet,"Mr. Ambassador, I stood at a podium this morning, and I publicly condemned the incursion  by Indian forces."
5857,bartlet,My condemnation might have been stronger if my State Department didn’t feel that the  Indian action was provoked.
5858,bartlet,You deny there has been Pakistani movement in the Neutral Zone?
5859,leo,"The people the President’s talking about aren’t defenseless, Mr. Ambassador. They’re  carrying the M-16s we sold them."
5860,bartlet,Hang on. Look. The U.S. is committed to finding a reasonable solution to the dispute.
5861,bartlet,"Whatever the language, I know that you will agree with me that we have to find a way  for these two countries to exist together in a global community."
5862,bartlet,I’d imagine the Indian ambassador is going to say roughly the same thing about you.
5863,bartlet,Yes.  Thank you for coming.
5864,bartlet, Thank you.
5865,bartlet,I’ll take the Indian ambassador in the Oval Office.
5866,bartlet,"And then if you could just ask the Secret Service to step in and kill me, please."
5867,bartlet,Zoey just walked right up to him and asked him out.
5868,leo,She’s a very outgoing girl.
5869,bartlet,"See, but a dungeon would have put an end to that."
5870,leo,We learn these lessons the hard way.
5871,bartlet,I think you’re trying to cover up the fact that you’re enjoying this.
5872,leo,I’m not trying to cover it up at all.
5873,bartlet,I’m a father in pain.
5874,leo,"Well, really you’re just a pain."
5875,bartlet,Leo.
5876,leo,Got a racial problem?
5877,bartlet,A racial problem?
5878,leo,It’s okay to admit it.
5879,bartlet,I don’t!
5880,leo,Okay.
5881,bartlet,I don’t have a racial problem.
5882,leo,Okay.
5883,bartlet,I’m Spencer Tracy at the end of “Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner.”
5884,leo,Okay.
5885,bartlet,Racial problem!
5886,leo,I’m just saying...
5887,bartlet,"My problem is not that she’s white, he’s black, it’s that she’s a girl and he’s not.  To say nothing of he’s older than she is."
5888,leo,She’s 19. He’s 21.
5889,bartlet,"Yeah, but a guy learns a lot in those two years."
5890,leo,Okay.
5891,bartlet,Tracy was good in that movie.
5892,leo,Yeah.
5893,bartlet,Thank you.
5894,bartlet,Mr. Ambassador.
5895,bartlet,"I was looking a lot better before your country breached about fourteen cease-fire  conditions without so much as a phone call, so let’s sit down and talk. Charlie,  please close the door."
5896,josh,No.
5897,josh,This is the seventh lawsuit you’ve brought against the White House and the fourth time  you’ve deposed me and demanded to see documents that don’t exist.
5898,josh,No.
5899,sam,And I’d like to remind you that that’s the seventh time that you’ve reminded him since  he sat down.
5900,josh,I would imagine that there are.
5901,josh,Statistics suggest...
5902,josh,Yes.
5903,josh,"What, are you crazy?"
5904,josh,Drinking isn’t against the law.
5905,sam,"He’s not going to tell you the names of people he knows to be alcoholics, move on."
5906,josh,I won’t answer that.
5907,josh,I won’t answer that.
5908,sam,He’s not obligated to answer that question. 
5909,sam,"It’s irrelevant to your cause of action under the Freedom of Information Act in which  you are seeking any and all documents relating to Joshua Lyman’s investigation of  illegal drug use in the White House. We go see the judge right now, she’ll sustain  my objection."
5910,josh,There was no investigation.
5911,josh,Yes.
5912,josh,Yes.
5913,josh,How did you get that?
5914,josh,This is a piece of paper obtained illegally.
5915,sam,We’re going to postpone this deposition.
5916,sam,"We’re postponing. You have a problem with it, cite us for contempt."
5917,sam,Josh!
5918,sam,Go.
5919,sam, You’re a cheap hack. And if you come after Leo I’m gonna bust you like  a piñata.
5920,bartlet,"My frustration, Mr. Ambassador, is that both you and the Pakistanis have nuclear weapons  and a tendency to get cranky."
5921,bartlet,"Well, it was nice spending this time with you."
5922,bartlet,Thank you.
5923,leo, Thank you.
5924,bartlet,"Every time he talks about colonial Western imperialism, I always want to remind him  that the United States is also a revolutionary country that threw off its colonial masters."
5925,leo,Why don’t you?
5926,bartlet,I keep forgetting.
5927,bartlet,Is he here?
5928,bartlet,Send him in please.
5929,leo,"Oh, God help me."
5930,bartlet,John!
5931,bartlet,Thank you for coming. How was your flight?
5932,leo,"Oh, I see."
5933,leo,"Yes. We’ve met, ten or twelve times. I’m Leo McGarry."
5934,leo,"No, I’m the White House Chief of Staff."
5935,leo,"Oh, I’m afraid we don’t allow smoking in this part of the world."
5936,leo,Yes sir.
5937,leo,Sir.
5938,bartlet,"We need your take on the situation, John."
5939,bartlet,The world is coming apart at the seams.
5940,leo,Yes.
5941,c.j.," -- the Earl of Sherbourne, he is the great great grandson of a former  Viceroy and for thirteen years served as the Queen’s minister to either India or  Pakistan. Lord Marbury is here to council the President, and if you think this is  all starting to sound like a Gilbert and Sullivan operetta, I don’t blame you a bit. "
5942,c.j., Yes.
5943,c.j.,Okay.  Hello.
5944,toby,I feel that I didn’t have the opportunity to properly articulate my argument.
5945,c.j.,"Either I’m a trusted member of the communications staff or I’m not, Toby, what was your  argument?"
5946,toby,That was my argument.
5947,c.j.,That wasn’t your argument.
5948,toby," It was my argument a little while ago, when I was arguing in my head."
5949,c.j.,Are you apologizing?
5950,toby,Yes. 
5951,c.j.,Well?
5952,toby,What?
5953,c.j.,Apologize!
5954,toby, I’m sorry!
5955,c.j.,God!
5956,toby,I was trying to do it nicer than that.
5957,c.j., Whose idea was it?
5958,toby,Mine.
5959,c.j.,"You were the one who said “India’s invaded Pakistan, let’s not tell C.J.?”"
5960,toby,I didn’t say it like that.
5961,c.j.,"Well, how’d you say it?"
5962,toby,I said it nicer.
5964,josh,"Hi, Donna."
5966,josh,Yeah.
5968,josh," No, actually, it didn’t. Thanks."
5969,toby,You’re back.
5970,josh,Yeah.
5971,c.j.,Toby apologized to me.
5972,josh,Listen...
5973,c.j.,In his way.
5974,josh,"Listen, I need to tell you guys something."
5975,sam,Yeah?
5976,sam,What?
5977,sam,"It’s a bad idea, Mandy."
5978,sam,No.
5979,sam,"Leo’s in trouble. You’re a political consultant. Your job isn’t to end the fight, it’s  to win it! Now you can work for us or you can work for them, but you can’t do both."
5980,josh,Sam?
5981,sam,Yeah.
5982,josh,Let’s go.
5983,leo,"Oh, I think that’s nonsense."
5984,leo,Yes. I think you’re dramatically over-estimating the possibility of escalation beyond  the point we’re at now.
5985,leo,Thank you.
5986,leo,All right.
5987,bartlet,"Yeah, go ahead."
5988,leo, I don’t even think the accent’s real.
5989,bartlet,I want to ask him to stay a little bit and help us out.
5990,leo,For how long?
5991,bartlet,You two are going to become good friends.
5992,leo,He thinks I’m the butler.
5993,bartlet,"For the first couple of weeks, so did I."
5994,bartlet,"Hello, Margaret."
5995,leo,What do you need?
5996,leo,Yeah.  Would you excuse me for a moment?
5997,bartlet,Yeah.
5998,leo,What’s going on?
5999,josh,"It didn’t go well. Claypool’s got a copy of your records from rehab. Either he got  ‘em from Lillienfield or the other way around. I was in a position where I was gonna  perjure myself, so SAM ended the deposition. Claypool’s next step is to call a reporter,  so I’m pretty sure you’re going to be read about this soon, so I wanted to ask you,  does your family know?"
6000,leo,Yes.
6001,josh,"‘Cause if they don’t, Leo..."
6002,leo,They know.
6003,josh,And the President?
6004,leo,Yes.
6005,josh,You ready for this?
6006,leo,Yes.
6007,josh,Then we’re here for whatever you need. We just wanted to come in and tell you that.
6008,bartlet,Is he still on the phone?
6009,bartlet,Okay.
6010,bartlet, There’s a quote from Revelations I’m trying to remember.
6011,bartlet,It’s about a horse.
6012,bartlet,Why not?
6013,bartlet,"Say, listen. My hesitation about your going out with Zoey before, you know, it’s not  ‘cause you’re black."
6014,bartlet,It’s not.
6015,bartlet,It is.
6016,bartlet,"Still, I want you to go out with her if that’s what you both want to do."
6017,bartlet,That’s fine.
6018,bartlet,"Just remember these two things: She’s nineteen years old, and the 82nd Airborne works for me."
6019,bartlet,"Also this - no kidding. You go out with Zoey, you’re gonna get your picture taken.  There’s gonna be a lot of people not wild about the sight of you and the President’s  daughter. You know what to do with the mail, right?"
6020,bartlet, All right. You keep your head up.
6021,bartlet,Should have built a dungeon.
6022,bartlet," Revelations. It’s about a horse,  and Death was riding on it maybe."
6023,bartlet,Okay.
6024,bartlet,"Yes, please."
6025,bartlet,"Thank you, Charlie."
6026,bartlet,"Ah, good, I want you all to meet John."
6027,leo,"Mr. President, before Lord Fauntleroy..."
6028,bartlet,Lord Marbury.
6029,leo,"Whatever. Before he comes back in the room, I wanted to tell you that Josh’s deposition  did not go well, and that the story will probably break soon."
6030,bartlet,How you doing?
6031,leo,I’m fine.
6032,bartlet,Don’t you ever forget the battles you’ve fought and won.
6033,leo,Yes sir.
6034,leo,"Excellent deducing, your Lordship."
6035,bartlet,That’s what I’d heard. But all they got was two weeks.
6036,bartlet,"John, I was hoping you’d stick around for a couple of days and help us out."
6037,leo,"Well, let’s play it by ear."
6038,bartlet,"John, there’s a quote from Revelations..."
6039,bartlet,"Are you frightened, John?"
6040,bartlet,Yes.
6041,bartlet,Good.
6042,bartlet,"With nearly 18 million new jobs, wages rising at more than twice the rate of inflation,  the highest home ownership in history, the smallest welfare rolls in 30 years and the  lowest peacetime unemployment since 1957.  I stand before you to report that  America has created the longest peacetime economic expansion in our history. For the  first time in three decades, the budget is balanced. From a deficit of 290 million  dollars just ten years ago..."
6043,toby,Billion dollars.
6044,bartlet,What?
6045,toby,290 billion.
6046,bartlet,What’d I say?
6047,toby,"You said million, but let’s move on."
6048,bartlet,I said million?
6049,toby,Yep.
6050,bartlet," From a deficit of 290 billion dollars, just ten... it says “million”  on the TelePrompTer, by the way."
6051,toby,Sam?
6052,sam,Our fault.
6053,bartlet,L-Let’s take it back.
6054,josh,He doesn’t look so good.
6055,c.j.,Yeah.
6056,josh,He’s pale and he’s sweating.
6057,c.j.,I know.
6058,josh,You think he’s getting sick?
6059,c.j.,I don’t know.
6060,josh,Are his glands swollen?
6061,c.j.,Damn.
6062,josh,What?
6063,josh,What?
6064,c.j.,I forgot to feel the President’s glands.
6065,josh,Do you think the joke reflex you use as a defense mechanism is why you have so much  trouble keeping a man?
6066,c.j.,You know...?
6067,josh,"I’m saying, we’re 44 hours away from the State of the Union, and he doesn’t look so good."
6068,bartlet,"...And how do we make the American dream of opportunity a reality for all? I came to  this hallowed chamber one year ago, and I see we’re spelling “hallowed” with a pound  sign in the middle of it."
6069,sam,We’ll fix that.
6070,bartlet,The pound sign’s silent?
6071,leo,"Move on, Mr. President."
6072,bartlet,"I came to this hallowed chamber one year ago on a mission: to restore the American  dream for all our people, as we gaze at the vast horizon of possibilities open to us  in the 321st century... Wow, that was ambitious of me, wasn’t it?"
6073,sam, Leo...
6074,leo,Let’s take a break.
6075,bartlet,"We meant “stronger” here, right?"
6076,sam,What’s it say?
6077,bartlet,I’m proud to report our country’s stranger than it was a year ago?
6078,sam,That’s a typo.
6079,bartlet,Could go either way.
6080,toby,Sam?
6081,sam,Taking care of it. 
6082,josh,Mr. President?
6083,bartlet,"Yes, sir."
6084,josh,How do you feel?
6085,bartlet,Why is everyone asking me that today?
6086,josh,But you don’t look so good.
6087,bartlet,I’m fine.
6088,josh,You’re pale and you’re perspiring.
6089,bartlet,I’m fine.
6090,c.j.,"You should be taking something, sir."
6091,bartlet,"I’m taking many things, C.J."
6092,c.j.,What are you taking?
6093,bartlet,I don’t know. My wife hands me pills. I swallow them with water.
6094,sam,Sir?
6095,bartlet,Vitamin C. Vitamin B. Is it possible I’m taking something called 'euthanasia'?
6096,sam,Echinacea?
6097,bartlet,"Ah, that sounds more like it... Toby?"
6098,toby,"Yes, sir."
6099,c.j.,Mr. President.
6100,bartlet,"I’m taking pills, C.J."
6101,c.j.,"Are you actually taking them, or are you just carrying them around in your pocket?"
6102,bartlet," You know, carrying them around in my pocket was a pretty big step for me."
6103,c.j.,You got to take the pills.
6104,bartlet,Toby?
6105,toby,Yeah?
6106,bartlet,“How do we make the American dream a reality for all who work for it.” 
6107,toby,"Oh, come on."
6108,bartlet,"You got to add, “who work for it.”"
6109,toby,Sir?
6110,josh,That was me.
6111,toby,We’ve decided this two weeks ago.
6112,josh,We’ve seen some pretty compelling polling samples. We need “people who work for it”  and I’ll tell you what else.
6113,toby,What?
6114,josh,“The era of big government is over.”
6115,toby," Oh, when did this happen?"
6116,josh,"This morning, we had a meeting."
6117,toby,We decided to offend poor people?
6118,josh,The people we’re offending won’t be watching the State of the Union.
6119,toby,"Yeah, I can’t imagine why not."
6120,bartlet,"It’s what they’re listening for in welfare reforms, so screw it."
6121,toby,"Alright, but when you get visited in the middle of the night by the ghost of Christmas  future, don’t come running to me."
6122,bartlet,"Damn, Toby, ‘cause you’re exactly who I was gonna come running to."
6123,toby,You don’t look so good.
6124,bartlet,"Well, I’m gazing in the 321st century, man. There’s a lot on my mind."
6125,leo,Let’s finish up in here. 
6126,c.j.,Mr. President?
6127,bartlet,"Oh, dear God. I will take the pills, C.J."
6128,c.j.,Will you take them now?
6129,bartlet,"Yes. I will go to the Oval Office, and pour a glass of water from the Steuben glass  pitcher, which was a gift from the Christian Charity Network there, Skippy."
6130,toby,Mr. President?
6131,bartlet,"I’m just saying, before you start calling me, Ebenezer Bartlet, remember, I got a  really nice glass pitcher for just, you know, being a good guy."
6132,toby,"Well, you turned me right around on that one, Mr. President."
6133,c.j.,Sir?
6134,bartlet, I will take the pills.
6135,sam,"You know, here’s the thing."
6136,leo,Hmm?
6137,sam,We haven’t been invited yet.
6138,toby,What do you mean?
6139,sam,"Technically, the Speaker of the House invites the President to deliver the State of  the Union."
6140,toby,And we haven’t been invited yet?
6141,sam,Not yet.
6142,leo,Is somebody seeing to this?
6143,sam,I’ll take care of it.
6144,toby,"Good, cause you know, we want to be able to report that the country’s a lot stranger  than it was a year ago."
6145,sam,I’ll never be able to live it down.
6146,leo,No.
6147,c.j.,Get a doctor.
6148,bartlet,I don’t need a cardiogram.
6149,leo,Let’s go.
6150,bartlet,I got dizzy.
6151,leo,We’re going to the hospital.
6152,bartlet,"I didn’t have a heart attack, Leo. I got the flu, and I don’t need a cardiogram."
6153,leo, You think it’s pneumonia?
6154,bartlet,"Leo, I’m fine."
6155,bartlet,"Thank you, Mrs. Landingham... Mrs. Landingham how do I look to you?"
6156,bartlet, See?
6157,leo, What do you think?
6158,leo,"Do the blood work, send it to the lab, get the cardiogram and chest x-ray tomorrow."
6159,leo, You’re going to bed.
6160,bartlet,Can’t yet.
6161,leo,Mr. President?
6162,bartlet,Situation Room. 
6163,leo,"Alright, let’s do this, and then you’re going to bed.   We’ll meet you in the residence in a few minutes."
6164,josh,Whoa!
6165,bartlet,Just a little joke.
6166,toby,"You’re a real cut-up there, Mr. President."
6167,bartlet,101.9 and I still got it.
6168,sam,"Yes, indeed, sir."
6169,bartlet,Anybody know if the Celtics won tonight?
6170,leo,What’s going on?
6171,bartlet,It was a two-week cease-fire. There’s four days left.
6172,bartlet,What’s Intel saying about the Pakistanis?
6173,leo,Is this just whining or it’s for real?
6174,bartlet,They’ve got mine.
6175,leo,And they’ve got China’s.
6176,bartlet,I’m going to bed. But somebody call me if there’s movement.
6177,bartlet,Yeah?
6178,bartlet,Ugh. Good night.
6179,c.j., Hello.
6180,c.j.,I actually never thought about it.
6181,c.j.,What do you need?
6182,c.j.,"The fish is fine, and I need my office."
6183,c.j.,Yes.
6184,c.j.,Doesn’t seem to kill you.
6185,c.j.,What do you need?
6186,c.j.,Yes.
6187,c.j.,I was kidding.
6188,c.j.,I’m very dry.
6189,c.j.,Leo?
6190,c.j.,How do you know?
6191,c.j.,The whole thing?
6192,c.j.,I’ll go talk to him. 
6193,leo,That’s right.
6194,leo,It is.
6195,leo,It’s a technicality.
6196,leo,It dates back to Parliament! What do you want from me?
6197,leo,"Also, remind Josh to pick a guy."
6198,leo,Yeah.
6199,leo,Yeah.
6200,leo,Margaret!
6201,c.j., Excuse me.
6202,leo,"Oh, hey, C.J."
6203,c.j.,Hey.
6204,leo,What’s going on?
6205,c.j.,How’s the President?
6206,leo,He’s in bed. Hackett’s up there with him.
6207,c.j.,Does the first lady know?
6208,leo,She cancelled her trip. She’s on her way from Andrews.
6209,c.j.,Leo.
6210,leo,It’s gonna break... tomorrow?
6211,c.j.,"Yeah, it’s on the Internet right now."
6212,leo,Okay.
6213,c.j.,Why don’t we do a preemptive...
6214,leo,Yeah.
6215,c.j.,You’ll talk to the press in the morning?
6216,leo,Yeah.
6217,c.j.,"I’m gonna work with you first, okay?"
6218,leo,Yeah.
6219,c.j.,Okay... 
6220,bartlet," It tested very well. I’m not saying we’re doing it, Toby. I just want to  try it and see how it reads. The era of big government is over... All right. Thanks."
6221,bartlet,I’m feeling roughly the same as I was feeling when you asked me four minutes ago.
6222,bartlet,"It’s okay. This isn’t the worst of it, Charlie. The worst of it’s coming up the stairs  right now."
6224,bartlet,Hello.
6227,bartlet,Abbey?
6233,bartlet,I was wondering when you were gonna notice me.
6235,bartlet,No.
6240,bartlet,You’re very sexy when you’re in doctor mode you know that? Give me an IV/saline  solution and 100 milligrams of Flumadine. Stat.  I could jump you right now.
6242,bartlet,My thing’s more fun.
6244,bartlet,Fitzwallace called me in the Situation Room. There was more movement in Kashmir.
6246,bartlet,Abbey?
6248,bartlet,I broke the Steuben glass pitcher in the Oval Office.
6250,bartlet,"Seriously, Abbey, I’m fine."
6252,bartlet, But I didn’t.
6254,bartlet,Yeah.
6256,bartlet,I really don’t remember.
6258,bartlet,Fitzwallace says the Pakistanis are giving command control to some nuclear weapons  to the field.
6260,bartlet,I’m really sorry about the pitcher.
6262,bartlet,I could jump you right now.
6264,josh, Thank you.
6265,josh,Yes?
6267,josh,Yes.
6269,josh,Right.
6271,josh,Yeah.
6273,josh,Yeah.
6275,josh,Someone from the line of succession is required to be absent from the State of the Union.
6277,josh,Donna?
6280,josh,Yes.
6282,josh,Who do you think I should pick?
6284,josh,You think so?
6286,josh,And where exactly do you fall in the line of succession?
6288,josh,Fair point.
6290,josh,Roger Tribby.
6292,josh,"Yes.  Listen. Be sweet to Margaret and Leo today. This might not be the worst  day of their lives, but it’s got to be in the top five."
6294,josh,See ya later.
6295,leo,I deeply regret the pain and trouble this has caused for the people in my life...
6296,josh,"When you left Sierra Tucson, did you start attending meetings? "
6297,leo,A.A. meetings?
6298,c.j.,Don’t say A.A. if they don’t say A.A.
6299,josh," When you left Sierra Tucson, did you start attending meetings?"
6300,leo,Yes.
6301,josh,Do you still attend them?
6302,leo,Yes.
6303,c.j.,Where?
6304,leo,I won’t answer that.
6305,c.j.,How often?
6306,leo,"I won’t answer that, either."
6307,josh,How about as often as I need to?
6308,sam,Need?
6309,josh,He’s right.
6310,c.j.,Don’t answer it.
6311,leo,What else?
6312,sam,Has the President known?
6313,leo,The President and I have a long history and a close personal friendship...
6314,sam,You didn’t answer the question.
6315,leo,"The President has known, as well as the FBI and the Secret Service."
6316,c.j.,Did they raise any objection to a man with your problem in such a sensitive position?
6317,leo,"Yeah, they were concerned I’d sell state secrets to Bolivia for a quick..."
6318,josh,It’s not a totally unreasonable question.
6319,leo,"Yeah, I’m all set."
6320,c.j.,Okay.
6321,sam,"Uh, Leo, I wrote a draft to the President’s statement of support. I thought you might  want to..."
6322,leo, What did you do?
6323,sam,I wrote a draft to the President’s statement of support.
6324,leo,Who told you to do that?
6325,sam,The President’s in no condition...
6326,leo, I know what conditions he’s in. I’m asking who told you to write a statement  of support?
6327,josh,Toby told him last night to...
6328,sam,Nobody had to tell me. You’re about to get attacked. It’s what I do.
6329,leo,"No, your job isn’t to protect me, Sam. It’s to protect the President."
6330,sam,Leo...
6331,leo,"Do me a favor, Sam. Don’t show initiative. Don’t rush to my defense. I don’t want to  see you on Crossfire. I don’t want to see you on Larry King. I don’t want to read your  name in Newsweek unless it’s an advocacy of the President’s agenda.  I go down, I go down. I’m not taking anyone with me... Is that clear?"
6332,sam,"Yes, sir."
6333,leo,I’m all set. Go back to work.
6335,bartlet,Can I go to the office?
6337,bartlet,Why not?
6339,bartlet,Why?
6341,bartlet,Here’s the thing though. I never really saw you study while you were in med school.
6343,bartlet,Do you even know what you’re listening for right now? 
6345,bartlet, How many?
6347,bartlet,I’m going to the office.
6349,bartlet,Really?
6351,bartlet,Okay.
6352,bartlet,Uh-oh.
6354,bartlet,Alright. I think I’ll stay here for a little bit.
6356,leo,Mm-hmm?
6357,leo,Thank you.
6358,leo,No.
6359,leo,Good morning.
6360,leo,"A story, in which many, if not most of you, are aware of already, will break in wide  circulation by the end of the day. I’d like to take this opportunity to read a brief  statement before I answer your questions.   I deeply regret the pain and trouble this has caused for the people  in my life. I’d like to, at this point, clarify a few things..."
6362,josh,Yes.
6364,josh,"Because the secretaries of defense, state and treasury are famous faces, and we want  the camera to find them."
6366,josh,Yes.
6368,josh,It’s my country too.
6370,josh,Which is why I really don’t care that much.
6372,josh,"Donna, I really don’t anticipate the Capitol Building exploding."
6374,josh,Now you’re bringing me down.
6376,josh, Sam.
6377,sam,Yeah?
6378,josh,I thought he did well.
6379,sam,"Yeah, he did."
6380,josh,"I read the statement you wrote for the President--sensational, Sam. I’m sorry no one’s  gonna read it."
6381,sam,The President’s gonna read it. He’s reading it right now.
6382,josh,Sam?
6383,sam,I don’t care.
6384,josh,Leo’s gonna kill us!
6385,sam,I don’t care. Do you?
6386,josh,Nah.
6387,toby,They’re free to write they’re own speech.
6388,toby,What are your concerns?
6389,toby,I’ve pared down...
6390,toby,This is an opportunity for a pep rally. This is an opportunity to trumpet government.  Why do we want to pretend to be sorry for intruding?
6391,toby,So I’ve been told.
6392,toby,"Why don’t’ you pick your section of the speech. Fight with me about it, and I’ll lose,  and then I can call in the next group."
6393,toby,Pick a section. There’s a line waiting outside. I’ve got 31 hours to-to write this...
6394,toby,The N.E.A.?  Let us open our hymnals to page 22.
6395,leo,Okay.
6396,leo,"Hey, Mal. "
6397,leo,I’m fine.
6398,leo,I told you that I didn’t know...
6399,leo,It’s okay.
6400,leo,"Oh, yes, definitely a picture of me standing next to my estranged wife--"
6401,leo,Mallory?
6402,leo,Okay... Anyway...
6403,leo, What statement?
6404,leo,It’s floating around?
6405,leo,Excuse me. 
6406,sam,Pages one and two.
6407,josh,Sam.
6408,sam,Yeah?
6409,josh,Where are we at?
6410,sam,We’re getting slapped around on the N.E.A.
6411,josh,"Oh, man! Why is he...?"
6412,sam,Josh.
6413,josh,I mean N.E.A. is putting up a fight...
6414,leo,You did it again.
6415,josh,Leo...
6416,leo, You did it again!
6417,josh,I understand you’re being pissed off--
6418,leo,Has the President seen it?
6419,josh,"Yes, and he--"
6420,leo,Who gave it to him?
6421,josh,Leo?
6422,leo,Who gave it to him?
6423,josh,I did.
6424,sam,I did.
6425,leo,"What, you’re giving me Abbott and Costello?"
6426,sam,I did.
6427,leo,I told you...
6428,sam,"They want to tear you down, plain and simple. They don’t like you and this is what  they do, and for us not to defend you? I disobeyed you. I apologize, but that’s the  way it is."
6429,leo,Yeah?
6430,leo,Thank you. 
6436,leo, Hey.
6438,leo,"Oh, no, no, no. Mallory, would you mind...?"
6439,leo, Mallory?!
6442,leo,Thank you.
6444,leo,Well...
6446,leo,Did the fever go back up?
6448,leo,Abbey? What’s going on?
6450,leo,What should I know that I don’t know?
6452,leo,Why’d you cancel your trip?
6454,leo,Because that President has a temperature. The President’s not in nursery school.
6456,leo,"It’s not a problem to postpone. Of course, I wouldn’t do anything to jeopardize the  President’s health. What I’m saying..."
6458,leo," Hey, hey, hey. This is me. This has happened before. I see you trying to  cover the panic. I see you prescribing medication. I think you’re giving him shots.  What does he have he can’t tell people?"
6460,leo,"Ugh! You would not have come back for the flu, Abbey."
6462,leo,Abbey?
6464,leo," Oh, Abbey."
6466,bartlet,I don’t understand. Don’t any of these characters have jobs?
6467,bartlet,They seem to have a lot of free time in the middle of the day.
6468,bartlet,And that woman’s changed her clothes for quite a lot in one afternoon.
6469,bartlet,"Yeah. Would you mind stepping out, Charlie?"
6470,bartlet,"Abbey phoned me up and told me about your conversation. I was diagnosed about seven years  ago. My life expectancy is normal. My particular course of MS is relapsing-remitting,  which means I should experience total recovery after attacks. Abbey gives me injections  of something called Betaseron, and that reduces the frequency. Fever and stress tend to  be two things that induces attacks."
6471,leo,"Well, you’re the President of the United States, you’re delivering the State of the Union  tomorrow night, India and Pakistan are pointing nuclear weapons at each other, and you  have a 102-degree fever. So I guess we’re out of the woods, hmm?"
6472,bartlet,101.9.
6473,leo,"Jed, of all the things you could’ve kept from me..."
6474,bartlet,You haven’t called me “Jed” since I was elected.
6475,leo, Why didn’t you tell me?
6476,bartlet,‘Cause I wanted to be the President.
6477,leo,That wouldn’t have stopped me from getting you here. And I could’ve been a friend.
6478,bartlet,You’ve been a friend.
6479,leo,But when it was time to really...
6480,bartlet,I know.
6481,leo,"When I was lying on my face in the motel parking lot, you were the one I called."
6482,bartlet,"When you stood up there today, I was so proud. I wanted to be with you."
6483,leo,Nah. Nah.
6484,bartlet,"I tried to get up, but I fell back down again."
6485,leo,I know the feeling.
6486,bartlet," I’m so sorry, Leo. I really am."
6487,leo,Don’t worry about it.
6488,bartlet,"Yeah, Charlie?"
6489,bartlet,"Yeah, give us a minute, would you please?"
6490,toby,The National Endowment amounts to less than 1/100th of one percent of the total budget  for the federal government. It costs taxpayers 39 cents a year. The arts budget for the  U.S. is equivalent to the arts budget of Sweden.
6491,toby,"You gay bashing, Raymond?"
6492,toby,"I’d start by telling them that Rodgers and Hammerstein wrote Oklahoma, and Arthur Murray  taught ballroom dance, and Arthur Miller did need the N.E.A. to write Death of a Salesman,  but it wasn’t called the N.E.A. back then. It was called W.P.A. and it was Roosevelt’s...  It was Roosevelt’s..."
6493,toby,Yeah?
6494,toby,Thank you everybody. This meeting is over.
6495,bartlet,And a strong shot of whiskey?
6496,bartlet,"What have you got for me, John?"
6497,bartlet,Buy them?
6498,bartlet,How?
6499,leo,"Lord Marbury, under our Constitution, our President is not empowered to create maharajas."
6500,bartlet,"John, please."
6501,bartlet,What does India want?
6502,leo,Why?
6503,leo,For avoiding a war halfway around the world?
6504,bartlet,"Your friend, the prime minister?"
6505,bartlet,He’s gonna go for this?
6506,bartlet,"All right, you tell the ambassador we’ll discuss this in three months. In three months,  John. I don’t want this to be like quid pro quo."
6507,bartlet,"That’s the carrot. Leo, what’s the stick?"
6508,leo,"In the next 24 hours, we want to see recon photos of Indian divisions retreating. If we  don’t, we’re gonna seize Indian assets and so will our NATO allies, and G-7’s gonna call  in its loans."
6509,bartlet,"They put command-control in the field, John, and we’re gonna get physical. You make damn  sure they know that."
6510,bartlet,Talk to the ambassador. I want Fitzwallace to have photos in 24 hours.
6511,bartlet,"Yes, Charlie?"
6512,bartlet,"Toby, come in please."
6513,leo,I’m gonna go back to the office.
6514,bartlet,Let’s hope.
6515,toby, Leo.
6516,leo,"Hey, Toby. "
6517,toby,"How you feeling, Mr. President?"
6518,bartlet,Much better. Thank you.
6519,toby,Good.
6520,bartlet,"You know, I was watching a television program before with a sort of a roving moderator  who spoke to a seated panel of young women who are having some sort of problems with  their boyfriends. Apparently, because the boyfriends have all slept with the girlfriend’s  mothers. Then they brought all the boyfriends out and they fought right there on television.  Toby, tell me, these people don’t vote, do they?"
6521,toby,I wouldn’t think so. No sir.
6522,josh," Excuse me, Mr. President."
6523,bartlet,"What do you need, Josh?"
6524,toby,"I asked Josh to join me here, sir."
6525,bartlet, What’s on your mind?
6526,toby,The era of big government is over.
6527,bartlet,You want to cut the line?
6528,toby,"I want to change the sentiment. We’re running away from ourselves, and I know we can score  points that way. I was the principle architect in that campaign strategy, right along with  you, Josh. But we’re here now. Tomorrow night, we do an immense thing. We have to say what  we feel. That government, no matter what its failures are in the past, and in times to come,  for that matter, the government can be a place where people come together and where no one  gets left behind. No one... gets left behind, an instrument of... good.   I have no trouble understanding why the line tested well, Josh, but I don’t think  that means we should say it. I think that means we should... change it."
6529,bartlet,"I think so, too.  What do you think, Josh?"
6530,josh,"I’d make it a point never to disagree with Toby when he’s right, Mr. President."
6531,bartlet,Then you and Sam get your people together and get to work.
6532,toby,"Thank you, Mr. President."
6533,bartlet,Thank you.
6534,josh, You’re jealous ‘cause Danny was flirting with Mandy.
6535,c.j.,I didn’t say that. When did I say that?
6536,josh,I read between the lines.
6537,c.j.,There are no lines.
6538,sam,"You know, C.J., it can be pretty confusing sometimes. I mean I’m at this place with  Mallory, where I don’t know if she likes me. I don’t know if she doesn’t like me.  I don’t know if she’s indifferent altogether. I just wish she’d take the bull by the  horns and get past it so we can move on."
6539,sam,"Uh, yes."
6540,sam,"Well, now I’m even more confused."
6541,josh,Yes.
6542,sam,"Though, I gotta say, I’m enjoying being a writer."
6543,c.j.,"Carol, is Danny Concannon in the Press Room?"
6544,c.j.,"Would you have him come to my office, please?"
6546,bartlet,Abbey...?
6548,bartlet,You’ve taken it 14 times in the last three hours. You’re not taking it again.
6550,bartlet,At least not with a thermometer.
6552,bartlet,I’m saying if you want to take it recreationally...
6554,bartlet,"Yes, I do."
6556,bartlet,I stopped asking those questions.
6557,c.j.,So... you have asked me out many times. I have said no.
6558,c.j.,That was a business dinner.
6559,c.j.,"Nonetheless, I do seem to have a preoccupation, um, sort of girlish, I suppose, thing,  which, um... and please don’t be in any way mislead by anything... in fact, let me put  it this way..."
6560,c.j.,"I thought what I’d do is kiss you, you know, on the mouth, then I’d just get past it...  I’d just get past it, and I’ll be able to give my work the kind of concentration it  really deserves."
6561,c.j.,How’s right here?
6562,c.j.,Be careful of the fish. 
6563,c.j.,"No, I’m saying cause if you rock against the..."
6564,c.j.,"Oh, good."
6565,c.j.,Yeah.
6566,c.j.,"Okay, I got to go now. "
6567,c.j.,Yeah?
6568,c.j.,No.
6569,c.j.,Yes.
6572,bartlet,Good evening.
6573,bartlet,"Thank you, John."
6574,bartlet,"Godspeed, your Lordship."
6575,leo,"Good luck, John."
6576,bartlet,"Friends, let me have your attention please. A lot of time, energy, passion, wit, skill,  and talent went into drafting this, and while you might not know it from my delivery  later, this is an extraordinary speech. And I say thee yea! Toby Ziegler, and I say  thee yea! Sam Seaborn!"
6577,bartlet,Roger.
6578,bartlet,"Roger, I’m sorry you drew the short straw on this. We’ll miss you tonight. Next year,  it’ll be the surgeon general, I promise. Meanwhile, you can watch TV at my study."
6579,bartlet,"Oh, thank you."
6580,bartlet,What is it?
6581,bartlet,This is magnificent.
6582,bartlet," “He shall, from time to time, give to the Congress information on the state of  the union and recommend to their consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary  and expedient.”"
6583,bartlet,"Thank you, Roger."
6584,bartlet,"Oh, Roger, if anything happened, you know what to do, right?"
6585,bartlet,"First thing always is national security. Get your commanders together. Appoint joint  chiefs. Appoint chairman. Take them to Defcon 4. Have the governor send emergency  delegates to Washington. The assistant attorney general is gonna be the acting A.G.  If he tells you he wants to bring out the National Guard, do what he tells you."
6586,bartlet,You have a best friend?
6587,bartlet,Is he smarter than you?
6588,bartlet,Would you trust him with your life?
6589,bartlet,That’s your chief of staff.
6590,bartlet,"Oh, in the residence, in the second floor, the bathroom at the end of the hall.  You have to jiggle the handle a little."
6591,bartlet,I got to go.  You’ll do fine. People have phenomenal capacity.
6592,c.j.,...weather permitting we'll be in the rose garden. 
6593,c.j.,If it's not raining. 
6594,c.j.,I know. 
6595,c.j.,I know. 
6596,c.j.,"This President is from New England and I think it's time we all started getting used  to that. At least, that's what he told me this morning. What else do we have here?  There will be 15 pen recipients. The President will sign the bill with 15 pens, and  I guess someone on my staff wanted you to know that. "
6597,c.j.,Tell me you don't have a question about the pens. 
6598,c.j.,"Yes, Danny? "
6599,c.j.,Danny... 
6600,c.j.,"You know you were the only one in the room doing the math on that, right? "
6601,c.j.,Only one in the room. 
6602,c.j.," 15 pens, 13 letters, they must have stuck something in here  about... Yes... he's gonna... interesting... he's gonna literally dot the I"" and  cross the ""T""s. "
6603,c.j.,Freakboy. 
6604,c.j.,"Jonathon and Jennifer Lydell, the parents of Lowell Lydell, have been added to the  guest list; also added to the guest list are senators... "
6605,c.j.,Yeah? 
6606,c.j.,What still on? 
6607,c.j.,Yeah. 
6608,c.j.,"I've heard that too, and I don't know where it got started; it's ridiculous. The  President's signing hate crimes legislation, Jonathan and Jennifer Lydell's son was  killed for being gay. They're obviously going to..."
6609,c.j.,The Lydells are coming. 
6610,c.j.,Yeah. Where was I? 
6611,c.j.,Breach and Larkin. Senators Breach and Larkin will be attending as well. 
6612,c.j.,"Listen, you've been a great audience, don't forget to tip your waitresses. That's all  the news today, you're outta here. "
6613,c.j.,Done what? 
6614,c.j.,They're not coming? 
6615,c.j.,Mandy! 
6616,c.j.,I spoke the mother on the phone. I spoke to her twice! 
6617,c.j.,What's wrong with the father? 
6618,c.j.,That's it? 
6619,c.j.,He doesn't say much? 
6620,c.j.,Their son was just murdered Mandy! Did you want him to wear a campaign button? 
6621,c.j.,Are you listening to yourself? 
6622,c.j.,You want me to audition the Lydells? 
6623,c.j.,Fine. 
6624,c.j.,"Carol? Dotting the ""I""s and crossing the ""T""s, thank you for that. "
6625,c.j.,You misspelled senator. 
6626,c.j.,Hello. 
6627,josh,We've got a bit of a sticky wicket. 
6628,c.j.,Please don't tell me I'm staying here and working late tonight. 
6629,josh,I need you to read a report. 
6630,c.j.,"I'm a woman in her prime, Josh. I'm a prime woman. "
6631,josh,"There's no doubt about it, but I need you to read this anyway. "
6632,c.j.,What is it? 
6633,josh,"We want Congress to sign off on funds for a hundred thousand new teachers. They say,  fine, but you gotta stipulate that in Sex Ed classes.... "
6634,c.j.,Abstinence only? 
6635,josh,Yes. 
6636,c.j.,I would no have trouble passing such a class. 
6637,josh,"We commissioned a report about a year ago on Sex Education in public schools, and,  well, this is it. "
6638,c.j.,What's it say? 
6639,josh,It's not good. 
6640,c.j.,How's it not good? 
6641,josh,It says basically that teaching abstinence only doesn't work- that people are going  to be prone to have sex whether they're cautioned against it or not. 
6642,c.j.,"Well, what are they recommending? "
6643,josh,"Something called ""abstinence plus"". "
6644,c.j.,Abstinence plus? 
6645,josh,Yes. 
6646,c.j.,What's that mean? 
6647,josh,"Well, Sam's renamed it 'everything but'. "
6648,c.j.,Everything but? 
6649,josh,Yes. 
6650,c.j.,Ah. 
6651,josh,Yes. 
6652,c.j.,They want teachers to teach... 
6653,josh,Yes. 
6654,c.j.,And so the sticky wicket joke was...? 
6655,josh,A regrettable pun. Should I order you some food? 
6656,c.j.,"Y'know, I can't remember the last time I got home before midnight. "
6657,josh,"By the way, pages 27 to 33? A couple of things every girl should know. "
6658,c.j.,Get me a salad. 
6659,c.j.,Hey. 
6660,c.j.,With you? 
6661,c.j.,I have to read a report on Sex Education. 
6662,c.j.,"I'm anticipating any joke you could possibly make right now, and I'm not finding any  of them funny. "
6663,c.j.,I didn't grab you... 
6664,c.j.,I didn't grab you. You grabbed me!
6665,c.j.,That's because... 
6666,c.j.,What do you want? 
6667,c.j.,Are you kidding me? 
6668,c.j.,How do you know about this? 
6669,c.j.,What kind of White House source? 
6670,c.j.,I'll find out about it. 
6671,c.j.,Okay. 
6672,c.j.,"Wait.  Okay, you can go now. "
6675,josh, Yeah? 
6677,josh,Did they burn the hamburger? 
6679,josh,Did you check? 
6681,josh,Let's go. 
6682,josh,I like it where if you dropped it on the floor it would break. 
6684,josh,Friday. 
6686,josh,Any stories we have to give the press that we're not wild about we give all in a lump  on Friday. 
6688,josh,Instead of one at a time? 
6690,josh,"They've got X column inches to fill, right? They're gonna fill them no matter what. "
6692,josh,"So if we give them one story, that story's X column inches. "
6694,josh,They're a fifth the size. 
6696,josh,Because no one reads the paper on Saturday. 
6698,josh,The salad's for C.J.. 
6699,toby,Yeah? 
6700,sam,There is a town in Alabama that wants to abolish all laws except the Ten Commandments. 
6701,toby,I saw it. 
6702,sam,"Well, they're gonna have a problem. "
6703,toby,Because the Constitution prohibits religious activity in any form connected to Government? 
6704,sam,Good point! Two problems. 
6705,toby,"Sam, I'm busy here! "
6706,sam,I just mean that some of those Commandments are pretty hard to enforce. 
6707,toby,What is it? 
6708,sam,I just got a call asking me if I wanted to comment on a story that's gonna run in the  Georgetown Hoya tomorrow. 
6709,toby,The student newspaper? 
6710,sam,"A sociology professor has been teaching what the paper, at any rate, feels is racist  stuff. Too much funding for Head Start, welfare mothers, and... "
6711,toby,And why are they talking to us? 
6712,sam,Zoey's in the class. 
6713,toby,Who cares? 
6714,sam,This minute? The Georgetown Hoya. Tomorrow...? 
6715,toby,"The President's daughter got an idiot sociology professor, and we gotta... "
6716,sam,I'll talk to Zoey. 
6717,toby,Please.  What else? 
6718,sam,"Coveting thy neighbour's wife, for example. How are you going to enforce that one? "
6719,toby,Sam! 
6720,sam,"We never have our chats anymore, Toby. "
6721,toby,What chats? 
6722,sam,Our late night chats! 
6723,toby,Did we ever do that? 
6724,sam, No. 
6725,leo, Fellows? 
6726,sam,Hey. 
6727,leo,My office. 
6728,sam,"Leo, did you know there's a town in Alabama that wants to... "
6729,leo,Yes. 
6730,sam,What do you think? 
6731,leo,Coveting thy neighbour's wife's gonna cause some problems. 
6732,sam,"That's what I said. Plus, if I were arrested for coveting my neighbour's wife, I'd  probably bear false witness. "
6733,josh,Hey. 
6734,leo,Josh! This Sex Ed report could not have possibly come at a worse time. 
6735,josh,I know. 
6736,leo,A hundred thousand school teachers... 
6737,josh,I know. 
6738,leo,He's going to sign the hate crimes bill! 
6739,toby,"He didn't write the thing, Leo. "
6740,leo,"I'm saying I wish we'd have gotten some heads up it was coming, and what was in it. "
6741,toby,"Well, that horse left the barn! "
6742,leo,We're going to have to deal with it tomorrow. 
6743,toby,Yeah. 
6744,leo,What else? What's this thing on the Hill? 
6745,josh,"Sam and me, we're meeting with Bruno from an appropriation sub-committee that has  jurisdiction over the White House budget. "
6746,leo,Is this about me? 
6747,josh,"Technically, it's about me. They want to know why I withheld information gained during  Inspector Javert's drug search... Yeah, it's about you. "
6748,toby,Um... Can I just say a word about that? 
6749,leo,No. 
6750,toby,It was absolutely the right thing to do under the circumstances. 
6751,leo,I understand. You're going with them? 
6752,sam,Yeah. 
6753,leo,Okay. I'm sorry I've made you guys have to... 
6754,sam,Leo... 
6755,josh,Please! 
6760,josh,Sure. 
6762,josh,"We'll need to ask Sam, don't you think? "
6764,josh, Sam! 
6765,sam,"Yes, sir? "
6766,josh,"Donna needs to talk to us, and it doesn't look good. "
6768,josh,Chad Magrudian? 
6770,josh,Didn't he used to work for us? 
6771,sam,He kept screwing up. 
6772,josh,How? 
6773,sam,He advanced the Puerto Rico trip and spent a half a day scuba diving. Which was nowhere  on the President's itinerary. He advanced the New York trip and got impossible tickets  to something that the President had no intention of seeing. 
6774,josh,He's working for Hoynes now? 
6776,sam,He played 18 holes on Pebble Beach. 
6778,sam,He wasn't supposed to take a Navy helicopter and make it wait. 
6779,josh,"Well, what does this have to do with us? "
6781,c.j.,Hi. 
6782,toby,You remember Chad Magrudian? 
6783,c.j.,The advance man? 
6784,toby,Yeah. He took a ride... 
6785,c.j.,I know about this already. The round of golf? 
6786,toby,How do you know? 
6787,c.j.,Danny got it from a White House source. 
6788,toby,Danny gave it to you? 
6789,c.j.,Any problem with that? 
6790,toby,As long as it wasn't the other way round. That was a joke! 
6791,c.j.,It better have been. What else? 
6792,c.j.,What else? 
6793,toby,"There's going to be a thing with Zoey. Her sociology professor's teaching some things,  and we're going to get her out of class. "
6794,c.j.,Okay. 
6795,toby,You can dump that out with the trash. 
6796,c.j.,Okay. 
6797,toby,And I was kidding before. 
6798,c.j.,"I don't leak stories to Danny. If you don't believe me, ask Danny. "
6799,toby,I do believe you. 
6800,c.j.,Good. 
6801,toby,You okay by yourself? 
6802,c.j.,Why wouldn't I be okay? 
6803,toby,Okay... Night. 
6804,josh,"Her name is Karen Larsen. She worked on the Vice-President's campaign and in his public  affairs office. Aides thought she was getting a bit of a crush on Hoynes, so they moved  her further away. "
6805,toby,Where? 
6806,sam,Glad you asked. 
6807,toby,Personnel? 
6808,josh,Yeah. 
6809,toby,How high is her FBI clearance? 
6810,sam,High enough. 
6811,josh,I think we've found our man. 
6812,toby,"Sam, have a talk with her when you get back from the Hill. "
6813,sam,Yeah. 
6814,leo,"The way the European Union's set up, the rules favor the import of bananas from Latin  American countries that used to be European colonies. "
6815,bartlet,"I don't want to spend the whole day talking about bananas. Good morning Nancy, good  morning Mrs. Landingham. "
6816,bartlet,No. 
6817,bartlet,I really don't want a banana. 
6818,bartlet,"Yes, thank you. "
6819,bartlet,I'm done talking to you now. 
6820,bartlet,"Good Morning everyone. Sit down, sit down please. "
6821,leo,The point they're gonna make is that the rules discriminate against bananas from poorer  Latin American countries. 
6822,bartlet,Are we a poor Latin American country? 
6823,leo,No. 
6824,bartlet,Then why am I having this conversation? 
6825,leo,Because the bananas grown in those countries are sold by American companies. 
6826,bartlet,I'm in trouble with Chiquita and Dole? 
6827,leo,"Well, it's not you so much as... Yeah, it's mostly you. "
6828,bartlet,Toby. 
6829,toby,"Yes, sir? "
6830,bartlet,"We have appointed five people to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. Republicans  in the House, as well as an alarming number of Democrats, have been holding up those  appointments. "
6831,toby,I've been fully briefed. 
6832,bartlet,"As far as I can tell, their reluctance has little, if anything, to do with bananas. "
6833,toby,I'm meeting with some key people this afternoon. 
6834,bartlet,You're all set? 
6835,toby,I was raised on Sesame Street. I was raised on Julia Child. I was raised on Brideshead  Revisited. Their legacies are safe in my hands. 
6836,toby, You've got a problem? 
6837,c.j., You watched cooking shows? 
6838,toby,I watched Miss Julia Child. 
6839,c.j.,Okay. 
6840,leo,C.J.? Mandy talk to you about the Lydells? 
6841,c.j.,Yeah. 
6842,bartlet,You're going to sit with them? 
6843,c.j.,When they get in this afternoon. 
6844,bartlet,And talk to the father. 
6845,c.j.,"Yes, sir. "
6846,bartlet,"The mother too, but I'm concerned about the father. "
6847,c.j.,"Sir, if you don't mind me asking, what exactly is the nature of your concern? "
6848,leo,"Mandy says he's withdrawn, that he doesn't say much. "
6849,c.j.,I don't understand... His son was just killed. 
6850,leo,His son was just killed because he was gay. 
6851,c.j.,And...? 
6852,bartlet,This is no time to out a guy in front and center who's embarrassed that his son was gay. 
6853,c.j.,Really? 
6854,leo,"Fathers and sons, C.J.. This guy sells dental supplies in the Twin Cities, so how  enlightened do you think he's going to be? "
6855,c.j.,Yeah... but his son just died. 
6856,bartlet,Sit and talk to them. 
6857,c.j.,"Yes, sir. "
6858,leo,Was that it? 
6859,c.j.,"Mr. President, I was wondering if you had an opportunity to look at the Sex Education  report? "
6860,bartlet,I haven't had chance yet. 
6861,c.j.,Because it's very dramatic and I think we should talk about the right form with which  to present it to the public. 
6862,bartlet,Give me a chance to look it over and we'll talk at the end of the day. 
6863,c.j.,"Yes, sir, thank you. "
6864,bartlet,"Josh and Sam, wait up a second. Leo, don't go away.  Excuse us a second. Thank you. "
6865,bartlet, What time are you going up to the Hill? 
6866,josh,Noon. 
6867,bartlet,"I want to pre-empt a hearing. I don't want it. I don't want it for Leo. I don't want  it for his family. I don't want it for us. They know that, and they're gonna play ""Let's  Make a Deal."" Don't take anything off the table until you've talked to me. You understand? "
6868,josh,"Yes, sir. "
6869,bartlet,"Okay. Unless a war breaks out, I'll be spending much of my day talking about bananas. "
6870,sam,"Godspeed to you, sir. "
6871,bartlet,Thank you. 
6872,josh,"Thank you, Mr President. "
6873,bartlet,Alright.  Is Simon Blye coming in to meet with  you today? 
6874,leo,How did you know that? 
6875,bartlet,I broke into your secret schedule compartment and took infrared photos with my compact  camera.  
6876,leo,Sir... 
6877,bartlet,"Margaret told me. Look, why are you meeting with that man? "
6878,leo,He's a good friend. 
6879,bartlet,"No, he's not. "
6880,leo,He's been a good friend to me. 
6881,bartlet,"In good times, Leo. It's not hard to like a guy when he's doing well. The measure of a  man is, how does he behave when things are otherwise? "
6882,leo,I need some counsel. 
6883,bartlet,"That you couldn't get from me? Or Toby, or Josh, or Sam, or C.J.? "
6884,leo,"I didn't mean that, Mr. President.. "
6885,bartlet,I know you... 
6886,leo,"And of course, your counsel is valued above all else. I just meant, I can use all the  help I can get. "
6887,bartlet,"You put a lot of faith in people, Leo, and I love you for that. I just don't want to  see you get disappointed. "
6888,leo,"Yes, sir. "
6889,bartlet,Especially now. 
6890,leo,"Yes, sir. "
6891,bartlet,Okay. 
6892,leo," Oh, at some point, you've got to read the Sex Ed report. "
6893,bartlet,I will. 
6894,leo,"Thank you, sir. "
6895,bartlet,Thank you. 
6896,c.j.,Hey. 
6897,c.j.,Tell me something. 
6898,c.j.,Are we off the record? 
6899,c.j.,Are we? 
6900,c.j.,Feels like we're still on the record. 
6901,c.j., Never mind. 
6902,c.j.,It was nothing. 
6903,c.j.,I understand. 
6904,c.j.,There won't be any more kissing. 
6905,c.j.,"Is it possible that a father could be embarrassed about his son being gay, even after  his son was murdered? "
6906,c.j.,"Possible to the extent that he'd be disinclined to support a law that would impose  stiffer penalties upon the perpetrators of hate crimes, including the ones who tied  his 17 year old son to a tree and threw rocks at his head? "
6907,c.j.,It eludes me. 
6908,c.j.,Okay. 
6909,c.j.,I'll have information for you Friday. 
6910,c.j.,"He's a C-level aide to the Vice President, Danny. He's resigning. You want to run a  special section? "
6911,c.j.,A job you're uniquely suited for. 
6912,c.j.,Goodbye. 
6913,c.j.,"Okay, you should go now. "
6914,c.j.,"Yes, then... I should go. "
6915,sam,"Yes, sir. "
6916,leo,Is he here? 
6917,leo,Send him in. 
6918,leo,Simon. Thanks so much for coming. 
6919,leo,Was there any trouble getting here? 
6920,leo,How's Meredith? 
6921,leo,"Well, you built the house, Simon."
6922,leo,Okay. 
6923,sam,"This past November the 21st, Congressman Lillienfield announced, in a sort of reckless  fashion, that one in three White House staffers was on drugs. "
6924,josh,"We were in the midst of announcing our nominee for the Supreme Court, so there was a  certain amount of... "
6925,josh,Yes. 
6926,josh,Thank you. 
6927,sam,'Investigate' is a word that gets us into some trouble. 
6928,josh,There's a first clients. 
6929,josh,That's right. 
6930,josh,Under the Freedom of Information Act. 
6931,sam,Sure. 
6932,leo,That's right. 
6933,leo,Yeah. 
6934,leo,"Josh and Sam are pretty good. And Bruno's a reasonable guy, so... "
6935,leo,Simon... 
6936,leo,"Simon, did you come here to tell me you think I should resign? "
6937,leo,I've offered the President my resignation; he won't accept it. 
6938,leo,"Simon, I'm just taking a guess - is there an op-ed piece coming out that I should know  about? "
6939,leo,"No, I don't need to see it. I know what it says. For the good of the party, for the good  of the President, a leading Democrat comes out in the Post and calls for my resignation.  That probably won't get much attention... "
6940,leo,...and it will definitely not distract from the President's agenda. 
6941,leo,"I haven't seen you making the rounds on the Sunday morning talk shows in a while, Simon.  I'm glad I could help out! "
6942,leo,"Tell me something - where's your grave concern for country, party, and President, when  you're out whoring for Atlantic Oil? "
6943,leo,"Well, God, I sure didn't mean to hurt your feelings! "
6944,leo," I think you should walk out of here now.  As a matter of fact, I think you should run. "
6945,leo,Oh God. 
6946,josh,For how long? 
6947,sam,That's almost a year. 
6948,josh,You want the White House to keep it in a drawer for a year? 
6949,josh,Why? 
6950,josh,We put this thing in a drawer for a year and you can guarantee us... 
6951,sam,The President will never go for it. 
6952,josh,Leo McGarry hasn't done anything wrong. Neither has anyone else. The hearings aren't going  to turn up anything. We're not frightened enough to suppress... 
6953,toby,It's not television for rich people. 
6954,toby,"It's not television for rich people. In fact, the public television audience is a fairly  accurate reflection of the social and economic make up of the United States. , which is one percent better than the commercial TV audience.  So what are you talking to me about? "
6955,c.j.,Are they here? 
6956,c.j.,Why don't you get Mandy? 
6957,c.j.,She's in the Oval Office having what must be a very comfortable conversation with the  President. 
6958,bartlet,"""By the age of 14, more than 25 percent have touched a girl's..."" I won't say that word.   "
6959,bartlet,Yes? 
6960,bartlet,Go. 
6961,bartlet,Thank you.
6962,bartlet,With you? 
6963,bartlet,No. 
6964,bartlet,Because I'd rather not be in therapy for the rest of my life. 
6965,c.j.,Mr. and Mrs. Lydell? 
6966,c.j.,I'm C.J. Cregg. And you've already met Mandy? 
6967,c.j.,"Please sit.  We want to thank you for coming such a long way, particularly  so soon after this unspeakable tragedy. "
6968,c.j.,"Mrs. Lydell, that's why we asked to talk to you for a minute. It was Mandy's impression -  and perhaps it was mistaken - that you and your husband... uh... have some reservations  about appearing in support of the President. I hate to have to put it so bluntly, but is  that true? "
6969,c.j.,Mr. Lydell? 
6970,c.j.,"I'm sorry. I was asking... Mr. Lydell, I don't know how else to put this. But if you  appear in front of the press to be at all embarrassed about your son's homosexuality...  I guess... let me just say this, do you support the President? "
6971,c.j.,Mandy... 
6972,c.j.,They'll be fine. 
6973,c.j.,Mandy... 
6974,c.j.,"So, the press surrounds them. He says what he says. "
6975,c.j.,"He made a reasonable point. And maybe, given the circumstances, he's got a right. "
6976,c.j.,Yeah. Maybe. Yeah. 
6977,c.j.,They said they support the bill. 
6978,c.j., What else... I'm saying... 
6979,c.j., Yeah. All right. All right. I know. I know. 
6980,c.j.,I know. 
6981,c.j.,"No. No, I'll do it. "
6982,toby,Because people want to claim they're more sophisticated than they are. 
6983,toby,Look... 
6984,toby,Fozzy Bear. 
6985,toby," It's Fozzy Bear, not Fuzzy Bear. "
6986,toby,It's a perfectly reasonable complaint. 
6987,toby,I don't care. 
6988,toby,"We're gonna see to all those things. In the meantime, a time when the public is rightly  concerned about the impact of sex and violence on TV this administration is gonna protect  the muppets, we're gonna protect Wall-street Week, we're gonna protect Live from Lincoln  Center and by god, we are going to protect Julia Childs."
6989,toby,Hang on.
6990,c.j.,I got a message you wanted to see me? 
6991,toby,I've got good news. 
6992,c.j.,What? 
6993,toby,"Josh and Sam cut a deal on the hill. No hearing for Leo, he's gonna be out of the woods. "
6994,c.j.,"Oh Toby, that's, that's great. "
6995,toby,I gotta get back in there. This is just too much fun. 
6996,sam,"Cathy, there is a small town in Alabama that wants to pass a law saying if I don't honor  my father I go to jail. What do you think about that? "
6997,sam,"Yeah, I think they've overlooked that. "
6998,sam,Send her in. 
6999,sam, Are you Karen Larson? 
7000,sam,I'm Sam Seaborn. 
7001,sam," The advance man you ratted out doesn't work for us  anymore Karen, he works for the Vice President. Kind of screwed yourself there, didn't you? "
7002,sam,You trying to win one for the Vice President? 
7003,sam,Were you? 
7004,sam,"I've got four witnesses, Karen. I've got Ginger in my office, I have a guy from political  liaison and I have two wire service reporters. Were you trying to protect your boss? "
7005,sam,There are people here that say you've been acting funny. Like you're guilty and you've got  something to hide. They think you're the one who leaked the story about the advance man.  I'm thinking something different. 
7006,sam,I don't give a damn about the round of golf. I don't give a damn about the helicopter.  I don't give a damn about the advance man.  Were you the one who leaked Leo McGarry's personnel file to Lillianfield and  Claypool? 
7007,sam,What? 
7008,sam,CATHY! 
7009,bartlet,Mrs. Landingham. 
7010,bartlet,You're not going to believe this but I think I'd actually like a banana. 
7011,bartlet,Why not? 
7012,bartlet,I wasn't snippy! 
7013,bartlet,"Thank you, Mrs. Landingham. "
7014,bartlet,She withholds food from me. 
7015,c.j.,"Mr. President, I hate to keep jumping up and down on this, but... "
7016,bartlet,The sex-ed report. 
7017,c.j.,Yes sir. 
7018,bartlet,We're gonna leave it alone for a while. 
7019,c.j.,"Sir, when you say... "
7020,bartlet, After the midterm elections. 
7021,c.j.,That's a year from now. 
7022,bartlet,Yeah. 
7023,c.j.,We're gonna stick it in a drawer? 
7024,bartlet,It's a pretty incendiary report. 
7025,c.j.,You don't think we have an obligation to present the information? 
7026,bartlet," It's not gonna play well at a PTA meeting, C.J.  It says we should be teaching kids to have sex. "
7027,c.j.,"It does not, Mr. President, excuse me sir, but it does not. "
7028,bartlet,Of course it doesn't. But that's how it's going to play. 
7029,c.j.,"The report is very direct, sir, it says with holding knowledge about having sex doesn't  prevent teenagers from having sex, it prevents teenagers from having sex safely. And it  says offering information about safe sex doesn't increase the rate of sex, it increases  the rate of protected sex. "
7030,bartlet, C.J. 
7031,c.j.,"We commissioned this report, Mr. President. These people are doctors; we asked them a  question. How can we put it in a drawer just cause we don't think people are going to  like the answer? "
7032,bartlet,"C.J., getting it through this congress, a body which at the moment, will only give federal  funding to sex education programs that teach abstinence only. "
7033,c.j.,We have an enormous pulpit from which... 
7034,bartlet, And we will avail ourselves of that pulpit but we will do it after  the midterm elections. 
7035,c.j., I think I understand. 
7036,bartlet,"I needed to get Leo off the hook, C.J. "
7037,c.j.,It's the deal Josh and Sam made. 
7038,bartlet,Yes. We'll deal with it after the midterm elections. 
7039,c.j.,I understand. 
7040,bartlet, I was hoping you would. 
7041,c.j.,"Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Umm, several members of the press already know, I think, the report  came back to us and... "
7042,bartlet,"Yeah. Well there's nothing wrong with telling them we got it. I wouldn't make a big deal  out of it. We got it, we're looking at it, we're studying it. Throw it out with the trash. "
7043,c.j.,Yes sir. 
7044,bartlet,"Thanks, C.J. "
7045,c.j.,Thank you sir.   Mr. President? We could all be better teachers. 
7046,bartlet,I know. 
7047,c.j.,Hi. 
7048,c.j.,Hmm? 
7049,c.j., I was... uh.... nothing. 
7050,c.j.,Danny? 
7051,c.j.,If you call Mr. and Mrs. Lydell in St. Paul and ask them why... 
7052,c.j.,Look... 
7053,c.j.,I wasn't. 
7054,c.j.,There all stories this week. 
7055,c.j.,Four other press secretaries and you never took a free lead? 
7056,c.j.,Then... 
7057,c.j.,Why? 
7058,c.j., What makes you think I'll like you now? 
7059,c.j.,Good point. 
7060,c.j.,No you won't. 
7061,c.j., Cause we've gotten very good at this. 
7062,c.j.,"Yes, we have. "
7063,leo,Yeah? 
7064,leo,Thanks. 
7065,leo,I'm Leo McGarry. 
7066,leo,I wanted to meet you and I wanted you to meet me. 
7067,leo,"Would you like to put down your things and talk for a minute? If you don't, I understand. "
7068,leo,"When you read in my personnel file that I had been treated for alcohol and drug abuse,  what went through your mind? Karen, it's okay, you can say it. The worst thing I'm  empowered to do is fire you and I've already done that. "
7069,leo," So did mine. In fact he died from it. He came home late one night very drunk,  my mother was yelling at him. I'm not sure about what, but I heard the yelling downstairs  from my bedroom. She came upstairs and he went out to the garage and shot himself in the  head. "
7070,leo,I drank and took drugs because I'm a drug addict and an alcoholic. 
7071,leo,"I'm not cured. You don't get cured. I haven't had a drink or a pill in six and a half  years, which isn't to say I won't have one tomorrow. "
7072,leo,I don't know. But probably a nightmare the likes of which both our fathers experienced.  And me too. 
7073,leo,"The problem is, I don't want a drink, I want ten drinks. "
7074,leo, No. 
7075,leo,'Cause I'm an alcoholic. 
7076,leo,I know. It's okay. Hardly anyone does. It's very hard to understand. 
7077,leo,"You haven't answered my question yet. When you saw my personnel file, when you saw I'd  been through treatment, what when through your mind? "
7078,leo,"Karen, what you did caused a lot of problems; for me, for the President, and for a lot of  people we don't even know. But I'm not sure it wasn't a little bit brave. Did you like  working at the White House? "
7079,leo,Okay. Then why don't you go unpack your carton and you and I will give each other a second  chance? 
7080,josh,I’m out of here.
7082,josh,"I’m seeing Sam, and then I’m out of here."
7084,josh,It’s a bachelor party.
7086,josh,I can hold my liquor.
7088,josh,I can drink with the best of them.
7090,josh,"I’m in politics, okay. I can drink."
7092,josh,I wish you’d stop telling people that. It makes me sound like an idiot.
7094,josh,"And this is the first time in a long time I’ve had the opportunity to spend the weekend  doing anything but working, is my point."
7096,josh,Nah.
7098,josh,Yeah.
7100,josh,There aren’t going to be strippers there. Men don’t like that anymore.
7102,josh,"No, we still like naked women a lot. It’s looking at them in a room full of your best  friends that makes you feel a little..."
7104,josh,Uncomfortable.
7105,josh,Sam.
7106,sam,Hi.
7107,josh,I’m out of here. What do you need? 
7108,sam, What do I need?
7109,sam,Yes. I need you to do me a favor.
7110,josh,On O’Dwyer?
7111,sam,His people are calling. They want to know what’s going on.
7112,josh,Who’s his people?
7113,sam,A campaign manager. A guy named Joey Lucas.
7114,josh,Never heard of him.
7115,sam,Me neither.
7116,josh,What’s he like?
7117,sam,I didn’t speak with him. I spoke with his assistant. 
7118,josh,What’s the favor?
7119,sam,I scheduled a meeting for tomorrow with him to try to figure out what’s going on.
7120,josh,Aren’t you going sailing tomorrow?
7121,sam,Yeah.
7122,josh,"Then how are you gonna...  Oh, come on!"
7123,sam,Ten minutes.
7124,josh,On a Saturday!
7125,sam,"Well, do you have plans?"
7126,josh,I was planning on doing nothing.
7127,sam,"Ten minutes, fifteen minutes tops."
7128,josh,Sam...
7129,sam,"He’s going to be very excited to meet with you. Joshua Lyman, Deputy Chief of Staff.  He can hear it from the horse’s mouth."
7130,josh,What am I supposed to tell him?
7131,sam,On O’Dwyer?
7132,josh,Yeah.
7133,sam,Tell him the truth.
7134,josh,I don’t think so. What else you got?
7136,sam,10:00 tomorrow morning.
7138,josh,We have to be here at 10:00 tomorrow morning.
7140,josh,‘Cause you work for me.
7142,josh,What things?
7144,josh,For what?
7146,josh,Ten minutes. When it’s over I’ll buy you some shoes. 
7147,josh,I’m out of here.
7148,sam,"I’m bringing back the Cup, man."
7149,josh,"Sam, just stay in the boat this time and I’m a happy guy."
7150,sam,Okay.
7151,josh,Good luck. 
7152,sam, I’ve got foul weather gear.
7153,josh, See you later.
7154,sam,"Bonnie, I’m done?"
7155,sam,"I’m cutting the cord, Bonnie. I’m gonna be unreachable for the weekend."
7156,sam,Not taking my pager. 
7157,sam,Out on the ocean blue. Totally cut off from the White House.
7158,sam, Not taking the pager.
7159,sam,Yeah?
7160,sam,Yeah.
7161,sam,You too.
7162,sam,Sam Seaborn.
7163,sam,Is he guilty?
7164,sam,Is he guilty?
7165,sam,"Bobby, is he guilty?"
7166,sam,Bobby!
7167,sam,You want me to argue it was a public service measure? 
7168,sam,Blackmun’s in support of the death penalty.
7169,sam,Yes.
7170,sam,You don’t have to quote Harry Blackmun with me.
7171,sam,"I don’t talk to the President that way, Bobby. Nobody talks to the President that way.  And I’m gonna tell you not that many people talk to me that way anymore."
7172,sam,How long you been with the P.D.’s office?
7173,sam,I heard you were at Ross-Lipton.
7174,sam,What happened?
7175,sam,The President’s very serious about the separation of powers.
7176,sam,"Thanks for pointing that out. I’m saying the judicial branch has spoken, so why should...?"
7177,sam,The President’s not hiding behind anything. Right now the President’s on Air Force One  coming back home from Stockholm. 
7178,sam,Around 9:00 a.m.
7179,sam,"Well, I won’t be here tomorrow morning, but I’ll ask Toby Ziegler to talk..."
7180,sam,Bobby.
7181,sam,"I’ll pass it up to Toby Ziegler. He’ll ask for a few minutes of the President’s time,  but I have to be honest with you. After a long trip..."
7182,sam,"Well, it’s Saturday. I think Toby will probably be at temple first thing in the morning."
7183,sam,Bobby.
7184,sam,I don’t know the name of the temple.
7185,sam, I think it’s on Delaware.
7186,sam,Leo.
7187,leo,I thought you left.
7188,sam,I just came back to get my bag.
7189,leo,What’s going on?
7190,sam,They denied the appeal.
7191,leo,Simon Cruz.
7192,sam,Yeah.
7193,leo,I thought they were sending it back to the...
7194,sam,Me too.
7195,leo,"No, our guy said they were going to send it back to the sixth circuit."
7196,sam,Well they didn’t. The denied the appeal five-three.
7197,leo,That’s not what was supposed to happen.
7198,sam,We’ve got the get Mendoza on the Bench.
7199,leo,Come on.
7200,sam,Leo.
7201,leo,"If Mendoza was on the bench, they would have lost five-four. So what are we talking about?"
7202,sam,The execution is scheduled...
7203,leo,What? 
7204,sam,"The execution is scheduled for 12:01 Monday morning, so the ball’s in our court."
7205,leo,I’m not sure the President wants the ball in our court. 
7206,sam,"Well, that makes two of us."
7207,leo,Have a good weekend.
7208,sam,You’re not gonna...
7209,leo,He lands at 9:00 tomorrow morning. I’ll let him sleep a little bit then I’ll talk it  through with him.
7210,sam,I can brief Toby before I leave.
7211,leo,Right.
7212,sam,I’ll see you later. 
7213,leo,Sam.
7214,sam,Yeah? 
7215,leo,Why Monday morning?
7216,sam,What do you mean?
7217,leo,The court denied the appeal. Why isn’t he being executed at midnight tonight?
7218,sam,We don’t execute people between sundown Friday and sundown Sunday.
7219,leo,Why?
7220,sam,Hard as it is to believe...
7221,leo, You’re kidding me.
7222,sam,No.
7223,leo,We don’t execute people on the Sabbath.
7224,sam,No.
7225,leo,"Well, that’s about the most bizarre thing I’ve ever heard."
7226,sam,"Leo, I think you’re gonna find as you go through this weekend that there’s virtually no  part of this discussion that isn’t bizarre. I’m gonna go home now. I got to race in the  morning. "
7227,leo," Hold on to a rope or something, would you."
7228,sam,Yeah.
7229,leo,Damn it.
7232,josh,Hi.
7234,josh,What?
7236,josh,No. Just since a couple of hours ago.
7238,josh,Yup.
7240,josh,What?
7242,josh,"I couldn’t find my keys, or remember where I lived. "
7244,josh,I think there might have been strippers there. 
7247,josh,I may have wrinkled my suit.
7249,josh,Donna. You... You really want to speak very softly.
7251,josh,People were pouring champagne over each other.
7253,josh,"I can’t remember, but it’s certainly not out of the question."
7255,josh,"Yeah, I know. I’m not, you know. Uh... what was the meeting again?"
7257,josh,Yes. 
7259,josh,I’m fine.
7261,josh,I’m fine.
7263,josh,They’re the only clothes I got.
7265,josh,Fine. 
7267,josh, I’m not even listening to you now.
7269,josh,Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.
7270,bartlet,"C.J., look..."
7271,c.j.,"Don’t start with me, Mr. President."
7272,bartlet,I was helping pass the time. I was being entertaining as well as instructive.
7273,c.j.,"I’m back in America now, I have rights. I’m no longer belted down next to the passenger  from hell."
7274,leo," Welcome back, Mr. President."
7275,bartlet,Leo! What’re you doing here?
7276,leo,"I needed a minute, sir. How was the flight?"
7277,c.j.,It was --
7278,bartlet,Great!
7279,c.j.,"-- gruesome. “If you’ll look out the left side of the cabin, you’ll see the fjords.”  Then we got a history of the fjords. Then we got a quiz on the fjords.   Do you have any idea how much I would like to dress you up in lederhosen  and drop kick you into the fjords right now?"
7280,bartlet,Aww. You don’t know how to have fun when we’re traveling...
7281,leo, It ain’t over yet.
7283,josh,Huh.
7285,josh,What’s that?
7287,josh,Coffee?
7289,josh,Blah.
7291,josh,What time is this person coming?
7293,josh,I’m not wearing that.
7295,josh,He’s getting here in forty minutes.
7297,josh,Who’s Zuzu?
7299,josh,His name is Zuzu?
7301,josh,I’ll look like the Gorton’s fisherman in this thing. 
7302,sam,Sam Seaborn.
7303,toby,What do you want?
7304,sam,How ya doing?
7305,toby,"Sam, I’m at temple right now."
7306,sam,"Yeah, by any chance is your rabbi giving a sermon on capital punishment?"
7307,toby,What?
7308,sam,Is your rabbi giving a sermon on capital punishment? 
7309,toby," Yeah, he is. How did you know that?"
7310,sam,I’ll explain it to you when you get over here.
7311,toby,Why am I coming over there?
7312,sam,The appeal was denied.
7313,toby,"All right, I’m on my way."
7314,josh, What is God’s name is happening right now?
7315,josh, You’re Joey Lucas?
7316,josh,"Help me, ‘cause I... I don’t..."
7317,josh,"Ah.  Ah, okay. I’m Josh Lyman."
7318,josh,You’re Joey Lucas.
7319,josh,A man.
7320,josh,You’re O’Dwyer’s campaign manager? 
7321,josh,Me?
7322,josh," I was... I uh... I... I spilt some things on my clothes. Tell  you what, let’s... let’s just take a deep breath for a second while I try and remember,  you know, where I am right now."
7323,josh,I have a very delicate system.
7325,josh,Thank God.
7327,josh," This is my assistant, Donna Moss. Donna, Joey Lucas."
7329,josh,I’m just going to go... I... I... I’m... I’m gonna go change my clothes. I’ll... I’ll be  right back. 
7330,josh,Took you long enough.
7332,josh,You have any idea how dumb I looked in there?
7334,josh,Yes.
7336,josh,Yes.
7338,josh,Give me those. 
7340,josh,What’s Sam doing here?
7342,josh,What are you talking about?
7344,josh," Oh, man. Make sure they’re going to be okay in there. This might take a  few minutes."
7345,toby,Are you saying my rabbi wrote a sermon just for me? 
7346,sam,Yeah.
7347,toby,How did he know what was going on here?
7348,sam,"One of the public defenders, guy named Bobby Zane..."
7349,toby,One of the public defenders spoke to my rabbi?
7350,sam,Yeah.
7351,toby,How did he know where I go to temple? How did he know I even go to temple?
7352,josh, I thought they were sending it back to the sixth circuit.
7353,toby,I thought so too.
7354,josh,Where’s the President?
7355,sam,He’s in the residence.
7356,josh,Are we getting a briefing from Justice?
7357,sam,He’ll be here in a minute.
7358,josh,When’s the execution?
7359,sam,"Sunday, 12:01."
7360,sam,Minute after midnight tomorrow.
7361,josh,Lethal injection?
7362,sam,Yeah.
7363,josh,"Possibly.  Hey, why aren’t you sailing right now?"
7364,sam,I stayed.
7365,sam,Speculative evidence at best.
7366,sam,‘63 was the last execution.
7367,josh,Lincoln.
7368,josh,"No, Bert Lincoln. Mandy, what are you-?"
7369,josh,I don’t want a debate on the death penalty. Let’s get some stuff together and get ready for the President.
7370,josh,"I gotta get back to...  Oh... By the way, Sam. Joey Lucas is waiting  for me in my office right now."
7371,sam,"Well, what’s he like?"
7372,josh,"Well, for a campaign manager, he’s got very nice legs."
7373,sam,He’s a woman?
7374,josh,Yes. He is. He’s also deaf. And very pissed. Be right back. 
7375,toby, Sam.
7376,sam,You know there’s room to give the President some judicial cover if he wants to commute.
7377,toby,Sam.
7378,sam,"This guy was convicted of three murders by a Mexican court. Does that matter to us?  During the penalty phase, the trial judge let the prosecutor introduce the evidence  of the Mexican convictions."
7379,toby,I know.
7380,sam,"Well, the Mexican courts are ridiculous, Toby. That never should have..."
7381,toby,How did the public defender know I was at that temple?
7382,sam,"I’m saying, this guy didn’t have the world’s greatest legal council."
7383,toby,How did he know where I was going to be?
7384,sam,I told him.
7385,toby,You told him.
7386,sam,Yeah.
7387,toby,"Sam, what’re you doing giving out that kind of information-"
7388,sam,I know. I don’t know. Right at that moment it seemed like what I should do.
7389,toby,"He’s not going to commute the sentence, Sam."
7390,sam,We don’t know what the President’s gonna do.
7391,toby,It seemed like what you should do?
7392,sam,Yeah.
7393,toby,Okay. 
7394,leo,"So, anyway, he was tried and found guilty four years ago in the district court in  Michigan. And the sixth circuit turned down his appeal. The Supreme Court gave him  a stay, heard the case, turned him down five-three."
7395,bartlet,We got to get Mendoza on the bench.
7396,leo,"Well, that’s Monday’s problem. Your problem’s today. "
7397,bartlet,Why is it my problem at all?
7398,leo,As opposed to who?
7399,bartlet,The governor of Michigan.
7400,leo,"Oh, you mean, why isn’t it a state crime."
7401,bartlet,Yeah.
7402,leo,It was prosecuted by the U.S. Attorney under the ‘88 drug kingpin law that was modified  into the ‘94 omnibus crime bill. 
7403,bartlet,Which allows for the death penalty in certain drug related homicides.
7404,leo,"Well, basically. The deputy AG’s office is putting together a briefing for you."
7405,bartlet,How long?
7406,leo,About an hour.
7407,bartlet,"Okay, I’ll wait for that then."
7408,leo,Yeah.
7409,bartlet,I’m gonna want to see our people over the next few days.
7410,leo,Everyone’s here now or on their way.
7411,bartlet,"I’m not going to be very good at this, Leo."
7412,leo,"Well, you’ll be joining a pretty big club, Mr. President."
7413,bartlet,Yeah.  Charlie!
7414,leo,I’ll call you when the guys have put something together. 
7415,bartlet,Thank you.
7416,leo,"Thank you, Mr. President. "
7417,bartlet,"Charlie, there’s a priest in Hanover. His name is Thomas Cavanaugh. He’s at the  Immaculate Heart of Mary. I’d like to arrange to have him come down and spend some  time with me this weekend. Very important that the White House not pay for this. This  is my nickel."
7418,bartlet,And I’m gonna want to... 
7419,bartlet,"No. No, never mind.  Yeah. I’m gonna want to talk to the Pope."
7420,bartlet,Charlie.
7421,bartlet," I’m gonna ask you a question. And this is one of  those times that it’s okay to tell me I’ve stepped over the line, and I should shut  my mouth, okay. "
7422,bartlet,What happened to the guy who shot your mother?
7423,bartlet,"If they did, would you wanna see him executed? "
7424,bartlet,Killing a police officer’s a capital crime. I figured you must have thought about it.
7425,bartlet,And?
7426,bartlet, Yeah.
7427,bartlet,"Thank you, Charlie."
7428,josh,Because you have a chance to beat him.
7429,josh,We’ve been watching your campaign. You’re doing way too well.
7430,josh,He’s a preposterous figure. We want to keep him right where he is.
7431,josh,"Joey, every time he comes out with one of his declarations about brown people crossing  the border, the DNC slaps it into a direct mail campaign, and he’s good for two or  three million dollars."
7432,josh, No problem.
7433,josh,The President doesn’t take meetings on this level. I don’t even take meetings on  this level!
7434,josh,Joey. 
7435,josh,"I’m not hearing a lot of party loyalty from you here, Joey."
7436,josh,Hey!
7437,josh," Hey, Lunatic Lady! Trust me when I tell you that there’s absolutely no way  that you are going to see the President!"
7438,bartlet," Hey, Josh."
7439,josh,"Hello, Mr. President. Welcome back."
7440,bartlet,How are you?
7441,josh,"Well, I’d like this day to be over pretty bad."
7442,bartlet,Who are your friends?
7443,josh,"Uh, this is Joey Lucas."
7444,bartlet, How are you?
7445,bartlet,Thank you.
7446,josh, And this is Kenny... somebody.
7447,bartlet,"Hi, Kenny."
7448,josh,We were just finishing up.
7449,bartlet,I was just wandering the halls and thinking.
7450,josh,"Why don’t you let me show these people off and, uh, I can wander the halls with you."
7451,bartlet, You ever seen the White House?
7452,bartlet,Let’s take a walk.
7453,josh,Sir.
7454,bartlet,Come on.
7455,josh,Yes sir.
7456,c.j.,Carol. Good. I need biographical information on Simon Cruz.
7457,c.j.,I don’t know.
7458,c.j.,Gonna need to know how to spell his name for sure. 
7459,bartlet,Do you read lips?
7460,bartlet,Joey?
7461,bartlet,Is that short for Joanne?
7462,bartlet,And your last name is Lucas?
7463,bartlet,Is that Polish?
7464,bartlet,Protestant?
7465,bartlet,"Well, this is the Oval Office. Come in, please. Sit down. "
7466,bartlet,"Well, where did you go to school?"
7467,bartlet,There’s a guy named Simon Cruz on death row. He’s going to be executed in about 36  hours. What do you think I should do? 
7468,bartlet,Why?
7469,bartlet,He was found guilty of a double murder and drug trafficking.
7470,bartlet,You’re against capital punishment.
7471,bartlet,Did you study St. Augustine at Stanford?
7472,bartlet,Thomas Aquinas?
7473,bartlet,"Two pretty smart guys, right?"
7474,bartlet,"They believed in that part of the Old Testament which said, “Who sheddeth a man’s  blood by man shall his blood be shed.”"
7475,bartlet,I’ve got a Harris poll says seventy-one percent of the American people support capital  punishment.
7476,bartlet,I’m a politician.
7477,josh,"Thank you, Mr. President. We should... "
7478,bartlet,In the California forty-sixth?
7479,bartlet,O’Dwyer’s an empty shirt.
7480,bartlet,"I don’t like guys who run for congress because they think it’s a great gig. Find  yourself a live one and I’ll get interested. In the meantime, the devil you know  beats the devil you don’t. And I like the devil I got."
7481,bartlet,Josh will take care of you from here.
7482,josh, Nice to meet you.
7483,josh, You didn’t have a good time meeting me?
7484,josh,"You know what, I actually know that sign. "
7485,josh,"Don’t know that one, but I can probably guess."
7486,toby,Rabbi Glassman.
7487,toby,"Yeah, well, I had to go back to my office and I think you know why."
7488,toby,Um? 
7489,toby,That’s funny.
7490,toby,I never imagined the practicing.
7491,toby,Rabbi. You - and Bobby Zane - what were you expecting of me when you gave your sermon  yesterday?
7492,toby,"As Communications Director, uh, I’m a counselor to the President to be sure. But my  role in these situations is generally... I create a public face for what... I don’t  influence policy."
7493,toby,"You want me to go into the Oval Office and say, “Vengeance is not Jewish”?"
7494,toby,"Well, for one thing, neither is the President!"
7495,toby,"Look, I... I spent the day..."
7496,toby,You’re damn right. I did.
7497,toby,"Congratulations, Rabbi Glassman, you may now join the White House communications staff."
7498,toby,"Yeah, well, you’re welcome.  The Torah doesn’t prohibit capital punishment."
7499,toby,"It says, “An eye for an eye.”"
7500,toby,You know what I think? I think you knew I was coming back here. And I think you put her  there on purpose. 
7501,toby," Yeah. Well, anyway. "
7502,toby,"Shalom, Rabbi. "
7503,c.j.,Yeah.
7504,c.j.,Yeah.
7505,c.j.,I have his biographical information. His mother’s name is Sophia. Sophia.
7506,c.j.,I have more than that.
7507,c.j.,"You know, I have no position on capital punishment. I try to get worked up about it,  it seems like I should. But the truth is, I honestly don’t care if Simon Cruz lives  or dies. And I suppose if it brings some measure of comfort to the families of the  victims, then why the hell not."
7508,c.j.,"So, here’s my job tonight. If this thing happens.  “At 12:01, he’ll get the injection...”"
7509,c.j.,"No, I’m saying, I’m reading it, right here. “The first sign of death will be his hands  twitching. After sixty seconds, he’ll strain against the straps, his head will have  snapped back violently, and after ninety seconds he’ll be in convulsions. At 12:04,  he’ll be pronounced dead.”"
7510,c.j.,"Me neither. That’s what I’m saying, me neither. Except... at 12:04, ‘cause that’s when  the warden calls me. That’s my job tonight. I have to go in and tell the President that  Simon Cruz is dead and we’re the ones who killed him. So...   I just wish I didn’t know his mother’s name was Sophia, is all I’m saying. "
7511,bartlet,Okay.
7512,toby," Good afternoon, sir. Welcome back. "
7513,bartlet,Thank you.
7514,toby,How was your trip?
7515,bartlet,Fine. What do you need?
7516,toby,"I had a strange experience this weekend. One of the P.D.s on the Cruz case, I guess  trying the things you do when you’re desperate, he went and spoke to my rabbi."
7517,bartlet,Jewish law doesn’t prohibit...
7518,toby,I know.
7519,bartlet,"The commandment does not say, “Thou shalt not kill.” It says, “Thou shalt not murder.”"
7520,toby,"I know. But the fact is that, even two thousand years ago, the rabbis of the Talmud  couldn’t...  ...stomach it. I mean, they weren’t about  to rewrite the Torah, but they came up with another way. They came up with legal  restrictions, which make our criminal justice system look... They made it impossible  for the state... to punish someone by killing them. "
7521,bartlet,"We make it very hard to kill anybody in this country, Toby."
7522,toby,It should be impossible.
7523,bartlet,But it’s not.
7524,toby,But it should be.
7525,bartlet,Hey.
7526,leo,Hey. What’s going on?
7527,bartlet,Toby went to Shul.
7528,toby,"Yeah. Thank you, Mr. President. "
7529,leo, Japan opened huge.
7530,bartlet,Yeah.
7531,leo,Up two cents against the Yen.
7532,bartlet,"I commute this guy, for no particular reason other than I don’t like the death penalty..."
7533,leo,I know.
7534,bartlet,And the next President sees it in a different way. I’ve laid track to all kinds of...  The next guy is gonna have eighth amendment problems up the ass.
7535,leo,"Well, if that’s the only thing that’s stopping you... "
7536,bartlet,We cannot execute some people and not execute others depending on the mood of the Oval  Office. It’s cruel and unusual. 
7537,leo,"If that’s the only thing stopping you, then I’ll say this for the first time in your  Presidency... Let that be the next guy’s problem."
7538,bartlet,"Okay. Give me a minute please, Nancy. "
7539,leo,I’ll take care of it.
7540,bartlet,Thank you.
7541,sam,The U.S. is one of five countries on earth that puts to death people who’re under  the age of 18 when they committed a crime.
7542,sam,Pakistan.
7543,sam,"Yeah. So, that’s a list we definitely want to be on. "
7544,leo, Sam.
7545,sam,"Leo, I put my notes together. I..."
7546,leo,Walk with me.
7547,sam,"Actually, I was hoping to see the President."
7548,leo,"You’re not going to see the President, Sam."
7549,sam,Leo.
7550,leo,He’s done.
7551,sam,We have six hours...
7552,leo,He’s done.
7553,sam,"Leo, it’s not an impossible sell."
7554,leo,"I’ve lived longer than you, Sam..."
7555,sam,Leo.
7556,leo," He’s done, and I gotta tell you, Sam, this was bungled. We were totally  unprepared for this."
7557,sam,What the hell are you...?
7558,leo,We were caught in the headlights... This thing was supposed to go back to the sixth  circuit. And I don’t know how it happened...
7559,leo,I’d have...
7560,sam,What would you have done different? You’d have kept the President out of the country  another two days?
7561,leo, Yes.
7562,sam,"Leo, there are times when we are absolutely nowhere. "
7563,josh,Hello.  Hi.
7564,josh, Thank you for meeting me.
7565,josh,Aren’t you impressed that I was able to track you down?
7566,josh,It was very hard. I had to have my assistant call your office in California. 
7567,josh,"It’s funny, when I say it out loud like that, it doesn’t sound that impressive."
7568,josh," No, I came at the request of the President. He wanted you to know  that he felt that he was rude to you in the Oval Office yesterday. He apologizes  if he was abrupt about your problem and while the tightening of your funding was  political strategy on our part, he honestly feels that your candidate is a schmuck  who gives liberalism a bad name."
7569,josh, I know you do. Why are you working for him?
7570,josh,I’d imagine. He also wanted me to tell you that he meant what he said. Come up with  a live one and we’ll get interested in a hurry. 
7571,josh,"As a matter of fact, he did."
7572,josh, You. 
7573,josh,You guys have a nice flight back. 
7574,bartlet,Yeah.
7575,bartlet,Thank you. 
7576,bartlet,Tom.
7577,bartlet,"Thank you, Charlie. "
7578,bartlet,Thanks for coming all this way down.
7579,bartlet,"Yeah, it seems like a wasted trip."
7580,bartlet,This is it. 
7581,bartlet,You’re looking at the room.
7582,bartlet,We don’t use the red phone anymore.
7583,bartlet,I tell Mrs. Landingham I want to talk to the Kremlin. Would you like a drink?
7584,bartlet,"To be honest, I prefer Mr. President."
7585,bartlet,"You understand why, right?"
7586,bartlet,It’s not ego.
7587,bartlet,There are certain decisions I have to make while I’m in this room. Do I send troops  into harm’s way? Which fatal disease gets the most research money?
7588,bartlet,It’s helpful in those situations not to think of yourself as the man but as the office.
7589,bartlet,I want you to know that I had a number of people on my staff search for a reason the  public would find palatable to commute the sentence. A technicality. Any evidence of  racism.
7590,bartlet,Yeah.
7591,bartlet,"I’m the leader of a democracy, Tom. Seventy-one percent of the people support capital  punishment. People have spoken. The courts have spoken."
7592,bartlet,Yeah.
7593,bartlet," Oh, for crying out loud, Tom. I open my mouth and say, “Somebody get me the Pope.”"
7594,bartlet,"Anyway. I looked for a way out, I really did."
7595,bartlet,I know.
7596,bartlet,I know.
7597,bartlet,"I did, Tom. I know it’s hard to believe, but I prayed for wisdom."
7598,bartlet, It never has. And I’m a little pissed off about that. 
7599,bartlet, I’m not kidding.
7600,c.j.,Excuse me.
7601,bartlet,"Yes, please."
7602,bartlet,"Bless me, Father, for I have sinned..."
7603,josh,What’re you talking about?
7604,sam,He was arrested.
7605,josh,For what?
7606,sam,"Drunk driving, resisting arrest, and I think disorderly conduct."
7607,josh,You think?
7608,sam,"This thing’s about 30 minutes old, Josh. I don’t know exactly what happened."
7609,josh,What do we know?
7610,sam,Mendoza doesn’t drink.
7611,josh,He’s arrested for drunk driving.
7612,sam,"Roberto Mendoza doesn’t drink, Josh."
7613,josh,How much does the press know?
7614,sam,They don’t know anything.
7615,josh,The cops haven’t leaked it?
7616,sam,"I swear to God, I don’t think the cops know."
7617,josh,They don’t know that they’ve arrested Roberto Mendoza?
7618,sam,They don’t know it’s that Roberto Mendoza.
7619,josh,I’ve got this thing now.
7620,sam,I got a cab.  I’ll let you know what’s going on.
7621,josh,"Stay ahead of the pace, Sam, and have Toby page me. We don’t even know if this guy’s  called a lawyer. Is he sitting in a jail cell right now? "
7622,josh,Thank you. Thank you very much.
7623,josh,Thanks David. Good to see you.
7624,josh, Here.
7625,josh,I’ll do my best.
7626,c.j.,What happened?
7627,sam,"It’s not as bad as you think, C.J."
7628,c.j.,Was the President’s nominee for the Supreme Court just arrested for drunk driving?
7629,sam,Yes.
7630,c.j.,"Then it’s pretty bad, isn’t it?"
7631,sam,Sure.
7632,c.j.,I thought he doesn’t drink.
7633,sam,He doesn’t drink.
7634,c.j.,He was tonight.
7635,sam,"C.J., we’ve vetted the man. I’m not saying he’s not a heavy drinker, I’m saying he  doesn’t drink."
7636,c.j.,Then what was he pulled over for?
7637,sam,Driving while being...Hispanic.
7638,c.j.,Does Toby know?
7639,toby, I stepped off the edge of the world.
7640,sam, Yes.
7641,toby,Where’d this happen?
7642,sam,"Wesley, Connecticut."
7643,c.j.,Why’d he refuse the Breathalyzer?
7644,toby,‘Cause he’s a crazy man who’s out to ruin my life. 
7645,sam,Toby?
7646,toby,That’s what he’s out to do. Has anyone posted bail? 
7647,sam,No.
7648,toby,Why not?
7649,sam,They can’t find a judge.
7650,toby,Why not?
7651,c.j.,"It’s not Cook County, Toby. It’s Friday night in Wesley, Connecticut."
7652,toby,"Believe me when I tell you this, C.J. I will figure out a way to blame this on you."
7653,c.j.,I have no doubt about that.
7654,leo,"Have someone find his lawyer and talk to him. Sam, there’s an Air Force Lear jet with  its motor running. Fly to Westchester County airport, rent a car, drive to Wesley, and  get the next associate Justice of the Supreme Court out of jail. C.J., Sam sees one  reporter when he gets off that plane, I’m gonna blame you."
7655,c.j.,Toby’s got you covered there.
7656,toby,I’m going with Sam.
7657,leo,Toby.
7658,toby,The judge and I are gonna have an abrupt conversation. 
7659,leo,I want my phone to ring once every 15 minutes. I want to know what’s going on!
7660,josh,"Well, the first thing I’ll tell you is, there’s no such thing. "
7661,josh,"I-I’ll give you an example from this week. In fact, the story I’m about to tell you  all happened within the last 36 hours. Anyone who’s been reading the papers in the  last few days has probably been following along with what we call the news cycle  that wouldn’t end. Depending on how you look at it, it started either with a cabinet  secretary losing her temper, a committee chairman baiting her during a hearing, the  President answering a question he shouldn’t have, a dentist appointment, or me being  stupid.  One thing’s for sure, it  started out as a day that was supposed to trumpet the President’s vision for  educational reform."
7662,sam,Give me the bullet points.
7663,c.j.,I understand this stuff.
7664,sam,Excellent.
7665,c.j.,I really do.
7666,sam,I have complete confidence in you.
7667,c.j.,Thank you.
7668,toby,Give him the bullet points.
7669,c.j.,"I feel bathed in your confidence as well, Toby."
7670,c.j.,Forgive student loans to people who become teachers --
7671,toby,And?
7672,c.j.,"-- and spend at least three years teaching in a rural or inner-city school. Give cash  bonuses to people who leave other careers to become teachers and provide federal money  for grants to individual school districts to use older, more experienced teachers to  train younger, less experienced teachers."
7673,toby,Should note that half of all new teachers quit in the first three years.
7674,c.j.,"It’s right here on my index card, Toby. "
7675,toby,"Very good, then."
7676,josh, Toby.
7677,toby,Yeah.
7678,josh,Got a minute?
7679,toby,Yeah.
7680,c.j.,Thank you both.
7681,sam,"Hey, you know what? "
7682,c.j.,What?
7683,sam,What time is your briefing?
7684,c.j.,Eleven o’clock.
7685,sam,We should push it to one o’clock.
7686,c.j.,I thought about that.
7687,sam,Do it after the bill signing. Let this be the story. Let’s control the news cycle.
7688,c.j.,"Carol, let’s move the briefing to one."
7689,c.j.,Why not?
7690,c.j.,"Yes, and this is a perfect excuse to postpone the thing."
7691,sam,You have a thing?
7692,c.j.,I have a dentist appointment at noon.
7693,sam,What’s wrong?
7694,c.j.,Nothing’s wrong.
7695,c.j.,I’m experiencing some pain.
7696,sam,For how long?
7697,c.j.,"About a month now, but it’ll go away by itself."
7698,sam,When?
7699,c.j.,"When I die, Sam. "
7700,sam,"Carol, set the briefing for two o’clock. Keep the appointment."
7701,c.j.,Sam!
7702,sam,"Your teeth are the best friends you got, C.J."
7703,c.j.,They are?
7704,sam,"You take care of them, they’ll take care of you."
7705,c.j.,When’d you start talking like this?
7706,sam,I’m nuts for dental hygiene.
7707,c.j.,Go away. Now.
7708,sam,Okay. 
7709,toby,She called him a racist?
7710,josh,She didn’t use that word.
7711,toby,What word did she use?
7712,josh,"Well, yes, she used that word."
7713,toby,Bonnie. Ginger.
7714,toby,I want anything that might be on the wire already about the HUD Secretary calling Jack  Wooden a racist.
7715,toby,"No, Bonnie, I want it at whatever leisurely pace you two feel..."
7716,toby,"I want it now.  On C-SPAN, she called him a racist?"
7717,josh,"Nah, not just Wooden. She was pretty careful to include all Republicans. "
7718,toby,Why are you good humored about this?
7719,josh,She was baited.
7720,toby,Don’t care.
7721,josh,She was baited and she was right.
7722,toby,Good for her.
7723,toby,Is that a wire story?
7724,josh,What’s it say?
7725,toby, No!
7726,toby,"“Of course not,” she answered wisely?"
7727,toby,"Well, wasn’t that clever of her? "
7728,josh,"Donald Morales, who is the spokesman for the Department of Housing and Urban Development,  and who was wishing he hadn’t gotten out of bed that morning, confirms what happened.  Now there’s the matter of telling the President."
7729,bartlet,“If the shoe fits!”
7730,toby,"Gets a little bit worse, actually."
7731,bartlet," “When reporters confronted Secretary O’Leary in a hallway outside the hearing  room, she defended...” Oh come on!"
7732,leo,Don’t worry about it.
7733,bartlet,Leo!
7734,leo,I’ll take care of it.  She on her way here?
7735,josh,She’ll be here in half an hour.
7736,bartlet,Yeah.  “If the shoe fits.” Is that the best she could do? 
7737,leo,"Of her many transgressions, Mr. President, let’s not worry about she resorted to cliché."
7738,josh,"The President spoke briefly.  But, he spoke. He signed the bill. He gave away the pens. Then he took  a few questions from the press. Now, before I go on, it should be pointed out that  according to every poll conducted in the universe, the issue that concerns Americans  more than any other is education. Now, The President has just signed off on $700,000,000  in new money for education and announced a plan of aggressive education initiative.  What do you suppose the first question from the press was?"
7739,bartlet,"Let me say that I have great confidence in Deborah O’Leary. She’s done a terrific job  at HUD, helping thousands of people make the very difficult transition from joblessness  and homelessness to more fulfilling and productive lives."
7740,bartlet,"I was hoping you weren’t going to notice that, Danny."
7741,bartlet,"Then I will tell you that I agree the Republican Party does not have a comprehensive  program for combating poverty in this country. That being said, there are countless  Republicans who are working very hard to change their party’s legacy on some of these  issues. And I hope to be working with them to do just that."
7742,josh,"If only we’d stopped it right there. If only we’d said, uh, “Sorry, The President  can’t take any questions right now,” or, uh, “We’ll cover this in a briefing,” or,  “The building is on fire!”  But for some reason, it took us all a  moment to realize that there was no Press Secretary in the room."
7743,bartlet,"Frankly, I think she went too far in assigning motive to Congressman Wooden and the  Republican Party."
7744,bartlet,She’ll be meeting with Leo McGarry.
7745,bartlet,An apology’d be appropriate.
7746,leo,"Oh, get him off."
7747,josh, Sam!
7748,sam," Folks, all this is gonna be covered in the two  o’clock briefing. The President’s late for lunch with the U.N. ambassador. I’m sorry."
7749,bartlet, That went pretty well.
7750,leo,We’ll fix it.
7751,toby,Sam.
7752,sam,Yeah?
7753,toby,The U.N. ambassador is in Portugal.
7754,sam,Okay. My bad.
7755,josh,Eight words. “The President’s not taking any questions right now.” If we’d just stepped  in 30 seconds sooner. 
7756,josh,Yeah.
7757,toby,"Yeah, it’s me."
7758,josh,Are you there yet?
7759,toby,We’re lost.
7760,josh,You’re lost?
7761,sam,We’re not lost.
7762,toby,You’re from Connecticut. What exit do we want for Wesley?
7763,josh,What?
7764,toby,We missed the exit.
7765,sam,We didn’t miss the exit.
7766,josh,"Toby, I’m kind of in the middle of something here."
7767,toby,Just tell me.
7768,josh,You bet buddy.
7769,josh,Call me when you know something.   Sorry about that.
7770,josh,"The, uh, trade deficit. Where was I?"
7771,josh,The day would’ve gone a lot differently. The President had said that Secretary O’Leary  should apologize. The press wanted to know if she would be fired if she didn’t and we  didn’t have an answer. She was coming up to the White House for a showdown. This was  what the day was about now. And the day was about to get worse...because I was about  to step to the plate. 
7772,toby,We’re going the wrong way.
7773,sam,"No, we’re not."
7774,toby,We’re supposed to be going east.
7775,sam,We’re going east.
7776,toby,How do you know we’re going east?
7777,sam,The sun rises in the east.
7778,toby,It’s dark outside!
7779,sam,"Also, that bright star in the northern sky is Polaris. "
7780,toby,So what?
7781,sam,I’m using celestial navigation.
7782,toby,"Hey, Galileo, get off at the next exit and turn the car around."
7783,josh,"Secretary O’Leary was told that Leo McGarry wanted to see her as soon as possible.  There was no question that she was going to be angry about the President publicly  asking her to apologize, but at the moment, that was Leo’s problem."
7784,leo,Debbie.
7785,leo,You’re pissed at us?
7786,leo,"We blew the press today, we’ll come to that. But Debbie, I’ve got videotape of your side  of the story."
7787,leo,Maybe so...
7788,leo,Debbie.
7789,leo,Look...
7790,leo,His narrow-minded constituents are also our narrow-minded constituents.
7791,leo,"When angels dance on pinheads, Debbie. We need their votes on any number of issues,  including, by the way, the budget for the department of Housing and Urban Development."
7792,leo, Thanks. Having been born yesterday on a turnip truck...
7793,leo,"I think, Debbie, your role first and foremost is to serve the President--a task today at  which you failed spectacularly. "
7794,leo,You’re gonna apologize.
7795,leo,"Not to me, Debbie."
7796,leo,"Well, now you’re gonna apologize for it."
7797,leo,You can.
7798,leo, You will.
7799,leo,"You’re doing great work, Deb. The President’s nuts about you, always has been. He’ll cry  for three minutes after he fires your ass and then he’ll say “What’s next?”"
7800,leo,It’s the cost of doing business.
7801,leo,"Deb, he’s been trying to provoke you for months. When you give in to him, you surrender  the high ground."
7802,leo,You forgot what your grandfather taught you.
7803,leo,“Never argue with a drunk or a fool.”
7804,leo,Mostly he’s upset that you couldn’t come up with anything better than “if the shoe fits.”   Good luck. 
7805,josh,"So that should’ve been it, right? C.J. Cregg does the two o’clock briefing, tells them  Secretary O’Leary has an apology for Congressman Wooden. All questions on the matter will  be handled by her spokesperson, Donald Morales, and redirects their attention to the 700  million bucks of yours that we just spent on teachers.   Who here has had emergency root canal? "
7806,josh,Yeah.
7807,c.j., Josh.
7808,josh,What the hell happened?
7809,c.j.,I had woot canaw.
7810,josh,What happened to your cheeks?

7815,c.j.,I can suggest some othew things you can do wiff yourseff.
7816,josh,Are you in pain?
7817,josh,"You’re gonna need to stop saying that, ‘cause you just look and sound so ridiculous. "
7818,c.j.,I have to cancew the bwiefing.
7819,josh,You can’t cancel the briefing.
7820,c.j.,Wook at me.
7821,josh,You’ll be great.
7822,c.j.,I can’t do the bwiefing.
7823,josh,Why not?
7824,c.j.,I can’t even say “bwiefing.”
7825,josh,"You can’t cancel the briefing, C.J. You got to wrap up O’Leary, you got to move them back  to the bill signing."
7826,c.j.,Yoshua!
7827,josh,"Sorry, did... did you just say my name?"
7828,c.j.,You weally think I can do it?
7829,josh,"Don’t be insane, C.J. You’re not going to a press briefing looking like Bullwinkle."
7830,c.j.,"Oh, so once again you’we just hawing a wittle fun! "
7831,josh,Yeah.
7832,c.j.,Ha ha ha ha ha. 
7833,josh,When can you take the cotton out?

7843,c.j.,Wet Sam do it.
7844,josh,Sam went to Foggy Bottom.
7845,c.j.,What’s he doing in Fwoggy Bowtew?
7846,josh, I just wanted to see if I could make you say “Foggy Bottom.” Sam’s working with  the speechwriters.
7847,c.j.,Toby?
7848,josh,Toby’s with Leo and the President.
7849,c.j.,Josh...
7850,josh, Hey there cats and kittens. This is Josh Lyman  coming at you with your two o’clock briefing!
7851,c.j.,"Josh, pwease be vewy cawefuw. Twy vewy, vewy hawd not to destwoy us."
7852,josh,"You shouldn’t say that C.J., you’ve got a great body... Here we go. Woo!"
7853,josh,"Hey, Danny."
7854,josh,Do the briefing?
7855,josh,I talk to reporters all the time.
7856,josh,"Let me tell you something, mi compadre. You guys have been coddled. I’m not your  girlfriend, I’m not your camp counselor, and I’m not you sixth grade teacher you  had a crush on. I’m a graduate of Harvard and Yale and I believe that my powers of  debate can rise to meet the Socratic wonder that is the White House Press Corps.  "
7857,josh,"I’d like to say a couple things in my own defense. First of all, everything was fine.  I dispensed of the Deborah O’Leary matter with ease and poise. I opened the room up to  questions while imposing a discipline I felt had been lacking in C.J.’s briefings."
7858,josh,I’m gonna take one question a piece.
7859,josh,Mike.
7860,josh,"Mike, you sure you want your one question to be that stupid?"
7861,c.j.,Oh my God.
7862,josh,The President quit smoking years ago.
7863,c.j.,Oh my God.
7864,josh,"Well, then, uh... Jonathan."
7865,josh,I’ll look into it. Danny?
7866,josh,Let me emphasize the President is pleased that unemployment has dropped another point five  percent as a result...
7867,josh,"The President will do everything in his power to maintain the robust economy that has  created millions of new jobs, improved productivity and kept a lid on inflation."
7868,josh,"Twenty-four PhD’s and a Counsel of Economy Advisors, Katie. They have a plan to fight  inflation."
7869,josh," Yeah, Danny. We have a secret inflation plan."
7870,c.j., Oh my God!
7871,josh,I guess that’s pretty much when the wheels came off the wagon.
7872,josh,Thanks. 
7873,toby,Yeah.
7874,josh,What’s going on?
7875,toby,Sam feels we’re zeroing in on it.
7876,josh,You haven’t found it yet?
7877,toby,"We’ve been navigating by the North Star, which turned out to be the Delta shuttle from  LaGuardia. It’s a miracle we’re not in Nantucket right now. "
7878,josh,"Toby, how hard can it be to find the Wesley police station?"
7879,toby,"I don’t know, Josh, but while we’re looking, can you tell me a little more about the  President’s secret plan to fight inflation?"
7880,josh,How long until you let up on me on that?
7881,toby,"Oh, it’s gonna take a little while I would think."
7882,josh,Call me when you know something. 
7883,sam,There’s a store open up there. I’m gonna pull over and ask ‘em if they know where the  Wesley police station is.
7884,toby,"Or you could just pull in there,  at the Wesley police station and ask them."
7885,sam,Hey!
7886,toby,Yeah.
7887,sam,Look!
7888,toby,Yeah.
7889,sam,We found it!
7890,toby,Let’s get this done and get outta here.
7891,sam,Good evening.
7892,sam, My name is Sam Seaborn. I work for the President of the United States.  Is your watch commander around? 
7893,sam,No.
7894,sam," Officer Peter, we’re in a certain amount of trouble tonight  and the only thing I’ve got going for me is that you’re in more trouble than we are.  My name is Sam Seaborn, I work for the President and the sooner you reach the conclusion  that I’m telling you the truth the better off we’re all gonna be. Why don’t you go get  your watch commander?"
7895,sam,"Let me tell you something. If we’d stayed on the Merritt parkway instead of getting  of at exit 29 and going east to Greenwich, I don’t think we’d wound up in Bridgeport  so many times."
7896,toby,Shut up.
7897,sam,"Sergeant, I’m Sam Seaborn. I’m the Deputy White House Communications Director. That’s my  boss, Toby Ziegler. "
7898,sam,I know how you feel. You have Roberto Mendoza locked up back there.
7899,sam,My business is to tell you to unlock the cell and give me Mendoza.
7900,sam,"Sergeant, you’ve arrested a federal judge who’s the President’s nominee for the U.S.  Supreme Court. "
7901,josh,"Danny Concannon had thrown me a knuckle ball in the dirt, which I’d taken a big swing at  and - just like that - the President had a secret plan to fight inflation."
7902,josh,There is no secret plan!
7903,josh, I was talking to Danny. I was kidding! 
7904,josh, I honestly can’t remember the question.
7906,josh,I can fix this.
7908,josh,I can fix this.
7910,josh," This’d be a great time to feel a little support from you, Donna!"
7912,josh,Do I?
7914,josh,"Okay, good, that’s a start. Tell me what you think I should do right now."
7916,josh, That’s support?!
7917,c.j., Joshua!
7918,josh,"Yeah, that’s the face I wanted to see right now."
7919,c.j.,What the heww happened in thewe?
7920,c.j.,You compwetewy impwoded!
7921,josh,What’d I do?
7923,josh,I wouldn’t say completely.
7924,c.j.,"You wewe vague, you wewe howstiwe, you wewe bewwigewant!"
7926,c.j.,You know what it’s gonna take fow me to fix this? 
7927,josh,I’m gonna fix this.
7928,c.j.,"No, you’we not. You awe not evew awwowed in my pwess woom again!"
7929,josh,"Donna, call up Toby’s office and see if he was watching."
7930,toby, Where the hell is he?
7931,josh,Never mind.  Support me on this.
7932,c.j.,No.
7933,josh,Thanks.  Toby...
7934,toby,Have you fallen on your head?
7935,josh,Listen...
7936,toby,Have you fallen down and hit your head on something hard?
7937,josh,I feel really bad about this.
7938,toby,You do?
7939,josh,Yes.
7940,toby," Oh, well then I guess that’s all that really matters."
7941,josh,Hey!
7942,toby,"That was some very good television, Josh, and I think four network news directors will  bear me out on that tonight. "
7943,josh,I really think this isn’t as bad as you’re making it out to be.
7944,c.j.,A secwet pwan to fight infwation!
7945,toby,"Okay, C.J., for a little while you’re gonna have to write it down."
7946,sam, We have a problem.
7947,toby,No kidding!
7948,sam,Not Josh.
7949,josh,Praise God.
7950,sam,"Although I’ve gotta say, telling a reporter his question’s stupid’s not like a page out  of Dale Carnegie or anything."
7951,josh,Thank you.
7952,toby,What’s the problem?
7953,sam,You’re not gonna like it.
7954,toby,"Believe me, Sam, the only thing that could make my day worse is if Roberto Mendoza got  involved."
7955,josh,"Roberto Mendoza is the President’s nominee to fill Crouch’s seat on the Supreme Court.  The President put Toby Ziegler in charge of his confirmation, which is a huge  responsibility. A failed confirmation for the Court is a body blow to a presidency.  Besides which, he’s a brilliant jurist and we badly want him on the bench. The  confirmation process is a tough needle to thread. You gotta make a lot of friends and  Supreme Court nominees don’t speak before their confirmation, they let the White House  speak for them. Something Toby’s had a little bit of trouble teaching Roberto Mendoza."
7956,leo,He said the President was wrong?
7957,c.j.,He said the Pwesident was wong to make Secwetawy O’Weawy apowogize-
7958,leo,What the hell is...?
7959,toby,"C.J. Sam, tell him."
7960,sam,He said the President was wrong to make Secretary O’Leary apologize.
7961,leo,To who?
7962,sam,To Wooden.
7963,leo,"I’m saying, to whom did he say it to?"
7964,toby,Chicago Tribune.
7965,leo,I thought he’s on vacation?
7966,sam,He is.
7967,leo,I thought he’s on vacation in Nova Scotia?
7968,sam,He is.
7969,leo,"What, they called him in Nova Scotia?"
7970,sam,Yeah.
7971,leo,How the hell did they find him in Nova Scotia?
7972,josh,"They have telephones in Nova Scotia, Leo. It’s not Amish country."
7973,leo," I really think of all the people in this building, Josh, you want to  be the last person to speak right now."
7974,josh,You bet.
7975,c.j.,The Pwesident needs to be bwiefed on the events of the day.
7976,toby,"C.J., so help me if you use the words “Pwesident” or “bwiefed” again."
7977,leo,All right. The President lands in New Orleans in an hour and a half. There’ll be no  press at the Labor Conference. And when he’s done he’s getting right back on the plane  and coming home. Wheels down is 3:00 a.m. He’ll be back in the residence by 3:30.  
7978,josh,Can I say something?
7979,leo, What?!
7980,josh,A lot of this is our fault. And the President probably isn’t going to take this very well  and we just want you to know that we will be there with you in spirit tomorrow morning.
7981,leo,"You’re gonna be there with me in every way imaginable, Josh."
7982,josh,You bet.
7983,josh,"If you read the papers, you know that this not the first time this had happened. In  the eight weeks since the President named his nominee, Judge Mendoza has, on various  occasions, publicly criticized the American Bar Association, the AFL-CIO, and the New  York state legislature. Three organizations without which this President would not  have been elected. Putting out the Deborah O’Leary fire from earlier in the day had  been the only thing we’d been successful at, and now Judge Mendoza had... "
7984,sam,Josh.
7985,josh,Yeah.
7986,sam,We’re in.
7987,josh,Where is he?
7988,sam,Toby’s talking to him now.
7989,toby,Hello Mr. Justice. How are you?
7990,toby,No. Judge and I are gonna have a chat. 
7991,josh,"The hardest job in the White House is President. The second hardest job is not Chief  of Staff, it’s not National Security Advisor, and it’s not Press Secretary, although  I’m gaining a certain amount of respect for Press Secretaries. The second hardest job  in the White House belongs to a 21 year old kid named Charlie Young. He’s what’s called  the President’s body man, his personal aide. He’s with the President morning to night.  He has a range of responsibilities, all of them difficult. But the one he hates most in  this from time to time it is his job to wake the President up in the morning. And on  this particular morning, the President had gone to sleep only three hours earlier."
7992,bartlet,What?
7993,bartlet,What could you possibly want right now?
7994,bartlet,In the morning?
7995,bartlet,"I mean, what in the name of everything holy could you want right now?"
7996,bartlet,Who the hell is this?
7997,bartlet,And what could you possibly want?
7998,bartlet,All right.
7999,bartlet,I’ll get up now. 
8000,josh,"Mendoza was summoned to the White House from his vacation in Nova Scotia. When you  summon someone to the White House, you generally expect to see them within the hour.  Judge Mendoza told us that he would see us in three days. Why three days? Because he  was driving down to D.C., stopping in Connecticut to do some antiquing. Yet another  thing we’d have to tell the President. Who, by the way, had still not woken up."
8001,bartlet," Charlie, are you aware you’re committing  a federal crime right now?"
8002,bartlet,"How did you know the First Lady wasn’t going to be naked when you came in here?   Come to think of it, where the hell is my wife?"
8003,bartlet,That’s right.
8004,bartlet, Have you slept yet?
8005,bartlet,Good.
8006,josh, How’s your mouth?
8007,c.j.,"Well, the swelling’s gone down. On the other hand, the painkillers have worn off."
8008,leo,He’s driving from Nova Scotia to Washington?
8009,sam,Yeah.
8010,leo,How’s a person do that?
8011,sam,"Oh, my guess is, he’ll take the Trans-Canada Highway to New Brunswick, then maybe catch  the 1 and take the scenic route along the coast of Maine. 95 through New Hampshire to  the Mass Pike, and then cut over to the Merritt Parkway round Milford."
8012,toby,"Something really kinda freakish about you, you know that?"
8013,bartlet,"I’m tired, I’m cranky, and my wife’s in Argentina. Let’s get this over with."
8014,bartlet,What?
8015,leo,"Mr. President, we experienced a few public relations, what’s the word...?"
8016,toby,Catastrophes?
8017,leo,...incidents in the few hours you were away last night. 
8018,bartlet,What kind of incidents?
8019,leo,Josh.
8020,josh,"Yeah?  Oh. First, I’m happy to tell you that the incident involving Secretary  O’Leary and Congressman Wooden has been dispensed with. Though not really, and I’ll get  to that at the end. Sam asked C.J. to move the briefing to two o’clock so that we could  fold in the teachers. C.J. had emergency root canal surgery at noon and so was unable  to brief."
8021,bartlet,Who did?
8022,josh,I did.
8023,bartlet,Oh God.
8024,josh,"Yeah. A long story short, you’re gonna be reading a bit today about your secret plan  to fight inflation."
8025,bartlet,I have a secret plan to fight inflation?
8026,josh,No.
8027,bartlet,Why am I gonna be reading that I do?
8028,josh,It was suggested in the Press Room that you did.
8029,bartlet,By who?
8030,josh,By me.
8031,bartlet,You told the press I have a secret plan to fight inflation?
8032,josh,"No, I did not. Let me be absolutely clear, I did not do that. Except, yes, I did that."
8033,bartlet,"Josh, I’m a little confused."
8034,josh,"Sir, there was this idiotic round robin. It was sarcastic. There’s no way they didn’t  know that. They were just mad at me for imposing discipline and calling them stupid!"
8035,bartlet,"Okay, before we go on. C.J., if blood is gushing from the head wound you just received  from a stampeding herd of bison, you’ll do the press briefing."
8036,c.j.,Yes sir.
8037,josh,Mr. President...
8038,bartlet,A secret plan to fight inflation?
8039,josh,There was no turning them back. I denied it for half an hour. They wouldn’t take no  for an answer.
8040,bartlet,Were you clear?
8041,josh,"I was crystal clear. They said, “Do you think if the President has a plan to fight  inflation, it’s right that be keep it a secret?” I said, “Of course not!”"
8042,bartlet,"Are you telling me that not only did you invent a secret plan to fight inflation, but  now you don’t support it?"
8043,josh, When you put it like that...
8044,toby,"Mr. President, much as we’d love nothing more than to stand here and watch you beat  the living crap outta Josh, there’s actually a bigger fish to fry."
8045,bartlet,What did Mendoza do?
8046,toby,He told the Chicago Tribune that you were wrong to admonish Secretary O’Leary and  make her apologize.
8047,bartlet,"I didn’t, he did. "
8048,leo,You told me to.
8049,bartlet,You said you were gonna fix it.
8050,leo,I did fix it.
8051,bartlet,"It’s broken again, Leo."
8052,toby,"Frankly sir, that’s ‘cause your nominee for the Supreme Court’s handling himself in a  manner that’s totally unprofessional."
8053,bartlet,"We will have the first of what I think will a series of discussions about professionalism  another time, Toby. Where is Mendoza?"
8054,sam,"He’s on his way, sir."
8055,bartlet,Right now?
8056,sam,"Yes, but he won’t be here until the day after tomorrow."
8057,bartlet,Day after tomorrow?
8058,sam,Yes sir.
8059,bartlet,Is he coming in from Neptune?
8060,sam,"He’s vacationing with his wife and son, and they’d prefer to take a leisurely drive  through eastern Canada and New England while stopping for some antique shopping in  Connecticut. I imagine he’ll take the Trans-Canada Highway, the 95..."
8061,toby,Sam.
8062,bartlet,"Okay. We will wait for Mendoza. In the meantime, C.J., you will untangle the Press Corps."
8063,c.j.,Yes sir.
8064,bartlet,And we will hope that nothing happens today to make this any worse. Although I certainly  wouldn’t bet the house on it. That is all.
8065,leo,"Thank you, Mr. President."
8066,josh,"Sir, I wanna tell you that I’m sorry and that this mess will be cleaned up in an adult  and professional manner."
8067,bartlet,Good.
8068,josh," If anyone asks you, you quit smoking years ago, and the cigarette you bummed  on Air Force One was for a friend."
8069,bartlet,Get out.
8070,josh,You bet.
8071,josh,And that was it.
8072,josh,I’m sorry?
8073,josh,"Actually, he’s on his way right now. He’s spending the night in Connecticut to do some  antiquing."
8074,sam,Yeah.
8075,sam,"Well, you have a problem there."
8076,sam,"Judge Mendoza has chronic persistent hepatitis, which is a non-progressive form of  liver inflammation. If he’d had enough to drink to blow point one on the blood-alcohol,  he’d be dead right now.  This is good coffee."
8077,toby,Why didn’t you take a Breathalyzer?
8078,toby,Judge...
8079,toby,So you give Barney Fife a hard time to make a point. 
8080,toby,Not now.
8081,toby,"One phone call, Judge. “Toby, this has happened. Tell ‘em my name’s Roberto Mendoza  and the President’s named me to the bench!”"
8082,toby,Let’s go. 
8083,toby,Home. Let’s go home!
8084,toby,Judge.
8085,toby,Not anymore. Let’s go.
8086,toby,"Judge, due respect. Get your things and let’s go. "
8087,toby,He’s also seen you wearing a robe with a gavel in your hand.
8088,toby,"Robbie and Laura, where are they right now?"
8089,toby,"There’s nothing about this that doesn’t stink. If it were me, I’d wanna extract  vengeance, and I’d say “Let justice be done.” I’d also wanna spend some time in a  dark room alone, so that I didn’t have to face my wife and my son and have them see  my humiliation. Rob, I can’t get this done if this is the story. Can’t get it done.  Nothing about this that doesn’t stink. And nothing about it that wouldn’t be better  if you were a Supreme Court Justice. Let me take you to the motel. Go see your boy."
8090,sam,Yeah.
8091,sam,"Good evening, Mr. Justice."
8092,toby, You got personal items?
8093,toby,"Your lucky night, officers. There isn’t gonna be a report, there isn’t going to be  an investigation, no one’s getting suspended. And no one’s filing a hundred million  dollar lawsuit against the county that they would almost surely win. But in this room,  you’re gonna apologize to Mr. Mendoza. And then you’re gonna get in your squad car and  you’re gonna follow us and you’re gonna apologize to his son."
8094,toby,Let’s go.
8095,sam,"I also gotta say, you guys could do a better job of marking the exits on the throughway."
8096,toby,Let’s go!
8097,toby, What’s up here?
8098,toby,"Killing me, Judge. You’re absolutely killing me."
8099,sam,Josh.
8100,josh,Yeah.
8101,sam,It’s over.
8102,josh,Good.   That’s the last time the phone will ring. I promise.
8103,josh,"There’s a part of the story I didn’t tell you. I can’t. Trust me, it doesn’t involve...  I-I-I just can’t right now. Ask me back again after the Senate confirms Mendoza.  You really should hear it, it’s a good story."
8104,josh,Yeah.
8105,bartlet,I don't like putting him in this position.
8106,leo,I know.
8107,bartlet,I just don't want you to think that I'm getting any pleasure in putting him in this  position.
8108,leo,"Well, he knew the vote was going to be tight."
8109,bartlet,It's ironic.
8110,leo,Yeah.
8111,bartlet,I mean it's ironic that it all comes down to a vote on the ethanol tax credit.
8112,leo,Yeah.
8113,bartlet,50-50 tie.
8114,leo,I understand the irony.
8115,bartlet,Are you being brusque with me?
8116,leo,It's 3 o'clock in the morning.
8117,bartlet,I'm just saying you can't blame me. It's what you get from having an even number  of senators.
8118,leo,"Yeah, you should blame the constitution."
8119,bartlet,That's what I usually do.
8120,leo,Yep.
8121,bartlet," Ron, am I going to meet her on the plane?"
8122,bartlet, Zoey got a new agent on her detail.
8123,leo,I heard.
8124,bartlet,Have you seen these new agents?
8125,leo,I've seen them.
8126,bartlet,"They've got the hair, the backpacks, the clothes. Walking around campus strapped to a  44 magnum."
8127,leo,"They really blend in, huh?"
8128,bartlet,"Let me tell you something, when it's your kid, you don't want them blending in. You  want them wearing a sign that says, ""I'm carrying a loaded gun, and the safety's off."""
8129,leo, Can I say this one last time?
8130,bartlet,No.
8131,leo,If you get tired--
8132,bartlet,Leo.
8133,leo,Stay at the hotel for the night.
8134,bartlet,I won't get tired.
8135,leo,"You're not going to sleep on the plane, you're going to be running around all day,  and then you've got the fundraiser to do at night."
8136,bartlet,I want to come home after the fundraiser.
8137,leo,"That's a full day and night. Round trip, D.C. to L.A. in 24 hours. It's really no  good for you."
8138,bartlet,It'll be fine.
8139,leo, Be that way.
8140,bartlet,"Your impersonation of my mother is getting sharper and sharper, you know that?"
8141,leo,Thank you.
8142,leo,"Have a good flight, Mr. President."
8143,bartlet,I'll see you tomorrow. 
8144,bartlet,C.J.! Charlie! My flying companions!
8145,c.j.,"Good morning, Mr. President."
8146,bartlet,Is everybody on board?
8147,c.j.,"Yes, sir."
8148,bartlet,Press in a good mood?
8149,c.j.,"No, Mr. President, I wouldn't say they were."
8150,bartlet,Why not?
8151,c.j.,"Well, they're not wild about taking off at 3 0'clock in the morning, sir."
8152,bartlet,"Oh, it's going to be great. We're going to race the sun to the pacific horizon!"
8153,c.j.,"I'll be sure to tell them that, sir. I'm sure it'll pick them right up."
8154,bartlet,"Morning, Everyone. Sam, it's going to be 50-50 on the ethanol tax credit."
8155,sam,I can still make a couple of calls.
8156,bartlet,"Make all the calls you want, it's going to be 50-50."
8157,toby,"Sir, Josh and I would at least like the opportunity to talk about the Al Kiefer  meeting."
8158,bartlet,You two are so freaked out about this Al Kiefer meeting.
8159,josh,Sir.
8160,bartlet,"We'll listen to him, Josh."
8161,josh,"Yes, sir."
8162,bartlet,"You two want to see the best part about having my job?   Colonel, this is the president. I'm ready to go."
8165,c.j.,Have you tried the Lancome high-protection sunstick for face and lips?
8167,c.j.,Plus the Elizabeth Arden modern skin care daily moisturizer.
8168,toby,The two of you understand that we're going to be in California for one day?
8169,c.j.,There's tanning time between 2 and 4.
8171,c.j.,Me too.
8172,josh,Cameron’s going to introduce a bill tomorrow.
8173,sam, Gays in the military?
8174,josh,Yup.
8175,c.j.,It's Cameron. Who cares?
8176,josh,I have a feeling Ted Marcus might care.
8177,sam,He's not going to know.
8178,josh,He might.
8179,toby,"You've been in the air all night, you don't know anything, you'll get back to him."
8180,josh,Yeah.
8181,c.j.,"Plus, it's Cameron. So, who cares?"
8182,josh,Marcus is going to care.
8183,c.j.,Thank you.  This man has got to be stopped!
8184,bartlet, How do you do?
8185,bartlet,"Thank you, Ron."
8186,bartlet," I'm sorry we haven't had a chance to meet before now. You've been with  Zoey's detail, what?"
8187,bartlet,You were in the army?
8188,bartlet,How did you get there?
8189,bartlet,Where?
8190,bartlet,You were a Mountaineer.
8191,bartlet,With a degree in?
8192,bartlet,"So, you were commissioned a second lieutenant?"
8193,bartlet,How old are you?
8194,bartlet,How long have you trained for this assignment?
8195,bartlet,"What, were you the first one to sign up?"
8196,bartlet,All right.
8197,bartlet,"You know Zoey's dating my body man, Charlie Young, right?"
8198,bartlet,You know about the letters?
8199,bartlet,Are they white supremacists?
8200,bartlet,"You don't have an artist's sketch, or psychological profiles, or anything?"
8201,bartlet,It is.
8202,bartlet,"Okay. Zoey's 19 and she wants to be a teenager. She wants a college experience, and  I can't blame her. I loved college. So did my other daughters. I want Zoey to be  comfortable with her protection, I don't want her to try and give you the slip. It's  not your job to tell me she wants to cut English Lit, it's not your job to tell me if  she's dying her hair blue, or going to a strip club, or whatever it is she's doing  with her friends. You know what your job is."
8203,bartlet,Thank you.
8204,bartlet,Gina?
8205,bartlet,"If she's cutting English Lit, I want to know about it."
8206,bartlet,Okay.
8207,leo,Ethanol accounts for 20 percent of Iowa's corn crop.
8208,leo,That's what we never said enough.
8209,leo,"Sam's been calling senators from the plane for the past hour and a half. The next time  my phone rings, it's going to be him telling me it's over."
8210,leo,Yeah. 
8211,leo,Good morning. 
8212,leo, Okay.
8213,leo, Okay. 
8214,leo,"Look, I said I was sorry. "
8215,leo,I had to stay behind for this. 
8216,leo,"There will be other trips, Margaret. "
8217,leo,Good. 
8218,leo,"Yes, to California. "
8219,leo,They've got 54 electoral votes out there. Something tells me that we're not going to  be strangers. 
8220,leo, Yeah. 
8221,c.j.,"You guys? Everyone? Sorry, but we're landing in a few minutes, and I just wanted to brief  everyone on the President's schedule. The President will be greeted at the airport by  Congressmen Hark and Jennsen, the Mayor and various City Council Members. It's photos  only, no formal remarks. We will depart the airport at 6:20 and head for the hotel, at  which point I predict that we will no longer be on schedule. "
8223,josh,Yeah. 
8225,josh,"No, you're fine. "
8227,josh,"I've spent half the nights in my life in hotel rooms, and I still cannot... "
8229,josh,Later. You sure this isn't for your room? 
8231,josh,"Ugh, later. You sure? "
8233,josh,"Later. You know, there used to be keys... "
8235,josh,"You stuck it in, you turned it, you... "
8236,josh,I loosened it for you. 
8238,josh,Later. 
8240,josh,Really? 
8242,josh,She called? 
8244,josh,She's here. 
8246,josh,She's here in this hotel. 
8248,josh,Really. 
8250,josh,Why did she call? 
8252,josh,Really. 
8254,josh,Huh. 
8256,josh,"Well, that's something I really care about. "
8258,josh,I'll see her tonight. 
8260,josh,Interpreting the classics with Poet Laureate Donnatella Moss. 
8262,josh,"So, let's call her."
8264,josh,"Yeah. Let's do it. Call her, and then we'll do everyone else. "
8266,josh,Dial the phone. 
8268,josh,What? 
8270,josh,Hang on.  I'd better call him first. 
8271,josh,Good morning. You beat me to the door. 
8272,josh,I didn't know that. 
8273,josh,This is a beautiful house. 
8274,josh,I've been on a plane all night. 
8275,josh,"Seriously, Studio Chairman -- nice work if you can get it. "
8276,josh,What do you want to talk about? 
8277,josh,"Ted, I checked into my hotel room 15 minutes ago, what did you haul my ass out here for? "
8278,josh,Cameron's bill is a joke.
8279,josh,"It's the House. It's procedure. Do you know how many bills get introduced every day that  never get a hearing, let alone a vote? "
8280,josh,Yeah. 
8281,josh,"I came to you because you told me to, now I've got a cab waiting outside... "
8282,josh,Don't worry about it. 
8283,josh,You're worried about nothing. I'll see you later. The President's looking forward to  the party this evening. 
8284,josh,Ted. Ted? 
8285,josh,"You're a rotten bluffer, Ted. "
8286,josh,You're not going to cancel the fundraiser. 
8287,josh,This is the President. 
8288,josh,Ted. 
8289,josh,That was abrupt. I apologize. 
8290,josh,You can't cancel the fundraiser. 
8291,josh,This is ridiculous. You're going to be a joke to our people. 
8292,josh,Ted. 
8293,josh,"Ted, no one is going to pass a bill banning gays in the military. And if the House ever  passed such a bill, if the Senate every passed such a bill, the President would never  sign such a bill. "
8294,josh,Okay? 
8295,josh,"So, you're not going to flake on me. "
8296,josh,"So, the party's still on? "
8297,josh,Good. 
8298,josh,Look-- 
8299,josh,"That's not going to happen, and you know it. "
8300,leo,Yeah. 
8301,leo,"Good morning, Mr. Vice President. "
8302,leo,That's the way it's going to stay. 
8303,leo,"We talked to Huntington. We talked to Gianelli. We talked to Kelly, and Martinson,  and Rathburn. "
8304,leo,This morning. Nobody's moving. 
8305,leo,Not to me. I was surprised. 
8306,leo,Anyway. 
8307,leo,The President needs you to go down there and fulfill one of your two constitutional  responsibilities and vote for the ethanol tax credit. We need you to break the tie.  He also wanted me to tell you that he regrets putting you in this position. 
8308,leo,"John, I know exactly how you feel. "
8309,leo,I know... 
8310,leo,"16,000 new jobs. 4 billion dollars invested in plants and equipment, because the tax  credit made it economical. "
8311,leo,John? 
8312,leo,What's the point? 
8313,josh,I just came from Ted Marcus's. 
8314,toby,What did he want? 
8315,josh,He's threatening to cancel tonight unless the President comes out publicly against 973. 
8316,sam,This is one of Cameron's... 
8317,toby,It's not going anywhere. 
8318,josh,I explained that. 
8319,sam,And what did he say? 
8320,josh,"He takes it seriously for obvious reasons, and he is distressed by the President's silence  on the subject, and he feels that it's a betrayal of the gay community for him to be so  publicly supportive of the President. "
8321,toby,All right. It is not in the interest of his cause for the President to make a public  statement today. It'll give credibility and attention... 
8322,josh,Right. 
8323,sam,And use all those words when you talk to him. Tell him that surely a man of his media  savvy will understand that the President can't be quite so publicly blackmailed! 
8324,toby,"And, should the President choose to stay in his hotel room tonight and not kowtow to the  Hollywood blah, blah, blah, it will only serve to solidify his public reputation with the  electorate as a man of character. "
8325,sam,"Frankly, that buys us more than 2 and a half million dollars worth of support, anyway. "
8326,toby,"Use those words, and tell him if he goes ahead with the party, he gets 10 minutes alone  in a room with the President. "
8327,josh,"All right, I can sell that. "
8328,sam,Let's go back. 
8329,josh,How's he doing in there? 
8330,sam,"Oh, he's got that look on his face like he's thinking about ways to kill himself. "
8331,bartlet,"I'm sorry. I've actually been told that I have to go now. This is a debate that is  obviously going to continue in town halls, city halls, state legislatures, and the U.S.  House of Representatives. There is a population in this country that seems to focus so  much time and energy into this conversation, so much so that I am forced to ask this  question -- is there an epidemic of flag burning going on that I'm not aware of? "
8332,bartlet,"I mean it, man, is there an emergency-level outbreak of flag desecration no one's kept  me posted on? "
8333,toby,"There is not, so let's blow off the Kiefer meeting. "
8334,bartlet,"Toby, there is no reason for you to feel threatened by Al Kiefer. "
8335,toby,I don't. 
8336,bartlet,Excellent. Because we're doing it over lunch. 
8337,josh,I have to eat with Al Kiefer? 
8338,bartlet,Back at the Hotel. 
8339,josh,Sir. 
8340,bartlet,"Better, yet, Charlie, where is Zoey having lunch? "
8341,bartlet,Why? 
8342,bartlet,"That supposed to be a good place, Sam? "
8343,sam,"Uh, they make guacamole right in front of you. "
8344,bartlet,Is that an L.A. experience? 
8345,bartlet,"Well, there aren't going to be any people today. "
8346,bartlet,"Sounds like fun, doesn't it? "
8347,bartlet,"Yeah, but the hotel wouldn't make the guacamole right in front of me. "
8348,josh,"Sir, I need a minute to talk about Ted Marcus. "
8349,bartlet,We can do it in the car. Who's talking to Leo? 
8350,sam,"He's with the Vice President now, sir. "
8351,bartlet,"You come in the car, too. "
8352,toby,"Sir, this lunch with Al Kiefer? "
8353,bartlet, Those people over there don't like me too much. 
8354,josh,"Well, they just haven't taken the time to get to know you like we have, sir. "
8355,bartlet,"You would honestly think there was an epidemic of flag burning going on, endangering  countless lives in this country. "
8356,toby,Don't put too much stock in what he has to say. 
8357,bartlet,"I'm having lunch with my daughter, Toby. You guys are going to sit with Kiefer, and  let me know what's worth listening to. "
8358,toby,"Yes, sir. "
8359,bartlet, We'll see you there. 
8360,toby,"What, I'm not coming in the car? "
8361,bartlet,"No, and you know why? Because you made fun of the guacamole. "
8362,toby,I didn't! 
8363,bartlet,I could tell you were thinking it. 
8364,toby,Fair enough. 
8365,bartlet,Good. 
8366,bartlet,"Surprised you for lunch, I know, I'm the best. "
8367,bartlet,You are. 
8368,bartlet,"Yeah, but on the other hand, the guy made guacamole right in front of us. "
8369,bartlet,This is father/daughter fun time. 
8370,bartlet,"Oh, you know, I hadn't thought about that.  Now that you mention it, yeah,  I think you're right. "
8371,bartlet,"All kinds of things in California, Zoey. You've got your smog, your freeway shootings,  brush fires, mudslides. Plus, apparently, there's a mad rash of flag burning going on,  and you don't want a piece of that. "
8372,bartlet,"Right there, right in front of me, they made the guacamole. Now, how about that? "
8373,sam,I don't buy that. 
8374,toby,"Me, neither. "
8375,c.j.,People respect a President who stands by the courage of his convictions. 
8376,josh,Al. 
8377,toby,You just said that we couldn't. 
8378,sam,"You just said that if we were vocal in our opposition to flag burning, then we'd take  a fatal hit. "
8379,c.j., What? 
8380,bartlet,"C.J., has Al said something that I should listen to, yet? "
8381,c.j.,"We'll let you know, sir. "
8382,bartlet,What do you got? 
8383,josh,Why do you encourage him? 
8384,bartlet,"What do you got, Al? "
8385,josh,We've heard these numbers before. 
8386,bartlet,"Yeah, but I never get tired of hearing them, you know. Especially in front of my  daughter. "
8387,toby,Look... 
8388,josh,Excuse me. 
8389,toby,I just figured out who you were.
8390,toby,No. You're the guy that runs into 7-Eleven to get Satan a pack of cigarettes. 
8391,bartlet,"Yeah, Charlie.  "
8392,toby,We will? 
8393,bartlet,Yeah. 
8394,josh,Mr. President. 
8395,bartlet,Men with pools and patios think I'm weak. 
8396,josh,I don't want to mention the 49 times we asked you not to take this meeting. 
8397,bartlet,Was that Marcus on the phone? 
8398,josh,"Speaking of natives, we sold him on 10 minutes in a room alone with you, tonight. "
8399,bartlet,No way I can get out of it? 
8400,josh,Ten minutes. 
8401,bartlet,"I used to like parties, you know that? "
8402,c.j.,Look at this house! 
8403,toby,Yeah. 
8404,c.j.,"I mean, look at this house! "
8405,toby,It's a nice house. 
8406,c.j.,"You know, you haven't said anything about my dress. "
8407,toby,You look very nice. 
8408,c.j.,You're not even looking. 
8409,toby,I'm looking at the house. 
8410,c.j.,C.J. Cregg. 
8411,toby,Toby Ziegler. 
8412,toby,"Throw in a box of chocolates and a pair of nylons, get you a lot more than that. "
8413,c.j.,Sure. 
8414,toby,"I'll be over at the bar, drinking a lot, if anyone wants me. "
8415,c.j.,Nobody will.
8416,c.j.,Thank you. 
8417,c.j.,Doing what? 
8418,c.j.,Of what? 
8419,c.j.,What's that mean? 
8420,c.j.,Movies. 
8421,c.j.,You know what? You want Toby or Sam. I'm not a writer. 
8422,c.j.,"Well, I certainly can't direct or act. "
8423,c.j.,And what's that? 
8424,c.j.,"I thought a guy writes a movie, and a guy directs a movie. "
8425,c.j.,And in between there are designers and technicians and actors. 
8426,c.j.,"So, tell me what I do again? "
8427,c.j.,"Okay. Well, at the moment I have a pretty good job and I understand what it is, so,  uh, I sure appreciate...  Pretend you're talking to me. "
8428,sam,I am talking to you. 
8429,c.j.,Walk me outside. 
8430,sam,Did he offer you a development...?
8431,c.j.,Yes! 
8432,sam,"Me, too. Do you know what it is? "
8433,c.j.,No. 
8434,sam,"Me, neither. "
8437,josh, Excuse us. 
8439,josh,You're frightening the guests. 
8441,josh,He's married. 
8443,josh, Stop drinking now. 
8445,josh,I know that voice. 
8446,josh,"I got your phone message this morning, but I've been kind of running around. I didn't  see you until now. "
8447,josh,"Well, then you should have said hello to me. "
8448,josh,"I can assure you, I was not. "
8449,josh,"Well then, what? "
8450,josh,"Hello!  Look, uh, we're just here for the day... "
8451,toby, Josh! 
8452,josh,"Uh, yeah.  Can you not, uh, not, uh, just don't leave the party, okay? "
8453,leo,"John, I know we've had our ups and downs, but let me be your guy here for a second.  You can't be thinking about being the first vice president in history to break a tie  going the other way. "
8454,leo,"Then what are you looking for, John? You're going to get ink either way. "
8455,leo,"I know that it eats at you that there is friction between you and my staff. You think  they don't respect you. And they do. They just don't trust you. And frankly, neither  does the President. "
8456,leo,"I mean I know that's tough. But God, John, I'm the one that convinced him to put you  on the ticket. And I'm going to be the one standing here when you make history, whether  you're going to or not. "
8457,leo,"John, you will not be able to set foot in the West Wing. You will not be on the ticket  in three years. "
8458,leo,You think the President of the United States can arrange for a 50-50 tie in the Senate? 
8459,leo,You're wrong. 
8460,leo,At Ted Marcus's fundraiser. 
8461,bartlet,"We're running out of reasons not to fire him, Leo. "
8462,leo,"Well, when you run out of reasons, the last reason is that you can't fire the Vice  President. "
8463,bartlet,"I can ask for his resignation, and don't be a smart ass. "
8464,leo,"Mr. President, I got to tell you something and you won't like the sound of it. "
8465,bartlet,What? 
8466,leo,"He's right, and we're wrong. "
8467,bartlet,About what? 
8468,leo,About the ethanol tax credit. 
8469,sam,"Mr. President, Leo's right. "
8470,bartlet,Sam's weighing in. 
8471,sam,"Sir, I put Cambridge, Aiello and Dane in a headlock to vote our way, let's send them  back. We'll lose 53-47 and we can take the Vice President off the hook. "
8472,bartlet,"All right, let's do what Sam said. "
8473,leo,"Yes, sir. "
8474,bartlet,"I'm not done with Hoynes, but dump it. "
8475,leo,"Sir, the thing about the Vice President in this situation... "
8476,bartlet,"I'll call him from the plane.  Christ, will this damn day never end? "
8477,c.j.,C.J. Cregg. 
8478,c.j.,"Nice to meet you, too. Jay, can I talk to you for a second? "
8479,c.j.,"Uh, Jay, the President appreciates your laying off Leo McGarry the past few months.  It hasn't gone unnoticed. "
8480,c.j.,"Well, if there's anything I can do for you... "
8481,c.j., How does she  look like that? 
8482,c.j., I got to go. 
8483,c.j., Just pretend that you're talking to me again. 
8484,sam,"Okay. This time, let's use code names. "
8485,c.j.,Where's Josh? 
8486,sam,He's over there talking to that woman. 
8487,c.j.,Interesting. 
8488,sam,"Of course, it's just possible that they could just be pretending to be talking. "
8489,c.j.,Indeed. 
8490,josh,"So, you want to know what we did for lunch today? "
8491,josh,We had a meeting with a democratic pollster who told us that we could sew up  reelection if the President led the charge in favor a flag burning amendment. 
8492,josh,How'd you hear? 
8493,josh, Seriously... this guy had some pretty scary numbers. 
8494,c.j.,"Josh, I think I just made a three-picture deal. "
8495,josh,Three-picture deal doing what? 
8496,c.j.,It doesn't seem to matter. 
8497,josh,This is Joey Lucas. This is her assistant Kenny. 
8498,sam,You're running O'Dwyer's campaign in the 46th. 
8499,sam,Sam Seaborn. 
8500,toby,Toby Ziegler. 
8501,c.j.,C.J. Cregg. 
8502,josh,I was just telling her about Kiefer's numbers. 
8503,toby,And? 
8504,toby,"Please, please say that you did. "
8505,toby,That depends on the California numbers. 
8506,toby,You're looking very good to me right now. 
8507,toby,Good to meet you.  
8508,c.j.,Nice meeting you. 
8509,josh, Do you have any idea how big you scored with Toby and Sam right now? 
8510,josh,Your polls say that? 
8511,josh,"""The voice of the people is the voice of a dog""? "
8512,josh,God! Yes. 
8513,josh,I'm... I'm sorry? 
8514,josh,"Okay, um. I should go. I have to go. "
8515,josh,Absolutely. I will call in advance of my coming. 
8516,josh,"You, too."
8517,bartlet,"It's not going to pass, Ted. It's not going to get voted on. "
8518,bartlet,"And I'm saying as a gesture, as a symbol, you make that public demand, Ted, and you're  going to be Cameron's best friend. "
8519,bartlet,"Oh, God, Ted! Give me the name of one person who's complaining to you, and I'll call  them personally and tell them I will never sign a law like that. "
8520,bartlet,Ted. 
8521,bartlet, Don't you ever slap  Josh Lyman around again. That guy is the White House Deputy Chief of Staff. He's not  one of your associate producers. 
8522,bartlet,"Don't screw around with me now, Ted. I'm really not in the mood. "
8523,bartlet,"Right now, right this second, the worst thing that could possibly happen to gay rights  in this country is for me to put that thing on the debating table, which is happens  the minute I open my mouth. Do you get that? I'm a human starting gun, Ted. You got  to trust me! I know what I'm doing. "
8524,bartlet,Do you? 
8525,bartlet,Thank you. 
8526,bartlet,No. 
8527,bartlet,"Imagine how tired I'm going to look when you see me a couple of months from now.   I haven't slept well, lately. Kept everyone up on the plane as we flew out.  You know, we left at 3 in the morning? I really want to try to sleep on the way back. "
8529,josh,Yeah. 
8531,josh,She said she was with somebody. 
8533,josh,"Donna, she's with somebody! "
8535,josh,Why would she just be saying that? 
8537,josh,Oh. 
8539,josh,It's one in the morning. 
8541,josh,I'm not going to knock on her door at one in the morning. 
8543,josh,Are you okay? 
8545,josh,"Donna, I am not going to knock on her door"
8546,josh,"Were you just clucking like a chicken, is that what that was?"
8548,josh,"I couldn't knock on her door if I wanted to, I don't have her room number."
8551,josh,"Okay, first of all, don't do that thing anymore with the phone message! Phone message!"
8553,josh,"Tell them I'll be down in one minute. Wait, how's she going to know I'm knocking on  the door?"
8555,josh, Tell them I'll be there in a minute.
8556,josh,Al!
8557,josh,You know I got the wrong room.
8558,josh,Yeah.
8559,josh,"No! I'm not. I-I-I was just stopping to say a quick goodbye, don't bother."
8560,josh,"I wanted to say a quick goodbye. We’re taking off. And, uh, thank you for talking to  us tonight. That was helpful."
8561,josh,I know. 
8562,josh,Goodbye.
8563,bartlet," Anyway, Mr. Vice President, it's taken care of, we can put it to rest."
8564,bartlet,You're welcome. Bye.
8565,bartlet,Wait. John?
8566,bartlet,"I want to tell you, a couple of years ago in Iowa, I really admired the way you hung  in there on the ethanol tax credit. You went out to Iowa and said the same things  you'd been saying in the Senate for eight years, event though you knew it wasn't going  to play. My confession is, you and I agree on ethanol, but you were the only one to  say it. You stood in there even though you knew you were going to lose Iowa and who  knows what after that. Anyway, I just wanted to say you had a good day today, John."
8567,bartlet,I'm going to try to go to sleep now.
8568,bartlet,Yeah.
8580,sam, When did Jeffery happen? 
8581,sam,"Lilly, when did Jeffery happen? "
8582,sam,Let's find out. 
8583,sam,Yeah. 
8584,sam,What? 
8585,sam,Why? 
8586,sam, Lilly? 
8587,sam," News cycle doesn't belong to us, Lilly. It's not ours to give away. "
8588,sam,We want to show that the President is reaching out to Congress for a Budget  compromise. He's literally going to Congress. 
8589,sam,It's a symbol. 
8590,sam,Your guy's married to our guy and our guy won an election. That's something you people  are gonna have to get used to. 
8591,sam,"Ah, point well argued.  "
8592,sam,That was a pretty good pitch to inning. 
8593,sam,Lilly... 
8594,toby, Change the channel. 
8595,toby, Change to Channel 5. 
8596,sam,What happened? 
8597,toby,Bernie Dahl died. 
8598,sam,You just lost your news cycle. 
8599,bartlet, Is here going to be a coup? 
8600,bartlet,Is there going to be a coup? 
8601,bartlet,And this is on page.... 
8602,bartlet,Page 17. 
8603,leo,Excuse me... Mr. President. 
8604,bartlet,Yeah?   Leo... Intelligence briefing. 
8605,leo,I know. 
8606,bartlet,There are mornings I'm just nodding my head. That can't be good for anybody. 
8607,leo,Bernie Dahl had a heart attack. 
8608,bartlet,No! 
8609,leo,Yeah. He died about an hour ago... 
8610,bartlet, He died?!? 
8611,leo,...on the way to the hospital. Bad timing. 
8612,bartlet,I'll say. Who knows so far? 
8613,leo,We got it off the news. 
8614,bartlet,Dammit. 
8615,leo,Yeah. 
8616,bartlet, The market is going to open 200 points down. 
8617,leo,If we're lucky. 
8618,bartlet,When was the last time we were lucky? 
8619,leo,Super Tuesday. 
8620,bartlet,It's going to be 300...350. 
8621,leo,Announce Ron Ehrlich. 
8622,bartlet,Not yet. 
8623,leo,Announce Ron Ehrlich as Dahl's successor. 
8624,bartlet,Not... yet. 
8625,leo,You do it this morning when trading opens everyone calms down. 
8626,bartlet,I'm not saying I'm not sure it's Ehrlich. 
8627,leo,Sir... 
8628,bartlet,I'm saying I'm not sure. It's the Fed Chairman. Give me a day. 
8629,leo,It's gonna be an expensive day. 
8630,bartlet,How expensive. 
8631,leo,You say 300 points. It could be more. 
8632,bartlet,Wall Street needs to trust me. 
8633,leo,Should I go tell them that?
8634,bartlet,A day. I'll tell you something else. You could have been nicer to me during this  conversation. 
8635,leo,How? 
8636,bartlet,By saying that Wall Street does trust me and the market will hold until I appoint  a new Fed Chairman. 
8637,leo,Sure. Just give me a minute to call my broker and dump my portfolio. 
8638,bartlet,I'm taking the day. 
8639,leo,"I'm going to leak it, sir, on account in the next hour people will calm things down. "
8640,bartlet,No. 
8641,leo,Mr. President! 
8642,bartlet,I'm not ready to jump into bed with Ron Ehrlich yet. I'm one of the few people in my  family who can say that. 
8643,leo,"Yes, sir. "
8644,bartlet,So...  That's was page 17? 
8646,josh,I'm...on the phone.
8648,josh,How do you know? 
8650,josh, What book? 
8652,josh,"Donna, the fact that I'm on hold right now this shouldn't be your cue to tell  me what like was like 100 years ago. "
8657,josh,I'm actually back on the phone now. 
8660,josh,I'm gonna go to my meeting now. But you sit here and keeping talking. It'll be like  I never left. 
8662,josh,Thank you. 
8664,josh,What? 
8666,josh,100 years ago? 
8668,josh,What were they driving? 
8670,josh,Horses! 
8672,josh, When do you have time to read these books?!? 
8674,josh,I notice you're able to do it right here at the office. 
8676,josh,Among other things. 
8677,toby,Sam? 
8678,sam,Yeah? 
8679,toby,C.J. gonna need a reason why the President's waiting a day that doesn't sound like  we're reconsidering Ehrlich. 
8680,sam,I just gave her one. 
8681,toby,What? 
8682,sam,Respect. 
8683,toby, The man just died... out of respect for his memory... his family... 
8684,sam,It would be wrong to name a successor on the day he... 
8685,toby,Respect works.
8686,toby,Okay that didn't seem to be about anything that interests me. 
8687,sam,"I'm just saying. Bernie Dahl has a heart attack, BAM!.... right out of nowhere. "
8688,toby,It's his fifth heart attack Sam. He was 138 years old. 
8689,sam,Yeah but these are highly stressful jobs. I haven't been to the gym in three weeks. 
8690,toby,"Sam, look at yourself. How much healthier do you want to be? "
8691,sam,I'm just saying if anybody need me at lunch I'm gonna be at the gym. And that's  gonna be sad for me because I'm gonna live longer than you. 
8692,toby,Don't count on it. 
8693,sam, Hey. 
8694,josh,Hey.  Toby.... 
8695,toby,"We are waiting a day to make our announcement out of respect, Josh. "
8696,josh,For whom? 
8697,toby,The dead. 
8698,josh,Oh. 
8699,toby,And how I wish I were one of them. 
8700,josh,Now...You're gonna love this meeting! 
8701,toby,Betcha I'm not. 
8702,josh,Toby.... 
8703,toby,It's locked down. 
8704,josh,I know that! 
8705,toby, It's locked down with some 15 votes to spare. 
8706,josh,There is value for having these three Congressmen on board. 
8707,toby,What is it? 
8708,josh,A... A clear and public demonstration that the President's liberal base hasn't  turned their backs. 
8709,toby," In the case of these three people, I'd like to see a clear and public  demonstration that they've turned their backs and run as far as humanly possible. "
8710,josh,I think you think it's beneath you to ask. 
8711,toby, We've got the trade bill. It's sewn up! And it's as bipartisan as we're  likely to see. There was a victory and we're the victors. And I'm not going in there  hat in my hands. 
8712,josh,No one's asking you too. 
8713,toby, You're asking me too! 
8714,josh,"No, we're gonna do good cop, bad cop. "
8715,toby,No...we're really not.
8716,josh,Why not? 
8717,toby,"Cause this isn't an episode of Hawaii 5-0. How about you be the good cop, I'll  be the cop who didn't go to the meeting. "
8718,josh,You have to go to the meeting. I told them you would be at the meeting. If you're  not there they're gonna start right out insulted. 
8719,toby,I go to this meeting there's a decent chance we end this meeting with them insulted.  So... 
8720,josh,Let's go. 
8721,toby,I need to exercise more. 
8722,josh,Toby... 
8723,toby,I gotta exercise more. I gotta eat better. 
8724,josh,"Toby, you're gonna sit in that room and you're gonna behave yourself. I swear  to God, you are gonna sit there while I court these peoples votes and every  so often you're gonna smile so as to indicate warmth. "
8725,toby,"I can still kick the crap outta you, though. We're clear on that, right? "
8726,josh,Yeah. 
8727,toby,Then what the heck are we waiting for? 
8728,josh,Toby... 
8729,toby,I'll be nice. 
8730,josh,The President's very serious about this. 
8731,toby,He shouldn't be. 
8732,josh,"So you've told him many times but here these people are. So, I guess the President  disagrees with you... Given that... "
8733,toby,I understand. Let's go. 
8734,josh,So you're just gonna sit there. 
8735,toby,Yeah. 
8736,josh,If you open your mouth it will be to say something nice. 
8737,toby,Yes. 
8738,josh,Come on. 
8739,toby," It's sewn up, Josh. "
8740,josh, Whatever. 
8741,toby, By 15 votes. 
8742,josh,Morning. 
8743,josh,How are you? 
8744,josh,Nice to see you. Thanks for coming. 
8745,josh,How you been? 
8746,c.j.,He is shocked and saddened by the death of his colleague. For over 11 years  Bernard Dahl oversaw the largest economic expansion in the country's history  and I can assure you he will be.... 
8747,c.j.,...missed.  Katie?
8748,c.j.,There are a number of very good candidates.
8749,c.j.,"I want to be clear, no such list exists. Obviously from his post as the number  two man at the Federal Reserve, Ron Ehrlich is a candidate."
8750,c.j.,Sidney Bloom is a candidate. 
8751,c.j.,Mr. Ottenberg is a candidate. 
8752,c.j., I'm aware of no such declaration. 
8753,c.j.,I don't know who the unnamed people are. But I suppose it's possible on a social  occasion... 
8754,c.j.,We're hoping to have it done tomorrow. 
8755,c.j., Respect. 
8756,c.j.,Get me a copy of the wire report? 
8757,c.j.,Could I have sounded any stupider saying respect? 
8758,c.j.,Sam. 
8759,sam,Yeah? 
8760,c.j.,I need you. 
8761,sam,I'm going to the gym. 
8762,c.j.,I got a question about Mrs. Bartlet stating her preference for Ron Ehrlich. 
8763,sam,Publically? 
8764,c.j.,It's in a wire piece that's on my desk. 
8765,sam,Ginger! 
8766,sam,Yep! 
8767,c.j.,Thank you! 
8768,sam,Hi.
8769,sam,I didn't. 
8770,sam,"Well that solves that, then. "
8771,sam,"And I just want to make sure we're the ones calling the plays in the huddle, Lilly. "
8772,sam,C.J. got a question regarding the First Lady's preference for Ron Ehrlich. 
8773,sam,This time it was in a wire piece...'Sources close to Mrs. Bartlet'. 
8774,sam,It wasn't you... 
8775,sam,"Okay, we'll let you know when we want something leaked. You know that, right? "
8776,sam,"C.J. didn't come up here, I did. No one's calling you a liar. "
8777,sam,No we don't. We need to find a way for your staff to work better with our staff. 
8778,sam,"Look, I'm... "
8779,sam,Lilly? 
8780,sam, I'm going to the gym now. 
8781,sam,Okay. 
8782,bartlet,Without regard to the validity of past arguments. 
8783,leo,That the National Debt was so high it required us to suck up to the bond market. 
8784,bartlet,Yes and I'm saying that condition doesn't exist anymore.
8785,leo,"Well, maybe so. "
8786,bartlet,"Historically, American prosperity has been built the broad growth in the GDP  of 5% of greater. And now with the deflationary pressures of the Global Economy,  that kind of growth can be achieved without the negative side affects of rampant  inflation.  Do you understand what I'm saying?"
8787,leo,C.J. doesn't understand a word you're saying. 
8788,c.j.,I understand the  I really don't understand anything. 
8789,bartlet,My point is Ron Ehrlich might not be the guy. I'm saying it's not a mortal lock. 
8790,c.j.,"So let me suggest, Mr. President, that I talk to the First Lady and ask her to clarify... "
8791,bartlet, No... 
8792,c.j.,...that her position... 
8793,bartlet,"No, no... "
8794,c.j.,"""My husband will choose the best man for the Fed...."" "
8795,bartlet, Noooo... 
8796,c.j.,"..."" I support whatever..."" Sir! "
8797,bartlet,"C.J., we don't handle my wife. When we try, do you know what happens at the other  end of this building?  "
8798,c.j.,You get a little punishment. 
8799,bartlet,I get a little punishment. Screw it. Let's move on. It's not a big deal.  
8800,c.j.,"Yes, sir. "
8801,bartlet, Can I do that? 
8802,leo,Yeah. 
8803,bartlet,"Yeah, Leo says I can do that. It's gonna be Phyllis who has never liked me.  It's gonna be Susan who thinks I'm xenophobic because I don't like Mexican food.  These are my wife's friends. "
8804,bartlet,Yes.  They're still angry at me 'cause  I accidentally ran them over with my car. 
8805,bartlet,"Thank you, Mrs. Landingham. "
8806,c.j.,Anything else? 
8807,bartlet,No. 
8808,c.j.,"Thank you, Mr. President. "
8809,bartlet,"Thank you, C.J. "
8810,bartlet,I'll tell you what else; historically 2 to 2 ½ GDP expansion is classified  lack luster even anemic economic growth.  Four ½ to 5% is needed just to be considered robust and not even spectacular. 
8811,leo," You know, sometimes I don't know what you're talking about. "
8812,bartlet,Sometimes I'm just making it up. 
8813,bartlet,"Hello, sweetheart. "
8814,leo,"What's up, Zoey? "
8815,leo, Hmm? 
8816,bartlet,Who the hell knows?  
8817,leo,Anything else? 
8818,bartlet,No.
8819,leo,"Thank you, Mr. President. "
8820,bartlet,"Thank you, Leo. "
8821,bartlet,What you got today? 
8822,bartlet,How about math. Why aren't you taking math? 
8823,bartlet,"Wiseass all you want, but you're coming of age in the 21st century. A century  in which I promise you mathematics is going to play a starring role. On the  other hand I would definitely put my shoulder into Intro to Cinema. Intro to  Cinema's what got me where I am today. "
8824,bartlet,That was going to be a big part of my day. 
8825,bartlet,I met with Butterfield and some Secret Service Agents this morning. 
8826,bartlet,You didn't do anything. They think you should be taking more math. 
8827,bartlet,It's time for me to tell you about some letters we've been getting. 
8828,bartlet, Yeah. They don't like that the daughter of the President is dating a young  black man. 
8829,bartlet,"Zoey, please don't tell me you're dating more than one guy. "
8830,bartlet,Ok. 
8831,bartlet,Cause one guy for you is actually one more than I'm comfortable with.
8832,bartlet,I could see it's had a real impact on you. 
8833,bartlet,No worse than any of the stuff they intercept. 
8834,bartlet,Yeah. Why did Butterfield and the guys meet with me? Apparently there's National  Convention of some sort in Virginia. It was in the papers yesterday that you  and Charlie are going to some club opening this weekend. 
8835,bartlet,"You don't have to cancel, but you can't bring Charlie. "
8836,bartlet,You want me to tell him? 
8837,bartlet,You gotta tell him he truth Zoey. Don't make something up. 
8838,bartlet,You sure you don't want me to come? 
8839,bartlet,Okay. 
8840,bartlet,Yeah?
8841,bartlet,Okay.  You gotta go. 
8842,bartlet,I never really new him that well. 
8843,bartlet,I don't know. You want the job? 
8844,bartlet,Can't have it. Know why? 
8845,bartlet,Not enough math. Bye. 
8846,josh,"We don't. We like lower tariffs. Lower tariffs on everything from Indian textiles,  to German cars to Chilean wines negotiated by our trade reps in Geneva with  130 other countries over the past 7 years. Global Free Trade Markets Access  Act now has cleared the President and we're very proud it's finally ready to  be voted on by the House. "
8847,toby, Where it will win by the way by some 15 votes. 
8848,josh," Thank you, Toby. "
8849,toby,Anyone eating that donut? 
8850,josh," Now, what happens when you lower the  cost of something, Economists of every stripe, including the one in the Oval Office,  say you that you get a more efficient allotment of economic resources. Now that may  not sound like much to you and me but to an Economist that's a week in St. Barts."
8851,toby,You're concerned about American labor and manufacturing?
8852,toby,What kind of car do you drive? 
8853,toby,Then shut up. 
8854,josh,What Toby meant to say is we don't get to see you guys often... and it's a  crying shame. 
8855,josh," Uh, think about what you'd like to eat for lunch. "
8856,toby, Also think about that we won and we're here still courting  your vote for reasons passing understanding. 
8857,josh,Get out here. 
8858,josh,This... right here. This is why you have a reputation as a pain in the ass. 
8859,toby,I've cultivated that reputation. 
8860,josh,Could I get you to try harder in there? 
8861,toby,"Sure, cause right now I'm not trying at all. "
8862,c.j.,"Guys, I'm standing here. I don't know if you've.... "
8863,josh,Yeah? 
8864,c.j.,The wire has a piece. It'll be picked up. 'Sources close to the First Lady say that  she'... 
8865,toby,Ron Ehrlich? 
8866,c.j.,Yeah. 
8867,josh,Who are the sources? 
8868,c.j.,I don't know. Sam spoke to Lilly. She doesn't know a thing about it. 
8869,josh,Is it Lilly? 
8870,c.j.,Yeah. 
8871,toby,Mrs. Bartlet should slide in and step in the back door. 'Ron Ehrlich is an old  friend but she supports whatever'... 
8872,c.j.,Yeah. She's not going to unless someone tells her to. 
8873,toby," Well, that sounds an awful lot like your job, C.J. "
8874,c.j.,"Well, I was just in there and he doesn't want me to handle the First Lady. "
8875,josh,Did he say he didn't want you to 'handle the First lady cause he didn't want you to'  or did he say it like 'handle the First Lady but I'm not the one who told you to?' 
8876,c.j.,That's what I don't know. 
8877,josh,You gotta learn the signs. 
8878,c.j.,I've got most of the signs. 
8879,josh,You don't have that one! 
8880,c.j.,I'm learning that one. 
8881,toby,Where's Sam? 
8882,c.j.,He went to the gym. 
8883,toby,Page Sam and tell him I want him to talk to Lilly again. 
8884,c.j.,What if the President meant it? 
8885,toby, We're not handling Mrs. Bartlet. We're talking to her staff. Page Sam. 
8886,c.j.,I know most of the signs. 
8887,toby,Go! 
8888,josh,So what would you have done if the guy told you he drove and American car?
8889,toby,Find some other way of humiliating him. 
8890,josh,"You like winning, don't you? "
8891,toby,Saves you from having to say the word please. 
8892,josh,Let's go. 
8893,toby,Absolutely. 
8894,sam,Ow! 
8895,sam,"Ah, Congresswoman...yes. I'm fine, thanks. "
8896,sam,I'm just trying to get healthy. 
8897,sam,I'm fine. 
8898,sam, How can I help you? 
8899,sam,Congresswoman? 
8900,sam, Okay.
8901,sam,Josh and Toby say we're 15 votes up. 
8902,sam,"Yeah, we're meeting with some friends of your right now to try to run up the score. "
8903,sam,Okay. 
8904,sam,Okay. 
8905,sam,"Becky, tell me you're not offering an amendment. "
8906,sam,Becky...
8907,sam,You can't. 
8908,sam,She didn't...
8909,sam,You're not being left of anything. 
8910,sam,This is why we fast tracked this to avoid this kind... 
8911,sam,I understand.... 
8912,sam,This is gonna blow the vote outta the water. Joshua and Toby have a hard nose count  that puts us over... 
8913,leo,Danny? 
8914,leo,You don't have to get off. 
8915,leo,Take a walk with me. I'm on my way out. 
8916,leo,We noticed that ourselves. 
8917,leo,Yes. 
8918,leo,It'll be fine. 
8919,leo,We will. 
8920,leo,I had a hunch. 
8921,leo,The President was wondering if you have a few minutes to spare at the end of the day. 
8922,leo, It'll just be you. It'll be informal and off  the record. They'll be a reception at five for the Michigan Women's Democratic Caucus.  He'll step out for a few minutes. 
8923,leo,What? 
8924,leo,Like the place will be lousy with female Democrats? 
8925,leo,Yeah. 
8926,leo,Thanks. 
8927,c.j.,"Hello, Daniel. "
8928,c.j.,I don't have time to talk to you now. 
8929,c.j.,Sam? 
8930,sam,Yeah? 
8931,c.j.,I paged you. 
8932,sam,Yeah. I got your page and thanks. I hit my head. Becky Reeseman came over. I've got  to talk to Josh and Toby.
8933,c.j.,I need you for a second first. 
8934,sam,What is it? They stop. 
8935,c.j.,I mentioned the wire piece to the President. 
8936,sam,What did he say? 
8937,c.j.,He said he doesn't want the First Lady handled. 
8938,sam,Did he mean it or did he mean he wants you... 
8939,c.j., I don't know. 
8940,c.j.,I don't have that sign. 
8941,sam,You gotta pick up the signs. 
8942,c.j.,I've got most all of them. 
8943,sam,"Yeah well, it's an important one to learn. "
8944,c.j.,Toby thinks if you talk to Lilly Mays again... 
8945,sam,Clarification. 
8946,c.j.,Staffer to Staffer. Gently nudge her in that direction. 
8947,sam,"Yeah, all right. Where are Josh and Toby? "
8948,c.j.,They're still in their meeting. 
8949,sam," Gotta learn the signs, C.J.. "
8950,c.j.,I know! 
8951,josh,"No, but.... "
8952,toby,I can. 
8953,josh,Toby...  
8954,toby,I can deny it. Range Rover inspired Ford to design the Explorer. Which is the best  selling vehicle in its class and Ford's most successful model in years. 
8955,josh,Will you excuse us for a moment? 
8956,toby,Many... many things. 
8957,josh,"I have to say if there's been improvement in your attitude, it's marginal. "
8958,toby,"We're in hour number four, you understand. "
8959,sam,Guys... 
8960,josh,Yeah?
8961,toby,I thought you were at the gym. 
8962,sam,I was. And then Becky Reeseman came over to talk to me. She made it very clear it was  just a courtesy. 
8963,josh,What'd she say? 
8964,sam,She's attaching... 
8965,toby,No! 
8966,sam,She's attaching a Child Labor Amendment. 
8967,josh,To what? 
8968,toby, To this. 
8969,josh,She can't! 
8970,sam,She is. 
8971,josh,When? 
8972,sam,Tonight. 
8973,josh,This is why we fast tracked it! 
8974,sam,She's on ways and Means. 
8975,toby,She was serious? This wasn't one of her funny jokes? 
8976,sam,She was inspired by the First Lady. She thought this morning there were trumpets and  she doesn't want to... 
8977,toby,There were trumpets? 
8978,sam,The trumpets called...The trumpets sounded...
8979,toby,What the hell goes on at that gym? 
8980,sam,She thinks the train is leaving the station and she wants to be out front of it. 
8981,josh,Somebody's' got to talk to Mrs. Bartlet. Tell her to get Becky Reeseman to back off. 
8982,toby, I refuse to relay these instructions. 
8983,josh,I'll talk to Lilly Mays. 
8984,sam,I'll do it. I'm already going in there on the Ron Ehrlich thing. 
8985,josh,Okay. 
8986,sam,"If I'm gonna take a hit, I might as well take two. "
8987,toby,Press upon her the following: It's taken 7 years to get the bill this far. It's  locked down. Add this amendment and now I've got to go back in there and be nice  to these people! 
8988,josh," Bring this one home, Sam. "
8989,josh, After you. 
8990,toby,After you. 
8991,sam,Hey there. 
8992,sam,Is Lilly in? She's expecting me. 
8994,sam,Mrs. Bartlet. 
8996,sam,"Yes, ma'am. "
8998,sam,Mrs. Bartlet.... 
9000,sam,No ma'am. I don't think it is. 
9002,sam,"No ma'am, I don't think you are. "
9004,sam,"I like Lilly Mays. I think she's top notch, you know that. You know that it was hard  for us to give her up. "
9006,sam,I think you're prone to amateur mistakes. 
9008,sam,"Mrs. Bartlet, you can't go on national television and decide to have a kid sit  next to you on a whim. You gotta vet this stuff through my office. "
9010,sam,There was nothing wrong with the interview except it looked like you discovered  there was a child labor problem because a 14-year-old boy named Jeffery just  told you about it this morning. 
9012,sam,"And I don't not believe that exercise is gonna make me any healthier. But I  didn't go to medical school, you did. You say so and I go to the gym."
9014,sam,"Mrs. Bartlet, I say this with all respect but you have to talk to Becky Reeseman  and tell her not to offer that amendment tonight. "
9016,sam, Excuse me? 
9018,sam, Okay. 
9020,sam,"No, ma'am. "
9027,bartlet,Danny... 
9028,bartlet,Please.  
9029,leo,"Hey, Danny. "
9030,bartlet,Yes. 
9031,leo,I'd just like to say right off the bat that I strongly urged the President not  to have this conversation. So I'm just a guy sitting here. 
9032,bartlet," We note with surprise your lack of conviction, Leo. "
9033,leo," Note it well, Sir. "
9034,bartlet,"I miss our late night talks, Danny. "
9035,bartlet," Out there in the campaign trail.... Ames, Iowa...Tulsa... Skokie,  Center City, Tallahassee, Albany...San Antonio, Jasper, Wyoming. "
9036,bartlet, We got very close. 
9037,bartlet,You covered the First Lady as well. 
9038,bartlet,You literally wrote the book on my wife. 
9039,bartlet,Once again I want to emphasize the strong personal bond we built on the campaign... 
9040,leo," Oh, for God's sake. "
9041,bartlet, ...in a... proper...  gentlemanly... 
9042,leo,Even Byzantine... 
9043,bartlet,...way... 
9044,bartlet,Danny. 
9045,bartlet,You must save me from having this conversation with my wife. 
9046,bartlet,Or at least make it seem like I'm better armed than I evidently am. 
9047,bartlet, Danny... 
9048,bartlet,We're off the record. 
9049,bartlet,"Welcome to the club, Danny. We had some jackets made. "
9050,leo,Let him go. 
9051,bartlet," I'm not kidding...a personal  bond here, Danny."
9052,bartlet," You're coaching my Personal Aide on how to best score with my daughter?  Yes, Danny, that does make me feel better. "
9053,bartlet,Go away. 
9054,leo,"Thanks, Danny. "
9056,josh,The Hundred Years ago thing? 
9058,josh,Why would anyone want to diminish a woman's sexual desires? 
9060,josh,Here we go. 
9073,bartlet,The rhythm of the sewing machine petals? 
9074,leo,"That's what it says.  ""Marijuana, heroin, morphine were all available over  the counter in drug stores. According to one Pharmacist, heroin clears the completion,  gives buoyancy to the mind, regulates the stomach and bowels and is in fact the perfect  guardian of health."" Now they tell me. "
9075,leo, I'm outta here. 
9076,bartlet,Stay. 
9077,leo,Right. 
9078,bartlet,Chicken. 
9080,bartlet,Hello. 
9082,bartlet,Abbey? 
9085,bartlet,"Well, your Chief of Staff is a very attractive woman. Maybe he was, you know... "
9087,bartlet,"Abbey, I told C.J. specifically... "
9089,bartlet," No, she didn't. "
9091,bartlet,She didn't get the signal wrong. I wanted her to send someone. 
9093,bartlet,"This wire thing is a problem for me. The kid on TV was a mistake. And the amendment,  from Becky Reeseman... "
9095,bartlet,...will bring down a trade bill that's been worked on for years. 
9097,bartlet, Fine.
9099,bartlet,I staffed it out to C.J.. 
9101,bartlet,That's right. 
9104,bartlet," Then don't play me, Abbey! Don't work me! A lot of people  around here think it was Lilly Mays, who planted you have a preference for Ron Erlich! "
9106,bartlet, I know it wasn't Lilly Mays. It was you! 
9108,bartlet, Yes! 
9110,bartlet," Well you put me in a bit of a spot there, Abigail. I name Ron Erlich now,  which I was going to do anyway, and it makes me look like I'm taking instructions  from my wife! "
9112,bartlet,Are you talking about you or me? 
9114,bartlet," I'll walk up to the hill right now, and I will give the Speaker of  the House my resignation. "
9116,bartlet, Do you want to see me get on the phone and put it in session?! 
9118,bartlet," It was nine months, Abbey. Not six months. And I waited a day on Skippy,  because the fed chair is a fairly important position, and I wanted to make damn  sure my decision was right. "
9120,bartlet,How the hell do you know? 
9122,bartlet,Yes. 
9124,bartlet,Yes. 
9126,bartlet,On that point I concede the high ground. 
9128,bartlet,Good. 
9130,bartlet,"No, no however. Just be wrong. Just stand there in your wrongness and be wrong, and  get used to it. "
9132,bartlet,"Nine months, Abbey. "
9134,bartlet,Yes? 
9136,bartlet,"Abbey, please. "
9138,bartlet, Yeah. 
9140,bartlet,Okay.  We just had our first Oval Office fight. 
9142,bartlet,Did you talk to Zoey today?  
9144,bartlet,"Maybe she'll be so traumatized by this experience, that she'll never date another  boy again. "
9146,bartlet,"Don't finish that sentence, I'm a man of questionable health.   The Michigan women are waiting for me. "
9148,toby,Put it down! Put it down! Put it down!
9149,toby,No champagne.
9150,toby,"Put it down. Everyone in this room let me have your attention, please. The law of our  land mandates that Presidential appointees be confirmed by a majority of the Senate.  A majority being half plus one for a total of what, Ginger?"
9151,toby,"51 yea votes is what we see on the screen before a drop of wine is swallowed! Because  there's a little thing called what, Bonnie?"
9152,toby,"“Tempting fate” is what it's called.  In the three months this man has been on my radar screen, I have aged 48 years. This is  my day of jubilee and I will not have it screwed up by what, Bonnie?"
9153,toby,"By tempting fate! These things take patience. These things take skill. These things take  luck. In the 15 months we've been in office, what kind of luck have we had, Ginger?"
9154,toby,What kind of luck?
9155,toby,We've had very bad luck.  Where's Josh?
9157,josh,Yeah.
9159,josh,What's this message about I've got to talk to Mandy about a banana bar? Is that what  this says?
9161,josh,“Panda bear?”
9163,josh, That's a “d”?
9165,josh,And that's an “e”?
9167,josh,"All right, you know what would be helpful? If you could just show me where one word  ends and the next one begins."
9169,josh,She wants to talk to me about a panda bear?
9171,josh,You're sure you got the message right?
9173,josh,No.
9175,josh,"A panda’s what I think it is, right?"
9177,josh,"Little Australian thing, eats bark off a koala tree?"
9179,josh,The panda's the other one...
9181,josh,"You know, for someone who hasn't quite mastered the alphabet..."
9183,josh,"Your penmanship is illegible. Hey, Mal."

9194,josh,What the hell?
9195,toby,Ginger?
9196,josh,Okay.  Go grab Leo.
9198,josh,Go.
9200,josh,Please get Leo.
9201,leo, I can't believe you're talking like this.
9202,leo," It's a book jacket, Sydney. It's a dust cover."
9203,leo, We're really going to make a federal case out of a book jacket? I mean  we're literally going to make a federal case out of this?
9204,leo," Sydney, I'm going to bring him up here and talk to him, but I got to  say... we're about a minute and a half from closing what wasn't the easiest confirmation  process in American history, so you'll understand if I'm not giddy as a schoolgirl about  the thought of running once again into the warm embrace of the Senate Judiciary Committee."
9205,leo,Goodbye.
9206,leo,An appointment to a Justice post favors reparations to African-Americans.
9207,leo,Capturing their ancestors and keeping them as slaves.
9208,leo,Money.
9209,josh,Loser!
9210,sam, Toby!
9211,toby,Not yet.
9212,sam,Our day of jubilee.
9213,toby,Not yet.
9214,sam, It's my day of jubilee.
9215,sam,"All right, the day was a little bit better a few seconds ago, but that's all right."
9216,sam,Which position paper?
9217,sam,"No, honestly I am dumb. Most of the time I'm playing smart."
9218,sam,"Mallory, you can't be thinking about ruining my day of jubilee by yelling at me about  school vouchers."
9219,sam,Mallory...
9220,josh,"50! Here we go, baby!"
9221,leo,Sam. Toby. You're about to put a guy on the Supreme Court.
9222,sam,Toby? How about now?
9223,josh,I don't understand. Salvador Dali had distinctive penmanship?
9225,josh,How was it distinctive?
9227,josh,He was Spanish.
9229,leo, Excuse me. Am I interrupting something important?
9230,josh,I can't even begin to tell you how you're not.
9231,leo, Would you mind if I have a...
9232,josh,What's up?
9233,leo,Our nominee for Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights.
9234,josh,It's going to sail?
9235,leo,"No, it's not."
9236,josh,Jeff Breckenridge?
9237,leo,Stadler has a problem with him.
9238,josh,What's his problem?
9239,leo,He supports slavery reparations.
9240,josh,Since when?
9241,leo,Whenever.
9242,josh,I mean... was there a thing? 
9243,leo,Two sentences on the back dust jacket of a book that's coming out called The Unpaid Debt.
9244,josh,That's it?
9245,leo,Stadler's unhappy.
9246,josh,Cause of a thing he wrote on a dust cover?
9247,leo,"I've been singing that song for the last three hours. So talk to him tomorrow, would you?"
9248,josh,Stadler?
9249,leo,Breckenridge.
9250,josh,I'm not the guy for this.
9251,leo,"Yeah, you are."
9252,leo,What the hell is that?
9253,josh,C.J.'s going to do “The Jackal.” 
9254,leo,"Oh, where she lip synchs to the thing?"
9255,josh,Yeah.
9256,leo, I love that.
9257,josh,Toby's better for this. Look at the job he did on the Mendoza confirmation.
9258,leo,Toby's barely alive as a result of the Mendoza confirmation. This one's you. Let's go  watch “The Jackal.”
9259,josh,Leo...
9260,leo,Yes.
9261,josh,I'm a white guy from Connecticut.
9262,leo,"We've met, Josh."
9263,josh,"I'm saying, isn't this kind of a delicate subject for me to get into with a black civil  rights lawyer from Athens, Georgia?"
9264,leo,"Remember, you're also Jewish."
9265,josh,Then he's sure to love me.
9266,leo,Yeah.
9267,leo,Cathy! Where's Sam?
9268,leo,Tell him to come to the Press Room. He's not going to want to miss “The Jackal.”
9269,sam,It was a position paper.
9270,sam,How did you get this paper?
9271,sam,Your father gave you my position paper?
9272,sam,See. I think he's trying to drive a wedge between us.
9273,sam,Look...
9274,sam,Yes?
9275,sam,I'll be right there.
9276,sam,We do.
9277,sam,"I... first of all, hang on. We haven't been on a date yet."
9278,sam,And what kind of dates have you had that you're amazed this hasn't come up?
9279,sam,"Seriously. The other guys. They order drinks and they say, ""Before we go any further,  I'd like you to know my position on school vouchers?"""
9280,sam,No.
9281,sam,"No. Because you know why? Because I am off duty. Toby and I have spent the last three  months putting a guy on the bench. The sun has set and I have earned my government  salary and then some. I'm done working. And we haven't been out on a date and that's  supposed to be tonight. Now we’re going to go in there and watch C.J. do “The Jackal.”  And believe me, if you haven't seen C.J. do “The Jackal,” then you haven't seen  Shakespeare the way it was meant to be done. We're going to watch C.J. do “The Jackal”  and then we're going to get a late dinner, after which I may or may not kiss you good  night. ‘Cause there is something going on between us, Mallory. But frankly, I don't  think you're doing a very good job on your part, so I've decided to take over."
9282,sam,Yes. Let's go.
9283,sam,"I didn't think so, but you got to give me credit for trying."
9284,sam,Apparently you don't have to give me credit for trying.

9286,josh,There's a little speed bump with Jeff Breckenridge. Leo gave it to me because he thinks  you're burned out after Mendoza. I said I thought that was ridiculous. What do you think?
9287,toby, Are you talking to me... during “The Jackal?”
9288,josh,I was just...

9292,sam,Hey.
9293,leo,Hey.
9294,sam,So Mallory read my position paper on school vouchers.
9295,leo,Really?
9296,sam,Yeah.
9297,leo,How do you suppose she got a hold of that?
9298,sam,"Well, as it turns out, you gave it to her."
9299,leo,Hmmm. School vouchers is a serious subject with Mallory.
9300,sam,"Yeah, thanks for the heads up."
9301,leo,"I don't mind you dating my only daughter, but you can't expect me not to have some fun  along the way."

9310,c.j.,Why'd you come down?
9311,c.j.,You should have gotten here earlier.
9312,c.j.,What happened?
9313,c.j.,Is there any chance David Arbor is not the son of Bob Arbor?
9314,c.j.,"One, there's one other thing?"
9315,c.j.,What?
9316,c.j.,"Well, at least I know what I'll be doing when I come into work tomorrow. "
9317,c.j.,Make sure you remind my office.
9318,c.j.,Go home.
9319,c.j.,Do this... I'm honestly not sure the President even knows.
9320,c.j.,"Yeah, you know why? Because it's such a non-story it hasn't come up yet today. Say it now."
9321,c.j.,The kid's father's a major Democratic fundraiser.
9322,c.j.,The President’s daughter was at a party where there was a drug bust.
9323,c.j.,Has the President had any reaction at all?
9324,c.j.,There it is.
9325,c.j.,It's a non-story.
9326,josh,Hey.
9327,josh,"Yeah, you didn't want to talk to me about banana bars by any chance, did you?"
9328,josh,Donna has stylish penmanship.
9329,josh,"You say that now, but I'm the one who's going to end up feeding him and walking him."
9330,josh,What happened to the old bear?
9331,josh,Okay.
9332,josh,Did I kill her?
9333,josh,Then what are you talking to me for?
9334,josh,Did I write any of them?
9335,josh,Then once again...
9336,josh,About getting a new panda bear?
9337,josh,To replace Lum-Lum?
9338,josh,Toby. You should be talking to Toby. 
9340,josh,Thanks.
9341,josh,Yeah. Toby can help you out.
9342,josh,I have to tell a black civil rights lawyer why I don't owe him any money.
9343,josh,Thanks.
9344,sam,This draft is done.
9345,sam,"This draft is done, and it's done on schedule. On schedule is going to be my middle  name from now on. Seriously. I'm having it legally changed."
9346,sam,Norman.
9347,sam,"Speaking of schedules, Cathy."
9348,sam,The noon meeting with Brennan and Landis on the Hill?
9349,sam,Let's see if we can cancel it.
9350,sam,I don't want to go.
9351,sam,I really don't want to go.
9352,sam,Okay. 
9353,sam, What?
9354,sam,What do you mean I've got Mallory?
9355,sam,What appointment with Mallory?
9356,sam,Mallory.
9357,sam,Why aren't you in school?
9358,sam,You made an appointment?
9359,sam,We're not dating.
9360,sam,You made an appointment?
9361,sam,"Well, isn't that adorable? Come in."
9363,josh,Is he here?
9365,josh,Send him in.
9367,josh,"Jeff, I'm Josh Lyman."
9368,josh,Good to meet you. Help yourself to a chair. Can Donna get you anything?
9369,josh,You were a second year summer intern at Debevoise and Plimpton when my father was a  partner there. 
9370,josh,Yeah.
9371,josh,Yeah.
9372,josh,He died.
9373,josh,The night of the Illinois primary.
9374,josh,"Thanks. Listen. I just got this handed to me last night, so I'm not as up to speed as  I'd like."
9375,josh,Stadler.
9376,josh,Probably.
9377,josh,No.   There's a book coming out by Otis Hastings called The Unpaid Debt.  Hastings' position is that African Americans are owed monetary reparations for slavery.
9378,josh,You're quoted on the back jacket.
9379,josh,"You wrote, ""Otis Hastings is a unique and extraordinary historian. This book should be  read by everyone and burned into the minds of white America."""
9380,josh,"Just to start, you weren't misquoted... right?"
9381,josh,"Okay. And I'm assuming that if asked by the Committee, you'll say that you favor  reparations?"
9382,josh,And you're looking for back pay?
9383,josh,Just out of curiosity... did you have a figure in mind?
9384,josh,What is it?
9385,josh,"Okay. Listen, this is probably a better discussion to have in the abstract, don't you  think?"
9386,josh,What do you mean?
9387,c.j.,Yeah.
9388,c.j.,"Yes indeed. Charlie, Charlie, Charlie, Chaz."
9389,c.j.,“The Jackal?”
9390,c.j.,I can bring it. What's up?
9391,c.j.,What'd she do?
9392,c.j.,"Edgar Drumm isn't a reporter. He's a professional Bartlet baiter, and the Charleston  Citizen isn't a newspaper, it's fund-raising newsletter for the radical right. What'd  he ask her?"
9393,c.j.,Did she talk to him?
9394,c.j.,I can talk to a couple of people.
9395,c.j., Carol!?
9396,c.j.,Tell Danny I'm coming to see him.
9397,c.j.,I drove my boyfriend's Porsche once.
9398,c.j.,Backed it into a pond.
9399,c.j.,And the boyfriend.
9400,c.j.,Yeah.
9401,toby,"Hey there, Margaret."
9402,toby,Yeah. Why wouldn't I be okay?
9403,toby, What do I usually say?
9404,toby,Not today.
9405,toby,"You, on the other hand, should turn that frown upside down."
9406,toby,"Let your smile be your umbrella, Margaret."
9407,toby, Gray skies are going to clear up... Hi Bobby. Put on a happy face. Hi Janet.
9408,sam,We have people on the payroll who are experts at obfuscating the Constitution.
9409,sam,Anything else?
9410,sam,"We've been here for an hour, Mallory."
9411,sam,We're offering a solution for that.
9412,sam,"Mallory, everything that you're saying makes sense. I just think that the state of  urban schools is such that if you can save even one kid..."
9413,sam,Tell me how.
9414,sam," Public education has been a public policy disaster for 40 years. Having spent  around four trillion dollars on public schools since 1965, the result has been a steady  and inexorable decline in every measurable standard of student performance, to say  nothing of health and safety. But don't worry about it, because the U.S. House of  Representatives is on the case. I feel better already."
9415,sam,What?
9416,sam,"Well, hang on. These are office hours. If I'd know I was working on that I would have  had a whole different attitude."
9417,sam,Thank God.
9418,sam,"The meeting on the Hill. I'd love to keep talking, Mal, but I have this meeting on the  Hill."
9419,sam,Why?
9420,sam,"Yes, I did."
9421,c.j.,Danny?
9422,c.j.,You hear anything about Edgar Drumm talking to Zoey?
9423,c.j.,What?
9424,c.j.,Danny.
9425,c.j.,Edgar Drumm.
9426,c.j.,That's what I heard. 
9427,c.j., What? 
9428,c.j.,Danny?
9429,c.j.,Yeah.
9430,c.j.,Nothing.
9431,c.j.,Nothing. Those really are nice suspenders.
9432,josh,What? 
9433,josh,Mules.
9434,josh,40 acres and a mule.
9435,josh,Catchy.
9436,josh,A lesson well learned. But let's talk about your confirmation.
9437,josh,"And while we're on the subject of the Civil War, let's remember the 600,000 white men  who died over the issue of slavery."
9438,josh,"It's why a lot of them died, Jeff. And there's no other place and time in recorded  history where an event like that has occurred. So... let's... leave it at that and  move on."
9439,josh,Except to say this...
9440,josh,Nothing.
9441,josh,Let’s move on.
9442,toby,Mandy.
9443,toby,"Madeline, you are charming and you are brilliant and for you, I have all the time in  the world."
9444,toby,"Bonnie, you are dedicated and you are beautiful. And Ginger, you are other nice things."
9445,toby,You bet.
9446,toby,"Mandy, I feel like I've lost a hundred and eighty pounds. I'm smiling. I’m laughing.  I'm enjoying the people I work with. I gotta snap out of this.   What's on your mind?"
9447,toby," Well, that did the trick."
9448,c.j.,Yeah.
9449,c.j.,Thanks. 
9450,c.j.,"Hey, Zoey, thanks for stopping by. Carol, can you get the door?"
9451,c.j.,Edgar Drumm.
9452,c.j.,But he pushed your buttons a little.
9453,c.j.,Did you tell him that you didn't know that David Arbor was going to be at the party?
9454,c.j.,"Okay... Zoey, I need to know why you lied to him."
9455,c.j.,And I need to know why you're lying to me right now.
9456,c.j.,"If you didn't know he was going to be there, why'd you have his car keys with you?"
9457,c.j., Hi.
9458,c.j.,They told me you were having a briefing. I didn't want to intrude.
9459,c.j.,I just needed a minute.
9460,c.j.,I'm fine. I just needed to talk to you about the party last night.
9461,c.j.,"Could you describe what, if any, contact Zoey might have had with David Arbor last night?"
9462,c.j.,I don't understand.
9463,c.j.,Zoey's not in trouble.
9464,c.j.,I'm trying to straighten out a discrepancy with what she told me.
9465,c.j.,"Gina, I'm the press secretary. There's a story that Zoey's involved with, and I need you  to tell me what you know about last night."
9466,c.j.,"Okay, thanks. "
9467,c.j.,Okay. Thanks. I appreciate it. Sorry about the...
9468,c.j.,I’ll see you later.
9469,c.j.,Why?
9470,c.j., See you later.
9471,sam,"It occurs to me Mallory, that you attended a private primary school, a private high  school and a private college."
9472,sam,"Well, just that liberals have no problem with rich kids going to expensive private  schools, that doesn't undermine public education. And liberals have no problem with  middle-class kids going to parochial schools, that doesn't undermine public education."
9473,sam,"The idea that letting poor public school students choose private alternatives would  destroy public education is simply contrary to our experience. Boston Latin, the oldest  public school in America, is still the best secondary school in New England."
9474,c.j.,"Excuse me. Hey, Mal."
9475,c.j., You got a second?
9476,sam,Absolutely.  Excuse me.
9477,c.j.,Edgar Drumm ambushed Zoey when she was coming out of lunch.
9478,sam,On campus?
9479,c.j.,Yeah. She said she didn't know David Arbor was going to be there when she did know  David Arbor was going to be there.
9480,sam,Why did she lie?
9481,c.j.,Spend all day surrounded by reporters? It starts to become instinct.
9482,sam,It doesn't sound too bad. Let's just make sure the President doesn't get involved.
9483,c.j.,Yeah... well... when he hears someone tried to talk to her on campus... 
9484,sam,You're going to have to sit on it.
9485,c.j.,I'm not going to be able to.
9486,sam,You have to.
9487,c.j.,Sam?
9488,sam,"C.J., you can't back down in front of him. You got to get in his face."
9489,c.j.,Get in the President's face?
9490,sam,Yeah.
9491,c.j.,That's your advice?
9492,sam,Yeah.
9493,c.j.,Okay.  Does anyone else have any advice... that could... uh...
9494,sam,"C.J., listen to me. It's your job. It's what he needs you to do."
9495,c.j.,Yes.
9496,sam,Can I ask you something?
9497,c.j.,Sure.
9498,sam,I would like to see Mallory socially...
9499,sam,But I can't seem to get her past this fight that we're having.
9500,c.j.,Tell her you want to continue the fight over lunch.
9501,sam,That's good.
9502,c.j.,Yeah.
9503,sam,That's very good advice.
9504,c.j.,"Yeah. It's certainly better advice than ""get in the President's face."" "
9505,sam,I'm going to go back into my office.
9506,c.j.,Cool. I'm going to go check the want ads.
9507,sam,Good luck.
9508,toby,A panda bear to replace Dim Sum?
9509,toby,Do you mean Hsing-Hsing?
9510,toby,I know.
9511,toby,Ling.
9512,toby,It may have been Ping.
9513,toby,I know exactly how he felt.
9514,toby,Yes.
9515,toby,"I think it would be a good idea, as a symbol... to signal that China is serious about  their relationship with us, if they stopped running over their citizens with tanks. "
9516,toby,Mandy! Call the embassy and have them send us over a damn bear. What's the problem?
9517,toby,We only need one.
9518,toby,Why?
9519,toby,The other one will get lonely. Well then have them send us two.
9520,toby,"Then get us two regular bears, a bucket of black paint, a bucket of white paint,  bam, bam, next case."
9521,toby,I know. I'm Mr. Wildlife.
9522,toby,Mandy! 
9523,toby,What made you think I'd be interested in this?
9524,toby,Josh.
9525,toby,Said I was your man.
9526,toby," Oh... I have to say, Mandy... I'm impressed with how much you've grown."
9527,toby,"Well, there was a time if you got played by Josh like this, you'd want to get back at  him right away, and it's good to see you rise above that."
9528,toby,He used you to have a little fun with me ‘cause he has to deal with Breckenridge on  slavery reparations.
9529,toby,"Yeah, but it’s good to see you get past that."
9530,toby,Like a two-dollar banjo.
9531,toby,Do what?
9532,toby,Hmm... Okay.
9533,leo,"Yeah.  Hold on, please. "
9534,leo,What do you need my permission to have lunch for?
9535,sam,She says she always asks her father's permission before she has lunch with fascists.
9536,leo,"Oh. Yeah, okay."
9537,leo,"No, Mallory. He's really not."
9538,leo,"No, he's not."
9539,leo,It's opposition prep.
9540,leo,"When we're gearing up for a debate, we have the smart guys take the other side."
9541,sam,Yes.
9542,sam,You made an appointment.
9543,leo,Would the two of you take it outside?
9544,sam,I thought you were trying to drive a wedge between us.
9545,leo,"Yeah, but now you're just boring the crap out of me."
9546,sam,"Mallory, education is the silver bullet. Education is everything. We don't need little  changes. We need gigantic monumental changes. Schools should be palaces. The competition  for the best teachers should be fierce. They should be making six-figure salaries.  School should be incredibly expensive for government and absolutely free of charge to  its citizens, just like national defense. That’s my position. I just haven't figured  out how to do it yet."
9547,sam,And we can continue the argument. But it's lunchtime now. We're going to have lunch.
9548,sam,I'm taking over.
9549,leo,"Yes, you may go have lunch with the fascist."
9550,leo,You're doing fine.
9551,sam,Okay. 
9552,bartlet,Charlie.
9553,bartlet,I heard. It's the first time anyone's canceled lunch on me since I took office.
9554,bartlet,I'm not saying he didn't have a good excuse.
9555,bartlet,Rules of Civility and Decent Behavior in Company and Conversation by George Washington.
9556,bartlet,"The rules were drawn from an English translation of a French book of maxims. Washington  copied them down when he was 14 years old.  ""When you sit down, keep your feet  firm and even, without putting one on the other or crossing them. Put not off your  clothes in the presence of others, nor go out of your chamber half-dressed."" What a  tightassed little priss he must've been."
9557,bartlet, Do you think I could take George Washington?
9558,bartlet,I don't know... a war?
9559,bartlet,Yeah.
9560,bartlet,The Minutemen were good.
9561,bartlet,Yeah. 
9562,bartlet,You can send her in.
9563,c.j.,Mr. President.
9564,bartlet," ""When in company, put not your hands on any part of your body not usually  covered."""
9565,c.j.,"Well... I do what it takes to keep the press corps happy, Mr. President."
9566,bartlet,"Yeah, you're right. What's going on?"
9567,c.j.,"Don't blow your stack, all right?"
9568,bartlet,What is going on?
9569,c.j.,Zoey lied to a reporter.
9570,bartlet,What are you talking about?
9571,c.j.,She was asked should the President's daughter be partying with drug dealers and she  said she didn't know David Arbor was going to be at the party. Except she did know.
9572,bartlet,Why did she lie?
9573,c.j.,She didn't have to.
9574,bartlet,Then why did she?
9575,c.j.,‘Cause sometimes 19 year-old girls lie when they don't have to.
9576,bartlet,She never has to.
9577,c.j.,She knows that.
9578,bartlet,Apparently she doesn't.
9579,c.j.,"Mr. President... give her a break. This thing's happened to her friend, she doesn't  know how it affects her father. Edgar Drumm is shouting at her while she comes out  of class. She choked."
9580,bartlet, A reporter talked to her on campus?
9581,c.j.,Mr. President...
9582,c.j.,Sir...
9583,bartlet, Put the press in the briefing room. Tell them I'm coming  right over.
9584,c.j.,No.
9585,c.j.,No sir.
9586,bartlet,We have been over this and we have been over this and we have been over this! They are  not supposed to talk to my daughter on campus.
9587,c.j.,It was Edgar Drumm.
9588,bartlet,I don't give a damn if it was the Bergen County Shopper's Guide. I want to talk to the  press.
9589,c.j.,You can't talk to the press!
9590,bartlet,Watch me.
9591,c.j.,"I'm telling you now, Mr. President, this isn't about your daughter! It's about the first  daughter and that's my job and you're not going down there! You, me, Charlie and Zoey  are the only four people who know she was lying and there's no reason it doesn't need  to stay that way. It's a non-story. You go down there and it's a big story!"
9592,bartlet,So I just sit in my office and fume?
9593,c.j.,"Yes. And if anybody asks you, you haven't heard anything about it."
9594,bartlet,Fine.
9595,c.j.,Mr. President? 
9596,bartlet,What?
9597,c.j.,Did you know he jumped out at Zoey? Gina Toscano put him into a wall?
9598,bartlet,Excellent.
9599,c.j.,Sir...
9600,bartlet,I haven't heard anything about it.
9601,c.j.,Very good.
9602,bartlet,"I could take George Washington, by the way."
9603,c.j.,"Yes, sir."
9604,bartlet,Anything else?
9605,c.j.,"No, sir."
9606,bartlet,"Thank you, C.J."
9607,c.j.,"Thank you, Mr. President. "
9608,josh,I knew you were going to bring up the Japanese.
9609,josh,They were actually in internment camps. Bring me a living slave and then you've got a case.
9610,josh,"Jeff, the committee is going to be looking for a certain degree of practicality. We don't  have $1.7 trillion. To raise $1.7 trillion, we would have to sell Texas and the U.S. Navy."
9611,josh,How about you take it in affirmative action and empowerment zones and civil rights acts?
9612,josh," You know, Jeff... I'd love to give you the money, I really  would. But I'm a little short of cash right now. It seems the S.S. officer forgot to  give my grandfather his wallet back when he let him out of Birkenau."
9613,josh,You're damn right it is! 
9614,josh,What the hell are we talking about?
9615,josh,Yes.
9616,josh,Yes.
9617,josh,Yeah.
9618,josh,No.
9619,josh,Yeah.
9620,josh,"Yeah, okay.  Hey, Jeff."
9621,josh,"There’s going to be a lot of these meetings before your confirmation. Why don't you let  me get lunch this time, you get it next time?"
9622,josh,Hey Suzanne.
9623,toby,Is it gonna rain?
9624,sam,No.
9625,toby,It looks like it’s gonna rain.
9626,sam,It’s overcast.
9627,toby,Isn’t that usually what it is before it rains?
9628,sam,Yes.
9629,toby,But in this case?
9630,sam,It’s not gonna rain till later today.
9631,toby,"If it rains, please remember to change the opening line."
9632,sam,"It’s not gonna rain till one, maybe two o’clock."
9633,toby,"Yeah, but if you’re wrong, you gotta change the opening line!"
9634,sam,"I’m not getting this from morning drive-time radio, Toby. I’m getting this from First  Lieutenant Emily Lowenbrau of the U.S. Coast Guard, who would not let me down ‘cause  she has a very really...a very comforting voice."
9635,toby,"Okay, here’s my thing. If you’re wrong, if the coast guard is wrong, the remarks open  with “As I look out over this magnificent vista.” If the event gets moved indoors, he  will no longer be looking out over a vista of any kind."
9636,sam,Do you honestly think he can’t change that on his feet? Do you honestly think the  President doesn’t know where he is when he’s giving a speech?
9637,toby,"This isn’t a major policy address, Sam. This is five minutes in front of the United  Organization of Trout Fishermen. I’m saying if it gets moved inside."
9638,sam,I got this from the U.S. Coast Guard. I got this from the National Weather Service.  They use satellites. They use technology.
9639,toby,"This is the same satellite technology we use to detect intercontinental ballistic  missiles, right?"
9640,sam,Yeah.
9641,toby,All right then.
9642,c.j.,We should move the thing inside.
9643,toby,Sam says it’s probably not gonna rain till later.
9644,c.j.,Have either of you heard anything about a piece of paper that’s going around?
9645,sam,What piece of paper?
9646,c.j.,"I don’t know. At the Gaggle, Dave Trillin asked what I knew about a piece of paper  that’s going around. Maybe you used from the campaign."
9647,sam,I haven’t heard anything.
9648,c.j.,Me either.
9649,toby,Let’s find out.
9650,c.j.,"That’s good advice, Toby."
9651,leo,We’re in the second floor auditorium in the O.E.O.B.
9652,c.j.,And they’re moving people inside?
9653,leo,People are there. They moved them twenty minutes ago.
9654,sam,Why?
9655,leo,The weather report said it was gonna rain.
9656,sam,It did?
9657,leo,Yeah.
9658,sam,Is it possible First Lieutenant Emily Lowenbrau is yanking me around?
9659,toby,Where’s the President?
9660,leo,He’s already over there.
9661,c.j.,How’s his mood today?
9662,leo,"We had breakfast. He seemed very upbeat, very energetic, very optimistic about the day."
9663,c.j.,How long do you think do you suppose that’s gonna last?
9664,bartlet,Can we get this Godforsaken event over with so I can get back to presiding over a  civilization gone to hell in a handcart?
9665,bartlet,Leave me alone.
9666,bartlet,What what is?
9667,bartlet,There’s nothing wrong with my mood.
9668,bartlet,Would you get off me with that?
9669,bartlet,I know I’d like to beat you senseless with a head of cabbage. I know that for damn sure.
9670,bartlet,"Charlie, does anyone have my remarks?"
9671,bartlet,Is Toby on his way?
9672,bartlet,Why aren’t they here right now?
9673,bartlet,"Nothing like surrounding yourself with the best and the brightest, Charlie."
9674,toby,"Good morning, sir."
9675,c.j.,"Good morning, Mr. President."
9676,sam,"Good morning, sir."
9677,bartlet,Hello.
9678,toby,"How are you, sir?"
9679,bartlet,You didn’t know it was raining?
9680,toby,"To our credit sir, we knew it was raining once it started to rain."
9681,bartlet,Okay.
9682,sam,"Here are your remarks, sir."
9683,bartlet,"A couple of things, uh, who am I gonna be talking to now?"
9684,sam,The United Organization of Trout Fishermen.
9685,bartlet,"No, seriously now."
9686,sam,Sir?
9687,bartlet,Give me the damn speech.
9688,sam,There’s some very nice anecdotes there about trout fishing.
9689,bartlet,Have I ever been trout fishing?
9690,sam,Probably not.
9691,bartlet,Okay.
9692,josh," Good morning, Mr. President."
9693,bartlet,What’s going on Josh?
9694,josh,"The C.V.O.’s gonna revise its outyear projections, two commissioners resigned from the  F.E.C. this morning, and the N.G.A. endorsed trigger locks."
9695,toby,How much?
9696,josh,The projections?
9697,toby,Yeah.
9698,josh,"Uh, maybe 200 billion?"
9699,bartlet,Hang on.
9700,bartlet,Two F.E.C. commissioners resigned?
9701,josh,Yes sir.
9702,bartlet,There are two seats open in the F.E.C.?
9703,josh,Yeah.
9704,leo,Sir?
9705,bartlet,This is interesting.
9706,leo,"Sir, this is not the world’s best time to go off on a flight of idealistic-"
9707,bartlet,"Leo, two seats just opened up in the Federal Election Commission."
9708,leo,And the Senate Leadership will fill them.
9709,bartlet,"I’m saying, what if this time we say we want our guys?"
9710,leo,We won’t win.
9711,bartlet,"Yeah, but we can dangle our feet in the water."
9712,leo,"It’s not a good idea, sir."
9713,bartlet,Josh-
9714,leo,"Mr. President, you’re thinking about changing the nature of democracy."
9715,bartlet,"I’m talking about dangling our feet in the water. Josh, get Leo two candidates who back  aggressive campaign finance reform."
9716,josh,"Sir, I-I got to stand with Leo on this. I think that-"
9717,bartlet,"I’m not saying jump off the boat, Josh. I’m saying dangle our feet."
9718,josh,"Yes, sir."
9719,bartlet,Yes. Somebody?
9720,sam,The United Organization of Trout Fishermen.
9721,bartlet,Thank you.
9722,leo,"You gonna concentrate on this now, or is your head gonna be in changing the nature of  democracy?"
9723,bartlet,"No, I’m definitely gonna be thinking about the trout fishermen, Leo, ‘cause that’s  where my focus should be."
9724,leo,"You were in a better mood an hour ago, Mr. President."
9725,bartlet,"I was in a better mood a year ago, Leo."
9726,c.j., Does anybody know anything about a piece of paper that’s been going  around?
9727,leo,What piece of paper?
9728,c.j.,I don’t know.
9729,bartlet,"C.J., are you taller than you usually are?"
9730,c.j.,Yes sir. I’m my usual height.
9731,leo,Okay.
9732,bartlet,"Couldn’t pick a trout out of a police lineup, by the way."
9733,leo,Focus.
9734,josh,Two Federal Election seats open on the same day?
9735,leo,"You can dream all you want Josh, but you’re dead in the water, it’s never gonna happen."
9736,josh,"That’s what I thought too, but after your little pep talk just now..."
9737,toby,Sam?
9738,sam,Damn it!
9739,leo,What?
9740,sam,I forgot to do something.
9742,josh,Six commissioners are appointed for a six-year term.
9744,josh,Two seats come up every two years.
9746,josh,At the same time.
9748,josh,Including this time?
9750,josh,Once.
9752,josh,Yes.
9754,josh,There’s a couple of roadblocks.
9756,josh,"Whenever a vacancy comes up, the party leadership of both sides...  Did you just  call me “baby” back there?"
9758,josh,"Okay. Uh, when a vacancy comes up, it’s up to the President to fill it, but the party  leadership on both sides always, always, always dictates to the President who he’s gonna  appoint. One Republican. One Democrat. Whoever the leadership says. That’s how you keep  the peace."
9760,josh,"No, but I’m gonna spend the rest of the week trying."
9762,josh,You’re right. I’m gonna need a bagel. 
9763,c.j.,"The Easter egg hunt and the Easter egg roll are two different things. The theme of this  year’s event is “Learning is delightful and delicious,” as, by the way, am I."
9764,c.j.,"The collection, which is gonna be on display on the east colonnade to the White House,  features real chicken eggs decorated by artists from each of the 50 states and the  district. And the activities are coordinated by the American Egg Board. And I’ve hung  with some of the cats from the American Egg Board, and they are party people.  Thank you. That’s it for this afternoon."
9765,c.j.,Steve?
9766,c.j.,You got a second?
9767,c.j.,What have you heard about a piece of paper that’s out there?
9768,c.j.,What’s that?
9769,c.j.,That’s it?
9770,c.j.,"If you hear anything more, you’ll tell me first?"
9771,c.j.,I keep forgetting you don’t work for me.
9772,c.j.,See ya.
9773,c.j.,"Mandy, there’s a buzz in the room. Something about a piece-"
9774,c.j.,Do you know anything about it?
9775,c.j.,What do you mean?
9776,c.j.,What is it we’re uh...
9777,c.j.,"Katie, they’re in the blue room."
9778,c.j.,"You worked for us for a year and a half, and you work for us again now..."
9779,c.j.,"...And in between, you wrote a playbook on how to beat us?"
9780,c.j.,I need to see a copy of it right now!
9781,leo, Margaret!
9782,leo,I can’t e-mail.
9783,leo,What’s the problem?
9784,leo, No.
9785,josh,Hey.
9786,leo,"Oh, hey Josh."
9787,leo,"Oh Margaret! Margaret! I’m sorry. I’m gonna have to...I hung in there as long as I  could, but you long since passed the point when I stopped caring. If you’re curious,  it was right around raisin muffin."
9788,leo,And fix the e-mail.
9789,leo,"So, who’d you come up with?"
9790,josh,John Bacon and Patricia Calhoun.
9791,leo,"Oh, I know John Bacon. Who’s the other?"
9792,josh,Patty Calhoun’s the director of the Roe Institute for Economic Policy Studies at the  Heritage Foundation. She worked in the White House O.M.B. under two Republican Presidents.
9793,leo,And she favors campaign finance overhaul?
9794,josh,Aggressive overhaul.
9795,leo,Then the leadership’s gonna hate them both.
9796,josh,What do you want me to do?
9797,leo,Meet with the top guys in the leadership offices.
9798,josh,You want me to meet with the leadership?
9799,leo,"Absolutely not. I want you to meet their guys, and I want you to do it outside the  building. Do it over a meal."
9800,josh,"Leo, the President can’t think we’re gonna get anywhere with this, can he?"
9801,leo,Hmmm?
9802,josh,"The President doesn’t think we’re gonna get anywhere with this, can he?"
9803,leo,No.
9804,josh,Okay.
9805,josh,What happened with e-mail?
9806,leo,"Oh, I don’t know. It has something to do with the President’s Council on Physical Fitness."
9807,josh,Okay.
9808,sam,Hey.
9809,toby,Who’d you come up with?
9810,josh,John Bacon and Patty Calhoun.
9811,sam,Not in a million years.
9812,josh,Tell me something else I should know. What are you doing?
9813,toby,It’s our turn with the boys.
9814,josh,Knock ‘em dead.
9815,sam,"Hey, listen."
9816,toby,Yeah?
9817,sam,You want me to do the talking when we get in there?
9818,toby,Why?
9819,sam,Just asking.
9820,toby,"Good morning. Good morning. We all know each other. Why don’t we sit down? We’ve been  conducting meetings with various senior staff on the D.O.D., N.S.C. and House and  Senate Armed Services. We feel a little hamstrung because of the policy inherited  regarding gays and lesbians in the military. And we’d like as much reform input as  possible before making a recommendation to the President."
9821,toby,Sure.
9822,toby,"Well, actually, it’ll be Sam’s recommendation to the President. It’s on his desk, and  I’m just helping out."
9823,sam,"Major, bearing in mind that the President seldom, if ever, listens to my recommendation,  I’d imagine the consequence to be little."
9824,sam,"Congressman, the commander-in-chief orders that gays can serve openly in the military.  That’s the way it’s gonna be, and anybody who chooses to disobey that order can stand  court marshal under the uniform code and military justice."
9825,toby,I guess it’s gonna be a pretty short meeting.
9826,c.j.,Yeah?
9828,c.j.,What are the other eggs made out of?
9830,c.j.,They’re actually eggs.
9832,c.j.,What is Josh doing?
9834,c.j.,Would you tell him when he has a free moment I’d like to see him?
9836,c.j.,"Carol, 25,000 wooden eggs."
9837,c.j.,They’re just regular eggs.
9838,c.j.,Is that it?
9839,c.j.,Who has it?
9840,c.j.,But somebody does.
9841,c.j.,Okay. I’m gonna read it now.
9842,c.j.,"Go back to your office, and don’t answer any questions."
9843,c.j.,I’d count on it.
9844,josh,"Soft money contributions render the 1974 Campaign Reform Act toothless. Soft money  contributions, which were ostensibly designed for party-building, whatever that might  mean, do nothing but eviscerate any meaningful election controls. We are, by definition,  corrupt."
9845,josh,"I know you wouldn’t, Steve. This money isn’t coming in in 5’s and 10’s and 20’s. It’s  coming in in denominations of 100, 200, 500 thousand dollars. It’s coming from special  interests. It’s coming from special interests whose interests aren’t the same as those  who don’t have a half a million bucks lying around, and it’s not going to party-building.  It’s going to issue ads. It’s going to candidates."
9846,josh,"If the insurance company wants to buy ad time from 64 major markets, they are free to do  so. If the airplane manufacturing industry wants to back a candidate, they are free to  shout from the rooftops. If big tobacco wants to wave a sign or put a bumper sticker on  their cars, they are free to do so. That’s free speech. Money isn’t speech."
9847,josh,"I came here as a courtesy, Jerry. I came at the request of Leo McGarry. The President is  strong considering... John Branford Bacon and Patty Calhoun to fill in the two seats."
9848,josh,Two people who oppose any campaign finance reform. Well...
9849,josh,He raised a lot of money in Indiana. And Joe Barkley says that people are allowed to  spend whatever they want in politics.
9850,josh,Really?
9851,josh,The President makes appointments to the Federal Election Commission.
9852,josh,Wouldn’t it be easier to just not confirm our nominees?
9853,josh,"Are you saying that in addition to voting down our nominees, there’s gonna be political  retribution for having nominated them in the first place?"
9854,josh, Reject whatever you want.
9855,josh,"I said reject whatever you want! You know, four hours ago, this was a fool’s errand for  me, and the President knew it. This was a test balloon. This was a “just out of curiosity  let’s see what would happen if” meeting, but you’ve managed to get me on board."
9856,sam,Officer...
9857,sam,"No, it doesn’t."
9858,sam,Do you like to know how much it doesn’t? Eleven hundred and forty-five were discharged  from being gay in 1998. 
9859,toby,That’s a record.
9860,sam,"It’s a 92% increase since “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” was implemented. 414 Air Force  discharges--the highest in two decades. 271 of them during basic training at Lackland  Air Force Base. 271 during basic training."
9861,toby,"Major, what the hell is going on at Lackland Air Force Base?"
9862,toby,I get that a lot.
9863,c.j., Excuse me. I’m sorry. I need Toby.
9864,toby,Yeah.  Come here a sec.
9865,toby,You’re doing good.  What?
9866,c.j.,I know what the piece of paper is.
9867,toby,What is it?
9868,c.j.,It’s a recon-and-strategy memo that Mandy wrote when she was working for Russell.
9869,toby,Strategy to do what?
9870,c.j.,Beat us in three years.
9871,toby,Did you read it?
9872,c.j.,Yeah.
9873,toby,Is it bad?
9874,c.j.,Yeah.
9875,toby,Let’s go to my office.
9877,josh, How do you know to be standing here?
9879,josh,You don’t have a window.
9881,josh,What are you doing in my office when I’m not there?
9883,josh,Okay.
9885,josh,It went fine.
9887,josh,Yeah.
9889,josh,"I don’t, Donna, and the way that you know that I don’t, is that I’m not."
9891,josh,I’m really not in the mood to mess around.
9893,josh,I need you to get me prepped on something.
9895,josh,English as the national language.
9897,josh,Might come up.
9899,josh,"Because...it doesn’t matter. Because if we do a thing with the F.E.C., opponents will  put English as the national language on the table."
9901,josh,Donna...
9903,josh,Donna!
9905,josh,"Donna, didn’t I just say that I can’t mess around?"
9907,josh,Yes.
9909,josh,Yeah.
9911,josh,Thank you. 
9913,josh,Toby?
9915,toby,"I’m not taking any calls right now, Ginger."
9916,toby,I’ll call him back.
9917,toby, “The reality of the Bartlet White House is a flood of mistakes. An agenda  hopelessly stalled and lacking a coherent strategy. An administration plagued by  indecision...”
9918,toby,Ginger!
9919,josh, What’s going on?
9920,c.j.,"Mandy wrote an instruction manual for Russell, and it’s out there somewhere."
9921,josh,Where?
9922,c.j.,I don’t know yet.
9923,josh,How bad is it?
9924,c.j.,"Well, she takes the three of us to town. We don’t look like rocket scientists. But,  then again, we’re not rocket scientists."
9925,josh,Who is it bad for?
9926,toby,The President... Leo. The President and Leo.
9927,josh,We don’t know who has this?
9928,c.j.,I’m talking to everybody in the room.
9929,josh,Do it quietly.
9930,toby,And quickly. Whose paper will it be in tomorrow? We have to know right away.
9931,c.j.,Yeah.
9932,josh,"Our second year doesn’t seem to be going a whole lot better than our first, does it?"
9933,toby,No.
9934,toby,"Margaret, does he have a minute?"
9935,toby,They almost done?
9936,toby,I’ll wait.
9937,toby,Yeah.
9938,toby,Yeah.
9939,leo,"Thank you, Fitz."
9940,toby,Good afternoon admiral.
9941,leo,"Toby, you here to see me?"
9942,toby,Yeah.
9943,leo,"Fitz, the President’s gonna want to know is the Philippines redundant, that’s all."
9944,leo,"Well, you’re gonna have to convince the President of its beauty."
9945,leo,If you say so.
9946,toby,They’re meeting with Sam on gays in the military.
9947,toby,Sam’s trying to put together a coherent position.
9948,toby,"Yes, sir. By the way, there may be a major security breach with the White House computers."
9949,toby,Well... that explains that.
9950,leo,He wants to put A1/M1s in Manila.
9951,toby,The President’s gonna say it’s redundant.
9952,leo,Yeah.
9953,toby,How much does it cost?
9954,leo,Not much. Twenty billion.
9955,toby,So...there’s gonna be a thing.
9956,leo,About what?
9957,toby,"Mandy wrote an opposition research memo for Russell, and somebody’s got it."
9958,leo,Who?
9959,toby,C.J.’s finding out.
9960,leo,"Well, it’s politics, Toby. She was playing for the other guys."
9961,toby,Yeah... There’s some observations the President’s not gonna be wild about.
9962,leo,I move him to the middle?
9963,toby,"The sense is that his instinct is to be aggressive, and you take him to safe ground."
9964,leo,Okay.
9965,toby,Leo...
9966,leo,Don’t worry about it.
9967,toby,"Hey, look..."
9968,leo,Don’t worry about it.
9969,toby,Want to see a copy?
9970,leo,No.
9971,toby,Okay... Okay. 
9973,josh,Yeah?
9975,josh,Is it good?
9977,josh,James Madison?
9979,josh,I didn’t ask for a damn social studies paper. I-I-
9981,josh,Donna?
9983,josh,No.
9985,josh,"I wasn’t snapping at you. I just, I-I didn’t realize that you also gave me the stuff I  asked for. I thought it was just...you know, I thought you just gave me James Madison."
9987,josh,Thanks.
9988,josh,Hi.
9989,josh,I really don’t know.
9990,josh,The President wants to put two reformers on the F.E.C. Onorato says they’ll retaliate  by opening up English as the national language.
9991,josh,"I’ve been working here 14 months, Mandy. Tell me what else I should know."
9992,josh,Mandy...
9993,josh,"I understand, Mandy."
9994,josh,"You know, today, isn’t really the best day for you to tell me what your job is."
9995,josh,You never heard of a burn bag?
9996,josh,You know who has it?
9997,josh,Then there’s not much you can do for us today.
9998,josh,"Mandy, it’s not gonna happen. Don’t worry about it. It’s not gonna happen. The  President’s not gonna nominate who he wants in the F.E.C."
9999,josh,’Cause it’s not what we do.
10000,josh,Thanks.
10001,josh,It’s everyone that’s feeling this way today?
10003,josh,"Oh, okay. Thanks."
10004,sam,I’m saying-
10005,sam,"This report, by the way-"
10006,sam,I’m saying-
10007,sam,"And a lot of these are not voluntary statements, not by any definition given by any  civilian court in this country. It is not a voluntary statement when it’s given to a  psychotherapist, as in the case of former Marine corporal David Blessing. It is not a  voluntary statement when it’s made into a personal diary, as in the case of former West  Point cadet Nicole Garrison. It is not when it’s made after being asked, as in the case  of master chief officer Diane Kelli. And it is not when it is coerced out of a service  member through fear...through intimidation, through death threats, in terms of criminal  prosecution, as in the case of former Air Force Major Bob Kiddis, former Marine gunnery  sergeant Kevin Keys, and four sailors aboard the U.S.S. Essex."
10008,sam,You’re not taking care of your guys. Your guys are out looking for jobs.
10009,sam,Mr. Chairman.
10010,sam,"Uh, Major Tate, Major Thompson, this is Chairman Fitzwallace."
10011,sam,Oh. Yes sir.
10012,sam,Excuse me.
10013,sam,"Mr. Chairman... Just, thanks for stopping in."
10014,sam,The President just wanted some exploratory meetings.
10015,c.j.,Danny.
10016,c.j.,I was hoping to find you here. I wanted to ask you-
10017,c.j.,I wanted to ask you-
10018,c.j.,"Danny, is it the Magna Carta or-?"
10019,c.j.,Go ahead.
10020,c.j.,"Okay. You’ve heard there’s a piece of paper out there, right?"
10021,c.j.,You know what it is?
10022,c.j.,"That’s right.  You got to know, I don’t want exploiting our friendship in any  way, and I certainly don’t like taking advantage of any feelings beyond friendship you  might have for me."
10023,c.j.,I don’t.
10024,c.j.,I need to be ready for this...Do you know who has it?
10025,c.j.,Who has it?
10026,c.j.,You have it?
10027,c.j.,And you’re gonna write about it?
10028,c.j.,Why?
10029,c.j.,Why?
10030,c.j.,It’s not news.
10031,c.j.,"It’s not news just because it’s entertaining, Danny."
10032,c.j.,Mandy wasn’t working for the President at the time she wrote this memo-
10033,c.j.,Fine.
10034,c.j.,We’ll have a comment for you at the end of the day.
10035,c.j.,None of what is your fault?
10036,c.j.,Okay.
10037,sam,Congressman.
10038,sam,There is no record.
10039,sam,"You know, Ken. There’s something I’d always wanted to ask you. What does being gay mean  you can’t keep your hands to yourself? Over what kind of gentlemanly pride of the Armed  Forces willing to lay claim the restraint in that area? You want me to get the file on  sexual harassment on the D.O.D.? Do you want me to ask these guys about Tailok?"
10040,sam,And I’ve had more than enough of this!
10041,sam,The President’s veracity on this-
10042,sam,No.
10043,sam,No.
10044,toby,I’ll do that.
10045,toby,Get me a muffin. Be careful not to handle it yourself. You want to use gloves. Slip it  to me in a plastic bag. I’ll send it off to the lab.
10046,toby,Yes.
10047,leo,Come in.
10048,leo,Margaret thinks the F.B.I.’s gonna bust in here any minute.
10049,toby,Yeah.
10050,toby,"I got my second bit of bad news for you today, Leo."
10051,leo,You got new numbers?
10052,toby,Yeah.
10053,leo,How bad is it?
10054,toby,CNN/USA Today puts our job approval at 42%.
10055,leo,We dropped five points?
10056,toby,Yeah.
10057,leo,In a week?
10058,toby,His unfavorables are higher than his favorables for the first time. Fifty-four percent  of the country is likely to vote for a Republican Congressional candidate in November.
10059,leo,We dropped five points in a week?
10060,toby,Yeah.
10061,leo,We didn’t do anything last week.
10062,toby,I’ll say.
10063,leo,"Toby, when you start thinking about jumping ship, you’ll let me know, right?"
10064,toby,"One victory in a year, Leo."
10065,leo,Toby-
10066,toby,Mendoza. We got Mendoza on the Court.
10067,leo,"This President was elected with 48% of the vote, Toby."
10068,toby,"Yeah, but he was elected."
10069,leo,Without a mandate. The majority of people in the country voted for somebody else.
10070,toby,"I don’t care, Leo. He was elected. He was sworn in. I was standing ten feet from the  chief justice."
10071,leo,I’m saying it’s not the easiest circumstance on...
10072,toby,Who the hell said it would be easy?
10073,leo,... One victory in a year isn’t so bad!
10074,toby,"One victory in a year stinks in a life of an administration. But it’s not the ones we  lose that bother me, Leo. It’s the ones we don’t suit up for!   And I’m not too crazy about you questioning my loyalty just then."
10075,leo,Yeah?
10076,c.j., Hey.
10077,leo,Oh. Hey C.J.
10078,c.j.,The President’s reading Mandy’s memo. I just gave it to him.
10079,leo,"I wish you hadn’t done that, C.J."
10080,c.j.,Why?
10081,leo,It’s just gonna piss him off.
10082,c.j.,It’s gonna be in the newspapers tomorrow.
10083,leo,Did you find out who has it?
10084,c.j.,Danny.
10085,leo,And he’s writing it?
10086,c.j.,Yeah. It should run right next to the new polling numbers.
10087,josh,How did we drop five points in a week?
10088,leo,It happened. Let’s move on.
10089,josh,"What I think is, the Senate will confirm Bacon and Calhoun. They’ll have to ‘cause  their credentials are too good, and the voters want campaign reform. As a punishment,  they’ll roll out a legislative agenda designed to force the President to come down on  the unpopular side of everything. For instance, they’ll bring out English as the  national language. I believe-"
10090,leo,We’re not gonna let it on the table.
10091,josh,I think we shouldn’t be afraid-
10092,leo,Josh!
10093,josh,"Leo, I think we shouldn’t be afraid to get into it on English as the-"
10094,leo,He’s not gonna let it on the table.
10095,josh,Then we’ll live with their candidates for the F.E.C.
10096,leo,As we always have.
10097,josh,Yes.
10098,leo, What about you?
10099,sam,My meeting?
10100,leo,Yeah.
10101,sam,It was the same meeting we’ve been having for...  It was fine.
10102,leo,Yeah?
10103,leo,Yeah.
10104,bartlet,Who’s got this?
10105,leo,Danny Concannon.
10106,bartlet,Why am I just finding out about this now?
10107,leo,We spent most of the day learning about it ourselves.
10108,bartlet,I really did wake up energized this morning.
10109,leo,I know.
10110,bartlet,I never go to bed that way.
10111,leo,I know.
10112,bartlet,"Just once, in this job, I’d like to end a day feeling as good as I did when the day  started.  Are you bothered by this?"
10113,leo,The memo?
10114,bartlet,Yeah.
10115,leo,Yes.
10116,bartlet,"We’ve heard it all before, Leo. You drive me to political safe ground. It’s not true."
10117,leo,I know it’s not true.
10118,bartlet,Good. 
10119,leo,You drive me there.
10120,bartlet, What the hell did you say?
10121,leo,And you know it too.
10122,bartlet,Leo?
10123,leo,We’re stuck in neutral because that’s where you tell me to stay.
10124,bartlet,You’re wrong.
10125,leo,"No. I’m not, sir."
10126,bartlet,You want to do this now?
10127,leo,Sir?
10128,bartlet,"You came to my house, Leo."
10129,leo,Mr. President?
10130,bartlet,"You came to my house, and you said, “Jed, let’s run for President.” I said, “Why?”  And you said, “So that you can open your mouth and say what you think!” Where’d that  part go, Leo?"
10131,leo,"You tell me, Mr. President. I don’t see a shortage of cameras or microphones around  here. What the hell were you waiting for?"
10132,bartlet,Look...
10133,leo,Everything you do...
10134,bartlet,This morning-
10135,leo,"Everything you do says: “For God’s sakes, Leo. I don’t want to be a one-term President.”"
10136,bartlet,Did I not say put our guys on the F.E.C.?
10137,leo,No sir. You did not do that.
10138,bartlet,Leo!
10139,leo,"You said -- No! You said, let’s dangle our feet in the water of whatever the hell it is  we dangle our feet in, when we want to make it look like we’re trying without pissing  too many people off!"
10140,bartlet,"You’re writing a fascinating version of history, my friend."
10141,leo,"Oh, take a look at Mandy’s memo, Mr. President, and you’ll read a fascinating version  of it."
10142,bartlet,You brought me in on teachers. You brought me in on capital gains. You brought me in  on China. And you brought me in on guns.
10143,leo,"Brought you in from where? You’ve never been out there on guns. You’ve never been out  there on teachers. You dangle your feet, and I’m the hall monitor around here. It’s my  job to make sure nobody runs too fast or goes off too far. I tell Josh to go to the Hill  on campaign finance, he knows nothing’s gonna come out of it."
10144,bartlet,That’s crap.
10145,leo,"Sam can’t get real on Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell because you’re not gonna be there, and every  guy sitting across the room from him knows that."
10146,bartlet,"Leo, if I ever told you to get aggressive about campaign finance or gays in the military,  you would tell me, “Don’t run too fast or go to far.”"
10147,leo,"If you ever told me to get aggressive about anything, I’d say I serve at the pleasure of  the President.  But we’ll never know, sir, because I don’t think you’re ever gonna  say it."
10148,bartlet,"I have said it, and nothing’s every happened!"
10149,leo,You want to see me orchestrate this right now? You want to see me mobilize these people?  These people who would walk into fire if you told them to. These people who showed up to  lead. These people who showed up to fight.  Everyone’s waiting for you. I don’t know how much longer.
10150,bartlet,I don’t want to feel like this anymore.
10151,leo,You don’t have to.
10152,bartlet,I don’t want to go to sleep like this.
10153,leo,You don’t have to.
10154,bartlet,I want to speak.
10155,leo,Say it out loud. Say it to me.
10156,bartlet,This is more important than reelection. I want to speak now.
10157,leo,Say it again.
10158,bartlet,This is more important than reelection. I want to speak now.
10159,leo,Now we’re in business!
10160,bartlet,What’s happening?
10161,leo,"We got our asses kicked in the first quarter, and it’s time we move up the mat. "
10162,bartlet,Yes!
10163,leo,Say it.
10164,bartlet,This is more important than reelection. I want to speak now.
10165,leo, I’m gonna talk to the staff. I’m gonna take them off the leash.
10166,bartlet,You have a strategy for all this?
10167,leo,I have the beginnings of one.
10168,bartlet,What is it?
10169,leo,I’m gonna try that out for a little while.
10170,leo,"Listen up. Our ground game isn’t working. If we want to walk into walls, I’d want us  running into them full speed."
10171,josh,What are you saying?
10172,leo,"Well, you can start by telling the Hill the President has named his nominees for the "
10173,leo,"And we’re gonna lose some of these battles, and we might even lose the White House, but  we’re not gonna be threatened by issues. We’re gonna put them front and center. We’re  gonna raise the level of public debate in this country, and let that be our legacy.  That sound all right to you, Josh?"
10174,josh,I serve at the pleasure of the President of the United States.
10175,leo, Yeah?
10176,c.j.,I serve at the pleasure of the President.
10177,sam,I serve at the pleasure of President Bartlet.
10178,leo,Toby?
10179,toby,I serve at the pleasure of the President.
10180,leo,Good.
10181,leo,Then let’s get in the game!
10182,bartlet,"I get nervous around laws that fundamentally assume that Americans can't be trusted.  We’d better have mandatory sentencing, because judges can't be trusted to disperse  even-handed justice."
10183,bartlet,"We better have term limits, ‘cause voters can't be trusted to recognize corruption."
10184,bartlet,"Oh, and by the way... I say, by the way. When the playing field is leveled and the  process is fair and open, it turns out we have term limits. They're called elections."
10185,c.j.,"As a matter of fact, the President had a bowl of oatmeal this morning. He said it was  something he's always wanted to try.  Folks, listen up. In a moment or two, the President is going to say something that's  sure to get you all shouting my name at once. There'll be a full briefing tonight at  the White House."
10186,c.j.,Yeah. You're not going to want to miss this.
10187,c.j.,The President's going to throw his cap over the wall.
10188,c.j.,You're about to find out.
10189,bartlet,"My father was very fond of the analogy of the Irish lads whose journey was blocked by  a brick wall, seemingly too high to scale. Throwing their caps over the wall, the lads  had no choice but to follow. How many times in the great history of our country have  we come to a wall seemingly too high to scale only to throw our caps to the other side?"
10190,bartlet," Tomorrow... tomorrow morning, we're going to begin to change the way elections  are supervised in this country. "
10191,bartlet, I am proud to nominate John Branford Bacon and Patricia Calhoun to the  Federal Election Commission.
10192,sam,You're about to get a call.
10193,josh,Yeah. 
10194,sam,Big call.
10195,josh,Yeah. 
10196,sam,Powerful guy.
10197,josh,Yeah. 
10198,sam,I'm just saying you're probably rocked back from your meeting last week.
10199,josh,A little.
10200,sam,They threatened you with a legislative agenda.
10201,josh,Yeah. 
10202,sam,They made you feel powerless and you're a little off your game.
10203,josh,Yeah. 
10204,sam,A little gun shy.
10205,toby,Leave him alone.
10206,sam,I'm bucking him up.
10207,toby,Leave him alone.
10208,sam,You asked me to buck him up.
10209,toby,"Now, I'm telling you to leave him alone."
10210,josh,"Guys, I'm trying to watch this speech."
10212,josh,The call?
10214,toby,"Josh, if you need us, we're standing right here."
10215,josh," Hi, Senator. Why don't you take your legislative agenda and shove it up  your ass. "
10216,josh,Turns out I was fine.
10217,c.j.,"I'd like to emphasize again that the President has nominated one Democrat and one  Republican, which he was, certainly, under no legal obligation to do. "
10218,c.j.,Jesse. 
10219,c.j.,"In the past, the F.E.C. Commissioners has been chosen by the President, signing off on  whomever the Congressional Leadership pointed to."
10220,c.j.,I think it's possible we forgot to tell them.
10221,josh,Say it's a police action.
10222,c.j.," The President isn't empowered to declare war. The President is empowered.  In fact, he's obligated to nominate Federal Agency Directors. I call it more of a  police action. "
10223,josh, How 'bout that?
10225,josh,On the phone?
10227,josh,Do you know why?
10229,josh,He's bringing in Al Kiefer?
10231,josh,Why can't you tell me?
10233,josh, Fine.
10235,josh,Yeah. 
10237,josh,"It's a big polling week, Donna. I figured he was bringing in Kiefer."
10239,josh,That's what you were afraid to tell me?
10241,josh,Okay. 
10243,josh,"That's a good idea, cause... wait... "
10245,josh,Joey Lucas.
10247,josh,Okay... okay....
10249,josh,You... you shouldn't have been. You know why?
10251,josh,It's no big deal. And I'll tell you what else.
10253,josh,I... I am a pro. But that's not what I was going to say.
10255,josh,That's what I was going to say.
10257,josh,"But, both those things are true. I'm a pro and what was the other one?"
10259,josh,That's right.
10260,josh,You talking to me?
10261,josh,"That's how we do things in New England, my friends. "
10262,josh,Where's Toby?
10263,josh,Hey. 
10264,toby, That's good... good... Okay... Sam?
10265,sam,Yeah. 
10266,toby,"You're going to come to a verb soon, right?"
10267,sam,Okay. You know what this is called?
10268,toby,Bad writing?
10269,sam,Imagery.
10270,toby,"Well, you say potato... Josh, it's a big polling week. I'm bringing in Al Kiefer. "
10271,josh,You've turned 180 degrees on Kiefer. You know that?
10272,toby,I haven't turned on Kiefer at all. I don't want him advising the President. I want him  bringing us numbers.
10273,josh,Advising people is what pollsters do.
10274,toby,He'll do what I tell him to do. Also....
10275,josh,English as the National Language.
10276,sam,"That's the first thing they're going to fight back with, Josh. "
10277,toby,We need Hispanics. You know what state has a large population of Hispanics?
10278,josh,"Uh... I want to say Maine, but uh... "
10279,toby,California.
10280,josh,"California. Damn, and I was only off by a continent."
10281,toby,Josh. 
10282,josh,It's fine. Bring her out here.
10283,toby,She'll be here tomorrow.
10284,josh,This isn't a thing. 
10285,toby,Okay. 
10286,josh,"I met her twice, Toby."
10287,sam,"Yeah, but, one of those times, she broke your heart. You know the way women can do.  Where they take your heart and they throw it on the floor and then they stomp on it  with their big high heals. She’s a very beautiful and interesting woman. I can see why  a lot of guys would go for her.  You know, there's nothing at all I'm saying now  of any value. So, I think the thing to do is... I think I should just keep writing."
10288,josh,Okay.  We had a good night.
10289,toby,Yeah. 
10290,josh, C.J.'s doing great in there.
10291,toby,"Any time you want to use punctuation, that'd be fine."
10292,c.j.,I'm going to take one more question. Katie.
10293,c.j.,"I wouldn't say the F.E.C. was merely symbolic, but if you're suggesting they're  toothless, I'll agree with you."
10294,c.j.,No. 
10295,c.j.,Symbolism. There'll be plenty more tomorrow. Everybody have a good night.
10296,c.j.,Carol. 
10297,sam,Mandatory Minimums are racist.
10298,toby,I understand that.
10299,sam,They're a red herring.
10300,toby,"I understand that, too."
10301,sam,"It's a way of looking like you're tough on crime, without assuming the burden of being  tough on crime."
10302,toby,Everything you've said I understand.
10303,sam,I'm saying...
10304,toby,We do things one thing at a time.
10305,sam,But I'm saying we don't have time to do things one thing at a time. 
10306,toby,We're talking about treatment.
10307,sam,I'm talking about treatment and I'm talking about Mandatory Minimums and I'm saying it's  a red herring and I'm saying it's racist.
10308,toby,"When you talk to the President, I want you talking about treatment. I want you talking  about treatment vs. enforcement and I don't want you to stray from that!"
10309,sam,"Toby, is this what you meant when you said, ""Sam, you're completely in charge of this""?"
10310,toby,"Yes, I meant, you're in charge of this, in the sense that you're subordinate to me in  every way.  Where is this place?"
10311,sam,What place?
10312,toby,The breakfast place.
10313,sam,It's still on the last street.
10314,toby,Why didn't you say anything?
10315,sam,We were having a nice conversation.
10316,leo,"Thanks, Celia."
10317,leo,All set there?
10318,josh,Leo. We couldn't meet closer to the office?
10319,leo,I don't want people coming by the table.
10320,josh,We couldn't meet in the office?
10321,leo,I was hungry.
10322,josh,We couldn't have food ordered?
10323,leo,"Oh, sit down, would you?"
10325,josh,Donna. 
10327,josh,Donna. 
10329,josh,We need a California expert and this is my regular Tuesday suit.
10330,josh,I'm saying there's no particular M.O. behind...
10331,sam,Found it.
10332,leo,About time. Sit down.
10333,sam,"Ah, Leo...."
10334,leo,Hang on.  Talk to me about drugs.
10335,toby,We can make a case for treatment vs. enforcement and we're ready to go to the President.
10336,sam,We're also ready to go to the President with Mandatory Minimums on crack versus powder  cocaine. 
10337,leo,One step at a time.
10338,sam,That's what Toby just said.
10339,leo,Toby’s right.
10340,sam,"Yes, but does anyone remember that I was put in charge."
10341,leo,"It was an honorary kind of thing, Sam."
10342,leo, Yeah.
10343,leo, Thank you.
10344,toby,What was that?
10345,leo,You know what that was.
10346,leo,Hold on to them until I say so.
10347,toby,It's exactly the right thing to do.
10348,leo,From anybody but me.
10349,josh,I'd like to clear up that I... I don't have suits for the days of the week. This is  just a regular suit. 
10350,sam,It's a nice suit.
10352,josh,Donna! 
10354,leo," I am beginning to regret having hired any of you. We have a 42% job  approval and you're talking about waffles and something with Josh, I don't understand."
10356,leo,You got dressed up for a guy named Joey?
10357,josh,Joey... Joey Lucas is a woman... and I'm not getting dressed up for her.
10359,leo,My point is... we have to make it through the week without making any mistakes.
10360,josh,We will.
10361,leo,I'm saying that this is...
10362,josh,I'm saying calm down.
10363,leo,I'm perfectly calm.
10364,sam,"You're not calm, Leo. You're acting like a nervous hooleelia."
10365,toby,A what?
10366,sam,It may not be a word. It may just be something my mother used to say.
10367,bartlet,Al... 
10368,sam,Al's Mr. Good News Happy Guy. 
10369,sam,We're not coming out for legalization.
10370,c.j.,Mandy. 
10371,c.j.,Listen... 
10372,c.j.,No. 
10373,c.j.,Leo’s not comfortable with it.
10374,c.j.,No. 
10375,c.j.,You can't.
10376,c.j.,You can't.
10377,c.j.,It wasn't just a memo.
10378,c.j.,Do you have any idea how pissed people are at you? 
10379,c.j.,"They're pissed at me, that's how pissed they are at you. They want to know how the hell  I didn't know about the memo."
10380,c.j.,We'll see. There's plenty for you to do. Leo would feel more comfortable if you stayed  out of this...
10381,sam,Drug control...
10382,sam,Listen to me...
10383,toby,Listen to Sam.
10384,sam,Drug control appropriations...
10385,josh,...which total 17.6 billion...
10386,sam,"...are divided into a ratio of 2/3 enforcement, 1/3 treatment. We want to reverse that  ratio."
10387,sam,So that we can spend more money on treatment.
10388,sam,Al... 
10389,bartlet,"We don't care do we, Sam?"
10390,sam,"No, sir."
10391,leo, What'd I miss?
10392,bartlet,"Kiefer's been here 45 minutes, he's already got me on the playground at recess."
10393,leo, Took you 45 minutes?
10394,toby,"Mr. President, Sam and I have been working with the Office of National Drug Control  Policy, we have some numbers you should hear."
10395,josh,What's up?
10396,josh,Okay. 
10397,josh,What are you smiling at?
10398,josh,Yes. 
10399,josh,Help me out with what?
10400,josh,Stop saying that!
10401,josh,By helping me out?
10402,josh,What makes you think I need any help?
10403,josh,Get away from me.
10404,josh,"Hey, Joey. Hey, Kenny. Good to see you. I got your desks set up out here. Why don't you  come with me? "
10405,josh,Yeah. 
10406,josh,"Joey, we're in a bit of a mode here and I think it's best if we just do business. Plus,  this is the White House. I wouldn't expect candy and flowers on your arrival."
10407,josh, Go back to your office.
10408,josh,"This is your desk. You got a phone. You got a computer. You got access to a staff.  I know how women like to personalize their desks with flowers, and plants, and hand  lotion, but I prefer the place to be professional."
10409,josh,"Some of them might, and I'm saying we don't do that on my side of the building.   I'm going to go back to this meeting and then I'll brief you on what I need."
10410,josh,Come here. 
10411,josh,Yes! 
10412,josh,By coming here! 
10413,josh,This is a place where solemn work is done. This is a place... this is a place... let me  say this... this is not a place where one's personal things... where things among people...  this is not a place... let's... This is a place where work is done and nothing else.
10414,josh,Okay. 
10415,josh, I'll... I'll be back.
10416,c.j.,"Josh, listen. I misspoke last night. I said the President nominated a Democrat and a  Republican, even though he was under no legal obligation to do so. It turns out he is."
10417,josh, C.J....
10418,c.j.,I know.
10419,josh,This from the White House counsel?
10420,c.j.,Yeah. 
10421,josh,You sure?
10422,c.j.,About what?
10423,josh,You said he nominated a Democrat and a Republican.
10424,c.j.,"Even though he was under no legal obligation to do so. Yeah, I just looked at the  transcript."
10425,josh,All right. You'll fix it at the briefing?
10426,c.j.,Yeah. 
10427,josh,Don't worry about it. 
10428,sam,The American Medical Association says that addiction is a disease.
10429,sam,Al! 
10430,toby,"The A.M.A. says it, why does it he have to sell it?"
10431,toby,Drug addiction is a disease. It's a... it's... it's a... medical problem. It can be  treated. This isn't ideological. It's science.
10432,toby," Science is science to everybody, Al."
10433,josh, What'd I miss?
10434,bartlet,Toby was just explaining to Al that science is science to everyone.
10435,josh,"I'm sorry, Mr. President. While Al tries to come up with something easier to sell than  science, would you mind if I spoke to Toby and Leo alone?"
10436,bartlet,Go. 
10437,josh,So... 
10438,leo,Yeah. 
10439,josh,"Hey, Joey Lucas says she's not with Kiefer anymore."
10440,leo,Well that's a load off our minds.
10441,josh,"Yeah... uh... C.J. misspoke last night during her briefing... uh, she'll fix it when  she gets back in there. "
10442,toby,What did she say?
10443,josh,She said the President nominated a Democrat and a Republican when he was under no legal  obligation to do so.
10444,leo,He is under a legal obligation.
10445,josh,She knows that now.
10446,leo,This is just the kind of dumb mistake we don't need right now. 
10447,josh,"She knows that, too."
10448,leo,"All right, what are you gonna do?"
10449,josh,How's it going in there?
10450,leo,Sam’s just starting.
10451,josh,"You talked to him about the thing, yet?  "
10452,leo,No. 
10453,toby,Me? 
10454,leo,"Yeah, listen...."
10455,josh,We want you to go to a meeting.
10456,toby,With who?
10457,josh,"A prominent House Democrat who has a voice on Campaign Finance Reform and if it was  someone on the Ethics Committee that'd be even better, cause then she could answer some  of Leo’s questions."
10458,toby, I used to be married to someone who fits that description.
10459,leo,I set up lunch for the two of you.
10460,toby,You set me up on a date with my ex-wife?
10461,leo,Yeah. Let her know the President's not going to ask the democrats to unilaterally drop  soft money.
10462,josh,Make that clear.
10463,leo,And also take her temperature on the ethics thing.
10464,toby,Okay.
10465,josh,"See ya later.  Leo, you had to send flowers?"
10466,leo,It's a nice thing to do.
10467,josh,"Yeah, but I had this whole patter thing going... and then... the hell with it. "
10468,leo,Margaret!
10469,leo,The list of names I gave you before?
10470,leo,You didn't have to memorize them.
10471,leo,Okay. 
10472,leo,"Yes, call their offices. I want to see one representative apiece at two o'clock. I want  them as a group. "
10473,leo,In the press briefing room. 
10474,leo,Yeah. 
10475,leo,Don't worry about it.
10476,josh,Hello. 
10477,josh,I see you're all settled in.
10478,josh,"Area looks good. Not too many personal items. Got your little clock, that's fine."
10479,josh,"Here's the story. The President announced last night, he's naming two Campaign Finance  Reform minded nominees to the F.E.C. This will anger the Republican Leadership to the  extent they'll retaliate. Retaliate, how? They'll introduce a series of bills design to  put the President on the wrong side of public debates. The first will be a law making  English the National language."
10480,josh,Joey... 
10481,sam,Over 30% of the entire Federal prison population are non-violent first time offenders  in jail for drug related crimes.
10482,sam,"At a cost, for those prisoners alone..."
10483,sam,...of 2 million dollars a day.
10484,toby,"Mr. President, we can sell the public on the idea that 2 million bucks a day can be put  to better use."
10485,sam,"Yes, if it's for treatment. Yes, we can demonstrate that treatment is what prevents  substance abuse."
10486,sam,The A.M.A....
10487,bartlet,Can't sell science?
10488,bartlet,I'm hungry and so far nobody has convinced me of anything.
10489,leo,Let's go eat lunch and meet back here in an hour.
10490,sam,"Yes, sir."
10491,sam,"Uh, we're in the early stages."
10492,sam,That's an interesting question.
10493,sam,I could have turkey.
10494,sam,I could have some fish.
10495,sam,"A nice piece of fish never hurt anyone, Cathy."
10496,sam,Steve. 
10497,sam,Yes. This is about the F.E.C. nominees?
10498,sam,"You don't want to see me, you want to see Josh."
10499,sam,"On the F.E.C., Josh is the guy."
10500,sam,Steve. 
10501,sam,That sounds exactly like Josh to me.
10502,sam,"Then your boss will be arrested, as I'm quite sure that's against the law."
10503,sam,"And I'm tired, and this isn't my thing. Go see Josh."
10504,sam,What? 
10505,sam,"Yeah, but at my desk, I was just gonna get..."
10506,sam,Turkey. 
10507,toby,Yes. 
10508,toby,"There are restaurants, you know, indoors, with waiters and tables."
10509,toby,I'm wearing a suit.
10510,toby,I'm a responsible adult.
10511,toby,I rest my case.
10512,toby,What? 
10513,toby,Andy. 
10514,toby,You baked a pie?
10515,toby,Let's go. 
10516,toby,And you trust it?
10517,toby,Andy. 
10518,toby,The President's not gonna ask anyone to give up soft money unilaterally.
10519,toby,Yeah. 
10520,toby,Ritchie.
10521,toby,But we have your people in line?
10522,toby,What about drugs?
10523,toby,Andy... 
10524,toby,One step at a time.
10525,toby,Treatment.
10526,toby,I know what you're saying. I don't want to talk about Mandatory Minimums.
10527,toby,"Andy, I don't want to..."
10528,toby,"This is what happens. This is what you do. I say I don't want to talk about Mandatory  Minimums and we talk about Mandatory Minimums anyway. You hijack my ability to make that  decision for myself, Andrea. And making decisions for myself is my birthright!"
10529,toby,Yes. 
10530,toby,You don't have a problem with what Leo’s gonna do?
10531,toby,Why? 
10532,toby,"It's not fun, Andy."
10533,toby,It's not fun...
10534,toby,Not everything is fun....
10535,toby,"If you want to be there, you can be there, but this is a serious thing."
10536,toby,Andy. 
10537,toby,"Can you walk faster, please? I really don't like to be outdoors this long."
10538,sam, Yeah.
10539,sam,They're too qualified?
10540,sam,That's a problem.
10541,sam,I understood what you're saying.
10542,sam,"Steve, the F.E.C. nominees aren't my thing."
10543,sam,We've been gearing up for 14 months.
10544,sam,Yeah. 
10545,sam,Important to everyone.
10546,sam,Yeah. 
10547,sam,It's gonna get me somewhere and I'm not trading it in.
10548,sam,We're not bartering.
10549,sam,And with the nominations?
10550,sam, Cookies.
10551,sam," Girl Scouts sells cookies, not cupcakes. And it was a  pretty good speech, I wrote. It was about volunteerism. "
10552,sam, I will. 
10553,c.j.,Leo.
10554,leo,Yeah. 
10555,c.j.,I was just coming to see you.
10556,leo,I don't have much time.
10557,c.j.,You're people are here. They're in the press briefing room.
10558,leo,Okay. 
10559,c.j.,Carol’s keeping the press in the northeast lobby. She'll wait for your high sign.
10560,leo,I'll be over in a minute.
10561,c.j.,We're telling anyone who asks why the press is out of there that it's a special event.
10562,leo,Good. 
10563,c.j.,"Leo, I don't know if you've heard..."
10564,leo,"Yeah, I did hear C.J. You want me to tell you how many different ways that screw-up was  stupid?"
10565,c.j.,I know.
10566,leo,"For one thing, don't pass yourself off as a legal authority. For another, what the hell  are you doing using a phrase like ""under no legal obligation""?"
10567,c.j.,Leo. 
10568,leo,You're parsing at a time when the whole idea...
10569,c.j.,I know. 
10570,leo,"So right out of the gate, we've got to go back."
10571,c.j.,Yes. 
10572,leo,"These amateur mistakes make me crazy, C.J."
10573,c.j.,Yes. 
10574,leo,I'll be in there in a minute. 
10575,c.j.,We'll talk in my office.
10576,c.j.,There's a meeting in there.
10577,c.j.,None of your business.
10578,c.j.,"Hi, Carol."
10579,c.j.,Don't talk to me like that in front of people.
10580,c.j.,No! I just got called amateur twice in 10 seconds. The White House Chief of Staff can do  it to me wherever he wants. You don't do it in front of people.
10581,c.j.,I would think a man with your credentials...
10582,c.j., You think I am?!
10583,c.j.,Says you.
10584,c.j.,"Congratulations, you're a movie star. You're also on the outside looking in for a while,  so get used to it."
10585,c.j.,DON’T tell me what I don't understand! I'm not in my freshman year anymore. I understand  more than you think.
10586,c.j.,Yeah. 
10587,c.j.,Thanks. 
10588,c.j.,Special event.
10589,leo,Good afternoon. I'll make this as quick and direct as I can. There's a chance...
10590,leo,"This will be pretty fast, Stuart. Faster still if I'm not interrupted. There's a chance  that a debate is about to begin over the best way to fight the drug problem in this  country. The White House, being among those, who believe more money should be put into  treatment. The people you work for, being among those who believe we should put more  money into prisons. "
10591,leo,"Dick, in July of '96, your boss's son was arrested for carrying 25 grams of cocaine.  That's a crime that usually carries... what Toby?"
10592,toby,Eight to 15 years.
10593,leo,And what did the Congressman's son get?
10594,toby,Six months house arrest.
10595,leo,"Lynn, your boss's husband was caught stealing Vicodin and Percocet from the hospital at  which he served as Chief of Thoracic Surgery. Now, Vicodin and Percocet are schedule-two  drugs in the same legal category as Opium. What was the blue-book value, Toby?"
10596,toby,Each stolen pill carries the penalty of one year in prison and a monetary fine.
10597,leo,And what did we have for the Congresswoman's husband?
10598,toby,He went to a pre-trial diversion program. There's no longer any criminal record.
10599,leo,That's not bad.
10600,leo,"Stuart, yours is my favorite. Your boss has a daughter who was pulled over with 31 grams  of coke and charged with intent to deliver. More over, she's just been indicted by a  federal grand jury in Greenville, South Carolina, along with 18 other people for  conspiracy to distribute. Toby..."
10601,toby,She paid a fine of $2800 and forfeited her car in which the drugs were found.
10602,leo,The President wants a lively debate. 
10603,leo,"He wants to hear opposition, but he's not gonna stomach hypocrisy. We start hearing  ""soft on criminals"", ""soft on drugs"" from any of the people you work for, we've got 7  stories ready for page one. "
10604,leo,Here comes the White House Press Corps. Let's find out.
10605,leo,"You play the full nine innings at this level, Stuart. Tell your friends about it."
10606,toby,Listen.
10607,toby,Andy. 
10608,toby,That was not fun.
10609,toby,"I have to get back to work. And you, being a Congresswoman... I'm sure you need to be  back out there... you know, screwing the people."
10610,toby,What? 
10611,toby,What? 
10612,toby,That's fine.
10613,toby,"You didn't say, ""Officer, I'm a member of Congress, isn't there anything we can do  about this?"""
10614,toby,Who were you out with?
10615,toby,Executive advisor for the Orioles?
10616,toby,You went out on a date with the executive advisor for the Baltimore Orioles?
10617,toby,"Honest to God, I'm not sure."
10618,toby,What are you doing getting into cars with guys that have been drinking?
10619,toby,That's what taxicabs are for.
10620,toby,"And also, I can still do that."
10621,toby,"If it wasn't an Oriole, absolutely. Or a Red Sock. In fact, just date the National  League, would you? "
10622,toby,Go away.
10623,toby,Andy? 
10624,toby,Let me have the pie.
10625,leo,Mr. President.
10626,bartlet, Yeah.
10627,leo,"Oh, you're in bed?"
10628,bartlet,Yeah. 
10629,leo,"When I called, you were awake."
10630,bartlet,"Well, yeah, that's cause I answered the phone. "
10631,leo,I was just coming by to talk. It can wait.
10632,bartlet,What's on your mind? 
10633,leo,You sure?
10634,bartlet,"Yeah, I got to be up in four hours, anyway."
10635,josh,Hey. 
10636,josh,F.E.C. Where's the President?
10637,josh,She's still here?
10638,josh,Why are you telling me?
10639,josh,Charlie.
10640,josh,Have a good night.
10641,josh,Yeah. 
10642,josh, See you tomorrow.
10643,sam,"Hey, Charlie."
10644,toby, Tell him what you told me.
10645,sam,See... uh... I still don't understand.
10646,toby,Tell him what you told me.
10647,sam,Steve Onorato came to see me this afternoon. We had lunch.
10648,josh,Onorato came to you?
10649,sam,Yeah. 
10650,toby,Tell him what he said.
10651,sam,"He said that if we dropped F.E.C., he could warm things up for drugs. "
10652,sam,I don't understand.
10653,josh,He said that?
10654,toby,He even pointed out to Sam that Sam was working on drugs for the White House.
10655,josh," You made the big time, Sam."
10656,sam,What's going on?
10657,josh,He knows about Laurie.
10658,sam,What do you mean?
10659,toby,He knows you’re friends with a call girl.
10660,sam,What does that have to do with anything?
10661,josh,He wants to move you out to the front of the field so he can drop Laurie on you.
10662,sam,Are you serious?
10663,josh,Yeah. 
10664,sam,Are you serious?!
10665,josh,"It's okay, Sam. You haven't done anything wrong."
10666,sam,"Oh, I know I haven't done anything wrong. Are you serious? "
10667,toby, We're serious. Don't worry about it.
10668,sam,"He... are you saying, he... he tried to practice on my... "
10669,toby,...credulous simplicity?
10670,sam,Yeah. 
10671,toby,Yeah. 
10672,sam,Alright. I want to know what I can do right now.
10673,josh,Sam. 
10674,sam,"No, right now! At 11:35. I want to know what I can do."
10675,josh,Take it easy.
10676,sam,I won’t take it easy! Give me the phone.  I'm gonna call the  Senator and I'm gonna tell him that he can shove his legislative agenda up his ass!
10677,josh,I've already done that.
10678,sam,I'll do it again.
10679,josh,"You know what this is like? This is like The Godfather. When Pacino tells James Caan  that he's gonna kill the cop. It's a lot like that scene, only not really."
10680,toby,Did Leo go home?
10681,josh,He's... he's still here somewhere.
10682,sam,He's in the Residence.
10683,josh,It is like that scene. I'm James Caan.  You're...you're Al Pacino.
10684,toby,Let's go.
10685,josh,"Toby, you're the guy who shows Pacino how to make tomato sauce. "
10686,toby, Let's go.
10687,josh,"I'll be right behind, I'm gonna pick up the late wires."
10688,josh,Hello. 
10689,josh,"Hey, Kenny."
10690,josh,I saw the light was on. You guys are here late.
10691,josh,I brought you a coffee mug.
10692,josh,"Just as a thing, cause you don't know anybody. It's got... uh... a picture of the White  House. It says, “The White House.” Seal of the President. It's a White House coffee mug."
10693,josh,"Kenny, can you give us a second?"
10694,josh,"I wore this suit, special today. This isn't my regular Tuesday suit."
10695,josh,No. 
10696,josh,"Yeah... So... Okay, I gotta go. "
10697,leo,"So... I don't want to be Labor the point, though. I... I do think this is understandable.  I feel a little self-conscience coming down the mountain on drugs two months after I  announce I was a recovering drug addict. What do you think?"
10698,bartlet,About what?
10699,leo,What I just said.
10700,bartlet,"Well, I wasn't listening to a lot of it."
10701,leo,Sir... 
10702,bartlet,"Leo, if there's anyone qualified to talk about the benefits of treatment vs. criminal  action, it's you. Is there anyone whose life would be better right now, if you'd had  gone to jail instead of rehab?"
10703,leo,No. 
10704,bartlet,Thank you. Is there anything else?
10705,bartlet,Apparently there is.
10706,c.j., Mr. President. 
10707,bartlet,Yeah. 
10708,c.j.,"I'm sorry. I heard Leo was here, I assumed you were awake. "
10709,bartlet,I am. 
10710,c.j.,"I haven't seen you all day, I just... wanted to apologize for the gaffe at the briefing  last night."
10711,bartlet,"You fixed it this afternoon, right?"
10712,c.j.,Yeah. 
10713,bartlet,Then let's move on.
10714,c.j.,"I do apologize, sir."
10715,bartlet,"No need to apologize, but I accept your apology and now I'm ready, if not eager, to  move on."
10716,sam,Mr. President?
10717,bartlet,How you doin’?
10718,sam,You were sleeping?
10719,bartlet,Not for a little while now.
10720,sam,"This is... I say, this is great, Mr. President, because usually you have a hard time  getting to sleep before one or two. "
10721,bartlet,Not tonight.
10722,sam,That's got to feel good.
10723,bartlet,"Guys, let me tell you what I would like to have happen, right now."
10724,josh," Good evening, Mr. President."
10725,bartlet,Josh walking in the door wasn't even close. 
10726,josh,"How you doing, tonight?"
10727,bartlet,"I'm fine, thanks. How you doing?"
10728,josh,Good! I gave Joey Lucas a coffee mug. She doesn't know anybody here and she's already  working hard. She's very committed. I think I did the right thing.
10729,bartlet,"See, the part I don't understand is, I got like, 24 armed guards right outside my  bedroom door..."
10730,sam,"Mr. President, after a day of meetings, are you any closer to a decision on drugs?"
10731,bartlet,"I'm a day closer. There'll be more meetings tomorrow. In the meantime, everybody calm  down. Leo’s got your engines fired like you're running Daytona. That's fine. Keep them  there. Guess what? Mistakes are gonna be made. Minimize them, fix them, move on. Kiefer's  numbers got you scared? Listen to me. I have never lost an election in my life. We do  this right, people are going to respond. You all had a good day. "
10732,josh,We should go and leave you now.
10733,bartlet,You guys should feel free to do this when my wife is here.
10734,sam,"Sir, something has come up and frankly, it's got me as hot as a pistol. Apparently...."
10735,josh,Sam. 
10736,sam,We can talk about this tomorrow.
10737,bartlet,Everybody. Mandy was doing her job. It's time to let her out of the doghouse.
10738,leo,That's me.
10739,bartlet, She was doing her job. C.J.?
10740,c.j.,"Yes, sir."
10741,bartlet,So was Danny.
10742,c.j.,"Yes, sir."
10743,bartlet,Good night.
10744,toby,Mr. President.
10745,bartlet,We were almost done.
10746,toby,I... met with Congresswoman Wyatt today.
10747,bartlet,"When you were married to her, did you call her Congresswoman Wyatt?"
10748,toby,"No, sir."
10749,bartlet,"Sometimes I call my wife, Dr. Bartlet."
10750,toby,I call her Andy or uh... Andrea.
10751,bartlet,Okay. 
10752,toby,Mandatory Minimums.
10753,bartlet,"You're whupped, my friend."
10754,toby,Sir. 
10755,bartlet,"No, she's been talking to your for a year about Mandatory Minimums. You've been saying  no. Looks like we know who wears the pants in the Ziegler family."
10756,toby,You call your wife “Dr. Bartlet”?
10757,bartlet,Just for the turn-on.
10758,toby,"Uh... the thing is, she's right."
10759,bartlet,Andy. 
10760,toby,Mandatory Minimums are considerably higher for crack than for powder cocaine.
10761,bartlet,Yes. 
10762,toby,The vast majority of crack users are black. The vast majority of drug users are white.  The Mandatory Minimums are racist. 
10763,bartlet,"Yes, they are."
10764,toby,It should be part of the discussion.
10765,bartlet,And it will be.
10766,toby,Good... uh... good night.
10767,bartlet," When I sleep, I dream about a great discussion  with experts and ideas and diction and energy and honesty. And when I wake up, I think,  ""I can sell that."""
10768,leo,"Good night, Mr. President."
10769,bartlet,Good night.
10771,josh,It’s ten to seven.
10773,josh,It’s 7:05?
10775,josh,That’s ridiculous.
10777,josh,My watch says ten to seven.
10779,josh,My watch is fine.
10781,josh,How do I know it isn’t ten to seven?
10783,toby,Question six is asymmetrical.
10784,c.j.,Question six is fine.
10785,toby,"""Would you say things in this country are going in the right direction or do you think  they’ve gotten off on the wrong track?"""
10786,josh,He’s got a good point about this.
10787,c.j.,"No, he doesn’t."
10789,toby,Should be right direction or wrong direction.
10790,c.j.,Toby. 
10791,toby,Direction and track are two different words!
10792,c.j.,"Thank you, Funk and Wagnall’s. "
10793,toby,What’d she call me?
10794,toby,I know who Funk and Wagnall’s are.
10796,toby,The question is asymmetrical.
10797,c.j.,"That may be so, but the question originated 2 decades ago and has proven to be a  consistent predictor of a voter’s potential behavior. So it stays the way it is. "
10798,josh,I have a problem with fourteen.
10799,c.j.,What’s your problem?
10800,josh,"""When making policy decisions, do you think that President Bartlet puts the needs of  average people first?"" ""Average people"" is a pejorative phrase and occurs about six  times in the polling model. "
10801,c.j.,"This may come as a shock to you, but 80% of the people in this country would use the  word ""average"" to describe themselves. They do not find the term deprecating. Indeed,  being considered an ""average American"" is something they find to be positive and  comforting."
10802,c.j.,Yes. 
10803,leo," ""Jed Bartlet cares about people like me."""
10804,c.j.,"Leo, we went over this."
10805,toby,We need to talk about the asymmetry of question six.
10806,c.j.,We really don’t.
10807,toby,Since when are you an expert on language?
10808,c.j.,In polling models?
10809,toby,Okay. 
10810,c.j.,1993. Since when are you an uptight pain in the ass?
10811,toby,Since long before that.
10812,leo,"""Jed Bartlet cares about people like me. Agree or disagree?"""
10813,c.j.,"Again, we went over this."
10814,leo,"Can’t ""people like me"", when read off the script, be taken to mean people like the  interviewer? "
10815,leo,Fellas. 
10816,leo,But the point is....
10817,c.j.,"The respondent isn’t confused by the question and separating the respondent from the  interviewer with ""people like yourself"" is pejorative. So, Ed, Larry, you can take this  up with Josh. Leo, Eastern Standard Time is sitting down to dinner. The poll is fine. "
10818,josh,"It’s an important poll, C.J."
10819,c.j.,"I’m aware of its importance. I’m also aware that if we don’t start the phone banks  right now, I might not have enough time to leak the internals to media outlets before  we hit the weekend."
10820,toby,There’s still the matter...
10821,c.j.,"So, it turns out that over the last 3 weeks we managed to climb out of the hole, only  we can’t tell anybody about it ‘til Monday, cause we stood here all night arguing about  asymmetry!  It’s time."
10822,leo,Anybody want to make a prediction?
10823,josh,I’ll be happy if we hold steady.
10824,toby,"We’ll drop a few points, but it’ll be inside the plus or minus. "
10825,c.j.,We’re going to go up five points.
10826,leo,The President thinks we’re going to hold steady.
10827,c.j.,The President is wrong.
10828,leo,You think?
10829,c.j.,Yes. 
10830,leo,"Let’s find out. Toby, tell Sam to start the banks."
10831,sam, Let’s get our report card.
10832,sam,"Hey, Ginger."
10833,sam,I popped Mandy with my tranquilizer gun. She’s doing fine.
10834,sam,We need 1500 responses.
10835,sam,"It takes them about 12 hours to make 1500 calls. We need 1500 responses, which means  we need to make 6000 calls. "
10836,toby, Sam. 
10837,sam,Yeah. 
10838,sam,That’s if you’re lucky.
10839,toby,The G.W. Law School graduation is tomorrow.
10840,sam,Yeah. 
10841,toby,Were you going to go see your friend?
10842,sam,Laurie? 
10843,toby,Yeah. 
10844,sam,I wish you’d call her Laurie.
10845,toby,Were you going to see her graduate Law School tomorrow?
10846,sam,Yeah. 
10847,toby,You can’t.
10848,sam,Okay. 
10849,toby,I really do believe Steve Onorato knows and he’s...
10850,sam,Yeah. 
10851,toby,He’ll try and use it to embarrass us.
10852,sam,Okay. 
10853,toby,They may know who this girl is. They know she’s graduating Law School tomorrow. They know  it’s someplace you’ll likely to be. Maybe they’ll want to snap a picture. Maybe...
10854,sam,Laurie. 
10855,toby,What? 
10856,sam,"You called her ""this girl."""
10857,toby,"Sam, you can’t."
10858,sam,"I said okay, Toby. Do you see me arguing with you?"
10859,toby,No. 
10860,sam,Anything else?
10861,toby,Nope. 
10862,sam,Biggest day of her life. Huge day. She put herself through Law School and I know that  there are people in South Carolina that don’t like how she did it.
10863,toby,"Not just South Carolina, Sam."
10864,sam,"Then in both Carolinas, Toby. Though, I never understood what the hell business it is..."
10865,toby,"You can’t go, Sam."
10866,sam,I’m not going.
10867,toby,Thank you.
10868,leo,Is he here?
10869,leo,"Wait in here for a minute, then go back out and send him in."
10870,leo,Cause I do.
10871,leo,Yeah. 
10872,leo,Okay! Go out and send him in.
10873,leo,Barry. 
10874,leo,Leo McGarry.
10875,leo,Good to meet you.
10876,leo,Is this your first time in the White House?
10877,leo,You’ve been on the Federal Election Commission for nine years and no one has ever invited  you to the White House?
10878,leo,Barry. 
10879,leo,I wanted to talk to you about Campaign Finance Reform and specifically soft money  contributions.
10880,leo,Are you thirsty?
10881,leo,You’re a little nervous.
10882,leo,Rodney. 
10883,leo,Rodney’s great.  Rodney! 
10884,leo,Could you do that thing you were doing before? 
10885,leo,"Thanks, Rodney."
10886,leo,"It’s amazing, and that rifle’s really loaded, too."
10887,leo,Call me Leo.
10888,leo,"There’s no need to be nervous, Barry. We know you’re one of us."
10889,leo,"I say, we know you’re one of us. Six Commissioners on the F.E.C. Two just resigned, leaving  four, including you. The belief has always been that none of the four of you favor a ban on  soft money contributions. But the truth is, you do. "
10890,leo,"Yes, it is. And the way that I know that it is is cause you said so. You said so to the  Newark Star Ledger on March 13, 1995, ""Money isn’t speech."" And you said so two years before  that to the Detroit Free Press, ""We must reverse the 1978 Regulatory decision allowing soft  money."" "
10891,leo,Not anymore.
10892,leo,"Hey, I know how you feel. I went to drug rehab on the condition of anonymity. Maybe you  read about it in the papers. "
10893,leo,"Barry, Barry! You want to ban soft money. You’re one of us. You’ve been outed."
10894,leo,I understand.
10895,leo,"Plus, you would’ve had a hard time getting re-upped by the Senate when your term expired."
10896,leo,"On the other hand, if we hadn’t gone out and found ya, you probably never would have been  invited to the White House."
10897,leo,What’s that?
10898,leo,"No one’s intimidating you, Barry. You’re with us. You were wandering for years in the  darkness, but we came and found ya. And welcome back to the pack."
10899,leo, Barry.
10900,leo,Nonsense. Let me show you around the place. 
10901,leo,"No problem, we keep it in here. "
10902,leo,"Mr. President, I’m so sorry to interrupt."
10903,bartlet,"Not at all, we’re just having a nightcap."
10904,leo,I’d like you to meet Barry Haskell from the F.E.C.
10905,bartlet,"Oh, may I present Treasury Secretary, Kenneth..."
10906,bartlet,Mr. Attorney General.
10907,bartlet,"Our CIA Director, Rob Conrad."
10908,bartlet,"Barry, I’m Jed Bartlet. I understand you’re thinking about helping us out. It makes me  so happy. "
10909,bartlet,"Well, let’s get him a drink."
10910,bartlet,Leo... 
10911,leo,Just put him in the boat.
10912,bartlet,This could all be for nothing.
10913,leo,Yeah. 
10914,bartlet,"I mean, if the numbers... "
10915,leo,Yeah. 
10916,bartlet,Did we start?
10917,leo,We put the polling in the field 3 hours ago.
10918,bartlet,All right. Did the guys make any predictions?
10919,leo,"No, I didn’t ask."
10920,bartlet,"Yes, you did. "
10921,leo,They think we’re going to hold at 42. Toby thinks we drop a few points but inside the margin.
10922,bartlet,It could be worse.
10923,leo,Yeah. 
10924,bartlet,I mean it could be worse than holding at 42.
10925,leo,Yeah. 
10926,bartlet,"‘Cause if these numbers keep going down, I’m just a guy with Barry Haskell in his office."
10927,leo,I’ll stop back in ten minutes.
10928,bartlet,A dress Marine guarding your door?
10929,leo,Too showy?
10930,bartlet,"Nah... My thing is, what’s he suppose to be guarding right now? "
10931,leo,I’ll be right in here. 
10932,bartlet,Thanks. 
10933,leo,"Thank you, Mr. President. "
10934,sam,You’re in the library the night before?
10935,sam,Nobody does. Listen...
10936,sam,"There’s a reason to believe a staffer in the Majority Leader’s office knows about you.  He knows that I know you and he’s probably known the information for some time, but is  waiting for the moment when the information can cause the most trouble. "
10937,sam,"No, it’s not okay, but..."
10938,sam,You know what’s fun?
10939,sam,The Potomac in the morning.
10940,sam,Jogging around the Potomac or sculling. 
10941,sam,No. 
10942,sam,"No. I was sitting on a bench having a bagel, but from where I was, both jogging and  sculling looked good to me. "
10943,toby,Bonnie.
10944,toby,I need you to arrange a meeting with Ross Kassenbach.
10945,toby,"As soon as possible. Also, I need the next two minutes the President’s got."
10946,sam, Found one?
10947,toby,Yeah. 
10948,sam,What? 
10949,toby,Ambassador to the Federated States of Micronesia.
10950,sam,Is that a real country?
10951,toby,Yup. 
10952,sam,The Federated States of Micronesia?
10953,toby,Yes. 
10954,sam,‘Cause it sounds like a place the Marx brothers would...
10955,toby,Real country.
10956,toby,Yeah. 
10957,toby, Come with me for this. 
10958,bartlet,Based on what?
10959,bartlet,Based on what is he making that claim?
10960,c.j.,Based on the memo....
10961,bartlet,We’ve been out there for three weeks.
10962,bartlet,"Good morning, Charlie."
10963,c.j.,Morning. 
10964,bartlet,"We’ve been... we’ve been out there for three weeks. Crossfire, Meet the Press, Charlie  Rose, The Today Show, The Tonight Show, Good Morning Scottsdale..."
10965,c.j.,Sir. 
10966,bartlet,"...Time, Newsweek, Popular Mechanics. We’ve been out there saying we’re not talking about  legalization. We are talking about treatment."
10967,c.j.,There’s a memo. It’s the same memo that’s been generated by every administration for  thirty years.
10968,bartlet,"Well, how do you want to handle it?"
10969,c.j.,By saying it’s the same that’s been generated by every administration for thirty years. 
10970,bartlet,I don’t know. It sounds like we’re soft on the issue.
10971,toby,"Good morning, Mr. President."
10972,sam,"Good morning, sir. "
10973,bartlet,Steve Onorato is saying I want to legalize drugs. 
10974,sam,That’s the exact same memo that’s been generated by every administration for thirty years.
10975,c.j.,That’s...
10976,toby,"C.J., that’s exactly what you should say."
10977,c.j.,Thanks.
10978,bartlet,Hmmm... Leo was in here last night. He said you guys predicted we’d hold steady at 42.  Were you just being optimistic or you really think we held our ground. 
10979,toby,"I said we might drop a couple, but inside the margin."
10980,sam,I think we held our ground.
10981,c.j.,I didn’t say that sir.
10982,bartlet,Sorry? 
10983,c.j.,"I didn’t say we’d hold steady at 42, Mr. President. I said we’d gain five points. "
10984,bartlet,Yeah? 
10985,c.j.,"Yes, sir."
10986,bartlet,"Well, okay. Anybody want to offer C.J. the odds? "
10987,bartlet, Talk to the press.
10988,c.j.,"Yes, sir."
10989,bartlet,Tell them every administration for the past thirty years has generated that memo.
10990,c.j.,"Yes, sir."
10991,bartlet,That’s it.
10992,c.j.,"Thank you, Mr. President.  "
10993,bartlet, What do you got?
10994,toby,The Federated States of Micronesia.
10995,sam,Toby says it’s a country.
10996,bartlet, It is a country. You know where?
10997,toby,I assume it’s a small island in the South Pacific.
10998,bartlet,"It’s actually 607 small islands in the South Pacific. Interestingly, while its total  land mass is only 270 square miles, it occupies more than a million square miles of the  Pacific Ocean. Population is 127,000 and the U.S. Embassy is located in the state of  Pohnpei and not, as many people believe, on the island of Yap."
10999,toby,Why would a person have that information at their disposal? 
11000,bartlet,Parties.
11001,toby,Uh sir.
11002,bartlet,I looked at the Federated States of Micronesia. I can’t fire our ambassador.
11003,toby,Why not?
11004,bartlet,Somebody’s going to ask me why I fired him and I’m not gonna be able to come up with  the answer they’re looking for.
11005,toby,"Well, Sam’s got you covered."
11006,bartlet,How? 
11007,sam,You’re not going to fire the ambassador. You’re going to promote him.
11008,bartlet,To what?
11009,sam,Ambassador to Paraguay.
11010,bartlet,And what happens to the ambassador of Paraguay?
11011,sam,You make him ambassador to Bulgaria.
11012,bartlet,"Hey, I like this. Of course, if everybody keeps moving up one, then I get to go home."
11013,sam,"The Bulgarian ambassador is believed to be having an affair with the daughter of Prime  Minister, Toder Lukanov."
11014,bartlet,"That ambassador is Ken Cochran, isn’t it?"
11015,toby,"Yes, sir."
11016,bartlet,He’s having an affair with the daughter of the Bulgarian Prime Minister?
11017,toby,"Who, the State Department, is saying is upset."
11018,bartlet,I can imagine.
11019,sam,"Do you know him, sir?"
11020,bartlet,Prime Minister of Bulgaria?
11021,sam,Ambassador Cochran.
11022,bartlet,I know his wife.
11023,sam,Ouch. 
11024,bartlet,I got to fire Ken Cochran?
11025,toby,"Yes, sir."
11026,bartlet,"All right, then I don’t want it to be because of the girl."
11027,sam,Why not?
11028,bartlet,I know his wife.
11029,toby,We can create legitimate grounds for incompetence.
11030,bartlet,"Well, it looks to me like there are legitimate grounds for incompetence, but... come up  with different ones, would you? "
11031,toby,"Yes, sir."
11032,bartlet,"All right, let’s do it."
11033,bartlet,Charlie!
11034,bartlet,"I need to meet with Ambassador Cochran. He can be found in his office at the U.S Embassy  in Bulgaria, or not. Either way, I’d like the State Department to put his ass on a plane  and have it in this office tomorrow. "
11035,bartlet,Thank you.
11036,bartlet,Yeah. 
11037,bartlet,What? 
11038,bartlet,"It looked like when I said ""Ken Cochran"", that you knew who he was."
11039,bartlet,Okay. 
11040,josh,They might put it on the table.
11041,josh,They might...
11042,josh,I’m saying if they do put it on the table...
11043,josh,Is there any possibility you’re going to let me finish a sentence? Is there any chance  at all that that’s going to happen?
11044,josh,How the hell do you know if I’m raising my voice to you?
11045,josh,You’re here to give me a counter argument on English as the official language of the  United States. You are not here to speculate on whether or not the Republicans are going  to put the issue on the table.
11046,josh,Good! 
11047,josh,What’d she say?
11048,josh,"Okay, look..."
11050,josh,What? 
11052,josh,C.J. started the briefing already?
11054,josh,The briefing is not supposed to start ‘til eleven.
11056,josh,My watch sucks?
11058,josh," Okay, I’ll be back and when I get back, you’re going to argue with me and we’re  going to argue about the things I want to argue about and you’re going to do your best not  to annoy me so much. "
11059,josh,Oh-ho-ho!  Many have tried.
11060,josh,Did Toby find a country?
11062,josh,Is that a real country?
11064,josh,When was I supposed to take you to Hawaii?
11066,josh,The Federated States of Micronesia.
11068,josh,Okay. 
11070,josh,"Stop talking, now. "
11072,josh,Shhhh...
11073,c.j.,"Hang on, Mandatory Minimums requires a federal judge to sentence anyone convicted of  possessing five grams of crack to at least five years in prison. It takes 100 times as  much powder cocaine and 20 times as much heroine to get that sentence. 70% of all drug  users are white. 80% of crack users are black. Federal Mandatory Minimums for crack  users are a war on the black community. "
11074,c.j.,Danny. 
11075,c.j.,"Oh please. Katie, you have a question."
11076,c.j.,"The White House is committed to reversing the devastating affects of drug abuse in our  society. We believe the best way to do that is to treat drug addiction as what the AMA  has said it is, which is a medical problem. We do not believe in a phony war on drugs.  The chief accomplishment of which would be to either kill or incarcerate black drug users. "
11077,c.j.,Steve Onorato is saying the White House supports legalization? 
11078,c.j.,"How surprising that in the midst of an important debate the President would be accused  of being soft on drugs. Steve Onorato has a memo written by the Assistant Surgeon General.  I’d be happy to produce similar memos written for every President in the last thirty years,  including four Republicans. That’s all, thank you everybody."
11079,c.j.,It was a ridiculous question.
11080,c.j.,Is the White House crusading for the rights of drug users? You know that’s not what I meant.
11081,c.j.,"Oh, so you were just helping out."
11082,c.j.,Let’s find out.
11083,c.j.,Hang on. 
11084,c.j.,"They talk about it here, Danny. They talk about it here."
11085,c.j.,They don’t say it.
11086,c.j.,Yes. 
11087,c.j., I have to go back to work.
11088,c.j.,"Call the phone banks, check in with the poll."
11089,c.j.,Check again. 
11090,leo,Yeah?
11091,leo,Okay. 
11092,leo, Uh... Okay.
11093,leo,Why? 
11094,leo,Okay. 
11095,c.j.,Hi. 
11096,leo,Hey. 
11097,c.j.,The lid is on.
11098,leo,You told me.
11099,c.j.,Hmm? 
11100,leo,You called me an hour ago and told me it was a full lid.
11101,c.j.,Yeah... I’m going to the phone banks to check in with the poll.
11102,leo,Okay. 
11103,c.j.,"Leo, this is a small thing and I hate to bring it up."
11104,leo,What? 
11105,c.j.,"I was in with the President this morning, AND he mentioned that you told him that when  you asked for predictions, everyone said we’d hold steady at 42. "
11106,leo,Yeah? 
11107,c.j.,"But, I didn’t say that. I said we’d go up five points."
11108,leo,"I meant in general, on average."
11109,c.j.,Yeah. 
11110,leo,"C.J., like lopping off the score from the East German judge."
11111,c.j.,"Leo, it wasn’t woman’s intuition. I think it’s strange...."
11112,leo,Don’t read too much into it.
11113,c.j.,I’m saying its strange my take wasn’t...
11114,leo,I’m saying don’t read too much into it.   All right?
11115,c.j.,Okay. 
11116,leo,Anything else?
11117,c.j.,"No, I’m going to check the phone banks."
11118,josh,Theodore Roosevelt said...
11119,josh,Let me tell you what Theodore Roosevelt said.
11120,josh,Because the Republicans are going to bring it up.
11121,josh,"He said, ""We have room for but one language here, and that is the English language.  For we intend to see that the crucible turns our people out as Americans, and not as  dwellers in a polyglot boarding house."""
11122,josh,Polyglot. It means... ah... having knowledge of or speaking... 
11123,josh,They why did you ask me?
11124,josh,My point is...
11125,josh,Mandy’s wound a little tight during polling windows.
11126,c.j., What are you all doing here?
11127,josh,Here’s another laid-back member of our team.
11128,c.j.,What are you all doing here?
11129,josh,Mandy’s here cause she’s suppose to be. Joey’s here because Al Kiefer told her to stop by...
11130,c.j.,And what are you doing here?
11131,josh,I’m kind of in charge of morale.
11132,c.j.,Josh. 
11133,josh,The calls are going great.
11134,c.j.,"I’m trying to meet a deadline, Josh. I’ve got a 48-hour window and you can’t stand here  distracting the female callers. "
11135,josh, Have I been distracting the female callers? 
11136,c.j.,Josh. 
11137,josh,Not even a little bit?
11138,c.j.,This is what I’m saying.
11139,josh,The window’s fine. It’s a good response rate. They’re making their quotas. Stop bothering me.
11140,c.j.,Did Josh mention he’s in charge of morale?
11141,josh,"Yes, I am. And as such, I’m going out to get coffee for everyone ‘cause a few hundred  volts of caffeine is just what the doctor ordered around here.   And you should’ve been more impressed that I was able to quote Theodore Roosevelt."
11142,josh,"760 S.A.T. word, baby. "
11143,sam,You are both drunk and disorderly.
11144,sam,Happy graduation.
11145,sam,We worked in cahoots.
11146,sam,"Good night, Janeane."
11147,sam,A graduation gift.
11148,sam,Open the box.
11149,sam,It’s a good one. It writes upside down and you can use that pen in outer space.
11150,sam,"Happy graduation, counselor."
11151,sam,"Way to go, Laurie."
11152,sam,"I have to go. You spending the night here, or are you going to take off?"
11153,sam,Did you see anybody get into that car? 
11154,toby,He’s ready to see us.
11155,sam,What’d he say?
11156,toby,"He said, ""Get your ass over here."""
11157,sam,I’ve drafted a letter of resignation.
11158,toby,"Well you’re not going to give it to him, Sam, because that would deny me the pleasure  of throwing you out through a plate glass window."
11159,sam,You have every right to say that.
11160,toby,Thank you for acknowledging that right.
11161,sam,Toby... 
11162,toby,"I should keep you on a leash, you know that?"
11163,sam,Leo... 
11164,leo,"I’m talking to C.J., then I’m talking to you."
11165,toby,Ten-foot chain around your neck. I bolt you to your desk and have someone come in and  feed you.
11166,c.j.," Not the DOW Industrials, the NASDAQ composite."
11167,leo,How do you not tell me until this morning?
11168,c.j.,Leo... 
11169,leo,How do you not call me last night?
11170,c.j.,We didn’t know anything last night. 
11171,leo,Sam called you.
11172,c.j.,That’s right. He met the girl and saw a suspicious car. I’m not going to call up the  White House Chief of Staff in the middle of the night because someone started a car.
11173,leo,"C.J., if it was..."
11174,c.j.,"I was handling it, Leo. It took me three hours to confirm there was a picture, and  another hour to find out who has it. "
11175,leo,Who has it?
11176,c.j.,"The London Daily Mirror. They paid a waitress friend of hers $50,000 to set it up and  confirm that she was a call girl."
11177,leo,When is it running?
11178,c.j.,It’ll run later today. American Press has it tomorrow morning. 
11179,leo,He was giving her a graduation present?
11180,c.j.,Yeah. 
11181,leo,Work the Post and the Times.
11182,c.j.,Yeah. 
11183,bartlet,You never paid this girl to have sex?
11184,sam,No sir.
11185,toby,"They didn’t have that kind of relationship, sir. Except once, and that time he didn’t  know what was happening."
11186,bartlet,"Well, that makes two of us."
11187,toby,"Mr. President, Sam has always been completely above board about his relationship with Laurie."
11188,bartlet,Laurie’s the girl?
11189,sam,"Yes, sir."
11190,toby,"He told us about it right after his first contact with her nine months ago. The fact that  she was putting herself through law school, under circumstances that were less than good,  has to mean something, as is the fact that Sam’s word is unimpeachable."
11191,bartlet,"Toby, are you in here sticking up for Sam?"
11192,toby,"I know it’s strange, sir. But I’m feeling a-a... certain big brotherly connection right  now. You know, obviously, I’d like that feeling to go away as soon as possible. But for  the moment, I think there’s no danger in the White House standing by Sam and aggressively  going after the people who set him up."
11193,bartlet," Sam, you’re going to spend the morning in the White House Counsel’s office  finding out if you’ve broke any laws."
11194,sam,"Yes, sir."
11195,bartlet,You should also call the girl... what’s her name?
11196,sam,Laurie.
11197,bartlet,You should call her and tell her the White House deeply regrets the phenomenal inconvenience  she’s about to experience.
11198,sam,"Yes, sir."
11199,bartlet,You might also want to point out to her that she probably has a cause of action against  the paper.
11200,sam,"Yes, sir."
11201,bartlet,"And you should tell her that if she passes her Bar exam, the U.S. Attorney General will  personally see to it that she’s admitted to the Bar."
11202,sam,"Yes, sir."
11203,bartlet,Tell her the President of the United States says congratulations on getting her degree.
11204,sam,"Yes, sir."
11205,bartlet,That’s all.
11206,sam,"Thank you, Mr. President. "
11207,bartlet,"It’s nice when we can do something for prostitutes once in a while, isn’t it?"
11208,toby,"Yes, sir."
11209,bartlet,Are we ready to go?
11210,bartlet,Where are we putting Lobell and his people?
11211,bartlet,He’s going to have a lot of staff with him.
11212,toby,"Yes, sir."
11213,bartlet,"I don’t know what any of them do, but there they are where ever Lobell goes, 14-15 guys...."
11214,bartlet,I’m going to take care of this first and I’ll see you across the hall.
11215,toby,"Thank you, Mr. President. "
11216,bartlet,Who’s in the Mural room?
11217,bartlet,You did it again.
11218,bartlet,"When you said the name ‘Cochran’, it was like you knew him. "
11219,bartlet,I have a sense about these things.
11220,bartlet,A finely honed sense.
11221,bartlet,Cochran’s in the Mural room?
11222,bartlet,Why don’t you go sit with him and send in Ted Mitchell.
11223,bartlet,Thank you.
11224,bartlet,"Yes, of course.  Thank you."
11225,bartlet,Ted.
11226,bartlet,Thank you for coming.
11227,bartlet,You’re looking good.
11228,bartlet,How is Mary?
11229,bartlet,"All right, listen. I have something to do in the next room. Let me just tell you that  I need a favor."
11230,bartlet,I need you to hire a guy.
11231,bartlet,A former ambassador to Bulgaria.
11232,bartlet,Ken Cochran.
11233,bartlet,"Not for long. Look, he’s a good man, a smart man; I think he’d make a very good corporate  officer."
11234,bartlet,Gross incompetence. I’ll be right back.
11235,bartlet,"Good morning, Nancy."
11236,bartlet,"Yeah, I’ll be right in."
11237,bartlet,Ken. 
11238,bartlet,Thank you for flying in on such short notice.
11239,bartlet,Resign.
11240,bartlet,"You’ve been having an affair with the daughter of the Prime Minister and that doesn’t  work for me. But neither does the newspaper article saying you’re having an affair with  the daughter of the Prime Minister. So, I need you to resign. You’re going to get a job  offer from Ted Mitchell for a lot more money than you’re making now, that’s why you left  the Embassy. I’ll be back in a minute."
11241,bartlet, Thanks for waiting.
11242,bartlet,"It doesn’t have anything to do with... Oh, wait a second. You two have a past?"
11243,bartlet,You mocked my finely honed sense.
11244,bartlet,You stood there in my face...
11245,bartlet,"It’s done Ken. Ted Mitchell’s going to put you on the Board of Directors, and please  remember that I have a lot of affection for your wife, and I would hate to see her be  made a fool of."
11246,bartlet,What’s that?
11247,bartlet,"Well, thanks for trying, but here I am anyway. Got to go."
11248,toby,All set?
11249,bartlet,Look at that. 14 staffers in there.
11250,toby,"You have quite a huge staff, too, Mr. President."
11251,bartlet,"Yeah, but I don’t walk around with them, you know?"
11252,bartlet,Good morning.
11253,bartlet,"Max, I don’t need to know all the names. It’s okay. Please, sit down."
11254,bartlet,"You know what we’re doing here, right?"
11255,bartlet,We’re going to do more than talk about it.
11256,bartlet,"We agree on nothing, Max."
11257,bartlet,"Education, guns, drugs, school prayer, gays, defense spending, taxes, you name it,  we disagree."
11258,bartlet,"‘Cause I’m a lily-livered, bleeding-heart, liberal, egg head, communist."
11259,bartlet,"Yes, you are."
11260,bartlet,We also agree on campaign finance.
11261,bartlet,"So, Max."
11262,bartlet,Let’s work together on campaign finance.
11263,bartlet,"I don’t need them. 1978, the FEC voted a regulatory rule that opened the door to soft  money. The FEC can close it again with 4 of the 6 votes. We don’t need a law."
11264,bartlet,"Two seats opened up, I nominated Bacon and Calhoun."
11265,bartlet,Barry Haskel was with us already. We took him out of the closet. 
11266,bartlet,"Toby’s going to take care of that right away. Max, can I count on your support to confirm  my candidates?"
11267,bartlet, The thanks of a grateful President.
11268,bartlet, Go.
11269,bartlet, Thank you.
11270,toby, Mr. Kassenbach.
11271,toby,"Hi, I’m Toby Ziegler. "
11272,toby,The President thinks you’ve done an excellent job on the Federal Election Commission  and would like to extend his warmest congratulations.
11273,toby,On being named the next ambassador to the Federated States of Micronesia.
11274,josh,It’s in.
11275,c.j.,Yeah. 
11276,josh,You’ve talked to them?
11277,c.j.,"They sealed it in an envelope, sent it by courier."
11278,josh,"So, Joey mentioned she talked to you."
11279,c.j.,Yeah. 
11280,josh,"She said, ""You think you only have so many times left you can walk into the Oval Office  and sing a song."""
11281,c.j.,"She said, ""Sing a song""?"
11282,josh,"No, that’s what I thought she said. I’m trying to pick up some sign and right now we’re  doing it by letters of the alphabet. So I had Kenny come over and interpret it, and it  turns out she said ""you think you only have so many times left you can come into the  Oval Office and say you’re wrong."" "
11283,c.j.,"He hasn’t been calling my number that much, Josh."
11284,josh,"He did on this. This last three weeks, the media strategy was yours."
11285,c.j.,I know.
11286,josh,You should listen to Joey. Holding at 42 is a good number. You shouldn’t expect a  five-point bump.
11287,c.j.,I do expect it.
11288,josh,"Okay.  He thinks of you like a daughter, C.J."
11289,c.j.,That’s not a good enough reason to keep me here.
11290,josh,You’ll come as soon as you get it?
11291,c.j.,Yup. 
11292,josh,Cause we’re all waiting over there.
11293,c.j.,Yeah. 
11294,leo,They’re delivering it to her?
11295,leo,And she’s going to bring it right here.
11296,leo,Okay. 
11297,bartlet,Kassenbach was okay?
11298,toby,"I’m sorry, sir?"
11299,bartlet,Kassenbach was okay?
11300,toby,He’s gonna be an ambassador; he feels pretty good.
11301,bartlet,Did you tell him about the weather?
11302,toby,"Yes, sir."
11303,bartlet,Scuba diving?
11304,toby," Yes, sir."
11305,bartlet,Full diplomatic immunity?
11306,toby,"Yes sir. Though, there really aren’t a... a lot of laws in Micronesia, sir."
11307,bartlet,Sure.
11308,josh, Good evening.
11309,bartlet,"Good evening, Josh."
11310,josh,I just saw C.J. She’ll be here with it in a minute.
11311,leo,Okay. 
11312,josh,Joey and I have been working on a counter argument to Alexis de Tocqueville.
11313,bartlet,We’re having a fight with Alexis de Tocqueville?
11314,josh,"Joey, what say you to the position that with ethnic warfare spreading around the globe,  and in particularly in Eastern Europe, it’s only a matter of time before it reaches our  shores and making English the official language of the United States will safeguard  against the destruction of our national identity and help us avoid ethnic strife? What  say you to that?"
11315,josh,You see that? That’s what I’ve been dealing with all week.
11316,josh,"Okay, that’s all I was looking for, that one line. Took you four days."
11317,josh,She did it again.
11318,bartlet,Yeah.
11319,bartlet,"What kind of briefcase did you get her, Sam?"
11320,sam,Sir? 
11321,bartlet,What kind of briefcase?
11322,sam,Coach Beekman in British tan with brass hardware.
11323,bartlet,That’s nice.
11324,sam,"Yes, sir."
11325,bartlet,"Andare makes a nice model. Comes in black or brown, hand stained, fit a laptop, notebooks,  the works."
11326,toby,This conversation is surreal.
11327,bartlet,Trieste in Milan makes a nice briefcase.
11328,c.j.,"Good evening, Mr. President. The full polling book is 400 pages long and it’s still  being put together. I have the top sheet results."
11329,leo,What does it say?
11330,c.j.,I was wrong. We went up nine points.
11331,bartlet,"Okay, what’s next?"
11332,leo,We should talk about the new projections.
11333,bartlet,"I don’t think I answered the last one. Suzanne’s got me telling jokes. Here’s an answer  to your question that I don’t think you’re going to like the current crop of 18-25 year  olds is the most politically apathetic generation in American history. In 1972, half of  that age group voted. In the last election, 32%. Your generation is considerably less  likely than any previous one to write or call public officials, attend rallies, or work  on political campaigns. A man once said this, ""decisions are made by those who show up.""  So are we failing you, or are you failing us? It's a little of both.  "
11334,bartlet,". . .there’s a guy on my staff who showed me a report from the Center of Policy  Alternatives that said 61% of your age group agree with the statement ""Politicians  and political officials - "
11335,josh,The Center of Policy Alternatives. C.J. will have copies for the bus ride back. 
11336,sam,Why? 
11337,sam,From who? 
11338,sam,Give it to me. 
11339,sam,Toby? 
11340,toby,Josh.  
11341,josh,Leo.
11342,leo,What’s that? 
11343,josh,It’s the signal. 
11344,leo,I thought that was the signal for the other thing? 
11345,josh,"It’s the signal for this thing, now. "
11346,leo,When did that happen? 
11347,josh,"It happened just... who cares, Leo? It’s the signal for this thing, now. "
11348,leo,"So, we’re totally out of the woods? "
11349,josh,Go tell the President. 
11350,c.j.,Follow me. 
11351,c.j.,I have a tip. 
11352,c.j.,Yes. 
11353,c.j.,I have a tip and I’m going to give it to you before the others. 
11354,c.j.,No. 
11355,c.j.,I have news. 
11356,c.j.,I want you to acknowledge that I’m doing something nice for you. 
11357,c.j.,A peace pipe of sorts. 
11358,c.j.,"An offering, in one sense. "
11359,c.j.,Call your science editor. 
11360,c.j.,It’s about the Space Shuttle Columbia. 
11361,bartlet,"Generation x advocacy group third millennium, 53 of 18 to 25 year olds believe the soap  opera General Hospital will outlast Medicare. This from a generation convinced that the  generation before them has ransomed their generation’s future. That’s why my youngest  daughter Zoey is always mad at me. "
11362,bartlet,"This is the part where Zoey tries to crawl under a seat to hide. Don’t worry about it,  sweetie, I’ll bring out the baby pictures any second now. "
11363,josh,Yeah. 
11364,josh,Yeah. 
11365,josh,Yeah. 
11366,josh,About what? 
11367,josh,Here we go.  
11368,leo,What’s going on? 
11369,leo,Didn’t come back from where? 
11370,leo,Iraq. 
11371,leo,We have an F-117 down in Iraq. 
11372,leo,How much of this is confirmed?
11373,leo,How much time? 
11374,leo,"Ten minutes, and then I’m bringing in the President. "
11375,bartlet,"It seems to me that if this event is over by 10:00, then I can be back here by 11, and  you know what that means. "
11376,bartlet,Did you just snicker when you said that? 
11377,bartlet,"Yes, you did. "
11378,bartlet,"Thanks, Lou.  When you said Girls Softball Game, you snickered. "
11379,bartlet,"Yes, you snickered. As if to indicate there was something wrong with my wanting to see a  girls’ softball game live via satellite."
11380,bartlet,"Thanks, Phil.  I am excited about it! You come  to the end of a long day, you sit back, you open a beer, you watch a sporting event.  That’s what men do."
11381,bartlet,"If that’s what’s on, then that’s what they watch. It’s either that, or a cricket match  between Scotland and Bermuda. Now, I am an educated man, Charlie, but when someone tries  to explain cricket to me, all I want to do is hit him in the head with a teapot. "
11382,bartlet,"Good morning, Patty.  So, it’s softball. Sacramento State versus the  University of the Pacific."
11383,bartlet,"Now, you’re not going to spoil my fun. "
11384,bartlet,"I’m going to get back at the end of the day, sit back, open a beer..."
11385,bartlet,That’s right! 
11386,bartlet,"Hey, Steve. Hey, Mikey.  Listen, have I got any of the names right so far? "
11387,bartlet,Okay. 
11388,bartlet,"Good morning, everybody! "
11389,c.j., I hope you don’t mind if we get right to it. 
11390,bartlet,Sure. 
11391,c.j.,"It’s a town hall meeting broadcast live on MSNBC. For the purposes of this rehearsal,  Carol will be the moderator, she’ll be seated at your right, which is camera left.  You’ll have a pitcher and a drinking glass. "
11392,bartlet,"And when I speak, I should stand facing the audience, right? "
11393,c.j.,Sir 
11394,bartlet,"Do you know how I know this, C.J.? Because I’ve done it 2,000 to 300,000 times before.   Hey, Sam. "
11395,sam,"Yes, sir? "
11396,bartlet,Why didn’t the Columbia land last night? 
11397,sam,"I’m sorry, sir? "
11398,bartlet,"The Space Shuttle was supposed to land last night, someone told me that it didn’t. "
11399,sam,"I don’t know, sir. "
11400,bartlet,Why don’t you go ask Toby? 
11401,sam,Why would Toby know? 
11402,bartlet,His brother’s on that flight. 
11403,sam,Really? 
11404,bartlet,He’s a payload specialist. 
11405,sam,I didn’t know that 
11406,bartlet,"He’s up there with four red-bellied Japanese newts. He wants to see how a newt’s inner  ears, which are remarkably similar to humans, are influenced by the absence of gravity.   Do you know what he calls them, C.J.? "
11407,c.j.,Astro-newts? 
11408,bartlet,100% right.  Go ask him why it didn’t land. 
11409,sam,"Yes, sir. Bartlet walks up to Stage and sits on stool. C.J follows him. "
11410,c.j.,"Okay, Mr. President. "
11411,bartlet,"C.J., you say I have a pitcher of water and a drinking glass. Now the water gets into  the glass how? "
11412,toby,"And the question will go something like this, Mr. President, your administration has  pursued a policy of, what? Constructive engagement..."
11413,toby,"...towards China, even though it’s a communist country that has systemically, what,  imprisoned dissidents..."
11414,toby,"Okay, oppressed blah, blah, blah. At the same time, your administration has refused to  engage Cuba. Why the double standard? "
11415,toby,Thanks. 
11416,sam,Toby? 
11417,toby,"We need an answer on Cuba. We need an answer on Cuba, and we need an answer on farm loans. "
11418,sam,"Toby, college students aren’t going to ask questions on Cuba. "
11419,toby,There will be faculty there. 
11420,sam,"You know, not only did I not know that you had a brother on the Space Shuttle right now,  I didn’t know you had a brother. "
11421,toby,Yeah. 
11422,sam,I didn’t know you had a brother! 
11423,toby,I do. 
11424,sam,Do you know why the Space Shuttle didn’t land last night? 
11425,toby,Why? 
11426,sam,Were you aware that the Space Shuttle was supposed to land last night and didn’t? 
11427,toby,"What do you want from me, Sam? Is there something going on on the shuttle? "
11428,sam,I’ll find out. 
11429,toby,Thank you. And write me the answer on Cuba. 
11430,sam,Okay.
11431,josh,Donna? 
11433,josh,Did you get me the meeting with the Vice President? 
11435,josh,Jogging! 
11437,josh,"We couldn’t really, this time, just sit in chairs? "
11439,josh,"Okay, order me boiled chicken and some pasta. Nothing like a meeting you have to carb-up  for. "
11441,josh," Yeah, I’m headed to the Press Room. "
11442,josh, Donna? 
11444,josh,Where’s my chair? 
11446,josh,Where’s my chair? 
11448,josh,The chair I sit in at my desk. 
11450,josh,At the shop? 
11452,josh,"Yeah, you call up a guy in maintenance, he uses a screwdriver. "
11454,josh,I didn’t even know there was a shop. 
11456,josh,What? 
11458,josh,Your friend Curtis. 
11460,josh,Is fixing my chair? 
11462,josh,And how much is Curtis charging the Federal Government to fix the wobbly wheel on my  chair? 
11464,josh,At his shop. 
11466,josh,Okay. 
11467,bartlet,I proposed 
11468,bartlet,I wouldn’t say my administration is nibbling around the edges. 
11469,josh,"Don’t repeat the phrase, sir, that will be the soundbite. If we don’t have a solution,  the least we can do is acknowledge that there is a problem. "
11470,bartlet,"I agree with you that far too many Americans don’t have adequate access to health  insurance, and that far too many of them are children. Yes, we can and we must do more. "
11471,leo,Mr. President? 
11472,bartlet,Hang on.  Now can I blame Congress? 
11473,josh,Knock yourself out. 
11474,leo,"Mr. President, I need you in the situation room. "
11475,bartlet,Is the pilot still alive? 
11476,bartlet,He’s in the middle of nowhere. 
11477,leo,Who else is out there? 
11478,bartlet,Our guy is ten miles from the Fourth Corps of the Iraqi Republican Guard? 
11479,leo,"Fitz, you got a rescue scenario? "
11480,leo,They use the PAVE Hawks? 
11481,leo, These are the special equipped helicopters. They fly treetop  altitude at about 180 knots.
11482,leo,"Oh, please. "
11483,leo,"Bill, you wanna check with the embassy?"
11484,leo,"I'll tell you what, Phil. How about I drop you and your 47 million-dollar warplane that’s  already been picked up by Iraqi radar in the middle of the desert. Then you tell me if  we’ve got three hours to find a diplomatic solution before we come and get you! "
11485,bartlet,What’s his name? 
11486,bartlet,The pilot. What’s his name? 
11487,bartlet,Where’s he from? 
11488,bartlet,How old is he? 
11489,bartlet,"Rob told me in my intelligence briefing last week that the Iraqi government has put out  a bounty the equivalent of 14,000 dollars U.S on any American plane shot down, or any  American soldier captured. Now, he was just patrolling the No Fly zone, right? "
11490,bartlet,He had not engaged. 
11491,bartlet,"Bill, if it ends up that Fitzwallace has to call this kid’s parents, I swear to God I’m  invading Baghdad.  Get him back. "
11492,c.j.,Yeah. 
11493,leo,"Oh C.J., The Iraqis shot down an F-117 Nighthawk in the Southern No-Fly Zone. "
11494,c.j.,Is the pilot still alive? 
11495,leo,"Yeah, but he’s caught between a couple of divisions of the Republican Guard. "
11496,c.j.,Is there a Pentagon...?
11497,leo,Pentagon team is coming over to brief you. 
11498,c.j.,Is there a rescue mission? 
11499,leo,President gave the order about an hour ago. 
11500,c.j.,"If the Iraqis shot down an F-117, they’re going to want to tell the world about it. "
11501,leo,Yeah. 
11502,c.j.,"There’s going to be film of a burning airplane on CNN within two hours, and the press  will have the news before you get done with whatever it is you’ve got going on in the  situation room. "
11503,leo,Which is the problem of conducting a covert rescue mission in this age of instant news.  You understand what I’m telling you? 
11504,c.j.,"Yes, I do. "
11505,leo,‘Cause there was a problem.
11506,c.j.,"Leo, I’m saying..."
11507,leo,"There was a problem a few months ago with India/Pakistan, you were uncomfortable - "
11508,c.j.,Leo.
11509,leo,You were uncomfortable lying to the press...
11510,c.j.,"I wasn’t lying to the press about India/Pakistan, I was lied to by you, which made me  look like an idiot. "
11511,leo,"Well, I’m not lying to you now. Four Mh-53 J Pay-lows carrying 80 guys from the 16th  special ops are out flying under radar. "
11512,c.j.,We’re going to pay a price for misleading the press. 
11513,leo,I don’t care. 
11514,c.j.,I understand. 
11515,josh," Leo, an F-117? "
11516,leo, You should go to your briefing. 
11517,leo, Yeah. 
11518,josh,"An F-117 is a stealth fighter, right? "
11519,leo,Yeah. 
11520,josh,"At some point, we’re going to be talking about how they shot down a stealth fighter. "
11521,leo,You can take that to the bank. 
11522,josh,"Anyway, I arranged a meeting with Hoynes. "
11523,leo,When? 
11524,josh,In an hour. 
11525,leo,Where? 
11526,josh,We’re jogging. 
11527,leo,Listen to me. Don’t tell him why it’s bad for us. Tell him why it’s bad for him. 
11528,josh,I’m not worried about the meeting. 
11529,leo,Come see me after. 
11530,toby,An F-117? 
11531,josh,Yes. 
11532,toby,How did it get seen? 
11533,josh,I’m sure that someone is looking into that. 
11534,toby,I would think so. 
11535,josh,"In it’s defense, the stealth fighter is a generation of technology behind the B-2 Spirit  Bomber. "
11536,toby,"It’s a stealth fighter, it should have stealth capability, right? "
11537,josh,Yeah. 
11538,toby,"Because if it doesn’t, we should call it something else. "
11539,sam,Hello. 
11540,toby,Hi. 
11541,sam,One of the payload bay doors would not close. 
11542,toby,I’m sorry. 
11543,sam,Specifically the starboard payload bay door. 
11544,toby,"Sam, if your ass isn’t off my desk, and I mean stat..."
11545,sam," This is not his first shuttle mission. It is his fourth shuttle mission,  Dr. David Ziegler, holding postgraduate degrees in both physiology and biology. Now I  know more about your brother than I do about you, since I didn’t know you had a brother. "
11546,toby,A payload bay door wouldn’t close? 
11547,sam,"I talked to the mission commander, guy name of Peter Jobson, he said the power drive unit  on the starboard pay load door is jammed, they were going to need an EVA to fix it, and  they didn’t want to land till the morning. "
11548,toby,It’s morning every 45 minutes on the shuttle. 
11549,sam,Morning at Edwards. 
11550,toby,It’s morning right now. 
11551,sam,The EVA’s taking them a little time. 
11552,toby,"Well, it’s a red-letter day for U.S. Aviation, isn’t it? "
11553,sam,Toby. Peter Jobson was very calm. He said it was a minor problem. 
11554,toby,"All right, then go back to work. C.J.’s going to need the briefing room, so let’s move  prep to the Roosevelt Room as soon as the President is free. "
11555,sam,"I don’t believe he’s going to get anything on Cuba, but weíre working out an answer.  Also on teachers. "
11556,toby,"Okay.  Sam? Keep in touch with Peter Jobson and let me know as  soon as it lands, would you? "
11557,sam,Yeah. 
11558,toby,Yeah. 
11559,toby,Thank you. 
11560,josh,"There was a reckless deregulation of the S&L industry by a Democratic Congress, it was  flooded with S&L donations. A disaster which nearly collapsed the banking industry and  cost the taxpayers 500 billion dollars. "
11561,josh,We’re no better with the money than they are. 
11562,josh,"Three-quarters of all soft money coming to the Democratic party isn’t coming from labor  unions, it’s coming from corporations. "
11563,josh,"Over a hundred businesses gave both parties in excess of $125,000 in the last election. "
11564,josh,"They gave it to both parties! This isn’t free speech or political values, Mr. Vice  President. I don’t know how we’ve done it, but we’ve legalized bribery. "
11565,josh,"So, now what we’ve got is two corporate parties - one pro-life, one pro-choice. "
11566,josh,We’ve noticed the sudden increase in racquetball and late-night poker games with  democratic opponents of campaign finance reform. 
11567,josh,"Can we stop running for a second?  You’re backing the wrong horse.  You read the same polls I do. President’s gone up nine points in three weeks. 51% job  approval - big deal. But he’s going on national television tonight, that’s going to be  another 5 that’s 56%, a 14-point bump in a month. "
11568,josh,"Hang on. If we bring this pilot back home alive, that’s another 10 points. And then  we’re off to the races with a job approval rating in the high 60s. Now every Democratic  congressman in a tight race is looking to get his picture taken with the president,  and you’re looking around the racquetball court, saying, ""Where did everybody go?""  You’ve had some experience battling Jed Bartlet when he’s right, and you’ve had some  experience battling him when he’s popular. Why in the world would you want to try it  when he’s both at the same time? "
11569,josh,"No sir, I know it for sure.  I’m done. Thank you for your time, sir. "
11570,c.j.,"Good Afternoon. A U.S. Air Force F-117-A Nighthawk Stealth fighter attack aircraft flying a routine patrol out of Al Jabar Air Force Base in Kuwait was shot down over the southern no-fly zone in Iraq. At this point, we don’t know the condition of the pilot. We do know  that the plane does carry an ACES II 0/0 ejector seat, and that is was activated. General  Richmond and General Clancy will talk more about that in a moment. "
11571,c.j.,Danny. 
11572,c.j.,"Obviously there are a number of scenarios being contemplated, but I wouldn’t want to  speculate. "
11573,c.j.,"We have been in touch with the Iraqi government, and the President is looking for a  diplomatic solution. "
11574,c.j.,No. 
11575,c.j.,Chris. 
11576,bartlet,Expanding healthcare coverage for 5 million more poor children. 
11577,bartlet,Making healthcare portable for people who change jobs. 
11578,bartlet,"You know what’s hard about all this, C.J.? "
11579,c.j.,Sir? 
11580,bartlet,"I’m rehearsing here without the pitcher and glass, it’s totally weird for me. "
11581,c.j.,Yeah. 
11582,sam,No. 
11583,sam,It’ll look staged. 
11584,sam,"What’s he going to do, throw it over his shoulder? "
11585,sam,I’m also not wild about the hand-held mike. Can we get him wired? 
11586,bartlet,"No, because with the mike and the stool, and the jacket thrown over my shoulder,  and I can do the town hall meeting, and then do a couple of sets at the Copa. "
11587,bartlet,"My musical director, Zoey Bartlet. "
11588,bartlet,We’re down to do I or do I not take my jacket off. 
11589,bartlet,"I honestly couldn’t care less. Listen, I want you to come with us tonight. "
11590,bartlet,I’m fine. 
11591,bartlet,Yeah. 
11592,bartlet,Zoey! 
11593,bartlet,"Are you channeling Mom, now? "
11594,bartlet,Come to Virginia tonight. 
11595,bartlet,It’s not like being there in person. 
11596,bartlet,Bonus. Then it’s settled. 
11597,bartlet,Okay. 
11598,bartlet,And you’re coming tonight. 
11599,bartlet,Thanks.  Gina. 
11600,bartlet,"All right, everyone, we’re done. Thanks very much. "
11601,bartlet,"Charlie, Zoey said you had something you wanted to mention? "
11602,bartlet,Zoey said you had something you wanted to mention. 
11603,bartlet,Are you sure? 
11604,bartlet,Okay. 
11605,sam,Mr. President? 
11606,bartlet,Yeah? 
11607,sam,I was thinking that it might not be a bad idea to have a signal worked out. 
11608,bartlet,A signal for what? 
11609,sam,"Good news regarding the pilot, if it comes while you’re on television. "
11610,bartlet,What kind of signal did you have in mind? 
11611,sam,Something like this.
11612,sam,"Very subtle, very simple. "
11613,bartlet,What is that? 
11614,sam,It’s departure. It’s a safe departure. Would you like a different signal? 
11615,bartlet,"No, that one’s good. "
11616,sam,Should I spread it around? 
11617,bartlet,"Well, I think it’s going to get around all by itself, but if you want to help it along  a little, there’s nothing wrong with that. "
11618,sam,"Thank you, Mr. President. "
11619,leo,"Hey, Josh. "
11620,josh,What’s going on? 
11621,leo,I just talked to Hoynes. 
11622,josh,Is he in? 
11623,leo,Yeah. He’s on board. You did a good job. 
11624,josh,Good. 
11625,leo,Josh? 
11626,josh,Yeah. 
11627,leo,"Did you happen to say to him that if Scott Hutchins comes back alive, there’ll be a ten  point bump? "
11628,josh,I did. 
11629,leo,"I gotta tell you, if the President ever heard about that, he’d be out of his skin. "
11630,josh,Leo.
11631,leo,Even in private! 
11632,josh,I was just...
11633,leo,"The guy’s been blown out of the sky! He might be seriously injured. For sure he’s in an  Iraqi desert with no water. He’s got to keep radio silence because we’re for sure not the  only ones looking for him, and if they get to him first, all he gives them is his name,  rank, and serial number, they’re going to beat him."
11634,josh,They’re going to torture him. This is to say nothing of the 80 guys in a helicopter who  are going to get shot at if they’re picked up underneath the radar. 
11635,josh,You’re right. 
11636,leo,"I know the President’s been joking around all day. But he’s been living and dying with  this every hour, and I know he’d be really offended if he knew that you were discussing  a political upside. And I gotta tell you, Josh, as a guy who flew planes in the war,  I was really offended, too. "
11637,josh,"Yes, sir. "
11638,leo,Okay. 
11639,josh,Okay. 
11640,leo,"Now, you did good today. I’m just saying that there’s a way to be a person. "
11641,josh,I apologize. 
11642,leo,Your apology’s accepted. 
11643,leo, What are you doing? 
11644,josh,It looked like you wanted to hug me. 
11645,leo,"Oh, man, did you read that wrong. "
11646,josh,Okay. 
11647,leo," Hey, Sam was here before. We’ve got some kind of signal? "
11648,josh,"Yeah, for if we know something during the town hall. "
11649,leo,Could be days. 
11650,josh,Maybe not. 
11651,leo,What is the signal? 
11652,josh,It’s this.  
11653,leo,What is that? 
11654,josh,It’s the signal. 
11655,leo,It looks like a hip-hop gesture. 
11656,josh,"It’s, uh, a plane taking off. "
11657,leo,Doesn’t look like a plane taking off. 
11658,josh,  This means something good has happened. 
11659,leo,I’ve got it. 
11660,josh,You don’t have to be a cryptographer. 
11661,leo,I said I’ve got it. 
11662,josh,Leo. I really do apologize. 
11663,leo,Thank you. 
11664,josh,Hi. 
11665,josh,"You can keep fighting in just a second, I just need to find something. "
11666,josh, Donna! 
11668,josh,How you doing? 
11670,josh,Yeah.
11671,toby,Come in. What do you know? 
11672,sam,Listen...
11673,toby,Sam. 
11674,sam,"No, it’s not... Cathy’s getting Peter Jobson on the phone for you, he’s going to tell  you about this. "
11675,toby,Sam.
11676,sam,"There was a screw-up when they closed the door. They were doing something, which is  called a manual winch op, which means they disconnect the motor from the door, and  somehow either as a result of that, or of something completely unrelated, the two OMS  engines are failing. OMS are the orbital maneuvering systems. "
11677,toby,Do you know if they have primary RCS? 
11678,sam,That’s what they’re trying now. 
11679,sam,"Toby. If this were at a certain level, they would call the President. "
11680,toby,Yeah. 
11681,sam,Seriously. 
11682,toby,Yeah. 
11683,sam,"Anyway, Cathy’s getting Peter Jobson. "
11684,toby,"Before, when you first asked me, the reason I reacted the way I didI was just embarrassed. Cause honestly, I forgot he was up there. They had switched his mission order around a  couple of times and I just lost track of it. "
11685,toby, Thank you. 
11686,bartlet,Yeah? 
11687,bartlet,Thanks. 
11688,bartlet,"No. Hey, what was it that Zoey was talking about before? "
11689,bartlet,What was it? 
11690,bartlet,It has? 
11691,bartlet,What’s the report? 
11692,bartlet,Yeah? 
11693,bartlet,Thank you. 
11694,bartlet,"Charlie, whatever it is, stick it in my briefcase, would you? "
11695,bartlet,Thank you. 
11696,bartlet,"Fitz, do you have any news at all?"
11697,bartlet,Okay.
11698,bartlet,No. 
11699,bartlet,I feel fine. 
11700,bartlet,"Yeah, I feel fine."
11701,bartlet,I don’t know. 
11702,bartlet,"I honestly don’t know, Fitz."
11703,bartlet,Fitz...
11704,bartlet,The kid’s all right? 
11705,bartlet,"Well, that’s, that’s a job awfully well done, Mr. Chairman. "
11706,bartlet,I owe you one.
11707,bartlet,"All the same, I’m going to check out that thing with the carpet. "
11708,bartlet,"Seriously, I’m going to get an answer for you on that. "
11709,bartlet,"Captain Hutchins, this is President Bartlet. How’s your ankle? Good. Now before you say  another word, give me your parents’ phone number. I never get to make this call.  "
11710,c.j.,"Radar officers aboard the Minneapolis monitored Captain Hutchins as his plane went what  is called ""Feet Dry"" south of the 33rd parallel. "
11711,c.j.,Katie. 
11712,c.j.,"We did use Saudi airspace, we flew secretly on the way in, they were informed of the  mission on the way out. "
11713,c.j.,That’s when the British were told.
11714,c.j.,"Folks, it’s a few minutes after seven. Most of us have to pile into buses to get over to  Arlington. All this material will be covered in much greater detail at the Pentagon  briefing, which will take place 30 minutes after our return. That’s all for now. "
11715,c.j.,"I have to congratulate you, Carol. I was afraid I was going to see Saudi Arabia spelled  with a ‘y’. "
11716,c.j.,"Yes. One ""l"" in Tel Aviv. "
11717,c.j.,In my office. 
11718,c.j.,"Danny, I don’t even want to hear it. I did exactly the right thing. Your nose is bent out  of joint, and I don’t give a damn. "
11719,c.j.,Danny...
11720,c.j.,"What did you think I was going to do, Danny? Give you longitude and latitude? Did you  think I was going to fork over the radio frequency that we’re transmitting on?"
11721,c.j.,I did! 
11722,c.j.,"Danny, if by standing up and lying, I misdirected Iraqi intelligence for even half a  beat, then it was absolutely worth it. That’s a no-brainer. And if I didn’t, it was  certainly worth trying. There were only 50 people in the world who can’t understand why  I lied this morning, and they all work in the White House pressroom. I’m sleeping fine  tonight. "
11723,c.j.,"Well, yes, I did. "
11724,c.j.,"No, I chose you. "
11725,c.j.,"Danny, I got to tell you, that was, seriously, that was a turn-on when you said that,  though I don’t know why you decided to be the most haughty on the Dallas Morning News. "
11726,c.j., The buses are leaving. 
11727,leo,Girls' softball? 
11728,bartlet,Womens' softball. It’s going to be great. Mrs. Landingham? I’m watching a live sporting  event from beginning to end tonight. 
11729,bartlet,"You’re not going to spoil my good time for me, Mrs. Landingham. "
11730,bartlet,Yeah. 
11731,bartlet,Do you see me walking out the door?
11732,bartlet,I’m leaving. 
11733,leo,"Sam’s got some notes for you on Cuba, and some notes on farm loans that I’d like you  to look over in the car. "
11734,bartlet," You know what, I'll be at the car in just a second. "
11735,leo,"Yes, sir. "
11736,bartlet,Thank you. 
11737,bartlet,Toby? 
11738,bartlet,Toby. 
11739,toby,"Excuse me, Mr. President. I’m sorry. "
11740,bartlet,"You can’t see them, they’re over Australia now. I just spoke with the mission commander.  They’re trying firing something called an RCS? "
11741,toby,"Yeah, it’s the reaction control system. It’s actually 40 separate engines around the  shuttle. "
11742,bartlet,"If that doesn’t work, they’ve got about 39 other things they can try. There’s redundancy  after redundancy after redundancy built in. And for good measure, they have Atlantis  warming up on the launch pad. It can dock with the Columbia in about two hours. We can  do that now, Toby. "
11743,toby,"First thing the shuttle does after it leaves the atmosphere is open the cargo bay doors.  That’s what lets the heat out. Once those doors close, they have a pretty short window to  get back before it overheats. "
11744,bartlet,Then they’ll open those doors again. 
11745,toby,How? 
11746,bartlet,Same way they closed them - with a five-dollar wrench. 
11747,toby,Mr. President.
11748,bartlet,"When we’re done tonight, you should take the next flight out to Edwards’ Air Force Base,  meet the thing when it lands, stop being a horse’s ass, and talk to your brother. "
11749,toby,"Mr. President. I appreciate you trying to be a comfort, and I appreciate that you have  some understanding of the situation with my brother. But the thing was supposed to land  19 hours ago. Obviously, there’s a problem. It’s space travel, and I don’t believe any  problem is minor. "
11750,bartlet,"Shuttle flies itself, Toby. "
11751,toby,"No, it doesn’t, Mr. President. "
11752,bartlet,"No, it doesn’t. "
11753,bartlet,"Thank you, thank you very much. That was a joke about politicians.   Two politicians are having an argument. The first one yells, 'but you’re lying!' and the  other one answers, ‘yes, I know, but hear me out!"" "
11754,bartlet,"I don’t think I answered the last one. Suzanne’s got me telling jokes. Here’s an answer  to your question that I don’t think you’re going to like. A man once said this,  ""decisions are made by those who show up."" So are we failing you, or are you failing us?   A little of both. There’s a guy on my staff named Charlie Young, he showed  me a report from the Center of Policy Alternatives that says that 61% of you agree with  the statement ""The older generation has failed my generation"". When asked how the older  generation sees you, your top answers are ""lazy"", ""confused,"" and ""unfocused"". "
11755,josh,Center for Policy Alternatives. C.J. will have copies for you on the bus ride back. 
11756,bartlet,"If I take my jacket off, can I trust you all to read nothing more into it than I’ve been  talking for two hours and it’s a little hot under these lights? "
11757,c.j.,Follow me. 
11758,sam,Why? 
11759,sam,From who? 
11760,sam,Give it to me. 
11761,sam,Toby? 
11762,bartlet,"They’re telling me that we’re out of time. I just want to mention that at several points  during the evening, I was referred to as both a liberal and a populist, and a fellow  fourth from the back called me a socialist, which is nice, I haven’t heard that for a  while. "
11763,bartlet,"...and announced to the world that we were no longer subjects of King George III, but  rather a self-governing people. We hold these truths to be self-evident, they said,  that all men are created equal. Strange as it may seem, that was the first time in  history that anyone had bothered to write that down. Decisions are made by those who  show up. Class dismissed. Thank you, everyone. God bless you. And God bless America. "
11764,josh,Way to go. 
11765,bartlet,Toby! Walk with me. 
11766,toby,"Yes, sir? "
11767,bartlet,What have you got to say for yourself? 
11768,toby,About what? 
11769,toby," Yes, sir!  "
11770,bartlet,Get her again.
11771,bartlet,"Get her on the radio, please!"
11772,bartlet,Why can’t she talk?
11773,bartlet,Why the hell?
11774,bartlet,Why is she vomiting?
11775,bartlet,Ron...
11776,bartlet,Is Gina with her?
11777,bartlet,She’s not with her?
11778,bartlet,Why isn’t Gina in the car?
11779,bartlet,Is anybody dead back there?
11780,bartlet,What happened to your hand?!
11781,bartlet,"Oh God.  Coop, turn around, we gotta go to the hospital."
11782,bartlet,We’re going to the hospital! Let’s go!
11783,bartlet,"This is... my daughter is throwing up on the floor in the car behind us. You’re losing  blood by the liter, not to mention how many broken bones you got in your hand, but let’s  make sure that I’m tucked in bed before we do anything..."
11784,c.j.,I’m really fine.
11785,c.j.,I hit my head on the ground.
11786,c.j.,Somebody pulled me down.
11787,c.j.,Yeah!
11788,c.j.,It’s still Monday.
11789,c.j.,Is the President dead?
11790,sam,You all right?
11791,c.j.,What?
11792,sam,Are you all right?
11793,c.j.,"Yeah, where’s the President?"
11794,sam,"He’s on the way back to the White House, so is Zoey, they just put Leo in the car, you  all right?"
11795,c.j.,Somebody pulled me down.
11796,sam,Gina?
11797,toby,Josh! Josh! 
11798,toby,"Hey, Charlie, are you okay?"
11799,toby,Have you seen Josh?
11800,toby,"No, he didn’t. Shanahan got in with Leo. Josh didn’t get in the car."
11801,toby,Yeah. Stay right there.
11802,toby,Josh! Didn’t you hear me shouting for you? I didn’t know where the hell you... 
11803,toby,I need a... I need a doctor! I need help!
11806,bartlet,"I swear to God if I don’t speak to my daughter in the next five minutes, I’m gonna attack  someone."
11807,bartlet," This guy’s got about seven broken bones in his hand, by the way.  If somebody wants to give him an aspirin or something..."
11808,bartlet,"Listen, I want you to wait as long as you can before you give me the anesthesia. I need to  speak to Leo McGarry before you give me the anesthesia."
11809,bartlet,Well... I’ve been shot.
11810,bartlet,I’m okay.
11811,bartlet,They didn’t hit anything. They’re just gonna look around and make sure.
11812,bartlet,No.
11813,bartlet,"Yeah, ‘cause I want these guys to tell reporters that I was brave and joking around."
11814,bartlet," Honey, I’m fine. I’m just so happy to see you."
11815,bartlet,Mom’s gonna be pretty pissed.
11816,leo,"How you doing, kid?"
11817,bartlet,She booted all over the back of her car. You know they’re gonna bill me for that.
11818,leo,Yeah.
11819,bartlet,"Honey, do me a favor, will you?"
11820,bartlet,Tell her not to frighten the doctors. I’ll see you in a couple hours.
11821,bartlet,"I love you too, hon."
11822,bartlet,Anybody killed back there?
11823,leo,The two shooters. They got them through the window.
11824,bartlet,Anybody in the crowd?
11825,leo,There were some injuries. They’re coming right now.
11826,bartlet,What about our people?
11827,leo,"C.J. hit her head on the ground, but other than that..."
11828,bartlet, Get the cabinet together and the Security Council. Tell Jerome to suspend trading  on the stock exchange.
11829,leo,Yeah.
11830,bartlet,Do we know who the shooters were?
11831,leo,No.
11832,bartlet,I’m gonna be under anesthesia for a couple hours.
11833,leo,It’ll be fine.
11834,bartlet,"You know what I’m talking about, right?"
11835,leo,I’ll talk to Abbey.
11836,bartlet, Hey. Come here.
11837,bartlet,It’s okay.
11838,leo,"I’ll see you in a few hours, Mr. President."
11842,leo,Abbey. This is Dr. Keller.
11850,leo,You all right?
11851,leo,Was there someone on the ground?
11852,leo,Did they close the airports?
11853,leo,"You got the girl in the car, Gina."
11854,leo,Look...
11855,c.j.,It’s Josh!
11856,leo,Josh!
11857,leo,What happened?
11858,toby,He was behind us.
11859,sam,"Josh, I’m here!"
11860,josh,I shouldn’t be at this meeting.
11861,josh,Senator...
11862,leo,Tell me what’s happening!
11863,josh,I shouldn’t be at this meeting.
11864,josh,I need to get to New Hampshire.
11865,sam,You went to New Hampshire. We both did. You came and got me.
11866,josh,Yes.
11867,josh,"A few hundred times, sir."
11868,josh,"Of the 537 federal election officials, there are 30 who put their names on Social Security  reform legislation, and you’re one of them. Why not say so?"
11869,josh,"Mark, 400 billion dollars. Social Security represents one-fourth of the federal budget,  and it’s gonna be bankrupt in exactly 17 years. Right around the time you’re going to  check your mailbox, half of the elderly population will be living in poverty. This now,  qualifies as a priority, and running for President of the United States not putting Social  Security front and center is like running for President of the Walt Disney Corporation by  saying you’re gonna fix the rides at Epcot. "
11870,josh,Really? ‘Cause it’s what the rest of us call bull--
11871,josh,I don’t think the point of this is for me to have...
11872,josh,"Senator, you’re the prohibitive favorite to be the Democratic Party’s nominee for  President. You have 58 million dollars in war chest with no end in sight, and...  I don’t know what we’re for."
11873,josh,"I don’t know what we’re for, and I don’t know what we’re against. Except we seem to be  for winning and against somebody else winning."
11874,josh,Senator...
11875,leo,Josh.
11876,josh,Mr. Secretary!
11877,leo,I hope you don’t mind I didn’t make an appointment. I’m trying to fly under the radar  a little.
11878,josh,"Of course, I don’t mind, but the senator just went down for the 404 vote."
11879,leo,It’s probably the annual vote override to veto on the resolution to ship nuclear wastes  to Nevada.
11880,josh,Yeah.
11881,leo,It won’t pass.
11882,josh,No kidding.
11883,leo,"Actually, I came to see you."
11884,josh,Really?
11885,leo,Yeah.
11886,josh,What can I do for you?
11887,leo,You mind if we take a walk?
11888,josh,Sure.
11889,leo,I heard your dad was in the hospital again.
11890,josh,Yeah. They put... they got it all this time.
11891,leo,Is he taking it easy?
11892,josh,"No. He goes to the office at seven in the morning and goes home at eight every night.  On the weekends, he cleans the gutters and yells at the squirrels."
11893,leo,Why does he yell at the squirrels?
11894,josh,‘Cause they eat the seeds out of the bird feeder.
11895,leo,"You know, they make a thing now..."
11896,josh,"He knows, but he prefers to admonish them. But, listen, I-I need to get back to this  meeting."
11897,leo,"Josh, I’d like you to come to Nashua, New Hampshire Thursday night and hear Jed Bartlet  speak."
11898,josh,I work for Senator Hoynes.
11899,leo,Yeah.
11900,josh,Mr. Secretary...
11901,leo,"I’m not in the Cabinet anymore, Josh. Call me Leo."
11902,josh,"Look, Hoynes has the nomination sewn up."
11903,leo,Yeah.
11904,josh,"And if Bartlet’s looking to be Treasury Secretary or a slot at the Convention, this  really isn’t..."
11905,leo,Come to Nashua Thursday night.
11906,josh,Why?
11907,leo,Because that’s what sons do for old friends of their fathers. 
11908,josh,Mr. Secretary...
11909,leo,Leo. 
11910,josh,"Leo, the-the Democrats aren’t gonna nominate another liberal academic former governor  from New England. I mean, we’re dumb, but we’re not that dumb."
11911,leo, Nah. I think we’re exactly that dumb.
11912,josh," Yeah, uh, Janet. Uh, I need you to set up some plane tickets to New York.  Uh, probably to Boston too..."
11913,sam,Hmm?
11914,sam,"Uh, yeah. What Jack means is, if you were getting the tankers for a buck 85 and trading  stamps it would still be a bad deal if we didn’t limit your liability."
11915,sam,We did.
11916,sam,"The same way we do with any other asset acquisition. Create a separate corporation for  each one of them, then mortgage the boats, top to bottom."
11917,sam,I’m sorry?
11918,sam,"Mr. Cameron, you want me to buy the boats, you’re not asking me to be the first mate,  right?"
11919,sam,"You want to finance the tankers a hundred percent so that if litigation does penetrate  the liability shield we’ve set up for you there are no real assets at the end of the line,  just debt. You’re judgment proof. Let me run back to my office and get the tax figures  while David and Rita talk about IMO regulations. "
11920,sam,What’s his name?
11921,sam, Seriously?
11922,sam,Hey!
11923,josh,How you doing?
11924,sam,"Hey, you look fit."
11925,josh,You made partner?
11926,sam,"Next month. Listen, I’m hungry. You want to go grab a hot dog or something?"
11927,josh,It’s 9:30 in the morning.
11928,sam,"Yeah, they’ll be fresh. Come on."
11929,josh,Okay.
11930,josh,"Yeah, I was going to call before I came here, but then the strangest thing happened."
11931,sam,What?
11932,josh,I forgot the name of your firm.
11933,sam,Gage Whitney.
11934,josh,Yeah.
11935,sam,You couldn’t remember Gage Whitney.
11936,josh,I know.
11937,sam,Second biggest firm in New York?
11938,josh,I know.
11939,sam,Did the Shearson deal--
11940,josh,Yeah.
11941,sam,Bought Transcom.
11942,josh,"I really do know Gage Whitney. I’m saying, I’m just, um, I’m um, having a brain problem."
11943,sam,What are you doing in town?
11944,josh,I’m on my way to Nashua.
11945,sam,What’s in Nashua?
11946,josh,"Ah, a waste of time. Listen. You know why I’m here."
11947,sam,You want me to quit my job and come work for Hoynes?
11948,josh,"He’s gonna win, Sam."
11949,sam,So what do you need me for?
11950,josh,A better campaign. Come do some speech writing.
11951,sam,Lisa and I are getting married in September.
11952,josh, Ah.
11953,sam, Yeah.
11954,josh,"Okay. Listen, I should go, I got to go. I should let you--"
11955,sam,I got to get back to this thing.
11956,josh,It’s good seeing you.
11957,sam,It’s good seeing you. I miss you.
11958,josh,"Hey, congratulations on that partnership."
11959,sam,Josh! 
11960,sam,"Hoynes. He’s not the real thing, is he?"
11961,josh,"See, that-the thing you gotta know about Hoynes is-- "
11962,sam,It’s okay.
11963,josh,I-I’m saying--
11964,sam,Josh.  What are you doing?
11965,josh,I don’t know. What are you doing?
11966,sam,Protecting oil companies from litigation.
11967,sam,They’re our client. They don’t lose legal protection because they make a lot of money.
11968,josh,I can’t believe no one ever wrote a folk song about that. 
11969,josh,"If I see the real thing in Nashua, should I tell you about it?"
11970,sam,You won’t have to.
11971,josh,Why?
11972,sam,You’ve got a pretty bad poker face.
11973,josh,Okay.  Take it easy.
11974,sam,Okay.
11975,sam,I’m sorry.
11976,sam,I’m sorry. It’s just--
11984,leo,Thank you.
11985,leo,He’ll be out of surgery in about two hours. Fitzwallace is on a plane?
11986,leo,We’ve got him by phone?
11987,leo,Good evening.
11988,leo,Where’s the National Security Advisor?
11989,leo,"Nancy, you’ve seen the KH-10 pictures?"
11990,leo,And you know what they mean?
11991,leo,Jack.
11992,leo,I’ve seen them. I’m not worried about it.
11993,leo,The build-up isn’t sudden. They do it every couple of months.
11994,leo,The President is under general anesthesia right now. If he weren’t I’m sure he’d be  comforted to know that RDF can put Marines on the ground in 36 hours.
11995,leo,The Iraqi Republican guard can’t find their car keys in 36 hours.
11996,leo,"Jack, what’s the best way to get a message to Iraq?"
11997,leo,All right.
11999,c.j.,The President’s going to be fine.
12002,toby,He was shot--in the chest.
12003,c.j.,He’s in surgery right now.
12005,toby,"Yes, it’s critical. The bullet collapsed his lung and damaged a major artery."
12006,c.j.,"Leo’s gonna meet with the leadership in ten minutes. When he’s done, I’ll talk to  the press."
12007,c.j.,Yeah.
12008,c.j.,"Dr. Keller, the head surgeon, and Admiral Jarvis, the President's personal physician,  will be debriefing you in a few hours."
12009,c.j.,Danny!
12010,c.j.,No--
12011,c.j.,What?
12012,c.j.,I'll get back to you on that.
12013,c.j.,I'm sorry?
12014,c.j.,No.
12015,c.j.,I don't have anything for you on that.
12016,c.j.,I don't have anything for you on that either.
12017,c.j.,I don't believe the AP knows more than I do; I just believe they're willing to tell you  more.
12018,c.j.,One more question!
12019,c.j.,Arthur!
12020,c.j.,It's policy not to comment on security procedures.
12021,c.j.,I'm sorry?
12022,c.j., There'll be another briefing in an hour and a half. Hopefully we'll know more then.
12023,c.j., What's that supposed to mean since you can't answer my question?
12024,c.j.,What?
12025,c.j.,I lost my necklace. It must have come off when.
12026,c.j.,Somebody pushed me down.
12027,c.j.,What?
12028,c.j.,What was the question?
12029,c.j.,"The Vice President, the Secretary of State, the National Security Advisor, the Secretary  of Defense, one of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the White House Chief of Staff."
12030,c.j.,The Canadiens.
12031,c.j.,You understand I'm talking about the hockey team.
12032,c.j.,Just... give me a little time.
12033,leo,"Fitzwallace agrees with me, Nancy. Upgrade our DefCon posture and the whole world's gonna  wake up."
12034,leo,Counsel's office isn't sure he can do that.
12035,toby,Why not?
12036,leo,He never signed a letter.
12037,toby,What letter?
12038,toby,He's gotta sign a letter giving the Vice President power?
12039,toby,He's hemorrhaging and he's supposed to draft a memo?
12040,c.j.,I'm getting questions from Danny Concannon on it.
12041,c.j.,Let's assume I haven't.
12042,c.j.,And what does 'principal assistant' mean?
12043,toby,"Of course it wouldn't, 'cause that's an area of federal law where he'd want to have as  much ambiguity as possible."
12044,toby,Excuse me. 
12045,c.j.,I'm gonna go back to the hospital.
12046,leo,I'll be there in a little bit.
12047,toby,Try and hold Danny off for a few hours until the Counsel's office tells us where we are.
12048,c.j.,Okay.
12049,toby,You scratched your neck.
12050,c.j.,What?
12051,toby,Your neck.
12052,c.j.,"Yeah, it's where my necklace. Listen, Toby, I've been getting some questions about the  canopy the Secret Service used to use for outdoor entrances and exits."
12053,toby,Who asked you?
12054,c.j.,"It was. Arthur Leeds, then a couple of others stopped me."
12055,toby,Okay.
12056,c.j.,We don't comment on security procedures.
12057,toby,Yeah.
12058,c.j.,So I don't think I'll have to answer that question.
12059,toby,Yeah. 
12060,c.j.,Okay.
12061,toby,I'll see you at the hospital.
12062,c.j.,Yeah.
12063,toby,I need section 202 of the National Securities Act of 1947. 
12064,toby,Hey Ginger. I didn't know you were here.
12065,toby,It's okay.  Come here. 
12066,toby,It's okay. 
12067,toby,You all right?
12068,toby,Ready to go to work?
12069,toby,What?
12070,toby,Yeah.
12071,toby,Yeah.
12072,toby,"Yeah, we kept that secret pretty good. You know, he's speaking at the VFW hall tonight.  You should come."
12073,toby,There'll be free chicken.
12074,toby,Professional political operative.
12075,toby,"Well, there was a while back there when I was in elementary school."
12076,toby," Yes, I'm very good."
12077,toby,My record?
12078,toby,Altogether?
12079,toby,"Including city council, two Congressional elections, a senate race, a Gubernatorial  campaign, and a national campaign? "
12080,toby,...None.
12081,toby,You gotta be impressed with my consistency.
12082,toby,Sure.
12083,toby,Cause I'm about to get fired.
12084,toby,It was nice meeting you. 
12085,bartlet,"...Consumer price index, we tend to be late in responding to these trends, and we get  what doctors call a ""false positive"". The science of economics is a lot less an exact  science that we pretend. We build complex models with thousands of interdependent and  independent variables."
12086,toby,About what?
12087,toby,What question?
12088,toby,I don't know.
12089,toby,Yeah.
12090,toby,I don't know.
12091,toby,Yes.
12092,toby,Yes.
12093,toby,I have no new information since the last time you asked me that question.
12094,bartlet,"Let me put it another way: you and your husband pay $600 more every year than you would  if you were unmarried, living together, and filing individually. Couples living outside  the covenant of marriage do so."
12095,toby,"I asked him about his vote, he told me, I said then if he's asked about it tonight he  should and only because it's the easiest thing to remember, tell the truth."
12096,toby,"Not that much, but then I haven't had much to compare it to so..."
12097,bartlet,...which then again is a much larger tax on overstated real profits.
12098,bartlet,"You really didn't understand any of that, right?"
12099,bartlet,Me too. Yeah?
12100,bartlet," Yeah, I screwed you on that one."
12101,bartlet,I screwed you. You got hosed.
12102,bartlet,"And not just you. A lot of my constituents. I put the hammer to farms in Concord, Salem,  Laconia, and Elem."
12103,bartlet,You guys got rogered but good.
12104,bartlet,"Today, for the first time in history, one in five Americans living in poverty are children."
12105,bartlet,"One in five children live in the most abject, dangerous, hopeless, backbreaking, gut  wrenching, poverty, one in five, and they're children. If fidelity to freedom and  democracy is the code of our civic religion then surely, the code of our humanity is  faithful service to that unwritten commandment that says ""We shall give our children  better than we ourselves had."" I voted against the bill 'cause I didn't want it to be  hard for people to buy milk. I stopped some money from flowing into your pocket. If that  angers you, if you resent me, I completely respect that, but if you expect anything  different from the President of the United States, I suggest you vote for somebody else.  Thanks very much. Hope you enjoyed the chicken."
12107,leo,Mr. President?
12108,bartlet,I wanna see him.
12109,leo, Is he okay?
12111,bartlet,Please. Help me to the door.
12112,leo,You should stay in bed.
12113,bartlet,Charlie brought me some clothes. Please let me see him.
12115,bartlet,Great. 
12116,bartlet,What's next?
12117,bartlet,I understand.
12118,bartlet,"I understand the point that Cal was making. I was sitting next to him when he made it,  my ears are connected to my brain just like every body else. And I'm saying what's next?"
12119,bartlet,You're not afraid he's gonna make me look like I can't remember his name?
12120,bartlet,I am. I think it's going to make me look like I can't remember his name. I think it's  going to make me look addled. I think it's going to make me look dotty. And even if it  didn't make me look like those things it would remain a stupid idea. What's next? Nothing?  Excellent. 
12121,leo,"Okay, what's next?"
12122,leo,I think he did well. I would of liked to have seen more of those seats filled.
12123,leo,What're you talking about?
12124,toby,He's talking about the Governor's answer tonight.
12125,toby,I'm just guessing. I'm pretty drunk.
12126,leo,"Listen, I don't have time to make people comfortable. If a change has to be made, it has  to be made. Jerry, Cal, Mack, Steve -- you're fired."
12127,toby,What?
12128,leo,No kidding. It's moving day. I want Toby. The rest of you-- thanks very much. 
12129,leo,Fellas. Look at my face. You're done. 
12130,leo, Don't screw up.
12131,leo,Its freezing cold in October! I don't know how you people live here.
12132,bartlet,Did you just fire Cal Mathis?
12133,leo,Yeah.
12134,bartlet,You fired him.
12135,leo,"Yeah, and Jerry, and Mack, and Steve and the other guy."
12136,bartlet,Is there anyone you kept?
12137,leo,I kept Toby Ziegler.
12138,bartlet,"Oh, you kept Toby Ziegler, and you fired everyone else."
12139,leo,Yeah.
12140,bartlet,"Toby Ziegler is the only person working for us I don't know, and he's the one you kept!"
12141,leo,"Take him home, would you?"
12142,bartlet,Those were the only people I know.
12143,leo,Those people were worthless. It's time we bring in what we need.
12144,bartlet,So you made that decision on your own.
12145,leo,Yeah. You know why? ‘Cause you're a crappy politician. I think you'll find I'll be making  a lot of decisions on my own so get used to it.
12146,bartlet,You know I got elected to Congress by this state. This state sent me to Congress three  times and elected me Governor all without your help.
12147,bartlet,Don't start!
12148,leo,"No, seriously, that's a real political accomplishment, considering that your family  founded this state."
12149,bartlet,Hey.
12150,leo,Were you even opposed in any of those elections?
12151,bartlet,You got rid of all the people I know!
12152,leo,Yeah. Have a good night.
12153,bartlet,Why are you doing this? You're a player. You're bigger in the party than I am. Hoynes  would make you national chairman. Leo! Tell me this isn't one of the twelve steps.
12154,leo,"Yeah, that's what it is. Right after admitting we're powerless over alcohol and that a  higher power can restore us to sanity, that's where you come in."
12155,bartlet,Leo.
12156,leo,"Because I'm tired of it year after year after year after year having to chose between the  lesser of who cares? Of trying to get myself excited about a candidate who can speak in  complete sentences. Of setting the bar so low, I can hardly look at it. They say a good  man can't get elected President. I don't believe that, do you?"
12157,bartlet,And you think I'm that man.
12158,leo,Yes.
12159,bartlet,Does it matter that I'm not as sure?
12160,leo,"Nah. Act as if ye have faith and faith shall be given to you. Put it another way, fake it  till you make it. You did good tonight."
12161,bartlet,Yeah.
12162,leo,"This is the time of Jed Bartlet, old friend. You're gonna open your mouth and lift houses  off the ground. Whole houses, clear off the ground..."
12163,bartlet,Look what happened.
12164,c.j.,"We're confirming now that a suspect is in custody, and is being questioned by federal  law enforcement. At this time, we cannot, we are not releasing any information whatsoever  about the suspect."
12165,c.j.,"Yes, Steve, I can tell you those things, because when I said that we weren't releasing  any information whatsoever, I meant except than his name, his address, his ethnicity,  and what we think his motives are."
12166,c.j.,"I am releasing the name of Stephanie Abbott, A-B-B-O-T-T, from Silver Spring, Maryland,  who was in the crowd, and sustained an injury to the left femur, which is the thighbone. "
12167,c.j.,"The President remains in stable condition in the recovery room, and is expected to return  home Wednesday. Josh Lyman is in his sixth hour of surgery..."
12168,sam," Ma'am, does the President know they've arrested a suspect?"
12175,c.j., You got them on the phone?
12176,c.j., Guys?
12177,c.j.,"Sam, I need you to come back to the White House and speak to Nancy McNally about a letter  the President was supposed to sign. She'll know what you're talking about."
12178,sam,"Yeah, all right."
12179,c.j.,And Toby?
12180,toby,Yeah?
12181,c.j.,They're still asking about the tent.
12182,toby,Yeah.
12183,c.j.,"I'd be more comfortable with the ""no comment"" coming from the Secret Service, though... "
12184,sam, What's this?
12185,toby,They want to know why the President exited the building in the open air.
12186,sam, I'll talk to someone at Treasury.
12187,toby,I'll do it.
12188,sam,No.
12189,c.j.,"Well, someone."
12190,sam,"Toby, we were all in that meeting together."
12191,toby,Go back to the office.
12192,sam,Okay. Okay. 
12193,sam,"Actually. I have a thing. I have a thing I was going to mention, just a proposal to throw  out there. When I was a congressional aide, we had an expression, “no idea was too stupid  to say out loud,” so here it is, bear me out.  Instead of buying these ships? Don't  buy these ships. Buy other ships. Better ships. That's my idea."
12194,sam,And the good news is we have a no-penalty clause we can exercise if we pull out before  the First of December. 
12195,sam,"Well, there's a reason why they don't cost a lot of money. They're 20-year old single  hulled VLCCs that nobody wants. When they hit things, they will break. And they will  hit things, because they don't have state of the art navigation systems. They don't  have G3 tank gauging, or EM-5000 engine monitoring, the recommended staletronic, or  electopneumotronic ballast."
12196,sam,"I did. Strictly speaking, I did. But there's a broader liability to think about. People  drove past Exxon Stations after the Valdez."
12197,sam,"There's a Suez tanker ready to launch in the Koje Island shipyard in Korea. Chevron just  dropped the option, and it's sitting there in its cradle. Let's go get it."
12198,sam,"308,000 deadweight tons, carries 2.2 million gallons, and you can have it today for 46  million."
12199,sam,That's a good price!
12200,sam,I think I have an obligation. 
12201,sam,"Maybe they want to buy safer boats, but we never gave them the option."
12202,sam,Maybe they're really going to thank us for this suggestion.
12203,sam,Look...
12204,josh," Look, Operator, I'm looking for the number of a law firm in Manhattan.  Here's the thing, I can't quite remember the name of the firm... no, wait, wait, wait!  I just came back from New Hampshire, where I saw this guy and now I have to... look it's  a very famous firm that handles Shearson, you must know... okay, you know what, I'm just  going to - okay, bye. "
12205,sam,Hmm?
12206,sam, 11 million extra dollars.
12207,sam,"Money's going to be spent, Mr. Loch, you can spend it now, or you can spend it later,  but it's cheaper to spend it now."
12208,sam,And it's also the right thing to do. Spend 11 million extra dollars.
12209,sam,Spend it on a better boat.
12210,sam,"The Amoco Cadiz, 68 million gallons of crude oil off of Brittany, France. The Braer,  a Liberian Tanker 26 million gallons off the Shetland Islands. I just pulled these off  the internet last night! The Exxon Valdez. The Aegaen Sea. The Argo Merchant. Look it up!"
12211,sam,Spend an extra 11 million dollars!
12212,sam,You don't want to pay for it? Pass the expense on to us.
12213,sam,Half a penny at the tank. Here's five bucks. A thousand people are on me.
12214,sam,Yeah.
12215,sam,Yeah.
12216,sam,Yeah. 
12217,sam,Yeah! Yeah. 
12218,sam,I'm not going to need that.
12219,sam, New Hampshire!
12220,c.j.,Sam!
12221,sam,Yeah?
12222,c.j.,I wanted to see if...
12223,sam,How's your head?
12224,c.j.,"Oh, it's fine. I wanted to see if you talked to Nancy McNally."
12225,sam,"Yeah, and she talked to the Counsel's office, and they're going to work on a few things  and see what we like, but I got to tell you we're not going to --"
12226,c.j.,"Sam, you didn't happen to notice, when the shooting started, you didn't happen to notice  who pulled me to the ground, did you?"
12227,sam,No.
12228,c.j.,"They pulled me down behind the police car, and my necklace came off... "
12229,sam,No.
12230,c.j.,You talked to Nancy McNally?
12231,sam,Yeah.
12232,c.j.,Okay. 
12233,c.j.,Yeah.
12234,c.j.,Why?
12235,c.j.,"No, that's not a good --"
12236,c.j.,"No, I'm not doing any interviews just yet, I'm not doing it."
12237,c.j.,Which one of our people?
12238,c.j.,Yeah.
12239,c.j.,Somebody around here thought I should do the morning shows.
12240,c.j.,Who was in charge?
12241,c.j.,"Danny, it's a little complicated. There's something called the National Security Act of  1947. There's the 25th. Nancy McNally, the White House Counsel, Bill Hutchinson, they're  all working on it right now."
12242,c.j.,And we are working on that information.  We're working on it.
12243,c.j.,"Hello?  Isobel, it's 6:30 in the  morning! Yeah. "
12244,c.j.,"Good morning, Isobel. Hi, Roger. "
12245,c.j.,I'm sorry.
12246,c.j.,"It was 6:30 in the morning, Roger, I wasn't quite ready for work, but I am now. How can  I help you? "
12247,c.j.,I wasn't. Am I up for something? 
12248,c.j.,"Roger, I think we put together a very aggressive campaign."
12249,c.j.,That's two nominations more than a lot of people got.
12250,c.j.,The Hundred Most Powerful People in Hollywood.
12251,c.j.,"Yes, I am, and I can tell you that you're on it, and uh, congratulations, and it must,  you know, feel good being that powerful."
12252,c.j.,Eight?
12253,c.j.,"The movies were bad, Roger, all of them. Even the little kid was bad, but he was a little  kid, he had a couple of scenes, big eyeglasses, lisp, he's going to the Golden Globes.  You know why the New Coke marketing campaign failed? Because nobody liked New Coke.  The movies were bad. If the movies were unknown, I could help you, but they weren't.  They were just bad!"
12254,c.j.,"Sorry I talked to him like that, but did he really think he had ""The Maltese Falcon""  out there?"
12255,c.j.,"I'll apologize to him, Isobel. I'll find someone to make him Man of the Year. I'll ask  around in Vegas."
12256,c.j.,He's going to pull his business unless you fire me?
12257,c.j.,It is beneath me!
12258,c.j.,"So take me off Film and Television, I don't know anything about it, anyway! We have  plenty of accounts..."
12259,c.j.,You're firing me?
12260,c.j.,Out here in the hallway!?
12261,c.j., I need someone to call me a cab!
12262,c.j.,"I couldn't get my contacts in this morning, and I broke my glasses getting out of the  car. I can't drive myself home. I need someone to call me a cab."
12263,c.j.,"It was a bad movie, Isobel."
12264,c.j.,Hello?
12265,toby,"Hey, C.J."
12266,c.j.,Who is that?
12267,toby,It's me.
12268,c.j.,Toby?
12269,toby,Yeah.
12270,c.j.,What the hell are you --
12271,toby,"C.J., you fell into the pool, there."
12272,c.j.,I can't see!
12273,toby,"Yeah, well, maybe, kind of, uh, try to feel your way to dry land?"
12274,c.j.,Shut up! 
12275,c.j.,Avert your eyes!
12276,toby,What?
12277,c.j.,"I'm climbing out of the pool, my clothes will be clingy, avert your eyes!"
12278,toby," C.J., I really didn't come here --"
12279,c.j.,Avert your eyes!
12280,toby, Okay. 
12281,c.j.,"Oh, turn around. "
12282,toby,I tried calling you at your office. They said you were fired. Were you stealing things?
12283,c.j.,Roger Becker dropped from third most powerful person in Hollywood to ninth most powerful  person in Hollywood.
12284,toby,"Does he still make the playoffs, or is the cutoff line..."
12285,c.j.,They take it seriously.
12286,toby,"C.J., Jed Bartlet is very impressed with you. "
12287,toby,He likes the work that you did with that girl's group with the stupid name.
12288,c.j.,Emily's List?
12289,toby,Yes.
12290,c.j.,That girl's group with the stupid name?
12291,toby,Yes.
12292,c.j.,"Emily's List -- ""early money is like yeast""."
12293,toby,Yeah.
12294,c.j.,"""It helps raise the dough""."
12295,toby,I get it.
12296,c.j.,"They raise money for women candidates. “Early money is like yeast, it helps raise the  dough.” For the candidates."
12297,toby,I really do get it.
12298,c.j.,Bartlet's impressed with me?
12299,toby,Very impressed. And one of the big keys to his game plan is bringing you on as Press  Secretary.
12300,c.j.,"He's never heard of me, has he? "
12301,toby,No.
12302,c.j.,Toby... 
12303,toby,I'm here on instructions from Leo McGarry.
12304,c.j.,McGarry wants me.
12305,toby,Yes. Come join the campaign. 
12306,c.j.,How much does it pay?
12307,toby,How much were you making before? 
12308,c.j.,"$550,000 a year."
12309,toby,This pays $600 a week.
12310,c.j.,So this would be less.
12311,toby,Yes.
12312,c.j.,Toby. Does he know I've only ever worked statewide? Does he know I've never worked on a  national campaign before?
12313,toby,Yes. It's Graduation Day.
12314,c.j.,You really think I can do this? 
12315,toby,Yeah.
12316,c.j.,Is Jed Bartlet a good man?
12317,toby,Yeah.
12318,c.j.,Toby.
12319,toby,Yes.
12320,c.j.,"Then, let's go into the house so I can change my clothes and we can talk about it. "
12321,c.j.,Yeah?
12322,toby,House is over there.
12323,c.j.,Okay.
12325,bartlet,"We don't know what the injury count is, yet."
12327,bartlet,"Yeah. Charlie, the guy the Secret Service has in custody is named Carl Leroy. He gives  a statement in which he says that he and the two shooters were members of an organization  called West Virginia White Pride."
12329,bartlet,Go.
12330,bartlet," We don't know what the injury count is, yet."
12331,leo,"The President is going under general anesthesia, he usually signs a letter handing over  executive powers to the Vice President."
12332,leo,Nope. We blew that play.
12333,leo,"We'll see. To be honest with you, I don't really care right now."
12334,leo,Yeah.
12335,leo,You can sign the President's name?
12336,leo,On a document removing him from power and handing it to someone else.
12337,leo,I think the White House Counsel would say it was a coup d'etat!
12338,leo,I would think. 
12339,leo,And what the hell were you doing practicing the President's signature?
12340,leo,"We've got separation of powers, checks and balances, and Margaret vetoing things and  sending them back to the Hill."
12341,c.j.,"Leo, who thought it was a good idea for me to do the morning shows?"
12342,leo,I did.
12343,c.j.,Why?
12344,leo,"The President's not ready for cameras. If it's the Vice President, we're going to look  like we don't have a President, and I'd like the White House to start climbing out from  behind the bushes."
12345,c.j.,I think it's a bad idea.
12346,leo,Why?
12347,c.j.,"I just... First of all, I think it's inappropriate while Josh, you know, until --"
12348,leo,What's wrong?
12349,c.j.,Nothing.
12350,c.j.,"Nothing. I'd rather not do it, but obviously."
12351,leo,Have Sam do it.
12352,c.j.," Okay. Listen, the letter."
12353,leo,Yeah.
12354,c.j.,"The three and a half hours? I don't know how much longer I can dance around Danny, and  it's going to be Danny times a hundred by lunchtime."
12355,leo,Have him come see me.
12356,c.j.,Yeah?
12357,leo,Yeah.
12358,c.j.,Okay.
12359,leo,She doesn't want to do the morning shows.
12360,toby,She says she's been getting a couple of questions about why the President exited in  the open air. You remember the Secret Service usually constructs a tent or a canopy.  I'm going to talk to Ron Butterfield.
12361,leo,He's going to say the Secret Service doesn't comment on procedure.
12362,toby,"I know. But maybe I can talk him out of it. I should try, anyway."
12363,leo,"You don't have to, Toby."
12364,toby,"Yeah, I should, though."
12365,c.j.,"Okay, who can tell me what we did wrong there?"
12366,bartlet,I blew it. What's next?
12367,c.j.,"We didn't have the candidate. That's right. Anyone who answered ""we didn't have the  candidate"" -"
12368,bartlet,What's... next?
12369,josh,Toby wants to say something. 
12370,bartlet,Which one is Toby?
12371,toby,I am.
12372,bartlet, And which one are you?
12373,josh,I'm Josh.
12374,leo, What was it you wanted to say?
12375,toby,Let's get out of New Hampshire. 
12376,leo,Why?
12377,toby,Nothing to win here.
12378,sam,He's right.
12379,bartlet,The New Hampshire primary isn't held in New Hampshire anymore?
12380,toby,You can't win the New Hampshire primary.
12381,bartlet,I am going to win the New Hampshire primary.
12382,toby,Which is why you can't win it. 
12383,josh,You're incredibly popular in this state.
12384,sam,You're a democrat who was elected with 69 percent of the vote. That's unheard of.
12385,toby,"There's no way that you can exceed expectations, all you can hope for is an  ""as expected"", and there's always the possibility that you could embarrass yourself."
12386,bartlet,"I appreciate that, thanks. "
12387,josh,Toby meant in the polls.
12388,bartlet,I know what he meant.
12389,toby,"So, Hoynes will be in a fight with Wiley for a strong second place finish in  New Hampshire, meantime we're going to be in South Carolina, and we're going  to be the only ones there."
12390,bartlet,We're not going to beat Hoynes in South Carolina.
12391,toby,We don't have to beat Hoynes in South Carolina.
12392,c.j.,We just have to beat Wiley.
12393,bartlet, Wiley's going to drop out after South Carolina?
12394,leo,If he doesn't finish higher than third.
12395,bartlet,Are we going to get his endorsement?
12396,leo,"We're going to get his money, that's for sure."
12397,bartlet,It's for sure?
12398,leo,Josh thinks it is.
12399,bartlet,Which one is Josh?
12400,josh, I am. 
12401,bartlet,Okay.
12402,toby,"So, we finish second in South Carolina, we pick up some steam, some endorsements,  mostly some money, going into South Dakota, Vermont, Maine --"
12403,sam,"Where we come away with a split, maybe better, and now the prohibitive nominee for the  democratic candidate has lost 3 out of seven contests..."
12404,c.j.,And half the actual primaries - 
12405,sam,Leading into Super Tuesday.
12406,josh,Hoynes will take the South. We’ll take the North and the Pacific Northwest.
12407,toby,This race will be decided a week later in Illinois.
12408,c.j.,Illinois will be High Noon.
12409,leo,"Sam, if we win in Illinois, will we have a shot at California and New York?"
12410,sam,"If we win in Illinois, we're going to run the table."
12411,bartlet,"Well, that's it, then. And we saved people the trouble of voting. What's next?"
12412,josh,Our point is that it's --
12413,bartlet,"I understand the point. We're going to South Carolina to set up Illinois. When I ask,  ""What's next?"", it means that I'm ready to move on to other things. So, what's next?"
12414,leo,We're done.
12415,bartlet,Fantastic.
12416,josh,"Well, I feel bathed in the warm embrace of the candidate."
12417,leo,"He's very easy to like, once you get to know him."
12418,josh,How many people get that far? 
12419,leo,Not that many.
12420,josh,Okay.
12422,josh,Hi.
12424,josh,Who are you?
12426,josh,I'm Josh Lyman.
12428,josh,Yes.
12430,josh,Did I have an old assistant? 
12432,josh,Who are you?
12434,josh,Which woman?
12436,josh,You mean Margaret?
12438,josh,Who are you?
12440,josh,I'm going to talk to Margaret. 
12442,josh,Yeah?
12444,josh,Yeah?
12446,josh,Who are you?
12448,josh,When did your boyfriend break up with you?
12450,josh,"Well, you're too old for your parents to have kicked you out of the house."
12452,josh,Where did you graduate?
12454,josh,Where did you graduate?
12456,josh,Look --
12458,josh,From where?
12460,josh,You majored in Political Science and Government?
12462,josh,Uh-huh.
12464,josh,Okay.
12466,josh,You had five majors and two minors in four years?
12468,josh,"Okay, listen..."
12470,josh,Your boyfriend was older than you?
12472,josh,"Donna, you were just at my desk, reading my calendar, answering my phone, and hoping  that I wouldn't notice that I never hired you. Your boyfriend was older?"
12474,josh,Law student?
12476,josh,And the idea was that you'd drop out and pay the bills till he was done with his  residency.
12478,josh,And why did Dr. Freeloader break up with you.
12480,josh,"Donna, this is a campaign for the Presidency, and there's nothing I take more seriously  than that. This can't be a place where people come to find their confidence and start  over. "
12482,josh,I'm sorry?
12484,josh,Because --
12486,josh,"Donna, we're picking up today and going to South Carolina. If you want to stay in the  Manchester office - "
12488,josh,"I can't carry you, Donna! I got a lot of guys out there not making the trip."
12490,josh,With what?
12492,josh,Donna.
12494,josh,Go ahead.
12497,c.j.,"Hey, Spanky."
12498,sam,"Oh, God, what did I do?"
12499,c.j.,"Take a walk with me, would you? "
12500,c.j.,They're taking him off bypass now. 
12501,sam,"Yeah, I just heard. I'm going to head to the hospital."
12502,c.j.,You did well on the morning shows. 
12503,sam,Thanks.
12504,c.j.,I told Leo the reason I didn't want to do it was that it didn't feel right with Josh  still in surgery.
12505,sam,Yeah.
12506,c.j.,You know what the real reason was? 
12507,sam,The real reason?
12508,c.j.,Yeah.
12509,sam,No.
12510,c.j.,I think you do.
12511,sam,"Listen, C.J...."
12512,c.j.," The real reason I couldn't go on the morning shows and give  a first-hand account of what happened is that I couldn't remember what happened.  I remember walking out of the building, I remember somebody knocked me down, I know my  necklace came off, and I know a police car window exploded over my head. All night long,  I've been doing my press briefings using notes from other people's accounts. But it's  morning now, and after listening to you on the morning shows, I know what happened."
12513,c.j.,Sam. I think you have my necklace. 
12514,sam,"I didn't want you to feel beholden to me. I didn't want it to be like an episode of  ""I Dream of Jeannie"" where now you have to save my life..."
12515,c.j.,Sam.
12516,sam,"...the time-space continuum, where you have to follow me around with coconut oil and  hot towels..."
12517,c.j.,Coconut oil?
12518,sam,I'm just saying.
12519,c.j.,"Sam, I don't feel beholden to you. "
12520,sam,Why not? I saved your life.
12521,c.j.,Can I have my necklace back? 
12522,c.j.,Thank you.
12523,sam,I'll be in my office.
12524,c.j.,Sam?
12525,sam,Yeah.
12526,c.j.,Were you scared?
12527,sam, Yeah.
12528,c.j.,Me too. Thanks.
12529,toby,Ron.
12530,toby,"Pretty soon, yeah. Listen, can I talk to you for a minute?"
12531,toby,How's your hand?
12532,toby,You should be home.
12533,toby,C.J.'s starting to get some questions about why the President's exit wasn't covered in  Rosslyn.
12534,toby,"Yeah. Ron, a few weeks after the President was sworn in, you got a memo about his  protection."
12535,toby,"It said he wanted to enter and exit in the open air, and he didn't like the feeling of  traveling around in an armored tank."
12536,toby,"Specifically, it said he wouldn't use the tent or the canopy anymore."
12537,toby,"I wrote that memo, and the President signed it at my urging."
12538,toby,"Ron, I don't think it's right that the Secret Service get blamed for what happened last  night, I want the Treasury Department to hand over my memo to the Press. "
12539,toby,There are going to be a lot of questions.
12540,toby,Ron.
12541,toby,It's not right. You're the guys - look at your hand.
12542,toby,Your hand is not fine.
12543,toby,Let me go over there and tell them it was my fault.
12544,toby,Ron.
12545,toby,Okay. 
12546,toby,Good job last night.
12547,c.j.,"The Secret Service Agents carry a weapon called a .357 sig-hauer. The agents on the roof  shot the two men with .726 caliber rifles that are referred to as JAR, which believe it  or not, stands for ""Just Another Rifle"". They are made specifically and exclusively for  the Secret Service."
12548,leo,Shh.
12549,c.j.,"This is our 5th press briefing since midnight. Obviously, there's one story that going  dominating news around the world for the next few days, and it would be easy to think  that President Bartlet, Joshua Lyman, and Stephanie Abbott were the only victims of a gun  crime last night. They weren't. Mark Davis and Sheila Evans of Philadelphia were killed  by a gun last night. He was a Biology Teacher and she was a Nursing student. Tina Bishop  and Linda Larkin were killed with a gun last night. They were 12. There were 36 homicides  last night. 480 sexual assaults, 3,411 robberies, 3,685 aggravated assaults, all at  gunpoint. And if anyone thinks those crimes could have been prevented if the victims  themselves had been carrying guns, I'd only remind you that the President of the United  States himself was shot last night while surrounded by the best trained armed guards in  the history of the world. Back to the briefing."
12550,leo,"Yes, she is."
12551,leo,I'm going to the hospital. Why don't you ride with me?
12552,sam,"We're starting to get some good exit polling, at Stark County and Rock Island."
12553,leo,How good?
12554,sam,"We're running at 53 to 58 with the undecideds, from 72 hours ago, at the 12th,  14th and 15th."
12555,leo,That's the Money!
12556,sam,"DeWitt County, Cumberland!"
12557,josh,Yeah!
12558,leo,Who are you talking to?
12559,josh,I'm talking to nobody. There's no one at my house.
12560,leo,What's going on?
12561,josh,Nothing. My dad had his chemo today. These exit polls are going to cheer him up.
12562,leo,Sam said that we got the 72 hour undecideds in the 14th and 15th.
12564,leo,"Well, if there is, let's get rid of it."
12566,leo,Good exits from Stark County and Rock Island.
12568,leo,They're good.
12569,bartlet,What the hell is this?
12570,josh,That's Sam's draft of your victory remarks.
12571,bartlet,"""I congratulate my opponent on a well-fought campaign in Illinois""?"
12572,leo,You don't want to congratulate him?
12573,bartlet,"Yes, I want to congratulate him, but I'd like to call him by his name! Are we back to  this old crap again?"
12574,josh,"Governor, we just--"
12575,bartlet,"Leo, I want to go over this whole thing with you."
12576,leo,Excuse me. 
12578,josh,"Your husband's a real son of a bitch, Mrs. Bartlet."
12580,josh,"Well, I think that if he looked around, he'd see that nobody's handling him."
12582,josh,"Well, is he going to be ready? "
12584,sam,Toby.
12585,c.j.,Here it comes!
12586,josh, Yes!
12587,leo,"Hey, hey, hey! Way to go! Now, let's get to California."
12588,josh,"Leo, we've got to replace this music, we've got to replace it with some Doobie Brothers!"
12590,josh,"And Donna, you've got to get happy, Donna, you just won the Illinois Primary, come dance  with me!"
12592,bartlet,Josh?
12593,josh, Governor!
12594,bartlet,"Your father died, Josh. I can't believe it."
12595,josh,"Yeah, uh, Governor, you -- you shouldn't be here."
12596,bartlet,What happened? 
12597,josh,"He, uh, went for his chemotherapy and he unexpectedly developed a pulmonary embolism,  it's a --"
12598,bartlet,It's a blood clot.
12599,josh,Yeah. It went to his heart and there was cardiac arrest.
12600,bartlet,Yeah... Yeah.
12601,josh,"Governor, you should really get back to the ballroom, so that you can get on a plane and  get to California. "
12602,bartlet,He was a lawyer?
12603,josh,"Yeah, a litigator."
12604,bartlet,Did he like that you were in politics?
12605,josh,I think he would have liked grandchildren more.
12606,bartlet, He would've.
12607,josh,He liked that I was working for you. He liked that we were starting to do well.  He would've liked tonight. At least his friends and neighbors will be spared all the...  you know...  
12608,bartlet,He'd have been doing some bragging?
12609,josh,"Yeah, and your name wouldn't have come up, by the way. ""My son won the Illinois primary  tonight"". Three more hours, and he would have been able to say that. He'd have been proud."
12610,bartlet,"He was already. Trust me, Josh, I'm a father. He was already."
12611,josh,"I appreciate that, Governor. You should really get back to the hotel."
12612,bartlet,"Nah, I'm okay."
12613,josh,"Sir, not that I don't appreciate you coming down here, but there's a ballroom full of  people waiting for a victory speech."
12614,bartlet,They'll wait.
12615,josh,"Yeah, they will, but the people watching television won't."
12616,bartlet,"I've been a real jackass to you, Josh."
12617,josh,Well.
12618,bartlet,"To everybody. Toby Ziegler, C.J. Cregg, Sam Seaborn."
12619,josh,Yeah.
12620,bartlet,"Don't think I don't know what you gave up to work on this campaign, and don't think that  I don't know your value. And I'll never make you think I don't again. You got to be a  little impressed that I got all those names right just now. "
12621,josh,They're calling my flight. 
12622,bartlet,You want me to go with you? 
12623,josh, Go with me?
12624,bartlet,Maybe you want some company on the plane. 
12625,bartlet,I could get a ticket and come with you.
12626,josh,Governor! California. You have to go the ballroom and give a Victory speech in primetime  and go to California.
12627,bartlet,I guess you're right.
12628,josh," You guess I'm right? Listen to me, Governor, if you don't lose this election,  it isn't going to be because you didn't try hard enough. But it was nice of you to ask.  Thank you, I appreciate."
12629,bartlet,They're calling your flight. 
12630,leo,Is he going to be all right?
12631,bartlet,He's going to be fine.
12632,leo,Good.
12633,bartlet,Leo?
12634,leo,Yeah?
12635,bartlet,I'm ready.
12636,bartlet,"I couldn't hear you, Josh."
12637,leo,What did he say?
12638,bartlet,"He said, ""What's next?"""
12639,c.j.,The Theory of Everything?
12640,c.j.,Is it comprehensive?
12641,c.j.,"That was a joke there, pal-o-mine."
12642,c.j.,"Carol, I'm missing the OMB stats."
12643,c.j.,I'm not gonna lead with it.
12644,josh,"Yes, you are."
12645,josh,"So, you got it?"
12646,c.j.,Sure.
12647,josh,"I mean, you got what you're suppose to say."
12648,c.j.,He's making me crazy.
12649,josh,Say it for me.
12650,c.j.,"Joshua, I really have to get to the briefing room."
12651,josh,Say it please.
12652,c.j.,Psychics at Cal Tech and the FERMI National Accelerator Lab are close to announcing what...
12653,josh,Physicists! Theoretical physicists at Cal Tech...
12654,c.j.,Not psychics?
12655,c.j.,I should jot that down.
12656,josh,Please.
12657,c.j.,I tell you if it was psychics I'd lead with it. 
12658,c.j.,Talk to you later mi amor. 
12659,c.j.,Thank you. You can set 'em down and let JOSH rant a little before you hang up the phone.
12660,c.j.,"Yes, ma'am."
12661,toby,The Bureau of Labor Statistics is going to report that the CPI jump 0.7%...
12662,c.j.,Okay...
12663,toby,...is the biggest one month increase since the Bureau began tracking prices in '52.
12664,c.j.,"All right, let me say this, the market basket used to calculate the CPI is antiquated. "
12665,toby,Say outdated.
12666,c.j.,And doesn't include some regular house hold items...
12667,toby,Yes.
12668,c.j.,...like computers...
12669,toby,The prices are always dropping...
12670,c.j.,Yes.
12671,toby,"...and doesn't reflect significant technical improvements like airbags in automobiles, which  increase the price of the car very slightly, but provide a much greater value to the consumer.  You got all that? "
12672,c.j.,Let's find out.
12673,c.j.,Leopold.
12674,leo,Mention the HUD secretary is announcing changes in the underwriting criteria for the Federal  Housing Administration.
12675,c.j.,"Well, the network's gonna want to break in with special coverage for that."
12676,leo,The adjustments are in FHA related lending.
12677,c.j.,"Seriously, they're going to need time to put together a logo and theme music."
12678,leo,You know the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported...
12679,c.j.,Reported the CPI jumped by 0.7%.
12680,leo,Thank you. 
12681,c.j.,"Oh, Holy Interruptus, Batman!"
12682,sam,Grant Samuels died.
12683,c.j.,Really?
12684,sam,Yes.
12685,c.j.,He's really dead this time?
12686,sam,Yeah.
12687,c.j.,Cause last time you told me he was dead and he wasn't.
12688,sam,He's dead this time.
12689,c.j.,Somebody poked him a little to see...
12690,sam,"He died, C.J.!"
12691,c.j.,"Well, okay, then I shouldn't have made a joke."
12692,sam,I'm almost certain he's dead.
12693,c.j.,Sam!
12694,sam,"I was making a joke, too! What, you work alone?"
12695,c.j.,Give me some...
12696,sam,"He's survived by his wife, Eileen, his son, Robert, his two daughters, Priscilla and Patty,  and eight grandchildren."
12697,c.j.,I'm not going to learn their names.
12698,sam,Uh...that's fine.
12699,c.j.,"Eileen, Robert, Priscilla, Patty, and eight grandchildren. And I'm assuming it was  complications due to... "
12700,sam,Uh... yeah.
12701,c.j.,You know anything about Theoretical Physics?
12702,sam,Ah... The Grand Unified Theory.
12703,c.j.,You know anything about it?
12704,sam,No.
12705,c.j.,Okay.
12706,c.j.,"Good morning everybody. I have to start with a sad announcement. Congressman Grant Samuels  finally succumbed to pneumonia last night. His wife, Eileen, his son, Robert, his daughters,  Priscilla and Patty, and his eight grandchildren are all in the President's thoughts today.  I also want to talk this morning about the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Federal Housing  Administration. "
12707,c.j.,"And as a special treat for our friend, Josh Lyman, who's recovering very nicely at G.W.  The President's science advisors is telling us that psychics at Cal Tech and the Fermi  National Accelerator Lab....."
12708,toby,81%
12709,sam,Those numbers are soft.
12710,c.j.,(sarcastically) Do you think?
12711,sam,You don't?
12712,c.j.,"A week ago the job approval's at 51. We get shot at and it's at 81. Yeah, I think the numbers  are soft."
12713,toby,Still... 81%.
12714,bartlet,"Good morning, everybody. Anybody know what the word 'acalculia' means?"
12715,sam,"It's the inability to form arithmetic functions. I'm sorry, Mr. President. You wanted to  answer your own question, didn't you?"
12716,bartlet,"Yeah, but I'll get over it. "
12717,sam,"Good for you, sir. That's very mature."
12718,bartlet,Shut up.
12719,sam,"You're not over it yet, are ya?"
12720,bartlet,No.
12721,sam,Okay. 
12722,leo,Did we really poll at 81%?
12723,c.j.,"Those aren't internals. It's CNN, USA Today."
12724,toby,It's soft.
12725,leo,(mock surprise) No!
12726,sam,"When asked ""whose approach on important national problems do you think is generally best,  President Bartlet or the Republican leaders of Congress?"" Bartlet gets 61%."
12727,bartlet,Well 19% of the country has clearly made up their minds about me; 20% just feel sorry for me.  This is what you want if you're the leader of the free world. Give us an over view. 
12728,leo,Where should we be looking?
12729,c.j.,They're not going to elect a democrat in the Florida 9th.
12730,leo,"They're not going to elect a democrat there, either. But let's put some time into it.  What else?"
12731,c.j.,"Since you brought up Cumberland and Monroe, can I say a word about the shooting?  (beat) It's been a week and the honeymoon's about to be over."
12732,sam,She's right.
12733,c.j.,We want to be sure it doesn't look like we're taking advantage of the situation.
12734,toby,Why not?
12735,c.j.,"Why not, what?"
12736,toby,The entire country was the victim of domestic terrorism. Why not use the soft numbers before  they disappear and go after the guns and go after the hate groups?
12737,c.j.,It doesn't look good.
12738,toby,Looks good to me.
12739,c.j.,"Well, you work for the White House, Toby. I think we were counting on your support, either way."
12740,toby,Mr. President...
12741,bartlet,"C.J., if you get questions about the midterms, say ""we haven't thought that far ahead due to  recent events."""
12742,leo,"Oh, and when they ask about the linkage between the approval numbers and the shooting,  ""the President's deeply gratified by the publics' support but eager to focus on the issues."""
12743,toby,Which will be....
12744,bartlet,"I'll let you know. Thank you very much, everyone."
12745,bartlet,(reads the note) It's fine. Tell them around 3 o'clock.
12746,bartlet,Was Zoey out there?
12747,bartlet,Is she still here?
12748,bartlet,Okay.  Leo.
12749,leo,"Yes, sir."
12750,bartlet,Did you know Elliot Roush is running to for the school board in Manchester?
12751,leo,"I didn't sir, but then, I don't know who Elliot Roush is..."
12752,bartlet,Elliot Roush.
12753,leo,Yes.
12754,bartlet,My Elliot Roush.
12755,leo,"I'm sorry sir, but I'm still not..."
12756,bartlet,I beat him in my first Congressional campaign.
12757,leo,I can't believe I didn't commit that piece of arcane information to memory.
12758,bartlet,I want some polling numbers on that race.
12759,leo,I don't want you focusing your attention on the school board race in New Hampshire. 
12760,bartlet,"Yeah, 'cause looking at two numbers on a piece of paper really takes the life out of me."
12761,leo,I know where this is going...
12762,bartlet,Get me the numbers. Let me tell you something...
12763,leo,No.
12764,bartlet,...I'm ready to go out there.
12765,leo,No.
12766,bartlet,I don't need to wait another week.
12767,leo,"Sir, let's play a game of ""Who do you think I'm going to agree with?"" Fourteen doctors say  you should wait another week before you assume a campaign schedule. Who do you think I'm  going to agree with? "
12768,bartlet,Get away from me.
12769,leo,"Yes, sir."
12770,sam,Is he here?
12771,sam,Ah... I'll go get him myself.
12772,sam,Tom.
12773,sam,I hope you weren't waiting too long. 
12774,sam,It's nice to meet you. You got married.
12775,sam,(to Sarah) Is it his?
12776,sam,"Okay, follow me. "
12777,sam,Tom and I had a contracts professor at Duke who couldn't stand me.
12778,sam,"If he knew how many times I wanted to tell him to take the law and shove it up his...  Hey, have you guys been to the White House?"
12779,sam,"Ah...Well, that's my office over there. (points to his area)  And the President works in that round room over there. (points toward the Oval Office)  And nobody else really matters. Come on in."
12780,sam,This is the Mural Room.
12781,sam,It's called the Mural room. Have a seat. Do you know why I wanted to talk to you?
12782,sam,'Cause the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee asked me to.  (beat) Grant Samuels died a few days ago.
12783,sam,"He wasn't going to be running again anyways, 'cause he was pretty sick and the man who was  going to be running in his place..."
12784,sam,"Right, isn't going to..."
12785,sam,"Tom, you are a phenomenally attractive Democratic candidate for that district. There are  162 games in major league baseball season and the players have a saying ""Every team's going  to win 54 games, every team's going to lose 54, it's what you do with the other 54 games that  counts."" In your district, you got democrats, you got republicans, and the other 54 games  are women. Specifically young mothers, among who the number one issue is crime. You are a  graduate of Oberlin and Duke Law School. You passed up many lucrative opportunities to work  in the D.A's office. You are a prosecutor with an exceptional conviction record and certainly  nobody can hang ""soft on crime"" around your neck. You're active in local politics. You're  personable. You are articulate and energetic. You are married and you're having a baby."
12786,sam,I'm sorry?
12787,sam,"Sarah, there's very little information about your husband that I don't have. And tell your  mom happy birthday for me."
12788,sam,"Tom, you'll have the full weight of the Democratic National Committee, the Congressional  Campaign Committee, the Minority leader, whom we hope to make the majority leader, and the  President of the United States. What do you say? You want to run for Congress?"
12789,sam,Five minutes. I'll be outside. 
12790,c.j.,You're pissed at me?
12791,toby,"I'm saying, I could've used your support in there."
12792,c.j.,You get my support the same way I get yours. When I agree with what you're saying or when I  don't care about what you're saying. This time I disagree.
12793,toby,You don't think we should use the moment to get aggressive about guns and hate groups?
12794,c.j.,I think we were victims of a violent crime and it's unseemly to use this moment at all.
12795,toby,"We didn't get the country drunk, C.J. We're not taking advantage of anybody, and even if we  were, who cares?"
12796,c.j.,Every Republican spending the next 12 weeks trying to keep control of the House.
12797,c.j.,"Toby! If you and the FBI want to go after hate groups, I'm not the one you have to convince.  Go bag the President. "
12798,toby,I will.
12799,c.j.,I've gotten a lot of calls about pieces people want to do on how staffers are handling the  shooting and the aftermath.
12800,toby,Psychologically?
12801,c.j.,Yeah. I don't think it's a good idea. Do you?
12802,toby,We're not the story.
12803,c.j.,That's what I'm saying.
12804,toby,Leave me alone.
12805,toby,"(to himself) I got it. I got it. I got it. (beat) I got it. Bonnie, Ginger, I got it."
12806,toby,Sam! 
12807,toby,Sam.
12808,toby,Sam?
12809,sam,I'm right here.
12810,toby," Oh, I thought you were in there."
12811,sam,I wasn't.
12812,toby,I got it.
12813,sam,Got what?
12814,toby,How to avoid the appearance that we're randomly and generically going after extremist groups  in violation of their civil liberties.
12815,sam,We can avoid that appearance by not doing it.
12816,toby,"Yes, or with this. The shooting was the action of not one, but at least three card carrying  members of West Virginia White Pride."
12817,sam,They have cards?
12818,toby,What?
12819,sam,They actually have membership cards?
12820,toby,"What the hell? No, Sam, it was an expression."
12821,sam,Okay.
12822,toby,"The key phrase is ""at least"", at least three members. There might be more. We don't know."
12823,sam,"So, therefore, FBI has grounds to investigate..."
12824,toby,"Yes, to investigate or curtail the activities of all extremist organizations...."
12825,sam,...under a cover of investigating this one particular crime.
12826,toby,How do we know that whatever young Nazis of Delaware weren't co-conspirators?
12827,sam,"It's not an uncommon way to get around the Bill of Rights, Toby. I'm surprised it took you  three weeks to come up with it. "
12828,toby,"Possibly, because, I had no help from anyone else who works in this building."
12829,sam,Toby.
12830,toby,I'm taking it to Leo.
12831,sam,Knock yourself out. (walks off)
12832,toby,Donna.
12834,toby,You going to see Josh?
12836,toby,Can I come?
12838,toby,Listen...
12840,toby,Donna.
12842,toby,The rules are dumb.
12844,toby,"Donna, seriously."
12846,toby,Fartoost. Don't bring the Yiddish unless you know what you're doing.
12848,toby,Donna
12850,toby,Thank you.
12852,toby,I need to talk to him about...
12854,toby,And I'd like to go to his apartment and talk to him.
12856,toby,Donna.
12858,toby,Yeah.
12859,leo,"Hey, kid."
12860,leo,He's making campaign calls.
12861,leo,He's making them from the residence.
12862,leo,"You're father has a very strict interpretation of something called the Pendleton Act,  which prohibits campaign donations to be solicited on government property. "
12863,leo,Exactly.
12864,leo,Yes.
12865,leo,"Because your father is a demented, demented man. I'm going over there. "
12866,leo,No.
12867,c.j.,Sir...
12868,bartlet,46%.
12869,c.j.,"Yes, sir."
12870,bartlet,The guy is polling at 46%.
12871,c.j.,I didn't think they had polling data on people running for seats on the Board of Education.
12872,bartlet,They didn't. I had to have our guys do it.
12873,c.j.,"Sir, do you think you're becoming obsessed with this race?"
12874,bartlet,He's polling at 46%. He's not a joke. He's polling inside the margin.
12875,c.j.,"In a race for the Board of Education, in a school district that has 43 kids."
12876,bartlet,"It has 1100 kids, and you don't take these people seriously 'cause they don't get anywhere  nationally, but they don't have to. All they have to do is, bit by little bit, get themselves  on the Boards of Education and city councils. 'Cause that's where all the governing that  really matters to anybody really happens."
12877,c.j.,"We do a little governing here, Mr. President."
12878,bartlet,I'm on hold with a guy whose name I've got on an index card. How much governing do you think  is going on around here today? And can you believe I'm on hold?
12879,c.j.,"You're not, sir. You finished the call."
12880,bartlet,I did?
12881,c.j.,"Yes, sir."
12882,bartlet,How'd it go?
12883,c.j.,Very well.
12884,leo,"Good morning, Mr. President."
12885,bartlet,Elliot Roush is now polling at 46%.
12886,leo,How do you know?
12887,bartlet,I had our people...
12888,leo,You had our people check.
12889,bartlet, I have 3 daughters who grew up in that school district.
12890,leo,Leave Elliot Roush alone. You beat him already.
12891,bartlet,"And he has come back. Like crab grass pulled from the lawn. Not by the root, but by the  other thing."
12892,leo,I stopped by to see how the calls are going.
12893,bartlet,They're going fine.
12894,leo,Then I'll leave.
12895,bartlet,Can't tell you how much I'm going to miss you. (to Zoey) You wanted to talk to me?
12896,bartlet,"(big sigh) This is real and a man, who makes the Spanish Inquisition look like a Barbara  Walters Special, is now polling at 46% in your school district, for which I have personally  baked things to raise money. (to C.J.) You can go, too."
12897,c.j.,You baked things? 
12898,bartlet,(sternly) You can go.
12899,c.j.,"(more seriously) Thank you, Mr. President."
12900,bartlet,What do you want?
12901,c.j.,The calls are going well.
12902,leo,Good.
12903,c.j.,"Listen, Leo, we're still asked to participate in aftermath stories."
12904,leo,Psychological effects?
12905,c.j.,Yeah and I was wondering....
12906,leo,Don't do it.
12907,c.j.,"No, I know that. But I was wondering..."
12908,leo,You're wondering what?
12909,c.j.,This isn't going to be good.
12910,leo,You were wondering what?
12911,c.j.,Don't worry about it.
12912,leo,Okay. (leaves)
12913,c.j.,"(into phone) Hey, it's C.J. Cregg."
12914,toby,Step 3: Public disclosure of membership and contributor rolls for all organizations on the  Attorney General's list of hate groups. This allows for the American public to know who their  people are and where their funding is coming from.
12915,sam,"Yes, and to do it in blatant violation of their right to free association."
12916,toby,Sam.
12917,sam,"You know, laws like this were passed in the south during the Civil Rights movement to root  out members of such terrorist organizations as the NAACP."
12918,toby,I knew you were going to say that.
12919,sam,"Yes, you did. By the way, the Supreme Court struck down those laws as unconstitutional."
12920,toby,"That was an ultra-activist Warren Court that struck down those laws and I think they'd see it  differently, today."
12921,sam,"Toby, you're an.... you're an activist!"
12922,toby,"And I was shot at and so I am acting, right now!"
12923,c.j., Sam.
12924,sam,He wants everyone to have to register affiliation with the FBI.
12925,c.j.,Any problems with the first Amendment?
12926,toby,I'll get around them. 
12927,c.j.,I need to talk to you.
12928,sam,What's up?
12929,c.j.,There's a problem with your friend.
12930,sam,Which friend?
12931,c.j.,"Tom Jordan, the guy you got running."
12932,sam,What's the problem?
12933,c.j.,His prosecutorial record.
12934,sam,His prosecutorial record is great.
12935,c.j.,Not during jury selection. 
12936,sam,Preemptive challenges?
12937,c.j.,Your friend likes white jurists for his black defendants.
12938,sam,"He's a prosecutor, C.J."
12939,c.j.,"Not anymore. Now he's a politician and this needs a save. So, get into it, would you?"
12940,sam,Yeah. 
12941,bartlet,Do we know how Tokyo opened?
12942,bartlet,Is that it for me?
12943,bartlet,Wyman? 
12944,bartlet,Frank Gates and McNamara?
12945,bartlet,Those are campaign calls.
12946,bartlet,"Because I choose not to, Charlie. Because, however an empty gesture it may seem, I would  like to take some executive notice of the notion that it's probably not a good idea for the  most powerful and influential person in the world to be calling up the people whose laws  he signs and asking them for money! (beat) I'm going to do it, but not behind this desk  and not in this room. What else?"
12947,bartlet,Yeah. (takes the phone messages) I'll make these calls from the Residence. Tell C.J. I want  to see her in an hour. 
12948,sam,"Hey, man."
12949,sam,Leo. (taps lightly on Leo’s door frame)
12950,leo,"Oh Sam, come in. Close the door."
12951,sam,What's going on?
12952,leo,Josh is on the speaker.
12953,sam,What's going on?
12954,leo,A guy who went to college with Tom Jordan says he belonged to an all white fraternity.  The local papers are gonna carry it tomorrow.
12955,sam,"Yeah. I checked that out weeks ago. It wasn't an exclusive fraternity, they just didn't  happen to have any black pledges."
12956,leo,"Yeah, but you put this together with the preemptive challenges in voir dire and serious  leaders in the African-American community have a problem. "
12957,sam,I'll talk to him.
12958,leo,Nah.
12959,sam,Leo.
12960,leo,"No, it's over, Sam. I'm going to..."
12961,sam,No.
12962,leo,I'm going to cancel....
12963,sam,No!
12964,leo,The President's stop and shut down the money.
12965,sam,"You can't cut and run, Leo."
12966,sam,Of course we have a choice.
12967,josh,We got a chance at the House. We've only got 3 weeks left. Leo’s got to put the President  and the money where the President and money can win. 
12968,sam,Tom Jordan is running against the man...
12969,leo,"Well, you don't have to tell me."
12970,sam,You're going to hand it to him 
12971,josh,Which will matter less if we get back the house.
12972,leo,Jordan is down by 7 and he's not going to come back from this.
12973,josh,"Not only that, we stand by him, this is a national thing. It could drag down black turn out  in districts where we're competitive."
12974,sam,I told him....
12975,leo,Yeah.
12976,sam,I told him we would stand by him. I told him he would have our full support. I was the one  who asked him to run. I was asked to ask him. 
12977,leo,I know.
12978,sam,"We walk away now, that's it. He's a racist! The White House just said so!"
12979,leo,"We can't afford all the things we want, Sam. It's over."
12980,leo,How did that bullet not kill you?
12981,josh,"Just lucky, I guess."
12982,leo,Yeah. 
12983,c.j.,Toby.
12984,toby,(without looking up) Yeah. 
12985,c.j.,Any chance I can see an advanced copy of the President's remark for the Asia Pacific?
12986,toby,Um... what?
12987,c.j.,Asia Pacific.
12988,toby,I have a draft here. I'm going to rewrite it.
12989,c.j.,I thought I was going to have it by the end of the day.
12990,toby,The day's not over yet.
12991,c.j.,"You know, Toby. These pieces everyone wants to do on the psychological aftermath of the  shooting for the White House staff, they had me thinking. Do you think there might be a  psychological aftermath and we're not paying attention to it?"
12992,toby,"C.J., I really don't have time to have this conversation."
12993,c.j.,"I'm saying, I think you should have this conversation with somebody."
12994,toby,You think my problem is psychological?
12995,toby,That's crap.
12996,c.j.,...So you can behave like the Director of the FBI.
12997,toby,"Well, I'm waiting for the Director of FBI to behave that way."
12998,c.j.,Toby.
12999,toby,I'm waiting for the Justice department to behave that way. I'm waiting for Congress to  behave that way. 
13000,toby,I'm waiting for the White House to behave that way!
13001,c.j.,You want to lock up everybody with a white sheet?
13002,toby,"Yes, I do. Yes, I do. Who has a problem with that? Bring 'em to me, right now. YES I DO!"
13003,c.j.,He's ready for me?
13004,c.j.,Thank you.
13005,c.j.,"I'll be here for a while, so... whenever you can get me Asia Pacific."
13006,toby,Give me an hour.
13007,bartlet,Come in.
13008,c.j.," Good evening, Mr. President. "
13009,bartlet,"Hi, C.J."
13010,c.j.,Charlie said you wanted to see me.
13011,bartlet,Yeah. Why has there been no press mentioned that the fact that Elliot Roush was an opponent  of mine in New Hampshire?
13012,c.j.,Elliot Roush is the man....?
13013,bartlet,He's running for a seat on the school board up in New Hampshire.
13014,c.j.,"Yes, sir. I'm sure it's gotten some local coverage. I can have the news office run...."
13015,bartlet,Why isn't it more than local?
13016,c.j.,It's a school board seat.
13017,bartlet,It's a human interest story.
13018,c.j.,Not a very interesting one.
13019,bartlet,"I'm saying, if anyone in the Press Room wanted to do this story that I would comment on the  record."
13020,c.j.,"Sir, the President can't publicly take sides in a local school board election."
13021,bartlet,Why can't he?
13022,c.j.,"Because it's not done, and it's not fair. It's personal and it's irresponsible. It will  galvanize the Republicans and the Democrats in Congress will think you've abandoned them,  that you don't care about winning back the House. "
13023,bartlet,I don't care about winning back the House.
13024,c.j.,Mr. President...
13025,bartlet,I don't care about winning back the House!
13026,c.j.,"Well, I don't believe that's true so let's just keep that between you and me."
13027,bartlet,"C.J., I've known men of faith in my life. Towering men. Men of wisdom and compassion.  Men of all faiths, of healing and peace. Pro choices, pro-life, Republican, Democrat,  men and women of God. Elliot Roush... (long beat) ...is polling at 53%. He's polling  at 53%. He's the front runner."
13028,c.j.,"Then that's the way it is. In a democracy, oftentimes, the other people win."
13029,bartlet,"Yeah. It was just a thought, but I mean, obviously, you're right."
13030,c.j.,"Yes, sir."
13031,bartlet,Thanks.
13032,c.j.,"Thank you, Mr. President."
13033,sam,Ginger!
13034,sam,All twelve?
13035,sam,"Hey, give me somebody in the Midwest, would ya? (speaking to a room full of people)  I want to see everyone on telephones. "
13036,sam,"Okay, good...just like that."
13037,sam,"God...Tom, Sarah... I'm sorry. I forgot, I was... I'm sorry, I'm late. I'm glad you could  make it."
13038,sam,"Yeah, you've seen the exits. You're going to lose, Tom."
13039,sam,Probably 58-42.
13040,sam,42% is a very respectable number.
13041,sam,"Well, we'll get them next time."
13042,sam,That's how we do it.
13043,sam,Good luck with the baby.
13044,c.j.,(waking up a bit) Stern.
13045,c.j.,Isn't Don Imus in this 70's?
13046,c.j.," How are you ""Dave in the Morning"" before he was ""Imus in the Morning?"""
13047,c.j.,"Okay. Fellas, I'm sorry, but it's Election Day and I need to check in with the exit polls..."
13048,c.j.,...and what not. Good meeting you both.
13049,c.j.,Who's that?
13050,c.j.,That's Jenna Jacobs?
13051,c.j., What's the latest?
13052,c.j.,I'm gonna go check.
13053,toby,"Good evening, Mr. President."
13054,bartlet,"Toby, I'm drinking the most fantastic thing I've ever tasted in my life: chocolate syrup,  cold milk, and seltzer. I know it sounds terrible, but trust me, I don't know where this  has been all my life."
13055,toby,"It's called an egg cream, Mr. President. We invented it in Brooklyn."
13056,bartlet,In Brooklyn.
13057,toby,"Yes, sir."
13058,bartlet,Not New England?
13059,toby,"There are some good things in this world not from New England, sir."
13060,bartlet,"Toby, don't ever let me hear you say that again."
13061,toby,"Yes, sir."
13062,bartlet,What's on your mind?
13063,toby,"Mr. President, I was thinking... I was thinking it might..."
13064,bartlet,You want to take a leave of absence.
13065,toby,"I was thinking I might need some time off, yes sir."
13066,bartlet,"That's no problem, Toby."
13067,toby,Okay.
13068,bartlet,Not a problem at all.
13069,toby,"Thank you, sir. "
13070,bartlet,15 minutes. 
13071,bartlet,"It's time to get up off the mat, Toby."
13072,toby,"Sir, what's to wrong with having the Attorney General designate potentially..."
13073,bartlet,Toby.
13074,toby,"...dangerous organizations that promote violent acts? I... I... understand it's problematic.  Ah... uh... there'd be no judicial review, or legislative oversight, or even for that matter  legal finding of fact, but... (big sigh) Okay... fine... fine... (choked up with emotion)  Why does it feel like this? I've seen shootings before."
13075,bartlet," It wasn't a shooting, Toby. It was a lynching. They tried to lynch  Charlie right in front of our eyes, can you believe that?"
13076,toby,What's this?
13077,bartlet,"Keyhole satellite photographs. It's the headquarters for West Virginia White Pride  headquarters. It's a diner outside Blacksberg. Every night for the past 12 weeks,  I've picked up the phone and called the Attorney General, fully prepared to say two  wordstake 'em. And then I hang up the phone because I know it'll be better tomorrow  and better the day after that. We saw a lynching, Toby. That's why it feels like this."
13078,toby,I'm not sure I'm going to come out of the other side of this. 
13079,bartlet,"I'm not sure I can either. But until we are sure, I think we should keep coming into work  every day. "
13080,toby,How's it going with your school board guy?
13081,bartlet,"Yeah, he's gonna win."
13082,toby,"When you ran against him, how'd you beat him?"
13083,bartlet,"I don't remember. I've been thinking about it for weeks, but I honestly don't remember."
13084,sam,"Excuse me, Mr. President. Good evening."
13085,bartlet,"Hey, Sam."
13086,sam,I wasn't sure whether you'd be stopping by the Talk Radio reception. I scratched out a few  remarks for you.
13087,bartlet,"Let me look at them while we walk. Toby, go with us, to this radio thing."
13088,toby,"Oh God, really sir?"
13089,bartlet,"There'll be crab puffs. New England crab puffs, by the way, made in New England."
13090,sam,"Actually, it's Alaskan crab."
13091,toby,Sam.
13092,bartlet,There's Alaskan crab in this White House?
13093,toby,He wouldn't have known the difference.
13094,bartlet,Have you tried them?
13095,sam,"I... yes, reluctantly. I think it was clear the way I ate the crab puffs that it was a gesture  of protest."
13096,bartlet,Were they good?
13097,sam,Extraordinarily good and going very fast.
13098,bartlet,Let's get there.
13099,c.j.,"How else would you spell ""Gary""?"
13100,c.j.,"Like Liza with a ""Z""."
13101,c.j.,Would you excuse me?
13102,c.j.,"Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen. Ladies and gentlemen. The President of the United States."
13103,bartlet,"Thank you. Thank you, very much. Thanks a lot. I wish I could spend more than a few minutes  with you but the polls don't close in the east for another hour and there are plenty of  election results left to falsify. "
13104,bartlet,"You know with so many people participating in the political and social debate through call  in shows, it's a good idea to be reminded..."
13105,bartlet,...it's a good idea to be reminded of the awesome impact... the awesome impact...
13106,bartlet,"I'm sorry, um... you're Dr. Jenna Jacobs, right? "
13107,bartlet,It's good to have you here.
13108,bartlet,The awesome impact of the airwaves and how that translates into the furthering of our national  discussions but obviously also how it can... how it can...
13109,bartlet,"Forgive me, Dr. Jacobs. Are you an M.D.?"
13110,bartlet,A Ph.D.?
13111,bartlet,In Psychology?
13112,bartlet,Theology?
13113,bartlet,Social work?
13114,bartlet,"I'm asking, 'cause on your show, people call in for advice and you go by the name of  Dr. Jacobs on your show. And I didn't know if maybe your listeners were confused by that,  and assumed you had advanced training in Psychology, Theology, or health care."
13115,bartlet,Good. I like your show. I like how you call homosexuality an abomination.
13116,bartlet,"Yes, it does. Leviticus."
13117,bartlet,"Chapter and verse. I wanted to ask you a couple of questions while I had you here.  I'm interested in selling my youngest daughter into slavery as sanctioned in Exodus 21:7.  (small chuckles from the guests) She's a Georgetown sophomore, speaks fluent Italian, and  always clears the table when it was her turn. What would a good price for her be? While  thinking about that, can I ask another? My Chief of Staff, LeoO McGarry, insists on working  on the Sabbath, Exodus 35:2, clearly says he should be put to death. Am I morally obligated  to kill him myself or is it okay to call the police? Here's one that's really important,  'cause we've got a lot of sports fans in this town. Touching the skin of a dead pig makes  us unclean, Leviticus 11:7. If they promise to wear gloves, can the Washington Redskins  still play football? Can Notre Dame? Can West Point? Does the whole town really have to be  together to stone my brother, John, for planting different crops side by side? Can I burn  my mother in a small family gathering for wearing garments made from two different threads? "
13118,bartlet,"Think about those questions, would you? One last thing, while you may be mistaking this  for your monthly meeting of the Ignorant Tightass Club, in this building, when the President  stands, nobody sits."
13119,bartlet,Toby.
13120,toby,"Yes, Mr. President."
13121,bartlet,That's how I beat him.
13122,sam,I'm just... I'm gonna take that crab puff. 
13123,leo,Hi.
13124,leo,"Charlie, I'm looking for the President."
13125,leo,"No, no... I... um.... I think he may have done a couple of numbers at the Talk Radio reception."
13126,leo,You're going out?
13127,leo,"Charlie, you're taking extra protection, right? "
13128,leo,"Secret Service protection, Charlie. But thanks for loading me up with that image."
13129,leo,Okay. Something about a dead pig's skin. I need to find him.
13130,sam,(into phone) Okay.
13131,josh,"Everybody should have to stay inside for three months so that they truly appreciate the  outdoors. I appreciate the outdoors, now. I'm an outdoorsman."
13133,josh,Yeah.
13135,josh,"(to C.J.) Aha! You'd thought I'd forget about it, didn't you? Banner headline, 5 days ago.  Model for the Unified Theory solved. Banner headline in the New York Times. You said it wasn't  going to be news. "
13136,c.j.,Hey! You're wearing my pajamas.
13137,josh,"Yes, I am."
13138,c.j.,"Take your coat off, let's see."
13139,c.j.,Those are too big.
13140,josh,"Yes, they are. All this time I've been working with you, did you also think I was playing  power forward for the Cleveland Cavaliers?"
13141,c.j.,I think they look good on you. (grabs Toby’s arms)
13142,toby,I think you're all freaks.
13143,toby,What do you have?
13144,sam,You're not going to believe it.
13145,c.j.,How'd they go?
13146,sam,"Twelve races, in none of them did the incumbent win. In none of them, did the party that  previously held the seat win. You know how it went? Seven to five."
13147,josh,You're kidding.
13148,c.j.,Seven republicans and five democrats?
13149,sam,Yeah.
13150,josh,The house stayed the same?
13151,josh,"After four months and 400 million dollars, everything stayed the same."
13152,sam,Yup.
13153,josh,"Tell me democracy doesn't have a sense of humor. We sit here, we drink this beer out here  on the stoop, in violation about 47 city ordinances. I don't know, Toby, it's election night.  What do you say about a government that goes out of its way to protect even citizens that try  to destroy it?"
13154,toby,God bless America.
13155,sam,(beat) God bless America.
13156,c.j.,God bless America.
13158,josh,God bless America.
13159,sam,What happened? 
13160,sam,I wanted Wengland. 
13161,sam,Did you get Stackhouse? 
13162,sam,Who'd you get? 
13163,sam,Aimsley? 
13164,sam,I don't know her. 
13165,sam,"Mark, tell me she's not one of these..."
13166,sam,I thought that was over? 
13167,sam,She's in show business. 
13168,sam,"A young, blonde, leggy Republican. "
13169,sam,I thought it turned out they didn't know anything? 
13170,sam,Yeah. 
13171,sam,George! You owe me twenty bucks on the Skins. 
13172,sam,I'm Sam Seaborn. 
13173,sam, Over under. 
13174,sam,He's good. 
13175,sam,"Because it buys things the teachers need. Like textbooks. In a fairly comprehensive study  that was done, an alarmingly high number of teachers - forty percent of teachers in  Kirkwood, Oregon, for instance, and Kirkwood, Oregon being a fair model for public school  districts across the country - forty percent of the teachers in Kirkwood, Oregon report  not having sufficient textbooks for their students.   The package offered by the Republican controlled Congress offered a grand total of zero  dollars for new textbooks. "
13176,sam,I don't...
13177,sam,"Well, if you're gonna call... "
13178,sam,There are...
13179,sam, Well that's just...
13180,sam,The difference with the old...
13181,sam,Yeah. 
13182,sam," Please, oh, please, let them not be watching. "
13183,josh, Toby. Come quick! Sam's getting his ass kicked by a girl! 
13184,toby,"Ginger, get the popcorn! "
13185,c.j.,...in a half hour with President Bartlet and President Nimbala of the Republic of  Equatorial Kuhndu who's representing the African nations. 
13186,c.j.,"The goal of the summit is to get a step closer to solving twenty-six million African AIDS  victims.  We're counting on the drug companies, we're  counting on the African nations, we're counting on the global health community and  they're counting on the White House to help broker a solution. "
13187,c.j.,"Well, it sounds like you already have, so if we need a button man, we'll call you.  Thank you, everybody, half hour in the Mural Room. "
13188,c.j., Tell them they need to be in three groups. 
13189,toby,You know what you might have mentioned? 
13190,c.j.,"It was a 14 minute briefing, I'm really gonna get reviews? "
13191,toby,"You might have mentioned that the same drug that costs ten dollars and eighty cents in  Norway, where nobody needs it, costs ninety dollars in Burundi, where everybody needs it. "
13192,c.j.,"There is nothing keeping these people here but good will, Toby! They can charge what they  want for their products. "
13193,toby,It sounds to me like we intend to be soft on the drug companies. 
13194,c.j.,"Toby, I don't think anybody expects this White House to be anything but tough on American  companies showing a profit. "
13195,toby,Damn right. 
13196,sam,Where was the 1992 World Copyright Conference? 
13197,toby,Geneva. 
13198,sam,Thank you. 
13199,c.j.," Sam! I've really gotta admire the way you came into work this  morning, head held high. "
13200,sam,And I appreciate your being the one person who's managed to abstain from heckling me. 
13201,c.j.,No problem.  There's a whole bunch of women over there. Why don't you  ask them whether Geneva's in Switzerland or Oregon? 
13202,sam, Okay! 
13203,toby, Go to my office. 
13204,sam,"Me and you, twenty questions, short answer, general knowledge test, right now! "
13205,toby,Go to my office. 
13206,sam,I'll spot you two questions. 
13207,c.j.,How much money? 
13208,toby,Go to my office. 
13209,sam,I'm going to his office. 
13210,sam,She's making the chicken sound now. 
13211,toby,Go to my office. 
13212,toby," That drug they've gotta buy from us for four dollars a unit, they can get  generic from Pakistan for forty cents. "
13213,c.j.," That's not the only bargain in Pakistan, Toby. My girlfriends and I go  for the spring fashions. "
13214,toby,It shows. 
13215,c.j.," He just made a little dig about my clothes, and  that's what's gonna be with me the rest of the day. "
13216,c.j., Hi.
13217,c.j.,Welcome. 
13218,c.j.,That's what I'm here for.
13219,c.j.,"I'm not gonna wave you off the story, but I can't tell you anything about it. "
13220,c.j.,"Grand jury investigations are secret, Bill. I can't tell you any more about it. "
13221,c.j.,Nice meeting you. 
13222,c.j.,Bill! 
13223,c.j.,Nothing. Just... nothing. 
13224,leo,It is linked to poverty. 
13225,bartlet,Would you like me to show you the list of dead millionaires? 
13226,leo,"He was saying that prostitutes, migrant laborers, the ill-educated, and victims of sexual  abuse are more likely..."
13227,bartlet,"Leo, AIDS is caused by HIV. You just named a group of people that have a higher mortality  rate across the board. Morning, Charlie. "
13228,bartlet,Where are we? 
13229,bartlet,Thank you. 
13230,leo,It was the Health Minister trying to clear up his comments. 
13231,bartlet,They have a Health Minister who doesn't think AIDS is connected to HIV! 
13232,leo,He was clearing up the comments. 
13233,leo," I didn't see it, but I have heard tell. "
13234,bartlet,He got diced and sliced by a woman named Ainsley Hayes. 
13235,leo,She's been writing some columns. 
13236,bartlet,"I know, I had Charlie pull 'em for me. Where's she been? "
13237,leo,She was clerking for Dreifort. 
13238,bartlet,We should hire her. 
13239,leo,That'd be funny! 
13240,bartlet,"No, I mean it. "
13241,leo,Mean what? 
13242,bartlet,We should hire her. 
13243,leo,"What, you mean as a joke on Sam? "
13244,bartlet,"No, not as a joke, I mean we should hire her as a reality. We should hire her. "
13245,leo,She's a Republican. 
13246,bartlet,So are half the people in this country. 
13247,leo,"Well, that half lost, so..."
13248,bartlet,"She's smart, she's not just carping. She feels a sense of something. "
13249,leo,Of what? 
13250,bartlet,Yeah.  Of duty. Of civic duty. 
13251,leo, How many pieces by her did you read? 
13252,bartlet,Three. 
13253,leo,And you're certain of her sense of civic duty? 
13254,bartlet,I can sense civic duty a mile away. 
13255,bartlet,Morning. 
13256,bartlet,Good morning. 
13257,bartlet,Morning everybody. 
13258,bartlet,"Good morning, Mr. President. "
13259,bartlet, You can tell your caption editors that Bartlet's the third guy from the  right. 
13260,c.j.,"Thank you, sir.  Presidents Bartlet and Nimbala will take just a few  questions. "
13261,bartlet,Katie.
13262,bartlet," Yes, Katie, I'm trying to shore up the sub-Saharan vote. "
13263,bartlet,It's an international health crisis; there's nothing I'm not considering. 
13264,c.j., Arthur? 
13265,bartlet," That's right. His name is Norman Borlaug, by the way, and he won the Nobel  Peace Prize in 1970. "
13266,c.j.,"Thank you, Mr. President, President Nimbala. Thank you everyone. The press start to  disperse. "
13267,bartlet, I think you're absolutely right about the kind of miracle we need. I think  we're gonna make a lot of progress in the next few days. 
13268,bartlet,"It was called dwarf wheat, which produces heavy yields without its stalk falling over  from the weight of the rain. "
13269,leo,Was it a hybrid? 
13270,bartlet,"What am I, Farmer Bob? It was wheat, and there was more than there used to be. "
13271,leo,Okay! 
13272,bartlet,And hire that girl. 
13273,leo,What girl? 
13274,bartlet,Ainsley Hayes. 
13275,leo,No. 
13276,bartlet,Why? 
13277,leo,'Cause this is one of those things you're excited about after breakfast that you forget  you told me to do by lunch. 
13278,bartlet, Not one of those. 
13279,leo,It's one of those. 
13280,bartlet,"Leo, as hard as you might try, the Republican Party isn't going anywhere. "
13281,leo,"You don't know that for sure, sir, they could all end up moving to Vancouver. "
13282,bartlet,I don't think so. 
13283,leo,"Me neither, but being in power means everybody else can take a seat for four years. "
13284,bartlet,"Charlie, I want to hire a woman whose voice I think would fit in nicely around here,  she's a conservative Republican. Do you think I should do it? "
13285,leo, See? Charlie just made a joke to you in the Oval  Office. That's how bad an idea it is. 
13286,bartlet,Leo. 
13287,leo,"Seriously, Mr. President, if you want to do this, it's not an uninteresting notion,  let's just do it in a more high-profile place. Put a Republican in the cabinet. "
13288,bartlet,"We might do that, Leo. A hundred million Republicans; we might hire as many as two of  them. But for now, hire this girl. "
13289,leo,To do what? 
13290,bartlet, I don't know. She's a lawyer. Put her in the counsel's office. 
13291,leo,You really want me to do this? 
13292,bartlet,Yes. 
13293,leo,What if she doesn't want to work here? 
13294,bartlet,"Appeal to her sense of duty. And smooth it over with the staff. Really, I don't want to  hear from them. "
13295,leo,"She can always have my job, you know. "
13296,bartlet,"Yes, she can. "
13297,leo,"Thank you, Mr. President. "
13298,bartlet,Thank you. 
13299,bartlet,Charlie. 
13300,bartlet,"When they close the book on me and you, it will say that at this moment you were not  there for me, and for that, obviously, there'll be some kind of punishment. "
13302,sam, Excuse me? 
13304,sam,Did you say something to me? 
13306,sam,Really. 
13308,sam,'Cause it sounded like maybe you might have made a wisecrack about Oregon... California. 
13310,sam, This is late for you. 
13311,c.j.,I got lost. 
13312,sam,Where? 
13313,c.j.,On the way to work. 
13314,sam,When? 
13315,c.j.,"Now, this morning. "
13316,sam,You got lost on your way to work? 
13317,c.j.,"Good morning, Carol. "
13318,sam,"Morning, Carol. "
13319,c.j.,We'll do messages in a minute. 
13320,sam,You got lost on your way to work. 
13321,c.j., Don't make fun of me. 
13322,sam,I wouldn't worry about that. 
13323,c.j., I didn't sleep much last night. 
13324,sam,How much did you sleep? 
13325,c.j.,"None, not at all. "
13326,sam,"You slept none, not at all. "
13327,c.j.,Sam! 
13328,sam,"I am, today, particularly excited about you being the spokesperson for the President. "
13329,c.j., Let me ask you something. 
13330,c.j.,Yeah. 
13331,sam,"You know you haven't asked me anything yet, right? "
13332,c.j.,"Yeah.  Yeah. Listen, never mind. "
13333,c.j.,"Seriously, forget about it. "
13334,sam,What was your question? 
13335,leo," The two of you, come take a walk with me. "
13336,sam,What's going on? 
13337,leo, I wanted to tell you this out where there were people so you  wouldn't scream about it. 
13338,c.j.,Scream about what? 
13339,leo,The woman who was on Capital Beat with Sam Sunday night. 
13340,sam,What about her? 
13341,leo,I'm offering her a job. 
13342,sam, Where? 
13343,leo,Here. 
13344,c.j.,Are you kidding? 
13345,leo,No. 
13346,c.j.,Are you kidding? 
13347,leo, No. 
13348,c.j., Are you kidding? 
13349,leo,No. 
13350,c.j.," Well, what the hell made you think I wouldn't scream where there are people?!"
13351,leo,I took a shot. 
13352,leo, Come this way. 
13354,josh,There are a lot of people in Africa with HIV. 
13356,josh,American companies hold the patents on the medicines they need. 
13358,josh,"Most people in most African countries can't afford to buy the drugs at these prices, so  they buy them on the black market. "
13360,josh,Yes. 
13362,josh,They cost about a hundred and fifty bucks a week. 
13364,josh,A police officer in Kenya makes forty-three dollars a month. 
13366,toby, Let's make it the issue. 
13367,toby,"Let's make it the issue for the moment, please."
13368,toby,I think President Nimbala's saying that there's more money in giving a white guy an  erection than curing a black guy of AIDS. 
13369,toby,"They're not dying from eye infections, Alan. "
13370,toby,"Alan, if it was 26 million Europeans dying, we'd have had a solution yesterday. "
13371,josh,"How much would it cost for you to provide free drugs to the Sahelise Republic, Kenya, and  the Republic of Equatorial Kuhndu?"
13372,josh,"Why not? We're talking about a hundred and thirty thousand patients, two hundred  milligram pills, three times a day every day. What's the X-factor? "
13373,toby, We're nowhere. Let's take a break. 
13374,leo,Yeah. 
13375,leo,Good.
13376,leo,Yeah. 
13377,leo,Why? 
13378,leo,"What would that be, exactly? "
13379,leo,Thank you. 
13380,leo,Ainsley. 
13381,leo,Leo's fine. 
13382,leo, Were you offered coffee or something to drink? 
13383,leo,Okay. 
13384,leo,"Excellent, and..."
13385,leo,"She'll be happy to hear that, she's standing right outside the door. "
13386,leo," So, I have to tell you, I've never seen Sam Seaborn get beat the  way you beat him on Monday. "
13387,leo,Leo. 
13388,leo,"I... didn't really follow that, but whatever. "
13389,leo, It's wrong? 
13390,leo,"That's fine, except you weren't summoned here to be reprimanded. "
13391,leo,"You have an interesting conversational style, do you know that? "
13392,leo,I used to have a nervous condition. 
13393,leo,I drank a lot of scotch. 
13394,leo,I get drunk when I drink too much. 
13395,leo,Leo. 
13396,leo,So I could offer you a job. 
13397,leo,Cat and mouse? 
13398,leo,Here it comes. 
13399,leo,"Yes. Associate White House counsel. You'd report to the Deputy White House Counsel, who  reports to the White House Counsel, who reports to me. "
13400,leo,You want a glass of scotch? 
13401,c.j.,Yeah? 
13402,sam,"C.J., see a sleep doctor. Take a pill. Do something. "
13403,c.j.,"I rode the Lifecycle this morning for an hour and a half. If it was a real cycle, I'd be  in Belgium by now. "
13404,sam," C.J., what did you want to ask me the other day? "
13405,c.j.,"Sam, if I talked to you about it, you could be subpoenaed. "
13406,sam,Don't worry about it. 
13407,c.j.,It could cost you...
13408,sam, Don't worry about it. 
13409,c.j., There's no problem. I just need  some sleep. What can I bring into the room about the conference? 
13410,sam,The sessions are productive. Progress is being made. These kinds of things take time.  All the parties are optimistic. 
13411,c.j.,Are any of the parties optimistic? 
13412,sam,No. 
13413,c.j., Okay. 
13414,c.j.,Yeah.  
13415,sam,Did you say something to me? 
13416,sam,'Cause I thought you might have said something. 
13417,leo,Yes. 
13418,leo," Yeah, Ainsley, even if you hadn't already told me all of this, you know,  many, many times, I would know it anyway, 'cause I have this FBI file. "
13419,leo,Yes. 
13420,leo,Yes. 
13421,leo,Ainsley...
13422,leo,Where are you going?
13423,leo,"Well, you go, girl. "
13424,leo,I don't think that's true. 
13425,leo," C.J. Cregg thinks you kill your pets. You don't do that,  do you? "
13426,leo,Ainsley. 
13427,leo,Don't you want to work in the White House? 
13428,leo, Okay. 
13429,leo,Ainsley...
13430,leo,The President likes smart people who disagree with him. He wants to hear from you.  The President's asking you to serve. And everything else is crap. 
13431,leo,Think about it overnight. Come back here at six tomorrow and give me your answer.   Margaret! 
13432,leo,"How you doin'?  Show Ms. Hayes out, would you, please? "
13433,josh,"You're listening to me, but you're not understanding me. "
13434,toby,"No, I'm disagreeing with you. That doesn't mean I'm not listening to you, or  understanding what you're saying. I'm doing all three at the same time. "
13435,josh,"You gotta get out of their face, Toby, they can get up any time they want. We don't have  anything they need. "
13436,toby,They need patent treaties to be enforced. 
13437,josh,And they are gonna be enforced. The pharmaceutical companies got half the House of  Representatives elected. Congress is gonna get serious about this. 
13438,toby,The pills cost 'em four cents a unit to make. 
13439,josh,You know that's not true. The second pill cost 'em four cents; the first pill cost 'em  four hundred million dollars. 
13440,toby,"They also enjoy unprecedented tax breaks, foreign tax credits, research and  experimentation exemptions, and expensing of research expenditures. To say nothing  of the fact that business is pretty good, so they're gonna cover their butt. "
13441,josh,Tell me about Nimbala. 
13442,toby,They didn't have cheese. 
13443,toby,It's boysenberry. 
13444,toby, It's new. 
13445,josh,Tell me about Nimbala. 
13446,toby,"He's a good President, Josh. He was a great soldier, a brilliant commander, he led his  people for 28 years, he can't get ahead of the curve. He's cursed by geography. You know  what, if the ground won't grow anything, you don't have an economy. Still, he stands in  a room and he talks about Norman Borlaug. He came here himself, Josh, he didn't send  delegates. I think it's 'cause he doesn't have any. I think he's holding his country  together with both hands. "
13447,josh,"Then let's make sure we send him back with something, is my point."
13448,toby,Yeah.
13449,toby, Yeah. 
13450,c.j.,Good afternoon. Guess what? The aduit figures released yesterday by the Senate Finance  comfirmed earlier reports released by the Congressional Budget Office regarding the  increased budget projections. 
13451,c.j.,This exceeds even the most optimistic estimates published last year by the White House  budget office of 300 billion and the CBO's projection last quarter of 900 billion. 
13452,josh,What's that? 
13453,josh,Why? 
13454,josh,What's the problem? 
13455,toby,They don't own wristwatches. They can't tell time. 
13456,toby,"Mr. President, may we speak with you alone, please? "
13457,c.j.,It's good to meet you. 
13458,c.j.,Well...  okay. 
13459,c.j.,How'd you know? 
13460,c.j.,"Well, someone's gonna tell him eventually. "
13461,c.j.,One of the witnesses who was called. What could happen? 
13462,c.j.,Yeah. 
13463,toby,President Nimbala? 
13464,toby,"I'm gonna put a deal together, and I want you to agree to it. "
13465,toby,"I can get them to lower their prices - but you have to commit your military, your customs  bureau, and your Ministry of Health. You have to commit them to stopping the influx of  black market HIV drugs from Korea and Pakistan, and from wherever else they're coming. "
13466,josh,Mr. President. The U.S. Department of Commerce will put your country on a watch list.  That's the first step towards trade sanctions. Our Congress could end all aid to your  country. 
13467,toby,"Or you can agree to what we're saying. In exchange for which we believe we can get  Congress to forgive the debt, and all your past development loans, and we believe the  Export-Import Bank will offer a billion dollars in loans to finance the purchase of  American AIDS medication. "
13468,josh,"Congress won't have to, sir. The Treasury and the State Department will review it, but  if we spread the loans out over several countries in your region on a case-by-case basis,  and if none of the loans exceed a hundred million dollars, we don't need Congressional  approval. That law might change soon. "
13469,toby,"Yes he would, Mr. President. I swear to God, he would. "
13470,toby, Go tell Leo. 
13471,sam,Hi. 
13472,sam," You know, something you forgot to mention about the 95 percent of the money  going straight into the classroom and past the pork-barrel buffet is that the school only  got the money if they agreed not to distribute condoms. "
13473,josh," Hey, Sam. "
13474,sam,Hey. 
13475,josh, Where's Leo? 
13476,josh,You look familiar to me.  You're Ainsley Hayes! 
13477,sam,She works here now. 
13478,josh,What? 
13479,sam,Leo hired her. 
13480,josh,What're you talking about? 
13481,sam,"Leo hired her. He told me and C.J., he was waiting to tell you and Toby. "
13482,josh,What was he waiting for? 
13483,sam," How the hell do I know, Josh? "
13484,josh,You're not taking the job? 
13485,josh,"Hey, I'm still back on he offered you the job... but you're not taking the job? "
13486,sam,"No, man, why participate in the process when you can get a job commenting on it? "
13487,sam, This is the wrong place to talk about guns right now. I thought  your column was idiotic. 
13488,sam," It's not about personal freedom, and it certainly has  nothing to do with public safety. It's just that some people like guns. "
13489,toby, Where's Leo? 
13490,sam, What? 
13491,toby,Where's Leo? 
13492,josh,We don't know. 
13493,josh,"Charlie, you seen Leo? "
13494,bartlet,600? 
13495,bartlet,Television and radio? 
13496,bartlet,"When do I see pictures, and who's gonna tell me what I'm looking for? "
13497,bartlet, I want Fitzwallace and Nancy. 
13498,toby," Donna, tell C.J. it's an open lid? "
13500,bartlet, Leo. 
13501,leo," Excuse me, everybody, could we have the  room a moment please? "
13502,leo,Sam. 
13503,bartlet,"Mr. President, three hours ago there was a coup in your country. The AFRC has taken the  capital. "
13504,bartlet,"We're finding out. The information's coming very quickly now from our people in Angola  and Sudan. Mr. President, I think you should sit. "
13505,bartlet,"No, no, sir! My State Department is offering you asylum in the U.S. "
13506,bartlet,You can't go home. You can't go home! 
13507,bartlet,"They have the capital, they have the radio station, they have the television station. "
13508,bartlet,I'm evacuating the embassy. 
13509,bartlet,Yes. 
13510,bartlet,"I don't need to trade you! If they won't give me the Americans, we'll go and get 'em  ourselves, and they know that, and they'll let 'em go. "
13511,toby,"Your embassy is in exile, Mr. President. "
13512,bartlet,They will shoot you the moment you step off the plane.
13513,bartlet,"We think your brother and your two sons are already dead. We think your wife is being  hidden in Kenya. You understand, don't you, why I can't offer military assistance? "
13514,bartlet,"Sit down, sir. "
13515,toby,It happened. 
13516,bartlet,They executed him in the airport parking lot. 
13517,bartlet,Okay. I'll see you Monday. He gets up and leaves the office. 
13519,josh,No.
13521,josh,‘Cause you weren’t shouting.
13523,josh,That’s right.
13525,josh,They’re still saying that I owe them fifty thousand dollars and that   “failure to pay will result in a negative report on your credit.”
13527,josh,On my credit.  Sam!
13529,josh,I got another letter.
13530,sam,Don’t worry about it.
13531,josh,I am worried about it.
13532,sam,I called an insurance guy.
13533,josh,They’re referring me to insurance code 4336. You know what that means?
13534,sam,No.
13535,josh,"Okay. Uh, there’s fifty thousand dollars worth of hospital bills they’re saying they don’t cover.  You know what that means?"
13536,sam,You may have to get yourself a job mowing lawns after school.
13537,josh,Sam.
13538,sam,Don’t worry about it.
13539,josh, Sam!
13542,sam,Hi.
13544,sam,What’s it about?
13546,sam,No.
13548,sam,I’m the Deputy Communications Director. I don’t do the radio address.
13550,sam,Wouldn’t be surprised.
13552,sam,The President?
13554,sam,Why wouldn’t he take it seriously?
13556,sam,I’m not the one who has to read it.
13558,sam,It’s not live. He can do another take.
13560,sam,Yeah.
13562,sam,I remember.
13564,sam,What did he say? Insurance code 9336?
13566,sam,What people?
13568,sam,Knock ‘em dead.
13570,sam,Why?
13572,sam,I’ve seen it.
13574,sam,I’m sure it’s great.
13576,sam,Sure.
13583,bartlet,How’s it going?
13585,bartlet,"That’s almost hard to believe, Donna.  How is everybody?"
13587,bartlet,Not quite.
13589,bartlet,The speech.
13591,bartlet,"Thank you. Let’s do this in one, shall we?"
13593,bartlet,One-take Bartlet. That’s what old Jack Warner used to call me.
13594,bartlet,"Good morning. This month, as autumn is in full bloom in much of the nation, the weekends will  be devoted by many of you to leaf peeping and football... watch... ing... "
13595,bartlet, I’m sorry. Leaf peeping? Is that something we do now?
13597,bartlet,I heard that.
13598,bartlet,"Sorry, everybody. This is gonna be it. Four is my lucky number."
13600,bartlet,"Five is my lucky number. ""Fifth-take Bartlet"" -- that's what Jack Warner used to call me."
13602,bartlet,"Yeah, because I used to be a contract player in Hollywood and I'm 97 years old."
13604,bartlet,Here we go.
13605,c.j.,"How you doing, Toby?"
13606,toby,I'm fine. Thanks. Listen...
13607,c.j.,Have you noticed that I'm one of the few people around here whose nose isn't bent out of  shape over Ainsley Hayes?
13608,toby,Yeah. Listen...
13609,c.j.,I'm serious!
13610,toby,"You heard the news and you slammed the door so hard it broke, okay? You heard the news and  you broke the White House."
13611,c.j.,"Yeah, but I'm over it now and I'm saying other people aren't and they should get over it."
13612,toby,I'll see what I can do. In the mean time...
13613,c.j.,"I'm going to tell you something, Toby: I don't think it's that she's a Republican, I think it's  that she's a Republican woman and she’s good-looking."
13614,toby,"Well, those are three things, when in combination, usually spell 'careerism,' but..."
13615,c.j.,"Well, I think it's sexist in a bad way, and I'm coming down on her side."
13616,toby,Good for you. Look...
13617,c.j.,"Toby, I am serious about this!"
13618,toby,Ed Barrie is doing the Meet the Press on Sunday. Did you know that?
13619,c.j.,No. This Sunday?
13620,toby,Day after tomorrow.
13621,c.j.,"He's retiring, maybe it's just a farewell retrospective kind of a..."
13622,toby,He's also doing Sam and Cokie Late Edition and Capitol Beat.
13623,c.j.,Are you sure about this?
13624,toby,Sam got it from Mark Gottfried.
13625,c.j.,Has anyone talked to Judy?
13626,toby,The DOD press office isn't confirming anything.
13627,c.j.,They won't confirm whether a three-star general is going on television to beat up the President?
13628,toby,No.
13629,c.j.,Carol!
13630,toby,"By the way, you are a beautiful woman. And no one around here has ever assumed you were either  ambitious or stupid."
13631,c.j.,Toby.
13632,toby,Yeah.
13633,c.j.,Took two years.
13634,c.j.,I need to see General Barrie. I want you to go to the Pentagon and get him and I don't want  him anywhere near a press line when he comes into the West Wing.
13635,c.j.,I could give a damn if it's convenient or not.
13636,c.j.,"And I work for his boss, so get him here."
13637,toby,Want some help?
13638,c.j.,No.
13639,toby,Have a nice day. 
13640,c.j.,"Hey, has Leo told Tribbey about his new Associate Counsel yet?"
13641,toby,"I'll check the wire to see if any maimings have been reported, but I don't think he's told him yet."
13642,c.j.,Should be some decent dinner theater.
13643,toby,Let me know if you need me on Captain Queeg.
13644,leo,He thinks it's a great idea. He can't wait to meet you.
13645,leo,Yeah.
13646,leo,Why are you surprised?
13647,leo," Lionel Tribbey is the White House Counsel. He's a brilliant and  fair-minded attorney, and he will accept you on his staff because he is... well, fair-minded  and because..."
13648,leo," I have, in fact, not told him yet, no."
13649,leo,"I'm a politician, Ainsley. Of course I lied to you just then."
13650,leo,It's about to get better.
13651,leo,Yeah?
13652,leo,"This is the White House, you get used to that feeling."
13653,leo,Ainsley...
13654,leo,You're going to meet him right now. It's going to be fine...
13655,leo,"Well, that's TV. He's making a full-throated defense of the President! That's what we do.  Believe me, in real life, when the cameras are off..."
13656,leo,Lionel...
13657,leo,"Look, if I may..."
13658,leo, What'd we do?
13659,leo,Do we?
13660,leo,I'm sure there's some...
13661,leo,"This is Ainsley Hayes. She's scared of meeting you, so be nice."
13662,leo,Yeah.
13663,leo,"She's not an idiot, Lionel. She clerked for Dreifort."
13664,leo,"Dreifort's a Supreme Court Justice, Lionel, so let's speak of him with respect and practice some  tolerance for those who disagree with us."
13665,leo,"She's working for you, Lionel!"
13666,leo,She's working for you. The President asked me to hire her for your office.
13667,leo,The United States.
13668,leo,I thought it went pretty well.
13669,bartlet,"'Our farming families stand for the values that keep our nation strong: faith, calm perseverance,  and patience...'"
13671,bartlet,I had it!
13672,bartlet,"It's a bit of a bad time, Lionel..."
13673,bartlet,"And we will, Lionel, but right now I don't know if you noticed but there are thirty or forty  other people in the room, many of whom have donated significant amounts of money to the Democratic  Party, so perhaps you could put a tighter grip on your horses and we will talk about it later."
13674,bartlet,"Well, obviously, Lionel Tribbey is a brilliant lawyer whom we cannot live without, or there  would be very little reason not to put him in prison. Let's try again."
13675,toby,You've got two paragraphs on H-404 for the AFL-CIO. I want you to rethink them.
13676,sam,Rethink them how?
13677,toby,Cut them.
13678,sam,Why can't he talk about Superfund?
13679,toby,'Cause it's the AFL-CIO and they want to hear about how we're going to protect their jobs.
13680,sam,How about we start by protecting the planet they live on?
13681,toby,How about you start by cutting the paragraphs?
13682,sam,Fine.
13683,toby,What are you doing?
13684,sam,"Trying to help Josh with his insurance thing. The hospital was “out of network.” Therefore,  they're claiming responsibility for only 20% of a life-saving medical procedure. Also, he didn't  get the procedure--  cleared beforehand."
13685,toby,"His lung was collapsed, and blood stopped flowing to his brain, and he was supposed to dial up  the automated 24-hour customer care service line?"
13686,sam,"If it keeps up like this, he is going to have to sue these people."
13687,toby,"I like a country where you can sue the insurance company but not the people who shot you.   Anyway, cut the two paragraphs."
13688,toby,What?
13689,sam,He can sue the people that shot him.
13690,toby,The people that shot him are dead.
13691,sam,No. Hardly any of them are.
13693,josh,When did he finally nail it?
13695,josh, He hasn’t done it yet?
13697,josh, What about the audience?
13699,josh,What the hell are we talking about?
13702,josh,Leaf peeping?
13704,josh,"Insurance Victory!  “And the weak shall be made strong”, Donna, not “Might is right,”  but rather “Might for right”."
13706,josh,It doesn’t. Don’t eat my French fries.
13707,josh,Hey.
13708,sam,Hey. Good. Come on in.
13709,josh,Did you beat them into submission?
13710,sam,No.
13711,josh,Did you beat them at all?
13712,sam,Forget about the insurance.
13713,josh,Unless the insurance company forgets about the insurance--
13714,sam,"The Southern Poverty Law Center.  Josh, I think you know that for the last three months  you were out recovering, a lot of people were looking for a new legislative avenue for federal  law enforcement to get the extremist."
13715,josh,You could throw out the Bill of Rights.
13716,sam,Toby tried.
13717,josh, I was kidding.
13718,sam,"Josh, this is our way in-- a civil action. You could subpoena everything. Membership rolls,  donor rolls, minutes of meetings, weapons inventory, computer downloads. You depose every man  and woman that’s ever been to a meeting and every man and woman they name.   Josh, the Southern Poverty Law Center wants you to sue the Knights of the Klu Klux Clan for  100 million dollars."
13719,josh, Yeah...
13720,josh,Yeah. 
13735,bartlet,Really?
13737,bartlet,"Good afternoon, Mrs. Landingham."
13738,bartlet, Go away right now. 
13739,bartlet,"Not for long, Mrs. Landingham."
13741,bartlet,Absolutely!
13743,bartlet,Who cares? It’s been 14 weeks! Do these curtains close?
13745,bartlet,Yes. You’re right... where?
13747,bartlet,New Hampshire is an hour and a half away by plane. I don’t think I have that kind of time.
13749,bartlet, Yes! We have a bedroom right here in the building. That was so smart!
13751,bartlet,Let’s go!
13753,bartlet,What?
13755,bartlet,Oh God... I hate plutonium!
13757,bartlet,What happens at six?
13759,bartlet,Where the hell is Cochran’s Mills?
13761,bartlet,Right.
13763,bartlet," I don’t think it’s gonna take more than a couple of minutes, but I like your  confidence."
13765,bartlet,Can’t we just close the curtains?
13767,c.j.,Is he here?
13768,c.j.,Carol.
13769,c.j.,Ms. Cregg!
13770,c.j.,"Yes I do, so what are you doing here?"
13771,c.j.,I heard you the first time. Where’s the General?
13772,c.j.,"Well, I’m sending you back."
13773,c.j.,Is Ed Barrie doing the morning shows?
13774,c.j.,I would know and I do know. And so do you so cut the crap.
13775,c.j.,He’s gonna go on television and trash the President-that’s gonna be the last thing he does before  he retires?
13776,c.j.,Lieutenant! He’s gonna trash the President?
13777,c.j.,"My President is your President, too."
13778,c.j.," Well, that shouldn’t get too many people alarmed for no reason."
13779,c.j., It’s called “Ring and Run”.
13780,c.j.,"Go back to the Pentagon right now. Tell General Barrie, C.J. Cregg says he’s a coward."
13781,leo,I’ll be honest with you. I didn’t even know we had offices down here.
13782,leo,I wonder what else we got down here.
13783,leo,Room 442 is what we’re looking for. I wouldn’t be surprised if we see it any second now.
13784,leo,There’s no way you’d find it yourself.
13785,leo,Don’t worry about it. Room 442... where the hell is it?
13786,leo,"Kid, the others are gonna come around."
13787,leo,"See, you got to remember that the people you’re talking about live their lives under siege  24 hours every day at a time in their lives where they’re trying with all their might to do  good. You’re in their foxhole."
13788,leo,I know.  It’s right over here... 442. 
13789,leo,It’s written down here. This is the Steam Pipe Trunk Distribution Venue.
13790,leo,"No, you’re working in your office."
13791,leo,"Ainsley, don’t worry about Sam or Josh and Toby or C.J. or the Democrats on the hill or  Republicans on television. You’re here to serve the President. Anyway... welcome to the  White House."
13792,josh,And how are they tying the two shooters and the signal guy to the Klan?
13793,sam,"They're tying them to the Klan, West Virginia White Pride, the Brotherhood of Aryan Nations."
13794,josh,How does that...?
13795,sam,"The following is in the possession of the F.B.I. A map and the President's itinerary, given to  the shooters by the chapter head of White Pride. A videotape of a meeting the shooters attended  with the leader railing against interracial couples, specifically citing Charlie and Zoey, using  the term ""lone wolf"" over and over, which is the phrase they use when they want their younger  members to take matters into their own hands. A copy of Hunter, by William Pierce, bought at a  Klan rally in Blacksburg. In the book, Pierce encourages fellow supremacists to rid the earth of  interracial couples by shooting them. This is enough -- more than enough -- to begin deposing  witnesses."
13796,sam, You wanted to see me?
13797,leo,"Uh, yeah. I just wanted to tell you that Joyce and Brookline are at it again."
13798,sam,What'd they do?
13799,leo,They told Government Affairs that we never had the Rockland memo.
13800,josh,I think we did have the Rockland memo.
13801,leo,We did. Would you talk to the two of them?
13802,sam,Yeah... I think I also better talk to someone on Government Affairs.
13803,leo,Tribbey already sent Ainsley Hayes.
13804,sam,To do what?
13805,leo,Talk to the Associate Majority...
13806,sam,That's something I couldn't do?
13807,leo,He wanted to send a lawyer.
13808,sam,I'm a lawyer. Everybody in the room's a lawyer.
13809,leo,From the Counsel's Office.
13810,sam,Good. And I'll tell everybody else to keep their fingers crossed a story hasn't been leaked we  withheld evidence then tried to cover our tracks.
13811,toby,"Sam, that's enough."
13812,sam, Anything else?
13813,leo,No.
13814,sam,Thank you. 
13815,toby,"His point isn't wholly without merit, Leo."
13816,leo, What do you need?
13817,josh,Sam was talking to me. The Southern Poverty Law Center...
13818,toby,We know.
13819,josh,What do you think?
13820,toby,"Well, I'm not wild about it."
13821,josh,Why?
13822,toby,"Our people can be deposed too, which leaves them vulnerable to embarrassing questions like,  ""Have you ever tried cocaine?"" They can ask Sam has he ever slept with a prostitute?"
13823,josh,Those questions are irrelevant.
13824,leo,"That's why they'll ask them. If one of our people refuses to answer, it's a story."
13825,toby,So we're not wild about it.
13826,leo,"That said, say the word, and we'll take a leave of absence and join your legal team."
13827,toby,"""He is an Englishman"" is from Pinafore. Tribbey says it's from Penzance, by the way."
13828,leo,It's from Pinafore.
13829,toby,He says it's the one about duty.
13830,leo,They're all about duty.
13831,toby,I want to be very clear: I could give a damn.
13832,leo,Yeah.
13834,bartlet,Is this still my first term?
13836,bartlet,Here we go. 
13837,bartlet,Good evening.
13838,bartlet,"It's evening. It's dark outside, Charlie."
13839,bartlet,What time is it?
13841,bartlet,Excuse me... No. I can't. I've got to go.
13843,bartlet,"Kids, I am so sorry. I have to go now, to a special meeting... of the government. I will mail  you all an autographed copy of the picture we took together. And one day, you will all understand."
13844,bartlet,"Take a break, Charlie."
13845,bartlet,I'm going to a special meeting...
13846,bartlet,Sure. Would you like to get that smile off your face before I send you on special assignment  to the Yukon?
13847,c.j.,Sir...
13848,c.j.,Sir...
13849,c.j.,"Sir, due respect, that wasn't what I was referring to. I think jumping up and down on the  Commander in Chief and then beating a path out of town is an act of cowardice."
13850,c.j.,"And I would too, sir, except -- and again, I say this with all due respect..."
13851,c.j.,"I say this with all due respect: I think your motives are personal, and I'd like to discuss  that, sir."
13852,c.j.,"No, sir, I think that's about the cold war ending ten years ago and America not needing to spend  quite so much money defending itself against a country that can't bake bread."
13853,c.j.,"Yes, sir. Pers-Tempo is up because higher paying civilian jobs are luring men and women trained  in high tech. We're more than happy to take the rap for a booming economy, sir."
13854,c.j.,"No sir. Again, with all respect, I hate to disagree, but it means unfit for service based on the  Pentagon's ""two war"" doctrine. It's based on how fast these divisions would be able to extract  themselves from their peacekeeping mission, retrain on home bases, and ship off to a second of  two, full-scale Gulf-War-sized conflicts. There are also some both inside and outside the  Pentagon who question whether the C4 ratings might not be a political maneuver on the part of  the DOD to help Republican allies in Congress secure more defense money. "
13855,c.j.,"No, I don't think you will, General. "
13856,c.j.,"I said, ""I don't think you will."" "
13857,c.j.,"Is there anything else, sir?"
13858,bartlet,"Guys, it's very important that nobody tries to kill me in the next hour or so."
13860,bartlet,I was on a conference call with Cardinal Law and the Archbishop of Chicago.
13862,bartlet,"Yeah. ""Excuse me, Your Eminence, but the First Lady is a little randy, and she says I'm good  to go""."
13864,bartlet," Good, take your clothes off."
13866,bartlet,Get 'em off.
13868,bartlet,"Abbey, you have two minutes, or I swear to God I'm gonna get Mrs. Landingham drunk."
13870,bartlet,What was that thing you were doin'?
13871,bartlet,"Tonight, in Pennsylvania."
13872,bartlet,"It was a monument dedication, a statue?"
13873,bartlet,Statue to who?
13874,bartlet,"You went all the way to Cochran's... whatever to dedicate a monument to Nellie Bly? Abbey, you  can really pass that kind of thing along."
13875,bartlet,"You haven't changed into the ""special garment""."
13877,bartlet,"Yeah. You know what I did, just then, that was stupid?  I minimized the importance of the  statue that was dedicated to Nellie Bly, an extraordinary woman to whom we all owe a great deal."
13879,bartlet,This isn't happening to me.
13881,bartlet,Then she's the one I want to beat the crap out of.
13883,bartlet,"Yes, Abigail--"
13885,bartlet,"She sounds like an incredible woman, Abbey. I'm particularly impressed that she beat a fictional  record. If she goes twenty-one thousand leagues under the sea I'll name a damn school after her.  Let's have sex."
13887,bartlet,I couldn't possibly hear about the rest of the iceberg right now.
13889,bartlet,Keep talking. I'm just gonna sit here and think about plutonium and the things I can do with it.
13890,sam,Brown v. Invisible Empire Knights of the Ku Klux Klan. The court found for the Southern Christian  Leadership Conference and the marchers attacked in Decatur.
13891,josh,Sam...
13892,sam,"Vietnamese Fisherman's Association v. the Knights of the KKK. A civil action enjoining the Klan  from operating the Texas Paramilitary Army, they shut 'em down."
13893,josh,Yeah...
13894,sam,"Donald v. United Klans of America. They sued on behalf of a black youth who was lynched. The jury  returned a seven million dollar verdict and deeded the headquarters to the mother. The court took  the bat cave, Josh."
13895,josh,"Sam, here's the thing. It's not just--"
13896,sam,Hang on a second.
13897,josh,I'm... kinda caught--
13898,sam,Hang on a second. 
13899,sam,Hey!
13900,sam,Hey.
13901,sam,Did you talk to Steve Joyce and Mark Brookline?
13902,sam,"See, I was told you were just going to be working in the Majority Counsel's office, which I wasn't  wild about to begin with, but it's my understanding I'd be talking to Brookline and Joyce seeing  as how they work for me."
13903,sam,"Well, wasn't that spunky of you."
13904,sam," I'll be back in just a second, okay?"
13905,sam,Ainsley?
13906,sam,Look... can I talk to you for a minute? All I was really trying to say...
13907,sam,Who did this? Who did this?
13908,sam,Yes you do.
13909,sam,Who sent you this?
13910,sam,Ainsley?
13911,sam,How did your meeting end up going with Brookline and Joyce?
13912,sam," You know what, guys? When I write something, I sign my name."
13913,sam,"Here, I'll show you."
13914,sam,Do you have any idea how big a harassment suit you just exposed us to?
13915,sam,You're fired. S. Seaborn.
13916,sam,Lionel?
13917,sam,I'm--nothing. I'm not-nothing. Except it's from Pinafore.
13918,sam,"I hate to stick my head in the lion's mouth, but I got to ask you: were you the Recording  Secretary of the Princeton Gilbert and Sullivan Society for two years?"
13919,sam,I'm just saying...
13920,bartlet,"Do it live, that's what I always say."
13922,bartlet,"By the way, sweet knees, the Statue of Liberty."
13924,bartlet,Right there at the front door to the country!
13926,bartlet,Like a lawn jockey.
13927,c.j., Mr. President?
13929,bartlet,"No, it's okay.  I'll be right behind you."
13931,bartlet,Go.
13932,c.j.,Mr. President...
13933,bartlet,Is this about Ed Barrie?
13934,c.j.,"Yes, it is. I wanted to ask if..."
13935,bartlet,"Go ahead and let him out of the box. Say what you want about Barrie, and I could say plenty,  but the man was the first one in and the last one out of a war that I didn't want anything to  do with. Man's earned the right to say whatever he wants. Let him out of the box, would you?"
13936,c.j.,"Yes, sir."
13937,bartlet,Anything else?
13938,c.j.,"No, sir."
13939,bartlet,I'm outta here.
13940,josh,"It ties up the staff indefinitely when there are... I mean, there are other things that they  should be doing. I appear to be using a high-profile position for my personal agenda--"
13941,sam,I don't...
13942,josh,"--but mostly I just, I just think a lawsuit is... too small. I can't have it be like I...  slipped in their driveway. It's different than that to me. I don't want to sue 'em."
13943,sam,Okay. What about the insurance company?
13944,josh,Them I'll sue no problem.
13945,josh,Yeah? We're on our way.  She's here. Let’s go.
13946,c.j.,"No, I want to make it very clear that Mr. Konanov, while he's here in Washington is not  meeting with the Secretary of State or any Cabinet level official for that matter.  He's not meeting with the UN ambassador or any senior aides representing NATO allies.  And he's certainly not meeting with the President. He will be coming to the White House  to meet with some of the President's advisors on the Balkans. Who's next?"
13947,c.j.,Yeah.
13948,c.j.,"We'll have a fully ratified, comprehensive Test Ban Treaty."
13949,c.j.,"I think like all freshmen, Senator elect Mitchell will discover that he is one of  a hundred and that his power is considerably less than he would like it to be.  That having been said, the new Senate will ratify the Treaty and we really don't  care what condition his body is in when we do."
13950,c.j.,Danny.
13951,c.j.,"Okay, anyone but Danny?"
13952,c.j.,No.
13953,c.j.,"Danny, I don't know every thought that passes through the President's head, but there  have been no discussions."
13954,c.j.,That I'm aware of.
13955,c.j.,You bet. Who's next?
13956,josh, She walked into it. She knows it too.
13958,josh,"She can't confirm that the President hasn't considered it less she asks the President  if he's considered it, at which point, he'll have considered it."
13960,josh,It was a better organized thought in my head. Is she done?
13962,josh,Let's go.
13964,josh,No.
13966,josh,Why should he?
13968,josh,He doesn't.
13970,josh,Mitchell's not a factor.
13972,josh,No.
13973,josh,How do you change subjects so fast?
13975,josh,"No, I mean it. How do you go from a Test Ban Treaty and a Lame Duck Congress to OSHA?"
13977,josh,It shouldn't surprise you to learn that I do not.
13979,josh,"Donna, in the scheme of things, who really cares?"
13981,josh,"Yes, yes, yes, yes."
13983,josh,"People who lose the ability to pinch, I got to tell you, I don't know from where  they summon the will to go on."
13985,josh,Aren't you one of 'you guys'?
13987,c.j.,I know!
13988,josh,You walked right into it.
13989,c.j.,"There was no other direction to walk. Now, please, just answer know to this question:  Has the President considered it?"
13990,josh,No.
13991,c.j.,Good.
13992,josh,"Listen, not that I know of."
13993,c.j.,Josh!
13994,sam,Listen.
13995,josh,What?
13996,sam,"He should consider it, he should consider it right now."
13997,c.j.,Mitchell isn't going to get a seat on Foreign Relations.
13998,sam,There's a seat open on Appropriations.
13999,josh,Casey'll move?
14000,sam,What do you think?
14001,toby,What's going on?
14002,josh,Casey wants appropriations. And he has the seniority.
14003,sam,So he'll have to give up budget.
14004,josh,Which Taglio will jump at in a second. Which clears the way for Newberry in Senate  Armed Services.
14005,c.j.,Newberry leaving opens up Judiciary.
14006,sam,"Now, who wants to be Attorney-General under the next Republican President?"
14007,josh,Howard Weston.
14008,sam,That's right. So he takes the seat on Judiciary.
14009,josh,Vacating his seat on Foreign Relations.
14010,c.j.,"So? There's a seat open on Foreign Relations, that doesn't mean Mitchell's going to get it."
14011,sam,Yes it does.
14012,c.j.,Why?
14013,sam,Nobody else's going to want it.
14014,c.j.,Why?
14015,toby,"Because there's no money in it. Senate Foreign Relations Committee has no control over  budget so there are no lobbyists, which means there are no fundraisers."
14016,c.j.,The Constitution says 'under extraordinary circumstances'.
14017,josh,It's a Treaty that's vital to national and global security. What kind of extraordinary  circumstances do you have in mind?
14018,c.j.,These people-
14019,josh,"Sam, you've been studying this, do you think we have any chance with the new Congress?"
14020,sam,I think we have no chance with the new Congress.
14021,sam,"While I've never lived through a massive nuclear explosion, decimating all forms of life  in a two hundred mile radius, I've seen pictures. And I couldn't agree with Josh more  in his interpretation of the 'extraordinary circumstances' clause of the constitution."
14022,toby,Is Leo free now?
14023,josh, Five minutes.
14024,c.j.,"These people are gone. The 106th Congress is adjourned, twelve of them were voted out  of office. This is bad pool. You go in there now and tell the President to call a lame  duck session and he does, it's going to look like politics."
14025,toby,It is politics.
14026,c.j.,Toby.
14027,toby,Let's see Leo.
14028,c.j.,What are you going to tell the 12 people who are out there looking for new jobs?
14029,toby,They may not be done with their old ones yet.
14030,sam,Casey's gonna want Appropriations.
14031,josh,He wants budget.
14032,sam,He's on Budget.
14033,josh,That's right.
14034,sam,He's gonna want Appropriations.
14035,josh,Casey's gonna want Appropriations.
14036,sam,And he has the seniority.
14037,josh,That means he's going to have to give up the Budget place.
14038,c.j.,Taglio'll take that.
14039,sam,Which clears the way for Newberry in armed services.
14040,josh,Newberry'll take his seat on Judiciary.
14041,c.j.,Which means Weston leaves foreign relations.
14042,sam,Which is where Mitchell comes in.
14043,leo,Guys!
14044,bartlet,It's like trying to run the country with Barnum Bailey and his sister Sue.
14045,bartlet,"Leo, will it be possible for just two of them to speak at once?"
14046,leo,Toby.
14047,toby,"There was an hour and ten minute meeting with Dick Rush, Ed, Marty Beech and Henry  Rodriguez. I've never seen both political and legislative liaisons so unanimous in  a diagnosis."
14048,leo,They think you should call it.
14049,josh,Yeah.
14050,toby,"Mr. President, we have better chance of winning now than a month from now."
14051,sam,Not only that but...
14052,leo,Sam!
14053,sam,Sorry.
14054,leo,Toby.
14055,toby,"Not only that but here's what C.J. can tell the press. The world is looking to the U.S.  to ratify the Treaty first. The longer we wait, the longer it takes other countries to  ratify. The closer we get to unstable countries like Pakistan developing a nuclear threat."
14056,leo,Arguments against?
14057,sam,We might lose the vote. That'll hang around our necks for two years.
14058,josh,"The Senate'll be pissed off, they might stall confirmations."
14059,c.j.,And I can just add that a Senator Elect announcing what committee assignment he'd like  it not...
14060,c.j.,It's not what the founders would have considered an extraordinary occasion.
14061,sam,Ha. An extraordinary occasion is whatever the President says it is.
14062,josh,An extraordinary occasion...
14063,bartlet, Charlie!
14064,bartlet,Could I have a couple of aspirin and a weapon of some kind to kill people with?
14065,bartlet,Leo?
14066,leo,"Look, even when they're here in session, trying to get a hundred Senators in line is  still like getting cats to march in parade."
14067,bartlet,What do you want to do?
14068,leo,Let's get the leaderships temperature on a lame duck session. And let's also get some  kind of nose count and see where we are.
14069,toby,"C.J., leak that the President's considering calling the Senate back."
14070,c.j.,"That actually, is not going to be a problem."
14071,leo,"The source is big enough that they go with it, small enough that we're not tied to it.  Toby, get me a nose count."
14072,toby,Yeah.
14073,leo,What else?
14074,josh,The State Department wants permission to change the terminology from Rogue Nations to  State of Concern.
14075,leo,Not now. What else?
14076,toby,Medicare coverage of clinical trials.
14077,leo,Not now. What else?
14078,sam,Fraud awareness for small business owners.
14079,leo,Not now. Anything else? 
14080,leo,The four of you wait in my office.
14081,bartlet,Thank you all.
14082,bartlet,When does Konanov get here?
14083,leo,In a few minutes.
14084,bartlet,"No high level meetings, right?"
14085,leo,No.
14086,bartlet,Okay.
14087,leo,"You don't want to call this vote, then lose."
14088,bartlet,"Yeah, but this could be window."
14089,leo,Yeah.
14090,bartlet,We've got see if it's doable.
14091,leo,Yeah.
14092,bartlet,It could be doable.
14093,leo,Yeah.
14094,bartlet,You got anything more to say?
14095,leo,Not this minute.
14096,bartlet,Okay.
14097,leo,"Thank you, Mr. President."
14098,bartlet,Thank you.
14099,leo,There'll be an editorial in The Post tomorrow.
14100,c.j.,You're kidding me?
14101,leo,'The President's time isn't being used efficiently.'
14102,c.j.,It couldn't wait?
14103,leo,'Schedules are abandoned before lunchtime.'
14104,c.j.,That's four in two weeks.
14105,leo,'The West Wing resembles a high school year-book office.' And I believe I am compared  to a substitute teacher.
14106,sam,That's ridiculous.
14107,leo,"No, it's not."
14108,c.j.,Leo...
14109,leo,"Certainly not based on the display I just saw in there. So, new rules. You need an answer  from the President, you need to brief him on something, you want him the way in; I want  to see a summary on my desk. Absolutely no longer than two pages. And I want my initials  on it before you go into the Oval Office."
14110,sam,Leo.
14111,josh,A two page summary's gonna kind of cramp our style.
14112,leo,Your style could use a little cramping. Are we understood?
14113,leo,"Toby, Sam, take some meetings on the Hill tonight. Toby, concentrate on votes that can be  lost with Stensen gone. Sam, dangle reservations in front of them. C.J. start the leak."
14114,leo,"Oh, anybody happens to see Vasily Konanov in the hallways, walk in the other direction."
14115,sam,I can't unleash my full potential in a two page summary.
14116,toby,Listen to me.
14117,toby,"Listen to me. I'm going to meet with Fox and Fowler. Sam, you're gonna go to the Hill."
14118,sam,Do you think with Stensen gone...?
14119,toby,"I think with Stensen gone I can get Fox and Fowler to loosen up some votes, That is if  I can ever get them to order lunch off of the damn menu."
14120,josh,They don't order?
14121,toby,"You've never seen grown men order lunch like this. Fox and Fowler'll loosen votes.  Sam, you're up on the Hill dropping we'll consider reservations. It is not out of  the realm of possibility that that meeting gets us eight votes."
14122,josh,Their bosses want to talk to the President? He's right by the phone.
14123,toby,So this is not an unimportant meeting.
14124,sam,"Just so you know, I also have to take a 22 page position paper and summarize it in  two pages. It's gotta be done some time today."
14125,josh,"You can staff that, give it to Ainsley Hayes."
14126,sam,I can't give it to Ainsley. She's...
14127,toby,Get over it.
14128,sam,"Okay, but there are going to be nine different jokes because I asked her for help."
14129,toby,'Reservations' that's the word you're dropping when you're on the Hill. You're not to  leave the meeting in the wind. Just say the word.
14130,sam,Yeah.
14131,toby,Oh.
14132,toby,Let's be able to end this day by telling the President that he's in striking distance  and he should seriously consider the session. Let's be able to do that.   Where's C.J.?
14133,josh,Looking for a reporter to leak the story to.
14134,c.j.,I don't believe.
14135,c.j.,You guys launched another editorial.
14136,c.j.,Four in two weeks.
14137,c.j.,"Well, that's convenient."
14138,c.j.,You expect me to do nothing about it?
14139,c.j.,Look...
14140,c.j.,Any reason I can't do both?
14141,c.j.," Carol, would you get me the spokesperson of the majority  leader's office?"
14142,c.j.,Senate.
14143,c.j.,Who says?
14144,c.j., We do a great deal of business with the majority leader's office.  He leads the majority.
14145,c.j.,I believe they'll track him down.
14146,c.j., No.
14147,c.j.,Certain sources inside the White House office of legislative liaisons who decline to be named.
14148,c.j.,Take it or leave it.
14149,c.j.,Anything else?
14150,c.j.,Thank you.
14151,c.j.,Who's he?
14152,c.j.,I didn't need him.
14154,josh,"I'm not in charge of the science of ergonomics. You're going to have to find somebody  else who, you know, cares."
14156,josh, Because the SPA says the cost to small business could exceed 18  billion dollars in the first year. They'll be a huge increase in workmen's compensation  premiums. And republicans find the word ergonomics to be silly.
14158,josh,We do have a lot of pregnant teenagers and no health care.
14160,josh,Look...
14161,josh,Hang on Charlie.
14162,josh,What?
14163,josh,"I can't see him. Charlie, make sure he's not in the building."
14164,josh,Good.
14165,josh,What do you mean?
14166,josh,This is a joke?
14167,josh,He's sitting in the driveway.
14168,josh,What?
14169,josh,Really?
14170,josh,Okay.
14171,josh,Okay.
14172,sam, Yes.
14173,sam,Yes.
14174,sam,Thank you.
14175,sam,You want to work or do you want to decorate my office.
14176,sam,"Yes, I need your help."
14177,sam,Let's not a big deal out of it.
14178,sam,I don't need your help. I'm asking for your help so let's not make a federal...
14179,sam,Put the phone down.
14180,sam,That must have rolled them in the aisles back in Georgia.
14181,sam,Wherever it was you studied baton twirling.
14182,sam,"Yes, so here's the thing..."
14183,sam,A favor.
14184,sam,I have a position recommendation for the President regarding an amendment to a Congress  bill.  This memo's 22 pages long and Leo's on a streamlining kick.
14185,sam,Yes. And then I want you to skip to Toulon in a turn doll skirt.
14186,sam,Summarize it and you give it to me.
14187,sam, Thank you.
14188,sam,No.
14189,sam,In exchange for what?
14190,sam,Yes.
14191,sam,Yeah.
14192,sam,No.
14193,sam,'Cause.
14194,sam,Ainsley?
14195,sam,Look...
14196,sam," See, women think that kind of thing works, but it doesn't."
14197,sam,"I let you come to the Hill, you'll summarize my memo?"
14198,sam,Ainsley...
14199,sam,No.
14200,sam,That's fine.
14201,sam,"That's fine, too."
14202,sam,"Ainsley, what the hell...?"
14203,sam,You can't have my lunch.
14204,sam,Meet me in the lobby in an hour.
14205,sam,I'm helping her out.
14206,josh,Good.
14207,sam,You know...
14208,josh,We've got a problem.
14209,sam,What?
14210,josh,Konanov.
14211,sam,He's here?
14212,josh,In a manner of speaking.
14213,josh,Leo?
14214,leo,Yeah.
14215,josh, How you doing?
14216,leo,Good.
14217,josh,"Vasily Konanov is in the driveway, he's drunk, and he won't get out of the car until  he speaks to the President."
14218,sam,And we have a winner.
14219,leo,Are you kidding me?
14220,josh,He's sitting in the car with a woman who I imagine is either a security attache or a hooker.
14221,sam,"Please, tell me it's not..."
14222,josh," It's no one you know, Sam."
14223,leo,Have you spoken to him?
14224,josh,"I'm not allowed to speak to him. I've walked by the car a couple of times, to see what  was what."
14225,josh,"Leo, we've got to move him. Tourists are going to start to ask questions and Boris and  Natasha are going to answer them."
14226,leo,"You now have permission to talk to him. Put him in an office, dry him out, and explain  why he can't see the President."
14227,josh, Good.
14228,leo, Avoid the situation room.
14229,josh,Good safety tip. 
14230,leo, What?
14231,sam,I'm going to take Ainsley to the Hill with me for the meetings.
14232,leo,Good.
14233,sam,She wants me to teach her a couple of things.
14234,leo,Good.
14235,sam,She called me the master.
14236,leo,Get out.
14237,sam,Okay. 
14238,toby,Fellas!
14239,toby,It's pureed squash. If it's not pureed then it's just squash.
14240,toby,I'll have a New York steak and a ginger ale.
14241,toby,Just cook it.
14242,toby,We don't know yet.
14243,toby,And it would really tear the President up in side to bring them back. But I want to  talk about if he should.
14244,toby,Why not?
14245,toby,We didn't have a vote before.
14246,toby,That's right.
14247,toby,I'm saying what if there was a vote now without Stensen breathing down his neck.
14248,toby,Fox.
14249,toby,What was?
14250,toby,82% of voters want the Test Ban Treaty!
14251,toby,You were guttered by the 18%?
14252,toby,"82% of voters, Joe. 82% of voters, to say nothing of 150 nations including Russia,  China, Great Britain, France. Four countries you don't often see on the same size  of the ball."
14253,toby,Fowler?
14254,toby,What?
14255,toby,What do you...?
14256,toby,Who did we lose?
14257,toby,I don't have to make...  Who'd we lose?
14258,toby,Excuse me.
14259,leo,It happens.
14260,leo,Yeah.
14261,leo,"Well, he had an appointment, just not to meet with the President."
14262,leo,"No, he's just... yeah, he's crazy, but he's our kind of crazy so...."
14263,leo,Good.
14264,leo,Go to work.
14265,leo,Yes.
14267,leo,"Hey, Donna."
14269,leo,Sure.
14271,leo,Thank you.
14273,leo,"No, what's on your mind?"
14275,leo,Or Carpal Tunnel Syndrome.
14277,leo,We can't afford it.
14279,leo,"It costs $6 billion, Donna! Type slower!"
14280,c.j.,Yeah.
14281,leo,What have we got?
14282,c.j.,The State Department and our new vocabulary.
14283,leo,Is this the ten minute pitch or the two minute pitch?
14284,c.j., The two minute pitch!
14285,leo,Go.
14286,c.j.,"Okay, now you threw me off my game."
14287,c.j.,"No, I'm nervous now."
14288,leo,Come on.
14289,c.j.,I feel like if I run over you're going to have the orchestra throw me off.
14290,leo,"I'm getting older over here, C.J."
14291,c.j.,"State wants us to change 'rogue nations' to 'states of concern.' I say fine, it's a  symbolic gesture with no real consequence. It gains us points with allies who feel  we've been too harsh and it signals to the seven countries we're talking about that  we are open to taking positive steps in the future if they initiate reforms."
14292,leo,Any down side?
14293,c.j.,I'll feel stupid.
14294,leo,I can live with that.
14295,c.j.,You certainly have so far.
14296,leo,"Well. Hey, make sure you talk to the President by the end of the day."
14297,c.j.,"Sure, about what?"
14298,leo,Danny Concannon wants access for a three part feature about...
14299,c.j.,No!
14300,leo,No what?
14301,c.j.,No he can't have access.
14302,c.j.,"He can't have access. Leo, his editorial staff just jumped up and down on your head  yesterday, and last Thursday and the President twice before that. Four times in two  weeks! That's why everybody's walking around with a stopwatch. He gets no milk and  cookies."
14303,leo,Talk to the President at the end of the day.
14304,c.j.,Le-
14305,leo,You'll get another two minutes.
14306,c.j.,Hello?
14307,toby,We may be dead already.
14308,leo,What happened?
14309,toby,We lost one of our people.
14310,leo,Who?
14311,toby,I don't know.  I need some help on the inside. Is Tony Merino in Philadelphia?
14312,leo,I don't know.
14313,toby,I'd like to call him and see if he'll get on a train.
14314,leo,Toby?! I...
14315,toby,I want out who we lost and can we get them back.
14316,leo,"Back, Pip!"
14317,toby,We lost one of our people.
14318,leo,Who?
14319,toby,"They wouldn't tell me, Leo, I need you to..."
14320,leo,Fox and Fowler?!
14321,toby,Fox and Fowler wouldn't tell me who we lost they just said to check our back yard.
14322,leo,Who the hell...?
14323,toby,I don't know. Which is why I need to talk to Marino.
14324,leo,It's not hard enough getting new votes we need to cover...
14325,toby,"Leo, I need you to talk to Marino."
14326,leo,Toby?
14327,toby,I need you to call him and set up a meeting with me. He needs to tell me who jumped  the fence. He needs to help us bring them back.
14328,leo,"Toby, the guy lost a bad race, bloody."
14329,toby,He's going to want to come back for this.
14330,leo,I think he's going to want to sit down.
14331,toby,Not on the Test Ban Treaty. He spent four years of his life on it.
14332,leo,"He spent a lot longer than that, and it burned him in the end. He lost his seat."
14333,toby,Leo?
14334,leo,The man's done it.
14335,toby,Obviously he hasn't.
14336,leo,I set up this meeting. And what's your pitch?
14337,toby,"That this treaty want's bad. It can happen. Not only that but he can stick it to  every Pennsylvanian voters who put him out of a job and take Mitchell's knees out  before he has a chance to put his pencils in a jar. Plus, who'd we lose?"
14338,leo,I don't know who we lost?
14339,toby,He'll know.
14340,leo,Toby.
14341,toby,Leo.
14342,leo,He's been out of town for a month and a half.
14343,toby,"He'll know!  Leo, if it was anything less than pooling on the Test Ban Treaty  I wouldn't, but..."
14344,leo, Margaret!
14345,toby,Thank you.
14346,toby,Messages!
14347,toby,Why are my blinds closed?
14348,josh,"Yeah! Yeah, that deserves an explanation."
14349,josh,"Mr Konanov, Mr Konanov, yes, right in here, sir, right in here. Mr Konanov..."
14350,josh,As a matter of fact I'm the Deputy Chief of Staff.
14351,josh,"It's actually, it's a very... it's a big.... Never mind. Mr Konanov, there's protocol,  your government has a leader we deal with."
14352,josh,We do wish to deal with you but right now President Shevschuck...
14353,josh,We're in touch with the embassy as well as the Capital. We are seeking permission  to have you speak with secretary...
14354,josh,Now that's not going to happen and you damn well know it!
14355,josh,"He's drunk, in my office and I will speak to him in what ever tone pleases me.   Donna!"
14356,josh, Put two uniformed agents outside my door. Tell Leo I'm coming over.
14358,josh," Oh, how I miss the Cold War."
14359,sam,This is my fifth...
14360,sam,"This is my fifth meeting in a row, it's my last meeting on the Hill and I want to know  what it's going to take for your boss to loosen his grip."
14361,sam,If the Senator moves he frees up eight maybe ten votes. He gives political cover to  those who...
14362,sam,We'll go past it's the right thing to do and...
14363,sam,Let's just say...
14364,sam,"31 Nobel Laureates, the chairman of the joint chiefs, 150 countries on this planet, and  82% of people living in this one say the treaty makes the world a safer place."
14365,sam,You can't tell me that the chance we take with our ability to verify is not weighed by  the chance we take doing nothing at all.
14366,sam,"Right, then I'm here to ask you this..."
14367,sam,I'm here to ask you this: Is there no room for movement?
14368,sam,We consider attaching reservation.
14369,sam,Is there room for movement?
14370,sam,I'll waste more of them.
14371,sam,Yeah.
14372,leo, Margaret!
14373,leo,You got that memo?
14374,leo, Margaret?
14375,leo,What the hell are you doing?
14376,leo,Margaret?!
14377,leo, Margaret?
14378,leo,"Look at my face, right now."
14379,josh,Leo?
14380,leo,Can you keep your people in line?
14381,josh,"Well, there's been no evidence of that so far. Listen..."
14382,leo,Inside.
14383,leo,"So, what's going on?"
14384,josh,"Well, I've got the 'man who came to dinner' in my office. I'm begging the Ukrainian  embassy for help. If I don't get some soon I'm going to apply for a job at the  Ukrainian embassy."
14385,leo,"No, here's what we're going to do: All this guy wants to be able to say he met the  President while he was here."
14386,josh,He can't meet the President.
14387,leo,"He can meet the President, accidentally."
14388,josh,How can he meet the President accidentally?
14389,leo,"When I was Labor secretary we did it with the Dalai Lama. Obviously Beijing doesn't  want the President to have any diplomatic contact, so they arrange a low level meeting,  keep the door open, the President wanders by, 'Hey, how ya doing, Dalai Lama.'"
14390,josh,That's the most crazy ass thing I've ever heard.
14391,leo,It works.
14392,josh,This is how the world is run?
14393,leo,Yeah.
14394,josh,I'm sticking to domestic policy.
14395,leo,"Yeah, 'cause that has the ring of sanity to it."
14396,josh, Is Toby meeting with Merino?
14397,leo,Toby's on a mission.
14398,josh,It's the right mission. I know you're not comfortable...
14399,leo,Continuing to exert influence after the people have voted you out is an ethically  gray area for me.
14400,josh,"They're all ethically grey areas, Leo. Screw it! If we're going to have a fighting  chance, we've got to invite Marino. Marino's going to want in because..."
14401,leo,Marino's a street kid who lives for revenge.
14402,josh,I was going to say 'because Marino's devoted to the issue'.
14403,leo,"Also, we may have lost one of our guys."
14404,josh,Who?
14405,leo,Toby's going to ask Marino.
14406,josh," Hey, Norma Rae! Get in here."
14407,josh, The man's trying to run a country.
14409,leo,Not here it wouldn't.
14411,josh,The White House and Congress are exempt from the work place related laws they pass.
14413,josh,Yeah.
14415,leo,"Yeah. Josh, set it up."
14417,josh,I've got a job for you.
14419,josh,Get past it.
14421,josh,I need Vasily Konanov to meet with someone of absolutely no consequence. You're my girl.
14423,josh,I need you to meet with Vasily Konanov.
14425,josh,So the President can drop in and interrupt you.
14427,josh,No.
14429,josh,Yes.
14431,josh,Yes.
14433,josh,Yes.
14435,josh,How do you usually feel about that?
14437,josh,Donna.
14439,josh,You have enormous value to me. You have no value to Eastern Europe.
14441,josh,No.
14443,josh,That's right.
14445,josh,Yes.
14447,josh,"Well, he's drunk, and he doesn't speak a lot of English so I don't think he'll  understand much of anything at all. But set up the meeting and knock 'em dead."
14448,sam,'Can I have this muffin?'!
14449,sam,'Can I have this muffin?'!
14450,sam,I think that you'll discover that the sharpest of closing remarks'll be blunted by  asking for a muffin.
14451,sam,I have no problem with that. You did great with the reservations and politics stopping  at the water's edge was touching and then you asked permission to have a muffin.
14452,c.j.,How'd it go on the Hill?
14453,sam,Much as you'd expect. You know what I think?
14454,c.j.,What?
14455,sam,"I think Ramsey, Roanoke maybe even Greys. I think they're going to vote for it anyway."
14456,c.j.,Why?
14457,sam,'Cause Tony Marino's going to tell them to. I just named three Senators that can't get  re-elected without labor and Marino may be out of a job but he's still going to swing  a big bat with the unions.
14458,c.j.,Toby's meeting with him right now.
14459,sam,Good.
14460,c.j.,Do you think I should give Danny Concannon access for a feature?
14461,sam,Yes.
14462,c.j.,You're wrong.
14463,sam,Okay.
14464,c.j.,Why?
14465,c.j.,I'm leaving.
14466,sam, Do you have my two page summary?
14467,sam,Do you have my two page summary?
14468,sam,Could I have it?
14469,sam,Thank you.
14470,sam,You reversed my position.
14471,sam,I gave this to you to summarize and you didn't summarize it so much as you reversed  my position.
14472,sam,You reversed my position.
14473,sam,It is shorter and you reversed my position.
14474,sam,Will you step inside please?
14475,toby,Senator.
14476,toby,What'll you have?
14477,toby,I appreciate your coming down.
14478,toby,The President's thinking about calling a session.
14479,toby,It's true.
14480,toby,It's nice we found a use for our particular talents.
14481,toby,"Anyway, I had a meeting at lunch with Joe Fox and Bob Fowler, and they said we may  have lost one our guys, and I wanted to find out if it was true: who is it, and is  it important?"
14482,toby,Who is it?
14483,toby,I don't understand.
14484,toby,"I don't... Tony, I don't understand. You changed your mind...?"
14485,toby,.... I don't...
14486,toby,Tony...
14487,toby,Senator...
14488,toby,"Senator, there's no reason why you can't..."
14489,toby,Only because Mitchell painted another picture.
14490,toby,"Senator, nobody expects... you know... you're not expected to..."
14491,toby,"The whole damn world's flying apart at the equator, did you know that, Bonnie?"
14492,toby,"Why's the Test Ban Treaty so important? Well! Let me tell you. In 1974 India set off  a peaceful nuclear explosion. Indira Ghandi herself said they had no intention of  building a bomb, they just wanted to know that they could. 20 years later India set  off five nuclear explosions. Who gets nervous? Pakistan. When Pakistan get nervous,  everyone gets nervous, you know why? 'Cause we're all going to die!"
14493,sam,I know what a small business is.
14494,sam,Employee fraud.
14495,sam,Yes.
14496,sam,You reversed my position.
14497,sam,I can't believe I'm listening to a Republican tell me the government should run  background checks into peak business. In fact I can't believe I'm listening to a  Republican. Could it possibly be that most of the people you want to fingerprint  have darker skin than you do?
14498,sam,"You, listen. I, you know, I can't. Alright. Start from the beginning."
14499,sam,Yeah.
14500,sam,Take the doughnut. Start from the beginning.
14501,c.j.,Hello.
14502,c.j.,I'm supposed to see him.
14503,c.j.,Mind if I wait?
14504,c.j.,"Hey, Nimrod."
14505,c.j.,"You leaked it for me, I leaked it to you, pal. I used you like so much whatever."
14506,c.j.,"Charlie, Danny's paper, after savaging us four times in two weeks would like access  so Danny can write a three part feature."
14507,c.j.,About winning a Pulitzer Prize for writing a three part feature.
14508,c.j.,"See reporters seldom win a Pulitzer, feature writers do. And the Post has been getting  a little out paced in the hardware department lately."
14509,c.j.,Thank you.
14510,c.j.,"Good evening, Mr. President."
14511,bartlet,"No more Rouge Nations, huh?"
14512,c.j.,"Yes, sir."
14513,bartlet,Well that was easy.
14514,c.j.,Sir.
14515,bartlet,"What's doing, Claudia Jean?"
14516,c.j.,"Mr. President, the Post would like access for Danny Concannon to do a three part feature  inside the Oval Office."
14517,bartlet,"Yeah, let's do it."
14518,c.j.,"No, I don't think it's a good idea, sir."
14519,bartlet,Why not?
14520,c.j.,"Sir, after the Editorials they've run..."
14521,bartlet,"Yeah, they've been way off base."
14522,bartlet,"Not so much the second one. But the first, third and fourth were silly. And the fourth  was mean spirited."
14523,c.j.,"Exactly, so let's send them a message."
14524,bartlet,Nah.
14525,bartlet,"First of all, it wasn't Danny."
14526,c.j.,Danny is their representative. We have to stop being a punching bag and they need a  wake up call.
14527,bartlet,Nah. It's going to look petty and petulant. You know why?
14528,c.j.,Sir?
14529,bartlet,Because it's petty and petulant.
14530,c.j.,"Nobody elected this newspaper, certainly not the 48 million people who chose you to  be President."
14531,bartlet,"Yeah, but not having to run for anything tends to help with honesty and decisiveness.   Thanks, Charlie, send Danny in, would you please?"
14532,c.j.,"Mr. President, you have to send them a message."
14533,bartlet,"I really don't, C.J.  Is this personal?"
14534,c.j.,Excuse me?
14535,bartlet,"I hear things, I don't understand most of it, but I hear it."
14536,c.j.,"No, sir, it's absolutely not personal."
14537,bartlet,"He's a great reporter, and you're a great Press Secretary. And that's why it was  never going to work while the two of you had those jobs."
14538,c.j.," Sir, I..."
14539,bartlet," Hey, Danny."
14540,c.j.,You...
14541,bartlet,"Danny, I think you guys have had your heads up your asses for the last few weeks,  I hope you don't mind me saying so."
14542,bartlet,"Not only that, but I think you've been trying to bait me. Which is a waste of time,  paper and ink. I'm like 50 times smarter than any of you will ever be. I have an  election to win in two years, and I'm not about to alienate the Washington Post."
14543,bartlet,"I'll tell you what I will do, though, I'm cancelling our subscription."
14544,c.j.,"Excellent, sir. The White House buys 1100 copies of the Post everyday. Cancelling  that subscription would send a message loud and clear."
14545,bartlet,"No, I meant just mine and Abbey's. I'll borrow a copy from somebody."
14546,bartlet,"Yeah. Take it easy, Danny.  C.J.'ll give you all the access you want."
14547,c.j.,"Thank you, Mr. President."
14548,c.j.,I know about the job offer.
14549,c.j.,Known about it for a couple of days.
14550,c.j.,You don't want to be an editor?
14551,c.j.,"I know. I just thought, by taking a job outside the press room..."
14552,c.j.," Well, I have a problem, so..."
14553,c.j., Okay.
14556,bartlet,"Vasily! Vasily Konanov, why you're the last person I expected to be where they told  me to go."
14557,bartlet,"Thank you, Donna."
14558,bartlet," Thank you, gentlemen."
14559,bartlet,Vasily?
14560,bartlet, I don't know who this is.
14561,bartlet,What the hell are you doing?
14562,bartlet,"I'm not the transportation secretary. You will join the WTO when you reduce the 300%  tariff on America cars, and with a nuclear weapon pointed at my head I will not talk  to you about nuclear compatibility."
14563,bartlet,"Vasily, you're a reformer and you're going to do good things in Eastern Europe and I'm  looking forward to the day when you're President. But until that time comes, my State  Department deals with the government of the Ukraine. Now you can go home and so exactly  what you wanted to do.  To say you met with the President of the United States."
14564,bartlet, You just did.
14565,bartlet,How ya doing?
14566,leo, Yeah... yeah...
14567,leo, Doctor Zhivago is out of here.
14568,sam,Good.
14569,leo,What do you have?
14570,sam,The commerce department wants us to back an amendment to a Bill that would help  small businesses with fraud prevention and employee theft. We want to recommend it.
14571,leo,You have numbers?
14572,sam,Yeah.
14573,sam,"This is from an independent study that I have faith in. 30% of workers plan to steal  from their employers, 30% give in to occasional temptation, 5% will commit fraud  regardless of circumstances, 85% will commit fraud given the circumstances."
14574,leo,"Just out of curiosity, what are the right circumstances?"
14575,sam,"Need, opportunity and the ability to rationalize their behavior, it's called the  fraud triangle. Leo, it's going to help us out when we want to raise the minimum wage.  It's small business owners who are most opposed to wage hikes."
14576,leo,You weren't going to go the other way on this?
14577,sam,"Yeah, I was."
14578,leo,You got turned around?
14579,sam,Yeah.
14580,leo,"Okay, good. Thanks."
14581,sam,Thanks.
14582,sam,"Thank you, Leo."
14583,sam,Yeah.
14584,sam,Yeah.
14585,sam,You don't understand what?
14586,sam,"Leo said yes, we're in."
14587,sam,"Leo said yes, that's the end of meeting."
14588,sam,"Well, we play with live ammo around here. You convinced me, I convinced Leo,  Leo'll convince the President."
14589,sam,"It's a short day, Ainsley, and a big country. We've got to move fast."
14590,sam,Yup.
14591,sam,"I don't know, I'm usually not in the room when they do that."
14592,sam, Someone get her a cupcake or something.
14593,bartlet,Come.
14594,bartlet,"Thanks, you can take off for the night, Charlie, we're done."
14595,toby,"Good evening, sir."
14596,bartlet," Tony Marino's going to abstain, huh?"
14597,toby,Yeah.
14598,bartlet,"He was a great public servant, Toby, a great Senator."
14599,toby,Didn't Nembenburg say that a representative owes not just his industry but his  judgement and betrays you if he sacrifices his judgement to yours?
14600,bartlet,Yeah. and then he was voted out of office five years later by the people of Bristol.
14601,toby,"That's not the point, sir."
14602,bartlet,"I know. The fact is the opponents of the treaty are on both sides of the isle.  You've got to respect them, Toby. They're politicians and they're flying in the  face of overwhelming public opinion."
14603,toby,I have to respect senators for defying 82% of American people.
14604,bartlet,"Can I tell you something, honestly? This is one of those situations where I couldn't  give a damn what the people think. The complexities of a global arms treaty, the  technological, the military, the diplomatic nuances, it's staggering, Toby. 82% of  the people cannot possibly be expected to reach an informed decision.  You  want to call a session anyway?"
14605,toby,"No.  No. If we lose, and we will, we're out of."
14606,bartlet,Yeah.  Anything else?
14607,toby,"No, sir. Thank you, Mr. President."
14608,bartlet,"You know we forget sometimes, in all the talk about democracy we forget it's not  a democracy, it's a republic. People don't make the decisions, they choose the  people who make the decisions. Could they do a better job choosing? Yeah. But  when you consider the alternatives, anyway, Abbey's in New Hampshire, you want  to come up for a cigar?"
14609,bartlet,"The day's over, Toby. We'll live to fight another one. Come up, and I'll beat  your ass at chess."
14610,toby,"Are you baiting me, Mr. President?"
14611,bartlet,Yes.
14612,toby, Okay.
14613,bartlet," If anyone's out there, I'm signing off. Have a good night."
14614,bartlet,He wants to meet with me on the way back? 
14615,bartlet,On the way back? 
14616,bartlet,The Assistant Energy Secretary is flying to Portland in the middle of the night so he  can meet with me on Air Force One on the way back? 
14617,bartlet,The day-to-day experience of my life has changed in many ways since taking this job. 
14618,c.j.,"Before we get on the plane, let me give you a couple of additions to the passenger  manifest. Gerald Wegland, the Assistant Energy Secretary, is now on the flight, as  well as Mr. Latham, the head of The White House Military Office, or WHAMO, as we have  apparently taken - over my strong objection - to calling it.   Also, on this evening's trip are Deputy Communications Director Sam Seaborn and,  well, me. "
14619,c.j.,I am now going on the trip. 
14620,c.j.,"I'm not being punished, I'm going on the trip. "
14621,c.j., I made fun of Notre Dame. 
14622,c.j.,I usually get away with it! 
14623,c.j.,I know that now. 
14624,c.j.,"Well, I'll have a lot of time to think about that on the midnight ride to Portland,  Danny. The wheels-up is 905. We'll touch down in Portland a little before midnight  local time. "
14625,leo,Mr. President? 
14626,bartlet,How're you doing? 
14627,leo,I just got off with Bruno and Hess. 
14628,bartlet,I'm sorry? 
14629,leo,I said I just got off with Bruno and Hess. 
14630,bartlet,You didn't say 'Michigan sucks'? 
14631,leo,"No, sir. "
14632,bartlet,I thought you said 'Michigan sucks.' 
14633,leo,"No, sir. We're standing pretty close to the engines so it may have sounded like I said,  'Notre Dame is gonna get the ass-kicking they so richly deserve.' Bruno and Hess? "
14634,bartlet,Yeah. 
14635,leo,We stopped the tanker in the Gulf. 
14636,bartlet,Whose? 
14637,leo,It's Cyprus-flagged but they tracked them coming out of Qais. 
14638,bartlet,You think they've got oil? 
14639,leo,Yeah. 
14640,bartlet,We gonna board them? 
14641,leo,Yeah. 
14642,bartlet,Anything else I should know? 
14643,leo,"No, sir. "
14644,bartlet,I'll see you tomorrow night. 
14645,leo,"Have a good flight, Mr. President. "
14646,bartlet,Thank you! 
14647,bartlet,"Hey, C.J.! "
14648,c.j.,"Good evening, Mr. President. "
14649,bartlet,I think it's great you decided to make the trip. 
14650,c.j.,"I believe I was ordered to, Mr. President. "
14651,bartlet,"Yes. I remember now. You made one of your funny, funny jokes. "
14652,c.j.,"Yes, sir. "
14653,bartlet,Put it on. 
14654,c.j.,Mr. President. 
14655,bartlet,Put it on. 
14656,c.j.,"Sir, I'm wearing Max Mara. It's going to break up the... "
14657,bartlet,Put it on! 
14658,c.j.,Please let nobody see me like this. 
14659,bartlet,"Hey, photo op. "
14660,c.j.,Oh good god. 
14661,bartlet,Let's hit the sky! 
14662,josh,Did he look tired? 
14663,leo,"No, he looked fine. "
14664,josh,You told him about the tanker? 
14665,leo,"Yeah. I wish he'd cancel the event, it's a long flight. "
14666,josh,"He likes long flights, he gets to talk to everybody and think out loud. "
14667,leo,"Yeah, but then he lands. "
14668,josh,"Yeah, so... well, then he lands.  Anyway, I'm going to meet with Matt Skinner. "
14669,leo,Tonight? 
14670,josh,Yeah. 
14671,leo,He's gonna say the language in the bill doesn't prohibit. 
14672,josh,"Yeah, but it creates a Federal Definition. "
14673,leo,"Still, at the State level... "
14674,josh,Yeah. Are you sticking around tonight? 
14675,leo,The President's going to have to make a decision from the plane. 
14676,josh,Okay. I have to go. Donna is about to cease the phone. 
14677,leo,All right. 
14678,josh,Leo. He likes long plane rides. 
14679,leo,Yeah. Josh hangs up the phone. 
14680,josh,Can I have the electricity back on? 
14682,josh,Why not? 
14684,josh,Not for me. Matt Skinner's coming down from the Hill. 
14686,josh,Two minutes ago. Did you have plans? 
14688,josh,Did you? 
14690,josh,"Hey, you look GOOD! "
14692,josh,You weren't wearing that during the day today. 
14694,josh,Did you steal that dress? 
14696,josh,But you're returning it tomorrow. 
14698,josh,That's stealing! 
14700,josh,After wearing it once. 
14702,josh,"It's ""stealing""! "
14704,josh,And felonious. What are your plans? 
14706,josh,What are your plans? 
14708,josh,"No problem. You can do all those things except for the drinks, the dancing, and the  dessert. "
14710,josh,I need you to be done with dinner in an hour and five minutes. 
14712,josh,"If you wanna have sex, you'd better do it during dinner. "
14714,josh, You met him for five minutes at a party. 
14716,josh,Okay.  
14718,josh," Actually, you have NO sense about these things! You have no vibe,  you have terrible taste in men, and your desire to be coupled up will always and forever  drown out any small sense of self or self-worth that you may have. "
14720,josh,Be back by the time I'm done with Skinner! 
14721,sam,Toby? 
14722,toby,Let me see it. 
14723,sam,Could I talk to you a second? 
14724,toby,Is it done? 
14725,sam,It... it's not... it's not good. It's not going well. 
14726,toby,We've had meetings... 
14727,sam,"Yeah, Toby... "
14728,toby,For the past three weeks! 
14729,sam,I'm not confused about policy. 
14730,toby,What's the problem? 
14731,sam,I'm not writing well. I'm just... I'd rather not distribute this to the pool yet. 
14732,toby," We'll be eating in the conference room. I'll have a club sandwich, Jack Daniels  and ice. "
14733,sam,Nothing for me. 
14734,toby,You have to have something. 
14735,sam,I'm fine. 
14736,toby, Bring him a club sandwich. 
14737,toby,Nice hat. 
14738,c.j.,Shut up! 
14739,toby," Sam and I are going to work for a little bit, you'll have draft copies to  distribute to the press in about three hours. "
14740,c.j.,It was already distributed. 
14741,sam,W-what do you mean? 
14742,c.j.,It was already distributed. 
14743,sam,You have to get it back! 
14744,c.j.,I can't get it back. 
14745,c.j.,They know you're polishing it... 
14746,sam,"I'm doing more than polishing it, C.J., you've got to get it back! "
14747,c.j.,I'll tell them there's a new draft and then you should... 
14748,sam,You've got to get the old draft back! 
14749,c.j.,They're not going to read it! 
14750,sam,They might. 
14751,c.j.,So what? 
14752,sam,It's very bad writing and it's got my fingerprints all over it! 
14753,c.j., Sam! 
14754,toby,"C.J., try to get it back.  C'mon. "
14755,sam, Try to get it back? 
14756,c.j.,Uh... yeah. 
14757,c.j., We've got pasta... salad? 
14758,c.j.,I'll take it. 
14759,c.j.,Mr. President. 
14760,bartlet,What does the island of Qais mean to you? 
14761,c.j., I know it's known as a rendezvous point for Iraqi oil  smugglers. 
14762,bartlet,"About two hours ago we stopped a Cyprus-flagged ship called ""The Nicosia."" We believe  it to be carrying petroleum products out of Iraq, in violation of UN sanctions. "
14763,c.j.,What do we do when that happens? 
14764,bartlet,"We board the stip, we test a sample of the oil, we determine its point of origin and  if it's black-market, the oil company gets fined. "
14765,c.j.,Don't they also get to sell the oil? 
14766,bartlet,Yes. 
14767,c.j.,Doesn't the profit of the sale exceed the fine? 
14768,bartlet,It dramatically exceeds the fine! So what do you think we should do? 
14769,c.j.,"If you're going to have sanctions, have sanctions. There should be genuine disincentive. "
14770,bartlet,I agree. Charlie? 
14771,c.j.,What's this? 
14772,bartlet,It would please me if you would lead the press in a rendition as we pass over South Bend. 
14773,c.j.,"Yes, sir. "
14774,bartlet,"All five verses, please. "
14775,c.j., Go Irish! 
14776,bartlet,You bet your ass! 
14777,leo, Ainsley! 
14778,leo,What's with the fan? 
14779,leo,It's seventeen degrees outside. 
14780,leo,The heat's not working? 
14781,leo,Okay. 
14782,josh,"Hey, Matt. "
14783,josh,Temporarily. She's having dinner. 
14784,josh,I guy she has no future with. 
14785,josh,Because I say so. You want some coffee or something? 
14786,josh,Yeah.  It's too bad this is going to be rushed. 
14787,josh,It's too bad we're talking about this for the first time right now. 
14788,josh,Really? 
14789,josh,We know. 
14790,josh,Of course it does. 
14791,josh,That government will define marriage as a union between a man and a woman. 
14792,josh,While doing nothing to prohibit it? 
14793,josh,Matt. 
14794,josh,"When this bill was being discussed on the floor, there were some very ugly things said  about homosexuals. "
14795,josh,"They were said by members of your own party. In fact, they were said by one of the guys  who escorted you here tonight, who's sitting out in the lobby. "
14796,josh,You support this bill? 
14797,josh,Congressman... you're gay! 
14798,leo,"What's going on, Mark? "
14799,leo,"Oh, man. "
14800,leo,What else did they obstruct the deck with? 
14801,leo,From what? 
14802,leo,AK-47s. 
14803,leo,Where are we now? 
14804,leo,"There's no way this ends well. In fact, its' already over."
14805,leo,Trust me. I'll call the President.  
14806,leo,Yeah? 
14807,leo,From whom? 
14808,leo,Who's on the phone? 
14809,leo," Yes, sir? "
14810,leo,"I'm sorry, sir? "
14811,bartlet,What are we trying to do? 
14812,leo,We're trying to seize the ship and escort it to Bahrain. 
14813,bartlet,All right. The F-18 pilots? 
14814,leo,"They fire warning shots, maybe take out the propeller... "
14815,bartlet,"Leo, just so they know--it's a tanker full of crude oil. If they miss the propeller and  hit something else--- "
14816,leo,"They know. Excuse me, Mr. President.  Would you stop looking at  me like that? "
14817,bartlet,What was that? 
14818,leo,Margaret was giving me a look. 
14819,bartlet,Why? 
14820,leo,My divorce papers came today. She thinks I'm going to drink 
14821,bartlet,I didn't know that. 
14822,leo,"Don't worry about it, Mr. President. I'll keep you posted. "
14823,bartlet,Okay. Why don't I have a final draft of tomorrow morning's...? 
14824,leo,Toby and Sam are working on it. 
14825,bartlet,What's wrong with it? 
14826,leo,Sam doesn't like the writing. 
14827,bartlet,Sam wrote it. 
14828,leo,He's taking another swing. 
14829,bartlet,All right.  
14830,toby,Read it to me. 
14831,sam," 'I'm calling on all Americans, young and old, Democrat and Republican,  or none of the above, to make education a national priority.' "
14832,toby,Okay. 
14833,toby,Yeah. 
14834,sam,Also when was education not a national priority before? 
14835,toby,Right.  It's an easy fix. All we need to do is...
14836,sam,No. 
14837,toby,No what? 
14838,sam,"No, it's not an easy fix. "
14839,toby,Sam? 
14840,sam,This should...
14841,toby,Yeah? 
14842,sam,"Oratory should raise your heart rate. Oratory should blow the doors off the place. We  should be talking about not being satisfied with past solutions, we should be talking  about a permanent revolution. "
14843,toby, Where have I heard that? 
14844,sam,Permanent revolution? 
14845,toby,Yeah. 
14846,sam, I got it from a book. 
14847,toby,What book? 
14848,sam,The Little Red Book. 
14849,toby,You think we should quote Mao Tse-tung? 
14850,sam,We do need a permanent revolution. 
14851,toby,"Still, I think we'll stay away from quoting Communists. "
14852,sam,You think a Communist never wrote an elegant phrase? 
14853,toby,Sam... 
14854,sam,How do you think they got every to be Communist? 
14855,toby, Let's take a walk. 
14856,sam,"Toby, you're the one for the last six months who's been saying we need a radical  approach..."
14857,toby, Let's take a walk. 
14858,sam,Can't great oratory inspire an idea that can be implemented? 
14859,toby,"We had six months. We're not doing it half-assed, we're not doing it tonight. Let's go. "
14860,sam,Where? 
14861,toby,"Up and down the plane, get the blood flowing. "
14862,sam,Mao knew how to get the blood flowing. 
14863,toby,Let's go. 
14864,leo,"Hey, Donna. "
14866,leo,That's a nice dress. 
14868,leo,"You weren't wearing that dress earlier today, were you? "
14870,leo,Did you have a date? 
14872,leo,With who? 
14874,leo,Where'd ya eat? 
14876,leo,"Ah, good. You know what you get there? Tell Dario, the chef, that you work for me and  that you want flash-seared escolar with foie gras butter and a fresh juniper berry  gravlax on a bed of shaved fennel. You have a nice '87 Petrus with that.   What did you have? "
14878,leo,"Ah, okay. "
14880,leo,He's in the mess. 
14882,leo,"Oh, come on. "
14884,leo,Yeah.
14886,leo,Margaret worries if the sun is gonna rise. Go check in with Josh. 
14888,leo,Yeah. 
14889,josh,I know. 
14890,josh,"I know, man. "
14891,josh,"Public opinion can be wrong, Matt. The public opposed interracial marriage and school  integration. You want me to reach back into the nostalgia file? "
14892,josh, How's it different? 
14893,josh,Freedom of choice isn't a minority value just because the majority doesn't agree with  the minority's choice. 
14895,josh,Hey. 
14899,josh,Thanks. 
14900,josh,32 States have passed laws banning same-sex marriage. The States are doing a fine job  protecting themselves from a radical social agenda without a federal shield. 
14901,josh,I like you guys who want to reduce the size of government and make it just small enough  so it can fit in our bedrooms! 
14902,josh, I got time. 
14903,c.j.,How's everybody doing? 
14904,c.j.,We took off on time. 
14905,c.j.,"I'm not sure. The President had a budget meeting earlier, maybe they were expecting it  to run long, I'll find out. Listen, I'd like you to give me back the draft copies of the  morning education speech. We're going to replace them. "
14906,c.j.,Toby and Sam are doing some work. 
14907,c.j.,They're just polishing the language. 
14908,c.j.,"There isn't a policy shift, there isn't a new program, this is Sam being Sam. "
14909,c.j.,"Nothing's forced changes in the speech, there are no policy shifts and no new  initiatives, I guarantee you. Carol? "
14910,c.j., Excuse me. 
14911,c.j.," Oh, kill me now! "
14912,leo, Yeah? 
14913,leo," Mark, tell me we didn't hit anything. "
14914,leo,We boarded? 
14915,leo,Mark! 
14916,leo,How do these people think this is going to end? What is their best-case scenario? 
14917,leo,"Yeah, thanks, Mark. "
14918,leo,Margaret! 
14919,leo,Can you get me Secretaries Hutchinson and Berryhill? 
14920,leo,"And I need Air Force One the next free minute he's got, okay? "
14921,bartlet,Why? 
14922,bartlet,It's a northeastern thing? 
14923,bartlet,What about Miami and San Francisco? 
14924,bartlet,Come in! 
14925,bartlet,So pavement's going to win this battle? 
14926,bartlet,"Okay, thanks, Steve. "
14927,bartlet,"Thank you, Mike. "
14928,c.j.,Thank you. 
14929,bartlet," Ernesto Perez Balladares, former President of Panama. You know where  he went to school? Notre Dame. "
14930,c.j.,"Yes, sir, also Joe Garagiola. "
14931,bartlet,Was that a crack? 
14932,c.j.,"No, sir. I understand you'd like to hear the song now? "
14933,bartlet," Yeah, but we gotta do it later. The Tokyo Exchange just opened  and I'm gonna gauge the impact on Pacific Rim Banking Reforms. A subject economics  scholars could take years on, I will take 20 minutes. "
14934,c.j.,"Speaking of which, Mr. President, I was asked about the late departure tonight. "
14935,bartlet,I thought we left on time. 
14936,c.j.,The late scheduled departure. 
14937,bartlet,You don't like late flights? 
14938,c.j.,"No, I was just repeating- "
14939,bartlet,A long flight across the night? You know why late flights are good? Because we cease to  be earthbound and burdened with practicality. Ask the impertinent question. Talk about  the idea nobody has thought about yet.  Put it a different way. 
14940,sam,Be poets. 
14941,bartlet,If you absolutely must. 
14942,sam,Tell Toby. 
14943,toby,Sam...
14944,sam,"He doesn't want to use the phrase ""permanent revolution."" "
14945,bartlet,In education? 
14946,sam,Yes. 
14947,toby,Mr. President...
14948,bartlet,"Mao took a lot of long plane flights, Toby. Look out your window. Is there anything more  romantic than that?  "
14949,c.j.,And that's why we left at 905? 
14950,bartlet,"No, we left at 905 because they thought my budget meeting might run over. But wouldn't  that have been great if that was the reason? "
14951,sam, Yes. 
14952,bartlet," You don't like ""permanent revolution""? "
14953,toby,"It's a nifty phrase, but I think if we call for a permanent revolution, people  are, you know, gonna expect one. "
14954,bartlet,"We're flying, Toby. Live a little.  Yeah? "
14955,bartlet,"Oh, Leo, just take the damn boat... "
14981,josh,You're going to quote the bible to me? 
14982,josh,Really? 
14983,josh, Matt... 
14984,josh,The founding fathers made it very clear that they didn't want Judeo-Christian morality  within 10 city blocks of the law. Matt!  
14985,josh,"Nothing.  You understand that gay partners will be permanently ineligable for  survivor benefits, Medicare, Medicaid.... "
14986,josh,So we caught a break there.  
14987,josh,I had more notes. 
14988,c.j.,Carol? 
14989,c.j.,Did you get the old drafts back? 
14990,c.j.,Yeah. 
14991,c.j., Excuse me? 
14992,c.j.,Excuse me. 
14993,c.j.,What's the problem? 
14994,c.j.,"What's the problem, Danny? "
14995,c.j.,"Everybody else gave it back, Danny. "
14996,c.j.," I'm guaranteeing you all no substantive  changes, no new policy initiatives. "
14997,c.j.,"It was the budget meeting, by the way. "
14998,c.j.,The reason we took off late. It was the budget meeting. Although there's something to be  said for...  something to be said for... 
14999,c.j.,Nothing. 
15000,toby," ""I was raised to appreciate the value of teachers and teaching.  My grandmother, who began her teaching career in a one-room schoolhouse..."""
15001,bartlet,"Actually, it was two rooms. "
15002,toby,Okay. 
15003,bartlet,Italian stonecutters were paying her to teach their kids English in the basement of the  rectory. They put up a wall and made it two rooms as a thank you gift. 
15004,toby,We'll change it to two rooms. 
15005,bartlet,I haven't heard the big idea yet. 
15006,toby,"Sir, the speech is in pretty good shape. "
15007,bartlet,"Yeah.  What  happened to 100,000 new teachers? "
15008,toby,Sir? 
15009,bartlet,No money? 
15010,toby,No teachers. 
15011,bartlet,Toby! 
15012,toby,"There aren't a 100,000 new teachers. We can't make people be teachers. "
15013,bartlet,We can give incentives. 
15014,toby,In certain public districts there are tax incentives... 
15015,bartlet,"Well, it's not doing the trick. "
15016,toby,No. No. I know. But for right now... 
15017,sam, What's that mean? 
15018,sam,What does that mean? 
15019,sam,"You wrote down, ""Send them to college."" "
15020,sam,"What did you mean when you wrote down, ""send them to college""? "
15021,bartlet, Tuition incentives. 
15022,toby,Mr. President... 
15023,bartlet,"Talk, Charlie. "
15024,bartlet,I find fault with that formula. 
15025,bartlet,What? 
15026,sam, College tuition to anyone who wants to go college in exchange for they teach  in a public school where we send'em for three years. 
15027,bartlet,Why can't that idea be floated? 
15028,toby,Anybody know how we pay for it? 
15029,bartlet,That comes later. 
15030,toby,"Yes, it does come next, so for the moment why don't we... "
15031,bartlet,Kick this around. 
15032,toby,Mr. President... 
15033,bartlet, I'll be in my study. It's an incredible sky tonight. 
15034,josh,58% of the people say that gay spouses should receive health benefits and 54% say Social  Security benefits and by the way we haven't talked about the 14th amendment. 
15035,josh,I think a strict interpretation of the Equal Protection Clause would dictate that  homophobia can't be made into a law. 
15036,josh,Lawrence Tribe disagrees with you. 
15037,josh,Five Justices! 
15038,josh,What does that have to do with it? 
15039,josh,The Senate's not in session. The President could stick this in his pants pocket and  it's vetoed. 
15040,josh,Matt! 
15041,josh,"He compared homosexuality to kleptomania and sex addition, Matt. "
15042,josh,The Majority Leader. The leader of your own party. 
15043,josh,For cryin' out loud! 
15044,josh,How can you be a member of this party?!? 
15045,josh,This party who says that who you are is against the law. 
15046,josh,"That's a heck of a strategy, Matt. I'll bring that up in a meeting. "
15047,josh,Thanks for coming by. 
15048,toby,The speech is fine now. 
15049,sam,Toby. 
15050,toby,Speech is fine. 
15051,sam,"100,000 college scholarships... "
15052,toby,It's an overly simplistic... 
15053,sam,Toby... 
15054,c.j.,You wanted me? 
15055,sam,You should tip the press off we might float an education initiative. 
15056,c.j.," But, I just told them... "
15057,toby,We're not floating. 
15058,sam,"We might float, I'm sayin' and you should give them a heads up. "
15059,c.j.,Excuse me. I need to go look like an idiot. 
15060,toby,"We're not floating a policy initiative, Sam. I don't care if it's a trip to the moon on  gossamer wings. "
15061,sam,Look... 
15062,toby,It's pie in the sky to say nothing of patronizing to have privileged Ivy Leaguers play  teacher to America's most vulnerable children. 
15063,sam,The people taking advantage of this aren't going to be over-privileged. 
15064,toby,How do you suppose the teacher's union will feel about it? 
15065,sam,"They'll have 100,000 new members. "
15066,toby,All of whom will leave after three years. 
15067,sam,Most of whom... 
15068,toby,And the kids will be abandoned as well. 
15069,sam,They won't be abandoned. 
15070,toby,Their teachers will leave! 
15071,sam,Once you're in fifth grade what do you care what your fourth grade teacher is doing? 
15072,toby,Sam. 
15073,sam,"Toby, these people are gonna be role models, to kids that don't have much contact with  young, successful, college graduates many of whom will have grown up in neighborhoods  just like theirs. "
15074,toby,Sam. 
15075,sam,"Toby, we could have... "
15076,toby,Sam! Where are we getting the money?   Where are we getting the money? 
15077,sam,I was really mortified that I froze up on that speech. 
15078,toby,Yeah.  You should've told me a few days ago. 
15079,sam,Yeah. 
15083,josh,Talk to me about the Full Faith and Credit Clause. 
15084,josh,"So, how is the Marriage Recognition Act not unconstitutional? "
15086,josh,Yeah? 
15088,josh,Yeah? 
15089,toby,What's goin' on? 
15090,josh,I'm going to tell him to sign the damn thing. 
15091,toby,Okay. 
15092,josh,How's his mood? 
15093,toby,He's frustrated. He's feeling... 
15094,josh,"You know when he goes off on a thing Toby, he expects you to bring him in. He wants you  to do it so he doesn't have to do it himself. "
15095,toby,"Josh, off the top of your head, what do you think about tuition incentives for... "
15096,josh,What was that? 
15097,toby,We're landing. 
15098,josh,"No, I mean, what were you going to..."
15099,toby,Nothing. 
15100,josh,All right. I'll talk to you later. 
15101,josh,I'm gonna talk to Leo. 
15103,josh,Take it easy. 
15105,josh,I didn't. 
15107,josh,I'm sorry about that. 
15109,josh,Who was he? 
15111,josh,An obnoxious insurance lobbyist? What were the odds? 
15113,josh,I gotta go see Leo. 
15115,josh,"You look really great in that dress tonight, Donna. You should buy it for yourself. "
15116,bartlet, Yeah? 
15117,bartlet,Yeah?
15118,leo,We hold the ship in Bahrain. 
15119,bartlet,It doesn't do anything to hold the ship in Bahrain 
15120,leo,"Sir, we hold the ship in Bahrain and then send a sample of the oil to the U.S. customs  lab in San Francisco. If the point of origin violates sanctions... "
15121,bartlet,"Yeah. You know what's going to happen? They'll sell off the cargo in a friendly port.  780,000 metric tons of gas oil against a two million dollar fine for the oil company. "
15122,leo,Mr. President. 
15123,bartlet,Which their profits from the sale will more than cover. We're not providing much of a  disincentive to evade U.N. sanctions. 
15124,leo,What else is there to do? 
15125,bartlet,"If we're going to have sanctions at all, I think we should make them stick. I think  that we should confiscate the cargo, seize the ship, sell the oil and use the money  to beef up anti-smuggling operations. "
15126,leo,You don't mean tonight. You mean in the future... 
15127,c.j.,"We're landing, Mr. President. "
15128,bartlet, Yeah. In the future. 
15129,leo,Okay. Josh wants to talk about the... 
15130,bartlet, You need me? 
15131,c.j.,I can wait. 
15132,bartlet, Yeah. 
15133,josh,The Marriage Recognition Act. 
15134,bartlet, Yeah. 
15135,c.j.,"Folks, we'll be landing in just a few minutes. Follow the blue signs to your bus.  Oh, one thing before we land, when I said before that there'd be absolutely no policy  shifts or new initiatives in the education speech tomorrow... That was correct, except  it's possible there might be a policy shift or new initiative in the education speech  tomorrow. "
15136,toby,There isn't going to be a change. 
15137,toby,There isn't going to be a change!  Danny? 
15138,c.j.,He's not going to give it back. 
15139,toby,"Danny, Sam choked hard on the last draft and wants to burn it. "
15140,c.j., No problem? 
15141,toby,Yeah. 
15142,toby, Thanks. 
15143,c.j.,"You were just having a little go at me, weren't you? "
15144,c.j.,So you decided to kill time by... 
15145,c.j.,Tell me you went to Notre Dame. 
15146,c.j., There must be an escape hatch here of some kind. 
15147,josh,The constitutional argument... 
15148,bartlet,I don't care about the constitutional argument. It's gay bashing. It's legislative gay  bashing. How do I put my name on it? 
15149,josh,"I wouldn't, sir. I'd put it away. "
15150,bartlet,Pocket veto's a politician's way out. 
15151,josh,"They'll send the bill again when they're in session. Meanwhile, we focus on the  Employment Non-discrimination Act. "
15152,bartlet,"If I'm going to sign it in January, why am I vetoing it now? "
15153,josh,As a symbolic gesture to the gay community. 
15154,bartlet,I'm sure the gay community can't wait to thank me. 
15155,leo,Mr. President. 
15156,bartlet,This is just wrong. 
15157,leo,Yeah. 
15158,bartlet, You can look at the policy numbers and Article IV and Social Security  benefits. It doesn't matter. It's just wrong. We shouldn't be defining love and we  certainly shouldn't be ill-defining it. It's wrong. This is the job for... This is the  job of somebody else. 
15159,leo,"Well, right now it's ours. "
15160,bartlet,It's wrong. 
15161,leo,Sir. 
15162,bartlet,I should get out a rubber stamp that says 'Josiah Bartlet votes no.' 
15163,josh,That's just what the conservatives are hoping you'll do. 
15164,bartlet,I should get out a rubber stamp! 
15165,leo,Sir. 
15166,bartlet,Put it in a drawer. 
15167,leo,"Yes, sir. "
15168,josh,"Thank you, Mr. President. "
15169,leo,We'll talk at the hotel. 
15170,josh,Okay. 
15171,leo,All right. 
15172,josh,Have a good night. 
15173,leo,You too. 
15174,josh,"Hey Leo, Margaret mentioned... "
15175,leo,"Oh, come on Josh! "
15176,josh,"No, she just said... "
15177,leo,My divorce papers came today. She thinks I'm going to drink. 
15178,josh,It seems like a pretty good reason to. 
15179,leo,"I'm an alcoholic, I don't need a good reason to. "
15180,josh,You wanna have coffee someplace? 
15181,leo,I wanna go home. 
15182,josh,Okay. 
15183,leo,I'll see you on Monday. 
15184,leo," Margaret, I'm going. "
15185,leo, You're a good girl. 
15186,c.j.,Sir? 
15187,bartlet,Yeah? 
15188,c.j.,You're off the phone? 
15189,bartlet,Yeah. 
15190,bartlet,There was a question? 
15191,c.j.,"For a sidebar, on the game tomorrow. "
15192,c.j.,Why did you go to Notre Dame? 
15193,bartlet,Why not? 
15194,c.j.,"Bearing in mind that I'm just repeating someone else's question. You were accepted at  Harvard, Yale, and Williams. Why did you go to Notre Dame? "
15195,bartlet,Because I was thinking about becoming a priest. 
15196,c.j.,Really? 
15197,bartlet,Yeah. 
15198,c.j.,What happened? 
15199,bartlet,I met Abbey. 
15200,c.j., Why don't you ever give me answers like that when we're running  for something? 
15201,bartlet,Because I like to bother you. 
15202,c.j.,"Well, I shall not be defeated. "
15203,bartlet,Sit down. 
15204,c.j.,Okay.  
15205,toby,Mr. President. 
15206,bartlet,Toby. 
15207,toby,Here's the final draft. 
15208,bartlet,"Toby, you should sit down. We're landing in one minute and ten seconds. "
15209,toby,How do you know that? 
15210,bartlet,I set my watch to the cockpit computer. You should sit down. 
15211,toby,Thank you. 
15212,bartlet,Do you know why the Assistant Energy Secretary is on the plane? 
15213,toby,You have a meeting with him on the way back. 
15214,bartlet,That's right. 
15215,toby,I think Charlie's idea was a good one. I think you should ask Leo to put together a team  to study the feasibility of appropriations for a pilot program with 100 teachers. 
15216,bartlet,They're taking the tanker to Bahrain and then the company's going to make a profit. 
15217,toby,"Yes, sir. "
15218,bartlet,The Marriage Recognition Act is going to be law. 
15219,toby,Yeah. 
15220,bartlet,100 new teachers? 
15221,toby,Yeah. 
15222,bartlet,"Instead of 100,000. "
15223,toby,Yeah. 
15224,bartlet,"Well, it's a start I guess. "
15225,toby,Sam...
15226,sam,It’d be good.
15227,toby,Read the thing.
15228,sam,"By day, they churn butter and worship according to their own beliefs and by night, they  solve crimes."
15229,toby,Read the thing.
15230,sam,Pilgrim detectives.
15231,toby,Do you see me laughing?
15232,sam,I think you’re laughing on the inside.
15233,toby,Okay.
15234,sam,With the big hats.
15235,toby,Give me the speech.
15236,c.j.,"Have either of you heard of... uh, I don’t know, something, the... Jamestown Mayflower  Daughters of the American Revolution Preservation Soceity?"
15237,toby,The Jamestown Mayflower Daughters?
15238,c.j.,"I may have gotten the name wrong. They’re inviting the White House to participate in  some kind of... I don’t know, Thanksgiving Revolutionary War re-enactment."
15239,toby,"C.J., let’s not torture American History completely to death."
15240,c.j.,Who the hell are...?
15241,toby,Jamestown was the 16th century. The Mayflower landed at Plymouth in the 17th century.  The Fathers of the Daughters of the American Revolution fought in...?
15242,toby,The 18th century!
15243,c.j.,It’s a festival feast of some kind! Who cares?
15244,sam, Somebody needs to learn the true meaning of Thanksgiving.
15245,c.j.,Re-enactments and proclamations and Native American cornhusks hanging contests with native...
15246,toby,Cornhusks hanging?
15247,c.j.,Whatever. I’m the Thanksgiving cruise director around here.
15248,sam,It wasn’t like this last year?
15249,c.j.,I wasn’t here last year.
15250,sam,Where were you last year?
15251,c.j.,They sent me home last year. You don’t remember me having a 102.7-degree fever and having  all kinds of flu-like symptoms?
15252,toby,No.
15253,c.j.,"That’s ‘cause every time we come up on a holiday, you guys check out like seniors who are  done with finals."
15254,toby,We are writing a very important Thanksgiving proclamation.
15255,sam,And possibly a new action-adventure series.
15256,toby,Nobody here has checked out.
15257,josh," Hey, I was just flipping a nickel in my office. Sixteen times in a row, it  came out tails."
15258,c.j.,I’m going home.
15259,toby,Have a good night.
15260,c.j.,Yeah. Yeah.
15261,josh,Sixteen times in a row.  Yeah.
15265,toby,"What are, uh...?"
15267,toby,Yeah.
15268,josh,C.J.’s office.
15269,josh,I’d definitely put them in C.J.’s office.
15270,toby,Good idea.
15271,josh,C.J. Cregg’s office.
15272,sam,It’s right there.
15273,toby,"Well, C.J.’s office is right there..."
15274,josh,C.J. handles all the...
15275,toby,Donna will show you.
15276,josh,...birds.
15277,josh,Yeah.
15279,toby,"And Morton, Ms. Cregg is gone for the night, uh, and her office is secure, so you should  feel free to let the turkeys out of the cage, and allow them to, you know, roam freely,  as they were meant to do."
15280,josh, Absolutely.
15281,toby,Okay.
15282,josh,Show her who’s slacking off. 
15283,toby,Pizza?
15284,josh,Yeah. 
15285,josh,What’s going on?
15286,josh,Why?
15287,josh, Josh Lyman.
15288,josh,It's an 800-foot container ship called the Horizon. Eighty-three Chinese were stowed away  in containers in the hold.
15289,leo,I heard 96.
15290,josh,Thirteen of them died on the way.
15291,leo,What happened to the dead bodies?
15292,josh,They came over with the 83 lives ones. INS has them in a temporary detention facility  by the water.
15293,leo,Brief C.J.
15294,josh, You doing anything for Thanksgiving?
15295,leo,The First Family. What about you?
15296,josh,Toby and Sam and I are gonna watch football.
15297,leo,Brief C.J. on the Chinese.
15298,josh,"Yeah. Leo, do me a favor, would you? Don't tell the President we're just watching football.  He'll want to invite us for dinner."
15299,leo,"Well yes, I'm sure upon hearing the news that you're free the President of the United States  will insist that you join him for dinner."
15300,josh,"I'm just saying, we've been working hard and we'd prefer to watch football rather than  listen to a history of the yam in Latin."
15301,leo,Brief C.J.!
15302,josh,Yeah.
15303,josh,Hey!
15304,c.j.,Hello.
15305,josh,Listen...
15306,c.j.,What?
15307,josh,About a hundred Chinese stowed away in a cargo hold of a container ship. INS has them in  a temporary internment camp in San Diego.
15308,c.j.,I'll need more than that.
15309,josh,"I don't have more than that, but I will in a few minutes, so stay out of the pressroom  until you talk to me."
15310,c.j.,What about the recess appointments?
15311,josh,Toby wants to talk to you about adding a name.
15312,c.j.,Who?
15313,josh,Josephine McGarry.
15314,c.j.,Really?
15315,josh,Yeah.
15316,c.j.,Is this as a favor to Leo?
15317,josh,This is Toby sniffing around for a fight on school prayer.
15318,c.j.,He'll get one. 					 Josh hangs back as C.J. heads toward her office.
15319,c.j.,"Well, I'm gonna see what's next for me in this week of unendurable Thanksgiving nonsense."
15320,josh,Okay.
15321,c.j.,Hey Carol.
15323,c.j.,I am.
15325,c.j.,So Carol said.
15327,c.j.,Yes.
15329,c.j.,The turkeys for what?
15331,c.j.,When?
15333,c.j.,Yes.
15335,c.j.,He pardons a turkey.
15337,c.j.,"What, are there two?"
15339,c.j.,Why are there two turkeys?
15341,c.j.,No.
15343,c.j.,I don't want to know their names.
15345,c.j.,Eric and Troy.
15347,c.j.,And I'm to choose the more photogenic of the two to receive a Presidential pardon.
15349,c.j.,"Okay, I have actually a Masters degree from the University of California at Berkeley."
15351,c.j.,Yeah.
15353,c.j.,Okay. I'd like to be alone now.
15355,sam,Hey!
15356,sam,What's going on?
15357,sam,"Yes, the President takes carving knives very seriously."
15358,sam,Would you mind telling him I'm gonna need a few minutes to talk about the Chinese in  San Diego? Something's going on.
15359,sam,We're just getting it in now.
15360,bartlet,Ah!
15361,bartlet,"Yes, yes! Indeed I do."
15362,bartlet,"Chef's choice. Twice the amount of carbon, which means it'll hold a sharp edge up to  ten times longer and you can see the handle which texturized molded polymer has no  rivets or air pockets."
15363,bartlet,This is an American knife.
15364,bartlet,No German knives for us.
15365,bartlet,Good job.
15366,bartlet,Hold on.
15367,bartlet,"Nah... Nah. No, the balance isn't right."
15368,bartlet,Yeah. You know what we need?
15369,bartlet,Yeah.
15370,bartlet,You tell him they already briefed me on San Diego.
15371,bartlet,Okay.
15372,toby,Sir.
15373,bartlet,"The German's know how to make a knife, Charlie!"
15374,bartlet, Josephine McGarry?
15375,toby,She's been put on a lot of short lists. Why not pull the trigger?
15376,bartlet,She's a controversial woman.
15377,toby,That's not a flaw.
15378,bartlet,It is when it's a recess appointment. A recess appointment assumes the Senate's gonna have no  problem with the nominee. The Senate is going to have a considerable problem with this nominee.
15379,toby,That's the Senate's problem.
15380,bartlet,Toby...
15381,toby,"Mr. President, you want to have a debate on school prayer?"
15382,bartlet,"Yes, I do."
15383,toby,This'll do it.
15384,bartlet,"I got to say... look, I'm just... Toby, I'm not wild about the woman. I've known her for 25  years and I think she's all about Eve."
15385,toby,"Well, I wouldn't cast her in a play, but at the Department of Education..."
15386,leo,Good morning.
15387,toby, You want to have a debate on school prayer?
15388,bartlet,Yeah.
15389,toby,This'll start it.
15390,leo,What're we talking about?
15391,bartlet,Recess appointments.
15392,leo,I've got the final list right here.
15393,bartlet,Hey Leo...
15394,leo," ""James Alkins, Assistant Secretary of Transportation for Aviation;  Leslie Krier, Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Ecological Development; Humberto CPO  Department Administrator for the EPA..."""
15395,toby,"Leo, we're adding a name."
15396,leo,Who?
15397,bartlet,Josey.
15398,leo,No. No!
15399,bartlet,Assistant Secretary for Primary and Secondary Education.
15400,leo,Did my sister...?
15401,bartlet,We want the debate.
15402,leo,...my sister call you and ask you for this?
15403,bartlet,She did not call me.
15404,leo,I'm amazed!
15405,toby,She called me.
15406,leo,I'm less amazed. Take her name off the list.
15407,bartlet,"Not patronate, yet she's qualified."
15408,leo,Sir...
15409,toby,"Which she is. Ph.D. in education, six years as a principal, four years as superintendent  and a significant Democrat!"
15410,leo,They'll bring up school prayer.
15411,toby,No kidding.
15412,leo,"Mr. President, please don't hop on the back of Toby’s horse, it'll take you to a fight  we're not geared up for."
15413,toby,"We are geared up for it, and if we're not we should get out!"
15414,leo,Sure! You first!
15415,toby,I'll take the meetings.
15416,leo,"You're damn right, you'll take the meetings and you'll start with aides to the Republican  leadership and you'll gauge exactly the volume of dumbness with no reward we can expect!"
15417,josh,"Excuse me, Mr. President."
15418,bartlet, Take the meetings.
15419,toby,I'm very happy to.
15420,bartlet, Yeah?
15421,josh,"Mr. President, there's a wrinkle in the situation in San Diego."
15422,leo,What is it?
15423,josh,You're not gonna believe it.
15424,bartlet,What?
15425,sam,They're claiming they're Christian Evangelicals fleeing persecution.
15426,bartlet,You're kidding me.
15427,josh,They're seeking religious asylum.
15428,bartlet,You're kidding me!
15429,sam,No.
15430,josh,"The Christian community is gonna scream that they've got to stay, China's gonna say send  them back, INS is gonna say the law's a law. This is a whole new thing."
15431,bartlet,Yeah.
15432,c.j.,"Well, the INS conducts something called a “credible fear interview.” This is not a hearing  on whether or not to grant asylum, just a hearing to determine if the detainee has a  credible fear that they’ll be harmed if returned to their country."
15433,c.j.,Steve.
15434,c.j.,"Yes, we will. On the following days, we will be meeting with Reverend Al Caldwell, members  of Beijing's Embassy and INS agents. The president has asked Josh Lyman and Sam Seaborn  to run these meetings so it’s entirely possible that by week’s end we’ll have alienated  Christians, China and our own government. "
15435,c.j.,"That’s all I have on the refugees. I was going to release the list of recess appointments,  but I’m going to wait a day.  I can tell you the list has been sent to appropriate committee  chairs and I imagine one of them will leak it to you some time this afternoon. "
15436,c.j.,"I’ll also remind you that it’s Thanksgiving week, which means the traditional presidential  pardon...you know...of the chosen turkey. That will be Wednesday afternoon. Thursday morning,  the president will make his Thanksgiving proclamation in the Rose Garden. Among the guests  will be members of the Boys and Girls Clubs of America and members of the Big Brothers and  Big Sisters of America."
15437,c.j.,I’m sorry?
15438,c.j.,"Yes, of course I will be leading them in song for I am the press secretary. "
15439,c.j.,Thank you. 
15440,c.j.,I’ve got to learn some songs.
15441,josh,Don’t bring it up at the meeting.
15442,sam,Josh...
15443,josh,Don’t bring it up at the meeting.
15444,sam,A man in a threatened to blow up a theatre in the name of God!
15445,josh,Yes.
15446,sam,A theatre with people in it.
15447,josh,Yes.
15448,sam,But sending illegal Chinese immigrants back to China is objectionable.
15449,josh,Don’t bring it up at the meeting.
15450,sam,It might slip out.
15451,josh,Shove it back in.
15452,sam,Okay.
15453,josh,"Good morning, Reverend Caldwell."
15454,sam,"Good morning, reverend."
15455,josh,"Good morning everyone. Welcome. Good morning, Mary. "
15456,josh,"Okay, we’re done with good morning. "
15457,josh,The president doesn’t grant asylum requests. The INS judge does.
15458,josh,"Mary, I swear to God, you are not going to get anywhere in this building threatening me."
15459,sam,Do we know they were persecuted in China?
15460,sam,Do we know they were persecuted?
15461,sam,I believe that they are Christians. I’m asking if they were persecuted.
15462,josh,How do you know?
15463,sam,Sure you will.
15464,josh, Sam...
15465,sam,No. They will stand blithely by while religious freedom is threatened. They’re just not  doing it this time.
15466,josh,Okay.
15467,sam,"A guy writes a play called “Apostles,” in which Jesus Christ is gay, and you protest. Fine.  But when a guy threatens to blow up the theatre, you guys are nowhere to be heard from."
15468,sam,So you’re committed to religious freedom for all people unless you don’t like what they  have to say?
15469,sam,Don’t look now but I think the playwright’s headed to China.
15470,josh,Yeah. 
15471,josh,Sorry about that.
15472,josh,Sir...
15473,josh,Yes it is.
15474,josh,"Well, we may be talking about more money..."
15475,josh,"Okay. Thank you, Reverend. I’ll pass that along."
15476,toby,"Good morning, Reverend."
15477,toby,"I am, sir. "
15478,toby,You knew you were getting faxed a list of recess appointments.
15479,toby,"Article 2, section 2. “The president shall have the power to fill all vacancies that may  happen during the recess of the Senate by granting commissions which shall expire at the  end of their next session.”"
15480,toby,Slip who in?
15481,toby,I can’t help it.
15482,toby,"It’s Mr. McGarry. And her name is Dr. Josephine McGarry. She has a Ph.D. in education from  Cornell. She’s published many scholarly essays on public education. She was superintendent  of the Atlanta School District servicing 58,000 students with some of the highest test scores  in the country. What in particular troubles the senators you  work for about her resume? "
15483,toby,I do but I’d like you to say it.
15484,toby,Is she?
15485,toby,Hmm. She’s on the board of visitors at her church. She teaches Sunday mornings at the  Immaculate Heart of Mary School.
15486,toby,She’s against prayer?
15487,toby,Ah.
15488,toby,"You wanna know who else is against it? The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Organized  prayer in public schools is prohibited and your problem with her is that while superintendent,  she enforced the law."
15489,toby,"Laws don’t work like that, Wayne. We don’t ask for a show of hands."
15490,toby,"No, I don’t. Can you explain it to me slowly using small words and visual aides?"
15491,toby, Senate Reublicans will hold up confirmations of other nominees.
15492,toby,Neither is the filibuster. I’ll put down my gun when you put down yours.
15493,toby, So... hold up all the appointments you  want. Shut down the government because a teacher did as she was told. You’ll have given  us a second term and we won’t even have to leave the building. But not because I’m right  and you’re wrong. Although I am and you are. But because I am better at this than you are.
15494,toby,I’m sorry?
15495,toby,Doing what?
15496,toby,"It was a home game, there was an organized prayer and she’s breaking it up."
15497,leo,Yes she is.
15498,toby,"It's not good, but it's not, you know--"
15499,leo,"These are high school students. Two of them are on their knees praying while being  handcuffed, with my sister standing next to the cop whose hand is on his nightstick."
15500,toby, He's resting it on his nightstick.
15501,leo,I'm sure that explanation will be in the caption.
15502,toby,Leo...
15503,leo,"One of the students is wearing his marching band uniform, one of the students is black..."
15504,toby,Listen...
15505,leo,"And you say it's ""not good."""
15506,toby,"Yeah, look..."
15507,leo,That's a penetrating diagnosis from the White House Communications Director.
15508,toby,It's not like we weren't aware of the incident.
15509,leo,We didn't know there was art.
15510,toby,It's a local paper.
15511,leo,It's not local anymore!
15512,toby,Well I can save it.
15513,leo, Does she know she was submitted?
15514,toby,Yes.
15515,leo,How?
15516,toby,I called her.
15517,leo,Toby!
15518,toby,I can save this!
15519,leo,Margaret!
15520,toby,Leo...
15521,leo,"At a football game, a high school, marching band, on their knees. Don’t we think breaking  up Norman Rockwell had the cops, the handcuffs, the nightstick, and my sister."
15522,leo, Get Josephine on the phone. 
15523,leo,I begged you to go slow with this nomination.
15524,toby,The post needed...
15525,leo,The post did not desperately need to be filled. Neither the economy nor national security  nor infrastructure will collapse without an assistant secretary of primary and secondary  education.
15526,toby,It brings the problem front and center.
15527,leo,Great. And what prize do we get for that?
15528,toby,Leo...
15529,leo,What prize do we get for bringing it front and center?
15530,leo,What?
15531,toby,I'll be in my office.
15532,leo,"It brings your problem front and center, Toby. "
15533,leo,Leave the newspaper.
15534,leo,Hey Jo.
15535,c.j.,Donna.
15537,c.j.,Can I borrow you for just a minute?
15538,josh,Hey C.J.
15539,c.j.,Hey I'd love to stay around and talk with you but I have a turkey pardoning in 5 minutes.
15540,josh,I thought that was tomorrow.
15541,c.j.,No tomorrow's the singing.
15542,josh,You're singing?
15543,c.j.,I'm leading the children in song.
15544,josh,Excellent.
15545,c.j.,Yes. I need Donna for a moment.
15546,josh,You need help with the song?
15547,c.j.,I don't need help with the song. Donna?
15549,josh,Yeah.
15551,c.j.,I need help with the song.
15553,c.j.,There's a usual song?
15555,c.j.,The song.
15557,c.j.,So you know it?
15559,c.j.,I don't know it.
15561,c.j.,"Yes, right before being a National Merit Scholar."
15563,c.j.,"""Madrigals?"""
15565,c.j.,You're not the one conducting a musical on CNN.
15567,c.j.,Yes.
15569,c.j.,"Not now, right now I have, you know, actual serious work to do. "
15570,c.j.,"Okay, it's show time guys. I've observed you under a number of conditions, and this is the  final. I don't like you wigging out in the President’s face I just don't like the photo, so..."
15571,c.j.,"You both did fine. Troy, I want you know it was neck-and-neck but I'm giving it to Eric. You  were in it right to the end but it's the flapping thing you've got going on. I tell you what's  of some concern to me, had I been talking out loud this whole time, that's very unsettling."
15572,c.j.,"Okay, Eric, here we go."
15573,c.j.,"Come on Eric, let's go."
15575,c.j.,"Well I don't know where his hindquarters are and I'm not going to look that hard.  Come on Eric... Come on, down. "
15576,c.j.,Troy...
15577,josh,"$40,000 buys them a spot in a container?"
15578,sam,"How do these people have $40,000?"
15579,josh,They don't.
15580,josh,They have to pay off the smugglers when they get here so they become indentured servants. 
15581,sam,Sweatshops?
15582,josh,You should know that Al Caldwell and the Christian League have offered to pay their bonds.
15583,sam,On religious persecution?
15584,josh,It's a good alibi.
15585,josh,Thanks for coming by.
15586,josh,You too.
15587,sam,"A lot of them left their families, two months on the water, in a container, dead bodies  in there... They had to want it."
15588,c.j.,Mr. President?
15589,bartlet,Yeah?
15590,c.j.,We're all set.
15591,bartlet, What am I doing?
15592,c.j.,Pardoning a turkey.
15593,bartlet,Okay.
15594,bartlet,Excellent. 
15595,bartlet," The Missermeister. Meridian 3000 series. One-piece forged blade,  riveted palm handle."
15596,bartlet,I don't like the handles.
15597,josh,Mr. President?
15598,bartlet,How's it going?
15599,josh,"Sir, we've taken a couple dozen meetings in the last two days. "
15600,bartlet,You met with Chinese embassy officials?
15601,josh,Last night. They say...
15602,bartlet,"Christians aren't persecuted in China. Since they aren’t oppressed, they don't qualify  for refugee status."
15603,josh,Under U.S. or U.N. Conditions here.
15604,sam,"They also make the point that they broke Chinese law when the left the country illegally,  and should be sent back to the country of origin."
15605,bartlet,It's a fair point.
15606,josh,The INS agents also feel it's not uncommon in this situation for refugees to... How do I  put it... Feign faith. 
15607,bartlet,Yeah. They'll be coached.
15608,josh,So how do you tell the difference between...?
15609,bartlet,"Do you guys know what a ""shibboleth"" is?"
15610,sam,It's a catch phrase isn't it?
15611,josh,A cliché.
15612,bartlet,"It's from the Bible. ""Then said now unto him, say now “shibboleth"" and he said ""sibboleth""  for he could not frame to pronounce it right."" It was a password, the way the army used to  distinguish true Israelites from impostors sent across the river Jordan by the enemy."
15613,josh,Sir...
15614,bartlet,I'm having one of the Chinese refugees flown here. I'll meet with him tonight.
15615,c.j.," Mr. President, I can't, you know, indefinitely, with the turkey."
15616,bartlet,Yep.
15617,josh,"Excuse me, Mr. President, what are you going to ask the Chinese refugee?"
15618,bartlet,"I'm going to ask him to say ""Shibboleth."""
15619,leo,She's here?
15620,leo,Okay.
15621,leo,Yeah.
15622,leo,"No, you don't. In fact you look for them."
15623,leo,"I don't look for fights, Josey. There are enough of them to look for me."
15624,leo,And I am trying to stage manage an undisciplined White House through what I would say  was a difficult time except I haven't experienced an easy one yet. 
15625,leo,"Jo, I want you to withdraw your name from consideration."
15626,leo,You feel you can do more as superintendent in Atlanta. 
15627,leo,'Cause the President won't. And even if he would it'd look bad.
15628,leo,They got a hold of the picture.
15629,leo,You know of what.
15630,leo,"This one is special. This one is ""game's over."""
15631,leo,Yeah.
15632,leo,"A few years ago on a campaign swing through the south, I met a stringer photographer  named Odabee Jones. Was an unusual name and so I’ve remembered it. He told me he had you  to thank for starting his career in photojournalism 'cause you'd given him a head's up  when there was going to be something worth shooting. "
15633,leo,Look at the photo credit on the picture.
15634,leo,"You called the photographer! You wanted a picture taken of that.  Those kids are commendable in this day in age, those kids are phenomenal...  Now we have laws and they are difficult and they have to be enforced, and it's right  that they're enforced... but we do not strut ever! "
15635,leo, Kiss your kids hello for me.
15636,toby, She'll get over it.
15637,leo,She hasn't gotten over my making her return the stolen milk duds.
15638,toby,You were right. 
15639,leo,I know. 
15640,toby,Josey was the wrong face to put on this.
15641,leo,Yes.
15642,toby,"But I'll tell you why it should be front and center. It's not the first amendment,  it's not religious freedom, it's not church and state, it's not... abstract..."
15643,leo,What is it?
15644,toby,It's the fourth grader who gets his ass kicked at recess 'cause he sat out the voluntary  prayer in homeroom. It's another way of making kids different from other kids when they're  required by law to be there. That’s why you want it front and center; fourth grader;  that's the prize. 
15645,leo,What'd they do to you?
15646,leo,Yeah. 
15647,leo,You're right about that part. That part needs to be talked about more.
15648,toby,It does. 
15649,leo,Okay.
15650,toby,What are you doing for dinner tomorrow? 'Cause Josh and Sam and I are watching the game.
15651,leo,I'm with the First Family.
15652,toby,"Okay.  Hey Leo, do me a favor, don’t tell the President  that we're just..."
15653,leo,Oh the President could honestly give a damn what you guys are doing tomorrow Toby. 
15654,toby,Yeah... 
15655,bartlet,Is he here?
15656,bartlet,Good.
15657,leo,Did we get an interpreter?
15658,bartlet,He speaks English. He’s a chemistry professor.
15659,leo,Yeah?
15660,bartlet, There was a while there I wanted to be a chemistry professor.
15661,leo,What happened?
15662,bartlet,I never actually studied chemistry.
15663,leo,"Well, if these college chemistry departments are really demanding that way..."
15664,bartlet,Yeah.
15665,bartlet,Jhin-Wei?
15666,bartlet,I’m Jed Bartlet. This is Leo McGarry.
15667,leo,How do you do?
15668,bartlet,Thanks for coming all this way.
15669,leo, Fellas... would you mind waiting outside?
15670,bartlet,Would you care to sit down? It’s perfectly all right.
15671,bartlet," There are some sandwiches here. If you get hungry, feel free to  eat as much as you want."
15672,bartlet,There are questions as to the veracity of your claim to the asylum.
15673,bartlet,How did you become a Christian?
15674,bartlet,How do you practice?
15675,bartlet,Who’s the head of your church?
15676,bartlet,"Can you name any of Jesus’ disciples?  If you can’t, that’s okay. I usually can’t  remember the names of my kids, or for that matter..."
15677,bartlet, It was a pleasure to meet you.
15678,leo,"We’re trying to sell more 747s to China, already a big customer. We want China to crack down  on violators of American copyrights. We’re trying to get China to negotiate a settlement  with Tibet..."
15679,bartlet,Right.
15680,leo,Right.
15681,bartlet,We don’t have to grant asylum.
15682,leo,"If you’re suggesting what I think you are, you should know it happened before."
15683,bartlet,Where are they?
15684,leo,An I.N.S. detention facility in Otay-Mesa. They’re being guarded by I.N.S. agents aided  by the 22nd Division of the California National Guard.
15685,bartlet,Not the Coast Guard?
15686,leo,No.
15687,bartlet,Before... when it happened before... how did it work?
15688,leo,"Well, you don’t want to piss off China, and you want to send them back... You got to ask  yourself, how secure is the I.N.S. detention facility?"
15689,bartlet, Mrs. Landingham?
15690,bartlet,I need to talk to the Governor of California.
15691,c.j.,Carol?
15692,c.j.,We’re starting in five minutes. You can move the press to the Rose Garden.
15693,toby,Hey Toscanini.
15694,c.j.,I’m busy.
15695,toby,You’re learning the song?
15696,c.j.,I know the song.
15697,toby,You don’t know the song?
15698,c.j.,“We gather together to ask the Lord’s blessing. He chastens and hastens his will to make known.”
15699,toby,You know what it means?
15700,c.j.,I don’t have to know what it means.
15701,toby,"Listen. I don’t know what you’re doing for dinner tonight, but Josh and Sam and I..."
15702,c.j.,"It’s about damn time you asked me! I have been sitting here for two weeks turning down  all kinds of very, frankly, glamorous invitations from people I like more than you. You  can’t ask a girl at the last minute..."
15703,toby," Well, if you can’t come..."
15704,c.j.,No. I can come. I can come. I can come.
15705,toby,Good.
15706,c.j.,Should I bring anything?
15707,toby,"Yeah. Do you know how to, you know, cook food?"
15708,c.j.,We’re in the Rose Garden in five minutes.
15710,c.j.,What do you mean?
15711,c.j., No. No. These turkeys are going to a petting zoo in Delaware.
15712,c.j.,"Yeah, but I’m gonna send both of them."
15714,c.j.,"Right, but I’m gonna take them both."
15715,c.j.," I’m gonna buy them from you. What’s he, 30 bucks?"
15716,c.j.,For a turkey!?
15717,c.j.,At the Waldorf?
15718,c.j.,I’ll pay it.
15719,c.j.,Give them a different turkey.
15721,c.j.,"Yeah, and I chose Eric because Troy doesn’t like to be touched, which, surely we’re not  gonna execute him for."
15722,c.j.,"Come with me, please."
15723,c.j.,"Grab the turkey, and come with me."
15724,bartlet,"Mrs. Landingham, can I look at a copy of the Thanksgiving proclamation?"
15725,bartlet,‘Cause...
15726,bartlet,I was standing at the door.
15727,bartlet, Can I look at a copy...?
15728,bartlet,"What you got, Charles?"
15729,bartlet,Lighter weight blade.
15730,bartlet,I once test-drove the Komin Yomada.
15731,bartlet,Not wild about it--How about this?
15732,bartlet,"Because it’s something we pass on. Something with a history so we can say, “My father  gave this to me. His father gave it to him, and now I’m giving it to you.”"
15733,bartlet,I do have one.
15734,bartlet,I’m giving mine away.
15735,bartlet,Whom.
15736,bartlet,Funny you should ask.
15737,bartlet,"Charlie, my father gave this to me, and his father gave it to him, and now I’m giving it to you."
15738,bartlet,Take a look.
15739,bartlet,The fully tapered bolster allows for sharpening the entire edge of the blade.
15740,bartlet,Yeah. This was made for my family by a Boston silversmith named Paul Revere.
15741,c.j.,Mr. President?
15742,bartlet,"I’m proud of you, Charlie."
15743,bartlet,Yeah.
15744,c.j.,Mr. President.
15745,bartlet,Yeah?
15746,c.j.,Hi!
15747,bartlet,Hi.
15748,c.j.,"I’m sorry to ask you this, sir."
15749,bartlet,Not too late to stop yourself.
15750,c.j.,I need you to pardon a turkey.
15751,bartlet,I already pardoned a turkey.
15752,c.j.,I need you to pardon another one.
15753,bartlet,Didn’t I do it right?
15754,c.j.,"You did it great, but I need you to come out here and pardon another one."
15755,bartlet,Aren’t I gonna get a reputation for being soft on turkeys?
15756,c.j.,"Sir, could you come out here and just get this over with?"
15757,bartlet,"No, I’m not just gonna get this--What the hell is going on?"
15758,c.j., They sent me two turkeys. The most photo-friendly of the two gets a  Presidential pardon and a full life at a children’s zoo. The runner-up gets eaten.
15759,bartlet,"If the Oscars were like that, I’d watch."
15760,c.j.,Mr. President...
15761,bartlet,Just buy the second turkey.
15762,c.j.,They already sold it.
15763,bartlet,There’s not much I can do.
15764,c.j.,You can pardon the turkey.
15765,bartlet,The turkey hasn’t committed a crime.
15766,c.j.,Sir...
15767,bartlet,"C.J., I have really no judicial jurisdiction over birds."
15768,c.j.,"Yes, I know that, and you know that, but Morton Horn doesn’t know that."
15769,bartlet,Who’s Morton...?
15770,c.j.,He’s a high school kid from the turkey place.
15771,bartlet,He’s in high school and he doesn’t know I can’t pardon his turkey?
15772,c.j.,That’s what I’m betting.
15773,bartlet,"C.J., if we don’t and I mean completely overhaul public education in this country..."
15774,c.j.,"Yes sir, but maybe this is not the best time to..."
15775,bartlet,Where the hell is he?
15776,c.j.,Right out there.
15777,c.j.,"Morton, this is President Bartlet."
15778,bartlet,"Hey, Morton."
15779,bartlet,Well said. Is that the turkey?
15781,bartlet, You’re pardoned.
15782,c.j.,Sir...
15783,bartlet,What do you want?
15784,c.j.," Well, you know..."
15785,bartlet," By the power vested in me by the Constitution of the United States,  I hereby pardon you."
15786,bartlet,"No, it’s not okay."
15787,c.j.,Sir...
15788,bartlet,"Morton, I can’t pardon a turkey. If you think I can pardon a turkey, then you have got  to go back to your school and insist that you be better prepared to go out in the world."
15790,bartlet," No. I tell you what I can do. I’m drafting this turkey into military service.  In the meantime, somebody will be drafting a check, which will have my signature on it,  so the folks can buy themselves a Butterball."
15791,c.j.,"Donna, will you have Morton take Troy back to his pen, and remember to support his hindquarters."
15792,bartlet, What’s wrong with him?
15793,c.j.,The turkey’s hindquarters.
15794,bartlet, I’m still waiting for the thing.
15795,sam, Right here.
15796,bartlet,Let’s go in.
15797,c.j.,Sir...
15798,bartlet,Give me two minutes.
15799,c.j., I’m gonna step out there and begin the singing and lute playing.
15800,josh,I’m assuming you’ve heard?
15801,bartlet,"By the way, the Latin word for “yam” is “dioscorea.”"
15802,josh,You’ve heard.
15803,bartlet,About the Chinese refugees?
15804,sam,They escaped.
15805,bartlet,Yeah. Can you believe it?
15806,josh,"No, as a matter of fact, neither one of us can believe it, sir."
15807,bartlet,"That detention center was being guarded by the 22nd Division of the California National  Guard. Now, what does it say about our reserve army?"
15808,sam,"That 83 men, women and children who haven’t eaten in two months staged a prison break."
15809,bartlet,Let me read this.
15810,bartlet,"“Well over three and a half centuries ago, strengthened by faith and bound by a common  desire for liberty, a small band of pilgrims sought out a place in the New World where  they could worship according to their own beliefs. Now therefore I, Josiah Bartlet,  President of the United States, by virtue of authority and laws vested in me, do hereby  proclaim this to be a National Day of Thanksgiving.”"
15811,sam,"I’ll see you out there, sir. "
15812,josh,You asked the Governor to stand down the 22nd Division.
15813,bartlet," And call in the Red Cross. We didn’t do anything illegal.  We’re not involved in any massive criminal conspiracy. There’s no way I was letting  them go, and we needed to help China save face, so now they can tell their people that  the mighty American military was overpowered by..."
15814,josh,Yeah.
15815,josh,"So the guy passed the test, huh?"
15816,bartlet,"You think I would’ve sent him back if he’d failed catechism? Let me tell you something.  We can be the world’s policeman. We can be the world’s bank, the world’s factory, the  world’s farm. What does it mean if we’re not also..."
15817,bartlet,"We’ve made it into the New World, Josh. You know what I get to do now? I get to proclaim  the National Day of Thanksgiving."
15818,bartlet, This is a great job.
15819,bartlet,Galileo V. 
15820,c.j.,"Yes, sir. "
15821,bartlet,Just the name... 
15822,c.j.,Galileo V! 
15823,bartlet,You can feel the adventure. 
15824,c.j.,"Yes, indeed. "
15825,bartlet,NASA's great at naming things. 
15826,c.j.,They are. 
15827,bartlet,"Mercury, Apollo, Atlantis, the Sea of Tranquility, the Ocean of Storms... "
15828,c.j.,Good names! 
15829,bartlet,"First time I heard ‘Galileo V,’ the way the imagination immediately... It reminded me of the  way folks in my generation felt when we heard ""Yellow Submarine."" "
15830,c.j.,Okay. 
15831,bartlet,We really did all want to live in a yellow submarine. 
15832,c.j.,I can't believe they gave you people drivers' licenses. 
15833,bartlet,Tell me where we're going again. 
15834,c.j.,Mars briefing rehearsal. 
15835,bartlet,Why? 
15836,c.j.,To rehearse. 
15837,bartlet,Say the name. 
15838,c.j.,I said the name. 
15839,bartlet,"Say it again. Your imagination, like a child, will explode with unrestrained possibilities  for adventure. "
15840,c.j., Galileo V! 
15841,bartlet,You didn't say it right. 
15842,c.j.,I said it fine! 
15843,bartlet,Say it again. 
15844,sam,Who wrote this intro? 
15845,sam,You're from NASA Public Affairs? 
15846,sam,You mind if I give it a polish? 
15847,sam,"No, it's great. You mind if I change it? "
15848,sam,Just the same... 
15849,sam,"See, that's kind of what he pays me to do, so..."
15850,sam,"Yes, I suppose, if you broaden the definition to those who can’t spell. "
15851,bartlet,Good morning! 
15852,c.j.,"Sir, this is the crew from NASA Public Affairs. "
15853,bartlet,How you doing? 
15854,c.j.,"Sir, we're going to run you through the drill for tomorrow morning. First of all, you'll be  flanked on either side by the Flight Operations Manager David Narakawa and NASA Chief  Administrator Dr. Peter Jobson. On either side of them will be Dr. Samuel Thurman of the  Meteorite Analysis team from the Johnson Space Center, and Dr. Joyce Grey-Sutton, Planetary  Geologist from Cal State Northridge. On these monitors you'll be seeing the images beamed  back from the surface and on this computer screen you'll be able to read the questions being  sent in by the kids. I strongly urge you... "
15855,bartlet,Yes. 
15856,c.j.,I strongly urge you... 
15857,bartlet,I know. 
15858,c.j.,"I strongly urge you, Mr. President, to act as moderator and pass the questions of to one of  the experts on the panel rather than answer it yourself. "
15859,bartlet,Yes. 
15860,c.j.,Would you like to see some of the questions? 
15861,bartlet,We have questions in advance? 
15862,c.j.,Some of them. Would you put them on? 
15863,bartlet,"Katie, sixth grade, Green Oaks Junior High School, Austin, Texas, asks, ""How old is the planet  Mars?"" That's a great question, Katie. The planet Mars is 4.6 billion years old. "
15864,c.j.,What did I just say? 
15865,bartlet,I knew that one. 
15866,c.j.,Nobody likes a know-it-all! 
15867,bartlet,"Yes, God forbid, that while talking to 60,000 public school students, the President should  appear smart! "
15868,c.j.,That's fine. Just don't show off. 
15869,bartlet,"I don't show off.  Stevie, fourth grader, PS 31, Manhattan, asks, ""What is the  temperature on Mars?"" Well, Stevie, if one of our expert panelists were here, they would tell  you the average temperature ranges from 15 degrees to minus 140. "
15870,c.j., That happens to be wrong. It ranges from 60 to minus 225. 
15871,bartlet,I converted it to Celsius in my head. 
15872,c.j.,Thank you. 
15873,bartlet,Can I see the intro? 
15874,sam,It's up on the Prompter. 
15875,bartlet," ""Good morning! I'm speaking to you live from the West Wing of the White House. Today  we have a very unique opportunity to take part live in an extremely historic event which...""  Whoa, boy... "
15876,sam," How you doing, Mr. President?"
15877,bartlet,Who wrote this intro? 
15878,bartlet," Scott. ""Unique"" means ""one of a kind."" Something can't be very  unique, nor can it be extremely historic. "
15879,c.j.,"While we're at it, do we have to use the word ""live"" twice in the first two sentences like we  just cracked the technology? "
15880,c.j.,"We're also broadcasting in living color, right? "
15881,bartlet,Sam? 
15882,sam,Yeah. 
15883,bartlet, He's gonna make some changes. 
15884,sam,"I doubt it.  Write this: ""Good morning. Eleven months ago a 1200 pound  spacecraft blasted off from Cape Canaveral, Florida. Eighteen hours ago..."" Is it eighteen  hours ago? We're on the air at noon eastern. "
15885,c.j.,Yeah. 
15886,sam,"""Eighteen hours ago it landed on the planet Mars. You, me, and 60,000 of your fellow students  across the country along with astroscientists and engineers from the Jet Propulsion Lab in  Southern California, NASA Houston, and right here, at the White House, are going to be the  first to see what it sees, and to chronicle an extraordinary voyage of an unmanned ship  called Galileo V."" "
15887,bartlet, He said it right. 
15888,josh,"I don't understand how if it's noon in the East, and 9 Pacific, how it's 2:37 on Mars. "
15889,toby," Well, Mars is a different time zone. "
15890,josh,"Yeah, it's the 37 minutes I was... "
15891,toby,Mars rotates on it's own axis every 24 hours and 37 minutes. 
15892,josh,Ah. 
15893,toby,Have you seen this morning's news report? 
15894,josh,Yes. 
15895,toby,About green beans? 
15896,josh,I didn't... see anything about the green beans.  
15897,toby,The Milwaukee Journal is quoting an unnamed White House source as saying the President doesn't  like green beans.  
15898,josh,That's a pretty slow news day in Milwaukee. 
15899,toby,Josh... 
15900,josh,It's not gonna be picked up by... 
15901,leo, Josh! You guys done? 
15902,josh,Yeah. 
15903,leo,Walk me out. 
15904,josh,"Oh Leo, ask me how long a Martian day is. "
15905,leo,"No, I don't think I will. Toby, do you know how a stamp is chosen? "
15906,toby,A stamp? 
15907,leo,Yeah. 
15908,toby,No. 
15909,leo,You're gonna learn. 
15910,toby,Why? 
15911,leo,The Postmaster General needs your help. 
15912,toby,Why?! 
15913,leo,The Citizen's Stamp Advisory Committee has... 
15914,josh,There's a Citizen's Stamp Advisory Committee? 
15915,leo,Yes. 
15916,josh,Made up of members of the There-But-For-The-Grace-of-God-go-I Club? 
15917,leo,You want to mock people or let me talk to Toby? 
15918,josh,I want to mock people. 
15919,leo,The Citizen's Stamp Advisory Committee has recommended to the Postmaster General that  Marcus Aquino be put on the next stamp issue. 
15920,toby,You know who he is? 
15921,josh,No. 
15922,leo,He's a former Resident Commissioner of Puerto Rico and a Korean War hero. 
15923,toby,Then what's the problem? 
15924,josh,"He advocated statehood, right? "
15925,leo,Strongly advocated it. 
15926,toby,Give it to somebody else! 
15927,leo,No. 
15928,toby,Please? 
15929,leo,"This is a public face thing, and the Postmaster General wants your help! "
15930,toby,Well he can wait on a line around the block! Even while I have two of my 20 teller  windows are open! 
15931,leo,Make a recommendation by the end of the day. 
15932,toby,Yeah. 
15933,leo, What are you smiling at? 
15934,josh,"Nothing, I just... Toby got the stamp assignment.  "
15935,toby,"Leo, I might need some help. "
15936,leo,Take Josh. 
15937,toby,Thanks. 
15938,josh,"Wow, that happened fast. "
15939,c.j.,687 days. 
15940,toby,"Hey, Carol. "
15941,c.j., A Martian year is 687 days. 
15942,toby,Yes.  Did you see this morning's news report? 
15943,c.j.,I'm boning up on my Mars. 
15944,c.j.," He thinks he's so smart just because, you know, he's so smart. "
15945,toby,Did you see this morning's...?
15946,c.j.,Of course I saw the news report! I highlighted your copy! 
15947,toby,You didn't highlight the green bean story! 
15948,c.j.,"No, I thought it was best just to alert Justice Department Officials. "
15949,toby," ""An unnamed White House source..."" "
15950,c.j.,I read the story. I just didn't highlight it. 
15951,toby,You don't think this is gonna get picked up? 
15952,c.j.,No. 
15953,toby,Why not? 
15954,c.j.,It is absolutely not a story! 
15955,toby,Come see me in three hours. 
15956,c.j.,It's not a story! 
15957,toby,See me in three hours. 
15958,c.j.,How many moons does Mars have? 
15959,toby,"Two. Phobos and Deimos, the two horses that pulled his chariot. "
15960,c.j.,Get out!  
15961,toby, Three hours!
15962,c.j., Carol! 
15963,toby,She wants information on green beans. 
15964,c.j., You have work to do? 
15965,toby,I'm picking a stamp! 
15966,c.j.,Nobody likes people who know everything! 
15967,toby,So I've discovered in my life! 
15968,c.j., Get me information on green beans. 
15969,bartlet,Yeah. What else? 
15970,bartlet,"Okay, but then, let's bring the curtain down. I got a great night planned. I got two books  on Mars and one on Galileo himself. I'm gonna go to the Residence and read. "
15971,bartlet,"Nothing after 6:30. I'm gonna go to the Residence and read about Mars, which while colder  and drier, has four Earth-like seasons. "
15972,bartlet,It does! 
15973,bartlet,Since when? 
15974,bartlet,Get me Leo! 
15975,bartlet,To a concert? 
15976,bartlet,Did Buddy Holly come back? 
15977,bartlet,The Reykjavik Symphony Orchestra? 
15978,bartlet, Leo! 
15979,bartlet,"I know where Reykjavik is, Charlie. I wish I was there right now."
15980,leo," Yes, Mr. President? "
15981,bartlet,The Reykjavik Symphony Orchestra? 
15982,leo,I hear they're pretty good. 
15983,bartlet,Why do I...? 
15984,leo,Because you canceled yesterday's meeting with the Icelandic Ambassador. 
15985,bartlet,I'm being punished. 
15986,leo,"No, sir. Iceland is considering defying the ban on whale hunting, imposed by the International  Whaling Commission. They're in danger of joining Norway and Japan. There's a lucrative  international demand for fresh Icelandic mink whale meat. "
15987,bartlet,Is this a joke? 
15988,leo,No sir. Needless to say both the State Department and the Fishery Subdivision of the  Department of Agriculture feel that we shouldn't do anything to offend Iceland right now. 
15989,bartlet,"Which we did, by canceling the meeting yesterday. "
15990,leo,Apparently. 
15991,bartlet,"So to make up for it, I'm going to see the Reykjavik Symphony. "
15992,leo,"Yes, sir. "
15993,bartlet,"With, uh, Ambassador... "
15994,leo,Vigdis Olafsdottir.
15995,bartlet,Okay.
15996,leo,He's very excited to meet you. 
15997,bartlet,I'll give you a thousand dollars if you don't make me go. 
15998,leo,Think of the whales. 
15999,bartlet,Do they vote? 
16000,bartlet,Yeah. 
16001,bartlet,Send them in. 
16002,leo,This might be something. 
16003,bartlet,Why? 
16004,leo,There was an explosion in a Russian oil refinery. 
16005,bartlet,Ah. 
16006,bartlet,"Hey, Jack. Charlie. "
16007,bartlet,"Gentlemen, please. "
16008,bartlet,There was an explosion?
16009,leo,It's in the Oblast region? 
16010,bartlet,What's the problem Jack? 
16011,leo,Oh man. 
16012,bartlet,It's not a refinery fire? 
16013,leo,It's a missile silo. 
16014,bartlet,There was an explosion in a missile silo? 
16015,bartlet,"If a missile exploded, is it possible it was armed? Was there a warhead? "
16016,leo,"Half hour, Jack. "
16017,bartlet,Thank you. 
16018,bartlet,"Did they really think we weren't gonna see it, Leo? "
16019,leo,It's a cold war mentality. 
16020,bartlet,"If they asked, we could help. "
16021,leo,I wouldn't wait for the phone to ring. 
16022,bartlet,"Yeah. Yeah. Galileo Galilei. He sat in a cathedral in Pisa. He watched a lamp suspended from  the ceiling as it oscillated back and forth. He used his pulse to keep time and discovered  that the period of oscillation was independent of the size of the arc. A few years later he  contradicted the theory that a heavier body falls faster than a lighter one. Which took some  guts back in 1609, when you consider that the theory he was contradicting was Aristotle's. "
16023,leo,You want a broader theme for the classroom? 
16024,bartlet, I really do. Have Sam and C.J. come along tonight. 
16025,leo,I'll be in my office. 
16026,bartlet,Thanks. 
16027,bartlet,"He contradicted Aristotle, Charlie. "
16028,bartlet,"Yes, he did. "
16029,bartlet,Yes. What's next? 
16031,josh,What? 
16033,josh,No. 
16035,josh,I don’t. 
16037,josh,How many? 
16039,josh,Reduce it to 3. 
16041,josh,I’m sorry. What’s fun? 
16043,josh,Careful how you say that cause... 
16045,josh,Tell me what you know. 
16047,josh,"Well, that’s always our first mistake. "
16049,josh,Dork squad? 
16051,josh,Let’s put you on a stamp. 
16053,josh,Let’s talk about the problem. 
16054,c.j.,Toby. 
16055,toby, Two hours and 20 minutes. 
16056,c.j.,Yes. Let me say first that you were right and I was wrong. 
16057,toby,And the odds makers take a beating. 
16058,c.j.,When I said before no one was going to pick it up? 
16059,toby,Yes? 
16060,c.j.,Everybody’s picked it up. 
16061,toby,Yes. 
16062,c.j.,"And when I said that even if they did, it wouldn’t be a big deal? "
16063,toby,Yes? 
16064,c.j.,"Turns out, it’s a bit of a deal. "
16065,toby,Yes. 
16066,c.j.,You know where? 
16067,toby,In Oregon? 
16068,c.j.,In Oregon. You know why? 
16069,toby,Because they’re a major producer of green beans? 
16070,c.j.,"They’re a huge producer, Toby. Green beans, or snap beans, represent a significant percentage  of Oregon’s annual revenue. But here’s the thing...  "
16071,toby,There’s an electoral problem? 
16072,c.j.," There’s an electoral problem. We won Oregon by less than 10,000 votes and  we’re going to need them. "
16073,toby, Yeah. 
16074,c.j.,"Okay, well, I’m on it now. "
16075,toby,Good. 
16076,c.j.,"So, you know what? It took me two hours and 20 minutes longer to figure it out than it took you.  That doesn’t make you smarter than me. "
16077,toby,Of course not. 
16078,c.j.,Thank you. 
16079,toby,"My S.A.T. scores, on the other hand... "
16080,c.j., I’ve got to go start spinning the green bean problem. 
16081,toby,Knock ’em dead. 
16082,c.j.,I had fine S.A.T. scores. 
16083,leo,The President wants you to go with him tonight to the Kennedy Center. 
16084,c.j.,Why? 
16085,leo,He wants to discuss a theme for the closed-circuit classroom tomorrow morning. 
16086,c.j., A theme? 
16087,leo,Yeah. 
16088,c.j.,We’re landing a probe on Mars. 
16089,leo,Yeah. 
16090,c.j.,That’s the theme. 
16091,leo,He wants to discuss a broader theme. And he wants Sam there too. 
16092,c.j.,Who else? 
16093,leo,"That’s it. Oh and Mallory’s going. You, Sam, Mallory, the President and an Icelandic delegation. "
16094,c.j., Hang on. 
16095,leo,What? 
16096,c.j.,I can’t go. 
16097,leo,Why not? 
16098,c.j.,There’ll be State Department people there. 
16099,leo,Yeah? 
16100,c.j.,I just added a new deputy. Most of the people I interviewed were from State. The Kennedy  Center is going to be packed to the Potomac with people I just rejected. 
16101,leo,So is the bar at the Four Seasons. What do I...? 
16102,c.j.,Leo! 
16103,leo,Be there. Tell Sam. 
16104,c.j., Carol! 
16105,c.j.,Would you have somebody go to my apartment and pick up my blue Armani? 
16106,c.j.,And a pair of shoes. 
16107,c.j.,Sam? 
16108,sam,Yeah. 
16109,c.j.,The President wants us to go to the Kennedy Center concert tonight so we can discuss broader  themes for the televised classroom. 
16110,sam,Great! 
16111,c.j.,Great? 
16112,sam,It should be about more than rocks and average rainfall. 
16113,c.j.,"Oh God, does it rain on Mars? "
16114,sam,"No, but I’m saying.... "
16115,c.j.,The White House should develop a broader theme. 
16116,sam, That’s right and I think it’s incredible the President’s asked the two of us.  It’s a privilege and we should attack with energy due the moment. 
16117,c.j.,Mallory’s going to be there. 
16118,sam, I can’t go. 
16119,c.j.," God, Sam, I would think that faced with the privilege of attacking with  energy due the moment... "
16120,sam,Screw the moment. I can’t go. 
16121,c.j.,"Well, I’m afraid -- as we used to say in my hometown -- that’s just hard cheese. "
16122,sam,"That’s a real Algonquin Round Table you grew up with, C.J. "
16123,c.j.,"Hey, that is like the fourth time I’ve been called dumb today. "
16124,sam, ...of me and Laurie in the newspaper. I never called her and she never called me. 
16125,c.j.,You haven’t spoken to her since the picture? 
16126,sam,No. 
16127,c.j.,What about the shooting? You didn’t see her at the hospital? 
16128,sam,"No. I mean, I did, but no. She started seeing someone else. "
16129,c.j.,"Sam, didn’t I tell you not to get a crush on the boss’ daughter?  "
16130,sam,Yeah. Don’t you have a vegetable crisis to fix or something? 
16131,c.j.,Yes. 
16132,sam,Okay. 
16133,leo,But you’re ready to confirm... 
16134,bartlet,What do you think happened? 
16135,leo,You think somebody screwed up? 
16136,bartlet,Where are we with the Russian ambassador? 
16137,bartlet,"Leo, I want you to see her as soon as she can get here. Thank you everybody. "
16138,bartlet,Leo? 
16139,leo, Mike? 
16140,leo,Can you have the President’s NASA Advisor come over? 
16141,bartlet,We lost the signal from Galileo. 
16143,josh,"Yes, but we have to remain neutral. "
16145,josh,"I understand that it’s a stamp but I’m saying when it comes to statehood for Puerto Rico,  the United States has to remain neutral. "
16147,josh,"Once again, thanks for that review of fifth grade social studies. But I meant the federal  government must remain neutral. "
16149,josh,"No, it’s not. "
16151,josh,Who can’t vote. But that’s beside the point. 
16153,josh, Aquino was strongly in favor of statehood. To put his face on a  stamp would be promoting his beliefs. We can’t do that. 
16155,josh,Yes. 
16157,josh,"Oh, like it’s the first time. "
16159,josh,  Donna. 
16161,josh,Mississippi’s never minded being relegated to second-class status. 
16163,josh,"Yes, I am. "
16165,josh,"Exactly no one is worried about that. You know why?  Because Puerto Rico is absolutely  dependent on U.S. manufacturing, which contributes 40 percent to the GDP and accounts for 24  percent of their workforce. "
16167,josh,How’s it tyranny? 
16169,josh,Donna... 
16171,josh,I think we can take ‘em.  
16173,josh, We took the British. 
16175,josh,Hardly ever. 
16176,toby,Josh... 
16177,josh,What’s going on? 
16178,toby,"They know it entered the Martian atmosphere at 3:01 p.m. Eastern, which it was supposed to do. "
16179,toby,"They know it was on course traveling at a rate of 15,400 miles per hour, which it was supposed to.  Somewhere during its descent it was also supposed to release two probes -- each about the size of  a basketball -- firing them deep into the ground as part of the mission’s search for evidence of  water under surface. "
16180,josh,"We think if we hit the ground hard enough, we can make it to the center of the planet and find  water? "
16181,toby,Yeah. 
16182,josh,That’s not a theory of physics pretty much disproved by Wile E. Coyote? 
16183,toby,The probes were supposed to send a signal back to Earth through the Global Surveyor Orbiter. 
16184,josh,And we haven’t gotten the signal? 
16185,toby,"The last the flight controllers heard from Galileo was 11 minutes before landing, when all  systems were operating normally. Then it entered what they call a communications blackout  period and it hasn’t been heard from since.  I know how it feels. "
16186,josh,What are they trying? 
16187,toby,They’re... uh... trying the things they try. I’m going to give it an hour and then tell Leo  we got to cancel the classroom. 
16189,josh,Yeah? 
16191,josh," You were supposed to do this, you know. "
16192,toby,I delegated. 
16193,josh,Yeah. 
16194,c.j.,I’m late. 
16195,toby,Where are you going? 
16196,c.j.,I have to go to the Kennedy Center to be with people who don’t like me. 
16197,toby,You can do that right here. 
16198,sam,Sorry. 
16199,c.j.,We’re late. 
16200,toby, You’re going too? 
16201,c.j.,The President wants to discuss broader themes for the classroom. 
16202,toby,I don’t think there’s going to be a classroom. 
16203,c.j.,The President’s holding out hope. 
16204,sam,"In the meantime, Mallory’s going to be there with her boyfriend. And it’s going to be weird  because we haven’t spoken to one another since the picture, which was wrong, I know. But I’m  not even sure there was an implied obligation to do that. "
16205,toby,"Well, that’s 20 seconds of my life I’m never going to get back. "
16206,c.j.,Let’s go. 
16207,leo,Thanks. 
16208,leo, It wouldn’t surprise me. 
16209,leo,Madame Ambassador. 
16210,leo,Thank you for coming.  
16211,leo, Thank you. You look very nice. 
16212,leo,"Nadia, are you hitting on me? "
16213,leo, You have a fire in a missile silo. 
16214,leo,"These are Keyhole satellite photographs. Would you point, please, to the oil refinery in  these pictures? "
16215,leo,Can you tell me how an oil refinery explosion would affect national security? 
16216,leo,"No, I’m taking it up with the Russian Ambassador to the United States. Is your country ready  to deny an explosion at Sego Silo 14-D?  We know how to deal with these kinds of  emergencies. We have guys who train for it all the time. Ask us for help. "
16217,bartlet,Do you know what they’re playing? 
16218,bartlet,The Reykjavik Symphony. Do we know what they’re playing and for how long they’re playing it? 
16219,bartlet,Turn the car around. 
16220,bartlet,Turn the car around. 
16221,bartlet,Modern music sucks. Anything written after 1860 sucks. 
16222,bartlet,Sucks. 
16223,bartlet,Sucks. 
16224,bartlet,Totally blows. 
16225,bartlet,Played on teapots and gefilte fish. 
16226,bartlet,"If he wants more time, I’d be happy to take a rain check. "
16227,bartlet,This is not classical music. It is not classical music if the guy finished writing it this  afternoon. 
16228,c.j.,"Yes, sir. "
16229,bartlet,A broader theme. 
16230,c.j.,Sam and I will be talking about it. 
16231,bartlet,I don’t get that many opportunities to talk with kids. 
16232,c.j.,"Sir, at some point, I’m going to have to pull the plug to give everyone enough notice. "
16233,bartlet,"Yeah, but let’s let 'em work for a while. "
16234,c.j.,"Yes, sir. "
16235,bartlet,Where’s Sam? 
16236,c.j.,Upstairs hiding from Mallory. 
16237,bartlet,Why is he hiding from Mallory? 
16238,c.j.,Do you really want to know? 
16239,bartlet,Not at all. 
16240,c.j.,I didn’t think so. 
16241,sam,Pretty good. 
16242,sam,Benny. 
16243,sam,I’m good. 
16244,sam,And you? 
16245,sam,"Excellent.  Can I just say that I was the one who was in trouble?  I was the one under siege. It was my picture in the paper. And, I don’t know why I need to call  you and explain myself. "
16246,sam," Oh, like there aren’t any pictures of you and a call girl. "
16247,sam,"Well, that’s a crime. "
16248,sam, Yeah. Yeah. Who’s your boyfriend? 
16249,sam,What’s his name? 
16250,sam,There’s a hockey player named Richard Andrewchuk. 
16251,sam,You’re dating Richard Andrewchuk? 
16252,sam,I think you’d almost have to. 
16253,sam,What do you and Richard Andrewchuk have to talk about? 
16254,sam,"Well good, because he’s a really bad hockey player. "
16255,sam,From falling down. 
16256,bartlet,"I took trombone lessons when I was a kid. Not much solo music written for the trombone,  but I wanted to play in the marching band. "
16257,bartlet,"One afternoon, during the game, I gave it all I had and ended up throwing the slide into the  end zone, which is more than I can say for our quarterback. "
16258,bartlet,Would you excuse me just one moment? 
16259,bartlet,Galileo? 
16260,sam,"No, sir, the oil refinery. "
16261,bartlet,"Yeah, what? "
16262,sam,"You’re going to need a briefing from the Pentagon, sir. "
16263,sam,The explosion occurred while liquid nitrogen was being drained. 
16264,bartlet, What about Galileo? 
16265,sam,They’re working on it. 
16266,bartlet,Okay. 
16267,sam,I’ll get a statement ready. 
16268,bartlet,Yeah.  Somebody was draining hydrogen? 
16269,sam,Yeah. 
16270,bartlet,Yeah? 
16271,bartlet,Thanks. 
16272,c.j.,Thanks.
16273,c.j.,Yeah.
16274,c.j.,"They said modern music. I thought they meant, you know, Jackson Browne."
16275,c.j.,He used to be.
16276,c.j.,Yeah.
16277,c.j.,Yeah.
16278,c.j.,Charlie...
16279,c.j.,Why?
16280,c.j.,How did you say it?
16281,c.j.,What question did they ask?
16282,c.j.,And?
16283,c.j.,Did you leave any wiggle room?
16284,c.j.,"We won Oregon by 10,000 votes. I don’t know how many green bean farmers they have out there,  but if there are 10,001..."
16285,c.j.,This is a serious thing now.
16286,c.j.,"No, I..."
16287,c.j.,"Everybody’s stupid in an election year, Charlie."
16288,c.j.," All right. Look, just, from now on, there’s no food the President doesn’t like, okay?"
16289,c.j.,I have to take this outside.
16290,toby,Where are you right now?
16291,c.j.,I’m out in back. I’m on the terrace. I passed Gary Saunders on the way out. He booed me.  I swear to God. I passed by. He went “boo!”
16292,c.j.,He’s the Deputy Spokesperson at the Department of Energy.
16293,c.j.,"I promoted Simon Glazer. I promoted from within, Toby."
16294,toby,"Anyway, they’re hypothesizing that the thing came down at an odd angle, and that its position  might be preventing the antennae from establishing a downlink. They say it’ll take a few days  to try everything they want to try."
16295,c.j.,Days?
16296,c.j.,"Oh, God."
16297,toby," Look, if this is the worst thing that happens..."
16298,c.j.,No. Tad Whitney’s coming over to me.
16299,c.j.,"Oh, God. He’s got me in his tractor beams. He’s walking right over."
16300,c.j.,I’m not very good at confrontation.
16301,toby,You have no problem with me.
16302,c.j.,"This time of year, is the water in the Potomac very, very cold?"
16303,toby,"Yeah, but if you rub chicken fat all over yourself, it’ll insulate."
16304,c.j.,Don’t hang up. If it seems like I’m talking...
16305,c.j.,"Yeah, okay. Well, we’re gonna put those figures out at the morning briefing... Yeah. Thank you. "
16306,c.j.,I... you know... I honestly couldn’t tell you.
16307,c.j.,Yeah. There’s some stuff going on.
16308,c.j.,I gave it to Simon Glazer.
16309,c.j.,I promoted from within.
16310,c.j.,Promoting from within is very big in my family.
16311,c.j.,You’re very qualified.
16312,c.j.,"Well, no. Simon Glazer’s a man."
16313,c.j.,Hey!
16314,c.j.,"Tad, it honestly was a matter of Simon...  No! Of course it didn’t have anything to  do with... That was six weeks, five years ago."
16315,c.j.,Why you did what?
16316,c.j.,I don’t need an explanation.
16317,c.j.,"No, I didn’t think it was, Tad."
16318,c.j.,I don’t.
16319,c.j.,I’m great in bed!
16320,c.j., How you doing?
16321,c.j.,"Tad, you know, I’m sorry you didn’t get the job, but there’s really no..."
16322,c.j.,I really am.
16323,c.j.,"I have a number of problems today, and you’re not close to being any of them."
16324,c.j.,I have to go. You’re gonna get a briefing in about an hour.
16325,c.j.,A Russian missile silo.
16326,c.j.,Yeah?
16327,c.j.,"Well, when we run for reelection, I’d vote for somebody else."
16328,sam,Can you read the last part back to me?
16329,josh,“The flight manager at J.P.L. will be working round the clock until all hope is exhausted.”
16330,sam,Okay. 
16331,josh,I’ll give it to Carol.
16332,sam,Yeah.
16333,sam,Mallory?
16334,sam,"Yeah, she’s here. She snuck up on me from behind. You’d think women would make more noise  with their big high heels, but they don’t. They got this stealth thing going, which I really  ought to be clever enough--"
16335,sam,Oh my God.
16336,sam,Nothing.
16337,sam, Yeah.
16338,josh,How’s she look?
16339,sam,She looks pretty good.
16340,josh,Can you describe what she’s wearing?
16341,sam,"Well, yeah, ‘cause she’s standing right in front of me."
16342,josh,So you want to get off the phone?
16343,sam,Yeah.
16344,josh,Okay. 
16345,sam,What?
16346,sam,"I get pretty good seats as it is, Mallory. I don’t know if you noticed the motorcade I  rode over in."
16347,sam,They’ve got a lot of tests they can still try.
16348,sam,Don’t start with me.
16349,sam,"I don’t know, Mallory, but we certainly won’t divert any municipal tax dollars, which are  always best spent on new hockey arenas."
16350,sam,"There are a lot of hungry people in the world, Mal, and none of them are hungry because we  went to the moon. None of them are colder, and certainly none of them are dumber ‘cause we  went to the moon."
16351,sam,Yes.
16352,sam,"‘Cause it’s next. For we came out of the cave, and we looked over the hill, and we saw fire.  And we crossed the ocean, and we pioneered the West, and we took to the sky. The history of  man is hung on the timeline of exploration, and this is what’s next."
16353,sam,"People like you, who say that...  What?"
16354,sam,Then what the hell?
16355,sam,You know something?
16356,sam,You’re a pain in the ass.
16357,sam,"Anyway... look, about the picture..."
16358,sam,You’re not pissed?
16359,c.j., Sam?
16360,sam,Yeah?  I appreciate that. Thank you.
16361,c.j.,"Hey, Mal."
16362,c.j., Let me see what you got.
16363,sam,"This’ll be for tonight’s briefing, but doesn’t include the notes from J.P.L."
16364,c.j.,Can I talk to Jason Stark?
16365,sam,Yeah.
16367,josh,What you got there?
16369,josh,Precedent?
16371,josh,Okay.
16373,josh,"Right, and what happened?"
16375,josh,Right. What happened?
16377,josh,Yes.
16379,josh,No.
16381,josh,Look...
16383,josh,What’s a Luna Moth?
16385,josh,"No, but I’d pay good money to see that."
16387,josh,Donna...
16389,josh,Here we go.
16391,josh,"Uh, are you gonna get that?"
16393,josh,Yeah. I didn’t think we still had buffalo scouts.  Josh Lyman.
16396,josh,The President’s back.
16397,leo,Who do you want?
16398,leo,I’ll take it to the State Department. They’re not gonna want limits on the inspection team.
16399,leo,"They’ll agree to notification, if not approval."
16400,leo,Nadia...
16401,leo,Listen...
16402,bartlet, Your paranoia was a lot sexier back when you guys are communists.
16403,bartlet,"From where do you get the nerve and try to dictate terms on this? Are you insane? Your missile  regimen is in a horrifying state of disrepair. Your best-trained operators have left or died.  The ones you’ve got aren’t paid very much when they’re paid at all. They don’t have enough to  train with. Your ICBMs are well behind their warranty life. Not seven weeks ago, you mistook  a Norwegian weather rocket for a submarine launch Trident missile because the CrossTac  information never made it to the Russian C&C system.  Leo, at the time the  S.S.19 exploded, it was being drained of its liquid hydrogen in an attempt by deserting  soldiers to -- wait for it --"
16404,leo,Steal the warhead?
16405,bartlet,Steal the warhead!  When were you gonna tell us about that? You realize how dangerous...
16406,bartlet,"Well, I am concerned with the welfare of the Russian people, but that’s not what they pay  me for. You guys fall asleep in the switch in Minsk, and I’ve got a whole hemisphere hiding  under the bed. How do you not tell us this is going on? How do you not ask us for help?"
16407,bartlet,"Yeah, thanks. We’re sending in NATO inspectors."
16408,leo,"The terms are we’re sending in NATO inspectors, or he’s taking a walk to the pressroom."
16409,bartlet,Get your Foreign Minister on the phone.
16410,bartlet,I really don’t know from where you guys get the nerve.
16411,bartlet,"This is still my office, right?"
16412,toby,"Sir, we have some press things for discussion."
16413,bartlet,Nothing new from NASA?
16414,sam,"They’re testing the idea that it may have turned into what’s called a “safe mode.” If it  sensed trouble, it’s programmed to turn its systems off to avoid further damage and wait  for instructions from earth."
16415,bartlet,Earth’s giving it instructions?
16416,sam,It’s not responding.
16417,bartlet,Like my kids. All right...
16418,c.j.,"Sir, that leaves us with the televised classroom, the green beans..."
16419,josh,The stamp.
16420,c.j.,"...the stamp, and depending on who those people were that were standing near me, the  possibility of a story about me being good in bed."
16421,toby, Good in bed?
16422,c.j.,Yes.
16423,toby,Why?
16424,c.j.,Because I am.
16425,toby,Okay.
16426,bartlet,Green beans?
16427,toby, Let’s do a photo-op with the President... eating green beans.  We can drop in a quote. He’s always looking for new green bean... recipes.
16428,josh,"Next time we’re in California, we schedule a pop in Oregon, make sure nothing’s burned down."
16429,bartlet,"Yeah, okay. What about the stamp?"
16430,josh,"Here’s the thing, the Citizen’s Stamp Advisory Committee..."
16431,c.j., He doesn’t like green beans.
16432,bartlet,What?
16433,c.j.,"I’m sorry, sir. Nothing."
16434,josh,The Citizen’s Stamp Advisory Committee...
16435,c.j.,"No, I’m sorry. I said you don’t like green beans, sir."
16436,c.j.,"He doesn’t enjoy them. He doesn’t think they’re bad for you, and he doesn’t think the people  who make them are evil. They’re simply not his cup of tea. He doesn’t care for them. Why do  we think the adults of Oregon would be okay with that if put to them just that way?   And Josh, why do you think the people, adult Americans, why do  you think they can’t understand that we can honor a man’s contribution without necessarily  subscribing to his politics? They can understand a lot of things. People stopped trusting  the government during Vietnam, and it was because government stopped trusting them. It’s a  cautionary tale, Josh."
16437,josh, Okay. I was gonna say I think we should put them on a stamp.
16438,c.j.,Oh... Okay. Good.
16439,josh,Yeah.
16440,bartlet,All right. Everybody go away. We’ll call you back when there’s a NASA update.
16441,sam,Thank you.
16442,c.j.,"Thank you, Mr. President."
16443,josh,"Thank you, sir."
16444,bartlet,Did you hear the end of the concert?
16445,c.j.,I didn’t hear much of the concert at all. How was it?
16446,bartlet,"Well, first of all, let’s not kid ourselves. The Reykjavik Symphony can play. These guys have  some serious game. In this particular case, their talents were tragically misapplied to an  atonal nightmare of pretention, but after intermission..."
16447,c.j.,After intermission?
16448,bartlet,"They played a piece by a new composer. First, I wasn’t hearing it. I had 19 different things  on my mind, but then I did, and C.J., it was magnificent. It was genius. He built these themes,  and at the beginning, it was just an intellectual exercise, which is fun enough, I guess,  but then in the fourth movement, he just let it go. I really didn’t think I could be surprised  by music anymore. I thought about all the times this guy must’ve heard that his music was no  good... I’ve got to write this guy a letter."
16449,c.j.,"Mr. President, about that televised classroom tomorrow..."
16450,bartlet,I’m gonna wait up for a while. See if we hear anything. It’s out there somewhere... It’s so close.
16451,c.j.,I think you should do the classroom either way.
16452,bartlet,Yeah?
16453,c.j.,"We have, at our disposal, a captive audience of schoolchildren. Some of them don’t go to the  black board and raise their hand ‘cause they think they’re gonna be wrong. I think you should  say to these kids you think you get it wrong sometimes, you should come down here and see how  the big boys do it. I think you should tell them you haven’t given up hope, and that it may  turn up, but in the meantime, you want NASA to put its best people in the room, and you want  them to start building Galileo VI. Some of them will laugh, and most of them won’t care, but  for some, they might honestly see that it’s about going to the blackboard and raising your hand.  And that’s the broader theme."
16454,bartlet,I’ll say.
16455,c.j.,"I’ll be in my office, Mr. President."
16456,c.j.,"Yes, sir?"
16457,bartlet,You said it right that time.
16458,c.j., I’ll be in my office.
16459,bartlet,Talk to us.
16460,josh,Hi.
16461,josh,Josh Lyman.
16462,josh,Do I call you doctor?
16463,josh,Is it Dr. Keyworth?
16464,josh, And Dr...? I’m sorry?
16465,josh,I was wondering why there were two of you.
16466,josh,No.
16467,josh," I-I uh, I cut it putting down a glass."
16468,josh,Yeah.
16469,josh,Yeah.
16470,josh,Sure.
16471,josh,Yeah.
16472,josh,Yeah.
16473,josh," Tulsa, Hurricane Beth, the Chatham fires, the Iowa tornadoes, the FBI raid  in Rock Creek."
16474,josh,"Dr. Keyworth, I’m the Deputy White House Chief of Staff. I oversee 1100 White House  employees. I answer directly to Leo McGarry and the President of the United States.  Do you think you’re talking to the paperboy?"
16475,josh,In your wildest dreams did you imagine that I’d walk in this room without knowing exactly  who you are and what you do?
16476,josh,Then why did you lie to me right off the bat?
16477,josh, She’s not here training!
16478,josh,I read briefing books everyday on subjects considerably more complicated than ATVA.
16479,josh,"Yeah, but that’s not why there are two of you."
16480,josh,That’s not the reason why there are two of you.
16481,josh,"I get up, go to the bathroom, go to my office, answer the phone -- one of you watches me."
16482,josh,"Stanley, you got off to a bad start."
16483,josh,"Yes, you did."
16484,josh,You gonna lie to me this time?
16485,josh,Haven’t yet.
16486,josh,Yeah.
16487,josh,No thanks.
16488,josh,No.
16489,josh,Yeah.
16490,josh,Yeah.
16491,josh,She’s my assistant.
16492,josh,It’s Rosslyn.
16493,josh,"The shooting took place at Rosslyn, Virginia, not Rosalyn."
16494,josh,Where are you from?
16495,josh,I always thought it was San Franchisco.
16496,josh,Donna?
16497,josh,Nope.
16498,josh,Everybody was with me. We’d just gone to a Town Hall meeting. We’d just gotten off  television.
16499,josh,The President travels with a large group of people.
16500,josh,"It was geared to young people. There were Department of Education people, event staff,  obviously C.J. Cregg and the press corps, Leo McGarry was there, Bob Shanahan, Toby  Ziegler, Ziegler’s deputy Sam Seaborn, Zoey Bartlet was there obviously, Charlie Young..."
16501,josh,"Stanley, I walked out of the building, I heard gunshots, people started screaming, I woke  up in a hospital room."
16502,josh,I don’t know what you’re referring to.
16503,josh,"Well, I’ve been concerned with their behavior since long before that."
16504,josh,They were talking about the pilot.
16505,josh,"Robert Cano, the Air Force pilot."
16506,josh,I don’t know.
16507,josh,I said they may have been talking about the pilot.
16508,josh,"There was a lot going on. There was the IMF treaty, the petroleum reserves, Alaska, the  President’s..."
16509,josh,I didn’t mention the pilot for any specific reason. I was saying there was a lot  happening three weeks ago.
16510,josh,Toby!
16511,toby,Yeah?
16512,josh,What the hell’s going on?
16513,toby,What do you mean?
16514,josh,Who are these guys?
16515,toby,They’re a brass quintet.
16516,josh,I’m sorry?
16517,toby," A brass quintet... two trumpets, trombone, baritone horn, French horn. Do you  like them?"
16518,josh,Do I like them for what?
16519,toby,To play Christmas carols here in the lobby in the morning and evenings as people are  coming and going.
16520,josh,No.
16521,toby,Why?
16522,josh,Because this isn’t the Paramus mall.
16523,toby,"Let me tell you something, the last two Christmases in this White House I’ve been accused  of not being in the proper spirit. I was called names. Not this year! For the next three  weeks I will be filling this lobby with music in the mornings and evenings so that we may  all experience this season of...  Would you people  stop playing for one damn minute!"
16524,toby,This season of peace and joy.
16525,josh,Okay.
16526,toby,So what do you think?
16527,josh,They seem fine.
16528,toby,And the loose change they collect goes to pay for musical instruments in DC public schools.
16529,josh,"Toby, Ben Zaharian stepped off the reservation last night."
16530,toby,What’d he do?  You guys can keep playing.
16531,josh,He was at a Q&A at the NRDC about drilling the North Slope. He was asked if the President  would consider tapping into the SPR and he said tapping into the SPR has a lot of merit.
16532,toby,I’ll get into it.
16533,josh,Thank you. 
16534,toby,Sam!
16535,sam,Yeah.
16536,toby,Ben Zaharian did a Q&A last night and he was asked a question about the strategic  petroleum reserve.
16537,sam,And he said the SPR’s for emergencies like times of war?
16538,toby,He said tapping into the SPR has a lot of merit.
16539,sam,I’ll talk to a deputy.
16540,toby,Would you please go in and give C.J. a heads up?
16541,c.j.,...And expressed his confidence when the IMF and the World Bank meet in Prague next week  some of those restrictions will be relaxed.
16542,c.j.,Well congress isn’t in session but you mean...
16543,c.j.,He sits on the foreign ep sub committee so... Mark.
16544,c.j.,A White House tour?
16545,c.j.,I don’t know Mark. There’s a painting of Dolly Madison in the grand foyer. You catch it  in the wrong light it can scare the...
16546,c.j.,What else? Katie?
16547,c.j.,"No, it doesn’t, but I will say that a bad idea in June isn’t necessarily a bad idea in  December."
16548,c.j.,You don’t need to lower the price of heating oil during the summer. Thank you everyone.
16549,sam,Thank you.
16550,c.j.,Is somebody going to speak to somebody?
16551,sam,I’ll talk to a deputy.
16552,c.j.,Please.
16553,sam,What do you suppose that was about with the woman?
16554,c.j.,What woman?
16555,sam,The woman who went crazy on the tour?
16556,c.j.,We get about five of those a week.
16557,sam,Really?
16558,c.j.,Yeah.
16559,sam,What exactly about the White House tour makes them go crazy?
16560,c.j.,The blue blazers? You’re going to talk to someone at the energy department.
16561,sam,Yeah.
16562,josh,Good save.
16563,c.j.,Thank you. Where’s the President?
16564,josh,The situation room.
16565,c.j.,What’s going on?
16566,josh,Something about a pilot.
16567,bartlet,What’s going on? Sit down.
16568,bartlet,What does that mean?
16569,bartlet,Is he in there alone? Is there a crew?
16570,leo,The Falcon is a single seat fighter.
16571,bartlet,Did he crash?
16572,bartlet,Is there any chance he’s trying to contact the ground and can’t?
16573,leo,"Ken, what does he have up there?"
16574,bartlet,Is his intention to defect with a military asset or his intention to blow something up?
16575,bartlet,Don’t our fighter pilors have to go through some kind of psychological testing?
16576,bartlet,Let me ask a ridiculous question and I know the answer is no. Is there any way to bring  this plane down without shooting it down?
16577,bartlet,What about populated areas?
16578,bartlet,Yeah okay.
16579,josh, I’m sorry?
16580,josh,No I wasn’t in the situation room. I don’t sit in on those meetings.
16581,josh,Yeah they’d tell me a little later because I had an assignment.
16582,josh,Yeah.
16583,josh,I’m sorry if this question sounds rude but how long will we be here today?
16584,josh,I know who asked you here.
16585,josh,For the fourth time there was a lot going on that day and I’m not sure why we have to be  fixated on...
16586,josh,I was supposed to look into his personal records to figure out why he...
16587,josh,When did you find out? 
16588,leo,We were in the situation room about an hour ago. 
16589,josh,How long has he been up there? 
16590,leo,Ninety minutes since he broke formation.
16591,josh,How long before I see this on television? 
16592,leo,I'm amazed News Center 4 doesn't have their traffic helicopter up there right now. 
16593,josh,And how long before we make visual contact? 
16594,leo,About ten minutes. 
16595,josh,What do we know about the pilot? 
16596,leo,Not as much as I'd like to. 
16597,josh,Want me to get into it? 
16598,leo,Get the biographical info. How did this guy get through a fairly intense psychological  screening process? 
16599,josh,Yeah. 
16600,leo,We gave this guy an $18 million warplane. 
16601,josh,I'll get in to it. 
16602,josh,Sorry. Donna. 
16604,josh,How did you know I was going to ask you for that? 
16606,josh,Seriously. 
16608,josh,"Yeah, but to be walking by with the guy's personnel file? "
16610,josh,Oh. 
16612,josh,What do you need? 
16614,josh,What do you need? 
16616,josh, What do you need? 
16618,josh,Which one? 
16620,josh,Fine. 
16622,josh,Give me the file. 
16624,josh,To the Congressional Christmas party? 
16626,josh,Yeah. 
16628,josh,Hmm. 
16630,josh, This guy? The pilot? 
16632,josh,He's got the same birthday as me. I'll be in here. 
16633,sam,Josh. 
16634,josh,Yeah? 
16635,sam,So I spoke to Jessie Witt at Energy. 
16636,josh,Yeah. 
16637,sam,I dressed her down pretty good. 
16638,josh,They're not going to get us to change our policy on the SPR by announcing that we should  change our policy. 
16639,sam,"And I told her that, I told her that in no uncertain terms. "
16640,josh,And? 
16641,sam,I think we should change our policy. 
16642,josh,I kind of have to do this thing right now. Can we talk about it later? 
16643,sam,Yeah. 
16644,josh," You know this guy, the pilot? "
16645,sam,Yeah. 
16646,josh,We have the same birthday. 
16647,sam,"Okay, well, I'm gonna go talk to Leo about the SPR. "
16648,josh,Yeah. 
16649,c.j.,"Yeah, I asked him to come see me. "
16650,c.j.,"How you doing, Bernard? "
16651,c.j.,"That's not unusual, is it? "
16652,c.j.,I understand there was an incident on a tour. 
16653,c.j.,"Well, you should punish them for that, Bernard. "
16654,c.j.,This had to do with a painting. 
16655,c.j.,"Yeah, but it made it to the Press Room, so I just wanted to check in. "
16656,c.j.,In English? 
16657,c.j.,"Well, okay. Thanks for stopping by. "
16658,c.j.,Thank you.  
16659,c.j.,"Listen, who is Gustave Callioux, and how long has this painting been hanging outside the  Blue Room? "
16660,c.j.,What's it doing here? 
16661,c.j.,You're a snob. 
16662,bartlet,They're going to know when the F-16's have painted him before I will. 
16663,bartlet,Thank you. 
16664,bartlet,When I was in tenth grade me and my friends took my dad's Ford Country Squire for a  joyride to Vermont. He locked me in the garage till Easter. 
16665,bartlet,What do you think we should do with this pilot once we get his ass on the ground? 
16666,bartlet, No. 
16667,bartlet,What about them? 
16668,bartlet,I'm gonna sign them all by hand. 
16669,bartlet,I'm gonna sign them all by hand. 
16670,bartlet,I don't like the whole idea of the autopen. 
16671,bartlet,Let's do them all by hand. How many can there be? 
16672,bartlet,How many am I sending out? 
16673,bartlet,Seriously? 
16674,bartlet,I'm sending out 1.1 million Christmas cards?  
16675,bartlet,Who are the other million? 
16676,bartlet,I do? 
16677,bartlet,"Okay, but some of those were death threats. "
16678,bartlet,"Well, I'm not signing 1.1 million cards. "
16679,leo,Mr. President? 
16680,bartlet,1.1 million cards? 
16681,bartlet, Yeah? 
16682,leo,Situation Room. 
16683,bartlet,What happened? 
16684,josh,He was dead. 
16685,josh,"Robert Cano, yeah. Leo came and told me. "
16686,josh, What do you mean? 
16687,josh,I didn't learn anything.
16688,josh,There wasn't time. There was maybe twenty minutes between when I got the assignment and  when Leo came in. 
16689,josh,Cano? 
16690,josh,"He crashed into a mountain, Stanley. "
16691,josh,This was on the front page of the newspapers. 
16692,leo,It's over. 
16693,josh,The F-16? 
16694,leo,"Yeah, he went into a mountain north of Mexico City. "
16695,josh,Was the pilot alive when it crashed? 
16696,leo,Yeah. 
16697,josh,"We know that for sure, or we're just...?"
16698,leo,There was a radio communication. 
16699,josh,From the pilot? 
16700,leo,Yeah. 
16701,josh,What'd he say? 
16702,leo,"He said, ""It wasn't the plane."" "
16703,josh,That's it? 
16704,leo,Yeah. 
16705,josh,Okay. 
16706,leo, So what do you know? 
16707,josh,The same things you know. He's from Tallahassee. He trained at Laughlin on T-37's. 
16708,josh,Stanley. 
16709,josh,"I didn't know anything. I knew his, I knew his name, I knew his rank, uh, I knew where  he trained. I knew his missions. "
16710,josh,We had the same birthday. 
16711,josh,He's got some medals. One of them's a... Purple Heart. 
16712,leo,For what? 
16713,josh,"His plane was shot at over Bosnia. It caught fire, he ejected. "
16714,josh,Toby. 
16715,toby,Yeah. 
16716,josh,Bagpipes? 
16717,toby,Yeah. 
16718,josh,You put bagpipes in the lobby? 
16719,toby,"Not just any bagpipes, Josh. Those guys are the Duncan McTavish Clarney Highland Bagpipe  Regiment. "
16720,josh,They're a bagpipe regiment. 
16721,toby,"They're three guys from Delaware, but they can play. "
16722,josh,"Two weeks ago, it was a brass quintet; yesterday, it was the Capital Blue Plate Banjo Band. "
16723,toby,Capitol Bluegrass Banjo Brigade and those guys were featured on the local news. 
16724,josh,They're pretty loud. 
16725,toby,The bagpipes? 
16726,josh,Yeah. 
16727,toby,That's because the shepherds would need to call in the goats from high atop the hills... 
16728,josh,"Shepherds herd sheep, they don't do it in Delaware and these guys can't play in the lobby! "
16729,toby,They money that people toss in their cases will go to buy band uniforms for the  St. Mary's Assumption Marching Red Raiders. 
16730,josh,"Toby, I'm not kidding. "
16731,toby,These guys have a fourteen-song repertoire... 
16732,josh, The... bagpipes. 
16733,toby, Josh? 
16734,josh,The... bagpipes. 
16735,josh,They can't play in the lobby! 
16736,c.j.,Toby! 
16737,toby, Yeah. 
16738,c.j.,"Hang on a second. Carol, a few days ago I met with Bernard Thatch of the White House  Visitors Office. "
16739,c.j.,He said the Secret Service took a report from a woman who had some kind of an episode  on a tour? 
16740,c.j.,"Uh, hang on. I should really glance at that report, could you get it for me? "
16741,c.j.,"Toby, if I get asked the SPR question... "
16742,josh,Would it be possible to hold the noise down out here?! 
16744,josh,I... need the CBO spec. 
16745,josh,It's like a damn hockey game out here. 
16746,josh,I don't... I'm not really comfortable with that question. 
16747,josh,I understand what you meant. 
16748,josh,No. 
16749,josh,This is incredibly prosecutorial! 
16750,josh,"I think if you want to know what my friends were thinking and why they were thinking it,  you should talk to my friends. "
16751,josh,So I gather. 
16752,josh,The 19th of this month? 
16753,josh,"Stanley, to say ‘what was going on on the 19th...' the number of things that go on here  during a day... "
16754,c.j., Yeah. 
16755,josh,What are you doing? 
16756,c.j.,Eating lunch. 
16757,josh,Why is... 
16758,c.j.,Something's strange about this photograph. 
16759,josh,"Listen, why is there no more information coming about Robert Cano? "
16760,c.j.,‘Cause there's no new information. 
16761,josh,Okay.  
16762,c.j.,There isn't! 
16763,josh, You accept that? 
16764,c.j.,Yeah! 
16765,josh,A perfectly healthy air force pilot kills himself and nobody's asking why? 
16766,c.j.,"A lot of people are asking why, we just don't know why except that he obviously wasn't  perfectly healthy anymore! "
16767,josh,All right.  
16768,c.j.,Hang on.  Look at this picture. Does something in  this picture look familiar? 
16769,josh,It's a man holding a little girl. 
16770,c.j.,Look behind the man on the wall. 
16771,josh,The painting. 
16772,c.j.,Yeah. 
16773,josh,Yeah. 
16774,c.j.,It looks familiar? 
16775,josh,It's the same one that's hanging outside the Blue Room. 
16776,c.j.,Are you kidding? 
16777,josh,I need information. 
16778,c.j.,I'm going to the Blue Room. 
16780,josh,She wouldn't shut up about Yo-Yo Ma. 
16781,josh,I like the cello fine. You asked me what was going on that day and one of the things that  was going on was that Donna wouldn't shut up about Yo-Yo Ma. 
16782,josh,Yeah. 
16783,josh,Probably. 
16784,josh,Okay. 
16785,josh,It's not unusual for me to meet with the President in the Oval Office five or ten times  a day. 
16786,josh,Stanley... 
16787,josh,"Nobody was next. I... I... I don't know what you heard about this meeting, but...  It wasn't even my meeting! "
16788,bartlet,OPEC will find a way to punish us. 
16789,sam,The Saudis have announced that they'd welcome the US tapping into the SPR to calm the  market. Even the Saudis think that the price is too high. 
16790,bartlet,"If the Saudis are that concerned, why don't they just make the old faster? "
16791,sam,"Well, they're not that concerned. "
16792,bartlet,I didn't think so. 
16793,josh,It was Sam's meeting. He wanted the President to get together with his Energy and  Economic advisors on the SPR. I was only there for a political perspective. 
16794,josh,There are only two things that ever stopped the government from doing anything money or  politics. 
16795,josh,Yeah. 
16796,josh,Yeah. 
16797,josh,I'm paid to say so! 
16798,josh,I told him to...  You're not gonna understand it. 
16799,josh,You need to understand the background. 
16800,josh,To the President? 
16801,josh, No! 
16802,josh,You don't raise your voice to the President. 
16803,josh,You certainly don't do it in the Oval Office. 
16804,josh,"There's always lively discussion and the President's informal with his staff, but there's  a line you don't cross... Ever. You don't ever cross that line. "
16805,bartlet,Let's set up a meeting. 
16806,sam,"Sir, can I say... "
16807,bartlet,You sold me. We're setting up a meeting.  
16808,sam,Excellent! 
16809,josh,Can I say I think it's a bad idea? 
16810,bartlet, Why? 
16811,josh,It's not something Didion's gonna like. 
16812,bartlet,"Well, I'm just talking about a meeting, but if I decide to do it, the President controls  the SPR and not Congress. "
16813,josh,"Yeah, but Didion controls the IMF vote. "
16814,bartlet,The two aren't related. 
16815,leo,Let's move on. 
16816,josh,The two are related! 
16817,bartlet,How? 
16818,josh,Through Didion. 
16819,bartlet,I'm saying the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and forgiving the IMF debt are not related. 
16820,leo,Anything else? 
16821,josh, Of course they're related. 
16822,leo,Josh. 
16823,josh,"If Didion doesn't like that we're tapping into the SPR, he won't let the IMF debt out  of committee. "
16824,bartlet,We'll talk to him tonight. 
16825,josh,Mr. President... 
16826,bartlet,"At the Christmas party, we'll take him aside... "
16827,josh," No, sir, you can't just take him aside... "
16828,leo,"Josh, we can move on... "
16829,josh, We can't move on from it! 
16830,sam,Josh... 
16831,josh,"We can't just take him aside! If we tell him we need his help then we give him visibility  and power, and we put him in a position to say ‘no' and be a hero to his party! Who  wouldn't want to do that for a living? "
16832,bartlet,"Josh, Didion's a good guy, we can talk to him. "
16833,josh,"You need to listen to me. You have to listen to me. I can't help you, unless you listen  to me! You can't send Christmas cards to everyone, you can't do it!  Forget the  SPR, let's get the IMF loans like we said we were going to, listen to what I have to say  about Didion, and please, listen to me! "
16834,sam,Josh. 
16835,josh,"All right, let's move on. "
16836,leo,"Josh, go wait in my office, would you? "
16837,josh,"I suppose if it's just a meeting, we... "
16838,leo,Wait in my office. 
16839,josh,Okay. 
16840,bartlet,We'll talk with Didion tonight? 
16841,leo,Yeah. 
16842,bartlet,"By the way, it's not intervention in a free market if that's what he's worried about. "
16843,sam,I agree! 
16844,bartlet,It's not free trade if the price of oil is being controlled by a cartel. 
16845,leo,No. 
16846,bartlet,"Sam, you'll be in on this? "
16847,sam,"Yes, sir. "
16848,bartlet,Thank you. 
16849,sam,"Thank you, Mr. President. "
16850,leo,Have you ever heard of ATVA? 
16851,josh,Leo... 
16852,leo,I'm here. 
16853,josh,I think I should go back in there. 
16854,leo,It's the American Trauma Victims Association. 
16855,josh,Leo... 
16856,leo,"We call them in to treat trauma victims, specifically with... "
16857,josh,I know what ATVA is. 
16858,leo,You're gonna sit with a guy. 
16859,josh,Leo... 
16860,leo,You're gonna sit with a guy. 
16861,josh,"If this is because of what I just said in there, I wasn't at my best with... "
16862,leo,"Josh, I'm not sure you were fully conscious while you were saying it. "
16863,josh,Yeah. 
16864,josh,I'm not sure it was as bad as maybe it was... 
16865,josh,"Stanley, you can ask the questions and you can answer them, but you can't do both at  the same time. "
16866,josh,Why? 
16867,josh,Is there gonna be a... 
16868,josh,Stanley... 
16869,josh,"Stanley, I got home from the thing, I made a drink, I sat down, I pushed the magazine  aside to use as a coaster, and I missed the coaster. "
16870,josh,I work out when I can. 
16871,josh,And I was so hoping we'd have a second day. 
16872,josh,You diagnosed me in eight hours? 
16873,josh,Yeah. The Congressional Christmas party. 
16874,josh,"The Congressional Christmas party was white-tie, which is unusual, but the President  likes it... "
16875,bartlet,"You look good, Charlie. "
16876,bartlet,I've brought it back.
16877,bartlet,Like Woodrow Wilson and top hats. 
16878,bartlet,No. Thank you.
16879,bartlet,"Charlie, this is how Statesmen dress. This is how they dress in times of occasion. "
16880,bartlet,It's regal. 
16881,c.j.,Hello. I'm sorry to keep you waiting. 
16882,c.j.,"I'm C.J. Cregg, David. We spoke on the phone. "
16883,c.j.,"Mrs. Haussmann, I'm C.J. Cregg. I'm the White House Press Secretary.   Does she understand me? "
16884,c.j.,This is your painting. Your father was Augie Haussmann? 
16885,c.j.,And the Vichy Laws stripped him of his property? 
16886,c.j.,"Well, best as we can tell, the Nazis sold the painting to a Swiss dealer sometime after  your grandfather perished at Auschwitz. It made its way to the Musee d'Orsee, and then to  the National Gallery, where the President spotted it. We've contacted the French... "
16887,c.j.,...who wanted to settle this matter amicably. 
16888,c.j.,"We'd like you to have our sincere apology, as well as, of course, the painting back. "
16889,c.j.,Officers McDaniel and Smith from the Park Police are gonna escort you home. 
16890,c.j.,"You see, you try very hard to be mean, but then you see that being nice is better. "
16891,c.j.,So that moment's over? 
16892,c.j.,"Oh, Josh! Sam said the Didion meeting went well. "
16893,josh,"Yeah, we'll support a LIEHEAP subsidy for air-conditioning in the Texas 23rd. "
16894,c.j.,"Josh, it's Christmas. "
16895,josh,Yeah. 
16896,c.j.,We're starting in five minutes. 
16897,josh,Yeah. 
16898,josh,What was the diagnosis? 
16899,josh,You said you diagnosed me in five minutes. What was the diagnosis? 
16900,josh,"Well, that doesn't really sound like something they let you have if you work for the  President. Can we have it be something else? Seriously, I-I think you might be wrong  about that. I-I'm not tryin' to be difficult. "
16901,josh,"I know that I-I'm givin' you cocky answers, I that should be... "
16902,josh,I know that you want me to talk about my feelings. 
16903,josh,I'm not tryin' to give cocky answers... 
16904,josh,I was fine. 
16905,josh,It was the Bach G Major. 
16906,josh,It is. 
16907,josh,It's Yo-Yo Ma. 
16908,josh,"He's really-he's really quite something, "
16909,josh,I don't know. 
16910,josh,I was just sitting there. 
16911,josh,I don't know! 
16912,josh,I don't know how it started! 
16913,josh,I couldn't make it stop. 
16914,josh,I couldn't make it stop. 
16915,josh,Honestly nothing! 
16916,josh,I sat down on the couch... 
16917,josh, I-I pushed the magazine aside as a coaster... 
16918,josh,I didn't wonder that. 
16919,josh,I didn't wonder that. 
16920,josh,We had nothing in common! 
16921,josh,Who gives a damn if we had the same birthday? 
16922,josh,Stanley... 
16923,josh," Stanley! I made myself a drink, I pushed aside a magazine to use as a coaster. "
16924,josh,Okay then? 
16925,josh,I'm cured? 
16926,josh,Stanley... 
16927,josh,I like you! 
16928,josh,I broke a window! 
16929,josh,And... that'll do the trick? 
16930,josh,I-I'm gettin' short-changed here. 
16931,josh,Hang on! What happens if tomorrow some pilot with my birthday decides to kill himself? 
16932,josh,What started it? 
16933,josh,I was? 
16934,josh,What was it? 
16935,josh,Why would the music have started it? 
16936,josh,...as sirens. 
16937,josh,So that's gonna be my reaction every time I hear music? 
16938,josh,Why not? 
16939,josh,"All the same, I need some more therapy! "
16940,josh,I mean now!  
16941,josh,We can order a pizza! 
16942,josh,"Stanley, I haven't told you my dreams yet! "
16943,josh,Merry Christmas. 
16944,leo,How'd it go? 
16945,josh, Did you wait around for me? 
16946,josh,He thinks I may have an eating disorder. 
16947,leo, Josh. 
16948,josh,"And a fear of rectangles. That's not weird, is it?  I didn't cut my hand on a  glass. I broke a window in my apartment. "
16949,leo,"This guy's walking down a street, when he falls in a hole. The walls are so steep. He  can't get out. A doctor passes by, and the guy shouts up ""Hey you! Can you help me out?""  The doctor writes him a prescription, throws it down the hole and moves on. Then a priest  comes along and the guy shouts up ""Father, I'm down in this hole, can you help me out?""  The priest writes out a prayer, throws it down in the hole and moves on. Then a friend  walks by. ""Hey Joe, it's me, can you help me out?"" And the friend jumps in the hole! Our  guy says ""Are you stupid? Now we're both down here!"" and the friend says, ""Yeah, but I've  been down here before, and I know the way out."" "
16950,josh, The bandage? 
16951,leo,Yeah. 
16952,josh,Yeah. 
16953,leo,Okay. Donna's gonna take you to the emergency room. 
16954,josh,She knows? 
16955,leo,She was the one who guessed. 
16956,josh,I don't need the emergency room. 
16957,leo,"Come on, it could be infected, you could have a thing. "
16958,josh,What thing? 
16959,leo,How the hell do I know? 
16960,josh,Leo...
16962,josh,See you later. 
16963,leo,Okay. 
16964,josh,I don't need a doctor. 
16966,josh,No. 
16969,josh,Yeah. 
16971,josh,Okay. 
16972,josh,"We’re making a fire in a fireplace, what kind of supervision do you want?"
16974,sam,What kind of wood is this?
16975,josh, I don’t know.
16977,josh,It’s freezing in here.
16979,josh,It’s like Ice Station Zebra.
16981,josh,It’s half past midnight!
16982,sam,"See, here’s the thing. This looks like spruce to me."
16983,josh,Yeah?
16984,sam,"And spruce is a softwood, softwood burns out quickly. You know what we need for a slow  burning fire?"
16985,josh,A hardwood?
16986,sam,That’s right.
16987,josh,That’s interesting.
16989,josh,It was sitting in... the thing. 
16991,josh,"It’s wood, we’re not burning Benjamin Harrison’s log cabin."
16992,sam,You know what?
16993,josh,What?
16994,sam,We might be.
16995,josh,Why?
16996,sam,It was made out of spruce.
16997,josh, Where’s C.J.?
16999,josh,Is she doing the seating chart?
17001,josh,"Jancowitz has a hearing aid that seldom works, he needs to be seated near the center.  Would you tell her that?"
17003,josh,"No... no flammable liquids of any kind to start a fire, ever."
17004,sam,Found it!
17005,josh,What?
17006,sam,Kerosene.
17008,josh,Go.
17009,c.j.,"Speaker , House Minority, Senate Majority,  Senate Minority, Whip, Whip, Deputy, Deputy."
17010,c.j.,Yes.
17011,c.j.,What?
17012,c.j.,Yes.
17013,c.j.,Excellent.
17014,c.j.,What about staff aides?
17015,c.j.,So we’re done?
17016,c.j.,Yes.
17018,c.j.,Don’t give me a thing.
17020,c.j.,Why?
17022,c.j.,He can’t sit closer to the center!
17024,c.j.,"Who cares?  It’s a breakfast to trumpet a new spirit of bi-partisanship cooperation  and understanding in a new year, no ones going to be listening to each other anyways!"
17026,c.j.,Because of the thing...
17028,c.j.,"All right, we’re gonna have to move somebody. Would you ask him if it’s better to dis  the House Whip or the Senate Whip?"
17030,josh,You want to stand them in a tripod right?
17031,sam,"Yeah, standing 3 sticks on an end and slanting them to a common center."
17032,josh,Isn’t that a tripod?
17033,sam,"Yeah, but..."
17034,josh,You just thought you’d say more words.
17035,sam,Yeah.
17037,josh,Hang on.  You know what we need?
17038,sam,Dried leaves.
17039,josh,We need dried leaves.
17042,sam,"‘Cause life is tough in the big cruel world, and if he doesn’t like it, he can kiss me!"
17044,sam,Yeah.
17045,josh,Could you possible get us some dried leaves?
17047,sam,You know what?
17048,josh,You think she was being sarcastic?
17049,sam,"Yeah, I don’t think she’s getting the leaves."
17050,josh,You know what we could use?
17051,sam,Newspaper?
17052,josh,"See, this is what I’m talking about, this is teamwork!"
17053,sam,It really is!
17055,c.j.,House?
17057,c.j.,"So, we’ll move the House Whip to the left of Sam and move Jancowitz across from Leo and  we’re all set right?"
17058,c.j.,"Larry, Ed we’re set?  Either one of you?"
17059,c.j.,"Thank you, you see, you guys thought it was going to take a long time and it only ended  up taking 7 and a half hours."
17060,toby, Somebody working on the heat?
17061,c.j.,Seating arrangement is set.
17062,toby,That took some time.
17063,c.j.,It was hard.
17064,toby,You got to find a magic marker.
17065,c.j.,"Toby, when people are sitting with the President, there’s excruciating protocol involved."
17066,toby,Uh-oh.
17067,c.j.,What?!?
17068,toby,Missed one...
17069,c.j.,Who?
17070,toby,Take a look.
17071,c.j.,I’m looking...
17072,toby,It’ll happen.
17073,c.j.,"Okay, guys. You know what we did? We forgot the President."
17074,toby, There it is!
17076,sam,I think this might be because the wood is wet.
17077,josh,"Well, the fire ought to dry it pretty quick shouldn’t it?"
17078,sam,You’d think.
17080,josh,It’s going pretty good now.
17082,toby,What the hell is going on?
17083,josh,The wood’s drying out.
17084,c.j.,Are you burning a dining room table?!
17085,josh,Spruce is a slow drying wood.
17086,toby,Do you have any idea whet you’re talking about?
17087,josh,No.
17088,sam,Hang on. 
17089,c.j.,Are those instructions?
17090,sam,It says this fireplace was a favor to President Andrew Johnson and he would sip whiskey  from a charcoal keg while reading by its light.
17091,josh,That doesn’t help.
17092,sam,The flue’s been welded shut since 1896.
17093,josh,Well that’s probably it then.
17094,josh,"Somebody started a fire in this fireplace, Charlie."
17095,sam,The President’s a thousand yards over and two flights up.
17096,josh,"Well, let’s get a fire extinguisher and put it out before the smoke alar..."
17097,bartlet,What?!
17098,toby,These are the rules.
17099,leo,They're the guidelines.
17100,toby,The meeting will last 90 minutes.
17101,leo,Yes.
17102,toby,And the rules.
17103,leo,The guidelines.
17104,toby,We can't talk about the Patient's Bill of Rights?
17105,leo,We can talk about the Patient's Bill of Rights. We just can't talk about dropping the  provision that would allow for litigation.
17106,toby,Why not?
17107,leo,Because that's not what the breakfast is for.
17108,toby,What's it for?
17109,leo,Symbolize the spirit of cooperation as the new session begins and to eat pancakes.
17110,toby,So with regard to the Patient's Bill of Rights we'll just be debating the things we  agree on?
17111,leo,Yeah.
17112,toby,And raising the minimum wage?
17113,leo,We won't be talking about that at all.
17114,toby,"No, we shouldn't because there's a chance it could lead to something."
17115,sam,We can't talk about the patient's bill of rights?
17116,toby,We can talk about it. We just can't talk about dropping the no litigation clause.
17117,sam,"Leo, what's the point of having rights if you can't sue for them in court?"
17118,leo,That's a fine argument.
17119,toby,We won't be making it.
17120,leo,Not at this breakfast.
17121,sam,And the minimum wage?
17122,leo,Not so much.
17123,josh,I see won't be talking about the 993 tax cut.
17124,leo,We won't be. But we've agreed to call it tax relief instead of a tax cut.
17125,josh,We're calling it tax relief.
17126,leo,Yeah.
17127,josh,But we won't be talking about it.
17128,leo,No.
17129,josh,"Leo, the Patient's Bill of Rights."
17130,leo,Which we'll be referring to as the Comprehensive Access and Responsibility Act.
17131,sam,What's the Comprehensive Access and Responsibility Act?
17132,leo,"It's the Patient's Bill of Rights, but the CARA was introduced in 1999. It's fundamentally  the same thing and the Republicans have agreed to discuss changing the name back."
17133,josh,In exchange for calling tax breaks tax relief.
17134,leo,Or income enhancement.
17135,toby,I'm in a musical.
17136,leo,Getting it renamed for the old bill is a hell of a concession.
17137,toby,"Leo, I'm gonna check in with you for a second, OK?"
17138,leo,Sure.
17139,toby,Sick people...
17140,leo,Yeah.
17141,toby,Not getting proper medical care...
17142,leo,Right.
17143,toby,Because they can't afford it...
17144,leo,Yes.
17145,toby,Probably don't care that we've agreed to change the name of the bill.
17146,leo,We've agreed to discuss changing the name of the bill.
17147,bartlet,What's after that?
17148,bartlet,After that?
17149,bartlet,Who was the idiot who set off the smoke detector?
17150,josh,"Well it sounds a lot like you are talking about Sam, Mr. President."
17151,sam,"What, were you inconvenienced, Sir?"
17152,bartlet,They had me on the Truman balcony for 6 minutes in my underwear.
17153,sam,Was it cold?
17154,bartlet,In January? No. Why do you ask?
17155,toby,Mr. President I'd like to talk about those rules in that memo you’re reading.
17156,leo,"It's a breakfast. Toby, it's a pancake breakfast. There's nothing in that memo that's  important."
17157,bartlet,We're having Vermont maple syrup?
17158,toby,"Mr. President, if you read item 4 you'll see that time at this breakfast will be  spent discussing calling the Patient's Bill of Rights the Comprehensive Access and  Responsibility Act."
17159,bartlet,I don't give a damn if they call it the Monroe doctrine. What the hell are we doing  serving Vermont maple syrup?
17160,toby,"On the minimum wage, if we all turn our attention to item 5 of the Rules of Bipartisan  Breakfast."
17161,leo,They're guidelines. You keep calling them rules.
17162,toby,"Margaret, what does it say at the top of the memo?"
17163,leo, I keep meaning to fire you.
17164,bartlet,New Hampshire syrup is what we serve in this White House.
17165,sam,Sir.
17166,bartlet,It's a breakfast. We eat. We pose for pictures. You do a post-game conference. Everybody  gets the hell out of here and I don't have to be so Officer Crupky.
17167,leo,Anything else?
17168,sam,An ONB efficiency expert has said we could free up much need office space by moving the  Press Room across the street. 
17169,leo,What else?
17170,leo,"Thank you, Mr. President."
17171,bartlet,Thank you. 
17172,leo,Josh.
17173,josh,Yeah.
17174,leo,You feeling all right?
17175,josh,Yeah.
17176,leo,You're sure?
17177,josh,Yeah.
17178,leo,You don't mind me asking?
17179,josh,Nah.
17180,leo,"Because I'm gonna ask you once a day, okay?"
17181,josh,"Okay, but you just asked me four times in the last ten seconds."
17182,leo,I want you to go to Ben and Sally's for dinner tonight.
17183,josh,Are you going?
17184,leo,No.
17185,josh,Was I invited?
17186,leo,No.
17187,josh,Are Ben and Sally asking for me?
17188,leo,"No, they'd rather you didn't come, but they'll do me a favor and I need you to do me one too."
17189,josh,What's at Ben and Sally's?
17190,leo,Karen Cahill.
17191,josh,And what stupid-ass Irish thing did you say to Karen Cahill that you now need me to apologize  at Ben and Sally 's like a little girl?
17192,josh,Let me tell you what was surprising about that moment just then. I said that only 12 hours  after you were very cool about my almost accidentally setting the building on fire.
17193,leo,I made a joke about her shoes.
17194,josh,I'm sorry?
17195,leo,I made a remark about her shoes.
17196,josh,You're the second most powerful man in the country...
17197,leo,And she relates a column for the New York Times and who knows what kind of special  relationship women have with their shoes!
17198,josh,What could you possibly have said...?
17199,leo,It doesn't matter. It was perfectly benign to anyone who doesn't take shoes that seriously.  Just tell her that I love her and that I'm sorry and I'll take her shoe shopping.
17200,josh,Why don't you tell her?
17201,leo,If someone else tells her it seems like I was thoughtful enough to mention it. If I tell her  it just makes me seem feminine.
17202,josh,You don't think the shoe shopping's gonna take care of that?
17203,leo,Let's call the insurance company and see how much water damage was done in the mural room.
17204,josh,"You don't need to wave a stick, Leo. I am totally there for you. "
17205,leo,Thank you.
17206,josh,Can I get Sam to do it?
17207,leo,Fine.
17208,josh,Anything else?
17209,leo,Nope.
17210,c.j., And I'll end the press conference.
17211,c.j.,You're gonna walk him into the cause of bipartisanship?
17212,c.j.,Yes.
17213,c.j.,The meeting was positive.
17214,c.j.,"Friendly, frank, and productive"
17215,c.j.,"Meeting was positive, friendly, frank and productive."
17216,c.j.,If all goes well we should...
17217,c.j.,That's where I brief.
17218,c.j.,And the Majority Leader'll be doing it in front of the actual White House. 
17219,c.j.,"Traditionally, these kinds of things are done in front of the White House."
17220,c.j.,The President's not gonna want to end a bipartisan breakfast with the Republicans speaking  from one place and the Democrats...
17221,c.j.,Which is?
17222,c.j.,My boss and your boss?
17223,c.j.,I don't think they are either.
17224,c.j.,"And, the Majority Leader is gonna brief outside. If the majority leader wants to skip  breakfast there'll be more pancakes for the rest of us. My press room can write about why."
17225,c.j.,You need me?
17226,toby, Can I borrow her for a moment?
17227,c.j.,We'll wait.
17228,toby,These rules are crap.
17229,toby,I could care less who says what in what order. I'm talking about what we say when we sit down.
17230,toby,"Yes, I do."
17231,toby,The president prefers maple syrup from New Hampshire.  I'm not kidding.
17232,toby,Breakfast tomorrow.
17233,toby,I don't give a damn. 
17235,sam,Did you know there's a swimming pool underneath the press Briefing Room?
17237,sam,"There's a swimming pool underneath there. And I'll tell you what else. According to the OMB  efficiency auditor, there are more people working in the West Wing of the White House than  in any point in history."
17239,sam,Yeah.
17241,sam,I realize that there are some flaws in my logic.
17243,sam,What?
17245,sam,I didn't make fun of her shoes.
17247,sam,I don't have any problem with her shoes.
17249,sam,What was his problem with her shoes?
17251,sam,Here's the thing. 
17253,sam,I don't do well with Karen.
17255,sam,I get nervous.
17257,sam,I become unimpressive.
17259,sam,In many ways.
17261,sam,Once.
17263,sam,You think?
17265,sam,"I never have been before, but that's no reason to think I'm not gonna do it."
17267,sam,You know why?
17269,sam,"Perseverance. You get right back on the horse. I'm gonna sit there and she's gonna go home  saying, ""that Sam Seaborn's impressive."" I'm gonna say nice things about her."
17271,sam,I will! 
17273,leo,Yeah.
17274,toby,I'm gonna have breakfast with Ann Stark tomorrow.
17275,leo,Leave it alone.
17276,toby,I think we should be able to discuss the minimum wage and-
17277,leo,Toby. It's a brand new year. 
17278,toby,Let's not faf around!
17279,leo,It's breakfast.
17280,toby,I know. It's breakfast. We're not gonna come up with solutions in 90 minutes. But we have  the principles in a room and no cameras. The- This is what  my ex-wife and I did for years. We had these rules. We could talk about anything but why we  couldn't live with each other. I could've been two years younger right now.
17281,leo,"There was a freshman democrat who came to Congress 50 years ago. He turned to a senior  Democrat and said, ""Where are the Republicans? I want to meet the enemy. The senior Democrat  said, ""The Republicans aren't the enemy. They're the opposition. The Senate is the enemy.""  Those days are over. Toby, in this climate..."
17282,toby,This climate is exactly what real bipartisan debate should look like.
17283,leo,This woman's had this job two weeks. I don't like dealing with people who are trying to  impress me.
17284,toby,I know her a little.
17285,leo,Have breakfast with her.
17286,toby,Thank you.
17287,leo,Toby.
17288,toby,Yeah.
17289,leo,Jenny and I wouldn't talk about it either. You know why?
17290,toby,Why?
17291,leo,Because we loved each other and it was awful and we knew it was never gonna change. Ever.
17292,toby,"Yeah, well..."
17293,toby,What is it?
17294,toby,Really?
17295,toby,Why?
17296,toby,You don’t think it’d be a colossal waste of time?
17297,toby,It’s a bottle of New Hampshire maple syrup.
17298,toby,Ann.
17299,toby,The minimum wage.
17300,toby,For the syrup?
17301,toby,Thank you.
17302,toby,And congratulations.
17303,toby,"You are now the Chief of Staff to the most powerful Republican in the country. Obviously,  a great deal of confidence has been placed into you..."
17304,toby,For being promoted?
17305,toby, Uh... I don’t have one.
17306,toby,"Scrambled eggs, wheat toast and coffee, please."
17307,c.j.,"Carol, did the President say that the stats were even more staggering right here,  in Washington, D.C.?"
17308,c.j.,Would you remind me to clarify that?
17309,c.j.,"He was in Louisville, Kentucky, when he said it."
17310,sam,Hey!
17311,c.j.,Hey.
17312,sam,You got my note?
17313,c.j.,About moving the Press Room to the OEOB...
17314,sam,Yeah.
17315,c.j., I did. 
17316,sam,And?
17317,c.j.,Don’t let anyone ever know that you wrote it and don’t ever mention it again under any  circumstances!
17318,sam,Moving the Press Room?
17319,c.j.,See what you did?
17320,c.j.,You mentioned it.
17321,sam,"Look, if..."
17322,c.j.,You did it again.
17323,sam,"No, I didn’t."
17324,c.j.,You were about to.
17325,sam,"Just to OEOB, just across the street."
17326,c.j.,"We’re not getting a swimming pool, Sam."
17327,sam,"I know we’re not getting a swimming pool, but we can get the much-needed office space.  And we can put a little physical distance between the press and the President. And we can  put them just across the street in a state-of-the-art facility."
17328,c.j.," By ‘state-of-the-art,’ you mean..."
17329,sam,A room with... electricity.
17330,c.j.,"The press doesn’t want physical distance from the President, and the American people would  prefer it the President didn’t have physical distance from the press!"
17331,c.j.,We can’t exile the press!
17332,sam,The room I’m talking about is one hundred yards from where we’re standing!
17333,c.j.,It sends a signal we’re trying to hide things from them.
17334,sam,We are trying to hide things from them. But I don’t think we’re going to be any better at it  if they’re across the street.
17335,c.j., NO!
17336,sam,I’ll get some more information for you.
17337,c.j., I don’t need more information.
17338,sam,So that you can ruminate on it.
17339,c.j.,I don’t need to ruminate!
17340,sam,Excellent! 
17341,sam,Josh!
17343,sam,Hang on a second.
17344,josh, What do you need?
17345,sam,Did the monthly DNC go out yet?
17346,josh,It’s going out now.
17347,sam,Is there time to tack on a question?
17348,josh,"Yeah. Donna, get me the polling center at Global Strategies Group!"
17349,josh,What’s the question?
17350,sam,"C.J. thinks if we move the press out of the West Wing, the American people will object."
17351,josh,She’s crazy.
17352,sam,So I want to show her numbers.
17353,josh,  What should the question be?
17354,sam,"""If the White House would move the Press Corps to Trenton, New Jersey, would you give a  flying...?"""
17355,josh,"Okay.  ""Would you object to the White House moving the Press Room out of the  West Wing and into a facility across the street?"" Read it back."
17357,sam,It went great.  I had to talk to Karen Cahill last night.
17359,sam,"I did not. In fact, we were talking about the stability of former Soviet Republics and their  fear of Islamic extremism and I have to say that I made some very scholarly points regarding  the remains of nuclear weapons in Kyrgyzstan, and I have to believe..."
17360,josh, Kazakhstan.
17361,sam, Hmmm?
17362,josh,The nuclear weapons are in Kazakhstan.
17363,sam,I said Kyrgyzstan?
17364,josh,Yeah.
17365,sam,"Yeah, well, Kyrgyzstan has no nuclear weapons."
17366,josh,No.
17367,sam,Kazakhstan is a country four times the size of Texas and has a sizable number of former  Russian missile silos.
17368,josh,Yeah.
17369,sam,Kyrgyzstan is on the side of a hill near China and has mostly nomads and sheep.
17371,sam,Yes. I’m sure. Okay. 
17372,toby,And why not talk about the minimum wage?
17373,toby,"Ann, do you know what a full-time worker, employed at five dollars and fifteen cents an hour,  makes in a year?"
17374,toby,Which is 26 hundred dollars below the poverty line. Why have a minimum wage?
17375,toby,"Ann, I was just..."
17376,toby,"I’m saying it could at least keep up with inflation! In the last thirty years, the purchasing  power of the minimum wage has gone down 30%, while you know how much the stock market has  gone up?"
17377,toby,"Fine, so let’s talk about it at breakfast!"
17378,toby,Why?
17379,toby,"No, they will call and say, ‘What the hell are you doing, rolling the ball at all?’ You’re  gonna sandbag the thing in committee. You’ve shown us your whole hand. You’re playing a game  and not that well."
17380,toby,Your predecessor didn’t play it well.
17381,toby,"Ann, we’re not going to get screwed around on the wage hike."
17382,toby,We have the votes and you know it.
17383,toby,"There is going to be a vote, straight up or down, and if there isn’t, we’ll offer the wage  hike as an amendment on everything that moves!"
17384,toby,You heard me the first time.
17385,toby, Ann...
17386,toby,We can talk about it?
17387,toby,In exchange for what?
17388,toby,In exchange for what?
17389,toby,In. Exchange. For what?
17390,toby,That’s all?
17391,toby,You want the press conference at the Hill?
17392,toby,Done.
17393,toby,C.J. works for me.
17394,toby,You’re welcome. 
17395,bartlet,Charlie!
17396,bartlet,Who’s the next meeting?
17397,bartlet,"I don’t need a cheat sheet.  Kim Woo, he won a bronze medial for  fencing, he’s a Buddhist, and he enjoys European History. You see Charles’s even thought  it’s a handshake, I’m able to make him feel like a friend and that’s a little thing they  call ‘people skills.’"
17398,bartlet,"The man’s an Olympic athlete, Charlie. I wouldn’t say that to his face."
17399,bartlet,What else?
17400,bartlet,"on glasses, reads] Ladies and Gentleman.  She’s a woman?"
17401,bartlet,Did you mark that down? 
17402,bartlet, Did you know it’s bad luck to toast with water?
17403,bartlet,"Yeah, you don’t want to make a toast with water."
17404,bartlet,"From Greek mythology, I’m almost sure. You lose your spirit. "
17405,bartlet, Hmm?
17406,bartlet,"That’s a great question, Charlie, and I could tell you, but I think it’s better if you look  it up on your own."
17407,bartlet, Remind me to tell Sam that’s good.
17408,bartlet,And remind me not to make a toast with water.
17409,bartlet,Ah. Let’s go...
17410,sam,I said the wrong one. 
17412,sam,I'm fairly certain. 
17414,sam,It was Karen Cahill. There was a 99 of a 100 chance of saying the right one. I said the  wrong one. 
17416,sam, She's a very influential woman. 
17418,sam,"She's a columnist, she gets the last word. "
17420,sam,She has some kind of special powers. 
17422,sam,Yeah. 
17424,sam,I got it wrong. 
17426,sam,There are barely pots and pans in Kyrgizstan. 
17428,sam,I do. 
17430,sam,Yeah.  Here's what we're gonna do. 
17432,sam,You're gonna talk to her. 
17434,sam,You've met. 
17436,sam,And you said you felt the two of you made a connection. 
17438,sam,Here's what you're gonna do. 
17440,sam,Yes. 
17442,sam,That's great. You're going to the Southstreet Exhibit tonight. 
17444,sam,You told me. She's going too. 
17446,sam,She told me. 
17448,sam,"Yes. Here's what you're gonna do. You're gonna go up to her 'Hi I'm Donna Moss, I don't  know if you remember me, I'm Josh Lyman's assistant.' You just had to come up to her cause  you knew she'd get a kick out of this. Sam Seaborn's being so cute, he was talking to you  and he thinks he may have said Kyrgizstan when he obviously meant Kazakhstan. "
17450,sam,It 'd kill you? 
17452,sam,Thank you. 
17453,c.j.,Yeah? 
17454,toby,Yeah. I just had breakfast with Ann Stark. 
17455,c.j.,Minimum wage? 
17456,toby,No. 
17457,c.j.,It's for the best.  
17458,toby,Why? 
17459,c.j.,Cause they'll be a fight. 
17460,toby,Yes. 
17461,c.j.,Toby...
17462,toby,There should be a fight. We disagree on something important and immediate. 
17463,c.j.,Which means there should be a compromise.
17464,toby,Which isn't going to happen by posing for a picture. 
17465,c.j.,"It isn't gonna happen eating pancakes either, Toby, so let 'em tell dirty jokes for  90 minutes, shake hands, and start the year. "
17466,toby,Not when it's the taxpayers’ pancakes. 
17467,c.j.,The taxpayers will be happy to know that the Democrats are trying to tighten heir belts  where they can. 
17468,toby,They're willing to put a provision of the patients’ bill up for discussion. 
17469,c.j.,"Well, that's a little something you can all disagree on. "
17470,toby,Fifteen minutes. 
17471,c.j.,You can do a lot of disagreeing in fifteen minutes. 
17472,toby,In exchange she wants the press conference on the hill. 
17473,c.j.,Now she wants the whole thing on the hill?! 
17474,toby,"Yeah, listen- "
17475,c.j.,I said ‘no’ yesterday to the split conference what makes her think...
17476,toby,Because I'm asking you to. 
17477,c.j.,What!? 
17478,toby,That's what they get in exchange. 
17479,c.j.,Are you kidding me?! 
17480,toby,Look...
17481,c.j.,"Toby, are you kidding me?! "
17482,toby,Who cares whether...?
17483,c.j.,"First of all, I don't even know where to start..."
17484,c.j.,"But first of all, if they say anything that needs a response I need twenty minutes with  staff. I can't stand around there and huddle in front of the White House and Congressional  Press Corps. "
17485,toby,"There's not gonna be a surprise, you've already decided what you're gonna say, which is not  much of anything at all! "
17486,c.j.," We don't speak for the President on the steps of the capital,  we don't need to be offered their microphone it makes us look like less than what we are,  in fact, it makes us look small!"
17487,toby,"We're calling tax breaks tax reliefs, refusing to discuss raising the salary of those living  in poverty, arguing the seating arrangement and you think that's going to make us look small? "
17488,c.j.,Toby. 
17489,toby,We're talking about the no litigation clause for fifteen minutes. I don't care if the damn  press conference is outside the rotary club. 
17490,c.j.,It shouldn't be me then. 
17491,toby,Fine. 
17492,c.j.,It should be the deputy. 
17493,toby,I'll tell Ann it's not going to be you. 
17494,c.j.,"I think this is a bad idea. I think the first visual we get is that Congress is the seat of  power and the President is irrelevant. Not only that, but you just took my legs out from  under me with Ann! Are you ordering me to move it to the hill? "
17495,toby,I don't like doing that. 
17496,c.j.,You're gonna have to. 
17497,toby, Do it. 
17498,c.j.,It's about to start.
17499,c.j.,"Hey Steve, you should be up on the hill. "
17500,c.j.,No. 
17501,c.j.,From who? 
17502,c.j.,It's starting. 
17503,c.j.,Why? 
17504,c.j.,She got called by a pollster. 
17505,c.j.,She herself got called. 
17506,c.j.,Let me get into it. 
17507,c.j.,When did he get a sore throat? 
17508,c.j.,She took the Majority Leader off the board. 
17509,c.j.,She took him off the board. 
17510,c.j.,"Was it a balance thing? No, she didn't want balance she wanted power. "
17511,c.j.,Why would she take her boss off the board? 
17512,c.j.,We're about to get hit.
17513,toby,I'm the Senior Aide.
17514,c.j.,No kidding.  Get me Henry. 
17515,c.j.,I've got Henry. What do you want? 
17516,c.j.,"What do you want me to do, Toby?"
17517,toby, Don't let him take the podium. You'll take questions in the briefing room in  20 minutes.
17518,c.j.,"Henry, get home."
17519,leo,"Hey, what the hell happened?"
17520,toby,That was me.  I gave Ann Stark the quote and she fed it to a reporter.
17521,leo,Why’d you give her the quote?
17522,toby,It wasn’t a quote when I gave it to her.
17523,leo,What the hell was it?
17524,toby,I was letting her know we have the votes...
17525,leo,She knows we have the votes.
17526,toby,I wasn’t...
17527,leo,She was just promoted to Chief of Staff of the Senate Majority Leader. You don’t think she  knows we have the votes?
17528,toby, I misunderstood my relationship with Ann Stark.
17529,leo,"Yes, you did. And now it looks like we went to the press and went for his knees."
17530,sam,Excuse me but Toby’s not the one who gave it to the press!
17531,leo,You think the Majority Leader’s going to believe that? 
17532,toby,No.
17533,leo,It was a breakfast. It was a damn photo opportunity. The year is one week old. The legislative  session hasn’t begun and we can’t put a forkful of waffles in our mouth without coughing up  the ball. You got beat.
17534,toby,Yes.
17535,c.j.,I have press in ten minutes...
17536,leo,Figure it out. Tell me what you’re going to do.
17537,josh,We can take the high road and say we don’t want it to disintegrate into a war of words.
17538,sam,We don’t want to disrupt the fragile peace...
17539,c.j.,The fragile peace has been disrupted. We’ve been accused of ambushing the Majority Leader  in the press.
17540,josh,Also Labour’s going to want to know if we stand by the minimum wage.
17541,sam,"Why don’t we pass it off to Labour? Have the Labour Secretary make a statement ""We support  the two dollar minimum wage."""
17542,josh,"Yeah, let’s emphasize the close we are on this."
17543,sam,"""We support the minimum wage hike over two years. The Republicans want it over three years.  We’re close to an agreement..."""
17544,c.j.,"Sounds like we’re close to agreeing on 30 months which we’re not, and no one’s going to  want to cover a statement from the Labour Secretary which is good, ‘cause if they did it’d  look like we’re ducking."
17545,sam,"No, I don’t think..."
17546,toby,"She’s right. We can’t be passive and the high road doesn’t go where we need it to.  Be cool, be funny, smack them down hard."
17547,sam,The Majority Leader is tragically out of touch with the needs of real people.
17548,josh,And why wasn’t he at the podium? A sore throat? We know how tough that can be. Thank goodness  he had health insurance.
17549,sam,There it is!
17550,c.j.,That’s the sound bite.
17551,josh,And that’s the new story.
17552,c.j.,Toby?
17553,toby,Do it.
17554,c.j.,"Carol, I need voting stats on health care. "
17555,josh,"How’s this for a phrase ""You can lay down in front of the train or you can get on board?"""
17556,sam,That’s a really bad phrase.
17557,josh,"Is it better if it’s ""You can get on board the train or you can lay down in front of it?"""
17558,sam,No it’s really bad either way.
17560,josh,What is it?
17562,josh,Give me that.
17563,sam,How’d it go?
17565,sam,Did you talk to her?
17567,sam,Did you say it was cute the way I worried about it?
17569,sam,Did it turn out I got it wrong?
17571,sam,Okay...
17574,josh,Your underwear.
17576,josh,"I’m holding... your underwear... in my hand... right now. And the way I know it’s your  underwear is that your name sewn in the back, which is obviously something we’ll spend  some time talking about at a later date."
17578,sam,"Donna, did you by any chance where the same pair of pants two days in a row this week?"
17580,josh,Donna?
17582,josh,"Okay, when you get dressed on day two did you check the pant leg for the previous day’s  underwear?"
17584,josh,Donna.
17586,josh,It would appear that way.
17588,josh,The South Street exhibit.
17590,josh,On the floor in front of Karen Cahill.
17592,josh,She sent a note.
17593,c.j.," Fred and Ethel, would you follow me please?"
17594,josh,She’s talking about us.
17595,c.j.,Did a question get tacked on to the monthly DNC tracking poll about moving the press room?
17596,sam,"Yes, it did. Because I at least wanted to shoot down the argument that the public..."
17597,c.j.,"The public gets their news from the press, and the press gets their news..."
17598,sam,It’s a private poll. The press doesn’t have access to it.
17599,c.j.,So they don’t know what questions we’re asking?
17600,sam,Yeah.
17601,c.j.,Are you sure?
17602,sam,The only way they’d know what questions were being asked is if they were actually called  by one of the pollsters and... Oh my god! 
17603,c.j.,Yes.
17604,sam,A reporter got called by one of the pollsters?
17605,c.j.,"Yes, indeed."
17606,josh,Wow. What are the chances of that?
17607,sam,The chances of that are astronomical.
17608,c.j.,Guys...
17609,josh,We can calculate it. They sample 800 respondents...
17610,c.j.,Would the two of you stop being amazed by the mathematics!
17611,sam,"All right, I’d pass it off. Just say some poor schnook in the management office got the  idea and wanted to kick it around."
17612,c.j.,Sam.
17613,sam,"It’s going to be me, right?"
17614,c.j.,Yeah.
17615,sam,Ok.
17616,josh,You ready?
17617,c.j.,Yeah.
17618,josh,You had a lot of opportunities today to say ‘I told you so’ and score some points with Leo.  You’re a class act.
17619,c.j.,Why were you holding women’s underwear before?
17620,josh,Never really needed a reason. Eat ‘em up.
17621,toby,"And shocked. Shocked, I say, to discover that there is gambling going on in this establishment."
17622,toby,You think this is funny?
17623,toby,Ann...
17624,toby,My party’s in the White House.
17625,toby,You think I’m going to sit around while you reduce the President to Prime Minister?
17626,toby,You think this could wait until an election year?
17627,toby,"Because ten years ago we used to be able to sit down, we’d order a couple of bourbons,  we’d talk about health care, we’d talk about the minimum wage.  He didn’t  have a sore throat."
17628,toby,You kept him off the board so he could come back on and fix it.
17629,toby,When are you going to announce?
17630,toby,That he’s running for President.
17631,c.j.,Good morning. I’m going to read a short statement in response to the rather bizarre take  on what was otherwise an unremarkable...
17632,bartlet,I think the whole damn thing is bizarre.
17633,bartlet,The right moment for what?
17634,bartlet,"Well, I’m not sure there is a right moment for you to ask me that, Charlie."
17635,bartlet,Yeah.
17636,leo," Good evening, Mr. President"
17637,bartlet,Donna wants me to call Karen Cahill and make it clear she wasn’t hitting on her when she gave  her her underwear.
17638,leo,"Yeah, that’s ‘cause I made fun of her shoes and Sam said there were nuclear weapons in  Kyrgyzstan and Donna went to clear up the mix up and accidentally left her underwear."
17639,bartlet,There can’t possibly be nuclear weapons in Kyrgyzstan.
17640,leo,"Mr. President, please don’t wade hip deep into this story."
17641,bartlet,Okay. Yeah.
17642,bartlet," I’m going to bed. If anybody thinks of new ways for us to make friends  don’t hesitate to wake me. Or, you know, just feel free to start a fire."
17643,leo,"Thank you, Mr. President."
17644,bartlet,Good night.
17645,toby,He didn’t want to see me.
17646,leo,He’ll be all right in the morning.
17647,toby,Yeah.
17648,leo,You’re the Communications Director. It was a TV show.
17649,toby,It was a blunder from top to bottom. You should know it could have been avoided at several  points along the way if I’d listened to C.J.
17650,leo,Or me.
17651,toby,Yeah.
17652,leo,Alexander Hamilton didn’t think we should have political parties. Neither did John Adams.  He thought political parties led to divisiveness.
17653,toby,They do. They should. We have honest disagreements. Arguments are good.
17654,leo,Only if they lead to statesmanship. Or it’s just theatre. And statesmanship is compromise.
17655,toby,"What about persuasion? They’re coming for us, Leo."
17656,leo,I know.
17657,toby,I mean they’re coming for us now.
17658,leo,"Toby, if you knew what it was like getting him to run the first time..."
17659,toby,I know.
17660,leo,Like pushing molasses up a sandy hill. If I go and tell him it’s time to run again he’s  going to get crazy... and frustrated. He’s going to sink into his head and he’s going to  say he’s not running.
17661,toby,Yeah.
17662,leo,Yeah.
17663,toby,"So we’ve got to do it for him. We’ll keep it away from this office but we’ve got to get real  now. Leo, Ann Stark’s a war time consigliere. That’s why she was bumped up."
17664,leo,"I’m a wartime consigliere too, Toby. I was just hoping it’d be peace time a little longer."
17665,toby,Yeah.
17666,leo,Son of a bitch!
17667,toby,Yeah.
17668,leo,Shake my hand.
17669,leo,We just formed it.
17670,toby,Formed what?
17671,leo,The Committee to Reelect the President.
17672,leo,Are we patched into the Pentagon? 
17673,leo,We can hear them? 
17674,leo,We can hear what they're saying at command? 
17675,leo,Why can't I hear anything? 
17676,leo,"Guys, why aren't we hearing anything? "
17677,leo,"Okay, why don't you just tell me to shut up? "
17678,leo,Here we go. 
17679,leo,How long do we have? 
17680,bartlet,"Mr. Sumatra, I understand you're a sports fan. "
17681,bartlet,"Okay. Well, golf's not a sport. It's fine. Don't get me wrong but let's not you and  I confuse it with things that men do. "
17682,bartlet,"You know, we're going to Bangkok in June, I think.  June, Charlie? "
17683,bartlet,"Best hotel in the world, right?"
17684,bartlet,Is that right? 
17685,bartlet, Make sure I see that. 
17686,bartlet, Tom? 
17687,bartlet,"Mr. Sumatra, I accept your letter of credence from King Adulyadej and by affixing my  signature and seal,  do hereby declare you to be an ambassador  extraordinary and plenipotentiary. "
17688,bartlet,May our people know peace and prosperity.  Congratulations. 
17689,bartlet,We've got some gifts here and we're going to stand for pictures. 
17690,bartlet," Madam, congratulations. "
17691,leo," Hey, Charlie, is he done? "
17692,leo,I'd like him in the situation room. Can I pull him? 
17693,leo,"It's not an emergency, just time sensitive. "
17694,leo, What are you looking at? 
17695,leo,It's not preposterous. It's not a contraption and mind your own business. 
17696,leo,"Well, in your day, you could pretty much turn back the Indians with a Daniel Boone  musket, couldn't you?"
17697,leo,"Sharpen a pencil, would ya? "
17698,bartlet, What's up? 
17699,leo,The target's in the air. They're going to launch the intercept any moment. 
17700,bartlet,And I'm sure somebody will come along soon thereafter and tell it didn't work. 
17701,leo,Why do you gotta take that attitude? 
17702,bartlet,Cause it's not going to work. 
17703,leo,What do I get if it works? 
17704,bartlet,What do you get? 
17705,leo,Yes. 
17706,bartlet,"Well, I can't make you Thailand's ambassador to the United States because I just signed  that guy's letter.  "
17707,leo,Come with me to the situation room.
17708,bartlet,You know what you are? You are the Charlie Brown of missile defense. The Pentagon is Lucy. 
17709,leo,I'm not familiar with the reference. 
17710,bartlet,Peanuts. Charlie Brown. 
17711,leo,I've heard of them. I'm just not conversant in them. 
17712,bartlet,Why? 
17713,leo,I've never read the comics. 
17714,bartlet,"Leo, were you born at the age of 55? "
17715,leo,I know there's a dog. 
17716,bartlet,"Charlie Brown wanted to kick a football and Lucy would hold it, except she'd pull it  away at the last minute and Charlie Brown would fall on his butt."
17717,leo,That's funny?
17718,bartlet,"No, but each time Lucy would find a way to convince Charlie Brown that this time she  wouldn't pull the ball away. But she would and, once again, Charlie Brown would fall  on his butt."
17719,leo,And that's funny?
17720,bartlet,Its' satirical.
17721,leo,What's it satirizing? 
17722,bartlet,The DOD bringing you to the Situation Room every time they run a new missile test so  that you come tell me how great it works so I'll put money in the NMD system. 
17723,leo,You should put money in the NMD system. 
17724,bartlet,It doesn't work. 
17725,leo,It will work. One day soon.
17726,leo,There're a couple of three star generals in there. Call 'em Lucy and you're on your own. 
17727,bartlet,"Hey, where are we? "
17728,leo,What's the time to the target. 
17729,bartlet,And it's going to hit my garage in New Hampshire when?
17730,bartlet,So what happens now? 
17731,leo,"In 20 seconds, it collides with the nuclear warhead. "
17732,bartlet,Where? 
17733,leo,Outer space.
17734,bartlet,"Okay, but we don't have anybody out there right now do we? "
17735,leo,Sir...
17736,bartlet,"When we stay at the Oriental in Bangkok, we have to check out James Michener's typewriter."
17737,bartlet,Is that silence usually a pretty good sign? 
17738,leo,No. 
17739,bartlet,It was just enthusiastic. 
17740,leo,By how much? 
17741,leo, By how much did it miss the target?
17742,leo,We missed the target by 137 feet? 
17743,leo, We missed it by 137 miles?! 
17744,bartlet,"When you consider the size of outer space, Leo, that's not so bad. "
17745,bartlet,"By the way, the words you're looking for are ""Oh good grief."" "
17746,c.j.,"For those of you who haven't seen it, it's a very lovely ceremony. It's relatively  informal, the ambassadors are led into the Oval Office, probably with a few friends  and family. They chat for a few moments with President, maybe exchange some gifts,  and they're officially presented by the State Department's Chief of Protocol, who  asks the President to accept the ambassador's credentials and the President signs  a letter to that effect.  Yes? "
17747,c.j.,"There is! It's the order in which they arrived in Washington. This morning the President  saw Ambassador Sumatra of Thailand, then will be Peter Hans of Sweden, followed by her  Excellency Renee Ernesto of Argentina, Noah Jolla of Burkina Faso and the newly named  British Ambassador to the United States will be arriving in the United States just as  soon as he's been newly named. "
17748,c.j.,Anthony Brass. 
17749,c.j.,"Anthony Brass cited family obligations at home, and withdrew over the weekend. "
17750,c.j.,"Sir Christopher Nealingroach, yes. Sir Christopher has been diagnosed with a rare form  of encephalitis, contracted during his recent posting to Kenya. "
17751,c.j.,"I don't know. As soon as the State Department tells me, I'll know. In the meantime, it's  pool photographs only until tomorrow night when there'll be a cocktail reception for the  new ambassadors. That's all.  Does anybody wanna know who's  been here the longest? The Dean of the Diplomatic Corps...anybody? Guys, you know I  study these things just for you! It's Prince Vandaar Ben Sultan of Saudi Arabia. "
17752,c.j.,I could have also told them that Burkina Faso has a population of eleven million and  in even years they host Africa's largest crops market. 
17753,c.j.,I need a chance to use that knowledge. 
17754,sam, C.J.! 
17755,c.j.,You know the chief crops of Burkina Faso? 
17756,sam,No. 
17757,c.j.,"Millet, sorghum, rice, peanuts and cotton. "
17758,sam, You should mention in your afternoon briefing that we've accepted a last minute  invitation for the President to address the Global Defense Council tomorrow night at  the Sheraton. 
17759,c.j.,I thought we passed on the GDC. 
17760,sam,"Well we passed on it three months ago when we thought the President was going to be in  South America. But the trip got canceled and they lost their keynote speaker, so we're  gonna use this to launch CARE, and that's what I want you to announce at the afternoon  briefing. "
17761,sam,Yeah. 
17762,c.j.,Okay... 
17763,sam,Clean Air Rehabilitation Effort. 
17764,c.j.,Yeah. 
17765,sam,You don't know what it is. 
17766,c.j.,The Clean Air Rehabilitation Effort. It's an effort by which we clean the air and  rehabilitate it. 
17767,sam,"Okay, how could you... "
17768,c.j.,I'm not involved in the nuances of environmental policy! 
17769,sam,Which will come as a relief to environmentalists. 
17770,c.j.,Sam! 
17771,sam,I'll brief you later. 
17772,c.j.,I knew the crops of Burkina Faso! 
17773,sam,I'll brief you later. 
17774,sam,Have we heard from Toby?
17775,sam,Do we know if he's landed? 
17776,sam,How is everyone doing in here? 
17777,sam,"Is global warming a real environmental condition, or merely a temporary anomaly? Is it  a global threat, or the exaggerated claim of alarmists? The time for such debate is over.  As of today, it shall be the unequivocal position of the United States government that  global warming constitutes a clear and present danger to the health and future well-being  of this planet and all its inhabitants. Did somebody get that? "
17778,sam,I didn't see anyone writing. 
17779,sam,I just added a thing! 
17780,sam,"I just added ""the time for such debate is over."" "
17781,sam,It sets up the whole reveal. 
17782,sam,Okay. 22 trillion in benefits versus one half a trillion in compliance costs we're  making sure that's right? 
17783,sam,We're making sure in a couple places? 
17784,sam,I wanna cite three different sources. 
17785,sam,And we don't know if Toby's back? 
17786,sam,Is it Toby? 
17787,sam,Can I have the phone? 
17788,sam,"Thanks. 22,000 fewer respiratory related hospital admissions? I don't wanna use the  stats unless I have three sources.  How was your trip? "
17789,toby,It was fine.  What's goin' on? 
17790,sam,The President's gonna speak at the GDC conference tomorrow night. 
17791,toby,I'm sorry? 
17792,sam,He's gonna launch the... 
17793,toby,What are you talking about? 
17794,sam,He's gonna launch CARE. 
17795,toby,Since when? 
17796,sam,Their keynote speaker fell through. 
17797,toby,When was this decision made? 
17798,sam,Last night. 
17799,toby,Why wasn't I involved? 
17800,sam,You were in Kansas City. 
17801,toby,I have a telephone. 
17802,sam,Toby! 
17803,toby,"I have a damn telephone, Sam! "
17804,sam,"Frankly, I didn't think... I thought there'd be a consensus. "
17805,toby,Who was at this meeting?
17806,sam,Where?
17807,toby,Where the decision was made.
17808,sam,"It was me, Carl Todd of the EPA, James Siskin was there... Toby we've been looking for  an opportunity to launch... "
17809,toby,Leo wasn't there? 
17810,sam,"No... been looking for a platform for this, the opportunity... "
17811,toby,Let me understand... 
17812,sam,...presented itself. What's the problem?
17813,toby,"There are a number of problems, anyone of which I could have told you about, had you  gotten me on the phone! Well, one thing, we already blew off the AFL CIO, cause we told  them the President was gonna be in South America. "
17814,sam,"The President was gonna be in South America, now he's not. "
17815,toby,"Instead, he's speaking for labor's good friend, the environmental lobby! "
17816,sam,No... 
17817,toby,"Also, he's the President of the United States, he's nobody's understudy! You've got  him goin' out there like... Joey Bishop! "
17818,sam,"I gotta say, I hear all that, but the President, he's very enthusiastic. "
17819,toby,Of course he's enthusiastic. 
17820,sam,"I'm sayin', I wasn't in there twisting his arm! I told him this opportunity had opened  up, that we had enough notes so that I could finish the speech in time. He asked us a  few questions, we answered them and he said yes! "
17821,toby,Alright... I don't... alright. 
17822,sam,It's gonna be a good speech! 
17823,toby,Yeah.
17824,sam,Thanks.  
17825,toby,Fine. I need to see Leo. 
17826,c.j.,It's not gonna be Sir Christopher Nealingroach. 
17827,josh, I heard! 
17828,c.j.,I said it's not gonna be Sir Christopher Nealingroach. 
17829,josh,And I said I heard! 
17830,c.j.,But I like to say Sir Christopher Nealingroach. 
17831,josh,Who's it gonna be? 
17832,c.j.,I'm waiting to hear from someone at the State Department. 
17833,josh,Me too. 
17834,c.j.,Maybe it'll be Sir Christopher Nealingroach. 
17835,josh,Can I stop talking to you now? 
17836,c.j.,What are you doing? 
17837,josh,I'm standing with my back straight against the wall. 
17838,c.j.,Why? 
17839,josh,I was told by the doctors it would relax me. 
17841,c.j.,Gotta go!  
17842,josh,Yeah. 
17844,josh,Yeah. What?
17846,josh,Why? 
17848,josh,What's a reporter doing talking to you? 
17850,josh,Leo McGarry has nothing but respect and affection for John Marbury. 
17852,josh,"Good, 'cause Leo thinks he's a lunatic. "
17854,josh,"That may be so, but Leo thinks he's a lunatic. "
17856,josh,No. 
17858,josh,How do you know he's brilliant? 
17860,josh,"I'm not threatened by his brilliance, nor am I threatened by his good looks. "
17862,josh,I'm not threatened at all... 
17864,josh,"Neither Leo or I are threatened by his brains, his looks or his charm. He is, however,  a lunatic Brit and we're grateful there's an ocean between us. "
17866,josh,There isn't what? 
17868,josh,"Please, don't tell me... "
17871,josh,"I'm just gonna, you know, stand next to the wall for a while longer. "
17873,toby,Josh. 
17874,josh,"Okay, what I need people to do is knock. "
17875,toby,I did knock. 
17876,josh,But you didn't wait for a response. 
17877,toby,Why would I? 
17878,josh,"'Cause, I could have been relaxing by standing behind that door. "
17879,toby, All right. 
17880,josh,How was your trip? 
17881,toby,It was fine. So we're pinch hitting at the GDC conference. 
17882,josh,"For the record, I didn't think it was a good idea and I said so. "
17883,toby,"And it seems to have helped. Look, we can't appear to be at the beckon call of the  environment! "
17884,josh,We could try insulting them. 
17885,toby,Yes. 
17886,josh,I'm kidding. 
17887,toby,I'm not! 
17888,josh,We were invited.
17889,toby,Don't care.
17890,josh,What do you have? 
17891,toby,"Environmental terrorists burned down a ski resort, and the GDC didn't comment. "
17892,josh,Why did environmental terrorists burn down a ski resort? 
17893,toby,To save the lynx. 
17894,josh,The links? 
17895,toby,Yeah. 
17896,josh,Environmental terrorists burned down a ski resort to save a golf course? 
17897,toby,It's an animal. 
17898,josh,Sam's going to have strong objections. 
17899,toby,"Yes, I know. "
17900,josh,"All right, you want me to talk to Leo? "
17901,toby,I'm going to talk to him. I want you to talk to C.J.. 
17902,josh,About what? 
17903,toby,The Will Roger's dinner is going to ask Cornelius Sykes to host. 
17904,josh, You're kidding me! 
17905,toby,Nope. 
17906,josh,He didn't laugh at the joke. 
17907,toby,Talk to C.J. 
17908,josh,Yeah.  
17909,toby,Why do you relax by standing behind the door? 
17910,josh," I'm not standing behind the door, I'm standing with my back straight  against the wall, so that if... "
17911,toby,I don't care.  
17912,josh,'kay. 
17913,leo,"Keith. Keith, I can't tell him that. I can't tell the President that nine out of ten  things went right, he's going to say, ""Yeah, but we didn't hit anything!"" Would you  please? Thank you.  We had an NMD test this morning.  We were successful in nine out of ten criteria. "
17914,toby,We missed. 
17915,leo,Yeah. 
17916,toby,By how much? 
17917,leo,"We were trying to shoot down an incoming intercontinental ballistic missile; once you  miss, it really doesn't matter by how much. "
17918,toby,I suppose. 
17919,leo,A hundred and thirty-seven miles. 
17920,toby, Sam just told me about his speech. 
17921,leo,Which speech? 
17922,toby,The GDC. 
17923,leo,Yeah. 
17924,toby,Leo. 
17925,leo, I wasn't in the meeting. 
17926,toby,How did that... 
17927,leo,I wasn't in the meeting! It happened fast. 
17928,toby,I'm saying how'd it... 
17929,leo,"It happened fast. Sam pitched it, and the President wanted to do it. "
17930,toby,"Leo, how could you not be in that meeting? "
17931,leo,'Cause I'm trying to get the President to warm up to a missile shield that's supposed  to save humanity and there's a limit to the number of rooms I can be in at once! You  want to file a complaint? 
17932,toby,No. 
17933,leo,Good. 
17934,toby,Here's what I think... 
17935,leo,Screw the environmental lobby? 
17936,toby," Did I say that? Did I say, 'screw the environmental lobby?' "
17937,leo,You didn't say anything. 
17938,toby,"That's right, and before I even open my mouth, you decide I'm going to say 'screw the  environmental lobby?' "
17939,leo,I apologize. 
17940,toby,There's an extent to which we've gotta screw the environmental lobby. 
17941,leo,Yep. 
17942,toby,A clear and public demonstration that the President's not beholden to them isn't a bad  idea right now. 
17943,leo,You think he should walk into their ballroom and smack them around? 
17944,toby,"I really do, for 30 seconds out of a 40 minute address announcing the initiative  they love. "
17945,leo,How do you think they're gonna feel about the 30 seconds? 
17946,toby,"Not that good, but that's the point. We don't have to move to our right if there's an  opportunity to spank the people to our left. "
17947,leo,Anything in particular we want to spank them for? 
17948,toby,Failing to publicly admonish acts of eco-terrorism. 
17949,leo,The GDC doesn't engage in acts of eco-terrorism. 
17950,toby,"Yes, but they fail to publicly admonish those who do. "
17951,leo,For example? 
17952,toby,A 12 million dollar Colorado ski development that was under construction was set on  fire because it threatened the habitat of a rare local lynx. 
17953,leo,Is a lynx a...? 
17954,toby,"I don't know. I... I think... I think it's like a possum or something, and it doesn't  matter... "
17955,leo,"All right, tell Sam to find a place to out it. "
17956,toby,I don't want it in the advanced text. I don't want Sam and his fourteen objections.  It should just be a drop-in. 
17957,leo,I'll talk to the President. Anything else? 
17958,toby,137 miles. 
17959,leo,Yeah. 
17960,toby,Is that a lot? 
17961,leo,Yeah. 
17962,toby,Okay.  
17963,sam,"We have 30 minutes at the ballroom after the speech to spin and obviously, the next  morning as well. Among the things you want to be emphasizing are what? "
17964,sam,"We have 4% of the population. We are responsible for 25% of the Greenhouse emission.   How are we going to reduce those levels of Greenhouse emissions, you ask? "
17965,c.j.,Through the Clean Air Rehabilitation Effort. 
17966,sam,"Yes, which you can read about in bullet points, beginning on page 11. Please don't skip  the footnotes, and please, don't just read what's underlined. "
17967,c.j.,Question. 
17968,sam, Yes. 
17969,c.j.,Were you able to get girls to go out with you in High School? 
17970,sam,Yes. 
17971,c.j.,Really? 
17972,sam," Under these regulations there will be a cap on the volume  of carbon dioxide a company could emit in a year, but what's the good news? "
17973,sam,Creating what? 
17974,sam,"A cash incentive. Can you tell us anything else about that, C.J.? "
17975,c.j.,"No, but I can tell you that lumber, cocoa beans, aluminum and petroleum products are  the major exports of Cameroon. "
17976,sam, Then we're all set. 
17977,c.j.,Yeah. 
17978,josh,Can I have her for a second? 
17979,sam,Yeah. 
17980,c.j., Why do you ask him and not me? 
17981,josh,He looked in charge! 
17982,c.j.,Of where I go? 
17983,josh,Can we... please? C.J. and Josh walk outside and close the door. 
17984,c.j.,Did you hear they named John Marbury British Ambassador? 
17985,josh,"Yes, I did. "
17986,c.j.,Lord John Marbury? 
17987,josh,"I know, it's got to be like Davy Jones himself is showing up. "
17988,c.j.,"Okay, don't make fun of Davy Jones, all right? He once wrote me a letter. He took that  kind of time. And he still tours! Plus, my love for John Marbury is real, it's not a  schoolgirl crush. He calls me  'Princepessa.' "
17989,josh,Does he? 
17990,c.j.,Yeah. 
17991,josh,"Well, he calls Leo 'Gerald.' "
17992,c.j.,He's eccentric. 
17993,josh,Yeah. 
17994,c.j.,What do you need? 
17995,josh,Janice Barry is saying they're going to ask Cornelius Sykes to host the Will Rogers'  dinner. 
17996,c.j.,They know for sure? 
17997,josh,They're going to ask him on Monday. 
17998,c.j.,They're going to stir this up again. 
17999,josh,Yeah. 
18000,c.j.,He didn't laugh at the joke! How many more ways are there for me to say that? He didn't  laugh at the joke! 
18001,josh,You guys are friends. I was thinking... 
18002,c.j.,We're not friends. 
18003,josh,You know each other. 
18004,c.j.,I don't hang out with Corey Sykes! 
18005,josh,"Yeah, but you know him! "
18006,c.j., Where is he? 
18007,josh,"He's in New York, doing standup. I thought since you were going to be there, you... "
18008,c.j.,I'll see him tomorrow night. 
18009,josh,Thank you.  
18010,c.j.,He didn't laugh at the joke! 
18011,josh, You'll see him tomorrow night? 
18012,c.j.,Yes. 
18014,josh," Could you see that a meeting is arranged for tomorrow night in  New York with C.J., Cornelius Sykes, and no one else? "
18016,c.j.,Thank you! 
18018,josh,Yeah? 
18020,josh,Yeah? 
18022,josh,"That's a good idea, I'm gonna do that. "
18024,josh,No. 
18025,bartlet,"I think a lot of people don't realize that Swedes have lived in Sweden more than 5,000  years longer than nearly any other European people. "
18026,bartlet,"In fact, Gothic tribes from Sweden played a major role in the disintegration of the  Roman Empire, did they not? "
18027,bartlet,So you've got that to answer for! 
18028,bartlet,Congratulations. 
18029,leo,"Congratulations, Ambassador. "
18030,leo,Is he still holding you responsible for the fall of the Roman Empire? 
18031,leo,"Welcome to my world. I'll see you at the reception, right? "
18032,leo,Congratulations. 
18033,bartlet,"Sweden has a 100% literacy rate, Leo, a hundred percent! How do they do that? "
18034,leo,"Well, maybe, they don't and they also can't count. "
18035,bartlet,Maybe. 
18036,leo," Sir, I really think you should know... "
18037,bartlet,Yes? 
18038,leo,That nine out of ten criteria that the DOD lays down for success in these tests were met. 
18039,bartlet,The tenth being? 
18040,leo,They missed the target. 
18041,bartlet, Damn! 
18042,leo,Sir! 
18043,bartlet,So close. 
18044,leo,Mr. President. 
18045,bartlet,"That tenth one! See, if there were just nine... "
18046,leo,"Look, the tracking software on the KM vehicle clearly acquired a read on both the  target and the decoy. "
18047,leo,"And, for the first time ever, successfully rendered a clean identification differential. "
18048,bartlet,"Leo, seriously, when they were telling you that on the phone, how stupid did you think  you'd sound saying that to me? "
18049,leo,This project needs money! 
18050,bartlet,It doesn't work. 
18051,leo,"Neither did several phases of Apollo 11, but Neil Armstrong claims it was a success. "
18052,bartlet,Do we need to decide this right now? 
18053,leo,No. 
18054,bartlet,Okay. 
18055,leo,"So, about the GDC speech... "
18056,bartlet, Yeah? 
18057,leo,"Since we're giving them exactly what they want, Toby thinks it's not such a bad idea  if we signal our independence as well. "
18058,bartlet,How? 
18059,leo,A drop-in. Eco-terrorism that's gone unadmonished by the GDC. 
18060,bartlet,For example? 
18061,leo,A ski development in Colorado that threatened a rare lynx was burned in protest. 
18062,bartlet,And we can't take it for granted that everyone pretty much fundamentally opposes arson? 
18063,leo,A year and a half ago you stood in the Mural Room and took Al Caldwell's head off because  the Christian League hadn't publicly admonished religious extremists. 
18064,bartlet,It would be hypocrisy not to hold our friends to the same standard... 
18065,leo,Yes. 
18066,bartlet,Yet it feels strange to score political points by doing the right thing. 
18067,leo,Yeah. 
18068,bartlet, I'm victim to my own purity of character.
18069,leo,"Whatever.  We'll get you some information on the lynx, which is a kind of a possum,  I think. "
18070,bartlet,"Okay, well, it's not a kind of a possum, so why don't you get me that information.  Toby doesn't want it in the speech? "
18071,leo,Just the drop-in. 
18072,bartlet,Did you hear? 
18073,leo,About Marbury? 
18074,bartlet,Ain't it great? 
18075,leo,"Yes, sir. And I assume you're enjoying my suffering? "
18076,bartlet,Absolutely. 
18077,leo,Anything else? 
18078,bartlet,No. 
18079,leo,"Thank you, Mr. President. "
18080,bartlet," 2,000 environmentalists are going to try to kill me tomorrow night! "
18081,bartlet,They're going to come at me with vegan food and pitchforks! 
18082,bartlet,"Still, I'd like you to get between me and any boiled seaweed you see coming my way. "
18083,toby,Mr. President. 
18084,bartlet,Leo just talked to me. 
18085,toby,About the GDC tonight. 
18086,bartlet,"Yeah, I'm not doing this for the politics, I'm doing it because it's the right thing  to do. "
18087,toby,"Well, I'm doing it for the politics. "
18088,bartlet,A lynx isn't a possum. 
18089,toby,I think it's in the possum family. 
18090,bartlet,It's a cat. 
18091,toby,"Oh, and we don't have enough of those."
18092,bartlet,How did Sam feel about this?  Toby? 
18093,toby,"This isn't government camp, it's not like... it's not important that everybody gets to  play! "
18094,bartlet,"I'm not going to tell you how to run your office, Toby. "
18095,toby,"Thank you, sir. "
18096,bartlet, Vegan food. Coming at me all night long. 
18097,c.j.,Yeah. 
18098,toby,Where are you going? 
18099,c.j.,"New York, New York, Toby. The town so nice they named it twice. "
18100,toby,What are you doing there? 
18101,c.j.,I'm receiving the Matrix Award from New York women in communications. 
18102,toby,For what? 
18103,c.j.,"I discovered a comet. What do you mean, 'for what?' "
18104,toby,Look...
18105,c.j.,"Past winners, by the way, include Cokie Roberts, Diane Sawyer and Ms. Leslie Stahl. "
18106,toby,Josh talked to you about... 
18107,c.j.,"Yeah, I'm meeting him for a drink after the thing. "
18108,toby,You briefed on the Clean Air Rehabilitation...? 
18109,c.j.,Yeah. 
18110,toby,"Okay, you might need this:  "
18111,c.j.,He's gonna do a drop-in? 
18112,toby,Yeah. 
18113,c.j.,I'll see you tomorrow night. 
18114,toby,Yeah. 
18115,sam, Climate changes have accelerated. Glaciers are shrinking.  Polar sea ice is... what? 
18116,toby, It's thinning. 
18117,sam,The polar sea ice is thinning causing a rise in sea levels round the globe. 
18118,toby,"And what do we say when they say, ""But changes in the Clean Air Rehabilitation effort  seriously choke the auto, trucking and utility business""? "
18119,toby,Public health benefits? 
18120,sam,We'll make that clear.  Where's C.J.? 
18121,toby,She's in New York. 
18122,sam,What's she doing in New York? 
18123,toby,She had a lunch - media women... women of media? 
18124,sam,That was this afternoon. 
18125,toby,She had to stay around. 
18126,sam,So it's just me? 
18127,toby,Yeah. Call me from the place. 
18128,sam,Yeah. 
18129,sam,Final draft?
18130,sam,Was that sass? 
18131,sam,"Okay. The difference between a good speech and a great speech is the energy with which  the audience comes to their feet at the end. Is it polite? Is it a chore? Are they  standing up because their boss just stood up? No, we want it to come from their socks.  We've got a half an hour. Let's read this again. "
18132,leo,"Every time one of these tests fails, congressional Democrats jump on it as a reason to  kill the program. "
18133,josh,You're not going to turn the President around on the missile shield. 
18134,leo,"Well, I'm not going to turn him around today. And probably not tomorrow. But as long as  somebody has the money to keep trying to make it work, then I'm fine. "
18135,leo,Yeah? 
18136,leo,Who? 
18137,leo,"Oh, God. "
18138,leo,"Good to see you, ambassador. "
18139,leo,"They do seem to strongly insist upon that, yes. "
18140,leo,"Thank you, I'll tell her. "
18141,leo,John?
18142,leo,Leo McGarry. 
18143,josh,"Good to see you, ambassador. "
18144,josh," Thank you, sir. "
18145,leo,Yes. 
18146,leo,"John, we do that later with the President. "
18147,leo,"I will tell you, though, that I personally welcome you and I look forward to our new  partnership. "
18148,leo,"I know we've had our differences in the past but I think you know I respect you.  I congratulate you on this auspicious occasion. As a matter of fact, the timing  of your arrival couldn't be better. "
18149,josh,Leo's trying to convince the President to give the NMD more time. 
18150,leo,And you're an expert in the field. And I hope I can count on your support. 
18151,leo,Why not? 
18152,josh,"Ah, detente. "
18153,leo,We're going to have this out. 
18154,leo,Let's go get you knighted or whatever the hell it is we do. 
18155,c.j.,"Hey, how you doing? "
18156,c.j.,Thanks for taking the time. 
18157,c.j.,I won't take long.
18158,c.j.,I gotta get the 7:00 shuttle. 
18159,c.j.,"Uh, a club soda. "
18160,c.j.,"Oh, I haven't seen the movie yet. "
18161,c.j.,That's what everyone's saying. 
18162,c.j.," So, you know, this is about the Will Rogers dinner. "
18163,c.j.,They're going to ask you to host and obviously the President's going to be there.   We appreciate the support. 
18164,c.j.,We think the press'll go back two years and bring up the whole...
18165,c.j.,"I don't want to. Uh, you know how I feel about you. You know I don't mean you disrespect. "
18166,c.j.,No! 
18167,c.j.,That's not...
18168,leo,Yes. 
18169,leo,That depends what your definition is. 
18170,bartlet, John! 
18171,bartlet, It's good to have you here. 
18172,bartlet,What made you agree to take the post? 
18173,josh,Reasonable bet.
18174,bartlet,"Listen, I gotta go a few blocks across town to give an address on global warming and the  future of our planet. That's not something you're interested in, right? "
18175,bartlet,"Okay. Well, stay here and fight with Leo about something. We'll get you some dinner.  I'll be back in an hour. We'll do your thing and then enjoy your reception. "
18176,leo,Indeed. 
18177,josh,Yes. 
18179,c.j.,Corey... 
18180,c.j.,"No, wait a second... "
18181,c.j.,It was not a benign joke. 
18182,c.j.,You don't tell benign jokes. 
18183,c.j.,It was a joke about New York City cops shooting black men.
18184,c.j.,It was a political fundraiser in the heat of a national campaign. You weren't doing a  2 a.m. set at Catch a Rising Star. 
18185,c.j.,"You made the joke, and inoffensive as you think it may have been, there was enormous  pressure on the candidate to disavow your remarks and he did not."
18186,c.j.,Corey... 
18187,c.j.,"We were courting law enforcement, Corey. Don't be naive. "
18188,c.j.,What did you expect us to do? 
18189,c.j.,Corey... 
18190,c.j.,Yeah. 
18191,c.j., I understand.
18192,c.j.," You did. Okay, I gotta go. "
18193,toby,Is the President offstage yet?
18194,toby,Anyone know how it's going?
18195,toby,Yeah?
18196,toby,Yeah.  Yeah?
18197,sam, He admonished them. 
18198,toby,Sam... 
18199,sam,He went off the speech right at the end and slapped them down for not speaking out... 
18200,toby,Yeah. 
18201,sam,...on eco-terrorism. 
18202,toby,Listen. 
18203,sam,He flew right off the speech. 
18204,toby,"Sam, listen. "
18205,sam,Something about a Colorado ski resort. 
18206,toby,"Sam, are you listening? "
18207,sam,Talk to me. 
18208,toby,"Here's what you say, ""Friends are honest with each other. The President has always  spoken out on moderate groups not taking responsibility for terrorism and he isn't  going to stop with the environmental lobby."" "
18209,sam,Okay. 
18210,toby,You got that? 
18211,sam,Yeah. 
18212,toby," Sam, what's happening? "
18213,sam, They're not standing. 
18218,c.j.,Yeah. 
18219,sam,You just get back? 
18220,c.j.,Yeah. 
18221,sam,You heard what happened?
18222,c.j.,"Yeah. Here's what it is: the President has always spoken out on moderate groups not  taking responsibility for extremism, and he isn't going to stop at the environmental  lobby. Friends are honest with each other.  Sam? "
18223,sam,Have you spoken to Toby? 
18224,c.j.,When? 
18225,sam,Since after the speech tonight.
18226,c.j.,No. 
18227,sam,Okay. 
18228,c.j.,They're setting up for the reception? 
18229,sam,Yeah. 
18230,toby,Sixty billion dollars can be spent on other things.
18231,leo,I'm all for retention pay. I'm all for health benefits. I'm all for procurement.
18232,toby,"I'm talking about Abrams' tax and Apache helicopters, which we know work."
18233,leo,"An Apache helicopter will not stop a Shahab 3 longrange stiletto, or a North Korean ICBM."
18234,toby,"Well so far neither can anything else.  Hey, Sam? "
18235,leo,I'm going back in there.
18236,toby,Have you been getting questions? 
18237,sam,I'm sorry? 
18238,toby,Have you been getting questions? 
18239,sam,Yeah. 
18240,toby,"From the press, or...?"
18241,sam,The press'll be tomorrow.
18242,toby,So who's asking?
18243,sam,The chairman of the GDC. Four Congressmen. The Secretary of the Interior. Who'd you  think would be talking to me?
18244,toby,Then what did you...?
18245,sam,"I said, ""Sometimes friends have to be honest with each other."" I said exactly what you  told me to say, which, coincidentally, is exactly C.J. told me to say, which is  remarkable when you consider that C.J. was in New York during the event and didn't  speak to you afterward. I mean, it's almost as if there were people who knew it was  going to happen."
18246,toby,Sam...
18247,sam,Get away from me.
18248,sam,Is it possible I could get in for just a minute?
18253,leo,Hello. 
18255,leo,Am I interrupting? 
18257,leo,Yeah. That was just a few years before we opened up a big can of whoopass on him at  Yorktown. 
18258,leo,"How can you look at North Korea, which 24 months ago fired a Taepodong missile...? "
18259,leo,And with some modifications it'll be able to reach Alaska. 
18260,leo,You know what I haven't forgotten?
18261,leo,That we opened up a big can of whoopass on you at Yorktown!
18262,leo,Excuse me.
18264,toby,"No, no, Alice. I got it."
18265,sam,It's all right.
18266,toby,"No, I got it."
18267,toby,Yeah. Thanks.
18268,toby,You don't ever go into the Oval Office mad.
18269,sam,Look...
18270,toby,"No, no, no. No, Sam. You don't ever go in there mad."
18271,sam,"I think the President's remarks were ill advised, to say the least."
18272,toby,You're wrong.
18273,sam,"The drop-in's the story now, Toby, not the energy package."
18274,toby,The energy package doesn't need to be a story; it's going to be a law.
18275,sam,You don't think we're going to need the environmental lobby?
18276,toby,"I think we need them, I just don't think we're going to lose them."
18277,sam,And I think you're tragically misguided.
18278,toby,Sam...
18279,sam,"Many, if not most, environmentalists are absolutists who will use this insult to pull  their support under cover we cut a deal in Detroit."
18280,toby,"Well then they can grow up, Sam. Use this insult? They just got the energy package they  wanted, they just got the president at their dinner, and they should shut up!"
18281,sam,"Well you should explain it to them just that way, Toby, cause they're really pretty  receptive to that argument."
18282,toby,"When they look down the ballot and see the alternatives, they get receptive in a hurry."
18283,sam,"Was there anything else, or can I sit here now?"
18284,toby, You can sit here. I'll see you tomorrow.
18285,sam,Yeah.
18286,toby,"Sam, I'm looking at opposition polling that scares the hell out of me. I'm looking at  internal numbers that change by the hour. I'm listening to economists that tell me  there's weather..."
18287,sam,You left me out. 
18288,toby, Yeah. 
18289,sam,You think I'm the reason you got beat on the Leadership Breakfast?
18290,toby,"I got creamed, Sam."
18291,sam,You think I'm the reason?
18292,toby,I don't want that discussion. 
18293,sam,"Then what are you doing here talking to me? Now you want the discussion. You and the  president may think they deserved it, but this cynicism of attacking your friends for  political protection offends them and it offends me. It offends you, and there's really  nothing I can do to make you feel better about that. "
18294,toby,We can't govern if we don't win. 
18295,sam,You should've talked to me about the numbers more. 
18296,toby,Anyway. I have this beer...
18297,sam,Yeah.
18298,toby,I was just gonna sit down and drink it.
18299,sam,Yeah.
18300,toby,"I mean, we don't have to talk or anything."
18301,sam,Yeah.
18302,bartlet,"That was Chairwoman Shelly Lubis I just got off the phone with. Before that was a  conference call with Jamie Schwartz of the Environmental Defense Fund, Bryce Davis  of the Sierra Club, and three Democratic Congressman from the Subcommittee on Energy  and the Environment. The number of different words they had for ""manipulative,""  Leo, there's no way they didn't have a thesaurus open in front of them. Bryce Davis  said if I keep this up, he's going to encourage Seth Gillette in a thirdparty bid."
18303,leo,What'd you say?
18304,bartlet,"I said for fifty bucks and a ride to the airport, Gillette could have the job right now."
18305,leo,What'd you say?
18306,bartlet,I politely reminded him that it's probably not a good idea to threaten the president.   I want to know when you're pushing me towards the missile  shield it's not because you want me to look strong on defense.
18307,bartlet,Would you tell Charlie I'm ready?
18308,leo,I'm not. I'm pushing you to the missile defense shield cause I think it works.
18309,bartlet,Based on what?
18310,leo,Confidence. And the understanding that there's been a time in the evolution of everything  that works when it didn't work.
18311,josh,"You know, can I say this? Why don't we just give the sixty billion dollars to North Korea  in exchange for not bombing us?"
18312,bartlet,It's almost hard to believe that you're not on the National Security Council.
18313,josh,I know. I feel like they're missing an important voice.
18314,bartlet,"John! Let me explain why you've been waiting. I have to see people in the order they  arrive, and you got beat by Argentina."
18315,bartlet,You also lost out on preferred seating for the State of the Union. 
18316,bartlet,Yes! 
18317,bartlet,Okay. Tom? 
18318,bartlet,Where are you on the missile shield?
18319,bartlet,Leo?
18320,leo,I think the world invented a nuclear weapon. I think the world owes it to itself to see  if it can't invent something that would make it irrelevant.
18321,bartlet,"Well, it's a discussion for serious men. They say a statesman is a politician who's  been dead for fifteen years. I'd like us to be statesmen while we're still alive.  Lord Marbury, I accept your letter of credence from Queen Elizabeth, and, by affixing  my signature and seal, do hereby declare you to be Ambassador Extraordinary and  Plenipotentiary."
18322,leo,Congratulations.
18323,leo,God Save the Queen.
18324,bartlet,Let's go.
18325,sam, Is that a yes?  Is it a yes?
18326,toby,Sam...
18327,sam, Be half a minute.
18328,toby,Mr. Pettit?
18329,toby,Delete 'vigorously' from the first sentence.
18330,leo,Which paragraph?
18331,toby,367.
18332,toby,"No, we’re just gonna pursue it regularly."
18333,toby,Not tonight.  Change chokehold to tight grip.
18334,toby,"No, Sam’s still on it. "
18335,bartlet,Where are we?
18336,leo,Sam’s still on.
18337,bartlet,Bob Novak just said this was the speech of my political life. You know how many times  I’ve heard that?
18338,toby,"Sir, Senator McGowan say’s we’re fine if we cut 'vigorously.'"
18339,bartlet,Do it.
18340,leo,How you feeling?
18341,bartlet,Good.
18342,bartlet,Abbey’s already in her seat?
18343,bartlet," I said, my wife’s in her seat?"
18344,leo,We’ll get him in the car. Let’s go.
18345,leo,What did they say?
18346,sam, We put our weight behind Sp 380. It’s a highway improvement bill.
18347,leo,What else?
18348,sam,Set aside some U.S. park land...
18349,leo,What else?
18350,sam,That’s it.
18351,leo,I want to be clear. This is the understanding we build him a highway and name a  park after him and we have the support for the Blue Ribbon?
18352,sam,Yep.
18353,leo,Mr. President...
18354,bartlet,Do it.
18355,toby,Ginger!
18356,toby,Tell C.J. the green light on the Blue Ribbon. She’ll know what it means.
18357,sam, We’ll write in the car!
18358,leo,Sir...
18359,bartlet,Yeah.
18360,leo,It’s a good thing.
18361,bartlet,The Blue Ribbon...
18362,leo,Yeah.
18363,bartlet,Yeah.
18364,josh,Excuse me... What are you doing?
18365,josh,You were putting gum in your mouth?
18366,josh,'Cause that’s a good idea to be chewing gum when you’re taking a poll for the President  of the United States. That’s the sound people like to hear over the phone.
18367,josh,"Well, thank you... Mr. Helper."
18369,josh,Yeah.
18371,josh,They’re not our people.
18373,josh,None of them have accents?
18375,josh,I’m saying Joey Lucas is deaf. She would have NO way of knowing...
18377,josh, Do any of you people have accents? 
18379,josh,Do any of you people have the power of speech?
18381,josh,I should be there right now.
18383,leo," ""...the members of both parties to join me in establishing a Blue Ribbon  National Commission to fashion..."""
18384,bartlet, Yeah.
18385,leo, I want it for him when he walks in the door.
18386,c.j.,Excuse me. I’ve got a heads up! There’ll be a last minute addition.
18387,c.j.,The President will be announcing a bipartisan Blue Ribbon Commission to study the  long-term future Entitlement Programs. Obviously there will be more details in the  address.
18388,c.j.,You know when I say 'last minute' I’m wrong. We’re just under three minutes.
18389,c.j.,It’s something he’s been going back and forth on. He wanted to make sure he had the  support of the Democratic leadership.
18390,c.j.,"Yes. I also wanted to remind you that ""Capital Beat"" will be broadcasting live from the  West Wing for the two or three hours following the address so that area is gonna be off  limits for carousing."
18391,c.j.,Yes.
18392,c.j.,Because they’re special. Enjoy the show everybody. 
18393,toby,...blunders and abandoning our ideological... what?
18394,sam,Entrenchment.
18395,toby,Those of us in the future will demand boldly putting aside our partisan blinders and  abandoning our ideological... entrenchment.
18396,sam,Yeah.
18397,toby, That’s it.
18398,sam,Okay.
18399,toby,This is it.
18400,sam,Yeah.
18401,toby, Phone it to the Prompter.
18402,toby,Mr. President.
18403,bartlet,Thanks.
18404,bartlet, Amen.
18405,bartlet,"Mr. Finney, would you tell the Speaker I’d like to see him please?"
18406,josh, Tell me about it.
18408,josh,"Up there is where this President eats! That is his place of business. Yes, he did well."
18410,josh,Let’s find out how well.
18412,josh,Yeah.
18414,josh,"So, what do I do?"
18416,josh,What do I tell them?
18418,josh,Didn’t you talk to Joey?
18420,josh,What did she say?
18422,josh, What did she say I should tell the callers?
18424,josh,Donna!
18426,josh,They’re not supposed to receive special instructions based on...
18428,josh,Time zones!? I don’t know. I’m... I’m not a pollster. I thought Joey called.
18430,josh,When is she gonna be here?
18431,josh,"Kenny, really, that better had been her talking."
18432,josh,Where the hell you been?
18433,josh,This is the State of the Union. There was nothing you could do about it?
18434,josh,Is this the kind of Noel Cowardesque wit I can expect all night long?
18435,josh,I want to start the phone banks. They need instructions.
18436,josh,I had already taken care of the gum thing...
18437,c.j.," 14. You know, Mark, the President is a commanding public speaker  and the bar is usually set quite a bit higher when it’s a major address but tonight he  cleared it with room to spare."
18438,c.j.,I have 72 times but I’ll take your count.
18439,c.j.,Yes...
18440,c.j.,It’s cable! Carol...
18441,sam, Can I see you a moment?
18442,c.j.,Yeah.
18443,sam,Can I see you over there?
18444,c.j.,Can we do it here?
18445,sam,Why?
18446,c.j.,I’m not wearing any pants. Can we do it here?
18447,sam,"Sure, we’re fine here as long as there aren’t any microphones or cameras around."
18448,c.j.,Carol!
18449,c.j.,Thank you.
18450,sam,You look like a Rockette.
18451,c.j.,Yeah.
18452,sam,Yeah.
18453,c.j., You know why I’m not wearing any pants?
18454,sam,I just assumed it was the usual reason.
18455,c.j.,I sat in paint. 
18456,c.j.,After the speech I went to the sculpture garden to get some air and take it in and I  sat on a bench.
18457,sam,And it didn’t say wet paint?
18458,c.j.,"It did it turns out, but..."
18459,sam,Where’d you get the bathrobe?
18460,sam,They have bathrobes at the gym?
18461,c.j.,In the women’s locker room.
18462,sam,But not the men’s. 
18463,c.j.,Yeah.
18464,sam,"Now, that’s outrageous. There’s a thousand men working here and 50 women..."
18465,c.j.,"Yeah, and it’s the bathrobe’s that’s outrageous. "
18466,c.j.,What’s going on?
18467,sam,Jack Sloane has an official reprimand in his jacket.
18468,c.j.,For what?
18469,sam,Excessive force.
18470,c.j., How long ago?
18471,sam,17 years ago. There was a criminal charge... it was dismissed. There was a civil suit...  it was dismissed. There was enormous community and political pressure from local Black  Democrats. 
18472,c.j.,Our people?
18473,sam,17 years ago...
18474,c.j.,"Okay, so they gave him an official condemnation. "
18475,sam,Yeah.
18476,c.j.,Does anybody have the story yet?
18477,sam,They will.
18478,c.j.,I... 
18479,c.j.,I need to see the Police Officer. What was his name?
18480,sam,Sloane!
18481,c.j.,Right! 
18495,sam,See? You guys said I couldn’t write comedy.
18496,leo,You talk to C.J.?
18497,sam,Yeah.
18498,leo,"The Dial groups are huge... middle class tax cuts, Social Security."
18499,sam,What about polling?
18500,leo,Josh and Joey will have early numbers in an hour. My point is this police officer...  The President pointed to him and asked him to stand.
18501,sam,Let C.J. talk to him.
18502,leo,Is he here?
18503,sam,Yeah.
18504,leo,No pictures anywhere near the President.
18505,sam,Yeah. 
18506,leo,What’s going on?
18507,leo,Where?
18508,leo,Was it the C.R.F?
18509,leo,Do we think it was the C.R.F?
18510,leo,Can the Agents be identified as U.S. Drug Enforcement?
18511,leo,On a road from Bogotá to Putumayo? They’re gonna shoot these guys.
18512,leo,"The White House Press Corps's upstairs and there’s a live T.V. show being broadcast  next door.  I need to meet with State, Justice, and the Pentagon...  and it needs to happen softly. "
18513,leo,This was almost a good night.
18516,josh, Jack Sloane was reprimanded for excessive force by the Detroit Police  Department.
18518,josh,17 years.
18520,josh,I don’t know. He made a bust. He broke the guys leg. The DA couldn’t make a case.  The civil suit was dismissed but it’s there.
18521,josh,From tonight. 
18522,josh,The police officer.
18523,josh,Officer Jack Sloane of the Detroit Police Department was added at the last minute to  the invited guests that are recognized by the President during the speech.
18526,josh, It was last minute. When do I see numbers?
18528,josh,Great! When do I see numbers?
18529,josh,Fantastic. When do I see numbers?
18530,josh,"I need numbers, Tonto!"
18531,josh,You get early numbers....
18532,josh,"So, what do you do in the meantime?"
18533,josh,Okay. 
18534,josh,"I’m plagued by this nonsense, Donna. I swear, it’s just reaching epidemic proportions.  Those numbers are gonna tell us we had a big night and the balance is gonna be dragged down  by a news cycle that won’t shake the cops. "
18536,josh,I’m sorry?
18538,josh,The night to do what?
18540,josh,Get a doughnut!
18542,leo,Are we verifying exactly who was at the Lab?
18543,leo,I don’t want to misnotify the families.
18544,leo,"Mickey, 2:00 P.M. local time in Bogotá, 5 DEA Agents assisting police in evidence  gathering at a cocaine lab were taken by the CRF."
18545,leo,We think so.
18546,leo,Who are they talking too?
18547,leo,Get me everything on him.
18548,leo,Is there anybody close by on the ground?
18549,leo,Who’s there?
18550,leo,Really.
18551,leo,How many people are gonna be guarding wherever these guys are being taken too?
18552,leo,Not the numbers you’re hoping for if you’re contemplating a massive attack and  rescue mission.
18553,leo,Tell Special Operations Command at Ft. Bragg to submit three plans for a unilateral op.  They have an hour.
18554,leo, We should let these 19 guys at Tres Encinas know they’re in it now too.
18555,sam,"Hey, Gracie..."
18556,sam,"Mark, she have time?"
18557,sam,Yes.
18558,sam,Yes. 
18559,sam,You know what I’d like? I’d like if you didn’t say you weren’t 100% sure the President’s  proposal isn’t Constitutional. 
18560,sam,They did a fine job of making it’s without the help of the President’s lawyer.
18561,sam,How have you never met the President?
18562,sam,You’ve been working here 3 months.
18563,sam,I’ll set up an introduction.
18564,sam,You can meet him tonight.
18565,sam,It’s no problem.
18566,sam, Are you scared to meet the President?
18567,sam,"Yeah, you are."
18568,sam,Ainsley...
18569,sam,That sounds pretty bad.
18570,sam,And that sounds really bad.
18571,sam,"Okay, well when you meet him, you meet him."
18572,sam,"Right.  Okay, can I talk to you about adrenaline for a second?"
18573,sam,"Yeah. You’re feeling it right now and it’s gonna get even more cause it’s a big night,  and you were a hit and you’ve never experienced anything like this."
18574,sam,I’m saying don’t drink until you’re off television.
18575,sam,"Yeah. And please don't forget you’re a blond, Republican girl and that nobody likes you."
18576,sam,Try to remember you’re on our side.
18578,leo, Your hair looks great by the way.
18580,leo,"C.J.’s on it. So, we were able to get the language in about the Blue Ribbon Commission. "
18582,leo,We were able to get it in at the last minute. We got our guys who changed the language to  broaden the...
18584,leo,"We changed the language at the last minute, Abbey. If you want to be pissed at someone, the  architect of..."
18587,toby,"Yes, Ma’am. "
18589,josh,Six out of ten were black or Hispanic.
18591,josh,No.
18593,josh,We’re still doing this?
18596,josh,What is taking so long? 
18598,josh,Why not?
18600,josh,You just said I always do.
18602,josh,Then I absolutely choose NOT helping me.
18605,josh,Sit down.  Where are the first numbers?
18606,josh,How soon?
18607,josh,You said five minutes 15 minutes ago!
18608,josh,Why?
18609,josh,"Yeah, but the response rate didn’t stop, right? Everybody didn't go to bed. If they did  that would be phenomenal. It would be a phenomenon!"
18610,josh,America is talking and I’m trying to hear what they’re saying.
18611,josh,"Well, I don’t think that is what they’re saying but absent any other information..."
18612,josh,"Joey, it’s the State of the Union. We worked on this speech for three months!"
18613,josh,In five minutes.
18614,toby,I don’t...
18615,toby,Because it doesn’t...
18616,toby,It doesn’t barely say that.
18617,toby,In fact it doesn’t say that at all. The only way it says that at all is if you remove some  words from it. 
18618,toby,"It says a well-regulated militia, being necessary for the security of the free state...  the government shall not infringe. The words regulated and militia are in the first sentence.  I don’t think the Framer’s were thinking of three guys in a Dodge Durango. "
18619,toby,"No. But I do know that if you combine the populations of Great Britain, France, Germany,  Japan, Switzerland, Sweden, Denmark and Australia you’ve got a population roughly the size  of the United States. We had 32,000 gun deaths last year and they had 112. Do you think it’s  because Americans are more homicidal by nature? Or do you think it’s because those guys have  gun control laws?"
18620,toby,"Mark, I’m gonna sit out the next segment."
18621,toby,"Yeah, I’ve got to see someone. I’ll get you a body.  Has she been waiting long?"
18622,toby,I’m sorry I’m late. 
18624,toby,I was on the air.
18626,toby,Mrs. Bartlet...
18628,toby,Excuse me for interrupting. I just wanted to remind you that there’s press coming in and  out of this area. 
18630,toby,"No, ma’am."
18632,toby,"Mrs. Bartlet, the Blue Ribbon Commission..."
18635,toby,Mrs. Bartlet?
18637,toby,Look...
18639,toby,Abbey...
18641,toby,"It was in a section on education reform, Abbey and considering other options doesn’t mean  we’re caving on retirement age and you know it. So, what was your concern with the language?"
18643,toby,And our commitment is still absolute. We’re open to new ideas and that’s what it said.
18645,toby,"Believe me, we gave Republicans plenty to be pissed about... the surplus, missile  defense, capital gains. And I was just on T.V. for the 900th time and alienated gun  owners... to say nothing of people who own Dodge Durango’s. So, what exactly was your  problem with the language?"
18647,toby,Abbey...
18649,c.j.,He’s here?
18650,c.j.,Officer Sloane.
18651,c.j.,I’m C.J. Cregg.  I’m the White House Press Secretary and I’m  sorry to get you out of the party.
18652,c.j.,I’m sorry to be abrupt but I’m racing the clock a little bit.
18653,c.j.,Could you tell me what happen 17 years ago with a suspect named Walter Tapus?
18654,c.j.,I can access the information through the FBI and call the Wayne county DA...
18655,c.j.,I don’t think you do but if you’d like to call...
18656,c.j.,So you fractured his leg.
18657,c.j.,He said you kicked him repeatedly while he was handcuffed.
18658,c.j.,Officer...
18659,c.j.,Why didn’t you tell anybody this was on your record when you were invited here?
18660,c.j.,Yeah. 
18661,c.j.,"No, but I have to tell them."
18662,c.j.,Cause they’ll find out and I have to stay ahead of the pitch. If I issue it in a brief  statement then it doesn't look like we’re trying to hide anything and I get to control  the story for a while.
18663,c.j.,Officer...
18664,c.j.,The President pointed to you as an example.
18665,c.j.,It’s a story.
18666,c.j.,Cause they’ll find it anyway.
18667,c.j.,"Yes, I do."
18668,c.j.,You should go back there.
18669,c.j.,Don’t talk to anybody about this.
18670,c.j.,I wish you had said something to us before.
18672,josh,How is that good news?
18674,josh,When’s the power going back on?
18676,josh,Donna...
18678,josh,Call Sam.  I want the numbers!
18680,josh,You’re the only one who’s having fun with this. Nobody else is having fun with this.
18681,josh,Are those numbers safe?
18682,josh,Are we gonna be able to make the West Coast calls?
18683,josh,When’s that gonna be?
18684,josh,No.
18686,josh,Is that Sam?
18688,josh,Give it to me. 
18689,josh,Sam.
18690,sam,What’s going on?
18691,josh,The power’s down.
18692,sam,I know.
18693,josh,"We’re five minutes away from an East Coast sample. We got nothing west of Indiana, Illinois..."
18694,sam,You need anything?
18695,josh,"A lightning bolt, a key, and a kite."
18696,sam,Donna told me to tell you you should ask out Joey Lucas.
18697,josh,"Hey, can I tell ya Donna’s been acting kind of..."
18698,sam,I gotta go.
18699,sam, Sir.
18700,bartlet,How’s it going?
18701,sam,They lost power at National Strategies.
18702,bartlet,I heard.
18703,sam,"Yes, and I know a way you can repay me."
18704,bartlet,Repay you for what?
18705,sam,For you being wrong in the face of me being right.
18706,bartlet, I owe you money for that?
18707,sam,"Oh, not money, sir."
18708,bartlet,I owe you anything for that?
18709,bartlet, Thank you.
18710,sam,Ainsley Hayes has been working here for three months and she’s still a little frightened  of meeting you. If you should happen you run into her in the halls perhaps you could make  a point...  ...of introducing yourself and welcoming her personally.
18711,bartlet,Don’t you already get paid?
18712,sam,Randomly in the hallways in the next few days you two are bound to be in the same place  at the same time. Would you just... 
18713,bartlet, Is there anything in particular you’d like me to say?
18714,sam, And to keep up the good work.
18715,bartlet, That’s really good.
18716,sam, Yeah.
18717,bartlet,Yeah.
18718,leo,Mr. President.
18719,bartlet,What’s going on with the police officer?
18720,leo,C.J.’s looking into it.
18721,bartlet,We’re going to get knocked off the story by a...
18722,leo,The cop isn’t what’s going to knock us off the story.
18723,bartlet,What is?
18724,leo,We have a situation in Colombia.
18725,bartlet,They can be identified as drug agents?
18726,bartlet,"Yeah, they may have blown their cover. "
18727,bartlet,"Mickey, how do we know they’re still alive?"
18728,bartlet,And they kill our guys unless Santos releases Juan Aguilar from a prison in Bogotá.
18729,leo,It doesn’t matter.
18730,bartlet,Why not?
18731,leo,The Frente doesn’t care about Juan Aguilar and how long he stays in jail. They want to  kill these guys.
18732,leo,"They want to drag their bodies through the streets. These people provide 70% of the world’s  cocaine. They have 122,000 hectares of coca. The Putumaya region alone produced 400 billion  dollars in cocaine for them last year. The government has no control over the region. There  is no law and they’re gonna shoot these guys in the head and then have a parade. "
18733,bartlet,Robbie...
18734,bartlet,How long?
18735,bartlet,How many Frente casualties?
18736,leo,Do you care?
18737,bartlet, No.
18738,bartlet,You think we’re headed for Vietnam?
18739,bartlet,How?
18740,leo,"Lead to a war? We’re in a war. We’re sending people down there to fight a war on drugs.  These guys aren’t hostages, they’re prisoners."
18741,bartlet,How long is it going to take Special Forces to mobilize?
18742,bartlet," Well then, I want our people to keep talking to Nelson Guerra.  But in three hours I want to be ready to kick in the back door."
18743,bartlet,"Leo, I’d like the Senior Staff. Would you round them up? "
18744,leo,"Yes, sir."
18745,bartlet, I’ll be wandering the halls.
18746,leo,"Thank you, Mr. President."
18748,josh, What?
18750,josh,Yeah.
18752,josh,Yeah.
18754,josh,Yeah. 
18756,josh, Okay.
18757,josh,Joey... can I ask you what may be a silly question?
18758,josh,"It’s not possible is it for us to just open one of these computers with a screwdriver and  get the numbers that are in there, right?"
18759,josh, I WANT THESE NUMBERS!
18761,josh,Yeah.
18763,josh,Yeah.
18764,sam,You gotta come back.
18765,sam,I don’t know. Leo wants everybody back. Leave Joey and Donna for a while.
18766,josh,I’ll be right there.
18767,sam,Ginger?
18768,sam,Isn’t Ainsley Hayes supposed to be meeting me now?
18769,sam,Isn’t she supposed to be meeting me here?
18770,sam,Why?
18771,sam, Ainsley!
18772,sam,"Well, I hardly know where to start."
18773,sam,"You guys... really, there’s a wet paint sign on the bench."
18774,sam,Why are you moving like that?
18775,sam, Okay.
18776,sam,Is there any alcohol in that at all?
18777,sam,I came down here to tell you...
18778,bartlet, What’s up? 
18779,bartlet,I never even knew we HAD a nightclub down here.
18780,sam,"Mr. President, I don’t believe you’ve met Ainsley Hayes."
18781,bartlet,"Yeah. Ainsley, I wanted to say hello and to you know... mention ""a lot of people  assumed you were hired because you’re a blonde, republican sex kitten"" and well,  they’re obviously wrong. Keep up the good work. "
18782,bartlet, You know we’re meeting?
18783,sam,Yes sir. 
18784,sam,That could have been worse. 
18785,sam,"No, probably not. "
18786,c.j.,"Well, the reception's still going on. I don’t know if you can hear the music. And the  President and Mrs. Bartlet are likely to stay up late with friends."
18787,c.j.,How you holding out?
18788,c.j.,Yeah.
18789,c.j.,You know about Sloane.
18790,c.j.,Mark...
18791,c.j.,"Mark, I talked to the guy. And before the stampede begins... "
18792,c.j.,...please give me a chance...
18793,c.j.,Let me talk to you before...
18794,toby,Leo Mc Garry would like you to meet an old friend of his.
18795,c.j.,"Mark, give me 20 minutes before you break the story."
18796,c.j.,We’ve done things together.
18797,bartlet,Hey.
18799,bartlet,They said you were in here.
18801,bartlet, Fellas...
18802,bartlet,You’re mad at me.
18804,bartlet,"Abbey, so I indicated we were open to new ideas. How did I fail you this time?"
18806,bartlet,I have a meeting. 
18808,bartlet, Things had to be cut.
18810,bartlet,To make a 90 minute speech into an 80 minute speech things had to go.
18812,bartlet,Abbey.
18814,bartlet,Right now...
18816,bartlet,Abbey.
18818,bartlet, That’s not what tonight’s...
18820,bartlet,That was three years ago.
18822,bartlet,I have Special Forces headed to Columbia on ready alert. They'll be ready for an order  in a little less than three hours.
18824,bartlet,The Frente took five DEA Agents in Putumayo...
18825,bartlet,Yeah?
18826,bartlet,I’ll be right there.
18827,bartlet,Abbey...
18829,bartlet,All right.  I’ve got to go.
18831,leo,Mr. President? 
18832,bartlet,It was just three hours ago I gave the State of the Union. 
18833,leo,Yeah. 
18834,bartlet,Can you believe that? 
18835,leo, What are you doing? It's freezing out here. 
18836,bartlet,I'm not allowed to smoke inside anymore. 
18837,leo,I thought you were allowed to do pretty much whatever you want? 
18838,bartlet,Up to the point where you accidentally burn holes in priceless antiques. 
18839,leo,You should stop smoking. 
18840,bartlet,Why? 
18841,leo,You'll live longer. 
18842,bartlet,I smoke two cigarettes a day. 
18843,leo,It's a bad example. 
18844,bartlet,"For who... Russian spy satellites?  George Bernard Shaw says, ""You don't live  longer, it just seems longer."""
18845,leo,I'm not sure it was Shaw.
18846,bartlet,I'm not sure it was either.  Is it time?
18847,leo,Yeah.
18848,bartlet,Where are we? Everyone sits. 
18849,bartlet,Tell me what happens when I give the order.
18850,bartlet,What'll they do when they get there? 
18851,bartlet,Why? 
18852,leo,It'll be daylight by then. 
18853,bartlet,Nineteen guys are going to have to lie face down in the jungle until sunset? 
18854,bartlet,They're moving the hostages from where to where? 
18855,leo,On foot. 
18856,bartlet,Code name's Cassiopeia. 
18857,bartlet,"Mickey, you look like you want to say something. "
18858,leo,For what? 
18859,leo,Guerra wants Aguilar out of a Columbian prison. Are there any other circumstances under  which he's gonna give these hostages back? 
18860,leo,Crap!
18861,leo,What difference does it make if they're shot during a rescue or at the Frente  Command at Villa Cerreno? 
18862,bartlet,"Are we going to keep them alive longer, or is it just going to seem longer? "
18863,bartlet,I've been given reason to believe they'll be tortured at Villacerreno. They're U.S. drug  agents. They know things these people want to know.
18864,bartlet,Go. 
18865,c.j.,Officer Sloane? Would you be willing to go on television tomorrow? 
18866,c.j.,In the speech? 
18867,c.j., About 8700?
18868,c.j.,Would you be willing to go on T.V.? 
18869,c.j.,This is going to be a part of the news cycle tomorrow whether you go home or not. 
18870,c.j.,Roughly the same way I knew there were 8700 words in the speech. I have some experience  at this.
18871,c.j.,"You'll do a very quick satellite interview.  ""What was it like being at the  State of the Union?"" ""Did you meet the President""... It was a thrill and an honor.  ""Talk about your act of heroism that brought you to the attention of the White House...""  Well, I wouldn't really call it heroism but...""Now, I understand you had some trouble  back in the early 80's... I'm glad I have a chance to talk about that."" And you tell  your story just like you told it to me. "
18872,c.j.,Coat and tie. 
18873,c.j., Carol! 
18874,c.j.,Would you make sure officer Sloane gets back to his hotel? 
18875,c.j.,I was called in for a meeting. 
18876,c.j.,I was called in for a meeting...
18877,c.j.,"It's not midnight everywhere in the world, Mark! "
18878,c.j.,He's innocent. 
18879,c.j.,"No, a Grand Jury, a DA and a Civil Court Judge decided 17 years ago. Nobody brought  charges and the civil suit was dismissed. "
18880,c.j.,The Detroit police department cited him for excessive force to calm down the black  community. It was a robbery. They were climbing through windows and jumping over walls.  The guy's leg was already fractured when Sloane got there. He's going to do your show  tomorrow morning. 
18881,c.j.,No. 
18882,c.j.,'Cause you waited 40 minutes. 
18883,sam,Hey. 
18884,toby,Hey. 
18885,sam,Bill Dryer from Gillette's office called. He wants to have a meeting with you. 
18886,toby, Dryer? 
18887,sam,Gillette. 
18888,toby,I'll bet he wants to have a meeting with me. 
18889,sam,Yeah. 
18890,toby, It's not gonna happen.
18891,sam,Toby...
18892,toby,It's not gonna happen. 
18893,toby,We got enough input from him during the six weeks we were writing the thing. I don't  need to hear his...
18894,sam,He's very upset. 
18895,toby,I know. 
18896,sam,More I think than we calculated he was going to be. 
18897,toby,We've upset him? 
18898,sam,Yeah. 
18899,toby,"Well, we're going to have to learn to live with that pain. "
18900,sam,Look...
18901,toby,He's not the President of the United States. He's a junior Senator from North Dakota  where nobody lives! Cause it's too cold and they don't have a major sports franchise. 
18902,sam,Do I need to lay out the ways in which this man is important to us? 
18903,toby,No. 
18904,sam,He is adored by the Left. 
18905,toby,Stop laying out the ways.
18906,sam,He's our link to the Environmentalists. 
18907,toby,Stop laying out the ways! 
18908,sam,"Toby, asking for this meeting isn't out of line and you should take it. In fact you  should take it tomorrow morning at 7:30 at the Hyatt."
18909,toby,You set it up already?
18910,sam, Just the time and place.
18911,toby, And you expect me to explain myself to him. 
18912,sam,"Yes. Yes, I do. "
18913,toby, Fine. 
18914,sam,7:30.
18915,c.j.,"The Post is calling it  ""sleek, challenging, and often times witty.""  Not, unlike myself. "
18916,toby,Who's Jack Sloane and why am I just hearing about this now? 
18917,c.j.,Sloane was one of the invited guest. He was the police officer. 
18918,toby,The one we stepped in over the weekend? 
18919,c.j.,Yeah. 
18920,toby,And what happened? 
18921,c.j.,A long time ago he was cited by the Detroit Police Department for excessive force. 
18922,toby,Against a black suspect? 
18923,c.j.,Yeah. 
18924,toby, C.J.. 
18925,c.j.,Toby...
18926,toby,How was this guy not vetted?! 
18927,c.j.,Cause he wasn't. Cause it was last minute.
18928,toby,What are you doing about it? 
18929,c.j.,Mark Gottfried's going to interview him in the morning. 
18930,toby,It's a bad idea. 
18931,c.j.,Why? 
18932,toby,Why?! 
18933,c.j.,Yeah! 
18934,toby, Cause blacks aren't going to react well to our supporting a brutal cop. 
18935,c.j.,He's not a brutal cop. 
18936,toby,Says you! 
18937,c.j.," Says me, a Grand Jury, 2 Judges, the District Attorney and common sense! "
18938,c.j.,"It's going public anyway, Toby. Gottfried got the story on his own. "
18939,toby,Fine.  Where's Josh? 
18940,c.j.,He went back to the phone banks. 
18941,toby,Is the electricity back on? 
18942,c.j.,No. 
18943,toby,Then what's he doing there? 
18944,c.j.,Hoping the electricity goes on. 
18945,toby, Well that ought to do it. 
18947,josh,Yeah. 
18949,josh,Oh God.  Please don't...
18951,josh,Donna! 
18953,josh,She really doesn't! 
18955,josh,I'm really not! 
18957,josh,"No, you don't. "
18959,josh,I'm thinking of firing you. 
18961,josh,Among other things.  Yeah?
18962,josh,Why? 
18963,josh,Joey... 
18964,josh," Okay. Folks, we'll start over tomorrow night! "
18965,josh,Take it easy. 
18967,josh,I'm not good at waiting.
18969,josh,Donna... 
18971,josh,We're asking different questions. 
18974,josh,You're fired. 
18976,josh,Yeah.
18977,leo,Mr. President...
18978,bartlet,Yeah? 
18979,leo,"You understand we've got heating inside, right? "
18980,bartlet,This isn't cold. It's crisp. 
18981,leo,"No, it's cold. "
18982,bartlet,"Well, you're a big wussie. "
18983,leo,Knight to King 4. 
18984,bartlet,It'll leave the Bishop open. 
18985,leo,You're gonna sacrifice the Bishop for the Queen's rook. 
18986,bartlet,Where? 
18987,leo,Four moves down. 
18988,bartlet,Abbey's pretty pissed at me. 
18989,leo,How bad? 
18990,bartlet,Pretty bad. 
18991,leo,King's Knight 3. 
18992,bartlet,You know I have this image in my mind of the dead soldiers coming back from Vietnam...  the caskets coming off the plane. I don't know from where. 
18993,leo,Television. 
18994,bartlet, Caskets coming off the plane? 
18995,leo,Yeah. 
18996,bartlet,Are they down? 
18997,leo,Yeah. Delta's landed in Tres Encinas. Alpha moved out and will be in Villacerreno  at 0700. 
18998,bartlet,Where they'll wait. 
18999,leo,Yeah. 
19000,bartlet,I'll see you in the morning. 
19001,leo,Thank you Mr. President. 
19002,josh,Can I tell you something strange? 
19003,sam,Sure. 
19004,josh," All last night at the phone banks, Donna was telling me I should ask Joey  Lucas out. "
19005,sam,You should. 
19006,josh,Fine. But... that aside. What do you make about Donna being the one pushing...
19007,sam,I don't think anything. 
19008,josh,You wouldn't think she'd be jealous? 
19009,sam,She goes out with guys. Are you jealous? 
19010,josh,No. 
19011,sam,See. 
19012,josh, I don't get jealous. 
19013,sam,So? 
19014,josh,I don't like it and usually do everything within my considerable capabilities to  sabotage it. 
19015,sam,Yes. 
19016,josh, is a very attractive woman! 
19017,sam,Josh? 
19018,josh,Yeah. 
19019,sam,You know your voice just got really high at the end of that. 
19020,josh,"Yeah, sorry. "
19021,bartlet,Hey. 
19022,sam,"Good morning, sir. "
19023,bartlet,Thanks for having breakfast with me. 
19024,sam,Yes. 
19025,bartlet,Did you order something? 
19026,sam,"No sir, we were waiting for you. "
19027,bartlet, You want scrambled eggs? 
19028,sam,"Yeah, thanks. "
19029,bartlet,Could we get these guys some scrambled eggs? 
19030,bartlet,"No, I'm fine. "
19031,josh,"Then... we're fine, too. "
19032,sam,Yeah. 
19033,bartlet,No! 
19034,josh,"Sir, we're fine!"
19035,bartlet,"Bring them some food, would ya? "
19036,bartlet,You guys understand I can't discuss with you any rescue mission that may or may not be  in play right now? 
19037,sam,Of course. 
19038,josh,I'm assuming State has people negotiating with Nelson Guerra? 
19039,bartlet,Nelson Guerra wants me to tell President Santos to release Juan Aguilar from prison. 
19040,josh,I wouldn't make that phone call with a gun to my head. 
19041,bartlet,"I have a gun to my head and I'm not making that phone call. I inherited the war on drugs  from a President, who inherited it from a President, who inherited it from a President  before that. I'm not a hundred percent sure who we're fighting, but I know we're not  winning. Ten years ago we spent $5 billion fighting drugs and we did such a good job that  last year we spent $16 billion. Sixty percent of Federal prisoners are in jail on drug  charges as opposed to two and a half percent that are there for violent crime. We  imprison a higher percentage of our citizens than Russia did under Communism and South  Africa under Apartheid. Somewhere between 50 and 85 percent of our prison population has  a drug or alcohol abuse problem. We've tried ""just say no."" I don't think it's going to  work.  I'm mentioning this because I'd like you to give me any  thoughts you might have on the subject. "
19042,josh,"Thank you, Mr. President. "
19043,sam,"Thank you, sir. "
19044,sam,What are you doing here? 
19045,sam,Bonnie...
19046,sam, Are we releasing the names of the agents or are we not releasing them? 
19047,sam,At what? 
19048,sam, You met the President last night.
19049,sam,You sat in paint!
19050,sam,You were happy. 
19051,sam," Yeah, but not that much landed on your head. "
19052,sam, How is it my fault?
19053,sam,I'm not the one who got you jumping around like Joey Heatherton.
19054,sam,Arrange another introduction?
19055,sam,Last night you were scared to meet him.
19056,sam,You're just in your own little Euripides play over there aren't you?
19057,sam,Fine.
19058,sam,Yes.
19059,toby,Seth...
19060,toby,It happened five minutes before the man walked into the House chamber. You're a Junior  Senator from North Dakota and you don't get script approval  on the State of the  Union! 
19061,toby,Seth... 
19062,toby,What exactly is the danger of studying new options? 
19063,toby,Diverting General Revenue into the trust fund is not reform. 
19064,toby,How many votes did you get for it last year? 
19065,toby,Eighteen. 
19066,toby,"82 U.S. Senators think your reform bill sucks. So unless you have a plan for picking up  a majority, I don't know what's so wrong with saying we're open to hearing new ideas? "
19067,toby,It's simply not what we're doing.
19068,toby, Are there cameras on someplace? 
19069,toby,...and ruling the galaxy. 
19070,toby,"The President is not a member of your party. He is the leader of your party. And if you  think demonizing people who are trying to govern responsibly is the way to protect our  liberal base, then speaking as a liberal... go to bed, would you please! "
19071,toby,We admonished environmental terrorism. 
19072,toby,You in favor of it? 
19073,toby,We made more than we lost. 
19074,toby,You just named three groups that'll never desert the President. 
19075,toby,"I was just thinking about this cartoon I once saw. A bunch of tiny fish are swimming  through the leaves of the plant but then one of the fish realizes it's not a plant,  it's the tentacles of a predator. And the fish says, ""with friends like this, who needs  anemones?"" "
19076,toby,"Come at us from the left, I'm gonna own your ass. "
19084,bartlet, Hey. 
19085,bartlet, What was that about? 
19087,bartlet,Packing already? 
19089,bartlet,"You aren't leaving till tonight, right? "
19091,bartlet,Men and women are completely different in this regard. 
19093,bartlet,"I don't know. I just had breakfast with Sam and Josh. Toby's having breakfast with  Seth Gillette, who's every bit as pissed at me as you are."
19094,bartlet,"Abbey, can we..."
19096,bartlet,We didn't get a chance to talk again last night. 
19098,bartlet,Talk? 
19100,bartlet,Ever? 
19102,bartlet,Look...
19103,bartlet,Why? 
19106,bartlet, Yes and I'd like to go about my day without this black cloud around me so  I'd like to talk now! 
19108,bartlet," What are you, my Zen master? Can I be in charge of my own mind?! "
19110,bartlet, I feel better already. 
19111,josh,I'm on hold.  I'm in some hellish hold world of holding. 
19113,josh,I'm on hold. 
19115,josh,They did call us.
19117,josh, I'm on hold. 
19119,josh,That'll be a lot of fun. 
19121,josh,Hmm?  
19123,josh,There are five Congressional districts that are concerning me. 
19125,josh,Kentucky 3rd... that's Louisville. 
19127,josh,"Yeah, Louisiana 4th, Missouri 9th, Missouri 6th, and Ohio 12th. "
19129,josh,The President last night announced a crime package that would among other things...
19131,josh,The five Congressmen in those districts...
19133,josh,Right. 
19135,josh,Yes. 
19137,josh,Probably. 
19139,josh,Why are you asking me a question when you're going to have the conversation all by  yourself? 
19141,josh,I can hold the phone. 
19142,josh,Take the phone. 
19143,josh, Give me the phone. 
19144,josh,Why are you trying to... fix me up... with Joey Lucas? 
19146,josh,Fine. 
19148,josh, Thank you. 
19149,josh,The power's back on. 
19151,josh,Yes. 
19153,josh,We wait.
19154,c.j.,"How you doing, Ainsley? "
19155,c.j.,Okay... .
19156,sam,"Hey, you ready? "
19157,sam,You sure?
19158,sam,Let's go. 
19159,sam, Here we go!
19160,sam,Ainsley? 
19161,sam,What other time? 
19162,sam,What's a better time?
19163,sam,Don't you have to absolve yourself of the humiliation visited upon your family and the  House of Atrix? 
19164,sam,It'll never happen. 
19165,sam,"No, probably will. "
19166,leo, Hey. 
19167,sam,Is he coming? 
19168,leo,He's stopping in on his way from the... thing. 
19169,leo,"How you doing, Ainsley? "
19170,leo,"Okay. Well... now I am, too. "
19171,sam,Tell her it's going to be fine. 
19172,leo,Your skirt's on backwards. 
19173,leo,Yes. 
19174,leo,Ainsley...
19175,bartlet, Hey. 
19176,sam,"Good evening, Mr. President. "
19177,bartlet,Is she here? 
19178,sam,Ainsley Hayes? 
19179,bartlet,Yeah. 
19180,sam,"Yes, sir. "
19181,bartlet,Where is she? 
19182,sam,"Well, she's in the closet, Mr. President. "
19183,bartlet,Why? 
19184,sam,She thought it was a bathroom. 
19185,bartlet,Why is she still in there? 
19186,sam,"That's kind of hard to say, sir. "
19187,bartlet,Why don't we get her out here? 
19188,sam,Yeah.  Ainsley? 
19189,bartlet,"Ainsley, why don't come on out of there..."
19190,bartlet,How you doing? We met last night.  You were singing and dancing in a  bathrobe. 
19191,bartlet,Why were you in the closet? 
19192,bartlet,They won't let me smoke inside but you can pee in Leo's closet. 
19193,bartlet,"I appreciate you coming to work for me, Ainsley. You're an exceptionally bright young  woman. Is your father proud of you?"
19194,bartlet,I bet he is.  Listen...
19195,leo, Sam...
19196,bartlet,What happened? 
19197,bartlet,"Charlie, get the door. "
19198,bartlet,What happened? 
19199,bartlet,Did we lose the hostages? 
19200,bartlet,What are you talking about? 
19201,leo,"Oh, God..."
19202,bartlet,What are you talking about?! 
19203,bartlet,No...
19204,bartlet,How many guys were on the Blackhawk? 
19205,bartlet, So I've got nine more guys now on the ground we've got to get back. 
19206,leo,Mr. President...
19207,bartlet, They're dead. 
19208,bartlet,I want the President of Colombia on the phone. I want a translator in this room right now. 
19209,leo,Sir? 
19210,bartlet,How the hell did that happen? 
19211,leo, It was bad intelligence. 
19212,bartlet, YOU THINK!? 
19213,leo,Frente left behind a radio and a soldier at the outpost. And they were deliberately  sending misinformation. 
19214,bartlet,We've never anticipated the possibility that somebody might try that? 
19215,leo,Sir...
19216,bartlet, IS THAT HOW I JUST LOST NINE GUYS TO A DAMN STREET GANG WITH A HAM RADIO!?
19217,bartlet, AMERICAN 
19218,bartlet,Where are the bodies? 
19219,leo, They're on their way back. 
19220,bartlet,Where? 
19221,leo, Dover... around 4 a.m. 
19222,bartlet,Is somebody translating on the other end? 
19223,bartlet," Mr. President, this is the President of the United States. "
19224,bartlet," Mr. President, 90 minutes ago the United States invaded  Colombian airspace. Two Blackhawk helicopters went into Tres Encinas with 20 Delta  Commandos on intelligence that the hostages were being moved. One of the Blackhawks  was shot down. They were nine military fatalities."
19225,bartlet, I'd like to ask for your assistance in confirming that the five hostages  are still alive.
19226,leo,How's he know that? 
19227,bartlet, How do you know that?
19228,bartlet, Yes?
19229,bartlet," I'm not going to ask you, Miguel."
19230,bartlet, Say that again.
19231,bartlet," Well, I appreciate your making that offer but I don't think  that's a very good idea. "
19232,bartlet," Okay. Thank you, Mr. President."
19233,sam,"Wait, Toby..."
19234,toby," Hang on a second Sam, you give into terrorist demands and that's the ballgame! "
19235,sam,I understand the principle but there are real lives at stake! 
19236,toby,"Ah, it's real easy to stick to principles when nothing's at stake Sam! "
19237,sam," Well sir, let's argue principles when these five guys get home. "
19238,bartlet,Juan Aguilar runs one of the largest drug cartels in the world. 
19239,sam,Sir...
19240,bartlet,He has produced $15 billion worth of cocaine in two years. 
19241,bartlet,"He's murdered or ordered the murder of eight Supreme Court justices, a pro-extradition  Prime Minister and three Federal police officers in Bogotá. And from his prison cell I  guarantee you he orchestrated the kidnapping of five U.S. DEA agents and the killing  of their rescuers! "
19242,sam,"I believe he did it as well Mr. President, which is all then evidence you need that it  couldn't matter less whether Juan Aguilar is in prison, or not! "
19243,bartlet,I'm not letting him out.  I'll share a cell with him before I let  him out. I want military options! 
19244,leo,"Yes, sir. "
19245,toby,"Thank you, sir. "
19246,leo,"Thank you, Mr. President. "
19247,josh,Yeah? 
19249,josh,She'll bring me the numbers here? 
19252,josh,Colombia? 
19254,josh,You say get 'em home? 
19256,josh,And who calls the families of the nine commandos who just died trying to save five guys  it turns out we could've freed six hours ago. 
19258,josh,The good enough reason is you give in to terrorists it gives them a pretty good incentive  to keep terrorizing. 
19260,josh,How do you know? 
19262,josh,You don't think they're going to kidnap another five people tomorrow morning and demand  twelve months of free cable? 
19264,josh,How about the keys to the Situation Room? 
19266,josh,Where?  Did she say about an hour? 
19268,josh,Yeah. 
19270,bartlet,Do we know where they are? 
19271,bartlet,What would it take to get them back?
19272,bartlet,Yeah. 
19273,bartlet,What would it take to wipe them out? 
19274,bartlet,Yeah. What would it take? 
19275,bartlet, Half?
19276,bartlet, You've really got to ask yourself what's the point in being a Super Power  anymore. 
19281,bartlet, And then there's the repack! 
19282,bartlet,"First there's the preliminary, or the dry run. Then there's the actual packing.   Abbey, you're just going away for two days, right? "
19284,bartlet, Right? 
19286,bartlet,It was an ambush. 
19288,bartlet,"A guy with a shoulder thing shot down a Blackhawk. Everybody's dead.  Nine guys. Meanwhile, they've moved the hostages 60 miles into the jungle where we'd  need a pair of tweezers to get them out. "
19290,bartlet, No. 
19292,bartlet,No.  I didn't make the decision to run again. I wouldn't do that without you. 
19293,bartlet,"When, Abbey? "
19295,bartlet,I didn't make the decision to run again! 
19297,bartlet,"That's what we do, Abbey. We run for things! From the day a Congressman is sworn in he's  got to raise $10,000 a week so he can get reelected! A President gets to govern for 18  months. We try to get people to vote for us and in the process we hope the people force  us to do good things. "
19299,bartlet," Yes, we had a deal. "
19303,bartlet, Abbey...
19305,bartlet,I've had one episode in two years. 
19307,bartlet, I know what it's going to...
19309,bartlet,Look...
19313,bartlet, Yeah. 
19315,bartlet,Have a good trip. 
19316,bartlet,Call me when you get there. 
19318,bartlet,I love you. 
19320,josh,Son of a bitch. 
19322,josh,"A five day waiting period, that's all. A person can't wait five days to buy a gun?  If someone needs a gun right now, right this second, isn't that something the public  should be concerned about? "
19324,josh,Yeah. 
19326,josh,What time is it? 
19328,josh,All right. We'll call it a full day. But come in early in the morning. 
19330,josh,You all right getting home? 
19332,josh,They're not gonna change. 
19333,josh,Five day waiting period... 
19334,josh,Yeah.
19335,josh,I didn't need nationwide. I needed those five districts. Now we're gonna have to dial  down the gun rhetoric in the Midwest. 
19336,josh,Because these numbers just told us that...
19337,josh,We know. 
19338,josh,Numbers don't lie. 
19339,josh,Believe me when I tell you that's not true. 
19340,josh, Yeah. 
19341,josh, Okay. 
19342,bartlet,"Hey, Charlie. You shouldn't be out here without a coat. "
19343,bartlet,Yeah?
19344,bartlet,No. Thanks.
19345,bartlet,Hey! 
19346,leo,I checked outside. I thought you'd be having a cigarette. 
19347,bartlet,"Let me tell you something, Leo...  After heroin and cocaine, tobacco is next. "
19348,leo,"Great. Another criminal empire we can give birth to. There'll be speakeasies all over  Chicago where you can get smuggled cartons of Marlboro lights.  I fought  a jungle war. I'm not doing it again. If I could put myself anywhere in time it would  be the Cabinet room on August 4, 1964, when our ships were attacked by North Vietnam  in the Tonkin Gulf. I'd say, Mr. President... don't do it. You're considering  authorizing a massive commitment of troops and throwing in our lot with torturers and  panderers. Leaders without principle and soldiers without conviction with no clear  mission, and no end in sight. This war is at home. The casualties are in our prisons,  and not our hospitals. The amount of money the American government is spending in  Colombia is the exact same amount American consumers are spending buying drugs from  Colombia. We're funding both sides of this war, and we'll never win it that way. "
19349,bartlet,"Leo, I can't possibly reverse our..."
19350,leo,No one...
19351,bartlet,I can't possibly reverse our position on negotiating...
19352,leo,"No one's gonna know. You don't make another phone call, it happens someplace else.  Santos is gonna be the one to let him out. "
19353,bartlet,There were just 14 people in this room who heard Santos make me the offer. 
19354,leo,Those fourteen people keep bigger secrets than this. 
19355,bartlet,You know what Truman Capote said was the bad part about living outside the law? 
19356,leo,What? 
19357,bartlet,"You no longer have the protection of it. What's to stop me? Two hundred CIA operatives...  Black Ops. Two hundred guys with no wives, no kids, no parents.  I send 200  operatives down there. Monday morning I read in the paper Juan Aguilar is dead. What's  to stop me? "
19358,leo," We lost this one, Mr. President. It was bad intelligence and we lost this one. "
19359,bartlet,It was the Queen's Rook. That's why I couldn't trade the Bishop. It was over six moves  ago. Arrange for their immediate release. 
19360,leo,"Yes, sir, Mr. President. "
19361,bartlet, If they so much as experience turbulence on their way out...
19362,leo,"Yes, sir."
19363,bartlet,I want to go to Dover later tonight. 
19364,leo," Yes, sir. "
19365,bartlet,Thank you. 
19366,leo,"Thank you, Mr. President. "
19367,c.j.,Good evening. Thank you for coming back so late. 
19368,c.j.,"... Pentagon, State Department and Justice Department who'll continue with your questions."
19369,c.j.,...Putumaya region of Colombia by members of the Frente. 
19370,bartlet,I'll call their families afterwards...
19371,c.j.,"...whose name we are not releasing at this time. President Miguel Santos, acting on his  own authority has..."
19373,josh,I'm done? 
19375,josh,"Efficiency, Donna. "
19377,josh,"Efficiency and professionalism, and we're out of here at nine o'clock on a Wednesday night. "
19379,josh,"Yeah, well, there does seem to be a little less work to do when he's in a different  hemisphere, but nonetheless... "
19381,josh,"With a healthly dollop of leadership skills... the well-placed, well-worded memo.  Nobody goes off the reservation, everybody does their job. Turn off your computer.  Let's go. "
19383,josh,What is it? 
19385,josh,What's she talking about? 
19387,josh,See you tomorrow. 
19388,josh,What's she talking about? 
19390,josh," ""That's not for me to say. I can tell you that marijuana poses no greater  public health risk than nicotine or alcohol..."" "
19392,josh," ""Yet, bizarrely, to many of us in the health care profession, the law  categorizes it as a Schedule I narcotic while putting a government seal on a pack  of cigarettes."" "
19394,c.j.,Yeah. 
19395,josh, I need you to take a look at this. 
19396,c.j.,What is it? 
19397,josh,"It’s a transcript of an online chat Millicent Griffith just did, page 8. "
19399,josh,I can’t talk to him right now. 
19401,josh,I’m gonna be there in a minute.
19402,c.j.," ""The Allman brothers? "
19403,josh,It gets a lot worse.  
19404,c.j.,"""Marijuana poses no greater public health risk than nicotine or alcohol doesn’t show  the same addictive properties as bizzarely categorized as..."" and I quit! "
19405,josh,Let’s go.
19406,c.j.,Is she kidding me with this? 
19407,josh,Nope. 
19408,c.j.,When did it happen? 
19409,josh,She finished five minutes ago. Talk me through the next twelve hours. 
19410,c.j.,"These people got a story. I guarantee you they called AP already... Carol, get me the  wires."
19411,c.j.,"It’s too late for the Times and the Post, but L.A. and San Francisco will have it. It  will be above the fold, the Today show will lead with it, Russert’s gonna do a segment. "
19412,josh,Toby! 
19413,toby,"Guys, I’m in the Blue Ribbon meeting, I got labor yelling at me, I got a real situation  developing over there."
19414,josh,"Yeah, but there’s a bit of a situation developing here too. "
19415,toby,What’s going on? 
19416,josh,Read that. 
19417,c.j.,Page 8.  Why didn’t you call me? 
19418,josh,While it was happening? 
19419,c.j.,Yes! 
19420,josh,So you cold do what? 
19421,toby,When did it happen? 
19422,josh,She finished about five or ten minutes ago. 
19423,toby,You saw it happen? 
19424,josh,Yeah. 
19425,toby,Why didn’t you get me? 
19426,josh,What were you going to do?
19427,toby,End the interview! 
19428,josh,How? 
19429,toby,By ending it! 
19430,sam,"Listen, something’s happened. "
19431,c.j.,We know. 
19432,sam,How do you know? 
19433,toby,Josh was watching in real time. 
19434,josh,"I’m not gonna belay into the computer screen, Toby. "
19435,sam,What are you talking about? 
19436,toby,"The Surgeon General, what are you talking about? "
19437,sam,Never mind. What did Griffith do? 
19438,toby,She reversed our position on marijuana. 
19439,josh,All right. First things first what time is it in Tokyo? 
19440,toby,They’re fourteen hours ahead. 
19441,josh,I thought it was thirteen. 
19442,toby,Eastern daylight. 
19443,josh,So it’s fourteen hours ahead. 
19444,toby,Yes. 
19445,josh,"Are we sure it’s ahead, and not beind? "
19446,c.j.,"Guys, there are clocks on the wall. "
19447,josh,"Okay, so it’s almost 11 o’clock in Tokyo. "
19448,c.j.,Yeah. 
19449,toby,Ginger! 
19450,toby,Get Larry and Ed. 
19451,c.j.,And anybody else in my office. 
19452,toby,We’ll be in the Roosevelt Room.
19453,josh,"I’m sorry... 11 in the morning, 11 in the afternoon? "
19454,c.j.,It’s 11 A.M. 
19455,sam,The Allman Brothers? 
19456,toby,Keep reading. 
19457,josh,So if it’s not a story until tomorrow morning then they’re not gonna have it until  tomorrow night. So we bought it! 
19458,c.j.,We bought two days. 
19459,toby,How? 
19460,sam,Plane ride. 
19461,josh,When does he leave? 
19462,c.j.,7:00 P.M. Thursday. 
19463,josh,Tomorrow? 
19464,c.j.,Yes. 
19465,josh,Local time? 
19466,c.j.,Which local - theirs or ours? 
19467,toby,It will be 7:00 P.M. Thursday in Japan when he leaves. 
19468,josh,And he lands here when? 
19469,sam,"Okay, the flight is 13 hours long."
19470,c.j., This isn’t happening. 
19471,sam,"He’s going to travel Easward from Tokyo, leaving at 7:00 P.M., so when he crosses the  international dateline..."
19472,toby,He will have traveled back in time to what? 
19473,c.j.,Which puts him down in Washington at 6:00 P.M. Thursday. 
19474,josh,He’s gonna land in Washington an hour before he took off? 
19475,sam,Yeah. 
19476,josh,And that’s not a story that beats the Surgeon General? 
19478,toby," I’m gonna go get yelled at some more. Josh, you need to get Leo. "
19479,josh,Call Tokyo. 
19481,c.j.,Thanks.  
19482,josh,This clock should be in military time. 
19483,sam,"Yeah, ‘cause that’s less confusing. "
19484,josh,The man’s gone a hundred and fifty hours. How can it be Thursday the whole time? 
19485,sam,Listen. Japan is nine hours ahead of Greenwich Mean Time... 
19486,josh,Don’t. 
19488,josh,What were you talking about before? 
19489,sam,"I’ve just been told by someone I believe that a full-page ad had been taken out by the  Family Values Leadership Council that is going to appear in 22 newspapers tomorrow.  It lists many prominent people and it congratulates them for denouncing the movie  ""Prince of New York."""
19490,josh,What’s the problem? 
19491,sam,The President is one of the prominent people they congratulate. 
19492,josh,The President denounced the movie? 
19493,sam,No! 
19494,josh,Then how can they run that ad? 
19495,sam,I have no idea. But I don’t like who we’re being congratulated by. 
19497,josh,"Yeah.  Yeah, Leo, we got a couple of problems here."
19498,sam,I’m here. 
19499,toby,Thanks. 
19500,sam,We’re doing this again? 
19501,toby,Yeah. 
19502,sam,‘Cause I just got you off that little bellman’s thing. 
19503,toby, Here’s my problem. 
19504,toby,"The AARP wants the President to put Seth Gillette on the Commission, so does the AFL-CIO,  it’s important to them and for that reason I think it’s got to be important to us. "
19505,sam,There’s another good reason. 
19506,toby,It neutralizes him. 
19507,sam,He can’t attack the Commission if he’s on it. 
19508,toby,Which is why if we ask he’ll say no. 
19509,sam,"Maybe, maybe not. "
19510,toby,"Yeah, but we can’t risk that. First of all, we need him on the Commission, or else labor  and seniors will be suspicious from the get go; second, if he’s not going to be on the  Commission, it can’t be because he turned us down. "
19511,sam,"So either we get him on the Commission, or if we don’t, we make sure it’s because we  never asked him. "
19512,toby,Yeah.
19513,sam,"Thanks.  Yeah, I don’t know the answer to that. "
19514,toby,"Okay, well. Thanks for stopping by. "
19515,sam,Yeah.
19516,sam,Charlie! 
19517,sam,Can you tell me about that conversation? 
19518,sam,"""Prince of New York."" "
19519,sam,What did you say? 
19520,sam,And you passed? 
19521,sam,"Charlie, was the President involved in that decision at all? "
19522,sam,Okay. 
19523,sam,Yeah. 
19524,josh,"Well, there’d be fallout from women voters and, I’m pretty sure, the AMA, to say nothing  of the First Lady. "
19525,c.j.,Leo? 
19526,josh, I had about nine people on the conference call at several points  of longitude. When’s your first briefing? 
19527,c.j.,An hour. 
19528,josh,You think you're able to show support for the Surgeon General without supporting her  policy? 
19529,c.j.,Yeah. 
19530,josh,Show me. 
19531,c.j.,Try me. 
19532,josh," C.J., did you know that Dr. Griffith was going to criticize  the administration’s drug policy last night? "
19533,c.j.,I don’t agree with your categorization of the comments; I think she expressed her opinion  about the health effects of certain illegal drugs. 
19534,josh,"Well, she basically called for the legalization of marijuana. Does the President agree  with it? "
19535,c.j.,"Wrong again, and I will refer you to the Surgeon General’s comments. When asked if  marijuana should be legalized, she said and I’m quoting, ""It’s not for me to say.""  And she’s right, and it’s important that people understand this. The Surgeon General’s  not a law-maker. She doesn’t set drug policy, the President does, and the President is  100% against legalizing drugs including marijuana. "
19536,josh,Yeah.  
19537,c.j.,Leo wants me to show her support. 
19538,josh,Yeah. 
19539,c.j.,Josh? 
19540,josh,Yeah. 
19541,c.j.,"While I’m showing her support, what are you showing her? "
19542,josh,The door. 
19543,josh,Dr. Griffith. 
19544,josh,Yeah. 
19545,josh,"Well, I've been fine. "
19546,josh,"Yeah, 130 over 87. "
19547,josh,There's a little stiffness. 
19548,josh, When did you see my scar? 
19549,josh,I don't remember. 
19550,josh,There's some pain. 
19551,josh, Along with all manner of things. 
19552,josh,I eat fine. 
19553,josh,I was in great shape in college. 
19554,josh,"Millicent, what were you thinking about? "
19555,josh,"I understand, but your answers... "
19556,josh,Not yet. 
19557,josh,The truth is different if you're a GP or a member of the Stanford Faculty Club than if  you’re the country's chief medical practitioner. 
19558,josh,Did you know that 69% of Americans oppose legalization? Only 23% support it. 
19559,josh,"Well, that's a shock. Did you know that the number gets even higher than that if you  limit the polling sample to Bob Marley and the Whalers? "
19560,josh,Is that what this is about? 
19561,josh,Because the criminal justice system is nowhere near your jurisdiction...
19562,josh,Millicent! 
19563,josh," ""Yet bizarrely the law categorizes it as a schedule one narcotic?!"" "
19564,josh,I've had three conversations with Leo McGarry in the last 12 hours. The reason I've  come here...
19565,josh,"C.J.'s up there right now giving you our support. I'm sorry, but we need you to resign. "
19566,josh,"Dr. Griffith, I say this with all possible respect, but... you serve at the pleasure of  the President. "
19567,josh,"Okay.  Thank you, ma'am. "
19568,josh, Excellent. 
19569,c.j.,Yes. 
19570,c.j.,"No, I don't know what the hell's going on there."
19571,c.j.,Not unless he did it in the shower. But he hasn't denounced it to me and he certainly  hasn't to the public.  That's all. See you this afternoon.
19572,c.j.,Thank you. 
19573,sam,Good job. 
19574,c.j.,Please tell me what's going on with this movie. 
19575,sam,"It's called ""Prince of New York."""
19576,c.j.,Right. 
19577,sam,There's been some controversy about it. 
19578,c.j.,Sex and violence? 
19579,sam,And religious imagery. Family and religious groups are organizing boycotts. 
19580,c.j.,Right. 
19581,sam,"The studio phone banks Charlie because they want a screening, and Charlie passes. "
19582,c.j.,Why? 
19583,sam,Because he did. The producer goes on Imus and says Bartlet's a coward who's siding with  Puritanical censors and that Hollywood should know he's no friend of the First Amendment. 
19584,c.j.,And then the Family Values Leadership Council took out an ad congratulating us for that? 
19585,sam,Yeah. 
19586,c.j.,"Seriously, I quit."
19587,sam,Here's the thing. 
19588,c.j.,Wait. 
19589,sam,We've got these people...
19590,c.j.,Wait. 
19591,sam,We've got the industry people...
19592,c.j.,"""Prince of New York"" is Morgan Ross's movie. "
19593,sam,Yes. But we've got these people...
19594,c.j.,Morgan Ross went on Imus? 
19595,sam,"Well, he did it by phone... "
19596,c.j.,Morgan Ross called the President a coward? 
19597,sam,He didn't call him a coward as much as... 
19598,c.j.,What? 
19599,sam,He called him cowardly. Which is different. 
19600,c.j.,How's it different? 
19601,sam,"It's not, but still... "
19602,c.j.,I'm gonna crush him. 
19603,c.j.,This guy's trying to get a little free media by screwing with us! 
19604,sam,Look. 
19605,c.j.,"I'm the enforcer, Sam. I'm gonna crush him, I'm gonna make him cry, and then I'm gonna  tell his momma about it!"
19606,sam,You're not going to make him cry. 
19607,c.j.,You wanna watch me make him cry?  
19608,sam,"I believe that you can make him cry, I'm saying you're not going to do it. "
19609,c.j.,Sam. 
19610,sam,I'm trying to tell you we're meeting with these people tomorrow. I'll straighten things  out with Morgan Ross. Would you just keep telling the press that you don't know anything? 
19611,c.j., That shouldn't be a problem.
19612,c.j.,Why? 
19613,c.j.,Who made the comment? 
19614,c.j., Carol.
19615,c.j.,Eleanor who?
19616,c.j.," Hey, it's C.J."
19617,toby,"The President's a friend of labor, a friend of seniors, a friend of small animals..."
19618,toby,"We're running out of time, Lenny. We announced this thing at the State of the Union;  we've got to get it going."
19619,toby,Yes. 
19620,toby,Really. 
19621,toby,"Forever? You mean if we never have another recession ever again? Then the fund can  withstand all of 30 years before going bankrupt. Unfortunately, the actuarial tables  say I won't be dead yet.  Guys... Gillette's a tough needle to thread. I want  to know that we have your trust, that whoever we do get will look out for your  interests and that you therefore will support the Commission."
19622,toby,Can I assume from your total silence and blank faces that you're all with me?
19623,toby," Oh, could we?"
19624,c.j.,Josh. 
19625,josh,Listen... 
19626,c.j.,She didn't? 
19627,josh,"No. Leo's gonna need to talk to her. In the meantime, you should start to walk back some  of what you said in the press room, all right? "
19628,c.j.,There's something stickier than the support I gave her in the press room. 
19629,josh,What? 
19630,c.j.,"Danny Concannon's quoting Eleanor Bartlet. She said, ""My father won't fire the Surgeon  General. He would never do that."" "
19631,josh,Eleanor? 
19632,c.j.,Yeah. 
19633,josh,You mean Zoey. 
19634,c.j.,No. It was Eleanor.
19635,bartlet,They're trying to export their way out of their own economic problems. 
19636,bartlet,"And by dumping low priced steel on the U.S., you know what they're asking for? "
19637,bartlet,"They're begging for a protectionist response. Steel and mining employ a hundred and  seventy thousand workers. They're not going to sit around while discount steel comes  flying into... how you doing?   They're going to want retaliatory tariffs, and you know what that means? "
19638,bartlet,A return to Smoot-Hawley and the Great Depression. 
19639,leo,Charlie! 
19640,bartlet,"Leo, I'm walking over to the press and telling them that retaliatory tariffs are gonna  cost American taxpayers 800,000 dollars for every job saved. "
19641,leo,We're not taking questions. Let's get in the car. 
19642,bartlet,What's going on? 
19643,leo,Eleanor made a comment on the record and you can't answer questions right now. 
19644,bartlet,Eleanor? 
19645,leo,Yeah. 
19646,bartlet,You mean Zoey. 
19647,leo,It was Eleanor. 
19648,bartlet,When did this happen? 
19649,leo,About six hours ago. 
19650,bartlet,Why didn't you tell me six hours ago? 
19651,leo, Because I didn't want you crash-landing the plane. Let's get in the car.
19653,josh,No. 
19655,josh,That's not a reason to make it legal.
19657,josh,"Donna, parents are keeping kids away from drugs with a whip and a chair. It doesn't help  them out if we... "
19659,josh,"No, that's okay, it's just me, talking... "
19661,josh,Does he want to see me? 
19663,c.j.,"Welcome back, Mr. President. "
19664,bartlet,"Thank you.  I've had it, C.J. I've absolutely had it! "
19665,c.j.,Sir... 
19666,bartlet,What the hell is Danny Concannon doing calling my kids? 
19667,c.j.,Mr. President... 
19668,bartlet,He knows better than that! They all know better than that! But Danny... 
19669,c.j.,"Sir, he didn't... "
19670,bartlet,"C.J., you're going to suspend his credentials for six months, and I don't give a damn.  His paper wants to cover the President, they can send someone else. "
19671,c.j.,"Mr. President, Danny didn't call her. "
19672,bartlet,I was told it was Danny. 
19673,c.j.,"Yes, sir. She called him. "
19674,bartlet, She called him?
19675,josh,"Good evening, welcome back Mr. President. "
19676,bartlet,"The Allman Brothers, Josh? "
19677,josh,"How was the flight, sir? "
19678,bartlet,"Tokyo is willing to show economic restraint, in exchange for a good fielding shortstop  and a left-handed reliever... Who's against us so far? "
19679,josh,"The Judiciary Committee, Government Reform and Oversight, Appropriations... "
19680,bartlet,Why Appropriations? 
19681,josh,They control the Surgeon General's budget. 
19682,bartlet,Who's coming to her defense? 
19683,josh,"The Cannabis Society, The Cannabis Coalition, E Cannabis Unum, The American Hemp League,  and Friends of Mary Jane."
19684,bartlet,Yeah? 
19685,bartlet,"Yes, I understand I've been congratulated for denouncing a movie I've never heard of. "
19686,c.j.,"Yes, sir. "
19687,bartlet,I've got to hand it to you guys you've pulled off a political first. You've managed to win  me the support of the Christian Right and the Cheech and Chong Fan Club in the same day. 
19688,josh,Leo's seeing her tomorrow. 
19689,bartlet,Anything else? 
19690,josh,"No, sir. "
19691,bartlet,Thank you. 
19692,c.j.,"Thank you, Mr. President. "
19693,josh,"Thank you, Mr. President. "
19694,bartlet,Charlie? Would you arrange for my middle daughter to come see me at her earliest possible  convenience? 
19695,bartlet,"Ah, screw her convenience. Get her ass down here."
19696,sam,Yeah? 
19697,toby,What's this note? 
19698,sam,That note? 
19699,toby,Yeah. 
19700,sam,It says that we should stand by the Surgeon General. 
19701,toby,"Actually, it says that we should stand by the Sturgeon General. "
19702,sam,Does it? 
19703,toby,Yeah. 
19704,sam,I meant Surgeon General. 
19705,toby,"Well, I think we should stand by her too. I just wanted to make sure we were agreed that  smoked white fish was pretty much on its own. "
19706,sam,Yeah. 
19707,toby,She's here? 
19708,toby,You're with the ratings people? 
19709,sam,Soon. What's the food for? 
19710,toby,Today's attempt at ensuring our future. 
19711,sam,What's your plan? 
19712,toby,The first thing I have to do is be nice to a liberal Democratic Congresswoman. 
19713,sam,Will that be hard? 
19714,toby,"Well, it was when I was married to her. "
19715,toby,Good to see you. Thanks for coming. You look fantastic. 
19716,toby,Sam's great. 
19717,sam,"Fit as a fiddle, Andy. Although, to tell you the truth, I found... "
19718,toby,Nobody cares. 
19719,sam,Yeah.  
19720,toby,Hi. 
19721,toby,Congresswoman Wyatt. 
19722,toby,You're growing into that title very nicely. 
19723,toby,Heh. Yeah. Labor wants Gillette on the Commission. 
19724,toby,So does the AARP. 
19725,toby,It's very important to them. 
19726,toby,Do you know why? 
19727,toby,We're one of their people. 
19728,toby,"No. But I bring you here, and we sit, and we have coffee, and we have Danish, in the hope  that calmer and, dare I say, prettier heads prevail."
19729,toby,I was referring to myself. 
19730,toby,Nope. 
19731,toby,"Right. This is really important, Andy. Can you help us? "
19732,toby,Close the door. 
19733,toby,Put the Danish down.
19734,leo,Dr. Griffith. 
19735,leo,"Congratulations, Millie. You're now the pamphlet girl for every right wing fundraising  cause. That interview's got to be worth at least 20, 30 million bucks in contributions  from people who think you're going to distribute dime bags of Hawaiian sens at junior  high schools along with condoms and fornication manuals. "
19736,leo,You think this is funny? 
19737,leo,That's not your... 
19738,leo,"Six different committee chairs... three in the House, three in the Senate... are all  talking about hearings. "
19739,leo,"They don't need to find anything. They just need to say your name and ""drugs"" as many  times as possible on television. I don't think you said anything wrong. Nobody with a  brain thinks you did anything wrong. And I'd like to do the right thing all the time,  but I can't. I can't let us get bogged down in this crap. Government will stop, this  will be what we do for two months, and there are more important things than that. I'll  take the heat from the First Lady, but I want your resignation by eight o'clock tonight  or the President's gonna fire you. I've got a meeting. "
19740,bartlet,"...in consumer costs per job saved. Retaliatory tariffs on steel imports are a disaster.  Anyone wants to check my math, they're more than welcome to. "
19741,bartlet,"Anybody wants to shove the Golden Gate Bridge up Japan's ass, they're more than welcome  to do that too. "
19742,bartlet,Oh...  Thank you. 
19743,bartlet,"Ellie, thanks for coming. "
19744,bartlet,Come on in. 
19745,bartlet,Did you get down here okay? 
19746,bartlet,Did you take an airplane? 
19747,bartlet,A helicopter? 
19748,bartlet,"That's because you go to school at Johns Hopkins, right? "
19749,bartlet,"And Johns Hopkins is in Baltimore. I'm asking 'cause Baltimore is a 45-minute car ride  from Washington, D.C. and we hardly see you anymore. So, I thought either you transfered  to a different medical school, they moved Johns Hopkins, or they moved Baltimore.  Are any of those things true? "
19750,bartlet,"Okay. And this is accurate, right? This quote. ""My father won't fire the Surgeon General.  He would never do that."" "
19751,bartlet,"Eleanor, when you put your head down, your hair falls in your face, and I can't see your  face, and I can't hear what you're saying. Now look at me, and talk to me!"
19752,bartlet,What the hell are you doing talking to a reporter? 
19753,bartlet," Well, I'm sure  before you gave the quote you cleared it with the Communications Office. I'm sure you  went over the exact wording with C.J. Cregg and coordinated with White House strategy  so that the timing was right in the news cycle. I'm certain you consulted the appropriate  party leadership because you're a pretty knowledgeable operative having spent so much  time with me. Ellie? "
19754,bartlet,What? 
19755,bartlet,Pick your head up! 
19756,bartlet,"There is politics involved in this, Ellie. And you knew it would make me unhappy and  that's why you did it and that's cheap. "
19757,bartlet,"Well, you sure didn't do it to make me happy! "
19758,bartlet,"Okay, let's drop it. "
19759,bartlet,"Mom gets back first thing in the morning, and we're running a movie tonight if you want  to stay over. "
19760,bartlet,"Yeah, thanks."
19761,bartlet,That door over there. 
19762,bartlet,Yeah. 
19763,bartlet,"Send him in.  Charlie... Give me just a minute, would you? "
19764,toby,Andy...
19765,toby,Look. 
19766,toby,"No, I will not hang on. "
19767,toby,"Sad to say, Andrea, there aren’t a whole lot of members of the liberal wing of the  Democratic Party.  "
19768,toby,"Hey, Andy, people are living decades longer than anyone at this rate in 1935! "
19769,toby,"We want to consider everything, but we can’t consider anything, unless... "
19770,toby,"Because it’s the only way it’s gonna happen! Because you can’t solve Social Security and  ask people to run for election at the same time! So why not give politicians some cloud  cover and let them be lawmakers for a while? Fifteen people in a room with the door  closed; seven democrats, seven republicans, and the President of the United States, who  will not have a vote, and they walk out of that room, and with one voice they make a  recommendation to Congress and the American people! And nobody knows who was where!   "
19771,toby,"Listen, I read in the paper that I’m on the benefit committee for the Child Leukemia  Foundation. "
19772,toby,Why do you suppose the paper wrote that? 
19773,toby,I guess they must have. You don’t think it’d be a better idea if you asked me first? 
19774,toby,Interesting. 
19775,toby,Skip over the first step and move right to the second. 
19776,c.j.," Toby... Hey, Andy! "
19777,c.j.," Toby, when you have a minute, can you stop by the office, and... "
19778,c.j.,What? 
19779,toby,"C.J., tomorrow morning I want you to announce that Seth Gillette’s joined the Blue Ribbon  Commission on Social Security. "
19780,c.j.,Toby... 
19781,toby,"Make sure the press knows the Senator put the Democratic Party above personal differences,  and that he put people above all. Make sure they know that he’s a patriot, and when the  President asked him to serve, Senator Gillette answered the call. "
19782,c.j.,Did he? 
19783,toby,Yeah. I just saw it at your press briefing tomorrow morning. 
19784,c.j.,"Okay, but this is really the last thing I’m doing before I quit. "
19785,toby, Okay. 
19786,sam,Can I talk to you? 
19787,sam,Come on. 
19788,sam,I don’t care. 
19789,sam,"‘Cause, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the AMA and the American Psychological  association all say that watching violence on T.V. is bad for kids and we’re gonna listen  to the experts. "
19790,sam,Remember it whenever you’d like. 
19791,sam,"""Dial M for murder."" "
19792,sam,"Yeah. Morgan, the President’s never seen your movie, he’s never heard of your movie,  he has no particular objection to your movie, and you know it. "
19793,sam,"Gloriosky, Morgan, the Family Values Leadership Council distorted the truth. Stop the  presses. "
19794,sam,"I’ve read the press synopsis of the film, and if the exhibitors put you on every screen  of every multiplex in every mall you still wouldn’t do any business in Mississippi,  Oklahoma or Alabama. "
19795,sam,"No, but you are. Which explains a lot to me about Hollywood. And you know the ad was  going to get you more business than you lost and that’s why you went on Imus and said  what you did. "
19796,sam,"Yeah. Because it makes me crazy, Morgan, this is exactly the kind of thing that should  be celebrated by First Amendment advocates. Charlie was offered a choice and he made one.  Why aren’t you standing up, saying, ""See, it works! You don’t need to ban movies like  ""Prince of New York"", you just have to choose not to watch them!"" And Morgan you ever  call the President a coward again for your own PR purposes, it’s not going to be C.J.  Cregg you gotta deal with, it’s going to be me. You understand what I’m saying, right? "
19797,sam,Now why don’t you go back to your meeting and show me how much you want to make it up  to us.
19798,toby,Good job.
19799,josh, This isn’t good. 
19801,josh,The President’s not talking. 
19803,josh,He usually talks during the movie.
19804,bartlet,Good evening. 
19805,bartlet,I’m sorry about this. 
19806,bartlet,Is that your resignation? 
19807,bartlet,Thank you. 
19808,bartlet,Did you not think that playing down the dangers of drug use sent a dangerous signal  as well? 
19809,bartlet,"Millie, did you put her up to it? "
19810,bartlet,"""My father won’t fire the Surgeon General, he would never do that."" You didn’t put her  up to it? "
19811,bartlet,"You didn’t pick up the phone after Josh came to see you and say, ""Ellie, it’s your  godmother, let’s stick it to your old man, and paint him into a corner?"" "
19812,bartlet, Why haven’t I ever been able to get her to like me? I’m asking you. 
19813,bartlet,I’m asking you. 
19814,bartlet,I’m not. 
19815,bartlet,She’s mad at me. 
19816,bartlet,"Yes, I am! "
19817,bartlet,"I was running for President, where the hell was she? "
19818,bartlet,Not like Zoey and Liz. 
19819,bartlet,She’s always belonged to Abbey. 
19820,bartlet,"No, I didn’t! "
19821,bartlet,How did I frighten her? 
19822,bartlet,"I was elected two years ago, she’s 24 years old! "
19823,bartlet,It never seemed to intimidate Zoey or Liz. 
19824,bartlet,That’s not true. 
19825,bartlet,That’s not true. 
19826,bartlet,"No, no, no. I will bear with the nonsense of the Christian right and the Hollywood  left and the AFL-CIO and the AARP and the Canubus society and Japan, but I will not  stand and allow someone to tell me that I love one of my children less than the others.   She’s frightened of me? "
19827,bartlet,"I wanted to be so mad at her. I heard the news and my first thought was... My god,  ""King Lear"" is a good play.  ""My father won’t fire the Surgeon General, he would  never do that."" I wanted to be so mad at her. But the truth is, it’s the nicest thing  she’s ever said about me. "
19828,bartlet,Good night. 
19829,bartlet,"Hey, doc! "
19830,bartlet,I don’t accept. 
19831,bartlet,I don’t accept your resignation. 
19832,bartlet,These are the bigger things. I don’t accept your resignation.   You work for me. You go when I tell you to. 
19833,bartlet," Yes, I know. "
19834,bartlet," Yes, indeed. "
19835,bartlet,"Tell C.J. when she gives Millie our support on Monday, she can mean it. "
19836,josh," You know, it’s going to seem to some people like you did it ‘cause your  daughter asked you to. "
19837,bartlet,"You know, Josh, I think if you ever have a daughter, you’re going to discover there  are worse reasons in the world to do something. Sit down, we’re coming to the good part. "
19838,bartlet, How you doing? 
19839,bartlet,"I said, how you doing? "
19840,bartlet,"You know, we’re coming up to the good part. "
19841,bartlet,You want to bet me your tuition no one in this room is going to shush me? 
19842,bartlet,I hear you’re thinking about ophthalmology. 
19843,bartlet, Why would you want to study people’s feet? 
19844,bartlet,Then what’s children’s medicine?
19845,bartlet,I thought it was obstetrics. 
19846,bartlet,And what’s the study of feet? 
19847,bartlet,Hmmm?  The only thing you ever had to do to make me  happy was come home at the end of the day. 
19848,bartlet,"So, endocrinology would be what? Disorders of the gallbladder? "
19849,bartlet,"I’m pretty sure you’re wrong about that, I think endocrinology is your sub-specialty  of internal medicine, devoted to the digestive system. "
19850,bartlet,"Are you sure it’s not nephrology, immunology, cardiology, or dermatology? "
19851,bartlet,Okay. Here comes the good part.
19852,leo,Sam?
19853,sam,What day is this? 
19854,leo,It’s Friday. 
19855,sam,I’m sorry. I meant... I’m sorry. What time is it? 
19856,leo,You sleep here last night? 
19857,sam,I’m sorry? 
19858,leo,You slept here? 
19859,sam,I don’t have a couch in my office. 
19860,leo,"Yeah, but you have a bed in your house, right? "
19861,sam,I need to change my shirt. 
19862,leo,Maybe you need to go home for a while. 
19863,sam,What are you doing here so early? 
19864,leo,Trying to avoid the protesters. Metro police closed a four-block radius around the World  Bank and made Pennsylvania Avenue one way from M to 21st. 
19865,leo,Seventeenth and 15th are closed to Independence Avenue and Constitution’s closed between  23rd and the Ellipse. 
19866,sam,Did you take Dupont? 
19867,leo,"Dupont had two turns closed off with metal barricades and cop cars. So, I took P to Logan  Circle, which was also blocked. So, I made a U-turn and doubled back to get on 16th, where  there was a police cordon around the National Geographic Society. "
19868,sam,Who has a problem with the National Geographic Society? 
19869,leo,That’s exactly what I want to know. 
19870,sam,"Anyway, I’m going to change my shirt. "
19871,leo,What’s going on with the pardon recommendations? 
19872,sam,They’re coming together. I’ve reviewed the recommendations from Justice and the OPA and  Tribbey’s office had its own recommendations. 
19873,leo,How many are you sending in? 
19874,sam,"Eighteen, I think, now. Mail fraud, securities fraud, and truly the most bogus drug bust  I’ve ever seen. "
19875,leo,Don’t retry the cases. 
19876,sam,I’m not retrying the cases. I’m reading the material I’m supposed to read. I’m making the  recommendations I’m supposed to make. The guy was tried in Spain and found guilty of a  crime he was obviously too stupid to commit. 
19877,leo,"Sam, go home, would you? "
19878,sam,"No, I’m just going to change my shirt. "
19879,leo,"You look bad. You’re tired, you slept in the office. It’s Friday. Go home. "
19880,sam,Why? 
19881,leo,‘Cause I think you’re putting too much faith in the magical powers of a new shirt. 
19882,sam,Leo. 
19883,leo,Josh told me what happened... with your parents. Sam... 
19884,sam,Yeah? 
19885,leo,My father had affairs. 
19886,sam,Did he? 
19887,leo,Yeah. 
19888,sam,"My father didn’t pick up a cocktail waitress, Leo. He’s had a woman in an apartment in  Santa Monica... "
19889,leo,Yeah? 
19890,sam,...for 28 years. 
19891,leo,How’d he get caught? 
19892,sam,"My father, it turns out, is stupider than the guy in Spain. So, the real question is how  did he not get caught until now? "
19893,leo,Yeah. 
19894,sam,"Anyway, I’ll see you at the staff meeting later. "
19895,leo, Sam. 
19896,sam,Yeah? 
19897,leo,When did you find out? 
19898,sam,Tuesday. 
19899,leo,You slept here the last three nights? 
19900,sam,No. 
19901,leo,"Seriously, man, go home. "
19902,sam,"No, I’m going to check the final OPA list. In fact, I’ll be checking it twice...  see who’s been naughty, see who’s been nice. "
19903,leo,Sam. 
19904,sam,"Life goes on, Leo. Certainly the Federal Government does, so... Thanks, but let’s drop  it, okay? "
19905,leo,Yeah. 
19906,sam,They’re expecting trouble at the National Geographic Society? 
19907,leo,I have no explanation. 
19908,sam,"Well, those little postcards they stick in the subscription magazines drive me out of  my mind, so, maybe... "
19909,leo,Yeah. 
19910,sam,I’ll see you later.
19911,josh,Yeah. 
19912,leo,It is a good speech. 
19913,josh,And it gets better every year. But... 
19914,leo,What? 
19915,josh,"You’re not going to give it, right? "
19916,leo,Sure. 
19917,josh,Why? 
19918,leo,"Because it’s Big Block of Cheese Day, Josh. "
19919,josh,"Yeah, see, but we know it’s Big Block of Cheese Day. And we know why it’s called Big  Block of Cheese Day. So, there’s really no need for the speech. "
19920,leo,"Except it wouldn’t be Big Block of Cheese Day without the speech, now, would it? "
19921,josh,"Well, let’s find out. Maybe it would. "
19922,leo,How did you get to work this morning? 
19923,josh,I walked. 
19924,leo,Ah. 
19925,josh,Yeah. 
19926,leo,How is it out there? 
19927,josh,"Uh, it’s pretty loud. "
19928,leo,World Policy Studies is holding a forum this morning. I’m going to send Toby. 
19929,josh,That’s a good idea. 
19930,leo,Why? 
19931,josh,"Well, ‘cause you’re not sending me. "
19932,leo,"Look, I... "
19933,josh,"Leo, the World Bank and the WTO are international organizations of which the U.S. is one  member. Why isn’t Switzerland the one? "
19934,leo,"‘Cause they’re not protesting in Switzerland... they’re protesting on 18th Street, and  I don’t want to be asked how come no one from the White House ever met with them. "
19935,josh,"Well, that seems reasonable. "
19936,leo,I can’t tell you how relieved I am to have your approval on that. 
19937,josh,But you’re still going to do the speech. 
19938,leo,"Got to. Little thing called team morale, Josh. You gotta make people feel good about  themselves."
19939,leo,"All right, shut the hell up, everybody. I’ve fired more people than you before breakfast."
19940,leo,"Andrew Jackson,...  ...in the main foyer of the White House had a big  block of cheese. The block of cheese was huge... "
19941,c.j.,"Leo, who made these assignments? "
19942,leo,"I think this will go faster if I’m not interrupted, don’t you? "
19943,c.j.,I’m meeting with the Organization of Cartographers for Social Equality? 
19944,c.j.,What do mapmakers have to do with social equality? 
19945,leo,I guess you’re about to find out. 
19946,c.j.,"Well, probably not, because I won’t really be listening to them. "
19947,leo,The block of cheese was huge...
19949,leo,You’re all keeping it. I’m sure Margaret worked long and hard to make sure that the  appropriate petitioner went to the appropriate staffer. 
19950,leo,"The block of cheese was two tons, and was there for any and all who might be hungry... "
19951,toby, Excuse me. I was waylaid. 
19952,c.j.,By what? 
19953,toby,"30,000 tourists. "
19954,toby,"No, don’t call them protesters, I’ve seen better organized crowds at the DMV. "
19955,leo,Two tons this block of cheese weighed...
19956,toby," In my day, we knew how to protest. "
19957,c.j.,What day was that? 
19958,toby,1968. 
19959,josh,How the hell old were you when you were protesting? 
19960,toby,My sisters took me.  Anybody have a problem with that? 
19961,leo,No one has a problem with that. 
19962,toby,The police are always seven steps ahead of them. The cops know exactly where they’re  going to be and what’s going to happen. You know how they know? By logging onto their  website. We had the underground. We had rapid response. 
19963,c.j.,"And by God, you were home by supper on a school night. "
19964,toby,These people are amateurs. What’s my assignment? 
19965,leo,Meeting with the amateurs. 
19966,toby,Huh? 
19967,leo,World Policy Studies is having a forum... there’ll be about a hundred of them. 
19968,toby,Doing what? 
19969,leo,Listening to you conduct a free exchange of ideas. 
19970,toby,Really? 
19971,leo,Josh thinks it’s a good idea. 
19972,toby,"Oh well, if Josh thinks it’s a good idea, then you bet, I’ll do it. "
19973,leo,Look... 
19974,toby,What else is there? 
19975,c.j.,I’ve got Cartographers for Social Equality. 
19976,josh,"So, now you have two choices... meeting with an unruly mob or meeting with lunatic  mapmakers. "
19977,toby,Or getting paid a lot more money working almost anywhere else I want. 
19978,leo,"Seriously, Toby, there’ll be security there. But still... "
19979,toby,What about press? 
19980,c.j.,Just wires. 
19981,toby,"No, I mean T.V. "
19982,c.j.,No cameras.
19983,toby,You negotiated that? 
19984,c.j.,Yeah. 
19985,toby,They agreed to it? 
19986,c.j.,"You want to make out with me right now, don’t you? "
19987,toby,"Well, when don’t I?  Give me the thing. "
19988,leo,"Okay, then. Andrew Jackson in the main foyer of the White House had a two-ton block  of cheese. "
19989,josh,And a wheat thin the size of Lake Tahoe. 
19990,leo,"It was there for any and all who were hungry. It was there for the voiceless, the faceless... "
20009,bartlet,I don’t really need to see the ten-year numbers.
20010,bartlet,Have the ten-year projections ever been close to accurate?
20011,bartlet,Within a trillion dollars.
20012,bartlet,"Okay. Bring me the ten-year projection, a Ouija board and a magic wand."
20013,bartlet,What’s next? 
20014,bartlet,From whom? 
20015,bartlet,That name sounds familiar. 
20016,bartlet,Yes. I remember being locked in a steamer trunk. 
20017,bartlet,"There were actual steamers in there with me, Charlie. I was in there with seafood. "
20018,bartlet,We lost the site. 
20019,bartlet,Why? 
20020,bartlet,Which says? 
20021,bartlet,"What plaid flannel-wearing, cheese-eating, yahoo of a milkman governor signed that idiot  bill into state law?  It was me, wasn’t it? "
20022,bartlet,Okay. 
20023,bartlet,"Yeah, go ahead. "
20024,bartlet,No. 
20025,bartlet,"No, don’t go ahead with the site. I just...  Tell my brother to hang on, would you?  I’ll make a decision. I don’t know what the damn hurry is. "
20026,sam,"Bonnie, I now need the ten-year OMB projections, as well."
20027,sam,No.
20028,sam,Thanks. 
20030,sam,"Oh, hey. How you doing? "
20032,sam,Come on in. 
20034,sam,What are you doing in town? 
20035,sam,What can I do for you? 
20036,sam,Really? 
20037,sam, You know who Daniel Gault was? 
20039,sam,He was a Special Economic Assistant to FDR and Special Liaison to State for Eastern  European Affairs. 
20041,sam,He wasn’t put in jail for espionage. They couldn’t make espionage. He was put in jail for  perjury for lying in front of HUAC. 
20043,sam,Yeah.  It’s impossible to demonstrate remorse since he’s no longer alive.  Demonstrating his innocence is extremely complicated. 
20044,sam,Excuse me? 
20045,sam,When did I do that? 
20046,sam,Where did you get that? 
20047,sam,I did. 
20048,sam,Your father’s sick? 
20049,sam,You guys want to go to the mess and get some coffee or something? 
20051,toby,Toby Ziegler.
20052,toby,"Yes, ma’am. "
20053,toby,You fully trained? 
20054,toby,How many different ways you know how to kill a man? 
20055,toby,I like you. 
20056,toby,Officer Sachs? 
20057,toby,It’s going to be a day at the beach. 
20058,sam,You do understand how it works? 
20059,sam,"Recommendations come from the OPA... Office of the Pardon Attorney. Then the President  gets into it, and more often than not, sends it to Counsel’s office for a further review.  So... it can be a bit of a drawn-out process. "
20060,sam,What I’m going to do today is speak to somebody at the Justice Department. 
20061,sam,The FBI. 
20062,sam,"I know, but I won’t start in on something like this without giving them a heads-up. "
20063,sam,"National Defense and Foreign Relations Information, Internal Agency Rules and Practices,  and Personal Privacy. "
20064,sam,"I know, and that’s why I have to give them a heads-up. Does Donna know how to get in touch  with you later? I’d like to tell you how it’s going. We have your number at the hotel? "
20066,sam,"Stephanie, the reason I mentioned before that it could be a drawn-out process... "
20067,sam,"Yeah. Okay, I’ll see you later then. "
20068,josh,"Hey, Steph. "
20070,josh,Yeah. 
20071,sam, I’m walking out with you. 
20072,sam,Yeah.
20073,josh,You on the Gault thing? 
20074,sam,Yeah. 
20075,josh,That’s nice of you. I appreciate that. 
20076,sam,Yeah. I’ll give the Bureau a heads-up. 
20077,josh,They’re not going to be happy about it. 
20078,sam,No kidding. 
20079,josh,Did you know that Lincoln signed a pardon on the day he was assassinated? 
20080,sam,Yeah. 
20081,josh,You know the guy’s name? 
20082,sam,Patrick Murphy. 
20083,josh,You know what he was pardoned for? 
20084,sam,Being a Union deserter. 
20085,josh,Am I annoying you? 
20086,sam,"A little bit, yeah. "
20087,josh,I was trying to make you laugh. 
20088,sam,I appreciate that. Can I see your friend at the FBI? 
20089,josh,Yeah. Can I tell him why? 
20090,sam,Yeah. 
20091,josh,"Hey, you want to have a lot of fun? Seriously. Sit in on C.J.’s meeting with the  Organization of Cartographers for Social Equality. "
20092,sam,Where’s the social inequality in cartography? 
20093,josh,I don’t know. That’s why I’m going. 
20094,sam,You’ll call the guy? 
20095,josh,Yeah. 
20096,sam,Thanks. 
20097,josh,That a new shirt? 
20098,sam,Yeah. 
20099,josh,Nice.
20100,toby,Fire your gun. 
20101,toby,"No, I mean fire at them.  Just kidding. "
20102,toby," Hey, Solzhenitsyn. Come here. You’re the group leader?"
20103,toby,"You know what you did today that was really stupid? You gave away the cameras. With  cameras in here I’ve got a problem ‘cause I don’t want to look like I can’t control  the crowd. Without the cameras, I can sit here, read the sports section for two hours,  walk outside and say we talked. So, if you guys want to talk, that’s fine. But you’re  in charge of crowd control, know what I’m saying?"
20104,toby,"Good morning...  Good morning, my name is Toby  Ziegler and I’m the White House Communications Director and a senior domestic policy  advisor to the President."
20105,toby, You want to send out for pizza or something? 
20106,sam,I’m here to see Special Agent Casper. My name is Sam Seaborn. 
20107,sam,Yeah. 
20108,sam,"How are you doing, Mike? "
20109,sam,I came here to... 
20110,sam,"Mike, you guys got it wrong and you know it. "
20111,sam,Yes.
20112,sam,"Michael, I gave you the heads-up as a courtesy. I don’t need your permission to go to  the OPA. I don’t need your permission to tell the press why I did. "
20113,sam,He did six months for perjury before vexingly dying of a heart attack. 
20114,sam,‘Cause the prosecutor couldn’t make espionage. 
20115,sam,"Well, why do you suppose that was? "
20116,sam,Twelve jurors say no and you’re still... 
20117,sam,"The ""20 Years of Treason""."
20118,sam,"Somebody, wake me up from this ‘cause I think you just deputized Joe McCarthy into your  argument. "
20119,sam,You know who else was on that list? 
20120,sam,"General George Marshall, author of the Marshall Plan and mentor to Eisenhower. Course that  was after he won World War II. "
20121,sam,"Owen Lattimore, I.F. Stone. "
20122,sam,"You guys rounded up some pretty dangerous TV comedy writers, too. "
20123,sam,Ring Larder's just died. How many years does he get back? 
20124,sam,"Please, God, Mike. Please tell me you weren’t just threatening Toby Ziegler. "
20125,sam,Good. 
20126,sam,"Anyway... ""Because the Bureau will be embarrassed"" isn’t a good enough reason. I’m putting  Daniel Gault on the list. I just wanted to give you a heads-up. "
20127,sam,Nope. 
20128,c.j.,Hi. I’m sorry. 
20129,c.j.,I’m sorry to be late. 
20130,c.j.,I’m C.J. Cregg. 
20131,c.j.,Huke? 
20132,c.j.,Okay. And you are the Organization of Cartographers for Social Equality. 
20133,c.j.,How many? 
20134,c.j.,What are the dues? 
20135,c.j.,Let’s start. 
20136,josh,"Wait. Wait, I want to see this. "
20137,c.j.,This is Josh Lyman. 
20138,c.j.,"Josh, this is Dr. Fallow... "
20139,josh,Hi. 
20140,c.j.,...and his merry men. 
20141,c.j.,Should we begin? 
20142,josh,Give me 200 bucks and it’s done. 
20143,c.j.,No. Why are we changing maps? 
20144,c.j.,Really? 
20145,c.j.,Yes? 
20146,c.j.,Are you saying the map is wrong? 
20147,c.j.,Okay... 
20148,c.j.,Okay... 
20149,c.j.,Yes. 
20150,c.j.,Yes. 
20151,josh,"Wait, wait. Relative size is one thing, but you’re telling me that Germany isn’t where we  think it is? "
20152,c.j.,Where is it? 
20153,c.j.,What the hell is that? 
20154,josh,Uh-huh. 
20155,toby,"Well, it’s not like being at a Yankee game. "
20156,toby,"Well, actually...  Yeah, it’s like being at a Yankee game. "
20157,toby,Officer? 
20158,toby,"It’s about the WTO, Rhonda, the World Trade Organization. "
20159,toby,The World Trade Organization’s a group of 140 countries who have agreed to specific trade  policies. 
20160,toby,Nothing’s wrong with that. 
20161,toby,They’d say the WTO benefits corporations and not people. 
20162,toby,Benefits both.  Look at them. 
20163,toby,Philistines. 
20164,toby,"Yeah, make all the jokes you want but let me tell you something they claim to speak for  the underprivileged but here in the blackest city in America, I’m looking at a room with  no black faces. No Asians, No Hispanics. Where the hell’s the Third World they claim to  represent? "
20165,toby,You’re starting to bother me. 
20166,toby,"No, I like that.  I’m going outside. "
20167,sam,"Hey, Charlie, what’s going on? "
20168,sam,What happened? 
20169,sam,They’ll find another site. 
20170,sam,"They shouldn’t be talking to him now about the library, anyway. We’re not going anywhere  for a few years, right? "
20171,sam,Yeah. 
20172,sam,"Ginger, do me a favor and catch the calls. I’m going to lie down in Toby’s office for a  few minutes. "
20173,sam,Good. 
20174,sam,Nancy... 
20175,sam,Why? 
20176,sam,"Nancy, I’m a lawyer. Let’s let reason and logic have its moment. There was one witness. "
20177,sam,"Earl Lydecker, a low level State Department staffer who confessed to FBI counterintelligence  officers that he and Gault had conspired to send U.S. economic analysis documents to Soviet  agents at the Russian embassy. "
20178,sam,"He confessed, by the way, for no particular reason. "
20179,sam,It was subsequently demonstrated that Lydecker was a clinically diagnosed manic-depressive  with a history of... wait for it... institutionalization. This was the chief witness for  the prosecution. According to... 
20180,sam,"Excuse me, please. According to retired KGB Colonel Oleg Prosorov a search of the files  at Lubyanka reveals only one reference to Gault. That he was approached in 1943 and  labeled ""highly uncooperative"" and a ""poor prospect for recruitment"". "
20181,sam, Oh my God... 
20182,sam,Based on what? 
20183,sam,"If that was the case, why couldn’t the U.S. Attorney make espionage in the 1950s? "
20184,sam,You’re telling me that we cracked some obscure Russian code and suddenly we learned Gault  was a spy? 
20185,sam,That’s crap. If the FBI had proof on Gault they would have told the world about it. 
20186,sam,Nancy... 
20187,sam,"Yeah, well, I’ll believe that when they show me the file. "
20188,sam,That’s not an FBI file. 
20189,sam,"Nancy, I’m classified but I don’t have code word clearance. "
20190,sam,I’m saying I’m not allowed to see that and you could get into trouble for showing it to me. 
20191,sam, Of course. 
20192,c.j.,No. I’m wondering where France really is. 
20193,josh,"Guys, we want to thank you very much for coming in... "
20194,c.j.,Hang on. We’re going to finish this. 
20195,josh,Okay.
20196,josh,She asked.
20197,josh,I’m going to check in on Toby. 
20198,c.j.,Go. 
20199,josh," These guys find Brigadoon on that map you’ll call me, right? "
20200,c.j.,Probably not. 
20201,josh,Okay.  
20202,c.j.,But... wait. How... Where else could you put the Northern Hemisphere but on the top? 
20203,c.j.,How? 
20204,c.j.,"Yeah, but you can’t do that. "
20205,c.j.,‘Cause it’s freaking me out. 
20206,toby,"It’s activist vacation is what it is. Spring break for anarchist wannabes. The black  t-shirts, the gas masks as fashion accessories. "
20207,toby,"All right, that’s it, flatfoot. "
20208,toby,You want the benefits of free trade? Food is cheaper. 
20209,toby,"Food is cheaper, clothes are cheaper, steel is cheaper, cars are cheaper, phone service  is cheaper. You feel me building a rhythm here? That’s ‘cause I’m a speechwriter and I  know how to make a point. "
20210,toby,"It lowers prices, it raises income. You see what I did with ‘lowers’ and ‘raises’ there? "
20211,toby,"It’s called the science of listener attention. We did repetition, we did floating opposites  and now you end with the one that’s not like the others. Ready? Free trade stops wars. And  that’s it. Free trade stops wars! And we figure out a way to fix the rest! One world, one  peace. I’m sure I’ve seen that on a sign somewhere. "
20212,toby,Shut up. 
20213,josh,Toby... 
20214,toby,What are you doing here? 
20215,josh,Came down to see how it was going.  How’s it going? Josh Lyman. 
20216,josh,Any trouble? 
20217,toby," Josh. The WTO is undemocratic, and accountable to no one, decisions  are made by Executive Directors and the developing world has little to say about  institutional policy. "
20218,josh,What was that? 
20219,toby,I protested to you. 
20220,josh,Why? 
20221,toby,‘Cause I’m not allowed to get arrested anymore. 
20222,josh,Let’s go back. 
20223,toby,"No, I hate these people with the heat of a nova. Yet here I go. "
20224,toby,Shut up. 
20225,bartlet,Charlie?
20226,bartlet,"Let’s do calls in the residence, okay? "
20227,bartlet,I think there were a couple of late memos.
20228,leo," Good evening, Mr. President. "
20229,bartlet,Thanks. 
20230,bartlet,I’m going to head home. 
20231,leo,At 7:30? 
20232,bartlet,I’ll make calls from the residence. 
20233,leo,Are you feeling all right? 
20234,bartlet,Yeah. 
20235,leo,I heard you lost the site. What’s the backup? 
20236,bartlet,"Well, there’s this wooded land on the Connecticut River, but the Abenaki Indians are  claiming it’s an ancient burial ground. "
20237,leo,Ah. 
20238,bartlet,"There’s a magnificent bluff overlooking an orchard in Orford and the owner is willing,  if not eager, to donate the land. "
20239,leo,What’s the problem? 
20240,bartlet,The owner’s doing 40 months at Allenwood for securities fraud. 
20241,leo,You’ll find a site. 
20242,bartlet,"This is how long I get before I have to start with the library? Two years? And the first  six months was figuring out how to work the phones? Oh, by the way, they’ve changed the  phones again. "
20243,leo,Yeah. 
20244,bartlet,"This is the last job I’ve ever going to have. This is the last time I’m going to come to  work with people. I swear to God, I feel like I was just starting to get good at it. "
20245,leo,"Well, it’s two years, with an option for four more."
20246,leo,"Mr. President, is there anything we need to talk about? "
20247,bartlet,"Not yet, okay? "
20248,leo,Okay. 
20249,bartlet,I’ll see you tomorrow. 
20250,leo,"Thank you, Mr. President. "
20252,sam,I don’t know. 
20254,sam,"Been around. Then I came down here to practice my sugar tossing, ‘cause if you don’t  practice, then you might as well give the clarinet to a kid who’ll use it. "
20256,sam,"When she said that from what she’s heard I’m the one to talk to, that... I have the ear  of the President, you told her to say that, right? "
20258,sam,"I don’t know why you’d think I was like that. I mean, for fun, but... I don’t know why  you’d think I was like that. "
20260,sam,Yeah. 
20262,sam,He was a spy. 
20264,sam,Yes. 
20266,sam,"His code name was ""Black Water"". He copied by hand State Department and White House  documents and delivered them to the Soviets. They included... "
20268,sam,...Roosevelt’s plans to enter the war... 
20270,sam,Possible recruitment targets. 
20272,sam,Lists of Communists and Communist sympathizers in the State Department and National  Recovery Administration. 
20274,sam,"What are you, out of your mind? I’m telling her right now. "
20276,sam,Secret memoranda on the U.S. negotiating stance at Yalta... 
20278,sam,"Good, ‘cause Stalin needed an advantage and we wanted a fair fight. "
20280,sam,The truth isn’t good? 
20282,sam,I’m not her fairy godmother. She asked me to look into this. 
20284,sam,Hey. 
20286,sam,Donna... 
20288,sam,Donna. 
20290,sam,"It was high treason, and it mattered a great deal! This country is an idea, and one that’s  lit the world for two centuries and treason against that idea is not just a crime against  the living! This ground holds the graves of people who died for it, who gave what Lincoln  called the last full measure of devotion. Of fidelity. You understand the last full measure  of devotion to... Treason against them is...  "
20292,sam,There was a translator in the Hungarian trade mission named Shaba Demsky. She was murdered  in 1952. She was about to reveal the name of a Soviet agent called Black Water. This girl’s  going to find out who her father was.
20294,sam,Have you ever heard of a woman named Shaba Demsky? 
20295,sam,"I’m sorry, Stephanie. I wasn’t able to get access to the people I needed, to have it  considered this time around. Why don’t you tell your father you’ll be able to try again  in three months. "
20296,sam,Absolutely. 
20300,sam,It’s just there are certain things you’re sure of... like longitude and latitude. 
20302,josh,Hey...  You should have seen Toby. 
20303,sam,He was good? 
20304,josh,He blew the doors off the place. Then I almost got killed. 
20305,josh,I got hit with a piece of a banana. 
20306,toby,Let’s go. 
20307,josh," You know what you are? You are old school, my friend. "
20308,toby,Stop talking like that. Let’s go. 
20309,josh,"Let me tell you something, though. That was the second time this year I almost got killed  and both times I was with you so you’re going to need a new wingman. "
20310,toby,You were my old wingman? 
20311,josh,Yeah. 
20312,toby,Let’s go. 
20314,josh,"Toby and I are going to get Sam drunk, and then put him to bed. "
20316,toby,Let’s go. 
20317,sam,I’m going to meet you there. 
20318,josh,Yeah? 
20319,josh,All right.
20320,sam, Dad... it’s me. 
20321,sam, This isn't happening.
20322,c.j.,Yeah.
20323,sam,What the hell is he doing?
20324,c.j.,It's a recipe for deep fried fantail shrimp.
20325,sam,"Yeah. But, what's he still doing up there?"
20326,c.j.,He's got a recipe book.
20327,sam,How long will it go?
20328,c.j.,I don't know.
20329,sam,I'm saying how many recipes are there?
20330,c.j.,Altogether?
20331,sam,Yeah.
20332,c.j.,"I can't cook, but I think there are probably like 20 or 30."
20333,sam,You're screwing around with me.
20334,c.j.,"Oh, yeah."
20335,sam,"I'm about to miss the 7:30 shuttle. If I miss the 8:30, I miss the last train to  Sag Harbor."
20336,c.j.,You can spend the night in New York.
20337,sam,I've only got two nights. And you've gotta see this house.
20338,c.j.,It's cool?
20339,sam,It's a Frank Lloyd Wright.
20340,c.j.,Isn't it cold in Sag Harbor right now?
20341,sam,We wear sweaters. It's a Tommy Hilfiger ad.
20342,c.j.,It can't last forever.
20343,sam,He's got 20 to 30 recipes he can still read.
20344,c.j.,"Sam, seriously, there are more recipes than that."
20345,sam,Who cares? He's blowing my weekend in the Hamptons.
20346,c.j.,Maybe he doesn't know about the sweaters.
20347,c.j.,I know!
20348,josh,Who gave him the recipe book?
20349,c.j.,"I really don't think we can blame this on the recipe book. Plus, I now know the secret to  cold asparagus chantilly is a quarter cup whipped cream."
20350,josh,"I'm going to Port Saint Lucie, which may not mean anything to you, but happens to be the  spring training home of the..."
20351,c.j.,"New York Jets. Yes, you've told me. Josh, you can watch basketball on T.V."
20352,josh,"Yes, except the New York Knicks are a basketball team, the New York Jets are a football  team, and Port Saint Lucie is the spring training home of the New York..."
20353,c.j.," Mets! Yes. Dammit, I'm inadequate."
20354,josh,"A weekend at spring training. Mike Piazza is going to be standing in the batting cage.  He's going to turn and see me. He's going to say, 'Dude.'"
20355,c.j.,"Well, I wouldn't want you to miss a legitimate 'dude' sighting."
20356,josh, So I can take off?
20357,c.j.,No.
20358,c.j.,"Guys, I'm sorry, but you know what? Listen, seriously, you're looking at democracy at  work, it's a beautiful thing."
20359,c.j.,"Well, I wouldn't think it would be that much longer."
20360,c.j.,"Yeah, but how many recipes can there be? 20? 30?"
20361,c.j.,"Yeah, but you know what, Mark? This is just the kind of thing that can cleanse the palate  of a relationship that's gone stale. Like a fine sorbet."
20362,c.j.,And she's already bitching about dinner?
20363,c.j.,Lose her. 
20364,c.j.,"Listen up! Everybody, this was unforeseen. Obviously, he's got to finish sometime. When  he does, there will be a vote immediately. When it's done, the President will make his  calls, White House staff will be available for comment, and most important you will all  write about it. In the mean time, I say, pizza for everybody! Who's with me? "
20365,c.j.,Excellent!
20366,c.j.,"We're going to need like a massive truckload of pizza. And, I don't know, maybe some  Cuervo 1800 if we've got it lying around."
20367,c.j.,Just enough for me.
20368,toby,"C.J., just so you know, I need to be at Telluride first thing in the morning."
20369,c.j.,That's a rough assignment you pulled there.
20370,toby,"No, I'm saying, I already missed the 6:50 to Denver, but I can catch an 8:40 from  National if I change planes in Chicago."
20371,c.j.,"And as you're travel agent, it's important that you update me on that information."
20372,c.j.,I'm supposed to be on my way to Napa right now for my Dad's 70th birthday. You hear me  complaining?
20373,toby,You just did.
20374,c.j.,Get out.
20375,toby,It's your dad's 70th birthday?
20376,c.j.,Yeah.
20377,toby,You doing anything?
20378,c.j.,"Yeah, we're all getting together in Napa."
20379,toby, I meant right now.
20380,c.j.,No. I'm sitting and waiting. I'm ordering pizza. I'm catching up on e-mails.
20381,toby,All right. I got a a basketball game on in my office if you want to come by?
20382,c.j.,Is it the Jets and the Mets?
20383,toby,It's the Nets and the Hawks.  The Jets and the Mets?
20384,c.j.,I know the teams. I'm joking when I do this. I'm joking when I do this.
20385,toby,Okay. 
20386,toby,You know there's a 9:00 to SFO. You could drive to Napa.
20387,c.j.,Yeah.
20388,toby,All right. I'm in my office.
20389,c.j.,It'll end.
20390,toby,Do you have any idea how many recipes there are?
20391,c.j.,I really don't.
20392,c.j.,"You keep the floor as long as you hold the floor. What does that mean? It means you can't  stop talking, ever. You can't eat, and you can't drink, which is fine, because you can't  leave the chamber to use the bathroom, either. But all that's nothing compared to this:  you're not allowed to sit down. You're not allowed to lean on anything or, for that matter,  anyone. It started with the bill you'll read about tomorrow morning called the Family  Wellness Act. Josh had been leading staffers from the Legislative Liaison Office in  negotiations with the conference chairman for weeks and this last Monday morning he  walked into the Roosevelt Room and said..."
20393,josh,We got the Family Wellness Act.
20394,leo,It's done?
20395,josh,"Yes, sir."
20396,leo,"What'd we get, what'd we lose?"
20397,josh,We got most of what we wanted in Title VII.
20398,c.j.,That's infant hearing loss?
20399,josh,"Yeah, we got a hearing test for every child born in the U.S."
20400,sam,What about...?
20401,josh,We did not get mandatory tests for children not born in hospitals.
20402,sam,We can live with that.
20403,leo,The Special Needs Adoption Awareness program?
20404,josh,"Right, this is a national campaign to provide information to the public regarding the  adoption of special needs children."
20405,leo,How'd we get it?
20406,josh,By agreeing to a provision that would require health care staff to give pregnant women  information about adoption on an equal basis with all other courses of action.
20407,c.j.,National Organization for Women's gonna hate that.
20408,josh,I know.
20409,c.j.,Women seeking abortions should not be required by law to be lectured at.
20410,josh,"Yeah, but you're gonna help me out there, right?"
20411,c.j.,"Yes, I will. I will once again and betray the sisterhood."
20412,c.j.," Okay, I saw you, you, you, and you roll your eyes."
20413,c.j.,I felt you.
20414,leo," We're done! Josh Lyman, everybody."
20415,sam,Nice job.
20416,josh,"I know, I'm thinking seriously about turning pro."
20417,sam,Yeah?
20418,josh,"Yeah, I got agents talking to me, telling me I could go high in the second round, maybe  low in the first if I have a good postseason."
20419,sam,"You don't want to stay in school, get your education?"
20420,josh,"Nah, I'm white, nobody's gonna mind."
20421,leo,"Josh, this looks good. I mean, he stuck sunsets on a bunch of small-ticket items, but..."
20422,josh,That's the way it's gonna happen.
20423,leo,You just spent six billion dollars on health care. How do you feel?
20424,josh,I'd feel better if it meant just once I could go to a doctor without filling out  something on a clipboard.
20425,leo,"All right, what else?"
20426,toby,"Philip Sluman, who's the chairman of the Petroleum Producers of America, testified  yesterday to the FTC that ""the Bartlet administration's"" - blah, blah - ""relentless  pursuit of emissions standards in the form of additives like MTBE is a big reason  we've seen price hikes in some parts of the country."""
20427,leo,The Energy Secretary's got to respond.
20428,toby,The Energy Secretary's gonna respond and I'd like to mention that to the Vice President.
20429,leo,You want me to do it?
20430,toby,I got it.
20431,leo,He's gonna be pretty unhappy.
20432,toby,Yep.
20433,leo,Anything else?
20434,toby,No...
20435,c.j.,Nope.
20436,josh,"No sir, thank you."
20437,c.j.,Charlie.
20438,c.j.,May I call you Chip?
20439,c.j.,Chipper?
20440,c.j.,Gilligan?
20441,c.j.,Yes?
20442,c.j.,He's got 38 wives.
20443,c.j.,Imagine being the girl he dated who he didn't marry.
20444,c.j.,Hassan Ali is coming?
20445,c.j.,Okay.
20446,c.j.,Display it.
20447,c.j.,They should talk to the gift officer.
20448,c.j.,And?
20449,c.j.,I'm sorry?
20450,c.j.,"Did you say a small, ceramic statue?"
20451,c.j.,Okay...  okay... okay.
20452,c.j.,Yes?
20453,c.j.,"Well, I have to think about it, Charlie. It was a year ago, and it's not like I have  instant recall of every ceramic cat statue I've ever been handed in Cairo."
20454,c.j.,Tell Protocol I'm searching my recollection.
20455,c.j.,Leave me now.
20456,c.j.,Toby.
20457,toby,"I'm going to see Hoynes, talk to me later."
20458,c.j.,"Okay, Carol?"
20459,c.j.,"Some information, possibly a disguise, and a fast getaway car. Come inside."
20460,toby,"Good morning, Mr. Vice President."
20461,toby,I knew it was pretty big.
20462,toby," Philip Sluman, testifying yesterday in front of the FTC, charged that it  was the White House's pursuit of tighter emissions standards that's caused the rise  in prices..."
20463,toby,"Mr. Vice President, I don't want to go round and round with you on Sluman."
20464,toby,He had no point.
20465,toby,It's price gouging... 
20466,toby,It costs marginally more to refine the fuel with the additives and the cost is being  passed on to the consumer at an outrageous markup.
20467,toby,"Well, it's good to know the companies can make it through the lean times."
20468,toby,"Anyway, sir, tomorrow night, Bill Trotter's gonna be delivering a speech to the Detroit  Economic Counsel on Energy Efficiency in the 21st century, and we're gonna rewrite the  draft to include a fairly strong rebuttal to Phillip Sluman's remarks."
20469,toby,Why?
20470,toby,Still...
20471,toby,Who would you send?
20472,toby,Really?
20473,toby,Mr. Vice President...
20474,toby, Would you mind if I prepared some notes for you?
20475,toby," No, sir... well, thank you, sir, we appreciate it."
20476,toby,We scheduled the vote for Friday at noon.
20477,toby,"Thank you, Mr. Vice President. "
20478,c.j.," Well, somebody forgot to tell Stackhouse, Dad, cause he just went into  hour number eight."
20479,c.j.,Hey.
20480,sam,Hey.
20481,c.j.,What are you doing?
20482,sam,"Well, it's a little complicated and indeed difficult to explain in layman's terms."
20483,c.j.,You can put the black seven on the red eight.
20484,sam,Thanks.
20485,c.j.,"Hey Sam, who's your favorite writer?"
20486,sam,Toby.
20487,c.j.,Who's your favorite fiction writer?
20488,sam,You're listening to him right now.
20489,c.j.,You like Dickens?
20490,sam,Yeah.
20491,c.j.,"You know I never got a chance to say... I mean, I feel bad about your dad and  everything."
20492,sam,"Yeah. We're doing better. You know, the ice is starting to thaw."
20493,c.j.,I'm in the middle of an e-mail to my father.
20494,sam,Do you talk to him a lot?
20495,c.j.,Not enough. You're gonna miss the last plane.
20496,sam,I'll take Amtrak to Penn Station and rent a car.
20497,c.j.,"Okay. Well, I just came down to get this coffee."
20498,sam,Go back to your e-mail.
20499,c.j.,"Hey, did I hear you got spanked by some 14-year-old kid interning at the GAO?"
20500,sam,"I did not get spanked. And she was 19 years old, and I demonstrated once again that I  am open to all forms of debate."
20501,c.j.,With an intern.
20502,sam,If need be.
20503,c.j.,Okay.
20504,sam,She was very crafty.
20505,c.j.,Who?
20506,sam,The intern from the GAO.
20507,c.j.,Yeah.
20508,sam,Go back to your e-mail.
20509,c.j.,I am.
20510,sam,Okay.
20511,c.j.,I'm taking my coffee with me.
20512,sam,I'll see you upstairs.
20513,josh,Write this down. I need to find out if sufficient funds have been appropriated to the  FAA to begin work on data-link communications.
20514,josh,That's when you get me on the phone. Sam...
20515,josh,What are you doing?
20516,sam,I'm looking for a piece of fruit.
20517,josh,"Can we show you something from the back, or...?"
20518,sam,I'm fine.
20519,josh,"Okay, here's one. Uh... the White House has been instructed by Congress to compile a  list of 400 government reports that should be eliminated as they serve little purpose  and cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars."
20520,sam, I will.
20521,josh,Right. You're not in this meeting. You're shopping for fruit.
20522,sam,I'm done with the fruit. I was listening to what you were saying.
20523,josh,You want to do this?
20524,sam,Absolutely.
20525,josh,Why?
20526,sam,"Because it's insane! We got over 3,000 reports from federal agencies last year.  Agriculture spent $40 million producing 280 reports. Four years of college, three  years of law school, I spent 30 bucks at Kinko's. Give me the thing."
20527,josh,All right. We're done.
20528,sam," Let me tell you people something. The GAO needs a little housekeeping,  and that's my nickname, okay? I'm ""The Housekeeper."""
20529,toby,Hey.
20530,sam,"God, that's a terrible nickname."
20531,josh,"Well, start getting used to it for a while."
20532,toby,Let me talk to you for a second.
20533,sam, What's going on?
20534,toby,I was just with Hoynes.
20535,josh,About Sluman's testimony?
20536,toby,Yeah.
20537,josh,What did he say?
20538,toby,He defended it.
20539,sam,Isn't that what you expected?
20540,toby,Yeah.
20541,sam,Did you tell him Bill Trotter was gonna be...?
20542,toby,Yeah.
20543,josh,What did he say?
20544,toby,He said he wanted to do it himself.
20545,josh,Really?
20546,toby,Yeah.
20547,sam,I don't understand.
20548,toby,He said he's doing a press conference tomorrow on...
20549,sam,Antitrust.
20550,toby,"Yeah, and he'll take questions at the end. And they'll ask about the Sluman testimony,  and he'll step up."
20551,josh,"Well, somebody's got to be there."
20552,toby,"Oh, I'm gonna be there. If he ducks, Trotter goes on in Detroit. But, still, is it  clear to you what he's doing?"
20553,sam,No.
20554,toby,Me neither. 
20555,sam,What's that?
20556,sam,Wasn't that program terminated?
20557,sam,But we write the reports anyway.
20558,sam,Lose it.
20559,sam,Which tells us?
20560,sam,Anything in there I don't get from the song?
20561,sam,Lose it.
20562,sam,Excuse me?
20563,sam,You made a little sound there.
20564,sam,Okay.
20565,sam,Lose it.
20566,sam,Can I help you?
20567,sam,Who are you?
20568,sam,Let's go watch.
20569,sam, You stay a second. You're an intern.
20570,sam,"What are you, 14 years old?"
20571,sam,And what's your problem with my cutting reports?
20572,sam,What's your name?
20573,sam,Should I call you Winnie?
20574,sam,And I don't.
20575,sam,"Winnifred, the accounting office tells me I can save the taxpayers $3 million by  cutting 400 reports."
20576,sam,"Okay, you know what..."
20577,sam,They don't mean anything.
20578,sam,"Hey-hey, you're talking to senior staff."
20579,sam, Report on the Obstacles to State and Local Training Needs in  the Solid Waste Management and Resource Recovery. You know what this is?
20580,sam,It's about career opportunities for garbage men.
20581,sam,"I think it's a tough sell, and I don't need a report to tell me that."
20582,sam,That's...
20583,sam,I knew that.
20584,sam,"So, the numbers would be even higher today."
20585,sam,How do you know all that?
20586,sam,You've read the report?
20587,sam,Why?
20588,sam,"No, I-I mean, why?"
20589,sam,"So, it just happens you read the report I pulled off the top?"
20590,sam,You've read them all.
20591,sam,Yes.
20592,sam,Winnie.
20593,sam,"Yeah, I said it. Listen, you're talented. When you get out of school, you should come  see me for a job."
20594,c.j.,"Back to the cat story dad, I've done my research, and sure enough, I was quite screwed.  I was in trouble, and I needed to tell someone, a cohort. Someone whose criminal mind  is equal to my own."
20595,c.j.,"Donna, I need to talk to you right now."
20597,c.j.,"So, we went to Cairo last year."
20599,c.j.,Right.
20601,c.j.,I didn't which is sad for me.
20603,c.j.,"I may be in a spot of trouble, yes."
20605,c.j.,"Hassan Ali gave the President a gift, a small ceramic statue of Bast."
20607,c.j.,Bast. A cat goddess. She was...
20609,c.j.,She was the patron saint of Bubastis and rose to prominence during the period of the  22nd Dynasty.
20611,c.j.,I looked it up. The cats in the temple...
20613,c.j.,"The temple of Bubastis, maybe, I don't know. The cats in the temple wore jeweled  collars. They were treated royally. They thought cats controlled the movement of  the moon. They had total authority over royal houses because of their ability to  see in the dark. Anyone who killed a cat was put to death."
20615,c.j.,"I broke the damn statue. Not badly, but you know, in several pieces. And since it came  out of his own collection, breaking the figurine would amount to a personal affront  implying he had bad taste, and that the object was of little personal value to the  President."
20617,c.j.,The gift officer handed it to me. I tossed it in my suitcase.
20619,c.j.,Do you have any idea how many pieces of crap gets stuck in the President's hands every  time he leaves the building?
20621,c.j.,"Well, apparently not, because she handed it to me with a couple of T-shirts and a box of  baklava."
20623,c.j.,I thought maybe you'd have an idea.
20625,c.j.,But you're gonna.
20629,josh, Who has my wallet?
20630,josh,Thank you.
20632,josh,Yeah.
20634,josh,"Yeah, I'm not taking it."
20636,josh,He wants an amendment added to the Family Wellness Act that'll allocate money for  autism care and research.
20638,josh,"This is what's called a ""Christmas tree bill."" Everyone hangs amendments on it. We just  closed it this morning. We try to hang a star on top..."
20640,josh,"Yeah, Stackhouse isn't really someone who has a lot of muscle on this, so..."

20644,c.j.,There's no way.
20645,josh,"Afternoon, Senator."

20648,josh,Sir...

20653,josh,I don't need to tell you that in these negotiations...
20654,josh,Sir...
20655,josh," There's no doubt that that's a good point, but in order for us to ensure that  more important things were in the bill..."
20656,josh,I'm sorry?
20657,josh,"Senator, there's going to be a vote. The bill's closed."
20658,josh,"To do that would mean to postpone the vote, and everyone's breaking for the recess, and..."

20686,josh,To thank her for a pair of shoes she sent me.
20688,josh,"Donna, please try and keep it..."
20690,josh,Donna?
20692,bartlet,Leo.
20693,leo,"Good evening, sir."
20694,bartlet,You busy?
20695,leo,What do you need?
20696,bartlet,Come have dinner with me.
20697,leo,Why?
20698,bartlet,Pierre Boileau is cooking tonight. You want to have dinner?
20699,leo,What's he serving?
20700,bartlet,That's your answer?
20701,leo,I'm just asking.
20702,bartlet,"Well, I can tell you that the man specializes in a reinterpretation of classic Provençale  cuisine. Cassoulet, duck with green olives..."
20703,leo,Yeah...
20704,bartlet,...saffron chicken...
20705,leo,I haven't had a good saffron chicken in quite some time.
20706,bartlet,"Well, don't you think you deserve one?"
20707,leo,Yes.
20708,bartlet,"His specialty is his dessert, tomate du saltambique."
20709,leo,"That's gonna be a big, seedless beefsteak tomato stweed for three hours in creme de  caramel and stuffed with..."
20710,bartlet,"Passion fruit, kiwi and hazelnuts, and..."
20711,leo,"...served on a pomegranate reduction, yes."
20712,bartlet,Let's go. Leave the cell phone.
20713,leo,I'm taking my phone.
20714,bartlet,We're not leaving the building. People can find you.
20715,leo,Let's go.
20716,bartlet,What's he on to now?
20717,leo,He's reading the rules of cards.
20718,bartlet,"Oh, brother."
20719,leo,Don't worry about it.
20720,bartlet,Could Howard Stackhouse possibly be a bigger horse's patoot?
20721,leo,"I don't know what part of a horse that is, exactly, but I've always thought he was a  decent guy."
20722,bartlet,"He's a curmudgeon, a grouchy old crank."
20723,leo,So are we.
20724,bartlet,You are. I am full of mirth.
20725,leo,Okay.
20726,bartlet,"He was all over me the first year. He called me, ""Bartlet the Inert."""
20727,leo,That was pretty funny.
20728,bartlet,"I'm a reformer. I'm the most liberal President he's ever served under. His hero, Hubert  Humphrey, once, you know..."
20729,leo,Shook your hand.
20730,bartlet,That's right.  I feel bad.
20731,leo,Why?
20732,bartlet,His wife died a few years ago. I didn't go to the funeral.
20733,leo,Why?
20734,bartlet,"I was kind of busy running for President, Leo."
20735,leo,That's right.
20736,bartlet,"Tomate du Saltambique, my friend."
20737,leo,"Yes, indeed."
20738,bartlet,"Hi. Hang on.  They thought I was going to be eating with Abbey, so..."
20739,leo,Hmm...
20740,bartlet,"We'll just, you know, pretend there's no candlelight."
20741,leo,And that we're not paranoid homophobes in any way.
20742,bartlet,Yeah.
20743,leo,Yeah.
20744,bartlet,"Leo, you have a deputy who's, frankly, a lot smarter than you are. Whatever it is, let  him handle it. Who are you talking to?"
20745,leo,My deputy.  Yeah.
20746,bartlet,What did he say?
20747,leo,He says there's no end in sight.
20748,bartlet,Okay. Let's eat.
20749,c.j.,Yeah.
20751,c.j.,What?
20753,c.j.,What's the problem?
20755,c.j.,"Oh, holy hell. Tell Josh. Find out for sure."
20757,bartlet,"Nah, I'm fine."
20758,bartlet,"No, she's up at the Manchester house."
20759,bartlet,"No, it really sucks, but thanks."
20760,bartlet,"Did you hear that? He said, ""Very good, sir"". Where do they learn that?"
20761,leo,Yeah.  I'm sorry?
20762,bartlet,Nothing.
20763,leo," I'm sure that was moved for a reason. We're prepping for a G-8 with Barney,  and we're going to Tel Aviv."
20764,bartlet,I just feel like we don't talk anymore.
20765,leo, What?
20766,bartlet,See you're not even listing.
20767,leo," Ben, let me call you back. What's your problem?"
20768,bartlet,"I'm just saying we work all day, and then the day's over, and we go out to dinner and  you're still working, and you know, I'm sitting here. No time to talk."
20769,leo,"You know, conversations like this, are the reason I got divorced."
20770,bartlet,"No, it's not. "
20771,leo, Sir... what's wrong?
20772,bartlet,I made...
20773,leo,"Uh... I'm fine, Billy."
20774,bartlet,I made a deal with Abbey... 'cause of my thing.
20775,leo,One term?
20776,bartlet," My thing, by the way, is the reason that Hoynes stepped up on oil."
20777,leo,'Cause he thinks maybe...
20778,bartlet,Yeah.
20779,leo,It was three years ago. She can't expect...
20780,leo, It's C.J. Stackhouse has an autistic grandson.
20781,bartlet, Let's go.
20782,leo," C.J., we're coming up."
20783,c.j.,Charlie?
20784,c.j.,Thanks. Can we wait?
20785,c.j.,It's not broken.
20787,c.j.,"I didn't know what it was. I needed a potpourri holder. I have the ancient curse of Bast  on me so get off my back, Sparky."
20788,c.j.,"And the potpourri, right?"
20789,bartlet,How does he not just tell me?
20790,leo,Sir... 
20791,bartlet,"How does he not come to me and say ""Jed, this is my grandson and there are lots more like  him and there are lots more to come. Can you help us out?"""
20792,leo,Because he...
20793,bartlet,Damn it. He knows we would have gotten it done. Why doesn't he tell me?
20794,leo,"Because he doesn't want to make political hay out of his grandson, which is commendable."
20795,bartlet,"Nah, he's a crank."
20796,c.j.,"Good evening, Mr. President."
20797,bartlet,"Hey. Hey Donna, you need something?"
20798,c.j.,Donna's the one who started sniffing around it.
20799,bartlet,"C.J., that phone message was for real. He's not going to stop till he drops."
20800,c.j.,He might.
20801,bartlet,"C.J., let me tell you something. Don't ever, ever underestimate the will of a  grandfather. We're mad men. We don't give a damn. We got here before you and they'll  be here after. We'll make enemies, we'll break laws, we'll break bones but you will  not mess with the grandchildren."
20802,leo,There was quite a bit of sugar in the crème de caramel.
20803,c.j.,Yeah.
20804,bartlet,C.J.... If I told you to screw the print deadline what would you want to do right now?
20805,c.j.,I'd want to see if there's a way I could help him out.
20806,bartlet,Give him some dignity right? And give him a rest. The guy's going to collapse out there.
20807,c.j.,"Yes, sir."
20808,bartlet,Screw the print deadline. Leo?
20809,leo,Look...
20810,bartlet,We will talk about the other thing later.
20811,leo,I'm just asking how we're going to do this.
20813,leo,The Chairman's going to gavel him off if he stops talking or sits.
20815,leo, What are you doing?
20817,leo,We usually don't raise our hands.
20818,bartlet,Though it's not the worst idea in the world.
20820,leo,What do you mean?
20822,bartlet,I was in the House. I know nothing about Senate rules.
20824,c.j.,"I'm pretty sure it's true, sir."
20825,bartlet,What time is it? Let's wake up a parliamentarian.
20826,leo,"Yeah, but the problem is the only people who ask questions are Senators."
20827,bartlet,We're going to get one of them to walk in there. Charlie!
20828,leo,The Senate wants to go home. They want a vote.
20829,bartlet,"I want to call Senators. We'll start with our friends. When we're done with those two,  we'll go on to the other 98."
20830,c.j.,Charlie!
20831,c.j.,Start with the grandfathers.
20832,bartlet,There's no damn holiday for us either.
20833,leo,We'll be in the dining room.
20834,bartlet,"C.J., no kidding, make this happen."
20835,c.j.,"Yes, sir.  Oh and, I broke you're statue."
20837,c.j.,No.
20838,toby, Mr. Vice President?
20839,toby,"No, sir, you did it very well. I appreciate it."
20840,toby,I'm sure you know I was curious about why you'd volunteer for something like that.
20841,toby,So I got ahold of some private polling you've had done.
20842,toby,A significant number of people are concerned over your close ties to big oil.
20843,toby,"Yeah, but what I was wondering was why did you put the poll in the field at all?  Mr. Vice President, what do you know that I don't?"
20844,c.j.," Do I have your word on that, Sarah?"
20845,c.j.,Got it!
20846,sam,Come on.
20847,josh,Come on.
20848,bartlet,"Trust me just this once, you grouchy old son of a bitch."
20849,toby,Leo.
20850,leo,"Hey, I didn’t know you were still here."
20851,toby,Yeah.
20852,leo,What’s going on?
20853,toby,I’ve been thinking... about why Hoynes volunteered to slap down big oil.
20854,leo,It was his polling information.
20855,toby,"Yeah, but why did he put the poll in the field at all, is what I’m saying."
20856,leo,John Hoynes is an egomaniac who needs to be told what people think of him.
20857,toby," Well, that’s pretty unusual for Washington."
20858,leo,Yeah.
20859,toby," Leo, has there been a discussion in some room, some place, anywhere on  any level about Hoynes being dropped from the ticket in 2002?"
20860,leo,No.
20861,toby,You sure?
20862,leo,Yep.
20863,toby,‘Cause I thought maybe it was an Eisenhower-Nixon...
20864,leo,"No, Toby, I wouldn’t give it a lot of thought."
20865,toby,Okay. 
20866,toby,Hey.
20867,leo, You scared the hell out of me.
20868,toby,The poll that Hoynes put in the field...
20869,leo,Hoynes is going to run for President one day. Why shouldn’t he do his own polling?
20870,toby," He’s going to run for President six years from now, what good does last  week's do?"
20871,leo,I really don’t know. 
20872,toby,Okay.
20873,leo,No.
20874,toby,A Vice President would never challenge a sitting President for the nomination.
20875,leo,‘Course not.
20876,toby,You see his itinerary for the weekend?
20877,leo,Who?
20878,toby,The Vice President.
20879,leo,I don’t keep tabs on John.
20880,toby,"He’s giving a speech at a semiconductor plant. The title of the speech is, ""Clean air  industry in the high-tech Corridor of the Industrial Northeast."""
20881,leo,Where?
20882,toby,Nashua. New Hampshire.
20883,leo,"Toby, nobody, and particularly not Hoynes would be naïve enough... what I mean to say is  if he’s going to New Hampshire for the reason you’re thinking he would mask it with  something. It wouldn’t be an official trip. He’d make up a benign excuse to be up there."
20884,toby,I know.
20885,leo,So why are you concerned about the speech?
20886,toby,Because it comes in the middle of a three-day camping trip to Killington.  Why does  Hoynes think the President isn’t going to run again? 
20887,toby,"What’s going on, Leo? "
20888,leo,"Excuse me, Mr. President?"
20889,bartlet,I closed the embassies in Tanzania and Brussels.
20890,leo,What about domestic?
20891,bartlet,I don’t have to make that call yet.
20892,leo,How much time do you have?
20893,bartlet,About an hour.
20894,leo,"Mr. President, I’ve got Toby waiting in his office right now. "
20895,bartlet,Why?
20896,leo,We’ve got to tell him.
20897,bartlet,Tell him what?
20898,leo,We’ve got to tell him.
20899,bartlet,What happened?
20900,leo,He got curious when Hoynes volunteered to step in for Bill Trotter. And then more  curious when he found out it was 'cause Hoynes put a poll in the field.
20901,bartlet,Yeah...
20902,leo,"Now he’s camping in Killington, Vermont, with a quick stop..."
20903,bartlet,Come on!
20904,leo,"...in New Hampshire, and Toby’s not an idiot."
20905,bartlet,He...
20906,leo,None of them are.
20907,bartlet,He scheduled a trip to New Hampshire?
20908,leo,High-tech corridor of the Northeast.
20909,bartlet,"Yeah, thanks to who?"
20910,leo,What does that matter right now?
20911,leo,I think you got to see this as an opportunity...
20912,bartlet,To do what?
20913,leo,To gauge reaction.
20914,bartlet,You think Toby’s reaction is going to be the same as the public’s?
20915,leo,I meant the staff.
20916,bartlet,Which will be?
20917,leo,"I’m sorry, sir?"
20918,bartlet, The staff’s reaction will be what?
20919,leo,I don’t know! Shock. Betrayal. Confusion. Concern about our future.
20920,leo,I don’t know.
20921,bartlet,What do I tell him?
20922,leo,Everything.
20923,bartlet,Go get him.
20924,leo,"Yes, sir."
20925,bartlet,Now it starts.
20926,sam,Hmm...
20927,josh,Yes...
20928,sam,Well...
20929,josh,You know what the problem with this is?
20930,sam,Yes.
20931,josh,It’s supposed to be funny.
20932,sam,And yet...
20933,josh,It’s not. 
20934,sam,No.
20935,josh,Who worked on this?
20936,sam,"Jay Breech, Janet Lippman. Andy Kyle worked on it a little."
20937,josh,You know what they did?
20938,sam,Yeah.
20939,josh,They forgot to bring the funny.
20940,sam,Yeah.
20941,josh,How much time do we have?
20942,sam,I want to show it to him within the hour.
20943,josh,Toby?
20944,toby,Yeah?
20945,josh,Sam and I are going to stay and punch up some of the jokes from the Correspondents’  Dinner.
20946,toby,"Yeah, I read it."
20947,josh,They forgot the funny. 
20948,toby,Yeah.
20949,josh,You want to stay?
20950,toby,Where are you going to be?
20951,josh,We'll find a place.
20952,toby,I’ll hook up with you in a little bit.
20953,josh,What’s going on?
20954,leo,Nothing.
20955,josh,Okay.
20957,josh, How you doing? 
20959,josh,Did you get the flowers?
20961,josh,Did you like ‘em?
20963,josh,Do you know why I sent them?
20965,josh,It’s our anniversary.
20967,josh,I’m the sort of guy who remembers those things.
20969,josh,I’m quite something. 
20971,josh,I sent them to mark an occasion.
20973,josh,For I am a man of occasion.
20975,josh,"Well, you started working for me once in February and then you stopped for a while."
20977,josh,"Then you started working for me again in April. That’s the one I choose to celebrate,  because it’s the only one where you started working for me and it wasn’t followed by  your not working but rather going back to your boyfriend, and how, in comparison to  that and him, you can call me mean is simply another in a long series of..."
20979,josh,"No. No, no, no. "
20981,josh,"Sam and I are going to punch up the thing for tomorrow. Hey, we need funny people."
20983,josh,You know any? 
20984,josh,"See, right there was a joke. It’s the oldest joke in the book..."
20986,josh,"You know what, Ado Annie, I sent you flowers! I think what you’re trying to say is,  ‘Why, thank you, Josh! They’re beautiful! How very thoughtful of you. Not many bosses  would have been that thoughtful...’"
20988,josh,"Okay, well, then I guessed wrong."
20990,josh,"Yes, I do, because you are such an hysterically funny person... did you see how I used  ‘an’ there properly?"
20992,josh,You crack me up.
20994,josh,"So the flowers really did the trick, huh?"
20996,sam,Didn’t you hear me shouting?
20997,sam,And...?
20998,sam,Because...?
20999,sam,You’re adorable.
21000,sam,Go figure.
21001,sam,What are you doing?
21002,sam,Why?
21003,sam,Reunion?
21004,sam,Who else is on the panel?
21005,sam,"You know, something like 40 percent of all women oppose the ERA, and in my entire  lifetime, I’ve never met one of them."
21006,sam,You’re not...
21007,sam,You’re not!
21008,sam,"You’re not, you’re not, you’re not one of those people!"
21009,sam,"You’re going back to Smith College, the cradle of feminism, to argue in opposition of  the Equal Rights Amendment?"
21010,sam,They’re gonna hate you.
21011,sam,Yeah.
21012,sam,"I want to punch up some of the jokes for the Correspondents’ Dinner, and I’m looking for  people left in the building who are funny. I can't find any, so I came to you."
21013,sam,Do you wanna help me or not?
21014,sam,We’ve ordered Chinese food.
21015,leo,Did you see the draft for the Correspondents’ Dinner?
21016,toby,Yeah.
21017,leo,It’s not funny.
21018,toby,Sam’s going to work on it.
21019,leo,"Toby, take it easy in there, okay?"
21020,toby,"Good evening, Mr. President."
21021,bartlet,"Hey, Toby. You want a drink?"
21022,toby,"No, thank you, sir. I'm fine."
21023,bartlet,Have a drink with me.
21024,toby,Sure.
21025,bartlet,"Bourbon, no ice."
21026,toby,Thank you.
21027,bartlet,"You know what I just found out recently? To be called ""bourbon,"" it has to come from  Kentucky. Otherwise it’s called sour mash. An Algerian-born terrorist named Reda Nessam  was arrested at the Canadian border yesterday with a U-Haul containing ten 2-ounce jars  filled with nitroglycerin."
21028,toby,And they don’t allow that kind of thing at Yosemite?
21029,bartlet,"No. Anyway, on advice from State and Intelligence, I closed the embassies in Tanzania  and Brussels."
21030,toby,What about the FAA?
21031,bartlet,"They want me to order the airports, heighten security, but it’s a holiday weekend.  I don’t know. Toby, I got to tell you something..."
21032,toby,Does the FAA have to present evidence of a credible theory?
21033,bartlet,Yeah.
21034,toby,How do they do that?
21035,bartlet,I don’t know. They do it...
21036,toby,"Is there... excuse me, sir. Is there a time frame?"
21037,bartlet,"About an hour. Toby, around ten years ago, for a period of a few months, I was feeling  run down and I had a pain in my leg. They both eventually subsided, but then eight  years ago, the pain came back, as well as numbness. My vision would be blurry sometimes  and I’d get dizzy. During an eye exam, the doctor detected abnormal pupil responses  and ordered an MRI. The radiologist found plaque on my brain and spine. I have a  relapsing-remitting course of MS."
21038,toby,"I’m sorry, sir?"
21039,bartlet,"I have Multiple Sclerosis, Toby."
21040,toby,"What does ""relapsing-remitting"" mean?"
21041,bartlet,I'm sorry?
21042,toby,"What does ""relapsing-remitting"" mean?"
21043,bartlet,It's... I don't know... it's the good kind of MS.
21044,toby,It's the good kind.
21045,bartlet,"Yeah, as opposed to secondary progressive."
21046,toby,Which is the bad kind.
21047,bartlet,Yeah. MS is a chronic disease of the central nervous system. Symptoms can be as mild as  numbness or as severe as paralysis.
21048,toby,And loss of vision?
21049,bartlet,Yeah.
21050,toby,Cognitive function?
21051,bartlet,Yup.
21052,toby,"Is it... I'm sorry, is it fatal?"
21053,bartlet,No. That's the good news. The bad news is there's no cure.
21054,toby,"Yeah, that I knew.  Does relapsing..."
21055,bartlet,Ever turn into secondary progressive?
21056,toby,Yeah.
21057,bartlet,Sure.
21058,toby,Is there any way of telling if it's going to?
21059,bartlet,No.
21060,toby,Okay.
21061,toby, I'd like to stand up. Can I stand?
21062,bartlet,Yeah.
21063,toby,"I'm sorry, sir, uh... I need to... Can I, uh... Excuse me."
21064,bartlet,Yeah.
21065,leo,"Charlie, could you put it through to my office?"
21066,leo,Go take it in my office.
21067,josh,See?
21068,josh,Larry?
21069,josh,See the problem?
21070,josh,"No, they didn't.  What are you doing?"
21072,josh,You think the President's gonna get heckled?
21074,josh,"Okay, here we go. ""Ladies and Gentlemen, I am very happy to be here. And I want to thank  the White House Correspondents Association for inviting me. I expect I'll be stuck here  tonight with my fair share of verbal harpoons. I don't mind, just don't stick me...   with... the... dinner check."" Wow."
21076,josh,"Yeah, well, unless we give that instruction to the audience I don't think it's going to  be a problem."
21077,sam,Hey!
21078,josh,"""I don't mind, just don't stick me with the dinner check?"""
21079,sam,"I know, it's like he's playing Grossinger's."
21082,josh,We're not gonna need a dead audience joke.
21083,josh,I did. Me. Those are from me.
21085,josh,Our anniversary.
21087,josh,Donna doesn't like to talk about it.
21089,sam," A few years ago, Donna's boyfriend broke up with her so she started working  for Josh. But then, the boyfriend told her to come back, and she did. And then they broke  up, and she came back to work. "
21090,sam,I thought you meant you didn't want to talk about it.  I'm a spokesman -- it's  in my blood.
21091,sam,We're not making fun of the host.
21092,sam,"I only wish the Speaker were here tonight, but he's held up in negotiations on the Hill.  He's demanding his latest pre-nup include a line item veto?"
21093,josh,There it is!
21094,sam,"All right! Two groups. You guys over there, we'll stay over here."
21095,sam,Why?
21096,sam,Get the Kung Pao Chicken and come back here. Let's go! In a half an hour I want to make  Toby laugh.
21097,leo,"So I found out about a year ago. Two nights before the State of the Union, he had an  attack."
21098,toby,He did?
21099,leo,When he passed out in the Oval Office.
21100,toby,That was an attack?
21101,leo,Yeah.
21102,toby,I thought it was the flu.
21103,leo,It wasn't.
21104,toby,"How is it possible? How is it possible that this was kept a secret? First of all, who  else knows?"
21105,leo,You're the 16th person.
21106,toby,Who else?
21107,leo,I'll tell you some of them. I won't tell you all of them.
21108,toby,Why not?
21109,leo,"Because it's not entirely my business. I'm not sure of my footing here. The President  will be off the phone in a minute, and in the meantime you'll take what I give you."
21110,toby,It's not entirely your business?
21111,leo,"The First Lady. The doctor, the radiologist, the specialist, the kids..."
21112,toby,Who else?
21113,leo,"That's it, for now."
21114,toby,He took a physical. Those doctors were from eight years ago. He took a physical...
21115,leo,It's in remission. It doesn't show up during a physical.
21116,toby,Leo...
21117,leo,It's in remission. Nobody lied.
21118,toby,Nobody lied?
21119,leo,Nobody.
21120,toby,Nobody lied? Is that what you've been saying to yourself over and over again...
21121,leo,Look...
21122,toby,"...for a year, Leo? A deception of massive proportion? I can't even... He gets a  physical twice a year at Bethesda. His doctors are Naval officers. Are you telling me  that officers are involved in this?"
21123,leo,Toby...
21124,toby,These guys are going to be court-martialed.
21125,leo,Nobody... Listen to me. Nobody lied. Nobody was asked to lie.
21126,toby,Coercion.
21127,leo,Nobody was asked to lie!
21128,toby,"Officers. The First Lady. Surgeons... Surgeon generals, for all I know..."
21129,bartlet," The plural of surgeon general isn't surgeon generals, it's surgeons general.  Like attorneys general, or courts martial. Nobody was asked to lie. That was Garreth from  the FAA. Upon interrogating Reda Nessam, they believe it's possible that another rental  car crossed the border yesterday. They believe it's headed to a safe house in Patterson,  New Jersey, and the FBI thinks they can apprehend him in 24 hours. Of course, the only  way all of this will happen is if Reda Nessam is telling the truth, so who wants odds?  Anyway, they're still looking at forensic evidence and we're going to talk again in a  few minutes to decide if there's a credible threat."
21130,toby,"I'm sorry, sir, I didn't hear that."
21131,bartlet,"I said, we're going to decide if there's a credible threat. Why? What are you guys  talking about?"
21132,josh,Hey.
21133,josh,You have any idea how much longer Toby’s gonna be?
21134,josh,  I’m sorry the Speaker isn’t here. He’s up on the Hill in last minute negotiations.  He’s going over his prenup and he wants a line-item veto.
21135,josh,What?
21136,josh,Why?
21137,josh, Where’s Mrs. Bartlet gonna be?
21138,josh, She’s not coming to the Correspondents' Dinner?
21139,josh," Charlie, what’s going on?"
21140,josh,Sorry.  You don’t know when Toby’s out?
21141,josh,Okay. 
21142,josh, All right... Here we go!
21143,sam,"""Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States  or any state on account of sex."""
21144,josh, What’s the joke?
21145,sam,It’s not a joke. 
21146,josh,When did that come back?
21148,sam,Shall not be abridged or denied on account of sex. Very dangerous language. This must be  stopped. What could possibly be your problem with the ERA?
21149,josh, Why are we talking about the ERA?
21150,sam,She’s doing a thing.
21151,josh,"Yeah, but it's not back or anything though, is it? "
21152,sam,"Certainly, not if Phyllis Schlafly here has her way."
21153,sam,It’s redundant?
21154,sam,How about...
21155,josh,"Alright, here’s a joke based on the premise that the party afterwards is hard to get  into and that the President is the Commander-In-Chief. ""I hear the Bloomberg party is  gonna be hard to get into this year but I’m not worried. I’m going to the party with  the 82nd Airborne."""
21157,josh,"Or ""Wow, I haven’t seen my staff update their resumes this quickly since the last time  I tanked at the Correspondents' Dinner!"" "
21159,josh,Yeah?
21161,josh,"Hey, who gave you those flowers on your desk?"
21163,josh,Sam. 
21164,sam,We’re doing fine. Toby’s gonna come in here and nail it. This is his thing.
21165,josh,"Yeah, cut the Speaker joke, okay? Mrs. Bartlet might not be there."
21166,sam,Okay.
21167,josh,"Alright, so uh... we’re gonna be fine here."
21168,sam,"No! We’re doing great!  We’re doing great everybody, right?"
21169,sam,"Yeah, we’re eating it."
21170,toby,Leo said you had an attack last year?
21171,bartlet, Hmm?
21172,toby,Leo said you had an attack last year. 
21173,bartlet,Yeah.
21174,toby,A couple of nights before the State of the Union.
21175,bartlet,Yeah.
21176,toby,Wasn’t that also the night you saw satellite pictures of India moving on Kashmir?
21177,bartlet,Yeah.
21178,toby,India and Pakistan were staring each other down. Control of some nuclear weapons had  been put in the field.
21179,bartlet,Yeah?
21180,toby,"So, in the middle of a... I don’t know what you call them..."
21181,bartlet,An episode.
21182,toby,...You were in the Situation Room as Commander-In-Chief.
21183,bartlet, I know. I can’t believe we’re all still here.
21184,toby,Mr.... 
21185,bartlet,The episode was over. Leo was with me. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs was with me as  were the Secretaries of State and Defense. 
21186,toby,Do you receive medication?
21187,bartlet,I’m sorry?
21188,toby,Do you receive medication?
21189,bartlet,I get injections of Betaseron.
21190,toby,From whom?
21191,bartlet,From a doctor.
21192,toby,"None of your current doctors are aware of your condition... Mr. President, is your wife  medicating you?"
21193,bartlet,I think it would be best while temperatures are running a little high that you refer to my  wife as Mrs. Bartlet or the First Lady.
21194,toby," Yes, sir."
21195,bartlet,"What you got, Leo?"
21196,leo,They’d like a few more minutes.
21197,bartlet,The FAA?
21198,leo,Yeah.
21199,bartlet,Talk me through what heightened security means.
21200,leo,"Well, they deploy more uniformed police and the dogs. They hand search luggage."
21201,bartlet,They discontinue...
21202,leo,Curbside checking. Eliminate the first two rows of short-term parking.
21203,bartlet,"Okay, they want a few minutes?"
21204,leo,Yeah.
21205,bartlet, Toby’s concerned that the peaceful solution I brokered in Kashmir last year  was the result of a drug-induced haze.
21206,leo," I was there with him. So was Fitz. So was Cashman, Hutchinson, Berryhill..."
21207,toby,"Well, that’s fantastic."
21208,leo,Toby!
21209,toby,None of you were elected!
21210,bartlet,"I was elected, they were appointed.  The Vice President was elected.  He has the constitutional authority to assume my..."
21211,toby,Not last May he didn’t.  He didn’t last May when you were under general anesthesia.
21212,bartlet,"That’s because I never signed the letter, but I don’t think I got shot because I got MS."
21213,toby,"I don’t think you did either, sir. I meant that during a night of extreme chaos and fear,  when we didn’t yet know if we’d been the victims of domestic or-or foreign terrorism or  even an act of war there was uncertainty as to who was giving the National Security  orders and that was because you never signed a letter! "
21214,toby,"So I'm led to wonder, given your condition and it’s lack of predictability why there  isn’t simply a signed letter sitting in a file someplace? And the answer, of course, is  that...  if there was a-a signed letter sitting in a file someplace, somebody  would ask why. "
21215,toby," And twelve hours earlier an F-117 was shot down in the no fly,  and the Vice President’s authority was murky at best! "
21216,toby,The National Security Advisor and Secretary of State didn’t know who they were taking  their orders from! I wasn’t in the Situation Room that night but I’ll bet all the money  in my pockets against all the money in your pockets that it was Leo... who no one elected!  For 90 minutes that night there was a coup d’etat in this country. 
21217,bartlet,And the walls came tumbling down. I feel fine by the way. Thanks for asking.
21218,leo,Sir...
21219,bartlet," No, Leo. Toby’s concern for my health is moving me in ways..."
21220,toby,Mr. President....
21221,bartlet, SHUT UP!
21222,bartlet, You know your indignation would be a lot more interesting to me if it  weren’t quite so covered in crap! 
21223,bartlet, Yeah.
21224,bartlet, Thanks.
21225,bartlet, Are you pissed because I didn’t say anything or are you pissed because there  were 15 people who knew before you did? I feel fine by the way. Thanks for asking.
21226,leo, Take the call in here. 
21227,leo, We’ll step outside for a minute.
21228,bartlet," Yeah, this is the President."
21229,sam,Self-deprecation.
21230,sam,Self-deprecation is what we need.
21231,sam,Self-deprecation is the appetizer of charm.
21232,sam,We need jokes about the staff.
21233,sam,Problem is there aren’t many jokes you can make about me.
21235,sam,"See, I think that was a bit of misdirected anger there."
21237,sam,"Well, in that case, Ainsley, you know why I got you flowers in April instead of February?  'Cause you ditched me the first time around to go back to the guy who ditched you the  first time around only to have him ditch you the second time around."
21238,josh,Ow! What the hell? That was him!
21240,josh,"Well, in fairness, I think everybody should have a turn. Sam, is there anything we can  pull, anything funny we can recycle?"
21241,sam,"Yeah, pull something I wrote from October called ""Government-wide Accountability for  Merit System Principles."""
21242,josh,"That one was a barn-burner, was it?"
21244,sam,How much?
21246,sam,"What does ""snark"" mean?"
21248,sam,There any coffee left?
21249,sam,Anybody want anything?
21250,sam, It’s quarter after midnight. The pastry chef usually stays on  till dawn.
21251,sam,"You know, we should make a joke about women, 'cause there's no law against that or paying  them less money than men."
21252,sam,What are you making now?
21253,sam,"So, everything's fine."
21254,sam,Look...
21255,sam,Oftentimes...
21256,sam,"Oh, goodnight nurse! They don't choose to make less money. They're financially punished  for having kids."
21257,sam,"Well, not necessarily if you guys have your way, but that's a different can of tuna.  I flat-out guarantee you that if men were biologically responsible for  procreation, there'd be paid family leave in every Fortune 500."
21258,sam,"If the Amendment’s redundant, then what's your problem if it’s passed or not?"
21259,sam,Yeah?
21260,sam,Yeah.
21261,leo,He’s still on the phone with State in the Residence.
21262,toby,So Hoynes knows?
21263,leo,Hmm?
21264,toby,Hoynes is one of the 16?
21265,leo,Yeah.
21266,toby,And he thinks the President won’t run again?
21267,leo,He thinks there’s a chance.
21268,toby,Will he?
21269,leo, Will the President run?
21270,toby,Where’s the First Lady?
21271,leo,In Manchester.
21272,toby,Why’d she come to me after the State of the Union?
21273,leo,Toby...
21274,toby,Why’s she mad at the President? It’s because the State of the Union set up the  re-election run and somehow she’s under the impression that’s not supposed to happen.
21275,leo,The First Lady...
21276,toby,I have no kind of investigative mind. Zero. It took me six days and 23 minutes to  figure it out.
21277,leo,He’ll run.
21278,toby,"Yeah, yeah ‘cause we stood in that office a couple of months ago, you and I, and you  said, ""Take my hand,"" and we just..."
21279,toby,Never mind.
21280,leo,He’ll run.
21281,toby,Hoynes was fourteen. Who was fifteen?
21282,leo,Dr. David Lee. The anesthesiologist at GW. He had to know about the Betaseron.  Getting back to Hoynes...
21283,toby,"I’m sorry, Leo, but I need you to look at me right now and tell me the doctor’s not  under some kind of surveillance."
21284,leo,The doctor’s free to talk to whomever he likes.
21285,toby,"Well, I’m sure we’re gonna find that out soon enough."
21286,leo,He’s not gonna leak it.
21287,toby,Someone will.
21288,leo,Toby...
21289,toby,"Leo, Hoynes left bread crumbs. He wanted me to find out. A camping trip to Killington?"
21290,leo,That was a jackass move.
21291,toby,I don’t think it was. I think he may be the only one around here who’s acting responsibly.
21292,leo,To who?
21293,toby,"The Democratic Party. Seven and a half months to the Iowa caucus, and no one's been told  the President might not be the nominee!"
21294,leo,He’s gonna run!
21295,toby,"No, he may not have that option, Leo."
21296,leo,"When this story breaks, it’ll be because we broke it, and we'll control it. And the  public will accept it. It’s not like it’s unprecedented that a President conceal health  issues.  What do you think is gonna happen? I mean it. What do you think is going  to happen?"
21297,toby," Well, I suppose one of five things.  The President can decide not to run. He can run and not win. He can run and win."
21298,leo,And? What are the other two?
21299,toby,Leo...
21300,leo,You think he’s gonna need to resign?
21301,toby,There’s gonna be hearing upon hearing upon hearing.
21302,leo,He hasn't broken a law.
21303,leo,Thanks.
21304,toby,Says you.  You don't have to break the law to get served with articles of  impeachment.
21305,leo,"Toby, it is never gonna get that far."
21306,toby, Write down the exact date and time you said that.
21309,sam,"We got the coffee but then I spilled it coming up the stairs, you know, the first  couple of times. Where’s Josh?"
21311,sam,"For how long? I’ve had time to spill coffee, you know, a lot."
21313,sam,"So, guys..."
21314,sam,"When I was downstairs, I made a decision. I’m gonna register with the Republican Party,  and I’ll tell you why, if you’re curious. It’s because they’re a freedom-loving people."
21315,sam,"You know, you insist government is depraved for not legislating against what we can see  on the newsstands, or what we can see in an art exhibit, or what we can burn in protest,  or which sex we’re allowed to have sex with, or a woman’s right to choose, but don't you  dare try to regulate this deadly weapon I have concealed on me, for that would encroach  against my freedom."
21316,sam,We believe in the ERA.
21317,sam,How can you have an objection to something that says...?
21318,sam," I could've countered that, but I’d already moved on to other things  in my head."
21320,josh,Oh!
21321,josh,"Well, that was predictable."
21323,josh,I’m trying to find that speech Sam said.
21325,josh,"Well, yeah, sure, I suppose."
21327,josh,Right.
21329,josh,Yes?
21331,josh,What the hell is happening now?
21333,josh,"Hey, I’m just grateful we were your last choice."
21335,josh,"Donna, if you’ve got your old Catholic-school uniform on under there, don’t get me  wrong, I applaud the thought, but..."
21337,josh,Okay.
21339,josh,Yeah.
21341,josh,Yeah. You know why? ‘Cause you didn’t put down the kitty litter.
21343,josh,You were in a car accident?
21345,josh,"Seriously, you were in an accident?"
21347,josh,You told me it was a late thaw.
21349,josh, He stopped on the way to the hospital for a beer?
21351,josh,Donna...
21353,josh,No.
21355,josh,I’m not gonna make fun of him.
21357,josh,But just what kind of a dumbkes were you...
21359,josh,And had a beer?
21362,josh,"I’m just sayin’ if you were in an accident, I wouldn’t stop for a beer."
21364,toby,Why not heighten security?
21365,leo,Hmm?
21366,toby,At the airports. Why not heighten security? What’s the downside?
21367,bartlet, Sorry about that.
21368,leo,What’s going on?
21369,bartlet,Charlie!  I’ve got to make the call.
21370,bartlet,Let’s get Garreth back.
21371,leo,Toby was just asking what the downside of going to a security condition was.
21372,bartlet,The scanners they use take an hour to search the luggage of 250 passengers. The condition  requires two photo IDs. Most people only have one. Delays. Delays are the downside.
21373,bartlet,That timed out well.
21374,bartlet, I didn't know enough.
21375,toby,I know the feeling.
21376,bartlet," I have no intention of apologizing to you, Toby."
21377,toby,Would you mind if I ask why not?
21378,bartlet,"‘Cause you’re not the one with MS, a wife, three kids and airports to close. Not every  part of me belongs to you. This was personal. I’m not willing to relinquish that right."
21379,toby,"It will appear to many, if not most, as fraud. It will appear as if you denied the voters  an opportunity to decide for themselves. They’re generally not willing to relinquish that  right, either."
21380,bartlet,Yeah.
21381,toby,"Mr. President, at some point in the near future, we’re going to have to speak to some  lawyers."
21382,bartlet,"Well, that’s what usually brings on the episodes, but if you say so."
21383,toby," It's 17 people, by the way."
21384,bartlet,I'm sorry?
21385,toby,You knew. We weren’t counting you. It’s 17 people.
21386,bartlet,I don’t know.  It may have been unbelievably stupid. It may have  been unthinkably stupid. I don’t know. 
21387,bartlet,I’m sorry. I really am.
21388,toby,I’ve gotta go in the other room and uh...
21389,bartlet,Yeah. I’ll see you tomorrow. Thanks.
21390,toby,"Thank you, Mr. President."
21391,toby, Okay.
21392,bartlet,"I couldn't disagree more, Cal. As long as these people are funding their public school  districts with property taxes, neither the value of the schools nor the value of their  property is going to go up. It's a vicious circle. It's terrible and it has to be stopped. "
21393,bartlet,I wouldn't go that far. Anything else? 
21394,bartlet,Thank you.
21395,leo,Mr. President. 
21396,bartlet,"It's a vicious circle, Leo. "
21397,leo,Yeah. 
21398,bartlet,It never stops. 
21399,leo,Sir... 
21400,bartlet,It just goes round and round... 
21401,leo,Look... 
21402,bartlet,...and round and round. 
21403,leo,Let's go see him. 
21404,bartlet,Now? 
21405,leo,He's waiting for us. 
21406,bartlet,We really need to see him now? 
21407,leo,What better time? 
21408,bartlet,Well... later. 
21409,leo,Let's go.
21410,bartlet,"Five White House Counsels in two and a half years. Cochran, Gates, Solomon, Tribbey.  Why can't I keep a head lawyer around here? "
21411,leo,'Cause they all show up thinking they're going to be a counselor to the President and  you never let them in. 
21412,bartlet,I don't like new people. 
21413,leo,Oliver Babish isn't a new person. You know each other. Your kids know each other.  You built hospitals together. He was Midwest Finance Chairman on the campaign. 
21414,bartlet,"Never played chess, though, have we? "
21415,leo,No. 
21416,bartlet,See? 
21417,leo,You're scared of Babish. 
21418,bartlet,"Oh, like you're not. "
21419,leo,"No, because we are both men of Chicago. "
21420,bartlet,"What is it with people from Chicago that they're so happy to have been born there?  I meet so many people who can't wait to tell me they're from Chicago, and when I  meet them, they're living anywhere but Chicago. "
21421,leo,You wouldn't understand. 
21422,bartlet,He looks down his nose at me 'cause I'm not a lawyer. 
21423,leo,Yes. 
21424,bartlet,I didn't go to law school. I got a Ph.D. in economics instead. 
21425,leo,Your parents were very proud. 
21426,bartlet,"Yeah, and all that happened was I won a Nobel Prize and got elected President so I guess  that decision didn't really pay off. "
21427,leo,Yeah. 
21428,bartlet,Should I run back and get my Nobel Prize? 
21429,leo,I think he knows you've got one.
21430,bartlet,Guy's been here three months he's got a nicer office than I do. 
21431,leo,He's got a nicer office than I do. 
21432,bartlet,That matters less to me. 
21433,bartlet,"Hey, Oliver. "
21434,bartlet,What are the bags for? 
21435,bartlet,"Oh... oh, gosh. Oliver, this... "
21436,leo,Sir... 
21437,bartlet,...this can keep... 
21438,leo,Mr. President... 
21439,bartlet,The man's bags are packed. Where are you going? 
21440,bartlet,Asia's best-kept secret. 
21441,bartlet,It's really not even... I don't want you to worry that much about it. 
21442,leo,Sir... 
21443,bartlet, I'm easing in. 
21444,leo,Okay. 
21445,bartlet,"Well, Oliver, it really boils down to this I'm going to tell you a story and then  I need you to tell me whether or not I've engaged 16 people in a massive criminal  conspiracy to defraud the public in order to win a Presidential election. "
21446,josh,"Finance, Foreign Relations, Senate Banking, I guess. Leo's in a meeting. Someone's going  to call you every half-hour. Yeah. "
21448,josh,"Yeah, can you believe it? "
21450,josh,"No, actually just this morning. "
21452,josh,By noT slowly devaluing the peso the way I told them to. 
21454,josh,"The Treasury Secretary did, but I was in the room. "
21456,josh,"Seriously, they're in big trouble. Three weeks ago, they fell to 20 cents against the  dollar. Two weeks ago, the Bolsa Index took its worst single day fall in history and  this morning the Mexican market opened 20 percent off THE Friday close. "
21458,josh,It'd be like a 2000 point drop in the Dow. The immediate problem... 
21459,josh,"I saw it two hours ago, Toby. Where you been? "
21460,toby,I just got here. 
21461,josh,We could be screwed on vouchers. 
21462,toby,"We are screwed on vouchers, but I want to know... "
21463,josh,Talk to C.J. 
21464,toby,Somebody's going to eat this quote! 
21466,josh,"Yeah, I can't worry about it right now. "
21468,josh,"Mexico's got 30 billion dollars worth of foreign loans due this week, and they don't  have 30 billion dollars. "
21470,josh," Oh-oh, the Wells Fargo wagon is a'coming down the street. "
21471,josh,"Buenos dias, señores y señoras. "
21472,josh,Let's find some money. 
21473,c.j.,"I've seen it, obviously. I just haven't spoken to the President about it. "
21474,c.j.,The President hasn't turned around. 
21475,c.j.,"It sounds like the senior White House official would be willing to compromise, but I  haven't spoken to the President yet this morning. If I could move off the quote for a  moment. This is from the Coast Guard Marine Safety and Environmental Protection Division.  About three hours ago a single-hull VLCC carrying four million gallons of crude oil ran  up on a shoal three miles south of Rahobeth Beach, Delaware. "
21476,c.j.,"Whoa, whoa, I don't have much. I'm going to give you everything I've got. The hull was  punctured and the tanker is leaking oil. "
21477,c.j.,"200,000 gallons so far. "
21478,c.j.,"The Coast Guard has deployed containment booms around the vessel, and they're siphoning  oil... "
21479,sam,"Bonnie, what happpened? "
21480,sam,The oil tanker.
21481,sam,"Ginger, what do you know about the oil tanker? "
21482,sam,I'm amazed it found Delaware. 
21483,c.j.,The Federal on-scene coordinator scheduled a press conference for 2:00 this afternoon  from the Coast Guard Incident Command Post. We hope to have much more information by  then. 
21484,c.j.,"Thank you, everybody. "
21485,toby,"What the hell, C.J.? "
21486,c.j.,Anything good in the paper this morning? 
21487,toby,Who's the senior White House official? 
21488,c.j.,I don't know. 
21489,toby,Are you telling me you can't can't control...  A reporter can just  pick up the phone and call anyone? 
21490,c.j.,Yeah. 
21491,toby,Why? 
21492,c.j.,'Cause we don't live in Tripoli. 
21493,toby,"The Republican leaders are already think... Shallick, Ann Stark, they already think they  can get the votes on a compromised measure. "
21494,c.j.,Look... 
21495,toby," All they were scared of was a veto. They're going to build it  now. They're going to do it. And our phones, all day long, are going to be ringing with  Democrats who want us dead. Seth Gillette's going to... Let me tell you something --  this time, he's going to be right! "
21496,c.j.,"Toby, I'll talk to Leo and Josh. I'll talk to the President. I'll get a clarification.  Beyond that, what do you want me to do? "
21497,toby,I want you to find out who the senior White House official was and  put his ass  in my office by the end of the day! 
21498,sam,It wasn't me. 
21499,c.j.,I imagine if it was anyone within the sound of Toby's voice they'd be looking for a  trapdoor right now. 
21500,sam,Is there anything you can tell me about the tanker? 
21501,c.j.,Carol's going to give you the notes from the Coast Guard. 
21502,sam,Do you know whether it had something to do with the navigation or the steering? 
21503,c.j.,"Well, all that's being investigated, but I'm assuming that when a ship runs into the  shore it has something to do with either the navigation or the steering. "
21504,sam,Yeah.  
21505,c.j.,"Hey Sam... you don't know who it was, right? "
21506,sam,No. 
21507,bartlet,Not as much as a doctor. You should talk to a doctor. 
21508,bartlet,"I think what you're asking is, is it possible I could be sitting in the Situation Room,  have an attack, and nobody knows it. "
21509,bartlet,Yes. My vision might get blurry. You wouldn't know that. My legs might get numb...
21510,bartlet,What's that? 
21511,bartlet, What's he talking about? 
21512,leo,He's a government lawyer. The privilege doesn't exist. 
21513,bartlet,I don't want to be careful about what I say in this room. 
21514,bartlet,"I want you. I meant, I don't need to be careful. "
21515,bartlet,Yeah. 
21516,bartlet,Have I ever been party to a lawsuit? 
21517,bartlet,I was governor of New Hampshire. Anybody who... 
21518,bartlet, A meter reader slipped on a patch of black ice in my driveway and I got  dragged into some pain-in-the-ass thing over my great-aunt's will. 
21519,bartlet,Yeah. 
21520,bartlet,"Oliver, why are we talking about my great-aunt's will and the meter reader? "
21521,leo,He never lied. 
21522,bartlet, I never lied. 
21523,bartlet,No. 
21524,bartlet,No. 
21525,leo,And the anesthesiologist at GW. 
21526,bartlet,I'm sorry? 
21527,leo,Toby Ziegler. 
21528,bartlet,Yeah. 
21529,leo,This past Friday night. 
21530,leo,Not well. 
21531,bartlet,"Well, the Mexican economy crashed, an oil tanker busted up about 120 miles from here and  13 percent of Americans are living in poverty. So yeah, I can hang out with you and  answer insulting questions for awhile. "
21532,josh,Treasury's getting it into legislative language right now. The Assistant Secretary for  Legislative Affairs... 
21533,josh,Yes. Says she'll have it for us in an hour to review it. That's when the President's  going to call you and ask you to fast track it. He wants you to take it straight to  mark-up and vote. 
21534,josh,"We understand, but we don't have a day. "
21535,josh,"Yeah, listen. Uh, the next story in the news cycle has got to be that the U.S. is  guaranteeing the loans. "
21536,josh,The President doesn't mind staying up late to sign his name. 
21537,josh,I noticed that.
21538,josh,Not at all. You mind talking fast? 
21539,josh,Shout to somebody if you need coffee. 
21540,c.j.,How's it going in there? 
21541,josh,The number of people whose permission I need before I can do whatever the hell I want...  Let me tell you something. There's really a lot to be said for fascism. 
21542,c.j.,Funny you should mention that. 
21543,josh,Toby? 
21544,c.j.,He wants me to find the leak. 
21545,josh,You should. 
21546,c.j.,No problem. Was it you? 
21547,josh,No. 
21548,c.j.,"Okay. Well, then, now I'm stumped. "
21549,c.j.,"Josh, when there's a leak, I do what I do. Finding the person is usually impossible  under benign circumstances but with Toby blasting around the halls whoever it was has  gone so far underground we could start our search in Beijing. "
21550,josh,What about asking Cashin? 
21551,c.j.,Cashin isn't going to roll over on a source. 
21552,josh,Then you've got to get a swinging light bulb in there and just do it. 
21553,c.j.,"Yeah, this from the guy who had four kinds of aneurysms when he had to interrogate the  staff on drug use. "
21554,josh,That was a lot different. 
21555,c.j.,'Cause it was you? 
21556,josh,"No, because that was an investigation into personal behavior. This guy compromised a  policy initiative. "
21557,c.j.,"That's a fair point, and I'm not saying it's not bad I'm just saying I'm not going to  find him. "
21558,josh,You're absolutely not going to find him.
21559,c.j.,But I should spend the day doing it anyway. 
21560,josh,Yes. 
21561,c.j.,Because Toby's pissed. 
21562,josh,"Hey, you know what? I've found that if you accept that as a good enough reason for  doing something, life becomes easier. "
21563,c.j.,Thank you for the fortune cookie wisdom. 
21564,josh,You bet. 
21566,josh,"You just lurk there in the shadows, like... "
21568,josh,What are you doing? 
21570,josh,Can you do them later? 
21572,josh,So you're not doing them now? 
21574,josh,About what? 
21576,josh,Can you ask them later? 
21578,josh,"Okay, it's going to be one of these now, right? "
21580,josh,You object to the bailout? 
21582,josh,Because in the world of Donnatella Moss we should all love one another just as long  as it doesn't cost you anything. 
21584,josh, Close the door. 
21585,josh,Donna? 
21587,josh,Thank you.
21588,sam,Hey. 
21589,sam,Is he back yet? 
21590,sam,"Hey, you decided yet? "
21591,sam,Why? 
21592,sam,What happened to molecular biology? 
21593,sam,How many AP credits do you have from high school? 
21594,sam,"You're telling me you've never been to college and after taking two classes this summer  you're going to be, like, a junior? "
21595,sam,"Charlie, just how smart are you? "
21596,sam,She's here? 
21597,sam,Thanks.
21598,sam,Lieutenant? 
21599,sam,Sam. 
21600,sam,You look exactly the way you sound on the phone. 
21601,sam,Thanks for coming by. 
21602,sam,I'm surprised to see you in a dress uniform on a day like you must be having today. 
21603,sam,I never knew that. 
21604,sam,I'm less visually observant than others but I make up for it. 
21605,sam,With cunning and guile. 
21606,sam,What happened to the ship? 
21607,sam,"If he dropped anchor ten miles out, what's he doing here? "
21608,sam,The anchor broke? 
21609,sam,Anchors break? 
21610,sam,"I don't know. A couple football fields, probably. "
21611,sam,Six miles? 
21612,sam,"Okay, so the thing's drifting out there... "
21613,sam,What happened to the Tallahassee? 
21614,sam,So it made for port. 
21615,sam,But the wind from the northeast... 
21616,sam,...pushed the Indio into shore. How bad is this going to end up being? 
21617,sam,"Yeah. Listen, thanks again for coming by."
21618,sam,I'd appreciate it. Good luck. 
21619,bartlet,No. 
21620,bartlet,"I have accidental death insurance as well as considerable personal worth. Were I to die,  my family would not miss my government salary. "
21621,bartlet,I don't have any anymore. 
21622,bartlet,"I'm the husband of a doctor and as a Governor and President, the various governments  I've led generously... "
21623,bartlet,No. 
21624,leo,You should probably make the call. 
21625,bartlet,Yeah. Excuse me.
21626,leo,What do you think? 
21627,c.j.,"No, but yes."
21628,c.j.,"Hey, Jamie, how are you doing? "
21629,c.j.,I know how you feel. 
21630,c.j.,"Yes, and I'd like to ask you some questions. "
21631,c.j.,There was a meeting about vouchers in the Roosevelt Room last Thursday. Were you part  of it?
21632,c.j.,"Right, and have you talked to Terry Cashin of the Baltimore Sun in the last four days? "
21633,c.j.,"I was wondering, if in the last four days... "
21634,c.j.,I was going to be a little more circumspect. 
21635,c.j.,Jamie... 
21636,c.j.,And frankly -- and I don't say this to you enough -- doing a very good job. 
21637,c.j.,Do you happen to know who the leak is? 
21638,c.j.,"No, no, we wrapped that up tight. "
21639,c.j.,Carol? 
21640,c.j.,How many more of these do I have? 
21641,c.j.,"Okay, after five of them, I'm just going to confess. "
21642,c.j.,Sure. 
21643,josh,They're not done meeting yet? 
21645,josh,Yeah. 
21647,josh,Okay. 
21649,josh,From who? 
21651,josh,Who's he? 
21653,josh,Does he want me to call back? 
21655,josh,"No, why don't you call him back? Why don't you call him back and remind him that the  Mexican consumers who buy his textiles can't afford to buy them anymore. Frank will be  laid off. Which isn't a problem there are plenty of jobs out there for a 48-year-old  textiles worker just as long as he's trained in high-tech computers and/or medical  research. "
21657,josh,"Eventually it does. And we're not giving them the money, we're giving them our credit  card and paying the bill. It's a loan. We did the same thing six years ago -- the loan  was paid back ahead of schedule. "
21659,josh,Yes. 
21661,josh,Yes. 
21663,josh,"Well, not right here in front of everybody, Donna, but if you want to run home and get  your equipment... "
21665,josh,"The telemarketing was a nice detail but you should've said, ""scrubbed floors."" "
21667,josh,"Yeah, probably. "
21668,sam,Hey. 
21669,sam,You did some decorating. 
21670,sam,A woman's touch. 
21671,sam,"Hang on, I know this piece of music. I love it. "
21672,sam,"No, but there's a reason I like it. "
21673,sam,"But there's another reason, hang on. "
21674,sam,Yes. Thank you.
21675,sam,A lawyer. 
21676,sam,Seriously. 
21677,sam,"No, I'm not. I just want to ask you some questions. You've been covering the Attorneys  General for Maryland and Delaware this morning, right? "
21678,sam,Yeah. 
21679,sam,How much? 
21680,sam,"No, they're not. "
21681,sam,Somebody's going to pay. It's not going to be them. 
21682,sam,I do.
21683,sam,'Cause I'm the one who bought them the boat. I bought the Indio for them when I was at  Gage Whitney. 
21684,sam,"Yeah, but what I was thinking was this. I know this is going to sound crazy but I was  thinking, if I could be deposed for the plaintiffs... "
21685,sam,"Because... Look, I was very proud of myself for making such a great deal and it really  sealed it for me with the partners and they were about to make me one. And it really  didn't bother me that the boat was cheap for a reason. But then, at the 11th hour,  I had a change of heart. For whatever reason, I had a change of heart and I told them  the boat wasn't good enough, particularly with regards to the steering and navigation  systems, which, of course, they already knew, and I suggested they spend more money,  and they said... "
21686,sam,$11 million extra dollars. 
21687,sam,They laughed me out of the room. 
21688,sam,"Ainsley, unless a company like this is forced to fork over so much money they don't want  to go on living -- unless they're compelled to pay $500 million -- there's no incentive  for them to pay the extra 11 million to make the boat safer. "
21689,sam,All right. It was just an idea. 
21690,sam,"Yeah, I am. "
21691,leo,"You're a little pissy too, there, my friend. "
21692,leo,No kidding. 
21693,leo,"I was, but then I remembered. "
21694,leo,"That I'm a drunk, and he didn't give a damn. "
21695,leo,I don't know. What do you think? 
21696,leo,"Well, I think you're about to be one of them. "
21697,leo,You're staying. 
21698,leo,"'Cause I'm running this show, and I picked you. I didn't bring you here for amicus briefs. "
21699,leo,"I mean, in the two and a half hours we've been sitting here have you discovered one thing  that he's done wrong? "
21700,leo,"So, what's your problem? "
21701,leo,I can't right now. It'll have to wait. 
21702,leo,I'll be right back. 
21703,leo,What is it?  Charlie... 
21704,leo,What are you...? 
21705,leo,God.  Charlie... 
21706,leo, Okay. 
21707,leo,"No, it's okay. "
21708,leo,You absolutely did the right thing.  Okay. Go back to work. 
21709,leo,Margaret? 
21710,leo,I need to see all of Zoey Bartlet's Admissions paperwork for Georgetown. 
21711,leo,"No, you call Pat Carr, the family lawyer and you tell him I want it. "
21712,leo,"Margaret, just get it right now, would you? "
21713,c.j.,"And Josh was in the Roosevelt Room meeting last Thursday, right? "
21715,c.j.,And do you recall him talking to you about what went on? 
21717,c.j.,It's important. 
21719,c.j.,'Cause somebody might've overheard you talking to him. 
21721,c.j.,Are you okay? 
21723,c.j.,"And... and you yourself didn't talk to anybody, did you? "
21724,c.j.,Donna? 
21726,c.j.,What? 
21728,c.j.,Are you saying it was you? 
21730,c.j.,"No, it's okay. "
21732,c.j.,Why? 
21734,c.j., What are you talking about? 
21736,c.j., What do you mean?
21738,c.j.,Why? 
21741,c.j.,Get out! 
21743,c.j.,Get out! 
21745,c.j.,Thanks. 
21746,c.j.,Carol! 
21747,josh,Did you confess? 
21749,josh,You got a phone call while you were in there. 
21751,josh,Europe in 1939. 
21753,josh,"Yeah, I jotted it down. Apparently they're at war, but we've taken a firm stand as an  isolationist nation and refused to get involved. Our resources are our own and their  problems are on the other side of the world. Though, they do have problems. It sounds  to me from what they said on the phone that France, Austria, and England are getting  absolutely pounded by the Germans, and with no end in sight. They say that by 1941  they're gonna desperately need our help if they have any chance of survival. But I think  they're just being hysterical. This son of a customs agent with the Charlie Chaplin  mustache ain't going anywhere. But there's no telling that to Franklin Roosevelt, who's  trying to convince his country they need to get involved. That's why he came up with this. "
21755,josh,Turn to the page I flagged. 
21757,josh,"Yeah. Simply put, a loan of arms to Russia and Britain, with the understanding that  they'd pay us back when the war was over. And he said this, he said, ""If your neighbor's  house is on fire, you don't haggle over the price of your garden hose."" Frank Kelly in  South Carolina wouldn't... There are too many things in the world we can't do. Mexico's  on fire. Why help them? Because we can. "
21759,josh,Yeah. 
21761,c.j.,Everyone hates me. 
21762,c.j.,You think? 
21763,c.j.,That's exactly right. 
21764,c.j.,You're the first one who's understood that. 
21765,c.j.,Sure. 
21766,c.j.,"All right, that's it!  "
21767,c.j.,Shut up!  
21768,sam,"720,000 gallons covering close to 100 square miles. 10,000 blue and horseshoe crabs are  dead, so that's a $25 million dollar industry that can start looking for jobs at the  local Dairy Queen. 12,500 starfish, flounder and bass. $342 million estimated lost to the  tourism economy based on beach communities. You ever wonder why you never hear anything  about a boatload of Honda Civics spilling into the ocean? "
21769,toby,What? 
21770,sam,Were you listening? 
21771,toby,"Yeah... No. I'm sorry, no."
21772,c.j.,"Excuse me, Sam, would you mind? "
21773,sam,No. 
21774,c.j.,"It's me, okay? I am Spartacus. "
21775,toby,Look... 
21776,c.j.,"It was a leak. Leaks happen. They've happened since the beginning of time. In this  White House, in every White House. There's no malicious intent. Things get out.  It's a company town. Everybody talks to everybody, and junior staffers try to impress  reporters by showing they're in the know. There is no group of people this large in  the world that can keep a secret. I find it comforting. It's how I know for sure the  government isn't covering up aliens in New Mexico.  Toby, I've issued a blanket  email to 1,100 staffers about the incident. I've asked the President to let me make a  clarification for tomorrow morning. I've seen to it it'll be on page one. We're not  gonna lose an inch of ground in the negotiation. "
21777,toby," No, we're not."
21778,c.j.,"No, we're not. And you knew that since this morning. "
21779,toby,"Yes, I did. "
21780,c.j.,Yeah. So what's this about? 
21781,toby,"This is small potatoes. I want to know, when the big potatoes come, are we up for it? "
21782,c.j.,"Big potatoes? Toby, we ran for election. We lived through Leo and booze, Sam and  prostitutes, India and Pakistan, Colombia and a failed rescue mission. Are there  bigger potatoes someplace? "
21783,toby, No.
21784,c.j., Toby?
21785,toby,Yeah?
21786,c.j.,Why are you lying to me? 
21787,toby,I'm not.   It was... 
21788,toby,Thanks. 
21789,bartlet,Sit down. Don't be scared. 
21790,bartlet,My youngest daughter's got a big mouth. 
21791,bartlet,"We won't discuss this any more for the time being. It'll be public soon enough. And the  more conversations you have with me, the more lawyers you're gonna have to talk to, and  they bill in an hour what you take home in a week, so we won't discuss it except to say  this. You're gonna be subpoenaed. I'm confident in your loyalty to me. I'm confident in  your love for me. If you lie to protect me, if you lie just once, if you lie just a  little, if you lie 'cause you can't stand what's happening to me and the people making  it happen, if you ever, ever lie... "
21792,bartlet,"...you're finished with me, you understand? "
21793,bartlet,Say you understand. 
21794,bartlet,Go back to work. 
21795,bartlet, I need you to go to law school and graduate as soon as humanly possible. 
21796,bartlet,"Well, I've got good news for you, Oliver. Turns out I didn't do everything right after  all. Zoey had to fill out a family history form for Georgetown and because she was 17,  a parent had to sign it."
21797,bartlet,Yeah. 
21798,bartlet,"I'd give anything if I had. It was Lady Macbeth.  There's a bad moon rising,  Oliver. We both know it. They're gonna take me out for a walk. "
21799,bartlet,"This isn't what you signed up for. Leo begged you to take this job. This isn't what you  signed up for. If you leave, I'd appreciate it if you did it now, so it doesn't look  like my lawyer bailed on me when the rain starts. No one's gonna hold it against you. "
21800,bartlet,I guess it depends. 
21801,bartlet,What would my first step be? 
21802,bartlet,Yeah. 
21803,bartlet,Yeah. 
21804,bartlet, Bring it on. 
21805,c.j.,Good morning.
21806,c.j.,I really don’t know.
21807,c.j.,I really wasn’t paying that much attention.
21808,c.j.,I walked from my office to your office.
21809,c.j.,"Not at 5:30 in the morning, no."
21810,c.j.,Last night when Leo told me.
21811,c.j.,Nobody.
21812,c.j.,No.
21813,c.j., Should I have my lawyer here?
21814,c.j.,You’re the President’s lawyer.
21815,c.j.,When did he tell you?
21816,c.j.,When did the President tell you?
21817,c.j.,And Josh?
21818,c.j.,Toby?
21819,c.j.,And Leo he told more than a year ago.
21820,c.j.,"And I’ve had this for six hours now, so maybe giving me some room wouldn’t be totally  out of line. You know what I’m saying, Oliver?"
21821,c.j.,I don’t know you.
21822,c.j.,I was told to report to you. I don’t know you. You’ve been here what...?
21823,c.j.,"Three months, so why should I trust you?"
21824,c.j.,Imagine my shock.
21825,c.j.,"I think this is going really well so far, Oliver. It’s almost hard to believe that four  different women have sued you for divorce. "
21826,c.j.,Either to you or...?
21827,c.j.,Compelled by...?
21828,c.j.," Well, I have to tell you it’ll be the first time I’ve been asked out  in quite awhile, so..."
21829,c.j., That much has sunk in in the last six hours. 
21830,c.j.,Yes.
21831,c.j., What was the question?
21832,c.j.," Many, many times."
21847,toby,"All right, hear me out on this, okay?"
21848,leo,Yeah.
21849,toby,We want to see some polling.
21850,leo,Why?
21851,toby,‘Cause we need to know what to do next.
21852,leo,We know what to do next.
21853,toby,"No, we don’t know which is the more insurmountable problem - the perception that... "
21854,leo, We’ll call back.
21855,toby, ... the perception that he’s not physically up to the job or that he lied  about it.
21856,leo,There’s no way to gauge public opinion on this until the issue occurs. Public opinion is  gonna be shaped by the reaction of the press.
21857,josh,"All public opinion’s shaped by the reaction of the press, but the fundamental foundation  already exists in their current perception that the President..."
21858,leo,"Josh, how are you gonna take a poll without...?"
21859,josh,We can do it.
21860,leo,Look...
21861,toby,Leo.
21862,leo,"I don’t’ trust any of our people, and even if I did, what kind of questions could they  ask that won’t trip an alarm?"
21863,toby,Josh trusts Joey Lucas.
21864,leo,From California?
21865,josh,"Yes, she’s flying in right now."
21866,leo,What did you tell her?
21867,josh,I told her we were commissioning a poll to explore attitudes towards subsurface  agricultural products.
21868,leo,Subsurface agricultural... what the hell...?
21869,josh,Underground. We think Americans are eating more beets.
21870,leo,Beets?
21871,josh,Yeah.
21872,leo,All right.
21873,josh,Okay?
21874,leo,"Yeah. Toby, you want to talk about when we tell Sam?"
21875,toby,I wouldn’t do it right now.
21876,leo,Why?
21877,toby,His head is in the SME speech for Chicago...
21878,josh,The thing...
21879,toby,Hang on. His head is in Chicago and that’s where we need him. Would you want to write a  speech with this other thing around your neck?
21880,josh,No.
21881,leo,The President wants him to know by the end of the day.
21882,toby,"The end of the day, then."
21883,leo,Okay. Anything else?
21884,toby,No. Thanks.
21885,leo,Thank you.
21886,josh,Thanks. 
21887,toby,When does she get here?
21888,josh,Six o’clock.
21889,toby,We do this carefully.
21890,josh,No kidding.
21891,toby,You trust this person?
21892,josh, I gotta trust somebody right now.
21893,toby,"Good, ‘cause I don’t trust anybody right now. "
21894,josh, Yeah.
21896,josh,What are you telling me for?
21898,josh,Yeah.
21900,josh,Like what?
21902,josh,Sound the alarm?
21904,josh,There’s really not. 
21905,josh,Martin?
21906,josh,Sorry to keep you waiting.
21907,josh,Come on back.
21909,josh,"The fax is for the press office, give it to them."
21911,josh,"Uh, Martin, you can have a seat in my office.  C.J. is meeting with  Babish. I’ll be inside. "
21913,josh,No.
21914,josh,I apologize again.
21915,josh," I don’t, actually."
21916,josh, I have a call to return to Mac.
21917,josh,Why don’t you talk to me now?
21918,josh,Which case?
21919,josh,You’re kidding me!
21920,josh,"Martin, we spent 13 million the first year, 23 million the second... Where’s the money  going?"
21921,josh,Yeah.
21922,josh,Aren’t you allowed to transfer funds...
21923,josh,Yeah.
21924,josh,"Yeah, let me run it by Leo."
21925,josh,You don’t have to convince me.
21926,josh,I’m sorry?
21927,josh, The... tobacco companies.
21928,josh,"Well, I’m... gonna talk to Leo and I’ll tell Mac you were here."
21929,c.j.,What was that? March of last year?
21930,c.j.,I’d have to go back and check.
21931,c.j.,"If that was March of last year, then that was his fourth physical, then there were a  couple of times during the campaign, and after the shooting..."
21932,c.j.,And the time he rode his bicycle into a tree.
21933,c.j.,Yeah.
21934,c.j.,What do you mean?
21935,c.j.,"The President’s physician - right now it’s Admiral Leonard Morrow - the President's  physician calls me, gives me a short statement including vitals."
21936,c.j.,Yeah.
21937,c.j.,Yes.
21938,c.j.,"Because of doctor-patient confidentiality, there’s only so much you’re gonna get from the  doctors."
21939,c.j.,"I say, is there anything I should know about your health that the doctors won’t tell me."
21940,c.j.,What?
21941,c.j.,What does it matter?
21942,c.j.,What does it matter?
21943,c.j.,It’s an expression.
21944,c.j.,"I really don’t remember, I don’t. I don’t choose my words that carefully."
21945,c.j.,You think I was speaking to the President in code?
21946,c.j.,Thanks. 
21947,c.j.,The sky is falling down.
21948,sam,"""The debate over a tax cut - whether to have one or not, how large it should be, how  small it should be, what share should be received by whom - all of this, my friends, is  the wrong debate at the wrong time over the wrong issue."" Yes. We need to get back to  fundamentals."
21949,sam,Where is what?
21950,sam,It’s not in the speech. I’m saying it. We need to get back to fundamentals.
21951,sam,Excuse me. Think about fundamentals.
21952,sam,Yeah.
21953,sam,There’s a front-page story tomorrow I don’t know about yet?
21954,sam,"But I’m gonna know about it now, right?"
21955,sam,They’re projecting it down?
21956,sam,We don’t have as much money as we thought?
21957,sam,That’s great news.
21958,sam,It’s not great news that we have less money. I’m saying...
21959,sam,’Cause the floor fight’s gonna be easier.
21960,sam,How much less money?
21961,sam,That is great.
21962,sam,It’s not great that we have less...
21963,sam,I can’t even tell you how much this helps. I’m drafting the SME speech for Chicago and  I could really...
21964,sam," No, I don’t think so."
21965,sam,"No, no, no."
21966,sam,"Well, for one thing, it’s very bad writing."
21967,sam,The poetry’s not my problem.
21968,sam,"Well, tell them to do their own speech. This one’s for the President."
21969,sam,No.
21970,sam,We have less money?
21971,sam,"Yes, it is. Thanks."
21972,c.j.,I am now.
21973,c.j.,I was outside the room.
21974,c.j.,Yes.
21975,c.j.,The sound of a Stueben glass pitcher crashing to the floor.
21976,c.j.,I didn’t know.
21977,c.j.,"Well, at first glance, I thought he might have a virus contracted from a rare African  tsetse fly, possibly tropical sprue. I’m not an expert, but I did meet a man once in  India."
21978,c.j.,It could be anything with these Presidents. James Polk had diverticulitis.
21979,c.j.,"Couldn’t digest nuts. I’ll tell you what else. One in 40 American men wear women’s  clothing, and we’ve had well over forty Presidents."
21980,c.j.,"I’m just sayin’, one of these guys was dancing around the Oval Office in a prom dress.  Now let’s get to the bottom of that."
21981,c.j.,Yeah?
21982,c.j., Really?
21983,c.j.,Yes.
21984,c.j.,I wasn’t told to say it was the flu. I was told it was the flu.
21985,c.j., I’m not getting into that! I’m not getting into who said what. We can do that  at the next of what I’m sure will be many sessions.
21986,c.j.,It’s five past noon.
21987,c.j.,Doing what?
21988,c.j., Yes.
21989,sam,Hey.
21990,toby, You see this?
21991,sam,That was nice.
21992,toby,We got good reviews on the commencement speech.
21993,sam,Yeah.
21994,toby,"From Maynard Wachtel, of all places."
21995,sam,You got a second?
21996,toby,He calls you and me the Batman and Robin of speech-writing.
21997,sam,"Well, I don’t think he does..."
21998,toby,"He doesn’t, but he should, ‘cause that’s what we are."
21999,sam,Okay.
22000,toby,We’re Batman and Robin!
22001,sam,Which one’s which?
22002,toby,"Look at me, Sam. Am I Robin?"
22003,sam,I’m not Robin.
22004,toby,"Yes, you are."
22005,sam,"Okay, well, let’s move off this."
22006,toby,"You bet, little friend."
22007,sam,"Listen, we’re really not Batman and Robin."
22008,toby,"No, we’ll keep those identities secret. I’m Bruce Wayne, and you’re my ward..."
22009,sam,Toby...
22010,toby,...Dick something.
22011,sam,Jane Gentry and Richard Will came to see me with some news. The CBO’s projection... 
22012,toby,Really?
22013,sam,Yes. Has us 200 billion lower eight years out.
22014,toby,That’s fantastic news.
22015,sam,Yes.
22016,toby,When is this real?
22017,sam,This afternoon.
22018,toby,The projections are lower?
22019,sam,Measurably lower.
22020,toby,I’m so happy I could spit. 
22021,sam,This is really the first administration in history to favor slower economic growth.
22022,toby,I favor it when it gives us a bat and ball on tax cuts.
22023,sam,Yeah.
22024,toby,"We offer ‘em a deal. We lower the bottom rate from fifteen to ten percent, but we stand  our ground on no tax cut in the top bracket, and you know why?"
22025,sam,‘Cause it turns out we might not be able to afford it.
22026,toby,Isn’t it great?
22027,sam,"Yeah, it’s Christmas in Paris, but there’s a line ATJ and the Progressive Caucus want me  to put in the draft for Chicago."
22028,toby,What?
22029,sam,"That we want to do great things, but our opponents want bigger swimming pools and faster  private jets."
22030,toby,Their private jets are too slow?
22031,sam,Toby...
22032,toby,Change the writing.
22033,sam,It’s not the writing.
22034,toby,I know.  Listen...
22035,sam,Yeah?
22036,toby,Nothing.
22037,sam,Okay.
22038,toby,Don’t worry about it.
22039,sam,So...
22040,toby,I have to go to a meeting. You should talk to somebody at ATJ or the Caucus.
22041,sam,"Okay, I’m gonna do that then."
22042,toby,Yeah.
22043,sam,Okay.
22059,bartlet,Hey.
22061,bartlet,Welcome back.
22063,bartlet,How was the flight?
22065,bartlet,"When Leo talked to you on the plane, he thought you already knew."
22067,bartlet,"And I’m saying, we still do this. We’re husband and wife and parents, and before we  launch into palace intrigue, we do, ""Welcome back. How was the flight?"""
22069,bartlet,One of the forms Zoey had to fill out for Georgetown asked for a family medical history.
22071,bartlet,Did Leo tell you the rest?
22073,bartlet,Zoey wasn’t 18 yet when she started. A parent had to sign the form.
22075,bartlet,"No, you did, Hot Pants."
22077,bartlet,It’s gonna be okay.
22079,bartlet,Look...
22081,bartlet, ‘Cause I didn’t!
22082,bartlet,I talked to Zoey this morning. She’s gonna ace her finals.
22084,bartlet,I hate Ellie’s boyfriend.
22086,bartlet,"I need you to speak to the White House Counsel, Abbey."
22088,leo,Hey.
22089,josh,The First Lady’s back?
22090,leo,Yeah.
22091,leo,I was talking to her on the phone and I mentioned Zoey’s application without realizing  the President hadn’t told her yet.
22092,josh,Why hadn’t the President told her yet?
22093,leo,What do you want from me?
22094,josh,30 million dollars.
22095,leo,No.
22096,josh,"Martin Connelly, who’s an Assistant Attorney General in the Civil Division, says they’re  out of money."
22097,leo,On the suit?
22098,josh,Yeah.
22099,leo, They’re always out of money.
22100,josh,We don’t give ‘em enough.
22101,leo,"We passed a law last summer that says they can transfer funds from Commerce, from Health  and Human Services. They can take it from Veteran’s Affairs up to what? I think 12  million dollars."
22102,josh,"Yeah, but the problem is the law says that those transfers are subject to approval by  various House committees, each of which has a chairman elected with the eight million  dollars Tobacco spent in the last election. And even if the transfers were approved,  it wouldn’t matter, ‘cause twelve million isn’t gonna get it done."
22103,leo,Neither is 30 million.
22104,josh,Then let’s give ‘em more.
22105,leo,No.
22106,josh,Why?
22107,leo,‘Cause we’re gonna lose.
22108,josh,So you give ‘em enough to win.
22109,leo,We got to liquidate the Grand Tetons.
22110,josh,They’re saying 30 million and I think it’s a steal at twice the price.
22111,leo,Staff it out to some people and report to me on it in what...?
22112,josh,"Two, three days?"
22113,leo,Good.
22114,josh,I’m going out to the airport.
22115,leo, All right... Do a job.
22116,josh, Yeah.
22117,sam,Hi.
22118,sam,"Henry, Helen. Hey, Bruce."
22119,sam,"Lewis. We just have a few minutes, right?"
22120,sam,"Well, you’ve already heard the good news. The CBO, when they project eight years out,  has the budget surplus coming in 200 billion dollars lower than we thought."
22121,sam,"Yeah, okay, there’s something wrong with all of us, but that’s for a different time.  What I wanted to mention was Jane Gentry and Richard Will say  you guys want a line in the Chicago draft."
22122,sam,"Yeah, that ""our opponents want to help the rich pay for bigger swimming pools and faster  private jets."""
22123,sam,"Well, we are hitting them hard, but I’m not gonna use the line."
22124,sam,"First of all, it’s bad writing."
22125,sam,It sounds like it was written by a high school girl.
22126,sam,There usually is when she’s in high school.
22127,sam,"It’s not the writing. Come on, Henry! ""Faster private jets and swimming pools?"""
22128,sam,And do what with them?
22129,sam,"So does ""How about 'em Cowboys?"" when you’re playing a club in Dallas, but the line  isn’t gonna change the mind of anybody who doesn’t already agree with us."
22130,sam,"I am not. I am in favor of tax cuts for those for whom it will do the most good - and  that’s a tough enough battle - and it looks like, all of a sudden, we’ve got a fair  fight. But I’m not talking about policy. I’m talking about rhetoric, and the men you  work for need to dial it down to five."
22131,sam,"Henry, last fall, every time your boss got on the stump and said, ""It’s time for the  rich to pay their fair share,"" I hid under a couch and changed my name. I left Gage  Whitney making $400,000 a year, which means I paid twenty-seven times the national  average in income tax. I paid my fair share, and the fair share of 26 other people.  And I’m happy to ‘cause that’s the only way it’s gonna work, and it’s in my best  interest that everybody be able to go to schools and drive on roads, but I don’t get  27 votes on Election Day. The fire department doesn’t come to my house 27 times  faster and the water doesn’t come out of my faucet 27 times hotter. The top one  percent of wage earners in this country pay for 22 percent of this country. Let’s  not call them names while they’re doing it, is all I’m saying."
22132,sam,No.
22133,sam,No. And I hope you’ll make it clear to your people that this has nothing to do with  diluting our position or cozying up to Republicans.
22134,sam," I know plenty of women who can write, Helen. I know women who can  blow the walls of brick buildings. This sounds like a girl."
22135,josh,Joey!
22136,josh,Joey... How you doing?
22137,josh, I’m Josh Lyman.
22138,josh,What happened to Kenny?
22139,josh, So you’re the substitute interpreter?
22140,josh,"Not exactly. Uh, Dale, I’m gonna ask you to wait over here, okay?... Uh, Joey, you’re  gonna read my lips, and if I can’t understand what you’re saying, you’ll write it down,  all right?"
22141,josh, Excuse us.
22142,josh,Dale?
22143,josh,"Pretty good-looking for an interpreter, wouldn’t you say?"
22144,josh,Dale Bracket?
22145,josh, He’s not a television detective?
22146,josh,I’m sorry?
22147,josh,You’re not getting in the car.
22148,josh,‘Cause you’re getting back on a plane in an hour and ten minutes.
22149,josh,"All right, if we sit like this, can Dale Bracket, PI, read my lips?"
22150,josh,Okay... You’re not talking to me about an agriculture poll.
22151,josh,You guessed that?
22152,josh,"Well, we are, but... that’s not important."
22153,josh,"Uh, cranberry juice and club soda...and, um, I’ll have a large glass of ice water."
22154,josh,"I told Leo McGarry that we could trust you, and Toby backed me up."
22155,josh," Eight years ago, the President was diagnosed with an illness  that was never disclosed."
22156,josh, Yes.
22193,josh,Probably in about a week.
22194,josh,"We're deciding. Probably a live interview, followed by a press conference. So we need to  know what we're talking about. Joey, we need you to put a poll in the field. You got to  come up with a model that gets us the answers we need without asking the questions we  can't ask. You gotta come up with the model by yourself, you got to break down the  results by yourself. Not even the callers can understand the questions they're asking.  And you got to do it all in 96 hours. Is what I'm describing possible?"
22195,josh,A Governor?
22196,josh,I didn't...
22197,josh,The Governor of an industrial state.
22198,josh,And you give him a degenerative illness.
22199,josh,"Joey, you understand that before this is over we're probably all going to be spending  some time in front of a grand jury."
22200,josh,You can do this?
22201,josh,That's your flight.
22202,josh,Yeah.
22203,josh, He's fine.
22204,josh,He's fine. I'll tell him you asked.
22205,josh,Yeah.
22226,c.j.,"Good evening, ma'am."
22228,c.j.,Sure.
22230,c.j.,"Well, I got pretty well bitch-slapped by the White House Counsel, ma'am, how about you?"
22232,c.j., I didn't know what he meant or why he said it.
22234,c.j.,"Babish said there's a difference between asking the President, ""Is there anything else  I *should* know,"" and, ""Is there anything else I *need* to know?"" He seemed to think  ""need to know"" implies I know something already, but I don't want it confirmed in order  to maintain... deniability."
22236,c.j.,I told him I couldn't remember which one I say.
22238,c.j.,"Abbey...  During the campaign, we were in Manhattan, Kansas, at a Sheraton,  or a Marriott, I can't remember, but we were in Manhattan, Kansas... And I came to your  suite early to tell you we'd be doing Nightline that night and we had to get to an ABC  affiliate. And I think by then the two of you were so used to people walking in and out  of your room that you didn't hear me open the door. And I was almost sure I saw you  giving the President an injection of something."
22240,c.j.,"When the President has his physical, and I do the release, I only ever ask, ""Is there  anything else I need to know?"""
22241,leo,Come on in.
22242,josh,She's in.
22243,leo,What's she going to do?
22244,josh,"""If the Governor of a major industrial state had a degenerative illness which he hadn't  disclosed during the election but which has yet to impair his job performance, would you  still support him?"""
22245,leo,Which governor?
22246,josh,Michigan.
22247,leo,Well... then we'll wait.
22248,josh,"Yeah.  Listen, about this Justice appropriation..."
22249,leo,You gonna do a report?
22250,josh,Yeah.
22251,leo,"Then, can I read the report before you ask me to green light another multi-million  dollar battle that'll have no support in Congress?"
22252,josh,"Yeah.  I just brought it up because this Assistant A.G., Martin Connelly, when  he left my office this morning he turned and said, ""They perpetrated a fraud against  the public."" And the look on his face when he said it... They want to get these people."
22253,leo,We're not big tobacco.
22254,josh,Yeah.
22255,leo,He's expecting me.
22256,josh,Okay.
22257,leo,"Good evening, Mr. President."
22258,bartlet,"Leo, how could you tell Abbey about the health form before I did?"
22259,leo,I didn't know you hadn't told her.
22260,bartlet,"My wife and I are fighting battles on several fronts at the moment, including one with  each other. Can you and I be men? Can we have a bond?"
22261,leo,We're putting a poll in the field.
22262,bartlet,How?
22263,leo,We're using a woman Josh and Toby trust named Joey Lucas.
22264,bartlet,I met Joey Lucas.
22265,leo,She's basically giving MS to the Governor of Michigan.
22266,bartlet,How's he gonna feel about that?
22267,leo,Don't worry about it.
22268,bartlet,This is a bad idea.
22269,leo,We've got to do it.
22270,bartlet,"I'm coming clean, I'm doing it voluntarily. Anyone finds out, it's going to look like  I did it because a poll told me to."
22271,leo,Then it'd be a good idea if nobody found out.
22272,bartlet, Why don't you get Sam?
22273,sam,So...
22274,toby,Yeah.
22275,sam,I think I may have offended...
22276,toby,"Oh, God."
22277,sam,Yeah.
22278,toby,Who?
22279,sam,"Well, I met with some of the staffers for Americans for Tax Justice and the Progressive  Caucus."
22280,toby,And you think you may have offended them?
22281,sam,"Yeah.  And girls, possibly."
22282,toby,Were you right?
22283,sam,"Yeah. Toby, it's class..."
22284,toby,That's all you need to tell me. I trust you.
22285,leo, Sam?
22286,sam,Yeah.
22287,leo,"Come see the President and me a minute, would you?"
22288,sam,Yeah.
22289,toby,Sam?
22290,sam,Yeah?
22291,toby,I'll be here in the office when you're done.
22292,sam,"Yeah, okay."
22293,c.j.,Hey.
22294,josh,You walking?
22295,c.j.,Yeah.
22296,josh,I met with Joey Lucas today.
22297,c.j.,I heard.
22298,josh,So now the President's got Leo worried it's going to look like we announced it because  we took a poll.  What do you think?
22299,josh,What?
22300,c.j., The President and Leo are worried about that?
22301,josh,Yeah. What?
22302,c.j.,"You guys are like Butch and Sundance peering over the edge of a cliff to the  boulder-filled rapids 300 feet below, thinking you better not jump 'cause there's  a chance you might drown. The President has this disease and has been lying about  it, and you guys are worried that the polling might make us look bad? It's the fall  that's gonna kill ya!"
22303,josh,"""Us."""
22304,c.j.,What?
22305,josh,"You said, ""It's the fall that's gonna kill you."" You meant, ""us."""
22306,josh,"Where are you going, C.J.?"
22307,c.j.,I'm going home.
22308,josh,"No, I meant..."
22309,c.j.,I know what you meant. I want to sleep for a while. I'm going home.
22310,josh,"You know, uh, Donna got hold of this fax that was sent to the press office from the  OSF at NASA."
22311,c.j.,"What, something falling out of the sky?"
22312,josh,Yeah.
22313,c.j.,We get that fax once a week.
22314,josh,"Yeah, but Donna doesn't know that. She thinks it's an emergency."
22315,c.j.,And you didn't want to tell her?
22316,josh,"No, 'cause the other way you get a day's worth of entertainment without leaving the  office. She doesn't know that these things fall out of the sky all the time... once  every ten days, as a matter of fact. Since the first year we started putting man-made  objects in space, 17,000 have come back and remarkably, not one person has been hit.   So I suppose there's an argument to be made that we're due."
22317,c.j.,"Yeah. You picked me right up there, Josh."
22318,josh,See you tomorrow!
22319,bartlet,He talked to her on the phone?
22320,leo,He talked to her at the airport.
22321,bartlet,But he called her on the phone?
22322,leo,To get her to the airport.
22323,bartlet,"Yeah, but I'm saying, did she hang up the phone, turn to her friends and say, 'You're  never gonna believe why I'm getting on a plane?'"
22324,leo,He told her she was coming out to do some polling on subsurface agriculture.
22325,bartlet,What the hell is that?
22326,leo,It's vegetables that grow underground. He told her she was coming out here to find out  if Americans were eating more beets.
22327,bartlet, Is this a joke?
22328,leo,"It was Josh, Mr. President. It was a job done well. You want to start not trusting Josh?   Let's go."
22329,bartlet,Where are we going?
22330,leo,The basement.
22331,bartlet,Why?
22332,leo,'Cause I don't like the way it looks the seven of us meeting in the middle of the night.
22333,bartlet,You like the way it looks if we're meeting in the basement?
22334,leo,Let's go.
22335,sam,These numbers are going to be meaningless.
22336,toby,Yeah.
22337,sam,The governor from an industrial state. It's posed as a hypothetical before people have any  education on...
22338,toby, Yeah.
22339,sam,"Plus there is no way to factor existing approval numbers, particularly when it comes  to matters of trust."
22340,toby, Saggitarius.
22341,toby,Are they on their way?
22342,josh,Yeah.
22343,toby,They're on their way?
22344,c.j.,Yeah.
22345,toby,"Joey, your flight was all right? "
22346,toby,Your flight was okay?
22347,sam," These numbers aren't going to mean anything, right?  With the hypothetical and the lack of context? Plus the preexisting level of trust."
22348,c.j.,Yeah.
22349,sam,I'm saying he's got numbers like Walter Cronkite.
22350,josh,Is there anything in there that we're gonna like?
22351,josh,Okay.
22352,bartlet,Good evening.
22353,josh,"Mr. President, you remember Joey Lucas?"
22354,bartlet,Yeah.
22355,josh,And her interpreter Kenny?
22356,leo,"Joey, did you make photocopies of that?"
22357,leo,Good. Let's get started.
22358,bartlet,Excuse me. How many people in this room know Kenny's last name? 
22359,leo,It's fine.
22360,bartlet,I believe this operation is no longer covert.
22361,bartlet,Josh?
22362,josh,Yeah.
22363,bartlet, Go ahead.
22364,c.j.,We just lost Florida.
22365,bartlet,They may be right.
22366,bartlet,"Joey, is there any good news in there at all?"
22367,leo,Who's in Port-au-Prince right now?
22368,leo,Which consists of...
22369,leo,And the OAS?
22370,bartlet, What happened last night?
22371,bartlet,Yeah.
22372,leo,Anybody killed?
22373,bartlet,Where is the president-elect?
22374,bartlet,Sorry?
22375,bartlet,And that's not the most troubling...
22376,leo,"Jake, what the hell do you mean you can't find..."
22377,leo,What about intelligence?
22378,bartlet,Leo.
22379,leo,Let's evacuate the non-essential personnel from the embassy.
22380,bartlet,"At the moment, there is no Dessaline government; there is no Dessaline! And I just got  done pulling nine dead bodies out of Colombia. Evacuate the non-essentials. Get some  Marines at the Embassy. And somebody brief Fitzwallace!"
22381,josh,Saggitarius.
22382,sam,"Why not a Presidential address? Ten - 15 minutes. 'I have this illness, I concealed it,  I apologize. Let me tell you about it. Let me reduce your fear.'"
22383,c.j.,It's too cold.
22384,sam,It's not too cold!
22385,c.j.,He needs to be with the First Lady.
22386,sam,In some decorative room? Sitting with his wife weakens him. Let's put him behind the  Kennedy desk. Let's put him in the East Room. Let's put him in the Briefing Room.
22387,c.j.,"Sam, he's gonna go on T.V. and say he lied, I don't want him doing it behind the Seal  of the President."
22388,sam,"You think without the Seal, people are gonna forget he's the President?"
22389,c.j.,We'll do a 30-minute live special from one of the news magazines.
22390,josh,"Live, live to tape or tape?"
22391,c.j.,"Live, I don't want a producer editing what he says."
22392,josh,What if we want to edit what he says?
22393,c.j.,That's our tough luck.
22394,josh,When?
22395,sam,How about Thursday night?
22396,c.j.,Wednesday night.
22397,sam,Why?
22398,c.j.," 'Cause Thursday night is when they pay their bills, and it's going to be  tough enough getting 30 minutes and not telling them why we're not cutting into their  bread and butter during May sweeps."
22399,sam,"Oh, who gives a damn about May sweeps?"
22400,c.j.,"They do, Sam! "
22401,toby,"All right. 30 minutes, Dateline special Wednesday night, night after tomorrow, the  President and the First Lady in the Mural Room."
22402,c.j.,And we follow that with a press conference.
22403,josh,Why?
22404,c.j.,"To control the story as long as possible. Once he gets started with Russert or Diane  or Stone Phillips or whoever the hell does this, I'm gonna need every reporter in the  Western Hemisphere in the room where I can see him."
22405,toby,We put a team of medical experts up there.
22406,c.j.,We have 48 hours to find them.
22407,sam,"Hang on. If we take him from the Mural Room to the press conference, isn't a smart  reporter going to ask, 'Mr. President, are you planning on seeking reelection?'"
22408,c.j.," A smart reporter... Sam, Ted Baxter is gonna ask, 'Mr President, are  you planning on seeking reelection?"""
22409,sam,"So, we're gonna need an answer to that too."
22410,josh,Hey.
22411,josh,Really?
22412,josh,"It's an old stereotype, Mrs. L. Did you get the extended service warranty?"
22413,josh,Women.
22414,josh,I got a message Leo wanted to see me.
22415,josh,Did you get the tow package?
22416,leo,Margaret!
22417,leo,Where's Josh?
22418,leo,"He remembers where my office is, right?"
22419,josh,"Leo, calm down. I'm right here."
22420,leo,Get out. 
22421,leo, This report is staggering.
22422,josh,I know.
22423,leo,"Justice has 31 lawyers and staff. Tobacco has 1,893 lawyers and 2,783 paralegals.  This is no typo, right?"
22424,josh,No.
22425,leo,"We spent 8.7 million on our side counsel, they spent 192. The 61.3 million they spent  on travel expenses is twice as much as we spent on our entire case."
22426,josh,Yes.
22427,leo,Who oversees the Justice department Budget?
22428,josh,"The Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, State, and the Judiciary."
22429,leo,Who's the ranking minority member?
22430,josh,Ritter.
22431,leo,Talk to him. Find out what the problem is.
22432,josh,Yeah. 
22433,leo, Josh? How's it going downstairs?
22434,josh," We'll have an answer on it by the end of the day.  It's looking like 30 minutes on Dateline and a press conference, but Leo, it's also  looking like any scenario is going to require a firm position from the President on  reelection."
22435,leo,"Well, we'll have that answer by the end of the day, too."
22436,josh,Will we?
22437,leo,Yes.
22438,josh,Leo...
22439,leo,He just had Joey's numbers in the middle of the night. Give him the day!
22440,josh,Don't you think it would help if we had a discussion among the...
22441,josh,A discussion among the rest of us...
22442,leo,Excuse me. 
22443,bartlet,What?
22444,leo,Two of Dessalines' bodyguards were shot. We think he's headed to our embassy.
22445,bartlet,How do we know?
22446,leo,Peter Bratt got a message through.
22447,bartlet,What is Peter Bratt doing down there?
22448,leo,"He went down for the inauguration, and he may well have Dessaline in the trunk of  his car."
22449,bartlet,In the trunk of his car?
22450,leo,"Yes, sir."
22451,bartlet,Did we evacuate the non-essentials?
22452,leo,"They're on their way. A C-9's waiting for them on the runway. Mr. President, if we  don't take Dessaline, he'll be convicted in a 20-minute trial, imprisoned for life,  or probably executed by the Junta."
22453,leo,"Of course we're choosing sides! There was a free election! We saw to it there was a  free election, and Dessaline won!"
22454,leo,"Mr. President, there will never be real elections in Haiti if the military thinks it  can simply kill the winner. Also I'd like to point out, sir, that we encouraged  Dessaline to run--in fact we strongly encouraged it--and now he's in the trunk of a car."
22455,bartlet,Let him in.
22456,bartlet,Let him in!
22457,toby,Do we put Hoynes up there?
22458,sam,At the press conference?
22459,toby,Do we put Hoynes up there?
22460,sam,There's never been a more important time to emphasize the Vice Presidency.
22461,c.j.,The Vice President's presence underlines the health risks to the President.
22462,sam,And it's good to underscore that the President anticipated this problem with the  selection of the Vice President.
22463,c.j.,But it'll also serve to underscore that he anticipated the problem and didn't tell  anybody about it.
22464,sam,Hoynes was one of the first people to know. If he's there it's a breathing demonstration  that he signed off on the president's health and joined the ticket.
22465,c.j.,"And he'll get bombarded with questions about what he did or didn't know, and the press  corps will impanel themselves as a grand jury."
22466,sam,"Then let them, C.J.! We did something wrong or we didn't."
22467,c.j.,"Well fantastic, Sam, I didn't realize it was that simple!"
22468,c.j.,"There's a situation developing in Port-Au-Prince, I have to get ready to brief. "
22469,toby,"Sam, can Josiah Bartlet function as President?"
22470,sam,I'm not a medical expert.
22471,toby,Right.
22472,sam,"Toby, there is a responsibility and the future and an obligation to the party, and if  he is not gonna run, then he's gotta point to Hoynes and say, 'This is our guy.'"
22473,toby,"And what if they ask Hoynes, 'In the meantime, can Bartlet function as President?'"
22474,sam,He'll say yes.
22475,toby,"What if he says, 'I'm not a medical expert'?"
22476,josh,Yes.
22477,josh,"Well don't go anywhere, cause I need you."
22478,josh,"You may be right, but Haiti's actually not what I wanted to talk to you about."
22479,josh,"Yeah, Andy. The president wants to get behind a 30 million dollar appropriations bill  the Justice Department's had in your committee for a few months now. They need the  money to continue the case."
22480,josh,Has the chairman scheduled a vote?
22481,josh,He's not gonna schedule a vote?
22482,josh,How much tobacco money has he taken?
22483,josh,Yeah.
22484,josh,Is there a nose count?
22485,josh,Along party lines?
22486,josh,They've got two Democrats?
22487,josh,Warren and Rossitter aren't even from the South.
22488,josh,This is a phenomenally important case. It's historic. It has to be won. And we're  fighting with paper clips and a slingshot.
22489,toby,Hi.
22491,toby,Have a seat.
22493,toby,"Yeah, Donna. Uh, I'm going to tell you something shocking except we don't have time  to be shocked. So I need you to just hear it and go back to work."
22495,toby,"Eight years ago, the President was diagnosed with M.S. He concealed it during the  election, but we're going public Wednesday night with a live network interview and  a press conference. This is what Josh is gonna be working on 24 hours and he's gonna  need your help and he's gonna need you to know, and so I'm telling you..."
22497,toby,"You're the first person on the assistant level to find out. Margaret doesn't know,  Bonnie and Ginger don't know. Donna, Mrs. Landingham doesn't know."
22499,toby,No. He's in remission.
22501,toby,I want to press upon you how important it is that this not be discussed beyond...
22503,c.j., I was looking for Leo.
22504,c.j.,That's usually a good sign.
22505,leo,How many are they saying?
22506,leo,Well how many are they estimating?
22507,leo,"No, we need the cavalry."
22508,leo,"We sold those to them, right?"
22509,leo,Still...
22510,leo,What do we have?
22511,leo,What happens when the first shot is fired?
22512,leo,"Nancy, if they take the embassy, how are we gonna know? Are they going to send some  kind of note?"
22513,c.j.,"The U.S.S. Enterprise as well as the amphibious carriers out of Mayport, Florida, are  being dispatched to the region and are expected to be there in 36 hours and aircraft  will be in the combat radius of 300 to 400 miles within 12 hours and you'll get more  details on that when the Pentagon briefs at three."
22514,c.j.,Katie.
22515,c.j.,State will brief later in the day. 
22516,c.j.,There is no Bazan government.
22517,c.j.,"You're not taking me there, Mark."
22518,c.j.,"It should be clear that we're talking about two separate issues: one is a democratically- elected president whose people are being denied their leader by an armed militia, the  other is the lives of the Americans in the embassy and the American marines who are  guarding them."
22519,c.j.,How about that? I'll be back in a few hours. 
22520,c.j.,Is he here?
22521,c.j.,Do I look all right?
22522,c.j.,That's what you're saying to me?
22523,c.j.,Paul.
22524,c.j.,"Bonnie, thank you. Would you step outside the door, please, and knock if anybody wants  to come in?"
22525,c.j.,Yeah.
22526,c.j.,The White House Press Corps.
22527,c.j.,I need 30 minutes night after tomorrow.
22528,c.j.,It's not Haiti.
22529,c.j.,I'm not gonna tell you.
22530,c.j.,Tell him it's your network.
22531,c.j.,"That we need 30 minutes Wednesday night. On Wednesday morning, I'll tell you why. You  pick the interviewer, they'll have 10 hours to prepare."
22532,c.j.,The President and the First Lady.
22533,c.j.,In this room.
22534,c.j.,No network logo.
22535,c.j.,"Paul, I've got to get two other networks and CNN to pick this up live; bad enough it's  gonna be your guy and not theirs, but they'll run an old Petticoat Junction before they  put your network brand on their air."
22536,c.j.,Yeah.
22537,c.j.,Yeah.
22538,c.j.,No. The water is exactly at my head.
22539,c.j.,"Paul, we'll start to leak Wednesday morning to soften up the ground a little bit.  Anything leaks before then and I'll take my business across the street."
22540,josh,...because I wasn't aware of any ties to tobacco you have.
22541,josh,Yeah.
22542,josh,Yes.
22543,josh,"Well... Uh... I'm not a litigator and I don't work at the Justice Department, and  there's a reason why both those things are true... but I wouldn't think it'd be that  hard to prove that the tobacco companies have lied since we already know they did!"
22544,josh,Are you saying that people who start smoking and get addicted to nicotine are too  stupid to live?
22545,josh,"Too stupid to be... Every day, the Justice Department uncovers evidence that cigarette  companies knew far better than the rest of us, that smoking causes death and disease.  To say nothing of the CEOs being the last seven people on earth to discover that  nicotine was addictive."
22546,josh,"It's almost three o'clock. By seven, 3000 new people will have taken up smoking; 2800  of them will be under 18. "
22547,sam,"Good afternoon, Mrs. Bartlet."
22549,sam,I think.... I know we used it to plan some of the Millenium things.
22551,sam,"I don't know, ma'am; I could check it out."
22553,sam,Yeah. 
22554,sam,"What we're talking about is 30 minutes with an interviewer. The questions will be  entirely about the medical history, there'll be no questions about the law."
22556,sam,"She will Wednesday morning, when she tells them what it's about."
22558,sam,"'Cause if they don't, they'll lose the story."
22560,sam,"So I'd like to go through the story, get a sense of what you're going to say, run it  by Oliver Babish and spend the next couple of days going over it with you."
22562,sam,Yeah.
22564,sam,Ma'am.
22566,sam,In laymen's terms?
22568,sam,And those symptoms subsided.
22570,sam,And two years later?
22572,sam,Mrs. Bartlet...
22574,sam,"Yes, ma'am. The language you use..."
22576,sam,I'm sorry?
22578,sam,Yes. The language you use...
22580,leo,Thank you.
22581,bartlet,What happened?
22582,leo,We shot three Haitian soldiers on the runway.
22583,bartlet,They boarded the plane?
22584,leo,Ground traffic control stopped the plane. 
22585,leo,"When the soldiers boarded, they were told they'd illegally boarded a U.S. Air Force C9.  They were told to drop their weapons; they were told again. Two staff sergeants in  the bulkhead had a clear shot and took 'em. They dumped the bodies on the tarmac and  made an emergency takeoff."
22586,bartlet,Leo...
22587,leo,Sir...
22588,bartlet,That wasn't supposed to happen!
22589,leo,"Look, if..."
22590,bartlet,I evacuated the non-essentials specifically so that wouldn't happen!
22591,leo,And we came two minutes...
22592,bartlet,I gave the order six hours ago!
22593,leo,They had to...
22594,bartlet, Six hours ago I gave the order! What the hell were they still doing  on the runway?!
22595,leo,"They had to be collected, sir, they weren't all in one place."
22596,bartlet,We shot three men...
22597,leo,That's what you do!
22598,bartlet,We what?
22599,leo,A foreign hostile puts his foot on an American military plane- that's an attack!  And rules of engagement give us every right to repel.
22600,bartlet,And I'm sure these guys had their handbooks with them!
22601,leo,These guys were there to keep the plane on the ground.
22602,bartlet,The plane is up in the air?
22603,leo,"Yes, sir."
22604,bartlet,What's happening on the ground?
22605,leo,We're communicating through diplomatic back channels. 
22606,bartlet,Who are we using?
22607,leo,"The Canadian Ambassador, Dominican intelligence."
22608,bartlet,And what does Bazan want?
22609,leo,Dessaline.
22610,bartlet,On what charge?
22611,leo,"That, as Treasury Minister, he embezzled 18 million dollars earmarked for humanitarian aid."
22612,bartlet,I'm sold.
22613,leo,"Margaret, get me the Secretary of State."
22614,bartlet,"You're right, you know, I should be bringing them in on reelection. I should be talking  to them."
22615,leo,Yeah.
22616,bartlet,I don't want to make the same mistakes over again.
22617,leo,"Yeah, not when there are so many new mistakes we can make."
22618,bartlet,Yeah. Let's start tonight. Around nine o'clock we'll meet in the residence.
22619,leo," Scott! I'm with the President, we're going to need to invoke 1070 at OAS."
22620,bartlet,Bob Cratchit.
22621,bartlet,Never... You bought a new car?
22622,bartlet,And you paid sticker price.
22623,bartlet,"You need to look at the next page - subsection B, paragraph four, Mamie Yokum."
22624,bartlet,Secret Service'd have you down like a calf at a rodeo.
22625,bartlet," ""The definition of 'gift' excludes opportunities and benefits including favorable  rates and commercial discounts available to the public at large."""
22626,bartlet,And?
22627,bartlet, Is the reason you didn't tell me you were getting a new car... you...?  Did you think I was gonna think it was an extravagance?
22628,bartlet,"You don't think I think you should have a new car?  Delores, have you ever had  a new car?"
22629,bartlet,How about you let me find out what you were supposed to pay and write you a check for  the difference?
22630,bartlet, Is it a nice one?
22631,bartlet,Smell?
22632,bartlet,It's the smell of freedom... and the chemicals they treat the dashboard with.
22633,bartlet,When are you picking it up?
22634,bartlet,"Do me a favor, would you? Come back here after you pick it up. I'd like to talk to you  about something."
22635,bartlet,And put the car in the driveway. I'd like to kick the tires.
22636,bartlet," It's an expression, Fannie Mae! Go get your car!"
22639,sam," Yes, ma'am."
22642,sam, What a dumb major you had.
22644,sam,No.
22646,sam,Sure.
22671,josh, I didn't even see you there.
22673,josh,"I've been with...  ...you know, tobacco."
22675,josh,Yeah.
22677,josh," I'll... tell you what that is. That's the Blue Ribbon  Commission on Reform. Let me tell you, I'm gonna be collecting benefits or, you know,  not by the time we get this Blue Ribbon thing up."
22679,josh,Yeah?
22681,josh,"Donna, what?"
22683,josh, Are you all right?
22685,josh,C.J. putting the lid on?
22688,c.j.,"The OAS has agreed to meet in an emergency session tomorrow morning, but we're still  waiting for confirmation."
22689,c.j.,"Yes, but first we're gonna say it to them."
22690,c.j.,"Sorry, Mark. We've run out of time, but we'll pick it up with our lightning round  tomorrow. I'm calling a full lid. Any developments throughout the night and you'll  be paged. Thank you for your patience, everybody."
22691,c.j., Thanks.
22692,toby,"Leo. This is insane, plain and simple."
22693,leo,"What's insane? Oh, never mind. What isn't?"
22694,toby,You don't think it's crazy?
22695,leo,I don't even know what we're talking about.
22696,toby,We're firming up strategy on what will define the future of this presidency and we don't  know if this President is interested in the future. We have to have a discussion and we  have to have it tonight.
22697,leo,We're having a discussion.
22698,toby,When?
22699,leo,Tonight.
22700,toby,Okay then.
22701,josh,Good evening.
22702,leo,"Good evening, Josh."
22703,josh,"Leo, would you excuse us for a second? Toby, can I talk to you outside?"
22704,josh,You told Donna.
22705,toby,Yeah.
22706,josh,Why didn't you let me?
22707,toby,You hadn't yet.
22708,josh, How'd she take it?
22709,toby,"If everybody out there takes it the way she did, we may be okay. If a few more people  in here took it the way she did, that'd be all right, too."
22710,josh, Was that for me?
22711,toby,That was for me.
22712,leo,Tobacco.
22713,josh,"Kalmbach's not gonna let it come to a vote in the subcommittee, which at the moment  is fine, 'cause if he did, it'd be 8-7 against."
22714,leo,Party lines?
22715,josh, No... We have Stacy and Miner but Warren and Rossitter are voting  against. They have ideological problems with the case... What do you wanna do now?
22716,leo,Stick some dynamite up Warren and Rossitter's ass.
22717,josh,"Yeah, the problem is, Rossitter sits on the Judiciary Committee and I don't know how  many enemies on Judiciary we wanna make right now."
22718,leo," Both of you listen. We're not gonna stop, soften, detour, postpone, circumvent,  obfuscate, or trade a single one of our goals to allow for whatever extracurricular  nonsense is coming our way in the next few days, weeks, and months."
22719,toby, When did we decide this?
22720,leo, You got a recommendation for me?
22721,c.j.,30 minutes Wednesday night. Live.
22722,leo,Live to tape?
22723,c.j.,Live.
22724,josh,The Mural Room?
22725,c.j.,"Yeah. They pick the interviewer, it's carried on all the networks and CNN. I give it to  them ten hours before."
22726,toby,And that's followed by a press conference.
22727,c.j.,"There isn't another step we can take until we know what the President's intentions are.  We need a discussion, and I hate to sound shrill, but it can't wait another night."
22728,toby,We're having a discussion.
22729,c.j.,When?
22730,josh,Tonight.
22731,c.j.,Really?
22732,leo,Yeah.
22733,c.j.,That's great.
22734,sam,Good evening.
22735,leo,"Sam, what do you know?"
22736,sam,I know that fluid accumulating in the semicircular canals of the vestibulo-cochlear  nerve is usually what'll account for dizziness.
22737,sam,"Leo, I want to state right here, right now, in terms so plain and clear as to command  their assent..."
22738,leo, We're having a meeting tonight.
22739,sam,The whole country's gonna assume he's not running when he announces the thing.
22740,leo, We're having a meeting.
22741,sam,The press is gonna assume...
22742,leo, We're having a meeting!
22743,sam,Really?
22744,leo,Yeah.
22745,sam,That's great.
22746,leo,Yeah.
22747,leo," Why doesn't everybody grab something to eat, be back at 9:00, and  you'll get called to come over to the residence."
22748,leo,"Josh, walk out with me."
22749,leo,I mean it - set one off under these guys.
22750,josh,How about I have C.J. make a statement at her briefing?
22751,leo, A strong statement.
22752,josh,"""The President calls on Congress to fund the Justice Department's tobacco lawsuit at the  levels necessary to continue this litigation."""
22753,leo,"""The American people deserve their day in court."""
22754,josh," ""And this Administration won't sit on the bench while well-fed members of  the Appropriations Committee choke off funding for a lawsuit aimed at the perpetrators of  hundreds of thousands of negligent homicides while filling their campaign war chests."""
22755,leo,Light 'em up!
22756,leo,Charlie?
22757,leo,What happened?
22758,leo,"Charlie, is she all right?"
22759,leo, Is he alone?
22760,leo,Yes.
22761,leo,Yeah.
22762,leo,Yeah.
22763,leo, You think you're the first one to say it?
22764,leo,"You are, at minimum, the 35th in the last two hours."
22765,leo,"Harry, Bill, there's going to be a press conference tonight. I'd watch."
22766,toby,"He'll sit here, with the First Lady on his right."
22767,toby,"The fireplace is too much. He'll sit here, which means they're gonna have to light the  room from the outside the window. Do they know that?"
22768,toby,The last time they didn't know. The President taped an Easter message that looked like  it was lit by Ed Wood!
22769,sam,Toby.
22770,toby,"A pitcher of water, but keep it off-screen."
22771,sam,Do they know?
22772,toby,"They gotta light from outside the window, if they don't light from outside the window..."
22773,sam,"I don't care. Look, Toby, has anyone considered whether or not he's up for this?"
22774,toby,Up for this?
22775,sam,"I mean, some stuff has happened since..."
22776,toby,"C.J. gave it to the network. We're pretty much locked in, so..."
22777,sam,When are we prepping with him?
22778,toby,After the service.
22779,sam,There's gonna be time?
22780,toby,We'll have the afternoon.
22781,sam,I think we should consider taking...
22782,toby," There aren't any options left. We're going on T.V., at eight."
22783,toby,Yeah.
22784,toby,"No, I took him off."
22785,toby,Why?
22786,toby, We've got her funeral today. We've got these...
22787,toby," Yeah, all right."
22788,c.j.,Carol.
22789,c.j.," AP, Reuters, Agence France, something about seating on  Air Force One..."
22790,c.j., Seating arrangements on Air Force One.
22791,c.j.,"Listen, I was thinking since it's probably going to be a light day, I'd maybe blow off  work, go shopping or something. What do you need?"
22792,josh,Can I give you a quick brief?
22793,c.j.,Sure.
22794,josh,The Justice Department's run out of money in their suit against the tobacco companies. 
22795,c.j.,The Justice Department's overmatched.
22796,josh,"Yeah, by hundreds of millions of dollars. They're asking for $30 million and we think  they should have it."
22797,c.j.,Who disagrees with us?
22798,josh,"Eight of the fifteen members of the subcommittee that controls the budgets for Justice  and Commerce, including Kalmbach, who has significant ties to tobacco, and Warren and  Rossitter, who do not."
22799,c.j.,We lost two Democrats?
22800,josh,They have ideological objections.
22801,c.j.,"Yeah, it's just not a good time to be losing Democrats."
22802,josh,You haven't been in my office this morning.
22803,c.j.,We'll get them back.
22804,josh,"Anyway, uh, Leo felt pretty strongly that we should light a fire under it, so I wrote  up a pretty strongly worded release."
22805,c.j., This is like the fire  we used to throw in the early primaries.
22806,josh, Let Bartlet be Bartlet.
22807,c.j.,You got to put it away for a while.
22808,josh,You think?
22809,c.j.,"I'm going in there now to tell them a landing ship helicopter assault team is steaming  off Port-au-Prince and after that I'm bringing in AP, Reuters, and Agence France.  Nobody's gonna write about an Appropriations Bill. Haiti's gonna get bumped to the  Lifestyle section."
22810,josh,"Yeah, I suppose. "
22811,josh,Listen... Have you seen him today?
22812,c.j., No. Have you?
22813,josh,No.
22814,c.j.,"All right. Listen, I've gotta..."
22815,josh,Yeah. Thanks.
22816,sam,Yeah.
22817,sam, Okay.
22818,sam, Thanks.
22819,sam,"When I say 'okay,' that's it. Close your notebooks. We don't talk like that here.  I don't give a damn whose nephew you are. Tommy, President Bartlet's not a candidate.  He's the President."
22820,leo,What are the conditions inside the embassy?
22821,leo,Any injuries?
22822,leo,The Red Cross can help us out there?
22823,leo,What's outside?
22824,leo,Which are trained at?
22825,bartlet,Why?
22826,leo,So if we invade...?
22827,bartlet,Okay. Send Fitzwallace down. Anything else?
22828,bartlet,They've been in there 48 hours.
22829,bartlet,The guy's been President of his country for two days. He's spent them both at gunpoint.
22830,bartlet,What do you know about this storm?
22831,bartlet,It's moving from Florida to South Carolina.
22832,bartlet,It's a tropical storm.
22833,bartlet,"No, I mean it's been designated a tropical storm. That means it has a surface wind  speed of something."
22834,bartlet,Isn't it strange to have a tropical storm in May?
22835,bartlet,I'm pretty sure there's a season and this isn't it.
22836,bartlet,I mean it's not a big deal. It's just that I'm pretty sure it's strange.
22837,bartlet,You ever been to National Cathedral?
22838,bartlet,You know you could lay the Washington Monument down on its side in that church?
22839,bartlet,We should try it.
22840,bartlet, I need pallbearers.
22841,c.j.,Also in the combat radius will be six J-Socs out of McDill and a Battalion Landing Team.  They'll cover that at the Pentagon briefing.
22842,c.j.,Yes.
22843,c.j.,"Of course it doesn't, but it should underline the consequences for Bazan should he  decide to enter our embassy and/or arrest the democratically elected President of  Haiti. That's all I have for now. Thank you."
22844,c.j.,Yeah.
22845,sam,We've got a problem.
22846,c.j., That's pretty hard to believe.
22847,sam,We can't have the press conference in the East Room.
22848,c.j.,What are you talking about?
22849,sam,I just got off the phone with Brian Coburn and we can't have it in the East Room.
22850,c.j., Why not?
22851,sam,They've been pulling the wiring and they found asbestos and they have to seal it off.
22852,c.j., There's been asbestos in the East Room  this whole time?
22853,sam,Yeah. So I'm gonna make a list...
22854,c.j., Put together - okay - put together a list of alternatives.
22855,sam,Yeah.
22856,c.j., Come on in...
22857,c.j., Get inside.
22858,c.j.,"This isn't about seating arrangements. Notebooks, no tape recorders. This story's  embargoed for an hour, and you'll identify me as a senior White House official."
22859,leo,Are we talking about the opening bell?
22860,leo,I'm sorry?
22861,leo,C.J.'s doing it right now.
22862,bartlet,Excuse me. Keep going.
22863,leo,In what sectors?
22864,bartlet,Charlie.
22865,bartlet,Do you have any idea why the door to the portico keeps swinging open? It's a little  annoying.
22866,bartlet, But the door opens out.
22867,bartlet, No kidding!
22868,leo,What about Europe and Japan?
22869,bartlet,Charlie says there's a wind tunnel created by something. They're fixing the latch.
22870,bartlet,Yeah?
22871,leo, Is the motorcade ready?
22872,bartlet,"Okay. Well, we've got to go. I don't know what to say. Leo's pretty rich. Maybe he can  buy some tech stocks and jack up the price."
22873,leo," Keep me posted on the bellwethers, okay?"
22874,leo, Is the First Lady meeting us in the car?
22875,bartlet,What did she say?
22876,leo,She said the First Lady's meeting us in the car.
22878,bartlet,The driver?
22881,bartlet, Yeah.
22883,bartlet,The world'll rest easier. 
22884,bartlet,We're here. 
22885,leo, It was a beautiful service I thought. 
22886,bartlet,Yeah.
22887,leo," She was a real dame, old  friend. A real broad."
22888,bartlet, Yeah.
22889,leo," We've gotta go back to the office now, sir."
22890,bartlet, Yeah.
22891,leo, We've got some decisions to make now.
22892,bartlet,"Leo, would you do me a favor?"
22893,leo,Yeah?
22894,bartlet, Would you ask the agents to seal the cathedral for a minute?
22895,leo,Yeah.
22896,bartlet," You're a son of a bitch, you know that? "
22897,bartlet,"She bought her first new car and you hit her with a drunk driver. What, was that  supposed to be funny? ""You can't conceive, nor can I, the appalling strangeness of the  mercy of God,"" says Graham Greene. I don't know who's ass he was kissing there 'cause  I think you're just vindictive. What was Josh Lyman? A warning shot? That was my son.  What did I ever do to yours but praise his glory and praise his name? There's a  tropical storm that's gaining speed and power. They say we haven't had a storm this  bad since you took out that tender ship of mine in the north Atlantic last year...  68 crew. You know what a tender ship does? Fixes the other ships. Doesn't even carry  guns. Just goes around, fixes the other ships and delivers that mail. That's all it  can do.   I've committed many sins. Have I displeased you, you feckless thug? 3.8 million new  jobs, that wasn't good? Bailed out Mexico, increased foreign trade, 30 million new  acres of land for conservation, put Mendoza on the bench, we're not fighting a war,  I've raised three children..."
22898,bartlet, That's not enough to buy me out of the doghouse? Haec credam a deo pio?  A deo iusto? A deo scito? 
22899,bartlet,Cruciatus in crucem! Tuus in terra servus nuntius fui officium perfeci.  Eas in crucem!
22900,bartlet, You get Hoynes!
22901,c.j.,We'll call them Answer A and Answer B.
22902,josh,Yeah.
22903,c.j.,Mr. President does this mean you won't be seeking a second term? Answer A is 'You bet.  I will absolutely be seeking a second term. I'm looking forward to the campaign. There is  great work that is yet to be done.'
22904,josh,Yes.
22905,c.j.,Answer B...
22906,josh,'Are you out of your mind? I can't possibly win re-election. I lied about a degenerative  illness. I'm the target of a Grand Jury investigation and Congress is about to take me  out to lunch. I'd sooner have my family take their clothes off and dance the Tarantella  on the Truman Balcony than go through a campaign with this around my neck.'
22907,josh,You think that's too on the nose?
22908,c.j.,I do.
22909,sam, I want to bring it up again.
22910,c.j.,Why?
22911,sam, 'Cause I got shouted down the first three times and I work here just like you do.  Can I help you?
22912,c.j.,Sorry.
22913,sam, I think we have to explore ways of calling this off.
22914,toby,Sam...
22915,sam,I think it might be a mistake to send him on at a moment when we're trying to  demonstrate...
22916,toby,Listen...
22917,sam," We don't know what the hell they're talking about in there, Toby. We don't  know whether he's running or not! I think we have to..."
22918,toby,"There are no ways. The story's leaked. It's out there. We're doing this. Don't worry,  it's going to be fine. "
22919,toby, They're lighting him from outside the window.
22920,toby, I have a meeting with Greg Summerhays for reasons past understanding.
22921,toby,Hello.
22922,toby,"Good Morning, Greg."
22923,toby,Thank you.
22924,toby,Yeah.
22925,toby,You want to buy Atlantic Intermediate.
22926,toby,"Greg, there's a reason the FCC..."
22927,toby, Why are you here?
22928,toby,Okay. Thanks for coming in. Excuse me.
22930,josh,"Yeah. Yeah, it was."
22932,josh,Yeah.
22935,josh, This is how it works today.
22937,toby, Don't anybody talk to me right now.
22938,toby,"Josh, Greg Summerhays was here to offer me a job.  Leo got me a damned lifeboat!"
22939,toby, I'm gonna rip his arms off...
22940,josh, Toby...
22941,toby,...and beat him with his own...
22942,josh, That was Leo. He wants us over there. It's answer B.
22943,bartlet,Yeah.
22944,leo,"I'm gonna get C.J., you two do a last minute review."
22945,bartlet,I'm fine.
22946,leo,I'm gonna get C.J.
22947,bartlet,Yeah.
22948,leo, Sit here. Close your eyes a few minutes. Charlie will get you when  we're ready.
22949,bartlet,Yeah.
22950,leo,Toby...
22951,toby,Yeah.
22952,leo,Where's C.J.?
22953,toby,She ran back to her office. 
22954,toby,They're gonna run this clip forever.
22955,leo,"No, we're about to give them clips to beat it."
22956,toby,"Leo, you got me a lifeboat?"
22957,leo,Greg Summerhays.
22958,toby,Yeah.
22959,leo,"Yeah, I got you a lifeboat."
22960,toby,Did you imagine there are any circumstances under which I would use it?
22961,leo,No.
22962,toby,Then why?
22963,leo,To show him that.
22964,leo,C.J.'s in her office?
22965,toby,"You think he's gonna change his mind, don't you? "
22966,leo,Hmm?
22967,toby,You think he's gonna run?
22968,leo,C.J.'s in her office?
22969,toby,Yeah.
22970,bartlet,Yeah!
22971,bartlet,Yeah.
22973,bartlet,How are you?
22975,bartlet,That was the easy part.
22977,bartlet, Talk about the weather.
22979,bartlet,"And there's a tropical storm seizing, right?"
22981,bartlet,"Okay, and how many times say, in the last hundred years, has a tropical storm come off  the Atlantic seaboard to Washington in the middle of May?"
22983,bartlet,At all?
22985,c.j.,"Excuse me, sir."
22986,bartlet,"Yeah. Thanks, Donna."
22988,bartlet,"According to the NOAA, the storm is a non-recurring phenomenon, which is science's term  for 'we don't know what in the world is going on, but we're stocking up on canned goods.'"
22989,c.j.,I just wanted to review a few things.
22990,bartlet,Is this stuff you don't think I'd remember from an hour ago?
22991,c.j.,"You'll want to take the first question from Lawrence Altman, the Times' Chief Medical  Correspondent."
22992,bartlet,Why?
22993,c.j.,"Because if you call on anyone else, the first question will be about reelection. Call  on Altman, it will be a medical question, and it'll have two or three follow-ups.  It'll allow you to feel comfortable a little before you start with the political mess."
22994,bartlet,Okay.
22995,c.j.,"Altman will be in the front row, first seat on your right."
22996,bartlet,Okay. 
22997,c.j.,Mr. President?
22998,bartlet,Yeah?
22999,c.j.,Where's Altman going to be?
23000,c.j.,"Mr. President, I'm going there right now. This is the last time I'm going to see you  before you step up... please, where's...?"
23001,bartlet,"Front row, first seat on the right."
23002,c.j.,Whose right?
23003,bartlet,My right.
23004,c.j.,"Thank you, sir. "
23005,bartlet,Ah... Damn it! Mrs. Landingham!
23006,bartlet, The door keeps blowing open.
23007,bartlet,I was...
23008,bartlet,"It's not that I don't know how to use it, it's just that I haven't learned yet. "
23009,bartlet,"I have M.S., and I didn't tell anybody."
23010,bartlet,You're gonna make jokes?
23011,bartlet, The party's not going to want me to run.
23012,bartlet,"I've got a secret for you, Mrs. Landingham. I've never been the most popular guy in the  Democratic Party."
23013,bartlet,Give me numbers.
23014,bartlet,How about a child born this minute has a one in five chance of being born into poverty?
23015,bartlet,44 million.
23016,bartlet,Homicide.
23017,bartlet,Three million.
23018,bartlet,Five million.
23019,bartlet,That's 13 million American children.
23020,bartlet,"Three and a half million kids go to schools that are literally falling apart. We need  127 billion in school construction, and we need it today!"
23021,bartlet,Yes.
23022,c.j.,And he'll be speaking to that just as soon as he gets here.
23023,c.j.,"Uh, Frank, then Leslie."
23024,c.j.,"Tomorrow morning, the President will direct the Attorney General appoint a Special  Prosecutor, yes."
23025,c.j.,I can't see. Joan!
23026,c.j.,"A list of three prosecutors is given to a three-judge panel. The prosecutors, as well  as the judges, were all appointed by Republican presidents. "
23027,c.j.,"Please, I can only answer 14 or 15 questions at once. Hal!"
23028,c.j.,"I can't comment on a witness list that doesn't exist, but I imagine subpoenas will be  issued to most Senior White House Staff including myself."
23029,c.j.,"Again, I can't comment on what kind of hearings Congress has in mind. I'm sure there'll  be one but you'd have to talk to Congress."
23030,c.j.,"Okay, here now, the President of the United States. "
23031,c.j., Front row on your right.
23032,bartlet,"Yes, Sandy."
23033,bartlet,"I'm sorry, Sandy, there was a bit of noise there, could you repeat the question?"
23034,leo,Watch this...
23036,toby,We created no jobs.
23038,toby,"If you work for an economist, he'll tell you, government doesn't create  jobs; business creates jobs."
23040,toby,And your point is?
23042,toby,Right now we're losing jobs.
23044,toby,You don't talk about economic accomplishemnts in a lousy economy.
23046,toby,"You want people saying, ""Hey, thanks for the nine million jobs. I've got  three of them, and I can't make the house payments""?"
23048,toby,Fridays don't count.
23050,toby,No one watches the Friday evening news. No one reads the Saturday  papers. No Presidential events on Fridays.
23052,toby,Nothing on Fridays.
23054,toby,This is how we get past crisis of the hour: seize the agenda again.
23056,toby,You need to learn this.
23058,toby,"We've barely had message since the campaign, let alone since Zoey. This  is your life for the next three months."
23060,toby,I'll drop you in Dupont Circle.
23062,toby,You think we should be touting economic accomplishment.
23064,toby,"Politics isn't about past performance-- it's ""what have you done for me  lately, and where's my years supply of turtle wax."""
23066,toby,It's someone looking for one of your 9 million new jobs.
23092,josh,I'm not reading it. There's some new stuff since the early edition.
23094,josh,"It's a puff piece, so I'll return the reporter's call, which I won't."
23096,josh,It's an embarassment. You should be stealing everyone's copies before  they can read it.
23098,josh,I'm serious. Save one for my mom.
23100,josh,"Look, don't... no gifts, no parties--just another day, okay?"
23102,josh,"Yeah, with... thing."
23104,josh,Thanks.
23106,josh,Speaker's trying to roll us again on stimulus. This story about me  sending a congressman a dead fish wrapped in newspaper--the Post get  this from you?
23108,josh,Coffee and a...
23110,josh,"Why, was there something in the... paper?"
23111,josh,"Yeah, I was the one who played sitar and made procedural changes."
23112,josh,I got a meeting.
23113,josh,"Okay, I don't think veins wield gavels, but..."
23114,josh,What about HHS appropriations?
23115,josh,Why don't you get that from Legislative Affairs?
23116,josh,"If the First Lady's got some last-minute budget request, run it through  the process."
23117,josh,"'Cause our budget's locked, and she's a sensitive topic around here.  Or... not around here, as the case may be."
23118,josh,Nothing's nothing.
23119,josh,Don't. Come on.
23120,josh,"I didn't even talk to them, if that's what..."
23121,c.j.,Hats off to the Jewish-Connecticut Corleone.
23122,toby,I'm still trying to make the cover of Jane's Defense Weekly.
23123,josh,"Hey, that fish story..."
23124,leo,"Hey, let's talk about the DNC poll. We got the first half-sample.  President's job approval down to 49%. Abbey's 11 points higher."
23125,toby,Personal approval's completely seperated from job performance.
23126,josh,"But ""strong leader"" is down, ""handling of economy"", way down."
23127,leo,"People don't feel safe with what's going on in the world, don't feel  economically secure. The Republicans are pounding us every day and  people don't think the President's leading."
23128,toby,"They love him at a barbecue, not so much with the nuclear launch codes."
23129,josh,We're not the ones who voted down the stimulus package.
23130,leo,"Our job's to get that message out, and we're going to do this like in  the campaigns. Toby's working up a new message calendar. When the  President signs off, we treat it like it's chiseled stone. No more  lurching from issue to issue. No more governors' brother-in-laws' bar  mitzvahs driving the schedule-- just a positive message, oppurtunity  and security, one day at a time."
23132,leo,What?
23133,toby,217 military promotions that were supposed to pass the Senate last night.
23134,c.j.,What about them?
23135,toby,A senator put them on anonymous hold.
23136,leo,A hold on military promotions?
23137,josh,It's Chris Carrick.
23138,leo,Why would a conservative Democrat block military promotions?
23139,josh,He threatened it last week when he stiffed us on stimulus package--it's  Carrick.
23140,c.j.,So much for opportunity and security.
23141,toby,A fight in our own party over the military.
23142,josh,It's not going to be a fight. I got this one.
23143,leo,"No, I'll handle it. Thanks, everybody."
23144,josh,I can handle Carrick.
23145,leo,It's not a thing. It's just you're a little hot after last week. I want  to be sure...
23146,josh,This is what I do. You got time to wrangle a senator on the Hill?
23147,leo,"Okay, thanks."
23148,leo,"Hey, I got a message from Legislative Affairs. HHS Appropriations--for  some reason they're reopening the bill."
23149,josh,HHS Appropriations?
23150,leo,You know about this?
23151,josh,"No. No, I don't."
23152,leo,I'll call them--it's probably nothing.
23153,josh,"Yeah, it's probably nothing."
23154,josh,"Donna, I need Amy."
23156,josh,Just... I-I need Amy.
23157,leo,"Morning, Mr. President."
23158,bartlet,"What's the problem with the Belgian elections, Leo?"
23159,leo,Is this the start of a riddle?
23160,bartlet,The intelligence briefing. The anti-immigrationist are gaining in the  north--doesn't say why or how.
23161,leo,You want more on the Flemish Bloc.
23162,bartlet,I want a CIA briefer her in person every morning. Why'd I get this on  paper.
23163,bartlet,That was Abbey's rule.
23164,bartlet,What's next?
23165,bartlet,Yeah.
23166,leo,We can't let this sit over the weekend. It's been months since we had a  clear message coming out of this building.
23167,bartlet,Months since we reduced a $2 trillion government to poll-test bromides.  You think James Madison ran his presidency off a message calendar?
23168,leo,"Probably, yes."
23169,bartlet,"""Life"" on Modays, ""liberty"" on Wednesdays, ""shaking off the tyrannical  monarch"" on alternate Thursdays."
23170,leo,Toby needs your okay this morning. One more thing--HHS Appropriations.  Remember our violence prevention initiatives?
23171,bartlet,"Republicans gutted it, 'cause ""domestic violence isn't a public health  issue,"" as if spousal abuse were part of the Atkins diet."
23172,leo,The Republicans just reopened the bill and added back every penny.
23173,bartlet,Just like that.
23174,leo,We'll get you more on the Flemish thing.
23175,josh,Five minutes with Amy?
23177,josh,I'm impressed. You read block-letter headlines.
23178,josh,"I used to work in the Senate, I do the Presidents Senate politics--I got  some sway down  there is all."
23179,josh,He tried to bottle up the fisheries bill. It wasn't... Is this an  inquisition?
23180,josh,I thought you were gonna gather up those profiles. Lord Bullingdon's  having a field day over here. 
23181,josh,We had a rule today--no gifts.
23183,josh,"How's that work, exactly?"
23185,josh,"Just don't tell anyone, okay? I don't want one of those sad-sack parties  in the Indian Treaty Room where some guy from the OMB drones on about  how I saved the aquatic weed subsidy."
23187,josh,Tell her to make time. I'm going to the Hill.
23189,josh,"You don't get to know everything, okay? This isn't an all-access pass.  You're not backstage at a Stones concert."
23190,josh,No.
23191,josh,I want him sorting mail.
23192,toby,When consumer confidnce drops seven points instead of two...
23193,c.j.,It's not the economy. That's not why our poll numbers down.
23194,c.j.,"Yeah, you can stop giving me his messages."
23195,toby,Who's Ben?
23196,c.j.,A guy I lived with for six months.
23197,toby,I didn't know you lived with a guy named Ben.
23198,c.j.,There's a lot you don't know about me.
23199,toby,Like what?
23200,c.j.,"Well, that's about it, really."
23201,toby,You don't want his calls?
23202,c.j.,"Well, if I take his call, of course it would be great to hear his  voice--he has this low, husky radio voice-- and we'd be swapping  memories and old jokes and pet names and then it's the frisky little  e-mails and pretty soon it's, you know, the weekend in Little Washington  and the late-night phone calls and that's when we begin to get on each  others nerves, 'cause we get on each others nerves. He has this thing  where he twirls his hair and... Anyway, the bloom's off the rose and I  don't call as much and it's the guilt and cherchez la femme and why- didn't-it-work-out-the-first-time and it's ten years til we talk again."
23203,toby,That was like a bad romantic comedy in fifteen seconds.
23204,c.j.,Straight to video.
23205,leo,What are you getting from the gaggle?
23206,c.j.,Latest drop in consumer confidence.
23208,toby,Why is the President dragging his feet on naming a new Chariman of the  Joint Chiefs?
23209,c.j.,The President's making his decision. Admiral Fitzwallace is still on the  job--one Chariman at a time.
23210,leo,What else?
23212,c.j.,Scrubbed two paragraphs?
23214,c.j.,What midlevel lacky tampers with an independant report?
23215,leo,You're looking at him.
23216,c.j.,I didn't mean to... Are we defending coal?
23218,c.j.,We have to do a total mea culpa. Make it a one-day story.
23219,leo,"We're not ""culpa-ing"" anything. ""The report will reflect administration  views."""
23220,c.j.,That's not going to fly if they have the original draft. There's a  threshold...
23221,leo,"""The report will reflect administration views."" That's the line. What  else? "
23222,leo,Great. Thanks.
23224,toby,I'm worried about anything that takes us off our new message.
23226,toby,Right.
23229,toby,The President signed off.
23231,toby,You're gonna have a big role in this.
23233,toby,"I need you to sit down with the Labor Secretary, the Commerce Secretary,  the Vice President, walk them through their assigned economic speeches,  then..."
23235,toby,"We've been over this. If the President's stumping for the new stimulus  package on Tuesday, you look at the calendar, then the Labor Secretary  also talks..."
23237,toby,You're right--Cabinet flunkies have job responsibilites.
23239,toby,I'm not interested in his input.
23241,toby,You want me in the meeting with you?
23243,toby,"Give him his assignment. I don't care if he likes it. You work for the  President, so does he."
23244,josh,I get it: Idaho. That's funny.
23245,josh,"No, but he'll want to see me."
23246,josh,You can't block military promotions. We went over this last week. We  can't have an intraparty fight over this when the Republicans are  thrashing us on security.
23247,josh,"These are career officers who have risked their lifes in the Gulf, in  Africa."
23248,josh,What promises are those?
23249,josh,The MB-827?
23250,josh,Senator?
23251,josh,One problem with the MB-827 launcher.
23252,josh,It doesn't work. It's a missile defense system that can't hit missiles.  It's a $270 million slingshot the Pentagon doesn't want.
23253,josh,"No, let's talk about what you're going to do for our underpaid,  underpromoted fighting men and women."
23254,josh,And when were you promised...?
23255,josh,Under the last President?
23256,josh,"Okay, uh, a bunch of things have fallen by the wayside since then, like  communism."
23257,josh,"If you want to come asking for party favors, you shouldn't have voted  with the Republicans for five straight years. You shouldn't have voted  with them last week to kill our stimulus package."
23258,bartlet,"Nancy, I want these to go back to the Staff Secretary."
23259,bartlet,Thank you.
23260,bartlet,Did you hear about the Chief Justice?
23261,leo,What now?
23262,leo,Which is fine if we can get NYU to rule on the second amendment.
23263,bartlet,"He's losing it, Leo."
23264,leo,It's a lifetime appointment.
23265,bartlet,That doesn't mean he gets to decompose on the bench. Are we taking care  of Carrick?
23266,leo,Josh is. There's more on HHS Appropriations. Violence Prevention's now  been doubled.
23267,bartlet,It went from gutted to double?
23268,leo,200 million.
23269,bartlet,Is this a budget problem?
23270,leo,"Legislative Affairs are concerned. It could cut into bioterrorism,  global pandemics. 200 million's real money."
23271,bartlet, You think the Republicans want to make  it so expensive we'll cut it ourselves?
23272,leo,It's possible.
23273,bartlet,Are they trying to outflank us on the left?
23274,leo,I can't see why.
23275,bartlet,Let's find out.
23279,c.j.,Thanks.
23280,c.j.,You can't--you're his subordinate. That's a violation of ethics rule.
23281,c.j.,"You'd better believe you're my subordinate, and I dont think you even  brought a present at all."
23282,c.j.,Are you...?
23283,c.j.,There aren't enough phone books in the District of Columbia for you to  stand on.
23284,leo,How's Carrick?
23285,josh,He wants the MB-827 missile launcher.
23286,leo,The one that doesn't work.
23287,josh,"Yeah. The 97th Airborne's a stickler for that kind of thing, too."
23288,leo,"I got a breakdown on the promotions. Two dozen are headed for field  rotations in the Gulf. If they're not promoted, they can't leave for  the Gulf."
23289,josh,Carrick wants that launcher. He wants a letter today.
23290,leo,I'm going to send Fitzwallace to cut a deal. Call it his farewell tour.
23291,josh,"I've got a better idea. No Fitzwallace, no letter, no deal. Five years  he's voted with Republicans. Just last week he switched his vote and  jammed us on the stimulus package. That's why we're in this mess. We  want to keep rolling over for him?"
23292,leo,"He's a Democrat from Idaho. They use Democrats for target practice up  there. Sometimes, he's got to lean to the right."
23293,josh,"Sometimes. We give him everything, he screws us everytime. this guy  makes Machiavelli look like a social worker."
23294,leo,We need his vote when we bring stimulus up again. We need it on our  whole agenda.
23295,josh,So we award him for rolling us? That'll keep him in line.
23296,leo,We can't afford an ugly fight right now.
23297,josh,"Unless we want more and more of them. We've got to stop feeding the hand  that bites us, Leo. No Fitzwallace, no letter, no deal. I need your  proxy on this."
23298,leo,Okay. But go easy.
23299,josh,"That, uh, ""one-man majority"" stuff? You know they didn't get that from  me?"
23300,leo,I dont care about the Washington Post style section. Take care of  Carrick.
23301,josh,"Call Carrick's Chief of Staff--the launcher's off the table. Tell him...  tell him there's no such thing as a free ""launch""."
23303,josh,Just made it up.
23305,josh,"How about telling me I can see her? I got five minutes for her, and she  can wait in my office all day if necessary."
23307,josh,Fine.
23309,josh,It's a meeting. Would you...? I don't do birthday celebrations.
23311,josh,"My seventh birthday, my parents hired a birthday clown. Big nose,  seltzer bottle, the whole drill. And he just did all his tricks for my  sister. She even got to keep one of his floppy shoes."
23313,josh,Tell Amy's office I'm on my way.
23314,josh,Thanks.
23315,josh,You're telling me to call my mother.
23316,josh,What's the First Lady doing? Why do you need list of Congrsseional  committees?
23317,josh,She's making an end run around the budget process. YOu're not supposed  to...
23318,josh,"Leo's on to whatever you're doing with HHS Appropriations. I practically  lied about it.  Next time, I'm not gonna."
23319,josh,Don't tempt me.
23320,josh,"Oh, like I'm going to get between the Bartlets. Your job is to run it  though the process."
23321,josh,I am the principal's office.
23322,josh,Thanks.
23323,c.j.,The President's only concern is passing his stimulus package to get more  Americans in good jobs. He's hopeful Congress will move his new version  to the floor immediately. Mark?
23324,c.j.,We've set up a whole Wing in the White House to handle his paparazzi.  I'm just hoping for a decent table at the Palm. 
23325,c.j.,Yes?
23326,c.j.,The White House fells the EPA report will reflect administration views.
23327,c.j.,The final report will aly out views on a range of issues.
23328,c.j.,I've addressed that.
23329,c.j.,I don't accept your premise.
23330,c.j.,I'm sure you all look forward to reading the actual report.
23331,c.j.,"If there was interference with an independent report, that was obviously  a mistake."
23332,leo,Margaret!
23333,c.j.," But I assure you, the final report will reflect administration  policy. Sally?"
23334,c.j.,I'll see him.
23335,leo,"If there's something you want to say, say it now. Don't take in into the  room."
23336,c.j.,They had both drafts. There was nothing I could do.
23337,leo,"I gave you the line, who said you could drop it?"
23338,c.j.,Coal is the dirtiest energy on the planet. That's worth censoring out of  a report?
23339,leo,What wasn't in that report was any mention of clean coal. Any mention  of...
23340,c.j.,Clean coal's an industry myth.
23341,leo,They turn it into gas and steam. It's better for the...
23342,c.j.,"Clean coal is like saying ""healthy botulism,"" ""child-safe plutonium""..."
23343,leo,"Tell me the alternative, short of getting people to stop using  electricity."
23344,c.j.,"I don't know, neither does the EPA, but they're trying to tell the truth  and we gagged them, and who gave us the right? Are we surprised our  polls are down? We have a responsibilty to the country. We can't just  spin any line we make up."
23345,leo,"You have a responsibilty to me. When I give you the line, that's the  line."
23346,c.j.,Not when no one will believe it.
23347,leo,"You're going to put out a statement in your own name. It's going to say  what you should have said in that briefing room, that we stand behind  that report."
23348,c.j.,You don't want me to do that.
23349,leo,I do.
23350,c.j.,That's saying I wasn't speaking for this White House.
23351,leo,You weren't.  On my desk within the hour.
23352,bartlet,Violence prevention jumped another 30 million in an hour?
23353,bartlet,Do we know why it's happening? 
23354,bartlet,"Well, do we or don't we?"
23355,leo,What does this mean for the CDC budget?
23356,leo,You want to call the First Lady?
23357,bartlet,No.
23358,bartlet,Don't do anything. Thanks.
23359,leo,"Thank you, sir."
23362,josh,Pierce.
23363,josh,"Your family's had a lot of press attention, right?"
23364,josh,I meant since Reconstruction.
23365,josh,"How do you, you know, deal with it?"
23366,josh,Really?
23367,josh,So answer the question.
23368,josh,Meaning what?
23369,josh, Hey.
23370,toby,"Happy birthday, by the way."
23371,josh,I really don't want you making a big deal out of that.
23372,toby,I was done.
23373,josh,Good.
23374,toby,I walked the Minority Leader through the message calendar.
23375,josh,Triplehorn ought to be jazzed--his pension stuff's on there.
23376,toby,He tells me we're not giving Carrick a missle launcher he very much  wants.
23377,josh,"The Minority Leader wants us to cave, right? If he could manage his own  caucus, we wouldn't have this provlem."
23378,toby,"Well, Carrick's vulnerable in Idaho. We can't win back the Senate  without him."
23379,josh,You're suggesting we build a multi-million-dollar heap of garbage the  DOD doesn't even want?
23380,toby,"Well, sometimes they find other uses for the technology. I-I..."
23381,josh,Great. They can turn it into a toaster that doesn't make toast. This has  zero to do with defense technology.
23382,toby,"The Minority Leader thinks we could lose our best chance to get him on  the new stimulus package, on our tax bill."
23383,josh,It'sa bluff.
23384,toby,"49% job approval isn't the time to go calling bluffs. We got to get off  this, onto our issues."
23385,josh,The stuff that this guy has all ready bilked us for out of a state of  about mime people...
23386,toby,He's an Idaho Democrat. He's an endangered species. If he needs a little  pork...
23387,josh,"The Volcanic Soil Museum, the Canola Oil Feul Cell Initiative..."
23388,toby,It's low-fat pork.
23389,josh,"The Shakespeare in Military Communitues Program. I mean, what's the hell  wrong with Hemingway?"
23390,toby,Maybe we cut our losses.
23391,josh,That's easy for you to say. I'm the one who lost him on stimulus. I'm  the one who has to get him on our agenda. I'm the one lacing up concrete  shoes on the front page of the Post.
23392,toby,Been on a... have you been on a fishing trawler recently?
23393,josh,"Donna! I'm fine on Carrick. Do your job, I'll do mine."
23394,josh,It stinks in here. It's like working in Moby Dick's gym locker.
23396,josh,All night?
23398,josh,Amy?
23399,bartlet,We're doing pretty well on violence prevention.
23400,bartlet,"They were going to gut it, First Lady really turned it around."
23401,bartlet,"Nah, I'm not going to have Abbey jump through hoops."
23402,bartlet,How many calls today?
23403,bartlet,"The First Lady, how many calls did she make to members of the  Sumcommittee today? "
23404,bartlet,"No calls. She's hiking in the White Mountains. She made no calls, you  made them."
23405,bartlet,Don't tell me what she believes.
23406,bartlet,My wife is not a budget appropriation. She's not a line. Don't put words  in her mouth. Don't treat her like she's your blank checkbook.
23407,bartlet,She has to be here to want things... and you don't have to be here at  all.
23408,toby,I said blue. Blue. Green is the color of money. This is about people's  lives.
23409,toby,"Just stick to black and white. I fact, quill and parchment's okay. I  need this for the Treasury Secretary. "
23410,toby,Did you get the VP's sign-off?
23412,toby,What did you get exactly?
23415,toby,"Russell's an empty cowboy suit, you work for the leader of the free  world."
23417,toby,The calendar. I need the calendar.
23419,toby,What did you tell Russell about the job?
23421,toby,You're not considering it.
23423,toby,You are not considering it.
23425,toby,"You think I want to be making calendars? You think I like being in a PR  dogfight with Congress, writing banner copy for photo ops?!"
23426,toby,Calendar's aren't... It's a calendar. Make it look like a calendar. How  hard is that?  This is the NBA. You don't go back to shirts and  skins.
23427,josh,"Okay, let's talk about the fish. You don't understand this building."
23428,josh,"I'm talking about a code, an ethos you don't understand."
23429,josh,"The Post profile, the ""legislative juggernaut,"" all those anecdotes, all  those quotes came from you."
23430,josh,We don't glorify ourselves. How is the President going to feel when I've  got better press than him? How's every punk congressional staffer going  to feel when I'm taking victory laps the week after losing a key vote?
23431,josh,We don't advertise. It's not the code.
23432,josh,"The only constituency that matters in this building is the constituency  of one--the guy in the round room, and that's who you and I work for."
23433,josh,You serve the issue by serving the man.
23434,josh,What are you talking about?
23435,josh,HHS Appropriations.
23436,josh,Apologize. You got to go apologize.
23437,josh,"Hang on. Just hang on a second, okay?"
23439,josh,What?
23441,josh,Unless the meeting's to strap Chris Carrick to his idiot missile  launcher and fling him head first into an ICBM--which he'll miss--then...
23443,josh,I'm making it public.
23445,josh,"I'm leaking to every newspaper in the known universe that Carrick's  blocking military promotions, for a hunk of pork barrel, defense-  industrial scrap metal."
23447,josh,I'm calling his bluff. I'm making him crawl down here on his knees. I'll  be in the press office.
23448,toby,Sorry about before. You have a future here. We should talk about it.
23450,toby,"My portfolio, the speeches, the day-to-day, I'm going to give it to you."
23452,toby,I'm stepping back to do big-think-- work in the legacy.
23454,toby,It's a Commonwealth.
23456,toby,We'll figure it out.
23458,toby,Why not?
23460,toby,You took the Russell job. This isn't line on a resume. None of us... you  don't walk away.
23462,toby,"Yeah, well, maybe we'll print up t-shirts."
23463,leo,Your statement on the coal thing?
23464,c.j.,It just went out.
23465,leo,There's a typo in the...
23466,c.j.,Carol caught it.
23467,leo,Okay.
23468,c.j.,Is that all?
23469,leo,"I don't like coal any more than you do. But sometime tomorrow, we're  going to get the full results of that poll, and I'm going to have to  fix the President a drink and tell him his numbers are crumbling--that  the dogs don't like the dog food--on the eve of a big budget fight."
23470,c.j.,I know.
23471,leo,"We attack the coal industry, and however many thousand coal miners and  what's our answer? Nuclear? Drill on the Arctic? 40% unemployment in  West Virginia."
23472,c.j.,No.
23473,leo,"Like it or not, we're the Saudi Arabia of coal. Coal's what we got."
23474,c.j.,"The EPA's an independent agency, Leo."
23475,leo,"The day we don't get blamed for their screw ups, that's when we count  'em as independent."
23476,c.j.,I disagree.
23477,leo,Okay.
23478,c.j.,And holding your line makes it a two or three-day story at the least.  The whole room thinks we screwed up whether we admit it or not.
23479,leo,You made that point.
23480,c.j.,"I appreciate your apology, but if I'm going to fullfill my duty to the  country, I don't just need to know what you're thinking. I need to know  that you're listening to me when I say you made a mistake."
23481,leo,"I am... I'm not apologizing to you. I'm telling you my thinking as a  courtesy. But you work for me. When I make a decision, that's the  decision. If you can't back it up, don't go in the Briefing Room."
23482,c.j.,We're here to serve the country.
23483,leo,We are the country.
23484,bartlet,"Thanks, Charlie. "
23485,bartlet,The Flemish Bloc is gaining in the north.
23486,bartlet,"The Flemish Bloc. The Flemish Bloc, ultra-nationalist in Belgium.  Skinheads, really, neo-nazis. They're wearing three-piece suits,  speaking in coded discourse now instead of angry chants, and they're  gaining in the north. When everyone wears the same suit, how does anyone  know which side they're on anymore?"
23487,bartlet,You're not fired. Abbey would choose you over me anyway.
23488,bartlet,She didn't... I didn't talk to Abbey about this. Zoey told me she was  hiking.
23489,bartlet,Tell 'em the First Lady wants violence prevention fully funded.
23490,bartlet,Make it a 110.
23491,toby,You were looking for me?
23492,leo,What did you want to talk about with the President?
23493,toby,"Did I forget the secret password?  We talked about my  giving up communications, leaving it to Will and focusing on big-picture."
23494,leo,This is not the time?
23495,toby,"When will it be the time?  Message of the day, top of the news  hour, our second term and we're acting like a losing campaign."
23496,leo,You're not going in there to lecture him.
23497,toby,Stop protecting him.
23498,leo,It's my job to protect him. It's your job to get us back on message.
23499,toby,Will can do it. I'll supervise him.
23500,leo,You supervise him now.
23501,toby,What does that matter?
23502,leo,It matters 'cause I need you doing what you're doing now.  I'm  holding this together with scotch tape and baling wire.
23503,toby,We have an economic policy held together with scotch tape and baling  wire. FDR built the middle class in a hundred days. How many days do  we even have left?
23504,leo,49%. We can't start another New Deal.
23505,toby,"How about fighting for the old one, instead of haggling with Republicans  over how much to cut? We created nine million jobs. Now they're  disappearing. Outsourcing, downsizing, buyouts. They build T.V.'s in  Mexico for a dollar a day, on dirt floors with cardbaord  walls..."
23506,leo,And that's our fault?
23507,toby,"It's on our watch, Leo. Where's our hundred days? Where's our Great  Society? Where's our New Frontier? Somebody's got to do what we came  here to do. Those jobs aren't coming back. We lose our cave every battle  we have with Congress, and we have a calendar, not a plan."
23508,leo,Will's going to work for the Vice President.
23509,toby,I'm asking the President not to let him.
23510,leo,He told Russell he could have him. It's done. 
23511,leo,You got a problem with your job?
23512,leo,Never mind.
23513,josh,"Hey, anything from Amy?"
23515,josh,Okay.
23517,josh,"Not exactly, no."
23519,josh,I think she's been fired--she thinks so. I-I kind of unloaded on her.
23521,josh,"She'll be... ah, I don't know what she'll be."
23523,josh,What else have I got?
23525,josh,Chris Carrick's here? Now?
23526,josh,Senator.
23527,josh,What can I do for you?
23528,josh,I hope that lesson won't be lost when our new stimulus package hits the  floor.
23529,josh,Good.
23530,josh,What's that?
23531,josh,What's this?
23532,josh,Come again?
23533,josh,You're switching parties 'cause we won't give you a launcher that  doesn't even...
23534,josh,You can't be serious...
23535,josh,"We can't win back the Senate without Idaho. We can't pass the tax bill,  the new stimulus package. I'll get you a meeting with Fitzwallace.  A meeting with the President."
23536,josh,You're leaving the party be... this is 'cause of me?!
23537,toby,"Okay, here it is. Chief Justice Roy Ashland may not be enlarged in death beyond what  he was in life: an idealist, not an icon, a man, not a monument... "
23538,toby,...a believer in the irreducible power of the law to shape our society.
23539,c.j.,"Okay, but I gotta be careful about saying 'man.'"
23540,c.j.,"You'd be surprised, I get letters."
23541,toby,"Fine. Human being then, or do the other mammals complain?"
23543,toby,Who said you could come in here?
23545,toby,"Oh, you had the flu."
23547,toby,"Granit, Keith, and Toland. And no, we're not talking about it."
23550,c.j.,Counsel's office.
23552,c.j.,Yet another researcher quit.
23554,c.j.,The third since you quit.
23556,toby,Are you still here?
23558,toby,Leave.
23559,c.j.,You seem... happy.
23560,toby,Excuse me?
23561,c.j.,"Happy. You know, sensation your fellow mammalians occasionally experience."
23562,toby,"Haffley's treating the discretionary budget like a chew toy. We're about to cave on tax  cuts for billionaires and who the hell knows what else... Angela Blake is giving away  in there.  But you know what, we're going to appoint a new chief  justice. Breathe new life into the Constitution. Do you know how rare that is? The last  five guys didn't get to do it. We're gonna shape the future of jurisprudence, the laws  that sustain our whole society, or shove somebody in there to strike down these  God-awful excuses for laws the Republicans are passing."
23564,toby,Enough already. Buffalo Bob is not going to pick the next Chief Justice.
23566,josh,Donna!
23567,josh,Do you have any of those pills left from that naval doctor?
23569,josh,The cold and sinus stuff?
23571,josh,It was Harry Chaipman. Those big blue ones.
23573,josh,C.J.'s making that up.
23575,josh,"No. Nothing natural. I need the industrial strength, full-throttle stuff."
23577,josh,About what?
23579,josh,I don't know anything.
23582,josh,You should've said I was in the Oval. Didn't it occur to you to say I was in the Oval?
23585,josh,"Fortunately Pa and I brought in the last of the winter wheat yesterday, so I don't have  to operate the combine."
23587,josh,Get another continuing resolution.
23589,josh,"The Republican majority, but you're close."
23591,josh,"Well, you're forgetting the beauty of the federal budget process."
23593,josh,No one understands it.
23595,c.j.,Did you take the call?
23596,c.j.,He works for Diane Mathers.
23597,c.j.,The ecstasy? Did you talk to him about it?
23598,c.j.,"It's okay, you did the right thing."
23599,c.j.,"Nothing. I've got it from here. Thanks, Charlie."
23600,toby,He's not returning the President's calls?
23601,leo,"He's in intensive care, I don't think they have a lot of phones in there."
23602,toby,Intensive care? I thought it was... CNN said it was exhaustion. 
23603,leo,Yeah.
23604,toby,How do we know he's not...?
23605,leo,We don't.
23606,toby,He's 84.
23607,leo,So? My grandfather lived to be 90.
23608,toby,"My grandfather lived to be 96 but the last 20 years he thought the Hapsburgs still  lived in a palace in Vienna. How long before this gets dangerous, Leo? Before we've  got a cadaver up there ruling on when life begins?"
23609,leo, He's been a life-long ally of the President.
23610,toby,"We're talking about an empty robe, and I don't like this any more than you do. If Roy  Ashland were a religion, I'd convert. But what happens if we wait until he's senile,  or ends up in a coma? Then what? We go to our Republican Congress to impeach? Haffley'll  never do that! He'll leave Ashland on a respirator until one of their guys is wearing  the windbreaker on Air Force One."
23612,leo,"They were in there last night till midnight, back this morning at six."
23614,leo,Apparently they're closer on maritime subsidies.
23616,leo,It was already a mess. Angela's going to make the best deal she can and try to get us  out of there in one piece.
23617,toby,"The chief justice won't take the President's calls, maybe we need to send someone over  there."
23618,leo,"What, just show up with a bunch of balloons and some peanut brittle?"
23619,toby,"It's time to get Ashland off the bench, Leo."
23621,leo,What's this about you breaking somebody's coffee mug?
23622,toby,What?
23623,leo,"Personnel says another one of your researchers quit, that you broke her mug."
23624,toby,It got in the way of a misfiled copy of the Congressional record.
23625,leo,You were refilling with your throwing arm?
23626,toby,Can we get back to the chief justice?
23627,leo,"No. What is this, the fourth researcher this month?"
23629,leo, Stop breaking things. I don't need the victims of hippo-gate filing class  action suits.
23630,bartlet, It's going to be a brisk 42 tomorrow. Time to break out that  Irish fishing sweater that C.J. says makes me look like an Irish fisherman.
23631,c.j., Oh no!
23632,josh,I'm past the infectious stage.
23633,c.j.," Excuse me, sir, if I may, this Diane Mathers interview..."
23634,bartlet,You still have a problem?
23635,c.j.,Yes I do...
23636,bartlet,Abbey thinks it'll be fine.
23637,c.j.,"Yes, sir..."
23638,bartlet,"I think so too. Where's Angela, Leo?"
23639,leo,"They were here most of the night, came back first thing this morning."
23640,bartlet,She knew this was at ten?
23641,leo,She'll be here in a minute.
23642,bartlet,What else?
23643,toby,"Sir, the Chief Justice still isn't returning calls."
23644,bartlet,"Yeah, I tried him a couple of times. They're saying it was exhaustion now?"
23645,toby,"Yes, sir, but we can't get anyone to confirm it. His doctors are referring us back to  his office."
23646,bartlet,"Roy was a great friend, a great man."
23647,toby,If his medical condition prevents him from performing his duties as...
23648,bartlet,He's the best judge of his capacities.
23649,josh,"Sorry, I just took this sinus stuff. I think I just lost the hearing in my... my left  ear."
23650,leo,"Oh, for God... God bless you."
23651,c.j.,Sorry. I'm not getting it.
23652,josh,I'm actually getting over it.
23654,bartlet,So where are we?
23655,toby,Excuse me? What are we talking about?
23656,toby,When was tuition put on the table?!
23657,c.j.,It was a major campaign promise.
23658,toby,"It was the centerpiece of our re-elect!  Josh, you just going to sit  there?"
23659,josh, You gotta trust the person in the room.
23660,bartlet,"Can we do this, Angela?"
23661,bartlet,Without the deficit topping 200 billion?
23662,bartlet," Then everything else is on the table. Thanks everyone, that's it."
23663,bartlet,200 billion dollar deficit and Haffley wants tax cuts. Take away a few zeroes and he'd  pass for a mob accountant.
23664,c.j.,"I'm sorry, Mister President, but I don't think Zoey should do this interview."
23665,bartlet,The Diane Mathers thing again?
23666,c.j.,Charlie got a phone call from one of Mathers' producers. They got his statement to the  Secret Service about Zoey considering taking the ecstasy and I think they might have  Jean-Paul telling his side of the story.
23667,bartlet,Abbey thinks Zoey can handle it.
23668,c.j.,"Diane Mathers is very good at her job. Sir, if you won't let me cancel it, at least  let me go up there, make sure she's prepared, run some interference."
23669,leo,Take the earliest flight up tomorrow.
23670,c.j.,"Thank you, Mister President. "
23671,leo,"If you'd like sir, you could travel up with C.J., we could check with advance."
23672,bartlet, And Abbey? Who's going to check with her?
23673,leo,On the Chief Justice?
23674,bartlet,Hmm?
23675,leo,The Chief? Do you think we should try to...?
23676,bartlet,Yeah. It's time.
23677,leo,"Thank you, sir."
23678,bartlet,Leo. Do it delicately.
23679,josh, Yeah.
23680,josh,"Yeah, we started a couple of months ago."
23681,josh,"I got the governors coming in on emission standards, the Japan trip..."
23682,josh,Donna Moss. Okay. Sure.
23683,toby,You were looking for me?
23684,toby,"Deductible tuition! What's next? We could save a few bucks by shutting the east wing,  turn the south lawn into the mother of all garage sales."
23685,leo,We're facing our third CR.
23686,toby,"It's process, Leo! Two months from now no one will give a damn about continuing  resolutions!"
23687,leo,You wanted more responsibility?
23688,toby,What about it?
23689,leo,The Chief Justice. The president knows it's time.
23690,toby,That's not so simple.
23691,leo,That's why I'm giving it to you.
23692,toby,We can't force him to resign.
23693,leo,"Yeah. No, we can't."
23694,toby,"Hey, Joe?"
23695,toby,Good. You?
23696,toby,You used to clerk for the Chief Justice. That's interesting.
23697,toby,I've just never heard you mention it. Guys around here with two-bit appellate  courtships staple it to their foreheads.
23698,toby,You haven't even heard what I'm going to say.
23699,toby,I didn't say that.
23700,toby,I see.
23701,toby,I see.
23702,toby,The President sets the direction of the Court. I've read the Constitution too.
23703,toby,"You don't have to ask him to resign, only to sit down with the President."
23705,josh,"Yeah, I authorized it."
23707,josh,Yeah.
23709,josh,We can call her Angela now.
23711,josh,Sure. Did we ever get specifics for...?
23713,c.j.,"...I need HHS public affairs, DPC, Toby, and Will to walk them through the talking  points, any key developments on the Hill. I have to phone AP and the Post...   Carol?"
23714,c.j.,I was just talking to her...
23715,c.j.,I love Macy Gray.
23716,c.j.,How about some John Phillips Sousa?
23717,c.j.,Yeah?
23718,c.j.,"This is a woman who gets dictators to cry, talk about their love of puppies and momma's  cooking, confess they had the concentration camps built because they couldn't get a  date for the prom."
23719,c.j.,So everyone keeps saying. The President hasn't changed his mind about coming?
23720,c.j.,I thought he would in the end.
23728,toby,No. We're going in here.
23729,toby,"I'm curious. It wouldn't be for the obvious reason, would it?"
23730,toby,You're a conservative. Maybe you'd love to see him stay on the bench. A liberal icon  reduced to a quivering mass of octogenarian confusion!
23731,toby,Hanging on until he can be replaced by a paleo Republican! The Constitution's a living  document. You stick to it like it's a boiler plate lease!
23732,toby,Okay.
23733,toby,He has memory lapses. He drifts during oral arguments.
23734,toby,"The associate Justices are already postponing decisions, holding over important cases,  going behind his back to assign opinions!"
23735,toby,"Yeah, I do. There's no one else left, Joe. He's outlived his wife, his son was shot  down over Hanoi. There's just his clerks, clerks like you."
23736,toby,"Let's go over there together right now, you and me."
23737,toby,"He'll see you. You tell me he's okay, and I'll call off the vultures."
23738,toby,I just came along to keep Joe company. I saw a coffee cart in the lobby. You want  anything?
23739,toby,Lisa?
23740,toby,I'll be downstairs when you're done.
23741,toby,Joe?
23742,toby,What'd he say? How is he? Was he coherent?
23743,toby,So he's alright?
23744,toby,"Your side does it better, pushing neo-conservatives in swaddling clothes, hoping they  don't grow a conscience, let alone a meager understanding of jurisprudence."
23745,toby, What did he'd say? Or can he even speak?
23746,josh,Good!
23747,josh,"Flat glass, excellent!"
23748,josh,"It's a new thing I'm doing, sort of a positive attitude thing."
23749,josh,Still?
23750,josh, Donna's in the budget negotiations?
23751,josh, Outstanding!
23752,toby, I think I'm coming down with something.
23753,toby,"You say that, but in a way that makes me wonder if you really are."
23754,toby,I was in a room with Ashland once.
23755,toby,I was a student at City College. Student organizing committee got him to give a speech  about the history of voting rights. We were hanging from the rafters.
23756,toby,"I talked to him afterwards. I mean, he wouldn't remember me. But I spent the next six  weeks organizing a voter registration drive. You know when you go out West how they  say, don't miss the Grand Canyon, it's one of the few things in life that when you see  it, it doesn't disappoint? That's Roy Ashland."
23757,toby," I don't want to see him gone, Joe. I want nine Ashlands on the court. I just-I  just wish he was 40 years younger."
23758,c.j.,"Diane likes to keep things warm, casual, but she'll try to zing you with some indirect  attribution like ""People say,"" or ""There's a rumor that."" "
23760,c.j.,There's a rumor that you're seeing a therapist.
23762,c.j.," If you don't answer, she'll just wait, like an infinitely forgiving,  infinitely patient cross between the Virgin Mary and a schnouzer."
23764,c.j.,Okay.
23765,c.j.,The help's helped.
23766,c.j.,"Zoey, we need to take a moment and talk about that night at the club with Jean-Paul.  Had you agreed to take drugs?"
23767,josh,What's going on?
23768,leo,"We're having a bit of a breakdown. If ""breakdown"" is the word."
23769,josh,What happened?
23770,josh,"So, what now?"
23771,josh,"You've got to be kidding. You let it drag on that long, they'll try to de-fund the  Yule log."
23772,josh,How could this happen?
23773,leo, Josh.
23774,josh,"No, Leo. How is this acceptable? Haffley's not the Prime Minister. You take this to  the President, you know what he'll say?"
23775,leo,He'll say yes.
23776,josh,How can you say that?
23777,leo,To keep the lights on. To make sure a couple million federal employees keep on getting  paid. It's two more months.
23778,josh,"This isn't governing, it's duck and cover."
23779,leo,"He'll say that, too."
23780,josh,At least be...
23781,josh,I don't know. Embarrassed.
23783,josh,What?
23785,josh,You're saying it was me.
23788,josh,It's nice when you make new friends.
23789,josh,It's not a bad plan.
23790,toby,Now what?
23791,leo,Another continuing resolution to take us through the holidays.
23792,toby,So now we won't have a budget until we're up against the State of the Union.
23793,leo,Anything on Ashland?
23794,toby,He's coming over to see the President.
23795,leo,When?
23796,toby,Now.
23797,leo,You're kidding.
23798,toby,I just got off the phone with Joe Quincy.
23799,leo,"Well, that's great."
23800,toby,Leo. We gave away college tuition for nothing.
23801,leo,Good work on the Chief Justice.
23803,c.j.,She'll be wrapping up. That was her big gun.
23805,c.j.,"You, too."
23807,c.j.,I meant you've raised a remarkable young woman.
23809,c.j.," Mrs. Bartlet, may I say, we miss you."
23811,c.j.,"It's been very busy. The budget, Japan in a few weeks, and the Chief Justice... "
23813,leo,Mr. Chief Justice.
23814,toby, Thank you.
23815,bartlet, Chief.
23816,bartlet,"Well, yes, there's something going around."
23817,bartlet,"I'm glad to see you doing so well, sir."
23818,bartlet,"Yes, I am."
23819,bartlet,"I don't want to. But if it's time, if your condition warrants."
23820,bartlet,I'd hoped to consult with you.
23821,bartlet,Holmes?
23822,bartlet,"The other eight are preparing to take it away from you, Roy. Holding over cases, the  major decisions. How long can the country wait?"
23823,bartlet,Then give me a name.
23825,josh,They all here?
23827,josh, Go.
23828,josh,Go.
23829,leo, The President is finishing up a meeting. He'll be right in.
23830,leo,That's the meeting.
23831,leo,Came straight from his adjustable bed. Man's a force of nature.
23832,bartlet,"Mr. Speaker, Senator."
23833,bartlet,"Yes, thanks, Robert. And thanks for saying it this time. I think I had to make that  little speech the last time around."
23834,bartlet,"Or maybe the time before. This is our third CR, our third time coming up short. We  have to do better. People aren't paying us to duck the hard choices. You want to run  through the details, Angela?"
23835,bartlet,Hold on.
23836,bartlet,Only one percent.
23837,bartlet,We had a deal at one percent.
23838,bartlet,What's next?
23839,bartlet,"In two months. Five percent? 50? How many rounds do we go, Jeff? I'm just asking."
23840,bartlet,No.
23841,bartlet,And I said no.
23842,bartlet,Then shut it down.
23843,bartlet,And I said no.
23844,bartlet,Then shut it down.
23845,bartlet,Mr. Speaker.
23848,toby,What happened?
23850,josh,How far apart are we?
23854,toby,We had a deal at one percent!
23855,josh,He's bluffing.
23856,josh,It's only 8:30. We'll get a deal before midnight.
23858,toby,I'm gonna... 
23859,josh,Yeah.
23860,leo,"Sir, you want to talk about what just happened?"
23861,bartlet, You were there. Make sure Nancy sees me in the morning about the ?  in Indonesia. I don't want any training East of Kupan. Anything else?
23862,leo,"We need a continuing resolution by midnight of 940,000 federal employees  aren't going to show up in the morning."
23863,bartlet,"Give them your shirt, they want your built."
23864,bartlet,Not tonight.  Damn! I probably missed the first half. Providence is  going to get a whopping from my fighting Irish.
23865,leo,What do you need?
23866,josh,What the hell happened?
23867,toby,Now what?
23868,leo,We shut it down.
23869,leo,Listen up. Hey. 
23870,leo," Effective immediately, the U.S. government is shut  down. We have no operating budget, so all non-essential personnel, anyone below special  assistant, non-national security and public safety, go home until further notice. The  President thanks you for your hard work and service. Questions?"
23872,leo,"Hours, probably, maybe a day."
23873,leo,Maybe.
23874,leo,"It will last as long as it lasts. Listen guys, I'm sorry."
23875,c.j.,Are they coming back tonight?
23876,toby,I sure as hell hope so.
23877,c.j.,"Amtrak, the courts, federal prisons, border patrol, national weather service, all open,  and meat inspectors will remain on the job."
23878,toby, Nothing jeopardizes the sanctity of the American hamburger.
23879,c.j.,The EPA is suspending 60 percent of factory inspections. Good news for polluters.
23880,toby,Now tell me.
23881,c.j.," We had agreed to a one percent cut on a 30 day continuing  resolution, but the Speaker pulled a bait-and-switch."
23882,toby," One percent, two percent, what's so unreasonable about  three percent?"
23883,c.j.,"Three percent equals X dollars, which is Y flu vaccinations, Z school lunches. "
23884,c.j.,It's more convincing with numbers. Carol!
23885,toby, I'll get you the numbers.
23886,c.j., He's on the front lawn?!
23887,c.j.,Is there anyone left?
23888,c.j.,Should I wait for Haffley to finish?
23889,toby,We gotta start reclaiming some ground.
23890,c.j.,"Okay, but I need some numbers fast, maybe some garlic and a crucifix."
23891,toby, Go home.
23892,c.j.,"Good evening everybody. Katie, get back here. Let's start with the good news. National  security and public safety will not be affected."
23894,josh,Yeah.
23896,josh,You do realize you're not a special assistant.
23898,josh," Donna, listen carefully. You have to go home."
23901,josh,He meant you.
23902,toby,Your phones are ringing.
23903,leo,Yeah. Margaret went home.
23904,toby,What's the President doing?
23905,leo,Watching basketball.
23906,toby,Does he have a plan?
23907,leo,I think it was pretty spontaneous.
23908,toby," If it doesn't end now, it'll become a referendum on the Bartlet  Presidency."
23909,leo, Yup.
23910,toby,Do you want me to talk to him?
23911,leo,"No, I've got it."
23912,c.j.,George.
23913,c.j.,"Well, I can't speak for Congress, but the President will not cut essential services,  which is what their CR does."
23914,c.j.," Three percent equals more than a billion dollars in education  funding, clean energy funding, highway safety, to name a few. I'll get you exact  figures."
23915,c.j.,It wasn't the will of the 196 congressmen and 16 senators who voted against all 14  appropriations bills.
23917,josh,Why don't you just take them on disk?
23919,josh,Not unless you want three federal agents trailing you home.
23921,josh,I can survive for a day.
23923,josh,"Okay, take my laptop."
23924,josh,"Start a tally of programs affected by the shutdown, and email it to me as you go.  Don't read anything in the folder marked ""private."" "
23925,josh,Don't take my laptop. 
23927,josh,You remember when we went to Atlantic City?
23929,josh,"Remember when I went to Atlantic City and I came back complaining that all the pro  poker players suck all the fun out of the game, no cigars, no pizza, no beer."
23931,josh,"Those guys, they bet the bank when they have a good hand. And you either fold, or you  go in all the way with them. I think the President's gonna stay in."
23933,josh,He's better than anyone we've seen on the other side of the table in a long time. 
23934,josh,"Hey, advisory board still at ten tomorrow?"
23935,leo,Yeah. Treasury is worried about the debt ceiling.
23936,josh,"I left word with violence prevention and business roundtable, but what about the  address to the NAACP tomorrow? Should we cancel? It's non-governmental, we'll need  advance."
23937,leo,Don't cancel anything yet. Angela thinks we'll get an agreement tonight.
23938,toby, What kind of agreement?
23939,leo,And tomorrow?
23940,josh, We have to call Haffley out for what he's really doing. It's a coup. He's  trying to de-fund every Bartlet initiative we passed in the last two years.
23941,leo," The President has a full schedule tomorrow, Josh. Go make sure everyone knows  he intends to keep it."
23942,leo,Can we downplay this to the press?
23943,toby,"That's what Haffley wants. 940,000 federal employees out of work, but we say, no  worries, doesn't matter."
23945,leo,Angela had the thing wired and Haffley tried to roll us. It was a mugging.
23947,leo,Are you speaking for the Vice President?
23949,c.j.,Help.
23950,leo,Don't go out there again until morning.
23951,c.j.,"Okay, but the enemy's advancing, and you better give me more than a squirt gun before  the sun comes up."
23953,toby,The mess is closed. There's no coffee.
23954,c.j.,Starbucks closes at 7:00. Try Swaine's at 17th and G.
23955,leo,What else?
23956,c.j.,The British Prime Minister...
23957,leo,Isn't visiting for four days. One day at a time.
23958,c.j.,"It's a state dinner, 216 guests, formal attire..."
23959,leo,Josh can handle it. What else?
23960,toby,"We can put together a strategy, but Leo, there isn't anything else until we sign a  deal."
23961,bartlet,Come in!
23962,leo,"Good evening, sir."
23963,bartlet,"Hey, grab a seat."
23964,leo,What's the score?
23965,bartlet,Doesn't matter. The game is won or lost in the last five minutes.
23966,leo,So the Irish are down.
23967,leo,"Sir, I've got Angela running the war room, but we don't have a lot of support inside or  outside the building."
23968,leo,Angela feels they'll close at 2 percent.
23969,bartlet,"I took his Vice President, I dropped my stimulus package, my college tuition tax credit,  and now we're haggling not over the budget, but over how much to cut."
23970,leo,"It's a bad deal, a bad week, a bad year. But our approval's in the 30s and we're out of  allies on the hill. Let's get past this budget cycle, make a deal at 2 percent tonight,  not let it become a noose around our necks. Then, we can get back on message, be bold  at the State of the Union, take back Congress."
23971,bartlet,Dammit! They've got a seven foot center and best power center in the game. Why zone?
23972,leo,It's not always enough to be right sir.
23973,leo,How'd the press react to your closing down the briefing room?
23974,c.j.,Let's just say it hasn't won me any new friends in the media.
23975,leo,This thing will be won or lost depending on how it plays on TV. 
23976,c.j.,They're blaming us.
23977,leo,Any change in the overnights?
23978,c.j.,"They keep saying they're Scrooge, denying the needy. They say we're addicted to  spending. Both our negatives are up, but ours more."
23979,c.j.,You see Newsweek?
23980,leo,Beats the cover of Time.
23981,c.j.,"The Post is reporting 193,000 veterans can't get their home loans processed. We can't  be doing this over the holidays."
23982,leo,We won't be.
23983,c.j.,So what's the plan?
23984,leo,Plan? Who said we had a plan?
23985,leo,"Of course, Mr. Vice President, please.  I'll see you at the thing?"
23986,leo,He's fighting a cold.
23987,leo,"Mmm, not yet sir, no."
23988,leo,I appreciate that.
23989,leo," With all due respect sir, we can't send mixed signals."
23990,leo, The President will decide the terms.
23991,leo," Thanks for the history lesson, sir. I'll be sure to pass it on to  the President."
23992,toby,Excuse me?
23993,toby," No, thank you, I've got it."
23995,leo,"So, where are we?"
23996,toby,Did you see the Post/ABC poll this morning?
23997,leo,Yeah.
23998,leo,Who's that?
23999,toby, A walking lawsuit.
24000,c.j.,Where are we on the state dinner?
24001,leo,Still on for the schedule.
24002,c.j.,"Except we don't have food, chefs, or help."
24003,leo,Josh is coordinating with the British. We still have another day before we have to  decide.
24004,c.j.,Not according to Time.
24005,leo,How'd it go with the minority leader?
24007,toby,And Haffley is running the government.
24008,leo,Okay. Today is the day.  and the minority leader and  contact Haffley to make sure we can still get a deal at three percent.
24010,leo,"12 hours passed, that's what happened.  Tell the speaker we're taking their  temperature but the President isn't involved yet."
24011,toby,And that has the rare quality of also being true.
24012,leo,I want a continuing resolution by the close of business.
24013,bartlet, No!
24014,leo,"It's a good deal. Three percent on the CR, and we live to fight another day."
24015,bartlet,One percent like we'd agreed.
24016,leo,"Sir, we're not going to get one percent. We need to get past this. Focus on the future.  House Democrats aren't gonna stick. They have to head home for the holidays and defend  why we shut down the federal government..."
24017,bartlet,No.
24018,leo,Sir? You're putting all our chips down on a single hand we can't win.
24019,bartlet,"We had a deal, Leo."
24020,josh,Whoa.
24021,josh,"Sure, thanks. Rina, right?"
24022,josh,You Greek? 
24023,josh,How'd you get here?
24024,josh,"No, I mean why weren't you laid off like everyone else?"
24027,josh,So that list of shutdown effects you faxed?
24029,josh,Why'd you put social security on the list? It's an entitlement.
24031,josh,The checks won't go out.
24033,josh,It's considered coercion if you come back to work as a volunteer.
24035,josh,AARP considers you essential.
24037,josh,I'll lend you money.
24039,josh,You're right. Get a cheaper apartment.
24041,josh,Tell me about it.
24043,josh,I don't need calligraphy. He knows where my office is.
24046,toby,That's what the people who get their checks every month think.
24047,c.j.,"Well, that's one way to make the shutdown seem real to the country: don't mail 11  million checks."
24049,toby,FDR will rise from the dead.
24051,toby,Josh is on it.
24053,toby,Josh is taking care of it.
24054,leo,We still have their offer.
24056,leo,He has to.
24057,toby,"Yeah, but will he?"
24058,leo,Desperate times call for desperate measures. I made a call.
24060,c.j.,Really?
24061,leo,Yeah.
24065,bartlet,Apparently it worked.
24067,bartlet,"The mess is closed. When this is gone, I'm going to have to start in on the grandkid's  elbow macaroni."
24069,bartlet,"Yeah, there's something going around. They said your motorcade arrived an hour ago.  Where you been?"
24071,bartlet,Oh?
24073,bartlet,Haffley reneged on the deal.
24076,bartlet, Haffley came to us with a deal?
24079,bartlet,Staying through the holidays?
24082,leo,The President wants you back in the war room.
24083,c.j.,I'm on my way outside for the briefing. Anything new?
24084,toby,Time/CBS has us down another six points.
24085,c.j.,I don't think I'm going to bring that up. Josh still in there with Leo and Angela?
24086,toby,"Or maybe it's twelve or thirteen, I've lost count."
24087,c.j.,"Toby, we've all been assuming this is the President not understanding what's really  going on. He's been so out of it since Zoey, you know, and we've all been protecting  him, you, me, Leo. But what if it's something else?"
24088,toby,It's not.
24089,c.j.,But what if it is?
24090,toby,"Republicans have us and they know it. He and Josh are the only ones who don't. Okay,  it's something else, like what?"
24091,c.j.,Leadership.
24092,josh,The President's already said that three percent is unacceptable.
24093,josh,"Three days, three years, it's still unacceptable!"
24094,toby,"One percent, three percent, five percent, the CR is nothing if we never get around to  passing a budget!"
24095,josh,We can use Royce...
24097,bartlet,"Who's coming to Jesus, Leo, me or you?"
24098,bartlet,Three percent. 60 days. 
24099,bartlet,Toby?
24100,toby,People are frustrated with both parties. It's a plague on both our houses.
24101,leo,"We gave it three days to turn in our favor, sir. It didn't."
24102,bartlet,Josh?
24103,josh,"What do you want, Mr. President?"
24104,bartlet,I want to be able to govern.
24105,josh,Let's go up to the Hill to see them.
24106,toby,We can't go to the Hill. We'll look even more desperate.
24107,josh,The country's waiting for someone to step up. It should be us.
24108,leo,"Sir, if we go to Haffley's office it will set a dangerous precedent for future  negotiations."
24109,bartlet, Let's go.
24110,leo,"Mr. President, you have a video conference with Admiral Vackey of Pac-com at 5:00."
24111,bartlet,Then I suggest we get a move on.
24112,leo,Go. 
24113,c.j.,Sharlene.
24114,c.j.,I want to reiterate that the talks are ongoing; just not formal negotiations.
24115,c.j.,We're talking about negotiating. George?
24116,c.j.,"I certainly hope not, I bought a shiny new Donna Karan and I'll be very disappointed  if it has to stay in my closet. Mark?"
24117,c.j.,You want me to comment on the weather?
24118,c.j.,"I don't know, IHOP? Thank you, everybody."
24119,c.j., Yeah?
24120,josh,"Hey, where are you?"
24121,c.j.,I just finished the gaggle.
24122,josh,"Get back to the press corps. POTUS is going up to the Hill. We're gonna pay a surprise  visit to Haffley. C.J., did you hear me?"
24123,c.j.,"Okay, I got it."
24124,josh,He's only been speaker for a few months. He's in over his head.
24125,josh,And nothing we've done has surprised him.
24126,bartlet," Kansas plates. That's a long way to  travel to find a ""closed"" sign."
24127,bartlet, Hello!
24128,josh,Yeah.
24129,c.j.,You there yet?
24130,josh,We stopped to address a group of tourists.
24131,c.j.,The President is talking to tourists?
24132,josh,"Yeah, the bus says Kansas... Blue Jays, Jayhawks, whatever the hell."
24133,c.j.,"You wait another 30 seconds and he'll also be addressing NBC, ABC, and CNN."
24134,josh,Yeah?
24135,c.j.,"Next to you, they're going to interrupt ""Days of our Lives."""
24136,josh,Thanks.  How long a walk would you say it is from  here to Haffley's office?
24137,josh,Secret Service's going to love this.
24138,bartlet," During the campaign, I visited the Westford Rehabiliation Center  there. They're closed today, too because of the shutdown. But if Congress has their  way, it will lose 40 percent of it's funding. I'd rather see it shut down for a week  than for good."
24139,josh,Mr. President.
24140,bartlet,Excuse me.
24141,josh,The Capitol is just a five or ten minute walk from here. Care to stretch your legs?
24142,bartlet,"I'm sorry folks, I've got a meeting on the Hill."
24143,bartlet,You bet!  Granville?
24144,bartlet,What do you say we walk the rest of the way?
24145,josh,Hello. President Bartlet is here to see Speaker Haffley.
24146,josh,They're finishing something up. 
24147,bartlet,Then we'll just have to wait.
24148,josh,No. This is great.
24149,josh,Mr. President.
24150,bartlet,Hmm?
24151,josh,Let's go. Right now.
24152,c.j.,Mrs. Bartlet.
24154,c.j.,"Yes, ma'am."
24156,c.j.,Ma'am?
24158,c.j.,"Yes, ma'am. Mrs. Bartlet, it's good to have you back."
24159,c.j., The Bartlets will also be serving their guests a Colorado beet  salad and California green beans.
24160,c.j.,"Yeah, Mark?"
24161,c.j.,I attribute it to the President's sincere desire to reach a settlement. Shirley?
24162,toby,Go ahead.
24163,toby,Yeah.
24164,toby,They got more volunteers than they expected.
24165,toby,It's a successful program. That's what happens when something succeeds.
24166,toby,"People should get combat pay, they go into inner cities to teach children, with no  parents, work in soup kitchens, try to get addicts off the streets."
24167,leo,Royce isn't coming.
24168,toby,Are you sure?
24170,toby,What are they offering?
24171,leo,I don't know.
24172,leo,"Excuse me, Mr. President. Hello, Abbey."
24174,leo,The Speaker is here.
24175,bartlet,Okay.
24177,bartlet,I won't.
24178,leo,You sure you want to do this one on one?
24179,bartlet,I'll be fine.
24180,leo,You can expect him to be very...
24181,bartlet, I'll be fine.
24182,bartlet,"Leo? These last months, thank you. Thank you for everything."
24183,leo,"  Mr. Speaker, please."
24184,bartlet,Mr. Speaker! 
24185,bartlet, Have a seat.
24186,bartlet,How are you?
24187,bartlet,"Yeah, it's been going around."
24188,bartlet,"Well, we should get started. Abbey's having the Prime Minister and his wife over for  dinner, and I promised to be on time."
24189,bartlet," We're not doing another CR, Mr. Speaker."
24190,bartlet, is the  President.
24191,bartlet," All 14 appropriations bills, exactly as we left them four days ago. It took us  what, ten months to work out our differences on those bills."
24192,bartlet,"I agree. I want you to cut agriculture subsidies, and you want me to cut Medicaid,  again. You know I'll veto any Medicaid cuts, and I know you won't give me any  agriculture cuts. So, here we are."
24193,bartlet," No. We were 100 billion apart, and I met you halfway, at 50 billion.  Then we were 50 billion apart, and I suspect if I'd gone down to 25, we'd be 12  billion apart."
24194,bartlet,This administration has created the greatest amount of wealth in history.
24195,bartlet,"Not everyone can pull themselves up by their bootstraps, Mr. Speaker. "
24196,bartlet, You're not going to demonize the millions of selfless teachers and public  servants who are...
24197,bartlet,"Well, I'm not going to negotiate with anyone who holds a gun to my head! We had a deal!  I don't care if my approval ratings drop into single digits. I am the President of the  United States and I will leave this government shut down until we reach an equitable  agreement! "
24199,toby,Could mean anything.
24200,josh,It's a good thing.
24201,josh,Hey.
24205,josh,You hear about the NBA rookie who pulled his first rebound the night Wilt Chamberlain  pulled 55?
24207,josh,Said it was the proudest day of his life. Together he and Wilt went for 34 points  and 56 rebounds.
24209,josh,You pulled 11 million.
24211,josh,"No, you're the rookie."
24212,toby,It is worth noting that Philadelphia lost that game.
24213,leo,Haffley just left.
24214,josh,What did we get? Another continuing resolution?
24215,bartlet,No.  A budget. 
24216,c.j.,Their cap gains tax cut?
24217,bartlet,No.
24218,toby,What about our college tuition tax credit?
24219,bartlet,"No, but it's a tax cut. Republicans are always in favor of tax cuts, so if we can find  a way to make it revenue-neutral next year, it stays."
24220,bartlet,"We'd already done our part, so the Speaker graciously agreed to do his."
24221,josh,Yee-ah!
24222,bartlet,"Okay, Abbey says I have about five minutes before dinner. What's next?"
24223,c.j.," Sleigh bells ringing and jing-jing-jingling, ding-ding-ding  ding..."
24224,toby,What are you doing?
24225,c.j.,I'm holding up my tree. Isn't it nice?
24226,toby,What are you doing to it?
24227,c.j.,I'm holding it up. The stand isn't...
24228,toby,They didn't have anything smaller?
24229,c.j.,Smaller than me is a shrub. I wanted a real tree this year.
24230,toby,Hmm. 
24231,toby,This is fine. I just cut some of the naked gloating.
24232,c.j.,"We restarted the government, Toby. There was a showdown at the OK Corral,  and we gunned down the Clantons. We're heroes."
24233,toby,And yet self-effacing.
24234,c.j.,Can we get a bigger stand?
24235,c.j.,"No comments for anything called the Crier, the Intelligencer or the  Breeze."
24236,c.j., That's against the law. It's what the  DEA does with their time.
24237,bartlet,"All three of our daughters in one place for Christmas. You've never seen  that, have you?"
24238,bartlet, She's never seen it.
24240,bartlet,What if she quits before then? She's flighty.
24242,bartlet,I'm grateful. But Debbie thinks one night isn't a visit so much as a pit  stop.
24243,bartlet,Thank you.
24245,bartlet,I'm not dwelling. I think it's fine. I think we should all spend  Christmas at Liz's in-laws.
24247,bartlet,Never again. I still have flashbacks.
24249,bartlet,"Good to see you, Jim."
24251,bartlet,You should get a few of the dinner with the family together. I'll be  there.
24253,bartlet,I will.
24255,bartlet,How hard could it possibly be?
24257,bartlet,I'm not asking her to stay a week. It's one meal.
24258,leo,DNC's a maybe. Uphoffs are a maybe.
24259,leo,"""Hostages?"" Did he just say ""hostage?"""
24260,leo, Get  Josh on this call now.
24261,bartlet,I don't want to sit next to Doug tonight. I don't want to hear about his  kayak.
24263,bartlet,"Tell Ellie if she's late, she has to sit next to Doug."
24264,bartlet,Lizzie.
24266,bartlet," How are you, kid?"
24268,bartlet,Doug.
24269,bartlet,Was there a stowaway in the car? A monster? 
24270,bartlet,I got him! I got him! Come with me.
24271,c.j.,"Leo, we have a..."
24272,leo,I saw it. Hostages.
24273,c.j.,No. The DEA.
24274,leo,What's their problem?
24275,c.j.,We have a hostage situation?
24276,bartlet,You and I have a very serious job to do tonight.
24277,leo,Mr. President.
24278,bartlet,"Oh, great!"
24279,leo, Twelve relief workers in Sudan got thrown in jail.  Congressman's on CNN calling them hostages.
24280,bartlet,You sure do.  You talk to State?
24281,c.j.,I just heard myself. I was... there's a problem at the DEA.
24282,bartlet,Hang on.
24283,bartlet,"Five minutes ago, we were having a quiet morning. I got to take a look.  I'll catch up with you in a few minutes. We've got all sorts of good  stuff planned."
24284,leo,"Sudanese authorities say some of them were trying to convert the locals  to Christianity, and it's Islamic law in Northern Sudan..."
24285,bartlet,So they threw the whole lot of them in jail.
24286,leo,Sudan desk got a call from Congressman Richter. Two are his  constituents.
24287,c.j.,"Sir, did you talk to the DEA yesterday?"
24288,bartlet,No. Did State tell you about this Richter thing?
24289,bartlet,"Well, this blew up good and fast, didn't it?"
24290,josh,State's treating it like any other foreign arrest. There'll be a  consular visit and a trial. Richter isn't satisfied with that.
24291,c.j.,Sudanese jail. You gotta hope someone back home's making noise.
24292,bartlet,Were they proselytizing?
24293,josh,"We don't know. Richter says no. He spoke to a junior officer at the  Sudan desk, thinks they're blowing it off so he's trying to bump it up  the ladder."
24294,c.j.,"""Hostage"" is a big word. Particularly at Christmas."
24295,bartlet,All right. Let's get him in here. What about the DEA?
24296,c.j.,The DEA's coming down on a doctor in Oregon for assisting on a suicide.  There's no federal jurisdiction. I don't know what they think they're  doing.
24297,bartlet,What do they say?
24298,c.j.,They're calling it a violation of the Controlled Substances Act. The  narcotic he used is federally controlled.
24299,toby,So's a handgun.
24300,josh,Yeah.
24301,toby,Doesn't turn a shooting into a federal case.
24302,josh,He makes a point.
24303,bartlet,We're sure this wasn't an accident? Pay management gone awry?
24304,c.j.,The doctor's not hiding his intentions. The state of Oregon says it's  legal. He was assisting a terminal patient to hasten the end of her  suffering.
24305,bartlet,It's a living.
24306,c.j.,"Well, yes, in Oregon, it is."
24307,bartlet,When's your next briefing?
24308,c.j.,An hour. I was going to go...
24309,toby,I don't think we comment. It's DOJ's mess. We don't want it.
24310,c.j.,We don't want a lot of things.
24311,toby,"For four years it's been, ""The President does not personally support  physician assisted suicide but believes it's not a federal issue and  should be resolved by the voters."""
24312,bartlet,State by state. And not by the Drug Enforcement Administration.
24313,toby,We don't jump into the middle of a bar fight and declare our intention  not to act. Let the Attorney General handle it.
24314,leo,I'll sit down with the A.G.
24315,bartlet,Thanks everybody.
24316,leo,"Thank you, sir."
24317,bartlet,"Debbie, where are they?"
24319,josh,Talk to Debbie. We need a sit-down for Congressman Donald Richter today.  And get him on the phone.
24321,c.j.,Liz's Doug?
24322,josh,How come he's not with his in-laws?
24324,josh,Why's a five-year-old want to meet the Three Tenors?
24326,c.j.,Doug's your friend.
24327,josh,He's a perfectly nice guy.
24328,c.j.,Speak slowly. You don't want to lose him.
24329,josh,Check it out! They're decking the halls.
24331,josh,Douglas!
24332,josh,It's good to see you.
24333,josh,That's government property. I'm gonna have to call the Feds.
24334,josh,Come on in.
24335,josh,You guys here for a couple days?
24336,josh,No Annie?
24337,josh,She... on purpose?
24338,josh,Yeah. I mean-- yeah. What's...?
24339,josh,Ken Campbell.
24340,josh,That's great. I mean not the-- But we'll have a good shot at the seat.
24341,josh,To what?
24342,leo,Mm-hmm.
24343,leo,Alan. 
24344,leo,How come I don't hear your daughters performing at the Kennedy Center  till two days after?
24345,leo,This cowboy over at the DEA. You fire him yet?
24346,leo,Sooner is better.
24347,leo,The Controlled Substances Act is about drug trafficking. It was never  intended to supplant the states as regulators of medical practice.
24348,leo,"The voters of Oregon have declared the termination of life, pain and  suffering to be a legitimate medical purpose, and frankly, whether they  were right or wrong is none of the DEA's business. Assisted suicide  should be..."
24349,leo,Okay. We're done.
24350,leo,You'll be hearing from the President.
24351,leo,"You're not a legislative body, Alan. There's only so many times you can  pool this before the President..."
24352,leo,"I don't want to have this fight.  But if we do,  I win."
24353,toby,Fire him.
24354,c.j.,The Attorney General?
24355,toby,Fire him. We hired him.
24356,leo,"We fire him over assisted suicide, it's 16 verses of ""Grandma Got Run  Over By The Bartlets"" now till Easter."
24357,c.j.,"""No comment"" is not gonna play."
24358,toby,How about we let the VP be the front man?
24359,c.j.,Seriously?
24360,toby,We're staring a State of the Union in the face. This is what hijacks the  agenda for weeks at a time.  This is what we talked about.
24361,c.j.,"What, do you need me to leave the room?"
24362,leo,Toby's taking first chair on the State of the Union. Not just writing  it.
24363,c.j.,The agenda. That's great.
24364,toby,"And if I'm doing it, I'm doing it. This is not on the agenda."
24365,leo,Talk to Will.
24366,toby,Thank you.
24367,c.j.,Lizzie B.
24368,c.j.,You didn't.
24369,c.j.,Thanks for the heads up.
24370,c.j.,You going?
24371,c.j.,He from UNESCO?
24372,c.j.,No. Can you maybe handle that?
24373,c.j.,I've got a meeting. Could you tell her?
24374,c.j.,Not really.
24375,bartlet,"Congressman, you start saying ""hostages,"" things get a little out of  hand."
24376,bartlet,"Sit. Hiya, Ted."
24377,bartlet, Please.
24378,bartlet,"They're not gonna do that. Ted spoke with the families, let them know  we're waiting on a report from the consular officer. You gotta let it go  through channels."
24379,bartlet,We don't arbitrate. We can't. Not in 193 countries with as many legal  systems.
24380,c.j.,"We're expecting about 6,000 people. We're gonna switch on the lights,  then there will be performances by the United States Marine band and the  Louisiana Bayou Gospel Choir. And there's gonna be a troop of dancing  snowmen. Men, really, dressed as snowmen. Not as scary as it sounds.  Though probably deeply humiliating for the men. "
24381,c.j.,No? Snowmen?  Your mom's gonna be right back. And your grandpa  will be rolling in here any second now.
24382,c.j.,So what did you think of the Three Tenors?
24383,bartlet,Is Dr. McNally in her office?
24384,bartlet,Come again?
24385,bartlet,Flipping a switch?
24386,bartlet,He'll be fine. Ellie can show him. She did it one year in New Hampshire.  Ellie's not here yet?
24387,bartlet,All right. Push the rehearsal. I need to stop at Nancy McNally's. Is  Ellie even coming?
24388,bartlet,One would never know that the leaders of powerful nations respond to my  call on a moment's notice.
24389,toby,Russell's speaking to the American Nursing Association this week?
24391,toby,We'd like him to do a speech insert.
24393,toby,It's gonna come up in Q&A anyway. Might as well nip it in the bud.
24395,toby,We're trying to make sure you can move to Oregon and kill yourself.
24397,toby,We need to place some distance between the President and...
24399,toby,"The AG's back-dooring this on a technicality. We're gonna wait till the  courts knock it down, which they will. Meanwhile, he's usurping the  policy prerogative of the President. We need somebody to remind the  public it wasn't our decision."
24401,toby,We didn't ask you to groom Russell for a Presidential run. He asked you.
24403,toby,He was chosen by the Republicans!
24405,toby,I'm sorry. I'm sure you're gonna pull a great Eliza Doolittle here.
24407,toby,"Meanwhile, if the Vice President would be so kind, in between campaign  stops, could he do the President this favor?"
24410,josh,That's three weeks away.
24412,josh,There's plenty of time.
24414,josh,You are.
24416,josh,I like the polar fleece stuff.
24418,josh,You are.
24419,josh,Hey.
24421,josh,Zoey. Wow! You look fantastic.
24423,josh,"Wow, she looks great."
24424,josh,Leo.
24425,leo,Yeah.
24426,josh,You got a second?
24427,leo,Yeah.
24428,josh,"Am I still on congressional recruitment, or is Angela gonna take that?"
24429,leo,"How about you two sit like grown-ups, and you figure it out for  yourselves?"
24430,josh,"I don't care. It's just starting, so..."
24431,leo,You getting calls already?
24432,josh,Yeah. A nice young guy from New Hampshire wants to run for Campbell's  seat. Married to the boss's daughter.
24433,bartlet,"From New Hampshire? The U.S. Congress, not the state legislature? "
24434,josh,No.
24435,bartlet,And he wants an endorsement?
24436,josh,I spoke to the county chair and the D triple C. They have some doubts.
24437,leo,Did you know about this thing with Lanthorp Biotech?
24438,bartlet,They were in a nose dive. I know he tried to pull them out.
24439,josh,He didn't.
24440,leo,DNC wants to run Mitch Clark. He's been on the state legislature  three terms. He's got ideas. He's a deal-maker. This has been a  Republican seat a couple of terms. The party doesn't want to risk it  with anybody untried.
24441,josh,"Even with our endorsement, he may not make it to the primary."
24442,leo,Then everybody looks like an idiot.
24443,bartlet,I'll talk to him.
24444,josh,"I can talk to him, sir."
24445,bartlet,"No, I'll do it."
24446,leo,"Mr. President, he went to Josh, asked his opinion. You got to respect  that. Let Josh take care of it."
24448,toby,I asked you what? Ten minutes ago?
24450,toby,"You found him, brought it up, carefully considered, then decided I can  go stuff it?"
24452,toby,Did you even take it to him? Or just walk around the block and come  back with your 'no'?
24454,toby, I should've sent a card.
24456,toby,"I know who you are. You're the guy we pulled out of Botox Babylon out  there, brought to work for the President."
24458,toby,"No, you certainly don't."
24459,toby,The President will take it to the Vice President.
24461,c.j.,"Did you see the clips Carol dropped off? The Jackson Clarion-Ledger  says, ""Attorney General Cracks Down On Doc Peddling Death."""
24462,toby,Catchy.
24463,c.j.,"Nobody but the locals in Oregon had picked it up yet, except the Jackson  Clarion-Ledger."
24464,toby,"Jackson, Mississippi?"
24465,c.j.,"Home of the steamboat, the mud pie, and Attorney General Alan Fisk. He's  talked about running for governor."
24466,toby,The AG?
24467,c.j., Is the Vice President going to...?
24468,toby,I'm working on it.
24469,c.j.,'Cause I've been thinking maybe it's time we get back into this.
24470,toby,We thought it through the first time.
24471,c.j.,Five years ago.
24472,toby,And Oregon hasn't worked out all the kinks.
24473,c.j.,The number of suicides among the terminally ill has gone down since they  passed it.
24474,toby,A policy of non-intervention...
24475,c.j.,...is a little lame when there's a 14th amendment violation in the  offing.
24476,toby,"We have no Constitutional right to die. Refuse treatment, yeah, but..."
24477,c.j.,"The framers never considered the notion of degenerative death, an event  which is entirely the creation of modern medicine. We have a right not  to reach the end of life in unendurable suffering and agony."
24478,toby,We're not stopping anybody from squirreling away 50 Seconal in a  nightstand and washing it down with a bottle of vodka.
24479,c.j.,"In order to down the 50 Seconal, you have to have control of both the  muscles in the hand and the muscles of the esophagus. This is an  opportunity, and we're dodging it."
24480,toby,"C.J., how's your dad?"
24481,c.j.,He's in the hospital. I don't know. I don't know... if he knows the  difference.
24482,josh,He's hitting already?
24483,josh,"That's great. So, New Hampshire, First District."
24484,josh,You know a guy named Mitchell Clark?
24485,josh,The DNC seems to think he's got a chance for Campbell's seat.
24486,josh,"No question. We have a shot, but the party, they're... reticent..."
24487,josh,That could be part of it.
24488,josh,What about state legislature? It's the place to learn. The President  started there...
24489,josh,I don't know.
24490,josh,Yeah.
24491,toby,Hi. You back to stay?
24492,toby,"You look, uh... great."
24493,toby,I was hoping you could speak to the Vice President. Ask him to do some  talking for us on the right-to-die situation.
24494,bartlet,Yeah. He said Will brought it up.
24495,toby,You already discussed it?
24496,bartlet,"That's not gonna work. Leo's hoping the Attorney General will back down.  If not, C.J. puts it in the Christmas Eve briefing, restates our  position, it's gone by Boxing Day."
24497,toby,"We just had a huge victory, and we're looking at a month of Christmas  carols, and the official ornament from the State of South Dakota. The  press is itching for a story with blood in it..."
24498,bartlet,The court will stop him. There's no way...
24499,toby,One in five patients requesting aid in dying has MS. One in five. Do you  know what the questions sound like?
24500,bartlet,I've got a pretty good idea.
24501,toby,"""How long does the President think he has before his MS will become  debilitating?"" ""Do the doctors anticipate a speedy decline?"" ""Does he  have a plan?"" ""Does the First Lady have four glass vials and a syringe  in a lock box in the night stand?"""
24502,bartlet, She may chicken out. Maybe I'll call you.
24503,toby,"That's the conversation, sir. It won't be Controlled Substances Act, or  federal overreaching, or anything else. I don't think we're ready to  have that conversation with the American public."
24504,leo,Hey. Did you get a chance to talk...?
24505,josh,Doug? Yeah.
24506,leo,Did he take it okay?
24507,josh,"He did, you know. He really did."
24508,leo,Good.
24509,leo,You want to carry my books or something?
24510,josh,I'm not sure he got it.
24511,leo,Got what?
24512,josh,The rejection.
24513,leo,"If he didn't take it personal, all the better."
24514,josh,I think he thinks he's still running.
24515,leo,You didn't tell him?!
24516,josh,He took it more like a cautionary tale than an actual...
24517,leo,"Oh, for the love of God."
24518,josh,"He's resilient, which isn't a very bad thing in a candidate."
24519,leo,"He's gonna show up at dinner, popping champagne corks, and the  President's gonna be stuck delivering the news in front of the guy's  wife and his mother-in-law. You have to go back and tell him no."
24520,josh,Yeah.
24521,leo,In no uncertain terms.
24522,josh,I'm sorry.
24523,leo,Draw a picture if you need it. A ballot in a circle with a line through  it.
24524,c.j.,Liz and Gus are running a little behind schedule. Can we push this to  four?
24525,leo,Everything okay?
24526,bartlet,I'm waiting for my daughter and her son to arrive so we can practice the  ceremonial flipping of a switch.
24527,leo,Right.
24528,bartlet,"He had a Fisher-Price gizmo hooked to the side of this crib with more  cranks and levers than a DC-10, but we're gonna practice with the  switch."
24529,leo,C.J. says the assisted suicide story's showing up in some Mississippi  papers.
24530,bartlet,You think Fisk is feeding it to them? I want him in here first thing  tomorrow.
24531,leo," Consular report from Sudan. Holly Gilweit and  Katherine Melo, ages 20 and 23 respectively, had a grand total of 18  Bibles and a video on the lives of the Apostles."
24532,bartlet, The NGO know about this?
24533,leo,They never identified themselves as evangelists. Never mentioned  religion.
24534,bartlet,So they're undercover agents?
24535,leo,"Spies for Christ, yeah."
24536,bartlet,"18 Bibles. They couldn't have just talked about loving, kindness and  good will towards men? I just had Berryhill call the prime minister of  Sudan and issue a stern reprimand for behavior that I likened to street  gangs and petty thieves. We need to issue an apology."
24537,leo,We can't. Ten other relief workers who weren't distributing anything  other than wheat and sorghum are in jail. We've got to stick with our  denial.
24538,bartlet,But they know what's going on.
24539,leo,And we know. That's where the money comes in. Nancy's waiting  downstairs.
24540,bartlet,Debbie?  20 and 23?
24541,leo,Girls.
24542,bartlet,"Toby asked me today if I have a plan for my death. Liz has never asked.  Zoey. I understand Ellie asked her mother once, but I'm not supposed to  know about it. I get Toby."
24543,bartlet,Are we expecting Liz and Gus?
24544,bartlet,"Nancy McNally is waiting, and she's already had her bath."
24545,bartlet, Josh talk to Doug yet?
24546,leo,They spoke. He didn't seem to follow. Josh is gonna try again.
24547,bartlet,He didn't follow? 
24548,leo,Josh wasn't clear.
24549,bartlet,What's not to follow?
24550,leo,"It's hard to say. Thank you, Mr. President."
24551,bartlet,3.2 billion men in the world. She picks him.
24552,bartlet,"When he was 19, sure. She dumped a Rhodes scholar for this guy. Zoey  left Charlie for the Frog. Ellie and the guitar player with the purple  van. My children choose morons. Every one."
24553,bartlet,"You know, 15 years ago, we took a trip to Egypt, all five of us, saw the  pyramids and Luxor, then headed up into the Sinai. We had a guide, a  Bedouin man, who called me ""Abu el Banat."" Whenever we'd meet another  Bedouin, he'd introduce me as ""Abu el Banat."" The Bedouin would laugh  and laugh and then offer me a cup of tea. And I'd go and pay them for  the tea, and they wouldn't let me. ""Abu el Banat"" means ""father of  daughters."" They thought the tea was the least they could do."
24554,bartlet,Thanks.
24555,c.j.,"Does he know we've heard ""The Twelve Days of Christmas"" twice?"
24556,bartlet,What did Liz say?
24557,bartlet,I should go up there.
24558,c.j.,"7,000 people standing in the cold, sir, you have to go turn on the  lights."
24559,bartlet,Any movement?
24560,bartlet,Gus or Doug?
24561,bartlet," Len, this gonna be okay?"
24562,bartlet, It's cold out there. You got a coat?
24563,bartlet,Here we go.
24564,c.j., She's good.
24568,josh,Yeah. How'd it go with the tree?
24569,josh,"Okay, um... the conversation we had earlier. I think I wasn't clear."
24570,josh,We're asking you not to run.
24571,josh,The DNC. The White House.
24572,josh,"If you want to go forward on your own, the White House can't endorse  you."
24573,josh,The New Hampshire House is a great place to get some experience. Build  a network...
24574,josh,Hal Collins is... You met with Hal?
24575,josh,That's...
24576,josh,Any time.
24577,bartlet,He shouldn't be upset. He'll light the tree next year. 
24579,bartlet,He's not eating?
24580,bartlet,Why didn't we eat earlier?
24582,bartlet,Isn't there some kind of person...?
24583,bartlet,I thought that's exactly what a nanny was.
24585,bartlet,"Would you like to call him up and tell him we're waiting, and he can  leave the child in the confident care of the chinless Swede?"
24587,bartlet,Apparently not.
24591,bartlet,We have yet to determine if medical science can spare Ellie Bartlet for  an evening.
24595,leo,"Good evening, everybody. I apologize. They said they hadn't started  serving."
24597,bartlet,Did you want to sit? We have room.
24598,leo,"Thank you, no. We, um..."
24599,bartlet,Excuse me.
24600,leo,"Two more physicians' licenses were just suspended. The AG's downstairs.  I asked him to come in tomorrow, but he's getting on a plane."
24601,bartlet,When's his flight?
24602,leo,Two hours.
24603,bartlet, Five minutes. Ellie's still not here. I'll beat her  back.
24606,bartlet,Two more doctors? You couldn't wait a year to start campaigning?
24607,bartlet,You don't run for governor from my Cabinet.
24608,bartlet,"""The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution are  reserved to the states respectively."""
24609,bartlet,"Yes. When is it allowing the state to decide, not families? We'll just  start knocking off the weak and the indigent along with the sick and  dying. When does my administration completely deteriorate into the Third  Reich?"
24610,bartlet,"The federal government has no place here. The question is a moral one,  an individual one. Grappling with the nature of life and the purview of  God, in which the federal government has no... Forget it. Do what you  want. The courts are gonna nail you. You're counting on my silence, and  you've just lost it. "
24611,bartlet,"Yeah, I didn't want to get on T.V. with Oprah and talk about who's gonna  cut my meat when the coordination goes, but c'est la vie. The lid's off.  You pull this crap one more time, you're fired. Tell Janet Merry  Christmas."
24612,bartlet,There's a guy named Mitch Clark. DNC's been...
24613,bartlet,"The district's splitting right, much more than in my day."
24614,bartlet,Elizabeth...
24615,bartlet,"He went to Josh. He didn't come to me. If he wanted my advice, or if you  did, for that matter...  Doug didn't call Hal Collins. You did.  You recruited the finance committee."
24616,bartlet,"""The Speaker can convince most people of most things and himself of  almost anything."" Doug came up with that?"
24617,bartlet,He's a great guy and a fantastic father. You're the politician. Why the  hell don't you run?
24618,bartlet,You can handle it.
24619,bartlet,Your mother did.
24620,bartlet,"There's no question we missed things. We all made sacrifices, but  Elizabeth, when Annie and Gus watch you walk onto the floor of the U.S.  House of Representatives..."
24621,bartlet,Then why would you let Doug?
24623,josh,Spontaneously?
24625,josh,Who's that for? 
24626,josh,You picked your own gift?
24628,josh,I got your gift.
24630,josh,I saw it Thanksgiving. I got it.
24632,josh,I'm not telling you.
24634,josh,Really? It's a gift certificate. Tower Records. 'Cause you're a fan of  the music. You get to go on a spree.
24636,josh, So that's why I need to sit with Approps and find some foreign  aid money we can reprogram.
24638,josh,Bribing a dictator to get illegal missionaries out of Sudan.
24640,josh,Reassigning funds from extant authorizations based on new priorities in  East Africa.
24642,josh,"Donna, it's not a gift certificate."
24644,josh,I'm not telling you.
24646,josh,Socks.
24648,josh,I'm not telling you. Live with the pain.
24650,bartlet,I'm waiting. There's a fruit bowl. Turns out the fruit's real.
24652,bartlet,Ellie's here? That's nice. She enjoying her stay?
24654,bartlet,I'm not sure we're gonna see her for dinner. It's okay. I got a picture  in my wallet of the three girls together from Acadia in '96.
24656,bartlet,It's bigger than Doug.
24658,bartlet,That and the cauliflower incident.
24660,bartlet,There's still time. Shame about Gus and the tree.
24662,bartlet,I did. He would have had fun.
24664,bartlet,"Oh, yeah. Last Christmas, Ellie wasn't around. The year before was  Tennessee and the calls to Belarus. I can't remember when it was just  the five of us and weather and everybody in their slippers."
24666,bartlet,We did.
24668,bartlet,"I'm putting together a panel on assisted suicide. If you got any names,  medical ethicists."
24670,bartlet, Uh-uh... No syringe in the nightstand. It'll get  ugly and that's that... You gonna be there?
24672,bartlet,Abbey.
24674,c.j.,"He's not a fan of turkey. I was told he didn't eat any of it... Yes.  Talmidge Cregg. The other night nurse... Right. We spoke the day after  Thanksgiving... It's fine. I just thought maybe I could send a ham...  No, I'm not asking the kitchen to do it. I'm saying It's three weeks  away. They vacuum pack it. If I could just send it to you, and you could  see that they give it to him instead of... No, this is... I'm... This is  C.J. I'm-I'm his daughter."
24675,bartlet,Ready?
24676,bartlet,Okay.
24677,josh,Donna!
24679,josh,I'm going home.
24681,josh,"Yeah, I know."
24683,josh,What students?
24685,josh,What are you talking about?
24687,josh, When did... When did this get on the schedule?
24689,josh,"No, it hasn't, it just... There isn't anybody else who can do this?"
24691,josh,I have to work.
24693,josh,"No, I can't work in the office! "
24694,josh,"We've crashed five times in the last three weeks. When I'm not being evacuated  from the building, I'm not being allowed to leave the building and now, the one...  God, Donna, I wanna go home."
24696,josh," All right, I'll give them a few minutes, but then I gotta go, ok?"
24698,josh, When am I supposed to do this?
24700,josh,Where are they?
24702,josh,Good evening! Good to see you... you're the group from Presidential... something?
24704,josh,Classroom?
24705,josh,Josh Lyman.
24706,josh,"So, how'd you all get here?"
24707,josh,I meant...
24708,josh,"All right, I'm Josh Lyman, I'm the Deputy White House Chief of Staff, I joined the  Bartlet campaign shortly before the Iowa Caucus, then served as the campaign's  political director. Before that, I worked with then Senator John Hoynes for a while..."
24710,josh, Yeah? 
24711,josh," All right, listen, something's about to happen. Don't let it frighten you,  they need to seal the building."
24712,josh,"Yeah, I guess they are.  Something's happened."
24714,josh,What's going on?
24716,josh,"Would you call Leo's office and find out what's going on, and, more important,  how long it's going to be going on for?"
24718,josh,"Yeah, I'll definitely give that a try. "
24719,josh,"Okay, well, uh, this is called a ""crash."" It means there's been some kind of  security breach and no one's allowed in or out of the building. "
24720,josh,Would you call Leo's office? 
24721,josh,"So, I guess we should use this time. Uh, this is the White House, the home of the  President and the Executive Branch, the most powerful of the three branches of  the federal government. "
24722,josh,Yeah.
24723,josh,What's your name?
24724,josh,"I'll call you Fred. A little knowledge can be a dangerous thing. I don't know how long  we're all going to be here, but you just made my list. "
24725,josh,"Yes, I suppose, technically, constitutionally the Legislative Branch is the most  powerful, but we get a motorcade, so back off. All right, you already know about the  branches of government, I assume you know how a bill becomes a law. What do you want  to talk about? "
24726,josh,"Guys, seriously, it's nothing to worry about. We've been having these crashes once a week.  Let's go. Somebody ask me something."
24727,josh,"Well... it's not everybody, and they're trying to kill you, too."
24728,josh,"No, both of us the same. Let's go, it doesn't have to be about politics. You're off  to college. I'm the guy who knows what you need to know. Sophomore year, my roommates  and I got a fish registered for 18 credits, and she made Dean's List. My roommates and  I made a Dean's List of a different sort, but that doesn't matter."
24729,josh,"No. I mean, we're bystanders, basically, and we work around a lot of people who  routinely put themselves in harm's way-the Secret Service and the military.  You know, the protection detail? They practice a thousand different scenarios  for a gun: who tackles the president, who opens the car, who's covering the  perimeter, and there's one guy whose job it is to stand in front of the bullet.  Not get the shooter-stand in front of the bullet. I've seen him do it."
24730,josh,"No.  Well... my, uh... my mother wants me to.  My family members have a habit of, uh, dying before you're supposed too. So it's  just me and my mom now and... You guys know I guess, that I got accidentally shot  a little bit or something at Rosslyn. So, she'd like to see me in the private sector.  But I tell her my government salary may not be a lot, but I still make more than  the guy whose job it is to stand in front of the bullet, so how do I tell him I'm  quitting? So she made me this box that I'm supposed to keep in the trunk of my car,  and it's got a super-powered flashlight, five gallons of water, and a transistor  radio, and some first aid. But she keeps thinking of things to add to it. She'll  call and say, uh, ""I found that cap that Dad got Joe Pepitone to sign for you on  your birthday. You wore it to school every day in the seventh grade. You want me  to send it to you so you can put it in the box?"" "
24731,josh,"So... I'll say ""Yeah, Ma, let's put it in the box."" "
24732,josh,"So anyway, I... I don't know against who, and I don't know what it's going to look like,  but one of these days we're gonna have a big win, and for a lot of us who've seen what  we've seen, we're not leaving till we do. I'm gonna be here six presidents from now,  in my office, Wile E. Coyote and a map."
24733,josh,It's not everybody.
24734,josh,It's not Arabs. It's not Islamics.  They're juniors and seniors? 
24736,josh,"You're juniors and seniors.   In honor of the SAT's you're about to take, answer the following question. "
24737,josh,"Thanks. Islamic extremist is to Islamic as ""blank"" is to Christianity. "
24738,josh,"Islamic... extremist... is to... Islamic... as... ""blank"" is... to Christianity."
24739,josh,No.
24740,josh,"No. Guys, the Christian right may not be your cup of tea, but they're not blowing  stuff up. ""Islamic extremist is to Islamic as ""blank is to Christianity."" "
24741,josh,"That's what we're talking about. It's the Klan, gone medieval and global. It couldn't  have less to do with Islamic men and women of faith of whom there are millions upon  millions. Muslims defend this country in the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps,  National guard, police and fire departments. So, let's ask the question again."
24742,josh,That's a reasonable question if ever I heard one. Why are we targets of war? 
24743,josh,That's it?
24744,josh,No other reasons? 
24745,josh,"I'll tell you, right or wrong-and I think they're wrong-it's probably a good idea to  acknowledge that they do have specific complaints. I-I hear them every day-the people  we support, troops in Saudi Arabia, sanctions against Iraq, support for Egypt.  It's not just that they don't like Irving Berlin."
24747,josh,"No, it's not. "
24749,josh,You just called me ridiculous twice in one sentence. 
24751,josh,And you just made my list.
24753,josh,"It's a serious list. But she does have a point, albeit college girlish."
24755,josh,"Hardly a record for me. What's Islamic extremism? It's strict adherence to a particular  interpretation of 7th century Islamic law as practiced by the prophet Mohammed, and  when I say ""strict adherence,"" I'm not kidding around. Men are forced to pray, wear  their beards a certain length. Among my favorites is there's only one acceptable cheer  at a soccer match: Allah-uh-Akbar-God is great. If your guys are getting creamed,  then you're on your own. Things are a lot less comic for women, who aren't allowed  to attend school or have jobs. They're not allowed to be unaccompanied, and oftentimes  get publicly stoned to death for crimes like not wearing a veil. I don't have to tell  you they don't need to shout at a soccer match because they're never going to go to one.  So what bothers them about us? Well, the variety of cheers alone coming from the cheap  seats at Giants stadium when they're playing the Cowboys is enough for a jihad, to say  nothing of street corners lined church next to synagogue, next to mosque, newspapers  that can print anything they want, women who can do anything they want including taking  a rocket ship to outer space, vote, and play soccer. This is a plural society. That  means we accept more than one idea. It offends them. So yes, she does have a point,  but that certainly doesn't mean you should listen to her."
24756,josh,What?
24757,josh,"Well, I think for help with that question we're going to need some people smarter than I am."
24759,josh,"Thing is... that's pretty tough to find. But I'm going to go upstairs and see if I can  get some of my friends to come down and join us. Listen, I-I don't know what's going on  and I don't know how long we're going to be here. Are you guys hungry?"
24760,josh,"Freddy, why don't you grab a couple of people, go to the back of the kitchen, get apples  and peanut butter? Guys, I've gotten entire pieces of legislation through Congress on  apples and peanut butter. I'll be back in a little bit."
24761,leo,Who's the third?
24762,leo,"It was only a matter of time, huh?"
24763,leo,You know who I am?
24764,toby,Kill them all. Yeah.
24765,toby,"No, no. I mean everyone. You're all bothering me. I want to be left alone. Clearly, the only  way that's gonna happen is to be alone. So I'm sorry, but I'm gonna have to let you all go.   Except the Yankees and the Knicks... and the Yankees and the Knicks are gonna need  someone to play, so keep the Red Sox and the Lakers... and the Laker girls, and The Palm,  and we'll need to keep the people who work at The Palm. That's it though. The Yankees, the  Red Sox, the Knicks, the Lakers, the Laker girls, and anyone who works at The Palm. Sports,  Laker girls, and a well-prepared steak. That's all I need... Sometimes, I like to mix it up  with Italian... and Chinese. All right, you can all stay, but don't bug me. You're on  probation. Don't forget. I was this close to banishing you."
24766,josh,"This is Toby Ziegler, and actually, he's in charge of crafting our message to the public."
24767,toby,"And today, that message is?"
24768,toby,That's right.
24769,toby,"My choice, sister. And by the way, there's nothing wrong with a religion whose laws say a  man's got to wear a beard or cover his head or wear a collar. It's when violation of these  laws become a crime against the State and not your parents that we're talking about lack of  choice.  ""Islamic Extremists is to Islamic as KKK is to  Christianity."" That's... that's about right. That's a good religious analogy. What's the  political analogy? What's an analogy using governments?"
24770,toby,The Taliban is not the recognized government of Afghanistan. The Taliban took over the  recognized government of Afghanistan. And there's your political analogy.
24771,toby,"When you think of Afghanistan, think of Poland. When you think of the Taliban, think of the  Nazis. When you think of the citizens of Afghanistan, think of the Jews in concentration camps.  A friend of my dad's was at one of the camps. He used to come over to the house, and he and  my dad used to shoot some pinochle. He said he once saw a guy at the camp kneeling and praying.  He said, ""What are you doing?"" The guy said he was thanking God. And my dad's friend said,  ""What could you possibly be thanking God for?"" He said, ""I'm thanking God for not making me  like them."" Bad people can't be recognized on sight. There's no point in trying."
24772,josh,"Actually, we already covered that."
24773,toby,"It's worth covering twice, don't you agree?"
24774,josh,I do.
24775,toby,Yeah.
24776,toby," Yeah, I've changed my mind again. Kill them all."
24777,josh,Laker girls?
24778,toby,"No, all right."
24779,toby, What was the first act of terrorism?
24780,josh,"I could answer, but I think he's asking you, man."
24781,toby," secret followers of Al-hassan Ibn-al-Sabbah,  who were taught to believe in nothing and dare all, carried out these very swift and very  treacherous murders of fellow Muslims, and they did it in the state of religious ecstasy."
24782,sam,"Ah, temptation. I have named thee, and thy name is woman."
24783,josh,"This is Sam Seaborn, Deputy Communications Director. Now, don't be frightened when I tell you  that in this room, Sam is the knowledgeable terrorism expert. The good news is in this  government, we have some extremely knowledgeable terrorism experts."
24784,sam,"I heard I was needed, I came."
24785,toby,"We were talking about Al-, am I pronouncing this right? Al-Hassan Ibn-al-Sabbah?"
24786,sam,"Yeah, from the eleventh century."
24787,toby,Yeah.
24788,sam,"By the way, the Arabic name for their secret order has survived until today. Can anybody guess  what it was? Their Arabic name.  You know."
24789,sam,Assassins. That's right.
24790,josh,"Yeah, we don't call on him."
24791,toby, What's going on?
24792,sam,There's supposed to be a meeting at Treasury.
24793,toby,"I had a 6:00 on the Hill, now I'm stuck here, you know, talking with well-dressed children  who can't vote."
24794,sam,I dabble.
24795,sam,It's 100% failure rate.
24796,sam,"Not only do terrorists always fail at what they're after, they pretty much always succeed in  strengthening whatever it is they're against."
24797,sam,"The Brits are still there. The Protestants are still there. Basque extremists have been staging  terrorist attacks in Spain for decades with no result. Left Wing Red Brigades from the 60s and  70s, from the Bader-Meinhoff gang in Germany to the Weatherman in the U.S. have tried to take  over capitalism. You tell me. How's capitalism doing?"
24798,sam,What about it?
24799,sam,"Yeah, it did. Who else did it work for?"
24800,sam,That's right.
24801,sam,"Nobody got hurt at the Boston Tea Party. The only people that got hurs was some fancy boys  who didn't have anything to wash down their crumpets with. We jumped out from behind bushes,  while the British came down the road in their bright red jackets, but never has a war been  so courteously declared.

24810,leo,What are you doing working for a White House staffer secretary?
24811,leo,We don't do a lot of math around here.
24812,leo,"You're aware that the intelligence agencies routinely recruit top mathematicians, oftentimes  out of M.I.T. and train them to be cryptographers."
24813,leo,"And those cryptographers are the ones who, on a daily basis, code and decode messages sent  between the White House, the State Department and the Pentagon."

24818,sam,You just don't do it.
24819,josh,C.J. has a bizarre affection for the intelligence community that we just don't...

24824,c.j.,"We need spies; human spies. Spy satellites are great if you're trying to detect  whether or not Kruschev's put missiles in Cuba. But if you want to overhear a  conversation over Turkish coffee in Khyber Pass, you need a spy. You guys want to  great a great job after college and serve your country? Study Arabic, Chinese and Farsi."
24825,toby,"Maybe this'd be a good time for a chorus of ""Our Maligned Little Brother, Civil Liberties."""
24826,c.j.,"Liberties, schmiberties."
24827,toby,"C.J. Cregg, ladies and gentlemen."
24828,c.j.,You know the way to do this without tapping some phones?
24829,toby,What about illegal searches? What about profiling? Do you know what Benjamin Franklin said?
24830,c.j.,"He said, ""Hey, look, I've invented the stove."""
24831,c.j.,What's your name?
24832,josh, I'm on it.
24833,c.j.,"Well, I don't think we're talking a little temporary safety and it's not like we need to  search high and low for clear and present danger."
24834,toby,"Well, what would you say the point of fighting terrorism is?"
24835,c.j.,"It's to insure freedom, Pokey. I don't need the brochure."
24836,toby,"I think you do cause during times of great crisis and threat, America has used Draconian  measures before and I think maybe you've forgotten just how affective they've been.  Can you name some?"
24837,toby, I want her to name them.
24838,c.j., The blacklist.
24839,toby,Thank you.
24840,c.j.,"Look, I talk civil liberties as seriously as anybody, okay? I've been to the dinners  and we haven't even talked about free speech yet and somebody getting lynched by the  patriotism police for voicing a minority opinion. That said, Tobus, we're going to  have to do some stuff. We're going to have to tap some phones and we're going to have  to partner with some people who are the lesser of evils. I'm sorry but terrorists don't  have armies and navies. They don't have capitals. Some of these guys we're going to have  to walk up to them and shoot them. Yeah, we can root terrorist nests but some of these  guys aren't going to be taken by the 105thn armored tank division. Some of these guys  are going to be taken by a busboy with a silencer. So it's time to give the intelligence  agencies the money and the manpower they need. We don't hear about their successes.  Guess what? The Soviets never crossed the Elbe. The North Koreans stayed behind the  38th parallel. During the Millennium? Not one incident. Do you think that's because  the terrorists decided that'd be a good day to take off? Not much action that day?  End of song."
24841,leo,What were you protesting.
24842,leo,What exactly is your concern with our troops in Saudi Arabia?
24843,leo,I'd like it fine if you were there to protect the Vatican.
24844,leo,We sent our troops down there to make sure our friends didn't cross the Kuwaiti border  and seize Saudi territory.
24845,leo,"Yes, we have oil interests in the gulf. So does the rest of the world."
24846,leo,Maybe we can teach them.
24847,leo,I can't imagine why.
24848,leo,"No, I'm trying to figure out why anytime there's any terrorist activity, people always  assume its Arabs. I'm racking my brain."
24849,leo,"Well, that's the price you pay."
24850,leo,(to the agent) Continue the questions.
24851,c.j.,There's nothing more American than coalition-building. The first thing John Wayne  always did was put together a posse.
24852,josh,"That's a hell of an example, C.J."
24853,c.j.,Shouldn't you be finding ways to provide aid and comfort for our boys in intelligence?
24854,josh,"You know, they may need some comforting right now. When this crash is over, you'd best  get in some fishnets and head to a bar."
24855,c.j.,I will. 
24856,josh,Yeah?
24857,josh,Where do they come from?
24858,sam,Everywhere. Mostly they come from exactly where you'd expect: places of abject poverty  and despair. Horribly impoverished places are an incubator for the worst kind of crime.
24859,bartlet,Hello...
24860,bartlet, What the hell's going on?
24861,c.j.,"Sir, this is a group of high school students from Presidential Classroom."
24862,bartlet,Ah... Please... 
24863,bartlet,You women seem bright and lovely. The men? Disturbingly dense.
24865,bartlet,Excuse me...  Weren't you coming down to get me some apples and peanut butter?
24866,bartlet," So, we're stuck here, huh?"
24867,bartlet,"Well, I live here."
24868,bartlet, I'm going back to my office. Nice meeting you all.
24870,bartlet, Yeah?
24871,bartlet, I try to be.
24872,bartlet," A martyr would rather suffer death at the hands of  an oppressor than renounce his beliefs. Killing yourself and innocent people to make  a point is sick, twisted, brutal, dumb-ass murder. And let me leave you with this  thought before I go searching for the apples that were rightfully mine: we don't need  martyrs right now. We need heroes. A hero would die for his country but he'd much  rather live for it... It was good meeting you all."
24873,c.j.,"Thank you, Mr. President."
24874,josh,"Thank you, sir."
24878,josh,I think most people also find it important to remember that the whole thing took place  about 73 million years ago.
24882,josh,"Well, all right. That's it then."
24883,josh,Yeah.
24884,josh,No.
24885,josh,You don't have the choices in a war that you do in a jury room. But I - I - I wish...  wish we didn't have to. I think death is too simple.
24886,josh,"I'd put 'em in a small cell, and make them watch home movies of the birthdays and baptisms  and weddings of every single person they killed, over and over, every day, for the rest  of their lives.   Not so much you, Fred."
24887,josh,"Learn things. Be good to each other. Read the newspapers, go the movies, go to a party.  Read a book. In the meantime, remember pluralism. You want to get these people? I mean,  you really want to reach in and kill them where they live? Keep accepting more than one  idea. Makes 'em absolutely crazy."
24888,josh, Go.
24889,josh,See you later. Okay.
24890,josh,Thank you. Thanks a lot. It was fun. Don't steal anything on the way out. Okay.
24891,josh,Billy.  Listen...
24892,josh,"Nothing, just...just keep doing what you're doing."
24893,josh,Okay.  See you.
24894,leo, Good evening.
24895,leo, That's the price you pay... for having the same physical features as criminals.  That's what I was gonna say.
24896,leo,I'm sorry about that. Also about the crack I made about teaching Muslim women how to drive. 
24897,leo,"I think if you talk to people who know me, they'd tell you that... that was unlike me,  you know? We're obviously all under, um... a greater than usual amount of... you know.  And like you pointed out, with the shooting and everything..."
24898,leo,"Yeah.  All right. Well, that's all. "
24899,leo,"Hey, kid..."
24900,leo, Way to be back at your desk.
24901,c.j.,"Tomorrow morning, the President will direct the Attorney General to appoint a Special  Prosecutor, yes.  I... I can't see! Joan?"
24902,c.j.,"A list of three prosecutors is given to a three judge panel. The prosecutors, as well  as the judges, were all appointed by Republican Presidents."
24903,c.j.,I don't know.
24904,c.j.,"I can't comment on a witness list that doesn't exist, I imagine subpoenas will be issued  to most senior White House staff, including myself."
24905,c.j.,I'm sorry?
24906,c.j.,I would imagine.
24907,c.j.,"Again, I can't comment on what kind of hearing Congress has in mind; I'm sure there'll  be one, but you'll have to talk to Congress.  Okay, here now, the  President of the United States. "
24908,c.j.,"Front row, on your right."
24909,bartlet,"Yes, Sandy."
24910,bartlet,"I'm sorry, Sandy, there was a little bit of noise there, can you repeat the question?"
24911,bartlet, Yeah. And I'm going to win.
24912,c.j.,Yeah.
24913,c.j.,"Oh, yeah, thank you, thanks. "
24914,bartlet,Bruno!
24915,bartlet,Give it to Leo. 
24916,c.j.,It's written.
24917,c.j.,What?
24918,c.j.,Mifepristone's...
24919,c.j.,"The FDA is an independent agency, I could get in trouble for even knowing what you just  told me."
24920,c.j.,"Well, I'll be asking one of my 14 lawyers about that. When are they going to announce?"
24921,c.j.,Monday?
24922,c.j.," Okay, thanks. "
24923,josh,C.J.! There are now seven different drafts of the speech.
24924,c.j.,Yeah.
24925,josh,"The President likes none of them. Toby and Doug can't get together, Sam and Doug can't  get together. Leo and Bruno can't get together."
24926,c.j.,"Listen, I've got to talk to you for a second."
24927,josh,"If anyone asks, the speech is done, they're just ironing it a bit..."
24928,c.j.,That's what I've been saying. Listen. 
24929,josh,Yeah.
24930,c.j.,Come here. 
24931,c.j.,Paulson got it from a source the FDA is signing off on RU-486.
24932,josh,When are they going to announce?
24933,c.j.,On Monday.
24934,josh, Come on!
24935,c.j.,Right before the speech.
24936,josh,You didn't take care of this?
24937,c.j.,Josh...
24938,josh,"Damn it, C.J.!"
24939,c.j.,I told all departments no news on Monday. We get the cycle to ourselves. 
24940,josh,Then how?
24941,c.j.,The FDA is an independent agency.
24942,josh,So we're kicking off our campaign on the same day...
24943,c.j.,Yeah.
24944,josh,Perfect.
24945,c.j.,"Look, I'm sorry, but..."
24946,josh,"Yeah, I'm also not wild about pictures of the President getting on the plane without his  wife."
24947,c.j.,I can't computer-generate images of the First Lady.
24948,josh,She's getting in in the morning?
24949,c.j.,We'll do some pictures.
24950,josh,I'm going to call Gail Trent and confirm this other thing.  Maybe we  want to postpone.
24951,c.j.,Why?
24952,josh, I don't know. He's got laryngitis or something.
24953,c.j.,"Listen, anybody asks - the speech is done, we're just putting on some..."
24954,c.j.,What do you mean?
24955,c.j., I wouldn't worry about it.
24956,c.j.,I don't... Connie! 
24957,c.j.,"Yeah. Anybody asks - the speech is done, we're just putting finishing touches on."
24958,c.j.,Thank you.
24959,c.j.,Very soon.
24960,c.j.,"It's done, they're just ironing a few things out. "
24961,c.j.,"Everybody's getting along great, they're dotting the I's and crossing the T's."
24962,sam,This thing reads like an Andy Williams special. We're starting all over again with a  white piece of paper! 
24963,bartlet,Abbey?
24964,bartlet,Listen.
24966,bartlet,Look...
24968,bartlet,"That's funny, 'cause that's sort of what I did."
24970,bartlet,I don't.
24972,bartlet," I don't, I swear."
24974,bartlet,Yeah?
24976,bartlet,Are you going...
24978,bartlet,Abbey...
24980,bartlet,"I'm running again, Abbey."
24982,bartlet,"Look, I have a lot to say..."
24984,bartlet,What?
24986,bartlet,"No, I have to go down, they're going to brief me on the evacuation plan for Haiti."
24988,bartlet,You'll be up later?
24990,bartlet,Probably three or four.
24992,bartlet,Not usually.
24994,josh, Donna!
24996,josh,The motorcade left without me. I had to drive back with Ed and Larry.
24998,josh,"Not faster than the Presidential motorcade, no.  Uh, set up a conference call so Cabinet Affairs can  brief."
25000,josh,Yeah. I need congressional leaders.  
25002,josh,No.
25004,josh,"Me, too."
25006,josh,"Set up the calls, would you? "
25007,josh,Toby.
25008,toby,"Leo's got to... uh, cancel everything on the public schedule tomorrow."
25009,josh,Done.
25010,toby,You are talking with Cabinet Affairs?
25011,josh,Donna is setting up the call. Why aren't you smiling?
25012,toby,I'm wet.
25013,josh,I'm wet and I'm smiling.
25014,toby,I'm smiling on the inside. Ginger?
25015,toby,"Public Liaison wrote up talking points two hours ago. Pull them, they're no good anymore.  "
25016,sam, Public Liaison?
25017,toby,Yeah.
25018,sam, Half an hour!
25019,toby," Fifteen minutes! Sam, we've got to..."
25020,sam, You'd better...
25021,toby,"Okay, let's try not to do that a lot. "
25022,sam, Why isn't he smiling?
25023,josh,On the inside. 
25024,sam,We've got to round up the medical experts for the morning shows and we need to divvy up  the columnists. Nancy? 
25025,sam,I need to see C.J. as soon as she's free.
25026,sam,"Well, get her on the phone. "
25027,toby, And we need Oliver Babish.
25028,josh,You want to put him in the Briefing Room tomorrow?
25029,toby,Send a message we're not worried about the legal side.
25030,bartlet, What are you all looking at?
25031,toby,"Good evening, Mr. President."
25032,bartlet,What do you guys think the news is going to lead with tomorrow?
25033,leo, Sir.
25034,bartlet, Yeah. 
25035,sam, Haiti?
25036,josh,Yeah.
25037,toby,All right. Don't worry about Haiti. Let's do what we have to. 
25038,bartlet, Good evening!
25039,bartlet,Yeah.
25040,leo,What's in the LHA?
25041,leo,That's for cargo and ammunition?
25042,leo,Where do you launch?
25043,bartlet,"So these helicopters land on the roof, and then..."
25044,bartlet,What are the possibilities there'll be Haitian civilian casualties?
25045,bartlet,How long do I have?
25046,bartlet,OK. Thank you.
25047,bartlet,Yeah.
25048,leo,Yeah!
25049,leo,Bruno...
25050,leo,Look...
25051,leo,"No, I don't think I will hand on. Who told Doug to write a draft?"
25052,leo,Who told him?
25053,leo,"It's got an apology. Also, it stinks. "
25054,leo,Yeah.
25055,leo,He's not going to apologize.
25056,leo,Because it's his official campaign announcement and not Oprah Winfrey.
25057,leo,I honestly believe it might. 
25058,leo,"In four weeks, he has made a full disclosure of his health. He's educated the public  about MS, he's done this every day. He has done everything..."
25059,leo, You think he apologizes and his numbers go up?
25060,leo,They have.
25061,leo,I've got to make calls. Talk to me about this in town. 
25062,josh, Listen.
25063,c.j.,Sit down. We're landing.
25064,josh,I talked to Gail Trent.
25065,c.j.,And?
25066,josh,And she confirmed it. The FDA's going to announce.
25067,c.j.,On Monday?
25068,josh,Yeah. What are they talking about back there?
25069,c.j.,Leo and Bruno?
25070,josh,Yeah.
25071,c.j.,The lack of yeast in our numbers. Yeast is a fun word to say.
25072,josh,I'm sorry I got in your face before.
25073,c.j.,Our numbers are less than yeasty.
25074,josh,They are.
25075,toby,We need a new poll in the field right now.
25076,josh,Yeah?
25077,sam,I'll tell you why.
25078,josh,Because the first one was bogus.
25079,sam,Totally bogus. And I'll tell you why.
25080,c.j.,"1,170 voters in one industrial state isn't representative of the whole country."
25081,josh,"Plus, people respond differently to voting out the governor versus a sitting President."
25082,sam,"In charge, if at all possible and I'll tell you what else... "
25083,sam,Always scored high on the trustworthy scale. 
25084,c.j.,So he has a bit of a shield to protect him from character attacks.
25085,sam,"Yes, he does. Not to mention that the information presented during the interview informed  the public that MS isn't a fatal disease."
25086,c.j.,We need to put a poll in the field right now.
25087,toby,Than you all for coming around to the self-evident point I made five minutes ago.
25088,josh,What happened?
25089,josh,"Mine, too. I got a ride with Larry and Ed."
25090,josh,I just thought you were happy.
25091,josh,Which one of us are you talking to?
25092,josh,We know.
25093,sam,Yes.
25094,toby, This is a lot like DuPont Circle.
25095,josh,"We're there already, Jo."
25096,josh,Put a poll in the field.
25097,josh,The hotel's up on the right.
25099,josh,A pill that will abort a pregnancy up to 49 days.
25101,josh,Yes.
25103,josh,Yes.
25104,josh,"See, I think you're thinking that somehow this pill means more sex for you."
25106,josh,"Of course, you're for it. I'm for it. Everybody's for it. Just not on Monday."
25108,josh," A, it will get folded into our news cycle when we want it to ourselves.  B, it will give the pro-lifers something to scream about. And C, it'll look like the  campaign screwed up, so the press'll write a process story instead of writing about our  issues."
25110,josh,Not on Monday. I'm checking in. 
25111,toby,"M&Ms from Air Force One, Lois."
25112,toby,"Yes, thank you."
25113,toby,"I read it, yes."
25114,toby,He's not going to apologize.
25115,toby,We're starting over.
25116,toby,I've done this before.
25117,toby,Don't talk about military strategy in a conversation like this.
25118,toby, You wanna speak up? I'm not sure the entire White  House Press Corps heard you.
25119,toby,Is he in?
25120,leo,Hey.
25121,toby,Joey's putting a poll in the field first thing in the morning.
25122,leo,"Good. That first poll was bogus and I'll tell you why. 1,170 people in Michigan can't  possibly..."
25123,toby,"Leo, Leo, we've been through this."
25124,leo,"Alright. Well, good."
25125,toby,Where's the President?
25126,leo,In the residence.
25127,toby,How's the first lady?
25128,leo,"You know, I think with everything on our plates, we don't really need to be marriage  counselors."
25129,leo,They're ready?
25130,leo,Here we go. 
25131,leo,Where are we?
25132,leo,How long does it take?
25133,leo,Then they haul ass to Paris?Officer 2 nods.
25134,leo,Not bad. How about you?
25135,leo,You had your hands full.
25136,leo,Yeah.
25137,leo,"Let's not doing that right now, huh?"
25138,leo,The silence makes me crazy. 
25139,leo,"All right. Well, we're in it now."
25140,c.j.,"Our hotel is located just a few miles from the site of John Goffe's mill.  ""Hunter John, as he was called, was granted the land as a reward for his  services to the colony in the French and Indian wars."" Let me tell you something. We  don't do that enough anymore."
25141,sam," Challenges, right? Challenges is better  than difficulties."
25142,c.j.,"Yes.  ""Later in life, he built the water-powered grist mill with his son,  Colonel John Goffe, and his grandson, Major John Goffe."" The Goffes."
25143,sam,"Is ""challenges"" gonna make us think that one of the difficulties is that he got MS?"
25144,c.j.,It's going to make us think he's up for challenges.
25145,sam,I agree.
25146,toby, C.J.?
25147,c.j.,Yeah?
25148,toby,Wanna play some pool?
25149,c.j.,I don't know how to play pool.
25150,toby,Then you wanna play for money?
25151,c.j.,Sure. 
25152,toby, What are you doing?
25153,c.j.,"I'm drawing inspiration from the strength of the Goffe family. The descendents of Hunter  John have been owners and operators of the Goffe Family Mill for more than two centuries  now.  ""In 1845, when Theodore `Ody' Goffe was the proprietor, the mill burned to  the ground."" Well, that totally blows."
25154,c.j.,"Again, I can tell you that the operation was launched from the deck of the USS  Enterprise, about 60 miles off the coast of Haiti. If you need more details about  troops and equipment, I'm going to have to refer you to the Pentagon."
25155,c.j.,That's right.
25156,c.j.,His state of mind was he's commander in chief.
25157,c.j.,He'd been through a TV. interview and a press conference. The President finds you all  annoying but not prohibitively debilitating.
25158,c.j.,Chris.
25159,c.j.,The President's MS isn't life threatening...
25160,c.j., Steve.
25161,c.j.,Sorry?
25162,c.j.,He told me a week ago.
25163,c.j.,No. Leo McGarry told me.
25164,c.j.,Because Leo McGarry told me.
25165,c.j.,"Just good friends, Katie."
25166,josh,It's getting away from her a little.
25167,c.j., I'm not answering that.
25168,josh," Yeah. Listen, I wanted to ask you about something."
25169,josh,"The Justice Department wants another $30 million to fund its suit against the tobacco  companies and we want them to have it. The Appropriations Subcommittee on Justice, State  and Commerce handles that money and they won't bring it to a vote."
25170,josh,"Yeah. Now, I wanted to turn the heat up and issue a release."
25171,josh,Yeah. It calls them well-fed members lining their campaign war chests and being complicit  in hundreds of thousands of negligent homicide.
25172,josh,"We didn't send the release out yesterday because of the MS announcement and Mrs.  Landingham. But in a day or two, I wanna leak it. What do you think?"
25173,josh,Why?
25174,josh,I'm raising the profile to bring public opinion down on him. Play defense with that.
25175,josh,Watch me.
25176,josh,No sweat. 
25177,c.j.,It's because I don't believe it has anything to do with the President's sharing his  health information with the general public.
25178,c.j., The Pentagon briefing's scheduled for 3 this afternoon. I'll keep you posted with  the changes.
25179,toby," Leo talked to me, you know."
25180,c.j.,Hmm?
25181,toby,I said Leo talked to me.
25182,c.j.,Yeah?
25183,toby, Yeah.
25184,c.j.,About what?
25185,toby, Your shot.
25186,c.j.," Strategically, I felt that was the wise thing  to do."
25187,toby,Leo talked to me. I know what you're thinking about doing.
25188,bartlet,We're talking about a display of force?
25189,bartlet,And what is he up against?
25190,josh,Isn't it possible they can shoot at us again?
25191,bartlet,It picks up weapons signals?
25192,bartlet," Peter, State's exploring the effectiveness of immediate sanctions?"
25193,josh,With terrible results that hurt the wrong people.
25194,bartlet,We'll have a refugee crisis.
25195,bartlet," All right, let's go here. Nancy, Peter, get a message to the Canadian prime  minister - we intend to restore Dessaline. The Canadians should tell Bazan if he doesn't  move out we're willing to move forward with military options. In the mean time, I'm  willing to consider a fly-by."
25196,bartlet,Now you're just bugging me.  That's all.
25197,josh,Sir...
25198,bartlet,Yeah?
25199,josh,We should bear in mind that if we end up invading Haiti there'll be a belief...
25200,bartlet,That it was politically motivated.
25201,toby,Yeah. That at the... at the very least we welcomed the opportunity both to distract  attention from the MS story and show strength as commander in chief.
25202,bartlet,You think it's a sign of strength to invade Haiti? 
25203,josh,I meant...
25204,bartlet,Missouri could invade Haiti.
25205,josh,Yes.
25206,bartlet,"Sanctions aren't going to work - you said it yourself. The Haitian National Police will  get rich of the contraband. Dessaline was democratically elected and instead of sitting  in his office he's sitting on the USS Enterprise. To say nothing of the fact that they  shot at us, and you don't get to do that."
25207,toby,Sir...
25208,bartlet,I'm late. 
25209,toby,Everybody's tired.
25210,josh,"You know, at some point we're going to have to check the First Lady's temperature."
25211,toby,"Okay, you first."
25212,josh, Yeah.
25213,toby,"On Haiti, tell your people to be careful with public posture - not to say or do anything  that could taint any of the options."
25214,josh,Nobody wants to invade...
25215,toby,Nobody wants to contemplate invading until we've exhausted diplomatic options.
25216,josh,Yeah.
25217,toby,Charlie!
25218,toby,You want to play?
25219,toby,I am writing.
25220,toby,"""We can sit back and admit with grave sensitivity that life isn't fair and the  less-advantaged are destined to their lot in life and the problems of those on the  other side of the world should stay there, that our leaders are cynical and can never  be an instrument to change, but that, my friends, is not worthy of you, it's not worthy  of the President, it's not worthy of a great nation, it's not worthy of America!"" Paper's  for wimps. Wanna play?"
25221,toby,I understand it's because you're scared.
25222,toby,"I'm saying if you're a scared chicken, I understand."
25223,toby,Yeah.
25224,toby,I'll give you the break.
25225,toby,"Nice game, it was fun to watch."
25226,toby,Charlie... The President and the First Lady...
25227,toby,Sorry.
25228,toby,No...
25229,toby,"No, you're right. You know what? Look, it's a typical marriage, I've been there."
25230,josh,"I said to you, I said this - I said: ""Do you want food?"""
25232,josh,"And you said, ""No, I don't want any food."""
25234,josh,"And now, you're eating my food."
25236,josh,Are you...eating the rest of the sandwich?
25238,josh, How you doing?
25239,josh,What's the problem?
25240,josh,"I'm not sure you can say ""stomachs ache with the pain."""
25242,josh, I'm eating it. 
25243,leo,Why are people here? 
25244,leo,I came to the bar to have some privacy.
25245,leo, What are you two doing here?
25246,leo,Tomorrow.
25247,josh,I need to talk to you... The FDA's gonna approve RU-486.
25248,leo,How do you know?
25249,josh,C.J. had a source.
25250,leo,You're not supposed to have that information.
25251,josh,"The source was non-governmental. Leo, they're doing it on Monday."
25252,leo,You've confirmed it?
25253,josh,"As well as I can. I've been at it most of the night. I'd like to go through back  channels, see if I can hold 'em off."
25254,leo, No.
25255,josh,Then I think we have to consider postponing the speech. 
25256,leo,I'm going out to see the President first thing in the morning. Let me talk to him.
25257,josh,All right.
25258,leo,All right.
25259,josh,Early numbers?
25260,sam," ""How much faith and confidence do you have in President Bartlet? Great Deal:  21%, Somewhat: 24%, Only a Little:15%."""
25261,sam,We got 45% in the top two boxes. That's better than we thought. 
25262,josh," ""Do you feel he's physically able to perform his duties as President?"""
25263,josh,What's the bottom line?
25264,sam,And if the election were held today?
25265,sam,He's in the ball game. 
25266,josh,"All right, I'm gonna set up some meetings for tomorrow. We'll have the final numbers for  this set and we'll figure out where to go from here. Thanks everybody."
25267,sam,Josh?
25268,josh,Yeah?
25269,sam,"Listen, I was talking to Toby earlier."
25270,josh,"Hey, Ginger."
25271,sam, Hey.
25272,sam,And I was saying that actually he hasn't apologized.
25273,josh,What do you mean? 
25274,sam,I looked over the transcript and he hasn't apologized.
25275,josh,"Yeah, well, I don't know what to say."
25276,sam,Yeah.
25277,josh,Let me ask you something.
25278,sam,Yeah.
25279,josh,The release I wrote about the tobacco appropriations...
25280,sam,Yeah.
25281,josh,What would you think about my leaking it to the subcommittee? 
25282,sam,I wouldn't do it. 
25283,josh,I'm doing it. 
25284,sam,Okay...So you don't think we're gonna get hung with the apology?
25285,josh,Hang on.
25286,c.j.,It's five F-18 fighters and an E-2 Hawkeye.
25287,c.j.,Steve.
25288,c.j.,The President's expressed his gratitude and his concern to the Marines and their families.
25289,c.j.,"No, the President's health isn't a matter of concern. "
25290,c.j.,The conversation was focused on the Marines and their contribution to our national  security. 
25291,c.j.,Mark.
25292,c.j.," Yeah, they're being considered economic refugees and diverted to  Guantanamo Bay. "
25293,c.j., Carl.
25294,c.j.,That's not a factor. 
25295,c.j.,Joan.
25296,c.j.,"Again, that's not a factor. "
25297,c.j.,Joan?
25298,c.j.,"To be honest with you, Carl, I think the President's relieved to be focusing on something  that matters. "
25299,c.j.,"Obviously, what I meant to say was..."
25300,c.j., Obviously what I...
25301,sam, Toby...
25302,toby, I don't believe it.
25303,sam,You saw it?
25304,toby,I was standing right there. 
25305,sam,"""He's relieved""...he might have to send troops into battle? "
25306,sam,"""He's relieved""...he might have to put American lives at risk and kill Haitian civilians  'cause it takes his mind off having lied to the electorate?"
25307,toby, C.J...
25308,c.j., Just... just don't say anything for a... just don't say anything for a.... 
25309,c.j., Dammit!
25310,leo,What about it?
25311,leo,The press release?
25312,leo, Hang on. 
25313,leo,Holy hell.
25314,josh,"""Relieved""? The President's relieved to be focusing on Haiti?"
25315,toby,I was there.
25316,josh,Isn't this exactly what we said we had to be careful of?
25317,leo,What happened?
25318,josh,She was asked if the President's situation makes it harder for him to focus on Haiti. 
25319,sam, There was a ramp-up.
25320,josh,There was a ramp-up but she was asked...
25321,leo,What did she say?
25322,josh,She said the President's relieved to be focusing on something that matters.
25323,leo,"""Relieved""?"
25324,toby,We can argue that...uh...she just misspoke. 
25325,josh,She meant to say that the President realizes he's focusing on something that matters.
25326,toby,Or the President's reiterating that his focus is on something...
25327,sam,"I don't like ""something that matters,"" like finding out the President lied doesn't matter."
25328,toby,"She misspoke is all we need. We go back, we say that she misspoke."
25329,leo, It's  gonna look like he ordered a military operation to cover up...
25330,toby,She goes back. She says she was tired.
25331,leo,C.J. doesn't misspeak!
25332,josh, She just did. 
25333,leo," If she misspoke, why didn't she clean it up in the Briefing Room?  I mean, come to think of it, why didn't she clean it up in the Briefing Room?"
25334,sam,"She actually is tired, Leo. We all are."
25335,leo," Well, why don't we go with that, Sam? Let's go out and say  we're all tired. The President's tired. Complications due to MS."
25336,sam,We haven't had much time...
25337,leo, You had a week. How much time do you need?
25338,sam, Some of us have had more time than others!
25339,leo,Margaret?
25340,leo,Is he alone?
25341,leo,Come up with something.
25342,leo," You live in the middle of nowhere, you know that?"
25343,bartlet,Awasiwi Odanack. It's a Abenaki phrase that means...
25344,leo," ...""beyond the village."""
25345,bartlet," ...""beyond the village."""
25346,leo,"Yeah.  Good morning, Mr. President."
25347,bartlet,You want coffee?
25348,leo, No.
25349,bartlet,What's happening? 
25350,leo,C.J.'s got it from a non-governmental source - the FDA's gonna announce their approval  of RU-486.
25351,bartlet,When?
25352,leo,Monday.
25353,bartlet,"Yeah, all right."
25354,leo,Why don't we consider postponing the speech?
25355,bartlet,Why?
25356,leo,You've got laryngitis.
25357,bartlet," Yeah, no, I mean, why?"
25358,leo,It'll get wrapped up in the news...
25359,bartlet,It'll get wrapped up in one news cycle. I don't give a...
25360,leo,It will. Plus it gives meat to the right. Lets the press write a process story. Right out  of the gate the Bartlet campaign is pandering and bumbling and performing abortions in  the Rose Garden.
25361,bartlet,"Screw it, and screw anybody who writes that story."
25362,leo,"Plus, I have a hunch the first round of subpoenas'll be handed down this week."
25363,bartlet, You have a hunch? 
25364,leo,Look...
25365,bartlet,"Of course the first round of subpoenas'll be handed down this week. If we announce in two  weeks, that's when the first round of subpoenas will be handed down!  Screw it!  It's game time. Let's go!"
25366,leo,"This is a nice piece of land. It'd be better without the... floodlights and the metal  detectors, but..."
25367,bartlet,Yeah.
25368,leo,Abbey and the girls are getting in this morning?
25369,bartlet,  How's everybody doing?
25370,leo, Fine.
25371,bartlet, What about C.J.? 
25372,bartlet,All right.  Laryngitis?
25373,leo, I don't know.
25374,bartlet,We could just say I have MS.
25375,leo,Yeah...
25376,bartlet,Leo?
25377,leo,"Yes, sir?"
25378,bartlet,"I'm running for reelection, and I'm gonna win."
25379,bartlet," We are more than a set of borders. We are bounded by the reach of human  freedom. We have mastered every moment. We have vanquished every foe. We are strong.  We are prosperous. We are at peace with the world. We are, as we have ever been, the  envy of every civilization. We are, as we have ever been, the hope of all mankind. But  I am not satisfied. Indeed, I am restless. And I come before not to speak of the America  we have, but of the Amer...."
25380,toby,Excuse me?
25381,bartlet,Yeah?
25382,toby,We are the envy of every civilization?
25383,toby,(laughs) Really?
25384,sam,"Well, they do, actually."
25385,toby,We know what he meant. Thank you.
25386,sam,"(to Bartlet) I'll change it, sir."
25387,bartlet,Okay.
25388,toby,(indicating Doug) Could somebody stick some pom-poms in that guy's hands?
25389,bartlet,"(reading) ""But I am not satisfied. Indeed, I am restless. And I come before you not to  speak of the America we have, but of the better, stronger, more prosperous America we  can create together."""
25390,c.j.,There's a snake over there. (All look.)
25391,sam,(walking toward it) What kind?
25392,c.j.,"I don't know and I don't want to ask him. Can somebody shoot it, please?"
25393,sam,(looking at it) Probably a garter snake. 
25394,bartlet,It's a garter snake. Don't worry about it.
25395,c.j.,Okay.
25396,bartlet,"(reading) ""I seek re-election to the presidency, not because of its glories, but because  of its challenges..."""
25397,bartlet,Yeah?
25398,sam,I wrote that.
25399,sam,No. It's exactly the right time to raise the stakes of the election.
25400,toby,"Cause if it's all day at the beach, any bozo with a handshake can do it."
25401,josh,"(to Bartlet) It's true, sir. America does not want Dr. Kervorkian to lead the country.  We've got polling data on that."
25402,bartlet,All right. We'll revisit that.
25403,c.j.,The snake is looking at me now.
25404,bartlet,"(reading) ""A presidential candidate owes his campaign no less than he owes his country;  everything he has, everything he can give, all his hope..."
25405,bartlet,Yeah?
25406,sam,The people who're going to be there hear fine.
25407,josh,"Okay, I see the snake now, too."
25408,toby,"Sir, you're perfectly entitled to declare yourself the leader of the campaign and the  country, since, after all, you are."
25409,bartlet,(joking) Does somebody her have M.S. and they haven't said anything?
25410,josh,"Seriously, that's a pretty big snake."
25411,bartlet,"(reading) ""But I am not satisfied."" Indeed, Leo, I am close to taking my own life with  a wheat thresher."
25412,leo,Bruno?
25413,bartlet,"""And so with pride and purpose, I hereby announce my candidacy for the presidency of the  United States."""
25415,bartlet, I didn't see you there...
25417,bartlet,I didn't see you.
25419,bartlet,"Peter thinks sanctions are a waste of time and I agree. In about half an hour we're  buzzing the island with... uh, what they call an Alpha strike formation - to show  Bazan... I don't know. "
25422,bartlet," Sorry, I said I don't know, we'll see."
25424,bartlet,"Yeah, it was bound to happen. "
25428,bartlet,"Ah, it's Leo's call."
25430,bartlet," Yeah, it's Leo's call. Look, I'm sorry, I can't get into our thing tonight."
25432,bartlet,"I do, that's why I can't get into it. I have to read."
25434,bartlet,"All right, I'm going to the study. "
25436,bartlet," Abbey, you were lying down when I came in. I didn't see you."
25438,sam,We're selling the greatness of America.
25439,sam,"We're selling it in paragraphs one, two, eight, sixteen, twenty-six, thirty-six... "
25440,sam,"America ""rocks?"""
25441,toby,"Bartlet... ""rocks?"""
25442,josh,He really doesn't... that much. Leo? Can I see you for a second?
25443,leo,Yeah. 
25444,leo,There's nothing we can do...
25445,josh,The last thing we need is to come out of the gate waving a flag to the American  heartland...
25446,leo,"Look, Josh..."
25447,josh,...saying we don't share your values.
25448,leo,The President understands all that.
25449,josh,And?
25450,leo,That's the way it goes. 
25451,josh, Leo!
25452,leo,The FDA is an independent agency. They can announce when they want.
25453,josh,The FDA is a division of HHS and technically not an independent agency.
25454,leo,Technically?
25455,josh,"I can keep the President away from this. I can call the FDA's chief of staff, I got  him his job... They can wait..."
25456,leo,No!
25457,josh,Two weeks - to announce the drug. They don't have to do it on Monday. I can fix tobacco.
25458,leo,Tobacco?
25459,josh," No, I meant 486."
25460,leo,Leave the FDA alone. 
25461,c.j.,Good morning!
25463,c.j.,You just get in?
25465,c.j.,Ellie and Zoey are here?
25467,c.j.,"No, thank you, I can't. But I do want to talk to you about a photo-op."
25469,c.j.,"No, I'm fine."
25471,c.j.,"Okay. So, at any rate..."
25473,c.j.,Yes.
25475,c.j.,Yeah.
25477,c.j.,That'd be nice if...
25479,c.j.,"Ma'am, this is uncomfortable territory and obviously, I... The press has sources that  say that you and the President..."
25481,c.j.,I'm sorry?
25483,c.j.,"No, these are..."
25485,c.j.,"Yes, ma'am."
25486,leo,Hmmm?
25487,c.j.,I spoke to the First Lady. I thought it might not be a bad idea if there were some  opportunities with the two of them together at the house.
25488,leo,What was her reaction?
25489,c.j.,"Well, she denied me cider. "
25490,leo,What else?
25491,c.j.,I'll brief the Sunday papers on what they can expect from the speech on Monday.
25492,leo,You know it's not written yet.
25493,c.j.,I'm just giving them highlights.
25494,leo,What highlights?
25495,c.j.,I'll make them up!
25496,leo,Okay.
25497,c.j.,I thought maybe you could speak to her. 
25498,leo,Who?
25499,c.j.,The First Lady.
25500,leo,"Look, I..."
25501,c.j.,Every paper today had a picture on the front page of the President boarding Air Force One  to go home by himself.
25502,leo,It's a Saturday paper. 
25503,c.j.,There are any number of press questions about...
25504,leo,"We're two private men, C.J. We don't talk about our marriages. What do you want from me?"
25505,c.j.,I'm not wild about the fact that you told Toby what we discussed.
25506,leo,"He's the communications director, you don't think he should know?"
25507,c.j.,When I think it's time...
25508,c.j.,"Yeah, okay. "
25509,leo,It's as close as we come these days.
25510,bartlet,What does he want?
25511,leo,"Ten million dollars US, a private plane and a guarantee we won't be prosecuted for the  war crimes."
25512,bartlet,What else?
25513,leo,Asylum for himself and sixty of his family members.
25514,bartlet,Where?!
25515,leo,Here.
25516,bartlet,"Well, that's a bit of a dilemma. Does anybody have room at their place for Bazan and  sixty of his relatives?"
25517,bartlet,Yeah.
25518,bartlet,"I want to handle this peacefully and right now. Nancy, what do you think of Venezuela?"
25519,bartlet,"Tell them I'll give the SPR strong consideration. Mike, have the Canadians get a message  through: we'll unfreeze his US accounts but he can't remove any money from Haiti. Only  his wife, his children and his parents can seek asylum. If he tries to go back, he'll be  under arrest."
25520,leo,And he can screw the private plane. We'll fly him on a C-9 from Port-au-Prince to Caracas  and if he's very good we won't shoot him in the head on the way.
25521,bartlet,Tell me when it's done.
25522,leo,Nancy?
25523,leo,Let me talk to you a second. 
25524,leo,"When this is a done deal, I want you to stick around for a while and brief the press."
25525,leo,I'm not punishing her.
25526,leo,"I'm not punishing her! You're not the political face of this administration, you're no  part of the MS thing and you won't be asked questions about it."
25527,leo,I don't care. 
25528,sam,Can I talk to him?
25529,sam,"Hey, good news about Haiti."
25530,sam,Manifest Destiny?
25531,leo, Calls?
25532,sam,You got a second?
25533,leo,Yeah.
25534,sam,"So, I wanted to apologize about before."
25535,leo,Don't worry about it.
25536,sam,You know what I'm talking about?
25537,leo,Yeah.
25538,sam,So I wanted to make you aware of something.
25539,leo,Yeah.
25540,sam,"Well, I've looked through the transcript a couple of times, and he never apologized."
25541,leo,What do you mean?
25542,sam,In the interview - he never apologized and I think that's something we're going to be  humbled with later.
25543,leo,"Well, let's wait a few weeks, see what happens with the numbers and take another look."
25544,sam,Yeah.
25545,leo,Anything else?
25546,sam,He wanted a private plane?
25547,leo,Can you believe it?
25548,bartlet,"The State Department's suggesting that we praise the French government for their help  in resolving this matter. I would, but I'm worried they'd surrender."
25549,leo,"You did well, Mr. President. "
25550,bartlet,When do you think C.J. can brief?
25551,leo,Nancy can brief.
25552,bartlet,Yeah?
25553,leo,Don't worry about it. You did well.
25554,leo,"We haven't picked up any ground in Iowa, Kansas, Arkansas, and Illinois."
25555,c.j.,It's only been a week.
25556,leo,"Yeah, but we struck the agricultural trade deal with Argentina and the farm country  ought to love that."
25557,c.j.,"Well, that story got a little drowned out."
25558,leo,"Yes, it did. "
25559,c.j.,I could have stood on top of the Sears Tower with a Stratacaster and that story would  have been drowned out!
25560,leo,I'm not assigning blame.
25561,c.j.,Really?
25562,leo,Yes. We need help. I'm bringing in Bruno Gianelli.
25563,c.j.,It's too early for Bruno.
25564,leo,No.
25565,c.j.,"Toby, Sam and Josh... the guys aren't gonna like it!"
25566,leo,They'll have to live with it. 
25567,sam,Oh my god.
25568,toby,I think Sam wants to take this one.
25569,sam,If you want to substitute 'testosterone' for foreign policy...
25570,sam,You want to have the President wade out into the crowd and challenge it to an arm-wrestle?
25571,sam,You just wrote of 98 percent of the world's population and three quarters of the  President's job description.
25572,toby,It's that kind of thinking that makes us the envy of every civilization.
25573,sam, Scrap this.
25574,sam,Where?
25575,toby,What's that?
25576,toby,It was a little damage control needed to be done.
25577,toby,A month ago 74 percent of them thought MS was fatal.
25578,toby," God, why the hell didn't I think of that?!"
25579,leo, Why didn't you send him in?
25580,leo,I meant... I did it!
25581,leo,Yes.
25582,leo, Bruno!
25583,leo,We might be running out.
25584,leo,Look.
25585,leo,What would you have done?
25586,leo,That'd be concealing the truth.
25587,leo, Can you help us?
25588,leo,Joey Lucas has been polling every day for two months. 
25589,leo,Yeah.
25590,leo, What do you want?
25591,leo,Why don't we say 12?
25592,leo,Fine.
25593,leo,Fine.
25594,leo,No.
25595,leo,Can't have it.
25596,leo,Can't do it.
25597,leo,Knock yourself out.  Margaret!
25598,leo,Would you take Mr. Gianelli into the Oval Office please?
25599,bartlet, Bruno!
25600,bartlet,I understand you're going to be working with us.
25601,bartlet,You have one or two demands.
25602,bartlet,You want 12 percent of the ad buys.
25603,bartlet,"A room, a car, and a driver, that's no problem."
25604,bartlet,No.
25605,bartlet,"I'm sorry, Bruno. Leo runs the show."
25606,bartlet,It's a deal breaker.
25607,bartlet,Can you help us out?
25608,leo, Get out!
25609,leo,How'd it go?
25610,leo,What's first?
25611,leo,After that?
25612,leo,How's two weeks from Monday?
25613,leo,Yeah.
25614,sam,Yeah!
25615,sam,It was part of the deal.
25616,sam,"They're the Columbia high school marching band, they get to play their song."
25617,sam,Look...
25618,toby,Bruno!
25619,toby,Good. Whose throat do I shove these down? Whose skull do I crack with this sign?
25620,toby,"""Bartlet for President."""
25621,toby," Good, 'cause I was there when he won. I saw him get sworn in, I actually  rode in a limo..."
25622,c.j.,We'll be using this as the Green room. He can walk right out the door and up on stage.
25623,josh,What's this room usually used for?
25624,c.j.,"I don't know: desks, a black board, could be some kind of a classroom?"
25625,c.j.,Yeah.
25626,josh,What's going on?
25627,c.j.,What do you mean?  Nothing.
25628,josh,You sure?
25629,c.j.,Yeah. 
25630,c.j.,What's going on with RU-486?
25631,josh,Leo won't let me wave off the FDA.
25632,c.j.,That's against the law.
25633,josh," Yeah, I'm not talking about sticking out the fruit stand -  a phone call, a favor from a friend. I know the Chief of Staff at the subcommittee,  I got him his job."
25634,c.j.,You mean the FDA?
25635,josh,This is the second time this weekend I've done that.
25636,c.j., We're taking care of it.
25637,toby,"No, I'm taking care of it."
25638,toby,I want to say for maybe the eighteenth time that I don't an announcement event at all.
25639,toby,He did that two weeks ago.
25640,josh,"If we put him up there like any other candidate, we trade away the one big advantage  we've got."
25641,toby,He's the President already?
25642,toby,He's not going to apologize.
25643,toby,For what?
25644,toby,Me?
25645,toby,I'm from the United States of suck my...
25646,josh,All right! Let's take lunch.
25647,josh,Yeah.
25648,josh,Sure.
25649,josh,Who?
25650,josh,That we're arrogant?
25651,josh,I guess that means Doug won't be coming to my sweet sixteen then.
25652,josh,What press releases?
25653,josh,"Yes, I was."
25654,josh,You think?
25655,josh,"I got two years as legislative director in the House, two years as floor director in  the Senate, and thirty months as Deputy Chief of Staff. What do you got?"
25656,josh,Kalmbach's a fat-ass Rotarian gasbag. I knew once I sent the thing he'd raise the  profile and give us the press we needed.
25657,josh,"We got the money, Bruno."
25658,bartlet,I've never been nervous talking in front of big crowds. It's talking to one person...   I didn't know  you were going to be here.
25660,bartlet,I thought Leo was gonna...
25662,bartlet,Okay.
25664,bartlet,"No, I think it's a good idea."
25667,bartlet,I don't know enough about agriculture.
25669,bartlet,"Yeah, well, agriculture is responsible for one in five American jobs, so it is a little  bit my field."
25671,bartlet,"15 percent of the world's cotton, 25 percent of the world's beef, and 50 percent of  the world's soybeans are grown in my field; farmers and ranchers pay taxes in my field,  their kids go to school in my field, they go to jail in my field. From time to time they  go to war in my field."
25673,bartlet,"So when I say 'it's not my field,' I'm not saying something, I'm trying to learn so I can."
25675,bartlet,Why aren't you with me?
25677,bartlet,You're not.
25679,bartlet,I'm trying to read here.
25681,bartlet,Abbey...
25683,bartlet,Look...
25685,bartlet, Can I go a week without explaining myself?
25687,bartlet,"Sit down, we'll talk about it right now."
25689,bartlet," Isn't there any way I could change your mind, 'cause I really had my  heart set on it."
25691,leo,You feel all right?
25692,bartlet,Yeah. C.J. wants her to introduce me.
25693,leo,"Yeah, I thought it was a good idea, too."
25694,bartlet,I wouldn't mind a little... you know. There's gonna be a big crowd here tomorrow.
25695,leo,"Well, that's your kind of crowd."
25696,bartlet,I need to finish the speech. 
25697,leo,Yeah.
25698,toby,What are you doing?
25699,sam,Hmm?
25700,toby,What are you doing? (beat) Going over the transcript?
25701,sam,He needs to apologize.
25702,toby,Don't worry about it.
25703,sam,He lied.
25704,toby,"He didn't lie. It's what your people call a ""sin of omission."""
25705,sam,I'm not Catholic. (walks to Toby) It's what everybody calls a sin of omission.  Bartlet lied to us.
25706,toby,"President Bartlet, Sam. Come on. Did you know that many Multiple Sclerosis advocates  actually instruct victims to hide the illness because it's so misunderstood?"
25707,sam,You think they instruct presidential candidates to do that? 
25708,toby,I don't.
25709,sam,That night he told you?
25710,toby,Yeah?
25711,sam,Didn't you feel like...
25712,toby,I went crazy. I whaled on him in the Oval Office.
25713,sam,None of us had the chance to do that.
25714,toby,I know.
25715,sam,"We could have gotten it done. If he just told us at the beginning, this could have been  a whole different..."
25716,toby,Yeah. Go home. (walks away)
25717,sam,All right.
25718,sam,Hey.
25719,sam,Talking to myself.
25720,sam,Feel free. 
25721,sam,It's not locked 'til the president says it's locked.
25722,sam,New Hampshire. Live free or cheap.
25723,sam,"Connie, it seems to me your job is to wait until Doug leaves the room and then say,  ""What Doug really meant was..."" How much they pay you for that?"
25724,sam,Yeah. 
25725,sam,Is this what you mean or is this what Doug means?
25726,sam,It's not going to happen.
25727,sam,Cause Jed Bartlet's Jed Bartlet and that's the way it goes.
25728,sam,What?
25729,sam,I haven't thought that much about it.
25730,sam,There's been a lot going on and I haven't really thought that much about it.
25731,sam,"Connie, please. It's President Bartlet. Okay?"
25732,sam,I should get back up to the hotel. (turns to leave)
25733,toby,"(reading) ""My `values' are New Hampshire's `values' hard work and responsibility, strong  families and strong communities, a boundless faith in American idea of self-reliance.""  And poor people can go screw themselves."
25734,toby,"Well, if that's your point, nobody's going to understand it."
25735,toby,(sarcastically) Are there any problems you're interested in solving or are you helping  us run for the Grand Marshal of the Rose Bowl Parade?! 
25736,toby,(turns to face him) Huh? (eats something in his hand)
25737,toby,"I don't, uh, I don't know. (throws a pit hard into the garbage can)"
25738,toby,Yeah?
25739,leo,"Whitley left in the first van. He's there already. So somebody sit with the Boston Globe. (looks around, sees Donna) Donna, where's Josh?"
25741,josh,Come in. 
25743,josh,Yeah.
25745,josh,(exasperated) We're blowing this RU-486 thing. 
25747,josh,"Among everything else, it's gonna look like we're kicking off the campaign by pandering  to women's groups."
25749,josh,"Yeah, no question about it, most voters are pro-choice, but the ones that aren't are  gonna devote their lives and their money to beating you. ""Guns don't kill people;  Bartlet does."" It's gonna look like we screwed up the timing so the press is gonna  write about process and not about issues, and getting political reporters to write  about issues in the first place is like getting kids to eat their vegetables."
25751,josh,Don't you want to know how it's like getting kids to eat their vegetables?
25753,josh,(sighs and finally gets up) It helps if there's nothing else on their plate.
25755,josh,"(stops and turns to look at her) I know I could stop this thing! One phone call!  The President's not even involved! ""Could you do us a favor, could you hold off two  weeks? We love your drug but we don't want it folded into our news cycle! He's getting  more and more animated and distressed as he speaks. He's breathing heavily. I could have  picked up the phone, I could have picked up the phone, I could..."
25757,josh,(yelling) God!
25759,josh,"(sighs and pauses) I blew the tobacco thing... That could have helped us, and I was..."
25760,josh,This is gonna be a very close election.
25761,josh,I gotta take a shower.
25762,c.j.,Good morning.
25763,c.j.,Mr. President?
25764,bartlet,Come in.
25765,c.j.,I was told you wanted to see me. 
25766,bartlet,Yeah. Don't be a marriage counselor. It pisses me off. Okay?
25767,c.j.,I'm sorry? 
25768,bartlet,You know what I'm talking about. 
25769,c.j.,"Sir... She walks toward him, stopping just a few feet away."
25770,bartlet,That part of my life doesn't belong to you. 
25771,c.j.,"(sincerely) Sir, I was simply putting together what I thought was the best press event.  The First Lady is an excellent speaker and..."
25772,bartlet,All right. That's all. I'll see you out there. 
25773,c.j.,"Sir, I think if you get a bump in the polls after today's speech, as we expect you will,  I think it'd be a good time for me to resign. "
25774,bartlet,(looks up) Yeah?
25775,c.j.,"(nods) Well, to leave earlier would have been strategically..."
25776,bartlet,"Yeah, okay."
25777,c.j.,"(raising her voice) Look, the press is..."
25778,bartlet,"(sternly, raising his voice) That's nonsense to me and I don't care!"
25779,c.j.,"Well, you might not care..."
25780,bartlet,"(yelling, gesturing) For all the new jobs we've created, there are single mothers  working two of them at minimum wage. There are school districts where less than half  the students graduate. And a kid born in Harlem is more likely to go to prison than a  four-year college! They're bringing guns to school, C.J.!"
25781,c.j.,"(hurt, defiant) Don't you dare lecture me, Mr. President! Don't you dare do it!"
25782,bartlet,(gently) I was never supposed to win. 
25783,bartlet,I got in it polling in the single digits. Hoynes had it locked up. I got in it to give  some speeches and keep him honest...
25784,bartlet,...then you guys came along and all of a sudden I got 22% in Iowa and then South Carolina  and Michigan and... then Illinois.
25785,bartlet,(shakes his head) It was a mistake benching you for that last press conference. 
25786,bartlet,"(softly) I need you, too. "
25787,c.j.,"Thank you, Mr. President."
25788,bartlet,Did you know that hardly any of the guys who landed on the moon are married to the same  people they were married to before they went there?
25790,bartlet,I'm just saying it could be worse. I could've been an astronaut.
25792,bartlet,I'd have been a great astronaut.
25794,bartlet,I'd have overcome it to go to the moon.
25796,bartlet,(pauses to look at her) I'm really happy you're introducing me. I'm really happy about  that.Neither one of them says anything for a few moments.
25798,bartlet,Say it.
25800,sam,It means apathy.
25801,toby,And dullness.
25802,c.j.,Hey.
25803,c.j.,What's the word?
25804,josh,"(after taking a sip of water) ""Torpor."""
25805,c.j.,It means apathy.
25806,toby,And dullness.
25807,bartlet,They can look it up!
25808,bartlet,"It's not our job to appeal to the lowest common denominator, Doug. It's our job to raise  it. If you're going to be the ""Education President,"" it'd be nice not to hide that you  have an education."
25809,bartlet,"Bruno, would you mind?"
25810,bartlet,Churchill and FDR: serious men using big words for big purpose. 
25811,bartlet,"It occurs to me, I never said ""I'm sorry."" (pause) I am. (pause) For the lawyers, for the  press, for the mess, for the fear. Bruno, Doug, Connie: these guys are good. They want  to win. So do we. The only thing we want more is to be right. I wonder if you can't do  both. The staff are all standing very still, listening intently to his words. "
25812,bartlet,"There's a new book, and we're gonna write it. You can win if you run a smart, disciplined  campaign, if you studiously say nothing -- nothing that causes you trouble, nothing  that's a gaffe, nothing that shows you might think the wrong thing, nothing that shows  you think. But it just isn't worthy of us, is it, Toby? "
25813,toby,"No, sir."
25814,bartlet,"It isn't worthy of us, it isn't worthy of America, it isn't worthy of a great nation.  We're gonna write a new book, right here, right now. This very moment. Today. "
25815,bartlet,You know what? Break's over.
25817,josh,What’s going on?
25819,josh,Were you here all night?
25821,josh,It’s 7:30.
25823,josh,Yeah?
25825,josh,No.
25827,josh,Can I ask you something?
25829,josh,When you say in one of these boxes...
25831,josh,"Well, where is the piece of paper?  It’s... in one of these boxes."
25833,josh,You grew up in a condo.
25835,josh,"Hey, I’m not the one..."
25837,josh,"Yeah, me too."
25839,josh,Look...
25841,josh,"Hey, seriously, you need to sleep for a while."
25843,josh, I’ll be in the office.
25845,josh,I’ll do my best. 
25846,sam,Josh.
25847,josh,"Donna’s like two, three days from unspooling. It’s pretty fun to watch, but can you loan  me some senior assistants from Communications?"
25848,sam,"Yeah. So listen, there’s a fire in Yellowstone Park."
25849,josh,"Well, put it out."
25850,sam,"Technically, I’m not a professional firefighter, though there was a time I wanted to be."
25851,josh,When?
25852,sam,When I was four.
25853,josh,"When I was four, I wanted to be a ballerina."
25854,sam,Yeah?
25855,josh,I don’t like to... talk about it.
25856,sam,There was a dry lightning strike in a lodgepole pine forest. Fire spread to 500 acres but  it’s all inside the resource benefit zone.
25857,josh,Is it all under control?
25858,sam,"Well, as a matter of fact, last night the park’s superintendent - in consultation with  Bill Horton and several deputies from the Department of the Interior decided to let it  run its course."
25859,josh,They’re letting it burn?
25860,sam,It’s not necessarily our policy to put these things out.
25861,josh,Putting out fires isn’t necessarily our policy?
25862,sam,Fire’s good for the environment under certain circumstances. Forests have a natural cycle  that requires purging burns to reinvigorate growth.
25863,josh," Someone just said that to you, right?"
25864,sam,Yeah.
25865,josh,What do we need to do?
25866,sam,The President needs to talk on the phone with the governor.
25867,josh,Why?
25868,sam,So that the President can say he talked on the phone with the governor.
25869,josh,I’ll take care of it.
25870,sam,Ballerina?
25871,josh,I’d kind of like that not to get around. 
25872,sam,"Yeah, fat chance of that. "
25873,c.j.,How is it not like being served?
25874,c.j.,"Yeah, but isn’t it like the way a mugger uses a gun to produce your wallet?"
25875,c.j.,"Oliver, political reporters don’t care about the scope of the inquiry; they hear  ‘subpoenas’..."
25876,c.j.,My trouble with your spin is that we’re not going to get anywhere putting on a calm face.  We need to pick a fight!
25877,c.j.,"Because in politics, if you’re not on offense, you’re on defense."
25878,c.j.,Let me think for just a second.  What do Republicans say about him?
25879,c.j.,What do they say about him?
25880,c.j.,Excuse me! 
25881,c.j.,We need a different enemy. 
25882,leo,When are you going to meet on the estate tax?
25883,josh,Five minutes.
25884,leo,With Toby?
25885,josh,Yeah.
25886,leo,"Just remember it’s a compromise, Josh, it’s done. You may not like it, but..."
25887,josh,It’s a compromise.
25888,leo," I’m saying the two of you, when you don’t like something, have a  tendency to..."
25889,josh,Show our displeasure?
25890,leo,Piss people off!
25891,josh,That’s a bad rep. I’m sweet as pecan pie.
25892,leo, Yeah?
25893,josh,"I hate these people, Leo. And when this thing is done, I’m going to personally screw them  with their pants on!"
25894,c.j., Excuse me.
25895,leo,"Hey, C.J.."
25896,c.j.,Leo.  Giselle.
25897,josh,"Yeah, I’m outta here. "
25898,c.j.,You have a second?
25899,leo,Yeah. Walk with me.
25900,c.j.,Oliver Babish and Ainsley Hayes were just in my office.
25901,leo,On spin?
25902,c.j.,Yeah.
25903,leo,What have you got?
25904,c.j.,Nothing. You know why?
25905,leo,Rollins likes us. 
25906,c.j.,I don’t know if he likes us but he doesn’t hate us.
25907,leo,"Well, that’s just because he doesn’t know us."
25908,c.j.,"Leo, we need to be investigated by someone who wants to kill us just to watch us die.  We need someone perceived by the American people to be irresponsible, untrustworthy,  partisan, ambitious and thirsty for the limelight. Am I crazy or is this not a job for  the U.S. House of Representatives?"
25909,leo,"Well, they’ll get around to it sooner or later."
25910,c.j.,"So let’s make it sooner. Let’s make it now. Rollins is driving them slow, he won’t talk  to the press, they’re ready to jump ... I swear to god, Leo, I think we can move the show!"
25911,leo, You got a briefing now?
25912,c.j.,Yeah.
25913,leo,Show me what you’re starting with.
25914,c.j.,Yeah.
25915,toby,I’m leaving now!
25916,toby,I’m leaving for this meeting.
25917,toby,This meeting when I will compromise!
25918,toby,"Yes, I do. Why do we compromise?  Because we are ordered to, because  compromising on the estate tax prevents Republicans from going for an even bigger  tax cut which would help rest the White House from our compromising little hands...  so I go to this meeting..."
25919,toby,"The estate tax which Republicans have cleverly dubbed the Death Tax there’s nothing  that... heh, the Republicans do better than naming things... So I go to this meeting...   So I go to this meeting..."
25920,toby,"Oh, I go to this meeting, Ginger, and though I compromise, I draw a line in the sand,  I’m there to insure that only multi-millionaires and not billionaires are exempt from  the estate tax."
25921,toby," Reelect the President, Bonnie. He’s on the side of millionaires and not  billionaires!"
25922,toby, What do you mean?
25923,josh,They cancelled the meeting.
25924,toby,Bonnie’s got them on the phone; what’s going on?
25925,josh,They say it’s his daughter’s wedding.
25926,toby,His daughter’s wedding is on Saturday.
25927,josh,They say he wants to leave early.
25928,toby,They’re lying.
25929,josh, I know.
25930,toby, What’s going on?
25931,josh, I think they want to take it off the table.
25932,toby,And do what?
25933,josh,The White House is weak. What would you do?
25934,toby,You think they want to repeal the estate tax? 
25935,c.j.,Good morning!
25936,c.j.,"No, in fact we’ve already sent over 80 cartons of documents to Clem.  I’m sorry,  to Mr. Rollins. Eighty cartons of documents that weren’t even subpoenaed and we intend to  continue cooperating with him fully. Bobbi?"
25937,c.j.,They’re a commonly used legal tool to define the scope of the inquiry. Steve?
25938,c.j.,"Well, obviously we don’t think they’re necessary, but that’s not for us to say..."
25939,c.j.,... and we take a different view than Congressional Republicans do of this Special  Prosecutor’s performance thus far: we believe he’s running a thorough and impartial  investigation and he should be allowed to finish his work.
25940,c.j.,You’d have to ask Congress that. Mark?
25941,leo, Calls?
25942,leo,This estate tax repeal out of committee is gonna be a thing.
25943,leo,"Bruno, they cancelled the meeting yesterday! We think the House Republicans are going to  try to repeal the estate tax."
25944,leo,Really?
25945,leo, Who won?
25946,leo,"Well, now the repeal of the estate tax seems somehow insignificant."
25947,leo,Yeah.
25948,leo, Yeah.
25949,leo,No.
25950,leo,Campos took some courtside seats.
25951,leo,He loves the President. He got the California primary for him!
25952,leo,Because they went to a basketball game?
25953,leo,Yes.
25954,leo,Yes.
25955,leo,And we gave him a seat on it.
25956,leo,When?
25957,leo,"...the game ended in double overtime! Ah, dammit! Margaret! "
25958,sam, Yeah. Okay. 
25959,sam, The fire’s in 1500 acres.
25960,leo,"Sam. Victor Campos had a meeting last night with Jack Buckland, then he passed on the  Community Empowerment Board."
25961,sam,Really?
25962,leo,Yeah. What do you think he’s doing? 
25963,sam,Can you set up a meeting for me?
25964,leo,Yeah.
25965,leo,At the meeting?
25966,leo,Why?
25967,leo,Sam can do this.
25968,leo,Sam will have the meeting and report back.
25969,leo,Sam does this for us.
25970,leo,Oftentimes.
25971,sam,"You guys know I’m sitting right here, right?"
25972,leo,We’re gonna set up a meeting 
25973,sam,Right. And we might want to think about putting this fire out!
25989,c.j.,I was just coming to see you.
25990,c.j.,I'm putting you on Capital Beat tonight.
25991,c.j.,"""Clem Rollins is running ..."" Listen to me. ""Clem Rollins is running a thorough, fair,  and impartial investigation, he's a man of great integrity."""
25992,c.j.,"""We're eager to cooperate with the Special Prosecutor."" Don't oversell it."
25993,c.j.,They're going to introduce racial profiling. 15-minute op in the Rose Garden. 
25994,c.j.,Senate hearings on trade agreements between the US and Brazil. Campos can discuss his  objections to the President’s position.
25995,c.j.,"I don’t... Hey, you know what? The unveiling of the HELP initiative."
25996,c.j.,Hispanic Education Longevity Program. It lowers the dropout rate for Latino high school  students. 
25997,c.j.,"In fact, I do. "
25998,c.j.,Good morning!
25999,c.j.,"Before I forget Victor Campos has been added to the guest list for the unveiling of the  Hispanic Education Longevity Program. That’s Thursday, day after tomorrow. Mark?"
26000,c.j.,I can tell you that Oliver Babish and Mr Rollins had several productive conversations  about that.
26001,c.j.,"Well, they’re old friends."
26002,toby, It wasn’t reasonable.
26003,toby,It wasn’t in driving distance of reasonable.
26004,toby,Don’t say it...
26005,toby,98% of estates pay no taxes at all. We’re talking about people who are loaded!
26006,toby,"I think if we’re going to spend millions of dollars on tax breaks, we should consider  spending it on people who don’t have millions of dollars."
26007,toby,And they don’t make good yachts anymore.  What’d they say?
26008,josh,The... meeting is not going to be rescheduled.
26009,toby,How do they know?
26010,josh,Legislative Affairs has it from three rural House Democrats that Ways and Means is  trolling for votes.
26011,toby,On a complete repeal?
26012,josh,Yeah.
26013,toby," Screw it. We went from a million to two-five, what if we throw in another..."
26014,josh,No.
26015,toby,I’m saying... Maybe we expand the compromise...
26016,josh,They’re not going to reschedule the meeting!
26017,toby,"Well, how do we know until we... "
26018,josh,The meeting is not going to be rescheduled.  What do you think?
26019,toby,"I can tell you what he thinks. He thinks we roll with it. He thinks a president can’t be  against tax cuts in an election year, he thinks since our key districts have farms that  are going to be inherited, we have to... He thinks we roll with it."
26020,josh," Toby, I just... don’t know on how many fronts we can fight a war. You want to find out?"
26021,toby,Yeah.
26022,c.j.,About what?
26023,c.j.,And there’s concern on the Hill?
26024,c.j.,Yeah.
26025,c.j.,"You, too."
26026,c.j.,How’d the call with the Governor go?
26027,sam,It didn’t go that well.
26028,c.j.,Why not?
26029,sam,He’s demanding we put the fire out. The President tried to calm him down but he kept  accusing us of advocating fringe environmental policies.
26030,c.j.,Are we?
26031,sam,"It’s not clear. But, for the moment, the President and Governor had a productive  conversation, he’s monitoring the situation with the Secretary of the Interior."
26032,sam,Hey!
26033,sam,Shouldn’t you be someplace keeping me out of jail?
26034,sam,Okay. 
26035,c.j.,You did well last night on Capital Beat. 
26036,c.j.,Babish and Rollins wrote a paper together for the Yale Law Review.
26037,c.j.,"Yeah, the problem is I can’t just make photocopies and distribute it."
26038,c.j.,I want you to get with one of your friends in the pressroom from a conservative paper. 
26039,c.j.,Do you?
26040,c.j.,"Get alone with one of those guys, go off record, and say you can’t believe how the  President can be claiming to waive Executive Privileges yet still reserve the right to  withhold certain documents. Can you do that?"
26041,c.j.,"Yeah, do it quietly and kind of shake your head in disbelief."
26042,c.j.," You don’t have to keep shaking your head, just a little in the beginning."
26043,c.j.,"Yeah, but think about..."
26044,c.j.,Thank you.
26045,bartlet,Charlie!
26046,bartlet,Are we out of pens? 
26047,bartlet,"That’s a good pen, I need an everyday pen."
26048,bartlet,"You’ve got crappy pens, with a plastic top. I need a solid pen that feels good in my  hand, but it’s not so formal I feel like a dandy."
26049,bartlet,"I used to have the perfect pens. Every day right here, in my pocket. I loved those pens!  Balance, great action, paper soaked up the ink what the hell happened to those pens? Do  they not make them anymore? I kept that company in business."
26050,bartlet,"You know, I just haven’t gotten to it."
26051,bartlet,It’s just been busy.
26052,bartlet,Is there a rush on this? 
26053,bartlet,"I have five secretaries, to say nothing of the Secretaries of State, Defense, Treasury,  and Education."
26054,bartlet,Yeah?
26055,bartlet,"Things have been fine. I’m gonna have dinner and I’ll be back in the office after, okay?"
26056,bartlet,Are you having dinner?
26057,bartlet,I’ll see you later 
26058,bartlet, Yeah.
26059,sam,"Good, how about you?"
26060,sam,Yeah?
26061,sam,Yeah?
26062,sam,No.
26063,sam,Yeah.
26064,sam,But?
26065,sam, Yeah.
26066,sam,"Hey, you weren’t kidding about that exceptional mind."
26067,sam,"England’s in Europe, right?"
26068,sam,Yeah.
26069,sam,"A democrat can’t get elected to anything in California without him. He can pick up the  phone and have 5,000 people at your rally in an hour. He’s got a state-of-the art vote  mobilizing operation in place, a massive room with computer banks tracking voter  registration. With his endorsement comes 350 thousand calls, callbacks, mailings and  e-mails."
26078,c.j.,"Well, Executive Privilege protects all communications that are necessary to enable a  President to do his job, but as I said the President’s waiving Executive Privilege. Mark?"
26079,c.j.,"Actually, he's trying to protect the office of the presidency. Information pertaining to  national security, for instance."
26080,c.j.,I was born this way.
26081,c.j.,"I think if you want to know what Clement Rollins thinks, you should read some of his  writings on the subject. He was a University of Chicago Law School professor and I'm not  sure, you can check me on this but I think he was editor of the Yale Law Review. "
26082,c.j.,"That's a full lid, everybody, have a good night. "
26083,c.j.,Is he mad at us?
26084,c.j.,"Good irate, or..."
26085,c.j.,All right. Circulate a memo to anyone who's going to see a microphone. 
26086,c.j.,"The National Fire Plan is based on Recommendations from five Federal agencies. It clearly  states that 80 years of fire suppression hasn't worked; for centuries, wildfires have  been a natural part of the evolution of the forest ecosystems."
26087,c.j.,That's the kind of thing they shouldn't say. Put that in the memo with a circle and a  line through it.
26088,c.j.,Oliver.
26089,c.j.,I'll say.
26090,c.j.,About an hour. They'll make their deadlines.
26091,c.j.,Yeah?
26092,c.j.,Yeah.
26093,c.j.,Is that what you were wondering?
26094,c.j.,Anything else?
26095,josh,We spent the last few hours with the Minority whip and some deputies. 
26096,leo,They have the votes for a repeal?
26097,josh,They have 218 without breaking a sweat.
26098,toby, It's 290 to override.
26099,leo,Where are they getting them?
26100,josh,"The Republicans are calling an 'all-hands,' we're assuming they'll get the full 226 plus  Fayette, Genesee and Trent. California..."
26101,toby,A state I begged you to let secede from the Union.
26102,josh,"The... entire California delegation wants a compromise. If they don't get one, they vote  to repeal."
26103,toby,We lose about another 13 votes from rural districts. Maybe 3 of them will switch back to  us if it was close but they'd get killed next November and I wouldn’t ask them to do it.
26104,leo,That's 283. Where are the other 7 votes against us?
26105,josh,That's the thing.
26106,toby,It's from inside the Black Caucus. That's where the 7 votes are.
26107,leo,I want you two to see Mark Richardson first thing in the morning.
26108,josh,We already set it up.
26109,leo,"When you're done, we'll make a recommendation to the President, he'll make his decision  to fight or live to fight and that'll be that. "
26110,josh,These are members of the Congressional Black Caucus... can you think of any reason why  they'd oppose the estate tax?
26111,leo,Sure.
26112,josh,What?
26113,leo,First generation of black millionnaires is about to die.
26114,leo,Is he back?
26115,leo,Thanks. 
26116,bartlet,Charlie.
26117,bartlet,I'm expecting a call from Bill Horton and I left the National Fire Plan in the dining  room.
26118,bartlet,Thanks. 
26119,leo,Good evening.
26120,bartlet,The governor of Wyoming was an inch an a half away from calling me a pyromaniac tonight.
26121,leo,That's surprising 'cause we really had respect from him before.
26122,bartlet,"I'm saying somewhere out there is a registered voter who's thinking, 'You know, I thought  I really liked this Bartlet fellow, but now that I see he's in favor of fire...'"
26123,leo,He thinks it's gonna adversely affect tourism.
26124,bartlet,It's the end of the season and the fire isn't anywhere near tourists. Letting this fire  burn is good for the environment. You know how I know?
26125,leo,How?
26126,bartlet,"Because smart people told me. Please god, Leo, let them be right."
26127,leo,When are you talking to Horton?
26128,bartlet,Any minute.
26129,leo,You want me to handle the call?
26130,bartlet,Yeah.
26131,leo,I'll be in my office.
26151,sam,"Victor, I was wondering why you passed on the Commission?"
26152,sam,And you didn't go to Indiana to watch a basketball game.
26153,sam,Don't get cute with me.
26154,sam,"No, I don't think I will, Victor. We fought a war together. What the hell happened to  loyalty?"
26155,sam,"You know what? The President promised to ban permanent striker replacement workers, and  he did it."
26156,sam,"Who else was talking about prenatal care for illegal immigrants in Davenport, Iowa?"
26157,sam,He put an empowerment zone in Pacoima and no one has worked harder to raise the minimum  wage.
26158,sam,"¡Te subió al podio en la maldita convención, Victor!   "
26159,sam,¡Estas equivocado!  
26160,sam,"The lowest Latino unemployment in history, more small business loans for Hispanic  entrepreneurs, and the biggest drop in Latino poverty in two decades!"
26161,sam, What happened to loyalty?
26162,sam,What do you want?
26163,sam,We’re gonna double the funding for the National High School Initiative. What else?
26164,sam,There's gonna be a major push on the Hispanic Children's Health Act.
26165,sam,He’s gonna mention it in the State of the Union. What else?
26166,sam, No way.
26167,sam,Victor...
26168,sam,Look...
26169,sam,We can't back a bill that treats Hispanic immigrants any differently than...
26170,sam,There's no way we can do it.
26171,sam, I'm sorry?
26172,sam,We really can't.
26173,sam, Would you excuse us just a second?
26174,sam,"When I said, ""Stay out of my way,"" did you think I meant..."
26175,sam,Just so he can expand his union membership?
26176,sam,He’s giving me a hard time.
26177,sam,Victor. 
26178,sam,What do we get?
26179,sam,"If I take this to the President, what do we get?"
26180,sam,I shouldn't have blown up at you before.
26181,sam,Yeah?
26182,josh,"Surely, Congressman, the African-American community can think of better ways to spend  twenty-eight billion dollars than a tax break that’ll benefit fewer than a thousand  African-American families. "
26183,josh,Mark...
26184,josh,That was pretty surprising. 
26185,josh,You think a few black millionaires justifies a multi-billion-dollar boondoggle?
26186,toby,"We're bleeding here, Mark."
26187,toby,"We're bleeding here, for God's sake. You can work with us or you can be ignored by a  Republican President, but those are your choices."
26188,toby,Buckland's coming after us. He’s been meeting with Victor Campos. 
26189,toby,"Who are you talking to, Mark? We're not gonna forget about failing schools in central  cities.  We're not gonna forget  about after-school care, health care for uninsured kids. We're not gonna forget about  drug treatment, or urban redevelopment, or community policing!"
26190,toby,You gotta not forget that we're bleeding!
26191,josh,The veto's an awfully big risk to take... if you can't promise anything.
26192,leo,Has the fire abated at all?
26193,leo,How far has it spread?
26194,bartlet,So it's starting to close in on the boundary?
26195,leo,Do you think he should?
26196,leo,Why?
26197,leo,"And if it doesn't, we put it out, and the President looks like an idiot for waiting this  long."
26198,bartlet," Yeah, but we're gonna make sure he looks  like an idiot, too, right?"
26199,leo,Yeah.
26200,bartlet, Wyoming is just going to have to have some faith that the Department  of the Interior knows what it’s doing.
26201,bartlet,"Thank you, Mr. Secretary."
26202,bartlet,Josh.
26203,josh,"Yes, sir?"
26204,bartlet,A ballerina? 
26205,josh,"Yeah, I... I didn't... know... what it was at the time. I-I-I liked the word..."
26206,bartlet,We'll go with that for now.
26207,toby,"Mr. President, we’re here to recommend that you threaten to veto any repeal of the  estate tax."
26208,bartlet, Really?
26209,toby,"Yes, sir."
26210,leo,What happened with Richardson?
26211,josh,No guarantees. He wants to see what we’re gonna do next.
26212,toby,Let's make the threat.
26213,bartlet, You like this?
26214,bartlet,I thought you don't oppose a tax cut in an election year?
26215,bartlet, I’ll say.
26216,josh, You sign it. You don't do it with a stamp.
26217,bartlet,"Actually, you stamp it, then sign it."
26218,toby,"Who gives a damn, sir? This is a tax cut that benefits only 4500 families."
26219,bartlet,"It doesn't matter if most voters don't benefit. They all believe that someday they will.  That's the problem with the American dream. It makes everyone concerned for the day  they're gonna be rich... The governors of Wyoming, Idaho, Montana, and Utah, along with  the Senate Majority Leader and Speaker of the House, are calling me a ""fringe""  environmentalist, 'cause I'm listening to the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary  of Agriculture, along with the U.S. Forest Service, the Chief Ranger, and the Parks  Superintendent."
26220,bartlet,"They say letting the fire burn is good for the environment. And I'm betting on a weather  report, of all things. It's just one of those times."
26221,c.j.,"You don’t have a bottle opener, do you?"
26222,c.j.,I know some men carry those... 
26223,c.j.,...pocket knives. 
26224,c.j.,I worked the press.
26225,c.j.,You think I care less about irony?
26226,c.j., Anybody have a bottle opener?
26228,josh, Yeah?
26230,josh,For the hearings? 
26232,josh,"You’d think so, but Thomas's committee wanted it, so the Majority Leader..."
26234,josh,House Government Reform and Oversight.
26235,sam,Volume!
26236,c.j., Come and get us.
26238,josh,'Cause it's not the same.
26240,josh,"At the end of the night, you want to be able to pull it open, like Tony Bennett."
26242,josh,He's also shorter than I am.
26244,josh, I was gonna do it before the entree.
26246,josh,Why?
26248,josh,Is there etiquette for this?
26250,josh,Then why are you bothering me?
26252,josh,My phone's ringing.
26254,josh,You want to answer it?
26256,josh,Donna?
26258,josh,Call around.
26259,c.j.,Quiz me.
26260,toby,I don't think I will.
26261,c.j.,Quiz me.
26262,toby,You're a lively conversationalist. You won't have any problem getting...
26263,c.j.,Quiz me.
26264,toby,Who are you sitting next to?
26265,c.j.,"Dr. Kary B. Mullis, recipient of the 1993 Nobel Prize for chemistry. Born 1944, North Carolina.  He earned his Bachelor's Degree from Georgia Tech and his PhD. in biochemistry from my alma mater,  U.C. Berkeley."
26266,toby,"If all he wants to talk about is where he's from, where he went to school, and what his name is,  you'll be fine."
26267,toby,It's here?
26268,toby,Uh...
26269,c.j.,(to Toby) I'll meet you there.
26270,sam,Toby?
26271,toby,"Uh, it's here."
26272,sam,"Yeah, I know. Listen. The Social Office called."
26273,toby,And?
26274,sam,They said the Republicans who RSVP'd for the dinner aren't gonna show up.
26275,toby,We knew that might happen.
26276,sam,"Well, it happened. You think we should..."
26277,toby,What? Put it off?
26278,sam,Yeah.
26279,toby,I know.
26280,sam,I'm saying...
26281,toby,The President said he was gonna veto the bill. C.J. announced he was gonna veto the bill.  He's gonna veto the bill.
26282,bartlet,There was a reason they had to cancel.
26283,leo,There's an emergency meeting of the Republican Leadership.
26284,bartlet,What do you think they're gonna be talking about?
26285,leo,I think they're planning a surprise party.
26286,bartlet,They could have left after the entree.
26287,leo,Yeah.
26288,bartlet,They're gonna miss hot pumpkin soup with a cheese gnocchi and a chevre brioche.
26289,leo,Yeah.
26290,bartlet,That's a pretty big price to pay just to override my veto.
26291,leo,Maybe they think they've got the vote.
26292,bartlet,What are you saying?
26293,leo,Maybe something shifted in the last couple of hours.
26294,bartlet,Leo...
26295,leo,They just sent the bill out five minutes ago. They know you're gonna veto. Why schedule an override  vote right now?
26296,bartlet,So I'd think twice about vetoing.
26297,leo,"Well, that's what I thought too."
26298,bartlet,And now?
26299,josh,"Good evening, Mr. President."
26300,bartlet,Where is this thing?
26301,josh,It's on its way.
26302,bartlet,You know what we're starting with tonight?
26303,josh,"No, sir."
26304,bartlet,Hot pumpkin soup with a cheese gnocchi and a chevre brioche.
26305,josh,Was anything you just said food?
26306,toby,"Good evening, Mr. President."
26307,sam,"Good evening, sir."
26308,bartlet,It's on its way.
26309,sam,"Sir, the Social Office..."
26310,leo,We know.
26311,sam,Seven Republicans who RSVP'd for the dinner...
26312,leo,We know.
26313,sam,You know that there's an emergency meeting of the Republican Leadership?
26314,leo,Yeah.
26315,bartlet,I say they could've waited until after the entree.
26316,josh,Maybe they didn't know about the chevre brioche.
26317,sam,Does anyone want to consider waiting?
26318,toby,No.
26319,sam,The Constitution gives them ten days.
26320,toby,I'm familiar with it.
26321,sam,So why don't we...?
26322,toby,"'Cause if it's a show of strength and resolve, you don't wait to think about it."
26323,sam,"And if they override the veto, it's neither strong nor resolute."
26324,toby,They don't have the votes to override.
26325,sam,Says you.
26326,toby,"Says me, Josh, the office of the Political Liaison, Legislative Liaison, and the Minority Whip."
26327,bartlet,Sometimes it's like I don't even need to be here.
26328,c.j.,"Good evening, Mr. President."
26329,bartlet,"C.J., you look very nice."
26330,c.j.,"Thank you, sir. Is it here?"
26331,leo,It's on its way.The room falls silent for a minute.
26332,c.j.,I've been seated next to a chemist tonight.
26333,bartlet,Mullis?
26334,c.j.,"Twenty-three Nobel Prize winners in the East Room, I couldn't get literature, or I don't know,  peace or something?"
26335,leo, What's her problem?
26336,toby,"She thinks she won't be able to make conversation with the guy, but she's wrong 'cause she knows  what year he was born and his name."
26337,c.j.,"You got to be a cryptographer. They speak in combinations of letters that don't spell anything,  but end up meaning table salt."
26338,bartlet,Is it here?
26339,bartlet,Okay.
26340,bartlet,Hey.
26341,bartlet,What's your name?
26342,sam,"Leo, I don't think it's a bluff. I don't think the Congressional Leadership holds their members  back on a weekend for a bluff."
26343,leo,"I don't think they're bluffing, Sam."
26344,toby,You think they're holding an override vote tonight?
26345,leo,I'm sure of it.
26346,toby,Why would they hold a vote if they didn't think they could override?
26347,bartlet,"They wouldn't. What do you got in the box, Mr. Dolan?"
26348,toby,Excuse me.
26349,toby,"Leo, you think we lost some votes we don't know about?"
26350,leo,I think we're about to find out.
26351,josh,"Sir, if the House successfully overrides the veto, we're gonna look weak."
26352,bartlet,"If the House successfully overrides the veto, we are weak."
26353,bartlet,"NaCl, C.J."
26354,c.j.,"I'm sorry, sir?"
26355,bartlet,Table salt.  Send it back.
26356,c.j.,"The clerk of the House presented the executive clerk with HR10, a bill repealing the estate tax,  which our opponents sometimes call the Death Tax, or the We're Coming to Get Your Children tax.   Katie?"
26357,c.j.,We don't know. Phil?
26358,c.j.,Nope.
26359,c.j.,You'd have to ask them.
26360,c.j.,Yeah.
26361,c.j.,It's a dress.
26362,c.j.,"Diane Cook. Anything else? Okay, I'll be in for periodic briefings and we'll try not to keep you  too late.  What's Sherri Wexler doing here?"
26363,c.j.,She's an entertainment reporter.
26364,c.j.,"Yeah, but now she's going to cover a veto override in the House and I'm saying this is a girl who  barely covers an Easter Egg hunt."
26365,c.j.,"Ah, I've got to get back to dinner. Do you happen to have a copy of the Periodic Table of Elements?"
26366,c.j.,Okay.
26367,sam, Toby!
26368,toby,What did...?
26369,sam,That was the Minority Leader's office. They've scheduled a vote.
26370,toby,When?
26371,sam,"Ninety minutes. An hour to debate, then 20 minutes to vote."
26372,toby,What do they think?
26373,sam,They think they must be down. How did we lose votes since yesterday?
26374,toby,A low-in-the-polls president tells the chicken-ass Democrats to vote against a tax cut in an election  cycle. What could possibly have gone wrong? Ginger!
26375,toby,We're going to need ten phone lines in the Roosevelt room and some bodies from Legislative affairs!
26376,sam,We need a whip count.
26377,toby,The old whip count doesn't do us any good. We need a new one.
26378,sam,That's going to take a while.
26379,toby,They're all sitting there. Tell them to raise their hands.
26380,sam,Bonnie!
26381,sam,"Any Democratic members who've headed for National, get them back. Page Delta, United American.  Nobody gets on a plane."
26382,sam,Straight up or down.
26383,sam,They start the debate in 90 minutes and vote an hour after that.
26384,toby," Ginger, the phones, the bodies, and keep an open line to the Whip's office!"
26385,toby,And get Leo out of the dinner!
26386,sam,Excuse me.  Charlie?
26387,sam,How's the dinner going?
26388,sam,"You and I should talk, you know."
26389,sam,The committee's going to offer you a chance to give a proffer.
26390,sam,I know they are.
26391,sam,"You know what it is, right?"
26392,sam,Yeah.
26394,sam,We're waiting for a new whip count. Listen... how ready is he on the environment?
26396,sam,I don't think I'll be able to get in there with him.
26398,sam,"Yeah, I've got this in here. "
26400,sam,When is he doing it?
26402,sam,"He needs to look at the latest EPA stats on child asthma, all right? Tell him!"
26404,sam, What's going on?
26405,sam,"If it was Kimball, he'd have taken half of his committee with him."
26406,sam,Newhouse I don't believe. Illinois 17 is safe. He doesn't want anything
26407,leo,What's happening?
26408,sam,"There's a vote scheduled. We don't' have the count. I don't think it's Newhouse, I don't think  it's Kimball."
26409,toby, It's Kimball.
26410,sam,"I'm telling you, if it was Kimball, we'd have six..."
26411,toby,It's Kimball on the phone right now.
26412,josh,Donna?
26414,josh,My tie's falling apart.
26416,josh,It's not going to be...
26418,josh,Tony Bennett.
26420,josh,Yeah.
26422,josh,I'll be all right.
26424,josh,I got them.
26426,josh,I gotta get back to dinner. Can it wait a little bit?
26428,josh, How's it look?
26430,sam,Maybe he wants the compromise back on the table.
26431,toby,He doesn't want to compromise.
26432,sam,He was ready to settle for a 10 million-dollar exemption instead of a 5 million.
26433,toby,Compromising with a 10 million-dollar exemption - here's a conversation my father never had.
26434,leo,Yeah?
26435,leo,What's going on?
26436,leo,What's going on?
26437,leo,How bad is it?
26438,leo, All right. 
26439,leo,"Margaret, I'll be in the Situation Room."
26440,leo,Did this guy have a car strapped to his chest? 
26441,bartlet, Have the parents been notified? 
26442,bartlet,Has anyone claimed responsibility? 
26443,leo,Not yet. 
26444,bartlet,"Nancy, hasn't State issued travel warnings since Bekaa? "
26445,bartlet,The Americans were targeted? 
26446,bartlet,We know this? 
26447,leo,"And, Mr. President? "
26448,bartlet,Yeah? 
26449,leo,They think they've found traces of C-4. 
26450,bartlet,You think there's an Afghan connection? 
26451,leo,Or even Iran. 
26452,bartlet,How long? 
26453,bartlet,I'm going to want some temperature-cooling options. 
26454,c.j.,"""Na"" is sodium. Sodium comes from the english word ""soda"" so wouldn't it make sense for the periodic  symbol to be somehow related to that? No, because ""na"" comes from the latin word ""natrium."" "
26455,c.j.,"It means ""sodium."" "
26456,leo, Come on in. 
26457,c.j.,I'm pretty well briefed. 
26458,leo,Is it on the news yet? 
26459,c.j.,Yeah 
26460,leo,They were brothers. 
26461,c.j.,What were they doing there? 
26462,leo,A soccer match. 
26463,c.j.,Can we say whether or not we think they were intentional targets? 
26464,leo,"Not yet, and we can't release their names. "
26465,c.j.,The Levys just lost their sons. I'll take the heat for a few hours. The President'll call them? 
26466,leo,Yeah. 
26467,c.j.,Can I tell them the President's been in touch with the Prime Minister? 
26468,leo,"Yeah, but don't give them a read. The Israelis are going to do what they're going to do so ratchet  down expectations. "
26469,c.j.,Anything else? 
26470,leo,No. 
26471,c.j.,I'm going to get in there. 
26472,leo,Thank you.
26473,c.j.,Charlie? 
26474,c.j.,"Listen, I wanted to... "
26475,c.j.,"Word is, you're- "
26476,c.j.,"We'll talk hypothetically. Say a guy your age was offered a ""get out of jail free"" card. "
26477,c.j.,But everybody's getting called and everybody's getting lawyers and if you took immunity- 
26478,c.j.,"For a few hours, not 100 hours. "
26479,c.j.,I know what you're thinking. 
26480,c.j.,Okay. I'm going to change my clothes. 
26481,josh,What the hell's going on? 
26482,sam,We're down four votes. 
26483,josh,I thought it was one. 
26484,sam,"Three of our guys are on airplanes, and out of reach. "
26485,josh,Why? 
26486,sam,That's where they wanted to be. 
26487,josh,Where's Kimball? 
26488,sam,He's on his way. Toby's waiting for him. 
26490,josh,Is he in there? 
26492,josh,I got to go. 
26493,sam,Did you look at the child asthma stats? 
26494,josh,Yeah.
26495,josh,Governor. 
26496,josh,Sorry to interrupt dinner. 
26497,josh,"I do. Good to see you guys. Anybody need a drink, or anything?"
26498,josh,"Thanks, Donna. So, Governor, the president's a tree-hugger? "
26499,josh,"""If you want to save a spotted owl Vote for Bartlet, If you want to save a job, Vote for someone else""? "
26500,josh,"No, she did, in the Indianapolis Post-Dispatch. You weren't misquoted, right? "
26501,josh,"Okay, listen. I wouldn't know a spotted owl if he walked up and introduced himself but I do know  the president's a pro-business pragmatist who has created 3.8 million new jobs."
26502,josh,The decline in manufacturing isn't because of the environment. 
26503,josh,Jonathan... 
26504,josh,"You want to see a study that says if we hadn't passed the Clean Air Act two million more people  would have suffered from heart disease, bronchitis, respiratory- "
26505,josh,The EPA stats on child asthma alone- 
26506,josh,"It doesn't destroy jobs, Jack, it creates them. There's a $400 billion worldwide market in  creating technologies that are environmentally safe. "
26507,josh,You invited Victor Campos to Indiana. 
26508,josh,Pam's quote in the Post-Dispatch...
26509,josh,"Jack, are you going to challenge the president in the primary? "
26510,toby,Took you long enough. 
26511,toby,And I'm not about to be. 
26512,toby,We can win this without you. 
26513,toby,"How does a Democrat from Tennessee Farm Country, where we championed electrification -- the  Tennessee Valley Authority, farm safety nets, the... how do you do this to a democratic president? "
26514,toby,That's not my point. 
26515,toby,That's not my point. 
26516,toby,You were with us yesterday and now you're holding us hostage. 
26517,toby,Grazing fees? 
26518,toby,Grazing fees. Let's go; we're running out of time.
26519,c.j.,I can't confirm the names of any Americans killed. Arthur? 
26520,c.j.,"The parties themselves negotiated the terms of the cease fire, and the government of the United  States remains committed to the peace process. "
26521,c.j.,"I like to call on people, Sherri."
26522,c.j.,"Well, as I said earlier we can't confirm or deny the identities of any American victims of the  bombing. "
26523,c.j.,I think the citizens of Dallas will understand that the 1974 Privacy Act precludes me from  discussing those details until the family gives its consent. Mark? 
26524,c.j.,"We're still investigating the circumstances. In the meantime, we continue to urge all parties to  demonstrate restraint. Phil."
26525,leo,It was a Palestinian splinter group called the Palestine Freedom Front. 
26526,bartlet,Agency and FBI concur? 
26527,leo,Yeah. 
26528,bartlet,And we shouldn't be looking outside the box? 
26529,leo,Hutchinson talked with the Israeli foreign minister and the interior minister. It was an isolated  incident. 
26530,bartlet,Retaliation for Bekaa? 
26531,leo,Yeah. 
26532,bartlet,If that's the case I want to hear it from Arafat's mouth. I want to hear it from him. A denunciation  of violence. I want to see security cooperation with the Israelis. 
26533,leo,"We'll have the U.N. Secretary general put the screws to the chairman and Scorza can be at the prime  minister's office. Maybe, maybe, maybe we can get Israel to hold their fire tonight. "
26534,bartlet,Would you? 
26535,leo,No.
26536,sam,"Yes, and they do it for about one-tenth of market value. "
26537,sam,Based on an archaic formula set by Congress 30 years ago. 
26538,sam,"We're not trying to stick it to ranchers. We want to raise grazing fees and use the money to restore  streams, watersheds- "
26539,sam,--Fish and wildlife habitats that have been destroyed by over-
26540,sam,It's cheaper for cattle to graze on federal lands than to feed a young basset hound. 
26541,toby,I don't want to look at the range land anymore. A one-year moratorium. 
26542,toby,One year. Go vote. 
26543,toby,Really? 
26544,sam,Donna? 
26546,sam,I need Josh. 
26548,sam,"Yeah, tell him we're going to need more time. "
26550,josh,Yeah? 
26552,josh,Tell him to call the minority leader's office. Tell him we need to stage an exhibition. 
26554,josh,There's a rule against exhibitions on the house floor. He'll have one of our members bring a  poster on the floor another one of our members will object and the chair has to rule followed  by a vote of the full house and that'll buy 20 minutes. 
26556,josh," So... you're polling at slightly less than five percent in Iowa. After hearing  your issue profile that number actually goes down. 39% of caucus-goers say they wouldn't even  consider voting for you. ""Shares our values""? 18%. Did you know that? "
26557,josh,"In New Hampshire, you got three percent. ""Shares our values,"" 14%. After hearing your profile,  41% think you're a republican. Did you know that? "
26558,josh,"South Dakota, three percent; Georgia, eight percent; New York, seven percent. Did you know any  of that? "
26559,josh,"The reason why you didn't know, Jack, is that you don't even have the money to do out-of-state  polling right now. "
26560,josh,I did. Now with those kinds of numbers and no kind of money how can you expect to run a campaign? 
26561,josh,"He wasn't challenging a sitting president and NOBODY challenges a sitting president in a primary  by going to his right. This isn't a serious challenge you're contemplating so tell me what it is,  Jack. "
26562,josh,"Your health! We don't like your health. You're a Heisman trophy-winning football player, a U.S.  Olympian, you still run the New York Marathon and every time we see b-roll of you tossing a ball  around at the local boys' club it makes people think the president's got to campaign in an oxygen  tent. "
26563,josh,Yeah. That's what I want.
26564,leo,What do we know? 
26565,leo,What are they armed with? 
26566,leo,Any chance it's a training exercise? 
26567,leo,What do we think are the targets? 
26568,leo,Arab reaction? 
26569,leo,"Nancy, what about the C-4? "
26570,leo,Really? 
26571,leo,"Well, that may be our way out. All right, that may be it. Sally, I need to see the president. "
26572,c.j.,Yeah. 
26573,c.j.,The station can't send over someone who knows what they're doing? 
26574,c.j.,I have to watch this? 
26575,c.j.,Walk softly... and do something else. 
26576,c.j.,Yeah. Walk softly. Walk around.
26577,c.j.,Well... turns out she did know what she was doing. 
26578,c.j.,I'll take care of it.
26579,sam,"Hey, Margaret."
26580,toby,Be back in a second.  Charlie? 
26581,toby,You don't know what I was going to say. 
26582,toby,Yeah. 
26583,toby,I could have been talking about a flu vaccine. 
26584,toby,Yeah. 
26585,leo, Come on. 
26586,leo,"So, what's happening in there? "
26587,toby,"We've given him a one-year moratorium on grazing fees, support for anincrease in the production  flexibility contracts a promise not to lower agricultural export subsidies. We're up to a tougher  FDA crackdown on the illegal use of antibiotics in milk. "
26588,leo,Are you kid-? 
26589,toby,I swear to God. 
26590,leo,How's Buckland? 
26591,josh,"He wants a seat at the table, that's for sure. "
26592,toby,How far do we go with these guys? 
26593,josh,Can I offer Buckland-? 
26594,leo,No. 
26595,josh,"Well, he's going to keep mouthing off- "
26596,leo," I don't care, take him out! Enough's enough. First, Victor Campos then Kimball and his  band of four, then Buckland? Let him know we're going to put it out he tried to Blackmail the  President unless he caved to industry on clean air, clean water climate control, and worker safety.  Emphasize worker safety. That'll get him in good with the unions. "
26597,josh,Everyone will know the leak came from us. 
26598,leo,"Yeah. You know what? Bill Russell was getting eaten alive 'cause they could never get him to  throw an elbow. He didn't want to do it. So, Red Auerbach told him to do it one time. ""Throw an  elbow in a nationally televised game. You'll never have to do it again."" You bet your ass they'll  know the leak came from us. Toby, whatever's on the table in there... take it or leave it. "
26599,toby,"Yes, sir. "
26600,sam,Thank you. 
26601,toby,"Thanks, Leo. "
26602,sam, Hang on. 
26603,toby,What? 
26604,sam,Listen- 
26605,toby,Yeah? 
26606,sam,"What's on the table, don't you...? Grazing fees, farm nets, milk subsidies--what's on the table.  Aren't they the same things a farm district republican would want? "
26607,toby,Yeah. 
26608,sam,Let's offer it to them. 
26609,toby,Offer it to who? 
26610,sam,"Republicans. Royce. He'll carry six Republicans. That'll be seven votes. First off, when Kimball  and his four see we're going to win, they'll hop onboard so we've got a bigger margin. Second,  C.J. can make a big deal out of bipartisanship but mostly- "
26611,toby,We threw an elbow. 
26612,sam,On national TV. 
26613,toby,No. 
26614,toby,I think I will. 
26615,toby,No to everything. 
26616,toby,"I mean no to the FDA crackdown, no to lower agricultural subsidies, no to the production flexibility  contracts, no to the GAO review, and the president will seek to raise the grazing fees at any time  he sees fit. We're going to need the room. Would you mind, Congressman. "
26617,sam,Congressman? We're a little pressed for time. 
26618,sam,Thank you very much. 
26619,toby," Ginger! We need congressman Robert Royce, Republican of  Pennsylvania, on the phone. "
26620,sam,"Okay, well... now this really needs to work. "
26621,toby,Yeah.
26622,bartlet,Hey. How you feeling? 
26624,bartlet,It's all right. 
26626,bartlet,"Yeah, you're pretty gross. "
26628,bartlet,It's good... but... a suicide bomber got two American kids in Jerusalem. 
26630,bartlet,Yeah. 
26632,bartlet,We're pretty sure. We got some things going. 
26634,bartlet,19 and 21. They were brothers. You speak to Zoey today? 
26636,bartlet,I thought the deal was she calls once a day. 
26638,bartlet,I want her to call every day. 
26640,bartlet,All right. You need anything? 
26642,bartlet,Okay.
26643,leo,We can connect the bomber to Abdul Mujeeb.
26644,bartlet,How?
26645,leo,Traces of C-4 and other chemicals that are tagged.
26646,bartlet,So you think I get on the phone with the Chairman and...
26647,leo,I think you get on the phone and I think you tell him to hand Abdul Mujeeb over to the Israelis.  You remind him Israeli secret police are gonna kill him anyway.
26648,bartlet,It's gonna take more than that.
26649,leo,"If it does, you tell him..."
26650,bartlet,Congress?
26651,leo,Yeah.
26652,bartlet,We'll withhold the $100 million in NGO aid if they don't hand him over?
26653,leo,Yeah.
26654,bartlet,And you think handing him over puts the pin back in the grenade?
26655,leo,For a day.
26656,bartlet,For a day?
26657,leo,Yeah.
26658,bartlet, All right. Set up the call.
26659,leo,"Thank you, Mr. President."
26660,josh,Hang on-
26661,josh,Hang on--
26662,josh,I didn't say...
26663,josh,You...
26665,josh,Yeah.
26667,josh,"All right. Tell him to have a Democrat call for a journal vote. If a member calls for a journal  vote, the full House has to approve the previous day's floor activity."""
26669,josh,"After that, he can have a member try to attach an amendment to the override vote."
26671,josh,"Doesn't matter. ""To qualify for the estate tax repeal, the estates have to have Astroturf™."""
26673,josh,I'm sorry.
26674,josh,"No, I meant...I'm sorry.  You came through for us in Indiana. Really, the whole Midwest.  You would've been great in the number two spot. And it was me as much as anyone pushing Hoynes."
26675,josh,Yeah.
26676,josh," Listen, I have instructions to...you know..."
26677,josh,Yeah.
26678,josh,If I could convince Leo to put you on the short list...think you could say what you want to say?
26679,josh,"I know. But I can tell you that Carl Reed wants to accept a position at Shearson, and he'll be  leaving in about three months."
26680,josh,"Well, we're afraid of everything.  But no kidding, Jack,  I-I, I think you'd make an interesting nominee for Labor Secretary."
26681,josh,So if I could convince Leo...
26682,josh,"Thank you, Governor."
26683,sam,Yeah.
26684,sam,Yeah.
26685,sam,Yeah.
26686,sam,The illegal use of antibiotics in milk.
26687,toby,And the six that come with you.
26688,toby,Yes.
26689,toby,Yes.
26690,toby,"Congressman, you've been uneasy about the estate tax from the beginning."
26691,sam,What are you saying?
26692,toby,Are you saying...
26693,toby,If we do our best to see that you're not seriously challenged...
26694,toby," Go vote, Congressman."
26695,leo, You. Get in here.
26696,leo, Take the immunity.
26697,leo,Take it.
26698,leo,No one else is being offered it.
26699,leo,"Charlie, who the hell knows what's gonna happen with this prosecution? It's a partisan prosecution.  You could go broke! You could be barred from law school!"
26700,leo,Not necessarily.
26701,leo, Don't be a hero.
26702,leo, Yeah. Okay.
26703,leo,Thanks.
26704,leo,What are you smiling about?
26705,leo,Margaret?
26706,leo, Get me C.J. on the phone... And see if there's still any food over there.
26707,josh,"I got away with this thing, but you should really learn how to tie a bow tie. He tosses the tie  on her desk."
26709,josh,"Yeah, but that doesn't seem that likely, right? You can go home."
26711,josh, You wanted to talk to me about something before.
26713,josh,When?
26716,josh, You can't see him anymore.
26718,josh,You can't see him anymore.
26720,josh,It was just that night?
26722,josh,Yeah.
26724,josh,You just thought he was with Ways and Means who I was battling on the estate tax.
26726,josh,Did any reporters see you?
26728,josh,The second night?
26730,josh,All right. You can go home.
26732,josh,Thanks.
26733,c.j.,Phil.
26734,c.j.,"As I said, the President urged the parties to abide by the terms of the cease-fire and he reiterated  the United States's commitment to the peace process."
26735,c.j.,Katie.
26736,c.j.,"Well, I'm not gonna get into the details of the diplomatic exchange. There'll be more on that  tomorrow. I'm told at this moment the House is getting ready to vote on the override of the  President's veto, and I know you'll all want to cover that. Since this is the President's first  veto, I thought it might be helpful if we brushed up on the rules. Sherri, can you tell us how  many votes it takes to override a veto?"
26737,c.j.,"How many votes does it take to override, Sherri?"
26738,c.j.,"Actually, it takes two thirds."
26739,c.j.,"Yeah, 290. And how many votes does it take to sustain?"
26740,c.j.,"That should be easy. You just subtract 290 from the total number of members in the House, and add one."
26741,c.j.,"How many people sit in the House of Representatives, Sherri?"
26742,c.j.,"Okay, maybe you can get the notes from a classmate. That's all, guys. I'll see you in the morning."
26743,c.j.,Thanks.
26744,c.j.,Hey.
26745,c.j.,Yeah?
26746,c.j.,What? Are you crazy? That thing's going out to 154 affiliates!
26747,c.j.,"I changed my clothes because I didn't think it was appropriate to talk about the death of two  teenagers while wearing a ball gown, and you knew that. Because you're stupid, but you're not  stupid, you know what I'm saying? Security's gonna take your press credentials. You'll call my  office every day and I'll decide if you get into the room. I'm taking your spot on Pebble Beach -  you can do your stand-ups from Lafayette Park."
26748,c.j.,One more word out of your mouth and every local station in town but yours gets an exclusive with  the President. Hunting season on me is over.
26749,c.j., And the chemical abbreviation for table salt is NaCl.
26750,sam," You could say...you could say, ""On behalf of Abbey and myself, please accept our  deepest condolences. Your sons' lives were not lost in vain."""
26751,josh,They were lost in vain.
26752,sam,What I meant was that this calls national attention to the peace process.
26753,sam,"""Though tragic, this tragedy further calls national attention to this...alarming, escalating conflict."""
26754,toby,"Is there anything to: ""They went there in the spirit of peace""?"
26755,c.j.,"The spirit of peace, at a soccer match? Hope of Israeli and Palestinian children playing together and..."
26756,josh,"Studying together, discovering each other's worlds..."
26757,bartlet,"This guy at the dinner, he told me something I didn't know. On Yom Kippur, you ask forgiveness for  sins against God. But on the day before, you ask forgiveness for sins against people.   Did you know that?"
26758,toby,"Yeah. It's called, uh...I can't remember..."
26759,josh,It's... Erev.
26760,toby,Erev Yom Kippur.
26761,bartlet, You can't ask forgiveness of God until you've asked forgiveness of people on the day before. 
26762,bartlet, Yeah?
26763,bartlet,"Yeah, I'm gonna do this alone. Have a good night, everybody."
26764,bartlet," Mr. and Mrs. Levy, this is Jed Bartlet. I have three children. I really don't know what to say."
26765,c.j.,Okay.
26766,c.j.,Which gun?
26767,c.j.,"It was a .38 pistol. Okay, here are a few confirmations and a few more details. The  shooting took place approximately 15 minutes into the 9:00 service at United Baptist  Church in Abilene, Texas.  Will Sawyer, is that you?"
26768,c.j.,You back in the country?
26770,c.j.,You working for the San Francisco Chronicle now?
26772,c.j.,Then you want to get your ass out of their chair?
26774,c.j.,You see the little brass plaques with the names of media outlets on the front of the  seats?
26776,c.j.,Find a seat in back. 
26777,c.j.,"Fifteen minutes into the service, Daryl Bechtell, B-E-C-H-T-E-L-L, walked into the  sanctuary. Reports indicate he was looking for his estranged wife. He fired off a  round -- that was from the .38 -- missing his wife and hitting Harold Winter in the  left shoulder. Mr. Winter is 65 and currently undergoing surgery at Abilene Regional  Medical Center. "
26778,c.j.,She's be nine years old tomorrow.
26779,c.j.,No. The Abilene Sherrif's Office will address that. I can tell you that Mr. Bechtell's  gun was registered and that Ron Cahrl had a license to carry a concealed weapon.
26780,c.j.,"Again, I'll have the Sheriff's Office speak to that, but I'll tell you that it only  prohibits it if the church or synagogue posts such a prohibition in plain sight."
26781,c.j.,Hang on.  Well... Melissa Markey died.
26782,sam,"If you don't understand a question, say so. They'll repeat it. Or they'll rephrase it."
26784,sam,There's nothing wrong with not understanding the question.
26786,sam,There's nothing wrong with saying 'I don't recall.'
26788,sam,Yeah. Don't you want to go to this with Josh?
26790,sam,"No, he's not."
26792,sam,He didn't say anything.
26794,sam,All right.
26796,sam, You're going to be  sitting in a room. It's going to feel like you did something wrong. But guess what?
26798,sam,"You didn't! So, you got a cab up front?"
26800,sam,Come back when it's over?
26802,sam,Oakland over Dallas!
26803,sam,It's a lock.
26804,sam,"Everybody's staying away 'cause they want to keep Oakland down the road. But if you're  like me, you're not as impressed with the pre-season hype. You pick the Raiders at home,  and you bank on them not being a prohibitive favorite going into the playoffs."
26805,sam,You think I should take Tennessee over Detroit?
26806,sam,You said it with your eyes.
26807,sam,I'll take Tennessee over Detroit.
26808,sam,Write it down. Wait. No. Give me Oakland over Dallas.
26809,sam,Except make it New Orleans over Atlanta.
26810,sam,New Orleans over Atlanta!
26811,sam,Write it down. 
26813,bartlet, It sucked.
26815,bartlet,It sucked!
26817,bartlet,"Oh, like I'm not already going to hell."
26819,bartlet,It did lack penache.
26821,bartlet,"Yeah. She's skipping over the part that says, ""Wives, be subject to your husbands as to  the Lord, for a husband is the head of a wife as Christ is the head of the church."""
26823,bartlet,Why?
26825,bartlet,Okay.
26827,bartlet," ""In splendor."" And I have no problem with Ephesians.  And any time you want me to cleanse you with the washing of water, you know I'm up for it."
26829,bartlet,Hackery! 
26830,bartlet,This guy was a hack! He had a captive audience! And the way I know that is that I tried  to tunnel out of there several times. He had an audience and he didn't know what to do  with it.
26832,bartlet,Couldn't have hurt. Words...
26834,bartlet,"Words, when spoken out loud for the sake of performance, are music. They have rhythm,  and pitch, and timbre, and volume. These are the properties of music, and music has the  ability to find us and move us, and lift us up in ways that literal meanings can't. Do  you see?"
26836,bartlet,"Yes, I am. And God loves me for it."
26838,bartlet,"For other stuff, not for this. You can't just trod out Ephesians, which he blew, by the  way, it has nothing with husbands and wives, it's all of us. Saint Paul begins the  passage: ""Be subject to one another out of reverence to Christ.""  ""Be  subject to one another."" In this day and age of 24-hour cable crap, devoted to feeding  the voyeuristic gluttony of the American public, hooked on a bad soap opera that's  passing itself off as important, don't you think you might be able to find some relevance  in verse 21? How do end the cycle? Be subject to one another!"
26840,bartlet,"No, it's not about me! Well, yes, it is about me, but tomorrow it'll be about somebody  else. We'll watch Larry King and see who.  All hacks, off the stage! Right now!  That's a national security order."
26842,bartlet,How does Mrs. Sinatra feel about that?
26844,bartlet, You make me egg foo yung...
26845,c.j.,"Good morning, Mr. President."
26846,bartlet, You make me feel there are songs to be sung...
26848,c.j.," No, I won't. I'm sorry, Mr. President, Melissa Markey died."
26849,bartlet," Yeah, okay. "
26850,bartlet,"Ah, damn. Charlie, can I see Leo?"
26852,bartlet,Yeah.
26854,bartlet,Okay.  When do you think I should go in there?
26855,c.j.,I'd wait a couple of hours till we hear some more facts.
26856,bartlet,You'll talk to the sheriff's office and...
26857,c.j.,Yeah.
26858,bartlet,I guess the DA.
26859,c.j.,"Yeah, but you don't want to walk too far into that."
26860,bartlet,Yeah.
26861,leo,Good morning.
26862,bartlet,You heard?
26863,leo,Yeah.
26864,bartlet,C.J. thinks I should wait a few hours.
26865,leo,I would.
26866,bartlet,Yeah.
26867,c.j.,"Thank you, Mr. President. "
26868,bartlet,"Be subject to one another, Leo. What can I do to be of subject to you?"
26869,leo,I'm fine.
26870,bartlet,Yeah?
26871,leo,I've got Margaret.
26872,bartlet,Okay.
26873,leo,I think you should send Hoynes to Texas.
26874,bartlet,He's not going to want to do it.
26875,leo,What do you care?
26876,bartlet,What are you doing today?
26877,leo,I'm meeting with Adamley.
26878,bartlet,What about?
26879,leo,He wants to talk to me about the War Crimes Tribunal.
26880,bartlet,"Keep me out of it, all right?"
26881,leo,Yeah.
26882,bartlet,You think I should send Hoynes to Texas?
26883,leo,Yeah.
26884,bartlet,"All right, get him over here."
26885,leo,Now?
26886,bartlet,Yeah.
26887,leo," Thank you, Mr. President."
26902,c.j.,How are you doing?
26904,c.j.,You're sitting in my chair.
26906,c.j.," Oh, I've missed you."
26908,c.j.,"Well, you've been gone three weeks."
26910,c.j.,Really?
26912,c.j.,So what happened? I thought you were our man in Myanmar.
26914,c.j.,"Well, is there a third world country you haven't been kicked out of?"
26916,c.j.,Why'd they kick you out?
26918,c.j.,What happened?
26920,c.j.,Yeah?
26922,c.j.,Until?
26924,c.j.,Put a bounty on your head.
26926,c.j.,How'd you know?
26928,c.j.,Oh. That had to be embarrassing in front of your narco-baron friends.
26930,c.j.,No. No offense taken.
26932,c.j.,Why did you want to see me?
26934,c.j.,What is it?
26936,c.j.,"""If the President wins reelection, it will be on the Vice President's coattails""?"
26938,c.j.,He said this to you?
26940,c.j.,Where'd you get it?
26942,c.j.,"Will, do me a favor. Give me a little time to check it out, would you?"
26944,c.j.,You've been gone two and a half years?
26946,c.j.,Seemed like less than that.
26948,c.j.,Yeah.
26949,sam,"Thanks, Ginger. Thank you."
26950,sam,It's 30 billion in School Modernization Bonds.
26951,sam,"Interest-free for school districts. We're estimating it will help build and modernize  7,000 schools nationwide. There's another 1.5 billion for urgent repairs targeted to  high-need districts."
26952,sam,"Roof repairs, heating and cooling systems, electrical wiring. The point is we think we  need the Congressman's vote to get it out of the full Appropriations Committee and on the  floor."
26953,sam,That's what I thought.
26954,sam,What's it called?
26955,sam,Which provides for?
26956,sam,I'm sorry?
26957,sam,Why?
26958,sam,Yeah.
26959,sam,"Well, they're actually worth one cent."
26960,sam,"Well, that's not true. You can get yourself a gumball."
26961,sam,Really?
26962,sam,"Oh, don't make me give you a good reason."
26963,sam,"Well, we're already well on our way with 140 million pennies."
26964,sam,I'll get you a good reason.
26965,bartlet,Charlie!
26966,bartlet,You took Indianapolis?
26967,bartlet,Yeah?
26968,bartlet,Thank you.
26969,bartlet,"Hey, John."
26970,bartlet,Do you know this church?
26971,bartlet,The United Baptists Church in Abilene?
26972,bartlet,"Listen, you feel like having a beer with me?"
26973,bartlet,"On Sundays, when we got back from church, my father would let my brother and me split a  beer. It got to be a habit."
26974,bartlet,"Nancy?  Nancy, could I get  a cold beer and some ice water?"
26975,bartlet,And close the door please.  Nancy does what she was told.
26976,bartlet,"It's what Texans do.  The NRA systematically worked the legislatures to weaken conceal-and-carry  laws, the effect of which is to increase gun sales and pad its own membership."
26977,bartlet,The National Conference on State Legislatures is meeting this weekend at the Convention  Center in San Antonio.
26978,bartlet,Yeah.
26979,bartlet, It's also what Vice Presidents do.Nancy comes in and serves them beer and water.
26980,bartlet,"Thank you, Nancy."
26981,leo,Alan.
26982,leo,Come on back.
26983,leo,"No, no.  So how did it go?"
26984,leo,You know what we need in this country?
26985,leo,That's right.
26986,leo,What'd you get this time?
26987,leo,"You want to go down the Situation Room, and blow them off the face of the earth?"
26988,leo, So...
26989,leo,"Alan, it's a..."
26990,leo,It's an early draft. It's not a big thing.
26991,leo,Let's go inside and talk.
26992,c.j.,Hey.
26993,toby,I-I-I'm not here.
26994,c.j.,I called you at home. I had you paged.
26995,toby,Yeah.
26996,c.j.,I didn't know you were here.
26997,toby, I'm not.
26998,c.j.,I think the jig is up.
26999,toby,"Clearly, I'm here, but I-I-I'm not open for business. I heard the President was meeting  with Hoynes, so I-I-I wanted to see how-how it goes."
27000,c.j.,Listen...
27001,toby,And I see you picked Chicago over Cincinnati so let me explain to you why your money's  gonna be in my pocket.
27002,c.j.,"If the President wins reelection, it's gonna be on the Vice President's coattails?"
27003,toby, You want to know what's weird? I-I-I just said... that exact same thing a couple  of days ago.
27004,c.j.,I know. You know how I know? Will Sawyer just told me.
27005,toby,Will Sawyer's in Myanmar.
27006,c.j.,He got kicked out of Myanmar. He's in the room now.
27007,toby,"C.J., I said it... I said it at that W.A. meeting. I said it a the end of the meeting.  We were talking about areas where Hoynes is polling stronger than... It was...   Do I have a little time?"
27008,c.j.,A little.
27009,toby,Thank you.
27010,c.j.,You're here now?
27011,toby, Yeah.
27012,toby,Ginger?
27013,toby," I want you to page every junior staffer and senior assistant who works in the  West Wing, every single one. I want them to assemble downstairs in the mess in two hours."
27014,toby,"If they can't be here in two hours, then they don't need to come in tomorrow morning."
27028,josh,Why?
27029,sam,Why?
27030,josh,Yes.
27031,sam,Because this country is populated with unbalanced people. Many of whom find their way to  Washington. As if the continent funnels them into this one spot.
27032,josh,He wants to abolish the penny?
27033,sam,"He doesn't want to abolish it, as much as he wants to give his boss a reason why we can't."
27034,josh,Well... it's stupid.
27035,sam,"Yeah, but the thing is it isn't really."
27036,josh,Really?
27037,sam,It turns out the majority of pennies don't circulate. They go in jars and sock drawers.  Two-thirds of the pennies produced in the last 30 years have dropped out of circulation.
27038,josh,You've been reading about this?
27039,sam,It's interesting.
27040,josh,"No, it's not."
27041,sam, The Mint gets letters with pennies taped on notebook paper. Letters from  citizens who found the pennies on the street and mailed them back to the Treasury to  help pay down the debt.
27042,josh,It's almost hard to believe that plan hasn't worked.
27043,sam,It's also bad for the environment. Production requires the mining of millions of tons of  copper and zinc each year.
27044,josh,Zinc?
27045,sam,"In 1982, they changed the composition to 97.5% zinc and only 2.5% copper."
27046,josh,Sam?
27047,sam,I'm turning into one of the funnel people.
27048,josh,Yeah.
27049,sam, Donna thinks you're still pissed at her.
27050,josh,I'm not. I wasn't before. When did she tell you that?
27051,sam,Before she left. 
27052,josh,You've heard from her?
27053,sam,No.
27054,josh,She should be done by now.
27055,sam,Here's a riddle. What is the most ubiquitous man-made object in America that does not  interact with any mechanism or machine?
27056,josh,The penny?
27057,sam,"Then penny. You can't even throw it in a tollbooth. Well, except for Illinois."
27058,josh,Why can you use it in Illinois?
27059,sam,That's an interesting question.
27060,josh,"No, it's not. "
27061,c.j.,Hey.
27063,c.j.,I'm gonna have something for you soon. Toby's talking to some people.
27065,c.j.,"Hey, are you a king?"
27067,c.j.,"Somebody said you were hanging out with some tribe, and they made you a king."
27069,c.j.,Oh.
27071,c.j.,How'd you swing that?
27073,c.j.,So you're a god?
27075,c.j.,I gotta go there and bring my laptop. It quacks when I have e-mail.
27077,c.j.,What would happen?
27079,c.j.,"Yeah. No, good safety tip."
27081,c.j.,Yeah.
27083,c.j.,He's meeting with Leo McGarry.
27085,c.j.,"I don't know. Listen, you made a joke before."
27087,c.j.,About being assigned to the White House until you could get a real reporting job.
27089,c.j.,Was it a joke?
27091,c.j.,Okay. I'll have something for you on the other thing soon.
27093,bartlet,John...
27094,bartlet,"And if you look at the state of New Jersey, which has a ""may issue"" law-if you look at  changing that one word..."
27095,bartlet,"Changing that one word means law enforcement can decide who gets a concealed weapon and  when and where they can carry it. Texas has a ""may issue"" law in front of a legislature  right now, and you going down there..."
27096,bartlet,It's counter-scheduling. You go in front of an unfriendly audience. You tell them  something they don't want to hear-it shows you have courage.
27097,bartlet,You're a hero in Texas.
27098,bartlet,Texans don't like that you have the courage of your convictions?
27099,bartlet," Oh, yeah. I forgot."
27100,bartlet,That's not good enough.
27101,bartlet,"A tradition that's passed on from father to son? We tamed the frontier, John. We did that  already."
27102,bartlet,Let them stand in this room and say that. On this day. Let them stand in this room.  I like it?! She was nine years old! 
27103,bartlet,Green Bay lost.  She was nine years old.
27104,bartlet,Well... that is an excellent point. I never saw it that way.
27105,bartlet,Tighter ax control.
27106,bartlet,She didn't...
27107,bartlet,"You know what? Last year, gun deaths? 30,708. Alcohol deaths? 35,450. Tobacco deaths?  400,000. Marijuana deaths? Zero. This guy, the second shooter-Rambo? He's gonna get  nothing. He's gonna get a parade. You know why? There was no sign posted in the church  saying you can't carry a concealed weapon.  I'm just playing devil's advocate.  She was nine years old."
27108,leo,"Two things: One, technically, it's not just a court for war crimes."
27109,leo,"And two, the President hasn't made up his mind yet."
27110,leo,"The UN made up its mind in 1948, when they recognized the crime of genocide."
27111,leo,"A crime so immense as to exceed the jurisdiction of any single court or government. Alan,  systematic extermination of civilians, enslavement, torture, rape, forced pregnancy,  terrorism-doesn't the world need a permanent standing body...?"
27112,leo,Yeah.
27113,leo,"Come on. The court is designed with plenty of safeguards, to say nothing of if we don't  subject ourselves to the treaty, it'll encourage other countries..."
27114,leo,And you don't think that'll undercut the UN's campaign against war crimes?
27115,sam,"Excuse me. Excuse me, General."
27116,sam,Margaret wasn't out here.
27117,leo,What do you need?
27118,sam,"No, if you're in the middle of something, I can come back."
27119,sam,Eliminating the penny. So I'll come back.
27120,leo,Yeah.
27121,sam,Hey.
27123,sam,How'd it go?
27125,sam,"Just background, right?"
27127,sam,He's around someplace.
27129,sam," Do you know the only thing pennies interact with are those coin-wrapping machines  people buy to get rid of pennies, which kind of proves the point."
27131,sam,I don't know. It went okay?
27133,josh,How'd it go?
27135,josh,What happened?
27138,josh,What happened?
27140,josh,Why did you say you didn't?
27142,josh,What do you mean you don't know?
27144,josh,Is there anyone else in the witness list who knows you keep a diary?
27146,josh, What do you mean?
27149,josh,"You don't get to decide that! You don't get to decide what's material and what isn't,  Donna!"
27151,josh,"This is how it happens. They got nothing on the President with MS. They're trolling,  then you go in and hand them a..."
27153,josh,You were subpoenaed! You were under oath! You answer the damn question!
27156,josh,Do nothing. Do absolutely nothing.
27157,toby,"There's an old saying: ""Those who speak, don't know; and those who know, don't speak.""  I don't know if that's true or not, but I know that by and large the press doesn't care  who really knows what as long as they've got a quote. Last Friday, we had our Week Ahead  meeting in the Roosevelt Room. Some of you were there, most of you weren't, but I'm  talking to all of you now. Bruno Gianelli and I were leading a discussion about whether  or not the President should stop in Kansas on his way back from the West Coast, and I  remarked that the Vice President is polling better than the President right now in the  Plains states... "
27158,sam,That was unexpected.
27159,toby," Yeah... You're a good deputy, Sam."
27160,sam,What do you mean?
27161,toby,That.
27162,sam," You won money on football today, didn't you?"
27163,toby,"Yeah, but I mean it anyway. What can I do for you today? How can I help you out?"
27164,sam,You can give me a reason why the White House can't support the elimination of the penny.
27165,toby,This is the Legal Tender... Huckleberry Bill?
27166,sam,"Modernization Bill, yeah."
27167,toby,We can't support it 'cause it'll never get to the floor.
27168,sam,Why not?
27169,toby,Where's the Speaker of the House from?
27170,sam,"He's from Illinois, which, by the way, is the only state where you can put pennies in  a toll machine. Why is that, do you suppose?"
27171,toby,It's because...
27172,sam,It's 'cause Lincoln's from Illinois! And... so is the Speaker.
27173,toby,Yes.
27174,sam,"Well, that's a good reason. Well, it's a dumb reason, but it's good enough, right?"
27175,toby,Sure. They start walking up the stairs again.
27176,sam,Thank you.
27177,toby,Yeah.
27178,sam,And thanks for the other thing.
27179,toby,Yeah.
27180,c.j.,Hi.
27182,c.j.,What do you need?
27184,c.j.,"Yes, I did... Well, Toby made the remark in response to some new polling data. It was  offhand. Obviously, he meant it as a joke. He regrets it."
27186,c.j.,He'll be happy to go on the record with you.
27188,c.j.,What do you mean?
27190,c.j.,You're not gonna let Toby explain himself?
27192,c.j.,Why not?
27194,c.j.,Really?
27196,c.j., Okay.
27198,c.j.,"You weren't joking before, were you?"
27200,c.j.,When you said...
27202,c.j., Why do you think the White House is a bad beat?
27204,c.j.,Yeah... All right. 
27205,c.j.,You can sit anywhere you want. 
27206,leo,"139 countries have signed. 35 have ratified. Once 60 ratify, that's the ball game. You  want to be left out? "
27207,leo,What doesn't?
27208,leo,That won't happen.
27209,leo,How much of this is about hedging our bets?
27210,leo," Look, we set up Nuremberg! We set up the Tokyo War Crimes Trial. And that was  fine until we realized the Cold War threat was gonna take precedence. So when the German  rocket scientists came here to help us get into space..."
27211,leo,"...we looked the other way, while SS officers followed right behind, protected by  American intelligence services, 'cause they were gonna help us with the Communists. Oh,  please, Alan...So how much of this is hedging our bets?"
27212,leo,"Yeah. I think I do, yeah."
27213,leo,Yeah.
27214,leo,Yeah.
27215,leo, Yeah? 
27216,leo, It was a military target.
27217,leo,Why did you tell me that?
27218,leo, Why did you tell me that?!
27219,leo,We've been here awhile.
27220,leo,Maybe we'll call it a day.
27221,leo,I'll get you some time with the President this week.
27222,leo, Thank you.
27223,bartlet,"Can I ask you a question, just out of curiosity?"
27224,bartlet,"If guns are meant to deter the threat of crime, what's the point of concealing them?  I mean, wouldn't you want the criminal to see that you've got a gun?"
27225,bartlet,Then what's the answer to that?
27226,bartlet,You don't know?
27227,bartlet,"We can't all just agree it's a stupid-ass amendment that was written before there were  street lamps, much less police forces, and move on?"
27228,bartlet,There's no need for a citizen militia.
27229,bartlet,Then say so.
27230,bartlet,Only 16% believe gun ownership is an absolute right. Only 9% believe it's an absolute  wrong. There's a middle. We can win them!
27231,bartlet,Which we wouldn't have been doing if...
27232,bartlet,Nothing. 
27233,bartlet," You outed me, John. With that trip to Nashua, with the oil companies. You wanted  people to start asking questions."
27234,bartlet, So did my wife.
27235,bartlet,Look...
27236,bartlet,"Yes, it was."
27237,bartlet,"It's not easy being my Vice President, is it?"
27238,bartlet,"I wouldn't think so.  But it's the only way  you're gonna get the nomination. You know that, right? If I win."
27239,bartlet,Yeah. 
27240,bartlet,You'll go to Texas?
27241,bartlet,Yeah.
27242,bartlet,Yeah?
27243,bartlet,Thank you.
27244,bartlet,No.
27245,josh,"There's a coffee shop across the street. You can read it there. You've got an hour.  I haven't read it, but if anything bothers you, you'll issue a subpoena in the morning.  You'll have it back before the end of the day. If not, that's that."
27246,josh,"If I read any of this in the newspaper, or anything happens I don't like, I've got the  entries for October 4th and 5th."
27247,josh, You.
27248,josh, It's starting to get cold already. 
27249,josh,It's gonna be fine.
27250,leo,"One day, I'm gonna get called to the Situation Room, and it's gonna be good news. We'll  have discovered buried treasure, or it turns out there's life on Andromeda, and they think  we're doing a good job. When's that day gonna come, Nancy? When's that gonna happen?"
27251,leo,What do you need?
27252,leo,What were their orders?
27253,leo,"Well, they've gone quiet. They're a submarine."
27254,leo,But?
27255,leo,What are the other possibilities?
27256,leo,What hostle waters?
27257,leo,We haven't heard from them and they're in North Korea?
27258,leo,What do we have ready if we need to order a massive and undetectable rescue mission?
27259,leo,Why not?
27260,leo,You said they usually call.
27261,leo,I've gotta tell the President.
27262,leo,I'll be back.
27263,bartlet,The propellers aren't going.
27264,bartlet,They know I want to leave now?
27265,bartlet,The propellers aren't going.
27266,bartlet,"That makes sense. Also, there's a chance I could get hit getting on or off."
27267,bartlet,Excuse me?
27268,bartlet,You think I'm not tall enough to get hit in the neck by the propellers on Marine One?
27269,bartlet,"I duck when I get on that helicopter, and you should, too. It's just good safety sense."
27270,bartlet,They know I want to leave now?
27271,bartlet,"Filing day, Charlie. Last to get on the ballot in New Hampshire. "
27272,bartlet,"I'm going myself. Or, I could send an aide."
27273,bartlet,"I'm going myself. Always have, always will."
27274,bartlet,"Fair enough. Always have, never will. But I'm going myself. You know why?"
27275,bartlet,It's a profound statement about democracy. Are you mocking me?
27276,bartlet,The thing before wasn't a crack about my height?
27277,leo,You're all set to leave?
27278,bartlet,"Yes, I am. I'm going myself."
27279,leo,It's a profound statement about democracy.
27280,bartlet,"It's not a problem. I'm up, I'm back. The whole thing takes two hours."
27281,leo,"I think it's great, and I know how much you love doing it."
27282,bartlet,I do love doing this. It's one of my all time favorite...
27283,leo,Yeah. You can't go.
27284,bartlet,Why not?
27285,leo,It's one of those things we've talked about that sounds worse than it is because of your  inexperience with the military.
27286,bartlet,What is it?
27287,leo,Okay. The U.S.S. Portland is a Sea Wolf class or a big nuclear submarine.
27288,bartlet,Yeah.
27289,leo,"It has a crew of 137, is loaded down with highly classified intelligence gathering equipment,  and is in the waters off North Korea."
27290,bartlet,Right.
27291,leo, We don't have it right now.
27292,bartlet,"What does ""we don't have it"" mean?"
27293,leo,"Well, as you know, with our ship, our boats, and our submarines, we keep in pretty close  touch with radar, sonar, satellites, radio, encrypted messages, and we don't have the  Portland right now."
27294,bartlet,We don't have it?
27295,leo,We do not.
27296,bartlet,And they're in North Korea?
27297,leo,"Yes. Last we heard. So we're gonna set up meetings in the next few hours. Plus, if anything  happens, I don't like people to know that you were running for election while the boat was  out there."
27298,bartlet," Yeah. I think I'll go ahead and cancel that trip, Leo. If only to stick  around to see how this sounds worse than it really is."
27299,leo,I'll stick around too.
27300,bartlet,I think you will.
27301,c.j.,I'm glad. What is this song about?
27302,c.j.,"I know, for his shirt, he's too sexy."
27303,c.j.,He lists them.
27304,c.j.,*Too* sexy.
27305,c.j.,A hyperbole.
27306,c.j.,"So, it's not a problem. It's not a song about somebody having a problem."
27307,c.j.,Okay.
27308,c.j.,Not yet. Is there anything?
27309,c.j.,What did he say?
27310,c.j.,Wait a second. Are you telling me he got the question and he-
27311,c.j.,Get me the transcripts.
27312,bartlet,"Where's the damn submarine, Nancy? I don't want to hear I don't know, I want to hear how  many people are out there swimming around looking for it."
27313,leo," Nancy, I happen to agree with the president who, on military matters, by the way,  is a lot smarter..."
27314,bartlet,Shut up.
27315,leo,Yeah.
27316,bartlet,How long can the crew survive down there?
27317,bartlet,Yes.
27318,bartlet,How close are these guys to landfall?
27319,bartlet, Four thousand yards? They get that close?
27320,bartlet, Four thousand yards?
27321,leo, Yeah.
27322,bartlet,Can they send a distress signal?
27323,leo,"They can, but they won't if they think they'll be detected."
27324,bartlet,They would wait to send a distress signal and risk their lives?
27325,bartlet,"Well, that's great. I assess the national interest by the number of people alive, not dead.  You have four hours before I order the Pacific Fleet into Haeju Bay. "
27326,leo,We need to weigh in with somebody at State.
27327,bartlet,I agree.
27328,leo,Yes.
27329,bartlet,Is Peter still recovering?
27330,leo,Yes.
27331,bartlet,All right. We'll talk to someone else. Someone we trust.
27332,leo,Yes.
27333,bartlet,Anybody but...
27334,leo,Albie Duncan.
27335,bartlet,Anybody but him.
27336,leo,"No, I'm saying it's gotta be Albie Duncan"
27337,bartlet,Why? 
27338,leo,Because he knows what he's talking about.
27339,bartlet,So does Peter.
27340,leo,Peter's recovering from heart surgery.
27341,bartlet, Was it... I don't... Was it major heart surgery? 
27342,leo,We've gotta meet with Albie.
27343,bartlet,He's gonna scold me. He's been at the State Department since Truman. He thinks I'm a kid  and that he outranks me.
27344,leo,You'll be fine.
27345,bartlet,"I've gotta tell him I lost a submarine. Can I make something up, like ""say, a friend of  mine hypothetically..."""
27346,leo,We'll meet with him as soon as he can get here.
27347,bartlet,Bring a copy of the constitution. I'm gonna show him I'm not scared.
27348,leo,Hey Bruno. Hey Connie.
27349,bartlet,"Hey, Bruno, can you devise a campaign strategy that involves beating the crap out of Leo?"
27350,sam, He's in the...
27351,sam,"These aren't coming from our side, right?"
27352,sam,You want to run an ad?
27353,sam,How much is is going to cost?
27354,sam,Work up an ad for sixty bucks and a waffle and we'll talk.
27355,sam,We're gonna need that money in Iowa in nine weeks.
27356,sam,We don't even know if there's a challenger yet.
27357,sam,And you don't think the best way to do that is to keep the war chest intact?
27358,sam," Yeah, I'm talking about hard money, what are you talking about?"
27359,toby,Excuse me.
27360,sam,"Listen, Toby..."
27361,toby,What does one hundred and five million dollars mean to you?
27362,sam,What do you mean?
27363,toby,"I just got tipped that the new budget will include an additional one hundred and five  million dollars for the National Park Service, and that number means something, and I  can't remember what!"
27364,sam,I don't know.
27365,toby,Anybody?
27366,sam,Listen-
27367,toby," Just give me a few minutes, I'll be back. "
27368,toby,Does one hundred and five million dollars mean anything to you?
27369,toby," Yes, yes you are."
27370,toby,Bonnie? One hundred five million?
27371,c.j.,Toby...
27372,toby, C.J.?
27373,c.j.," I'm too sexy for my shirt, too sexy for my skirt,  too sexy... for the other...things."
27374,toby,What in God's name...
27375,c.j., He got the question.
27376,toby,Who?
27377,c.j.,The majority leader.
27378,toby,When?
27379,c.j.," Last night. Local news, Cleveland, Ohio. Oh-mio, oh-my-oh, Oh Cleveland Ohio!  He got the question!"
27380,toby,Why do you want to be President?
27381,c.j.,"""The reason I would run, were I to run, is I have a great belief in this country as a  country, and in this people as a people, that go into making this country a nation with  the greatest natural resources and people, educated people."""
27382,toby,I'll spread it around.
27383,c.j.," I'm too sexy for my shoes, too sexy for the  blues, too sexy..."
27384,c.j., Yeah?
27385,toby,"The new budget's going to have an additional one hundred and five million or the Park  Service, does one hundred and five million mean anything to you?"
27386,c.j.," No, except it's the same amount as the budget for the National Endowment  for the Arts."
27387,toby, Get me...
27403,toby,Tawny. 
27404,toby,Yes. 
27405,toby,Did your committee... 
27406,toby,Tawny... 
27407,toby,"By and large, I'm not wild about musicals. "
27408,toby,You're dissolving the Endowment to give more money to national parks? 
27409,toby,Look... 
27410,sam,No. 
27411,sam,I've done that a couple of times. But I didn't know there was funding available. 
27412,sam,Can I talk to you a second? 
27413,toby,Yeah. 
27414,sam,What's going on? 
27415,toby,Appropriations wants to eliminate the NEA. What's going on in there? 
27416,sam,He thinks it's time to run ads. 
27417,toby,With what? 
27418,sam,Soft money. 
27419,toby,"All right, I'll be in when I can. "
27420,sam,You know what? The NEA. That's 105 million. 
27421,toby,Yeah. 
27422,c.j.,Sam. 
27423,sam,Yeah? 
27424,c.j.,Did you hear? 
27425,sam,What? 
27426,c.j.,The Majority Leader got the question last night. 
27427,sam,And? 
27428,sam,Give me the transcript. 
27429,c.j.,"Yeah, listen... "
27430,sam,I gotta get back... 
27431,c.j.,"We've got an answer, right? "
27432,sam,To what? 
27433,c.j.,"If he's asked why he wants to be President, we've got a good answer. "
27434,sam,I'm...I'm sure we do. I've gotta get back in there. 
27435,c.j.,I'm...too sexy...
27446,sam,"You know what we're talking about, here? "
27447,sam,"Do you know what we're talking about, here? "
27448,sam,I wanna make sure Connie knows what we're talking about. 
27449,sam,Fine.
27450,sam,Yeah? 
27451,sam,"We're talking about unlimited, unregulated money that can be raised in staggering amounts. "
27452,sam,"Understand, it's not like there's a law that envisions soft money - it's just that there's  no law that specifically bans it. It's a loophole so big you could race the America's Cup  through it. How can the President be opposed to soft money one year and take it the next?  Where's he gonna be on campaign finance reform tomorrow? "
27453,sam,"Excuse me, but there's such a thing as... "
27454,sam,There's... such a thing as... 
27455,sam,"Okay, I'm gonna sit quietly for a moment. "
27456,sam,Leadership by example. There's such a thing as leadership by example. 
27457,sam,"They're really talking about this, huh? "
27458,sam,Toby's gonna be in on it.
27459,bartlet,Every single election...
27460,leo,Yes. 
27461,bartlet,"Legislature, house, governor. "
27462,leo,Yeah. 
27463,bartlet,President. 
27464,leo,"Yeah. It's a statement about democracy. I've heard it before, I was just... "
27465,bartlet,Is he here? 
27466,bartlet,Okay. It's a profound statement about democracy. 
27467,bartlet,"Good morning, Albie. "
27468,leo,"Good to see you, Albie. "
27469,bartlet,Can I get you anything? 
27470,bartlet,Coffee? Soft drink? 
27471,bartlet,"Okay. Okay. I've asked you here, Albie, because you're the assistant Secretary of State and I,  of course, am the President. "
27472,bartlet,"See, right away... "
27473,leo,"Don't worry about it. Albie, the Pac Fleet commaders informed us that we've lost contact  with the Portland. "
27474,leo,Yeah 
27475,bartlet,Lake George. 
27476,leo,Somewhere in Haeju bay. 
27477,bartlet,"Thanks, Albie. That much, the National Security Council has made clear to me. "
27478,leo,Nancy thinks there is. 
27479,leo,No. 
27480,bartlet,"And if they were in trouble, you see, they wouldn't send a distress signal 'cause they might  be detected and submariners have a different set of criteria when assessing risk versus reward. "
27481,leo,He knows. 
27482,bartlet,"Okay, I'll just stand over there. "
27483,leo,The president wants to give four hours before a rescue. We're an hour into it. 
27484,leo,Yeah. Who we talk to in the meantime? 
27485,leo,You're sure? 
27486,leo,We don't talk to the North Koreans? 
27487,bartlet,"Cause for war. Little thing called Latin. Albie, if we tell North Korea we've violated their  waters it could be interpreted as an act of war? "
27488,bartlet,We tell 'em it's not. 
27489,bartlet,Okay.  Can I talk to you alone for a second? 
27490,leo,Yeah. 
27491,bartlet,Let's not call North Korea just yet. 
27492,leo,No. 
27493,bartlet,Leo. Gut feeling. Has the boat gone quiet? 
27494,leo,"Yeah. Trust the captain, trust the crew. "
27495,bartlet,All right. Three more hours. 
27496,leo,I think he should stay. 
27497,bartlet,Who? 
27498,leo,"Albie. He can talk us through some things, and if we need to start making calls, he'll be helpful. "
27499,bartlet,"Also, he'd be good to have around for morale, 'cause he's Mr. Happy Fun Guy. "
27500,leo,Look... 
27501,bartlet,Albie. I'm gonna ask you to stay around for a while. 
27502,bartlet,Charlie! 
27503,bartlet,"Charlie, could you have someone bring some Schweppes' Bitter Lemon and the Constitutional  Order of Succession, please? "
27504,josh," New paragraph. As always, your thoughtfulness is greatly appreciated. Also appreciated  was the visit to the White House by some fifty of your constituents on board a bus that was  chartered by your office. Their complaints were respectfully heard by my assistant and I regret  that matters escalated to the point where she felt it necessary to call in the Park Police.  You'll be happy to know that their bus has been refueled and that the seniors are on their  way home, each having been allowed to keep their security tags as a souvenir. "
27506,josh,Signed... 
27508,josh,Do it. 
27509,c.j.,Excuse me. 
27510,josh,Hey.
27511,c.j.,You got a second? 
27512,josh, Type that.
27514,josh,Type it. 
27516,josh,What's wrong with yours? 
27518,josh,Go ahead. 
27519,josh,We had a little problem earlier. What's up? 
27520,c.j.,The Majority Leader got the question last night. 
27521,josh,"Yeah. And he just kept on diggin'. 'We have the greatest technolgy of any people of any country  in the world along with the greatest--not the greatest, but very serious problems confronting  our people, and I want to be President in order to focus on these problems in a way that uses  the energy of our people to move us forward, basically.' "
27522,c.j.,Yes. 
27523,josh,It's the basically that makes it art. 
27524,c.j.,"Listen, the best thing we can do is to take a step back. We can't be seen to be gloating. "
27525,josh,"Sure, yeah. We, we do that when nobody's looking. "
27526,c.j.,Okay 
27527,josh,Anything else? 
27528,c.j.,No.
27529,josh,Poured Wheatina on her keyboard.
27530,c.j.,Listen - How good is our answer? 
27531,josh,"Oh, it's good. "
27532,c.j.,Really? 
27533,josh,Yeah. 
27534,c.j.,What is it? 
27535,josh,Do we have one? 
27536,c.j.,Josh! 
27537,josh,I'm sure we have one. 
27538,c.j.,Will you check? 
27539,josh,Yeah 
27540,c.j.,Will you check today? 
27541,josh,Yeah. 
27542,c.j.,Thank you! 
27543,josh,Okay.
27544,toby,The mission of the NEA IS to subsidize artists in this country. 
27545,toby,"In fact, it's not to subsidize artists - it's to subsidize art. "
27546,toby,"Well, they're pretty bright in Topeka. None of the artists you mentioned ever received any  direct money from the Endowment. Why? Because the last time the Republicans tried to lose  the NEA - not three times ago, but the last time - we got rid of the individual grants! "
27547,toby,"Tawny, you'd need the Budweiser Clydesdales to drag my ass to Picasso and Monet! I'm not the  guy you want deciding this! And you're not the guy I want deciding this! And I don't know  where you get the idea that taxpayers shouldn't have to pay for anything of which they  disapprove. Lots of 'em don't like tanks. Even more don't like Congress. "
27548,sam,Hi. 
27549,sam,Excuse us. 
27550,toby,"Look, we can't spend soft money on a primary ad anyway, so... "
27551,sam,"No, he's passing the magic words test. "
27552,toby,What magic words test? 
27553,sam,"The US Supreme Court, Buckley v. Valeo. The court created a loophole by ruling only apply  to communications that in express terms advocate the election or defeat of a clearly-identified  candidate for federal office."
27554,toby,If it doesn't use those specific words... 
27555,sam,No. 
27556,sam,Why is like water on pavement? 
27557,sam,"The standard ought to be, does the ad try to influence the outcome of the election? If so, you  can't use soft money, period. "
27558,sam,Excuse me? 
27559,sam,Toby? 
27560,toby,"I've gotta go back in there. When I come back, show me an ad without the magic words."
27574,leo,They smoke in subs? 
27575,bartlet,"Oh, God, I'm sorry, am I still here? "
27576,bartlet,"I haven't lost the boat yet, Mr. Secretary, and I happen to be the only one in the building  who thinks we should be sending the fast attack subs right now. And I'm an hour from  gathering the NSC and calling Japan. "
27577,bartlet,Leo... 
27578,leo,Albie... 
27579,bartlet,"There was a UN action, Mr. Secretary. Sixteen countries were involved in that police action,  Mr. Secretary. Thirty-three, thirty-four thousand American dead. How come we're the only ones  still fighting? Where did everybody go? "
27580,bartlet,Yeah. 
27581,bartlet,Send him in. 
27582,josh,"Good afternoon, sir. "
27583,bartlet,"Hey, Josh. "
27584,josh,"Good afternoon, Mr. Secretary. Anything going on I should know about? "
27585,leo,We're just catching up. 
27586,josh,This can wait for another time. 
27587,bartlet,"No, give it to me now. I want a distraction. "
27588,josh,"No, it's all right sir. "
27589,bartlet,Give it to me. 
27590,josh,It's campaign-related. 
27591,bartlet,That's okay. 
27592,josh,"Well, the, uh Majority Leader got the question last night. "
27593,leo,He tanked. 
27594,josh,"Yeah, and we're starting to put together an answer for when you get it. "
27595,bartlet,The question? 
27596,josh,Why do you want to be President? 
27597,bartlet, I don't. 
27598,josh,"Well, we'll put that in the hopper and show you a draft. "
27599,bartlet,Good. 
27600,josh,"Thank you, Mr. President.  "
27601,bartlet,Leo. 
27602,leo,Fifty-five minutes.
27603,josh,This is a time of dizzying change and progress around the world. I'm running for re-election  'cause I want to make sure that all our people can share in 21st century jobs-- 
27604,c.j.,Jobs and industries we can't even imagine today...bring the benefits of new medical  advancements to all our families-- 
27605,josh,And harness new technology and the internet as a force for faster economic growth-- 
27606,c.j.,Better education and a freer exchange of ideas around the world. 
27607,josh,Yes. 
27608,c.j.,There it is. 
27609,josh,That's fine. 
27611,josh,You wanna say something? 
27613,josh,I thought it was-- 
27614,josh,"It's got crisp, commanding phrases, it's got active verbs like 'harness,' it paints a  picture of the future-- "
27616,josh,She's got a point. 
27617,c.j.,Sometimes you get your face on a coin. 
27618,josh,Okay. This shouldn't be hard.
27619,toby,"You guys should charge money for this, Tawny. You should sell tickets and charge money and  call it ""Journey Back to Germany."" Where, in 1937, they held a show of degenerate art,  vilifying art they deemed sick, art that featured insolent mockery of the divine, art that  wasted the taxes of the German working people. "
27620,toby,Look... 
27621,toby,Me too. 
27622,toby,In Europe and Japan they're spending between 1.5 and 3 billion on the arts. Congress thinks  105 million is indulgent? 
27623,toby,There is a connection between progress of a society and progress in the Arts. The age of  Pericles was also the age of Phidias. The age of Lorenzo de Medici was also the age of  Leonardo Da Vinci. The age of Elizabeth was the age of Shakespeare. 
27624,toby,Says you! 
27625,toby,National parks? 
27626,toby,Security. 
27627,toby,Really. 
27628,toby,"The parks are safe, Tawny. We spend a lot of money on that. "
27629,toby,And the money for that could come from someplace else. 
27630,toby,Like... 
27631,toby,Yeah.  What do you want? 
27632,toby,Get rid of Oakenwood. 
27649,sam,Yeah. 
27650,sam,You've changed five words. 
27651,sam,They're not magic. 
27652,sam,It's a scam 
27653,toby,Where are we? 
27654,sam,Bruno and Connie have managed to fight their way out of the straitjacket of our campaign  finance laws. 
27655,sam,It's a candidate ad with some words changed! 
27656,sam,Connie... 
27657,sam,Why are you so bent on carrying these idiot leaflets? 
27658,toby,I agree. 
27659,sam,Toby... 
27660,toby,So let's stick to the spirit of the law. 
27661,sam,The spirit of the law means no soft money. 
27662,toby,"No, I'm saying let's do an issue ad, an actual issue ad. Let's do a bunch. Health care,  equal opportunity-- "
27663,toby,School construction. Does anyone think that raising awareness of crumbling schools won't  help us? 
27664,sam,There's actually a reasonable point here. New polls see Republicans as better on education  with no basis for it.
27665,toby,"And when schools fall down, so do test scores. "
27666,sam,Yes. 
27667,sam,It's not amoral. 
27668,sam,"Okay. Across America, Schools are crumbling..."
27669,bartlet,Okay. 
27670,bartlet,It's time. 
27671,bartlet,Yeah. We're going now. 
27672,bartlet,What happened? Did you contact Pac fleet? 
27673,bartlet,"And San Diego, right? "
27674,bartlet,Tell me what they do. 
27675,bartlet,Whiskey Three? 
27676,bartlet,How many trips will it take? 
27677,bartlet,What about injured? 
27678,bartlet,Let's go get 'em. Time's up. 
27679,leo,Sir? 
27680,bartlet,What? 
27681,bartlet,What does that mean? 
27682,leo,We have the Portland on satellite. 
27683,bartlet,What does that mean? 
27684,leo,We have them. 
27685,bartlet,"All right, okay. There they are. See, they went deep and quiet to avoid a close-aboard with  a Luna class destroyer. What you gotta do in these situations is you trust the captain,  you trust the crew. "
27686,leo,"Yes, sir."
27687,bartlet,Hey.
27688,bartlet,It got filed? 
27689,bartlet,It got filed? 
27690,bartlet,So I'm on the ballot in New Hampshire. 
27691,bartlet,Okay.  When Romans ran for the office of Counsel - did I just see you roll your eyes? 
27692,bartlet,"They wore whitened togas to show their intent - a bit silly, perhaps... "
27693,bartlet,But it was an act of personal commission. 
27694,bartlet,What? 
27695,bartlet,You're pretty mouthy today. 
27696,bartlet,Hey. 
27697,c.j.,"Good afternoon, Mr. President. "
27698,bartlet,Hey. Do you duck when you're getting on Marine One? 
27699,c.j.,"No, sir. "
27700,bartlet,Okay. 
27701,c.j.,Should I? 
27702,bartlet,I think the blades are high enough. 
27703,c.j.,The Majority Leader got the question last night. 
27704,bartlet,I heard. 
27705,c.j.,He went to the zoo.
27706,bartlet,"Yeah, listen. I want you to go easy on him. He's a conscientious and dedicated guy.  It's not an easy question. "
27707,c.j.,Can you answer it? 
27708,bartlet,Why do I want to be President? 
27709,c.j.,Yeah. 
27710,bartlet, I've been thinking about it for the last couple of hours. I almost had it.
27711,bartlet,I'm not wild about Camp David.
27712,c.j.,"Yes, sir."
27713,bartlet,"I'm not the only one, either. Bess Truman didn't like it. I read that somewhere.  She thought it was dull.  But there I go, Thanksgiving at Camp David."
27714,c.j.,Yeah.
27715,bartlet," It's not a place you go at Thanksgiving, not when you have a farm."
27716,c.j.,Isn't Camp David a farm?
27717,bartlet,No.
27718,c.j.,Oh.
27719,bartlet,What makes you think it's a farm?
27720,c.j.,"I don't know, it's outside..."
27721,bartlet,"Farms have things you can grow, and animals."
27722,c.j.,Right.
27723,bartlet,I want you to learn more about farms.
27724,c.j.,There's more?
27725,bartlet,Yeah.
27726,c.j.,Okay. 
27727,bartlet,"Doesn't matter. Thanksgiving's where your family is, and this year my family's at  Camp David. Why, I do not know. Abbey didn't wanna schlepp to New Hampshire.  Schlepping in a 747. It's not like we were gonna have to carry our own bags or  anything, but I do not argue. "
27728,bartlet,Were we talking about something?
27729,c.j.,"I don't know, sir. When I came in here, back in the late '50s, there was a purpose to it,  but then one thing led to another and I blacked out. I mean, I can hang in there with  the best of them, sir, but somewhere during the discussion of anise and coriander and  the other 15 spices you like to use to baste a turkey, I simply lost consciousness."
27730,bartlet, You know that line you're not supposed to cross with the President?
27731,c.j.,I'm coming up on it?
27732,bartlet,No-no. Look behind you.
27733,c.j.,"Yes, sir."
27734,bartlet,Would you like to leave?
27735,c.j.,"With your permission, sir."
27736,bartlet,"Damn right, with my permission. "
27737,c.j.,"Yes, sir. "
27738,bartlet,"It's the brine that keeps the meat soft, lady. You soak it overnight in water, salt, sugar..."
27739,c.j., Seventeen kinds of--
27740,bartlet,Seventeen kinds of spices including?
27741,c.j., Anise and coriander.
27742,bartlet,Now you can go.
27743,c.j.,"Thank you, Mr. President. "
27744,josh,How you doing?
27745,c.j.," I'm done, baby."
27746,josh,Yeah?
27747,c.j.," I set up the I Board meeting with the Post on budget gains,  I did an early briefing on the week loot and import quarter proclamation, reported the  turkey, went to my dentist. I'm done."
27748,josh,So there are these two Indians in the lobby.
27749,c.j.,Yeah?
27750,josh,"No, it's-it's not the beginning of a joke. I'm saying there's these two Indians in the lobby."
27751,c.j.," And I'm saying ""yeah?"""
27752,josh,"They had a meeting scheduled this morning with Jacob Cutler at Intergovernmental Affairs.  Cutler had to cancel the meeting so he could see northwestern border state governors to  discuss pourous borders between the U.S. and Canada, that's the governors of Washington,  Idaho, North Dakota, Montana and Alaska."
27753,c.j.,Yeah?
27754,josh,"Yeah, well, apparently the Indians say they're not leaving until they get satisfaction."
27755,c.j., How is this my problem?
27756,josh,"C.J., there's two Indians sitting in the lobby, they say they're not leaving, there's  press everywhere. I just made it your problem."
27757,c.j., Indians on the day before Thanksgiving. Wow. Ironic. 
27758,josh,Yeah.
27759,c.j.,  Good morning. I'm CJ Cregg.
27760,c.j.,"I'm sorry about your meeting, Mr. Cutler had to meet with some northwestern governors  about an important problem."
27761,c.j.,It'll be no problem to reschedule the appointment.
27762,c.j.,Would you like to step into my office and we can try to reschedule it right now?
27763,c.j.,I'm sorry?
27764,c.j.," Actually, you're not fine here."
27765,c.j.,"This is gonna have something to do with us screwing you out of all your land, isn't it?"
27766,c.j.,"See, I was done."
27767,josh,I was just coming to see you. Did you hear about the two Indians in the lobby?
27768,leo,One of them wants to become a rabbi?
27769,josh,"It's not a joke, they're really... Nevermind."
27770,leo,Last week a 13-year-old kid in Georgia shot his teacher in the back of the head.
27771,josh,"I read about that. They can't find the kid, right?"
27772,leo,Interpol made the arrest last night in Rome.
27773,josh,In Italy?
27774,leo,"His parents... Yeah, Rome. In Italy. His parents sent him there as soon as it happened.  The parents are in custody, obviously the governor wants him back, and Italy won't  extradite to a country that has the death penalty. The governor wants Justice to help."
27775,josh,Why isn't this conversation taking place in the DeKalb County DA's office?
27776,leo,It's taken on an international flavor.
27777,josh,Much like myself.
27778,leo,Yeah. You'll talk to some people?
27779,josh,Si.
27780,leo,And you'll stop doing that soon.
27781,josh,Yeah.
27782,toby, Sam? Are you guarding my office?
27783,sam, That's funny.
27784,toby,Thank you. 
27785,toby,Yeah?
27786,sam," On Monday, the OMB is putting out a new formula for calculating the  poverty level."
27787,toby,I saw that. Doesn't it need Presidential approval before it goes to Congress?
27788,sam,Yeah.
27789,toby,What's the problem?
27790,sam,"It's a good news, bad news thing. Under the new formula, poverty is up two percent. It was  anyone under seventeen thousand, five hundred and twenty-four before, now it's twenty thousand. "
27791,toby,What does that shake out to?
27792,sam,Four million new poor people.
27793,toby,Four million?!?
27794,sam,"Yeah. Obviously, that's the bad news."
27795,toby,Yeah...
27796,sam,The good news is more people will be eligible for benefits.
27797,toby,And taxpayers are nuts about that. Let's get back to the bad news. Four million people  became poor on the President's watch?
27798,sam,They didn't become poor. They were poor already. And now we're calling them poor.
27799,toby,What was wrong with the old formula?
27800,sam,I don't know.
27801,toby,Find out.
27802,sam,It is possible that this is a statistical reality and not a political finding.
27803,toby,"Well, get together with somebody at OMB and find out what was wrong with the statistical  reality of the old formula."
27804,sam,Yeah.
27805,toby,And do it today.
27806,sam, Yeah.
27807,toby,It's like when they did that thing with the SAT scores and I got dumber twenty years  after I went to college.
27808,sam,It's a little like that.
27809,toby,Talk to somebody.
27810,sam,Yeah.
27811,c.j.,Yes. Listen-
27812,c.j.,"Listen, this isn't a good place for this. This is... a lobby."
27813,c.j.,Yes.
27814,c.j.,What tribe are you from?
27815,c.j.,And you were forced to sell the land?
27816,c.j.,"Well, before we go any further, I should tell you, there's absolutely nothing I can do for you."
27817,c.j.,Yes.
27818,josh,Did you get me a flight?
27820,josh,Excellent. One that gets me there in time for dinner?
27822,josh,And I don't have to change planes in Atlanta?
27824,josh,I told you that-
27826,josh,There must be something.
27828,josh,It would trigger a Congressional investigation?
27830,josh,Find me... something.
27832,josh,And remember to scold me a couple times before I leave.
27834,josh,"No, but I thought I was going to Connecticut."
27836,josh,'Cause that's where the house is.
27838,josh,I made a mistake.
27840,josh,"I'm from Connecticut, okay?! And like a swallow to Capistrano, I have to... Just, find me  a flight, would you? And call Russell Angler at the State Department and tell him I need  to see him about the kid in Georgia, he'll know what I'm talking about."
27842,josh," You're the girl I made fun of in elementary school, you know that?"
27844,sam,"Donna, can I go in?"
27846,sam,"Yeah, but you gotta change planes in Atlanta."
27848,josh,Did you hear about this kid?
27849,sam,The one who shot his teacher?
27850,josh,"His parents, who are in custody, Fed-Exed him to Rome, which is in Italy."
27851,sam,You're kidding me?
27852,josh,"No, it's really in Italy."
27853,josh,But that's not the best part.
27854,sam,Italy won't extradite him.
27855,josh,The best part is that Italy won't extradite him.
27856,sam,Because of the death penalty in Georgia?
27857,josh,They've come a long way since Mussolini.
27858,sam,You should mention that.
27859,josh,I will.
27860,sam," So, it turns out we've got four million new poor people."
27861,josh,Since when?
27862,sam,"Well, yesterday, actually."
27863,josh,The OMB's recommending a new model?
27864,sam,Yes.
27865,josh,"Well, I'm not an expert, but wouldn't we have a better chance at getting re-elected if we  could say there were four million fewer poor people? Hang on, wait. I am an expert."
27866,sam,"Well, I think we'd have a better chance at getting re-elected if there actually were four  million fewer poor people, but I'm gonna talk to Bernice Collette anyway."
27867,josh, You gonna try and get her not to recommend the new model?
27868,sam,"Well, to hold off for a while, anyway."
27869,josh, You know Bernice?
27870,sam,That's why I came to you.
27871,josh, She's a little tough to warm up.
27872,sam,I'll warm her up.
27873,josh,Yeah?
27874,sam,Jokes. Nicknames. That sort of thing.
27875,josh,Sounds like you've got a pretty good plan.
27876,sam,Anything else I need to know?
27877,josh,Don't go through the lobby.
27878,sam,Why not?
27879,josh, Indians in the lobby.
27880,sam, Is that code?
27881,josh,No. There are Indians in the lobby.
27882,sam,Okay.
27883,bartlet,"Bess Truman didn't like Camp David, either, she thought it was dull. Doesn't matter."
27884,bartlet,"Long as you've got an oven, and you go to three hundred and twenty degrees. You take your  turkey, which has been soaking overnight in water, salt, coriander..."
27885,bartlet,She was asking me.
27886,bartlet,Yeah.
27887,toby," Good morning, sir."
27888,bartlet,Hey.
27889,toby,"Before anything else, I was hoping I could impose on you for as much information you could  spare about making a turkey."
27890,bartlet,This is some sort of pre-emptive psychological thing?
27891,toby,Yeah.
27892,bartlet,That's not going to work.
27893,toby,"Yeah. You're gonna see, on next week's message calendar, there's a notation about a new  federal initiative to provide low-cost cell phones to neighborhood watch groups."
27894,bartlet,I saw the message calendar. I'm having some difficulty navigating the color-coding.
27895,toby,"The colors are for areas - Blue is education... Green is economy, it's a quick glance way  to let us know if we're getting enough hits on our issues."
27896,bartlet,"Well, there should be a separate color for things I don't care about."
27897,toby,Like what?
27898,bartlet,Providing low-cost cell phone service to neighborhood watch groups.
27899,toby,It's important.
27900,bartlet,Really?
27901,toby,"You spot a crime, you gonna go to a pay phone?"
27902,bartlet,"There's nothing wrong with the policy, it's just too small. I could fund this initiative  out of my pocket."
27903,toby,It's ten million dollars.
27904,bartlet,"Leo could fund it out of his pocket. Shouldn't this be local government, like the YMCA  or something?"
27905,toby,"We have an idea, which we have reason to believe is popular, which is, that in addition  to passing large and abstract pieces of legislation-"
27906,bartlet,"We pass minute, but easy to understand."
27907,toby,"Yes, sir."
27908,bartlet,How popular?
27909,toby,Eighty-two percent.
27910,bartlet,Get out of here.
27911,toby,Hand to God.
27912,bartlet,Bring me that polling data.
27913,toby,What kind of stuffing are we talking about?
27914,bartlet,"Cornbread, oysters, water chestnuts, andouille sausage."
27915,toby,You gonna cook on the inside or separate?
27916,bartlet,Inside.
27917,toby,You better make sure it cooks.
27918,bartlet,It'll cook. 
27919,toby,"If it doesn't cook, people are gonna get sick."
27920,bartlet,It'll cook.
27921,toby,"They'll be very, very sick."
27922,bartlet,I've got it covered. Anything else?
27923,toby,You know about the new OMB definitions?
27924,bartlet,I know they're coming out. What's it going to look like?
27925,toby,Depends. You want more poor people or fewer poor people?
27926,bartlet,Fewer.
27927,toby,"You got it. Thank you, Mr. President."
27928,bartlet,"...carroway seeds, thyme, cornbread, oysters, water chestnuts and Handui sausage."
27929,leo,Sounds good.
27930,bartlet,"Yeah. But Toby seemed to indicate that you have to be careful if you cook it inside the  turkey, because in some cases it doesn't cook, and when that happens, people get sick."
27931,leo,Yeah.
27932,bartlet,You know about this?
27933,leo,I've heard about it.
27934,bartlet, 'Cause I thought Toby might be playing with me.
27935,leo,Maybe he is.
27936,bartlet,But you said you've heard of it.
27937,leo,"Maybe I am, too."
27938,bartlet,"Nah, you don't have that kind of wit."
27939,leo,Yeah.
27940,bartlet,I need to talk to an expert.
27941,leo,Talk to Rene.  Margaret!
27942,bartlet,I can't ask Rene.
27943,leo,The President needs to speak with the head chef. Could you try him at home?
27944,bartlet,"No. No, I can't. Thanks Margaret. "
27945,bartlet,I can't ask Rene right now.
27946,leo,Why not?
27947,bartlet,"Well, frankly, I thought he did something stupid and inconsiderate last week, but it  turns out I was just in a bad mood."
27948,leo,You gave Rene a firm talking to?
27949,bartlet,"Yes. And while he didn't deserve it, he will someday soon. "
27950,leo,Come on in.
27951,bartlet,82 percent are in favor of fixing potholes?
27952,leo,Yeah.
27953,bartlet,I'm gonna look at this.
27954,leo,Okay.
27955,bartlet,"They want the nickel and dime stuff, I'll tell you one thing we can do."
27956,bartlet,This time of the year there should be a hotline you can call with questions about cooking  turkey. A special 800 number where the phones are staffed by experts.
27957,bartlet,What do you mean?
27958,bartlet, Butterball has a hotline?
27959,bartlet,Are you kidding me?
27960,bartlet,"God, I'm sorry, I love my country. Charlie, get me the number for the Butterball hotline."
27961,bartlet,Hang on. 
27962,bartlet,I don't think this is the right one.
27963,bartlet,"Yeah, this is something different. Hang on a second. This is--  Find Bruno Gianelli, tell him I wanna see him right away."
27964,sam,Yeah?
27965,sam,Thanks.
27966,sam,"How ya doing, Bernie?"
27967,sam,Sure. What should I call you?
27968,sam,But how will you know I'm your buddy?
27969,sam, Okay. 
27970,sam,Can you tell me how the current standard was reached?
27971,sam,The current one. The new one hasn't been signed off on.
27972,sam,Why?
27973,sam,Well how was the old one reached? The current one.
27974,sam,Our cost of living formula for the last 40 years has been based on life in Poland during  the Cold War?
27975,sam,All right. Sit down. 
27976,josh,Have you ever seen anything like this before?
27977,josh,What?
27978,josh,Under whose custody?
27979,josh, Russ...
27980,josh,I-I don't--
27981,josh,They're gonna give him a Eurail pass and a backpack?
27982,josh,"First of all, it isn't up to the governor, it's up to the DeKalb DA. Second of all...  this is Georgia."
27983,josh,"This kid shoots his teacher in the head and gets life in Venice, we're all gonna look  like idiots. I gotta put this out before it's in the papers."
27984,josh,What do I do now?
27985,josh,I wanna do it today.
27986,josh,Thank you. 
27987,c.j.,"And why would you want to buy back the bad land, too?"
27988,c.j.,"So, what you need is, what?"
27989,c.j.,I'm sure that's handled by the Department of the Interior.
27990,c.j.,And?
27991,c.j.,These things take a little bit of time.
27992,c.j.,"It's a big interior, Maggie."
27993,c.j., 15 years?
27994,c.j.,Yeah. 
27995,c.j., Yeah?
27996,c.j.,I don't think so.
27997,c.j.,I'm just talking to my friends.
27998,c.j.,"Have a good weekend, Mark. Have a good Thanksgiving."
27999,c.j.,Yours is in April?
28000,c.j.,Oh. To have it be over.
28001,josh,"I know ""The Little Red Lighthouse."" That's a great book."
28002,josh,The George Washington bridge.
28003,josh,"Yeah, you peer down just at the right moment, you can see the top of it."
28004,josh,I'll ask around.
28005,josh,Now...
28006,josh,"Well... Federal Law doesn't allow it, but people in the state of Georgia do, so there's  not much... A waiter brings by a tray of coffee and food."
28007,josh,Mr. Fedrigotti...
28008,josh,Alberto... please. You'll have the ambassador speak to the foreign minister and send the kid back?
28009,josh,Alberto...
28010,josh,The kid wasn't throwing food.
28011,josh," See, it's... it's p[problematic when other people make my argument for me."
28012,josh,Okay. I'm gonna... I'll ask around about the book.
28013,c.j., What about the assistant secretary for Indian affairs?
28014,c.j.,You tried?
28015,c.j.,Deputy Director of Intergovernmental affairs?
28016,c.j.,Deputy of Acquisition... isn't there a deputy of Acquisition and Property Management?
28017,c.j.,But?
28018,c.j.,I'm here! They're here! You're here!
28019,c.j.,Tell Leo's office I'm coming over. 
28020,sam,She's making a certain amount of sense.
28021,toby,Isn't this one of those things that can be argued from all sides?
28022,sam,Yes.
28023,toby,"And one way or another, they're all right?"
28024,sam,Yes.
28025,toby,You can put the numbers together a lot of different ways?
28026,sam,Yeah.
28027,toby,"Okay, well, let's put them together in a way that there's just fewer poor people."
28028,sam,Yeah.
28029,toby,"Or, if we have to go with the new formula, delay as long as we can - we have to test it."
28030,sam,All right. 
28031,sam,"So three statisticians go deer-hunting. The first one misses ten feet to the left,  the second one misses ten feet to the right. The third one jumps up and down and says,  'I hit it!' You got to like a guy who comes up with a statistical analysis joke.   Certainly you would if you had let me call you Bernie."
28032,sam,Shouldn't we test the math before the President signs it off? Create a pilot program and  experiment for two years?
28033,sam,Yeah.
28034,sam,"You know I've always wanted to learn how to work an abacus, 'cause on the first day when  the check comes and you pull that thing out of your pocket and start adding up the tip?"
28035,sam,"Yeah. You know, the new formula doesn't take into account regional differences in housing costs. "
28036,sam,You don't think it's worth it?
28037,sam,How do you suppose the landlords in New York and L.A. feel about the national mean?
28038,sam, So you drop the problem when the math gets tough.
28039,sam,"You know who wouldn't be very pleased by that? Ms. Holly Orshansky of Poland, author of the  original formula, who I think is long overdue for recognition."
28040,sam,Hmmm?
28041,sam,Not Holly?
28042,sam,Thought it was Holly.
28043,bartlet,Get him in here.
28044,bartlet,What the hell is this? 
28045,bartlet,What is this?
28046,bartlet, It's a poll. I asked to see a poll about certain...  doesn't matter. Then send up the wrong poll. This one asks voters where I should spend  Thanksgiving.
28047,bartlet,What the hell are you doing polling where I should spend Thanksgiving?
28048,bartlet,I have Thanksgiving with my family.
28049,bartlet,Thank god!
28050,bartlet,You politicize family to make sure they don't look political.
28051,bartlet,My family is off limits. 
28052,bartlet,"I'll decide when I've used them up. You don't poll where my family goes, am I making myself clear?"
28053,bartlet,What?
28054,bartlet,"Ah, something important!"
28055,bartlet,"The number for the Butterball Hotline.  Watch, and learn."
28056,bartlet,Hello...
28057,bartlet,Charlie!!
28058,c.j.,Fifteen years!
28059,leo,I agree. That's a long time.
28060,c.j.,That's a pretty long time.
28061,leo,Yes.
28062,c.j., And you know all we're talking about is a sewage plant and a  house center. They're not asking for the Great Plains. 
28063,leo,I'll have somebody call somebody and find out what the delay is.
28064,c.j.,What can I tell them in the meantime?
28065,leo,Tell them that.
28066,c.j.,It'd be nice if they could see someone before he left. They had an appointment.
28067,leo,Sealy?
28068,c.j.,He's gone.
28069,leo,Do it Monday.
28070,c.j.,"We do it Monday, they're gonna stay here till Monday. Absent being dragged off in handcuffs,  of this I'm sure. Plus right is right."
28071,leo,What do you want from me?
28072,c.j.,Five minutes!
28073,leo,No.
28074,c.j.,"They walk out of here, they've met with the Chief of Staff."
28075,leo,No.
28076,c.j.,Why not?
28077,leo,'Cause I'm not taking a meeting which somebody who stages a sitting in a lobby!
28078,c.j.,"All right, thank you. "
28079,leo,Thank you.
28080,bartlet,Toby!
28081,toby,"Yes, sir."
28082,bartlet,"Come in, please. "
28083,bartlet,You polled where I should have Thanksgiving?
28084,toby,"Yeah, I saw that question."
28085,bartlet,And it was okay with you?
28086,toby,"Uh, yes sir."
28087,bartlet,Why?
28088,toby,Because it was okay with Joey Lucas.
28089,bartlet,You think people should care where I have Thanksgiving?
28090,toby,I know I don't give a damn...
28091,bartlet,All right. Doesn't matter. I straightened it out. It has a lot to do with kelp.
28092,toby,What?
28093,toby,What the hell is...
28094,bartlet,Shhhh. Hello!!
28095,bartlet,"Well, first let me say, I think this is a wonderful service you provide."
28096,bartlet,I'm a citizen.
28097,bartlet," I'm Joe Betherson...sen. That's one 't', and with an 'h' in there."
28098,bartlet,Fargo.
28099,bartlet," My street address is 114... 54 Pruder Street, and it's very important  that you put 'street' down there because sometimes it gets confused with Pruder Way and  Pruder Lane. Apartment 23 R... Fargo, North Dakota... "
28100,bartlet,Zip code 50504.
28101,bartlet,I do radio commercials for... products.
28102,bartlet," Stuffing should be stuffed inside the turkey, am I correct?"
28103,bartlet,"Well, then we'd have to call it something else, wouldn't we?Toby sits down and puts his  hand under his chin."
28104,bartlet,"If I cook it inside the turkey, is there a chance I could kill my guests? I'm not saying  that's necessarily a deal-breaker."
28105,bartlet,"All right. Well, first of all, I think you made the second bacteria up, and second of all,  how do I avoid it?"
28106,bartlet,Excellent! Let's talk temperature.
28107,bartlet,"No, see, I was testing you! The USDA calls for turkeys to be cooked to an internal temperature  of 180 to 185 degrees."
28108,bartlet,Okay. Good testing!
28109,bartlet,Oh yeah. It was presented to me as a gift from the personal sous chef to the king of...   auto sales in... 
28110,toby, Fargo.
28111,bartlet,"Fargo. Phil Baharnd. The man can sell a car like... well, like anything."
28112,bartlet,"And you do, too. Thanks a lot!  That was excellent!  We should do that once a week."
28113,toby, Phil Baharnd?
28114,bartlet,I gotta get better at the names.
28115,bartlet,"No. One more thing left. Today, we find the traitor in my family. I know the First Lady  doesn't like to schlep, but would you please tell her to meet me in the residence?"
28116,josh,Look--
28117,leo,Wait--
28118,josh,I need to ask you something.
28119,leo,What?
28120,josh,"What am I missing? Why does the White House care so much about an issue involving a  local DA which, at best, should be handled by Justice and State and the Embassy?"
28121,leo,Because.
28122,josh,Because what?
28123,leo,I don't want this President to get a call from the Bishop of Rome.
28124,josh,Why do we care about the Bishop of Rome?
28125,leo,Because that's not the only name he goes by.
28126,josh, What's another name?
28127,leo,Your Holiness?
28128,josh,The Bishop of Rome is the Pope?
28129,leo,It'll take it to a whole new level. We don't wanna be on that level.
28130,josh,"No, we do not."
28131,leo,Forget the Italians... I wanna work it from our side.
28132,josh,That means getting the DA to guarantee he won't seek the death penalty.
28133,leo,Yeah.
28134,josh,How?
28135,leo,DeKalb's the Georgia 4th.
28136,josh,Yeah?
28137,leo,"When Gire was elected fom the Georgia 4th election before last, Farragut was who he beat."
28138,josh,Who's Farragut?
28139,leo,The DeKalb DA.
28140,josh," Well, I suppose there's a time for scrouples and a time for, you know."
28141,leo,Not.
28142,josh,Yeah.
28143,leo,He's left the office. But he'll be on the 8 p.m. U.S. Airways out of Hartsfield going to DFW.
28144,josh,Hartsfield?
28145,leo,Yeah.
28146,josh,Okay. 
28148,josh,Listen--
28150,josh,Cancel it.
28152,josh,I need a layover in Atlanta.
28154,josh,And I need to get there about an hour before an 8:00 flight would take off.
28156,josh," I hadn't done the math. I'm also gonna need some information on the DeKalb  County DA, whose name is Farragut. Do me a favor, start with a recent photograph.  And call my mother and tell her I'm gonna be late."
28158,josh,Yeah?
28160,josh,Right. 
28161,toby,I should be able to at least fire paintballs at you while you do that. 
28162,sam, It's harder to get elected if you feature the underclass.  It's harder to help them if you hide them.
28163,toby,"Well what if we just recaliberate it to me everyone over 20,000 rich and everyone  under 20,000 middle class?"
28164,sam,"Then they'd all vote Republican, wouldn't they?"
28165,toby, Yeah.
28166,sam,I think when we get back from the weekend we should talk to Bruno.
28167,toby,Why Bruno? 
28168,sam,"Because I think if it's anything short of a torpedo in the side of the campaign, we should  take it to Leo. I think even if it's torpedoing into the side of the campaign we should  do it,  but that's me, and I don't imagine I'd rally much support around that."
28169,toby,No.
28170,sam,So we'll take it to Bruno.
28171,toby,Yeah.
28172,sam,Thanks.
28173,toby, See you Monday.
28174,sam,Have a good Thanksgiving.
28175,toby,You too.
28176,c.j.,What?
28177,c.j.,About what?
28178,c.j.,"No, about what? It's a lawyer and a Michigan wolverine. I think we can take them.  We always do. "
28179,c.j., I'll be there in a minute.
28180,toby,Bruno.
28181,toby,You get hauled in?
28182,toby,And?
28183,toby," Listen, the OMB's gonna come out with a recommendation for a new way to  calculate the poverty level."
28184,toby,"No. But the formula raises the poverty level 2,000 in change."
28185,toby,"20,000 a year. The problem is we're without a campaign and with 4 million new poor people."
28186,toby,Yeah.
28187,toby," We're working on that one, too."
28188,toby,How?
28189,toby,What the hell are you--
28190,toby," No, I've got neices and nephews and... we'll meet Monday on this, okay?"
28191,toby,No. 
28192,josh,"Could I get a ginger ale, please? "
28193,josh,"Excuse me, you're Mark Farragut, right? I'm Josh Lyman."
28194,josh,Yeah.
28195,josh,"No, my mom lives in Florida.  But just technically."
28196,josh,Doesn't matter.
28197,josh,"The Italians aren't worried about the governor, Mark. They're worried about you."
28198,josh,You don't have a defendant.
28199,josh,I know. 'Cause the Georgia 4th is tough enough for a Democrat without appearing as  if he's against the death penalty.
28200,josh,"I said appearing. The only way to combat that is with TV time. You are planning on  running again, right?"
28201,josh,"You raised $232,000 in four months, but then the well dried up after you prosecuted a  corporate polluter and got stuck as anti-business. You were left with 41,500 for the  last two months and that was the ball game."
28202,josh,"  Guarantee you won't seek the death penalty, and you'll have endless media to explain it  to your district."
28203,josh,"Well, in a manner of speaking."
28204,josh,"Yeah, three of them. None of them local. Do it, I'm telling ya, and all three of them  will take your call."
28205,josh,Flight's boarding.
28206,josh,"You, too."
28207,josh,Thank you. 
28209,bartlet,Hi.
28212,bartlet,"Yeah, sorry about that. Listen, I'm sorry about this, too, but we have to change plans."
28214,bartlet,We're gonna have dinner here at the White House. Charlie's calling everybody.
28217,bartlet,I guess not.
28219,bartlet,It's no problem.
28221,bartlet,It's their job.
28223,bartlet,I've got polling numbers.
28226,bartlet,"J'accuse, mon petite fromage!"
28228,bartlet,Nothing's wrong with my French.
28230,bartlet, That's right!
28232,bartlet,And what part are you leaving out now?
28234,bartlet,Yes!
28236,bartlet, You know what? It was.
28238,bartlet,"Well, with the ingredients for stuffing, you have to cook them before you put them in the  turkey, and you're not gonna know whether I did or not."
28240,bartlet,"Me, too. "
28241,c.j.,How many treaties have we signed with the Munsee Indians?
28242,c.j.,How many have we revoked?
28243,c.j.,What were the Munsees doing in 1778?
28244,c.j.,And why aren't you in New York anymore?
28245,c.j.,And whose land was it in the first place.
28246,c.j.," I'm gonna have the park police escort you from the building, it'll take me a  few minutes, so you can make whatever calls you need to make. Or, you can come back to  my office right now, we'll make an appointment for Monday and the White House will cover  your expenses. "
28247,c.j.,Okay... what?
28248,c.j.," No, okay or..."
28249,c.j., How do you keep fighting these smaller injustices  when they're all from the Mother of Injustices?
28250,c.j.,Katie.
28251,c.j.,Sued?
28252,c.j.,About the President being sued?
28253,c.j.,"Okay, that's all everybody. I'll see you at five."
28254,c.j.,"You haven't heard anything about that, have you?"
28255,c.j.,About the President being sued?
28256,c.j.,What are you-?
28257,c.j.,Toby-
28258,toby,"There's a group, a veterans' group that's talking about not showing up for the anniversary."
28259,c.j.,Which group?
28260,toby,I don't know.
28261,c.j.,Why aren't they going to show up?
28262,toby,They're talking about not showing up.
28263,c.j.,Why?
28264,toby,I don't know.
28265,c.j.,Do you know anything about the President being sued?
28266,toby,No. Why?
28267,c.j.,Katie Witt seems to think there was an item in the Rocky Mountain News.
28268,toby,I thought it was the Bugler.
28269,c.j.,It's not.
28270,toby,I don't know anything about it.
28271,c.j.,Okay.
28272,toby,Ginger.
28273,toby,Have you set up a meeting for me?
28274,toby,With the veterans' group?
28275,toby,The one that's talking about not coming?
28276,toby,"You haven't yet, have you?"
28277,toby,But you will?
28278,toby,Sam?
28279,sam,The President's being sued?
28280,toby,Did you get this from the Rocky Mountain?
28281,sam,"I got this from the DoJ, civil addition. Three months ago at a fundraiser the President  was asked about airbags. Someone suggested they're more dangerous than benefits.  The President says, and I'm quoting, 'Everything has risks. Your car can drive into  a lake and your seatbelt jams, but no one's saying don't wear your seat belt.' "
28282,toby,Don't tell me!
28283,sam,"That someone thought that's what he was saying? A couple at the fundraiser got into an  accident. He wasn't wearing his seat belt, he died. She's suing for contributory negligence."
28284,toby,You can't sue the President.
28285,sam,You can get rich trying to figure out how. We should do something preemptive.
28286,toby,It's not going to be a big deal.
28287,sam,Isn't that what we say right before something becomes a big deal?
28288,bartlet, Toby!
28289,toby,Yes?
28290,sam,"Good morning, sir."
28291,toby,"Morning, Mr. President."
28292,bartlet,"Come with me for a second, would you?"
28293,toby,"Sir, it's possible you're going to hear some stuff about seatbelts today. I urge you to  ignore it."
28294,bartlet,No problem. Are you straightening things out with the Smithsonian?
28295,toby,Today.
28296,bartlet,"I'm supposed to speak at the opening of an exhibit marking the sixtieth anniversary  of Pearl Harbor, but there's a small veterans' group that objects to the exhibit on  the grounds that it's America bashing."
28297,toby,I wouldn't say that.
28298,toby,I wouldn't.
28299,toby,"Sir, you needed me?"
28300,bartlet,"Frank, what was added?"
28301,toby,This is Qumar?
28302,bartlet,Yeah
28303,toby,"There's no way I'll remember that, can you send someone a memo?"
28304,toby,This is in exchange for a five-year lease.
28305,bartlet,The point is that we've dotted the I's and we're ready to announce.
28306,toby,I'll let C.J. know.
28307,bartlet,Let C.J. know but have her pass it off to the DoD.
28308,toby,You want to bury it?
28309,bartlet,Not totally.
28310,toby,But passing it off to another department is usually our way of signaling we don't want  the public to care about it.
28311,bartlet,"I don't know, every time we make one of these deals with a place like Qumar I feel  the women around here look at me funny."
28312,toby,I think you're probably wrong about that.
28313,bartlet,You think it's just guilt?
28314,toby,"Yes, sir."
28315,bartlet,Well how should I deal with guilt?
28316,toby,Be more like me.
28317,bartlet," Yeah, okay."
28318,toby,"Anything else, sir?"
28319,bartlet,"C.J.'s going to be cool with this, right?"
28320,toby,C.J.'s the one you're worried about?
28321,bartlet,"I'm just saying she knows who the good guys are, right?"
28322,toby,Yeah.
28323,bartlet,"Okay, thanks."
28324,toby,"Thank you, Mr. President."
28325,bartlet,What's next?
28327,josh,Could I get five minutes without being interrupted by banality?
28329,josh," Morning, ma'am."
28331,josh, A little head's up wouldn't be out of line.
28333,josh,"What can I do for you, ma'am?"
28335,josh,"Yeah, I was cc'd on that letter."
28337,josh," Amy Gardner's always irate about something, I wouldn't give it a  lot of thought."
28339,josh,"Me too, and I think it deserves a lot of thought."
28341,josh,I was kidding.
28343,josh,"Honestly, ma'am, due respect, I think they're overreacting. We're talking about one word."
28345,josh,I don't know how dramatically...
28347,josh,Yes.
28349,josh,"Well, I suppose that's for prosecutors to..."
28351,josh,You've spoken with her?
28353,josh,God.... Really? 
28355,josh,Yes I am.
28357,josh, Thank you ma'am.
28358,leo,Thanks for waiting.
28359,leo,How you doing?
28360,leo,And why are we here?
28361,leo,And?
28362,leo,Mad cow?
28363,leo,But we think?
28364,leo,Worst case scenario?
28365,leo,Twelve thousand out of how many?
28366,leo,Somebody needs to teach me about this.
28367,c.j.,What's next?
28368,c.j.,What's he say?
28369,c.j.,A pig-picking festival?
28370,c.j.,More and more I'm in favor of English being the national language.
28371,c.j.,Named after him?
28372,c.j.,"Thank you, Santa. How about...?"
28373,toby,It's pretty hard to get at the pork when the Chairman's hogging the trough.
28374,c.j.,What else?
28375,toby,You better be briefed on the arms sale to Qumar cause the Pentagon leaked it.
28376,c.j.,Qumar?
28377,toby,Yeah
28378,c.j.,In the Gulf?
28379,toby,No. We lease an air base in Qumar. It's a ten-year lease and it's up and they won't  renew without an arms package. Are you writing this down?
28380,c.j.,"No, when did we make an arms deal with Qumar?"
28381,toby,I really don't know. What does it matter?
28382,c.j.,What does it matter?
28383,toby,Yeah
28384,c.j.,What are we selling?
28385,toby,Don't start...
28386,c.j.,What are we selling?
28387,toby, What are we selling?
28388,c.j.,Don't start?! What the hell...?
28389,c.j.,Anything else?
28390,c.j.,Thank you.
28391,sam,This is how it starts.
28392,toby,What?
28393,sam,Trouble. This is how trouble starts.
28394,toby,Seat belts?
28395,sam,Contributory negligence in a wrongful death is the tort equivalent of murder.
28396,toby,And aren't lawsuits against the President the tort equivalent of insane?
28397,sam,Toby...
28398,toby,Like the guy who's suing the President to stop CIA-sponsored radio transmissions  in his bridgework?
28399,sam,Yes
28400,toby,Or the guy who's suing to have the man from the planet Xanadu removed from his front yard?
28401,sam,That's not local?
28402,toby,It's federal. There's the couple suing for repayment of all back taxes ever because taxes  are unconstitutional.
28403,sam,Technically they are.
28404,toby,Sam...
28405,sam,They're not.
28406,toby,And the bow-tie manufacturer from the garment district who blames the falling market on  the fact that the President doesn't wear bow-ties.
28407,sam,There's a reason the civil division gave us a heads-up.
28408,toby,What?
28409,sam,This one could break. One random comment and that's the ball game. Thank you for coming  to Dodger Stadium.
28410,toby,You think murder is going to overtake education and health care on the campaign trail?
28411,sam,"No, you're right, because health care and education are much sexier."
28412,toby,What do you suggest?
28413,sam,That we come out right now for a national seatbelt law.
28414,toby,"Wait, wait, better yet. Why doesn't he set up his own checkpoint on I-95?"
28415,sam,Cause that's impractical.
28416,toby, So's twisting national policy over a non-story.
28417,sam, It's not going to be a non-story.
28418,sam,No.
28419,bartlet,Hey.
28420,bartlet,Did the Celtics win last night?
28421,bartlet,"Okay, when I say did they win, you can just say yes or no."
28422,bartlet,What are you doing?
28423,bartlet,"I'm not on you, I'm just asking."
28424,bartlet,Modern American history sucks.
28425,bartlet,"You want to study history, study the Crusades, the fall of the Roman Empire from  Theoddoseus to Justinian."
28426,bartlet,Damn right the Visigoths. Modern history's another name for television.
28427,bartlet,Is there any way I can help?
28428,bartlet,"I'm a master of modern history, you can ask me anything."
28429,bartlet, I don't know.
28430,leo, Good morning.
28431,bartlet,They said you needed to see me.
28432,leo,Yeah.
28433,bartlet,What's going on?
28434,leo,I'm going to tell you.
28435,c.j.,"Good morning, Mr. President."
28436,bartlet,Hey.
28437,leo,"Sir, at this moment we're waiting to hear from the UK on confirmation of a test for mad cow."
28438,bartlet,"Oh man, they got it again?"
28439,leo,"No, sir. I mean a US case."
28440,bartlet, A US case?
28441,leo,Yeah. Right now it's what's called a presumptive positive. England will come back with  definitive answers.
28442,bartlet,How long?
28443,leo,72 hours.
28444,bartlet,Do we say anything in the meantime?
28445,leo,That's my question.  That's why you're here.
28446,c.j.,"I think we have to. I put the Secretary in the briefing room with experts from the  University of Maryland, the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, they lay out  the facts, soften up the ground."
28447,leo,"No, in three days we have our facts straight, we can make a full disclosure."
28448,c.j.,In the meanwhile...
28449,leo,"In the meanwhile, the USDA takes the time for tracing, checking feed logs, herd movements.  We don't know how many herds are going to need to be quarantined."
28450,c.j.,We also don't know how many people know about this already.
28451,leo,Nobody knows.
28452,c.j.,"There's at least a rancher who knows, the labs in Iowa and England, whoever the USDA..."
28453,leo,"They're our labs in Iowa, and the rancher doesn't have any interest in telling the world  his cattle are sick."
28454,bartlet,"Yeah, we got to wait."
28455,c.j.,Sir...
28456,bartlet,"The second we say positive, beef futures collapse, and we lose 3.6 billion in beef exports.  Fast food is deserted, supermarkets pull beef, it's panic - I want to talk to some more  people, but in the meantime, we wait."
28457,leo,"Thank you, sir."
28458,c.j.,"Thank you, Mr. President."
28459,c.j.,Want to see panic?
28460,leo,Hang on...
28461,c.j.,"Want to see panic, let the story break on CNN."
28462,leo,Waiting buys us time to get some reassuring answers.
28463,c.j.,I don't know how many more times we can get caught keeping a secret.
28464,leo,Sometimes that's what we're supposed to do.
28465,c.j., All right.
28466,leo,Thanks.
28467,c.j., Listen.
28468,leo,Yeah.
28469,c.j.,"Not for nothing, but three weeks ago a woman in Qumar was executed for adultery. She didn't  need a lawyer 'cause there wasn't any trial, it was her husband's word against hers."
28470,leo,Yeah.
28471,c.j.,Later today I'm going to be announcing that we're selling them tanks and guns.
28472,c.j.,Okay.
28473,josh,Thanks. 
28474,josh,This is interesting art on the walls. A lot of very strong women who could hurt me.
28475,josh,Yeah.
28476,josh,Amy.
28477,josh,Yeah.
28478,josh,No.
28479,josh,Good.
28480,josh,A map of global trafficking in prostitution?
28481,josh,Amerigo Vespucci?
28482,josh,"It's your State Department, too, Amy."
28483,josh,"Yeah, every time you write a letter to the First Lady she gets into gear because she  feels guilty that she's not doing enough for women."
28484,josh,And what would you like?
28485,josh,Not half as glad as I am.
28486,josh,Yes.
28487,josh,Yeah.
28488,josh,Yeah
28489,josh,How is that not forced prostitution?
28490,josh,Not enough.
28491,josh, What the hell are those?
28492,josh,I'm sorry?
28493,josh,Are they abstract?
28494,josh,We can't drop the one word.
28495,josh,"Because we're not the only ones living in the world. Prostitution is legal in Germany,  Turkey, the Netherlands, and if we alienate these countries..."
28496,josh,The more countries who sign the treaty the more effective it is.
28497,josh,That's a permeating syllogism to be sure .
28498,josh,Who else are you going to vote for?
28499,josh,Amy...
28500,josh,All right.
28501,josh,Yeah.
28502,josh,The art around here scares the hell out of me.
28503,toby,Good morning. Thanks for waiting.
28504,toby,Good to see you.
28505,toby,Tell me why I'm talking to you.
28506,toby,And why is that making veterans unhappy?
28507,toby,"They're not attending anymore, they're boycotting."
28508,toby,"Well, the President's speaking at the opening, so it's a bit of a problem because these  guys aren't going to keep their unhappiness to themselves. I don't care if there are  2,000 or 20, I don't want the President where there are pissed-off veterans."
28509,toby,Tell me what they're going to tell me when I meet with them this afternoon.
28510,toby,Which is?
28511,toby,The commentary.
28512,toby,And you say so in the commentary?
28513,toby,Yeah
28514,toby,"How about the exhibit titled ""America's Vengeance?"""
28515,toby,"""Vengeance"" is pretty provocative, especially when followed by the burnt contents of a  child's lunch box? Of course I've reviewed the material."
28516,leo,"Excuse me, I'm sorry, do you have a moment?"
28517,toby,Yeah.
28518,leo,I want to you to get with C.J. when you can.
28519,toby,Sure. Why?
28520,leo,A lab in the UK is going to let us know in 72 hours if the first US case of mad cow is  in Nebraska right now. We got a presumptive positive on-
28521,toby,72 hours?
28522,leo,Yeah.
28523,toby,We should keep it to ourselves.
28524,leo,That's what I think. C.J. disagrees. The President wants to hear more.
28525,toby,Okay.
28526,leo,Thanks.
28527,sam,Leo.
28528,leo,Yeah.
28529,sam,"You know the President's being sued, right?"
28530,leo,I'm sorry?
28531,sam,The President's being sued.
28532,leo,"Oh, the guy from the Planet Zanzibar."
28533,sam,"Xanadu. No, the seatbelts."
28534,leo,"Yeah, I saw. That's not going to be anything."
28535,sam,"The Washington Times' running it under the headline ""Bartlet Accused of Contributory  Negligence."""
28536,leo,I didn't know The Washington Times could spell all those words.
28537,sam,"Yep, A-29 above the fold."
28538,leo,There's a fold that deep in the paper?
28539,sam,"Look, after three, four, five days, it's going to be picked up by the Post and the  New York Times. Let's be ahead of it."
28540,leo,How?
28541,sam,Come out for a national seatbelt law.
28542,leo,A national seatbelt law's never going to happen.
28543,sam,Why?
28544,leo,What's the most important State in the primaries?
28545,sam,New Hampshire.
28546,leo,What's the most important State in the general?
28547,sam,Michigan.
28548,leo,What's the only State without a mandatory seatbelt law?
28549,sam,New Hampshire.
28550,leo,And where do they make the cars?
28551,sam,Fair enough. Can I explore it?
28552,leo,"Knock yourself out. In fact, go ahead and knock yourself out."
28553,sam,Yeah.
28554,josh,It's bluster. The appointments aren't going to be held up. At least not by Lady Godiva.
28556,josh,"No, she was, yeah. I'm saying, if she wants to front off it's not like there's a moral  imperative for the White House to get behind, what?"
28558,josh,Equity and insurance coverage for contraception or whatever it is the ladies want.  More money for sewing notions and whatnot.
28560,josh,"If she wants to throw heat, we can hold back a few months on the backing for the  Child Support Enforcement Act."
28562,josh,"Of course I don't want to do that, Donna, I'm a friend of the working mom."
28564,josh,I do.
28566,josh,Yeah.
28568,josh,No. Why? Why?
28570,josh,That's ridiculous.
28572,josh,That we condone prostitution?
28574,josh,It can't be spun that way.
28576,josh,You think it can?
28578,josh,"All right. All right, would you check if C.J.'s in her office?"
28579,toby,"Well I don't know what 'me of all people' means, but..."
28580,toby,I'm not. This is different from the NEA.
28581,toby,"It is. For one thing, the President's being asked to speak, which is the only reason  I can have you sitting here in the first place. Listen, uh, something's come up, and  I'm done if you're done, so..."
28582,toby,I appreciate yours. Can I call later today?
28583,c.j.,Yeah?
28584,josh,How you doing?
28585,c.j.,Fine.
28586,josh,So I just came from seeing Amy Gardner.
28587,c.j.,"Yeah, how'd it go?"
28588,josh,I showed her who's boss.
28589,c.j.,Who'd it turn out to be?
28590,josh,"It's still unclear, but let me ask you something. The UN treaty, Vienna. If we have to  make a to-do about it being forced prostitution, isn't there a chance it could be spun  that we're condoning prostitution?"
28591,c.j.,Yeah.
28592,josh,How much of a chance?
28593,c.j.,It'll happen.
28594,josh,Cause Amy'll make it happen.
28595,c.j.,Yeah.
28596,josh,"Well, this is a whole new thing then..."
28597,toby, Leo told me.
28598,c.j.,Close the door.
28599,josh,Told you what?
28600,c.j.,Close the door. 
28601,c.j.,There was a presumptive positive on some cattle in Nebraska.
28602,josh,What does that mean?
28603,c.j.,We have to wait 72 hours for a test.
28604,josh,You're talking about a disease?
28605,c.j.,Yeah.
28606,josh,You're kidding me.
28607,c.j.,No.
28608,josh,Mad cow?
28609,c.j.,Yeah.
28610,josh,"Oh my god, you're kidding me!"
28611,c.j.,"Really, no."
28612,josh,I guess if the door's closed we're not saying anything yet?
28613,toby,That's what we're here to talk about.
28614,josh,What do you think?
28615,c.j.,You know we have an extra 1.5 billion dollars we weren't counting on?
28616,toby,What?
28617,c.j.,"There's an extra 1.5 billion. In Qumar, when a woman gets raped, she'll generally get  beaten by her husband and sons as a punishment so at some point we should talk about  how to spend the 1.5 billion they're giving us."
28618,c.j.,"Okay, so, should we tell anybody?"
28619,bartlet, All right. Unfunded mandates.
28620,leo,This is where the federal government forces localities to do stuff that isn't at all  interested in paying the bill.
28621,bartlet,Don't give me their grumbles.
28622,bartlet,Are employees in wheelchairs supposed to work in the parking lot?
28623,bartlet,How much would it cost the federal government to amend the unfunded mandates we format  to cover all unfunded mandates?
28624,bartlet,Let's find out for sure then tell Siegel to sit down and shut up.
28625,leo,Anything else?
28626,bartlet,No.
28627,bartlet,"So paint a picture for me, would you?"
28628,leo,"We find the source of the problem, which'll be the feed. We buy the cattle and slaughter them."
28629,bartlet,How many?
28630,leo,Tens of thousands.
28631,bartlet,That's the live cattle. What about the beef?
28632,leo,"Well, FSIS will do a Class One recall and get it off the shelves. Not that they need to.  Nobody's gonna buy beef for a couple of years."
28633,bartlet,That's a hundred and fifty billion dollar industry. What's the West going to do for a living?
28634,leo,Well this generation of ranchers is done. They won't get back on their feet.
28635,bartlet,People have known about this disease; they're still eating beef in record numbers.
28636,leo,"That's cause it's been on the other side of the ocean. Once we announce a positive,  steak houses are done. Fast food is done."
28637,bartlet,"And then the corn and soybean growers, right?"
28638,leo,The dominos don't end on this.
28639,bartlet,Any good news?
28640,leo,For fishermen.
28641,bartlet,"So we've got frightened parents, rising food prices, public panic, massive layoffs,  and something we've never had to worry about before, we're wondering when the next  case is gonna happen. The most costly disruptions..."
28642,leo,Yeah?
28643,bartlet,Always happen when something we take completely for granted stops working for a minute.
28644,leo,Yeah.
28645,bartlet, Okay.
28646,leo," Thank you, Mr. President."
28647,bartlet,"Oh, hey - do you know when we passed the Clean Water Act?"
28648,leo,No.
28649,bartlet,How could you not know that?
28650,leo,"My water's clean, I don't ask questions."
28651,bartlet,What'd I just say?
28652,leo,I wasn't really listening.
28653,bartlet, All right.
28654,leo,Thank you. 
28655,bartlet,"Nope, nothing."
28656,bartlet,No. 
28657,bartlet,"You know, Charlie..."
28658,bartlet,History can't be reduced to dates and names.
28659,bartlet,"Nah. I'm starting you out with a copy of the speech George Perkins March used in 1845  to rouse the agricultural community of Rutland, Vermont. Then you're going to need to  study on the word ""ecology,"" as coined by the German biologist Ernst Heikl."
28660,bartlet," Better in the original German, of course, but obviously the  translation will be fine."
28661,sam,Hey.
28662,sam,Good. Thanks for coming down. Come on back.
28663,sam,Well he didn't tell people not to wear their seatbelts.
28664,sam, That's a good one. He can use it at the Rotary Club.
28665,sam,He feels bad about that.
28666,sam,He's gonna apologize.
28667,sam,My dad's an Elk.
28668,sam,"So. Anticipating this might become a thing, I wanted to float the idea of a national  seatbelt law. What's the Democratic Leadership going to say?"
28669,sam,Why?
28670,sam,"Well, you know, I think it's about more than damage control. Only 68% of drivers are  wearing their seatbelts. We get that up to 90% and we save 5,000 lives a year."
28671,sam,Who?
28672,sam,"He really is gonna apologize, Tom."
28673,sam,"Look, secondary seatbelt laws don't work. You can only fine someone if you've stopped  them for something else. Isn't it time for a tough law?"
28674,sam,The governors don't have a vote in Congress.
28675,sam,"Okay, well then, this is a shorter meeting than I thought it would be. Thanks."
28676,sam,Yeah. 
28677,josh,Yeah?
28679,josh,My tax dollars hard at work.
28681,josh,"Say Donna, you've worked as a prostitute."
28683,josh,Let's just say.
28685,josh,Why should what you do be against the law?
28687,josh,"You're not selling yourself, you're renting out your body. "
28689,josh,Don't fashion models do it every day?
28691,josh,"It's only different because we say it's different. When you get a massage, isn't it just  a matter of degrees?"
28693,josh,Wouldn't legalizing prostitution allow women to unionize and get access to social services  and health care benefits and create some control over the industry?
28695,josh, Hmm.
28697,josh,The rare valid point.
28699,toby,"Okay, round two. I'm Toby Ziegler, I'll be your referee."
28700,toby,Yes.
28701,toby,Welcome to the White House.
28702,toby,It's nice to meet you.
28703,toby,"I don't think the President is available for pictures today, but I can check."
28704,toby,Leave me his information on a piece of paper. I can make a phone call for you.
28705,toby,Okay. Tell me the point you find most offensive and would like to see pulled from the exhibit.
28706,toby,What's at the top of the list?
28707,toby,Well you don't want to ignore the effects of the bomb.
28708,toby,"The 63,000?"
28709,toby,"Well there's some evidence to suggest that Marshall told Truman that and some estimates  say 150,000. Some say 268,000."
28710,c.j.,There are discrepancies.
28711,toby,I didn't see you there. 
28712,toby,This is C.J. Cregg.
28713,c.j.,Good to meet you.
28714,toby,You need anything?
28715,c.j.,I just came by to listen.
28716,toby," Before I forget, I want to put you three in a room with  the exhibit directors from the Smithsonian. Can I do it today?"
28717,toby,Stay by a phone.  Okay.
28718,c.j.,"Can I interrupt for a second, Toby?"
28719,toby,Yeah.
28720,c.j.,"Mr. Ramsey, I saw on your information you were in the 10th Armored Division."
28721,c.j.,"You fought in the battle of the bulge, sir."
28722,c.j.,That was a hell of a moment.
28723,c.j.,Can I ask you to imagine something?
28724,c.j.,"Imagine if you weren't as successful as you were. Imagine, say, that Hitler had taken  Antwerp and we'd lost the Battle of the Bulge and Germany held the western front."
28725,c.j.,"No, but even if the Russians had kicked them out of Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria, they could  have held onto France, maybe kept Italy, certainly they could have defended Germany."
28726,c.j.,"Now it's six decades later, and while they didn't conquer Europe the Nazis exist as a  recognized government in some small corner of the European union."
28727,c.j.,Really?
28728,c.j.,We did it in Cambodia.
28729,toby,"C.J., knock it off."
28730,c.j.,"You're protesting because you think the Smithsonian isn't paying proper respect to what  you and the soldiers of the 10th Armored, 3rd Army risked and lost your lives for six  decades ago. How would you feel, in the hypothetical I just described, if I told you that  at my press briefing at the end of the day I was announcing that we were selling tanks,  missiles, and fighter jets to the Nazis?"
28731,toby,Excuse me.  Step outside.
28732,toby,Look...
28733,c.j.,"You know, if I was living in Qumar I wouldn't be able to say ""Shove it up your ass, Toby.""  But since I'm not, shove it up your ass, Toby."
28734,bartlet,You really wanna talk about the lawsuit in Colorado?
28735,sam,"Yes, sir."
28736,bartlet,"You hear about the lawyer who opened a chain of dry cleaners? ""Press your lawsuit while  you wait?""  There was a better joke in there someplace, right?"
28737,sam,Probably not. 
28738,sam,Sir--
28739,bartlet,Doctrine of Sovereign Immunity. You can't sue the king. We brought it over from England.
28740,sam,"Yeah, but he's not immune from the court of public opinion."
28741,bartlet,Forgot to bring that one over.
28742,sam,The RNC'll have a press conference.
28743,bartlet,The RNC has a press conference when I sneeze.
28744,sam,I think we need to come out for a strong national seatbelt law.
28745,bartlet,Congress won't pass it.
28746,sam,I'm not saying we need to have a law. I'm just saying we need to come out for it. It'll end  the question of where you stand.
28747,bartlet,"People know where I stand. If they don't know, they can ask me."
28748,sam,"You were governor of New Hampshire, sir, the only state--"
28749,bartlet,"And I was for it then. Never did anything about it because nobody wanted it. And, frankly,  why waste time in Capitol?"
28750,sam,C.J.'ll get asked about it at the five o'clock briefing.
28751,bartlet,I can't be responsible every time somebody irrationally twists my meaning. People are  responsible for themselves. 
28752,bartlet,"Today's cars are safer than they've ever been. They've all got air bags, they've all got  seatbelts, and they're all crash tested from here to Tuesday. All that's left is personal  behavior and bad luck, and, I'm not responsible for either one. And, Sam, if Mrs. Landingham w as here right now, she'd say the exact same thing. You know what I'm saying?"
28753,sam,"Yes, sir."
28754,bartlet,"I don't blame this woman for suing me. I'm not a king, and I'm not sure the law should  treat me like one. Though certainly for the moment I don't mind. I'm not blaming her.  She's got to go someplace with her grief and her anger. The ones who should be horsewhipped  with a horsewhip are the ones exploiting her grief for political gain, and I'm not getting  down with those guys."
28755,sam,"Yes, sir."
28756,bartlet, Let Congress pass that law. I'll sign it.
28757,bartlet," Yeah, let's go. Get Leo."
28758,sam,"Thank you, Mr. President. "
28759,bartlet,Thank you. 
28760,toby,"Good evening, Mr. President."
28761,bartlet,Isn't there a joke to be had with lawsuits and dry cleaners? I've been working on it all day.
28762,josh,"You've been working on other stuff though too, right?"
28763,bartlet,Yeah. 
28764,c.j.,"Good evening, sir."
28765,bartlet,Hey.
28766,leo,Okay.
28767,bartlet,"Okay, what do we think? When do you tell the public what you know?"
28768,c.j.,I think it's right now.
28769,toby,And I think it's when you know something. I think absolute confirmation has to be the rule  when we're talking about public panic.
28770,josh,"Are we sure there's gonna be public panic if we're only saying there's a chance? We think  maybe, usually it's negative."
28771,toby,"I do. 'Cause we're not talking about sushi, it's hamburgers. I'm not kidding around,  it's... these things. The everyday things. The everyday American things. The 99 cent things  that, when you suddenly have to be afraid of them, strike at the center of our equilibrium."
28772,leo,I'll tell you what else. Democrats aren't exactly loved by the beef industry to begin with.  We're gonna get killed for causing false panic.
28773,c.j.,"Yeah, what we say now is gonna be measured against the facts, the consequenses of which will  be far worse if we don't say anything and it goes the other way."
28774,toby,I disagree.
28775,c.j., Then pretend for a moment that the cow has MS.
28776,toby,"No, I don't think I will."
28777,bartlet, Something going on with them?
28778,leo,I think they can hear you. They're standing right in front of you.
28779,c.j.,"That was a bad analogy, I apologize. What I meant was that the public will not forgive a  President who withheld information that could have helped them or saved lives. Second,  in a crisis, people need to feel like soldiers, not victims. Third, information breeds  confidence. Silence breeds fear. That's my argument. "
28780,bartlet, If it comes from the President--
28781,toby,It shouldn't come from the President.
28782,leo,It shouldn't even come from the White House.
28783,josh,It should come from Health and Human Services.
28784,leo,"How about the secretary, mid-level?"
28785,bartlet,"All right, that's what we'll do then."
28786,bartlet,Toby. 
28787,bartlet,What's going on with the Smithsonian?
28788,toby,"It'll be fine, sir. "
28789,bartlet,Where are you leading them?
28790,toby,"Not to turn a blind eye to the dark points of history, for sure, but I think there's a  time and place for that, and this isn't it."
28791,bartlet,You're changing.
28792,toby,"No, I'm not."
28793,bartlet,"Yes, you are."
28794,toby,"A very, very little bit."
28795,bartlet,Okay.
28796,toby,"Uh, Mr. President? Could you point me in the right direction on something? One of the vets  who was here has a buddy whose wheelchair's falling apart. Who can get something done  overnight at Medicaid?"
28797,bartlet,"Ah, Toby. We've gotta straighten out Medicaid."
28798,toby,Yeah.
28799,bartlet,"You know, after the Civil War, veterans had to come to D.C. to get their pensions? They had  to visit the office personally. They waited for a clerk to look through all the Civil War  records until their papers were found. You know what their papers were bound with?"
28800,toby,No.
28801,bartlet,Red tape. That's where it comes from.
28802,toby,I didn't know that.
28803,bartlet,Go and apologize to C.J. for whatever you did. 
28804,toby,I didn't do anything.
28805,bartlet,Like that matters.
28806,toby,"Thank you, sir. "
28807,bartlet,What's next? 
28808,bartlet,What?
28809,bartlet,What? 
28810,bartlet,"It was interesting, but what?"
28811,bartlet,I forgot.
28812,bartlet,"Hey, I forgot. Get the information from Toby, I'll make the call myself."
28813,bartlet,Get the information. Get the director of the CMSO on the phone.
28814,bartlet,1972.
28815,bartlet,Is when we passed the Clean Water Act.
28816,bartlet,You know nothing about the Visigoths.
28817,bartlet,And I know everything.
28818,josh,Hey.
28819,josh,"I went up to your office, and they said you were here. Eleanor Roosevelt once made a  speech to the UN General Assembly saying that we should decriminalize prostitution."
28820,josh, The Undersecretary for Global Affairs and Regina Pierce are gonna sit  with our legal advisor at the UN and look at some alternative language.
28821,josh,So.
28822,josh,That's right.
28823,josh,How's making prostitution illegal not supressing women's rights?
28824,josh,"It is, but heroin's bad for you."
28825,josh,How am I not supposed to call you a hypocrite when you say that the government shouldn't  tell women what to do with their bodies.
28826,josh,But the profit goes to the women.
28827,josh,But the guys who breaks into my apartment and steals my stereo does it for the same reason.
28828,josh,"Yeah, because he broke into my apartment and stole my stereo, and nobody wants that to  happen to them. But you can't say that about the other thing. "
28829,josh,"Forget, for a second, that it's a women's issue. The law isn't a deterrent.  Prostitutes advertise in the yellow pages."
28830,josh,Aren't we just serving to create more criminals in a criminal environment?
28831,josh,Yes?
28832,josh,To tell you about the thing.
28833,josh,Yeah.
28834,josh,I didn't know that.
28835,josh,I'm sorry?
28836,josh,Your office is on the way home.
28837,josh,Yeah.
28838,josh,I just stopped by.
28839,josh,No.
28840,josh,I'm not.
28841,josh,She's my assistant.
28842,josh,No.
28843,josh,I know.
28844,josh,Why are we talking about this?
28845,josh,I'm a visible guy. People say things about me. People write things. And what I do reflects  on the President.
28846,josh,I didn't make that up.
28847,josh,What's the thing about guys like me? 
28848,josh, What's the thing with guys like me?
28849,josh, I have to go.
28850,josh,Taxi! 
28851,josh,What the hell?!
28852,josh," What are you, fifteen years old? You almost hit me in the head!"
28853,c.j.,Hey Nancy.
28854,c.j.,"Well, this isn't the point, but we will. Of course we will. Of course we'll be fighting  a war with Qumar one day, and you know it, so...well, at least we'll be familiar with the  weapons they're using."
28855,c.j.,"We don't need it, it's convenient."
28856,c.j.,"We don't need it. We've got Turkey, we've got Bahraine, we've got Deigo Garcia.  Qumar's convenient."
28857,c.j.,"They beat women, Nancy. They hate women. The only reason they keep Qumari women alive  is to make more Qumari men."
28858,c.j.,"How about instead of suggesting that we sell the guns to them, suggesting that we shoot  the guns at them? And by the way, not to change the subject, but how are we supposed to  have any moral credibility when we talk about gun control and making sure that guns don't  get in the hands of the wrong people? God, Nancy! What the hell are we defining as the  right people?"
28859,c.j.,"I know about the real world, and I'm not suggesting we isolate them."
28860,c.j.,I have a briefing.
28861,c.j.,I'm not suggesting anything. I don't suggest foreign policy around here.
28862,c.j.,"It's the twenty-first century, Nancy. The world's gotten smaller. I don't know how we can  tolerate this kind of suffering anymore, particularly when all it does is continue the cycle  of anti-American hatred. But that's not the point, either."
28863,c.j.,"The point is that apartheid was an Easthampton clambake compared to what we laughingly refer  to as the life these women lead. And if we had sold M1-A1s to South Africa fifteen years ago,  you'd have set the building on fire. Thank God we never needed to refuel in Johannesburg!"
28864,c.j.," They're beating the women, Nancy!"
28865,c.j.,"Good evening. We have two birthdays today, so we have cake. One cake. It's nice to share.  Quickly, before I take questions, a late edition to Monday's schedule, the President will be  at the opening of the Smithsonian exhibit commemorating the sixtieth anniversary of the  attack on Pearl Harbor. That's three in the afternoon, and I'll have more information  Monday morning. Labor Secretary Carl Reed will brief from this podium in one hour's time  on our school-to-work initiative, and, let me check, yeah, while that's going on, there'll  be a briefing at the Department of Health and Human services by USDA director David Rhinegold.  Sometime Tuesday you'll be briefed at the Pentagon. The DOD will be annoucing that we've  renewed our lease another ten years with the Khalifa Airbase in Qumar. I understand they've  promised to paint and add new carpet. "
28866,c.j.,A delegation from... 
28867,leo,"Mike, come on in. "
28868,leo,"Yeah. Margaret, could you...? "
28869,leo,"Yeah. So, listen, there were more threats? "
28870,leo,How many guys do you have on the ground? 
28871,leo,Has the Governor been briefed? 
28872,leo,"All right, listen. I got to be here; I'm stuck with this thing. Will you stay with  Josh today? "
28873,leo,And can you do me a favor and get me a secure phone hookup so I can monitor this  thing? All I've got is the cell. 
28874,leo,Go.  Josh. 
28875,josh,New threats were made in Tennessee this morning. 
28876,leo,Mike Casper was just here. He's going to be with you today. 
28877,josh,Good. 
28878,leo,You'll be all right? 
28879,josh,Yeah. 
28880,leo,'Cause I got to be here all day. It's going to take all day. 
28881,josh,"Yeah, keep your head there, would you? Don't call during every break and check in.  Keep your head there. "
28882,leo,I'll keep my head where I want. 
28883,josh,Leo? 
28884,leo,Yeah. 
28885,josh,There are ways. 
28886,leo,Don't start again. 
28887,josh,There are ways to get the guy out of the room. 
28888,leo,"Hey, I'll keep my head here. You keep your head there, hmm? "
28889,josh,"I used to do this for a living, Leo. The guy gets the floor for five minutes. I can  get him out of the room. "
28890,leo,Don't help me. 
28891,josh,"I'm going to help you, 'cause you know why? "
28892,leo,'Cause you walk around with so much guilt about everybody you love dying that you're  a compulsive fixer? 
28893,josh,"No, Leo, no. It's 'cause a guy is walking down the street and he falls into a hole, see. "
28894,leo,Yeah. 
28895,josh,Yeah. 
28896,leo,"It's my day, Josh. I got to take the hit. "
28897,josh,Leo- 
28898,leo,I'll see you. 
28899,leo,You want to go and get breakfast or something? 
28900,leo,Breakfast is my favorite meal to eat out. I love tomato juice. 
28901,leo,They can wait. 
28902,leo,"Yeah, they really can. Seven new threats on black churches; the Governor's coming up;  we might have to federalize the Tennessee National Guard; and that's just the stuff  I know about that's going to happen, and here I am today. "
28903,leo,"I swear to God, Jordan, the last thing I am right now is nervous. "
28904,leo, Did I win a Grammy for something? 
28905,leo,No. 
28906,leo,"Well, those things are so political. "
28907,leo,"There's lots of things I haven't told you, Jordan. "
28908,leo,"Good morning, sir. "
28909,bartlet," Listen, I don't care that much about your ass but if you need to perjure  yourself to protect me you're going to damn well do it. "
28910,leo,"Sir, this isn't a secure call, so I'm going to say to the 17 global intelligence  agencies that are listening in that he was kidding just then. "
28911,bartlet,"Whatever it is Josh does, you're going to let him do it. "
28912,leo,I don't need Josh- 
28913,bartlet,"Yeah, yeah. How does she look to you? "
28914,leo,Who? 
28915,bartlet,Her. 
28916,leo,She looks good. 
28917,bartlet,What's she wearing? 
28918,leo, What are you wearing? 
28919,leo,Why don't you ask the President that? 
28920,leo, Spandex. 
28921,bartlet,I like you and her. It's like a '50s screwball comedy 
28922,leo,You're like a '50s screwball- 
28923,bartlet,What was that? 
28924,leo,Nothing. We should do gifts and charitable donations tomorrow night. 
28925,bartlet,I'm not doing anything tomorrow night. 
28926,leo,What's tomorrow night? 
28927,bartlet,It's Christmas Eve. 
28928,leo,"I forgot, and you don't work then, right? "
28929,bartlet,"Yeah. Actually, nobody does. "
28930,leo,"All right, the Governor is going to be there at noon but I'll be talking to you  before then. "
28931,bartlet,You got about a thousand people in this building standing with you right now. 
28932,leo,I'll be back when I'm done. 
28933,bartlet,Okay. 
28934,leo," I solemnly swear that  the testimony today will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so  help me God. "
28935,leo,Leo Thomas McGarry. 
28936,leo,We've never met. 
28937,leo,Good morning. 
28938,leo,White House Chief of Staff. 
28939,leo,"General Chairman, Bartlet for America. "
28940,leo,"We met for the first time about 32 years ago, but I would say our friendship began 11  years ago. "
28941,leo,No. The First Lady's known him the longest. 
28942,leo,Yes. 
28943,leo,"Four years ago, last month, at the statehouse in Concord. "
28944,bartlet, Huh? 
28945,bartlet,"Thomas Hilton started a fishing village here in 1623, Allen. "
28946,bartlet,Yeah. 
28947,bartlet,And a slogan's going to do that? 
28948,bartlet,Yeah? 
28949,bartlet,"Oh, oh, slow down, you're going too fast. "
28950,bartlet,$367 million in snowmobiling? 
28951,bartlet, And the goggles... That includes the goggles? 
28952,bartlet,"Okay. Thanks, guys.  Mrs. Landingham! Thanks. "
28953,bartlet,Speaking of crusty New England relics...
28954,bartlet,Nah. Abbey wants to eat at Patsy's tonight. Would you let them know we're coming? 
28955,bartlet,What's next? 
28956,bartlet,Leo's here? 
28957,bartlet, Leo! 
28958,bartlet,"Yeah, yeah. Hey. "
28959,leo,"Hey, Governor.  ""New Hampshire. It's what's new""? "
28960,bartlet,Jenny and Mallory are okay? 
28961,leo,Yeah. 
28962,bartlet,What are you doing here? 
28963,leo,I don't know. What do you got? You got leaves. I came to look at the leaves. 
28964,bartlet,What are you doing...? 
28965,leo,I came to talk to you. 
28966,bartlet,Everything's okay? 
28967,leo,Yeah. 
28968,bartlet,Why didn't you call? 
28969,leo,'Cause you would've asked me what I wanted to talk to you about. 
28970,bartlet,Where are you staying? 
28971,leo,At the Marriott. 
28972,bartlet,What do you want to talk to me about? 
28973,leo,I've been thinking about getting back into politics. 
28974,bartlet,"I think that's great, man. I think it's about time. You probably mean the House, but I  think you should consider the Senate seat in Illinois in two years; I can help raise money. "
28975,leo,"No, I wasn't thinking about the Senate. I was thinking about the White House. "
28976,bartlet,"Hey, Leo, I swear to God there's no one I'd rather see in the Oval Office than you but  if you run there's going to be a lot of discussion about Valium and Alcohol. I mean,  it's going to come out; this is the world. "
28977,leo,"Yeah. See, I wasn't thinking about me. "
28978,bartlet,Who? 
28979,leo,"I've been walking around in a kind of daze for two weeks and everywhere I go...planes,  trains, restaurants, meetings...I find myself scribbling something down. "
28980,bartlet,"What? Leo takes a napkin out of his pocket, licks it, and sticks it on the posterboard  easel. It reads ""Bartlet for America."" "
28981,leo,No. 
28982,leo,No. 
28983,leo,No. 
28984,leo,I don't know. 
28985,leo," Listen, I'm going to talk a little and you nod and  talk a little bit back to me. "
28986,leo,That's good. 
28987,leo,I think Rathburn's being a little snotty I think he's going to have to wait and I think  he's going to have to wait with the camera on me. 
28988,leo,"One second, please.  Listen, what are you doing for lunch? "
28989,leo,Because I thought maybe we could have lunch or something. 
28990,leo," Congressman, could you repeat the question, please? "
28991,leo,"Yeah, I don't know. "
28995,josh, Let's go. 
28996,josh,"17-month investigation, 34 black churches. How can there be no evidence of a conspiracy? "
28997,josh,Mike- 
28998,josh,Yeah.
28999,josh,You met with Leo this morning? 
29000,josh,"All right, well, let's listen in on this meeting for a minute. "
29001,josh,Yeah. Let's go. 
29002,josh,Charlie. 
29003,josh,Let's go. 
29004,bartlet,"Well, the phone calls have been coming all morning, Governor. You should know that Algiss  Skyler called. "
29005,bartlet,Skyler wants to know why the hell you haven't. 
29006,bartlet,Was Eisenhower wrong in '57? Kennedy in '61? 
29007,bartlet,"We don't know what the situation is, do we, Josh? "
29008,josh,"No, sir. Mr. President, this is Special Agent Mike Casper who's acting as the FBI's White  House liaison during this situation. "
29009,bartlet,"Do we know what's going on, Agent Casper? "
29010,bartlet,"Edward, so far the churches have been empty. There have been no fatalities. But tomorrow  night's Christmas Eve. They're going to be packed. So why shouldn't I send troops in? "
29011,bartlet,This doesn't happen in New Hampshire. 
29012,bartlet,"We'll meet again this afternoon. Thank you, Governor. "
29013,bartlet,"Josh, stick around. "
29014,josh,"Yes, sir. "
29015,bartlet,"So, what have you got cooking? "
29016,josh,I'm sorry? 
29017,bartlet,"I said, what have you got cooking? "
29018,josh,I don't understand. 
29019,bartlet,"Yes, you do. I know what happened at the third debate. He told me. I know what's going to  happen this afternoon. What are you going to do? Are you going to try and get Gibson out  of the room when it's his turn to question? "
29020,josh,"I don't think you and I should discuss it, sir. "
29021,bartlet,Where are we? 
29022,bartlet,"Abbey's about to get spanked. Guys, the things we do to women. My wife's a world-class  scientist. "
29023,leo,Edith Wilson was Edith Galt before she became the second wife of Woodrow Wilson. 
29024,leo,Yes. 
29025,leo,Yes. 
29026,leo,"Well, I don't know who she kept it to, Congressman. "
29027,leo,No. 
29028,leo,"Yes, sir. "
29029,leo,Because at this point there wasn't much of a high command. All we'd done is show a strong  third in Iowa. We were working out of storefront. 
29030,toby,You got to pop the ball. You got to pop it. 
29031,c.j.,I'm popping it. 
29032,toby,"No, you're not. "
29033,sam,So my feeling- 
29034,toby,Yeah? 
29035,sam,Is that we're fine playing this song in South Carolina. 
29036,c.j.,I agree. 
29037,toby,Pop it. 
29038,sam,As long as all he's doing is running against Wiley it's fine that he doesn't seem like a  real candidate. 
29039,toby,It's when Wiley drops out and he's running against Hoynes. 
29040,sam,"Right. They'll cover us all the way to South Dakota. Suddenly, we don't want to be quaint  anymore. People want to know ""Is this guy for real?"" "
29041,sam,We got to show them we're an honest-to-God alternative. We got to show them we're big time. 
29042,c.j.,Can we get an intern over here? 
29043,sam,"What about this. A series of major, national policy addresses. We work with Josh; we pick  three issues. "
29044,toby,"Yeah, and we should start projecting the image that he thinks he's for real. "
29045,c.j.,"We'll release his tax returns, put all his stocks in a blind trust. "
29046,sam,You know what else? 
29047,toby,Yeah. 
29048,sam,He should take a physical. 
29049,c.j.,Absolutely. He's got ten years on Hoynes. We should release a medical report. 
29050,toby,I'll take it to Leo. 
29051,sam,"Okay, guys, let's go. Let's be working. Somebody want to get the ball?"
29053,bartlet,Yeah.
29055,bartlet,Which one's he?
29057,bartlet,They're all young.
29059,bartlet,"Listen, they want me to do some things before South Dakota."
29061,bartlet,"Yeah, we're lookin' past that."
29063,bartlet,Full financial disclosure...
29065,bartlet,They want me to take a physical. 
29066,bartlet,What's a physical right now gonna show?
29068,bartlet," I'm not lying to anybody, Abbey. I'm taking a physical - a physical which  I'm under no legal obligation to take. I'm doing it voluntarily."
29070,bartlet,"Now is when people are listening. I'll make my speeches, get whooped on Super Tuesday,  and we'll all go home."
29071,bartlet, The things we do to women.
29072,josh,Listen...
29073,sam,They're coming back from the break.
29074,josh, Yeah.
29075,sam,You know what I was thinking about? I was thinking about when we threw that basketball  through the window of the first campaign headquarters in Manchester.
29076,josh, I wasn't there. I heard about it.
29077,sam,You weren't throwing the ball around with us?
29078,josh,"It was you, Toby, and C.J."
29079,sam, What that must've looked like from the point of view of  someone walking down the sidewalk...
29080,josh,I need somebody in the steel lobby to speak to Darren Gibson right away - sometime toward  the end of this hour.
29081,sam, Jim Jericho.
29082,josh,Jim Jericho's who I had. He had to leave town. His wife is sick. Who else do we have?  One of our people?
29083,sam,Nick Grindell. 
29084,sam,"Well, I'll get to somebody. What's this about?"
29085,sam,It's not about nothin'. You want Gibson out of the room.
29086,sam,Josh.  What's Gibson got?
29087,josh, You'll get a guy for me?
29088,sam, Yeah.
29089,leo,We're gonna have to do this again.
29090,leo,Yeah.
29091,leo,So... I was thinking maybe... you know... dinner...
29092,leo," Well, what do I have to pay to only tell you some things?"
29093,leo,So what are you saying about dinner?
29094,leo,"Yes, I am."
29095,leo,"No, it says the Vice President assumes his duties if the President dies. Short of that,  impeachment, or the 25th Amendment being invoked, the Vice President stays the Vice President."
29096,leo,The President did.
29097,leo,Yes.
29098,leo,I don't see how. No.
29099,leo,Hold it.
29100,leo, You owe an apology  to fathers of children who are suffering from this disease.
29101,leo,"Finally, the President chose his running mate using the only yardstick that means anything:  ability to assume the duties of the Presidency. And with John Hoynes, we got our man.  And the Vice President was immediately told of the President's condition."
29102,bartlet,Toby?
29103,toby, Yeah.
29104,bartlet,Josh?
29105,josh,Yeah.
29106,bartlet,Sam?
29107,sam, Yeah. I think so.
29108,c.j.,Yeah.
29109,bartlet," All right, let's do it."
29110,leo,All right.
29111,leo,John?
29113,bartlet, Senator. 
29114,bartlet,I'd like you to be the Vice-President.
29115,bartlet,"Why don't you sit with Abbey and me for a few minutes.  Can I have the  room, please?"
29116,bartlet, You want anything? Coffee or anything?
29117,bartlet,You ran a good campaign.  You're a young man. You'll be back.
29118,bartlet,"There's something you need to know. It's why I asked everyone to leave the room.   A few years ago, I was diagnosed with a relapsing remitting course of MS."
29119,bartlet,Multiple sclerosis. 
29120,bartlet,Yeah.
29121,bartlet,I told you because it's something you're gonna need to know. But also because I wanted to show  that I trust you.
29122,bartlet, Yeah.
29123,bartlet," Well, what do you say?"
29124,bartlet," I'd like your answer now, John."
29125,bartlet,I'm gonna stretch my legs.
29126,josh,"If you could please give him that message as soon as he gets in or, you know, when he returns  the page. Cindy, if I could tell you what it's regarding I'd have told you. Sorry. Thank you. "
29128,josh,Where have you been? 
29130,josh,Has Sam called? 
29132,josh,He didn't maybe drop off a piece of paper with a name on it? 
29134,josh,Okay. 
29135,josh,Where have you been? 
29136,josh,President's going to make a decision right now. We got to... What? 
29137,josh,What do you mean? 
29138,josh,Why? 
29139,josh,Why? 
29140,josh,Did he name friends? 
29141,josh,We got ourselves a conspiracy. 
29142,josh,Let's go. 
29143,josh,To brief the President.
29144,josh,"Mike, that's your task force out there. The only reason you're not out there with them is  'cause-- I don't know-- 'cause you're a woman or something. "
29145,josh,Let's go. 
29146,josh,You'll take a handshake. Let's go.
29147,josh,Mr. President? 
29148,bartlet,Yeah? 
29149,josh,Your decision just got a lot easier. 
29150,bartlet,Tell me. 
29151,bartlet,Conspirators?
29152,bartlet,"All right. Here come the Tennessee Volunteers. Reverend, have the pastors encourage the  women to bake those guys something nice. They're all spending Christmas Eve where they  don't want to be. Ed, you get to be a hero to the blacks in your state. Anybody in your  state doesn't like it the FBI is calling the shots. What could you do? Anything else? "
29153,bartlet,I'm sorry. I've forgotten your name. 
29154,bartlet,How'd you get him? 
29155,bartlet,A two-year investigation gets its first crack from a broken taillight.
29156,bartlet,"God, well, some of the stupidest criminals in the world are working right here in America.  I've always been very proud of that. "
29157,bartlet,"Thank you, Agent Casper. "
29158,bartlet,"So, what's going on? "
29159,josh,"I got to call him and tell him, you know- "
29160,bartlet,It's not going to happen? 
29161,josh,I don't think so. 
29162,bartlet,"It was a long shot, anyway. Look, I wanted to see him spared this but Leo's made out of  leather. His face has a map of the world on it. Leo comes back. "
29163,josh,Okay. 
29164,bartlet,All right.
29165,bartlet,Damn it.
29166,leo,No. 
29167,leo,No. 
29168,leo,No. 
29169,leo,No. 
29170,leo,I'm not sure what the medical term would be. 
29171,leo,Yes. 
29172,leo,So far as I know. 
29173,leo," No, it's not. "
29174,josh,Leo... I couldn't make it happen.
29175,leo,Don't worry about it.
29176,leo, Look-
29177,leo,"On the day of the final debate, I was meeting with two potential donors..."
29178,leo,Anybody wanna eat? I got steak sandwiches on the way.
29179,leo, Sure.
29180,leo,"The President was at the debate site, walking the stage.  A podium  is a holy place for him..."
29181,leo, ...I love him so much...
29182,leo, ...I like the little things...
29183,leo,"  The way a glass feels in your hand - a good glass, thick, with a heavy base. I love the sound an  ice cube makes when you drop it from just the right height. "
29184,leo, Johnny Walker Blue...is 60-year-old scotch.
29185,leo,I'm trying to tell you what happened.
29186,leo,Should we get to it?
29187,leo, Naw... I gotta... stay sharp for tonight.
29188,leo,They're two CEOs. I'm tryin' to get 'em to give me half-a-million dollars a piece right now.  It's not really the best time to mention it.  The President's still at the debate site.
29189,bartlet,It's good.
29190,bartlet," It won't be later. This is a 550 seat theater and they'll be seated a  half-hour before we start, so the temperature'll be up four to six degrees."
29191,leo,You wanna hedge your bet.
29192,leo, Good... Now gimme a sip of that.
29193,leo,That's what I remember.
29194,leo,I'm an alcoholic. I don't have one drink.  My brain works differently.
29195,leo,"Well, now we've arrived at our problem."
29196,leo, Count on it.
29197,leo,I don't get drunk in front of people. I get drunk alone.
29198,sam, Where's Leo?
29199,josh, I'd still like to go over the Social Security answer. We gotta get it  down to 90 seconds.
29200,c.j.,It's down to 90 seconds.
29201,josh,It's not - and they're gonna cut him off.
29202,sam,I put a stopwatch on him. When he just speeds up...
29203,josh,"When he speeds up, he speeds up. When he doesn't... It's 90 seconds. We need to cut some more."
29204,toby, Which words?
29205,josh,"Governor, what do you think? Governor?"
29206,josh,"Sir, we were just saying on the Social Security answer..."
29207,bartlet, No.
29208,josh,"...it's a tight ninety seconds, and..."
29209,bartlet," No, no. Not now."
29210,josh," Well, we gotta do it now, sir."
29211,toby,Something's wrong.
29212,c.j.,Governor?
29213,bartlet, Yeah.
29214,josh,Governor?  Sir?
29215,bartlet,G'abbey...
29216,sam,You wanna sit down?
29217,c.j.,Let me get some water. 
29218,bartlet,G'abbey...
29219,toby,"He's saying, ""Get Abbey."""
29220,josh, Get Abbey!
29221,josh,Whoa...
29222,toby, C.J.
29223,leo, Yeah.
29224,josh," Leo, the Governor's sick."
29225,leo,Okay.
29226,josh, He collapsed. You gotta get down here.
29227,josh, Leo.
29228,leo,Okay.
29229,leo, Okay!
29230,leo,Okay... Okay... 
29231,leo,Hey. 
29232,leo, I uh... I-I gotta get to the uh debate site. The Governor  collapsed.
29233,leo,"That's because you think it has something to do with smart and stupid. Do you have any idea  how many alcoholics are in Mensa? You think it's a lack of willpower? That's like thinking  somebody with anorexia nervosa has an overdeveloped sense of vanity. My father was an  alcoholic.  His father was an alcoholic. So, in my case..."
29234,leo,That's right.
29235,leo,Josh Lyman and the President.
29236,leo,Because.
29237,leo," I went to rehab. My friends embraced me when I got out. You relapse, it's not  like that. ""Get away from me"" - that's what it's like."
29238,leo,I like you. I've been tryin' to get it in under the wire.
29239,leo,Okay.
29240,leo,Yes? What?
29241,leo, Okay.
29242,sam,I tried everybody.
29243,josh, It's all right.
29244,sam,I tried everybody. It was just a tough fit. And since I couldn't tell 'em what it was about...
29245,josh, They're back.
29246,leo,What?
29247,leo,I'm sorry...?
29248,leo,What the hell...?
29249,leo,I really had to tell you the damn story?
29250,leo," Well, listen."
29251,leo,You wanna do it tomorrow night instead?
29252,leo,It's Christmas Eve.
29253,leo, Okay.
29254,bartlet,"Well, well, well."
29255,bartlet,Dodged a bullet.
29256,leo,For the moment.
29257,bartlet, Which is more than I can say for me in Rosslyn.
29258,leo, Yeah.
29259,bartlet,Did you get a date with her?
29260,leo,It's none of your business...  See how badly you screwed up this church thing in Tennessee.
29261,bartlet,I did the church thing in Tennessee okay. I did it without you.
29262,leo,You mind if I make some calls - see if Tennessee's still one of the states and stuff?
29263,bartlet,"So anyway, I have a present for you."
29264,bartlet,"Merry Christmas, Leo."
29265,bartlet,That was awfully nice of you.
29266,leo,Good evening.
29267,leo,I'm not that easily intimidated.
29268,leo,I don't care if the police are out there. Can somebody speak?
29269,leo,"You mean, what you're about to say or the five minutes we just did on the Capitol Police?"
29270,leo,Okay.
29271,leo,Yeah.
29272,leo,Yes.
29273,leo,Yes.
29274,leo,He didn't lie.
29275,leo,"Look, I'm not..."
29276,leo,"You keep saying the White House, but you mean the President."
29277,leo,Why aren't you talking to the President?
29278,leo,Yeah?
29279,leo,"Okay. Well... I'll just call the President and suggest to him that he allow a huge  bipartisan vote on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives calling him a liar,  and that he welcome the result. Then, I'm gonna flap my wings and fly to Neverland."
29280,leo,"You think I am so desperate to roll my ass, I'm gonna roll over on Jed Bartlet?"
29281,leo,  Is that all you got?
29282,leo,Good night.
29283,sam,"All right, I've got copies. "
29284,josh,Have you read it? 
29285,sam,Bits and pieces. 
29286,josh,How is it? 
29287,sam,I'm going to set up a war room downstairs. 
29288,josh,It's serious? 
29289,sam,Yeah. 
29290,josh,I'm up! 
29291,sam,"All right... this is ""The Camera Doesn't Lie: What I Saw at the Bartlett White House""  by Ron Burkhalt. "
29292,c.j.,Have you read it? 
29293,sam,Bits and pieces. 
29294,c.j.,How is it? 
29295,sam,I'm setting up a war room downstairs. 
29296,c.j.,It's serious? 
29297,sam,How many times do you think we're going to have to do this? 
29298,c.j.,I'm up. 
29299,sam,"We're each taking a couple of chapters.This is just based on what, Ginger? "
29300,sam,"So, presumably the chapters you've been assigned are about you. If not, trade with  somebody. What we're doing is making note of anything big or small that's wrong.  Anything I can use to attack credibility."
29301,sam,What? 
29302,c.j.,I usually don't know that. 
29303,josh,Sam? 
29304,sam,Yeah. 
29305,josh,Are we taking this a little too seriously? 
29306,sam,No. 
29307,josh,He was a White House photographer. He was fired. My recollection is that he was a buffoon. 
29308,sam,"He was a buffoon, which has always stopped the American public, to say nothing of the  press, from taking something seriously. "
29309,josh,So what are you saying? 
29310,sam,"The book's in stores in three weeks. In a week, the press will have excerpts. That's  how much time I have to turn this guy into a punch line."
29311,c.j.,"It was miniature golf, wasn't it? "
29312,toby,"Yeah. Sam, got anything else? "
29313,sam,No. Thank you.
29314,josh,Toby? 
29315,toby,Yeah. 
29316,josh,"Listen. You know Amy Gardner, right? "
29317,toby,Women's Leadership Coalition. 
29318,josh,Yeah. 
29319,toby,Yeah. 
29320,josh,"I've know her for a while, actually. She went out with my roommate in college. "
29321,toby,Huh. 
29322,josh,I saw her a couple of weeks ago about some language in the Vienna Treaty. 
29323,toby,I remember. 
29324,josh,Mrs.Bartlet sent me there. 
29325,toby,Yeah. 
29326,josh,"I don't know, she changed her hair or something. Something's going on. "
29327,toby,What do you need?
29328,josh,"Well, I'm a straight shooter. I think my record's pretty clear on that. "
29329,toby,Yeah. 
29330,josh,I'd like to see her again. 
29331,toby,Call her. 
29332,josh,And ask her out? 
29333,toby,Yeah. 
29334,josh,"No, no. 'Cause there's a potential she says no and then I have to move someplace where  it'll never be spoken of again. "
29335,toby,Yeah. 
29336,josh,I need to come in under the cover of business. 
29337,toby,'Cause you're a straight shooter. 
29338,josh,"Yeah. I need a point of friction. An issue where the feministas and the White House  disagree. That way, I can go to, her break the bad news, stand tough, smooth it over  and then, you know, I take it from there. "
29339,toby,"How about the word ""feministas""? "
29340,josh,"Nah. Come on, you've been doing outreach to the women's groups on the State of the  Union-- where are we? "
29341,toby,They're happy. 
29342,josh,Very happy? 
29343,toby,Yeah. 
29344,josh,With the surplus projections changing? 
29345,toby,Women are getting a decent break. 
29346,josh,Damn-- where the hell are the pro-lifers when you need them? 
29347,toby,"Sons of bitches, don't they know you're trying to get... "
29348,josh,"Hey, this is not that. She's got... I really... I'm... bewitched. I'm ensorcelled.  There's got to be some way we're screwing them over. "
29349,toby,There's an anti-family planning amendment on Raleigh's foreign ops supplemental... 
29350,josh,We killed it in Committee. 
29351,toby,Pay Equity Act? 
29352,josh,They're the ones who want to wait. 
29353,toby,Breast cancer screenings through Medicare? 
29354,josh,Fully funded. Head Start's okay. What about paid family leave? 
29355,toby,They know it's a dream they don't want us to waste the capital. 
29356,josh,We can't just compromise like that. 
29357,toby,"They want us to compromise, like that. "
29358,josh,They should be outraged. 
29359,toby,"They're not, they just want a study funded. "
29360,josh,How much we putting towards the study? 
29361,toby,Almost everything they asked for. 
29362,josh,Almost? 
29363,toby,"They wanted $21 million, they're getting $20.5. "
29364,josh,"Well, that's practically an insult. "
29365,toby,Yeah. 
29366,josh,"Okay. Paid family leave, there it is. "
29367,toby,"Yeah, I'd go with paid family leave. "
29368,josh,Paid family leave. There it is. Okay. 
29369,toby,Hey. 
29370,josh,Yeah.
29371,toby,"Listen. Come here. You're inside, right? "
29372,josh,On what? Leo? 
29373,toby,"You were nervous when he took the stand before the break. So was the President. Then  they called the recess. I don't know what was going on - that's okay, that's the way  somebody wants it. But you're inside, right? "
29374,josh,Yeah. 
29375,toby,Good. If it's something Communications is going to have to work with... 
29376,josh,The lawyers are talking about it. 
29377,toby,When I have to know I will. 
29378,josh,Yeah. 
29379,toby,Okay. Paid family leave.
29380,bartlet,Charlie. 
29381,bartlet,How was your weekend? 
29382,bartlet,What'd you do? 
29383,bartlet,Time well spent. 
29384,bartlet,Weren't you going to a flea market? 
29385,bartlet,You didn't have to do that. 
29386,bartlet,Nice sucking up. 
29387,bartlet,"Look at these topographical details. Seriously, I'm going to have this framed, this is great. "
29388,bartlet,"No, I'm going to play with it some more. "
29389,leo,Good morning. 
29390,bartlet,"Look at this map. 1709. The Dead Sea, Jordan River, Mount Sinai. "
29391,leo,That's beautiful. 
29392,bartlet,You want to come inside? 
29393,leo,Yeah. 
29394,bartlet,"Thanks again, Charlie. "
29395,bartlet,How'd it go? 
29396,leo,Last night? 
29397,bartlet,Yeah. 
29398,leo,It was nothing. 
29399,bartlet,What did they offer? 
29400,leo,Nothing. 
29401,bartlet,They didn't offer nothing. 
29402,leo,"It was a non-starter, don't worry about it. "
29403,bartlet,Censure? 
29404,leo,"Yeah. Anyway, I'm going to go to a budget meeting where the OMB and treasury are going  to recommend we drop the child poverty fund from the State of the Union. "
29405,bartlet,"Well, I get it but see what you can do about it, okay? "
29406,leo,"Yeah, anything else? "
29407,bartlet,"No, I've got a security briefing downstairs. "
29408,leo,"Thank you, Mr. President."
29409,leo,Margaret! 
29410,leo,Yes. 
29411,leo,Is it just an open house in here? 
29412,leo,Yeah. 
29413,leo,"Well, if you're going to make a strong exit, you really can't wait for someone to get  their purse together. "
29414,leo,A question I've been asking my entire adult life. 
29415,leo,"No, could you tell me, 'cause I've really started to take an interest in government lately. "
29416,leo,Jordan... 
29417,leo,I have a meeting. 
29418,leo,I have a meeting. 
29419,leo,"I'm sorry, I have a budget meeting. "
29420,leo,Jordan... 
29421,leo,"This isn't that! This is 535 Congressmen and Senators standing up and saying the  President lied and should be ashamed of himself. And this is us standing up and saying  you're right. This would be the first time in history a President has been censured.  Congress isn't talk radio. It's the seat of democracy, their opinion matters and their  condemnation doesn't have to come with handcuffs to be devastating to this President.  That is the force and effect and it's not going to happen because of me. I have a  budget meeting, Jordan."
29422,sam,Hey. 
29423,toby,Hey. 
29424,sam,Listen. 
29425,toby,eah. 
29426,sam,How's it going with the thing? 
29427,toby,My chapters? 
29428,sam,Yeah. 
29429,toby,I'm done. 
29430,sam,And? 
29431,toby,I'm fine with it. 
29432,sam,What do you mean? 
29433,toby,I'm fine with it. 
29434,sam,You're saying it's all true? 
29435,toby,No. Hardly any of it's true. 
29436,sam,Then it's not true. 
29437,toby,"Well, my name is Toby Ziegler and I'm the Communications Director though there's a typo  in ""communications"" at one point. Perhaps... "
29438,sam,Perhaps... 
29439,toby,"Perhaps I mumble from time to time but prickly? I do not think so. Nonetheless, I'm fine  with it. "
29440,sam,"Toby, no kidding, I need a fact/fiction paper. "
29441,toby,I'd really rather not have one over my signature. 
29442,sam,There's a ticking clock. It has to get discredited before it's real. 
29443,toby,I remember this guy as a not very talented not very pleasant malcontent who wasn't here  very long. Am I remembering the right guy? 
29444,sam,Yeah. 
29445,toby,"Yeah, well, I don't want him to know I remember him at all. "
29446,sam,That's nice. Now if we can only get 200 million other people to think that way. 
29447,toby,"Yeah, I... "
29448,sam,"Conventional wisdom in Washington is like concrete-- it hardens. There's nothing you can  do about it. So, let's... "
29449,toby,Is there anything in particular? 
29450,sam,In your chapters? 
29451,toby,Yeah. 
29452,sam,It says you and I were sent out of the Oval Office to write an introduction for a Teacher  of the Year ceremony while others stayed for a serious discussion on Latin America.  We weren't sent out of the room. We left voluntarily to work on a major education address  instead of waiting another ten minutes while White House operators kept trying to connect  the President with the President of Equador who was only calling to complain one more  time about how we resolved the banana crisis. We weren't sent out of the room. Will you  put that down in a memo? 
29453,toby,Yeah.
29454,toby,"Okay. On Carol's birthday, did you happen to attend a seance where they tried to contact  Margaret's grandmother? No, right? "
29455,toby,Thanks. 
29456,bartlet,Hey. 
29457,bartlet,"Good afternoon, Mr. President. "
29458,bartlet,There seems to be a growing consensus that no one's going to believe I'm serious about  paying down a trillion dollars of the debt when I'm willing to spend $200 billion on  the child poverty fund. 
29459,toby,I agree with the growing consensus. 
29460,bartlet,I'm not saying we're not going to do it. We're just going to find a different way of  saying we're going to do it. 
29461,toby,We're on it. 
29462,bartlet,Anything else? 
29463,bartlet,Thank you. What's going on? 
29464,toby,"Well, I guess you should know we have galleys of a book that's coming out in a few weeks.  A kiss-and-tell by a photographer who worked for me for about a half hour. "
29465,bartlet,Fiction or nonfiction? 
29466,toby,"Science fiction, really. "
29467,bartlet,What else? 
29468,toby,Everything else is the State of the Union. 
29469,bartlet,"All right. Hey, you want to see something? Charlie gave this to me. It's a map of the  Holy Land, drawn in 1709. He got at a flea market. It's hand-colored, copper engraved.  I was going to put it in the outer office. "
29470,toby,This outer office? 
29471,bartlet,Yeah. 
29472,toby,No. 
29473,bartlet,Why? 
29474,toby,Why? 
29475,bartlet,Yeah. 
29476,toby,'Cause some people are going to find it offensive. 
29477,bartlet,Why? 
29478,toby,It doesn't recognize Israel. 
29479,bartlet,It was drawn in 1709. 
29480,toby,Yeah. 
29481,bartlet,There was no Israel. 
29482,toby,Right. 
29483,bartlet,Israel wouldn't happen for another 250 years. 
29484,toby,Yeah. 
29485,bartlet,"So, what's the problem with the map? "
29486,toby,Some people are going to find it offensive. 
29487,bartlet,Why? 
29488,toby,It doesn't recognize Israel. 
29489,bartlet,"Take lunch, would you? "
29490,toby,"Hey, your favorite movie was on TV last night. "
29491,bartlet,"""By God, I'm 50, alive, and the King all at the same time."" "
29492,toby,"I turned it on just as they got to the scene when Richard, Geoffrey and John were  locked in the dungeon and Henry was coming down to execute them. Richard tells his  brothers not to cower but to take it like men. And Geoffrey says, ""You fool! ""As if  it matters how a man falls down."" And Richard says... "
29493,bartlet,"...it matters a great deal."" "
29494,toby,It matters a great deal. 
29495,bartlet,Are you trying to tell me something? 
29496,toby,"No, Mr. President, of course not. "
29497,bartlet,Okay. 
29498,toby,"Thank you, sir."
29500,josh,I'll take it. I'll take it. That's for me. 
29502,josh," Press hold, and I will pick up the phone in my office. "
29505,josh,Amy. 
29506,josh,How you doing? 
29507,josh,Good. 
29508,josh,Are you wrestling with someone right now? You in the middle of a match or something? 
29509,josh,You spend a lot of time at the gym. 
29510,josh, Compared to me. 
29511,josh,"Listen, uh, we need to talk about something. "
29512,josh,"Paid family leave. Sorry, there was a dog in here for a second. "
29513,josh,A nice one. It was... uhkay. 
29514,josh,"Well, I-I'd like to talk about this in person. Any chance we could get together? "
29515,josh,Can you have a late dinner tonight? 
29516,josh,As late as you like. 
29517,josh,"Well, I don't want to bust up your date or anything. "
29518,josh,"Uh, 11:00. "
29519,leo,Anything? 
29520,leo,Thank you. 
29521,leo,Okay. 
29522,leo,Margaret? 
29523,leo,Close the door. 
29524,leo,Look... 
29525,leo,Jordan... No. The opinion of Congress matters? Yes. And they're rattling it off every  day on television. 
29526,leo,It's not the opinion.. 
29527,leo,My reputation isn't... 
29528,leo,"This is not your thing. It is my thing and I'm sorry, but I can't allow you to talk  like that in here. "
29529,leo,You need to get... You need to get that I am the White House Chief of Staff. 
29530,leo,It's not my decision. 
29536,josh,Yeah? 
29538,josh,See ya. 
29540,josh,What's the problem? 
29542,josh,Has it started snowing yet? 
29544,josh,See you. 
29546,josh,No. 
29554,bartlet,Yeah? 
29555,bartlet,Thanks. 
29556,c.j.,"Good evening, Mr. President. "
29557,bartlet,"Hey, C.J. "
29558,c.j.,You're working late. 
29559,bartlet,"You, too. What's up? "
29560,c.j.,"Well, this might sound ridiculous. "
29561,bartlet,Let's lay odds. 
29562,c.j.,You know we're trying to vett this book. 
29563,bartlet,I've heard about the book. 
29564,c.j.,So... 
29565,bartlet,Yes? 
29566,c.j.,"""It is well known in the Bartlet White House that after having two daughters Jed  Bartlet wanted a son and sought advice from the book 'How to Choose the Sex of Your  Baby' by Dr. Landrum B. Shettles. The book recommends that the father-to-be avoid  jockey shorts, jock straps and other tight-fitting clothes."" "
29567,bartlet,Yeah? 
29568,c.j.,"So, I can put you down for a ""no?"" "
29569,bartlet,"When you're going to be a father you're rooting for ten fingers and ten toes, and  that's it. "
29570,c.j.,"Thank you, Mr. President. "
29571,bartlet,Wait. I want to show you this great map Charlie found. 
29572,c.j.,"Sir, I know about it. You can't put it up in the West Wing. "
29573,c.j.,It doesn't recognize Israel. 
29574,bartlet,There was no Israel in 1709. 
29575,c.j.,That's right. 
29576,bartlet,"So, it's not on the map. "
29577,c.j.,Which is what some people are going to find offensive. 
29578,bartlet,That's ridiculous. 
29579,c.j.,You know what would be great? 
29580,bartlet,If I put it someplace else? 
29581,c.j.,Yes. 
29582,bartlet,"Leo has--in what used to be his house when he was married--a map of the United States.  The first third of it is the 13 original colonies. The second third of it is the French  territory of Louisiana. And the third third is Mexico. In this map of the United States,  there is not a single state. That's because when this map was made there was no United  States. "
29583,bartlet,I am the President of the United States and I'm not offended by it. 
29584,c.j.,"Well, you're bigger than ten men, sir. What do you say we put it out of the way? "
29585,bartlet,"I'm having it enlarged and bolting it to the hood of my limo. They don't want us to  put up our map, Charlie. They're philistines in the fight for freedom but that doesn't  bother us, does it? "
29586,bartlet,Never mind. 
29587,c.j.,"It's not like I'm agreeing with the people who are going to be offended. It's just  that you're asking for a whole lot of pain, in exchange for which you get nothing  but an old map. "
29588,bartlet,That's the key. An old map. An old map. Spin that. 
29589,c.j.,"See, now you got me out there spinning things. "
29590,bartlet,Anything else? 
29591,c.j.,"You didn't have special underwear, right? "
29592,bartlet,Thank you. 
29593,c.j.,"Thank you, Mr. President."
29606,josh, Hello. 
29607,josh,How was the ballet? 
29608,josh,Which one was it? 
29609,josh,I know The Nutcracker although I've never been. 
29610,josh,"But I should start with The Nutcracker, right? "
29611,josh,No. 
29612,josh,"Well, I've never been to Bosnia either, Amy, and I don't think I'm going to go. "
29613,josh,Not a bit.
29614,josh,"Uh, Absolut martini on the rocks. Two olives, please. "
29615,josh,I'm sorry? 
29616,josh,Paid family leave. 
29617,josh,It's not going to happen. 
29618,josh,At least not this year. 
29619,josh,"I mean, we can't even go for it. "
29620,josh,We can't. 
29621,josh,Who was the date? 
29622,josh,At the ballet? 
29623,josh,And he likes the ballet? 
29624,josh,I think he likes the ballet. 
29625,josh,Thank you. Thank you for the extra olive. 
29626,josh,Won't catch her at the ballet. 
29627,josh,She seemed smart to me. 
29628,josh,How can you be blase about this? 
29629,josh,The United States is one of only six other countries out of 152 that has no national  policy regarding paid maternal leave. 
29630,josh,Really? 
29631,josh,Can't do it. 
29632,josh,But money has been put aside for a study. 
29633,josh,The thing is...and here's the bad news. 
29634,josh,You guys wanted $21 million? 
29635,josh,"It's going to be $20 million 500,000. You want to take my head off, go ahead. "
29636,josh,Things are tight all over. 
29637,josh,"I mean, i-is it possible? I suppose you can say... "
29638,josh,"Hey, you threw a water balloon at me. "
29639,josh,"I don't know, I was just throwing that out there. "
29640,josh,Like there's not a reason you're here right now? 
29641,josh,"All I know is you're here, I'm here and Nijinsky's home watching Leno. "
29642,josh,Your boyfriend? 
29643,josh,Do you need me in this conversation or are you okay by yourself? 
29644,josh,That's not true. 
29645,josh,"Okay, that's like the fifth time you've said ""guys like you."" "
29646,josh,It's the second time. 
29647,josh,What's with guys like me? 
29648,josh,"That's not true.  Excuse me. Hello. Donna, I'm kind of in the middle of  something. What were you doing talking to...? Okay, tell him yeah. I have to go. "
29649,josh,I'm sorry. I-I can't explain.  I have to go.
29650,bartlet,Sure. 
29651,sam,"Good evening, sir. "
29652,bartlet,Everybody's working late. 
29653,sam,I live here in January. 
29654,bartlet,How's it going? 
29655,sam,"It's going well, I think. But I don't know. Who knows at this point? "
29656,bartlet,The early drafts look good. 
29657,sam,"Thank you, but, actually, I didn't come in to talk about the State of the Union.  There's going to be a book coming out in about three weeks. "
29658,bartlet,"I heard. Look, I'm really not going to talk to you about my underwear. "
29659,sam,"That's... disappointing, Mr. President. But I wanted to ask you... the guy claims  that while you don't poll on matters of foreign policy that at the first formal  meeting of the Joint Chiefs you upbraided them for bloated Pentagon spending and  told them 73% of the public was with you on it. I don't remember any such poll being  done, do you? "
29660,bartlet,"No, but I guess that doesn't mean it wasn't. "
29661,sam,Do you remember saying that at the first meeting with the Joint Chiefs? 
29662,bartlet,I don't. 
29663,sam,Could you have said anything like it? 
29664,bartlet,I don't even remember the meeting. 
29665,sam,"Okay. Thank you, sir. "
29666,bartlet,Why does it matter? 
29667,sam,Excuse me? 
29668,bartlet,"I said, ""Why does it matter?"" "
29669,sam,"Well, 'cause I don't think it's such a good idea to be casual about the truth. "
29670,bartlet,Neither do I. 
29671,sam,"Thank you, sir."
29672,josh,Leo? 
29673,leo,Yeah. 
29674,josh,What are you doing down here? 
29675,leo,Change of scenery. What are you doing? 
29676,josh,"Well, I'd like to talk to you about the deal they're offering. "
29677,leo,"Please, keep your voice down. "
29678,josh,"There's nobody here, and my voice is down. "
29679,leo,Who have you been talking to? 
29680,josh,Cliff Calley. 
29681,leo,How did you get hooked up with Calley? 
29682,josh,Doesn't matter. 
29683,leo,It does matter. 
29684,josh,"I'm not pushing you, okay? I just want to hear your reasons. "
29685,leo,What are your reasons? 
29686,josh,"Gets it over and done instead of dragging it through the primary season. Moreover,  you don't take the stand on Monday. "
29687,leo,It's ridiculous to think that this would end it. All it means is that we go down in  history. 
29688,josh,It's a press release. 
29689,leo,"When the British Ambassador told the German Foreign Minister that they were going to  war over Belgium's violation of the neutrality treaty the German Foreign Minister  said ""You're going to war over a piece of paper?"" "
29690,josh,Leo... 
29691,leo,It is an historical judgment. Andrew Jackson knew that. 
29692,josh,Jackson was censured? 
29693,leo,Over the Bank of the U.S. 
29694,josh,Guess what. I didn't know that. 
29695,leo,What's your point? 
29696,josh,History forgets these things. 
29697,leo,"Presidents don't. They never get over it. This one won't. He'd act like it's fine,  but...he'd never get over it. So... that's my reason. "
29698,josh,All right. 
29699,leo,You're going home? 
29700,josh,Yeah. Sure. 
29701,leo,Have a good night. 
29702,josh,"You, too."
29703,toby,"McDeere shot 1 for 23 from the field last night. Missed his first 18 attempts. Wouldn't  you think after the first 17 misses the coach would say, ""Mickey, this isn't your night""? "
29704,c.j.,You don't have work to do? 
29705,toby,I have a lot of work to do. 
29706,c.j.,And? 
29707,toby,Can't rush these things. 
29708,c.j.,No. 
29709,toby,1 for 23. That's exactly one better than my mother would have done. She's been dead  12 years. 
29710,sam, Excuse me. 
29711,c.j.,Hi. 
29712,sam,I asked the President about that first meeting. 
29713,toby,Which meeting? 
29714,sam,With the Joint Chiefs. 
29715,toby,What'd he say? 
29716,sam,He didn't remember whether or not we did a poll. 
29717,toby,"Yeah, I don't either. "
29718,sam,Toby... 
29719,toby,How long ago was it? 
29720,sam,"It was... I don't know. It was, like... I don't know. It was two years ago. "
29721,toby,How many polls ago? 
29722,sam,We can't sit on... I'm sorry. We can't sit on the sidelines and ignore this crap.  I'm not going to. Why am I the only one taking this seriously? 
29723,toby,That's a reasonable question and we should explore that for a minute. 
29724,sam,It's not the reason you think. 
29725,toby,You hired the guy. 
29726,sam,"Yes, I hired the guy, but that's not... Legitimate news organizations are going to cover  this to say nothing of the people who hate us who are going to run it over, over, over,  over, over...This guy was here for three minutes and he was fired. He is not credible.  I'm a lawyer, I'm telling you. That has to be made clear. Every time he makes a factual  mistake we got to come out with a press release. Every time he misquotes or misidentifies  anyone we need to have an affidavit swearing to the truth. If there's a comma in the  wrong place he needs to be killed until he is dead and he needs to be killed again or  he is going to keep biting at our ankles and I mean all through the campaign. He needs  to be a joke, or we're going to be. "
29727,c.j.," Boy, boy, crazy boy. Keep cool, boy... "
29728,sam,I'm not screwing around. 
29729,c.j.,Me neither. Sit down. 
29730,sam,I'm not going to be a victim of this. 
29731,c.j.,"Let me tell you something I've learned in my years. There are victims of fires. There  are victims of car accidents. This kind of thing, there are no victims--just volunteers.  Of course we'll get in the game. I'll talk to the editors of the major papers but we're  not going to publicly refute every bogus charge. First of all, there are too many of them.  Second of all, I'm not going to give this guy and his book the weight of the White House.  As far as the press is concerned I've read the book because I had to. You have a vague  recollection of the guy but he wasn't here long enough to make a lasting impression.  Have you read the book? Of course not. You're too busy doing a job. "
29732,sam,While you're convincing the Post and the Times that it's ridiculous... 
29733,c.j.,"Sam! Once again, we don't know what's going on in the Oval Office. Obviously, there's  a problem. When it's our turn to worry about it they won't be shy about telling us.  Let's not fixate on the nuckleheaded stuff we think we can fix in the meantime. And  it feels a lot like...that's what you're doing. "
29734,sam,Are you inside? 
29735,toby,Josh is. But let me ask you this. A guy shoots 1 for 23 from the field. 
29736,sam,McDeere? 
29737,toby,"Yeah. But he goes 8 for 8 from the foul line. My question is, why are you fouling this  guy at all? I'd just get out of the way and point him toward the basket. "
29738,sam,Yeah. 
29739,c.j.,So we're done talking about this now. 
29740,sam,Is there any beer? 
29741,c.j.,You two have offices. 
29742,toby,It's out in the refrigerator. 
29743,sam,Hey. 
29744,c.j.,What? 
29745,sam,It started snowing.
29746,josh,I paid for the drinks. 
29747,josh,What are you doing here? 
29748,josh,I do. I'm sorry I had to leave quickly before. I still can't tell you why. 
29749,josh,No. 
29750,josh,No. 
29751,josh,You were having quite a bit of sex with Chris. 
29752,josh,"I studied a lot in school. I studied hard in high school and at Harvard and in law  school. My IQ doesn't break the bank, and I wanted to do this so I studied all the  time. And I missed something or it's like I skipped a year 'cause I never learned  what you do after you think you like somebody-- what you do next. And every-everybody  did learn. A lot of other people, anyway. I didn't walk out tonight. When my phone  rings at 11:00, it's important. Not important to me. Important. And I'm not puffing  myself so-so that you're... "
29753,bartlet,Excuse me. 
29754,leo,"Good evening, Mr. President. "
29755,bartlet,You want to step in for a second? 
29756,leo,Are you up reading? 
29757,bartlet,"Yeah. No. A little bit. Mostly, I've been talking with Babish and some of the deputies.  The Chairman, Trent, the Speaker, the Minority Leader. "
29758,leo,No. 
29759,bartlet,"Yeah, I'm going to do it. "
29760,leo,Sir... 
29761,bartlet,Yeah. 
29762,leo,It doesn't get Abbey off the hook. She's still going to have to deal with the AMA. 
29763,bartlet,Yeah. 
29764,leo,"It doesn't clear us up for the campaign. It's just a different looking stage weight  around our ankle and now it comes with the Congressional Seal. It doesn't give us any  room to argue the point. We've got two, maybe as many as three dozen House Democrats  in tight races, and you've still got MS. Doing this to save me the embarrassment I've  got coming to me is about the dumbest reason I can think... "
29765,bartlet,There's another reason. 
29766,leo,What? 
29767,bartlet,"I was wrong. I was. I was just...I was wrong. Come on, you know that. Lots of times we  don't know what right or wrong is but lots of times we do and come on, this is one.  I may not have had sinister intent at the outset but there were plenty of opportunities  for me to make it right. No one in government takes responsibility for anything anymore.  We foster, we obfuscate, we rationalize. ""Everybody does it."" That's what we say. So we  come to occupy a moral safe house where everyone's to blame so no one's guilty. I'm to  blame. I was wrong. "
29768,leo,You're ready for a Joint Resolution. 
29769,bartlet,"As a matter of fact, it's not a Joint Resolution. The President still has to sign a  Joint Resolution so, technically, it's a Concurrent Resolution. House Concurrent  Resolution 172. The lawyers will haggle over the wording in the next few days. So,  at least I'll make history, huh? "
29770,leo,"No. I thought so, too, until I was talking to Josh. Andrew Jackson, 1834. "
29771,bartlet,He was censured in '34. He got it expunged in '36. 
29772,leo,Good point. It's not that cold out. 
29773,bartlet,No. Let me ask you something. You may be the last sane voice around here. 
29774,leo,"Hang on, before I forget. That map that Charlie gave you. Make sure you don't put it  where people can see it. "
29775,bartlet,I don't believe this. 
29776,leo,"Recognizing Israel's a pretty hot button, wouldn't you say? "
29777,bartlet,"In Lebanon. Not here. It's not like I'm thinking ""God, I was going to recognize Israel,  but now that I've seen this map..."" You know what? Let's just sit here quietly. "
29778,leo,"Yes, sir. "
29779,sam,The dials go from zero to 100. They dial up if they like what he's saying. They dial down  if they don't. All the numbers lead to a central computer.
29780,sam,Yeah.
29781,sam,Huh?
29782,sam,"They're in Macomb County. They're in Portland. In Los Feliz, California. Norman, Oklahoma.  Joey puts together a decent snapshot."
29783,sam,Kenny! Can we get Joey a second?
29784,sam,I just said thanks.
29785,sam,Could he go easy with the pictures?
29786,sam,When did I say that?
29787,sam,"Joey, this is Lisa Sherborne. She's doing a piece for Vanity Fair."
29788,sam,"""Death is bad."""
29789,sam,We don't really talk about that.
29790,sam, Hang on.
29791,sam," Hey, crank that up."
29792,sam,We nearly had one almost as big.
29793,sam,I said we nearly had one almost as big.
29794,sam,We almost cured cancer.
29795,sam,This close.
29796,sam,Just one of those things.
29797,josh,"Hey, Amy."
29798,josh,Yes.
29799,josh,You said not to talk to you.
29800,josh,"Yes, I am."
29801,josh,Look...
29802,josh,Amy...
29803,josh,"Ice and vodka, please."
29804,sam,"Thank you. Thank you. I am at Ha Ha's in Cleveland on the 16th, and tip your waitresses."
29805,josh,Sam. Congratulations.
29806,sam,"Hey, you too."
29807,josh,"So far so good, huh?"
29808,sam,The dials were what we thought. We'll wait for the overnights.
29809,josh,Lisa.
29810,josh,Still trying to get waived into Generation X?
29811,josh,"Oh, you betcha. See you later."
29812,sam,It got cut.  Jack Daniels.
29813,sam,We were gonna say we were gonna cure cancer. Curing it is someone else's department.
29814,sam,How does what work?
29815,sam,You mean writing the State of the Union?
29816,sam,It's a long story.
29817,sam,Do you do any kind of preparation before you come to report...
29818,sam,Hang out at Moomba?
29819,sam,The process begins six weeks beforehand with budget meetings.
29820,sam,"'Cause if we're introducing a new idea, people are gonna want to know how we pay for it."
29821,sam,Hmm?
29822,sam,"It's hard under the best circumstances. Obviously, it got a little harder two weeks ago."
29823,sam,Yes.
29824,leo,Good morning.
29825,josh,What's going on?
29826,leo,"Late last night, early this morning, the President reached an agreement with the  Leadership to accept a Congressional Censure."
29827,c.j.,How's he feeling?
29828,leo,Hmm?
29829,c.j.,How's he feeling?
29830,leo,Fine. It's over.
29831,sam,Joint Resolution?
29832,leo,"Yeah. A Concurrent Resolution, actually. It'll take a couple of days for the lawyers to  get together on the language."
29833,c.j.,"We should leak in the meantime, soften up the ground?"
29834,leo,Yeah.
29835,c.j.,He's all right?
29836,leo,"He's about to be censured, and then he's gonna deliver the State of the Union, and then  he's gonna run for reelection. My guess is that there are some things on his mind.   It's over. That's all."
29837,c.j.,Thank you.
29838,sam,Thank you.
29839,sam,This is like the Civil War. When's the last time Congress rebuked a sitting president?
29840,toby,The Civil War.
29841,sam,"And now, how do you...?"
29842,toby,Yeah.
29843,c.j.,Should we postpone the State of the Union? What are the rules on that?
29844,toby,"He's required to give Congress information on the State of the Union. If he buys Congress  a subscription to the Wall Street Journal, he's fulfilled his Constitutional..."
29845,sam,Postponing or canceling's an admission of defeat.
29846,c.j.,He's accepting a censure. That is defeat. And you don't ask the school bully out to lunch  the day after he stole your lunch money.
29847,sam,"You don't go on a starvation diet, either. And we can spin the censure as a bipartisan..."
29848,c.j.,You can't spin a formal denunciation from the legislative branch. It spins itself.
29849,sam,I don't...
29850,c.j.,"It's our biggest press hit of the year, our biggest pre-convention campaign exposure. I  don't know how you make a formal report to Congress when Congress just called you a liar."
29851,josh,I say we strap a polygraph onto the TelePrompTer.
29852,josh,All right.
29853,c.j.,Hey Sam.
29854,sam,Yes?
29855,c.j.,Well argued.
29856,sam,Yeah.
29857,sam,What do you want?
29858,c.j.,What kind of attitude is that?
29859,c.j.,Vanity Fair's pitching my office a story on you.
29860,sam,What's the angle?
29861,c.j.,"They want to do a profile, and they want to start the reporting on the night of the State  of the Union."
29862,sam,Why don't they just cover the State of the Union address?
29863,c.j.,This is their way of doing that. The thing is... you know the writer.
29864,sam,Who?
29865,c.j.,Lisa Sherborne.
29866,sam,That's funny 'cause I used to be engaged to someone named Lisa Sherborne.
29867,c.j.,Isn't it funny?
29868,sam,I'm not doing it.
29869,c.j.,I'd like you to.
29870,sam,What happened to rule number one on staff profiles being that we don't do staff profiles?
29871,c.j.,When did we have that rule?
29872,sam,We should have that rule. Keep the focus on the President. People should think he writes  the State of the Union.
29873,c.j.,I think people know about speechwriters.
29874,sam,Then there's no more story to tell.
29875,c.j.,"In the past, you tell me. Did it help or hurt that the campaign had a youthful and  energetic energy?"
29876,sam,"I'm not sure you can say ""energetic energy."""
29877,c.j.,Did it help or hurt?
29878,sam,It helped.
29879,c.j.,Do we need help right now? Do young women read Vanity Fair?
29880,sam,So let them cover the President.
29881,c.j.,"They do cover the President. Right now they want you, and I want to give you to them."
29882,sam, It's got to be Lisa Sherborne?
29883,c.j.,"Hey, is the reason you guys didn't get married is 'cause her name would have been Lisa  Sherborne Seaborn?"
29884,sam,Yeah. That's the reason.
29885,c.j.,I could do this for a living. 
29886,sam,Do you have anything?
29887,sam,I don't believe you.
29888,sam,"If you didn't have anything, you wouldn't be out here at the party."
29889,sam,What do you have?
29890,sam,Okay.
29891,sam,Why?
29892,sam," I just need a minute, okay?"
29893,sam,I need you to wait over there.
29894,sam,Why don't I want the first 20 minutes?
29895,sam,Tell me.
29896,sam,Just tell me.
29897,sam,Independents?
29898,sam,You're kidding me.
29899,sam,Low 40s?
29900,sam,Ten minutes. You said ten minutes and not this bad.
29901,sam,We did Internet commerce in the first 20 minutes. We did child asthma...
29902,sam,"Top line, cross-tabs, whatever you get, I got a bad feeling about tonight."
29903,sam,No.
29904,sam,"It was polling numbers, but it was... it was nothing."
29905,sam,It's too early to tell.
29906,sam,"You too. Ed, Larry, this is Lisa Sherborne from Vanity Fair."
29907,sam,Thank you.
29908,sam,I like to let them know they're talking to a reporter.
29909,sam,I don't know what that means.
29910,sam,A lot of things got cut.
29911,sam,"Hey, we had to cut a section about making government manuals easier to read, so curing  cancer can take a number."
29912,sam,I'm not pissed at you. I'm working.
29913,sam,I'm not done working. You're confused because you see Absolut Cosmopolitans and famous  people.
29914,josh,Donna?
29916,josh,Can you get me the most recent memo from the DPC on the welfare-to-work initiatives?
29918,josh,I'm seeing Amy again tonight.
29920,josh,"First date really. Last night was more of a, you know..."
29922,josh,Yeah.
29924,josh,That is so false.
29926,josh,A late drink.
29928,josh,Wilson's.
29930,josh,I don't.
29932,josh,"Well, for one thing, the piano player only seems to know one song."
29934,josh,"""Little things with fur better hurry..."""
29936,josh,Okay.
29938,josh,Whatever. It's like I'm on a hayride.
29939,josh,What are you doing?
29941,josh,It was official travel.
29943,josh,What does the rule say?
29945,josh,What's the problem?
29947,josh, Just put it on my credit card.
29949,josh,"And damn it, that's my job."
29951,josh,We are the system.
29953,josh,Yes. I need the welfare-to-work memo.
29955,toby,266.
29957,toby,173.
29959,toby,No.
29961,toby,What's going on?
29962,josh,Welfare-to-work.
29963,toby,I was happy when you said this morning that you recommended the censure.
29964,josh,Your face didn't register much.
29965,toby,I was thinking about the speech.
29966,josh,I figured.
29967,toby,Don't ask me how it's going.
29968,josh,I wouldn't.
29969,toby,It's in the larva stage. You can't rush these things. It's not like putting a hammer  to a nail.  I need some pie.
29970,josh,You should go get some. 
29971,toby, Come with me.
29972,josh,Okay.
29973,toby,Don't ask me about the speech.
29974,josh,Wouldn't do it.
29975,toby,How'd it end up going last night?
29976,josh,With Amy Gardner?
29977,toby,Yeah.
29978,josh,"Very, very well."
29980,josh,Thank you.
29981,toby,You know Amy's seeing somebody.
29982,josh,I do know that.
29983,toby,You know who?
29984,josh,"No, and I don't want to know. Yes, now that you mention it, who?"
29985,toby,John Tandy.
29986,josh,Really?
29987,toby,Yeah.
29988,josh, Really.
29989,toby,Yes.
29990,josh,Interesting.
29991,toby,Yeah.
29992,josh,"It's interesting, and I'll tell you why."
29993,toby,Why?
29994,josh,Because John Tandy is a...
29995,toby,"I'll tell you why, seriously."
29996,josh,Why?
29997,toby,'Cause they started seeing each other shortly after Nan Lieberman announced he was gonna  make a primary challenge in the 20th district.
29998,josh,Really?
29999,toby,Yeah.
30000,josh,Ah-so.
30001,toby,I don't think he's courting Amy Gardner. I think he's courting women.
30002,josh,I don't think you're right.
30003,toby,Why?
30004,josh,'Cause that's ridiculous.
30005,toby,Really?
30006,josh,"No. It's not ridiculous. Of course, you're right."
30007,toby," Hey, who's the President having dinner with tonight?"
30008,josh,Friends of Abbey.
30009,toby,"Good, 'cause when you're in this kind of mood, having dinner with your wife's friends  is just what you're hoping for."
30010,bartlet,I'm sorry?
30011,bartlet,Abbey just went to take a phone call.
30012,bartlet, What did you just say? 
30013,bartlet,Right. The part I understand was Bobby saying we could cure cancer in ten years.
30014,bartlet,"In other words, make it so that people could live with it?"
30015,bartlet,What is standing between us and that happening?
30016,bartlet,Who at this table knows?
30017,bartlet,How much money would it cost?
30018,bartlet,He just said...
30019,bartlet,He just said ten years. I want to hear about this from the beginning. Talk to me like  I'm not an oncologist.
30020,toby,I'm out of pie.
30021,sam,We'll get some more.
30022,toby,So how's it going on the uh... what are you doing?
30023,sam,The economy. I'm getting somewhere.
30024,toby,I can look at it when you're ready.
30025,sam,How about another two hours?
30026,toby,Lisa's gonna do a piece?
30027,sam,It wasn't my idea.
30028,toby,I wouldn't think so.
30029,sam,C.J. asked me if the reason we didn't get married was because her name would've been  Lisa Sherborne Seaborn.
30030,toby,That's funny.
30031,sam,Yeah.
30032,toby, So why didn't you get married?
30033,sam,Hmm?
30034,toby,Why didn't you?
30035,sam,She didn't like me very much. 
30036,toby,Ah.
30037,toby,"Good evening, Mr. President."
30038,sam,"Good evening, sir."
30039,bartlet,"I want to call everybody in. I just had dinner with some of Abbey's friends. They're  all oncologists. I think in the State of the Union, I can announce that I'm directing  our researchers to have a cure for cancer in ten years. Call everybody in."
30040,toby,This is about the censure.
30041,josh,I said it for your own good.
30042,josh,I did. I like you.
30043,josh,Let's look at the facts.
30044,josh,He was polling at 69% among Democrats. And that's all Tandy's got in his district.
30045,josh,"All right. He had a 69% favorability rating with women. You need 93% favorability among  men to beat that, and Mahatma Gandhi doesn't get that in the Florida 20th."
30046,josh,"When Nan Lieberman announces that she might challenge him in the primary, his favorability  goes down to 52%. You know why?"
30047,josh,'Cause women started going over to Lieberman.
30048,josh,Women's groups started hedging saying there aren't enough women in Congress. Tandy needs  women. NOW hasn't endorsed him yet.
30049,josh,"Yes. Still, when did he start going out with you? A week after Lieberman announced."
30050,josh,I know everything. And you are the door to women. The WLC put nine million dollars in the  hands of pro-choice candidates. You narrowed the gap in the House from 14 to nine in one  election. You bring home the bacon.
30051,josh,I do.
30052,josh,I don't think I'm getting enough credit for saying this for your own good.
30053,josh,Look...
30054,josh,We're changing the sub...
30055,josh,Perhaps...
30056,josh,I should just sit here?
30057,josh,And?
30058,josh,Amy...
30059,josh,You don't have to...
30060,josh,Hello?
30061,toby,Josh?
30062,josh,Yeah.
30063,toby,You got to come back.
30064,josh,Why?
30065,toby,The President thinks he can cure cancer.
30066,josh,"Well, that's some good news, I guess."
30067,toby,Yeah. I'll see you in a few minutes.
30068,josh,"Hey, did I hear Toby right on the phone?"
30069,josh,How?
30070,josh,Do the two of you ever go anywhere separately?
30071,josh,A little weird. Yeah.
30072,josh,What's going on? What was that phone call?
30073,toby,We're gonna meet and talk.  How'd it go?
30074,josh,Not at all well. You know whose fault that is?
30075,toby,John Tandy's?
30076,josh,No.
30077,toby,Hers?
30078,josh,Yours.
30079,leo,Let's go.
30080,toby,"Leo, is he serious...?"
30081,leo,He's on his way down.
30082,josh,Totally your fault.
30083,toby,"I'm just, you know... I'm just the guy who does the thing."
30084,josh,What?
30085,toby,We've run out of pie.
30086,bartlet,Good evening. Thanks for being here so late.
30087,bartlet,"A President stood up. He said we will land a man on the moon before the end of the  decade. You know what we knew when he said that? Nothing. We didn't know anything.  We didn't know about the lunar surface. We didn't know how to land one of these things.  All we'd ever done is crash it into the ocean. And God knows we could figure out how to  land soft. We didn't know how to blast off again, but a President said we're gonna do it,  and we did it. So I ask you, why shouldn't I stand up and say we are going to cure  cancer in ten years?"
30088,josh,"Well, how close are we to really being able to do this?"
30089,bartlet,Nobody knows.
30090,josh,Then...
30091,bartlet,Toby.
30092,toby,It'll be seen as a political ploy.
30093,bartlet,Why?
30094,c.j.,It can be seen...  It can be seen as self-serving.
30095,bartlet,How?
30096,c.j.,Using cancer to deflect attention from MS.
30097,bartlet,You think people with cancer care what my motives are? You think their families do?
30098,c.j.,I'm saying...
30099,bartlet,Joey?
30100,bartlet,"Once again, why would somebody...?"
30101,bartlet,I didn't...
30102,bartlet,Sam.
30103,sam,Yes sir?
30104,bartlet,Why shouldn't I do it?
30105,sam,I think you should. I think ambition is good. I think overreaching is good. I think  giving people a vision of government that's more than Social Security checks and debt  reduction is good. I think government should be optimistic.
30106,bartlet,"I'm sorry. I know it's late, but I want to start seeing drafts of a new section in the  next few hours. C.J., I want a sense of a media overview, too."
30107,bartlet,Now.
30108,bartlet,I just want to look at some drafts.
30109,toby,I don't have an hour and a half to spend on this.
30110,sam,I can do it.
30111,toby,You don't have an hour and a half to spend on it either.
30112,sam,Why are you opposed to this?
30113,toby,Stopping what we're doing to write about curing cancer?
30114,sam,Yeah.
30115,toby,'Cause it's never gonna be in the speech.
30116,sam,How do you know?
30117,sam,I don't know.
30118,sam,I don't know.
30119,toby, That's how I know.
30120,sam,I'm not humoring him.
30121,toby,I don't want you spending more than an hour and half. 
30122,sam,You're a pollster.
30123,sam,You don't think this will poll well?
30124,sam,So?
30125,sam,Why?
30126,sam,When did you get an M.D.?
30127,sam,Who's he?
30128,sam,There is no speech yet.
30129,sam,I have to work now. The President asked me to try this.
30130,josh,Listen... When the hell are we getting numbers?
30131,josh,I hear that a lot. When are we getting numbers?
30133,josh,What in God's name could you possibly want right now?
30135,josh,Yeah?
30137,josh, Excuse me.
30138,josh,I have no idea what you just said.
30139,josh,Feminine?
30140,josh,Forgive us for talking to lawyers about the law.
30141,josh,The Minority Whip doesn't work for us.
30142,josh,Amy...
30143,josh,I'm not quarreling with his credentials as a lover of women. I happen to know he excels  in that area.
30144,josh,I'm just saying...
30145,josh,I was saying that. I was saying it two weeks ago. Now I'm not saying anything in the  vicinity of that.
30146,josh,Congressman.
30147,josh,We'll see. 
30148,josh,Go ahead. Photo-op.
30149,josh, Hmm. We'll see.
30150,bartlet,Yeah. Come on in.
30151,sam,"Good evening, Mr. President."
30152,bartlet,You got it?
30153,sam,Yeah.
30154,bartlet,This is good.
30155,sam,You know we can't do it.
30156,bartlet,Yeah.
30157,sam,"We need to line up experts who can face the press, and in just two weeks."
30158,bartlet,Yeah.
30159,sam,"Sloane-Kettering, Dana-Farber, The Cleveland Clinic, UCLA."
30160,bartlet,We'd want to include the Society of Clinical Oncology.
30161,sam,And the NCI.
30162,bartlet,The OMB would have to score it. We haven't identified the offsets to pay for it. We can  barely tell them what the it is.
30163,sam,"Clinical trials under Medicare and Medicaid, Science and Technology Democrats, the  pharmaceutical companies."
30164,bartlet, It was a good idea though.
30165,sam,We have other good ideas.
30166,bartlet,So we don't get water from a rock. We just do our thing and take our chances.
30167,sam,I think so.
30168,bartlet, We're gonna have to do it awfully well this time.
30169,sam,We've done that before.
30170,bartlet,Anything else?
30171,sam," Thank you, Mr. President."
30172,c.j., Would you excuse me?
30173,toby,What?
30174,toby,Give us the real one.
30175,josh, We're back! Yes! Yes!
30176,bartlet,Somebody get these guys some pie.
30177,c.j.,"Joey, is there an extra copy of the panel backs? I didn't get one."
30178,c.j.,Thanks.
30179,c.j.,Hang on.
30180,toby,Dance with me!
30181,c.j.,Hang on! I'm just gonna toss this in my office.
30182,c.j.,Nice job. Take the rest of the night off.
30183,c.j.,"Well, you earned it."
30184,c.j.,"Sam, Sam, sunshine man. Get on the couch, I'm gonna do you right now."
30185,sam,Okay.
30186,c.j.,"Sorry, I was still talking to Carol."
30187,sam,What is wrong with you?
30188,c.j.,"We really don't know.  Lisa mentioned that it wasn't going that well tonight.  You still got a couple of weeks with her, you'll..."
30189,sam,Yeah. I wish that we hadn't started tonight.
30190,c.j.,Why? It was a shining moment.
30191,sam,"It got the job done, but it's ironic, 'cause that thing, sort of, a thing between us is  I'm supposed to know the difference between flash and substance."
30192,c.j.,Sometimes a little flash is what's required. You said that to me.
30193,sam,I say that when I don't have anything to say.
30194,c.j.,It wasn't a Vegas act. It was stirring. And I wouldn't hang your head when you say it  got the job done. That job was impossible and it had to be done. There aren't ten guys  in the country who could write that speech.
30195,sam,I bet the Cancer Committee can't wait to buy me a beer.
30196,sam,"Hey, I'm just, you know. Anyway, congratulations. And if you're serious about that thing  with Carol, I can just sit in the corner and not even say..."
30197,c.j., Get out.
30198,sam,Sorry. I was just getting some polling numbers.
30199,sam,"They're internal numbers. CNN/USA Today will have something in a little while. Anyway,  this is my office over here."
30200,sam,"They're internal numbers, Lisa, I can't..."
30201,sam, This is my office.
30202,sam, C.J. asked me a couple of weeks ago if the reason we didn't get married is  because your name would be Sherborne Seaborn.
30203,sam, Why didn't we get married?
30204,sam,"'Cause I don't know what the cool restaurant is, and I don't care. When I get hungry,  I want to eat. And I don't know where the Tommy Hilfiger party is, and I don't know  what to do once I get there."
30205,sam,I was never cool enough for you.
30206,sam,Often it's not clear to me whether or not I have.
30207,sam,How would you know?
30208,sam," Here's something interesting. In 1940, our armed forces weren't among the 12  most formidable in the world, but obviously we were gonna fight a big war. And Roosevelt  said the U.S. would produce 50,000 planes in the next four years. Everyone taught it was  a joke, and it was. 'Cause it turned out we produced 100,000 planes. Gave the air force  an armada that would block the sun."
30209,sam,About curing cancer?
30210,sam," ""Over the past half-century, we've split the atom, we've spliced the gene,  and we've roamed Tranquility Base. We've reached for the stars, and never have we  been closer to having them in our grasp. New science, new technology is making the  difference between life and death, and so we need a national commitment equal to this  unparalleled moment of possibility. And so, I announce to you tonight, that I will  bring the full resources of the federal government and the full reach of my office  to this fundamental goal: we will cure cancer by the end of this decade."""
30211,josh,Why would I put it back?
30212,josh,Hello.
30213,josh,I thought you were breakfast.
30214,josh,What?
30215,josh,What?
30216,josh,I just went to sleep about two hours ago.
30217,josh,Is the sun even up?
30218,josh,"No, not so much."
30219,josh,What makes you say that?
30220,josh,I know it’s too big for me. What are you doing here?
30221,josh,You’re flaky. You know that? You’re quite the flake.
30222,josh,I was done with this fight a month ago.
30223,josh,It’s early.
30224,josh,"No, I’m saying it’s 5:00 in the morning."
30225,josh,He always takes photo-ops with you.
30226,josh,"We’re gonna stop with the apples soon, right?"
30227,josh, I admit it.
30228,josh,"No, of course, I’m right. And his relationship with you has everything to do with  politics. He’s a power dater. That’s what power daters do. You know how I know?"
30229,josh,That’s right.
30230,josh,"‘Cause you looked in his eyes, saw his soul, and confronted him in a moment of human  honesty?"
30231,josh,Then he was sure to tell you the truth.
30232,josh,Why?
30233,josh,No.  He asked you to marry him?
30234,josh,And you want me to talk you out of it?
30235,josh,Good.
30236,josh,Really?
30237,josh,Okay.
30238,josh,"No, I’m not."
30239,josh,We spent six nights with each other.
30240,josh,I’m counting them all.
30241,josh,He just upped and proposed?
30242,josh,"No, Ophelia. It’s called a political asset."
30243,josh,It doesn’t.
30244,josh,I’ll say more when you call me 30 seconds from your cell phone.
30245,josh,You’ll call me from your cell phone ‘cause that’s where the real conversation always  takes place.
30246,josh,It’s laundry day.
30247,josh,Time number one was on the steps in front of my apartment when you kissed me. It was  snowing. Time number two was when you came over after the State of the Union. Time  number three was at your house when you put on your bootleg tape of the Stones at Wembley  Stadium and put on your feather boa...
30248,leo,"Josh, I’m gonna stop you right here, okay?"
30249,josh,Leo?
30250,leo,Yeah.
30251,josh,Anybody else in the office?
30252,josh,"Hey, Margaret."
30253,leo,"We’ve got a problem in Vieques and a caucus in Iowa. Why don’t you come on into work, hmm?"
30254,josh,Yeah. 
30255,c.j.,"I’m on the plane... No, I’m on the plane... I’ll be coming back tonight. It’s just for  the day... No, it’s just for the day, Dad. We’re coming back tonight... I won’t be  tired... I’ll sleep if I’m tired, but I won’t be tired... ‘Cause we’re coming back at  8:00 and I don’t get tired at 8:00, plus I won’t be the one flying the plane... Oh, my  God. Dad, ‘cause this is how it is. If it’s in the 48 states, we come back the same day.  The taxpayers paid for a very comfortable and fast airplane, and this is what they had in  mind when they did... Am I gonna... No... Because I don’t live in Iowa, and I’m not  allowed to vote there... Ah, see. There’s always a catch... Well, he’s unchallenged in  the Iowa caucus, so I like our chances... No, Dad. I’m on the plane... All right. I’ll  try and call you later if there’s anything interesting to report... Talk to you later."
30256,toby,Anything else?  Okay. Thanks everybody.
30257,c.j.,Excuse me.
30258,toby,Is it possible we’re riding into town in a soy-diesel bus?
30259,c.j.,"There was talk of it, but that idea got kicked off pretty quick."
30260,toby,"Yeah, okay."
30261,c.j.,I’m gonna go back there. Have you guys zeroed in on a message for the day?
30262,toby,How to reform the freedom to form act?
30263,c.j., Ritchie’s pulled in to single digits in the overnights.
30264,toby,I saw.
30265,c.j.,What a gift from heaven it would be if he won.
30266,toby,Hmm? Yeah.
30267,c.j.,"So, the Four-H Convention?"
30268,toby,We’re not going.
30269,c.j.,I don’t get it. How can you not want to see the butter cow?
30270,toby,I’m that way.
30271,c.j.,"There’s also a butter Elvis and a butter Last Supper, which has, I swear to God, Toby..."
30272,toby,Butter on the table?
30273,c.j.,It’s got butter on the table right there between butter James and butter Peter. An almost  mind-blowing vortex of art and material that dares the viewers to recall Marcel Duchamp.
30274,toby,How do they keep it from melting?
30275,c.j.,How indeed.
30276,toby,Thank you.
30277,c.j.,"Butter, butter, butter, butter, butter, butter, butter."
30278,toby,Thank you.
30279,c.j.,Duchamp is the father of Dadaism.
30280,toby,I know.
30281,c.j.,The dada of Dada.
30282,toby,"It’s like there’s nothing you can do about that joke. It’s coming, and you just have to  stand there."
30283,c.j.,"The cow made of butter? That’s how I like my irony served, my friend."
30284,toby,I have a phone call waiting that’s being relayed through four satellites.
30285,c.j.,Okay.  Okay.
30286,toby, Yeah.
30287,sam,"Hey, I’m gonna guess where you are right now, okay?"
30288,toby,Okay.
30289,sam,"Wheels-up was 5:35 heading west-northwest.  You’re not at your  cruising altitude yet, so I’m gonna say an average of 400 knots with a light headwind,  but I’m gonna go ahead and guess Cumberland, West Virginia. Am I right?"
30290,toby,I have no idea.
30291,sam,"Well, then we’ll say I’m right. Listen, do you remember Bob Engler?"
30292,toby,No.
30293,sam,I met with him a few years ago from the U.S. Space Command.
30294,toby,He told you they were tracking UFO in the skies over Maui?
30295,sam,Yeah. Do you have any idea why I have another appointment with him today?
30296,toby,I don’t.
30297,sam,Okay.
30298,toby,"Listen, Ritchie’s made a statement last night in support of the Pennsylvania Referendum  banning any use of race in college admission. I think the President should say something  in the U.I. Campus."
30299,sam,About affirmative action?
30300,toby,Yeah.
30301,sam,He shouldn’t.
30302,toby,Why?
30303,sam,Because Ritchie’s not gonna be the Republican nominee for President.
30304,toby,Write up a few sentences would you? Send it up to the plane right away.
30305,sam,Yeah.
30306,toby,Okay. 
30307,josh,Hi.
30309,josh,I’m a little tired today.
30311,josh,Yeah.
30313,josh,I’m supposed to see Leo.
30315,josh,Why?
30317,josh,When?
30319,josh,"Well, why don’t you wait till we’re a little closer and ask me again?"
30321,josh,No.
30323,josh,What kind of legal authority do you think I’m empowered with?
30325,josh," You get... Yes, thank you."
30327,josh,And?
30329,josh,Then it looks like justice is finally in your hands.
30331,josh,"Yes, well, there’s nothing I can do for you."
30333,josh,She... I don’t...
30334,leo,Hey.
30335,josh,What’s going on in Vieques? Protesters?
30336,leo,Yeah. Listen. Something like five ships out of the U.S.S. Thurman Battle Carrier steamed  in yesterday. What they need is final combat certifications before they can be deployed  to the Indian Ocean where they’re needed right now.
30337,josh,Yeah.
30338,leo,"You understand they need to do ship-to-shore gunnery and air-to-ground bombing exercises  before they’re certified, and they can’t go until they’re certified."
30339,josh,Okay.
30340,leo, All right. So some 40 protesters have planted themselves in a live target range.
30341,josh,I don’t-I’m sorry. Why am I...? This is national security.
30342,leo,"One of the protesters, in fact, the leader, apparently, is a friend of yours."
30343,josh,Billy.
30344,leo,Yeah.
30345,josh, Arrest them. It’s what he’s waiting for you to do.
30346,leo,This is a well-known actor. This well-loved young man in the Hispanic community. He’s  with other well-loved men in the Hispanic community.
30347,josh,Wait them out.
30348,leo,"They’ve got supplies, and we don’t have the time. He’s got a cell phone, and we’ve got  the number."
30349,josh, No.
30350,leo,Yeah.
30351,josh,"Leo, if I wasn’t working here, I’d probably be with them down there."
30352,leo,"Yeah, but you’re working here."
30353,josh,This is a crappy thing to do with friendship. These things aren’t supposed to be personal.
30354,leo,We’re at DefCon 4. I’m sorry. We’re arranging the call.
30355,bartlet,"You can check a whip count, but I don’t think we get 60 votes in a cloture motion."
30356,bartlet,I think we lose eight Democrats once they find there is a foreign aid budget.   Anything else?
30357,bartlet,What’s up?
30358,toby,"Uh, well, Ritchie made a statement last night in support of the Referendum in  Pennsylvania. Sam’s gonna work on a few lines in response."
30359,bartlet,"Look, he’s gonna make statements during the primary that force me to move to my left.  It’s not like I get a swing at every pitch, right?"
30360,toby,You know everyone still thinks it’s gonna be Simon.
30361,bartlet,You and I know different.
30362,toby,The overnights have Ritchie inside single digits.
30363,bartlet,"Every candidate’s dream opponent, huh?"
30364,toby,Yeah.
30365,bartlet,I’ll take a look at what Sam does.
30366,toby, We should respond.
30367,bartlet,I’ll take a look at it.
30368,toby,"Thank you, Mr. President."
30369,josh,Come in.
30370,sam,What’s going on?
30371,josh,I’m waiting for a phone call.
30372,sam,I mean in Vieques.
30373,josh,"Billy Molina and some people were in a Coast Guard line. They’ve camped out in the live  target range. There’s a carrier that has to fire in the live target range or they can’t  be certified. If they’re not certified, they can’t be deployed, and they have to be  deployed."
30374,sam,So they’re hooking you up with Billy.
30375,josh, Yeah. It’s a strange day when I’m involved with National Security.
30376,sam,I was just thinking the same thing.
30377,josh,You know what else?
30378,sam,What?
30379,josh,Tandy asked Amy to marry him.
30380,sam, Seriously?
30381,josh,Yeah. She said no.
30382,sam,Yeah.
30383,josh," That happened fast, don’t you think?"
30384,sam,"No, no. Don’t do this."
30385,josh,What?
30386,sam,I recognize this.
30387,josh,As what?
30388,sam,She didn’t break up with him for you. I guarantee it. She is a fully independent woman.  She’s the real thing. Stop looking at her different than you did yesterday.
30389,josh,I just said it was a little fast.
30390,sam,"The next thing that happens, you find a reason to be mad at her."
30391,josh,You’re wrong.
30392,sam,Guys like you?
30393,josh,Yeah?
30394,sam,I’m one of them.
30396,josh,Yeah?
30398,josh,"Billy, it’s Josh. Okay, just tell me a couple things first. Is everybody okay? Is anybody  hurt?"
30399,toby, This is Sam’s?
30400,bartlet,No. I reworked it.
30401,toby,"“...but a promise for all generations to follow.” Sir, I’ve read it twice, and I don’t  even know where you stand on affirmative action."
30402,bartlet,Yeah. I was trying to avoid a quote.
30403,toby,As well as nouns and pronouns.
30404,bartlet,It’s purposely nonspecific.
30405,toby,I don’t even know what we’re talking about.
30406,bartlet,"We get the word out to our friends, but I was obviously nodding in the direction of  affirmative action."
30407,toby,How about if we oppose affirmative action and get the word out to our friends you were  just kidding?
30408,bartlet,Nobody’s questioning where we stand.
30409,toby,Sir...
30410,bartlet,I don’t want to campaign today.
30411,toby, What happened to writing a new book?
30412,bartlet,"We will, but we don’t... Man, we don’t have to piss people off everyday in order to  demonstrate that we’re not..."
30413,toby,Yes.
30414,bartlet,"Look, we’re going to Iowa where we already won. I’m not ignoring the state, and I say  thank you for getting me elected in the first place, and we’re back on the plane. And  I’ll tell you what else. I don’t think it’s a good idea for us to be fighting for news  coverage with three governors, two senators, and the head of the church of I Hate You.  Let’s just get in under the radar."
30415,toby,"Yes, sir."
30416,bartlet,I’ll say a few words.
30417,toby,"Yes, sir."
30418,bartlet,That’s it.
30419,toby,"Thank you, Mr. President."
30420,c.j.,What’d he say?
30421,c.j.,They say something in the primary that force us to the left so that we have to...
30422,toby,Is that how it works?
30423,c.j.,Yes.
30424,toby,"Tell me more, Obi-Wan."
30425,c.j.,I’m saying...
30426,toby,He’s going to a college campus. It’s a pretty good time to talk about affirmative action  when it comes to admissions.
30427,c.j., Yeah.
30428,toby,What?
30429,c.j.,"Your father didn’t need affirmative action and neither did mine, and they were both  children of immigrants."
30430,toby,Your father needed the G.I. bill and so did mine.
30431,c.j., I’m the wrong Democrat to talk to about this.
30432,toby,Why?
30433,c.j.,"‘Cause...  After my father fought in Korea, he became what this government begs  every college graduate to become. He became a teacher, and he raised a family on a  teachers salary. And he paid his taxes, and always crossed at the green. And anytime  there was an opportunity for career advancement, it took an extra five years because  invariably there is a less-qualified black woman in the picture, so instead of retiring  as superintendent of the Ohio Valley Union Free School District, he retired head of the  math department at William Henry Harrison Junior High."
30434,toby,How is he these days?
30435,c.j.,Who?
30436,toby,Your dad.
30437,c.j., He’s fine.
30438,josh,We got cut off.
30439,leo,We know.
30440,josh,Why a few hours?
30441,leo,For the weather to clear.
30442,josh,Excuse me?
30443,josh,Then you get on the phone with him.
30444,josh,This isn’t a hostage situation. It’s a legitimate protest.
30445,josh,"You’re free. Excuse me, sir. You’re free to arrest them or shoot them, but we won’t  because it’s bad politics. Let’s just remember what the thing is here."
30446,josh,"Puerto Rico lived under Spain for four centuries, under the U.S. for one. In 500 years,  it hasn’t determined its own destiny for five minutes. They’re using depleted uranium  shells--"
30447,josh,"--napalm, cluster bombs. Vieques has a cancer rate 25% higher than the rest of Puerto  Rico. When is the time to be protesting? Tell me. I’ll tell them. They’ll do it."
30448,leo,We’ll need you in a few hours.
30449,josh,Hi.
30450,josh,I heard you overthrow the government.
30451,josh,Tell me about it.
30452,josh,Is there someone who can take care of Henry?
30453,josh,Nothing. I... love Henry. Is there someone that takes care of him when you go away?
30454,josh,What do you think about going away for a few days?
30455,josh,Tahiti... or Paris. Venice. We can go to Epcot if you want.
30456,josh,"Lie on the beach, dance at night, reggae, a little UB-40..."
30457,josh,They don’t have reggae in Tahiti?
30458,josh,I’m sorry?
30459,josh,We should.
30460,josh,Day after tomorrow.
30461,josh,Okay.
30462,josh,I’m buying plane tickets right now. I’m making reservations.
30463,josh,I’m going.
30464,josh,"I’m saying when I walk out that door, I’m buying plane tickets."
30465,josh,I’m going fast now.
30467,sam,Yes.
30469,sam,You want to be chosen for a jury?
30471,sam,"All right. Well, the lawyers are gonna ask you some general questions, and..."
30473,sam,Do you know any reason why you can’t render an impartial verdict?
30475,sam,Do you have any prejudices or feelings that might influence the jury in rendering a  verdict?
30477,sam,Yeah. The judge is gonna throw you in jail.
30478,sam,Here I go.
30479,sam,Bob?
30480,sam,How’ve you been?
30481,sam," Hey, you know what? You remember that UFO you were tracking over Maui? Turned out  to be an abandoned Russian satellite. One of its rockets didn’t fire, so it couldn’t  reenter."
30482,sam,"No, really."
30483,sam," Why don’t we get to it, Bob?"
30484,sam,Where is that?
30485,sam,Talk to the Treasury Department.
30486,sam,Why do you want to tour Fort Knox?
30487,sam,Really?
30488,sam,Who brought it to your attention?
30489,sam," A human friend, or...?"
30490,sam,"Well, I’ll pass that along."
30491,sam,Bob...
30492,sam,No.
30493,sam,You think there’s something funny going on?
30494,sam,With what?
30495,sam,I won’t get sucked into this.
30496,sam,I won’t get sucked into this.
30497,sam,There’s no such thing.
30498,sam,This is like Dungeons and Dragons camp all over again. We tested U-2 planes in Area 51.
30499,sam,"I’ve got news for you. Ten years ago, the Secretary of the Air Force concluded an  exhausted search of records."
30500,sam,It was balloon research.
30501,sam,They were anthropomorphic dummies.
30502,sam,Excuse me.  When did your dad pass away?
30503,sam,When did he pass away?
30504,sam,Excuse me.
30505,josh,Listen...
30506,sam,"I’m sorry, but I’m in there with this guy. You wouldn’t believe it. He insists the  government is concealing evidence of extraterrestrial contact, and we’ve got it at  Fort Knox."
30507,josh,"We were able to make a deal with Billy. They’ll pull off the island right away. In  exchange, we meet with a delegation, political affairs, Navy..."
30508,sam,It’s not gonna look like we caved?
30509,josh,"We’ll be slapped by the right, but they’re not gonna want to piss off the Latinos."
30510,sam,Good.
30511,josh,You know what else? I’m going to Tahiti with Amy.
30512,sam,You’re kidding.
30513,josh,"Day after tomorrow.  So this, this guy..."
30514,sam,"Yeah, the thing is... he kind of inherited the family business."
30515,josh,I-I gotta go online and buy Tahitian things.
30516,sam,Okay.
30517,sam,Bob?
30518,sam, I was just talking to... Let’s just say I talked to an associate. This associate  has higher clearance than I do.
30519,sam,"You can keep pursuing this, and I imagine you will, but we can’t give you the proper  paperwork you’ll need to audit the vault.  You understand?"
30520,sam,Do you?
30521,sam,"Yeah... Listen. These two Congressmen, they’re Democrats?"
30522,sam,I understand. Thank you very much.
30523,toby,It’s happening again.
30524,c.j.,Toby...
30525,toby,It is.
30526,c.j.,He was good.
30527,toby,"No, he wasn’t."
30528,c.j.,He was what he was supposed to be.
30529,toby,He was Uncle Fluffy. It’s Dr. Jekyll and Uncle Fluffy all over again.
30530,c.j.,"He said he wasn’t gonna respond to Ritchie, and I totally agree that it’s too early."
30531,toby,He was asked the question. He was asked the question.
30532,toby, No word on the Republicans?
30533,c.j.,"Oh, that’d be too much to hope for."
30534,toby,"There’s an old expression: “Quando dio, ole castigarci ci manda, quello che desideriamo.”  When the gods wish to punish us, they answer our prayers.  Anyway, he’s doing it  again."
30535,josh,You wanted me?
30536,leo,Yeah. It’s all set up.
30537,josh,The meeting?
30538,leo,Yeah.
30539,josh,This is great. Good is gonna come from this.
30540,leo,Maybe.
30541,josh,"Maybe. Yeah, but how often do you get to..."
30542,leo,Yeah.
30543,josh,When’s the meeting?
30544,leo,Day after tomorrow.
30545,josh, You’re kidding.
30546,leo,No.
30547,josh,Perfect.
30548,leo,We wanted to do it right away.
30549,josh,Yeah.
30550,leo,What’s the problem?
30551,josh,Nothing.
30552,leo,What’s the problem?
30553,josh,There’s a woman I’ve been...
30554,leo,Amy Gardner.
30555,josh, Yeah.
30556,leo,I hear things.
30557,josh,I know.
30558,leo,"I try to forget them quickly, but..."
30559,josh,We were supposed to... This is ridiculous. We were supposed to go away.
30560,leo,Where?
30561,josh,It doesn’t matter. We just... We’ve been having trouble getting together on...  Day after tomorrow?
30562,leo,Go.
30563,josh,I can’t.
30564,leo,Go.
30565,josh,I need to be here for this.
30566,leo,"No, you don’t."
30567,josh,Don’t worry about it.
30568,leo,My wife lives in my house. I live in a hotel. And this is why.
30569,josh,Yeah. Okay. I-I’m glad it’s taken care of. I’m glad we got the meeting.
30570,leo,Okay.
30572,josh,Yeah.
30574,josh,"It’s jury duty. It’s not appendectomy. It’s jury duty. Do it, don’t do it, but if you  don’t do it, you don’t get to complain about the O.J. verdict."
30575,josh,Amy?
30576,josh,Yeah.
30577,josh,I can’t go day after tomorrow.
30578,josh,"I mean I can go another time, but I can’t go day after tomorrow."
30579,josh,"It was pretty sudden for anybody, Amy."
30580,josh,"There was a problem in Vieques today, and we came to a good resolution, and it involves  a meeting day after tomorrow."
30581,josh,Yeah. No. He’s not. I want to stay.
30582,josh,"For one thing, it involves a friend of mine, and he did something he didn’t want to do,  and... Look, I just want to make sure his back is covered."
30583,josh,I’m not.
30584,josh,"I do, and when you’re done comparison-shopping, give me a call."
30586,josh,Yeah.
30588,toby,"You know, after slavery and voting rights, if the occasional Caucasian loses a  promotion..."
30589,c.j.,I think we’re gonna have to agree to disagree.
30590,toby,I don’t like doing that. 
30591,toby,"Ginger, you got it?"
30592,c.j.,You phoned ahead for research?
30593,toby,Sure. This is Washington on the need for a national university.
30594,c.j.,I’m pretty tired.
30595,toby,It’s brief.
30596,c.j.,"Toby, please."
30597,c.j.,"He said, “We banished discrimination from our laws. Now let’s banish discrimination from  our minds and hearts.”"
30598,toby,Who?
30599,c.j.,"The President in Iowa. He said, “Let’s banish discrimination from our minds and hearts.”  How is affirmative action doing that?"
30600,toby,I’m talking about college admissions.
30601,c.j.,I’m talking about my father.
30602,toby,Why?
30603,c.j.,‘Cause he’s not doing fine. He forgets things.  He forgets things.
30604,toby, He’s not a young guy anymore.
30605,c.j.,I’m not talking about dates and phone numbers.
30606,toby, I know.
30607,c.j.,"He forgets what’s going on. He thought this was the general election today, and...  he snaps back in, but...  And he’s gotta watch me bopping around  on Air Force One."
30608,sam,Hey! Welcome back.
30609,c.j.,"Sam, have you ever seen the butter cow at the Four-H Convention?"
30610,sam,I have. And the butter Last Supper with the butter?
30611,c.j.,Yes.
30612,sam, You know what the Bob Engler meeting turned out to be?
30613,toby,This is the UFO guy?
30614,sam,Yeah. He thinks the government is keeping alien bodies at the Bullion Depository in Fort  Know. What are we keeping in the Bullion Depository in Fort Knox?
30615,c.j., Soup?
30616,sam,"No, seriously. There used to be 8500 metric tons of gold there, now most of them’s moved  out."
30617,c.j.,Yeah.
30618,sam,What’s there now?
30619,toby,"I wouldn’t ask a lot of questions, Sam."
30620,sam,What do you mean?
30621,toby,Don’t worry about it.
30622,sam,Okay. I’m going back to my office. 
30623,toby, Call him. 
30624,josh,Coming.
30625,josh,Thanks for coming.  Something’s wrong with the lights. Let me feel  around for a switch here.
30626,josh,"A little piece of Tahiti right here in Georgetown. Would you like a Samoan Fog Cutter  or a Navy Grog? A Samoan Fog Cutter has three kinds of rum, including Bacardi 451 and...   the difference between that and a Navy Grog is..."
30627,josh,Into what?
30628,josh, Yeah. Good thinking.
30629,josh,I don’t want to turn on the news.
30630,toby,Good evening sir.
30631,bartlet,I thought you’d gone home.
30632,toby,I was just watching some of the coverage.
30633,bartlet,It’s gonna be Ritchie.
30634,toby,Yeah.
30635,bartlet,I mean it’s gonna be Ritchie.
30636,toby,I know.
30637,bartlet,"It would have been, I don’t know, it would have seemed obnoxious. It would’ve seemed  like grandstanding.  You want some bourbon?"
30638,toby,"Thank you, sir."
30639,bartlet, What do you think?
30640,toby,"I was a telemarketer for about a week. I can’t remember what we were selling, but you  worked off a script. “Hi. Good evening. My name is...” And “Toby Ziegler” was okay for  New York, but once I got into the other time zones, I needed a name. I wasn’t gonna  bother anybody."
30641,bartlet,"Toby, if you have something to say, please say it."
30642,toby,Ritchie’s good for all time zones.
30643,bartlet, My family signed the Declaration of Independence. You think I’ve got an ethnicity  problem?
30644,toby,"Well, the line isn’t between light skin and dark skin."
30645,bartlet,Yeah?
30646,toby, It’s between educated and masculine... or Eastern Academic Elite and Plain-Spoken.
30647,bartlet,It’s always been like that.
30648,toby,"Yeah, but a funny thing happened when the White House got demystified. The impression  was left that anybody could do it."
30649,bartlet,You’re not telling me anything I don’t know.
30650,toby,"It’s one thing that Ritchie came out for the Pennsylvania Referendum today, but the  manner in which he articulated it. His presence, the clear sign he wasn’t personally  engaged with the facts."
30651,bartlet,Toby...
30652,toby,"His staff was cringing, I promise you, and we let it go."
30653,bartlet,It wasn’t the moment to go.
30654,toby,You were asked the question.
30655,bartlet, Do you have anything else?
30656,toby," Sir, I don’t think I need to tell you that the level of respect with which the  staff speaks of you doesn’t change, depending on whether or not you’re in the room."
30657,bartlet,But?
30658,toby,"Well, there’s always been a concern... about the two Bartlets.  The absent-minded  professor with the “Aw, Dad” sense of humor. Disarming and unthreatening. Good for all  time zones. And the Nobel Laureate. Still searching for salvation. Lonely, frustrated.  Lethal."
30659,bartlet,You’re gonna sing a country western song?
30660,toby,The one whose father never liked him because he was too smart.
30661,bartlet, This stopped being fun for me a little while ago.
30662,toby,Sir?
30663,bartlet,It was actually never fun for me. I was just being polite.
30664,toby," Your father used to hit you, didn’t he, Mr. President?"
30665,bartlet, Excuse me?
30666,toby,"Your father used to hit you, sir?"
30667,bartlet, Yeah.
30668,toby,Not like a spanking.
30669,bartlet,He hit me. Why?
30670,toby,He punched you.
30671,bartlet,I’m done being polite now.
30672,toby,"He did it because you made him mad, but you didn’t know why."
30673,bartlet,"Toby, it was a complicated relationship. Can I help you?"
30674,toby,It was because you were smarter than he was.
30675,bartlet,It was a complicated relationship.
30676,toby,"He didn’t like you, sir. That’s why he hit you. That’s why people hit each other.  He didn’t like you. You were smarter than he was."
30677,bartlet,Why are we talking about this?
30678,toby,"So maybe if you get enough votes, win one more election, maybe your father will--"
30679,bartlet,"You have stepped WAY over the line, and any other President would have your ass on the  sidewalk right now."
30680,toby,"Yes, sir."
30681,bartlet,"They would’ve had you on the sidewalk a long time ago.  I don’t know what the  hell goes on in a Brooklyn shrink’s office, but get it the hell out of my house!"
30682,toby,"Thank you, Mr. President."
30683,josh,Stanley.
30684,josh,Your flight was all right?
30685,josh,How are you?
30686,josh,Yeah?
30687,josh, These are your things?
30688,josh, I'm going to put them back in my office.
30689,josh,No. I'll be right back.
30690,josh,They'll be all right back there.
30691,josh,You ever seen the White House?
30692,josh,Follow me.
30693,josh, This is the communications bullpen where Toby Ziegler and Sam Seaborn  work. The rest of the ommunications and speech-writing work across the alley in the Old  Executive Office Building.
30694,josh,And here comes the actual Sam Seaborn. What's going on?
30695,sam,"Leo's reading it, and we're going to send it out in about ten to fifteen minutes so Toby's  been banging around."
30696,josh,What are you doing?
30697,sam,Banging around.
30698,josh, This Dr. Keyworth.
30699,sam,Sam Seaborn. 
30700,sam,Did you have a good flight?
30701,sam,Anybody you know on the plane?
30702,sam,Okay.  I'll see you.
30703,josh," Uh... that's Leo's office. It has  a private entrance into the Oval Office, but we'll go in here."
30704,josh,What?
30705,josh,"Yeah, he wanted to know if you had talked to anybody on the way here."
30706,josh, This is the Oval Office.
30707,josh,"That's the Resolute Desk. It was built from the timbers of the H.M.S. Resolute and given to  Rutherford Hayes by Queen Victoria to thank the U.S. for finding the abandoned ship.   We're going to go over to the residence, but I'm going to take you out through the portico."
30708,josh,Yeah?
30709,josh,Yeah.
30710,josh,You don't think this is interesting?
30711,josh,"If somebody sees us, I'd like for them to see me giving you a tour."
30712,josh,"It was designed by an Irish architect named James Hoban, who won the job in an open  competition. It was built largely by slaves. They just found the pay receipts a few  weeks ago."
30713,josh,Their owners.  Right through here.
30714,josh,Yeah.  We're gonna go in here now. This is the President's private study.
30715,josh,Yeah.
30716,josh,"No, that's all right."
30717,josh,Good.
30718,leo,Stanley.
30719,leo,Getting a tour of the place?
30720,leo,You show him the North Portico?
30721,josh,Leo likes to show people the soot stains on the North Portico.
30722,leo,From when the British torched the place.
30723,leo,"Not that. You know when Dolly Madison heard the cannon fire, she evacuated the building,  but she already had the table set for a forty-person dinner party. So the British soldiers  ate, then they set the building on fire."
30724,leo, How was your flight? 
30725,leo,Did you know anyone on the plane?
30726,leo,No.
30727,leo, We'll leave you alone.
30728,bartlet, The speech is going out?
30729,leo,In a few minutes.
30730,bartlet,Okay. 
30731,bartlet,I'm Jed Bartlet.
30732,bartlet,I guess we knew that?
30733,bartlet,I've been having trouble sleeping.
30734,bartlet,"You understand that this is an election here, right? I mean by itself who cares?  The President's having trouble sleeping, he talks to a doctor, but with the MS and the  hearings and you're a psychiatrist..."
30735,bartlet, Okay.
30736,bartlet,Yeah.
30737,bartlet,"Yeah, we know you. You helped Josh out last year?"
30738,bartlet,"Me, too."
30739,bartlet,How would I know?
30740,bartlet,Thank you. 
30741,bartlet,I can't sleep.
30742,bartlet,I stay awake.
30743,bartlet,Four nights.
30744,bartlet,Right.
30745,bartlet,Yeah.
30746,bartlet,The third night.
30747,bartlet,Not 'til the next morning in the middle of a national security briefing.
30748,bartlet," Stanley, I think you're under-selling yourself when you say you're not an  expert in sleep disoders. 'Cause you've been right straight on the money so far. "
30749,bartlet, Not many.
30750,bartlet,Never has before.
30751,bartlet," You think if I put this out, I'm gonna fall asleep?"
30752,bartlet,Then let's move on.
30753,bartlet,No.
30754,bartlet,No.
30755,bartlet,No.
30756,bartlet,"I'm sorry. Before we get to lifestyle factors, I'm just gonna turn this on. "
30757,bartlet,When we're done writing it.
30758,c.j., I'm sorry?
30759,c.j.,Sunday night.
30760,c.j.,I imagine we'll be getting their reviews any minute.
30761,c.j.,Key members of House and Senate Foreign Relations.
30762,c.j.,You see it Sunday night. That's it everybody. That's a full lid. Have a good weekend.
30763,c.j.,"Hey, what are you doing here?"
30764,c.j.,Who?
30765,c.j.,Isn't Billy in the Congo?
30766,c.j.,Come back here.
30767,c.j.,Does he miss deadlines?
30768,c.j.,What does State say?
30769,c.j.,What about the other end?
30770,c.j.,What do you think has happened?
30771,c.j.,Without written permission from the Ministry?
30772,c.j.,By reading State background notes.
30773,c.j.,No.
30774,c.j.,I know.
30775,c.j.,"Well, I'm going to go talk to Leo."
30776,c.j.,"I don't care that he's been... Look, I'm going to get into this, but if he's missed two  deadlines, then his fifteen minutes was yesterday."
30777,c.j.,I'd call his wife.
30778,leo,Toby?
30779,toby,Yeah?
30780,leo,The pacing.
30781,toby,Yeah.
30782,leo,"Okay, now the standing still is bothering me a little bit."
30783,toby, This is the fifth time you're reading it. Are there words in there you  don't understand?
30784,toby,"Of course there wouldn't be, 'cause you can't rise to a position like yours without.. "
30785,toby,"Look, this is exactly what we said we wanted it to be. We said we were tired of reading  about the President's scattershot foreign policy. We said - you want to fillet me for this,  fine - we said when we go to the U.N., we were gonna..."
30786,leo,I think it's great.
30787,toby,We said we were gonna... Yeah?
30788,leo,"I do.  You know your wife's going to have something to say about it, though."
30789,toby,My ex-wife.
30790,leo,Yeah.
30791,toby,Why do you call her my wife?
30792,leo,It bothers you.
30793,toby,Everything bothers me.
30794,leo,Yeah.
30795,toby,But you pick that?
30796,leo,"Yeah.  Toby, the night of the Iowa Caucus when you got back, did you and  the President have a... conversation that night?"
30797,toby,"Yeah. I... When he got back, for a minute."
30798,leo,What did you talk about?
30799,toby,Nothing.
30800,leo,He seemed kind of upset about it.
30801,toby,It didn't go well.
30802,leo,What was it?
30803,toby,It was personal.
30804,leo,It was personal?
30805,toby,Yeah.
30806,leo,"Well, that always works well with him."
30807,toby,What has he said about the speech?
30808,leo, He thinks it's great. He hasn't said anything to you?
30809,toby,We haven't talked in a little while.
30810,leo,"Toby, what the hell went on in there?"
30811,toby,Don't worry about it.
30812,leo,Okay. I'm gonna to read this again.
30813,toby,"Sure, 'cause it's the sixth time."
30814,leo,Yeah.
30815,c.j.,Hey.
30816,toby,Did you read it?
30817,c.j.,It's great.
30818,toby,Thank you.
30819,c.j.,Someone's going to get an ass-kicking from the missus.
30820,toby,Listen-
30821,leo,"It's what we asked for, you know? We're gonna have to get ready for it."
30822,c.j.,Yeah... something else has come up though.
30823,leo,What?
30824,c.j.,"Leonard Wallace just came to see me. Billy Price is on assignment in the Congo, and he  missed two deadlines. he hasn't gotten anywhere with State. The embassy in Kinshasa  confirmed that a Belgian tv crew shooting outside Goma saw an American captured by MaiMai  rebels."
30825,leo,"Hasn't State had a travel advisory out for, like ten years?"
30826,c.j.,Twenty-four.
30827,leo,What the hell is he doing there?
30828,c.j.,Reporting a story no one is paying attention to.
30829,leo,Why don't we talked to the Congolese attache?
30830,c.j.,He's on his way.
30831,leo,Okay.
30832,toby, He liked it.
30833,sam, Yeah?
30834,toby,He liked it alot. Mostly what I wrote. Not so much what you wrote. 
30835,sam,Yeah? So how long do you think before the old lady comes by to give you a whooping?
30836,toby,"Her office called already, didn't they?"
30837,sam,"You bet, baby."
30838,toby,"You probably want to rethink calling me ""baby,"" right?"
30839,sam, Yeah.
30840,sam,"Whoa, Nellie!"
30841,sam,"Hayes, you could make a good dog break his leash."
30842,sam,Americans for the Preservation of Family Values and White People?
30843,sam,A hootenanny. 
30844,sam,Yes. 32-50 is a consolidated appropriations act that we want to drop in the U.N. speech  for Monday morning. I need you to review the final legislative language so we can shop it  around the Hill over the weekend.
30845,sam,"Uh, I don't know."
30846,sam,It authorizes payment of nine hundred and twenty-six million in U.N. dues over three years  for an exchange in the reduction of U.N. bureaucracy as well as peace-keeping assessments  by the General Assembly.
30847,sam,"Well, the language was drafted by Republicans."
30848,sam,I just want you to look for legal land mines.
30849,sam,"I don't know. A ban on German food, or hidden amendment saying how annoying the French are."
30850,sam, Why don't you write that suggestion in the margins?
30851,sam, Whoa. I didn't even see that thing from the back.
30852,bartlet, Like what?
30853,bartlet,Nah.
30854,bartlet,No.
30855,bartlet,Noise?
30856,bartlet,Planes aren't allowed to fly over the White House.
30857,bartlet,Right.
30858,bartlet,Four or five hours.
30859,bartlet,Psychological factors.
30860,bartlet,What were the odds?
30875,sam, Ginger?
30876,sam,Is Bonnie here?
30877,sam,Have we met?
30878,sam,Sam Seaborn. You're one of the people who was sent over for the week?
30879,sam,We appreciated your helping out.
30880,sam,No.
30881,sam,What woman?
30882,sam,That was Ainsley Hayes. She's an Assicioate Counsel.
30883,sam,What did I do?
30884,sam,"No, we're friends. It's a completely mature... you know... Also, she started it."
30885,sam,Well... Okay. 
30886,sam,I wasn't demeaning her. I was complimenting her.
30887,sam,She looked good in that dress I thought.
30888,sam,Congresswoman?
30889,sam,Toby?
30890,sam,I do not know.
30891,sam,You want to talk about the speech?
30892,sam,No.
30893,sam,"I was having a good night until, like, three minutes ago."
30894,sam,I don't know.
30895,sam,"But, you've asked me again and I still didn't know."
30896,sam,Better his than mine.
30897,sam,What were we talking about?
30898,sam,And you say Ginger and Bonnie are out getting something to eat?
30899,toby,I need these distributed.
30900,sam,Andi's in your office.
30901,toby, You let her in my office?
30902,sam,Yeah.
30903,toby,What the hell did you let her in my office for?
30904,sam,"Okay, well, I'm going to step out for a minute and... not be in this area anymore."
30905,toby,Come on in.
30906,toby," We consulted plenty of people. What do you think, Sam and I create  foreign policy around here?"
30907,toby,We brought in... For three weeks...
30908,toby,Yes.
30909,toby,The Secretary of State. Since when did you get to come in here?
30910,toby,"This is a Presidential address, Andrea, not a camel."
30911,toby,A camel. A horse built by committee.
30912,toby,I read it.
30913,toby,In fact I wrote it.
30914,toby,Andi...
30915,toby,Yes.
30916,toby,You getting nervous?
30917,toby,A little nervous?
30918,c.j.,Billy's wife is already here. She's in my office right now.
30919,leo,Is she very upset?
30920,c.j.,She's...
30921,leo,Send him in.
30922,c.j.,She's with Leonard.
30923,leo,Come in.
30924,leo,"Everybody, this McKennen Loboko the Congolese atache."
30925,leo,"I'm sorry. Mr. Loboko, you know our situation. We've got an American reporter who we  believe was taken by the Maimais."
30926,c.j.,"The MaiMais care about proper documentation, do they?"
30927,c.j.,"If his paper were in order, he wouldn't have been abducted at gunpoint?"
30928,c.j.,"I'm C.J. Cregg. I'm the White House Press Secretary. That guy sat in my room for a year,  his wife's sitting in my office, his two kids are sitting at home, and I want him back."
30929,c.j.,"This is a shakedown, so tell us how much money, and where does it go."
30930,c.j.,The Congolese government is a myth.
30931,leo,Mr. Loboko... How much money and wher does it go?
30932,josh, Where have you been?
30934,josh,For an hour?
30936,josh,"There's an editorial on sugar subsidies in the International Herald-Tribune. Make sure  Leo's got a copy. Also, make sure you send me home with a Congressional facebook."
30938,josh,I'm still mixing up Cooper and Hooper.
30940,josh,'Cause Cooper sounds a lot like Hooper. What does it matter? Just...
30942,josh, What do you mean?
30944,josh,No.
30946,josh,That's where you were?
30948,josh,At a job interview?
30950,josh,What's the job?
30952,josh,What kind of site?
30954,josh,Issues Director?
30956,josh,For an internet start-up.
30958,josh,Really?
30960,josh,"Sounds like the hype's alive and well, too."
30962,josh,You suppose.
30964,josh, You can't be thinking about taking a job that may not be  around a year from now?
30966,josh,He offered you money?
30968,josh,"Well, all I can offfer you is a title bump."
30970,josh,Senior Assistance to the Deputy Chief of Staff for Strategic Planning.
30972,josh,"Then I can't offer you a title bump. The sugar subsidy editorial and the facebook, okay?  Cooper and Hooper."
30973,sam,What do you need?
30974,sam,What?
30975,sam, Mm.
30976,sam,"Let me ask you something. Before, when I said that you were enough to make a good dog  break his leash, you understand that men, we're the dog, right? I was the dog?"
30977,sam,Okay.
30978,sam,I meant it to make you feel good.
30979,sam,Although I certainly meant it.
30980,sam,I didn't mean to demean you.
30981,sam,Okay.
30982,sam,Yeah.
30983,sam,I was told that I demeaned you.
30984,sam,I was told that I did.
30985,sam,By someone named Celia.
30986,sam,You sure?
30987,sam,Terrific.
30988,sam,I'll rewrite them now. You'll stick around?
30989,sam, I don't like to pry.
30990,toby,"Well, we'd like to talk to them about it."
30991,toby,It's worth a shot.
30992,toby,Neither foes the speech. It calls fanaticism fanaticism.
30993,toby,"It's fanaticism whether we call it that or not, so were going to call it that. We respect  all religions, all cultures."
30994,toby,"Yes, to a point. Grotesque oppression isn't okay just because it's been institutionlised.  If you ask me, I think we should have gotten into the game three, four decades ago, but  they're coming after us now, so it's time to saddle up."
30995,toby,We do know what's right.
30996,toby,There's a lot of reasons why they hate us. You know when they're gonna like us? When we win.
30997,c.j.,Okay...
30998,c.j.,"Janet, we're working some back channels right now. I think if you can make yourself  comfortable here, we might some news in an hour or so."
30999,c.j.,"No, we can't buy them off directly, but what we do is, we offer to withhold money from  their enemies."
31000,c.j.,Your husband is employed by a billion dollar corporation.
31001,c.j.,"Let's not get that far right now. Listen, your clothes are wet. Can I get you some..."
31002,c.j., Okay. Okay.
31003,c.j.,Yeah. 
31004,bartlet,No.
31005,bartlet,"Well, Congress was investigating me."
31006,bartlet,And I was censured. Then I had to give the State of the Union.
31007,bartlet,I'm running for reelection.
31008,bartlet,"Things are blowing up everywhere, and I have chosen the General Assembly of the U.N.  to define a tougher foreign policy. Not unusually stressful, no."
31009,bartlet,"I don't like the word ""stress"". It's a Madison Avenue word. It's something that can be  cured with flavored coffee and bath bubbles."
31010,bartlet,"I have a job I like, and my family's healthy. "
31011,bartlet,Stress is for other people.
31012,bartlet,"I'm saying it's not stress. I was feeling stressed five nights ago, too and I slept fine."
31013,bartlet,I want my money back.
31014,bartlet,I get that a lot.
31015,bartlet,"So, what do you charge?"
31016,bartlet,"For three hundred and seventy-five dollars an hour, you ought to bring your own damn  lingerie."
31017,bartlet,"There's a great story about Arthur Miller. ""Death of a Salesman"" had just opened on  Broadway the night before, and he was walking around his old neighborhood in Brooklyn  and he see's a hot dog vendor that he went to high school with, and he says, ""Hey, Jimmy,  it's me, Arthur Miller."" And the hot dog vendor says, ""Artie, how you doing? What you  been up to?"" And Miller says, ""I'm, you know, I'm a playwright."" And the hot dog vendor  says, ""Hmm, play writing, I should've gone into that."" Three hundred and seventy-five  dollars an hour."
31018,bartlet,For what?
31019,bartlet,I can't sleep. I can't sleep. I'll be tired and I'll lie there and it doesn't happen.
31020,bartlet,I won the Iowa Caucus.
31021,bartlet,That's not enough?
31022,bartlet,Say what you'd say to anyother patient.
31023,bartlet, I had a conversation with one of m aides that night after we got back from  Iowa. He called me on something.
31024,bartlet,"Well, I guess we talked about a lot of things. Who we think the Republican challenger is  gonna be be, and imcumbency and campaign stategy, strategic overview, but the long and  short of it is, my father never liked me at all. "
31025,bartlet,"Yeah, I'd thought you'd enjoy that."
31026,sam,Charlie?
31027,sam,Are you in pain?
31028,sam,Charlie?
31029,sam,Have you been playing basketball?
31030,sam,Did you get beat?
31031,sam,Charlie?
31032,sam,Who'd you play?
31033,sam,Ed?
31034,sam,Larry?
31035,sam,Jack?
31036,sam,Did you get beat by Manny?
31037,sam,Who?
31038,sam,Your sister?
31039,sam,Your little sister.
31040,sam,Girl's varsity.
31041,sam,"Man, you can't walk."
31042,sam,"Listen, I can tell you're down in the dumps, but let's talk about me."
31043,sam,"If your sister was getting ready for a night out, and I said, ""Deanna, you're enough to  make a good dog break his leash,"" would you think I was a cad?"
31044,sam,Hang on. Because of the sentiment or the expression?
31045,sam,Yeah.
31046,sam,You and how many Girl Scouts?
31047,sam,But if it wasn't your sister?
31048,sam, He says I'm fine.
31049,sam,Still?
31050,sam,We've been in this fight.
31051,sam,"Hang on. Here she is. Celia, I asked Ainsley and she said she didn't mind at all.  Plus, Charlie said he's fine with it."
31052,sam,Yes?
31053,sam,Yes.
31054,sam,"Yeah, I also thinks it's important to make clear I am not a sexist."
31055,sam, Stilettos?
31056,sam,I suppose I am.
31057,sam," Well, for the moment at least, I'm going to do what she's telling me to do."
31058,sam,Okay.
31067,toby,"It took... Andrea, it took three days to get the language through NSC and the NSA."
31068,toby,It isn't coming out of the speech.
31069,toby,Then why were we here for an hour?
31070,toby, Sure.
31071,toby," ""Our goal is neither to preach nor proclaim American values. We have deep  respect for our Islamic brothers and sisters and we have a great deal to learn from  the values of... tolerence and faith that are deeply held throughout the Islamic world.""  So this is your way of saying any resemblance the previous paragraph may have had to  foreign policy is purely coincidental?"
31072,toby,Guess what? 
31073,toby,Our goal is to proclaim American values.
31074,toby,"I think the President will decide what the speech is suppose to be about, but the  reality is, the United States of America no longer sucks up to reactionaries, and  our staunch allies will know what we mean."
31075,toby,"Nobody's blowing off the coalition, and that coalition will be plenty strong."
31076,toby,That's right.
31077,toby,"That freedom and democracy are coming soon to a theatre near them, so get dressed."
31078,toby,Not enough.
31079,toby,Be nice? 
31080,toby,"Well... How about when we, instead of blowing Iraq back to the seventh century for  harbouring terrorists and trying to develop nuclear weapons, we just imposed economic  sanctions and were reviled by the Arab world for not giving them a global charge card  and a free trade treaty? How about when we pushed Israel to give up land for peace?"
31081,toby,"How about when we sent American soldiers to protect Saudi Arabia, and the Arab world  told us we were desecrating their holy land? We'll ignore the fact that we were invited.  How about two weeks ago, in the State of the Union when the President praised the Islamic  people as faithful and hardworking only to be denounced in the Arab press as knowing  nothing about Islam? But none of that is the point."
31082,toby,"I don't remember having to explain to Italians that our problem wasn't with them, but  with Mussolini! Why does the U.S. have to take every Arab country out for an ice cream  cone? They'll like us when we win!"
31083,toby,"Thousands of madrassahs teaching children nothing, nothing, nothing but the Koran and to  hate America. Who do we see about that?  I'll like us when we win."
31084,toby,Let me take another look at the softer language.
31086,c.j.,"It's not money, actually, it's a promise to honor international sanctions against the  export of something called ""Col-Tan"" by the Rwandan Army."
31088,c.j.,"It's a mineral they have a lot of in Congo. When you refine it, it's a necessary component  of cell phones and pagers, and the Rwandans and Ugandans smuggle it illegally."
31089,josh,Listen.
31090,josh,"Akin Wamba, who's the Maimai rebel commander, sent word through a crew that was filming  in Goma."
31091,c.j.," Oh, God."
31092,josh,Yeah. He was killed in an ambush. Embassy Kinshasa's going to get the body.
31093,bartlet,I told you...
31094,bartlet,What's wrong with my head?
31095,bartlet,Of course not. That would be three hundred and eighty-five dollars an hour.
31096,bartlet,It's not good for a person to keep setting goals?
31097,bartlet,"Well, I'm told that most men lead lives of quiet desperation."
31098,bartlet,I have abilities.
31099,bartlet,I think I have.
31100,bartlet,I think you're talking about the Lincoln Bedroom.
31101,bartlet,That's not easy.
31102,bartlet,It's not easy.
31103,bartlet,I think I've made tough choices.
31104,bartlet,You don't know anything.
31105,bartlet,I'm not trying to get my father to like me.
31106,bartlet,What?
31107,bartlet,"Stanley, I hate to put it this way, but I'm me, and you're you, and we're done when I  say we're done."
31108,bartlet,Thank you! 
31109,bartlet,I'm sorry? 
31110,bartlet,"We spoke several times about Kashmir, and she assured me they're working towards a peaceful  resolution. We also had a spirited conversation about chess. "
31111,bartlet,"Chess was invented in India. Somewhere around 600 A.D., a gigantic chessboard was constructed  at Fatehpur Sikri which was the capital a long time ago, and human figures were used as chess  pieces. "
31112,c.j.," Hey, Leo. "
31113,leo,What's he doing? 
31114,c.j.,The history of chess by Dr. Josiah Bartlet. 
31115,leo,Get him in the car. 
31116,c.j.,What's going on? 
31117,leo,And get the press pool back here too. 
31118,c.j.,What's going on? 
31119,leo,China. 
31120,c.j.,Okay. 
31121,bartlet," In sandlewood, and a laquered classic Stanton in boxwood. "
31122,c.j.," Thank you, everybody. "
31123,bartlet, Hartsfield votes  in three hours and 21 minutes! We're gonna find out who the next President is. 
31124,bartlet,"I'm gonna give some of the chess sets out as gifts, did you see them? "
31125,c.j.,Leo needs you in the car. 
31126,bartlet,Did he say-? 
31127,c.j.,China. 
31128,bartlet,Yeah? 
31129,bartlet,What's going on? 
31130,leo,Intel says Taiwan's getting ready to test fire three Patriots. 
31131,bartlet,Where? 
31132,leo,A base on a island in the Pingdong region. 
31133,bartlet,What's China's reaction? 
31134,leo,An acceleration of integrated military exercises. 
31135,bartlet,Big? 
31136,leo,Yeah. 
31137,bartlet,How big? 
31138,leo,Unprecedented. Shall we tell Taiwan not to test the missles? Sir? 
31139,bartlet,"No. I mean, we could try, but they're not gonna go for it. "
31140,leo,They might. 
31141,bartlet,What are they asking for? 
31142,leo,They want us to put some hardware in the Taiwan Strait. 
31143,bartlet,Tonight? 
31144,leo,"Yes, sir. "
31145,bartlet,I'm assuming Nancy and Fitzwallace and the Chiefs...
31146,leo,"Everyone concurs, Mr. President. "
31147,bartlet,You? 
31148,leo,"Yes, sir. "
31149,bartlet,We have a pretty good sense of the worst-case scenario? 
31150,leo,We end up sending the largest US naval armada to South-East Asia since the end of Vietnam. 
31151,bartlet,That sounds right. 
31152,leo, Sir? 
31153,bartlet,"All right, we know the play. "
31154,leo,We're going to assemble in the Sit Room. 
31155,bartlet,She gave me these beautiful chess sets. 
31156,leo,The Prime Minister? 
31157,bartlet,Yeah. I'm on my way. Let Fitzwallace know I'm gonna order the Seventh Fleet into the Taiwan Strait. 
31158,leo,"Yes, sir. "
31159,bartlet, Let's go. 
31160,bartlet,Good evening. 
31161,bartlet,"Listen, they start voting in Hartsfield's landing in about two and a half hours, so this may  end up being somebody else's problem.  The scale of the war  games is unprecedented? "
31162,leo,What's the Taiwanese reaction so far? 
31163,leo,What about equipment movement? 
31164,leo, Super Cobras. 
31165,leo,The Nimitz? 
31166,leo,The Indepence? 
31167,leo,What other assets can be moved in? 
31168,leo,"'Kay, let me backtrack for a second. What's C.J. facing in the press room right now? "
31169,leo,Is the Carl Vinson close enough to make a detour to the South China Sea? 
31170,leo,Sir? 
31171,bartlet,That's our next move. 
31172,bartlet,After our next move comes their next move. 
31173,c.j.,Katie. 
31174,c.j.,"No, and it's important to remember that Patriot missles are defensive equipment which can only  be used in the event of an attack. "
31175,c.j.,I'm not in a position to say what's provoking the war games. Chris? 
31176,c.j.,"Actually, under the '79 Act we agreed to provide Taiwan with sufficient capability to defend  itself, but we're getting way ahead of ourselves. There's gonna be a Pentagon briefing at 10 AM. "
31177,c.j.,The President will be monitoring the situation in the China Seas as well as Hartsfield's  Landing. Any of the new people not know about Hartsfield's Landing? 
31178,c.j.,"Hartsfield's Landing is a town in New Hampshire, population 63. While the rest of New Hampshire  goes to the polls at 8 AM tomorrow, all of the 42 registered voters of Hartsfield vote at one  minute past midnight or...   It's all part of the service here at Claudia's house of useless knowledge. That's a full lid,  thank you very much. "
31179,c.j.,"Ironically, neither of them had ever been to a major league baseball game when they wrote  that song. The other song they were famous for was? "
31180,c.j.,"""Shine on Harvest Moon"". "
31181,c.j.,Charlie.  What are those? 
31182,c.j.,I need a copy of the President's private schedule. 
31183,c.j.,I need another. 
31184,c.j.,I'm sorry? 
31185,c.j., What the hell is this? 
31186,c.j.,I've got to sign it out? 
31187,c.j.,I'm the Press Secretary. 
31188,c.j.,Gimme the damn schedule 
31189,c.j., The anal-retentive side of you is not gonna to help you get girls. 
31190,josh,Donna! 
31191,josh,Donna! 
31193,josh,You know...
31195,josh,You were taking your time. 
31197,josh,"Do you remember Jennifer Flender, the daughter of the mom and pop who have the tackle shop? "
31199,josh,Yes. 
31201,josh,The daughter just e-mailed me and told me her parents are voting for Ritchie. 
31203,josh,She e-mails me. 
31205,josh,'Cause she's got a little crush on me. 
31207,josh,She's twenty years old. 
31209,josh,He lives in New Hampshire. 
31211,josh,"It doesn't matter. Mom and pop are voting for Ritchie, and they vote in Hartsfield's Landing.  You gotta talk to them. "
31213,josh,I'm not kidding. Two votes could be the margin. 
31215,josh,Yeah. 
31217,josh,We're not. 
31219,josh,That are cast at 12:01 and counted at 12:07. The rest of New Hampshire doesn't come in until  nine PM. That's 21 hours of the news having nothing to report but the winner at Hartsfield's  Landing. I want it to be us. You have to get on the phone and talk to the Flenders. 
31221,josh,"They liked you. They took you in, they fed you. "
31223,josh,"You were pretty pathetic, and the Fenders fed you. "
31225,josh,"See, you remember their name. There's obviously a connection. "
31227,josh, Politics in New Hampshire is what? 
31229,josh,"Thank you. Get on the phone, find out what their problem with the President is, and solve it. "
31231,josh,Why? 
31233,josh,Sad but true. You know what I'm thinking? 
31235,josh,"Cell phone, Lafayette Park, and a warm coat. "
31237,josh,It's a good coat. 
31239,josh,I'm cool. 
31240,bartlet,Excuse me. 
31241,sam," Mr. President, welcome back. "
31242,bartlet,Thank you. How are you? 
31243,sam,"I'm fine, sir, I was just... someone gave me this chess set. "
31244,bartlet,"Yeah, it's from me. "
31245,sam,You're kidding? 
31246,bartlet,"The Prime Minister gave me a few different sets, and I wanted to give them as gifts. "
31247,sam,"I'm really overwhelmed by this, Mr. President. "
31248,bartlet,The State of the Union was really something else. 
31249,sam,"Thank you again, sir. "
31250,bartlet,"This one's a Lotus set, hand-carved camel-bone. She told me it came to her from a direct  descendent of Tan Sen. You know who that was? "
31251,sam,No. 
31252,bartlet,The greatest musician of his time. 
31253,sam,What time was that? 
31254,bartlet,"Sixteenth century. He'd go to the human chess matches at the Mogul Court of Emperor Akbar,  and that began the family obsession with the game. Wanna play? "
31255,sam,You? 
31256,bartlet,Yeah. 
31257,sam,I'll get killed. 
31258,bartlet,Why? 
31259,sam,You're a Grand Wizard or a Grandmaster or something. 
31260,bartlet,"No, I'm none of those things. I'm just grand. "
31261,bartlet," You're white, but don't ever touch me. "
31262,sam,"I'm sorry, sir. "
31263,bartlet,I was kidding. 
31264,bartlet,"Ah, the Fibonacci opening. Very interesting. "
31265,sam,"You're just gonna mess with me this whole time, right? "
31266,bartlet,Yeah. 
31267,sam,So India went well? 
31268,bartlet,Yeah. 
31269,sam,A standing ovation on the floor of the Stock Exchange. 
31270,bartlet,A billion dollars at the Export-Import Bank didn't hurt. 
31271,sam,I suppose. 
31272,bartlet,"Three billion in direct foreign investment to the forty-four billion China gets. You're an  American, where would you rather put your money? "
31273,sam,India. 
31274,bartlet,Why? 
31275,sam,They're Democratic... English-speaking. There's the rule of law. Better since Cuba. 
31276,bartlet,That's right. 
31277,sam,Do you mind my asking how bad it's getting out there tonight? 
31278,bartlet,"It's bad. If Kashmir's the most dangerous place on earth, the second most dangerous is the  Taiwan Strait. Taiwan's got four hundred thousand troops on high alert; the size of China's  war games is unprecedented. "
31279,sam,Have you thought about asking Taiwan to call off the Patriot tests? 
31280,bartlet,You think I should? 
31281,sam,"No, sir. "
31282,bartlet,Why not? 
31283,sam,"Because China's if got three hundred missiles pointed at Taiwan, why shouldn't they be able  to defend themselves? "
31284,bartlet,That's right. Plus guess what?  The Patriot tests aren't why China's  showing its teeth. 
31285,sam, Why aren't they? 
31286,bartlet,Are you ready to come inside? 
31287,sam,"Yes, sir. "
31288,bartlet,"By the end of the week, Taiwan's going to announce they are holding their first free elections. "
31289,sam,You're kidding. 
31290,bartlet,Defend your queen. 
31291,leo,Our battle carrier groups are in international waters. Are you claiming jurisdiction? 
31292,leo,Then let's settle down. 
31293,leo,That's not on the table in this meeting. 
31294,leo,That's not on the table. 
31295,josh,How'd it go? 
31297,josh,Why? 
31299,josh,"It's been five years, and why is it our fault? "
31301,josh,It's called free trade. 
31303,josh, Didn't you... talk up our accomplishments? 
31305,josh,Donna. 
31307,josh,A commitment? 
31309,josh,"No! You- We're not making a trade commitment to the Flenders! We're not for protectionism,  and neither are the Republicans. Tell them the President's been good for the ecomony overall. "
31311,josh,We're for affordable health care. 
31313,josh,They don't - the Flenders don't work at the pulp mill! 
31315,josh,"All right. If Canada's making cheaper pulp, then New Hampshire has to diversify. That's why  the President has allocated five hundred million dollars for trade adjustment assistance.  That's why - write this down. That's why he's tripled small business start-up loans. That's  why he's balancing the budget.  Go. "
31317,josh,Go. 
31321,josh,"Hey, Charlie. "
31322,josh,No. 
31323,c.j.,Chaz. 
31324,c.j.,Did you lose it? 
31325,c.j.,Yet you don't have it. 
31326,c.j.,Thank you. 
31327,c.j.,How would I know? 
31328,c.j.,I just hope you didn't leave the building with it. 
31329,c.j.," Think you're going to want to talk nicer to me than that, because when a reporter  finds it, they're going to come to me, and that thing is stamped D12, and you signed out D12,  and rules are rules. "
31330,c.j.,What? 
31331,c.j.,How about that? 
31332,bartlet,Okay. 
31333,c.j.,Yeah? 
31334,leo,I want you to leak it to two or three sources; the U.S.S. Carl Vinson is going to do what's  called a passing exercise with the Independence. We want South China media to pick it up right away. 
31335,c.j.,Sure. 
31336,bartlet,Yeah? 
31337,bartlet,"Yeah.  Give us a minute, would you? "
31338,leo,I'll let you know when there's something new. 
31339,bartlet,Thanks. 
31340,toby,"Good evening Mr. President, welcome back. "
31341,bartlet,Thanks. C'mon in. 
31342,toby, I think this note was delivered to me by mistake. 
31343,bartlet,What's it say? 
31344,toby,'Come play chess.'
31345,bartlet,"No, that's for you. "
31346,toby,"It says 'Sigmund, come play chess'."
31347,bartlet,"That was a joke. Not so funny, huh? "
31348,toby,That's a beautiful chess set. 
31349,bartlet,"It's a gift, for you. "
31350,toby, Really? 
31351,bartlet,"Yeah. It's hand-carved, it belonged to the Prime Minister's grandfather. He used it to play  with Lord Mounbatten. "
31352,toby,I’m surprised she gave it away.
31353,bartlet,"Nah, she didn't, we just boosted it from the palace on our way out. I’ve got some little  bottles of shampoo and conditioner, too. "
31354,toby," Well, it's a beautiful gift, sir. "
31355,bartlet,Sit down. 
31356,toby,I wouldn't want to take your time tonight. 
31357,bartlet," Come on, now. You were out of line, I was a jackass - let's call a truce. "
31358,toby,"Well, I certainly apologise, sir. "
31359,bartlet, Let's play chess. 
31360,toby,Aren't you in the middle of a game with Sam? 
31361,bartlet,"Yeah; he's... one, two, four, eight, twelve moves away from checkmate. "
31362,toby,Twelve moves. 
31363,bartlet,Yeah. You take white. 
31364,toby, Lord Mountbatten used to play with this set? 
31365,bartlet,With Jawaharlal Nehru when they came to an agreement on the necessity of India's independence. 
31366,toby,Appropriate topic for the evening. 
31367,bartlet,Yeah. 
31368,bartlet,"Taiwan's not gonna be our topic. Ah, the Evans Gambit! "
31369,toby,There's no such thing as the Evans Gambit. 
31370,bartlet,"A variation of the Giuoco Piano opening, named after a British sea captain, W.D. Evans, who  invented it in 1820 - don't tell me chess moves. "
31371,toby,I moved my pawn. 
31372,bartlet,"Well, it's as popular today as it was back then. "
31373,toby,What is- 
31374,bartlet,I'm sorry? 
31375,toby,What is our topic? 
31376,bartlet,Re-election and the Bartlet Psychosis. 
31377,toby," Seems to me the last time we were here, we didn't do very well. "
31378,bartlet,So we get right back on the horse. 
31379,toby,"I was out of line sir, I really do apologize. "
31380,bartlet,"You apologized already, so let's get back on the horse. "
31381,toby,Neither one of us rides horses. 
31382,bartlet,That makes it more likely we'll learn something. 
31383,bartlet,Yeah? 
31384,bartlet,Excuse me; eleven moves. 
31385,bartlet,Take your time.  Think happy thoughts... 
31386,sam,Sir... 
31387,bartlet,Sure. 
31388,bartlet,The Spanish brought chess to the court of Charlemagne in 760 AD. Charlemagne is French for Charles  the Great. The Charles is a river in Boston. The Hudson River is actually not a river at all... 
31389,sam,I’m taking your rook.  
31390,bartlet,Now take your time.  See the whole board. 
31391,sam,The Hudson isn’t a river? 
31392,bartlet,"It is in the Catskills, but once it gets to Manhattan, it’s a tidal estuary. "
31393,sam,Because it’s deeper than the body of water it flows into. 
31394,bartlet,Yeah. 
31395,sam,You mind my asking how the meeting with the Chinese ambassador went? 
31396,bartlet,"Well, how do you think it went? "
31397,sam,"I think they said if Taiwan tests the Patriots, they’ll start their exercises. "
31398,bartlet,"That’s right, except they didn’t call them Patriots. What did they call them? "
31399,sam,US-made Patriots. 
31400,bartlet,Right. 
31401,sam,They want us to say we’re gonna roll back our sale of arms to Taiwan. 
31402,bartlet,Good. 
31403,sam,But we’re not going to stop arming Taiwan. 
31404,bartlet,No. 
31405,sam,Especially not now when they’re trying to hold free elections. 
31406,bartlet,Right. 
31407,sam,Plus it’s the law. 
31408,bartlet,Yeah. 
31409,sam,So we sell them the Orions and we sell them the AMRAAMs... 
31410,bartlet, Your move. 
31411,sam,Hang on... You’ve got two carrier groups headed to the Taiwan Strait... 
31412,bartlet,Move. 
31413,sam,"Plus, the Carl Vincent in the South China Sea...   Beijing wants you to scale back the weapons and you’re not going to do it... "
31414,bartlet,Right.  
31415,sam,How does it work? 
31416,bartlet,See the whole board! 
31417,sam,The Aegis Destroyers. 
31418,josh,"I’m going out for some pizza, do you want any? "
31419,c.j., I’ll go get it. I want to get some air. 
31420,josh,We need three. 
31421,c.j.,45 minutes till Hartsfield’s Landing! 
31422,josh,We’re working the room. 
31423,c.j.,Good. 
31424,josh,It is absurd that 42 people have this kind of power. 
31425,c.j.,I think it’s nice. 
31426,josh,Do you? 
31427,c.j., I think it’s democracy at its purest. They all gather at once... 
31428,josh,At a gas station. 
31429,c.j.,"It’s not a gas station, it’s nice.  There’s a registrar or voters, the names  are called in the alphabetical order, they put a folded piece of paper into a box. See, this  is the difference between you and me. "
31430,josh,You’re a sap? 
31431,c.j.,"Those 42 people are teaching us something about ourselves: that freedom is the glory of God,  that democracy is its birthright, and that our vote matters. "
31432,josh,You’re getting the pizza? 
31433,c.j.,"Yeah, I should call ahead. "
31434,c.j.,He crazy-glued my phone. 
31435,josh,Who? 
31436,c.j.,Ha ha. Charlie! Charlie crazy-glued my phone. Okay. Okay...  
31438,josh,How’d it go? 
31440,josh,And? 
31442,josh,Is this gonna end up with Mackey Flender as Fed chair? 
31444,josh,Tell them a national sales tax is regressive. Poor people pay a much higher percentage of  their income.  Tell them we’ll study it. 
31446,josh, No. 
31448,josh, There’s no salmon in New Hampshire! 
31450,josh,Tell them we haven’t made a decision on the salmon runs. Tell them salmon restoration is  important to the economy. 
31452,josh,What am I – the fish guy? Tell them we’re looking into it. 
31454,josh,He’s not going to... That’s the other guys! He’s not going privatize Social Security! He’ll...  He’ll privatize New Hampshire before he privatizes Social Security! 
31456,josh,‘Cause we told Congress we’d keep an open mind! 
31458,josh," Here. “Bartlet for New Hampshire.” Gives all the reasons why  Bartlet’s for the people of New Hampshire, the Flenders, everybody, all... 17 of them or...  whatever the hell goes on out there. Why are you wearing my coat? "
31460,josh,Okay. Go. 
31461,josh,Are we getting pizza? 
31462,leo, What are you doing? 
31463,josh,Trying to get a little pizza in an uncivilized world. 
31464,leo,"It’s not easy being you, is it? "
31465,josh,"No. Listen, so I shouldn’t sweat, right? There’s a predetermined time for the carrier groups? "
31466,leo,You know what? Half of me wants to let them go. 
31467,josh,Half of you always wants to let them go. Half of everybody always wants to let them go. 
31468,leo,"They need 400,000 troops on high alert for thinking about holding an election. 400,000 troops  and a battery of Patriot missiles for thinking about having an election. "
31469,josh,"You’re gonna turn the carrier groups around, right? "
31470,leo, We’ll see how the pizza turns out.
31472,josh," Yeah, it’s me. I just want to remind you that child support collection is up 37%. "
31474,josh,I said child support collection is up 37%. We’re cracking up on deadbeat dads. I wanted to  make sure you told them that. 
31476,josh,Leo was just here. 
31478,josh,"He’s talking about Tawian, he’s saying 400,000 troops and a battery of Patriot missiles just  to think about holding free elections. You know, it was one of those things... "
31480,josh,"Yeah, okay. "
31481,bartlet,"Let me tell you, you’re really showing me something tonight. A lot of spunk, a lot of pluck,  this game isn’t all about size, you know. There’s a little thing called heart, and you’ve  got it, my friend. "
31482,toby,"You know what, old man? The very minute they swear in the next guy, you and I are going round  and round. "
31483,bartlet,Check. 
31484,toby, How did you get good? 
31485,bartlet,"I had a friend in school who taught me. He was good. He was ranked 18 and under. He was a  really nice guy, everybody liked him. "
31486,toby,What was his name? 
31487,bartlet,David Wheaton. Everybody had a crush on his sister. 
31488,toby,You still see him? 
31489,bartlet,"He went on to Princeton and Christmas vacation, he’d saved up to go to San Francisco and he was  on the wharf and he saw a guy beating a woman up and he went in to stop it and the guy stabbed  him to death. "
31490,toby,"Well, he taught you well. "
31491,bartlet,"So you know, I had this historic stretch of sleeplessness after our last meeting? "
31492,toby,I didn’t know. 
31493,bartlet,Got so bad Leo brought in a guy from ATVA who worked with Josh. 
31494,toby,Isn’t he a trauma specialist? 
31495,bartlet,"Yeah, but we know him, and I figured he had to go to school for everything, so... Anyway, we  brought him in late at night. "
31496,toby,What did he say? 
31497,bartlet,He said it was your fault. He said you shouldn’t bother me so much. 
31498,toby,I really am sorry about that. 
31499,bartlet,I’m kidding. 
31500,toby,Yeah. I forgot for a second that you’re hilarious. 
31501,bartlet,Let’s go ahead and say the Republicans nominate Ritchie. 
31502,toby,They will. 
31503,bartlet,"First of all, I’d stop for a moment and say, you know, ‘why?’ I mean they got some serious guys  in the field. Kalmbach, Daniel, Wesley? "
31504,toby,"Democrats had a lot serious guys in the field, and they nominated you. "
31505,bartlet,That’s true. 
31506,toby, Check. 
31507,bartlet, You think the strike against me is nobody likes the smartest kid in the class. 
31508,toby,"I don’t know, sir. Being a smartest kid in the class is a pretty good pitch, it’s not a strike  unless you watch it as it sails by. "
31509,bartlet,I don’t do that. 
31510,toby,Check. 
31511,bartlet,And I’m not a snob. 
31512,toby,I don’t believe you are. 
31513,bartlet,"If a guy is a good neighbor, if he puts in a day, if every once in a while he laughs, if every  once in a while he thinks about somebody else and, above all else, if he can find his way to  compassion and, and tolerance, then he’s my brother, I don’t give a damn if he didn’t get past  finger-painting. What I can’t stomach are people who’re out to convince people that the educated  are soft and privileged and out to make them feel like they’re less, then, you know, ‘he may be  educated, but I’m plain-spoken, just like you!’ Especially when we know that education can be a  silver bullet, it can be the silver bullet, Toby! For crime, poverty, unemployment, drugs, hate... "
31514,toby,Who are you trying to convince? 
31515,bartlet,I’m saying I don’t watch the pitch go by. 
31516,toby,Check. 
31517,bartlet,"And if I do, it’s not because my father... "
31518,toby,Was an idiot. 
31519,bartlet," Can we talk... God, can we talk about, please, can we talk about my father with some respect?  The man’s gone, can we... he’s my father, he wasn’t a Dickens character! "
31520,toby,"Yes, sir. "
31521,leo, Mr. President? 
31522,bartlet,Yeah. 
31523,bartlet,Check. 
31524,bartlet,Check. 
31525,bartlet,Check. I’ll be back. 
31526,bartlet,Don’t cheat. I know exactly where the pieces on the board are. I know exactly where the pieces  are on Sam’s board. I know exactly where the pieces still are on David Wheaton’s.  
31527,bartlet,All right.  You can bring the ambassador back now and get Beijing. 
31528,leo,She needs the order. 
31529,bartlet,The Aegis Destroyers. 
31530,bartlet,"I don’t know, but for sure we’re gonna blame you. "
31531,leo,What’s going on? 
31532,bartlet,I don’t know. Toby keeps coming back at me with this... I don’t know. He says I let the pitch go by. 
31533,leo,What pitch? 
31534,bartlet,"I soften... I smooth myself out publicly. It’s not a put-on, by the way, I’m honestly folksy. "
31535,leo,Yeah. 
31536,bartlet,Yeah what? 
31537,leo,Yeah... nothing. 
31538,bartlet,You agree with him? 
31539,leo,I don’t think you let the pitch go by. 
31540,bartlet,I don’t. 
31541,leo,I think you foul it off. 
31542,bartlet,"Yeah, well, he keeps coming back at me. "
31543,leo,"Invited him back this time, didn’t you? "
31544,bartlet,All right.  
31545,leo,So? What are you doing? 
31546,bartlet,Just playing some chess.  
31547,c.j.,"Tommy, it’s me! "
31548,c.j.,It must be bent or something. 
31549,c.j.,"I’m staying right here, I haven’t moved! "
31550,c.j.,"Guys, it’s me! "
31551,c.j.,"Yes! Okay, well, obviously I’m not. "
31552,c.j.,Becau... 
31553,leo, What’s going on? 
31554,leo,"C.J., what the hell... "
31555,c.j.,Charlie’s getting me back for...
31556,c.j.,"Oh, my God. "
31557,leo,"Tommy, sign her in with an appointment. "
31558,c.j.,An appointment?! 
31559,leo,Be in your office in 15 minutes. 
31560,c.j.,Can I move now? 
31562,josh,Donna. 
31564,josh,Let them vote. 
31566,josh,I came out here to tell you to let them vote. 
31567,josh," Yeah, this is Josh Lyman. We just wanted to call and thank you again for all your  work and remind you that the polls in Hartsfield’s Landing open in fourteen minutes. Get the  chains in the truck, Mack? Okay, listen, tell your sister in Oregon I’m gonna try and learn  something about salmon. Right now, all I know is they’re good on a bagel. Good night. "
31568,josh," Maybe they are morally superior. Anyway, they get to vote. "
31569,josh,It’s freezing out here. Can I have my coat back? 
31570,toby,"Abbey told me this story once. She said you were at a party once where you were bending the  guy’s ear. You were telling him that Ellie had mastered her multiplication tables and she  was in third grade reading at a fifth-grade level and she loved books and she scored two  goals for her soccer team the week before, you were going on and on... And what made that  story remarkable was that the party you were at was in Stockholm and the man you were talking  you was King Gustav, who two hours earlier had given you the Nobel Prize in economics.   I mean, my god, you just won the Nobel Prize and all you wanted to talk about  to the King of Sweden was Ellie’s multiplication tables! "
31571,bartlet, What’s your point? 
31572,toby,"You’re a good father, you don’t have to act like it. You’re the President, you don’t have  to act like it. You’re a good man, you don’t have to act like it. You’re not just folks,  you’re not plain-spoken... Do not – do not – do not act like it! "
31573,bartlet,I don’t want to be killed. 
31574,toby,"Then make this election about smart, and not... Make it about engaged, and not. Qualified,  and not. Make it about a heavyweight. You’re a heavyweight. And you’ve been holding me up  for too many rounds. "
31575,bartlet,Pick your king up. We’re not done playing yet. 
31576,c.j.,Hello. 
31577,c.j.,You really want to dance with me? 
31578,c.j.,What are you doing in here? 
31579,c.j.,Leo? 
31580,leo,What the hell??!
31581,c.j.,I want a copy of the daily schedule and Maryann the librarian over here told me I had to sign it out... 
31582,c.j.,And he crazy-glued my phone!!! 
31583,leo,"All right. I think it’s fine that people blow off a little steam, but now it’s done, and it’s time  for one of you to be mature. "
31584,c.j.,Hey! 
31585,leo,Yeah. 
31586,c.j.,"Okay. Well. Okay, it’s over. That’s that. "
31587,c.j.,"So, how long do you usually make people your bitch? "
31588,c.j.,Okay... 
31589,bartlet,Sorry. I got tied up. 
31590,sam,"No, it’s fine. "
31591,bartlet,Let’s get back to it. 
31592,sam,"You know, sir, I looked something up while you were gone. Eisenhower, it seemed, at all costs  wanted to avoid sending ships to resupply Quemoy and Matsu, ‘cause they’d be less then a mile  from the Chinese army. A private could... well, everybody was a private in Mao’s army, but a  private could fire on a ship and that’d be it. We’d be at war. We’d have to be. "
31593,bartlet,Yeah. 
31594,sam,Eisenhower wouldn’t do it. 
31595,bartlet,No. 
31596,sam,Why are you? 
31597,bartlet,Look at the whole board. 
31598,sam,I am. 
31599,bartlet,You’re not. 
31600,sam,I’m trying! 
31601,bartlet,Sam... 
31602,sam,Why were the carrier groups in the Taiwan Strait? 
31603,bartlet,Are they in the Taiwan Strait? 
31604,sam,They’re on their way. 
31605,bartlet,Is that the same thing? 
31606,sam,How does this end? 
31607,leo,Sir. 
31608,bartlet, Like this. 
31609,bartlet,Turn them around. I’ll make some calls and thank people. 
31610,leo,"Yes, sir. "
31611,bartlet,"Thank you, by the way. "
31612,leo,"You, too.  "
31613,sam,I’d like to try it without looking at the note. 
31614,bartlet, Okay. 
31615,sam,China agrees to stand down the war games. 
31616,bartlet,Right. 
31617,sam,And they agree to let Taiwan test the Patriots. One Patriot. 
31618,bartlet,Yes. 
31619,sam,"And we... Please, I want to be right about this. We agree not to sell Taiwan the Aegis Destroyers  for a period of... I don’t know... five years. "
31620,bartlet,"Ten years, but you’ve got it. "
31621,sam,"Sir, the Aegis... the Aegis radar technology isn’t something that... I mean, what if Taiwan  did fall to China? Now they have – plus these ships cost something like $800 million apiece.  Buying four of them would eat half of Taiwan’s defense budget. "
31622,bartlet,And so... 
31623,sam,You never were going to sell them the destroyers. 
31624,bartlet, But everybody wakes up alive in the morning and saves a little face. 
31625,sam," I don’t know how you... I don’t know the word, I... don’t know how you do it. "
31626,bartlet,You have a lot of help. You listen to everybody and then you call the play.  That’s checkmate. 
31628,bartlet, I do.
31630,bartlet, Are they new?
31632,bartlet, You've worn them?
31634,bartlet," I love them. ""Laissez-faire doctrine."" 15 letters."
31636,bartlet,"No, that's not the answer. See, 'cause Social Darwinism isn't a doctrine. It's a  force of nature. The answer is ""libertarianism."" "
31638,bartlet,Take your time.
31640,bartlet,"Boo boo, I gave up on getting you out the door in the late 70's. Plus, it's your  birthday. You're old, and you don't move around that fast."
31642,bartlet,"I know, so I'm shading in the extra box. "
31644,bartlet,"It's your birthday week. It's a week of festivities like Mardi Gras or Lent. Three  letters. ""It may be bitter."" ""Tea,"" right?"
31646,bartlet,Yeah.
31648,bartlet,"'Cause ""woman"" doesn't fit."
31650,bartlet,"Hey, when the Medical Board gives you the results of the hearing, do they slap it up  on one of those X-ray light boards? ""Here's where the problem is with your testimony, Abbey. Here and here."""
31652,bartlet,"See, I know it sounds like you're praising me, but..."
31654,bartlet, It's not your life or 12 years of anything or anything. They're gonna give you  the very least they can give you.
31656,bartlet,"Well, that was stupid."
31658,bartlet,Standing by your convictions isn't gonna get you anywhere. This isn't some guy off the  street talking. I'm a very successful politician.
31660,bartlet,"About 200, but that was five or six hours ago when it started."
31662,bartlet,"""Body organ, produces hydrochloric acid."" That's the kidney, right? Or the lima bean?"
31664,bartlet,"See, they can't take medical school away from you."
31666,bartlet,"Abbey, come here."
31667,bartlet,"I know you're scared. I'm very confident. So you be whatever you want. Whatever happens  happens tomorrow. Tonight is your birthday party, and your earrings are great, so are  your shoes. So can we, for the love of God, get out of this room?!"
31669,bartlet,Yeah.
31670,bartlet,"Pheasant and morel consomme, miniature ravioli of fois gras and smoked goose confit, a  little Canary melon sorbet as a palate cleanser, all served on the finest Lenox china."
31672,bartlet,A '97 Willamette Valley Pinot Noir. A '94 Hog Cellars Zinfandel.
31674,bartlet,"I'm like Gatsby, but without the problems."
31676,bartlet,Hmm.
31678,bartlet,I kind of wished you'd mentioned that before.
31680,bartlet, It's gonna be relaxed. It's gonna be relaxed.
31681,bartlet," For dessert, we're having Kumquat Napoleons."
31683,bartlet,Okay.
31684,josh,"Happy birthday, Mrs. B."
31686,bartlet,Amy.
31688,josh,The jury's still out.
31690,bartlet,Donna was invited. All the women of the west wing. We're doing a calendar.
31691,josh,I'm not sure what's keeping her.
31692,bartlet,"Now, it's a party!"
31694,bartlet,All right.
31697,bartlet,"You know, John, there are places in the world where it might be considered rude to  talk about the physical attributes of another man's wife."
31699,bartlet,That was nice of her. 
31700,bartlet,What did I do?
31701,bartlet,"Look, obviously, we knew this was gonna be a thing, but it doesn't have to be tonight,  right?"
31703,bartlet,I'm pretty sure he means Leo.
31704,bartlet,No.
31706,bartlet, So! So far so good.
31707,c.j.,Leo?
31708,leo,"Yeah. Do me a favor, would you? Check out a rumor that a Robert Nolan, who's the chairman  of the New Hampshire State Medical Board is gonna recuse himself from Abbey's hearing."
31709,leo,Yeah.
31710,c.j.,And what's the source?
31711,leo,"I don't know the original source, but it's coming from the Manchester Union Leader,  and you got to change taxicabs a couple of times because I don't want the paper knowing  we're asking questions."
31712,c.j.,That's no problem. What's going on?
31713,leo,"Well, let's confirm the story first. If it's true, bring it to the President."
31714,c.j.,"Okay, and one of us... well, you... need to talk to Abbey tonight about tomorrow."
31715,leo,"Happy birthday, Abbey."
31716,c.j.,I'll get this other thing.
31717,c.j.,Hey.
31718,sam,Hey. Jack Enlow?
31719,c.j.,"No, it's C.J. Cregg. We've met."
31720,sam,And laughed and laughed. Is Jack Enlow at the party yet?
31721,c.j.,I'm not at the party yet.
31722,sam,Fair point.
31723,c.j.,"Look, if you're planning on starting a rumble with Enlow, can I send the press home?"
31724,sam,I'm not an instigator.
31725,c.j.,"Yes, you are."
31726,sam,"Yeah, but I'm on the side of the angels."
31727,c.j.,I can say this about you. You can wear a tuxedo.
31728,sam,I know.
31729,c.j.,I know you know.
31730,sam,Good evening.
31731,leo,Why is Dalton Millgate coming here?
31732,sam,How did you know he was coming here?
31733,leo,How do you think?
31734,sam,Because you know everything.
31735,leo,Yes.
31736,sam,"I had him for a semester at school. He and his people are having trouble getting  funding for a superconductor, and I told him I'd use this opportunity to put him  up with Jack Enlow."
31737,leo,You're gonna get into a fight with Jack Enlow?
31738,sam,Why does everybody think...? Never mind. I'm just doing him a favor.
31739,leo,Okay.
31740,sam,How you feeling about the First Lady?
31741,leo,"I was feeling good, and now I'm not."
31742,sam,Why?
31743,leo,"We're checking out, but I think the swing vote's gonna recuse himself. He's a friend  of the family."
31744,sam,That means the President's gonna want to call him.
31745,leo,Maybe.
31746,sam,"Yeah, he can't."
31747,leo,What?
31748,sam,He can't call him. It could send us into a whole new thing.
31749,leo,You ever mix politics and the President's family and get a good result?
31750,sam,No.
31751,leo,"Me neither, and I've been a this a lot longer."
31752,sam,"Okay. Seriously, he can't pick up the phone."
31753,leo,Isn't it called a Supercollider?
31754,sam,Is it?
31755,leo,You called it a Superconductor.
31756,sam,Whatever.
31757,leo,Keep blood off your shirt.
31758,sam,I'm not an instigator. 
31759,josh,Donna.
31761,josh,What are you doing here?
31763,josh,The party's started.
31765,josh,The men are in tuxes.
31767,josh,What are you doing here?
31769,josh,A problem with what?
31771,josh,"Donna, you work in the White House. You fly with the President. What's the problem?"
31773,josh,Come with me. Come to the party.
31775,josh,Why?
31777,josh,They didn't tell you what the problem was?
31779,josh,You want me to get into it?
31781,josh,Yeah. You look good.
31783,sam,Dr. Millgate?
31784,sam,It's been a long time.
31785,sam,"And now the student becomes the teacher, huh?"
31786,sam,Okay. So did I disappoint you when I didn't go into physics?
31787,sam,Why?
31788,sam,"No, I wasn't."
31789,sam,I just needed a little encouragement.
31790,sam,"Look, Congress isn't gonna fund your damn Superconductor, all right?"
31791,sam,Yes.
31792,sam,Okay.
31793,sam,"Well, there was a time..."
31794,sam,Congress spent two billion.
31795,sam,The senator?
31796,sam,Yeah.
31797,sam,He's there.
31798,sam,"Okay. I said I'd do this, but it's likely he's gonna say this is an unaffordable luxury."
31799,sam,That doesn't really sound like enough.
31800,sam,What hotel are you staying in?
31801,sam,Where can I call you?
31802,sam,"It's not like a drive-up window, Dr. Millgate."
31803,sam,Okay. 
31804,bartlet, Charlie!
31805,bartlet,I'm gonna need you later.
31806,bartlet,I want to work on my toast.
31807,bartlet,I don't need help writing it. I can write a damn toast. I just want to say it out  loud to somebody. Any warm body is fine.
31808,bartlet,"So when I give you the signal, we'll go off someplace."
31809,bartlet,"It'll be something like ""Charlie, we're gonna go work on the toast now."""
31810,leo, Excuse me.
31811,bartlet,You finally got here.
31812,leo,Yeah.
31813,bartlet,I think Abbey's gonna pull a hamstring about tomorrow.
31814,leo,You mind if I talk to her a little bit?
31815,bartlet,About what?
31816,leo,"You know, what she should be saying tomorrow."
31817,bartlet,I'm feeling all right about it.
31818,leo,"Well, just in case."
31819,bartlet, I don't know. She's pretty pissed.
31820,leo,"Yeah, but at you, right?"
31821,bartlet,Yeah.
31822,leo,Yeah. So?
31823,bartlet,All right.
31824,leo,Did she like the fanfare?
31825,bartlet,Loved it.
31826,leo,Okay.
31827,josh,Chuck!
31828,josh,I didn't know you were friends with the First Lady.
31829,josh,"Oh, sure, yeah. You know Amy Gardner?"
31830,josh,"Actually, you meant Sam."
31831,josh,"No, but as long as you heard I was great."
31832,josh,Yeah.
31833,josh,"Good seeing you, Chuck."
31834,josh,No.
31835,josh,"No, Mugsy. Chuck Kane heads Intergovernmental Affairs at Treasury, and he wants a job  on the campaign as Deputy Political Director."
31836,josh,I don't think so.
31837,josh,Mark Rothman and Robbie Gill.
31838,josh,What?
31839,josh,They're men.
31840,josh,They happen to be men.  They happen to be men.
31841,josh,How do you know?
31842,josh,We're in a dangerous area right now.
31843,josh,Let me tell you why this is a dangerous area. Because I can't make decisions based on  the fact that I like your smooth skin.
31844,josh,Don't try and trick me.
31845,josh,Yes.
31846,josh,You're trying to trick me.
31847,josh,I'm gonna be scared for the rest of the night.
31848,josh,Donna. Yes. Excuse me.
31849,leo,Josh.
31850,josh,Yeah.
31851,leo,Where's the President?
31852,josh,He went off with Charlie to work on his toast.
31853,leo,All right. I'm gonna need a few minutes of uninterrupted time...
31854,leo, Yeah.
31855,josh,I got to go. 
31856,leo,Yeah.
31857,leo,"How are you, John?"
31858,leo,Hang on.  Toby!
31859,leo, You know Toby Ziegler?
31860,leo,"Toby, come here.  Lord John Marbury."
31861,toby," Good evening, Your, uh, Lordship."
31862,toby,You have objections to him coming to the White House?
31863,toby,Which are?
31864,toby,"Well, let's hang on a second. Sinn Fein is a political party. In fact, the oldest in  Ireland."
31865,toby,Sir...
31866,toby,I wouldn't...
31867,toby,"Yes, sir."
31868,toby,He's not being honored. He's just been given an invitation.
31869,toby,"And I think we have to be careful how we use the word ""terrorist.""  Can I call  you John?"
31870,toby, You feel like a drink?
31871,toby,I know Lagavulin.
31872,toby,Let's go down the street. The guy keeps a bottle there.
31873,sam,"Excuse me, Senator."
31874,sam,Sam Seaborn.
31875,sam,I was wondering if you had a moment.
31876,sam,"This will just take a moment. Believe it or not, I have an eminent physicist in my  office. Dr. Millgate. You heard of him?"
31877,sam,"He was asking me about the Supercollider, and I didn't have any answers, and..."
31878,sam,It is?
31879,sam,"Well, I'm sure there's some poets alive in Greece someplace. Can you tell me how it died?"
31880,sam,"Forgive me, sir. You're ranking member of the authorizing subcommittee. How can you not  know?"
31881,sam,That only applies to nominations.
31882,sam,Senator...
31883,sam,I don't understand. You file an objection. How long does it last?
31884,sam,That's insane.
31885,sam,"Senator, this isn't a duck hunter with a gripe in my office. It's Dalton Millgate.  Now who's blocking the damn Supercollider."
31886,sam,To tell me would compromise the spirit of autocratic obstructionism.
31887,sam,"And the drain that swallows it, sir."
31888,sam,Thank God the hold's anonymous.  It's you.
31889,sam,"I didn't before. It's a long night, and we're not done yet. Go dance with your wife."
31890,josh,Hi.
31892,josh,I brought you some food.
31894,josh,"Well, I-I don't have all the answers, but it's pretty weird, so far."
31896,josh,Secret Service says there's an INS notation next to your name.
31898,josh,U.S. Citizen: N.
31900,josh,"No, it... Yes."
31902,josh,T-They're saying...
31904,josh,A mistake of some kind.
31906,josh,We're sorting it out.
31908,josh,It'll just take a few more minutes.
31910,josh,Olives. 
31912,josh,All right.
31914,josh,Okay.
31916,leo,"Yeah. The thing is though, the first day's important. What I like to do, for instance,  is schedule a public event, show we're not scared. "
31918,leo,"You'll make a comment, but body language is gonna be just as important. Can't hang  your head. You got to smile, but you look smug..."
31920,leo,You got to...
31922,leo,"And there can't be... Obviously, there can't be no reaction."
31924,leo, I'm not gonna tell a man's wife she can't campaign.
31926,leo,"I think we can get a lot of use out of you in targeted Democratic areas. Big cities,  evening fundraisers. We'll keep you out of the South."
31928,leo,We just need to...
31930,leo,It's important.
31932,leo,Of course.
31933,leo,I'm sorry. Enjoy the party.
31935,bartlet,"""I've known my wife, Abbey, for nearly 150 years."" No, I'm not gonna do that. She's  not gonna think that's funny."
31936,bartlet,"Okay. I should... Yeah. Okay. ""Thank you all for being here tonight."" By the way, do  you know where the term ""toast"" comes from?"
31937,bartlet,Yeah.
31938,bartlet,I was talking to you.
31939,bartlet,The Stuarts. They put a piece of toast in your wine cup to improve the flavor.
31940,bartlet,1643. Members of the Middle Temple toasted Princess Elizabeth by pledging to die in  her service.
31941,c.j.," Excuse me, Mr. President."
31942,bartlet,"C.J., I haven't seen you all night."
31943,c.j.,"I haven't been able to make it out there yet, sir. I've been tracking something down."
31944,bartlet,Charlie.
31945,bartlet, What is it?
31946,c.j.,"A piece on the Manchester Union-Leader.  ""Sources close to Robert  Nolan, president of the New Hampshire Medical Board, predict that he will announce  his recusal from the case because of his personal..."""
31947,bartlet,No. Damn it.
31948,c.j.,"""...relationship with the Bartlets."" What does this mean for her?"
31949,bartlet,"We're pretty sure the Board was evenly divided, and Nolan was the deciding vote, which  dictated a lot of her... Damn it!"
31950,c.j.,There was a personal relationship.
31951,bartlet,"Yeah, they worked together for 20 years, and I was the governor who appointed him to  the Board."
31952,leo," Excuse me, sir."
31953,bartlet,"C.J., you should probably tell Abbey."
31954,c.j.,"Yes, sir."
31955,bartlet,Thanks.
31956,c.j.,"Thank you, Mr. President. "
31957,bartlet,The Union-Leader says Nolan's gonna recuse himself.
31958,leo,What's gonna happen?
31959,bartlet,They're gonna suspend her license for a year.
31960,leo,We just talked for a little bit.
31961,bartlet,And?
31962,leo,I don't think you need to be concerned about her leaving you for me.
31963,bartlet,I was pretty concerned about that.
31964,leo,"She's definitely leaving you for somebody, so don't be so..."
31965,bartlet,"Can you leave me alone? I'm trying to be a husband, and your mojo's getting all over me."
31966,leo, Marbury's sitting with Toby.
31967,bartlet,"This is Brendan McGann, right?"
31968,leo,Yeah.
31969,bartlet,Yeah. I don't know what to say about that.
31970,leo, I'll see you inside.
31971,bartlet,Yeah.
31972,leo,"Thank you, Mr. President."
31974,josh,"Good evening, ma'am."
31976,josh,Uh... we got it down to a few finals.
31978,josh,I can't help noticing these are all women.
31980,josh,I'm sorry?
31981,c.j., Mrs. Bartlet?
31983,josh,Yeah.
31985,josh,"Yes, ma'am."
31987,josh,You bet. 
31989,c.j.,"Thank you, ma'am, and so do you."
31990,c.j.,I need to speak with you for a second.
31992,c.j.,"No, I'm afraid not. Abbey, the Union-Leader's got sources saying Dr. Nolan's gonna  recuse himself from the case."
31994,c.j.,"Yes, ma'am?"
31996,c.j.," Oh, okay."
31997,josh," Yes, it is."
31998,josh,"Yes, she did."
31999,josh,"You went over my head, and you did it behind my back."
32000,josh,What kind of position is Abbey Bartlet in to know anything...?
32003,josh,You're going?
32004,josh,Amy... 
32005,sam,All right. Listen.
32006,sam,"Well, first of all, you're not allowed to smoke in the White House."
32007,sam,No.
32008,sam,Come outside.
32009,sam,I need you to tell me everything you can tell me about the Superconducting Supercollider.
32010,sam,About ten minutes.
32011,sam,Listen. This is what I do. I get things fast.
32012,sam,What is it?
32013,sam,You know what? I had four years. There's a lot of knowledge out there. I may have  missed some... things.
32014,sam,"Okay, terrific. I understand that. What kind of practical applications does it have?"
32015,sam,You're not in any way a helpful person.
32016,sam,Doctor.
32017,sam,"I need to be able to show him I can paint him against something. Children, baseball,  campaign finance. What does it mean to be against the Supercollider?"
32018,sam,Come on.
32019,sam,What are you talking about? You called me and asked me...
32020,sam, I have a history with this particular senator.
32021,sam,I like to win.
32022,sam,What do you care?
32023,sam,What's your motivation?
32024,sam,Not suddenly. Why now?
32025,toby,I think there's something to be said for giving McGann credibility by inviting him to  the White House. It strengthens his hand in-in dealing with the more violent members  of the party.
32026,toby,"We also think if we legitimize him, the Protestants will wake up and accept they've  got to negotiate with somebody."
32027,toby,There were many authors.
32028,toby,True.
32029,toby,"We've had Arafat here, John."
32030,toby,It wasn't worth trying?
32031,toby,The President's not a kid.
32032,toby,"And wasn't it James Joyce who said, ""History is a nightmare from which I'm trying to  awake."""
32033,toby,You're saying we should butt out of Ireland until we know what we're doing?
32034,toby," Say, speaking of dead Irish writers..."
32036,c.j.,I'm gonna open the wine.
32040,c.j.,This is an excellent corkscrew. Just slides right in there like power steering. The right  tool for the job.  This corkscrew sucks. Should  I call the steward?
32050,c.j.,What?
32052,c.j.,You're not an American?
32063,c.j.,I wouldn't worry about it.
32066,c.j., Ah!
32068,c.j.,Next best thing. It's in the bottle.
32070,c.j.,Yeah.
32071,c.j.,This is a good bottle of wine.  I don't understand. It was good  corkscrew. Graphite...
32072,c.j.,Stop talking about the corkscrew?
32077,c.j.,Your husband got eaten?
32079,c.j.,"Yeah. Well, I'm on dangling modifier patrol."
32081,c.j.,Are you First Lady right now?
32083,c.j.,"Sometimes you like to talk, and I think that's great, but sometimes you're Abbey, and  sometimes you're my boss, and I respect both very much, but..."
32085,c.j.,"Yes. I agree with her.  Look, they take this job away from me, I got  nothing. I don't have a cat. I could get one, but I don't have one. Frankly, I'm not  wild about cats. I don't hate them. I'm just not... I could learn to like them, I guess,  if I..."
32086,c.j.,"You've got a husband, children, a home and a life. And we're talking about one year of  your not having a medical license."
32088,c.j.,That's different.
32090,c.j.,"Because it is, and you know it."
32092,c.j.,Okay.
32095,c.j.,There's plenty of stuff left.
32104,bartlet,Okay. Here we go.
32105,bartlet,That's when the juices get flowing.
32106,bartlet,I could tell the story of the ditch digger.
32107,bartlet,You know the story?
32108,bartlet,"Abbey and I were walking along and we see a ditch digger, and I said, ""Aren't you glad  you married me? You could've married a ditch digger."" And she said, ""Jed, if I'd married  him, he'd be President."" What do you think?"
32109,bartlet,Why?
32110,bartlet,It is.
32111,bartlet,Very deeply.
32112,bartlet,"No, it won't."
32113,bartlet,"In my house, anyone who uses one word when they could have used ten just isn't trying  hard. Let's keep at it."
32114,toby,Native Americans.
32115,toby,"Well, they've given u s a couple of U.S. Presidents, a lot of Boston Democrats, and half  of the New York City's Police Force."
32116,toby,Yeah.
32117,toby,So wouldn't you say we were doing you a favor?
32118,toby,That is the act of a friend. What is left to do but talk? What could be better for that  wounded place than sitting down and talking? What is better than sitting down and talking?
32119,toby,We can't choose who.
32120,toby,Then what can we do but talk to him?
32121,toby,What?
32122,toby,Brendan McGann cannot come to the White House.
32123,toby," Understood, Mr. Ambassador."
32124,sam,Yeah.
32125,sam,Yeah.
32126,sam,"Listen, is there no doctor you can see..."
32127,sam,You got my note.
32128,sam, Let's play our game.
32129,sam,Don't make me laugh.
32130,sam,"I couldn't figure out what this on the record/off the record crap was until Dr. Millgate,  this is Dr. Millgate, by the way. "
32131,sam,"Until Dr. Millgate told me the thing is gonna be built in Illinois. So, of course, you  have to be for it on the record, but off the record, it crowds out all the pork you've  got your eye on, like the Senator Enlow Off-Ramp, Rest Stop, Hotel and Casino."
32132,sam,Senator!
32133,sam,I apologize. I apologize for my tactics and my behavior.
32134,sam,"Okay. Please don't let that jeopardize, you know... The subcommittee should have hearings  on this. There should be learned testimony."
32135,sam,"It won't. ""We've discovered a seamless, intellectual framework for the universe"" isn't  a good 30-second spot."
32136,sam,Discovery.
32137,sam,That's the thing that you were... Discovery is what. That's what this is used for.  It's for discovery.
32138,sam,Just as long as democracy's not dead in the Senate.
32139,sam,'Cause you're scared of my threat?
32140,sam,Good.
32141,sam,Thank you.
32142,sam,I've got to get back to the party.
32143,sam,"Oh, we can get you a room for the night."
32144,sam,"God, Dalton, isn't there anything? Sloane-Kettering, or...?"
32145,sam,All right.
32146,sam,Now you think I'd make a good physicist?
32152,josh,Excuse me.
32154,josh,"Donna... Actually...  First of all, Amy..."
32155,josh," I understand, and I forgive you."
32156,josh,I do.
32158,josh,No problem.
32159,josh,"Donna, you're an American again. INS has a grandfather clause. If you pass a three-part  literacy test, an American history exam, and fill out a one-page form, you're back."
32162,josh,Why?
32165,bartlet, What the hell is going on?!
32167,bartlet,I was gone for 45 minutes. They were all Americans when I left.
32169,bartlet,"I called Nolan. I know I shouldn't have, but I'm sorry. The rules are different when it  comes to my family. There isn't a man in America who doesn't understand that. I also  think partiality isn't a vice in this case. He knows you, and that's a good thing. He's  gonna consider not recusing himself."
32171,bartlet,"Okay. I'm gonna do a toast and everything in a minute, and I'll tell the ditch story,  but I wanted to say that I love you very much."
32173,bartlet,Don't call me that.
32176,bartlet,I'm standing right here!
32178,leo,Abbey.
32179,leo,"I haven't had a chance to say happy birthday. Happy birthday, Abbey."
32180,bartlet,Good to be talking to you.
32181,bartlet,The Mural Room as a matter of fact.
32182,bartlet,"That's right, and Thursday night we're going to talk about energy dependence versus  independence and cleaner burning fuels that get up to 80 miles per gallon versus  oil-based fuels that pump billions of pounds of pollution into our air and perhaps  just as important our vulnerable to very volatile price spikes. We want to talk about  controlling our destiny through innovation instead of relying so heavily on foreign oil."
32183,bartlet,"Yeah. 65% of the world's oil reserves are in the Mid East. 3% are here at home. I,  for one, wouldn't mind sending a little less of my money over there and the only  alternative is to use less oil."
32184,bartlet,"I hope so, but there'll be plenty of time for campaigning come the fall. Thursday night  is about America's energy future."
32185,bartlet,"Thank you, Kim."
32186,bartlet,"I'm-- Terry, I'm sorry."
32187,bartlet,That was my ninth interview this morning.
32188,bartlet,"Well, I guess we'll be ready to run against whoever we have to run against."
32189,bartlet,Rob Ritchie? I don't know him very well.
32190,bartlet,Thank you.
32191,toby,They all want to talk about Ritchie's book.
32192,bartlet,We can talk about my book.
32193,toby,Theory and Design of Macro Economics in Developing Nations?
32194,bartlet,Yeah.
32195,bartlet,Thanks.
32196,toby,"When they say ""exploring"" you got to say ""drilling."" There's a 12 point kick with  ANWAR between ""exploring"" and drilling."""
32197,bartlet,What else?
32198,toby,"Saudi Arabia, bad."
32199,bartlet,Got it.
32200,c.j.,How's it going?
32201,toby,Good.
32202,c.j.,Do you have a minute?
32203,toby,"Well, that's all I've got."
32204,c.j.,Could you do me a favor? I just got faxed a letter from Tabitha Fortis. She says she's  not comfortable going ahead with the dinner next week unless she gets to chastise the  administration for backing off it's commitment to banning land mines. I'm sure its just  a matter of hand-holding. Would you ask Sam to talk to her?
32205,toby,I'll do it.
32206,c.j.,I thought Sam 'cause he's more familiar with land mines.
32207,toby,I'll talk to her.
32208,c.j.,Why?
32209,toby,'Cause. 
32210,toby,What?
32211,c.j.,Is it possible you've got a little touch of the poet? Or would like a little touch of the poet?
32212,toby,Yes.
32213,c.j.,"Okay, then learn something about land mines, would you? We don't want to cancel. About  300 of the finest minds in the country are coming, plus some Congressmen."
32214,toby,It'll be fine.
32215,c.j.,"Knock 'em dead, de Bergerac."
32216,toby,Okay.
32217,bartlet,Okay what?
32218,toby,"Nothing, I just meant, you know, okay."
32219,bartlet,Drilling/exploring.
32220,toby,"Yes, sir."
32221,bartlet,Saudi Arabia bad.
32222,toby,Saudi Arabia very bad.
32223,bartlet,Okay.
32224,toby,Okay.
32225,bartlet,Why are you smiling?
32226,toby,Happiness is my default position.
32227,bartlet,Okay.
32228,bartlet,Good morning. Thanks for having me.
32229,bartlet,"And to shill for my new energy plan, which is about raising fuel economy standards, working  with Detroit to develop hybrid cars, and using tax incentives to promote alternative energy."
32230,bartlet,"After a decade of wars with Iraq and a spread of religious extremism in Saudi Arabia, we  still rely on this very dangerous, very uncertain region for a quarter of our oil reserves.  And I, for one, wouldn't mind not sending quite so much of my money there."
32231,bartlet,Exploring is what Magellan did and Balboa and Jacques Cousteau. What we're talking about  is drilling which is the only way you know if there's oil there and which will forever  damage national treasures like ANWAR.
32232,bartlet,Clean Coal is a term that pollsters came up with 'cause it polls higher then regular coal.  What we want are real cleaner burning fuels. We want to control our destiny through  innovation and that's what we're going to be talking about Thursday night.
32233,bartlet,My pleasure.
32234,bartlet,"Leslie, right?"
32235,bartlet,Thanks a lot.
32236,bartlet,There'll be plenty of bait in September-October.
32237,bartlet,I'll read it when he does.
32238,bartlet,"I don't know, Leslie. I think we might be talking about a .22 caliber mind in a .357 magnum world."
32239,bartlet,"Okay, thanks again.  Who's next?"
32240,toby,You were hot.
32241,bartlet,What?
32242,toby,When you said that just now. You were hot. They've got it on b-roll.
32243,josh,How'd the tape get out already?
32244,sam,We were just talking about that.
32245,c.j.,There was a local AP reporter at the station in Philly.
32246,josh,They didn't want to keep it for an exclusive?
32247,c.j.,It's better for them to have their call letters splashed on every... and the networks  will carry it tonight.
32248,josh,"This is amateur crap, Sam. How'd it happen?"
32249,sam,"Well, first of all, I wasn't there."
32250,josh,Who was there?
32251,sam,"My boss. The White House Director of Communications. It wasn't his fault, either. It was  eight seconds. It was his tenth interview. He didn't see that the green light was..."
32252,josh,"All right, you're right. What's first?"
32253,c.j.,I have the briefing room in 20 minutes.
32254,josh,What do you think you're going to get?
32255,c.j.,Is the President saying Governor Ritchie's stupid?
32256,sam,Yes.
32257,c.j.,No.
32258,sam,"Yes, is the only answer to that question."
32259,josh,"Why not, the President has the highest regard for Governor Ritchie. Believes he's a broad  thinker and a dedicated public servant?"
32260,sam,"Because it's the Press Briefing Room, not the Improv. There's no way for her to walk this  back. She'll sound disingenuous at best. Naive at worst."
32261,josh,I'm more concerned with how the President sounds.
32262,c.j.,I've got 80 boys and girls in there who don't make the distinction. And if I pretend Bobby  Ritchie's a nuclear physicist...
32263,sam,Then don't answer it. We're focusing on energy and dependence this week.
32264,c.j.,"No, we're focusing on this this week. I can try a non-apology apology."
32265,josh,Try it.
32266,c.j.,"""The President didn't realize that the camera was hot and he said something he shouldn't  have, as we all do from time to time."""
32267,josh,Nice.
32268,sam,Yeah. It's a head-fake towards contrition.
32269,josh,And we hold our heads high. All right.
32270,sam,Good. We'll see how it goes. (exits)
32271,josh,Why do you suppose this one's so hard to spin?
32272,c.j.,'Cause it's the classic Washington scandal. We screwed up by telling the truth.
32273,josh,All right. Lets try not to do that that much.
32274,josh,What's going on?
32275,josh,I'm sorry?
32276,josh,What is it?
32277,josh,What is it?
32279,josh,What are you talking about?
32281,josh,You're kidding me.
32283,josh,LemonLyman.com?
32285,josh,What do they talk about?
32288,josh,LemonLyman.com.
32290,josh,"All right, can everybody who doesn't work here, please go work where they work."
32291,josh,You can get this at your own desk.
32294,josh,Let me look at this thing.
32296,josh,Right. Yes. Let me know when C.J.'s briefing starts.
32297,bartlet,Sorry I'm late.
32298,leo,"Good morning, Mr. President."
32299,bartlet,We hearing from the Michigan delegation?
32300,leo,"We will. They'll want assurances no mandates, no timetable, make the whole thing voluntary  and industry-led."
32301,bartlet,Polluters aren't going to write the environmental laws. What about the Energy's Workers Union?
32302,leo,They just want to know it's Saudi jobs we're after.
32303,bartlet,It is.
32304,leo,"Look, the money's in raising the CAFE standards to 40 miles per gallon. That's the meeting  that's coming to my door."
32305,bartlet,What else?
32306,leo,You're going to be reprimanded tomorrow night on the house floor.
32307,bartlet,For what?
32308,leo,It's not nice to call people dumb.
32309,bartlet,"Let me ask you something. You're pretty dumb, did you take offense? Look at that. I did it again."
32310,bartlet,Yeah?
32311,leo,"Seriously, the GOP's lining up a bunch of people for order speeches."
32312,bartlet,Calling me impolite?
32313,leo,I guess.
32314,leo,"Anyway, the Whip's got about a 150 Democrats ready to rebut. You have any special preferences?"
32315,bartlet,I don't know. I guess the biggest names.
32316,leo,Know what we'd do if we were smart? We wouldn't send anybody. We'd look so good by not  showing up. Let them whine by themselves.
32317,c.j.,Good morning.
32318,c.j.,"The President didn't realize the camera was hot, and he said something he shouldn't have.  Something we all do from time to time."
32319,leo,Nice.
32320,c.j.,"Yeah, again, he said something he shouldn't have and he wouldn't have if he knew it was  going to be for public consumption."
32321,c.j.,"There's a reason they call it private, Stuart."
32322,bartlet,"All right, I'm going back to work."
32323,leo,All right.
32324,c.j.,The voters get to make those kinds of judgments.
32325,c.j.,Yes?
32326,c.j.,Yes.
32327,c.j.,"As I said yesterday, the President didn't realize the camera was hot and he said  something he shouldn't have. Katie?"
32328,c.j.,"Well, for one thing, while the Governor is the presumptive Republican nominee, it's  presumptive. For that matter, so is the President's renomination. But more important  than that, the President has been a candidate in seven statewide and national elections  and every one of them has been a substantive, issued-based campaign, which is one of  several reasons why the voters have elected him each and every time his name has  appeared on a ballot. Phil?"
32329,c.j.,You mean since yesterday?
32330,c.j.,No I wasn't.
32331,c.j.,"I've never asked him, but my guess is the President feels that a person's college  transcripts is a reasonable barometer of how a person did in college.   For the record, the President graduated Summa Cum Laude from the University of  Notre Dame with a major in American Studies and a minor in theology. He received a  Masters and a Doctorate at the London School of Economics and an honorary Doctorate  in Humane Letters from Dartmouth University where he was a tenured professor."
32332,sam,"All right, so far not bad."
32333,c.j.,What's next?
32334,sam,"Well, But Wachtell's in my office right now."
32335,c.j.,Of course he is. Don't give him what he wants.
32336,sam,I'm told I seldom give anybody what they want.
32337,c.j.,"We cant hold a bipartisan summit on bipartisanism, we'll look ridiculous."
32338,sam,"We're used to that, aren't we?"
32339,c.j.,Sam...
32340,sam,I'm not giving him what he wants.
32341,c.j.,"Is it me, or is Ritchie's people handling this wrong?"
32342,sam,It's not you.
32343,c.j.,Why keep it alive? There's no way for them to look good. The President was mean  to mean? Let it go. 
32344,sam,"By the way, my Princeton Tigers could whip your Cal Bears any day of the week."
32345,c.j.,At what?
32346,sam,"Logarithms, possibly."
32347,sam,Thank you.
32348,sam,Congressman.
32349,sam,"Actually, you know, they just sprayed for bugs."
32350,sam,"Well, first of all, it wasn't Toby's fault, it was mine. And it happened quickly and  we regret it."
32351,sam,"Our base is very happy, but when our base is happy, there's usually trouble someplace else."
32352,sam,"Nobody's bolting the party, it was an honest mistake. And, by the way, had nothing to do  with partisanism."
32353,sam,There's very little that can be done from the Communications Office.
32354,sam,Congressman...
32355,sam,I can bring it up but it'll get laughed out of the room.
32356,sam,It's an election year. We want to be partisan. We're trying to beat them.
32357,sam,We've got Ainsley Hayes.
32358,sam,"She was Associate White House Counsel, got promoted to Deputy Counsel, and she's just  slightly to the right of the Kaiser."
32359,sam,"Yes, sir, that's a good idea."
32360,sam,"Yes, sir."
32361,sam,Ginger... I need to see Ainsley.
32362,sam,When's she coming back?
32363,sam,"Mmm... Not so much, no."
32364,josh,Donna!
32366,josh,Sit down we’re gonna post a response on the site.
32368,josh,LemonLyman...
32370,josh,"Yeah, we got to post a response to someone."
32372,josh,Why?
32374,josh,Neither do you.
32376,josh,What's wrong with them?
32378,josh,These are people taking a very healthy interest in government. They should be applauded.
32380,josh,These are the people talking. I'm not an elitist.
32382,josh,"I am an elitist, but I have respect for people who don't measure up."
32384,josh,We've got to correct something.
32386,josh,"Irmatrude writes, ""Three nights ago on Nightline Josh said, 'We'll be asking for a GAO  study of Medicare drug pricing.' Apparently, no one's told Josh that only Congress can  ask the GAO to do anything."" First of all, how cool is that, that they know what the  GAO can and can't do?"
32388,josh,Sit down.
32390,josh,"Sit down. Irmatrude... Thanks for watching me on Nightline. Yes, I do know that only  Congress can instruct the GAO. When I said, ""We'll be asking,"" I meant Democrats and  not the White House. Thank you for your concern, Josh ""Lemon"" Lyman."
32392,josh,It's playful.
32394,josh,"You could get more in the spirit of this, you know."
32396,josh,Yes.
32398,toby,Excuse me.
32399,josh,Hey! You're done.
32400,toby,Is this tie all right?
32401,josh,I'm sorry?
32402,toby,"This necktie, does it go with the jacket?"
32403,josh,"God, I don't know Toby. The tie, is it red or is it green?"
32404,toby,"Congratulations, you're the hundredth person to make that joke."
32405,josh,"The tie is fine, why?"
32406,toby,I'm meeting someone.
32407,josh,When?
32408,toby,Now. Excuse me. 
32409,toby,Ms. Fortis?
32410,toby,I'm Toby Ziegler.
32411,toby,Yeah?
32412,toby,That's why no one writes poetry about me.
32413,toby,"Yeah, but he hasn't yet."
32414,toby,Do you want to be?
32415,toby,Then you're not.
32416,toby,"I think if you ask around, you'll discover that's unlikely. Do you want to come back  to my office?"
32417,toby,The President's open-mike gaffe.
32418,sam,Toby...?
32419,toby,"Sam, say hello to the newly-minted United States Poet Laureate, Tabitha Fortis."
32420,sam,"Yes, indeed. Poetry, I must tell you..."
32421,toby,That's fine.
32422,sam,"You, too. "
32423,toby,We can't get enough of it.
32424,toby,You.
32425,toby,Come on in.
32426,toby,"Exactly 63 feet from the Oval Office. If you don't think we measure, you're out of  your mind. Okay. So. Hello."
32427,toby,We have a problem?
32428,toby,"We have arranged a dinner in your honor. We've invited 300 important people, we've invited  the press, we've shined our shoes..."
32429,toby,Whoa... What happened to the nuance of diplomacy?
32430,toby,"No we-we're there now, you-you can't go back."
32431,toby,Right.
32432,toby,Yes.
32433,toby,You know who initiated it? Us. And the nations of the world rallied around it in yet  another impressive display of American leadership.
32434,toby,We bolted.
32435,toby,"And the reason we did is because we love anti-personnel land mines. We love 'em. And we  think the government should be in the business of selling them, like the Post Office.  In fact, the Post Office is the sales venue we've been considering."
32436,toby,"It's Korea. Tabitha. There are 900,000 North Korean soldiers in the DMZ, and the only  thing stopping them from walking into South Korea are 37,000 US troops, and about a  million land mines along the border. We have said over and over that we would be thrilled  to sign this treaty if we could have an exemption for South Korea and we have been rebuffed.  Rebuffed... I say."
32437,toby,Not a big deal at all.
32438,toby,If you voice your disagreement at a party in your honor hosted by the President with the  press in attendance then it's a gigantic deal which travels the 63 feet right to this office.
32439,c.j.,"Oh, my God, day three!"
32440,c.j.,"Well, I think this one may be unspinnable. That's certainly saying something coming from  my office. Yeah, he was calling him stupid."
32441,c.j.,He hasn't been able to feed or bathe himself.
32442,c.j.,"Mark, I swear to God, as soon as the President needs help understanding the hearts and  minds of the American people, he'll call the Republican Governor of Florida. But this  week, we're focused on tomorrow night's press conference wherein we unveil our national  strategy for energy independence. Speaking of which, this country has been dependent on  foreign oil for far too long. 65% of our crude oil reserves comes from the Gulf. Only  three percent here at home."
32443,c.j.,"Yeah, well, we all tried to convince the President that talking about policy was just  plain unsportmanlike, but we didn't get anywhere. Listen, I've had a lot of fun, and I  know you have, too. I'll see you later."
32444,c.j.,Chuckles.
32445,c.j.,Sure.
32446,c.j.,Yeah.
32447,c.j.,Huh?
32448,c.j.,"It will do huge and lasting damage to the environment, and it would not, in the long run,  reap that much oil."
32449,c.j.,"""Explore?"""
32450,c.j.,You mean drill?
32451,c.j.,You've been reading his book?
32452,c.j.,"""A Promise to Lead"", Ritchie's book."
32453,c.j.,"Carol, would you put together a page on the environmental impact of drilling the Artic  National Wildlife Reserve?"
32454,c.j.,Thank you.
32455,sam,Come in. 
32456,sam,"Hey, welcome back."
32457,sam,How was the vacation?
32458,sam,Where'd you go?
32459,sam,What'd you do?
32460,sam,"By the way, congratulations. Babish is promoting you to deputy."
32461,sam,Right after I told Bill Wachtell that we already had.
32462,sam,"Well, Monday morning, there was a little incident during the satellite interview."
32463,sam,"(sighs) Okay. For everybody who works outside the building, I'll fall on the sword.  But for everybody who works inside the building, I wasn't there!"
32464,sam,Didn't get much of a tan.
32465,sam,"Capitol Beat, Capitol Gang, Inside Politics."
32466,sam,The President isn't an elitist. He respects everyone.
32467,sam,"Congratulations again, by the way."
32468,sam,Uh-oh.
32469,sam,"We're of the belief that if you're going to set policy, it'd be a bonus to understand it.  And at this point, we'd be astonished to discover that Ritchie had read as many as six  journal articles on anything other athletic support mechanisms."
32470,sam,252 million people in the country. You don't think we'd ought to be able to elect somebody  who's got both?
32471,sam,Good advisors could better advise informed and curious Presidents.
32472,sam,"All right. Let's clear up a couple of things, 'cause that's the second time you've invoked  the ""Evil Eight"". First of all, Notre Dame isn't a member of the Ivy League. They play  football as an independent. They play basketball in the Big East. Second, we're very  interested in education in this White House, so can you tell me what's wrong with the  Ivy League? Should we be discouraging parents from hoping there kids get into Princeton  and Yale and Dartmouth?"
32473,sam,"Yeah, except, that's not all you know because you're bright and you're curious and you  worked hard, and you got into Smith and you got your law degree where? Cambridge,  Massachusetts. You lose, I win. 'Twas ever thus."
32474,sam,Life's tough in the aluminum siding business. Check the press office on your TV schedule.
32475,sam,I'll talk to Babish.
32476,sam,You bet.
32477,c.j.,Toby?
32478,toby,Yes.
32479,c.j.,We've gone from one network carrying the press conference tomorrow night to four.
32480,toby,Are you kidding?
32481,c.j.,No.
32482,toby,I guess we shouldn't be surprised.
32483,c.j.,No. Where are you going?
32484,toby,Sightseeing.
32485,c.j.,Really?
32486,toby,Tabitha's never been to Washington.
32487,c.j.,"You going to get that thing done, or you want me to talk to her?"
32488,toby,It's going to be fine.
32489,c.j.,You sure?
32490,toby,She's a poet. She's new to things like consequences.
32491,c.j.,Okay.
32492,toby,All four networks...
32493,c.j.,"Listen, I have a crazy thought. Is it possible...?"
32494,toby,What?
32495,c.j.,"Hmm, never mind. I'll see you later."
32496,toby,Okay.
32497,josh,Donna?
32498,josh,Something weird has happened here.
32500,josh,LemonLyman....
32502,josh,They don't seem to be taking my response in the spirit in which it was intended.
32504,josh,"Seems to be a very unusual social structure. For instance, there is leader who seems  to pride herself on her organizational skills and a certain amount of discipline."
32506,josh," Well, she does seems to do an awful lot of scolding. ""You've  posted in the wrong place. Stay on topic people. Don't use capital letters. I don't have  time to tell you twice,"" when clearly, she does have time to tell us twice. But that's  not the problem."
32508,josh,"""Someone need to deal with Josh's planet-sized ego, by teaching him government 101.  Who made him overlord of the Democratic party?"" And someone else writes, ""Is Josh  delusional, or is he actively trying to destroy the separation of powers?"""
32511,josh,I think I need to clarify my original post.
32513,josh,Sit down in the chair.
32515,josh,Sit down in the chair.
32517,josh,"I'm dictating now. I don't think it falls under the category of ""outrageous"" to suggest  that I might have friends on the other end of the Avenue who have the phone number of  the GAO. Let me put this more plainly. The White House can get a GAO review of anything  it wants without posing a threat to the separation of powers. And I believe I'll use  capital, lowercase, or Sanskrit, right up until the moment the font police cuff me and  read me Miranda!"
32519,josh,"See, I think these are good people, by and large, but they've come under the thumb of a  dictatorial ruler. So, as with a small, Central American country, my role is to incite  the people to topple her"
32521,josh,"No, but do we have any Yoo-Hoo?"
32523,josh,I'll take one.
32525,toby,What are you doing?
32526,toby,Yes.
32527,toby,I'll let you know if it happens.
32528,toby,We have you watched when you're in D.C.
32529,toby,No.
32530,toby,We always have you watched.
32531,toby,"So, you know what I was thinking might be fun?"
32532,toby,That's not what I was going to say at all.
32533,toby,"If you came to the dinner, wore a beautiful dress, and shut the hell up."
32534,toby,We're aware of all nine.
32535,toby,I work in communications.
32536,toby,"The President of the United States requests the honor of your presence, and I'm sorry,  but you show up."
32537,toby,"Not every minute of the damn day, Tabitha."
32538,toby,Can we stop with the drama?
32539,toby,"Tabitha, you don't know what you're doing. This isn't kid's stuff. If you stand up in the  President's face, that's going to be the story, and nobody's going to care about what you  care about. Nobody is going to care about what you care about. And... It'll be bad... for  you, for us, for the land mines, everybody."
32540,toby,Yeah.
32541,toby,Yeah.
32542,bartlet,"(singing) Another sky Another June Another something that rhymes with June Another reason, another season For making... (stops singing) Wait a sec."
32543,bartlet,"No, wait a sec. He's absolutely right. Hang on."
32544,bartlet,"Excuse me. I'm sorry for interrupting. No, no, keep your seats. Leo? You're absolutely right."
32545,leo,About what?
32546,bartlet,"We shouldn't show up. Tell the Whip we want to yield all our time. While they're going  in front of the cameras complaining about me making fun of Ritchie, the Democrats will  be caucusing on literacy and tuition tax credits. We want to yield all our time."
32547,leo,"Yes, sir."
32548,bartlet,Thank you.
32549,c.j.,"The President will begin his press conference at nine, or more accurately, the walk down  the red carpet will happen at 9:01:30, per the network's request. He'll deliver an opening  statement on his National Strategy for Energy Independence, we expect that'll last about  15 minutes, and then the President will take questions for 45 minutes."
32550,c.j.,Really?
32551,sam,She's got a point there.
32552,sam,"I don't grant your premise, but..."
32553,sam,I don't care.
32554,sam,"Because before I look for anything, I look for a mind at work. Nobody's saying the President  needs to have a tenured chair in semiotics, but you have to have..."
32555,sam,Gravitas.
32556,sam,"You don't, but we know it when we see it, and Republicans tend to mock it when they do.  You think I'm wrong?"
32557,sam,"No you don't, and the way I know you don't is I saw you say so on television. "
32558,sam,"Hey, Toby."
32559,toby,Why are you here?
32560,sam,The TV isn't working in my office.
32561,toby, You did good on TV.
32562,sam,How's it going with the poet?
32563,toby,I'm not sure.
32564,sam,Does she have a strong history of activism?
32565,toby,"She has no history of activism. She said something yesterday, when I was with her, she said-  she was talking about land mines - she said, ""From everything I've seen and everything I've  been told..."""
32566,sam,You think she's getting some pressure?
32567,toby, I don't-
32568,toby, Yeah.
32569,josh,The Internet people have gone crazy.
32571,josh,"They're calling the GAO ""General Josh's Standing Army"", and saying I don't understand  it's mandate and purpose. They're saying if I could get a review of anything I want,  that I should start by reviewing the job of Deputy C.O.S. Then one guy compares me to  a poor man's Clark Clifford, and a page and a half of posts, debating whether or not  I was mocking Egyptians with the Sanskrit reference."
32573,josh,I thought you meant they were funny.
32575,josh,"I know they're not! It's ""Lord of the Flies"" in there."
32577,josh,"It's got my name on it. Look, I don't want to hear about it anymore.   We got an energy plan in ten minutes. I'm gonna..."
32578,c.j.,Oh Josh!
32579,josh,Yeah?
32580,c.j.,The Federal Page of the Washington Post just called Carol to confirm that you're the  Josh Lyman who stated on an Internet website that the White House could order a GAO  review on anything it wants.
32581,josh,Without threatening the separation of powers is what I was saying.
32582,c.j.,You posted on a web site?
32583,josh,I was communicating with the people.
32584,c.j.,Really?
32585,josh,"C.J., it's a... crazy place. It's got this dictatorial leader, who I'm sure wears a muumuu  and chain smokes Parliaments. "
32586,c.j.,What did you go there for in the first place?
32587,josh,It's called LemonLyman.com.
32588,c.j.,"Let me explain something to you, this is sort of my field. The people on these sites?  They're the cast of ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest."" "
32589,josh," I didn't swoop in, I came in exactly the same way everybody else did."
32590,c.j.,"Well, now I'm telling you to open the ward room window and climb on out before they give you  a pre-frontal lobotomy, and I have to smother you with a pillow."
32591,josh,You're Chief Brom-
32592,c.j.,"I'm Chief Bromden, yes, at this particular moment. I'm assigning an intern from the press  office to that web site. They're going to check it every night before they go home. If they  discover you've been there, I'm going to shove a motherboard so far up your ass... "
32593,c.j.,What?
32594,josh," Well... technically, I outrank you."
32595,c.j., So far up your ass!
32596,josh, Okay.
32597,c.j.,Okay?
32598,josh,How you doing?
32599,c.j.,Are we ready?
32600,josh, We are.
32601,c.j.,I believe we are. You want to walk over?
32602,josh," Donna, let's go, it's time."
32603,toby,Excuse me?
32604,toby,What happened?
32605,toby,Where is she?
32606,toby,Okay. Thanks.
32607,toby,Was there any press there tonight?
32608,toby,Right.
32609,toby,What happened tonight?
32610,toby,What?
32611,toby,"Yeah, we can do that. "
32612,toby,What's that say?
32613,toby,I have to be at a press conference.
32614,c.j.,"So as a matter of cold fact, Chipper, you'll see that it's the Porcupine Caribou, and  ANWARS's their calving ground, and you can't put a price tag on that, but that's hardly  the point."
32615,c.j.,"Well, forget the wildlife, it hurts flesh and blood subsistence hunters in the area,  changes migratory patterns in ways we don't even understand, increases freezing depths  of rivers and lakes..."
32616,c.j.,"Welcome home, it'll cause pollutant haze and acid rain, and all this in exchange for?"
32617,bartlet,"All right, here we go. What time is it?"
32618,leo, We'll see you inside.
32619,bartlet," Thank you, everyone. "
32620,c.j.,"Yes, sir?"
32621,bartlet,"I've been meaning to tell you, you've done really well this week with the open-mike thing."
32622,c.j.,Thank you.
32623,bartlet,Didn't turn out too bad.
32624,c.j.,"No sir, it didn't turn out too bad at all. In fact, the whole country's talking about  whether Ritchie's smart enough to be President. And you didn't take hit, 'cause it was an  accident. You know, it occurs to me that even your choice of language was interesting.  ""A .22 caliber mind, in a .357 magnum world."" That's unusual for you, a gun metaphor. "
32625,c.j.,That was Old School. 
32626,c.j.,Go knock 'em dead.
32627,leo,"I'll fund the plane, but I'm not gonna fly on it."
32628,leo,Why?
32629,sam,You wanted me?
32630,josh,You guys go out?
32631,sam,Toby had Capitals tickets.
32632,josh,Good game?
32633,sam,"You know what I'd do if I... No, it wasn't. You know what I'd do if I owned a hockey  team? I'd hire a sumo wrestler. I'd give him a uniform, transportation, 500 bucks a week  to sit in the goal, eat a ham sandwich, and enjoy the game. My team would never get  scored on."
32634,josh,Your team would get scored on constantly.
32635,sam,"Maybe, but we'd sell a few tickets."
32636,josh,"Yeah, 'cause sumo wrestling sells out all the time in big hockey towns."
32637,sam,My idea's totally inviable?
32638,josh,"Well, you're a Democrat. It's a pretty big club."
32639,sam,What did you need?
32640,josh,"Uh, health, education and welfare is marking up the Internet Education Act tomorrow."
32641,sam,Tomorrow?
32642,josh,Yeah.
32643,sam,And they told us when?
32644,josh,An hour ago. They're zeroing out the Technology Challenge Fund.
32645,sam,That's the Vice President's thing.
32646,josh,You want to know for how long? I was working for him when he created it.
32647,sam,Does he know?
32648,josh,No.
32649,sam,What do you think he's gonna say when you tell him?
32650,josh,"I think he's gonna say, ""Josh, you look remarkably like Sam Seaborn."""
32651,sam,I could think of a lot of people who are better suited to this than I am.
32652,josh,Who?
32653,sam,Leo.
32654,josh,Leo says you.
32655,sam,Why didn't he say you?
32656,josh,"I don't have the best relationship with Hoynes, and neither does Leo."
32657,sam,"I don't understand. You just go in there and say, ""I'm sorry, Mr. Vice President. It  isn't gonna happen. Don't you think he's gonna be miffed if it comes from the Deputy  Communications Director?"
32658,josh,"Well, we don't want you to say I'm sorry. We want you to work with him and save the bill."
32659,sam,"Oh, all right. When?"
32660,josh,His office is expecting you in 20 minutes.
32661,sam,What about the meeting?
32662,josh,My meeting?
32663,sam,Yeah.
32664,josh,You'll come late.
32665,sam,You still don't want to tell me what it's about?
32666,josh,No big deal. You'll find out when you get there.
32667,sam,All right. 
32668,josh,Thank you.
32669,josh,I've lost my binder from National Strategies.
32671,josh,The black one with the secret launch codes.
32673,josh,"I also need the Cabinet Affairs amplification report, and if you can get th AP farm guy  back online, I'm almost sure Toby gave me a punchier quote on Ag reorganization."
32675,josh,You 'shall'?
32677,josh,How about a weekly salary of some kind?
32679,josh,Name it.
32681,josh,What do you need?
32683,josh,"For me, it was Mr. Feig for American History AP and Con Law."
32685,josh,And the big favor you want?
32687,josh,"No. I think that moment's done, except to say that he meant the whole world to me, and  he died four years ago."
32689,josh,Not quite as bad as dying.
32691,josh,Molly Morello Day?
32693,josh,Yes.
32695,josh,That would be a nice letter from the principal.
32697,josh,"A little piece of paper? Proclamations have the full force of law. The Emancipation  Proclamation, to name just one."
32699,josh,"Listen. I-I don't know what's involved with these things. Probably have advisory boards,  commissions, the NATO commander's involved, prossibly."
32701,josh,"Yeah, but find me the blue notebook first."
32703,josh,I'm going to the meeting now.
32704,sam,Got a minute?
32705,toby,"If I said no, would it stop you?"
32706,sam,No. NEAP figures are out today.
32707,toby,Okay.
32708,sam,They're up.
32709,toby,"So instead of trailing 18 third world countries in reading and math, we trail how many?"
32710,sam,"Up's better than down. Either way, it's news. The Education Secretary ought to make a  statement."
32711,toby,Tomorrow's no good. We've got half a dozen events on the books.
32712,sam,We keep saying education is out number one priority.
32713,toby,"And tomorrow, we're trying to make news on five of our other number one priorities.  Don't you have a meeting?"
32714,sam,"Two meetings, actually."
32715,toby,"Oh, I'll check the calendar."
32716,sam,Up's better than down.
32717,toby,Where to find a chisel and a stone tablet.
32718,toby,I need to know what the Cabinet's doing tomorrow.
32719,toby,"Ideally, sometime before tomorrow."
32720,toby,Is it... Go back. What's at noon?
32721,toby,"No, the Housing Secretary."
32722,toby,Page the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. I want to see him in my office.
32723,toby,Look at my face.
32724,toby,I'm in the Roosevelt Room.
32725,toby,Please. 
32726,bartlet,"Okay. We're e-filing the old 1040A. You're single, head of your household, Deanna's a  dependent, your adjusted gross income is $35,000 per annum."
32727,bartlet,I love doing this.
32728,bartlet,Yeah.
32729,bartlet,Yeah.
32730,bartlet,What?
32731,bartlet,Suckers. Okay. Your mom's Social Security pension benefits is $1536. Police pension $2400.
32732,bartlet,"""Do you take standard deduction, or do you itemize?"""
32733,bartlet,Did you make any charitable donations?
32734,bartlet,Really?
32735,bartlet, You're better off with the standard deduction.
32736,bartlet,"I'm hitting 'send' now. If you're lying about any of this, you're going to the joint."
32737,bartlet,"It's gonna tell us what your refund is, but I've done a quick calculation, and it'll be  $700."
32738,bartlet,"You spent it already, haven't you?"
32739,bartlet,Yeoman of the Guard?
32740,bartlet,Can I tell you what's messed up about James Bond?
32741,bartlet,Shaken not stirred will get you cold water with a dash of gin and dry vermouth. The  reason you stir it with a special spoon is so not to chip the ice. James is ordering a  weak martini and being snooty about it.
32742,bartlet,Okay.
32743,bartlet,400.
32744,bartlet,You owe $400.
32745,bartlet,And you don't even need a stamp. Hand it over.
32746,bartlet,Whatever. Hand it over.
32747,bartlet,That's not quite how we see it.
32748,bartlet,Sure.
32749,c.j.,"Good evening, Mr. President."
32750,bartlet,You need me?
32751,c.j.,"Yes, sir."
32752,bartlet,"Let's go inside.  Milo, Coop, would you help Mr. Young find his pockets, please?"
32753,c.j.,"I'm sorry to come straight to you, but Leo's unavailable right now. You should be getting  a call from the Energy Secretary any minute."
32754,bartlet,What happened?
32755,c.j.,The wire service is reporting that a heavy-haul vehicle carrying depleted uranium fuel  rods crashed in the Seven Devil Mountains in Idaho.
32756,bartlet,It crashed?
32757,c.j.,"It was hit head-on by another truck, in the Goldfield Tunnel on Route 234."
32758,bartlet,Are there populated areas nearby?
32759,c.j.,"Elk Horn's about 20 miles away with a population of 20,000."
32760,bartlet,Charlie?
32761,bartlet,Conference in the Chief with the Radiological Assistance Team.
32762,bartlet,"Charlie, get me Fitzwallace, Nancy McNally, and let the senior members of the NSC know  I might need them tonight."
32763,c.j.,"Thank you, Mr. President. "
32764,bartlet, Yeah.
32765,c.j.,A truck carrying depleted uranium fuel rods just crashed in Idaho 20 miles from a  populated town.
32766,josh,"Well, what's happening right now?"
32767,c.j.,"The President's talking to Tommy about the radiation threat, and he's talking to some  National Security people."
32768,c.j.,I'm just telling them.
32769,toby,Why National Security?
32770,c.j.,What?
32771,toby,You said he was also talking to National Security People.
32772,c.j.,"Two trucks in a completely deserted area, and they just happen to crash into each other?  I'd want to talk to somebody at least."
32773,josh,"All right. Listen, postpone the meeting. "
32774,toby,"No, let's do it."
32775,josh,It's gonna be all night.
32776,toby,"When we get pulled out, we get pulled out."
32777,josh,It doesn't really seem appropriate right now.
32778,toby,You spent a long night with Bruno last night.
32779,josh,"Yeah, and Bruno spent a long night with Doug the night before."
32780,c.j.,And?
32781,josh,There's no electoral math they can come up with. None. That says it's not worth exploring  replacing the Vice President on the ticket.
32782,toby,"Not five months ago, in this room I'd said-I joked--that if we win re-election it was  going to be on the Vice-President's coattails. The way I'm sure I said it is that it was  leaked. How has the electoral math changed since then?"
32783,josh,"By the way... the group of people were chosen because they're the people Leo wanted to  hear from tonight but also, because he was confident their wouldn't be a leak and I hope  we live up to that."
32784,toby,How has the math changed?
32785,josh,"Bruno doesn't think that Hoynes buys us Texas with Ritchie in the race. If we loose Texas  this time, we loose Florida this time, that's a third of the electoral votes we need to  win. There's a reason the Republicans are nominating this man."
32786,c.j.,Who does?
32787,josh,What? 
32788,c.j.,Who does win Texas for us?
32789,josh,"Nobody, we're loosing Texas."
32790,toby,"Wait a second, before we go on to who does win Texas."
32791,c.j.,I was just saying...
32792,toby,We've been talking about this for a minute and 17 sec and we're already discussing new  candidates?
32793,c.j.,I was saying that if no ones going to win us Texas then why change it all?
32794,josh,Can I make it clear that nobody's advocating anything?
32795,toby,Bruno and Doug are.
32796,josh,Bruno asked for a discussion.
32797,toby,"The Northeast, the Pacific coast and the industrial Northwest. "
32798,josh,Yeah. If we don't have Florida and Texas it'd mean we'd have to sweep those three.
32799,josh,Yeah.
32800,josh,He thinks someone else could help us more.
32801,c.j.,Did he say who? 
32802,josh,Yes.
32803,c.j.,Who? 
32804,josh,"Fitzwallace. He said Fitzwallace, Toby. And when you think about it..."
32805,toby,Yeah.
32806,leo, Josh.
32807,josh,Yeah.
32808,leo,How's it going in there?
32809,josh,Ah... you know... we're just starting.
32810,leo,Well make sure you get creative. Get people thinking even though you know it's...
32811,josh,Yeah.
32812,leo,I'm going to go in there alone for a minute.
32813,bartlet,Hey.
32814,leo,I was just briefed. They're setting up a joint operations command in Elks Horn. I wish  I'd been here a half hour ago.
32815,bartlet,What would you have done a half hour ago that hasn't already been done?
32816,leo,I'd have known a half hour ago what I know now. This is exactly why I'm not going to my  meeting anymore--it's a luxury.
32817,bartlet,"I know. If only technology could invent some way to get in touch with you in an  emergency. Some sort of telephonic device with a personalized number we could call to let  you know that we needed you. Perhaps it would look something like this, Mr. Moto!  "
32818,leo,You should've called me.
32819,bartlet,Would you stop?
32820,leo,All right. Obviously we're coordinating with the governor's office and state FEMA in  Boise. 
32821,bartlet,You know I've noticed that other people keep a set of comfortable clothes in their office  for when they have to work late. I like that -- you should do that too.
32822,leo,I do do that.
32823,bartlet,Oh. You should change.
32824,leo,You see me wearing a necktie?
32825,bartlet,Never mind.
32826,leo,Can I have my pager back? 
32827,leo,The hazard assessment by the RAD team is good. No airborne release of cesium isotopes.  No gamma or neutron radiation readings.
32828,bartlet,But?
32829,leo,Both trucks are still burning. The fire commander's pulling out his men and equipment  as soon as possible.
32830,bartlet,I'm pretty sure he's right.
32831,leo,"Yeah these things haven't tested for tunnel fires. They're built to withstand 1,475  Fahrenheit for 30 minutes but apparently a train tunnel in Baltimore burned at 1,500."
32832,bartlet,"Yeah, Leo?"
32833,leo,Yes sir.
32834,bartlet,I knew this a half hour ago.
32835,leo,Right.
32836,bartlet,This whole night I'm going to be a half hour smarter than you.
32837,leo,Ok. So you know about the other truck.
32838,bartlet, No.
32839,leo,It was stolen from a rest stop outside of Glen's Ferry two weeks ago.
32840,bartlet,The driver's dead?
32841,leo,Yeah.
32842,bartlet,Arab?
32843,leo,No. He's Garry Vernon Clarke.
32844,bartlet,Is that his name or is that what we think it is right now?
32845,leo, Looks like it was an accident.
32846,bartlet,In what happens to be the most dangerous and unanticipated situation for the  transportation of nuclear waste.
32847,leo,Yes. 
32848,bartlet, What's that meeting next door?
32849,leo,Don't worry about it.
32850,josh,"Did I leave a folder called ""Southeast Targets and..."" "
32851,josh,Thank you.
32853,josh,What has to be done?
32855,josh,Donna.
32857,josh,He can't just issue a proclamation.
32859,josh,"No I'm saying he can't just because you want him to. What's next, executive clemency if  you're having a bad hair day?"
32861,josh,"Which is nice but these things are for important causes, not individual perks for  staffers."
32863,josh,When was that?
32865,josh,"Look, if you're going to mock the dead..."
32867,josh,It's still the President's name and reputation. We haven't vetted this woman.
32869,josh,If she were a lesbian we could talk. I'm saying what if she's a bicycle thief?
32871,josh,"Don't doubt it. Know it. Do a Google search, then talk to me."
32872,sam,"Good evening, sir. No, that's fine."
32873,sam,I love poker.
32874,sam,"Yes, sir."
32875,sam,Not very good.
32876,sam,No.
32877,sam, They're marking up the Internet Education Act tomorrow.
32878,sam,"Yes sir, and they're zeroing out the Technology Challenge Fund."
32879,sam,"Yes, sir. We only heard about it tonight."
32880,sam,That's what I'm here for. 
32881,sam,It's going to be embarrassing.
32882,sam,"Yeah, the problem is..."
32883,sam,The Chairman. You attacked him at the DNC Spring...
32884,sam,I understand.
32885,sam,Yes sir.
32886,sam,Yes sir.
32887,toby,Does anyone even know if he's a Democrat?
32888,josh,He would be now.
32889,josh,"These guys are right. Black turn out would explode, we'd realign the country."
32890,c.j.,That's assuming it stays a two-man race.
32891,josh,Who's going to get into it this late?
32892,toby,John Hoynes.
32893,josh,"Hoynes, as... an Independent?"
32894,toby,Yeah.
32895,josh,The guy practically has corporate sponsorship. The Tostitos Vice President is going to  lead an independent movement?
32896,josh,It is that ridiculous! He'd be finished in politics.
32897,toby,Some future he'll have after we publicly humiliate him by kicking him off the ticket.
32898,josh,"So, bring it on. What are we afraid of?"
32899,c.j.,How about a household name with his own base of conservative Democrats and populist  Independents.
32900,toby,"Starts at 15, maybe 20%. Now, every state's up for grabs 'cause it's a three way."
32901,josh,But he'll loose.
32902,c.j.,"Which is gratifying, of course but not much of a consolation since we'll loose too."
32903,josh,"You say what you want, Hoynes is a pragmatist. To do this, he'd be the craziest Vice  President since Aaron Burr-and Burr shot a guy.  I can't believe we're  talking about this."
32904,c.j.,It's your meeting.
32905,josh,I'm getting that a lot these days.
32906,c.j.,So... that leaves us where?
32907,josh,Wondering if Fitzwallace is a Democrat or a Republican.
32908,leo,"Yeah, it sounds like you're getting tripped up by 1783."
32909,leo,HR 1783; it's a tax rebate from last year.
32910,leo,Did you get a tax rebate last year?
32911,leo,There's the answer.
32912,leo,Your rebate came off of this year's taxes. That's how we paid for it. 
32913,leo,Yeah.
32914,leo,"Well, technically I guess..."
32915,leo,"This doesn't sound like very patriotic talk to me, Charlie. They enter Charlie's office."
32916,leo,"So people would spend it. If they thought it was an advance, they might save it."
32917,leo,Did you spend it?
32918,leo,We would have preferred it if you'd ate in a restaurant or travelled.
32919,leo,"Well, in any event... "
32920,bartlet,Leo.
32921,leo,He used the rebate to pay off his VISA bill.
32922,bartlet,A trip to Banana Republic would have killed you?  Let's go.
32923,leo,The problem is we don't know anything.
32924,bartlet,That's never been a problem for us before.
32925,leo,"We don't know anything until we can get into the tunnel, and we can't get into the tunnel  until the place cools down. Until we can get into the tunnel we don't know if we have to  evacuate Elk Horn."
32926,bartlet,"Well, that's FEMA's call, isn't it?"
32927,leo,"FEMA's indicated they're going to want to make it the Governor's call, and the Governor's  indicated that he's going to want you to step in and..."
32928,bartlet,"I should set a ransom. I'll tell you what the radiation levels are, but first I want your  electoral votes. Or is that a bad strategy?"
32929,leo,Pretty bad.
32930,bartlet,"Okay, no ransom. We'll play this one straight. What about other shipments?"
32931,leo,"There are two other shipments on the road tonight. One's low level radioactive waste,  mostly medical. It's being shipped on three rail cars in South Carolina."
32932,bartlet,Have we stopped the train?
32933,leo,Yeah. The National Guard's going to secure it until we know what happened.
32934,bartlet,What about the second?
32935,leo,"That's more problematic. There's about 200 pounds of what's called ""trans-uranic""  material from Rocky Flats where they assemble the nuclear triggers. They're about 150  miles away from Carlsbad and we can't tell them to pull over 'cause that makes them more  vulnerable."
32936,bartlet,They beefed up the escort?
32937,leo,Yeah.
32938,bartlet,Ok.
32939,leo,"Thank you, Mr. President."
32940,c.j.,Grant works as an example in almost any situation.  That's Grant's legacy.
32941,toby,Plus he won the Civil War.
32942,josh,What about Leo?
32943,leo,What'd I do?
32944,josh,As running mate. Bartlet-McGarry. 
32945,leo,Done.
32946,josh,It's not absurd you know.
32947,leo,"Yes, it is."
32948,josh,It's not totally absurd.
32949,leo,"Yes, it is. "
32950,toby,He wants your parking space.
32951,josh,I really do.
32952,c.j.,It's not totally absurd.
32953,leo,You have a good parking space.
32954,c.j.,"You know, if it weren't for the drinking and the valium... And yet Grant... "
32955,toby,That's right.
32956,c.j.,"And yet Grant. They went to Lincoln. They said, ""Grant's a drunk"". He said, ""Send all my  generals a case of whatever he's drinking""."
32957,leo,You guys don't think an alcoholic can be Vice-President? You really think the 20th  century didn't see an alcoholic in the West Wing? I'll be around. 
32958,josh,Hey... Leo. That didn't mean anything?
32959,leo,"Yeah, I didn't take anything."
32960,josh, What's going on in Idaho?
32961,leo,The tunnel's still hot. We're looking at evacuating Elk Horn. 
32962,josh,Elk Horn's 20 000.
32963,leo,Yeah. 
32964,josh,We've done this before?
32965,leo,"For hurricanes, yeah."
32966,josh,This is a radioactive cloud.
32967,leo,I wouldn't call it a cloud.
32968,josh,You wouldn't call it the end of the Yankee game either.
32969,leo,"I don't know. You've got your sirens, route and tunnel alerts on local radio and TV.  Paul Reveres go out..."
32970,josh,Civil defence volunteers?
32971,leo,"Yeah, we've got the armoury in Caldwell, 75 miles away for refugees."
32972,josh,"Still, we're talking about widespread panic and chaos, right?"
32973,leo,I assume. Anything else?
32974,josh,I don't want to go back to my meeting.
32975,leo,Well you're not staying here.
32976,josh,Okay. 
32977,sam,There are three rural members on the committee who love distance learning.
32978,sam,Sir?
32979,sam,"Well, one of the problems is they're deficit hogs."
32980,sam,That's the other problem.
32981,sam,"They want your name off the bill. Sir, they want your name off of it. They love this  bill. Helping the poor learn computers so they can lift themselves up by their bootstraps  it gets voted out of committee unanimously. But it's an election year."
32982,sam,"Absolutely, Mr Vice President."
32983,sam,"Yes, sir."
32984,toby,Where's Secretary Fisher?
32985,toby,Excuse me?
32986,toby,"""She."""
32987,toby,You paged him?
32988,toby, Call Fisher or his scheduler and say that I want the Secretary here in half  an hour to talk about moving his announcement to the White House briefing room... 'cause  we have more TV cameras.
32989,toby,The most dangerous place in Washington is between Bill Fisher and a TV camera.
32991,josh,Thank you.
32993,josh,Look...
32995,josh,What?
32997,josh,We are just a little rococo aren't we?
32999,josh,I wish I knew who General Pulaski was.
33001,josh,She's not less worthy. But neither is she more worthy than the other 90 000 public school  teachers who are retiring this year.
33003,josh,But that's where we get into trouble.
33005,josh,"""Who would find out"" is also where we frequently find trouble."
33007,josh,Yes.
33009,sam,Hey.
33010,josh,You get it done?
33011,sam,Yeah.
33012,josh,He's taking his name off it?
33013,sam,Yeah.
33014,josh,"Well, it feels like we're almost done in there."
33015,sam,You want to tell me what this meeting's about now.
33016,josh,Replacing Hoynes.
33017,sam,What are you talking about?
33018,josh,Bruno wanted us to look at replacing Hoynes. 
33019,sam,Josh.
33020,josh,"So, we're looking at it. What's the big...? We're looking at it. And everybody's treating  me like..."
33021,sam,Why?
33022,josh,There's electoral math.
33023,sam,Was I sent away?
33024,josh,No.
33025,sam,I wasn't sent to Hoynes' office so I wouldn't be at that meeting?
33026,josh,No.
33027,sam,"Is this ser... I mean, are you talking about names?"
33028,josh,"Fitzwallace, Leo, and Ulysses S. Grant."
33029,sam,"Not for nothing but before we go in there, I want to be clear. I didn't have to convince  him, or even suggest it. Right off the bat, he said ""Let's take my name off of it"". "
33030,leo,Yeah?
33031,leo,Yeah.
33032,leo,Thanks. You can go home now.
33033,leo, I'll get back to you.
33034,leo,Mr. Vice President. I like your style. 
33035,leo,It deserved to have your name on it.
33036,leo,Can you sit for a minute?
33037,leo,"I'm in a bind, and I think you know what it is."
33038,leo,"I have to respect the anonymity of an alcoholic and I can't reveal what's said in a  meeting but I've got a responsibility to the President, and in fact to the country.  And so..."
33039,leo,"John, you've got to tell the President."
33040,leo,That you're an alcoholic.
33041,leo,How would he know?
33042,leo,Of course I didn't tell him.
33043,leo,No.
33044,leo,No.
33045,toby,How was the NGA?
33046,toby, Good one.
33047,toby,"Yeah. Have you announced for the Governor of New Jersey, Bill?"
33048,toby,Did I miss and announcement somewhere?
33049,toby,"'Cause I've never heard of these home ownership loans, so I'm assuming it's a campaign  proposal. Camden and Newark will go nuts but I know it's not a national program."
33050,toby,You know how I know? 'Cause national programs are announced by the President of the  United States unless this White House passes on them first.
33051,toby,You're right. I forgot. We're announcing a brand new replacement for Social Security  tomorrow. 
33052,toby," They're not your nickels, Bill. They're not your dimes."
33053,toby,"Apparently you don't want his help, you're too busy helping yourself."
33054,toby,"There's one name on the ballot this November, Bill. Not yours, not mine. Not the Governor  of New Jersey. And believe me no one will work harder than Jed Bartlet to put you there.  But this President looses re-election and your career's finished, and so is mine."
33055,toby, Next time you announce new policy that isn't cleared by this office we're  announcing you're moving back to New Jersey.
33056,toby,C.J. will announce them tomorrow from the podium. 
33057,toby,This is too small for the President. I've got to go back to a meeting.
33058,bartlet,Yup. It was the rebate.
33059,bartlet,You say potato.
33060,bartlet,We wanted to inject some money into retail and tourism.
33061,bartlet,The economy might have improved on its own by then.
33062,bartlet,Yeah.
33063,bartlet,Not that much. Most people did what you did. They saved or they paid down debt.
33064,bartlet,"We do, but when the next guy's President."
33065,bartlet,I always do.
33066,bartlet,I'll tell you what I find interesting though.
33067,bartlet,"You. $35,000 a year, a sister to support, and you gave $1,435 to charity. I'm not so  sure that check isn't better off in your hands than ours. Oh, I'm taking it. Don't be  ridiculous. But when you get to your place tonight you're going to find a new DVD player  and that wimp-ass Bond movie."
33068,bartlet,And I threw in Yeoman of the Guard on CD.
33069,bartlet,I'm really something.
33070,leo,Mr. President.
33071,bartlet,"Hey, John."
33072,leo,"Can we have a minute please, sir?"
33073,bartlet,"Yeah. Charlie, let's get that woman on the phone. I'm feeling magical tonight."
33074,bartlet,They're in the tunnel now and the readings don't show anything beyond the predictable  level of background radiation. The flatbed is back on its way and the Carlsbad is behind  gates so we dodged the bullet.
33075,leo,Yeah.
33076,bartlet,"We packed this stuff in 2 inches of stainless steel, 4 inches of lead. We've rammed it  with trains and dropped it from helicopters and it still isn't going to protect us from  the thing we haven't thought of. They took a cask out to Aberdeen Proving Ground and shot  a TOW missile clean through it. They showed me video. What can I do for you?"
33077,leo,"Sir, there's something very important we need to talk to you about."
33078,bartlet,What?
33079,leo,"Well, it's delicate and surprising, and I want to make sure your first reaction is  measured so I'd like us to..."
33080,bartlet,Really?
33081,bartlet,Is there anybody left who's not?
33082,leo,Sir.
33083,bartlet,How long? 
33084,bartlet,For how long have you been in recovery?
33085,bartlet,Did you say 22?
33086,bartlet,You haven't had a drink since you were 22?
33087,bartlet,I didn't start drinking till I was 25. What the hell do you guys count as...
33088,bartlet,Twenty-two?
33089,bartlet,You and James Bond ought to team up.
33090,leo,Don't worry about it.
33091,bartlet,"He's ordering a watered down martini, and Leo what the hell is this meeting that's going  on all night across the hall?"
33092,leo,We can talk about it later.
33093,leo,"John, I assure you, I assure you, that if it were a serious notion we would..."
33094,leo,We're not doing it.
33095,bartlet,"Hey, did I hear right? Are you taking your name off that bill?"
33096,bartlet,You're taking your name off. We can't campaign on it.
33097,bartlet,"And if somebody's attacking us, you know what to do. "
33098,bartlet," Yeah, but don't discount the possibility  that it might be Leo."
33099,bartlet,"John, despite this recent revelation that you drank beer in college I've always liked you  a little more than you thought I did, but that's not why you're staying. It's this.   Four words. "
33100,bartlet,"Just a little, right?"
33101,bartlet,"Me, too. Anything else?"
33102,leo,"Thank you, Mr. President."
33103,bartlet,Charlie!
33104,bartlet,Let's go. I'm a magic man.
33105,bartlet, Donnatella.
33107,bartlet,Tell Josh that General Pulaski was a Polish Brigadier General who vanquished the Russian  and Prussian military then came to the colonies and commanded our cavalry during the  American revolution.
33109,bartlet,"It says here in a briefing paper hastily written by Deputy Josh Lyman that in the '60s  when the Madison Superintendent of Schools banned Twelfth Night for reasons passing  understanding, a Mrs. Molly Morello had students over to her house on Saturdays to  read it. "
33111,bartlet,Yeah 'cause all I had tonight was a nuclear spill in Idaho. It says she came in two hours  early to teach an AP English class she developed herself because the school didn't offer  one.
33113,bartlet,"Sounds like she deserves a proclamation. I wish I could give her one, but I can't. "
33115,bartlet,"It's just too much inside baseball, you know?"
33117,bartlet,"Charlie, I've been tapping my finger on the desk for about a minute now."
33118,bartlet,"The magic man thing works a lot better when you pick up on the signals, Tonto. What's  that you say? There's a phone call for Donna? "
33119,bartlet,"Good evening, this is the White House, for whom are you holding?"
33125,bartlet, Tell her where you are.
33127,bartlet, She didn't do anything.
33128,bartlet,"It's Jed Bartlet, Mrs. Morello. I've got a few questions. When you taught Beowulf, did  you make the kids read it in the original Middle English or did you use a translation?"
33129,bartlet,Okay. We're going to call that the James Bond version.
33130,bartlet,What are you planning on doing with your retirement?
33131,bartlet,I'd stay away from the Elk Horn area of Idaho for a little while. You'll read why in the  morning. Let's talk about Twelfth Night.
33132,c.j.,Twenty-two?
33133,c.j.,You haven't' had a drink since you were 22?
33134,c.j.,Ulysses S. Grant would have slapped your face.
33135,josh,"Listen, it's fine that this is funny and Mr. Vice President I couldn't care less, but  what about the campaign?"
33136,leo,What about it?
33137,josh,The President just got passed an honesty issue.
33138,toby,He's not passed it.
33139,josh,If it becomes public...
33140,c.j.,That's a big assumption.
33141,toby,No it's not.
33142,leo,I think that issue is probably worth further discussion but we're done talking about the  ticket. The President's made it very clear that he wants the Vice President to remain the  Vice President and he wrote down his one and only reason. 
33143,josh,"""Because I could die."" Well, of course he's right, sir."
33144,sam,Am I really the only one who thinks a giant sumo wrestler in a hockey goal might get the  job done?
33145,josh,I don't know. I'm open to new ideas.
33146,sam,"You want to make it clear that we're pushing for Slovenia and possibly the Baltic  states. Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania."
33147,c.j.,Not Fredonia? We're going to leave Fredonia out there?
33148,toby,"The point is, the zero option's off the table."
33149,c.j.,Hooray for Captain Spalding... 
33150,toby,Can we please?
33151,c.j.,"Hey, aren't we pretty much admitting all the countries we formed NATO to fight?"
33152,toby,Yes.
33153,c.j.,Then why not dissolve it?
33154,toby,We like the bomber jackets.
33155,c.j.," See, when you make a joke... "
33156,toby,My jokes are funny.
33157,c.j.,Fredonia was pretty good.
33158,toby,Heard it.
33159,c.j.," I'll give you $500 if you perform ""Lydia the Tattooed Lady"" at this year's Gridiron."
33160,sam, She's got to get in there. Can we talk about sugar subsidies?
33161,toby,We're not done talking about the summit!
33162,sam,It's a two-day grip and grin.
33163,toby,"And, you know, you of all people... the Russians finally elect a reformer, and you still... "
33164,sam,"20 years in the KGB, an election that will make Tammy Hall look like the League of  Woman Voters... I'm not sure that qualifies as a... C.J.?"
33165,c.j.," There was a fire at the King Fatah Middle School in Media.  Seventeen girls died in the fire, when they were prevented from coming out into the  street and rescue workers were prevented from saving them."
33166,sam, What was preventing them?
33167,c.j.,"The Muttawa. The girls weren't dressed properly. Don't comment! I haven't spoken to  the President, to Leo, to State, to anybody. You guys want to muzzle me before I go  in there, speak now or forever hold your peace. God knows it's not likely I'm gonna. "
33168,toby, Let's get a good spot.
33169,c.j.,Good morning!
33170,c.j.,"I have some scheduled details on the summit. Air Force One will depart Andrews at  7pm Friday, arriving at Helsinki 4am Eastern time, that's 11am Saturday local.  Presidents Bartlet and Chigorin will have their first meeting at three o'clock at  Mantyniemi - that's change, photo op, stills only, at the beginning of the meeting."
33171,c.j.,"Well, first to meet the new Russian president, but they show the aspiration of  building a secure and undivided Europe."
33172,c.j.,"Yeah, that's a tragedy. Chris?"
33173,c.j.,"Yeah, I read that too. Steve."
33174,c.j.,"I literally just got this a minute and a half ago. I haven't spoken to the President,  or Chief of Staff, State or anyone in communications, this is just me."
33175,c.j.,"I don't, no."
33176,c.j.," Outraged? I'm barely surprised. This is a country where women aren't allowed  to drive a car. They're not allowed to be in the company of any man other than a close  relative, they're required to adhere to a dress code that would make the Maryknoll Nun  look like Malibu Barbie. They beheaded 121 people last year for robbery, rape, and drug  trafficking, they've no free press, no elected government, no political parties, and  the royal family allows the religious police to travel in groups of six, carrying  nightsticks and they freely and publicly beat women. But ""Brutus is an honorable man.""  Seventeen schoolgirls were forced to burn alive because they weren't wearing the proper  clothing. Am I outraged? No, Steve. No Chris. No, Mark. That is Saudi Arabia, our  partners in peace. Bonnie, then Scott."
33177,sam,Where did he work?
33178,sam,No. What's his first name?
33179,sam,It's probably one of the guys early on. I didn't know any of them.
33180,sam, You mean San-Diego.
33181,sam, We never did a budget speech in Pittsburgh.
33182,sam,"Well, how many weird letters does the President get a day?"
33183,sam,"Well, how many confused people does the President befriend every day?"
33184,sam,I don't know. I'm on with the Russians. 
33185,sam,"Good morning, I'm Sam Seaborn."
33186,sam, Thanks for coming by. This should be quick. 
33187,sam,Let me first say that President Bartlet is looking forward to meeting with President  Chigorin and having a mutually productive meeting.
33188,sam,"That's right, but there are points I'd like to revisit. My thinking being - I could  relay my concerns to you at the embassy and you could send them on to Moscow and  hopefully, get an answer quickly 'cause we're coming down with it now."
33189,sam,"It's coming up quickly. The summit, it's Saturday, and this is Monday."
33190,sam,We've agreed to a consecutive translation?
33191,sam,I'd like to change that to a simultaneous translation.
33192,sam,"President Bartlet has a rhythm to his speaking pattern, and it's best if it's  uninterrupted. That's the only reason I bring it up."
33193,sam,"I'm sorry, pass it on?"
33194,sam," I'm sorry, it's just that one is good and one is bad. We'd already  agreed on the Grand Salon in Finlandia Hall for the 6:00 meeting and I wanted to change  that to the Hall of Flags."
33195,sam,It's funny you should mention that.
33196,sam,"It's funny...  It's a coincidence that you should happen  to mention the time of the meeting. See, President Chigorin only has to fly through one  time zone. President Bartlet has to fly through seven. Don't get me wrong, this President  can do three shows a night, but there's no one in the Western Hemisphere who has a worse  reaction to jetlag than he does. Any trip 8 hours or longer and someone gets fired at the  end of it, and it's already been me three times, so... "
33197,sam,I think everyone on the White House staff would agree when I say that one is a deal-breaker.
33198,sam,"Oh, yeah, we're just getting started. You guys hungry?"
33199,sam, Okay.
33201,c.j.,Yeah. Where are we going?
33203,c.j., Yeah. They're very angry faxes.
33205,c.j.,Yeah.
33207,c.j.,Very angry faxes from Saudis and angry e-mails. Look at these.
33209,c.j., Let's go.
33211,c.j.,I saw it.
33213,c.j.,It's not a big deal.
33215,c.j.,"Yeah. Don't tell anybody, okay, I don't want a lot of production."
33217,c.j.,Thanks.
33219,c.j.,Donna?! 
33220,josh,Look at what?
33222,josh,Call Frank Tenney downstairs. Tell him I want to talk to him right away.
33224,c.j.,You take this seriously?
33225,josh,"Yeah, it's a death threat, C.J., I take it seriously. "
33226,bartlet,Thank you all so much. Bye-bye. 
33227,bartlet,Bye-bye.
33228,leo,They have a picture they want to show us.
33229,bartlet,Of what?
33230,leo,I don't know.  We've got a problem. Jake Kimball came to see me this morning.
33231,bartlet,What's he doing here?
33232,leo,Looking a hundred years old. Antares is going to announce the chip recall on Thursday. 
33233,bartlet,How big?
33234,leo,Everything.
33235,bartlet, What are you talking about?
33236,leo,They discovered a problem with one of the... 
33237,bartlet,That's got to be 50 million chips!
33238,leo,80 million.
33239,bartlet,"Leo, how the hell did... "
33240,leo,I know.
33241,bartlet,That's the end of Antares.
33242,leo,Yeah.
33243,bartlet,"98 thousand workers, I think 75 thousand in the US. Plus the kidney punch at NASDAQ... "
33244,leo,"I think Jake's going to put a shotgun in his mouth, I really do."
33245,bartlet,Yeah.
33246,bartlet," Fitz! Fitz, you old polecat, you old so-and-so!"
33247,bartlet,Yeah.
33248,bartlet,Thank you.
33249,bartlet,Yeah.
33250,bartlet,What's the problem?
33251,bartlet,What do you use heavy water for?
33252,leo,Plutonium.
33253,toby,"Good morning, Janice!"
33254,toby,I think it's time we made it 'Toby.'
33255,toby,That's a nice uniform. How long have you guys had that uniform?
33256,toby,Okay.
33257,c.j.,"Hey, Toby."
33258,toby," I'm gonna tell you something, you ready?"
33259,c.j.,What?
33260,toby,I've got nothing to do.
33261,c.j., What do you mean?
33262,toby," I got to the office at six and it turned out that everything I was supposed  to do got done by seven thirty; some strange fluke of the calendar, so I'm just out  here walking around. You know, just being in the world."
33263,c.j.,In the hallways.
33264,toby,"Yeah. Well, you know, yeah."
33265,c.j.,"Well, I'm gonna change all that. I'd like you to meet with a Russian reporter named  Ludmila Koss, she's the Washington correspondent for the Novaya Gazeta, she wants  credentials and a seat on the press charter."
33266,toby,Why is she asking us?
33267,c.j.,The Russians banned her from the summit.
33268,toby,Why?
33269,c.j.,She supported the other guy.
33270,toby,"Aha. Time to teach these Stoli-drinking Tchaikovskys a thing or two about free press  American style! You don't ban those who supported you opponent, you make them wallow  in their losedom by covering your victory. You sit them in the front row. You give  them a hat! I will save Ludmila Koss, for I am Toby, and in doing so... Why am I going  on like this?"
33271,c.j., I don't know.
33272,toby,"Set up the meeting. Obviously, I have a little time."
33273,c.j.,Thank you.
33274,c.j.,Ron?
33275,c.j.,"Yeah, Josh made me see him yesterday. He filed everything he was supposed to file."
33276,c.j.,"It's just, you know, it's what it is... "
33277,c.j.,I just got here. 
33278,c.j.,Not explicitly.
33279,c.j.,No.
33280,c.j.,"Come on, Ron, I haven't had a boyfriend in a... I get a lot of hate mail. After the  President, I'm the single most visible person in the Federal government, every day I'm  on TV and every day exactly half the people are going to disagree with you and some of  those people are going to hate you and some of those are gonna write letters."
33281,c.j.,Sure. 
33282,c.j.,Why?
33283,c.j.,"At my briefing yesterday, I made some remarks about a situation in Saudi Arabia.  I may have gone too far, I was thinking about apologizing."
33284,c.j.,What do you mean?
33285,sam,Thank you.
33286,sam,Flags.
33287,sam,Okay.
33288,sam,Coat?
33289,sam,"Hang on. 'Cause yes, 'cause President Chigorin wants to wear a coat and doesn't want to  look like a wimp... "
33290,sam,Frumpy?
33291,sam,It's hard not to like a guy who doesn't know 'frumpy' but knows onomatopoeia. I'll talk to  the President about the coat. We'll have our final meeting tomorrow on the last points and  that will be that. 
33292,sam,Thank you. 
33293,sam,About what?
33294,sam,"Or maybe, it's just a crazy letter."
33295,sam,How do you know?
33296,sam,"I got a letter last year asking me if I would donate my brain to a medical school in Granada.  I'll tell you, there are days when I think, ""Yeah, why not just get it over with?"""
33297,sam,Why?
33298,sam,"Yeah, except they have a different name today."
33299,sam,The AFL-CIO and furnace workers are all unionized.
33300,toby,"Hey, Charlie."
33301,toby,Ms. Koss?
33302,toby,Toby Ziegler. Come on in.
33303,toby,You write for the Novaya Gazeta.
33304,toby,Your circulation's gotten huge.
33305,toby,"And it's hard to tell whether that's because of your reporting, your editorials, or the  naked women on page three. "
33306,toby,"Touche, madam.  So what did you do to piss off President Chigorin?"
33307,toby,Have you met someone who does?
33308,toby,"No, I... I'm just talking.  Listen, you're already credentialed to cover  our President, it's just a matter of putting you on a plane and, before I do that,  I want to check with the State department to make sure it's not a grotesquely insulting  thing to do to a new President from whom the US is hoping for quite a bit."
33309,toby,"No, it extends farther then that but it only protects us. Believe me, if we were able to  inforce US law around the world, I'd retire and go scuba-diving."
33310,toby,"I've never done it. I've... never done anything, but I've seen pictures and it looks fun.  I've seen pictures of people out there in the world, and they all look like they're glad  they are. Now, granted, when I'm looking at these pictures, somebody's usually trying to  sell me something, but tell you what: I'm 44 years old and I'm buying. I usually don't  talk this much, but I'm having an odd day. Want to stay for a little and look at pictures  of scuba-diving?"
33311,toby," Okay, then. We'll talk tomorrow."
33312,bartlet,Thank you so much. Thank you.
33313,leo,"Listen, before we go in there, let's stay a second and talk about Antares."
33314,bartlet,Yeah.
33315,leo,It's not like there's nothing we can do.
33316,bartlet,There's nothing we can do.
33317,leo,"I'm not saying Commerce or Treasury calls the banks, but an emergency loan guarrantee  if we can get Congress to... "
33318,josh," Good morning, sir."
33319,bartlet,"Good morning.  Yeah, we can't do it."
33320,leo,How did it go over there?
33321,josh,"Well, they confronted the RussiansAtomic Energy Minister with the photographs."
33322,leo,And?
33323,josh,He denies everything.
33324,bartlet,That's good enough for me.
33325,josh,He doesn't deny that they're building a reactor; they've had contracts with Iran since  '76 and he says that Deuterium-based reactors had been up and running in Canada for years.
33326,bartlet,"Well, Canada, Russia - roughly the same relationship with the US. Fitz, you old horse  thief, you old muckety-muck!"
33327,bartlet,Josh says the director of MinAtom says it's commercial power production.
33328,bartlet,"Well, that's what was said by my National Security Advisor twenty minutes ago, right after  it was said by the Secretaries of State and Defense. And, for what it's worth, the directors  of the CIA, NSA, FBI and Naval Intelligence."
33329,josh,"Leo, isn't MinAtom in terrible shape?"
33330,leo,It lost some customers after Chernobyl. 
33331,josh," Yeah, that's 'welcome to free markets the hard way,' but my point is the light water  reactor contracts are way behind schedule, there are all kinds of technical failures."
33332,bartlet,You think the Iranians forced them to build them a heavy water reactor?
33333,josh,"To satisfy the contracts, maybe."
33334,bartlet,"Crap. And even if that were the case, it doesn't make them Jean Valjean. They want to power  broker in the Middle East. Just what the doctor ordered for the Middle East. "
33335,bartlet,"All right, while avoiding the biggest diplomacy disaster since I don't know when -  Josh, Leo, you guys have to figure out a way to get me out of it."
33336,josh,Get him out of what?
33337,leo,He's not going to Helsinki. 
33338,josh,There's something... really good on television.
33339,leo,What?
33340,josh,"That's why he can't go, there's something really good on television and the President  doesn't know how to work a VCR. "
33341,josh,"Well, it's not that he doesn't know how to work it, they know he's got a staff and  wouldn't buy it. It's... It's that he doesn't trust technology."
33342,leo,Josh.
33343,josh,This is insane!
33344,leo,"News of the reactor is going to break, you know it will, and it's going to break at  the worst possible time. In fact, my money's on - it's gonna break right next to the  picture of him shaking hands with Chigorin. While wearing a coat, to protect his  MS-riddled body from the fierce climate in Finland."
33345,josh,"How can you guys, all of you, be so sure it's not MinAtom and the other Cold War  holdouts, the ex-Soviets, walking around... "
33346,leo,I don't care who it is... 
33347,josh,"There are other issues on the table! There's NATO expansion, the Caspian pipeline... "
33348,leo," We were all so smart. Russia's hobbled, the next conflict's going to be  in the Middle East. Turns out it is in the Middle East. With the Russians."
33349,josh,You haven't answered my question.
33350,leo,What question?
33351,josh,Chigorin just took office four months ago. How can you be sure it's not a rogue thing?
33352,leo,"I don't want a leak, Josh. Everyone's proceeding like we're going?"
33353,josh,Yes. How can you be sure?
33354,leo,I can't.
33355,toby,Thanks for coming down.
33356,toby,"I'm sorry, what did you say?"
33357,toby,"Yeah. I mean, I wanted to talk to you because I'd been asked to put a reporter from  the Novaya Gazeta on the press plane."
33358,toby,"You understand I'm talking about a pencil and pad of paper, from which no one has ever died."
33359,toby,"Well, the editorial judgement aside, what's the damage assessment?"
33360,toby,We make it clear it's not personal.
33361,toby,I don't know... What are the things I can do?
33362,toby,"If the Enquirer asked us, we'd credential them. Making sure the Enquirer can write whatever  it wants is the only way I can be sure the New York Times is writing whatever it wants."
33363,c.j.,Thanks. 
33364,c.j.,"Good morning, Mr. President."
33365,bartlet,"You're gonna get Secret Service protection, but I can't order it unless you sign this  piece of paper, so sign this piece of paper."
33366,c.j.,"Sir, can I ask why you feel it's necessary... "
33367,bartlet,"Because Ron says it is, and around here we do whatever Ron says."
33368,c.j.,"Well, I think it might be an over-reaction."
33369,bartlet,"Good for you. With all your years of training and experience in sniffing out crime,  your opinion really carries a lot of weight with me."
33370,c.j.,I don't want to appear fragile.
33371,bartlet,Are you kidding?
33372,c.j.,Sir... 
33373,bartlet,"We're talking about one bodyguard. I have twelve, and that's before I leave the house.  You ever count the number of guns that come along with me when Abbey and I take in a  play at the Kennedy Center? Do I seem fragile to you?"
33374,c.j.,"No, sir."
33375,bartlet,Then... 
33376,c.j.,"You're also not a woman in a man's job. To say nothing of the fact that you're required  by law to be protected by the Treasury Department. You don't have a choice. And frankly,  sir, you and I both know that you score points frequently with the public and with the  press by shrugging off your Secret Service and doing whatever... going to a book store."
33377,bartlet,I don't care.
33378,c.j.,Sir... 
33379,bartlet,"I don't care! You're part of my family, and this thing is happening and I simply won't  permit it. Sign the piece of paper."
33380,c.j.,Look... 
33381,bartlet,"Let me tell you something! The last time a member of my staff got a death threat, they  missed him and hit me!"
33382,c.j.,"Ron... is there any evidence... any evidence at all that this guy... Look, I work in the  White House, everybody knows that, but is there any evidence to suggest that... "
33383,c.j., Where did you get these?
33384,c.j.,"That's me leaving my house on Monday. This one's at a restaurant where I had dinner  with my niece. This one's from this morning... it was taken from about twenty feet away.  All right, okay. "
33385,c.j.,"Okay. Thank you, Mr. President."
33386,bartlet,Yeah!
33387,toby," Good morning, sir."
33388,bartlet,"Oh man, the greatest campaign speech ever about money - FDR promises to tighten our belts.  What's he do when he gets here - spends more than we knew could be spent. And it's 'cause  he discovered it's better for long-term growth. "
33389,toby,The journal probably wrote an editorial about his broken promises too.
33390,bartlet,"Hey, I should be able to reference that speech. When did he give that? It was in the  industrial North East."
33391,toby,"Pittsburgh, PA."
33392,bartlet,"Charlie, FDR gave a budget speech in 1932 in Pittsburgh, can you get your hands on a copy?"
33393,bartlet,"I said, FDR gave a budget speech in 1932... "
33394,bartlet,Okay.
33395,toby,"Thank you, Mr. President."
33396,bartlet,Mmm-hmmm.
33397,leo,Good morning.
33398,bartlet,How's it going?
33399,leo,"Is there a TV show you really, really like?"
33400,bartlet,No.
33401,leo,"Then don't worry about it, let's talk about something else."
33402,bartlet,What?
33403,leo,Helping out Antares.
33404,bartlet," Aaaah, was wilst du von mein Leben? What do you want from my life? The government  can't be in the business of cosigning loans."
33405,leo,"We wouldn't be handing them a bag of unmarked bills, just backing the loans to cover  the cost of the recall."
33406,bartlet, It's a subsidy.
33407,leo,It's a small one!
33408,bartlet,I'm an economist!
33409,leo,"Sir! This was not a failure of business, it was... I don't know, it was a mistake,  it was human error, and Jake's been completely forth... "
33410,bartlet,The marketplace will take care of Antares.
33411,leo,The marketplace will kill Antares.
33412,bartlet,That's what's supposed to happen.
33413,leo,"It's not like it's unprecedented, sir. We helped out steel."
33414,bartlet,That was an industry that was hurt by unfair trade practices. Antares was hurt by their  own carelessness.
33415,leo,A loan guarantee doesn't cost the taxpayers a nickel.
33416,bartlet,Unless they go under and either way they've just said 'We're open for business.'
33417,leo,"For a corporate icon that feeds into tech companies, computers, aerospace. The ripple  effects, workers losing jobs, it's a blue chip stock that's in every major... "
33418,bartlet, They were huge contributors! How the hell am I supposed... They were huge contributors! 
33419,leo,Carelessness doesn't have to exist for a mistake to be made.
33420,bartlet, What?
33421,leo,"You said it was carelessness and I don't believe carelessness has to exist for a mistake  to be made. Jake was a contributor, and he's never asked for a favor, not even now.  He was a contributor 'cause he knows us, and we know him, and we know, that if a mistake  happened in design or production at Antares it wasn't shoddy... it wasn't on the cheek.  You know how many chips have acted up so far? One. Dollars to donuts, he could have gotten  away with it. But he wanted to warn people they may have a problem before... I don't even  know what happens when 80 million computers stop working right. But tell me this isn't  exactly how we want American business to behave! I know it doesn't look good, he's a  friend of ours. But there is a reason he's a friend of ours."
33422,bartlet,They're announcing end of business tomorrow?
33423,leo,"Yes, sir."
33424,bartlet," I'm not saying anything, but grab some people and put together some numbers."
33425,leo,"Yes, sir."
33426,bartlet,I'm not saying anything.
33427,leo,"Thank you, Mr. President."
33428,sam,Why?
33429,sam,That is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard. Put whatever you want on the menu.
33430,sam,I would like to request that the press pool be allowed to take photographs in the  Arctic People's exhibit.
33431,sam,"And that, my good friends, is that. It was a pleasure doing business with you."
33432,sam,Name it!
33433,sam,"Well, I can't negotiate language of the statement."
33434,sam,"The language has been worked out with the State, Commerce, and Defense, it's way... "
33435,sam,Okay.
33436,sam,Whose idea was this?
33437,sam,Who wrote it?
33438,sam,Yeah.
33439,sam,Yes. Thank you.
33440,toby,Hello. 
33441,toby,"Here are your credentials for the plane, here's your plane ticket, here are your  credentials for the Palace, the Saturday press conference, the Arctic Peoples exhibit,  the Sunday press conference, and the Hall of Flags."
33442,toby,"Either way, I found out why Chigorin and his people have such a problem with you."
33443,toby,"No, it's because you stink."
33444,toby,"You can beg all you want, you're not gonna get it. Last month, you alleged that the  Chigorin government bombed several apartment buildings based on an unattributed source.  It was refuted; you never retracted!"
33445,toby," Last week, you had a cover story about President Chigorin's  mother-in-law moving closer to the Kremlin. You printed her home address, she had to relocate."
33446,toby,"You reported the failing grades of the Defense Minister's twelve-year-old son! Does that  even count as journalism? Does that do anything but bring ridicule on a defenseless kid?  We've got people like you here, on cable and on the Internet, and there's no one anywhere  on the ideological spectrum that doesn't roll their eyes when their names are spoken out  loud. You know, we've always had free press here, we take it for granted... how can you   Anyway. Here are your credentials. "
33447,leo,The Majority Leader moves up HMO reform.
33448,bartlet,He'll do that?
33449,leo,"We've talked to him. He's moved up HMO reform, there's nothing we can do about it,  and the welfare of your people comes first."
33450,leo,We save face and send a strong message.
33451,bartlet,"Anybody? Can I use this to get out of weddings and stuff?  Sam, the Majority  Leader's gonna move up HMO reform and my Duma's gonna vote on it, what do you think?"
33452,josh,"Sorry, sir, would you hear what Sam has to say for a moment?"
33453,bartlet,What?
33454,sam," Listen, I'd like to tell you about something and if, when  I'm done, you think I sounded like an idiot, just know that I'll be feeling like one as  well. Nikolai Ivanovich, the senior member of the logistical negotiating team, said he  had language he wanted added to the joint statement, and that he wrote it himself."
33455,leo,What's he getting involved with the language of the statement for?
33456,sam,"Yeah.  What he wanted added was, ""Together in partnership, we must stem  the tide of nuclear proliferation, for why should our two nations still possess the power  to destroy themselves ten times over; surely once is enough."" Now, I have to tell you,  sir, that both these negotiators had conversational English, but they didn't have idioms.  I promise you... "
33457,bartlet,"'Stem the tide"" is an English idiom."
33458,sam,"Yeah, and they don't have 'surely, once is enough' either."
33459,josh,"Sir, Chigorin wrote that."
33460,sam,"I think he's trying to send you a message, Mr. President."
33461,bartlet,He is trying to send me a message.
33462,bartlet," We've been trying to get non-proliferation on the agenda, we've been trying  to put those exact words in Chigorin's mouth."
33463,josh,He's got the whole Soviet defense establishment that's trying to do business.
33464,sam,"We're pretty impressed ourselves, Mr. Chairman."
33465,josh,"It's the old diplomatic corps, and he can't trust them yet, sir."
33466,bartlet,Fitz?
33467,bartlet,Let's go to Helsinki. But the reactor's first thing on the agenda. Anybody?
33468,leo,"Thank you, Mr. President."
33469,bartlet,"Thanks, everyone! Thank you. Thanks!"
33470,leo,I've got Jake Kimball in my office.
33471,bartlet,I'll be right in. Sam! 
33472,sam,"Yes, sir."
33473,bartlet,Nice job.
33474,sam,Thank you.
33475,bartlet,Tell me again why I can't wear whatever the hell I want?
33476,sam,"Well, that's not entirely true, sir: the earmuffs are optional."
33477,bartlet,I probably won't be wearing them.
33478,sam,"Yes, sir. "
33479,bartlet,"Whatever happened to Pong, huh? It was great, it was relaxing, it had that very  satisfying sound?"
33480,bartlet,"Yeah, me neither. Leo? "
33481,bartlet,No. Leo wanted to see if we could guarantee a loan.
33482,bartlet,"I appreciate that, and I can't give it to you, but I think I can do Leo one better."
33483,leo,What?
33484,bartlet,"We'll stay his biggest customer. When you announce your recall, you can announce you're  keeping your government contracts. Leo will work it out with Congress."
33485,bartlet,Talk to me about the 75 thousand workers.
33486,bartlet,"All right. Jakie, this is the White House, if we only screw up twice before breakfast,  it was a very good morning."
33487,bartlet,"One more thing: you can't make any more campaign contributions to me, or any Democrat.  You can vote, but that's it."
33488,bartlet,I knew I'd get screwed by a computer one day. 
33489,bartlet," For the hundredth time, it was an homage!"
33490,bartlet,Alan Tatum?
33491,bartlet,The White House owes you one picture.
33492,bartlet, Good to meet you!
33493,bartlet,"I'm sorry. I'm married to one. No, you meant that as a good thing! Let's go. "
33494,bartlet,"FDR was a fine president, don't get me wrong, but if you want something done right,  dammit, call New Hampshire! Come in, please."
33495,bartlet,"Are you retired, Mr. Tatum?"
33496,bartlet, Your grandfather was a furnace worker. Your father was on a railroad.  You couldn't find an honest work?
33497,bartlet,Charlie! 
33498,bartlet,"Where are you going? You got pictures, what do you I get?"
33499,bartlet,"You were there, you were at his feet, you got to tell me everything! Sit, we're going to  get some food.  You sit quietly over there and try to resist temptation to  bill me for something."
33500,c.j.,Hello.
33501,c.j.,Yeah.
33502,c.j.,"Aha. What branch of the Treasury Department, Agent Donovan?"
33503,c.j.,How does this work?
33504,c.j.,"Well, first of all, from how far away can you do this?"
33505,c.j.,What does that mean?
33506,c.j.,Okay.
33507,c.j.,You can't come in the Briefing Room.
33508,c.j.,This is what you meant by I am the boss?
33509,c.j.,"Well, I guess it's gonna have to be the little things now."
33510,sam,We are back.
33511,sam,It was.
33512,sam,I brought you a collector's plate of a moose racing through the woods.
33513,sam,I know how you do. Bonnie? You get a hat with a moose on it. 
33514,sam,I do.
33515,sam,They eat moose.
33516,sam,"No, I don't like eating things where the cartoon character can talk, and you know,  hatch a plan."
33517,sam,I'm gonna go to bed. I just came back for mail and messages.
33518,sam, What's this?
33519,sam,You don't know who sent it?
33520,sam,Think it's porn?
33521,sam,"Cause I'm pretty tired, but if it's porn, I mean, really good porn... By the way,  if my innocent joking's making you uncomfortable in any way..."
33522,c.j.,"NO! You understand? I'm driving myself home. You want to follow me in a chase car,  that's fine. But you have been annoying me for six days. You annoyed me here for three  days then you annoyed me in Finland. You're quiet, you're polite, and you're, you're  there. You're always there, I can't shake you. You followed me to Scandinavia and back. "
33523,c.j.,"Don't give me the ""aw shucks"" answer, ""Well that's my job, ma'am."" And don't call me  ""ma'am,"" don't call me ""ma'am,"" don't call me ""Ms. Cregg."" This isn't a western."
33524,c.j.,"Okay, okay, secret agent man, here's my rules and regulations. I'm getting in my baby  blue '65 Mustang convertible and I'm gonna feel the wind in my hair and any place else  I want. You can look at my taillights."
33525,c.j.,I will see you at home!
33526,c.j.,"There's no way you're letting me walk out the door, so what is it we're doing?"
33527,c.j.,What's your plan for me?
33528,c.j.,Are you gonna let me drive myself home?
33529,c.j.,You've got my spark plug?
33530,c.j.,Did you leave me anything?
33531,c.j.,Yeah.
33532,sam,"C.J., listen..."
33533,c.j.,Yeah?
33534,sam, This just came in the mail. It's an opposition spot.
33535,c.j.,What are you talking about?
33536,c.j.,Who sent you this?
33537,sam,That's the thing.
33538,c.j.,What?
33539,sam,I don't know.
33540,josh,Good morning.
33542,josh,Yes.
33544,josh,Just like I promised.
33546,josh,When did you find you missed me the most?
33548,josh,Of course.
33550,josh,I did.
33552,josh,It should be in my office.
33554,josh,Open it.
33556,josh,Moose. It's sauna-soaked moose meat. Nicely packaged in a burnt pine box. The hinges  are made from hand-woven Lapland ribbons.
33558,josh,Where am I supposed to be right now?
33560,c.j.,"No ""paid for by"" tagline."
33561,toby,We've looked at it three times now.
33562,toby,In May?
33563,c.j.,We didn't.
33564,toby,Do we make up a counter or do we keep it in a drawer?
33565,sam,"That's fine, but what about-"
33566,josh,I saw it last night. I'm gonna talk to Counsel's office.
33567,josh,If this was stolen I don't want Sam to end up like the girlfriend of an indicted Senator.
33568,c.j.,Do you have any reason to believe it was stolen?
33569,sam,No.
33570,c.j.,How can he be an accomplice to a crime he had no reason to believe occurred?
33571,josh,You wanna find out?
33572,c.j.,No.
33573,sam,We shouldn't go to the FBI yet.
33574,toby,"More than likely it's multi-jurisdictional, the thing probably crossed state lines."
33575,sam,"No, I'm saying we shouldn't go into law enforcement. It's gonna seem like we're trying  to suck the FBI into investigating Ritchie, and the FBI works for us."
33576,c.j.,He's got a point.
33577,sam,Plus we're all tainted.
33578,sam,No.
33579,josh,What are you suggesting?
33580,sam,I sit down with Kevin Kahn.
33581,josh,No.
33582,toby,No.
33583,sam,Bruno?
33584,sam,What do you think I sit down with Kevin Kahn?
33585,c.j.,Sam...
33586,sam,He's a friend of mine.
33587,sam,"What is the danger? What is the danger, where is the danger in my sitting down with Kevin  and saying someone sent this to us? If it's you, we've got our own in a drawer. If it's  someone, you've got a mole and we don't want anything to do with it. How do we lose,  in court, in public, in the voting booth?"
33588,sam,Would you talk to Leo?
33589,toby,I have a meeting.
33590,toby,They weren't that bad.
33591,c.j.,Good. Good. I accidentally ate a moose.
33592,toby,Morning.
33593,toby,"Listen, I've got an idea for a new kind of awards show, you should tell your entertainment  divisions about this. At the moment the winner's name is called the four nominees who  didn't win drop through a trap door right under their seats. Am I crazy, or is that not  pretty good television?"
33594,toby,"Yes, I've been asked by Bruno Gianelli to apologize for the skyboxes in Miami. We'll do  better at the Garden."
33595,toby,"We've got a better surrogate program this time. Governors, some of the big mayors,  some of us will be available to you, and some of us still have to staff the president."
33596,toby,Absolutely.
33597,toby,We have to?
33598,toby,And we have to call it programming?
33599,toby,The panels were a little dry last time.
33600,toby,"Monday night we've got real people. The president's met across the country reading  planks from the platform. Scott O'Leary's doing the keynote. The Harlem Boys' Choir  is singing the National Anthem. Tuesday is Mrs. Bartlet and Rev. Lydell. We've got a  panel with women senators on biomedical research, breast cancer breakthroughs, medical  privacy issues... Look, uh, a Dean Martin roast it ain't, but..."
33601,toby,You only covered two hours a night last time. How much more can you...?
33602,toby," You can't do an hour a night, that's just..."
33603,toby,One of these times you guys are going to come in here and say that and it's going to be true.
33604,leo,How long is it?
33605,bartlet,"Four or five hours, maybe, you'll be fine."
33606,leo,They do all the Henrys?
33607,bartlet,"They take all the Henrys. They do a thing, they call it War of the Roses. I'm told by  those who saw it in London it's spectacular. Catholic charities bought out a Broadway  theater. We're gonna go, we're gonna make some money."
33608,leo,Everything was fine except the part where we go.
33609,bartlet,You know why? Cause the Royal National Company's got all the King Henrys up there and  I'm still number one at the box office.
33610,leo,I love my job when you're like this.They have walked to the door of the Situation Room.
33611,bartlet,"Let me as you something, which Plantagenet do I most remind you of?"
33612,leo,"You want to, please? "
33613,bartlet,Good morning.
33614,bartlet,We just got done with Helsinki and the reactor.
33615,bartlet,How do we know?
33616,leo,Which are the most vulnerable?
33617,bartlet,General?
33618,bartlet,"So order it. I don't care if we know anything new or not, I need updates every half  hour for the next 48 hours."
33619,toby,"Look this is obviously a--do not eat the fruit--this is obviously a, a negotiating  position for you, so what is it you need? You want us to vote a member of the Rules  Committee out of the convention every night or something? The secretary should eat  a jellyfish? "
33620,c.j.,Morning.
33621,c.j.,That code name's not going anywhere is it?
33622,c.j.,I'm going shopping at lunch.
33623,c.j.,Does it matter?
33624,c.j.,I'm taking my niece Hogan shopping for a dress for her Junior Prom.
33625,c.j.,You're not gonna say that Hogan's a strange name for a girl?
33626,c.j.,My older brothers are golf crazies.
33627,c.j.,"Anything else, Agent Sunshine?"
33628,c.j.,Plus you're not my valet.
33629,c.j.,Bernie's on Connecticut at 12:30.
33630,c.j.,It's a Junior Prom.
33631,c.j.,Okay.
33632,c.j.,Hey.
33633,c.j.,"That was I strange thing I just did. I was telling him that I was taking Hogan shopping  for a Junior Prom dress, a few moments later he referred to the Prom and I made a point  of correcting him. Why would I do that, I felt so unnatural while I was saying it."
33634,c.j., I'd say that was ridiculous but I also referred to my older brothers.
33635,c.j.,Yeah but isn't that the kind of thing you do when you meet a guy and you're... 
33636,c.j.,"Never mind, it was obviously some kind of left-brain hip check, I'll take care of it."
33637,c.j.,"Yes, talk to me about them."
33638,josh,Hey Martha.
33639,josh,It's no problem.
33640,josh,Moose meat.
33641,josh,What're you talking about?
33642,josh,"I- yeah, I gave it to- "
33643,josh,"Nobody. Sorry, Martha, I'll, I'll take care of it."
33648,josh,Jojo.
33650,josh,Did you try the moose meat?
33652,josh,It's up to $180 on E-bay.
33654,josh,I... I... I don't understand; I don't need to tell you that you can't sell...
33656,josh,You did?
33658,josh,Who's the intern? 
33660,josh,Donna.
33662,josh,Fire the intern. 
33663,sam,Hey.
33665,sam,Yeah.
33666,sam,Kevin?
33667,sam,He just called?
33668,sam,Get him back.
33669,sam,Kevin.
33670,sam,Fine. 
33671,sam,You're just calling? 
33672,sam,You couldn't have called at a better time. One o'clock at Old Ebbitts?
33673,sam,Ginger?
33674,sam,I have a lunch.
33675,leo,To include what?
33676,leo,Holy Hell.
33677,leo,How could they possibly have the capability to strike a US base?
33678,leo,What would they be striking with?
33679,leo,"Why would they pick those two? There are a couple dozen bases on the seaboard that are  bigger than Dover and Fort Myer, why not in the Carolinas?"
33680,bartlet,"It's Henry V, three Henry VI, and Henry VIII. "
33681,bartlet,What does that mean? It sounds modern.
33682,bartlet,"Well, that doesn't sound bad."
33683,bartlet,Let me ask you something.
33684,bartlet,"If Shakespeare wrote a play about me, how many parts do you think it would be?"
33685,leo,Sir.
33686,bartlet,Think about it.
33687,leo,NSA has new cellular intercepts. The list of possible targets now includes Dover in  Delaware and Fort Myer in Maryland. And they're close to putting the White House on the list.
33688,bartlet,What are we doing?
33689,leo,Combat Air Patrols over DC and we've vectored aircraft away from the district.  Mr. President? I want you to start getting yourself into a mental place where you can  order an unidentified plane shot down. We're sealing a one-mile perimeter. Fitz is  about to call you and ask you to put the Coast Guard on alert for the Atlantic.
33690,bartlet,We're leaning on Arab Intelligence sources?
33691,leo,They're not what they used to be.
33692,bartlet,We're leaning on them?
33693,leo,Yes sir. We have to talk about the bunker.
33694,bartlet,I'm not going to the bunker.
33695,leo,Sir...
33696,bartlet,I'm not going to the bunker. It sends a terrible sign. I'm sitting in this room.
33697,leo,Ron and I have been through this.
33698,bartlet,You haven't been through it with me.
33699,leo,I'm trying to tell you if the time comes they're not going to give you a choice.
33700,bartlet,"You're telling me that the Secret Service, you're telling me my own bodyguards are  gonna escort me to the bunker?"
33701,leo,Your feet may touch the ground a couple of times along the way but I doubt it.
33702,c.j.,"I know you said you didn't want taffeta, but what do you think?"
33703,c.j.,It's a little pink.
33704,c.j.,Why?
33705,c.j.,"But I'm the cool aunt, this is what I do. Look at this.  Good gracious.  Black silk couture gown."
33706,c.j.,As luck would have it that's my height exactly.
33707,c.j.,Thank you. I'm just going to take this one too. 
33708,c.j.,What?
33709,c.j.,Is Simon bothering you?
33710,c.j.,"If he is, if he ever does, I want you to shriek at the top of your lungs, okay?"
33711,leo,Come on in.
33712,leo,What do you think?
33713,leo,Okay.
33714,leo,He took a semester of tap.
33715,leo,I don't know. I'll ask him.
33716,leo,"You may not get an answer today, okay? I don't want to give him too much knucklehead stuff."
33717,leo,What's with this tape?
33718,leo,What?
33719,sam,"No, I was just surprised you called."
33720,sam,I don't know.
33721,sam,I think it's a good idea.
33722,sam,My candidate's the President.
33723,sam,McKinley vs. Brian.
33724,sam,I'm sorry about the thing.
33725,sam,The open mike.
33726,sam,I think you are.
33727,sam,Really? 
33728,sam,"Look, something's happened, and I want to tell you about it."
33729,sam,Somebody made an attack ad and sent me a copy.
33730,sam,The President.
33731,sam,Yeah.
33732,sam, Yeah. 
33733,sam,"You've got a mole. We don't need it, we don't want it."
33735,josh,Hello.
33737,josh,I'll fire him.
33739,josh,Why.
33741,josh,And this is the White House not Williams-Sonoma.
33743,josh,He can't do it this way.
33745,josh,All right.
33747,josh,Yes.
33749,josh,Yes.
33751,josh,I said all right like five minutes ago.
33753,josh,Nicely done.
33755,josh,Excellent.
33756,toby,Really?
33757,toby,For four nights?
33758,toby,Okay.
33759,toby,How about corporate sponsorship?
33760,toby,Why are people footing the bill for this anyway?
33761,toby,It's better than four nights of professional wrestling.
33762,toby,I don't know. 
33763,toby,This is ridiculous.
33764,toby,I was in the room.
33765,toby,I was in the room.
33766,toby,There's--
33767,toby,Like what?
33768,toby,You want to help?
33769,toby, I was in the room.
33770,toby,Wait a second. How is it possible that these four people got together and decided something?  I mean how is it possible that they got together and agreed?
33771,toby,Bonnie?
33772,toby,Get me David Wolczek at the Justice Department.
33773,bartlet,Yeah.
33774,leo,The FBI says a Bahji communication was traced to Khaled Madani. Which is one of 11 AKA's  used by Abdul Al-Yossi.
33775,bartlet,This doesn't mean anything to me.
33776,bartlet,Where?
33777,leo,Bethesda.
33778,bartlet,Are we able to take a guess at where and when now?
33779,bartlet, What about Abdul Shareef? Isn't Shareef supposed to be helping us with intelligence  out of Qumar?
33780,leo,We should put the President on Marine One.
33781,bartlet,Thank you.
33782,bartlet,"I'm not going to the bunker. There are going to be people who aren't going to the bunker,  and when I get out I'm not going to be able to tell them what to do anymore and I like  doing that. Let's get Abby to New Hampshire but I'm not going to the bunker. And if you  say I have to I'm walking across the alley with the Chief Justice and I'm handing John  Hoynes my resignation. And as soon as he's sworn in I'm telling him to appoint me his  Vice President because I'm not going to the bunker. If the agent's come, the agents come  but tell Ron he'd better bring more than a couple of guys."
33794,c.j.,This. Sam's encouraging the President to sign the Clean Campaign pledge.
33795,c.j.,And they talk about the tape.
33796,c.j.,Yeah.
33797,toby,Yeah. You broadcast all four nights of the convention.
33798,toby,"'Cause the public owns the airwaves not you, and you have a legal obligation to the public."
33799,toby,You have an FCC public obligation.
33800,toby,I can't.
33801,toby,'Cause if you don't the Justice Department is going to investigate you for anti-trust violation.
33802,toby,A joint decision not to compete for the best convention programming.
33803,toby,"Not me so much as the Justice Department. 15 U.S.C. section 1. ""Every contract combination  or conspiracy in restraint of trade or commerce is declared to be illegal. Every person who  shall engage in any combination..."""
33804,toby,"Yes, no. There isn't going to be a horse race to cover, either in New York or San Diego,  but we gave you the air waves for free 70 years ago and 357 days a year you can say who's  up and who's down, who won the West and who lost the South but what's wrong with 8 days,  not every year but every 4 years, showing our leaders talking to us. Not a fraction of  what they said but what they said. And then th-the balloons."
33805,toby,You have to talk to the lawyers.
33806,toby,Talk to the lawyers.
33807,sam,About what?
33808,sam,He called me. It was out of the blue.
33809,sam,"We're good friends, he wanted to keep things civil."
33810,sam,What?
33811,sam,You're wrong.
33812,sam,I didn't...
33813,sam,I agree this is bad... and I take full responsibility.
33814,sam,"Oh, God."
33815,sam,I can't believe you did that.  I can't believe you did that!
33816,sam,What happened to...?
33817,sam,It was a mistake!
33818,sam,You said you laughed!
33819,sam,You said...
33820,sam,So that's what this is about? The open... that's what this is about!
33821,sam,Yeah?
33822,sam,I think it will too.
33823,bartlet,You can send him in.
33824,leo,They arrested him.
33825,bartlet,"Oakland, California."
33826,bartlet,What did they find on board?
33827,bartlet,What was the target?
33828,leo,Fort Point.
33829,bartlet,That wasn't on the list.
33830,bartlet,So why'd they want it.
33831,leo,Because of what's above it.
33832,bartlet,The Golden Gate Bridge.
33833,bartlet,This was on the west coast and we didn't know anything.
33834,leo,We knew enough.
33835,bartlet,I'm going to ask this again. Where the hell was Shareef?
33836,bartlet,What do you mean?
33837,bartlet,Yeah.
33838,bartlet,Yeah.
33839,bartlet,To who ?
33840,bartlet,Are you telling me the Qumari defence minister may have ordered an attack on the  Golden Gate Bridge?
33841,bartlet,We have a diplomatic relationship with this country.
33842,bartlet,"He's coming here. Shareef is coming here, in like, ten days, isn't he?"
33843,bartlet,Get ready to say.
33844,bartlet,Thank you.
33845,c.j.,Hey Jamie. Could you give us just a second?
33846,c.j., Come here. 
33847,c.j.,What were you and Hogan talking about that you would tell me later?
33848,c.j.,Oh. I didn't know that.
33849,c.j.,Thank you. 
33850,c.j.,"I just said ""thank you""."
33851,c.j.,"Well, I should get going."
33852,c.j.,Good night.
33853,leo,He’s got to put everything in a blind trust when he’s elected. The Qumari Defense Minister  gets to own a bank? 
33854,leo,It was Shareef who had three suspects arrested in that case? 
33855,leo,So we couldn’t question them? 
33856,bartlet, You haven’t got it. 
33857,bartlet,We want to ask the Justice Department to indict Qumari Minister of Defense. We’re saying  he’s a terror kingpin. We’re saying he’s killed I don’t know how many civilians and how  many of Tommy’s Marines. We’re saying he’s compromised I don’t know how many agents  throughout the world and we’re saying he’s done it in the clothing of an ally. This isn’t  a cave dweller. This is Capone. You haven’t got it. 
33858,josh," I don’t know, it’s confusing. There’s Van Morrison. She’s doing a scene from  “Flashdance.” "
33859,josh,You sure? 
33861,josh,"Listen, I’m sending you to Bismarck, okay? You got to go tomorrow and sit in on a DNC  platform meeting where they’re discussing whether or not... "
33863,josh,Yeah. 
33865,josh,It’s just overnight. 
33868,josh," I wouldn’t go that far, you’re speaking for the White House.  The DNC’s having a platform meeting and North Dakota wants to have a plank eliminating  the word ‘north’ from their name. We take no state for granted; we want to show North  Dakota we care and so the White House is going to be represented... "
33870,josh, It’s really the very most we’re willing to do. I’ll write a  statement and you’ll read it. 
33873,josh,Pintero? 
33875,josh,I forgot I had that meeting. 
33877,josh,"The Iditarod, Donna. They have an airport; it’s the capital. "
33879,josh,As soon as I get dressed. 
33881,josh,Buttercup? You getting enough iron in your diet? You getting too much? 
33882,josh,Quite a bit of Sunday with your man. 
33883,josh,I have to meet with Rick Pintero. We set it up yesterday. It’s about reauthorization  of the Welfare Reform Bill.  
33884,josh,And I’m pretty broken up about that. But this is right in your wheelhouse. Poor women  are counting on me. 
33885,josh,I bought your birthday present already.  
33886,josh,Nobody really knows.  
33887,sam,Hey. 
33888,sam,Yeah. 
33889,sam,Fine. 
33890,sam,I screwed up; I moved on. 
33891,sam,What? 
33892,sam,Save the Everglades. 
33893,sam,What’s the plan? 
33894,sam,Eight billion? 
33895,sam,No sweat. 
33896,sam,Where? 
33897,sam,"Yeah. No. I’m not taking it to Bruno, but thanks for coming in. "
33898,sam, I’m sorry? 
33899,sam, Because I like my job. 
33900,sam,Sugar growers are Ritchie’s biggest supporters. It’ll look like we’re taxing our enemies.  It’ll backfire.  
33901,josh,Congressman! 
33902,josh,"I’m sorry, I had in my head that we were doing this in your office. "
33903,josh,My assistant set me straight. Come on back. 
33906,josh,It’s a city. You’ve been there. 
33908,josh,Ah... I just... we’ve been scheduled for a while to go to a Catholic charity’s fundraiser  in New York next week. It’s the Royal National Company... 
33909,josh," And it’s great, but I’ve just been told Governor Ritchie is coming as well,  so now it becomes a different thing, and... "
33910,josh, Yeah. But what do you got? 
33911,josh,How? 
33912,josh,We can’t cave on childcare. 
33913,josh,A billion? 
33914,josh,What? 
33915,josh," Well, the work requirement aside, the marriage incentives... "
33916,josh,Marriage incentives are terrible! 
33917,josh," All right, let me talk about it around here. "
33918,josh,"Yeah, I’m really looking forward to it. Thanks."
33919,leo,“I will do it again.” Thanks. 
33920,bartlet," I’ve been seeing a shrink, by the way. I had trouble sleeping and Leo  brought in a guy. I feel ridiculous talking out loud like this, but he said... Doesn’t  matter. I just can’t believe it’s been a year. Anyway. "
33921,bartlet,What is it? 
33922,leo,It can wait until we get back. 
33923,bartlet,What is it? 
33924,leo,This isn’t the place. 
33925,bartlet,Leo. 
33926,leo,Shareef had a meeting with two Muslim clerics in Bechar. We picked up the meeting by  aiming and IR laser beam at the windows from 400 feet. Three different Arabic experts  worked on the translation.  
33927,bartlet,“The enemy imagines he is secure. The bridge did not fall. He looks down from  his high-- or elevated place or places-- but our great victory is still assured.  There will be other moments. 
33928,leo,"Meaning times, places, or opportunities. "
33929,bartlet,"“I have brought him low, and I will do it again.”  All right. "
33930,toby,"They can't be in the same room. It elevates him, it diminishes us."
33931,c.j.,Yes.
33932,toby,Now he's one of two guys tossing a job application.
33933,c.j.,And it gives him access to a massive press corps.
33934,josh,"How do we get out? We'll look impolite, and we'll look chicken."
33935,josh,"We'll tell him the shows not very good, we don't think he's going to like it."
33936,c.j.,"Yes, yes, that's what we do."
33937,josh,"We don't go, we pull out. Better to look chicken, then to get broasted, my mother always says."
33938,sam,What's broasted?
33939,josh,I've never really known but it's what they do to chickens.
33940,toby,What do you think?
33941,sam,I don't know.
33942,toby,"You think we don't go, right?"
33943,sam,Yeah.
33944,toby,"All right, we don't go. The President's going to have to call the Archbishop."
33945,c.j.,I was looking forward to it.
33946,toby,What?
33947,c.j.,The show.
33948,josh,It's five hours of King Henry's with musical interludes and a dinner break.
33949,c.j.,I think you should come to my house and perform it for me.
33950,toby,We're done.
33951,toby,Sam...
33952,sam,Yeah?
33953,toby,I talked to Jane and Muriel this morning and they said they came to you yesterday with  something about the Everglades and you shut the door.
33954,sam,Yeah.
33955,toby,They seemed pretty excited about it. You sure you don't want it?
33956,sam,You can look it over.
33957,toby,"No, if you say so."
33958,sam,Okay.
33959,bartlet,This is ridiculous. He's coming here. He's coming here! Why the hell can't we arrest him  when he steps off the plane?
33960,bartlet,Fitz makes a reasonable point. Doesn't it pretty much go without saying that I revoked  it after he tried to blow up the Golden Gate Bridge?
33961,leo,We can't do that.
33962,bartlet,Why the hell do we need...? He's coming here on his own. He's delivering himself on  a Lear jet.
33963,leo,"We can't talk to the Sultan David, Shareef is a member of the royal family. The Sultan's  his brother. We want to lock him up. I don't think he's going to warm to it. Plus we're  never going to see Shareef again."
33964,leo,"That's fine. It doesn't matter what they historically rejected. Shareef is coming here.  Have an answer for us by tomorrow, okay?"
33965,bartlet,"Fellas, this guy is going to stand trial in a US court and if we have to stick heroin on  his plane to get him there, that's what we're going to do. "
33966,c.j.,Agent 99.
33967,c.j.,"I want you to tell me right now, this second, what are you people doing to catch this guy?"
33968,c.j.,"You know, I haven't been happy with any of your answers to any of my questions."
33969,c.j.,Simon...
33970,c.j.,He's been reading my e-mail?
33971,c.j.,He knew I was shopping?
33972,c.j.,How do you know?
33973,c.j.,I don't want to know about this.
33974,c.j.,You just did.
33975,c.j.,So the one time you answer a question of mine...
33976,c.j.,What?
33977,c.j.,"I thought you said you want to have ""gin"" tonight."
33978,c.j.,I can't go to my gym tonight. My gym's flooded.
33979,c.j.,It closes at 7:00.
33980,c.j.,Is it a good gym?
33981,c.j.,You don't have to get snobby about it.
33982,c.j.,"Yes, thank you."
33983,bartlet,It should be a showcase. He should have the best lawyers in the world.
33984,leo,We got to make sure he lands at Dulles and not BWI.
33985,bartlet,Why?
33986,leo,'Cause that's the court that'll have jurisdiction.
33987,bartlet,The law cracks me up.
33988,leo,I know.
33989,bartlet,What else?
33990,leo,Josh met with Rick Pintero yesterday on the Working Toward Independence Act.
33991,bartlet,You suppose that could be any more patronizingly named?
33992,leo,"I think when we're talking welfare, that ships pretty much sailed."
33993,bartlet,What do they want me to eat?
33994,leo,300 million for marriage incentives.
33995,bartlet,"Ah, the marriage incentives. What a bunch of horse manure."
33996,leo,I agree.
33997,bartlet,Is marriage really something that should be incentivised? And where the hell are all  the small government conservatives when we're talking about Washington getting into the  yenta business?
33998,leo,Yes.
33999,bartlet,You think we should do it?
34000,leo,Let's swallow the pill. Our own caucus won't discuss it and it does more good then harm.
34001,bartlet,Marriage incentives. Used to be all you had to have was a decent dental practice.
34002,leo,"I don't understand. You didn't grow up in the Catskills, yet..."
34003,bartlet,I'm erudite.
34004,leo,Yes.
34005,bartlet,Lets do it.
34006,leo,"Thank you, Mr. President."
34007,bartlet,Charlie.
34008,bartlet,I appreciated you coming out to the cemetery with me yesterday.
34009,bartlet,"So it's been a year. Why don't you organize the search, you know for a new Executive Secretary."
34010,bartlet,I may not like the first couple of candidates. It may take a while.
34011,bartlet,Thank you.
34016,josh,Hey.  Something smells great.
34017,josh,It's ready? We can eat it?
34018,josh,The beef is well done?
34019,josh,The peas?
34020,josh,Carrots?
34021,josh,Potatoes?
34022,josh,Gravy?
34023,josh,"Oh, this is going to be a good night. My woman, a fine stew, and a Mets game on national TV.  You see how I slipped that last one in?"
34024,josh,You listening to Van Morrison again?
34025,josh,"Well... uh, good."
34026,josh,"Yeah, in fact we're getting another billion for childcare."
34027,josh,300 million for marriage incentives.
34028,josh,"No, the marriage incentives are a serious..."
34029,josh,Let's not do this now.
34030,josh,"You know what? Every single study, every one shows that kids do better in two-parent houses."
34031,josh,It's not my solution.
34032,josh,"Amy, if we don't get elected, I promise you, President Ritchie is going to have a lot  less sympathy for your agenda."
34033,josh,Yes it is. It's locked up. I have the American Children’s Alliance behind it.
34034,josh,And we're back to work.
34035,josh,"Yeah, it's Josh. The Secretary of Labor is in Chicago..."
34044,c.j.,You guys have a shooting range here?
34045,c.j.,Good.
34046,c.j., Let me try one of those.
34047,c.j.,A gun.
34048,c.j.,"Yeah, let me see what all the fuss is about."
34049,c.j.,Yeah.
34050,c.j.,"Well, I haven't shot one as much as I've seen others shot one in the movies."
34051,c.j.,You guys use bull's-eyes?
34052,c.j.,I thought you'd use those little outlines of people.
34053,c.j.,'Cause I'm thinking if someone's coming or you they probably don't have a bulls-eye on them.
34054,c.j.,Tough talk. I like that. Give me your gun.
34055,c.j.,What's wrong with yours?
34056,c.j.,I've heard of that. That's a good brand.
34057,c.j.,Let's go. I'm feeling twitchy.
34058,c.j.,This is cool.
34059,c.j.,I don't need training wheels.
34060,c.j.,That thing practically broke my arm. I've been wrong about guns. Just hand these out  to the criminals.
34061,c.j.,What do you got?
34062,c.j.,Marksmanship-wise?
34063,c.j.,"Show me what you've got. I'll tell you what. I'll make it interesting for you. Get five  bullets. If you can't land any in the middle, then I get to drive my car."
34064,c.j.,"Come on. One dead center, I never bother you about it again."
34065,c.j.,Okay.
34066,c.j.,What?
34067,c.j.,Something nice to you?
34068,c.j.,Okay.
34069,c.j.,Wait. That was a trick. You must know you can do it. Put three in the middle.
34070,c.j.,Three out of five. You want to back out?
34071,c.j.,"Look, if you want to back out..."
34072,c.j.,Wow. That's what I call dead center. What happen to the other two bullets?
34073,c.j.,"There were five bullets, and I don't believe it."
34074,c.j.,How do you shoot like that?
34075,c.j.,I don't believe it.
34076,c.j.,Yes. Yes. I like that you're tall.
34077,c.j.,It makes me feel more feminine. I'm going to go change.
34078,sam,Come in.
34079,sam,Hi.
34080,sam,What do you need?
34081,sam,That's good.
34082,sam,You'll find somebody.
34083,sam,Fine.
34084,sam,Yeah.
34085,josh,Hey.
34086,leo,We spent millions of dollars developing a pen for the astronauts that would work in zero  gravity. Know what the Russians did?
34087,toby,Used a pencil?
34088,leo,They used a pencil. What do you need?
34089,josh,We're actually here separately. This is a coincidence.
34090,leo,Okay.
34091,josh,We have to move faster on the welfare bill.
34092,leo,Yesterday you told me we were fine.
34093,josh,"We are fine, but the women's groups will have their day in the sun."
34094,leo,Women's groups?
34095,josh,One particular women's group for sure.
34096,leo,Josh is there nothing you can do to tame that woman?
34097,josh,Hey...
34098,leo,How scared should I be?
34099,josh,Not at all. I'm just saying...
34100,leo,It's going to be fine?
34101,josh,Yeah.
34102,leo,'Cause it's a body blow if we lose the floor vote.
34103,josh,We're not going to lose the floor vote.
34104,leo,You?
34105,toby,The President needs to call the Archbishop and tell him we can't be at the fund-raiser.
34106,leo,I know.
34107,toby,He needs a reason.
34108,leo,We can use the same thing we were going to use with Chigorin to get out of Helsinki.
34109,josh,"That's exactly what we do. No, it takes care... We get the leadership to schedule the  welfare vote for next week on the day we're supposed to be in New York. We can't go  'cause we got to work the vote and the early vote gives Amy no time to mobilize."
34110,leo,Done.
34111,josh,This is good.
34112,leo,"Toby, an encouraging word from you to Sam wouldn't be totally out of line."
34113,toby,Sam doesn't need to be patronized. He'll shake it off.
34114,leo,It'd make him feel better.
34115,toby,I don't want him feeling better. I want him feeling mad. Is there anyone you'd rather have  as a blood enemy less then Sam? That's how I want him.
34116,leo," You know, it was a screw up, but I got to say I love the way he did it--  full speed, bam. Like there's a Sam Seaborn-shaped hole in the wall."
34117,bartlet, They've got something for us.
34118,leo,Excuse me.
34119,bartlet,Did we solve immunity?
34120,bartlet,Did we solve it?
34121,bartlet,Why?
34122,bartlet,Yeah.
34123,bartlet,He was tortured?
34124,bartlet,"Well, I'm no lawyer, but I'm pretty sure that's inadmissible."
34125,bartlet,"We'll come up with a less aggressive way of... We'll cancel his trip here obviously,  but we'll come up with something. That's the ball game."
34126,leo,This is always when you say something.
34127,leo,I like to look good for you.
34128,leo,No.
34129,leo,"Look, international law has always recognized certain protected person's who you couldn't  attack. It's been this way since the Romans."
34130,leo,Yes.
34131,leo,Yeah.
34132,leo,I don't like where this conversation's going.
34133,leo,"In the Situation Room, Fitz?"
34134,leo,We declared war.
34135,leo,And the plot to kill Hitler was an internal rebellion.
34136,leo,I'm going to get back to the office.
34138,josh,They're getting telegrams two to one against. I just met with two Congressmen. Amy got in  going in 24 hours.
34140,josh,Yeah. I'm not talking about just a couple either.
34143,sam,"Hey. You just got back from someplace, right?"
34145,sam,"Just from the state, right?"
34147,sam,Yeah.
34149,sam,Yes.
34151,sam,I am up off the dirt.
34153,sam,I am.
34155,sam,"Actually, I'm crashing a deadline."
34156,sam,My spirits are up.
34157,sam,really?
34158,toby,Excuse me.
34160,toby,Can I get the room for a minute?
34161,sam,Will do.
34162,toby,"The first election I ever worked, you know was Bronx Borough President. There was some  questions about my guys tax returns, so we called a press conference. It was 104 degrees  that day on Bronx Boulevard. And I thought with a tax thing, the shorter the better, so  I turned off the air-conditioning."
34163,sam,Did the press end it fast?
34164,toby,Not the press so much as the candidate fainted.
34165,sam,"Well, you changed the story."
34166,toby,"Yeah. I don't even think I ended up voting for him. Now, you screw up was worse and on a  much bigger stage."
34167,sam,I'm fine.
34168,toby,Yeah. 'Cause this is no time for the starters to be on the bench.
34169,sam,Yeah.
34170,toby,All right. 
34171,toby,"I read the Everglades pitch from Muriel and Jane. You're right, it's probably a pass."
34172,sam,"No, that's the memo I'm writing now; I don't think so."
34173,toby,I think anything tactical makes us look bad.
34174,sam,"Well, we should get used to it. We go on TV, we do a better job at selling it then the  other guy. And we win the bigger argument which is Ritchie is with Florida's special  interests. And we do it right, we've forced him into defending polluters. I think Jane  and Muriel are right. I also think it's the right thing to do. Ginger?"
34175,sam,I'm printing this now. You'll get it out?
34176,toby,All right.
34177,sam,"Thanks, though."
34178,toby,Sam?
34179,sam,Yeah?
34180,toby,"You're still mad, right?"
34181,josh,Yes.
34182,josh,It's unknown. That's why it's called an X-factor.
34183,josh,An intangible...
34184,josh,Hmm?
34185,bartlet,"Josh, what the hell did you do to this welfare vote?"
34186,josh,"Well, we scheduled it for Wednesday night."
34187,bartlet,Why?
34188,josh,"Two reasons, sir. The first was to get you out of the Catholic Charities event in New York."
34189,bartlet,I'm going to that.
34190,josh,Governor Ritchie's accepted an invitation.
34191,bartlet,I know.
34192,bartlet,The fund-raiser was my idea. I've known the Archbishop for 20 years and I'm not playing  politics with the church. Did anyone want to ask me abut this? You've got me running the  vote from the mezzanine floor of a Broadway theatre. Where are we in the vote?
34193,josh,"Well, to be honest, we're slipping a little bit."
34194,bartlet,We are?
34195,josh,"Yes, sir."
34196,bartlet,Why?
34197,josh,The women's groups are raising...
34198,bartlet," True or false, Josh: My life would be better right now if you and your  girlfriend swapped jobs? Why is it for every good thing you do around here, we've got  to endure three screwiest."
34199,josh,"Well, I'm sorry about the..."
34200,bartlet,Sorry doesn't get me 218. It doesn't get back the ad that slipped through your office  any more then it gets back tobacco which you gave away for lunch money. And why the hell  don't you know what Ritchie's commitments are before you get anywhere near my schedule?  I've got the Presidential Box at a cattle call. Win the damn vote.
34201,josh,"Yes, sir."
34202,bartlet,I've got a G-8 briefing.
34203,josh,"Thank you, Mr. President."
34204,c.j.,That was a fun party. I'd wish you'd come inside.
34205,c.j.,It's two blocks.
34206,c.j.,"You're not big on fun, are you?"
34207,c.j.,Yeah.
34208,c.j.,Walking on the wrong side of you.
34209,c.j., We couldn't just be two people who are walking home at the end of the night?
34210,c.j.,You know you told me a few days ago that you were at Rosslyn and I never said anything.  I should have said something.
34211,c.j.,"What was your, um, what was your job right then?"
34212,c.j.,I guess I figured.
34213,c.j.,Which one was Beckwith? I get them mixed up.
34214,c.j.,Did you hit him?
34215,c.j.,I just like your smile is all. I wouldn't mind seeing it more.
34216,c.j.,"No, yeah, no..."
34217,c.j.,"I was just, you're right, 'cause walking in these heels..."
34218,c.j.,Aren't you supposed to be walking in front of me?
34219,c.j.,We feel free to take chances.
34220,c.j.,"Forget it, I'm home."
34221,c.j.,Can we drop it?
34222,c.j.,"I say can we drop it, you say sure and then we don't drop it."
34223,c.j.,Yes.
34224,josh,It's got to costing you an awful lot of PAC money.
34225,josh,It's after midnight; they wouldn't let me up.
34226,josh,"Yes, you are. You know for every vote on the left you grab, I got to get one on the right.  You know what that does to the bill?"
34227,josh,I've seen you level hotel ballrooms screaming about how ridiculous abstinence is.
34228,josh,"Amy, when these things are over and we win, you know who's job it is to pay a visit to  the people who weren't with us?"
34229,josh,Nothing.
34230,josh,I'm saying that just 'cause you have Sherry Lansing's platinum card doesn't mean you  go toe-to toe with the people...
34231,josh,...who are writing the federal budget when they need you.
34232,josh,There's a bigger picture. There's an election in November and you are a player in a  political party.
34233,josh,All right.
34234,josh,I have to go back to the office. 
34235,josh,Yeah.
34236,leo,Mr. President.
34237,bartlet,What are you doing here? It's 1:00 in the morning.
34238,leo,I called over to the residence. They said you were in the office.
34239,bartlet,You were home?
34240,leo,"Yeah. By the way, I signed off on canceling the trip. I signed off on setting their vote."
34241,bartlet,You came over here to stand in front of Josh?
34242,leo,No. It's almost 8:00 AM in Qumar. You shouldn't cancel the trip. You should tell me to call  the State Department.
34243,bartlet,Why?
34244,leo,What are the alternatives?
34245,bartlet,What are you...
34246,leo,What are the alternatives? Are we going to attack Qumar?
34247,bartlet,Maybe.
34248,leo,"Now? We could kill all the armed teenagers we want, we still won't have Shareef. Let's  get some more intelligence, let's some more counsel."
34249,bartlet,More counsel is going to help me violate international law.
34250,leo,It's pretty easy to say this is a war scenario.
34251,bartlet,It's pretty easy to say anything is a war scenario.
34252,leo,This is...
34253,bartlet,The war on poverty. It's a slippery slope.
34254,leo,Stop it.
34255,bartlet,What?
34256,leo,Just stop it already. This is the most horrifying part of your liberalism. You think  there are moral absolutes.
34257,bartlet,There are moral absolutes.
34258,leo,"Apparently not. He's killed innocent people. He'll kill more, so we have to end him.  The village idiot comes to that conclusion before the Nobel Laureate."
34259,bartlet,Il Principe has justified every act of oppression...
34260,leo,This is justified. This is required.
34261,bartlet,Says who?
34262,leo,"Says me, Mr. President. You want to go ask some more people, they'll say so, too."
34263,bartlet,"Well, a mob mentality is just..."
34264,leo,Not a mob. Just you. Right now. This decision. Which by the way is one of self-defense.  Let Shareef come here and we have options. Cancel the trip and we have none. That's all  we're talking about right now.
34265,bartlet,There are moral absolutes. Make the call.
34266,leo,"Thank you, Mr. President. "
34267,c.j.,"We're leaving exactly one hour later than we planned. At 5:00, he'll board Marine One for  the trip to Andrews, where he'll board Air Force One for the trip to New York. We're just  trying to be helpful because we understand that a Presidential motorcade rolling through  midtown Manhattan around 6:00, 6:30 really helps keep things well-lubed out there. As a  matter of fact, we apologize to New Yorkers for the inconvenience, but the delay was  inevitable."
34268,c.j.,I meant to say 'unavoidable.' The delay was unavoidable. The President will make a short  visit at City Hall and be in his feet at 7:30.
34269,c.j.,The play is 19 hours long.
34270,c.j.,It's long. It's five and a half hours.
34271,c.j.,On the welfare bill?
34272,c.j.,"Yeah, there's movement. It's close."
34273,c.j.,Look at the color of Josh Lyman's hair.
34274,c.j.,I'd go beyond that. I'd say the future of the entire world depends on it.
34275,c.j.,"I don't want to scare anybody, but I'd call your Congressman. Mark?"
34276,c.j.,The President and Governor Ritchie?
34277,c.j.,I don't know.
34278,c.j.,Anything else? I'll see you in New York.
34279,c.j.,I'm sorry?
34280,c.j.,He scheduled a last-minute meeting.
34281,c.j.,Good question.
34282,c.j.,Qumari Defense Minister Abdul Shareef.
34283,leo,Where'd we get the wires crossed? How'd the Pentagon put it on the schedule?
34284,leo,He's meeting with the guy. He's gonna be in the Oval Office.
34285,leo,It wasn't cancelled?
34286,leo,Fitz...
34287,leo,"I don't want the President... All right. I was gonna say I don't want him putting a voice  to the guy. I take my daughter to a seafood place, the first thing she does is name all  the lobsters in the tank, so I can't eat them."
34288,bartlet,Hello.
34289,leo,"Good morning, sir."
34290,bartlet,There are rules for these things?
34291,bartlet,Doesn't the law also require that I not assassinate someone?
34292,bartlet,I know. One of them was mine.
34293,leo,"The E.O. is law, but it was made up by the Executive, and the Executive can ignore it."
34294,bartlet,Assume for a second I say yes. How do we do it? Fitz walks up to him with a gun?
34295,bartlet,Why?
34296,bartlet,The things we choose to care about.
34297,bartlet,"If it can't happen here, then why'd we care that Shareef was delivering himself?"
34298,bartlet,The British say yes?
34299,bartlet,How many over there know about this?
34300,bartlet,And some people in Bermuda?
34301,leo," This is as big as the club gets, all right?"
34302,bartlet," Okay. Well... surely, this is the most absurd meeting I ever sat in, and  friends, that is saying something."
34303,bartlet,"Yeah, I imagine."
34304,bartlet,What does the pen do? Squirts poison?
34305,bartlet,We give him it boxed. Tell them to put it in a box.
34306,josh,"Just coffee, thanks."
34307,josh,That doesn't give you cancer?
34308,josh,Yeah.
34309,josh,Welfare is a core issue with swing and independent voters. They use it as a barometer to  measure a President's values on work and responsibility.
34310,josh,We're gonna win the vote.
34311,josh,We will... but we're gonna. I have a nine-point margin.
34312,josh,They're on that fence?
34313,josh,You understand we have to authorize welfare one way or another. You got to do it every  six years.
34314,josh,Amy...
34315,josh,You have an extra billion in child care.
34316,josh,"We don't like the marriage incentives, either. Don't be ridiculous, but independent  voters..."
34317,josh,"Call off the hunt, and I'll see to it that you guys can make up with The White House."
34318,josh,'Cause we're gonna win.
34319,c.j.,Good morning.
34320,c.j.,I thought you weren't on 'til this afternoon.
34321,c.j.,Hey. 
34322,c.j.,"Sure, it is.  You should be like that."
34323,c.j.,Could you set this gentleman up with a keychain?
34324,c.j.,"It'll have the Seal of the President on it, and President Bartlet's signature, and you  can tell your mom that you can't buy this in a souvenir shop. In fact, you can't buy it  anywhere 'cause it's against the law to sell the Seal of the President. You can only get  it here."
34325,c.j.,"If the cops stopped you, they're gonna think you're an important person."
34326,c.j.,Nice meeting you.
34327,c.j.,Is he your nephew?
34328,c.j.,Are you good at it?
34329,c.j.,Listen. I was thinking there's really no reason for you to make the trip to New York.
34330,c.j.,I'm gonna be traveling with the President the whole time.
34331,c.j.,Sure.
34332,c.j.,Who's trying to date you?
34333,c.j.,Who's trying to kiss you?
34334,c.j.,"No, I didn't."
34335,c.j.,Aren't you not allowed to call a protectee by their first name?
34336,c.j.,There's really no reason for you to come to New York.
34337,bartlet,"It's ""The War of the Roses."" All the Henrys, and all the Richards, for that matter."
34338,bartlet,Yeah.
34339,bartlet,Yeah. There's also singing.
34340,bartlet,"No, but they're gonna sing from time to time, and one of the songs is a song I love.  I can't think of the name now, but it's an Edwardian... It always reminds me... It makes  me think of college, like, I don't know, like they should be singing it in the dining  hall at Christ College at Cambridge. The chorus is, ""And victorious in war shall be made  glorious in peace."" I was just singing it this morning."
34341,bartlet,"Good. Yeah. Let me ask you something. Is there a crime, which if it wasn't illegal, you  would do?"
34342,bartlet,"Right, but you wouldn't rob a bank?"
34343,bartlet,"Connecticut had a law prohibiting the use of contraceptives. It was written out of rage  against adultery. But in the age of AIDS, don't Connecticut residents do more for the  general welfare by flagrantly breaking the law?"
34344,bartlet,Yeah.
34345,bartlet,Stanley...
34346,bartlet,I can't tell you.
34347,bartlet,"No, I really can't. It's high security. To say nothing of... "
34348,bartlet,"If I tell you I intend to commit a crime, you're required by law to report it.  I'm gonna go. It's good seeing you."
34349,sam,You co-sponsored the bill.
34350,sam,I don't even understand that.
34351,toby,"I don't think the congressman is here as a co-sponsor of the bill, Sam. I think he's here  as the leader of Florida's Republican Delegation."
34352,sam,That's not gonna happen
34353,sam,Walk in the door together?
34354,toby,"It's a Catholic fundraiser, Ted. It's not a network debate."
34355,sam,We get the votes... if the President meets with Ritchie?
34356,toby,"Ted, the President enters the room with his wife and the President of China. He doesn't  do it with the governor of Florida."
34357,josh,It was a scheduling error.
34358,josh,Nonetheless...
34359,josh,I know.
34360,josh,We can help you raise money.
34361,josh,"Look, there's a billion more for child care. This isn't a bad bill. We're fixing ten  things..."
34362,josh,...that were wrong with welfare. Transportation subsidies...
34363,josh," All right. These are three 'no' votes, right?"
34364,josh, Okay. The President's gonna call you.
34365,josh, No. Sometime during the first intermission.
34366,bartlet, Who are these men?
34367,bartlet,Okay.
34368,bartlet,"Yeah, I'm feeling particularly proud of that today."
34369,bartlet,"We're happy you visited us, Mr. Defense Minister. You're welcome here anytime, and please,  send the best regards of the President of the United States to the Royal Sultan."
34370,bartlet,Not in the Oval Office.
34371,bartlet,Tell him I have a rash on my hand. Make sure you apologize.
34372,bartlet,Yeah.  Thanks.
34373,bartlet,It's a hand-carved incense burner. Gypsum and sandalwood.
34374,sam,What's up?
34375,toby,"A.P. called with a quote from Kevin Kahn.  ""Governor Ritchie is looking  forward to meeting with the President tonight so he could talk about the Federal Government's  plan for the Everglades, which would tax sugar farmers into unemployment."""
34376,sam,It wouldn't.
34377,toby,"Yeah, but now he's got another ""What's Bartlet hiding from us today?"" spot."
34378,sam,"What about this? Call A.P. and tell them that Governor Ritchie is mistaken and that he is not  on the President's schedule, and go further. Say the President would love to meet with Ritchie,  but he's gonna be busy tonight passing a vote..."
34379,toby,...that's being hung up by the Florida delegation.
34380,toby,Josh?
34381,josh, Yeah?
34382,toby,"In response to a tactical leak from Kevin Kahn, I'm gonna let A.P. know that Florida's messing  with the welfare vote. You all right with that?"
34383,josh,Yeah.
34384,toby,I'm asking 'cause if we lose the vote then we've just said that he's the one that brought  us down.
34385,josh,Yeah.
34386,toby,You all right with this?
34387,josh,Yeah.
34388,bartlet,It's Fiderer?
34389,bartlet," I saw your resume, so we don't need to talk about that. What have you  been doing recently?"
34390,bartlet,Like the sweaters?
34391,bartlet,Uh-huh. And before that?
34392,bartlet,You're a professional gambler.
34393,bartlet,Whereabouts?
34394,bartlet,Okay. Why did you leave the White House?
34395,bartlet,Charlie!
34396,bartlet,Can I have a minute?
34397,bartlet, Would you mind waiting outside just a moment?
34398,bartlet," Is this a joke? If it's a joke, it's both funny and well-executed, but I think  you and I both know that it's not. I send you out to replace Delores Landingham, and that's  what you came home with?"
34399,bartlet,She was an alpaca farmer who needed two tries to get her own name.
34400,bartlet,Don't worry about it. I'm gonna get the Personnel Office on it. I got to go change for  New York.
34401,leo,Good afternoon.
34402,leo,"After being presented with overwhelming evidence, provided by foreign and domestic  intelligence agencies, the President requested the intelligence finding you have in your  hands right now. That finding has been prepared and signed off by the directors of the  NSA and Central Intelligence."
34403,leo,The President's rescinding his own Executive Order.
34404,leo,The FBI's role is investigatory. They're not allowed to engage in a police action.
34405,leo, I don't know.
34406,leo,At the last possible minute. Consider yourselves notified. Thank you. I have theater tickets.
34407,c.j.,How you guys doing?
34408,c.j.,Just about.
34409,c.j.,I wanted to get some air.
34410,c.j.,Simon...
34411,c.j.,I'm standing in the middle of the President's security detail. What do you think's gonna  happen to me?
34412,c.j.,Maybe if we didn't shout so much.
34413,c.j.,"Oh, I'm sorry you feel that way. I think I've been a treat."
34414,c.j.,You seem a little riled.
34415,c.j.,"I don't think any of it's your fault, and I appreciate everything you've done."
34416,c.j.,I do like you.
34417,c.j.,I said I do like you.
34418,c.j.,So did I. I tried to kiss you.
34419,c.j.,"I was lying, you idiot."
34420,c.j.,I was embarrassed. I fumbled it.
34421,c.j.,It sounded like an excuse.
34422,c.j.,You watched me at Barney's?
34423,c.j., What in God's name are you talking about?
34424,c.j.,"You're saying I need to take my protection more seriously? 'Cause Simon, this is happening  to me. I think I take the situation plenty seriously, but I have to live my life, so maybe..."
34425,c.j.,I shouldn't be talking.
34426,c.j.,What do you mean?
34427,c.j.,They have him?
34428,c.j.,Where was he going?
34429,c.j.,This is over.
34430,c.j.,I meant for me.
34431,c.j.,Thank you.
34432,c.j.,Seriously.
34433,c.j.,Thanks.
34434,c.j.,How about a drink?
34435,c.j.,Can you meet me after the play?
34436,c.j.,Good.
34437,c.j.,Anywhere you want.
34438,c.j.,I have to go to work.
34439,sam,He went to the Yankee game.
34440,toby,Ritchie?
34441,sam,Yes.
34442,toby,He's at the Yankee game right now?
34443,sam,Local news covered it. He said this was how ordinary Americans got their entertainment.
34444,toby,I've been to 441 baseball games in Yankee Stadium. There's not a single person there who's  ordinary.
34445,sam,I know.
34446,toby,You making fun of the Yankees?
34447,sam,No.
34448,toby,Now?
34449,sam,I'm not.
34450,toby,They went to the Yankee game.
34451,sam,He's coming at intermission.
34452,toby,"Well, I'm not sure that suits me."
34453,sam,I know what you mean.
34454,toby,Making an entrance after the President. That's just not how we play bridge. It's not how  we say cricket.
34455,sam,"Okay, but you're starting to freak me out a little bit."
34456,toby,Just talk to me a minute.
34457,sam,How many people are at the game?
34458,toby,"It's a good game. About 40,000 probably."
34459,sam,"There was an incumbent President, who was facing a primary challenge, and on the day of the  primary, his staff sent his motorcade into a district that was heavily favored by his  opponent in order to tie up traffic. Now I would like it plain that I would never do anything  to temper an election, but..."
34460,toby,I am so... proud of you.
34461,sam,You're really very much freaking me out.
34463,josh,Hey.
34464,toby,Hey.
34465,toby,"Listen, I'm gonna send the motorcade up to Major Deegan. Is that okay with you?"
34466,josh,Why?
34467,toby, Josh has a good point. We should think of a reason.
34468,josh,Why don't you guys get back to me?
34469,toby,How's it going?
34470,josh,They'll start voting in about half an hour.
34471,toby,You bringing in Brenda?
34472,josh,Yeah.
34473,toby,I didn't hear you.
34474,josh,"Yeah, we're bringing in Brenda. We're gonna make her Chairman of the Platform Committee."
34475,toby,"Hey, did I put too much pressure on you with the vote?"
34476,josh,No.
34477,toby,With the Ritchie meeting and the A.P. quote?
34478,josh,No.
34479,toby,And I understand the President jumped up and down on you pretty hard last week.
34480,josh,"It's over, Toby. We won."
34481,toby,"Amy's incredibly employable, Josh."
34482,josh, All right.
34483,toby,All right.
34485,josh,I bought her boss.
34487,josh,"No, she'll lose it for sure. Anyway, good job.  See you tomorrow."
34489,josh,We won by eight.
34490,toby,He should have take the Cross Bronx to the West Side.
34491,sam,"I don't know... but I want to tell you some good facts. $1.8 million raised for the Catholic  charities tonight. Thanks to the people who made it. While we're talking, the House is passing  the President's welfare reform bill, and he appreciates all the governors who worked the vote."
34492,toby,And the Yankees are about to snap a 12-game winning streak. Thanks a lot.
34493,sam,"What Toby means to say that if 90% of success is showing up, we're just happy that someone's  standing up for the other ten."
34494,toby,I love the theater.
34495,sam,I know what you mean.
34496,bartlet,What's going on?
34497,bartlet,From this afternoon?
34498,bartlet,"Are you pledging a fraternity or something, 'cause this would be a good one."
34499,bartlet,What's with you and this woman?
34500,c.j.,Somebody's made a mistake. He was just on his way to the field office...
34501,c.j.,Excuse me.
34502,josh,What'd you think I was gonna do?
34503,josh,And?
34504,josh,Are you fired?
34505,josh,Do you have to?
34506,josh,I'm not a dating service.
34507,josh,"Every serious Democrat is gonna unite behind this President, and I'm not kidding around."
34508,josh,Yeah? How's it going so far?
34509,josh,That's what's scaring the hell out of me.
34510,josh,You can't win the White House while the middle class thinks you disdain work and responsibility.
34511,josh,That's not what we did.
34512,josh,Do you not consider it relevant that it would be worse with Rob Ritchie in the White House?  Why is that not part of the equation?
34513,bartlet,Civilians get trials.
34514,leo,I'd argue he's not a civilian. So would the Attorney General.
34515,bartlet,"They're gonna find out it's us. We could make it look like the plane went down, but they're  gonna find out it's us, and I'm gonna be running for reelection while I'm fighting a war  against Qumar."
34516,leo,That's why you want to say no?
34517,bartlet,I want him tried.
34518,leo,That can't happen.
34519,bartlet,I understand.
34520,leo,I was talking this morning about how Mallory names all the lobsters in the tank.
34521,bartlet,Yeah.
34522,leo,Would it be helpful if I brought you a list of names of Shareef's victims?
34523,bartlet,What do you want from me?
34524,leo,"Who was the monk who wrote, ""I always don't know the right thing to do, Lord, but I think  the fact that I want to please you pleases you.""  You have two minutes, sir."
34525,bartlet,This isn't a matter of religion.
34526,leo,"Yes, sir."
34527,bartlet,I recognize that there's evil in the world.
34528,leo,"What is your objection exactly, sir?"
34529,bartlet,Doesn't this mean we join the league of ordinary nations?
34530,leo,That's your objection? I'm not gonna have trouble saying the Pledge of Allegiance tomorrow.
34531,bartlet,That's not my objection.
34532,leo,Sir...
34533,bartlet,It's just wrong. It's absolutely wrong.
34534,leo,"I know, but you have to do it anyway."
34535,bartlet,Why?
34536,leo,'Cause you won.
34537,bartlet,Take him.
34538,bartlet, Caught me.
34539,bartlet,Governor.
34540,bartlet,I am. How about you?
34541,bartlet,"Yeah, I know. Listen, politics aside, and I don't want to make a big deal out of it, but  you probably insulted the church, and you can head it off at the pass if you speak to the  Cardinal tonight."
34542,bartlet,No.
34543,bartlet,"Yeah.  No, I don't understand that. The center fielder for the Yankees is an accomplished  classical guitarist. People who like baseball can't like books?"
34544,bartlet,No. Something horrible happened about an hour ago.
34545,bartlet,"C.J. Cregg was getting threats so we put an agent on her. He's a good guy. He was on my  detail for a while, and he was in Rosslyn. He walked in the middle of an armed robbery,  and was shot and killed after detaining one of the suspects."
34546,bartlet," We should have a great debate, Rob. We owe it to everyone. When I was running as a  governor, I didn't know anything. I made them start Bartlet college in my dining room.  Two hours every morning on foreign affairs and the military. You can do that."
34547,bartlet,"I wasn't, Rob. But you've turned being un-engaged into a Zen-like thing, and you shouldn't  enjoy it so much is all, and if it appears at times as if I don't like you, that's the  reason why."
34548,bartlet,They're playing my song.
34549,bartlet,"In the future, if you're wondering, ""Crime. Boy, I don't know"" is when I decided to kick  your ass."
34550,bartlet,You know the story about...
34551,bartlet,"There's a guy down here holding a sign that says, ""Eight more years."" Don't get me wrong,  I like your thinking, but I've probably tested the Constitution about as far as Abbey's  going to allow me to for a little while.  We need to find energy alternatives. We're getting  our cue. We're getting it right now. The Republicans are busy. They're trying to convince  us that they care about new energy and that they're not in the vest pockets of big oil,  and that's a tough sell. I don't envy them, 'cause their only hope is that we don't notice  that they're the ones who are filling the hole with water every night, and I think Americans  are smarter then that. I think we noticed. "
34552,c.j.,Where are Josh and Toby?
34554,c.j.,Cathy...?
34556,c.j.,"He's wrapping up, and we're getting right in the car. We're already late for Unionville."
34558,c.j.,Thanks.
34559,bartlet,"This isn't a time for people whose doomsday scenario is a little less at the pump for Texaco  and Shell. This isn't a time for people who say there aren't any energy alternatives, just  because they can't think of any. This is a time for American heros, and we reach for the stars."
34560,josh,Yeah. Yeah.
34561,josh,Because the President's speaking.
34562,toby,It's tough to explain.
34563,josh,"No, it's not."
34564,toby,Shh. Okay.
34565,josh,"The President has his blood pressure taken every morning. On higher blood pressure days,  Toby's not allowed to be in the President's sight line while he's speaking."
34566,toby,Stepped on it.
34567,josh,He has trouble concealing his displeasure.
34568,toby,"Stepped on it and he knows it, too."
34569,josh,What do I say to people who ask why we subsidize farmers when we don't subsidize plumbers?
34570,josh,Okay.
34571,toby,Shh. Okay.
34572,toby,"We worked with the Confernce Committee to increase payment limits for small farmers and  we'd have done it too, but no one could agree what ""small"" meant."
34574,josh,I think we better head back.
34576,toby,"No, we're just talking."
34578,josh,"Donna's a little nervous. A couple of weeks ago, some guys got left behind by the motorcade  in Kentucky."
34580,josh,They took a cab.
34581,josh,"I think the real point is, whatever Toby and the Conference Committee... Whatever definition they  came up with would've just created more business for the lawyers for the big farm corporations.  I wished we could've had more time to talk, but..."
34582,josh,"Nah, we've got one more stump in Unionville, and then we get on the plane. It's a full schedule  at the office."
34583,josh,No.
34584,toby,They're voting for Ritchie.
34585,toby,"Indiana's voting for Ritchie. If there was someone less competent than Ritchie on the ballot,  that's who Indiana'd be voting for."
34586,toby,"When somebody can give me an answer to that question, I'll let you know."
34587,josh,We paid farmers $67 billion over the last three years.
34588,josh, You want to lighten up a little?
34589,toby,I am lightened up. This is me lightened up. You're saying lighter?
34590,josh,Yeah.
34591,toby,Okay.
34593,josh,No... she's right. Where is it?
34594,toby,Where is it?
34595,josh,"Where's the motorcade. Hey, excuse me. Where's the motorcade?"
34596,josh,Hey! Hey!
34597,josh,"All right, Donna, listen, we got to get the trailer car."
34599,josh,Call Campaign Scheduling and Advance and tell them...
34601,josh,You got to hang up with whoever you're tallking to. Call Campaign Sceduling and Advance...  Unless you're already talking to Campaign Scheduling and Advance.
34603,josh,Really?
34605,josh,"Good budget cut. Good item. Cathy, where's the closets cab?"
34606,josh,All right.
34608,josh,Really?
34609,josh,"Okay, this car... it can..."
34610,josh,Toby!
34611,josh,Thank you very much. Who's Cap?
34613,josh,Toby!
34614,toby,Yeah?
34615,josh,We got a ride.
34616,toby,Excuse me?
34617,toby,You heard the speech right?
34618,toby,"The section on HMO's, did he land it?"
34619,toby,"He didn't, did he?"
34620,toby,The muddy hole joke?
34621,josh,Toby.
34622,toby,Okay. Thank you.
34623,josh,Let's go.
34625,leo,Is the First Lady still in Madison?
34626,leo,Tell me again when the President's back.
34627,leo,What's his first?
34628,leo,The Treasurer of the United States deals with the color of money. What's the meeting about?
34629,leo,Push it and push his meeting on health and fitness. I want the Trade Rep and as many of the  economic advisors as we can at the 3:30.
34630,leo,"Oh, Merciful god."
34631,leo,I had half a grapefruit.
34632,leo,You think I'm lying?
34633,leo,Okay.
34634,leo,I'll be in the Sit Room for a minute. I'd like him when he's done at the site.
34635,leo,Good morning.
34636,leo,The Dow's down 260.
34637,leo,What do I know. Could somebody get me half a grapefruit? I got Jack LaLanne working for me  this week. Let's go around the table for the quicksheet.
34638,leo,"That's a reaction to the President's trip to Seoul, right?"
34639,leo,Okay. South America?
34640,leo,"Is Velasco's governmet in danger, or is this just another crazy general with guns?  No offense, Fitz."
34641,leo,Okay. Africa.
34642,leo,A peacekeeping force to distribute grain.
34643,leo,Middle East.
34644,leo,To where?
34645,leo,About what?
34646,leo,They find anything?
34647,leo,Yeah.
34648,leo,Yeah. All right. Eastern Europe.
34649,sam,"Yeah, I just wanted to check with..."
34650,leo,Hey.
34651,sam,I just...
34652,leo,Go home.
34653,sam,I am.
34654,leo,You haven't had a day off since the convention. You've been up the past two nights and  I don't want a zombie.
34655,sam,Right.
34656,leo,The energy book is done; the Midwest poll is out. Pawn off the surrogate movement and get  a few hours of sleep.
34657,sam,I just came to check on the Southern Governors. Somebody's got to be watching the politics.
34658,leo,Somebody is-- the White House Office of Political Affairs.
34659,sam,Where is he?
34660,leo,He's about to go on at Ft. Bristol.
34661,sam,You know the Dow's down 270.
34662,leo,Go to sleep.
34663,sam,I'm not fighting with you.
34664,bartlet,"Captain, good to see you."
34665,bartlet,Good morning.
34666,c.j.,He won't.
34667,c.j.,He won't.
34668,c.j.,No.
34669,c.j.," Gehrman-Driscoll announced before the bell it was filling for bankruptcy;  an hour later, Jennings-Pratt and DWA."
34670,bartlet,They had exposure in the fund?
34671,c.j.,Yeah.
34672,bartlet,I'm amazed it's only down 270.
34673,c.j.,It's early.
34674,bartlet,That's what you want to say to me?
34675,bartlet,"Driscoll announced it was filling, and Jennings and DWA were in the fund."
34676,bartlet,It's against the law to campaign on a military base.
34677,bartlet,"No, legally."
34678,bartlet,These army guys are DRF-1. They're division ready. They can be deployed in two hours.  These navy guys are going to deploy overseas for six months.
34679,bartlet,"C- bag and M-16, they're on a C-130 going where ever I tell them. And that's when their  wives are told. I don't want to screw around with them."
34680,bartlet,Yeah.
34681,bartlet,Good morning. We haven't meet. I'm your Commander in Chief. 
34682,bartlet,"This is the greatest fighting force in the history of the world, and I want to tell you why."
34683,josh,You did it yourself?
34684,toby,He's out there right now. He started.
34685,josh,We really need to get this guy to Unionville. He's going to wig.
34686,toby,He's out there.
34687,josh,Take you mind off it. Think about the lovely Cathy-- farmer's daughter with a master's degree.  Wholesome but... maybe not too wholesome. I think she liked you too.  How do you know Cathy?
34688,josh, That's great. She's really nice. Is that corn out there?
34689,josh,What is it?
34690,josh, Okay.
34691,bartlet,"So what will I remember? What will I tell my grandchildren? I'll tell them that I stood on the  Great Wall of China, and that I stood in the well of the U.S. House of Representitives. I'll tell  them that I sat with kings and cardinals and made an appointment to the Supreme Court, and I'll  tell them that one morning in September I got to spend a few minutes with the men and women of  Air Wing One. God bless you and your families and may he continue to shed his magnificent grace  upon the United States of America."
34692,c.j.,I need to talk to you about something.
34693,leo,"Good morning, sir."
34694,bartlet,How's it going?
34695,leo,You tell me.
34696,bartlet,It feels good.
34697,leo,You know about the Dow?
34698,bartlet,Jennings-Pratt was in the fund?
34699,leo,Yeah.
34700,bartlet,It'll rebound.
34701,leo,Yeah.
34702,bartlet,"No kidding, it feels good out here."
34703,bartlet,What are you doing?
34704,leo,I'm going to meet with Fitzwallace for a minute.
34705,bartlet,About what?
34706,leo,Nothing.
34707,bartlet,You don't meet with Fitzwallace about nothing.
34708,leo,Just something from the quicksheet briefing.
34709,bartlet,What?
34710,leo,Nothing.
34711,bartlet,Leo...
34712,leo,Qumar's reopened the investigation.
34713,leo,Mr. President?
34714,bartlet,"Yeah, all right. Well, we're coming home now."
34715,leo,"Yes, sir."
34723,josh,Why are we slowing down?
34724,josh,Are we out of gas?
34725,josh,Are we out of it?
34726,toby,Nobody cares.
34728,toby,They don't have diesel.
34729,josh,Did we run out of gas becasue I said she was wholesome but not too wholesome?
34730,josh,"I don't know, you can make glow plugs explode things."
34733,josh,What are you going to do?
34734,josh,Somebody's going to pick you up out here?A black pick-up truck approaches and stops.
34735,josh,How you doing?
34736,josh,Thanks for all the help.
34737,josh,"Okay, call the State Office. Tell them to send a local volunteer. Tell them we don't  have time... You're doing it right?"
34739,josh,This is fun. We're roughing it.
34740,josh, This is fun.
34741,leo,Thanks.
34742,leo,I'm sorry?
34743,leo,I don't know. Maybe they were making pies.
34744,leo,Send him in.
34745,leo,Yeah.
34746,leo,And that really happens?
34747,leo,The Bermuda Triangle.
34748,leo,I thought maybe it was like Toscanini landing in a cornfield.
34749,leo,Is there a chance they're going to find the plane?
34750,leo,Okay. Let's obviously stay in touch during the day.
34751,leo,"Just out of curiosity, what do you think would happen?"
34752,leo,"Yeah, well, they can invite all they want. He ain't going."
34753,leo,Perhaps this would be a good time for you to...
34754,leo,Yeah.
34755,leo,Thank you.
34756,c.j.,"Tonight-- I was wrong about this, tonight's black tie and pool pencil only. We've got a new  addition to our running list of things Robert Ritchie's not. Speaking this morning at the  Philadelphia Financial Council the Governor said, ""I'm no scientist, but I know a thing or  two about physics."" So, for the week, you can add ""scientist"" to ""doctor,"" ""mind reader,""  and ""Chinese."""

34762,bartlet,Yeah?
34763,bartlet,Come on in. Nice to meet you.
34764,bartlet,"I's crazy I know, but sometimes the schedule gets so tight that we have to schedule meetings  on the plane, so we ask you to fly with us and hit you on the way back."
34765,bartlet,Were you impressed by the plane?
34766,bartlet,It's got an apartment and an operating room.
34767,bartlet,"Okay. Well, you've met with Donald McKittridge-- he directs the Office of Presidential Personnel."
34768,bartlet,You had a moment to meet with Charlie Young?
34769,bartlet,He's probably mentioned that this was a job where you to need to be able to hold a lot of  names and dates and numbers in your head.
34770,bartlet,You were told what the pay scale was?
34771,bartlet,And some of the perks?
34772,bartlet,"Well, for instance, we have our own 747, and it's flown by an Air Force general."
34773,bartlet,"Okay, let's talk about your last job."
34774,josh,Good morning. We're stranded and waiting for a ride. Do you mind if we wait here?
34775,josh,"Well, we work for the President, actually, and he was campaining nearby this morning and..."
34776,josh,"...we got left behind by the motorcade, then our ride ran out of diesel..."
34777,josh,"Okay. Well, we'll just wait outside, if that's all right?"
34778,josh,"Well, we'll just be a few minutes, I'm sure."
34779,josh,Can we just call ahead and make sure the plane's going to be there when we fet there?
34781,josh,Can you call ahead?
34783,josh,Keep trying.
34784,josh,See that?
34785,josh,First guy to miss.
34786,toby,What's the bet?
34787,josh,First guy to miss has to shave his beard.
34788,toby,"For the rest of the day... first guy to miss... anytime he says his name, has got to follow  it with, ""I work at the White House."""
34789,josh,All right. But I don't think you've meet our current host. Here we go.
34790,toby,You didn't say if you thought it was a good event this morning.
34791,josh,"Well, I didn't see the President speak this morning."
34792,toby,I know.
34793,josh,I was out there talking with Cathy-- I was asked to.
34794,toby,Yeah.
34795,josh,I was.
34796,toby,But you read the remarks.
34797,josh,Yeah.  What was your problem?
34798,toby,"You know what, Josh? I don't want this to be a high blood pressure day for me, either."
34803,josh,"""He pretends there are no energy alternatives 'cause he can't think of any."" That wasn't in the  staff copy yesterday. How did that make it into the speech today? ""He pretends there are no  energy alternatives 'cause he can't think of any."" "
34804,toby,They. They can't think of any.
34805,josh,"When we were touring flood damage in Missouri last Thursday, four times the President said,  ""Emergency managments complex."""
34806,toby,It is complex.
34807,josh,What does that matter to people who just lost their house? Finding a place for their kids to  sleep tonight is complex.
34808,toby,"Thanks, 'cause I was having a tough time prioritizing that one."
34809,josh,"Sustainable growth in Michigan, new economy in Ohio. Information technology in Pennsylvania.  That's what you talk about in September. That's what we mapped out a year ago. You and Bruno  and the President are calling audibles."
34810,toby,That's because we're coming to the line and we're seeing a hairdo from Florida in pass coverage  and so that's where we want to put the ball... What's your concern?
34811,josh,"I have any number of concerns, not the least of which we'll lose."
34812,toby,I don't think so.
34813,josh,When did we decide to make this about being the smartest kid in the class? What meeting did I miss?
34814,toby,Let me tell you something. What did he say?
34815,toby,What the hell...?
34816,josh,Tyler...
34818,josh,Would you get in there? 
34821,josh,Josh Lyman.
34822,toby,Toby Ziegler.
34824,toby,I work at the White House.
34825,josh,Come on. He's Communications Diretor. It's a decent-sized whoop.
34826,josh,"Whoa, hey, danger, Will Robison. Tyler, no fooling around. We've got 15 minutes to get  to a plane that is 3 miles from here. That plane-- I swear to God-- is taking off at 1:00."
34827,josh,Yes it is.
34828,josh,It's 12:45.
34831,josh,Wait. Wait. No. No. You're not... We changed time zones? We changed time... We changed time zones?!
34832,josh,Not for the U.S. government!
34833,toby,What kind of schmuck-ass system could this possibly...
34834,josh,That's good! That's perfect!
34835,toby,How did...? I don't understand.
34836,josh,Perfect. Just the break I'm looking for.
34837,toby,"What do...? What do...? People, they just... They reset their watches when they commute?"
34838,josh,I can't take working here.
34839,toby,"They just change their watches every time they cross a time zone? What is this, a joke?!"
34840,josh,Serving my country.
34843,c.j.,Yeah.
34844,c.j.,I'm sorry?
34845,c.j.,"Oh, yeah. Listen, I wanted to ask you something. Simon was a Big Brother to a kid named  Anthony Marcus."
34846,c.j.,I've been trying to spend a little time with him. He's not wild about me.
34847,c.j.,"Yeah? Well, he was arrested for stealing a car. He stole his homeroom teacher's car, drove it  around for a few hours, then left it in front of a strip club. You could chalk it up to a stupid  prank, except Anthony had a string of shoplifting incidents before Simon came along, so the ADA  see it as an escalating problem which is..."
34848,c.j.,"Right, and she's pushing juvenile detention. I've spoken to her and if a White House staffer  will play a role in his life, she's willing to reconsider."
34849,c.j.,I know.
34850,c.j.,I know.
34851,c.j.,"I know, it was a longshot."
34852,c.j.,Yeah?
34853,c.j.,Okay.  I shouldn't have asked you.
34854,c.j.,Sam's next.
34855,sam,Sorry. It's all right. Hang on. No problem. Hi. Sorry.
34856,josh,"No, I'm sorry buddy. I know you're supposed to be sleeping today."
34857,sam,"No, it's no problem. What's going on?"
34858,josh,I'm with Toby and Donna and we are stranded somewhere in Indiana.
34859,sam,You got left behind by the motorcade?
34860,josh,"Yeah. and then we ran out of gas, and then there was a time zone foul-up, and also,  we were waylaid by some mean schoolgirls. Alpha girls, you know what I'm saying?"
34862,josh,They were.
34863,sam,"So, what are you doing now?"
34864,josh,We're getting a lift to the Connersville Metro which is going to take us to Indianapolis  where we're going to get a flight to either Dulles or BWI or LaGuardia.
34865,sam,"Listen, if you want to give me your call sheets and I can farm a out a few memos for you."
34866,josh,"I actually need you to do more than that, Sam. I need you to staff the President. He's got  one of those days."
34867,sam,I don't know what it is you do in there.
34868,josh,"Yeah, you do. Anything ceremonial, security related, or personal, you've leave the room.  As it gets later in the day he's going to start to talk to you. You're going to tell him  how the meeting he just had with his Concil of Economic advisors relates to the meeting  he had with the Agriculture Secretary, relates to his intelligence breifing, relates to  the environment, relates to jobs, relates to education, relates to the campaign. You're  his wide-angle lens. "
34869,sam,There are going to be any number of areas on which I can't give him expert advise.
34870,josh,"Welcome to the club, partner. We got jackets."
34871,sam,All right. I'm not going to let you down.
34872,josh,You never do.
34873,sam,Get dressed... now.
34874,josh,Let's get to the train station.
34875,toby,Get in the car.
34876,bartlet,"There's a tremendous amount of informatin you need to keep track of: dates, names, number,  things I'm not good with."
34877,bartlet,What's that?
34878,bartlet,"It's not intellect, it's memory. It's a different gift. A wonderful one. I've never had it."
34879,bartlet,"Well... okay, I'll try and find that time, but let's get back to you. What would you say was  the most challenging part of working for the Ambassador of France?"
34880,bartlet,Mm.
34881,bartlet,I make fun of the French as much as anybody and I don't even know what that meant.
34882,bartlet,"Nah, that's okay. I think you're terrific and I appreciate your coming in and talking to us."
34883,bartlet,Thanks again.
34884,bartlet,Yeah. Hey.
34885,bartlet,"Please, the market's down 425 points."
34886,bartlet,I know.
34887,bartlet,425 points represents billions of dollars which aren't there anymore heading into the fourth  quarter which is Christmas.
34888,bartlet,What's your good news?
34889,bartlet,You said almost all.
34890,bartlet,Why does Gallup have it a one-point race?
34891,bartlet,"Well, one day I'll buy you a beer and you'll tell us all how you did it."
34892,c.j.,Bruno.
34893,c.j.,"Yesterday, the First Lady appeared on KCAL, which is a local LA station. She was asked about  the suspension of her medical license and she said something like, ""I'm just a wife and mother."" "
34894,c.j.,"This is Flint Aldridge, a Southern Baptist radio host. ""This is another sign that Abbey Bartlet  is a liberal elitist feminist."""
34895,c.j.,And this is from Janet Ritchie.
34896,c.j.,"""Being a wife and a mother are the most rewarding roles I've ever played. I think Abbey Bartlet  and I have two different ambitions."""
34897,c.j.,"Anyway, it's waiting for us down on the ground."
34898,c.j.,Yeah.
34899,sam,It's Bryce.
34900,sam,Okay.
34901,sam,What's the photo-op?
34902,sam,"All right. Do we have some sort of condensed Readers Digest index of... well, all human knowledge?"
34903,sam,"Okay, well, we'll have to talk about that but we'll do it another time. Soon, though. Why don't  you get me my notes from this mornings speech in Bloomfield."
34904,sam,"Hey, were there women with aprons and rolling pins at a rally in Madison, Wisconsin this morning?"
34905,sam,Why?
34906,c.j.,"What the hell does that mean, ""I love it when the women get involved?"""
34907,c.j.,Abbey...
34908,c.j.,This is not a woman's issue. This is dumb woman's issue.
34909,c.j.,Remind me to mention that to the population of South Africa.
34910,c.j.,Can we start?
34911,c.j.,Several of the men I've dated haven't yet gotten over their fear of frogs.
34912,c.j.,I still haven't.
34913,c.j.,"Yeah, the rolling pins took care of that."
34914,c.j.,Remind me to get Josh in on this. Option two?
34915,josh,It's Monday.
34917,josh,"Nothing. It was just something I said. All right, ten minutes. We get the stuff to go."
34918,toby,Tyler?
34919,toby,What's a Hoosier?
34920,toby,Afternoon.
34921,toby,We'd like some food to go.
34922,toby,What's good?
34923,toby,What's your specialty?
34924,toby,Okay.
34925,toby,I swear not on purpose.
34926,toby,"No, uh, we just want food."
34927,toby,You wouldn't say there was some sort of local delicacy...
34928,toby,"Right, uh...  Excuse me. Would you mind terribly if I changed  the channel to CNN for just a minute? I've, uh, been a little out of touch today. I would  like to check in with what's been going on."
34929,toby,I was just asking what's good.
34930,toby,We'll take four cheeseburgers.
34931,toby,Dry rub?
34932,toby,"Okay. See, Fiona, this is exactly what I was talking about."
34934,josh,Yeah.
34936,josh,Yeah.
34938,josh,Yeah.
34940,josh,Why is it we cite Ritchie's advisors by name? The Milton Friedman economic plan? The Leonard  Tynan education plan?
34941,toby,I give credit where credit's due.
34942,josh,"It's our way of calling him a puppet, right?"
34943,toby,"Josh, he cites them more then we do, which is his way of saying, ""I want to be President  the same way you want a cold beer."""
34944,josh,"No. It's his way of saying, ""I think it's great that Bartlet's a Nobel Prize winner.  When I'm elected, I'm going to hire me some of those."""
34945,toby,"No, no. Should be what he's saying. What he's saying is, ""Eastern education isn't for real men,  but don't worry. I'll have Jews for the money stuff."" You mind calling C.J. for me?"
34946,josh,"That line from the convention speech-- ""challenges too great for a Potemkin presidentcy?"""
34947,toby,It is true.
34948,josh,Most people weren't the smartest kid in the class. Most people didn't like the smartest kid  in the class.
34949,toby,Yeah?
34950,josh,I don't care how subliminal it is. This can't be a national therapy session.
34951,toby,Thank you. Hello.
34952,c.j.," Hey, before I forget. If you see Josh, can you ask him to stop by my office?"
34953,c.j.,Toby?
34954,josh,What?
34955,toby,She'd like you to stop by her office.
34956,c.j.,"Toby, are you there?"
34957,josh,"C.J., it's me. Did you happen to notice that we weren't on the plane?"
34958,c.j.,You weren't on the plane?
34959,josh,We missed the plane.
34960,c.j.,What happened between Unionville and the plane?
34961,josh,We missed Unionville. We missed the motorcade.
34962,c.j.,Bummer.
34963,josh,Yeah.
34964,c.j.,I love dry rub. They take the meat and...
34965,sam,"Good afternoon, Mr. President."
34966,bartlet,Seth Weinberger's assistant has come forward with the information that he was having an  affair with a colleague and a newspaper has printed it.
34967,sam,What's the assistant's thing?
34968,bartlet,"You tell me. He'd already stepped down over OSHA. It's been two months. This is an assistant  getting her name in the paper and it's unbelievably hurtful to his wife. I don't understand it.  I don't understand the paper printed it either, but that's another day. This is terrible."
34969,sam,"Yes, sir."
34970,bartlet,Good.
34971,sam,Is there a place you'd like me to stand or sit?
34972,bartlet,Hmm?
34973,bartlet,"Mitch, come on in.  Just rock and roll, Sam."
34974,bartlet,Hey.
34975,sam,"Actually, Mr. Secretary, if you're talking about he stump speech, and energy in particular,  that's not the President's fault. I was just looking at my notes from..."
34976,bartlet,We have your input. You're talking about the exemption.
34977,bartlet,"Developing nations, and I think what's lunacy is a nation of SUV's telling a nation of  bicycles, that they have to change the way the live before we'll agree to do something  about greenhouse emission."
34978,bartlet,"Well, in international law there's a principle called differentiated responsibilties.  We're the ones making the greenhouse gas!"
34979,bartlet,"Mr. Secretary, it's not your job to tell me whose support I'm losing. We have people who  do that. It's your job to tell me whose support you just got for me."
34980,bartlet,Okay.
34981,bartlet, Ed.
34982,bartlet,Whatever. Seth Weinberger's old assistant...
34983,bartlet,"I don't think a lot of blind loyalty, but I think a lot less of blind betrayal."
34984,bartlet,"Yeah, that's probably why."
34985,bartlet,"Could somebody get Leo for me, please? Peter, you hear that? He called you ""congressman."""
34986,bartlet,"You think when your folks got you out in '74, they imagined they were taking you to a place  that'd be willing to make you a Congressman?"
34987,bartlet,Me too. How's fishing?
34988,bartlet,You catch any marlin?
34989,bartlet,"Takes a fisherman to catch one, though, right?"
34990,bartlet,"Okay, I'm just saying."
34991,leo,"Good afternoon, Mr. President."
34992,bartlet,"Leo, meet Congressman Peter Lien, Texas 22nd. Peter, this is Leo McGarry, U.S. Air Force,  144th Fighter Wing."
34993,leo,"Pleased to meet you, Congressman."
34994,bartlet,"Peter's family fishes in Galveston Bay, but they don't catch marlin. It's a sore spot,  and he doesn't like to talk about it. Peter's 34 years old."
34995,leo,I'm sorry it's been two months and we haven't been able to get you up here until now.
34996,bartlet,"Ordinarily I would tell you that Jim Coor was a good public servant, and you've got big shoes  to fill, and he was and you do, but obviously you have a bigger symbolic responsibilty then that."
34997,bartlet,"But you biggest responsibiltity isn't symbolic, right?"
34998,bartlet,What is it?
34999,bartlet,"Welcome, my freind, to the show that never ends."
35000,bartlet,Isn't that a hell of a thing? What's next?
35001,bartlet,"Yeah, it's a proud day for Alfred Nobel."
35002,bartlet,When do you think I say something?
35003,sam,If Japan doesn't step up.
35004,bartlet,Tell me again.
35005,bartlet,Mr. Kieth.
35006,bartlet,"I told my granddaughter I was meeting you and I asked what question she wanted me to ask you  and she said to ask you of all the presidents you've met, who is your favorite and I assured  her that it would be me."
35007,bartlet,"Okay, well, I was just kidding, but, sure Truman, if you like that kind of thing."
35008,bartlet,How old were you when you met President Hoover?
35009,bartlet,The 23rd?
35010,bartlet,"No, no. It's just... it's... You shook hands with him, and next day the Great Depression started."
35011,bartlet,"Okay. Stock market took a stumble today. You know, we'll call it... well, a little bigger than  a pre-rally decline. If you watch the news or read a newspaper or really are alive in any way,  you're going to hear about it in the next couple of hours. I'm not worried though, 'cause Tokyo  opens at 7:00 PM Eastern and Tokyo's going to be my mother's milk tonight. It's in the bag."
35012,bartlet,No.
35013,bartlet,"I'm sorry. Sorry, could I just have one second? Charlie? "
35014,bartlet,How you doing?
35015,bartlet," There's a lot of science in economics to be sure  but like a lot of things, a lot depends on the user. I need the Nikkei Index to do what  I need it to do tonight and I've got Hoover's good luck charm over here. But now, while  I'm talking about it, I feel like it's ridiculous that someone like me would consider  canceling a photo-op..."
35016,bartlet,"I'm not, it's momentary."
35017,bartlet,Really?
35018,bartlet,I didn't know you were superstitious.
35019,bartlet,No.
35020,bartlet,"Charlie, just out of curiosity, in your mind, how much time do I spend thinking about your desk?"
35021,bartlet,How long have we been talking about this now?
35022,bartlet,"Okay, let's not tell anybody that."
35023,bartlet,Just scheduling.
35024,bartlet,Thank you.
35025,c.j.,Sam?
35026,sam,Yeah.
35027,c.j.,Whatcha' doin' on the floor?
35028,sam,I don't know. I think it was just the closest thing.
35029,c.j.,"Come on, you'll get your pants all shmutsy."
35030,sam,"The First Lady's not a lesbian, is she?"
35031,c.j.,I don't know. I can ask her.
35032,sam,Why were there rolling pins?
35033,c.j.,"Brenda Swetland: ""At this moment, you're not licensed to practice medicine, correct?""  A. Bartlet: ""At this moment, I'm just a wife and mother."""
35034,sam,I don't see it.
35035,c.j.,"Well, you got to want it."
35036,sam,"Oh, I see it."
35037,c.j.,Yeah.
35038,sam,What are we doing?
35039,c.j.,"Well, I wanted my office to issue a statement saying, ""You're annoying, shut up,"" but Bruno  said to wave at it and he's right."
35040,sam,Yeah.
35041,c.j.,"Listen. I know this is the last thing you want to hear right now but I want to get Anthony a  Big Brother and Charlie said no, and I thought if it was anything you might be interested in,  I could talk to you about it. It's an hour a week. He doesn't have anybody and you know he  hasn't gotten over Simon."
35042,sam,You asked Charlie first?
35043,c.j.,There's no way you have time for this.
35044,sam,I might.
35045,c.j.,You don't.
35046,sam,Ginger.
35047,c.j.,You just worked 48 hours straight.
35048,sam,Yeah.
35049,c.j.,And that was the weekend.
35050,sam,"Maybe he'd enjoy sitting and watching me work. I could narrate what I was doing for him.  ""Right now I'm reading background intelligence on Central America as it relates, believe  it or not, to textile imports. Ooh, intelligence, 007."" See, and right away I've got him  going with 007."
35051,c.j.,"I'm sitting here listening, already I've turned to a life of crime."
35052,sam,You know I'd do it if I could.
35053,c.j.,I do know that shmutsy pants.
35054,sam,"That's going to be around for a while, right?"
35055,c.j.,How's it going in there?
35056,sam,"It hasn't really started yet. Bryce, you know, is pushing him away from unilateral standards,  but the rest of the meetings don't start for 20 minutes."
35057,c.j.,Thanks.
35058,sam,Hey?
35059,sam,"Fine,so far."
35060,josh,"Just Bryce, right?"
35061,sam,Yeah. Let me ask you something. He was saying that Commerce didn't have enough input on the  stump speech and I started to say that it was my fault and the President kind of ran me over. 
35062,josh,"Yeah, he doesn't like the appearance that his staff is covering for him."
35063,sam,It genuinely wasn't his fault.
35064,josh,Nothing's not his fault in the Oval Office.
35065,sam,Got it.
35066,josh,Anything else before we get on the train?
35067,sam,Could you put Toby on?
35068,josh,Yeah. Toby. Sam.
35069,toby, Was Bryce pissed?
35070,sam,"Yeah. Listen. With the secretarial candidates the last few weeks, Charlie says he's been asking  questions about remembering names and numbers. He's worrying about short term memory loss, right?  It's one of the effects of..."
35071,toby,Yeah.
35072,sam,Okay.
35073,toby,Anything else?
35074,sam,Come home.
35075,toby,We're on our way. 
35076,josh," Don't worry, I'll have Jews for the money stuff? You have an inadvertant habit of  putting down my Judaism by implying that you have a sharper anti-Semitism meter then I do."
35077,toby,"You know, the Ancient Hebrews had a word for Jews from Westport. They pronounced it Presbyterian."
35078,josh,And by saying things like that.
35079,toby,I'm just saying I'm from Brighton Beach.
35080,josh,"Well, Mohammed al Mohammed al Mohammend bin Bizir doesn't make the distinction when he suits  up in the morning."
35081,toby,As long as you have a good grasp of the complexity of that situation.
35083,toby,I assure you neither one of us know. 
35084,josh,"Tyler, assure me there's going to be no trouble."
35085,josh,The train runs on regular fuel.
35086,josh,You guys don't have your very own international dateline in Bloomington or anything?
35087,josh,"In that case, on behalf of Bartlet for America and the Democratic Party, I want to thank you  for your help and tell you that you're a good guy, and good luck to you."
35089,josh,Take it easy.
35090,josh,Call me Josh.
35091,toby,Toby. I work at the White House.
35092,toby,Okay.
35093,josh,The engineer knows the route?
35094,leo,Nancy.
35095,leo,Why?
35096,leo,What's happening?
35097,leo,Of what?
35098,leo,"Why are they saying there is? It's to provoke a response, right?"
35099,leo,And they're using Act V scene from Hamlet? Are these Batman villians?
35100,leo,What?
35101,bartlet,"You can't say ""faith-based initiatives"" to me. You have to be more specific then that.  You can't offer a guy a hot meal but first you have to accept God into your heart.  It's against the law. It's also a little obnoxious."
35102,bartlet,"No, the soup is non-denominational, Fred but I'm not talking about the soup I'm talking  about the programs. And another problem is, the government can't subsidize organizations  that discriminate in hiring practices as religious organizations are allowed to do."
35103,bartlet,"We're going to talk about it around her, but I wouldn't..."
35104,bartlet,Okay.
35105,sam,How are the interviews going?
35106,bartlet,I met with two women this morning on the plane. I'm meeting another in a little bit.
35107,sam,Are either of this morning's women a possibilties?
35108,bartlet,No.
35109,sam,Why?
35110,bartlet,"Well, the first one isn't easily impressed."
35111,sam,What makes you say that?
35112,bartlet,She told me. The second one wasn't funny.
35113,sam,She wasn't funny?
35114,bartlet,"Or rather, didn't think I was."
35115,sam,You told a joke.
35116,bartlet,"She was the secretary to an Ambassador to France. I told her that I'd had dinner with  D'Astier at the Elysee Palace. She gently corrected me at that point calling it the  Palais de l'Elysee-- for that alone I wanted to sent for a parachute. And I made a  joke to D'Astier having to do with cheese and I said that D'Astier was visibly insulted  and that he was reconsidering my diplomatic status and she said, ""Well, did he?"""
35117,sam,She didn't get you were joking?
35118,bartlet,It didn't bode well for me.
35119,sam,Who's this afternoon?
35120,bartlet,"A... crazy woman that Charlie knows. Hey, do we have a GPS reading out on Josh and Toby?  Have they been sighted?"
35121,sam,"I talked to them a little ago, they're on there way."
35122,bartlet,"300 IQ points between them-- they can't find their way home. I swear to God, if Donna  wasn't there, they'd have to buy a house. ""You've got to be able to keep a lot of names  and numbers in your head. Can you do that?"" ""Oh, I should think so."" Oh, should you?  Okay, well, I'm going interview a few more people, in the meantime, you can get your  ass back on the cover of the The New Yoker where it belongs."
35123,sam,"Was that Unimpressed One, or Humorless?"
35124,bartlet,A third one. Charlie say that I don't want anyone to replace her.
35125,sam,Is that true?
35126,bartlet,"I don't know, Sam. I'm a puzzle."
35127,sam,"Yes, sir."
35128,bartlet,This Seth Weinberger thing makes me crazy.
35130,josh,What are the chances of that?
35132,josh,"No, no! Quaint is quaint, but we're not Navajo Indian guides, and if we want weather information  we'll call the White House Operations Center."
35134,josh,Why not?
35136,josh,Cell phone battery's out.
35138,josh,I need information. I need to know what's happening in the world-- I have no idea what's  happening in the world!
35140,josh,I read it! Preparations are on the way for the fair-- I'm briefed. Organizors say it's going  to be the best one yet. What else you got?
35141,toby,Frivolous law firms.
35142,josh,What?
35143,toby,"He meant to say ""frivolous law suits"" and he said ""frivolous law firms."""
35144,josh,Who?
35145,toby,Benjamin Disraeli.
35146,josh,He misspeaks.
35147,toby,"Yes, he does. He also thinks Sarajevo and Bosnia are two different contries, so that's bit  of a setback for the region."
35148,josh,Yes.
35149,toby,"Chaberlain led England in World War II. I don't mind that he doesn't know history, I mind  that he hasn't seen a movie. ""Mexico is part of NATO."""
35150,josh,He meant they were an ally.
35151,toby,"What, did they lob a chalupa at the Warsaw Pact?"
35152,josh,"I agree, it's not impressive but as you pointed out he's going to be surrounded by..."
35153,toby,"Do you think he ever disagreed with one of his advisors? Do you think-- honestly-- do you  think he's ever said to one of his advisors ""I've got a different idea?"" I-I don't care if  he thinks Luxembourg's an uptown stop on the IRT. And I don't care about the Greco-Roman  wrestling matches with the language-- not that polished communication skills are an important  part of this job-- what I care about is when he was asked if he'd continue the current U.S.  policy in China he said, ""First off, I'm going to send them a message-- meet an American  leader."" I don't know what that means, but everybody cheered."
35154,josh,"Which is one of the reasons that I work full-time for his opponent. I don't know what gave  you the impression that I had to be convinced, but I want to win. You want to beat him, and  that's a problem for me, because I want to win."
35156,josh,Yeah.
35157,toby,"""A rising tide sinks all boats."""
35158,bartlet,"Well, it's an election year, Bill. We'd rather people didn't exercise common sense but I  agree with what you're saying."
35159,bartlet,Yes?
35160,bartlet,Really?
35161,bartlet,All right.
35162,bartlet,Hi.
35163,sam,Debbie.
35164,bartlet,You two know each other?
35165,sam,Debbie worked for Donald McKittridge. She's... very interesting. Her resume's impressive;  I remember thinking she was efficient and creative. She's the one who found Charlie.  I remember people talked about her a lot. They found her pretty strange. But I remember  thinking that I didn't find her that strange.
35166,sam,I'm in your corner. 
35167,bartlet,You're the alpaca farmer
35168,bartlet,"You hired Charlie, huh?"
35169,bartlet,I didn't know that.
35170,bartlet,"Well, thanks for that."
35171,bartlet,Who was in second place? Who did I almost get?
35172,bartlet,I like to think about the road not taken.
35173,bartlet,Yeah.
35174,bartlet,David Dweck?
35175,bartlet,Yeah.
35176,bartlet,Thanks.
35177,bartlet,Sorry. Why were you fired?
35178,bartlet,Why were you fired?
35179,bartlet,That doesn't sound quite right.
35180,bartlet,Why were you fired?
35181,bartlet,Only because you're asking for a job.
35182,bartlet,I don't belive you.
35183,bartlet,"No, it's not."
35184,bartlet,Yes.
35185,bartlet,Charlie said it was because of him.
35186,bartlet,He said you hired him and that's why you got fired.
35187,bartlet,No he doesn't.
35188,bartlet,I'm now ordering you to tell me why you were fired.
35189,bartlet,"You were strange the first time I met you, and you're strange now."
35190,bartlet,What?
35191,bartlet,Okay.
35192,bartlet,Tell me why you were fired.
35193,bartlet,"I'm going to figure it out anyway. What I lack in memory, I more than make up for with  exceptional powers of deductive reasoning."
35194,bartlet,All right. I think the interview's over.
35195,bartlet,Thank you very much.
35196,bartlet,"Brian Dweck, CFO of Colfax and contributor to Representative Mark McKittridge whose brother  is the Director of the White House Office of Presidenial Personnel, wants a job for his son,  David-- ""Wants a Dwink of WaWa."" My powers of deduction are not to be mocked. "
35197,bartlet,"She didn't tell me anything. I ordered her to, and she... By the way, my powers of ordering  are a joke. I can create an agency, but I can't get her to... She didn't give you up. She,  um... she didn't give you up."
35198,sam,Was she funny?
35199,bartlet,Have the agents stop her at the door a second.
35200,bartlet,Debbie.
35201,bartlet,Where's the dollar?
35202,bartlet,What's the dollar doing right now?
35203,bartlet,Bring her on.
35204,bartlet,Is the Frist Lady inside?
35205,bartlet,Suppertime.
35206,bartlet,"Medea, you home?"
35208,bartlet,"""Political experts seemed surprised by the Bartlet campaigns decision to position their  candidate against motherhood. Said one spokesperson..."""
35210,bartlet,What?
35212,bartlet,"No, don't do this."
35214,bartlet,About what?
35216,bartlet,How?
35218,bartlet, What the hell are you... It was benign. It was totally benign what you said.  These women are out of their minds. We're laughing about it here.
35220,bartlet,I'm telling... Turn on C.J.'s press briefing. She's been doing 20 minutes up there. They're  booking her into Ceasar's.
35222,bartlet,No.
35224,bartlet,"Ah, you pulled the switcheroo."
35226,bartlet,You deceived me.
35228,bartlet,You played upon my love for you.
35230,bartlet,Yeah. I hired someone today.
35232,bartlet,Yeah.
35234,bartlet,Her name is Debbie Fiderer. She used to work here.
35236,bartlet,Used to be DiLaGuardia.
35238,bartlet,Yeah.
35240,bartlet,She doesn't scare you a little?
35242,bartlet," No. Okay, I'm getting dressed for the thing."
35244,bartlet,Yeah.
35245,c.j.,The First Lady loves two out of the three of her children but she doesn't to tell them which two. 
35246,c.j.,Arthur?
35247,c.j.,That's when it's scheduled. Probably more like 8:30 and he's going to speak for 15 minutes.
35248,c.j.,Last OMB was $11 billion off. CBO missed by $25 billion. There's going to be a deficit but the  CBO's numbers are off. Katie.
35249,c.j.,"He can't say until he see's the bill. All right, that's a full lid. I'll see you all over there."
35250,c.j.,"Hang on a second. Okay, today at 5:32 PM Central Saving Time, two pipe bombs were set off inside  the Geiger Indoor Arena, which is the swimming team's facility at Kennison State University.  The Kennison Hawkeyes. The women's team was hosting a match. A meet with Illinois, Michigan and  Minnesota. They're all Big Ten schools. 44 people are dead.Looks like about 100 people are injured,  about 20 critically."
35251,c.j.," I'm going to have to listen in while I talk to you. Barry,  then Sydney, then Fran."
35252,leo,I didn't say I wasn't going. I said I could live without it.
35253,leo,I forgot about it is all.
35254,leo,"As a matter of fact, I did. I was planning a quiet night..."
35255,leo,"It's not just a cooking show, all right. It's very relaxing. The woman is sublime."
35256,leo,Hold on. Why is she still on?
35257,c.j.,"Well, the information that they were pipe bombs is coming from... We're getting both Campus  Information and Cedar Rapids police and fire but I don't know anymore details on the type of  bombs or the extent of damage..."
35258,leo,Find out what happened.
35259,c.j.,"...getting specifics soon. None of that has been confirmed. Emergency squads are still on the  scene treating the minor... uh, injured. Witness's are saying there were swimmers in the water at  the time of the explosion. I don't think there's been much discussion about motives or suspects.  There's been no mention of any..."
35261,josh,We had to get out. He can't read in a moving car.
35263,josh,I need it to come in through my eyes.
35265,josh,685 points.
35266,toby,"Did it say how, how much the percentage drop was?"
35267,josh,"It did, but by the time I got there my newspaper no longer had the molecular structure of a newspaper."
35270,josh,"Our, our flight, our flight was delayed and we're just looking for some place to dry off and  watch the news."
35271,josh,The Nikkei hasn't reacted...
35272,bartlet,"...restoring abundance amid an economic shortfall, securing peace in a time of global conflict,  sustaining hope in this winter of anxiety and fear. More than any time in recent history, America's  destiny is not of our own choosing. We did not seek nor did we provoke an assault on our freedom  and our way of life. We did not expect nor did we invite a confrontation with evil. Yet the true  measure of a people's strength is how they rise to master that moment when it does arive. 44 people  were killed a couple of hours ago at Kennison State University. Three swimmers from the men's team  were killed and two others are in critical condition. When, after having heard the explosion from  their practice facility, they ran into the fire to help get people out. Ran into the fire. The  streets of heaven are too crowded with angels tonight. They're our students and our teachers and  our parents and our friends. The streets of heaven are too crowded with angels, but every time we  think we have measured our capacity to meet a challenge, we look up and we're reminded that that  capacity may well be limitless. this is a time for American heroes. We will do what is hard We will  achieve what is great. This is a time for American heroes and we reach for the stars. God bless  their memory, God bless you and God bless the United State of America. Thank you."
35273,sam,In the car.
35274,c.j.,"Anthony, I'm so sorry. Thank you for waiting. This thing came up at the last minute. A bomb at a  swimming meet. You probably... I can take you home now. You probably saw it here on the television  sets. "
35275,c.j.,"You know... I really miss Simon, too. That's... probably something we can talk about. I asked around  today. I wasn't able to find anyone, but I'm not done. There are more people I'm asking tomorrow  I'll take you home now."
35276,c.j.,I'm sorry?
35277,c.j.,I don't think you do need a baby-sitter...
35278,sam,I know that voice. (turns around)
35279,sam,I didn't see you.
35280,sam,What makes you think I wrote it?
35281,sam,A little thing called cadence.
35282,sam,How's New York?
35283,sam,For a Zanboni battery?
35284,sam,So you're moving to Chicago.
35285,sam," That is terrible. That is... the worst thing. I am so sorry. I liked him,  too-- his broding stare in the penalty box. If there is anything I can do."
35286,sam,Okay.
35287,sam,Thank you very much.
35288,sam,Yes.
35289,sam,You know anything about choas theory?
35290,sam,"That's about all I know too. But it has to do with there being order and even... great beauty, in  what looks like total choas. And if we look closely enough at the randomness around us, patterns  will start to emerge. I love Josh like a brother and he's a world-class political mind but until  today, I didn't know he was smarter then I was. I've worked here three years and eight months and  until you sit in the room all day, you can't comprehend the chaos of the Oval Office. I had one  good moment talking about the global ripple effect of budget defict, but that was it. The rest of  the day was just keeping up. And this was a pretty light day."
35291,sam,"Oh, I'm not complaining. I'm saying one good moment is great. It's a golf shot. I've got to get back  in there. That's where it's happening. (beat) You came by just to tell me you liked the speech?"
35292,sam,Yeah. I think I stole that from Camelot.
35293,sam,"Yeah. I don't think I'm going to make it, either."
35294,sam,Good writers borrow from other writers. Great writers steal from them outright.
35295,sam,"Good night, Charlie."
35296,c.j.,The picture's from Deanna. I just put it in a frame. I've had it in my office for about a week.  I just keep forgetting to give it to you.
35297,c.j.,Have a good night.
35298,josh,Campaigns aren't about the candidates.
35299,toby,No?
35300,josh,They're about the voters. How-how are we going to create jobs? how-how are we going to get healthcare?  How are we going to make the lights go on? How are we going to protect ourselves?
35301,toby,"Don't you want to ask if the plumber knows which directions the pipes run? Don't you...? Forget the  plumber. Don't... (sighs)... we want leadership to sound and feel like, instead of appealing to  our-our least expensive, however legitimate, desire to fell good about our selves? Don't we want...?"
35303,toby,He started it.
35305,toby,Yeah.
35306,toby,Washington.
35307,toby,Yeah.
35308,toby,No.
35309,toby,Yeah.
35310,toby,A Jack Daniels rocks.
35311,toby,My boss went to Notre Dame.
35312,toby,"Yeah, I-I saw. You invested?"
35313,toby,"I'm Toby Ziegler. I work at the White House. Have a minute to talk? We'd, uh... like to buy you a beer."
35314,leo,"Good morning, sir."
35315,bartlet,The happy fun group.
35316,leo,"We have reason to believe that in the next 48 hours, the Qumari rescue team will announce that they've  recovered a military-issued Israeli-made parchute."
35317,bartlet,They're just allowed to make things up now?
35318,bartlet,They know it was us right?
35319,leo,Yeah.
35320,bartlet,Is that what you think we should do?
35321,bartlet,Yeah.
35322,bartlet,What about you?
35323,bartlet,"I signed a piece of paper, Fitz."
35324,bartlet,"You just hated my living guts when I got this job, didn't you?"
35325,bartlet,"Yeah, you did. I didn't know anything and I didn't have any respect for the Chiefs. You became my  counselor and you wrangled the Chiefs and you brought them to me."
35326,bartlet,"You brought them to me. And you talked Leo into Shareef and he talked me into it. It was my order  and you executed it flawlessly and I stand by it. I stand by you, I stand by you all. I stand by  it till I die. Plus, I'm going to need some cell mates in Holland. So, what do we do now?"
35327,leo,We're in the Situation Room.
35328,bartlet,Let's go.
35329,josh,"You're telling me, we couldn't have just gone to the nearest Chinese restaurant, picked up some  Kikkoman and poured it into the soy diesel thing?"
35331,josh,"Well, we should start making cars that run on ketchup."
35333,toby,"(to shuttle driver) Excuse me, would you mind letting me off up there at the bridge?"
35334,toby,Yeah. I can walk to work from there.
35335,josh,"Yeah, I'll hop out there, too."
35337,josh,"Hey, you're the one who did the number back at the bar."
35339,josh,She can drop you off at home.
35341,toby,"If our job teaches us anything, it's that we don't know what the next President's gonna face. And if  we choose someone with vision, someone with guts, someone with gravitas, who's connected to other  people's lives, and cares about making them better... if we choose someone to inspire us, then we'll  be able to face what comes our way and achieve things... we can't imagine yet. Instead of telling  people who's the most qualified, instead of telling people who's got the better ideas, let's make  it obvious. It's going to be hard."
35342,josh,Then we'll do what's hard.
35343,bartlet,Nancy's in her office. There are some calls I asked her to make.
35344,leo,I've told the President about the parachute.
35345,bartlet,"Listen, I know we're here for a serious purpose, for a sober purpose, but I wanted to say  I've never been a part of a street gang before, and that's basically what we are -- a pretty  well-financed one -- but anyway, I wanted to say it feels good, and I think when we're done  with this meeting, I think we should go out and get girls, and I don't know, maybe knock over  a fruit stand or something."
35346,leo,Okay.
35347,bartlet,We're going to need to learn to sing and dance.
35348,leo,The information is basically coming from the NSC operations unit. 
35349,leo,"Well, the B-movie dialogue aside..."
35350,bartlet,Toby and Josh are back. Toby Ziegler and Josh Lyman missed the motorcade in Indiana yesterday.  It's taken them 20 hours to get home. They're walking into DC right now.
35351,leo,Doesn't matter. Let's assume the Sultan goes to Al Jazeera and announces that Shareef's plane  didn't go down accidentally-- that it was brought down by the Israelis. What are the options  we've come up with so far?
35352,bartlet,You're not curious why they're walking into DC?
35353,leo,No.
35354,bartlet,Walking into DC from where I guess you got to ask.
35355,leo,You want to hunker down?
35356,bartlet,"Okay, just for that, when it comes time to give out gang nicknames, you're going to be... I don't  know, but you're not going to have a good nickname."
35357,leo,Okay.
35358,bartlet,"Ellie had a teacher named Mr. Pordy, who had no interest in nuance. He asked the class why there's  always been conflict in the Middle East and Ellie raised her hand and said, ""It's a centuries old  religious conflict involving land and suspicions and culture and..."" ""Wrong."" Mr. Pordy said, ""It's  because it's incredible hot and there's no water."" (to Leo) I'm hunkered down. I'm going to East  Lansing. We're going to need a lawyer."
35359,c.j.,"There are some 120 news outlets covering the hour-to-hour movements of the President. Only the cream  of the crop ride here with me. The rest are consigned to the zoo plane where they do not have moist  towelettes. This is why I'm so disappointed that with the exceptions of Terry, Mike, Mark and Rachel,  you all misspelled Muhzriabolah."
35360,c.j.,It was misspelled in your copy. I could tell.
35361,c.j.,An advance copy of text? You must be new.
35362,c.j.,"He's obviously going to talk about it, but I don't know what he's going to say. There's a filing center  behind the press riser. You'll have 50 minutes to file while the President meets wit the Executive Board."
35363,c.j.,"Pool photos, that's it."
35364,c.j.,"He's spoken to Chancellor Bayless twice now, and the President's accepted an invitation to speak at the  memorial service on the KSU campus this Saturday."
35365,c.j.,"Well, I'm still referring those questions to Zane Littleton at the FBI. But I do want to underline their  initial finding that it doesn't appear to have been an act of foreign terrorism."
35366,c.j.,"The nature of the explosive. Okay, then. The flight to Battle Creek Air National Guard Base is an hour  and 45 minutes. It will be a 45 minute ride to Michigan State where the President will address the  delegates from the NEA for approximately 25 minutes."
35367,c.j.,"No, they made it home and their mother are very relieved. They've been given a 4 hour vacation.  Anything else? M-U-H-Z-I-R-I-A-B-O-L-A-H. "
35368,c.j.,Why?
35369,c.j.,What are yours?
35370,c.j.,Yeah.
35371,c.j.,You can't be indifferent.
35372,sam,"Bruno. This is Debbie Fiderer, the Presidents new Exec. This is Bruno Gianelli General Chairman,  Committee to Re-Elect."
35373,sam,"Yeah, I think it's Sullivan v. Commission on Presidential Debates ABC, CBS, NBC News et al. "
35374,sam,Happens every four years.
35375,sam,There are like 500 citizens lawsuits trying to get there guy in the debate. It never goes anywhere.
35376,sam,Sullivan v. Commission on Presidential Debates. Stay on it.
35377,sam,"It's a guy suing, so Stackhouse can be in the debate."
35378,sam,He is. He will.
35379,sam,Presumably he's endorsing the President becasue he knew he wouldn't be.
35380,sam,"It'd be bad. Which is why, even if, for some reason he was allowed in the debate, he wouldn't do it.  Stackhouse isn't trying to hurt the President. But let's get back to you. Josh Lyman's going to give  you a security briefing and an ethics briefing. Charlie's going to tell you some things. You have  provisional clearance right now pending the succesful completion of the SF-86 and GC-1 background check."
35381,sam,"It's a questionaire. Extensive questions on your past, personal, professional, financial... pharmaceutical..."
35382,sam,They contact family members and friends and neighbors and former neighbors to corroborate.
35383,sam,"You have a button on your phone, a crash button."
35384,sam,You have a crash button which will bring the Secret Service in instantly and turn your office into a live  microphone which will be broadcast all over the building. It's the button you push if someone's trying to  take the Oval Office. This isn't your last job.
35385,c.j.,"Sam, we need you in here."
35386,sam,Excuse me. 
35387,c.j.,Bruno thinks we dump the whole thing.
35388,sam,"I'm concerned that it's going to look opportunistic if we talk about Iowa at a campaign event. Plus,  we're using the teachers like props."
35389,c.j.,"He's got to mention it, though."
35390,sam,"Yeah, he can't not mention it."
35391,sam,I don't know.
35392,sam,"What are your feelings, sir?"
35393,bartlet,I don't know. It's a seven-ten split. Can you work on it a while?
35394,sam,"Yes, sir."
35395,bartlet,I'm going to call Leo. I'll be in my office.
35396,leo,Let her on in Becky.
35397,leo,Hello. You look sensational in your Gabriella Something thing there.
35398,leo,"""Cloak and dagger."""
35399,leo,"""Cloak and dagger."""
35400,leo,And you sent me a note.
35401,leo,"I was going to come there but then I thought, between the lobby, the elevator, the reception area,  the paralegal's area, the associate's area and the coffee room of a Washingtion DC law firm, there  was an outside chance that somebody might recognize the White house Chief of Staff."
35402,leo,"Well, it may be like I'm in the Mafia, but I'm not. I work for the good guys."
35403,leo,"That's an entirely different kettle of beans and we can have that discussion but history's shown  that if you just wait and tell it to a divorce lawyer, you can have half my stuff."
35404,leo,You don't know-- some of it's good stuff.
35405,leo,Someplace quiet so we can talk.
35406,leo,We just call it that.
35407,leo,"It's a map of North America. What are you worried about? Hey, where are you from?"
35408,leo,"Hey, Lieutenant, can you throw an Opal Drill up on the wall? Lincoln, Nebraska."
35409,leo,"It's showing a first strike nuclear attack from Beijing and North Korea. Hey, look at that. Lincoln  survives the first of... No, not so much."
35410,leo,"What? First of all, we have to go beyond the normal attorney/client privilege. This is sensitive."
35411,leo,"No, I'm talking State secrets with hightest security classification. If you told anyone, you'd be  convicted of treason and sent to prison, probably for life."
35412,leo,"No you wouldn't. It's nothing like treason. But if you told anyone, it'd be bad."
35413,leo,"Do you remember last May, that a private plan carrying Qumari Defense Minister Abdul Shareef went  down near Bermuda and that all the passengers, including Shareef, were dead?"
35414,leo,No?
35415,leo,"Okay, well, it happened. Qumar has been investigating the accident because they believe there was foul  play. And we believe, in fact we know, they're trying to frame Israel. They're producing phony evidence."
35416,leo,I'm sorry.
35417,leo,Because we do.
35418,leo,Jordon. We know any evidence of assassination is manufactured.
35419,leo,'Cause we destroyed all the evidence.
35420,leo,"Yes, sir."
35421,bartlet, How's it going?
35422,leo,Fine.
35423,bartlet,Is she there?
35424,leo,Yeah. What do yo know?
35425,bartlet,"Casper's here, he's going to talk to me. I'll send him to you next, all right?"
35426,leo,Thank you. What are you about to say?
35427,bartlet,I don't know. I still have about two minutes.
35428,leo,Okay.
35429,bartlet,"""The bullying nature of the intrusive and invasive government of the United States has to be rendered  quickly and decisively a wake-up call. And this opportunity..."" What do you think of this letter?"
35430,bartlet,No.
35431,bartlet,Is it credible?
35432,bartlet,You guys think it was sent by the bomber?
35433,bartlet,We think there's a group.
35434,bartlet,The end of the letter promises more.
35435,bartlet,Unless what? That's where I'm confused.
35436,bartlet,"All right, what do you have?"
35437,bartlet,"Yes, plus once we catch a perpetrator, you don't need to track him down."
35438,sam,"I told you, he likes the rhythm."
35439,sam,It's a dummy phrase. It's a placeholder.
35440,bartlet,I think I'm just going to talk for a little bit.
35441,sam,"""Joy cometh in the morning,"" sir."
35442,bartlet,Thank you.
35443,bartlet,"Thank you very much. Thank you. ""Joy cometh in the morning,"" scripture tells us. I hope so. I don't  know if life would be worth living if it didn't. And I don't yet know who set off the bomb at Kennison  State. I don't know if it's one person or ten, and I don't know what they want. All I know for sure,  all I know for certain, is that they weren't born wanting to do this. There's evil in the world. There'll  always be, and we can't do anything about that. But there's violence in our schools, too much mayhem in  our culture and we can do something about that. There's not enough character, discipline, and depth in  our classrooms. There aren't enough teachers in our classrooms.  There isn't nearly enough,  not nearly enough, not nearly enough money in our classrooms, and we can do something about that. We're  not doing nearly enough, not nearly enough to teach our children well. And we can do better, and we must  do better, and we will do better. And we will start this moment today! They weren't born wanting to do this."
35444,leo,"I've been thinking a lot about an egg salad sandwich on a Keiser roll. If it's Milos making the potato  salad, then potato salad. If not, then a potato in any other form will be fine."
35445,leo,I didn't. I was talking to Margaret.
35446,leo," He's got a secret ingredient that he puts in the potato salad that makes you crave  it beyond resonable for something like that. I'm like two, three forkfuls away from te final piece of  the puzzle and then this monkey's off my back."
35447,leo,I was order to this morning by the President.
35448,leo,"He told me to make contact with a lawyer. Commander, Jordan Kendall, please. "
35449,leo,"First of all, that's a nice picture of you. Sometimes, these pictures aren't that nice. Look at that  smile. You could light up Chicago."
35450,leo,"No. But you give these guys some notice, they can put on a show. Second page, please. Maxwell School  of Diplomacy and Internaional Relations. Associate Counsel U.S. Delegation to the United Nations.  General Counsel, US Delegation to the United Nations. General Counsel for the United Nations. Which  is when you found out you could buy stuff with money. Page three, please. Partner, Whitcomb, Wiley,  Hawking, Harrison and Kendall. Was there a Burt Kendall at the firm? Maybe his portraits hanging in  the partners' dining room."
35451,leo,"No, they're talking about you, right?"
35452,leo,"A specialty in internatinal law, you say? Interesting. Have you any experience dealing in matters that  received wide media coverage? Let's take a trip to page four."
35453,leo,You don't even know.
35454,leo,Hmm?
35455,leo,Nobody does. And we're talking about we killed Shareef. We put 14 bullets in his chest on an airstrip  in Bermuda. It's helpful to start saying out aloud.
35456,leo,Yeah?
35457,leo,Come down here and show Ms. Kendall out. Excuse me.
35458,toby,Donna. Josh. Josh.
35459,josh,Yes. I have to talk to you.
35460,toby,I have to talk to you.
35461,josh,Me first.
35462,toby,Why's that?
35463,josh,'Cause it's important.
35464,toby,Okay.
35465,josh,Go ahead.
35466,toby,"No, you go."
35467,josh,I'm perfcetly fine waiting. I have the patience of an adult.
35468,toby,You have 20 seconds.
35469,josh,It came to me in my sleep this morning 'cause whrn I got home the paper was already there. Page two  of the business section in today's Post there's an article about Redstar and the $35 million retention  bonus they gave to... I can't remember his name.
35470,toby,Wadkins.
35471,josh,"So we all know that CEOs get bonuses that workers don't. But in the sixth graph, thay talk about  Congress ending the deductibility of salaries over a million and that the measure excluded items  that the IRS deemed to be incentive based. In other words, the bonuses are tax deductible. In other  words, Wadkins gets $35 million for crashing the company and the company gets a deduction. Toby,  college costs-- investment in the future workforce, in innovation, in the ideas economy, investment  in crime reduction-- Isn't that a better idea then writing off the bonuses? The guy last night in  the bar, Matt Kelley, the one who's taking his daughter to visit colleges. He said it needs to be  just a little easier. Not a lot easier, a little. Toby, every nickel spent on college tuition should  be 100% tax deductible. Not capped and indexed and bracketed. Every nickel. 100 percent. What?"
35472,toby,That's exactly what I was going to tell you.
35473,josh,"No, it wasn't."
35474,toby,Exactly.
35475,josh,You're saying that now just to make it seem... I'm going to make some time with Leo.
35476,toby,And figure out a way to pay for it.
35477,josh,Yeah.
35478,toby,Good.
35479,josh,Good.
35481,josh,Hey.
35483,josh,"I did, but then I read this thing... How you doing?"
35485,josh,What's on for tonight?
35487,josh,Are we in any danger at all of losing Massachusetts?
35489,josh,Why am I doing this again?
35491,josh,I can't we just go straight to the event?
35493,josh,Why?
35495,josh,Who's at the event?
35497,josh,"You've just been practicing for when I asked the question, right?"
35499,josh,And you made up Cruel Shoes?
35501,josh,Okay.
35503,josh,Would you stop.
35505,josh,"You know, everybody's really over that now."
35506,c.j.,"Admiral Scott, your expedition's returned."
35507,josh,All right.
35508,c.j.,"Let me take a look at you, Don Quixote de la Mancha."
35509,josh,Don Quixote wasn't an explorer.
35510,c.j.,"No, but he rode around on a horse. You sleep?"
35511,josh,I did better then that.
35512,c.j.,"Well, keep it to yourself. I need you to weigh in on Ritchie and Title IX."
35513,josh,"Yeah, I saw that. I wrote a memo."
35514,c.j.,Thank you.
35515,josh,"Toby and I are working on tuition, it would be..."
35516,toby,Josh.
35517,josh,They're back.
35518,toby,They are?
35519,josh,Yeah.
35520,toby,Are they being funny?
35521,josh,They're almost over it. We want to talk to you about an issue that should be in play in the campaign  right away.
35522,josh,v. Commision on the Presidential Debates?
35523,toby,They're never going to rule for him.
35524,toby,Yeah. They're never going to rule for him. This suit gets brought all the time.
35525,josh,Wengland?
35526,toby,He's not so crazy?
35527,sam,Hey!
35528,josh,We're back. We'r never leaving again.
35529,sam,Your mother and I were very worried.
35530,toby,"Me, too."
35531,josh,Would you tell him he doesn't have to worry about the District Court?
35532,sam,I told him already. They're not going to rule for Sullivan.
35533,josh,He's worried 'cause it's Wengland.
35534,sam,He's not that crazy.
35535,josh,I'm going back to my office.
35536,josh,I do.
35537,toby,Leo.
35538,leo,They ruled for Sullivan.
35539,c.j.,They ruled for Sullivan?
35540,c.j.,"Can I see a copy of the decision? ""The Commission, tax-exempt entity, is legally precluded from partisan  politics of any kind. The 15% rule, benefiting the two major parties, is partisan politics of the worst  kind --regulatory duopoly, democracy by favoristic fiat, a bureaucratic junta..."""
35541,c.j.,"""...that is clearly prohibited under federal law."" "
35542,toby,"There's no way ""favoristic's"" a word."
35543,sam,"We all agree with you, Toby, we just don't think it's grounds for an appeal."
35544,josh,It's not like we're going to have to search high and low for that.
35545,toby,Yeah.
35546,sam,Yep.
35547,josh,You can be excluded but the bar is set much...
35548,c.j.,"The Republicans, we're going to probably have to let in."
35549,leo,"The appeals process is going to take too long. They're going to have to go to the Supreme Court.  Sam, they can stay the effect of the trial court in advance of appeal, right?"
35550,sam,Yeah.
35551,leo,And you got to get Ritchie's people to join us in the motion.
35552,josh,"Oh, yeah."
35553,leo,All right.
35554,josh,Sam?
35555,sam,Yeah.
35556,toby,"I had a thought before and Toby claims, at any rate, to have had that same thought."
35557,toby,"I showed you, like, DNA evidence of..."
35558,josh,When Congress put the million cap on deducting salary they left a loophole for incentive-based bonuses.
35559,sam,"Yeah, are not all bonuses incentive based? Are there any bonuses you get just automatically? And isn't  that called salary? Which is also incentive-based. By the way, I don't think there are a lot of people  would go to work without one."
35560,toby,Sam.
35561,sam,Come back to the pack?
35562,toby,Yes.
35563,josh,Why isn't college tuiton 100% tax deductible.
35564,sam,I don't know. Why do flammable and imflammable mean the same thing?
35565,toby,"We can cap it at $80,000?"
35566,sam,You're really talking about this?
35567,toby,Yes.
35568,sam,And you pay for it by closing the loophole for bonuses?
35569,josh,"Nobody's talked to the OMB, but I think it cost $50 billion. Closing the loophole is about  $35 billion. Am I close?"
35570,sam,Yeah. And the $15 billion's gettable through...
35571,josh,Yeah.
35572,c.j.,"""Yosh""?"
35573,josh,"She's talking to me, right?"
35574,sam,Yeah.
35575,c.j.,I'm reading your memo.
35576,josh,Memo?
35577,c.j.,The machismo manifesto.
35578,josh,Title IX?
35579,c.j.,"Oh, yeah."
35580,josh,Bruno asked me to weigh in.
35581,c.j.,I can't imagined why he called on you.
35582,josh,"I was asked as a campaign issue if we should re-examine Title IX. Which is, by the way, a wedge with  male voters in Ohio, Michigan and North Carolina."
35583,c.j.,So are a lot of things.
35584,josh,"There's something fair but dumb about a 50-50 split when more men are interested in sports than women--  and don't cite the WNBA and soccer. More men are interested in sports than women. We don't need a study  to tell us that. But if we did, there's about 493 of them."
35585,c.j.,Are you going to talk to someone in Stackhouse's camp?
35586,josh,About the Sullivan decision?
35587,c.j.,You should probably just make sure.
35588,josh,"The Court's going to stay the judgement, even if they don't, Stackhouse will pass on the debate.  He's not out to kill the President. He just wants to keep him honest."
35589,c.j.,"It might be nice if you make a courtesy call though, so we're not taking him for granted."
35590,josh,I'll call Stackhouse.
35591,c.j.,"Since Title IX, women's participation in sports has increased 800%. That's not a typo-- it worked."
35592,josh,Okay.
35593,bartlet,What else?
35594,c.j.,It's making the rounds that Governor Ritchie called the Chancellor's office.
35595,bartlet,What's wrong with that?
35596,c.j.,He's angling for an invitation to the memorial in Saturday. He wants to speak.
35597,bartlet,"Oh, for the love of Mike."
35598,c.j.,The Chancellor was with us in Iowa and the Ritchie people were quietly saying that allowing you to be  National Healer in Chief...
35599,bartlet,"Look, win or lose on the 5th, I'm the President right now, right?"
35600,c.j.,"Um, yeah, I'm almost sure."
35601,bartlet,"Six -- look, six of the girls were exactly Zoey's age. Tell the Chancellor's office that if it'll make  his life easier, I'll sit in row 19 and you'll keep out the press. This has to be about the students  and the families, and Ritchie and I are simply going to have to summon the humanity to keep this from  being a political event."
35602,c.j.,"Yes, sir."
35603,c.j.,Sailor.
35604,leo,"In the Oval Office, you're really going to..."
35605,c.j.,No.
35606,leo,Good.
35607,c.j.,"Thank you, Mr. President."
35608,bartlet,How did you do with Jordan?
35609,leo,"She's a little wary, but I think she might be willing to go out with me again."
35610,bartlet,Yeah?
35611,leo,But you meant the other problem.
35612,bartlet,Yeah.
35613,leo,She's a little wary.
35614,bartlet,Yeah.
35615,leo,She's gone to her office and then she's gone home for the day and she's going to think.
35616,bartlet,"All right. In the meantime, what do we do have by way of stalling tactics?"
35617,leo,A misinformation campaign.
35618,bartlet,We ought to be good at that.
35619,bartlet,State thinks he had a friendly relationship with the West.
35620,bartlet,Shareef is now alive and well and living in Libya?
35621,bartlet,All right. Come back and tell me how we do it.
35622,bartlet,"Blind men. ""The one-eyed man is king in a world of blind men."""
35623,bartlet,"Yes, please."
35624,bartlet,What do you know?
35625,bartlet,The internet has been a phenomenal tool for hate groups.
35626,leo,Good.
35627,bartlet,Don't pipe bombs usually kill two or three people?
35628,bartlet,How is it so many yesterday?
35629,bartlet,No. Thanks.
35630,bartlet,Ten of those under the bleachers at a basketball game?
35631,leo,They've got good leads.
35632,bartlet,Okay.
35633,leo,"Thank you, Mr. President."
35634,bartlet,Charlie?
35635,bartlet,"In ascending order of age, would you get my daughters on the phone, please?"
35636,bartlet,Thank you.
35637,josh,I just tried Stackhouse again.
35638,toby,He hasn't returned?
35639,toby,Stackhouse is going to be fine.
35640,josh,I've called twice.
35641,toby,"At $55,000 Matt Kelly's is in the 27.5% bracket. Let's assume he takes the standard deductions and  let's forget for a moment mortgage payments."
35642,josh,What's his tax liabiity?
35643,toby,"$13,300."
35644,josh,"We're saying that books are tax deductibile, too, right?"
35645,toby,I personally think that beer should be tax deductible
35646,josh,"So, with one kid in college, Mat Kelly's tax liability just dropped from 13,000... to 3,800?  If we can get this done, it'll be a good days work."
35647,toby,Let's take it to C.J. when she get's off.
35648,c.j., Barenaked Ladies helping out in the labor/delivery room of American democracy the  Commonwealth of Massachusetts. 
35649,c.j.,"25 years ago, half of all 18 to 24 year-olds voted. Today it's 25%. 18 to 24 year-olds represent 33%  of the population but only account for 7% of the voters. Think government isn't about you? How many  of you have student loans to pay? How many have credit-card debt? How many want clean air and clean  water and civil liberties? How many want jobs? How many want kids? How many want their kids to go to good schools and walk on safe streets? Decisions are made by those who show up! You gotta rock the vote!"
35650,bartlet,What's going on?
35651,leo,Casper's got something.
35652,bartlet,Allergy medicine?
35653,bartlet,Tractor starter fluid doesn't kill you?
35654,leo,The Sherriff's deputies were shot at from the house.
35655,bartlet,You think these might be our guys?
35656,leo,The address and the name of the occupants match a couple of names that we've linked to the Patriot Brotherhood.
35657,bartlet,We have reason to believe they're connected KSU?
35658,bartlet,Are there kids inside?
35659,bartlet,"All right. Let's get the Director and the Attorney General. We only go in on my order, okay?  It'll be my order."
35660,bartlet,You just knew it was going to end up like this.
35661,bartlet,Allergy medicine and tracker fluid we're getting high on now.
35662,leo,How do we do it?
35663,bartlet,Is this going to get ridiculuos?
35664,bartlet,We'll see it Al Jazeera?
35665,bartlet,"No disinformation to U.S. press, right? We don't give disinformation to the American press? Unless  it's about my health?"
35666,bartlet,"All right, let's go."
35667,bartlet,All this posturing is a preamble to something.
35668,leo,You ready to say hello?
35669,bartlet,Why not?
35670,bartlet,Hey Jordan.
35671,bartlet,What do you think?
35672,bartlet,What do you think?
35673,bartlet,Yeah.
35674,bartlet,That makes three of us.
35675,bartlet,Take all the time you want. You done yet?
35676,bartlet,"Well, that makes us ground-breaking, doesn't it?"
35677,bartlet,More ground-breaking.
35678,bartlet,"Due respect, Ms. Kendall, I'm the last person to whom that needs to be pointed out. And Article 51 of  the United Nations charter says every nation has a right to wage war to defend itself."
35679,bartlet,Wars don't work like that anymore.
35680,bartlet,"44 people are dead in Iowa, and most them college kids. Shareef has murdered Americans in uniform.  He's murdered Americans out of uniform. He was trying to blow up the Golden Gate Bridge, and I didn't  have time to file an amicus brief."
35681,bartlet,"I don't know, I'm working on that."
35682,bartlet,Why?
35683,bartlet,"Well, that's what I was hoping you'd say. I want there to be justice. That's why I'm talking to lawyer.  Anyway, I just came in to say hello."
35684,bartlet,Charlie?
35685,bartlet,I'm heading back to the residence.
35686,bartlet,"Oh, God. Yeah."
35687,bartlet,Arsenic?
35688,bartlet,No.
35689,bartlet,"Why couldn't you have stopped with ""I sincerely apologize?"""
35690,bartlet,"Your argument is totally fuhkakta by the way. The World Bank has a $17 billion budget contributed by  a hundred... Uh, it doesn't matter. Don't worry about it."
35691,bartlet,Yeah.
35692,bartlet,You can keep the job.
35693,bartlet,"Why, because you knock me out, that's why."
35694,bartlet,"""Let's stick some arsenic into President Bartlet's drinking water and see if he delegates responsibility to  the World Bank then."" President Bartlet. You reffered to me and to the office with respect. You're a class act."

35710,josh,What did you say?
35711,josh,"Yeah, I haven't heard back. What... What did you say?"
35712,josh,"Yeah, they're-they're not returning my call. I shouldn't be nervous, right?"
35713,josh,Did you say you missed me?
35714,josh,What do you mean I should be nervous?
35715,josh,We?
35716,josh,The District Court says Howard Stackhouse can appear in the debate. Is Stackhouse... under new management?
35717,josh,"This is not-not the deal we made with them. In one week, he is supposed to endorse te President."
35718,josh,"He's not. So, he's-he's moving you from consultant... "
35719,josh,It wasn't the deal we had. 
35720,sam,"I mean, you got to ask yourself multi-million dollar bonuses are deductible and not tuition?"
35721,c.j.,It's 'casue corporations donate to all the members of the tax writing committee.
35722,sam,I didn't mean you really have to ask yourself. I knew you knew the answer.
35723,c.j.,"Ritchie's all ready coming after us for politicizing the budget. Plus, Leo hates to make policy  through tax code, 'cause then we can't do any kind of reform without unraveling it."
35724,sam,Was that Amy?
35725,josh,"Yeah. If the Sullivan decision's upheld, Stackhouse wants into the debate. He's not going to  endorse the President."
35726,sam,Had to see that coming.
35727,josh,I'm calling Bruno.
35728,sam,"The Court's going to stay the effect. He's not going to be in the debate. Josh'll take care of it.  Anyway, college tuition."
35729,c.j.,Another reason not to do it.
35730,toby,"There are a lot of reasons not to do it. But... we met a guy last night at an airport hotel in the bar.  His daughter was upstairs in the room. They'd been looking at colleges. He makes $55,000 a year. His  mutual fund got beat up yesterday on Wall Street. And he was so happy to be taking his daughter to  colleges. He came downstairs to the bar 'cause he didn't want her to see that he didn't know how he  was going to pay for it. There are a lot of reasons not to do it, but during the first campaign the  President said there are two kinds of politicians."
35731,sam,"The ones who try to say yes, and the ones who try to say no."
35732,toby,We're going to throw these guys out 'cause they want to say no.
35733,c.j.,"I guess if we're going to get thrown out, I don't want it to be for that. Let's take it to Leo."
35734,toby,"Matt, it's me from last night. yeah, we got... got home fine, thanks. Now, let me tell you what we're working on."
35735,josh,"Just throw strikes. I don't understand why that can't happen. You have a three-run lead,  just throw strikes. I mean, my God!"
35737,josh,Yes. 
35739,josh,"I'll tell you something else. In a situation with a runner on first who's a threat to score  and a batter at the plate who's going to be intentionally passed, why not pitch out four times?"
35741,josh,What are the wires?
35743,josh,Give me the AMA.
35745,josh,"You know, there comes a day in every man's life, and it's a hard day, but there comes a day  when he realizes he's never going to play professional baseball."
35747,josh,"Yes I am. You understand, you're going to be walking a guy anyway. You're going to be throwing  four balls. Why not just...?"
35749,josh,"Yeah, why not just, you know, to...  ...catch the runner."
35751,josh,I know how Ritchie's going to win this election.
35752,c.j.,"Red Mass, Red Mass, Red Mass, you say. Red Mass is at... You're right-- 10:00 at the Shrine  of the Immaculate Conception which is also what they called my dorm room in college. No,  but seriously, Katie."
35753,c.j.,"The President believes the debates are good and that more the better. The President's asked for  five debates. Governor Ritchie's asked for two. The President said, ""How about four?"" Governor  Ritchie said, ""How about two?"" We're waiting for the commision to make its recommendation."
35754,c.j.,"At this point, participating in one would be a victory."
35755,c.j.,Which was?
35756,c.j.,270 electoral votes.
35757,c.j.,Seriously. We'll be headed to Rock Creek Park at 2:30. Thank you.
35758,c.j.,I know how Ritchie's going to win this election.
35759,sam,So do I. What's your way?
35760,c.j.,Overcoming perversely low expectations. What's your way?
35761,sam,Getting the President to run the Stackhouse campaign.
35762,c.j.,What happened?
35763,sam,I'm taking you to the meeting.
35764,bartlet,Treasury scored it?
35765,leo,Yes.
35766,bartlet,OMB says it's revenue nuetral?
35767,leo,Yes.
35768,bartlet,"NEC, DPC, the advisors?"
35769,leo,"Yes, sir."
35770,bartlet,Joint tax on the Hill?
35771,leo,Yes.
35772,bartlet,All right. All right. Let's line up validators.
35773,leo,Good.
35774,bartlet,Yeah?
35775,leo,"Toby, Josh. Merry Christmas. He says let's line up the validators."
35776,bartlet,And update our resumes.
35777,leo,"Sam, that'll be you."
35778,sam,Yeah.
35779,toby,I can do it.
35780,leo,Stay on debate prep.
35781,bartlet,What? You're doing the face.
35782,josh,"Needle exchange in a speech to the AMA: ""We ought to begin and end with abstinence. We ought to  begin and end with personal responsibility."""
35783,toby," I'd like someone to ask Ritchie if he's aware that needle exchange cost $9,000 for  every infection stopped. Treating someone with HIV cost $200,000. I'd like someone to ask him  that. I'd like someone to ask him where the repsonsibility was in paraphernalia that made it a  crime to buy or carry a syringe, which is why addicts share infected needles in the first place.  I'd like someone to ask him that, too."
35784,leo,All done?
35785,toby,For the moment.
35786,josh,"It's really only a issue if Stackhouse responds, but if he does..."
35787,sam,Will he?
35788,josh,I don't know.
35789,leo,Will he?
35790,josh,I don't know. But if-if he does we can't come out for it. Bruno thinks we'll be putting three  states back into play.
35791,c.j.,"Ohio, Michigan..."
35792,josh,And Maine.
35793,bartlet,They've always been iffy about me in Maine. I don't know why.
35794,josh,"It's a mystery, sir. You can't come out against either. You'll alienate..."
35795,bartlet,Heroin addicts?
35796,josh,Liberals.
35797,bartlet,Whatever. Let's worry about if Stackhouse does something.
35798,josh,"Okay, but at that point, I'll be very worried."
35799,bartlet,Anything else?
35800,c.j.,Toby...
35801,toby,I'd like someone to ask him about the responsibility in cutting the drug that treatment that would  eliminate needle-related HIV. Half of all people getting infected are getting infected by the needle.  I'd like someone to ask him how he thinks the personal responsibility plan's going so far.
35802,c.j.,"I'll get on that, but I want to talk to you about the debates."
35803,toby,"When we mention that we want five debates, say what they are. One on the economy, one on foreign  policy, with another on global threats and national security, one on the environment, and one on  strengthening family life, which would include health care, education, and retirement. I also think  there should be one on parts of speech and sentence structure, and one on fractions."
35804,c.j.,"Is there any chance I'm going to get an oppurtunity to speak in this conversation, or are you just  writing out loud?"
35805,toby,I didn't even know you were in the room.
35806,c.j.,"Toby, I'm absolutely terrified we're going to lose the expectations game. I can't believe how many  times I get asked what would be a win in the debates. At this point I feel like if -- and only if --  Ritchie accidentally lights his podium on fire does the President have a fighting chance."
35807,toby,I disagree.
35808,c.j.,"Disagree all you want, but I'm right."
35809,toby,"These two men are going to be side by side on the stage, answering questions. That's the ball game."
35810,c.j.,"If the whole thing is, he can't tie his shoelaces and it turns out he can, then that is the ball game."
35811,toby,And I believe he'll have to do more than tie his shoelaces.
35812,c.j.,Not much more.
35813,josh,"Hey, what are you doing tomorrow?"
35815,josh,"Guy, that sounds great. If only you were actually doing all those things."
35817,josh,Teddy Tomba.
35819,josh,"Well, he has millions of followers worldwide, has a $20-billion empire of self-help seminars..."
35821,josh,"...workbooks, board games..."
35823,josh,"Capitol Sheraton, tomorrow morning 10:00 AM. Your registration's been prepaid."
35825,josh,We're efficient.
35827,josh,"He's consulted for Ritchie in the last few weeks, and I would like for that to be embarrassing  for Ritchie."
35829,josh,Yes.
35831,josh,"I don't believe it does. Write down any key slogans, or philosophies, or slogans."
35833,josh,Proabably. You know what I'm looking for.
35835,josh,As what?
35837,josh,Meet me here at the office when you're done.
35838,leo,"Thank you very much, Mr. Foreign Minister. A thousand dead relatives in Scotland just started  crying. Thanks very much.  We're a little late for lunch."
35839,leo,We're thinking about starting our own tabloid.
35840,leo,Iowa.
35841,leo,Idaho. We've had the house surrounded for 11 days. We're trying to negotiate a surrender.
35842,leo,"This people live to be well supplied, Ben. It's their first love."
35843,leo,Yeah. I got to talk to you about something.
35844,leo,Good afternoon.
35845,leo,That was probably an intern. Qumar is ready to announce it was Israel.
35846,leo,"Well, it's come. And I need to put if off at least another week."
35847,leo,I don't want there to be an accusation. I want it to wait another week.
35848,leo,Ben...
35849,leo,You're planning to attack two Qumari training bases in retaliation...
35850,leo,Don't.
35851,leo,"If you hold off, Fitzwallace can get the Qumari Defense Minister to have the Sultan hold off a week."
35852,leo,But...
35853,leo,"No, no, Ben. I think we're in this one together."
35854,leo,When are you flying back?
35855,leo,You can fly on the Sabbath?
35856,leo,You'll take it to the Prime Minister.
35857,leo,A number of people are advising the President.
35858,leo,Will you take it to him?
35859,josh,And now he's on every survivalist's mailing list?
35860,josh,"Anyways, yes, they're well supplied, but they're not endlessly supplied. We can wait them out."
35861,josh,A guy told me I should take flying lessons cause it would relax me. I don't think it you. Do you?
35862,josh,Senator...
35863,josh,"Not having any guns of my own. Obviously you know John Baxley -- Congressman Baxley ... Senators  Jackson and White, Secretaries Weaver and Keaton."
35864,josh,"Excuse me. Now that I have you all sitting down, I'll be right outside the door."
35865,sam,Charlie. I'm eating it on Red Mass. And I don't want to show it to Toby yet. Would you mind  reading it for me and then hitting me in the head with a fairway wood?
35866,sam,"Janet. Or Jeanette, as I sometimes like to call you."
35867,sam,Totally.
35868,sam,You've had a leadership briefing?
35869,sam,That'd be a tough ticket to get.
35870,sam,"As a matter of fact, it was Josh and Toby, but I could see where you'd make the mistake. It does  have the flavor of me, the insouciance."
35871,sam,So guess what I've been asked to do?
35872,sam,Line up validators.
35873,sam,You're the third ranking non-male member of the minority on Ways and Means.
35874,sam,"Listen, the economist are going to say it's good policy. College presidents are going to talk  about shrinking financial aid budgets."
35875,sam,"Sunday mornings. I'll make you a book. Congratulations, Jeanette."
35876,sam,Your best is very good.
35877,sam,"Horton Wilde isn't the same as Thorton Wilder, is it?"
35878,sam,"'Cause if Thornton Wilder had a heart attack, that would be remarkable news."
35879,sam,"He wrote ""Skin of Our Teeth."""
35880,sam,Has a Democrat won the California 47th in the last hundred years?
35881,sam,That's how.
35882,sam,To Orange County? What kind?
35883,sam,Fourth what?
35884,sam,The Democrats have nominated someone who's had three heart attacks?
35885,sam,"And you think I don't care enough about...? What kind of signal does this send to...? I have to  talk... No, this isn't going to be a part of my life."
35886,sam,"Yeah, I do that."
35887,sam,I'll pass it on to Leo.
35888,bartlet,Why do we think the boy is sick?
35889,bartlet,How do you do it?
35890,bartlet,Why?
35891,bartlet,You hear that?
35892,leo,I've seen them.
35893,bartlet,Where's the table?
35894,bartlet,"All right. We should do it. Let's get the kid. Good luck, everybody. Good luck, Casper."
35895,bartlet,What's going on?
35896,leo,Nothing. I was... Nothing. I was thinking about something Yosef said yesterday.
35897,josh,Hello. Is Susan Thomas...
35898,josh,A pain in the ass?
35899,josh,Stackhouse?
35900,josh,I've always like Stackhouse. I'd vote for him too but he's not on the ballot in Conneticut or 22  other states. Perhaps I should vote in New York or California where he's polling at four percent.
35901,josh,I'm sorry?
35902,josh,Yeah.
35903,josh,"And why is that good? Why are we eager...Why are we encouraging a group of people who are so  howl-at-the-moon, lazy-ass stupid that they can't bring themselves to raise their hands?  Why is it important that they be brought into the process?"
35904,josh,I'm not.
35905,josh,You lost your job in a fashion that insured you 93 better offers.
35906,josh,No kidding.
35907,josh,He's taking the President's votes. It's as simple... He is taking the President's votes.
35908,josh,Why?
35909,josh,Hey.
35911,josh,How was it?
35913,josh,How was it?
35915,josh,What was...?
35917,josh,Why?
35919,josh,You're reading the book?
35921,josh,Are you serious?
35923,josh,All right.
35925,josh,"Man, and you call me a snob."
35927,josh,Anybody ask you out?
35929,josh,"So, report to me-- what did he say?"
35931,josh,What did he say?
35933,josh,I'll say.
35935,josh,Because it's not harmless in an American President.
35937,josh,Open this book to any page. 
35938,josh,"Okay, well. This is an order form to buy ""Owning Yourself,"" follow-up to the bestseller..."
35940,josh,"""It's good to be trapped in a corner. That's when you act."""
35942,josh,"It is. In my case, it's the only time that I do."
35944,josh,"It's Immanuel Kant! ""Duty! Sublime and mighty name, that embraces nothing charming or insinuating  but requires submission."" Every year a million freshman philosophy students read that sentence. "
35946,josh,"You've just got a mouth full of wiseass today, don't you?"
35948,josh,Could you locate it again?
35950,josh,"It comes from a 193-page book called ""A Critique of Practical Reason."" It's about metaphysica and  epistemology. Tomba's impressively boiled it down to two-thirds of one page. Give me another one."
35952,josh,"Right. That's from an old paperback called ""The Republic"" by Plato. Lucky Tomba's been able to  fit on fortune cookie so it suits the attention span of the Republican nominee. Here he quotes  Robert Frost. ""Good fences make good neighbors."" Did he talk about that?"
35954,josh,What did he say?
35956,josh,You had to study modern poetry.
35958,josh,Is that what Frost meant?
35960,josh,"Why did he say ""Good fences make good neighbors?"""
35962,josh,"What does this remind you of? ""I believe in hope, not fear."" ""I'm a leader, not a politician.""  ""It's time for an American leader."" ""America's earned a change."" ""I before 'E' except after 'C'!""  It's the fortune-cookie candidacy! These are important thinkers, and understanding them can be  very useful and it's not ever going to happen at a four-hour seminar. When the President's got  an embassy surrounded in Haiti, or a keyhole photograph of a heavy water reactor, or any of the  fifty life-and-death matters that walk across his desk every day, I don't know if he's thinking  about Immanuel Kant or not. I doubt it, but if he does, I am comforted at least in my certainty  that he is doing his best to reach for all of it and not just the McNuggets. Is it possible we  would be willing to require any less of the person sitting in that chair? The low road? I don't  think it is."
35964,josh,"Yeah, make sure you..."
35966,josh,A guy named Fern?
35968,josh,You sure it wasn't Vern?
35970,josh,Let me know when the report gets in.
35971,leo,"Hey, Sam."
35972,sam,What's wrong with the other door?
35973,leo,I don't know. You close it and it's locking by itself. What's up?
35974,sam,Do you know who Horton Wilde is?
35975,leo,That name sounds familiar. He's running in Orange County.
35976,sam,Yeah. He's in the hospital. He's had a heart attack.
35977,leo,I'm sorry to hear that. We'll send something.
35978,sam,"It's his fourth. In the Idaho 2nd we're running a guy who lost the race for city council. In the  Texas 22nd our candidate's an electrical engineer who paid his filing fee by dumping the cash out  of a cigar box. The Arizona 6th features a Democrat who nine weeks ago, registered as... a Democrat."
35979,leo,You just named three districts that are impossible for Democrats. Finding qualified sacrificial  lambs ain't easy.
35980,sam,"When the D-Triple-C tries to raise money by saying ""We're taking back the House""? It doesn't appear  as if we're giving it all we got."
35981,leo,"This is it. We're putting our resources where they'll do the most good.   This is Leo McGarry. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah, can someone fax that over? Thank you."
35982,sam,We didn't get the five.
35983,leo,No.
35984,sam,Three?
35985,leo,Two.
35986,sam,Two?
35987,leo,"Yeah. Margaret! Would you let Josh, Toby and C.J. know that the report came out? It's two debates  and I'm here."
35988,sam,They give you a reason?
35989,leo,They're faxing it over.
35990,sam,"Don't we want one debate alone on new global threats? I guess, I mean, doesn't everybody want  one debate...?"
35991,leo,I don't know. Do you read much internatinal news?
35992,sam,Herald Tribune. Whatever C.J. puts in front of me. Agence-France.
35993,leo,Then you've read that Qumar's reopened the investigation into Abdul Shareef's plane going down.
35994,sam,Yeah. Watch. They're going to say Israel had something to do with it.
35995,leo,Do you think they did?
35996,sam,What do I know? Shareef was a bad guy. Feels like he had money in the Bahji cell.
35997,leo,He did. He was also behind the plot to blow up the Golden Gate Bridge.
35998,sam,Bridges and tunnels. That's my nightmare. What's yours?
35999,leo,"Well, now it's bridges and tunnels, Sam."
36000,sam,Then my work here is done.
36001,leo,"It's that I don't know what winning looks like. What does it look like. Is it... I mean, is it  honestly the U.S. flag flying over Mecca? Is that what's going to straighten this out? And if  that's the case, why are we postponing that? What are we hoping is going happens in the meantime?"
36002,sam,That somebody will think of something before we have to do the unthinkable.
36003,leo,You're one of the big minds of your generation. Have you thought of anything yet? 
36004,sam,No.
36005,leo,Neither have I. Neither has the Preisdent of the United States-- also a pretty good mind.
36006,sam,The Golden Gate Bridge?
36007,leo,Yeah.
36008,sam,"Leo, we didn't have anything to do with Shareef's plane going down, do we? "
36009,sam,Sorry. Two debates?
36010,leo,Yeah. The President and Bruno aren't going to take it well.
36011,sam,There's actually one person who's going to take it worse.
36012,leo,Who?
36013,sam,It's locked or something. Don't try to force it. I'm going to try...
36014,toby,Two debates.
36015,sam,"Oh, good."
36016,leo,Yeah.
36017,toby,Did they say why?
36018,leo,They're faxing over their statement and having their press conference Monday.
36019,toby,"""Giving the inability of the two major..."" Do you mind that I'm reading this?"
36020,leo,Would it matter?
36021,toby,"""...the two major parties to agree upon earlier Commission proposals, the uncertainty caused by  recent Court rulings, and the shortened time period in which to schedule debates for maximum  viewing, the Commission hereby amends..."" He got exactly what he wanted! For dragging his feet!"
36022,leo,"Well, that's why he did it. You can't fault him for having a winning strategy."
36023,toby,I'm not faulting him; I'm faulting them.
36024,leo,I'll be back in a minute.
36025,bartlet,"Leo, they did it."
36026,leo,What?
36027,bartlet,Casper's boys.
36028,leo,"Hey, really?"
36029,bartlet,One suspect... you should tell him.
36030,bartlet,Wounded in the leg. That's it.
36031,bartlet,Our guys are fine.
36032,bartlet,"And? Come on, and..."
36033,leo,And the kid?
36034,bartlet,He's...
36035,bartlet,"Univerisy Hospital. Stable condition. Mike, pick yourself out a daughter. My oldest is married,  but I can have it annulled. The Pope said he'd do it, I swear to God."
36036,bartlet,"Jerry, ws that note anything I need?"
36037,bartlet,Where did it originate?
36038,leo,He is.
36039,bartlet,Okay. Somebody will keep me posted.
36040,bartlet,"Mike? No kidding, thank you."
36041,leo,"Ben Yosef's plane is missing. Now, how did I not see that coming?"
36042,bartlet,"Yeah, call that play on first down again, Coach 'cause I'm sure they're not ready for it this time.  You know, if you ask a professional athlete what the hardest thing is to do in sports, they'll all  say ""hit a baseball."" But a coach once told me that the hardest thing to do in sports is to walk  into your Super Bowl locker room at half-time and change the strategy that got you there 'cause  it's no longer working."
36043,c.j.,"It's really okay that after almost every play, somebody requires medical attention?"
36044,bartlet,"It's not even the number of debates, as much as the format. 2 minute response followed by a 1  minute reply. That's not a debate. That's not a debate! It's a joint press conference."
36045,sam,"Good evening, Mr. President."
36046,bartlet,"Nice job on the Red Mass. First rate.You don't mind if I change everything, do you?"
36047,sam,"No, sir."
36048,bartlet,Here... here... and I added a section here.
36049,sam,Ah! Cute. Let's take a look. 
36050,bartlet,It's a joint press conference. It's not neccesary for the candidates to be in the same room.  That part's just theater.
36051,c.j., We're talking about ways to possibly lower expectations.
36052,sam,I like what you did. I like the 80-20.
36053,bartlet,"Be nice to be able to respond to what the other person has said, and ask them a question. And  the moderator should be empowered to press for an answer, just as a judge can of a witness,  or a member of Congress in a confirmation hearing."
36054,sam,Hmm.
36055,c.j.,"Sam, what do you think about me writing you an urgent memo? ""I think Ritchie's a more skilled  debater than we're anticipating. He has, after all, debated three gubernatorial candidates and  won each time."" "
36056,sam,And leak the memo?
36057,c.j.,Yeah.
36058,sam,I think you'll look silly.
36059,c.j.,I'm used to that.
36060,sam,I don't think it'll do much.
36061,c.j.,"Me, neither."
36062,bartlet,"Cicero wanted to restore the overthrown king of Egypt, and the Roman Senate debated all day and  into the night, every military and diplomatic consequence until they collapsed on the Senate floor.  Lentulus is trying to overthrow the Republic. Ceaser goes up against Cato-- by the way, in the very  first public debate on the death penalty. They were against each other, it was a debate and they  explored the meaning of spirituality and suffering."
36063,sam,And then they put Lentulus to death.
36064,bartlet,"That's right, but my point..."
36065,c.j.,Why not?
36066,bartlet,"Why not, what?"
36067,c.j.,"Ask for a different format. We didn't get the number of debates we wanted, so why not ask for a  different format?"
36068,bartlet,We'd never get it.
36069,c.j.,We might.
36070,bartlet,The Ritchie people wold put up too much of a fight.
36071,c.j.,They might consider it. The might consider it if we give them something else they wanted.
36072,bartlet,"Other then this House, we don't have anything else they want."
36073,sam,"Sure we do. Sure we do. We wanted five debates, they wanted none. We have exactly one thing  left that they want."
36074,bartlet,Wow. Isn't this exactly why casino's don't play with a one-deck shoe?
36075,sam,Yes.
36076,bartlet,Hmm...
36077,bartlet,"He's still running that screen pass. Get Toby to sign off, and I'm in."
36078,bartlet,This is going to be interesting. Do I need my speech?
36079,bartlet,"And so how isn't it a Constitutional issue? It is, but sometimes you say, ""Big deal."" It was  the intention not to have a national religion, not to have anyone's religious views imposed  on anyone else, and not to have the government encourage a national display of piety as a  substitute for real action. I'll be in the office a minute."
36080,josh,"Yeah, let me ask you another. With a runner on first who's a threat to steal, why don't you..."
36081,josh,Okay.
36082,josh,Hey.
36083,josh,What are you doing here?
36084,josh,What are you doing here?
36085,josh,No... No.
36086,josh,"Can you give me any indication, what's the senator's thinking?"
36087,josh,What?
36088,josh,Why?
36089,josh,Look...
36090,josh,What is it?
36091,sam,"I was thinking about what you asked me before, about have I been able to think of anything and  I said, ""No."" And you said, ""Neither have I or neither has the President."""
36092,leo,What about it?
36093,sam,"I wouldn't speak for anybody else but you know I'm not done yet, right?"
36094,c.j.,Toby...
36095,toby,Nope. Stay there. I'm first looking for something to beat you with.
36096,c.j.,Look...
36097,toby,I'm going to do it with my hands.
36098,c.j.,Let me tell you something.
36099,toby,One debate?
36100,c.j.,What's really the difference between one debate and two debates?
36101,toby,What's the difference betw...? It's a whole other debate. It's a second debate! It's 100% more debate!
36102,c.j.,"Someone should ask him if he's aware taxpayers pay $9,000 this instead of $200,000 that.  And somebody should ask him what he means by, and somebody should ask him how he plans on...""  You said that, and you were right!"
36103,toby,"What if he has a bad night? It's happened. What if he gets himself into trouble? What if Ritchie  comes after Abbey or the kids and the President goes postal? That's what I'd try to do. Stress,  hot lights... What if he has an episode?"
36104,c.j.,"We lose. When you can't lower expectations, you only have one thing you can do. You have to meet them."
36105,toby,Clear 24 hours from the President's schedule. We're going away.
36106,c.j.,Susan.
36107,c.j.,"Well, I don't know, Susan."
36108,c.j.,Okay.
36109,bartlet,Thank you. I didn't write much of it.
36110,bartlet,That part I wrote. I added it.
36111,bartlet,"You did, Howard. You did all the time."
36112,bartlet,No. C.J.?
36113,c.j.,"Yes, sir?"
36114,bartlet,Would it be possible to move the press off the church grounds? I'm going to take questions for  a little while.
36115,c.j.,On what?
36116,bartlet,Needle exchange.
36117,c.j.,"Yes, sir."
36118,c.j.,If you'll move off the church grounds. Just move back.
36119,bartlet,Affirmative action and quotas are about two different things. Affirmative action is about  providing people an opportunity they might not otherwise get.
36120,sam,"I don't know how you can talk about providing opportunity, while at the same time supporting  racial profiling."
36121,bartlet,What that hell is...? I don't support racial profiling.
36122,sam,Your nominee for Attorney General did. Can you tell us why you nominated him?
36123,bartlet,Why?
36124,sam,Yes.
36125,bartlet,"'Cause bite me, that's why."
36126,c.j.,It's a legitamate question.
36127,bartlet,"It's been almost four years Sam, how long do you want to say ""I told you so?"""
36128,josh,"He wasn't saying ""I told you so,"" sir. We need an answer on Rooker."
36129,bartlet,"What wrong with ""bite me?"""
36130,josh,I think we'd lose.
36131,toby,Not in New Jersey. 
36132,c.j.,"""It's never been shown that racial profiling works, and I'm against it."""
36133,josh,"That answer's pretty simple, isn't it?"
36134,c.j.,We can make it more complicated.
36135,josh,No...
36136,bartlet,"I think she was talking to me there, Dexter. What?"
36137,bartlet,I'm against it.
36138,bartlet,How you doing there Joey? Kippy?
36139,josh,Kenny.
36140,bartlet,Okay.
36141,bartlet,"Is that what you were saying, Andy?"
36142,c.j.,"Yeah, but Richie will bring it back to Rooker and the fact that you don't know what your  position on racial profiling..."
36143,bartlet,I do know what my position is.
36144,toby,"We're losing the question. Fundamentally, it's ""What was the story with Rooker?"""
36145,c.j.,We gave him our full support until it became clear that an increasingly divided Congress  was going to shoot down our nominee.
36146,toby,We didn't give him our full support. We withdrew the nomination.
36147,josh,Why not blow past the nomination fight and give a strong...
36148,c.j.,Blow past the nomination fight?
36149,josh,"...and give a strong, unambiguous statement in support of law enforcement?"
36150,toby,'Cause that's not going to be the vote.
36151,josh,"Nobody's for stronger, fairer law enforcement."
36152,toby,That's not going to be the question.
36153,sam,"Why not just say we screwed up? (imitating Bartlet) ""Mr. Rooker's a devoted crimer fighter--  we had our differences-- but on this, all Americans can agree..."""
36154,bartlet,Excuse me...
36155,sam,...Yes sir?
36156,bartlet,Were you doing me just then?
36157,sam,I was offering an answer...
36158,bartlet,You were doing me.
36159,sam,"I may have slipped into it, yes."
36160,bartlet,"Anybody else do a pretty good Bartlet? It's talent night here at Debate Camp, anybody want to  do a little skit? "
36161,bartlet,"Apparently, eight Israeli Thunder fighters--these are also known as American-made Boeing F15E  Strike Eagles--have hit two terrorist bases in the north and south of Qumar. And while no Qumari  government personel or institutions were destroyed, Qumar, of course, considers an attack on its  soil to be an act of war. So we are, as always, one bad bottle of Tequila away from all-out war  in West Asia. (to Sam) Would you like to take this one or shall I?"
36162,sam,Why don't you get this one. I'll get... the next one.
36163,bartlet,Okay.
36164,leo,We've got a secure link.
36165,bartlet,(leaving room) I agreed to be locked up with you people for 48 hours. How much time do I  have left?
36166,leo,"47 hours, 41 minutes."
36167,leo,Hutchinson and Berryhill are hooked in along with Nancy and Fitzwallace and we're still  getting Peter from State.
36168,bartlet,Defense condition three for the bases in Qumar is what?
36169,leo,Mike
36170,bartlet,What's happening on the ground?
36171,bartlet,That was fast.
36172,leo,They're not there yet.
36173,bartlet,"Alright. Well, we've got ourselves a Marx Brothers' movie."
36174,bartlet,"You have the order. Oh, Fitz."
36175,bartlet,How're you doing?
36176,bartlet,"Well, we've made camp in North Carolina for prep, so I've been thinking about killing myself,  but let me ask you something. Besides Qumar, Iran, Syria, Hezbullah, they've all got short  and medium-range missiles. If Israel feels threatened by them, what happens?"
36177,leo,"Yeah, but before that happens, Qumar shows its teeth, right?"
36178,leo,Yeah. So what happens then?
36179,bartlet,"Well, for the moment, they haven't stood up, but in the meantime, let's think of something  we can give them when they do."
36180,leo,(angrily) That's what we should do in the meantime?
36181,bartlet,(warning tone) Leo...
36182,leo,We should think of something we can *give* them?!
36183,bartlet,"Honey, if we're going to have this fight, can we not do it in front of the Joint Chiefs?  It just scares the hell out of them."
36184,leo,Yes.
36185,bartlet,"Mr. Chairman, would you put our bases in Qumar at Defense Condition 3 with the U.S. Military  at Defcon Four?"
36186,bartlet,Thank you. 
36187,toby,Andy...
36188,toby,A couple of things. I need you to look at a couple of answers on defense readiness. I need  concrete examples of waste in Pentagon procurement. We need two more members of the IRC for  post spin. I need you to fill out this marriage license and paperwork for a joint checking  account and review this 60-second answer on Rwanda.
36189,toby,"See, by my count, you said under no circumstances to the IRC post spin and sure...."
36190,toby,May I ask why?
36191,toby,"Yes, well..."
36192,toby,"Hey, that was good, Sam. Stay up in his face. Don't back off."
36193,sam,You want to shoot for two minutes? There's a hoop in the back.
36194,toby,Yeah.
36195,josh,He's right. Don't back off.
36196,sam,Yeah. (to Toby) What's going on with you and Andy?
36197,toby,Nothing.
36198,sam,I think you're wrong.
36199,toby,I'm not.
36200,sam,I think you're getting back together.
36201,toby,We're not.
36202,sam,But you want to.
36203,toby,Yes.
36204,sam,I think... Wait. What?
36205,toby,"See, sometimes if I slam on the brakes, you run right past."
36206,josh,"Okay, fill us in on everything you've got so far between the two of you."
36207,toby,"(sarcastically) Yeah, that's what's going to happen right now. "
36208,sam,"Well, if you do that..."
36209,toby,Are you going to stay up in his face?
36210,sam,Did you hear me say I would?
36211,toby,"No, actually."
36212,sam,"Well, I will. Listen, let me tell you something. What I said wasn't personal."
36213,toby,Who said it was?
36214,sam,"He did. He said, ""It's been four years and when am I going to stop saying, 'I told you so?'""  And that wasn't... I was... Let's say we're new. We made mistakes. We'd just gotten to...  We weren't even in the White House when we heard Rooker. It was like January 5."
36215,toby,(with certainty) It was the 15th. It was January 15th.
36216,sam,How do you remember?
36217,toby,I just do.
36218,leo,I think Cornell Rooker's going to be the AG. How about that?
36219,toby,What do you mean?
36220,leo,He's on the phone with the governor right now.
36221,sam,We're settled on that?
36222,leo,"Yeah, it's Cornell Rooker, if that's what he's saying on the phone. If he's saying no,  then it's going to be somebody else."
36223,josh,Well analyzed.
36224,sam,I thought there might be more conversations about the more conservative tendancies.
36225,leo,Like privacy?
36226,sam,Yeah.
36227,c.j.,(walks in) He's a Democrat with a record the right win can't complain about. (sits)
36228,josh,"Donna is at the White House, as a matter of fact."
36229,c.j.,(surprised) She's at the White House?!
36230,josh,Yup.
36231,c.j.,"She knows the old tenants are still there, right?"
36232,josh,"She's being taken out to lunch by her predecessor, a guy who's the assistant to Mac McConnell,  the assistant to the Deputy C.O.S."
36233,c.j.,Nobody did that with me. (to Leo) Anybody do that with you?
36234,leo,(shakes his head) Sam...
36235,josh,(interrupts) He's who the judiciary calls when they want to put a stamp on a yes. He has a  record conservatives can't complain about.
36236,sam,"Folks, our opponent had a record conservatives can't complain about, but he lost."
36237,toby,Yeah?
36238,toby,"Yeah. (irritated) Congresswoman Wyatt is also Mrs. Ziegler. Just... uh, I'll be right out."
36239,toby,You think we're going to get hit from the left?
36240,sam,I do.
36241,josh,I don't.
36242,sam,Look...
36243,josh,He gets a honeymoon. Let's take advantage.
36244,sam,You're missing the point.
36245,josh,What?
36246,sam,I think he'll be confirmed. We might even get the honeymoon from the left.
36247,josh,But?
36248,sam,I'm not sure he's the right guy.
36249,bartlet,(enters) We got Rooker. 
36263,toby,Everything alright?
36264,toby,(wary) Why?
36265,toby,Can we maybe talk about this over here? 
36266,toby,A blackout in Alexandria? 
36267,toby,"No it's not no sweat. In fact, it's a bit gruesome."
36268,toby,"It's... something. You get off on the 4th floor, which is clearly marked for all the other  passengers on the elevator to read that it's the fertility clinic. And you're trying to show  with your body language that it's not you and that's impossible to show with body language.  An 84-year-old Welsh nurse hands you a brown paper bag with a cup and a video and points you  toward a room, where I won't even tell you the name they have for this room."
36269,toby,I won't tell you.
36270,toby,"It's not a good out loud word. You take the longest walk of your life back to the Welsh nurse,  who takes the cup out of the bag and says, ""Very nice."""
36271,toby,Can't it possibly wait until next week...
36272,toby,"(snaps angrily) It's January 15th, Andy. I can't have a baby today. He's getting sworn in five  days. I'm not saying never. I'm saying, can we wait five days?"
36273,toby,Rooker's going to be the AG. 
36274,toby,Yeah?
36275,toby,I'm sorry?
36276,josh,Electoral math.
36277,josh,When do you suppose Georgia got so far out of reach? Was it 'cause we... burned it down?
36278,sam,I was going to say.
36279,toby,How much money is it going to take to win there?
36280,toby,"I'm going to stop you there. Joey, I-I can't go to him with it."
36281,c.j.,"No, I'm with Toby. I don't think you understand how the President feels about his home state.  He's a New Hampshire Bartlet. It's been home for centuries. He's a Democrat elected to the  statehouse with close to 60% and the fact that the state's in play is a real embarrasment for  him. He doesn't want to campaign there because that's embarassing too, but we really can't..."
36282,josh,"Joey, no kidding-- if you asked the President which he'd rather win, New Hampshire or the  election, he'd have to think before he answered. Put a pin in it; we'll come back after prep.  Thanks."
36283,josh,We're trying this again. Sorry.
36284,bartlet,"Well, that's an extraordinary and unsurprisingly dumb interpretation of what it is my  administration's trying to accomplsh. "
36285,bartlet,"It's hard enought to rasie kids today with help from family leave, subsidized daycare, preschool--  we need more of it, not less."
36286,sam,"The government can't raise kids, Mr. President-- parents have to."
36287,bartlet,"I have three grown daughters, Governor. You really want to tell me how I should raise my family?  You're really comfortable with that?"
36288,josh,There it is.
36289,bartlet,You want to tell other American fathers and mothers what they're doing wrong?
36290,sam,"Sir, I did not say..."
36291,bartlet,"I didn't think you did. So, why don't we stick to what government can do-- which is collect money  and distribute it-- and stop wasting time by sentimentalizing family."
36292,sam,We just lost the vote of every stay-at-home mom and their husbands who are henpecked.
36293,bartlet,Who are you now?
36294,sam,"Yes, sir."
36295,toby,I like the aggressive answer. It's just right.
36296,bartlet,"That wasn't the question, Larry. The question was, ""What do I have against families?"" and  the answer is I have nothing against them at all."
36297,c.j.,Josh...
36298,bartlet,They simply aren't mentioned in the Executive Powers section.
36299,c.j.,"Larry's right, we have to put him on the right side of this. He is on the right side of this,  but we need help with the answer."
36300,josh,"You're asking me to do that which I don't want to do, right?"
36301,c.j.,Yes.
36302,josh,Okay.
36303,c.j.,I have a press briefing.
36304,c.j.,Good afternoon. Today is January 22nd. Let me brief you on the President's morning schedule.  He started with... How's that?
36305,c.j.,Yeah?
36306,c.j.,You sure?
36307,c.j.,You don't care.
36308,c.j.,Okay.
36309,c.j.,I'm going to stay here and practice.
36310,c.j.,"No, David, the President was very clear about that. Mark, then Katie. Mark, Katie, Jessie,  Phil, Steve, Betsy, Julie, Julie, Julia, Kevin, Paul, Tom, Sondra, Suzanne... (sighs) Mike,  Danny... Elizabeth. 18th seat. 18 you can vote... ""vote"" sounds like ""moat""... which is a  trench-- Trent."
36311,c.j.,Yeah?
36312,c.j.,I can do better.
36313,c.j.,Really?
36314,c.j.,I don't understand.
36315,c.j.,I really don't know what to say in response to that sort of kindness.
36316,c.j.,Like what?
36317,c.j.,I think the President's pretty much made up his mind.
36318,c.j.,"Yes, but we got as many as we needed for now, so..."
36319,c.j.,I'll see you around.
36320,c.j.,Really?
36321,bartlet,It's nice.
36322,bartlet,What are we doing right now?
36323,bartlet,They'll loan stuff?
36324,bartlet,Really?
36325,bartlet,I want Apollo 11.
36326,bartlet,Then don't bother me.
36327,bartlet,"I'm meeting with the leadership, I'm signing six Executive Orders I don't yet understand..."
36328,leo,Mr. President.
36329,bartlet,"God, I thought that was a closet."
36330,leo,It's my office!
36331,bartlet,"All right, the rooms got four doors, it's huge."
36332,leo,I want to run through these Executive Orders.
36333,bartlet,Do you understand them?
36334,leo,Not quite yet.
36335,bartlet,"C.J., what are you doing?"
36336,c.j.,"I'm sorry, sir. I just wanted to see Leo."
36337,bartlet, He's standing right there.
36338,c.j.,Yeah.
36339,bartlet,Would you get your ass in here? Could everyone stop acting strange?
36340,leo,What's up?
36341,c.j.,"A reporter for a conservative Christian magazine introduced himself and happened to serve on  a city counsel with Rooker, which is true-- it was in Miami."
36342,bartlet,Yeah.
36343,c.j.,The reporter said that he liked Rooker's position on racial profiling.
36344,leo,That's strange.
36345,c.j.,"No, it's not. We found the transcript. ""I'm not saying it should be active policy, but there  is no question in my mind that in certain situations, racial profiling can be helpful to law..."""
36346,bartlet,Law enforcement?
36347,c.j.,Yeah.
36348,bartlet,"It's our second day, how do you think it's going so far?"
36349,leo,We'll get into it.
36350,bartlet,Yes.
36351,josh,It's Josh.
36352,josh,You're breathing very hard.
36353,josh,Then what are you doing?
36354,josh,Yeah.
36355,josh,How's Peter's wife?
36356,josh,"Yes, I know."
36357,josh,How do we stand strong for the modern family in all its quirks and not seem like we're dissing  everyone born before 1962?
36358,josh,You'll think about it?
36359,josh,Thank you.
36360,josh,You're going to this meeting?
36361,sam,Yeah.
36362,josh,"WW-160, you been able to find it?"
36363,sam,I don't even know where I am right now.
36364,josh,I'm looking on this side again.
36365,sam,Do you mind if I talk to you while we walk?
36366,josh,"Well, we may as well get used to having meetings in the corridors from now on. It may be our  only hope. I know now why they made the Oval Office a special shape."
36367,sam,"Six new editorials-- NAACP, the Urban League, La Raza..."
36368,josh,NAACP doesn't want to see a black Attorney General?
36369,sam,"No, I think they do, but they also stand for the ones who get pulled over for having too nice a car."
36370,josh,Thank you.
36371,sam,Intergovernmental's also...
36372,josh,I'm talking to intergovernmental. Does anybody know where WW-160 is?! Hi. I'm Josh Lyman. You all  work for me. Does anybody know where WW-160 is?
36373,josh,"That one hasn't seen it. She's... you know, she's keeping an eye out though."
36374,sam,"I don't think he's going to be confirmed. I think the first thing that's going to happen to us  is we're going to lose the confirmation battle... And spend the next four years with two outs  and a full count. If we pull him out now, it's a story for a day and a half, until we announce  the next guy. If we wait a week..."
36375,josh,This is the guy. This is the story.
36376,sam,Good. 'Cause you know why? 'Cause hubris always wins in the end. The Greeks taught us that.
36377,josh,We were looking for West Wing 160.
36378,leo,"Yeah, I think it's in the Kremlin. Let's just meet here."
36379,josh,"Leo, this is a strong deserving nominee. Sam, it's not hubris. He should be Attorney General."
36380,sam,"Yeah, but he's not going to be. So let's take it from there."
36381,leo,"No, the President doesn't want to give it up yet."
36382,toby,"Let's line up people for IP, the mornings... ""Cornell Rooker has an exceptional record as a  U.S. attorney... a leader in fighting employment discrimination...was college chair of...  He's tough on crime, he's fair on justice."" That's the line. Say that. Do not say that. What  the hell was that? ""He's tough on crime, he's fair on justice."" Sings a song, has a moustache?  What is that supposed to..."
36383,c.j.,Toby's gone to the zoo.
36384,leo,"Yeah, I think we may have killed these two guys with Inauguration."
36385,sam,"Leo, I beseech you-- let me take a pass at some remarks the President can make withdrawing  the nomination. We're going to do it anyway, let's do it now."
36386,josh,"Here it is. ""Take a thorough look at Cornell Rooker's record, you'll see..."
36387,toby,Yes.
36388,josh,"...he's fought for justice his entire carer. If you take a thorough look at Cornell Rooker  record, you'll see he's fought for justice his entire career."""
36389,toby,I don't want to be able to turn my head tomorrow without reading that quote.
36390,josh,Anything else?
36391,leo,No.
36392,josh,Thank you.
36394,josh,"Yeah, hey. How do you do?"
36396,josh,"Guess what I have here. It's a copy of ""21 Magazine."" It's for ""Generation Now!"""
36398,josh,Yuh-huh.
36400,josh,"""In sleek Celia Yang slacks and a classic DKNY button-down, she's not afraid to bring a note of  'Let's do drinks after work' to the office."" "
36402,josh,"""But as much as we love her style, we worry about her inexperience and Bambi-esque naivete.  'There's so much to learn,' says Moss. 'I didn't even know there was a nuclear missile silo  under this place.'"""
36404,josh,There's not!
36406,josh,Who told you that?
36408,josh,"Let me take a guess at something. Jeff set you up with a reporter, right?"
36410,josh,"You probably didn't even bring this up, right? The girlfriend led you there?"
36412,josh,"As does pertain to Bambi. There's a reason why we keep these missile silos way out the hell  in the middle nowhere. It's 'cause they're working with some pretty nasty materials. Also,  there's not much point in keeping nuclear secrets from China when all they have to do is take  the free tour. Did it really sound right to you, when he said it? What'd you think, we'd go  to war, and Hercules rockets come flying out of the Rose Garden?"
36414,josh,"Oh, my God!"
36416,josh,"This is just like when I played the lead in ""Li'l Abner"" in eighth grade and rehearsals are  going fine. All of a sudden there's sets and lights and costumes, and everyone's tripping all  over themselves except me. You guys all walked into the building and got freaked by the lights.  I walked in and, you know, something else happened."
36418,josh,You all can try a little harder to be.
36420,josh,I should be sitting at my desk right now. Do I have a desk yet?
36422,josh,Okay. Then I'll just... walk around some more... see if I can get into a pickup meeting.
36423,toby,Yeah?
36424,toby,Yeah.
36425,toby,"Okay, but I-I don't know what you're talking about."
36426,toby,With what?
36427,toby,"See, I lent voice to thought and that was my mistake."
36428,toby,Okay.
36429,toby,I get it.
36430,toby,I think you have a different motivation.
36431,toby,Yes.
36432,toby,Yes.
36433,toby,Yes.
36434,toby,This is excruciating.
36435,toby,Why?
36436,toby,"No, wha... uh... What's the matter with your white blood cells?"
36437,toby,"You don't have to sell me. It sounds like something we should try... But let me ask you  something, and bear in mind that I'm happy, I'm... eager to go to as many doctors as there  are... but should we talk about a stop date?"
36438,toby,"Yeah, we can talk about adopting."
36439,toby,"I meant adopting. I meant surrogacy. And yes, I love kids and I want them and I don't have  to have them. And I don't have to have them..."
36440,toby,And I'm there.
36441,toby,No kidding.
36442,c.j.,Is he in there?
36443,c.j.,No...
36444,c.j.,There's a problem.
36445,toby,I just said a stupid thing. What's the problem?
36446,c.j.,"Well, I did a one-on-one with Danny Concannon a few days ago on Rooker."
36447,toby,"Did you say, ""If you take a thorough look at Cornell Rooker's record...?"""
36448,c.j.,"Yes, as a matter of fact."
36449,toby,And?
36450,c.j.,He did.
36451,toby,"Oh, man."
36452,c.j.,A DUI got fixed in law school. He doesn't want to write about the DUI as much as he wants to  write about us being the Capitol Clampettes. What was the stupid thing that you said?
36453,toby,Doesn't matter. Let's fix this.
36454,sam,It's an old camp song.
36455,sam,"""Let us be merry, therefore while we are young men. After the joys of youth, after the pains  of old age, the ground will have us."" It's true."
36456,sam,New Hampshire?
36457,sam,By coming out with me.
36458,sam,The President's got to spend a little more time in congressional districts we're not going to win.
36459,sam,"To build Democratic momentum in the very places we traditionally tank. We're running comically weak  candidates in these districts. The Tennessee 7th, Horton Wilde in Orange County; he's in the hospital  with his fourth heart attack. Who the hell knows when he's going to resume a campaign schedule."
36460,sam,That's a resonable point.
36461,sam,Yeah.
36462,josh,"Listen, you probably don't want to let him know it's me on the phone. It's too intimidating.  It's like going out with Cher and Sonny calls."
36463,josh,Any thoughts?
36464,josh,So a radical feminist is saying women should stay home with the kids?
36465,josh,But everybody kills themself in Scandinavia.
36466,josh,"We need to defend our accomplishments on work and family, many of which you pushed for and show  that we get what working parents are going through. Can you help us?"
36467,josh,I'll call back. What would be a really bad time?
36468,josh,Outstanding.
36470,josh,Yeah?
36472,josh,Does he have an appointment?
36474,josh,NSA? Send him in.
36475,josh,Yeah.
36476,josh,Donna says you're with the NSA.
36477,josh,"Yeah, but you wouldn't tell me of you were, right?"
36478,josh,What's the trouble?
36479,josh,"Yeah, look, the old guys were playing a joke on her. I realize it's not a good idea for a White  House staffer to be saying there's a missile in the capitol."
36480,josh,What do you mean?
36481,josh,"""She hit a little close to home""?"
36482,josh,You trying to tell me...?
36483,josh,Yeah.
36484,josh,"Listen, this... this is silly. She was just duped. It was a joke."
36485,josh,This is a giant misunderstanding.
36486,josh,I would vouch for Donna with my life. She doesn't know about missiles. She's from Wisconsin!
36487,josh,"No, look, I'm sorry. I'm sure your intentions are good, and this is just routine, but it could  get tricky, and I'd like to have her talk to someone."
36488,josh,Yeah.
36489,josh,She's my assistant. For how long?
36490,josh,All right.
36491,josh,Donna...
36493,josh,You got to go home.
36495,josh,"That idiot interview you did, pooped a red flag at NSA. They're revoking your credentials  until it's straightened out."
36497,josh,I'm talking to someone in Cochran's office.
36499,josh,Take a few days off. Go home. Go to the beach.
36501,josh,"Well, then, I wouldn't go to the beach."
36503,josh,Don't worry about this. I'm going to fix this.
36504,c.j.,The President's not going to be available for a little bit.
36505,josh,Why?
36506,c.j.,Fitzwallace just got here.
36507,josh,Any idea what's going on? 
36508,josh,"All right. Listen up. We still have an open question on family, we still have an open question  on Rooker, missile defense, and vouchers. We start dress rehearsals tomorrow at 3:00. Let's  split up in our groups. I really want vouchers by 10:00, missile defense by 11:00."
36509,sam,"Anybody not doing anything at midnight-- Team Toby, my cabin."
36510,toby,Good.
36511,josh,Break's over.
36512,bartlet,Thanks for coming down.
36513,leo,What's going on?
36514,leo,Is it carrying Qumari arts and crafts?
36515,leo,This fires twelve warheads with 644 M-77 munitions. It does it in 60 seconds.
36516,bartlet,They turn around the ship in exchange for what?
36517,leo,"That's okay, 'cause that's just the most sophisticated anti-ballistic missile system in  history short of Star Wars. What else?"
36518,bartlet,"They're arming the Bahji, Leo. Two training camps of which the Israelis just attacked.  I've gotta turn around the boat-- tonight. Tomorrow we'll worry about tomorrow."
36519,leo,"Well, we can invite the Sultan over for a mixer."
36520,bartlet,Look...
36521,leo,"A nice mixer. Punch, sack races, whatnot... Why are we playing games with these people? They  refuse to catch and prosecute the Bahji. In fact, they support them in a variety of ways.  Why isn't that the end of the conversation? ""We'll worry about tomorrow, tomorrow."" We said  that yesterday."
36522,bartlet,Fitz?
36523,bartlet,What about Nancy?
36524,bartlet,What's available from the Sixth Fleet?
36525,bartlet,Stop the boat. Don't shoot it unless I tell you to.
36526,c.j.,"This doesn't feel food, does it? It's quiet, you know. It's too quiet."
36527,c.j.,Yeah.
36528,leo,The President has withdrawn Rooker's name from nomination.
36529,sam,"Well, at least it's behind us."
36530,leo,"Not quite. Our report card for our first two weeks in office. The President's approval has  gone from 61% during the transition-- when, I suppose, there's nothing to approve-- to 49%  once there was. 47% see him as a strong leader-- a result of bungling the Rooker nomination--  and African-American support, which basically elected him, has gone from 92 to 78. Finally,  if the election were held today, the President would be Chairman of the Economics Department  at Phillips Andover Academy. Can anyone report anything good?"
36531,c.j.,"600,000 Evangelicals are praying for me... so... we have that going for us."
36532,leo,What the hell are yoy talking about?
36533,c.j.,"It's true-- a guy gave me this card: ""365 in Media."""
36534,sam,Who are the others?
36535,c.j.,"I don't know, let's see... ""Hugh Hefner, Don Imus, Howard Stern..."" all the late-night guys.  This is... one, two, three... this is the Editorial Board of The New York Times. This isn't a  good list, this is a list of people who are going to hell!"
36536,toby,Yes.
36537,c.j.,They're not praying for me because they like me! It's 'cause I'm doomed to eternal damnation!
36538,sam,"Well, if you weren't, it'd be a waste of praying."
36539,c.j.,"You're on the list too, pal."
36540,sam,Can I see that?
36541,leo,You can all leave.
36542,josh,"We're going to do better for you, boss."
36543,leo,Do better for him.
36544,c.j.,We will.
36545,toby,We will.
36546,josh,Sam...
36547,sam,Yeah.
36548,josh,Can you walk with me a second?
36549,sam,Yeah.
36550,josh,"Well, you were right, I was wrong."
36551,sam,"More often then not, it's going to be the other way around, so..."
36552,josh,"Thanks. Listen, I got a weird problem."
36553,sam,What?
36554,josh,"Remember Donna had lunch with Mack's assistant a few weeks ago? He told her there's a missile  silo on the grounds. She repeated it to a magazine and an NSA guy came to see me just now, and  said she struck a little close to home and they want to investigate. In the meantime, they've  revoked her credentials."
36555,sam,"""Struck to close to home."" What does that mean?"
36556,josh,It means somehow she... There's actually some kind of weapons system right here on the White  House... or... intelligence gathering... Wait a minute. This doesn't sound right.
36557,josh,Hi.
36559,josh,"It's going to be bambi, isn't it?"
36561,josh,I'm making phone calls.
36562,josh,How you doing?
36563,josh,Where are you?
36564,josh,"Well, go inside."
36565,josh,"You'll never lose me, Amy."
36566,josh,What do you have?
36567,josh,I don't believe you.
36568,josh,That was it. We got it. We'll give it a test. I'll call you back. Probably around 1:00.
36569,josh,Yeah.
36570,josh,Let's get that in the form of an answer.
36571,c.j.,We got something from Amy.
36572,toby,Good.
36573,toby,I wasn't really wondering.
36574,josh,Why don't you just do your job as a man and get that nice girl pregnant.
36575,toby,I did.
36576,josh,"Wait, what?"
36577,c.j.,What?
36578,toby,Andy's pregnant.
36579,josh,"Toby, Andy's pregnant?"
36580,toby,With twins.
36581,sam,This is incredible.
36582,josh,And they're yours?
36583,toby,Yeah.
36584,josh,Both of them?
36585,toby,I'm going downstairs.
36586,c.j.,Yeah.
36587,sam,Let's go.
36588,bartlet,Hey.
36589,sam,"Good evening, Mr. President."
36590,bartlet,Did you have a good day?
36591,sam,"Yes, sir. We haven't found the answer we like on the Rooker question yet."
36592,bartlet,"You know what I remember he said to me? He said, ""Mr. President, when I hear black footsteps  behind me, I'm scared. When I hear white footsteps, I'm not."""
36593,sam,"Well, I think we both know people who's say different. But you have to respect him for voicing  such an unpopular opinion amongst people to whom he's a leader."
36594,bartlet,"You pay for these things for such a long time. Too long, don't you think?"
36595,sam,I absolutely do... And I don't know why we struggle with it.
36596,bartlet,We made a mistake... I corrected it. I'll make more.
36597,sam,Yes. Humans can't rebut that. It's prevent defense and has the added merit of being true.
36598,bartlet,Am I going to lose New Hampshire?
36599,sam,"Yes, sir."
36600,bartlet,"I don't mind blowing the knucklehead stuff like Rooker... Rooker's not knucklehead, but...  if I'm making mistakes there, how do I know I'm not doing it when it comes to matters like  death and destruction?"
36601,sam,"Well, probably you don't, 'cause there's no manual. Sir, we expect the President to face the  world in his own way, for his own time. Also, luckily for all of us, you have better advisors  in that area than you do in domestic and political policy."
36602,bartlet,"All right. When we're done tonight, we should talk about moving money to Ohio."
36603,sam,"Yes, sir, and maybe making a stop in Orange County. You know, our candidate in the 47th  is such a dynamo that he's in the hospital with his fourth heart attack."
36604,bartlet,Not anymore. He's dead.
36605,sam,Okay.
36606,bartlet,Let's go.
36607,bartlet,"And stay up in my face, okay?"
36608,sam,"Yes, sir."
36609,bartlet,"I swear to God, the winner of this debate's going to be the next President. Anybody want  to be on the losing team?"
36610,bartlet,"Then let's pump it up. Let's go, Claudia Jean."
36611,c.j.,"Good evening, and welcome to the Presidential debate between President Josiah Bartlet and  Governor Robert Ritchie being brought to you from the Univerisity of California, San Diego.  The format agreed to by both candidates, is as follows: A candidate will have 90-seconds to  respond, followed with a 60-second questioning by his opponent, followed by 60-second  summation. By virtue of a coin toss, Mr. President, the first qestion goes to you."
36612,toby,A crisis of confidence?
36613,leo,Yeah.
36614,toby,I don't understand.
36615,leo,"I was on the helicopter with him earlier this morning, and I'm telling you he's second  guessing himself, he's revising answers in his head..."
36616,toby,Leo?
36617,leo,I know.
36618,toby,"What-what... I don't... When I left him, he was ready. I don't understand. He's ready.  You can see it."
36619,leo,Not this morning.
36620,toby,This isn't supposed to happen with you people.
36621,leo,Christians?
36622,toby,"Yes. What happened to ""steady as she goes""?"
36623,leo,A smart guy said the Presidential elections are won and lost on one square foot of real  estate.  Up here.
36624,toby,"Well, that's great."
36625,leo,Yeah.
36626,toby,"All right, we still got a day and half before he debates. We'll go back to school."
36627,leo,I think that's just going to pour gas on the problem.
36628,toby,What do you want to do?
36629,leo,"We've got a two-minute drill right now. I think whatever answers he gives we should  just say ""That's terrific, Mr. President."""
36630,toby,Then what's the point of the two-minute drill?
36631,leo,We got five of them scheduled before tomorrow night. We're using one of them for this.
36632,toby,This is crazy. I don't believe this.
36633,leo,"That's terrific, Mr. President."
36634,toby,All right.
36635,sam,Leo...
36636,toby,"Listen, we're going to do something in the... in the drill right now."
36637,sam,What?
36638,toby,"No notes, just positive reinforcement."
36639,sam,Why?
36640,toby,He has a problem this morning.
36641,sam,"All right. Leo, I've got a 9:30 flight. I'll be there sometime after lunch."
36642,leo,You really can't do this with a phone call?
36643,sam,"Oh, God, I don't know. The man died. There's a widow. We're asking them to pack.  I'm an hour and 15 minutes away in a rental car, and we didn't make it personal."
36644,leo,"All right, I just need you in San Diego."
36645,toby,Josh!
36646,leo,We're still looking for ten words.
36647,josh,"I'm still looking for them, too."
36648,leo,"Ten words, ten words-- let's go."
36649,josh,We're going to expand the field.
36650,toby,"No notes during this drill.  That's you, too."
36651,c.j.,What's that?
36652,toby,No notes during the drill.
36653,josh,Why?
36654,toby,He's in his head.
36655,josh,There's pretty important feedback in the two-minute drills.
36656,toby,We've got four more. We've got one on the plane.
36657,c.j.,When is Debbie actually starting?
36658,leo,The President sent her to the Maxwell school for a three-day crash course in everything.
36659,toby,You know you've got a ten dollar bill in there on your clipboard.
36660,c.j.,Yeah. I owe it to someone.
36661,josh,Thank you.
36662,bartlet,Ten words. Ten words.
36663,josh,"We don't have them yet, Mr. President."
36664,bartlet,"All right, let's do a drill."
36665,c.j.,"Mr. President, despite a rise in tension around the globe, you've held up funding for  a missile defense shield."
36666,bartlet,Too much money for too little protection.
36667,bartlet,Next.
36668,josh,"Sir, you oppose a voucher system that would offer children a choice of better schools..."
36669,bartlet,"That would offer some children a choice of better schools, but I haven't given up the  ghost on better schools for everybody, and vouchers drain money from that goal."
36670,toby,"Mr. President, this next question is on capital punishment, which you oppose: If your  youngest daughter Zoey was raped and murdered, would you not want to see the man  responsible put to death?"
36671,bartlet,"First of all, it's important to understand the President doesn't make that decision,  though he appoints the Supreme Court Justices who do so. What... any... um... All  right, I'm not going to say that. I'll just go right to... No, I don't. I think you  know that I'm opposed....  Let's not do that. I haven't seen any evidence that  it's a deterrent, and there are more effective... In my state... "
36672,toby,"Oh, my God."
36673,bartlet,What?
36674,toby," What's the matter with you? When I left  you... I just mentioned your daughter being murdered, and you're giving us an answer  that's not only soporific, it's barely human! Yes, you'd want to see him put to death.  You'd want it to be cruel and unusual, which is why it's probably a good idea that  fathers of murder victims don't have legal rights in these situations. Now, we're  going back to school."
36675,bartlet,Let's go-- ten bucks. Crisis of confidence.  You did one square foot of real  estate.
36676,leo,"Yes, I did."
36677,bartlet,"Ten bucks for you.  And you-- You big bear, come to me. I'm going to kiss  you right on the mouth."
36678,c.j.,Ten bucks.
36679,leo,"Anything else, sir?"
36680,bartlet,Work hard.
36681,josh, Have a safe flight.
36682,sam,I'll see you in San Diego.
36683,josh, Sorry about that. It was the President idea. He bet us you couldn't stay quiet  if he gave a bad answer. What?
36684,toby,He's ready.
36685,sam,Excuse me?
36686,sam,I'm Sam Seaborn. I'm here to see William Bailey. He's expecting me.
36687,sam,Hey... William Bailey. Bill Bailey-- I just got that.
36688,sam,Okay.
36689,sam," Merry Christmas, you 'ol Building and Loan."
36690,sam,"Well, why don't we get him?"
36691,sam,Will!
36694,sam,Sam Seaborn.
36697,sam,"I met your assistant. She's funny. She's very... She's attractive, too. I hope I'm not  being innappropriate."
36699,sam,"Oh, well, somebody who works here then."
36701,sam,"First things first. I bring the condolences of the White House on your loss. On Mrs.  Wilde's loss, I should say. Everybody's. And to tell you you ran a strong campaign on  your candidate, and you should be proud."
36703,sam,Do you know why I came here?
36705,sam,"It's not. Though you did, and you should."
36707,sam,It's over.
36709,sam,"Yes, but you can't keep campaigning without a candidate."
36711,sam,The candidate died.
36713,sam,Mr. Bailey...
36715,sam,The campaign's become embarrassing to us. It's a national joke. 
36716,sam,I'm sorry about that.
36721,sam,Will?
36723,sam,I'm here for the President.
36725,sam,But?
36727,c.j.,"All right, everyone. Thank you very much. Carol's passing out the playbooks. Senator,  we've put you on criminal justice, and Martin, we've moved you to welfare, if that's  okay."
36728,toby,"There's also some third party validator information in there, as well as the name of  the reporters you'll be handcuffed to. If it's not your thing, don't try to wing it.  Call somebody over."
36729,c.j.,Surrogate plans leaves at 9:00 this evening. We'll see you tomorrow for pre-game.
36730,toby,"C.J., could I see you? And I need Congresswoman Wyatt for just a moment."
36731,toby, Bennett's going to spin for Ritchie.
36732,c.j.,"I could have told you that was going to happen! Hang on -- no, wait -- I did!"
36733,toby,I find competitiveness so feminine in tall women.
36734,c.j.,On defense?
36735,toby,"Yeah, on defense! What the hell...?"
36736,c.j.,"Don't huckle around with me right now, Phyllis! I got a North Carolina Democrat  shilling for Ritchie on defense. I've gotta get a guy. I need a Republican."
36737,toby,This is why I'm talking to you. You're going to use Albie Duncan.
36738,c.j.,He'll do it?
36739,toby,Yes.
36740,c.j.,Duncan?
36741,toby,Yes.
36742,c.j.,He will?
36743,toby,Yes.
36744,c.j.,Look at me. He's not a little bit crazy?
36745,toby,Albie Duncan?
36746,c.j.,Yeah.
36747,toby,"No, no, no. A little bit."
36748,c.j.,Toby...
36749,toby,He's going to be great. You'll see to it. Andy?
36750,c.j.,I'm crazy about the roundness of your head. 
36751,toby,Thank you. Andy?
36752,toby,Not this one.
36753,toby,I know so.
36754,toby,That ship's sailed. Hey you want to know something? C.J. doesn't like running.
36755,toby,"Believe it or not, because it takes time away from helping. I really like that about  her, don't you?"
36756,toby,Good. Then marry me again.
36757,toby,All right. Let's make it interesting. Let's add incentive. The President wins the  debate tomorrow night and you marry me again.
36758,toby,"See, that's the difference between you and me. You're small-time. And that's why the  twins are gonna need their father around full-time. 'Cause your thing would be a  terrible trait. A terrible family trait to pass on to little... Beatrice and Bluto."
36759,toby,I need you to back up Albie Duncan.
36760,toby,"No, no, no. A little bit. No. Look, he's Albie Duncan. He was in the Eisenhower State  Department. He's brilliant, he's respected. He's a Republican. If he's crazy, then I  don't want to be sane."
36761,toby,Excellent.
36772,sam,How you doing?
36774,sam,I was about to head down there. I was just at your press conference.
36776,sam,Yeah. It's going to be great or a disaster. Nothing in between.
36778,sam,So what is this?
36780,sam,He's dead now.
36782,sam,And that's the metaphor. Standard-bearer for a party that's dead in every bedroom  community in Southern California.
36784,sam,Who?
36786,sam,You want one yet?
36788,sam,The widow?
36790,sam,Do you think you're going to need it?
36792,sam,"Give her Winston Churchill, what does it matter?  All right, it matters. What  are you doing?"
36794,sam,All right. All right. I can get on the 405 if I go straight down there right?
36796,sam,All right. You'll have more events tonight right?
36798,sam,Your tie doesn't go. 
36799,bartlet,Hey.
36800,bartlet,"No, I decided to go ahead and wear my lucky tie."
36801,bartlet,Yeah.
36802,bartlet,"Then it's your lucky tie. Why don't you get mine, and we'll go to the plane?"
36803,bartlet,"Listen, what do you say I sit in on this meeting for a few minutes. We've got time."
36804,leo,What do you say you get into pre-game. Let me worry about this for tonight.
36805,bartlet,All right.
36806,leo,Come here a second.
36807,leo,There's no such thing as too smart. There's nothing you can do that's not going to make  me proud of you. Eat 'em up. Game on.
36808,bartlet,Okay. 
36809,leo,We'll go next door. About a week ago we stopped a Qumari ship called the Mastico on  information that it was carrying about 72 tons of weapons and high explosives. 
36810,josh,Hi.
36811,leo,What do you need?
36812,josh,"Ten words. Let me try two on you. Defense: ""I will make America's defenses the strongest  in the history of the world."""
36813,leo,In the history of the world? When we say that are we comparing ourselves to the Visigoths  adjusted for inflation?
36814,josh,"Crime: ""Some crimes are so heinous, so hateful to American values that we ought to lock  prisoners up and throw away the key."" Please don't say yes to that one."
36815,leo,Keep working on the plane. And call me every 30 minutes.
36816,josh,You read Gabriel Tillman's speech at the Stanford Club?
36817,leo,No.
36818,josh,Governor of California's got a new writing staff.
36819,leo,Are you going to call every 30 minutes?
36820,josh,Yeah.
36821,leo,One more drill on the plane.
36822,josh,We're going to make you proud. Sit back and enjoy it.
36823,leo, We stopped them with a warning shot from the USS Austin.
36824,leo,An LPD San Antonio class-warship. The weapons were not on their way to the Qumari.  They were on their way to the Bahji. If I can't get everyone else on board with the  fact Qumar is our enemy surely we can agree that the international Bahji cell is.  The weapons were on their way to the Bahji. And the Austin stopped them.
36825,leo,We know this. 
36826,leo,Yesterday they want THAAD missile technology. Today they want convicted Bahji operatives  let out of US jails. It changes.
36827,leo," No! I don't have to do anything, Jordan. I'm right, they're wrong. They're  strong... I'm much stronger."
36828,leo,What happens tomorrow morning the President gets on TV and makes his case?
36829,leo,What happens?
36830,leo,Since when is it...?
36831,leo,"Well, if you're going to throw the Swiss in my face."
36832,leo,U.N. diplomats are a little under pay scale.
36833,leo,Is he? 
36834,leo,Ali Nassir is what passes for reasonable these days.
36835,leo,Not hard.
36836,leo,Margaret!
36837,leo,It's a debating phrase. It has to do with making things simpler.  Would  you get me the National Security Council?
36845,c.j.,Mr. Secretary.
36846,c.j.,Thanks so much for helping us out.
36847,c.j.,Have you ever seen the Moscow Circus?
36848,c.j.,Then I really have no point of reference to describe what a post debate spin room  is like.
36849,c.j.,Thank you very much. What happens is you'll be taken into the room and a volunteer  will walk in behind you holding up a large sign with your name on it and the press  will surround you.
36850,c.j.,Absolutely not. Don't even hope. They're going to want you to talk about why is a  Republican spinning for the President. Nobody's expecting you to say a thing-not a  thing-that would embarrass the party to which you've been a loyal and active member  your entire life. He'll be attacked during the debate on China. He'll have to defend  his trade goals versus human rights violations.
36851,c.j.,That's it. It's that simple.
36852,c.j.,Sure.
36853,c.j.,Josh?
36854,c.j.,"No, no, he's the ten-word. And believe me he hates it."
36855,c.j.,"Yeah, but the thing is Ritchie's good at it and we just need to show we have that club  in our bag. That's all."
36856,c.j.,According to the best people who've analyzed specific polling data there may a million  undecideds out there who'd come to Bartlet if he displayed one or two qualities that  were more like Ritchie. And we chose this. So for 90 seconds tonight the mountain will  come to Mohammed and we'll pretend the whole thing never happened.
36857,c.j.,Yes.
36858,c.j.,It was perfect.
36859,c.j.,Sure.
36860,c.j.,"Okay, but I wouldn't say that tonight."
36861,c.j.,"Nor, if it were I, would I say that."
36862,c.j.,"Still, I think the first answer's our winner. So, can I find an attractive aide and  have her bring you some Schweppe's Bitter Lemon?"
36863,c.j.,Good.  Carol?
36864,c.j.,Go to work.
36865,toby,So is he crazy?
36866,c.j.,"Um, yes."
36867,toby,What do you think?
36868,josh,"Well if we lose because of a ten-word answer, then I'm quitting show business.  "
36869,toby,What do you think?
36870,c.j.,"I think it depends who shows up. If it's Uncle Fluffy, we've got problems. If it's the  President, in his last campaign, his last debate, for the last job he'll ever have...  if the President shows up, I think it'll be a sight to see, I mean a sight to see.  What do you think?"
36871,toby,I think you're going to enjoy yourself tonight.
36872,leo,Mr. Ambassador.
36873,leo,You know Jordan Kendall.
36874,leo,Special Counsel to the Office of the Chief of Staff. 
36875,leo,"Mr. Nissir, the President starts his debate in four minutes. I won't be there,  obviously. And for me, it's like missing my brother's wedding, right? A big Super  Bowl or something. And I'm mentioning this to underline the importance of this  conversation. You have to turn the boat around. It's the match being held to the fuse."
36876,leo,You're not getting access to THAAD. We're not going to release Bahji operatives. You  have to turn.
36877,bartlet,I guess what I don't understand is this. Have I ever exhibited any evidence that I'd  be mad if a tie got ruined?
36878,bartlet,"No, I'm not that guy."
36879,bartlet,The chemicals at the Dry cleaner don't know that.
36880,bartlet,Josh?
36881,josh,"Yeah. Guys, we're going to give them the room now."
36882,c.j.,"Bring it, boss. "
36883,josh,Nothing but strikes. 
36884,sam,Game on. 
36885,toby,I just assumed you wanted to include me. 
36887,bartlet,My daughters are here?
36889,bartlet,"Well, I don't approve of that."
36891,bartlet,"I don't approve of that, either. Remember the tie Josh had to give me at the last minute?"
36893,bartlet,There was a lot of juice in that tie. It was like in the last seconds. Just the energy  getting me out on stage...
36895,bartlet,Yeah. I got to go.
36897,bartlet,Okay.
36899,bartlet,Why are you telling me this now?
36901,bartlet,"Oh, my God. You're insane. Are you...? You're insane! Charlie!"
36902,josh,What the hell?!
36903,c.j.,What happened?
36904,bartlet,My wife cut it off with scissors.
36905,josh,Why?
36906,bartlet,"I don't think we have that kind of time, Josh."
36907,c.j.,No one's done camera test...
36908,toby,She's right. Let's run some.
36909,sam,Right here.
36911,c.j.,Shh!
36912,bartlet," Well, first of all, let's clear up a couple of things. ""Unfunded mandate"" is two  words, not one ""big word."" "
36913,bartlet," There are times when we're fifty states and there are times when we're one  country, and have national needs. And the way I know this is that Florida didn't fight  Germany in World War II or establish civil rights. You think states should do the  governing wall-to-wall. That's a perfectly valid opinion. But your state of Florida got  $12.6 billion in federal money last year-- from Nebraskans, and Virginians, and New  Yorkers, and Alaskans, with their Eskimo poetry. 12.6 out of a state budget of $50  billion, and I'm supposed to be using this time for a question, so here it is: Can we  have it back, please?"
36914,josh,Game on.
36915,c.j.,"Oh, my God!"
36916,sam,"Strike 'em out, throw 'em out!  Anybody want spin?"
36917,c.j., It's not going to be Uncle Fluffy.
36918,toby,No.
36919,bartlet,"Actually, what you've done in Florida is bring the right together with the far right.  And I don't think Americans are tired of partisan politics; I think they're tired of  hearing career politicians diss partisan politics to get a gig. I've tried it before,  they ain't buying it. That's okay, though. That's okay, though, 'cause partisan  politics is good. Partisan politics is what the founders had in mind. It guarantees  that the minority opinion is heard, and as a lifelong possessor of minority opinions,  I appreciate it. But if you're troubled by it, Governor, you should know, in this  campaign, you've used the word ""liberal"" seventy-four times in one day. It was yesterday."
36920,toby," I'm not sure I can watch anymore. No, wait, I can. I can."
36921,leo,"The air strike was neither unwarranted nor was it against the people of Qumar. It was  against two Bahji terrorist camps after the Isreali Foreign Minster was shot down by  Bahji operatives of, by-the-by, Qumair citizenship. Educated, if we're going to use  that word, in Qumari madrassahs and financed by fat members of the Qumari Royal Family,  including the Sultan's brother, Abdul ibn Shareef."
36922,leo,"Yes, and you have the results of joint U.S, U.K., and Qumari search and rescue  operations, that detail the tragic loss at sea. Yet your intelligence services seem  ready to tell the world that it was Israel."
36923,leo,Of terrorists. Are you saying Mr. Shareef was one of them?
36924,leo,"Jordan, I..."
36925,leo,"I can't play games with these people anymore. I can't do it anymore. Ben Yosef gave me  the medal of David, and ten hours later he was dead. I can't pretend Qumar's our quirky  little ally whose culture it's important to be tolerant of. They're not wearing wooden  shoes. I was a soldier. I flew fighters over the DMZ. It was incredibly dangerous. What  did I do that for? What am I handing to the next guy and to my kid?"
36926,bartlet," No, the question is: Should we focus on 90% of the kids, who go to public school,  or give parents money from the public-school budget to send their kids to private school  at a time when private schools are even turning kids away who can afford it? Public  schools are going to be the best schools in the country. They're gonna be cathedrals.  The answer is a change in the way we finance schools!"
36927,leo,"You think the President's afraid that if he admitted complicity in Shareef's death,  he would lose votes in this country? To sweep all fifty states, the President would  only need to do two things-- blow the Sultan's brains out in Times Square, then walk  across the street to Nathan's and buy a hot dog. Mr. Ambassador, you are going to turn  the Mastico around. You are going to cease and desist any disinformation campaign that  links the death of Shareef to Israel. And sometime next year, the Sultan is going to  propose a Middle East peace plan -- the Qumar plan -- and win the Nobel Peace Prize.  Make your phone call. I'll be waiting."
36928,bartlet,There it is.
36929,c.j.,He's got it.
36930,bartlet," That's the ten-word answer my staff's been looking for for two weeks. There it  is. Ten-word answers can kill you in political campaigns. They're the tip of the sword.  Here's my question: What are the next ten words of your answer? Your taxes are too high?  So are mine. Give me the next ten words. How are we going to do it? Give me ten after  that, I'll drop out of the race right now. Every once in a while... every once in a  while, there's a day with an absolute right and an absolute wrong, but those days almost  always include body counts. Other than that, there aren't very many unnuanced moments  in leading a country that's way too big for ten words. I'm the President of the United  States, not the President of the people who agree with me. And by the way, if the left  has a problem with that, they should vote for somebody else."
36931,c.j.," I'm going to make a bold suggestion, but  hear me out. Let's not spin. Let's leave the room. We'll use the experts, but nobody  from the campaign, nobody from the White House, and definitely not us."
36932,josh,Why?
36933,c.j.,"There's nothing left to do here, and it's inelegant. It's the punch Ali never gave  Foreman when he was going down."
36934,toby,Absolutely.
36935,josh,"All right, just a statement. The President's on his way to Washington to get back to  work."
36936,sam,And there'll be a lot of drinking on the plane. I don't think that should be included  in the statement.
36937,c.j.,No. Good heads-up.
36938,c.j.,Mr. Secretary?
36939,c.j.,I have a question. Isn't there a decent chance you and the President are wrong?
36940,c.j.,"I mean, doesn't he also know that Chinese political dissidents are going to be sewing  soccer balls together with their teeth whether or we sell them cheeseburgers or not?  I mention this because the President just reminded us that complexity isn't a vice. "
36941,c.j.,"You're the one I like, too. "
36942,bartlet,You'll be back.
36943,sam,Hey.
36945,sam,Thank you.
36947,sam,Winning?
36949,sam,Good.
36951,sam,"So did we. But then, we were convinced by polling that said he was going to be seen  as arrogant no matter what performance he gave in the debate. And then, that morning  at 3:10, my phone rings, and it's Toby Ziegler. He says, ""Don't you get it? It's a gift  that they're irreversibly convinced that he's arrogant 'cause now he can be."" If your  guy's seen that way, you might as well knock some bodies down with it."
36953,sam,"Not this time. I had to return the rental car; that's why I was glad to get together  again. One-way charges on rental cars are insane. I think if everybody drove one way,  it'd all work out in the wash. What do you think?"
36955,sam,"Let the campaign fold, man. Stay out of the news his week."
36957,sam,Thank you.
36958,sam,You grew up in California politics?
36960,sam,Why?
36962,sam,"You're not Thomas Bailey's grandson by any chance, are you?"
36964,sam,"Hmm. That had to have been a nice Career Day. ""Hello, I'm Will's dad. I'm Supreme  Commander, NATO Allied Forces."" Not a lot of kids took your lunch money, right?"
36966,sam,"It's embarrassing, Will."
36968,sam,All of them.
36970,sam,You're the one who wrote Tillman's speech.
36972,sam,"His speech to the Standford Club-- yes, you are."
36974,sam,"That's fine. But you and I both know different, right? So let's have some respect for  that."
36976,sam,No.
36978,sam,Speechwriters don't do that.
36980,sam,"Okay, I'll just say that it was very good, and a number of people think so, and leave  it there. Except to say that the jokes worked, too. I don't know who wrote them, maybe  the King of Belgium, but I know it wasn't the Governor of California. "
36982,sam,That's the one I thought was your assistant.
36984,sam,What a great name.
36986,sam,Why'd you tell me that?
36988,sam,Where'd you find her?
36990,sam,"All right. Thank you for the beer and for the lively conversation. Listen.. if you  can't find a Democrat, tells Mrs. Wilde... tell Kay that I'll do it."
36992,sam,"Tell her I'm a magna cum laude graduate of Princeton and editor of the Duke Law Review.  Tell her I've worked for Congressmen and the DCCC. I have seven years at Gage Whitney,  and for the last four I've served as Deputy Communications Director and Senior Counsel.  Tell her I grew up two streets from here."
36994,sam,"This is for election night, if you win. If I read about it before that, I'm gonna deny  it and we're through. "
36995,sam,Excuse me. 
36996,sam,Listen.
36997,sam,"Thank you. Listen, I've got to get to a bed, but I just wanted to say, thanks for the  hard work. One more week. You're making a lot of people proud. And if you get a chance,  read the text of the Governor's speech to the Stanford Club. It's going to give you  chills. And the jokes, I think, are particularly funny. Anyway... good luck."
36998,sam,"Good night, Will."
37000,sam,Keep it.
37001,josh,Thank you.
37002,josh,Yeah.
37003,josh,Sure.
37004,josh,"No, you can't vote for him in two columns."
37005,josh,You're ballots going to be invalidated.
37006,josh,You're only allowed to vote once.
37007,josh,He's on the ballot more than that. He's on the ballot as the Liberal Party nominee...
37008,josh,"Me, too, and I'm saying yours is a vote we didn't get."
37009,josh,"No. No, uh, you can vote for the President in whatever column you want, but you can only vote once."
37010,josh,"Yes, I'm... Yes."
37011,josh,Yes. No. It doesn't... You can't vote for a party. You have to vote for a person.
37012,josh,I'm not.
37013,josh,"Well, then you voted for none but one candidate."
37014,josh,Did you vote for the President? Was the Presidnet the one box?
37015,josh,It was a minute and a half ago.
37016,josh,I'm sorry. Thank you for voting.
37017,josh, Yes. What? 
37018,josh,"Yes, hello."
37019,josh,I can be who you want.
37020,josh,Thank you.
37021,josh,Just part of the job ma'am.
37022,josh,"Well, I'm just worried 'cause they all tried to vote for Bartlet, and if this keeps up, we're  headed towards biggest electoral upset in history and nobody's going to be able to figure out why."
37023,josh,Right. No!
37024,josh,No. Listen to me. Your ballot is invalid.  So is yours. Punch the box  next to the candidate you prefer once-- nothing else.
37025,josh,Yes.
37026,josh,What?
37027,josh,You know Toby?
37028,josh,"I see. You guys are a little troupe. A little acting troupe with a ""U""."
37029,josh,No.
37030,josh,"As a matter of fact, that would be nice."
37031,josh,Yes!
37032,sam,No.
37033,sam,No.
37034,sam,The partisanship's over. We elected a President. This is for everybody. No banners tonight;  the American flag.
37035,c.j.,"Okay, but we're using the seal and I'll put Senate and House leadership up there."
37036,sam,"No balloons, no confetti."
37037,c.j.,Why?
37038,sam,It's not a party.
37039,c.j.,It is a party.
37040,sam,"Yeah, but we won. We don't have to pander."
37041,toby,Please don't say that.
37042,c.j.,"On your birthday, don't we pander to you?"
37043,sam,Not as much as I'd like.
37044,toby,I'm not kidding.
37045,c.j.,What are you babbling about?
37046,toby,We haven't won anything yet.
37047,c.j.,The speech is done.
37048,toby,Two speeches are done.
37049,c.j.,What's the second?
37050,toby,"I've got a speech if he wins, I've got a speech if he doesn't."
37051,sam,You wrote a concession?
37052,toby,Of course I wrote a concession. You want to tempt the wrath of the whatever from high atop the thing?
37053,sam,No.
37054,toby,"Then go outside, turn around three times and spit. What the hell's the matter with you?"
37055,sam,It's like 25 degrees outside.
37056,toby,Go.
37057,josh,Hello.
37058,c.j.," Oh, Mr. Lyman. I see your picture in the magazine. Tell me, if I swallow  my ballot, does it still...?"
37059,josh,A little election day humor-- that's great.
37060,sam,He wrote a concession speech.
37061,josh,Of course he wrote a concession speech. Why wouldn't he? What possible reason would he have  for not writing a concession speech?
37062,sam,The wrath from high atop the thing.
37063,toby,He upped and said we were gonna...
37064,josh,"No, you got to go outside, turn around three times and curse."
37065,toby,Spit.
37066,josh,Spit and curse.
37067,toby,Do everything. Go!
37068,josh,Go!
37069,toby,Go!
37070,josh,Go!
37071,toby,Go!
37072,josh,These things have a half-life. You just can't...
37073,toby,"All right, we're meeting again, when?"
37074,toby,11:00 unless there's a reason earlier.
37075,c.j., Can I have you two seconds?
37076,toby,Yeah. What do you need?
37077,c.j.,Hang on.
37078,toby,There's trouble?
37079,c.j.,A little bit.
37080,toby,For the President?
37081,c.j.,For you.
37082,c.j.,"Listen, I know better then to stick my face in your personal life except, you know, for sport."
37083,toby,What happened?
37084,c.j.,Roll Call's got it from the Office of Congress's Attending Physician that Andy's pregnant.
37085,toby,When did they start doing more than flu vaccinations?
37086,c.j.,They need updated medical records.
37087,toby,"Roll Call doesn't need updated medical records though, do they?"
37088,c.j.,They're going to connect the dots. It's going to be bad for her and bad for you.
37089,toby,You mean bad for us.
37090,c.j.,"I can handle the ""us."" What's her plan?"
37091,toby,I don't know.
37092,c.j.,Toby...
37093,toby,I dont know. We haven't talked about it.
37094,c.j.,She's got to be proactive.
37095,toby,Yeah.
37096,c.j.,It would be nice if we could announce a wedding.
37097,toby,I'm working on that. Thanks.
37098,c.j.,"You'll talk to her, hmm?"
37099,toby,Yeah.
37100,c.j.,Thanks.
37101,c.j.,Did you...?
37102,sam,"Yes, I turned, I cursed, I spat, it froze."
37103,c.j.,Can't be too careful.
37104,sam,I think you can.
37105,sam,"  Sancho, how you doing?"
37106,sam,Yeah.
37108,sam,"Yes, grasshopper."
37110,sam,"What's there to know? You stand 100 yards away and say ""Who'd you vote for?"" You can't  afford exit polls."
37112,sam,And?
37114,sam,What?
37116,sam,What do you mean?
37118,sam,"Okay, can I give you a nickels worth of free advice?"
37120,sam,"It's not advice so much as I'm saying this: Democrats vote early, okay? And diehards vote early."
37122,sam,Every hour.
37124,sam,"Bonnie, Democrats vote early, right?"
37125,sam,"Ginger, Democrats and diehards vote eary, right?"
37126,sam,Okay.
37130,bartlet,Better than if I won my home state but lost my home country. The only poll that matters closes  in 17 hours.
37131,bartlet,"Title 63, Chapter 659, Section 43 of New Hampshire election code says electioneering is prohibited  within a corridor ten feet wide and extending a distance from the entrance door of the building as  determined by the moderator where the election is being held. If anyone knows what that means..."
37132,bartlet,"Yeah, I voted for the bond issue. It's going to improve public education without a tax abatement."
37133,bartlet,"Well, one way or another I imagine we'll be talking tonight. I got to get back. You can hockle  Abbey for awhile. She's taking the next plane."
37134,bartlet,"Yeah. Listen, you think you could score me a couple of aspirin?"
37135,bartlet,I'm fine.
37136,bartlet,"No, it's just a headache. Just me and you today, okay. I'm fine."
37137,bartlet,I'll sign these in the car.
37138,bartlet,Come on. 
37139,bartlet,"Okay, this can wait. Let's go."
37140,josh,"Nothing's happening right bow. By the end of the night, 100 million votes will be cast. Polls  have been open in the East for six and a half hours. You know how many votes have been cast?  One percent. Everybody votes after work. Not me, I vote first thing. The VNS exit polls are  down in Michigan for a little while. And it's raining Oregon. This is like the ionization  blackout period."
37142,josh,Senior staff.
37144,josh,What do you need?
37146,josh,Yeah.
37148,josh,Is this a joke?
37150,josh,"No, I mean this."
37152,josh,Toby already did the thing this morning with the invalid ballots.
37154,josh,This isn't a joke?
37156,josh,You voted for Ritchie.
37158,josh,Here.
37160,josh,"Yeah, your ""picking the winner"" streak is probably over."
37162,josh,"Almost. That's almost what you did. What you did was draw a line through the Republican ticket.  You didn't ticket split, you voted for every Republican in Wisconsin. I would check, you may  have voted for McCarthy."
37164,josh,How?
37166,josh,It will be counted.
37168,josh,I'm going in. You still want me to have him...?
37170,josh,"Hey, I'm going in, okay?"
37171,josh,I'm sorry?
37172,josh,I'm Senior Staff.
37173,josh,How do you know I don't have it?
37174,josh,No. I memorized it.
37175,josh,I got it. I read it. It was good stuff. It's possible the salient details escape me.
37176,josh,That's a fair point and next time I'm going to remember the memo.
37177,josh,You want me to go back to my office and get it?
37178,josh,Okay. All right. I'm going to humor the new girl.
37179,josh,Yes.
37180,josh,How you doing?
37181,josh,"Uh... He, should, uh...  You should play football."
37182,josh,Yeah.
37183,josh,"Rule Number Two- Daily Senior Staff will... something the briefing memo. I have the briefing  memo, I'm going in."
37184,josh,No?
37185,josh,The salients details...
37186,josh,That's insanity.
37187,josh,There has to be a natural fluidity to these things. It's how we work best. You can't say  that every meeting has to...
37188,josh,"Well, I think that's a random cracking of the whip."
37189,josh,"Okay. Well, yes that's hard to argue against and I'll remember this talk the next time."
37190,josh,"Okay, well, I'm going in now, all right?"
37191,josh,All right. This is your little part of the store and I respect that. See what I did there?  Respect. No one's bigger than the game.
37192,josh,Yeah.
37194,josh,Where you going?
37196,josh,I'm sorry?
37198,josh,Really?
37200,josh,And you think it's going to take about 20 minutes?
37202,josh,You bet. Toby...
37203,josh,Okay.
37204,josh,"Ooh, big needle. 18 inches. Right in the stomach, Toby. Don't look directly at it."
37205,josh,Hurts like heartbreak.
37206,josh,"Not me personally. Toby, when you get there, it's a good idea to slip the nurse something.  Tell her you're hoping for a smooth second trimester."
37207,toby,"He's kidding. Give me one second, would you? I'll catch right up."
37208,toby," Yes. So what do you think, like 50 bucks?"
37209,josh,"I don't know. It's your first, it's twins... I don't know. I think I'd give her $100."
37210,toby,"Yeah, okay."
37211,josh,In your life you have never been on time to this meeting.
37212,sam,"Yeah, I wasn't, actually. I was just incredibly late to the meeting right before it."
37213,josh,"Well, that's the trick, then."
37214,sam,Yeah.
37215,josh,That name sounds familiar.
37216,sam,He's a guy in California. He's on the phone and I'm going to talk to him now.
37217,josh,Yeah?
37218,sam,Yeah.
37219,josh,Everything all right?
37220,sam,Yeah.
37221,josh,California 47th. He was the guy running Horton Wilde?
37222,sam,Yeah.
37223,josh,"Yeah, they're going to lose that by 20 points."
37224,sam,Really?
37225,josh,Yeah.
37226,sam,You're getting that from the exit?
37227,josh,Yeah.
37228,sam,Great.
37229,josh,Great?
37230,sam,"No, I mean, it's a tough beat, what with dying and all."
37231,josh,Yeah.
37232,sam,"I'm going to talk to him now, okay?"
37233,josh,Okay.
37234,sam,Hey.
37236,sam,Josh says the exits have you down 20.
37238,sam,He said the exits.
37239,josh,"Hey, when I said ""exits"" before, I meant ""tracking"". And I'm pretty sure they did the last  one about a week ago and then left town."
37240,sam,"Yeah, yeah, they may have called that putt a little early."
37242,sam,"Yeah, but listen, Will, no kidding, drive times also when the plants get out and the real Orange  County votes and that's when you turn into a pumpkin. I'm just saying, don't get your hopes up."
37244,sam,All right. 
37247,toby,Roll Call has the pregnancy.
37248,toby,Roll Call has the pregnancy. C.J. just told me.
37249,toby,A little while ago.
37250,toby,I didn't want to ruin the day for you.
37251,toby,I couldn't help it.
37252,toby,What are you saying that to me for?
37253,toby,"Just out of curiosity, how long did you think this was going to be covert? These are twins, Andy.  You think you're going to go on Meet the Press and Russerts not going to notice you're the size of  a school? Why not just come out and say ""I'm expecting twins. I couldn't be happier. The father's  my ex-husband, Toby Ziegler, to whom I'll be remarried on a date to be decided upon. I'm thinking  Christmas."""
37254,toby,Then say the first part at least.
37255,toby,"These bodies of yours, I don't know how you live with them."
37256,toby,I like the outsides.
37257,toby,She's kidding.
37258,toby,"You should draft a release. In fact, let that be my first act of fatherhood-- drafting your  release. Go back to my roots as we all must go. And now you're on offense and not defense."
37259,toby,"The things we do in our lives, many of them are not voluntary."
37260,toby,"Yes, indeed. So let my second act be throwing you a little press conference."
37261,toby,Do I need to tell you the first rule of damage control?
37262,toby,"Get the information out early, get it out yourself, do it on your own terms."
37263,toby,"Andy, look. I'm not kidding. You've got... "
37264,toby,What was it?
37265,toby,Did you hear that?
37266,toby,Shh.
37267,toby,"Andy, you-you can see their... heads. My kids have heads."
37274,sam,"Hey, you know what? No problem shouting in public, but I think..."
37276,sam,Yeah. Josh told me you were still out here. I was over at the place.
37278,sam,You want to get a muffin?
37279,sam,"Yeah, I'll walk you."
37281,sam,It's raining in Oregon.
37282,josh,"Yeah, yeah, Josh was talking about that before. Apparently all his other problems are solved."
37283,sam,"If you guys are going to win big, you don't want it to rain. There's less motivation anyway  'cause of the blowout and... you have no idea how fast these things can become a race."
37285,sam,I did something last week. I went to see a guy named Will Bailey. He ran Horton Wilde's  campaign in Orange County and Wilde died a couple of weeks ago and his widow wanted to  know what Democrat was going to stand in for her husband should he win and I said...
37287,sam,"You have to understand. This wasn't something that cost me anything. They weren't going to  annouve unless Wilde won and that was never going to happen in Orange County. It's like the  Secretary of Agriculture saying, ""Sure, I'm ready to assume the Presidency should the 18 who  come before me die. Why not?"""
37289,sam,Becase it's a two-point race right now.
37291,sam,No. It's not. The prospect of going back on my word to a recent widow...
37293,sam,"Because the alternative is taking 90 days off to go home, lose by 20 points to a Republican  committee chair I hate and never be able to run for public office for real, which is something  I maybe wouldn't mind doing one day."
37295,sam,That's exactly what I'm thinking.
37297,sam,What?
37299,sam,No.
37301,sam,"Okay. Okay, I'm going to go back to the office."
37303,sam,Why don't you give me the button.
37305,bartlet,Hello. Hi. What's going on?
37306,bartlet,What was wrong with the old way?
37307,bartlet,What was wrong with the old way?
37308,bartlet,How?
37309,bartlet,I hear you've got rules for meetings.
37310,bartlet,"You don't think that's apt to create a resentment among the people who were here before with...?  It's not like the thing wasn't working with... Whatever you may assume, that wasn't a rube  sitting out there, Debbie. She ran the Oval Office for two years and a state house before that."
37311,bartlet,"What if, instead of you, I want a dial tone?"
37312,bartlet,Why?
37313,bartlet,You're going to place a lot of my outgoing calls...
37314,bartlet,I can make my own phone call. Don't be...
37315,bartlet,I can make my own phone calls.
37316,bartlet,That's good. That's a good idea.
37317,bartlet,No.
37318,bartlet,I'm sorry about that. 
37319,bartlet,Debbie... I have to ask you. Are we talking about...? Did you bring it up 'cause you...  noticed...? Is there some particular thing today you noticed?
37320,bartlet,"No, please. I was talking about something else. Line one is you?"
37321,bartlet,Thanks.
37352,josh,"See, now there are late exits showing even with white male suburbans in New York and Chicago  and Philadelphia. There's huge labor turnout. We're only losing Florida by seven-- seven.  Toby, I think this is going to be bigger than we thought."
37353,toby,"I stare at this and I stare at this and I don't know which is the boy and which is the girl.  I suppose that problem will take care of itself. You know, if you stare at them for awhile,  well, it's pretty gross, but still..."
37354,josh,"Okay, I'm concerned that you've turned completely into another person."
37355,toby,Hey. I see one victory ballon before this thing is called and...!
37356,toby,"Yeah, you better run!  Huh?"
37357,josh,Nothing.
37362,josh,It's on. You can see it.
37363,toby,I'm not spitting. I'm not turning around. Union households are beating non-unions in some  of these districts..
37364,c.j.,Yeah.
37365,josh,What was that?
37366,c.j.,You'll see in a minute. 
37367,c.j.,"Good evening, Mr. President."
37368,bartlet,"I feel like I should be self-deprecating. I mean, it's not inauguration. I could be funny,  right? I don't thibk so. I think it's the wrong note. If I'm thanking campaign staff, maybe. "
37369,bartlet,What are you doing?
37370,c.j.,We've got some news.
37371,bartlet,What? 
37372,bartlet,What?
37373,leo,You're going to win New Hampshire.
37374,bartlet,"Halfway aroung the world in Bosnia and Chechnya and Rwanda, they dream of the promise we  fulfilled today of a future we chose, for ourelves, together."
37376,sam,They're not calling it.
37377,bartlet,"Four years ago, we were joined by our highest ideals, by our best hopes, and tonight we're  joined by the same commitment to open new doors of oppurtunity and justice. "
37378,bartlet,"To ensure that the promise of the country is the birthright of all the people. We've achieved  so much together always believing, always knowing that America could be made new again and so  it was, and so it will be again. God bless you all. God bless the United States of America."
37379,josh,We're going to skip the parties for a while and head back to the office. There are nine House  races too close to call. Tell him about California.
37380,toby,In the California 47th...
37381,josh,"In the 47th-- You don't tell it well. In the 47th, Horton Wilde, who's dead, is losing by 88 votes.  It was a perfect storm."
37382,toby,It was.
37383,josh,"Low Republican turnout, 'cause the President won he Midwest. Low supporter turnout 'cause Webb  didn't have an opponent and the DNC gave up on it a week ago so the RNC left town and they never  saw the exits your guy Will Bailey was seeing."
37384,toby,Plus there was an actual storm. I tell it fine.
37385,josh,"Anyway, we're going to be up all night with these. It's going to be fun."
37386,sam,We should go.
37388,bartlet,That was fun.
37390,bartlet,I feel great.
37392,bartlet,"No, I'm fine."
37394,bartlet,Yeah.
37396,bartlet, How'd you know?
37398,bartlet,Just for a minute at the end. I couldn't see it.
37400,bartlet,"Yeah, I know. We can still have tonight, though, right?"
37402,bartlet,All right.
37403,c.j.,Excuse me. You want to take another curtain call?
37405,sam,"He said... what he said was this-- he said, ""A probable impossibility is preferable to an  improbable possibility."" The impossible is preferable to the improbable. What did he mean?  He meant that it's okay to have a broomstick sing and dance, but you shouldn't turn on the  radio and hear the news report you need to hear."
37407,sam,No.
37409,sam,What kind?
37411,sam,They have flavors.
37413,sam,"It was a confluence of events that I'm saying, if you pitched it to a Hollywood movie producer,  they'd tell you that Aristotle says, a probable impossibility is preferable to an improbable  possibility."
37415,sam,"The Midwest, the RNC exits, a dead candidate, a rainstorm...? It's Aristotle all over the place."
37417,sam,You really don't know what kind...?
37419,sam,"I talked to the woman. She had tears in her voice. Her husband loved the President, admired  his integrity. Yes, we're big on integrity. By the way, when I said I'd run in his place,  it's not like I meant it."
37421,sam,You're right.
37422,sam,"Bonnie, Ginger, get me Will Bailey. Get me Kay Wilde very quickly, please."
37423,sam,"Get Will Bailey, please. Got to get him."
37424,sam,Get him. Got to get him.
37425,sam,Of course you can. Why not?
37426,sam,They're talking about someone else.
37427,sam,"Yeah, okay. Anyone know where Toby and Josh and C.J. are? Hey! Toby! Josh! C.J.! Does  anyone...?"
37428,sam,Hi.
37429,c.j.,"Josh, Sam Donaldson from the ABC Nightly News program's on the phone. He'd like to know if  the President is endorsing Sam."
37430,josh,"Toby, is the President endorsing Sam? Hmm? Is the President endorsing Sam?"
37431,toby,"I don't know. He's asleep, but let's go ask him."
37432,sam,All right.
37433,sam,"All right, look, this is extremely easy to explain. First of all... okay... How familiar  are the three of you with Aristotle?"
37434,josh,You agreed to run?
37435,toby,"Sam, what the hell...!"
37436,sam,"I said it for the widow. She wanted a name for election night and I said, ""Use my name,""  not thinking for a second it was ever going to be a practical option. Can I ask, is your  office now The House of Rising Sun?"
37437,c.j.,Yes.
37438,toby,You did it for the widow.
37439,sam,"Yes, and for a guy I met named Will Bailey who was running the campaign and worked his ass off  and never backed off and, by the way, navigated a dead liberal Democrat to a win against Chuck  Webb! Five hundred races tonight, that was pretty impressive. Though it was an Aristotlian  confluence of events that could only happen to me. I have to talk to the widow."
37440,c.j.,I would actually talk to the President first.
37441,sam,Really?
37442,c.j.,"He's going to get it first thing in the morning. There's a seat in play. He's going to be  asked about it and he can't say, you know, ""My God, I have no earthly idea what you're  talking about."""
37443,sam,"Okay. Yeah, all right."
37444,bartlet,"I don't want to intimidate you, but it turns out I'm the first Democrat in twenty years to  make a clean sweep of the Plains states and I'm not just talking about Iowa and Nebraska."
37446,bartlet,Yeah.
37448,bartlet,"I won the Dakotas. The Badlands. The Black Hills. But let's go down, way down, to the Deep  South and the humid bayou of Louisiana and its nine electoral votes. What manner of man it  must take to win the state, which, by the way, is the only one operating under the Napoleonic  Code of France and I still don't know what that's all about, but back to me..."
37450,bartlet,Who's your Commander in Chief?
37452,bartlet,"Yes. And do the ladies like him? Oh, yes. To the tune of 58%. "
37453,bartlet,Yeah? 
37454,bartlet,"I thought we had an understanding with regard to tonight and interruptions, Charlie.  I thought we were men. "
37455,bartlet,Sam needs to see me? 
37456,bartlet,"It's like what, 1:00 in the morning? "
37457,bartlet,"Well, let's send him in."
37458,sam,"Good evening, Mr. President."
37459,bartlet,Good to see you.
37460,sam,I hope I'm not here at a bad time.
37461,bartlet,"No, what would make you say that?"
37462,sam,"Actually, it looks as if I couldn't have picked a worse time."
37463,bartlet,"No, no, you could have and I'm not going to take any chances, so let's do it now."
37464,sam,Horton Wilde won in the 47th.
37465,bartlet,I know.
37466,sam,There's going to be a special election.
37467,bartlet,Yeah.
37468,sam,"And uh, to make a long story short, you might be asked first thing tomorrow if you're  endorsing me."
37469,bartlet,Am I.
37470,sam,"Well, I'm not really running."
37471,bartlet,"Then, I'm behind you 100%."
37472,sam,Look...
37473,bartlet,"Man, is everything all right?"
37474,sam,"Yeah, I made a promise to the widow in a moment of..."
37476,sam,"Hey, Mrs. Bartlet."
37478,bartlet,"Yeah, look, honey, Sam stopped by."
37480,sam,Hi.
37481,bartlet,"Eyes front, mister."
37482,sam,"You know, sir, I'll have this taken care of in the next few hours anyway. You don't even  need to worry about it."
37483,bartlet,You sure you're okay?
37484,sam,"Yes, sir."
37485,bartlet,Okay.
37486,sam,This Dean Martin?
37487,bartlet,Yeah.
37488,sam,Good.
37489,bartlet,Thank you.
37490,sam,"Thank you, Mr. President."
37491,sam,"Could you keep trying Will Bailey, please? "
37492,toby,"Hey, you too, Tom. "
37493,toby,Yeah. Any idea where Mama is? 
37494,toby,"Andy! Andy, don't drink that..."
37495,toby,"Yeah, okay, ginger ale can be bad according to the latest studies. It can be very..."
37496,toby,That was very pleasant. Can I talk to you for a second?
37497,toby,You won by 85% of the vote.
37498,toby,"Yeah, well, as long as you scraped by with a win. Look, a-a statement."
37499,toby,Roll Call has it. that's why we have to deal with it.
37500,toby,"Congresswoman Wyatt, are you pregnant?"
37501,toby,You can't withhold that from your constituents.
37502,toby,"Yeah, did you hear the rumour that there was a Congressional investigation and it almost  detonated his Presidency?"
37503,toby,I'm not worried about you.
37504,toby,"Yeah, you know what? Single moms are a lot more sympathetic than deadbeat dads, so I  wouldn't gallivant."
37505,toby,"I know that, and you know that, but if I can't protect my kids, their mom, and the President  all at the same time, then I've got to quit my job, so can you help me out?"
37506,toby,You'll make a statement?
37507,toby,I'm the father!
37508,toby,Eighty-five percent of what kind of backward population votes for this woman?
37509,leo,"Woman. Yes, indeed, ma'am. 58%. But, let's take a trip down Louisiana way, huh? Where we  find it's nine electoral votes go to..."
37510,leo,Yeah?
37511,leo,Got it. Good tip. Keep 'em coming.
37512,leo,Yes ma'am.
37513,leo,How you doing?
37514,leo,Yeah.
37515,leo,What about GV?
37516,leo,Are you ready to brief?
37517,leo,Yeah.
37518,leo,Can you hang around for a minute? There's about to be a coup in Venezeula.
37519,leo,Thanks.
37520,c.j.,"Shh. Hey, hey, hey, with the singing of the song!"
37521,c.j.,Does anyone know who this is?
37522,josh,I don't... I think he won the election.
37523,c.j.,It sounds like he did very well.
37524,josh,It is. He's a pollster.
37525,c.j.,Excuse me. Don't break things.
37526,c.j.,Bruno.
37527,c.j.,Excuse me.
37528,c.j.,You got a second?
37529,c.j.,You know a guy named Chris Whitaker?
37530,c.j.,Whitaker.
37531,c.j.,Are you drunk?
37532,c.j.,Chris Whitaker.
37533,c.j.,He was just on TV claiming credit for your energy strategy.
37534,c.j.,He's claming credit for the energy strategy and who knows what else.
37535,c.j.,Bruno.
37536,c.j.,I think you should talk to some reporters. You are entitled to the status you've earned.
37537,c.j.,I'm going to be watching this guy.
37538,c.j.,"We owe you, Bruno."
37539,c.j.,I'm going to be watching this guy.
37540,c.j.,Okay.
37541,c.j.,Donna.
37543,c.j.,You might want to tell Josh that a few carlaods of women...
37545,c.j.,Okay.
37546,josh,Hang on. A couple people from the Womens Leadersip Coalition just... 
37547,josh,"Yes, hello."
37548,josh,Sure.
37549,josh,Thanks.
37550,josh,How you doing on the night?
37551,josh,"So the guys at Lexington and Concord, they didn't die in vain."
37552,josh,"Want to hear the funniest thing? A week ago, Sam told Horton Wilde's widow that he'd run  in his place."
37553,josh,You heard?
37554,josh,"All these events conspired to... like the DNC gave up on the race so the RNC left town,  leaving no one to read the exits..."
37555,josh,I can do it. The President won the Midwest and there was depressed Republican turnout in  the district 'casue it was never a race...
37556,josh,I keep hearing that name.
37557,josh,"For a dead candidate, of course you did. Anyway, Sam's desperately trying to get ahold  of the widow so he can have the worst conversation of his life. He's... just going to  have to say..."
37558,josh,What do you mean?
37559,josh,He'll get killed.
37560,josh,"Angry House Democrats. I'm shivering, hold my hand."
37561,josh,"You know what, the President's coattails were long enough to elect a Democrat out of Orange  County with literally no pulse. Any Congressman complaining..."
37562,josh,Who has to...
37563,josh,You're ahead 90 bucks?
37564,josh,"All right, give me your coat."
37565,josh,What?
37566,josh,"Okay, your coat will be here."
37567,josh,Enjoy.
37568,josh,Donna!
37570,josh,I felt you lurking. I want to try to find a guy named Will Bailey with the Wilde campaign  in Newpport Beach.
37584,josh,I want to talk to you for a minute about Sam. 
37586,josh,"I-I understand completely, Will. "
37588,josh,Let me just ask you this: What are the President's unfavorables in the 47th? 
37590,josh,I'm trying to get a sense of what happens when Sam gets tagged with Bartlet fatigue. 
37592,josh,Sure. 
37594,josh,"I just assumed 'cause most operatives can recite that kind of thing, you know, at the  upper levels. "
37596,josh,"""Strong Leader""? "
37598,josh,Thank you.
37599,josh,Can you find Leo for me?
37629,leo,A request to speack to Ignacio?
37630,leo,And?
37631,leo,"Yeah, that wasn't really a high percentage phone call, was it?"
37632,leo,"Welcome, Commander. When did you start?"
37633,leo,"All right, let me say first this is not a drill."
37634,leo,"Leo. Major Carson from SOUTHCOM; Adam Hallridge, CIA Venezuela Desk; Troop, Assistant  Secretary for Latin American Affairs; and some other people. Ignacio's two top generals--  Martinez and Rojas-- threw their support behind Luna, and Martinez placed Ignacio and his  Vice-President under arrest."
37635,leo,There's 63 Americans in the refinery.
37636,leo,"20 minutes, son."
37637,toby,"""My ex-husband, Toby Ziegler, and I are expecting twins in May. We thank you for your good  wishes and ask for privacy while we consider... reconciliation."" Two sentences."
37638,toby,Yeah.
37639,toby,Harmless.
37640,toby,Thank you.
37641,toby,"Oh, what is the problem?"
37642,toby,I didn't raise my voice.
37643,toby,Was it?
37644,toby,"Fourteenth Amendment protects you from state action, and not the media, who, by the way,  have their own Amendment."
37645,toby,"First of all, three of those guys are outstanding Congressmen. Second of all their  constituents knew they were eighty when they voted for them."
37646,toby,The people who elected you aren't the ones who are going to throw the picnic.
37647,toby,Then what's the problem?
37648,toby,You're not trying to avoid a fight.
37649,toby,You're looking for one.
37650,toby,You're sniffing around for a fight.
37651,toby,Not sniffing around for one as much as... trying to create one. Trying to create trouble  where none existed.
37652,toby,"Well, I can admire that."
37653,toby,No.
37654,toby,I came up with a plan to tell them apart in the initial months.
37655,toby,"Oh, Okay. I was going to hang little signs around their necks."
37656,toby,I don't know.
37657,c.j.,Bruno?
37658,c.j.,She seems nice.
37659,c.j.,Wouldn't you just give anything if she was from Tibet?
37660,c.j.,Whitkenstein.
37661,c.j.,It's going to be the start of a press tour.
37662,c.j.,I'm going to leak some internal campaign memos.
37663,c.j.,I don't care. We can...
37664,c.j.,I know how to do this. I can end a process story and correct the record at the same time.
37665,c.j.,What?
37666,c.j.,"In a poll taken three days after the MS announcement, the President lost to Ritchie by  nine points. He won by 11. You did it."
37667,c.j.,"Okay. Hey... if you want to come back to my office, there's an actual still."
37668,c.j.,Okay.
37669,josh,"Listen, can I talk to you for a minute?"
37670,c.j.,Yeah.
37671,josh,"I've been talking to a few people, and... I-I don't know, I think maybe Sam should run."
37672,c.j.,"I've been thinking about that, too."
37673,josh,When the dust settles what's the story going to be?
37674,c.j.,That we didn't take back the House.
37675,josh,"Yeah, like that was our fault. These people make me crazy. ""He-he didn't do enough down-ticket  campaigning."" You have any idea how much gumbo that man ate?"
37676,c.j.,I don't think running for Congress is the thing you do to change the story.
37677,josh,"I know, but there are real reasons. We give Democrats in the 47th something to get excited  about."
37678,c.j.,You think he should run?
37679,josh,What are you doing here?
37680,josh,Okay.
37681,toby,Hello.
37682,c.j.,Hey.
37683,toby,I bet against a Puerto Rican for Bronx Borough President. I deserve to lose.
37684,josh,Does the U.S. Attorney's Office know about you?
37685,josh,Can we talk to you for a minute?
37686,toby,"Actually, I'm going to, uh, talk to the President and First Lady. Can it wait?"
37687,c.j.,You going to tell them?
37688,toby,Yeah.
37689,c.j.,Can we come?
37690,toby,"No. They're still up, right?"
37691,c.j.,Yeah. 
37692,josh,I think he should do it.
37706,bartlet,"As you can see, we've moved on to the caviar course."
37708,bartlet,"I know how you do. Stoli Cristall, the most elegant of vodkas."
37709,bartlet,The caviar itself is a product of my advice at the Convention on International Trade in  Endangered Species. We passed a much more stringent bill against the poaching of Caspian  Sea sturgeons.
37711,bartlet,California white sturgeon from the Stillman Sea Farm in Elverta. Only the best.
37713,bartlet,"Oh, I think you're going to find..."
37714,bartlet,Excuse me.
37715,bartlet,How you doing?
37716,bartlet,Okay. Anyone else? 
37717,bartlet,"Yeah. You're young, Charlie. Don't you want to be having fun right now? "
37718,bartlet,I get that a lot. Leo.
37719,leo,"Good evening, sir."
37720,bartlet,Yes?
37721,leo,You look sharp.
37722,bartlet,Thank you.
37723,leo,"Hey, Abbey?"
37725,bartlet,What happened?
37726,leo,It sounds like Commando Especial units under Luna broke into the refinery and took control.
37727,bartlet,The Americans?
37728,leo,They're safe. It's over.
37729,bartlet,"Yeah. Well, we kind of knew it was going to be like this."
37730,leo,"Yes, sir."
37731,bartlet,Jordan still here?
37732,leo,Yeah.
37733,bartlet,"All right, have a good night."
37734,leo,"You know Toby's lurking out here, right?"
37735,bartlet,Yeah. Toby!
37736,leo,"Thank you, Mr. President. "
37737,toby,"Good evening, sir."
37738,bartlet,Hi.
37739,toby,"Good evening, Mrs. Bartlet. That's a lovely housecoat you're wearing."
37741,bartlet,"Listen, I'm kind of in the middle of something. Is this anything that could possibly wait  until tomorrow?"
37742,toby,"Of course it is, Mr. President. I'm sorry. Really, I stopped by 'cause I hadn't told you  that Andy's pregnant. It's twins, and of course, I'm the father."
37743,bartlet,"Well, that's great. Well done. See you tomorrow."
37744,toby,Yeah.
37746,bartlet,(to Toby) I was this close.
37748,toby,"Yeah, it's, uh, twins. A boy and a, um, uh, a girl."
37750,bartlet,"You should marry that girl, Toby."
37751,toby,"I'm doing my best, sir."
37753,toby,End of May. I have a picture.
37754,bartlet,Wait a second. End of may? 
37756,bartlet,"Hang on, I'm doing math in my head. Yeah, end of May? Why didn't you tell us until now?"
37758,bartlet,"Yeah, but he's got one."
37759,toby,"The truth is, I don't, sir. At least not a good one. I was intimidated by your Catholicism."
37760,bartlet,Really?
37761,toby,Yeah.
37762,bartlet,"It's my Catholicism, Toby. It works for me."
37764,bartlet,And her. Did you break any laws?
37765,toby,"No, sir."
37766,bartlet,"Then a blessing on your house, young man. Mazel tov."
37767,toby,"Thank you, sir. Thank you, ma'am."
37768,bartlet,Okay.
37769,toby,Is that caviar there?
37771,bartlet,Let's go.
37772,c.j.,"Excuse me. Chris Whitaker, right?"
37773,c.j.,"Thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you."
37774,c.j.,"No, please. We're all impressed with how influential you were, particularly when you consider  that most of us have never met you. But what I'm most grateful for is the process story,  which takes attention from the debate, and focuses it where it belongs, which is the contest.  This is the story everyone'll be clamouring for and I like that you're filling that need.  And to show my gratitude, I'm calling all the major news outlets and letting them know that  I'll be forwarding all your confidential memos to the President, logs of all your calls with  him, Secret Service logs of your meetings inside the White House."
37775,c.j.,Don't disrespect Leo McGarry and Bruno Gianelli.
37776,c.j.,Sam.
37777,sam,I was just on my way. What do you guys think?
37778,c.j.,We need to talk to you.
37779,sam,Talk to me about what?
37780,c.j.,We think you should run.
37781,sam,Why? Why would you think something like that?
37782,c.j.,"Well, it was Josh's idea."
37783,josh,"Actually, it was Amy's."
37784,sam,Why?
37785,sam,"Well, can I just give you the money and not..."
37786,josh,I think you'd energize the state party. We're not going to let you look like a fool.  We won't allow it.
37787,sam,(to Toby) What do you think?
37788,toby,"I don't think you should do it. Energizing the state party's good. A well-funded airing of  the issues is good. So is mollifying House Democrats, but you have to ask yourself, is it  worth it? You're going to lose. A Democrat's always loses in the 47th. Can't just pick up  and try someplace else. They have a name for that."
37789,sam,"I don't know. I don't know. I worked in a State Asembly race in Manhattan in a district  where Democrats outnumbered Republicans 16 to 1. But everywhere we went, there'd be one  lone poster of a right-wing nutbar who wanted to to eliminate the income tax. And he was  holding up signs and canvassing everywhere and bugging the local reporters until we had to  comment on it. So I introduced myself to his campaign manager, and I said, ""What are you  doing? Your candidate doesn't have a chance and neither do your issues."" He said, ""This is  what I believe. And no candidate gets to run in my district without speaking to my issue.""  I came this close to voting for him. So... I don't know about what you just said."
37790,toby,Then I think you should win.
37791,sam,All right.
37792,c.j.,"""All right,"" what?"
37793,sam,"All right. And get me Will Bailey on the phone, too. You think he's still up?"
37794,c.j.,No problem.
37795,josh,"Oh, yeah."
37796,sam,I'm going to take this call.
37797,josh,We'll go with you.
37798,leo,"Boy, you're in the Air Force, the private sector, the Labour Department, two Presidential  campaigns, and rehab, and you think you've seen it all but it turns out you haven't.  'Cause Sam Seaborn is going to be the Democratic candidate for Congress in Orange County."
37799,leo,Why?
37800,leo,"Well, let me tell you something about process, Dr. Kendall, and I'll do so while tuning  this radio to WNKW, ""The Music Of Your Life..."" and begging the sun for one more moment  of moonlight."
37801,leo,"Speaking of the moon. Luna took power tonight. About three dozen people are dead, and  Ignacio's under arrest. He'll be dead soon."
37802,leo,The process matters more than the outcome and that's what we wanted. And therein endeth  the lesson. Will you dance with me?
37803,c.j.,"Mr. President, how do you interpret the margin of victory?"
37804,bartlet,"Well, the votes have been counted and the people have spoken, and it's clear that  their will is for me to be able to do and have anything I want."
37805,c.j.,"Mr. President, Arnold White, Associated Press: What's the first legislative priority  for your second term?"
37806,bartlet,There's a new guy from AP?
37807,c.j.,"Yeah, what's your legislative priority?"
37808,bartlet,"Well the President of Turkmenistan just officially extended the date of adolescence  to twenty-five. So, things like that."
37809,leo,I think he also renamed the month of January after himself.
37810,bartlet,That's just greedy. Real power is knowing when to leave a little something on  the table.
37811,c.j.,"Sir, what legislative..."
37812,c.j.,"Okay, sir. I asked you for a legislative priority, you gave me nine."
37813,bartlet,"It's a big country, Arnold. Debbie! Where the hell, first of all, are you and where  are my..."
37814,bartlet,"Ipswich clams don't come from Chesapeake Bay, they come from Ipswich!"
37815,bartlet,Have her beheaded for my birthday!
37816,toby,"Good morning, sir."
37817,bartlet,Good morning.
37818,toby,They'll ask you how you feel about housing starts going down.
37819,bartlet,I don't care.
37820,c.j.,Sir...
37821,bartlet,As long as I'm keeping this one.
37822,c.j.,GDP growth is strong.
37823,bartlet,"You bet your ass it is. Which, by the way, I can pat anytime I want now. The voters  have spoken. Lowest inflation in twenty years. Housing starts are cyclical, which is  the thing.  What do you got?"
37824,leo,There's going to be a lot of flooding in Missouri.
37825,bartlet,FEMA's on the ground?
37826,leo,Yeah.
37827,bartlet,All right.
37828,leo,"I've got the Swiss Ambassador in my office, I don't know why. "
37829,leo,"Sir, you and I enjoy your funny jokes, but Idaho, you know, not so much. You'll take  it easy in there?"
37830,bartlet,I know my people.
37831,leo,"Yeah, sometimes it's hard to believe I'm one of 'em. Good luck."
37832,bartlet,Thank you.
37833,leo,Okay.
37834,leo,What's going on?
37835,leo,The President appreciates it.
37836,leo,They asked Japan?
37837,leo,What's wrong with Japan's?
37838,leo,It hasn't been successful?
37839,leo,Not once?
37840,leo,"Okay, then ours is better. Anybody else do this?"
37841,leo,"No, Japan doesn't do it yet. Coming close doesn't matter on this. It's not the Gemini  missions. I'm gonna talk to the President, Chris, but if it means bumping an American  off the donor lists..."
37842,leo,A donor or a dissenter?
37843,leo,It wasn't directly from the Ayatollah?
37844,leo,"This is coming through you, through an NGO, through the brother-in-law? Guy's gonna  put his son's life in the hands of the infidels but he'll keep his distance, huh?"
37845,leo,"No, much better that we should have a problem with ours. I'll talk to him."
37846,bartlet," Don't get me wrong, Mark. I think January's a good month..."
37847,leo,"Yeah, the President, Generalissimo... whatever he comes back as."
37848,josh,Messages.
37850,josh,What else?
37852,josh,"Yeah, I'm pretty sure I ate a Springer Spaniel. Why is AP on my phone sheet?"
37853,toby,'Cause Triplehorn told him you are the reason there won't be a deal in prescription  drugs.
37854,josh,I'm the reason?
37855,toby," ""...with Lyman negotiating..."" Yeah."
37856,josh,I'm starting to feel ill-will toward the minority leader.
37857,toby,And I've had it up to here with the Welsh.
37858,josh,"I'm not kidding. He was campaining with us, like, a half hour ago."
37859,toby,School's back. Go see him.
37860,josh,"Let's call tht plan ""A"". Plan ""B"" is you go see him."
37861,toby,Karen Kroft.
37862,josh,And National Parks screws me up again.
37863,toby,Yeah.
37864,josh, I'm going to head up to the Leaders Office. See if you can get me the  first three minutes he has.
37866,josh,"Let's do this: find out what her problem is, solve it and then, I don't know, do  something else."
37868,josh,"Yeah? You're the reason...  Nothing, nothing's happening, nothing's there."
37869,toby,You seem fine.
37870,toby,You really seem fine.
37871,toby,Good.
37872,toby,"Yeah, I've had extensive education. What was the final... margin?"
37873,toby,A hundred and twenty-seven.
37874,toby,Wasn't your last election also...?
37875,toby,"The President says all you need is one, the rest are for ego."
37876,toby,About three and a half million. 
37877,toby,"He's got a pretty healthy ego, though."
37878,toby,I like hotels. I like a good concierge.
37879,toby,Not a big one.
37880,toby,The President thinks there's a place for you.
37881,toby,Huh. We were thinking the same thing.
37882,toby,Yeah.
37883,toby,The Director of the National Parks Service.
37884,toby,No.
37885,toby,No.
37886,toby,Do you want it?
37887,toby,Then get yourself a big hat and Leo's gonna call you in couple of hours.
37888,c.j.,Okay.
37889,toby,All's well that ends well.
37890,c.j.,Karen Kroft?
37891,toby,Yes.
37892,c.j.,National Parks Chairman?
37893,toby,Yes.
37894,c.j.,Nice.
37895,toby,She was very happy.
37896,c.j.,I think Andy's about to get sued for election fraud.
37897,toby,Andy was trying to get sued for election fraud.
37898,c.j.,Really?
37899,toby,"Yeah, she's a pistol."
37900,c.j.,"Before I forget, Susan, Karnow and Duffy, are the first three for tea with the  President at 3:00 P.M. in the Map Room. Susan, Karnow and Duffy. Next week it's  Mark, Leslie and Eric."
37901,c.j.,Sam's putting his team together and I'm going to start referring those questions to  the campaigns press office. Let's start with John then Katie.
37902,sam,"There is no nomination. There's a primary, and if someone gets 50% of the vote,  there's no general."
37903,sam,Yes.
37904,sam,"I supposed you'd have to, yes."
37905,sam,I'm going to let Will Bailey answer those questions.
37907,sam,Excuse me for a second.  Can I talk to you?
37909,sam,"Over here, please."
37911,sam,Hi.
37913,sam,Scott's campaign manager?
37915,sam,What's your title?
37917,sam,I'm not kidding.
37919,sam,Will...
37921,sam,What the hell is going on?
37923,sam,What are you talking about?
37926,sam,Will...
37928,sam,"Well, I'll get rid of some of them."
37931,sam,"We match up fine, and that you got him into this."
37934,sam,What are you gonna do?
37936,sam,Where?
37938,sam,"All right. All right, I got to head back to Washington. I'll see you day after tomorrow."
37940,sam,Thank you.
37941,sam,Thank you. 
37944,bartlet,"Yeah? It's called penmanship, Watson. Something your generation wouldn't know about  because of the computers. How many of these things am I doing?"
37945,bartlet,How many have I done?
37946,bartlet,Three?
37947,bartlet,Your system's slowing me down.
37948,bartlet,You're kidding.
37949,leo,You ready?
37950,bartlet,"Hey, can't we have color coding and stickers priority list? Can I get a little  bureaucracy going here?"
37951,leo,What are you doing?
37952,bartlet,"I'm doing basically what the President does. Ask people for things, then thank them  for things. Let's go.  Take the calls to the mansion. I'll meet you there  after this."
37953,bartlet,We had a couple of cats when the kids were kids named Mr. Finch and Ms. Wilburforce or  something-- I can't remember-- but...
37954,leo,"You know, I've never really liked human names for animals."
37955,bartlet,Really?
37956,leo,Yeah.
37957,bartlet,"Okay, well, I can't believe my kids didn't think to ask you what to name the cats.  But they used to bring mice into the house and show 'em to me."
37958,leo,Yeah?
37959,bartlet,This is how I'm starting to feel about the Swiss.
37960,leo,Yeah.
37961,bartlet,Good morning.
37962,bartlet,Tell me about the boy.
37963,bartlet,11:45?
37964,bartlet,That's eleven minutes from now.
37965,bartlet,"This meeting's a little premature, isn't it? We should wait ten minutes."
37966,bartlet,"This meeting doesn't go in the Sit Room anymore, okay? I don't know why the hell it's  here. This isn't a military operation."
37967,leo,It's a secure room.
37968,bartlet,"My office is a secure room, too, isn't it? Please, somebody tell me it is, or I gotta  go pack some stuff. You see my point?"
37969,leo,What about the organs?
37970,bartlet,"I'm sorry, that sounded funny to me. I'm the kid in bio who laughed all the time."
37971,bartlet,Coach?
37972,leo,Then New York?
37973,leo,So the heart and lungs get here first.
37974,leo,Go around the room.
37975,leo,But it sends a message to the reformists.
37976,bartlet,How old is he?
37977,bartlet,How old is he?
37978,bartlet,"Fifteen. The Shiites, Manny, that's what you want me to take back to my thoracic-surgeon  wife? Get this boy in preop. Somebody tell the Swiss to stop standing in the damn  doorway with a mouse in their mouth. If they're coming in, come in."
37979,bartlet,"No, 'cause we're all in a secure room except for the Ayatollah's staff, a Swissair  pilot, and four hundred other people."
37980,leo,"Manny, is this gonna leak?"
37981,leo,"Well, I feel better already."
37982,bartlet,"Mr. Finch and Mrs. Wilberforce. There's nothing wrong with my memory. Though those  are stupid names, and there's something wrong with my kids."
37983,josh,"You know, the Senate's out of session. You ought to think about putting a Ping-Pong  table out here."
37984,josh,A couple of quick rounds between cloture motions.
37985,josh,I'm kidding Senator.
37986,josh,Just from reading the AP wire.
37987,josh,"Yeah, you're running for President."
37988,josh,I'm not saying any different.
37989,josh,They're locked...? You're recruiting precint captains 48 months before the next election?
37990,josh,If you're saying there's a full-blown nomination fight...
37991,josh,Nothing's being dragged anywhere. You were with us just days ago.
37992,josh,"Yeah, how about we enjoy the present for a few hours?"
37993,josh,"Look, Hoynes is... Did I just fall asleep for three and half years?"
37994,josh,I know you can.
37995,josh,"Okay, I'm not for anyone. I barely unpacked from the last campaign."
37996,josh,"It keeps getting earlier, doesn't it?"
37997,leo,The CEA?
37998,leo,What did we say?
37999,leo,You just did it again!
38000,leo,The robust economy meeting.
38001,toby,Josh is patching it up with Triplehorn. And Karen Kroft wants National Parks.
38002,leo,She can't have it.
38003,toby,What are you talking about?
38004,leo,She can't.
38005,toby,We talked about it in the appointments meeting.
38006,leo,The President signed the parks bill. The job just became Senate-confirmable.
38007,toby,"Yeah, that was for next fiscal year."
38008,leo,Turns out it's retroactive. I just saw the final language.
38009,toby,Who's idea? How did we miss this?
38010,leo,There are 90 amendments in the bill.
38011,toby,Maybe we put her up anyway.
38012,leo,No.
38013,toby,We asked her to do it.
38014,leo,She led the charge for a higher gas tax.
38015,toby,We asked her to do it.
38016,leo,"I understand, but the U.S. Senate isn't going to, plus the minority leader is already  pissed at us. "
38017,toby,Okay. Thanks.
38018,toby,Ginger! 
38019,toby,Don't. Would you... I need a list of sub-cabinets vacancies that aren't Senate- confirmable.
38020,toby,A little less sub-cabinet that that.
38021,bartlet,"No kidding, you want to crash a space probe into Neptune. That's fine with me. I think  we've crashed into most of the planets but $2.5 billion, okay? "
38022,bartlet,"If we're going to fail, I want to do it on budget. "
38023,bartlet,You know what? Why don't you tell Debbie we're going to do some calls?
38024,bartlet,"Yes, calls. Calls. Mr. Sarcasm, with your dry... ""Calls."" I was this close to renaming  one of the oceans after you but no way. Maybe... maybe, one of the species of fish,  like trout.  ""Trout"" is now 'charlie.' Went up to the lake, pulled out a  couple of nice charlie for dinner."
38025,bartlet,Look at the size of that charlie you've got mounted on your wall!
38026,bartlet,What have you got?
38027,c.j.,"Yeah, we've got a situation."
38028,bartlet,Yeah?
38029,c.j.,Rueters has the Ayatollah's son youngest son just left Afghanistan on a C-130. Is he  coming here for a heart transplant?
38030,bartlet,Heart and lung.
38031,c.j.,I'm assuming we knew about this.
38032,bartlet,Knew about it? We did it.
38033,c.j.,The Ayatollah's issued a statement.
38034,bartlet,What kind?
38035,c.j.,"Denouncing it. Bitterly denouncing it, sir. ""Our nation can take care of its own.  Interfernce from the West is an affront to Islam."""
38036,bartlet,What's the room saying?
38037,c.j.,"They think we're hiding Leo's meeting with the Swiss. So, you know, the press coffee..."
38038,bartlet,Can't do it now.
38039,c.j.,Yes. You're right.
38040,leo, I need you to step out just a moment.
38041,c.j.,"Sure. Thank you, Mr. President."
38042,bartlet,We're not going to not do it. I'm saying just now.
38043,c.j.,I'm with you.
38044,bartlet,"Hi. Before you say anything, here's my idea: the kid needs lungs and a heart. Let's  use the Ayatollah's. What are you smiling at?"
38045,leo,"I'm sorry, it's... I'm sorry, sir. It's the little note Margaret passed on. "
38046,bartlet,"""The Iranians, they've taken to the streets."" Perfect. That goes to the Margaret Museum."
38047,leo,Please don't forget all politics are local.
38048,bartlet,"Ah, bite me."
38049,leo,He's got to say something...
38050,bartlet,Please.
38051,leo,He's got to say something to his hard-liners.
38052,bartlet,"He didn't want to try, ""My son is dying and these guys maybe can fix him? And maybe  if our citizens didn't spend quite so much energy denouncing the infidels, they'd have  time to build a damn medical school!"""
38053,leo,The Swiss talked to the NGO who talked to the brother-in-law who speaks for the ayatollah.
38054,bartlet,"Okay, but just tell me they weren't using cellular technology, 'cause I don't care what  anybody says, it doesn't work yet."
38055,leo,Think about linking it to the missile test.
38056,bartlet,What do you mean?
38057,leo,Send a communiqué through the Swiss. The Ayatollah's got to honor Bahrain. Stop all  tests of the Shehab-3. 
38058,bartlet,He's going to say no.
38059,leo,Then that's when you tell him you're going to turn the plane around.
38060,bartlet,No.
38061,leo,I said you threaten to turn the plane around.
38062,bartlet,No. Come on! That's a fifteen-year-old non-combatant on his way to a hospital. I want  you to pretend that plane's got a big red cross on it.
38063,leo,They perfect medium-range missiles.
38064,bartlet,I understand.
38065,leo,What's that do for hearts and lungs?
38066,bartlet,"Send the communiqué, absolutely. There's a Bahrain Agreement that says... send it.  Tell them to stop. Don't even come close... I don't even want a scent of linkage to  it. A big damn red cross right on that plane."
38067,josh,I have this problem I'm trying to put in prospective.
38069,josh,Triplehorn thinks I'm a secret operative for Hoynes.
38071,josh,I don't believe I am.
38073,josh,What?
38075,josh,Thank merciful God.
38077,josh,The rice?
38079,josh,"They eat a lot of rice, Donna."
38080,josh,"Mrs. Rackley borrowed $1500 from Judy Vanderbass to buy a hand-carved teak bed frame  for $2000, which is a good price."
38081,josh,And?
38083,josh,Making it a great price.
38085,josh,"What do you mean, ""Josh""?"
38087,josh,And I told the State Department to look after him. I didn't want him to get in any trouble.
38089,josh,See if they'll return yours.
38090,josh,Toby. Triplehorn's on fire.
38091,toby,He needs to build a case against our...
38092,josh,Hoynes is lining up precinct captains in Iowa and New Hampshire.
38093,toby,This is like ten minute after the polls close in California.
38094,josh,And Winnick just called. It's probably the same thing. Half the Senate's going to be  running. If it looks like we're giving Hoynes the keys...
38095,toby,Yeah. We got to back him off.
38096,josh,"Okay, devil's advocate. Isn't Hoynes entitled?"
38097,toby,"Yeah, but not yet."
38098,josh,"We got him on the ticket by convincing him it's not his turn. We kept him out of the  center ring 'cause it wasn't his turn, and now..."
38099,toby,There aren't any turns.
38100,toby,Hey.
38101,leo,So... these two people rob a Starbucks near Seattle; half an hour they serve coffee to  make more money. Know when they make their getaway?
38102,toby,When business slows down.
38103,leo,Beat that. When's Josh meeting with Hoynes?
38104,toby,Soon.
38105,leo,What do you need?
38106,toby,Alternate Federal Co-Chair of the Apalachian Regional Commision.
38107,leo,What about it?
38108,toby,It's Senate-confirmable.
38109,leo,Really?
38110,toby,So is Commissioner of Hopi Indian Relocation.
38111,leo,"Let me tell you something about this job, you need a deep bench."
38112,toby,Inspector General of the Railroad Retirement Board. Director of the Institute of  Museum Studies...
38113,leo,My job's not.
38114,toby,"Ginger beat you to that joke, and Karen lost her job because of us."
38115,leo,What do you want me to do?
38116,toby,Start getting used to the fact that we won in a landslide. We can show some fight  on this.
38117,leo,"Ernest went down for the gun ban, Janice for taxes..."
38118,toby,This is different. We asked her to introduce the bill.
38119,leo,And she knew that. It's called a trial balloon.
38120,toby,"Yeah, but it's also called a recorded vote. She did that kind of thing for us. She was  our gal on the back bench."
38121,leo,She did everything short of pouring lighter fluid on the Republican leadership. They're  not going to confirm her. They're going to make us look bad doing it and we still got a  half a new Cabinet to confirm.
38122,leo,Thanks.  The Hopi relocation guy?
38123,toby,Yeah.
38124,bartlet,Laney says the plane's still six hours out.
38125,leo,What?
38126,leo,What are you talking about?
38127,bartlet,What are you talking about?
38128,bartlet,Where's he?
38129,leo,Rapelling up or repelling down?
38130,bartlet,"It's in Pakistan, what does it matter?"
38131,leo,It's not in Pakistan; you only think it is.
38132,bartlet,"Okay, but if I need a life-saving procedure, can you make sure the surgeon's suffering  from massive oxygen deprivation?"
38133,leo,Who's the third?
38134,bartlet,"Aw, don't tell me."
38135,bartlet,"The one guy who can save his son and he tortured his father. That's just bad staff work.  Charlie! Are we sure about Japan? I mean, one of these days they're going to find the  fairway, right?"
38136,bartlet,Would you pull the First Lady out of whatever she's in right now?
38137,bartlet,"Well, put on a helmet and pads and get in there."
38138,leo,"Make sure Mohebi's sitting by a phone. He takes an elevator, we know the number."
38139,bartlet,That's it.
38140,josh,The National Committee's got a list of the State Party conventions where we ask the  Vice President to take our slot. Could you get that for me?
38142,josh,And the DPC sent me this list of his budget roll-outs and it's for last year. I need  all four.
38144,josh,What?
38146,josh,I can't...
38148,josh,You just called them deadbeat.
38150,josh,"Well, good one, Gracie."
38152,josh,Me.
38154,josh,Everything you just said in there was a good thing and just by saying it like Ethel  Mertz doesn't make it...
38156,josh,"A buck and a half, $161,200 for the leadership."
38158,josh,"Okay... I know you like to hit with me but you've got to go sit in the back of the class  'cause you just suggested that making only a $150,000 was reasonable justification for  committing a felony. Which is what it is, Lulu."
38160,josh, It's To Sir With Love.
38166,bartlet,"Hey, Terry."
38167,bartlet,Yeah.
38169,bartlet,No need to thank me. Whatever happened to Mrs. Wilburforce?
38171,bartlet,Really?
38173,bartlet,What they hell are you talking about?
38175,bartlet,Wasn't Mrs. Wilberforce our cat?
38177,bartlet,Really? All right. Eisenmenger's Syndrome.
38179,bartlet,The Ayatollah's son has it.
38181,bartlet,"No, but I'm concerned about spousal abuse."
38183,bartlet,The only doctor available won't do it.
38185,bartlet,Persian.
38187,bartlet,Abbey...
38189,bartlet,I can't order him to do it.
38191,bartlet,Through the power vested in me by you?
38193,bartlet,"Just for the record, this is why we don't talk about foreign policy. Which we do, and  you don't think we do it enough."
38195,bartlet,Because Samuel Mudd was tried and convicted of treason for setting that leg.
38197,bartlet,What 'so'?
38199,bartlet,The patient right in front of them?
38201,bartlet,All right. Go back to the sewing thing.
38203,josh,"Yeah, I don't get Hawaii. Great weather, great beaches, universal health care... I'm  waiting for the other shoe to drop."
38204,josh,Sure.
38205,josh,Because if he went home without a tan...
38206,josh,We got to talk politics.
38207,josh,We need you to stop shopping for precinct captains.
38208,josh,"We're days after an election, we've got to govern. It's too early..."
38209,josh,Triplehorn alone can tie us in knots.
38210,josh,"You've got a Constitutional obligation, that comes first."
38211,josh,"We need these two years. It's our last chance to govern, John..."
38212,josh,There are going to be lots of ways...
38213,josh,What's that supposed to mean?
38214,josh,Half this town's going to be runnung. I do the President's politics. He can't govern  if I'm seen as...
38215,josh,What?
38216,bartlet,"""The boy's on the plane. He's experiencing pulmonary hypertension."" That's elevated  pressure in the lungs, I think. That could lead to what? Doctor, that could lead to what?"
38217,bartlet,That cold lead to what?
38218,bartlet,That's what it says here. Follow me.
38219,bartlet,"That's right, and he has something called in situ thrombi."
38220,bartlet,"Dr. Mohebi, I don't care. Why aren't you scrubbing up?"
38221,bartlet,I know.
38222,bartlet,Doctor...
38223,bartlet,I know this. Don't you think I know?
38224,bartlet,I'll let you know who the enemy is. That's my job. It's not a 15-year-old boy.
38225,bartlet,Doctors Without Borders.
38226,bartlet,I do know these people. You're crazy if you don't think I do.
38227,bartlet,Doctor...
38228,bartlet,Nothing will happen to them.
38229,bartlet,Nothing will happen to them.
38230,bartlet,"Well, the Swiss, I guess. Look, I'll use every power of the office to protect you and  your family, of course I will. Can I just say that this is how things change for the  better? A world-class surgeon or a schoolteacher in Afjah who questions the ayatollah's  divine power. Do me a favor, Doctor, go back to Smith-Lansing and look at the kid,  'cause I think when you do, you're going to scrub up. If you don't, I respect that,  and the man made his own bed. Okay?"
38231,bartlet,What was your father's name?
38232,bartlet,What'd he teach?
38233,bartlet,Thank you. Get him to Baltimore.
38234,leo,"You think cell phones, maybe?"
38235,josh,"Not whitewater rafting. And staff can't make those calls. They're top-tier Iowa people,  and New Hampshire. Forty, fifty calls from the Flathead River?"
38236,leo,That really doesn't seem possible. Unless...
38237,josh,That's what I'm saying.
38238,leo,All right. I'll take it.
38239,josh,What do I tell Triplehorn?
38240,leo,Tell him it's done.
38241,toby,"Thank you, no. I..."
38242,toby,You can't have the job.
38243,toby,The parks bill... we made it Senate-confirmable.
38244,toby,They added it in conference. We'll find something. I don't know what.
38245,toby,Can't be Museum Studies. God forbid the Senate falls out of the mix on that.
38246,toby,"We asked you to fight a losing... Yes, we owe you."
38247,toby,I called the play. I called it.
38248,toby,It was a loser and I pushed to have you introduce it anyway.
38249,toby,"Well, look, let's just..."
38250,toby,"And, clearly, that argument took the nation by storm."
38251,toby,"Yeah, but I'm the Romans."
38252,sam,Thank you.
38253,sam,Okay. Do you happen to know if the President's still in the office?
38254,sam,Thanks.
38255,bartlet,Sure.
38256,sam," Good evening, sir."
38257,bartlet,You're the nominee.
38258,sam,There's no nominee. Everyone's on the ballot.
38259,bartlet,Is there another Democrat?
38260,sam,No.
38261,bartlet,You're the nominee.
38262,sam,Yeah.
38263,bartlet,And I know how you feel. You like Scott Holcomb?
38264,sam,I don't know him well.
38265,bartlet,He's terrific.
38266,sam,There's a good guy out there named Will Bailey if he should come across your radar.
38267,bartlet,You're going to campaign on prescription drugs?
38268,sam,"Our prescription drug bill-- yes, sir-- and our Medicare reforms and the Bartlet  Energy Plan."
38269,bartlet,Sam.
38270,sam,"Yes, sir?"
38271,bartlet,It's okay to run away from me when you need to.
38272,sam,"I would never, Mr. President. I simply would never do that. That's not how I'm getting  votes."
38273,bartlet,I appreciate that but that's not what I'm talking about. You disagreed with me on  Medicare. I remember the meeting right here. Then you wrote a five-page memo. Run  towards yourself. I'm wrong about that. Walk. You're not going to be used to your  surroundings.
38274,sam,"Yes, sir."
38275,bartlet,"You lose, you lose, but if you waste this, I'll kill you. I'll just kill you, Sam."
38276,sam,"Yes, sir."
38277,bartlet,Anything else?
38278,sam,"Thank you, Mr. President. "
38279,leo,"Good evening, Mr. President."
38280,bartlet,Hey.
38281,leo,Thank-you notes?
38282,bartlet,Yeah. I'm going to bed.
38283,leo,"You don't really like making thank-you calls, do you?"
38284,bartlet,Spill it.
38285,leo,How many precinct captians did you line up for Hoynes?
38286,bartlet,I didn't line up...
38287,leo,Forty-seven. Charlie showed me the call sheets.
38288,bartlet,I said thanks on the behalf of the ticket. I can't help it if...
38289,leo,Yeah.
38290,bartlet,They'll thank whatever they want.
38291,leo,"Well, they think you're freezing the race for Hoynes."
38292,bartlet,I'm freezing it for us. We just won four more years. It's not time for a free-for-all.
38293,leo,This shouldn't be what you do anymore.
38294,bartlet,Do I call them all back?
38295,leo,We'll take care of it.
38296,bartlet,All right.
38297,leo,Tehran's going to accelerate medium-range missile tests by two weeks.
38298,bartlet,Yeah.
38299,leo,We'll gather the NSC principles in the morning.
38300,bartlet,All right. Anything else?
38301,leo,Salmon Afkham was wheeled in surgery 15 minutes ago.
38302,bartlet,"Well, Mohebi's day just started."
38303,leo,"Well, I suppose there are worse ways for ours to end."
38304,bartlet,"Yeah, that's right."
38305,c.j.,"Good morning, sir."
38306,bartlet,What's up?
38307,c.j.,You're going to hear a story.
38308,bartlet,Uh-huh. I am a character in this story?
38309,c.j.,"Well, I suppose that's up to you. A navy pilot, lieutenant commander Vickie Hilton  has been taken under arrest by the military police as being charged by the judge  advocate with having an affair with a married officer, an inferior, a lieutenant-jg."
38310,bartlet,I don't see being a character.
38311,c.j.,"Well, heads up anyway."
38312,bartlet,Thank you.
38313,leo,"Good morning, sir."
38314,bartlet,Hey.
38315,leo,How'd it go?
38316,bartlet,Could have gone better. I didn't think adultery was against the uniform code.
38317,leo,You're talking about Vickie Hilton?
38318,bartlet,Yeah. It's against military law?
38319,leo,"No. They don't like fraternization, but her thing isn't the affair, it's failure  to follow an order."
38320,bartlet,They told her to stop?
38321,leo,Yeah.
38322,bartlet,What can she get?
38323,leo,She could go to jail for two years.
38324,bartlet,For failure to follow an order?
38325,leo,Sure.
38326,bartlet,We shold have that here.
38327,bartlet,"Good morning, Mr. Secretary, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the final Cabinet  meeting of Bartlet one. I don't know if this is true, but a Presidential historian  told me that this was the most stable cabinet since Hoover's. Which is nice, but you  got to think, how many other jobs were really available? But here are facts. You  created over nine million new jobs, and the highest home-ownership rate on record.  More than 150 new trade agreements. You created the largest expansion of college aid  since the GI Bill. Cleaned up over 500 toxic waste dumps. And you did it all while  eliminating 16,000 pages of federal regulations. Not bad for government work. Thank you."
38328,leo,"I'll add my thanks, and I'll need your letters of resignation by 7:00."
38329,c.j.,We are. I think all the Bahrain signatories are and we're expressing our concern  through the appropriate multilateral channels. John.
38330,c.j.,"I can tell you that he's been working out some new material and that it has absolutely  been destroying on the campuses. Of course, Showtime will have their cameras at APEC  to record the whole thing for the President's one-hour special called Bartlet: In the  Thick of It. "
38331,c.j.,"No. I'll finish with a little housekeeping for those who don't know. In a two-term  Presidency, as a matter of courtesy, the President's cabinet resigns without being  asked, giving the President the option of hiring them or not, rather than firing  them or not. Those resignations will be submitted today. That's all. Thanks."
38332,c.j.,Yeah.
38333,c.j.,Sure. About what?
38334,c.j.,What's wrong?
38335,c.j.,"Sorry, I forgot. I moved the news magazines to the fourth row."
38336,c.j.,"It isn't a thing, Mitch. There are cameras in here now that are framing part of the  gallery and not just the podium and the news magazines aren't here everyday so the  camera's getting a couple of empty seats."
38337,c.j.,"Yeah, but we're safe after row three, so I put you guys in four."
38338,c.j.,"Well, I certainly didn't mean it as one."
38339,c.j.,"Mitch, I put you in the very first row I don't care about. Of the things I don't  care about, I put you right up front. I'll see you later."
38340,toby,You should amend that in a statement to say that the resignations are effective  whenever they are effective.
38341,c.j.,I did.
38342,toby,Okay.
38343,c.j.,He's going to remember he doesn't say a word about labor without running it past of  the local AFL?
38344,toby,Yeah.
38345,c.j.,Is he?
38346,toby,Yeah.
38347,c.j.,And he's got to go door-to-door. He hasn't lived there since he was 18.
38348,toby,He knows.
38349,c.j.,"Speaking of which, high school snapshots."
38350,toby,He knows.
38351,toby,You're taking the Lakers banner?
38352,sam,Yeah.
38353,toby,"'Cause there's a shortage of them in Southern California? Leave it, and leave  the stapler."
38354,sam,It's a West Wing office. Someone's going to use it for 90 days.
38355,toby,And they might need a stapler. It's ours.
38356,sam,Right.
38357,toby,You've logged a lot of miles in the last couple of weeks.
38358,sam,"Well, I had to go get nominated and then set up the office and then meet every member  of the California Democratic Party. Listen, there is no way I'm going to be able to  help with this, which is worse for me then it is for you, but there's never going to  be the time."
38359,toby,Wasn't counting on it.
38360,sam,Are you going to use Michael?
38361,toby,From the staff?
38362,sam,Yeah.
38363,toby,Michael's who you use when you need brief remarks to whoever wrote the check we  couldn't turn down.
38364,sam,What about Jerry?
38365,toby,Jerry's who you use when you can't get Michael. there's no one on the speech writing  staff who could do this. It's okay.
38366,sam,That's a pretty big job to do by yourself.
38367,toby,You're going to remember the local AFL?
38368,sam,Yeah.
38369,toby,You got to go door-to-door.
38370,sam,I know.
38371,toby,You were 18 when you lived there.
38372,sam,You want a hug?
38373,toby,Put the banner back. See you next week.
38374,josh,There are some new people.
38376,josh,Which is good.
38378,josh,I'm not one to give fashion advice...
38380,josh,But one of them...
38382,josh,"...one of them is wearing a... a, uh... a Star Trek pin. Is today a special Star Trek  holiday or something?"
38384,josh,"Okay, well, then would you find out? And is it's not, you know people walk through  here and it's not the most confidence-inspiring sight to see in a White House employee,  so if you could ask her to..."
38386,josh,Yeah. Can I have my briefing memo? 
38387,josh,Thank you.
38389,josh,"You're... almost there, but you're not quite getting it. When it's something you're  paid to do, that's not a favor. What do you got?"
38391,josh,"Wow, I'm definately not going to do that."
38393,josh,"Aren't those basically women who've come up to you and said ""Is that Josh Lyman?"""
38395,josh,And you said...?
38397,josh,"Well, I'll properly I.D. you for him, no problem."
38399,josh,"I can't, Potsie. Ralph and I are double-dating the Dubrusky twins."
38401,josh,That's true.
38403,josh,Yes.
38405,josh," Hey, what are you doing here?"
38408,josh, What's the meeting about?
38410,josh,Yes. 
38411,josh, I know what the meeting's about.
38412,josh,There's no way the White House is going to get involved in it. It's a military thing.
38413,josh,And the Commander-in-Chief chooses not to overrule his commanders.
38414,josh,"Yes, 'cause then when he says no, I got a problem with women."
38415,josh,"What happened to ""I came wielding nothing""?"
38416,josh," ""Evidently, you did, too."""
38417,josh,"All right, we'll talk in 15 minutes."
38418,josh,Shut up.
38419,leo," Oh, God help me somedays."
38420,sam,You really don't have to do that anymore.
38422,sam,"Hey, where you going? Where'd you finally settle on?"
38424,sam,Excellent! I like to stay at the Hotel Beau Rivage but I think that's going to be  a little pricey for you.
38426,sam,Yeah. This is a family connection?
38428,sam,"All of Europe's a family connection for you, isn't it?"
38430,sam,When's the plane leave?
38432,sam,"Yeah, listen, I wouldn't ask you to postpone your vacation if it wasn't important."
38434,sam,"Well, I'm obviously about to right now."
38436,sam,Toby Ziegler needs your help on a speech he's writing for the President.
38438,sam,"Not everybody does this kind of speechwriting. And at this particular moment, not  anybody over there does this kind of speechwriting."
38440,sam,No.
38442,sam,"I would, Will, but I don't work there at the moment."
38444,sam,We'll you're not done yet.
38446,sam,January 20th.
38448,sam,"No, just the Inauguration."
38450,sam,"Yeah, 'cause of the Tillman speech. You're flying in that direction anyway, thought  you could meet in Washington and meet with Toby."
38452,sam,I'll set up the appointment.
38454,sam," Give this to Toby Ziegler when you get there, okay?"
38456,c.j.,"No, I definately wouldn't. The President's fully commited to Kyoto and thinks it's  time we began adopting to the impact of greenhouse gases is all. Mark?"
38457,c.j.,I'm just going to stop you right there direct you to the Pentagon. Mitch.
38458,c.j.,"Well, we already discussed that but if you want to talk to me more in my office..."
38459,c.j.,"Well, it's my house, Mitch. But, as a matter of fact, I consulted with the White House  Correspondent's Association."
38460,c.j.,Or you attitude. But that's not why I changed the seating. Thank you.
38461,josh," Okay, I'm going to see Fitzwallace."
38463,josh,"Hey, I see she's not wearing the pin anymore. Thanks."
38465,josh,Why?
38467,josh,All right. Hang on.
38468,josh,Hi. I'm Josh Lyman.
38469,josh,"Yeah, the reason why I wanted you to take off the pin is just around the White House,  you understand..."
38470,josh,I'm sorry?
38471,josh,"Right, except Stacy works for me."
38472,josh,No.
38474,josh,"Shhh, shhh, shhh."
38476,josh,"She is... well, one of the special people."
38478,josh,She's taken off the pin. We're going to let it be.
38480,josh,That's right. What do you think about this Vickie Hilton problem?
38482,josh,"No, I mean about whether it's right for the White House to be involved."
38484,josh,You've got to go faster next time. I'm here already.
38486,josh,"Mr. Chairman, thank you. Hope you haven't been waiting."
38487,josh,"Yeah, there's going to be pressure from women for the President to intercede, and  I was hoping we could find a way to intercede without involving the President."
38488,josh,"I understand. I guess also, the thing is she isn't just any pilot. She's like Jackie  Robinson. She's busted a lot of barriers. She's the first woman at Miramar, first  woman to fly the F-14 Tomcat, she teaches on an F-14. I guess at this point I don't  have to give you her résumé."
38489,josh,"Just out of curiosity, if you could step in, would you save her?"
38490,josh,I have to tell you it just doesn't seem right to me.
38491,josh,"Admiral, you know I have all the respect in the world for you, right?"
38492,josh,"And if I didn't, I'd respect the unifrom, the rank and the position anyway?"
38493,josh,I feel like I have to go to Leo.
38494,toby,Yeah.
38496,toby,"Oh, we have an appointment, right?"
38498,toby,Come on in. Sit down.
38500,toby,Will Bailey.
38502,toby,"So, you want a job on the speechwriting staff?"
38504,toby,You want a job on the speechwriting staff.
38506,toby,I'm sorry?
38508,toby,You're Will Bailey.
38510,toby,Sam told me you wanted to see me about a job on the speech writing staff.
38512,toby,He did?
38514,toby,Sam's doing a little matchmaking. I'm fine doing this by myself.
38516,toby,Yeah.
38518,toby," Yeah, it's not personal a speech like this. Obviously it takes a certain  amount of experience and, uh..."
38519,toby,"...and uh, a certain something."
38521,toby,'Cause you don't have the experience.
38523,toby,You too.
38525,toby,I read the Stanford Club speech. I thought it was good. Not as good as other people  thought it was.
38527,toby,"Call and response isn't going to work in front of a Joint Session. You're alliteration  happy: ""guardians of gridlock,"" ""protectors of privilege."" I needed an avalanche of  Advil. And when you use pop-culture references, your speech has a shelf life of twelve  minutes. You don't mind constructive criticism, do you? "
38529,toby,"Anyway, thanks for coming in. I told Sam I can do this by myself."
38531,toby,"A 500-word stanza on American leadership in a globally interdependent age that moves  beyond triumphalism by this time tomorrow. If it's 501, don't show it to me."
38532,leo,"I need a favor: the President's gonna be getting a phone call and I don't want him to  take it, and I don't want him to know why."
38533,leo,"The U.N. has had a decades-old conflict with New York City. Foreign diplomats will  park anywhere they want, and they get tickets."
38534,leo,Don't pay them. And that's where are action begins 'cause every once in a while the  city goes on a jihad and starts towing all their cars and that's just happened.
38535,leo,Yes.
38536,leo,The Secretary-General.
38537,leo,"Yeah, could you swing that?"
38538,leo,"I gotta keep the knucklehead stuff off his desk, and this is worse. This is actually  hot-button knucklehead. This could be a thing. If he knows why the Secretary's calling,  he's going to lose it and he's going to be in it."
38539,leo,What do you think about Vickie Hilton?
38540,leo,Thank you.
38541,toby,Hey.
38542,toby, You wanted to see me.
38543,leo,I did. Because I read a set of brief remarks for the Better Housing Conferences.
38544,toby,Is that something you usually read?
38545,leo,No.
38546,toby,Why were you reading it?
38547,leo,Because it's not something I usually read. I noticed that the writing has a quality  that you don't usually find in remarks of this nature. Usually it's written by one  of the guys in the shop.
38548,toby,We're a little shorthanded over there. I did it myself.
38549,leo,"Well, instead of FHA insured home loans, you wrote FEMA insured home loans."
38550,toby,I meant FHA.
38551,leo,"Yeah, 'cause FEMA doesn't insure home loans. They don't insure anything. They're the  people who come in after a tornado."
38552,toby,I know that.
38553,leo,What do you want to do with Sam gone for three months?
38554,toby,We talked about this.
38555,leo,As long as you still know what you're doing.
38556,toby,"The adjustment period with me, for a new person..."
38557,leo,You adjusted to Sam.
38558,toby,"Maybe, and if I did, it was like, a week ago. "
38559,leo,"Still, you could try to..."
38560,toby,Who? Who would you get?
38561,leo,There are people out there.
38562,toby,"There are not people who... You're like the guys who say, ""Are you telling me you  could only find one African-American speechwriter good enough to work at the White  House?"" I'm amazed I found that many. ""Good enough to work at the White House"" is a  pretty small population to begin with. And guys who can write entire sections of a  State of the Union? I'd be as surprised if there were as many as nine of us. Sam was  one of them."
38563,leo,Okay. What do you think about Vickie Hilton?
38564,toby,I think we invested time and money teaching her how to fly a warplane which turns out  she does very well and there aren't that many who do. So I'm going to go ahead and  pick national security over caring who she sleeps with.
38565,leo,Josh talked to me today.
38566,toby,It can't go in the Oval Office.
38567,leo,"No, it can't."
38568,toby,It can't.
38569,leo,Except I have a woman problem.
38570,toby,Is Jordan pestering you? 'Cause I'm getting it from Andy on this day and night.
38571,leo,"No, Toby, I meant a woman's issue. The constiteuncy of women."
38572,toby,Yeah.
38573,leo,Though Jordy hasn't shut up about Vickie Hilton.
38574,toby,This is what I'm saying.
38575,leo,All right.
38576,toby,Thank you.
38577,leo,Thanks.
38578,bartlet,"Okay, thank you.  What the hell is going on with the seats in the briefing room?"
38579,c.j.,"I wouldn't worry about it, Mr. President."
38580,bartlet,"I'm not worried about it, but I just read about it."
38581,c.j.,"The news magazines aren't here every day and the empty seats don't look good on camera,  so I moved them to the fourth row. I think you shouldn't comment on it."
38582,bartlet,I'll comment on it. I'll say sit your ass where you're told and get back to work.
38583,c.j.,"Yeah, and I don't think you should do that."
38584,bartlet,Yeah.
38585,bartlet,Thanks.
38586,bartlet,I'm sorry?
38587,bartlet,Okay.  We'll have to return.
38588,bartlet," Anyway, you're going to take care of it?"
38589,c.j.,I'm going to have a camera positioned moved.
38590,bartlet,"Well, I'm sorry to hear you caving, but whatever."
38591,c.j.,"Yeah, I'm not caving, sir."
38592,bartlet,"Well, okay, but still, whatever."
38593,bartlet,Come on in.
38594,bartlet,Thanks.  This is Jack Reese. He's working for Nancy. This is Josh  Lyman and C.J. Cregg.
38595,c.j.,Commander.
38596,josh,How are you?
38597,bartlet,They're talking about a force level data-fusion network.
38598,bartlet,Nancy thinks France will come around after the North Sea exercise.
38599,bartlet,You agree?
38600,bartlet,Okay. Thanks very much everybody.
38601,bartlet,Thank you.
38602,josh,Commander?
38603,josh,"Hi, I'm Josh Lyman. We just met in there."
38604,josh,"This conversation you and I are having right now, it was not my idea to have it.  This must be distinctly understood."
38605,josh,You've meet my assistant Donna.
38606,josh,"Well, if you like that, she nearly got arrested once when she got her arm stuck in a  mailbox trying to retrieve a letter she wrote to Ilie Nastase. She once left her  underpants at an art opening and, after a summit in Belarus, she tried to smuggle  11 scented Minsk candles into an overnnight bag. They evecuated the terminal."
38607,josh,Yeah.
38608,josh,No.
38609,josh,"You, too."
38611,josh,Perfect timing.
38613,josh,I just talked to him.
38615,josh,Yeah.
38617,josh,I think I did well. I think I fanned the flame.
38619,josh,I think he does.
38621,josh,He said he thought it was cool that you were looking for someone to trade votes.
38623,josh,I told him there are plenty more where that came from.
38625,josh,I told him about Ilie Nastase.
38627,josh,What do you mean?
38629,josh,I thought it went with the vote swapping theme.
38631,josh,The scented Minsk candles.
38633,josh,These are endearing stories.
38635,josh,"When you were trying to get the job, you were pretending that you'd already gotten  the job, so it's not like your underwear at an art gallery was going to change my mind."
38637,josh,"Again, endearing."
38639,josh,I think the underwear on the floor speaks for itself.
38641,josh,Why?
38643,josh,"Maybe, but he's not going to care."
38645,josh,Guys will go out with anybody.
38647,josh,I'm not gonna...
38649,josh,"Okay, but I'm going to work for a while on making people's lives better."
38652,bartlet,You're going to talk to Berryhill?
38653,leo,"Yes, sir."
38654,bartlet,He wants to feel loved.
38655,leo,Yes.
38656,bartlet,You'll make him feel loved? I want him in the Cabinet.
38657,leo,"Yeah, he's going to feel all kinds of love."
38658,bartlet,Thank you.
38659,leo,Josh saw me yesterday about Vickie Hilton.
38660,bartlet,You think we should get involved?
38661,leo,"No, but you're gonna have problems with the women."
38662,bartlet,Abbey and the girls?
38663,leo,No.
38664,bartlet,Women?
38665,leo,Yes.
38666,bartlet,"'Cause I got to tell you, I've been hearing it from Abbey and the girls."
38667,leo,I'm sure.
38668,bartlet,What do you think?
38669,leo,It stays out of the Oval Office.
38670,bartlet,"No, I meant about Vickie Hilton."
38671,leo,She disobeyed an order. You can't do that.
38672,bartlet,"Sure. Yes, but isn't there some question as to whether it's practical to give that order  in the first place?"
38673,leo,You want pilots overruling their superiors with regard to what's practical and what's not?
38674,bartlet,"No, I'm just saying there are few side to this."
38675,leo,"That's for sure, and you just heard mine."
38676,bartlet,But we'll hear no others because we don't want it in the Oval Office.
38677,leo,Right.
38678,bartlet,Okay. Anything else?
38679,leo,"Thank you, Mr. President."
38680,c.j.,Mitch...
38681,c.j.,I hope you weren't waiting.
38682,c.j.,"Well, you win, I lose. I don't want this to be a story. I want the President to be  able to function. I'm moving the news magazines back up front and I apologize."
38683,c.j.,"When you're not here, there'll be a sign on your chair with you name and the name of  your publication. I've given C-SPAN permission for a second camera position that's on  your seat so the braodcast director can go there at his or her discretion."
38684,c.j.,"No. If you're not here, you better get a seat filler and they better be prepared  'cause they are going to be called on for the honor of the first question. This  should be about other people, don't you think?"
38685,c.j.,"I know. Happy Thanksgiving, Mitch."
38686,c.j.,"By the way, Danny Concannon won a Pulitzer prize from the fourth row."
38687,c.j.,"See you, Mitch."
38688,josh,I'm really sorry to bother you.
38689,josh,What are you working on?
38690,josh,You ever been there?
38691,josh,What's it like?
38692,josh,Really?  No. There's no symphony or... people.
38693,josh,"Listen, it occurs to me that, uh... you know, I mentioned Donna before and it occurs  to me that I told you that I named some things that tickled me. I... I don't know.  I certainly wouldn't want to leave you with the impression that she was... you know...  Anyway, if you wanted to ask her out, she'd probably say yes."
38694,josh,"""In between anything""?"
38695,josh,"No, no, no."
38696,josh,Sure. Tell me your aide's name. I'll ask her out. We'll double.
38697,josh,I got the fuzzy end of that lolipop.
38698,josh,"So, that's it. We're done talking about Donna. Whose full name is Donnatella, by  the way. Mom's Italian... Dad's Irish. Okay. Thanks."
38699,bartlet,He's wrong. Leo's wrong. Are we to live with the assumption that there are no men  in the services who've commited adultery? I don't know what's worse: being stupid  or pretending to be stupid. Tell him that.
38700,bartlet,"No, I'm going to do it."
38701,bartlet,"Eisenhower and Kay Summersby, a subordinate. Hammond with the wives of two junior  officers. So, G.I. Jane gets a court-martial? G.I. Joe gets a short film on hygeine?  That is all I have to say to you. "
38702,bartlet,I forgot to tell him something else.
38703,leo,"The Uniform Code of Military Justice, Article 134 which exist to ensure that soldiers  will risk their lives for each other. I think you'll agree that, without that there  isn't much point in having Articles 1 through 133. Nobody ordered Eisenhower to stop  seeing Summersby."
38704,bartlet,That's right. Because men don't give that order to other men.
38705,leo,"Excuse me, but did you not fire our Ambassador to somewhere in South America-- I can't  remember-- 'cause he was messing around with..."
38706,bartlet,"The daughter of the president of Brazil, which presented a politcal prblem for me.  Also, I didn't fire him, I asked him to resign. And I set him up in the private sector.  And if you think the differnce is semantics, look up dishonorable discharge in there.  Look up Fort Leavenworth."
38707,bartlet,Yeah.
38708,bartlet,I read the memo on Rwanda. Average rainfall nine inches. That's the memo Toby wanted  me to read?
38709,leo,I told him to pass-block on the call.
38710,bartlet,Why?
38711,leo,Parking tickets. 
38712,leo,"Now please, don't leap into it. Don't..."
38713,bartlet," There are big signs! You can't park there! They should get towed! I hope  they get towed to Queens and the Triboro is closed and there's a big craft show at Shea,  a flea market or a tractor show! "
38714,bartlet,Damn it.
38715,bartlet,Do you really think that Vicky Hilton is unable to distinguish between this order  and a combat order?
38716,leo,"This was combat order. They're all combat orders! When you order a guy to go fight,  the guy can't think it's 'cause you're sleeping with his wife."
38717,bartlet,You're right.
38718,leo,"That's... an unusual phrase for you, sir. Did you just learn it?"
38719,bartlet,"Well, you didn't let me finish."
38720,leo,I had a hunch.
38721,bartlet,"I may also be right. We get five more people in here, I think we're going to have  eight opinions."
38722,leo,That's right.
38723,bartlet,So let's.
38724,leo,It's Pentagon.
38725,bartlet,"And two elections in a row, people said they wanted me to run that."
38726,leo,There are issues of chain of command and command influence.
38727,bartlet,"Right now, I'm not talking about overruling anyone or pardoning anyone. Right now,  I'm just talking about having people over and asking questions. I like basketball,  but I can't play. I don't know why. I played in prep school and I liked being on  the team, but I didn't want the ball and the coach said, ""Jed, winners always want  the ball."" I said, ""Coach, winners are also better then I am."" He said, ""Son, to  be a winner, you've got to think like a winner."" I said, ""Coach, to be a winner,  you've also got to be better than I am."" Anyway, he was right. Winners want the ball.  I don't think I ever want to hear it's too sticky for the Oval Office.  What are you smiling at?"
38728,leo,Nothing.
38729,bartlet,"Are we together on this? Do we have resolve? We've got four years, no election and a  Republican Congress that hates me and actually hates you more. You ready to saddle up?"
38730,leo,"Well, I serve at the President's pleasure... and it's kind of nice for me to."
38731,bartlet,All right. Good then. Happy Thanksgiving.
38732,josh,Hey. I think he's going to call you.
38734,josh,What time is it?
38736,josh,Sure.
38738,josh,"Have a good time. Those are good stories about you, though. Those stories would make  me like you."
38740,josh,Tomorrow's Thanksgiving.
38742,josh,"I meant, you won't be coming in early tomorrow. You won't be coming in at all."
38744,josh,"No, I'm just saying..."
38746,josh,You too.
38747,josh,I'm sorry?
38748,josh,What's your name again?
38749,josh,"I'm a fan. I'm a sports fan, I'm a music fan and I'm a Star Trek fan. All of them.  But here's what I don't do. Tell me if any of this sounds familiar: ""Let's list our  ten favorite episodes. Let's list our least favorite episodes. Let's list our favorite  galaxies. Let's make a chart to see how often our favorite galaxies appear in our  favorite episodes. What Romulan would you most like to see coupled with a Cardassian  and why? Let's spend a weekend talking about Romulans falling in love with Cardassians  and then let's do it again."" That's not being a fan. That's having a fetish. And I don't  have a problem with that, except you can't bring your hobbies in to work, okay?"
38750,josh,Except on Star Trek holidays. 
38751,josh,"Well, work hard around here. We'll make one."
38752,toby,"...not just a chance, but a mission unique in all of human... To prove that liberty is...  To prove that... Freedom unlocks... a higher fraction of the human potential... than...  than any..."
38754,toby,This is mine. 
38755,toby,Stop reading mine.
38757,toby,"Stop reading it, please. "
38758,toby,We can't offer you any money. We could put you in a hotel.
38760,toby,"Fine, but she's on your payroll. "
38761,toby,"This is incredibly good, Will. ""Never shrinking from the world's..."" ""...a fierce  belief in what we can achieve together."" I used to write like this. It was ten months  ago. I don't understand what's going on. I really don't. I've had slumps before.  Everybody does, but this is different. I'm sorry, we don't know each other, but there  aren't that many people I can talk to about it. I don't understand what's happening.  There's no blood going to it. I never had to locate it before. I don't even know where  to look. I'm the President's voice and I don't want it to sound like this. And there's  an incredible history to second inaugurals. ""Fear itself,"" Lincoln... I really thought  I was on my way to being one of those guys. I thought I was close. Now I'm just writing  for my life and you can't serve the President that way. But if I didn't write... I can't  serve him at all."
38763,toby,What's the third thing?
38765,toby,"All right. All right. Chances are you have certain qualities that are gonna annoy me.  I don't know what they are yet, but you have a certain quality about you that says that  even though you're a capitalist, you've been schooled in Eastern philosophies."
38767,toby,You didn't deny you've been schooled in Eastern philosophy.
38769,toby,Look...
38771,toby,"Good, 'cause they're never annoying."
38773,toby,"Well, I appreciate that."
38775,toby,You didn't give it to me yesterday?
38777,toby,Happy Thanksgiving.
38779,toby,Yeah.
38780,c.j.,It's really starting to get socked in out there and I'm worried about the airports.
38781,c.j.,"Well, one more after this."
38782,c.j.,You just want them to take you to their place and... 
38783,c.j.,Yes. Sing... is what I was going to say. Take you to their place and sing.
38784,c.j.,You should hear these guys...
38785,leo,"Yeah, in a minute.  Hey. You staying in town?"
38786,josh,No. She's meeting Jack Reese at the Washington Inn. How does he get a room at the Wash--  I can't get a room at the Washington Inn.  Me? I don't know yet. What do you need?
38787,leo,Isreal's closed the Church of the Nativity. You want to believe that at Christmas?
38788,josh,It's ironic.
38789,leo,Why?
38790,josh,"'Cause Mary and Joseph couldn't get a room at the inn and they went to this place,  which is now on Christmas-- the irony isn't self- explanatory?"
38791,leo,This isn't funny.
38792,josh,I know.
38793,leo,It's not funny.
38794,josh,Why did they close it?
38795,leo,I don't know. Can you find out?
38796,josh,Yeah.
38797,leo,Thank you.
38798,toby,Toby Ziegler.
38799,toby,Tobias Zachary Ziegler.
38800,toby,"December 23, 1954."
38801,toby,Yes.
38802,toby,She's my ex-wife.
38803,toby,You would have to ask her.
38804,toby,Yes.
38805,toby,No.
38806,toby,It's private.
38807,toby,But you have to demonstrate relevancy.
38808,toby,The conspiracy was massive.
38809,toby,"As I understand pregnancy, it's a binary state, you either are or you aren't."
38810,toby,"Once again, there are medical records."
38811,toby,There are two babies.
38812,toby,"I'm told that on my sunniest of days, I'm not that fun to be around. I wonder what's  going to happen when you make my children a part of your life."
38813,c.j.,The President and First Lady will board Air Force One this evening at 7:30 for their  flight to Manchester and attend midnight mass tomorrow at the Church of the Sacred Heart.  Mark... what are you doing?
38814,c.j.,You were supposed to come in here as Santa Claus.
38815,c.j.,Where was I?
38816,c.j.,You exchanged gifts?
38817,c.j.,"Well, this is exactly what happened to Ebenezer Scrooge who was a very nice little guy  until something happened with Mr. Fezziwig that I can't remember. "
38818,c.j.,"All right, back to business."
38819,c.j.,Aww... you see!
38820,c.j.,"Santa, you'll be mindful of security, right?"
38821,c.j.,"I've been bad, I've been very bad."
38822,c.j.,Aww... It's a goldfish pin! Thank you everyone. It's beautiful. Merry Christmas.  This is so sweet. Thank you. That's a full lid.
38823,c.j.,"They gave me a gold fish pin 'cause I like goldfish. Actually, what I like are the  crackers, but there was a guy... "
38824,c.j.,Danny?
38826,toby,Why do you sit in the lobby instead of my office?
38828,toby,I wasn't listening to anything you just said.
38830,toby,It's 'cause I didn't care.
38832,toby,This has become inconvenient for me.
38834,toby,Your being at OEOB and me having meetings in the lobby. I'm moving you closer.
38836,toby,The empty office next to me.
38838,toby,Why?
38840,toby,You'll move your stuff in today.
38842,toby,Yeah.
38844,toby,Okay.
38846,toby,Don't be ridiculous. It's a West Wing office. Everyone who works in the White House is  gonna resent you.
38848,toby,"Yet, curiously, I don't care."
38850,toby,"Get your stuff, and we'll talk about the notes."
38852,toby,"Zach, can you call Joan Tanner at the EPA, please?"
38853,toby,Ginger?
38854,toby,Josh got you in? You talked to Josh?
38855,toby,"Ginger, tell security to stand by at Station Six, please."
38856,bartlet,There's a new international math and science study. We rank 19 out of 21 countries.
38857,bartlet,This is what I'm talking about.
38858,bartlet,South Africa and Cyprus.
38859,bartlet,"No, you don't. Nor us anymore, for that matter. One-third of all math teachers and half  of science teachers didn't major or minor in that subject."
38860,bartlet,"And we'll want to get to the bottom of that. But we're increasing education spending to  over a $100 billion a year and, as a result, we have seventh grade textbooks being used  in ninth grade and the same answers get a higher score on S.A.T.s."
38861,bartlet,Right. But I'm talking about children now.
38862,bartlet,On the S.A.T.s?
38863,bartlet,You don't want to know.
38864,bartlet,"I got 800/790. For the life of me, I can't imagine what I got wrong. Then I took them  again, and got 800/790. I mean, is it possible there was some sort of number-two pencil  anomaly that could've...?"
38865,bartlet,"Yeah, I know, it's a little... something."
38866,bartlet,"So our schools have reached a crisis and our infant mortality rate is two and a half  times what it is in Singapore. So what I think we should do for starters is, we should  keep more people alive, then send them to school. Get a little peace and prosperity going."
38867,bartlet,"Stanley, the width and depth of what I haven't done about it yet... You know you can't  do anything about hurricanes? The President can't do anything about nature or bad luck.  I ought to be able to do something about the airplane."
38868,bartlet,"Wait, what'd I just say?"
38869,bartlet,What do airplanes signify?
38870,bartlet,Really.
38871,bartlet,"Stanley, I never thought to ask, but you are a doctor, right?"
38872,bartlet,Yeah.
38873,bartlet,I've been spacing out for a minute at meetings. Three times this week. I hear someone  talking and realize I wasn't listening to part of it.
38874,bartlet,Very. 
38875,bartlet,Hi. Yeah.  It's Leo.
38876,leo,Mr. President.
38877,bartlet,What's going on?
38878,leo,The Church of the Nativity is closed. You want to believe that?
38879,bartlet,Why?
38880,leo,"I'm finding out. Dr. Keyworth, Dulles and International are both closed."
38881,leo,You mind being our guest for a little while?
38882,bartlet,"And now we're one-third of the way through an Agatha Chrstie story.  ""Where  nobody be goin' nowhere. The bridge is washed out."" Well, I'm finished. But I was doing  the guy that says that in the Agatha Christie stories. Stanley, as always. Leo, I'll be  in the office."
38883,leo,"Thank you, sir."
38884,c.j.,The score gets that high?
38885,c.j.,When did you start liking cricket?
38886,c.j.,"Oh, I love Bermuda. I like the scooters."
38887,c.j.,What was the point?
38888,c.j.,This is like something you'd get on the Internet.
38889,josh,The Israelis say it's unsafe.
38890,leo,They're worried about an attack.
38891,josh,"They're worried about the roof caving in, part of it collasped this morning."
38892,leo,Why can't they fix it?
38893,josh,'Cause they'd have to bring in hammers and nails.
38894,leo,They're worried someone's going to use this stuff for bombs?
38895,josh,"Of course that's what they're worried about. Leo, there are like 93,000 other churches  within rock-throwing distance of this place. I'm not sure..."
38896,leo,"I don't think that's the point. I'm not trying to create a plan for a lasting cease-fire.  Right now, I'm just trying to fix a roof. Is that really not possible down there? See  if you can find a U.N. relief and recovery unit anywhere around there, or an NGO that  could serve as neutral-- God-- as a nuetral part to oversee transportation, storage  and repair. Thank you."
38897,josh,Thank you.
38898,toby,What the hell are you doing? What were you doing?
38899,josh,"Yes, I'm sorry. Yes, I did."
38900,toby,I wish you hadn't and you knew that.
38901,josh,I did.
38902,toby,Yeah.
38903,toby,Your flight's canceled. All the shuttles are canceled for a while.
38904,toby,"No, you can't. The tracks are frozen in Trenton. What hotel are you staying at?  We'll see if we can get you the room for a few hours more."
38905,toby,Ginger...
38906,toby, Would you call around to the hotels we know and see if anybody's got  a room for me?
38907,toby,Excuse me.
38908,toby,Hey.
38910,toby,Looks like some of the junior staffers may have moved their bicycles in here in protest.
38912,toby,You know...
38914,toby,I agree with all three of them.
38916,toby,"Except, if you say, at the beginning of the administration that you want campaign reform,  and nothing happens, then you just spent four years doing nothing about campaign reform."
38918,toby,I-I still think he's right but it gets a conversation. Someone will tell you what time  the meeting is.
38920,toby,The President.
38922,toby,Us.
38924,toby,"You can tell 'em I said move the bicycles, you know?"
38926,toby,Yeah.
38927,toby,We're striking out on hotels.
38928,toby,"Okay, that's a good idea. You've been convicted of multiple felonies. You think the  U.S. Secret Service lets you walk around this building unescourted?! You can't!  You're a threat to the President!"
38929,toby,I'm going to work for a while now.
38930,bartlet,Yeah?
38931,bartlet,It's not that cold.
38938,bartlet,Charlie.
38939,bartlet,I want to see Josh in his office. Let him know I'm coming.
38941,josh,"No, no, actually three units are in the Sudan and a fourth is in Turkey, which...  just had a 6.2 seismic experience. That's an earthquake, right? Okay, just make  sure they know it's just transportation and oversight. We don't need materials. "
38942,josh,"Come in. Becky, also... "
38943,josh,"Excuse me. I'll call you back. Good afternoon, Mr. President."
38944,bartlet,"Listen, this is going to sound crazy but Olympia Buckland had an infant mortality  bill that we asked her not to take out of committee 'cause it was too expensive."
38945,josh,Yeah.
38946,bartlet,I'd like her initiative or something similiar to be folded into the HHS budget.
38947,josh,"Yes, sir. We can make it a priority with the next Congress."
38948,bartlet,"No, I mean I want it for the next Congress. You understand what I'm saying?"
38949,josh,"I... Yes, I think that you're saying that before it goes to the printer on January 1st,  you want to rewrite the federal budget."
38950,bartlet,"A little bit, yeah. If we nip and tuck in different departments we can do it. It'll  take an around-the-clock kind of effort. Yes it's a holiday, but OMB works for us, right?"
38951,josh,"For the moment, yes."
38952,bartlet,You think this is crazy?
38953,josh,"No, certainly not crazier than Leo going for peace in the Middle East by the close  of business."
38954,josh,"Yes, sir. I can."
38955,bartlet,Thank you.
38956,josh,"Thank you, Mr. President."
38957,josh,I'm sorry. It's not what it looks like.
38959,josh,It's the...
38961,josh,"HHS budget, it seems very important to him and there's hard deadline."
38963,josh,I'll have you on the road as soon as I possibly can.
38965,josh,Call the policy council. Tell them we need to package an initiative on infant  mortality. I'll walk them through it.
38972,bartlet,Toby here yet?
38973,bartlet,"So, finally we meet."
38975,bartlet,Want to come in?
38977,bartlet,"Okay. Well, I sent some notes on the Congressional section."
38979,bartlet,Isn't that why you're here?
38981,bartlet,To see me.
38983,bartlet,I thought it was about the notes on the Congressional section.
38985,bartlet,Okay. Would you like to come back with Toby?
38987,bartlet,"Well, thanks for stopping by."
38993,toby,"On the Hill. You're not at the Hill. So, I'm back. How'd it go?"
38995,toby,Presidential flameout?
38997,toby,Makes you feel like you'll never know the love of a real woman.
38999,toby,Sure. What'd he say on the Congressional section? Never quite got there.
39001,toby,Yeah. That's a harsh look in the mirror. That'll be with you the next time you try  to make love to a real woman.
39003,toby,"Bonnie, would you get Mr. Bailey and myself a few minutes with the President this  evening?"
39004,toby,"And, people, there are laws against campaigning in Federal buildings. If you're going  to cover Will's office, please use plain oak tag or shaving cream, if you need to. Okay?"
39006,toby,"No, but hang on a second."
39007,toby,When was Albert Anastasia killed?
39008,toby,When was Anastasia killed?
39009,toby,October of '57.
39010,toby,Thank you.
39011,toby,7:30.
39013,toby,Yes.
39015,toby,"Listen, when you get home tonight you're going to be confronted by the instinct to  drink alone. Trust that instinct. Manage the pain. Don't try to be a hero."
39017,toby,These are all good questions.
39019,toby,Yeah.
39021,toby,Yeah.
39023,toby,"He made ladies' raincoats and before that, he worked for Murder Incorporated."
39024,toby,"Boy, it really is snowing."
39025,josh,"There problem is, there's been an earthquake in Turkey and those units are occupied.  I say there's been an earthquake. A 6.2 seismic experience. Thank you, I realize the  hour and it's a holiday but if can get back to me. Thank you. "
39027,josh,What are they talking about?
39029,josh,They want to cut early childhood nutrition? The kids will just die later.
39031,josh,What does OMB have?
39033,josh,A tax on poor people 'cause they can't afford medical care.
39035,josh,I'll get you there first thing in the morning.
39037,josh,Jack's already down there?
39039,josh,I'll call him and apologize.
39041,josh,I meant that I wasn't keeping you here on purpose.
39043,josh,I wasn't.
39045,josh,"I don't know. It was just something I said. Listen, it doesn't have to be a disaster,  you know. C.J.'s staff is going to make little snowmen and stick them on the seats in  the Press Briefing Room and take a picture. We can do that and then I'll get you drunk  at the Hawk and Dove."
39047,josh,I have to go see the President.
39048,c.j.,How's it going?
39049,josh,Leo and the President have gone Chrsimas crazier than usual.
39050,c.j.,You know Danny's back.
39051,josh,"Yeah, I got an e-mail from him. Any sparks?"
39052,c.j.,Come here for a second.
39053,c.j.,"He's chasing a story that says the day Shareef's plane went down, there was an airstrip  in Bermuda that was secured by Rangers."
39054,josh,You told Leo?
39055,c.j.,I told him. I didn't ask him any questions.
39056,josh,"Danny thinks w-we somehow got a Gulfstream to land in Bermuda, assassinated Sharef,  then disassembled the plane and distributed the pieces throughout the Bermuda Triangle?"
39057,c.j.,Yeah.
39058,josh,I think he spent too much time in the Africa hot.
39059,c.j.,The thing is...
39060,josh,Yeah?
39061,c.j.,I'm absolutely certain that's what happened.
39062,josh,We're not supposed to talk about his.
39063,c.j.,"If it is true, we need to say so before Danny does. We've been here before."
39064,josh,"Not here, but I get your point."
39065,c.j.,Okay.
39066,bartlet,He's the best-looking person I've ever seen in real life.
39067,bartlet,"Oh, would you?"
39068,bartlet,"Yeah, that was a setback for the Bourbons. Listen..."
39069,bartlet,"Zoey, I think it's really sweet that you still come to me for permission. You're classy,  and you're old-fashioned."
39070,bartlet,Not in a million years.
39071,bartlet,Listen. Sit down for a second.
39072,bartlet,"When you were little, like two, I really wanted you to like me and I wan't sure you did.  With Liz and Ellie, my act just worked and with you I had to try harder. "
39073,bartlet,I did something a few months ago and I'm sure I was right and I'd do it again but it's  hard to live with. This is ridiculous. You're freezing. Come inside.
39074,bartlet,Come inside.
39075,leo,"Good evening, Mr. President. Zoey."
39076,bartlet,"You know, why don't you go back to the Residence and make sure your mom hasn't killed  your boyfriend. Yeah, he can come to Manchester. He's going to have more Secret Service  stuff to do, and he's going to have to sleep in the root cellar which, like your bedroom  door, will be guarded round the clock by two U.S. Marshals."
39077,leo,She looks great.
39078,bartlet,I almost told her. I've been feeling it a little lately. I've been exorcising my guilt  by having Josh crowbar infant mortality money into the HHS budget on December 23 at 8:00.
39079,leo,"For me, he's trying to get Arabs and Israelis to like each other."
39080,bartlet,How's it going?
39081,leo,It's a challenge.
39082,bartlet,Yeah.
39083,leo,Danny Concannon knows a guy who couldn't get to his locker.
39084,bartlet,Yeah. We'll figure it out.
39085,leo,Yeah.
39086,bartlet,"Stanley thought it was weird that I took the SAT's again, too."
39087,leo,It is.
39088,bartlet,You don't think it's possible that the remaining answer was important?
39089,leo,No.
39090,bartlet,Really?
39091,leo,Yeah.
39092,bartlet,How the hell would you know? You got 1400.
39093,leo,True.
39094,bartlet,"Yeah, send them in."
39095,toby,"Good evening, Mr. President."
39096,bartlet,"Yeah. Listen, my reasons for not wanting to talk about campaign reform at the  Inauguration are simple. It's not a legislative speech and when we cite issues,  it should be the ones that affect people's lives. You agree?"
39097,toby,Yes.
39098,bartlet,Anything else?
39099,toby,"No, sir. In his defense, he caught the bad note. He came to me. He made it important."
39100,leo,Yeah.
39101,toby,He wasn't distracted bt the fact that his office was filled with bicycles.
39103,toby,Yeah.
39105,toby,"Yeah, that was planted there to see how well you'd do telling truth to power."
39106,bartlet,Not very well so far.
39108,bartlet,"Okay, except when I asked you to come into the Oval Office you said, ""No, no, no.  No, no, no, no."""
39110,bartlet,And you called me Mr. Justice.
39111,leo,Can we get back to why you think...?
39113,leo,"Maybe, but I'm not convinced and that's 'caused you haven't convinced me. This isn't  Tillman at the Stanford Club or the California 47th. This is big-boy school, Mr. Bailey.  You understand?"
39115,leo,All right. It's Christmas. You've probably got someplace to go.
39116,toby,"Thank you, Mr. President."
39117,josh,I just need to tell you this. Come here. 
39118,josh,Sorry. come here.
39119,toby,Josh...
39120,josh,Come here.
39121,josh,"All right, it was desperation. It wasn't out of a desire to do evil. He had a young  family and he barely spoke the language. He went to jail. He went to jail and you went  to school, and it was all a half century ago. Look what he did in two generations.  What room did you just walk out of?"
39122,toby,I appreciate that that's what you think. Do I get to think what I think?
39123,josh,"No, you don't, 'cause you don't know what I know."
39124,toby,What?
39125,josh,"That I would give anything to have a father who was a felon, or a sister with a past.  That's it."
39126,leo,Josh! I was just coming to see you. You're off the hook with both of us. We'll go for  infant mortality after the first.
39127,josh,I don't mind. People are working on it. I have Donna here with me. We've got a whole  night planned around it.
39128,leo,"Yeah, I'm calling it off, and I hooked Donna up with a news helicopter that's landing  about two miles from the inn she's going to. "
39129,josh,Donna left?
39130,leo,"Yeah. Oh, forget the Nativity. We'll get 'em next time."
39131,josh,"Yes, sir."
39132,toby,"Oh, my God. I know when Anastasia was killed. I know about that candy store in  Brownsville. I know about Louie Amberg. I know about the Half Moon Hotel sixth story  window, Coney Island!"
39133,toby,"Pa, please."
39134,toby,We don't have to do this all in one night.
39135,toby,It's getting late. Stay on my couch. You're getting out in the morning.
39136,toby,You should stay tonight with me.
39137,toby,Very healthy.
39138,toby,"No, not yet."
39139,toby,The Whiffenpoofs. It's a group called the Wiffenpoofs. They're from Yale. They came  to do a series of concerts and the snow...
39140,toby,Whiffenpoofs. I'm surprised you haven't heard of them. You used to like Cole Porter  a lot.
39141,toby,"Yeah, right there."
39142,toby,What?
39143,leo,Josh. Was I insensitive before about telling you Donna was gone?
39144,josh,No. What do you mean?
39145,leo,I don't know. I thought...
39146,josh,"It's fine. Of course it's fine. It's great. I was feeling guilty, but now, this...  is good. This, this... is better than good. It's the way it should be."
39147,leo,"Oh, get it together, would you please? "
39148,josh,I'm trying.
39149,leo,Okay. There's something we have to talk about.
39150,josh,You'll tell me when you need to.
39151,leo,It's four years later and there are things that are worse and things that are exactly  the same. Where do you start?
39152,josh,By fixing a roof. I'm staying on the phones. You want to stay with me?
39153,leo,Yeah.
39154,josh,"Three years I've worked in the Senate, four years in the White House, this is my  first time in the Republican cloakroom."
39155,josh,You guys use the same decorator as we do.
39156,josh,"Hey, was Benjamin Harrison banned from here?"
39157,josh,Prompting another resolution?
39158,josh,Is there any chance that Nearing is soft? Is there anything that makes her vote yea?
39159,josh,You sure?
39160,josh,What about Herman Morton?
39161,josh,"It's 50-50, Jane. Hoynes has a sleeping bag in there. We need to, you and I..."
39162,josh,Which Senator?
39163,josh,What the hell...?
39164,josh,"Wait, wait, wait a second..."
39165,josh,A poll!?
39166,josh,What the hell do I care? These people are responding to...
39167,josh,Now you're for more education funding?
39168,josh,Of course foreign aid polls badly. The people it's helping aren't the ones answering  the phone.
39169,josh,The Senator just reached this conclusion when the Libery Foundation--
39170,josh,"When you say the New York Times people, you're not talking about the people the who  work there, are you?"
39171,josh,"You mean ""people who can read?"""
39172,josh,I understand what it is.
39173,josh,I think this is crap. I think your boss has known about this poll for awhile and he's  embarassing the President at the eleventh hour because he spent too much time with his  arm around the other guy.
39174,josh,On the first vote out of the box.
39175,josh,President Bartlet.
39176,bartlet,It's the curse of every daughter's father.
39177,bartlet,I don't like them. I don't like them at all.
39178,bartlet,What the hell happened with you two? It was perfect. I just kept you in the office  all the time.
39179,bartlet,"That was the point. If I was trying to make her happy, I'd buy her a Cabriolet."
39180,c.j.,Sir?
39181,bartlet,C-Jean. Stable economies with free-flowing uranium don't make for a stable world  community. Did I make that point?
39182,c.j.,Absolutely.
39183,bartlet,Good. And is there a cow on my schedule today?
39184,c.j.,It's called Heifer International. Don't worry about it.
39185,bartlet, I'm meeting with a cow. I shouldn't worry about it.
39186,c.j.,"It's a photo-op with a cow, sir. It's not a sit-down."
39187,bartlet,I like your sass.
39188,c.j.,"You got a very nice sass, yourself... sir."
39189,bartlet,"What, are you touring?"
39190,c.j.,I could.
39191,bartlet, Am I right on time?
39192,bartlet,How you doing? Good to see you. Great. Thank you. Thanks for coming. Thank you.  Thank you. Thank you very much. 
39193,bartlet,Thank you. Thank you. Good to see you. How are you? How are you?
39194,c.j.,Yeah.
39195,josh,We're a vote down.
39196,c.j.,What happened?
39197,josh,Colorado happened.
39198,c.j.,Charlie.
39199,bartlet,  How are you today?
39200,c.j.," Okay, we're coming back."
39202,josh,68% think we spend too much on foreign aid. 59% think it should be cut.
39204,josh,Respondants estimate foreign aid to be 15% of the federal budget. It's one percent  of the federal budget. Or it was a half hour ago.
39206,josh,Come here. I lose this vote... I'm resigning.
39207,josh,They won't do it. Not after two continuing resolutions. This expires at midnight.
39208,josh,"It massively is, yes."
39209,leo,What about Grace Hardin?
39210,josh,"Yeah, I though of her. Can she say no to the President?"
39211,josh,"I say she's a Democrat, she owes the President, and there is nothing wrong with  Georgia New England can't fix."
39212,leo,"If it's no, it's got to be a fast no."
39213,josh,It's not going to be no. Put the senior senator from Colorado in the nay column.  Move Grace Hardin to undecided and start the clock.
39214,josh,I hate that clock.
39216,josh,"Yeah, you're Bill Bailey, right?"
39218,josh,I'm surprised we haven't met.
39220,josh,We talked on the phone.
39222,josh,I've heard the jokes. What do you need?
39224,josh,"Bill, I know who you are. What do you need?"
39226,josh,"Boy, did you pick the wrong day to write about bipartisan cooperation."
39228,josh,"68% of respondants think we hand out too much in foreign aid, 59% think it should  be cut."
39230,josh,Read me what you got so far.
39232,josh,"Strike ""in their enduring wisdom."" You think electing a reactionary Congress and a  progressive President was wise? The people, in a fog of uncertainty, unsure of the  difference, split tickets across the country. "
39234,josh,"68% say we hand out too much, 59% want to see it cut."
39239,josh,I need Senator Hardin.
39241,josh,Good.
39243,josh,I'm going to try everybody. But Cantina's never voted to send any money anywhere.  I think he's against airmail stamps.
39245,josh,He needs Republican votes on broadband access.
39247,josh,She's a freshman Democrat. She can't say no to the President if he asks her.
39249,josh,"There's a hockey coach who's got a player who's squandering his potential. Coach  says, ""Are you ignorant or just apathetic?"" Player says, ""I don't know and I don't  care."" Yeah, I've seen how foreign aid polls in Georgia. Gracie might be a little  tough to get to the phone today."
39251,josh,Tell me about it.
39253,josh,My job is to execute the plays Leo calls. The rest doesn't matter.
39255,josh,Are we looking for Hardin?!
39257,c.j.,"Like I said before, the continuing resolution expires at midnight. If Congress  doesn't act, there is no foreign aid budget."
39258,c.j.,"The President wishes the Republican Leader would throw some money at problems  right here, but doesn't wish to help the United States retreat from its role as  a world leader. Foreign aid's been cut 50% in the last decade. In percentage of  GNP spent, we rank not toward the bottom; we are the bottom, dead last. Mark."
39259,c.j.,"The President doesn't beleive that for something this important, something like  that should be taken into consideration. Steve?"
39260,c.j.,We're not responding to a blind quote; we're just assuming you made it up. 
39261,c.j.,I'm not kidding. Thank you.
39262,c.j.,Danny... come back to the office for a second?
39263,c.j.,"He said, ""Lord God, what a tool""."
39264,c.j.,I'm a senior adminstration official. You can say several senior administration  officials say the White House will have a good memory when the transportation bill  comes up next year.
39265,c.j.,No.
39266,c.j.,Yes?
39267,c.j.,Yes?
39268,c.j.,Danny...
39269,c.j.,What do you think it is I'm going to say?
39270,c.j.,Was that it?
39271,c.j.,"And sooner or later, you'll find him."
39272,c.j.,"You know, I got to tell you, your tie goes with your shirt, and your jacket... you're  dating a college graduate, aren't you?"
39273,c.j.,"Yeah, I just meant it was a nice tie."
39274,c.j.,Okay. 
39275,c.j.,"What's up there, Gail."
39280,josh," An hour and half, we can't find a U.S. Senator."
39282,josh,No kidding.
39284,josh,"Donna, your job is to take this, find her and stick it in her hand. Make big plays today."
39285,bartlet,We live in an interdependent world and we should act like it. We live in a global  community and we should sustain it. We should cross borders. We should cross borders  to build sustainable democracies that can banish privation and fear. And we should  cross borders to bring food and medicine and roads and schools and teachers to parts  of the world forgotten by all but the warlords. We're gonna pass this Foreign Ops  bill. This should be a century of hope and prosperity everywhere. And America is  going to lead the world and not just bully it. Thank you.
39286,bartlet, What the hell is going on?
39287,bartlet, What the hell is going on?
39288,leo,Hardin's a yes if we can get her on the phone.
39289,bartlet,Which is why we can't get her on the phone?
39290,leo,"She's been a little slippery, but this is where Josh eats."
39291,bartlet,"We have many, many backup plans in the works? Josh has broken people into teams and  they're developing and executing rapid-response backup plans?"
39292,leo,"Yeah, okay. "
39293,leo,Toby... we should probably have a backup plan.
39294,bartlet,"Oh, my God."
39295,leo,"A split second of humor injected in the middle of a stressful day, sir. Sounds to me  like we're talking about the act of a friend."
39296,bartlet,"Please, my daughter's dating a kid who's better-looking than my wife. I have only so  much RAM to give over to-- C.J.!"
39297,c.j.,"Yes, sir."
39298,bartlet,"I'm sorry, but once again, there's a cow?"
39299,c.j.,A photo-op with a cow.
39300,bartlet,"Yeah, I got that part. It was..."
39301,c.j.,"Heifer Internatinal, it's called. They give milking cows to poor families in developing  nations."
39302,bartlet,And that's great. But a picture of me and a cow...
39303,c.j.,"I have my concerns, sir."
39304,bartlet,Why did you agree to it in the first place?
39305,c.j.,"Well, it's an organization worthy of..."
39306,bartlet,Abbey set it up?
39307,c.j.,"I'll figure out a way to make the picture work, sir."
39308,bartlet,"Well, good luck with that. Now turn around casually and tell me if Le Vicomte de  Valvert has got his hands anywhere near anyone who's related to me."
39309,c.j.,That is a good-looking young man.
39310,bartlet, Zoey!
39311,bartlet,"Yeah, I think you'd respond if I stopped feeding you!"
39312,toby,Free food and the gentle lady from Tennessee.
39313,toby,I don't think he was talking about the last half-century. Neither do you.
39314,toby,"Hey, food is apolitical."
39315,toby,"Jimmy, you want to tell me something I don't know?"
39316,toby,Whose?
39317,toby,Can you be there in half an hour?
39318,toby,Okay.
39320,josh,"We're at the airport, we're at Dirksen, we're at her house, we're at her gym, we're  at her Senate office, we're at her second office, we're at her lawyer's office,  we're at her husband's office."
39322,josh,The legislative section.
39324,josh,"You say that like constitutional scholars made a conscious choice, weighing checks  and balances."
39326,josh,Are any of those people in this room?
39328,josh,"One wants to save Social Security, the other wants to privatize it. One wants to make  polluters pay to clean up pollution, the other wants to give tax breaks so they can  pollute more. One wants to send aid to countries... "
39330,josh,Yeah.
39332,josh,No kidding. 
39333,josh,Toby.
39334,toby,Yeah.
39335,josh,Hoebuck?
39336,toby,He came to me.
39337,josh,"He authored a bill to insert the word ""God"" into the Pledge of Allegiance four  more times."
39338,toby,"Yeah, well, once you've broken that dam, what the hell does it matter?"
39339,toby,Yeah.
39340,toby,Million.
39341,toby,"You said you wanted 115,000. You meant million."
39342,toby,For what?
39343,toby,Out of the federal budget?
39344,toby,And this woman leads a world-class team of psychiatrist?
39345,toby,This is where you draw up a list of sinners...
39346,toby,"Yeah, C.J. got spammed with that a few months ago."
39347,toby,You really want to make a rim shot out of a Secret Service Agent getting dead?
39348,toby,"Dr. Chen, what are you doing here?"
39349,toby,This isn't happening.
39350,toby,Huh.
39351,toby,Any of them published in the New England Journal of Medicine?
39352,toby,Jimmy...
39366,c.j.,"Well, first of all, that's not a cow. It's not! It's a goat. Yeah, I may have agreed  to something about a goat."
39367,leo,Did the First Lady get you drunk and take you shopping?
39368,c.j.,Leo... yes. The name of the group is Heifer International. I-I... I was under the  impression it was going to be a cow.
39369,leo,Lending Presidential aura to the photo?
39370,c.j.,"Okay. I think what were going to do is, I think we're going to wait until after the  vote at 10:30, 'cause if we don't win, then it would be a mistake for this picture  to run tomorrow."
39371,leo,How big a mistake?
39372,c.j.,One from which my job certainly would have hung in the balance.
39373,leo,In the balance?
39374,c.j.," Goats are heifers, too?"
39375,leo,"If the President's wearing a hat, or that thing's wearing a Bartlet button, I'm  hiding snakes in your car."
39376,c.j.,"Come on, don't say that! Not even to joke!"
39377,leo,You're never gonna know where they are...
39378,c.j.,Leo!
39379,leo,...or if you got them all out.  Excuse me. Gonna lay their eggs right in  the glove compartment. 
39380,c.j.," So, this is going to be a while. Can you wait?"
39381,c.j.,Are you Ron?
39382,c.j.,Of course. We'll find an empty room for him.
39383,c.j.,"Well, you should bring the oats, because the Mess closes at six."
39408,toby,Hey... What's going on?
39409,josh,"Well, Donna tried to flush her out and she did it well, but..."
39410,toby,What?
39411,josh,She named names.
39412,toby,Ah...
39414,toby,"Well, you were right, Hoebuck's crazy."
39415,josh,What did he want?
39416,toby,"$115,000."
39417,josh,Million.
39418,toby,"No, thousand."
39419,josh,For what?
39420,toby,It doesn't matter.
39421,josh,For what?
39422,toby,An NIH study on remote prayer.
39423,josh,You're kidding.
39424,toby,"Actually, he brought a Duke cardiologist who ran a double-blind...."
39425,josh,"$115,000, he votes yes on Foreign Ops?"
39426,toby,"Josh, it's the federal governmemt investing..."
39427,josh,I don't care if we're investing in communion wafers.
39428,toby,"Josh, it's the federal governent."
39429,josh,We'll deal with the other thing tomorrow.
39430,toby,"Well, I already dealt with it today."
39431,josh,"Not yet, and the clock's running. I'm going to Leo."
39432,bartlet,"There are a couple of thousand miltary families on food stamps. I can't stand it;  the Pentagon knows it. Some families are eligible, some aren't. To change it, they'd  have to raise everyone's pay, which they can't do, and this memo's a reminder. It's a  get-off-our-backs memo. And you thought you were done with turf wars."
39433,bartlet,You decommissioned two aircraft carriers.
39434,bartlet,No.
39435,bartlet,"Boy, Zoey's growing up nicely, isn't she?"
39436,bartlet,"I'm on your side in this thing, but just barely. Just by a little bit, because  he's French and royal. These are very special, very limited circumstances under  which we're allies, you and I."
39437,bartlet,You still got it?
39438,bartlet,The letter from the rope line.
39439,bartlet,Put it in my bag tonight.
39440,leo,Mr. President.
39441,bartlet,"Mr. McGarry, Mr. Ziegler, Mr. Lyman, Ms. Cregg. It's the Tepmtations. I love you guys."
39442,leo,"You only think you've heard everything, but you haven't."
39443,bartlet,Hit me.
39444,leo,Toby.
39445,toby,"James Hoebuck will vote yea 10:30 if we give him $115,000."
39446,bartlet,Million?
39447,josh,"Thousand. $115,000."
39448,bartlet,For an RV? What's he want?
39449,leo,An NIH study on remote prayer.
39450,bartlet,I like it. There should a button on my desk I can press and 49 people instantly  pray for me.
39451,c.j.,I got remote prayed for by three million people.
39452,bartlet,How'd it work out?
39453,c.j.,Good for me. Can't vouch much for what it was they were praying was going to happen.
39454,bartlet,"Well, that's the problem."
39455,josh,Excuse me.
39456,bartlet,Yes.
39457,josh,The Earth is rotating rapidly on its axis.
39458,bartlet,"Okay, well, good news. Keep us posted on that."
39459,josh,"We're moving into 8:00 now, sir."
39460,bartlet,Is there something I should be doing I'm not doing?
39461,josh,We should be talking about Jimmy Hoebuck.
39462,bartlet,"Oh, wait. You guys didn't come in here to tell me something funny?"
39463,toby,Three of us did.
39464,bartlet," You... you, are the wildcard, my friend, because you..."
39465,josh,Sir...
39466,bartlet,"...because you will throw out the baby, the bathwater, and the bubbles at curtain  time if it means..."
39467,josh,"Excuse me, sir..."
39468,bartlet,Feel free to interrupt.
39469,josh,"Do you think, Mr. President, the people who get this money care about an NIH study?"
39470,bartlet,"I don't care if they care! I care! And oh, by the way, so do you!"
39471,josh,"$115,000 is what Commerce spends on Post-Its."
39472,bartlet,Toby?
39473,toby,Threats to civil liberties only ever come a few dollars at a time.
39474,josh,"It's a medical study. The Nuclear Test Ban Treaty doesn't prohibit radiation therapy.  Sufi Muslims, Orthodox Jews, Indian shamans-- the study says it works with everybody,  so it's not promoting Christianity."
39475,bartlet,"Well, in my faith, we've known it's worked for two thousand years. I never knew there  was data available, but okay."
39476,leo,"Anything else, sir?"
39477,bartlet,No.
39478,josh,"Thank you, sir."
39479,bartlet,Maxine.
39480,c.j., That's you.
39481,josh,I know.
39482,josh,I apologize for interrupting before.
39483,bartlet,"Oh, I don't care. But what I was going to say..."
39484,josh," I'll toss it all overboard if it means winning, and I think that's  not true, and I'd ask you to support that with evidence... I'm sorry. I don't know  why I keep doing that."
39485,bartlet,You're not willing to toss it overboard to win. You're willing to toss it overboard  to avoid disappointing Leo. You know what the difference is between you and me?  I want to be the guy. You want to be the guy the guy counts on.
39486,josh,We lost.
39487,bartlet,We know.
39488,josh,We can introduce another continuing resolution... 90 days?
39489,bartlet,And work down?
39490,josh,75% of current funding maybe.
39491,bartlet,If we can get it.
39492,josh,"You understand if we introduce another continuing resolution, about ten Democrats  will jump on as a reason to vote no on this. Means losing 60-40 instead of 51-49."
39493,bartlet,"When I lose, I don't look for consolation in the score and I know for sure you don't.  So, it's what we should do, right?"
39494,josh,Yeah.
39495,bartlet,"All right, tough beat. It's an unbelievably tough beat."
39496,josh,"Yes, sir."
39497,bartlet,"Hey, Zoey's growing up very nicely, isn't she?"
39498,josh,"Man, I'll say. "
39499,josh,"You know, I go for kiss-ass today and the ball goes in the gutter."
39500,bartlet,Anything else?
39501,josh,"Thank you, Mr. President."
39503,josh,I don't think it mattered. She knows how to count to 51.
39505,josh,Shake it off. And don't listen to the naysayer. You've got a big future as a stalker.
39507,josh,"I just had an interesting moment. I just recommended to the President that he buy a  yea vote for a $115,000 and the Bill of Rights."
39509,josh,"Jimmy Hoebuck wanted to fund a study on remote prayer for $115,000."
39511,josh,"It's getting harder. I'd say we're going to make more enemies in the second term,  but I don't know if there's anybody left on the list."
39513,josh,I did it with gusto.
39515,josh,Is this a real person or a Donna person?
39517,josh,"Not that there needs to be, but... was there a point?"
39519,josh,"Yeah... You're going to need some Kryptonite, by the way."
39521,josh,All right.
39523,josh,And we'll steal the rest?
39525,josh,All right. Good work tonight.
39527,josh,"What's up, Mr. Daley?"
39529,josh,Bill Bailey?
39531,josh,"So, if we're lucky, foreign aid's going to be funded for another 90 days at 75 cents  on the dollar. No one who's ever said they wanted bipartisanship has ever meant it.  But the people are speaking. Because 68% think we give too much in foreign aid, and  59% think it should be cut."
39533,josh,I do.
39535,josh,"Because 9% think it's too high, and shouldn't be cut! 9% of respondents could not fully  get their arms around the question. There should be another box you can check for, ""I  have utterly no idea what you're talking about. Please, God, don't ask for my input."""
39537,josh,It fosters democracy.
39539,josh," Well, well played, young man. Very good, yes, yes."
39541,josh,"Someone said, ""The best argument against democracy is five minutes with the average  voter."""
39543,josh,See.
39545,josh,"I know the end of the quote. I'll work with you on the legislative section. But  after the vote, okay? We'll get some food."
39548,c.j.,Yes?
39551,c.j.,Who are you?
39553,c.j.,C.J. Cregg.
39555,c.j.,I didn't put the goat in your office. Someone else must have.
39557,c.j.,"I put it in the office that's being used by a new guy Toby and Josh are trying to  give a hard time to-- Oh, wait..."
39559,c.j.,How's that going?
39561,c.j.,The goat has a handler. I'll get it out...
39563,c.j.,Which one?
39565,c.j.,Mike.
39567,c.j.,Ron.
39573,c.j.,Yes.
39574,c.j.,Yes!
39575,c.j.,Yes!
39576,c.j.,I give them to the homeless.
39577,c.j.,Are you talking through the whole vote?
39578,c.j.,Danny...
39579,c.j.,Could you even have this much sensitivity? 
39580,c.j.,Why?
39581,c.j.,The Senate blew it.
39582,c.j.,We did everything but pass a hat!
39583,c.j.,"You know something there, General Cho? If you had a story, you'd write it. If you don't  have one, shut up. "
39584,c.j.,"We just lost a vote. We're not bumfuzzled. Now if you'll excuse me, I have to cancel a  photo op with a goat."
39585,bartlet,"Tough beat, everybody. Thanks for the work. Next time, we let Josh do it the way he wants."
39586,josh,"Sir, have you met..."
39587,bartlet,Bill Haley?
39589,bartlet,Okay.
39590,c.j.,"Good evening, Mr. President."
39591,bartlet,When's this thing with the cow?
39592,c.j.,It's a goat now.
39593,bartlet,Okay.
39594,c.j.,We'll cancel it.
39595,bartlet,You think?
39596,c.j.,A milking goat? It's going to seem like a parody of foreign aid.
39597,bartlet,I don't know. I don't know everybody. C.J. wants to cancel the goat picture. Half the  world's people live on less than two dollars a day. 130 million will never step inside  a schoolhouse. Ingredients for bombs can be purchased at hardware stores and we've just  given the Third World what the doctor ordered: rollbacks. Heifer International... they  give free cows and goats to people who need milk?
39598,c.j.,"Yes, sir."
39599,bartlet,"Well, then, I don't think that we're in any position to be snotty. Let's do it...  Let's do it right now."
39600,c.j.,Carol?
39601,c.j.,"So, I think this will work. I think it says, ""Well, you're impoverished and while we  don't care, we don't want you to go away empty-handed, so we offer you this goat, Ron,  to give you milk."""
39603,c.j.,"No, no, of course they don't. So, we offer you this thing that'll just gnaw on your stuff."
39604,bartlet,"I'm not standing in this picture alone. This was a total team failure. Stand where you  want, but I want my Chief of Staff and my Chief Political Advisor standing near the goat."
39605,toby,Hang on a second.
39606,toby,May I? 
39607,toby,Thank you.
39608,toby,Now we're ready.
39609,bartlet,Let's go.  Set that clock for 90 days.
39610,c.j.,"And after the meeting with the council on Foriegn Relations, the President and  the First Lady will be on their way to Camp David for the weekend, where the  Governor of Nebraska will join them."
39611,c.j.,"You have me, just me."
39612,c.j.,Yep. If that's all...
39613,c.j.,How did you know that?
39614,c.j.,Right.
39615,c.j.,"I'm not really sure, but like pornography, I know it when I see it. They came up with  the title and because it's high school, I felt it was an assignment and I couldn't say  no. Unfortunately, my job prevents me from certain pleasures and I'm not chickening out."
39616,c.j.,No fresh meat for the lions. 
39617,c.j.,That's a full lid.
39618,josh,"Thank you. I couldn't go out there. Like they had this sadistic, anticipatory glee."
39619,c.j.,I agree. I have to stay.
39620,toby,What are you still doing here?
39621,c.j.,"Josh can't do the briefings. Anyway, I missed the last flight to Dayton, so it's moot."
39622,toby,Go. I'll do the briefings.
39623,josh,Good luck.
39624,c.j.,"You can't. It's not your schtick. You don't know who to call on, where to look, when  to smile and interrupt..."
39625,toby,Are you scared of that promise thing?
39626,c.j.,Yes.
39627,toby,"No, that can't be it. It's your dad. I, sorry. I... uh... How's he doing?"
39628,c.j.,"You're not allowed to use the words ""Alzheimer's"" or ""doctors""."
39629,toby,"Nevertheless, those are the relevant words."
39630,c.j.,"His wife scares me. The woman who takes care of him scares me. Molly, she was my  English teacher. Believe me, she was a very tough grader."
39631,toby,You're scared of your high school English teacher.
39632,c.j.,"Well, she's also now my stepmother, so it's just a little bit fraught."
39633,toby,"Did you ever not get an ""A"" in her class? Nevertheless, Dayton awaits. "
39634,toby,Psst. Finish your speech.
39635,c.j.,"Toby, a couple of things, very important. There's a draft of some notes for a speech  on the National Endowment for the Arts and the President is going to ask for something  maybe over the weekend, and also, Toby, the secion on embassy security... "
39636,c.j.," No, not you. "
39637,c.j.,"No, I didn't mean that you had no social skills Toby. I'm sorry if you think I was  being insensitive to your... I-I think your very... you're a very pretty girl, Toby.  Oh, um, by the way, I have... I have notes about the SEC appointment speech. "
39638,c.j.,I can't do this. I'll call you later. I'm going to have a heart attack.
39639,c.j.,"Toby, if you get this, there's also a errant draft of a briefing paper on the  agricultural training exchange with the South African students and it has to pass  through the... Um, I think I have been maybe cut off. I'll e-mail you."
39640,c.j.,Pardon me?
39641,c.j.,I'm hearing Violent Femmes and thinking Quaaludes and detentions and... tacos?
39642,c.j.,Marco. Marco Arlens. 
39643,c.j.,Where's your band?
39644,c.j.,Nor did your purple-and-magenta mohawk.
39645,c.j.,Are you dreading this?
39646,c.j.,"""Promise of a Generation."" So what are you up to now?"
39647,c.j.,Paris? You were a baseball-playing punk rocker.
39648,c.j.,Thank you. I think that might've been a compliment.
39649,c.j.,"Oh, no. He has a new job now. He gets married. After my mom died-- twice, now to a  lovely lady in the English Department. Her job is baking and hating me. Did you ever  have Ms. Lapham?"
39650,c.j.,Welcome home.
39651,c.j.,Safety in numbers. That'd be great.
39652,c.j.,"I'm sorry. I, uh..."
39653,c.j.,Great.
39654,c.j.,"How are you, daddy?"
39655,c.j.,It's February.
39656,c.j.,You want to go fishing tomorrow?
39657,c.j.,Yes.
39658,c.j.,Once or twice.
39659,c.j.,I actually don't recall lovi... 
39660,c.j.,"Yes, just like."
39661,c.j.,Are we going to wake up Molly?
39662,c.j.,How is Molly?
39663,c.j.,I'll be right there. I'm just going to put my bags down and wash my face.
39664,c.j.,About Mr. Moyers. You think he... dad?
39665,c.j.,Mr. Moyers lived in Shaker Heights. The Astro's in Cleveland.
39666,c.j.,"Um, why is this kitchen such a mess?"
39667,c.j.,"Daddy, um, what do you...?"
39668,c.j.,Um... an Italian... custard sauce.
39669,c.j.,Here?
39670,c.j.,We're happy. This is the time we...
39671,c.j.,We get to.... we have a-a window. We get to.. we get to do... actual work for awhile. 
39672,c.j.,No more campaigning. Got it. 
39673,c.j.,"You already... Dad... He wanted to, uh... win. He did so with honor. We played clean."
39674,c.j.,Thank you. You're writing?
39675,c.j.,"That's wonderful, Daddy."
39676,c.j.,Not at all. I'd be happy to.
39677,c.j.,Numerical Idiocy. Cathy title.
39678,c.j.,"Daddy, 120."
39679,c.j.,I think you have to keep whipping.
39680,c.j.,"Yeah, you have to..."
39681,c.j.,Dad... maybe you need more help.
39682,c.j.,"Yes, but I don't think you're doing as well as..."
39683,c.j.,Daddy?
39684,c.j.,Where's Molly?
39685,c.j.,She left? What does that mean?
39686,c.j.,But this is what's happening. You don't just walk away. This is what's happening to you.
39687,toby,"Yeah, so everything's going well here."
39688,c.j.,Is it? Good.
39689,toby,"I, uh, where's the, uh...? I lost the, uh, uh, that NEA thing you wanted."
39690,c.j.,Lost it? It's notes. There's a file?
39691,toby,"Yeah, you needed me to polish a draft?"
39692,c.j.,"Well, there's no draft to polish. That's what I'm saying. There's notes. I don't  have them here."
39693,toby,I'm sure I can find it.
39694,c.j.,"I want to be clear about the briefing, Toby. What I meant when I said that you need  to know who to look at and when to ask certain questions is avoid the calm ones. Get  the anxious ones out of the way first, sweetie, to give the pros room to figure out  what it is they really want. And avoid the ones who don't blink. They're power devils."
39695,toby,I don't know what that is.
39696,c.j.,Yes you do. Is anything happening?
39697,toby,"The usual chaos, but minus ten percent. How are things?"
39698,c.j.,Usual. Uneventful. Daytonesque.
39699,toby,How's you father?
39700,c.j.,Fine.
39701,toby,And the wicked stepmother?
39702,c.j.,Even finer.
39703,toby,The weather?
39704,c.j.,Perfection.
39705,toby,I'll call you later.
39706,c.j.,"Hi, Lib."
39707,c.j.,"Yep, 'fraid so."
39708,c.j.,That would be today.
39709,c.j.,"""The Promise of a Generation""? Really?"
39710,c.j.,You going?
39711,c.j.,"I prefer to think of your mother as my dad's third wife, Libby."
39712,c.j.,Molly...
39713,c.j.,What happened?
39714,c.j.,"Yes, but..."
39715,c.j.,"Why didn't you call me, Molly?"
39716,c.j.,"Shut up! Shut up. You were a wonderful teacher, Molly. You should be ashamed of yourself."
39717,c.j.,"Well, not in your case, though, is it? In your case, more accurately it's the short  ""see you later goodbye"" isn't it?"
39718,c.j.,"What happened to reciprocity? Do you ever imagine in a million years if the roles  were reversed he would ever do this to you? This is-- what you're doing right now--  invalidates everything that came before all the good, the years of teaching. This  cancels a good and valuable life. He needs you."
39719,c.j.,"No, no."
39720,c.j.,"Dad, you know we need to get some help if Molly won't come back. We do."
39721,c.j.,We would figure something out.
39722,c.j.,"Well, we have to find some way because you being alone won't work out now."
39723,c.j.,The teachers were sexiest men?
39724,c.j.,Thank you. You could hurt yourself.
39725,c.j.,You will hurt yourself. We can afford it. I can afford it.
39726,c.j.,"Have you... done... have you done anything, seen doctors?"
39727,c.j.,"We could arrange to see someone. Lee Voight, he's your friend. He's a terrific  neurologist."
39728,c.j.,"Dad, I'm not..."
39729,c.j.,"Dad, I'm not Molly."
39730,c.j.,Dad... you... cannot expect me to silently do nothing. You're going to require care.
39731,c.j.,Reunion. I'm not going.
39732,c.j.,I'll quit and take care of you.
39733,c.j.,"Stop it, both of you. I'm very upset and I don't want to laugh."
39734,c.j.,There are new drugs.
39735,c.j.,"We need to make plans, Lee."
39736,c.j.,"He's too smart, it's no good. He won't be handled."
39737,c.j.,Yes.
39738,c.j.,Reunion. I'm not going.
39739,c.j.,They came up with it. I agreed because I wanted to be here to see you.
39740,c.j.,You could come and live in Washington with me. I have room.
39741,c.j.,I know why you started smoking again. It's because you use the time it gives you to  work stuff out. You use the cigarettes to stall for time. 
39742,c.j.,"Great, that's great."
39743,c.j.,Dad! Dad!  Hello?
39744,toby,So how's it going?
39745,c.j.,Please tell me everything's okay.
39746,toby,All quiet in the West Wing. 
39747,toby,What's all that honking? You in a parade? They having a parade for you?
39748,c.j.,Let's talk later. 
39749,c.j.," Pull over, I'm driving. Pull over."
39750,c.j.,"I mean... tell me... things like your checkbook, your money, things like that-- what  do you propose to do? Tell me. You're smart, tell me."
39751,c.j.,"Oh? If we drove for 3 hours at 40 miles an hour? I mean, tell me! You are holding on  to something that... "
39752,c.j.,"...can't be willed away by sheer force of personality, dad."
39753,toby," The same is the same, and the same is true for the bailout of the iron industry.  Nothing was said that has not been... that has consistently not been said and is still  being not said. And what's, what's, what's not being said is often uh, more important  than-than, uh, what's stated particularly by Congress."
39754,c.j.,Do you think?
39755,c.j.,"Yeah, they kind of do. "
39756,c.j.,"Dad! Dad, can you get the door?"
39757,c.j.,"No, Dad, no.  He gets confused. Dad, no, wasn't... Marco... wasn't in prison."
39758,c.j.,Is it?
39759,c.j.,That's me.
39760,c.j.,Maybe we should.
39761,c.j.,Are we that old?
39762,c.j.,Oh... Bill Morton form debate. Julia Keller from Cheerleading. Liz Varney from tennis.
39763,c.j.,I don't think I can... face it right now.
39764,c.j.,"After dinner, before the scary dancing."
39765,c.j.,"Mmm! I'm like, I'm like on in a few minutes."
39766,c.j.,Oh. 
39767,c.j.,What am I about to find out?
39768,c.j.,Hmm.
39769,c.j.,"Are you saying you're one of those people who think like, in F. Scott Fitzgerald, their  best years were 20 years prior?"
39770,c.j.,"My name is C.J. Cregg. As you know, I work for the President of the United States.  This is why I was asked to make a short speech for our reunion. It's a terrible  subject, a terrible idea, ""The Promise of a Generation."" So bad, I was going to  start out with a joke and fill the whole thing in with more jokes. But I find the  topic has gotten under my skin while I wasn't paying attention, because every  generation has promise, and every generation fails that promise in some respects.  How can we not? What is promise if not something that's impossible to live up to?  My boss had to recently make his case to the American people that he was worth  re-electing, and it was... not an easy process, nor should it be. And in its wake,  I've been thinking a lot about civility, civic duty, and kindness, and how pervasive  and powerful they are, how enduringly persuasive those qualities are in American life,  and how I see them all around me, day after day. America is a terribly difficult idea  filled with promise and impossible to live up to. Promise is inchoate and promise is  what binds us. "
39771,toby,Something happened. Turn on CNN.
39772,c.j.," I hope it's monumental and not some joke timed for the exact moment I'm  giving my speech, Toby."
39773,toby,"It is. Two car bombs outside our embassies in Asia. One went off, one didn't.  A message to expect more of the same within the next 24 hours: Four."
39774,c.j.,"Oh, jeez. How many...?"
39775,toby,"No casualties, thank God. If you can try and-and get back, uh... There are no direct  flights, but if you connect out of Chicago, you can be in, we think, at 6:30 in the  morning."
39776,c.j.,Um... let me get moving. I'll call you in a few minutes on my way to the airport.
39777,toby,Okay. 
39778,c.j.,"I'm sorry, I have to go. There's been... We have... I'm sorry. I..."
39779,c.j.,"Some bombing threats to embassies. I'm sorry, I have to go. I have to ge to the  airport and get back to D.C."
39780,c.j.,"I have to go. Tal, I-I don't know what to do about this situation."
39781,c.j.,Right.
39782,c.j.,I'll see you next week.
39783,c.j.,"Good morning, Mr. President."
39784,bartlet,Why are they talking to me about the order of the balls?
39785,c.j.,Political Affairs thinks it's important.
39786,c.j.,Aren't we about to demonstrate that pretty clearly right now?
39787,c.j.,The President has a driver's license.
39788,bartlet,"Well, that's only going to be clear if we also hand out decoder rings. Listen, it's  an Inauguration Ball. Let's enjoy ourselves."
39789,bartlet,"Thanks, ladies and gentlemen."
39790,c.j.,"Actually, it's eight Inauguration Balls."
39791,bartlet,You read it?
39792,c.j.,Every draft all night long.
39793,bartlet,You haven't weighed in.
39794,c.j.,"I just did. Anything else, sir?"
39795,bartlet,No.
39796,c.j.,"Eat 'em up, Chief."
39797,bartlet,"Thank you, Claudia."
39798,bartlet,Josh.
39799,josh,It's leaked.
39800,bartlet,How much?
39801,josh,Just buzz. They know there's a restatement of foreign objectives. They know the  committee chairmen haven't been consultated.
39802,bartlet,Yeah.
39803,josh,They know it changed a lot overnight.
39804,bartlet,"Well, their curiosity will be slacked in about 41 minutes. Listen."
39805,josh,"Yes, sir?"
39806,bartlet,I have a problem.
39807,josh,"Well, you're about to propose the most massive shift in foreign policy since the  Marshall Plan, and it's going to be wildly unpopular."
39808,bartlet,"All right, two problems."
39809,josh,"Yes, sir."
39810,bartlet,I don't have a bible.
39811,josh,What do you mean?
39812,bartlet,"I kept changing my mind all week on which bible I wanted to use, and then I finally  settled on the George Washington Bible but we ran into a problem with the New York  Freemasons, which we don't have time to get into."
39813,josh,The Freemasons?
39814,bartlet,"Yeah. Charlie's out hunting one down, but he's not back yet."
39815,josh,"You know, there's nothing that says you have to be sworn in on a bible."
39816,bartlet,Is that true?
39817,josh,You can be sworn in on a Sports Illustrated swimsuit Issue.
39818,bartlet,You think that's a good idea?
39819,josh,No.
39820,bartlet,You sure?
39821,josh,I'll find Charlie.
39822,bartlet,Thanks.
39823,josh,"We're right next to you, sir. Knock 'em all down."
39824,bartlet,Thank you.
39825,leo,Nice suit.
39826,josh,"Hey, Leo, can you tell me anything about what happened to Jack Reese?"
39827,leo,The President asked him to get a Forced Depletion Report under the radar.
39828,josh,On Khundu?
39829,leo,Yeah.
39830,josh,And someone found out.
39831,leo,Hutchinson. It was my fault. Which doesn't excuse...
39832,josh,I don't excuse it.
39833,leo,"I don't know how she could do that, I really don't. I mean I don't want to talk  about it now, but do you suppose her timing could have been any worse?"
39834,josh,I told her all that in no uncertain terms.
39835,leo,"I'll be telling it to her, too."
39836,josh,She knows.
39837,leo,Good.
39838,josh,She's not here. I can't find her. I don't think she's coming. I'll find out where  Charlie is.
39839,leo,"Yes, sir."
39840,leo,"The President's nothing if not contemplative, Senator. The man makes the Prince  of Denmark seem reactionary."
39841,leo,"He's the Commander-in-Chief. He's going to reserve the right to, you know, command."
39842,leo,Mr. Leader.
39843,leo,For a refreshing change of pace.
39844,leo,Then you're all set. There's cheese over there.
39845,leo,Hello.
39846,bartlet,Hi.
39847,leo,"You know, I saw the dress that Abbey's wearing tonight."
39848,bartlet,"Yeah, I may need to get a room."
39849,leo,Do you know it's leaked?
39850,bartlet,"No kidding. In the last two minutes, three people have reminded me what Jefferson  said in his Inaugural."
39851,leo,"""Peace, commerce, honest frienship with all nations and entangling alliances with none."""
39852,bartlet,"The problem is that when he said it, your best chance of getting entangled with an  ally was by rowboat."
39853,leo,Yeah.
39854,bartlet,Charlie's here.
39855,bartlet,Thank you.
39856,bartlet,Donnie's Motel?
39857,bartlet,They didn't have one in the House Library?
39858,bartlet,Okay.
39859,bartlet,Mr. Chief Justice.
39860,c.j.,That's when the Chief Justice will ask you to raise your right hand and place your  left hand on the Bible.
39861,bartlet,What do I do then?
39862,c.j.,You raise your right hand and put your left hand on the Bible.
39863,bartlet,And will there be someone who'll tell me when it's time to do that?
39864,c.j.,You mock me?
39865,bartlet,I do. May I continue?
39866,c.j.,"Yes, sir."
39867,bartlet, Can we pull foreign policy up on the prompter?
39868,toby,"144 on the prompter, please. It's going to take a second."
39869,bartlet, What's going on?
39870,toby,"The Chief Justice-- wrote a dissenting opinion in Sea Northern v. Arizona, saying  that an association between asbestos and a higher risk of cancer in later life was  insufficient to merit relief."
39871,bartlet,So what?
39872,toby,He...  I don't know how to say this. He wrote it in meter.
39873,bartlet,A meter?
39874,toby,He wrote a dissenting opinion in what I am almost certain is trochiac tetrometer.  Will?
39876,bartlet,What are you talking about?
39877,toby,He starts in the fourth graph.
39878,bartlet,"""Fear of cancer from asbestos, fuzzy science manifestos."""
39879,toby,A guy just faxed this to Will.
39880,bartlet,Which one's Will?
39881,toby,He is. 
39882,toby,"It's a loud syllable followed by a soft syllable, which is a trochaic foot, then  there's four per comma, which is tetrameter."
39883,c.j.,You think he's trying to tell us something through code?
39884,toby,"144's on the prompter, sir."
39885,bartlet,"""America cannot be the world's policeman. America cannot enforce its own values, its  own standards across the world. Yet when it's in our clear an vital interests...""  We're being candid at least."
39886,toby,This is State Department language.
39887,bartlet,"No kidding. Look, I understand I present a uniform gap, but I want to mean what I say."
39888,toby,"Will, you're going to meet with my counterpart, the State Department Communications  Director. He likes to have input into foreign policy language."
39890,toby,I would really think so.
39891,leo,That's all. Thank you.
39892,bartlet,The Chief Justice wrote a poem.
39893,leo,He's trying to get the Court to adopt powdered wigs.
39894,bartlet,What do you mean?
39895,leo,Exactly what I said.
39896,bartlet,Powdered wigs?
39897,leo,"Like the British magistrates. I'm telling you, I think there might be a problem."
39898,bartlet,You think he stayed to long at the fair?
39899,leo,He's not a young man.
39900,bartlet,Neither am I.
39901,leo,This is what I'm talking about.
39902,bartlet,This foreign policy language is ridiculous.
39903,leo,It'll get fixed.
39904,bartlet,What's going on in Khundu?
39905,leo,Yeah.
39906,bartlet,"I got a short security cable this morning about civil unrest in the Republic of  Equatorial Khundu, and I had to reach for an atlas."
39907,leo,Near the Ivory Coast.
39908,bartlet,I know that now.
39909,leo,"The government forces run by the Arkutu have apparently killed as many as 200 Induye  on the streets of Bitanga, which is the capitol."
39910,bartlet,Two warring tribes?
39911,leo,"Well, no, one tribes warring, and the other one's getting killed. But the point is  we got about 500 American missionaries."
39912,bartlet,They're being evacuated?
39913,leo,"Yes, sir."
39914,bartlet,Okay. Thank you.
39915,bartlet,Yeah?
39916,bartlet,From where?
39917,bartlet,They do?
39918,bartlet,And they need several days notice?
39919,bartlet,Why?
39920,bartlet,Are they not sure where it is?
39921,bartlet,I'm going to be using the Bartlet Bible. That's at the New Hampshire Historical Society.
39922,bartlet,Yes.
39924,bartlet,Hoping beyond hope.
39927,bartlet,"I can't remember your name, but are you asking me out on a date?"
39929,bartlet,Okay.
39936,josh,Yeah.
39938,josh,For?
39940,josh,Could you hang onto mine for me till Sunday?
39942,josh,Thanks.
39944,josh,"God, Donna, please tell me that's not going to be the only thing he's wearing."
39946,josh,I'll be wearing a tuxedo from Gary's. Who's been on the phone?
39948,josh,They decided to change the foreign policy language 20 minutes ago. How do they  know already?
39950,josh,The President's asked Toby and Will to look at the language.
39952,josh,Keep the President out of it. I've asked Toby and Will to look at the language.
39954,josh,Thanks.
39956,josh, I don't want to know how you know that.
39957,bartlet,"No, he was talking to me, your Eminence.  Your Excellency, I got a very  sketchy intelligence report on the violence in the capitol about an hour ago."
39958,bartlet,I didn't know that.
39959,bartlet,Yes.
39960,bartlet,No.
39988,toby,"I throw a rubber ball against the window, that means you come to me."
39990,toby,"As my frustration level grows, so does the velocity of the ball against the window."
39992,toby,Good.
39994,toby,Did you ask for transcripts of public remarks from Manchester?
39996,toby,That's what they are.
39998,toby,And the 14 other cartoons outside.
40000,toby,So we're dumping State's language?
40002,toby,Which means we'll need some of our own.
40004,toby,"I'm talking to myself right now, so there's no reason for you to be answering."
40006,toby,No.
40007,bartlet,Yeah?
40008,bartlet,And?
40009,bartlet,I can't?
40010,bartlet,Just as the disciples intended.
40011,bartlet,The Jefferson bible doesn't warp?
40012,bartlet,"Probably. Speaking of New Hampshire, don't I own the Bartlet Bible?"
40013,bartlet,I know. I bought it.
40014,bartlet,And they won't loan it back to me so that I can be inaugurated?
40015,bartlet,Yeah. His name is really Mr. Cravenly? You're not making that up?
40016,bartlet,"Okay, would you tell him that I'd like very much to use my family's Bible, which my  family has bought at least twice now."
40017,bartlet,"You know, a couple hundred people got killed today in Khundu."
40018,bartlet,The Arkutu control the government and they're killing...
40019,bartlet,I'm sorry?
40020,bartlet,"Yeah, mm-hmm."
40021,bartlet,No.
40022,bartlet,Yeah. Ask Bob Slattery to come over here.
40023,c.j.,"At that time, the Chief Justice will ask the President to raise his right hand and  place his left hand on the Bible."
40024,c.j.,Yeah?
40025,c.j.,Okay. Katie?
40026,c.j.,"Well, I guess we'll find out six days from now, but thank you to the Smothers Brothers. "
40027,c.j.,Good night.
40028,c.j.,No way.
40029,c.j.,"Stop trying to get us together, okay? If I wanted Danny, I could have him. And he's  still a jackass from the foreign Ops vote and many other things, so tell him I'm  getting my hair done."
40030,c.j.,There was no way you could tell me he was right behind me? You couldn't fit that in? 
40031,c.j., In here.
40032,c.j.,Yes?
40033,c.j.,How...
40034,c.j.,How do you know?
40035,c.j.,"If I help you find the cricket player, you'll consider it a favor and not the White  House cooperating with your story?"
40036,c.j.,Thank you.
40037,c.j.,Is there anything else?
40038,c.j.,Good.
40039,bartlet,Yeah.
40040,bartlet,"Bobby, what's going on?"
40041,bartlet,The Catholic Church has better intelligence than we do?
40042,bartlet,None?
40043,bartlet,How many are dead right now?
40044,bartlet,Estimate.
40045,bartlet,"Bobby, I don't want to make noise but I want to see a forced depletion report.  I want to know how many we'd lose and I want to do it without going three rounds  in the newspaper with Miles Hutchison. Who do we have at the Pentagon who could  do this for us?"
40046,bartlet,You trust him?
40047,bartlet,Tell him I want to see forced depletion on a peacekeeping force in Khundu. And tell  him we'll do our best to keep it away from the Secretary's office.
40048,bartlet,Thank you.
40049,c.j.,"First things first. We're going to have to learn how to pronounce it. I learned it  as ""Kuhn-doo."" The Republic of Equatorial Khundu."
40050,c.j.,Mark.
40051,c.j.,We don't know.
40052,c.j.,We don't know. Danny?
40053,c.j.,"Well, I don't."
40054,c.j.,Did they...?
40055,c.j.,"No, I didn't know that."
40056,c.j.,"It means ""cleanse."""
40057,c.j.,The White House is monitering the situation very carefully.
40058,c.j.,Katie.
40059,c.j.,"15,000. Sheila?"
40060,josh,Yep?
40062,josh,Hmm?
40064,josh,"Wondering whether the Nuclear regulatory Commission really needs $100,000 for a  ""morale improvement program."" It's got to be a pretty critical lap dance."
40066,josh,Did you knock?
40068,josh,And?
40070,josh,That's a good story.
40072,josh,Donna...
40074,josh,Most of the homes and offices of the people who live on this planet.
40076,josh,What's he doing showing you a fax from the Commander of the Seventh Fleet?
40078,josh,Fantastic.
40080,josh,How do you know what he was showing you?
40082,josh,Are you serious with these questions?
40084,josh,"Then let it strike you that way, and please find out what they mean by ""morale  improvement program"" so I can get back to-- you know-- actual people."
40085,bartlet,"Hey, I changed my mind about the Bible."
40086,bartlet,I don't know. I never... it just seems parochial. I hate saying that.
40087,bartlet,"There's a Bible in North Hampton, Masachusetts, that Johnathon Edwards used. Let's  get that."
40088,leo,"Good morining, Mr. President."
40089,bartlet,"""Grace is but glory begun and glory is but grace perfected."" I made my Bible selection."
40090,leo,"Listen to this, please. The Supreme Court is striking down the use of prior offenses  as a factor in Stiles v. Rhode Island. The Chief Justice writes a concurring opinion:  ""Guilty or not guilty, past convictions frustrate the judge who wonders should your  fate abate."""
40091,bartlet,It's awkwardly worded.
40092,leo,"No, it's not. it's 22 syllables."
40093,bartlet,"Oh, God."
40094,leo,"Two, four, six, eight. Two. And it's suppose to sound like this: ""Guilty, or not  guilty, past convictions frustrate, the judge who wonders should your fate, abate.""  It's a cinquain."
40095,bartlet,A what?
40096,leo,Cinquain.
40097,bartlet,How do you know?
40098,leo,I know things. And I'm worried about the Chief Justice.
40099,bartlet,And I'm worried about the White House making that suggestion.
40100,leo,"He's writing in verse, plus the powdered wigs."
40101,bartlet,Wasn't that a rumor?
40102,leo,Yes.
40103,bartlet,"All right, listen. I've asked for a forced depletion report on action in Khundu."
40104,leo,Who'd you ask?
40105,bartlet,Slatterly got Jack Reese.
40106,leo,What'd it say?
40107,bartlet,"The best scenario is that simply by engaging, the Arkutu lay down their weapons,  but that doesn't seem likey, so we'd lose people."
40108,leo,Yeah.
40109,bartlet,More if they go into the countryside.
40110,leo,What do you expect?
40111,bartlet,Yeah.
40112,leo,Toby's working on new policy language.
40113,bartlet,I'm sorry?
40114,leo,I say Toby's working on new foreign policy language.
40115,bartlet,Good.
40116,leo,Can I see the report?
40117,bartlet,You should.
40118,leo,Thank you.
40122,toby,What are you doing?
40124,toby,You're not thinking about policy language?
40126,toby,Because we have five days.
40127,toby,You really comfortable going through life with a name like Elsie Snuffin?
40128,toby,"Well, the idea isn't going to walk in here and announce itself as being important  and take a place on the top of the pile."
40132,toby,Yeah.
40134,toby,Mr. Bailey...
40136,toby,"Define those values for me, please."
40138,toby,"Just out of curiosity, how are you going to enforce a universal global right to  education?"
40139,toby,"What exactly are you doing here, anyway?"
40140,toby,Excellent.
40142,toby,"I read it, I think, 16 years ago. It was about El Salvador and he had it stricken  from the record and there was a reason."
40144,toby,"I don't know, but things have reasons."
40146,toby,"Yes, they do."
40148,toby,You're talking about Khundu? That's what the hell this is about?
40150,toby,This isn't what I meat by drafting new language.
40152,toby,"Making the old language sound better. You're asking the two of us to create foreign  policy by ourselves. That's usually not a good idea. You've got your Pentagon, the  NSC and-- what do you call it?-- the State Department."
40154,toby,This language proposes a new doctrine for the use of force. That we use force  whenever we see an injustice we want to correct. Like Mother Theresa with  first-strike capabilities.
40156,toby,"Oh, you've had too many dinners with daddy. Please go back to finding new language  for the foreign section!"
40159,toby,But what?
40161,toby,"You're wrong. And if he did, I'd be fired shortly thereafter."
40163,toby, You go back to doing whatever it is you do.
40164,bartlet,"Hey, is this it?"
40165,bartlet,Good to meet you.
40166,bartlet,Of course.
40167,bartlet,This?
40168,bartlet,It's huge.
40169,bartlet,"Actually, it can't be."
40170,bartlet,"The First Lady has to hold this in her hand. This one's going to take the First Lady,  the Chief Justice and the Second Circuit Court of Appeals."
40171,bartlet,Okay... Mr. Carlton?
40172,bartlet,"Sorry. Thanks. Charlie's going to take care of you.  Charlie, that Bible's  the size of a Volkswagon. Can we get the Washington Bible?"
40173,bartlet,Thank you.
40174,leo,Okay. Europe?
40175,leo,State's going to issue an alert?
40176,leo,"Okay, thanks. "
40177,leo,Miles?  What's the general thinking in Khundu?
40178,leo,That's what's happening at the State Department. I want to know what's happening  at Central Command.
40179,leo,"That's not what I mean. We're getting INTEL that isn't making it onto CNN, but  that's a matter of a couple of hours. Truly horrible accounts of mass slaughtering..."
40180,leo,...that should make us at least want to investigate whether there's a genocide.
40181,leo,"Okay, so I'll go to the President with it."
40182,leo,"A] The guy is the President. B] He's been leading one for 3 years, 51 weeks and  three days. How much more training would you like him to have? And C] It's not a  thousand. We saw a forced depletion report, it's 150."
40183,leo,Yes.
40184,leo,"Look, from time to time, just to expedite things, Nancy will print..."
40185,leo,The guy was following a direct order.
40186,leo,I don't give a damn what....
40187,leo,"I said I don't give a damn what your problem is, Miles. The man wants to know if he  sends troops, how many are going to die."
40188,leo,"He asks you and three days mange to go by before he sees it, Mr. Secretary. Yet  miraculously, the Wall Street Journal, on day two, the numbers inflated all to hell.  It's 150, not a thousand."
40189,leo,"I don't know what you mean when you say ""in Khundu."" Nah... yeah, I do."
40190,leo,Okay.
40192,bartlet,Toby been taking his pants off again? That's just something he does.
40194,bartlet,How's it going?
40196,bartlet,Good.
40198,bartlet,Yeah. What's hard is that foreign policy has become a statement of what we won't do.
40200,bartlet,"""A new doctrine for a new century, based not just on our interests, but on our  values across the world."" Well, that's pretty spicey stuff."
40202,bartlet,"Yeah, I know. Why is a Khundunese life worth less to me than an American life?"
40204,bartlet,That was ballsy.
40206,bartlet,You Tom Bailey's son?
40208,bartlet,Talk about the very model of a modern Major General.
40210,c.j.,I found your ramp signal agent.
40211,c.j.,"We don't send anyone anywhere who doesn't work for us, but I understand he's gotten  a salary-bump and he's co-captian of a local cricket team."
40212,c.j.,And?
40213,c.j.,Mystery solved.
40214,c.j.,Come here.
40215,c.j.,This is ridiculous. It's been ridiculous ever since you came back.
40216,c.j.,Would you mind if I turned out the lights?
40217,c.j.,It's just easier this way. For three years I have been thinking about what might  have been if it weren't....
40218,c.j.,...for the conflict.
40219,c.j.,"And I'm almost over it. I mean, I am right there and you come back with scruffy face  and your jokes and your incredible talent and your way of getting at... getting at me.  And I was thinking if we could... "
40220,c.j.,Do you like this perfume?
40221,c.j.,Do you like this blouse?
40222,c.j.,Do you?
40223,c.j.,Come here.
40224,c.j.,Remember when you asked me what exactly I'd do to have you?
40225,c.j.,I'd do that.
40226,c.j.,"Good evening. I have revised estimates for Khundu. We said 15,000 yesterday.  Intelligence reports are putting it closer to 25... 25,000."
40227,josh,Hey.
40228,josh,He in?
40229,josh,What's that?
40230,josh,You're sitting with us in the staff section.
40231,josh,Would it be weird if I just walked around with a military dress saber?
40232,josh,Okay. He's in a security briefing?
40233,josh,"Navy dress uniform has 13 buttons on the pants. I mean, traditions tradition, but  I'd be concerned about the level of bladder discipline that requires, wouldn't you?"
40234,josh,Nothing.
40235,bartlet,We'll send condolences. What's next?
40236,bartlet,Okay.
40237,bartlet,"Well, if he's old enough to marry Jerry Lee Lewis, I guess he's old enough to be  king of Bhutan. What's next?"
40238,bartlet,Coast Guards got it?
40239,bartlet,"What's happening? I'm sorry, what's happening in the REK?"
40240,bartlet,"Well, a proclamation ought to do the trick. What's the CIA know that I should know?"
40241,bartlet,"All right, thank you."
40242,bartlet,"Yeah. Hey, I changed my mind. Not the Washington Bible."
40243,bartlet,Yeah.
40244,bartlet,"Yeah, I'm going to use my father's."
40245,leo,"Good evening, Mr. President."
40246,bartlet,Did you talk to Hutchinson?
40247,leo,Yeah.
40248,bartlet," Tell Josh I'll just be a minute, okay?"
40249,bartlet,Did he tell me to shut up and let him run the Pentagon?
40250,leo,In so many words.
40251,bartlet,How many?
40252,leo,"Not that many. As a matter of fact, we didn't get that far. I got Jack Reese in  some trouble."
40253,bartlet,So Hutchinson know I've seen forced depletion.
40254,leo,Yeah.
40255,bartlet,"He should be pissed at me, not Jack Reese."
40256,leo,He should be pissed at you? The Secretary of Defense should be pissed at...
40257,bartlet,Don't worry about it. Right?
40258,leo,Sure. No problem.
40259,bartlet,Don't worry about it.
40260,leo,"Yes, sir."
40261,bartlet,Clark says neighbors are swapping family members in Khundu.
40262,leo,Really?
40263,bartlet,"Also, there's a new king of Bhutan. And he's been bar mitzvaed and everything."
40264,leo,All right.
40265,bartlet,"Hey, this guy you hired for the Inauguration speech gave me a little back chat a  few minutes ago."
40266,leo,Bailey?
40267,bartlet,"Yeah, he was using a floor speech about El Salvador I gave 98 years ago to demonstrate  that the U.S. should send troops to Khundu. Rhetorically, I said, ""Why is a Khundunese  life worth less to me than an American life?"" And he said, ""I dont know, sir, but it is."""
40268,leo,I'll try to get some better information.
40269,bartlet,Thank you.
40270,leo,"Thank you, Mr. President."
40271,josh,"Good evening, Mr. President."
40272,bartlet,"Hey, Josh. There's intelligence that Khundunese neighbors in the country are swapping  family members."
40273,josh,"I'm sorry, I don't understand."
40274,bartlet,"For the night, they're swapping family members you know, and sleeping in each other's  houses."
40275,josh,"Yes, sir."
40276,bartlet,What's going on?
40277,josh,"You know what, nothing I can't deal with."
40278,bartlet,State?
40279,josh,I did just get off the phone with Jeffrey Tomlinson and Bob Bibbet.
40280,bartlet,Tell them...
40281,josh,"They're under... I'm sorry, sir, they're under the impression that the entire  foreign policy section is being rewritten."
40282,bartlet,It's not.
40283,josh,"I know, they just... asked me to emphasize that the current language has been vetted  with the ranking members of House Armed Services."
40284,bartlet,The language is being polished.
40285,josh,That's what I told them. They just asked me to remind you that their version also  reflects existing treaties some of which....
40286,bartlet,"Some of which have my name on them. So tell Jeff Tomlison and baby Bob to take a  deep knee bend, would you? I'm just as big a cotton candy ass as they are."
40287,josh,"Yes, sir."
40288,bartlet,You're just going to let that hang in the air?
40289,josh,"Of course not, sir. You're a much bigger cotton candy ass than they are."
40290,bartlet,Damn right.
40291,josh,Anything else?
40292,bartlet,No.
40293,josh,"Thank you, Mr. President."
40294,josh,What's going on?
40296,josh,To where?
40298,josh,Air Force Base?
40300,josh,When?
40302,josh,What happened?
40304,josh,The reality of the fast-track Navy guys is they're going to bop around the globe a lot.
40306,josh,"You can't begin to concieve of the internal politics of the Pentagon. Right now,  Hutchinson and his boys..."
40308,josh,"Well, no one's told me about it and I'm not going to ask."
40310,josh,Three doors you definitely want to knock on to complain about your boyfriend being  transferred to the Italian Alps.
40312,josh,Is he complaining?
40314,josh,I ask you that because sometimes people request transfers.
40316,josh,No.
40318,josh,Jack Reese got transfered.
40319,josh,If you tell me you got a crush on Reese...
40320,josh,Zoey's lover?
40321,josh,Isn't his name Jean-Paul?
40322,josh,Yes.
40323,josh,Intelligence says neighbors in Khundu are sleeping in each others houses.
40324,josh,It means they're making people in the same house rape each other on the promise  their lives will be spared.
40325,josh,Nah.
40327,toby,"During moments of peak frustration. When the Speaker of the House threatens to repeal  the 16th Amendment. A couple of Yankee games. And there was the time Congress censured  my boss. But it's always held up, that window. That window's a game-day player."
40329,toby,Leo was just in here.  What did you say to the President last night?
40331,toby,I know. What did you say?
40333,toby,What did you say?
40335,toby,Didn't we talk about this?
40337,toby,But you gave it a shot anyway?
40339,toby,With the President?
40341,toby,"The Dow plummets because of casual conversations with this man, but that's not the point."
40343,toby,You can't get in his head this close to something this important. You've got to keep  the train on the tracks.
40345,toby,"No, no ""but"" at the end of that. Not on this one. This one haunts him. It haunts everyone."
40347,toby,How is it?
40349,toby,That's foreign policy.
40351,toby,"Okay, keep the ancient Romans out of the first ten rows, and we're fine."
40353,toby,To model it?
40355,toby,The U.S. doesn't help create freedom from tyranny?
40357,toby,The watchword of all mankind? I don't know what the means.
40359,toby,"The speech is good. It's better than good. There's one paragraph that's vague, and we're  going to live with it. "
40361,toby,I'll be in my office.
40363,toby,There were maybe four people in the room when I had that conversation.
40365,toby,Okay.
40366,c.j.,"Ghana, Nigeria, and what did I say?"
40367,c.j.,"Ghana, Nigeria and Zaire. The Arkutu meet with representatives from those countries.  They met for three hours, and we're told the talks were amicable but that no progress  was made. Steve?"
40368,c.j.,The problem is the Convention distinguishes between acts of genocide and genocide.
40369,c.j.,It does. Mark?
40370,c.j.,I don't know. Danny?
40371,c.j.,Two below with the wind chill. That's a full lid. Good night.
40372,c.j.,Yes.
40373,c.j.,"Danny, I have no idea. I have no idea what the distinction is. All I know is I got a memo  from State-- close your notebook-- a memo from State to make sure not to call it genocide. "
40374,c.j.,"No, we're not going to do that anymore. We're not going to talk about Shareef."
40375,c.j.,"Okay, then what?"
40376,c.j.,"Good day to you, sir."
40377,c.j.,"I said, good day, sir."
40378,c.j.,"Nobody takes me seriously when I say ""good day, sir."""
40379,c.j.,Did you find the pilot?
40380,c.j.,I can't remember his name.
40381,c.j.,Yeah.
40382,c.j.,You don't even want to say you were wrong and apologize for your superior attitude lately.
40383,c.j.,Rifts at the Pentagon.
40384,c.j.,The President hasn't rescinded any Executive Orders.
40385,c.j.,"Tha President appreciates it, and it's not like it's anything new. I don't know who the  Jets are and who the Sharks are, but it's Fitzwallace and Hutchinson."
40386,c.j.,Josh's office. You can get it from Donna.
40387,c.j.,"Hey, what are Executive Orders 11...?"
40388,c.j.,Yeah.
40389,toby,"All right, last looks."
40390,josh,"C.J. says there are three references to ""mankind."" Can we make it ""humankind""?"
40391,toby,Yeah.
40392,josh,"Foreign Relations would like ""war"" changed to ""war and strife""."
40393,toby,Yeah.
40394,josh,"Where we say, ""tens of billions wasted,"" the OMB would like us to say, ""billions and  billions wasted."""
40395,toby,No.
40396,josh,Then that's all for me.
40397,toby, Got those?
40399,toby,All right. Let's leave the building. What do you say?
40400,josh,Anyone playing at Iota tonight?
40401,toby,I don't know. Let's just go. Ask C.J.
40402,josh, There's that club called Iota in Arlington. They usually have some good people.  You want to come out?
40404,josh,Ginger or Bonnie will do that.
40406,josh,Okay.
40407,toby,He's frustated with the foreign polciy section. He wanted to change it.
40408,josh,The language?
40409,toby,No. U.S. foreign policy. Hang on. Will?
40411,josh,"Listen, the President takes seriously the question of whether or not to risk American blood."
40413,josh,He can't just send people someplace.
40415,toby,"No. ""Do what we can to fulfill humanity's promise."""
40417,toby,No. Leadership wants to cut it.
40419,josh,It doesn't. The voters do. The voters that you champion and that I can't stand.
40421,josh,What's his level of frustration?
40422,toby,It's high.
40423,josh,He's here on a temp job. He's that invested in...? 
40424,josh,"This never happened before, has it?"
40425,toby,"No. No, it hasn't."
40427,bartlet,"Charlie, I'm going to change my mind again on te Bible."
40428,bartlet,Aren't you afraid that one day I'm just going to kick your ass like it's never been  kicked?
40429,bartlet,Let's go with the Washington Bible.
40430,bartlet,Just put it on a plane.
40431,bartlet,What do the Freemasons have to do with it?
40432,bartlet,Take a train.
40433,bartlet,Buy three tickets.
40434,bartlet,Are you trying to tell me that Freemasons don't like me?
40435,bartlet,Thank you.
40436,leo,Hey.
40437,bartlet,I saw C.J. smiling before. Has something good happened?
40438,leo,Yeah.
40439,bartlet,What?
40440,leo,You didn't rescind two Executive Orders.
40441,bartlet,I didn't?
40442,leo,It was an NSC Presidential Decision Directive-- it's different.
40443,bartlet,It's not different.
40444,leo,"It is, and that's how I was able to look C.J. in the eye and say you didn't rescind  11905, and that's how she was able to look Danny Concannon in the eye and do the same."
40445,bartlet,"Well, then it was a dodged bullet."
40446,leo,"No, sir, we didn't dodge nothing. They hit what they aimed at."
40447,bartlet,"Leo, come on..."
40448,leo,"It was a shot across the bow, it was. This guy giving it to Danny."
40449,bartlet,You're being paranoid.
40450,leo,"And you're being unbelievabley naive, sir."
40451,bartlet,You think in your wildest dreams that Hutchinson's running an offense? He's that pissed  that I asked for forced Depletion Report he's going to show me in Danny's byline I go to  Khundu and here's what happened in Bermuda?
40452,leo,"I do. In my wildest dreams, I do."
40453,bartlet, Abbey's already gone to bed. I should get up there.
40454,leo,"Hey, the Chief Justice wrote another opinion in verse. Want to hear it?"
40455,bartlet,No. 
40456,leo," ""I say this denial is not fit for trial."""
40457,bartlet, Good night.
40458,leo,"Thank you, Mr. President."
40459,bartlet,Abbey. 
40460,bartlet,Abigail. 
40461,bartlet,"Abbey, the kids are eating sugar. "
40463,bartlet,"How you doing? You know I gave the kids candy all the time, right?"
40465,bartlet,Yes.
40467,bartlet,"Well, it was for sale, and I wanted it."
40469,bartlet,I'm going to stay up for a bit and read and watch some news.
40471,bartlet,His grandkids were in here?
40473,bartlet,I don't.
40475,bartlet,For the record...
40477,bartlet,Frederick the Great told his generals... to defend everything is to defend nothing.
40479,bartlet,"I don't really know what that means, do you?"
40481,bartlet,"Well, that makes two of us."
40483,bartlet,I'll be in soon.
40485,bartlet,I was their dealer. Live with it.
40487,c.j., Tank and tonic.
40488,josh,"Uh, two. Cynthia, I left a message for Donna. She might call."
40489,c.j.,The guy across the street is beating up a pregnant woman. You don't go over and try  and stop it?
40490,toby,"Guy across the street is beating up anybody, I like to think I go over and try to stop  it, but we're not talking about the President going to Asia or the President going to  Rwanda or the President going to Qumar. We're talking about the Preisdent sending other  people's kids to do that."
40491,c.j.,"That's always what we're talking about, and in addition to being somebody's kids,  they're soldiers and sailors, and if we're about freedom from tyranny, then we're about  freedom from tyranny, and if we're not, we should shut up."
40492,josh,Yes.
40493,toby,"Back at the office, you were telling Will..."
40494,c.j.,He said that to Will 'cause that's what we say.
40495,toby,You were't even there.
40496,c.j.,It's what we always say.
40497,toby,"On Sunday, he's taking an oath to ensure domestic tranquilty."
40498,c.j.,"And to establish justice and promote the general welfare. Stand by while atrocities are  taking place, and you're an accomplice."
40499,toby,"I'm not indifferent to that, but knuckleheaded self-destruction is never going to burn  itself out, you really want to send your kids across the street into the fire?"
40500,c.j.,Want to? No. Should I? Yes.
40501,toby,Why? And don't give me a lefty answer.
40502,c.j.,A lefty answer is all I've got.
40503,toby,Why are you sending your kids across the street?
40504,c.j.,"'Cause those are somebody's kids, too."
40505,bartlet,"Leo McGarry, please."
40506,josh,"I'm not talking about fighting two wars at once, I'm not talking about fighting wars.  Intervening when there's violence against people who are defenseless..."
40507,toby,"Fine, but if we go here, then that means they can go there, and look, there's more  injustice over there."
40508,josh,"We elect these people. And not for nothing, but if'd had been the world's policemen  in the 30's, you and I..."
40509,toby,We would have had a lot more relatives.
40510,josh,That's right.
40511,josh,Where the hell is Donna?
40512,toby,Leave her alone-- she's having a last night with... What's his name?
40513,josh,"I called her at Jack's, and I paged her."
40514,toby,Leave her alone.
40515,c.j.,I've got to bo back to the office.
40516,josh,What happened?
40517,c.j.," Danny screwed me, and somebody on one of our staffs screwed the  rest of us."
40518,toby,I'll get the call.  This is Toby.
40519,toby,We're on our way.
40520,toby,"Well, Will's never been called in the middle of the night by the office of the President.  I think he should experience that before he leaves."
40521,josh,Definitely.
40525,c.j.,I don't believe this.
40526,c.j.,"This is, A] it was garbage. That was... that was totally out of left field on the piece  on the unnamed White House source..."
40527,c.j.,"What do you mean, it wasn't yours?"
40528,c.j.,Who dropped it in?
40529,c.j.,They dropped it in?
40530,c.j.,Without your knowledge?
40531,c.j.,And you're okay with that?
40532,c.j.,What was the name of the researcher?
40533,c.j.,"No, the researchers looking out for his future. He's twenty-three and times a-wastin'.  I want to give him a Lexus. What's his name?"
40534,c.j.,What's his name?!
40535,c.j.,Asking how many nuts and bolts doesn't get this quote.
40536,c.j.,I sent you to Donna when you asked...
40537,c.j.,"No, but that day, yesterday, her boyfriend Jack Reese, a Navy Lieutenant Commander,  was reassigned from a White House poistion, and she was very angry about it."
40538,c.j.,They're not on the record!
40539,c.j.,Yeah?
40540,josh,"Well. This is gonna, I think, get interesting now."
40541,toby,Yes.
40542,josh,This is gonna get interesting.
40543,toby,It will capture our interest...
40544,josh,...and will be written about...
40545,toby,"...in English, I would think as well as..."
40546,josh,Arabic?
40547,toby,You can say that two times. I suppose you can't blame Will completely.
40549,toby,This is entirely your fault.
40551,toby,You like Europe. He likes Europe. You could have talked about Europe.
40553,toby,"Than make it the subject. He says, ""here's this El Salvador speech I gave a long time  ago,"" and you say?"
40555,toby,Yes.
40556,c.j.,"Listen, something's happened."
40557,toby,What?
40558,c.j.,A White House aide is quoted in tomorrow's Post.
40559,c.j.,All right.
40560,bartlet,"We're for freedom of speech everywhere. We're for freedom to worship everywhere. We're  for freedom to learn... for everybody. And because, in our time, you can build a bomb  in your country and bring it to my country, what goes on in you country is very much my  business. And so we are for freedom from tyranny everywhere, whether in the guise of  political oppresion, Toby, or economic slavery, Josh, or religious fanaticism, C.J.  That most fundamental idea cannot be met with merely our support. It has to be met with  our strength. Diplomatically, economically, materially. And if pharoah still don't free  the slaves, then he gets the plagues, or my cavalry, whichever gets there first. The  USTR will go crazy and say that we're not considering global trade. Committee members  will go crazy and say I haven't consulted enough. And the Arab world will just go  indescriminately crazy. No country has ever had a doctrine of intervention when only  humanitarian interests were at stake. That streaks going to end Sunday at noon. So, if  you're on board with this, what I need you to do..."
40561,toby,"What we're going to do is comb through the language again, this time with counsel."
40562,c.j.," Carol? It's me. I'm going to need new talking points for the full Cabinet,  no embargoed excepts..."
40563,toby,"We have to move from a lone rogue, to a posse."
40564,bartlet, Do I just keep standing here?
40565,leo,No.  Excuse me! 
40566,leo,It is so ordered.
40567,toby,"All right, everything else off the table.  What were you going to say before? "
40569,c.j.,Danny's got a piece out tomorrow on fault lines between the White House and the Pentagon.
40570,toby,He writes that story twice a year.
40571,c.j.,"A researcher gathering background spoke to three people, one of whom was Donna, because  your office is one of the places that keeps breakdowns of how Pentagon staff are detailed  to the White House. The researcher was giving an unprompted quote, which he gave to  Danny's editor, who put it in the piece."
40572,josh,What was the quote?
40573,c.j.,"Everyone's very loyal to everyone else around here, unless you wear a uniform."
40574,josh,"I know it sounds like it was Donna 'cause of the situation with Jack, but there's no way  she gives that quote to a reporter."
40575,c.j.,She didn't think she was on the record.
40576,josh,There's no way Donna said that.
40577,c.j.,"She did. She just called me and told me she did, which I give her credit for."
40578,josh,You do?
40579,toby,Heat of the moment. And bad timing.
40580,josh,I don't have time for this now.  Neither do you.
40581,bartlet,"""Set free the oppressed, break every yoke, clothe the naked and your light shall break  forth like the dawn, and the glory of the Lord shall be your rear guard."""
40582,leo,"Ten minutes ago, you promised me you'd go easy on the Moses references."
40583,bartlet,That was Isaiah.
40584,leo,Still. They frighten people?
40585,bartlet,Who?
40586,leo,Me.
40587,bartlet,"Well, then here's to swimmin' with bow-legged women."
40588,leo,"Ah, that tastes like... nothing at all. It has no taste or properties of any kind. You  can expect to see pieces quoting Pentagon sources on how many lives we'd lose in Khundu.  And a search and rescue group, diving for a lost helicopter prop, is going to find a  piece of a Gulfstream."
40589,bartlet,"I think you're wrong. But if you're right, then okay. We should all have a little skin  in this."
40590,leo,"Well, then, that much we've accomplished."
40591,bartlet,So we're doing well so far.
40592,leo,Sunday noon?
40593,bartlet,Sunday noon.
40594,leo,"Thank you, Mr. President."
40596,bartlet,"Not because, no. Not because of Laurel and Hardy. That was simply the confluence of  the final, you know, and... also, by the way, from the mouths of babe-- like yourself.  Seriously, from the mouths of babes and clowns come-- Listen, there's no reason why  anyone needs to know about Laurel and Hardy."
40598,bartlet,Too cold for a parade. Bunch of tanned-ass Southerners.
40600,bartlet,Which is to the south of New Hampshire. Don't tell me geographic stereotypes.
40602,bartlet,I walked to school every morning in weather colder than this.
40604,bartlet,"That's right, baby. Just a camel hair coat, leather gloves, a varsity scarf and these wits."
40605,bartlet,It's here?
40606,bartlet,What is the problem? It was in New York. It could have gotten here on a fast horse.
40607,bartlet,And?
40608,bartlet,Because?
40609,bartlet,And it didn't come in last night...
40610,bartlet,Three for the freemasons and one for the Bible.
40611,bartlet,Three hotel rooms and four train tickets.
40612,bartlet,"Okay. You know what? Washington didn't bring his own Bible, he just assumed one would be  provided, which, frankly, isn't unreasonable. Guy wants you to swear an oath on a Bible,  he ought to be packing a Bible. Washington had someone get one from across the street."
40613,bartlet,"Just common courtesy I think. ""Place your hand on this Bible."" And, ""Oh, can I use your  Bible?"" That's not right."
40614,c.j.,"Good morning, Mr. President."
40615,bartlet,Why are they talking to me about the order of the balls?
40616,c.j.,Political Affairs thinks it's important.
40617,c.j.,Aren't we about to demonstrate that pretty clearly?
40618,toby,Did you throw up?
40620,toby,About time.
40622,toby,Still.
40623,c.j.,They're yuckling him about the order of the balls.
40624,c.j.,That's the U.S. Marine Corps Band right there. The Commandant's Own. These guys practice  four hours a day. So you think the Chief Justice has lost his mind.
40625,toby,"I didn't say he's ""lost his mind,"" I said... I said he lost his mind and Leo said he's  lost his mind."
40626,c.j.,Leo's lost his mind.
40627,toby,Speaking in verse...
40628,c.j.,A literary curse.  Five minutes.
40629,josh,He doesn't have a Bible. Charlie's out looking for one.
40630,c.j.,Should I be...?
40631,josh,Charlie'll get it.
40632,c.j.,So there it is. Let's see what happens now.
40633,leo,"Listen. Will did a great a job, and I like him personally too. But he had a meeting with  that Public Affairs guy, and people at State are focusing a lot of displeasure on him."
40634,toby,I told him to have a bad meeting with that Public Affairs guy.
40635,leo,"I know, and I want to use him again, but I need friends at State right now, so I want  him to work under the radar. He should work out of his house and deal with us by phone."
40636,toby,That's exactly what I was going to say.
40637,leo,Yeah?
40638,toby,"Except the part about him working under the radar in his house on the phone. Leo, I  want the President to appoint him Deputy."
40639,leo,Are you sure?
40640,toby,I can talk to the people at State and--
40641,leo,I don't care about State. I'm asking... are you sure?
40642,toby,Yeah.
40643,leo,You don't mean on an interim basis?
40644,toby,No.
40645,leo,What about Sam?
40646,toby,"A promotion-- it's well past time. Make him a Senior Counselor, take the knucklehead  stuff off his desk, the way he did for me for four years. Let him concentrate on the  President and the country."
40647,leo,I'll advise the President.
40648,josh,Hey.
40649,josh,It wasn't your fault.
40650,josh,Donna?
40651,josh,She's sitting in her apartment in a ball gown.
40652,josh,She doesn't think it's appropriate for her to be here. I couldn't talk her down.
40653,josh,I tried hard.
40654,josh,It doesn't matter.
40655,josh,I haven't read it. Sorry. I haven't.
40656,josh,You're walking around with a copy of it? 
40657,josh,"Give me that.  Yeah, here it is. ""Said one White House  aide, 'We've got a situation--'"""
40658,josh,"""...'where the White House won't give the D.O.D an extra ten billion so they have to  go to the Hill and get it.' Said the same aide, ""Everybody's very loyal around here  unless you wear a uniform,'"" said the same aide. I hadn't read the first part of the  quote. Said the same aide? I'm going to kill her."
40659,toby," We're just going  to be a minute, right?"
40660,josh,Quick review.
40661,toby, Wait just one minute.
40662,josh,"It's good cop/bad cop. I'm the good cop; the four of you are the bad cop. Will, what  are you?"
40664,josh,Danny what are you?
40665,josh,"Toby, what are you?"
40666,toby,Hurry up.
40667,josh,"Charlie, who are you?"
40668,josh,"The bad cop, that's right. Here we go."
40670,toby, I'm standing here!
40671,josh, The buzzer's not working.
40672,toby,Did you try it?
40673,josh,"No, I divined it."
40674,josh,The buzzer's not working. There's a note that says the buzzer's not working.
40675,toby,Call her.
40676,josh,"No, I know women. I know what they're like.  Donna!"
40677,josh,Huh.
40678,toby,Yeah!
40679,josh,Here we go.
40681,josh,Get down here! Now!
40683,josh,Don't even think about telling me to keep my voice! Get down here!
40685,josh,"Oh, no, I'm sorry. Didn't mean to wake you guys. Uh, this is a special situation. It's  okay, I'm the good cop."
40686,toby," Hi, National Inquirer?"
40687,josh,You come down here without a coat?
40690,josh,"You don't know the White House rejected ten billion for the D.O.D. You have absolutely  no way of knowing that. Jack said it. The researcher called Jack, and Jack said it."
40692,josh,Yeah?
40694,josh,Donna--
40696,josh,He's letting you take credit for this?
40698,josh,Your career isn't important? What was the point of anyone claiming... You knew it was  easy... to figure out it was him.
40700,josh,"The list of things you didn't think about, including your job, what the President  thinks of you."
40702,josh,He's about to. You look amazing.
40704,toby,Donna.
40706,toby,Don't worry about it.
40707,josh," Hey, hey, hey. Good cop/bad cop."
40710,josh, We're going to a ball.
40712,josh,We're actually going to eight of them.
40714,josh,"I was actually the one who hit the window, the rest of them went to school on my throw."
40715,toby,Let's go!
40718,toby,This is what I've been telling you. Get in the car.
40720,josh,You're going to have to sit on somebody's lap.
40722,leo, Thank you.
40723,c.j.,You should expect increased voices of dissent after today - in breadth and depth.
40724,leo,"A ship in the harbor is safe, but that's not what ships were build for."
40725,c.j.,It's doubtful Danny's inquiries about Shareef would have gone further if he didn't have  new sources at the Pentagon.
40726,leo,So what?
40727,c.j.,Really?
40728,leo,You know what the decision directives say? That diplomats and leaders aren't immune  from being targets when they're connected to terrorist activities that threaten the  U.S. or its citizens. I don't think it's an unusual directive.
40729,c.j.,"That it was given hours before Shareef's plane disappeared... Just a reminder, the more  I know, the more I can help you. And don't be concerned with my exposure. I'm not your  daughter. I'm the White House Press Secretary."
40730,bartlet,Good evening.
40731,bartlet,Everything all right?
40732,toby,"Yes, sir."
40733,bartlet,"They're saying I'm rewriting the Constitution on the back of a napkin. They're saying  on FOX that a guy who couldn't run a local sheriff's department wants to send troops  around the world. They're saying it's liberalism with a grenade launcher. But they're  not saying it was badly written, so that's something. And they sure as hell know I was  serious, so that's something else. Congratulations, folks. We've got ourselves a doctrine. "
40734,bartlet,"Will, I think some of these people don't know who your dad is. Will's the youngest son  of Tom Bailey, who's the only guy in the world with a better title than mine. He was  Supreme Commander, NATO Allied Forces Europe. We didn't know we were going to do this.  I would have asked you to invite him."
40736,bartlet,"Actually, I meant he could be here now when I tell you Toby's asked me to commission  you as his deputy."
40738,bartlet,Toby wants to make you deputy.
40740,bartlet,I'm appointing you Deputy Communications Director. It covers a wide range of areas of  policy and execution and counsel to me.
40742,bartlet,Yes.
40744,leo,"Good God, boy."
40745,josh,"I remeber when you named me Deputy, there was a dull buzzing in my ear, or a humming.  It was very disorienting."
40746,c.j.,The same thing happened to me.
40747,josh,"Hang in there Will, you're doing fine."
40749,josh,What did I say about speaking to me without addressing me as Wild Thing.
40750,bartlet, Excuse me? 
40751,bartlet,Hi.  Sam's going to be promoted to Senior Counselor if  he loses the 47th.
40753,bartlet, That's what you want to hear from your new Communications--
40755,bartlet,There's a promise that I ask everyone who works here to make. Never doubt that a small  group of thoughtful and commited citizens can change the world. You know why?
40757,bartlet,"William Bailey, reposing special trust and confidence in your integrety, prudence and  ability, I designate you to the post of Deputy White House Director of Communications  and Special Assistant to the President. And I do authorize you to execute and fulfill  the duties of that office with all the powers and privileges and subject to the  conditions prescribed. It is affirmed by my signature... "
40758,bartlet,...and affixed with the Seal of of the Unites States. 
40759,bartlet,And it is done so on this day and in this place. 
40760,bartlet,Congratulations.
40761,bartlet," You know, it's easy to watch the news and think  of Khundunese as either hapless victims or crazed butchers, and it turns out that's not  true. I got this intelligence summary this afternoon. ""Mothers are standing in front of  tanks."" And we're going to go get their backs. An hour ago, I ordered Fitzwallace to  have UCOMM deploy a brigade of the 82nd Airborne, the 101st Air Assualt, and a Marine  Expeditionary Unit to Khundu to stop the violence. The 101st are the Screaming Eagles.  The Marines are with the 22nd M.E.U., trained at Camp Lejuene, some of them very recently.  I'm sorry, everyone, but this is a work night."
40762,leo,That's you too.
40764,bartlet,"I don't understand, did we just get put on call waiting or something?"
40765,bartlet,Wendall's answering the phones at U.S. European Commamnd?
40766,leo,Would you take it easy?
40767,bartlet,Is he placing a bet?
40768,bartlet,Thank you.
40769,leo,That was impressive.
40770,bartlet,Me?
40771,leo,"No, them. I meant..."
40772,bartlet,I get it.
40773,leo,I'm saying...
40774,bartlet,And I agree with you.
40775,leo,I'm not saying I don't think you can be impressive in the Situation Room.
40776,bartlet,I can tell by the way you laughed in my face at the suggestion that I was.
40777,leo,We changed wheels-up to 6:00 p.m.
40778,bartlet,I heard that. Why?
40779,leo,D-triple-C put an event in Brentwood.
40780,bartlet,I've told him over and over about money and endorsements from outside the district.  Why is he going to Brentwood?
40781,leo,For the same reason Willy Sutton robbed banks.
40782,bartlet,What does Joey say?
40783,leo,"He's anywhere from five to eight points down, favorabilty below 50. They're making it  about values."
40784,bartlet,"The right to privacy's a value, so is clean air."
40785,leo,That argument's been incredibly effective in the past.
40786,leo,"They want a few more hours for the revenue calculations, but they're saying it's  definitely going to be today."
40787,bartlet,"Deficit-nuetral, we've had 14 meetings."
40788,leo,"They understand. Ways and Means Democrats, then the NEC breifing on scoring."
40789,bartlet,What's wrong with booze and a comfortable pickup? Scoring.
40790,leo,"I know what you were saying. What, are you from the Ozarks?"
40791,bartlet,"Is there going to be a democrat tax plan, or am I going to be stuck in NEC scoring  hell for the rest of my term?"
40792,leo,You got a meeting on salmon runs in Oregon at 3:00.
40793,bartlet,What do salmon runs have to do with it?
40794,leo,"Nothing, sir. It doesn't have anything to do with the tax plan. I was moving on."
40795,bartlet,Last week it was a banana embargo. Is Congress opening a restaurant?
40796,leo,There's no reason you can't relax a little bit in California.
40797,bartlet,Aren't there quite a few reasons?
40798,leo,Yes.
40799,bartlet,Miss Humentashen.
40800,bartlet,Leo said just now that there was going to be an NEC briefing on scoring and tell her  what I said.
40801,leo,"""What's wrong with booze and a comfortable pickup?"""
40802,bartlet,No there's not.
40803,bartlet,"Mr. Ambassador, I'm sorry to keep you waiting. I was just in the White House Situation Room."
40804,bartlet,"I've just taken your airport...  ...clearing the way for the 101st Air  Assualt to take the capitol. 7,000 troops, 25 battle tanks, 15 Apache attack helicopters,  and three destroyers. Strictly speaking, I conquered your country without the paperwork."
40805,bartlet,"No, it's not. It's in the midst of a one-sided slaughtering of an entire people. Both  the Secretary General of the United Nations and the Vatican have pleaded with President  Nzele for a cease-fire and both the U.N. and the Holy Father have struck out to the peril  of 115,000 Induye men, women, and God knows children, particularly the boys."
40806,bartlet,"The heads of Ghana, Nigeria and Zaire have similairly sent packing. The Red Cross has been  denied entry on three seperate occasions in the last ten says. President Nzele has 36 hours  to give the command to his troops to hand over their weapons to the 82nd Divison Airborne  Division of the United States Army. At 36 hours and one minute, I give the order for the  101st Air Assualt to take Bitanga and run up our flag. I skipped breakfast. Anybody want  coffee or something?"
40807,c.j.,The President informed both Ambassador Tiki and President Nzele that they have 36-- now  34 and a half hours-- to implement a halt to the violence before U.S. forces deploy. John.
40808,c.j.,You've got a Pentagon briefing at noon. Katie.
40809,c.j.,"The government of Ghana as offered to act as an intermediary, and those talks begin  within the hour."
40810,c.j.,Safe Haven.
40811,c.j.,Always be upbeat.
40812,c.j.,"Yeah, I don't get to decide press policy for the U.S. Armed Forces, though if wishing  made it so, but we're bring Pentagon Public Affairs on the California trip and we'll  be meeting about it all weekend. Tonights forecast for D.C. is 18 degrees of Mercury.  For Newport Beach, it's 78 and sunny."
40813,c.j.,Even at night.
40814,c.j.,"Well, Sam's going to meet us and we're going to get something to eat."
40815,c.j.,"Don't be fooled. They love us in Orange County. They're crazy-go-nuts for the President.  They're really the Democratic party in general. I think they really like it when we come  to town. When we were there last month, we we're working the crowd, and some boys,  worried possibly that I couldn't afford fruits and vegetables on a government salary,  tossed me some of their own. "
40816,c.j.,"78 and sunny. Yeah, we're going to have a dabba-doo time, so unless there are any  updates, I'll see you on the plane."
40817,c.j.," I've got $1,331 in my checking account. I'll write you a check for $1,300  if you go to California instead of me. Just leave me $31 for food and transportation."
40818,c.j.,"That, by the way, was a sky-blue DKNY suit worn for 41 minutes. There should be a law  against that."
40819,c.j.,Who was she bumped for?
40820,c.j.,Okay.
40821,c.j.,For who?
40822,c.j.,"All right, let's see if we can get Gretchen in front of the Times and..."
40823,c.j.,Wait a second. Rittenhouse and Gacey?
40824,c.j.,It's the tax plan. Josh!
40825,c.j., We need to  see the President.
40826,bartlet,"Right. On the other hand, 20% of your youth is unemployed. They're just living to live."
40827,bartlet,"Yeah, it helps when someone else is picking up the bigger ticket items like a national  defense."
40828,bartlet,I'm sorry?
40829,bartlet,Excellent.
40830,bartlet,"Yes, absolutely, send them in."
40831,bartlet,"Yeah, whatever, hang on a second.  What do you need?"
40832,josh,"Sir, we didn't know you were busy; we'll wait outside."
40833,bartlet,"No, that's all right. What do you need?"
40834,josh,The three of you should bond.
40835,bartlet,Come here. 
40836,bartlet,"If you leave, I'll kill you."
40837,josh,"Yes, sir."
40838,bartlet,"I'm sorry, Jean-Paul, I'll have to cut it short. Josh has gotten himself in a jam. But  I'll see you on the plane tonight, and I'll look forward to continue the discussion on,  you know, what's wrong with me."
40839,bartlet,What?
40840,c.j.,The chair of House Ways and Means and Senate Finance are doing the Sunday shows.
40841,bartlet,You think the Republicans are rolling out their tax plan?
40842,c.j.,I do.
40843,bartlet,Thank God.
40844,c.j.,Why?
40845,bartlet,'Cause we can roll out ours and I don't have to sit through another seven scoring meetings.
40846,josh,But it means they're going to announce their tax plan this afternoon or this evening.  That's tomorrow and Sunday before we respond.
40847,bartlet,"Why not respond Saturday or Sunday? Better yet, let's go first. Call the press in, and  I'll do it right now."
40848,josh,It's not ready yet. It's still being scored.
40849,bartlet,Toby?
40850,toby,I don't like that French kid very much.
40851,bartlet,It'll be ready tomorrow?
40852,toby,Yes.
40853,bartlet,"I say we respond to theirs with ours, but we do it tomorrow or Sunday."
40854,toby,You'd be announcing a one-percent tax increase on the richest one percent and doing it  in Orange County.
40855,bartlet,Then that's where we do it.
40857,josh,Which is why I think we should cancel the trip.
40858,bartlet,And announce from the White House.
40859,josh,"Yes, sir."
40860,c.j.,Won't the White House canceling the trip be taken as a signal that we've given up on  the 47th?
40862,c.j.,And do equal damage to the campaign?
40864,josh,You want to go to Orange County?
40865,c.j.,"I think we have to go.  Even though there's $1,300 with your name on it if  you don't make me go with you."
40866,toby,"Get over the dress, would you?"
40867,c.j.,It was a suit and they hit me with an avocado.
40868,toby,It could've been worse.
40869,c.j.,How?
40870,toby,They could have hit me.
40871,c.j.,"Sir, the first 24 hours of the cycle are critical. We can't fight something with nothing  and that's what we'll have for 48 hours after they announce if we don't announce too."
40872,bartlet,That's a killer decision. But let's lean towards Sam and say we keep our mouths shut in  California and then come out fighting Monday morning.
40873,josh,"Thank you, Mr. President."
40874,toby,Will?
40876,toby,Every speech the President gives on Tuesday has to be about the Democratic tax plan.  How many public remarks is he making on Tuesday?
40878,toby,Plus we need speech inserts for the Cabinet.
40880,toby,"Yes, you can, because you're going to use the staff to help you."
40882,toby,"Your staff-- the White House speechwriting staff. Your staff. You will tell them what you  need. You will expect it. You will tell them how they can do better, and they will do it."
40884,toby,Yes.
40886,toby,Yes.
40888,toby,But in reality?
40890,toby,"No, no, no, they don't like you at all."
40892,toby,"Don't know; more to the point, I don't care."
40894,toby,"They've been working for the President forever. You've been here three minutes, and  he made you a deputy. They have whiplash."
40896,toby,And I'm surprised they haven't come around yet.
40898,toby,Listen to me. Many of these are the lowest possible priority remarks. There are more  valuable places for your time. Now instruct your staff.
40905,sam, Hello?
40907,sam,How you doing?
40909,sam,Scott thought we should be at the Manufacturing Association breakfast.
40911,sam," Hey, Scott, Will says he doesn't think you're very smart."
40913,sam,What do you need?
40915,sam,Really?
40917,sam,"I don't know, but when you do, why don't you tell me how you did it?"
40919,sam,You're going to have some new staffers in there.
40921,sam,What's going on Monday?
40923,sam, Got to go.
40925,sam, He was wondering why we canceled the Teamsters.
40926,sam,I'm going to need to work hard to avoid that appearance?
40927,sam,"Well, let me ask you, what do we have planned that might be mistaken..."
40928,sam,Did you not think I knew what he meant?
40929,sam,"Well, I have a good feeling about this trip already."
40930,toby,I'm going to go with him.
40932,toby,We though it was going to be...
40933,toby,That's what I thought we were talking about. I didn't even realize the 15%.
40934,toby,"Oh, my God. Have you been on the plane the whole time?"
40935,toby,What are you doing here?
40936,toby,And I told you you couldn't fly.
40937,toby,"Listen to me. We've got all kinds of atmospheric cabin pressure up here. We're a little  late, so the Colonel's put the hammer down in a 747. You've got windshear, downdraft,  massive turbulence, not to mention four giant engines burning jet fuel at galactic  temperatures. We're standing in a flying death tube! "
40938,toby,"No, not the rest of y-you. It's just my family. It's, it's fine.  Look..."
40939,toby,"Also, you've got twins in there. You're basically a minivan. How are you fitting into  a seat?"
40941,josh,Yeah?
40943,josh,Say that again.
40945,josh,I don't know. I don't know him. Find out if he's for real before I meet with him.
40947,josh,You meet with him.
40949,josh,"Well, to begin with, is he wearing shoes and shirt?"
40951,josh,"Ask him what he thinks of Richard Sutter. He's an Assemblyman who proposed the Foreign  Labor... It doesn't matter. If he doesn't have a strong opinion on Sutter, he doesn't  play at your level."
40953,josh,"You do. It's not a lot to speak of, but you know, no shoes no shirt, I'm sorry, but  you draw the line."
40955,josh,An Assemblyman.
40956,c.j.,We've begun spreading our magic already.
40957,josh,What happened?
40958,c.j.,Some wires got crossed between the Advance and Airlift Operations and CHP on the ground. They didn't get the word until late that take-off had been delayed and they also thought  we were coming into SNA and not Los Alamitos.
40959,josh,The result being?
40960,c.j.,Interstate 5 has been shut down for an hour and a half.
40961,josh,Is that a freeway that gets used a lot?
40962,c.j.,"Not for the last hour and a half, no."
40963,josh,"All right, has the President seen any of the news on the Republican tax cut?"
40964,bartlet,No response from the White House?
40965,bartlet, There's my response.
40966,bartlet," Sing it, Larry."
40967,bartlet,15% cut across the board? Cutting capital gains 50%!
40968,toby,And they said it would cost $800 billion.
40969,bartlet,And it's actually going to cost?
40970,josh,$1.2 trillion.
40971,bartlet,"I'm not an economist, but no... Wait, I am an economist. So, their plan will do what, C.J.?"
40972,c.j.,Explode...
40973,bartlet,"Explode the deficit. Will it stimulate the economy, Josh?"
40974,josh,It will stimulate the Swiss economy.
40975,bartlet,"Josh gets extra credit for being funny and right at the same time, and how long do I have  to stay quiet, Toby?"
40976,toby,"You're the leader of the free world, sir. You can speak anytime you like."
40977,bartlet,And not kill Sam?
40978,toby,"No, for that you got to shut up for 50 hours."
40979,bartlet,And so I shall.
40994,leo,He's not in...
40995,leo,He's not in a position to be demanding anything.
40996,leo,And?
40997,leo,No.
40998,leo,Our stomach for it?
40999,leo,"Thomas, Robbie-- you've got to find a way of getting word to Nzele that in 23 hours  he's going to lose that bet."
41013,toby,74 degrees in February. There's no civilization here.
41015,toby,Hmm?
41017,toby,"Yeah, I fired some of them."
41019,toby,All of them.
41021,toby,"I was thinking about what you said this morning, and I think they have a bad attitude.  Also, they're pretty bad at their jobs."
41023,toby,Just as soon as you hire them.
41025,toby,You can't.
41027,toby,You can't. That's why I left you a staff.
41029,toby,"Tell them what you want, and then expect it."
41031,toby,They're bright young women. Show some leadership skills. Get it done. We're here.  I'll call you in a little bit.
41033,toby,Yeah.
41035,toby,Yeah.
41038,c.j.,I'm sorry.
41039,sam,Don't worry about it. 
41040,c.j.,Hi.
41041,sam,Toby!
41042,toby,Sorry about that.
41043,sam,Don't worry about it.
41044,c.j.,Did we do much damage?
41045,sam,"They got a photograph of an American SUV with three kids in the back crying 'cause they  were stuck getting home from Disney's California Adventure. Listen, I feel bad you made  the trip now. Who knew the Republicans were going to announce? Plus, he's got to be  distracted by Kuhndu."
41046,c.j.,He's fine. 
41047,c.j.,Mr. President?
41048,bartlet,"Man, I'm sorry about this. "
41049,sam,Thank you for coming. I was just saying you must be distracted by Kuhndu.
41050,bartlet,"The French have denied us access to their airspace. I'm not sure why they think we're  going to need it to get from here to Africa, but what the hell. This weekend's all  about you. Get up there."
41051,bartlet,This is going to be about France. Did we accidently trap people in a theme park?
41052,bartlet, Yeah?
41053,sam,Thank you very much. Thank you. You've heard from a lot of people tonight and many of  them were me. I'm happy to see that so many teachers here tonight brought students.  The man that I worked for is not only a great President; he's an extraordinary role  model. And someone you can honestly...
41054,sam,"Ladies and gentlemen, the President of the United States."
41068,toby,It's me.
41070,toby,We got off to a rough start.
41072,toby,Don't worry about the campaign.
41074,toby,Don't worry about it. How are the remarks coming?
41077,c.j.,"Well, there are some nice shots of you and the President, but the one you're going to  see a lot of is you kissing a liberal, pregnant, unwed congresswoman."
41078,sam,Yeah.
41079,toby,Kissing her where?
41080,josh,The Journal's attacking him for campaigning at the same time he's sending troops overseas.
41081,sam,"What the Register and Daily Pilot term ""insulting remarks"" at the school have made their  special pull-out section."
41082,toby,They minded he insulted the French?
41083,c.j.,"Or ""poncy hairdressers,"" it's not clear..."
41084,sam,"Yeah, but he also mentioned vouchers, closing the 5, 405 and the 55 didn't play well.  And because he was late he couldn't see off a battalion leaving from Miramar, flights  out of John Wayne were held on the ground and of course, children crying at the ""Pirates  of the Carribean,"" and it's still 6:30 in the morning."
41085,c.j.,"So, you'd rate the trip so far, what, B, B-minus? C-minus? We'll get it together."
41086,sam,"I have no idea what makes me say this, but it's good to see you. I have a strategy  breakfast."
41087,josh,You want me to come?
41088,sam,That's okay.
41089,toby,"Let him come, Sam."
41090,sam,"Yeah, well, you know, the thing is Scott Holcomb and Josh."
41091,josh,"Oh, come on."
41092,c.j.,"I think Holcomb's been making bad mistakes with you, Sam. I think Josh's been right."
41093,toby,I know Josh has been right and if you think that's easy for me to say...
41094,josh,He's got you with business.
41095,sam,He says it's how a Democrat wins Orange County.
41096,josh,Has a Democrat ever won Orange County?
41097,sam,No.
41098,josh,Then how would he know?
41099,sam,"That's a fair point, but it's who the national committee wants running the campaign,  and that's where money's coming from so I have a strategy breakfast and I'll see you  all a little bit later."
41100,josh,"I wasn't trying to get under his skin. On the other hand, I didn't really care that  I had, you know what I mean?"
41101,sam,Yeah.
41102,josh,"Some polls that have you within seven. If you only lost by seven, that would be huge, man."
41103,sam,I don't want to think like that yet.
41104,josh,Good. 
41105,josh,"Okay, where are we?"
41115,sam,Donna!
41117,sam," Hey, everyone, this is one of my best friends. This is  Donna Moss. "
41118,sam,I didn't get the chance to see you much last night. How are you doing?
41120,sam,Don't worry about it. Where are you coming from?
41122,sam,Is he?
41124,sam, Anyone ever heard of Ivan Perez?
41127,sam,Donna just met with him.
41128,sam,What party?
41132,sam,"Take it easy. Donna, did anybody see you having coffee?"
41134,sam,Who?
41136,sam, Hey! Out of here. You're fired.
41137,sam,I don't care. He's out of here.
41138,sam,Like I'm not used to that.
41140,leo,"Hey, how's it going down there?"
41142,leo,I heard your staff quit.
41144,leo,Because we promoted you to deputy?
41146,leo,"Well, that's a little small."
41148,leo,On Saturday?
41150,leo,"Not ordinarily, but a lot of people made the California trip, the Treasury Secretary's  staff is in the Midwest."
41152,leo,For me?
41154,leo,You are.
41156,leo,I hope not.
41157,leo,When was the last flyover?
41158,leo,Are we seeing any pictures of the Arkutu getting ready to surrender?
41159,leo,How many more in the next 20 hours?
41160,leo,So why not talk about blowing off the deadline?
41161,leo,He's trying to finish the job before the deadline.
41162,c.j.,Sure. He's getting continuous updates. He's also spoken by phone today with the UN  Secretary-General and the leadership of the World Bank and the IMF to begin discussing  rebuilding packages after the Arkutu stepdown.
41163,c.j.,He'll have a conference call with his economics team.
41164,c.j.,"The tax plan isn't a response to the Republicans, it's a tax plan, and yes."
41165,c.j.,A series of meetings upstairs in his suite. The California leadership of the FOP the  Governor and the State Assembly Leadership on matching payments before he goes on to  the fund-rasier.
41166,c.j.,Was a White House aide sent to meet with the Communist Party's candidate for governor?
41167,c.j.,"No, Donna Moss was sent to meet with the head of the California Agricultural Laborers  Association, a man named Ivan Perez, who, it turns out has some loose ties to the  American Communist Party."
41168,c.j.,"Like that one. Mr. Perez was heard, as he certainly has a right to be, and that's that."
41169,c.j.,"Really, really well. I'll talk to you before the dinner. Thank you."
41176,toby, How's it going?
41178,toby,Did I tell you to worry about the speeches or did I tell you to worry about Sam's campaign?
41180,toby,Read me what you've got for the swearing in of the Ambassador.
41182,toby,"Okay, you're going to polish that up?"
41184,c.j., You and Josh need to take over the campaign.
41185,toby,We've asked.
41186,c.j.,Just for the last week.
41187,toby,"We've asked. We said we'd go off the White House payroll. I've had to bungee Will to  his desk. Until higher authorities steps in, the DNC wants Holcomb."
41188,c.j.,When they have him in community centers at a podium...
41189,toby,I know.
41190,c.j.,...it looks like he's wearing his dad's old suit. He's got youth and vitality. He should...
41191,toby,I know.
41193,toby,Tell me about it.
41194,c.j.,"Sir, you are way out of line, and we're having a private conversation, but thank you..."
41195,toby,"Okay, sir, you're standing too close now."
41196,toby,"Yeah, it's the father and you're standing too close, so, if you're going to insist on  being drunk and minding other people's business, you've got to take a step back, 'cause  as you are apparently aware, the Congresswoman is pregnant."
41197,leo,"He's killed 115,000 people and he wants to stay in power, get immunity and cash a check  for half a billion dollars?"
41198,leo,Yeah?
41199,leo, Get me Fitzwallace and then get me the President.
41200,toby," Excuse me, Officer, ballpark-- How long  do you think this is going to be?"
41201,toby, Tell him he's got to hit hard on quality-- health care quality-- and in  his acknowledgements he's got to...
41202,toby," In his acknowledgements, he's got to mention the  AFL folk. The President's working the..."
41203,toby,The President's working the rope line for 15...
41204,toby,No. Charlie says no on the rope line.
41205,toby,"And if you can call the NEC and get a one-pager on trucking faxed to me in my cell,  I'd really..."
41206,toby,Okay. I got to go. I'm under arrest. 
41207,toby,Does he ever know the names of the people's he's meeting?
41208,toby,Is there any chance I could get a corner cell or anything possibly with a loft?
41209,toby,Perfect.
41210,sam,I got salsa on my shirt.
41211,sam,"Yeah, they got it."
41212,sam,What's going on?
41213,sam,I like bold.
41214,sam,Tax deductible tuition.
41215,sam,Why?
41216,sam,I worked on it.
41217,sam,Tax deductible tuition. I worked on it.
41218,sam,"Yeah, and the President was also doing what I helped advise him to do."
41219,sam,Wait a second. They're announcing on Monday?
41220,sam,How do you know?
41221,sam,"And it's been scored, fully scored?"
41222,sam,"Well, why the hell would...? Excuse me."
41223,bartlet,Mrs. Hottentot?
41224,bartlet,"Yeah, where are they?"
41225,bartlet,What do you mean?
41226,bartlet,They're under arrest?
41227,bartlet,Did they rob the bar?
41228,bartlet,Uh-huh. And what did Charlie do?
41229,josh,Sir.
41230,bartlet,Toby and Charlie were arrested in a bar fight.
41231,josh,"Yes, sir, it's not going to be a problem. C.J.'s taking care of it."
41232,bartlet,Really?
41233,josh,It's going to be a little bit of a problem.
41234,bartlet,Everytime we come to Southern California we are absolutely the Clampetts.
41235,josh,He booked him at the Newport Beach Chamber of Commerce. He had him skip a union lunch  without telling restaurant employees...
41236,bartlet,I came...
41237,josh,"He wants him speaking at Cal Lutheran. Scott Holcomb's given up on Sam, and he's running  his own agenda. Now, I can't leave with the tax proposal coming out, but Toby says he  can for a week. Evidently, Will's put together a top-flight staff that can handle the  paper for a week. And I suppose it's worth mentioning that Toby probably can't leave the  state anyway. Now, as the leader of this party you..."
41238,bartlet,You really don't want to shake up a campaign like this at this point in the election  calendar.
41239,josh,"At this point in the election calendar look which way his numbers are going. I'm amazed  he's kept a veneer of sanity, much less..."
41240,sam,Are you crazy?!
41241,josh,We were just...
41242,sam,Have you all lost your minds?
41243,josh,"Well, C.J. maybe."
41244,sam,"I just assumed that it wasn't ready yet. It's ready now, isn't it?"
41245,josh,Yeah.
41246,sam,"You are missing news cycle after news cycle after news cycle, but you didn't announce  'cause you didn't want to do it from Orange County."
41247,josh,Would you?
41248,sam,"Yes! I say to hell with the election! There's a guy in St. Louis making $55,000 a year  trying to send his kid to Notre Dame!"
41249,bartlet,"Guys, we've got to keep our voices down a little."
41250,sam,"If I'm going to lose, I'd like to lose doing something."
41251,sam,"Thank you. Thank you very much. The President of the United States is backstage.  He'll be out here in a minute. He'll be out here in a minute because, of course, he's  monitoring our troops in Kuhndu. But I wanted to say that yesterday the Republicans  rolled out their tax plan. Do not let this President off this stage until he's told  you his. Send me to Congress, and mine will be the first yea vote cast."
41252,bartlet,Scott...
41253,bartlet,Why are you putting Sam next to business?
41254,bartlet,"No, I'm just curious."
41255,bartlet,Josh...
41256,josh,"Yes, sir."
41257,bartlet,Tell Toby to take over the campaign.
41258,bartlet,"Yeah.  Leo, I just fired Scott Holcomb. Toby, who, with Charlie, is meeting  with a bails bondsman right now, has to come off the payroll for a week."
41259,leo,"Sir, I'm afraid something has happened."
41260,bartlet,What?
41261,leo,Two Marine Lance Corporals and a PFC have been taken.
41262,bartlet,What do you mean they've been taken?
41263,leo,"Patrolling Bitanga airport in a humvee, 50 guys came out of nowhere."
41264,bartlet,We secured the airport.
41265,leo,They came out of nowhere.
41266,bartlet,What are we doing?
41267,leo,Special Ops wants to brief you on some rescue scenarios.
41268,bartlet,We're coming home.
41269,leo,Nzele says for immunity and $500 million he'll keep them alive.
41270,bartlet,Tell Ghana to tell Nzele he's got 9 hours and 20 minutes before I take him.
41271,leo,"Yes, sir."
41272,bartlet,Thanks.
41273,bartlet,Lieutenant.
41274,bartlet,How old are you?
41275,sam,"And so, friends, the President of the United States."
41276,bartlet,Let's go.
41277,toby," Well, Sam's on his way over, and I'll tell you something, if I was  someone who felt comfortable hugging other people, I'd give one to Sam 'cause he  absolutely impaled himself. So I think the least I can do is bring the Ziegler brand  of wisdom to the campaign for the last week, be a role model. By the way, you know  what they don't tell you? You can post bond with a credit card."
41278,toby, Yeah. Charlie's trying to throw down with the street. It's kind of a  sad sight to see.
41279,toby, Hang on.
41280,toby," Yeah. Uh, uh, when do you land?"
41281,toby," Excuse me, I think they're making me buy somebody's house. Uh, call me  when you land."
41282,toby,"I'm sorry, I can't remember who I borrowed this from."
41283,toby,Thanks.
41284,sam,Toby...
41285,toby,I'm sorry I missed your rally. That was a hell of a thing you did with the tax plan.
41286,sam,Thank you.
41287,toby,I meant it was really stupid.
41288,sam,"Speaking of which, what happened?"
41289,toby,With us?
41290,sam,Yes.
41291,toby,At the bar?
41292,sam,Yes.
41293,toby,"Couple of country club guys were a little lubed. They got into it with Andy. I wanted  them to step back, and he slipped, and his wingman thought I hit him, so he came for me,  and I took care of business."
41294,toby,Charlie took care of business.
41295,sam, You're all right?
41296,toby,"Hurricane, we were in the joint for two hours and 20 minutes, 'kay?"
41297,sam,"Look, you probably haven't had a chance to talk to anybody."
41298,toby,"No, I just got off with Josh, and I'm running the campaign for the last week."
41299,sam,"Yeah. Technically, the President can't fire Scott Holcomb."
41300,toby,"He was taking it in the wrong direction, Sam, and you know it."
41301,sam,And you guys are going to take it in the right direction?
41302,toby,"We made a rough entrance here, but things are looking up now."
41303,sam,"You trapped people at Disneyland, told the French they could stick a loaf of bread up  their ass, had a meeting with a Communist, and things are looking up 'cause my new  campaign director just made bail."
41304,toby,"Look, a glass is half full or half... You know, the other thing..."
41305,sam,How'd you call Josh?
41306,toby,What do you mean?
41307,sam,Didn't they take your cellphone from you?
41308,toby,I borrowed theirs. 
41309,sam,"So on a call girl's phone bill, there's going to be a call to Air Force One?"
41310,toby,You're really going to be teaching the seminar on call girl caution? Really?
41311,sam,What are we doing about this story?
41312,toby,Nothing. It's a box on page 27.
41313,sam,"Oh, I think it's going to be more than that."
41314,toby,"They got the hostages, the President heading to Washington, a flood in Colorado and a  chemical fire in Providence. We got saved."
41315,toby,"All right, I called that putt too early."
41316,bartlet,"How come it's never people with six months to live who are taken hostage? I mean there's  so much of it, you'd think once in a while we'd catch a break."
41317,josh," Hey, Trotsky."
41319,josh,The First Lady's going to fly out to California tomorrow and do the President's public  events. Would you let C.J. know that she should stay? She was going to take a red-eye back.
41321,josh,"Also, Charlie should stay and staff the First Lady."
41323,josh,"Yeah, Max is taken care of."
41325,josh,"Well, I guess I'm really suppose to do it myself."
41327,josh,"You took a meeting with a Communist, Donna."
41329,josh,Yeah. Fair enough. My bad.
41331,josh,"Yes, please."
41332,bartlet,Yeah.
41333,bartlet,Would you all excuse me?
41334,bartlet, Yeah?
41335,leo,Electronic eavesdropping and a couple of paid informants lead us to believe they're being  held in a barracks about 37 miles east of Bitanga.
41336,bartlet,"What happens if, screw the deadline, we just go to full deployment right now?"
41337,leo,"Well, I don't know, but the three Marines would certainly be executed."
41338,bartlet,"All right, we got to go get them."
41339,leo,Fitz.
41340,bartlet,"All right, then, on my order."
41341,leo,"Thank you, Mr. President."
41361,toby,It made the news out there?
41363,toby,"The President's coming out with his tax plan tomorrow, not Monday."
41365,toby,"Sam found out we were holding back 'cause of his campaign, and made the President flip  the cards a couple of hours ago, so the toothpaste's out of the tube, and we're going  to need to be ready with public remarks by the end of the day tomorrow."
41368,toby,Are you there?
41370,toby,I'll call you in an hour.
41371,toby,"No, actually you're not. The First Lady's flying in tomorrow and taking over the  President's events, so she needs to be staffed."
41372,toby,Advance is bringing it over to you.
41373,toby,"Yeah, she's still here."
41374,toby,"All right, Amy, how much money does he have left?"
41375,toby,Yet with regard to money you remain...?
41376,toby,Because?
41377,toby,Will they write checks this late?
41378,sam,I'm enjoying this.
41379,toby,"You're eight points down with ten points up for grabs, and you need them all to break  for you."
41380,sam,All of them?
41381,toby,"Yes. Well, look, it's been one of those days. Who would've thought Charlie could bust  us out of the Newport Beach Correctional Facility using nothing but his shoes. Go ahead,  tell them, Charlie."
41382,toby,No.
41383,josh,I think 80 million... 
41384,josh,"Yeah, I think 80 million is pretty unrealistic from the House. Didn't-- last year--  didn't the conferees split the differnce, like 68-something?"
41385,josh,"All right, we'll tell them the budget submission's at 80, and everyone's happy at 70.  Do we have anything else?"
41386,josh,"Max, there's no more 12 million."
41387,josh,I traded.
41388,josh,I am not.
41389,josh,You get a daily memo on Hill consultations.
41390,josh,Yes. Thank you.
41391,josh,"Well, I'd have someone else do it, but it's up to you."
41403,josh,"You're very stealthy, ma'am. I've always liked that about you."
41405,josh,How are you this morning?
41407,josh,"I haven mentioned this in a while, ma'am, but I think you and the President are a  perfect couple."
41409,josh,"Me, too, but at the end of a prize fight, you look at the guy who's dancing around,  and that's who won."
41411,josh,"Well, can I ask you, ma'am, why do you think?"
41413,josh,Wrong.
41415,josh,"Wrong, ma'am."
41417,josh,The President and Leo make their decisions by listening to and participating in vigorous  debate. This isn't school. I work with people who can play.
41419,josh,"Yes, ma'am."
41421,josh,Because I won-- I always do-- and you came here for my advice.
41423,josh,Max is an idiot.
41425,josh,"No kidding. He doesn't understand the budget process, he doesn't understand committee  structure, he thinks decisions are made in meetings..."
41427,josh,"...and he can't play at this level. Mrs. Bartlet, you're the First Lady, you need a Chief  of Staff, a real one. If you want your agenda taken seriously, put a professional face on it."
41429,josh,"Thank you, ma'am."
41430,toby,"When they ask you why you're here today, you say, ""Orange County's beachfront is national  treasure."""
41431,sam,"Who are you, Charlie McCarthy?"
41432,toby,"Charlie McCarthy was the dummy. Edgar Bergen was the ventriloquist. When they ask you  about the rise in the Consumer Price Index, you say, ""Orange County's beachfront is a  national treasure."""
41433,sam,They're going to ask me about the Democratic tax plan.
41434,toby,They might.
41435,sam,They might?
41436,toby,They will.
41437,sam,Yeah.
41438,toby,"And when they do, here's what you say: ""Orange County's beachfront is a national treasure."""
41439,sam,"Assuming I did say that, which there's no chance I'm going to, you don't think I'd sound  like an idiot?"
41440,toby,"I doubt you'll sound like anything. They'll just use it b-roll. But on the off-chance  there's audio, you might as well be on message."
41441,toby, Sam will take some questions now.
41442,sam,"Well, Orange County's beachfront are a national treasure, Samantha. And that's why I  support creating the Federal Beach Project..."
41443,c.j.,He looks youthful.
41444,toby,Yes.
41445,c.j.,And energetic.
41446,toby,Yes.
41447,c.j.,He looks youthful and energetic. Do we have anything he can jump over?
41448,toby,What do you want?
41449,c.j.,What's going on at the White House?
41450,toby,"I'm standing right here, I don't have special powers of... When you brief the press,  that's when I'll know."
41451,c.j.,"You've never been on a beach in your life, have you?"
41452,toby,No.
41453,bartlet,They're here?
41454,bartlet,Who are they?
41455,bartlet,Is the three-year-old in there?
41456,bartlet,This is my first time doing this particular one.
41457,bartlet,"Good morning, I'm Jed Bartlet. Mr. and Mrs. Hernandez?"
41458,bartlet,Mrs. Rowe?
41459,bartlet,"Mrs. Halley, is it all right if I call you Diane?"
41460,bartlet,Are you Betty?
41461,bartlet,Are you three years old?
41462,bartlet,Are you scared now?
41463,bartlet,"Don't be. Diane, do you mind if Betty sat in the next room with my secretary, Ms. Fiderer?"
41464,bartlet, Please. Mm-hmm.
41465,bartlet,Yeah. It was taken off of Kundunese TV.
41466,bartlet,"Yeah, sure."
41467,bartlet,"I'm afraid so, sir, yes. We're currently negotiating for Red Cross access so they can  get medical attention."
41468,bartlet,"I'm sorry, I can't tell you that."
41469,bartlet,"I'm sorry, I can't tell you that either."
41470,bartlet,"Mr. Hernandez, I can only imagine..."
41471,bartlet,"No, ma'am, I can't."
41472,leo,Excuse me.
41473,bartlet,"Excuse me, please."
41474,leo,Delta just got it right in Ghana.
41475,bartlet,Let's go.
41476,leo,What about resistance?
41477,leo,What's the timetable?
41478,bartlet,Why a wet team?
41479,bartlet,Why the CIA wet team? We're not near water.
41480,bartlet,I had to ask. What's it called?
41481,bartlet,Go.
41516,leo,I'm sorry?
41517,leo,"I'm sorry, Mrs. Rowe, I still don't follow..."
41518,leo,"I'm sorry, I'm still not... I can tell you if it's just a matter of..  When the U.S. is involved in a military conflict anywhere in the world,  the chief of staff is given increased security. It's just.. is that what you meant?"
41519,leo,I did. I flew F-105's for the 355th Tactical Fighter Wing.
41520,leo,Yeah. The war in Vietnam.
41521,leo,That's alright.
41522,leo,You should call me Leo.
41523,leo,"Steve, you wanna ask me if your son's being tortured."
41524,leo,I can't tell you that.
41525,leo,Excuse me.
41526,leo,"Well, let's get everybody in."
41528,josh,What does she say?
41530,josh,Read it to me.
41532,josh,Yep.
41533,josh,Yep.
41534,josh,"Yeah. Wait, what?"
41535,josh,Did you say immunization education?
41536,josh,I didn't move anything.
41537,josh,Let me see this.
41538,josh,This isn't what we had this morning.
41539,josh, I don't know. Did I proofread it?
41541,josh,..to make sure it reflected the changes we agreed to? I didn't do that.
41543,josh, Who moved the money?
41544,josh,Whoever moved the money knows that I don't proofread these things.
41545,josh,Max doesn't know anything.
41546,josh," Boy, really leaving no stone unturned, aren't ya?"
41548,josh, Read me the rest of the fax.
41550,josh,How did she... Read me the fax. 
41553,josh,Yeah.
41554,toby,"You know, I think I've got..yes, yes I do, I've still got sand in my shoes from like six  hours ago."
41555,c.j., Sand in my shoes...
41556,c.j., ..sand from Havana...
41557,toby,"You know, I'm looking at this wire report. Why's the First Lady commenting on falling  soybean prices?"
41558,c.j., That's what they were asking her?
41559,toby,Why'd you let her take the questions?
41560,c.j.,"In retrospect, that's what a lot of us are wondering. "
41561,c.j.,I don't think that's a good idea.
41562,toby,Why not?
41563,c.j.," 'Cause it's a black tie event. And when she talks about poor  women wearing a $4000 Mercritia dress, she looks like Marie Antoinette."
41564,toby,She's right.
41565,c.j.,"I am. So, you should tell her that, Charlie."
41566,c.j.,You should tell her not to talk about the House vote.
41567,c.j.,I once had to tell the President he was wearing two different shoes.
41568,sam, You polished up my remarks?
41569,toby,Those are recommendations.
41570,sam,For the office park?
41571,toby,They're recommendations. Say what you want.
41572,sam,"I'm asking, do you mean for the office park now or the banquet tonight?"
41573,toby,I meant for both.
41574,sam," ""Charles Darwin-omics"" for the Chamber of Commerce. ""Trickle-down  travesties.."""
41575,c.j.,That was mine.
41576,c.j.,Good luck. We'll catch up with you later.
41577,sam, They're well-paid technology workers. What happened to courting undecideds?
41578,toby, That's what we're doing.
41579,sam,Darwin-omics at the Chamber of Commerce tonight? That's flamethrower language.
41580,toby,You don't wanna be a flamethrower?
41581,sam,I didn't say that.
41582,toby, Good. You feel alright?
41583,sam,Yeah.
41584,toby, Then let's go.
41585,bartlet,At what point do we start to worry?
41586,bartlet,Hack was 2 hours and 47 minutes.
41587,bartlet,"Yeah, but it's four hours and ten minutes now. I've got three parents, a wife and a  three-year-old up there. At what point do I tell them what's going on?"
41588,leo,How much time before we send some guys in to get the guys we sent in to get the guys..
41589,bartlet, Ask him to confirm it again.
41590,leo,"I gotta tell you something, that was the longest radio silence since Mexico."
41591,bartlet,What's that?
41592,bartlet,What does that mean?
41593,leo,A bomb went off.
41594,bartlet,What's Red Haven?
41595,leo,It's the base in Ghana where the Deltas practiced.
41596,bartlet,"Fitz, what's going on?"
41597,bartlet,It was a suicide bombing.
41598,bartlet, I want Threat Con Charlie for Africa and Europe.
41599,bartlet, Why don't you go talk to the families?
41600,leo,Yes sir. I'll be right back.
41601,leo,They're safe. They're in air space over Morocco.
41602,leo,"Our special ops forces staged a successful rescue. They'll be brought to a hospital at  Ramstein Air Force Base in Germany and they'll be home tomorrow. We'll have communications  set up in a few minutes You can speak with them. The President wishes he could be here  himself to tell you, but he's engaged at the moment."
41603,leo,"The boys are fine, Mrs. Rowe. "
41604,leo,It appears there has been a terrorist retaliation at the makeshift camp we set up in Ghana  to practice for the rescue. 17 staff and administrators were killed.
41605,leo,Someone will be in to take care of you. Thank you.
41615,sam,We are preaching to the choir and that is all we're doing. We packed the whole damn  office park with -- Where the hell did he go?
41616,sam,"No. No, no. Are you open?"
41617,sam,I'm supposed to be next door.
41618,toby,"Hey. Sorry. I didn't catch that last part, you were walking a little fast. "
41619,sam,"You packed the office park with bodies from Labor! AFL, teamsters, it was like the cast  of a James Cagney movie. The reason for the event was to talk to wired workers."
41620,toby,"I didn't want a half-empty rally, and the wired workers are wired to Webb."
41621,sam,"We spent through the day in one-on-ones with Planned Parenthood, Families America, AARP.  You think any of those people are gonna vote for Webb on Election Day?"
41622,toby,Your concern is that those people are gonna stay home and do laundry on Election Day.
41623,sam,"And now I'm supposed to go into Chamber of Commerce and do a chorus and two verses of  ""Titans of Corporate Greed""?"
41624,toby,Problem?
41625,sam,It's the Chamber of Commerce. The titans are the ones in the room.
41626,toby, Can we get a couple of shots and a glass of beer?
41627,sam,We're preaching to the choir.
41628,toby,I'm sorry?
41629,sam,I'm saying you had me preaching to the choir.
41630,toby,Yeah.
41631,sam,Why?
41632,toby,'Cause that's how you get 'em to sing.
41633,sam,"I can just cut any chance I have for victory. The story'll be ""It's over."""
41634,toby,"No. The story's going to be that you actually stuck up for what you believed in, you  didn't cut and run. And people are gonna remember that, I'm gonna make sure of it."
41635,sam,I'm gonna lose.
41636,toby,Yeah.
41637,sam,There's no chance of a miracle?
41638,toby,No.
41639,sam,Then why are you here?
41640,toby,"You're gonna lose, and you're gonna lose huge. They're gonna throw rocks at you next week,  and I wanted to be standing next to you when they did."
41641,sam," Oh, really?"
41642,toby,Yeah.
41643,sam, Really?
41644,toby,Yeah.
41645,sam,Okay.
41646,sam,I'm just getting creamed. I'm just getting worked.
41647,toby,You're not imagining it. 
41648,sam,Thanks.
41649,sam,Yeah. We heard.  We should get back to work.
41650,toby,God Bless the President of the United States and Sam Seaborn.
41651,toby,Let's go.
41652,bartlet,Hello.
41653,bartlet,"Oh, okay. I didn't ask for five?"
41654,bartlet,She's allowed to do that?
41655,bartlet,"Ah, it's okay. Thanks."
41657,bartlet,"Yeah, what the hell's going on?"
41659,bartlet,"I know and when she called me at five, I was going to say call me back in an hour and  go back to sleep. I was going to do it myself."
41661,bartlet,"Yeah, and now I missed the whole thing."
41663,bartlet,Operation Resting Eagle.
41665,bartlet,"You know I was having a little fun in my sleep. It's how I relax. Wait, let me put my  glasses on. Something's turning me on about you, and I can't tell why."
41667,bartlet,"Oh, yeah!"
41669,bartlet,I got in late last night.
41671,bartlet,We didn't even leave Nashville until after ten. I ended up touring a weapons research  facility in Oak Ridge. They've got one of the most powerful reactors in the world.  They were able to show me an insulin molecule. Basically scoop up two zinc ions. 
41673,bartlet,You're a scientist and your still making fun of this?
41675,bartlet,"Anyway, look, I'm trying to tell you something."
41677,bartlet,"You know what? That's okay, I'm going to get that."
41679,bartlet,"No, I'll get them, thanks."
41680,bartlet,"Lay out the papers, yes, and today I'd like you to alphabetize them."
41682,bartlet,"Anyway when we finally got back from Nashville, Leo was waiting."
41684,bartlet,I don't know but we're going to be interested in that less right now than we are in  other things.
41686,bartlet,Foreign Ops came out of mark-up.
41688,bartlet,It's good. They only cut two billion and shifted half a billion from the Sub Saharan  to Western Europe because I guess the crippling hunger in Provence has given the  lactose intolerant a problem with-- I don't know but I can live with all that.
41690,bartlet,Clancy Bangart attached an amendment. 
41692,bartlet,Stipulating that Foreign Ops dollars wouldn't go to any overseas clinics that council  abortion.
41694,bartlet,Yeah.
41696,bartlet,This is the Senate. They can do that.
41698,bartlet,"No, there was no indication. Clancy Bangart doesn't let me know what he's thinking."
41700,bartlet,"There's a handful, a handful and a half of cranky conservative Senators who want this  stuff, and were waiting to pounce. It's what happened."
41702,bartlet,Yeah.
41704,bartlet,I'm sorry?
41706,bartlet,I don't know yet.
41708,bartlet,I don't know.
41710,bartlet,I'm not prepared to do that yet.
41712,bartlet,I don't know.
41714,bartlet,I'm not prepared to do that yet.
41716,bartlet,I know what the gag rule is.
41718,bartlet,"That's great except people are starving to death, and they're dying of disease to death,  and they can't cook the Bill of Rights."
41720,bartlet,"I really don't know Abbey, the day hasn't started yet."
41721,josh,"This is from David Elsin from the USGS-the US Geological Survey-and the Coast Guard  Commander Dennis Travis, ""Last night at 3:45 a.m. Battletree Lake burst through its  natural dam in what is known as a 'glacial lake outburst"". Okay, it's a rushing river  of ice and water and rock. It's about 300 feet wide and it's sweeping through Kachadee  which is a town on one of the sides of the lake."
41722,leo,A 300 foot wide river of ice and rock is sweeping through a small town?
41723,josh,Yeah.
41724,leo,And you think that's funny?
41725,josh,No.
41726,leo,I thought you were trying to be funny.
41727,josh,"No, I'm trying to brief you on a state of emergency in Alaska."
41728,leo,"Oh, sorry, man. We're on the same page now."
41729,josh,We have an agreement with Canada and Russia on for mutual assistance in Artic airborne  rescue so I think the President's going to need to get on the phone or at the very  least be briefed.
41730,leo,"Yeah, me too. I think so too. I'll see to it. Why did it happen? Why did the natural  dam break?"
41731,josh,"The dam was part of a glacier, and the glacier melted."
41732,leo,The glacier melted?
41733,josh,It did.
41734,leo,Glaciers melt once every hundred million years. This one melted today?
41735,josh,"I don't know anything about geology. I think it's been melting for a long time. But,  yeah, 3:45 this morning was the straw that broke the camels back."
41736,leo,All right.
41737,josh,Thank you.
41738,leo,You don't want to stand here for a minute and reflect on the fact that a glacier melted  this morning.
41739,josh,"Well, I would, Leo, but a glacier melted this morning, so at this point Americans are  simply trying to outrun it."
41740,leo,Sure. Thank you. 
41741,josh,"Thank you, Leo."
41743,josh,"A glacier in Alaska melted. You're going to see this on the news in a second. I'll help  you prep C.J., but a natural dam broke, there was flooding, and there's going to be a  lot more. "
41745,josh,Don't fixate on that.
41747,josh,Yeah.
41749,josh,Somebody called?
41751,josh,"C.J., talk to C.J.  He got called by The Globe about Captain Feathersworth."
41753,c.j.,The Globe?
41755,c.j.,Well at Marion Cotesworth-Haye of Marblehead certainly.
41757,c.j.,From doilies?
41759,c.j.,"He wasn't a pirate, he was a privateer."
41761,c.j.,"Yeah, but he worked for us, and he was hired by the fathers of the Daughters of the  American Revolution."
41763,c.j.,It's not our job to tell things to Mrs. Marble-Haye.
41765,c.j.,He was a privateer; he wasn't a pirate.
41767,c.j.,"All right, I think it's time for a visit to the First Lady's office."
41769,c.j.,Yeah.
41771,c.j.,But close wasn't good enough was it?
41773,c.j.,Laugh inappropriately.
41775,c.j.,Let's go.
41794,c.j.,A privateer actually.
41795,c.j.,"Yeah. Anyway, Mrs. Helena Hodsworth Hooter-Tooter of Braintree wants to organize a  boycott of the reception and, well, there it is. Yes, Mrs. Bartlet descends from quite  the murderous band of ruffians, and her membership in the DAR is suspect on those  grounds or so believes the Boston Globe."
41797,toby,Burt.
41798,toby,You were in the building?
41799,toby,Good to meet you. You're working for Kierney-Passaic?
41800,toby,"Mm-hmm, but what do you sell?"
41801,toby,And you're testifying for Polluter Pays?
41802,toby,On behalf of nature?
41803,toby," ""You demonize companies that create..."" You think taxpayers should pay to  clean up pollution instead?"
41804,toby,"That's nice to know, but tomorrow we've got 15 scientists who aren't on industry payroll,  and you'll have..."
41805,toby,"Yeah, well, that's got to help."
41806,toby,Good luck tomorrow.
41807,toby,Yeah.
41808,toby,Yeah?
41809,toby,What?
41810,toby,Yeah.
41811,toby,Burt are you defecting?
41812,toby,"They're due in May. It's a boy and a girl. We can't decide on names. She likes Rebecca  or Sophie for girls. I like Sophie too, but I think a lot of kids are named Sophie now.  And I like Rebecca, but I also like Millicent and, which she doesn't like at all, and  we're nowhere with boy's names."
41813,toby,"But they say it comes to you, and we've got a little time. We're still working on it. "
41814,josh,What's going on?
41815,toby,Hang on.
41816,josh,What's going on?
41817,toby,Cool out.
41818,josh,I got a call that said that--
41819,toby,Cool out.
41820,josh,Who are those two guys talking over there?
41821,toby,Would you cool out?
41822,toby,It's okay. 
41823,toby,"This is Josh Lyman, it's okay."
41824,toby,This is Burt Gantz. Burt's the... what's your title again Burt?
41825,toby,He's testifying tomorrow on Polluter Pays.
41826,josh,"I've, I've read your testimony."
41827,toby,"Yeah, but..."
41828,josh,His testimony's been written already.
41829,josh,And it says?
41830,josh,So we just saved the committee a lot of time.
41831,toby,He wants to change his testimony.
41832,josh,To what?
41833,josh,You have?
41834,josh,What is the amount?
41835,josh,Lots?
41836,josh,So Kierney-Passaic's not been damaging the environment quite so much as they've been--
41837,josh,Stay here and don't say anything to anyone till I call. Who knows he's here?
41838,toby,A lawyer from K-P.
41839,josh, Wait till I call.
41840,josh,It's your first day.
41841,josh,Is it true that everything fell off your wall?
41842,josh,I'm everywhere.
41843,josh,"Okay, but I don't think orientating is a word. Do you have an assignment?"
41844,josh,"Donna, I need to speak to someone from the Council's Office."
41846,josh,Attached a global gag rule to Foreign Ops and the first Lady's fershnicked.
41847,josh,She's fershnicked.
41848,josh,You too?
41849,josh,57%
41850,josh,And I'm one of them.
41851,josh,You think I like it more than you do?
41852,josh,I do not.
41853,josh,He should veto his own bill?
41854,josh,Let me jot that down.
41855,josh,If he does then he has to veto.
41856,josh,"Yeah, but if Amy's plan of magic and wonder doesn't he's got to veto Foreign Ops after  not one, two, but three continuing resolutions. We need a win and 230 million people  overseas need a sandwich so he can't veto Foreign Ops. Donna! "
41857,josh,What?
41858,josh,They tried to attach it to everything in the last four years and we've beaten it back  every time with executive orders but this one's going to be law and we have to eat it.
41859,josh,Why did your stuff fall off the wall?
41860,josh,Donna.
41862,josh,Did you get me in with the council's office?
41864,josh,"All right, after lunch then?"
41866,josh,"Hey, you know how you really want to go to the DAR reception tonight?"
41868,josh,Well you're going. The Secret Service needs us to baby-sit someone. One of the Daughters  of the American Revolution is also the daughter of the ranking member of House Armed  Services.
41870,josh,"Not her, her date. Matthew Lambert, 26, was arrested when he was 21 and a senior at  Emerson. He was arrested for selling drugs and found guilty of a felony and the Secret  Service won't let him in unless someone who's credentialed is watching him."
41872,josh,"Yeah, and he won't know why, so try to be cool."
41874,josh,Or his girlfriend I would think. After lunch with the council's office?
41876,josh,"If you want but don't tell him we regard him as a security risk. It's just, you know,  inhospitable."
41878,leo,Why?
41879,leo,Paul...
41880,leo,"All right, and Canada?"
41881,leo,Can someone tell me why this happened? Is this an act of God?
41882,leo,I'm sorry?
41883,leo,What's a hydroclimatologist?
41884,leo,Are you telling me the deaths this morning are the first fatalities of global warming?
41885,leo,Okay. Can you stay around for a while?
41915,c.j.,Will!
41917,c.j.,She's coming right now.
41918,c.j.,Yes. We think we solved your problem.
41919,c.j.,Marion Cotesworth-Haye of Marblehead.
41920,c.j.,Yes.
41921,c.j.,"Not a problem at all, because we have her here."
41922,c.j.,Here in the Mural room.
41923,c.j.,Turns out she came to Washington.
41924,c.j.,"What do you care? Just go in there and talk it through, and if you feel like that isn't  working, tell her the First Lady wants to give her an award tonight."
41925,c.j.,Save yourself the headache.
41927,c.j.,I did. I did put olives in his jacket but this is on the level.
41928,c.j.,Hang on.
41929,c.j.,I got to make sure I don't laugh.
41930,c.j.,"It's a funny name to me, that's all, just give me a second. Hang on. Okay."
41931,c.j.,Mr. Thomas?
41932,c.j.,"I'm C.J. Cregg. My assistant spoke to you on the phone. Mrs. Cotesworth-Haye, I'm  C.J. Cregg. I'm the White House Press Secretary. This is Will Bailey our Deputy  Communications Director and Amelia Gardner, who's the First Lady's Chief of Staff.  And this is her first day as a matter of fact. We're so happy you could take the  time to come over so we could talk this through."
41933,c.j., I'm sorry. I was... I was... thinking of this thing  from... this thing that just happened... with the deficit. I'm sorry...
41934,c.j.,I swear it's not a hazing. It's real. It's real. I just laughed 'cause of the name.  You've got to fix it.
41935,c.j.,Thank you.
41937,c.j.,You know what happened? I didn't have my game face on.
41938,c.j.,"Anyway, problem solved."
41939,josh,"Hey, is it true your office doors fell down? "
41940,josh,"The guys from Army Counter-Intelligence get a bunch of boys, I don't ask questions."
41941,josh,Hang on.
41942,josh,It's a public lobby.
41943,josh, She really doesn't so everything's fine.
41944,josh,We write SAP's all the time. Saying what?
41945,josh,No.
41946,josh,He's not going to veto Foreign Ops.
41947,josh,He's not going to threaten to veto--
41948,josh,"First of all, I don't think it will."
41949,josh,But if it doesn't?
41950,josh,Then we look like a bunch of empty shirts.
41951,josh,The Senior Staff.
41952,josh,"No, it is not. I am at my most effective for this country when lawmakers are under the  impression that I have influence with the President, so is Leo, and so is Toby, so is  C.J., so is the Vice President. We're not giving back Roe. We're going to swallow it on  Foreign Ops, that is all. It's a good package, and I'm celebrating tonight."
41953,josh,"The daughters of any revolution will do. Listen, I'm not going to ask for an SAP on the  resolution, but I think it's important enough that I don't mind if you go over my head  and ask Leo to call for it."
41954,josh,It's okay to tell Mrs. Bartlet you disagree with her you know.
41955,josh,I know everything.
41956,toby,What does it matter?
41957,toby,Mike? 
41958,toby,"You wanted to become a scientist, but you didn't. You became a lawyer and got a job at  the council's office so let's do that now."
41959,josh,Can we get on with it?
41960,toby,"House Resources is hearing testimony on the Polluter Pays bill. If we can get justice  to grant him immunity under the whistle blower statute, he testify tomorrow and say that  Kierney-Passaic has been hiding dangerous levels of cancer causing whatever in the EPA  reports. It will do tremendous good for us in terms of winning this one. "
41961,josh,Toby?
41962,toby,Yeah?
41963,josh,Plus we retard Kierney-Passaic's progress in killing people.
41964,toby,Josh is right. There are several positive outcomes.
41965,josh,"Mike, can he get whistle blower status?"
41966,toby,Why?
41967,toby,Yes.
41968,toby,Yes.
41969,toby,How is testifying in front of House Resources not lawful?
41970,toby,Oh my God. 
41971,josh,"What do you mean he'd better get it? If he doesn't get it, he doesn't talk."
41972,josh,We have to turn him in now?
41973,josh,I don't understand. All I did was get up in the morning... then I got a message to go  see you.
41974,toby,How come he knows about the rule?
41975,josh,Everybody knows about that.
41976,toby,Was something else on your mind that moment in law school when they taught that rule?  Were you distracted by a bumblebee?
41977,josh,Mike.
41978,toby,You have a lawyer?
41979,toby,"Then why the hell did you come to my office and tell me... I don't care. Mike, let's get  him immunity."
41980,toby,Yeah.
41981,josh,"You going to the DAR thing tonight? It's not that I didn't know the federal law it's...  we... we got in a little deep before I was able to, you know, summon that..."
41982,toby,Shut up.
41997,josh,You don't have to make a big deal out of it. He doesn't have to know he's being tailed.
41999,josh,It may have been.
42001,josh,Okay.
42006,leo,Hi.
42007,c.j.,Hello. 
42008,leo,"I've spent a portion of the day with a hydroclimatologist named Hillary Toobin, who says  that Alaska happened because of greenhouse gas, and seven other geologists think so too."
42009,c.j.,We can't politicize it.
42010,leo,"We have to politicize it, it's politics."
42011,c.j.,It's disrespectful.
42012,leo,"It is, and we'll have to say so."
42013,c.j.,Is Hillary Toobin ready to get publicly scolded by the White House?
42014,leo,"She is. She'll call for a 25% reduction decrease in emissions over the next ten years,  and you'll reprimand her for politicizing the tragedy. What do you think?"
42016,c.j.,You don't want to do it.
42018,leo,I appreciate it.
42026,toby,What are you doing here?
42027,toby,"It didn't occur to me until I asked why you didn't tell your lawyer. You knew what  you were doing the whole way, right? Get the President's muscle to lean on justice  for immunity."
42028,toby,After three years.
42029,toby,That's quite an impressive ethical learning curve.
42030,toby," Really. The U.S. attorneys are going to grill you for a while, but you'll  get the immunity."
42041,bartlet,Will's a good boy.
42043,bartlet,Yeah.
42045,bartlet,Marblehead?
42047,bartlet,"No, some of us call her Marblehead."
42049,bartlet,Cause you're a pirate?
42051,bartlet,I know what they were.
42053,bartlet,Today?
42055,bartlet,"Yeah, you did. "
42057,bartlet,"We don't have to ask you to screw up Abbey, you do by your..."
42059,bartlet,"I can't publicly reprimand you, it wouldn't play well. We save you for other things."
42061,bartlet,You want to hear about Max Weber?
42063,bartlet,"German thinker Max Weber said that politics is the ""slow boring of hard boards and that  anyone who seeks to do it must risk his own soul"". You know what that means?"
42065,bartlet,It means that change comes in excruciating increments for those who want it. You're  trying to move mountains. It takes lifetimes. But Zoey Bartlet is the newest Daughter  of the American Revolution so I like our chances for the long run.
42067,bartlet,Yes.
42069,bartlet,Till the bulk of the bill is appropriated.
42071,bartlet,Yeah. 
42073,bartlet,You don't. 
42075,bartlet,We will. 
42077,bartlet,"Keep talking, I'm going to turn off the light."
42079,bartlet,"No, I have to get up early. "
42080,c.j.,"Because it's 18 hours from Manila, it's 9:25 p.m., Eastern."
42081,c.j.,We left Manila at 3:25 today.
42082,c.j.,"In Manila, it was yesterday."
42083,c.j.,"Well, no, actually, it was tomorrow, but it's 9:25 right now, Eastern. Agreed?"
42084,c.j.,"But it's not, Steve; you can just look out the window and chack that one off the list."
42085,bartlet, He's telling me the deadline for Columbia's recertification is  midnight tonight.
42086,bartlet, Didn't I sign those papers all ready?
42087,leo,"Yes, sir, but the statue requires that you have an in-person briefing on the current  drug situation. So, we'll get you someone to do it in the car on the way in."
42088,bartlet,"Just to check, they're going to tell me that the narco-trafficantes are running the  Parliament, but that we should recertify them as an ally in the drug war."
42089,bartlet,You mean calling them an enemy.
42090,bartlet,"And the deadline for that is today, right?"
42091,bartlet,"Jessie, left turn, maintain altitude?"
42092,bartlet,"Leo, hang on a second.  What's the problem on the ground?"
42093,bartlet,Then what happens?
42094,bartlet,And then what happens?
42095,bartlet,Yeah.
42096,bartlet,You'll keep me briefed?
42097,bartlet,Thank you.
42098,leo,"Listen to me, are you listening? This is one of those things that sounds worse than  it is. I can'y tell you how many times this happens, it's a 30-cent piece of plastic."
42099,bartlet,"Well, it should cost more, don't you think?"
42100,leo,"A friend of mine landing a Beechcraft at Teteboro, puts down the gear, the wheels fall  right off the plane, he ditched it near the Throgs Neck Bridge."
42101,bartlet,You got a lot more of these stories?
42102,leo,"Oh, yeah, a thousand of them. Seriously, man, if they dug a grave for me everytime  I lost an indicator light."
42103,bartlet,I've got a plane full of reporters up here.
42104,leo,C.J. will know what to do.
42105,c.j.,"Good evening, Mr. President."
42106,bartlet,"Charlie, stay in here, would you? Here's what's going on. The light that indicates  that the landing gear is locked didn't go on, which usually indicates that there's  something wrong with the light. But what they're going to do is, they've sent a  fighter jet to fly up alongside and get visual confirmation that it's down, and then  we land. Here's the tricky part."
42107,c.j.,Here's the tricky part?
42108,bartlet,"The press can't know this is going on. There are two issues. One is that the Nikkei's  about to open, the other is national security. We can't broadcast that Air Force One  is up in the air over West Virginia and can't land."
42109,c.j.,The co-pilot told us it was a problem on the ground; we'll stay with that.
42111,c.j.,That's gonna take some thought.
42112,bartlet,Okay.
42113,c.j.,Thank you.
42114,c.j.,Can you give me some tarmac jargon? What would be happening on the ground that the  plane can't land?
42116,c.j.,Are you all right?
42118,c.j.,"Ed, Larry, can you talk to Will for a second?"
42119,c.j.,Has anyone else noticed that Chris's been on the phone for the last 20 minutes but  hasn't spoken?
42120,c.j.,"Hey, who remembers Dial-a-Joke?"
42121,c.j.,"A maintenance truck caused a fuel spill on our runway a few minutes ago, and they're  cleaning it up."
42122,c.j.,I don't know how long it's going to take.
42123,c.j.,Thanks.
42124,c.j.,"Signal, this is C.J. Cregg. I need you to page Leo McGarry with a call holding."
42125,josh,No.
42126,josh,Stop thinking like a Republican.
42127,josh,"And that's fine, I have nothing with that; I really don't. I'm just saying stop  thinking like that."
42128,josh,"It's cleaning up Chesapeake Bay; it's not regulation, and regulation is what  Congressmen do."
42129,josh,"Well, when the Chesapeake starts turning flourescent colors, local business is gonna  have a bigger problem."
42130,josh,And that's why the President's signing it.
42131,josh,"No, it doesn't... feel too regulated; it doesn't have the texture of how do you say,  the je ne sais quios..."
42132,josh,...of big government.
42133,josh,What does Chesapeake mean?
42134,josh,No.
42138,josh,There was a fuel spill on the ground at Andrews. They've to clean it up before he  can land.
42139,josh,"Yeah, I'm gonna head back to my office. Why don't you guys move on to point/nonpoint  source pollution and the storm runoff; I'll be back in a few minutes."
42140,josh,They're having a problem with their landing gear?
42142,josh,"No, you wrote they're having a problem with their landing geek."
42144,josh,"Yeah, but they're saying it's nothing though, right?"
42146,josh,"All right, do me a favor, I wanted the President to look at the Medicare rules."
42148,josh,Congressmen.
42149,josh,"Yeah, they spilled something on the runway; I just got part of the story."
42150,josh,I'm sorry?
42151,josh,Donna...
42153,josh,"Yeah, and you can try and get me C.J. on the phone."
42155,josh,"It's a ""k."""
42156,josh,Chesapeake Bay cleanup.
42157,josh,It's nothing. It's Chesapeake Bay cleanup.
42158,josh,It's a bipartisan bill. It's a victory for us. It's an environmental bill; the  Republicans hate it. It's incredibly regulatory.
42159,josh,"Well, I appreciate your thoughts."
42160,josh,And that's absurd.
42161,josh,Divided governemnt's what we got. We should go on a hunger strike?
42162,josh,Then what?
42163,josh,"Good night, Congressmen."
42164,josh,Toby.
42165,toby,They just told me.
42166,josh,Donna's getting C.J. on the phone.
42167,toby,I sent Will to the Philippines in my place.
42168,josh,It's not like they're not going to fix it. You don't have to feel guilty about it.
42169,toby,"No, I mean, thank God, I sent Will in my place."
42170,josh,How long before they know?
42171,leo,They're about five minutes away.
42172,toby,"Well, that's about all the time C.J.'s got to work with up there 'cause Leo, there's  a wire service guy standing at Andrews right now whose job it is to record the wheels  downtime and pretty soon he's gonna say, ""Show me the fuel spill."""
42173,leo,"A wire guy on the ground? Toby, 20 White House reporters are about to see a supersonic  fighter jet 200 feet outside their window. It's gonna be a story, but he's gonna be  down by then. A couple hours ago, we lost five guys in friendly fire in Kuhndu."
42174,toby,What happened?
42175,leo,A platoon of infantrymen called in an air-strike during live fire training off the  western coast. There was a GPS error and they became the target.
42176,toby,"Oh, God."
42177,leo,"I need you to talk to Mark Richardson right away tonight. He's speaking at Brookings  tomorrow, and he's coming out against U.S. invovlement in Kundu."
42178,toby,"Well, we knew he felt that way."
42179,leo,"We didn't know he was saying so and doing it at the Brookings Institution, so let's  see what we can do."
42180,toby,Okay.
42181,josh,They called in an air raid and the computer hit them as a target. How'd you like to  have to be the guy that explains that?
42182,toby,Were Simmel and Segal giving you a hard time about the Chesapeake cleanup?
42183,josh,They're not big fans of mine.
42184,toby,"I meant 'cause of the nuisance of having to circle around up there. When I said, ""Thank  God, I sent Will instead of me,"" not 'cause of the other thing."
42185,josh,I know what you meant.
42187,c.j.,"Blue Ridge Mountains, what can we look at?"
42188,c.j.,Anything with lights or fireworks?
42189,c.j.,Do they light up?
42191,c.j.,Any kind of Festival of Lights or astronomy? Is there a comet?
42192,bartlet,"Yeah, it's confirmed. Five infantrymen, they're on their way back."
42193,c.j.,Have the families been notified?
42194,bartlet,"No. I'm going to do that when I get on the ground. Will, I was supposed to get a  Columbia recertification briefing in the car. Are you in a position to do it up here?"
42196,bartlet,That statue says it's got to be in person.
42198,bartlet,That Columbia is an ally in the drug war. So what's the plan?
42199,c.j.,Ed and Larry are looking for something in the Blue Ridge Mountains.
42200,bartlet,At night?
42201,c.j.,Something with lights.
42202,bartlet,Is that gonna work?
42204,bartlet,"All right, let's get this over with and land."
42205,c.j.,"Okay, its time. It's a minute away."
42208,c.j.,Yeah.
42210,c.j.,"No, you have to. I screw with them all them time. They're not going to but it from me."
42212,c.j.,It's not worth a try? Look at me. Look at my face. It's not worth a try?
42214,c.j.,Listen.
42221,c.j.,"Signal, this is C.J. Cregg. Shut off the phones in the press cabin. "
42222,c.j.,There's a problem with the plane's landing gear.
42223,bartlet,Is it down?
42224,bartlet,Why not?
42225,bartlet,What's next?
42226,bartlet,How close do we fly to the tower?
42227,bartlet,At what altitude?
42228,bartlet,And we just can't stay up here for a couple of days and wait till there's a moon?
42229,bartlet,What else?
42230,bartlet,"Larry, would you go back and mention that to C.J.?"
42231,c.j.,No one up here's in a position to file right now.
42232,c.j.,That's the story you'd file? You wouldn't mention the landing gear?
42233,c.j.,"Come on. The maintenance truck was an honest effort to avoid panic. Of course, you were  going to know the truth at the end of the incident."
42234,c.j.,"I'm not going to broadcast that the President's plane is in distress. It creates very  real security concerns, and it also happens to be a world market event."
42235,c.j.,"The story's embargoed. If a cellphone appears in violation of FAA regulations, the  cell phone will be confiscated by a steward."
42237,c.j., They want to refuel.
42238,c.j.,How do they do that?
42240,c.j.,"Yeah, they're going to do a midair refueling with a KC-10."
42241,c.j.,It means they think we're going to be up here a little while longer.
42242,leo,"Theoretically, they can keep getting refueled for months."
42243,leo,"Me, neither. The Falcon's going to give them a thumb's up, or thumb's down."
42244,leo,"You guys shouldn't be talking about it out there, all right?"
42245,josh,You want me?
42246,leo,You had a conversation with Simmel and Segal a little while ago?
42247,josh,About the Chesapeake cleanup.
42248,leo,They're just pissed as hell that Tom Landis is sitting out there working in the  Roosevelt Room.
42249,josh,He didn't storm the gate.
42250,josh,"Well, they would have preferred he had, to your opening it for him."
42251,josh,"I get the House is angry we didn't take back the House, and setting aside the fact it  was their damn fault and not ours-- stopping all bipartisan legislation is like saying,  ""Let's blow up the place. Maybe voters will hire us to rebuild it."""
42252,leo,"I'm with you, but I need you guys to make a small change to Chesapeake."
42253,josh,We're finishing it now. What do you need?
42254,leo,The caucus chair and the D-triple-C want to add revenue enhancement-- a dedicated levy  from local businesses-- and they want binding targets on all the nonpoint source stuff.
42255,josh,Okay. That's about three different ways of saying a brand-new tax on local business.
42256,leo,Yes.
42257,josh,"I'm fine with that. Fact, I'm all for it, but Tom's got to take this back to Republicans."
42258,leo,"And we have to take it to Democrats, and it's reasonable. We put the same provisions  in Superfund."
42259,josh,Super. What's going on up there?
42260,leo," The F-16's having trouble seeing the  gear, 'cause it's a moonless night. They just took on another four hours worth of fuel."
42261,leo,"Major, are we comfortable any longer with the plane up there by itself? I agree. And  there's going to be a wire service reporter on the ground at Andrews who's going to  start seeing something. You better have them spill some fuel out there. Please, on a  runway we're not going to need.  Well, at least all our friends are going to have some company now. The 22nd  Tactical Fighter Wing with their missiles armed."
42262,toby,I'm Toby Ziegler.
42263,toby,Thank you.
42264,toby,"Congressman, I'm afraid I have some bad news. One of your constituents died today.  Gunnery Sergeant Harold Dokes from Bedford Stuyvesant. It was a friendly fire accident.  Five guys reported fire, and a computer popped their coordinates. And their bodies are  being flown here now."
42265,toby,"Your speech at the Brookings Institution tomorrow. Congressman, are you opposing  intervention in Kuhndu because so far, it's the black kids who are doing the dying?"
42266,toby,"Yeah, but the fact that this is immediate. I mean to say, the mass slaughter of tens of  thousands of Africans-- mostly young men-- which calls for..."
42267,toby,Maximum? No.
42268,toby,The lives we're saving in Kuhndu-- and I agree...
42269,toby,But you agree there ar moral imperatives?
42270,toby,"Mark, obviously, we need votes from the Black Caucus next week. Are you telling me it  isn't in the vested interest of Black America?"
42271,toby,And how is opposing the peacekeeping bill at Brookings going to achieve...?
42272,toby,Doing what?
42273,toby,You want to draft a million middle-class kids out of spite?
42274,toby,Thank you.
42277,josh,Good.
42279,josh,Huh?
42281,josh,No one's feeling useful right now.
42283,josh,What are you doing right now?
42285,josh,How come you go out with so many Republicans?
42287,josh,"You do. Cliff, Commander Wonderful, Dr. Freeride."
42289,josh,Do you know how to lock the landing gear?
42291,leo,"Let's go. You got the, uh...?"
42292,leo,"And the, uh...?"
42293,leo,Thank you.
42294,leo,On the runway?
42295,leo,It's flame retardant. They're worried about fire.
42296,leo,You can take this back to the office.
42297,leo,Any movement?
42298,toby,No.
42299,leo,He knows about the kid from Bed-Stuy?
42300,toby,"Yeah, he's got a long list of kids from Bed-Stuy. The Black Caucus is going to back the  peacekeeping bill, if we back their amendment to reinstate the draft."
42301,leo,He's really going through with that stunt?
42302,toby,Yeah.
42303,leo,"Well, the left's come full cricle, hasn't it? By the way, not for nothing but draftees  are nearly as well-trained. It's why there was so many casualties in Vietnam."
42304,toby,"Right, also the Vietcong."
42305,leo,Plus that.
42306,toby,What if we said we'd allow debate?
42307,leo,"It's a stunt and Kuhndu is for real. We can't get involved in... Talk to OMB, and find  out what we can give him. Wake somebody up. I got to go meet with Nancy."
42308,bartlet,Is cocaine production in Columbia up or down?
42310,bartlet,And how many of our extradition requests have been honored?
42312,bartlet,None.
42314,bartlet,Any good news? Anything we can hang our hat on?
42316,bartlet,That's good news?
42318,bartlet,What they spend it on? If you tell me coccaine...
42320,bartlet,"So, I recertify them in recognition of the fact that they took our anti-drug money  and went to Seaworld."
42322,bartlet,"All right, leave that stuff with me."
42328,c.j.,Four hours of fuel they took on. Did you even know it was up there?
42330,c.j.,It's okay. You're afraid of flying.
42332,c.j.,Why'd you sign up for the Air Force Reserve?
42334,josh,"Hey, everybody, how's it going in here?"
42335,josh,I don't know why it's taking so long to clean fuel up off a runway. It must be...  I don't know.
42336,josh,I guess not.
42337,josh,"I'm sure that's what they are going to do if, you know... Listen, uh, I want to read  over what we got now. But we're all done here, except the Causcus Chair wants to add  something we had on Superfund, which is revenue enhancements."
42338,josh,Yeah.
42339,josh,A dedicated levy.
42340,josh,Yeah.
42341,josh,Both.
42342,josh,We can find more offsets. There's a way to do this.
42343,josh,"Of course we want to... Whatever Republican votes we may lose, we're going to make up  on the other side."
42345,josh,"Yes, it will. Now you got to stay here. You got to find more offsets and more ways to  bury them."
42346,josh,Yes.
42348,leo,The Black Caucus just walked off the Kundu Peacekeeping Bill.
42350,josh,What are Angel Maintenance procedures?
42352,josh,I didn't know that.
42354,josh,"Why didn't I know that Airlift Ops calls the plane ""Angel""?"
42356,josh,"All right, well, deal with them now."
42358,josh,Yeah.
42360,josh,"Well, we don't have a problem with people's luggage tonight. You call your guys at  Airlift ops. Tell them they got to get you ready to educate the Press Secretary on  maintenance procedures as soon as Angel's on the ground."
42363,bartlet,"How many times-- seriously, Leo-- how many times has the Black Caucus on retreats,  at dinners... how many times have they...? There was a dinner two years where the  Vice Chairs literally pulled out a map of Africa. They wanted me to make Africa a  priority. And now they're making me look like a idiot."
42364,bartlet,"Well, now they want me to make Brooklyn a priority. And when did these guys become  Smoot and Hawley? Hang on a second. "
42365,bartlet," Jessie Weiskopf's coming down, and he ain't smiling."
42366,bartlet,"Okay, and how long do you think this'll take?"
42367,bartlet,An hour and 15? Where are we?
42368,bartlet,"All right, pretty soon though, we got to stop just flying around."
42369,bartlet,This is starting to qualify as space travel now.
42370,bartlet,"The Falcon couldn't get a visual read, so we're going to buzz the tower at Andrews in  a Boeing 747. Weiskopf says it's going to be an hour and 15 minutes. I'm going to call  the families from up here of the five guys."
42371,bartlet,Thanks.
42372,leo,"Thank you, Mr. President.  They're going to fly by the towers at Andrews."
42373,leo,They have their back wheels. Can you get me C.J.?
42374,bartlet,Will.
42376,bartlet,I'm going to call the families now. They're going to send up some information. Can you  help me out?
42378,bartlet,Just give this to C.J. You should read it on the way.
42380,bartlet,Do me a favor. Find out what happens if I don't certify Columbia. Find out what happens  if I decertify Columbua.
42382,bartlet,"If I'm going to be up here, I may as well do something."
42384,bartlet,The fly-by's going to take about an hour and 15 minutes. Would you tell C.J.?
42386,c.j.,Yeah.
42387,c.j.,There is.
42388,c.j.,Somebody ask Steve what time it is. It's going to crack you up.
42389,c.j.,How is it a threat to anyone on the ground?
42390,c.j.,Steve...
42391,c.j.,By screwing with the front wheel?
42392,c.j.,"No, your right. I should definitely let you use the phone."
42393,c.j.,We're going to do a fly-by at Andrews. This thing's almost over.
42394,toby,What are you doing?
42395,leo,Hey.
42396,toby,What are you doing?
42397,leo,Did OMB have anything?
42398,toby,"Budget didn't have anything Mark wants. He can call OMB himself. Leo, let's say we study..."
42399,leo,Come on.
42400,toby,Study some version of his amendment.
42401,leo,We'll look ridiculous.
42402,toby,It's not ridiculous.
42403,leo,It's a stunt.
42404,toby,"It is, but it's not ridiculous. We say we're going to study the draft and..."
42405,leo,There's never going to be a draft.
42406,toby,Mark knows that. He wants the debate. We want our peacekeeping appropriation.  Everybody's happy.
42407,leo,Hardly anybody's happy. The President's going to study reinstating... We're for  peacekeeping in Kuhndu.
42408,toby,And Mark's point is who keeps the...
42409,leo,I know what Mark's point is.
42410,toby,People who got nowhere else to go...
42411,leo,"For advancement, they go for advancement."
42412,toby,"The five guys on their way home right now... didn't advance very far, I think is  Mark's point."
42413,leo,"It was a computer error, Toby."
42414,toby,"Yeah, I know."
42415,leo,"Find out what ""considering the amendment"" has to look like in order for the Black  Caucus to stay onboard."
42416,toby,I will. Thank you.
42418,bartlet,We lose some money.
42420,bartlet,"Right, but at the moment, I'm more concerned with our credibility. He told me at the  Summit of the Americas that he'd work toward crop diversification. Did he mean opium  and coke?"
42422,bartlet,"Yes, but he's not helping us, so why should I give him political cover? Listen, I'm  serious. What would happen if I don't recertify Columbia?"
42424,bartlet,I can't what?
42426,bartlet,Why?  Because the deadline was midnight...
42428,bartlet,The actual signed paper?
42430,bartlet,This is really how the world works.
42432,bartlet,I want this plane to land!
42434,bartlet,"All right, thanks."
42436,josh,You wanted to see me?
42437,leo,The Chesapeake cleanup isn't going to happen.
42438,josh,At all.
42439,leo,It's not going to come out of Committee.
42440,josh,'Cause of the revenue enhancements?
42441,leo,I think a little of everything.
42442,josh,What happened?
42443,leo,"Well, look, they weren't wild about it in the first place."
42444,josh,What happened?
42445,leo,Deaver didn't like that Landis was working so closely with you.
42446,josh,Did those two idiots let the Republicans on the Committee know? They were already  pissed at him.
42447,leo,"He's vulnerable, and they want his seat. We take back the House, there's any number,  um... Mileage standards, reauthrize CWA-- any number of things we can do to help the  environment more."
42448,josh,Is the President supposed to open a pizzeria while the Republicans control Congress?
42449,leo,We got the peacekeeping appropriation next week. I don't want to get in to it over  $18 million for Chesapeake Bay.
42450,josh,We're going to lose an ally in Landis.
42451,leo,"Well, one way or another, I think we're going to lose Landis."
42452,josh,And they say the two parties can't get together on anything. 
42453,leo,The pizzeria thing was funny.
42454,josh,Thank you.
42456,josh,I just needed Leo for a second.
42458,josh,The guys you're talking to-- what do they think happened?
42460,josh,Why?
42462,josh,What'd they say?
42464,josh,Okay.
42465,josh,Pretty soon.
42466,josh,As soon as Andrews waved off the plane. Would you guys mind? Could you give us the  room for a second?
42467,josh,"It's not the Democrats this time, it's the Republicans. It's not going to happen."
42468,josh,"It's not going to get out of Committee. The White House is going to have to pull its  support, but there's room in the EPA budget, room in the interior budget."
42469,josh,Yeah.
42470,josh,"So are the Republicans, Tom. You're probably going to have a primary challenge."
42471,josh,That's who's beatable.
42472,josh,This is something that was never in my lap the right way.
42473,josh,"Well, tht's a bit of an overstatement... isn't it?"
42474,josh,Thanks for the work.
42475,josh,I will.
42476,toby,He said I should come in.
42477,toby,"""The President does not think we shoud reinstate the draft nor does he intend to do so,  but he respects Chairman Richardson as a leader in the Congress, and he's eager to hear  what he has to say and to engage in thorough debate."""
42478,toby,What C.J. will say tomorrow from the podium in exchange for votes of the Black Caucus  on peacekeeping in Kuhndu.
42479,toby,"No, it'll screw us the regular amount."
42480,toby,"Actually, the money ended up coming in handier than the soldiers."
42481,toby,"You don't, Congressman. I was just on the job tonight."
42482,toby,125. It was the last six months of the draft. It went up to 90 that year... but I  didn't have the 300 bucks.
42483,toby,I'd like to stay if you don't mind.
42484,toby,Yeah.
42485,c.j.,Are we near the tower?
42486,c.j.,What?
42487,c.j.,"Signal, this is C.J. Cregg. Please turn the phones back on in the press cabin. "
42488,c.j.,We're landing. We got an indicator light. You should feel free to file. Thank you all  very much.
42489,c.j.,Thank you.
42490,c.j.,Oh. 
42491,c.j.,You heard?
42493,c.j.,Sit down. 
42494,c.j.,I was meaning to ask you. Why did you ask about the front wheel before? You asked the  Colonel if it was the front wheel.
42496,c.j.,To whack it into place?
42498,c.j.,I'm so happy I didn't have that information.
42500,c.j.,It just suddenly worked?
42502,c.j.,Yeah.
42504,c.j.,I'm not sure I'm good at living in a world where that kind of thing is possible.
42506,c.j.,"I imagine myself destitute, I imagine myself unlucky in love. But I never imagine my  life would be in danger with really uncommon frequency. It feels a little bit good,  doesn't it?"
42508,c.j.,"Yes, it does."
42510,c.j.,At the exact moment of the equinox. At the exact moment of the equinox.
42511,josh,It doesn't work.
42512,c.j.,It does work. It has to be the exact moment of the equinox.
42513,josh,It doesn't work.
42514,c.j.,I've seen it.
42515,josh,I've tried it.
42516,c.j.,And?
42517,josh,It doesn't work.
42518,c.j.,I don't think you did it at the exact moment.
42519,josh,I did.
42520,c.j.,When?
42521,josh,Last September.
42522,c.j.,That was the Autumnal equinox.
42523,josh,It only works for the Vernal equinox?
42524,c.j.,Yeah.
42525,josh,You know what's more likely? 
42526,c.j.,That it doesn't work at all?
42527,josh,That's right.
42528,c.j.,"It does, I've seen it."
42529,leo,"We've got pastrami from Krupin's. It's tissue paper thin. Roast beef, corned beef, turkey,  Russian dressing, coleslaw, and seedless rye, and winning the heard earned money of your  coworkers. This is what I call a night off. Squeeze this piece of rye bread."
42530,c.j.,Now what do I do?
42531,leo,Yeah.
42532,josh,Something that's true at the vernal equinox would also have to be true at the autumnal  equinox.
42533,c.j.,Why?
42534,josh,Equinox means equal night. Night and day are both 12 hours long.
42535,c.j.,What does that have to do with it?
42536,josh,It doesn't work. I've tried it.
42537,toby,"Listen, there's..."
42538,josh,Hang on. C.J. believes that at the exact moment of the vernal equinox...
42539,c.j.,And only at that moment.
42540,josh,You can stand an egg vertically.
42541,toby,Huh?
42542,josh,At the equinox you can stand an egg on its end.
42543,toby,"Yeah, that doesn't work."
42544,josh,You've tried it?
42545,toby,"I don't need to try it, you can't stand an egg on its end. The elements involved with  creating an equinox have no connection to the center of gravity of an egg."
42546,c.j.,I've seen it.
42547,toby,"I've seen guys make ace of spades jump out of their shoes, I don't think it was the  equinox."
42549,josh,Yeah?
42551,josh,Tonight?
42553,josh,Yeah.
42555,josh,"I miss Ainsley. That's who the Counsel's office should get to fill that position,  another Ainsley. A sexy conservative with first-rate law credentials and a strange name."
42557,josh,Who else is playing in this game?
42558,toby,Anyone with currency.
42559,bartlet,Why are you so eager to get in this game?
42560,bartlet,Seriously.
42561,bartlet,"This is a cash game, Debbie. These are hard working people blowing off some steam and  taking each other off their coin. We don't play for matchsticks and we don't play... "
42562,bartlet,"...Okay, can I ask you something? I forgot to have Charlie to draw cash for me, can you  float me a little?"
42563,leo,Sir.
42564,bartlet,"Leo, C.J. swears that on the equinox, which is today, you can stand an egg on end."
42565,leo,Debbie?
42566,bartlet,"Yeah, you can play."
42567,leo,We just lost an unmanned spy plane.
42568,bartlet,Where?
42569,leo,"It was an Predator B-UAB 12 miles of Kaliningrad. It's controlled by satellite which  can't always adjust to sudden weather changes, and this one veered off course and  crashed inland."
42570,bartlet,Well that's why these are unmanned right? All we lost was money? Aren't they saying  detonate the plane?
42571,leo,The plane was taking pictures of illegal nuclear transfers in the region and we need  the intelligence 'cause they don't think we're going to get it again.
42572,bartlet,"Well, what do they want me to do, call Chigorin and ask if we can go in and get our  spy plane back?"
42573,leo,Yes sir. Except you can't say spy plane.
42574,bartlet,"Wait, you're serious. They want me to call Chigorin?"
42575,leo,Yes.
42576,bartlet,And ask him for the plane back without telling him we were spying?
42577,leo,State and the Pentagon have some ideas how you might try that.
42578,bartlet, Do they?
42579,leo,"In the mean time, sir, want to play some cards?"
42580,bartlet,Hang on. 
42581,bartlet,"Yeah, this isn't going to work."
42582,toby,Three.
42583,c.j.,Three.
42584,bartlet,You're fine?
42585,bartlet, Check.
42586,josh,Check.
42587,toby,Check.
42588,c.j., Check.
42589,josh,Fold.
42590,toby,I'm out.
42591,c.j.,Take it.
42592,josh,Nothing like the mounting tension of a well contested hand.
42593,bartlet,You were full of crap. You had jack-high or something?
42595,c.j.,Did you get the eggs?
42597,bartlet,"Hang on. Will, why are you dressed like an officer in the Air Force?"
42599,bartlet,You're a reservist?
42601,bartlet,I didn't know that.  Did you know that?
42602,c.j., He's First Lieutenant Will.
42603,bartlet,I had no idea. What do you do?
42605,bartlet,And this is your weekend up?
42607,bartlet,Well good for you. Where are you stationed?
42609,bartlet,They're ready?
42610,bartlet, Play my seat.
42611,bartlet,Are we getting somewhere?
42612,leo,"Oh yeah. You know, there was a thought that since Kaliningrad is the only non-contiguous  Russian state you could make like you were just informing Chigorin of a rescue mission  that barely concerns him."
42613,bartlet,"And what do I do when Chigorin tells me that Hawaii's not really part of America, and  he wants to change the alphabet to Cyrillic?"
42614,leo, Seymour! What does he do?
42615,bartlet, What the hell.
42616,leo,"Would you, please? I'm not going to have you tell Chigorin that Kaliningrad's not part  of Russia."
42617,bartlet,What area are we trolling in?
42618,leo,What area?
42619,bartlet,Yes.
42620,leo,"We weren't spying on Russia, we were spying for Russia."
42621,bartlet,We were spying for him?
42622,leo,"Yes, sir."
42623,bartlet,"Okay, this phone call you're going to set up with Chigorin...it's like for a White  House bloopers reel or something?"
42624,leo,Just give us a couple of minutes.
42625,bartlet,All right.
42626,leo,Two things I want to put on your radar.
42627,bartlet,Yeah.
42628,leo,There was a bombing at a nightclub in Kuala Lumpur and they've got a suspect in Berlin  who was trying to explode a device at the Brandenberg gate.
42629,bartlet,Are the two related?
42630,leo,"I don't know, but there were two so I wanted to tell you about it."
42631,bartlet, All right.
42632,toby,Check.
42633,c.j.,Check.
42634,josh,Out.
42635,c.j.,I'm out.
42637,toby,Call.
42639,c.j.,Here's an extra card.
42641,c.j.,"Oh my God, did you see that? Did you guys see that?!"
42642,josh,We're not going to need that three of clubs?
42644,toby,"No, I don't believe that's true."
42646,toby,I believe it's a myth.
42648,josh,"51, the three of clubs."
42649,toby,Dollar a card?
42652,josh,Yeah. 
42654,josh,Which guy is this?
42656,josh, Deal me out for three hands.
42658,josh,Yeah.
42660,josh,Yeah.
42662,josh,Uh-huh.
42664,josh,Your sense of humor's a bit of a high wire act isn't it? You're really trying to thread  the needle.
42666,josh,Give me that.
42667,josh,Hector?
42668,josh,Are you Hector?
42670,josh,Can I just ask?
42672,josh,Are you saying it's Hector you're saying is good looking or is it...?
42674,josh,Okay.
42676,josh,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
42677,josh,"Excuse me, Joseph?"
42678,josh,Josh Lyman. 
42679,josh,Joe?
42680,josh,"No, I was asking, do you like to be called Joe?"
42681,josh,Were you saying yes to that the first time?
42682,josh,"It's funny, it's what I was just saying, the person who created the job opening, her  name was Ainsley Hayes, and she was, uh, a very attractive woman, and I was saying  that we needed to find another attractive woman with an unusual name, and, here,  you're a man and your name is Joe."
42683,josh,"You've go to be asking yourself why I told you that story. Ah, you have a joint JD-MBA?"
42684,josh,What does a staff attorney do at the New York City Department of Transportation?
42685,josh,Slipping on the sidewalk?
42686,josh,Banging your head on a turnstile?
42687,josh,After a JD-MBA from Cal?
42688,josh,"Then Associate Council at Treasury, then the Solicitor General's office... Why did  you leave the Solicitor General's office?"
42689,josh,You weren't a political appointee?
42690,josh,I'm surprised we haven't met.
42691,leo,Excuse me.
42692,josh,"I'll be back in a second. You forgot to sign the bottom of the questionnaire, the SF-86.  You've got to sign your name."
42693,leo,"If the President says yes, we're going to set up the call in about 10 minutes."
42694,bartlet,What do we have?
42695,leo,"All right. Best case scenario, is that he lets our guys get it untouched by Russian hands."
42696,bartlet," But President Bartlet, we have a terrific search-and-recovery team.  We'll just go get that plane for you."
42697,leo," President Chigorin, I very much appreciate the offer, but our UAV's have  self-detonating capabilities, and only our folks know how to make it de-operational."
42698,bartlet,"""Our folks""? You really think I'd use those words with the Russian President?"
42699,josh,"You say, ""Sir, this UAV has proprietary American technology on it made by one of our  leading aerospace companies and we have to protect that""."
42700,bartlet,"""Much as I have to protect Kaliningrad, sir, which brings us to the question of what  the hell were you doing flying over it?"""
42701,leo,It had a multiple mission.
42702,bartlet,Did it?
42703,leo,Exactly for this purpose.
42704,bartlet,What was the other mission?
42705,leo,Taking satellite pictures of coastal erosion in the Baltic Sea?
42706,bartlet,I tell him it was an environmental mission?
42707,leo,It was an environmental mission.
42708,bartlet,"Okay, and he's not going to want to take pictures of coastal erosion at Coney Island?"
42709,leo,"No. The Baltic Sea is shared by Sweden, Finland, and Germany."
42710,bartlet,We were on an environmental mission for Finland?
42711,leo,"Yes, sir."
42712,bartlet,That's what we've come up with?
42713,leo,It's what we're starting with. We'll see how it goes.
42714,bartlet,Set up the call.
42715,josh,Sorry about that.
42716,josh,Yeah.  Don't forget to sign this thing. They just have a whole...
42717,josh,"I'm sorry, ah, tell me again why you left the solicitor's office."
42718,josh,"He brought in a new staff. Um, you've already talked with Judy Wells?"
42719,josh,And Oliver Babish?
42720,josh,They made you fill out the psychological part of the questionnaire?
42721,josh,"Question 1: A] I do not feel sad, B] I feel sad, C] I am sad all the time and I can't  snap out of it, D] I am so sad or unhappy that I want to kill myself. You chose A] I  do not feel sad."
42722,josh,Good. Ever?
42723,josh,"No, you don't ever feel sad or..."
42724,josh,"Yet you checked the first box, why is that?"
42725,josh,Okay. This'll just take another minute or so.
42727,c.j.,I'm locking the door; there are still some press around.
42728,toby,Five dollars if you hit the sixth.
42729,c.j.,There's a spot on the earth where the temperature is exactly the same as it would be  if you drilled through the earth to the other side.
42731,c.j.,"Yes, there is, and it's called the antipode. And if that's true, then why can't it be  that you could stand an egg on end at the equinox?"
42732,toby,'Cause you can't ever.
42733,c.j.,And I say that neither of you can hit the fifth row.
42734,toby,At the same time?
42737,toby,Get down.
42738,c.j., Somebody's shooting!
42740,toby,Stay still.
42741,toby,We're alright.
42742,c.j.,We're alright.
42744,toby,Is the President in the Oval Office?
42745,bartlet,He's on?
42746,bartlet,"Let's go.  Mr. President, this is President Bartlet."
42747,bartlet,What the hell?
42748,bartlet,"Okay, you know what, I'm going to have to call you back."
42749,bartlet," Bamboo, they want me to get into the motorcade."
42750,bartlet,What's going on? 
42751,bartlet,I'm all right.
42752,leo,These people are all code word and higher.
42753,bartlet,I was on the phone with Chigorin. 
42754,bartlet,He's got code word clearance. 
42755,bartlet,Was anyone in the room? 
42756,leo,Where are they? 
42757,bartlet,Nobody was hurt? 
42758,toby,Sir.
42759,bartlet, You all right?
42760,toby,Yeah
42761,bartlet, What about you?
42762,c.j.,We're fine.
42763,bartlet," Will, how many fingers am I holding up?"
42765,bartlet,"I don't know if you've met Ron Butterfield, the head of my detail."
42767,leo,"Lieutenant Bailey, I'm glad to see you alive, but it's code word clearance in here,  and I need you out of earshot, okay?"
42769,bartlet,Where's Charlie?
42770,leo,He's somewhere in the building.
42771,bartlet,"But if he's heard what happened, he's going to be trying to get here..."
42772,bartlet,"No, I'm telling you that if Charlie heard there were bullets, he's going to overpower  whoever's trying to..."
42773,bartlet,Come here.
42774,bartlet,"It's bulletproof glass in the windows, okay. You want to kill me, you're going to have  to do it from inside the building."
42775,bartlet,"I'm surprised your guys managed to keep Fiderer in her chair. I would have thought she'd  be the first one through the d... No, here we are."
42776,bartlet,"No one was hurt, someone shot at the press briefing room from the sidewalk."
42777,bartlet,"Will's sitting right outside, and Toby and C.J. are standing right there. "
42778,bartlet,Yeah.
42779,leo,"Ron, there were two incidents of terrorist activity earlier today. A bomb in Malaysia  and another in Berlin."
42780,bartlet,"This was just a crazy guy, Leo."
42781,leo,That was just a third on the phone in Guam. The head of the Office of Insular Affairs  was picked off.
42782,bartlet,Come on.
42783,leo,"By a sniper, Mr. President."
42784,c.j.,"All right, then here it is. ""An indeterminate number of shots were fired at the White  House at..."" I said I thought it was three shots but I want for the agents to...Okay,  ""At 9:23 pm, striking the Press Briefing Room""..."
42785,c.j.,We haven't confirmed any ballistics. Tell your friends to stop saying it was an M-16.
42786,c.j.,All right. The President was in the Oval Office. We've initiated a standard lockdown  procedure and are back to conducting the business of the nation... I'll ask him.  He wants to know if the President wants to say something funny.
42787,c.j.,"Something funnier than that, but yeah."
42788,josh,You're getting to see a show tonight.
42789,josh,Yeah.
42790,josh,A guy shot at the building a couple of times with a rifle.
42791,josh,Yeah.
42792,josh,The street. Pennsylvania Avenue.
42793,josh,Hmm?
42794,josh,"No, but we're in a crash. A lockdown. They're not going to let you leave the West Wing."
42795,josh,"No, but I heard a brass quintet playing ""The First Noel,"" so I just assumed somebody  somewhere was locked and loaded."
42796,josh," Uh, they told me you're just here tonight. Do you  have to catch a plane?"
42797,josh,"Well, we don't know what this is yet."
42798,josh,"Yeah. Yeah. No, that's the first time it's happened to us anyway."
42799,josh,Yeah.
42800,josh,I don't know.
42801,josh,"Well, he was shooting a modified M-16. It was terrorism."
42802,josh, He shot at the White House.
42803,josh,"I have no earthly idea why he shot at us, nor for that matter do I have any reason to  believe it was a he. "
42804,josh,"That's my assistant, Donna. "
42805,josh,Excuse me a sec.
42807,josh,You were in the mess?
42809,josh,Yeah.
42811,josh,I was in here.
42813,josh,No.
42815,josh,I'm all right.
42817,josh,I don't know. I haven't been talking to him that long.
42819,josh,"He-he's well qualified, that's for sure... He's personable, and he's confident..."
42821,josh,It's the strangest feeling. It's like a... really good baseball player is standing  in the other teams locker room for the first time.
42823,josh,He's the baseball player.
42825,josh,Yeah.
42827,josh,You asked me what I thought of him so far.
42829,josh,I'm fine. I was in here. I didn't even see it.
42831,josh,"I'm sorry, what were we talking about?"
42832,josh,"Right.  I got a letter today that said, uh... ""You're a lying liar.  You lie almost as well as Bartlet."" You know, black-white, rich-poor, north-south,  odd-even. There may not be anything anymore that outpaces the hatred the right feels  for the left or the tonnage of disrespect the left feels for the right. Donna got a  letter yesterday that said, ""I'm collecting all the guns you've banned, and there's a  bullet with your name on it in each one."" Donna. The guy's decided to focus his wrath  on Donna. He's never met Donna or spoken to her, and he's never met anyone who's met  Donna or spoken to her. How's it possible? How's it possible that he hates her so much?  How can you not like Donna? She's from Wisconsin! Anyway, 20,000 specific threats made  against U.S. targets every year, and with all that, it's still the ones who don't give  you advance notice that you're worried about. "
42833,josh,A bombing in Malaysia and another one in Berlin a few hours ago.
42834,josh,Might as well use this time for the interview.
42835,c.j.,You can stand the egg on the equinox because that's when the sun's gravity is lined up  directly with the earth's.
42836,toby," Draw a line from the center of the earth to  the sun, and at anytime, someplace on earth is on that line.."
42837,c.j.,Then maybe for us...
42838,toby,"C.J., try it. Take an egg, it doesn't work."
42839,c.j.,That's 'cause it's not...
42840,c.j.,Yes.
42842,c.j.,I don't know... midnight?
42844,c.j.,"All right, maybe it's not at the exact moment of the equinox. Maybe it's at some point  during the equinox and you just have to keep trying, but I've seen it."
42847,leo," Donna, would you tell Josh we're back on?"
42849,c.j.,Did you know that a day on the moon and a year on the moon are the same thing?
42850,toby,I did. 
42851,c.j.,"I thought my reflexes before, in the Press Room, were cat-like."
42852,bartlet,You guys playing again?
42853,josh,"Yeah, the game's started up."
42854,bartlet,"President Chigorin, it's Jed Bartlet again. I'm sorry about being abrupt before, but I  bet if you turn on CNN international right now you'll see..."
42855,bartlet,"Yeah, there you go. It's not a big deal, but they shut us down for a little bit."
42856,bartlet,By the way when they crash the building they don't crash all of it. The Situation Room  still works.
42857,bartlet,"Mr. President, a little while ago an unmanned B-UAV drone crashed, we think somewhere  inside Kaliningrad, as a matter of fact. Apparently they don't respond, you know, quite  the way you'd like when there's a sudden shift in the weather."
42858,bartlet,"Well, like I say, it was a UAV, it was taking satellite pictures of coastal erosion in  the Baltic Sea. The Finns know about this. We'd like to send a special operations team  ten kilometres west of Borsakova to retrieve it."
42859,bartlet,"I'm sorry, sir?"
42860,bartlet,Are you getting that translation right?
42861,bartlet,"You campaigned on the environment, Mr. President. Coastal erosion in the Baltic Sea. "
42862,bartlet,"Well, the problem is our UAV's have a self-detonating capability and our people know  how to disarm it, and I wouldn't want to put your guys at risk."
42863,bartlet,"It's proprietary technology, Peter."
42864,bartlet,I know it seems...
42865,bartlet,"Yes, Mr. President."
42866,bartlet,This isn't working anymore.
42867,c.j.,"Just the dealer. Four, no help. Six, possible straight. Heart, possible flush. Jack, no  help. And the Dave of Love for a pair of tens. Tens bet."
42868,c.j.,Am I?
42869,toby,Yes.
42870,c.j.,"That's 'cause I've got faith there, mi compadre. "
42871,toby,Faith?
42872,c.j.,The substance of things hoped for and the evidence of things not seen.
42873,toby,"Yeah, but I think what he's asking... Bump ten... I think what he's asking is why most  other nights do you think the world's going to hell in a hula hoop, but tonight...?"
42874,c.j.,We dipped twice and eat gefilte fish?
42875,toby,"Suzy Cream Cheese, do not attempt the hagaddah."
42876,c.j.,I know how to bless the soup too. I'll raise your raise.
42877,c.j.,Just the two of us.
42878,toby,Faith in what?
42879,c.j.,In us.
42880,toby,The people in this room?
42881,c.j.,"And many, many, many others."
42883,toby,What's in Cheyenne?
42885,toby,What happened?
42887,toby,What happened?
42889,toby,Outer space.
42891,toby,What the hell happened?
42893,toby,From North Korea.
42895,toby,Why do we think at this point that North Korea is attacking the East Coast of the  United States?
42897,toby,I would think.
42899,toby,What's in New London?
42901,toby,The gum?
42903,toby,"Fifty Minutemen they're arming, and is anyone saying this doesn't make sense?"
42905,toby,And they're sending in a team of lawyers to look into it.
42907,toby," A meteor fell from the sky the result being two guys are going to get court- marshalled. The only two guys who apparently thought it was strange that North Korea  would attack submarines in Connecticut instead of say, San Diego or Hawaii. And if it  had been a real attack? Would they still have been doing point/counterpoint with NORAD? "
42908,toby,We failed both on a mechanical and human level. So tell me again what you have faith in.
42909,c.j.,Us. 
42910,toby,Why.
42911,c.j.,"Because with what little free time he has, Will is going to Wyoming to defend one of  these guys and I don't think it is failing on a human level."
42912,toby, I've got ace high flush. Give me your money.
42913,c.j.,I've got tens full of queens. Give me yours. 
42915,bartlet,Peter...
42916,bartlet,"I understand. I meant...  I wasn't referring to the change in weather, sir."
42917,leo," It's Leo again. The UAV's are designed to fly below military radar  simply because the closer we get, the better the pictures. "
42918,leo,Coastal erosion in the Baltic...
42919,leo,Sir.
42920,bartlet,Don't do that Peter.
42921,leo,"You shouldn't do that, sir. We weren't flying in your airspace."
42922,leo,"Well, they're going to see it because in five minutes I'm going to tell the President  to blow it up."
42923,bartlet,We were taking pictures of Kaliningrad.
42924,bartlet,"We were taking pictures of Kaliningrad. We take pictures of black market nuclear materials  being moved out the back doors of suppositories and into trucks. The materials are being  sold to non-governmental elements and, well, that's what we were doing. Rogue engineers,  military scientists, and ex-KGB. It's just as big of a problem for you as it is for us,  but you're not dealing with it, so we were taking pictures of Kaliningrad. We're going to  have to trust each other a little Peter. So we're going to share the pictures we got. Not  the technology we used to get them. Otherwise I'm detonating it and neither of us see the  pictures. We're going to have to trust each other. Our two countries have stopped the world  from annihilating itself for 60 years because of conversations like this one. Why don't you  talk it over?"
42925,leo,"Good. I'd have said, ""We weren't spying on you, we were spying for you,"" but..."
42926,bartlet,"If he calls back we'll have a deal. In the mean time, one hand. Bring your wallet."
42927,josh, Excuse me.
42929,josh,Did you just come by to look at him?
42931,josh,You called him?
42933,josh,I told you I wasn't going to call him.
42935,josh,"I didn't... I'm telling you, there's something. A guy this qualified, I'd know who he was.  Something's wrong.  I just figured out what. Come in and say hi."
42936,josh,You've already met Donna.
42938,josh,"It has. We've talked about his name, and New York City Department of Transportation.  Then we talked about inner cities and jobs and minimum wage and public schools and  foreign aid, hitting all the Democrat g-spots. And it wasn't until now that I realized  that there was something I forgot to ask you. Are you a registered Democrat?"
42939,josh,A registered Independent?
42940,josh,Are you registered?
42941,josh,You're a Republican.
42942,josh,Whoa.
42944,josh,It is not fine.
42946,josh,"'Cause if you're a Republican, then you damned well better look like Ainsley Hayes."
42948,josh,You don't want to get a job with your own party?
42949,josh,Why?
42950,josh,Why?
42951,josh,"Oh, no, that's the kind of thing that's got to wind you up in GOP jail for the same  amount of time as..."
42952,josh,Right. Why do you want to work here? Why not the private sector?
42953,josh,You have something lined up?
42954,josh,That's my father's firm. He was a partner there.
42955,josh,They're going to offer you $225 000 a year. Is this your fallback?
42956,josh,Why do you want to work here?
42957,josh,Why haven't you signed the questionnaire?
42958,josh, You lied on it?
42959,josh,Which question?
42960,josh,What'd you do?
42963,josh,You really want to work with us.
42964,josh,You know we got shot at tonight. On a Friday.
42965,josh,All right. I'm recommending you to Leo.
42966,c.j.,Last card for the players.
42967,bartlet,"Hurry it up. They're going to call us back in a second. Debbie, do something."
42968,toby,Fold.
42969,bartlet,Thank you. Is the pastrami from Krupins?
42970,leo,Yes.
42971,bartlet,Tissue paper thin?
42972,leo,Yes.
42973,bartlet, Damn it.
42974,leo,Chigorin?
42975,leo, Nice job.
42977,c.j.,What sites did they send you to?
42979,c.j.,There's no such site.
42981,c.j.,"""This has to be one of the silliest misconceptions around and it never seems to die."" "
42983,c.j.,There are no web sites supporting it?
42985,toby,"And you've got to ask yourself, if no one on the internet wants a piece of this, just  how far from the pack have you strayed?"
42986,c.j., I could have sworn I saw it.
42987,c.j.,I could have sworn.
42988,toby,What's the deal with the guy?
42989,toby, He's not connected to anything?
42991,toby,Have a safe flight.
42992,toby, You headed home?
42993,c.j.,In just a minute.  I'm going to let them know outside  that they lifted the crash. 
42994,toby,See you in the morning.
42995,c.j.," Guys. Hey, you guys?"
42996,bartlet,"Uh, it turns out it has to go to the Secretary of State. There's a law: It's 3-USC-20.  It goes to the Secretary of State. But we'll take care of it."
42997,bartlet,Why did you take a cab?
42998,bartlet,I'm sorry?
42999,bartlet,You know what's in here? 
43000,bartlet,It's okay.
43001,c.j.,Good morning.
43002,c.j.,"Hang on-- before we do anything, happy birthday, Mark. And don't ever say I don't pay  attention to these things."
43003,c.j.,"All right, go ahead and say it, then. What do I care?"
43004,c.j.,"You're talking about Medicare? I don't think he's seen it yet, but I'll find out."
43005,c.j.,He's going to do what he's got to do.
43006,c.j.,"He's going to do what he's got to do, Phil."
43007,c.j.,"I don't know. I know he wants to, but it's still pretty early in the week. I'm going  to go into the office."
43008,c.j.,"Wait, Katie, I'm sorry. You were asking something at the beginning, and I cut you off  to wish Mark a happy birthday. You know, just in case, why don't you come with me--  the rest, I'll see you at 11:00."
43009,c.j.,Hi. We've never met. It's my pleasure.
43010,c.j.,Why is science coming to the White House?
43011,c.j.,Come on in.
43012,c.j.,Only to the extent that I'm aware that it exists. But I can take your question to the  President's science advisor.
43013,c.j., Come here.
43014,c.j.,"I called you back for a single in front of everybody. That costs me. Your question is:  ""Is there life on Mars?"" And ""Is the White House hiding that there's life on Mars?""  And what the hell does this have to do with the Vice President?!"
43015,c.j.,Katerina--
43016,c.j.,That's absurd.
43017,c.j.,"You've got to ask Gish what kind of credible source goes to the science editor with a  story, instead of--"
43018,c.j., I can't imagine that it's true.
43019,c.j.,"Um, I don't know. But I'll find out to the first bunch of questions and, as for ""legal""  and ""not legal,"" that's a matter for the Counsel's Office. Oh, hey, yeah, that's a  matter for the Counsel's Office. I know the right guy to speak to down there. He's  going to fix you right up."
43020,c.j.,"Excuse me. That's a great outfit, Blair."
43021,c.j.,"Yes, he's a Republican, too, Mr. Quincy is."
43022,c.j.,"This is a cool office, Joe."
43023,c.j.,"Got a little window up there near the ceiling that looks out onto the, uh... the...  What do you call it? The..."
43024,c.j.,"Yeah. And, you know, if you hang 'em on that pipe in the corner, late afternoon, you  get your suits pressed right in front of you."
43025,c.j.,"Hey, no, but that's a good idea. Let me show you around."
43026,c.j.,"Joe, I outrank you by, like, 17 rungs, so follow me, would you?"
43027,c.j.,"Come on. It's going to be fun. But if it's not, you should pretend that it is anyway.  You know why?"
43028,c.j.,"Hey, no, but then again, I like how you're thinking."
43029,c.j.,"So, do you know what I'm going to get asked about probably at my first briefing today?  The Department of Agriculture report that'll come out this morning saying that  commodity prices are down six percent this year, and do I suppose the White House  is going to respond to the farmers who are going broke? And I thought, since the  Republicans tore up the farm safety net, you might have a good idea for what I  should say."
43030,c.j.,You're saying it's good that farmers can't sell what they grow for a living wage?
43031,c.j.,"It's good, except, whoa! Those pesky farmers again. Don't worry about it though, 'cause  it's not like there are that many of them. No, wait, I misspoke. Agriculture is this  country's biggest industry."
43032,c.j.,"That was the staircase, okay? What do you want? It was the Dolly Madison staircase."
43033,c.j.,Nobody cares.
43034,c.j.,"Well, this may sound silly, but the science editor from the Washington Post has a  source-- a blind source-- who says that the Vice President personally told him--  the blind source-- that the Vice President interfered to classify a report that a  NASA commision, which he heads, has saying that there's life on Mars. "
43035,c.j.,"Would you find out who broke the law, please?"
43036,c.j.,The farmers are victims of this Republican Congress.
43037,c.j.,"Well argued, though I do hate you and everything you stand for."
43038,c.j.,"I'm the press secretary, Boo-boo. I don't have that kind of time."
43039,c.j.,Yeah.
43040,c.j.,"You speak to the Vice President, Joe. You're his lawyer."
43041,toby,Rex is the dog?
43044,toby,"Well, that family isn't gonna get up the hill 'cause dad's trying to pull the kids, the  camping gear, Rex the dog and what would appear to be his den up K-2 in a Ford Falcon."
43046,toby,Say that again.
43048,toby,You thought that ad was powerful?
43050,toby,Yeah! If I'm watching that ad...
43052,toby,That was for soccer moms?
43054,toby,That?
43056,toby,"Soccer moms recognize a Big 3 hosing when it walks up and introduces itself good as  anyone, and they know it often begins with ""Tell your Congressman America's about  freedom."" And that mom was worried 'cause dad's hauling a yardsale up Kilimanjaro.  And she's thinking, ""Wow, I married an idiot."""
43058,toby,You think it's gonna be effective?
43060,toby,How did the Hollywood types get into this equation?
43062,toby,You think we should run a counter ad.
43064,toby,Saying what?
43066,toby,What do you mean?
43068,toby,We've been sitting here for 20 minutes.
43070,toby,"Well, get one. Have an idea. Don't come in here with half a thing and not be able to--  you know, after you've walked me to the brink and say, ""We've got to do this, it's  important, though I have no earthly idea how."" Like one of those guys who buys a big  new thing but doesn't really know how to get the most out of it!"
43072,toby, Yeah.
43074,toby,Thanks.
43076,toby,No.
43083,josh,What the hell are you doing?
43085,josh,"Well, let me get rid of it."
43087,josh,What?
43089,josh,I'm gonna scare him away.
43091,josh,Why?
43093,josh,I'm not going to hurt him. I'm just...
43095,josh,"In a second he's going to be bothering me, right?"
43098,josh,Why?
43100,josh,No.
43102,josh,"No, we didn't."
43104,josh,Justice didn't call off the investigation. They reached a settlement with Casseon.
43106,josh,"You can work with C.J.'s office to run down the source, I guess, and see what's going on."
43108,josh,Hey.  How's it going so far?
43109,josh,At the beginning I'm going to ask you to give me a quick hit just so you can learn how  to keep the crazy stuff out of his office.
43110,josh,"Why, what do you got?"
43111,josh,"This is two in one day. I just got ""Did the White House interfere with Casseon  anti-trust?""  and sure."
43113,josh,Wait. What did they say we got in exchange for calling off the D.O.J.?
43115,josh,They said that? You weren't just making a joke?
43117,josh,They said that to... Carol said the reporter said that?
43119,josh,"Well, now we go see Leo."
43125,josh,"I don't practice law? I help write the laws, I write the laws, I make the laws,  I am the law."
43127,josh,"Margaret, this is Joe Quincy."
43128,josh,Leo...
43129,leo,What do you need? Quickly. Set a record right now. Make the news.
43130,josh," Okay, Donna just got a question from the  Post... ""Did we..."" I'm sorry, by the way, have you met..."
43131,leo,"Yeah, I met him. What?"
43132,josh," All right, you go first."
43133,leo,What do they think it said?
43134,leo,The Defense Department classified the NASA Commision report.
43135,leo,That report was classified by the Department of Defense.
43136,leo,"Well, I can't tell you that Joe, the report was classified. But I can tell you it was  classified by the Defense Department.  What about you?"
43137,josh,Did we get the Justice Department to call off it's anti-trust investigation with Casseon?
43138,leo,"They didn't call it off, they settled."
43139,josh,"I know, but ask Donna what they bribed us with. Tell him what the Post said we got in  exchange for calling off Justice."
43142,leo,"That was part of the settlement-- 100,000 computers."
43143,josh,"There's a leak. This, Mars, the people... don't even get me started on that 'cause the  stuff I think you still won't tell me. Who knew about the terms with Casseon outside us...  and now them?"
43144,leo,"The President, me and you, Counsel, Counsel at Treasury and Commerce. Two, three guys at  NEC. Hackley, Little, May..."
43145,josh,The Vice President.
43146,leo,Yeah. The Assistant Attorney General for anti-trust. Did we say the...
43147,josh,Sure.
43148,leo,"Fix this, would you please? There's a story out there we're obstructing justice and  another one we're like in a Ray Bradbury barn. These things make me crazy."
43149,josh,"Yes, sir."
43150,leo,Thank you.
43151,josh,Thank you.
43167,toby,"You said I wouldn't even know you were here. Just so you know, I can tell that you are."
43168,toby,Yeah.
43169,toby,'Cause I am.
43170,toby,I don't know.
43171,toby,"I don't know what kind of salad it is. I'm eating a salad, okay? I'm doing it. Do I have  to know the names? There's no difference between them. It's a bowl of weeds. Some of them  have cheese. This isn't the kind with cheese. Does that answer your question? How many  years have you guys been ""Toby, you eat like a teenager. Toby, that's red meat. That's  your second cigar."" Here I am eating a salad, which by the way, you could cover this  thing in barbecue sauce and it would still tastes like the ground, and I'm getting  heckled from the gallery, who wanted to come in here to eat his roast beef sandwich with  ketchup on a kaiser roll and watch the damn tennis on my TV! That's all I'm saying."
43172,toby,"Yes, I'm doing everything I can.  What?"
43173,toby,Yeah. You're the new sawbones.
43174,toby,Damn it. This is Charlie Young.
43175,toby,"Yeah. If Counsel's fine, you just have C.J. Cregg's office put it out."
43176,toby,Did I beat up on them in the notes for the press comments?
43177,toby,What did I say?
43178,toby, They did!
43179,toby,"Joe, did you think I was going to have the Press Secretary, on behalf of the President,  compare a Federal judge to a pistachio nut? The language gets cleaned up on C.J.'s desk."
43180,toby,"You know when you do ten minutes on Helen Baldwin getting a book deal, it's righteous,  but I speak my mind after getting poked with a stick and it's 'cause of Andy!"
43181,toby,"Yeah. You just go that way and then, you know, ask somebody else."
43182,toby,Joe? What's going on?
43183,toby,Make sure you do.
43185,c.j.,"You know what happens with negotiated press leaks? Two-thirds of the press gives us  lousy coverage 'cause they're tweaked that they didn't get the leak, and the other  third... "
43186,c.j.,...doesn't give us better coverage 'cause they... 
43187,c.j.,What was that?
43189,c.j.,"They think they see the reflection in the window, and they think it's another bird."
43192,c.j.,"Sorry, we thought for a second you were a huge bird knocking on the door."
43193,c.j.,"Well, one of them is obsessed with Donna."
43196,c.j.,Donna just did.
43197,c.j.,I wouldn't worry to much about Mars. I gave it to you to give you a hard time.
43198,c.j.,What's the problem?
43199,c.j.,Who?
43200,c.j.,How would a gossip columnist get a hold of a story about the Pentagon?
43201,c.j.,Why?
43202,c.j.,You are wrong.
43203,c.j.,Stu Winkles don't get tips about the White House illegally suppresing reports.
43204,c.j.,You want me to call Stu Winkle?
43205,c.j.,I don't usually make personal calls to gossip columnist.
43206,c.j.,And you won't tell me why?
43207,c.j.,Even if I give you assurances that I already hold you in contempt?
43208,c.j.,Carol! 
43209,c.j.,Would you get me Stu Winkle at the Washington Post?
43210,c.j.,Stu Winkle at the Post.
43211,c.j.,Yes.
43212,c.j.,I know what to say. 
43213,c.j.,Judicial imagination of pistachio nuts. Can't say that to the Fourth Circuit.
43214,c.j.,"Stu, this is C.J. Cregg at the White House. "
43215,c.j.,Stu?
43216,c.j.,"It is, and I saw you have a new column and I think it's terrific and everyone here at  the White House wishes you a lot of luck."
43217,c.j.,Well...
43218,c.j.,Thank you.
43219,c.j.,"Well, I'm a girl on a budget."
43220,c.j.,"No, really."
43221,c.j.,"Stu, I wanted to get you a direct answer to that NASA Commision question that Ralph Gish  and Katie brought me this morning. It was the Defense Department and not the White House  who classified the report. "
43222,c.j.,Stu?
43223,c.j.,"Stu, thank you very much. I'm sorry, I have to go."
43224,c.j.,Carol?
43225,c.j.,"I need to see Josh and Toby, and Joe needs to see the Vice President."
43226,josh,"Good evening, Mr. Vice President."
43227,josh,Sir?
43228,josh,"Mr. Vice President, have you been having an affair with Helen Baldwin while here at  the White House?"
43229,toby,He's asking because...
43230,toby,He's asking because...
43231,c.j.,"Thank you, Mr. Vice Presidnet."
43232,toby,"Thank you, Mr. Vice President."
43233,josh,"Thank you, sir."
43234,josh, I hope I didn't see you smile in there.
43235,c.j.,Josh.
43236,josh,Yeah?
43237,c.j.,You didn't.
43245,toby,"Doesn't really have the feel of high-minded debate, does it?"
43247,toby,Why not?
43249,toby,"But we're not in the trenches. Two bodies of government are debating fuel efficiency at  the highest level. We're not in the trenches. I don't know. I know it's a 15-second spot.  We got to scare them. I just don't feel like doing that tonight. Will, you need to come  with me. I need to tell you what's about to happen."
43250,bartlet,You've talked to Suzanne?
43251,bartlet,You've talked to Suzanne?
43252,leo,What happened?
43253,leo,Tell me again. How many times? When did it start?
43254,leo,"I'll tell you what, Mr. Vice President. For this moment, tonight, I'm going to be in  charge of deciding what matters. 47 phone calls? Did you not know that the White House  keeps records of phone calls? Did you not know that? How many times? When did it start?"
43255,leo,I'm about to read about it in a book.
43256,leo,Didn't it ever occur to you that she might do this?
43257,bartlet,You were wrong.
43258,leo,Do you think there's anyone else behind this?
43259,leo,Do you think she may have been coached by Republican Leadership?
43260,leo,"John, if we are going to weather this, then we're going to have to..."
43261,leo,We will.
43262,bartlet,"If we're going to do this, we got to start tonight, now, and I need you thinking now  and not giving up..."
43263,bartlet,"What about ""It's none of your business?"""
43264,leo,Are you in a position to deny it?
43265,leo,She's made a seven-figure book deal. She's not going to have a lot of credibility.
43266,bartlet,"Apologize and move on. Accept responsibilty. You don't need to disclose details. She's  going to take care of that for you. You're going to be the dinner special for two months,  and then you've got two and half years to get the nomination."
43267,bartlet,"In the middle of MS, it looked like we were never going to recover, and we did."
43268,bartlet,John...
43269,bartlet,"Well, I'm sorry, Mr. Vice President, if my multiple sclerosis was a bummer for your  sex life. How the hell did you do this to us?! You can't resign, John. It's a terrible  signal to send."
43270,bartlet,"Is there more? Is there another shoe, 'cause if it's a series of..."
43271,leo,"You're still going to get dragged through it, sir. It's not going to change anything.  Only now, you're going to be out there alone, with no mechanism or apparatus for a  comeback."
43272,leo,"Which I'm telling you, you can do. You can make it. I can help you."
43273,leo,"You're a giant, John. You're a U.S. Senator, the Vice-President of the United States,  and presumptive nominee of your party. You cannot be taken down by this... cheap person  and her customers huddled around Macy's window waiting for someone to turn themselves  inside out. It's cause for divorce, not resignation. You cannot be taken down by this  cheap person."
43274,bartlet,Didn't you have any sense that this was the kind of person who would do this?
43275,bartlet,"Well, I want you to sleep on it. I want all of us to sleep on it."
43276,bartlet,Why did you take a cab?
43277,bartlet,I'm sorry?
43278,bartlet,You know what's in here? 
43279,bartlet,It's okay.
43280,bartlet,Okay.
43281,bartlet," Yeah, we're going to need a new Vice President."
43282,josh,For Vice President you mean?
43283,josh,For health.
43284,josh,"Yeah. I'm a fan of Lyndell, so is the President, but the Speaker's not, and this guy  has to get confirmed."
43285,josh,He's got an Asian garden in the back of his house where he meditates.
43286,josh,Both of which one would find in an Asian garden.
43287,josh,You buried the champagne at the Arboretum?
43288,josh,How do you get away with digging up the National Arboretum?
43289,josh,"Well, today is the... Today's 5/7. "
43290,josh,You got to get the bottle back.
43291,josh,You do.
43292,josh,"You shoud dig it up, it's a good idea."
43293,josh,"No, I mean, as a friend. You give it to her as a graduation present. You give it to her  at one of the parties tonight. That way she goes off without thinking you're mad at her."
43294,josh,"Yeah, but it's not really her fault, and she's going away for a while. And... anyway, I  don't know what I'm talking about. Let me ask you something. Just between you and me...  and... I'm not looking for this particular promotion, but... just between you and me...  what would you think about this choice?"
43295,josh,See you later.
43296,bartlet,How were they able to rent a van?
43297,bartlet," ""A torrential downpour in the Pacific Northwest."""
43298,bartlet,"""A torrential downpour."""
43299,bartlet,And they're just missing?
43300,bartlet,"The five of them, they're just missing?"
43301,bartlet,We're going to work on that?
43302,bartlet,Threat Con Bravo. Find them. Threat Con Bravo. Leo and I will be back.
43306,c.j.,Good morning.
43307,toby,Good morning.
43308,c.j.,Big day.
43309,toby,Yes.
43310,c.j.,Are you nervous?
43311,toby,How do you know about this?
43312,c.j.,The house?
43313,toby,Yeah.
43314,c.j.,Not because you told me.
43315,toby,That's right.
43317,c.j.,Hey.
43318,toby,Hey.
43320,toby,It's not going to be about commencement.
43322,toby,'Cause he's not going to call the four of us in Saturday morning at 8:00 to work on a  commencement speech.
43324,toby,I'm choosing to be nervous about other things today.
43326,toby,Is he taking about the house?
43328,toby, They know about the house!
43329,josh,Did you tell them?
43330,toby,No. Did you?
43331,josh,"It's a bold, romantic gesture. I spread it around, got you some good will. I think I  turned some people around on you."
43332,leo,Go ahead and sit down. He's going to be a second. How you doing?
43333,toby,Good.
43334,leo,"What is it, two weeks?"
43335,toby,"In ten days, we can pick a day on the calendar and they'll induce."
43336,leo,You can pick a day?
43337,toby,Yeah.
43338,leo,"That's great, so you can do it on a Friday, let the kids get their feet wet over the  weekend."
43339,toby,Yeah.
43340,leo,Let me tell you something... you know what I'd do? I'd check into the hospital today.  You can't do it too soon. Mallory was very nearly born at Exit 322 on the Long Island  Expressway.
43341,bartlet, Thanks. 
43342,bartlet,"Yeah, listen, I don't think this is going to come as a galloping shock to anyone here,  but last May I ordered a Special Ops unit to kill Abdul Shareef, and that's what they  did, and we we made it look like what got reported."
43343,leo,Anybody need him to stop?
43344,josh,"No, sir."
43345,leo,Anybody need a minute?
43346,toby,"No, sir."
43347,c.j.,"No, sir."
43348,leo,"There was considerable evidence presented to a group that included Fitzwallace, Nancy,  Berryhill, Babish, the Attorney General and a few others. We gave it to the gang of  eight. The man had committed crimes and remained a threat. For instance, we stopped  him from blowing up the Golden Gate Bridge. Were U.S. laws broken? No. International  law? Possibly."
43349,bartlet,"See, I said we took Shareef, and they said fine, and then you went on talking for  another five, ten minutes."
43350,c.j.,Mr. President...
43351,bartlet,Yes?
43352,c.j.,Why the decision to tell us this morning?
43353,bartlet,"Well, I just ordered Threat Con Bravo, so people are going to be seeing some heightened  security this weekend."
43354,c.j.,What's the threat?
43355,leo,Increased chatter about torrential rain in the Pacific Northwest. It's pouring rain  in the Pacific Northwest.
43357,leo,For a couple of years we've been keeping an eye on five possible Bahji sleepers in  Central New York. And last night they disappeared. We lost them.
43358,josh,We lost them?
43359,bartlet,We did.
43360,josh,And we're worried about retribution for Shareef?
43361,leo,Yes.
43362,josh,"Can I ask, how hard can it be to keep an eye on five Qumari religious fanatics in  Schenectady?"
43363,bartlet,"Tell him, sister."
43364,leo,I think you'd both be surprised. Anything else?
43366,leo,Thank you.
43367,c.j.,"Thank you, Mr. President."
43368,toby,"Thank you, sir."
43369,bartlet,"Oh, hey, Toby, big day."
43370,bartlet,"The house, a masterstroke. Come on, give us a kiss."
43371,toby,"Thank you, no, sir."
43372,bartlet,Okay.
43373,bartlet,Yes?
43375,bartlet,"No, I don't need help."
43377,bartlet,Yeah... I need help.
43379,bartlet,What I have?
43381,bartlet,"Well, it's been said that I have a pleasant speaking voice and oratorical style."
43383,bartlet,On paper?
43385,bartlet,No.
43387,bartlet,Yeah.
43389,bartlet,"Yeah, right away I would think."
43391,bartlet,"Except at this minute, I have to go over and meet the agents who are beening detailed  to Zoey for France. They speak French. As well as being secret service agents. I didn't  mean they speak French and so therefore are guarding Zoey in France."
43393,bartlet,"I have been thinking that I'd like to talk about creativity. Why don't you get started  on some thoughts, and I'll join you."
43395,josh,Wesley.
43396,josh,You back?
43397,josh,Really?
43398,josh,"It's a bit of a powder-puff detail there, isn't it, fella?"
43399,josh,"So, in your training, what were you taught to do if, say a stringer for Town and Country  were to get in her face?"
43400,josh,"Oh, yeah."
43401,bartlet,Hi.
43402,bartlet,Are you friends of Zoey's?
43403,bartlet,Hey.
43404,bartlet,"Wes, thanks so much for doing this. I know it's not what you like."
43405,bartlet,"So, let's talk about how this is going to work."
43406,bartlet,"Well, here's my question. These guys look pretty young to me, and I'm looking for  something very specific with this detail. This is a father-daughter situation, and  so what I think I'm looking for in terms of protection would best be categorized as,  well, overwhelming force. Do they have that? Do they have the ability to just overwhelm  any danger that might...? Do you have overwh...? Do they have overwhelming force?"
43407,bartlet,Wow!
43408,bartlet,This one here tossed Wesley like a bag of potato chips.
43409,bartlet,You guys know each other?
43410,bartlet,"Oh, good. Okay. Well, Ellie's still up and running."
43411,bartlet,When do you start?
43412,bartlet, Are you going back to the campus?
43413,bartlet,"Okay, well, let me ask you this. Would you consider instead of living in France with  your boyfriend for three months, staying here, living in your room, being a candy  striper, or surfer?"
43414,bartlet,"Or surfing? You could spend the summer working in a pet shop. We could play Yahtzee,  and watch movies at night."
43415,bartlet,What daughters would do their whole lives if I had my way.
43416,bartlet," Before I forget, if something comes up and you're faced with the choice  of killing the boyfriend or not killing the boyfriend -- kill the boyfriend."
43417,leo,"Excuse me, sir."
43418,bartlet, Excuse me.
43419,leo,"Harbor Patrol in Portland is reporting that the Agile, a cargo ship in port for 14  hours now, has a container missing. They're supposed to have 46. They have 45."
43420,bartlet,What's the registry?
43421,bartlet,What are we doing on the ground?
43422,bartlet,How long have they been at it?
43423,bartlet,"All right, let's give them another hour. Then have the Coast Gurad close the port.  Is it the port of Portland? Is it really the port of Portland?"
43424,leo,Yeah.
43425,bartlet,They're going to lose $700 million a day 'cause these five guys are missing. And I  just now got why we're having this meeting.
43426,leo,What do you mean?
43427,bartlet,Portland. Torrential rain in the Pacific Northwest.
43428,leo,Yeah.
43429,bartlet,Screw the hour. Let's close it down.
43430,bartlet,Thanks.
43431,leo,Hey... did you know that ten days from now Toby and Andy can pick a day and the doctor's  going to induce. Thay can decide what day the twins are going to be born.
43432,bartlet,"Well, it's about the last thing they're going to get to decide. So you choose Tuesday.  20 years later, look what happens."
43433,c.j.,You scared me!
43434,c.j.,What are you doing in here?
43435,c.j.,Carol!
43436,c.j.,Can I help you?
43437,c.j.,Can I help you?!
43438,c.j.,"Danny, you want to go home for a while and then talk to me?"
43439,c.j.,What?
43440,c.j.,We'll comment as soon as you show me the link.
43441,c.j.,You've been saying that from the beginning.
43442,c.j.,We'll show it to me and I'll comment on it.
43443,c.j.,"Well, you are not going to run it like this. There are national security issues involved."
43444,c.j.,There are.
43445,c.j.,Classified security information? I don't think I'm allowed to do that.
43446,c.j.,Don't run it. Not this weekend. I'm not lying to you about security concerns.
43447,c.j.,"Of course, I have."
43448,c.j.,I extend you courtesy all the time.
43449,c.j.,You just slept on my couch.
43450,c.j.,"All right, you'll give me a couple of hours."
43451,toby,All right. Careful stepping out.  There's a street right  there. And there you go.
43452,toby,"Well... I hadn't actually factored that into the plan, but if you'll just come over here.   And... there you go. Go ahead."
43453,toby,Yeah.
43454,toby,Everytime we drive past you say that it's your dream house.
43455,toby,"And every time the Congressman's had us over, you've said it was your dream house."
43456,toby,"You told Jeff Wyler that if he ever put it on he market, you wanted to buy it."
43457,toby,"Well, as it turns out, he was going to put it on the market, but he's not anymore  'cause I bought it."
43458,toby,Yeah.
43459,toby,"Yeah, I did."
43460,toby,"Well, I put together some money for the down payment by selling my soul."
43461,toby,"Well, as a matter of fact, it'll... "
43462,toby,...it'll be your house if... if... if you say yes to this.
43463,toby,Um... will you marry me?
43464,toby,"No, no. I mean..."
43465,toby,If we could just get back to the original question.
43466,toby,You're saying no?
43467,toby,I don't think you've noticed the things I've done to alter the behavior that's troubled  you in the past. Giving up what you felt was a bachelor apartment is only the most recent  of gestures which included eating salads.
43468,toby,Then why aren't you remarrying me?
43469,toby,"Yeah, I do. I thought you were just being cute. I just thought you were making me  chase you as a punishment for the first marriage, and that was okay with me."
43470,toby,Why?
43471,toby,What?
43472,toby,I'm not sad.
43473,toby,I'm not sad. I take things seriously.
43474,toby,I'm not comparing myself to anyone. I'm saying...
43475,toby,"Well... My father used to kill people for a living, so, generationally, the Zieglers  are making lots of progress. I wouldn't worry about the kids."
43476,toby,Don't.
43477,toby,Wouldn't it be ironic if our kids were the only ones who were properly prepared?
43478,toby,"Great! Half full, half empty? Can we at least agree it's not full yet?"
43479,toby,That was a joke!
43480,toby,Did you feel this way when we were married?
43481,toby,"I mean, it's not just now?"
43482,toby,Really. Hmm. Did you feel this way when we were married? That I was sad?
43483,toby,Did my friends feel like that?
43484,toby,Okay.
43492,bartlet,Good! You're here! I want to make some changes.
43494,bartlet,Look at you. There is no way you have three adult children.
43496,bartlet,"I do, but the neck..."
43498,bartlet,"Eh, it seems empty to me. Attention should be drawn to it."
43500,bartlet,"Nice job with the, you know, raising of the kid."
43502,bartlet,"They're real, too. They can cut glass."
43504,bartlet,"Aw, damn it, what are these, then?"
43506,bartlet,Yeah. Get in the car. We'll do it on the fly.
43508,bartlet,Get in the car...
43510,bartlet,"Small ones-- instead of talking about the internal muse, I want to talk about the limits  of reason, and about passion and intuition in American life."
43512,bartlet,"You can eat them, too. They're gumballs. Coop?"
43514,bartlet,Yes. Let's think.
43515,leo,Look...
43516,leo,It's a good pen.
43517,leo,It's not just a pen.
43518,leo,No. I meant it's a really good pen.
43519,c.j.,He's meeting us in the upper press room.
43520,leo,He said his link was the pilot.
43521,c.j.,Yeah. You know what he has?
43522,leo,"Well, Shareef's pilot, who died in the crash, was Jamil Bari, who had a Qumai passport  and is alive and American, and not named Jamil Bari, so he could have any number of  things."
43523,c.j.,"Man, the things we can do."
43524,leo,Yeah.
43525,c.j.,You're giving Zoey a pen?
43526,leo,Yeah.
43527,c.j.,Does it do anything?
43528,leo,"Danny, C.J.'s going to talk to you for a second, and then you and I are going to work  together. "
43529,leo,Danny?
43530,c.j.,He's asleep.
43531,leo,What are you talking about?
43532,c.j.,He was in Augsburg. He hasn't slept yet.
43533,leo,So here's the national security threat.
43534,c.j.,Wake up.
43535,leo,Good for you. Follow me.
43536,c.j.,We're at Threat Condition Bravo right now.
43537,c.j., Why?
43538,leo,'Cause five Bahji sleepers we were watching disappeared.
43539,leo,"Yeah. And it coincides with increased chatter we're hearing. You print we did this  right now, and I'm worried what the five guys are going to do."
43540,leo,Done.
43541,c.j.,Thank you.
43542,leo,So you found the pilot?
43543,leo,In Augsburg.
43544,leo,The things we can do.
43549,toby, Is she going to be able to get the epidural?
43550,toby,"And when you say ""right now,"" what do you mean?"
43551,toby,"No, don't. What... what are you talking about? D-don't worry about it."
43552,toby,Bite my hand when it hurts.
43553,bartlet,What do you think about using the Eudora Welty quote instead of the Gandhi?
43555,bartlet,"""You must be the change"" - is that it? ""You must be the change you wish to see in the  world."" Sounds too much like Eastern philosophy."
43557,bartlet,'Cause Ghandi lived in India?
43559,bartlet,"Well, let's write that one."
43560,bartlet,Yeah.
43561,bartlet,"Yeah. Thanks, Will, for the help."
43563,bartlet,Thank you!
43564,bartlet,"Yeah, no. I've got it down here in this folder, and on some napkins in my pocket."
43565,bartlet,"Oh, yeah, I'll be fine. You know, unless something comes up."
43566,bartlet,"Well, for instance, I just realized I don't have access to my pockets anymore. But,  you know, what are you going to do?"
43573,josh,Charlie?
43574,josh,"I need you to tell me now that you have some sense of where were going and that we're  not... you know, spending the night here. That were not making camp."
43575,josh,"Yeah, but didn't I almost immediately take it back?"
43576,josh,You sure?
43577,josh,It's pretty dark. Ohh!
43578,josh,"Yeah, we're in a brook now."
43579,josh,"It's like I'm in 'Nam, basically. I'm in a rice paddy."
43580,josh,"Josh Lyman. I'm with him. I'm going to stay here, though, 'cause you know..."
43581,leo,What are the rules in questioning foreign nationals?
43582,leo,What's the well-light room for?
43583,leo,All right. Let's go around the table one last time. Where are we with this? What kind  of day has it been?
43590,c.j.,Danny?
43591,c.j.,What are you doing here? Why aren't you asleep?
43592,c.j.,"Well, what are you writing?"
43593,c.j.,"Three days, Daniel."
43594,c.j.,"The President's speech was good this afternoon, didn't you think?"
43595,c.j.,"Yeah, that was a troubling moment, but he had to get his napkins."
43596,c.j.,Madras research project. That's what we'll call it for a few days.
43600,josh,"We scaled the wall, we didn't hop it. It was like 30 feet tall. It was like a castle  gate. We took it. Buzzards, wilderness life everywhere."
43604,c.j.,I don't want to write anything down right now.
43605,c.j.,"I don't know, but the answer to the last two questions will be the same."
43606,c.j.,There was an NSC decision directive.
43607,c.j.,That was four. What was the fifth?
43608,josh,"It's true that you adapt to the terrain. Of course after a little while I just said  to hell with it, took my pants off."
43609,leo,"Well, if it turns out we closed the Port of Portland because of a typo, it's only  going to fuel Margaret's insanity. I'm going to go home for a few hours. Call me if  something happens."
43610,leo,Ron?
43611,leo,What happened?
