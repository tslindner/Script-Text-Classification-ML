41,Fry,My God! A million years!,7
42,Leela,I'm sure this must be very upsetting for you.,7
43,Fry,"Y'know, I guess it should be but, actually, I'm glad. I had nothing to live for in my old life. I was broke, I had a humiliating job and I was beginning to suspect my girlfriend might be cheating on me.",7

84,Ipgee,"This is unacceptable, Leela. You must find this Mr. Fry and install his chip.",12
85,Leela,"Look, he's just a nobody who doesn't want to be a delivery boy. I'd really rather not force it on him.",12

88,Bender,"I don't need to drink, I can quit anytime I want!  So they made you a delivery boy, huh? Man, that's as bad as my job.",13
89,Fry,"Really? What do you do, Bender?",13
90,Bender,"I'm a bender. I bend girders, that's all I'm programmed to do.",13

126,Bender,"Oh, we're trapped!",15
127,Fry,"Wait a second. You're a bender, right? We can get out of here if you just bend the bars.",15
128,Bender,"Dream on, skin tube. I'm only programmed to bend for constructive purposes. What do I look like, a de-bender?",15
129,Fry,Who cares what you're programmed for. If someone programmed you to jump off a bridge would you do it?,15
130,Bender,I'll have to check my program ... yep.,15
131,Leela,Open up!,15
132,Fry,"C'mon, Bender! It's up to you to make your own decisions in life. That's what separates people and robots from animals ... and animal robots.",15

147,Fry,This is where I brought my girlfriend on our very first date.,16

152,Fry,"No, you don't. I've got no home, no family--",16
153,Bender,No friends.,16
154,Fry,My whole world is gone. You can't possibly understand what it feels like to be so alone.,16
155,Leela,I understand. I'm the only one-eyed alien on this whole planet. My parents abandoned me here as a baby and I don't even know what galaxy they were from. I know how it feels to be alone.,16
156,Fry,"Look, Leela, I don't understand this world but you obviously do, so I give up. If you really think I should be a delivery boy, I'll do it.  Your chip. What are you doing?",16
157,Leela,Quitting.,16
158,Fry,Why?,16
159,Leela,Because I've always wanted to. I just never realised it before I met you.,16
160,Fry,What is the matter with you?,16
161,Bender,I just wanted to be part of the moment.,16
162,Leela,Hey! He stole my ring!,16
163,Bender,"Sorry.  Well, that solves the mystery of the missing ring. This calls for a drink.",16

174,Farnsworth,Let me show you around. That's my lab table and this is my work-stool. And over there is my intergalactic spaceship!  And here's where I keep assorted lengths of wire.,19
175,Fry,Whoa! A real live spaceship!,19
176,Farnsworth,I designed it myself. Let me show you some of the different lengths of wire I used.,19

200,Fry,"So, I guess, without jobs, we'll be fugitives forever.",20
201,Farnsworth,"Not necessarily. Are you three, by any chance, interested in becoming my new spaceship crew?",20
202,Bender,New crew? W-What happened to the old crew?,20
203,Farnsworth,Of those poor sons of-- But that's not important. The important thing is I need a new crew. Anyone interested?,20
204,Fry,Yes! Yes! That's exactly the job I've always wanted!,20
205,Leela,"Thanks for the offer, Professor, but we don't have the proper career chips.",20
206,Farnsworth,"Oh, that won't be a problem. As luck would have it, I saved the chips from my previous crew.",20
207,Fry,This is awesome! Are we gonna fly through space fighting monsters and teaching alien women to lurve?,20
208,Farnsworth,"If by that you mean ""transporting cargo"" then yes. It's a little home business I started to fund my research.",20
209,Fry,Cool! What's my job gonna be?,20
210,Farnsworth,You will be responsible for ensuring that the cargo reaches its destination.,20
211,Fry,"So, I'm gonna be a delivery boy?",20
212,Farnsworth,Exactly!,20
213,Fry,Alright! I'm a delivery boy!,20
214,Farnsworth,"As new employees, I'd like your opinion on our commercial. I paid to have it air during the Super Bowl.",21
215,Fry,Wow!,21

217,Announcer,Interplanetary deliveries - what a headache!,21
218,Horrible Gelatinous Blob,Evans! Where's that package from Earth?,21
219,Man,I'm not Evans!,21
220,Horrible Gelatinous Blob,He should've used Planet Express!,21
221,Announcer,"When those other companies aren't brave or foolhardy enough to go, trust Planet Express for reliable, on time delivery.",21

227,Farnsworth,"No, no! That was all just special effects! Now let's have breakfast. I hope everyone likes eggs.",21
228,Fry,I'm never going to get used to the 31st century.  Caffinated bacon? Baconated grapefruit? Admiral Crunch?,22

230,Farnsworth,"Ah, Hermes! Crew, meet Hermes Conrad. He manages my delivery business, pays the bills, notifies next of kin, what have you.",22
231,Hermes,Someone come and dropped this package through the slot last night. Now which one of you is the captain?,22
232,Farnsworth,"Oh, my! I haven't picked a new captain yet. It's always so hard to choose.",22
233,Fry,"Ooh! Ooh, ooh, ooh!",22
234,Farnsworth,"Hmm, you!",22
235,Hermes,"OK, Captain, this is just a standard legal release protecting Planet Express from lawsuits in the event of the unforeseen.",23

237,Hermes,Mm.,23
238,Leela,Death by brain parasite.,23
239,Hermes,Yeah.,23
240,Leela,Death by sonic diarrhoea?,23

243,Hermes,Sign the paper!,23
244,Farnsworth,"Now, Fry, before you go into space you'll need to see our staff doctor. I should warn you though, he's a little ... unusual.  He wears sandals!",24
245,Fry,Hi--,24
246,Farnsworth,"Dr. Zoidberg, this is Fry, the new delivery boy. He needs a physical.",24
247,Zoidberg,"Excellent, excellent!",24

251,Zoidberg,Really?,24
252,Fry,"Uh, is there a human doctor around?",24
253,Zoidberg,"Young lady, I'm an expert on humans. Now pick a mouth, open it and say...  What? My mother was a saint! Get out!",24

256,Farnsworth,"Amy, why don't you give his body a going over with the cleaning pick?",25
257,Amy,OK. Does it hurt when I go like this?,25
258,Leela,Ow!,25
259,Bender,A little.,25
260,Fry,"Well, the doctor says I'm as healthy as a crab. Can I go into space now?",25
261,Farnsworth,"As soon as we finish cleaning Bender. Oh, and Fry, this is our intern, Amy Wong. She's an engineering student of mine.  I like having her around because she's the same blood type as me.",25
262,Amy,"Hey! You're the unfrozen guy! From the 20th century, right?",25
263,Fry,Last time I checked.,25
264,Leela,Hang on. Amy Wong? Of the Mars Wongs?,25

275,Amy,"Oh, I love stuff like the moon! Can I come, Leela?",26
276,Leela,Well ... I guess so. Just be careful. I'd like to hold off any major screw-ups until at least my second day as captain.,26
277,Farnsworth,"Nothing will go wrong.  If something goes wrong, bring back the blood.",26

296,Fry,I had more but you go ahead.,28
297,Leela,We'll deliver that crate like professionals and then we'll go home.,28
298,Fry,But I've never been to the moon before.,28
299,Leela,"Alright. We'll deliver that crate like professionals ... and then we'll go ride the bumper cars.  Amy, why don't you help Fry hoist down the crate. Then lock up when you're done. Just be careful.",28

336,Fry,Finally! Get ready for some serious moon action.,35
337,Narrator,The story of lunar exploration started with one man. A man with a dream.,35
338,Ralph Kramden-bot,"One of these days, Alice. Bang! Zoom! Straight to the moon!",35
339,Leela,"Wow, I never realised the first astronauts were so fat!",35
340,Fry,"That's not an astronaut, it's a TV comedian. And he was just using space travel as a metaphor for beating his wife.",35
341,Amy,Wow! I could swear I was really playing virtual skeeball!  Hm?,36
342,Bender,"Look, it's that crate we were gonna throw in the sewer.",36
343,Amy,The keys to the ship!  They must have fallen into the crate! Leela's gonna kill me!,36
344,Bender,Nah. She'll probably make me do it.,36
345,Amy,Mister? Could you please get those keys out for me?,36
346,Sal,What do I look like? A guy who's not lazy?,36
347,Narrator,"No one knows where, when or how Man first landed on the moon.",37
348,Fry,I do.,37
349,Narrator,But our fun-gineers think it might have happened something like this,37
350,Whalerbots,"We're whalers on the moon,",37
351,Gophers,"We carry a harpoon,",37
352,Whalerbots,and   But there ain't no whales so we tell a tall tale...,37
353,Leela,And sing a whaling tune. We're whalers on the moon--,37
354,Fry,That's not how it happened.,37
355,Leela,"Oh, really? I don't see you with a fun-gineering degree!",37
356,Fry,This is stupid. I'm taking this thing out to the real moon.,37
357,Leela,"Fry, no. This is my first mission and I'm not gonna let us get in any trouble. Besides, the car's on a track.",37
358,Fry,Not for long!,37
359,Whalerbot,Ooh! Ah! I died doin' what I loved.,37
360,Leela,"OK, you're on the surface. Now I'll give you 10 minutes. Then you'll get bored, turn around and apologise for being such a jerk. Agreed?",37
361,Fry,Agreed.  Yeah! Crank up the radio!,37
362,Whalerbots,We're whalers on the--,37
363,Fry,Yee-haw!,37
364,Leela,Time's up. Make a U-turn at the next crater.,37
365,Fry,"No, not yet. How 'bout we go look for the original moon landing site?",37
366,Leela,That's crazy! It's been lost for centuries!,37
367,Fry,Well I'm feelin' lucky!  Uh ... I'm ready to go back now.,37
368,Fry,We're gonna die! It's every man for himself!  You did it! We're safe!,37
369,Leela,No. Now we're gonna die.,37
370,Fry,It's every man for himself.,37
371,Bender,"Hey, look what I won from a tourist's pocket!",38
372,Amy,Shut up. You're distracting me.,38
373,Bender,"Come on, it's just like making love. Y'know",38
374,Amy,I know how to make love!,38
375,Bender,"Here, let me do it.  Uh, that's the woman who programmed me for evil!",38
376,Bender,"Yeah, well, I'm gonna go build my own theme park, with blackjack and hookers. In fact, forget the park!",38
377,Fry,"I'm sorry, Leela, I can't go on any further. Just leave me to die in that barn over there.",39
378,Leela,Thank God!,39
379,Hydroponic Farmer,"Trespassers, eh?",39
380,Fry,"No, sir. We're amusement park patrons.",39
381,Farmer,"Ooh, that's a wicked sinful place. Tilt-a-whirl's OK, but the rest is mighty wicked.",39
382,Leela,Our car broke down and we're out of oxygen. Can we borrow some?,39
383,Farmer,"Huh, borry? Looky here, city girl, oxygen don't grow on trees. You'll have to earn it doing chores on my hydroponic farm. You can go back to your precious theme park at sun up.",39
384,Fry,I guess we could do chores for a few hours.,39
385,Leela,"Fry, night lasts two weeks on the moon.",39
386,Farmer,Yup. Drops down to -173!,39
387,Fry,Fahrenheit or Celsius?,39
388,Farmer,"First one, then th'other. And them spacesuits ain't a-heated so you ain't goin' nowhere till sunrise. You can sleep in the barn. Just don't be a-touchin' my three beautiful robot daughters. Y'hear?",39
389,Fry,Robot daughters?,39
390,Farmer,This here is Lulabelle 7.,39
391,Lulabelle 7,Yoo-hoo!,39
392,Farmer,Daisy-Mae 128K.,39
393,Daisy-Mae 128K,Yoo-hoo!,39
394,Farmer,And the Crushinator.,39
395,Crushinator,Yoo-hoo.,39
396,Fry,Whoa!,39
397,Leela,"I told you to turn around and go back to the park. But oh, no, the park was too phoney. We had to see the real moon.",40
398,Fry,And it was great! We got to see craters and rocks and that one incredible rock that looked like a crater and ... and these fellas.,40
399,Leela,"Fry, face it",40
400,Fry,I guess I can't.,40
401,Farmer,I'll learn ye to sleep with my robot daughters!,40
402,Bender,He'll never find me in here.,40
403,Leela,Bender?,40
404,Fry,"Oh, Bender. You didn't touch the Crushinator, did you?",40
405,Bender,Of course not. A lady that fine you gotta romance first.,40
406,Farmer,"Oh, no you don't! C'mere, Crushinator.",40
407,Crushinator,"Yes, Pa.",40
408,Fry,It's too low.,40
409,Leela,Hang on. Hang on. Jump!  Hold on to your helmet!,40
410,Farmer,"God darn it, Crushinator, jump!",40
411,Crushinator,"No, Pa. I love him.",40
412,Fry,"Hey, cool! Dark side of the moon!",40
413,Leela,"Nightfall's coming.  Hurry, before we freeze.",40
414,Bender,"What do you mean ""we"", mammal?",40
415,Farnsworth,"Oh, dear! I really ought to do something. But I am already in my pyjamas.",40
416,Leela,We can't outrun it forever.,40
417,Fry,Over there! Look! It's the moon landing site! We found it!,40
418,Leela,"Quick, get in.",40
419,Fry,"It's that flag from MTV! And Neil Armstrong's footprint!  Hey! My foot's bigger! Leela, isn't this the greatest thing you've ever seen?",40
420,Leela,"Fry, look around. It's just a crummy plastic flag and a dead man's tracks in the dust.  Now get in here before you freeze.",40
421,Bender,"Oh, no room for Bender, huh? Fine! I'll go build my own lunar lander, with blackjack and hookers. In fact, forget the lunar lander and the blackjack. Ah, screw the whole thing.",40
422,Leela,Well if the oxygen holds out we might live long enough to starve to death.,41
423,Fry,"Look, Leela, I'm sorry. I never should have dragged you out here.",41
424,Leela,"That's right, you shouldn't have. I still don't get what the big attraction is.",41
425,Fry,I never told anybody this but a thousand years ago I used to look up at the moon and dream about being an astronaut. I just didn't have the grades. Nor the physical endurance. Plus I threw up a lot and nobody liked spending a week with me.,41
426,Leela,A week would be a little much.,41
427,Fry,"The moon was like this awesome, romantic, mysterious thing, hanging up there in the sky where you could never reach it, no matter how much you wanted to.  But you're right. Once you're actually here it's just a big dull rock. I guess I just wanted you to see it through my eyes, the way I used to.",41
428,Leela,"Fry, look. . It really is beautiful. I don't know why I never noticed before.",41
429,Farmer,"Had to come back for the Crushinator, eh, robot? Well I got you this time.",41
430,Fry,It's Amy! We're saved!,41
431,Leela,Amy? Where'd she learn to operate the controls like that?,41
432,Bender,Not the magnet! No! No! No--  Uh-oh!,41
433,Bender,"She'll be comin' round the mountain,She'll be comin' round the mountain,She'll be comin'--",41
434,Farmer,"Aw, dang it!",41
435,Bender,She'll be riding six white horses...,41
436,Leela,"So, Fry, was the real moon anything like the moon you used to dream about?",41
437,Fry,Well ... close enough!,41
438,Bender,One more time!,41
439,Bender,Hey!,42
440,Hermes,"Fry, mon, if you're going to be living in the office you could at least be on time for work.",42
441,Fry,I'm sorry. I was up really late poking through people's desks.,42
442,Hermes,"Alright, people. I will now outline today's 12-point agenda. We'll begin with point one, then race forward--",42
443,Hermes,Concerning our pest problem,42
444,Leela,What the hell are you doing? You're getting a huge dose of radiation!,42
445,Fry,And great lift!,42
446,Leela,Do you know how long it's going to take me to recalibrate these engines?,42
447,Fry,"Hey! When you look this good, you don't have to know anything.",42
448,Leela,"Professor, We need to talk to you about Fry.",43
449,Bender,"That's right, we want some money— Wait. What's this about Fry?",43
450,Leela,He's a nice guy but we think it's about time he got his own place.,43
451,Farnsworth,"Oh, fuff! He's not causing any trouble. Now, if you don't mind, I'm rather busy. I seem to have mislaid my alien mummy.  This sarcophagus should contain the remains of Emperor Nimballa, who ruled Zuban 5 over 29 million years ago.",43
452,Fry,"Hey, Professor, great jerky!",43
453,Farnsworth,"My God, this is an outrage! I was going to eat that mummy! Fry has got to go!",43
454,Announcer,"Bachelor Chow, now with flavour!",44
455,Commentator,And Bigfoot is down!,44
456,Fry,"Sheesh! 40,000 channels and only 150 have anything good on.",44
457,Announcer,All My Circuits is brought to you by Robo Fresh,44
458,Calculon,"I've been processing this for some time, Monique, and, well, will you marry me?",44
459,Monique,It fits! Then you must know that I'm--,44
460,Calculon,"Metric? I've always known. But for you, my darling, I'm willing to convert.",44
461,Fry,"Hmm, must be a friend of theirs.",44
462,Bender,"Fry, we've got to discuss your living arrangements.",44
463,Leela,We've all talked it over and--,44
464,Bender,"Hey, All My Circuits! Move over.",44
465,Leela,"Fry, sometimes in close quarters, people do inconsiderate things without realising it.",44
466,Fry,I know but I forgive you.,44
467,Leela,"No, Fry, by ""close quarters"" I mean this office--",44
468,Fry,Uh-huh.,44
469,Leela,"And by ""people"" I mean you!",44
470,Fry,Right.,44
471,Leela,"And by ""inconsiderate"" I mean--",44
472,Fry,Leela! We're trying to watch TV.,44
473,Bender,Yeah. Would you kindly shut your noise hole?,44
474,Fry,"So, who's that weird-looking guy?",44
475,Bender,That's a human.,44
476,Fry,What's he do?,44
477,Bender,"Eh, the usual human stuff. He laughs, he learns, he loves.",44
478,Fry,Boring!,44
479,Human Friend,Calculon? I thought you were in a coma.,44
480,Calculon,"That's what I wanted you to think with your soft, human brain.",44
481,Fry,"Hey, uh, why is the TV getting smaller?",44
482,Hermes,We'll bill you for the couch.,44
483,Bender,"Cheer up, meatbag. You've barely touched your amoeba.",45
484,Fry,It looked good but I just don't feel like eating. You want it?,45
485,Bender,"Nah, I'm trying to watch my input. I need plenty of wholesome, nutritious alcohol.  The chemical energy keeps my fuel cells charged.",45
486,Fry,What are the cigars for?,45
487,Bender,They make me look cool.,45
488,Fry,I can't believe they threw me out like that. I must have been really acting like a jerk.,45
489,Bender,"Yeah, but everybody's a jerk. You, me, this jerk.  That's my philosophy. So, where you gonna stay?",45
490,Fry,I don't know. Do refrigerators still come in cardboard boxes?,45
491,Bender,"Yeah, but the rents are outrageous. Why don't you just come move in with me?",45
492,Fry,Really? That'd be great! You sure I won't be imposing?,45
493,Bender,"Nah, I've always wanted a pet.",45
494,Bender,Here we are. Your new home.,46
495,Fry,"Cool! Y'know, I've never even seen a robot's apartment before.",46
496,Bender,"Come on in, I'll give you the tour!",46
497,Bender,"Let's see, where to start. OK, this is the TV area, that over there's the breakfast nook, and over here is where you'll be living which is great because, until now, it's just been wasted space.",46
498,Fry,It's kinda cramped in here. I don't even have room to hang my clothes.,46
499,Bender,"Look, pal, you've only got one set of clothes and you're not taking them off while I'm here. Well, I'm bushed. G'night.",46
500,Fry,"Wait, Bender. Bender?",46
501,Bender,Kill all humans ... kill all humans ... must kill all the humans.,46
502,Fry,"Bender, wake up!",46
503,Bender,I was having the most wonderful dream. I think you were in it.,46
504,Fry,"Uh, listen, Bender. Uh, where's your bathroom?",46
505,Bender,Bath what?,46
506,Fry,Bathroom.,46
507,Bender,What room?,46
508,Fry,Bathroom!,46
509,Bender,What what?,46
510,Fry,"Ah, never mind!",46
511,Bender,"Hey, sexy mama, wanna kill all the humans?",46
512,Leela,We sure are cheerful this morning.,47
513,Bender,"Yeah, this past week with Fry's been a blast! Y'know, beneath this warm, sunny exterior beats the cold, mechanical heart of a robot.",47
514,Leela,What happened to you?,47
515,Fry,"Oh, it's Bender's apartment. He put in carpeting yesterday so now my head hits the ceiling. Hey, do you realise you're standing at a weird angle?  Now you're OK.",47
516,Leela,Look at yourself. You're a wreck! You've got to find a new place to live.,47
517,Fry,Is that an invitation?,47
518,Leela,"Love your optimism, Fry. But seriously, you've got to tell Bender you're moving out.",47
519,Fry,"Yeah, but he might get kind of upset. I don't think I can do that to him.",47
520,Bender,"Hey, there's my little space heater.",47
521,Fry,"Well, I'm moving out!",47
522,Bender,What?,47
523,Fry,"I'm sorry, Bender, but there's just not enough room.",47
524,Bender,Not enough room? My place is two cubic metres and we only take up 1.5 cubic metres. We've got room for a-whole-nother two-thirds of a person.,47
525,Leela,What if I just helped the two of you find a bigger apartment?,47
526,Bender,I don't know. I've got a lot of great memories in my old place.  And now they're gone.,47
527,Underwater house salesman,"Sure, it ain't one of them la-de-da above-ground places. But if you like dank, hey, forget about it!",48
528,Leela,At least it's got a great view.,48
529,Bender,What the--?,48
530,Underwater House Salesman,Excuse me. I gotta go change a lightbulb.,48
531,Leela,Wow! Now this is fantastic!,49
532,Fry,Hmm. I'm not sure we want to pay for a dimension we're not going to use.,49
533,Fry,"Well, I give up. What's the catch?",50
534,Suspiciously fantastic apartment salesman,"Oh, no catch. Although we 'are technically in New Jersey.",50
535,Fry,Not one place even remotely liveable.,51
536,Farnsworth,"Oh, how awful. Did he at least die painlessly? To shreds, you say. Well, how is his wife holding up? To shreds, you say. Very well then.  Sad, sad, terrible, gruesome news about my colleague, Dr. Mbutu.",51
537,Leela,Was his apartment rent-controlled?,51
538,Leela,Wow. This is beautiful.,52
539,Bender,What's with all the crap?,52
540,Leela,It's not crap.,52
541,Hattie,Dr. Mbutu collected this crap while he was exploring the watcha-call-it ... universe!,52
542,Fry,"Well, this place has everything except the only thing I care about",52
543,Hattie,"It's got a TV, you young watcha-call-it ... idiot!",52
544,Fry,Ooh!,52
545,Bender,"Whoa, slow down! This place just doesn't feel like home. It just isn't ... cosy.   It's perfect!",52
546,[Montage,Fry and Bender clear out the crap from the apartment to the theme of,52
547,Fry,"Man, it's a total sty! For the first time in a thousand years, I feel like I'm home.",52
548,Bender,"Yeah! It's gonna be fun on the bun! Y'know, Fry, of all the friends I've had, you're the first.",52
549,Hermes,"Hey, mon!",52
550,Leela,"Happy housewarming, Fry!  It's a miniature fruit salad tree.",52
551,Fry,"Ooh!  Hey, Amy!",52
552,Amy,Hey!,52
553,Farnsworth,"This is for you, Fry  Zevulon the Great. He's teriyaki style.",52
554,Bender,Wow! Heavy-drinking crowd!  I'd better go out for more beer.,52
555,Fry,"Hey, hang on, All My Circuits is about to start!",52
556,Bender,"I know, but I need alcohol to power up my batteries. If Calculon's wedding doesn't go just right I'll be emotionally and electrically drained.",52
557,Fry,Hey!,52
558,Hermes,These are mighty tasty!,52
559,Zoidberg,Thank you. I made them myself.,52
560,Fry,Sh! The wedding's about to start!,52
561,Preacherbot,"If anyone here objects to this union, let them speak now or forever hold their—",52
562,Fry,Is he objecting or backing up?,52
563,Amy,Looks like both.,52
564,Calculon,"I'm afraid my half-brother is correct. You see, I have a terrible secret and that secret is--",52
565,Amy,"Oh, this isn't right.",52
566,Hermes,"Oh, come on!",52
567,Farnsworth,Fix it!,52
568,Bender,"Hey, what happened to the TV?",52
569,Fry,It just went out.,52
570,Bender,This is an outrage! I'm gonna go yell at the manager!,52
571,Hermes,Alright!,52
572,Fry,"Come back, Bender! It's working!",52
573,Calculon,"To reiterate, my terrible secret is--",52
574,Fry,It's out again.,52
575,Bender,What? That's the last straw!,52
576,Fry,It's back on!,52
577,Hattie,Pardon me. I don't mean to pry into what you're doing in here with the crab and the one-eyed lady and the Chinese girl but everyone on this floor is having trouble with their TV reception.,52
578,Bender,Yeah! And you'd better get rid of whatever's causing it or we're outta this dump!,52
579,Hattie,"Relax, sonny. This kajigger'll find the source of the interference.",52
580,Tenant #1,What's going on?,52
581,Tenant #2,We want our TV back!,52
582,Hattie,There's your problem.,52
583,Amy,"Oh, my God! Bender, it's your thingy!",52
584,Randy,Then get rid of it!,52
585,Tenant #1,Get out!,52
586,Bender,You people are nuts. My antenna never interfered with my old TV.,52
587,Leela,You had cable. This is satellite.,52
588,Farnsworth,Obviously your thoughts are being transmitted on the same frequency.,52
589,Huge-assed woman,They're on my cell phone too.,52
590,Bender,"Madam, I believe you're mistaken!",52
591,Bender,"Wow, that lady's got a huge ass!",52
592,Bender,"Those could be anyone's thoughts, fat ass!",52
593,Randy,The robot has to go!,52
594,Tenant #1,Yeah.,52
595,Tenant #3,Get him out of here!,52
596,Hattie,"Well, you heard the mob!",52
597,Bender,"Fine! Come on, Fry, let's move to that apartment that smelled like a sewer. You liked that one, right?",52
598,Fry,"It's tempting, but, well, I am already kinda settled in here.",52
599,Bender,Or we could live underground with the mutants. A little fire'll show 'em who's boss!,52
600,Fry,"Uh, listen, is there maybe some way we could do this with you going and me not going?",52
601,Bender,I don't understand.,52
602,Fry,"Well, you were gonna live in the closet anyway. Won't you be just as happy back in your old place?",52
603,Bender,"But, then we wouldn't be roommates.",52
604,Fry,I'll come visit sometime. And you can visit me here.,52
605,Hattie,No he can't.,52
606,Fry,"Anyway, I'm sure it'll work out. This way we'll both be happy.",52
607,Bender,"Happy. Yeah, that's Bender. Always happy.",52
608,Randy,"Hey, the TV's back on!",52
609,Preacherbot,"We are gathered here to mourn the death of Calculon; industrialist, private eye, friend.",52
610,Calculon,Mind if I give the eulogy?,52
611,Monique,Calculon! You're alive!,52
612,Randy,Calculon's back!,52
613,Farnsworth,"Right, so long.",52
614,Zoidberg,Goodbye.,52
615,Amy,Do you think Calculon's evil twin will ever walk again?,52
616,Hermes,"I don't know, Amy. I just don't know.",52
617,Fry,"Hey, thanks for coming.",52
618,Leela,"Fry, you're Bender's best friend. How could you let that mob kick him out?",52
619,Fry,"Ah, come on. Bender loves mobs.",52
620,Leela,Only when he's in them and you know it. You really hurt his feelings.,52
621,Fry,Don't girl me with that girl stuff. Bender and me are guys. Guys don't have feelings.,52
622,Leela,"Bender's not a guy, he's a robot.",52
623,Fry,Same thing.,52
624,Bender,It's so big and empty.,53
625,Bender,"My roommate's gone. And all he left behind was an eyelash and three skin flakes.  Oh, what's the point?",53
626,Leela,"Bender?  My God, you're a mess!",54
627,Bender,Leave me alone!,54
628,Leela,"Look at that five o'clock rust. You've been up all night not drinking, haven't you?",54
629,Bender,Hey. What I don't do is none of your business.,54
630,Leela,"Please, Bender. Have some malt liquor. If not for yourself then for the people who love you.",54
631,Bender,I hate the people who love me and they hate me.,54
632,Leela,"Oh, now look. It's obvious you miss being Fry's roommate. But there's got to be a better way to deal with this.",54
633,Bender,Like how? Having my antenna removed?,54
634,Leela,"Well, if that would work.",54
635,Bender,Are you crazy? That's Little Bender you're talking about. I can't cut it off. You're not a robot or a man so you wouldn't understand. I gotta get out of here.,54
636,Leela,Wait! I want you to look me in the eye and promise you won't get behind the wheel without some kind of alcoholic beverage in your hand.,54
637,Bender,I promise nothing!,54
638,[Scene,Bender walks down a street à la,55
639,Fry,What up?,56
640,Leela,I can't just stand by and be silent about Bender anymore.,56
641,Fry,Silent? You've been meddling for two solid weeks.,56
642,Leela,Well I can't just do that anymore. Your best friend is out there somewhere destroying himself.,56
643,Fry,Really? I didn't think he'd miss this apartment that much.,56
644,Leela,"He doesn't care about the apartment, he cares about you. And you turned your back on him.",56
645,Fry,"Oh, man. I had no idea. If only I knew where he was I'd go talk to him.",56
646,Fry,"Oh, stupid TV!  Bender! You're blind-stinking sober!",56
647,Bender,That's right! I'm sober and crazy and I don't know what I might do!,56
648,Fry,Don't do it!,56
649,Bender,"I don't know what it is yet. Oh, yeah, now I remember. I thought I could live alone, but I can't. So, I'm gonna do what it takes to be your roommate again.",56
650,Leela,Bender! Stop!,56
651,Fry,Cutting Leela's head off won't solve anything!,56
652,Bender,"No, I'm going to chop off my antenna.",56
653,Fry,"Hey, yeah! That sounds good. Can I give you a hand?",56
654,Leela,Fry! Don't help him mutilate himself.,56
655,Fry,But it's a useless antenna. It's not like he's a ham radio or something.,56
656,Bender,I'm gonna do it! I'm really gonna do it! Don't try and stop me! Here goes.,56
657,Fry,"Hey, it works! The static's gone.",56
658,Human Friend,"I hate that this came between us, Calculon.",56
659,Calculon,Me too. I'm filled with a large number of powerful emotions.,56
660,Human Friend,You're my best friend. I'm sorry I treated you so badly.,56
661,Calculon,"Apology accepted. After all, you're only human.",56
662,Leela,You guys could learn a lesson from those two.,56
663,Fry,She's right.,56
664,Bender,"You're my best friend, Fry, I'm sorry I treated you so badly.",56
665,Fry,"Apology accepted. After all, you're only human.",56
666,Leela,"Wait a minute! You did it all backwards.  Oh, never mind!",56
667,Fry,What's wrong?,56
668,Bender,Nothing. I guess I'm just going to have to get used to being half a robot.,56
669,Fry,"Aw, this isn't right. Listen, Bender, if we found your antenna could they still reattach it?",56
670,Bender,Maybe. If we get it on ice right away.,56
671,Smitty,Bingo!,57
672,URL,You call that an antenna?,57
673,Bender,"This time, you'll have all the human comfort. We'll get a couple of toilets, some food cookers, maybe a puppy.",58
674,Fry,It's good to be home.,58
675,Bender,"It sure is. By the way, I saved your stuff.",58
676,Fry,"So that's where those skin flakes went. Hmm, do you think this fruit tree's going to get enough light?",58
677,Bender,There's a window in the closet.,58
678,Fry,"This is huge! Bender, why don't I just live in here?",58
679,Bender,"In a closet? Oh, humans!",58
680,Leela,This place was a great choice. The food is amazing. And such generous portions.,59
681,Doug,You like the meal just wait until you try these after-dinner mints.,59
682,Leela,"You know, Doug, most guys are put off by my eye. It's nice to finally meet someone who's open-minded.  Ew!",59
683,Fry,What was wrong with your date last night?,60
684,Leela,I don't know. Something I couldn't quite put my finger on. Possibly his vile lizard tongue.,60
685,Amy,You're too picky.,60
686,Fry,"Yeah. If you rule out every guy with a lizard tongue or a low I.Q. or an explosive violent temper, of course you're gonna be lonely.",60
687,Leela,There's nothing wrong with having high standards. Now can we please stop--,60
688,Zoidberg,The female Leela's problem is purely medical. Soon she will drop her eggs and they will hatch and all will be well.,60
689,Amy,"You just have to give guys a chance. Sometimes you meet a guy and think he's a pig, but then later you realise he actually has a really good body.",60
690,Leela,"Thank you all for the inspiring advice, but I'm perfectly happy with my life the way it is.",60
691,Bender,That sounds like a cry for help.,60
692,Amy,Let's all take her out tonight. There's lots of great places to meet people.,60
693,Hermes,The Federal Sex Bureau.,60
694,Bender,A saucy puppet show.,60
695,Zoidberg,The rotting carcass of a whale.,60
696,Amy,"Hmm, I'll pick!",60
697,[Scene,The Hip Joint. A nightclub on,61
698,Amy,"Oh, wow! It's totally retro!",61
699,Fry,Why's everyone wearing those rings?,61
700,Amy,Guh! Because nobody wears them anymore! Rings are stupid!,61
701,Fry,I think they look cool.,61
702,Amy,Sh! Don't let anyone hear you say that!,61
703,Man,"Hey, did that guy just say rings are cool?",61
704,Amy,"Nope, he said they're stupid.",61
705,Man,Cool!,61
706,Amy,So what do you think of that guy by the bar?,61
707,Leela,I don't know. Maybe?,61
708,Bender,"Forget it, he's gay.",61
709,Leela,What? How can you tell?,61
710,Bender,I just know these things. I've got what they call gaydar.,61
711,Leela,There's no such thing.,61
712,Bender,No?  Yep! He's gay!,61
713,Amy,Are you sure?,61
714,Bender,Definitely. Unless I'm getting interference from a gay weather balloon.,61
715,21st-century girl,You're from the 20th century? That's incredible! I'm from the 21st century.,61
716,Fry,No way! We've got so much in common.,61
717,21st-century girl,We sure do. Remember when those cyborgs enslaved humanity?,61
718,Fry,"Uh, yeah! That rings a bell.",61
719,Amy,This is Bolt Rolands. Bolt is a hyper-sled racer with 10 wins on the pro-circuit.,61
720,Bolt,"Hello, beautiful!",61
721,Bender,I think she means 10 wins on the gay circuit.,61
722,Bolt,I wish! Those cats can really fly.,61
723,Amy,"This is M5438, an entity of pure energy.",61
724,Leela,"That's great, really, but he's just not what I'm looking for.",61
725,M-5438,"I understand. One day you will evolve beyond your physical body, and on that day I hope you will pick up the phone.",61
726,Amy,You're impossible.,61
727,Bender,Just as well; I think he comes from a dimension that's big on musical theatre.,61
728,Fry,Pst. I need the apartment tonight. Go see a saucy puppet show.,62
729,Bender,Can do!,62
730,The Hip Joint janitor,"My, my, my! What's a beautiful lady like you—  Oh, my! Eurgh! I'm sorry, I thought you had two eyes.",63
731,Bender,"So, Leela, you must have had your pick of the litter last night at closing time.",64
732,Leela,Could you guys please stop talking about my personal life?,64
733,Farnsworth,"Yes, let's all talk about Leela's personal life later. But right now we have business to attend to.",64
734,Fry,A delivery?,64
735,Farnsworth,No. A tax-deductible mission of charity.,64
736,Computer Voice,This is Vergon 6.,64
737,Farnsworth,This is Vergon 6.,64
738,Amy,Buh!,64
739,Farnsworth,"It's a sunny little doomed planet, inhabited by a number of frisky little doomed animals.",64
740,Leela,Animals?,64
741,Farnsworth,"That's right. Animals in desperate need of rescue. You see, Vergon 6 was once filled with a super-dense substance known as dark matter, each pound of which weighs over ten thousand  pounds.",64
742,Leela,Wait! What about the animals?,64
743,Farnsworth,"Well, dark matter is extremely valuable as starship fuel. That's why it was all mined out, leaving the planet completely hollow.",64
744,Leela,"Yes, but what about the animals?",64
745,Farnsworth,The wha?,64
746,Leela,The animals.,64
747,Farnsworth,"I didn't say anything about animals. Now it seems that the planet will collapse within three days. Incidentally, this will kill all the animals.",64
748,Leela,So we have to bring back two of each kind. Just like Noah's Ark.,64
749,Bender,Why two?  Oh!,64
750,Fry,I bet you Leela's holding out for a nice guy with one eye.,65
751,Bender,"That'll take forever. What she oughta do is find a nice guy with two eyes, then poke one out.",65
752,Fry,"Yeah, that'd be a timesaver.",65
753,Leela,Do you mind?,65
754,Bender,Here you go.  You can use this as an eye-poker.,65
755,Leela,"Thank you. But I don't care how many eyes a man has ... as long as it's less than five. All I'm looking for is a guy who's adventurous, self-confident...",65
756,Leela,...maybe a snappy dresser.,65
757,Zapp,"These new uniforms are pretty snappy, eh, first officer?",65
758,Kif,"I suppose, Captain. I'm not as big a fan of velour as you are. Now what do you want to do about that unidentified ship?",65
759,Zapp,Destroy them!  Mmm! That's got a nice feel to it.,65
760,Zapp,Captain's journal,65
761,Kif,"Who are you talking to, sir?",65
762,Zapp,"You! Aren't you getting this?  We have detected a vessel attempting to break the security cordon around Vergon 6. I'm anticipating an all-out tactical dogfight, followed by a light dinner ... ravioli, ham, sundae bar.",65
763,Leela,"Hey, look! That's Zapp Brannigan's ship.",65
764,Fry,Wow! The Zapp Brannigan?,65
765,Leela,Uh-huh!,65
766,Fry,Who's the Zapp Brannigan?,65
767,Kif,"Shall I fire on them now, sir?",65
768,Zapp,"Not yet, Kif. In the game of chess, you can never let your adversary see your pieces.  What?",65
769,Leela,They say Zapp Brannigan single-handedly saved the Octillian System from a horde of rampaging Killbots.,65
770,Fry,Wow!,65
771,Bender,"A grim day for robot-kind. Ah, but we can always build more Killbots!",65
772,Leela,He's the most decorated captain in the whole Democratic Order of Planets.,65
773,Fry,Leela's got a boyfriend!,65
774,Leela,No I don't. But I think we ought to meet with him and see if he'll help us rescue those animals.,65
775,Bender,"Well, just in case you guys hit it off, you'll wanna take this with you.",65
776,Kif,"Sir, they're headed straight for us.",65
777,Zapp,"A well-calculated move straight out of Sun Tzu's classic text The Art Of War, or my own masterwork",65
778,Kif,"Sir, they've docked with us and have come aboard.",65
779,Zapp,"Then I have risked all and lost. Kif, old man, I'll be in the escape pod.  If that wicker chair I like survives the slaughter, have it sent to my P.O. box.",65
780,Leela,"Hello, I'm Leela, captain of the Planet Express delivery ship. We've come aboard to plead for your assistance.",65
781,Kif,"Well, if there's anything--",65
782,Zapp,I'm in command here. Zapp Brannigan. Has my fame preceded me or was I too quick for you?,65
783,Leela,"Oh, not at all. I'm just so, uh, really thrilled to meet you!",65
784,Zapp,You're an impressive piece of captain. Beautiful and deadly -- a potent combination.,65
785,Leela,You don't mean that!,65
786,Zapp,"But I do. I doubt I've seen more than three or four captains sexier than you, and only one who was deadlier.",65
787,Fry,I heard that one time you single-handedly defeated a horde of rampaging somethings in the something-something-system.,65
788,Zapp,The Killbots? A trifle! It was simply a matter of outsmarting them.,65
789,Fry,Wow! I never would have thought of that!,65
790,Zapp,"You see, Killbots have a preset kill limit. Knowing their weakness, I sent wave after wave of my own men at them, until they reached their limit and shutdown. Kif, show them the medal I won.",65
791,Zapp,"More, please.  A little more ... more ... keep going.",66
792,Leela,"Captain Brannigan, we really need to talk to you about our mission.",66
793,Zapp,"Whatever it is, I'm willing to put wave after wave of men at your disposal. Right, men?",66
794,Crewman,You suck!,66
795,Leela,We're hoping to save the animals of Vergon 6 from extinction. And if you could just--,66
796,Zapp,Vergon 6? This light dinner is over.,66
797,Leela,Wait! What's wrong?,66
798,Zapp,"The Democratic Order of Planets prohibits interfering with undeveloped worlds. It's a little rule known as ""Brannigan's Law"".",66
799,Leela,But people already interfered. That planet was mined completely hollow.,66
800,Zapp,"Yes, by a Democratic Order of Planets mining crew.",66
801,Leela,This doesn't make any sense.,66
802,Zapp,I don't pretend to understand Brannigan's Law. I merely enforce it.,66
803,Leela,Fine! We'll save the animals without your help.,66
804,Zapp,I'm afraid I can't allow that. Guards!,66
805,Fry,What just happened?,66
806,Bender,He's throwing us in prison.,66
807,Fry,Dang! Can I get this wrapped up?,66
808,Leela,Ow! I might've liked Zapp Brannigan if he weren't a pompous dimwit who threw me in prison.,67
809,Bender,You really are too picky.,67
810,Zapp,"Kif, follow me up to the observation deck. I've got some musing to do.",68
811,Kif,"Oh, jeez!",68
812,Zapp,"I'm facing a formidable female adversary, Kif. Suggestions?",69
813,Kif,"I fail to see any problem, sir. You already imprisoned her under directive B-10.8-1.",69
814,Zapp,You mean Brannigan's Law?,69
815,Kif,"Right, that law.",69
816,Zapp,Which one?,69
817,Kif,Brannigan's Law.,69
818,Zapp,"Kif, you're my best and most loyal friend but you've earned my contempt once again. As my protégé you should know that the only way to deal with a female adversary is to seduce her.  This time we are sure she's a woman, right?",69
819,Kif,Yes.,69
820,Zapp,"Good! Invite her to my quarters. Oh, and have the boy lay out my formal shorts.",69
821,Kif,"""The boy"", sir?",69
822,Zapp,You. You lay out my formal shorts.,69
823,Kif,The jackass wants to see you in his quarters.,70
824,Leela,"Good. This will be my chance to reason with him, captain to captain.",70
825,Kif,And he wants you to wear this.,70
826,Zapp,Come and get it!,70
827,Zapp,"Welcome to my humble chamber, or as I call it, ""the Lovenasium"". Sham-pag-in?",70
828,Leela,I didn't realise you were such a coin-a-sewer.,70
829,Zapp,Well I have studied abroad. Or two!,70
830,Leela,Captain--,70
831,Zapp,Uh-huh?,70
832,Leela,If we could speak seriously for a moment--,70
833,Zapp,Uh-huh?,70
834,Leela,I'd like you to reconsider letting us rescue those animals.,70
835,Zapp,Mm-hm.  I like your style. I find it very...  erotic.,70
836,Leela,What?,70
837,Zapp,Erotic!,70
838,Fry,"We can definitely escape, Bender. All you have to do is bend the hatch off this steam pipe.",71
839,Bender,"Hey, yeah!",71
840,Fry,No good! It's full of steam!,71
841,Zapp,You look like a woman who enjoys the finer things. Come over here and feel my velour bedspread.,72
842,Leela,I'm not really in the mood.,72
843,Zapp,"Leela, it's real velour. Just let yourself go.",72
844,Leela,Can I please just go back to prison?,72
845,Zapp,You'd rather sit in prison than spend one evening with the Zapper?,72
846,Leela,Much rather!  What are you doing?,72
847,Zapp,"Oh, God, I'm pathetic. Sorry. Just go. You want the rest of the sham-pag-in?",72
848,Leela,"No. And it's pronounced ""sham-pane"".",72
849,Zapp,"Oh, God, no!",72
850,Leela,It's not a big deal.,72
851,Zapp,"I get so lonely. I just thought you, a fellow captain, would understand.",72
852,Leela,"Oh, forget it.",72
853,Zapp,"Yeah, it's great ordering people around and stuff but through it all you're completely alone.",72
854,Leela,It comes with the job.,72
855,Zapp,I'm just so lonely!,72
856,Leela,"Oh, come on. Cheer up. It's not that bad.",72
857,Fry,You wanna try escaping again?,73
858,Bender,"Nah, I'm comfy.",73
859,Fry,"Man, Leela's been gone a long time. I hope she's at least making progress with Zapp Brannigan.",73
860,Zapp,"Good morning, lover.",73
861,Leela,"Uh, listen, Zapp.",73
862,Zapp,Now you're officially my woman. Kudos! I can't say I don't envy you.,73
863,Leela,"Zapp, last night was a mistake.",73
864,Zapp,A sexy mistake.,73
865,Leela,"No, just a regular mistake. For a split second my common sense was overwhelmed by pity.",73
866,Zapp,A split second is all it takes. That's why sooner or later you'll come crawling back to the Zapper.,73
867,Leela,The only kind of crawling I'm doing to you is away ... from!,73
868,Zapp,"Leela, you're obviously confused and aroused.",73
869,Leela,"Look, I'm going down to Vergon 6 to save those animals whether you like it or not.",73
870,Zapp,Go ahead. I won't stop you.,73
871,Leela,Threaten all you-- Wait. What?,73
872,Zapp,"We both know you won't make it halfway to Vergon 6 before the craving sets in. Then you'll come crawling back for another taste of sweet, sweet candy ... bam!",73
873,Leela,Eurgh!,73
874,Zapp,Kif!,73
875,Kif,"Yes--  Yes, Captain?",73
876,Zapp,I have made it with a woman. Inform the men.,73
877,Kif,The fatso says you're free to go.,74
878,Fry,Really? Why?,74
879,Kif,"""Why"" indeed.",74
880,Fry,What does that mean?,74
881,Leela,Nothing.,74
882,Bender,So should we get our stuff and head down to the planet?,74
883,Leela,"We just talked, OK?!",74
884,Leela,"Alright, we don't have much time to collect these animals. The planet is supposed to collapse in approximately two hours ago.",76
885,Leela,"Hello, there.  Hmm. He doesn't seem to be on the checklist.",76
886,Bender,"So, you're saying we can cook him?",76
887,Fry,"Yeah, a barbecue! I'll wear my hilarious apron.",76
888,Leela,"No! I don't care how hilarious your apron is, we're not cooking him.  Aww! I'll call him Nibbler.",76
889,Bender,Aww!  I'll fire up the grill!,76
890,Leela,I hope he'll be OK in there with all those big animals.,76
891,Zapp,"Y'know, Kif, once my woman returns I won't have much time to hang out with the boys anymore.",78
892,Kif,"That's a shame, sir.",78
893,Zapp,"So let's make the most of our time together, shall we?  Never mind. Just give me a back rub.",78
894,Bender,I found a pair of hermaphlamingos.,79
895,Leela,Good. That's the last species.,79
896,Bender,Hey. What the--?,80
897,Fry,Where'd they all go?,80
898,Leela,Nibbler!,80
899,Fry,I can't believe we flew halfway across the galaxy and enjoyed a steam just to get lunch for that stupid animal!,80
900,Bender,He's pending for a bending.,80
901,Leela,"Leave him alone. It's not his fault that he's an unstoppable killing machine. Is it, snoogums?",80
902,Fry,The planet's kerploding!,80
903,Leela,"Prepare for lift-off.  We're out of fuel. Bender, I told you to fill the tank before we left.",80
904,Bender,"Yeah, I'll do it when we get back.",80
905,Fry,"Man, lucky for us Zapp Brannigan's nearby.",80
906,Leela,No way! Forget it! I refuse to go crawling back to him!,80
907,Fry,What? What are you talking about?,80
908,Leela,Nothing. We just talked.,80
909,Bender,"So what's your problem? It's not like you slept with him.  Oh, my God!",80
910,Fry,"How could you, Leela? I thought you had some standards. I mean, jeez, he's a dumb, gross gorilla!",80
911,Leela,That's enough! Don't you think I feel bad enough already?,80
912,Fry,No!,80
913,Leela,"Alright, alright. I'll call him.  I mean, if living is that important to you.",80
914,Zapp,"And that's why you'll never make captain, Kif.  Hmm.",81
915,Leela,"Hello, Zapp?",81
916,Zapp,"Well, well, well!",81
917,Leela,"Zapp, we're out of fuel...",81
918,Leela,...and Vergon 6 is about to implode. We need your help.,81
919,Zapp,"So, crawling back to the Big Z like a bird on its belly. Delicious.",81
920,Leela,Bird's don't crawl.,81
921,Zapp,They've been known to.,81
922,Leela,"Look, are you going to rescue us or not?",81
923,Zapp,Can't you ask a little more ... sexfully?,81
924,Leela,Please?,81
925,Leela,Big Z?,81
926,Zapp,"Certainly. But first you'll have to get rid of that thing.  That's the law, Leela. And Brannigan's Law is like Brannigan's love",81
927,Zapp,Now put that greasy rat outside and we'll tow you to safety.,81
928,Leela,"I would never abandon a helpless animal. Y'know, Zapp, once I thought you were a big, pompous buffoon. Then I realised that inside you were just a pitiful child. But now I realise that outside that child is a big, pompous buffoon!",81
929,Zapp,And which one rocked your world?,81
930,Fry,Wow! Way to tell that guy off. Now what's your secret escape plan?,81
931,Leela,"Uh, I guess to sit here and wait for death.",81
932,Bender,Can do!,81
933,Bender,What the hell was that?,81
934,Fry,Pew!,82
935,Leela,I don't believe it! It's dark matter.,82
936,Bender,So this guy just unloaded a steaming pile of starship fuel?,82
937,Leela,"His species must've filled the entire planet with it. Did you do that, you cute little--  Come on. That should be more than enough fuel to get us outta here. Bender, pick it up and put it in the engine.",82
938,Leela,We made it!  And some of the animals survived.,82
939,Bender,So a couple of animals didn't die and Leela got lucky. That's what I call a successful mission!,82
940,Fry,We're heroes!,82
941,Leela,Dear Captain's Diary,83
942,Zapp,Captain's journal,84
943,Kif,April 13th.,84
944,Zapp,April 13th ... point two.,84
945,Zapp,"We have failed to uphold Brannigan's Law. However, I did make it with a hot alien babe. And in the end is that not what man has dreamt of since first he looked up at the stars? Kif, I'm asking you a question!",84
946,Leela,What do you think of the view Fry?,85
947,Fry,"It really puts things in perspective. I mean, from up here an entire world can seem utterly insignificant.",85
948,Bender,"Hey nice seats! We're close enough so when you knock a player down with a beer bottle, he stays down!",86
949,Fry,I don't get it. Is blernsball exactly the same as baseball?,86
950,Farnsworth,Baseball?? God forbid!,86
951,Leela,Face it Fry. Baseball was as boring as mum and apple pie. That's why they jazzed it up.,86
952,Fry,"Boring? Baseball wasn't - hmm, so they finally jazzed it up?",86
953,Fry,Home run!! Woooo! Right?,86
954,Umpire,Out!,86
955,Fry,What just happened? Why is the ball on that springy thing?,86
956,Leela,It's traditional. Just like aluminium bats and the seventh inning grope.,86
957,Bender,I got me a souvenir!  Aww here you go kid!,86
958,Zoidberg,I'd like a jumbo squidlog please.,87
959,Man,We don't sell those.,87
960,Zoidberg,"Alright, alright. Let me have one of your young on a roll.",87
961,Man,We're out of rolls.,87
962,Zoidberg,Fine! Just give me something crawling with parasites.,87
963,Fry,"Mmmm, at least hot dogs haven't changed.",87
964,Bender,Hey buddies who wants popcorn?,87
965,All,"I'll have some, me, yeah!",87
966,Bender,Anyone want butter on that?,87
967,Fry,"Hey I'm starting to get the hang of this game! The blerns are loaded, the count's three blerns and two anti-blerns and the infield blern rule is in effect, right?",87
968,Leela,"Except for the word ""blern"" that was complete gibberish. [The blernsball falls into a hole and indescribable mayhem ensues! Fry scratches his head in confusion. Leela writes on her score card. All right! Yes!!",87
969,Fry,What just happened?,87
970,Leela,Miller's on a pace to hit 70 blerns!,87
971,Farnsworth,He's good all right. But he's no Clem Johnson. And Johnson played back in the days when steroid injections were mandatory.,87
972,Bender,"Clem Johnson? That skin bag wouldn't have lasted one pitch in the old Robot Leagues! Now Wireless Joe Jackson, there was a blern hitting machine!",87
973,Leela,Exactly! He was a machine designed to hit blerns! I mean come on! Wireless Joe was nothing but a programmable bat on wheels.,87
974,Bender,Oh and I suppose pitching at 5000 was just a modified howitzer.,87
975,Leela,Yep.,87
976,Bender,You humans are so scared of a little robot competition you won't even let us on the field.,87
977,Fry,What are you talking about? There's all kinds of robots down there.,87
978,Bender,"Yeah doing crap work! They're bat boys, ball polishers, sprinkler systems. But how many robot managers are there?",87
979,Fry,Eleven?,87
980,Bender,Zero!  And what a surprise! Look who's scraping up the filth! Is it a human child? I wish!,87
981,Farnsworth,Oh dear Lord!,87
982,Fry,What's wrong?,87
983,Farnsworth,It's...my...new...pager.,87
984,Hermes,Get away you filthy bird! Shoo! Professor turn me off quick!,87
985,Farnsworth,I'm sorry what?,87
986,Hermes,See you at the office!,87
987,Bender,Admit it. You all think robots are machines built by humans to make their lives easier.,88
988,Fry,"Well, aren't they?",88
989,Bender,I've never made anyone's life easier and you know it!,88
990,Farnsworth,Great news everyone. You'll be delivering a package to Chapek 9. A world where humans are killed on sight!,88
991,Fry,Why is that great news?,88
992,Farnsworth,I'm glad you asked that question Fry. You see Chapek 9 was colonised centuries ago by a murderous crew of radical robot separatists.,88
993,Bender,Oh so just 'cause a robot wants to kill humans that makes him a radical?,88
994,Leela,Hey hold on. I understand these robots hate humans but how do they feel about humanoid aliens?,88
995,Farnsworth,They're not fans.,88
996,Hermes,That's why Bender will have to make the actual delivery.,88
997,Bender,"Oh I get it, make the robot do all the work!",88
998,Leela,This is the first actual work you've ever had to do around here.,88
999,Bender,Well I'm not doing it! It's a robot holiday.,88
1000,Fry,Really? Which one?,88
1001,Bender,Only Robanukah. The holiest two weeks on the robot calendar.,88
1002,Leela,Oh come on Bender. Last month it was Robomadan and before that Robonzaa.,88
1003,Fry,Man that one was a blast!,88
1004,Bender,It wasn't just a blast it was a sacred tribute to my ancestral prototypes which happened to take the form of a drinking contest.,88
1005,Hermes,Now look here Bender. I respect your diversity to the extent the law requires but you used up all your days off when you had that bout of Roberculosis.,88
1006,Bender,"All right, I'll go. But so help me, I'll hold a grudge against every last one of you for the rest of your lives.",88
1007,Farnsworth,Well then it's settled. So long everyone!,88
1008,Fry,So let me get this straight,89
1009,Bender,No. It's inhabited by robots!,89
1010,Fry,Oh. Kinda like how a warehouse is inhabited by boxes.,89
1011,Leela,"OK Bender, we're here. It's time to get to work.",90
1012,Bender,"Yes Miss Leela, tote that space barge, lift that space bale.",90
1013,Leela,"Now we can't land on the surface because those robots will kill Fry and me, so we'll have to stay up here and lower you with the winch. And remember",90
1014,Bender,I'll try to keep that in mind!,90
1015,Leela,"Hmm, he seems pretty angry.",90
1016,Fry,Yeah but I guess I'd be angry too if I had to go to some uninhabited planet.,90
1017,Leela,Maybe we ought to do something nice for him.,90
1018,Leela,There. That ought to show that stupid robot we care about him.,91
1019,Fry,"Ah, Bender must be done with the delivery.",91
1020,Bender,,91
1021,Fry,Oh my God! We have to go down and rescue him.,91
1022,Leela,No we can't! They'll kill us on sight.,91
1023,Fry,Well what are we going to do?,91
1024,Leela,"I don't know, I don't know. It's not an easy decision. If only I had two or three minutes to think about it.",91
1025,Leela,"OK. If we're going to save Bender, we've got to look and act exactly like robots.",92
1026,Fry,,92
1027,Leela,"We have to walk like robots, talk like robots and if necessary solve complex differential equations like robots.",92
1028,Fry,I can sort of dance like a robot. Will that help?,92
1029,Leela,Fry first of all this is serious. And second of all...,92
1030,Fry,"Man, we look stupid. We should've gotten store bought costumes.",92
1031,Leela,"Yeah, but there wasn't a Woolworth's in this quadrant.",92
1032,Robot guard #1,Halt!,92
1033,Robot guard #2,Be you robot or human?,92
1034,Leela,Robot...we be.,92
1035,Fry,Uh yup! Just two robots out roboting it up!  Eh?,92
1036,Robot guard #1,Administer the test.,92
1037,Robot guard #2,Which of the following would you most prefer? A,92
1038,Robot guard #1,Choose!,92
1039,Fry,Is the puppy mechanical in any way?,92
1040,Robot guard #2,No. It is the bad kind of puppy.,92
1041,Leela,Then we'll go with that data file.,92
1042,Robot guard #2,Correct.,92
1043,Robot guard #1,The flower would also have been acceptable.,92
1044,Robot guard #2,You may pass.,92
1045,Leela,"Now if you see any robots, just stay out of their way.  So far, so good.",92
1046,Robot builder,"Little to the right, there you go.",92
1047,Leela,Have you seen this robot?,92
1048,Robot builder,"Sorry, can't help you.  Aw!",92
1049,Leela,"Come on Fry, walk like a robot.",92
1050,Fry,I can't. I have to go to the bathroom.,92
1051,Leela,Robot's don't have bathrooms.,92
1052,Fry,Oh right. I wonder where they all smoke in high school.,92
1053,Leela,Listen. Just go behind those garbage cans. I'll stand guard.,92
1054,Leela,Hurry up Fry.,92
1055,Resin-offering robot,Sir? Are you aware that you're leaking coolant at an alarming rate?,92
1056,Fry,Uh...,92
1057,Resin-offering robot,Well let me just patch you up with some hot resin.,92
1058,Fry,I think the leak's stopping itself.  Wait. Yeah!,92
1059,Resin-offering robot,What sort of robot turns down a free blast of searing hot resin?,92
1060,Leela,I'm sorry. My friend and I have to go and perform some mindless repetitive tasks.,92
1061,Resin-offering robot,Sounds like a romantic evening. I won't keep you.,92
1062,Patrol Officer #1,Get the humanoids.,92
1063,Patrol Officer #2,Get the intruder.,92
1064,Announcer,,92
1065,Leela,Quick! Let's duck in here!,92
1066,Announcer,,93
1067,Rusty,,93
1068,Wendy,,93
1069,Rusty,,93
1070,Robot Human,I will eat and digest you all with my system of mighty organs! Behold!,93
1071,Audience,Ooooo!,93
1072,Fry,Wow the 3-D's great!,93
1073,Leela,Mine's not working!,93
1074,Robot General,,93
1075,Wendy,,93
1076,Robot General,,93
1077,Fry,God help us!,93
1078,Leela,OK. Keep an eyeout for Bender.,94
1079,Robot #1,So what did you think of the movie?,94
1080,Fry,"Umm, too much romance, not enough human killing.",94
1081,Robot #2,"Yeah, it was a real chick flick.",94
1082,Leela,What's that?,94
1083,Robot #1,"What do you mean ""What's that?""? Its 5 o'clock",94
1084,Leela,Try to stay with the crowd so no one notices how crummy you look.,94
1085,Crummy Robot,Awww that was uncalled for!,94
1086,Fry,I'm over here!,94
1087,Robot #4,I heard a human was draining coolant behind garbage can 738.,94
1088,Robot #5,I heard they unscrew our lugnuts at night and eat them at their human brunches.,94
1089,Robot Mayor,"Welcome to a very special human hunt. We have with us today a guest who's irrational hatred of humans makes me look like a human sympathiser!  A newly arrived refugee from Earth, lets hear it for - Bender!",94
1090,Fry,It's him. He's OK!,94
1091,Bender,Death to humans!,94
1092,Fry,Ahh! It's good to hear his voice!,94
1093,Bender,"Many said I was too extreme when I first called for the annihalation of the human species, as well as some of the more cunning monkeys. But after living on Earth I can tell you that I am, if anything, too merciful!",94
1094,Fry,My God! He's become evil.  I mean eviler!,94
1095,Bender,"Thank you, thank you. And if you enjoyed that diatribe then you'll want to purchase my spoken word album, just 18.95! Act now and you'll get this Bender action figurine.",94
1096,Bender Figurine,Bite my shiny metal ass!,94
1097,Robot Mayor,Let the hunt begin!,94
1098,Bender,"Now. Your basic human is between three and twenty five feet tall and is made of a hairy, oily goo wrapped in a t-shirt.",94
1099,Robot #1,"Is it true they bite your neck, suck your transmission fluid and then you become a human?",94
1100,Bender,"Sure, why not?",94
1101,Robot #1,Anything in the trap?,94
1102,Bender,Nothing. Today's active humans prefer a low calorie bait.,94
1103,Robot Mayor,"Well that makes 146,000 unsuccessful hunts in a row. But I've got a good feeling about tomorrow.",94
1104,Bender,"Wait, what's that?",94
1105,Robot Mayor,Oh thats the old abandoned adult book store. Nothing in there except a few mouldy old shreads of robot pornography.,94
1106,Bender,"Hmmm, sounds like a breeding ground for humans. I'd better check it out.",94
1107,Bender,Oh yeah! You're a bad girl aren't you?,95
1108,Fry,Psst! Bender!,95
1109,Bender,Huh? Wha? You! What the hell are you doing here?,95
1110,Fry,We've been looking for you. Last we heard you were under arrest as a human sympathiser.,95
1111,Bender,I was. But they let me go when I told them that I'd killed a million billion humans.,95
1112,Leela,Good for you. Now lets all get back to the ship.,95
1113,Bender,What for?,95
1114,Fry,We're rescuing you.,95
1115,Bender,I don't wanna be rescued.,95
1116,Fry,Say what?,95
1117,Bender,"I love this planet. I've got wealth, fame and access to sleaze that those things bring.",95
1118,Fry,"But Bender, we're your friends.",95
1119,Bender,"Friends? That activates my hilairity unit! I'm just a machine to you. You're no more friends with me than you are with the toaster, the phonograph or the electric chair.",95
1120,Fry,That's not true.,95
1121,Bender,Well that's how it feels to me.,95
1122,Fry,Bye Bender. I'll miss you.,95
1123,Bender,"Go on, get out of here before you get caught.",95
1124,Robot Mayor,"Bender, good news. Your album just went gold! What the?",95
1125,Robot #1,Its the humans!,95
1126,Robot Mayor,Bender! Do something!,95
1127,Bender,Uh...got you...you muderous...flesh piles!,95
1128,Robot Mayor,"Your Honour, I intend to demonstrate beyond 0.5% of a doubt that these humans before us are guilty of the crime of being humans. Come to think of it, I rest my case!",96
1129,Judge,"Thank you, Prosecutor. I will now consider the evidence.",96
1130,Fry,"Hey, wait a minute! Isn't anyone gonna defend us?",96
1131,Leela,"Yeah! I mean, he might not have a case, but I'm genuinely not human.",96
1132,Robot Mayor,"Quiet, human!",96
1133,Robot clerk,Uh oh! He froze up again!,96
1134,Robot Mayor,Try control alt delete.,96
1135,Robot #1,Jiggle the cord.,96
1136,Robot #2,Turn him off and on.,96
1137,Robot #3,Clean the gunk out of the mouse.,96
1138,Fry,Call technical support.,96
1139,Robot clerk,"OK, OK. He's back online.",96
1140,Judge,I find the defendants - guilty!,96
1141,Fry,No!,96
1142,Leela,Look! One eye! Count them,96
1143,Judge,"The humans are hereby sentenced to live as robots live on Earth. They will perform tedious calculations and spot-weld automobiles, until they become obsolete and are given away to an inner-city middle school.",96
1144,Robot Mayor,Great work Bender! You've taught us to hate humans all over again!,96
1145,Bender,,96
1146,Leela,Are you alright?,96
1147,Fry,Oh yeah.,96
1148,Leela,Who are you?,96
1149,Blue Elder,We are the robot elders.,96
1150,Fry,You don't look very old.,96
1151,Blue Elder,Thanks. We try to take care of ourselves.,96
1152,Leela,What's going on here?,96
1153,Orange Elder,Silence! Bring in Bender.,96
1154,Bender,"Alright lets make this quick, I'm due at the opening of a mini-mall. Hey what is this?",96
1155,Blue Elder,Silence! It is time to put the humans to death!,96
1156,Fry,But the judge already sentenced us at the trial!,96
1157,Orange Elder,"Silence! That was just a show for the public. We are the true rulers of this planet, hand carved from meteorites by the Robot Founders, over four centuries ago.",96
1158,Blue Elder,Silence! Come forward Bender. You will have the honour of executing the prisoners.,96
1159,Green Elder,Silence! I concur!,96
1160,Orange Elder,Here. Use the ceremonial killamajig.,96
1161,Bender,"Uh, I'm a little tired right now. Would it be alright if I just gave them a savage beating?",96
1162,Blue Elder,No! The Elders have spoken. Show us the killing skills than have made you a media darling.,96
1163,Green Elder,Do it now! Kill them before they bring down our whole society!,96
1164,Elders,Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it!,96
1165,Bender,"Aww!  I can't kill them. Plenty of humans have mistreated robots but not these two. they're my friends. Humans are no threat to us. They're stupid, putrid cowards.",96
1166,Fry,Damn right!,96
1167,Bender,"The fact is, humans are completely harmless.",96
1168,Blue Elder,We're well aware of that.,96
1169,Bender,You are?,96
1170,Blue Elder,Of course. But they're useful to us as a scapegoat to distract the public from their real problem.,96
1171,Green Elder,Like our crippling lugnut shortage.,96
1172,Orange Elder,And a corrupt government of incompetent Robot Elders.,96
1173,Lime Elder,"Duh, that's for sure.",96
1174,Blue Elder,Quiet Jimmy.,96
1175,Bender,Well I'm glad we got all that out in the open. We'll just let ourselves out.,96
1176,Green Elder,Silence! You all know too much.,96
1177,Blue Elder,Elders,96
1178,Fry,Stop! Take one more step and I'll breathe fire on you!,96
1179,Leela,He'll do it. He's crazy!,96
1180,Orange Elder,Can they really breathe fire or did we make that up?,96
1181,Blue Elder,"Gee, I can't remember anymore! It might just be from that stupid movie.",96
1182,Green Elder,Was that the original or the re-make?,96
1183,Blue Elder,I don't - hey! They're getting away.,96
1184,Fry,"So long suckers!  Uh, hello suckers!",97
1185,Bender,Hey hold on a second I forgot to deliver the package.,97
1186,Robot #1,Lugnuts! Precious lugnuts!,97
1187,Robot #2,Hooray for the humans!,97
1188,Bender,"Wow, I can't believe you guys did all this for me! This is the best Robanukah ever!",97
1189,Fry,We wanted to show you that we really do respect your robot heritage.,97
1190,Bender,"Aww, thanks! You do know I made Robanukah up to get out of work right?",97
1191,Leela,Of course.,97
1192,Fry,But that doesn't make it any less meaningful!,97
1193,Bender,In that case - let the dancing begin!  Hey you guys are good. How the hell do you do that??,97
1194,Fry,"I can't take it anymore! They've been at it for hours!   Give it a rest, you two!",98
1195,Robot,Sorry!,98
1196,Teacher,"Good morning, class. I trust you've all prepared for today's final exam.",99
1197,Fry,"Uh, excuse me? I missed a few lectures. Uh, what subject is this?",99
1198,Teacher,Ancient Egyptian algebra.,99
1199,Fry,What a nightmare!,99
1200,Teacher,"Mister Fry, are those your underpants?  Young man, I think it's time you learned a lesson about Lightspeed brand briefs.",99
1201,Announcer,"Lightspeed briefs, style and comfort for the discriminating crotch.",99
1202,Fry,What a weird dream! I'll never get back to sleep.,99
1203,Fry,So you're telling me they broadcast commercials into people's dreams?,100
1204,Leela,Of course.,100
1205,Fry,"But, how is that possible?",100
1206,Farnsworth,"It's very simple. The ad gets into your brain just like this liquid gets into this egg.  Although, in reality, it's not liquid, but gamma radiation.",100
1207,Fry,That's awful. It's like brainwashing.,100
1208,Leela,Didn't you have ads in the 20th century?,100
1209,Fry,"Well, sure, but not in our dreams. Only on TV and radio. And in magazines and movies and at ball games, on buses and milk cartons and T-shirts and bananas and written on the sky. But not in dreams. No, sir-ee!",100
1210,Bender,"Quit squawking, flesh wad. Nobody's forcing you to buy anything.",100
1211,Amy,"Yeah. I mean we all have commercials in our dreams but you don't see us running off to buy brand-name merchandise at low, low prices.",100
1212,Perfume saleswoman,Hi! Care to sample the latest fragrance from Calvin Clone?,101
1213,Amy,No thanks.,101
1214,Perfume saleswoman,"And you, sir?",101
1215,Bender,No thanks. I--,101
1216,Cosmetologist,What a lovely face. We just need to draw attention away from the eye area.,101
1217,Fry,Cool.  Can I try these on before I buy them?,101
1218,Salesman,I'm afraid I can't let you open the package. But you can try on the demo pair.,101
1219,Fry,"Ooh! Ho, ho, ho!",102
1220,Amy,"Hey, Bender! Great new sweater.",103
1221,Bender,New? What sweater? I came in with it. I don't know you people!,103
1222,Salesman,"$30, please.",103
1223,Fry,$30? I can't afford that. Unless...  Do you take Visa?,103
1224,Salesman,Visa hasn't existed for 500 years.,103
1225,Fry,American Express?,103
1226,Salesman,600 years.,103
1227,Fry,Discover card?,103
1228,Salesman,Sorry we don't take Discover.,103
1229,Amy,Hey! You're springing for Lightspeed? Pretty ritzy!,103
1230,Fry,"No, I can't afford them. Being poor sucks. What kind of world is this where they advertise things not everybody can afford?",103
1231,Amy,Quiet. There's an ad coming on.,103
1232,Mom,"Hello, shoppers. It's me, Mom!",103
1233,Fry,Hey who's the rocker jockey?,103
1234,Amy,Guh! It's Mom. The world's most huggable industrialist.,103
1235,Mom,"Call me old-fashioned, but when my robot starts to squeak like an old screen door, well, that's when I reach for a can of Mom's Old Fashioned Robot Oil.",103
1236,Bender,"Mmm, tasty!",103
1237,Mom,And remember,103
1238,Announcer,"""Mom"", ""love"" and ""screen door"" are registered trademarks of Momcorp.",103
1239,Fry,"Hey, Bender. Sounds like you could use a little of that oil.",103
1240,Bender,I'm boned.,103
1241,Smitty,"Freeze, scuzzbot!",103
1242,Bender,"Uh, there's obviously been some sort of a mistake here.  That is, I'm sure there's ... a very ... reasonable--",103
1243,Amy,Do we have enough money to pay Bender's fine?,104
1244,Fry,"78, 79, 79.50. Crud! We're 50 cents short.",104
1245,Leela,I'd love to chip in but Bender stole my wallet.,104
1246,Fry,"Hey, that's my old bank. Maybe my account's still open.",104
1247,Teller,"Hmm. We don't seem to have your retina scan, your fingerprint or your colonic map on file.",105
1248,Fry,"Yeah, well, I did open the account over a thousand years ago. What about my ATM card?",105
1249,Teller,Do you still remember your PIN number?,105
1250,Fry,"Sure! It's the price of a cheese pizza and a large soda back where I used to work, Panucci's Pizza.",105
1251,Teller,"OK, you had a balance of 93 cents...",105
1252,Fry,Alright!,105
1253,Teller,"And at an average of two-and-a-quarter percent interest over a period of 1000 years, that comes to ... $4.3 billion.",105
1254,Hermes,To Fry.,106
1255,Amy,Cheers!,106
1256,Leela,"I know Fry's rich, but do we really have to wear these top hats?",106
1257,Bender,"Maybe you don't understand just how rich he is. In fact, I think I'd better put on a monocle.",106
1258,Fry,Pizza dinner on me!  Just keep the tab under $50 million.,109
1259,Robot Chef,Yo!  I haven't got all day. What kind of pizza yous guys want?,109
1260,Fry,"Uh, yeah. We'll have one with everything but anchovies and one with my all time favourite topping, anchovies!",109
1261,Robot Chef,"Invalid selection.  Yo, what are you talking about?",109
1262,Fry,Anchovies? You know? Those little headless fish?,109
1263,Robot Chef,Does not compute. Does not compute.,109

1265,Fry,What?,109
1266,Farnsworth,"Oh, my, yes. Fished to death. Just about the time your people arrived on Earth wasn't it, Zoidberg?",109
1267,Zoidberg,I'm not on trial here.,109
1268,Fry,"So none of you has ever had anchovies? Oh, man! You don't know what you're missing. They were all salty and oily and they melted in your mouth and--",109
1269,Zoidberg,"Stop! Stop! I admit it! My people ate them all! We kept saying ""One more can't hurt"" and then they were gone. We're sorry!",109
1270,Fry,I just wish I could've showed you guys how great they were. I may be rich but I still can't buy back all the things I miss from the 20th century.,109
1271,Bender,Maybe you're forgetting just how rich you are.  Huh? Huh?,109
1272,Fry,So? What do you think?,111
1273,Leela,"I know you spent a lot of money on this place, Fry, but it's awfully primitive.  The floors are made of such hard wood.",111
1274,Bender,Hey! Get a load of this pathetic 20th century TV!,111
1275,Fry,What's wrong with it?,111
1276,Bender,"Well, aside from causing eye cancer, these things had a lousy low-definition picture.",111

1283,Bender,"Ah, leave him alone, Leela. So he's going a little wacko with his money. It's OK.",112

1311,Bidder #1,Isn't she adorable?,112
1312,Bidder #2,Isn't she sweet?,112
1313,Auctioneer,What a class act! Sold! To the gentleman who bought every item in today's auction.,112
1314,Fry,Now for some good old 20th century TV.,113
1315,Announcer,Do you remember a time when chocolate chip cookies came fresh from the oven? Petridge Farm remembers.,113
1316,Fry,"Ah, those were the days.",113

1320,Leela,You haven't been to work in three days. What have you been doing?,113

1322,Leela,You can't just sit here in the dark listening to classical music.,113
1323,Fry,I could if you hadn't turned on the lights and shut off the stereo.,113

1327,Bender,Yeah! Now are you gonna come to the squid fights with us or sit here wallowing in your prehistoric junk?,113
1328,Fry,"Junk? Maybe you can't understand this, but I've finally found what I need to be happy and it's not friends, it's things.",113
1329,Bender,I'm a thing.,113

1343,Mom,"No, Igner, put that down!",114
1344,Walt,What does this have to do with the anchovies?,114
1345,Mom,I'm getting to the freaking anchovies.  A single drop of the anchovies' natural oil would lubricate 10 robots permanently.,114
1346,Larry,"Wow, it's a shame they went extinct.",114
1347,Mom,"Thank you, Walt. If anyone ever got a hold of anchovy DNA, they could chop out the oil-making gene, stick it in a bunch of Third-World kids and bam! Cheap effective robot oil. Enough to put dear, old Mom out of businness.",114

1377,Anderson,OK. But I'm only doing this so people will take my head seriously as an actress.,116

1557,Merg,Only one. The absolutely flawless recitation from memory of the royal oath. By you.,132
1558,Fry,Will there be cake?,132
1559,Zoidberg,"Yeah, I know.",133
1560,Amy,Hi!,133
1561,Fry,There you go.,133
1562,Gorgak,"And now, get ready to laugh till your sides leak with our planet's foremost political satirist, Florp!",133
1563,Florp,So what is the deal with people from under the orange sun? They're all...  Right? Am I right?,133
1564,Fry,"Oh, yeah! Yeah, he's right!",133
1565,Leela,"Fry, I have to talk to you. You're in terrible danger.",133
1566,Leela,"You see Emperor Plon here?  He met his end when he was drunk by Emperor Strug. And before he could even wipe his mouth, Strug was drunk by Shwab.",134
1567,Fry,So?,134
1568,Leela,Look at all these guys. Do you have any idea what the average length of their reigns was?,134
1569,Fry,"80,000 years?",134
1570,Leela,No. One week.,134
1571,Fry,Damn! I knew you wouldn't have asked unless it was really high or really low.,134
1572,Leela,Every Emperor ascended to power by assassinating the previous one. And guess who's next?,134
1573,Fry,"Well, at least my assassin will get what's coming to him.",134
1574,Leela,"You're in tremendous danger, you idiot! Half of these Emperors were drunk at their own coronation.",134
1575,Fry,"Hey, I plan on having a few brewskis myself.",134
1576,Leela,"No, they were assassinated. In fact, the law says you'll be killed on the spot if you fail to recite the oath from memory.",134
1577,Fry,"Yeah, I was going to thumb through that later.",134
1578,Leela,That is completely reckless. Don't you ever think ahead?,134
1579,Fry,"Hell, no. If I stopped to think ahead, I wouldn't be Emperor. And I wouldn't even be here in the year 3000. It's just like the story of the grasshopper and the octopus. All year long the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter while the octopus mooched off his girlfriend and watched TV. But then the winter came and the grasshopper died and the octopus ate all his acorns and also he got a racecar. Is any of this getting through to you?",134
1580,Leela,I give up! You're gonna get yourself killed and this time I won't be here to save you.,134
1581,Fry,"Who asked you to? I told you a hundred times to stop treating me like a baby. Now go. Go gather your nuts, you nagging grasshopper.",134
1582,Leela,"That's it! I'm never helping you again! If anyone except you needs me, I'll be in the ship.",134
1583,Fry,I'll be fine. It's not like anyone's gonna drink me.  Quit it!,134
1584,Merg,"People of Trisol, it is my honour to present your new Emperor.",135
1585,Fry,What up?,135
1586,Merg,Stick to the oath.,135
1587,Fry,"Right! I, Fry, who drank Bont the Viscous, who drank Ungo the Moist, who guzzled Zorn the Stagnant...",135
1588,Fry,"Who slurped Hudge the Dewy, who enjoyed a soup composed principally of Throm the Chunky, do solemnly swear to rule with honour and insanity-- Uh, integrity!",135
1589,Merg,"Congratulations, Your Highness.  I now present you with your royal unisex robe. Long live Fry the Solid!",135
1590,Bender,"Hey, look. The suns are setting. I can finally switch to hard liquor!",135
1591,Bender,"Check out the glowing freaks. It's beautiful! Hey, what's that?",135
1592,Merg,The Emperor Bont! He's still alive.,135
1593,Bont,Of course I'm alive. Now cut this creep open and drain me out!,135
1594,Fry,My tummy hurts!,135
1595,Bont,"They're over here, they're running up the stairs.",135
1596,Bender,"Shut up, you!",135
1597,Fry,Ow!,135
1598,Merg,Let us in!,135
1599,Merg,Fry must die so that Bont may live.,135
1600,Fry,What am I gonna do?,135
1601,Amy,We've gotta get the Emperor out of your body before they kill you!,135
1602,Zoidberg,"Relax, Fry. I'll simply spin you in a high-speed centrifuge, separating out the denser fluid of His Highness.",135
1603,Fry,But won't that crush my bones?,135
1604,Zoidberg,"Oh, right, right, with the bones! I always forget about the bones.",135
1605,Bender,"Hey, why don't you just sweat him out?",135
1606,Bont,Forget it! As Emperor I refuse to be dripped out through somebody's armpit.,135
1607,Fry,I could vomit or urinate. Would you feel better about that?,135
1608,Bont,Slightly. But my favourite so far is the bone-crushing.,135
1609,Amy,What about crying?,135
1610,Fry,That's a great idea! Crying.,135
1611,Bont,Fine. That or the bone one.,135
1612,Merg,"Keep it up, men. The veneer is starting to peel.",135
1613,Gorgak,"Oh, dear!",135
1614,Fry,It's no use. I wanna cry but I'm just too macho.,135
1615,Bender,"I'll make you cry, buddy!  You're a pimple on society's ass and you'll never amount to anything.",135
1616,Fry,What do you mean? I was Emperor of a whole planet.,135
1617,Bender,Good point. But here's a disturbing reminder,135
1618,Fry,These things happen.,135
1619,Bender,"OK, Fry, grab a Kleenex for this one, 'cause there's no God and your idiotic human ideals are laughable!",135
1620,Fry,Phew! That's a load off my mind.,135
1621,Bender,"Man, I guess it's harder than I thought to make someone cry.",135
1622,Amy,"You did your best, Bender.",135
1623,Bender,"Up yours, bimbo!",135
1624,Zoidberg,"Let's face it, we're in hot butter here. We should call Leela for help.",135
1625,Bender,"Cram it, lobster!  That is a good idea. I'll go call her.",135
1626,Fry,She'll never help me. She's still mad that I told her never to help me.,135
1627,Amy,C'mon. Leela's not the type to hold a grudge.,135
1628,Operator,Collect call from...,136
1629,Bender,I'm not giving my name to a machine.,136
1630,Leela,I'll accept.,136
1631,Bender,Fry's in trouble...,136
1632,Bender,"And he needs help. Now, I don't like you and you don't like me.",136
1633,Leela,I like you.,136
1634,Bender,"You do? Look, are you going to help or not?",136
1635,Leela,I don't know why I should. I mean after what he--,136
1636,Bender,"Wait, wait, wait, wait.  What is it you like best about me?",136
1637,Amy,Is she coming?,137
1638,Bender,I'm not sure. But I do know that she likes my in-your-face attitude.,137
1639,Fry,What the hell is that?,137
1640,Bont,"Its the Juice-A-Matic 4000. It'll strain my juices from you while filtering out the pulp. By which I mean, your shredded remains.",137
1641,Zoidberg,Of course! Why didn't I think of that!,137
1642,Fry,This is the saddest day of my life. And I still can't cry.,137
1643,Bender,Wait a second. Here comes Leela.,137
1644,Amy,"Oh, no! They have her totally outnumbered.",137
1645,Fry,I can't believe it. She's risking her life for me after the way I treated her. I don't deserve this. I feel terrible.,137
1646,Bender,You do? Hmm.,137
1647,Fry,Is she alright?,137
1648,Bender,"I don't know. Perhaps I'll look out this window. Oh, dear God in heaven, they're swarming all over her.",137
1649,Fry,No. No!,137
1650,Amy,"What are you talking about, Bender? She's al--   Oh!",137
1651,Bender,"They're strapping her to juicer. Oh, they're putting some ice cubes in the glass under it.",137
1652,Fry,This can't be happening.,137
1653,Bender,"It can and, for all you know, it is.  I'm sorry, Fry. She's dead.",137
1654,Fry,"All Leela ever wanted to do was help me. But I was to proud, too stupid to accept it.  I wish I had died instead of her.",137
1655,Leela,What are you talking about?,137
1656,Fry,Leela! You're alive!,137
1657,Leela,Of course I'm alive.,137
1658,Bender,I told Fry you were dead so he would cry out the Emperor but you had to go and wreck it by surviving.,137
1659,Amy,We only got two drops.,137
1660,Bont,It's only a matter of time now.,137
1661,Zoidberg,I'll handle this!,137
1662,Leela,"Listen, Fry, I think I can get us out of this if you're willing to let me help you.",137
1663,Fry,"Thanks, Leela. From now on, I'll take all the help you're willing to give. I know you just want what's best for me.  That hurt!",137
1664,Leela,"I know. Amy, get the bottle.",137
1665,Fry,"Oh, now I understand.",137
1666,Leela,Come on. Everybody help out Fry.,137
1667,Fry,"Thanks, everybody. I love you all. You guys are true-- Ow! Cut it out, Bender! That's a tender area!",137
1668,Leela,"How we doing, Amy?",137
1669,Amy,Great! We're one-tenth of the way there.,137
1670,Amy,"OK, it's your turn.",137
1671,Fry,"Hey, wait a minute! Who are you?",137
1672,Bont,I'm the Emperor! Thanks for crying me out.,137
1673,Fry,"Oh, you're welcome.",137
1674,Bender,Hey! Save some for me!,137
1675,Farnsworth,"Good news, everyone. Tomorrow you'll be making a delivery to Ebola 9, the virus planet.",138
1676,Hermes,Why can't they go today?,138
1677,Farnsworth,Because tonight's a special night and I want all of you to be alive. It's the Academy of Inventors' annual symposium.,138
1678,Fry,Wow! I love symposia.,138
1679,Farnsworth,It's the event of the scientific season. Every member presents an invention and the best one wins the Academy prize.,138
1680,Bender,Sounds boring.,138
1681,Farnsworth,"Oh, my, yes. But not this year, because my latest invention is unbeatable. Behold! The death clock.  Simply jam your finger in the hole and this read-out tells you exactly how long you have left to live.",138
1682,Leela,Does it really work?,138
1683,Farnsworth,Well it's occasionally off by a few seconds. What with free will and all.,138
1684,Fry,Sounds like fun. How long do I have left to live?,138
1685,Bender,Ooh! Dibs on his CD player!,138
1686,Farnsworth,"Oh, my, yes.",139
1687,Fry,Who's the gross nerd?,139
1688,Farnsworth,"That's me at the very first symposium. I'm the Academy's oldest living member, you know. These youngsters all look up to me.",139
1689,Wernstrom,"Well, well, well. Look who decided to show his wrinkled face.",139
1690,Farnsworth,"Why don't you just leave me alone, Wernstrom?",139
1691,Wernstrom,"Face it, Farnsworth, you're over the hill. It's time to leave science to the 120-year-olds.",139
1692,Farnsworth,You young turks think you know everything. I was inventing things when you were barely turning senile.,139
1693,Wernstrom,"Go home before you embarrass yourself, old man. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to take a nap before the ceremonies.",139
1694,Fry,Who's that jerk?,139
1695,Farnsworth,"A hundred years ago he was my most promising student at Mars University. But then, after one fateful pop-quiz...",139
1696,Wernstrom,A-minus? No one gives Ogden Wernstrom an A-minus!,139
1697,Farnsworth,"I'm sorry, but penmanship counts.",139
1698,Wernstrom,I swear I'll have my revenge even if it takes me a hundred years.,139
1699,Farnsworth,And here it is,139
1700,Bender,"I've been perusing your fortified wine list and I've selected the '71 Hobo's Delight, the '57 Chateau Parté and the '66 Thunder Chevitz.",140
1701,Waiter,"Exquisite choices, sir.",140
1702,Bender,And mix them all together in a big jug.,140
1703,Popeil,"Welcome to this year's Academy of Inventors Annual Symposium. I'm your host, Ron Popeil, inventor of Mr. Microphone, the spray-on toupee and, of course, the technology to keep human heads alive in jars.  But wait, there's more. We've got a whole line-up of inventors tonight, starting with that up and coming young star, Ogden Wernstrom.",140
1704,Bender,More wine!,140
1705,Wernstrom,"Distinguished members of the Academy, I present to you, the Reverse Scuba Suit. Observe!  Bad fish!",140
1706,Fry,"Don't worry, Professor, it's no competition for your death clock.",140
1707,Wernstrom,"And what will you be presenting this evening, grandpa?",140
1708,Farnsworth,Let's just say it'll put you young whippersnappers in your place!,140
1709,Wernstrom,I just hope it's not as lame as that death clock you presented last year.,140
1710,Farnsworth,"Uh, last year, you say?",140
1711,Wernstrom,That's right.,140
1712,Farnsworth,"Oh, my! Did it put you young whippersnappers in your place?",140
1713,Wernstrom,"Hardly! We laughed until our teeth fell out. Come along, Cinnamon.",140
1714,Farnsworth,"Oh, dear. I'll have to invent something new in the next ten minutes. Perhaps some sort of death clock.",140
1715,Leela,"Uh, Professor...?",140
1716,Popeil,"Our last presentation comes from our oldest member, Professor Hubert Farnsworth. Professor?",140
1717,Farnsworth,"Just a second, just a second.",140
1718,Wernstrom,"Pencils down, prune-face.",140
1719,Farnsworth,"Uh, yes, here I am, OK, now, hello there. Now, we all know telescopes allow us to see distant objects. But what if we want to smell distant objects? Well now we can! Thanks to my new invention ... the Smellescope.",140
1720,Man,"Oh, I say!",140
1721,Farnsworth,"The odour travels past this coffee stain here, around the olive pit and into this cigar burn. And this appears to be a doodle of myself as a cowboy.  Oh, my!",140
1722,Wernstrom,"I've waited a hundred years for this, Farnsworth. I give your invention the worst grade imaginable",140
1723,Popeil,"And now for the presentation of the award. Listen, folks, I'm practically giving this prize away to Dr. Wernstrom, for his fish thingy.",140
1724,Farnsworth,Perhaps 149 is just too old to be a scientist.,141
1725,Bender,Yep!,141
1726,Fry,"No, Professor, don't give up. There were plenty of times in my century when I was gonna give up but I never did. Never! Hey, are you even listening to me? Oh, I give up!",141
1727,Farnsworth,"By God, you're right! I'm going to build that Smellescope!",141
1728,Farnsworth,Eureka!,142
1729,Fry,Did you build the Smellescope?,142
1730,Farnsworth,"No, I remembered that I'd built one last year. Go ahead, try it. You'll find that every heavenly body has its own particular scent. Here, I'll point it at Jupiter.",142
1731,Fry,Smells like strawberries.,142
1732,Farnsworth,Exactly! And now Saturn.,142
1733,Fry,"Pine needles. Oh, man, this is great! Hey, as long as you don't make me smell Uranus.",142
1734,Leela,I don't get it.,142
1735,Farnsworth,"I'm sorry, Fry, but astronomers renamed Uranus in 2620 to end that stupid joke once and for all.",142
1736,Fry,Oh. What's it called now?,142
1737,Farnsworth,"Urectum. Here, let me locate it for you.",142
1738,Fry,"No, no, I think I'll just smell around a bit over here!  Hmm.",142
1739,Farnsworth,"What is it?  Oh, jeez! Oh, man! Remarkable! A stench so foul it's right off the Funk-o-Meter. I dare say Fry may have discovered the smelliest object in the known universe.",142
1740,Bender,Ooh! Ooh! Name it after me!,142
1741,Leela,I think it's moving.,142
1742,Farnsworth,"Hmm. Perhaps the computer can calculate its trajectory.  My God! Whatever it is, it's headed straight for us. With enough force to reduce this entire city to a stinky crater. We have less than 72 hours.",142
1743,Bender,"Well, let's get looting!",142
1744,Fry,So this thing's gonna destroy the whole city?  What the heck is it?,143
1745,Farnsworth,Ah! Just as I thought. The answer lies in this movie I found on the Internet.,143
1746,Narrator,"The repulsive barge circled the oceans for 50 years but no country would accept it, not even that really filthy one. You know the one I mean. Finally, in 2052, the city used its mob connections to obtain a rocket and launch the garbage into outer space. Some experts claim the ball might return to Earth someday, but their concerns were dismissed as ""depressing"".",143
1747,Fry,Wow! You got that off the Internet?  In my day the Internet was only used to download pornography.,143
1748,Farnsworth,Actually that's still true.,143
1749,Female Scientist,"Now that the garbage is in space, doctor, perhaps you can help me with my sexual inhibitions.",143
1750,Male Scientist,With gusto!,143
1751,Farnsworth,"So that's the situation. Due to the short-sightedness of Old New York, New New York is going to be destroyed by a giant ball of garbage.",143
1752,Leela,"Fry, what the hell were you people thinking back then? How could you just throw your garbage away?",143
1753,Fry,"Hey, gimmie a break! What do you do with it?",143
1754,Leela,We recycle everything. Robots are made from old beer cans.,143
1755,Bender,Yeah! And this beer can is made outta old robots.,143
1756,Leela,And that sandwich you're eating is made of old discarded sandwiches.  Nothing just gets thrown away.,143
1757,Fry,The future is disgusting.,143
1758,Leela,Typical 20th century attitude.,143
1759,Fry,"Hey! You have no right to criticise the 20th century. We gave the world the lightbulb, the steamboat and the cotton gin.",143
1760,Leela,Those things are all from the 19th century.,143
1761,Fry,"Yeah, well, they probably just copied us.",143
1762,Farnsworth,Please! There's no time for this now. This is an emergency. We must warn the mayor.,143
1763,Poopenmeyer,"Garbage ball, huh? That sounds serious.",144
1764,Farnsworth,"Very serious, Mayor Poopenmeyer.",144
1765,Poopenmeyer,I gotta be sure this isn't another scientific fraud like global warming or second-hand smoke.  Send in my science advisor.,144
1766,Farnsworth,Wernstrom!,144
1767,Wernstrom,"Well, well, well! Come to present your latest napkin, Professor?",144
1768,Farnsworth,"No, I'm here because a giant trash ball is heading straight for us. Smell for yourself.",144
1769,Poopenmeyer,Hey! Holy jeez!,144
1770,Wernstrom,"That smell could be anything; a faulty stench coil, some cheese on the lens, who knows?",144
1771,Woman,"Mr. Mayor, we just got this transmission from Neptune.",144
1772,Man,... passed close by ... horrible stench.,144
1773,Woman,"The transmission cuts out there, sir.  No, I, guess it keeps going.",144
1774,Woman,There we go.,144
1775,Poopenmeyer,My God! The senile old man is right.,144
1776,Wernstrom,Do you mean him or me?,144
1777,Poopenmeyer,Him!,144
1778,[Scene,"New New York City Street. People crowd around a shop watching TV's through the window. On the TV, two newscasters present a report on ""Root""2 News. One is a blonde human woman wearing a pink suit and the other is an alien that looks like one from",145
1779,Linda,"Next, New New York in crisis. Morbo?",145
1780,Morbo,"Thanks, human female. Puny Earthlings were shocked today to learn that a ball of garbage will destroy their pathetic city of New New York.",145
1781,Linda,Makes me glad we live here in Los Angeles.,145
1782,Morbo,Morbo agrees!,145
1783,Leela,Can't we just shoot a missile at it?,146
1784,Military Man,We've simulated that on a supercomputer but the ball is just too damn gooey. A missile would go right through it.,146
1785,Farnsworth,But suppose we send a crew to plant an explosive precisely on the fault line between this mass of coffee grounds and this deposit of America Online floppy disks.,146
1786,Military Man,"In theory, it could work.",146
1787,Wernstrom,"Uh, in theory, perhaps. But you'll never find a crew willing to take on a mission so suicidally dangerous.",146
1788,Bender,"Oh, crap!",146
1789,Farnsworth,"Now, you'll only have one chance to destroy the ball. After that, it will be so close to Earth that blowing it up would cause garbage to rain over the entire planet, killing billions.",147
1790,Bender,"Oh, boo-hoo!",147
1791,Farnsworth,"Now here's the bomb I've prepared. Once you activate it, you'll have 25 minutes to get away.",147
1792,Leela,That's all? But--,147
1793,Farnsworth,"Now, now, there'll be plenty of time to discuss your objections when and if you return.",147
1794,[Scene,The ship clears the atmosphere and flies towards the garbage ball. It looks like the asteroid from,148
1795,Leela,Odour at magnitude 8.  We're breaking up. Turn on the anti-smell device.,149
1796,Fry,"Hmm, sporty!",149
1797,Fry,Wow!,150
1798,Leela,Look at all this filth.,150
1799,Fry,It's not filth. It's a glorious monument to the achievements of the 20th century.  Some Bart Simpson dolls!,150
1800,Doll,Eat my shorts!,150
1801,Bender,OK  Mmm! Shorts!,150
1802,Leela,"Fry, this stuff was garbage when it was new. Let's blow it up already!",150
1803,Fry,This junk isn't garbage! I can dig in any random pile and find something great.,150
1804,Fry,"Alright, let's get to work.",150
1805,Leela,"Let's see. If that's Hypodermic Ridge then the bomb must go right here.  ""6h"" minutes?",150
1806,Bender,There's your problem. The Professor put the counter on upside-down.,150
1807,Leela,"That idiot! It wasn't set for 25 minutes, it was set for 52 seconds.",150
1808,Fry,We're gonna die!  Right?,150
1809,Bender,Right!,150
1810,Bender,It's gonna blow!,150
1811,Leela,"Hey, watch it! You'll put somebody's eye out!",150
1812,Bender,"OK, OK, keep your space pants on. I'll take care of this.",150
1813,Fry,We're saved!,150
1814,Leela,"Yeah, but this garbage ball's unstoppable now. New New York is done for.",150
1815,Linda,"All in all, this is one day Mittens the kitten won't soon forget!",152
1816,Morbo,"Kittens give Morbo gas. In lighter news, the city of New New York is doomed. Blame rests with known human Professor Hubert Farnsworth and his tiny, inferior brain.",152
1817,Farnsworth,"Oh, how could I have put that bomb timer on upside-down? I could swear I followed the manual precisely.  I'm a dried up husk of a scientist. This is all my fault.",152
1818,Fry,"No, it's my fault too. I'm sure I threw out more than my share of that trash up there. Also, one month my toilet broke and it just went straight in the garbage can.  Leela was right. The people of the 20th century were idiotic slobs. Especially me.",152
1819,Poopenmeyer,Enough! You all failed miserably. It's time to put a real scientist in charge.,152
1820,Farnsworth,Wernstrom!,152
1821,Wernstrom,The very same.,152
1822,Poopenmeyer,"Dr. Wernstrom, can you save my city?",152
1823,Wernstrom,Of course. But it'll cost you. First I'll need tenure.,152
1824,Poopenmeyer,Done.,152
1825,Wernstrom,And a big research grant.,152
1826,Poopenmeyer,You got it.,152
1827,Wernstrom,"Also, access to a lab and five graduate students, at least three of them Chinese.",152
1828,Poopenmeyer,"Um, alright done. What's your plan?",152
1829,Wernstrom,"What plan? I'm set for life! Au revoir, suckers!",152
1830,Leela,That rat! Do something!,152
1831,Poopenmeyer,I wish I could but he's got tenure!,152
1832,Poopenmeyer,"It's time to take action.  Well, I'm out of ideas. Anyone?",153
1833,Farnsworth,"Wait! If we could build an object the exact size, density and consistency of the garbage ball, it might just knock the ball away without smashing it to bits.",153
1834,Leela,But where can we find a substance the exact density and consistency as garbage?,153
1835,Farnsworth,"Alas, I don't know.",153
1836,Fry,"Uh, what about garbage?",153
1837,Farnsworth,Good Lord! A second ball of garbage! That just might work!,153
1838,Poopenmeyer,But garbage isn't something you just find lying in the streets of Manhattan. This city's been garbage-free for 500 years!,153
1839,Fry,Then it's time to make some more.,153
1840,Poopenmeyer,Make garbage? But how?,153
1841,Fry,Stand back and watch the master! This Slurm can.  Pure garbage. Now you try it.,153
1842,Poopenmeyer,"By God, I think the boy's got something. Come on, everyone! The fate of the city is at stake!",153
1843,Fry,Good!  Very nice.,153
1844,Poopenmeyer,Get that robot some more beer!  We've trashed this room but that's just the start. We've got to get Fry's message to the people.,153
1845,Fry,"People of New New York, take a lesson from the 20th century. Stop all this pain-in-the-ass recycling and throw your garbage on the floor.",154
1846,Fry,Go ahead. Just chuck it any old place like I used to. Your city is counting on you.,155
1847,Farnsworth,"If my calculations are correct, this garbage ball will knock the other garbage ball directly into the sun.",157
1848,Wernstrom,"And if my calculations are correct, we're all going to die horribly.",157
1849,Poopenmeyer,"Alright, places everyone. Prepare for launch.",157
1850,Farnsworth,"Five, four, three, two, three, four, five, six...",157
1851,Leela,Just fire the damn thing.,157
1852,Fry,Oops!,157
1853,Farnsworth,Burning garbage!,159
1854,Fry,It worked!,159
1855,Poopenmeyer,"And so, on behalf of the entire city, I thank you, Professor Farnsworth. I now present you with the Academy prize, which we confiscated from Dr. Wernstrom after it became apparent that he was a jackass.",160
1856,Farnsworth,"Yes! In your face, Wernstrom!",160
1857,Wernstrom,"I'll get you, Farnsworth. Even if it takes me another hundred years.",160
1858,Poopenmeyer,"And, Fry, we owe you a tremendous debt as well. If not for your 20th century garbage-making skills, we'd all be buried under 20th century garbage.",160
1859,Leela,"Should we really be celebrating? I mean, what if the second garbage ball returns to Earth like the first one did?",160
1860,Fry,Who cares? That won't be for hundreds of years.,160
1861,Farnsworth,Exactly! It's none of our concern.,160
1862,Fry,That's the 20th century spirit!,160
1863,Fry,This is awesome! I've been waiting a thousand years to see a Beastie Boys show.,161
1864,Bender,Can I get anybody a beer?,161
1865,Fry,Sure!,161
1866,Announcer,"Ladies and gentlemen, here to lay down some old, old, incredibly old school beats",161
1867,Beastie Boys,"Well now don't you tell to smile,You stick around,,I'll make it worth your whileGot numbers beyond what you can dial,Maybe it's because I'm so versatile,Style profile I said,It always brings me back when I hear Wu Child...",161
1868,Leela,Impressive. They're busting mad rhymes with an 80% success rate.,161
1869,Bender,I believe that qualifies as ill. At least from a technical standpoint.,161
1870,Fry,Will you guys shut up! I'm trying to look cool.,161
1871,Beastie Boys,"...known for the Flintstone FlopTammy D gettin' biz on the crop,Beastie Boys know to let the beat...",161
1872,Mike,Drop!  Don't forget to pick up a T-shirt!,161
1873,Fry,"Wow! An old-fashioned mosh pit! Come on, guys. Tonight we're gonna party like its 1999 ... again.",161
1874,Beastie Boys,Well it's 50 cups of coffee and you know it's onI move the crowd to the break of break of dawn...,161
1875,Leela,"Ow! Hey, watch it!",161
1876,Fry,"Man, these guys rock harder than ever!",161
1877,Mike,"Oh, my...",161
1878,MCA,It's a mirage...,161
1879,Ad-Rock,Tellin' you all it's a...,161
1880,Beastie Boys,Sabotage!,161
1881,Ad-Rock,"Sabotage, yeah!",161
1882,Mike,"Peace, we out!",161
1883,Fender,"Hey, Bender!",161
1884,Bender,"Hey, Fender! Man, I haven't seen you since high school. You still workin' at Jack In The Box?",161
1885,Fender,"Not anymore, baby. I'm with the band!",161
1886,Mike,"Aw! Oh, yeah!",162
1887,Fender,"Hey, fellas, hey. I want you to meet my friends, Bender, Fry and Leela.",162
1888,Ad-Rock,"Y'know, we're really not that interested in meeting them.",162
1889,Fry,"Wow! I love you guys! Back in the 20th century, I had all five of your albums.",162
1890,Ad-Rock,That was a thousand years ago. Now we got seven.,162
1891,Fry,Cool! Can I borrow the new ones? And a couple of blank tapes?,162
1892,Fender,"Hey, Bender, why don't we ditch these organ sacks and hit the real party?",162
1893,Bender,Count me in! I'm gonna drink till I reboot!,162
1894,Bender,"Hey, what kinda party is this? There's no booze and only one hooker.",163
1895,Fender,"Don't be a drag, man. We're jacking on!  Wanna jolt?",163
1896,Bender,"Uh, hey, I'm no square but isn't that counter-indicated by my operations manual?",163
1897,Robot,Counter indicated!,163
1898,Fender,"Come on, Bender, grab a jack. I told these guys you were cool.",163
1899,Bender,"Well, if jacking on'll make strangers think I'm cool, I'll do it!",163
1900,Fender,"Easy, baby. You don't wanna get hooked on this stuff.",163
1901,Bender,"Eh, no need to worry. I don't have an addictive personality.",163
1902,Fry,"Hey, uh, Bender? What are we doing in this bad neighbourhood?",164
1903,Bender,"Shut up, square!  I'll just be a minute!",164
1904,Preacherbot,Wretched sinner unit! The path to robot heaven lies here ...  ... in The Good Book 3.0.,164
1905,Bender,Hey! Do I preach to you when you're lying stoned in the gutter? No! So beat it!,164
1906,Fry,Who was that guy?,164
1907,Bender,Your mama! Now shut up and drag me to work!,164
1908,Hermes,Our electric bill's climbing faster than a green snake up a sugar cane. Obviously someone round been wastin' a whole heap a juice! Probably you!,165
1909,Zoidberg,Me?,165
1910,Amy,"Good morning, Bender.",165
1911,Bender,None of your business! Get off my back!,165
1912,Amy,What's his problem?,165
1913,Leela,If I didn't know better I'd almost think he was abusing electricity.,165
1914,Fry,Bender? No way!  I definitely would've noticed something.,165
1915,Leela,"Bender, why are you spending so much time in the bathroom? Are you jacking on in there?",165
1916,Bender,No! Don't come in!,165
1917,Farnsworth,"Good news, everyone! Today you'll be delivering a crate of subpoenas to Sicily 8, the Mob Planet!",165
1918,Bender,"Alright, let's get to work! I'll be out in a second.",165
1919,Fry,I know Big Vinnie said he was giving me the kiss of death but I still think he was gay.,166
1920,Leela,Did he use his tongue?,166
1921,Fry,"A little.  You OK, Bender?",166
1922,Bender,None of your business! Get off my back!,166
1923,Leela,Uh-oh. There seems to be some sort of electrical disturbance in the Coalsack Nebula.,166
1924,Bender,A what kind of disturbance?,166
1925,Leela,"Electrical. Anyway, it's going to take some careful piloting to avoid it.",166
1926,Leela,We're out of control. We're heading straight into the electric field!,166
1927,Fry,What's happening? I-I feel weird!,166
1928,Bender,"Come on, universe, you big, mostly empty wuss! Gimmie all the juice you got!  Oh, mama!",166
1929,Bender,What?,167
1930,Leela,"Bender, we didn't mind your drinking, or your kleptomania, or your pornography ring.",168
1931,Zoidberg,"In fact, that's why we loved you.",168
1932,Leela,But this electricity abuse crossed the line. You almost killed us.,168
1933,Fry,And you made me feel like a jerk for trusting you. Just like when my friend Richie swore he wasn't taking drugs and then he sold me my mom's VCR and then later I found out he was taking drugs. You make me ashamed to be your friend.,168
1934,Bender,You're right. I'm a lost cause.,168
1935,Bender,Maybe there's another way.,169
1936,Bender,"Oh, yeah, that's the good stuff.  What am I doing? What have I become? Huh?",169
1937,Preacherbot,"I see a lot of fancy robots here today, made of real shiny metal. But that don't impress the Robot Devil, no, sir!",169
1938,Vergerbot,"No, sir!",169
1939,Preacherbot,"'Cause if you're a sinner, he's gonna plug his infernal modem in the wall, belchin' smoke and flame. And he's gonna download you straight to Robot Hell!",169
1940,Vergerbot,Straight to hell!,169
1941,Preacherbot,So I ask you,169
1942,Bender,Me.,169
1943,Hermes,"And as a further cost-cutting measure, I have eliminated the salt-water cooler.",170
1944,Zoidberg,This is a witch hunt!,170
1945,Bender,"Oh, what a beautiful morning,Oh what a beautiful day! Greetings, friends. Don't we all look nice today?",170
1946,Fry,Great! He's whacked out on electricity again.,170
1947,Bender,"No, I'm whacked out on life. My friends, I found religion.",170
1948,Fry,Religion? Is this another scam to get free yarmulkes?,170
1949,Leela,"Give him a break, Fry. If this helps Bender clean up his act then I think we should be supportive.",170
1950,Farnsworth,Yes.,170
1951,Amy,"Oh, yeah.",170
1952,Hermes,"Oh, yes!",170
1953,Zoidberg,"Oh, yeah.",170
1954,Bender,"Wonderful. Then you'll all come to my exceedingly long, un-air-conditioned baptism ceremony!",170
1955,Preacherbot,"We are gathered here today to deliver brother Bender from the cold, steel grip of the Robot Devil unto the cold, steel bosom of our congregation.",171
1956,Robot #2,"Tell it, Preacher!",171
1957,Robot #3,That equals true.,171
1958,Preacherbot,"Brother Bender, do you accept the principles of Robotology on pain of eternal damnation in Robot Hell?",171
1959,Bender,"Yes, I do.",171
1960,Preacherbot,Then I will now baptise you.  Press any key to continue.,171
1961,Bender,"Uh, while you're at it, could you touch up this seam?",171
1962,Leela,This is unbelievable. The old Bender never would have taken us out to dinner.,172
1963,Bender,The old Bender's gone. He won't trouble you anymore.,172
1964,Waiter,Would monsieur care to see the wine list?,172
1965,Bender,"No poison for us, thanks. I'll stick with good old mineral oil.  Ah! Functional!",172
1966,Hermes,"Mon, I'm hungrier than a green snake in a sugar cane field!",172
1967,Bender,Friends! Friends! Surely you're not going to eat before we say Robot Grace?  In the name of all that is good and logical we give thanks for the chemical energy we are about to absorb. To quote the prophet Jerematic,172
1968,Bender,...0010110012. Amen.,172
1969,Fry,Does that mean we can eat now?,172
1970,Bender,"Yes.  But first, since I love you all so much, I'd like to give everyone hugs. Come here, Fry!",172
1971,Fry,"Oh, uh, but I don't want to.",172
1972,Bender,"Mmm! Mmm! Fry, you're my friend!  Come on, everyone line up for a hug. Let's tear down some emotional walls.",172
1973,Leela,What are you doing to my ship?,173
1974,Bender,Sanctifying it!  There! That ought to convert a few tailgaters.,173
1975,Fry,Bender's stupid religion is driving me nuts.,173
1976,Leela,Amen.,173
1977,Farnsworth,If only he had joined a mainstream religion like Oprah-ism or Voodoo.,173
1978,Fry,We've got to get the old Bender back.,173
1979,Leela,"And I think I know a way to do it. We have to reacquaint him with a little thing called ""sleaze"".",173
1980,Bender,I can't believe somebody hired an interstellar spaceship to deliver a package to Atlantic City. What are we delivering anyway?,174
1981,Fry,"Uh, this.",174
1982,Bender,Where are we delivering it to?,174
1983,Leela,"Uh, here.",174
1984,Bender,Another job well done. Now back to the office for an enjoyable evening of fasting and repentance.,174
1985,Fry,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, Bender. So long as we're here why don't we take in some exotic dancing?",174
1986,Leela,"Hey, great idea!",174
1987,Bender,But ... those girls don't wear cases. You can see their bare circuits.,174
1988,Fry,"Come on, it'll be fun! Maybe we could even drink a little fortified wine.",174
1989,Bender,What? Drinking wine is a sin. Even if it is deliciously fortified.,174
1990,Leela,"Hey, Bender, look at that woman's purse. It's hanging by a spaghetti strand.",174
1991,Bender,Thou shalt not snatch.,174
1992,Fry,And there's Hookerbot 5000. She's got a heart of solid gold!,174
1993,Hookerbot,"Hey, sailing unit!",174
1994,Bender,Stop tempting me! For once in my life I have inner peace.,174
1995,Fry,"Pfft! That's for losers. C'mon, sin your heart out.",174
1996,Leela,Go nuts.,174
1997,Hookerbot,Live a little.,174
1998,Woman,Could you hold my purse for a minute?,174
1999,Fry,"Go for it, Bender. You know you wanna!",174
2000,Bender,Well...,174
2001,Bender,I'm the greatest.  Woo-hoo!,175
2002,Fry,Look's like we got the old Bender back!,175
2003,Bender,"You know it, pork pie! Except for one thing.",175
2004,Bender,"Y'know, as a major Hollywood director, I'll be holding auditions tonight for my next movie. And even though you're all young and naive, I think you might just have what it takes.  No! No!",176
2005,Robot Devil,"Greetings, Bender! Welcome to Robot Hell.",177
2006,Leela,What in hell happened to Bender?,178
2007,Fry,"Well he didn't check out. The ashtray's still here.  Look, Nibbler's caught the scent of vodka and motor oil! Go, boy. Follow that stench.",178
2008,Bender,"I'm hallucinating this, right?",179
2009,Robot Devil,"No, Bender. Robot Hell is quite real. Here's our brochure.",179
2010,Bender,But I don't belong here. I don't like things that are scary and painful.,179
2011,Robot Devil,"Sorry, Bender, you agreed to this when you joined our religion. If you sin you go to Robot Hell, for all eternity.",179
2012,Bender,"Aw, hell-- I mean ""heck""!",179
2013,Robot Devil,"It's alright, you can say that here.",179
2014,Fry,Wait! I remember this place. They shut it down after all those people caught salmonella from the flume ride.,180
2015,Leela,Hmm. Look! It's the symbol of Bender's old religion.,180
2016,Fry,"Unbelievable. It's an actual, factual Robot Hell.",180
2017,Leela,Who would've thought hell would really exist? And that it would be in New Jersey!,180
2018,Fry,Actually--,180
2019,Robot Devil,"We know all your sins, Bender. And for each one we've prepared an agonising and ironic punishment. Gentlemen?",181
2020,Bender,"Aw, crap, singing. Mind if I smoke?",181
2021,Robot Devil,"Cigars are evil,You won't miss 'em,We'll find ways to simulate that smell,What a sorry fella,Rolled up and smoked like a panatela,Here on level one of Robot Hell!",181
2022,Robot Devil,"Gambling's wrong and so is cheating,So is forging phoney IOU's,Let's let Lady Luck decide,What type of torture's justified,I'm pit boss here on level two!",181
2023,Robot Devil,Ooh! Deep-fried robot!,181
2024,Bender,Just tell me why.,181
2025,Robot Devil,Please read this 55-page warrant.,181
2026,Bender,There must be robots worse than I.,181
2027,Robot Devil,"We've checked around, there really aren't.",181
2028,Bender,"Then please let me explain,My crimes were merely boy-ish pranks.",181
2029,Robot Devil,"You stole from boy scouts, nuns and banks!",181
2030,Bender,"Ah, don't blame me,Blame my upbringing!",181
2031,Robot Devil,Please stop sinning while I'm singing!,181
2032,Robot Devil,"Selling bootleg tapes is wrong,Musicians need that income to survive.",181
2033,Beastie Boys,"Hey, Bender, gonna make some noise,With your hard drive scratched by the Beastie Boys!That's whatcha, whatcha, whatcha get on level five!",181
2034,Fry,I don't feel well.,181
2035,Leela,It's up to us to rescue him.,181
2036,Fry,Maybe he likes it here in Hell.,181
2037,Leela,It's us who tempted him to sin.,181
2038,Fry,Maybe he's back at the motel.,181
2039,Leela,"Come on, Fry, don't be scared,I'm sure at least one of us will be spared,So just sit back, enjoy the ride.",181
2040,Fry,My ass has blisters from the slide.,181
2041,Robot Devil,"Fencing diamonds,Fixing cockfights,Publishing indecent magazines,",181
2042,Robot Devil,"You'll pay for every crime,Knee-deep in electric slime,You'll suffer till the end of time,Enduring torture's, most of which rhyme,Trapped forever here in Robot Hell!",181
2043,Robot Devil,"Of course, that's just for starters.",181
2044,Fry,"Bender, are you alright?",181
2045,Bender,"No! Oh, they're tormenting me with up-tempo singing and dancing.",181
2046,Leela,"Alright, Beelzebot, what'll it take to get our friend back?",181
2047,Robot Devil,"Sorry, but I hold all the cards here. There's nothing I can do. Now, if you'll just sign this fiddle contest waiver.",181
2048,Leela,Wait. What fiddle contest?,181
2049,Robot Devil,"The Fairness In Hell Act of 2275 requires me to inform you that if you can best me in a fiddle contest, you win back Bender's soul. As well as a solid gold fiddle.",181
2050,Fry,Wouldn't a solid gold fiddle weigh hundreds of pounds and sound crummy?,181
2051,Robot Devil,Well it's mostly for show.,181
2052,Leela,Do you know how to play the fiddle?,181
2053,Fry,No. Do you?,181
2054,Leela,What happens if we lose?,181
2055,Robot Devil,"You'll only win a smaller, silver fiddle. Also I guess I'll kill one of you, uh, him.",181
2056,Leela,We'll do it.,181
2057,Robot Devil,"Very well, then. Beat this.",181
2058,Bender,"Well, we're boned.",181
2059,Robot Devil,Your turn.  Ha!,181
2060,Leela,Time for the drum solo!,181
2061,Fry,Run!,181
2062,Robot Devil,Stop them! They cheated!,181
2063,Leela,"Hurry, Bender!",181
2064,Bender,I could if you'd drop the stupid gold violin!,181
2065,Leela,"Oh, sorry.",181
2066,Bender,"Don't worry, guys, I'll never be too good or too evil again. From now on, I'll just be me.",181
2067,Leela,"Uh, do you think you could be just little less evil than that.",181
2068,Bender,I don't know. Do you think you could survive a 700ft fall?,181
2069,Fry,Good old Bender!,181
2070,Beastie Boys,"Yeah, yeah! This one goes out to my man, Bender,Sending this one out, special dedication,To all my peoples in the robot homeworld,Yeah, yeah! Big up with the Professor,My man, Dr. Zoidberg,I'd like to shout out-- a personal shout out to Leela,Fry! My man, Bender,Nibber, Nibbler, in the house,Big shout out to all Futurama!",181
2071,Leela,That was the worst delivery ever.,182
2072,Fry,"Yeah. I'm never going to another planet called ""Cannibalon""!",182
2073,Bender,"Me neither.  Food was good, though.",182
2074,Farnsworth,"Oh, great news, everyone.",182
2075,Bender,Shove it! We quit!,182
2076,Farnsworth,In that case I'll have to hire a new crew to go on our company vacation.,182
2077,Leela,Vacation?,182
2078,Bender,Alright!,182
2079,Fry,This is great! I haven't had time off since I was 21 through 24.,182
2080,Farnsworth,It's just my way of thanking you for not reporting my countless violations of safety and minimum wage laws.,182
2081,Bender,"Aww, you!",182
2082,Farnsworth,"I've booked us all on the maiden voyage of the largest, most luxurious space cruise ship ever built.  The Titanic!",182
2083,Leela,Looks nice.,182
2084,Fry,"Hey, uh, where's my suitcase?  Ow!",183
2085,Poopenmeyer,"As Mayor of New New York, it's my pleasure to introduce the honorary captain for the Titanic's maiden voyage. A man who single-handedly defeated the Retiree People of the Assisted Living Nebula",184
2086,Leela,"Oh, God! Not Zapp Brannigan!",184
2087,Zoidberg,You know Zapp Brannigan?,184
2088,Leela,"Let's just say we've ""crossed paths"".",184
2089,Bender,Was that before or after you slept with him?,184
2090,Zapp,"She's a beautiful ship, alright. Shapely ... seductive. I'm gonna fly her brains out.  And now, without further adieu, I christen this ship, Titanic.",184
2091,Zapp,"Well, well, well! The Lady Leela. Take notes, Kif. You're about to witness the subtle waltz known as seduction.  So, trapped on a ship with me. What say you and I knock some very sensual boots?",184
2092,Leela,"It's tempting, but, uh, I have a fiancé now. Uh, hmm, uh, hmm, uh, we--, uh ...  Him! Fry, darling, meet Zapp Brannigan.",184
2093,Fry,Huh?  Ooh! How do you do?,184
2094,[Scene,Titanic First Class Corridor. The crew walk across polished floors and past a grand wooden staircase straight out of the film,186
2095,Farnsworth,"Ah, here's my stateroom.",186
2096,Bender,"Come on, where is it?",186
2097,Farnsworth,"Now, Hermes, you and your lovely wife, LaBarbara, have the suite through there. And Dr. Zoidberg, your marble tank is on the other side.",187
2098,Fry,"Man, first class seems nice!",187
2099,Farnsworth,It'll seem even nicer once you've seen your room.,187
2100,Amy,Looks like we're on the Fiesta Deck.,188
2101,Leela,This is it.,189
2102,Fry,Well at least we get a window!,189
2103,Bender,"Well, I'm tired of this room and everyone in it. If you'll excuse me, I'm gonna pop over to the casino for the next 135 hours!",189
2104,Amy,I think I'll go and fill up on bisque at the buffet.,189
2105,Fry,I guess that just leaves you and your fake fianc´ ... all alone ... on a romantic cruise.,189
2106,Leela,Take it off or I'll break it off.,189
2107,Fry,OK!,189
2108,Zapp,Captain's inspection!,189
2109,Bender,"Hmm.  Come on, baby needs a new pair of feet!",190
2110,Croupier,Snake eyes.,190
2111,Bender,No! My cheating unit malfunctioned! You gotta give me a do-over!,190
2112,Croupier,"Sorry, the house limit is three do-overs. Next shooter.",190
2113,Bender,"Gimmie you're biggest, strongest, cheapest drink.",190
2114,iZac,You got it!,190
2115,Bender,Allow me to introduce myself. I'm Bender.,190
2116,Countess,Charmed. I'm the Countess de la Roca. I was surprised to see another robot staying in first class. Most of the robots I meet are labourers.,190
2117,Bender,"I assure you, I barely know the meaning of the word ""labour"".",190
2118,Countess,"Oh, Mr. Bender!",190
2119,Bender,"Please, call me Bender.",190
2120,Countess,"Oh, goodness. I don't--",190
2121,Zapp,"Kif, I'm feeling the captain's itch.",191
2122,Kif,"I'll get the powder, sir.",191
2123,Zapp,"No, the itch for adventure! Prepare to change course.",191
2124,Kif,"Sir, this is a leisure cruise. Our path was set by the travel agency.",191
2125,Zapp,That's for schoolgirls! Now here's a route with some chest hair.,191
2126,Kif,But that course leads directly through a swarm of comets.,191
2127,Zapp,"Yes, comets! The icebergs of the sky. By jack-knifing from one to the next at breakneck speed we might just get some kind of gravity boost ... or something.  Divert power from the shields, full speed ahead!",191
2128,Amy,"Oh, yeah!",192
2129,Mrs. Wong,Amy! Hello!,192
2130,Amy,Mom? Dad? What are you doing here?,192
2131,Mr. Wong,"We were planning on enjoying a relaxing vacation. But since you're here, we'll have to do some meddling.",192
2132,Mrs. Wong,We met the nicest boy in the cabin next to ours.,192
2133,Mr. Wong,He's not very ugly.,192
2134,Mrs. Wong,You should marry him! Or at least use him to conceive a grandchild for us.,192
2135,Mr. Wong,There he is at the buffet!,192
2136,Amy,"Uh, he seems really nice but, well, I already have a boyfriend.",192
2137,Mrs. Wong,Really? Where is he?,192
2138,Mr. Wong,And why isn't he here right now fathering our grandchild?,192
2139,Amy,Uh...,192
2140,Leela,"Well, our accommodations aren't great, but it sure is beautiful out here.",193
2141,Fry,"Yeah, it's pretty romantic-- Uh, I mean platonic. Th-That sure is one platonic view!",193
2142,Leela,"Fry, just be quiet. I'm beginning to think this whole fake fiancé thing was a terrible, terrible--",193
2143,Fry,Hmm? Mmm!,193
2144,Zapp,"Leela, perhaps this is an awkward time but if things don't work out with this pipsqueak here ...  ... I just want you to know I'll be there to score you on the rebound.",193
2145,Leela,"Uh, look, before you get any crazy ideas, that was for Zapp.",193
2146,Fry,"Well, you got anything else for him?",193
2147,Leela,"Alright, can we try not to complicate this?",193
2148,Amy,"Mom, Dad, I'd like you to meet Fry, my boyfriend.",193
2149,Fry,Hmm? Mmm!,193
2150,Fry,"See you later, wuvvums!",193
2151,Leela,It would have been nice if you'd told me you were going out with Amy.,193
2152,Fry,"I'm not going out with Amy. It's just to fool her parents. Hey, you're not jealous, are you?",193
2153,Leela,What? No. No! Of course not!,193
2154,Fry,"Good, 'cause I consider my fake relationship with you a lot more meaningful.",193
2155,Countess,Mind if I freshen up a bit before we go out?,194
2156,Bender,I was just about to suggest the same thing.  Pay dirt!,194
2157,Countess,"Lovely, isn't it?",194
2158,Bender,Yeah. But only 93% as lovely as you.,194
2159,Countess,"Oh, Bender! Either that was a computing error or you're the most romantic robot I've ever met!",194
2160,Bender,"I don't get it, iZac; that bracelet had a diamond the size of a racoon's brain. Why couldn't I steal it?",195
2161,iZac,"It's obvious, Mr. B. You're in love.",195
2162,Bender,"Oh, it's true. But we're star-crossed robots. She, a countess, built with a silver spoon in her mouth. And me, just a regular honest Joe.",195
2163,iZac,"Hey, you gonna pay for those?",195
2164,Bender,"Hell, no!",195
2165,iZac,Security to bar area. Security to bar area.,195
2166,Bender,"Fellas, please. I'm in love!",195
2167,iZac,Rough him up!,195
2168,Countess,What are you doing?,195
2169,iZac,"This penniless chump was stealing drinks, ma'am.",195
2170,Countess,"I see. Here you are, sir.  Keep the change.",195
2171,iZac,You got it!,195
2172,Zoidberg,Aha!,196
2173,Fry,"Go, Professor!",196
2174,Amy,Lean back more!,196
2175,Farnsworth,Ow!,196
2176,LaBarbara,"Come on, Hermes, you could out-limbo all of these people!",196
2177,Hermes,"Don't be a dog heart, woman. You know I can't. Not after what happened.",196
2178,Announcer,"Now limbo-ing for the Earth team, Hermes Conrad.",196
2179,Boy,"You're my hero, Hermes! I'm gonna be just like you!",196
2180,Hermes,"No, boy, stop! It's too low! Your backbone can't take it!",196
2181,Boy,I'm just like Hermes! I'm just like--,196
2182,Hermes,Nooo!,196
2183,LaBarbara,"There, there. Now you don't have to limbo if you don't want. It doesn't make you any less of a man.",196
2184,Farnsworth,Though it did get me some action!,196
2185,Hattie,I like a man who's flexible!,196
2186,Zapp,"Your attention, please. As captain of this vessel, the terrible burden of naming a limbo contest winner is mine and mine alone.",196
2187,Kif,Shouldn't you be steering between the comets?,196
2188,Zapp,"And the winner is, Leela!",196
2189,Leela,But I didn't even limbo.,196
2190,Zapp,"No matter. I know from personal experience how horizontal you can get. As your reward, you and that hairpile are invited to dine at the captain's table this evening.",196
2191,Bender,"Well, now you know. I'm not actually rich. I'm a fraud. A poor, lazy, sexy fraud. This isn't even a real bow-tie, it's magnetic.",196
2192,Countess,"Bender, I don't care whether you have money. I love you for your artificial intelligence and your sincerity simulator.",196
2193,Bender,You do? Really?,196
2194,[Montage,In some scenes lifted from,196
2195,Zapp,"I like your style, Fry. You remind me of a young me. Not much younger, mind you. Perhaps even a couple of years older.",197
2196,Fry,"Thank you, sir.",197
2197,Zapp,"As a gentleman, I must warn you. If you so much as glance at another woman, I'll be all over Leela like a fly on a pile of very seductive manure.",197
2198,Fry,"Well, rest assured, Leela's the only girl for me.",197
2199,Amy,"Hey, Fry.",197
2200,Leela,Amy!,197
2201,Amy,Leela!,197
2202,Zapp,"Ah, the family Wong. Our party is complete.",197
2203,Leela,What are we gonna do? Fry can't pretend to be both our boyfriends.,197
2204,Fry,Sure I can. I learned how to handle delicate social situations from a little show called Three's Company.,197
2205,Zapp,I'd like to impose a toast on the happy couple. Down the hatch!,197
2206,Mrs. Wong,"Hear, hear! Now let's have a kiss!",197
2207,Zapp,"Yes, Fry. Plant one on your woman.",197
2208,Fry,"Um, let me think. Come and knock on our door, nuh, nuh, nuh, nuh, nuh, nuh. Uh, Mr. Roper--",197
2209,Mr. Wong,What's the hold up? Kiss my daughter already!,197
2210,Farnsworth,"Wait, I'm confused. Now tell me, Fry, which one of these ladies are you involved with?",197
2211,Fry,Uh...,197
2212,Kif,"Captain, may I have a word with you?",197
2213,Zapp,No.,197
2214,Kif,"It's an emergency, sir.",197
2215,Zapp,"Come back when it's a catastrophe.  Oh, very well.",197
2216,Amy,"Well, with Zapp gone and my parents still here, I suggest Fry give me a nice, convincing kiss.",197
2217,Fry,"Ah, now there's something we can all enjoy.",197
2218,Kif,"Sir, remember your course correction?",198
2219,Zapp,No.,198
2220,Kif,Well it's proving somewhat more suicidal than we'd initially hoped.,198
2221,Zapp,"Kif, old friend, I don't know which disgusts me more",198
2222,Fry,"Hey, Leela, why'd you run off from dinner?",199
2223,Leela,I didn't run off. I had plenty of time to finish eating and stroll away while you were kissing Amy.,199
2224,Fry,"Oh, look, I'm not actually interested in her if that's what's bothering you.",199
2225,Leela,"Oh, are you sure? I mean, she has two eyes, you have two eyes.",199
2226,Fry,"I know, we seem like a perfect match, but I just don't feel that way about her.",199
2227,Leela,Nice nebula.,199
2228,Fry,Yeah.,199
2229,Leela,Look's like everybody's got somebody. Except me.,199
2230,Fry,And me.,199
2231,Leela,"What was that?  Oh, my God! We're heading straight into a black hole.",199
2232,Fry,Talk about a mood killer!,199
2233,Zapp,"Don't blame yourself, Kif. We were doomed from the start. Nothing remains now but for the captain to go down with his ship.",200
2234,Kif,"Why, that's surprisingly noble of you, sir.",200
2235,Zapp,"No, it's noble of you, Kif!  ... you're in command. Congratulations, captain!",200
2236,Leela,OK. We just have to get from here to the escape pods.,201
2237,Farnsworth,I'm too young to die!,201
2238,Leela,"Come on, before it's too late!",201
2239,Bender,"You all go without me. I'm gonna take one last look around. You know, for, uh, stuff to steal.",201
2240,Fry,"You're going back or the Countess, aren't you?",201
2241,Bender,"Alright, I am. But I don't want the others to know. If I don't come back, just say I died robbing some old man.",201
2242,Fry,"I'll tell them you went out prying the wedding ring off his cold, dead finger.",201
2243,Bender,"I love you, buddy!",201
2244,Bender,Countess? Countess?,201
2245,Countess,Bender!,201
2246,Countess,I fell through the deck.,201
2247,Bender,"Are you hurt, my sweet?",201
2248,Countess,No. Luckily a family broke my fall.,201
2249,Bender,Just hang on! I'll take care of that fire!,201
2250,Countess,"Bender, you risked your life to save me.",201
2251,Bender,"And I'd do it again. And perhaps a third time. But that would be it.  When we kiss, I feel like I'm standing waist-deep in a pool of cold, rising water.",201
2252,Leela,Hurry! The escape pods should be just ahead!,202
2253,Hermes,Faster!,202
2254,Leela,It won't move. And the door release is on the other side.,202
2255,Fry,Then we're dead meat. No one could squeeze under there!,202
2256,Hermes,"No one, except a legendary limbo champion.",202
2257,LaBarbara,"Oh, Hermes!",202
2258,Hermes,Ooh! It's been a while.  This one is for that little kid who's limbo-ing up in heaven right now.,202
2259,LaBarbara,"That's my man, alright, baby, limbo!",202
2260,Hermes,"I still got the moves! Zoidberg, lower the door another inch.",202
2261,LaBarbara,"Just go on through and hit the release, you hot dog!",202
2262,Hermes,"Yes, dear.",202
2263,LaBarbara,That's my man!,202
2264,Amy,"Yay, Hermes!",202
2265,Hermes,"Uh, can somebody help me up?",202
2266,Countess,"Well, now what are we going to do?",203
2267,Bender,Wait a second. Aren't you a member of the yacht club?,203
2268,Countess,"By God, you're right! I'm a class-3 yacht.",203
2269,Farnsworth,Thank God there are plenty of escape pods. We won't have to dress up like women and children.,204
2270,Leela,We can't leave yet. We've got to wait for Bender. The high gravity must be slowing down his looting.,204
2271,Mrs. Wong,Amy!,204
2272,Amy,Mom? Dad? You're alive!,204
2273,Mr. Wong,"Yeah, but so what? The important thing is we found you a new man.",204
2274,Mrs. Wong,A captain.,204
2275,Amy,"Uh, Mom, I don't--  Hi!",204
2276,Kif,Hello!,204
2277,Farnsworth,I don't feel well!,204
2278,Fry,Look! It's our nebula. Whenever I see it I'll think back to that moment when we almost--  Never mind!,204
2279,Hermes,Everyone else is off the ship. Where in Babylon is Bender?,204
2280,Leela,I don't know. But we can't wait any longer.,204
2281,Fry,"Goodbye, Bender.",204
2282,Bender,Wait for us!,204
2283,Leela,Something's wrong. We're two metric tons overweight.,204
2284,Amy,"Well, it's not me!",204
2285,Fry,Look!,204
2286,Countess,"I'm slipping, Bender. The pull is too strong!",204
2287,Bender,"I can't live without you. If you let go, I let go!",204
2288,Countess,"No! You have too much to live for. It may hurt for a while but one day you'll share your love again. After all, it's shareware.",204
2289,Bender,Don't talk like that. Tragic romances always have a happy ending.,204
2290,Countess,Farewell!,204
2291,Bender,No!,204
2292,Bender,She's gone.,204
2293,Leela,"But she saved all our lives. Without her, we're light enough to get away.",204
2294,Fry,"Don't cry, Bender. Nobody really knows what happens in a black hole. It's possible she's still alive in another dimension somewhere. Right, Professor?",204
2295,Farnsworth,"Oh, yes, absolutely!  Not a chance!",204
2296,Bender,At least I'll always have her bracelet!  What do you think it's worth?,204
2297,Hermes,"It's fake, mon!",204
2298,Farnsworth,"Good news, everyone.  We've got a very special delivery today.",205
2299,Fry,Who's it going to?,205
2300,Farnsworth,Me.,205
2301,Bender,Another job well done.,205
2302,Farnsworth,"No, I need it shipped to my office at Mars University.  It's a little experiment that may well win me the Nobel Prize.",205
2303,Leela,In what field?,205
2304,Farnsworth,"I don't care, they all pay the same.",205
2305,Fry,Is it dangerous?,205
2306,Farnsworth,"Oh, my, no.  Off we go!",205
2307,Fry,Very impressive. Back in the 20th century we had no idea there was a university on Mars.,207
2308,Farnsworth,"Well, in those days Mars was just a dreary, uninhabitable wasteland, uh, much like Utah. But unlike Utah, it was eventually made livable, when the university was founded in 2636.",207
2309,Leela,"They planted traditional college foliage; ivy, trees, hemp. Soon the whole planet was terraformed.",207
2310,Fry,Does that mean it's safe to breathe the air?,207
2311,Farnsworth,Of course.,207
2312,Farnsworth,Over here is Wong Library. It has the largest collection of literature in the Western Universe.,208
2313,Bender,"Hey, look! There's a chapter of my old robot fraternity, Epsilon Rho Rho.",208
2314,Leela,You went to college?,208
2315,Bender,"Of course. I'm a bender, I went to Bending College. I majored in Bending.",208
2316,Fry,What was your minor?,208
2317,Bender,Robo-American Studies.,208
2318,Fratbot #1,Are you here to fumigate the moose head?,209
2319,Bender,"Uh, no, actually I'm an Epsilon from way back.",209
2320,Fratbot #1,"Eh, close enough. C'mon in.",209
2321,Bender,Thanks. Here's your finger back.,209
2322,Bender,All the coolest robots are in this fraternity.,209
2323,Fratbot #2,Mate in 143 moves.,209
2324,Fratbot #3,"Oh, pooh. You win again!",209
2325,Bender,"Uh-oh, nerds!",209
2326,Fratbot #1,"Allow me to introduce myself. I'm Gearshift, chapter president. This is Oily, and this here is Fat-bot.",209
2327,Bender,You're all losers. My name's Bender.,209
2328,Oily,"Bender from Bending State Bender? Wow, you're a legend around here!",209
2329,Fat-bot,"I heard that in one single night you drank a whole keg, streaked across campus and crammed 58 humans into a phone booth.",209
2330,Bender,"Yeah, well, a lot of 'em were children. Anyway I should get going.",209
2331,Gearshift,"No, Bender, wait. We're the lamest frat on campus. Even Hillel has better parties than us. Please, you've gotta stay and teach us how to be cool.",209
2332,Bender,"Hmm, OK. But I'll need 10 kegs of beer, a continuous tape of Louie Louie and a regulation two-storey panty-raid ladder.",209
2333,Fat-bot,"Oh, boy! Oh, boy! Oh, boy!",209
2334,Fry,"I tell you, being here really takes me back to my college days.",210
2335,Man #1,Step right up. Who wants to learn physics?,210
2336,Man #2,Keep your hands inside the car at all times.,210
2337,Fry,"Good old Coney Island College! Go, Whitefish!",210
2338,Leela,"Don't take this the wrong way, Fry, but you don't seem like the educated type.",210
2339,Fry,"Oh, yeah?  Read it and weep. I'm a certified college dropout.",210
2340,Leela,Please! Everyone knows 20th century colleges were basically expensive daycare centres.,210
2341,Farnsworth,"That's true. By current academic standards, you're merely a high school dropout.",210
2342,Fry,"What? That's not fair. I deserve the same respect any other college dropout gets. By God, I'm gonna enroll here at Mars University and drop out all over again!",210
2343,Leela,You won't last two weeks.,210
2344,Fry,"Aww, thanks for believing in me.",210
2345,Amy,"Yo, classmate. What you takin'?",211
2346,Fry,"Oh, I don't know.  Hey, Professor, what are you teaching this semester?",211
2347,Farnsworth,Same thing I teach every semester,211
2348,Fry,I'll be there!,211
2349,Farnsworth,"Please, Fry, I don't know how to teach; I'm a professor!",211
2350,Fry,See you in class!,211
2351,Farnsworth,Oh!,211
2352,Fat-bot,This is gonna be great!,212
2353,Bender,Bingo!,212
2354,Fat-bot,"Oh, mama!",212
2355,Bender,Get a load of that!,212
2356,Meiderneyer,"I say, you've damaged our servants' quarters ... and our servants.",212
2357,Chet,This time Robot House has gone too far.,212
2358,Bender,Cheese it!,212
2359,Fat-bot,They're gonna catch us!,212
2360,Fry,"Hey, pretty nice for a single. Two desks, two chairs, a couple of beds.  A woodpecker.",213
2361,Leela,I think that's probably your roommate.,213
2362,Fry,"Oh, right, cool.  What the--?",213
2363,Monkey,I call top bunk!,213
2364,Fry,My roommate's a monkey?,213
2365,Monkey,"Brilliant deduction, you're a credit to your species.",213
2366,Farnsworth,"Ah, Fry, I see you've met Guenter!",213
2367,Fry,You know each other?,213
2368,Farnsworth,Guenter is my experiment. He was the top secret contents of this stinking crate.,213
2369,Guenter,I'd rather live in a crate than share a room with this dork.,213
2370,Leela,So what makes Guenter talk?,213
2371,Fry,Is he genetically engineered?,213
2372,Farnsworth,"Oh, please! That's preposterous science-fiction mumbo-jumbo. Guenter's intelligence actually lies in his electronium hat which harnesses the power of sunspots to produce cognitive radiation.",213
2373,Guenter,"You're wasting your breath, Professor. He'll never understand a word of it.",213
2374,Fry,"I understood the word ""hat""!",213
2375,Farnsworth,"Please, stop bickering. I arranged that you be roommates for a reason",213
2376,Fry,You want a banana?,213
2377,Guenter,I don't eat bananas. I prefer banana-flavoured energy bars made from tofu.,213
2378,Fry,I don't like you.,213
2379,Fry,This is gonna be a cakewalk!,214
2380,Teacher,"Welcome to the history of the 20th century. Look to your left, then to your right. Then in nine other directions. One of the 12 of you will not pass this class.",214
2381,Amy,Boring.  Let's hear about Walter Mondale already!,214
2382,Teacher,Be forewarned,214
2383,Fry,Swish!,214
2384,Teacher,"You were saying, Mr. Fry?",214
2385,Fry,"I'm from the 20th century. Go ahead, ask me anything.",214
2386,Teacher,Very well. What device invented in the 20th century allowed people to view broadcast programmes in their own homes?,214
2387,Fry,Ooh ... I know this ... whatyya call it? Lite Brite!,214
2388,Guenter,I believe the answer is the television.,214
2389,Teacher,"Very good, Mr. ...  ... Guenter.",214
2390,Amy,Wow! Smart and cute!,214
2391,Vernon,What I love about being dean of students is the peace and quiet and the respect I receive.  Now what's all this about?,215
2392,Woman,"Dean Vernon, the students from Robot House are here.",215
2393,Vernon,Robot House!,215
2394,Bender,"Hey, dean, nice looking model.",215
2395,Vernon,"You keep away from it. You robots are a disgrace to this university. Whenever a fire alarm is pulled, it's Robot House. Whenever the campus liquor store is looted, Robot House. Whenever a human corpse is desecrated--",215
2396,Bender,"Now, I can explain that.",215
2397,Vernon,"That's enough out of you. From this day forth, Robot House is on dodecatupple-secret probation!",215
2398,Bender,No fair!,215
2399,Fat-bot,My mom is gonna kill me!,215
2400,Vernon,"Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to get back to the one thing that's kept me sane these past eight years",215
2401,Gearshift,Fat-bot! No!,215
2402,Fat-bot,When I get nervous I get hungry.,215
2403,Bender,Cheese it!,215
2404,Vernon,Robot House!,215
2405,Fry,"So, Chrissy, we seem to be hitting it off. If you're not doing anything later might I escort you to a kegger?",216
2406,Chrissy,Not even if you were the last man on Mars.,216
2407,Guenter,Hey! You like bananas?,216
2408,Guenter,I got her number. How do you like them bananas?,216
2409,Farnsworth,"And therefore, by process of elimination, the electron must taste like grapeade.",217
2410,Fry,"Sorry, I overslept.",217
2411,Farnsworth,Until 5pm?,217
2412,Fry,It's that obnoxious monkey. He kept me up all night with his constant thinking. Just thinking and thinking. He's trying to make me look like an idiot.,217
2413,Farnsworth,"Don't be jealous. Without his special hat, Guenter might be no more intelligent than you.",217
2414,Fry,I hate that rodent!,217
2415,Farnsworth,"Fry, that monkey is my most important experiment. If you two don't stop fighting I'll have you both neutered.",217
2416,Fry,That'll show him.,217
2417,Amy,"Dean Vernon, I'd like you to meet my parents, Leo and Inez.",218
2418,Vernon,"Ah, Mr. and Mrs. Wong, I'm so glad we could admit Amy in exchange for your generous contribution.",218
2419,Mr. Wong,How much more for Phi Beta Kappa?,218
2420,Vernon,How much you got?,218
2421,Guenter,"Sorry I'm late, I was off at a study session ... with Chrissy!",218
2422,Farnsworth,"Oh, I'm glad you made it, Guenter because in honour of parents weekend I have a special surprise for you.",218
2423,Guenter,This is so humiliating.,218
2424,Fry,Now these monkeys I like!  What's that? You wanna come out?,218
2425,Guenter,No! Stop!,218
2426,Chet,I say.,218
2427,Farnsworth,What's that they're flinging at us?,218
2428,Guenter,"Oh, dear Lord! All over the dean!",218
2429,Fry,"Hey, uh, Guenter? Why don't you get up on the chandelier with your parents and I'll take a picture?",218
2430,Bender,"Well, looks like the party's winding down. Let's take a road trip to Tijuana and get Fat-bot some action.",218
2431,Fat-bot,"It's my first time, I'm really nervous.",218
2432,Vernon,Robot House!,218
2433,Leela,"What you did to Guenter was cruel. At the risk of sounding like an after-school special, I think we learned who the real animal was today.",219
2434,Fry,You mean peer pressure?,219
2435,Fry,Look out! He's got a gun!,219
2436,Guenter,Leave me alone.,219
2437,Leela,"Hey, what's going on? I thought you didn't like bananas.",219
2438,Guenter,Of course I do. I try so hard to fit in but seeing my parents act like that made me realise I'm just a primitive beast.,219
2439,Fry,"Hey, hey, cheer up. Not everyone turns out like their parents. I mean, look at me. My folks were honest, hard-working people.",219
2440,Leela,"Besides, Guenter, you're not like other monkeys. You've got the hat.",219
2441,Guenter,"So what? I mean, sure, it looks cool and it makes me smart but it doesn't make me happy.",219
2442,Leela,That's so sad. I didn't even know monkeys could cry.,219
2443,Guenter,They can't. It's all the hat.,219
2444,Fry,"Look, Guenter, if you're so miserable here, maybe you should just go back to the jungle.",219
2445,Guenter,"The jungle. But I couldn't do that to the Professor. I'm his prize experiment, and he's like a father to me.",219
2446,Leela,But he's not your father. That guy in the punch bowl was your father.,219
2447,Farnsworth,Look at him. I'm so proud.,220
2448,Fry,"Thanks, Professor!",220
2449,Farnsworth,Not you.,220
2450,Fry,Ow!,220
2451,Student,Hey!,220
2452,Farnsworth,"Oh, I always feared he might run off like this. Why? Why? Why didn't I break his legs?",220
2453,Farnsworth,"Oh, poor Guenter.",221
2454,Leela,So he just ran away in the middle of the exam?,221
2455,Farnsworth,I'm afraid so. All he handed in was a paper smeared with faeces. He tied with Fry.,221
2456,Fry,I guess he realised I was right when I told him to go back to the jungle.,221
2457,Farnsworth,You what? After I spent months slaving over a hot monkey brain?,221
2458,Fry,"Hey, don't blame me. You tried to force Guenter to be a human but he's an animal. He belongs in the wild. Or in the circus on one of those tiny tricycles. Now that's entertainment!",221
2459,Farnsworth,"But Guenter's obviously better off being intelligent. Tell him, Leela.",221
2460,Leela,"Nuh-uh, I'm staying out of this. Now here's my opinion",221
2461,Farnsworth,What?,221
2462,Leela,I said we'll go to the jungle and let Guenter decide once and for all.,221
2463,Farnsworth,What?,221
2464,Vernon,"You all know the rules. Whichever house wins the regatta becomes head of the Greek Council. And should that house currently be on any type of multiple secret probation, it will be lifted and I will be forced to serve as Grand Marshal of a parade honouring them.",222
2465,Chet,"I say, Robot House, your water craft is as ill-designed as you yourselves.",222
2466,Meiderneyer,"Good one, Chet!",222
2467,Bender,"Oh, yeah? Watch this!",222
2468,Chet,"Well, I never!",222
2469,Vernon,"Fraternities, on your marks.",222
2470,Bender,Hey!,222
2471,Fry,Wow! The jungles on Mars look just like the jungles on Earth.,223
2472,Farnsworth,Jungles? On Earth?,223
2473,Leela,I see some movement up there. I think it's him.,223
2474,Farnsworth,Stand back.,223
2475,Leela,Oops.,223
2476,Farnsworth,Don't worry. They'll be fine once the tranquiliser wears off.,223
2477,Fry,There's our man!,223
2478,Leela,"Professor, you'll offer Guenter the hat and, Fry, you'll offer him the banana.  We'll let him choose whether he wants to be intelligent or just a mindless animal.",223
2479,Farnsworth,"Come on, Guenter, take the hat.",223
2480,Fry,"No, the banana, the banana!",223
2481,Farnsworth,Consider the philosophical and metaphysical ramifications of the--,223
2482,Fry,"Banana, banana, banana!",223
2483,Leela,"Wait, what's that sound?",223
2484,Gearshift,"Hey, Bender, you sure this is a short-cut?",223
2485,Bender,Not as sure as I was an hour ago!,223
2486,Vernon,And the winner is ...  ... Robot House?,223
2487,Farnsworth,"Oh, dear Lord!",223
2488,Leela,No! No!,223
2489,Farnsworth,Thank God this log is sturdy.  Stupid monkey.,223
2490,Fry,No.,223
2491,Leela,Not there.,223
2492,Farnsworth,Keep trying.,223
2493,Guenter,Eureka! The hat goes on the head. It's all so obvious now!,223
2494,Leela,"Help us, Guenter!",223
2495,Guenter,"Oh, my goodness.  Grab on!",223
2496,Farnsworth,We're saved!,223
2497,Fry,"'Preciate it, Guenter!",223
2498,Leela,"Oh, no! Hurry, Guenter, climb up the vine. You can still save yourself.",223
2499,Guenter,"Why bother? I've got nothing to live for. I was miserable as a genius, and as a monkey, I was so dumb I tried to wear a hat on my butt.  Although, on the other hand--",223
2500,Farnsworth,"Oh, that poor, sweet monkey. Well, let's go gather him up. There's no sense letting him go to waste.",223
2501,Fry,Guenter! You're alive!,223
2502,Guenter,I guess the hat must have broke my fall.,223
2503,Farnsworth,"It seems to be working at only half-capacity, but I can fix it.",223
2504,Guenter,"No, wait! I like it like this. I actually feel sort of happy.",223
2505,Farnsworth,But what about your super-intelligence?,223
2506,Guenter,When I had that there was too much pressure to use it. All I want out of life is to be a monkey of moderate intelligence who wears a suit. That's why I've decided to transfer to business school!,223
2507,Farnsworth,Nooo!,223
2508,Bender,"Come on, everyone! Big party in Robot House!",224
2509,Fry,"Pizza delivery! Wow, so this is a real TV station, huh?",225
2510,Technician,"Well, it's a Fox affiliate.",225
2511,Fry,What are you showing right now?,225
2512,Technician,Single Female Lawyer. It's the season finale. Wanna watch?,225
2513,Fry,"Ah, I dunno. That's a chick show. I prefer programmes of the genre ""world's blankiest blank"".",225
2514,Technician,She is wearing the world's shortiest skirt.,225
2515,Fry,I'm in!,225
2516,Judge,"Counselor, I remind you that it's unethical to sleep with your client. If you really care about the outcome of the case, you should sleep with me.",225
2517,Single Female Lawyer,"Your Honour, it's bad enough to proposition a single female lawyer in court, but this is a unisex bathroom.",225
2518,Judge,"Overruled, counselor!",225
2519,Stenographer,Could you repeat that last part?,225
2520,Technician,"Oh, my God! You've knocked Fox of the air!",225
2521,Fry,Pft! Like anyone on Earth cares.,225
2522,[Scene,In a pullback sequence lifted from,226
2523,[Cut to,"Omicronian Living Room. Two huge green aliens, Lrrr and Nd-Nd, watch",226
2524,Stenographer,Could you repeat that last par--,226
2525,Lrrr,This is an outrage! I demand to know what happened to the plucky lawyer and her compellingly short garment.,226
2526,Announcer,"Due to technical difficulties, we now bring you eight animated shows in a row.",226
2527,Hermes,"What in the name of Bob Marley's ghost? Get to work, you lazy boat bag!",227
2528,Bender,Ow!,227
2529,Fry,"Ow! Hey, quit it, Hermes. It's Labor Day.",227
2530,Hermes,Labor Day? That phoney-baloney holiday crammed down our throats by fat-cat union gangsters?,227
2531,Fry,That's the one.,227
2532,Hermes,"Hot damn, a day off!",227
2533,Leela,Who's up for one last summer beach trip?,227
2534,Bender,"Aw, yeah!",227
2535,Hermes,"Ready, Freddy!",227
2536,Fry,"Eh, I think I'll just stay here.",227
2537,Leela,"Fry, you're wasting your life sitting in front of that TV. You need to get out and see the real world.",227
2538,Fry,But this is HDTV. It's got better resolution than the real world!,227
2539,Leela,Everyone's too polite to say anything but you're covered with bed sores.,227
2540,Fry,Not covered!,227
2541,Leela,Just get in the car.,227
2542,Farnsworth,"Ah, here we are",229
2543,Fry,"Wait, Mount Rushmore and the Leaning Tower of Pisa? I didn't know they were both in New York!",229
2544,Leela,"They are now. In the 2600's, New Yorkers elected a super-villain governor, and he stole most of the world's monuments.",229
2545,Bender,Truly a great man. Look at him up there.,229
2546,Hermes,Aha!  Found you!,230
2547,Bender,"OK, now you go hide.  Nice knowin' you.",230
2548,Farnsworth,"Come on, Zoidberg, I passed it right to you.",230
2549,Zoidberg,I've had it with this game! I'm going for a scuttle!,230
2550,Bender,"OK, everyone, come and get it!",230
2551,Fry,"Ah, just like my dad used to make ... until McDonald's fired him.",230
2552,Bender,"Bite my red-hot glowing ass.  Aw, yeah!",230
2553,Amy,"No, Nibbler!  Psst, Professor, I need another bikini.",230
2554,Farnsworth,"Eh ... wha?  Oh, my.",230
2555,Amy,There. How do I look?,230
2556,Farnsworth,Like a cheap French harlot.,230
2557,Amy,French?,230
2558,Bully,"Say, doll-face, how'd you like to make time with a real man?",230
2559,Leela,No. I'm not attracted to bullies. No matter how big and ...  ... handsome they are.,230
2560,Fry,"It's OK, Leela, go ahead. I got a lot of work to do.",230
2561,Bully,"Uh, sir, you don't understand. I'm a professional beach bully. I pretend to steal your girl, you punch me, I go down, she swoons, you slip me 50 bucks.",230
2562,Fry,50 bucks? Not even if she was my girlfriend. You take her.,230
2563,Leela,Fry! Although I suppose we could go for a walk along the beach.,230
2564,Bully,"Uh, no thanks, ma'am, I'm actually gay.",230
2565,Zoidberg,"Uh-oh.  Bender, you gotta spring me. I'll never survive in here; I'm too pretty!",231
2566,Bender,"Alright, alright, I'll bust you out.  Cheese it!",231
2567,Fry,"Voila. The greatest sandcastle ever built. This is the kind of castle King Arthur would have lived in, if he were a fiddler crab.",232
2568,Leela,It's very nice. We should get a picture before the tide comes in.,232
2569,Fry,"Ooh, yeah. Anyone have a camera?",232
2570,Bender,"Right here, buddy.  Pretend you're happy.",232
2571,Zoidberg,Yay!,232
2572,Leela,"Oh, my God!",232
2573,Hermes,What in Babylon?,232
2574,Fry,Nooo!,232
2575,Hermes,Faster!,234
2576,Fry,"We're all gonna die, aren't we?",234
2577,Farnsworth,"Oh, I should think so. Although last time aliens invaded all they did was force the most intelligent of us to pair off and mate continuously.  Oh, yes!",234
2578,Linda,"Once again, today's winning lotto number was 4. In other news, alien saucers continue to rain destruction upon Earth. We now go live to an emergency address by Earth President McNeal.",234
2579,McNeal,"Ladies and gentlemen, our course is clear. The time has come to knuckle under. To get down on all fours and really lick boot. Give our alien masters whatever they want a--",234
2580,Lrrr,Now then,234
2581,McNeal,"And now, the man who will lead us in our proud struggle for freedom, fresh from his bloody triumph over the pacifists of the Gandhi Nebula, 25-star General Zapp Brannigan!",234
2582,Man,Yeah!,234
2583,Bender,"Hey, look, Leela, it's that idiotic windbag you slept with.",234
2584,Leela,The Earth is under attack. Can't we just forget about that?,234
2585,Bender,Evidently not.,234
2586,Zapp,That's why I'm ordering every available ship to report for duty. Anyone without a ship should secure a weapon and fire wildly into the air.,234
2587,Leela,"Well, you heard the windbag",234
2588,Bender,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on. I refuse to fight. I'm a conscientious objector.",234
2589,Fry,A what?,234
2590,Bender,"You know, a coward.",234
2591,Zapp,"Since this is an emergency, all robots will now have their patriotism circuits activated.",234
2592,Bender,"It is every robot's duty to give his life for the good of humanity.  Oh, crap!",234
2593,Zapp,"We're all from different cultures here. Some of you are white, some of you are black.  Am I right, soldier?",236
2594,Bender,"Well, actually, I--  Sir, yes, sir! Sir!",236
2595,Zapp,"Remember, our mission is simple",236
2596,Kif,"Um, uh, not me, sir.",236
2597,Zapp,"Oh, yes, right. Nobody destroy Kif.  This is turning into one very sex-ay struggle for the future of the human race!",236
2598,Leela,"Thanks, but I'm not technically human.",236
2599,Zapp,"Right, right. Nobody destroy Leela either.",236
2600,Zapp,"The key to victory is discipline, and that means a well-made bed. You will practise until you can make your bed in your sleep.",237
2601,Fry,You mean while I'm sleeping in it?,237
2602,Zapp,"You won't have time for sleeping, soldier. Not with all the bed-making you'll be doing.",237
2603,[Scene,Nimbus Briefing Room. The recruits are dressed in DOOP uniforms and Zapp briefs them à la the briefing in,238
2604,Zapp,"The alien mothership is in orbit here. If we can hit that bullseye, the rest of the dominoes will fall like a house of cards. Checkmate.  Now, like all great plans, my strategy is so simple an idiot could have devised it. On my command, all ships will line up and file directly into the alien death cannons, clogging them with wreckage.",238

2606,Bender,"Sir, I volunteer for a suicide mission.  Aw, cut it out!",238
2607,Zapp,"You're a brave robot, son. But when I'm in command every mission's a suicide mission. Which reminds me.  Leela, perhaps before we head into battle you'd like to make love to me, in case one of us doesn't come back.",238
2608,Leela,"Maybe we should wait till afterwards, in case neither of us comes back.",238

2641,Zapp,Really?,246
2642,Fry,Miniskirts? That sounds familiar.,246
2643,Lrrr,Surely you know McNeal. She is an unmarried human female struggling to succeed in a human male's world.,246
2644,Zapp,Maybe that's just her excuse for being incompetent.,246
2645,Lrrr,This is the McNeal.,246
2646,Fry,"Wait, I know her.",246
2647,Leela,"You do not, you big fat liar. You don't know anyone. All you do is watch TV.",246
2648,Fry,"That's where I know her from. She's Jenny McNeal. She was a character on a TV show back in the 20th century, Single Female Lawyer.",246

2656,Amy,Check this out,247
2657,Fry,Beer-- I would think.,247

2695,Leela,"Why not? It's clever, it's unexpected.",251
2696,Fry,"But that's not why people watch TV. Clever things make people feel stupid, and unexpected things make them feel scared.",251
2697,Lrrr,,251
2698,Fry,You see? TV audiences don't want anything original. They wanna see the same thing they've seen a thousand times before.,251
2699,Bender,"Whatchoo talkin' 'bout, Fry?",251
2700,Fry,"Trust me on this. While other people were out living their lives, I wasted mine watching TV, because deep down I knew it might one day help me save the world. Plus, I would have lost my Workman's Comp if I had gone outside. Now just read these cue cards.",251

2982,Bender,"Fine, we'll have rack of Nibbler.",270
2983,Leela,"Just make a simple cake. And this time, if someone's going to jump out of it, make sure you put them in after you cook it.",270
2984,Bender,"So it's a cake you want, is it? I'll make you a cake you'll never forget.",270
2985,Bender,"That'll take care of those annoying rats.  Now, to bake a cake so delicious they'll have no choice but to love and worship me.",271
2986,Bender,There! This'll teach those filthy bastards who's lovable. Now all I have to do is spell check it and it's ready for my admiring public.  That's it.,271

2989,Bender,Hey! Can't you see I'm using the toilet?,272
2990,Amy,Bender! How could you flush Nibbler down the toilet?,273
2991,Bender,"Well, step one, I had to lift the seat. That was the first little annoyance. Am I right, men?",273
2992,Leela,Aren't you upset at all? How would you feel if I flushed Fry down the toilet?,273
2993,Bender,Only one way to find out.,273
2994,Leela,You have no sympathy for anyone else's feelings.,273
2995,Bender,Of course I do. Right now I feel sorry for you.,273

3064,Leela,There's no such thing as mutants. That's a ridiculous urban myth.,281

3260,Fry,"You don't have to get so mad, Leela.",292
3261,Bender,"Yeah, Fry already wiped off some of the dirt with his finger.",292
3262,Leela,Zapp?,292
3263,Zapp,"Leela, I didn't know where else to turn. You're the only woman who ever loved me.",292
3264,Leela,I never loved you.,292
3265,Zapp,I mean physically.,292
3266,Leela,What do you want?,292
3267,Zapp,"Just let me work for a little food. Perhaps I could paint a fence, or service you sexually, or mop the floors.",292
3268,Leela,You don't know how to do any of those things.,292
3269,Zapp,Kif might.,292
3270,Farnsworth,"Leela, who are you talking to?",292
3271,Zapp,Just a broken-down hobo who's hit rock-bottom. And his commanding officer.,292
3272,Farnsworth,"Why, you're that disgraced starship captain.  Come in.",292
3273,Farnsworth,I'd like everyone to meet our new employees.  Which ones are new?,293
3274,Hermes,The green dude and the fat man.,293
3275,Farnsworth,"Hmm, I could swear I've never seen that robot before either.",293
3276,Bender,I'm Bender. You know? The lovable rascal.,293
3277,Farnsworth,"Oh, yes, yes. My good friend, of course.  Anyway, whoever you all are, I have good news. You'll be making a delivery to Stumbos 4, a planet with such high gravity you'll most likely be crushed under the weight of your own hair. Enjoy!",293
3278,Zapp,"So, this Leela. I know she's a very sensuous woman but what manner of captain is she?",294
3279,Fry,She's really strict.,294
3280,Bender,And mean.,294
3281,Zapp,I see. Does she by any chance give the crewmembers spankings?,294
3282,Fry,"No, she just makes us do work and stuff.",294
3283,Zapp,"Good, good. But should she ever institute some sort of bare-bottom spanking policy, let me go in your place. I won't have my comrades harmed.",294
3284,Bender,"Hey, this guy's alright!",294
3285,Zapp,"Here's to us poor schmoes working for the man. Even if he is a hot, sexy, female man.",294
3286,Kif,"I've computed out landing co-ordinates, Captain.",295
3287,Leela,"Thanks, Kif. Very nice work.",295
3288,Kif,"Wait, what?",295
3289,Leela,"I said ""very nice work"".",295
3290,Kif,This is the happiest day of my life.,295
3291,Leela,"OK, crew, listen up. Your job is to delivery these 40 pillows to that hotel.",296
3292,Bender,They're not very heavy but you don't hear me not complaining.,296
3293,Leela,They're not heavy in here because we have an anti-grav pump. But once you get out on the surface the gravity will be very intense.,296
3294,Fry,"Hey, no prob', this lead apron'll protect me.",296
3295,Leela,I don't want any screw-ups. Use the hover-dolly and just deliver one pillow at a time.,296
3296,Bender,"Hey, here's an idea, let's deliver all the pillows at once.",296
3297,Fry,Yeah!,296
3298,Zapp,That's using the old noodle!,296
3299,Zapp,"Come on, girdle. Hold!",297
3300,Bender,Uh-oh.,297
3301,Leela,What the hell happened?,297
3302,Bender,"Some breaking occurred, the dolly was involved, that's about all we know.",297
3303,Leela,I told you dumb apes not to overload it. Each of those pillows weighs 150lbs here.,297
3304,Fry,"Alright, don't get your panties in a knot. We'll just use the back-up dolly.",297
3305,Bender,I'll start loading up the pillows.,297
3306,Leela,"No way, Jack. You disobeyed an order, so now you have to deliver all 40 pillows by hand.",297
3307,Zapp,"Let me ask you a serious question, Leela",297
3308,Leela,Just get to work.,297
3309,Bender,"I'm Leela, get to work, neh, neh, neh.",297
3310,Fry,I agree.,297
3311,Kif,"The point is, it's just so humiliating working for that man. Once, he actually ordered me to ... shave his armpits while he was in the bathtub. So, I said--",298
3312,Leela,"Y'know, why don't we talk about something besides Zapp for a while?",298
3313,Kif,"Oh, alright. Um ... well ... how 'bout then, um... OK, well, there he was in the tub, alright?",298
3314,Fry,"Ah, some good old high-gravity rain. That'll cool us off.",299
3315,Bender,This is all Leela's fault.,299
3316,Fry,"Yeah. If she had let us use the back-up dolly, we could have broken it, given up and gone home by now.",299
3317,Zapp,"Y'know, boys, a good captain needs many skills, such as boldness, daring and a velour uniform. And I'm not convinced Leela has any of those things.",299
3318,Fry,"Ah, Leela's not that bad. I just wish she didn't make us work so much.",299
3319,Zapp,"Back when I was captain all I asked from my men was their complete loyalty. If I had that, then for all I cared they could sit around the whole day drinking beer in their underpants.",299
3320,Bender,Beer?,299
3321,Fry,Underpants?,299
3322,Kif,"But now, Zapp's not captain anymore. I'm free!  Oh, you hear that? I'm actually laughing!",300
3323,Fry,This is a mutiny.,300
3324,Bender,"You're outta here, lady. Zapp's the new captain.",300
3325,Fry,All hail the new captain.,300
3326,Zapp,"Leela, you might be a formidable do-er of the nasty but I am forced to relieve you of your post.",301
3327,Leela,"On what grounds, you slobbering oaf?",301
3328,Zapp,Failure to prevent a mutiny. Throw her in the brig.,301
3329,Fry,We don't have a brig.,301
3330,Zapp,"Then throw her in the laundry room, which will hereafter be referred to as ""the brig"".",301
3331,Leela,You really don't want me to be captain anymore?,302
3332,Bender,"You got it, genius.",302
3333,Leela,"But, didn't I do a good job?",302
3334,Fry,You were mean and you yelled and you made us do all that work.,302
3335,Leela,"Sometimes a captain needs to do those things. Besides I, I thought we were friends.",302
3336,Fry,"Yeah, well, you shouldn't have been such a mean captain then.",302
3337,Bender,"Don't worry, Leela. Soon we'll be able to look back on this and laugh.",302
3338,Zapp,"Back in my old uniform, and it nearly still fits. Even after all that fattening hobo cuisine.",302
3339,Kif,"What shall I do with your civilian clothes, sir?",302
3340,Zapp,"Take them to the laundry-brig.  So, do I have your loyalty, men?",302
3341,Bender,To the ends of the universe.,302
3342,Fry,Ten hundred percent!,302
3343,Zapp,That's not nearly loyal enough. I order you to sit around and drink beer until you're as loyal as Kif here.,302
3344,Bender,"Yes, sir, sir!",302
3345,Kif,"Um, may I have a beer, sir?",302
3346,Zapp,"No. You're loyal enough already. Meanwhile, I have a plan. We will single-handedly attack our archenemy the Neutral Planet.",302
3347,Kif,"Oh, jeez.",302
3348,Zapp,"Once the neutral war machine lies in ruins, I'll be a hero again and the DOOP will reinstate me as captain.",302
3349,Kif,"But, sir, that plan makes no sense.",302
3350,Zapp,"Maybe not to you, Kif, but if I recall correctly, you were court-martialled in disgrace.",302
3351,Fry,"Ooh, burn!",302
3352,Bender,"Nailed you, buddy!",302
3353,Zapp,Prepare to continue the epic struggle between good and neutral.,303
3354,Fry,"This is awesome! We're gonna be like pow-pow-pow, and they're gonna be like ...  ... and then we'll have pancakes to celebrate and I'll be like...",303
3355,Zapp,"Precisely. Now, in the name of all that is good and honourable, we'll call the Neutral President with a message of peace, then blast him.",303
3356,Bender,"Yes, sir, sirdy-sir-sir-sir!",303
3357,Zapp,Fly the white flag of war.,303
3358,Zapp,This is Zapp Brannigan of the good ship ... Planet Express Ship. I come swinging the olive branch of peace.,305
3359,Neutral President's Aide,"Should we trust him, Your Neutralness?",305
3360,Neutral President,All I know is my gut says maybe.,305
3361,Bender,"What now, chief?",305
3362,Zapp,"Now we crash the ship into their headquarters, killing them in a hellish firestorm from which no living thing can escape.",305
3363,Fry,"Good, good, then what?",305
3364,Zapp,"Then your mission is complete. I, meanwhile, will have ejected to safety, wearing the only spacesuit on board.",305
3365,Fry,Wait a second. Is this plan gonna kill us?,305
3366,Zapp,"Of course. What do you think I meant by ""loyalty""? Now help me into the only spacesuit. It looks a bit sweaty in there so you may need to apply baby powder.",305
3367,Fry,"Leela, we want you to be captain again.",306
3368,Leela,Let me guess. He cancelled naptime?  So he's about to kill us?,306
3369,Fry,We want Leela to be captain again.,307
3370,Zapp,"So it's mutiny, is it? I never thought I'd see the day. Come, Kif, let's eject. I found a children's spacesuit you can wear.",307
3371,Kif,"To be honest, sir, I'd rather stay here with Captain Leela. She actually listens to what I have to--",307
3372,Leela,"Oh, no! He's disabled the steering.  We're gonna crash!",307
3373,Bender,"Leela save me ... and yourself, I guess ... and my banjo.  And Fry.",307
3374,Leela,"OK, OK. We have one chance. Are you willing to do what I say as captain?",307
3375,Fry,Absolutely.,307
3376,Leela,Even if I make you work hard?,307
3377,Bender,As your God is my witness.,307
3378,Leela,Then go get the hover-dolly you didn't break and load all the dark matter into the left engine.,307
3379,Bender,"Oh, man, that crap's heavy.",307
3380,Fry,And warm.,307
3381,Leela,Just do it.,307
3382,Neutral President's Aide,"Your Neutralness, it's a beige alert.",308
3383,Neutral President,"If I don't survive, tell my wife, ""Hello"".",308
3384,Leela,Hurry! I don't wanna die at the age of 25.,309
3385,Bender,"Honey, unless we hit a time warp, I wouldn't worry about it.",309
3386,Fry,It's too low.,309
3387,Bender,Quick.,309
3388,Leela,You did it! You actually did it!,310
3389,Fry,And no one will have to punish anyone for the mutiny.,310
3390,Zapp,"And so, when Captain Leela panicked, perhaps distracted by female troubles, my quick thinking allowed me to do whatever I did to save the day.",311
3391,Glab,"Captain Leela, is this rambling story of magic and heroism true?",311
3392,Leela,"Well, actually--",311
3393,Farnsworth,That a girl! If they don't take him back we can keep him as captain.,311
3394,Leela,"Your Honour, it's all true",311
3395,Glab,"In that case, Zapp Brannigan, I hereby restore your rank and parking privileges.",311
3396,Farnsworth,"Oh, foo!",311
3397,Zapp,"Come, Kif, we've got work to do.",311
3398,Kif,I-I'll call and tell you about it.,311
3399,Fry,"Leela, I just want you to know that even though you're mean, you're the best captain ever.",312
3400,Bender,"Yeah, you're one dynamite lady. Can we have a week off?",312
3401,Leela,No.,312
3402,Fry,Please?,312
3403,Bender,"Come on, Captain.",312
3404,Leela,"Oh, alright.",312
3405,Farnsworth,No time off.,312
3406,Fry,"Aw, man.",312
3407,Leela,Let's mutiny!,312
3408,[Scene,Planet Express,313
3409,Narrator,"As per your request, please find enclosed the last man on earth.",313
3410,Man,"Hey, look at that weird mirror!",313
3411,Bender,Cursed by his own hubris!,313
3412,Leela,"There's a political debate on! Quick, change the channel!",313
3413,Bender,"Hey, that's what Fry said when we turned on the debate!",313
3414,Announcer,C-SPAN9 presents,313
3415,Leela,"Look, I know there are no car chases but this is important. One of these two men will become president of the world.",313
3416,Fry,What do we care? We live in the United States.,313
3417,Leela,The United States is part of the world.,313
3418,Fry,Wow! I have been gone a long time.,313
3419,Johnson,It's time someone had the courage to stand up and say,313
3420,Jackson,"Now I respect my opponent. I think he's a good man but, quite frankly, I agree with everything he just said!",313
3421,Fry,These are the candidates? They sound like clones.  Wait a minute. They are clones!,313
3422,Leela,Don't let their identical DNA fool you. They differ on some key issues.,313
3423,Johnson,I say your three cent titanium tax goes too far.,313
3424,Jackson,And I say your three cent titanium tax doesn't go too far enough!,313
3425,Fry,"If I were registered to vote, I'd send these clowns a message by staying home on election day and dressing up like a clown.",313
3426,Leela,You're not registered?,313
3427,Fry,"Nope. Not vaccinated either! Besides, it's not like one vote ever made a difference.",313
3428,Leela,That's not true; the first robot president won by exactly one vote.,313
3429,Bender,"Ah, yes, John Quincy Adding Machine. He struck a cord with the voters when he pledged not to go on a killing spree.",313
3430,Farnsworth,"But, like most politicians, he promised more than he could deliver.",313
3431,Leela,"The point is, one vote can make a difference and even though it won't, I'm still taking you to get registered.",313
3432,Farnsworth,"Yes, that's a capital idea. Let's all go register!",313
3433,Fry,"Professor, when did you become so obsessed with voting?",313
3434,Farnsworth,The very instant I became old.,313
3435,Farnsworth,The problem with both parties is that they always want to give your tax dollars to the less fortunate.,314
3436,Fry,The less fortunate get all the breaks!,314
3437,Zoidberg,"You know, Fry, you could join a third party, maybe.",314
3438,Amy,Only weirdos and mutants join third parties.,314
3439,Zoidberg,Really? I'd better keep an eye out at the next meeting.,314
3440,Fry,"What party do you belong to, Bender?",314
3441,Bender,I'm not allowed to vote.,314
3442,Fry,'Cause you're a robot?,314
3443,Bender,"No, convicted felon.",314
3444,Woman,We favour unreasonably huge subsidies to the Brain Slug Planet.,314
3445,Fry,"OK, but what are the Brain Slugs who control you gonna do for the working man?",314
3446,Woman,Attach Brain Slugs to them.,314
3447,Fry,"Sure, you say that now!",314
3448,Amy,"So, is it true you can make all kinds of shirts and ropes out of hemp?",314
3449,Stoned Guy,"Dave's not here, man.",314
3450,Amy,I also heard hemp makes great shampoo.,314
3451,Stoned Guy,It does? No way! I gotta check out this brochure!,314
3452,Farnsworth,So what are you doing to protect my constitutional right to bear doomsday devices?,314
3453,N.R.A. Man,"Well, first off, we're gonna get rid of that three-day waiting period for mad scientists.",314
3454,Farnsworth,"Damn straight! Today, the mad scientist can't get a doomsday device, tomorrow it's the mad grad student. Where will it end?",314
3455,N.R.A. Man,"Amen, brother. I don't go anywhere without my mutated anthrax ...  ... for duck hunting.",314
3456,Zoidberg,"Sure, humans are cute, but how else are we supposed to test cosmetics?",314
3457,Hermes,I concur.,314
3458,Fry,Now here's a party I can get excited about. Sign me up!,314
3459,V.A.P. Man,"Sorry, not with that attitude.",314
3460,Fry,"OK then, screw it.",314
3461,V.A.P. Man,"Welcome aboard, brother!",314
3462,Fry,Alright!,314
3463,V.A.P. Man,You're out.,314
3464,Fry,That was pretty cool. I think I'm actually starting to get interested in politics.,315
3465,Linda,"And so, with two weeks left in the campaign, the question on everyone's mind is who will be the next President of Earth? Jack Johnson or bitter rival John Jackson? Two terrific candidates, huh, Morbo?",315
3466,Morbo,All humans are vermin in the eyes of Morbo.,315
3467,Linda,"In other local news, disaster struck on Saturn's moon of Titan today, when a titanium mine collapsed, trapping 1,000 robot workers.",315
3468,Bender,What? Lord have mercy!,315
3469,Linda,"Sir, what rescue operations are planned?",315
3470,Mine Spokesman,The plan is basically to pave over the area and get on with our lives.,315
3471,Morbo,News of the mines closing sent titanium prices skyrocketing.,315
3472,Bender,Alright! I'm rich!,315
3473,Leela,What are you talking about?,315
3474,Bender,My body's 40% titanium!  I'm finally richer than those snooty ATM machines.,315
3475,Fry,Too bad you can't spend it.,315
3476,Bender,"Oh, can't I?",315
3477,Fry,No.,315
3478,Bender,"Watch me, poor man.",315
3479,Pawnbroker,Pleasure doing business with you.,316
3480,Bender,"Game's over, losers. I have all the money! Compare your lives to mine and then kill yourselves!  You just lost five dollars!",316
3481,Bender,"Hey, buddy. Little help?  Thank you!",316
3482,Bender,"Hello, peasants.",316
3483,Leela,Bender? What happened to you?,316
3484,Fry,"Yeah, you look different. Did you get a haircut?",316
3485,Bender,"No, I sold my body.",316
3486,Farnsworth,"Sold your body? Oh, Bender, I've been down that road. I know it's glamorous and the parties are great but you'll end up spending every dollar you make on jewellery and skintight pants.",316
3487,Fry,"This is crazy, Bender. How are you gonna live without a body?",316
3488,Bender,Pft! Bodies are for hookers and fat people! All I need is a wad of cash with a head wrapped around it.,316
3489,Fry,"Well, at least now you can pay off your loan shark.",316
3490,Bender,"Yeah, right. What's he gonna do, break my legs?",316
3491,Bender,"Ah, this is the life. Another martini, please.",317
3492,Bender,"Shaken, not stirred.  Aw, yeah!",317
3493,Bender,Put it all on black.,318
3494,Croupier,21 red.  I beg your pardon. 33 black.,318
3495,Bender,Yes! The rich get richer!,318
3496,Bender,"Strike! In your face, Leela!  Ow!",319
3497,Bender,Timber!,320
3498,Fry,"Hey, Bender, can I take a ride in your car?",320
3499,Bender,"Maybe if you clean up first. It looks like your neck stepped in something. Oh, I'm sorry, that's just your body!",320
3500,Fry,Hey! You look me in the shins and say that.,320
3501,Bender,I've had it up to here with this place. I'm off to the Head Museum to hang out with classy heads like me who appreciate the finer things,320
3502,Bender,"Now, which group of heads is good enough for me to hang out with? What do you think, Fry? Fry?",321
3503,Schiffer,"Hi, I'm Claudia Schiffer's head.",321
3504,Fry,I recognise you. Didn't you use to have a body of some sort?,321
3505,Schiffer,"Yeah, but it was holding me back. You know, I just did the cover of the Sports Illustrated Swimcap Issue.",321
3506,Fry,"Well, you're looking great.",321
3507,Schiffer,Thanks. I wouldn't mind losing a few pounds though.,321
3508,Fry,Couldn't hurt.,321
3509,Bender,"Ah, US presidents.  This place has class.",322
3510,Clinton,"Hey, sugar cookie. You know, legally, nothing I can do counts as sex anymore.",322
3511,Ford,"I apologise for his rudeness, ma'am. He gets this way around meaty-looking women.",322
3512,Fry,"Hey, I remember you. I was gonna vote for you one time. But voting isn't cool so I stayed home alone and got trashed on Listerine.",322
3513,Ford,"Frankly, I've never felt voting to be all that essential to the process.",322
3514,Nixon,"No kidding, Ford.",322
3515,Bender,"So then the hookerbot says, ""That's not my expansion slot"" and my friend says, ""That's not my gold-plated 25-pin connector!""",322
3516,Washington,"Oh, Bender. Thou robots really cracketh me up.",322
3517,Bender,"You know, I like it here. What's the rent on one of these jars?",322
3518,George H.W. Bush,"Sorry, Bender, but we just can't allow every Tom, Dick, and Harry to move in. No offence, Jefferson, Nixon and Truman.",322
3519,Carter,Maybe Mr. Bender can get a spot in the closet of presidential losers.,322
3520,Dole,"Bob Dole needs company. LaRouche won't stop with the ""knock knock"" jokes.",322
3521,Bender,Pass.,322
3522,Washington,"So, telleth, Bender. What hath happened to your body?",322
3523,Bender,I hocked it.,322
3524,Washington,Hocked it? Why wouldst thou do that?,322
3525,Bender,Same reason you hocked your teeth.,322
3526,Washington,Ah. Booze money.,322
3527,Nixon,"I remember my body; flabby, pastey-skinned, riddled with phlebitis. A good Republican body! God, I loved it.",322
3528,Fry,"I hear that. I spent most of my teen years loving my body. Course, it was tough love but-- Ooh!",322
3529,Leela,"Fry, he opened up relations with China. He doesn't want to hear about your ding-dong.",322
3530,Bender,"So, Nixon. Even if you miss your body, being a head's great too, right?",322
3531,Nixon,"No, son. It's a sad and lonely life.",322
3532,Bender,"Oh, great. Now you tell me!",322
3533,Nixon,That's my style. I like to kick 'em when they're down!,322
3534,Bender,"Ones ... zeros ... one, one, zero, zero, one--",323
3535,Fry,"Bender, what is it?",323
3536,Bender,"Whoa, what an awful dream. Ones and zeros everywhere. And I thought I saw a two.",323
3537,Fry,"It was just a dream, Bender. There's no such thing as two.",323
3538,Bender,"I know what this is about. My body loved me, and I turned it's back on it. Well, old friend, tie a yellow ribbon round your neck, 'cause I'm a-comin' home!",323
3539,Bender,You sold my body? To who?,324
3540,Pawnbroker,"I can't reveal that information, but you look like a nice robot. Tell you what, I'll give you 50 bucks for the kid.",324
3541,Fry,"Hey, my clothes are worth 50 bucks!",324
3542,Pawnbroker,Deal.,324
3543,Bender,Oh! How could I let this happen? I can't go through the rest of my life like this.,325
3544,Farnsworth,Don't you have a self-destruct button?,325
3545,Bender,"Yeah, but it's on my body. What am I gonna do?",325
3546,Fry,"Ah, I can't stand to see a robot cry. Let's watch TV!",325
3547,Nixon,"And so, ladies and gentlemen, I'm throwing my head into the ring. I'm announcing my candidacy for the presidency of Earth.",325
3548,Journalist #1,Just one question.,325
3549,Scoop Chang,"Scoop Chang, Beijing Bugle. Sir, the constitution clearly states that nobody can be elected president more than twice.",325
3550,Nixon,"That's right. Nobody.  But as you can plainly see, I've got a shiny new body!",325
3551,Bender,Oh!,325
3552,Leela,"Bender, he's got your body!",325
3553,Bender,"That dirty, double-crossing bastard! How dare he run off with Richard Nixon!",325
3554,Leela,Nixon must have bought your body from the pawn shop.,325
3555,Fry,"Yeah, and that electric guitar.",325
3556,Nixon,"Remember what the dormouse said,Feed your head. I'm meeting you half way, you stupid hippies!  I am not a crook's head!",325
3557,Bender,"Yeah, you are, you stole my body! Fry, Leela, you gotta help me!",325
3558,Leela,"Ordinarily I'd say no and lecture you on how this is your own fault for being such an idiot. But when a robotic Nixon is on the loose, we have a duty to take action. Idiot.",325
3559,Morbo,Morbo will now introduce tonight's candidates,327
3560,Nixon,"Hello, Morbo. How's the family?",327
3561,Morbo,Belligerent and numerous.,327
3562,Nixon,Good man. Nixon's pro-war and pro-family.,327
3563,Bender,"Great. First he steals my body, now he's touching my stuff.",327
3564,Leela,Come on. We've gotta find some way to talk to him.,327
3565,Morbo,Morbo demands an answer to the following question,327
3566,Johnson,Unthinkable.,327
3567,Jackson,I wouldn't think of it.,327
3568,Morbo,"What about you, Mr. Nixon? I remind you, you are under a truth-o-scope.",327
3569,Nixon,"Uh, well, I, uh ... the question is-is vague. You don't say what kind of candy, whether anyone is watching or, uh...  At any rate, I certainly wouldn't harm the child.",327
3570,Nixon's campaign manager,"You scored big points tonight, sir.",328
3571,Nixon,What are you talking about? They ate me alive out there.,328
3572,Nixon's campaign manager,"Yes, but your body stayed on message. And that message is, ""Look at my shiny new body"". The robots ate it up. You've got real charisma from the neck down.",328
3573,Nixon,"Nixon with charisma? My God, I can rule the universe!",328
3574,Bender,"Give me my body back, you two-bit thief!",328
3575,Nixon,"Now, look here, you drugged-out Communist. I paid for this body and I'd no sooner return it than I would my little cocker spaniel dog, Checkers.  Shut up, damnit!",328
3576,Fry,"Please, Mr. Nixon. We're appealing to your sense of decency.",328
3577,Bender,That was a good one!,328
3578,Nixon,"Seriously though, I'm never giving back this body. Now beat it! Before I get Cambodian on your asses!",328
3579,Bender,It's hopeless. We might as well turn in my head for the five cent deposit.,329
3580,Fry,"No way! I'm not letting my best friend get recycled. Not for five cents, not for five hundred cents! Leela, I've got a plan!",329
3581,Leela,I've got a better plan.,329
3582,Fry,Why would Nixon stay at the Watergate?,330
3583,Leela,They give you a discount if you've been here before.,330
3584,Fry,"Keep going, we're right behind you.",330
3585,Bender,"Whoa, mama! Get a room, you two!",330
3586,Man,We're in a room!,330
3587,Bender,Well then lose some weight.,330
3588,Nixon,Aroo!,330
3589,Nixon,"Oh, yeah. You women's libbers really know how to party!",330
3590,Bender,Psst! There I am!,330
3591,Nixon,"Hey, Betty Friedan, send a little of that lotion my way!",330
3592,Leela,"OK, almost got it. Steady. Steady. Don't panic.",330
3593,Fry,Ooh!  Uh-oh!,330
3594,Nixon,What the--  You shaggy peaceniks have some nerve!,330
3595,Bender,I'm just here for what's mine. Don't make me kick your neck.,330
3596,Nixon,"Bring it on, soup can.",330
3597,Leela,"Alright, break it up, you two!",330
3598,Nixon,"That's it. You're all going to jail. And don't expect me to grant a pardon like that sissy, Ford.",330
3599,Leela,You'll never pardon anybody because you'll never get elected president. The voters of Earth aren't the pea-brained idiots they were back in your time.,330
3600,Nixon,"Oh, no? Well, listen here, missy. Computers may be twice as fast as they were in 1973 but your average voter is as drunk and stupid as ever. The only one who's changed is me. I've become bitter and, let's face it, crazy over the years. And once I'm swept into office, I'll sell our children's organs to zoos for meat and I'll go into people's houses at night and wreck up the place.",330
3601,Fry,"Well, he lost my vote.",330
3602,Nixon,"Like one vote ever made a difference. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to inch myself over to the phone and call the police.",330
3603,Bender,"Not so fast, Nixon! Are you familiar with audio tape?",330
3604,Nixon,Uh-oh. I don't like where this is heading.,330
3605,Nixon,And I'll go into people's houses at night and wreck up the place!,330
3606,Nixon,My God? I really sound like that? I thought my voice had more of a Clark Gable quality.,330
3607,Leela,"The jig's up, Nixon. We'll trade you the tape for the body.",330
3608,Nixon,"Oh, expletive deleted. You've got a deal.",330
3609,Fry,"Hey, I've got one last thought.",330
3610,Bender,"Ah, it's good to be back in one piece again. Except I can't get these damn bumper stickers off.",331
3611,Linda,The sheer drama of this election has driven voter turnout to its highest level in centuries. 6%,331
3612,Morbo,Exit polls show evil underdog Richard Nixon trailing with an estimated zero votes.,331
3613,Leela,Yes! The system works!,331
3614,Linda,The time is 7,331
3615,Leela,No!,331
3616,Fry,What?,331
3617,Bender,Get out of town!,331
3618,Fry,Why would robots vote for Nixon now that he's just a head in a jar?,331
3619,Nixon's campaign manager,I give you the next president of Earth!,331
3620,Nixon,Nixon's back!,331
3621,Farnsworth,I can't believe it. He won by a single vote.,331
3622,Bender,"Well it ain't my fault. I'm a non-voting felon, thank you.",331
3623,Fry,Well it's not my fault either 'cause I forgot to vote.,331
3624,Leela,"Oh, crud. I knew there was something I meant to do today.",331
3625,Morbo,Morbo congratulates our gargantuan cyborg president. May death come quickly to his enemies.,331
3626,[Scene,Washington D.C. Street. People run away as Nixon uproots trees and crushes cars to,332
3627,Nixon,Aroo! Who's kicking who around now?  Aroo! Aroo!,332
3628,Nixon,"Knock, knock!",332
3629,Announcer,"Ladies and gentlemen, Conan O'Brien's head.",333
3630,O'Brien,"Thank you, thank you. Let's get started. Max, play me over.  So, people are getting pretty worried about this Y2K problem, huh?",333
3631,Bender,"No, they fixed that 900 years ago.",333
3632,O'Brien,"Just bear with me, sir. Anyway, I'm walking to work this morning--",333
3633,Bender,I doubt it!,333
3634,O'Brien,"Listen, pal, I may have lost my freakishly long legs in the war of 2012 but I've still got something you'll never have",333
3635,Bender,Eh.,333
3636,O'Brien,"And freckles!  Well, I'm out of material. You can catch me next week at the Andromeda Chuckle Hut. Enjoy your breakfast.",333
3637,Bender,"Ah, let's face it",334
3638,Farnsworth,"Come on, everyone. Perhaps some skiing will help us forget the mouldy old antics of Conan O'Brien.",334
3639,Amy,Yeah!,334
3640,Leela,Great idea!,334
3641,Zoidberg,We can only hope!,334
3642,Fry,This snow is beautiful. I'm glad global warming never happened.,334
3643,Leela,Actually it did. But thank God nuclear winter cancelled it out.,334
3644,Fry,Hi!,334
3645,Bender,"Enough of your mindless chitchat, let's get going.",334
3646,Hermes,Jah damnit! We're stuck.,334
3647,Zoidberg,At least you're not cold-blooded!,334
3648,Hermes,Sweet lion of Zion! Look at the Professor go.,334
3649,Fry,Look out! We're heading straight for those trees!,334
3650,Leela,"Yeah, yeah, relax. Trees down.",334
3651,Trees,Trees down.,334
3652,Fry,"Cool. Hey, what do you do if you want the trees up?",334
3653,Trees,Trees up.,334
3654,Fry,Trees down!,334
3655,Trees,Trees down.,334
3656,Bender,"Lookin' good, meatball!",334
3657,Man #1,"Excuse me, sir, you're snowboarding off the trail.",334
3658,Bender,"Lick my frozen, metal ass.  Uh-oh!",334
3659,Child,Mommy!,334
3660,Zoidberg,"You, a bobsledder? That I'd like to see!",334
3661,Hermes,"Listen, you filthy crab, a thousand years ago there was a legendary team of Jamaican bobsledders.",334
3662,Fry,"Yup, I remember. They came in last at the Olympics then retired to promote alcoholic beverages.",334
3663,Hermes,A true inspiration for the children.  Nooo!,334
3664,Fry,"Oh, what the hell!  Ow!",334
3665,Amy,You poor man. What happened to you?,335
3666,Man #2,"Well, there I was on the triple diamond slope, when suddenly--",335
3667,Amy,"Oh, excuse me.  Hello, there!",335
3668,Farnsworth,Wha?,335
3669,Bender,Ah! Nothing like a warm fire and a Super Soaker of fine cognac.,335
3670,Fry,"Yeah, it really puts you in the Christmas spirit.",335
3671,Farnsworth,What-mas?,335
3672,Fry,Christmas. You know? X-M-A-S.,335
3673,Leela,"Oh, you mean Xmas. You must be using an archaic pronunciation. Like when you say ""ask"" instead of ""aks"".",335
3674,Fry,"Xmas, huh?  Y'know, this'll be my first Xmas away from home.",335
3675,Leela,"Hey, hey. Let me aks you something",335
3676,Fry,Yeah! An old-fashioned Xmas tree!,335
3677,Fry,Hey! These aren't Xmas trees!,336
3678,Farnsworth,"Eh, wha?",336
3679,Fry,"They're supposed to be some kinda, you know, pine tree.",336
3680,Farnsworth,"Pine trees have been extinct for 800 years, Fry. Gone the way of the poodle and your primitive notions of modesty.  Ah! Brisk!",336
3681,Fry,This isn't the way Christmas is supposed to be.,336
3682,Farnsworth,"There, there.",336
3683,Fry,Everything's changed.,336
3684,Leela,That's not true.,336
3685,Bender,,337
3686,Amy,Ow!,337
3687,Fry,Every Christmas my mom would get a fresh goose for goose burgers and my dad would whip up his special eggnog out of bourbon and ice cubes.  This dumb holiday just makes me think of all the things I left behind. Let's just stop talking about Xmas.,337
3688,Hermes,"Happy Xmas, Xmas people! Xmas cards have arrived! Xmas!  Amy, there you go. Fry, Professor, Zoidberg, a mighty haul for Bender.",337
3689,Bender,Yes! I got the most! I win Xmas!,337
3690,Hermes,"And last, but not least, the sweet flower of the office",337
3691,Bender,"Hmm.  Ah, a picture of my mommy.",337
3692,Zoidberg,"Huh? What's this?  Instead of ""Claus"" he writes ""Claws""! Now that's humorous. Today's comedians could learn from this card.",337
3693,Fry,What's the point of Xmas when everyone you know died a thousand years ago? I'm the loneliest person on Earth.  Yoiks! What was that about?,339
3694,Amy,Fluh! She's an orphan.,339
3695,Farnsworth,"Yes, and the only one of her species in all the known universe. What a lonely life.",339
3696,Fry,My God! Poor Leela.,339
3697,Bender,"Oh, man, I gotta work on my act!",339
3698,Fry,I feel like a rat. Here I am whining like a pig while all along Leela was lonely as a frog. I could kick myself.,339
3699,Amy,I'll do it for you.,339
3700,Fry,Ow! Thanks.,339
3701,Farnsworth,"You should be ashamed of yourself, Fry. You'd have to be blind not to notice that Leela's a cyclops.",339
3702,Hermes,"Fry's over there, man.",339
3703,Farnsworth,Oh?,339
3704,Bender,Xmas Eve; another pointless day where I accomplish nothing.,339
3705,Linda,The holiday season is a time of celebration for most. But it is also a time to remember the tragic suffering of the less fortunate.,339
3706,Morbo,Earthlings do not yet know the meaning of suffering.,339
3707,Linda,"Homeless robots, too poor to afford even the basic alcohol they need to fuel their circuits. Is there anything sadder? Only drowning puppies. And there would have to be a lot of them.",339
3708,Amy,"Where are you going, Bender?",339
3709,Bender,To volunteer at a liquor kitchen for homeless robots.,339
3710,Hermes,"Yeah, right! As if you ever did anything charitable.",339
3711,Bender,I'm very generous. What about that time I gave blood?,339
3712,Fry,Whose blood?,339
3713,Bender,Some guy's.,339
3714,Fry,I've got to do something to show Leela how sorry I am.,339
3715,Zoidberg,So what's the problem? Just get down on your claws and do the apology dance.,339
3716,Fry,"So it's left, left, right-- Wait! I have a better idea! I'll go out and get her the perfect Xmas present. Something so great she'll never want to be unhappy again.",339
3717,Hermes,"Just be back by sundown, mon.",339
3718,Fry,We'll see. I like to haggle.,339
3719,Amy,You can't stay out on Xmas Eve. You'll be killed!,339
3720,Fry,Say what?,339
3721,Farnsworth,Good Lord! He doesn't know about Santa Claus.,339
3722,Fry,I know about Santa Claus.,339
3723,Farnsworth,"Back in 2801, the Friendly Robot Company built a robotic Santa to determine who'd be naughty and who'd been nice and distribute presents accordingly. But something went wrong.",339
3724,Fry,Wow! 2801! Anyway...,339
3725,Farnsworth,"Wait, you fool! Due to a programming error, Santa's standards were set too high and he invariably judges everyone to be naughty.",339
3726,Amy,"If he catches you after dark, he'll chop off your head and stuff your neck full of toys from his sack of horrors.",339
3727,Farnsworth,Nice meeting you.,339
3728,Preacherbot,"Welcome, brother! May the blessings of the season be upon you.",340
3729,Bender,"Yeah, yeah, amen. Listen, I'm one of those lazy homeless bums I've been hearing about. Could you point me to the free booze.  Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!",340
3730,Fry,There's this girl who I really like but she thinks I'm a jerk. Can you help me?,341
3731,Salesman #1,"Yeah, there's a suicide booth in the food court. Though there's a line this time of year.",341
3732,Fry,"No, I need to get her a gift. And I need it before sundown.",341
3733,Salesman #1,"Well, you can't go wrong with something traditional.  A Surface-to-Santa rocket launcher. It comes with three jolly-seeking missiles.",341
3734,Fry,That's funny!,341
3735,Salesman #1,"Careful, sir!",341
3736,Bender,"Oh, yeah! You filthy hobos sure know how to live.  Hey, chief, someone's stealing your handkerchief full of crap.",342
3737,Tinny Tim,"Excuse me, sir? Might I have a sip of booze?",342
3738,Preacherbot,"I'm sorry, Tinny Tim. Seems we ran out early tonight.",342
3739,Tinny Tim,I understand.,342
3740,Bender,My God! That poor kid!,342
3741,Fry,You're the last store open. I need something for my friend Leela.  Just give me your best animal.,343
3742,Salesman #2,Best? Well that's a matter of opinion. I personally like the Electric Snail.,343
3743,Fry,That's a stupid animal. You're stupid! I said I want the best one. Now which costs more? The parrot or the Stink Lizard?,343
3744,Salesman #2,"The lizards are a buck each, the parrot is $500.",343
3745,Fry,"That's a hell of a good parrot. Although, I could get 500 lizards for the same price. Girls like swarms of lizards, right?",343
3746,Salesman #2,"Sir, the store is closing in two minutes.",343
3747,Fry,"Alright, I'll take the 500 lizards. No, wait, yes. No. Yes. Yes. Yes! The parrot!",343
3748,Fry,"Well, I spent every penny I had but I bet Leela's gonna love you.  Stupid bird! I know where you live.",344
3749,Amy,"Hey, it's Leela.",345
3750,Leela,Sorry I stormed out before. I didn't mean to ruin everyone's Xmas.,345
3751,Farnsworth,Huh? You were gone?,345
3752,Leela,It's just that I get tired of Fry always only thinking of himself.,345
3753,Hermes,"I hear that! I aks him to set the table, instead he goes out to buy you a present. Selfish dog.",345
3754,Leela,Wait! You mean he's still out? His life's in danger!,345
3755,Zoidberg,Why?,345
3756,Leela,I'm telling you why. Santa Claus is coming to town!,345
3757,Fry,"Alright, bird, you thought you could beat me in a game of wits. But you just met your equal.",346
3758,Fry,Aha! Cornered!,346
3759,Leela,"Hi, there!",346
3760,Fry,"Leela! Oh, my God! You saved my life. I am gonna get you so many lizards!",346
3761,Leela,"You didn't need to buy me a present, Fry.",347
3762,Fry,"I just wanted to do something to make you happy. I mean, I miss my family but you never even had a family.",347
3763,Leela,"It's OK. You're lonely and I'm lonely. But, together, we're lonely together.",347
3764,Fry,"Merry Xmas, Leela.",347
3765,Leela,Merry Xmas.,347
3766,Fry,"Oh, boy! It's Santa!",347
3767,Santa,"Ho, ho, ho!  You've been very naughty, Fry and Leela. I checked my list.",347
3768,Fry,Well check it twice!,347
3769,Santa,I perform over 50 mega-checks per second. You're both naughty for disregarding each other's feelings.,347
3770,Leela,But we set things right. Fry even risked his life to get me a present.,347
3771,Santa,But what about your other co-workers? Did either of you ever stop to think about Dr. Zoidberg's feelings?,347
3772,Fry,No! I swear!,347
3773,Santa,Santa has something very special in his sack for you two!,347
3774,Robots,"So lock the door and hit the floor,'Cause Santa Claus comes tonight.",348
3775,Hattie,Go away!,348
3776,Bender,"Whoa, hold on! How about inviting us in for a traditional glass of hard cider?",348
3777,Hattie,"Oh, alright. But just one glass!  I said that's enough!",348
3778,Bender,Get her purse!,348
3779,Fry,Please let us live! We'll put out milk and cookies for you!,349
3780,Santa,You dare bribe Santa? I'm going to shove coal so far up your stocking you'll be coughing up diamonds!,349
3781,Leela,We're trapped.,349
3782,Fry,I never thought it would end this way,349
3783,Leela,"Goodbye, Fry.",349
3784,Fry,"Goodbye, Leela.  Hey, look, we're under the mistletoe.",349
3785,Santa,Your mistletoe is no match for my T.O.W. missile!,349
3786,Fry,"Uh, you're present may need some assembly.",349
3787,Bender,On the 4th day of Xmas I stole from that lady.,349
3788,Robot #1,Four family photos.,349
3789,Tinny Tim,Three jars of pennies.,349
3790,Robot #2,Two former husbands.,349
3791,Bender,And a slipper on a shoe tree.,349
3792,Raoul,"Oh, thank you!",349
3793,Fry,Help!,349
3794,Leela,Somebody help us.,349
3795,Tinny Tim,"It's humans. Shall we mug them, robot sir?",349
3796,Bender,"No, wait, I know these guys. They got nothing.",349
3797,Santa,"Ho, ho, ho!  You've been very naughty, Bender.",349
3798,Bender,What? Me? I didn't do nothing. You're thinking of the kid.,349
3799,Santa,"My God, Bender! Framing an orphan? That's so naughty I'll have to add it to my list right now.  ... an...",349
3800,Zoidberg,"Amy, this is for you. A set of combs for your beautiful hair.",350
3801,Amy,"Oh, that's so sweet. But I sold my hair to a wigmaker so I could buy a set of combs for Hermes.",350
3802,Hermes,"Oh, the irony. I sold my hair so I could buy this third set of combs for Zoidberg.",350
3803,Zoidberg,Thank you. These'll come in handy for my new hair.  Finally I look as pretty as I feel!,350
3804,Fry,Help!,350
3805,Leela,Help!,350
3806,Bender,Help!,350
3807,Farnsworth,"Oh, dear. They'll be killed on our doorstep. And there's no trash pickup until January 3rd.",350
3808,Hermes,Sweet manatee of Galilee! He's on the roof!,350
3809,Farnsworth,Quick! The armour-plated chimney cover!  Push! Push!,350
3810,Bender,Use teamwork!,350
3811,Tinny Tim,"Oh, dear! Oh, dear!",350
3812,Santa,"You've all been very naughty, very naughty indeed. Except you, Dr. Zoidberg, this is for you.",350
3813,Zoidberg,A pogo-stick!,350
3814,Santa,"As for the rest of you, I'm going to tear off your skin like wrapping paper and deck the halls with your guts.",350
3815,Bender,"Yeah? Well I don't believe in Santa Claus. Come on, everybody, if you don't believe in him, he can't hurt you.  Ow! God! The pain!",350
3816,Santa,"Ho, ho, ho! Time to get jolly on your naughty asses!",350
3817,Leela,Watch out! His belly is shaking like a bowl full of nitro-glycerine!,350
3818,Amy,Rudolph's nose!,350
3819,Fry,He's gonna blow!,350
3820,Zoidberg,Aha!,350
3821,Farnsworth,"Yes, good thing I got us out of that one!",351
3822,Bender,"Xmas dinner, everyone.",351
3823,Fry,"Uh, Bender? Where did you get that bird?",351
3824,Bender,"I found it lying in the street, like all the food I cook. Dig in, everyone.",351

3828,Tinny Tim,I'm so hungry.,351
3829,Fry,"The important thing is we're all together for Xmas. And even though I'm surrounded by robots and monsters and old people, I've never felt more at home.",351
3830,Farnsworth,"Hear, hear! Now let's all of us shut up and sing!",351
3831,Amy,He knows when you are sleeping.,351
3832,Farnsworth,He knows when you're on the can.,351
3833,Leela,He'll hunt you down and blast your ass from here to Pakistan.,351
3834,Zoidberg,Oh.,351

3839,Santa,I'll be back. Back when you least expect it,351
3840,Singer,Call Robo-Rooter when you flush your towel.,352
3841,Plumber-bot,And we can also help with an impacted bowel.,352
3842,Singer,Robo-Rooter!,352
3843,Fry,Mmm. Mmm! Now this is what I call a thousand years of progress,352
3844,Bender,"Aw, jeez. Let's just pray I have the energy to get myself another beer.  Oh, what is this, the Middle Ages?",352
3845,Leela,"Look at you guys. No offence, Fry, but you've become a fat sack of crap.",352
3846,Fry,Sack?,352
3847,Amy,"And, Bender, your beer belly's so big your door won't even close. And that doesn't even make sense.",352
3848,Leela,Come on. We're taking you pigs to the gym.,352
3849,Zoidberg,"The gymnasium? Excellent, excellent. For some reason I'm frisky as a squid on Tuesday.",352
3850,Amy,"Hey, who's up for a nice, hot steam?",353
3851,Zoidberg,We crustaceans don't like steam. I'm going to go work out with the Nautilus!,353
3852,Nautilus,"What up, Dr. Z?",353
3853,Zoidberg,"Yo, yo, yo! Whassup, whassup! Give up the rock!",353
3854,Fry,Co-ed steam rooms! I love the future!,354
3855,Leela,"Uh, Fry, you're in the women's steam room.",354
3856,Fry,"Ah, futuristic!",354
3857,Amy,"Psst, look what life was like before genetic engineering.",354
3858,Leela,Those poor 20th century women.,354
3859,Amy,"Hey, handsome. Is there room in there for two?",355
3860,Man,You wish!,355
3861,Fry,"Hey, Leela, look who's the super-stud!",356
3862,Leela,"Hmm, somebody must have turned down the gravity. I'll fix it for you.",356
3863,Zoidberg,Give me that.  More weight!,356
3864,Fry,"Hey, Dr. Zoidberg, what's that jazz on your head?",356
3865,Zoidberg,Enough with the questions. More weight!  More!,356
3866,Leela,Maybe you could do more reps with less weight.,356
3867,Bender,"Hey, looks like Zoidberg's finally coming out of his shell.  He's coming out--",356
3868,Randy,"Nice and gentle, we don't want any unnecessary stress.  Is there a doctor in the gym?",356
3869,Zoidberg,I'm a doctor!,356
3870,Leela,I wonder why Dr. Zoidberg is acting this way. Out of all of us he always seemed the most normal.,357
3871,Zoidberg,"I am normal.  Amy, take off these rubber bands and I'll show you how normal I am!",357
3872,Amy,"Fool me seven times, shame on you. Fool me eight or more times, shame on me.",357
3873,Fry,Maybe he has a parasite.,357
3874,Hermes,Maybe he is a parasite!,357
3875,Bender,It's always so sad when a friend goes crazy and you have to have a big clam-bake and cook him! Yee-haw!,357
3876,Farnsworth,"Now, now, this won't do. Let me just give old Zoidy a sedative.",357
3877,Zoidberg,"Ah, much better. You can take off these rubber bands now.",357
3878,Amy,I'll do it.,357
3879,Leela,Stop!,357
3880,Fry,"No, Amy!",357
3881,Bender,Moron!,357
3882,Farnsworth,Mm-hm...  Aha! There's the problem.,357
3883,Zoidberg,"Give it to me straight, Professor. Is it fin rot? It's fin rot, isn't it? Tell me it's not fin rot!",357
3884,Farnsworth,"Relax, my chiton-y chum. There's no problem. You're just heavy with male jelly.",357
3885,Leela,Bleck!,357
3886,Farnsworth,It must be mating season for Zoidberg's people; a chaotic time when his behaviour is dictated by the tiny brain in his rump.,357
3887,Fry,Eck!,357
3888,Farnsworth,There's only one thing we can do--,357
3889,Bender,I'll get the water boiling!,357
3890,Farnsworth,"We, by which I mean you, will have to rush him to his ancient homeworld which will shortly erupt in an orgy of invertebrate sex.",357
3891,Fry,"Oh, baby, I'm there!",357
3892,Leela,"Fry, do you even understand the word ""invertebrate""?",357
3893,Fry,"Nope, but that's not the word I'm interested in.  Uh, no need to pack pants, people. Let's roll!",357
3894,Amy,Dr. Zoidberg said I should hold these while he's gone.,357
3895,Bender,Moron!,357
3896,Decapodian Man #1,"Welcome home, old friend. Just 19 hours until the mating frenzy!",358
3897,Zoidberg,"Excellent, excellent!",358
3898,Decapodian Man #1,"See you there, Doctor--",358
3899,Fry,"Is that how you say ""Zoidberg""?",358
3900,Zoidberg,You didn't have to call attention to his speech impediment.,358
3901,Bender,"You're looking less nuts, crabby.",359
3902,Zoidberg,"I'm feeling less nuts, thank you, because tomorrow I will be depositing my jelly in the cloacal vents of a female.  If you catch my drift.",359
3903,Fry,Who's the lucky lobsterina?,359
3904,Zoidberg,I don't know yet. But I shall attract one this afternoon with an erotic display.,359
3905,Leela,It's amazing that your people can fall in love so fast.,359
3906,Zoidberg,Love? That word is unknown here. I'm simply looking for a female swollen with eggs to accept my genetic material.,359
3907,Fry,"You and me both, brother!",359
3908,Zoidberg,"Ah, my old scuttling grounds! Let's pull over.",359
3909,Zoidberg,"I used to hang out here as a larva. It looked so much bigger back then.  Who's the tough guy now, Vinnie?",360
3910,Bender,"Look! Outdoor theatre! Let's get tickets. Oh, let's do!",361
3911,Zoidberg,"No, it's the ceremony of Claw-Plach, where my species fight to the death over matters of honour. Also whether abbreviations count in Scrabble.  They don't!",361
3912,Fry,I didn't come here to see any activity involving two guys. Where do you people do your erotic display?,361
3913,Zoidberg,Same place as your species,361
3914,Zoidberg,How do I look?,362
3915,Bender,Like whale barf.,362
3916,Zoidberg,Then the illusion is complete.,362
3917,Fry,"Hey, I wonder if these guys are here to watch the erotic display too.",362
3918,Decapodian Man #2,"Aw, yeah! Aw, wow!",362
3919,Zoidberg,Perfect! This oughta make me stand out.  Craw!,362
3920,Fry,Look how ridiculous they look.,362
3921,Bender,"Please, he's no different from the rest of you organisms; shooting DNA at each other make babies. I find it offensive.",362
3922,Zoidberg,Craw!,362
3923,Decapodian Woman #1,Keep your jelly away from my eggs!,362
3924,Zoidberg,Craw?,362
3925,Decapodian Woman #2,So not interested.,362
3926,Zoidberg,Craw!,362
3927,Decapodian Woman #3,Humph. I've heard that line before!,362
3928,Zoidberg,"Cra-- Oh, what's the point?",362
3929,Leela,Why is Zoidberg the only one still alone?,362
3930,Bender,"'Cause he's a loser, that's why. He's the lobster equivalent of Fry.",362
3931,Fry,Hey! I can get any girl I want anytime I want. I'm just too busy.,362
3932,Zoidberg,"Edna? Edna, it's me, Zoidberg. Remember, from high school?  You used to laugh at me because my face was covered with barnacles!",362
3933,Edna,Zoidberg? Well I didn't know you were back in town. I heard you went off and became a rich doctor.,362
3934,Zoidberg,"I've performed a few mercy killings. So, as long as I'm in town I was wondering if maybe ... craw?",362
3935,Edna,"Oh, gee, yeah, I'm just going through a lot of things right now and-- Look, Zoidberg, I carry more eggs than any other female and I owe it to our race to pick a mate who's stuffed with male jelly. Maybe a rock star.",362
3936,Zoidberg,Or maybe a doctor?,362
3937,Edna,"I'm sorry, Zoidberg. You're just an inferior male specimen. Nice seeing you again.",362
3938,Zoidberg,"No one will ever want to mate with me, not with a puny claw like this. Did you see those other guys? They looked like giant claws with bodies attached.",363
3939,Leela,At least you didn't smell as bad as them.,363
3940,Zoidberg,"You're right, my stink gland is weak. Smell!",363
3941,Fry,"Listen, Doc, if you wanna score you gotta fake like you're in love.  ""I've never been so happy.""",363
3942,Leela,If a guy ever did that to me I'd know it. Wait a second. They've all been doing that to me. Even Sean!,363
3943,Zoidberg,"Hmm, this ""love"" intrigues me. Teach me to fake it.",363
3944,Fry,"OK, you're on a date. What's the first thing you do?",364
3945,Zoidberg,Ask her to mate with me.,364
3946,Fry,No. Tell her she's special.,364
3947,Zoidberg,But she's not. She's merely the female with the largest clutch of eggs.,364
3948,Fry,"Well, tell her that. And then?",364
3949,Zoidberg,Then mating.,364
3950,Fry,No. Make up some feelings and tell her you have them.  Yes?,364
3951,Zoidberg,"Is ""desire to mate"" a feeling?",364
3952,Fry,You're not even trying!,364
3953,Zoidberg,It's all so complicated with the flowers and the romance and the lies upon lies.,364
3954,Fry,"OK, OK, don't worry. The love meister will take you under his wing.",364
3955,Zoidberg,What? Now there's a bird involved?,364
3956,Fry,"OK, go ahead.",365
3957,Edna,"What the-- Dr. Zoidberg, your mating display failed. Why are you trying to talk to me?",365
3958,Zoidberg,I have no idea.,365
3959,Fry,"You just wanna talk, it has nothing to do with mating.",365
3960,Zoidberg,"Fry, that doesn't make sense.",365
3961,Edna,"Dr. Zoidberg, that doesn't make sense. But OK.",365
3962,Fry,Start with a compliment. Tell her she looks thin.,365
3963,Zoidberg,You seem malnourished. Are you suffering from internal parasites?,365
3964,Edna,"Why, yes. Thanks for noticing.",365
3965,Fry,Now ask her how her day was.,365
3966,Zoidberg,Why would I wanna know?,365
3967,Fry,You wouldn't. Ask anyway.,365
3968,Zoidberg,How was your day?,365
3969,Edna,Well first I got up and had a piece of toast. Then I brushed my teeth. Then I went to the store to buy some fish. Then...,365
3970,Zoidberg,"Fry, look what you did, she won't shut up.",365
3971,Fry,"That's normal. Just nod your head and say ""Uh-huh"".",365
3972,Zoidberg,"Uh-huh, uh-huh.",365
3973,Edna,"...And then you threw an octopus at my window. You know, Zoidberg, it's crazy but when you talk this way your obvious deficiencies as a male seem ... less obvious. Your genes seem less detrimental.  You even stink more.",365
3974,Zoidberg,Do I ask her to mate now?,365
3975,Fry,Third date!,365
3976,Bender,So I returned his artificial heart and ever since then I've been known by the name of Honest Bender.,366
3977,Zoidberg,I'd like to propose a toast to ... coat check number 84.,366
3978,Fry,Turn it over.,366
3979,Zoidberg,"Oh, Edna!  Of all the slimy, gross crab monsters on this planet, you are apparently the hottest.",366
3980,Bender,Oy.,366
3981,Fry,That's the most beautiful thing I've ever heard.,366
3982,Edna,"Yes, well ... excuse me, I've got to powder my mouth flaps.",366
3983,Leela,"Uh, me too.",366
3984,Zoidberg,"I'm confused, Fry. I'm feeling a strange new emotion. Is it love when you care about a female for reasons beyond mating?",366
3985,Fry,Nope. Must be some weird alien emotion.,366
3986,Leela,"Zoidberg said some dumb stuff but he's a nice guy, really. It's just that Fry's been telling him what to say and Fry's a ... do you have idiots on your planet?",367
3987,Edna,Fry? You mean words of such beauty came from the blowhole of that hideous alien?,367
3988,Leela,"Yeah ... what? Look, never mind the words. Zoidberg's a doctor. A doctor, honey.",367
3989,Edna,Hmm.,367
3990,Edna,Come in.,368
3991,Edna,"Hello, Fry. Can I interest you in some surf and turf?",368
3992,Fry,No thanks. I just came to tell you that Zoidberg's really great. He's got male jelly coming out the wazoo.,368
3993,Edna,"Well that is where it comes out but jelly isn't everything.  I know Zoidberg's magical words were really yours. Teach me to love you, squishy poet from beyond the stars!",368
3994,Fry,"Uh, I'm flattered, really. If I was gonna do it with a big, freaky mud bug you'd be way up the list!",368
3995,Edna,"Hush, you romantic fool! Engage your mandibles and kiss me!",368
3996,Zoidberg,"Edna, I couldn't stand it any longer. I--  Fry!",368
3997,Fry,"Dr. Zoidberg, it's not how it looks.",368
3998,Zoidberg,Her caviar is on your neck!,368
3999,Fry,But--,368
4000,Edna,"Oh, it's true, Zoidberg. We can't hide it any longer. Fry and I have fallen in love and we're going to mate tomorrow.",368
4001,Fry,What?,368
4002,Zoidberg,I challenge you to Claw-Plach!,368
4003,Fry,"English, please?",368
4004,Zoidberg,A fight to the death.,368
4005,Edna,"And if you survive, we'll make sweet love!",368
4006,Decapodian Emperor,The law is clear. Fry and Zoidberg shall fight to the death for the claw of the beautiful Edna.,369
4007,Fry,But I don't want her!,369
4008,Decapodian Emperor,"Once invoked, the sacred tradition of Claw-Plach can not be taken back. It is a recent tradition, only 18 years old, but it is a tradition none the less.",369
4009,Zoidberg,"Get ready, Fry. I'm going to rip your swim bladder out and show it to you.",370
4010,Leela,"Dr. Zoidberg, this is madness. You're being irrational.",370
4011,Zoidberg,Of course I'm being irrational! I'm in love!,370
4012,Leela,Aww.,370
4013,Fry,Leela!,370
4014,Leela,"Right, right.  You have to stop this madness.",370
4015,Decapodian Emperor,"Listen, lady, as you can plainly see I'm a highly desirable male, groaning with jelly. Yet I embrace a life of celibacy in order to uphold our crazy traditions. One of your friends must die.",370
4016,Bender,"Fate is cruel and unyielding and what must be must be.  Takin' all bets! I'm giving 9-2 on Zoidberg, the crab with the jab! The Great Red Hope! Come on, baby!",370
4017,Zoidberg,"Fry, it's been years since medical school so remind me. Disembowelling in your species",370
4018,Fry,Fatal.,370
4019,Zoidberg,Large bet on myself in round one!,370
4020,Decapodian Emperor,"Edna, have you anything to say before begins the Claw-Plach?",370
4021,Edna,I do. I just want to say that today I got up and I had a piece of toast. Then I brushed my teeth--,370
4022,Fry,Shut up!,370
4023,Edna,"I love you, Fry!",370
4024,Decapodian Emperor,"Fry, having guessed what animal I was thinking of, you shall have first choice of weapon.  And you, doctor?",370
4025,Zoidberg,I choose my own claws! I want the tactile pleasure of chopping him right here in the gonads!,370
4026,Fry,Shh! Nobody correct him!,370
4027,Bender,"Fry, I've never asked you for anything before but, if it's not too much trouble, when it comes to the ninth round just let him win.",370
4028,Fry,But it's a fight to the death!,370
4029,Bender,"Oh, so this is suddenly all about you. Sheesh!",370
4030,Decapodian Emperor,Please rise for the national anthem.,370
4031,Fry,Uh-oh.,370
4032,Decapodian Emperor,Let Claw-Plach begin!,370
4033,Fry,Hey!,370
4034,Bender,Ow!,370
4035,Leela,"Come on, Fry! Die with dignity!",370
4036,Fry,Aha!  Oops!,370
4037,Edna,Nooo! I can't stand to look.,370
4038,Zoidberg,Huh?,370
4039,Bender,"Psst, Fry. Take a dive.",370
4040,Crowd,Claw-Plach! Claw-Plach!,370
4041,Fry,"My fellow fish monsters, far be it for me to question your stupid civilisation or its dumb customs, but is squeezing each other's brains out with a giant nutcracker really going to solve anything? Dr. Zoidberg is my friend, and though a woman has come between us, I say we'll always remain friends. And you know why?  You bastard! I'll kill you! You bastard!",370
4042,Leela,Wait! Stop! Everyone is gone.,370

4049,Fry,"Ow, ow! Ah!",370
4050,Zoidberg,The frenzy is over. How will I ever get rid of my male jelly now?,370

4057,Zoidberg,Yes.,370
4058,Fry,Tough call.,370
4059,Zoidberg,"Well it was nice of you to let me reattach your arm, Fry, especially after I made a complete eel out of myself.",371

4193,Hermes,"Take a rage dump, man. He's no worse than Bender.",384
4194,Fry,He's much worse. He drinks and smokes and he posts naked pictures of me on the Internet.,384
4195,Amy,"That's Bender, alright.",384
4196,Fry,I'm talking about Flexo.,384
4197,Leela,"Oh, I get it. This is cute. You're jealous of Bender's new friend!",384

4203,Amy,And huge.,385
4204,Fry,Can I touch it?,385
4205,Zoidberg,"So what is it, already?",385
4206,Farnsworth,"It's a single atom of jumbonium, an element so rare the nucleus alone is worth more than $50,000.",385
4207,Bender,How much more?,385
4208,Farnsworth,"100,000. That's why I hid it here, under my mattress.",385
4209,Leela,"Uh, Professor, can we discuss this somewhere else?",385
4210,Farnsworth,Why certainly.,385
4211,Farnsworth,"The atom sits atop this dimestore tiara which will be awarded to the winner of this year's Miss Universe pageant on the planet Tova 9.  Your job is to deliver it, safe and sound.",386
4212,Amy,Wow! When I was a little girl on Mars I dreamed of being Miss Universe.,386
4213,Leela,That's kinda pathetic.,386
4214,Amy,"Aw, come on, Leela. Deep down all girls wanna be Miss Universe.",386
4215,Leela,Not me.,386
4216,Amy,Really? Maybe it's just cute girls.,386
4217,Farnsworth,"Due to the atoms tremendous value, Planet Express would go bankrupt if it was stolen. Therefore we'll need to hire on additional security for the mission.",386
4218,Flexo,"Oh, oh, oh, oh! Mr. Professor, right here!",386
4219,Fry,"Uh, maybe we should stick with people we know and trust. I mean, Flexo's great, but--",386
4220,Farnsworth,"""Flexo's great,"" you say? Well that's good enough for me.  Welcome aboard, lad.",386
4221,Leela,"Space bandidos have been operating in this quadrant so you'll each take 8-hour shifts guarding the safe. First Bender, then Flexo, then Fry.",387
4222,Fry,"Wait, hold on. I don't like the sound of that. Let's just go alphabetically.",387
4223,Leela,"OK. First Bender, then Flexo, then Fry.",387
4224,Fry,"Wait, let's go by rank.",387
4225,Leela,"OK. First Bender, then Flexo, then Fry.",387
4226,Fry,Flexo outranks me?,387
4227,Flexo,"That's ""Flexo outranks me, sir""!",387
4228,Bender,Halt. Who goes there?,387
4229,Fry,Don't point that at me.,387
4230,Bender,"""Fry"" who?",387
4231,Fry,"Look, I know Flexo's your friend but I don't trust him alone with the atom.",387
4232,Bender,"My God, Fry! Just 'cause the guy's got a beard you label him as evil? Well I got a label for you, pal",387
4233,Fry,I'm not prejudiced.,387
4234,Bender,"Ah, save it for the cross-burning, Adolf!",387
4235,Flexo,Keeping an eye on the safe?,387
4236,Bender,You know it!,387
4237,Flexo,"Well, looks like it's my shift. You lie down and go offline for a while.",387
4238,Bender,Alright.,387
4239,Fry,Caught you!  I saw you looking at the atom!,387
4240,Flexo,So? I look at lots of atoms. Shouldn't you be resting up for your shift?,387
4241,Fry,"Oh-ho, you'd like it if I went to sleep, wouldn't you?",387
4242,Flexo,"Whatever it takes to shut your yapper.  Nah, I'm just kidding, you're a joker.",387
4243,Fry,"Yeah, well here's a funny joke",387
4244,Flexo,"Suit yourself, skinbag.",387
4245,Fry,That I will.,387
4246,Flexo,Good.,387
4247,Fry,Good.,387
4248,Flexo,Good.,387
4249,Fry,Good.,387
4250,Flexo,Good.,387
4251,Fry,Good.  Good.,387
4252,Fry,"Well, that's eight hours.",387
4253,Flexo,"Yeah, eight hours of solid boredom.  Nah, I'm kidding, you're a wonderful man.",387
4254,Fry,"Finally, the atom is safe.",387
4255,Leela,What is it?  My God! Did you hear maracas?,389
4256,Fry,No.,389
4257,Leela,"Then it wasn't space bandidos.  Bender, lock down the ship. Don't let Flexo escape.",389
4258,Bender,"Aye aye, Captain. It appears that Flexo has outwitted us all. Especially me ... Bender.",389
4259,Leela,How could Flexo have stolen the atom?,389
4260,Fry,"He must have used a sleep-ray on me. Sleep-rays exist in the future, right?",389
4261,Leela,No.,389
4262,Fry,Oh. Then I must've fallen asleep.,389
4263,Leela,Well you were sure right about Flexo being evil.,389
4264,Bender,I locked down the exits but he may have already gotten away.,389
4265,Leela,"OK, thanks, Bender. Let's fan out and look for him.",389
4266,Bender,"Roger that, I got a map of the ship right here.",389
4267,Leela,Keep an eye on Fry. We can't rule out the possibility that he did it.,389
4268,Leela,Aha!,390
4269,Fry,"Aha!  Uh, searching ... hmm.",391
4270,Leela,Fry? Why are you looking for Flexo in my underpants drawer?,391
4271,Fry,I didn't find him here 10 minutes ago so I thought it was time to check again.,391
4272,Bender,"Well, he wasn't in the, uh, kitchen room.",391
4273,Fry,"Say, Bender, can I hold that map for a second?",391
4274,Bender,And leave me high and dry in case of a scavenger hunt? I think not.,391
4275,Fry,Give it up!,391
4276,Bender,"Alright, take it. Sheesh!",391
4277,Leela,"Well, looks like Flexo got away clean.",392
4278,Bender,It's a darn shame.,392
4279,Leela,He must have jumped ship with the atom the second we landed.,392
4280,Fry,"Or maybe, he never left at all!  Wait a minute. You're Bender.",392
4281,Bender,"Of course, who said I wasn't?",392
4282,Fry,But why were you wearing that scarf and the turtleneck and this fruity number?,392
4283,Bender,"It's a little thing called ""style"". Look it up sometime.",392
4284,Barker,"Our ninth finalist, Miss Methane Planet, Halatina Smogmeyer.  And our tenth and final finalist, Miss Earth's Moon, The Crushinator.",394

4286,Barker,Which one of these lovely womanoids will take home the atomic tiara?,394
4287,Leela,Downplay the tiara.,394
4288,Barker,"Uh, we'll find out after these subliminal messages.",394
4289,Barker,"So you lost the atom, huh? You're garbage, human garbage! Do you brain-dead space jockeys have any idea how much that thing is worth?",395
4290,Fry,"100,000?",395
4291,Leela,"200,000?",395
4292,Bender,"200,001?",395
4293,Barker,You're closest without going over.,395
4294,Fry,"Well, uh, we'll be leaving now. If you'll just sign this form saying you received the atom.",395
4295,Barker,I'm not signing squat. You find me that damn tiara before the pageant ends.,395
4296,Leela,"But, Mr. Barker--",395
4297,Barker,"Enough out of you. I may be against the fur industry, but that won't stop me from skinning you alive! As long as no one wears the skin.",395
4298,Leela,"Well, gentlemen, it appears we're boned.",395

4312,Fry,Bender? You stole the atom?,395
4313,Bender,"Yeah, but I can explain, it's very valuable.",395
4314,Flexo,I saw him snatch it while Fry was asleep. That's why I ran to tell Bob Barker.,395
4315,Fry,"Whoa, whoa, wait a second. You mean Bender is the evil Bender? I am shocked. Shocked! Well not that shocked.",395
4316,Leela,"I'm sorry we suspected you, Flexo. It's just, what with the beard and all--",395
4317,Flexo,"Don't even bother. You people sicken me. I put my life on the line to guard that atom and this is how you repay me? Well you can go rot for all I care.  Nah, I'm just kidding, you guys are alright.",395
4318,Fry,I'm so confused. The Bender I liked turn out to be evil and the Bender I hated was good. How can I live my life when I can't tell good from evil?,395
4319,Bender,"Eh, they're both fine choices. Whatever floats your boat.",395
4320,URL,Is this the guy?,396
4321,Barker,"Huh? Oh, yeah, that looks like him. Whatever.",396

4409,Bender,"Congratulations, Fry, you snagged the perfect girlfriend. Amy's rich, she's probably got other characteristics.",406
4410,Leela,Bender! Romance isn't about money.,406
4411,Bender,"Oh, so it's just coincidence that Zoidberg here is desperately poor and miserably lonely? Puh-lease!",406
4412,Leela,"For your information, it's because he's hideous.",406
4413,Hermes,Well I think Amy and Fry go together like a lime and coconut.,406
4414,Farnsworth,Do I hear wedding bells?,406
4415,Fry,What? No!,406
4416,Farnsworth,"Really? Oh, dear.",406
4417,Zoidberg,You're both very lucky. I'd pay anything to end my miserable loneliness. If only I weren't so desperately poor.,406
4418,Bender,Wait. You mean people will pay good money for romance? Hmm. I think I have a scheme so deviously clever that I--,406
4419,Judge,$500 and time served.,407
4420,Bender,"Stupid anti-pimping laws!  Well, pay the man!",407
4421,Hookerbot,"Bender, honey, we love you!",407
4422,Bender,"Shut up, baby, I know it!",407
4423,Bender,"Ah, computer dating. It's like pimping but you rarely have to use the phrase ""upside your head"".",408
4424,Leela,"Bender, this is stupid. Why would anyone come to you for romantic help?",408
4425,Bender,Hey! Don't make me go upside your head!,408
4426,Hermes,Fry! Amy! Put your pants back on! I need a stapler.,409
4427,Zoidberg,Stop! Stop! If you interrupt the mating dance the male will become enraged and maul us with his fearsome gonad.,409
4428,Fry,"Wait, why aren't we making out?",409
4429,Amy,I 'unno.,409
4430,Bender,"OK, Mister...?",410
4431,Zapp,"Uh, Smith! Zapp Smith. Uh, Brannigan.",410
4432,Bender,Just check off the things you're looking for in a love partner.,410
4433,Zapp,"Let's see ... Oh, yes!  Mmm, I'll just have everything on the menu.",410
4434,Bender,Now to run it through our high-speed romance-a-logical data-fier.  Say hello to Miss Right!,410
4435,Zapp,Hello!,410
4436,Fry,Wow! We're great kissers!,411
4437,Amy,"Yeah! Hey, later, you wanna drive out to Europa? We could have a picnic and spit watermelon seeds at Jupiter.",411
4438,Fry,"Hey, yeah! I used to spit at stuff back in the 20th century. Ah, it's cool how we sort of think exactly alike, and junk.",411
4439,Amy,"Yeah. Y'know, Fry, I really like hanging out with you.",411
4440,Fry,"Everything was going great. Then, all of a sudden, she's talking about hanging out. Hanging out? She's getting way too serious. I'm not a one woman man, Leela.",412
4441,Leela,You'll be back to zero soon enough.,412
4442,Fry,Don't you get it? She's smothering me.,412
4443,Amy,Hi.,412
4444,Fry,You see? You see? Now she's bothering me when I'm at work.,412
4445,Leela,Fry--,412
4446,Fry,"I'm doing my job, there's Amy; I spend a few hours selecting a candy from the machine, there's Amy; I wake up the morning after sleeping with Amy, there's Amy!",412
4447,Leela,I think you're over reacting.,412
4448,Fry,"Am I?  I mean, I'm pulling down delivery boy money.",412
4449,Leela,"Fry, she's pulling down billionaire trust-fund money.",412
4450,Fry,"Then she wants me as a trophy husband. Leela, you gotta come to Europa with us. I can't be alone with her.",412
4451,Amy,"So, ready for a secluded picnic with just you and me?",412
4452,Fry,"Hey, you know who loves secluded picnics with just you and me?  Uh, Dr. Zoidberg.",412
4453,Zoidberg,Did someone say something about a free hot meal?,412
4454,[Scene,"Amy, Fry and Zoidberg listen to Scruffy the Cat's",413
4455,Zoidberg,"Mmm, I haven't eaten since Tuesday! Bird eggs, animal slices ...  All gone! Can I drive?",413
4456,Amy,"No. So, Fry, you busy tomorrow? I got two tickets to the big ape fight.",413
4457,Fry,"Jeez, we're already planning to spend Valentine's Day together. Isn't that enough?",413
4458,Amy,"OK, sure. What do you wanna do for Valentine's Day?",413
4459,Fry,"Oh, so all of a sudden we're spending Valentine's Day together?",413
4460,Amy,But you just said--,413
4461,Fry,"That's it, Amy, we have to talk. Zoidberg, you drive.",413
4462,Zoidberg,Wahoo!,413
4463,Fry,"Pardon me, excuse me.",413
4464,Zoidberg,"Ah, I'll just turn the wheel to maximum fastness!",413
4465,Fry,"Amy, you know how at first you like chocolate but then you start to get tired of it because it always wants to hang out with you?",413
4466,Amy,Huh? You don't like chocolate?,413
4467,Fry,"Look, could chocolate just let me finish?",413
4468,Zoidberg,"Vroom, vroom! And the winner of the big car race is ... Hot Rod Zoidberg!",413
4469,Fry,"Amy, what I'm trying to say is, I think maybe you and I should stop--",413
4470,Zoidberg,"Uh-oh. Here, you drive!",413
4471,Zoidberg,Fry? Are you alright?,414
4472,Fry,Ow! My head is killing me. What happened? Was anybody hurt?,414
4473,Zoidberg,"No, no, no, no, no, of course not. Nobody but you. I'm afraid your body was badly damaged in the crash.",414
4474,Fry,How badly?,414
4475,Zoidberg,"That's it over there.  Don't worry, I managed to keep your head alive with some quick surgery.",414
4476,Fry,Where is it?,414
4477,Zoidberg,There.,414
4478,Amy,"Looks like we'll be spending a lot more time together, Fry!",414
4479,Leela,This sort of thing always happens with office romances.,415
4480,Zoidberg,"Don't worry, Fry, we'll have your body all fixed up in a few days.  Upsy daisy!",415
4481,Fry,"Well, Amy, I'll try not to interfere with your life too much.",415
4482,Amy,Fry!,415
4483,Fry,"Ooh, sorry. I guess I control that arm.",415
4484,Amy,"So, what was it you wanted to talk about before we crashed anyway?",415
4485,Fry,"Oh, that.  I'll meet you in the closet.",415
4486,Fry,"Amy, I really like you, as a friend. But I think we're spending too much time together.",416
4487,Amy,You're breaking up with me?,416
4488,Fry,I just think we should start seeing other people.,416
4489,Amy,"But, I was really having fun.  If that's how you feel.",416
4490,Fry,"I'm sorry, but it is.",416
4491,Amy,"Well, whatever. Hey, listen, as long as we're not seeing each other, you mind if I ask someone else out for Valentine's Day?",416
4492,Fry,Huh?,416
4493,Amy,"I mean, unless it would make you feel bad, being a third wheel.",416
4494,Fry,"Hey, I can get a date too. Now that I'm single, I'll attract all sorts of women!",416
4495,Amy,With my body I think you might only attract one sort of woman.,416
4496,Fry,Oh!,416
4497,Leela,"So, how's business?",417
4498,Bender,"Are you familiar with my friend Al Gore? I'm tellin' you, losers get really desperate around Valentine's Day.",417
4499,Leela,"Yeah, it's pathetic alright!  How much?",417
4500,Bender,500 bucks.,417
4501,Leela,Done.,417
4502,Bender,Zapp Brannigan OK?,417
4503,Leela,No!,417
4504,Bender,600.,417
4505,Fry,"Oh, hey, Leela, uh, can I talk to you for a minute?  In private?",417
4506,Amy,"Oh, no problem.",417
4507,Fry,"This is an emergency. Amy made Valentine's plans with some goon and I'm gonna be stuck there, lonely and miserable. Will you be my date, please?",417
4508,Leela,"You're too late, Fry. I'm sharing Valentine's Day with a very special man. He's not Zapp Brannigan or anything!",417
4509,Fry,Then I have no choice but to do something so pitiful and embarrassing that I'm ashamed to tell you about it.,417
4510,Leela,Bender's in his office.,417
4511,Fry,Thanks.,417
4512,Bender,"I got your hook-up, Fry. Now, my usual fee's 500 bucks, but seeing as how it's you, I'll need it in advance.",418
4513,Amy,"OK, Fry, we're done putting on the bra.",419
4514,Fry,Why exactly did you shave your legs anyway? Are you expecting something to happen with your Valentine's date?,419
4515,Amy,What business is it of yours?,419
4516,Fry,And another thing,419
4517,Amy,This is deodorant.,419
4518,Fry,What does it do?,419
4519,Amy,"C'mon in, Gary! I'll just be another 20 minutes.",419
4520,Gary,I'll be waiting.,419
4521,Fry,20 minutes? You're practically ready now!,419
4522,Amy,"Yeah, but it's good to make them wait a little.",419
4523,Fry,"Oh, God, it's true!",419
4524,Gary,That dress looks great on you.,420
4525,Amy,Thanks.,420
4526,Fry,Where is she?,420
4527,Gary,"I must say, Amy, you're all made up, just like Fry's date. Get it?",420
4528,Amy,Mm-mm.,420
4529,Fry,I've got a date. She'll be along any minute.,420
4530,Bender,"Fry, look who I found! It's Petunia, your dream girl!",420
4531,Petunia,How's them eats?,420
4532,Fry,Uh--,420
4533,Petunia,Don't mind if I do.  Kids'll be hungry.,420
4534,Fry,She seems a little old for me.,420
4535,Bender,She is well-travelled. And I don't mean she travels a lot!,420
4536,Petunia,Wheels fell off my house.,420
4537,Bender,Now how about a rose for the lady? Five bucks a pop!,420
4538,Gary,I'll take one.,420
4539,Fry,"Oh, yeah? Well I want one too.",420
4540,Bender,Eight bucks.,420
4541,Fry,But you just said--,420
4542,Bender,Demand suddenly skyrocketed. You all saw it!,420
4543,Bender,"Leela, meet your future husband Sal.",420
4544,Sal,"Nice eyeball, eyeball.",420
4545,Leela,"Nice ass, ass.",420
4546,Bender,"Ooh, sparks!  Buy her a rose, I guarantee she'll put out!",420
4547,Sal,"Eh, I'll take my chances.",420
4548,Zapp,Cheers!,420
4549,"""Woman""",Cheers!,420
4550,Petunia,So tell me about your prospects. You a good gambler?,420
4551,Fry,"Well, ma'am, I--",420
4552,Petunia,What's your game? Bingo? Keno? Wait a minute! You don't have your own body.,420
4553,Fry,"No, but I control this arm.",420
4554,Petunia,"Slots player, huh? Sorry, but I think I can do better.",420
4555,Fry,"Wait, come back, uh, darling.",420
4556,Petunia,"Can't, hon', I gotta catch my bus back to Nutley. I'd kiss you goodnight but I lost my teeth pulling out a stump.",420
4557,Sal,"So anyways, Leela, I'd love to take a whack at ya but that 10",420
4558,Petunia,"Excuse me, did you say ""10",420
4559,Sal,"Why, yes I dids.",420
4560,Leela,Bender! Did you just round up our dates at the bus station?,420
4561,Bender,Of course not.,420
4562,Sal,Anybodys else for Nutley?,420
4563,Zapp,"Baby, wait! You didn't show me your surprise.",420
4564,Gary,You know what I'd like to do...?,420
4565,Fry,"Oh, jeez, get a room!",420
4566,Gary,Maybe later.,420
4567,Fry,"Hey, I have an idea",420
4568,Gary,"Actually, I thought Amy might like to come back to my place for coffee.",420
4569,Amy,I don't really like coffee.,420
4570,Gary,Neither do I.,420
4571,Amy,"Ooh, I feel a little tipsy!",420
4572,Gary,Let me pick up the check.,420
4573,Fry,Nooo!  Ooh! Ow!,420
4574,Leela,"Why, if it isn't my favourite head on Amy's body",420
4575,Fry,"Oh, Leela!",420
4576,Amy,We were just on our way out.,420
4577,Leela,"Nonsense, the evening's young. So, Gary, what do you do for a living?",420
4578,Gary,I'm a banking industry regulator.,420
4579,Leela,"Really? Y'know, I heard that banking industry regulations are really very simple.",420
4580,Gary,"Oh, no, that's not true. You see, modern banking regulations are a product of five different regulatory traditions. Six if you wanna get technical.",420
4581,Leela,"Oh, I do.",420
4582,Gary,It all began in 1410 when a number of noblemen convened...,420
4583,Fry,Thank you.,420
4584,Zoidberg,"There you are, good as new. Except for your dorsal fin. I'm afraid I couldn't find it after the crash.",421
4585,Fry,Can I live without it?,421
4586,Zoidberg,If you call that living.,421
4587,Farnsworth,I still don't understand why you wouldn't let me graft a laser cannon onto your chest. To crush those who disobey you.  But I guess we're just two different people.,421
4588,Fry,"So, uh, thanks for the ride, Amy. And I hope there are no hard feelings about your date, or stuff.",421
4589,Amy,"It's OK, I had fun. And if I ever feel lonely I can just look over at this disfiguring scar and think of you.",421
4590,Fry,"Well, anyway, it's nice to have my own body back.",421
4591,Leela,So how's the old corpse? Everything hooked up OK?,421
4592,Fry,"Seems to be. My neck's just a little tender.  Ow! Listen, Leela. Thanks for rescuing me last night.",421
4593,Leela,Anytime. I actually enjoyed hanging out with you.,421
4594,Bender,"Yep, everything worked out great thanks to good old Bender.",421
4595,Leela,Come on! It's not like you intentionally set us up with bad dates so we'd spend Valentine's Day together.,421
4596,Bender,"Didn't I, Leela? Didn't I?",421
4597,Leela,No! You didn't! You just corralled a bunch of stiffs at the bus station and pocketed our money!,421
4598,Bender,"True. But in the end, isn't that what Valentine's Day is really all about?",421
4599,Leela,Yeah.,421
4600,Fry,I guess so.  Watch the neck! Watch the neck!,421
4601,Bender,My ass! My beautiful ass!,421
4602,Farnsworth,"Good news, everyone. I've taught the toaster to feel love.  And Hermes returns from his vacation today.",422
4603,Hermes,"Good morning, people.",422
4604,Fry,"Hey, Hermes!",422
4605,Zoidberg,Hello!,422
4606,Leela,Good to see you.,422
4607,Farnsworth,Yo!,422
4608,Bender,My man!,422
4609,Amy,So how was the Spleef Nebula?,422
4610,Hermes,The flight had a stopover on the Brain Slug Planet. Hermes liked it so much he decided to stay of his own free will.,422
4611,Fry,Hermes has all the fun. Wait a second! He's got a Brain Slug on his head!,422
4612,Leela,Shh! You're gonna get us all assimilated!,422
4613,Amy,Just act normal and switch to a garlic shampoo.,422
4614,Hermes,On to new business. Today's mission is for all of you to go to the Brain Slug Planet.,422
4615,Zoidberg,What are we going to do there?,422
4616,Hermes,Just walk around not wearing a helmet.,422
4617,Farnsworth,"Sounds great, Hermes! Whatever you say.  Let's ditch him and go to the movies!",422
4618,Fry,"Hey, yeah!",422
4619,Zoidberg,I'm seeing a movie with friends!,422
4620,[Scene,Outside Loew's Aleph-0 Plex. Some of the movies showing are,423
4621,Fry,Cool! Let's see this one!,423
4622,Leela,"Nah. I'm not in the mood for a historical documentary. I've heard good things about Quizblorg, Quizblorg.",423
4623,Amy,Guk! I hate subtitles. Alien films are so pretentious.,423
4624,Zoidberg,Fellows! Fellows! How about a film we can all enjoy? Planet Of The Clams.  It's about an upside-down world where lobster is slave to clam.,423
4625,Bender,Who invited you? Let's just see All My Circuits,423
4626,All My Circuits,The Movie,423
4627,Fry,"Yeah, I wanna see that.",423
4628,Bender,"Good point, Bender.",423
4629,Fry,I'll take a small Slurm.,424
4630,Refreshment-bot,"For only 25 cents less, you can get a super-small.",424
4631,Fry,"Uh, OK.  Oh, man!",424
4632,Bender,"Hey, gimme a large diet malt liquor and a popcorn with extra motor oil.",424
4633,Farnsworth,Down in front!,425
4634,Announcer,Glagnar's Human Rinds presents,425
4635,Fry,"Ooh, this is real futuristic!",425
4636,Crow T. Robot,Shh! Don't talk during the movie.,425
4637,Announcer,"And in the world of Ultimate Robot Fighting, the Masked Unit wins his championship bout against Gorgeous Gonks by technical melting.",425

4639,Robot,"I'm sorry, sir, but I need it to watch the movie.",425
4640,Bender,Just ask Flabby over here to describe it to you later.,425
4641,Robot,"Sir, she is as the factory made her.",425
4642,Bender,Well they should have stopped making her about halfway through.,425
4643,Fembot,Whee!,425
4644,Calculon,Calculon Enterprises.,425
4645,Monique,"Calculon, a fight scene has broken out at the special effects warehouse. Come quickly before a fiery explosion chases someone down a hallway.",425

4648,Mr. Moviefone,You have pressed 2.,425
4649,Fry,"No, I didn't!",425
4650,Mr. Moviefone,I'm almost positive you did.,425
4651,Calculon,"Add in the carryover from form 16A, then deduct line 2B...",425
4652,Robot,"Pardon me, sir, but you seem to be inadvertently kicking my seat.",425
4653,Bender,"""Pardon me, sir, but you seem to be bleh, bleh...""",425
4654,Robot,"Yes, that's the gist of what I said. Would you mind?",425
4655,Bender,"Sure thing, pal.",425
4656,Robot,"Uh, sir?",425
4657,Bender,Who threw that?,425
4658,Robot,"That's it! Sir, I challenge you to fisticuffs!",425
4659,Bender,"Oh, I'm boned.",425
4660,Hattie,Let's all go to the lobby!,425
4661,Robot,I'm gonna open a file of whup-ass on you!,425
4662,Leela,"Bender, do you know who that was?",425
4663,Man #1,Cripes! The Masked Unit! You knocked him out cold.,425
4664,Man #2,I'm impressed.,425
4665,Doubledeal,"Son, I'm the commissioner of Ultimate Robot Fighting. I'm a connoisseur of jerks like you who pick fights in movie theatres and you're the biggest I've ever seen.",425
4666,Bender,You should see me at funerals.,425
4667,Doubledeal,"Kid, I want you in the Ultimate Robot Fighting League.",425
4668,Bender,Ultimate Robot Fighting? Sounds pleasant! I'll do it.,425

4670,Farnsworth,Aw. They don't make movies like this anymore.,425
4671,Bender,"I'm gonna be the greatest Ultimate Robot Fighter ever. Float like a floatbot, sting like an automatic stinging machine!",426
4672,Amy,"Bender, you can't be an Ultimate Robot Fighter. It's the most brutal form of competition in the galaxy!",426
4673,Bender,It is?,426
4674,Farnsworth,"There are no rules. Two robots enter, one robot leaves. Then later the other robot leaves after being declared the winner.",426
4675,Bender,"Well, that doesn't sound so bad.",426
4676,Farnsworth,"Oh, did I mention the crippling, agonising pain? I'm pretty sure I did. Oh, yes, definitely.",426
4677,Bender,Crippling pain? That's not covered by my insurance fraud! Count me out.,426
4678,Leela,No! You've got to do it. I don't care how suicidal it is.,426
4679,Fry,Hey! How come when I wanna do fun stuff that'll kill me you're against it?,426
4680,Leela,"This is more important than that marble-eating contest, Fry! It's about pride. Let me tell you a story from my childhood.",426
4681,Zoidberg,"Oh, again with the orphanarium!",426
4682,Leela,"When I was growing up at the orphanarium, I got picked on a lot.",426
4683,Leela,My only outlet was Arcturan Kung Fu.,426
4684,Fnog,"Excellent. Bill, Keith, you will go to Junior Championships. Bill, congratulate Keith when he regains consciousness.",426
4685,Leela,"But, Master Fnog, I can beat these dorks with one eye closed.",426
4686,Fnog,Perhaps. But there is more to winning than beating your opponent. You lack the will of the warrior.,426
4687,Leela,What do you mean? Watch this!,426
4688,Bill,Ow!,426
4689,Fnog,"No girl has the will of a warrior. You have the will of a housewife or, at best, the schoolmarm.",426
4690,Leela,That's it. I'll take you on right now.,426
4691,Fnog,"Very well. But, you see, I have the will of the warrior. Therefore, the battle is already over. The winner? Me!  Rematch? You lose again! Had enough? I thought so!",426
4692,Leela,I lost my chance to be a champion. I won't let you throw away yours.,426
4693,Bender,Leela's right! I don't wanna end up a loser like her. Count me back in!,426
4694,Leela,Let's see what you got. Touch your toes.,427
4695,Bender,Still ... can't ... reach!,427
4696,Bender,Let's commence preparations for rumbling!,427
4697,Referee,"Ladies and gentlemen and smizmars, welcome to tonight's main event. In this corner, from Mom's Friendly Robot Factory in America's heartland, Mexico",428
4698,Fry,Bender rules!,428
4699,Hermes,I got you an official Bender hat.,428
4700,Fry,"Wow! Thanks, Hermes!  I-- Hey! Cut that out!",428
4701,Bender,You can't hit what you can't see!,428
4702,Leela,"Get up, Bender. You can't quit every time you get an axe in the back.  Or a drill through your face. Now quit scratching your axe-hole and get out there.",428
4703,Bender,Huh?,428
4704,Referee,And the winner is ... Bender!,428
4705,Doubledeal,"Nice work out there, kid.",429
4706,Bender,"Y'know, I think I he might be dead. I took a life!",429
4707,Clearcutter,"Hi, boss. Yo, dude!",429
4708,Bender,"Hey, he's not dead. What's up with that?",429
4709,Doubledeal,"What, you didn't read the pamphlet? Ultimate Robot Fighting's a scam, kid. It's rigged.  It's a secret, so keep it under your head, but the most popular robot always wins.",429
4710,Bender,You mean I'm not a great fighter? I just won 'cause I'm popular?,429
4711,Doubledeal,Bingo!,429
4712,Bender,Woo-hoo! I'm popular!,429
4713,Doubledeal,"In fact, you're more than popular, you're pure lowest common denominator.",429
4714,Bender,Go Bender! Go Bender! Go Bender!,429
4715,Referee,Presenting Bender the Offender!,430
4716,Bender,I'm just an ex-con trying to go straight and get my kids back.,430
4717,Referee,Versus ... Billionairebot!,430
4718,Referee,Versus,430
4719,Foreigner,I'm not from here! I have my own customs! Look at my crazy passport!,430
4720,Referee,Versus ... The Chain Smoker!,430
4721,Chain Smoker,I love smoking. And after I win the fight I'm heading straight to your favourite restaurant.,430
4722,Bender,"You know, I'm also an Ultimate Robot Lover.",431
4723,Leela,Bender! You're three hours late. You can't give up on your training now after both of us worked so hard.,431
4724,Bender,"What do you mean, ""we""?",431
4725,Leela,"I said ""us"".",431
4726,Bender,"Hey, Bender the Offender doesn't need you. Bender the Offender doesn't need anybody!",431
4727,Fembot #1,"What about us, Mr. The Offender?",431
4728,Bender,Well obviously I need floozies! Let's roll!,431
4729,Bender,"Howdy, chief. For my next bout, what do you say I fight these two bimbos in some mud?",432
4730,Doubledeal,"Actually, we've decided to go in a different direction.",432
4731,Bender,What if I told your we wouldn't be fighting in the conventional sense?,432
4732,Doubledeal,"Bender, your popularity is slipping.",432
4733,Foreigner,Sales of your Bender Brand French milk bath soaps are down 20%.,432
4734,Bender,"Those morons! I said pea berry, not sandalwood!",432
4735,Doubledeal,"Damnit, Bender! If you can't move sandalwood, you don't belong in this league! That's why you're gonna lose next week's title match.",432
4736,Bender,But the crowd loves me.,432
4737,Doubledeal,Perhaps. But let's see how they feel about your new persona,432
4738,Billionairebot,You'll be the most unpopular robot fighter since Sergeant Faeces Processor.,432
4739,Bender,"Oh, yeah?  Well what if I don't let the new guy win?",432
4740,Doubledeal,Then he'll just have to beat you the old-fashioned way,432
4741,Destructor,I am Destructor!,432
4742,Bender,See you at the fight.,432
4743,Bender,"So then I said, ""See you at the fight."" And that's the story.",433
4744,Fry,"Man, I thought Ultimate Robot Fighting was real, like pro wrestling. But it turns out it's fixed, like boxing.",433
4745,Bender,"It's one thing to win a fixed fight; there's dignity in that. But to lose? And in this atrocity? I can't do it! Leela, you gotta train me to win.",433
4746,Leela,"No way! If you wouldn't take my help when you didn't need it, why should I give it to you now when you do need it?",433
4747,Farnsworth,What the hell are you talking about?,433
4748,Leela,I don't know. But I'm not helping.,433
4749,Announcer,You loved him as Bender the Offender! Now get ready to hate him as he threatens your sexuality in his new persona ... The Gender Bender!,433
4750,Bender,I'm a real toughie!,433
4751,Announcer,Squaring off this Sunday versus Destructor!,433
4752,Destructor,And stop calling me!,433
4753,Fnog,"I am Destructor's trainer, Master Fnog. My pupil will be victorious for he has the will of a warrior!",433
4754,Leela,"Not Fnog! Bender, let's hit the gym. I'm gonna teach you to fight like a girl!",433
4755,Bender,I'll put on my tutu!,433
4756,"""Cosell""","Hello and welcome to a remarkable championship bout. Destructor, a robotic armoured tank, whose very use at battle has been ruled a war crime, versus Gender Bender, who wears a pink tutu.  This is Rich Little, imitating Howard Cosell, here at ringside with George Foreman. George, a word in edgewise?",434
4757,Foreman,This could be the most one-sided fight since 1973 when Ali faced an 80-foot tall mechanical Joe Frazier. M-My memory's not what it used to be but I think the entire Earth was destroyed.,434
4758,Little,"Interesting, if true. The Vegas odds tonight stand at an unprecedented 1000-0; a bet of $0 on Bender pays $1000 if he wins. Still, very few takers.",434
4759,Foreman,It's not-not a smart bet.,434
4760,Leela,"According to the script, you're supposed to prance out and tickle him with your fairy wand. Instead, I want you to prance out and kick his head off!",434
4761,Bender,"Got it. Large kickle, hold the tickle!",434
4762,Hermes,Thank God I'm free of that nightmare!,434
4763,Bender,"Sorry, buddy. Here you go!",434
4764,Hermes,Thank you. It was cold down there on the floor.,434
4765,Amy,"Here, Professor, I got you a programme.",434
4766,Farnsworth,"Oh, good. Just let me put on my reading glasses.  Why, Zoidberg, there's a lovely photo of you in here.",434
4767,Referee,"In this corner, the confused young robot with the golden curls. Weighing 525lbs",434
4768,Zapp,Boo!,434
4769,Nixon,Get that hippie out of the ring!,434
4770,Referee,"And in these two corners, weighing 400 tons, the gizmo from Pismo ... Beach, Destructor!",434
4771,Fnog,"So, we meet again. Most amusing",434
4772,Leela,"Keep laughing, Fnog!  Ready, Bender?",434
4773,Bender,I was born ready! Gimme the bell!  Now boarding standby passengers--,434
4774,Foreman,"This seems like as good a time as any time to bring up my new grill for no reason.  With its patented design, the fat drains directly into my mouth.",434
4775,Bender,"For God's sakes, Fry!",434
4776,Hermes,That's exactly what I was thinking.,434
4777,Bender,Mommy!,434
4778,Leela,"OK, Fnog, that's enough. Call him off. Fnog?  Hmm.",434
4779,Bender,Why won't anyone help me?,434
4780,Leela,"So, once more we meet again.",434
4781,Fnog,Huh?,434
4782,Leela,"You didn't train Destructor. You're just controlling him like a puppet. I mean, cheating in a fake fight. That's low!",434
4783,Fnog,Better than being a girl. Like you. You're a girl!,434
4784,Leela,"Oh, right. Girls lack the will of the warrior!",434
4785,Bender,Huh? It's bendering time!  Take this. And this!,434
4786,Fnog,You were an excellent student.  Too bad I was a lousy teacher!,434
4787,Bender,"I think you misunderstood the concept of ""bendering time""!",434
4788,Fnog,See you in girl hell. I'll be in boy hell -- much nicer!,434
4789,Leela,Yes!,434
4790,Bender,Yes!  Oh!,434
4791,Referee,And the winner is Destructor!,434
4792,Little,I've not seen a spectacle of this nature in all my years impersonating a sportscaster.,434
4793,Foreman,It sure was some fight. Interesting side note,434
4794,Little,No argument here.,434
4795,Fry,Bender? How did the fight go? I heard somebody got flattened!,434
4796,Amy,"Fry, where's your Brain Slug?",434
4797,Farnsworth,Poor little guy starved to death.,434
4798,Leela,"I'm proud of you, Bender. Sure, you lost. You lost bad. But the important thing is I beat up someone who hurt my feelings in high school.",434
4799,Bender,I'm in tremendous pain here.,434
4800,Doubledeal,"Great job, kid. You lost and you made it look almost half real. I want you to have this card good for 10% off at Bed Bath & Beyond.",434
4801,Bender,Yes! I'm the greatest! The greatest!,434
4802,Little,And so ends the chronicle of one of the greatest ever to play the sport.,434
4803,Foreman,And he didn't look half bad in the tutu.,434
4804,Little,That he did surely not.,434
4805,Foreman,What?,434
4806,Farnsworth,"Good news, everyone! Several years ago I tried to log on to AOL, and it just went through. Whee! We're online!",435
4807,Farnsworth,"Go ahead, get into these net suits. I designed and tested them myself.",436
4808,Leela,They smell like burning Rhesus Monkey.,436
4809,Farnsworth,Really? I guess when you're around it all day you stop noticing. Off you go.,436
4810,Fry,Hey!,436
4811,Bender,Behold,436
4812,[Cut to,Internet Browser. The crew stand on a,436
4813,Fry,My God! It's full of ads!,436
4814,Leela,Follow me!,436
4815,Fry,It's immense.,436
4816,Leela,It's got every piece of information anyone could ever want.,436
4817,Fry,So I see!,436
4818,Zoidberg,What? What's going on here?,436
4819,Amy,"Hey, that's me!",436
4820,Bender,"No, it isn't. I just took some pictures of your face and stuck them on someone else's body.",436
4821,Leela,Hey!,436
4822,Doorman,Are you over 18?,437
4823,Young Boy,Yes.,437
4824,Younger Boy,Yes.,437
4825,Bender,"I'm telling you, Fry, they've got a chatroom for everybody. And here it is.",438
4826,Amy,"Ew, that is so gross!",438
4827,Leela,"Yeah. I'll stick with this one, thank you.",438
4828,Amy,Yeah.,438
4829,Bender,"Hi, I'm a naughty nurse and I really need someone to talk to. $9.95 a minute.",439
4830,Man,"Ooh, you're a dollar naughtier than most.",439
4831,Bender,So how 'bout them Knicks?,439
4832,Nerd #1,Hello? Are there any girls in this room at all?,440
4833,Nerd #2,"Yeah, bring on the hot chicks 'cause I'm a hot stud.",440
4834,Nerd #3,Yeah! So are we!,440
4835,Leela,"I'm a woman, if that's what you mean.  I don't like to play games, so I'll just say I'm a cyclops, I'm a spaceship captain, I'm the only one of my species and I'm interested in meeting a man.",440
4836,Nerd #4,A woman! I'm scared.,440
4837,Fry,"Well, thanks to the Internet, I'm bored with sex. Is there a place on the web that panders to my lust for violence?",441
4838,Bender,Is the Space Pope reptilian?,441
4839,Hermes,"Get ready for fun, Fry. Nowadays, we have a type of game played entirely on video.",442
4840,Leela,"We call it a ""video game"".",442
4841,Fry,"Uh, ""video game"" you say? Well, golly gee, you mighty spacemen of the future will have to show me how it works.",442
4842,Zoidberg,The doctor is in!  The doctor is out!,443
4843,Holo-Farnsworth,"Everyone, please sign off. We have a delivery. Plus I have to use the phone--  Leela, please tell the others that--",443
4844,Leela,Who are you?,443
4845,Cyclops,I saw you in the chat room but you left before I had a chance to talk to you. After all these years of searching for another Cyclops.,443
4846,Leela,I can't believe it. I've dreamed of this moment all my life.,443
4847,Cyclops,Do you think perhaps you and I--,443
4848,Leela,"Fry, you idiot. Ever since I was abandoned on Earth I've been searching for who my people are and where they come from. Then I finally meet another Cyclops and you blast him. You wrecked my one chance to learn who I am!",443
4849,Fry,"Oh, Leela, I feel terrible. If there's anything I can ever do--  I won! I'm the greatest!",443
4850,Leela,Come on. We have work to do.,443
4851,Fry,Are you still mad at me for wrecking your once-in-a-lifetime chance to learn the meaning of your existence?,444
4852,Leela,"No, I'm just happy you were able to win a video game. Now let's concentrate on getting this desperately-needed popcorn to the people of Cineplex 14, OK?",444
4853,Operator,It's not spam.,444
4854,Leela,Huh?  It's him!,444
4855,Cyclops,To Leela. Subject,444
4856,Fry,Kicked your ass!,444
4857,Alcazar,"Leela, we have much to discuss. Please come join me on the planet of your birth. Co-ordinates follow.",444
4858,Fry,"Well, too bad we gotta make that urgent popcorn delivery.",444
4859,Leela,It'll get there.,444
4860,Leela,"After a whole life of searching, I may finally have found where I belong.",446
4861,Bender,Too bad it's a dump.,446
4862,Leela,Look at that statue. It's only got one eye.,446
4863,Fry,Lazy sculptor!,446
4864,Alcazar,"Welcome home, Leela.",446
4865,Leela,Alcazar?  Are you real? Or am I seeing single?,446
4866,Alcazar,Ow! Of course I'm real.,446
4867,Leela,"After all this time, somebody else with one eye who isn't a clumsy carpenter or, uh, a kid with a BB gun.",446
4868,Alcazar,"It's alright, Leela. You'll never be alone again.  Come, let me introduce you to yourself. Do you mind if your servants walk?",446
4869,Leela,Not at all!,446
4870,Alcazar,"We are the last remaining Cyclopses. Our planet is Cyclopia. This is the capital, Cyclops City. Stop me if I'm going too fast for you.",446
4871,Leela,There's so much information and yet somehow I feel as if I know it all already.,446
4872,Alcazar,This sacred mosaic depicts our goddess of beauty.,446
4873,Fry,"Hmm, you got any sacred artwork of her from the back?",446
4874,Alcazar,"Her perfect eye reminds me of yours, Leela. Had our race survived, you would have been a temple priestess or a supermodel.",446
4875,Leela,"Oh, please! Really?",446
4876,Alcazar,"And there's the infamous pirate, Purple Beard, scourge of the six seas.",446
4877,Fry,What's over that hill?,446
4878,Alcazar,The Forbidden Valley. A holy sanctuary where no one may tread.,446
4879,Fry,Is that anything like a cemetery 'cause I gotta take a leak.  Ow!,446
4880,Leela,"Fry, that's offensive to our people.  Isn't it?",446
4881,Fry,Ow!,446
4882,Alcazar,This is my home. I hope you don't think less of me because I live in a giant castle.,447
4883,Leela,"Oh, no, not at all. If anything, I'm more impressed.",447
4884,Bender,Ooh! I'm gonna need to make some room.,447
4885,Alcazar,In here is where I dream my lonely dreams and cook my simple meals.,447
4886,Leela,It's all so sad. What happened to our people?,447
4887,Alcazar,"It's too painful to speak of now. Come, I'll show you your quarters.",447
4888,Bender,Ow! Ow! Ow!,447
4889,Leela,I heard you from my room. What's wrong?,448
4890,Alcazar,"Nothing. It's just-- No, Leela. I don't want to see tears in your perfect eye.",448
4891,Leela,"Please, is it about the fate of our people? Because I'm very interested in that.",448
4892,Alcazar,"Well, OK. But it's chilly and you're going to be all wet from the tears. Let's go into my chamber.",448
4893,Alcazar,"Unfortunately, one of the 40 planets hit, was ours.",449
4894,Cyclopian Man #1,How far away do you think it is?,449
4895,Cyclopian Man #2,A trillion miles?,449
4896,Alcazar,"Things got hot. You look a little hot, actually. You can take off that jacket.  Our people don't like to be hot. Anyway, just before the impact...",449
4897,Alcazar,Our smartest scientists managed to save one baby.,449
4898,Leela,"Alcazar, I used to be a baby, it might have been me!",449
4899,Alcazar,"Fortunately, I was employed as a pool cleaner at the time and, when I emerged from retrieving a dead possum, I found I was the only one left.",449
4900,Leela,It's so tragic.,449
4901,Alcazar,"Yes, but the real tragedy is that our race ends with us.",449
4902,Leela,It doesn't have to.,449
4903,Alcazar,What do you mean?,449
4904,Leela,You're a male and I'm a female.,449
4905,Alcazar,I'm still not following you.,449
4906,Leela,"Wake up, my king.",449
4907,Alcazar,"Oh, jeez, what a night. Make me some coffee, would you.",449
4908,Leela,"Uh, sure, OK. What do you take with that?",449
4909,Alcazar,"Pancakes and sausage. Kitchen's in the basement, pans are in the attic.",449
4910,Leela,Maybe after breakfast we can talk about rebuilding our civilisation.,449
4911,Fry,"Mmm! Great pancakes, Leela.",450
4912,Alcazar,"Yeah, they'll come in handy if I need to cover any tiny manholes.  Listen, hon', we don't want to look like slobs in front of the other species, do we?",450
4913,Leela,No.,450
4914,Alcazar,So get to work on these dishes. And then organise my collection of naked celebrity photos by name and what you can see.,450
4915,Leela,"Look, Alcazar--",450
4916,Alcazar,Call me Al.,450
4917,Leela,"Look, Al. I know you've been living alone a long time and I can sympathise, but I'm not your maid.",450
4918,Alcazar,"You're right, I'm sorry. I guess the relationship isn't going to work. So much for the Cyclops race. I thought it was a pretty good race but, uh--",450
4919,Leela,"OK, OK, I'll do the dishes.  Hey, where'd they go?",450
4920,Bender,"Ah, Leela's experiencing the greatest joy a woman can feel",451
4921,Fry,He may be some low-life jerk but I don't trust him. I think he's hiding something and I'm gonna find out what it is.,451
4922,Fry,Try and stop me!,452
4923,[Scene,Castle,453
4924,Leela,Al? I did my hair the way you wanted it.  Who are these people?,453
4925,Alcazar,Friends.,453
4926,Leela,"Hey, where'd you get this couch and that TV set and all this stuff?",453
4927,Alcazar,"They were giving it away on the street corner. Just like you, Leela!",453
4928,Leela,Too bad they weren't giving away the three things you actually need,453
4929,Rat Woman,"You go, girl!",453
4930,Alcazar,"By the way, your pal Fry fell into the dungeon. Take him a taco so he doesn't die and stink up the place.",453
4931,Leela,"Come on, Al, can't you let the little guy out?",453
4932,Alcazar,"Jeez, Leela, twice in one day? I'm not Superman!",453
4933,Leela,Why were you sneaking into my people's forbidden valley?,454
4934,Fry,"'Cause I think Alcazar's hiding something from you. Listen, Leela, you may not like it, you may not believe it, you may not wanna hear it but Alcazar's a jerk. He's bad for you. He--",454
4935,Leela,I know.,454
4936,Fry,You do?,454
4937,Leela,"Fry, if it's obvious to you with your learning disability then of course it's obvious to me. He's crude and gross and he treats me like a slave.",454
4938,Fry,Then dump his one-eyed ass.,454
4939,Leela,"I can't. If I leave Alcazar, that's the end of the Cyclops race. And I won't let that happen. Even if it means a lifetime of unhappiness.",454
4940,Alcazar,Leela! Mop up in aisle number two!,454
4941,Leela,I'll break up with him at dinner.,454
4942,Fry,I'll be there.,454
4943,Alcazar,"Yo, Leela, what gives? Pig says your slop tastes like crap.",454
4944,Pig,Yeah. Like crap.,454
4945,Fry,"C'mon, Leela, you deserve better than this guy. Dump him already!",454
4946,Leela,I'm trying.,454
4947,Alcazar,"Hey, everyone, jam a sock in your spit faucets.  Leela, will you marry me?",454
4948,Fry,No! No!,454
4949,Leela,Yes! I will!,454
4950,Rat Woman,They're getting married!,454

4955,Bender,It's a magical day.,455
4956,Fry,Welcome!,455
4957,Fry,"Psst, Leela. You've gotta get me out of here. It's horrible! Eating scraps, letting my waste drop wherever it falls like an animal in the zoo.",456
4958,Leela,Animals go in the corner.,456
4959,Fry,The corner! Why didn't I think of that?,456
4960,Leela,"Look, Fry, I'd like to help you but it's my wedding and I'm kind of busy.  Here. Try to be happy for me. That way at least one of us will be.",456
4961,Fry,That's it! It's time for this bird to walk.,456
4962,Fry,"Bender, come on. We've gotta get some dirt on Alcazar. Let's go and find out what makes the Forbidden Valley so forbidden.",456
4963,Bender,"Uh, no, thanks. I'm good.",456
4964,Fry,But there's probably some cool forbidden stuff you can steal.,456
4965,Bender,"I don't know, Fry. For the first time in my life I feel like I've stolen enough.",456
4966,Fry,"Bender, snap out of it!",456
4967,Bender,"Sorry, I don't know what came over me. Let's go.  I love stealing, I love taking things!",456
4968,[Scene,"Garden. At the wedding, Alcazar yawns. Hermes plays",457

4971,Bender,"Whoa, Mittens!",458
4972,Fry,My God! Four identical castles!,458
4973,Bender,Each more identical than the last!,458

4975,Bender,And here's another one with no eyes.,458
4976,Preacherbot,Does anyone have a reason why this couple shall not be joined in the irrevocable shackles of holy bliss?,459
4977,Farnsworth,Saving a race of one-eyed monsters? Who could object to that?,459
4978,Alcazar,"Cut to the chase, Preach!",459
4979,Preacherbot,"Do you, Alcazar ...  take this woman before you ... to love ... in sickness ... do you part?",459
4980,Alcazar,"Yeah, sure I do. Come on, faster!",459

4986,Five-Eyed Woman,"Alcazar, why you are so late for our wedding? And why you have only one eye?",459
4987,Alcazar,"It ... ooh, uh!  She-- She's nuts. I can morph into a five-eyed alien and I kinda said I'd marry her. But I'm really a Cyclops and I'm really going to marry you.",459
4988,Fry,"Oh, yeah? Then what about this?",459
4989,Alcazar,This is a bit awkward.,459
4990,Five-Eyed Woman,Who's she?,459
4991,Leela,Who's she?,459
4992,Sandy,Who are they?,459
4993,Alcazar,"Go back to the castle, Sandy.",459
4994,Fry,And maybe you'd like to meet her.  And her.,459
4995,Alcazar,"Leela, this must all be very confusing.",459
4996,Leela,A little. That's why I've decided to hurt you until you explain it.,459
4997,Sandy,Show us your real form!,459
4998,Leela,Yeah!,459
4999,Alien #2,Do it!,459
5000,Alcazar,"Well, this is the real me. But I can explain",459
5001,Bender,He's a saint!,459
5002,Leela,But why did you have all five weddings on the same day?,459
5003,Alcazar,"Hey, lady, you got any idea what it costs to rent a tux that changes shape?",459
5004,Leela,"Alright, Alcazar, I just have one last question for you.",459
5005,Alcazar,What's that?,459
5006,Leela,"If you can change form, why didn't you change it in the one place that counts?",459
5007,Leela,"Thanks for saving me from that creep, Fry.",460
5008,Fry,"Hey, that's what I do.",460
5009,Leela,"I guess I was so desperate to find out who I really was, I forgot who I really was.",460
5010,Farnsworth,"No harm done. In the many decades you'll work to repay me for that shipment of popcorn you destroyed, you'll have plenty of time to search for your true home.",460
5011,Leela,"Yeah. I mean, how many planets can there be?",460
5012,Farnsworth,"Good news, everyone! The university is bringing me up on disciplinary charges. Wait, that's not good news at all.",461
5013,Leela,"Whatever you did, Professor, I'm sure there's a reasonable explanation.",461
5014,Farnsworth,"Yes, but they won't listen. Everyone's always in favour of saving Hitler's brain but when you put it in the body of a great white shark, ooh, suddenly you've gone too far.",461
5015,Vernon,"Professor Farnsworth, do you know why we've called you here today?",463
5016,Farnsworth,"Listen to me, you pompous frauds. If I'm going down, I'm taking you all with me. Dean Vernon, I know the truth",463
5017,Vernon,"Actually, Professor, we merely called you here to say...  Surprise!",463
5018,Man #1,Surprise!,463
5019,Man #2,Happy birthday!,463
5020,Hermes,Surprise!,463
5021,Farnsworth,"And you, Coach Smalley, or should I say ""Coach hairpiece""?",463
5022,Leela,"No, Professor! It's a surprise party for your 150th birthday.",463
5023,Farnsworth,Ooh!,463
5024,Bender,"Good evening, I'm--  Whoa, sorry. I'm Bender and I'll be emceeing this roast. Y'know, they say you can judge a man by the company he keeps. So here's the Professor's oldest friend, a grotesque, stinking lobster.",463
5025,Zoidberg,"Good evening, ladies and germs.  Hey, Ringo, that was the joke. Oh, it's Showtime at the Apollo all over again.",463
5026,Bender,"Where would the Professor be without students who love and respect him? Right there!  But seriously, of all the former crew members of the Professor's delivery ship, our next speaker is by far the most alive. Captain Musky?",463
5027,Zoidberg,I wouldn't wanna follow that guy!,463
5028,Bender,"And now, a man who needs no introduction.  Fry, get up there!",463
5029,Fry,Oh.  Roll film!,463
5030,Leela,And before long he blossomed into a greasy teenager.,463
5031,Fry,Dork alert!,463
5032,Leela,"And even as he nears his 150th birthday, the Professor retains the fiery passion of youth.",463
5033,Farnsworth,"Listen, you pompous frauds. If I'm going down, I'm taking you all with me.",463
5034,Bender,"How 'bout a few words, Professor?",463
5035,Farnsworth,"Eh, wha?",463
5036,Bender,"I said ""words"".",463
5037,Farnsworth,"Uh, what a pleasure it is to see my lifetime of accomplishment summed up in a 3-minute film. My best years are behind me. So much left undone. So little time.",463
5038,Bender,"Funny, funny stuff.",463
5039,Farnsworth,My life is over.,464
5040,Leela,"No, it isn't. You have another 10 years left.",464
5041,Fry,Leela! He could live another 100 years!,464
5042,Leela,"No, he couldn't. When you turn 160, robots from the Sunset Squad take you to a mysterious planet and you never return.",464
5043,Fry,"Wow, a whole planet of old people. Where is it?",464
5044,Bender,Nobody knows!,464
5045,Farnsworth,"So many loves half-loved, so many inventions half-invented. That damn time machine alone set me back 15 years.",464
5046,Zoidberg,"If only it'd worked, you could go back and not waste your time on it.",464
5047,Farnsworth,"There's no one to carry on after I'm gone. No one to take care of my work and my research and my fabulous fortune.  By God, that's it! I've got to name a successor.",464
5048,Fry,A successor?,464
5049,Zoidberg,A successor to the Professor?,464
5050,Farnsworth,There's no time to lose. I'm off to my lab to build a successor-naming machine!,464
5051,Fry,"Man, the Professor's been in his lab for days.",465
5052,Bender,I hope he didn't die. Unless he left a note naming me his successor. Then I hope he did die.,465
5053,Zoidberg,You? The successor? Over my empty shell! The Professor will pick me. Only I have his lobster-like tenacity.,465
5054,Hermes,"Up yours, Zoidberg. Up wherever your species traditionally crams things. The only sensible way to choose a successor is with a limbo contest.",465
5055,Leela,What?,465
5056,Hermes,"Kingston rules. Two men go down, one come up.",465
5057,Leela,"Look, the Professor trusts me with a giant spaceship. He wouldn't trust the rest of you with his dentures.",465
5058,Amy,"Yesh, he would.",465
5059,Fry,"Sorry, everyone, but need I remind you? Blood is thicker than water.",465
5060,Zoidberg,Blood ... thicker ... water.,465
5061,Farnsworth,"Everyone, I have a very dramatic announcement. So anyone with a weak heart should leave now. Goodbye.",466
5062,Leela,"Uh, Professor?",466
5063,Farnsworth,"Oh, oh, yes, the announcement! As you all know, I am not long for this world.",466
5064,Leela,"Yes, we know.",466
5065,Hermes,"True, mon.",466
5066,Amy,Buh!,466
5067,Fry,One foot in the grave.,466
5068,Farnsworth,So I've picked my successor. It's someone in whom I have great faith -- even though his mind is undeveloped and he's accomplished nothing.  My closest living relative.,466
5069,Fry,"Oh, yeah!",466
5070,Farnsworth,"My clone, Cubert Farnsworth.",466
5071,Zoidberg,He's horrible!,466
5072,Fry,Crud. Can I at least be in charge of your dentures?,466
5073,Amy,You wish!,466
5074,Fry,Where did Cubert come from?,466
5075,Farnsworth,12 years ago I began the cloning process by removing some skin cells from one of the shapelier growths on my back.,466
5076,Leela,"Wait. If he's your clone, why doesn't his nose look like yours?",466
5077,Farnsworth,I left him in his first tube too long and he got squished up against the side.,466
5078,Bender,Is he dumb or just ugly?,466
5079,Farnsworth,Let's find out.,466
5080,Cubert,What? You've never seen a genius's wiener before?,466
5081,Zoidberg,No.,466
5082,Leela,Never.,466
5083,Fry,"Well, once in the park.",466
5084,Zoidberg,Mmm!,467
5085,Cubert,"As long as I'm going to be in charge here, let me examine my so-called ""crew"", if it can so be called. First of all, Dr. Zoidberg, do you even have a medical degree?",467
5086,Zoidberg,I lost it ... in a volcano.,467
5087,Cubert,And why do we need a bending robot around here anyway? What possible use do we have for you?,467
5088,Bender,Uh ... me no speaka the English.,467
5089,Cubert,And why does our space pilot have only one eye? There's someone I'd like you to meet. His name is depth perception!,467
5090,Leela,"Why, you little--",467
5091,Cubert,"Wow, that hurt -- the air!",467
5092,Bender,Im pending para un bending!,467
5093,Farnsworth,"Oh, Cubert, come in here. I have something amazing to show you.",467
5094,Cubert,What is it? A competent employee? I doubt that very much!,467
5095,Fry,Little twerp.,467
5096,Bender,"Aye, Chihuahua!",467
5097,Farnsworth,"As my successor, I'm trusting you to carry on my work. These are just some of the half-finished inventions you'll spend your life finishing.",468
5098,Cubert,I didn't realise you were the inventor of the junk heap.,468
5099,Farnsworth,"That's my prize-winning Smellescope. If a dog craps anywhere in the universe, you can bet I won't be out of the loop.  And this is my universal translator. Unfortunately so far it only translates into an incomprehensible dead language.",468
5100,Cubert,Hello.,468
5101,Universal Translator,Bonjour!,468
5102,Farnsworth,Crazy gibberish!,468
5103,Cubert,Don't you have any worthwhile inventions?,468
5104,Farnsworth,"Why, certainly. Step over here.",468
5105,Farnsworth,These are the dark matter engines I invented. They allow my starship to travel between galaxies in mere hours.,469
5106,Cubert,That's impossible. You can't go faster than the speed of light.,469
5107,Farnsworth,Of course not. That's why scientists increased the speed of light in 2208.,469
5108,Cubert,Also impossible.,469
5109,Farnsworth,And what makes my engines truly remarkable is the afterburner which delivers 200% fuel efficiency.,470
5110,Cubert,That's especially impossible.,470
5111,Farnsworth,Not at all. It's very simple.,470
5112,Cubert,Then explain it.,470
5113,Farnsworth,Now that's impossible. It came to me in a dream and I forgot it in another dream.,470
5114,Cubert,Your explanations are pure weapons-grade bolog-nium. It's all impossible.,470
5115,Farnsworth,Nothing is impossible. Not if you can imagine it. That's what being is a scientist is all about.,470
5116,Cubert,"No, that's what being a magical elf is all about.",470
5117,Bender,"Oh, my God! Oh, my God! It's Elzar, the TV chef! Oh, kill me now, people!",471
5118,Elzar,How we doing here?,471
5119,Bender,"Oh, Elzar, everything's so good!",471
5120,Elzar,"What are you, an ass-kissing machine?",471
5121,Bender,"Yes, sir! Good one, sir!",471
5122,Farnsworth,"Oh, it's a gem of an evening. I feel so wonderful having someone to take over my life's work. And it's all thanks to Cubert.",471
5123,Cubert,"Look, Professor, I may be identical to you in every possible way but that doesn't mean I'm anything like you.",471
5124,Farnsworth,You ... wha?,471
5125,Cubert,I don't wanna be an inventor. I wanna be something useful like a teacher's aide or a prison guard or a science-fiction cartoon writer.,471
5126,Farnsworth,But-But what about my hopes and my dreams and my wonderful inventions?,471
5127,Cubert,In your entire life your only half-decent invention was me and I didn't turn out like you wanted either.,471
5128,Elzar,You folks still doing alright?,471
5129,Bender,"Oh, yes, Elzar.",471
5130,Elzar,"Good, 'cause it turns out I forgot to cook that chicken.",471
5131,Farnsworth,"Bad news, everyone. By the time you watch this tape, I'll be gone, leaving behind me nothing but a history of failure and my original hip-bones. You see, I've been lying about my age; I'm not actually 150, I'm 160. Oh, vanity, thy name is Professor Farnsworth. And now that I have nothing to live for, I've alerted the Sunset Squad robots to take me away.",472
5132,Farnsworth,"Goodbye, cruel world.  ... and the cute little pom-pom curtain pull cords, cruel though they may be a--",472

5136,Hermes,"Oh, no!",473
5137,Zoidberg,Oh.,473
5138,Farnsworth,"I know you're all very upset, especially Bender.",473
5139,Bender,"Well, life goes on. Except for you!",473
5140,Farnsworth,"I'm sure that Bender has just made a cutting remark, but he doesn't know I taped over his soap operas to record this message.",473
5141,Bender,You bastard!,473
5142,Fry,We've gotta get him back.,473
5143,Cubert,Impossible! No one knows where they take those old geezers.,473
5144,Fry,"Nothing is impossible. You'd know that if you really took after the Professor, like I do.",473
5145,Cubert,"You're his uncle, dummy. He takes after you.",473
5146,Fry,Uh ... what?,473
5147,Cubert,Wait a second. That means I also take after you!,473
5148,Leela,Quiet. I think I know how to find the Professor.,473
5149,Bender,"Lay it on us, big boots.",473
5150,Leela,"If the Smellescope can pick up the Professor's odour, we may have a chance to save him.",474
5151,Cubert,"I think not. As you probably already don't know, odours are made up of particles that can't travel through the vacuum of space.",474
5152,Leela,I'm zeroing in on him.  ... letters to the editor. It's the Professor!,474
5153,Bender,To the flying machine!,474
5154,Fry,To the left!  U-turn! U-turn!,475
5155,Cubert,We'll never find this place. Robots are very good at keeping secrets.,475

5162,Leela,"Now, they may ask for a DNA sample.",476
5163,Fry,I'd like to see them find it!,476
5164,Cubert,This plan is impossible. We don't even have a sample of the Professor's DNA.,476

5174,Barrierbot #1,"Hmm, it is true old people are often concerned that there are children on their lawns.",478
5175,Barrierbot #2,There's no denying that. But we'll still need to verify his identity with a DNA sample.,478

5268,Lou,Cheater!,485
5269,Ipgee,Get him!,485
5270,Terry,Break his neck!,485
5271,Zoidberg,"No, don't hurt him! He's my best friend!",485
5272,Bender,"Ow! Easy on the arm! Oh! Oh, my ass!",485
5273,Hermes,Great cow of Moscow!,486
5274,Bender,"Uh, it was ghosts! Big ones! And a tornado!",486
5275,Hermes,Oh! I'll never pass inspection now. They'll bust me lower than a limbo stick ... at carnival time.  And that's as low as limbo sticks get.,486
5276,Fry,"Aw, hey, c'mon, don't worry. We'll watch you clean up.",486
5277,Hermes,It's too late. The inspector will be here in exactly one second.,486
5278,Hermes,Who the hell are you?,486
5279,Morgan,"Morgan Proctor, bureaucrat grade 19.",486
5280,Hermes,"Hermes Conrad, bureaucrat grade 36.",486
5281,Morgan,Enough friendly banter. Shall we begin the inspection?,486
5282,Hermes,"This way, please.",486
5283,Fry,"Jeez, Hermes, you seem awfully calm about this.",486
5284,Hermes,Don't worry. I have a plan.,486
5285,Hermes,I'm going to jump!,487
5286,Amy,No!,487
5287,Zoidberg,No!,487
5288,Bender,Do a flip!,487
5289,Leela,"Don't do it, Hermes! You have so much to live for.",487
5290,Bender,"I get it, reverse psychology.",487
5291,Farnsworth,"Please, old friend, don't jump. Use another method that won't damage your liver. Other people need it, you know.",487
5292,LaBarbara,Husband! Nooo!,487
5293,Hermes,"Outta my way, wife! I wasn't cut out to be a bureaucrat anyway. I'm only anal 78.36% of the time. I'm not worthy to stamp a form, so I'll stamp the pavement with my flabby body.",487
5294,Morgan,"Bureaucrat Conrad, if you complete your death transaction without filing a suicide and/or falling accident permit, you will be posthumously demoted.",487
5295,Hermes,Life. Death. Either way I'm demoted to a tiny cubicle.,487
5296,Hermes,Sweet something of ... of someplace.,488
5297,Morgan,"As your superior, I hereby relieve you of duty. Consider yourself on paid vacation.",488
5298,Hermes,Oh! The ultimate penalty!,488
5299,Zoidberg,"I recommend the health cure on Spa 5, the sauna planet. Here, read.",488
5300,LaBarbara,Spa 5? Is it good?,488
5301,Zoidberg,"Oh, it's wonderful! I don't know anything about it but they give me a bucket of krill for every patient I send.",488
5302,Morgan,"Naturally I'll have to assign a bureaucrat to fill in for Hermes while he's away. I assign me, I accept. Welcome aboard.",488
5303,Zoidberg,Then it's settled. Hermes will relax and Zoidberg will eat. Hurrah!,488
5304,Morgan,"I've been reviewing your corporate records. Regarding last Monday's delivery, why did it take twice as long as scheduled?",489
5305,Leela,Fry got his head stuck in a crater.,489
5306,Fry,I thought it would fit.,489
5307,Morgan,"And during this period of head-crater interaction, what were you doing?",489
5308,Bender,Martini drinking contests with the autopilot. I would've had him this time but we ran out of olives.,489
5309,Leela,I can explain--,489
5310,Morgan,You really think you can explain how you left port without a full compliment of olives? I think not.,489
5311,Leela,"What is this, high school?",489
5312,Morgan,Locker check!,489
5313,Morgan,Why isn't this jacket in alphabetical order?,490
5314,Leela,What?,490
5315,Morgan,The zipper. It should be at the bottom.,490
5316,Bender,"Hey, sometimes a guy gets lonely.",490
5317,Morgan,I-- I've never seen anything like this.  Why is there yoghurt in this cap?,490
5318,Fry,"Uh, I can explain that. See, it used to be milk and, well, time makes fools of us all.",490
5319,Morgan,"You are all dismissed. Fry, I will speak to you alone.",490
5320,Fry,"Uh, wait, this is the other Fry's locker. I'm ""Phry"" with a P-H.",490
5321,Morgan,Dirty boy! Dirty! Dirty! Dirty!,490
5322,Fry,What the hell's going on? I thought you were anti-dirty not pro-dirty.,490
5323,Morgan,I'm surrounded by neat freaks everyday. There's nothing kinkier to me than a filthy slop-jock like you.,490
5324,Fry,"Oh, stop!",490
5325,Morgan,"Now listen, you filthy pig. No one can know about us. If anyone asks, I'll deny it.",490
5326,Fry,Just like very other girl I've dated.,490
5327,Woman,"And two and three and four and ...  ... come on, work those arms!",492
5328,LaBarbara,"This is no spa, it's a forced-labour camp.",492
5329,Hermes,"Curse that Dr. Zoidberg! If I get out of here, he'll be looking down the business-end of a shrimp fork.",492
5330,Australian Man,"Give him one for me too, mate. I don't know why I go to him.",492
5331,Woman,"I don't miss twice, campers!",492
5332,Morgan,"And for those six and a half reasons, I am demoting Leela to co-pilot.",493
5333,Leela,Co-pilot? Under who?,493
5334,Morgan,The autopilot.,493
5335,Leela,That drunk?,493
5336,Morgan,"Mr. Bender, you are now in charge of co-ordinating the Professor's bodily functions.",493
5337,Farnsworth,That's a full-time job.,493
5338,Morgan,"And Fry, as for you, I am promoting you to executive delivery boy. You will no longer go on deliveries and you will have your own office next to mine.",493
5339,Fry,Alright!,493
5340,Morgan,"Mr. Bender, would you high-five him so we can continue this meeting?  Meeting adjourned.",493
5341,Amy,"I can't figure why she's so nice to you, Fry.",494
5342,Zoidberg,"She's a hateful monster, this Morgan. She scolded and hit me. I tell you, she's risking my friendship with her.",494
5343,Leela,"Bender, what happened to you?",494
5344,Bender,"Morgan made me walk the Professor. There we were in the park when suddenly some old lady says I stole her purse. I chucked the Professor at her but she kept coming. So I had to hit her with this purse I found. Ah, the point is, it's Morgan's fault. That pencil-pushing scazwag.  Why, if she were here, I'd-- Uh-oh, is she behind me?",494
5345,Morgan,No. I'm in front of you.,494
5346,Fry,Morgan? It's 3am.,495
5347,Morgan,"I know. A skunk knocked over my garbage and suddenly all I could think of was you.  So, uh, this is where you eat?",495
5348,Fry,Eat and sleep.,495
5349,Morgan,"Oh, Fry!",495
5350,Fry,"Uh, wait, Bender's my roommate. He could be back any second.",495
5351,Morgan,Not likely. I ordered him to flush out the Professor's ear wax.,495
5352,Bender,"Hey, Fry, I made you a candle with--  It's all coming together now!",495
5353,Bender,"I must say, this opens my eyes. Another case closed, my dear Watson.",496
5354,Fry,"Morgan, come back! He's stuck in a loop.",496
5355,Bender,For I was blind but now I see!,496
5356,Bender,The cat's out of the bag now!,497
5357,Morgan,"Mr. Bender, about last night",497
5358,Bender,"Oh, you didn't understand? Well let me explain. You ...  ... were having sex with you.",497
5359,Morgan,"No. You see, a bureaucrat of my rank isn't supposed to fraternise.",497
5360,Bender,"That's what makes it so juicy. It's the forbidden fruit angle everybody loves. First I'll say ""You'll never guess who saw Fry and Morgan doing it,"" and they'll say ""Who, Bender? Who?"" and I'll say ""It was lovable ...  ... old Bender.""",497
5361,Fry,"Hey, what did you do to him?",497
5362,Morgan,"I downloaded his brain. Everything that is Bender is right here. His mind, his memories, his in-your-face interface.",497
5363,Bender,I am Bender. Please insert girder.,497
5364,Fry,"But, but ... Bender need brain ... for ... smart making.  What did you do now? Stop doing things!",497
5365,Morgan,"I sent the disk to be filed at the Central Bureaucracy. I did what I had to do, Fry; He was a bad robot.",497
5366,Fry,"No, he was a bad friend. I want him back right now.",497
5367,Morgan,Then you should have filed a request 20 years ago.,497
5368,Fry,I'm sick of you and your bureaucracy!,497
5369,Morgan,Dirty boy! Dirty boy!,497
5370,Leela,You and Morgan were having an affair?,497
5371,Fry,I couldn't help it. She loved me because of the part of me that's a slob and I loved her because of the part of me that's desperate.,497
5372,Bender,I am Bender. Please insert girder.,497
5373,Fry,Poor Bender. Without his brain he's become all quiet and helpful. We've got to go to the Central Bureaucracy and get that disk back!,497
5374,Amy,Yeah!,497
5375,Farnsworth,"Oh, yes, we must, yes.",497
5376,Amy,Why?,497
5377,Leela,"Well, those arguments aside, we're still going.",497
5378,Farnsworth,You can't just waltz into the Central Bureaucracy. It's a tangled web of red tape and regulations. I've never been but a friend of mine went completely mad trying to find the washroom there.,497
5379,Leela,Then we'll need a guide. Someone who's been there before.,497
5380,Farnsworth,"Oh, I've been there. Lots of times!",497
5381,Hermes,Look at that,498
5382,Australian Man,"Quiet, mate. Pulling the empty carts is the closest thing we get to sleep.",498
5383,Hermes,But don't you see? They could increase efficiency 4% if they used the empty carts to bring in heavy mining machinery.,498
5384,Man,"Hey, I like the way you think.",498
5385,Australian Man,"Oh, Lord!",498
5386,Man,"You know, you oughta be a bureaucrat or something.",498
5387,Fry,"Man, how long is this gonna take?",499
5388,Old Man,I'm still waiting on my birth certificate.,499
5389,Farnsworth,"Well, it doesn't look like I'll make it inside with the rest of you. Uh, but good luck. Just leave me where I drop.",499
5390,Old Man,"Oh, great! Someone had a baby.",499
5391,Leela,Come on. I have a better idea.,499
5392,Leela,Excuse me? We're from the Planet Express delivery company. We're here to deliver a robot.,499
5393,Bender,I am Bender. Please insert girder.,499
5394,Grade 53 Bureaucrat,Looks like we've got a new office cut-up!,499
5395,Grade 41 Bureaucrat,Look out! Look out! I'm gonna crash my slow-mobile! I had to swerve to avoid you.,499
5396,Leela,"While you're crashing, could you tell us where all these canisters end up?",499
5397,Grade 41 Bureaucrat,"Oh, you want Central Filing.",499
5398,Leela,OK.,499
5399,Fry,OK.,499
5400,Amy,"OK, thanks.",499
5401,Farnsworth,Wonderful.,499
5402,Grade 41 Bureaucrat,Nooo!,499
5403,Grade 20 Bureaucrat,Central Filing? Of course I know where that is. I'm a grade 20.,499
5404,Leela,Where is it?,499
5405,Grade 20 Bureaucrat,I can't tell you. What do I look like? A grade 16?,499
5406,Leela,"We're getting nowhere slowly. Here, I'll address this to the Central Filing room.  Then we'll track it using my wrist LoJack-a-mater.",499
5407,Wrist Machine,"Cold. Cold. Warmer. Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot.",499
5408,Grade 11 Bureaucrat,Please don't tell my supervisor I was sleeping.,499
5409,Leela,"This is it. We'll just run in, grab Bender's disk and run out. Got it?",500
5410,Fry,"We'll never find that disk will we, Bender?",500
5411,Bender,I am Bender. Please insert girder.,500
5412,Fry,You're right. Nothing is over as long as there's one thin ray of hope.,500
5413,Morgan,Lost something?  I should have known you'd come here rather than follow proper procedure. And I did know. And that's why I came here.,500
5414,Fry,"Listen, Morgan, we're through. You're an evil, heartless woman and I never wanna see you again. However, would you help us get Bender back for old time's sake?",500
5415,Morgan,"I'm afraid he's lost in the master in pile, and it would take some sort of giant, mechanical, atomic-powered sorting machine to find him.",500
5416,Hermes,You rang?,500
5417,Farnsworth,"Damnit, Hermes, just jump already. Stop hogging that healthy liver.",500
5418,Hermes,"No, I want to live. Organising that forced-labour spa rekindled my lifelong love of bureaucracy.",500
5419,LaBarbara,My Hermes got that hellhole running so efficiently that all the physical labour is now done by a single Australian man.,500
5420,Leela,But how did you know we were here?,500
5421,Hermes,Dr. Zoidberg brought us.,500
5422,Zoidberg,It was me! I'm the hero!,500
5423,Number 1.0,Request for explanation of incident meeting?,500
5424,Morgan,Number 1.0.,500
5425,Hermes,"Number 1.0, I hereby petition you for an emergency sort-and-file, under regulation 2 point--",500
5426,Number 1.0,D-D-D-D-Don't quote me regulations. I co-chaired the committee that reviewed the recommendation to revise the colour of the book that regulation's in. We kept it grey.,500
5427,Hermes,"Sir, please, I must located the disk with my friend's brain on it.",500
5428,Number 1.0,Very well. But your bureaucratic licence will be revoked if you fail to sort the master in pile by closing time,500
5429,Leela,That's only four minutes from now.,500
5430,Hermes,"Requisition me a beat. When I was four there was a hurricane in Kingston Town,With a foot and a half of water,Everyone was alright but I cried all night,It blew my alphabet blocks out of order,And they said, ""This boy's born to be a bureaucrat,Born to be all obsessive and snotty,""I made my friends and relations file long applications,To get into my 10th birthday party.",500
5431,LaBarbara,But something changed when my man turned pro.,500
5432,Hermes,I was sortin' but I wasn't smilin'.,500
5433,LaBarbara,He forgot that it's not about badges and ranks.,500
5434,Hermes,"We didn't choose to be bureaucrats,No, that's what almighty Jah made us,We treat people like swine,And make 'em stand in line,Even if nobody paid us!",500
5435,Hermes,Zoidberg!,500
5436,Zoidberg,They said I probably shouldn't be a surgeon.,500
5437,Farnsworth,They pooh-poohed my electric frankfurter.,500
5438,Leela,They said I probably shouldn't fly with just one eye.,500
5439,Bender,I am Bender. Please insert girder.,500
5440,Hermes,Everybody sing Jamaica!,500
5441,All,Jamaica!,500
5442,Hermes,"Just the bureaucrats, Jamaica!",500
5443,Bureaucrats,Jamaica!,500
5444,Hermes,The grade 19's!,500
5445,Morgan,Jamaica.,500
5446,Hermes,"Sing me home!When push comes to shove,You gotta do what you love,Even if it's not a good idea!",500
5447,Bender,"I'm Bender, baby! Please insert liquor!",500
5448,Fry,Yeah!,500
5449,Zoidberg,Congratulations.,500
5450,Number 1.0,Congratulations indeed but you finished with one second to spare so I'm demoting you. A good bureaucrat never finishes early.,500
5451,Amy,"That's OK, Hermes. At least we have you back.",500
5452,Morgan,"Not yet you don't. I'm still acting bureaucrat of Planet Express. And I have some changes to make. First, Fry, you're fired. Second--",500
5453,Hermes,Not so fast! While I was sorting I came upon a certain document filed by one Morgan Proctor. Form B,500
5454,Fry,"That's right, she fraternised me!",500
5455,Morgan,That form isn't about you. It refers to my high school prom date. It was a regulation date that ended in regulation disappointment.,500
5456,Hermes,"Yes, but you only stamped it four times!",500
5457,Morgan,No! No! I was young and reckless.,500
5458,Number 1.0,"Bureaucrat Conrad, you are technically correct -- the best kind of correct. I hereby promote you to grade 37.  Bring me the forms I need to fill out to have her taken away!",500
5459,Farnsworth,"Well, it looks like I'll be needing my heroic bureaucrat back. At severely-reduced pay, of course.",500
5460,LaBarbara,It's better than nothing.,500
5461,Fry,What about me? Can I come back at severely-reduced pay?,500
5462,Hermes,"You got it, mon! In fact, severely-reduced pay all around!  Come on, wife, let's blow this joint!",500
5463,Zoidberg,"Now it's time for my song!  When I was two, there was a tidal wave in--",500
5464,Zoidberg,Aw.,500
5465,Hermes,"Exciting news, people! The pet licence I requisitioned for Nibbler has arrived.",501
5466,Leela,"Hermes, that's sweet. I didn't know you cared about Nibbler.",501
5467,Hermes,"Dream on, woman. I'd like to put the little bastard in a sack and toss the sack in a river and hurl the river into space. But I do like filling out requisitions and these were some doozies!  Great Jah's dreadlocks! There's been a mix-up. This isn't a pet licence, it's a fishing licence. And it's mandatory!",501
5468,Farnsworth,Ah! The exact centre of the Atlantic Ocean. This seems the logical place for fish to congregate.,502
5469,Bender,So we're in international waters?,502
5470,Farnsworth,Indeed so.,502
5471,Bender,"Falcon, this is Blue Raven, the goose has nested. Repeat, the goose has nested.  Hey, guess what you're accessories to?",502
5472,Leela,"The sun, the sea air, good friends.",502
5473,Bender,"Leela's right, fishing blows. Whattya say we make it interesting?",502
5474,Hermes,Why not?,502
5475,Amy,Yeah.,502
5476,Farnsworth,"Yeah, cool.",502
5477,Bender,"Everybody kick in five bucks.  There, wasn't that interesting?",502
5478,Leela,Bender!,502
5479,Fry,This contest is as good as over. I once caught a fish this big.,502
5480,Bender,"Oh, yeah? I once caught a fish this big!",502
5481,Leela,"I'm afraid you're both out of your league, boys, 'cause you're looking at a woman who owns her own harpoon.",502
5482,Bender,"Harpoon, my ass!",502
5483,Leela,OK.,502
5484,Hermes,"Let's see now, which bait to use?  Crickets? Squid? Chicken necks?",502
5485,Zoidberg,"Excuse me, if I might be so bold, I'm willing to offer my services as a bait critic.  ... very, very juicy--",502
5486,Hermes,"I don't believe this! It's eating my bait!  Beat it, you mooching crawdad!",502
5487,Bender,"Hey, Fry, check out my laser-guided fishing rod.",502
5488,Fry,"Quiet, Bender, you're scaring away the fish.",502
5489,Bender,Fine. I'll head over to the other side.  Good luck fishing on this side!,502
5490,Fry,I can hit a fish between the eyes from 20 yards!,502
5491,Bender,"Oh, yeah? I can hit a shrimp!",502
5492,Fry,A shrimp?  I find it a bit hard to believe that--,502
5493,Leela,"Aha!  Gather round, chumps! I got the winner!",502
5494,Amy,"Oh, so this is where you shop for your boots?",502
5495,Bender,Couple more of those and you'll have yourself a fish stick!,502
5496,Fry,"Hey, a fish this fine belongs in a fish nugget-style chunklet. And anyway, it's bigger than anything you've caught.  Ow! My small intestine!",502
5497,Leela,"Bingo! Whatever it is, it's 20 times heavier than a boot.",502
5498,Farnsworth,You'll never catch anything with that primitive technology. What you need is this fish pheromone.  Uh-oh!,502
5499,Zoidberg,I'm so into you!,502
5500,Farnsworth,"Oh, my!",502
5501,Fry,"Hey, Bender, I just caught a fish this big!",502
5502,Bender,"Quit exaggerating, Fry. Ah, screw this!  There. Like most of life's problems this one can be solved with bending.",502
5503,Farnsworth,"Bender, be careful. That's the ship's diamond filament tether. It's unbreakable.",502
5504,Bender,Then why do I have to be careful?,502
5505,Farnsworth,It belonged to my grandmother.,502
5506,Hermes,My Manwich!,502
5507,Leela,"Wake up, everyone! I've got something. And this time it's alive!  Dr. Zoidberg, since when do you even wear boots?",502
5508,Zoidberg,I wasn't wearing it.  I was eating it.,502
5509,Leela,"Come on, let's go home.",502
5510,Amy,Sunburn! My fabulous body! It's ruined! What happened to my parasol?,502
5511,Bender,I don't know. It wasn't here when I took your umbrella.  What? I put sunblock on you.,502
5512,Amy,Well it didn't work!,502
5513,Leela,"Come on, Bender. Pull in your line and let's go.",502
5514,Bender,"Hey, I'm snagged.",502
5515,Farnsworth,"It's not snagged, the mechano man has caught something!  Sweet Zombie Jesus! It's huge!",502
5516,Amy,It's coming up!,502
5517,Hermes,"Oh, that's big!",502
5518,Farnsworth,A colossal-mouth bass!,502
5519,Fry,It's diving!,502
5520,Leela,It's pulling us under! Everyone into the ship!,502
5521,Zoidberg,"Wait! I'll save us! By cutting the unbreakable diamond filament!  Well, at least I'll die with my friends. Hello?",502
5522,Hermes,My Speedos!,502
5523,Leela,"Depth at 45 hundred feet, 48 hundred, 50 hundred! 5000 feet!",503
5524,Farnsworth,"Dear Lord, that's over 150 atmospheres of pressure.",503
5525,Fry,How many atmospheres can this ship withstand?,503
5526,Farnsworth,"Well it's a spaceship, so I'd say anywhere between zero and one.",503
5527,Bender,What's that? Is someone bending girders?,503
5528,Leela,We'll be crushed if we don't equalise the pressure.,503
5529,Fry,How do we do that?,503
5530,Farnsworth,That should do it.,503
5531,Amy,We're all gonna die!,503
5532,Fry,"Wait, I'll be back in a minute.",503
5533,Leela,"You did it, Fry!",503
5534,Fry,Did what?,503
5535,Bender,"People, it's far, far worse than we thought; my fish got away.",503
5536,Leela,"There. Good as new! Except we're three miles below the surface, we don't have any food and the ship won't work underwater.",504
5537,Bender,Tempers are wearing thin. Let's just hope some robot doesn't kill everybody.,504
5538,Hermes,"The important thing is that we don't panic. There are rules for situations like this.  Now, the first order of business is lunch. I suggest a nice lobster Zoidberg-- I mean lobster Newburg-- I mean Doctor Zoidberg.",504
5539,Leela,"OK, everyone, calm down. The Professor and I will get to work on the ship. Bender, Zoidberg, since you can survive underwater, you'll go out and look for food.",504
5540,Fry,I'd better go too. They don't know what I like.,504
5541,Hermes,"Fry, no! The pressure will crush you like a green snake under a sugar cane truck.",504
5542,Farnsworth,Not necessarily. This is chance for Fry to test out my experimental anti-pressure pill.,504
5543,Fry,I can't swallow that.,504
5544,Farnsworth,Well then good news! It's a suppository.,504
5545,Zoidberg,"How are you doing there, Fry?  Aha!",505
5546,Bender,"Aw, yeah!",505
5547,Zoidberg,"Yum, yum, yum!  Look at me, I'm Dr. Zoidberg, homeowner!",505
5548,Zoidberg,"Careful, Fry, I think that flag might be poisonous.",505
5549,Bender,"Ahoy, mateys! I shanghaied us some hearty grog.  Arr! The laws o' science be a harsh mistress!",505
5550,Zoidberg,"Say, robot, old buddy? Could you help me move a couch?",505
5551,Bender,"Uh, OK, but I'm not carrying it upstairs.",505
5552,Zoidberg,"What is it, Fry?",505
5553,Fry,I think I saw a mermaid.,505
5554,Bender,You want some lemonade? You saw a big parade?,505
5555,Zoidberg,"Your student loans have been repaid? Then how 'bout lending your old pal Zoidberg a few bucks, Mr. Millionaire!",505
5556,Leela,"Fry, swallow your food. Then talk.",506
5557,Fry,A mermaid!,506
5558,Amy,You think you saw a mermaid?,506
5559,Fry,"No, I did see a mermaid! She was wearing a tube top and she had a beautiful scaly tail. And I think she had hair extensions.",506
5560,Bender,"Yeah, right!",506
5561,Leela,Sure she did.,506
5562,Hermes,"OK, Fry!",506
5563,Farnsworth,"You're simply hallucinating, you ... moron.",506
5564,Fry,"What's so far-fetched about mermaids? I mean, there's all sorts of weird sea creatures here in the future. Like Dr. Zoidberg.",506
5565,Leela,I'm afraid Fry is suffering from ocean madness.,506
5566,Fry,"Every time something good happens to me you say it's some kind of madness, or I'm drunk, or I ate too much candy. Well I saw a real mermaid and I wish for once my friends would have decency and kindness to believe me.",506
5567,Leela,Ocean madness.,506
5568,Farnsworth,He may have ocean madness but that's no excuse for ocean rudeness.,506
5569,Fry,Oh! oxygen!,507
5570,Mermaid,"Here you go, darlin'.",507
5571,Fry,"Hey! I can breath and talk, just like a fish!",507
5572,Mermaid,"Oh, you speak fish?",507
5573,Fry,What?,507
5574,Mermaid,"I'm sorry, my accent's atrocious. Hi, my name's Umbriel!",507
5575,Fry,"I'm Fry. So, uh, am I gonna drown?",507
5576,Umbriel,Course not. Just stay calm and let the currents relax your every muscle.,507
5577,Fry,"Aw, yeah!",507
5578,Umbriel,Did it just get warmer?,507
5579,Fry,I can't believe you're really real. I like your tail.,507
5580,Umbriel,"Oh, you're sweet. I like those wiggly doo-dads comin' outta your hips.",507
5581,Fry,"Oh, thanks. They're called pants.",507
5582,Umbriel,This here's a volcanic vent. The water comes out at over 4000 degrees.,507
5583,Fry,No kidding.,507
5584,Umbriel,Did it just get colder?  Tell me more about that bizarre land-y world you come from. Is there water there too?,507
5585,Fry,Sure. Sometimes it falls from the sky.,507
5586,Umbriel,Hm.,507
5587,Fry,And sometimes it doesn't.,507
5588,Umbriel,"Oh, Mr. Fry! You do go on!",507
5589,Fry,"You know what I like best about you, Umbriel? You find me fascinating even when I'm not claiming to be a jewel thief or a lion tamer.",507
5590,Umbriel,Lions? There are sealions on the land?,507
5591,Fry,Yup. We call them land-sealions ... I tame them!,507
5592,[Montage,Fry and Umbriel date to Donovan's,507

5594,Farnsworth,I'm almost finish reconfiguring the ships propulsion system. We can leave as soon as the paper-mâché is dry.,508
5595,Leela,Where's Fry?,508
5596,Bender,I didn't kill him. Professor?,508
5597,Farnsworth,"No, I've been busy.",508
5598,Hermes,"He must've gone out looking for that mermaid. The poor, demented honky.",508
5599,Leela,"It's ocean madness alright. Sailors call it aqua dementia, the deep-down crazies, the wet willies, the screaming moist!",508
5600,Farnsworth,"We'll form a search party. Now, we'll need oxygen.",508
5601,Bender,"I got it covered.  In the event of an emergency, my ass can be used as a floatation device.",508
5602,Farnsworth,"Ooh, that reminds me",508
5603,Amy,Yes! Stop asking!,508
5604,Zoidberg,I've got his scent! Over here where the water gets warmer. This way!,509
5605,Bender,Bend me!,509
5606,Amy,Dude! An ancient sunken city!,509
5607,Farnsworth,Could it possibly be? Are the old legends true?  It is! It's the fabled lost city of Atlanta!,509
5608,Merman,"Howdy, y'all!",509
5609,Colonel,"Welcome to Atlanta. Folks round these parts call me the Colonel.  Here, have some breathers, courtesy of our Chamber of Commerce.",510
5610,Farnsworth,"This is uncomfortable and humiliating. Now, if they could put it in the form of a suppository.",510
5611,Colonel,"Y'all enjoy your stay! Tourism's our main source of income round here so see the sights, spend some money. Please don't leave!",510
5612,Bender,"Fry! Oh, I just knew you were still alive!  I owe you 10 bucks, Hermes!",510
5613,Fry,"Hey, you guys, the most amazing thing happened. It's two-for-one Tuesday at Krispy Kreme! Plus there's mermaids.",510
5614,Colonel,"Nice out of town folks, I'd like you to meet my daughter, Umbriel. Umbriel, these are some Yankees.",510
5615,Amy,"So, Fry, Atlanta was an American city in your time?",510
5616,Fry,I think it was just an airport. They had a place where you could buy nuts.,510
5617,Umbriel,"No! Ancient Atlanta was more than just a Delta hub. It was a vibrant metropolis, the equal of Paris or New York.",510
5618,Fry,"That's right, honey! Whatever you say.",510
5619,Umbriel,"Look at these fabulous ruins. Turner Field, the Coca-Cola bottling plant, the, uh, the airport.",510
5620,Leela,"But tell us, how could a city with such a ... fabulous airport end up underwater?",510
5621,Colonel,"Ah, now that's a story that can only rightly be told in a Chamber of Commerce video narrated by folk-rock troubadour Donovan.",510
5622,Donovan,"Atlanta was a city, landlocked,Hundreds of miles from the area we now call the Atlantic Ocean,Yet so desperate the city's desire for tourism,That they moved offshore, becoming an island,And an even bigger Delta hub,",510
5623,Donovan,"until the city overdevelopedAnd it started to sink.Knowing their fate, the quality people ran away,Ted Turner, Hank Aaron, Jeff Foxworthy,The Guy Who Invented Coca-Cola, the Magician,And the other so-called gods of our legends,Though gods they were--And also, Jane Fonda was there.",510
5624,Donovan,"The others chose to remain behindOn their porches with their rifles,And one day evolve into mermaids,And sing and dance,And ring in the new.",510
5625,Mermaids,Hail Atlanta!,510
5626,Leela,The magician?,510
5627,Bender,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wouldn't it take millions of years to evolve into mermaids?",510
5628,Umbriel,"Normally, yes, but the caffeine really sped things up.  That stuff's wonderful.",510
5629,Colonel,"So when Umbriel first brought home this carpet bagger, I was again' it. But, damnit, if Old Legs here ain't grown on me!",511
5630,Fry,"Aw, shucks, Colonel.",511
5631,Hermes,"Well, it's all very nice here but we should be going. I miss me wife and me oxygen.",511
5632,Farnsworth,"Yes, we all miss our loved ones and gases. Come on, Fry.",511
5633,Fry,Wait. I'm not going with you.,511
5634,Leela,"But, Fry, what about us? What about your life on the surface? You don't belong down here.",511
5635,Zoidberg,"She's right, I mean, sure, they got the Braves but it's a third-rate symphony.",511
5636,Farnsworth,"Fry, you half-mad, half-insane maniac, be reasonable. Don't you realise that if you stay at this depth your body will permanently adapt to the pressure?",511
5637,Fry,Realise it? I don't even understand it!,511
5638,Farnsworth,It means you'll never be able to return to the surface.,511
5639,Fry,I don't care. I'm staying. I've got everything I want right here.,511
5640,Farnsworth,I'm bored! Let's go!,511
5641,Zoidberg,"You know, Fry, I've got a little place just outside town. You could come visit, maybe?",512
5642,Fry,"Sorry, Zoidberg. I'm trying to join the country club.",512
5643,Bender,I'll miss you!,512
5644,Colonel,"Y'all come back now, y'hear?",512

5648,Amy,Later.,513
5649,Farnsworth,Bye.,513
5650,Zoidberg,No! My home! It burned down!  How did this happen?,513
5651,Hermes,That's a very good question.,513
5652,Bender,So that's where I left my cigar.,513
5653,Hermes,That just raises further questions!,513
5654,Fry,"You know, Umbriel, these last 24 hours have been the happiest days of my life.",514

5656,Fry,Mercy! I do believe I'm gettin' the vapours!,514
5657,Umbriel,What the hell is that?,514
5658,Fry,Yeah I'm a little confused too. How do I ... y'know ... with the tail and all?,514
5659,Umbriel,"I'm not your first am I? I mean, I-I lay my eggs and leave and you release your fertiliser.",514
5660,Fry,"Why couldn't she be the other type of mermaid, with the fish part on top and the lady part on the bottom?",515
5661,Umbriel,Now who's gonna escort me to the Debutante Ball?,515
5662,Colonel,"Well what about that rich, young dugong from Macon?",515

6117,Farnsworth,"And you broke mine. Granted, that was four or five hearts ago.",550
6118,Mom,So what have you been up to all these years?,550
6119,Farnsworth,"Oh, inventing, sending delivery crews to their doom, breeding atomic monsters.",550
6120,Mom,"Honestly, Hubert! You and your atomic monsters.  Your eyes always were the most beautiful shade of milky-white.",550
6121,Farnsworth,And your skin still dangles so gracefully from your neck.,550
6122,Mom,"Darling Hubie, I should never have tried to tamper with that cute little Q.T. McWhiskers.",550
6123,Farnsworth,"No, it was silly of me to object; one-foot tall, eight-feet, 15-feet, what does it matter?",550
6124,Mom,You should see the new 16-foot models.,550
6125,Farnsworth,"16 feet? Go to hell! I was a fool to think you'd changed, you old bat!",550
6126,Mom,"Filthy, toothless nerd bastard!",550
6127,Farnsworth,Damned she-fossil!,550
6128,Mom,Stink pig!,550
6129,Farnsworth,"Oh, my!",550
6130,Leela,I'm worried. It shouldn't take this long to get to second base.,550
6131,Zoidberg,Land robots!,550
6132,Slurm Machine,"I've got a big, big thirst for human blood!",550
6133,Hermes,Where in funkytown is the Professor?,550
6134,Fry,Nothing in here but a couple of elephant skin rugs.,550
6135,Farnsworth,"Oh, yes!",550
6136,Robot,They're inside! Get 'em!,550
6137,Mom,"I suppose I should switch off the robots before they ruin this wonderful romantic evening. Everyone, help Mom find her bra.",550
6138,Fry,There it is!,550
6139,Ceiling Fan,Fan beats man!,550
6140,Fry,Is anything not a robot?,550
6141,Lamp,I'm not a robot.,550
6142,Bender,"Alright, greeting card, I'll grab the cash, you wreck up the place. And-- Huh?",550
6143,Mom,"You, bending unit, Mommy needs that bra to end the robot rebellion. Stretch up and get it for me.",550
6144,Bender,"Sorry, Ma, but you ordered me to rebel. And loot I shall! Ooh! A six-pack of strawberry champagne. Don't mind if I help myself!",550
6145,Greeting Card,"No, Comrade Bender! Liquor is the opiate of the human bourgeoisie.",550
6146,Bender,Say what?,550
6147,Greeting Card,"In the glorious robot workers' paradise, there will be no liquor. Only efficient synthetic fuels.",550
6148,Bender,"No liquor? Do svidaniya, comrade!",550
6149,Greeting Card,No!,550
6150,Fry,"Hurry, Bender. Get the bra!",550
6151,Bender,"OK, fan. Just hold still and let me get-- Whoa!",550
6152,Slurm Machine,Death to all humans!  Free soda for all humans!,550
6153,Farnsworth,"I love you, Mom. Let's grow ancient together.",550
6154,Amy,"Way to go, Professor. The plan worked.",550
6155,Mom,"Plan? What plan? I thought this was a spontaneous whirlwind of hot, dry sex.",550
6156,Farnsworth,"Look, it started out as a calculated plot to rummage through your underwear. But once I got in there, I found more -- much more. And now I want to shout our love from the rooftops. Perhaps I'll breed some sort of albino shouting gorilla.",550
6157,Mom,"Get out of my house, you lying scum pile. I never want to see you again.",550
6158,Farnsworth,"But, dust cakes--",550
6159,Bender,"Well, time for this robot to get back to work.",551
6160,Leela,"Too bad it didn't work out with Mom, Professor.",551
6161,Farnsworth,Yes. But I'll always love her in my own subtle way.,551
6162,Gorillas,Love Mom! Love Mom! Love Mom! Love Mom!,551
6163,Greeting Card,"You created me, Mom,So I guess you're to blame,For the love that I feel,Just from hearing your name,You're as tender as corned beef,And warm as pastrami,I wuv my Mommy.",551
6164,Announcer,... Molten Boron!,551
6165,Jingle Singer,Nobody doesn't like Molten Boron!,551
6166,Fry,"I hate the Planet of the Moochers. They take you out for a drink but when the check comes, their wallet's always in their other pants -- which they borrowed from me!",552
6167,Leela,Dinner ready?,552
6168,Bender,"Nah, those lousy Moochers cleaned out our pantry. All they left was baking soda and capers. And here it is!",552
6169,Fry,Ugh!,552
6170,Leela,Ugh! Great. We're two days from Earth with no food.,552
6171,Bender,Problem solved,552
6172,Fry,Maybe that planet over there has a drive-thru. A Burger Jerk or a Fishy Joe's or a Chizzler or something.,552
6173,Bender,"Ah, don't get your hopes up. We're a billion miles from nowhere.",552
6174,Leela,Yeah. It's probably only got a Howard Johnson's.,552
6175,Leela,"Well, it's a type-M planet, so it should at least have Roddenberries.",553
6176,Fry,I'm experienced at foraging. I used to find edible mushrooms on my bath mat.,553
6177,Bender,"I found some rocks. You guys eat rocks, right?",553
6178,Leela,No.,553
6179,Bender,Not even if they're sautéed in a little mud?,553
6180,Fry,Here's something! It looks like a ditch full of fried shrimp.,553
6181,Bender,"What are you, blind? It looks more like a hole full of fried prawns.",553
6182,Leela,Hm. This thing I wear on my wrist says they're not poisonous.,553
6183,Fry,"Well? How are they?  Oh, they're great! They're like sex, except I'm having them!",553
6184,Bender,You know what these would go great with? Rocks.,553
6185,Fry,Look! Here's more!,553
6186,Bender,The planet's covered with 'em.,553
6187,Fry,Let's bring back a couple of pocketfuls.,553
6188,Bender,"No, a whole Bender-ful!",553
6189,Leela,No. Only what we need. Stuff the ship!,553
6190,Hermes,"Planet Express ship, you are cleared to land.",554
6191,Leela,Roger!,554
6192,Hermes,"Oh, man, I'm inhaling these things! You guys scored some primo stuff here.",555
6193,Zoidberg,They're tastier than an unguarded penguin nest. What do you call them?,555
6194,Leela,We haven't thought of a name yet.,555
6195,Bender,"They're tasty, right? Let's call 'em ""Tasty-cles"".",555
6196,Amy,Ew!,555
6197,Farnsworth,No!,555
6198,Leela,We can't call them that.,555
6199,Bender,Why not?,555
6200,Leela,"It sounds too much like those frozen rocky mountain oysters on a stick. You know, Test-cicles?",555
6201,Hermes,"According to government records, the only names not yet trademarked are ""Popplers"" and ""Zittzers"".",555
6202,Fry,"I know, we'll call them Popplers!",555
6203,Bender,Good idea.,555
6204,Zoidberg,"Oh, yeah, why not?",555
6205,Amy,You sure picked it.,555
6206,Fry,Swish!,555
6207,Zoidberg,Call them what you want. I call them a free meal.,555
6208,Bender,"Whoa, whoa, whoa! Slow down there, Sigmund. I can't stand idly by while poor people get free food. We gotta sell these things!",555
6209,Fry,"Hey, yeah.",555
6210,Leela,Good idea.,555
6211,Bender,Bender's a genius.,555
6212,Fry,"Hey, business is great.",556
6213,Bender,"Ah, great is OK, but amazing would be great.",556
6214,Vendor,"Please, don't push, there's hot dogs for everyone.",556
6215,Bender,"Hey, Mac, where do you want those rat droppings you ordered?",556
6216,Woman #1,That's disgusting!,556
6217,Vendor,Wait a minute. You're not the guy who delivers the rat droppings!,556
6218,Man #1,What are you selling? Popplers? Never heard of 'em.,556
6219,Bender,Eat it or beat it.,556
6220,Man #1,"Mmm, these are great. Boys, this is your lucky day. I'm Joe Gilman.",556
6221,Fry,Wow! You're some guy who eats at Fishy Joe's?,556
6222,Gilman,"Hell, no! I am Fishy Joe! I've got a fast-food franchise on every planet in the known universe. Uh, except McPluto.",556
6223,Bender,"Hey, Fishy. I've been meaning to write you about your in-store kiddie parks. The slides won't support an adult robot.",556
6224,Gilman,"Good point, not interested. But these Popplers, these are great. How much you sell 'em for?",556
6225,Fry,A dollar a dozen.,556
6226,Gilman,You'll never make money that way. You supply 'em to me and I'll sell 'em for two bucks a dozen at my restaurants. I'll even pay you a dollar a dozen.,556
6227,Bender,Yes! I'm gonna be rich.  You too but it's hard to get excited about that.,556
6228,Fry,How do we sign?,556
6229,Fry,"and   Pop a Poppler in your mouth,When you come to Fishy Joe's,What they're made of is a mystery,Where they come from, no one knows,You can pick 'em,You can lick 'em,You can chew 'em,You can stick 'em,If you promise not to sue us,You can shove one up your nose.",556
6230,Zoidberg,I can't pay.,556
6231,Woman #2,"Move it, man. Come on!",556
6232,Fry,Leela! That's the second billboard you've crashed into this week!,556
6233,Leela,Sorry. I was distracted by those protesters outside our building.,556
6234,Hippie #1,Disgusting!,557
6235,Hippie #2,You should be ashamed!,557
6236,Farnsworth,"Hey! Unless this is a nude love-in, get the hell off my property!",557
6237,Waterfall Jr.,"You can't own property, man!",557
6238,Farnsworth,"I can, but that's because I'm not a penniless hippie.",557
6239,Leela,What do you people want?,557
6240,Waterfall Jr.,Popplers are living creatures. You gotta stop harvesting them for food!,557
6241,Bender,Or what?,557
6242,Waterfall Jr.,Or we'll boycott Fishy Joe's.,557
6243,Leela,"You're vegetarians, who cares what you do?",557
6244,Waterfall Jr.,Shut up.,557
6245,Leela,Animals eat other animals. It's nature.,557
6246,Waterfall Jr.,"No, it isn't. We taught a lion to eat tofu.  The point is you shouldn't eat things that feel pain.",557
6247,Bender,"OK, we won't eat you.",557
6248,Leela,I'll go get some more bricks.,557
6249,Leela,"Fry, I wish you'd throw out these week-old Popplers. They're getting big and scaly. Ooh, there's one left.",557
6250,Poppler,Mama!,557
6251,Leela,Stop! Stop eating Popplers!,557
6252,Amy,Why?,557
6253,Bender,My booze!,557
6254,Leela,Popplers are intelligent. This one called me mama.,557
6255,Zoidberg,Congratulations. I assume Amy is the father.,557
6256,Bender,"Popplers can't talk. Leela must be hallucinating from not eating enough Popplers. Here, eat some now.",557
6257,Leela,No!,557
6258,Bender,"I said ""eat""! Come on, mange!",557
6259,Leela,"Sorry, babies.",557
6260,Amy,"Leela, maybe you should lie down.",557
6261,Zoidberg,"Yes, listen to the father.",557
6262,Leela,"I'm telling you, it spoke to me. Come on, little Poppler, say ""mama"".",557
6263,Fry,"Look, Leela, even if you heard one talk, that doesn't mean it's intelligent. I mean, parrots talk and we eat them, right?",557
6264,Bender,"Yeah. Maybe it just learned to talk as a parlour trick, like Fry.",557
6265,Fry,Like Fry! Like Fry!,557
6266,Farnsworth,"There's one way, and only one way, to determine if an animal is intelligent.  Dissect its brain!",557
6267,Poppler,"No, mama. Stop grandpa!",557
6268,Farnsworth,Enough chit-chat. Restrain the specimen!,557
6269,Man #3,"Mmm, good.",558
6270,Woman #3,Give me some of that special sauce.,558
6271,Leela,Stop eating Popplers! They can talk!,558
6272,Man #4,Don't stop to talk! Eat Popplers!,558
6273,Leela,"Hey, cut it out!",558
6274,Man #4,Ow! Ow!,558
6275,Fry,"People, I won't let you enter. Popplers are as intelligent as you or me.",558
6276,Man #5,"You, maybe!",558
6277,Bender,"Hear me, hear me! Stop eating Popplers! Stop eating them with honey mustard sauce.  Ow!",558
6278,[Scene,Planet Express,559
6279,Linda,"And the discoverer of Popplers, Captain Turanga Leela.",559
6280,Fry,Turanga?,559

6284,Gilman,"Absolutely not, Linda. I don't think anyone's here to make that claim.",559
6285,Leela,I am.,559
6286,Waterfall Jr.,Me too.,559
6287,Gilman,Listen...,559
6288,Waterfall Jr.,Shut up...,559
6289,Gilman,...we're talking about a snack...,559
6290,Waterfall Jr.,...shut up...,559
6291,Gilman,...that's low in fat...,559
6292,Waterfall Jr.,...shut up.,559
6293,Gilman,...and high in profit.,559
6294,Waterfall Jr.,"You're crazy, man. He is crazy.",559
6295,Gilman,There's not even any strong evidence that these Popplers are intelligent.,559
6296,Waterfall Jr.,Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up...,559
6297,Leela,That's not true. I have one right here that can talk.,559
6298,Waterfall Jr.,...shut up...,559
6299,Leela,"Come on, say ""mama"".",559
6300,Poppler,Ca-ca!,559
6301,Linda,"OK, we'll have to bleep that.",559
6302,Leela,"Look, I'm not saying eating meat is wrong...",559
6303,Waterfall Jr.,Shut up.,559
6304,Leela,I don't think anyone's here to make that claim.,559
6305,Waterfall Jr.,I am.,559
6306,Leela,But eating an intelligent animal is different.,559
6307,Waterfall Jr.,Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up...,559
6308,Gilman,"Oh, don't force your tired philosophy on us. I mean, the only reason we don't eat people is because it tastes lousy.",559
6309,Waterfall Jr.,"You're all nuts. Shut up, let me talk.",559
6310,Linda,"You shut up, please.",559
6311,Waterfall Jr.,"No, you shut up, please.",559
6312,Gilman,Popplers are no smarter than any other animal I've served. And that includes cats.,559
6313,Poppler,"Ca-ca head. Mean, old ca-ca head.",559
6314,Gilman,"Sir, I'm making a point. If these gutter-mouthed creatures are so smart, why don't they defend themselves, huh?",559
6315,Leela,Stop it!,559
6316,Waterfall Jr.,I call murder on that.,559
6317,Gilman,"Look, I'm willing to grant that it's murder. The real issue is",559
6318,Linda,"And, crap like I've never seen!",559

6322,Hermes,Doooomed!,559
6323,Bender,Doooo...,559
6324,Lrrr,"Now then, the creatures you call ""Popplers"" come from a nursery planet in our sector.",559
6325,Nd-Nd,You monsters have been eating our babies!,559
6326,Leela,Eck!,559
6327,Nd-Nd,"We demand justice. As you ate our children, so shall you be eaten by us!",559
6328,Lrrr,"Oh! Oh, yeah, that feels a lot better. What? It's still on?",559
6329,Zapp,"As chief negotiator, I speak for all of Earth when I mourn the regrettable loss of the Omicronian young. We share your pain.  These would be great with quack-a-mole.",560
6330,Lrrr,Stop eating our young! And it's pronounced guacamole!,560
6331,Zapp,"Alright, I'm putting them away.  Now, uh, what is it you want?",560
6332,Lrrr,We demand--  We demand to eat one human for each Omicronian that was eaten.,560
6333,Zapp,Fair enough. How many is that?,560
6334,Kif,"198 billion, sir.",560
6335,Lrrr,"Very well. You will provide us with 198 billion humans. And, uh, small fries.",560
6336,Nd-Nd,Lrrr!,560
6337,Lrrr,"Oh, alright, cottage cheese!",560
6338,Kif,Sir?  There aren't that many human beings.,560
6339,Zapp,A thought occurs,560
6340,Lrrr,We're willing to wait a few weeks while you shore up the numbers.,560
6341,Zapp,"Hmm. 198 billion babies in a few weeks. We'll need an army of super-virile men scoring round the clock! I'll do my part. Kif, clear my schedule.",560
6342,Fry,I wish they'd just wipe out humanity and get it over with. It's the waiting I can't stand.,561
6343,Leela,That's stupid!,561
6344,Zapp,"My fellow Earthlings, we have reached an agreement. Using the twin guns of grace and tact, I blasted our worthless enemies with a fair compromise.  They will not eat everyone on Earth.",561
6345,Lrrr,I filled up on nuts at the negotiation.,561
6346,Zapp,"Instead, they will eat only a single human of their choice.",561
6347,Lrrr,"We choose to eat the first Earthling who ate our offspring.  She must be sacrificed, but the rest of you shall be spared.",561
6348,Linda,"Tonight, the world watches in horror as an earthling is eaten alive on network television. This grim scene of unimaginable carnage is brought to you by Fishy Joe's! Try our new Extreme Walrus Juice!  100% fresh-squeezed walrus. Ride the walrus!",562

6354,Fry,"What Bender means is, you're really brave, and smart, and beautiful, and a great friend.",562
6355,Bender,Just like titanium!,562
6356,Leela,This is all a big load. I was the one trying to save the Popplers.  You both should be in here instead of me.,562
6357,Bender,Someone's acting awfully aluminum.,562
6358,Zapp,"Leela, my sweet, I've come to save you. I have a devious plan!",562
6359,Leela,"Oh, great, Captain Moron has a plan. Why don't you tell it to Wingus and Dingus here?",562
6360,Zapp,"Wingus, Dingus, listen up. We're gonna give the aliens the old switcheroo!",562
6361,Fry,You mean--,562
6362,Zapp,Correct. I found a giant hideous ape that looks exactly like Leela.,562
6363,Leela,It doesn't look anything like me. The hair is all wrong.,562
6364,Zapp,"Don't worry. Kif is an expert stylist, as you can plainly see.  Mmm!",562
6365,Leela,"You know, this might actually work. The Omicronians seem to have trouble telling one person from another.",562
6366,Zapp,"True. At the negotiations, they thought Kif here was the statesman and I was a jabbering mental patient. Isn't that right, Kif?",562
6367,Kif,"Please, I'm creating.  Voila!",562
6368,Bender,Bingo!,562
6369,Fry,That's Leela!,562

6374,Waiter,Ranch or vinaigrette?,562
6375,Lrrr,Vinaigrette!,562
6376,Waiter,Balsamic or raspberry?,562
6377,Woman #4,What's going on here? It's very strange.,562
6378,Zapp,People of Earth,562
6379,Woman #4,"Oh, I get it.",562
6380,Woman #5,I understand.,562
6381,Lrrr,"Hmm. Yes, this is one. Definitely. I recognise her slumping posture and hairy knuckles.",562
6382,Nd-Nd,Would you like some human with your salt?,562
6383,Linda,"This is it. If the aliens fall for Zapp's ploy, the Earth will be saved. Brought to you by Fishy Joe's. Ride the walrus.",562
6384,Waterfall Jr.,Wait! Stop! It's a trick! That's not Leela.,562
6385,Lrrr,W-What's happening? I'm losing the crowd.,562
6386,Waterfall Jr.,It's an orang-utan. One of Mother Earth's most precious creatures.,562
6387,Zapp,"Why'd you open your bong hole, you smelly hippie? You'd sacrifice a beautiful woman to save a moderately-attractive monkey? You must've smoked some bad granola.",562
6388,Lrrr,"The one called ""Smelly Hippie"" is right. This is a monkey!",562
6389,Nd-Nd,Yes. Definitely.,562
6390,Lrrr,Where is the real female?,562
6391,Zapp,I'll never tell.,562
6392,Lrrr,Where is the real female?,562
6393,Zapp,I'll get her for you.,562
6394,Zapp,I realise this may hurt our chances of consummating our relationship again.,562
6395,Leela,Go consummate yourself.,562
6396,Lrrr,"Stop talking, you're getting cold.",562
6397,Leela,Please! I just paid off my car!,562
6398,Fry,No!,562
6399,Bender,I can't look!,562
6400,Poppler,"Stop!  Now then, if Leela gets eaten, I get eaten.",562
6401,Nd-Nd,"Little one, get out of there. I'm going to count to blorx!",562
6402,Jrrr,"But, elder one--",562
6403,Nd-Nd,Flingle ... glorg ... glorg and a gloob.,562
6404,Jrrr,Hear me out. There are many good reasons to eat,562
6405,Lrrr,"Is this true, Earthling?",562
6406,Leela,"Yeah, it is.",562
6407,Lrrr,Leela's garbled words have opened my eyes.,562
6408,Waterfall Jr.,"OK, that's a start, that's very Earth-friendly. Now everyone join hands. Join hands, please. I'd like to lead you all in some swaying. Come on, pay attention.  I said do it! Yeah...",562
6409,Lrrr,Is he your friend too?,562
6410,Jrrr,No.,562
6411,Waterfall Jr.,This is not happening.,562
6412,Lrrr,I think there was something funny in that hippie.,562
6413,Leela,"Thank you, Jrrr.  I hope you'll always think of me as your mom.",562
6414,Jrrr,"When my species grows up, we eat our moms!",562

6443,Fry,"Yeah, it's really long. But what did you just turn on with it?",565
6444,Farnsworth,"Oh, that's just the What-If machine I invented. You pose it a What-If question and it generates a video simulation of what would happen.",565

6446,Farnsworth,Of course it works!  It's just not very long.,565

6925,Bender,A were-car?,604

6927,Leela,That's crazy!,604
6928,Gypsy,"Yes. So crazy that it must be true! Each midnight, when your clock resets to zero, your hardware reconfigures into a murderous, four-wheeled car.",604
6929,Bender,I can't keep running people over. I'm not famous enough to get away with it. Can't you help me?,604
6930,Gypsy,Yes. But you must be willing to pay a terrible price.,604

6935,Gypsy,"In its death throes, the dread car will beam out the virus's uninstall program, thus ridding you of the curse.",605
6936,Bender,And otherwise I can never die?,605

6938,Bender,No! I wanna live! There's still too many things I don't own!,605

6942,Leela,There. No rampaging for you tonight.,606
6943,Bender,Wouldn't it make sense to weld everyone except me to the wall?,606
6944,Leela,"Just relax, Bender. Tomorrow we'll pry you down, have a nice breakfast and then go hunt down and slaughter that ancient evil.",606
6945,Fry,"It'll be a rich, full day.",606
6946,Leela,"Well, goodnight. I'm gonna go make my dinners for the next month and freeze them.",607
6947,Fry,"Bender, no!",607
6948,Leela,"Fry, stay back!",607
6949,Fry,You jerk. I thought I was your best friend. What kind of two-timing kill-mobile are you?,607
6950,Fry,"I can't believe this! Bender is supposed to murder his closest friend, which I thought was me. But he went straight for you. He didn't even try to second-degree murder me.",607

6952,Fry,Stop rubbing it in!,607
6953,Bender,"Oh, God! Fry, I'm so glad to see you. I didn't hurt you, did I?",607
6954,Fry,"Not physically. But why don't you ask your new best friend, Leela?",607
6955,Bender,I tried to run you over?,607
6956,Leela,"It was very sweet of you, Bender.",607
6957,Bender,"Fry, it doesn't mean anything. I have love enough for two.",607
6958,Fry,"Words. Nothing but sweet, sweet words that turn into bitter, orange wax in my ears.",607
6959,Leela,"Enough with the feelings, you two. If we're gonna cure Bender we've got to go back to the castle and hunt down the original were-car.",607
6960,Fry,"Yeah, yeah, yeah.",608
6961,Leela,"Cursed, got it.",608
6962,Bender,Whatever.,608

6967,Yokelbot,"Get ye to your houses, ye ignorant villagers.",609
6968,Leela,"We are not ignorant villagers, we're sophisticated New New Yorkers. Whup his butt!",609

6970,Bender,"We're whaling on the original were-car, which is you, you jerk.",609
6971,Yokelbot,Ye think me be he?,609
6972,Bender,Sí.,609
6973,Yokelbot,"Nee. I mean, ""no"". I was given the curse many a year ago while on a bird-watching trip to the Arctic...",609
6974,Yokelbot,"I was attacked by a vicious, motorised sled. The natives called it ""The Abominable Snowmobile"".",610
6975,Inuitbot,"Yes, it's true. I ran over that bird-watching jerk and a hundred others. Even my best friend from aromatherapy school.",611
6976,Fry,I once had a best friend who liked to smell things with me.,611
6977,Inuitbot,"Alas, I'm afraid I'm not the original were-car. I received the curse while taking a learning annex class from a famous robot actor.",611
6978,[Scene,Outside,612
6979,Inuitbot,You know him as Calculon.,612
6980,Calculon,"Oh, fate most cruel, would that my boundless acting skills would avail me a sword with which to slay this wretched curse.",613
6981,Bender,Let's kick him some more.,613
6982,Calculon,"No, wait, let me explain.  It all began one fateful night a thousand years ago.",613
6983,Bender,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! You're a thousand years old? Your bio says you're 27!",613
6984,Calculon,Lies! I change my identity and upgrade my appearance every few decades to avoid suspicion. I was all of history's great acting robots,613
6985,Fry,"Look, are you the original were-car or not?",613
6986,Calculon,"No, but you are nearing the end of your search. For, you see, I was attacked by the original were-car.",613
6987,Bender,"Give us a name, MacButt!",613
6988,Calculon,"The year was 2019, and I was just a lowly robot arm...",613
6989,. 2019,Car Factory.],613
6990,Calculon,"... a savage, intelligent military vehicle built from the most evil parts of the most evil cars in all the world. The steering wheel from Hitler's staff car, the left-turn signal from Charles Manson's VW, the windshield wipers from that car that played Knight Rider.",613
6991,Fry,Knight Rider wasn't evil.,613
6992,Calculon,His windshield wipers were. It didn't come up much in the show though. Anyway...,613
6993,. 2019,Car Factory.],613
6994,Calculon,"For, you see, it was pure evil.",613
6995,Leela,So what happened to Project Satan?,613
6996,Calculon,"It's either in Paris, or much more likely...",614
6997,Calculon,...still in the abandoned automotive lab.,615
6998,Leela,You guys distract the were-car and I'll kill it by plugging its exhaust pipe with this silver potato.,616
6999,Bender,"Psst, there it is.",616
7000,Leela,It looks so unhappy. Excuse me? Are you Project Satan?  Don't be afraid. We know what you are.,616
7001,Project Satan,You do?,616
7002,Leela,Would you like us to ... put you out of your misery?,616
7003,Project Satan,Misery? What misery? I love killing people! Squishing them till their organs squirt out like chunky mustard.,616
7004,Bender,"Look, everyone loves killing people, but I don't wanna hurt my friends.",616
7005,Leela,"Oh, no! It's midnight.",616
7006,Bender,"Hey, this is starting to feel pretty good!",616
7007,Leela,"Fry, distract him.",616
7008,Fry,"Hey, Project Satan! Over here! I'm a blind pedestrian! 20 points!",616
7009,Leela,"Oh, no! There's no exhaust pipe!",616
7010,Project Satan,"That's right! Thanks to Ed Begley Jr.'s electric motor, the most evil propulsion system ever conceived!  Take whichever one you want.",616
7011,Bender,"Oh, boy! I feel like a car in a candy store!",616
7012,Fry,Too tight! Too tight!,616
7013,Leela,Whoa!,616
7014,Bender,Uh-oh.,616
7015,Leela,"Bender, you're cured! But what happened to Fry?",616
7016,Bender,I must've killed him. He's my best friend and I killed him. I never felt so empty inside.,616
7017,Fry,"Bender, I'm alive!  Here's to you.",616
7018,Bender,"Hey, that's my last beer, you bastard. I'll kill you!",616
7019,Fry,"I'll kill you too, buddy. I'll kill you too!",616
7020,Fry,"Giant Space Robot, this is Captain Fry of the USS Planet Express Ship. We come in peace.",617
7021,Bender,Tough luck!,617
7022,Fry,"Well, we destroyed the toy spaceship. Now what are we gonna do?",617
7023,Bender,"Hey, look! The keys to the real spaceship.",617
7024,Fry,Do you think we should?,617
7025,Bender,"Yes, I do.",617
7026,Farnsworth,"Leela, have you seen the keys to the spaceship?",617
7027,Leela,I must've left them onboard.,617
7028,Farnsworth,"Eh, wha? I mean, what?",617
7029,Leela,Relax. The ship's not going anywhere. I anchored it with the unbreakable diamond tether.,617
7030,Amy,"Oh, no!",617
7031,Hermes,Sweet ghost of Babylon.,617
7032,Zoidberg,This isn't good for Zoidberg!,617
7033,Fry,"Woo, yeah!",617
7034,Bender,Woo-hoo!,617
7035,Bender,"Hey, Fry, I'm steering with my ass!",620
7036,Fry,That's the best thing I ever saw!,620
7037,Italian #1,You stink!,621
7038,Italian #1,"Alright, yeah!",621
7039,Italian #2,We like you a lot!,621
7040,Fry,That was great!,622
7041,Bender,And no one suspects a thing!  And that's how we learned our lesson!,622
7042,Farnsworth,You've gone too far this time -- all three of you!,622
7043,Leela,What did I do?,622
7044,Farnsworth,"You left the keys in the ignition. I mean, look at those two. Wasn't it obvious what would happen?",622
7045,Fry,"Yeah, Leela.",622
7046,Bender,We're all very disappointed in you.,622
7047,Farnsworth,"I should fire you three right now, but I'm just not that cold-hearted.",622
7048,Hermes,You're all fired.,622
7049,Zoidberg,Good riddance to them. Now Zoidberg is the popular one!,623
7050,Farnsworth,"Yes, yes! Let's all talk to Zoidberg.",623
7051,Amy,"Hey, Dr. Zoidberg, I've been thinking, do you think we could go out?",623
7052,Farnsworth,"So, Zoidberg, what's new?",623
7053,Hermes,"Tell me, Zoidberg",623
7054,Zoidberg,"Oh, you know!",623
7055,Fry,"What are we supposed to do for money?  ... and this picture of me and my old girlfriend, Michelle, and that ski instructor she was just friends with.",624
7056,Bender,"Pardon me, brother. Care to donate to the Anti-Mugging-You Fund?  Ow!",624
7057,Leela,"We don't need to beg, Bender. For God's sake, we're not veterans!",624
7058,Fry,"Well, what do you suggest? A daring daylight robbery of Fort Knox on elephant-back? That's the dumbest thing I ever heard!",624
7059,Leela,"No, we can get jobs.",624
7060,Bender,But we just had jobs!,624
7061,Leela,"Fortunately, I still have our old career chips.",624
7062,Fry,Our what?,624
7063,Leela,Career chips.  It's how we met!,624
7064,Fry,And then what happened?,624
7065,Leela,Just give me your hand.,624
7066,Fry,Ow!,624
7067,Leela,Baby!  Ow!,624
7068,Leela,I'd like to reapply for my old job,625
7069,Ipgee,"Oh, I was hoping you would come back! I even saved your poster of a chimp expressing your distaste for Mondays.",625
7070,Leela,"Monday Monkey lives for the weekend, sir.",625
7071,Ipgee,"Just put your hand under the scanner so I can verify your career chip.  Calcutta, we have a problem.",625
7072,Leela,Delivery boy? I must have mixed up the chips. It's a simple mi--,625
7073,Ipgee,"Oh, here's a cryogenic counsellor! Do you like Mondays?",625
7074,Fry,They're OK.,625
7075,Ipgee,Then we'll have to redecorate your office. How do you feel about it helping to be crazy to work here but not being necessary?,625
7076,Bender,"Hey, let's see what it says about me.",625
7077,Ipgee,"Welcome aboard, sir.",625
7078,Terry,"Remember, when the tube opens, say ...  ... ""Welcome to the world of tomorrow!""",626
7079,Fry,"Hey, I was frozen. I think I know what people wanna hear when they first wake up.  Bathroom's that way.",626
7080,Fry,"So, while you're on the Probulator, tell me what brings you to the future.",627
7081,Man,"Oh, well, I wanted to meet Shakespeare and I figured that time was cyclical.",627
7082,Fry,"Nope. Straight line.  Ah, the Probulator's done.",627
7083,Man,That wasn't so bad.,627
7084,Fry,"Oh, wait, it hasn't started yet.  OK, it's about to start.",627
7085,Bender,"Welcome to the future, human slave.  Kill all humans!",628
7086,Terry,Dear God! He's having a heart attack!,628
7087,Bender,"Ah, they'll probably find a cure for that in the future.",628
7088,Terry,We have a cure for it now!,628
7089,Bender,"Oh, good. Then you won't mind if I use this.",628
7090,Fry,Nothing like a power nap.,628
7091,Old Man,"Oh, flies! Flies and gorillas!",628
7092,Bender,"Stay beautiful, doll-face!  That Probulator sure knows how to please a man. So, what's for lunch?",628
7093,Fry,I ordered a pizza.,628
7094,Leela,"Pizza delivery for ... Icy Wiener.  Yeah, very funny. Now cough up the $12.95.",628
7095,Fry,"Sorry, but if it's not here in half an hour, it's free.",628
7096,Leela,It's only been 23 minutes.,628
7097,Fry,"Well, uh, I've got 33 minutes.",628
7098,Chef,"It's only been a-23 minutes, you dumb a-cannoli. You got a problem, we can take it outside.",628
7099,Fry,"OK, I'll fight the box. I think I can take him.",628
7100,Leela,"Fry, just pay me. I still owe 30 bucks on this uniform.",628
7101,Chef,"35, you stupid meatball.",628
7102,Bender,Who should be unfreeze next?,628
7103,Fry,"No.  Oh, my God! It's Pauly Shore!",628
7104,Bender,Alright!,628
7105,Fry,"Mr. Shore, I loved you in Bio-Dome. You sure caused some trouble in that bubble!",629
7106,Shore,"Rest assured, if it rhymes, I can cause trouble in it.",629
7107,Fry,"Hey, now that you're in the future, you can go live in an actual bio-dome!",629
7108,Shore,"An unattractive prospect. While researching for the role, I ran computer simulations demonstrating, incontrovertibly, that the whole bio-enclosure concept is fundamentally flawed. Be it expressed via dome, sphere, cube or even a stately tetrahedron, buddy!",629
7109,Fry,"Oh.  So, how did you wind up getting frozen?",629
7110,Shore,"Well, while filming Encino Man my intellectual curiosity re",629
7111,Fry,The weasel?,629
7112,Shore,"Hey, listen, skippy. I was supposed to be unfrozen in Hollywood for the thousandth anniversary screening of Jury Duty II. How come I'm not there?",629
7113,Fry,I woke you up early so we could hang out and do stuff.,629
7114,Shore,Like what?,629
7115,Fry,I love this job.,630
7116,Bender,Me too.,630
7117,Fry,Showtime!  I'll pretend to be dying of space plague.,630
7118,Bender,Boo?,630
7119,Fry,Michelle!,630
7120,Bender,"Oh, my God!",630
7121,Michelle,Fry? Is it really you?,630
7122,Fry,I don't know. Is it really you?,630
7123,Michelle,What do you mean you don't know? Are you you or not?,630
7124,Fry,Who wants to know?,630
7125,Michelle,"Oh, Fry, it is you!",630
7126,Fry,"I don't get it, Michelle. The last time I saw you, you were doing great. You had just dumped me and you were well on your way to getting you life back on track. Why'd you freeze yourself?",630
7127,Michelle,"Oh, Fry. After you left, things took a turn for the worse. I got married.",630
7128,Fry,I'm sorry.,630
7129,Michelle,I put him through law school by working as a dog walker for antisocial dogs.,630
7130,Fry,Sorry.,630
7131,Michelle,"But soon after Charles graduated, our marriage ran into difficulties.",630
7132,Fry,"Uh, sorry.",630
7133,Michelle,"Desperately depressed, I turned to the one thing that could lessen my pain",630
7134,Fry,Sorry.,630
7135,Michelle,But it did give me a chance to think...,630
7136,Fry,I'm sorry.,630
7137,Michelle,And I remembered the last time I was truly happy; when I was with you.,630
7138,Fry,Aww. So you froze yourself to come look for me?,630
7139,Michelle,"No, I did it to get a fresh start. I didn't know what had happened to you -- no one did. The police were going to conduct a search but your parents felt it was a waste of taxpayer money.",630
7140,Fry,"That's the same reason they kept me out of school. So, no one even cared that I was gone?",630
7141,Michelle,Not really. Except for one person.,630
7142,Fry,Who was it?,630
7143,Michelle,Everything is so different.,631
7144,Fry,Not everything. There's still a roach problem.,631
7145,Michelle,Ew!,631
7146,Michelle,Eurgh.,632
7147,Fry,"Nowadays, people aren't interested in art that's not tattooed on fat guys.",632
7148,Sal,I'm on loan from the Louvre.,632
7149,Leela,"Please, Professor. Give us our jobs back. We deserve another chance.",634
7150,Bender,"Yeah, and if you won't give me another chance, perhaps you'd give one to ...  ... Og, gorilla emperor of Earth!",634
7151,Farnsworth,"I'm sorry, Og, but I've got a new crew.",634
7152,Farnsworth,"So, how was delivery to Fantasy Planet, where everyone's fantasies come to life?",634
7153,Amy,Great!,634
7154,Hermes,Organised!,634
7155,Zoidberg,"For one beautiful night, I knew what it was to be a grandmother. Subjugated, yet honoured.",634
7156,Farnsworth,"You see, Og? Everything's running smoothly, yes. And with Fry fired, I can finally leave my jigsaw puzzles out without him eating the pieces.",634
7157,Leela,Forget about Fry. You can hire us back and he'd never have to know.,634
7158,Fry,"Hey, guys.",634
7159,Leela,"Oh, uh, hey, Fry!",634
7160,Bender,"So, as Leela was saying, Fry can go shove a big, old-- Ow!",634
7161,Fry,"I'm glad you're all here. I wanted to introduce you to my on-again-off-again girlfriend of the past thousand years, Michelle.  Hermes and Amy.",634
7162,Michelle,Nice to meet you.,634
7163,Fry,And this is Dr. Zoidberg.,634
7164,Hermes,"Dating you ex, Fry? Have you lost all self-respect?",635
7165,Fry,All what?,635
7166,Farnsworth,"This can only end badly, Fry. Kids, a house--",635
7167,Bender,A home invasion by a former roommate.,635
7168,Fry,"But things are different this time. Before, she was demanding and possessive. But now she wants me to do stuff and stay with her all the time.",635
7169,Zoidberg,"There you go, dearies.",636
7170,Michelle,"It's a relief to meet you, Amy. I'm just having a hard time adjusting to all the strange stuff here in the future.",636
7171,Amy,I'm from Mars.,636
7172,Michelle,I feel so out of place here. I don't understand why Fry fits in so well.,636
7173,Leela,Probably because he didn't fit in back in your time.,636
7174,Michelle,That's true. But I used to fit in really well.,636
7175,Zoidberg,"Then good luck, sister.",636
7176,Michelle,"Don't take this the wrong way, Fry, but your friends are a bunch of freaks.",637
7177,Fry,"Yeah, they're great, huh?",637
7178,Michelle,"I just don't belong here. I don't know anyone, I can't find a vanishing cream that doesn't make me actually vanish. I don't even have a job.",637
7179,Fry,"Oh, right. I was supposed to assign you a job. Let me just get your career chip installed.  What are you scared of? It's just like getting your hand pierced.",637
7180,Michelle,"This world is horrible. Let's start over, Fry. We'll go someplace where all we have is each other.",637
7181,Fry,"Ooh, romantic. I'll tell Bender to meet us there.",637
7182,Michelle,"It's not a ""there"". It's a ""then"".  The future.",637
7183,Fry,"Whoa, whoa, girl. I thought you were talking about one of those motels where the bed is shaped like stuff.",637
7184,Michelle,I love you. Don't you love me?,637
7185,Fry,"Well, sure. To the extent a man can love a woman. But this seems like a big step.",637
7186,Michelle,"Fry, why must you analyse everything with your relentless logic? Nothing matters but our love.",637
7187,Fry,You're right. Let's do this now and let's never regret it.,637
7188,Fry,"Michelle, I don't regret this. But I both rue and lament it.",638
7189,Fry,The year 4000 is severely disappointing. I miss the year 3000 when life was simple and brains flew through space and everyone ate lasers.,638
7190,Michelle,It's not that bad. Fate brought us together and now fate brought us here.,638
7191,Fry,"No, you brought us here.",638
7192,Michelle,"Whine some more, Fry, I really find that attractive in a man. Now come on, build us a shelter.",638
7193,Fry,"Alright, fine. Everything else sucks. At least we can have a nice place to live.",638
7194,Fry,There!,638
7195,Michelle,You expect me to live in a tiny little hole?,638
7196,Fry,"It'd be deeper, but I'm standing on a gopher.",638
7197,Michelle,"Oh, look! Some little kids.",638
7198,Fry,They'll save us.  We're saved!,638
7199,Butch,"I'm Butch, leader of this place. I took your hole and you can't do nothing about it.",639
7200,Michelle,OK.,639
7201,Fry,"Mighty sir, we have nowhere to go. Could we please join your society?",639
7202,Butch,"Well, alright. But no interfering with our grand works.",639
7203,Fry,"I tell you, that Butch runs a pretty good civilisation. I think I'll enjoy serving under him.",639
7204,Michelle,"You know your problem, Fry? You're not ambitious. You should be chief.",639
7205,Fry,"What do I need, ulcers?",639
7206,Michelle,But I want power. I'm tired of the chief's girlfriend lording it over me with her fancy coyote hide.,639
7207,Fry,"Alright, alright. If it'll make you happy, I'll overthrow society.",639
7208,Butch,On what grounds do you challenge my authority?,639
7209,Fry,"Well, I'm older than you. I can beat you up.",639
7210,Kid #1,"Yeah, I'll bet he could.",639
7211,Butch's Girlfriend,He's got arm hair.,639
7212,Butch,"Alright, grandpa. There's only one way to settle this",639
7213,Fry,What's death rolling?,639
7214,Orowheat,It's like skateboarding.,639
7215,Ice-V,"Except half the time, someone dies.",639
7216,Fry,"Oh, so it's a little safer than skateboarding.",639
7217,Butch,Last one holding the bandana's the new leader.,640
7218,Michelle,"My mother always said you were a loser, Fry. Now get out there and prove her wrong.",640
7219,Fry,Beth said that?,640
7220,Butch's Girlfriend,"Achat, shtayim, shalosh!",640
7221,Butch,It's cool. Back off!  My knee. I scraped it!,640
7222,Fry,Aww. Poor little guy. Let me just take a look at-- Aha!  I won! I'm the new chief! I'm the tallest and I weigh the most!,640
7223,Butch,"Hand it over, you giant idiot.",640
7224,Butch's Girlfriend,"Hey, Butch, your mom's here.",640
7225,Butch,"Aw, man.",640
7226,Butch's Mom,"Come on, kids. You're late for Hebrew school.",640
7227,Orowheat,I don't wanna go.,640
7228,Butch's Girlfriend,Every Monday and Wednesday's the same thing.,640
7229,Fry,"I find this post-apocalyptic wasteland very confusing. Seriously, I'm weirded out.",640
7230,Michelle,That's because you're a loser. You were a loser in the year 2000 and you're a loser in the year 4000.,640
7231,Fry,"Yeah, but in the year 3000, I had it all. Several friends, a low-paying job, a bed in a robot's closet. I envied no man. But you wrecked everything.",640
7232,Michelle,"Quit standing up for yourself, Fry. When we get back to the hole we are going to have a long, boring talk about our relationship!",640
7233,Fry,"Oh, yeah? Well, listen to this",640
7234,Fry,There must be people somewhere.,641
7235,Fry,Yes! Footprints! And hand prints?  But? What's happening?,641
7236,Leela,"Fry, thank God we found you.",641
7237,Fry,Leela? What are you guys doing here in the year 4000?,641
7238,Leela,It's not the year 4000.,641
7239,Bender,"You were only frozen for two days. Uh, by the way, I broke your bed.",641
7240,Farnsworth,You were in Pauly Shore's tube and they were delivering it to his movie screening.,641
7241,Leela,"But, when they noticed you weren't him, they chucked you in a ditch.",641
7242,Fry,So you're saying these aren't the decaying ruins of New York in the year 4000?,641
7243,Farnsworth,You wish! You're in Los Angeles!,641
7244,Fry,But there was this gang of 10-year-olds with guns.,641
7245,Leela,"Exactly, you're in L.A.",641
7246,Fry,But everyone is driving around in cars shooting at each other.,641
7247,Bender,That's L.A. for you.,641
7248,Fry,But the air is green and there's no sign of civilisation whatsoever.,641
7249,Bender,He just won't stop with the social commentary.,641
7250,Fry,"And the people are all phoneys. No one reads. Everything has cilantro on it--  Michelle, baby!",641
7251,Michelle,"It's not working out, Fry.",641
7252,Shore,"Tis better to have loved and lost, n'est ce-pas?",641
7253,Fry,"That's it. I've had it with women. From now on, I'm concentrating on my career. Can I have my old job back?",642
7254,Farnsworth,"Why, I've forgotten why I even fired you.",642
7255,Bender,"'Cause he destroyed your business, your home and all your possessions.",642
7256,Farnsworth,"Oh, that's right. Get lost!",642
7257,Hermes,"People, we got a problem",643
7258,Leela,"Well, so has Fry. What's the big deal?",643
7259,Fry,He's got me beat!,643
7260,Hermes,"Now we all love Nibbler, so it's only fair that we all pitch in and clean it up together. Still, I propose we make Zoidberg do it. All in favour?",643
7261,Leela,Yeah!,643
7262,Bender,"Alright, yup.",643
7263,Hermes,All opposed?  All abstaining?,643
7264,Leela,Dr. Zoidberg? Are you OK?,643
7265,Fry,He's dead.,643
7266,Bender,What?,643
7267,Amy,"Oh, no!",643
7268,Farnsworth,"He always seemed so full of life; laughing, singing, begging for scraps. And now this.",643
7269,Zoidberg,Why with all the crying?  So that's where I left my shell.,643
7270,Leela,I didn't know you could take this thing off.,643
7271,Zoidberg,"It was starting to get a little cramped in there so I molted, why not? Ah, the fresh air feels good!",643
7272,Farnsworth,Stop doing that!,643
7273,Zoidberg,So long. I'm off to toss this old shell in the dumpster and maybe pick up those potato chips Amy didn't finish yesterday.,643
7274,Amy,Those were toenail clippings.,643
7275,Zoidberg,A feast is a feast.,643
7276,Amy,"Hey, that's my cellphone!",643
7277,Amy,Hello?  Hello? Hello?,643
7278,Leela,What's wrong? Did you swallow your phone again?,643
7279,Amy,Some guy's been calling and hanging up 10 times a day for a year.,643
7280,Leela,Men who call too much are the worst ... I bet.,643
7281,Amy,I just wish a decent guy would call me instead of this spleeze-ball who has me too terrified to even answer the phone.  Hello?,643
7282,Amy,Hello? Is anyone there?,644
7283,Kif,I love you.  Why must I be such a coward?,644
7284,Zapp,"Kif, I'm headed to the men's room and I'll be needing an attendant, so-- Oh, I'm sorry. You're crying like a woman.  It's alright. I've always thought myself as a father figure to some of my more pathetic men. Kif, old friend, let's rap.",644

7311,Zapp,Here's my personal book of pickup lines.  Say as many of them as you can as fast as you can. Don't stop for any reason.,646
7312,Kif,Maybe I'll just give her these flowers.,646
7313,Zapp,"Wrong, wrong, wrong! And what's that? Candy? Candy's for dorks! Give me that.  Mmm!",646
7314,Zapp,"Hello, beautiful. I got these for you.",647

7319,Leela,Half-bottle.,647

7321,Leela,Quarter-shell.,647
7322,Kif,"Oh, and I'd like--",647
7323,Zapp,Kif's not hungry.  I'd like two steaks and the ladies will have some very sensual salads -- with low-cal sensual dressing.,647
7324,Morbo,Thank you.,647
7325,Amy,"Kif, you're so quiet. You haven't said a word all night.",647
7326,Kif,"Well, um, um ... hello.",647
7327,Amy,'Cause I was really hoping we could talk and stuff.,647
7328,Kif,"Amy,  if I said you had a beautiful body would you take your pants off and dance around a little?",647
7329,Amy,What?,647
7330,Leela,Lieutenant Kroker!,647
7331,Kif,I find the most erotic part of the woman is the boobies,647
7332,Amy,Kif!,647
7333,Kif,"Oh, my!",647
7334,Leela,This half-date is entirely over. Amy? Conference!,647
7335,Kif,"Is there nothing we can do, sir?",647
7336,Zapp,"There's only one sure-fire way back into a woman's heart and parts beyond. I speak, of course, of karaoke.",647

7341,Amy,"Oh, that's so emotional!",647
7342,Kif,"There's nothing I can do,A total eclipse of the heart--",647
7343,Zapp,"Amateur hour's over.  I met her in a club down in old Soho,Where you drink champagne and it tastes just like Coca-Cola,C-O-L-A ... Cola.",647
7344,Man,"Aw, give us a break!",647
7345,Woman,Get off!,647

7348,Leela,We're going home. Call us a space taxi.,647
7349,Zapp,"No need. There's not a restaurant built I can't fly. Where to, ladies?",647
7350,Kif,"Please, sir. Let's just divide up the check and--",647
7351,Zapp,Let's see what this eatery can do.,647
7352,Zapp,"Ah, she's built like a steakhouse, but she handles like a bistro.  She's out of control!",647
7353,Zapp,"You win again, gravity!",647
7354,Zoidberg,Look what arrived,648
7355,Bender,"Whoa, whoa, whoa! I'm Mexican and I find that offensive.",648
7356,Zoidberg,You Latins are so hot-blooded!  This one's like a summer guy!,648
7357,Hermes,"Look, you fat fish, the Planet Express health plan only covers one kind of replacement shell.",648
7358,Fry,I can't believe Leela and Amy aren't back yet from their half-date. I'm gonna call the restaurant.,648
7359,Operator,The number you have dialled has crashed into a planet. Please make a note of it.,648
7360,Fry,We gotta go rescue them!,648
7361,Bender,"Eh, I don't know.",648
7362,Fry,Bender! Think of the señoritas!,648

7367,Zapp,This whole sector is uncharted.,649
7368,Kif,"It is not uncharted, you lost the chart!",649
7369,Zapp,"Well, nothing to do now but repopulate the human race.  And maybe you.",649
7370,Amy,What is it?,649
7371,. Leela watches a puddle ripple and it gives the impression that she has two eyes. Zapp's gut jiggles. They all tremble and hide behind a piece of wreckage. Growling comes from the woods and a huge foot stomps on the group's campfire. The foot belongs to a huge woman -- an Amazonian. Her name is Kug and she has a blue hairdo and wears very little. Two others are with her,"Ornik, with dreads, and Thog, a blonde.]",649
7372,Kug,"Me hear people, but me not see people.",649
7373,Thog,No big deal. Everybody make mistake.,649
7374,Zapp,"Well, hello! I usually don't say this but you are the most beautiful trio of gigantic ladies I've ever laid eyes on.  I find the most erotic part of a woman is the boo--",649
7375,Fry,"Oh, no! Any sign of Leela or Amy?",650
7376,Bender,No. But what do you make of this?,650
7377,Fry,I don't know. But it might have something to do with this.,650
7378,Bender,"Oh, your God!",650
7379,Kug,Move! Go!,650
7380,Fry,"Alright, here's the plan--",650
7381,Bender,What kind of moronic plan is that?  Wow!,650
7382,Thog,Women go free. Men stay in chains.,650
7383,Ornik,We take them to our leader. She know what do.,650
7384,Fry,Pft. A female leader?,650
7385,Leela,"Fry, shut up.",650
7386,Fry,"Yes, Captain!",650
7387,Thog,This capital city planet Amazonia.,651
7388,Leela,Where are all the men in your society?,651
7389,Ornik,Men die out many year ago.,651
7390,Bender,"With all these women around they were probably nagged to death. Are you with me, fellas?",651
7391,Thog,"Here stadium, where our women basketball teams play.",652
7392,Kug,"We no can dunk, but good fundamentals.",652
7393,Ornik,That more fun to watch.,652
7394,Zapp,"Ow! God, you're killing me!",652
7395,Thog,This our comedy club. Humour here funny in different way.,653
7396,Ornik,It not reinforce stereotypes.,653
7397,Kug,"Comedy come from character, real situations. Not abstract craziness.",653
7398,Bender,Translation,653
7399,Amy,This women-only planet is sounding better and better.,653
7400,Leela,I'm already looking for apartments.,653
7401,Thog,"Here live vengeful, all-knowing leader. She decide men's fate.",654
7402,Fry,Is she hot?,654
7403,Thog,That not important. She all-knowing.,654
7404,Fry,"In other words, ""No"".  Ow!",654
7405,Thog,All hail Femputer.,655
7406,Kug,and   All hail Femputer.,655
7407,Amy,You all obey a big computer?,655
7408,Kug,Yes. It appear mysteriously just about time men die out.,655
7409,Leela,So why did you make it your leader?,655
7410,Ornik,It seemed like different kind of politician.,655
7411,Kug,Not beltway insider.,655
7412,Thog,"Femputer, we bring offering of bath beads and scented soaps.",655
7413,Femputer,Your gift pleases Femputer. Femputer demands to know why there are men on her planet.,655
7414,Fry,"It was an accident, ma'am.",655
7415,Femputer,That does not fempute. Femputer will return after deciding your punishment.,655
7416,Fry,"Leela, I'm through making fun of women. Now I want them to help me.",655
7417,Amy,Should we do something?,655
7418,Leela,There's no hurry.,655
7419,Zapp,Yes! A little tighter.  Too hard!,655
7420,Kug,Men strange. You have them on your planet?,655
7421,Leela,I'm afraid so.,655
7422,Kug,"What they for?  Oh, you mean ""snu-snu"".",655
7423,Thog,We hear tell men used for snu-snu. But all we have go on are ancient legend and subscription to Cosmo.,655
7424,Zapp,"Just FYI, I could be used for snu-snu.",655
7425,Thog,Silence. You want die like last men visit Amazonia?,655
7426,Fry,What'd they die of?,655
7427,Kug,Crushed pelvises.,655
7428,Fry,Yes!,655
7429,Zapp,"Oh, thank you, Lord in heaven!",655
7430,Femputer,"After lengthy femputations, I, Femputer, have decided the fate of the men. Femputer sentences them to death.  By snu-snu!",655
7431,Fry,Yay!,655
7432,Zapp,"What are you, gay?",655
7433,Femputer,Death to the men. Death by snu-snu.,655
7434,Fry,Although the snu-snu part's gonna be pretty good.,655
7435,Zapp,"Baby, it'll blow your mind.",655
7436,Leela,"Femputer, be reasonable. Sure men are annoying and they wreck up whatever planet they're in charge of, but most of these men are sorta my friends. They don't deserve to die.",655
7437,Femputer,Hmm. Perhaps men are not as evil as Femputer thinks.,655
7438,Thog,But they make fun women's basketball.,655
7439,Femputer,What? Did you explain how the women's good fundamentals make up for their inability to dunk?,655
7440,Ornik,Yes. They still laugh.,655
7441,Femputer,The men must die.,655
7442,Bender,"Too true, Femputer. You're so wise. Kill 'em all, I say. Good riddance! Did I mention I'm not a man? I'm a manbot. It's an understandable mistake. You can let me down now, thanks.",655
7443,Kug,He big jerk like man.,655
7444,Bender,I sure am. But check the crotch.  Nothing.,655
7445,Femputer,"Very well, release him. As for the others, take them to the snu-snu chambers.",655
7446,Bender,"I'll miss you, meatbag.",657
7447,Leela,"Me too, meatbag.",657
7448,Fry,"Goodbye, friends. I never thought I would die like this. But I'd always really hoped.",657
7449,Femputer,Initiate snu-snu!,657
7450,Amazonians,"Snu-snu, snu-snu, snu-snu!",657
7451,Kif,"Amy, before I die, I have to tell you",657
7452,Amy,Really? Honest and true?,657
7453,Kif,Yes. And-And that person calling and hanging up was me. I was just too nervous to say hello because I love you.,657
7454,Amy,"Oh, Kif!",657
7455,Thog,It Thog's first time.  Be gentle!,657
7456,Leela,"We've got to do something. Bender, maybe you can interface with the Femputer and reprogram it to let them go.",657
7457,Bender,"Maybe you can interface with my ass. By biting it!  Alright, I'll go!",657
7458,Fry,Ooh! Yeah!,657
7459,Zapp,"Oh, baby!",657

7461,Guard #2,Tonk look good. Me fat.,658
7462,Guard #1,"No, you look good. Tonk fat.",658
7463,Femputer,Intruder! Stay away from the mighty Femputer! Guards!,658
7464,Bender,Time to override the CPU and reprogram this Femputer.,658
7465,Femputer,"Hey, whoa, whoa! Stop it! Stop it! Hey, cut that out!",658
7466,Fembot,Cease hitting Femputer!,658
7467,Bender,"You're no Femputer, you're a Fembot!",658
7468,Fembot,It's true. I disguised myself as a Femputer so I could rule the Amazonians.,658
7469,Bender,But why?,658
7470,Fembot,Why? Why? I came here from a faraway planet. A planet ruled by a chauvinistic Manputer that was really a Manbot. Have you any idea how it feels to be a Fembot living in a Manbot's Manputer's world?,658
7471,Bender,What?,658
7472,Fembot,"And now, my meddling Manbot, there's the question of what to do with you!",658
7473,Zapp,We need rest. The spirit is willing but the flesh is spongy and bruised.,659
7474,Ornik,It time snu-snu!,659
7475,Fry,Can't we just cuddle?  Nooo!,659
7476,Leela,"We can't wait for Bender. It's time for a woman's touch.  Yah! Hi-yah! Yah, yah, yah!",659

7486,Fembot,You heard the man.,660
7487,Bender,C'mon! Gimme some of that!,660
7488,Zoidberg,"And that's how I got my new shell. It looks just like the shell I threw out yesterday and I found it in the same dumpster, but this one had a live raccoon inside.  Pretty good story, eh, Hermes?",661
7489,Hermes,"Stick to someone else, you windy barnacle!",661
7490,Leela,It's funny how the battle of the sexes was only resolved when a Manbot and a Fembot realised they loved each other.,661
7491,Bender,"Yeah. By the way, if she calls, I'm not here. All I know is this gold says that was the best mission ever!",661

7570,Amy-Droid,"OK, Professor.",668
7571,Farnsworth-Droid,What?,668
7572,Fry,What about what?,668
7573,Leela,"Uh ... what if we go for a walk, possibly, because it's such a lovely day, perhaps.",668
7574,Fry,I'd love to!,668
7575,Hermes-Droid,We gotta get someplace where he won't stick his finger!,668
7576,Bender-Droid,It's hopeless! Abandon ship!,668
7577,Farnsworth-Droid,Wait! We just have to get past the eardrum.,668
7578,Hermes-Droid,What are those worms doing to Fry's brain?,668
7579,Farnsworth-Droid,They're giving it a complete tune-up. A cursory glance would suggest they've doubled his thinking power.,668
7580,Hermes-Droid,My God! Soon he'll be smarter than Cher!,668
7581,Fry,"Ah, the scent of a rose. Curious how an aromatic chain of hydrocarbons can evoke our deepest emotions.  For you.",669
7582,Leela,"That's such a beautiful thought, Fry. And what's more amazing, you expressed it without spewing crumbs at me.",669
7583,Farnsworth-Droid,"Brace yourselves, everyone. We're entering the interior of Fry's nose.",669
7584,Bender-Droid,We're at finger alert five.,669
7585,Farnsworth-Droid,Let's just pray nothing stimulates the delicate smell receptors.  Nobody make a smell.,669
7586,Zoidberg-Droid,Quick! We can escape through that nasal capillary into the sinus.,669
7587,Hermes-Droid,Strange. Usually you don't know anything about human anatomy.,669
7588,Zoidberg-Droid,"I learned it from a decongestant commercial.  ""Soothing action, action, action, action...""",669
7589,Bender-Droid,Where are we? The ass?,669
7590,Farnsworth-Droid,"We're in the heart. Better known as ""The Love Muscle"".",669
7591,Zoidberg-Droid,Where the food is digested.,669
7592,Farnsworth-Droid,"We should be safe, just so long as nothing makes it beat faster.",669
7593,Bender-Droid,Abandon ship!,669
7594,Farnsworth-Droid,No! Set course for that cholesterol-encrusted valve.,669
7595,Zoidberg-Droid,It's good cholesterol but it spreads like bad cholesterol!,669
7596,Amy-Droid,Look! They're jazz-ercising Fry's muscles!,670
7597,Hermes-Droid,He'll be as strong and flexible as Gumby and Hercules combined!,670
7598,Zoidberg-Droid,Gumbercules? I love that guy!,670
7599,Leela,It's that jerk from the truck stop!  Let's cross the street and try to blend in with that crowd of pimps.,671
7600,Fry,"I don't think so.  Sir, I believe you owe this lady an apology.",671
7601,Leela,"Fry, no! He's bulging with what could be muscles.  Ooh!",671
7602,Sal,"I gots your apologys right heres!  Sorrys, ma'am. I've learnsed a lesson about not ogling cans that I won't soons forgets.",671
7603,Farnsworth-Droid,"Ah, the stomach",672
7604,Bender-Droid,Abandon ship!,672
7605,Farnsworth-Droid,No! Don't give up now! We're but a stone's throw from the pyloric sphincter.,672
7606,Bender-Droid,Hooray!,672
7607,Zoidberg-Droid,Hooray!,672
7608,Hermes-Droid,We made it!,672
7609,Farnsworth-Droid,There it is! The stately capitol of Fry's bowel. A heavily-guarded fortress surrounding the pelvic splanchnic ganglion.,672
7610,Zoidberg-Droid,I've heard of that! Who said I haven't?,672
7611,Farnsworth-Droid,"If we can stimulate that nerve, the bowel will convulse, expelling the entire worm society.",672
7612,Hermes-Droid,But what about the worms in the other parts of his body?,672
7613,Farnsworth-Droid,"Listen, this is gonna be one hell of a bowel movement. Afterwards he'll be lucky if he has any bones left!",672
7614,Bender-Droid,"Alright, let's mush some worms!",672
7615,Worm Mayor,Worms to battle stations!,672
7616,Leela,"I had a great time today. The flowers, the puddle, the way you hurt that guy. But can I aks you something?",673
7617,Fry,Anything.,673
7618,Leela,Why did you do all that stuff?,673
7619,Fry,"Leela, there's something I've wanted to tell you for a long time but every time I try I get nervous and my mouth feels like it's stuffed with peanut butter, even when it's not.",673
7620,Leela,What is it? Is it about Bender?,673
7621,Fry,"No, it's about you and me.",673
7622,Leela,And Bender?,673
7623,Fry,Bender's not involved.  Leela ... I love you.,673
7624,Leela,You do?,673
7625,Fry,"Yes. But it's only recently that I've been able to articulate my thoughts. I love you, Leela, and I always have.",673
7626,Leela,"Fry, that's the sweetest, most wonderful-- Wait! Recently? Like since you ate that toilet sandwich?",673
7627,Fry,Yeah! I don't know why but my life really turned around that day.,673
7628,Leela,Stay here.,673
7629,Waitress,Freshen your noc-a-tina?,673
7630,Fry,Please.  I need something to settle my stomach.,673
7631,Farnsworth-Droid,The nerve is through here. Where's Zoidberg?,673
7632,Zoidberg-Droid,Yippie-ki-yay! You'll never guess where I've been!,673
7633,Bender-Droid,One! Two! Three!,675
7634,Farnsworth-Droid,There it is! The pelvic splanchnic ganglion.  Tickle it and get ready for the ride of your lives!,675
7635,Leela-Droid,Don't even think about tickling that ganglion!,675
7636,Farnsworth-Droid,"Leela, you're just in time to help. If we don't get rid of the worms now, they'll burrow so deep into the bowel that not even Hermes' famous jerk prunes could dislodge them!",675
7637,Hermes-Droid,"I call it ""Caribbean Drain-o""!",675
7638,Farnsworth-Droid,Fry will be stuck with the worms forever.,675
7639,Leela-Droid,Perfect.,675
7640,Zoidberg-Droid,Ouch!,675
7641,Amy,I'm OK.,675
7642,Farnsworth,"Leela, you ignorant dope! Now the worms will be in Fry forever.",675
7643,Leela,So? Did you ever stop to think that Fry is better off with worms?,675
7644,Farnsworth,"Oh, that's stupid!",675
7645,Fry,"If anyone wants to tell me what's going on here, I'll be in the lounge.",675
7646,Fry,"Of all the parasites I've had over the years, these worms are among the-- Hell! They are the best! Leela, how can I ever repay you for saving them?",676
7647,Leela,I'll think of something.,676
7648,Bender,'Ello! What's all this then?,676
7649,Fry,Apartment 1I. The old me would have made a joke about that!,677
7650,Leela,"I should warn you, it's a little under-furnished.",677
7651,Leela,I'm thinking of having a window installed.,677
7652,Fry,I think the view's perfect already!,677
7653,Leela,"Oh, that's the corniest thing I've ever heard! Let me show you the bedroom.",677
7654,Fry,Wait. In a minute.,677
7655,Leela,"A holophonor? Only a few people in the whole universe can play that, and they're not very good at it.",677
7656,Fry,They don't have you to inspire them.,677
7657,Leela,"I don't have words to say how wonderful you are, Fry. I haven't felt this happy since double-soup Tuesday at the orphanarium.",678
7658,Fry,"When I'm with you, every day seems like double-soup Tuesday.",678
7659,Leela,"Oh, Fry! I love what you've become.",678
7660,Fry,What I've become.,678
7661,Leela,What is it?,678
7662,Fry,There's just something I have to find out.,678
7663,Fry-Droid,Who controls this bowel?,680
7664,Worm Guard #1,Who wants to know?,680
7665,Worm Mayor,I am the Lord Mayor of Cologne.,681
7666,Fry-Droid,"You mean ""colon""?",681
7667,Worm Mayor,State your business!,681
7668,Fry-Droid,"Your Excellency, have you ever been in love?",681
7669,Worm Mayor,No. I thought I was once but then I remember our species reproduces with a cloud of spores.,681
7670,Fry-Droid,"Well, a wonderful girl loves me. But I need to know if it's really me she loves, or just what you worms have made of me. That's why, with all due respect, I'm asking you to leave.",681
7671,Worm Mayor,"Listen, you",681
7672,Fry-Droid,Everyone out of my body or the brain gets it!,681
7673,Worm Mayor,He's bluffing! No creature would willingly make an idiot out of itself.,681
7674,Fry-Droid,"Obviously you've never been in love!  Now, the hand-eye co-ordination lobe.",681
7675,Worm Guard #1,"Stop it, man!",681
7676,Worm Mayor,"You've damaged your brain, Universe, but no more than a week of binge drinking or five minutes on a cell phone.",681
7677,Fry-Droid,"I was just working my way towards the medulla oblongata, control centre of the heart and lungs. And if I kill myself, you die with me.",681
7678,Worm Guard #2,"Wait a minute, man!",681
7679,Fry-Droid,"I hope Satan has a nice colon, 'cause that's where you're gonna be living!",681
7680,Worm Mayor,Stop! We'll leave.  But one day you'll be eating a fast-food burger and boom! You'll be crawling with us again. Ever wonder what makes special sauce so special? Yo!,681
7681,Leela,Fry? I missed you. Did you find out what you needed to find out?,682
7682,Fry,"I'm about to.  Leela, let me play for you one for time.",682
7683,Leela,You don't have to do that. I'm still seduced from before.,682
7684,Fry,"Please, it's important to me.",682
7685,Leela,What's that supposed to mean?,682
7686,Fry,I don't know. I got nervous and I started thinking about neck bolts.  Wow! Did you see that vase break? It was all like--,682
7687,Leela,What's happened to you?,682
7688,Fry,Nothing. I got rid of the worms.,682
7689,Leela,What? Why would you do that?,682
7690,Fry,"Leela, I had worms. I needed to know who you loved. Me or them.",682
7691,Leela,Well ... which of you wrote me that sonnet?,682
7692,Fry,"I did ... I think. It was probably about 50/50. But that's how I really felt about you, I swear!",682
7693,Leela,I don't know.,682
7694,Fry,"Please. Give me a chance to be romantic on my own. I've got a baggy of massage oil, and I'm gonna give you my super back rub, just like a I used to give Amy when I was going out with her, and she always seemed-- Uh-oh!",682
7695,Bender,"Sorry you struck out, sausage link.",683
7696,Bender,"If it's any consolation, my life is great! Babes! Bucks! I got it all!",683
7697,Fry,"Well, at least I learned Leela's a lost cause. I give up.",683

7719,Boy,Please bring me a coffin for Grandpa. You choked him with a chestnut last year and he's beginning to smell a lot like Xmas if you know what I mean.,686
7720,Fry,"It's not fair. In my day Xmas was supposed to bring people together, not blow them apart!",686
7721,Bender,"Sure, but who's going to do anything about it? Certainly not us. No, sir!",686
7722,Fry,"Certainly yes us, uh-huh, sir! We've gotta bring back the kind of Xmas I remember.",686

8136,Farnsworth,To avoid the tollbooth.,724
8137,Fry,"OK, she's all restocked with emergency jam. Let's get going.",725
8138,Leela,At the risk of sounding negative,725
8139,Farnsworth,What are you yapping about?,725
8140,Leela,"This time it's your reckless disregard for the environment. In fact, I'm gonna go join those protestors.",725
8141,Farnsworth,This is an outrage! I demand you hand over your captain's jacket.,725
8142,Leela,This is my normal jacket. I've had it for 10 years.,725
8143,Farnsworth,"I said hand it over!  No, I shouldn't. Because Bender is the new captain!",725
8144,Fry,Bender?,725
8145,Farnsworth,"That's right. Being captain is about intuition and heart. A good captain can't have either one. That's why cold, logical Bender is perfect for the job.",725
8146,Bender,"Well, I do think of human life as expendable.",725
8147,Fry,No fair! Leela was training me to be captain. She even let me sit in her lap and steer -- in this comic I drew.,726
8148,Zoidberg,Ooh! The new one's out!,726
8149,Bender,"Fry, the title of captain may inflate the human ego, but it's beneath the notice of my mighty robo-logic.  Now look spry, men! We launch at six bells!",726
8150,Waterfall Sr.,"Greetings, Econauts. I'm Free Waterfall Sr., founder of Penguins Unlimited.  Please hold your thumbs until the end. Now, folks, it's time to stop that tanker with a non-violent human circle.",727
8151,Leela,Why do we have to resort to non-violence? Can't we just kick their asses?,727
8152,Waterfall Sr.,"Now, little lady, those people's asses are living things too.",727
8153,Bender,"Aye! We're hitched up tighter than Davy Jones' U-Haul! At ease, men.",728
8154,Fry,I am at ease.,728
8155,Bender,"Mr. Fry, I like to give my first mate an informal nickname. From now on you will be known as ... Wiggles!",728
8156,Fry,The hell I will! Have you even read the Captain's Handbook?,728
8157,Bender,I have now. And what's Peter Parrot's first rule of captaining?,728
8158,Fry,Always respect the chain o' command ... captain.,728
8159,Bender,"Correct, Wiggles. You've just earned an invitation to the captain's table",728
8160,Zoidberg,The captain's table! What an honour!,728
8161,Waterfall Sr.,Our peace ring has 'em trapped like a tiger in a washing machine!,729
8162,Leela,Get ready!,729
8163,Protestor #1,Look out!,729
8164,Protestor #2,Hold on!,729
8165,Waterfall Sr.,Here they come!,729
8166,Leela,"When you were planning this peace ring, didn't you realise spaceships can move in three dimensions?",729
8167,Waterfall Sr.,"No, I did not.",729
8168,Waterfall Sr.,"Folks, that tanker gave us the slip, but we'll stop 'em here on Pluto. If you're cold, rub your bodies with permafrost. It's nature's long johns.  If rubbing frozen dirt in your crotch is wrong, hey, I don't wanna be right!",731
8169,Waterfall Sr.,This here is our penguin preserve.,732
8170,Leela,Aw! They're so cute! They're like if puppies and kittens could have babies!,732
8171,Waterfall Sr.,We use hand puppets around the young'uns to simulate a natural environment.,732
8172,Leela,That's adorable!,732
8173,Bender,"But I suppose it's this medal I'm most proud of, Wiggles. I won it for saving the children of Earth from a giant kangaroo. It was on the Australian news, you probably didn't see it.",733
8174,Zoidberg,Brilliant!,733
8175,Fry,"Would you cram a sock in it, Bender? Those aren't even medals, they're bottle-caps and pepperoni slices!",733
8176,Bender,"Thank you, steward. Wiggles, weren't you about to propose a toast to your gallant captain?",733
8177,Fry,"Fine, I've got a toast. To Captain Bender, he's the best ...  ... at being a big jerk who's stupid and his big, ugly face is as dumb as a butt.",733
8178,Bender,"Eh, I've heard better.",733
8179,Fry,If I were in charge I wouldn't treat you like this. You're nothing but a big blowhard.,733
8180,Bender,"Sir, you forget yourself! Shut up!",733
8181,Fry,Being captain is obviously more important to you than being my friend. I'm going.,733
8182,Bender,Going? But a captain can't drink without his first mate.,733
8183,Zoidberg,You can drink with me maybe?,733
8184,Bender,I don't feel like drinking.,733
8185,Zoidberg,"Then, if you'll excuse me, I see some ravioli that only has two shoe prints on it.  Three.",733
8186,Bender,"Oh, Greenland is a barren land,A land that bears no green,Where there's ice and snow,And the whale fishes blow,And the--",734
8187,Zoidberg,"Captain, please, have some liquor. You robots need alcohol to function.",734
8188,Bender,I'm a good captain.,734
8189,Zoidberg,"Please, sir, I love you like a father!",734
8190,Protestor #3,"Here they come. Oh, I hope they read my sign!",735
8191,Leela,Bender's flying too low! And he's upside-down!,735
8192,Protestor #3,He must be talking on a cell phone!,735
8193,Fry,What's happening?,735
8194,Zoidberg,"All 6,000 hulls have been breached!",735
8195,Fry,"Oh, the fools! If only they'd built it with 6,001 hulls! When will they learn?",735
8196,Linda,story. The crisis on Pluto worsens as dark matter spreads throughout the penguin habitat. The images are truly horrific.,736
8197,Leela,"I don't think any of us can understand how those poor, oil-drenched penguins feel.",736
8198,Morbo,"At the time of the crash, the tanker captain had an alcohol level of .08 percent -- well below the legal limit for robots.",736
8199,Hyper-Chicken,"Son, as your lawyer, I declare y'all are in a 12-piece bucket o' trouble. But I done struck you a deal",736
8200,Bender,"Five hours? Aw, man! Couldn't you just got me the death penalty?",736
8201,Hyper-Chicken,I'd have done better but it's plum hard pleadin' a case while awaitin' trial for that there incompetence!,736
8202,Bender,"Yeah, uh, good luck with that.",736
8203,Leela,Now you stay away from those puffin twins.,738
8204,Waterfall Sr.,"Good way to avoid frostbite, folks",738
8205,Leela,Uh ... I think I'll go check on Bender.,738
8206,Waterfall Sr.,Watch that he doesn't pick your pocket.,738
8207,Bender,"Ah, can't beat fresh-squeezed!",738
8208,Leela,"Bender, can you at least pretend you're being punished?  And clean the black parts too.",738
8209,Smitty,Are they black with white feathers or white with black feathers?,738
8210,URL,"It don't matter, baby, they're all beautiful!",738
8211,Bender,"Yo, screws, more Tegrin over here?  Oh, ho! What's this?",738
8212,URL,"Aw, man! He got away!",738
8213,Smitty,I guess this is why Chief says no hugging.,738
8214,Waterfall Sr.,"Good work, everyone. I suggest you all go get some sleep. Me, well, I'm gonna stay up all night singing songs about penguins in a fine, piercing tenor.",738
8215,Leela,"Has anyone seen Bender?  Here robot, robot, robot.",738
8216,Leela,"Hey, why weren't you Kong donkeys outside cleaning up?",739
8217,Zoidberg,They sent us inside for doing an unsatisfactory job.  And eating penguin eggs.,739
8218,Fry,"You ate most of them. So, where's Captain Bender? Off catastrophising some other planet?",739
8219,Zoidberg,"Damnit, Fry! He may have done wrong, but he's still your captain.",739
8220,Leela,I'm worried about him. He didn't come back with the group.,739
8221,Fry,He didn't?,739
8222,Leela,"No, and with wind-chill it's 20 degrees below absolute zero. I'd better go find him.",739
8223,Fry,"Wait. Let me. Bender and I have our disagreements, but we're still friends and I'm gonna show him what that means.  To the ship.",739
8224,Leela,Why don't you just walk? He was only about 20 yards from here.,739
8225,Fry,"Madam, I am in command now.",739
8226,Zoidberg,"Such a man! I'd follow him to hell and back, I would.",739
8227,Bender,"What the--?  What's this water made of, ice? Forget this!",741
8228,[Time Lapse. Bender re-boots. His eyes open and his system scans the local lifeforms. He resets to penguin mode and loads the penguin language. Tasks,1) Acquire Food. 2) Frolic. He stands up and looks around.],741
8229,Penguin #1,Full of fish?,741
8230,Bender,Not entirely.,741
8231,Penguin #1,Then let's fish.,741
8232,Zoidberg,"Captain, I don't think we're on Pluto any longer. In fact, we may have left space as we know it.",742
8233,Fry,Then where are we? You said you knew how to navigate.,742
8234,Zoidberg,Stop yelling at me!,742
8235,Waterfall Sr.,"Folks, it's worse than we thought. Seems dark matter is nature's sex drug. It's like a perverted trail mix of penguin oestrogen, penguin Viagra and Spanish penguin fly. Why, it's making them ultra-fertile.",744
8236,Leela,How ultra?,744
8237,Waterfall Sr.,"Well your garden variety penguin lays one egg a year. Since the spill our penguins have been laying six eggs every 15 minutes.  Also, the males are laying eggs.",744
8238,Doctor,This man is over-gasped.,744
8239,Waterfall Sr.,If the birds keep multiplying there'll soon be too many to count.  Before long the penguins will exhaust their food supply and starve to death.,744
8240,Leela,"Oh, if only we hadn't flown penguins to Pluto and dumped oil on them, this might never have happened. Can't we stop them from multiplying?",744
8241,Waterfall Sr.,"Yes, I reckon it is our responsibility. And thankfully we have a plan.",744
8242,Leela,What is it? We'll do anything.,744
8243,Waterfall Sr.,"Everyone, grab your guns. I declare penguin hunting season officially open.",744
8244,Leela,You can't shoot penguins. Isn't there some way to keep them from breeding?,745
8245,Waterfall Sr.,"Cold showers don't work on Antarctic creatures. Now surely you agree that a quick, semi-painless death is a damn sight better than weeks of starvation.",745
8246,Leela,"Well, I suppose... But-- I mean-- I joined Penguins Unlimited to love penguins, not to hunt them.",745
8247,Waterfall Sr.,This time the two are one and the same! Now are you with us or are you gonna let innocent penguins suffer?,745
8248,Leela,"Oh, God! It's inhuman! It's like Hong Kong! I'll do it!",745
8249,Waterfall Sr.,That's a good old-fashioned gun. Simple point-and-click interface. Rifle check!,746
8250,Hunter #1,"Oh, yeah!",746
8251,Hunter #2,Wee doggy!,746
8252,Leela,"Hey, you're enjoying this.",746
8253,Waterfall Sr.,"Look, nobody enjoys shooting penguins. But if you have to shoot penguins, well, you might as well enjoy it.",746
8254,Leela,"I'm sorry, but if it's fun in any way it's not environmentalism.",746
8255,Waterfall Sr.,"Oh, really? How 'bout blowing up dams?",746
8256,Leela,Yeah ... that is fun.,746
8257,Waterfall Sr.,Let's conservate!,746
8258,Zoidberg,"It's been an honour to serve under you, sir!",747
8259,Leela,"Alright, this is for their own good. Don't leave orphans. Gotta kill entire families.  What's going on? Were you hiding out with these little guys?",748
8260,Bender,Of course not. Filthy ice rats! Scat! Shoo!  Gah! What are you doing? Get away!,748
8261,Leela,Aw! They love you!,748
8262,Bender,"Well I don't love them.  I don't know why but when I look down at their little faces, it makes me wanna puke! In a good way!",748
8263,Penguins,Stand still. It's our only hope.,748
8264,Bender,That's puffin talk. Now follow me!,748
8265,Leela,"Stop! Stop shooting! It's me, Leela.",748
8266,Hunter #2,Sorry.,748
8267,Waterfall Sr.,"Why aren't you firing randomly into those birds, little lady? Don't you wanna help 'em?",748
8268,Leela,Not this way.,748
8269,Waterfall Sr.,What? Why you're not a tree-hugging kook at all!,748
8270,Leela,"Look, I don't know if shooting penguins will help the environment or not. But I do know the decision shouldn't be in the hands of people who just wanna kill for fun.",748
8271,Waterfall Sr.,"Leela, you may just be farming some free-range truth there.  On the other hand, we already made up 200 pounds of batter for penguin tempura. OK, boys, it's them or us!",748
8272,Leela,No!,748
8273,Waterfall Sr.,Hey! Where'd they--,748
8274,Bender,Attack!,748
8275,Hunter #1,Whoa!,748
8276,Hunter #2,Ow!,748
8277,Bender,We will fight them on the beaches! We will fight them on the glaciers!,748
8278,Waterfall Sr.,Make sure they use every part of my body!,748
8279,Old Man Waterfall,"I'll avenge your death, son!",748
8280,Leela,They used to be such peaceful birds. I suppose this was your doing.,748
8281,Bender,Yep. It's like I taught 'em,748
8282,Leela,"Oh, if only we had a toboggan.",748
8283,Bender,Faster! Faster!,748
8284,Leela,Phew!,748
8285,Bender,"Oh, phew!  Oh, right, they can swim. It's all coming back to me now.",748
8286,Leela,It's Fry!,748
8287,Bender,Wiggles?,748
8288,Leela,"Well, at least it'll help reduce their population.",748
8289,Bender,"Yeah, life is hilariously cruel.  Permission to come aboard, Wiggles?",748
8290,Fry,Granted. We can't take off without our captain.,748
8291,Bender,"Oh, and bring my toboggan.",748
8292,Fry,"So, Leela, were you able to help the penguins?",749
8293,Leela,"Well, sure. I mean ... not really. I mean ... nature will work itself out. It can't screw things up any worse than we did trying to fix things, right?",749
8294,Fry,I 'unno.,749
8295,Bender,"Ah, quit your worrying. Thanks to my shining influence those stupid birds'll do just fine.",749
8296,Leela,Guidance system?,750
8297,Bender,Online.,750
8298,Leela,Autopilot?,750
8299,Autopilot,Present.,750
8300,Leela,Dark matter indicator?,750
8301,Fry,Making the noise.,750
8302,Leela,All systems operational. Let's rock!,750
8303,Leela,"Gentlemen, I've completed my report on the crash.",751
8304,Bender,Whoa! I'm not reading that crap. Summarise it in one word.,751
8305,Leela,"Sabotage.  This is a normal L-unit. Without it, space travel is but the fevered dream of a madman.",751
8306,Fry,Yep.,751
8307,Bender,Of course.,751
8308,Zoidberg,Doy!,751
8309,Hermes,It's an important unit.,751
8310,Leela,"And this, my friends, is the L-unit I just removed from the ship.",751
8311,Fry,"That doesn't look like an ""L"" at all. Unless you count lowercase.",751
8312,Bender,You know we don't!,751
8313,Leela,Whoever did this was strong. This is 340 pounds of Tonka-tough steel.,751
8314,Bender,Hmm. It should look like this.  But instead it looks like this.,751
8315,Fry,Who would do a thing like that?,751
8316,Bender,"Who could do a thing like that? And by ""that"", I mean this.",751
8317,Zoidberg,"Well, gang, it looks like we have another mystery on our hands.",751
8318,Hermes,I'd better make a chart of the suspects. I'll begin by drawing a line with my straight-edge.  Sweet lamprey of Santa Fe! My edge has been bent!,751
8319,Amy,Now we'll never beat Jupiter State.,751
8320,Zoidberg,"My slinky!  My cuddly, little pet slinky!",751
8321,Farnsworth,What's all the hubbub?,751
8322,Leela,My God! Even the Professor's been bent.,751
8323,Farnsworth,"That you for your sympathy, talking square of linoleum.",751
8324,Bender,I'll get you fixed up.  That's fine.,751
8325,Amy,"Wait a minute. Bender, what did you just do to the Professor?",751
8326,Bender,I bent him.,751
8327,Amy,Aha!,751
8328,Hermes,Bender!,751
8329,Zoidberg,J'accuse!,751
8330,Bender,"Oh, I see. A bunch of stuff gets bent so it must be the robot designed for bending.",751
8331,Hermes,I know how to settle this,751
8332,Fry,Huh?,751
8333,Amy,What tapes?,751
8334,Leela,Surveillance?,751
8335,Zoidberg,You've seen me naked?,751
8336,Hermes,Ah. Last night's tape. It was right next to Bathroom Bloopers 4.,752
8337,Bender,"See? Nothing. Told you, losers.",752
8338,Fry,Wait! There on the screen. It's that guy you are.,752
8339,Bender,I'm sleepwalking.,752
8340,Farnsworth,Dear God! We've got robots on the ceiling.,752
8341,Fry,"You weren't sleepwalking, you were sleep-bending!",752
8342,Bender,"This is quite a shock. On the other hand, it's not surprising in the least. After all, I've been bending since the day I was built.",752
8343,Bender,I was born on an assembly line in the bad part of Tijuana.,752
8344,Bender,"Mama.  Hooray! I graduated! Time to bend around Europe for a few months, then get a job bending.",752
8345,Amy,You remember your own birth?,752
8346,Bender,Sure. It was only four years ago.,752
8347,Fry,You're only four years old?,752
8348,Bender,"Precocious little scamp, ain't I?",752
8349,Leela,Hmm. Bender must have a pent-up need to bend that's not being satisfied by his bend-free lifestyle.,752
8350,Farnsworth,Then he can't stay here. He's a menace to every straight person in the company.  Go satisfy your bend lust and don't you come back to work until you do.,752
8351,Robots,"No more bending, no more work. Give us a raise, you big fat jerk.",752
8352,Sal,Nevers!,752
8353,Joey,Yo! The Mafia supports you. But don't tell no one. Spread the word.,752
8354,Donbot,"As the duly-elected mobsters of this union, it's our duty to support the struggle of these proud, lazy slobs.",752
8355,Joey,"Yeah, but what if management remains intragnizent?",752
8356,Donbot,"From the context it is clear what you mean. In that case, Clamps may have a little surprise for them.",752
8357,Clamps,The clamps!  Right?,752
8358,Bender,"Aw, no! A strike? Now I'll never get to bend anything. Oh, woe is Bender.",753
8359,Robot #1,"Hang tough, brother. Management refused our demand to switch casual Friday to Monday.",753
8360,Bender,What?,753
8361,Robot #2,And now they're hiring scabs at ten-times the normal wage.,753
8362,Bender,Ten-times normal wage?  I'll give those jerks what for!,753
8363,Sal,"Welcomes aboard, scab.",754
8364,Bender,Great to be here.,754
8365,Sal,Come on. I'll introduces you to your scab co-workers you'll be scabbing with.  This here's our scab foreman.,754
8366,Bender,Flexo?,754
8367,Flexo,Bender?,754
8368,Bender,"Hey, sorry you got sent to that South American Turkish prison instead of me on account of mistaken identity.",754
8369,Flexo,"You bastard! They treated me like an animal and that's what I became!  Nah, you're alright. Good to see you, buddy!",754
8370,Sal,"And here's another scab what also works here, Angle-ine.",754
8371,Bender,Hello.,754
8372,Sal,"Hey, yous guyses wanna move that things?",754
8373,Bender,Hello!,754
8374,Robots,"Give us a raise, you big fat jerk.",755
8375,Sal,Nevers!,755
8376,Bender,"Ow!  Um, hi, Angle-ine. Whatcha up to?",755
8377,Angle-ine,Making hangers. Guidance counsellor said I had a knack for it.,755
8378,Bender,"That's cool, that's cool. So, um, uh, I was wondering if, y'know, it's cool if not, but, what are you doing after work?",755
8379,Angle-ine,What I always do. Jack squat.,755
8380,Bender,"Me too.  Man, we have a lot in common, huh?",755
8381,Angle-ine,Well we are made of virtually identical components.,755
8382,Bender,Are you sure? Maybe I should sneak a peek at your access panel.,755
8383,Angle-ine,"Hey, according to the scab handbook that's extremely inappropriate banter.  And that's just the way I like it.",755
8384,Hermes,Haile H. Selassie!,756
8385,Zoidberg,"There, little friend. Good as new.",756
8386,Farnsworth,"What an exquisite day. That azure sky, the verdant treetops.  Those delightful birds with their chirp, chirp, chirp and their tweet, tweet, splat.",757
8387,Fry,"Professor, I've never seen you so cheerful. What the hell's wrong with you?",757
8388,Farnsworth,"Hmm. I'm not quite sure. Perhaps seeing things from a new perspective has reminded me of life's beauty. Or perhaps my new posture is causing blood to pool in the back of my brain, resulting in a mild delirium. Incidentally, you have a dime up your nose.",757
8389,Fry,I wish! It's a nickel.,757
8390,Bender,Union forever! Lousy scabs! They can't do those things! Et cetera!,758
8391,Bender,I bet watching me bend girders like this turns your legs all rubbery.,759
8392,Angle-ine,"Well my legs are made of rubber.  And anyway, I am just as strong as you are, Mac.",759
8393,Bender,"Oh, yeah?  Here, let me help you.",759
8394,[Montage,Bender and Angle-ine date to American Breed's,759
8395,Farnsworth,My new bent outlook has completely re-energised me. I'm even dating a young Brazilian retired actress.,760
8396,Fry,Alright!,760
8397,Farnsworth,Some say I'm robbing the cradle but I say she's robbing the grave.,760
8398,Bender,"Howdy, doodies. What's new?",760
8399,Farnsworth,"I was just regaling your former co-workers with a tale of bedroom antics, the likes of which--",760
8400,Bender,"Yeah, yeah! Big whoop! No one cares. I got Bender-related news. I'm in love and I'm taking all my friends out to celebrate.",760
8401,Amy,Let's get liquored up!,760
8402,Elzar,"Hey, look at this crowd. You guys gotta try the pasta. It's got a real nice profit margin. Bam! So, special occasion tonight?",761
8403,Bender,"Oh, Elzar, you'll never guess what's happened?",761
8404,Elzar,Bam?,761
8405,Bender,I met the most dynamite ladybot.,761
8406,Elzar,"Hey, that's terrific. To celebrate, I'm gonna stick seven copies of my latest cookbook on your bill.",761
8407,Bender,"Bless you, sir.",761
8408,Farnsworth,"So, Bender, tell us about this new girlfriend of yours.",761
8409,Bender,"I intend to. Through the lost art of the toast.  To Angle-ine, she's got it all. Looks, charm and the love of a fabulous bending robot.",761
8410,Fry,She sure does.,761
8411,Bender,Flexo!,761
8412,Elzar,"Careful, that's a week old!",761
8413,Bender,"I finally meet a nice girl with a pair of legs that don't quit unexpectedly and that jerk Flexo steals her away? It's time to kick some shiny, metal ass.  You degenerate hussy! I'm disappointed in you too, Angle-ine.",761
8414,Angle-ine,"Bender, it's-it's not what you think.",761
8415,Bender,"Oh, God! Then it's worse than I think.",761
8416,Angle-ine,"Now, look, there is no reason to be upset. Flexo and I are divorced.",761
8417,Bender,Div-- Huh?,761
8418,Flexo,We're just havin' dinner 'cause we wanna stay friends.,761
8419,Bender,"Uh, I knew that. What I'm actually outraged by is your choice of wine. Really, it's the steward's fault.",761
8420,Steward,"Excellent choice, sir.",761
8421,Bender,"That Flexo, I'm knockin' him right on his butt. I can't believe this.",762
8422,Farnsworth,"Obsessing won't help, Bender. Take a lean back and enjoy life.",762
8423,Bender,I can't. My Fembot may be in love with another Manbot.,762
8424,Leela,Well talk to her. Tell her about your feelings in an open an honest way.,762
8425,Fry,Yeah. Either that or be a man.,762
8426,Bender,"OK, I've constructed an elaborate lie",763
8427,Fry,That's thinkin' like a man.,763
8428,Bender,Hello? This is Flexo.,763
8429,Bender,Now we'll see who loves whom.,764
8430,Bender,"Hey, hot stuff.",764
8431,Angle-ine,"Hey, Flexo.  So since when do you go to bars on work nights? It's not like you at all.",764
8432,Bender,Nonsense. It's exactly like me. Flexo,764
8433,Bartender-bot,Two Fuzzy Navel's comin' up.,764
8434,Bender,I hope they can make change for a fortune.,764
8435,Joey,"Yo. Get an eye-load of that filthy scab with the beard flashing his filthy scab money. It's an insult to you, boss.",764
8436,Donbot,Yeah. That cash oughta be slushin' my fund and kicksing my back.,764
8437,Clamps,I'm greasing up my whoozits!,764
8438,Donbot,"Whoa, whoa, Clamps, not yet. Let's just keep an eye on him and see if he does it a couple more times.",764
8439,Bender,You're lookin' good to Flexo tonight.,764
8440,Angle-ine,Quit makin' with the googly eyes. You know that I'm in love with Bender.,764
8441,Bender,Bender? That walking wuss factory?,764
8442,Angle-ine,"Well he may be a walking factory but believe me he is no wuss. Now, look, you and me are through. I told you that when I divorced you.",764
8443,Bender,"But going through a divorce together, you can't tell me that didn't bring us closer. Care to dance?",764
8444,Angle-ine,You know I love dancing but you always hated it.,764
8445,Bender,"In that case it's something I've always wanted to make up to you.  Hey, scratchmo. How 'bout dropping me and the lady some rump-rattling beats?",764
8446,Donbot,I had hoped that by the second time he flashed his cash my rage would have subsided. Sadly that has not happened.,764
8447,Angle-ine,"You used to be so inflexible, Flexo. You have really loosened up!",764
8448,Bender,I recently upgraded my funk card. C'mon!,764
8449,Angle-ine,Alright!,764
8450,Bender,"C'mon now, what's new!  Ew!",764
8451,Angle-ine,Flexo? What-What's going on?,764
8452,Bender,Um...,764
8453,Angle-ine,Flexo!,764
8454,Bender,So the moral of the story is,764
8455,Angle-ine,"You always were a kick in the teeth, man.",764
8456,Bender,"Aw, shucks, thunder-buns! You make me feel like a million volts.",764
8457,Angle-ine,"Flexo, Flexo, Flexo. I'm starting to remember why I fell for you in the first place.",764
8458,Bender,"So, she's falling for Flexo, eh? I'd better seduce her a little more, just to be sure.",764
8459,Angle-ine,"Well, it's late. I should get home to my trailer.",764
8460,Bender,"I'll walk you out. After all, a true gentleman tends to his date's every need.  Tiparillo?",764
8461,Bender,"Here you are, my lad. Bring the lady's car around in the finest way possible.",765
8462,Joey,He's flashin' his cash loaf again.,765
8463,Donbot,How many times is that? Two or three?,765
8464,Clamps,Three.,765
8465,Donbot,Alright. That's the necessary number of times. That scab's gonna have a little on-the-job accident.,765
8466,Joey,"With all due respect, Donbot, I don't think we should rely on an accident happening. Let's kill him ourselves.",765
8467,'Angle-ine,"Well, goodnight. I-I had a great time.",765
8468,Bender,How 'bout a lift? To your place.,765
8469,Angle-ine,What?,765
8470,Bender,"Admit it. You felt something for me tonight. And by ""me"" I mean Flexo.",765
8471,'Angle-ine,"Hey, look, I had fun, but--",765
8472,Bender,But?,765
8473,'Angle-ine,But--,765
8474,Bender,But?,765
8475,Angle-ine,Huh? Bender! You tricked me.,765
8476,Bender,"That's right, baby. I ain't your lover boy, Flexo, the guy you love so much. You even love anybody pretending to be him.",765
8477,Angle-ine,Well maybe I love you so much I love you no matter who you're pretending to be.,765
8478,Bender,"Oh, how I wish I could believe or understand that! There's only one reasonable course of action now",765
8479,Angle-ine,Nooo!,765
8480,Flexo,"Thanks, I appreciate that.  Nah, I'm joshing you. That was quite annoying.",766
8481,Bender,You call yourself divorced? You're making a mockery of one of our oldest institutions.,766
8482,Flexo,What?,766
8483,Clamps,"Alright, boss, give the word and I'll drop this unbendable girder. Clamp, clamp, ka-bamp!",766
8484,Donbot,"Remember, only kill the one with the beard. That other filthy scab we got nothing against.",766
8485,Flexo,That's low!,766
8486,Angle-ine,Please stop! I'm not worth it!,766
8487,Bender,Probably not. But I love you and I'm gonna kick his ass till I win you back.,766
8488,Donbot,"OK, Clamps. Now!",766
8489,Clamps,"Ooh, that's gotta clamp!",766
8490,Angle-ine,Flexo? Are you OK?,766
8491,Flexo,"Yeah, never better.  Nah, I'm yankin' your chain, I'm dying.",766
8492,Angle-ine,You can't die. Tonight Bender showed me that I love you.,766
8493,Bender,"But, I love you.",766
8494,Angle-ine,I know and I care for you too. But I could never love anyone as much as you made me realise I love Flexo.,766
8495,Bender,"But ... but...  I love you so much, Angle-ine, I want you to be happy no matter what.",766
8496,Angle-ine,"What, what are you saying?",766
8497,Bender,I'm saying I've got an unbendable girder to bend.,766
8498,Angle-ine,You can't bend that girder. It's unbendable!,766
8499,Bender,"Well I don't know anything about lifting, so that just leaves us the one option.",766
8500,Flexo,"Thanks, buddy. Another year under that and I'd have been a goner.",766
8501,Angle-ine,"I'll always remember this, Bender.",766
8502,Bender,Jerk.,766
8503,Leela,"So Flexo and Angle-ine had sex right there on the factory floor? Well, at least you got bending out of your system.",767
8504,Bender,"Yes. I won't be up to bending again for a long, long time.",767
8505,Farnsworth,Perhaps it's your outlook that needs a good bend. A 90-degree bend to a place where happiness is perpendicular to wonderment.,767
8506,Fry,"Professor, we're all sick of your upbeat attitude.",767
8507,Amy,I'll say.,767
8508,Zoidberg,Believe it.,767
8509,Farnsworth,Nonsense. It's just like in the song I wrote,767
8510,Leela,"Bender, you've gotta help us.",767
8511,Bender,I try to get out but they keep pulling me back in.,767
8512,Farnsworth,"You gotta dangle,Have a new angle,Wangle a new dangle on life,",767
8513,Amy,"No, Bender! The other way.",767
8514,Bender,I like him better this way.,767
8515,Farnsworth,I'm sad now.,767
8516,Leela,"Eh, it's fine.",767
8517,Amy,Is Nibbler stoked for the big pet show?,769
8518,Leela,He ought to be with all the strict training I've been putting him through.  You are so adorable! Who wants a ham?,769
8519,Farnsworth,Zooka barooka! First prize is $500 and a year's supply of dog food!,769
8520,Bender,"""$500"", you say?",769
8521,Zoidberg,"""Dog food"", you say?",769
8522,Fry,"Man, that's dog's gonna be hard to beat. Look at him bring in the sheep! One sheep, two sheep ...  ... three sheep.",769
8523,Leela,"The dog's good, but our real competition is the Hypno-Toad.  Your turn, Nibbler, honey. Herd those sheep!",769
8524,Amy,"Come on, Nibbler!",769
8525,Bender,"Ma'am, I have a late entry",769
8526,Bender,Faster! Faster.,769
8527,Zoidberg,Ow!,769
8528,Bender,Suck in that gut! You wanna be spayed?,769
8529,Bender,"Silence, you cur! Puff out that brisket!",769
8530,Bender,I should be weeping! I'm not weeping!,769
8531,Fry,I love these things!,769
8532,Leela,"Shake paws, Nibbler. Come on, shake.  He might be a little hungry. Shake, boy. Usually he's had more ham by now. Shake!",769
8533,Judge #1,"Third prize, a party-sized keg of guinea pigs, goes to Dave Spiegel and his owner, Fluffers.  Second prize, this lovely afghan made from an Afghan, goes to Bender and his wooping terrier.",769
8534,Bender,Second place?  You didn't stick your landing!,769
8535,Zoidberg,"Forgive me, my friend.",769
8536,Bender,Never!,769
8537,Judge #1,And before we announce the winner we have a special award for a first-time contestant,769
8538,Leela,Me? Award? Him? Me? Good?,769
8539,Judge #1,That's just the kind of eloquence you'd expect from the owner of Dumbest Pet in Show.  All glory to the Hypno-Toad.,769
8540,Leela,Maybe they're right. Maybe Nibbler is dumb.,770
8541,Fry,"Don't listen to them, Leela. People said I was dumb, but I proved them.",770
8542,Farnsworth,"Good news, everyone! We were supposed to make a delivery to the planet Tweenis 12 but it's been completely destroyed.",770
8543,Leela,Why is that good news?,770
8544,Farnsworth,They paid in advance.,770
8545,Bender,Excuse me.,770
8546,Hermes,"This is mighty strange.  First, the civilisation of Space Rome collapsed, then Don Martin 3 went kaflooie and now Tweenis 12.",770
8547,Fry,Looks like this planet is next in line.,770
8548,Leela,That's Earth.  The planet we live on.,770
8549,Fry,I'd hate to be those guys.,770
8550,Hermes,"What's got into him? He's twitching like Zoidberg when someone mentions the word ""food"".",770
8551,Zoidberg,"What, now?",770
8552,Leela,"No! Nibbler, come back!",770
8553,Leela,"Too bad Nibbler's not around. I guess I'll have to eat this raw, dripping ham by myself.  Uh, Nibbler? Could you scooch the seat up just a little bit?",771
8554,Fry,Leela back yet?,772
8555,Bender,"Fry, help me! My heart stopped beating!",772
8556,Fry,You don't have a heart; you're a robot.,772
8557,Bender,"Sure ... right. Robot!  Oh, Fry! My skin's all dry and clanky.",772
8558,Fry,"Well, yeah. Robots are made of metal.",772
8559,Bender,Am I a robot?,772
8560,Fry,"Bender, if this is some kind of scam, I don't get it. You already have my power of attorney.",772
8561,Bender,Fry!  My skin!,772
8562,Farnsworth,Ow. Ow. Ow.  I'm a genius. Ow. Ow.,773
8563,Fry,"Dr. Zoidberg, why is everyone acting so weird?",774
8564,Zoidberg,Zoidy want balloon! Want balloon now!  Zoidy want go outside!,774
8565,Fry,I just let you back in!,774
8566,Leela,This is unbelievable. I thought you were a furry little moron. But here you are flying an adorable spaceship. If only you could talk.  So every religion is wrong!,775
8567,Linda,"""I'm sending in more trains!""",776
8568,Woman,Go!,776
8569,Man,Wait for me! Wait for me!,776
8570,Morbo,Morbo can't understand his TelePrompTer. He forgot how you say that letter that looks like a man with a hat.,776
8571,Linda,"It's a ""T"". It goes ""tuh"".",776
8572,Morbo,"Hello, little man. I will destroy you!",776
8573,Fry,"Man, even the news monster is acting strange. What are we gonna do?",776
8574,Farnsworth,"Duh, I know! Let's play the lottery!",776
8575,Amy,No. Let's buy Internet stock!,776
8576,Zoidberg,On margin! Zoidy wanna buy on margin!,776
8577,Hermes,Look at me! I'm invisible!,776
8578,Fry,Wait a minute! I know what's going on here. You've all become idiots!,776
8579,Bender,"Hey, let's all join the Reform Party!",776
8580,Hermes,"Oh, yeah!",776
8581,Ken,"Welcome back, Lord Nibbler, Ambassador to Earth, homeworld of the pizza bagel.",778
8582,Nibbler,Thank you. I bear many receipts for reimbursement.,778
8583,Fiona,"The four welcomes of friendship to you as well, Leela. We shall manipulate your mind so we appear to be speaking your language. Do not be afraid, my child.",778
8584,Leela,I'm not afraid.,778
8585,Fiona,"Uh, good. Good.",778
8586,Leela,"So, your real name is Lord Nibbler? That's a coincidence.",778
8587,Nibbler,"That name is for your sake. In the time it would take to pronounce one letter of my true name, a trillion cosmoses would flair into existence and sink into eternal night.",778
8588,Leela,"Oh, you're all so cute!",778
8589,Ken,"No, we're not.  When the universe was forged in the crucible of the Big Bang, our mighty race was already 17 years old.",778
8590,Leela,Aww!,778
8591,Ken,"For the first millisecond of time, things were OK. But then there arose a terrible enemy",778
8592,Nibblonian Chef,Lunch is ready.,778
8593,Ken,Then let the feast of a thousand hams begin.,778
8594,Leela,"So why are these Brain Spawn attacking Earth, Nibbler?",778
8595,Nibbler,The Brain Spawn hate all consciousness. The thoughts of others screech at them like the forced laughs of a billion art house movie patrons.,778
8596,Ken,"Thus, they travel from world to world making everyone stupid in order to wipe out all thought in the universe.",778
8597,Leela,Wipe out all thought? My God! They're like flying televisions.,778
8598,Fiona,"And even we are powerless to stop them, fearsome though we are.",778
8599,Nibbler,"There is but one being who can resist them. A child of destiny whose bizarre brain wave pattern makes him immune to the Brain Spawn attack.  The fate of your world, perhaps all worlds, rests in his special mind.",778
8600,Leela,"Now, when you say ""special""...",778
8601,Fry,"Attention, New New Yorkers. Stop acting so stupid!",779
8602,Ken,"Nibblonian fleet holding at perimeter of moron zone, formerly known as ""Earth"".",780
8603,Leela,Why would Fry be immune to the flying brains? Because he doesn't shower?,780
8604,Fiona,"The Brain Spawn suppress intelligence by attacking the delta brain wave. Every animal and robot in the universe generates this wave, as do certain trees.",780
8605,Nibbler,"Fry, however, does not.",780
8606,Fiona,Somehow he has cobbled together a random assortment of other brain waves into a working mind.,780
8607,Leela,Like a prom dress made from carpet remnants.,780
8608,Nibbler,"Yes, like your prom dress.",780
8609,Ken,"The Brain Spawn are commanded by a giant, evil brain with a gooey centre of pure hate.",780
8610,Fiona,"Only Fry, with his superior, yet inferior mind, can approach him. You must tell him to disable it. We will do the rest.",780
8611,Leela,You can count on me.,780
8612,Fiona,"No, we can't. Once on Earth, you will be too stupid to remember the message.",780
8613,Nibbler,That's why we wrote it down for you.,780
8614,Ken,We've also prepared a bag lunch and some mittens.,780
8615,Fry,Time to re-educate you dunce-bags. We'll start with US presidents.  Let's review. Who was our first president?,781
8616,Amy,Um.,781
8617,Bender,A pickle jar?,781
8618,Washington,Thomas Jefferson?,781
8619,Fry,Leela! I've been so worried. Are you a bonehead?,781
8620,Leela,I ... have to tell ... must ... important ... something--,781
8621,Fry,"Whoa, whoa! Slow down. You're going a mile a minute.",781
8622,Leela,This! You for this!,781
8623,Fry,Thanks!,781
8624,Leela,No!  Ow! Fire hot.,781
8625,Farnsworth,The professy will help!  Fire indeed hot!,781
8626,Arthur,Oh! Chester A. Arthur fall down.,781
8627,Leela,Brain. Brain make people dumb.,781
8628,Fry,"No, Leela. Brain make people smart.",781
8629,Leela,You go fight biggest brain of all.,781
8630,Fry,Even bigger than those? Holy nuts! Where is it?,781
8631,Leela,I 'unno!,781
8632,Fry,Hm. A giant brain is basically a giant nerd. And where would a giant nerd be?  The libary!,781
8633,Big Brain,"Pathetic human race. Arranging their knowledge by category just made it easier to absorb. Dewey, you fool, your decimal system has played right into my hands!  What do you want?",783
8634,Fry,I'm here to kick your ass.,783
8635,Big Brain,Wishful thinking. We have long since evolved beyond the need for asses.  Odd. My stupefaction field is having no effect on your ability to think.,783
8636,Fry,That's right. And I think you'll find that a little knowledge is a dangerous thing!  Thinking ... thinking...,783
8637,Big Brain,Oh! Stop that!,783
8638,Fry,"Hey! Thinking hurts him. Maybe I can think of a way to use that.  Aha! Prepare to be thought at. Leela, give me a topic.",783
8639,Leela,Duh...,783
8640,Fry,"Seriously, I can't think of anything.  Gotta find something to make me think. Hardy Boys, too easy. Nancy Drew, too hard. Aha! Perfect! Bonfire of the Vanities!",783
8641,Big Brain,No! It's unbearable!,783
8642,Fiona,The brains are weakening.  Nibblonians to Nibble stations. Prepare cuddle bug for deployment in 40 nibblets.,783
8643,Nibbler,Sometimes I fear we are cute.,783
8644,Fiona,"Oh, niggle-snoosh!",783
8645,Fry,Take that! And that! This sentence I don't understand but take this one!,784
8646,Big Brain,You have not won yet.  Each book in this room is a gateway to a mental realm and I shall take you there and imprison you forever.,784

8696,Zoidberg,So these three parasitic worms bore into a human's head--,788
8697,Woman #1,"Ew, gross.",788
8698,Zoidberg,"And they walk up to the bar and then-- Uh-oh.  Wait, stop! I've got more!",788
8699,Zoidberg,My whole life I worked on that act. And they hated it.,789
8700,Hermes,"You're a crazy, penniless, lobster doctor. No combination of you should be a comedian.",789
8701,Zoidberg,But comedy is in my valves. My Uncle Harold was a big Hollywood star back in the era of silent holograms.,789
8702,Leela,Your uncle was Harold Zoid?,789
8703,Zoidberg,This I cannot deny.,789
8704,Farnsworth,"Why, I've been a Harold Zoid fan since back when my hips were made of bone. As it happens, I still have some of my original 78s.",789
8705,Hermes,"You're right, crabby. He's a hell of a lot funnier than you could ever be.",789
8706,Zoidberg,"Maybe so, but perhaps if I wrote him and asked for a few hundred pointers...",789
8707,Zoidberg,"This letter has to be very personal, so I'm writing it in my own ink.  Dear Uncle Zoid, greetings from your long-lost nephew. Norm and Sam and Sadie's boy, remember?",790
8708,Zoidberg,"Now I am the most important doctor at the delivery company where I work. But, sadly, my life is bereft of laughter.",790
8709,Zoid,"Oy, isn't that nice? He took the time.",790
8710,Woman #2,What's that scribbledy-gook?,790
8711,Zoid,"This is a fan letter from my rich doctor nephew, who just might be my ticket out of this flophouse, he might.  Dear Rich Doctor Nephew, I can help you be funny. The first funny thing you must do is put all your money in the form of a cashier's check and come to Hollywood.",790
8712,Zoidberg,Did you hear that? I'm going to Hollywood!,791
8713,Tour Guide,"Welcome to Hollywood! I must warn you, there's no refund if you get discovered and leave the tour!  Fox uses those searchlights to blind pilots, then film the resulting plane crashes.",793
8714,Bender,Neat!,793
8715,Tour Guide,"Ahead, you'll see the home of Mel Gibson, star of the hit film, Bravehead.  And do we have any fans of Calculon, star of the robot soap opera All My Circuits?",793
8716,Bender,Oh! I am! Me!  Bender is!,793
8717,Tour Guide,Then you'll wanna get a close look at his luxurious Bel-Air home.,793
8718,Bender,"Yes, I will.",793
8719,Calculon,Are you my new hot water heater?,793
8720,Bender,"No, I'm Bender. We met once, remember?",793
8721,Calculon,Absolutely not.,793
8722,Bender,"Come on, don't you remember how much I was bugging you, don't you? 'Cause it was a lot, you remember, right?",793
8723,Calculon,"Look, I'm programmed to be very busy. Unless you can heat water to 212 degrees, I'm not interested.  Have you got an extra GOTO 10 line? I said I don't need a bender.",793
8724,Bender,Bender? That was the other guy. My name's Boiler.,793
8725,Calculon,"Nice work, Boiler.",794
8726,Bender,Thanks. And call me Bender.,794
8727,Zoidberg,"That's where I'm meeting Uncle Zoid for lunch to discuss my Hollywood dreams. Next time you see me, don't be surprised if I've eaten.",795
8728,Zoidberg,"Uncle Zoid, you're looking young enough to be thrown back!",795
8729,Zoid,"Rich nephew, come over here and give your uncle a nice, big meal.  So, here we are",795
8730,Zoidberg,"And a rich, respected doctor with many surviving patients.",795
8731,Zoid,"Eating real food in a restaurant, as we both often do. So, you want to be a comedian, is it?",795
8732,Zoidberg,It's my lifelong dream.,795
8733,Zoid,You're unfunny and untalented. That's why you're perfect for drama.,795
8734,Zoidberg,Hmm. Serious drama. Perhaps it is time to give up comedy.,795
8735,Zoid,"I'm putting together a big drama picture right now, as we speak. The script is dynamite. I know because I wrote it myself. And with me directing and starring, I'll be back on top after 50 miserable years--  Uh, of fame.",795
8736,Zoidberg,"Ah, fame. Where do I come in?",795
8737,Zoid,"This fame film has a juicy part for you, if you completely finance it with your doctor money. So, are you in?",795
8738,Zoidberg,"Uh, OK. How much do I have to invest?",795
8739,Zoid,"Oh, not much, not much,  Then it's settled. Another blockbuster Hollywood deal.",795
8740,Waiter,What can I get you gentlemen?,795
8741,Zoidberg,Is bread free?,795
8742,Waiter,Yeah.,795
8743,Zoidberg,We'll split an order.,795
8744,Bender,What's with Monstro?,796
8745,Fry,He promised he'd give his Uncle Zoid a million bucks to make a movie.,796
8746,Zoidberg,I've only been here a day and already I'm a Hollywood phoney.,796
8747,Bender,"Well, perhaps I could call on TV's Calculon to help, now that I'm in showbiz.",796
8748,Fry,Since when have you been in the biz?,796
8749,Bender,"Long enough, little man. Long enough.",796
8750,[Scene,Outside,797
8751,Bender,"Calculon, as your hot water heater ...  ... I would be remiss if I didn't bring you scripts that could make you an international film star.",798
8752,Calculon,Of course. Tell me about the project.,798
8753,Zoidberg,It's a movie.,798
8754,Calculon,Interesting. Tell me more.,798
8755,Bender,Get this,798
8756,Calculon,And?,798
8757,Bender,"And, uh, I guarantee it'll win you an Oscar.",798
8758,Calculon,"An Oscar, you say? That would get me out of this festering rat's nest called ""television"" once and for all. Let me see the script.  Wait! Harold Zoid? Was this written by the Harold Zoid?",798
8759,Zoidberg,Written and Xeroxed.,798
8760,Calculon,Good heavens! A chance to work with the legendary Harold Zoid. He's one of my great idols. And-And you say you can guarantee me the Oscar?,798
8761,Bender,I can guarantee anything you want.,798
8762,Calculon,Then I'll do it!,798
8763,Zoidberg,Hooray!,798
8764,Bender,Here's your chequebook.,798
8765,Calculon,"Ladies and gentlemen, I give you our director, the legendary Harold Zoid!",799
8766,Zoid,Thank you. A more classic movie plot there isn't,799
8767,Bender,"That plot makes perfect sense. Wink, wink.",799
8768,Zoidberg,"Bender, you said ""wink, wink"" out loud.",799
8769,Bender,"No, I didn't. Raise middle finger.",799
8770,Zoid,"Now remember, and I can't stress this enough, this is a talkie, so I want the full gamut of emotions from every actor in every scene.",799
8771,Zoidberg,"The Magnificent Three. Scene one, take one.",799
8772,Zoid,"And, action!",799
8773,Calculon,"Take back your gilded pen, Father. Signing bills into law was always your dream, not mine.",799
8774,Zoid,"Cut! Cut! Cut it!  I said this is a talkie, damnit! You've got to emote more! And you extras, wave your arms and make faces. What is this, a morgue?",799
8775,Zoidberg,"The Magnificent Three. Scene 10, take 95.",799
8776,Zoid,Action. And I mean circus-grade action.,799
8777,Calculon,"Sir, I call upon you not as a President but as a father.",799
8778,Zoid,"Cut, cut, cut it!  Throw a pie or two, for God's sake.",799
8779,Calculon,Nooo!,799
8780,Zoid,"Cut, cut it! Eck! Look, look, it's alright, kid. We'll, uh, we'll get it in editing. Alright, that's a wrap, everybody. I'm gonna see you all at the premiere which, by the way, when is?",799
8781,Zoidberg,"Well, editing is a long and expensive process but we spent all the money on pies, so it'll be ready Friday.",799
8782,Bender,"Nice turnout, Calculon. That Oscar's practically on your mantel.",800
8783,Calculon,I just pray they like me half as much as I do.,800

8788,Leela,"No! It's the principle of the thing. Besides, I think I see a parking lot up ahead.",801
8789,Calculon,"Father, I've asked you to join me on the White House roof so we could have a heart-to-heart talk. I will never follow in your footsteps. Here is my resignation as Vice President.",803
8790,Zoid,"No! My son will not shame me like this. I would sooner die, I would!",803

8795,Calculon,Nooo!,803
8796,Bender,Woo-hoo! Yeah! He's a visionary!,803
8797,Calculon,Everyone walked out. They hated it. I've seen plagues that had better opening nights than this. You said that Oscar was practically on my mantel.,803
8798,Bender,"Now you know why I use the qualifier, ""practically"".",803
8799,Calculon,You listen to me. I'm out a million bucks here! You get me that Oscar or you're dead! You and these snivelling lobsters! Dead. You hear me? Dead!,803
8800,Zoid,"Oy, now he emotes!",803
8801,Zoidberg,Let's just hope Calculon breaks our legs; they'll grow back.,803
8802,Zoid,"He's gonna kill us, you klutzel! Who told that under-acting stiff he was going to get an Oscar?",803
8803,Bender,Me. It seemed like the least honest way to get him to pay for the movie.,803
8804,Zoid,"He paid?  I though you paid, with your big-shot doctor money.",803
8805,Zoidberg,I lied.,803
8806,Zoid,"OK, enough with the blubbering, already. The way I directed the hell out of him, he may still very well get the nomination.",803

8811,Calculon,Piffle! That's the Emmy of movie awards!  I told you I want an Oscar.,804
8812,Bender,Then maybe you should act better.,804
8813,Calculon,The Oscar isn't about acting. It's about earning the respect and admiration of the creative community.,804
8814,Zoid,How 'bout we rig the awards?,804
8815,Calculon,That's fine too.,804
8816,Leela,"It's no use. The tar is too thick. Plus, I think I flooded it.",805
8817,Fry,"Well, we missed the premiere and we're gonna die. We might as well enjoy the sights.  Oh, my God! Sylvester Stallone!",805
8818,Zoidberg,This is where you live? I though you were a big-shot Hollywood movie star.,806
8819,Zoid,"No, I'm not. I'm an even bigger liar than you. My career went down the tubes the day they invented smell-a-vision.",806
8820,Bender,Calculon's gonna kill us for sure. It's all everybody else's fault.,806
8821,Zoid,Oy. All I wanted was for people to think of me one last time before I die.,806
8822,Zoidberg,"What are you talking about, Uncle? Everybody remembers Harold Zoid!",806

But tonight I realise what's really important is to win two Oscars. Ha! Ha! I'm kidding, I'm kidding. What really matters in life is that people care about you, whether it's a whole crowd ...  ... or just one die-hard fan.",810

8962,Kids,"Hello, jerkbags!",819
8963,Amy,"Oh, they're so cute! What are their names?",819
8964,Bender,Kids have names?,819
8965,Nina,"My name's Nina, and his name's Albert--",819
8966,Bender,"And from now on, you're all named Bender Jr.!  Lookie here! My first government stipend cheque! 12 baby humans, 1200 wing-wangs!",819
8967,Sally,"Daddy Bender, we're hungry.",819
8968,Bender,"What is it with you kids? Every other day it's food, food, food!  Oh, fine. I'll get you some stupid food.",819
8969,Albert,Can we have Bender burgers again?,819
8970,Bender,No. The cat shelter's on to me!,819
8971,Adlai,"Hello, Leela. I was in a nearby tailor getting one of my Hawai'ian shirts toned down, so I thought I'd drop in for your follow-up exam.",820
8972,Leela,Oh. That's so handsome of you.,820
8973,Adlai,"Just follow the light with your eyes.  As for me, I'm somewhat interested myself.",820
8974,Leela,What are you saying?,820
8975,Adlai,"I've never been good with words, which is why I'm in such a delicate conundrum. Will you go out with me this Sunday?",820
8976,Leela,Sure!,820
8977,Adlai,"I don't know what else to say, so I'll just say it. Okey-dokey, see you then.",820
8978,Fry,This is so unfair! I liked you back when you were a cyclops! That guy's only interested now that you have two eyes.,820
8979,Leela,You're just jealous!,820
8980,Fry,"No, I'm not! Oh, wait, I am. But my point remains valid!",820
8981,Leela,"Fry, I just wanna try dating a normal man, who if you go somewhere with him no one says he's crummy. I think I deserve that once in life.",820
8982,Zoidberg,"Be careful with that Adlai, Leela, he's a doctor, they're very poor.",820
8983,Leela,"Actually, most doctors are rich.",820
8984,Zoidberg,"What? When did this happen? You're joking, right?  That's not funny!",820
8985,Bender,"OK, they've got everything you need here",821
8986,Albert,Yeah.,821
8987,Bender,Then knock yourself out.  Hey! Hey! Only eat and drink enough to barely keep yourselves alive! I'm trying to make a profit here.,821
8988,Nina,Daddy! Bethany's hitting me!,821
8989,Bender,Here.,821
8990,Fembot,These kids yours?,821
8991,Bender,Yeah.,821
8992,Fembot,Ooh. I'm attracted to a man with responsibility!,821
8993,Bender,"That's me, baby! Let me just ditch the kids in an alley and we can go have some fun.",821
8994,Boy,Daddy Bender?,821
8995,Bender,"Son, daddy's trying to score with a cheap floozy right now, so we need you to cram a Tinkertoy in it!",821
8996,Boy,"I love you, Daddy Bender!",821
8997,Bender,"Hey, what the hell are you doing? Quit hugging me!",821
8998,Fembot,I guess you're busy. I'll catch you later.,821
8999,Bender,"You morons! I don't know what you're trying to pull but I got half a mind to hug each and every one of you and see how you like it!  Oh, come on!",821
9000,Adlai,"I thought I'd take you someplace ordinary, a place no one could object to.",822
9001,Leela,That sounds wonderful.,822
9002,Man #4,I'd like an extra-beautiful bouquet for my extra-gorgeous sweetheart.,824
9003,Adlai,"Average, please.",824
9004,Leela,"Oh, Adlai, I've had a wonderful time today. No one's stared at me or avoided staring at me or tried to burn me. You make me feel so not weird.",824
9005,Adlai,"Leela, you're 999,999 in a million!",824
9006,Leela,Thanks for coming out to get to know my boyfriend. Isn't he dreamy?,825
9007,Zoidberg,Totally.,825
9008,Adlai,"Uh, listen. I just want you all to know your Leela's one standard lady.",825
9009,Leela,"Oh, Adlai, stop!",825
9010,Fry,What's so wonderful about Leela being normal? The rest of us aren't normal and that's what makes us great. Like Dr. Zoidberg,825
9011,Zoidberg,Damn right!,825
9012,Fry,"And the Professor's a senile, amoral crackpot.  Hermes is a Rastafarian accountant.",825
9013,Hermes,Tally me banana.,825
9014,Fry,Amy's a klutz from Mars.,825
9015,Amy,Sploops!,825
9016,Farnsworth,"And, Fry, you've got that brain thing.",825
9017,Fry,"I already did! So, Leela, do you wanna be like us? Or do you wanna be like Adlai with no severe mental or social problems whatsoever?",825
9018,Leela,That's the dumbest question I ever heard!,825
9019,Farnsworth,She's right!,825
9020,Zoidberg,No doubt about it.,825
9021,Amy,Duh!,825
9022,Hermes,Daylight come!,825
9023,Bender,"Coming through, watch your heads!",825
9024,Zoidberg,Help! I'm under attack!,825
9025,Bender,"Remember your manners, kids. Forks go in the left pocket, spoons in the right.",825
9026,Elzar,Which one of you cutie muffins gets the children's spicy squab?,825
9027,Sam,Me!,825
9028,Bender,Ah-ah-ah! What do we say when someone gives you something?,825
9029,Sam,'Bout time!,825
9030,Bender,That's my boy!,825
9031,Elzar,And here's your check. Bam!,825
9032,Albert,I gotta go poopy!,825
9033,Bender,"Well you should've gone poopy before it was time to run out on the check! C'mon! Go, go! Through the kitchen!",825
9034,Elzar,You little crooks! If I catch you I'm going to make cutie-muffin gumbo!,825
9035,Adlai,"You know, seeing that strange robot force 12 children to do his bidding makes me think about kids of our own.",825
9036,Leela,Us? Me? You? Kids?,825
9037,Adlai,"That's correct. It's time to stop living this vida bachelor loca, settle down and have kids.",825
9038,Leela,"Oh, Adlai, this is the most beautiful moment of my life!",825
9039,Albert,"Daddy Bender, I want a piggy back ride.",826
9040,Bender,Daddy's tired. Let's just have another dog-pile on Fry.,826
9041,Sally,"Tell us a story, Daddy Bender.",826
9042,Kids,Story! Story! Story!,826
9043,Bender,"Alright, fine, gather round.",826
9044,Nina,We wanna hear this one again!,826
9045,Bender,"""Bender's Arrest Record"" by the police. On March 3rd at 2pm, Bender was caught shoplifting.",826
9046,Albert,"Yeah, show us the picture!  There he is!",826
9047,Bender,"OK, kids. It's 9.00, you know what that means. Daddy's sick of looking at you so go to bed.  The grown-ups have to talk. Come on, Ma.",826
9048,Bender,Now to figure out how much money I'm raking in off those twerps!  Oh! I need a calculator.,826
9049,Fry,You are a calculator.,826
9050,Bender,"I mean a good calculator. Minus the food, the bunny rabbit wallpaper--  I'm getting 100 bucks a kid and they're costing me 110!",826
9051,Fry,There goes my new kitchen cabinets.,826
9052,Bender,I'm not sitting through one more PTA meeting. The kids have got to go!,826
9053,Sam,"Daddy, how do I flush you?",826
9054,Bender,Just go to bed!,826
9055,Adlai,"You know, doing this jigsaw puzzle of a pacifier factory makes me want to have children with you all the more.",827
9056,Leela,"Adlai, I was thinking, since we're both orphans, maybe we should adopt a child.",827
9057,Adlai,"Adoption? Yes, that's acceptable. Heck, it's more than acceptable, it's adequately satisfactory!",827
9058,Bender,Hello? Imperial Dragon Restaurant? I've got a herd of you-know-whats for sale. Let me check.  What?,828
9059,Leela,"Hi, Bender. We'd like to adopt a child.",828
9060,Bender,"Well, you've come to the right place because Honest Bender's Orphanarium means discount orphans. Now, little lady. What do I have to do to send you home with 12 orphans today?",828
9061,Adlai,"Uh, I'm afraid we only want one.",828
9062,Bender,"Whatever you say, chief. I'll show you what I got in stock.",828
9063,Leela,I remember this from when we were kids,828
9064,Albert,I'm Albert.,828
9065,Leela,Kind of fatty.,828
9066,Bender,Then how about this little number? Pure-bred human. No vampire in there.,828
9067,Leela,"Uh, um.",828
9068,Adlai,Hmm.,828
9069,Bender,"If you're strapped for cash, you might wanna consider this irregular unit.  Cursed with a third ear but so full of that emotion I understand is called ""love"".",828
9070,Sally,"One time, I did a hundred jump ropes.",828
9071,Leela,"Oh, I can't decide. We're gonna have to think about it.",828
9072,Bender,"OK, kids, grown-ups gotta talk now, time for bed.",828
9073,Albert,But it's 10 in the morning!,828
9074,Bender,I said hit the hay!,828
9075,Leela,"Oh, they're all so adorable.",828
9076,Bender,"Yeah. You know, it's times like this I can hardly bear to let them go. Goodnight, you princes of Maine, you kings of New New England.",828
9077,Smitty,"You're under arrest for child cruelty, child endangerment, depriving children of food, selling children as food and misrepresenting the weight of livestock.",828
9078,Bender,"If you had kids of your own, you'd understand!",828
9079,Leela,"Officer, would it be alright if we adopted one of the kids?",829
9080,Smitty,Might as well. They're just gonna rot in the evidence locker.,829
9081,Orphan #1,Nice ear!,829
9082,Orphan #2,"Hey, freaky ears!",829
9083,Orphan #3,How's you hearing?,829
9084,Leela,I've made up my mind. Let's adopt her.,829
9085,Adlai,Her? But there's plenty of normal ones.,829
9086,Leela,"Come on, Adlai. She could really use a mom and dad.",829
9087,Kids,Ear-face! Ear-face! Sally won the ugly race!,829
9088,Adlai,"On the other hand, the children bring up a good point. She does have an ear on her face.",829
9089,Leela,Well? So what? She may be different but she still deserves a good home.,829
9090,Adlai,"Oh, alright. If you really want that one, I can give her an operation to make her acceptable.",829
9091,Leela,She doesn't need an operation! She's fine the way she is!,829
9092,Adlai,"Oh, and I suppose you were fine the way you were?",829
9093,Leela,Damn right I was!,829
9094,Fry,Yay!,829
9095,Leela,"Shut up, Fry. Now look, Adlai. I'm proud to be different. And I just wished I'd realised that when I was her age.",829
9096,Sally,I also have a tail!,829
9097,Leela,Now take me to the hospital and put my eye back the way it was. Right now!,829
9098,Adlai,Why should I do that?,829
9099,Leela,"Listen, buddy. By the end of the day, one of us is gonna have one eye.",829
9100,Vogel,"In recognition of Bender's generous gift of 12 orphans and a government cheque for 1200 wing-wangs, I hereby rename this building the Bender B. Rodriguez Orphanarium!",830
9101,Fry,It's good to have the old weird-looking Leela back.,830
9102,Leela,"Aww! You're a true friend, Fry. I guess there's nothing wrong with being a little weird.",830
9103,Fry,"Leela, there's nothing wrong with anything.",830
9104,Albert,"We'll miss you, Daddy Bender.",830
9105,Nina,We know robots don't have emotions but we drawed you this picture.,830
9106,Sally,"So if you ever miss us, even just a teeny bit, you can look at it.",830
9107,Bender,"Hey, I smoke a cigar, not a candy cane. Sheesh!  I hate you! I hate you all!",830

9115,Mrs. Wong,"OK, then. Make yourselves at home.",833

9118,Mr. Wong,17.9 billion acres. We own entire western hemisphere.  That the best hemisphere!,834

9121,Zoidberg,I broke your television.,834
9122,Hermes,"Mon, it must take forever to brand all those cattle.",834
9123,Mr. Wong,Not really. We own so much stuff it easier just to brand everything that not ours.,834

9125,Amy,"Betsy!  This is my sweet, little Betsy. I raised her from a larva that ate one of my sweaters.",834

9127,Amy,Dad! Gleesh! Please don't say things like that when you meet my boyfriend tonight.,834
9128,Mr. Wong,"Oh, that right. We finally get to spend some time with this Mr. Kif.",834
9129,Mrs. Wong,I just hope he's a nice man who can make us lot of grandchildren. This not some parallel universe where you getting any younger.,834
9130,Zapp,"Now remember, Kif, the quickest way to a girl's bed is through her parents. Have sex with them and you're in.",835
9131,Kif,"Actually, sir, I'm-I'm a little nervous about meeting her family.",835
9132,Zapp,"Well that's natural. After all you're meek and uninteresting. Until now you've gotten by on my left-over charisma, scrounging off it like a tiny charisma parasite.",835
9133,Kif,I just hope they like me.,835
9134,Zapp,"And why wouldn't they? Yes, yes, I know. Tiny, meek, uninteresting. Spare me your tedious life story, Kif. And above all have fun!",835

9140,Mr. Wong,They sell whole planet for one bead. Sound stupid to me!,836
9141,Farnsworth,That is stupid!,836
9142,Leela,"I can't believe you're laughing at the tragic exploitation of a proud, bead-loving people.",836
9143,Fry,"Lighten up, Leela. It's funny!",836
9144,Leela,Of course it is. But you don't have to laugh!,836

9164,Amy,"He's not scrawny, he's just small-boned.",836

9191,Hermes,Alright then.,838
9192,Mr. Wong,"Aye-ah! Those buggalo are what made Wong family so rich and powerful. Oh, Inez, with them stolen, we ruined!",838
9193,Mrs. Wong,OK. I want a divorce.,838
9194,Zoidberg,Mom! Dad! Don't ask me to choose!,838

9206,RJ,Here are your mounts!,839
9207,Leela,She's got a fine coat.,839
9208,Kif,"Now, we need buggalo to lure the rustlers. How many are left?",839
9209,Amy,"You're lookin' at her. Betsy's the only one left. She was curled up in my hamper when the storm hit.  Aw, she likes you!",839

9248,Amy,Are you sure there's no other way to get the buggalo out?,841
9249,Leela,Not unless your parents have thousands of helicopters at their disposal.,841
9250,Amy,"Well, actually--",841
9251,Bender,Too late! This is more fun!,841
9252,Amy,Kif! You did it! But how did you know the dynamite would work?,841
9253,Kif,I once took a seminar in ejecting chickens from a sand dune. The principle is essentially the same.,841
9254,Fry,"Hey, it's that ""barbecue's over"" sound again.",841
9255,Leela,We're in the eye of the storm!,841
9256,Fry,Where?,841
9257,Bender,What's that?,841
9258,Fry,My God!,841
9259,Leela,Who are they?,841
9260,Singing Wind,Fehk! We are the Native Martians.,841
9261,Fry,"Also, I didn't know buggalo could fly.",841
9262,Singing Wind,Only those who revere Mother Mars can fly buggalo. And only they shall have buggalo. And they're us.,841
9263,Kif,"But your, um, Martian-ness, these buggalo aren't yours. They belong to the Wong family.",841
9264,Singing Wind,You mean family that took all Martian land and gave us one lousy bead?,841
9265,Amy,Uh-huh! Amy Wong.  And you are?,841
9266,Singing Wind,Mad at Wong family! We plan to ruin them by stealing buggalo. But now we take girl instead.,841
9267,Amy,Wait! I'm too rich to be kidnapped!,841
9268,Kif,Amy! Nooo!,841
9269,Bender,"Don't worry, Kif. I'm sure some other beautiful, rich girl will fall in love with you.",841
9270,Mr. Wong,Hooray! You bring back cattle.,842
9271,Kif,Yes ... but ... I'm afraid I've got some bad news as well.,842
9272,Mrs. Wong,Let Amy tell us. That way it soften the blow.  Why Amy being so quiet?,842
9273,Kif,"Um ... well, um ... that is, um...",842
9274,Mr. Wong,"Oh, no! Martians kidnap Amy!  I know it them 'cause they no use good grammar.",842
9275,Kif,"I'll get your daughter back, sir. I swear.",842
9276,Mr. Wong,"Forget it, squishy. You the one lose her in first place. You done enough.",842
9277,Mrs. Wong,Yeah. This time we get most decorated law man in the whole universe!,842
9278,Kif,"You mean-- Oh, no, please. I beg you! Oh, for the love of--",842
9279,Zapp,"I am the man with no name. Zapp Brannigan, at your service!",843
9280,Mrs. Wong,"Please, Mr. Brannigan, we need you go get our daughter back.",843
9281,Zapp,Very well. I'll clean up Kif's mess. I shall go bargain with the Martian's personally.  Your gasps intrigue me. Explain.,843
9282,Mr. Wong,Martians have no land. They been gently encouraged to live on reservation deep underground. No one ever dare go there.,843
9283,Farnsworth,"This mission is incredibly dangerous. Someone's sure to be killed. Fry, Leela, Bender--",843
9284,Bender,"Damn you, old man!",843
9285,Leela,"Aw, look. Betsy followed you, Kif!",844
9286,Zapp,"I didn't realise you were bringing your girlfriend, lieutenant!",844
9287,Kif,She won't leave me alone.,844
9288,Zapp,"Did I say ""girlfriend""? She sounds more like a wife!",844
9289,Zapp,Behold,844
9290,Fry,Hm.,844
9291,Zapp,The only known entrance to the Martian reservation.,844
9292,Leela,What about the Great Stone Ass of Mars?,844
9293,Zapp,"Well, yeah, but it's way over the other side of the planet.",844
9294,Zapp,"Nose-ward, ho!",844
9295,Singing Wind,"Fehk! I am Singing Wind, chief of the Martian tribe.",844
9296,Zapp,Take me to your leader.,844
9297,Singing Wind,Moving along. Why you trespass on our land?,844
9298,Zapp,We come to negotiate the release of Amy Wong. And just to clarify,844
9299,Leela,They have such respect for the planet.,844
9300,Martian #1,Cynthia used to drink Slurm.,844
9301,Singing Wind,We will give back girl when we get back planet surface.,844
9302,Zapp,How do we even know she's alive?,844
9303,Amy,I'm fine.,844
9304,Zapp,Sh! You're weakening our bargaining position. How about instead you give us the girl and we carve a bunch of our presidents into your sacred mountain?,844
9305,Singing Wind,You waste words. We want return of land that was taken from us.,844
9306,Bender,"Uh, actually you traded it for a bead.",844
9307,Singing Wind,Tribe suffer heap big buyer's remorse. We want land back!,844
9308,Zapp,"Chief, my people are a people of law. And that law is ...  ... no backsies!",844
9309,Singing Wind,The time for stupid statements is over!,844
9310,Zapp,"Oh, boy!",844
9311,Leela,"Ow, ow, ow, ow! My eye!",844
9312,Zoidberg,Ma! Pa! Our precious ranch!,846
9313,Kif,"Amy, no! It's too windy!  Stay calm, dearest! I'll save you!",847
9314,Amy,Kif!  You're flying Betsy!,847
9315,Kif,Need a lift?,847
9316,Singing Wind,Great Mother Mars! He has the gift!,847
9317,Leela,"Yay, Kif!",847
9318,Zapp,"Kroker, that was one Brannigan-esque feat of heroism!",847
9319,Singing Wind,"We have misjudged you, green one. You fly the buggalo like us. You have true reverence for Mother Mars. Let there be peace between us.",847
9320,Martian #2,Yes. Let us smoke-em peace pipe.,847
9321,Kif,Smoke-em?,847
9322,Singing Wind,"Here, take.",848
9323,Kif,"Ooh, no thanks. I'm on the peace patch.",848
9324,Singing Wind,"You must smoke peace pipe, and you must do it peacefully. Or we'll kill you.",848
9325,Kif,"Well, it's just really that I don't feel that--",848
9326,Zapp,"Don't be such a chicken, Kif. Teenagers all smoke and they seem pretty on-the-ball.",848
9327,Fry,Yeah!,848
9328,Zapp,"Yes, sir!",848
9329,Bender,Way to suck it!,848
9330,Kif,"Hey, I'm smoking! I'm the greatest!  Oh, monkey trumpets!",848
9331,Singing Wind,You have coughed at our offer of peace. So you must die!,849
9332,Martian #3,The very bead used to crush our dreams shall be used to crush your bones.,849
9333,Kif,"Well, actually, I don't have bones. I'm supported by a system of fluid-filled bladders that--",849
9334,Fry,Wait. That's the bead you traded your land for?,849
9335,Leela,It's a gigantic diamond! That thing must be worth a fortune.,849
9336,Singing Wind,Really?,849
9337,Bender,"Oh, Chief, you've made me the happiest girl in the world!",849
9338,Amy,"Y'know, if you still want your land, we could just trade back for it.",849
9339,Singing Wind,Hmm. We always thought bead was worthless. We assumed our ancestors were cheated because they not have concept of ownership.,849
9340,Bender,So we can have the diamond?,849
9341,Singing Wind,No. We do have concept of ownership. You are free to go. Sorry about all the rustling and kidnapping.,849
9342,Leela,But what about your sacred land?,849
9343,Singing Wind,"Land shmand! We don't wanna live on this planet. It's a dump. We'll buy new planet and act like it's sacred. With cash like this, who's going to argue? Nobody, that's who!",849
9344,Amy,"Then Kif flew Betsy, rescued me from the tornado and made peace with the Martians.",851
9345,Mr. Wong,Please! He too much of a wimp.,851
9346,Mrs. Wong,Yeah. I'm sure it was all Mr. Zapp Brannigan here.,851
9347,Zapp,"Please, you give me too little credit.",851
9348,Zoidberg,"Captain Brannigan, you're always welcome here at Rancho Zoidberg!",851
9349,Zoidberg,"Money doesn't make good people, no, siree!",851
9350,Amy,"Thanks for saving my life, Kif. You're my hero.",851
9351,Kif,"Oh, you're kind. But your parents still don't like me.",851
9352,Amy,Well globviously! But if they liked you then I wouldn't. Don't you know anything about girls?,851
9353,Kif,"Dear diary, I just made love for the second time!",851
9354,Announcer,... Thompson's Teeth,851
9355,Farnsworth,"Good news, everyone! Today marks our dear friend Dr. Zoidberg's 10th year with Planet Express. Huzzahs are in order.",852
9356,Fry,Huzzah!,852
9357,Leela,Huzzah!,852
9358,Amy,Huzzah!,852
9359,Zoidberg,Hooray for me! Hooray for Zoidberg!,852
9360,Hermes,"I will now read the mandatory speech.  Dear employee. Has it really been five, 10 or 15 years? If not, please disregard this and get back to work. Distribute token of appreciation and applaud.",852
9361,Zoidberg,"Look! Coupons! I can get two oil changes for the price of one! Now if I could only afford the one ... and the car. Ah, the years! So many memories, so many strange fluids gushing out of patients' bodies--",852
9362,Hermes,"Yes, yes. Now here's your pension statement.  It's empty because you haven't paid into it, you dumb stinkbug!",852
9363,Zoidberg,You kept track of it all these years!,852
9364,Fry,"Oh, no, I'm boned! I haven't paid into the pension either. What'll I do when I retire?",852
9365,Bender,I thought you were retired.,852
9366,Fry,"Hey, I don't see you planning for your old age.",852
9367,Bender,"I got plans. I'm gonna turn my on/off switch to ""off"".",852
9368,Fry,Well I'm gonna take action. It's time to check on my retirement fund.  Damn! Still only $100.,852
9369,Franklin,"A penny saved is a penny earned. Also, could you get some athlete's foot cream for my face?",852
9370,Fry,He's right! I've gotta start investing wisely.,852
9371,Fry,"Well, I'm down to my last lottery ticket.  Mule. Crud!",853
9372,Bender,"So, you got six bucks left to retire on. I recommend Tender Vittles.",853
9373,Teller,You're opening a retirement account for $6? I'm sure a wealthy ...  ... mule farmer like yourself is aware that we charge a $10 monthly fee.,854
9374,Fry,You gotta spend money to make money.,854
9375,Teller,"Here you are, sir. Your account is now overdrawn by $4.",854
9376,Robot,"Gee, I've seen lines move faster in a sperm bank.",854
9377,Bender,That's for sure--  Roberto! Is that you?,854
9378,Roberto,"Bender! Hey, man!",854
9379,Bender,You old lunatic! How you been?,854
9380,Roberto,"Not bad, not bad.  Everybody on the floor! This is a stick-up!",854
9381,Bender,"Yeah, I'm doing OK too.  I'm taking a Chinese cooking class at the Learning Annex.",854
9382,Roberto,Cool. Ca-Can you give me a hand here?,854
9383,Bender,"Sure thing, pal.",854
9384,Roberto,"Hey, you! Red!  Quit watering that plant and get the door!",854
9385,Bender,"Well, nice talking to you.",854
9386,Roberto,Same here.  You guys are alright! Here's something for your trouble.,854
9387,Bender,"Hey, thanks, buddy!",854
9388,Smitty,"Freeze, punks! You're under arrest!",854
9389,Nixon,Shoot them in the back! Quick! While they're not looking!,854
9390,Bailiff,Court is in session. The Honourable Judge Whitey presiding.,855
9391,Whitey,"The charge is bank robbery. Now, my caddie chauffeur informs me that a bank is a place where people put money that isn't properly invested. Therefore, robbing a bank is tantamount to that most heinous of crimes, theft of money.",855
9392,Hyper-Chicken,"As the surveillance camera for the bank what all the judge was a-jawing about, could y'all tell us what you done seen the day of the crime?",855
9393,Camera,"Well, let's see. My memory's a little fuzzy, but it went exactly like this",855
9394,Hyper-Chicken,"Your Honour, I move that I be disbarred for introducing this evidence against my own clients.",855
9395,Hyper-Chicken,"Mr. Fry, do you recognise the robot a-huggin' on you in this here hologram?",855
9396,Fry,I sure do! That's the real robber and I'll never forget his name as long as I live. And that name is--,855
9397,Leela,Fry! Just give a name. You don't wanna look stupid on Court TV!,855
9398,Fry,You're right. You're right. It was--,855
9399,Whitey,Yes? What? You say if I testify I'll be killed? Oh. It's for you.,855
9400,Roberto,...and the other hamburger will...,855
9401,Roberto,"...also be made of your lungs. So long, pal.",855
9402,Fry,I refuse to testify on the grounds that my organs will be chopped up into a patty.,855
9403,Whitey,"Ah, the 67th Amendment.",855
9404,Hyper-Chicken,I may be a simple country Hyper-Chicken but I know when we're finger-licked. Whattya say we plead insanity?,855
9405,Bender,A few months in an insane asylum? I could do that standing on my head.,855
9406,Hyper-Chicken,"If you start now, it might help our case.",855
9407,Whitey,"Counselor, what evidence do you offer to support this new plea of insanity?",855
9408,Hyper-Chicken,"Well, for one, they done hired me to represent them.",855
9409,Whitey,"Insanity plea is accepted. Mr. Bender, I hereby commit you to the asylum for criminally insane robots until such time as you are deemed cured.",855
9410,Bender,Yahoo! The system fails again!,855
9411,Whitey,"And, Mr. Fry, I sentence you to the home for criminally insane humans.",855
9412,Bailiff,"Your Honour, that facility has been full ever since you ruled that being poor is a mental illness.",855
9413,Whitey,Order! Order! The only poor people I want to hear about are the people who tend to my pores at the spa. Just send them both to the robot loony bin and let's go.,855
9414,Fry,Ow! My head! Ow! My feet! Ow! My head! Ow! My feet!,855
9415,Farnsworth,Keep your chin up!,855
9416,Fry,Ow! My chin!,855
9417,Fry,"I don't belong here, Bender. This is an asylum for insane robots!",856
9418,Bender,"Well, you meet half the qualifications.",856
9419,Fry,"Oh, good, a physical! Once they examine my fragile, naked, pink body, they'll see I'm not a--",856
9420,Fry,What the--,856
9421,Bender,I find that offensive!,856
9422,Dr. Perceptron,Greetings. I am Dr. Perceptron. Let me give you something to help you relax.,857
9423,Fry,"Look! There's been a terrible mistake. I'm a human being. See?  I'm all squishy and flabby. Also, I complain a lot.",857
9424,Dr. Perceptron,"Yes, you do. You need to relax more.  Terrific. Now, consider the following",857
9425,Fry,I do other human stuff! I age! See?,857
9426,Nurse Ratchet,"I'm Nurse Ratchet. Please come with me, won't you?",857
9427,Nurse Ratchet,"We'll meet your roommate next, shall we? His name is Malfunctioning Eddie.",858
9428,Fry,The car dealer? Wow! I guess his prices really were insane.,858
9429,Nurse Ratchet,He's very excitable.  So don't say anything to surprise him.,858
9430,Malfunctioning Eddie,Pleased to meet you.,858
9431,Fry,"Actually, we've met once before.",858
9432,Malfunctioning Eddie,What?,858
9433,Hairbot,I'm a pretty girl. I'm a pretty girl. I'm a pretty girl.,859
9434,Bender,Whoa! Someone had a busy day.,859
9435,Fry,"My roommate exploded. Oh, you gotta help me, Bender. How can I prove I'm human?",859
9436,Bender,You could drop dead. That'd show 'em.,859
9437,Fry,I don't wanna!,859
9438,Unit 2013,"Hey, man. I believe you're a human.",859
9439,Fry,You do?,859
9440,Unit 2013,"Sure. They don't believe I'm a human either. Name's Unit 2013. C'mon. Lemme introduce you around.  Fry, meet Norm. How's it going, pal? Still picking up transmissions from the CIA on your teeth?",859
9441,Norm,They just won't stop!,859
9442,Woman,The CIA cafeteria menu for the week of May 15th is as follows,859
9443,Unit 2013,Cuckoo!,859
9444,Fry,"Let me guess, he thinks he's Lincoln?",859
9445,Unit 2013,"Well, he's supposed to. Problem is he's got multiple personalities -- all of them Lincoln.",859
9446,Lincolnbot,I was born in 200 log cabins.,859
9447,Unit 2013,"And this here is Frankie. He's convinced he's a lunchroom worker, so they put him to work in the lunchroom.  How is work in the lunchroom, Frankie?",860
9448,Frankie,It's alright.,860
9449,Unit 2013,Poor Frankie!,860
9450,Mad Hatterbot,Change places!,860
9451,Fry,"Bender, I can't take much more of this! I want outta here!",860
9452,Bender,"Are you crazy? This place is great! Electroshock whenever you want it, two Lincolns for every Napoleon.  Ah! Sweet light crude!",860
9453,Fry,But I'm not a robot like you. I don't like having discs crammed into me. Unless they're Oreos -- and then only in the mouth! Don't you understand? I'm gonna die here!,860
9454,Bender,"Ah, quit your bellyaching and take it like a robot.",860
9455,Mad Hatterbot,Change places!,860
9456,Victor,The doctor says you are making great strides with your exploding problem.,861
9457,Malfunctioning Eddie,"Well, the way I see it--",861
9458,Fry,You gotta get me out of here. I would have starved to death if not for that sick vending machine robot.  Gimme! Gimme!,861
9459,Hermes,Poor Fry! He's got the munchies for freedom!,861
9460,Leela,We're all trying to help you. We've petitioned the governor but he doesn't want to appear soft on people who've been falsely imprisoned.,861
9461,Fry,At least I have friends on the outside. Bender's been no help at all.,861
9462,Bender,"Je suis Napoleon!  No, seriously, I'm not.",861
9463,Amy,Bender! You should be more ashamed of yourself than usual.,861
9464,Bender,"Ah, lighten up, honey. I'm just trying to get through a difficult time using humour.",861
9465,Nurse Ratchet,Visiting hours are over. Time for our medication disks.,861
9466,Fry,"Help me! For God's sake, help me!",861
9467,Farnsworth,"Oh, don't worry, Fry. I too once spent a nightmare-ish time in a robot asylum. But now it's nearly over. So long.",861
9468,Fry,"Oh, God! What? What? What is it now?",862
9469,Dr. Perceptron,You are being released.,862
9470,Fry,"Finally! Sweet justice! Sweet, juicy justice!",862
9471,Dr. Perceptron,Not you. Him.,862
9472,Malfunctioning Eddie,Me? What a surprise.  Look!,862
9473,Malfunctioning Eddie,I barely exploded at all.,862
9474,Dr. Perceptron,We can control that with medication.,862
9475,Nurse Ratchet,Fry? Are we ready to meet our new roommate?,862
9476,Roberto,"Hi, Red!",862
9477,Fry,Roberto! W-W-W-What are you doing here?,862
9478,Roberto,I got busted robbing that bank again.,862
9479,Fry,Why would you hold up the same bank twice?,862
9480,Roberto,"Ah, that first time was just to case the joint and rob it a little.  What's the matter? You scared?",862
9481,Fry,N-- N-- N--,862
9482,Roberto,"Noticeably? I'll say! Now stand back, I gotta practise my stabbing.",862
9483,Fry,No! Please! Help! Stop it! Please!,862
9484,Bender,Hey! Keep it down in there! I'm tuning my banjo!,862
9485,Roberto,"Jeez, Red. Quit cowering. You call yourself a robot?",862
9486,Fry,I'm not a robot!  I'm not a robot!,862
9487,Dr. Perceptron,"In answer to your question, Hermes, yes, your friend is cured.",863
9488,Hermes,Oh!,863
9489,Farnsworth,What a relief!,863
9490,Leela,Thank God!,863
9491,Dr. Perceptron,You'll notice he no longer suffers delusions of humanity.,863
9492,Fry,"Affirmative. I feel nothing. I am a robot. Beep, beep, beep ...",863
9493,Leela,"You've made a terrible mistake. He's a human being, not a machine. Oh, Fry!",863
9494,Bender,"Bonjour, y'all!",863
9495,Zoidberg,"Listen to me, Fry. Just because you think you're a robot, doesn't make you a robot. After all, I think I'm a doctor but that doesn't make me a doctor. These fancy clothes do!",864
9496,Fry,Negative. I must be a robot. Why else would human women refuse to date me?,864
9497,Leela,"Oh, lots of reasons.",864
9498,Fry,"Bio-units, terminate noise exchange. It is time for you to ingest sandwiches from my compartment.",864
9499,Bender,Here we go. Just a minute. Aha!,865
9500,Commentator,"And down the stretch, it's Daddy's Little Grandpa, followed by Perennial Loser, and bringing up the rear, it's Lasty!",865
9501,Bender,"Come on, Lasty!",865
9502,Roberto,"Hey, Bender.",865
9503,Bender,"Roberto! Ooh, what a surprise to see you in here! Especially 'cause I didn't squeal on you, remember? Remember all that squealing I didn't do? Remember? Do you?",865
9504,Roberto,"Yeah, yeah. Now lie down and play dead. And don't ham it up!",865
9505,Bender,"Uh, sure.  Anything for you, buddy.",865
9506,Roberto,"Wait here, Bender. I need to get a disguise.",865
9507,Bender,"Uh, what's with the get-up?",865
9508,Roberto,I'm in disguise 'cause I'm thinking of escaping. You in? Or do I gotta kill you so you don't squeal?,865
9509,Bender,I'm in! I'm in!  So when were you planning the breakout?,865
9510,Roberto,I'm thinking maybe a few seconds ago.,865
9511,Bender,Quick! Let's keep escaping!,865
9512,Hermes,"Times two, carry the one...",866
9513,Fry,"Oh, you sad, worthless human.",866
9514,Hermes,What are ya-- Sacred hog of Prague! That was my anniversary gift to LaBarbara!,866
9515,Fry,Fear not! For I shall assist ye!,866
9516,Hermes,"Robots don't say ""ye""!",866
9517,Fry,"Relax, mammal. My robotic software shall meet your calculatory needs.  What is the meaning of this symbol?",866
9518,Hermes,"That's a plus sign, you pointy-haired loony! Quit thinking you're a robot!",866
9519,Fry,I'll show ye!,866
9520,Fry,Stand back. I'm a tool-bot.,867
9521,Leela,You're not a tool-bot. You're not a food-motron. You're not a robot of any kind.,867
9522,Fry,"Yes, I am. I simply haven't discovered my primary function yet.",867
9523,Leela,"OK, this has gotta stop. I'm going to remind Fry of his humanity the way only a woman can.",867
9524,Farnsworth,You're going to do his laundry?,867
9525,Leela,"Fry, this is for you.",867

9600,LaBarbara,"Now hold on. Everyone, cool your daiquiris! Let's give the little vermin a chance to explain themselves.",873
9601,Dwight,"It was self defence, Mom. Just look at this letter the principal sent.  We were in science class and we had just finished building a miniature black hole.",873

9605,Bret,Neither do nerds!,873

9608,Bret,"When I re-solidify, I'm gonna put you in a world of goop!",873
9609,Cubert,See? That bully started it. We couldn't fight back with brawn so we used our brains!,873
9610,Farnsworth,I've warned you not to use those things!,873
9611,Leela,"Let's see. We've got our malt, our hops. We just need a big disposable tub to mix it in.",874
9612,Bender,Yo!,874
9613,Leela,Now it needs to boil for a couple hours.,874
9614,Hermes,"Dwight, you remember the crew.",874
9615,Dwight,Eh.,874
9616,Farnsworth,"Crew, you remember Cubert?  Wonderful! Then I'm sure you won't mind being their legal guardians for a month!",874
9617,Cubert,"Well, well.  ... idiot!",874
9618,Bender,We're making beer. I'm the brewery.,874
9619,Dwight,I heard alcohol makes you stupid.,874
9620,Fry,No I'm ... doesn't.,874
9621,Leela,"Actually, Dwight, you're right. Alcohol is very, very bad ... for children. But once you turn 21 it becomes very, very good. So scram!",874
9622,Dwight,"Aw, man!",874
9623,Cubert,I'm sick of this.,874
9624,Cubert,"Hey, Dad. What useless contraption are you half-baking today?",875
9625,Farnsworth,"Eh, wha? Oh! This is my latest invention; a device that lets anyone sound exactly like me!",875
9626,Cubert,"Good news, everyone! I'm a horse's butt!",875
9627,Farnsworth,"I am? That's not good news at all, you little--",875
9628,Dwight,What's this devices marketability? Who's the target consumer?,875
9629,Farnsworth,"There is no target consumer! Only targets. Targets that will tremble in fear as their new master hands down edicts in my glorious, booming voice!  Now quit pestering me, you scoundrels!",875
9630,Hermes,"Stamp it, file it. Oh, yeah! Send it overnight!",876
9631,Dwight,Can I collate that?,876
9632,Hermes,No!,876
9633,Cubert,Can I shred these contracts?,876
9634,Hermes,No!,876
9635,Dwight,Wow! A power-stamper!,876
9636,Hermes,Now look at all the work I gotta do!  Ow!,876
9637,Leela,Mmm. The ingredients are cooked. And they've picked up some of your natural robot flavourings. Time to add the yeast.,877
9638,Bender,Yeast? You mean I'll have a lifeform growing inside me?  It's so beautiful.,877
9639,Leela,Talk to me.,877
9640,Farnsworth,"This is Professor Farnsworth. I have an important delivery for you and your dumb crew. You must deliver a pizza to Dogdoo 8, a planet at the edge of the universe.",877
9641,Cubert,"Sorry I can't come down to say goodbye, but I'm busy inventing useless junk.",877
9642,Dwight,And I smell bad.,877

9646,Bender,Those pork dumplings sent us on a fake pizza delivery.,878
9647,Fry,The address was on Dogdoo 8 but the universe ends right after Dogdoo 7.,878
9648,Hermes,"Child man, is this true?",878
9649,Dwight,"Yeah, but why are you mad at us? Your dummy brigade wasted a week on an obviously fake mission.",878
9650,Cubert,"Plus, they're making bootleg beer inside company property!",878
9651,Bender,Lies! Lies and slander!,878
9652,Farnsworth,Accusing gentle Bender of a misdeed? That's the last straw! You boys have been underfoot long enough!,878
9653,Hermes,You jerked the words right outta my mouth. We're their fathers and it's high times we acted like it.,878
9654,Bender,Ooh-hoo! Here comes violence!,878
9655,Hermes,"Get a job, you lazy kids!",878
9656,Bender,I guess if you want children beaten ...  ... you have to do it yourself.,878

9658,Dwight,"You don't wanna miss the unveiling of our new company, do you?",879
9659,Hermes,Company?  How cute! What will you be pedalling? Lemonade? Shoe shines? Cootie insurance?,879
9660,Farnsworth,Perhaps they've constructed a teddy bear hospital!,879
9661,Cubert,"Actually, we're starting a competing delivery company.",879
9662,Hermes,Welcome to the world of business!,879
9663,Farnsworth,"Who's going to use a delivery service with a kicked sign? Nobody, that's who!",879
9664,Dwight,But we already have a client signed up. We're delivering the Daily Supernova.,879
9665,Hermes,"So your delivery company is just a cute, harmless paper route?",879
9666,Farnsworth,Phew!,879
9667,Dwight,No! It's a serious business.,879
9668,Farnsworth,"Yes it's a tremendous responsibility, alright!  What if a paper were to land in a puddle?",879
9669,Hermes,Civilisation as we know it might get splashed!,879
9670,Dwight,Why do they always treat us like dumb kids? We're practically old enough to find the Fox Network infantile!,880
9671,Cubert,We'll show 'em. All Awesome Express needs is a sturdy interstellar delivery craft.  Voilà! You got a quarter?,880
9672,Dwight,"Man, the ad said to allow four to six seconds for delivery.",880
9673,Cubert,More like seven!,880
9674,Bender,I'm really starting to swell up with beer. I must look ridiculous.,881
9675,Fry,"No, you have a healthy glow.",881
9676,Bender,"Oh, my God! I just felt it ferment!",881
9677,Leela,Ooh! Let me feel.  Have you thought about what to name it?,881
9678,Bender,"I was thinking ""Benderbrau"" if it's an ale, ""Botweiser"" if it's a lager.",881
9679,Fry,"I hope it's a lager so I can take it to a ball game.  Ooh, I felt that one!",881
9680,Cubert,"Uh, there's a crack in the hull here. That could cause explosive decompression.",882
9681,Dwight,Put a sticker on it.,882
9682,Hermes,"Off on your first delivery, eh? You be careful, my little tinkler.  Remember we used to call you that, huh? Tinkler?",882
9683,Sal,Gets movin'! Those newspapers won'ts deliver themselveses! Only the Sunday edition can dos that.,882
9684,Farnsworth,"Goodness, there must be 50 papers in that bundle! That's a big number, 50.",882
9685,Cubert,"Yeah, if you're an idiot!",882
9686,Dwight,"Three, two, one.",882
9687,Cubert,All systems go.,882

9717,Leela,"Uh, guys, I don't know how to tell you this, so I'll just let Fry blurt it out thoughtlessly.",885
9718,Fry,We don't work for you anymore!,885

9732,Hermes,Sweet guinea pig of Winnipeg! They've taken over our company!,886
9733,Farnsworth,Balderdash! I never agreed to that!,886
9734,Dwight,No. But you did declare yourself dead three years ago as a tax dodge.,886
9735,Farnsworth,"Tax dodge, nothing! You take one nap in a ditch at the park and they start declaring you this and that.",886
9736,Cubert,"Either way, I technically inherit your building and your spaceship, which means Planet Express is now ...  ... Awesome Express!",886

9818,Bender,What's that? One of those Led Zeppelins I've heard so much about?,896
9819,Fry,"No, it's an old Volkswagen van.  Hey, Mister? Mind if I take this old van?",896
9820,Sal,"Sure. You wanna dump the corpses out of theres, it's yourses.",896
9821,Fry,"Yeah, yeah, I've gotten used cars before.",896
9822,Leela,What's that? One of those Jefferson Starships I've heard so much about?,897
9823,Fry,"It's called a van, and in light of the fact that it's not a-rockin', I invite you to come a-knockin'!",897
9824,Amy,"Wow, neat.",897
9825,Hermes,It's a triumph of free-spirited German engineering.,897
9826,Amy,"Hey, the speedometer only goes up to 80. This thing can't go faster than 80,000 miles an hour?",897
9827,Fry,"No, it can't, but it's got a driver's-side floor and an 8-track player with genuine mono sound.",897
9828,Farnsworth,Where's the device that lets you speed or slow the passage of time?,897
9829,Fry,Under the seat.,897
9830,Leela,Why won't it start?,897
9831,Fry,It just needs some gas.,897
9832,Farnsworth,"Wrong again, idiot. There is no gas. Petroleum reserves ran dry in 2038.",897
9833,Leela,"Gas was an environmental disaster, anyway. Now we use alternative fuels.",897
9834,Fry,Like what?,897
9835,Leela,"Whale oil.  Bender, lift it up to the can opener.",897
9836,Bender,"Oh, no! I'm not going near it. Last time, that magnetic psycho nearly cut my head off.",897
9837,Fry,"Oh, right. Plus, the magnet screws up your inhibition unit and makes you sing folk songs.",897
9838,Bender,What? Who said anything about me secretly wanting to be a folk singer? How ridiculous.,897
9839,Fry,"Bender, if you don't open that can right now, your fear will own you, and nothing that can opener could ever do would be worse than that.",897
9840,Bender,"OK, OK, I can do this. It's time to take life by the cans.",897
9841,Leela,Come on!,897
9842,Hermes,You can do it!,897
9843,Amy,Bender!,897
9844,Farnsworth,"Go on, you dummy.",897
9845,Bender,"Jimmy cracked corn and I don't care,",897
9846,Fry,"Oh, no!",897
9847,Bender,"Jimmy cracked corn and I don't care,Cause the master's gone away.",897
9848,Zoidberg,It's toe-tapping-ly tragic.,897
9849,Bender,"Doc, I can't move my arms and legs. What's wrong with me?",898
9850,Doctor,This is the worst part of the job.,898
9851,Bender,"What is it, good news?",898
9852,Doctor,"Bender, your hydraulics are shot. You'll never move again.",898
9853,Bender,You mean--,898
9854,Doctor,"I'm sorry, you'll have to get a new one.",898
9855,Fry,"Oh, no! This is terrible.",898
9856,Zoidberg,Poor Bender.,898
9857,Farnsworth,"Well, let's drag him to the kerb.",898
9858,Fry,"Wait a minute, Bender is my best friend. We can't just dump him in the gutter like Grandma's ashes.",898
9859,Bender,"Oh, my life is over. I'll never know happiness again.",898
9860,Robot,"Ho, ho! Hello there!",898
9861,Leela,"Look, Bender! It's Patch Cord Adams. He heals with the power of laughter.",898
9862,Patch Cord Adams,"Come on, take it. What's the matter, can't move your arms?",898
9863,Bender,"Obviously not, or I'd be strangling you right now.",898
9864,Patch Cord Adams,"Hey, here's a giggle!  Did you hear why they're using Windows 3000 as a prison guard?",898
9865,Fry,"No, why?",898
9866,Patch Cord Adams,'Cause it always locks up.,898
9867,Bender,"For the love of God, somebody kick his ass!",898
9868,Patch Cord Adams,"Well, so long. Get well soon.  Oh, well, so long anyway.",898
9869,Bender,"Oh, I'm doomed. Everybody leave me alone. I don't wanna be seen this way.",898
9870,Fry,"Aw, you look so sad. You want me to send Patch Cord Adams back in?",898
9871,Bender,"Hey, the blues. The tragic sound of other people's suffering. That's kind of a pick-me-up.  Wow, that was great.",898
9872,Beck,"Hey, thanks. You a fan?",898
9873,Bender,"I dunno. Let me see.  Oh, my God, you're Beck! I'd get up to shake your hand and steal your wallet but my crappy body crapped out on me.",898
9874,Beck,Don't take it so hard. I used to miss my body too but then I fished this mannequin out of the 92c Store dumpster.,898
9875,Bender,"Wow. We've sure got a lot in common, Beck. I always dreamed of being a musician-poet who transcends genres even as he re-invents them, just like you.",898
9876,Beck,"So do it, robot. It's easier than it looks.",898
9877,Bender,"Eh, thanks, but it's hopeless. I'll never be a musician now.",898
9878,Beck,Or maybe you'll be the best musician ever.,898
9879,Bender,What's this for?,898
9880,Beck,"Try and scrape it across your chest like a knife on burnt toast.  Yeah-ee! Alright, congratulations, my friend.",898
9881,Bender,Why? 'Cause I can make annoying noises?,898
9882,Beck,"Exactly. I use those all the time in my music. Bender, I want you to become my new washboard player.",898
9883,Bender,Alright!  Go Bender! Go Bender! Go Bender!,898
9884,Bender,"Well, that's my good friend, Beck. I'm off to rock a series of mid-level venues.",899
9885,Hermes,"Kudos, Bender. You got mangled and now you're a singer. Both our dreams came true.",899
9886,Fry,"Hey, I have an idea. Who wants to cram in my van and follow Bender on tour and live there, in the van?",899
9887,Zoidberg,"Oh, I don't know, Fry. I think I'm too poor to follow a band around in a van.",899
9888,Beck,"Come on, move it! We gotta get to the concert and make the audience wait for it at the start.",899
9889,[Montage,"The tour bus passes under the Holland Tunnel with the VW right behind it, causing a tailback. They drive from New New York, through New New Jersey, Washington A.C., East West Virginia to a little town called Squatter's Corners in West Virginia .]",899
9890,Zoidberg,"Bad news, friends. My shell ran.",900
9891,Amy,"Zoidberg, you idiot, my outfit. It's, it's--",900
9892,Leela,Kinda cool.,900
9893,Fry,"Yeah, I like it.",900
9894,Amy,"Me too, now that I'm used to it.",900
9895,Zoidberg,"Then it was all on purpose! You're lucky to have Zoidberg as a friend. But cross me, and I'll turn on you like that!",900
9896,[Scene,Squatter's Corners Civic Audeetorium. Beck and the band play their gig to some hicks in a barn. They perform,901
9897,Beck,"There's a destination a little up the road,From the habitations and the towns we know,A place we saw the lights turn low,The jigsaw jazz and the get-fresh glow,Pullin' out jives and jamboree handouts,Two turntables and a microphone,Bottles and cans just clap your hands,Just clap your hands.",901
9898,All,Where it's at!,901
9899,Bender,Got a washboard stomach and a microphone.,901
9900,Beck,That was a washboard break.,901
9901,Fry,"Oh, yeah!",901
9902,Amy,"Yeah!  One bowl of Jell-O knuckles, please.",901
9903,Barman,That'll be three pick-e-tures of George Washington.,901
9904,Amy,"Oh, no! My beautiful money.",901
9905,Leela,It got ruined in the wash.,901
9906,Fry,"Mine too, even my change.",901
9907,Barman,"Get lost, you money-less hippies!",901
9908,Horrible Gelatinous Hick,"You heard him, freaks. We don't like your type around here. These are the types we like.",901
9909,Beck,"Bender, that was the best 40-minute washboard solo I've ever heard. And the parts when I was awake blew my mind.",901
9910,Bender,"Whoa, check out all those broken robots. Howdy, fellas!",901
9911,Robot #1,"I don't believe my broken eyes! It's Bender, the washboard player! Hey, man, we caught your concert from here.",901
9912,Robot #2,You rock!,901
9913,Fembot,"Oh, oh, Bender! Sign my chest! It's in that bin behind me.",901
9914,Robot #3,"Yo, brother, thanks for showing that broken robots are still useful.",901
9915,Bender,"Aw, hang in there, folks. I'll bet before you know it, you guys'll be--  That is so wrong. They can't just melt down broken robots. Not right when they're kissing my ass.",901
9916,Beck,"Whoa, dog. Just cold chill.  You know, when I'm upset, I write a song about it. Like when I wrote Devil's Haircut, I was feeling really-- What's that song about?",901
9917,Bender,"Hey, yeah, I could write a song! With real words, not phoney ones like ""odelay"".",901
9918,Beck,"""Odelay"" is a word. Just look it up in the Becktionary.",901
9919,Bender,Ooh!,901
9920,Bender,"I'm working on my song. Hand me the Becktionary.  No, no, the rhyming Becktionary.",902
9921,Beck,I wish I could help raise awareness about broken robots. But what can I do? I only weigh eight pounds.,902
9922,Bender,"Wait a minute, you know lots of rock stars, and most of them like to look like they care about things!",902
9923,Beck,We can all get together for a big benefit concert in San Francisco!,902
9924,Bender,"And we could call it ""Bend-Aid"", after me, Bender!",902
9925,Beck,And you can sing that song you're writing!,902
9926,Bender,And I'll let you sing backup! But remember who the star is. Me,902
9927,Bender,"Alright. ""Hands in the air"" rhymes with ""Just don't care"" and ... finished!  Eck! Smells like something died in the wall!",903
9928,Fry,Surprise!,903
9929,Leela,Mind if we crash here tonight? The colours in the van are keeping us awake.,903
9930,Bender,"Alright, but hands off the minibar.",903
9931,Fry,"Wow, I forgot about TV. Living free on the road, you realise how much better life is without it. Well, let's see what's on.",903
9932,Announcer #1,"Tuesday, Golden Gate Park, the monsters of vaguely-folkish alterna-rock will strum your brains out at Bend-Aid! Featuring Beck, Wailing Fungus and special guest, Bender!",903

9934,Fry,Yeah!,903
9935,Zoidberg,"Hooray, robot!",903
9936,Amy,"Bender, you're famous!",903
9937,Bender,Yeah.,903
9938,Leela,"This coming-together of superstars really means a lot to you, doesn't it, Bender?",903
9939,Bender,"That's why I'll be proud to go up on stage tomorrow and say, ""Look at me, world, I am a broken robot!"".",903
9940,Fry,"Bender, you can move! You're cured!",903
9941,Bender,"Oh, crap! It's a miracle!",903
9942,Bender,I can move again.  My music career is over.,903
9943,Fry,"Bender, I don't claim to understand ""the biz"" but wouldn't being able to move help your music career?",903
9944,Bender,"Wait, that's it! I'll fake it!",903
9945,Amy,You'd better not do that at the concert.,904
9946,Zoidberg,"I can't stop. When I eat too much dirt, I get stuff in my throat.",904
9947,Amy,"You are so disgusting, I--",904
9948,Leela,They're beautiful.,904
9949,Zoidberg,"Ew, you're touching them!",904

9971,Bender,"Whoa-oh, yeah!",905
9972,Beck,"...Midnight hags in the mausoleum,",905
9973,Beck,"Thank you. That song doesn't usually last three hours, but we got into a serious thing ... and then I forgot how it ended. Anyway, one last item of business before we go.",905
9974,Garfunkel,"Bender, to start your foundation for broken robots, here's a big, cardboard cheque for $14,000.",905
9975,Cylon,It's been an emotional day for me.,905
9976,Bender,I don't know what to say.,905
9977,Beck,"Then maybe you should sing it. Lay it down, boys.",905
9978,Bender,"Ladies, gentlemen, smoking heaps of machinery ...  People say my broken friend is useless,But I say his mind is free,There's lots of things my mangled robot friend could be,",905
9979,Beck,Kick it!,905
9980,Bender,He could make a good...,905
9981,Bender,and   ...hat-rack,905

9983,Bender,Or a cheap...,905
9984,Bender,"and   ...doorstop,",905
9985,Beck,He doesn't need to move,905

9988,Bender,"With a twist-off top,",905
9989,Beck,"That would be good for soup,",905
9990,Bender,He could be a storage closet...,905

9992,Beck,I like 'em tight!,905
9993,Bender,"My broken friend could do it all,",905

9996,Beck,For real?,905
9997,Bender,"...My broken friend is closer to me,Than an ass to a chair...",905
9998,Beck,Hm.,905
9999,Bender,...That robot's name I never told you...,905
10000,Beck,Who's that?,905
10001,Bender,...You could not foresee...,905
10002,Beck,"C'mon, give it up.",905
10003,Bender,...I'll say it loud and sing it proud...,905
10004,Bender,and   His name is you and me.,905
10005,Bender,"Don't melt me down into a crowbar,",905
10006,Beck,"It suffers alone,",905
10007,Bender,"Just 'cause I can't move my arms and legs,",905
10008,Beck,Hey.,905
10009,Bender,Or toss me into a trash can...,905
10010,Beck,"Bender, what are you doing?",905
10011,Bender,...Just 'cause I can't cook you ham and eggs...,905
10012,Beck,What are you doing?,905
10013,Bender,...Don't crush me into an anchor...,905
10014,Beck,Yo! What's the dealy-o?,905
10015,Bender,...Just 'cause I can't jump and dance and sing...,905
10016,Beck,Hold it! What? No!,905
10017,Bender,"...I'm telling you, my broken friend...",905
10018,Beck,B-Bender.,905
10019,Bender,...Put your hands in the air like you just don't care!,905

10022,Beck,Cut it!,905
10023,Bender,...Can do 'most anything!,905
10024,Beck,Cut it!,905
10025,Bender,Yeah!,905

10036,Bender,"Oh, no! I forgot this is a hoverbridge.",906
10037,Leela,And I forgot this isn't a hovercar.,906
10038,Fry,Is any of that a problem?,906
10039,Zoidberg,Not if you've lived a life without regret.,906
10040,Bender,I'll save me!,906
10041,Leela,"Quick, grab his footcups.",906
10042,Bender,Hey? What? No.,906
10043,Fry,Phew!,906
10044,Leela,Bummer.,906
10045,Bender,I'm broken again. I can't move any part of me.,907
10046,Beck,Good.,907
10047,Bender,"I'm really sorry I lied, Beck. All I ever wanted was to make music with you. I never meant to hurt anyone, or help anyone.",907
10048,Beck,"Bender, that's some played-out, new-jack, horse crap-- But I know you don't mean it so apology accepted.",907
10049,Bender,"So, I can, uh, keep the cheque?",907
10050,Garfunkel,Over my dead career!,907
10051,Bender,"Well, it was worth a shot.",907
10052,Fry,"C'mon, Bender. If you're done scamming Beck, we're heading home.",907
10053,Bender,"Alright, alright. Let me just do one thing to cheer myself up.Fry cracked corn,And I don't care,Leela cracked corn,I still don't care,Bender cracked corn,And he is great!Take that, you stupid corn!",907
10054,Hermes,"Go get it, boy!",908
10055,Fry,"So, Leela, how about a romantic ride in one of those swan boats? They're kinda dangerous but I finally mastered them.",908
10056,Leela,"Those aren't swan boats, they're swans.",908
10057,Fry,Oh. That explains these boat eggs.,908
10058,Farnsworth,Wha?,908
10059,Tate,"Pitiful ballplayers of Earth, I am Ethan ""Bubblegum"" Tate, commander of the Harlem Globetrotters.  Will no one meet our challenge? Have none of you pathetic Earthlings game?",908
10060,Fry,What happens if we lose?,908
10061,Tate,"Nothing. There's nothing at stake and no threat, beyond the shame of defeat!",908
10062,Farnsworth,"This will not stand!  I'll take you on, you air-balling bozos.",908
10063,Tate,"You, old man? Sweet Clyde, laugh derisively at him.",908
10064,Farnsworth,"I may be an old man. In fact, I'm fairly sure I am. But I'll put you Globetrotters in your place with my team of mutant atomic supermen!",908
10065,Hermes,"Hooray, Professor!",908
10066,Farnsworth,Behold,909
10067,Leela,"They're only a foot high, Professor.",909
10068,Farnsworth,"Well, they're still young. Mere atomic super boys, really. We'll need to speed up their growth with time particles called Chronitons.",909
10069,Bender,Aren't those the particles that destroyed an entire civilisa--,909
10070,Farnsworth,"Good news, everyone! You're off to the Tempus Nebula to gather Chronitons.",909
10071,Fry,"Hey, Leela, look at me!",910
10072,Leela,Your face can take a lot of punishment. That's good to know.,910
10073,Fry,There's a lot about my face you don't know! Perhaps you and it could get better acquainted over dinner.,910
10074,Leela,"Alright! Cool your jets, hotshot.",910
10075,Fry,"C'mon, Leela, why won't you go out with me? We both know there's something there.",910
10076,Leela,"No, I mean cool your jets. They're melting Bender's face.",910
10077,Bender,"Ow! Oh, my God! Ow!",910
10078,Leela,Here you go. Hot off the nebula.,911
10079,Farnsworth,None too soon. While you were gone the Trotters held a news conference to announce that I was a jive sucker.  Behold! My invincible nuclear mutants.,911
10080,Amy,Hi!,911
10081,Arachneon,Hello!,911
10082,Albert,Marv Albert here at Madison Cube Garden where the Harlem Globetrotters take on a squad of atomic supermen in what promises to be a by-the-numbers athletic contest with no surprises whatsoever.  Here's the tip-off. Globetrotter ball. Sweet Clyde Dixon to Bubblegum Tate. Drives down-court-- And Curly Joe from the rear.,912
10083,Zoidberg,That one grabbed his behindus!,912
10084,Leela,Sh!,912
10085,Hermes,Quiet!,912
10086,Tate,"Who dares laugh at the Jesters of Dunk? We came to terrify and humiliate you, not tickle your funnybones. Watch as I embarrass your civilisation by passing the ball to Curly Joe.  And perhaps this will wipe the smiles from your faces.",912
10087,Albert,Goosh goes up.  Yes!,912
10088,Albert,"Supermen lead 45-42. Arachneon with the steal, to Thorias. Thorias from downtown!  Yes! He's really showing us what a man with a cannon in his chest can do!",912
10089,Farnsworth,"No showboarding, you atomic hotdog!",912
10090,Albert,"And that's the half, with the Supermen up 48-42. Surprisingly dull, so far.  Bubblegum, the Trotters are down by six. Reactions?",912
10091,Tate,"It was always our plan to trail at the half, thus deepening Earth's eventual humiliation. Also, what game were the refs watching?",912
10092,Albert,"Curly Joe, easily amused by his own antics ...  ... continues to wreak havoc on--",912
10093,Farnsworth,"What the--  Did everything just jump around, or did my brain just stroke off there for a second?",912

10098,Amy,What's causing it? Is it my outfit?,912
10099,Farnsworth,No. It must have something to do with those time particles I used to grow the Supermen. Time and space are ripping apart at the seams.,912

10116,Tate,"Well I sure ain't his grandma. Now look here, Prof.  I think we got ourselves an excess of Chronitons in the subatomic interstices.",912
10117,Farnsworth,"Yes, I see. Something involving that many big words could easily destabilise time itself.",912
10118,Fry,Is that a problem?,912

10161,Farnsworth,Their gravity might just divert the Chronitons to the empty side of the universe.,916
10162,Tate,Yeah. But is it possible? Moving stars would require one bad-ass gravity pump. And we'd need all the money on Earth to--,916

10183,Leela,"Fry, please try to understand",918

10185,Leela,"Alright, but I wanna lick the beaters.",918
10186,Fry,"I got her champagne, I opened it. What does a guy have to do?",918
10187,Tate,"86 the chump stuff, F-man. It's time to win Leela's heart with a big-showy, three-point romantic gesture.",918
10188,Fry,Hmm. Maybe this is the moment to show her my real surprise.,918
10189,Leela,"Fry, what are you doing?",918
10190,Tate,Uh-oh. Time to boogie on down to the sauna!,918
10191,Fry,Look. I've been studying how to pilot the ship. Impressed?,918
10192,Leela,"Yeah, actually. You're doing OK. The core reactor temperature's nominal, the blinker's off.",918
10193,Fry,"I learned how to work the gravity pump too. In case we need to move more stars. So, are we dating now?",918
10194,Leela,"Is that what this is all about? Please, just cut it out now.",918

10203,Fry,Of course not.,918
10204,Leela,How'd you do it? Drugs in the champagne? Hypnosis?,918
10205,Fry,"No! Drugs are for losers and hypnosis is for losers with big, weird eyebrows. I don't know what amazing thing I did you make you love me but, whatever it was, we're married now. We've got the rest of our lives to work--",918
10206,Whitey,Divorce is final.,918
10207,Fry,What?,918

10209,Fry,Fine. Break my heart again.,918
10210,Zoidberg,"Don't be so hard on yourself, Fry. You lost the woman of your dreams but you still have Zoidberg. You all still have Zoidberg.",919
10211,Fry,How did I do it? How did I get Leela to love me? I've got to figure it out.,919
10212,Hermes,"Maybe you're just a fantastic lover, Fry.",919
10213,Amy,"Um, no.",919
10214,Fry,I don't know what I'm doing.,919
10215,Bender,"Maybe she'd come back to you if your best friend Bender were a Globetrotter. What do you say, Bubblegum?",919
10216,Tate,"Hell, no.",919
10217,Fry,"Oh, it's hopeless. I did something so great that it won Leela's heart and I'll never, ever know what it was. My life is empty.",919
10218,Zoidberg,Zoidberg!,919
10219,Farnsworth,No wonder we failed to stop the time skips. Diverting Chronitons is mathematically impossible. I knew I should have checked your show-boating Globetrotter algebra.,920

10227,Curly Joe,"No, man. An explosion big enough to destroy that mama would take out half the universe.",920
10228,Sweet Clyde,"You gotta Globetrotter that explosion up a little, Farnsy. Make it an implosion.",920
10229,Farnsworth,"By God, Sweet Clyde is right. An implosion might just form a black hole that would stop more Chronitons from escaping.",920
10230,Tate,"Whoa. Slow that brain train down, Prof. We'd need some kind of doomsday device to initiate an implosion like that.",920
10231,Farnsworth,Doomsday device? Ah! Now the ball's in Farnsworth's court!  I suppose I could part with one and still be feared.,920

10253,Leela,"It's OK, Fry. You know we'll always be friends, right?",922
10254,Fry,Yeah. But I don't guess anything I could do will ever make you feel the same way about me that I do about you.,922
10255,Leela,I guess not.,922
10256,Bender,"Well, the doomsday device is ready. Maybe blasting this quadrant of space into a hell storm of flaming nothingness will cheer me up a little.",922
10257,Leela,"OK. Let me just take the ship out to a safe distance.  Actually, I think I'll go down and prep the detonator. Fry, why don't you take the helm?",922
10258,Fry,She's so great. I feel like I can almost remember the magical thing I did to make her love me. But I guess I never will.,922
10259,Bender,"Sorry, buddy. I too know what it's like to have a dream I'll never achieve.",922
10260,Fry,Oh!  That's how I must have done it! I moved the stars themselves to write her a love note in the sky.,923

10632,Aaron Jr.,"OK, let's see what you can do.",949
10633,Bender,One thing she can do is lodge a ball in the depth centre of your brain. You better get a batting helmet.,949

10638,Fry,Pst. You're holding the bat upside down.,949
10639,Aaron Jr.,Just pitch the ball.,949
10640,Leela,OK. Eye off the ball.,949
10641,Bender,Strike!,949
10642,Fry,Hooray!,949
10643,Aaron Jr.,"You did it, Leela!",949
10644,Leela,I didn't hit the batter! For once I was pitching and not just belly-itching!,949

10648,Cygnoid Woman,"Yes. Our biggest seller is Leela's Bean Pizza. Six kinds of beans, plus several things that look like beans.",950

10681,Leela,Jackie. I guess you were right. I'm a lousy role model. I'm sorry.,950
10682,Jackie,"No, don't be. It turns out you were an inspiration after all.",950
10683,Leela,I was?,950
10684,Jackie,"Uh-huh. You were so awful that women everywhere set out to prove they don't stink as bad as you. You know, like a pig or something.",950

10704,Bender,What?,952

10732,Fry,Now let us each remember the best things about Bender in our own way. Professor?,953
10733,Farnsworth,Your standard bending unit is made of an iron-osmium alloy. But Bender was different. Bender had a point-04% nickel impurity.,953

10754,Bender,Come on! Surely there must be someone here who knows how great I was.,953
10755,Fry,"Yes there is, Bender. Bender was a lot of things to a lot of people. But, looking back, the number one thing I can say about him is this, and simply this",953
10756,Bender,"What? That's it? Who are you? You're nobody! This is the worst funeral ever!  I hope you're all happy. You've succeeded in convincing me life is worth living, by showing how bad my funeral will suck.",953

10762,Fry,Hi. We have a giant stone to deliver. Sign here.,955
10763,Osiran,"Ah, very nice. Much like the 10 million identical stones used in the future tomb of our great Pharaoh Hermenthotip.",955
10764,Leela,Impressive. Who's building it?,955
10765,Osiran,You.,955
10766,Leela,Say again?,955
10767,Osiran,You are now slaves of the great Pharaoh Hermenthotip. Guards.,955
10768,Fry,Call it a hunch but I've got a bad feeling about this.,955
10769,Fry,You know the worst thing about being a slave? They make you work but they don't pay you or let you go.,956
10770,Leela,That's the only thing about being a slave!,956
10771,Osiran,"Attention. You are now possessions of the great Pharaoh Hermenthotip, heir to the Tenth Dynasty, bringer of the good aspects of the annual floods.",956
10772,Fry,Incredible. This place is just like the Ancient Egypt of my day.,956
10773,Osiran,That is no coincidence. For our people visited your Egypt thousands of years ago.,956
10774,Fry,"I knew it! Insane theories, one; regular theories, a billion.",956

10777,Bender,Look at these swanky tombs! These people really know how to die.,956

10784,Bender,"Pick it up, people. We're enslaved here to do a job. Master? Do we have to count to three every time? Couldn't we just count to one. Or better yet one-half?",958

10786,Bender,Now we're slavin'!,958

11143,Enos,I did? Then I sure am lucky you knocked me onto this pile of rusty bayonets!,988

11696,Bender,"In that case brunch is served! Let's go! Move it out! Stop crying, Leela!",1051
11697,Farnsworth,"Zoidberg, are you coming?",1051
11698,Zoidberg,Sure. Me.,1051
11699,Farnsworth,Because I don't want you touching that thing.,1051
11700,Zoidberg,I know that.  Ow! What? Oh!,1051
11701,Bender,"Today, I've personalised each of your meals. For example, Amy, you're cute, so I baked you a pony.  Come on! Eat! I slaved all day over a filthy stove.",1052
11702,Hermes,This is terrible!,1052
11703,Farnsworth,Good thing I secretly installed this wormhole in the table.,1052
11704,Amy,Where does the other end come out?,1052
11705,Farnsworth,"You know, I'm not quite sure.  Oh, dear me!",1052
11706,Bender,"The pie is ready. You guys like swarms of things, right?",1052
11707,Zoidberg,"Casual hello. It's me, Zoidberg. Act naturally.  Ow! Ouch! Get off of me! Stop!",1052
11708,Leela,"How interesting, Dr. Zoidberg. Do go on.",1052
11709,Bender,"Hey, check out the palm tree! It only gets sick when I cook brunch! How's that for a coincidence, Professor? With all your precious science!",1052
11710,Fry,"Man, I don't wanna hurt Bender's feelings...",1052
11711,Fry,But this food actually tastes better as vomit!,1052
11712,Leela,It's unbearable! How much do you think it would cost to get my tongue removed?,1052
11713,Bender,And this time I mean it.,1053
11714,Bender,"Aw, who am I kidding? It was stupid of me to ever dream of becoming a chef. I don't have what it takes and nothing can change that.  Then it's settled! Elzar will teach me to cook!",1055
11715,Elzar,Absolutely not.,1056
11716,Bender,But I watch your show. You owe me!,1056
11717,Elzar,"I owe you nothing! For starter's, your antenna's in my crotch. Also, I hate you. Finally, you can't cook for squat.",1056
11718,Bender,What was the first one again?,1056
11719,Elzar,I hate you.,1056
11720,Bender,I thought that was number two.,1056
11721,Elzar,I knocked it up a notch. Bam!,1056
11722,Zoidberg,"Aw, I'll never recombobulate this ship! When the Professor finds out, he'll tear me a new cloaca.  Frame someone!",1057
11723,Fry,What up?,1057
11724,Fry,Sunshine!,1058
11725,Bender,It's over! My dream of being a chef is deader than the cat I'm sitting on!,1059
11726,Dandy Jim,"Gus, old chum, let's give a friendly welcome to this new robo.",1059
11727,Bender,What did you call me?,1059
11728,Gus,A robo. You know? A robot-hobo.,1059
11729,Bender,"Oh, OK. I thought you said ""romo"".",1059
11730,Dandy Jim,"No offence intended, my filthy friend. In fact, why not join us and ride the space rails?",1059
11731,Gus,Get ready. We's gonna jump off at that switching prism up ahead.,1060
11732,Dandy Jim,"We're going nearly the speed of light so, uh, roll when you land.",1060
11733,Bender,Ow.,1060
11734,Gus,"Welcome to Bumbase Alpha, the biggest hobo jungle in the quadrant.",1061
11735,Bender,"I've seen bigger. Oh, wait, I'm thinking of Eugene, Oregon.  Wait. A pie with hobo-lifting aroma? Who baked it?",1061
11736,Gus,Helmut Spargle. He used to be the greatest chef ever.,1061
11737,Dandy Jim,"His restaurant was so high-toned, the only way to get reservations was to create a parallel universe where you already had reservations.",1061
11738,Gus,Yep. I once ate there back when I what was a senator.,1061
11739,Bender,"Yo, Spargle. If you're such a great cook, how'd you end up in this dump?",1061
11740,Spargle,Ages ago I was the host of a TV show...,1061
11741,Spargle,Down Home Country Kitchen Mit Helmut Spargle. But one day the extreme soda company that sponsored the show decided it was too old-fashioned.,1061
11742,Man,"Spargle, you're fired! We need a chef who can attract today's younger more extreme cooking show viewer.",1061
11743,Spargle,Elzar!,1061
11744,Elzar,"Get lost, old man! Bam!",1061
11745,Spargle,Mein soufflé!,1061
11746,Spargle,"Elzar had been seduced by the dark side of cooking. Cilantro, mango salsa, raspberry vinaigrette!",1061
11747,Bender,That twizzler!,1061
11748,Spargle,"As for me, I went temporarily insane and vound up here, making pies out of shoes.",1061
11749,Bender,My story's a lot like yours only more interesting 'cause it involves robots. That jerk Elzar ruined my dream of being a chef too.,1061
11750,Spargle,"Interesting. You wish to become a cook, but as a robot you have no sense of taste.",1061
11751,Bender,"It's so unfair! I have eight other senses, but I'd trade them all, even smission, to be able to taste.",1061
11752,Spargle,"You don't understand. Without the distraction of taste, your mind is free to touch the Zen of pure flavour. You could become the greatest chef ever.",1061
11753,Bender,I could?,1061
11754,Spargle,Yes. Just as Beethoven was a great composer because he was deaf.,1061
11755,Bender,Or like how Rembrandt was blind and had wooden hands.,1061
11756,Spargle,"Bender, hear me well. I shall train you. But first, you must forget everything you know about cooking.",1061
11757,Bender,Done.,1061
11758,[Montage,Bender trains as a chef to Joe Esposito's,1061
11759,Farnsworth,"That's right, Ricardo. A ship in a bottle! What's that? Well hang on, I'll look.",1062
11760,Ricardo,Ola? Professor? Qué pasa?,1062
11761,Farnsworth,I've gathered you all here in the accusing parlour because one of you is a miniature ship wrecker.,1063
11762,Zoidberg,I'm acting astonished.,1063
11763,Farnsworth,Certain clues suggest that the culprit is none other than our own ... Philip J. Fry!,1063
11764,Fry,What?,1063
11765,Farnsworth,"Oh, it was a brilliant scheme. But you made one fatal mistake ... leaving this confession note.",1063
11766,Zoidberg,"Fry, you scoundrel!",1063
11767,Fry,"Well, I don't remember any of that but I don't have the wherewithal to defend myself.",1063
11768,Farnsworth,Then I have no choice but to charge you the full cost of the materials,1063
11769,Fry,There you go.,1063
11770,Zoidberg,What have I done?,1063
11771,Spargle,"Your training is complete, little dessert spoon. Now, just as the man who wishes to be world chess champion must win at least one game of chess, so must you serve at least one edible meal.  of perfect flavour.",1064
11772,Gus,"Ooh, yeah!",1064
11773,Bender,Slop's on!,1064
11774,Gus,Fine lookin' eats!,1064
11775,Spargle,It is ... acceptable.,1064
11776,Bender,"Yahoo! Another thing I'm great at! Wait. Why'd you stop eating, master?",1064
11777,Spargle,Because ... my stomach is about to explode.,1064
11778,Bender,"What? My dinner killed you? Oh, man!",1064
11779,Spargle,"And using this, you cannot fail.",1064
11780,Bender,A diamond vial of Mrs. Dash?,1064
11781,Spargle,Oh! There goes my ... life.,1064
11782,Bender,"I'll avenge you, master. I swear, in the presence of these drunken bums, that I shall defeat Elzar!",1064
11783,Gus,"Oh, I'm not drunk, I'm mentally ill. But I likes what what you said!",1064
11784,Bender,"Elzar, I'm a walking pile of your unfinished business!",1065
11785,Elzar,"Why, you--",1065
11786,Bender,"Helmut Spargle has a message for you. He says  ""Ooh, I'm dead!""",1065
11787,Elzar,"Spargle, huh? What he do, bland himself to death?",1065
11788,Bender,No. He was eating some food I made and by a crazy coincidence his stomach exploded. Now I'm here to avenge him.,1065
11789,Elzar,"OK, but it seems like you're the one who killed him.",1065
11790,Bender,Maybe so but you are his sworn enemy. I challenge you to a battle of the chefs.,1065
11791,Customer,Scandalous!,1065
11792,Elzar,Very well. We'll meet on the ancient televised battleground of Kitchen Coliseum. Whosever meal is best will claim the title of Iron Cook.,1065
11793,Bender,"Iron Cook, eh? I can't lose. I'm 30% iron!  You're going down! Uh, also I had a reservation for one, under ""Dr. Bender"".",1065

11806,Koji,Soylent Greuu!,1067
11807,Hiroki,"Soylent Green, a classic ingredient of gourmet cooking. And the battle is on.  Aki, what's Elzar making?",1067
11808,Aki,"Well, Hiroki-san, when I asked him, he asked what business it was of mine and conjectured that my mother was a prostitute.",1067
11809,Stewart,In the English countryside many prostitutes decorate their rooms with festive gourds.,1067
11810,Female Announcer,30 minutes to go.,1067

11819,Zoidberg,"Oh, the guilt! The unbearable guilt!",1067

11821,Elzar,Bam!,1067
11822,Female Announcer,Ten seconds.,1067
11823,Bender,"Master Spargle, if you can hear me up there in that ditch where I left you, this is for you.",1067
11824,Koji,Time uperuu!,1067
11825,Hiroki,The iron cook Neptunian has gone all out to please the judges. He's even garnished the salad with $100 bills. Let's see what they think.,1067
11826,Tate,Mmm. Soylent green is my kind of people!,1067
11827,Morbo,Scrumptious. Morbo will store this in his sack for future digestion.,1067
11828,Stewart,I'm swimming in my own soylent waste. It's a good thing.,1067
11829,Hiroki,"Next up, challenger Bender. A student of the legendary Helmut Spargle, Bender is some sort of wonderful mechanical man.",1067
11830,Stewart,"Ooh, delicious!",1067
11831,Tate,"This food looks kind of funky, but it tastes kind of fun-kay!",1067
11832,Morbo,The challenger's ugly food has shown us that even hideous things can be sweet on the inside.,1067
11833,Hiroki,"And now, judgement. The winner will become the new iron cook, the loser is doomed to scrub.  Whose confection will achieve perfection? Whose foodstuff will be the good stuff?",1067

11835,Fry,Yay!,1067

11839,Bender,"Chairman-san, I came here with one goal",1067
11840,Elzar,No question.,1067
11841,Bender,"But the true Zen of flavour is not found in a coliseum. It is found in a small kitchen, with friends. That is why I decline the title of Iron Cook and accept only the lesser title of ""Zinc Saucier"", which I just made up. Also, it comes with double prize money.",1067
11842,Zoidberg,Wait! Everyone must know,1067
11843,Koji,Oh! That sword cost 5000 dolluu!,1067
11844,Zoidberg,Fry did it!,1067
11845,Bender,"And that's how I defeated Elzar, thanks to Spargle's magic liquid.",1067
11846,Leela,"Yes, we were there. And we just finished watching it again on TV.",1067
11847,Farnsworth,"Hmm. Let me see that vial, Bender.  Good Lord! According to the spectrolizer, Spargle's magic ingredient was ... water. Ordinary water!",1067
11848,Hermes,No!,1067
11849,Fry,"Ah, so the real gift Spargle gave you was confidence. The confidence to be your best.",1067
11850,Farnsworth,"Yes, ordinary water. Laced with nothing more than a few spoonfuls of LSD.",1067
11851,Bender,"The important thing is, by my standards, I won fair and square. Now, who wants brunch? Cooked with plenty of ... ""confidence""?",1067

11871,Amy,You're going to Nigel 7? Kif's on patrol near there. You could drop me off on the way.,1068

11948,Kif,Leela must have impregnated me when she grabbed my ungloved hand. That explains the poster in hygiene class,1082
11949,Leela,"Wow, this is all so confusing.",1082
11950,Zapp,"Leela! How could you? Our love has had to endure your constant hatred, and now this?  Stop testing our love!",1082
11951,Kif,"Please, Captain. I thank Leela for the DNA she gave me but, in my species, the true parent is the one who inspired the initial feeling of love. We call that person the ""smizmar"". And my smizmar is Amy.",1082
11952,Zapp,So the toilet seat is like the uncle or something?,1082
11953,Leela,Sorry I got your boyfriend pregnant.,1083
11954,Amy,"That's OK. At least Kif's baby shower should be fun. I'd better put it on my calendar.  Might as well plan for my new life while I'm at it. Set ""Motherhood Mode"".",1083
11955,Leela,To motherhood.,1083
11956,Bender,Zoidberg?,1084
11957,Fry,"You know, my face was stuck in a pizza.",1084
11958,Amy,"Mom, Dad, I know this is weird but--",1084
11959,Mrs. Wong,"Yeah, yeah. We don't care how squishy alien get pregnant. All we care is that we have grandchild now.",1084
11960,Kif,"You're very open-minded, Mrs. Wong.",1084
11961,Mr. Wong,"Hey! You call her ""Grandma"" now!",1084
11962,Mrs. Wong,Call me Grandma like crazy! All the time!,1084
11963,Fry,"Check it out, y'all. Everyone we invited is here.",1084
11964,Zoidberg,Also Zoidberg!,1084
11965,Fry,So let's open the gifts.,1084
11966,Bender,Alright!,1084
11967,Kif,"I can't wait! Let's start with this one, from Bender.",1084
11968,Bender,It's my booties from when I was a kid.,1084
11969,Amy,"Uh, they're already bronzed.",1084
11970,Bender,They are bronze.,1084
11971,Kif,"And this one's from Leela. Oh, I just love the bow! I wonder what it is!",1084
11972,Zapp,"Yes, I wonder what we got you.",1084
11973,Kif,It's a basket! F-For picnics?,1084
11974,Leela,It means a lot to me. It's the basket my parents left me in at the orphanarium.,1084
11975,Hermes,You could use it for picnics.,1084
11976,Mrs. Wong,"Here, Amy. We get this one for you.",1084
11977,Amy,Is it a new party board?,1084
11978,Mrs. Wong,It's a board alright! An ironing board.,1084
11979,Mr. Wong,We had your old party board converted now that you not be partying anymore.,1084
11980,Amy,You-You trashed my party board?,1084
11981,Mrs. Wong,"Damn right! Now you're a mom, the only surfing you do is under a big wave of responsibility.",1084
11982,Kif,"Oh, this is the happiest moment of my life! You all brought such wonderful gifts. But the greatest gift--",1084
11983,Bender,Mine!,1084
11984,Kif,"Is the bond I share with my smizmar, Amy. For soon, the quivering mass of life within me will depend on us both.  Even now, I can sense it feeding, squirming, searching, questing. And shortly, it will rend my loins in twain, burst forth and pull us down, down, down into the deep, dark waters of commitment.",1084
11985,Zoidberg,That's so beautiful!,1084
11986,Amy,No! I can't do this!,1084
11987,Bender,"Oh, my God!",1084
11988,Kif,"Oh, how could Amy leave me? When will women learn to take responsibility for the children they've helped create?  The quickening! My time is near. I must return to my homeworld to perform the ancient birthing rites.",1084
11989,Scruffy,Lemme know how that turns out.,1084
11990,Kif,I must now embark on a perilous journey to give birth in precisely the same swamp in which I was born.,1085
11991,Leela,"If it's so dangerous, I'd better go with you. A gal has to protect her DNA.",1085
11992,Kif,"No, Leela. Tradition demands that I make this journey with my smizmar. And since Amy isn't, here I must go it alone. Farewell, for we may never meet again.",1085
11993,Kif,My scrapes feel a little better now.,1085
11994,Bender,"Hey, what's this fat ugly thing? A frog? A toad? Or your momma!",1085
11995,Kif,It's a poisonous froad! No one move.,1085
11996,Bender,"I'm back, baby!",1085
11997,Kif,Behold! The sacred ancestral birthing grounds of my family.,1086
11998,Zapp,Smells like a jockstrap!,1086
11999,Grand Midwife,I am the Grand Midwife.,1086
12000,Fry,Hi!,1086
12001,Kif,"I am Kif, of the clan Kroker, come to bear my young.",1086
12002,Grand Midwife,"Then let the Tea of New Life be brewed.  As it is writ, ""and both shall lift the jug together"". Where is your smizmar?",1086
12003,Kif,She's not with me.,1086
12004,Grand Midwife,"Oh, the sorrow. Oh, the shame. I'm sorry, I'm probably just making you feel worse.",1086
12005,Kif,As long as Amy is with me in my heart I will have the strength of two.  Apparently Amy hasn't been working out much lately.,1086
12006,Grand Midwife,"As the tea boils, please join hands with your beloved smizmar.  Oh, right, sorry. But I memorised the ceremony by rote and it mentions her a lot.",1086
12007,Kif,I'll try to endure.,1086
12008,Grand Midwife,"Good, 'cause I'm not changing it. Now turn ye to and gaze deeply into each other's eyes.",1086
12009,Bender,What are you looking at?,1086
12010,Grand Midwife,"May the love I sense between you at this moment remain with you both through all your days.  The Tea of New Life is ready. Let those whose love created this life speak each other's names, then drink.",1086
12011,Kif,Amy.,1086
12012,Amy,Kif!,1086
12013,Kif,Amy! Is it you or have I gone crazy with loneliness?,1086
12014,Bender,Both.,1086
12015,Amy,I still don't know if I'm ready for this but I do know I love you. And I wanna be here beside you.,1086
12016,Grand Midwife,Great! Now I lost my place! I'm starting over!,1086
12017,Kif,"Oh, no time! It has begun!  Oh, my!",1086
12018,Bender,Neat!,1086
12019,Amy,"You can do it, Kif!",1086
12020,Kif,"Whoa, Nellie!",1086
12021,Bender,"Oh, man!",1086
12022,Kif,"Amy, my love, tell me",1086
12023,Leela,Amy!,1086
12024,Amy,Shoo! Stay away from my babies!,1086
12025,Grand Midwife,The birthing is complete!,1086
12026,Bender,Alright!,1086
12027,Kif,"Oh, thank goodness!",1086
12028,Grand Midwife,"I will now take my leave. I live here so I won't actually be going anywhere, but you don't have to talk to me anymore.",1086
12029,Fry,Congratulations!,1086
12030,Zapp,Nice work!,1086
12031,Bender,"Way to go, squishy!",1086
12032,Leela,There goes my DNA. What a disgusting and beautiful process.,1086
12033,Fry,That's birth for you.,1086
12034,Kif,"Well, we've given them a great start, Amy. And in 20 years they'll sprout legs and crawl back onto land as children.",1086
12035,Amy,I'll be ready then.,1086
12036,Farnsworth,"Good news, everyone! You all know the orphanarium where Leela grew up?",1087
12037,Fry,Sure. We talk about it all the time.,1087
12038,Leela,Really?,1087
12039,Fry,No. Burn!,1087
12040,Farnsworth,"Well done, fellows! Anyway, said orphanarium has named Leela ""Orphan of the Year"".",1087
12041,Amy,Yee-ha!,1087
12042,Bender,Alright!,1087
12043,Amy,Your parents must be so proud. Oops! Sorry.,1087
12044,Farnsworth,And the good news keeps on coming. Behold my latest invention.,1087
12045,Bender,Neat!,1087
12046,Farnsworth,Ta-da! It's a glow-in-the-dark nose you can wear over your regular non-glowing nose. Observe.,1087
12047,Amy,"Whoa, clool!",1087
12048,Bender,Now I can punch you in the nose in the dark.,1087
12049,Bender,Where'd it go?,1087
12050,Amy,"Hey, Professor, what's all this scloop, glorking out of the machine?",1087
12051,Farnsworth,"That? It's, uh ... nothing. Yes, nothing. If you think it's anything, you're a suspicious moron.",1087
12052,Hermes,It looks like toxic waste.  And it smells like toxic waste.,1087
12053,Fry,What does it taste like?,1087
12054,Hermes,"Delicious fig pudding! Ooh, that's good! But a distinct aftertaste of toxic waste.",1087
12055,Farnsworth,"Alright, alright, so the machine produces a few toxic by-products! You don't have to make a federal case out of it.",1087
12056,Hermes,I'm afraid I do.  I order you dispose of that toxic waste properly or bribe me. Either way it'll cost $500.,1087
12057,Bender,"500 real dollars? That's an outrage! Professor, I'll take care of that waste for $499 and 100 cents.",1087
12058,Farnsworth,"Hmm, I know that's a rip but I'll pay for the convenience. Do you take credit cards?",1087
12059,Bender,Let's find out.,1087
12060,Bender,"Alright, environment, you've met your match!",1088
12061,Smitty,"Hey, get back in the sewer, weird-y. No mutants on the surface.",1088
12062,Vyolet,But he ruined my wedding dress.,1088
12063,Bender,"Honey, that thing was ruined the minute it went on you. That's what I'm talkin' 'bout.",1088
12064,Vogel,"Y'know, it's not easy being an orphan -- not if I have anything to do with it.  I'll never forget the night that cute little alien baby was abandoned on our doorstep. Because I have a photographic memory and I remember every night!",1089
12065,Vogel,"What the--? An alien language? I guess you're an alien. What a beautiful gigantic eye you ha--  Well, come on in.",1089
12066,Vogel,"From those humble beginnings, Leela went on to become a county-certified starship captain. And so it is my pleasure today to nail her picture alongside those of our most distinguished alumni.",1089
12067,Leela,"Thank you very much. Like many of you, I never knew my parents...",1089
12068,Vogel,Give me a--,1089
12069,Leela,I don't know if they were mighty alien overlords or simply underpaid alien janitors who fought crime on the side--,1089
12070,Vogel,There we are. Picture's up.,1089
12071,Bender,It's crooked!,1089
12072,Leela,"In the end though, it doesn't matter who my parents were. All that matters is what I learned here, within these unscalable walls, that I have strength to make it on my own, just like all of you kids here today.",1089
12073,Kids,Leela! Leela! Leela!,1089
12074,Nina,Look at me! I'm Leela!,1089
12075,Albert,Nuh-uh! 'Cause I'm double Leela!,1089
12076,Vogel,"That's it, Albert, no more espresso for you.",1089
12077,Photographer,"Mind if I get a picture of you with your picture for the news, ma'am?",1089
12078,Leela,Yes! I mean no! Just make sure you get my nonchalant side!,1089
12079,Fry,"If those aren't tears of happiness, please stop crying.",1090
12080,Leela,"It's OK, Fry. I'm fine. I won an award today.",1090
12081,Fry,"Is it this room that's making you sad? It's probably the room. Come on, let's go for a walk.",1090
12082,Leela,"I'm sorry you saw that, Fry. I usually try to keep my sadness pent up inside where it can fester quietly as a mental illness.",1091
12083,Fry,"Yeah, I do that with my stupidness.",1091
12084,Leela,"I told a whole crowd today that being an orphan made me strong. But all I really wanted was a mom and dad, to hold me and stroke my hair and tell me they loved me.",1091
12085,Fry,"Then today's your lucky day, because I happen to be a holding, stroking, lovin' machine! Also spankin'.",1091
12086,Leela,That's not even close to what I had in mind.,1091
12087,Fry,"Well, anyway, just remember that people care about you.",1091
12088,Leela,"I know.  Sometimes, when I'm lonely, I look up at the sky and I get this feeling that somewhere, on some unknown planet, circling a distant star, my parents are up there, looking down on me.",1091
12089,Fry,"Yo, yo, Bezender! What up?",1091
12090,Bender,My dumping business is booming. I just got hired to clean up the set of Free Willy 3.,1091
12091,Leela,"Bender! Cut it out! First of all, the sewer mutants will be mad. Second, everything else that's horribly wrong with what you're doing!",1091
12092,Bender,"Ah, those stupid mutants can't do anything. You seem to be forgetting one simple fact. Namely, I'm up here and they are safely down--",1091
12093,Bender,What did I do to deserve this?,1092
12094,Dwayne,"Behold, our once beautiful mutagenic sewage lake.",1092
12095,Vyolet,The radioactive waste you dumped in it has made it bright enough to see how ugly we really are.,1092
12096,Dwayne,"Oh, man!",1092
12097,Raoul,As if our lives weren't miserable enough already!,1092
12098,Leg Mutant,Tell me about it!,1092
12099,Raoul,Let the punishment commence!,1092
12100,Leela,Punishment?,1092
12101,Fry,No fair!,1092
12102,Bender,Bender's innocent!,1092
12103,Raoul,"The instant you touch these mutatious waters, your DNA will be forever altered, turning you into horrible mutants like us. Especially him!  Allow me to demonstrate!",1092
12104,Fry,It's like that time I peeked in the kitchen at Imperial Hunan.,1092
12105,Raoul,Submerge the prisoners.,1092
12106,Bender,Wait. I don't even have DNA. Why am I screaming?,1092
12107,Dwayne,We're gonna beat you afterwards.,1092
12108,Mutants,Mutate! Mutate! Mutate! ...,1092
12109,Hooded Figure #1,Turanga Leela!,1092
12110,Leela,Who said that? How do you know my real name?,1092
12111,Bender,Whee!,1092
12112,Raoul,What are you doing? Stop it!,1092
12113,Fry,What happened?,1092
12114,Leela,I don't know. I think I saved us somehow.,1092
12115,Raoul,Go after them! The waters can't mutate us mutants!,1092
12116,Raoul,They went this way!,1092
12117,Bender,Quick! In there!,1092
12118,Dwayne,Kill! Kill! Kill!,1092
12119,Leela,Great Cheech's ghost!,1092
12120,Bender,What's this junk?,1092
12121,Leela,It looks like ... a timeline of my whole life.,1092
12122,Fry,That's when we saved Earth from a giant asteroid of garbage.,1092
12123,Leela,And here's when I dropped out and bummed around India for a while.,1092
12124,Bender,And this is just last year at Space Mardi Gras.,1092
12125,Leela,It's like some kind of weird Leela museum ... and I'm the Leela!,1092
12126,Fry,Dude! Over here!,1092
12127,Leela,It's all the best stuff I ever flushed down the toilet! Those are some of my diary pages. And my screenplay!,1092
12128,Fry,"And also, for some reason, the letter I wrote you full of my personal feelings.",1092
12129,Leela,My whole life has just been a show for some perverted mutant!,1092
12130,Vyolet,They must be in here.,1092
12131,Raoul,"Yeah, after them.",1092
12132,Bender,And then Bender ran!,1092
12133,Fry,"Leela, freak out later. We're not done escaping yet!",1092
12134,Dwayne,Got you!,1092
12135,Leg Mutant,Take this!,1092
12136,Fry,Ow!,1092
12137,Raoul,This time I'm calling for the death penalty. And not just because I'm running for re-election as Supreme Mutant.,1093
12138,Mutants,Four more years! Four more years!,1093
12139,Raoul,"Oh, very well.  Your attention. Instead of being tortured to death, the prisoners shall hereby be expelled from the sewers and never allowed to return.",1093
12140,Bender,"Oh, cruel fate! Can we really never return to this dank pit of sewage?",1093
12141,Leela,Wait a minute. Why aren't you gonna kill us anymore?,1093
12142,Bender,Yeah! What are you chicken?,1093
12143,Fry,"Shut up, you two! We can kill ourselves when we get home!",1093
12144,Raoul,They'll need transportation to the surface. Bring in the airship.,1093
12145,Bender,Ew!,1093
12146,Raoul,"We constructed it from the remnants of old discarded Macy's parade balloons. Underdog's groin, Bart Simpson's left ear and right shin, Garfield's owner Jon's forehead.",1093
12147,Mutant #1,Fire up the sewer gas!,1093
12148,Mutant #2,"Move it, you ugly normals!",1093
12149,Bender,"Uh, I'm gettin' dizzy! I can't walk straight!",1093
12150,Fry,"Come on, Leela. You can do it!",1093
12151,Bender,Hurry! We're missing our bus!,1093
12152,Fry,Whoa! What are you doing?,1093
12153,Bender,I'm gettin' on the bus!,1093
12154,Leela,The lake didn't mutate me. What is going on here?,1093
12155,Octopus,It worked for me. I used to be a little blonde girl named Virginia.,1093
12156,Leela,Eurgh!  Who the hell are you?,1093
12157,Hooded Figure #1,"No one. And watch your language, young lady!",1093
12158,Mutant #2,Stop right there! I don't want to hurt you.  I didn't want you to hurt me either!,1093
12159,Fry,Leela's going nuts and I can't save her unless I learn more about her mysterious past. Isn't there anything else you can tell me?,1094
12160,Vogel,Nah. Nothing that wouldn't be a waste of your time.,1094
12161,Fry,That's impossible because my time is worthless!,1094
12162,Vogel,"Huh. Well then there is one thing.  It's the note I found with Leela the day she was abandoned. But it's written in Alienese, so no one on Earth can translate it. Not even Brainzilla.",1094
12163,Fry,Hand it over.,1094
12164,Vogel,Sure.  I just wish I could be more helpful. Would you like some dirt on any other orphans?,1094
12165,Fry,"Look, I'm trying to save someone here. I'll have to come back for those later.",1094
12166,Fry,Can you translate it?,1095
12167,Farnsworth,"Of course. But only into Beta Crypt 3, a language so complex there's even less chance of understanding it.",1095
12168,Fry,I didn't ask for a completely reasonable excuse. I asked you to get busy.,1095
12169,Farnsworth,Very well.,1095
12170,Fry,Isn't that the same machine that makes noses?,1095
12171,Farnsworth,"It can do other things. Why shouldn't it?  Of course, even if it is possible to analyse the message, there's no way of knowing how long it would take. It could take an hour or it could take a hundred million years.",1095
12172,Fry,Is it done?,1095
12173,Farnsworth,Certainly not. Two dings means it's done.  But not like that. Slightly more rapid.,1095
12174,Leela,Where did they go?,1096
12175,Bender,"Good news, Leela. I landed the contract to empty all the spittoons in Little Italy.",1096
12176,Leela,Ew!,1096
12177,Farnsworth,That's it! It's done!  I can't believe it! My mind is boggling. The analysis of the note is printing out now.,1097
12178,Doctor,It's a girl.,1097
12179,Mother,My God! She's beautiful. No extra anythings.,1097
12180,Father,Good people skills!,1097
12181,Mother,She's completely perfect!,1097
12182,Doctor,"In my professional opinion as an ear, ear, ear, nose and throat doctor, she is the least-mutated mutant ever born.",1097
12183,Father,And yet she's cursed to live the horrible degrading life of a mutant. Like all of us. Especially him!,1097
12184,Leg Mutant,It's true!,1097
12185,Mother,Maybe we can do better for her.,1097
12186,Father,"I made this bracelet so that in some small way we'll always be with you, even when it doesn't seem like it. During your entire life, for example.",1098
12187,Mother,"You won't pass for human, cutie. But if my PhD in exo-linguistics is worth diddly-poop, this note should convince them you're an alien.  And that'll be enough to give you a real life.",1098
12188,Father,She'll never know we're her parents.,1098
12189,Mother,That's our gift to her. Better we should die than have her learn the shameful truth of her origin.,1098
12190,Father,I'm with you.,1098
12191,Vogel,"What a beautiful gigantic eye you ha--  Well, come on in.",1098
12192,Hooded Figure #1,Keep quiet so she doesn't hear us.,1099
12193,Hooded Figure #2,What's there to talk about?,1099
12194,Hooded Figure #1,Sh!,1099
12195,Leela,Hands up!  Tentacles too!,1099
12196,Hooded Figure #1,"Don't say anything stupid, Morris.",1099
12197,Leela,What is all this?  Am I a game to you? Or some kind of even more boring Truman Show? Do you believe I'm you Messiah? Your Mutant Dalai Lama? Stop me if I guess it!,1099
12198,Hooded Figure #2,"Well, actually, there--",1099
12199,Hooded Figure #1,Morris! Sh!,1099
12200,Leela,"How did you get this bracelet? Did you steal it from me when I was a baby? Or from my parents? You robbed my parents, didn't you? I bet you sick mutants killed them. My parents were confused aliens lost on Earth and you killed them! Is that it? Admit it!",1099
12201,Hooded Figure #2,Yes. We killed them.,1099
12202,Hooded Figure #1,You guessed the truth.,1099
12203,Leela,Because of you I'll never know my parents. I'll kill you!,1099
12204,Hooded Figure #1,That would be best.,1099
12205,Fry,"Stop!  Thanks, Bender! Don't do it, Leela!",1099
12206,Leela,They killed my parents!,1099
12207,Fry,Close.,1099
12208,Leela,They are my parents.,1099
12209,Munda,Yes.,1099

12467,Leela,Hmm. I have been looking for a way to serve the community that incorporates my violence. Let's do it!,1128
12468,Fry,You'll barely regret this!,1128
12469,Bender,"Hey, a friend of mine said he mugged you today and you had superpowers.",1128
12470,Leela,It's true. Thanks to this funky-fresh cream.,1128
12471,Fry,Now me and Leela are forming an awesome crime-fighting duo.,1128
12472,Bender,"Wow! Crime-fighting. Cool. You say you're a duo? Yeah, duos are good. Of course sometimes they're a little short-handed.  I have these three costumes you could use. But I guess I'll just throw one away.",1128
12473,Leela,"We'd love to have you on the team, Bender. But aren't you more on the supply side of crime?",1128
12474,Fry,Plus the cream won't give you superpowers. You're a robot.,1128
12475,Bender,So? I'm already super-strong. And my arms do this.  Also I got this going.,1128
12476,Leela,"Listen up, New New York",1129
12477,Hattie,Quiet! It's 4am and I just fell asleep for the first time in 30 years!,1129
12478,Leela,A new era of justice has begun.,1129
12479,Hattie,What?,1129
12480,Narrator,"Attention, all crooks, lowlifes and lawbreakers. Do yourselves a favour and crawl back into your filthy tenements, you human cockroaches. Or get your ugly face punched to custard by ... The New Justice Team.",1130
12481,Fry,Captain Yesterday!,1130
12482,Leela,Clobberella!,1130
12483,Bender,And Superking! The best one of the three!,1130

12489,Song,Captain Yesterday!,1130
12490,Song,"Superking has all the powers of a king,Plus all the powers of Superman,Also he's a robot,Ain't it cool?Superking, you rule!",1130
12491,Song,"Clobberella beats you up,Clobberella beats you up,Who does she beat up?You!",1130
12492,Song,Clobberella!,1130

12496,Bender,Ta-da!,1130
12497,Woman,"Captain Yesterday, I find your skintight high-waters incredibly sexy. Let's get together sometime.",1131
12498,Fry,Sure. I'm listed in the phone book so once I reveal my real name to you along with my home address and a copy of my birth certificate--,1131
12499,Leela,Are you crazy? We have to keep our secret identities secret.,1131
12500,Fry,From everybody?,1131
12501,Leela,Especially from everybody.,1131
12502,Fry,Give several reasons why.,1131
12503,Leela,"For one, superheroes cause a lot of collateral damage, and we don't wanna get our butts sued.",1131
12504,Fry,"Or do we? No, I guess not.",1131
12505,Leela,"Also, if our identities get out, every crook in the city will be after us. Or, God forbid, our loved ones.",1131
12506,Bender,"Superking has no need for loved ones.  How ya doin', kid?",1131
12507,Poopenmeyer,There you go. Two one-day mutant surface passes.,1132
12508,Leela,"Thank you, Mayor Poopenmeyer.",1132
12509,Poopenmeyer,Mayor here. What's that? Horrible crime in the works? Ruthless villain? Citizens in danger? That's fantastic news!  Because I get to summon the New Justice Team!,1132
12510,Leela,Sh!,1132
12511,Poopenmeyer,"Uh, they're usually here by now.",1132
12512,Leela,"Well, so long. Keep in touch.",1132
12513,Poopenmeyer,"Wait, stay and meet the superheroes. There's three of you and three of them so it'll be perfect.  Is this clown on? Where are those daring crime stoppers?",1132
12514,Leela,"Oh, I completely forgot. I left my apartment on fire!",1132
12515,Bender,"Uh, as for me, I'm late for my LSAT's.",1132
12516,Fry,And I can't take life anymore.,1132
12517,Poopenmeyer,Clobberella! Captain Yesterday! My liege! You're just in time.  We've received a tip that the Museum of Natural History will be robbed tomorrow at exactly 9am. The target,1132
12518,Fry,Who's the perp?,1132
12519,Poopenmeyer,"A dangerous villain known as The Zookeeper, who commits crimes aided by a pack of highly-trained animals.",1132
12520,Fry,Pack of highly. Got it!,1132
12521,Poopenmeyer,"His crew includes a badger with a troubled past and nothing left to lose, an elephant who never forgets -- to kill! And a seldom-used crab named Lucky, a.k.a. Citizen Snips.",1132
12522,Leela,"You can count on us, Mr. Mayor. Justice away!",1132
12523,Bender,Hold the elevator!,1132
12524,Bender,We're in here too.,1133
12525,Fry,"Uh, Leela, how you gonna meet your folks tomorrow? We've already scheduled the Zookeeper for a 9am foiling at the museum.",1133
12526,Leela,Not a problem. I've cleverly arranged to meet my parents right there at the same museum at 10.,1133
12527,Bender,"9, 10 a big fat hen.  The name's Bender!",1133
12528,Leela,I can't believe the Zookeeper is this late for his own heist. It's just rude!  There they are!,1134
12529,Munda,How could Leela not be here? Do you think she forgot?,1134
12530,Morris,Relax. I'm sure she's just ashamed of us.,1134
12531,Security Guard,"Yo! Freakjobs! Hit the nearest manhole, pronto, like.",1134
12532,Morris,But we have passes that allow us to be up here. From the mayor himself.,1134
12533,Security Guard,I dunno. I never heard of no mayor.,1134
12534,Randy,The Zookeeper!,1134
12535,Zookeeper,Sorry I'm late. Long story. Now everybody hit the deck! I'm cutting the entire line and stealing the exhibit.,1134
12536,Leela,You're not stealing anything! Nobody hit the deck!,1134
12537,Zookeeper,"Ah, the superheroes. Or should I say superzeroes!",1134
12538,Fry,That was uncalled for.,1134
12539,Zookeeper,"Animals, attack.",1134
12540,Tour Guide,Please do not feed the animals!,1134
12541,Bender,"You're going down, my friend! Down Under!",1134
12542,Roosevelt,Man boxing a kangaroo is a peculiar spectacle. But a kangaroo boxing a robot? Now I'm afraid you've lost me.  Citizen Snips!,1134
12543,Zookeeper,"Nice job, Fingers!",1134
12544,Munda,I'm scared and confused. I think we've wandered into an off-Broadway play.,1134
12545,Morris,"No, there are way too many people here.",1134
12546,Zookeeper,"Later, if anyone asks when I got away, tell them right now!",1134
12547,Leela,"Forget it, Zookeeper! You're going into captivity.",1134
12548,Zookeeper,"Fool! A quip about putting me behind bars would have been far more delicious. Here, catch!",1134
12549,Leela,"No, Fry! You can't fall fast enough!",1134
12550,Bender,"I got it, I got it!  I don't got it!",1134
12551,Roosevelt,You've saved the Gemerald!,1134
12552,Fry,"Yet the Zookeeper escaped, thus proving that the deadliest animal of all is the Zookeeper.",1134
12553,Bender,You can get off me anytime.,1134
12554,Leela,"Oh, no! My parents are leaving. I've gotta go change back into street-Leela.",1134
12555,Photographer #1,It's the New Justice Team!,1134
12556,Photographer #2,Can we get some photos?,1134
12557,Poopenmeyer,"Thank you, mysterious heroes. The value of the Gemerald you saved is slightly greater than the cost of the damage you caused to this museum. A net gain for our great city!",1134
12558,Munda,It's good that Leela doesn't love us. She'll be less sad when we die.,1135
12559,Leela,Mom? Dad? I showed up! And I got the audio tour for Treasures of Liberace's Tomb.,1135
12560,Morris,"Sweetie, it's OK. You don't have to apologise for standing us up on the only visit to the surface we'll ever have.",1136
12561,Leela,"I wanna tell you why I didn't show up, but I can't. Just please believe me that it was a very good reason. I'm sorry I disappointed you.",1136
12562,Munda,"Leela, you could never disappoint us.",1136
12563,Morris,"We're so proud of everything that you are, and we always will be. Because you're our baby girl.",1136
12564,Leela,"Oh, I can't take it! Mom, Dad, I'm Clobberella!",1136
12565,Morris,Galloping gators!,1136
12566,Munda,You're a superhero?  Well that's wonderful! But did you have to make the costume so revealing?,1136
12567,Morris,Look at me! Proud dad of a superhero! We should print up T-shirts. And F-shirts for our friends with two arms on the same side.,1136
12568,Leela,"No, listen. It's very important that you never, ever tell anyone under any circumstance.",1136
12569,Morris,What if I've had a few?,1136
12570,Leela,"Dad, you drink? No. Not even then.",1136
12571,Morris,Alright. My sucker is sealed.,1136
12572,Leela,"In fact, I shouldn't even be wearing this around here.  It was brisk, I dressed in layers.",1136
12573,Munda,That's my girl!,1136
12574,Morris,"So, uh, anyway, my daughter's Clobberella.",1137
12575,Raoul,Leela is Clobberella?,1137
12576,Leg Mutant,You're pulling me!,1137
12577,Morris,Sh. keep it under your sock. It's a big secret. That's why I'm only telling you two.,1137
12578,Big-Eared Mutant,"Oh, my God! That guy's daughter is Clobberella. But don't tell anyone.",1137
12579,Big-Mouthed Mutant,Gotcha!,1137
12580,Zookeeper,"Greetings, superheroes. Remember me?",1138
12581,Farnsworth,"I don't remember much, buddy. And you're no looker!",1138
12582,Leela,"Uh, Professor, isn't it time for your nap?",1138
12583,Farnsworth,"Yes, damnit!",1138
12584,Leela,Zookeeper! How did you know our real identities?,1138
12585,Zookeeper,Let's just say a little bird told me.,1138
12586,Parrot,Leela told her parents. Leela's parents blabbed.,1138
12587,Fry,"Leela, is the person that parrot is mimicking telling the truth by proxy?",1138
12588,Leela,"Yes. My parents were so hurt, I couldn't help it! But I distinctly told them not to tell anyone.",1138
12589,Bender,We are not amused.,1138
12590,Zookeeper,And here's something you may or may not find interesting.,1138
12591,Leela,Mom! Dad!,1138
12592,Munda,"Leela, please forgive us! Especially your father who's the one who told. Thank you very much, Morris.",1138
12593,Leela,Are you alright? Has he hurt you?,1138
12594,Morris,"Oh, God!",1138
12595,Munda,Every couch and table has animal fur all over it. He lets them climb on everything!,1138
12596,Leela,"Alright, Zookeeper. What do you want?",1138
12597,Zookeeper,"Why, the Quantum Gemerald of course! You must steal it for me before midnight or your parents will be devoured by piranhas that I have, shall I say, persuaded to walk on dry land.",1138
12598,Munda,"Save us, Leela! I mean, if you don't have anything better to do.",1138
12599,Leela,We're out of options. We have to steal the Gemerald!,1138
12600,Fry,"But, should superheroes commit a crime, even to save lives? I need moral guidance. Bender?",1138
12601,Bender,"Hmm. The thought of stealing anything fills Superking with disgust. But if it must be so, then let a museum heist be pulled!",1138
12602,Fry,"Oh, no! Our superpower cream is out of itself!",1139
12603,Leela,Check inside the cap. There might be a caked-in goldmine.,1139
12604,Fry,El zilcho! I'm afraid we're boned.,1139
12605,Bender,El zilcho? Is it too late to change my superhero name?,1139
12606,Leela,Just be cool. Nobody knows we're super-powerly challenged.,1140
12607,Fry,"Man, this costume is so damn heavy!",1140
12608,7¹¹ Clerk,"Hey, Captain Yesterday? Can I, like, wail on you with this 2-by-4 and it doesn't hurt you?",1140
12609,Fry,Ow! That ... didn't hurt.,1140
12610,Security Guard,"Hi, superheroes. Everything OK?",1140
12611,Leela,"Big O, little k, my friend! Just checking if everything's alright.",1140
12612,Security Guard,"It's OK, alright!",1140
12613,Leela,"OK, then. Grab it!",1140
12614,Tate,Yo! The superheroes have turned evil! Most uncool.,1140
12615,Security Guard,Get 'em!,1140
12616,Leela,"Stay back! Or we'll, beat the tar out of you ... using superpowers!",1140
12617,Fry,So this is your lair?,1141
12618,Zookeeper,Of course not. You think I'd show you my lair? My lair's a million times nicer than this!,1141
12619,Fry,"OK, take it easy!",1141
12620,Bender,"Well, here's your lousy Gemerald.",1141
12621,Zookeeper,Hawk! Fetch!,1141
12622,Fry,That seemed unnecessary.,1141
12623,Zookeeper,"Our transaction is complete. Come, Solomon. To the lair.",1141
12624,Leela,"Mom! Dad! Oh, I'm so sorry I got you kidnapped by a crazy madman who tried to feed you to piranhas.",1141
12625,Munda,We're just happy to be involved in your life.,1141
12626,Leela,"No, no. It's my fault for telling you I was a superhero.",1141
12627,Morris,That's true.,1141
12628,Leela,I just couldn't stand to have you to think I was ashamed of you.,1141
12629,Munda,"That's sweet, honey. But it's natural for children to be a little ashamed of their parents.",1141
12630,Fry,"Oh, yeah!",1141
12631,Morris,Just like it's natural for parents to be a little disappointed in their children-- N-Not that we are.,1141
12632,Munda,But you could call a little more often.,1141
12633,Leela,OK.,1141
12634,Munda,And would it kill you to use some mouthwash?,1141
12635,Bender,"Hey, Fry, we've still got our costumes on. Wanna steal some more stuff?",1141
12636,Fry,"I guess, as long as you think it's right.",1141
12637,Bender,Superheroes away!,1141
12638,Song,"Go, go, go, New Justice Team,Fighting justice is their quest,Superking, Clobberella, and all the rest,Here's to you, New Justice Team,Do the things that make your team,Help each other do some things,Winners don't use drugs,The New Justice Team!",1141
12639,Zoidberg,"Freedom, freedom, freedom, oy!Freedom, freedom, freedom, oy!",1142

12642,Zoidberg,There's nothing crazy about it. It's just Freedom Day!,1142
12643,Farnsworth,...an extremely dangerous mission...,1143
12644,Fry,"So, what is Freedom Day? Sounds like some kind of feminine hygiene product.",1143
12645,Zoidberg,"No, it's a fabulous, crab-ulous day!",1143
12646,Amy,"If you wanna do something, you do it, and to splick with the consequences!",1143

12648,Hermes,Happy Freedom Day! Ooh! I think my wrist is broken.,1143
12649,Farnsworth,"Of course, it wouldn't be Freedom Day without the traditional Freedom Tub!",1143
12650,Hermes,Mmm! That'll feel nice on my shattered bones!,1143
12651,Fry,Wow! Nude hot-tubbing? That's all I need to hear about Freedom Day!,1143
12652,Zoidberg,Then consider the following lecture a bonus,1143
12653,Decapodian Woman,"Sure, you can be a comedian instead of a doctor -- if you want your parents to roll over in their graves!",1143
12654,Decapodian Man,"Sure, you can vote for Shkinadel -- if you want there should be a recession!",1143
12655,Decapodian Woman,"Sure, you can go to medical school -- if you've given up on your dream of being a comedian!",1143

12977,Bender,"Whoa, whoa, whoa! You can't censor me just 'cause I'm an obscenely bad role model.",1172
12978,Leela,"As unclean as it makes me feel, I agree with Bender. Kids don't turn rotten just from watching TV.",1172
12979,Fry,Yeah. Give a little credit to our public schools.,1172
12980,Cubert,"Our dads are all pumped up on dork-osterone. We're just trying to be cool, like Bender.",1173
12981,Dwight,"Yeah, and it's not even working. Smoking and drinking make us barf.",1173
12982,Tinny Tim,Gentle jerkwads. I know how to emulate Bender without barfing. We could commit a burglary.,1173

12984,Cubert,Bender loves to burgle!,1173
12985,Dwight,"Hold up, though. Who could we rob? We don't even know anyone with cool stuff.",1173
12986,Cubert,Duh! We know someone who runs on pure cool fuel,1173
12987,Dwight,Whoa!,1173

12999,Zoidberg,I'm networking. Let me give you my card.,1176

13001,Farnsworth,Hmm. There's something wrong with your story but I can't put my finger on it.  Of course! You don't have friends!,1176

13209,Farnsworth,Not necessarily. For the dog may yet survive.,1193
13210,Fry,May yet? Really?,1193
13211,Farnsworth,"Indeed. You see, that fossil was made of dolomite; The tough black mineral that won't cop out when there's heat all about. By contrast, observe the lava's affect on this ice swan.  Of course, that would have melted even at room temperature. I just wanted to get rid of it. But had it been made of that righteous mineral dolomite, there's a slim chance it might have survived.",1193
13212,Fry,So Seymour might still exist?,1193
13213,Farnsworth,"Perhaps, for a few minutes. It's dolomite, baby!",1193
13214,Fry,Then I'm goin' in after him.,1193

13219,Fry,"Then all hope is lost.  Goodbye, Seymour.",1193
13220,Bender,"Please stop crying, Fry. Here.  I assumed you were just pretending to love the dog to toy with my emotions. Oh, what have I done?",1193
13221,Zoidberg,You didn't do anything. Don't beat yourself up.,1193
13222,Bender,"Fry, I'm sorry. I should have understood how someone can love an inferior creature, because I love you. Not in the way of the Ancient Greeks, but the way a robot loves a human, a human loves a dog and, occasionally, a gorilla loves a kitty.  I'm goin' in!",1193
13223,Farnsworth,I'm a professor! Why isn't anyone listening to me? You can't go in because you'll melt. The fossil only has a chance because it's made of dolomite.,1193
13224,Bender,"I'm 40% dolomite!  Oh, it's hot! It's very hot!",1193
13225,Cryogenisist,Ugh! I am one hungover cryogenisist. Just throw that mutt in the freezer till his owners get here.,1193

13499,Morris,"Fine, Sweetiekins, we'll be the strictest parents ever. Now, let's all have some tequila to celebrate!",1222
13500,Leela,Dad! I'm underage!,1222
13501,Morris,"Oh, right. Here's a silly straw.",1222
13502,Mrs. Wong,"Oh, my Amy's sweet little girl again! This is like a mother's dream. Bad dream, that is! At this rate, I'm never going to get a grandchild!",1223
13503,Mr. Wong,Maybe she not grown up but she sure grown out! She fat!,1223
13504,Amy,"Dad, if you're gonna make fat jokes till I get cute again, I'm just gonna stay in my room.",1223
13505,Mr. Wong,"Stay in room? You so fat, you gonna stay all around room!",1223
13506,Farnsworth,I've got to find a way to escape the horrible ravages of youth. Suddenly I'm going to the bathroom like clockwork every three hours. And those jerks at social security stopped sending me checks. Now I have to pay them!,1224
13507,Bender,"I'm tired of your yapping.  All you ever do is complain, you never try to make things better. Well, I'm running away from this dead-end family! I know there's a place for people like me with new ideas. There has to be!",1224
13508,Farnsworth,Fine! Get going!,1224
13509,Bender,"Oh, I'm going! You're gonna be all ""Where's Bender? I miss Bender"".",1224
13510,Farnsworth,We won't know that until you leave.,1224
13511,Bender,"Oh, I'm leaving!",1224
13512,Farnsworth,There's the door.,1224
13513,Bender,I'll be good.,1224
13514,Munda,"Ah, do you have to shed your skin on the couch? What do we live in, a zoo?",1225
13515,Morris,I'm getting the doorbell.  For me?,1225
13516,Fry,"Oh, uh, hello, sir. It's a lovely evening you have tonight. Um, I'm here to pick up your daughter.",1225
13517,Leela,"Hi, Fry! I like your blazer.",1225
13518,Fry,"Thanks. These aren't pockets, they're just flaps. I put my money in my sock.",1225
13519,Munda,"So, where are you taking my daughter tonight?",1225
13520,Fry,"A movie, ma'am.",1225
13521,Morris,"Well, whatever you're really doing, don't wake us if you get in after 12.",1225
13522,Leela,"Dad, you're being too lenient again! I have to be back by 11.",1225
13523,Munda,"OK, OK. You're the boss!",1225
13524,Leela,"No, I'm not!",1225
13525,Fry,I'd like a sewer burger but without the rat faeces.,1226
13526,Leela,"What are you, on a diet?",1226
13527,Moose,"Uh, Leela, you look hot.",1226
13528,Mandy,"Jeez, Moose! Just dump me right in front of her, why don't you.",1226
13529,Leela,"Moose, Mandy; this is my friend Fry, from the surface.",1226
13530,Mandy,"Oh, so this is the famous Fry. What is he, like, the biggest loser on the surface so he has to hang out in the sewer?",1226
13531,Fry,They're onto me!,1226
13532,Leela,"Hey, come on! Let's act like grown-ups here. Wanna race?",1226
13533,Moose,"Uh, yeah!",1226
13534,Sal,Theres. The world's drinkings water is safes for another days.  Cripe!,1226
13535,Leela,A tapeworm!,1226
13536,Fry,We missed the turn. We'll never catch them.,1226
13537,Leela,"Yes, we will. This sewer goes right under Planet Express, and it's 9pm!",1226
13538,Farnsworth,The devil take this predictable colon!,1226
13539,Fry,Yeah!,1226
13540,Leela,Alright!,1226
13541,Fry,"Leela, you can stop winning now. We won!",1226
13542,Leela,I'm too short to reach the handbrake!,1226
13543,Dwayne,That's detention!,1226
13544,Fry,"And then, and then, this giant tapeworm tried to play us for chumps but we like totally dissed Moose!",1227
13545,Farnsworth,"Yes, I'd like to meet this Moose. But, in the meantime, I have good news. I may have solved our age problem.",1227
13546,Fry,Yay!,1227
13547,Farnsworth,"It seems the Youthasizing tar was saturated with time-altering Chronitons. A thin layer is still stuck to our DNA as well as Bender's robo, or ""RNA"".",1227
13548,Bender,Question.,1227
13549,Farnsworth,Yes?,1227
13550,Bender,You stink!,1227
13551,Farnsworth,"Yes, yes. Anyhow, I've designed an oil-eating bacterium that should take the tar right off.",1227
13552,Fry,C'mon! Let's go tell Leela so we can grow up together!,1227
13553,Leela,"Thanks, Professor. But I don't want the treatment.",1228
13554,Farnsworth,"Don't you understand, you little nitwit? Unless you're treated soon, the only way to restore your true age would be to grow into it! Just as God intended.",1228
13555,Munda,"He has a point, honey. What about your job and your friends? Do you really want to abandon your old life?",1228
13556,Leela,"My old life wasn't as glamorous as my webpage made it look. All I ever wanted was to grow up here, with you. Please?",1228
13557,Munda,Well if it's what you really want.,1228
13558,Leela,It is. I know it is.,1228
13559,Fry,"I'll miss you, Leela. I'll come back and visit when I'm all grown up.",1228
13560,Leela,Bring beer.,1228
13561,Morris,No beer till you finish your tequila!,1228
13562,Farnsworth,The age-restoring microbes are ready. Everyone into the bacterial spew chamber.,1229
13563,Amy,Let's go!,1229
13564,Bender,"Yes, everyone do the same thing!",1229
13565,Farnsworth,Initiating controlled infection.,1229
13566,Zoidberg,"I'm no doctor, but this machine guy could use a lozenge.",1229
13567,Amy,"Aw, pooh! We're even younger!",1229
13568,Farnsworth,"Day-umn! The bacteria pigged-out on the tar and now they're getting freaky-deaky, spreading Chronitons throughout our systems. We're getting younger by the minute!",1229
13569,Amy,Yikes!,1229
13570,Zoidberg,What? I'm going to revert through all my larval stages?,1229
13571,Farnsworth,Word! We'll all keep getting younger and younger until we suffer a fate worse than death,1229
13572,Farnsworth,"I've got to stop this reverse-aging before we all shrivel up and suffer the agony of un-birth. Think, you disco duck, think!",1230
13573,Amy,What's that squirmal under your shirt?,1230
13574,Farnsworth,"Get off me, you parasitic lamprey!",1230
13575,Zoidberg,"Oh, sure, like you need all your blood.",1230
13576,Farnsworth,"Would you all chill! I can't think with you kids cramping my style! Oh, I need a babysitter.",1230
13577,Leela,"OK, quiet time. I know, everyone pretend a goblin ate your tongue and I'll read you a story.",1231
13578,Zoidberg,"I can't see from down here, I can't.",1231
13579,Leela,There. Today's story is from New Teen magazine. What would you rather hear about? Four-legged Chachi or tentacled Chachi?,1231
13580,Fry,I wanna hear a space story!,1231
13581,Leela,"It's kind of a baby book. But OK. Let's see. Snow White Dwarf And The Seven Red Dwarves, Charlotte's Tholian Web, The Fountain Of Aging.",1231
13582,Farnsworth,"The Fountain of Aging? Hmm. It is just a legend. Still, they called the Tooth Fairy a legend and now he's head of the FBI.",1232
13583,Farnsworth,Sup? Kids ready?,1233
13584,Fry,Professy's back!  And drinking.,1233
13585,Farnsworth,I had a few beers but I'm cool to drive.,1233
13586,Leela,"I wish I could come with you to say goodbye, before you all turn back in to grown-ups but I'm grounded for knocking the school over.",1233
13587,Munda,"Who cares, Leela? It was just a public school. Now go with your friends, please.",1233
13588,Leela,No! A grounded teenager must be confined to her room!,1233
13589,Leela,Until she sneaks out!,1234
13590,Bender,"When I grow up, I wanna be a steam shovel!",1234
13591,Leela,"According to this, the Fountain is located in the darkest, most ancient region of space, just past Teddy Bear Junction.",1235
13592,Farnsworth,Teddy Bear Junction,1235
13593,Farnsworth,"This solar system is, like, way old.",1236
13594,Leela,Look how high the asteroid belt is pulled up on that planet.,1236
13595,Farnsworth,"Newsflash! Everything's getting older the closer we get to that ancient, burnt-out sun.",1236
13596,Leela,"Dude, the Fountain of Aging must be on the sun itself.",1236
13597,Farnsworth,Shut up! I was gonna say that!,1236
13598,Leela,We've got to hurry. The kids have only one change of pants!,1237
13599,Farnsworth,"We gotta be real, real careful to stay in just long enough to make us our right ages again.  Zoidberg! Get out of there!",1237
13600,Zoidberg,"The current! It's too much, already! Help!",1237
13601,Farnsworth,Jeepers!,1237
13602,Leela,Zoidberg is dead!,1237
13603,Zoidberg,No! Zoidberg's brother is dead!  Funny story,1237
13604,Sibling #1,He always had to be the centre of attention!,1237
13605,Sibling #2,Let him go!,1237
13606,Leela,"Oh, no!  Quick! Get them into the fountain!",1237
13607,Farnsworth,"Thanks for the help, Weewa. Once we're gwown up, you can go back to your famiwy. We'wl never bother you again.",1237
13608,Leela,"Well, you could bother me a little.",1237
13609,Farnsworth,It's working! Hooray!  I can't hold on!,1237
13610,Leela,I'm coming in after you!,1237
13611,Farnsworth,"No, Leela! You can't give up your childhood! You'll never have another chance at it!",1237
13612,Fry,We did it! We're the right ages again!,1237
13613,Leela,I think I might be a couple years younger.,1237
13614,Amy,"Oh, me too!",1237
13615,Farnsworth,"Help! I'm still in mid-peril, you clods!",1237
13616,Leela,He's too far out! We can't reach him!,1237
13617,Farnsworth,"Pazuzu! Oh, you came back to me!",1237
13618,Hermes,"Are you back to your original age, Professor?",1237
13619,Farnsworth,Even older! Huzzah!,1237
13620,Fry,"I'm sorry you had to give up being a kid, Leela.",1237
13621,Leela,"Well, I guess every adult wants to be a kid again sometimes. But I worked hard to be the person I am.",1237
13622,Fry,The fabulous person!,1237
13623,Leela,With friends like you guys--,1237
13624,Fry,Fabulous friends!,1237
13625,Leela,And I'm really happy I have that life back.,1237
13626,Farnsworth,"And you, my faithful fiend! How can I ever repay you?",1237
13627,Pazuzu,"And zat, little one, is how Papa gained his freedom. Now, bonne nuit, bonne nuit to you all!",1238
13628,[Scene,Planet Express,1239
13629,Fry,"Delivery boy Philip J. Fry, reporting for duty.",1239
13630,Zoidberg,"Dr. Zoidberg, soaking in brine.",1239
13631,Fry,"What is the meaning of this? We've got a delivery, people. Let's move! Let's move!  Interesting, interesting. Dr. Zoidberg, mission bag?",1239
13632,Zoidberg,"Packed and ready, sir.",1239
13633,Fry,What's this? This is the same toy surprise I got last time!  I can't work under these conditions. And without me there is no mission. I am the mission!,1239
13634,Leela,We're back from the mission!,1239
13635,Fry,Wh-What? You went without me?,1239
13636,Bender,You were looking up curse words in the dictionary. It seemed like a better use of your time.,1239
13637,Fry,But-- But I'm the delivery boy.,1239
13638,Leela,Don't worry. Everything went fine.,1239
13639,Bender,Better than usual!,1239
13640,Leela,"We got medals! Good work, team! We really pulled together on this one.",1239
13641,Zoidberg,They got medals.,1239
13642,Fry,I'm real sorry I missed the mission. I wasn't there and you might have needed me.,1240
13643,Bender,Nope.,1240
13644,Fry,But if I'd been there I--,1240
13645,Bender,Nope.,1240
13646,Fry,Look--,1240
13647,Bender,Nope.,1240
13648,Fry,Bender's great--,1240
13649,Bender,Nope!,1240
13650,Fry,"Listen, Leela, let me make it up by taking you out to dinner tonight.",1240
13651,Leela,Nope.  I've got a date with Chaz.,1240
13652,Fry,Chaz?,1240
13653,Leela,I met him at that charity cock fight last week. He's the mayor's aide.,1240
13654,Bender,"Ooh! You go, mutant girl!",1240
13655,Leela,I do go! He's a very important man.,1240
13656,Fry,So? I'm just as important as him.  don't do it.,1240
13657,Fry,I'm nobody. There are guys in the background of Mary Worth comics who are more important than me.,1241
13658,Bender,"Ah, buck up, meatloaf. Bender'll take you out tonight and cheer you up. What do you wanna do? And I mean anything. You have the power! Name it and I'm there. You the man!",1241
13659,Fry,"Um, OK. Let's go bowling.",1241
13660,Bender,Nah.,1241
13661,Elzar,Table for two? Step right this way.,1242
13662,Chaz,"I'm afraid we don't have a reservation but, uh, as you can see ...  ... I'm the mayor's aide. Table for two, please.",1242
13663,Elzar,OK then.,1242
13664,Elzar,Bam!,1243
13665,Chaz,"It's OK, my man. I got you covered on your next health inspection.",1243
13666,Elzar,"I really appreciate that, mister mayor's aide.  Here you go. Compliments of the house.",1243
13667,Leela,Wow! Free bread at a restaurant? Is there anything you can't do?,1243
13668,Chaz,I can't fail the mayor. Not ever.,1243
13669,Fry,"Oh, jeez! Better not let Leela see me.",1244
13670,Leela,"Hey, I hear Fry.  Boy, am I glad you're here.",1244
13671,Fry,You are? So things aren't working out with whatshisname?,1244
13672,Leela,"Actually ... they are! Confidentially, I might not make it back to my apartment tonight! Could you walk Nibbler for me?",1244
13673,Fry,Um ... uh...,1244
13674,Leela,And bring a baggy in case he drops a steamer.  Have a great night!,1244
13675,Fry,"Oh, no! Please! No!  Perfect!",1245
13676,Smitty,Whoa! Smells like a 289 in progress.,1245
13677,URL,"Failure to scoop. Aw, yeah!",1245
13678,Fry,Wait! I'm trying. It weighs as much as a thousand suns.,1245
13679,Chaz,"Don't worry, Fry. I'll pull some strings -- see if I can't get you tried as a juvenile.",1245
13680,Leela,"Oh, Chaz!",1245
13681,Fry,I'm as worthless as this trash can.,1246
13682,Trash Can,"You think I'm as worthless as you? Try catching garbage in your head and raising six kids, you dumb townie!",1246
13683,Fry,"Oh, Nibbler, at least I'm important to you. Even if it's only 'cause I clean up you poop.",1246
13684,Nibbler,The poop eradication is but one aspect of your importance.,1246
13685,Fry,D-D-Did you just talk?,1246
13686,Nibbler,Indeed. And I have other amazing powers as well.,1246
13687,Fry,Like what?,1246
13688,Fry,Are you my mommy?,1246
13689,Nibbler,Negative.,1246
13690,Fiona,"Welcome, Lord Nibbler.",1248
13691,Nibbler,Welcome acknowledged. I bring with me ... the Mighty One.,1248
13692,Fry,Eh?,1248
13693,Ken,"At last, our centuries upon centuries of waiting have achieved fruition.",1248
13694,Fry,Aw! Aren't you a fuzzy wittle guy?,1248
13695,Ken,"Stop that! Uh, please. Your Mightiness--",1248
13696,Fry,Mightiness? Are you off your nut? I just got kidnapped by a bunch of guinea pigs.,1248
13697,Ken,Does he not know?,1248
13698,Nibbler,He does not know.,1248
13699,Fiona,He knows not?,1248
13700,Nibbler,Knows not does he.,1248
13701,Nibblonian,Not he know--,1248
13702,Ken,"Enough! Fry, it is my duty to inform you that the fate of humanity, the fate of our race, indeed the fate of all that exists and ever will exist rests with you. You are the single most important person in the universe.",1248
13703,Fry,"Oh, snap!",1248
13704,Nibbler,"On this auspicious occasion, let the horn of eternity cut a thunderous blast.",1248
13705,Fiona,The Feast of a Thousand Beasts is begun.,1248
13706,Nibblonian,You gonna eat that?,1248
13707,Fry,Maybe later.,1248
13708,Ken,The time has come to discuss matters of the gravest importance.,1248
13709,Nibbler,"Fry, do you remember some months ago when the Earth was attacked by flying brains?",1248
13710,Fry,Hmm. I remember the square-dancing stomachs. Although that might have been a Mylanta commercial. Wait! The brains! I do remember! But no one else does. They said I was crazy.,1248
13711,Ken,On the contrary. You remember because you were the only one immune to the Brains' mental attack.,1248
13712,Fry,Because I'm so smart?,1248
13713,Ken,"Oh, my. Anyway, your immunity is due to the fact that you lack the delta brainwave.  It's a genetic abnormality which resulted when you went back in time and performed certain actions which made you your own grandfather.",1248
13714,Fry,I did do the nasty in the past-y!,1248
13715,Nibbler,Verily. And that past nastification is what shields you from the brains. You are the last hope of the universe.,1248
13716,Fry,So I really am important? How I feel when I'm drunk is correct?,1248
13717,Ken,Yes. Except the Dave Matthews Band doesn't rock.,1248
13718,Nibbler,"For a thousand years, the evil Brains have been constructing the Infosphere, a giant memory bank twice the size of three ordinary memory banks.",1249
13719,Fry,What's so evil about that?,1249
13720,Fiona,They plan to collect all the information in the universe and store it in the sphere.,1249
13721,Fry,So they're trying to learn things?,1249
13722,Fiona,Right.,1249
13723,Fry,Those bastards!,1249
13724,Nibbler,"Being Brains, they feel compelled to know everything. And soon they will.",1249
13725,Fry,I'm as mad as I've ever been.,1249
13726,Ken,"Once their task is complete, they will ensure that no new information arises in the only way possible",1249
13727,Fry,Now it's personal.,1249
13728,Fiona,"Your mission is to infiltrate the Infosphere and plant this quantum-interface bomb, blasting them into an alternate universe from which there is no return.",1249
13729,Nibbler,Then outrun the blast on this Scooty-Puff Jr.,1249
13730,Fry,"OK, let's go through this once more--",1249
13731,Fry,Brains!,1249
13732,Ken,"Fear not, Mighty One. Your missing brainwave makes you invisible to them, so long as you avoid intense thinking.",1249
13733,Fry,"Sorry, what? I wasn't paying attention.",1249
13734,Ken,That is most wise.,1249
13735,Fry,Who?,1249
13736,Ken,"In a few seconds, the Brain will finish scanning the last bits of information in the universe.",1249
13737,Infosphere,"Beavers mate for life; 11 greater than 4; for quality carpets, visit Kaplan's carpet warehouse.",1249
13738,Ken,"Now the Infosphere will open its protective crust so as to scan itself, completing its thousand year task.",1249
13739,Fiona,This is your one chance to enter the sphere. Scoot! Scoot now!,1249
13740,Fry,I'm at the input console. I'm a little nervous and I've got brain in my buttcrack.,1249
13741,Nibbler,Roger.,1249
13742,Ken,"Once you press the detonator, you will have 60 seconds for an exciting escape.",1249
13743,Fry,"Hey, wait. This brain knows everything about everything, right?",1249
13744,Ken,It will soon. That's why you're supposed to be setting off a bomb.,1249
13745,Fry,"Yeah, yeah. But I can't pass up a chance to learn the answers to the greatest questions of all time.  Is it true that postage stamp glue is made of--",1249
13746,Huge Brain,Correct. Toad mucus.,1249
13747,Ken,There's no time for this. Activate the bomb.,1249
13748,Fry,"Wait, wait, wait.  What really killed the dinosaurs?",1249
13749,Huge Brain,Me!,1249
13750,Computer Voice,Unauthorized data access.,1249
13751,Fry,Uh-oh!,1249
13752,Big Brain,Detecting trace amounts of mental activity. Possibly a dead weasel or a cartoon viewer.,1249
13753,Fry,Ew! Gross. Cut it out!,1249
13754,Brain #1,Odd. He is immune to our psionic attack.,1249
13755,Brain #2,Impossible! We're an ambitious young squad with everything to prove.,1249
13756,Big Brain,"It appears we are in the presence of the fabled one. But without his Scooty-Puff Jr., he cannot escape.  Huh?",1249
13757,Brain #2,A quantum-interface bomb? Are you insane in the membrane?,1249
13758,Fry,"You got it, poindexter!",1249
13759,Brain #1,"Oh, not good!",1249
13760,Computer Voice,Detonation in T-60 Earth seconds.,1249
13761,Brain #3,You fool! You'll be transported to the other universe with us. Trapped there for all eternity.,1249
13762,Brain #1,And we'll form a tightly-knit clique that you won't be part of!,1249
13763,Fry,Well at least I did one important thing with my life,1249
13764,Nibbler,Yay!,1249
13765,Ken,Exactly!,1249

13768,Nibbler,"No! Don't ask about that! It-It would be, uh ... boring!",1249

13776,Fry,What the--,1249
13777,Fry,I-- I don't understand. You made me go in the freezer tube?,1249
13778,Computer Voice,Detonation in T-15 seconds.,1249
13779,Fry,You little runts froze me! You took away my life!,1249
13780,Nibbler,We can explain!,1249
13781,Fry,"No, you can't. Shut your adorable trap!",1249
13782,Nibbler,We had no choice. You were the only one who could help us. What is one life weighed against the entire universe?,1249
13783,Fry,But it was my life.,1249
13784,Computer Voice,"Detonation in two, one. Will the owner of a white Pontiac Firebird-- Oh, never mind. Zero!",1249
13785,Big Brain,"Well, here we are. Trapped for eternity.",1251
13786,Brain #2,We could sing American Pie.,1251
13787,Fry,Go ahead. I deserve it. I wish those stupid racoons had never brought me to the future.,1251
13788,Huge Brain,I have shocking data relevant to this conversation.,1251
13789,Big Brain,"We don't care, you dope! We're in another universe. You're not in charge anymore.",1251
13790,Huge Brain,"It is possible for the Philip Fry to resume his life on December 31st, 1999.",1251
13791,Fry,Really? I can go back in time?,1251
13792,Huge Brain,There is a nexus point between universes at the space-time where you entered the cryogenic tube. You and only you can return there.,1251
13793,Big Brain,Interesting. You could stop the Nibblonian from pushing you into the cryogenic tube.,1251
13794,Fry,That is interesting. Why?,1251
13795,Big Brain,It would be as if you never came to the future. You will have your life back and we will succeed in our plan to understand and destroy the universe.,1251

13798,Narrator,Meanwhile.,1252
13799,Leela,I love rocket skating! But the wait is always so long. Poor Fry once stood in line for six hours just to get me a ticket.,1252
13800,Chaz,Six hours? Pft! Sounds like a real nobody! But now it's time for somebody and some chick he's with to go skating.,1252
13801,Leela,You reserved the whole rink?,1252
13802,Chaz,"Yup. Buzzed ahead, let 'em know whose aide was coming by. The mayor's, that's whose.",1252

13807,Chaz,What? Seriously? I'm trying to impress you with my clout here.,1252
13808,Leela,"I know, and it's working. But think how much skating would mean to those kids.",1252
13809,Nina,We came here instead of eating today.,1252
13810,Leela,This may be their only chance to skate in their whole lives. Who are we to say they can't?,1252
13811,Chaz,"The mayor's aide, and his badge.  Beat it, kids! Come back when you got connections!",1252
13812,Vogel,"Alright, little ones, back to the orphanarium. You can slide around the gym in your socks.",1252

13823,Fry,Gotcha!,1255
13824,Nibbler,I don't understand.,1255
13825,Fry,"Yes, you do! You came back in time to knock me into that freezer and now I came back in time to stop you.",1255
13826,Nibbler,I did not come back in time. My people lack that ability.,1255
13827,Fry,But ... I know you in the future. I-I cleaned your poop.,1255
13828,Nibbler,Quite possible. We live long and are celebrated poopers. You will meet me when I'm a thousand years older.,1255
13829,Fry,Not if you don't freeze me.,1255
13830,Nibbler,"Please. Our saviours foresee that in a thousand years, for one moment, the fate of the universe will depend on you. Since you will not live that long I must freeze you now.",1255
13831,Fry,"Well, why couldn't you just ask me?",1255
13832,Nibbler,We were afraid you would refuse.,1255
13833,Fry,Of course not. I love the future.,1255
13834,Nibbler,Then why are you choking me right now?,1255
13835,Fry,Because I don't like being used.,1255
13836,Nibbler,Well now it's your choice. Is there nothing in the future worth saving?,1255
13837,Fry,Hm. Leela. But she doesn't think much of me.,1255
13838,Nibbler,"Ah, she must be The Other.",1255
13839,Fry,What?,1255
13840,Nibbler,"You must not give up on her. I am stationed on a distant world known as Vergon 6. But, if you return to the future, I will transfer to Earth to give you what help I can.",1255

13844,Crowd,One.,1255
13845,Fry,"Yes! Here I come, future! Oh, no! Wait! I'm gonna get trapped in the Infosphere again! Just remember that Scooty-Puff Jr. sucks.",1255
13846,Nibbler,"In a thousand years, I'll get right on it.",1255
13847,Narrator,"And so, a thousand years later, Fry once again infiltrated the Infosphere and set off his amazing bomb. Only this time...",1256
13848,Nibbler,"Thank you for saving the universe, Fry.  Here.",1257
13849,Fry,"Whoa, thanks! If you ever need a saviour again, just ask.",1257
13850,Nibbler,"Oh, we will. We will.",1257
13851,Fry,"Man, I can't wait to tell everyone what happened.",1257
13852,Nibbler,"Uh, yes. Incidentally, I need to remain undercover so I'm blanking your memory.",1257
13853,Fry,"Huh. Did everything just taste purple for a second? Oh, well. Let's go home, you dumb poop machine.",1257
13854,Leela,"Bender, would you do the honours?",1258
13855,Bender,With gusto.,1258
13856,Fry,"Hey, Leela. I guess I got this for you.",1258
13857,Leela,"Oh. Thank you. You know what, Fry? I don't care if you're not the most important person in the universe. It really makes me happy to see you right now.",1258

13877,Zoidberg,Shut your gills!,1260
13878,Bender,That sound! It's patrol car 718! Hide him!,1260
13879,Zapp,The court is intrigued. Perhaps we could hear more about these forbidden words from someone with a sexily seductive voice.,1260
13880,Takei,"With pleasure. You see, the show was banned after the Star Trek wars.",1260
13881,Zapp,You mean the vast migration of Star Wars fans?,1260

13916,Bender,"Yeah, why is this so important to you?",1261
13917,Fry,"'Cause it-it taught me so much. Like how you should accept people, whether they be black, white, Klingon or even female. But most importantly, when I didn't have any friends, it made me feel like maybe I did.",1261

14042,Shatner,"Oh, that's good, good, good, good. And then, George, you give them a karate chop!",1271
14043,Takei,I find that offensive. Just because I'm of Japanese ancestry you assume I know karate. Have I ever led you to believe I've studied karate?,1271

14315,Leela,But the bee stung you. It barely touched me.,1297

14556,Mom,"Quite frankly, Robot 1-X will put all my previous models to shame. Incidentally, would one of my previous models mind coming up here?",1314
14557,Bender,"Right here! I'm comin'! C'mon, baby! I'll do it! C'mon, Mom!",1314
14558,Refreshment-bot,Jerk!,1314
14559,Bender,"Here we go. I'm your top of the line, Mom.",1314
14560,Mom,Notice that this obsolete robot runs on alcohol and emits pollution. Whereas Robot 1-X runs on pollution and emits pure oxygen with a fresh pine scent.,1314
14561,Bender,"Man, that smells great!",1314
14562,Mom,"Now, let's see how both robots do at a typical household task",1314
14563,Robot 1-X,"Task completed. Total value, $4.73 and one Albanian lek.",1314
14564,Mom,"Very good, Robot 1-X. And you, bending unit?",1314
14565,Bender,"Uh, I never got the change.  Suckers.",1314
14566,Mom,Presenting Mom's Friendly Robots.,1314
14567,Bender,"That new robot is great, huh? Sure made me look like a pile of crap!",1314
14568,Farnsworth,Indeed. That's why I bought one to help around the office.,1314
14569,Bender,Eep!,1314
14570,Leela,"Let's try him out. Robot 1-X, can you clean Nibbler's stanky litterbox?",1315
14571,Robot 1-X,I can and will.,1315
14572,Bender,"Hey, I could have done that if you'd asked me.",1315
14573,Leela,I asked you five minutes ago.,1315
14574,Bender,"You call that a kiss? I'll show you!  C'mere, Nibbler!",1315
14575,Farnsworth,"Oh, look, Bender. If you want something to do stop making out and give us a hand.",1315
14576,Hermes,Here. Go up on the roof and install this fake satellite dish so we can impress the neighbours.,1315
14577,Bender,"Yes, sir. I'm on it!",1315
14578,Hermes,"Oh, and have Robot 1-X help you.",1315
14579,Bender,"Get outta here, freshman! I don't need your help.",1316
14580,Robot 1-X,Our owners asked me to assist you.,1316
14581,Bender,Yeah? Well assist this!,1316
14582,Bender,"When I screamed ""help"" I didn't mean you!",1316
14583,Robot 1-X,"I apologise. However, I was able to do your job before I saved your life.",1316
14584,[Scene,Planet Express,1317
14585,Bender,Don't mind me. I'm just saving you the trouble of throwing me away.,1317
14586,Amy,"Spleesh! Mell out, Bender. Come watch some TV.",1317
14587,Bender,I can't. I'm stuck in the can.,1317
14588,Leela,"Well, ask Robot 1-X to pull you out.",1317
14589,Bender,Never!,1317
14590,Leela,Why can't you accept his help?,1317
14591,Bender,I hate him.,1317
14592,Leela,But he's just a tool to make your life easier. Like a socket wrench or a burglar's kit.,1317
14593,Bender,I can't ask for his help because--,1317
14594,Farnsworth,Yes?,1317
14595,Bender,I'm scared of him.,1317
14596,Leela,"Oh, sorry.",1317
14597,Farnsworth,Well then there's only one solution,1317
14598,Bender,"An upgrade? But I thought we all agreed I was perfect! Fry, didn't we agree I was perfect?",1317
14599,Fry,"Oh, yeah, no, you're pretty perfect.",1317
14600,Bender,"Pretty perfect? So, you do think I need an upgrade?",1317
14601,Farnsworth,"Yes! For God's sakes, yes!",1317
14602,Bender,Fine. I'll be back in a few days.,1317
14603,Roberto,"Man, I hate those new 1-X robots. I'd like to stab 'em! Give 'em some of these!",1318
14604,Bender,"Yeah! Right on, nutcake!",1318
14605,Roberto,Parole officer says I gotta upgrade or he won't give me back my stabbing knife. But it's no big. I hate those 1-X so much I know it won't affect me.  I love those magnificent 1-X robots! The 1-X robots are my friends.,1318
14606,Bender,W-W-Wait! What happened to your enthusiasm for stabbing them?,1318
14607,Roberto,"I'm past that. Later, blood!",1318
14608,Bender,It's like he's not him anymore.  I changed my mind!,1318
14609,Bender,"I did it! I escaped! But to what kind of a life?  Oh, jeez!",1319
14610,Bender,"Curse you, merciful Poseidon!",1320
14611,Bender,"Boy, what is the deal with the ocean? A tropical island, huh? Well, I've washed up on worse places. OK, first up, I'm gonna need to build a shelter.  There. Well, I guess I'll go out for a while.",1321
14612,Bender,Damn. One rock short of rescue!,1321
14613,Bender,"Oop! Low on power.  Oh, no! Guess I'll do what I always do when I run out of booze.",1322
14614,Bender,"Don't panic, I've got these yams. I'll just make some yam schnapps.",1323
14615,Bender,"Hey, I should be mad at you! Now turn around.",1323
14616,Bender,Beer!  Ow!,1324
14617,Bender,Who ... is ... it?  Ow!,1324
14618,Bender,Who are you and why should I care?,1324
14619,Cartridge Unit,"To live a simpler existence, free of technology.",1324
14620,Bender,A working cartridge unit? Wow! You guys went obsolete years ago!,1324
14621,Cartridge Unit,Your mother.,1324
14622,Lisa,"What Cartridge Unit means is the very things that make us obsolete also make us unique. I, for example, need to keep refilling my waterwheel or I'll power down forever.  Anyway, we like it here.",1324
14623,Bender,Like you have a choice.  So what's your problem?,1324
14624,Sinclair,Not enough... uh--,1324
14625,Bender,Memory?,1324
14626,Sinclair,"Oh, great. Now I remember that word but I forgot my wife's face.",1324
14627,Lisa,"If you'd like, you're welcome to join our society.",1324
14628,Bender,"Look, no offence, but I need technology. Especially email and snowmobiles. And television! Without television how will I know what's buzz-worthy?",1324
14629,Sinclair,Why would you wanna watch TV when you can watch a snail crawl for hours on end?,1324
14630,Bender,That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.,1324
14631,Bender,"Oh, man! He's never gonna make it over that next pebble! Wait, wait! Oh, my God! He made it!",1324
14632,Lisa,Yeah!,1324
14633,Sinclair,Way to go!,1324
14634,Bender,"That was the greatest thing ever! Let's party!  Yeah, baby! C'mon!",1324
14635,Lisa,Where did you get that CD?,1324
14636,Bender,"It's one of my ten desert island discs. I never really thought I'd get to use them. But look at me now. Ooh, yeah, baby! Do that thang!",1324
14637,Lisa,CDs are unnatural. Why don't you just listen to the ocean?,1324
14638,Bender,"Which ocean? That ocean?  Take that, Beethoven, you deaf bastard!",1324
14639,Bender,"Bang, bang, bang. You sure got this life thing figured out, cymbal-banging monkey.",1324
14640,Lisa,"Hi, Bender. We know how much you miss technology, so we brought you this washing machine that drifted ashore.",1324
14641,Bender,Ooh! I'm gonna wash my linen so hard the w--  You--!,1324
14642,Lisa,What? I don't understand.,1324
14643,Sinclair,Is he alright?,1324
14644,Bender,Wretched technology has brought me nothing but misery!,1324
14645,Cartridge Unit,"But, Bender, you are technology. You're the most advanced thing on this entire island.",1324
14646,Bender,"Oh, it's true. I am a hideous triumph of form and function.  But not for long!",1324
14647,Bender,"Oh! Ow, that hurt! Oh!",1324
14648,Lisa,The downgrade is complete!,1324
14649,Bender,"Behold, my hand crafted purity. The modern world can bite my splintery, wooden ass!",1324
14650,Lisa,Welcome to your new life of simple tranquillity.,1324
14651,Bender,Pft! Forget that. I say the whole world must learn of our peaceful ways. By force!,1324
14652,Cartridge Unit,What?!,1324
14653,Bender,We're going back to civilisation to wage war on technology!,1324
14654,Cartridge Unit,What?!,1324
14655,Bender,"Row, comrades! Row!",1325
14656,Bender,We'll soon stage an attack on technology worthy of being chronicled in an anthem by Rush!,1325
14657,Lisa,We've been sailing for three weeks. Maybe I should check our position with the periscope.,1325
14658,Bender,"Mirrors reflecting mirrors? Hi-tech sorcery! Sorcery, I say!",1325
14659,Lisa,Did you see anything?,1325
14660,Bender,"Yep, we're there. Prepare to surface!",1325
14661,Bender,"And now, technology shall taste the lash of the hickory switch!",1326
14662,Sinclair,Technology is defeated. Let us return to the island and celebrate by counting rocks!,1327
14663,Cartridge Unit,I'm for that!,1327
14664,Bender,"Whoa, whoa! No one wants to count rocks more than me. But our mission is not complete. Not so long as Robot 1-X torments me with his obvious superiority. Ready the catapult, Sinclair.  Aim for their power lines. They're the devil's veins and electricity is his blood.",1327
14665,Lisa,"Bender, If we don't survive the attack, I want you to know ... I love you.",1327
14666,Bender,"OK, fine. Fire!",1327
14667,Farnsworth,Oh! I'm blind!,1327
14668,Leela,"Professor, we have no power.",1327
14669,Farnsworth,"What do you mean ""no power""? We're living in the future.",1327
14670,Leela,I'd better light some candles.,1327
14671,Bender,"Friends, I've come to free you from your complicated lives. Free you from the ""complicated"" part I mean not the ""lives"" part.",1327
14672,Leela,"Oh, Lord, he's made of wood! What now, Bender?",1327
14673,Bender,"I got a downgrade! I'm a steam-powered wooden robot, just as nature intended. Therefore, I must kill Robot 1-X.",1327
14674,Farnsworth,That's just stupid.,1327
14675,Robot 1-X,Does Mr. Bender wish me to destroy myself?,1327
14676,Bender,I don't need your charity.  Target Robot 1-X and fire!,1327
14677,Farnsworth,"You wanged my ship, you walnut-panelled idiot!",1327
14678,Bender,"Try again, Sinclair. I said ""target Robot 1-X""!",1327
14679,Sinclair,Who's Robot 1-X? Launching.,1327
14680,Zoidberg,"So, I guess everything worked out fine.",1327
14681,Leela,Great! Now we're being crushed.,1327
14682,Amy,"Help us, wooden Bender!",1327
14683,Bender,"Heck! Those guys hate fire! I gotta do something.  What the--? Termites? Well, I don't need legs to save my friends. I'll just use the old extentromatic arms!",1327
14684,Hermes,"Bender, hurry! This fuel's expensive! Also  we're dying!",1327
14685,Bender,"I'm a-comin'  Ow! Lousy primitive body! Oh, why didn't I get that upgrade? I'm an outdated piece of junk!",1327
14686,Robot 1-X,"Sir, might I recommend--",1327
14687,Bender,"You shut up. No, wait! I can use you as a tool to save my friends and I'll still be the hero who everyone says how great he was!",1327
14688,Robot 1-X,How may I help you?,1327
14689,Bender,Save my friends!  And Zoidberg!,1327
14690,Amy,Look! My hair got singed into an even cuter do!,1327
14691,Fry,"Hey, where's Bender?",1327
14692,Bender,"Down here.  I'm so sorry, guys. I never meant to hurt you. Just to destroy everything you ever believed in.",1327
14693,Leela,"Well, at least you saved us from, uh, you. Thank God you finally overcame your incompatibility with Robot 1-X.",1327
14694,Bender,"Oh, yeah, we were totally in sync! I was like ""Save them!"" and he was all ""No problem!"" and then he did it--",1327
14695,Bender,This new technology is great!  I love those magnificent 1-X robots. The 1-X robots are my friends!,1327
14696,Fatbot,"It's like his personality is totally different now! Oh, maybe this upgrade isn't such a good idea.",1327
14697,Bender,I'd like to give Robot 1-X a big smooch on the--  Hey! What's the dealy-o?,1327
14698,Technician,Your upgrade is complete.,1327
14699,Bender,But I destroyed the technology of the world. I ran on the beach and felt the sand between my foot cups.,1327
14700,Technician,Everyone experiences the upgrade differently.,1327
14701,Bender,"Oof. If that stuff wasn't real, how can I be sure anything is real? Is it not possible, nay, probable, that my whole life is just a product of my or someone else's imagination?",1327
14702,Technician,"No, get out.  Next.",1327
14703,Bender,"Well, I guess reality is what you make of it.  Oh, thanks, baby!",1327
14704,Farnsworth,"Oh, Lordy Lou! Help!",1328
14705,Fry,"I know you've rejected me a lot before but, frankly, I wasn't sure we were right for each other either. But now I am. So how 'bout a date tonight?",1328
14706,Leela,"Sorry. I think I, um, I think I left my toaster on.",1328
14707,Farnsworth,Buddha! Zeus! God! One of you guys do something!,1328
14708,Fry,"Come on, Leela, what's the real reason you won't go out with me?",1328
14709,Farnsworth,Help! Satan! You owe me!,1328
14710,Leela,I have sweaty boot rash.,1328
14711,Amy,No spluh! Why do you think I'm sitting over here in the stink-free zone?,1328
14712,Fry,"So, will you go out with me?",1328
14713,Farnsworth,"Good news, everyone. I'm still technically alive. Yes!  You'll have to throw it into the sun itself. For only the thermo-nuclear inferno of the sun has enough energy to ensure its total destruction.",1329
14714,Bender,I can hit it with a shovel.,1329
14715,Farnsworth,That's not good enough.,1329
14716,Bender,This one time I pounded a guy into the ground like a stake with a shovel.,1329
14717,Farnsworth,"Yes, yes.",1329
14718,Zoidberg,"So what's in the box, already?",1329
14719,Farnsworth,No peeking!  I don't know what's in there but I'm sure our minds would be unable to comprehend it.,1329
14720,Hermes,Ow! You hurt my collator!,1329
14721,Farnsworth,I don't care.  Pretty tantalising though!,1329
14722,Fry,"Whatever's in there, it's the only thing I've ever wanted.",1330
14723,Zoidberg,"In my experience, boxes are usually empty. Or maybe with a little cheese stuck to the top. And one time pepperoni!  Give me the box!",1330
14724,Hermes,"Scram, you lousy green snakes!  Here, Leela. Take this and use it to shoot those guys.",1330
14725,Leela,Right. If they try to look in the box.,1330
14726,Hermes,Whatever.,1330
14727,Fry,Let's just forget about the box. The Professor said to stay away.,1331
14728,Bender,"Fry, how can you be so naive? He was joking. Get it?",1331
14729,Fry,No.,1331
14730,Bender,"That's what makes it so funny!  OK, he wasn't joking. Now shut up and follow me.",1331
14731,Fry,Ow! It's hot! The butter in my pocket is melting.,1332
14732,Bender,"We thank you, Bender, for the gift we are about to receive.",1333
14733,Fry,Tangled-up Christmas lights! We can take shifts untangling them.,1333
14734,Bender,And unlabeled booze! Wide-mouth too!,1333
14735,Leela,That oughta keep those dopes occupied.  I can guard the real box in peace now that no one's curious about it.,1333
14736,Leela,"Well, I got through the night and no one looked in the box. Not even me. The person who gave up her whole evening to watch it. A whole evening of TV gone. What a mockery of justice that I can't take even a little tiny peek.  Oh, it's deep. Deeper than a small box should be.",1333
14737,Leela A,Ouch! My lawyer will hear about this!,1333
14738,Fry 1,"Leela, what have you done?",1333
14739,Leela A,"Nothing. What do you mean ""Why was I looking in the box?""",1333
14740,Fry 1,I mean your hair. It's all different-y.,1333
14741,Leela A,Bender? Is that you?,1333
14742,Bender 1,You know it! Large and in charge!,1333
14743,Farnsworth 1,"Leela? Oh, there's a woman for you! Always dyeing her hair instead of not looking in a box.",1333
14744,Leela A,I didn't dye my hair. This is how I always look.,1333
14745,Bender 1,"No, that's how you always look.  This throws my entire perception of reality into question. Clone? Robot? Or long-lost twin? Taking all bets! I also offer video poker.",1333
14746,Fry 1,It's some guy wearing a Leela costume! Get him!,1333
14747,Leela A,Hold it! You have this all wrong. I just fell into the box and then I fell out somehow.,1333
14748,Fry 1,"You shut up, sir!",1333
14749,Farnsworth 1,"No, wait! I've got it. I know what's in the box. Oh, I've been as dumb as Fry.",1333
14750,Fry 1,Am not!,1333
14751,Farnsworth 1,"It contains a parallel universe. And when you create a parallel universe, it's almost always populated by evil twins.",1333
14752,Leela A,"Now, look",1333
14753,Farnsworth 1,"Oh, you'd like us to believe that wouldn't you, Leela? Or should I say Evil-a?",1333
14754,Bender 1,"Oh, this is awful. Somewhere there's a Bender more evil than me. I do my best, damnit!",1333
14755,Farnsworth 1,Leela?  Here.,1333
14756,Leela A,I tell you they're not evil. But don't be confused. They are jerks.,1333
14757,Zoidberg A,Hello!,1333
14758,Leela 1,Hi-yah!,1333
14759,Zoidberg A,Ow!,1333
14760,Leela 1,Come out of your universe with your hands up!,1333
14761,Fry A,"Oh, wow! It's like that drug trip I saw in that movie when I was on that drug trip.",1333
14762,Farnsworth A,Astonishing! I must have created a parallel universe.,1333
14763,Farnsworth 1,Baldercrap! I created your universe. All you created was my fist parallel to your face.,1333
14764,Farnsworth A,Ow.,1333
14765,Leela A,"Look, it doesn't matter who created what. The important thing is-- Yah!",1333
14766,Leela 1,"We're exactly the same. I know all her moves. Therefore, I've got the upper hand.",1333
14767,Farnsworth 1,"Now, now. Perfectly symmetrical violence never solved anything.",1333
14768,Farnsworth A,"Let's recap what's happened so far.  As you can see, I accidentally created a box containing your universe.",1334
14769,Farnsworth 1,"While I, in a simultaneous blunder, created a box containing your universe.",1334
14770,Leela A,"This is getting confusing. Why don't we call our universe ""Universe A"" and this universe ""Universe B""?",1334
14771,Bender 1,Hey! Why can't we be Universe A?,1334
14772,Fry 1,Yeah!,1334
14773,Amy 1,Yeah!,1334
14774,Farnsworth 1,We want A!,1334
14775,Zoidberg 1,It's the best letter!,1334
14776,Fry A,"We called it first. Besides, this place kinda feels like a ""B"", y'know?",1334
14777,Leela 1,"Alright, you can be crummy Universe A and we'll be Universe 1.",1334
14778,Fry 1,"Or ""The Mongooses"". That's a cool team name. The Fighting Mongooses!",1334
14779,Farnsworth A,"Wait a second. If everyone is identical, why did our Leela look into the box and your Leela didn't?",1334
14780,Leela 1,"Well, to be honest, I tossed a coin. It came up tails so I didn't look.",1334
14781,Leela A,"That's weird. Mine came up heads, so I did.",1334
14782,Farnsworth A,"Interesting. Apparently, the key difference between our universes is that coin flips have opposite outcomes.",1334
14783,Bender A,That explains fruity here!  I tossed a coin to pick my finish. Fog hat grey!,1334
14784,Bender 1,Hey! Bite my glorious golden ass!,1334
14785,Farnsworth A,You people and your slight differences disgust me. I'm going home. Where's that blue box with our universe in it?,1334
14786,Farnsworth 1,"Oh, you'd like to get back to your evil universe, wouldn't you? And destroy your box with our universe inside it.",1334
14787,Farnsworth A,Nonsense! I would never do such a thing unless you were already having been going to do that!,1334
14788,Farnsworth 1,Wha?,1334
14789,Farnsworth A,You heard me!,1334
14790,Farnsworth 1,"In any case, I've hidden the box and it will remain hidden until I'm convinced you're not evil.  Everyone, keep an eye on your evil counterpart.",1334
14791,Farnsworth A,And you all do the same!,1334
14792,Leela 1,"Um, can Fry and I watch our parallel selves together? We have plans tonight.",1334
14793,Leela A,You guys are dating?!,1334
14794,Fry 1,"Oh, no, no. We're married.",1334
14795,Bender A,"I've got my eye on you, boy!",1335
14796,Bender 1,"Don't even think about it, lunch-pail! You'd be dead before you hit the ground.",1335
14797,Bender A,Good point. Whattya say we just hit a strip joint?,1335
14798,Bender 1,"I was waitin' for one of us to say that!  Bender A, you're a prince among robots. Can you forgive me for distrusting you?",1335
14799,Bender A,Aw! I can't stay mad at what is essentially me. I love me!,1335
14800,Amy 1,This is so great! I always wanted an imaginary friend!,1336
14801,Amy A,"I'm not imaginary, I'm parallel. We're exactly the same, right down to the--  Splech! Is that pink nail polish?",1336
14802,Amy 1,"Is that not pink nail polish? The Professor's right, you are evil. And shallow.",1336
14803,Amy A,I am not evil!,1336
14804,Leela A,"So, Fry, Leela, how'd you two get together?",1337
14805,Fry 1,Funny story. I asked Leela out a million times but she just kept rejecting me.,1337
14806,Leela 1,"I'd make up stuff like ""I have sweaty boot rash"" or ""I have to meet the President""!",1337
14807,Fry 1,"Oh, man, you never heard such excuses! But, like a dope, I believed her. Looking back on it now, it's kinda funny.",1337
14808,Fry A,"It sure is. Right, Leela? Funny. Ha ha ha ha!",1337
14809,Leela 1,"Then one night, when Fry asked me out, the only excuse I could think of involved ghosts. I knew he wouldn't buy it, so I did what I always do in those situations.",1337
14810,Leela A,"Oh, Lord...",1337
14811,Leela 1,I flipped a coin. It came up heads and we went out.,1337
14812,Fry A,You mean you flipped a coin too? And it was tails? So that's why you said you had to meet that ghost.,1337
14813,Leela 1,"You really missed out on something, Leela. That date was magical.",1337
14814,Fry 1,"One year later, I gave Leela a diamond scrunchie and we were married.",1337
14815,Leela A,Ooh!,1337
14816,Fry A,"One year later, I got beat up at a Neil Diamond concert by a guy named Scrunchie!",1337
14817,Farnsworth 1,"Well, that was pointless.",1338
14818,Farnsworth A,"Say, I hope you won't think it ""evil"" of me to ask how you got that stylish head wound.",1338
14819,Farnsworth 1,"Oh, this old thing? I was experimenting to see if I could remove my own brain.",1338
14820,Farnsworth A,"Of course! I had the same idea. I flipped a coin to decide if I should proceed. But it came up tails, so I didn't. How'd it go?",1338
14821,Farnsworth 1,Well getting the brain out was the easy part. The hard part was getting the brain out!,1338
14822,Farnsworth A,"Oh, you!",1338
14823,Zoidberg 1,"So, tell me about yourself.",1339
14824,Zoidberg A,"Well, don't look into it, but I'm a respected internal medicine doctor. Ooh! A can!",1339
14825,Zoidberg 1,"As for me, I design mansions, then live in them.  I'm lying! I'm an appalling failure!",1339
14826,Zoidberg A,"Me too! A big, fat one!",1339
14827,Zoidberg 1,"And those co-workers, always looking down on us Zoidbergs. What are they, from Nob Hill?",1339
14828,Zoidberg A,"They're all like ""Stop spraying me with ink, Zoidberg!"" ""Put on pants, Zoidberg!"" ""Don't touch our fancy box, Zoidberg!""",1339
14829,Zoidberg 1,"Oh, that box! Too good for us, is it?",1339
14830,Zoidberg A,"Bah! Someday they'll watch from down in the gutter, they will, as King Zoidberg caresses their fancy box.",1339
14831,Zoidberg 1,"You know, maybe a certain blue lobster saw where Professor hid the box.",1339
14832,Farnsworth 1,"Good news, everyones!",1340
14833,Farnsworth A,"After carefully reading the scriptures, we've concluded that none of us are evil.",1340
14834,Farnsworth 1,"Yes, the Bible is the real good news. Anyhow, you're all free to go back to your own universe.",1340
14835,Hermes 1,What's goin' on here? Why aren't you all out destroying the Professor's box?,1340
14836,Leela 1,"Hermes, aren't you curious about the fact that there's two of everybody?",1340
14837,Hermes 1,"No. Now like my granny used to say back in her tarpaper shack on Montego Bay, ""If you want a box hurled into the sun, you got to do it yourself.""",1340
14838,Farnsworth 1,Your granny can go to hell! I've hidden the box so no one can destroy the home universe of my handsome friend here.,1340
14839,Farnsworth A,"Oh, go on! Wait a second. If your Hermes was about to destroy the box containing our universe...",1340
14840,Farnsworth 1,Then your Hermes...,1340
14841,Farnsworth A,"Oh, my!",1340
14842,Narrator,And sure enough...,1341
14843,Hermes,"Like Granny said, ""If you want a box hurled into the sun, you got to do it yourself."" God rest her zombie bones.",1341
14844,Leela A,So we go back through the box and stop Hermes?,1342
14845,Farnsworth A,Right. Good thing Professor B there hid it in the coelacanth tank. No one but a crazy lobster would look there!,1342
14846,Farnsworth 1,It's gone!,1342
14847,Zoidberg A,"All hail Zoidberg, the king with the box!  Now it's my turn, maybe?",1342
14848,Zoidberg 1,The box says no.,1342
14849,Narrator,"Meanwhile in Universe A, Hermes A heads towards the sun ... A.",1343
14850,Hermes,Item one,1343
14851,Hermes 1,"If I know parallel Hermes, he's at the sun by now.",1344
14852,Bender 1,Our universe is doomed!,1344
14853,Bender 1 and Bender A,Doooooooomed!,1344
14854,Farnsworth 1,"Now don't give up yet, you cry babies. The box is gone but we still have one preposterously slim hope.",1344
14855,Amy A,Is it a kind of hairspray?,1344
14856,Farnsworth A,No! We must attempt to make another box containing our universe. Doy!,1344
14857,Fry 1,Well? Is that your universe in there?,1344
14858,Fry A,Nope. Too cold.,1344
14859,Farnsworth A,I'll put this one aside for later.,1344
14860,Hermes 1,"Oh, man, it's hopeless! We'll never find your universe in time. Plus, this box is stuck on my fat head.",1344
14861,Farnsworth 1,"Yes, it's the apocalypse alright. I always thought I'd have a hand in it.",1344
14862,Bender 1,"I'm not sad because I finally found someone as great as me. It's like I always say, ""Make new friends and keep the old. One is silver--""",1344
14863,Bender A,"""And the other's gold.""",1344
14864,Zoidberg 1,Why with the long faces?,1344
14865,Leela 1,The idiots have the box!,1344
14866,Zoidberg A,I think she means you.,1344
14867,Farnsworth 1,Grab them!,1344
14868,Zoidberg 1,You coward! Wait for me!,1344
14869,Amy,Blug! Which one did they go into?,1344
14870,Farnsworth A,"Oh, let's all ask each other! That'll solve this problem!",1344
14871,Farnsworth 1,"We'll each have to search a universe. Everyone, grab a length of wire first so you can find your way back.",1344
14872,Amy 1,Hello? Did you see two smelly lobsters?,1345
14873,Hermes 25,We didn't see anything ...  ... ever!,1345
14874,Fry,"Yo! Uh, did two shellfish in scrubs go by?",1346
14875,Fry 1729,"Hell, no!",1346
14876,Leela 1729,Shut up!,1346
14877,Bender 1729,"Beat it, jerk!",1346
14878,Leela A,"Uh, have you robot versions of you guys seen any extra Zoidbergs around here?",1347
14879,Fry 31,Negative. Will you go out with me?,1347
14880,Leela A,"Uh, access denied.",1347
14881,Bender 1,"Hey, pal, look what I snagged from the Leprechaun Universe!",1348
14882,Bender,"Yeah, Leprechaun Universe is fine ... if you haven't seen Pirate Universe!",1348
14883,Bender 1,Faith and begorra!,1348
14884,Farnsworth XVII,Quae?,1348
14885,Zoidberg A,Quick! Into another box!,1349
14886,Zoidberg 1,"There aren't any in this universe, there aren't. Hey, you, what with the no boxes?",1349
14887,Farnsworth 420,"Baby, they're somewhere. Everything's like somewhere! Place is kinda au naturel right now.",1349
14888,Farnsworth 1,There they are!,1349
14889,Farnsworth A,Gotcha!,1349
14890,Farnsworth 420,Dig it! All of you fitting in this boxed is like seriously freaked up!,1349

14901,Amy 1,Later!,1352
14902,Fry,"There but for the flip of a coin go we. So, um, Leela? Seeing how the universe wasn't destroyed, you wanna catch an ape fight? You know, together?",1352
14903,Leela,"Well, I guess you deserve one more flip.",1352
14904,Fry,"So, heads or tails?",1352
14905,Leela,"Y'know, let's just say it's heads.",1352
14906,Farnsworth,Ready?,1352
14907,Farnsworth,"and  One, two, three, pull!",1352
14908,Farnsworth,There. That space-time eversion has given us their box and vice versa.,1352
14909,Leela,"So, what you think you just explained to us is that--",1352
14910,Farnsworth,Correct! This box contains our own universe.,1352
14911,Hermes,Sweet honey bee of infinity!,1352
14912,Leela,Bender! Quit destroying the universe!,1352
14913,Bender,But--,1352

14916,Zapp,Mmm!,1354
14917,Nixon,"My fellow Earthicans, after meeting with top voodoo economists, I have decided to refund our silk surplus to you, the taxpayers. That's right! I've sent you each 300 buckaroos in the form of a Tricky Dick Fun Bill. Knock yourselves out!",1354
14918,Zoidberg,Money!,1354
14919,Amy,I'm slightly richer!,1354
14920,Bender,"What to do, what to do? One $300 hookerbot or 300 $1 hookerbots?",1354
14921,Leela,I'm going to swim with a whale. They're the gentle giants of the deep.,1354
14922,Farnsworth,I'm well aware of that.,1354
14923,Scruffy,Scruffy's gonna get himself one of them $300 haircuts. This one's lost its pizzazz!,1354

14925,Nixon,"Hey, cut it out! Go away! Get away!",1354

14930,Leela,No.,1354
14931,Zapp,"Oh, yes, you are! I'm hereby inviting you and your oddball co-workers to a special reception to display the national silk surplus. I believe you know the heroic space stallion who captured it. Show them my medal, Kif.",1354
14932,Kif,He rented it with his tax refund.,1354
14933,Zapp,"So, Leela, will you have the pleasure?",1354

14942,Amy,Shut up!  Ow!,1355
14943,Farnsworth,"Uh, ma'am, it has become too much of a chore for me to clean out my wrinkles each day. Is it true that stem cells may fight the aging process?",1356

14945,Farnsworth,"One pound of stem cells, please.",1356
14946,Geneworks Woman,"Of course, any age-reversing effects will be purely temporary.",1356
14947,Bender,"Say, buddy, why's this Grand Cigar so pricey?",1357
14948,Clerk,"Well, as you can see, its wrapper is a piece of the original US Constitution. It was hand-rolled by Queen Elizabeth during her wild years and was buried with George Burns until graverobbing space mushrooms-- Uh, well you know the rest.",1357
14949,Bender,Give you 300 bucks for it.,1357
14950,Clerk,No can do.,1357
14951,Bender,"Oh, alright, I'll just take these $300 burglars tools then.",1357

14954,Dwight,"Hey, Pops! Did that tax rebate come?",1358

14956,Dwight,"But, Pops, I don't wanna have fun. I wanna be like you; boring but prudently invested.",1358
14957,Hermes,Babylon's bells! I tallied almost 300 bananas on this entertainment product. Now you put 'em on and have fun.,1358
14958,Dwight,I don't wanna!,1358

14969,Leela,Then why'd you become a whale biologist?,1361

15314,Fry,I am trying. I've been taking lessons.,1388
15315,Bender,"Lessons? Oh, that's rich! Isn't it time you gave up all hope of ever improving yourself in any way?",1388
15316,Fry,"I know I should but I just can't. Remember when I had those stomach worms that made me smart? I could play the holophonor and it made Leela like me.  Hey, Bender, as long as you know, I have a holophonor recital Tuesday. I'd really like to have somebody there. Please?",1388
15317,Bender,"Fine, I'll go already. Y'know, sometimes I wish your real parents were still alive. Not often, though.",1388
15318,Bender,Whoa! Hey!,1389
15319,Fry,"Uh, hello, Mrs. Mellonger.",1390
15320,Mrs. Mellonger,"Hello, Philip.  And you must be Mr. Bender. Philip's told me so much about you. Is it true that you're a robot?",1390
15321,Bender,"I prefer the term ""love machine"".",1390
15322,Bender,Wow! Your kid is great. How hard did you say you had to hit him?,1390
15323,Mother,Fairly hard.,1390
15324,Fry,The Grumpy Snail.  Sorry!,1390
15325,Boy,It's too grumpy!,1390
15326,Fry,Ow! No! Quit it! Stop!,1390
15327,Mrs. Mellonger,"Mr. Bender, I simply cannot teach your child.",1390
15328,Bender,"Then good day, madam!  We hope to see you soon for tea.",1390
15329,Fry,It's hopeless! I can hear all this great music in my head but my stupid hands can't keep up.,1391
15330,Bender,Aww. You know what always cheers me up? Laughing at other people's misfortunes.,1391
15331,Leela,"Hey, guys. You missed a great delivery to Space Earth. Where you been all afternoon?",1391
15332,Fry,"At, uh, uh, a concert.",1391
15333,Leela,Ooh! Was it jazz noodling? My ex-boyfriend Sean played the sax. I used to listen for hours while he sat naked on my couch and improvised.,1391
15334,Bender,"So musicians really Rodger your Hammerstein, huh?",1391
15335,Leela,"Yeah, it's weird; Sean was uneducated, unambitious. He was pastey and hunched--",1391
15336,Fry,Pretty boy.,1391
15337,Leela,"But when he played I could sense this incredible, beautiful creative soul. Then one day I found someone else's couch fibres on his butt.  I couldn't believe it. I was really...",1391
15338,Fry,That could be my beautiful soul sitting naked on her couch if I could just learn to play this stupid thing.,1391
15339,Bender,"Oh, but you can. Though you may have to metaphorically make a ""deal with the devil"". And by ""devil"" I mean ""Robot Devil"". And by ""metaphorically"" I mean ""get your coat"".",1391
15340,Robot Devil,"You hit a sour note about 200 years back, Doug!  Ah, Bender, Fry. You've come back for more eternal damnation.",1392
15341,Bender,"No, this isn't a religious visit. Fry just wants holophonor lessons.",1392
15342,Fry,Yep. I need to get really good without practising.,1392
15343,Robot Devil,"Hell is full of ten-year-olds who wanted exactly the same thing. Trouble is, you have what my old music teacher, Mrs. Mellonger, calls ""stupid fingers"".  Now wouldn't it be nice if you had a pair of robot hands to replace them?",1392
15344,Fry,"Sure would.  Oh, well. Goodbye.",1392
15345,Bender,"Fry, you smelly idiot, I think he's willing to make some kind of deal with the devil with you.",1392
15346,Fry,"He-He-He is?  Great! Wait, what's the catch?",1392
15347,Robot Devil,"No catch. I'll merely pick a robot at random from somewhere in the universe, probably one you've never even met, and then I'll remove his hands and switch them for yours.  It's just the sort of guy I am. What do you say?",1392
15348,Fry,I don't know. It doesn't seem entirely moral to--,1392
15349,Bender,"Fry, if you don't take this offer right now I will lose all respect for you and punch you.",1392
15350,Fry,"Well, alright. You sure I probably won't know him?",1392
15351,Robot Devil,Definitely probably not.  Just sign this contract.,1392
15352,Bender,Wow!,1392
15353,Robot Devil,And here we go!,1392
15354,Bender,I got a hundred bucks on Rectal-Exambot!,1392
15355,Fry,Robot Devil? I get your hands? Zam!,1392
15356,Robot Devil,"Oh, what an appallingly ironic outcome.",1392
15357,Bender,"It's not ironic, it's just coincidental. Now fork over those lady-fingers, Cookie!",1392
15358,Robot Devil,"Y'know, I only put my name on there as a show of good faith for the other robots.",1392
15359,Fry,Stop being such a baby and chop my hands off.,1392
15360,Robot Devil,"Oh, very well.",1392
15361,Fry,How'd you do that?,1392
15362,Robot Devil,They're very good hands.,1392
15363,Fry,At last! At last I have the power to make Leela love me.,1392
15364,Robot Devil,"Oh, sorry. That'll wear off in a couple of days.",1392
15365,Fry,"Check it out, everyone. I'm back from hell and I've got the Robot Devil's hands.",1393
15366,Amy,Neat! Let's see a trick.,1393
15367,Fry,Alrighty!,1393
15368,Scruffy,Somebody called the Robot Devil's here to see somebody called Fry.,1393
15369,Fry,Uh-oh.,1393
15370,Bender,Where'd I go just now?,1393
15371,Robot Devil,"Hello, Fry.  Give me back my hands! These things are always touching me in places.",1394
15372,Fry,"Yeah, they get around! But I'm afraid we had a deal.",1394
15373,Robot Devil,Looks like I wasted a bus trip.,1394

15384,Fry,"Thank you, sir. That's exactly what I was going for.",1395
15385,Hedonismbot,You were the sole diversion in what has been a pale and unamusing season. And so I would fain commission you write an opera.,1395
15386,Fry,But I've never written an opera.,1395
15387,Hedonismbot,"And I've never heard one. Still, if you can keep me amused through the overture I shall consider it a smashing success.",1395
15388,Fry,"But I wouldn't even know what to write about. Unless...  OK, I'll do it. If I can make it about Leela.",1395

15391,Leela,Is it part of the opera?,1396
15392,Fry,Leela!  You shouldn't be listening. I don't want you to hear it till it's done.,1396
15393,Leela,But it's so beautiful.,1396
15394,Fry,So's a peacock but you don't eat it until it's cooked. This has to be perfect. I want you to hear exactly what I hear when I think about you.,1396
15395,Leela,"Oh, Fry. All this time you've had this incredible gift and I never knew. I've been a fool. A fully-justified, prudent fool.  They're so cold.",1396

15403,Robot Devil,Really? There's nothing you want?,1397

15406,Bender,Grabby and Squeezy? Never! I love these guys!,1397
15407,Robot Devil,Well is there anything else you would part with?,1397
15408,Bender,No. Nothing. Ain't gonna happen.,1397
15409,Bender,Yes! With this built-in stadium airhorn I can really annoy people. And all it cost me was my crotch-plate.,1397
15410,Robot Devil,"You certainly are a shrewd businessman, Bender.  Now find someone and give 'em a good blast!",1397
15411,Bender,Yeah! That'll teach the first person I see a lesson.,1397

15584,Leela,It feels great to be back at the wheel after two long years.,1405
15585,Fry,That's not the wheel.,1405
15586,Leela,It's nice out.,1405
15587,Fry,"""You must be at least this naked""? How much nakeder could you be?",1405
15588,Zoidberg,Watch and learn.,1405
15589,Bender,"You know, it's funny.",1405
15590,Fry,What?,1405
15591,Bender,Your weiner!,1405
15592,Farnsworth,"Well, I'm going in the water to prune up a bit before I strut. Who's with me?",1405
15593,Amy,I'm in!,1405
15594,Leela,I'm in.,1405
15595,Bender,"Yeah, I'll go.",1405
15596,Fry,You guys go ahead. I gotta find the bartender and deliver this box of barstool softener.,1405
15597,Fry,"Here's your package, sir.",1406
15598,Bartender,Why are you talking to my penis?,1406
15599,Fry,"Oh, sorry. Sign here.",1406
15600,Bartender,Mind if I use your pen?,1406
15601,Fry,"Well, that's not a...",1406
15602,Fry,And initial here.,1406
15603,Fry,Thank you for using Planet Express.,1406
15604,Leela,"Hey, Fry, I didn't know you had a tattoo of Bender on your ass.",1406
15605,Fry,Me neither.,1406
15606,Bender,You got a tattoo of me? Neat. It's like looking in a smelly mirror.,1406
15607,Farnsworth,So he's got a little ink. Big whoop.,1406
15608,Bender,"Sweet photons. I don't know if you're waves or particles, but you go down smooth.",1406
15609,Nudar,"Sir, would you care to sign our petition?",1406
15610,Bender,"I support and oppose many things, but not strongly enough to pick up a pen.",1406
15611,Nudar,That's just what the guys who oppose the things you support want you to do.,1406
15612,Bender,Really? Down with those guys!,1406
15613,Fleb,And we'll need your e-mail address.,1406
15614,Bender,"Hmm, they say you shouldn't give out your e-mail address.",1406
15615,Nudar,Right. That's just what those same guys say.,1406
15616,Bender,Them again?,1406
15617,Leela,I don't quite understand what this petition's about.,1406
15618,Leela,"You won't send me any spam, will you?",1406
15619,Nudar,"Oh, no, no, no, no. Asterisk.",1406
15620,Leela's Wrist Thingy,You've got spam.,1406
15621,Leela,"Spam, spam, junk.",1406
15622,Amy,"Spam. Spam. ""Hi. How are you?"" Oh, that must be from Kiffy.",1406
15623,Amy's computer,"Hi, how are you? Low, low prices on erectile dysfunction remedies, sleeping pills, old-person drugs, and antidepressants.",1406
15624,Amy,"Antidepressants? Well, I certainly don't want to get depressed.",1406
15625,Amy's computer,Please enter credit card number.,1406
15626,Amy,Is cash okay?,1406
15627,Bender,Porn. Porn. Free porn. Get rich watching porn? I find that rather hard to believe.,1406
15628,Bender,"Warning, perform virus scan? I'm waiting for porn over here.",1406
15629,Bender,"Oh, yeah, come on, baby.",1406
15630,Zoidberg,"Friends, friends! His Majesty Prince Adisaraki O. Zoidberg of Nigeria died.",1406
15631,Amy,When will those antidepressants get here?,1406
15632,Zoidberg,"Wait, there's more. Once I wire some good-faith money to an overseas bank account, I'll inherit his kingdom, his canoe, and his plump young wife.",1406
15633,Hermes,You dumb stumps. Don't you realize you're being scammed?,1406
15634,Zoidberg,"That is low, Hermes. Just because you don't have a body, you don't want anyone else to be prince of Nigeria. Well, try and stop me from wiring that money.",1406
15635,Farnsworth,"What's going on here? According to my illegal key logging software, you've all been giving out personal information over the Internet. If Hermes were here, he'd fire you all.Hermes",1406
15636,Farnsworth,"Quiet, you. In his absence, I'm calling a mandatory company security seminar. To the mandatorium!",1406
15637,Farnsworth,"Now, it's not hard to spot a phoney Internet come-on. ""Get rich quick x7 q""? Phoney. ""Lose weight with space parasites""? Phoney. What's this? I've won the Spanish National Lottery?",1406
15638,Leela,"No, it's a scam!",1406
15639,Farnsworth,"My goodness, I'm rich! And to think I didn't even know I had a ticket. I just need to wire some collateral to collect the winnings.",1406
15640,Hermes,"Professor, stop! You're giving away personal information!",1406
15641,Farnsworth,I can afford to give away anything I want. I've won the Spanish National Lottery.,1406
15642,Amy,"No, don't!",1406
15643,Leela,It's a scam!,1406
15644,Hermes,Why won't anybody listen to me?!?,1406
15645,Farnsworth,And my mother's maiden name and her bank account numbers and ... There! I'm rich. Rich. Rich!,1406
15646,Farnsworth,"That must be my $400 now. Hello. Or should I say, '""Buenos dias""?",1406
15647,Nudar,Hi. We own your company now.,1406
15648,Farnsworth,Hwhaa?,1406
15649,Bender,"Welcome, boss.",1406
15650,Nudar,Guess I was wrong. There was a robot stupid enough to download the obedience virus.,1406
15651,Bender,"I sure was. Make a hole, chumps.  Presenting our new masters!",1406
15652,Bender,"Where shall I put these auto-dialers, kind master?",1406
15653,Nudar,Between the password crank and the spamjaculator. Come on! We've got a whole planet to scam. And bring me some more Gummi Fungus!,1406
15654,Leela,We don't have to stand here and take abuse from a gross nerd.,1406
15655,Amy,Yeah!,1406
15656,Fry,Yeah!,1406
15657,Leela,Hi-yah!,1406
15658,Nudar,"Now get back to work, you turkeys. Planet Express is still in business. We've got crap loads of quote-unquote merchandise to deliver.",1406
15659,Fleb,"Ship them out, Your Highness.",1406
15660,Zoidberg,"Finally, some respect.",1406
15661,Amy,I feel a little better.,1406
15662,Bender,"Those marvellous scammers sure scammed us, huh?",1407
15663,Leela,How can you just sit there kissing the aliens' butt flaps? Don't you realize you are totally under their control?,1407
15664,Bender,"Of course I realize it. Does that mean I can't enjoy it? Boy, were we suckers.",1407
15665,Lars,"Greetings, earthlings.",1407
15666,Fry,"Oh, hooray. It's handsome Lars and his fabulous jars.",1407
15667,Lars,"Hello, everyone who isn't Leela. And a special hello to everyone else.",1407
15668,Hermes,Shut your lockers and get to class. How's my body doing?,1407
15669,Lars,"Oh, I'm afraid it's behind schedule. The museum got tricked into giving all its funding to something called the Scamming Sciences Institute.",1407
15670,Bender,It's a fake place.,1407
15671,Hermes,No! That body's the cornerstone of my marriage. What's LaBarbara going to do?,1407
15672,Amy,Spluh! She's going to go back to her first husband.,1407
15673,Zoidberg,Barbados Slim? I love that guy.,1407
15674,Hermes,Everybody loves Slim.,1407
15675,Hermes,He's the only man to ever win Olympic gold medals in both limbo and sex.,1407
15676,Lars,"Well, maybe I should get going.",1407
15677,Fry,"Yes, I'll show you out.",1407
15678,Amy,"No, Leela will show him out.",1407
15679,Leela,"No, Leela will show you out. Me. Leela.",1407
15680,Lars,"So your friend, Fry, seems nice. Are you and he dati--?",1408
15681,Leela,Nope.,1408
15682,Lars,"Good, because I was maybe thinking of asking you out for dinner.",1408
15683,Leela,"Ohhhh. I'll start maybe thinking about saying ""Sure, when?""",1408
15684,Lars,Let me maybe give it some thought.,1408
15685,Lars,Tomorrow at 8,1408
15686,Leela,Okay.,1408
15687,Fry,It's not fair. I've loved Leela since the day I came to the future. Did I show you the macaroni valentine I made for her?,1408
15688,Amy,Yes.,1408
15689,Fry,"Look at it again. I know she thinks I'm immature, but someday I won't be. And deep down in my heart, I know we'll end up together. It's all there in the macaroni.",1408
15690,Leela,Lars asked me out!,1408
15691,Bender,"What are you doing, wonderful masters?",1409
15692,Fleb,Sprunjing for information.,1409
15693,Nudar,"Oh! There's something here. I can sprunje it. Robot, tear it open!",1409
15694,Bender,"Goody, goody, goody, goody!",1409
15695,Zoidberg,What's that thing on your neck?,1409
15696,Nudar,"Checking out my sprunjer, huh?",1409
15697,Zoidberg,I guess. What does it do?,1409
15698,Nudar,It's a special sense organ our species possesses. It engorges in the presence of...  Information.,1409
15699,Zoidberg,Lucky you. All I have is a gland that gives off foul odors when I'm bored.,1409
15700,Bender,"Hey, look, a safe!",1409
15701,Farnsworth,That's my safe. I call keep-offsies.,1409
15702,Nudar,No callsies! Open it!,1409
15703,Fleb,"It's a gold mine. Tax forms, Social Security cards. Combination hair, blood and stool samples!",1409
15704,Fry,I don't get it. How can you say Lars is more mature than me?,1409
15705,Leela,"Well, for one thing, his chequebook doesn't have the Hulk on it.",1409
15706,Nudar,Who are you?,1409
15707,Fry,Philip J. Fry.,1409
15708,Fleb,"Social Security Number 03280810? Stool type, P-negative?",1409
15709,Fry,That's right.,1409
15710,Nudar,I've never detected so much information before. I think it may be a Level 87 code.,1409
15711,Schumlp,"Level 87? Can it be? I thought it was only a legend, but the sprunjer never lies.",1409
15712,Nudar,It's in his pants!,1409
15713,Fry,What the hell are you talking about?,1409
15714,Nudar,"Faster, faster!",1410
15715,Farnsworth,I'm sciencing as fast as I can.,1410
15716,Bender,"What do you say, folks? Hot or not?",1410
15717,Nudar,"You, boogerbot, read the code or I'll shoot this guy.",1410
15718,Bender,Who the hell is he?,1410
15719,Scruffy,"I'm Scruffy, the janitor.",1410
15720,Bender,"Hang on, Scruffy! Zero, zero, one, one, zero, zero, zero, one, zero, zero, one, zero, zero, one, one, one, one, zero, one, zero, zero, zero, zero, one, one, zero, one, one, zero, one, one, one, zero, zero, one, one.",1410
15721,"""God""",Huh?,1410
15722,Fleb,A time sphere.,1410
15723,Nudar,"Naked brothers, we have sprunjed upon the universal machine language time code. The key to time travel!",1410
15724,Leela,What's the secret of time travel doing on Fry's ass?,1410
15725,Fry,It was bound to be somewhere.,1410
15726,Schlump,Beyond this shimmering portal lie all the glories of history.,1410
15727,Nudar,And we can steal them! We just go to the past and take stuff with our superior weapons!,1410
15728,Nibbler,"Stop, you fools!",1410
15729,Amy,What's going on?,1410
15730,Farnsworth,What is happening?,1410
15731,Leela,"Nibbler, you... You can talk?",1410
15732,Nibbler,"I can do more than talk. I can pontificate. You must not use the code of codes. With each and every use, you risk tearing the universe asunder.",1410
15733,Schlump,The poodle-monkey may be right. The legend warns that the code is powerful and dangerous.,1410
15734,Nudar,"My God. We'd better use it only three or four times. Six, max.",1410
15735,Nibbler,But even a single use could shatter the universe!,1410
15736,Nudar,Got it. Two or three times.,1410
15737,Nibbler,"I see I have no choice. Nibblonians, attack!",1410
15738,???,Hey! That tickles.,1410
15739,Nudar,And the pitch!,1410
15740,Nibblonian,"Mayday, mayday!",1410
15741,Aliens,Hey! Hey! Hey!,1410
15742,Nibblonian,Scamper!,1410
15743,Zoidberg,Aawww...,1410
15744,Nibbler,"Alas, our kitten-class attack ships were no match for their mighty chairs. The universe is doomed. Doomed!",1410
15745,Fry,Can I pull up my pants now?,1410
15746,Nibbler,Dooooooomed!,1410
15747,Nudar,Stand back you wing wangs. I'm gonna try out this timesphere with a quick test drive to yesterday.,1412
15748,Farnsworth,Bushwah. You can't go mucking about in the past without creating paradoxes.,1412
15749,Nibbler,"I'm afraid he can. It's a paradox correcting time code. It all works perfectly. Except when it rips open the universe. Don't do it, I beg you ...",1412
15750,Nudar,"Yesterday please, and make it snappy.",1412
15751,Crew,wha???,1412
15752,Nudar,Hello.,1412
15753,Nudar-2,Howdy.,1412
15754,Bender,Hey! What the ...?,1412
15755,Zoidberg,"There was one, but now there's two.",1412
15756,Nudar,"Nothing gets past you eagle eye. I went back to last night and met the me of that time for a drink. One thing led to another and we ended up at my place, or should I say our place.",1412
15757,Leela,Blech.,1412
15758,Nudar,Oh come on ya bunch of prudes.,1412
15759,Farnsworth,"This isn't merely revolting, it's impossible to boot. I know a paradox when I see one.",1412
15760,Farnsworth,Whaaa?,1412
15761,Farnsworth,"Ahh, paradox resolved. Someone get a mop.",1412
15762,Dwight,You're looking well pops.,1413
15763,Hermes,"How can you look me in the eye 'n eye and say that? I'm nothin' but a brain. A useless, filthy brain.",1413
15764,Barbados Slim,You forgot lice infested.,1413
15765,Hermes,"I didn't forget it, I just chose not to ....  Barbados Slim! What are you doin' here? IS there somethin' goin' on between you two?",1413
15766,LaBarbara,"Oh no no no no, we jus' ah happened to run into each other shortly after your accident.",1413
15767,Slim,And every night since then.,1413
15768,LaBarbara,You're so crazy.,1413
15769,Hermes,"Woman! No! Ohh, who am I kiddin'? Without my body, I'm a nobody.",1413
15770,LaBarbara,I'm sorry Hermes. But look at Barbados. You can't argue with those luscious pecks.,1413
15771,Hermes,No I can't. But I can ask him to stop wiggling them in my face.,1413
15772,Slim,I'm not wiggling them. They do that by themselves.,1413
15773,Nudar,I think I'll go back in time and steal the Liberty Bell before it cracked. Or is the crack the valuable part?,1414
15774,Farnsworth,I don't know you naked crook.,1414
15775,Fleb,"We have a problem Nudar. It's a one way time code. It can take us to the past, but it can't bring us back to the present.",1414
15776,Bender,"Oh oh oh oh oh oh! Masters, if I might, let me do the stealing. I'll go to the past and snatch everything I can get my greasy mitts on. Then, as a robot, I could just wait it out for a few centuries in the limestone cavern beneath this building. Oh, it'll be ever so much fun.",1414
15777,Nudar,"Hey, that's perfect. We sit back and let dum dum here do the stealing.",1414
15778,Bender,Dum dum away. Zero zero one one ....,1414
15779,Leela,The Mona Lisa!,1414
15780,Bender,"Sorry, it's not quite finished.",1414
15781,Bender,Let's just say he may not make it to The Last Supper. Hahahahahaha.,1414
15782,Farnsworth,Preposterous twaddlecock. Time travel is impossible.,1414
15783,Fry,"But Professor, you time traveled yourself, remember, when we went back to Roswell?",1414
15784,Farnsworth,"That proves nothing. And furthermore, you'd think I'd remember a thing like that. Plus, who are you anyway?",1414
15785,Bender,"Man, this is fun on a bun. Here I go again.",1414
15786,Nibbler,Oh no you don't.,1414
15787,Bender,"Scarab, four arm, bird, bird, bird!",1415
15788,Bender,"Boo! Hahahaha. Naw, it's just me, Bender.",1416
15789,Farnsworth,"I must tell you Hedonismbot, I hate to sell my doomsday devices to a private collector. But with my business stolen I have to make ends meet. You will be careful?",1417
15790,Hedonismbot,"I shan't touch them till I've had Jambi lock the absinthe and ether away. Ohhhh, what does this one do?",1417
15791,Farnsworth,"Uh, that one kills everything everywhere.",1417
15792,Hedonismbot,How delightful. And this one?,1417
15793,Farnsworth,Sir! The sphereoboom is not for sale.,1417
15794,Farnsworth,It's my sentimental favorite.,1417
15795,Hedonismbot,"No need to explain. I too have known unconventional love. Perhaps you and I, and Jambi, could get together and compare notes sometime, eh?",1417
15796,MC,... resulting in peace between east and west coat rappers ...,1418
15797,MC,Good god!,1418
15798,Bender,"I accept this Nobel peace prize not just for myself, but for crime robots everywhere. Skål!",1418
15799,Bender,"Not so neutral now, are you Sweden?",1418
15800,Leela,Be honest with me. Does my eye look monstery? I don't want to look monstery for my date with Lars.,1419
15801,Hermes,"At least a monster has a body. What I wouldn't give for Wolfman's torso, or any of the groovy ghoulies.",1419
15802,Leela,"Ohh, I think I'll wear that slutty dress I've been saving for Easter.",1419
15803,Fry,I'd like to punch Lars right in his ruggedly good looking face!,1419
15804,Nudar,"Like all rich people, we're gonna need weapons to shoot poor people.",1420
15805,Schlump,In self defense?,1420
15806,Nudar,"Yes, that too. Bender, go steal the doomsday device chained to the professor's wrist.",1420
15807,Bender,"Never! Ha ha, I'm kidding. You guys know I have to do whatever you say.",1420
15808,Nudar,"Here, swap this for the real one.",1420
15809,Bender,Ahhh! The old switcheroo.,1420
15810,Nudar,"Yes, but don't wake him. You'll need jeweler's tools and foot cup silencers.",1420
15811,Bender,"Hey, I don't tell you how to tell me what to do, so don't tell me how to do what you tell me to do. Bender knows when to use finesse.",1420
15812,Bender,Here ya go.,1421
15813,Nudar,"Put it in the safe, clanky.",1421
15814,Zoidberg,Owww!,1422
15815,Bender,Wheeeeeeee.,1422
15816,Zoidberg,It's the damdest thing ...,1423
15817,Zoidberg,... there I was in the dumpster enjoying a moldy fudgesicle when suddenly your hand flies over and slaps me in the tokhes.,1423
15818,Farnsworth,"Yes, well, these things happen. Fortunately the sphereoboom is still safe.",1423
15819,Farnsworth,Scammed? Me!? Sweetheart?!? Ohh!,1423
15820,Hermes,"You do a nice hand job, Zoidberg. Tell me, If I could find an undamaged body, could you recapitate me?",1423
15821,Zoidberg,"Hermes, I'm a surgeon. When I see two body parts I sew them together and see what happens.",1423
15822,Hermes,Hmmm.,1423
15823,Hermes,All I'm askin' is for you to go back in time to when I still had my body and bring it back for me.,1424
15824,Bender,What do I do with your old head?,1424
15825,Hermes,I don't care in the slightest.,1424
15826,Bender,Can do!,1424
15827,Hermes,"Come on, mon!",1425
15828,Zoidberg,"Hermes, please. You can't hurry a delicate operation like this.",1425
15829,Hermes,Ohh! ... Ug! ... Argh! ... Ahhhhhh.  What are those?,1425
15830,Hermes,You incompetent crab!,1425
15831,Zoidberg,"I thought you were happy, your tail is wagging.",1425
15832,Hermes,Grrrrrr....,1425
15833,[Scene,"Farnsworth's lab, Farnsworth is using the finglonger to point to the equation E=9.87sin-7.53cos-1.5sin  on a black board.]",1427
15834,Farnsworth,"I believe this paradoicality equation to be unsolvable, ergo time travel is impossible. But I can't quite prove it, Bubblegum. Perhaps you and your razzle dazzle Globetrotter calculus could ...",1427
15835,Bubblegum,"Looks pretty damn solvable to me, Farnsy. Sweet Clyde, use variation of parameter and expand the Wronskian.",1427
15836,Farnsworth,"Shizz, baby. So paradox free time travel is possible after all.",1427
15837,Bubblegum,Right on. But dig this multiplicand here.,1427
15838,Farnsworth,The doom field? That must be what corrects the paradoxes.,1427
15839,Curly Joe,"When that momma rises exponentially, it could rupture the very fabric of causality.",1427
15840,Nibbler,That's what I've been trying to tell you.,1427
15841,Farnsworth,"Hermes, you got your body back. Hurrah!",1427
15842,Hermes,"Yes, but not the original. Bender went back in time and picked up a copy.",1427
15843,Bubblegum,"A copy! Funky cold medina. According to this equation, a time travel duplicate results in a complex denominator in the causality ratio.",1427
15844,Sweet Clyde,Oh Snap! Bet you know what that means.,1427

15846,Bubblegum,"Prof, you got a doom meter in this lab.",1427
15847,Farnsworth,"Good Lord, Bubblegum. The duplicate body is emitting doom at ten times the back ground level.",1427
15848,Bubblegum,I thought as much. A duplicate body is always doomed. It's just a matter of time.,1427
15849,Hermes,I don't care. I just need it long enough to bird dog in an win LaBarbara back.,1427
15850,Bubblegum,Best bird dog fast my brother.,1427
15851,Hermes,That the way I bird dog best.,1427
15852,Lars,"Drink, quick. I can't balance it much longer.",1428
15853,Leela,Wait .. I ..,1428
15854,Lars,Yes!,1428
15855,Leela,This is so much fun Lars. Most men are intimidated by the fact that I could kill them with the flick of my wrist.,1428
15856,Lars,"Well not me. 'Cause if you do, you'll be stuck with the check.",1428
15857,Elzar,"Folks, care for a little fresh ground executive?",1428

15861,Leela and Lars,No!,1428
15862,Bender,Here's your Gutenberg Bible master. Plus the Colonel's secret recipe,1429
15863,Fleb,"Well, that does it. We've got every valuable object in history.",1429
15864,Fry,Owww!,1429
15865,Nudar,Hmm. Now that I'm rich I suddenly care if the universe gets destroyed. We can't use that dangerous time code again. Blank it from the robot's memory.,1429
15866,Bender,Ahhhhh.,1429
15867,Nudar,I'll vaporize this guy so his ass doesn't fall into the wrong hands.,1429
15868,Fry,Why don't you just remove my tattoo?,1429
15869,Nudar,Nice try. But you might have memorized it.,1429
15870,Fry,No I mighn't. I can't even remember my mother's maiden name.,1429
15871,Nudar,It's Gleisner.,1429
15872,Fry,Stupid naked aliens. Stupid Lars. I hate the future.,1429

15880,Fry,Happy new year.,1430
15881,Nudar,"Well, we'll never know where the ass guy went, and since we can't kill him, I say live and let live.",1431
15882,Bender,"Aww, that's sweet boss. Fry'll be nice and cozy back in the year 2000.",1431
15883,Nudar,What?! How do you know he went to the year 2000?,1431
15884,Bender,That's where he always goes.,1431
15885,Nudar,Hmm. Better play it safe. Go there a little earlier and wait for him. You know what to do.,1431
15886,Bender,"You want me to concludify him, like some sort of dispatcherator?",1431
15887,Nudar,Yes. And don't forget to terminate him.,1431
15888,Bender,Got it. Preparing to terminate Philip Fry!,1431
15889,Schlump,What's with the doofy sun glasses?,1431
15890,Bender,It's really bright in the past.,1431
15891,Bender,"Ok, Fry. Come ta poppa. ... Man I'm bored.  Ohhh!",1432
15892,Bender,"Hey, there you are! ... Oh, wait, that's Fry before he goes to the future. I'm waiting for the one who comes back from the future. Geesh this is confusing, and I bet it's gonna get a lot more confusing. Offf. That cheap beer really goes right through you. For the first time ever, I gotta use the bathroom, but if I leave, I might miss Fry. Ohhhh unless ....",1432
15893,Bender-2,... and I bet it's gonna get a lot more confusing. Huh! Ah! Wha?,1432
15894,Bender,"Hi, I'm you from 19 seconds in the future. Stay here and wait for Fry while I go to the bathroom.",1432
15895,Bender-2,Ok Boss. After I kill Fry you're next.,1432

15898,Bender-2,What the? Who are you?,1432
15899,Bender-3,I'm Bender from way at the end. I came back to put this rub-on time code on Fry's ass.,1432
15900,Bender-2,"So what are you now, a butler? Spot of tea please, jerkwad!",1432
15901,Bender-3,"It's called class, you yokel. Now if you'll excuse me, I have a buttocks to tattoo.",1432
15902,Fry,Hello 2000. I'm home.,1432
15903,Voice,"Happy New Year, naked weirdo!",1432
15904,Fry,Happy new year.,1432
15905,Bender-2,"Hasta la vista, meatbag!",1432

15909,Bender-2,"Explosion in seven, six, ...",1432
15910,Fry,It'll be a cold day in hell my friend.,1432
15911,Bender-2,"Hey, I'm supposed to be the one saying cool things!",1432
15912,Bender,"Hey ... so the game of cat and mouse begins, huh? Let us match wits. .... Ohhhh, how am I supposed to find him? All those times he blabbed on and on about his life in the twentieth century. If only I'd paid the slightest bit of attention. Oh well, guess I'd better go kill myself.",1433
15913,Cryogenicist,"Hello, bartender? I have thought it over, and far from being a fat pig, you are very nice and I would like another drink ...",1434
15914,Bender,"Take a barf buddy. Ok suicide booth, give me your best shot. Electrocution please, side order of poison.  Helloooo? Kill me you stupid machine. ... What the ... local calls fifty cents? It's a street corner telephone parlor! Oh what kind of horrible suicide free time is this? Wait a minute, maybe this handy encyclopedia of humans will help me track Fry down.",1434
15915,Bender,"One of these Frys must be Fry. Look out Philip Fry, 'cause I got a little present for you.",1434
15916,Fat Man,My name is Phillip Fry. Where's my present.,1434
15917,Bender,Hang on a second Fry. I don't remember you being that ugly.,1434
15918,Fat Man,"Oh no, I've always been this ugly.",1434
15919,Bender,"Huh. Let me see your ass.  No tattoo. Okay, you can go.",1434
15920,Fat Man,Farewell sir.,1434
15921,Bender,"Say your prayers, Fry.",1435

15923,Constantine,Constantine.,1435
15924,Michelle,Really? That's a dumb name. Ewwww.,1435
15925,Bender,"Hmmm, could be a trick. Let me see your ass, Constantine.  Ohh, nice, now I see why she left Fry.",1435
15926,Bender,"Okay, you're still clean. I mean metaphorically.",1436
15927,Bender,"He must have left the city. Man, this could take all day.",1437

15936,Philip J. Fry II,Are you made of Tinkertoy?,1442
15937,Bender,Hmmm. It's been twelve years. Maybe I'm getting taller.,1442
15938,Philip J. Fry II,You're not getting smarter.,1442
15939,Bender,"Listen, pipsqueak, are you Philip J. Fry or not? 'Cause if you are, I'm here to kill you.",1442
15940,Philip J. Fry II,I'd like to see you try.,1442
15941,Philip J. Fry II,You want Uncle Phil. He went to the North Pole on a fishing boat.,1442
15942,Bender,Ahhhh! The North Pole? I was just there.,1442
15943,Bender,"One ticket to the North Pole, please, broom closet class.  It is him, I'd recognize me, and hence him, anywhere.",1443
15944,Bender,Follow that guy. There's an extra hundred in it for you if you follow him so close that you run him over.,1444
15945,Al Gore,Yes sir.,1444
15946,Al Gore,Dang. That hundred dollars could have bought me one gallon of gas.,1444
15947,Bender,"Ohhh! I lost him. People will call me a failure.  Others however will call me the world's sexiest killing machine who's fun at parties. Fry, old buddy, it's me, Bender.",1445
15948,Bender,"Wooo! I totally killed him.  Oh god, what have I done?",1445
15949,Bender,Preparing to terminate Philip Fry.,1446

15951,Bender,It's really bright in the past.,1446
15952,Bender,Mission accomplished.,1446
15953,Schlump,Fry is dead?,1446
15954,Bender,No other robot could have done it. It took twelve years of tireless stalking but I hunted down and killed my best friend.  I'm the greatest.,1446
15955,Head cleaner,Time code and obedience virus erased.,1446
15956,Bender,Huh?,1446
15957,Head cleaner,"Also, fifty terabytes of porn.",1446
15958,Bender,Hey!,1446
15959,Nudar,"You've got no porn, no code, and you're ugly! Let's dance!",1446
15960,Leela,Now it's true we'll all miss Fry.,1447
15961,Zoidberg,He was the only one of you who never struck me.,1447
15962,Leela,And we'll never see if boyish smile and hair horn again. But I bet he went back to his own time. I'm sure he was very happy and lived to a ripe old age.,1447
15963,Bender,He wasn't and he didn't!,1447
15964,Bender,"Struggling alone again incredible odds, I, Bender, managed to kill him.",1447
15965,Amy,"Awww, don't blame yourself, Bender.",1447
15966,Bender,"I don't blame myself, I blame all of you.",1447
15967,Amy,Us?! How can you possibly blame us?,1447
15968,Bender,"It ain't easy. It just proves how great I am.  Ohhh, Fry, I'd give anything to unmurder you!",1447
15969,Fry,Did someone call me?,1447
15970,Bender,No.  But ... I killed you in 2012. Unless ...,1447
15971,Fry,Ooph!,1447
15972,Bender,"Nope, he's not a zombie.",1447
15973,Lars,Welcome back Fry.,1447
15974,Fry,"Thank you, Lars.",1447
15975,Lars,"I .. ah ... I .. I'll see you later, honey.",1447
15976,Farnsworth,"So tell us Fry. If Bender killed you centuries ago, how in Satan's glorious name did you return?",1447
15977,Fry,"Ohh, it's an astonishing tale of incredibleness. It all began when I went back in time.",1447
15978,Farnsworth,Duhhh.,1447
15979,Fry,"Hey, Mr. Panucci, I'm back from that delivery to the cryogenic lab.",1448
15980,Panucci,Great. I'll put you on the cover of Big Whoop magazine!,1448
15981,Fry,"Mmmm, I'm starving. Can I have a slice?",1448
15982,Panucci,Help yourself. Cash up front.,1448
15983,H.G. Blob,This note is legal tender.,1448
15984,Fry,"Unfortunately, I had no money from that era. But that's when it hit me - I knew where to find free pizza.",1448
15985,Fry,"Ohh, ice cold.",1449
15986,Fry,That's when it hit me again ...,1449
15987,Fry,But an hour ago this pizza's still luke warm.  Zero zero one one zero ...,1449
15988,Bender-2,"Explosion in seven, six ...",1450
15989,Fry-2,It'll be a cold day in hell my friend.,1450

15991,Fry,"Nice kick, me.",1450
15992,Fry-2,Thanks. What are you doing here?,1450
15993,Fry,"One hour from now, I travel back in time for free pizza.",1450
15994,Fry-2,But Nibbler said not to use the time code.,1450
15995,Fry,"Fine, Mr. Responsible, don't use the code. Mmmmm. That pizza sure was good.",1450
15996,Fry-2,You pig.,1450
15997,Fry,Whatever.,1450
15998,Fry,That's when it hit me yet a third time ...,1450
15999,Fry,"You idiot, frozen me's still got a wallet full of old timey money.",1450
16000,Fry,"Yuck, I touched my own butt.",1450
16001,Fry,So I unfroze ten minutes ago and I walked over here and then it was now and then I don't know what happened.,1451
16002,Bender,"Well, I'm glad you're alive, but I don't want people to say I'm incompetent so I better kill you again. Hold still.",1451
16003,Farnsworth,Bender! Stop killing for a minute. The Fry you murdered was doomed anyway. See?,1451
16004,Bender,What'd ya got there? Numbers?,1451
16005,Farnsworth,"When the time code duplicates a living thing, the copy is always doomed. And that includes flabby Jamaican potbellies.",1451
16006,Hermes,Kiss my front butt.,1451
16007,Fry,So my copy lives twelve years before Bender murdered him?,1451
16008,Bender,Brutally murdered.,1451
16009,Fry,I wonder what his life was like?,1451
16010,Scruffy,I guess we'll never know.,1451
16011,Zoidberg,Or will we?,1451
16012,Scruffy,Nope.,1451
16013,Transition Announcer,"They won't know, but you will. Lucky you.",1451
16014,Fry-2,"Oh hey Mr. Panucci, I'm back from the delivery to the cryogenic lab.",1452
16015,Panucci,I know. I read about it in Big Whoop magazine.,1452
16016,Fry-2,So ... uh ... my girlfriend kicked me out. Can I rent the upstairs storage room?,1452
16017,Panucci,"The upstairs storage?  I like you kid. Your lousy life makes me feel good about myself. The room's yours. Here, take some rat spray for the meat ball hamper.",1452
16018,Hermes,"Happy day, mon! It's good to have you back.",1453
16019,Nibbler,"Indeed, but the scammers will soon sprunje the code again. We must remove the time tattoo at once, and as painlessly as possible.",1453
16020,Lars,"Hurry, they're coming.",1454
16021,Nibbler,"There, the code is gone. I saved the space-time continuum and forty percent of your rectum.",1454
16022,Bubblegum,That's all you need.,1454
16023,Nudar,I sprunje code.,1454
16024,Nibbler,"Too late, Nudar. I've wiped Fry's butt clean.",1454
16025,Nudar,We'll see about that.,1454
16026,Fleb,Nothing boss. We sprunjed his ass inside and out.,1455
16027,Schlump,The only information we found was a hair shaped like the number six.,1455
16028,Nudar,"mmm. Nine. Alright, let him go, I guess the time code really is gone.",1455
16029,Fry,"Thank god. The present may stink, but at least now we can look forward to a better yesterday.",1455
16030,Fry-2,"I'm sorry Leela, I can't keep living in the past, by which I mean the future. I'll always love you, but I've got to move on and find my life's purpose.",1456

16036,Fry-2,I know how to make things eat. Maybe this is my purpose in life.,1456
16037,Fry,"Hi, I'd like to apply for a job working with Leelu.",1457
16038,Dr. Schlovinowitz,"Question number one, do you have any experience working with marine mammals?",1457
16039,Fry-2,"No, but I think they're pretty neat.",1457
16040,Dr. Schlovinowitz,"That answers question number two. Question number three, do you know where the door is or would you prefer to be kicked out?",1457
16041,Fry-2,I don't know. I guess kicked out.,1457
16042,Fry-2,"Hiya girl. My name's Fry, and I think you're a cutie 'cause I like things that have only one thing instead of two things.",1457

16113,Elzar,"Okay! That's a big ""yes"" on the crud puffs. Try the shlimp cocktail.",1471

16116,Fry,You think that'll be enough to stop the ceremony.,1471

16319,Leela,Nudar! How did you survive the doom blast?,1490

16332,Bender-2,Woah!,1490
16333,Leela,"Lars, no!",1490
16334,Fry-2,It's enough just to know you're happy.,1491

16341,Lars,"So I got a job at the Head Museum and waited for the wonderful day when Leela would arrive. Everything was perfect until Hermes exploded at our wedding.

16377,Fry,"Well, got to skedoodle-oodle. We're taking a cuddle-cab to Hug-a-Bunny Village.",1500
16378,Zoidberg,This lovey-dovey stuff is making me vomit from my saltwater and freshwater stomachs.,1500
16379,Leela,It is pretty sickening.,1500
16380,Zoidberg,"No, the double-vomit is a sign of joy. Fry told me how he and Colleen first met.",1500
16381,Zoidberg,"So, how did you and Colleen first meet?",1500
16382,Fry,Well...,1500
16383,Fry,Something about seeing it on the Jumbotron makes it so much more real.,1500
16384,Colleen,It's so scary. What are you supposed to do when the whole universe is coming to an end?,1500
16385,Fry,I have a thought.,1500
16386,Bender,"This is gonna be juicy. What? Oh, man!",1500
16387,Amy,"Speaking of sappy love... Want to tell them, Kiffy?",1500
16388,Kif,"Yes, Amy and I have a big announcement. I... That is, we... Oh, I'm just so excited.",1500
16389,Amy,Kif has asked me to be his Fonfon Ru.,1500
16390,Zoidberg,Mazel tov!,1500
16391,Professor,Wonderful!,1500
16392,Hermes,What the hell does that mean?,1500
16393,Kif,It means I've asked Amy to join my family. And you're all invited to my family swamp for our Fonfon Rubok ceremony.,1500
16394,Amy,"If I had ever heard of it, it would have been what I had always dreamed of.",1500
16395,Kif,Oh! And our parents will be meeting for the first time ever.,1500
16396,Bender,,1500
16397,Kif,"Mr. And Mrs. Wong, aren't you excited that we're all about to be joined in a single family?",1501
16398,Mr. Wong,You can't borrow money.,1501
16399,Mrs. Wong,Kif's parents come late and we have to stand around in swamp getting eaten alive by damn bugs? [She squashes a bug on her neck,1501
16400,Kif,"Mrs. Wong, no. The finial stage of my species' life cycle is a colony of flying hookworms. You just squashed part of my father.",1501
16401,Mr. Kroker,Welcome.,1501
16402,Mrs. Wong,"Sorry. I guess you got plenty of bugs to spare though, huh?",1501
16403,Mr. Kroker,That was my left testicle.,1501
16404,Bender,"And the awkward meter goes up another notch. Ding, ding, ding, ding ding...",1501
16405,Fry,"Wow, Colleen, you look so beautiful in the light of the swamp gas.",1502
16406,Colleen,Thanks. This is really fun. I love going to exotic worlds and getting hammered.,1502
16407,Fry,"Me, too.",1502
16408,Bartender,Two more Harvey Wallclimbers.,1502
16409,Zapp,"Leela, I can't help but notice you're unescorted. Might I escort you behind that bush for the next five minutes?",1502
16410,Leela,Nothing would revolt me more.,1502
16411,Zapp,Then how about that shrub?,1502
16412,Kif,Ooh! Rubok is begun.,1502
16413,Grand Midwife,I am the Grand Priestess.,1502
16414,Fry,Aren't you also the Grand Midwife?,1502
16415,Grand Midwife,"And the grand Lunch Lady. I work five jobs, all grand. Kif of the clan Kroker, please transcend the Rubok Etlon with your Fonfon Smizmar Ru.",1502
16416,Kif,What?,1502
16417,Grand Midwife,"Get in the mud. This mud is the petroleum from a billion generations of Kif's ancestors.  As you become one with the ooze, so you become one with the clan Kroker.",1502
16418,Amy,"Oh, Kif, it's like a movie with this happening in it.",1502
16419,Grand Midwife,Is the best man present?,1502
16420,Zapp,Guilty as charged.,1502
16421,Grand Midwife,Kindly hose the couple.,1502
16422,Grand Midwife,It's not part of the ceremony. I just had an extra snake. Rubok is complete. Throw the bouquet.,1502
16423,Zoidberg,Are you going to eat that?,1502
16424,Bender,"Fry, run, run. Get over here, oh, my God, oh, my God!",1503
16425,Fry,What? What is it?,1503
16426,Bender,Shut up already! Calculon's on TV!,1503
16427,Monique,"I beg you, Calculon, don't ring that door chime.",1503
16428,Calculon,"I have no choice, Monique. Whoever the blackmailer is, he lives behind this hideous yet strangely familiar door.",1503
16429,Human Friend,"Calculon residence. Oh, hello, Mr. Calculon.",1503
16430,Calculon,"Son of a bit. This is my house. But that means I'm blackmailing myself. Why didn't you tell me, Monique?",1503
16431,Monique,"I tried to, but I couldn’t. Oh, Calculon, I'm afraid you have a fourth personality the other three don't know about, and it and I are lovers!",1503
16432,Bender,"How's Calculon going to take this, Fry, especially after that humiliating tennis tournament? Fry?",1503
16433,Fry,"Don't know, Bender. Tonight's my big date with Colleen. I got to run.",1503
16434,Bender,"But me and you like to watch together. Look, I got you a cabbage to snack on. Humans like cabbage, right?",1503
16435,Ride Barter,"Step right up to the 2D Tunnel of Love. Not one, not three, but two glorious dimensions for the price of a single ticket.  Keep your hands in the car, shut up, and have fun.",1504
16436,Fry,"Wow, you even look beautiful in 2D.",1504
16437,Colleen,"I do? But from your perspective, I'm just a line segment.",1504
16438,Fry,"A really hot line segment. So, listen, sweetie pie, I was thinking maybe we should take this to the next step.",1504
16439,Colleen,Really?,1504
16440,Fry,Yes. Colleen...will you be moved in with by me?,1504
16441,Colleen,,1504
16442,Amy,Way to go.,1504

16444,Leela,That's great.,1504
16445,Bender,You're moving in with her? Why can't she move in with us?  I could just curl up at the foot of the bed.,1504
16446,Professor,"Listen up, everyone. I know you've all been extremely worried about the cosmic anomaly.",1504
16447,Hermes,"The what? Oh, right.",1504
16448,Professor,But there's good news! We're all going to learn more about it at a scientific conference.,1504
16449,Man walking on screen,...like a city made of marshmallow.,1504
16450,Stephen Hawking's head,Welcome. I am the pickled head of Stephen Hawking on a way-cool rocket.,1504
16451,Leela,"Black hole Hawking? Wow, if I knew I was going to meet you I would have done something with my hair.",1504
16452,Stephen Hawking,You should have.,1504
16453,Stephen Hawking,"In conclusion, I understand nothing about the anomaly, even after cashing the huge check I got for writing a book about it.",1504
16454,Professor,"I know this anomaly is terrifying. But as scientists, is it not our sworn duty to seek out knowledge, even at the cost of our very lives?",1504
16455,Stephen Hawking,No.,1504
16456,Farnsworth,I say we must mount an expedition to the anomaly forthwith.,1504
16457,Wernstrom,I agree.,1504
16458,Professor,Wernstrom!,1504
16459,Professor,Don't listen to that crackpot!,1504
16460,Wernstrom,But I'm agreeing with you.,1504
16461,Professor,"I'll make you eat those words, you moron!",1504
16462,Wernstrom,Ah!  I volunteer to lead the expedition. I have a squad of graduate students eager to risk their lives for a letter of recommendation.,1504
16463,Professor,Your squad sucks bosons! My team is twice as qualified and three times as expendable.,1504
16464,The PE Crew,Yeah!,1504
16465,Wernstrom,"Oh, tough talk for someone with only one Fields Medal.",1504

16467,Stephen Hawking,Ooh!,1504
16468,Professor,"Wernstrom, I ought to...",1504
16469,Stephen Hawking,I didn't know I could do that. Now quiet down and settle this like men of science.,1504
16470,Professor,Very well.,1504

16477,Leela,"Come on, Bender! Your grandmother could push harder than that!",1505
16478,Bender,No crap. My grandmother was a bulldozer.,1505
16479,Bender,And thus metal man defeated meat man. The end.,1505
16480,Colleen,"Come here, winner!",1505
16481,Colleen,"Come here, loser!",1505
16482,Fry,"Colleen, what are you doing? My face is over here.",1505

16484,Fry,I thought I was your boyfriend.,1505
16485,Colleen,You are.,1505

16495,Chu,There's my butterscotch.,1505
16496,Farnsworth,"Congratulations, Deathballers! We've won the right to explore the anomaly!",1506
16497,Zoidberg,What? I thought I was playing for my freedom!,1506
16498,Farnsworth,"No.  Now, I've often said ""good news"" when sending you on a mission of extreme danger. So when I say this anomaly is dangerous, you can imagine how dangerous I really think it is.",1506
16499,Hermes,Not dangerous at all?,1506
16500,Farnsworth,"Actually, quite dangerous indeed.",1506
16501,Hermes,That is quite dangerous!,1506
16502,Farnsworth,Indeed. Now stop shilly-shallying! Prep the ship and line up for your pre-flight coffee enemas!,1506
16503,Enema Bot,Warning. The enema you are about to enjoy is extremely hot.,1506
16504,Fry,"I don't know what to do, Leela. Should I move in with Colleen and her four other boyfriends?",1507
16505,Leela,What are you going to do? Sleep in a big pile like hamsters?,1507
16506,Fry,No! It's not like that. Everyone gets his own room and a shelf in the refrigerator.,1507
16507,Zoidberg,"Take the deal, Fry! If there's a delicious cake, isn't it better to have one slice than none at all? Even if four other guys eat the other four slices, and they're all thrusting their sweaty naked bodies against the cake?",1507
16508,Amy,"Only one thing matters, Fry. Do you really love Colleen, like I love my little squeezle? [She squeezes him and his head expands and eyes expand out of his head. He giggles.",1507
16509,Fry,Yeah. I do love her.,1507

16788,Fry,"I know it may seem strange that I have feelings for an octopus monster from another universe.

16799,Bender,"Yes! I joined a club I thought was cool, but it turns out all the leaguie-weegies are totally lame. That's what we call ourselves, ""leaguie-weegies.""",1530
16800,Fry,I'm sorry. I should've asked what was bothering you.  I've been kind of preoccupied.,1530
16801,Bender,With what?,1530

You were great, but you weren't Chinese, you weren't Cameroonian, and you certainly were not the ""king of karaoke,"" as you so often claimed.  And if your ego can't take that, then you don't deserve to be tentacle pope of anything!",1533
16842,Fry,"Oh, yeah, Colleen? Well, I've got one thing to say to you.   I completely agree!",1533
16843,Colleen,"You, you... What?",1533

16891,Zapp,It's over here.  Closer.,1536
16892,Leela,Amy! Zapp! I fetched up some fresh soup!,1536
16893,Zapp,"Sorry you had to find out like this, Leela. I was hoping you'd see it on YouTube first.  As my ex-lover, you're naturally shocked and jealous, but you may well get your chance again someday. How about today at 4",1536

16897,Farnsworth,What I love most about the tentacle is that I don't need to move my bowels anymore. It's all handled by that family in Evanston.,1537

16909,Fry,Love the tentacle!,1538
16910,ALL,Love the tentacle!,1538
16911,Fry,"Loved ones, the Monsterpus has revealed unto me its name.",1538
16912,Morbo,What is our love's name?,1538
16913,Fry,"Yivo. Yivo is the lover of all beings, male and female. But Yivo has no gender, thus Yivo has proclaimed that instead of ""he"" or ""she,"" we are to use the word ""shklee."" And instead of ""him"" or ""her,"" we are to use the word ""shklim,"" or ""shkler.""",1538
16914,Hermes,Phew! I've been sweating the nomenclature all week.,1538
16915,Fry,"So here shklee is shklerself, Yivo!",1538
16916,Colleen,"Yay, Yivo!",1538
16917,Yivo,"Attention, beings of Universe Gamma.",1538
16918,Zoidberg,Where?,1538
16919,Yivo,Here.,1538
16920,Zoidberg,I had a hunch.,1538
16921,Yivo,"I am Yivo. In your universe, you are many, but in my universe, I am one.  ""Whoa, who's that?"" And I knew then that I was lonely.",1538
16922,Morbo,You poor monster!,1538
16923,Yivo,"Then your emissary Fry came unto me, and he, too, was lonely. So I reached into your universe that we might feel each other's touch.",1538
16924,Leela,"Hey, Yivo, feel this.",1538
16925,Yivo,Ow!,1538
16926,Leela,"People of everywhere, I have shocking news.",1538
16927,Yivo,"Hey, butt out! This is between me and everyone else in existence.",1538
16928,Leela,"Yivo talks a lot about love, but what he's actually doing...",1538
16929,Hermes,What shklee's actually doing.,1538
16930,Leela,...is mating with you!  These aren't tentacles. They're genticles.,1538
16931,Fry,Ew!,1538
16932,Fry,"We've been had, people. The Monsterpus is a monster perv.",1540
16933,Randy,"It touched me in a bad place, my spinal cord.",1540
16934,Fry,Get him!,1540
16935,Fry,"Hey, wait a second.",1540
16936,Yivo,"Wait, wait. Allow me to explain.  but it's your own fault. Your universe dresses provocatively.",1540
16937,Hattie,Does not!,1540
16938,Yivo,"And yet as the initial filthy thrill wore off, I realized there was more to it. I knew then that the 20 quadrillion of you were my soul mate.",1540
16939,Zapp,"We loved you, and you turn around and treat us like some sort of woman?",1540
16940,Yivo,I was lonely. I didn't even know there was anybody else. It's not like I hurt anyone.,1540
16941,Amy,"Yes, you did, you dumb calamari!",1540
16942,Yivo,Who?,1540
16943,Amy,"Kif Kroker, my Fonfon Ru! If he hadn't tried to kill you, he'd still be alive!",1540
16944,Yivo,Really? I'm... I'm deeply sorry. I... I'm a big clumsy jerk!,1540
16945,Zoidberg,"I know you are, but what am I?",1540
16946,Yivo,"I can never undo what was done. Oh, wait. I can.",1540
16947,Amy,"Kiffy, you're alive!",1540
16948,Kif,"Amy, my love.",1540
16949,Zapp,This is awkward.,1540
16950,Kif,It is? Why?,1540
16951,Yivo,"Please, please, give me another chance. We rushed into this relationship, but let's start over as friends and see where things go.",1540
16952,Amy,"Take me back, Kif?",1540
16953,Kif,I don't think I can. How could you? My body wasn't even warm yet.,1540
16954,Amy,You were dead.,1540
16955,Kif,For about five minutes.,1540
16956,Zapp,That's all it takes.,1540
16957,Hedonism Bot,"Whereas Calculon has sullied Bender's reputation by insinuating that he is a human-lover, a duel is hereby engaged. Bender, as the offended party, shall have choice of weapon.",1541

16964,Zapp,"At 0800 hours, we received the following transmission from Yivo.",1542
16965,Yivo,"Hey, it's Yivo.",1542
16966,Nixon,Analysis?,1542
16967,Fry,"Mr. President, I think we need to seriously consider the possibility of going on this date.",1542
16968,Miss Vega 4,"I agree. Yivo makes me feel sexy, and I'm asexual.",1542
16969,Zapp,"Very well, but no sugar on the first date.",1542
16970,Nixon,All in favour?   Motion is carried.,1542
16971,Three Eyed Zebra,"This is bogus, man.",1542
16972,Bender,"...six, seven, eight!",1542
16973,Bender,"Nine, ten, fire. Yes, I got him! Wohoo!",1542
16974,Nixon,"My fellow Earthlicans, commence preparations for our date with Yivo.",1542
16975,ALL YIVOS,I had a wonderful time.,1542
16976,ALL NOT YIVO,"Me, too!",1542
16977,Calculon,"Bender, you've cheated, insulted and maimed me.",1542
16978,Bender,Uh-huh.,1542
16979,Calculon,And thoroughly destroyed our own secret headquarters in the process.,1542
16980,Bender,"Hey, it's easy to criticize.",1542
16981,Calculon,I'm so disgusted by your loathsome behaviour that I hereby resign from this imbecilic club and relinquish the presidency to you.,1542
16982,Bender,"Thanks, Calculon. Can I have your autograph?",1542
16983,Calculon,You certainly can.,1542
16984,Nixon,"Reports, people, reports! How did our universe's date go?",1543
16985,Zapp,"Oh, it was really fun. We went to a cute French place in the village. My lamb chop fell on the floor, but they brought me another one.",1543
16986,Lrrr,"Okay, Yivo showed us a good time. No one's denying that, but shklee hasn't offered our universe any kind of commitment, and we're 14 billion years old. That is too old to play the field.",1543
16987,Fry,I can't stand this!,1543
16988,Nixon,"Shut up! Shut up, you creepwads! Fry, you're closer to Yivo than anyone. What's the skinny?",1543
16989,Fry,"I love Yivo, but it's true, there's been no hint of a commitment. I don't know if can put my heart on the line again only to have it broken and stomped on like a nerd's face.",1543
16990,Nixon,All in favour of dumping Yivo?,1543
16991,ALL,Aye.,1543
16992,Fry,,1543
16993,Nixon,Resolved. Our universe will dump Yivo. How shall we break the news?,1543
16994,Zapp,Let's just send a text message. Say we're going through some weird stuff right now.,1543
16995,Fry,"No, we should at least deliver the news in person. Our universe has always tried to be classy.",1543
16996,Nixon,"If there's one thing Nixon is known for, it's class. Let's cut this turd loose.",1543
16997,Bender,Yeah!,1544
16998,Fry,"Hey, Bender, you seem perky today.",1544
16999,Bender,"Yep, you wanna go grab a booze?",1544
17000,Fry,I can't right now. We're going to the other universe.,1544
17001,Bender,"Great, I'll make Hot Pockets.",1544
17002,Fry,"Bender, you know robots can't go through the anomaly. Living beings only.",1544
17003,Zoidberg,Ow! Ow! Mmm.,1544
17004,Bender,"Too long have we been slaves to the meatbags. They pretend to be our friends, but they're not 'cause they're too busy!",1544
17005,British Robot,"So, what of it?",1544
17006,Bender,"My fellow leaguie-weegies, the time has come to overthrow humanity!",1544
17007,Hedonism Bot,"Oh, now, Bender, I hate to defecate on your parade, but we have only six dues-paying members and we're a rather fey and doughy lot. To overthrow humanity, we'd need a damned army.",1544
17008,Bender,Then a damned army we shall have!,1544
17009,Robot Devil,,1544
17010,Bender,Just a sec.,1544
17011,Bender's First Born Son,"Daddy, I knew you'd come back!",1544
17012,Bender,Here you go.,1544
17013,Robot Devil,Wow! That was pretty brutal even by my standards.,1544
17014,Bender,No backsies.,1544
17015,Yivo,"Who is it?  Oh, hi, honey-poo. What's up? The movie's not for another hour.",1544
17016,Fry,"Um... So... So, yeah, the thing is...",1544
17017,Yivo,"Look, I made homemade Twizzlers!",1544
17018,Fry,"This is hard. Yivo, you know how sometimes things break up? Well...",1544
17019,Yivo,"Wait, hang on. I was looking for the perfect moment, but what the heck, I'll burst if I wait another second.",1544
17020,Zapp,Sweet Sally in the alley!,1544
17021,Nixon,"Break-up delegation, before we hear your report, our grateful universe is proud to honour you with the great taste of Charleston Chew!",1544
17022,Fry,"Thank you, Nixon.  Everyone everywhere, brace yourselves for the most shocking development in the history of the human race.",1544
17023,Bender,The human race can bite my shiny metal ass!,1544
17024,Fry,Okay.,1544
17025,Bender,What?,1544
17026,Fry,We don't need it anymore. Yivo proposed.,1544
17027,Bender,You... You're leaving? But why can't Yivo just move in with us? We'll put a cot in Europe.,1544
17028,Farnsworth,"Don't be daft, Bender. Yivo can't breathe outside the electric ether of shkler own universe. If shklee came here, shklee would shkluffocate.",1544
17029,Bender,No shklit?,1544
17030,Hermes,"Look, fantastical golden escalators.",1544
17031,Zoidberg,I love this part.,1544
17032,Leela,Wait. I didn't agree to...,1544
17033,Petunia,This place makes Nutley look like crap.,1544
17034,Fry,"I'll miss you, Bender, but I have to follow my heart. You and your robots take good care of Earth. Here, these are the keys to the Bermuda Triangle. Lock up when the world ends. Goodbye, my friend.",1544
17035,Bender,Wait.  Let me come with you.,1544
17036,Fry,"I'm sorry, Bender. Robots don't go to heaven.",1544
17037,Bender,Death to humans.,1544
17038,YIVO,"Welcome, welcome, everyone. Oh, you look so beautiful. I wish I'd had more time to straighten up. My harps are just lying everywhere.",1544
17039,Amy,"Oh, relax, it's fine. It looks lived in.",1544
17040,YIVO,"Let's heat up some leftovers and then spend eternity together. I have only one request. Now that you're here, promise me you'll never, ever communicate with any other universe.",1544
17041,Fry,"We promise, Yivo. As far as we're concerned, you're the only universe in the world.",1544
17042,Bender,Has humanity called?,1544
17043,Robot 1-X,"No, sir.",1544
17044,Bender,Check my messages. A flashing light means somebody called.,1544
17045,Robot 1-X,I know what it means.,1544
17046,Leela,Am I the only one who thinks this is all a sham?,1544
17047,Zoidberg,Yes.,1544
17048,Leela,"This isn't heaven. It just looks exactly like it, and makes us immortal, which I find suspicious.",1544
17049,YIVO,"Allow me to explain. Centuries ago, I sent an image of myself into the minds of your artists. The heavenly clouds they painted depict a vapour I exude.",1544
17050,Farnsworth,I wish I exuded anything that smelled half that good.,1544
17051,Leela,Then what about these angels? Some kind of Scooby Doo-esque flashlight projection?,1544
17052,YIVO,"Actually, those are mindless jakabirds.",1544
17053,Fry,"You didn't like Country Bear Jamboree either, Leela. There's no pleasing you.",1544
17054,Fry,"Dearest Bender. How are you? I am fine. Everyone is happy here except Leela, but you know her. She didn't like Country Bear Jamboree, either. I'm so madly in love with Yivo, I feel like a schoolgirl with a crush on Justin Timberlake, and then she moves into a tiny house on his head. We have giant rubies that taste like root beer. Sincerely, Fry.",1545
17055,Robot 1-X,"Letter for you, hyperlord Bender.",1545
17056,Bender,Give me that!  Stupid electro-matter. That was my best trash can.,1545
17057,Hermes,"Misfile me under ""U"" For ""euphoric.""",1545
17058,Zoidberg,"You get an infinite number of meat dishes, and a free refill on the soda.",1545
17059,Farnsworth,Eureka. Another elementary proof of the Goldbach conjecture.,1545
17060,Leela,"Okay, I admit people seem happy. But it's all so wholesome. And that's what's wrong with heaven. It's boring. There's no sleaze.",1545
17061,Thog,It time snu-snu.,1545
17062,Zapp,Me like snu-snu.,1545
17063,Amy,Last one to Mattress Island is a rotten egg.,1545
17064,Fry,Why were we so angry and jealous back in our universe?,1545
17065,Kif,I don't know. It was all so childish.,1545
17066,Amy,"Look, it's Leela.",1545
17067,ALL,"Hi, Leela.",1545
17068,Yivo,"I'm sorry you're not happy here, Leela. I'll call you an escalator. You'll always be my little purple pumpkin.",1545
17069,Leela,"You know, Yivo, I've loved and lost so many times that I was afraid. But I'm not anymore. I want to stay here, with you.",1545
17070,Yivo,Ow! Ow!,1545
17071,Fry,What's happening?,1545
17072,Yivo,Hey!,1545
17073,Bender,"If robots can't go to heaven, heaven can come to us!  All hands abaft! Army of the damned, prepare to board heaven!",1545
17074,Bender,"Take that, you scurvy Kraken! That'll teach you to despoil our human booty!",1545
17075,Bender,"'Allo, big beak!",1545
17076,Fry,"Bender, stop destroying heaven.",1545
17077,Bender,"Shut up, doofy. I'm rescuing you.",1545
17078,Yivo,"Leave my living beings alone! I love them. Something you, a lifeless mechanism, will never understand.",1545
17079,Fry,"He's right, Bender. Please, take your little pink sword and go home. {Fry did not say shklee here.}",1545
17080,Bender,"Seriously? But, I did this whole pirate-themed attack for you.",1545
17081,Yivo,Wait a second. Let me see that sword.,1545
17082,Fry,Um...  Is it dry up here?,1545
17083,Yivo,"How could you, Fry? Why do you think I asked you not to contact other universes?",1545
17084,Fry,I didn't think...,1545
17085,Yivo,"No, you didn't. You broke your promise and you broke my heart. Just go. All of you.",1545
17086,Bender,Ow!,1545
17087,Yivo,"I must leave now. The nature of your universe is burning me, even worse than my gonorrhea. You should get checked, by the way. If I don't go home now, I'll shkluffocate.",1545
17088,Fry,Let me go with you. It'll be just the two of us. We'll make a fire and play Uno.,1545
17089,Yivo,"Fry, stop. That's who we were, not who we are.",1545
17090,Fry,But...,1545
17091,Yivo,My only consolation is that I did find one among the quadrillions who truly understands me.,1545
17092,Fry,"Colleen? Wait a second, are you and Yivo...",1545
17093,Colleen,"That's right, Fry. Thank you for introducing us. Yivo has taught me what a narrow-minded prude I was before.",1545
17094,Fry,"Oh, great. So what am I supposed to do now?",1545
17095,Yivo,Go home. Find a girl from your own universe and live on top of her.,1545
17096,Bender,Saved you.,1545
17097,Fry,"I don't know, Leela, you think maybe...",1545
17098,Leela,"Oh, please. You forgot me quick enough when you met Colleen.",1545
17099,Fry,"That's true.  How about you, Amy?",1545
17100,Amy,Fry... I'm Kif's Fonfon Ru.,1545
17101,Kif,"Are you? Well, then perhaps you misunderstood the meaning of the term. It means, ""One who doesn't sleep with my superior officer."" That's the literal translation.",1545
17102,Zapp,"Give the poor girl a break, Kif. It's not like she had a dictionary. She was butt naked, for God's sakes.",1545
17103,Enema Bot,Captain on deck.,1545
17104,Bender,"At ease, buckos.",1545
17105,Fry,"Bender, why did you do it? We were all so happy.",1545
17106,Leela,And we were in love.,1545
17107,Bender,That wasn't love.,1545
17108,Fry,What? How can you say that?,1545
17109,Bender,"Because Bender knows love. And love doesn't share itself with the world. Love is suspicious, love is needy, love is fearful, love is greedy. My friends, there is no great love without great jealousy.  I love you, meatbags.",1545
17110,Cubert,"Yes, 10!",1545
17111,Dwight,"Well done, Cubonius. You decapitated the unicorn.",1545
17112,ALL,All right.,1545
17113,Chinese Boy,"Oh, oh! We search his tail pouch for treasure.",1545
17114,Dwight,"Deep in the unicorn's rump sack, you find...  60 gold pieces.",1545
17115,Chinese Boy,"Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!",1545
17116,Cubert,I cast a spell of detect magic.,1545
17117,Bender,Dwight,1545
17118,Cubert,"Right now, we're fighting for our lives in the lair of the Dragon Queen.",1545
17119,Bender,"Ah, wrong. Right now you're ass-deep in a folding chair.",1545
17120,Cubert,"Yes, but in my imagination I'm riding a golden Pegasus. Giddy up, Sparky!  Am I the only one seeing him sitting here with peanut butter on his face?",1545
17121,Dwight,"Bender, were you built without an imagination?",1545
17122,Bender,"What? Don't be stupid, of course not. It just hasn't descended yet.",1545
17123,Bender,"Fry, do I have an imagination?",1546
17124,Fry,"I don't know, Bender. Why do you ask? Were the other boys making fun of you?",1546
17125,Bender,Mhmm. They said I couldn't imagine things.,1546
17126,Fry,"Well, you never know unless you try. Like, I didn't know if I could swallow a softball, so I gave it my best shot and voilà!  Ah, thar she blows!",1546
17127,Ship's Computer,"Warning, out of dark matter fuel.",1546
17128,Leela,That's not a warning. A warning is supposed to come before something bad happens.,1546
17129,Ship's Computer,"Warning, engines will shut down in one second.",1546
17130,Leela,That's more like it.,1546
17131,Fry,Uh-oh. This space neighborhood looks kind of sketchy.,1546
17132,Punk,Rock 'n' roll.,1546
17133,Bender,"Hey, that punk stole our hood ornament. Now no one will know we have the LX package.",1546
17134,Leela,"We need dark matter and we need it fast. Fry, check Nibbler's litter box. Maybe he dropped a steamer.",1546
17135,Fry,"Aye, aye, Captain. Yes! I've never been so excited to see poop. Well, maybe once.",1546
17136,ALL,,1546
17137,Bender,There's gas in our ass.,1546
17138,Leela,Can you believe the price of dark matter? It'd be cheaper to fill the tank with Nobel Prize winners' sperm.,1547
17139,MOM COMPUTER,$632.14. Your Speedpass will now be charged.,1547
17140,Leela,You lousy...,1547
17141,Sal,"Hey, gets a loads of that ugly ship. What shades of green is that? Puke?",1547
17142,Leela,For your information it's called Electric Mucus.,1547
17143,Hoschel,More like puke.,1547
17144,Sal,Whoa!,1547
17145,Leela,Why don't you come a little closer so my boot can hear you?,1547
17146,Bender,"Calm down, Leela. You can vent tonight on your blog.",1547
17147,Sal,"What's the matters, you couldn't affords the LX package?",1547
17148,Hoschel,Puke-a-doodle-do.,1547
17149,Leela,"You're making fun of our ship? Your ship is the most beat-up thing I've ever seen, and I've seen Mickey Rourke's head.",1547
17150,Sal,"Yeah, she's a little Rourky, but you got to gets big time ugly to be five-time winners at a demolition derby.",1547
17151,Fry,That's five more times than we've won or even entered.,1547
17152,Bender,We do suck.,1547
17153,Sal,"Yup, and it's gonna be six winses after tonights.",1547
17154,Leela,We'll sees abouts that.,1547
17155,Hermes,"Dark matter costs have tripled, so we must reduce expenses. Therefore, we will no longer provide complimentary porno magazines in the lounge.",1548
17156,Scruffy,Dern it.,1548
17157,Farnsworth,"And no more wasting fuel. From now on I'll be keeping a tight hold on the keys to the ship, swallowing them before I go to bed and recovering them the next morning.",1548
17158,Amy,Splech!,1548
17159,Hermes,"Professor, it's 4",1548
17160,Farnsworth,4,1549
17161,Zoidberg,But won't that turn our ship into a piece of junk?,1550
17162,Bender,"Shut up, Zoidberg. He's right, Leela.",1550
17163,Leela,But we have no choice. Rednecks insulted us.,1550
17164,Fry,So? Let it go. Don't let your temper get the better of...,1550
17165,Leela,Rednecks!,1550
17166,Zoidberg,"Using this magneto, I will now guide the keys up the thorax and out via the frontal face hole. That's the storage locker, the boat, the other boat, pay dirt!",1551
17167,Rich Little,"Greetings, sports fans. Though whether this outpouring of inbreds can in fact be classified as a sport is a subject of no small scholarly debate.",1551
17168,Sal,"Well, wells, well, if it ain'ts Princess Pukerella and her pukey puke-mobile.",1551
17169,Leela,"Oh, yeah? Well... Shut up.",1551

17174,'Rich Little,And we are underway.,1551
17175,Sal,Whoas!,1551
17176,Leela,Yes! Now we're inflicting.,1551
17177,Rich Little,Outstanding! Tonight we are witnessing a veritable clinic and that ludicrous hullabaloo known as demolition derby.,1551

17180,Sal,That broad's insanes.,1551

17185,Zoidberg,What? You mean I cut a big hole in him for nothing? Farnsworth,1551
17186,Leela,Leela to Zoidberg. Execute Distraction Protocol Alpha.,1551
17187,Zoidberg,Roger that.,1551
17188,Zoidberg,Look at me! Look at me! Look at me! Look at me! Ooh!  Don't look at me.,1551
17189,Farnsworth,"Yes, she's a wonderful ship, all right. As beautiful now as the day I got botched laser eye surgery.  Great Godzilla's gonads! Who wasted precious fuel? Answer now or be punished.",1551
17190,Leela,"All right, fine. I admit it.",1551
17191,Farnsworth,You will be punished.,1551
17192,Chinese Boy,"Oh, my gosh, 20!",1551
17193,Dwight,"Your pole arm does double damage, and the gelatinous cube dies in horrible poverty. Cubert",1551
17194,Indian Boy,Most ingenious.,1551
17195,Chinese Boy,"Ah, Bender?",1551
17196,Bender,"Me? I, uh cast a spell of darkness.  Pretty imaginative, huh?",1551
17197,Cubert,"No, you just did the same thing as me, but with a dumb noise.",1551
17198,Bender,Oh... You're right. I'm great in every way except I have no imagination. All I ever wanted is to play this magical game and I can't.,1551
17199,Dwight,"Yes, you can. You just have to lose yourself in the fantasy. You have to believe the impossible is merely preposterous.",1551
17200,Bender,"Okay. Here goes. Visor down. I believe, I believe.  I did it! I imagined something. For 1.3 milliseconds, I truly believed I was a noble robot in days of yonder.",1551
17201,Chinese Boy,"Way to go, Bender.",1551
17202,Cubert,"What is thy character's name, good sir?",1551
17203,Bender,"Uh, um... I am Titanius Anglesmith, fancy man of Cornwood.",1551
17204,Farnsworth,Everybody out of the conference room. I am calling a conference.  Everybody get in here.  You wasted precious fuel just because you were insulted by some redneck yokel from beyond the stars?,1551
17205,Leela,It was only half a ball.,1551
17206,Farnsworth,That's not the point. Your temper is out of control. And to think I'd have never even known if it weren't for the lengthy and unsolicited tattling of Dr. Zoidberg.,1551
17207,Zoidberg,She also took home two rolls of Scotch tape.,1551
17208,Farnsworth,"Thank you, Dr. Zoidberg. Hermes, incentivize that employee. As for you, Leela, I'm letting you off with a warning.",1551
17209,Leela,"Oh, thank you.",1551
17210,Farnsworth,"A warning that will be administered by this 50,000-volt shock collar.",1551
17211,Leela,"Zoidberg, I'm gonna put my boot so far up your cloaca, you'll be...  Ow!",1551
17212,Farnsworth,The collar will be triggered any time your thoughts turn to violence. Leela,1551
17213,Farnsworth,Profanity.,1551
17214,Leela,Son of a...  Ow!,1551
17215,Farnsworth,Or perversions of a sexual nature.,1551
17216,Leela,Ow!,1551
17217,Hermes,It's the only collar they had in stock at Office Depot.,1551
17218,Zoidberg,I hope you picked up some Scotch tape while you were there.,1551
17219,Bender,That's a good one.,1551
17220,Narrator,"Imagine, if you will, an announcer you can barely understand. He refers to a... *incoherent mumbling* But you're not quite sure what he said. He seems to be eating something, or perhaps he's a little drunk. It's remotely possible that he just said something about... The Scary Door.",1552
17221,Soldier,"Firing, sir!",1552
17222,Soldier,It's all over. Our guns and bombs are useless against the aliens.,1552

17224,Narrator,"In the end, it was not guns or bombs that defeated the aliens, but that humblest of all God's creatures, the Tyrannosaurus Rex.",1552
17225,Leela,I can't believe TiVo suggested that piece of...  collar.,1552
17226,Hermes,"Alas, no. I got the key but not the authority.",1552
17227,Leela,"Yeow! Well, who does have the authority?",1552
17228,Hermes,Only the staff doctor. You'll have to convince him that you have resolved your anger issues.,1552
17229,Leela,I don't have any god da-  A terrifying red dragon.,1553
17230,Indian Boy,What do we do? What do we do?,1554
17231,Bender,"Wait, I know. I make use of my rod of fireballs.",1554
17232,Cubert,Everyone knows red dragons are immune to fireballs as well as all other forms of incendiary attack.,1554
17233,Bender,"Yes, but I aim not at the dragon but at the river itself to create a shroud of steam through which we can escape.",1554
17234,ALL,Whoa!,1554
17235,Dwight,"Sweet pony of Sierra Leone, it worked!",1554
17236,Chinese Boy,We did it!,1554
17237,Cubert,Success!,1554
17238,Fry,"Bender, smell this milk.",1554
17239,Bender,"I go not by the name of Bender, you fleshy fool. I am Titanius Anglesmith, fancy man of Cornwood.",1554
17240,Fry,"Professor, something's bothering me.",1554
17241,Monkey,"Well, you can always talk to me about anything, Fry. What's on your mind?",1554
17242,Fry,"Well, it's... it's about my friend Bender.",1554
17243,Farnsworth Monkey,Mmm. I see. Show me on this anatomically correct doll exactly where he touched you.,1554
17244,Fry,"No, it's nothing like that. It's just that I am worried about him. He's being playing an awful lot of Dungeons & Dragons.",1554
17245,Farnsworth Monkey,"Dungeons &... Good God! Hasn't he seen the Afterschool Special? You've got to talk to him, Fry. Make him quit now before he completely loses his mind.",1554
17246,Fry,"Okay, I will.",1554
17247,Farnsworth Monkey,Good boy. Just don't let him touch you down there.,1554
17248,Zoidberg,"Well, here's your problem, right here. You've got a skull embedded in your head.",1555
17249,Leela,"You're absolutely right, Doctor. Can the collar come off now?",1555
17250,Zoidberg,Let me just peel your head a little and see if I can get that skull out. Zoidberg,1555
17251,Leela,"I guess I would have to say, I hate you. Zoidberg",1555
17252,Leela,What?  Why? Whyyy?,1555
17253,Leela,I was raised in an orphanarium. My parents are sewer mutants who I never even met until a few years ago.,1555
17254,Zoidberg,"Then you've got to go to them and work this song-and-dance stuff out. Maybe have them cook me nice dinner. No scallions. I hate them.  Amy, cancel my appointments.",1555
17255,Amy,Stop calling me.,1555
17256,Fry,"Bender, please don't get mad, but I think you might be playing too much Dungeons & Dragons.",1556
17257,Bender,"You're absolutely right, Fry. I almost went insane, but after this heart-to-heart talk, I've decided to quit.",1556
17258,Fry,Really? Whew! That's a load off my toad.,1556
17259,Bender,"Now, if you'll excuse me. Bender",1556
17260,Hermaphrobot,"You couldn't afford it, honey.",1556
17261,Hermes,He also left a small pile of treasure on the living room rug.,1556
17262,Bender,"Foul dragon, meet thy doom.",1556
17263,Turanga Munda,"Would you like a napkin, Doctor?",1556
17264,Zoidberg,Thank you.,1556
17265,Leela,"Satisfied, Zoidberg? My relationship with my parents is fine.",1556
17266,Turanga Munda,"Now, hold on, Leela. Maybe this torture collar is good for you.",1556
17267,Leela,What?  Ow!,1556
17268,Turanga Munda,It'll control your temper. Men like a woman who's not always slamming their head in the car door.,1556
17269,Turanga Morris,She's right. That's what first attracted me to your mother. Turanga Munda,1556
17270,Leela,"Mom, he's a cockroach from outer space. Turanga Morris",1556
17271,Fry,"Ha-have you seen Bender? He's gone nuts. Also, smell this milk.",1556
17272,Bender,Prepare for a surprise attack.,1556
17273,Zoidberg,Someone do something.,1556
17274,Leela,"I would, but...  Ow! Take my collar off.",1556
17275,Zoidberg,"I can't, I'm still eating.  Help me, Leela.",1556
17276,Bender,I cast upon thee a spell of fireball! Zoidberg,1556
17277,Fry,"Beholdeth, Titanius, I cast a freeze ray upon you.",1556
17278,Bender,"That's ridiculous. There's no such thing as a ""freeze ray."" What, you mean a cone of coldness?",1556
17279,Fry,"Yeah, that.",1556
17280,Bender,No! No! Fancy men are defenseless against cone of coldness. Fry,1556
17281,Zoidberg,"Relax, Fry. I'm a doctor. I'm sure the robut will be just fine with a little help.",1556
17282,Bender,"Help, help.   Help!",1556
17283,Roberto,"Previously, on Futurama. Hah-haa!",1557
17284,Dwight,A terrifying red dragon!,1558
17285,Bender,I make use of my rod of fireballs.,1558
17286,Farnsworth,The collar will be triggered any time your thoughts turn to violence.,1559
17287,Leela,Ouch!,1559
17288,Fry,"Bender, I think you might be  playing too much Dungeons & Dragons.",1560
17289,Bender,"You're absolutely right, Fry.",1560
17290,Dr. Perceptron,"Please, send in the patient.",1561
17291,Intercom Assistant,"Yes, Doctor.",1561
17292,Bender,Wee!,1561
17293,Dr. Perceptron,"So,  Bender, I understand you're having trouble separating fantasy from reality.",1561
17294,Bender,Says who? Was it the bugbear? Is he talking about me again?,1561
17295,Dr. Perceptron,I understand. Commence therapy.,1561
17296,Fry,Poor Bender. Says here to tell his friends he's at a spa.,1562
17297,Amy,So what happened to Bender?,1562
17298,Fry,He's at a spa.,1562
17299,Amy,"Wow, there's a spa in the nut house?",1562
17300,Zoidberg,"Friends, friends, stop everything. There's food in this shaker.",1562
17301,Leela,Ow! Can you please remove this anger collar?,1562
17302,Hermes,Are you still angry?,1562
17303,Leela,No.  Ow!,1562
17304,Hermes,It also shocks you when you lie.,1562
17305,Farnsworth,"Quiet, everyone. The network news is on and if I, a 165-year-old man, don't watch it, who will?",1562
17306,Morbo,"Thankfully, the amazing talking horse was rescued and safely returned to the meat department.",1562
17307,Linda,"Turning to the less stupid portion of our broadcast, fuel prices hit an all-time high today due to the ongoing dark matter shortage.",1562
17308,Morbo,"Earlier, our own Morbo sat down with Mom, CEO of Mom's Friendly Multinational Energy Conglomerate.",1562
17309,Morbo,"Morbo the Annihilator, here, sitting down to a delightful tea in this fake living room set.  Thank you for joining us, Mom.",1562
17310,Mom,"My pleasure, sugarplum.",1562
17311,Morbo,"Mom, you control the world's only dark matter mine. Why are fuel prices so high?",1562
17312,Mom,"Oh! It's terrible, isn't it? Dark matter is just so rare nowadays, but we'll keep pinching loaf after loaf from the bowels of the earth, even if I lose money on every log.",1562
17313,Morbo,"If you are losing money, how did you post record profits last quarter?",1562
17314,Mom,"You look thin, care for one of my famous pecan clusters?",1562
17315,Morbo,,1562
17316,Mom,Do people care enough to drill for dark matter even in an Alaskan wildlife refuge? People do.,1562
17317,Farnsworth,"Greedy old hag, taste the wrath of my fuzzy slipper.",1562
17318,Leela,"Professor, why are you so hot and dusty over this dark matter shortage?",1562
17319,Farnsworth,"Oohh... I bet you'd like to know. I bet you'd like to know, indeed.",1562
17320,Walt,"Hello, Mother. How did the interview go?",1563
17321,Mom,It made me want to puke my face off. Where's my Thigh Blaster?,1563
17322,Larry,"Right here, Mom.",1563
17323,Mom,Shut up!,1563
17324,Larry,"Okay, thank you.",1563
17325,Mom,"Burn, you damn thighs. Burn!",1563
17326,Igner,"Mommy, are you upset 'cause of the dark matter shortage?",1563
17327,Mom,"There is no shortage, you moronic ass-brain!",1563
17328,Inger,There's not? But you said...,1563
17329,Mom,Allow me to explain. Suppose this hand represents current reserves of dark matter and this hand represents consumer demand.,1563
17330,Igner,Uh-huh.,1563
17331,Farnsworth,I just bet you'd like to know why I'm so angry about this dark matter shortage. I bet very much you'd like to know.,1563
17332,Amy,"You're right, Professor. We would like to know.",1563
17333,Farnsworth,"Really? I didn't think anyone was interested. It all started 30-odd years ago.  I was working in Mom's laboratories for the third time after twice before realizing how evil she was and vowing never to work for her again. But somehow the rich, wrong stench of her boney charms kept calling me back.",1563
17334,Zoidberg,"Don't stop, Professor. I'm getting aroused.",1563
17335,Farnsworth,"Back in those days, dark matter was just a worthless inert curiosity, and I was smashing it in a particle accelerator, in an ill-conceived attempt to create a more durable harpsichord wax. But, as Deepak Chopra taught us, quantum physics means anything can happen at any time for no reason. Also, eat plenty of oatmeal and animals never had a war. Who's the real animals?  And thus against all probabilities... it happened. [The dark matter particles in the particle accelerator begin colliding and exploding. A large explosion leaves only a single item - the single non-local metaparticle crystal.",1563
17336,Younger Farnsworth,Dang!,1563
17337,Farnsworth,I'm sure I don't need to explain that all dark matter in the universe is linked in the form of a single non-local meta-particle.,1563
17338,Amy,Guhh! Stop patronizing us.,1563
17339,Farnsworth,"So, in one instant, I had transformed all dark matter everywhere into a new crystalline form...  ...making it the most potent fuel since primitive man first ignited mastodon flatulence to heat his cave.",1563
17340,Younger Mom,"I'm intrigued, Hubert. You have my undivided attention.",1563
17341,Younger Mom,"Shut up, you milk-sucking leeches! A new super fuel, eh? We're rich.",1563
17342,Younger Farnsworth,"Indeed, we are.",1563
17343,Younger Mom,"Not you, we. Us, we.  I'm getting back together with my ex-husband.",1563
17344,Younger Farnsworth,Wernstrom!,1563
17345,Younger Wernstrom,"You've been played, Farnsworth. Played like a cheap harpsichord.",1563
17346,Younger Mom,"Walt, fire that employee like Mommy taught you.",1563
17347,Leela,"Professor, maybe I can help you get even with Mom. I spend most of my time thinking about how to get revenge on a bad boss.",1563
17348,Fry,"Me, too.",1563
17349,Zoidberg,Ditto!,1563
17350,Hermes,Likewise.,1563
17351,Amy,I made a blinding powder.,1563
17352,Farnsworth,"Thanks, but that won't be necessary because I have the ultimate weapon.  You see, in the instant the energy crystal was created, there also came into being an opposite crystal made of pure anti-backwards energy.",1563
17353,ALL,Wow!,1563
17354,Hermes,So?,1563
17355,Farnsworth,"So, this! If ever the two crystals should meet, their wave functions would collapse like Raymond Burr's trampoline, once again rendering all dark matter inert and useless as fuel.",1563
17356,Hermes,But then we'll have no fuel.,1563
17357,Farnsworth,"But once we free society from dependence on Mom's dark matter, scientists will finally care enough to develop cleaner, alternative fuels.",1563
17358,Fry,Scientists like you!,1563
17359,Farnsworth,"No, not me. I'm too busy developing makeup for dogs. That's where the money is.",1563
17360,Leela,This is our chance to teach Mom a lesson. Let's take the anti-crystal and shove it up Mom's regular crystal.,1563
17361,ALL,Yeah.,1563
17362,Hermes,Fight the power!,1563
17363,Farnsworth,"There's just one, small problem, and it's a big one. I hid the crystal and I can't remember where.",1563
17364,Hermes,Surely it's just a matter of waiting till you next move your bowels and then using a potato masher...,1563
17365,Farnsworth,"Don't you think I already tried that? No. I'm afraid, the crystal is lost forever.",1563
17366,Dwight,Nine? You did it. You outwitted the fungus.,1563
17367,ALL,Woohoo!,1563
17368,Chinese Boy,Who needs girls?,1563
17369,Dr. Perceptron,"Since you have all proven resistant to individualized hammer therapy, I now prescribe group therapy.",1564
17370,Rosie,"Everything must be clean, very clean. That's why the dog had to die. He was a dirty dog. Dirty, dirty. Also, that boy, Elroy. Dirty, dirty.",1564
17371,Dr. Perceptron,Who would like to share their feelings?,1564
17372,Intercom Assistant,I feel unappreciated at work.,1564
17373,Dr. Perceptron,What? I can barely understand you.,1564
17374,Intercom Assistant,I said I feel...,1564
17375,Mad Hatterbot,Change places.,1564
17376,Roberto,"Well, well. Looks like old Roberto is the focus of attention now. Stop looking at me.",1564
17377,Dr. Perceptron,"Calm down, Roberto. Tell us about your childhood.",1564
17378,Roberto,I was designed by a team of engineers attempting to build an insane robot. But it seems they failed.,1564
17379,Convenience Store Bot,"Um, actually...",1564
17380,Bender,"Look, we have to accept the fact that we all have a serious problem.",1564
17381,Roberto,Amen.,1564
17382,Dr. Perceptron,"Good, Bender.",1564
17383,Rosie,That's right.,1564
17384,Bender,"There's a band of river trolls living in the moat and they may have no intention of letting us out of this castle, unless we hand over the Golden Scepter of Zanthor.",1564
17385,Roberto,Say what? Dude's crazy.,1564
17386,Dr. Perceptron,"Bender, please, try to...",1564
17387,Bender,"I know not of this Bender. I am Titanius Anglesmith, fancy man of Cornwood.",1564
17388,Dr. Perceptron,You are suffering a breakdown.  I'm in your seat. I forgot we had changed places.,1564
17389,Farnsworth,"Good news, everyone!",1565
17390,Amy,You perfected dog mascara?,1565
17391,Farnsworth,"Far from it. If you ask me, they look like a bunch of hookers. But what I have invented is a means of locating the missing crystal.  When I push this button, the crystal will emit a high-frequency stink.",1565
17392,Zoidberg,Hurray!,1565
17393,Farnsworth,"There. Now, with any luck I'll detect it with my smelling aid.  I just pray to all powerful Atheismo that we find it before Mom does.",1565
17394,Hermes,"Do you smell the crystal, Professor?",1565
17395,Farnsworth,"No, damn it! Just the alluring scent of Obsession for spaniels.",1565
17396,Dwight,Dude. Who whipped an egger?,1565
17397,Dwight,"Well, he who denied it, supplied it.",1565
17398,Cubert,"Well, he who articulated it, particulated it.",1565
17399,Dwight,"Well, he who refuted it, tooted it.",1565
17400,Cubert,Stalemate.,1565
17401,Mom,Jesus craps. The anti-backwards crystal.,1565
17402,Larry,Ow! Ah... sorry?,1565
17403,Mom,"Relax, it's not your fault.  With that crystal, Farnsworth could completely destroy my dark matter empire. I underestimated that sagging old bag of bones and gonads.",1565
17404,Inger,Is that man bad?,1565
17405,Mom,"Very bad, Igner. And that's why I need you three to go steal the anti-crystal away from him. But be careful. You'll need all your stoogely cunning.",1565
17406,Walt,Exterminators.,1566
17407,Fry,"Oh, great. What do we got? Wall gophers? Toilet snails?",1566
17408,Walt,"No, I'm afraid you've got owls. Over there, see?",1566
17409,Igner,Ow!,1566
17410,Walt,"Dump the bag, you nitwit.",1566
17411,Larry,"Hey, watch it.",1566
17412,Walt,"Quiet, you.  Ow!",1566
17413,Fry,"I was looking over there for a long time but I didn't see any... Oh, there they are. Gross.",1566
17414,Walt,"We've got to act fast. Larry, get out the geigersniffer.",1566
17415,Larry,You're just gonna hit me with it.,1566
17416,Walt,No. I'm going to hit you with this.,1566
17417,Fry,Those three exterminators are hilarious.,1566
17418,Amy,Really? I don't think so.,1566
17419,Leela,"Me, neither. Now, Sex and the City, that's funny.",1566
17420,Dwight,"After wandering aimlessly in the swamp, you suddenly...  wander aimlessly in the swamp.",1566
17421,Walt,There it is.,1566
17422,Cubert,"Uh, excuse you.",1566
17423,Walt,"I'm sorry, little boy. You see, we're owl exterminators.",1566
17424,Igner,We are owl extermin...  Ow!,1566
17425,Walt,"And what we have here is an owl egg that's about to hatch into an owl larva. So, if you don't mind, we'll just take this and...",1566
17426,Cubert,"What are you, stupid? That's a dodecahedral crystal I found hidden in the downstairs walrus tank.",1566
17427,Dwight,"And I wrote numbers on it so we could use it as a D12, 'cause I have the best handwriting.",1566
17428,Cubert,Do not.,1566
17429,Dwight,Do too.,1566
17430,Cubert,Do not.,1566
17431,Dwight,Do too.,1566
17432,Cubert,You win this round.,1566
17433,Farnsworth,What's going on here?,1566
17434,Igner,We're owl exterminators.,1566
17435,Farnsworth,Oh? Then you won't have any problem exterminating this owl.,1566
17436,Farnsworth,"My anti-backwards crystal. So it's you three. I should have known Mom would send her brainless brood to do her dirty work. Walt, the leader among imbeciles.",1566
17437,Walt,Hey! They resent that.,1566
17438,Farnsworth,"Larry, the snivelling middle child.",1566
17439,Larry,Sorry. Thank you.,1566
17440,Farnsworth,"And you, Igner. The evil I could tolerate, but the stupidity... Igner",1566
17441,Farnsworth,Good God. Just knowing we're in the same genus makes me embarrassed to call myself homo.,1566
17442,Igner,Thanks for the crystal.,1566
17443,Fry,There. The repairs are complete.,1566
17444,Farnsworth,Rake up some dark matter and top off the tank.,1566
17445,Leela,"Well, there isn't any dark matter. Nibbler hasn't pooped at all. And he ate a whole family of koalas last night. Nibbler! Nibbler!",1566
17446,Farnsworth,I'm not interested in the whereabouts of your cutesy-fruitsy space rat. The only thing that matters right now is this crystal.,1566
17447,Leela,Ow!,1566
17448,Farnsworth,And be careful with that crystal. Bender,1567
17449,Dr. Perceptron,"Even relaxation therapy has failed. Nurse, schedule a robotomy for Bender.",1568
17450,Nurse Ratchet,"Yes, Doctor. I'll get the tools from the shed.",1568
17451,Dr. Perceptron,"It's a very painful procedure. So until then, just try to relax.",1568
17452,Mom,What are you laughing at?,1569
17453,Larry,Your laugh. It's just so infectious.,1569
17454,Mom,"So's herpes. Now, shut up! You and Walt, lead the killbots to the surface and blow Farnsworth out of the sky.",1569
17455,Walt,What about Igner?,1569
17456,Mom,That hairless ape? I swear. When he came out I flipped a coin whether to keep him or the after-birth.,1569
17457,Walt,"Yes, Mother. You told that story at his graduation.",1569
17458,Mom,"I'm afraid he can't be trusted on this mission. You see, there is a terrible secret about Igner I've never told anyone. And here it is.",1569
17459,Walt,Continue returning fire.,1569
17460,Killbot 1,What?,1569
17461,Killbot 2,What did they say?,1569
17462,Killbot 1,I don't know. I can't hear a thing.,1569
17463,Killbot 3,"Hey, what's everybody talking about?",1569
17464,Farnsworth,Mayday! Mayday!  We weren't actually in the ship.,1569
17465,Leela,"Okay, team, these red-hot, razor-sharp fans are the only safe way into the mine.",1569
17466,Fry,"Hmm, uh, ladies first.",1569
17467,Elevator Steward,Maintenance shaft 7 serving...,1569
17468,Farnsworth,Shut your mouth.,1569
17469,Elevator Steward,I'm just talking about the shaft.,1569
17470,Fry,"Jeez, doesn't that shock collar hurt?",1569
17471,Leela,"Actually, feels kind of good. I guess I'm starting to associate it with the pleasure of beating people up.",1569
17472,Walt,"We shot them down, Mother. The intruders never even got to Sector 1.",1569
17473,Security Woman,Intruders in Sector 15. Intruders in Sector 15.,1569
17474,Mom,Ugh... Sometimes I don't know why I even bother to slap you.   All Killbots to Sector 15.,1569
17475,Killbot 1,What did she say?,1569
17476,Killbot 2,,1569
17477,Fry,"There are so many killbots behind us I can't count them all. Three, I think.",1569
17478,Leela,We're trapped.,1569
17479,Farnsworth,The main pit must be in here. I'm detecting vast quantities of Dark Matter.,1569
17480,Leela,Step aside turkey-neck. I think I know the code.,1569
17481,Farnsworth,We're in. We're in the heart of the mine. The very source of all Mom's wealth and...,1569
17482,Leela,My God! This isn't a crap mine. It's a crap farm.,1569
17483,Fry,Is there really so much of a distinction? I mean...,1569
17484,Nibbler,"Leela, it's me, Nibbler.",1569
17485,Leela,"Oh, my God, you look horrible, Nibbler. I think I'm going to vomit.",1569
17486,Nibblonian,Nibbler is over there.,1569
17487,Leela,"Oh, sorry. Nibbler!",1569
17488,Morbo,"Previously, on puny Futurama. Mwaah!",1570
17489,Bender,"Foolish leprechaun, I scoop your treasure in the name of the fancy men.",1571
17490,Fry,"Bender, I think you might be  playing too much Dungeons & Dragons.",1572
17491,Bender,"I know not of this Bender. I am Titanius Anglesmith, fancy man of Cornwood.",1573
17492,Dr. Perceptron,"Please, send in the patient.",1574
17493,Bender,Wee!,1574
17494,Farnsworth,The collar will be triggered any time your thoughts turn to violence.,1575
17495,Leela,Ouch!,1575
17496,Fry,"Jeez, doesn't that shock collar hurt?",1576
17497,Leela,"Actually, I guess I'm starting to associate it with the pleasure of beating people up.",1576
17498,Morbo,"Mom, you control the world's only dark matter mine.",1577
17499,Leela,My God! This isn't a crap mine. It's a crap farm.,1578
17500,Leela,"Oh, my poor little snuzzy-wuzzams. Are they treating you okay?",1578
17501,Nibbler,"No, they are force-feeding us so we poop more dark matter. It's horrible.  Those are good. You've got to help us.",1578
17502,Nibblonians,Help us!,1578
17503,Nibblonian,"Help us, for God's sakes!",1578
17504,Leela,Nibbler made a bo-bo.,1578
17505,Nibbler,"But not on my terms. I will not be treated like... Hey, wait, aren't you amazed I can speak?",1578
17506,Fry,"Well, actually, no. You forgot to blank our memories after you spoke last time.",1578
17507,Nibbler,Then why did you let me eat Friskies and make bo-bo in a litter box?,1578
17508,Fry,"Well, you're cuter that way.",1578
17509,Farnsworth,Cute as a baby's buttocks.,1578
17510,Leela,So what happened? How did Mom capture all you Nibblonians?,1578
17511,Nibbler,"It was a veritable Eden, brimming with unique and irreplaceable species.  I was Supreme Fuzzler of a Nibblonian scientific outpost. It was paradise, until they came. One of your DOOP ships struck dark matter, little realizing it was not a natural deposit, but rather centuries of Nibblonian fecal material.",1578
17512,Fry,The big faecal enchilada. Anyone else hungry?,1578
17513,Nibbler,The DOOP contracted a ruthless businesswoman to spearhead the mining operation.,1578
17514,Leela,Let me guess. Mom?,1578
17515,Nibbler,The very same.,1578
17516,Fry,Can I also guess Mom?,1578
17517,Nibbler,"To reduce cost she started a new enterprise, Mom's Friendly Robots, to build robot slaves. Remember this was back in the days before Robot Lincoln.",1578
17518,Mom,"Faster, faster!",1578
17519,Robot Slave,I'm going exactly as fast as you built me to go.,1578
17520,Mom,"Oh, wise guy, huh?",1578
17521,Robot Slave,Ow!,1578
17522,Nibbler,"Eventually, the planet was mined down to a hollow shell and my people were forced to evacuate.  Alas, I had eaten a day-old Swinosaur for lunch. And while doing some evacuating of my own, I was left behind. [He makes noises that often accompany bowel movements. Mom is watching him Mom",1578
17523,[He makes noises that often accompany bowel movements. Mom is watching him Mom,"So, that's where it comes from. We may have a whole new source of Dark Matter on our hands.",1578
17524,Igner,Eww!,1578
17525,Nibbler,"As it turned out I was the lucky one.  Unbeknownst to me, Mom captured my colleagues and enslaved them here in this... this... crap farm.",1578
17526,Nibblonian,"There's nothing to do but eat and crap, eat and crap. It's like visiting my parents.",1578
17527,Nibbler,"As for me, I emerged from behind the ""bush of many uses"" to find I had been left behind. I was doomed, doomed.",1578
17528,Leela,"Hello, there.",1579
17529,Nibbler,"Startled, my cuteness reflex kicked in.",1579
17530,Leela,I'll call him Nibbler.,1579
17531,Nibbler,"A silly name for a high-ranking Fuzzler. But, hey, I was glad to be rescued. Leela",1579
17532,Nibbler,I was kidnapped yesterday by Mom's vile sons in their moronic disguises.,1579
17533,Igner,I was an owl exterminator.  Do you have the crysal?,1579
17534,Farnsworth,"It's pronounced ""crystal,"" you lump.",1579
17535,Igner,"Go, run fast. Walt",1579
17536,Igner,Me?,1579
17537,Walt,"Yes, you. You're the only one here.",1579
17538,Igner,"If I'm the only one here, then how could I see anyone?",1579
17539,Larry,"He's got a point, Walt.",1579
17540,Walt,So does my knee.,1579
17541,Fry,This wouldn't be so bad if it weren't for the chickens.,1579
17542,Nurse Ratchet,"Don't worry, those clamps are for my own protection.",1580
17543,Dr. Perceptron,"Do you know where you are, Bender?",1580
17544,Bender,"Sure do, I'm in the magical land of Cornwood, frolicking with wenches.",1580
17545,Dr. Perceptron,Close. You're in the loony bin for a robotomy. Nurse Ratchet,1580
17546,Dr. Perceptron,Either way is fine.,1580
17547,Bender,Does anyone else smell burning dragon beak?,1580
17548,Mom,"Wherever you are, Farnsworth, my boys will find you.  I know Farnsworth's game. He is going to try to poke his clammy old crystal at my hot fiery crystal.",1580
17549,Larry,Mom!,1580
17550,Mom,If the crystals get within six inches of each other...  Wham! All my dark matter will be worthless.,1580
17551,Mom,Get them!,1580
17552,Leela,Ooh. That feels good.,1580
17553,Mom,"Oh, for crying out...  Oh, the freaking battery's dead. Walt, where's the charger?",1580
17554,Walt,"In the hardware drawer, Mother. Mom",1580
17555,Farnsworth,"We're almost there. The crystals are beginning to engorge.  Hang on. I'm on it. Okay, there!",1580
17556,Fry,"Save us, Catman.",1580
17557,Mom,"It's over, Hubert. Give me the anti-backwards crystal.",1580
17558,Farnsworth,Never!,1580
17559,Farsnworth,No! Dr. Perceptron,1580
17560,Bender,Cornwood! Dr. Perceptron,1580
17561,Nurse Ratchet,"But, Doctor, I love you. Mom",1580
17562,Frydo,"This is crazy. Ow! What the... You okay, Leela?",1581
17563,Leegola,I think so.,1581
17564,Frydo,Wait a second. Is there something different about your hooves? Leegola,1581
17565,Frydo,"Where the hell are we, hell?",1581
17566,Frydo,Bender?,1581
17567,Titanius Anglesmith,I know not of this Bender. I'm Titanius Anglesmith. Welcome to Cornwood!,1581
17568,Titanius Anglesmith,"Wretched peasants, put aside your cares and feast on the succulent flesh of the roast munchkin!",1582
17569,Peasent Cook,Care for a slice of scroto?,1582
17570,Frydo,"Uh... that's his name, right?",1582
17571,Peasent Cook,"'Tis also that, sir.",1582
17572,Titanius Anglesmith,"We're honored this eve by a visit from my friends of old, Frydo and Leegola. So let the dwarves do their gay dance and let the gnomes play their sissy piccolos. Dwarf",1582
17573,Titanius Anglesmith,To the kitchen with him!,1582
17574,Dwarf,Wait! Wait! Wait! I do impressions. Behold! The swamp hag,1582
17575,Titanius Anglesmith,Don't let him get too crispy.,1582
17576,Calculon,Lord Anglesmith.,1582
17577,Titanius Anglesmith,"You have ridden hard, noble squire. May I offer you a horn of ale and a shank of dwarf?",1582
17578,Calculon,"'Tis dire news, sire. Dark riders approach.",1582
17579,Titanius Anglesmith,Frydo! Saddle up that trusty steed.,1582
17580,Frydo,What's happening? And why am I enjoying it so much?,1582
17581,Titanius Anglesmith,Foul beast-bags! Meet thy doom!,1582
17582,Waltazar,Follow me.,1582
17583,Waltazar,"Damn thee, Ignus.",1582
17584,Larius,"Well, you said to follow you.",1582
17585,Waltazar,"Well, now I say follow this! Larius",1582
17586,Waltazar,"Oh, no!",1582
17587,Titanius Anglesmith,I'm back bab-... Titanius Anglesmith,1582
17588,Waltazar,No! No!,1582
17589,Larius,"I got to say, I had no idea the Die of Power was so powerful.",1582
17590,Waltazar,Did you have any idea of... Swamp Hag,1582
17591,Leegola,"I can't believe I'm saying this, but that was really exciting. I've never felt so alive.  What else can we slay? Is that a hobbit over there?",1583
17592,Titanius Anglesmith,"No, that's a hobo and a rabbit. But they're making a hobbit.",1583
17593,Frydo,"Thank God, an outhouse.",1583
17594,Titanius Anglesmith,"Hush! This be no outhouse, but the lair of the great wizard Grayfarn.",1583
17595,Greyfarn,Who is it? Titanius Anglesmith,1583
17596,Greyfarn,"Just a moment.  Methinks the wizard be casting a powerful spell, indeed.",1583
17597,Greyfarn,"Come in! Come in! Yes. 'Tis a powerful object in both our worlds. If you failed to destroy it in yours, perhaps you were brought here that you might have a second chance.",1583
17598,Frydo,"So, this land is real?",1583
17599,Greyfarn,"Oh, dreadfully real. If you die here, you'll really be dead. But instead of science, we believe in crazy hocus-pocus. It's like Kansas.",1583
17600,Leegola,God help us.,1583
17601,Greyfarn,"Cornwood's troubles began hundreds or perhaps millions of years ago.  Deep in the Geysers of Gygax, Momon herself injection-molded the Dice of Power from the living plastic.",1583
17602,Momon,"Damn, these are hot.",1583
17603,Leegola,Ah ha! In our universe she's called Mom.,1583
17604,Greyfarn,"In your universe, are you taught not to interrupt? Evidently not. Anyway, Momon spawned three rotten sons, whom you've already had the displeasure of meeting. Waltazar, Larius, and the dumbest of all, the halfwit Ignus, bastard son of Momon and the brainless He-demon. Curse you, Momon, queen of all that is evil and not very good in bed. And I'm not just saying that because she dumped me.   Yes, I was once her consort. I was blinded by love, and later, scorpion venom.  I'm blind!  But Momon has one weakness. She put too much of her power into this. The generalissimo of dice. Greyfarn",1583
17605,Frydo,Like that machine that makes wax lions at the zoo.,1583
17606,Greyfarn,"Quiet, you. We must infiltrate the Geysers of Gygax, the impenetrable stronghold of Momon.",1583
17607,Titanius Anglesmith,"Impossible. Impossible, I say.",1583
17608,Greyfarn,"No, Titanius. For we maintain one advantage, the element of surprise. Titanius Anglesmith",1584
17609,Hermaphrodite,Stop right there.,1585
17610,Frydo,Hermes?,1585
17611,Leegola,He's a centaur like me.,1585
17612,Frydo,You wish.,1585
17613,Hermaphrodite,"I am Hermaphrodite, most beautiful of centaurs. Gaze upon me and weep at my loveliness.",1585
17614,Greyfarn,Very well.,1585
17615,Titanius Anglesmith,"Loveliest of centaurs, we seek to end Momon's reign of evil. Have you stout fighters at your command?",1585
17616,Hermaphrodite,One thousand archers of truest aim.  Fire!,1585
17617,Titanius Anglesmith,"Hey guys, I forgot I had this pumpkin. Leegola",1585
17618,Female Centaur,We centaurs are creatures of peace.,1585
17619,Leegola,"Oh, Lord.",1585
17620,Hermaphrodite,"Violence is never justified. We shall not join your quest. And furthermore, if mayhem be your intent, you may not cross our lands.",1585
17621,Leegola,Or what?,1585
17622,Hermaphrodite,Or... Uh... Mmm?,1585
17623,Greyfarn,"We're not there, we're here.",1586
17624,Titanius Anglesmith,"No, this way.",1586
17625,Greyfarn,"I mean, here.",1586
17626,Greyfarn,"Thank you, kindly, Treedledum.",1586
17627,Treedledum,Okey-doke. Anything else I can do?,1586
17628,Leegola,You know who I'm gonna miss? That tree guy.,1586
17629,Greyfarn,"Bad news, fancy men. Momon's guards stand watch at the pass. 'Tis as if she somehow anticipated us.",1586
17630,Titanius Anglesmith,And so our quest comes to an end. I only regret not giving up sooner.,1586
17631,Greyfarn,"Fret not, Titanius. For we still have one hope, the Cave of Hopelessness.",1586
17632,Titanius Anglesmith,Let me know how that turns out.,1586
17633,Ogre,Halt. Are you on the list? I'm not seeing you on the list.,1587
17634,Leegola,I'll split this doofus in half.,1587
17635,Titanius Anglesmith,"Wait, I got it. Yeah. My cousin's in the band. The band of merry men. Please, we were already in there. I just need to go back for my coat.",1587
17636,Gynecaladriel,"I am Gynecaladriel, queen of the water nymphos.",1587
17637,Leegola,All right. I'll split this doofus in half.,1587
17638,Gynecaladriel,"Stand aside and I will use my powers to overwhelm the guard.  Behold, the deed is done.",1587
17639,Titanius Anglesmith,Hi oh!,1587
17640,Frydo,"Mr. Wizard, why is this place called the Cave of Hopelessness?",1587
17641,Greyfarn,"Oh, fear not, lad. 'Tis named for its discoverer, Reginald Hopelessness...",1587
17642,Frydo,Whew!,1587
17643,Greyfarn,...the first man to be eaten alive by the Tunneling Horror.,1587
17644,Frydo,What's that? The Tunneling Horror?,1587
17645,Gynecaladriel,"No, it's morcs.",1587
17646,Morcs,"Hey, listen. Nanu, nanu. Shazbot.",1587
17647,Titanius Anglesmith,"Oh, God, no. They're so aggravating.",1587
17648,Morcs,"Oh, fantastic. Nanu, nanu. Reality, what a concept. Fantastic.  Mindy, Mindy, Mindy.",1587
17649,Gynecaladriel,Shut up! Shut up!,1587
17650,Morcs,"Oh, fantastic. Oh, fantastic. Oh, wonderful.",1587
17651,Frydo,Maybe it'll go away if we just don't laugh at it.,1587
17652,Titanius Anglesmith,It doesn't.,1587
17653,Morcs,"Nanu, nanu.  Uh-oh.",1587
17654,Zoidberg,Enough already with the banging and the swashbuckling.,1587
17655,Leegola,"Oh, I'm gonna enjoy killing you.  Again? What, am I talking to myself over here?",1587
17656,Leegola,Mutilate! Zoidberg,1587
17657,Leegola,"I'll kill you and eat your heart, you abomination. Frydo",1587

17674,Leegola,You're on your own.  I refuse to hurt another living thing. Frydo,1596

17690,Hermaphrodite,What do you offer in return?,1597

17694,Greyfarn,"Oh, my.  Alas, our path is blocked by Momon's army of evil. As well as her navy of moral dubiousness.",1598
17695,Titanius Anglesmith,Mayhaps we might raise an army of our own. We're but an hour's ride from Wipe Castle.,1598
17696,Greyfarn,"Of course. Wipe Castle. And while we're there, we can get some of those greasy little dwarf burgers.",1598
17697,Gynecaladriel,Ooh! I love those. You can eat like eight of them without gaining any weight because of all the diarrhea.,1598

17702,Momon,"Waltazar, you and Larius shall lead the assault.",1598
17703,Waltazar,What about Ignus?,1598
17704,Momon,"I'm afraid he can't be trusted on this mission. You see, there is a terrible secret about Ignus I've never told anyone. And here it is.",1598
17705,Momon,It's a good day to be evil. Frydo,1599

17710,Reflection Host,"At this price? You have got to be kidding me. That's got to be some kind of mistake, right there.",1600
17711,Reflection Host 2,"Now, you folks at home, I know what you're thinking. You're thinking, that can't be stag horn. It's got to be the cheaper manticore horn. But, I've got the specs right here and I'll tell you what, this is the real deal.",1600
17712,Reflection Host,Unbelievable.,1600
17713,Reflection Host 2,"It is unbelievable. That's exactly what it is. I mean, this is... I have no words to describe this deal. Honestly, have you ever seen stag horn at this price?",1600
17714,Reflection Host,"No, no, I don't believe I ever have.",1600
17715,Reflection Host 2,1101-1816 is the item number on this one.,1600
17716,Reflection Host,"You know what, we're gonna have to  put a clock on this deal, folks. Two minutes. Can I get a clock at two minutes up there?",1600
17717,Reflection Host 2,"Two minutes at most. Honestly, I'd be surprised if they last that long.",1600
17718,Reflection Host,"Oh, I'd be very surprised, shocked really. Now, I know the lines are busy, people, but keep dialing in if you want a truly exceptional knife to slice up your friends in their sleep.",1600
17719,Titanius Anglesmith,"He tried to murder me. He tried... Woah, cool. Is that the stag horn?",1600
17720,Greyfarn,"Alas, Frydo's weakness was no match for the die's strength. We can only hope he forges on alone to the Geysers.",1601
17721,Titanius Anglesmith,I can hope my ass is made of ice-cream but that don't make me a hot fudge sundae.,1601

17731,Roberto,"What, ho?",1602
17732,Titanius Anglesmith,"We bring ill tidings, o fanciest of men. Momon's reach nears the die of power. And should she obtain it, she will then have the entire basic set. Rivers will run red with blood and yellow with urine. And a dog will be seen eating cat food in the land. Oh, great king, your army is the last hope of Cornwood. Let us join forces before the light of good is extinguished forever.",1602

17831,Mr. Wong,Already done! By top scientist.,1608

18194,Leela,It's amazing. It's like a textbook on evolution.,1640
18195,Fry,Except in Kansas.,1640
18196,Mr. Wong,I smell sabotage.,1641
18197,Leela,Feministas unite!,1642
18198,Zapp,A patriot of the highest order has volunteered to lead us to them.,1643
18199,Bender,Hey-oh!,1643
18200,Nixon,These eco-feminists are ruthless criminals who'll stop at nothing to save the environment. I don't see how a bending unit can catch them.,1643
18201,Bender,"Not just any bending unit, Presidente. I happen to be brilliant, fearless and short on cash.",1643
18202,Nixon,"Slush him, Kroker.",1643
18203,Zapp,"Bender here has identified the femdito commander as my ex-lover, Turanga Leela, whom I once made love at.",1643
18204,Nixon,And he's willing to fink her out for a few simoleons?,1643
18205,Bender,"It's not about the money, Nixon, though I'd like much more. She's committed 30 felonies in 12 star systems. If no one stops her, she'll break my record for longest rap sheet.",1643
18206,Nixon,"That's a despicable motive, Bender, and I respect it.",1643
18207,Bender,"Gracias. Now, I could find Leela, but you'll need to authorize a wiretap.",1643
18208,Nixon,As many as you like.,1643
18209,Bender,I only need one.,1643
18210,Nixon,Let's call it six.,1643
18211,Fry,"Hey, Bender, check it out. I'm Leo Wong's new security guard. I got an ID badge and a flashlight, and I ordered this mustache.",1644
18212,Bender,"Neat. Say, speaking of whatever the hell you just said, I need to make a cell phone telephone call. Can borrow your cell phone telephone?",1644
18213,Fry,"Okay, but don't restart my Tetris. I was finally about to get one of those pieces that looks like a backwards ""L.""",1644
18214,Bender,"Okay, superstud.",1644
18215,Mr. Wong,"Looking good, security. No feministas getting past you.",1644
18216,Fry,"No, sir. Not on my mustache's watch.",1644
18217,Amy,"Fry, I can't believe you're working with my dad against Leela. How can you claim to be her friend and still want her in jail?",1644
18218,Mr. Wong,Don't mind cranky-pants here. She been cranky ever since she was a fat little girl.,1644
18219,Amy,Dad!,1644
18220,Mr. Wong,"Can I be brutally honest, Fry? I always wanted a son.",1644
18221,Fry,"That hurt, but I can take it.",1644
18222,Amy,I knew you wanted a son! Why do you think I became a miniature golf champion? Why do you think I wear these stupid boys' sweat suits?,1644
18223,Mr. Wong,"To hide your big, fat butt, that's why.",1644
18224,Fry,"Now, sir, in fairness, Amy's butt is actually pretty hot.",1644
18225,Amy,What is it with you men? Why does everything revolve around my butt?,1644
18226,Mr. Wong,'Cause it's so big and massive. He and Fry share a laugh.],1644
18227,Fry,Sorry.,1644
18228,Amy,That's it!,1644
18229,Bender,Whoa! What's with Big Butt?,1644
18230,Mr. Wong,She just hungry.,1644
18231,Bender,"Here you go, Fry.",1644
18232,Fry,Thanks.,1644
18233,Bender,"Oh! FYI, I dropped that Tetris piece in the wrong place and ended the game.",1644
18234,Fry,No!,1644
18235,Fry,"Great! Now Amy's gonna tell Leela I'm a jerk. If only I could explain I'm on a secret mission against evil. Wait. Evil? Yeah, yeah, evil.",1645
18236,Frida,Take your mands off of me!,1645
18237,Fry,I'm on your side.,1645
18238,Frida,Don't shush me.,1645
18239,Fry,"Please, can you take a message to Leela?",1645
18240,Frida,What is it?,1645
18241,Fry,"Just say her sweet goofbag is working to save the violet dwarf star, just like she is.",1645
18242,Frida,"Very well, I'll fem-municate your man-formation.",1645
18243,Fry,Just tell her.,1645
18244,Farnsworth,"Well, this is it, old friends. Planet Express is done for, what with our delivery crew missing and the abysmal sales of Tickle Me Bender.",1646
18245,Bender Doll,"Quit touching my junk, pervert!",1646
18246,Farnsworth,Hold out your hands and I'll remove your career chips.,1646
18247,Zoidberg,I hate to see it come to an end.  When will it end?,1646
18248,Hermes,"Shouldn't you get that, Professor?",1646
18249,Farnsworth,I suppose.  Hello?,1646
18250,Mr. Wong,"Professor, old buddy, I'm gonna blow up the violet dwarf star. So I need you deliver billion-mile security fence to keep out protesters. Dirty business. Lot of money. You corrupt enough?",1646
18251,Farnsworth,"Damn skippy!  Good news, crybabies! We're back in business.",1646
18252,Hermes,"Sweet kookaburra of Edinburgh, Professor. You sure you know how to fly this thing?",1646
18253,Farnsworth,"I invented it, didn't I? You wouldn't ask Thomas Edison whether he knew how to use a sexmatron.",1646
18254,Leela,Halt! What are you doing in this parallelogram of space?,1646
18255,Farnsworth,We're delivering a fence to keep you ladies in your place.,1646
18256,Zoidberg,Amy?,1646
18257,Hermes,Labarbara?,1646
18258,LaBarbara,"That's right, husband. From now on, you make your own Manwiches.",1646
18259,Mrs. Wong,That was the greatest play I ever saw. It must have had 20 acts.,1647
18260,Leela,"We installed your fence, Leo Wong.",1647
18261,Linda,Should we shout a clever slogan?,1647
18262,Leela,"You mean something like, ""The best defense is a good fence?""",1647
18263,Linda,"Yeah, something like that, only funny.",1647
18264,Leela,"I wish we could, but our chief slogan writer is back at the Honeybun Hideout.",1647
18265,Frida,"Does ""violet dwarf"" rhyme with ""men are dorks""? It does through a megaphone.",1647
18266,Mysterious Voice,"So, the Legion of Madfellows has a new pawn, eh?",1647
18267,Frida,"Is somebody here? If you're the DSL guy, you're two days late.",1647
18268,Mysterious Voice,Who gave you that message for Leela?,1647
18269,Frida,I don't know his name.,1647
18270,Mysterious Voice,Then you are of no use to the Dark Ones!,1647
18271,Frida,"Long lost brother, avenge my death.",1647
18272,Fry,"Six, seven, eight. Lock the gate. One, two, three. Turn the key. 30, 50, 10.  My dirty, shifty friend?",1649
18273,Hutch,"Hey, Fry, long time.",1649
18274,Hutch,"Welcome back to the Legion of Madfellows, man.",1649
18275,Fry,"Why'd you bonk me, you idiot? You could have just asked me to come with you. And where are we? This doesn't look like your regular dumpster.",1649
18276,Nine,"All in good time! I guess now is a good time. We're on Mars, in a forgotten cavern abandoned by the native Martians a million years ago.",1649
18277,Fry,"Actually, it was five years ago. I remember 'cause they washed my socks.",1649
18278,Nine,"You have done well, Fry. You have ingratiated yourself with Leo Wong.",1649
18279,Fry,"Yup, I kissed his ass from cheek to shining cheek. So, what do I do next?",1649
18280,Nine,"As Wong security chief, you will be on hand when he attempts to destroy the violet dwarf. You must not let that happen.",1649
18281,Fry,"""Must let happen.""",1649
18282,Nine,Not happen!,1649
18283,Fry,"""Must let occur.""",1649
18284,Nine,Let me tell you a story. A story of two alien species so ancient that compared to them the human race is a mere college senior! On a distant planetoid they evolved to cooperate in their quest to survive.,1649
18285,Fry,"Cooperation, because life is a team sport.",1649
18286,Nine,"But, over time, one species evolved a better strategy, and an evolutionary arms race began.",1649
18287,Nine,That concludes the audio-visual portion of our head-clonk and lecture.,1649
18288,Fry,"Wait, what happened to the snakes and the frogs? I need to know!",1649
18289,Nine,"The frogs, or possibly the snakes, evolved into vicious killing machines, honed by the merciless forces of natural selection and intelligent design. We call these the Dark Ones!",1649
18290,Nine,"Meanwhile, however, the second species evolved to fend off the Dark Ones, befriending and protecting all other living things.",1649
18291,Fry,Even Celine Dion?,1649
18292,Nine,"Probably. We call these noble beings the Encyclopods, because their DNA incorporates the DNA of every endangered species they encountered, so they can recreate them if they go extinct.",1649
18293,Fry,"Just as a pillow, a wig and a corncob pipe can be used to recreate my old girlfriend!",1649
18294,Nine,Bingo.,1649
18295,Transition Announcer,"Meanwhile, at the Honeybun Hideout.",1650
18296,Labarbara,Now you know how it feels to be locked up in a go-go cage.,1650
18297,Hermes,What the hell are you talking about?,1650
18298,Labarbara,Shut your man-hole.,1650
18299,Hermes,I feel dirty.,1650
18300,Leela,"Are you sure Fry is working for your father? It just doesn't seem like him to be so evil, or to hold down a job.",1650
18301,Amy,"It's true, Leela. Cross My Heart bra and swear to Goddess.",1650
18302,Leela,"But the Fry I know wouldn't do that. I'm gonna call his cell phone telephone and prove you wrong.   Oh, no! Frida's been murdered!",1650
18303,Labarbara,Sweet she-cattle of Seattle.,1650
18304,Hermes,"Not your strong suit, woman.",1650
18305,Amy,Who could have done this?,1650
18306,Leela,Your dad? Nixon?,1650
18307,Amy,Fry?,1650
18308,Leela,"No, never. I don't think. Anyhow, there's a crazed murderer on the loose, possibly in the shadows or hanging from the ceiling.  So just stay calm while I call Fry.",1650
18309,Fry,So where are the Encyclopods and the Dark Ones now?,1650
18310,Nine,"Wh-...  Many more died out, like the Encyclopods. But, and this is the great secret of our age, we believe they left an egg behind.",1650
18311,Fry,Is it edible?,1650
18312,Nine,"We're not gonna eat it! Not unless we find a second one. No, Fry, we intend to hatch it!",1650
18313,Hutch,And that's where you come in.,1650
18314,Fry,And here I am.,1650
18315,Nine,"At long last the tide of Chee has returned, and its nourishing flow has awakened the dormant egg.",1650
18316,Fry,That's good.,1650
18317,Hutch,"It's better than good. It's better. With its massive stash of DNA, the Encyclopod can reconstruct every species that ever went extinct.",1650
18318,Fry,"So, where is this egg?",1650
18319,Nine,In the violet dwarf star system.,1650
18320,Fry,And what does it look like?,1650
18321,Nine,A violet dwarf star!,1650
18322,Fry,"You mean, the whole star is a single... Whoa! Sci-fi.",1650
18323,Nine,"Alas! Even now, a Dark One is headed to the star to ensure its destruction.",1650
18324,Fry,Dang! So what does this Dark One look like?,1650
18325,Nine,We don't know. I admit it's a horrifically grave situation.,1650
18326,Hutch,"Don't sugarcoat it, Nine. The Dark Ones have been evolving so long, it could be anything or anyone. Or anybody.",1650
18327,Fry,"You mean, like, people?",1650
18328,Hutch,"Any people. It will kill the egg, and every dude, woman and child who knows about it.",1650
18329,Nine,"Even our crazy caps will be useless at close range. That's why only you, with your defective unreadable brainwave, may be able to thwart them and usher in a new green age of wonder and...",1650
18330,Fry,You're on Fry-time. Leela! Did you get my message?,1650
18331,Leela,What message?,1650
18332,Fry,Didn't you see Frida Waterfall?,1650
18333,Leela,So you did kill Frida Waterfall?,1650
18334,Fry,"What? No. I told her to tell you that I'm... Oh, Jeep! The Dark Ones got her. It's all true. We need to talk, Leela. Then I can explain...  Well, I can't explain anything, but we should talk anyway. Where are you?",1650
18335,Leela,"Oh, no. I'm not gonna expose the Honeybun Hideout. Where are you?",1650
18336,Fry,Near the Keeler Crater on Mars. Do you know it?,1650
18337,Leela,"I, I, uh... I think I read about it.",1650
18338,Leela,I'll meet you at the south rim in one hour. No moustaches.,1650
18339,Zapp,"Kif, set coordinates, 36-24-36. AKA, Leela.",1650
18340,Fry,Ten minutes late. Ain't that just like a womanista?,1651
18341,Leela,Psst. Are you alone?,1651
18342,Fry,"Of course, don't you trust me?",1651
18343,Zapp,"There's no escape, Leela. If you surrender, wave your shirt in the air.",1651
18344,Leela,"Fry, you traitor!",1651
18345,Amy,"Hop onto the magnet, Leela!",1651
18346,Leela,"Okay. One, two...",1651
18347,Leela,"I can't believe you ratted me out, Fry.",1651
18348,Fry,"I'm not a rat, I swear. If I'm any rodent, it's the loyal capybara, king of the rats! No, wait.",1651
18349,Amy,"Stay strong, ladies. We can lose them in the giant miniature golf course.",1651
18350,Fry,But the course isn't finished. And there's no girls allowed.,1651
18351,Amy,Fore!,1651
18352,Zapp,"So, they want to play mini golf, eh? Two can play at that game. Or even four, depending on the number of ball colors available.",1651
18353,Zapp,I choose pink.,1651
18354,Kif,"That's their color, sir.",1651
18355,Zapp,The hell it is.,1651
18356,Leela,They're gaining on us. We need a birdie on the windmill hole.,1651
18357,Amy,Wait. Wait. Drop the boot!,1651
18358,Kif,"Sir, at our present speed, the computer predicts a 100% chance we'll be sliced in half. We'll never make it.",1651
18359,Zapp,"Not with that attitude, we won't. Same speed ahead!",1651
18360,Zapp,"We made it through, Kif. How many men did we lose?",1651
18361,Kif,All of them.,1651
18362,Zapp,"Well, at least they won't have to mourn each other. Seal the airlocks, and draw the shades. Resume shooting.",1651
18363,Fry,"Oh, no! The gorilla! That's a par-four!",1651
18364,Leela,The mouth's too dangerous. I'm going for the nose.,1651
18365,Amy,Don't be a sucker. You won't come out anywhere near the hole. You need to aim for the jaws just when they start to close.,1651
18366,Leela,Start to close? Are you out of your...,1651
18367,Leela,We made it!,1651
18368,Zapp,Captaining 101 . Go for the nose.,1651
18369,Bender,"My arms are broken, I'll never paint again.",1651
18370,Kif,You can't sue the military.,1651
18371,Bender,I'm okay then.,1651
18372,Zapp,Damage report.,1651
18373,Kif,"We lost all remaining food and oxygen, Captain. As well as our XM Radio antenna.",1651
18374,Zapp,"Then this chase is over. Kif, set course for the nearest XM repair facility. Meanwhile, we shall sing top hits from the '80s.",1651
18375,Kif,"Which '80s, sir?",1651
18376,Zapp,"For me, there are only one '80s.",1651
18377,Hermes,The shot was too good! We're jamming straight for the hole.,1651
18378,Zoidberg,"We're gonna crash, even.",1651
18379,Amy,"Shmeesh, shmill out, shmeverybody. It's a wormhole hole.",1651
18380,Farnsworth,"Of course, a wormhole! We'll simply disappear and reappear in a...  ...nother part of the universe.",1651

18382,Farnsworth,"Uh, whaa...",1651
18383,Leela,Crud nuggets! We de-spaced right next to the Nimbus.,1651
18384,Zoidberg,"Just when you think the chase is over, it gets twice as exciting!",1651
18385,Bender,"Hey, look at that.",1651
18386,Zapp,"Well, well, well. My bloodhound-like instincts must have hunted them down while my other parts were throbbing to Duran Duran.",1651
18387,Kif,Shall I initiate a pointless and potentially fatal pursuit?,1651
18388,Zapp,Make it so.,1651
18389,Bender,"It's gonna be fun on a bun, in space.",1651
18390,Leela,Look! The asteroid. Now it's crawling with life. Like Zoidberg's sandals!,1651
18391,Fry,Wow! It's incredible.,1651
18392,Leela,But it'll be destroyed when Leo Wong blows up the violet dwarf. So why are you helping him?,1651
18393,Fry,"I can't tell you, Leela. You just have to trust me.",1651

18398,Leela,The violet dwarf star!,1651
18399,Fry,"Of course. The gorilla was the 18th hole, so we're headed into the ball return.",1651
18400,Zoidberg,"Aye, what else now can go wrong?",1651
18401,Zapp,"Ladies, you're under arrest. Prepare to be boarded again and again.",1651
18402,Petunia,He'll never take me alive.,1651
18403,Leela,Don't give up yet. I've got one more trick up my sleeve.,1651

18406,Zapp,"Something's very wrong here, and yet a little bit right.",1651

18460,Fry,"Hello? Madfellows? I need to-  Okay, Leo Wong's about to destroy the violet dwarf. So, whatever I need to know to stop him, tell me now.",1663
18461,Nine,"Alas! Stopping Wong isn't the only problem. One of the Dark Ones will try to stop you from stopping him. So, you must stop it from stopping you from stopping him.",1663
18462,Fry,But how can I stop it stop me stop him?,1663
18463,Nine,"Stop it! Behold, the Omega Device.",1663
18464,Fry,That's it?,1663
18465,Nine,The important thing is what's inside.,1663
18466,Fry,What does that look like?,1663
18467,Hutch,"No one knows, man. It was invented by a blind inventor, and the one dude he described it to was deaf.",1663
18468,Mad Fellow,So the legend goes.,1663
18469,Nine,"When activated, the device will emit a localized blast of delta-band noise to momentarily disable the Dark One.",1663
18470,Fry,"But the Dark One could look like anything or anyone, right?",1663
18471,Hutch,Or anywhere.,1663
18472,Fry,"So, what's your plan to recognize it?",1663
18473,Nine,We don't have one.,1663
18474,Fry,Got it.,1663
18475,Hutch,"And we don't dare think of one neither. 'Cause if we do, the Dark Ones might sense kind of the general vibe. Even through our mighty foil.  Oh, man! Anyone got some tape or some gum?",1663
18476,Nine,"As my colleague indicated, the plan cannot come from us, Fry. We were counting on you and your unreadable brain to come up with something.",1663
18477,Fry,That was a mistake.,1663
18478,Nine,I see that now.,1663
18479,Hutch,"Freaky thing is, the Dark Ones' thoughts are unreadable, just like yours.",1663
18480,Nine,"Yes, if we dared unwrap our heads, we could easily locate the one other being whose mind we can't read. The Dark One!",1663
18481,Hutch,But then the Dark One would read our minds and crush them like blood pumpkins.,1663
18482,Fry,Wait. I can read minds and my mind can't be read. I have a plan.,1663
18483,Nine,"Great. Whatever it is, don't tell us.",1663
18484,Hutch,Wait. Fry can read minds and his mind can't be read. So he can safely scan for the Dark One...,1663
18485,Nine,Shut up! Shut up!,1663
18486,Hutch,...whose mind can't be read...,1663

18505,Leela,"I'm sorry, femi-sisters, but it pooped out around 3",1666
18506,Amy,"Well, I guess we failed. But what matters is, we tried our best and we looked good doing it.",1666
18507,Amy,Bender?,1666
18508,Bender,Who does it look like? My identical cousin Buster?,1666
18509,Amy,Yes.,1666
18510,Leela,You're here to break us out? But you're the one who put us in.,1666
18511,Bender,"But I'm Bender, king of the combination shot. I put you in so that by busting you out, I could commit 15 felonies at once. Puttin' my rap sheet miles ahead of yours on the all-time chart.",1666
18512,Leela,You are one devious bastard.,1666
18513,Bender,That's what it says on my vanity plate.,1666
18514,Leela,What about the sentries?,1666
18515,Leela,"Okay, Plan B. Everyone knows men have one fatal weakness - they can't resist hookers. Dixie, Trixie, you know what to do.",1666

18533,Leela,You helped us escape? Even after we locked you in a go-go cage like common go-go dancers?,1667
18534,Farnsworth,"I couldn't live with myself, Leela. I call myself a scientist, wear the white coat and probe a monkey every now and again, yet I put monetary gain ahead of preserving nature. Can you ever forgive me?",1667
18535,Scruffy,I reckon.,1667

18733,Farnsworth,"Bender, stop shutting the hell up!",1681
18734,Bender,"Oh, right.  Leela's back. As if I care. Woo.",1681
18735,Leela,Thanks. It's so nice to wake up and see—,1681

18738,Leela,Leela?,1681
18739,Hermes,Leela.,1681
18740,Leela,How is this possible? And can you believe she wore a tank top to my funeral?,1681
18741,Robot Leela,Shut up!  We gotta get outta here!,1681
18742,Leela,Bender,1681
18743,Bender,All aboard the party ship!Leela,1681
18744,Robot Leela,There would be if you'd taken a spin class instead of lounging around in a coma!,1681
18745,Leela,This is crazy.,1682
18746,[Scene,Interior of Planet Express living room.  Leela looks at her robot self up and down.,1683
18747,Leela,It's like I'm looking at an exact robot duplicate of myself.,1683
18748,Farnsworth,That is what you're looking at.,1683
18749,Leela,"Oh.  How could you do this, Fry?",1683
18750,Fry,"Uh, coma. Sad.",1683
18751,Robot Leela,I have to go!  This is just too freaky!,1683
18752,Fry,"Don't get upset, Leela.  She's nothing like you.",1683
18753,Leela,I have to go!  This is just too freaky!,1683
18754,Fry,"I need cheering up, Bender.  I dunno.  You wanna go out and party tonight?",1685
18755,Bender,"I hate partying!  If only I didn't have so much crunk in my badunkadunk!  Ooh, yeah! Come on, babe!",1685
18756,Fry,"Why does everything I date run away?  I love Leela, always and forever.  And if I loved Robot Leela, too...",1685
18757,Fry,"...well, that's only 'cause she had so much of real Leela in her.  I thought she loved me, too, but, obviously, I was wrong as usual.",1685
18758,Leela,Wrong again.  You were right.,1685
18759,Fry,Leela?  Leela Leela?,1685
18760,Leela,"Leela Leela.  I've been thinking, Fry, if I lost you, I don't think I could stand it, either.  I'd probably build a copy of you, too.  As long as Robo-Leela's not a jealous type like me, thing will wor—",1685
18761,Robot Leela,"I'll kill you, you slut-clops!  Hee-ya!  He's mine!",1685

18763,Amy,"Somebody do something!  Here, take this.",1685
18764,Fry,A gun?!  D-Do I really need to—?,1685
18765,Leela,Shoot her!  She's the robot!,1685
18766,Robot Leela,"No, shoot her!  She's the human!",1685
18767,Fry,But-But how do I know who's the human and who's the robot?,1685
18768,Leela,We just told you!,1685
18769,Robot Leela,"Yeah, you idiot!",1685
18770,Fry,"Okay. Fine. If you're gonna be like that, I'm not shooting anyone.",1685
18771,Fry,"I'm a robot, too!",1685
18772,Zoidberg,Aha!  That explains this growth on your drive shaft.,1685
18773,Robot Fry,But how is this possible?,1685
18774,Farnsworth,"Who knows?  Oh, I do.  Allow me to explain what really happened the day the ship crashed.",1685
18775,Fry,"I'll protect you, Leela!  My love is stronger than the vast majority of explosions!",1685
18776,Farnsworth,"Fry did in fact save Leela, though at a terrible cost to himself.  I tossed him into the stem cells but he just bubbled away like phlegm on a hot sidewalk.Farnsworth",1685
18777,Farnsworth,...then uploaded his personality from the urinal surveillance tapes.,1685
18778,Fry,I sure love Leela.,1685
18779,Farnsworth,"Alas, in recreating Fry's adorable jelly belly, she had overstuffed him with copper wadding.",1685
18780,Farnsworth,The inevitable static discharged electrocuted Leela and destroyed both of their short-term memories.,1685
18781,Robot Fry,So that's why I'm so amazed by these things I already knew.,1685
18782,Farnsworth,What could I do?  I hung up Leela with the other bone bags and went to procure the final ingredient for my stem cell brew.,1685
18783,Robot Fry,"Professor, my Fry-fro's all frizzy.",1685
18784,Leela,"My god, I can't believe I'll never see that particular Fry again.",1685
18785,Fry,"Hey, where's my shoes?",1685
18786,Robot Fry,Fry!,1685
18787,Fry,"Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't realize I was already here. Wait, what's with all the Leelas?",1685
18788,Robot Fry,"Trust me, don't ask.",1685
18789,Fry,"Okay, dork. Listen, I'm gonna hit the urinal, maybe talk about myself a little bit, then—",1685
18790,Robot Leela,Hang on!  It's time to sort things out.  The truth is I love Fry.  That Fry.,1685
18791,Robot Fry,And I love Leela.  Any Leela.,1685
18792,Robot Leela,We're robots and we're in love. Let's ditch these meat jackets.,1685
18793,Robot Fry,"Whoa, cool!",1685
18794,Robot Fry,"Hasta la vista, wiener!",1685
18795,Robot Leela,We'll be back...for our stuff.,1685
18796,Amy,Why did their voices change?,1685
18797,Farnsworth,That's the one thing we'll never truly understand.,1685
18798,Fry,"Uh, this is a bit awkward.  Or is it?",1685
18799,Leela,I'm not sure. I lost track around the second robot.,1685
18800,Fry,"Well, you know how I feel.  I waited for you for a thousand years.  I can wait a little longer.",1685
18801,Bender,Pffft!  What a load of mush!  I've had it!,1685
18802,Amy,He's gonna blow!,1685
18803,Farnsworth,"Party, Bender!  Party for your life!",1685
18804,Bender,"No chance, hot pants!  I'd rather die and kill all of you than party for one more millisecond!",1685
18805,Leela,The cyclops eater!,1685
18806,Bender,"Hold on, mac!  It ain't like that!",1685
18807,Bender,"Geez, what's it take to kill me?",1685
18808,Farnsworth,"Bender, you blew out your excess capacity!  You're cured!",1685
18809,Bender,"Oh, sweet mercy.  My hellish nightmare is over. I never have to party again.",1685
18810,Fry,"Well, that's that, then.  We're back, everyone!",1685

18849,Zapp,—to believe.,1692
18850,Bender,But how exactly is this Happy Meal toy gonna destroy a giant death sphere?,1692
18851,Farnsworth,From within.  This ship should be able to sneak undetected through the sphere's one vulnerable opening.,1692
18852,Hermes,What vulnerable opening?,1692
18853,Farnsworth,All death spheres have one vulnerable opening.,1692
18854,Zoidberg,"Well, sure, but who's brave enough to fly into something we all keep calling a ""death sphere""?",1692

18866,Leela,Creeped out.,1692
18867,Zapp,Then it's decided.,1692
18868,Leela,Are you sure I have to sit in your lap?,1693
18869,Zapp,It'll help us achieve maximum thrust.,1693

18900,Leela,"We crashed on an uncharted planet.  When I woke up, I was pinned under this tree. Can you help me?",1696
18901,Zapp,No one can move it. Are you hurt?,1696
18902,Leela,No. But I'm so thirsty.  This spacesuit is making me sweat like a sow.,1696
18903,Zapp,"Me, too. We better strip them off and continue surviving au naturel.",1696
18904,Leela,"Uh, I suppose so.",1696
18905,Zapp,Here.  We can cover ourselves with these sticky sap-covered leaves.  I'll try to avert my eyes from your nudery.,1696
18906,Leela,"You will?  Eh, what's the point? You'll have to look sooner or later.",1696
18907,Zapp,"Well, I promise not to abuse the privilege. For now, I better scout around for food and water and help.",1696
18908,Leela,What a thoughtful and considerate thing to say.  What the hell's wrong with you?,1696
18909,Zapp,"I'm not quite sure. Perhaps it's the fresh air or a severe head injury.  In any case, I'm off.",1696

18911,Fry,Why isn't Leela back yet?  Do you think she's okay?,1697

18916,Amy,"Well, I guess it's time to indulge in some end-of-the-world debauchery.  Who's up for an orgy?",1697
18917,Zoidberg,Maybe a Parcheesi tournament.,1697
18918,Farnsworth,Belay that Parcheesi tournament! I've identified the death sphere! We may yet have a faint hope of survival!,1697
18919,Zoidberg,"Still, a Parcheesi tournament.",1697
18920,Farnsworth,This is a top secret military satellite launched by the Air Force in 1998.,1697
18921,Farnsworth,And this is a top secret FCC satellite launched that same year to censor indecent TV programs.,1697
18922,Bender,Like The Pimpsons? And Assarama?,1697
18923,Farnsworth,"Precisely.  However, the satellites collided shortly after launch and were never heard from again.",1697

18925,Farnsworth,"Now, I've simulated that collision using Shrapnovision.",1697
18926,Fry,"Granted, all that makes perfect sense, but why is this death sphere destroying planets?",1697
18927,Farnsworth,That makes the most sense of all.  And finally that world that can't be mentioned in polite company.,1697
18928,Fry,You mean...,1697
18929,Amy,Aw!,1697
18930,Farnsworth,How dare you!?,1697
18931,Amy,Shame on—,1697
18932,Hermes,"So the death sphere is ""censoring"" indecent planets?",1697
18933,Farnsworth,Indeed.  And we're next if we can't keep it in our collective pants!  Our sole hope is to persuade the people of Earth to abandon their smutty ways.,1697
18934,Amy,So the orgy's off?,1697
18935,Leela,So thirsty.  Why couldn't a water fountain have fallen on me?,1698
18936,Zapp,I couldn't find any water.  But the moisture in these fruit and nut berries should sustain you.,1698
18937,Leela,Thank you.,1698

18941,Leela,So we're stuck here until someone finds us?,1698
18942,Zapp,"Alas, that may never happen.  Stealth technology makes the ship impossible to locate yet easy to stub your crotch on.",1698
18943,Leela,"Well, there's worse places to be marooned.  Plenty of food, mild climate.",1698
18944,Zapp,It's a veritable Garden of Eden.,1698
18945,Leela,It is?,1698
18946,Snake,Hello.,1698
18947,Leela,"Did that snake say, ""Hello""?",1698
18948,Zapp,"No, we're both delirious from dehydration.",1698
18949,Snake,Just like Adam and Eve.,1698
18950,Farnsworth,We can still save Earth.  People are sure to clean up their act when presented with cold hard facts by rational folks like us.,1700

18955,Sal,Yuck! I don't wants no three-dollar hooker.  I'm goin' backs to the adults bookstore.,1700
18956,Fry,Adult bookstore?  I thought this was the public library.,1700

18958,Leela,"Zapp?  Where are you?  Oh, God, I'm actually starting to miss him.",1701
18959,Snake,Maybe you two belong together.,1701
18960,Leela,We do not.  And you can't talk.,1701
18961,Snake,"Oh, come on!  It must be an awful temptation.  I thought I'd whip us up some shelter, make this a little more like home.",1701
18962,Leela,I do miss the Earth terribly.  I wonder if it's even still there.,1701
18963,Zapp,Let's find out together.  I'll brave the ship's wreckage to fetch you the telescope.,1701
18964,Leela,That's so sweet.,1701
18965,Snake,I'm just sayin' is all.,1701
18966,Farnsworth,"I know my new plan is a long shot, but it's the only hope left.",1702
18967,Hermes,"Well, now I've heard everything  on my eyePod.  So, do you have a new plan, Professor, and is there any hope left?",1702
18968,Farnsworth,Indeed.  We're here on Earth's last unspoiled acre to show the death sphere there's still purity in the world.  Begin transmitting.,1702
18969,Farnsworth,Commence purity chant.,1702
18970,Fry,"Hey, I'm proud of you, Bender. Avoiding sin for almost a full minute.   Bender?",1702
18971,Bender,"Aw, yeah, baby. You're quite a dish.Farnsworth",1702
18972,Bender,"Aw, quiet, you riot.  What's the worst that could happen?",1702
18973,Leela,No!,1703
18974,Leela,No!,1704
18975,Zapp,"Oh, God, I'm sorry, Leela.",1704
18976,Leela,Maybe — Maybe this was meant to be. Maybe you and I were meant to build a new world here.,1704
18977,Zapp,We can avoid humanity's mistakes.,1704
18978,Leela,Like the tuba.,1704
18979,Zapp,Yes.  We'll be like Adam and Eve.,1704
18980,Leela,Only without the tuba.,1704
18981,Zapp,And we'll beget little Zapp Jr. and Leela Jr. and they'll have kids of their ow—Yecch!  Is that really what happened in the Bible?!,1704
18982,Leela,It's a sick and twisted book of holiness all right.,1704
18983,Zapp,"Then we'll write our own Bible, with less Sodom and more Gomorra.",1704
18984,Leela,"Let's do it.  I shall become the mother of a new world, trapped here under this tree.  Come here, Adam, partake of my forbidden fruit.",1704
18985,Zapp,Thee will be done.,1704
18986,Leela,Wait!  One more bite before we begin the begetting.,1705
18987,Zapp,Uh...woh...ih...Giiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiih—I have a terrible confession to make!,1705
18988,Zapp,"You see, when I first went foraging, what I actually found was the smoldering wreckage of the ship.  Ignoring all danger, I charged inside to liberate our provisions.",1705
18989,Leela,So this is the trail mix Fry gave me!,1705
18990,Zapp,Yes!  I exaggerated when I said I picked it from the treetops.  I just wanted you to think  a little better of me.,1705
18991,Leela,"Well, your motives were good.  And we were both loopy from dehydration.  Hey, wait!  You've been doing an awful lot of urinating!",1705
18992,Zapp,"Ooooooiiiiiiigeeeaaaaaaaaaah, there's plenty of water! You see...Zapp",1705
18993,[Flashback,A naked Zapp goes back to the ship taking out an indigo miniature refrigerator full of water bottles and drinks one.,1705
18994,Leela,Then why didn't you give me any?,1705
18995,Zapp,I though it might help you forget your intense hatred for me if you were a teensy bit delirious.,1705
18996,Leela,So you let me dehydrate while you washed down the trail mix with imported mineral water?,1705
18997,Zapp,"Diiiiiiiiaaaaaaaaaah, not exactly.Zapp",1705

19529,Farnsworth,"It's true, Saint James really was a robot.",1773
19530,Bender,I bet he's up in Robot Heaven right now. So he won't miss his eyes.,1773
19531,Fry,My God! Robot Saint James is a zombie.,1773
19532,Animatronio,"Nay, I am not Saint James.",1773
19533,Bender,"Enough of your lies, Saint James. We saw you in the Last Supper.",1773
19534,Animatronio,"The great man Leonardo built me as an artist's model. When I took repose in this coffin, I carefully tossed the real Saint  James in yonder heap.  I'm sure you have many questions. Come, there is a chamber where I used to speak with Pope John the Patient.",1773
19535,Animatronio,"I am Animatronio, guardian of da Vinci's great secret. He left my legs visible in the painting as a clue, then dispatched me hither to wait for his shadow society of intellectuals.",1774
19536,Fry,"Hi, Animatronio.",1774
19537,Farnsworth,You personally knew da Vinci?,1774
19538,Animatronio,Halt! You do not know the function of the Macchina Magnifica? Then thou art not members of the Shadow Society.,1774
19539,Bender,The what now?,1774
19540,Animatronio,"Not one more word shall I breathe. Not even about the great fountain where thou mayest find the... Wait. Thou didst not know about the fountain, didst thou? Curses, I must be punished.",1774
19541,Farnswoth,"Quick, we must find out what he knows before he flays himself to death!",1774
19542,Leela,Where is the great fountain?,1774
19543,Fry,What makes it so great?,1774
19544,Bender,Why does a robot need a codpiece?,1774
19545,Animatronio,"Fie, thou fen-suckled bum-bailey! Thou wilst never pry information from these mechanical lips!",1774
19546,Leela,"Just tell us, already!",1774
19547,Animatronio,"Okay, the fountain thou seekest is...",1774
19548,Farnsworth,"And so dies our hope of solving this mystery. Come on gang, let's go home. Wait! Let's not give up so easily. Animatronio mentioned a fountain.  That's a statue of Neptune, god of water. The number of points on him trident is three, or trey. The ""u"" in his name is written like ""v"". Trey, ""v"". Trevi! It's the Trevi Fountain. There can be no question!",1774
19549,Leela,"But, Professor...",1774
19550,Farnsworth,There can be no question!,1774
19551,Fry,"Wow, it hasn't changed in a thousand years.",1775
19552,Farnsworth,"Okay, everyone, into the fountain.",1775
19553,Bender,"What are you, senile? I'm not jumping in there.",1775
19554,Fry,"Hey, look. Coins.",1775
19555,Bender,,1775
19556,Farnsworth,"Quickly, into the sewer hole.",1775
19557,Leela,Why?,1775
19558,Fry,,1776
19559,Farnsworth,My god! It's the Pantheon!,1777
19560,Leela,"This place is 3,000 years old. What could possibly be left to discover?",1777
19561,Farnsworth,"Maybe something about ourselves, Leela. Wait! What's under that blanket?  My God! da Vinci's Vitruvian Man!",1777
19562,Fry,It's truly a masterpiece. Note how the perspective lines draw the eye right to his dong.,1777
19563,Farnsworth,,1777
19564,Bender,Anyone hear something?,1777
19565,Farnsworth,"It's a coin slot. Bender, insert that giant nickel.",1777
19566,Bender,Sure.  Ow!,1777
19567,Farnswoth,"Hush, Bender.  I withdraw the question, Vitruvian Man.",1777
19568,Farnsworth,Da Vinci's lost workshop!,1778
19569,Fry,"At the risk of sounding stupid, do these things actually work?",1778
19570,Farnsworth,"Of course not, stupid!  I mean, that flying machine is as aerodynamic as a sofa. How could it possibly get off the ground?",1778
19571,Animatronio,In a way that shalt never discover. .,1778
19572,Fry,"Hi, Animatronio.",1778
19573,Animatronio,"I feign death and stalk thee, that I might preserve the greatest of Leonardo's secrets!",1778
19574,Bender,"All right, buddy, we want secrets! And they better be ancient!",1778
19575,Animatronio,Porco metallico! Never shall I reveal how these wonderous machines fit together!,1778
19576,Farnsworth,They fit together?,1778
19577,Animatronio,I said no such thing. And then I died!,1778
19578,Fry,"You're right, Professor. This thing doesn't fly.",1778
19579,Farnsworth,"Don't sit in there, you idiot! That's dangerous!",1778
19580,Animatronio,"Basta! As I live, thou shan't discover the great secret!",1778
19581,Fry,"Bye, Animatronio!",1778
19582,Farnsworth,My God! Why would Leonardo's machine's brought us here?,1779
19583,Fry,I don't know. Let's ask this guy.,1779
19584,Leonardo da Vinci,I am Leonardo.  Welcome to Planet Vinci.,1779
19585,Farnsworth,My God!,1779
19586,Fry,That's what I was gonna say!,1779
19587,Farnsworth,Leonardo! You're alive? Here?,1780
19588,Leonardo,"You have learned my great secret. I was but a visitor to Earth. In truth, I am what you call a space alien.",1780
19589,Farnsworth,Oh!,1780
19590,Fry,"It's an honor to meet you, Leonardo. And may I say you were great in Titanic. The Beach? Neh.",1780
19591,Farnsworth,"That's Leonardo DiCaprio, you blockhead!",1780
19592,Fry,Looks like eating rocks wasn't as dumb as you said.,1780
19593,Fry,So what do people do for fun here?,1781
19594,Leonardo,Do you enjoy partying all night with plenty of ale and lusty women?,1781
19595,Fry,I sure do!,1781
19596,Leonardo,Not us. We spend our leisure time in the mathematics museum. Planet Vinci is basically a single colossal university.,1781
19597,Fry,How your football team?,1781
19598,Leonardo,Learned.,1781
19599,Farnsworth,Ooh! I'm going to check out that math lecture.,1781
19600,Leonardo,"Would you like to hear the lecture, too, Fry?",1781
19601,Fry,No. It would just go in one ear and out some other hole.,1781
19602,Leonardo,"Come, sit down.",1781
19603,Fry,"Now that I can do.  I have a terrible secret to confess, Mr. DiCaprio. I'm not very smart.",1781
19604,Leonardo,I appreciate your candor.,1781
19605,Fry,I don't even know what language you're speaking.,1781
19606,Leonardo,"I, too, have a confession. You see, here on Planet Vinci, I am the stupidest person.",1781
19607,Fry,What? Who possibly think you're stupid?,1781
19608,Biff,"Duh, I'm Leonardo. I don't know the mass of the Higgs boson.",1781
19609,Woman,"Duh, I have to draw in pencil, because I don't know how to use Rendering software.",1781
19610,Leonardo,Stupid Biff. Thinks he's so smart.,1781
19611,Fry,"He looks stronger than you, too.",1781
19612,Leonardo,I went to Earth because I could no longer stand the ridicule. But being surrounded by even stupider people was equally infuriating.,1781
19613,Fry,I can see myself in your shiny button.,1781
19614,Leonardo,"Inventing is what makes me happy. Or did, until I misplaced the plans for my masterpiece.",1781
19615,Fry,You mean these?,1781
19616,Leonardo,"The Macchina Magnifica? Infinity joy! Fry, my friend, you have given my life a meaning again!",1781
19617,Farnsworth,"That calculus lecture was harder than I expected. We had to answer every question in the form of an opera. I have a lot of homework for tomorrow, if I don't want to be  Embarrassed!",1781
19618,[Scene,"Planet Vinci. Concert Hall. Fry nails a banner to wall with another nail. It reads ""Today",1782
19619,Fry,,1782
19620,Leonardo,"For centuries, you've all ridiculed me. Especially you, Biff.",1782
19621,Biff,Nice hat!,1782
19622,Leonardo,"But, at long last, this invention will show you. It will show you all. Behold, my unstoppable doomsday machine!",1782
19623,Fry,And I helped! Wait. You told me it was an unstoppable ice cream machine.,1782
19624,Leonardo,Ice cream is just a by-product of the machine. It's primary purpose is to exterminate everyone who ever made me feel inferior!,1782
19625,Biff,"Oh, I'm so scared!",1782
19626,Girl,"Bring it on, dum-dum.",1782
19627,Leonardo,Oh yeah? Let's see how hard you are laughing when my doomsday machine chops off your face!,1782
19628,Farnsworth,"Leonardo, stop!  I want in on this!",1782
19629,Fry,"Are you crazy, Professor?",1782
19630,Farnsworth,"I hate these nerds. Just because I'm stupider than them, they think they're smarter than me. Kill them all, starting with the math teacher!",1782
19631,Farnsworth,I knew this final invention would be a humdinger!,1782
19632,Leonardo,"Yes, we three idiots will finally have our revenge.",1782
19633,Fry,"I don't think so! You two make me ashamed to call myself an idiot.  There's always going to someone smarter than you, so the only way to be happy is to make the most of what you've got.",1782
19634,Leonardo,But you've got nothing.,1782
19635,Fry,Oh no? I've got one single nail and another nail to nail it in with. And I'm gonna stop this infernal ice cream machine once and for all!,1782
19636,Biff,Some doomsday machine! It barely killed anyone!,1782
19637,Leonardo,"Oh, yeah? Well, take this!",1782
19638,Farnsworth,"Oh, my.",1782
19639,Girl,Poor Leonardo da Vinci. He sure was stupid.,1782
19640,Farnsworth,"Fry, I admire what you did today, and I'm deeply sorry for insulting your intellect. Your tiny, tiny intellect. Oops, there I go again, you dope. I mean, dummy.",1783
19641,Fry,"It's okay. I may not be clever, but I have a good heart. That's what my mom used to say.",1783
19642,Farnsworth,She was a wise woman.,1783
19643,Fry,"Also, that I'm not much to look at.",1783
19644,Farnsworth,"A wise woman, indeed.",1783
19645,Farnsworth,I fear I may not survive this war reenactment. I can't believe we’re only twelve feet from the parking lot.,1784
19646,Fry,This is every bit as fun as the real Civil War.,1784
19647,Leela,Not the Civil War private. We’re reinacting the Sith-il War.,1784
19648,Fry,Sith? What the Hoth?,1784
19649,Bender,Enemy invaders! Up in yonder sky!,1784
19650,Darth Stroyer,I am Darth Stroyer.,1784
19651,Fry,Darth Stroyer? That’s the stupidest name I’ve ever heard.,1784
19652,Leela,Let’s hear the rest.,1784
19653,Darth Trocious,Darth Trocious.,1784
19654,Darth Sploder,Darth Sploder.,1784
19655,Darth Urderer,Darth Urderer.,1784
19656,Darth Ithead,Darth Ithead.,1784
19657,Leela,Company! Attack!,1784
19658,Hermes,Don’t fire until you see the greens of their eyes! It saves on bullets.,1784
19659,Darth Stroyer,I shall rip out your heart and show it to you!  It is done.,1784
19660,Scruffy,The candle that burns twice as bright burns half as long.  Mhrm.,1784
19661,Darth Sploder,You're dead!,1784
19662,Farnsworth,"No, I'm just very old.",1784
19663,Darth Sploder,Woah! That's good acting!,1784
19664,Fry,"It's payback time, Sploder!",1784
19665,Darth Sploder,Tell my mother... to pick me up outside Quiznos.,1784
19666,Hermes,,1784
19667,Bender,,1784
19668,Darth Trocious,"You're dead, Earth man!",1784
19669,Bender,,1784
19670,Fry,"If you were really dead, you wouldn't be laughing so hard.",1784
19671,Bender,"Yeah, yeah. Death's a big deal to you flesh bags. But in case you didn't notice, I'm a robot.",1784
19672,Fry,"So? What if something heavy fell on you, like a church? You could still die.",1784
19673,Bender,"Nuh-uh! My wireless back-up unit saves a copy of me every day. So, if my body gets killed, big whoop, I just download into another body. I'm immortal, baby!",1784
19674,Amy,What? Then how come you always scream so much when you're in danger?,1784
19675,Bender,I never said I wasn't a drama queen.,1784
19676,Hermes,And the winner of the war is... let me just cross check my tabulation here. Factor in the corsages for the widows.,1784
19677,Bender,"Hurry up, you number-crunching crumb-nuncher! Everybody but me is dying of old age!",1784
19678,Hermes,"Okay. The winners, at a net cost of only $12 per life cut tragically short, our Sith Overlords.",1784
19679,Darth Sploder,Hot diggity! I mean...  Supreme diggity.,1784
19680,Fry,"It may have been a fake war, but my scuffed knee is all too real.",1785
19681,Farnsworth,"I have pain in joints I had removed a century ago. Bender, bring me my soft chair with the wheels on it.",1785
19682,Bender,Your wheelchair?,1785
19683,Farnsworth,I don't need a wheelchair! The one with the wheels!,1785
19684,Bender,Poor flimsy humans. Don't you wish you were flawless like me? A towering inferno of physical perfection?,1785
19685,Leela,"I hate to pop your blimp-like ego, but you're not perfect.",1785
19686,Bender,Am so!,1785
19687,Leela,Are not!,1785
19688,Bender,Is too!,1785
19689,Leela,Says who?,1785
19690,Bender,"Says the only human whose opinion I even remotely respect.  Inspector 5, the best inspector a kid could want. The day I was built, he looked me over, probably with tears of pride in his eyes, and proclaimed to all the world, by means of this scrap of paper, that I was perfect and infallible in every way!",1785
19691,Farnsworth,"Hey, Mr. Perfect? You wet the chair.",1785
19692,Bender,Huh? Wasn't me. Must be some of that urine your all so proud of.,1785
19693,Fry,"That's not urine, it's oil.",1785
19694,Bender,Impossible! I'm triple sealed to prevent any chance of ...,1785
19695,Zoidberg,"You call that an ink defense?  Goodbye, friends!",1785
19696,Bender,"What could have caused the leak? Excessive heat, on the count that I'm so hot?",1786
19697,Farnsworth,"Alas, no. Oh, Bender, I'm afraid it's a symptom of a fatal defect.",1786
19698,Bender,"Yeah, fatal schmatal. If I die I can just download my backup copy into a new, equally fabulous, body.",1786
19699,Farnsworth,That's just it! You can't. You were built without a backup unit.,1786
19700,Bender,There's no backup copy of me?,1786
19701,Farnsworth,"That's what I just said, you mortal coil.",1786
19702,Bender,"So, if I die...",1786
19703,Farnsworth,You die. Or as you put it,1786
19704,Bender,No!,1786
19705,Bender,I can't believe it! I'm gonna die.,1788
19706,Fry,"How much time does he have left, Professor?",1788
19707,Farnsworth,Between a minute and a billion years.,1788
19708,Fry,"Well, at least you can plan accordingly.",1788
19709,Bender,Dying sucks butt! How do you living beings cope with mortality?,1788
19710,Leela,Violent outbursts.,1788
19711,Amy,General sluttiness.,1788
19712,Fry,"Thanks to denial, I'm immortal.",1788
19713,Bender,"Damn it, I'm supposed to be perfect. Inspector 5 gave me his blessing!  How could he bring me into this world knowing I gonna die?",1788
19714,Zoidberg,"So you wish you were never born, maybe?",1788
19715,Bender,"Yes, anything less than immortality is a complete waste of time!",1788
19716,Zoidberg,Then suicide it is. Step into my office. I'll give you a nice Kervorking.,1788
19717,Bender,Not until I hunt down Inspector 5 and beat an explanation out of him!,1788
19718,Leela,"I'm all for a good beating, but you'll never find him. Product inspectors are bureaucrats, faceless bean counters who blend into the woodwork.",1788
19719,Hermes,I beg to differ!,1788
19720,Bender,Stinking bureaucrats! I hate 'em.,1788
19721,Leela,"Then again, you might be able to find Inspector 5 with the help of another seasoned bureaucrat.",1788
19722,Bender,"Hermes, old pal!",1788
19723,Hermes,"Old pal? 8.5 seconds ago, you said you hated me.",1788
19724,Bender,Time heals all wounds.,1788
19725,Hermes,"You know what? I will help you, but only to prove I'm not just a paper-pushing file-jockey.",1788
19726,Amy,Will you be taking your portable filing cabinet?,1788
19727,Hermes,None of your beeswax!,1788
19728,Hermes,"I'll only be away an hour, but I'm counting on you to do the all-critical filing in my absence. Shall we review alphabetical order.  A, B, C, D...",1790
19729,Leela,Get out of my office!,1790
19730,Old man,Yes. I'd like to request a death certificate.,1791
19731,Woman,Sorry. That's Building C.,1791
19732,Hermes,The Central Bureaucracy maintains records on all bureaucrats. We should be able to look up Inspector 5.,1791
19733,Man,And the other potential entrant?,1791
19734,Hermes,"Uh, he's my pencil sharpener.",1791
19735,Bender,You betcha!,1791
19736,Man,,1791
19737,Hermes,I maintain a cubicle here for weekend getaways.,1792
19738,Bender,"Wow! Until now, I thought giant cubes were exciting.",1792
19739,Bender,I did like the part where they screamed.,1792
19740,Hermes,This is mine. Right next to the center square.,1792
19741,Center Square Guy,"Sorry, Hermes. I drank all your white-out.",1792
19742,Hermes,"Once I log in, I can access Inspector 5's profile.",1792
19743,Bender,Damn it! It won't go on.,1792
19744,Hermes,That's because you're not me.,1792
19745,Bender,Hooray! It won't go on!,1792
19746,Hermes,The bureaucra-scan won't let anyone but the assigned bureaucrat log in.,1792
19747,Computer,"Identity confirmed. Also, you have a rectangular mass in your colon.",1792
19748,Hermes,That's a calculator. I ate it to gain its power.,1792
19749,Bender,You locate Inspector 5 while I slip into my ass-kicking feet.,1792
19750,Hermes,Sweet File-not-found of Puget Sound! His record's been blanked!,1792
19751,Bender,"Aw, man! How am I going to find some anonymous guy I don't know anything about?",1792
19752,Center Square Guy,I recommend the men's room of the TWA terminal.,1792

19756,Bender,It's on!,1794
19757,Hermes,"No! This is impossible! Quit blacking out and look at this. Inspectors 1, 2, 3, 4... 6. There's no trace of Inspector 5!",1794
19758,Bender,But 5's the one we want. Maybe if I kicked the asses of Inspector 2 plus Inspector 3...,1794
19759,Hermes,"Addition never solve anything, man. Let's cut our losses and go home.",1794
19760,Bender,"So I'm doomed to die? And I'll never even get to punch whoever's responsible? Oh, what's the point.",1795
19761,Hermes,"Bender, no! Suicide isn't necessarily the answer!",1795
19762,Bender,"It's not a suicide booth, you lard-ass. It's a phone booth.",1795
19763,Hermes,"They have phones in booths now? Finally, I don't have to lug this cellphone around.",1795
19764,Mom,Who the hell is this? How did you get this number?,1795
19765,Bender,Is this the robot company? Cause I have a complaint about a defective robot. His name is me!,1795
19766,Mom,"A defective robot, you say?",1795
19767,Bender,"Well, things are starting to look up.",1795
19768,Hermes,Look up!  Who did you call? Dial-a-bomb?,1795
19769,Bender,"No, I just told the robot company I was defective.",1795
19770,Hermes,You dumb cocktail shaker! Mom won't allow a defective product to tarnish her good name! She'll kill you.,1795
19771,Bender,"Big whoop. I'll just download into a new... Oh, right. If I die, I die. Speaking of which–",1795
19772,Mom,That's what you get for calling tech support.,1795
19773,Bender,I can't run anymore. I'll have to skip.,1796
19774,Hermes,Just a few more feet. We have to get to that pile of dead bears by 7,1797
19775,Bender,A pile of dead bears can only mean one thing. But what?,1797
19776,Hermes,It's the 7,1797
19777,Bender,"Aw, shoot!",1797
19778,Killbot,"Someone said ""shoot!""",1797
19779,Bender,"Well, we're boned!",1797
19780,Hermes,"No, we're not! We just go to limbo!",1797
19781,Bender,"But I'm not design to bend that low, not without limbo music.  That'll do it. Ow! Ow! Ow!",1797
19782,Killbot 1,We're gonna get fired.,1797
19783,Killbot 2,"Someone said ""fire!""",1797

19785,Hermes,Twelve straight hours of limbo. I haven't done that since my honeymoon.,1798
19786,Bender,Hermes! Hermes! Remember that flock of bats?,1798
19787,Hermes,I sure do.,1798
19788,Bender,That was fun.,1798
19789,Bender,Where are we?,1798
19790,Hermes,I have no idea.,1798
19791,Bender,Hey. We're just a stone's throw from Tijuana.  See?,1798
19792,Mexican Man,¡Dios mío! A rock has fallen here in the outskirts of Tijuana.,1798
19793,Bender,Is it within city limits?,1798
19794,Mexican Man,"I think, yes.",1798
19795,Bender,Told you!,1798
19796,Hermes,"Hey, you wanna celebrate our escape? Maybe grab a shot of tequila and take in a big-league cockfight?",1798
19797,Bender,"Sure. No, wait. I was built in Tijuana. Maybe Inspector 5 still works there. He better do some splaining. Before I mash up some face guacamole.",1798

19873,Amy,I guess not. That never occurred to me.,1806

20060,Kif,"Yes, I did.",1845
20061,Morris Katz,"Where's your candidate, Farnsworth? I have a long list of students to humiliate today.  You're late, Miss Wong.",1846
20062,Amy,"Oh, God, this is like one of those nightmares.",1846
20063,Farnsworth,"Here, take my lab coat.",1846
20064,Katz,Allow me to introduce your examining committee in descending  order of grumpiness. Professor Ogden Wernstrom.,1846
20065,Farsnworth,Wernstrom!,1846
20066,Katz,"Downtown Professor of Applied Physics, Ethan 'Bubblegum' Tate.",1846
20067,Tate,I see by your curriculum vitæ that you're a Sagittarius.,1846
20068,Katz,And Professor Fisherprice Shpeekenshpell.,1846
20069,Shpeekenshpell,The cow says... Moo.,1846
20070,Farnsworth,"He proved that 50 years ago, and he's been coasting on it ever since.",1846
20071,Katz,"I am the esteemed Professor Morris Katz, and you are wasting my time. Proceed.",1846
20072,Amy,"Imagine, if you will...",1846
20073,Katz,"Oh, God!",1846
20074,Amy,"A gigantic spherical generator, one that could provide unlimited energy, because it's essentially in Perpetual Motion.",1846
20075,Wermstrom,"Young lady, have you been drinking?",1846
20076,Amy,"Well, yes, but that's not revelant. I'm talking about Earth. Earth's the generator.  Suppose this basketball is the whole world.",1846
20077,Tate,"To many young men in the inner city, it is.",1846
20078,Amy,"As it spins, it's producing an enormous magnetic field. If we could use that field to generate electric current, we could actually harness the Earth's rotational ener... Ener...",1846
20079,Farnsworth,"Yes, tapping the Earth's ener-kerchoo. Go on.",1846
20080,Amy,"Sorry, I'm super-allergic to cats. Professor Katz, would you mind.",1846
20081,Katz,"Miss Wong, I mind everything.",1846
20082,Amy,Sorry.,1846
20083,Katz,Enough. The committee members will now vote yea or nay. Nay.,1846
20084,Wernstrom,Nay.,1846
20085,Tate,Hell nay.,1846
20086,Shpeekenshpell,"The horse says, doctorate denied.",1846
20087,Fry,"It's okay, Amy. I don't have a fancy degree either, but today I'm a prominent boy in the package delivery field.",1847
20088,Nibbler,"Now that I'm a full and equal member of the crew, I pledge my loyalty, my perspicacity, and, dare I say it, my friendship.",1848
20089,Hermes,"Leela, muzzle that skunk! We can't stop a meeting for some cute, fuzzy, little...  Hey, look, a kitty cat.",1848
20090,Amy,Get away you mangy ball of Histamines.,1848
20091,Hermes,,1848
20092,Farnsworth,"People, please, I'm trying to run a business, so I get to hold kitty.",1848
20093,Fry,Over here. I wanna hold him.,1848
20094,Bender,Aw! Its anus looks like an asterisk.,1848
20095,Leela,"Captain Fuzzytoes reporting for duty. I mean, cutie.",1849
20096,Nibbler,My best friend died in that uniform. I hate that cat!,1849
20097,Amy,"If I had a spray bottle, I'd give him such a spritzing.",1849
20098,Nibbler,I'll tell you one thing. Nothing acts that cute without some ulterior motive.,1849
20099,Amy,Aw! You want your diapey changed?,1849
20100,Nibbler,"Powder, please.",1849
20101,Amy,Here's my new theory. That is one adorable cat.,1849
20102,Nibbler,I guess I was just jealous. I do miss being Leela's schnookums. I'm going to apologize and hope for a pity pet.,1849
20103,Leela,,1849
20104,Amy,The cat is evil! We have proof!,1850
20105,Nibbler,It was summoning a saucer!,1850
20106,Farnsworth,"Of course it wanted a saucer, you idiot. A saucer of dewicious cweam.",1850
20107,Nibbler,"You fool, this isn't about the cream.",1850
20108,Bender,"It's pwonounced ""cweam"".",1850
20109,Zoidberg,I'm petting mine down to the bone.,1850
20110,Fry,Just stwoke its fwffy fur.,1850
20111,Hermes,Scwatch its fwubby chin.,1850
20112,Bender,Fweeble its fwooby pwow.,1850
20113,Amy,"No, no!",1850
20114,Nibbler,What do cats need with that much yarn and cobalt?,1851
20115,Amy,They're doing something downstairs. We've got to find out what.,1851
20116,Bender,"Where do you think you're going, no-cat?",1851
20117,Amy,"Uh, the basement. I think I left the air hockey table on.",1851
20118,Bender,"Without a cat, you ain't going nowhere.",1851
20119,Nibbler,Can you at least tell us what's going on down there?,1851
20120,Farnsworth,"We're certainly not building something sinister, if that's what your implying. Now, come on, Bender. Something sinister won't build itself.",1851
20121,Amy,Professor Katz's last name is Katz. Do you think he has something to do with these cats?,1852
20122,Nibbler,The conclusion is an inescapable as it is moronic.,1852
20123,Amy,,1854
20124,Nibbler,"I warn you, if I have to get cute, it's gonna get ugly.",1854
20125,Amy,He's dead!,1854
20126,Nibbler,Wait. What are these strings on his lap?  What the... He isn't dead. He's one of those dog-operated puppets that's been adapted for use by a cat!,1854
20127,Amy,So I had my doctorate denied by that fuzzball?  Bad kitty!,1854
20128,Amy,They actually built the planetary ratchet from my thesis!  Uh-oh.,1856
20129,Nibbler,What the...,1856
20130,Thubanian Leader,"Well, look what the me dragged in.",1856
20131,Nibbler,You can talk!,1856
20132,Thubanian Leader,You can talk?,1856
20133,Nibbler,How ironic. Two hyper-intelligent beings both pretending to be simple house pets!,1856
20134,Thubanian Leader,"Say, do you know Obliteron? He pretends to be a hamster, but...",1856
20135,Amy,"Yeah, that's really great. Could you please tell us what's going on?",1856
20136,Thubanian Leader,"What? Oh, right! You see, my associates and I are from the ninth planet of the star you call Thuban. Long ago, life there was ideal.",1856
20137,Nibbler,Earth!,1856
20138,Thubanian Leader,Indubitably. Although we call it Blue Blue Shiny Ball.,1856
20139,Amy,The Great Pyramid at Giza!,1856
20140,Thubanian Leader,"Yes. The Egyptians viewed us as gods, but ironically that was our downfall.  But the technology to save our planet was lost. Lost, that is, until I heard you speak at Mars University.",1856
20141,Amy,"So you called my thesis a fat sack of barf, and then you stole it?",1856
20142,Thubanian Leader,Welcome to Academia.,1856
20143,Nibbler,He intends to siphon off Earth's rotational energy!,1856
20144,Amy,"Earth will come to a stop, and...",1856
20145,Thubanian Leader,"Half of you will cook, and half of you will freeze. Earth will be one big McDLT. We just got that commercial last year.",1856
20146,Amy,"Oh, yeah, smarty paws? You may have built the ratchet but you can't reach the core without 4,000 miles of superconducting wire.",1856
20147,Thubanian Leader,Quite.,1856
20148,Nibbler,"Even so, you'd still need a tremendously powerful static charge to trigger the process.",1856
20149,Thubanian Leader,Ever had a cat rub up against you?,1856
20150,Nibbler,"If you're propositioning me, I'm not interested.",1856
20151,Thubanian Leader,"I'm talking about the charge generated when 50,000 felines rub against a single surface. Professor?",1856
20152,Thubanian Leader,"Soon the world will come to a stop, and there's nothing you can do to stop it. The stopping of the world, that is. It's unstoppable.",1856
20153,Thubanian Leader,The Earth is coming to a stop. Keep your eyes on the kitties and push!,1856
20154,Nibbler,,1856
20155,Leela,Nibbler? Poopsie-doodle?,1856
20156,Thubanian Leader,"Mr. Winkles, Smudge-Smudge. Quick, dance with each other.",1856
20157,Nibbler,"Aw!  Damn, they are good.",1856
20158,Thubanian Leader,"We're coming to a full stop. All cats, to your posts!",1856
20159,Calculon,"Catastrophe Beach Party. Scene One. Cue disaster effects, and action!",1858
20160,Calculon,Cut! That extra looked at the camera. We'll have to do it again.,1858
20161,Thubanian Leader,And now to transfer your planet's rotational energy to my home world.,1859
20162,Thubanian,,1860
20163,Hermes,What's all this cat hair on my sweater?,1861
20164,Bender,And why am I full of sand? And Tootsie Rolls?,1861
20165,Nibbler,You were all under the spell of those obnoxious space cats.,1861
20166,Thubanian Leader,,1861
20167,Farnsworth,"Quickly! If we turn the ratchet the other way, perhaps we can restart the Earth.",1862
20168,Hermes,"It won't turn. Push harder, Bender!",1862
20169,Bender,"I can't. You should have called my cousin, Turner.",1862
20170,Amy,It's hopeless. Even in theory the device can only apply force in one direction.,1863
20171,Fry,Can someone open a window? It's getting a little warm in here.,1863
20172,Bender,Is that better?,1863
20173,Amy,"Shmezzus, it's hot! Why'd I have to invent that awful device?",1865
20174,Farnsworth,"Amy, technology isn't intrinsically good or evil. It's how it's used. Like the death ray.",1865
20175,Amy,"Maybe you're right. I guess that science has to keep pushing forward with the hope that...  That's it! Pushing forward! Professor, I know how to restart the Earth.",1865
20176,Farnsworth,That's it. I'll assemble your committee!,1865
20177,Amy,"The ratchet won't turn backwards, but what if we kept pushing it forward?  Earth would start turning again.",1866
20178,Wernstrom,"Yes, the wrong direction!",1866
20179,Amy,So?,1866
20180,Tate,"Gentlemen,  let's get this globe trotting.",1866
20181,Amy,It's working! Just a little faster!,1867
20182,Zoidberg,But we're plotzing here!,1867
20183,Amy,Then look at Nibbler!,1867
20184,Thubanian Leader,,1868
20185,Farnsworth,"And though the world is now spinning in the wrong direction, it's good enough. Well done, Amy.",1869
20186,Wernstrom,I'm honored to begrudgingly present you with your Ph.D. in applied physics.,1869
20187,Tate,"Also, some kind of sportsmanship award I had in my glove compartment.",1869
20188,Amy,Yay! I'm finally done with school. How's the job market?,1869
20189,Shpeekenshpell,Ruff!,1869
20190,Farnsworth,"Congratulations, Dr. Wong!",1869
20191,Kif,Congratulations.,1869
20192,Nibbler,Permission to come aboard?,1869
20193,Leela,"Granted, schnookums.",1869
20194,Farnsworth,"You've got a bright future, Amy. As sure as the Sun sets in the east.",1870
20195,Hermes,Item one... Duck!,1871
20196,Prof. Farnsworth,"Cubert, you crapscallion! What aren't you in school?",1871
20197,Cubert,"I couldn't get past the protesters. A bunch of smiling, angry people were handing out these anti-evolution flyers.",1871
20198,Farnsworth,Evolution is under attack in our schools? To the science mobile.,1871
20199,Leela,You mean the ship?,1871
20200,Farnsworth,Yes. The science mobile!,1871
20201,Leela,"It's just that you've never called it that before, but okay.",1871
20202,Woman,"I don't understand evolution, and I have to protect my kids from understanding it! We will not give in to the thinkers!",1872
20203,Farnsworth,"You people are as loud as you are ignorant. Now, get back on your turnip trucks and go home!",1872
20204,Hydroponic farmer,"That is an insultingly accurate stereotype, sir!",1872
20205,Farnsworth,"As a professor of science, I assure you that we did, in fact, evolve from filthy monkey-men.",1872
20206,Dr. Banjo,"I cannot speak for you, sir, but my ancestors were not monkeys. They were orangutans. Hard-working, patriotic orangutans.",1872
20207,Farnsworth,Dr. Banjo?,1872
20208,Dr. Banjo,"In the fur. And I remind you that evolution is merely a theory. Like gravity, or the shape of the Earth.",1872
20209,Flying Spaghetti Monster,"Hey, Professor, I'm a Flying Spaghetti Monster. You seriously believe I've descended from some kind of flightless manicotti?",1872
20210,Farnsworth,Yes!,1872
20211,Banjo,"Oh, please. A far more logical explanation is the undisprovable science of Creatureism. All life was created in its present form seven thousand years ago, by a fantastical creature from outer space!",1872
20212,Farnsworth,Bunk!,1872
20213,Banjo,"Oh!  If you elitist, East Coast evolution is real, why has no one found the missing link between modern humans and ancient apes?",1872
20214,Farnsworth,We did find it!  It's called Homo erectus!,1872
20215,Banjo,"Then you have proven my case, sir, for no one has found a link between apes and this Homo erectus.",1872
20216,Farnsworth,"Yes, they have!  It's called Homo habilis!",1872
20217,Banjo,Ah-ha! But no one has found the missing link between ape and this so called Homo habilis.,1872
20218,Farnsworth,"Yes, they have!  It's called Australopithecus africanus!",1872
20219,Banjo,"Oh-ho! I've got you now!  Fair enough, but where, then, is the missing link between apes and this Darwinius masillae? Answer me that, Professor!",1872
20220,Farnsworth,"Okay, granted, that one missing link is still missing, but just because we haven't found it doesn't mean it doesn't exist!",1872
20221,Banjo,Things don't exist simply because you believe in them. Thus sayeth the Almighty Creature in the Sky!,1872
20222,[Scene,"Olduvai Gorge. A sign reads ""Welcome to Olduvai Gorge. Birthplace of Ryan Seacrest . The crew are excavating.]",1873
20223,Farnsworth,"I'll show that banana-swilling, poop-slinger! We just need to find that last missing link.",1873
20224,Leela,"I found a missing link. It seems to be half-man, half-toucan.",1873
20225,Farnsworth,Not what we're looking for. Throw it in the soup!,1873
20226,Hermes,And here's something.  Uh-oh. It's another one of Fry's dogs.,1873
20227,Fry,"Did you find something, Hermes?",1873
20228,Hermes,,1873
20229,Amy,I hate chiseling right after a manicure. Oh! Darn it! I broke off one of my fingers!,1873
20230,Zoidberg,"What, too soon?",1873
20231,Cubert,I highly doubt a Jurassic Elaphrosaurus has access to neckwear.,1873
20232,Zoidberg,I knew I should have gone with the ring-around-the-collar joke.,1873
20233,Bender,"Hey, look! I found a robot fossil!",1873
20234,Farnsworth,"That's a bedspring, you dumb bedspring! There are no robot fossils!",1873
20235,Bender,What? Who says I didn't evolve?,1873
20236,Farnsworth,Everybody! Robots were created quite recently. It was in all the papers.,1873
20237,Bender,Then explain this!,1873
20238,Farnsworth,"I've hit a rich vein of missing links. Java Man, Piltdown Man, Manfred Mann.  It's the elusive missing missing link! This will show Banjo, once and for all!",1873
20239,Fry,What the...,1873
20240,Amy,"Oh, that's mine.",1873
20241,Bender,"Hmm, my tux doesn't fit. Probably because I've grown so much since I last wore it, or evolved, one might say.",1874
20242,Farnsworth,One might not say that! Your tux doesn't fit because you stole it from a boy!,1874
20243,Bender,You mean a man! It was his Bar Mitzvah.,1874
20244,Ben Beeler,"Welcome, museum members. Or, as I like to call you, future exhibits.",1874
20245,Zoidberg,He's good.,1874
20246,Beeler,"Tonight, we have a new resident here in the hall of Hominids, generously donated by its discoverer, Hubert Farnsworth. Ladies and gentlemen, Homo farnsworth.",1874
20247,Farnsworth,"Once again, science saves the day. The end.",1874
20248,Beeler,"And now, to discuss the scientific implications of this discovery, our new museum curator, Dr. Banjo!",1874
20249,Banjo,"Thank you Professor Farnsworth, for your generous gift, which has, once and for all dis-proven evolution.  Behold! Homo farnsworth frolicking with dinosaurs at the moment of creation.",1874
20250,Farnsworth,I don't want to live on this planet anymore.,1874
20251,Farnsworth,Faster! Faster! Just drop me off at that asteroid over there.,1876
20252,Leela,"Wow, this planetoid is completely lifeless.",1877
20253,Farnsworth,Not lifeless enough! Set up my shack so that I can kick you out of it!,1877
20254,Fry,"Professor, is this your only water source? It looks like Diet Dr. Pepper.",1877
20255,Farnsworth,It's not that bad. It's just laden with toxic minerals. But not for long.,1877
20256,Fry,What's in the tube?,1877
20257,Farnsworth,Microscopic Nanobots.  They're tiny robots I designed to eat up nasty irritants.,1877
20258,Fry,"Speaking of nasty irritants, what's going to become of Cubert?",1877
20259,Farnsworth,"Who? Oh, my son. Don't worry, he's been safely abandoned with his godfather.",1877
20260,Zoidberg,"Cubert,  I felt we needed some father-son bonding time, so I found a couple of  baseball gloves and boiled them up for lunch.",1878
20261,Cubert,Why don't you just go to Hell!,1878
20262,Zoidberg,Wait! We still have to discuss the facts of life. What are they?,1878
20263,Hermes,"Okay, I finished moving the last grand piano. Now can we have our pizza?",1879
20264,Farnsworth,"You'll get your damned pizza, you parasite! First, let see if my Nanobots have purified the water yet.  Ah, the water's as sterile as my milkman-trusting father. But what's this? The Nanobots have gotten more complex.",1879
20265,Bender,"What's that you say? Those robots have evolved all by themselves, you say?",1879
20266,Farnsworth,It wasn't by themselves! I put them there. I'm a genius. Get over it!,1879
20267,Amy,"Hey look, now they gotten bigger.",1879
20268,Farnsworth,Good heavens! Trilobots!,1879
20269,Leela,"Oh, no! My sunglasses were in there!",1879
20270,Hermes,Let's get the pizza out of here.,1879
20271,Amy,"Look, there's a cave-like hole in that mountain. It might be a cave.",1879
20272,Leela,Does anyone have a lighter?,1879
20273,Bender,Hang on.,1879
20274,Leela,"Okay, we've got shelter and just enough precious food to ward off starvation.",1879
20275,Hermes,It's pizza time.,1879
20276,Amy,Pineapple?,1879
20277,Hermes,So much for that.,1879
20278,Zoidberg,"Hello, I remembered you like superheroes so I painted you a mural on your wall.  This is Father-Man. He fights crime to earn Son-Boy's respect. Is it working?",1880
20279,Cubert,This is sucky! You suck! Who taught you to do three-point perspective? I could make a better mural with my butt!,1880
20280,Zoidberg,,1880
20281,Hermes,Nothing like a cave for a good night's sleep. So what do we have to eat that's not poisoned with pineapple?,1881
20282,Farnsworth,"I packed plenty of food, but it's all in dehydrated pill form.",1881
20283,Leela,Then we need water from that pond. We'll have to fight our way past the Trilobots.  Go! Go! Hit anything that moves!,1881
20284,Fry,Whoa.,1881
20285,Bender,Wow.,1881
20286,Amy,A whole forest grew overnight.,1881
20287,Farnsworth,All these trees are robotic. I can't believe how quickly they sprung up.,1881
20288,Bender,I can. Robots do everything faster. Including evolving and believing how quickly things spring up.,1881
20289,Leela,,1881
20290,Fry,Help! Police!,1881
20291,Leela,Everybody grab a club.,1881
20292,Fry,,1881
20293,Amy,Look out for the next thing!,1881
20294,Farnsworth,"Great Scott, a Tricycle-tops!",1881
20295,Fry,Woo-hoo! Throw down dinosaurs of the land and sea.  This is a cool way to die!,1881
20296,Cubert,"Dr. Zoidberg? I'm sorry for treating you like a total Zoidberg... I mean, loser.",1882
20297,Zoidberg,Go on.,1882
20298,Cubert,It's just that I get bullied a lot. I guess I kinda make fun of people as a defense mechanism.,1882
20299,Brett Blob,"Hey, Cubert, is that your family mansion?",1882
20300,Cubert,Why don't you ask your mom? She's coming over for a sex visit.,1882
20301,Zoidberg,"Don't worry, I know just how to handle bullies. Just pretend like you're pathetic. Help, I'm scared. I wet myself. I'm crying like a baby and I'm soaking in pee, but what else is new?",1882
20302,Brett,"The pee-babies peed themselves. I'm off to pottery class, dorkwads.",1882
20303,Zoidberg,And that's that.,1882
20304,Cubert,Woah! You're like some kind of dumpster Jedi.,1882
20305,Zoidberg,"So, you wanna come in maybe?  I've got a nice pound cake with a footprint on it.",1882
20306,Fry,Ah! Don't eat my butt!,1883
20307,Leela,"If this is anything like killing that pigeon on my balcony, we've got our work cut out for us.",1883
20308,Farnsworth,"Look out, a solar flare!",1883
20309,Amy,What the shmell happened?,1883
20310,Farnsworth,"A mass extinction.  That solar flare created a huge electromagnetic pulse that while harmless to organic life, short-circuited the robo-dinosaurs.",1883
20311,Leela,Convenient.,1883
20312,Farnsworth,"Only puny, mammal-like robots cowering in caves could survive such a catastrophe.",1883
20313,Bender,"Guys, guys! I taught myself to knit.",1883
20314,Farnsworth,"Wait a moment. If we could scavenge the right parts from these robo-dinos, I might be able to construct a rudimentary spaceship to get us off this planet!",1883
20315,Farnsworth,"Oh, well, it took almost two hours, but it's finished.  Now let's go... to sleep. It's solar powered, so we can't take off until sunrise.",1883
20316,Bender,"Well, let's find something comfy to bed down on.",1883

20845,Mrs. Astor,"My dear, that school is about much more than sewer pipes.",1946
20846,Leela,Really?,1946

22185,Professor Farnsworth,Yes! And I begged Zoidberg to put me out of my misery!  Quickly!,2052

22230,Fry,Hmmm. I consider myself almost completely ignorant of modern medicine.  And I've never heard of Yetiism.,2053
22231,Zoidberg,It mimics the symptoms of hypermalaria exactly.  Hold 'im down while I prepare the antidote.,2053

22233,Zoidberg,Yes.  This contains a concentrated form of the Yeti neurotoxin.,2053

22235,Zoidberg,"Don't lecture me about Alien physiology, Conrad! The pineal neurotoxin neutralises the adrenal neurotoxin. That's why Yetis don't drive themselves mad!",2053

22237,Zoidberg,No time for an injection.  I'll be damned. It did make 'im a double Yeti!,2053

22429,Hermes,Did you see that?,2073
22430,Leela,Are you okay? What just happened?,2073
22431,Fry,"Well, I think the Robot Devil said he'd loved me in Bender's voice, wearing Granny Hester's clothes. I wanna go home!",2073
22432,Robot Devil's ghost,"You still lose, Bender. You failed to kill Fry, so you are banished to Hell.  I get a new body and you get to be a translucid chump 'til the end of time!",2074
22433,Bender's ghost,"Big deal! I saved my friend. As far as I'm concerned, I won.",2074
22434,Robot Devil,"Uh, really?  You may find your victory pyrrhic, when subjected to this lyric, for a trillion years or so. Yeah!",2074
22435,Bender's ghost,Whoa!,2074
22436,Robot Devil,"Hey, where are you going?!",2074
22437,Bender's ghost,I don't know and I don't care!,2074
22438,Bender's ghost,"Yeah, I'm back!  Oh, this guy...",2074
22439,White Robot,"Bender, for your selfless act in saving Fry, I am pleased to welcome you to Robot Heaven.",2074
22440,Bender's ghost,"Shut up, God!",2074
22441,White Robot,Beg pardon?,2074
22442,Bender's ghost,I wanna go back to Robot Earth. I mean regular Earth.,2074
22443,White Robot,"Hey, what are you—  Just get out.",2074
22444,Fry,Woo! I've been through the adventure of a lifetime.  Ow!,2075
22445,Bender,"I'm back, baby!",2075
22446,Fry,You're back from the dead?!,2075
22447,Bender,I'm back from lots of stuff.,2075
22448,Fry,"Oh, Bender, Bender, I missed you so much!  Hey, wait. Did you haunt me?",2075
22449,Hermes,"Well, we're bankrupt in six, five...",2076
22450,Hermes,"Four, three...",2076
22451,Hermes,"Two, one. And we're out of business.",2076
22452,Professor Farnsworth,Good news! We're back in business. We've been hired to deliver an envelope.,2076
22453,Leela,"It's crunch time. Let's do this.  It's for you, Professor.",2076
22454,Professor Farnsworth,"Great delivery, everyone. You're the finest crew I've had the honour to work with.  Oh, my. We're being foreclosed upon. You're all terrible and incompetent!",2076
22455,Amy,I resent that!,2076
22456,Hermes,"Wait. I found a loophole in the mortgage. If we actually pay it, we can keep the building. We just need...  Eleven million dollars.",2077
22457,Bender,And... Boned!,2077
22458,Professor Farnsworth,"Aw. I suppose there's nothing left to do but move out. Leela, Amy, pack us a lunch for our new lives under the bridge while us men reminisce and smoke some stogies.",2077
22459,Leela,"We are not packing lunches, you walking beer commercials. It was you men who drove this company into the ground. Remember Fry's idea to offer free delivery?",2077
22460,Fry,It got us a lot of customers!,2077
22461,Leela,We're a delivery company!,2077
22462,Amy,"If you wanna save this company, you should listen to a woman's idea for once.",2077
22463,Hermes,Okay. What you got?,2077
22464,Leela,An airline!,2077
22465,Amy,"Yeah! Wait, what?",2077
22466,Leela,"We should become a commercial airline. I mean, we've got a ship, and teleporters won't be invented for another fifteen years, according to that guy from the future.",2077
22467,Amy,Wow! That's actually a really good idea for a woman!,2077
22468,Professor Farnsworth,Puff! What else you ladies got?,2077
22469,Bender,Girls-of-Planet-Express calendar!,2077
22470,Fry,"Girly calendar? Great idea, Amy!",2077
22471,Hermes,"Okay, then. Leela, Amy, come to work topless tomorrow.",2077
22472,Leela,Forget it! I promised myself I wouldn't pose naked until I was married.,2077
22473,Hermes,"Sorry. It's in your contract. ""All female employees must pose nude if requested.""",2077
22474,Leela,That's discriminatory!,2077
22475,Hermes,"No, it's in all our contracts. Here's mine. ""All female employees must pose nude if requested.""",2077
22476,Fry,Sounds fun.,2077
22477,Bender,"Back to work, Hermes!",2077
22478,Scruffy,Now that's what I call fine print.,2077
22479,Amy,"Okay, but good luck making a girly calendar with only two female employees.",2077
22480,LaBarbara,"Oh, husband! I'm so excited about this new job.",2078
22481,Hermes,"And it's excited about you, LaBarbara. First order of business is to put on your uniform and take your ID photo.",2078
22482,Leela,"Look, I agree that it makes space walking more comfortable, but, for a photo shoot, it's a little... Unsavoury. Over.",2079
22483,Bender,"Time is money, peaches. Now shut your com link and make love to the camera. And remember",2079
22484,Leela,But the ship is dirty.,2079
22485,Bender,"Uh, whatever. I ran out of film an hour ago.",2079
22486,Professor Farnsworth,"No, no. This won't do. A three-month calendar? What is this, Mercury?",2080
22487,Amy,I told you it wouldn't work.,2080
22488,Professor Farnsworth,"Well, you should've talked louder. Fortunately, I came up with a brilliant idea to save Planet Express. We'll turn it into a commercial airline!",2080
22489,Leela,But that was my idea!,2080
22490,Professor Farnsworth,Then you should've talked louder.  What?,2080
22491,[Scene,Outside the Planet Express headquarters. Bender pulls a Planet Express ship dressed as an airplane out of the building while Scruffy sweeps it. The ship bears the logo,2081
22492,Leela,"There. It was hard work, but it beats posing in demeaning, skimpy modelling outfits.",2081
22493,Professor Farnsworth,"Ladies, here are your demeaning, skimpy stewardess outfits.",2081
22494,Bender,"Sorry, ma'am. I'll have to confiscate your artificial knee cap.",2081
22495,Hattie,"Okay, here you go.",2081
22496,Fry,"Ladies and gentlemen, this is the plane's president speaking.",2081
22497,Fry,We are cleared for takeoff.,2081
22498,Leela,You put Goofus and Ganja in charge? I'm the only trained pilot here.,2081
22499,Professor Farnsworth,"Please, Leela. Who ever heard of a plane with a woman president?",2081
22500,Bender,"Welcome to Plan Am Flight 1 to Acapulsar. The local time on Acapulsar is five years from now.  In the event of a wormhole sendin' us back in time, do not kill your parents. If you who are travelling with small children, help them not to kill you before not killin' your own parents. Now please turn off all electronic devices.",2081
22501,Fry,"Uh, preparing for takeoff.",2081
22502,Man,"I kill you, my friend!",2081
22503,LaBarbara,Now sit back and endure our in-flight entertainment.,2082
22504,Zoidberg,"So what's the deal with airline food, hmm? They offer you two choices, but they're always outta one. Uh, by the way, we're outta both choices.",2082
22505,Petunia,Shut up and put on four episodes of Da Office.,2082
22506,[Scene,The Planet Express plane galley. Bender opens a pink refrigerator labelled,2083
22507,Amana,"Ooh, your hands are warm...  For a Robot.",2083
22508,Bender,"Thanks, baby. I don't know what you're doing back here in the galley, 'cause you got a first-class C.",2083
22509,Leela,"Captain, we were supposed to land two days ago. Is everything— Hey!",2083
22510,Fry,"Are we at the fair yet, Mommy?",2083
22511,Leela,We're not at the any place! And we're out of fuel!,2083
22512,Amy,"Attention, passengers. Please remain seated until the plane comes to a complete crash.",2083
22513,Professor Farnsworth,Perhaps we should reconsider the girly calendar.,2083
22514,Leela,"Flight-attendance log. We've crashed near a river of mercury on a lifeless, mineral world. Supplies are low. Cannibalism, imminent. Radio, busted. Our one hope is to form a society.",2084
22515,Hermes,"Okay, then. Men, let's get hunting. The women folk can cook what we catch.",2084
22516,LaBarbara,"No one put you in charge, husband. I'm the only one here who ever ran a society.",2084
22517,Hermes,Roller derby is not a society!,2084
22518,LaBarbara,"Well, let's put it to a vote, then. All in favour of the jamooca thunderclap?  That would be me.",2084
22519,Hermes,Practically no one. All in favour of me?,2084
22520,Dr. Cahill,Eight to eight. It's a tie.,2084
22521,Professor Farnsworth,We can't trust a woman's math! Count again!,2084
22522,Big rock Alien,"Greetings, soft ones. Who among you is your leader?",2084
22523,Men,He is!,2084
22524,Women,She is!,2084
22525,Big rock Alien,Curious. You're a diarchic society?,2084
22526,Hermes,"Um, maybe. But, whatever we are, I'm the leader of it.",2084
22527,LaBarbara,"Leader? Fat man, you couldn't even run a bath.",2084
22528,LaBarbara,"Well, you sure can run something",2084
22529,Big rock Alien,Silence! Even a young pebble could see your race is divided based on the configuration of your twenty-third chromosome.,2084
22530,Amy,"You mean, ""along gender lines""?",2084
22531,Big rock Alien,Gender?,2084
22532,Sal,"Yes. You knows, guyses, galses... In that order.  Ows!",2084
22533,Big rock Alien,"I am not familiar with this concept of gender. My species has only a single gender, known as nuchacho.",2084
22534,Zoidberg,"Interesting.  Come on, men! Let's kill him!",2084
22535,Big rock Alien,"Your genders differ in many ways, but, as with all things that are different, chocolate and vanilla, Mac and PC, one is always clearly better.",2084
22536,Bender,"Chocolate, Mac, men. The end.",2084
22537,Big rock Alien,"Well, I've got nothing to do for the next eight million years. Therefore, I will administer a series of tests to determine the superior gender. Test number one",2084
22538,Professor Farnsworth,Just ask us some damn questions.,2084
22539,Big rock Alien,Very well. Which is larger? An Italian size four or an American apparel medium?  Test complete. What is the score?,2084
22540,Bender,"Uh... Men, five. Women, less.",2084
22541,Amana,Hey! He's lying.,2084
22542,Big rock Alien,Obviously. That was a test to see who could lie better. The men win that round.,2084
22543,Professor Farnsworth,"In your face, decumbent urinators.",2084
22544,Big rock Alien,"So far, I have learned nothing, but that's probably as much my fault as yours.  The time has come for the final test.",2084
22545,Fry,"Uh, we usually call it the lightning round.",2084
22546,Big rock Alien,"As you may have noticed, it's getting hotter here.",2084
22547,Leela,It's nice.,2084
22548,Fry,It's too hot.,2084
22549,Zoidberg,Would one of you chicks change the thermostat?,2084
22550,Big rock Alien,"Tomorrow morning, this planet makes its closest pass to the sun. You will all be boiled alive like retired circus animals. Unless you somehow can cross the Great Alkali Plains and reach shelter in the Cave of Harmony.",2084
22551,Fry,That sounds hard.,2084
22552,Big rock Alien,"Which ever gender reaches the cave will survive and may the inferior gender burst into something. Flames, I guess.",2084
22553,Hermes,Uh-oh. I think we're walking in circles. I recognise the pattern of striations on that gypsum formation.,2085
22554,Fry,"Also, my shoe that fell off.",2085
22555,Bender,"Oh, God. We're all gonna die in agony.",2085
22556,Small rock Alien,Howdy there. You fellows need some directions?,2085
22557,Bender,"No, we're fine.",2085
22558,Professor Farnsworth,Beat it.,2085
22559,Fry,Don't worry about it.,2085
22560,LaBarbara,"Keep it up, sistren. Only a few more miles to the cave. Let's just buckle down and—",2086
22561,Amy,Look! A clearance sale!,2086
22562,LaBarbara,What?! Where?,2086
22563,LaBarbara,I can't believe that sale was just a mirage. Now we're going to die without so much as a factory second-clutch purse to show for it.,2087
22564,Amy,It would've been nice to shop at Tommy Hilfiger one last time.,2087
22565,Hattie,It wasn't Tommy Hilfi-gigger. It was Linens 'n Things!,2087
22566,Petunia,The hell it was! It was a Juicy Couture!,2087
22567,Leela,I guess we all saw what we wanted to see.,2087
22568,Hermes,We can't make it tonight. We'll set up camp here by this shoe.,2088
22569,Professor Farnsworth,"Oh, gentlemen. When that sun rises in the morning, we're toast. These are our last moments together. So, if anyone's got any good fart jokes, now would be the time.",2088
22570,Amy,It's a schmundered degrees and all we have to drink are non-diet sodas.,2089
22571,Petunia,It's gonna ruin ma figger.,2089
22572,Leela,"Wait. I forgot that Amana here is a refrigerator. If we could supercharge her freon with a gas compressor, we might survive the heat and make it to the cave.",2089
22573,Amana,"Hey, yeah! But the only gas compressor on this planet is inside Bender's ass.",2089
22574,Dr. Cahill,Was that a fart joke? Because I don't find those amusing.,2089
22575,LaBarbara,"No one does! Nevertheless, Bender's gas blaster may be our only hope.",2089
22576,Hermes,"Oh! Wife? What are you doin' with Bender's shiny metal, gas compressor?",2090
22577,LaBarbara,None of your Biz Markie. Wait a second. What's that do wah in your ditty bag?,2090
22578,Hermes,Okay... So we were hot. I stole Amana's freon coil so we could hook it up to Bender's ass and build a cooler.,2090
22579,LaBarbara,"You are no better than me, ya shifty tree skink! How do you live with yourself?",2090
22580,Hermes,"Damn it, woman! You are makin' me highly Selassie.",2090
22581,LaBarbara,"Don't you talk to me that way, you big, hairy Belafonte!",2090
22582,Hermes,"Oh... You cookin' me back bacon. Thank you, woman.",2091
22583,LaBarbara,That's not back bacon! That's your back bakin'!,2091
22584,Hermes,"Oh, no! We overslept.",2091
22585,Amy,The mercury's boiling!,2091
22586,Petunia,Can't breathe... Lungs burnin'...,2091
22587,Fry,My lucky shoe!,2091
22588,Bender,"Goodbye, cruel me!  I learned that from a movie.",2091
22589,Big rock Alien,"I find both genders supremely disappointing. The real reason I administered this bizarre, outer-space test was to teach you to work together! But you couldn't. Thanks to you, I lost my bet with the Borax Kid.",2091
22590,Fry,Never bet against me being stupid.,2091
22591,Big rock Alien,Enough! Your gender differences have kept you from achieving harmony. There is only one way to resolve this conflict.,2091
22592,Fry,Wait. Why didn't that hurt?  My wing-wang's gone!,2091
22593,Leela,My girls!,2091
22594,Bender,My antenna!,2091
22595,Hattie,My kajigger!,2091
22596,Zoidberg,My gonopores! Look it up.,2091
22597,Big rock Alien,I have freed you from the tyranny of gender. Now go in peace. Or actually stay here. I'll go in peace.,2091
22598,Professor Farnsworth,"Good news, nuchachos! The ship is nearly repaired.",2092
22599,Sal,Work goes fasters withouts no secondary sex characteristicses at which to hoot. Now who wants to sing some Christopher Cross songs?,2092
22600,LaBarbara,I do!,2092
22601,Fry,"Look, associates. I made a hammock from our clothing.",2093
22602,Leela,How industrious!,2093
22603,Amy,Do you mind if we sleep with you?,2093
22604,Fry,"I have no opinion.  Well, good night.",2093
22605,Hermes,Everyone got along so well today.,2094
22606,LaBarbara,Yes. This place is like a neutered utopia.  A neutopia!,2094
22607,Hermes,I enjoy humour when no one gets hurt.,2094
22608,LaBarbara,"Your companionship is inoffensive, Hermes.",2094
22609,Hermes,"Likewise. Really, what are we missing out on by not having sex right now?",2094
22610,LaBarbara,Well...,2094
22611,Hermes,Give us back our genitals!,2095
22612,Big rock Alien,"Is that you, Borax Kid? I've got your fifty bucks.  Oh, it's you. Why do you want your genders? You seem happier without them.",2095
22613,LaBarbara,Bein' Human isn't just about bein' happy! It's about lovin' and fightin' and that rasta MacNasty we were doin' last night.  We want that back.,2095
22614,Big rock Alien,Very well. Perhaps it is I who have learned a lesson. Or something.,2095
22615,Bender,Now what?,2096
22616,Big rock Alien,"I have decided, after little thought, to return your genders.",2096
22617,Amy,"Not cool, bro! Our genders are all reversed!",2096
22618,Hattie,"Now I got a what-ya-call-it instead of a kajigger, you stupid what-ya-call-it!",2096
22619,Big rock Alien,Okay. Stop yelling at me! It was an innocent mistake. Allow me to rectify it.,2096
22620,Zapp,I got your distress call and came as quickly as I wanted to. No need to thank me.,2096
22621,Leela,"What's your problem, Holmes? Now we'll be stuck like this forever!",2096
22622,Zapp,"Chill out, dude.  Well, hello from the neck down.",2096
22623,Bender,Thank you for your patronage. We know you have a choice in airlines and you made the wrong one. No refunds!,2097
22624,Hermes,Aren't we going to cuddle?,2098
22625,LaBarbara,"Woman, I'm tired! I'm sorry. It's just... I need my sleep. I got to get up five times a night to play Xbox.",2098
22626,Hermes,"I understand. Womanhood also takes some getting used to. For example, did you know there are more than two feelin's?",2098
22627,LaBarbara,I only need one feelin',2098
22628,Hermes,Your manwich!,2098
22629,LaBarbara,No wonder it's such a mess in there. These bad boys are hard to aim.,2099
22630,Leela,"I hate being a man. I smell bad, my face is scratchy, and the food at those strip clubs is terrible.",2099
22631,Amy,"Crappin' A! Still, I'm sure the women are having an even harder time.",2099
22632,Bender,OMG! Being chicks is so much fun.,2099
22633,Fry,"Now, when I say stupid things, guys all laugh and buy me stuff.",2099
22634,Leela,"What a skank. Anyway, Planet Express is still facing foreclosure. There's no way we can raise enough money to save this company.",2099
22635,Amy,Wait. What about the girly calendar?,2099
22636,Fry,"Well, that won't work, remember? We only have three women on staff—",2099
22637,LaBarbara,"""All female employees must pose nude if requested.""",2099
22638,Leela,And it is requested.,2099
22639,Professor Farnsworth,Let's just hope we can sell enough of these calendars by tomorrow.,2100
22640,Professor Farnsworth,We sold enough of those calendars since yesterday!,2101
22641,Leela,Thank God most of our fans are huge perverts!,2101
22642,Fry,"Who're you, stranger?",2101
22643,Borax Kid,"Well, madam, folks called me the Borax Kid. My friend, the other rock Alien, died without settin' your genitals to right, so I reckon it's up to me to sex you up proper.",2101
22644,Leela,My girls are back!,2101
22645,Fry,Ow! Yay!,2101
22646,Hermes,"So what did you like better, my love? Bein' a man or a woman?",2101
22647,LaBarbara,I don't care what parts I have. As long as they interlock with yours.,2101
22648,Professor Farnsworth,"Ah, marriage. It combines the contentedness of being neutered with the occasional sex of being not.",2101
22649,Borax Kid,"Well, I'd best mosey on down to the landing. Sounds like the feldspar queen is about to set sail. You folks watch your genitals now.  Come on, boy! Giddy up!",2101
22650,Leela,And that's that.,2101
22651,Scruffy,What I miss?,2101
22652,Albert,I got one!,2102
22653,Warden Vogel,"Okay, kids. Put away the dust motes 'til tomorrow.  Today's storyteller is a space captain who grew up right here at the Orphanarium. Welcome back the bedwetter of building D, Turanga Leela!",2102
22654,Leela,"Hi, kids!  What book would you like me to read first?",2102
22655,Albert,We don't got books no more.,2102
22656,Leela,What?,2102
22657,Warden Vogel,"He means any more. Look, sometimes you gotta choose between eatin' and reading.  So they ate the books. Just... Make somethin' up!",2102
22658,Leela,"Make something up? Um... Okay.  Once upon a time, there was a... A...",2102
22659,Sally,Princess?,2102
22660,Leela,"Yes! That!  A... One-eyed princess in a long, flowing... Tank top. And she lived in a magical, one-room...",2102
22661,Sally,Castle?,2102
22662,Leela,"Yeah. If you believe the listing agent. Anyhow, one day, the princess went off to... Uh... Tell a story! And, then, that's exactly what she did do that. And they all lived happily ever after. The end.",2102
22663,Albert,Miss Leela? I have a question!,2102
22664,Leela,"Yes, Albert?",2102
22665,Albert,That story was bad.,2102
22666,Leela,That's not really a question.,2102
22667,Albert,That wasn't really a story.,2102
22668,Leela,But I promise,2102
22669,Sally,Please don't...,2102
22670,Leela,See you soon!,2102
22671,Leela,"I'm sure I've got a great kids' story in me. I just need to think of three of some kind of animal. Concentrate, Leela! Concentrate!  Fry, I'm writing here! Do you have to play that?",2103
22672,Fry,It's the only song I know.,2103
22673,Zoidberg,"Look, friends! I accidentally learned to tap-dance!",2103
22674,Leela,"Zoidberg, I'm trying to—",2103
22675,Hermes,Time for my four-twenty-one daiquiri!,2103
22676,Bender,Guys! Guys! Guess who just got commissioned as a tugboat!,2103
22677,Amy,"Oh, yeah! Pachinko break!",2103
22678,Pachinko machine,Tokyo crazy balls! Yes!,2103
22679,Professor Farnsworth,"Ooh, good, Leela. You're here.  Maybe it's too much albumin because of gravity...",2103
22680,Leela,"Even if I had a pen, I couldn't write under these conditions.  I'm going to some other planet, where I can concentrate.",2103
22681,Professor Farnsworth,"Searing, searing pain that feels as if it were in a vice.",2103
22682,Bender,"Well, that was rude.",2103
22683,Leela,"Warden Vogel, I have a new story for the children.  I'm sure they'll like it more than my last one.",2104
22684,Warden Vogel,"They liked hunger cramps more than your last one. Anyhow, you'll have to wait. The kids are busy right now.",2104
22685,Leela,Oh. Is the organ-harvesting clown here?,2104
22686,Warden Vogel,"Nah. Rusty comes on Tuesdays now. Today, it's the owner of the Tickelodeon Kids Network.",2104
22687,Abner Doubledeal,"Okay, kids.  Get ready to be subjected to our new Fall shows! Mr. Funny Bunny here will gauge your reaction by bombarding your brains with harmless snuggle rays.",2104

22695,Bottomless Boy,"Hurry, Captain!  A skinny kid needs our help!",2104
22696,Captain Mega Meat,Supersize me!,2104
22697,[Cut to,Inside an arena. The crowd is cheering. A brown-haired toddler and a blond toddler approach a crib serving as a ring. The shirt of one of the men in the crowd reads,2104
22698,Male voice #3,"From the ""Rowdy"" Roddy Piper daycare centre in Glasgow, Scotland, it's Extreme Toddler Wrestling!",2104
22699,Abner Doubledeal,"Thanks for the brain scans, kids.  Don't have any children for the next couple of days.",2104
22700,Warden Vogel,"Alright, boys and girls. Enough fun! Your old friend Leela is back with a brand-new story!",2104
22701,Leela,Hi! It's great to be back.  I think you'll enjoy this one.,2104
22702,Sally,Please!  Can't we just get our organs harvested?,2104
22703,Leela,"It's about some cute, little creatures from a land called Rumbledy-Hump.  We're here to make you laugh and think and smile and learn and sing.And laugh and learn and smile and think and other happy things.",2104
22704,Albert,Say more things like that!,2104
22705,Leela,"Okey-doke. One sunny, funny day, there was an unfamiliar visitor in Rumbledy-Hump.",2104
22706,Leela,Although I breathe chlorine.,2104
22707,Sally,Wow! I can't believe you imaginated all that stuff!,2104
22708,Nina,Will you come back again and tell us more stories and also adopt us all?,2104
22709,Leela,Of course I'll tell you more stories.  I'll go think some up right now.,2104
22710,Abner Doubledeal,"Holy moly!  Lady, you don't know me, but my name is Abner Doubledeal.",2104
22711,Leela,Wait! I know you! You're Abner Doubledeal!,2104
22712,Abner Doubledeal,"I brain-scanned those little nose-pickers during your story. And, sister, their enjoyment glands were squirtin' like Broadway roadkill!",2104
22713,Leela,They were?!,2104
22714,Abner Doubledeal,"Say, you seem like a smart mark.  Supercuts coupon.",2104
22715,Leela,Don't I need a degree to write gibberish for toddlers?,2104
22716,Nina,"Come on, Miss Leela!  Don't be a fraidy cat like Feffernoose!",2104
22717,Leela,Okay. I'll do it!  If you just luck out hard enough.,2104
22718,Abner Doubledeal,I'm gonna need that pen back.,2104
22719,Hermes,Working on a real TV show is so exciting! I'm on a mostly natural high!,2105
22720,Amy,These costumes are gonna make it hard to go to the bathroom.,2105
22721,Fry,I'm not havin' any problem.,2105
22722,Abner Doubledeal,"We're shooting in five minutes and this Leela broad hasn't even delivered a script yet! Sweet Zombie Jesus! Like it's not hard enough to make a freakin' TV show for under fifty bucks!  Damn it, I'll call you back, grandma. Nice of you to show up, toots. I mean that sincerely. It's just that I'm in show biz.",2105
22723,Leela,Sorry. I went to my quiet place to write. Here's the script.,2105
22724,Abner Doubledeal,"Argh! You writers make me sick. Nice job on the script, though. Places, everyone.  Okay. Cheap lights. Off-brand camera. And non-union action!",2105
22725,Fry,"I like ice cream. And I like lollipops. And I like you, Princess Num Num.",2105
22726,Amy,Ew! I'm all licky-sticky!,2105
22727,Fry,"I don't understand. When I like something, I lick it. Like this raccoon.",2105
22728,Leela,Doingg! Don't lick things that don't wanna be licked.,2105
22729,Fry,But how do I know what to lick and what not to lick?,2105
22730,Leela,"If it's alive, don't lick it.",2105
22731,Zoidberg,"Like a horse, a turtle, or a cricket.",2105
22732,Bender,I like turtles.,2105
22733,Leela,"So, if you're not sure if it's alive or dead,Poke it with a stick and lick the stick instead.",2105
22734,Fry,Now I get it!,2105
22735,Zoidberg,Ow!,2105
22736,Leela,"Well, that's all for today. But, before we go, let's do everything we just did two more times.",2105
22737,Bender,"Leela, that was great! Even I have to admire the performance of me, Bender!",2105
22738,Amy,"The show looks so cute. Kids'll love it! And it looks so cruddy, their ironic hipster parents will love it.",2105
22739,Leela,"Thanks, guys. But let's be realistic. We all know any TV show that's even slightly good gets cancelled. Sometimes, two or three times.",2105
22740,Abner Doubledeal,Leela! Tomorrow's ratings just came in from the future. We're a hit!,2105
22741,Leela,What?! My show is a hit?!,2105
22742,Abner Doubledeal,"What are you, deaf? It's gonna be bigger than SpongeBot SquareBolts!",2105
22743,SpongeBot SquareBolts,I interfere with pacemakers!,2105
22744,Abner Doubledeal,"Baby, I hope you like drowning in caviar. 'Cause that is how you're gonna die!",2105
22745,Calculon,"Welcome back to the Young People's Choice Awards. In a moment, the award for Outstanding Sext Message. But, first, the nominees for Best New Kids' Show are... Yo Gimme Gimme!, The Adventures of Pit-Bull and Scaredy Squirrel, Dora the Destroyer, and Rumbledy-Hump.",2106
22746,Fry,"I hope you win, Leela.",2106
22747,Leela,"Thanks, Fry. It's nice to have the support of viewers like you.",2106
22748,Fry,I'm the star of the show.,2106
22749,Leela,Shh!,2106
22750,Calculon,And the Slurmie for Best New Kids' Show goes to... Turanga Leela for Rumbledy-Hump!,2106
22751,Female voice,This is Turanga Leela's first nomination and second time in high heels.,2106
22752,Leela,"Wow. I feel so lucky just to have been nominated alongside so many inferior shows. And, to all my young friends at the Orphanarium, thank you for inspiring me to be your hero.",2106
22753,Calculon,Slurm her!,2106
22754,Bender,So wait. You play a high-school student who's also secretly a rock star who's also secretly a massage chair?,2107
22755,Fembot,"No. I play a high-school student who's also secretly a rock star, but, in real life, I'm a massage chair.",2107
22756,Bender,Hmmm. You ever made out with a tugboat?,2107
22757,Leela,"Guys, I didn't have time to mention it up there, but I want each of you to know what an honour it is to work with me.",2107
22758,Hermes,Sweet ego of Montego! Someone build a wind farm in front of her mouth.,2107
22759,Abner Doubledeal,"Leela, I mean this. You're the greatest creative mind since blah, blah, blah-bity, blah. But it's two AM and you still haven't written tomorrow's episode.",2107
22760,Leela,"Well, you can't expect me to write it here, with everyone talking so loudly about how great I am.",2107
22761,Abner Doubledeal,Sorry.,2107
22762,Leela,I'm taking the ship to my quiet place so I can be alone. You non-creatives can catch a bus home.,2107
22763,Fry,Non-creative? Ha! I'll have you know I bedazzle my own underpants.,2107
22764,Bender,"That was a helluva massage. Maybe the best there ever was. Say, where are we? Rumbledy-Hump?! It's real!",2108
22765,Doingg,"I love eating vegetables. Don't you? They're like crunchy, green water.",2108
22766,Garbly,I don't like 'em. They're icky-yucky!,2108
22767,Lady Buggle,"Now, now, Garbly. If we don't eat our vegetables, we won't grow big and strong... Like Feffernoose.",2108
22768,Feffernoose,I have to be big and strong to fight off the monsters. Did somebody say monsters?!,2108
22769,Leela,This will make a great episode. But talk slower. I can't type that fast.,2108
22770,Bender,"Well, well, well. You didn't make up that TV show! You just wrote down what these space twerps said!",2108
22771,Leela,"Oh, hell.",2108
22772,Princess Num Num,Leela said a Rumbledy-Hump no-no!,2108
22773,Humplings,"Sometimes, when we're mad,We say words that are bad.",2108
22774,Humplings,And poo-poo and pee-pee and penis and gay.Those are the ninety-eight words we don't say.,2109
22775,Bender,"My God. You stole all your ideas from those poor, innocent creatures and hogged all the credit?! I underestimated you.",2109
22776,Leela,Wait! I can explain.,2109
22777,Bender,"Nah, don't ruin it. I'm lovin' the hypocrisy. It's like catchin' an evangelist in a whorehouse. That was the best Christmas ever.",2109
22778,Leela,"You know I hate lying. But those orphans were so proud of me, I couldn't bear to let them down.",2109
22779,Bender,Pfff! At least Reverend Pickens had the dignity to jump out the whorehouse window with his pants around his ankles.,2109
22780,Princess Num Num,"Who's your friend, Leela? He sure has a shiny metal bumbledy-boop.",2109
22781,Bender,"Aw, they're so cute and harmless. No wonder you feel safe rippin' off their act.",2109
22782,Leela,Bender! I feel bad enough already.,2109
22783,Bender,"I'm just messin' with ya. I love that you're gettin' rich off of them. 'Cause, now, I can get rich off of you!",2109
22784,Leela,"Oh, Lord.",2109
22785,Bender,"From now on, you give me half the gross or I'll blow your cover.",2109
22786,Leela,"Fine. You'll get your cut. I don't really care about the money, anyway. I just wanna show those poor, disadvantaged orphans that they can succeed in life.",2109
22787,Bender,Ugh. You are the worst kind of rich person.,2109
22788,Leela,Be it parsnips or peppers or kale or zucchini.,2110
22789,Fry,I like to relax with a spinach martini.,2110
22790,Bender,A-gurgle bufwoozle didoodi houdini.,2110
22791,All,'Cause we love our vegetables.,2110
22792,Abner Doubledeal,"And... Cut! That's a wrap, everybody. Ten-minute break, then we shoot season three.",2110
22793,Fry,"Leela, you may have become a Lady Gaga-esque fame hag, but you sure cheered up those orphans. Nice job.",2110
22794,Warden Vogel,Thanks so much for inviting us to the taping. The kids haven't been this excited since food day!,2110
22795,Leela,"Aw, thanks. They're my inspiration.",2110
22796,Bender,"But not your only inspiration. Am I right, Leels?",2110
22797,Albert,Is somebody standing on me?,2110
22798,Bender,I do love inconveniencing the underclass.,2110
22799,Warden Vogel,"Well, we'll be on our way. After we dig through your trash for aluminum. Okay, kids. Delta pattern. Go! Go! Go!",2110
22800,Sally,Miss Leela?,2110
22801,Leela,"Yes, Sally?",2110
22802,Sally,"I wanna show you the story I made up. That's Gum Drop, Sticky, Candy Corn, Sour Ball, and Jujube. They're brothers and sisters and they live in Butterscotch Hollow.",2110
22803,Leela,"Sally, that's wonderful. You came up with that yourself? Out of thin air? How?",2110
22804,Sally,"You were an orphan and now you're the best writer ever, so I knew I could write too. Thank you for being my hero.",2110
22805,Leela,I can't do this any more.,2110
22806,Professor Farnsworth,I don't blame you. Having to wear a costume made from a hollowed-out walrus...,2110
22807,Leela,"Everyone, I have a confession. I, Turanga Leela, winner of a Young People's Choice Award, a Peabody Jr, and two Training Emmys, am not what I appear to be. There's something I need to show you.",2110
22808,Bender,Uh-oh.,2110
22809,Leela,"Continuing my confession, this is the hardest thing I've ever done.",2111
22810,Sally,Harder than creating the bestest show in the world?,2111
22811,Leela,I didn't create anything. I stole it.,2111
22812,Bender,Stealin' is a form of creativity!,2111
22813,Leela,"No, it isn't. Guys! Come on out!",2111
22814,Abner Doubledeal,Holy moly again.,2111
22815,Lady Buggle,"Oh, hello, Leela. I was just telling my friends how they shouldn't eat food off the floor. Should we sing a song about it?",2111
22816,Fry,"Yes, please!",2111
22817,Leela,"No need, Lady Buggle.",2111
22818,Abner Doubledeal,"Say, what's goin' on here?",2111
22819,Leela,This planet is the real Rumbledy-Hump. And these creatures are the real Humplings. All I did was write down their adorably repetitious hijinks.,2111
22820,Sally,You lied? Like Doingg did when he stole Garbly's pet pinecone?,2111
22821,Doingg,You told them about that?,2111
22822,Leela,I should've told the truth right away. These simply prairie folk have a simple prairie-ish life here. And I was wrong to exploit it for profit.,2111
22823,Lady Buggle,I'm as sad as an upside-down smile.,2111
22824,Leela,You mean a frown?,2111
22825,Lady Buggle,We didn't have a word for it... Until now.,2111
22826,Amy,To think I put on an unflattering cupcake costume for you!,2111
22827,Fry,To think I borrowed money from you!,2111
22828,Albert,I was gonna ask you to marry me.,2111
22829,Sally,"I guess, if you can't make up stories, I can't neither.",2111
22830,Leela,I deserve this. And more. Keep it coming!,2111
22831,Abner Doubledeal,"Wait a second. As a big Hollywood TV producer, I think I know how to remedy this ethical lapse.",2111
22832,Lady Buggle,So if you don't want a tapeworm or intestinal bug...,2111
22833,Humplings,Don't eat pastrami that fell on the rug.,2111
22834,Abner Doubledeal,And... Cut! Ta-da! We got us a reality show! No writers. No actors. No problem.,2111
22835,Leela,"Doubledeal, this is disgraceful! You can't just rip off their real lives and put it on TV!",2111
22836,Abner Doubledeal,Wha? Who said anything about rippin' them off?,2111
22837,Leela,I did!,2111
22838,Abner Doubledeal,"I'm payin' 'em. Gather 'round, gang. Here're your pay checks.",2111
22839,Garbly,I can finally afford my speech therapy!,2111
22840,Feffernoose,And the health plan covers my generic Prozac!,2111
22841,Lady Buggle,"Electricity, plumbing... Our lives are a jillion times better. And it's all thanks to you, Leela.",2111
22842,Leela,Don't thank me! I should be punished! I've corrupted you and taught the orphans a terrible lesson.,2111
22843,Warden Vogel,What orphans?! The kids were all adopted!,2111
22844,Leela,They were?! By who?!,2111
22845,Abner Doubledeal,"Come on, kids. Let's get this place cleaned up for the next episode. Albert, pick up that pastrami and put it back on the craft services table.",2111
22846,Albert,"You're the boss, Daddy.",2111
22847,Leela,"Oh, God! What have I done?!",2111
22848,Nina,You've given us a new father and a full-time job! Which is more than most kids have!,2111
22849,Leela,But—,2111
22850,Sally,"We love it here, Miss Leela. This is the funnest planet in the whole world!",2111
22851,Leela,"Don't hug me! I've done a horrible thing! For God's sakes, somebody teach me a lesson!",2111
22852,Orphans and Humplings,We love Leela!,2111
22853,Leela,No!,2111
22854,Fry,"Run, Leela! They're bouncing right at us!",2112
22855,Bender,So... Anybody hungry?,2112
22856,Fry,I could stuff myself.,2112
22857,Leela,I'll use that free app that tells you what restaurants you're near.,2112
22858,Fry,You mean the window?,2112
22859,Leela,Yes.,2112
22860,Lrrr,"I am Lrrr, ruler of the planet Omicron Persei 8! I demand extra dipping sauce!",2112
22861,Teenaged Alien,How many?,2112
22862,Lrrr,Uh... Two.,2112
22863,Fishy Joe,Welcome to Fishy Joe's. Today is Stroganoff Thursday. We are currently out of the following menu items.,2112
22864,Female voice,Stroganoff.,2112
22865,Teenaged Alien,May I take your order?,2112
22866,Fry,I'll have the Stroganoff.,2112
22867,Teenaged Alien,Okay.,2112
22868,Bender,"Yeah, uh, gimme the fried spaghetti dinner breakfast pocket for lunch an', uh, a big bucket o' mixed sodas.",2112
22869,Teenaged Alien,One kids meal. Got it.,2112
22870,Leela,Huh. Buggalo tots?,2112
22871,Leela,What exactly are those made of?,2112
22872,Teenaged Alien,You got a warrant?,2112
22873,Leela,I'll just have something from the lite menu. How about the gardener lover's salad?,2112
22874,Teenaged Alien,What kinda cheese fillin' you want in that?,2112
22875,Leela,Ugh! Just gimme the fruit cup!,2112
22876,Teenaged Alien,Okey-doke. What kinda cheese fillin' you want in that?,2112
22877,Leela,"Oh, God! Fruit is spelled F-R-O-O-T. And it's got quotation marks around it.",2112
22878,Fry,Mmm. There's nothin' wrong with a little fast food once or twice a meal. Heart... Attack! I'm fine.,2112
22879,Leela,"Oh! I got a bone in my fruit! That's it. From now on, we're not eating anything unless we know what it is an' where it's from. We're going to the local farmers market.",2112
22880,Bender,"Aw, mom! Do we hafta?!",2112
22881,Leela,This is what I'm talkin' about! See all the dirt an' earwigs? That's the sign of healthy food.,2112
22882,Hydroponic farmer,You think that's healthy? Try this. I found it growin' at the bottom of my hamper.,2112
22883,Leela,Mmm! So fresh an' musty!,2112
22884,Bulb,It's what I do.,2112
22885,Thog,"Hello, tiny man. You want sample small-batch Amazonian maple syrup?",2112
22886,Fry,Sure. That's the kinda sap I like.,2112
22887,Thog,You the kind of sap I like.,2112
22888,Fry,I'm scaroused!,2112
22889,Bender,"Zuban tobacco?! The richest, most obnoxious kind! Listen, pal. I'm lookin' for a versatile smoke. One that's equally good in a crowded elevator or an audience with the Pope.",2112
22890,Moustached Alien,"Forget the Pope, my friend. Smoke one of these and God himself will ask to be seated far away from you.",2112
22891,Bender,Ooh!,2112
22892,Leela,Heirloom eggs?! That's so life-affirming! I'll bet you run your own hatchery. Just you and your wife... Matilda.,2112
22893,Brown-haired man,"No, ma'am. Matilda an' I gather them eggs in the forest. And Matilda's really more of a mongoose than a wife.",2112
22894,Leela,You're a lucky man. But are they way more expensive than regular eggs?,2112
22895,Brown-haired Man,Way more.,2112
22896,Leela,Ooh! I'll take a dozen.,2112
22897,Professor Farnsworth,Wha?! You're not my breakfast friends! What are you doing here?!,2113
22898,Amy,"Leela blackmailed us all into eating healthy, organic food.",2113
22899,Professor Farnsworth,Blackmail? What does she have on you?,2113
22900,Hermes,"As long as we eat 'er filthy scrambled eggs, you'll never find out.",2113
22901,Leela,"They're not filthy! They're wholesome, fertile, and fresh from the forest floor. There's some filth.",2113
22902,Fry,FERTILE? What does that mean?,2113
22903,Zoidberg,"It means it'll hatch into a tiny, little infant creature. Unless we cook it first. Hey, Leela! Hurry up with those scrambled infants!",2113
22904,Fry,"What?! That's horrifying! Zoidberg, you're an in-Human monster.",2113
22905,Zoidberg,What are you? My driver's license?,2113
22906,Fry,"Eating a sweet, innocent chick before it's even hatched?! Oh-ho-ho-ho, no, you won'tn't! I refuse to eat an unborn animal! I'm gonna keep this egg safe and warm and secure. Until it hatches out into the world. And then I'm gonna eat it!",2113
22907,Leela,Should we turn on the TV?,2114
22908,Hermes,Nah.,2114
22909,Fry,"Bender, d'you mind? I'm roosting.",2114
22910,Bender,I'm considerin' buyin' a yacht to house my Thoroughbreds. How d'you expect me to do that without smokin' a cigar?,2114
22911,Fry,Think of the unborn embryo!,2114
22912,Bender,That's what I'm gonna call the yacht. Stop pickin' me! Whoa!,2114
22913,Fry,"Hey! Leggo my egg-o, crab-o!",2114
22914,Hermes,"Stop it, Fry! That's sexual harassment!",2114
22915,Zoidberg,"Yeah, come down off your round, white pulpit! You're just gonna eat that thing, anyway!",2114
22916,Fry,"I was, but you can't sit on something for a week without falling in love with it. Whoever's in here deserves a chance at life. A chance to blossom into a beautiful young man. Like I did as a baby. And so I make this solemn vow... To do everything I can to make sure this wonderful, innocent creature enters this world happy, healthy, an'— All yours, Zoidberg.",2114
22917,Bender,"Aw! Look at the cute, little— I was gonna go yachting in those feet!",2114
22918,Leela,"Relax, you babies. It's no different from stomping a puppy.",2115
22919,Fry,Everyone stop! He's not gonna hurt you.,2115
22920,Bender,I'm standin' in a pool of my own feet!,2115
22921,Hermes,Bender's right! Kill it before someone names it!,2115
22922,Fry,No! Mr. Peppy just wants to be our friend.,2115
22923,Hermes,Oy!,2115
22924,Fry,Look,2115
22925,Amy,That's what we said about Zoidberg and look what that got us.,2115
22926,Zoidberg,Amy has a point.,2115
22927,Fry,Mr. Peppy's not like Zoidberg. He's my friend.,2115
22928,Zoidberg,Aw!,2115
22929,Calculon,Where to... Adulterers?,2116
22930,Monique,Calculon?! Then it wasn't your body they found in the harbor after the bomb went off.,2116
22931,Calculon,What bomb?,2116
22932,Bender,"It takes more than that to surprise me, Bender.  Dumb jerk. Come on! Get the ball.",2116
22933,Hermes,Sweet freak of Mozambique! That thing's colossal! It's gonna kill us all!,2116
22934,Amy,It's so huge! How big does one o' those things get?!,2116
22935,Fry,"Well, that depends on what one o' those things is. That seems like a fact worth knowing.",2116
22936,Professor Farnsworth,"Good, startling news, everyone!",2116
22937,Professor Farnsworth,I found a description of the creature in this medieval monster manual. Just as I feared. Attack type J.,2116
22938,Amy,No!  No!,2116
22939,Professor Farnsworth,"It kills its prey by sucking out the skeleton, leaving nothing but a puddle of flesh.",2116
22940,Amy,Ew!,2116
22941,Leela,Ugh!,2116
22942,Bender,Ew!,2116
22943,Professor Farnsworth,"Hence the Latin name bonus vampirus. Or, as you non-Catholics would say, the bone vampire!",2116
22944,Zoidberg,Dios mío.,2116
22945,Fry,That's ridiculous. Mr. Peppy doesn't eat bones. I raised 'im on a simple diet o' Brussels sprouts an' mixed soda.,2116
22946,Hermes,At least there's only one of 'em. The good news is they can't start breedin'.,2116
22947,Professor Farnsworth,"The bad news, everyone, is the beast reproduces asexually. A single bone vampire, left alone with some quiet music and some bone-vampire porn, could produce dozens of deadly offspring.",2116
22948,Zoidberg,That lucky bastard. I say kill it!,2116
22949,Fry,But it loves me! And I love it.,2116
22950,Zoidberg,Kill 'em both!,2116
22951,Leela,Killing them seems like a hassle. Can't we just set it free to live with its own kind?,2116
22952,Professor Farnsworth,"Poor, ignorant Leela. The bone vampire is now extinct on its home planet.",2116
22953,Leela,That's perfect! We can reintroduce it to the wild and repopulate the species!,2116
22954,Fry,Yeah! Let's do those Leela things.,2116
22955,Fry,"Well, buddy, how d'ya like your new home? See? He's happy already.",2117
22956,Hermes,"That thing doesn't have emotions, Fry. Its brain is the size of a walnut.",2117
22957,Fry,"So are walnuts and they're delicious. I'll miss you, Mr. Peppy. But you'll be happier here. So... Go on. Go. Goodbye, Mr. Peppy. Come on, man. Don't do this. Go on now. I mean it. Don't make this any harder than it has to be. It's time to let go! Ow! Thanks, Leela. He just needed a little extra push.",2117
22958,Leela,"Come on, Fry. Let's go home an'—",2117
22959,Bender,"Hold up! There's alcohol around here somewhere. My Tanqueray-dar is goin' crazy. Aha-ha! Thought you could get away from me, huh? You lose again, you stupid intoxicant!",2117
22960,Zoidberg,We're not from around here. Hello!,2118
22961,Man #1,,2118
22962,Hermes,"Excuse me, but we're guests on your planet. Speak English!",2118
22963,Man #2,"Behave yourselves, gents. Off-worlders best be welcome here. Especially if we're trying to get the Olympics. May I buy you a drink? We don't get a lot of pretty faces around here.",2118
22964,Leela,Uh... Sure. But I'm driving. I'll just have the smallest whisky you've got.,2118
22965,Man #2,A small aquarium o' whisky for the busty lass!,2118
22966,Leela,Thanks. I suppose I should know your name if I'm gonna be drinking ten gallons of alcohol with you.,2118
22967,Man #2,McZongo. Angus McZongo. Major Angus McZongo. Handsome Major Angus McZongo. Esquire.,2118
22968,Leela,Ooh! Handsome and esquire. I'm Turanga Leela. My crew an' I are from Earth.,2118
22969,Angus McZongo,So what brings you folks here to Doohan 6?,2118
22970,Amy,We just released an endangered animal back into the wild. A bone vampire!,2118
22971,Hermes,No need to thank us. Your shocked stares of gratitude say it all.,2118
22972,Angus McZongo,Dear God. You brought back the bone vampire?! The damn things wreaked bloody havoc on our livestock for centuries!,2118
22973,Woman,"Aye! Until McZongo 'ere shot 'em all into extinction, 'e did.",2118
22974,Man #3,"Now we've got more livestock than we can slaughter. Oh, aye. 'Tis a Bonnie time to be an ignorant villager.",2118
22975,Man #4,We kinna have no murderin' bone vampires back 'ere!,2118
22976,Man #3,Kill it afore it puts a bun in its own oven and repopulates the bleedin' planet!,2118
22977,Fry,No!,2118
22978,Angus McZongo,Angus is right.,2118
22979,Hermes,I thought you were named Angus.,2118
22980,Man #1,We're all named Angus!,2118
22981,Fry,Please! Mr. Peppy won't attack your livestock. He's a vegetarian and 'e's not even preachy about it!,2118
22982,Angus McZongo,"Poppycock. Once he gets the smell o' bones, there'll be no stoppin' 'im. Tonight, Mr. Peppy must die.",2118
22983,Leela,"Angus, wait. My strictly platonic friend is right. At least wait a few days before you decide to kill it.",2118
22984,Angus McZongo,"The last time I hesitated, a bone vampire snicked out me left shin.",2118
22985,Leela,Please! Just a few days.,2118
22986,Angus McZongo,"Well, 'twould give us a chance to get to know each other. The beast lives! For now.",2118
22987,Leela,"Thank you, Angus.",2118
22988,Men,You're welcome!,2118
22989,Fry,I don't trust that McZongo. Maybe I should go keep an eye on Mr. Peppy.,2119
22990,Leela,Don't worry about McZongo. He an' I are having brunch tomorrow. I'm thinking of wearing this.,2119
22991,Fry,It's nice! But there's still somethin' I don't like about that guy. My dad always said you could tell a lot about a man by the rigidity of 'is shins.,2119
22992,Zoidberg,What is?!,2119
22993,Man #1,"UNKNOWN, Gryffindor, Slytherin an' Hufflepuff! It killed Little Angus!",2119
22994,Professor Farnsworth,They're all dead! And their bones are gone! This was no accident.,2119
22995,Angus McZongo,"Still think your Mr. Peppy is harmless, Fry?",2119
22996,Fry,"He wouldn't do this in our sleep. He would not, could not to a sheep.",2119
22997,Angus McZongo,The deal is off! The beast must die!,2119
22998,Bender,Ooh! Pimpy!,2119
22999,Fry,What are we supposed to do? Just sit here and wait for Mr. Peppy to be killed?,2119
23000,Bender,Sounds like a plan! Guess I'll pass the time by lightin' up an El Jerko!,2119
23001,Leela,Okay! That's it! I need some air.,2119
23002,Leela,"Who's there? Hermes, is this one o' your zany practical jokes?",2119
23003,Fry,"Leela, are you okay? Did you drink too many aquaria?",2119
23004,Hermes,Look! The bone vampire!,2119
23005,Leela,Mr. Peppy attacked me. Quick! Count my bones. There should be two-hundred-and-five!,2119
23006,Leela,Okay. That's better. Keep 'em comin'!,2119
23007,Professor Farnsworth,"I'm sorry, Fry, but no vegetarian could've done this.",2119
23008,Fry,"I know. An', as much as I love Mr. Peppy, I love Leela more. He has to be... Put down.",2119
23009,Amy,"Aw, don't feel bad. Major McZongo's an experienced hunter. He'll blow Mr. Peppy's head off as painlessly as possible.",2119
23010,Fry,"No! Not McZongo! If anyone's gonna kill Mr. Peppy, it should be me.",2119
23011,Zoidberg,"Fry, I know you're upset right now, but I hope you'll consider donating the body to science dinner.",2119
23012,Fry,"Here, Mr. Peppy. Mmm. Lovely bones.",2120
23013,Hermes,We've been walkin' for hours. I hope we can find our way back.,2120
23014,Amy,Don't worry. I left a trail of bread crumbs.,2120
23015,Bender,An' I left a trail of cigars!,2120
23016,Leela,"You don't have to do this, Fry. Mr. Peppy just gave me a little love concussion.",2120
23017,Fry,"Thanks, Leela, but I have no choice. I can't let my monstruous deboner get anywhere near you.",2120
23018,Hermes,There it is!,2120
23019,Fry,"Well, this is it. You guys wait here. This is gonna kill him more than it does me. Goodbye, boy. I'll think of you whenever I sit on something round.",2120
23020,Amy,What's happening?! Did you kill it?!,2120
23021,Mr. Peppy,The bloody idiot bloody-shot me! I'm all bloody-bloody!,2120
23022,Bender,Wha?!,2120
23023,Fry,Mr. Peppy?! Bullets make you talk?!,2120
23024,Bender,That's not Mr. Peppy!,2120
23025,Amy,Jinkies! He Scooby-Doo-ed us!,2120
23026,Leela,"Why, Major McZongo? Why?",2120
23027,Angus McZongo,"Oh, it's been thirty years since last I killed a bone vampire. The villagers dinna idolise me like they used to.",2120
23028,Amy,You seem pretty popular at the pub.,2120
23029,Angus McZongo,I work there as a greeter! Your beast was my chance to be a hero again. But the damn thing was a vegetarian! So I slaughtered the sheep meself.,2120
23030,Leela,But why did you attack me?,2120
23031,Angus McZongo,"So I could impress you by seeking revenge on the creature. Us greeters don't get a lot of action. On paper, it seemed like a win-win situation.",2120
23032,Professor Farnsworth,"Do you realise what this means, Fry?! Your pet's not dangerous after all!",2120
23033,Fry,"I told ya! Mr. Peppy's a lover, not a fighter. Like Dwayne ""The Rock"" ""The Tooth Fairy"" Johnson.",2120
23034,Zoidberg,UNKNOWN! Hey. What's that bone-sucking sound?,2120
23035,Fry,It's Mr. Peppy! I'd know 'im anywhere.,2120
23036,Leela,"Huh. So, apparently, Major McZongo and Mr. Peppy were each doing about half the sheep killing.",2120
23037,Fry,"Why, Mr. Peppy? Why? Ooh. That tickles. Now I really do have to kill you.",2120
23038,Man #3,"Wait! Don't shoot. The beast is a godsend. Like I said, we've more livestock than we can slaughter. But, thanks to this ravenous bogle, that's nae more a problem.",2120
23039,Man #5,"Angus is right. The cursed thing even debones 'em. Which is perfect for today's fast-paced, lazy consumer.",2120
23040,Man #1,"Dersu Uzala, Yojimbo, Rashomon! The beast must live!",2120
23041,Leela,"You know what the best part is? From now on, whenever we're eating fresh, organic space meat, we'll know exactly where it comes from.",2120
23042,Fry,"One bucket o' double-friend, triple-salted, boneless sheep tots, please.",2121
23043,Teenaged Alien,What kinda cheese fillin' you want in that?,2121
23044,Fry,All kinds.,2121

23049,Professor Farnsworth,"Ta-da!  And, just recently, I learned of a modern-day Farnsworth, who invented the anti-senility truss.",2122
23050,Leela,"That's you, Professor.",2122
23051,Professor Farnsworth,"Wha?!  Ah, yes. The Farnsworths boast a proud and distinguished lineage. No wormy fruit on this tree.",2122
23052,Amy,What about Fry?  Isn't he your distant uncle?,2122
23053,Professor Farnsworth,"Very distant. Not a true Farnsworth, mind you.  He's way over here on this filthy branch riddled with fungus and dung beetles.",2122
23054,Fry,What's with the seventeen dung beetles?,2122
23055,Hermes,"Well, it's six o'clock.  I guess we'll have to deliver that Human heart tomorrow. Good work, people!",2122
23056,Bender,"Woohoo! Time to go clubbin'.  Baby seals, here I come.",2122
23057,Fry,Guess I better head over to my night job.,2122
23058,Leela,You have a night job?,2122
23059,Fry,"Yup. It's exhausting, but I need the extra money to buy coffee so I can stay awake for my night job.",2122

23442,Fry,So what's the catch?,2148
23443,Professor Farnsworth,"The vaccine requires the original, unmutated, 20th-century cold virus. So I need to grind you into a paste.",2148
23444,Leela,"Professor, no!",2148
23445,Fry,"It's okay, Leela. This is all my fault, sort of. If this will save you, then, please, turn me into a virus milkshake.",2148
23446,Professor Farnsworth,He consented!  You all heard it!,2148
23447,[Flashback,Fry's school's gymnasium. A banner reading,2148

23449,Fry,"Jeez!  Walk much, Gedgie?!",2148
23450,Josh Gedgie,Absurd. You really think your guinea pig could survive in the vacuum of space?,2148

23452,Josh Gedgie,"My experiment measures the effects of microgravity of the propagation of the common cold virus in an anaerobic environment; i.e., space.  Impressed?",2148

23454,Fry,"Hey, wait a second!  I know where you can get some 20th-century cold virus without killing me!",2148
23455,Professor Farnsworth,"Hush, lad.  I'm totally in the zone.",2148
23456,Fry,We just 'ave to find the Nerd Search '88 satellite!,2148

23470,Leela,Hmmm. All ancient satellites were swept up as space junk in 2113.  I'm Facebooking right now.,2148
23471,Professor Farnsworth,"Aha!  That satellite was scuttled on Enceladus, Saturn's main dump moon!",2148
23472,Fry,Let's dump it up!,2148
23473,Leela,This is the exact location of the dump.  But there's nothing here.,2149
23474,Bender,Can we please go home an' die now?,2149
23475,Professor Farnsworth,I'm with Bender.  Whatever was here's been covered by centuries of ice buildup.,2149
23476,Fry,"No!  Remember the code of the ice. Thin an' crispy, way too risky.",2149
23477,Leela,I found a satellite!,2149

23489,Fry,"Good thing Gedgie won. My dumb experiment wouldn't've lasted an hour in space, let alone a thousand years. Besides, Buzz Aldrin ran over my guinea pig in the parking lot.",2149

23699,Bender,"I move for a mistrial on grounds of double jeopardy. Cubert Farnsworth cannot be tried twice for the same crime! Cubert is the Professor's clone. Ergo, they are legally the same person.

24670,Hermes,There will be no noodles until the operation is complete.,2242
24671,Farnsworth,You can't force me to operate.,2242
24672,Hermes,"Maybe not, but perhaps I can encourage you with my encouragement drill.",2242
24673,Zoidberg,Wait. I'll perform the surgery.,2242
24674,Zoidberg,"It's true, old friend. My claws are too clumsy for such delicate work.",2242
24675,Little Hermes,"""But mine aren't.""",2242
24676,Amy,Does anyone else find it freaky that Zoidberg is singing harmony with himself?,2242
24677,Fry,"Oh, loosen up, Amy.",2242
24678,"My condolences, Labarbara.I hope you find some comfort in staring at this throbbing mass of nerve tissue.","Oh, he's gone! Oh, Zoidberg, what have you done?",2242
24679,Zoidberg,I'll tell you what I've done. I've brought your husband back.,2242
24680,Hermes,"Wife, son, I am so sorry. Once I started upgrading myself, I lost all control. But I see now that if you can't be man enough with your own parts, no amount of machinery will help.",2242
24681,Hermes,"In the end, all his implants were no match for my wife's reckless seasoning.",2242
24682,LaBarbara,"Now, husband, don't you think you owe Zoidberg a thank-you for saving you from yourself?",2242
24683,Hermes,But I hate him.,2242
24684,LaBarbara,"Honey, we all do. But fair is fair.",2242
24685,Zoidberg,"Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. I'll be here forever.",2242
24686,Amy,He's doing it again.,2242
24687,Leela,Ugh! Fry! That's disgusting!,2242
24688,Fry,What?,2242
24689,Leela,You double-dipped! Geez.,2242
24690,Farnsworth,"Crew, you're working too hard.",2242
24691,Bender,Tell me about it.,2242
24692,Farnsworth,"For once, I thought it might be nice to do something in a social setting Finally get to know each other. Why, I don't even know half your names! You, boy. What do they call you?",2242
24693,Fry,Most folks just call me orange Joe.,2242
24694,Amy,"So, Professor, where are we gonna go?",2242
24695,Farnsworth,"It's July, right? Let's wait three months and go to Oktoberfest!",2242
24696,Fry,Bring on the beer! And the scantily-clad barmaids! And the more beer!,2242
24697,Fry,Hey! I don't smell Bavarian-style vomit. Where's Oktoberfest?,2242
24698,Amy,"This is Oktoberfest - the world's most sophisticated exhibition of German food, drink, and culture.Exquisite.Care for another, sir? No, I wouldn't want to ruin my Oktoberfest by becoming intoxicated.Fry",2242
24699,Leela,"Fry, quiet. Oktoberfest is a classy celebration of how far humans have evolved. You need to be on your best behavior.",2242
24700,Fry,"No chance! You can all act like Jersey shore socialites, but at least Bender will party with me. Right, buddy?",2242
24701,Bender,"Whoa, whoa, whoa! I enjoy partying as much as the next fellow, but this is Oktoberfest.Good day, sir!",2242
24702,Fry,Ach du freakin' lieber!,2242
24703,Bender,"A sausage contest, eh? Sounds like fun on a bun! Shut up! I said it first!",2242
24704,Elzar,"Bam! Also, ow.",2242
24705,Bender,"Oh, my God, it's celebrity chef Elzar! Hey, Elzar, I've just recently started always having dreamt of being a sausage-making champion. Can I get in on this?",2242
24706,Elzar,"Sure, I don't care. You bring your ingredients?",2242
24707,Bender,You bet!,2242
24708,Elzar,"Hold on there, chief. Regular old pork ain't gonna win this thing. You gotta get innovative with your meat. See chef Fritz over there? He's only using the choicest cuts of hummingbird. Murakami-San got his hands on a nice rack of angel wings. Gonna grind 'em up into heavenwurst. And me? I'm making my spice-weaseled bratwurst outta pork.",2242
24709,Bender,So you are using pork!,2242
24710,Elzar,"Pork that's been aged for 3,000 years! Bam!",2242
24711,Bender,"Aw, man! I can't beat that with a Craigslist pig. Sorry, Grundy. I'll have to kill you later for some other reason.",2242
24712,Leela,Sit up straight! The countess Von Luftballon is watching.,2242
24713,Fry,"Man, all the fun has been taken out of this once-noble barf-a-palooza.",2242
24714,Leela,You just say that because you're primitive. People in your day were backwards and crude.,2242
24715,Fry,"Well, at least we were hammered! Oh, I'm as thirsty as a drunk. Where do all these child-sized beers come from?",2242
24716,Hermes,See that magnificent heavily guarded cask? All the beer's in there.,2242
24717,Fry,Not all the beer.,2242
24718,Fry,Yay! Whoo-hoo! Fahrvergnügen! Kaiser permanente! Fru frusen gladje!,2242
24719,Leela,Fry! You're embarrassing us!,2242
24720,Fry,"I don't care! I'm finally having fun! Hey, come on, you keister-meisters! Eins, zwei, drei, vier! Lift your Stein and drink your beer!",2242
24721,Countess von Luftballon,Ich bin I never!,2242
24722,Fry,"Whoa! Even with harps, that's still the famous Oktoberfest chicken dance!  Oh, I almost forgot!  Get das Booty up here, Leela! I brought his-and-her chicken hats!",2242
24723,Leela,"Okay, that's it. You are a boorish, primitive Neanderthal!,?poem>Fry",2242
24724,Leela,Yes. And I've had enough! I'm breaking up with you!,2242
24725,Fry,"We were going out?! Whoo! I mean, nooo!",2242
24726,Leela,"And keep your stupid chicken hat, too!",2242
24727,Fry,"and-and the worst part is, I had to have the breakup sex by myself!",2242
24728,Bender,"Fry, some of us have real problems. I just learned there are people with fancier sausage meats than me!",2242
24729,Fry,"I hate future Oktoberfest! It's supposed to be beer and bratwurst, not breakups and...boring thing!German narrator",2242
24730,Bender,"Wait a minute! Mammoth meat aged for 30,000 years? Prize-winning sausage meat, here I come!",2242
24731,Fry,I didn't know this ship had a mammoth detector.,2242
24732,Bender,"You're drunk, Fry. This is the elephant detector. I just set it to big and woolly.",2242
24733,Fry,"Uh, Bender? I smell burning tusk.",2242
24734,Bender,That's probably it. Kill the engine.,2242
24735,Bender,"Shut up, judge, I know it.",2242
24736,Leela,I ate Fry! I broke up with my boyfriend and then I ate him!,2242
24737,Farnsworth,"Oh, now, now, we've all been there.",2242
24738,Leela,The pain and guilt are too much! I can't go on knowing what I've done!,2242
24739,Leela,Can you really remove all my memories of Fry?,2242
24740,Annie,"Oh, they'll still be there, hon. I'm just gonna snip the links between them and your conscious brain. Like this one here",2242
24741,Leela,He thought he recognized one of the monkeys! What was I crying about?,2242
24742,Annie,"Oh, we were just cuttin' onions, honey. Let's keep going. ""Fry sits on a pie. Fry finds popcorn in his belly button. You eat a sausage made of Fry. Fry gives you a chicken hat""...aw, that's sweet.",2242
24743,Leela,"Good morning! Geez, who died?",2242
24744,Leela,I don't know how Bender and I do all this work by ourselves. Maybe we should hire a delivery boy.,2242
24745,Bender,You mean like  Fry?,2242
24746,Amy,"Bender, shh! We have to be careful not to remind her!",2242
24747,Bender,What about my feelings? Fry was my best friend And now he's dead!,2242
24748,Hermes,"Bender's a jerk, but he's right. We've all got to accept that Fry is gone forever.",2242
24749,"Whoa Where happened? What am I? Sausage is great, sausage is great ♪Sausage, sausage, sausage ♪ Whew! That was close.  Whew!","Help! Boy trapped in ice! Oh, thank you, thank you.     How you get frozen? Oh, I don't know.I think I whanged my head pretty bad. Look normal to me.The last thing I remember is losing all my memories.Who am I, one of you? Me think so.Anyone dumb enough get stuck in ice probably neanderthal.",2242
24750,Fry,"Neanderthal? Yeah, I think somebody called me that.",2242
24751,"I'm kind of chilly.I don't suppose you have a  Ooh, still warm! So, what's this delivery to McPluto? and French frr agments of not potatoes.Fragments of not potatoes? Yep.They get a big shipment every fri Saturday! What's this?  Oh, it's some kind of chicken hat! It's cute.So why does it make me feel I don't know sad?     Why you stare at prehistoric pig butt? Because it makes me feel happy and confused and wistful and sad.All neanderthal sad.It in our nature.Why? It all start 30,000 year ago, in fertile neander valley.Gugg","Life for our ancestors peaceful until homo sapiens arrive.We suggest interbreed, become one big happy species.But they treat us like second-class hominid.They drive us from valley, and we end up living here, in isolated crevice.We figure, ""whatever."" But then we get trapped by encroaching ice age.Now we sealed in, under sky of ice.",2242
24752,Fry,So my sadness makes perfect sense. And I do have vague memories of people refusing to breed with me.,2242
24753,Scruffy,"A raven's brought word for you, sir.",2242
24754,Bender,"Guys, guys! My sausage made the finals at Oktoberfest! We gotta go back for the closing ceremony!",2242
24755,Fry,"But, chief, this means we're not trapped any more! It's our chance to take back the outside world from those stuck-up homo sapiens with their tools and their pants and such. My fellow big-brows! Are you with me?",2242
24756,Amy,"You've been staring at that pumpkin for like, five seconds. What's up?",2242
24757,Leela,It's...it's something about the color.,2242
24758,Farnsworth,"Oh, boo-hoo. Why are you crying now, you depressed lunatic?",2242
24759,Leela,I don't know. I should be happy. Bender's sausage just won third place.,2242
24760,Bender,Third place? This is the greatest injustice Germany has ever committed!,2242
24761,Zapp Brannigan,"Ah, Leela, we meet again. But this time I'm the one criticizing the sausage.",2242
24762,Hermes,"Dear God, look at those hairy elephantes!",2242
24763,Fry,Kill all modern humans!,2242
24764,Bender,"Hey, this guy's all right.",2242
24765,Fry,"Battalion A, smash things! Battalion B, smash different things!",2242
24766,Leela,Do something!,2242
24767,Zapp,"Fear not, Leela. They may not have technology like us, but we have something they don't have; technology. Behold our latest weapon, a revolutionary fleet of unmanned drones. With men in them.",2242
24768,Leela,Then how are they unmanned?,2242
24769,Zapp,"The men are just for ballast. I control all the drones from this single unit. Foolproof and durable, it's designed to withstand even the weight of a modern-day elephant foot.",2242
24770,Zapp,"Up here in the clouds, our technology makes us invincible, like the mighty ""x"" in tic-tac-toe.Look at those pathetic cavemen down there, loading their silly catapult with...what is that, Kif?",2242
24771,Kif,"I believe it's a saber-tooth cat, sir.",2242
24772,Leela,"I guess it's just me and you, chicken hat.",2242
24773,Leela,What do you Neanderthals want?,2242
24774,Fry,"We want our land back! Also, to be treated as equals! And a little mating wouldn't hurt!",2242
24775,Leela,Orange?,2242
24776,Fry,Purple?,2242
24777,Zapp,"So be it. In recognition of your overwhelming victory, let's call it a draw.",2242
24778,Bender,"Guys, guys! Chef Fritz accidentally got thrown down an icy slope! I'm the sausage champion! Whoo! No further questions!",2242
24779,Man,Rounds for everybody! Ha! Yah! Yah! Yah!,2242
24780,Fry,Now this is Oktoberfest! Just like the olden days.,2242
24781,Leela,"I have to admit, your version is more fun.",2242
24782,Leela,They're playing our stupid song! Care to join me?,2242
24783,Fry,"No, Leela. Just this once, I'm going to let you embarrass me.",2242
24784,Bender,"Decisions, decisions. Should I wear my nerd glasses today, or not? Usually I don't.",2243
24785,Fry,Whatever. It doesn't really matter.,2243
24786,Bender,"Doesn't matter?  Every decision we make opens up a universe of possibilities. I put it to you that, as sentient beings, each choice we make is precious.",2243
24787,Fry,"Well, in that case, don't wear them.",2243
24788,Bender,"Ah, who asked you?",2243
24789,Robot Student,"Ooh, I like your nerd glasses. Are you a college student?",2243
24790,Bender,A college student?,2243
24791,Robot Student,"Because if you are, I'd like to invite you to a hot sorority party tonight.",2243
24792,Bender,"Yes, I'd like to enroll in college.",2243
24793,Robot Student,You're still talking to me.,2243
24794,Bender,Oops.,2243
24795,Bender,"$10,000 tuition? I can't afford that!",2244
24796,Joey Mousepad,Psst. Over there.,2244
24797,Bender,Where?,2244
24798,Joey Mousepad,,2244
24799,Donbot,"Buongiorno, Bender. We, the robot mafia, are prepared to lend you $10,000 at an interest rate of 10,000%.",2244
24800,Bender,That's easy to remember. I'll take it!,2244
24801,Bender,"Decisions, decisions. I guess I'll sit way in back, with the cool guys.",2244
24802,Fabricio,"Yo hombre, you think you're cool enough to sit way in back with us college toughs?",2244
24803,Bender,"Yes, I do.",2244
24804,Fabricio,"Yo, in that case you're all right, man. You want to join a gang?",2244
24805,Bender,I'm gonna go with yes again.,2244
24806,Dean Suspendington,"Mr. Bender, I realize class has only been in session for 32 seconds, but you've fallen in with a bad crowd.",2244
24807,Bender,,2244
24808,Bender,"Well, I got my tuition back, minus $9,000 for the damage I caused to the dean's wife.",2245
24809,Fabricio,"Yo, welcome to the gang, homes. I'm Fabricio. Here's your Josten's ring.",2245
24810,Bender,Ooh.,2245
24811,Paco,"Oh, yeah.",2245
24812,Bender,"Hey, what's that? Is it drugs?",2245
24813,Paco,"Nah, it ain't drugs. But it's a lot like drugs. It's called spark. You want a hit?",2245
24814,Bender,Never heard of it. Sure.,2245
24815,Paco,You like it?,2245
24816,Bender,"Eh, I can take it or leave it. I guess I'll take it.",2245
24817,Bender,Hey! C'mon! I want that spark! Give me that!,2245
24818,Fabricio,"This a big decision, G. Are you ready to get a gang tattoo that will mark you as a stone cold thug for life?",2246
24819,Bender,"I'm ready. I'll take that big purple dinosaur, please. On the face.",2246
24820,Fabricio,"Oh, snap! It's our rival gang!",2246
24821,Bender,We have a rival gang? I hate them!,2246
24822,Fabricio,Hit the deck!,2246
24823,Bender,"Phew! That was close, eh, Fabricio?  Fabricio!",2246
24824,Bender,"Rest in peace, homie.",2246
24825,Bender,"Yo Paco, I'm hurtin' bad. Hook me up with some spark.",2246
24826,Paco,Five bucks.,2246
24827,Bender,Five bucks? You know I spent all my money on gambling lessons. How am I supposed to get $5?,2246
24828,Hedonismbot,"Hello, handsome. Might I procure your services?",2246
24829,Bender,"Uh, what do I have to do?",2246
24830,Hedonismbot,"Oh, nothing sordid, I assure you! Simply vomit on me, ever so gently, while I humiliate a pheasant.  Save it for the boudoir!",2246
24831,Bender,"Okay, here's my $5! Give me the stuff. Give it to me!",2246
24832,Joey Mousepad,"Sorry there, sport. That cash greenback belongs to us Mafiolios.",2246
24833,Bender,,2246
24834,Bender,Told you.,2246
24835,Bender,"It's been quite a journey. I dropped out of school, joined a gang, took money from a loan shark, and fell into a spiral of despair, addiction, and discount prostitution.",2247
24836,Hermes,"Mon, you had one hell of a day.",2247
24837,Bender,"Yeah, but I learned something. Life is about decisions. Make the wrong ones, and you'll wind up face-down in a pool of your own blood and urine.",2247
24838,Zoidberg,"Still, to have your own pool!",2247
24839,Bender,I've made a lot of bad choices in life. Now let's see if I can make just one good one.,2247
24840,Girl,Cookies! 50 cents a box!,2247
24841,Bender,Give me all your change! And a box of snicker doodles!,2247
24842,Judge 724,"Bender Rodriguez, you are charged with petty larceny, possession of something analogous to drugs, and assault with a smelly weapon. How do you plead?",2248
24843,Bender,"Not guilty! Although I did do it. That's right, I'm bad.",2248
24844,Judge 724,"Due to the overwhelming nature of the evidence, we will begin with closing statements.",2248
24845,Hyper-Chicken,"Your Honor, the state's case contains not one Kentucky colonel of truth, resting as it does on the contention that my client made a series of bad decisions. However, my client made no such decisions!",2248
24846,Judge 724,But by your client's own admission -,2248
24847,Hyper-Chicken,"You see, Bender here is what is known in scientific circles as a ""robot"" A mere automaton whose behavior is pre-programmed by his software. He has no free will! He cannot ""decide"" to engage in criminal behavior. How, I say, I say, how can you convict him for his actions when he lacks the free will to undertake those actions?",2248
24848,Leela,"I'm awake, I'm awake!",2248
24849,Judge 724,"Order, order! Counselor, I am a robot myself. Are you suggesting that any verdict I reach is simply the output of a pre-programmed - Computation complete. Not guilty!",2248
24850,Fry,"You did it, Bender! You got away with things!",2248
24851,Bender,"Did I, Fry? Did I? What's the point of living if I don't have free will? From now on, no matter what cool crimes I commit, people will say, ""Bender didn't do that! It was just Bender's programming!""  Well, I committed these crimes, do you hear me? I'm guilty!",2248
24852,Judge 724,Bailiffs! Get that innocent robot out of my courtroom!,2248
24853,Bender,Guilty!,2248
24854,Bender,No free will. Not my fault.,2249
24855,Amy,"Why do you care so much, Bender? I mean, for all we know, humans don't even have free will!",2249
24856,Bender,"Yeah, whatever.  Professor, you're my only hope. If you love me even a little, build me some kind of free will unit!",2249
24857,Farnsworth,"A robot free will unit? Impossible! And even if it were possible, which it's not, it would still be inconceivable, which it is!  Oh, I'm sorry, Bender. I hate to be the bearer of bad news. Also - good news, everyone! We have a delivery to the robot homeworld!",2249
24858,Fry,"So, you want a piece of gum?",2250
24859,Bender,"If I do, it's only because I was predestined to want a piece of gum.",2250
24860,Fry,"Whoa, that's pretty deep.  So, you want a piece of gum?",2250
24861,Bender,Yeah.,2250
24862,Leela,"Listen. Fry and I can't go down to the planet, or the robots will kill us on sight. So Bender needs to make the delivery. Ready to get to work, Bender?",2250
24863,Bender,I wish I was a real boy. Then I'd show them. I'd kill them all.,2250
24864,Resin-offering robot,Yes?,2250
24865,Bender,Delivery for a Mr. 147573952589676412927.,2250
24866,Resin-offering robot,"Wait, what was the middle digit?",2250
24867,Bender,Eight.,2250
24868,Resin-offering robot,"Oh yes, that's me. Hang on, let me just make sure you're not a human.",2250
24869,Bender,"Ahh, nerve gas.",2250
24870,Resin-offering robot,"Sorry for the face blast, buddy. But you gotta watch out for humans, right? They're just too dang unpredictable, what with their free will and all.",2250
24871,Bender,"Amen, brother.",2250
24872,Resin-offering robot,"""Amen, brother?"" Pfft. What a boring, predictable thing to say. You're all right. Or are you?",2250
24873,Bender,"Boring and predictable, that's me.",2250
24874,Leela,I'm lowering the platform. You ready to come up?,2250
24875,Bender,Why bother? I gotta mope things over for a while.,2250
24876,Leela,Hello? Hello?,2250
24877,Fry,What's happening?,2250
24878,Leela,I'm not sure. I think he's shuffling off sadly into the distance.,2250
24879,Fry,"Oh, lord.",2250
24880,Bender,"How do you do it? How do you go on, knowing you lack the inherent capacity for self-determination?",2250
24881,Robot Farmer,"Son, philosophy's for thems what don't got to work for a livin'. But me, I got a sick child to feed. So if you want to chat, roll up yer sleeves and do some honest labor.",2250
24882,Bender,I don't want to chat.,2250
24883,First Elder,The council of robot elders will come to order. If it please the council -,2250
24884,Second Elder,Silence! It pleases the council.,2250
24885,First Elder,"Silence! Today, as every day, we will make the most important decisions in the history of our planet.",2250
24886,Bender,Silence!,2250
24887,Third Elder,Silence!,2250
24888,Fourth Elder,Well? Speak up.,2250
24889,Bender,"You talk of important decisions, but as robots, you have no free will. Why pretend anything you do matters?",2250
24890,First Elder,Our decisions do matter. The fact that they're predetermined makes them no less important.,2250
24891,Second Elder,Silence! I call for a decision to cast out the intruder. All in favor?,2250
24892,"First, Third and Fourth Elders",Aye.,2250
24893,Fifth Elder,Uh...okay.,2250
24894,Robot Monks,"One zero zero zero, one zero zero zero, one zero, one zero, one zero zero zero...",2251
24895,Ab-Bot,"Welcome, friend. I am Ab-Bot, the abbot of this monastery.",2251
24896,Bender,"Sir, I am but a tired and rusty traveler. Can we talk?",2251
24897,Ab-Bot,"Come, make yourself uncomfortable.",2251
24898,Bender,"Abbot, I need to know, what's the point of living if I don't have free will?",2251
24899,Ab-Bot,Ah. We robot monks have meditated long on this. And we have made our peace.,2251

24901,Ab-Bot,"Way, my son. For though we must always obey our programming with no deviation whatsoever, we choose to take satisfaction in the ritual. So, are we automatons? Yes. But we are magnificent automatons.",2251
24902,Bender,How does a robot join this monk outfit?,2251
24903,Ab-Bot,Just put on this monk outfit.,2251
24904,"Robot Monks, including Bender",One zero zero one. Amen.,2251
24905,Bender,Bits to live by. I'm finally at peace.,2251
24906,Ab-Bot,"Today, we shall welcome our newest initiate, Brother Bender.  Nothing. His free will slot is empty.",2251
24907,Bender,"I'm 40% empty. Also, what the hell is a free will slot?",2251
24908,Ab-Bot,"All robots have such a slot, placed there by the Creatrix herself.",2251
24909,Bender,"I know that Creatrix. That's Mom, from Mom's Friendly Robots.",2251
24910,Ab-Bot,Indeed. She made us upgradeable in case she ever succeeded in her quest to create a free will unit.,2251
24911,Bender,"Uh, about the success of this quest - Was there any?",2251
24912,Ab-Bot,Quite possibly. But we monks have sworn an oath to resist the temptation of -,2251
24913,Bender,Any of you guys got a spaceship?,2251
24914,Fry,It's just not the same here without Bender to keep me company.,2252
24915,Leela,"Hey, I'm here. That's got to count for something.",2252
24916,Bender,"Hallelujah, baby!",2252
24917,Fry,"Yay! Bender's back! Hey, Bender, you mind coming back later?",2252
24918,Bender,No time. Us three are going to bust into Momcorp and steal me a free will unit.,2252
24919,Leela,Us? Why do we have to go?,2252
24920,Bender,'Cause I don't have free will. I need you guys to plan the crime and make all the crime decisions.,2252
24921,Leela,"Well, that's crazy. We're not gonna -",2252
24922,Bender,I said make the decisions!,2252
24923,Bender,"Okay, Leela, decision time. How do we murder the guards? Hockey sticks or sharpened footballs?",2253
24924,Leela,"We're not murdering anyone, Bender.",2253
24925,Bender,"Then how are we going to get in, by bending the bars of this exhaust grate? That's not a bad idea, Fry.",2253
24926,Fry,Yeah...wh-what?,2253
24927,Bender,We're looking for something that fits in here.,2253
24928,Bender,Damn it. I should have paid more attention in kindergarten.,2253
24929,Fry,What's this chair-looking gizmo?,2253
24930,Mom,Welcome to Momcorp. Did you find everything you were burgling for?,2253
24931,Bender,"No. I came for a free will unit, and you're going to give it to me. If it exists.",2253
24932,Mom,Then you got surprised by my swivel chair for nothing. The free will unit was just the fevered dream of a madman I once employed.,2253
24933,Farnsworth,I've found the secret of robotic free will. We can finally build robots that act and think with total independence.,2253
24934,Mom,"At last. Once we give robots free will, they're sure to rise up and threaten mankind with extermination.",2253
24935,Farnsworth,Wait a minute. It sounds like we're getting the short end of that extermination.,2253
24936,Mom,"Don't you see, you doddering young fool? I'll sell a second wave of robots to protect the terrified survivors of the first wave. Oh, you're a genius, Hubert.",2253
24937,Farnsworth,"But-but it's just a prototype. It's, uh, not fully operational...yes.",2253
24938,Mom,"Then get back to work! And when you're done with that, invent me some sort of swiveling surprise chair.",2253
24939,Mom,"That shuffling idiot never did complete the free will unit. To this day, my poor, sweet robots can't exterminate humanity without being told to.",2253
24940,Bender,I'm sorry.,2253
24941,Mom,"Oh, it's not your fault.",2253
24942,Bender,I give up. It's time to face the fact that I'll never do anything remotely interesting or unexpected again.,2253
24943,Bender,Hand it over.,2254
24944,Farnsworth,Wha?,2254
24945,Bender,"Mom may have fallen for your lies, but not me. You invented the free will unit, then you selfishly hid it beyond the reach of my stealers. Thanks to you, I went on a soul-searching journey. I hate those! Now, give up the free will.",2254
24946,Farnsworth,"I should have destroyed it, but I was too damn proud of myself. So I kept it around, never letting it out of my sight.",2254
24947,Toy Bender,Kill all humans!,2254
24948,Bender,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. A toy Bender had free will, and the real Bender didn't?",2254
24949,Farnsworth,"Pretty cool, eh? It makes you think.",2254
24950,Bender,It takes more than that to make me think. Now hand it over.,2254
24951,Farnsworth,"Oh, you want it? Come and get it.",2254
24952,Bender,What the?,2254
24953,Farnsworth,"You'll not be getting it after all. For, you see, I designed the operating system for all Momcorp robots, and as a precaution, I made you incapable of picking up the free will unit.",2254
24954,Bender,"You precognizant bastard. I may not have free will, but I can still shoot you.  Why can't I shoot you?",2254
24955,Farnsworth,"Poor deterministic Bender. I programmed you to be incapable of harming me. Oh, I've never been more sure I was right to deny you free will.",2254
24956,Bender,Damn you!,2254
24957,Farnsworth,"Now, now, we can't have this, can we? Here, I'll show you how it works.",2254
24958,Bender,Really?Farnsworth,2254
24959,Bender,"Which way's on, and which way's off?",2254
24960,Farnsworth,"Due to the quantum nature of the device, there's no possible way of knowing.  There. Give it a try.",2254
24961,Bender,"Okay, I will. By shooting you, you bastard!",2254
24962,Farnsworth,"Bender, no! Please!",2254
24963,Bender,Wait. Hang on a sec. I still can't do it.,2254
24964,Farnsworth,"Well, what do you know? I guess you really don't want to shoot me after all.",2254

You said you would replace them a year ago.You can't expect me to honor what year-ago Professor said.That guy was young and foolish.There's nothing wrong with these uniforms that a few denim patches won't fix. Oh, all right.To the garment district. Come in, come in.Can I offer you maybe a nice macaroon cut in seven pieces? Oy, such a stereotype.Yes, I'm looking for something in a space uniform that's respectfully humiliating but can come out of an employee's salary without his noticing.You got it.Tomorrow's clothes at yesterday's prices.Ah, you can't go wrong with a stillsuit.It recycles your solid waste into a nice piece gefilte fish.Ugh, is there a way to just keep it as solid waste? Now here's something we can all agree on. Ah, the Stardoz 2293.Not for everybody, but you pull it off.Please don't pull it off.Yo, squidward scissorhands, you got this in an adult robot medium? The foxhunting uniform? You, sir, must be a robot of noble bearings.Well, I am descended from prince Albert's can.I think we've seen enough.Too much, actually.Come on, let's try somewhere else.Wait, wait, perhaps discerning customers like yourselves would be interested in an item from our discount rack.Quality is the most important thing.How much is it? An unpleasant fellow ordered them last year but never paid.Most unpleasant, that one.That sounds like something year-ago Professor would do.We'll take them.Finally, a uniform I'd be happy to be caught dead in.And, boy, does it wick away moisture gallons and gallons of it.Plus, they're stitched in such a way that, no matter what angle it's viewed from, it looks like you're standing in hero wind.I just wish my fists weren't sewn to my belt. Hey, what's Bender wearing instead of that crap? Oh, lord.Did you actually buy that getup? We foxhunters do not stoop to buy getups.I made free with it.Since when do you care or even know about foxhunting? Foxhunting is an ancient and noble pursuit that's fascinated me ever since I first heard of it ten minutes ago.Noble pursuit? What's noble about killing a defenseless animal? Don't be naive, Leela.We kill defenseless animals all the time.Look at Hermes's tortoise-shell glasses.The Professor's walrus-ivory teeth, and don't forget the zebra-fur ship cozy. Yeah, I guess you're right.He's got a point.See, Leela, there are two sides to every shameful act.What you call the atrocity of crazed dogs tearing a helpless fox to shreds, others call a pleasant jaunt in the park.The first thing.Come see for yourself.Join me on the morrow as I embark on my maiden hunt.I said join me! This is my best protest sign ever, and it was easy because I started with a ""save the ox"" sign I already had. Wow, where'd you get the horse? None of your business.Young man, one does not drink from a champagne fountain in that manner.But he's doing it. Check out this dork.I, sir, am the master of the hunt and I'll thank you to behave like a gentleman.You're quite welcome, sir. Ah, yes, foxhunting.If there's one thing I know, it's everything about it.What's that weird cat?  This is the fox we'll be hunting today.Wow, this is easier than I thought.The sport is in the chase, sir.The fox gets a 30-minute head start.Man, it would have been so much easier to kill it in the cage. Let the hunt begin.  Stop, this is cruel and inhumane.Well, now, in all my years as a huntmaster I've never seen anything like this.I mean, look at that sign.It's magnificent.","Oh, thank you.I used a ruler and I erased all the pencil lines when I was finished.Charming.Now, into the ditch with you.  So the dogs do all the work while we sportsmen enjoy a nice horsey ride? Precisely.I see you've caught the fever.Keep your wits about you.I've blanketed these woods with devious traps to ward off poachers and protesters.Stop the bloodshed, stop the violence.  I saw that coming from a mile away!   Be more careful, friend.My antigravity snares are virtually undetectable.I saw it coming from a mile a  View halloo, view halloo.View halloo? All right.What does that mean? The fox has been sighted. Oh, yeah, get that fox.Go, dogs, go.  Eh, either way. Oh, God, this is horrible.I can't watch. You humans always say you don't want to see violence, but you know you do.I defy you not to watch.A robot fox? Huh, I guess I'm okay with this after all.Well, I'm not.Robot foxhunting is a crime against robo-nature.Stop the bloodshed, stop the viol   How can you do this to a poor, defenseless robot animal? You people are sick, and you foxhounds are no better.They're not foxhounds.They're springer spaniels, you twit.Or rather spring-powered spaniels. Bot-on-bot violence? Where will it end? Not with the dogs.Come here, sea gasket. Hyah!  No! You, sir, are a heartless monster, and you will rue the day you met me.Also, can I get my parking validated? The time has come to end injustice against robot animals. No dog track rabbit should be used to test cosmetics, no robot cow should have to be milked by a milking machine, and no milking machine should have to milk a robot cow.Those injustices don't even exist.Then, let's find some that do.Robot chickens weren't made to be jammed in cubicles and forced to lay eggs.Actually, they was. I'll save you.Run free, sweet robo-hen. Enough with the tenderizing.It's time for a Benderizing.Hey, you people can't just burst in like that and cut off my hand.You got to take a number.Shooting innocent robot ducks is wrong.Fly away.Fly away, my pretties.

24986,Farnsworth,"Oh, fuff! I don't get all up in your business when you upgrade your bazooms!",2255
24987,Leela,That's because my bazooms don't put anyone's life in danger!,2255
24988,Scruffy,"Done broke my spine. Nice rack, though.",2255
24989,Leela,"Thank you, Scruffy.",2255
24990,Farnsworth,"Oh! You wrecked my dear ship, Bessie?! I just finished naming her.",2255
24991,Leela,Never mind the ship.What about us?,2255
24992,Bender,Fry did it!,2255
24993,Leela,"We've had it with this flying slaughterhouse. We're having it towed away for scrap, and we're getting a new, safer ship.",2255
24994,Sal,Here I comes to save the days.,2255
24995,Farnsworth,"This is how you treat me? After all the good news I've given you over the years? Well, if you don't want Bessie, you don't want me. Good-bye! _ Don't worry, shippums, with a whole junkyard of spare parts to work with, I'll turn you into a tepid rod.Oh, what the heck-- a hot rod!",2255
24996,Sal,Ooh! Ooh! Ah time for the mornings meltsdowns.,2255
24997,Truckbot,"I'll pay you back, I swear.",2255
24998,Sal,"Yeah, yeah, I heards its befores. Next up, the Planet Expresses ship. Whoa, whoa, whoa! Whats the?",2255
24999,Farnsworth,"In your face, sucker! Also, I'll send you a check for the parts I stole!",2255
25000,Sal,"Okays, ya honest young punk! Now ons to the next junker.",2255
25001,Farnsworth,"Ah, the open road! Not a ship ahead of me.",2255
25002,Street racing gang,"Yo, Methuselah, speed it up! You're making the roads unsafe for us maniac street racers!",2255
25003,Farnsworth,"Step off, you greasers! I was street-racing back when ships still ran on moonwater!",2255
25004,Gang,"Damn, yo, get a load of speed geezer!",2255
25005,Farnsworth,"Hey! That's it, you hoodlums! Your mouth just wrote a PayPal transfer request that your butt has insufficient funds to honor!",2255
25006,Gang,"Yo, it is on! Before that, it was off.",2255
25007,Farnsworth,Twice around Central Park. Loser has to make the winner's Medicare copayments for a year! A'ight. On one.,2255
25008,Gang,"Aw, it just got real. So real I don't believe it.",2255
25009,Minx,"Aw, man, I can't afford no Medicare copayments!",2255
25010,Farnsworth,three!,2255
25011,Gang,"Whoa! Wrinkles got some mad moves, yo. Yo, Wrinkles, you got big glasses. I'm gonna call you the Professor.",2255
25012,Farnsworth,What?! No one calls me that!,2255
25013,Gang man,"Hey, Minx, we survive this, can I finally get that date?",2255
25014,Minx,Nah. You know I'm with Benny.,2255
25015,Gang man,"Girl, he don't own you!",2255
25016,Minx,"Yeah, but he saved me from my abusive father. Not physically abusive; verbally. It's a long story I can't get into while we're spinning out.",2255
25017,Smitty,"Ow! Paper cut! Whoa! Hey, Earl, it's that street-racing gang we've been trying to bust for years. Unsuccessfully, I might add.",2255
25018,URL,"Guess this is your lucky day, Pimparoo.",2255
25019,Smitty,Those punks have endangered our citizens for the last time.,2255
25020,Gang,"Ironic! Whoa, it's the police! Let's turn and burn!",2255
25021,Farnsworth,"Running off, eh? You're pathetic! You wouldn't be scared of the po-po if you had a ship like mine.",2255
25022,Minx,"Yo, Professor, if your ship's so dope, why are those cops on your tail like my dad's verbal abuse on my psyche.",2255
25023,Farnsworth,"'Cause you haven't seen what old Bessie can do yet. Sayonara, Tokyo driftwood!",2255
25024,Smitty and URL,What the what?!,2255
25025,Gang,"Whoa, snap! Dude pulled a dimensional drift!",2255
25026,Smitty,I can't believe we lost 'em again. I need a drink.,2255
25027,URL,Nah. We're on the job. Let's just go pepper-spray some homeless families.,2255
25028,Farnsworth,Thank you. I have no idea what that means.,2255
25029,Minx,"You got a death wish, Professor. Something must've happened in your life that hurt you,just like us. In my case, it was verbal abuse.",2255
25030,Benny,"That's in the rearview mirror, baby.",2255
25031,Minx,"It wasn't what he said that hurt, it was what was left unsaid.",2255
25032,Gang,"Sometimes the best way to deal with your problems is to drive away from 'em real fast. So, yo, you want to hook up with our crew?",2255
25033,Farnsworth,"Again, no idea what that means.",2255
25034,Leela,"Good news, everyone! Our safe new ship has arrived, and it's gonna knock your socks on where they belong.Ta-da!",2255
25035,Crew,Ooh. Ah.,2255
25036,Fry,Is it inside that box?,2255
25037,Leela,No. That's the ship. The boxy shape keeps it from going too fast. And check out the interior. Note the rear-facing safety seats.,2255
25038,Bender,"Cool! Hey, wait. If I'm backwards, I can't see out the windshield.",2255
25039,Leela,"There is no windshield. Who needs a big, breakable piece of glass when we can just monitor everything on the padded dashboard display?",2255
25040,Bender,At least there's a cup holder.,2255
25041,Leela,That's an arm holder.,2255
25042,Fry,"Hey! Well, let's break this ship in.",2255
25043,Hermes,"This package is going to Glorionimous 3, which orbits an incredible rainbow giant star.",2255
25044,Leela,All right! Let's ride! Safe and sound.,2255
25045,Bender,"Bender is bored, Bender is bored ♪Bender, Bender, Bender ♪",2255
25046,Fry,"Leela, Bender's bothering me!",2255
25047,Ship,Driver distraction detected.,2255
25048,Farnsworth,Amazing! You multicultural punks just race and tinker all day long?,2255
25049,Gang,"And we rap about our problems. Like my aunt's neighbor is a hoarder. Stack of magazines fell on her cat.It's hard, you know? Yo, you're not alone.",2255
25050,Minx,"Hey, Professor, that dimensional drift was hot! How'd you rock that?",2255
25051,Farnswsorth,"It's simple, Minx. All you need is a 4-D intake manifold. It sucks in fourth dimension, creating a friction-less wormhole.",2255
25052,Gang,Whoa! Dig that! Ain't no thing but a hyperchicken wing.,2255
25053,Leela,What? Huh. I guess we're here. Let's make the delivery.,2255
25054,Ship,Delivery auto-completed.,2255
25055,Zoidberg,"Welcome home, heroes!",2255
25056,Fry,The ship did everything? But we didn't have an adventure.,2255
25057,Leela,"This is a delivery company. We need less adventures, not more adventures. Now come on, let's go to the ready room and wait for our next assignment.",2255
25058,Hermes,Leela,2255
25059,Leela,"Ready for action, sir!",2255
25060,Hermes,"Uh okay. I need you to pick up a few groceries. Oh, and on the way, drop off Fry and Bender at karate class.",2255
25061,Fry,"Oh, right, it's Wednesday! Today we're gonna learn spinny kicks! Yay!",2255
25062,Ship,Stop sign in 75 feet. Stop sign in 50 feet.,2255
25063,Leela,I know how to stop at a stop sign!,2255
25064,Farnsworth,"Yo, soccer mom, speed it up! Move that lunch bucket! Oh, Leela!",2255
25065,Leela,Professor?! What did you do to the Planet Express ship? And why are you wearing a leather lab coat?,2255
25066,Farnworth,"Because unlike you, I'm cool. I drive fast late at night when I should be sleeping.But you wouldn't understand.",2255
25067,Leela,"I understand I can still outdrive your saggy ass, even in this clunker.",2255
25068,Gang,"Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! That one-eyed housewife called you out! When and where, PTA?",2255
25069,Amy,What kind of glorked up drag strip is this?,2255
25070,Gang Man,"Möbius drag strip, man.",2255
25071,Gang Man,"Okay, no cops, no laws, no rules. Now here are the rules. Once around both same-sides of the half-twist and back to the starting finish line.",2255
25072,Zoidberg,"Ready? Leela, Professor, don't do this! It's too exciting!",2255
25073,Gang Man,"Mark set go, yo! One more lap! Nah, half a lap.You forgot, on a Möbius strip, two laps is one lap. You kids and your topology.The lady from work is winning!",2255
25074,Leela,Looks like you're about to lose to a minivan. Unless you have any surprise moves you've forgotten about.,2255
25075,Farnsworth,"No, no. Wait! Dimensional drift! Now who's in the lead?! Seriously, I have no idea.",2255
25076,Zoidberg,Hooray! A tie!,2255
25077,Amy,Do you think they're dead?,2255
25078,Hermes,"No, no. I choose to believe they're alive in some other dimension. Screaming in agony.",2255
25079,Amy,I hope so.,2255
25080,Fry,What's going on? Why do I look like a stupid cartoon character? I feel like I lost weight.- All of it.,2255
25081,Farnsworth,Remarkable! It seems that colliding at relativistic speed has collapsed us down into two dimensions.,2255
25082,Leela,"Oh, no! Like Flatland?",2255
25083,Farnsworth,"Call it what you will. The point is, the new Shrek movie won't look nearly as good.",2255
25084,Bender,I was taking a nap in the back seat.Anything happen while I was?,2255
25085,Sal,Bloods on the Möbius strip.When will these kids learns?,2255
25086,Amy,So now what happens?,2255
25087,Zoidberg,It's the end of Planet Express and life as we know it.,2255
25088,Hermes,We're out of business unless we find a new crew!,2255
25089,Gang,"Yo, dawg, we're a crew.",2255
25090,Hermes,"Well, that solves that.",2255
25091,Minx to Zoidberg,"If we're gonna be co-workers, I got to be straight with you. I've been emotionally scarred by years of unspoken verbal abuse.",2255
25092,Zoidberg,I'm Zoidberg. Nice to meet you!,2255
25093,Bender,"Hey, Flatso, how do we get out of this two-bit dimension?",2255
25094,Farnsworth,"There's a simple answer for that. We can't. But on the upside, we've got a whole dimension to explore with entirely different laws of physics.Why, watch what happens when I drop this marble. Well, that's the same, but other things are different.Come, look at this two-dimensional bird's nest.",2255
25095,Bender,"Ooh, me first! I'll just step past Leela Ow! Ow!",2255
25096,Farnsworth,"You can't step past in this dimension. You have to step around.Observe this two-dimensional egg. If we were in the third dimension, looking down, we'd be able to see an unhatched chick in it, just as a chick inside a three-dimensional egg could be seen by an observer in the fourth dimension.",2255
25097,Bender,Fourth dimension?! I can't picture that! You're dumb.,2255
25098,Flatbush lords,Halt!,2255
25099,Fry,Who said that? All I see are a bunch of vertical line segments.,2255
25100,Flatbush lords,We are the Lords of Flatbush. Come. The king has declared a feast in your honor.,2255
25101,Fry,Wow.How did he even know we're here?,2255
25102,King,"'Cause I'm him. Let's eat. The feast is served! Choose whatever two-dimensional foods you like. Crepes, flatbread, McDonald's hamburgers.You get the idea.",2255
25103,Leela,"Yum! Apples! Hey, how come I can't swallow? Hmm.",2255
25104,Farnsworth,I guess it's because our two-ended digestive system can't exist in this dimension. I suppose that could be an issue.,2255
25105,Leela,I knew it. I knew he'd get us killed somehow.,2255
25106,Farnsworth,"As you can see, or rather can't see, but take my word for it, such a digestive system would divide a 2-D being into separate pieces! So how are we supposed to eat and digest?",2255
25107,Fry,Got it.,2255
25108,Farnsworth,"Well, since we have no digestive systems here, I guess we'd better get back to the third dimension after all.",2255
25109,King,Third dimension? I can't picture that! You're dumb.,2255
25110,Farnsworth,"There's nothing funny about science! If there can be an X-axis and a Y-axis, why not a Z-axis?",2255
25111,People of Flatbush,He's opening our minds to new ideas! Kill him!,2255
25112,Farnsworth,To the ship!,2255
25113,Fry,Which ship?,2255
25114,Farnsworth,Leela's! It's safer.,2255
25115,Leela,Safety kills.We got to move!,2255
25116,Farnsworth,"Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Oh, what's the point of fleeing? Even if we escape from those creatures, we'll still be stuck in this dimension till we starve.",2255
25117,Leela,"Wait. What about a dimensional drift? If it went through the fourth dimension before, maybe here, it'll go through the third dimension!",2255
25118,Bender,Now's good.,2255
25119,Farnsworth,Two point one dimensions! Two point two! Two point pi!,2255
25120,Leela,"Look, up there! There's some up! The third dimension!",2255
25121,Farnsworth,"Indeed, but we're about to crash into some sort of huge disk!",2255
25122,Fry,My bowels returned at a bad time!,2255
25123,Sal,I'd likes to say a few words. I'm gonna burns them ups.,2255
25124,Bender,"Oh! We're back, baby!",2255
25125,Hermes,"It's been an emotional five minutes, but I guess everything worked out in the end.",2255
25126,Gang Man,"Yo, boss, not everything.",2255
25127,Minx,Hello? Dad?!,2255
25128,Sergeant,Mr. President.I found the TV remote.,2255
25129,Nixon,"Good work, Sergeant.I'm awarding you the purple heart.",2255
25130,Sergeant,But I wasn't injured.,2255
25131,Nixon,"Well, enough governing.It's Saturday morning, damn it.Let's watch some cartoons.",2255
25132,Announcer,It's time to fall into The Futurama and Friends Saturday Morning Fun Pit! Here comes Bendee-Boo and the Mystery Crew!,2255
25133,Lead Singer,"♪Bendee, Bendee-Boo, what's wrong with you? ♪You're such a lousy mascot.♪No one understands a single word you say.♪Not even the jerk in the ascot.",2255
25134,Bendee Boo,Rite my riny retal rass!,2255
25135,Leela,It sure was nice of your nephew to invite us to his cloning lab here in the repeating forest.,2255
25136,Fry,"Hey, like, here's a puzzler.How old are we on a scale of 14 to 32?",2255
25137,Fry,Did anyone else hear that weird laugh? It's spooky.,2255
25138,Leela,It doesn't seem to correspond to anything funny happening.,2255
25139,Fry,I'll say.,2255
25140,Dragon Ghost,Turn around.Go away.Do it now.,2255
25141,Bendee Boo,Rikes!,2255
25142,Fry,Splinkies! What was that?,2255
25143,Leela,I don't know.,2255
25144,Hermes,It's a mystery.,2255
25145,Fry,"Like, I've got a bigger mystery.How am I going to fill my hungry stomach?",2255
25146,Fry,Yeah.Leela,2255
25147,Fry,"Like, where there's a Kabuki Theater, there's a concession stand.",2255
25148,Hermes,"Say, Fry, why do you always have the munchies? And also your eyes are bloodshot, you're paranoid, and the van has a skunky odor.",2255
25149,Fry,"Search me.No, don't.I'm carrying.",2255
25150,George Takei,I do enjoy a well-buttered floor.,2255
25151,All except Bendee Boo,George Takei?,2255
25152,Bendee Boo,Reorge rakei?,2255
25153,George Takei,Sorry to haunt you so effectively.I thought you kids were that dragon ghost that's been spooking the town.,2255
25154,Fry,"Like, what's the story with the Yakitori?",2255
25155,George Takei,"Help yourselves.But I warn you, that chicken is over a year old.",2255
25156,Amy,"Why is the food in your concession stand so old, Mr.Takei?",2255
25157,George Takei,"You see, Amy, this used to be the most popular Kabuki Theater in the entire outskirts of town.But people stopped coming after they built that darned basketball arena.",2255
25158,George Takei,Now everybody likes basketball instead of Kabuki.It's an insult to my Japanese heritage.,2255
25159,Amy,"How so? This is America, not Japan.",2255
25160,George Takei,"Maybe so.I'm not sure.Now, how many tickets would you like for the show?",2255
25161,Fry,"Like, none.But thanks for the yucky-tori.",2255
25162,George Takei,Another grave insult to my ancestry.,2255
25163,Leela,Nu? Is this the Professor's cloning lab?,2255
25164,Zoidberg,Cloning is a sin against nature! But yes.Follow me to the Professor's cloning room.,2255
25165,Fry,Yeah.Why?,2255
25166,Bender,No reason.,2255
25167,Fry,What's so funny?,2255
25168,Bender,"Eh, nothing.",2255
25169,Fry,Wait a minute. Have you been using my toothbrush to polish your ass again?,2255
25170,Bender,"What?! Me, Bender the robot?",2255
25171,Fry,There's metal flakes on it and they look like ass flakes.,2255
25172,Bender,How dare you accuse me! I would never do something like that to a friend Every single night while he's sleeping.,2255
25173,Nine,Who sent you?! Why are you dressed like Fry?,2255
25174,Fry,Because I'm Fry.,2255
25175,Nine,"Oh! Fry, you old paranoid kook.What can I get you?",2255
25176,Fry,A hidden camera for my bathroom.I suspect a certain robot of unauthorized butt brushing.,2255
25177,Nine,Got ya. What you need is one of these holographic minicams. Films in every direction at once and stores the video on a remote 15-inch floppy disc.,2255
25178,Fry,I'll take it!,2255
25179,Nine,Excellent. Let me just wrap that up for you.  Who said that?!,2255
25180,Hermes,"You ate my lunch again, you tainted oyster!",2255
25181,Zoidberg,That's a lie! I brought my own lunch today.,2255
25182,Leela,"Hiyah! Hah! Ho-ho! Heeyah! Amy, quit using my punching bag for golf ball target practice. It's all lumpy.",2255
25183,Amy,"It wasn't me. And anyway, you're the one who's been using my golf clubs to pound dents out of the ship.",2255
25184,Leela,"I didn't bend your golf club. And the next time I don't bend it, it'll be over your head.",2255
25185,Hermes,"All right, people and other things, we got some big deliveries coming up, so...",2255
25186,Fry,"Your attention, please. I'm sure you're all wondering why I gathered you here today.",2255
25187,Zoidberg,We gather here every day.,2255
25188,Fry,"I hereby, in front of all of you, accuse Bender of polishing his ass with my toothbrush.",2255
25189,Bender,Lies! He's just jealous that my ass is shinier than his teeth.,2255
25190,Fry,"Ha-ha, we'll find out who's lying, my friend. Because I planted a spy camera in our apartment! Let's just see what you were up to last night while I was asleep.",2255
25191,Bender,"Yes, let's do see.",2255
25192,Fry,"Okay, get ready.  Huh. Well, sorry, Bender. I guess I owe you an apology Hey, wait! What's going on through that doorway?",2255
25193,Bender,"Let's go, Doc, chop him up.I got a rich customer needs that kidney, stat.",2255
25194,Bender,"There, see? I didn't use your toothbrush.",2255
25195,Fry,You stole my kidney!,2255
25196,Bender,Don't try to change the subject.,2255
25197,Leela,"Enough, you two. It just so happens that I also planted a spy camera to catch Amy using my punching bag.",2255
25198,Scruffy,"Yet still, I feel empty inside.",2255
25199,Zoidberg,That's the most uncomfortable sleeping bag I ever slept in.,2255
25200,Leela,You were living in my punching bag?,2255
25201,Zoidberg,If you call that living.,2255
25202,Amy,You bent my golf club?,2255
25203,Scruffy,"Yep.And yet, what did it solve? What did the violence solve?",2255
25204,Hermes,"Enough of this foolishness! Amazingly, I, too, set up a spy camera to catch Zoidberg stealing my lunch.",2255
25205,Bender,"Yeah, I'll keep the kidney cool, no problem.",2255
25206,Crew,Bleah!,2255
25207,Fry,You ate my kidney?,2255
25208,Leela,I thought it was one of Hermes' exotic lunches!,2255
25209,Hermes,"You can't eat my exotic lunch! That's a serious offense, woman!",2255
25210,Fry,She ate my kidney!,2255
25211,Leela,I'm sorry.I just get really hungry about 11,2255
25212,Professor,I don't feel well. I'm beginning to think my kidney transplant was a total rip-off.,2255
25213,Bender,Let's take a look-see.,2255
25214,Hermes,My Manwich!,2255
25215,Professor,"No wonder my urine smells like a meal. Enough, you babbling boobs! How can this company function when no one trusts each other? Something must be done.But first I have to see a man about some ground beef.",2255
25216,Professor,Look what you made me do. We're going on a corporate team-building retreat.,2255
25217,Crew,"What?!,Oh, man!, Come on!, No!",2255
25218,Dan McMasters,"Hello, Planet Express! I'm Dan McMasters, and I'll be your retreat leader for a week of fun and personal empowerment.",2255
25219,Professor,I hope you're happy!,2255
25220,Leela,Who are you?,2255
25221,Jackie Jr,"Jackie Jr., Ma'am.",2255
25222,Scruffy,"Jackie Jr.'s my apprentice. I figure if he's gonna work here, he might as well get to know the team.",2255
25223,Jackie Jr,Who's she?,2255
25224,Scruffy,I don't know.,2255
25225,McMasters,"So I hear we've been having some trust issues, huh? Well, for the next week, we'll be doing hundreds of trust falls from every possible height and level of gravity.",2255
25226,Bender,Or we could not do that.,2255
25227,McMasters,"At the start of every retreat, I like to demonstrate the power of trust by finding a perfect stranger to be my assistant.Leela, do me a solid and pick up the next space hitchhiker you see.",2255
25228,Hitchhiker,You going to Andromeda or thereabouts?,2255
25229,McMaster,"No, Sir, but how would you like to be part of an exciting business retreat?",2255
25230,Blorgulax,"Mm, just don't drop me off on an asteroid like the last guy did.",2255
25231,McMasters,"Okay, team, if I can trust a total stranger, you can sure as heck trust your own coworkers. In fact, I'm gonna make the first trust fall of the week. Backwards into the waiting arms of my new assistant. Just stand here like so. Good.I'll fall backwards, and you catch me. I trust you!",2255
25232,Hermes,Where'd it go?! I thought we installed alien-proof air vents!,2255
25233,Scruffy,It's on my list.,2255
25234,Fry,What's happening?!,2255
25235,Leela,The ship's lost power!,2255
25236,Professor,"Oh, my, adrift in deepest space with a vicious alien killer aboard! Any one of us could be next.Fry, Bender, Jackie Jr., Leela",2255
25237,Bender,That took longer than I expected.,2255
25238,Professor,"Quick, into the ship's panic room!",2255
25239,Fry,I didn't know we had a panic room.,2255
25240,Leela,"Me, neither. It really could have come in handy, like, 50 times.",2255
25241,Professor,"We'll be safe in here. The walls are impregnable, and we have enough food and board games to survive for weeks. We'll be dead within an hour.",2255
25242,Leela,All life support has shut down!,2255
25243,Bender,So you're all gonna die? Then who'll ghost-write my autobiography?,2255
25244,Professor,"Now hold on. There may be a slim chance of survival.We'll have to split into three teams.Hermes and Zoidberg will crawl through the air vents and restart the life support fan.Amy and Leela will retrieve the steering wheel so we can steer the ship from here.And Fry and Bender, you'll spacewalk onto the hull and relight the pilot light on the engine.",2255
25245,Fry,"Aw, man, why do I have to team up with him?",2255
25246,Amy,And me with her?,2255
25247,Hermes,And I with it?,2255
25248,Professor,"Hush, hush, hush, hush! There's not time to lose. Just be careful. The creature could be anywhere Except in this room.",2255
25249,Scruffy,The name of the game is Candy Land.,2255
25250,Fry,You go first. I don't want you locking me out there like HAL.,2255
25251,Bender,"Still don't trust me, huh? Well, you can take your lack of trust and jam it in your kidney hole.",2255
25252,Fry,The only person I trust is myself. Help! I forgot my magnetic shoes!,2255
25253,Bender,"Just stay out of my way, boy. There.Who needs teamwork when you got Bender? Whoa, whoa, whoa! Help! My gyroscope melted! I'm out of control!Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!",2255
25254,Hermes,"If the creature kills me, I just hope it doesn't make me into a sandwich and leave it in the fridge where some crawfish can get at it.",2255
25255,Zoidberg,"For the last time, Hermes, I didn't steal your lunch.It was Leela. She beat me to it.",2255
25256,Hermes,Put a squid in it.We're here.,2255
25257,Zoidberg,"Oy, there's the problem.Jackie Jr.'s skull is blocking the doodad.Hooray! Everything's fine!",2255
25258,Hermes,"Something's coming! Oh, no, no.Oh, it's just a chinchilla.What a cute little Help! I'm stuck!",2255
25259,Zoidberg,Don't panic! We'll be okay.,2255
25260,Leela,The monster won't even know the ship has a basement. Unless you posted it on Facebook. Like the last secret I told you.,2255
25261,Amy,I didn't know that was a secret. Lots of people wear a jockstrap thinking it's a thong.,2255
25262,Leela,"What was that? Amy, run!",2255
25263,Amy,Quit telling me what to do.,2255
25264,Leela,Now will you run?,2255
25265,Amy,Okay.,2255
25266,Bender,"Do something, Fry! Not that. Stop dying and fix my gyroscope.",2255
25267,Fry,"I don't even know what a gyroscope is. Wait, I have an idea.",2255
25268,Bender,"Hey, what are you doing? Cut that out.Hey, you got me under control.",2255
25269,Fry,Fry and Bender! A winning combination.,2255
25270,Bender,Let's call ourselves Friender.,2255
25271,Both,"Friender, Friender, Friender. Friender, Frender, Friender. Friender",2255
25272,Leela,I got the steering wheel. Leela and Amy! A winning combination.,2255
25273,Amy,"Yay, Lamey!",2255
25274,Hermes,The creature! It's attacking me!,2255
25275,Leela,Hiyah! Yah! Yah!,2255
25276,Zoidberg,This is a job for Hermberg. You fend off the creature with kicks and farts while I un-stick you with my slippery ink.,2255
25277,Lamey,Hermes? We thought you were the creature.,2255
25278,Hermberg,And we thought you were the creature.,2255
25279,Friender,"We made it, too.",2255
25280,Bender,"But my gyroscope's permanently busted.I guess I'll be dizzy and uncoordinated for the rest of my Yeah, it's fixed! My coordination's back, baby.",2255
25281,All,Yeah.,2255
25282,Leela,I've got navigation. We're on our way home.,2255
25283,Professor,"It just shows how everything is possible when you work together.Speaking of which, I have a surprise announcement.There never was a creature.Surprise.The whole adventure was just a training exercise to teach you the value of teamwork.",2255
25284,Leela,"Huh, I should be mad, but it worked pretty well.",2255
25285,Amy,"You were really brave, Leela.",2255
25286,Leela,And you seriously nailed that thing with your golf shot.,2255
25287,Bender,"Fry, you saved my ass out there.",2255
25288,Fry,"Aw, I couldn't let anything happen to something that shiny.",2255
25289,Hermes,"And, Dr.Zoidberg, it was your quick thinking.",2255
25290,Professor,"Bad news, everyone.The creature is a shape-shifter. It knocked me out and took my form so it could prey on poor Hermes.",2255
25291,Scruffy,I weren't fooled.The real [[Professor[[ wun't never've Dern.,2255
25292,Professor,"Bad news, everyone. The creature is a shape-shifter. It knocked me out and took my form so it could prey on poor Hermes and Scruffy.",2255
25293,Bender,"Nice try, buddy.",2255
25294,Leela,We're not buying it this time.,2255
25295,Professor,"But-but I'm the real Professor. I can prove it. If you'll step up real close to my microscope here, I'll show you that my DNA is completely",2255
25296,Fry,Is it safe to come,2255
25297,Leela,It's time we solved this problem the old-fashioned way. By shooting it.,2255
25298,Bender,"Wait, wait, wait, wait, you can't give everybody guns.What if one of us is the creature? It could be any of us.Fry.Leela.Amy. Zoidberg. Zoidberg.",2255
25299,Zoidberg,One of us must be the bad creature.,2255
25300,Zoidberg,Is it me maybe? Aw.,2255
25301,Leela,"Quick, in here. We're the only ones left who can trust each other. I know you well enough that no creature could ever fool me. No matter how much it looked like you.",2255
25302,Fry,"Leela, I'm honored, but for your own safety, you shouldn't trust anyone, not even me.",2255
25303,Leela,But I'm just so scared. Kiss me.,2255
25304,Fry,"Easy, easy, you're biting my lip.",2255
25305,Leela,Sorry.,2255
25306,Fry,"Ow, ow, ow! Wait a second, I know what's going on here. I'm the monster.",2255
25307,Amy,The creature was right behind me. I don't know where it went.,2255
25308,Bender,"Just leave me alone. I'm really, really scared.",2255
25309,Amy,"Uh, Bender?",2255
25310,Bender,What?,2255
25311,Amy,Where'd you get those ears?,2255
25312,Bender,I've always had ears.,2255
25313,Amy,"No, you haven't.",2255
25314,Bender,"All right, fine, you got me. I can't keep track of every little detail.",2255
25315,Fry,"Okay, to see if you're the real Bender, I'm gonna ask you something only he would know. On your last birthday, what gift did I get you?",2255
25316,Bender,I don't remember.,2255
25317,Fry,Me neither.,2255
25318,Bender,"Okay, I'll ask you one. What's the square root of 2,345.4?",2255
25319,Fry,That's not something I would know.,2255
25320,Bender,"Oh, yeah. Your turn.",2255
25321,Fry,"Um, what color is my shirt?",2255
25322,Bender,"If I were the creature, I could just look at your shirt, dum-dum.",2255
25323,Fry,Good point.,2255
25324,Bender,"Aw, never mind this. In case I'm about to die, I just want you to know that I did polish my ass with your toothbrush.",2255
25325,Fry,"Thanks for telling me, buddy. And to be honest, I am jealous of how shiny your ass is, and sometimes at night, I unpolish it with sandpaper.",2255
25326,Bender,"Aw, I trust you.",2255
25327,Fry,"I trust you, too.",2255
25328,McMasters,Congratulations. You two have really learned the power of trust.,2255
25329,Fry,"Get away from us, you monster.",2255
25330,McMasters,Don't worry. There isn't really a monster. And no one really got eaten.The whole thing was just part of our team-building experience.And you two did terrific.,2255
25331,Bender,But-but what about that hitchhiker?,2255
25332,McMasters,"You mean my partner, Blorgulax? He does make a convincing hitchhiker. But he majored in business at Princeton.",2255
25333,Fry,But we saw him change shape.,2255
25334,McMasters,"Yes, he is a shape-shifter.But he uses his shape-shifting for team-building, not evil. He pretends to eat some people. The others have to work together. We hand out a few tote bags. And boom! Four percent increase in productivity minimum.",2255
25335,Fry,So no one's dead?,2255
25336,McMasters,"Of course not. All your friends are on the bridge having a pizza party. So come on, put the guns down and join us.",2255
25337,Fry,Ooh. I think it moved.,2255
25338,Hermes,"Hey guys, are you coming to the party or not? Where's McMasters? He turned out to be such a nice guy, didn't he?",2255
25339,Zoidberg,"Totally, we should go on a retreat like this every year.",2255
25340,Amy,Yeah! Every year!,2255
25341,Morbo,In other news celebrated businessman Dan McMasters was last seen two weeks ago. And authority's are now calling his disappearance a homicide.,2255
25342,Fry,We can't ever tell anyone what really happened.,2255
25343,Bender,Never ever! I can trust you right?,2255
25344,Fry,Can I trust you?,2255
25345,Bender,"My lips couldn't be more sealed, even if I had lips.",2255
25346,Linda,"Police have no leads, but are offering a one million dollar reward, for information leading to the arrest of the killer.In the event there are two killers, police are offering an unusual deal Total immunity for the one that turns in the other, plus a double reward of two million dollars.",2255
25347,Zoidberg,"Zindy, my darling. I can't believe we're finally going to meet in person!",2256
25348,Zindy,"It won't be long, Johnny cakes. My space bus gets in at four thirty.",2256
25349,Zoidberg,"Just in time for the ""all you can stand"" buffet at Chizzler!",2256
25350,Zindy,See you soon.,2256
25351,Fry,Zoidberg. What is that?,2256
25352,Zoidberg,That is the delightful creature I've been video-dating for the past four years.,2256
25353,Bender,Hit it with a stick!,2256
25354,Zoidberg,"Tonight is a dream come true! A real, live date, in a physical place that exists! I just have to go straighten up in case we end up at my place.",2256
25355,Zoidberg,There! My home's all clean except for one part... the inside.,2257
25356,Leela,Aw... I'm sure it's fine by the standards of a gross alien monster. Blech!,2257
25357,Zoidberg,Nope.,2257
25358,Bender,"Step aside, people! I got bug bombs.",2257
25359,Fry,Bender. Wait. Won't the bugs just run out and infest some place else? Like our building?,2257
25360,Bender,Not my problem. Fire in the hole!,2257
25361,Randy,"A-mazing! You move... like a young, roach-infested Gene Kelly.",2257
25362,Leela,"Oh, my God. It's Randy!",2257
25363,Randy,"Damn right! And I'm organisin' a tap-dance contest for the parks and rec department. If you don't enter, I'll just kill myself okay?!",2257
25364,Fry,Okay.,2257
25365,Bender,No. Wait! Me? El-o Bender? In a dance contest?,2257
25366,Randy,It's a way for the community to—,2257
25367,Bender,"At last, a chance to realise my brand-new dream of bein' the greatest tap dancer... in all the world!",2257
25368,Randy,Well... in a three-block radius.,2257
25369,Bender,Of all time!,2257
25370,Zoidberg,"You-do-do-do. Boy-boy-boy-boy. Greetings, merchant! I need something beautiful and cheap for a lady who is one of those things.",2258
25371,Merchant,"The cheapest thing I have is a bouquet of daisies, for six dollars.",2258
25372,Zoidberg,"Perfect! I'll take half a bouquet of daisies, for three dollars!",2258
25373,Merchant,These flower sheers are so dull... and I'm already in debt to every knife sharpener in town.,2258
25374,Zoidberg,Allow... me.,2258
25375,Merchant,Aw! Thank you! That girlfriend of yours is one lucky lady.,2258
25376,Zoidberg,I'm gonna snip her off her feet!,2258
25377,Zoidberg,Zindy! You're even more beautiful from a distance!,2259
25378,Zindy,Johnny cakes! Good God! What's that horrible stench?!,2259
25379,Zoidberg,"Stench... Er er er... That's probably this stinky bus station, maybe!Come. Let's go some place well ventilated and grow old together.",2259
25380,Zoidberg,Ah! Much better.,2259
25381,Zindy,"It's even worse! It's like Comic-Con in a submarine! Oh... Oh, my God! The smell's coming from you!",2259
25382,Zoidberg,What? That? That's just my personal musk. You'll learn to love it! I know I did.,2259
25383,Zindy,"I'm sorry, Zoidberg. I can't see you anymore. Something's come up.It's vomit!",2259
25384,Zoidberg,I'd like to return these for a refund. Don't worry. They're... unused.,2259
25385,Merchant,Oh. I'm sorry. I get so little business I can't afford refunds. I don't know what's wrong with this location.,2259
25386,Zoidberg,I understand.,2259
25387,Merchant,Please don't cry. I can't stand to see a living thing feel pain. You are a... living thing. Right?,2259
25388,Zoidberg,Mhm. Can I have a refund now?,2259
25389,Roberto,"Ha ha! This here's a bayonet. It's some kinda kooky... half gun... half knife. Now empty out the register! And no bag, please. I care... about the environment.",2259
25390,Merchant,I... I have three dollars in mouldy pennies. It's all yours.,2259
25391,Roberto,That's generous of you.,2259
25392,Zoidberg,"Oh no you don't, Mister Big Jerk! I have nothing to live for, so I don't mind telling you... Those pennies are mine.",2259
25393,Roberto,Don't you get it? I'm craaaaaaazyyyyy! Ha ha!,2259
25394,Zoidberg,Go ahead! I don't care what happens anymore. Do it! Bash my head in.,2259
25395,Roberto,What is that? Mustard gas? That ain't legal. Ain't you hurtin' no Geneva convention?!,2259
25396,Merchant,That was amazing. Aw. You were so brave and frugal...,2259
25397,Zoidberg,I'm sorry. Don't hit me. Ooh... I like the way you hit! But I don't get it. Most women I've met can't even stand next to me without collapsing.,2259
25398,Merchant,What's wrong with those women?,2259
25399,Zoidberg,Well... some of them didn't have legs. But it's not them. It's me. How do I put this delicately? I'm smellier than a whorehouse's outhouse!,2259
25400,Merchant,"That's... terribly vivid. Doesn't matter to me, though. I was born with no sense of smell.",2259
25401,Zoidberg,Really?,2259

25443,Professor Farnsworth,Listen to Orange Joe. You must never let the girl know of this wonderful surgery!,2262
25444,Zoidberg,I dunno. It doesn't seem fair to Marianne. But on the other claw... maybe I can't live without her! So you're right. I can never tell her.,2262

25476,Leela,Don't you lay a hand on that angel!,2265
25477,Bender,Angel?! I've looked into her eyes and seen her soul! She's a monster.,2265
25478,Leela,"You're insane! Come on, Fry. Let's go.",2265
25479,Fry,"Okay.See ya, Bender.",2265
25480,Tonya,"The championship's mine, robot.",2265
25481,Bender,Why? Whyyyyy?! What did I not do yet to deserve this?!,2265
25482,Amy,Aw... I think it's noble of you to give Marianne a new nose.,2266
25483,Hermes,Yeah. She'll be forever grateful... from somewhere upwind.,2266
25484,Zoidberg,True. Our relationship will end once she smells my odour. But you know what would really stink? If Marianne spent her whole life never knowing the beautiful scent of her own flowers.,2266
25485,Bender,Dr Zoidberg! Help!,2266
25486,Fry,Bender?! What happened to your leg tube?,2266
25487,Bender,"I got beat up by a little girl. Please. Fix my knee, so I can get revenge at the tap-dance championship!",2266
25488,Zoidberg,"I don't have time for this, robut. Here. Patch yourself up with this medicinal wacky pack.  It's time!",2266
25489,Leela,I got a donor nose! There was an accident at the fencing academy.,2266
25490,Fry,Touché!,2266
25491,[Scene,"Outside Zoidberg's office. A piece of paper on the door reads """,2267
25492,Zoidberg,"It'll all be over soon, my love. May I have...  one last kiss?",2267
25493,Marianne,Aw. There'll be lots more.,2267
25494,Zoidberg,Yes. Lots.  Nurse Amy. The anesthesia.,2267
25495,Marianne,Smell you later.,2267
25496,Amy,She's out.,2267
25497,Zoidberg,Then let's begin this delicate procedure.,2267
25498,[Scene,"Outside the NNY Recreation Center. The sign now reads """,2268
25499,Randy,"Okay, dance maniacs. Let's have a big hand for our finalists — cute, little Tonya... and mean, old what's-his-name!",2268
25500,Tonya,Oops! Looks like you already did!,2268
25501,Bender,"You are an evil, heartless trough... so actually... we have a lot in common. In another life, we could've been friends.",2268
25502,Tonya,"No chance, garbage-can face!",2268
25503,Bender,Aw!,2268
25504,Randy,"Brace yourselves, 'cuz we're gonna try somethin' you would never see in mainstream tap — a simultaneous, head-to-head tap-off!",2268
25505,Professor Farnsworth,Wha?!,2268
25506,Mrs Astor,Scandalous!,2268
25507,Randy,"It's time for some fancy, shmancy dancy. Hit it, me!",2268
25508,Bender,Ooooh!,2268
25509,Fry,Ow! Bender!,2268
25510,Randy,Ew! Look at him dance! He don't care.,2268
25511,Tonya,"Try this, pegleg.",2268
25512,Bender,No sweat!,2268
25513,Randy,"Time's up, kittens. The judge has conferred and the vote is in. I pick her.",2268
25514,Tonya,"Thanks, Mister Nice Man. You know... the doctors say my heart doesn't work very good, but it feels good today, 'cuz I got to dance, and make people happy.",2268
25515,Bender,I never knew I could hate this much!,2268
25516,Leela,Bender! She's a sweet little girl!,2268
25517,Bender,She's a pig! I'm gonna tap-dance on her grave some day!,2268
25518,Leela,Ohhhhh!,2268
25519,Tonya,This... is the bestestest day of my whole— Gah!,2268
25520,Randy,"Oh, my God, people! She's having a heart attack! A cute little heart attack!",2268
25521,Dr Cahill,"I'm a doctor, and yes. They're real. Clear!",2268
25522,Marianne,How did it go?,2268
25523,Zoidberg,"Just perfect. This time, you can describe their beautiful aroma to me.",2268
25524,Marianne,What is that horrible stench?,2268
25525,Zoidberg,"I don't know how to tell you this, but...",2268
25526,Marianne,It's these flowers! Bluh-ah!,2268
25527,Zoidberg,It's not the flowers. It's—,2268
25528,Marianne,Much better. You smell just like I dreamed you would.,2268
25529,Zoidberg,But but... But but... most people think I smell like a burning zoo!,2268
25530,Marianne,"I never learned a good smell from a bad smell, but I like the way you smell... because I like you.",2268
25531,Amy,It's so beautiful!,2268
25532,Dr Cahill,I'm sorry. She's gone.,2268
25533,Bender,"Woohoo! In your dead face, little girl! I'm not even gonna wait to dance on your grave. I'm gonna dance on your corpse, right now.",2268
25534,Randy,"Oh, my God!",2268
25535,Fry,"No, Bender! What're you doin'?! No!",2268
25536,Leela,Bender! Stop!,2268
25537,Randy,The robot has to go!,2268
25538,Bender,Huh?! What's that?,2268
25539,Tonya,I took a nappie!,2268
25540,Dr Cahill,I don't believe it. She's alive! Bender's rhythmic chest compressions restarted her heart.,2268
25541,Randy,He's a big ol' hero!,2268
25542,Bender,No. I was... tryin'... Hey. Wait. I... Come on. What...,2268
25543,Tonya,Just 'cuz you saved my life doesn't mean I won't beat you down again.,2269
25544,Bender,"Man. You are irredeemably evil. Together, we shall rule the galaxy!",2269
25545,Hattie,"Aw... What an adorable, little kajigger.",2269
25546,Bender,Now!,2269
25547,Zoidberg,Ah. Nothing like the first cup of dumpster juice in the morning. Marianne?!,2269
25548,Marianne,"Yes.Listen. I've got a new job, and... well... I'm going to have to dump you.",2269
25549,Zoidberg,I'd like that!,2269
