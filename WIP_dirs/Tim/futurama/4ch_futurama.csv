730,No A taxdeductible mission of charity,Farnsworth
734,Its a sunny little doomed planet inhabited by a number of frisky little doomed animals,Farnsworth
736,Thats right Animals in desperate need of rescue You see Vergon 6 was once filled with a superdense substance known as dark matter each pound of which weighs over ten thousand  pounds,Farnsworth
737,Wait What about the animals,Leela
738,Well dark matter is extremely valuable as starship fuel Thats why it was all mined out leaving the planet completely hollow,Farnsworth
739,Yes but what about the animals,Leela
742,I didnt say anything about animals Now it seems that the planet will collapse within three days Incidentally this will kill all the animals,Farnsworth
743,So we have to bring back two of each kind Just like Noahs Ark,Leela
745,I bet you Leelas holding out for a nice guy with one eye,Fry
746,Thatll take forever What she oughta do is find a nice guy with two eyes then poke one out,Bender
747,Yeah thatd be a timesaver,Fry
749,Here you go  You can use this as an eyepoker,Bender

784,Wow I never would have thought of that,Fry
787,Captain Brannigan we really need to talk to you about our mission,Leela
790,Were hoping to save the animals of Vergon 6 from extinction And if you could just,Leela
794,But people already interfered That planet was mined completely hollow,Leela

798,Fine Well save the animals without your help,Leela
801,Hes throwing us in prison,Bender
802,Dang Can I get this wrapped up,Fry

804,You really are too picky,Bender
819,Good This will be my chance to reason with him captain to captain,Leela
823,I didnt realise you were such a coinasewer,Leela
827,If we could speak seriously for a moment,Leela
829,Id like you to reconsider letting us rescue those animals,Leela
833,We can definitely escape Bender All you have to do is bend the hatch off this steam pipe,Fry
835,No good Its full of steam,Fry
837,Im not really in the mood,Leela

858,Zapp last night was a mistake,Leela
860,No just a regular mistake For a split second my common sense was overwhelmed by pity,Leela
862,The only kind of crawling Im doing to you is away  from,Leela
864,Look Im going down to Vergon 6 to save those animals whether you like it or not,Leela
866,Threaten all you Wait What,Leela

917,Look are you going to rescue us or not,Leela
923,I would never abandon a helpless animal Yknow Zapp once I thought you were a big pompous buffoon Then I realised that inside you were just a pitiful child But now I realise that outside that child is a big pompous buffoon,Leela
925,Wow Way to tell that guy off Now whats your secret escape plan,Fry
926,Uh I guess to sit here and wait for death,Leela
930,I dont believe it Its dark matter,Leela
931,So this guy just unloaded a steaming pile of starship fuel,Bender
932,His species mustve filled the entire planet with it Did you do that you cute little  Come on That should be more than enough fuel to get us outta here Bender pick it up and put it in the engine,Leela
933,We made it  And some of the animals survived,Leela
934,So a couple of animals didnt die and Leela got lucky Thats what I call a successful mission,Bender
941,What do you think of the view Fry,Leela
942,It really puts things in perspective I mean from up here an entire world can seem utterly insignificant,Fry
943,Hey nice seats Were close enough so when you knock a player down with a beer bottle he stays down,Bender
944,I dont get it Is blernsball exactly the same as baseball,Fry
946,Face it Fry Baseball was as boring as mum and apple pie Thats why they jazzed it up,Leela
947,Boring Baseball wasnt  hmm so they finally jazzed it up,Fry
950,What just happened Why is the ball on that springy thing,Fry
951,Its traditional Just like aluminium bats and the seventh inning grope,Leela
952,I got me a souvenir  Aww here you go kid,Bender

959,Hey buddies who wants popcorn,Bender
961,Anyone want butter on that,Bender
962,Hey Im starting to get the hang of this game The blerns are loaded the counts three blerns and two antiblerns and the infield blern rule is in effect right,Fry
963,Except for the word blern that was complete gibberish The blernsball falls into a hole and indescribable mayhem ensues Fry scratches his head in confusion Leela writes on her score card All right Yes,Leela
965,Millers on a pace to hit 70 blerns,Leela
966,Hes good all right But hes no Clem Johnson And Johnson played back in the days when steroid injections were mandatory,Farnsworth
967,Clem Johnson That skin bag wouldnt have lasted one pitch in the old Robot Leagues Now Wireless Joe Jackson there was a blern hitting machine,Bender
968,Exactly He was a machine designed to hit blerns I mean come on Wireless Joe was nothing but a programmable bat on wheels,Leela
969,Oh and I suppose pitching at 5000 was just a modified howitzer,Bender
971,You humans are so scared of a little robot competition you wont even let us on the field,Bender
972,What are you talking about Theres all kinds of robots down there,Fry
973,Yeah doing crap work Theyre bat boys ball polishers sprinkler systems But how many robot managers are there,Bender
975,Zero  And what a surprise Look whos scraping up the filth Is it a human child I wish,Bender

984,Ive never made anyones life easier and you know it,Bender
985,Great news everyone Youll be delivering a package to Chapek 9 A world where humans are killed on sight,Farnsworth
987,Im glad you asked that question Fry You see Chapek 9 was colonised centuries ago by a murderous crew of radical robot separatists,Farnsworth
988,Oh so just cause a robot wants to kill humans that makes him a radical,Bender
989,Hey hold on I understand these robots hate humans but how do they feel about humanoid aliens,Leela
992,Oh I get it make the robot do all the work,Bender

999,It wasnt just a blast it was a sacred tribute to my ancestral prototypes which happened to take the form of a drinking contest,Bender
1001,All right Ill go But so help me Ill hold a grudge against every last one of you for the rest of your lives,Bender
1002,Well then its settled So long everyone,Farnsworth

1501,Its salt with water in it if thats what you mean,Bender
1502,My visions fading I think Im gonna die,Fry
1503,There was nothing wrong with that food The salt level was 10 less than a lethal dose,Bender
1505,OK Fry heres the package to deliver And for once in your life be careful This is my first visit to the Galaxy of Terror and Id like it to be a pleasant one,Leela
1507,Dont touch anything or talk to anyone Just go to the palace drop it off and come right back,Leela

1509,Stupid slug Ive never been so thirsty  Ah,Fry
1515,I didnt mean to He just looked so cool and refreshing,Fry
1519,So after I specifically asked you not to touch anything you drank a bottle of strange blue liquid It could have been poisonous acid,Leela
1520,It could have been But chances were equally good it was an Emperor,Fry
1525,You know Fry Ive often thought about becoming a Prime Minister,Bender
1527,Yes In your face Gorgak,Bender
1528,Thats it Fry As your captain I order you back to the ship You are in way over your head,Leela
1529,Gee you think so Captain Id better check with my Prime Minister,Fry
1532,Hey thanks  Wow This got here just in time,Fry
1536,On second thought Ill take that one,Fry
1538,Does anyone else think its odd that a shiftless 25yearold delivery boy could drop out of the sky kill the emperor and be rewarded instead of punished,Leela
1539,You dont have to beat around the bush Leela We all know who youre talking about  uh me right,Fry
1546,There wont be a lot of longwinded speeches will there,Fry

1561,Damn I knew you wouldnt have asked unless it was really high or really low,Fry
1562,Every Emperor ascended to power by assassinating the previous one And guess whos next,Leela
1563,Well at least my assassin will get whats coming to him,Fry
1564,Youre in tremendous danger you idiot Half of these Emperors were drunk at their own coronation,Leela
1565,Hey I plan on having a few brewskis myself,Fry
1566,No they were assassinated In fact the law says youll be killed on the spot if you fail to recite the oath from memory,Leela
1567,Yeah I was going to thumb through that later,Fry
1568,That is completely reckless Dont you ever think ahead,Leela
1569,Hell no If I stopped to think ahead I wouldnt be Emperor And I wouldnt even be here in the year 3000 Its just like the story of the grasshopper and the octopus All year long the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter while the octopus mooched off his girlfriend and watched TV But then the winter came and the grasshopper died and the octopus ate all his acorns and also he got a racecar Is any of this getting through to you,Fry
1570,I give up Youre gonna get yourself killed and this time I wont be here to save you,Leela
1571,Who asked you to I told you a hundred times to stop treating me like a baby Now go Go gather your nuts you nagging grasshopper,Fry

1644,All Leela ever wanted to do was help me But I was to proud too stupid to accept it  I wish I had died instead of her,Fry
1645,What are you talking about,Leela
1648,I told Fry you were dead so he would cry out the Emperor but you had to go and wreck it by surviving,Bender

1734,So this things gonna destroy the whole city  What the heck is it,Fry
1735,Ah Just as I thought The answer lies in this movie I found on the Internet,Farnsworth
1737,Wow You got that off the Internet  In my day the Internet was only used to download pornography,Fry
1738,Actually thats still true,Farnsworth
1741,So thats the situation Due to the shortsightedness of Old New York New New York is going to be destroyed by a giant ball of garbage,Farnsworth
1742,Fry what the hell were you people thinking back then How could you just throw your garbage away,Leela
1743,Hey gimmie a break What do you do with it,Fry

1758,No Im here because a giant trash ball is heading straight for us Smell for yourself,Farnsworth
1772,Cant we just shoot a missile at it,Leela
1774,But suppose we send a crew to plant an explosive precisely on the fault line between this mass of coffee grounds and this deposit of America Online floppy disks,Farnsworth
1778,Now youll only have one chance to destroy the ball After that it will be so close to Earth that blowing it up would cause garbage to rain over the entire planet killing billions,Farnsworth
1780,Now heres the bomb Ive prepared Once you activate it youll have 25 minutes to get away,Farnsworth
1782,Now now therell be plenty of time to discuss your objections when and if you return,Farnsworth

1806,No its my fault too Im sure I threw out more than my share of that trash up there Also one month my toilet broke and it just went straight in the garbage can  Leela was right The people of the 20th century were idiotic slobs Especially me,Fry
1821,Wait If we could build an object the exact size density and consistency of the garbage ball it might just knock the ball away without smashing it to bits,Farnsworth
1822,But where can we find a substance the exact density and consistency as garbage,Leela
1825,Good Lord A second ball of garbage That just might work,Farnsworth
1827,Then its time to make some more,Fry
1829,Stand back and watch the master This Slurm can  Pure garbage Now you try it,Fry

10065,Ooh Let Bubblegum tell it,Bender
10069,Their gravity might just divert the Chronitons to the empty side of the universe,Farnsworth
10075,Ah there we are One gravity pump  Powerful enough to move the stars themselves Now to begin the arduous task of attaching it to the ship so th,Farnsworth

10125,Oh its hopeless I did something so great that it won Leelas heart and Ill never ever know what it was My life is empty,Fry
10127,No wonder we failed to stop the time skips Diverting Chronitons is mathematically impossible I knew I should have checked your showboating Globetrotter algebra,Farnsworth
10130,The time skips are worse than ever now Isolated spots are jumping by years at a time Look,Farnsworth
10133,Well Im stumped Well have to call in the finest scientific minds in the univ,Farnsworth
10134,Perhaps we could explode the whole damned nebula What do you think Curly Joe,Farnsworth

13033,Look Bender this has nothing to do with you,Fry
13035,Now if youll excuse me Im working on Seymours doghouse,Fry
13036,No one ever asks if Bender would like to live in a tiny little house Not that I would A tiny little house that says Bender on it  Ow,Bender
13037,This is Fry If youre calling about the used towels for sale theyre still available for 45 each,Fry
13046,Are you two gonna be done soon,Fry

13074,I hate you I hate you You evil metal man  Ow,Fry
13075,So anyway your dog is melted Now were friends again,Bender
13076,Not necessarily For the dog may yet survive,Farnsworth
13078,Indeed You see that fossil was made of dolomite The tough black mineral that wont cop out when theres heat all about By contrast observe the lavas affect on this ice swan  Of course that would have melted even at room temperature I just wanted to get rid of it But had it been made of that righteous mineral dolomite theres a slim chance it might have survived,Farnsworth
13079,So Seymour might still exist,Fry
13080,Perhaps for a few minutes Its dolomite baby,Farnsworth
13081,Then Im goin in after him,Fry
13085,Acting like a moron wont bring your dog back,Leela
13086,Then all hope is lost  Goodbye Seymour,Fry
13087,Please stop crying Fry Here  I assumed you were just pretending to love the dog to toy with my emotions Oh what have I done,Bender
13089,Fry Im sorry I should have understood how someone can love an inferior creature because I love you Not in the way of the Ancient Greeks but the way a robot loves a human a human loves a dog and occasionally a gorilla loves a kitty  Im goin in,Bender
13090,Im a professor Why isnt anyone listening to me You cant go in because youll melt The fossil only has a chance because its made of dolomite,Farnsworth

13775,But we have to The world needs Star Trek to give people hope for the future,Fry
13776,But its set 800 years in the past,Leela
13777,Yeah why is this so important to you,Bender
13778,Cause itit taught me so much Like how you should accept people whether they be black white Klingon or even female But most importantly when I didnt have any friends it made me feel like maybe I did,Fry
13779,Well that is touchingly pathetic I guess I cant let you go alone,Leela
13780,Ill go too with Leonards permission of course,Bender

13856,This is wrong We shouldnt have abandoned them there,Fry
13857,I dunno Im feeling pretty good about it,Bender
13858,I didnt wanna leave them either Fry but what are we supposed to do,Leela
13859,Well usually on the show someone would come up with a complicated plan then explain it with a simple analogy,Fry
13860,Hmm If we can reroute engine power through the primary weapons and reconfigure them to Melllvars frequency that should overload his electroquantum structure,Leela
13861,Like putting too much air in a balloon,Bender
13862,Of course Its so simple,Fry
13870,OK Im done rekafoobling the energy motron  or whatever,Bender
13873,Its not working Hes drawing straight from our weapons,Leela
13874,Like a balloon and  something bad happens,Fry
13876,So uh hows rehearsal going,Leela
13883,Whered you get an idiotic idea like that,Bender
13885,Great list Except you forgot episode 66,Fry
13888,Can we get on with this My foots getting tired,Leela
13896,There We can make these into spears,Leela
13897,And we can tie these caterpillars together to make bow strings for bows and arrows,Fry
13898,And we can use this machine gun to shoot them Yeehaw  That was fun,Bender
13909,Then do it the wrong way,Leela
13911,Is that all youve got Hiyah,Leela
13925,All this time we thought he was a powerful superbeing yet he was just a child,Fry
13927,Alright Koenig Ive wanted to do this for years,Bender
13928,Bender wait This is our chance to escape before Melllvar comes back But we all need to work together,Fry
13931,Weve decided to work together,Fry
13934,We cant use our ship we have life support but the engines are wrecked,Leela
13936,Hey if your engines work,Leela
13938,Stop Youre just goin around in circles  Think Fry think Everyones depending on you,Fry
13939,Were too heavy You guys need to lose some weight fast,Leela

13949,One more hit and were done for,Leela
13951,Thanks a lot Takei now everybody knows,Bender
13953,Wait If they mean that much to you why do you wanna kill them,Fry
13955,Melllvar you cant let a TV show be your whole life You can do anything you want Look at Walter Koenig,Fry
13958,Whoa whoa One step at a time,Fry
13960,Episode 10 Balance of Terror,Fry
13967,And all you had to put up with was one really annoying Star Trek fan,Fry
13969,A hush comes over the crowd The only sound is Bender calling everyone else a jerk as he swings  Boy I tell you buddy,Bender
13970,Bad news everyone Youre not good enough to go on your next mission,Farnsworth
13974,Because And says me Its an extremely dangerous mission that killed my last crew And youre not nearly as good as them,Farnsworth
13976,We live to suck another day,Bender
13977,Were just as good as any of those other crews you sent to their deaths Whats the mission,Leela
13978,Collecting honey Ordinary honey,Farnsworth
13979,That doesnt sound so dangerous,Leela
13980,This is no ordinary honey Its produced by vicious space bees A single sting of their hideous neurotoxin can cause instant death,Farnsworth
13982,Your insides will boil out of your eye sockets like a science fair volcano,Farnsworth
13984,These bees are larger than most Buicks and twice as ugly,Farnsworth
13985,Larger than an American sedan  How big is the honeycomb,Fry
13989,Itll take more than deadly deadly bees to keep us from doing our job Come on boys,Leela
13991,Listen Im scared too But Im more scared of disappointing myself,Leela
13992,Im not scared of that at all,Fry
13993,Now bees communicate by dancing,Leela
13994,Like my parents Oh wait that was hitting,Fry
13995,So this language cartridge will let you distract them,Leela
13996,Ah good I often have thoughts and feelings that can only be expressed through dance  You stink Benders great Deal with it,Bender
13997,Bender quick Waggle something,Leela
13998,Uh   Hello fellow bees Hows the abdomen Swollen with nectar I trust,Bender

14038,This makes me the oldest member of my family,Farnsworth
14040,All those times I said Kill all humans Id always whisper except one Fry was that one  And I never told him so,Bender
14042,I feel funny Haha funny,Leela
14044,Fry I thought you were dead,Leela
14045,Nope Im better than ever Before the accident I couldnt do this,Fry
14046,Impressive But it does sorta support my youaredead theory,Leela
14047,Then Ill prove Im alive by telling you something only I could know  Theres a surprise for you in my locker I got it at a Swedish novelty shop before we left,Fry
14048,Its too beautiful to open Can I open it,Leela
14049,Sure Theres just one thing I want you to do,Fry
14053,In my dream Fry said he hid a gift for me in his locker If its true then he must still exist in some form,Leela
14054,Of course he still exists,Farnsworth
14057,Well I feel better now Pawning all the stuff in Frys locker helped give me closure,Bender
14058,Was there anything in there that might have been a gift for me,Leela
14059,No Nothing Not at all No way José  Here it is,Bender
14060,You took this from Frys locker,Leela
14061,Hey the guys dead Theres no law against grave robbing,Bender
14062,That proves it Fry is alive somewhere and hes reaching me in my dreams,Leela
14064,Lay down here and well do some tests If Fry is out there then Leelas brain could be acting as a fivepound Ouija board,Farnsworth
14065,Is this some sort of brain scanner,Leela
14066,Some sort yes In France its called a guillotine,Farnsworth
14067,Professor Cant you examine my brain without removing it,Leela
14069,Hey what if Fry wasnt actually dead when we buried him Yknow like Julia Roberts,Bender
14070,Well I suppose theres a slim  I dont believe it,Farnsworth
14071,What is it Is Fry alive in some other dimension or something,Leela
14072,No According to this gizmometer Fry is dead and nothing can bring him back Remarkable,Farnsworth
14073,But  my dream Your science cant unprove that How could I have known the gift was in Frys locker,Leela
14075,Are you saying Im going crazy,Leela
14076,No no No ones saying that But Im certainly thinking it loudly,Farnsworth
14077,Hi Leela Im just gonna keep talking even if you cant hear me Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah,Fry
14078,Shut up I can hear you The Professor says youre just a dream,Leela
14079,Oh yeah  Could a dream take you dancing in a Venusian garden,Fry
14080,Well yes technically But its still very sweet of you,Leela
14081,Then what if we shared a sleigh ride across the ice fields of Hyperion,Fry
14082,Oh Fry You must be alive Ive never been treated so romantically by my own imagination before,Leela
14083,Here take my jacket You look a little cold,Fry

14105,I need to calm down Id better take some more of that space honey,Leela
14106,Youve been taking space honey Be careful you purplehaired imbecile,Farnsworth
14110,One spoonful to calm me down  Is that you I dont need a sponge,Leela
14111,Why am I sticky and naked Did I miss something fun,Fry
14112,Incredible According to the gizmometer Fry touched the royal jelly in the space hive leaving an imprint of his DNA and brainwaves Then when it spilled on the couch it recombined with trace amounts of Frys hair and skin,Farnsworth
14113,And blood Dont forget about Frys blood,Bender
14114,Yes Bender thank you In short the various fluids Fry left in the couch caused the royal jelly to regenerate his entire being,Farnsworth
14116,This is great My buddys alive and his credit cards are valid again  Lets go get hammered,Bender
14118,Fry Im so glad I didnt kill you,Leela

14167,In the hospital The ambulance took you here right after the bee stung you,Fry
14168,But the bee stung you It barely touched me,Leela
14169,The stinger went right through me and you got all the poison My new spleen came from a guy who liked to motorcycle,Fry
14171,You were in the best coma Ive ever seen,Bender
14173,Really How long was I out,Leela
14176,I though that maybe if you heard a familiar voice it might help keep your mind together But who knows if it really got through,Fry
14177,It got through Fry  It got through,Leela
14178,You could really use a shower,Leela
14181,So who should I root for America or one of those countries I learned about at the food court,Fry
14183,No theyre from the Republic of French Stereotypes Everybody hates them,Leela
14184,Oh lets go check on Hermes All this inspiring multiculturalism is angrying up my blood  Sweden I dont think so,Farnsworth
14187,It does seem like Jamaica will be able to field a strong limbo team without you,Leela
14192,But have they seen your  yknow  physique since the old days,Fry
14194,Dont worry The fat pig will do fine thanks to this flabbodynamic spandex bodysuit Ive designed  It redistributes his weight shifting his centre of gravity closer to his knees,Farnsworth
14196,Now thats a limboers body,Farnsworth
14198,Shut up Zoidberg The robot bending events are starting  Wow That guy must be like the worlds greatest bender My dreams of glory died before they began,Bender
14215,Well enough about Hermes I couldnt win a medal either Even at bending the thing I was built to do Im so embarrassed I wish everybody else was dead,Bender
14217,Fembots  Methinks a clever Manbot suitably disguised might win those events But the charade would require subtlety nuance grace,Bender
14218,What do you mean Im not registered My name is Coilette and Im from uh  Robonia Coilettes a chicks name,Bender
14220,Ever been beaten up by a guy dressed like a chick,Bender

14227,Wait Ive got it Professor make a woman out of me,Bender
14228,Oh I think we should just stay friends,Farnsworth
14229,I dont need friends I need a sex change operation and give it to me now,Bender
14230,Bender a robot sex change is a complex and dangerous procedure Replacing your testosteroil with Fembot lubricants can cause wild mood swings And the effects may be irreversible Well lets get started,Farnsworth
14234,Im sorry ladies but I must do this Not for you not for Bender but for the proud people of Robonia,Farnsworth
14236,I cant watch this cause its creepy and wrong and sick However I will watch out of curiosity,Fry
14237,Im about to begin the process of reshaping Benders body into a tender delicate form,Farnsworth
14238,Draining male oil  Removing item,Farnsworth
14244,I dont know which Im more,Leela
14247,But youre not really a lady anyway Right,Fry
14249,Dear Lord A coaster The Femmzoil must be sacheting girlishly into your processor,Farnsworth
14271,Well I think you dating a Manbot is a disgrace and I refuse to be involved And you have way too much lipstick on,Leela
14276,But what if he wants to I mean if he tries to  uh  Barry White,Fry
14280,Oh dear Her mood swings are getting wilder Shes becoming a slave to her emotions Just like all women Particularly you Leela,Farnsworth

14328,OK look If I help you with this do you promise to get out of my gender and stay out,Leela
14330,Alright Now theres no way to stop this marriage without hurting Calculon But hes an actor If theres one kind of pain he can handle its soap opera pain,Leela
14344,You really thought you could steal those diamonds from me and Congo Jack,Leela
14350,Yes And I have a message for you from Colonel Mitumbay He says this    is from Congo Jack,Fry
14359,Turn off that craporama One mistake now and Bender will be trapped forever between the already illdefined robot sexes,Farnsworth
14361,Well Bender I hope this has taught you a lesson about changing your sex to win five gold medals,Fry
14365,Drive to Vegas pick up some Flooziebots and void their warranties all night long,Bender
14366,Yay My buddys home And his respect for women is back to normal,Fry
14367,I kind of hoped this whole experience would have left you a little more open to your sensitive side,Leela

14564,This one time I pounded a guy into the ground like a stake with a shovel,Bender
14567,No peeking  I dont know whats in there but Im sure our minds would be unable to comprehend it,Farnsworth
14569,I dont care  Pretty tantalising though,Farnsworth
14570,Whatevers in there its the only thing Ive ever wanted,Fry
14573,Right If they try to look in the box,Leela
14575,Lets just forget about the box The Professor said to stay away,Fry

14583,That oughta keep those dopes occupied  I can guard the real box in peace now that no ones curious about it,Leela
14584,Well I got through the night and no one looked in the box Not even me The person who gave up her whole evening to watch it A whole evening of TV gone What a mockery of justice that I cant take even a little tiny peek  Oh its deep Deeper than a small box should be,Leela
14585,Ouch My lawyer will hear about this,Leela
14586,Leela what have you done,Fry
14587,Nothing What do you mean Why was I looking in the box,Leela
14588,I mean your hair Its all differenty,Fry
14590,You know it Large and in charge,Bender
14591,Leela Oh theres a woman for you Always dyeing her hair instead of not looking in a box,Farnsworth
14592,I didnt dye my hair This is how I always look,Leela
14593,No thats how you always look  This throws my entire perception of reality into question Clone Robot Or longlost twin Taking all bets I also offer video poker,Bender
14594,Its some guy wearing a Leela costume Get him,Fry
14595,Hold it You have this all wrong I just fell into the box and then I fell out somehow,Leela
14597,No wait Ive got it I know whats in the box Oh Ive been as dumb as Fry,Farnsworth
14599,It contains a parallel universe And when you create a parallel universe its almost always populated by evil twins,Farnsworth
14601,Oh youd like us to believe that wouldnt you Leela Or should I say Evila,Farnsworth
14602,Oh this is awful Somewhere theres a Bender more evil than me I do my best damnit,Bender
14604,I tell you theyre not evil But dont be confused They are jerks,Leela
14608,Come out of your universe with your hands up,Leela
14609,Oh wow Its like that drug trip I saw in that movie when I was on that drug trip,Fry
14610,Astonishing I must have created a parallel universe,Farnsworth
14611,Baldercrap I created your universe All you created was my fist parallel to your face,Farnsworth
14613,Look it doesnt matter who created what The important thing is Yah,Leela
14614,Were exactly the same I know all her moves Therefore Ive got the upper hand,Leela
14615,Now now Perfectly symmetrical violence never solved anything,Farnsworth
14616,Lets recap whats happened so far  As you can see I accidentally created a box containing your universe,Farnsworth
14617,While I in a simultaneous blunder created a box containing your universe,Farnsworth
14618,This is getting confusing Why dont we call our universe Universe A and this universe Universe B,Leela
14619,Hey Why cant we be Universe A,Bender
14624,We called it first Besides this place kinda feels like a B yknow,Fry
14625,Alright you can be crummy Universe A and well be Universe 1,Leela
14626,Or The Mongooses Thats a cool team name The Fighting Mongooses,Fry
14627,Wait a second If everyone is identical why did our Leela look into the box and your Leela didnt,Farnsworth
14628,Well to be honest I tossed a coin It came up tails so I didnt look,Leela
14629,Thats weird Mine came up heads so I did,Leela
14630,Interesting Apparently the key difference between our universes is that coin flips have opposite outcomes,Farnsworth
14631,That explains fruity here  I tossed a coin to pick my finish Fog hat grey,Bender
14632,Hey Bite my glorious golden ass,Bender
14633,You people and your slight differences disgust me Im going home Wheres that blue box with our universe in it,Farnsworth
14634,Oh youd like to get back to your evil universe wouldnt you And destroy your box with our universe inside it,Farnsworth
14635,Nonsense I would never do such a thing unless you were already having been going to do that,Farnsworth
14638,In any case Ive hidden the box and it will remain hidden until Im convinced youre not evil  Everyone keep an eye on your evil counterpart,Farnsworth
14639,And you all do the same,Farnsworth
14640,Um can Fry and I watch our parallel selves together We have plans tonight,Leela
14643,Ive got my eye on you boy,Bender
14644,Dont even think about it lunchpail Youd be dead before you hit the ground,Bender
14645,Good point Whattya say we just hit a strip joint,Bender
14646,I was waitin for one of us to say that  Bender A youre a prince among robots Can you forgive me for distrusting you,Bender
14647,Aw I cant stay mad at what is essentially me I love me,Bender
14652,So Fry Leela howd you two get together,Leela
14653,Funny story I asked Leela out a million times but she just kept rejecting me,Fry
14654,Id make up stuff like I have sweaty boot rash or I have to meet the President,Leela
14655,Oh man you never heard such excuses But like a dope I believed her Looking back on it now its kinda funny,Fry
14656,It sure is Right Leela Funny Ha ha ha ha,Fry
14657,Then one night when Fry asked me out the only excuse I could think of involved ghosts I knew he wouldnt buy it so I did what I always do in those situations,Leela
14659,I flipped a coin It came up heads and we went out,Leela
14660,You mean you flipped a coin too And it was tails So thats why you said you had to meet that ghost,Fry
14661,You really missed out on something Leela That date was magical,Leela
14662,One year later I gave Leela a diamond scrunchie and we were married,Fry
14664,One year later I got beat up at a Neil Diamond concert by a guy named Scrunchie,Fry
14665,Well that was pointless,Farnsworth
14666,Say I hope you wont think it evil of me to ask how you got that stylish head wound,Farnsworth
14667,Oh this old thing I was experimenting to see if I could remove my own brain,Farnsworth
14668,Of course I had the same idea I flipped a coin to decide if I should proceed But it came up tails so I didnt Howd it go,Farnsworth
14669,Well getting the brain out was the easy part The hard part was getting the brain out,Farnsworth
14681,After carefully reading the scriptures weve concluded that none of us are evil,Farnsworth
14682,Yes the Bible is the real good news Anyhow youre all free to go back to your own universe,Farnsworth
14684,Hermes arent you curious about the fact that theres two of everybody,Leela
14686,Your granny can go to hell Ive hidden the box so no one can destroy the home universe of my handsome friend here,Farnsworth
14687,Oh go on Wait a second If your Hermes was about to destroy the box containing our universe,Farnsworth
14692,So we go back through the box and stop Hermes,Leela
14693,Right Good thing Professor B there hid it in the coelacanth tank No one but a crazy lobster would look there,Farnsworth
14702,Now dont give up yet you cry babies The box is gone but we still have one preposterously slim hope,Farnsworth
14704,No We must attempt to make another box containing our universe Doy,Farnsworth
14705,Well Is that your universe in there,Fry
14707,Ill put this one aside for later,Farnsworth
14709,Yes its the apocalypse alright I always thought Id have a hand in it,Farnsworth
14710,Im not sad because I finally found someone as great as me Its like I always say Make new friends and keep the old One is silver,Bender
14713,The idiots have the box,Leela
14718,Oh lets all ask each other Thatll solve this problem,Farnsworth
14719,Well each have to search a universe Everyone grab a length of wire first so you can find your way back,Farnsworth
14722,Yo Uh did two shellfish in scrubs go by,Fry
14726,Uh have you robot versions of you guys seen any extra Zoidbergs around here,Leela
14727,Negative Will you go out with me,Fry

14753,Yknow lets just say its heads,Leela
14755,and  One two three pull,Farnsworth
14756,There That spacetime eversion has given us their box and vice versa,Farnsworth
14757,So what you think you just explained to us is that,Leela
14758,Correct This box contains our own universe,Farnsworth
14760,Bender Quit destroying the universe,Leela
14762,Yes all that is and ever shall be is in that box And the box itself is probably worth something too We must cherish it as we cherish every moment of our lives,Farnsworth

17087,I was raised in an orphanarium My parents are sewer mutants who I never even met until a few years ago,Leela
17090,Bender please dont get mad but I think you might be playing too much Dungeons  Dragons,Fry
17091,Youre absolutely right Fry I almost went insane but after this hearttoheart talk Ive decided to quit,Bender
17092,Really Whew Thats a load off my toad,Fry
17093,"Now if youll excuse me 
Bender",Bender
17096,Foul dragon meet thy doom,Bender
17099,Satisfied Zoidberg My relationship with my parents is fine,Leela
17104,"Mom hes a cockroach from outer space 
Turanga Morris",Leela

17106,Prepare for a surprise attack,Bender
17108,I would but  Ow Take my collar off,Leela
17110,"I cast upon thee a spell of fireball 
Zoidberg",Bender
17111,Beholdeth Titanius I cast a freeze ray upon you,Fry
17112,Thats ridiculous Theres no such thing as a freeze ray What you mean a cone of coldness,Bender
17114,"No No Fancy men are defenseless against cone of coldness 
Fry",Bender
17119,I make use of my rod of fireballs,Bender
17120,The collar will be triggered any time your thoughts turn to violence,Farnsworth
17122,Bender I think you might be  playing too much Dungeons  Dragons,Fry
17123,Youre absolutely right Fry,Bender
17128,Says who Was it the bugbear Is he talking about me again,Bender
17130,Poor Bender Says here to tell his friends hes at a spa,Fry
17135,Ow Can you please remove this anger collar,Leela
17139,Quiet everyone The network news is on and if I a 165yearold man dont watch it who will,Farnsworth
17151,Greedy old hag taste the wrath of my fuzzy slipper,Farnsworth
17152,Professor why are you so hot and dusty over this dark matter shortage,Leela
17153,Oohh I bet youd like to know I bet youd like to know indeed,Farnsworth
17165,I just bet youd like to know why Im so angry about this dark matter shortage I bet very much youd like to know,Farnsworth
17167,Really I didnt think anyone was interested It all started 30odd years ago  I was working in Moms laboratories for the third time after twice before realizing how evil she was and vowing never to work for her again But somehow the rich wrong stench of her boney charms kept calling me back,Farnsworth
17169,Back in those days dark matter was just a worthless inert curiosity and I was smashing it in a particle accelerator in an illconceived attempt to create a more durable harpsichord wax But as Deepak Chopra taught us quantum physics means anything can happen at any time for no reason Also eat plenty of oatmeal and animals never had a war Whos the real animals  And thus against all probabilities it happened The dark matter particles in the particle accelerator begin colliding and exploding A large explosion leaves only a single item  the single nonlocal metaparticle crystal,Farnsworth
17171,Im sure I dont need to explain that all dark matter in the universe is linked in the form of a single nonlocal metaparticle,Farnsworth
17173,So in one instant I had transformed all dark matter everywhere into a new crystalline form  making it the most potent fuel since primitive man first ignited mastodon flatulence to heat his cave,Farnsworth
17181,Professor maybe I can help you get even with Mom I spend most of my time thinking about how to get revenge on a bad boss,Leela
17186,Thanks but that wont be necessary because I have the ultimate weapon  You see in the instant the energy crystal was created there also came into being an opposite crystal made of pure antibackwards energy,Farnsworth
17189,So this If ever the two crystals should meet their wave functions would collapse like Raymond Burrs trampoline once again rendering all dark matter inert and useless as fuel,Farnsworth
17191,But once we free society from dependence on Moms dark matter scientists will finally care enough to develop cleaner alternative fuels,Farnsworth
17193,No not me Im too busy developing makeup for dogs Thats where the money is,Farnsworth
17194,This is our chance to teach Mom a lesson Lets take the anticrystal and shove it up Moms regular crystal,Leela
17197,Theres just one small problem and its a big one I hid the crystal and I cant remember where,Farnsworth
17199,Dont you think I already tried that No Im afraid the crystal is lost forever,Farnsworth
17214,Look we have to accept the fact that we all have a serious problem,Bender
17218,Theres a band of river trolls living in the moat and they may have no intention of letting us out of this castle unless we hand over the Golden Scepter of Zanthor,Bender
17221,I know not of this Bender I am Titanius Anglesmith fancy man of Cornwood,Bender
17225,Far from it If you ask me they look like a bunch of hookers But what I have invented is a means of locating the missing crystal  When I push this button the crystal will emit a highfrequency stink,Farnsworth
17227,There Now with any luck Ill detect it with my smelling aid  I just pray to all powerful Atheismo that we find it before Mom does,Farnsworth
17229,No damn it Just the alluring scent of Obsession for spaniels,Farnsworth
17241,Oh great What do we got Wall gophers Toilet snails,Fry
17247,I was looking over there for a long time but I didnt see any Oh there they are Gross,Fry
17251,Those three exterminators are hilarious,Fry

17270,My antibackwards crystal So its you three I should have known Mom would send her brainless brood to do her dirty work Walt the leader among imbeciles,Farnsworth
17272,Larry the snivelling middle child,Farnsworth
17274,"And you Igner The evil I could tolerate but the stupidity 
Igner",Farnsworth
17275,Good God Just knowing were in the same genus makes me embarrassed to call myself homo,Farnsworth
17277,There The repairs are complete,Fry
17278,Rake up some dark matter and top off the tank,Farnsworth
17279,Well there isnt any dark matter Nibbler hasnt pooped at all And he ate a whole family of koalas last night Nibbler Nibbler,Leela
17280,Im not interested in the whereabouts of your cutesyfruitsy space rat The only thing that matters right now is this crystal,Farnsworth
17282,"And be careful with that crystal 

Bender",Farnsworth

18746,Like The Pimpsons And Assarama,Bender
18747,Precisely  However the satellites collided shortly after launch and were never heard from again,Farnsworth
18749,Now Ive simulated that collision using Shrapnovision,Farnsworth
18750,Granted all that makes perfect sense but why is this death sphere destroying planets,Fry

20120,A mass extinction  That solar flare created a huge electromagnetic pulse that while harmless to organic life shortcircuited the robodinosaurs,Farnsworth
20122,Only puny mammallike robots cowering in caves could survive such a catastrophe,Farnsworth
20123,Guys guys I taught myself to knit,Bender
20124,Wait a moment If we could scavenge the right parts from these robodinos I might be able to construct a rudimentary spaceship to get us off this planet,Farnsworth
20125,Oh well it took almost two hours but its finished  Now lets go to sleep Its solar powered so we cant take off until sunrise,Farnsworth
20126,Well lets find something comfy to bed down on,Bender

20165,Shut up Im billing you by the hour Besides Im a robot theyll listen to me  Ladytrons and gentlebots,Bender
20168,Thank you Your Honor this meatman does not deny that we robots are the glorious products of evolution He claim only to have played a small role in supplying the initial machinery I ask you is that so crazy Yes its completely crazy and that is why you must find him not guilty by reason of insanity,Bender
20169,Objection Im not crazy I created you all and I came here in a homemade spaceship and lived in a cave If you dont believe me ask my uncle,Farnsworth
20173,Son you in a whole mess of trouble,Bender
20178,Im glad you agree Dr Banjo,Farnsworth
20180,Well I dont know about allknowing And I admit its possible however unlikely that some wise and allknowing alien monster set evolution in motion here on Earth,Farnsworth
20181,And the Creator could also be a robot,Bender
20182,Then who built this socalled Creatorrobot,Farnsworth
20184,I guess that would be stupid Never mind,Bender

20204,A claw man to slip past the metal detector and cut the alarm wires,Bender
20206,And finally a chump to be caught on video and later arrested,Bender

20222,Body switcher eh Mayhap the heist is back on Who needs accomplices if I can just use their bodies,Bender
20224,I failed to take into account the cerebral immune response,Farnsworth
20226,However perhaps they can Maybe we can swap back using a third body for temporary storage space,Farnsworth
20231,Now then Amy well simply switch bodies and then well well No Id be back in my body but then you and Bender would be switched And the Amy and Bender bodies cant trade minds again since they just did,Farnsworth

24741,No Thats the ship The boxy shape keeps it from going too fast And check out the interior Note the rearfacing safety seats,Leela
24742,Cool Hey wait If Im backwards I cant see out the windshield,Bender
24743,There is no windshield Who needs a big breakable piece of glass when we can just monitor everything on the padded dashboard display,Leela
24744,At least theres a cup holder,Bender
24746,Hey Well lets break this ship in,Fry
24748,All right Lets ride Safe and sound,Leela
24749,"Bender is bored Bender is bored

24752,Amazing You multicultural punks just race and tinker all day long,Farnsworth
24757,What Huh I guess were here Lets make the delivery,Leela
24760,The ship did everything But we didnt have an adventure,Fry
24761,This is a delivery company We need less adventures not more adventures Now come on lets go to the ready room and wait for our next assignment,Leela
24765,Oh right its Wednesday Today were gonna learn spinny kicks Yay,Fry
24767,I know how to stop at a stop sign,Leela
24768,Yo soccer mom speed it up Move that lunch bucket Oh Leela,Farnsworth
24769,Professor What did you do to the Planet Express ship And why are you wearing a leather lab coat,Leela
24771,I understand I can still outdrive your saggy ass even in this clunker,Leela
24778,Looks like youre about to lose to a minivan Unless you have any surprise moves youve forgotten about,Leela
24779,No no Wait Dimensional drift Now whos in the lead Seriously I have no idea,Farnsworth
24784,"Whats going on Why do I look like a stupid cartoon character I feel like I lost weight
 All of it",Fry
24785,Remarkable It seems that colliding at relativistic speed has collapsed us down into two dimensions,Farnsworth
24787,Call it what you will The point is the new Shrek movie wont look nearly as good,Farnsworth
24788,I was taking a nap in the back seatAnything happen while I was,Bender
24797,Hey Flatso how do we get out of this twobit dimension,Bender
24798,Theres a simple answer for that We cant But on the upside weve got a whole dimension to explore with entirely different laws of physicsWhy watch what happens when I drop this marble Well thats the same but other things are differentCome look at this twodimensional birds nest,Farnsworth
24799,Ooh me first Ill just step past Leela Ow Ow,Bender
24800,You cant step past in this dimension You have to step aroundObserve this twodimensional egg If we were in the third dimension looking down wed be able to see an unhatched chick in it just as a chick inside a threedimensional egg could be seen by an observer in the fourth dimension,Farnsworth
24801,Fourth dimension I cant picture that Youre dumb,Bender
24803,Who said that All I see are a bunch of vertical line segments,Fry
24805,WowHow did he even know were here,Fry
24807,Yum Apples Hey how come I cant swallow Hmm,Leela
24808,I guess its because our twoended digestive system cant exist in this dimension I suppose that could be an issue,Farnsworth
24809,I knew it I knew hed get us killed somehow,Leela
24810,As you can see or rather cant see but take my word for it such a digestive system would divide a 2D being into separate pieces So how are we supposed to eat and digest,Farnsworth
24812,Well since we have no digestive systems here I guess wed better get back to the third dimension after all,Farnsworth
24814,Theres nothing funny about science If there can be an Xaxis and a Yaxis why not a Zaxis,Farnsworth
24819,Safety killsWe got to move,Leela
24820,Lets go Lets go Lets go Oh whats the point of fleeing Even if we escape from those creatures well still be stuck in this dimension till we starve,Farnsworth
24821,Wait What about a dimensional drift If it went through the fourth dimension before maybe here itll go through the third dimension,Leela
24823,Two point one dimensions Two point two Two point pi,Farnsworth
24824,Look up there Theres some up The third dimension,Leela
24825,Indeed but were about to crash into some sort of huge disk,Farnsworth
