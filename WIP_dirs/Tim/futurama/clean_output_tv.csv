424,Leela,A week would be a little much
425,Fry,The moon was like this awesome romantic mysterious thing hanging up there in the sky where you could never reach it no matter how much you wanted to  But youre right Once youre actually here its just a big dull rock I guess I just wanted you to see it through my eyes the way I used to

735,Leela,Animals
736,Farnsworth,Thats right Animals in desperate need of rescue You see Vergon 6 was once filled with a superdense substance known as dark matter each pound of which weighs over ten thousand  pounds
737,Leela,Wait What about the animals
738,Farnsworth,Well dark matter is extremely valuable as starship fuel Thats why it was all mined out leaving the planet completely hollow
739,Leela,Yes but what about the animals
740,Farnsworth,The wha
741,Leela,The animals
742,Farnsworth,I didnt say anything about animals Now it seems that the planet will collapse within three days Incidentally this will kill all the animals
743,Leela,So we have to bring back two of each kind Just like Noahs Ark
744,Bender,Why two  Oh
745,Fry,I bet you Leelas holding out for a nice guy with one eye
746,Bender,Thatll take forever What she oughta do is find a nice guy with two eyes then poke one out
747,Fry,Yeah thatd be a timesaver
748,Leela,Do you mind
749,Bender,Here you go  You can use this as an eyepoker
750,Leela,Thank you But I dont care how many eyes a man has  as long as its less than five All Im looking for is a guy whos adventurous selfconfident
751,Leela,maybe a snappy dresser
752,Zapp,These new uniforms are pretty snappy eh first officer
753,Kif,I suppose Captain Im not as big a fan of velour as you are Now what do you want to do about that unidentified ship
754,Zapp,Destroy them  Mmm Thats got a nice feel to it
755,Zapp,Captains journal
756,Kif,Who are you talking to sir
757,Zapp,You Arent you getting this  We have detected a vessel attempting to break the security cordon around Vergon 6 Im anticipating an allout tactical dogfight followed by a light dinner  ravioli ham sundae bar
758,Leela,Hey look Thats Zapp Brannigans ship
759,Fry,Wow The Zapp Brannigan
760,Leela,Uhhuh
761,Fry,Whos the Zapp Brannigan

763,Zapp,Not yet Kif In the game of chess you can never let your adversary see your pieces  What
764,Leela,They say Zapp Brannigan singlehandedly saved the Octillian System from a horde of rampaging Killbots
765,Fry,Wow
766,Bender,A grim day for robotkind Ah but we can always build more Killbots
767,Leela,Hes the most decorated captain in the whole Democratic Order of Planets
768,Fry,Leelas got a boyfriend
769,Leela,No I dont But I think we ought to meet with him and see if hell help us rescue those animals
770,Bender,Well just in case you guys hit it off youll wanna take this with you
771,Kif,Sir theyre headed straight for us
772,Zapp,A wellcalculated move straight out of Sun Tzus classic text The Art Of War or my own masterwork
773,Kif,Sir theyve docked with us and have come aboard
774,Zapp,Then I have risked all and lost Kif old man Ill be in the escape pod  If that wicker chair I like survives the slaughter have it sent to my PO box
775,Leela,Hello Im Leela captain of the Planet Express delivery ship Weve come aboard to plead for your assistance
776,Kif,Well if theres anything
777,Zapp,Im in command here Zapp Brannigan Has my fame preceded me or was I too quick for you
778,Leela,Oh not at all Im just so uh really thrilled to meet you
779,Zapp,Youre an impressive piece of captain Beautiful and deadly  a potent combination
780,Leela,You dont mean that
781,Zapp,But I do I doubt Ive seen more than three or four captains sexier than you and only one who was deadlier
782,Fry,I heard that one time you singlehandedly defeated a horde of rampaging somethings in the somethingsomethingsystem
783,Zapp,The Killbots A trifle It was simply a matter of outsmarting them
784,Fry,Wow I never would have thought of that
785,Zapp,You see Killbots have a preset kill limit Knowing their weakness I sent wave after wave of my own men at them until they reached their limit and shutdown Kif show them the medal I won
786,Zapp,More please  A little more  more  keep going
787,Leela,Captain Brannigan we really need to talk to you about our mission
788,Zapp,Whatever it is Im willing to put wave after wave of men at your disposal Right men
789,Crewman,You suck
790,Leela,Were hoping to save the animals of Vergon 6 from extinction And if you could just
791,Zapp,Vergon 6 This light dinner is over
792,Leela,Wait Whats wrong
793,Zapp,The Democratic Order of Planets prohibits interfering with undeveloped worlds Its a little rule known as Brannigans Law
794,Leela,But people already interfered That planet was mined completely hollow
795,Zapp,Yes by a Democratic Order of Planets mining crew
796,Leela,This doesnt make any sense
797,Zapp,I dont pretend to understand Brannigans Law I merely enforce it
798,Leela,Fine Well save the animals without your help
799,Zapp,Im afraid I cant allow that Guards
800,Fry,What just happened
801,Bender,Hes throwing us in prison
802,Fry,Dang Can I get this wrapped up
803,Leela,Ow I mightve liked Zapp Brannigan if he werent a pompous dimwit who threw me in prison
804,Bender,You really are too picky
805,Zapp,Kif follow me up to the observation deck Ive got some musing to do
806,Kif,Oh jeez
807,Zapp,Im facing a formidable female adversary Kif Suggestions
808,Kif,I fail to see any problem sir You already imprisoned her under directive B1081
809,Zapp,You mean Brannigans Law
810,Kif,Right that law
811,Zapp,Which one
812,Kif,Brannigans Law
813,Zapp,Kif youre my best and most loyal friend but youve earned my contempt once again As my protégé you should know that the only way to deal with a female adversary is to seduce her  This time we are sure shes a woman right
814,Kif,Yes
815,Zapp,Good Invite her to my quarters Oh and have the boy lay out my formal shorts
816,Kif,The boy sir

921,Zapp,Certainly But first youll have to get rid of that thing  Thats the law Leela And Brannigans Law is like Brannigans love
922,Zapp,Now put that greasy rat outside and well tow you to safety
923,Leela,I would never abandon a helpless animal Yknow Zapp once I thought you were a big pompous buffoon Then I realised that inside you were just a pitiful child But now I realise that outside that child is a big pompous buffoon
924,Zapp,And which one rocked your world
925,Fry,Wow Way to tell that guy off Now whats your secret escape plan
926,Leela,Uh I guess to sit here and wait for death
927,Bender,Can do
928,Bender,What the hell was that
929,Fry,Pew
930,Leela,I dont believe it Its dark matter
931,Bender,So this guy just unloaded a steaming pile of starship fuel
932,Leela,His species mustve filled the entire planet with it Did you do that you cute little  Come on That should be more than enough fuel to get us outta here Bender pick it up and put it in the engine
933,Leela,We made it  And some of the animals survived
934,Bender,So a couple of animals didnt die and Leela got lucky Thats what I call a successful mission
935,Fry,Were heroes
936,Leela,Dear Captains Diary
937,Zapp,Captains journal
938,Kif,April 13th
939,Zapp,April 13th  point two
940,Zapp,We have failed to uphold Brannigans Law However I did make it with a hot alien babe And in the end is that not what man has dreamt of since first he looked up at the stars Kif Im asking you a question
941,Leela,What do you think of the view Fry
942,Fry,It really puts things in perspective I mean from up here an entire world can seem utterly insignificant
943,Bender,Hey nice seats Were close enough so when you knock a player down with a beer bottle he stays down
944,Fry,I dont get it Is blernsball exactly the same as baseball
945,Farnsworth,Baseball God forbid
946,Leela,Face it Fry Baseball was as boring as mum and apple pie Thats why they jazzed it up
947,Fry,Boring Baseball wasnt  hmm so they finally jazzed it up
948,Fry,Home run Woooo Right
949,Umpire,Out
950,Fry,What just happened Why is the ball on that springy thing
951,Leela,Its traditional Just like aluminium bats and the seventh inning grope
952,Bender,I got me a souvenir  Aww here you go kid
953,Zoidberg,Id like a jumbo squidlog please
954,Man,We dont sell those
955,Zoidberg,Alright alright Let me have one of your young on a roll
956,Man,Were out of rolls
957,Zoidberg,Fine Just give me something crawling with parasites
958,Fry,Mmmm at least hot dogs havent changed
959,Bender,Hey buddies who wants popcorn
960,All,Ill have some me yeah
961,Bender,Anyone want butter on that
962,Fry,Hey Im starting to get the hang of this game The blerns are loaded the counts three blerns and two antiblerns and the infield blern rule is in effect right
963,Leela,Except for the word blern that was complete gibberish The blernsball falls into a hole and indescribable mayhem ensues Fry scratches his head in confusion Leela writes on her score card All right Yes
964,Fry,What just happened
965,Leela,Millers on a pace to hit 70 blerns
966,Farnsworth,Hes good all right But hes no Clem Johnson And Johnson played back in the days when steroid injections were mandatory
967,Bender,Clem Johnson That skin bag wouldnt have lasted one pitch in the old Robot Leagues Now Wireless Joe Jackson there was a blern hitting machine
968,Leela,Exactly He was a machine designed to hit blerns I mean come on Wireless Joe was nothing but a programmable bat on wheels
969,Bender,Oh and I suppose pitching at 5000 was just a modified howitzer
970,Leela,Yep
971,Bender,You humans are so scared of a little robot competition you wont even let us on the field
972,Fry,What are you talking about Theres all kinds of robots down there
973,Bender,Yeah doing crap work Theyre bat boys ball polishers sprinkler systems But how many robot managers are there
974,Fry,Eleven
975,Bender,Zero  And what a surprise Look whos scraping up the filth Is it a human child I wish
976,Farnsworth,Oh dear Lord
977,Fry,Whats wrong
978,Farnsworth,Itsmynewpager
979,Hermes,Get away you filthy bird Shoo Professor turn me off quick
980,Farnsworth,Im sorry what
981,Hermes,See you at the office
982,Bender,Admit it You all think robots are machines built by humans to make their lives easier
983,Fry,Well arent they
984,Bender,Ive never made anyones life easier and you know it
985,Farnsworth,Great news everyone Youll be delivering a package to Chapek 9 A world where humans are killed on sight
986,Fry,Why is that great news
987,Farnsworth,Im glad you asked that question Fry You see Chapek 9 was colonised centuries ago by a murderous crew of radical robot separatists
988,Bender,Oh so just cause a robot wants to kill humans that makes him a radical
989,Leela,Hey hold on I understand these robots hate humans but how do they feel about humanoid aliens
990,Farnsworth,Theyre not fans
991,Hermes,Thats why Bender will have to make the actual delivery
992,Bender,Oh I get it make the robot do all the work
993,Leela,This is the first actual work youve ever had to do around here
994,Bender,Well Im not doing it Its a robot holiday
995,Fry,Really Which one
996,Bender,Only Robanukah The holiest two weeks on the robot calendar
997,Leela,Oh come on Bender Last month it was Robomadan and before that Robonzaa
998,Fry,Man that one was a blast
999,Bender,It wasnt just a blast it was a sacred tribute to my ancestral prototypes which happened to take the form of a drinking contest
1000,Hermes,Now look here Bender I respect your diversity to the extent the law requires but you used up all your days off when you had that bout of Roberculosis
1001,Bender,All right Ill go But so help me Ill hold a grudge against every last one of you for the rest of your lives
1002,Farnsworth,Well then its settled So long everyone
1003,Fry,So let me get this straight
1004,Bender,No Its inhabited by robots
1005,Fry,Oh Kinda like how a warehouse is inhabited by boxes
1006,Leela,OK Bender were here Its time to get to work
1007,Bender,Yes Miss Leela tote that space barge lift that space bale
1008,Leela,Now we cant land on the surface because those robots will kill Fry and me so well have to stay up here and lower you with the winch And remember
1009,Bender,Ill try to keep that in mind
1010,Leela,Hmm he seems pretty angry
1011,Fry,Yeah but I guess Id be angry too if I had to go to some uninhabited planet
1012,Leela,Maybe we ought to do something nice for him
1013,Leela,There That ought to show that stupid robot we care about him
1014,Fry,Ah Bender must be done with the delivery

1017,Leela,No we cant Theyll kill us on sight
1018,Fry,Well what are we going to do
1019,Leela,I dont know I dont know Its not an easy decision If only I had two or three minutes to think about it
1020,Leela,OK If were going to save Bender weve got to look and act exactly like robots
1021,Fry,nan
1022,Leela,We have to walk like robots talk like robots and if necessary solve complex differential equations like robots
1023,Fry,I can sort of dance like a robot Will that help
1024,Leela,Fry first of all this is serious And second of all
1025,Fry,Man we look stupid We shouldve gotten store bought costumes

1162,Bender,The fact is humans are completely harmless
1163,Blue Elder,Were well aware of that
1164,Bender,You are
1165,Blue Elder,Of course But theyre useful to us as a scapegoat to distract the public from their real problem
1166,Green Elder,Like our crippling lugnut shortage
1167,Orange Elder,And a corrupt government of incompetent Robot Elders
1168,Lime Elder,Duh thats for sure
1169,Blue Elder,Quiet Jimmy

1509,Fry,Stupid slug Ive never been so thirsty  Ah
1510,Fry,Hello Anybody home
1511,Guard #1,The royal bottle is empty
1512,Guard #2,You drank our Emperor
1513,Fry,No It wasnt me
1514,Guard #1,You drank our Emperor You assassinated him
1515,Fry,I didnt mean to He just looked so cool and refreshing
1516,Guard #3,Im sure he was
1517,Guard #1,But now hes gone and your fate is sealed All hail the new Emperor
1518,Guards,Hail Hail Hail
1519,Leela,So after I specifically asked you not to touch anything you drank a bottle of strange blue liquid It could have been poisonous acid
1520,Fry,It could have been But chances were equally good it was an Emperor
1521,Merg,Excuse me Your Majesty I am Merg the High Priest If I might interject
1522,Fry,You might
1523,Merg,I humbly advise that as your first act you choose a capable Prime Minister I suggest Gorgak the previous appointee
1524,Gorgak,I will be a forceful and effective administrator
1525,Bender,You know Fry Ive often thought about becoming a Prime Minister
1526,Fry,I gotta go with Bender
1527,Bender,Yes In your face Gorgak
1528,Leela,Thats it Fry As your captain I order you back to the ship You are in way over your head

1530,Bender,Stay the course pal
1531,Gorgak,Your Highness a package came for you
1532,Fry,Hey thanks  Wow This got here just in time
1533,Merg,This is Your Majestys harem You may choose any of these maidens to be your royal consort
1534,Fry,Um how about that one
1535,Merg,Oh I didnt realise Your Majesty was into that sort of thing
1536,Fry,On second thought Ill take that one
1537,Merg,Hey whatever you say Im not here to pass judgement
1538,Leela,Does anyone else think its odd that a shiftless 25yearold delivery boy could drop out of the sky kill the emperor and be rewarded instead of punished
1539,Fry,You dont have to beat around the bush Leela We all know who youre talking about  uh me right
1540,Amy,I dont think you have anything to worry about These people seem really mildmannered
1541,Zoidberg,They are mild In fact youre soaking in one right now
1542,Gorgak,You touched me in ways Ive never been touched before
1543,Merg,Ah there you are Your Majesty Its time to begin preparing for tomorrows coronation ceremony
1544,Zoidberg,A fancy dress gala Ill wear my formal shell
1545,Merg,Fry will be enthroned tomorrow at the setting of the three suns when we Trisolians enter our nocturnal phase
1546,Fry,There wont be a lot of longwinded speeches will there
1547,Merg,Only one The absolutely flawless recitation from memory of the royal oath By you
1548,Fry,Will there be cake
1549,Zoidberg,Yeah I know
1550,Amy,Hi
1551,Fry,There you go
1552,Gorgak,And now get ready to laugh till your sides leak with our planets foremost political satirist Florp
1553,Florp,So what is the deal with people from under the orange sun Theyre all  Right Am I right
1554,Fry,Oh yeah Yeah hes right
1555,Leela,Fry I have to talk to you Youre in terrible danger
1556,Leela,You see Emperor Plon here  He met his end when he was drunk by Emperor Strug And before he could even wipe his mouth Strug was drunk by Shwab
1557,Fry,So
1558,Leela,Look at all these guys Do you have any idea what the average length of their reigns was
1559,Fry,80000 years
1560,Leela,No One week
1561,Fry,Damn I knew you wouldnt have asked unless it was really high or really low
1562,Leela,Every Emperor ascended to power by assassinating the previous one And guess whos next
1563,Fry,Well at least my assassin will get whats coming to him
1564,Leela,Youre in tremendous danger you idiot Half of these Emperors were drunk at their own coronation
1565,Fry,Hey I plan on having a few brewskis myself
1566,Leela,No they were assassinated In fact the law says youll be killed on the spot if you fail to recite the oath from memory
1567,Fry,Yeah I was going to thumb through that later
1568,Leela,That is completely reckless Dont you ever think ahead
1569,Fry,Hell no If I stopped to think ahead I wouldnt be Emperor And I wouldnt even be here in the year 3000 Its just like the story of the grasshopper and the octopus All year long the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter while the octopus mooched off his girlfriend and watched TV But then the winter came and the grasshopper died and the octopus ate all his acorns and also he got a racecar Is any of this getting through to you
1570,Leela,I give up Youre gonna get yourself killed and this time I wont be here to save you
1571,Fry,Who asked you to I told you a hundred times to stop treating me like a baby Now go Go gather your nuts you nagging grasshopper
1572,Leela,Thats it Im never helping you again If anyone except you needs me Ill be in the ship
1573,Fry,Ill be fine Its not like anyones gonna drink me  Quit it
1574,Merg,People of Trisol it is my honour to present your new Emperor
1575,Fry,What up
1576,Merg,Stick to the oath
1577,Fry,Right I Fry who drank Bont the Viscous who drank Ungo the Moist who guzzled Zorn the Stagnant
1578,Fry,Who slurped Hudge the Dewy who enjoyed a soup composed principally of Throm the Chunky do solemnly swear to rule with honour and insanity Uh integrity
1579,Merg,Congratulations Your Highness  I now present you with your royal unisex robe Long live Fry the Solid
1580,Bender,Hey look The suns are setting I can finally switch to hard liquor
1581,Bender,Check out the glowing freaks Its beautiful Hey whats that
1582,Merg,The Emperor Bont Hes still alive
1583,Bont,Of course Im alive Now cut this creep open and drain me out
1584,Fry,My tummy hurts
1585,Bont,Theyre over here theyre running up the stairs
1586,Bender,Shut up you
1587,Fry,Ow
1588,Merg,Let us in
1589,Merg,Fry must die so that Bont may live
1590,Fry,What am I gonna do
1591,Amy,Weve gotta get the Emperor out of your body before they kill you
1592,Zoidberg,Relax Fry Ill simply spin you in a highspeed centrifuge separating out the denser fluid of His Highness
1593,Fry,But wont that crush my bones
1594,Zoidberg,Oh right right with the bones I always forget about the bones
1595,Bender,Hey why dont you just sweat him out
1596,Bont,Forget it As Emperor I refuse to be dripped out through somebodys armpit
1597,Fry,I could vomit or urinate Would you feel better about that
1598,Bont,Slightly But my favourite so far is the bonecrushing
1599,Amy,What about crying
1600,Fry,Thats a great idea Crying
1601,Bont,Fine That or the bone one
1602,Merg,Keep it up men The veneer is starting to peel
1603,Gorgak,Oh dear
1604,Fry,Its no use I wanna cry but Im just too macho
1605,Bender,Ill make you cry buddy  Youre a pimple on societys ass and youll never amount to anything
1606,Fry,What do you mean I was Emperor of a whole planet
1607,Bender,Good point But heres a disturbing reminder
1608,Fry,These things happen
1609,Bender,OK Fry grab a Kleenex for this one cause theres no God and your idiotic human ideals are laughable
1610,Fry,Phew Thats a load off my mind
1611,Bender,Man I guess its harder than I thought to make someone cry
1612,Amy,You did your best Bender
1613,Bender,Up yours bimbo
1614,Zoidberg,Lets face it were in hot butter here We should call Leela for help
1615,Bender,Cram it lobster  That is a good idea Ill go call her
1616,Fry,Shell never help me Shes still mad that I told her never to help me
1617,Amy,Cmon Leelas not the type to hold a grudge
1618,Operator,Collect call from
1619,Bender,Im not giving my name to a machine
1620,Leela,Ill accept
1621,Bender,Frys in trouble

1625,Leela,I dont know why I should I mean after what he
1626,Bender,Wait wait wait wait  What is it you like best about me
1627,Amy,Is she coming
1628,Bender,Im not sure But I do know that she likes my inyourface attitude
1629,Fry,What the hell is that
1630,Bont,Its the JuiceAMatic 4000 Itll strain my juices from you while filtering out the pulp By which I mean your shredded remains
1631,Zoidberg,Of course Why didnt I think of that
1632,Fry,This is the saddest day of my life And I still cant cry
1633,Bender,Wait a second Here comes Leela
1634,Amy,Oh no They have her totally outnumbered
1635,Fry,I cant believe it Shes risking her life for me after the way I treated her I dont deserve this I feel terrible
1636,Bender,You do Hmm
1637,Fry,Is she alright
1638,Bender,I dont know Perhaps Ill look out this window Oh dear God in heaven theyre swarming all over her
1639,Fry,No No
1640,Amy,What are you talking about Bender Shes al   Oh
1641,Bender,Theyre strapping her to juicer Oh theyre putting some ice cubes in the glass under it
1642,Fry,This cant be happening
1643,Bender,It can and for all you know it is  Im sorry Fry Shes dead
1644,Fry,All Leela ever wanted to do was help me But I was to proud too stupid to accept it  I wish I had died instead of her
1645,Leela,What are you talking about
1646,Fry,Leela Youre alive
1647,Leela,Of course Im alive
1648,Bender,I told Fry you were dead so he would cry out the Emperor but you had to go and wreck it by surviving
1649,Amy,We only got two drops
1650,Bont,Its only a matter of time now
1651,Zoidberg,Ill handle this
1652,Leela,Listen Fry I think I can get us out of this if youre willing to let me help you
1653,Fry,Thanks Leela From now on Ill take all the help youre willing to give I know you just want whats best for me  That hurt

1668,Fry,Wow I love symposia
1669,Farnsworth,Its the event of the scientific season Every member presents an invention and the best one wins the Academy prize
1670,Bender,Sounds boring
1671,Farnsworth,Oh my yes But not this year because my latest invention is unbeatable Behold The death clock  Simply jam your finger in the hole and this readout tells you exactly how long you have left to live
1672,Leela,Does it really work
1673,Farnsworth,Well its occasionally off by a few seconds What with free will and all
1674,Fry,Sounds like fun How long do I have left to live
1675,Bender,Ooh Dibs on his CD player
1676,Farnsworth,Oh my yes
1677,Fry,Whos the gross nerd
1678,Farnsworth,Thats me at the very first symposium Im the Academys oldest living member you know These youngsters all look up to me
1679,Wernstrom,Well well well Look who decided to show his wrinkled face
1680,Farnsworth,Why dont you just leave me alone Wernstrom
1681,Wernstrom,Face it Farnsworth youre over the hill Its time to leave science to the 120yearolds
1682,Farnsworth,You young turks think you know everything I was inventing things when you were barely turning senile
1683,Wernstrom,Go home before you embarrass yourself old man Now if youll excuse me Im going to take a nap before the ceremonies
1684,Fry,Whos that jerk
1685,Farnsworth,A hundred years ago he was my most promising student at Mars University But then after one fateful popquiz
1686,Wernstrom,Aminus No one gives Ogden Wernstrom an Aminus
1687,Farnsworth,Im sorry but penmanship counts
1688,Wernstrom,I swear Ill have my revenge even if it takes me a hundred years
1689,Farnsworth,And here it is
1690,Bender,Ive been perusing your fortified wine list and Ive selected the 71 Hobos Delight the 57 Chateau Parté and the 66 Thunder Chevitz
1691,Waiter,Exquisite choices sir
1692,Bender,And mix them all together in a big jug
1693,Popeil,Welcome to this years Academy of Inventors Annual Symposium Im your host Ron Popeil inventor of Mr Microphone the sprayon toupee and of course the technology to keep human heads alive in jars  But wait theres more Weve got a whole lineup of inventors tonight starting with that up and coming young star Ogden Wernstrom
1694,Bender,More wine
1695,Wernstrom,Distinguished members of the Academy I present to you the Reverse Scuba Suit Observe  Bad fish
1696,Fry,Dont worry Professor its no competition for your death clock
1697,Wernstrom,And what will you be presenting this evening grandpa
1698,Farnsworth,Lets just say itll put you young whippersnappers in your place
1699,Wernstrom,I just hope its not as lame as that death clock you presented last year
1700,Farnsworth,Uh last year you say
1701,Wernstrom,Thats right
1702,Farnsworth,Oh my Did it put you young whippersnappers in your place
1703,Wernstrom,Hardly We laughed until our teeth fell out Come along Cinnamon
1704,Farnsworth,Oh dear Ill have to invent something new in the next ten minutes Perhaps some sort of death clock
1705,Leela,Uh Professor
1706,Popeil,Our last presentation comes from our oldest member Professor Hubert Farnsworth Professor
1707,Farnsworth,Just a second just a second
1708,Wernstrom,Pencils down pruneface
1709,Farnsworth,Uh yes here I am OK now hello there Now we all know telescopes allow us to see distant objects But what if we want to smell distant objects Well now we can Thanks to my new invention  the Smellescope
1710,Man,Oh I say
1711,Farnsworth,The odour travels past this coffee stain here around the olive pit and into this cigar burn And this appears to be a doodle of myself as a cowboy  Oh my
1712,Wernstrom,Ive waited a hundred years for this Farnsworth I give your invention the worst grade imaginable
1713,Popeil,And now for the presentation of the award Listen folks Im practically giving this prize away to Dr Wernstrom for his fish thingy
1714,Farnsworth,Perhaps 149 is just too old to be a scientist
1715,Bender,Yep
1716,Fry,No Professor dont give up There were plenty of times in my century when I was gonna give up but I never did Never Hey are you even listening to me Oh I give up
1717,Farnsworth,By God youre right Im going to build that Smellescope
1718,Farnsworth,Eureka
1719,Fry,Did you build the Smellescope
1720,Farnsworth,No I remembered that Id built one last year Go ahead try it Youll find that every heavenly body has its own particular scent Here Ill point it at Jupiter
1721,Fry,Smells like strawberries
1722,Farnsworth,Exactly And now Saturn
1723,Fry,Pine needles Oh man this is great Hey as long as you dont make me smell Uranus
1724,Leela,I dont get it
1725,Farnsworth,Im sorry Fry but astronomers renamed Uranus in 2620 to end that stupid joke once and for all
1726,Fry,Oh Whats it called now
1727,Farnsworth,Urectum Here let me locate it for you
1728,Fry,No no I think Ill just smell around a bit over here  Hmm
1729,Farnsworth,What is it  Oh jeez Oh man Remarkable A stench so foul its right off the FunkoMeter I dare say Fry may have discovered the smelliest object in the known universe
1730,Bender,Ooh Ooh Name it after me
1731,Leela,I think its moving
1732,Farnsworth,Hmm Perhaps the computer can calculate its trajectory  My God Whatever it is its headed straight for us With enough force to reduce this entire city to a stinky crater We have less than 72 hours
1733,Bender,Well lets get looting
1734,Fry,So this things gonna destroy the whole city  What the heck is it
1735,Farnsworth,Ah Just as I thought The answer lies in this movie I found on the Internet
1736,Narrator,The repulsive barge circled the oceans for 50 years but no country would accept it not even that really filthy one You know the one I mean Finally in 2052 the city used its mob connections to obtain a rocket and launch the garbage into outer space Some experts claim the ball might return to Earth someday but their concerns were dismissed as depressing
1737,Fry,Wow You got that off the Internet  In my day the Internet was only used to download pornography
1738,Farnsworth,Actually thats still true
1739,Female Scientist,Now that the garbage is in space doctor perhaps you can help me with my sexual inhibitions
1740,Male Scientist,With gusto
1741,Farnsworth,So thats the situation Due to the shortsightedness of Old New York New New York is going to be destroyed by a giant ball of garbage
1742,Leela,Fry what the hell were you people thinking back then How could you just throw your garbage away
1743,Fry,Hey gimmie a break What do you do with it
1744,Leela,We recycle everything Robots are made from old beer cans
1745,Bender,Yeah And this beer can is made outta old robots
1746,Leela,And that sandwich youre eating is made of old discarded sandwiches  Nothing just gets thrown away
1747,Fry,The future is disgusting
1748,Leela,Typical 20th century attitude
1749,Fry,Hey You have no right to criticise the 20th century We gave the world the lightbulb the steamboat and the cotton gin
1750,Leela,Those things are all from the 19th century
1751,Fry,Yeah well they probably just copied us
1752,Farnsworth,Please Theres no time for this now This is an emergency We must warn the mayor
1753,Poopenmeyer,Garbage ball huh That sounds serious
1754,Farnsworth,Very serious Mayor Poopenmeyer
1755,Poopenmeyer,I gotta be sure this isnt another scientific fraud like global warming or secondhand smoke  Send in my science advisor
1756,Farnsworth,Wernstrom
1757,Wernstrom,Well well well Come to present your latest napkin Professor
1758,Farnsworth,No Im here because a giant trash ball is heading straight for us Smell for yourself
1759,Poopenmeyer,Hey Holy jeez
1760,Wernstrom,That smell could be anything a faulty stench coil some cheese on the lens who knows
1761,Woman,Mr Mayor we just got this transmission from Neptune
1762,Man, passed close by  horrible stench
1763,Woman,The transmission cuts out there sir  No I guess it keeps going
1764,Woman,There we go
1765,Poopenmeyer,My God The senile old man is right
1766,Wernstrom,Do you mean him or me
1767,Poopenmeyer,Him
1768,Linda,Next New New York in crisis Morbo
1769,Morbo,Thanks human female Puny Earthlings were shocked today to learn that a ball of garbage will destroy their pathetic city of New New York
1770,Linda,Makes me glad we live here in Los Angeles
1771,Morbo,Morbo agrees
1772,Leela,Cant we just shoot a missile at it
1773,Military Man,Weve simulated that on a supercomputer but the ball is just too damn gooey A missile would go right through it
1774,Farnsworth,But suppose we send a crew to plant an explosive precisely on the fault line between this mass of coffee grounds and this deposit of America Online floppy disks
1775,Military Man,In theory it could work
1776,Wernstrom,Uh in theory perhaps But youll never find a crew willing to take on a mission so suicidally dangerous
1777,Bender,Oh crap
1778,Farnsworth,Now youll only have one chance to destroy the ball After that it will be so close to Earth that blowing it up would cause garbage to rain over the entire planet killing billions
1779,Bender,Oh boohoo
1780,Farnsworth,Now heres the bomb Ive prepared Once you activate it youll have 25 minutes to get away
1781,Leela,Thats all But
1782,Farnsworth,Now now therell be plenty of time to discuss your objections when and if you return
1783,Leela,Odour at magnitude 8  Were breaking up Turn on the antismell device
1784,Fry,Hmm sporty
1785,Fry,Wow
1786,Leela,Look at all this filth
1787,Fry,Its not filth Its a glorious monument to the achievements of the 20th century  Some Bart Simpson dolls
1788,Doll,Eat my shorts
1789,Bender,OK  Mmm Shorts
1790,Leela,Fry this stuff was garbage when it was new Lets blow it up already
1791,Fry,This junk isnt garbage I can dig in any random pile and find something great
1792,Fry,Alright lets get to work
1793,Leela,Lets see If thats Hypodermic Ridge then the bomb must go right here  6h minutes
1794,Bender,Theres your problem The Professor put the counter on upsidedown
1795,Leela,That idiot It wasnt set for 25 minutes it was set for 52 seconds
1796,Fry,Were gonna die  Right
1797,Bender,Right
1798,Bender,Its gonna blow
1799,Leela,Hey watch it Youll put somebodys eye out
1800,Bender,OK OK keep your space pants on Ill take care of this
1801,Fry,Were saved
1802,Leela,Yeah but this garbage balls unstoppable now New New York is done for
1803,Linda,All in all this is one day Mittens the kitten wont soon forget
1804,Morbo,Kittens give Morbo gas In lighter news the city of New New York is doomed Blame rests with known human Professor Hubert Farnsworth and his tiny inferior brain
1805,Farnsworth,Oh how could I have put that bomb timer on upsidedown I could swear I followed the manual precisely  Im a dried up husk of a scientist This is all my fault
1806,Fry,No its my fault too Im sure I threw out more than my share of that trash up there Also one month my toilet broke and it just went straight in the garbage can  Leela was right The people of the 20th century were idiotic slobs Especially me
1807,Poopenmeyer,Enough You all failed miserably Its time to put a real scientist in charge
1808,Farnsworth,Wernstrom
1809,Wernstrom,The very same
1810,Poopenmeyer,Dr Wernstrom can you save my city
1811,Wernstrom,Of course But itll cost you First Ill need tenure
1812,Poopenmeyer,Done
1813,Wernstrom,And a big research grant
1814,Poopenmeyer,You got it
1815,Wernstrom,Also access to a lab and five graduate students at least three of them Chinese
1816,Poopenmeyer,Um alright done Whats your plan
1817,Wernstrom,What plan Im set for life Au revoir suckers
1818,Leela,That rat Do something
1819,Poopenmeyer,I wish I could but hes got tenure
1820,Poopenmeyer,Its time to take action  Well Im out of ideas Anyone
1821,Farnsworth,Wait If we could build an object the exact size density and consistency of the garbage ball it might just knock the ball away without smashing it to bits
1822,Leela,But where can we find a substance the exact density and consistency as garbage
1823,Farnsworth,Alas I dont know
1824,Fry,Uh what about garbage
1825,Farnsworth,Good Lord A second ball of garbage That just might work
1826,Poopenmeyer,But garbage isnt something you just find lying in the streets of Manhattan This citys been garbagefree for 500 years
1827,Fry,Then its time to make some more
1828,Poopenmeyer,Make garbage But how
1829,Fry,Stand back and watch the master This Slurm can  Pure garbage Now you try it
1830,Poopenmeyer,By God I think the boys got something Come on everyone The fate of the city is at stake
1831,Fry,Good  Very nice
1832,Poopenmeyer,Get that robot some more beer  Weve trashed this room but thats just the start Weve got to get Frys message to the people
1833,Fry,People of New New York take a lesson from the 20th century Stop all this painintheass recycling and throw your garbage on the floor
1834,Fry,Go ahead Just chuck it any old place like I used to Your city is counting on you
1835,Farnsworth,If my calculations are correct this garbage ball will knock the other garbage ball directly into the sun
1836,Wernstrom,And if my calculations are correct were all going to die horribly
1837,Poopenmeyer,Alright places everyone Prepare for launch
1838,Farnsworth,Five four three two three four five six
1839,Leela,Just fire the damn thing
1840,Fry,Oops
1841,Farnsworth,Burning garbage
1842,Fry,It worked
1843,Poopenmeyer,And so on behalf of the entire city I thank you Professor Farnsworth I now present you with the Academy prize which we confiscated from Dr Wernstrom after it became apparent that he was a jackass
1844,Farnsworth,Yes In your face Wernstrom
1845,Wernstrom,Ill get you Farnsworth Even if it takes me another hundred years
1846,Poopenmeyer,And Fry we owe you a tremendous debt as well If not for your 20th century garbagemaking skills wed all be buried under 20th century garbage
1847,Leela,Should we really be celebrating I mean what if the second garbage ball returns to Earth like the first one did
1848,Fry,Who cares That wont be for hundreds of years
1849,Farnsworth,Exactly Its none of our concern
1850,Fry,Thats the 20th century spirit
1851,Fry,This is awesome Ive been waiting a thousand years to see a Beastie Boys show
1852,Bender,Can I get anybody a beer
1853,Fry,Sure
1854,Announcer,Ladies and gentlemen here to lay down some old old incredibly old school beats

1856,Leela,Impressive Theyre busting mad rhymes with an 80 success rate

1892,Preacherbot,Wretched sinner unit The path to robot heaven lies here    in The Good Book 30
1893,Bender,Hey Do I preach to you when youre lying stoned in the gutter No So beat it
1894,Fry,Who was that guy
1895,Bender,Your mama Now shut up and drag me to work
1896,Hermes,Our electric bills climbing faster than a green snake up a sugar cane Obviously someone round been wastin a whole heap a juice Probably you
1897,Zoidberg,Me
1898,Amy,Good morning Bender
1899,Bender,None of your business Get off my back
1900,Amy,Whats his problem
1901,Leela,If I didnt know better Id almost think he was abusing electricity
1902,Fry,Bender No way  I definitely wouldve noticed something
1903,Leela,Bender why are you spending so much time in the bathroom Are you jacking on in there
1904,Bender,No Dont come in
1905,Farnsworth,Good news everyone Today youll be delivering a crate of subpoenas to Sicily 8 the Mob Planet
1906,Bender,Alright lets get to work Ill be out in a second
1907,Fry,I know Big Vinnie said he was giving me the kiss of death but I still think he was gay
1908,Leela,Did he use his tongue
1909,Fry,A little  You OK Bender
1910,Bender,None of your business Get off my back
1911,Leela,Uhoh There seems to be some sort of electrical disturbance in the Coalsack Nebula
1912,Bender,A what kind of disturbance
1913,Leela,Electrical Anyway its going to take some careful piloting to avoid it
1914,Leela,Were out of control Were heading straight into the electric field
1915,Fry,Whats happening II feel weird
1916,Bender,Come on universe you big mostly empty wuss Gimmie all the juice you got  Oh mama
1917,Bender,What
1918,Leela,Bender we didnt mind your drinking or your kleptomania or your pornography ring
1919,Zoidberg,In fact thats why we loved you
1920,Leela,But this electricity abuse crossed the line You almost killed us
1921,Fry,And you made me feel like a jerk for trusting you Just like when my friend Richie swore he wasnt taking drugs and then he sold me my moms VCR and then later I found out he was taking drugs You make me ashamed to be your friend
1922,Bender,Youre right Im a lost cause
1923,Bender,Maybe theres another way
1924,Bender,Oh yeah thats the good stuff  What am I doing What have I become Huh
1925,Preacherbot,I see a lot of fancy robots here today made of real shiny metal But that dont impress the Robot Devil no sir
1926,Vergerbot,No sir
1927,Preacherbot,Cause if youre a sinner hes gonna plug his infernal modem in the wall belchin smoke and flame And hes gonna download you straight to Robot Hell
1928,Vergerbot,Straight to hell
1929,Preacherbot,So I ask you
1930,Bender,Me
1931,Hermes,And as a further costcutting measure I have eliminated the saltwater cooler
1932,Zoidberg,This is a witch hunt
1933,Bender,"Oh what a beautiful morning
Oh what a beautiful day
 Greetings friends Dont we all look nice today"
1934,Fry,Great Hes whacked out on electricity again
1935,Bender,No Im whacked out on life My friends I found religion
1936,Fry,Religion Is this another scam to get free yarmulkes
1937,Leela,Give him a break Fry If this helps Bender clean up his act then I think we should be supportive
1938,Farnsworth,Yes
1939,Amy,Oh yeah
1940,Hermes,Oh yes
1941,Zoidberg,Oh yeah
1942,Bender,Wonderful Then youll all come to my exceedingly long unairconditioned baptism ceremony
1943,Preacherbot,We are gathered here today to deliver brother Bender from the cold steel grip of the Robot Devil unto the cold steel bosom of our congregation

2396,Fry,Sorry I overslept
2397,Farnsworth,Until 5pm
2398,Fry,Its that obnoxious monkey He kept me up all night with his constant thinking Just thinking and thinking Hes trying to make me look like an idiot
2399,Farnsworth,Dont be jealous Without his special hat Guenter might be no more intelligent than you
2400,Fry,I hate that rodent
2401,Farnsworth,Fry that monkey is my most important experiment If you two dont stop fighting Ill have you both neutered
2402,Fry,Thatll show him

2416,Bender,Well looks like the partys winding down Lets take a road trip to Tijuana and get Fatbot some action
2417,Fat-bot,Its my first time Im really nervous
2418,Vernon,Robot House
2419,Leela,What you did to Guenter was cruel At the risk of sounding like an afterschool special I think we learned who the real animal was today
2420,Fry,You mean peer pressure
2421,Fry,Look out Hes got a gun
2422,Guenter,Leave me alone
2423,Leela,Hey whats going on I thought you didnt like bananas
2424,Guenter,Of course I do I try so hard to fit in but seeing my parents act like that made me realise Im just a primitive beast
2425,Fry,Hey hey cheer up Not everyone turns out like their parents I mean look at me My folks were honest hardworking people
2426,Leela,Besides Guenter youre not like other monkeys Youve got the hat
2427,Guenter,So what I mean sure it looks cool and it makes me smart but it doesnt make me happy
2428,Leela,Thats so sad I didnt even know monkeys could cry
2429,Guenter,They cant Its all the hat
2430,Fry,Look Guenter if youre so miserable here maybe you should just go back to the jungle
2431,Guenter,The jungle But I couldnt do that to the Professor Im his prize experiment and hes like a father to me
2432,Leela,But hes not your father That guy in the punch bowl was your father
2433,Farnsworth,Look at him Im so proud
2434,Fry,Thanks Professor
2435,Farnsworth,Not you
2436,Fry,Ow
2437,Student,Hey
2438,Farnsworth,Oh I always feared he might run off like this Why Why Why didnt I break his legs
2439,Farnsworth,Oh poor Guenter
2440,Leela,So he just ran away in the middle of the exam
2441,Farnsworth,Im afraid so All he handed in was a paper smeared with faeces He tied with Fry
2442,Fry,I guess he realised I was right when I told him to go back to the jungle
2443,Farnsworth,You what After I spent months slaving over a hot monkey brain
2444,Fry,Hey dont blame me You tried to force Guenter to be a human but hes an animal He belongs in the wild Or in the circus on one of those tiny tricycles Now thats entertainment
2445,Farnsworth,But Guenters obviously better off being intelligent Tell him Leela
2446,Leela,Nuhuh Im staying out of this Now heres my opinion
2447,Farnsworth,What
2448,Leela,I said well go to the jungle and let Guenter decide once and for all
2449,Farnsworth,What
2450,Vernon,You all know the rules Whichever house wins the regatta becomes head of the Greek Council And should that house currently be on any type of multiple secret probation it will be lifted and I will be forced to serve as Grand Marshal of a parade honouring them
2451,Chet,I say Robot House your water craft is as illdesigned as you yourselves
2452,Meiderneyer,Good one Chet

2460,Farnsworth,Stand back
2461,Leela,Oops

2463,Fry,Theres our man

2465,Farnsworth,Come on Guenter take the hat
2466,Fry,No the banana the banana
2467,Farnsworth,Consider the philosophical and metaphysical ramifications of the
2468,Fry,Banana banana banana

2486,Farnsworth,Oh that poor sweet monkey Well lets go gather him up Theres no sense letting him go to waste
2487,Fry,Guenter Youre alive
2488,Guenter,I guess the hat must have broke my fall
2489,Farnsworth,It seems to be working at only halfcapacity but I can fix it
2490,Guenter,No wait I like it like this I actually feel sort of happy
2491,Farnsworth,But what about your superintelligence
2492,Guenter,When I had that there was too much pressure to use it All I want out of life is to be a monkey of moderate intelligence who wears a suit Thats why Ive decided to transfer to business school

3181,Leela,But theyre not even sharp Who could I possibly hurt with them
3182,Zapp,The Yarn People of Nylar 4  So a plan to assassinate a weirdlooking alien with scissors How very Neutral of you
3183,Leela,What

3186,Zapp,So beautiful yet so neutral  Drag them to the ship
3187,Glab,And now to cut the ribbon the legendary DOOP captain who just returned from a triumphant carpetbombing of Eden 7 Zapp Brannigan
3188,Zapp,What makes a man turn neutral Lust for gold Power Or were you just born with a heart full of neutrality

3205,Juror #1,You bet
3206,Glab,The jury is instructed to disregard its own testimony
3207,Hyper-Chicken,Your Honour the prosecution rests
3208,Glab,The evidence against Zapp Brannigan is strong However in light of his years of service and the incompetence of this hillbilly prosecutor Im afraid I must dismiss all charges
3209,Leela,Dismiss all charges Your Honour I know the case is closed and youve rendered your verdict but I wanna testify
3210,Glab,Im going to allow this
3211,Hyper-Chicken,Now Miss Leela on the date in question were you or were you not wearing a hoop skirt
3212,Leela,Thats a stupid question What matters is Zapp Brannigan is the sorriest captain Ive ever seen and I saw the idiot blow up DOOP headquarters with my own eye

3225,Zapp,Id like to make one final statement Kif cmere and hold up the flag  And wave it a little for Gods sakes My friends you can take away a mans title and his uniform but you can never take away his integrity or his honour Plus it was mostly Kifs fault
3226,Kif,What
3227,Glab,Kif Kroker you are also stripped of your rank and dishonourably discharged
3228,Zapp,One day a man has everything the next day he blows up a 400 billion space station and the next day he has nothing It makes you think

3241,Zapp,Just let me work for a little food Perhaps I could paint a fence or service you sexually or mop the floors
3242,Leela,You dont know how to do any of those things
3243,Zapp,Kif might
3244,Farnsworth,Leela who are you talking to

3248,Hermes,The green dude and the fat man
3249,Farnsworth,Hmm I could swear Ive never seen that robot before either

3251,Farnsworth,Oh yes yes My good friend of course  Anyway whoever you all are I have good news Youll be making a delivery to Stumbos 4 a planet with such high gravity youll most likely be crushed under the weight of your own hair Enjoy
3252,Zapp,So this Leela I know shes a very sensuous woman but what manner of captain is she
3253,Fry,Shes really strict
3254,Bender,And mean
3255,Zapp,I see Does she by any chance give the crewmembers spankings
3256,Fry,No she just makes us do work and stuff
3257,Zapp,Good good But should she ever institute some sort of barebottom spanking policy let me go in your place I wont have my comrades harmed
3258,Bender,Hey this guys alright
3259,Zapp,Heres to us poor schmoes working for the man Even if he is a hot sexy female man
3260,Kif,Ive computed out landing coordinates Captain
3261,Leela,Thanks Kif Very nice work
3262,Kif,Wait what
3263,Leela,I said very nice work
3264,Kif,This is the happiest day of my life
3265,Leela,OK crew listen up Your job is to delivery these 40 pillows to that hotel
3266,Bender,Theyre not very heavy but you dont hear me not complaining
3267,Leela,Theyre not heavy in here because we have an antigrav pump But once you get out on the surface the gravity will be very intense
3268,Fry,Hey no prob this lead apronll protect me
3269,Leela,I dont want any screwups Use the hoverdolly and just deliver one pillow at a time
3270,Bender,Hey heres an idea lets deliver all the pillows at once
3271,Fry,Yeah
3272,Zapp,Thats using the old noodle
3273,Zapp,Come on girdle Hold
3274,Bender,Uhoh
3275,Leela,What the hell happened
3276,Bender,Some breaking occurred the dolly was involved thats about all we know
3277,Leela,I told you dumb apes not to overload it Each of those pillows weighs 150lbs here
3278,Fry,Alright dont get your panties in a knot Well just use the backup dolly
3279,Bender,Ill start loading up the pillows
3280,Leela,No way Jack You disobeyed an order so now you have to deliver all 40 pillows by hand
3281,Zapp,Let me ask you a serious question Leela
3282,Leela,Just get to work
3283,Bender,Im Leela get to work neh neh neh
3284,Fry,I agree
3285,Kif,The point is its just so humiliating working for that man Once he actually ordered me to  shave his armpits while he was in the bathtub So I said
3286,Leela,Yknow why dont we talk about something besides Zapp for a while
3287,Kif,Oh alright Um  well  how bout then um OK well there he was in the tub alright
3288,Fry,Ah some good old highgravity rain Thatll cool us off
3289,Bender,This is all Leelas fault
3290,Fry,Yeah If she had let us use the backup dolly we could have broken it given up and gone home by now
3291,Zapp,Yknow boys a good captain needs many skills such as boldness daring and a velour uniform And Im not convinced Leela has any of those things
3292,Fry,Ah Leelas not that bad I just wish she didnt make us work so much
3293,Zapp,Back when I was captain all I asked from my men was their complete loyalty If I had that then for all I cared they could sit around the whole day drinking beer in their underpants
3294,Bender,Beer
3295,Fry,Underpants
3296,Kif,But now Zapps not captain anymore Im free  Oh you hear that Im actually laughing
3297,Fry,This is a mutiny
3298,Bender,Youre outta here lady Zapps the new captain
3299,Fry,All hail the new captain
3300,Zapp,Leela you might be a formidable doer of the nasty but I am forced to relieve you of your post
3301,Leela,On what grounds you slobbering oaf
3302,Zapp,Failure to prevent a mutiny Throw her in the brig
3303,Fry,We dont have a brig
3304,Zapp,Then throw her in the laundry room which will hereafter be referred to as the brig
3305,Leela,You really dont want me to be captain anymore
3306,Bender,You got it genius
3307,Leela,But didnt I do a good job
3308,Fry,You were mean and you yelled and you made us do all that work
3309,Leela,Sometimes a captain needs to do those things Besides I I thought we were friends
3310,Fry,Yeah well you shouldnt have been such a mean captain then
3311,Bender,Dont worry Leela Soon well be able to look back on this and laugh
3312,Zapp,Back in my old uniform and it nearly still fits Even after all that fattening hobo cuisine
3313,Kif,What shall I do with your civilian clothes sir
3314,Zapp,Take them to the laundrybrig  So do I have your loyalty men
3315,Bender,To the ends of the universe
3316,Fry,Ten hundred percent
3317,Zapp,Thats not nearly loyal enough I order you to sit around and drink beer until youre as loyal as Kif here
3318,Bender,Yes sir sir
3319,Kif,Um may I have a beer sir
3320,Zapp,No Youre loyal enough already Meanwhile I have a plan We will singlehandedly attack our archenemy the Neutral Planet
3321,Kif,Oh jeez
3322,Zapp,Once the neutral war machine lies in ruins Ill be a hero again and the DOOP will reinstate me as captain
3323,Kif,But sir that plan makes no sense
3324,Zapp,Maybe not to you Kif but if I recall correctly you were courtmartialled in disgrace
3325,Fry,Ooh burn
3326,Bender,Nailed you buddy
3327,Zapp,Prepare to continue the epic struggle between good and neutral
3328,Fry,This is awesome Were gonna be like powpowpow and theyre gonna be like    and then well have pancakes to celebrate and Ill be like
3329,Zapp,Precisely Now in the name of all that is good and honourable well call the Neutral President with a message of peace then blast him
3330,Bender,Yes sir sirdysirsirsir
3331,Zapp,Fly the white flag of war
3332,Zapp,This is Zapp Brannigan of the good ship  Planet Express Ship I come swinging the olive branch of peace
3333,Neutral President's Aide,Should we trust him Your Neutralness
3334,Neutral President,All I know is my gut says maybe
3335,Bender,What now chief
3336,Zapp,Now we crash the ship into their headquarters killing them in a hellish firestorm from which no living thing can escape
3337,Fry,Good good then what
3338,Zapp,Then your mission is complete I meanwhile will have ejected to safety wearing the only spacesuit on board
3339,Fry,Wait a second Is this plan gonna kill us
3340,Zapp,Of course What do you think I meant by loyalty Now help me into the only spacesuit It looks a bit sweaty in there so you may need to apply baby powder
3341,Fry,Leela we want you to be captain again
3342,Leela,Let me guess He cancelled naptime  So hes about to kill us
3343,Fry,We want Leela to be captain again
3344,Zapp,So its mutiny is it I never thought Id see the day Come Kif lets eject I found a childrens spacesuit you can wear
3345,Kif,To be honest sir Id rather stay here with Captain Leela She actually listens to what I have to
3346,Leela,Oh no Hes disabled the steering  Were gonna crash
3347,Bender,Leela save me  and yourself I guess  and my banjo  And Fry
3348,Leela,OK OK We have one chance Are you willing to do what I say as captain
3349,Fry,Absolutely
3350,Leela,Even if I make you work hard
3351,Bender,As your God is my witness
3352,Leela,Then go get the hoverdolly you didnt break and load all the dark matter into the left engine
3353,Bender,Oh man that craps heavy
3354,Fry,And warm
3355,Leela,Just do it
3356,Neutral President's Aide,Your Neutralness its a beige alert
3357,Neutral President,If I dont survive tell my wife Hello
3358,Leela,Hurry I dont wanna die at the age of 25
3359,Bender,Honey unless we hit a time warp I wouldnt worry about it
3360,Fry,Its too low
3361,Bender,Quick
3362,Leela,You did it You actually did it
3363,Fry,And no one will have to punish anyone for the mutiny
3364,Zapp,And so when Captain Leela panicked perhaps distracted by female troubles my quick thinking allowed me to do whatever I did to save the day
3365,Glab,Captain Leela is this rambling story of magic and heroism true
3366,Leela,Well actually
3367,Farnsworth,That a girl If they dont take him back we can keep him as captain
3368,Leela,Your Honour its all true
3369,Glab,In that case Zapp Brannigan I hereby restore your rank and parking privileges
3370,Farnsworth,Oh foo
3371,Zapp,Come Kif weve got work to do
3372,Kif,IIll call and tell you about it
3373,Fry,Leela I just want you to know that even though youre mean youre the best captain ever
3374,Bender,Yeah youre one dynamite lady Can we have a week off
3375,Leela,No
3376,Fry,Please
3377,Bender,Come on Captain
3378,Leela,Oh alright
3379,Farnsworth,No time off
3380,Fry,Aw man
3381,Leela,Lets mutiny
3382,Narrator,As per your request please find enclosed the last man on earth
3383,Man,Hey look at that weird mirror
3384,Bender,Cursed by his own hubris
3385,Leela,Theres a political debate on Quick change the channel
3386,Bender,Hey thats what Fry said when we turned on the debate
3387,Announcer,CSPAN9 presents
3388,Leela,Look I know there are no car chases but this is important One of these two men will become president of the world
3389,Fry,What do we care We live in the United States
3390,Leela,The United States is part of the world
3391,Fry,Wow I have been gone a long time
3392,Johnson,Its time someone had the courage to stand up and say
3393,Jackson,Now I respect my opponent I think hes a good man but quite frankly I agree with everything he just said
3394,Fry,These are the candidates They sound like clones  Wait a minute They are clones
3395,Leela,Dont let their identical DNA fool you They differ on some key issues
3396,Johnson,I say your three cent titanium tax goes too far
3397,Jackson,And I say your three cent titanium tax doesnt go too far enough
3398,Fry,If I were registered to vote Id send these clowns a message by staying home on election day and dressing up like a clown
3399,Leela,Youre not registered
3400,Fry,Nope Not vaccinated either Besides its not like one vote ever made a difference
3401,Leela,Thats not true the first robot president won by exactly one vote
3402,Bender,Ah yes John Quincy Adding Machine He struck a cord with the voters when he pledged not to go on a killing spree
3403,Farnsworth,But like most politicians he promised more than he could deliver
3404,Leela,The point is one vote can make a difference and even though it wont Im still taking you to get registered
3405,Farnsworth,Yes thats a capital idea Lets all go register
3406,Fry,Professor when did you become so obsessed with voting
3407,Farnsworth,The very instant I became old
3408,Farnsworth,The problem with both parties is that they always want to give your tax dollars to the less fortunate
3409,Fry,The less fortunate get all the breaks
3410,Zoidberg,You know Fry you could join a third party maybe
3411,Amy,Only weirdos and mutants join third parties
3412,Zoidberg,Really Id better keep an eye out at the next meeting
3413,Fry,What party do you belong to Bender
3414,Bender,Im not allowed to vote
3415,Fry,Cause youre a robot
3416,Bender,No convicted felon
3417,Woman,We favour unreasonably huge subsidies to the Brain Slug Planet
3418,Fry,OK but what are the Brain Slugs who control you gonna do for the working man
3419,Woman,Attach Brain Slugs to them
3420,Fry,Sure you say that now
3421,Amy,So is it true you can make all kinds of shirts and ropes out of hemp
3422,Stoned Guy,Daves not here man
3423,Amy,I also heard hemp makes great shampoo
3424,Stoned Guy,It does No way I gotta check out this brochure
3425,Farnsworth,So what are you doing to protect my constitutional right to bear doomsday devices
3426,N.R.A. Man,Well first off were gonna get rid of that threeday waiting period for mad scientists
3427,Farnsworth,Damn straight Today the mad scientist cant get a doomsday device tomorrow its the mad grad student Where will it end
3428,N.R.A. Man,Amen brother I dont go anywhere without my mutated anthrax    for duck hunting
3429,Zoidberg,Sure humans are cute but how else are we supposed to test cosmetics
3430,Hermes,I concur
3431,Fry,Now heres a party I can get excited about Sign me up
3432,V.A.P. Man,Sorry not with that attitude
3433,Fry,OK then screw it
3434,V.A.P. Man,Welcome aboard brother
3435,Fry,Alright
3436,V.A.P. Man,Youre out
3437,Fry,That was pretty cool I think Im actually starting to get interested in politics
3438,Linda,And so with two weeks left in the campaign the question on everyones mind is who will be the next President of Earth Jack Johnson or bitter rival John Jackson Two terrific candidates huh Morbo
3439,Morbo,All humans are vermin in the eyes of Morbo
3440,Linda,In other local news disaster struck on Saturns moon of Titan today when a titanium mine collapsed trapping 1000 robot workers
3441,Bender,What Lord have mercy
3442,Linda,Sir what rescue operations are planned
3443,Mine Spokesman,The plan is basically to pave over the area and get on with our lives
3444,Morbo,News of the mines closing sent titanium prices skyrocketing
3445,Bender,Alright Im rich

4723,Foreman,This could be the most onesided fight since 1973 when Ali faced an 80foot tall mechanical Joe Frazier MMy memorys not what it used to be but I think the entire Earth was destroyed
4724,Little,Interesting if true The Vegas odds tonight stand at an unprecedented 10000 a bet of 0 on Bender pays 1000 if he wins Still very few takers
4725,Foreman,Its notnot a smart bet
4726,Leela,According to the script youre supposed to prance out and tickle him with your fairy wand Instead I want you to prance out and kick his head off
4727,Bender,Got it Large kickle hold the tickle

5062,Farnsworth,Thats my prizewinning Smellescope If a dog craps anywhere in the universe you can bet I wont be out of the loop  And this is my universal translator Unfortunately so far it only translates into an incomprehensible dead language

5066,Cubert,Dont you have any worthwhile inventions
5067,Farnsworth,Why certainly Step over here

5069,Cubert,Thats impossible You cant go faster than the speed of light
5070,Farnsworth,Of course not Thats why scientists increased the speed of light in 2208
5071,Cubert,Also impossible
5072,Farnsworth,And what makes my engines truly remarkable is the afterburner which delivers 200 fuel efficiency
5073,Cubert,Thats especially impossible
5074,Farnsworth,Not at all Its very simple
5075,Cubert,Then explain it
5076,Farnsworth,Now thats impossible It came to me in a dream and I forgot it in another dream
5077,Cubert,Your explanations are pure weaponsgrade bolognium Its all impossible
5078,Farnsworth,Nothing is impossible Not if you can imagine it Thats what being is a scientist is all about

5087,Farnsworth,You  wha
5088,Cubert,I dont wanna be an inventor I wanna be something useful like a teachers aide or a prison guard or a sciencefiction cartoon writer
5089,Farnsworth,ButBut what about my hopes and my dreams and my wonderful inventions

Born to be all obsessive and snotty
I made my friends and relations file long applications
To get into my 10th birthday party"

5572,Colonel,Nice out of town folks Id like you to meet my daughter Umbriel Umbriel these are some Yankees
5573,Amy,So Fry Atlanta was an American city in your time
5574,Fry,I think it was just an airport They had a place where you could buy nuts
5575,Umbriel,No Ancient Atlanta was more than just a Delta hub It was a vibrant metropolis the equal of Paris or New York
5576,Fry,Thats right honey Whatever you say
5577,Umbriel,Look at these fabulous ruins Turner Field the CocaCola bottling plant the uh the airport
5578,Leela,But tell us how could a city with such a  fabulous airport end up underwater
5579,Colonel,Ah now thats a story that can only rightly be told in a Chamber of Commerce video narrated by folkrock troubadour Donovan
5580,Donovan,"Atlanta was a city landlocked
Hundreds of miles from the area we now call the Atlantic Ocean
Yet so desperate the citys desire for tourism
That they moved offshore becoming an island
And an even bigger Delta hub"
5581,Donovan,"until the city overdeveloped
And it started to sink
Knowing their fate the quality people ran away
Ted Turner Hank Aaron Jeff Foxworthy
The Guy Who Invented CocaCola the Magician
And the other socalled gods of our legends
Though gods they were
And also Jane Fonda was there"
5582,Donovan,"The others chose to remain behind
On their porches with their rifles
And one day evolve into mermaids
And sing and dance
And ring in the new"
5583,Mermaids,Hail Atlanta
5584,Leela,The magician
5585,Bender,Whoa whoa whoa Wouldnt it take millions of years to evolve into mermaids
5586,Umbriel,Normally yes but the caffeine really sped things up  That stuffs wonderful

6482,Scruffy,Scruffy knows who killed them people In Scruffys opinion it were

6503,Fry,Um I have a question What if Bender was really giant
6504,Leela,You idiot We already saw that
6505,Fry,I know I liked it I wanna see it again
6506,Farnsworth,Were not seeing it again Ask something less stupid
6507,Fry,Oh alright How bout this What if I never fell into that freezerdoodle and came to the futurejiggy
6508,Farnsworth,That question is less stupid though you asked it in a profoundly stupid way  What would happen if Fry never came to the future
6509,Fry,Hello Pizza delivery for  Icy Wiener Aw crud  I should have left you floating in the toilet
6510,Leela,What is it
6511,Farnsworth,It appears that the very fabric of spacetime has ripped
6512,Bender,Hey look An ugly scared guy Boo
6513,Fry,Who are you monsters Is one of you Icy Wiener
6514,Zoidberg,If thats his pizza then Im icy whatever
6515,Fry,You believe me about the monsters right Mr Panucci
6516,Panucci,Theres only three real monsters kid
6517,Stephen Hawking,No Today Id like something good
6518,Panucci,Hawking youre alright Ill make you the usual
6519,Fry,Hey Stephen Hawking Arent you that physicist that invented gravity
6520,Hawking,Sure Why not
6521,Fry,Let me ask you something
6522,Hawking,There is nothing to be concerned about I must go There is much to do
6523,Panucci,Hey Hawking Your pizzas ready
6524,Hawking,Toss it in the garbage
6525,Hawking,There he is Seize him
6526,Fry,Hey What the Ooh Ow Ow
6527,Fry,Who are you people
6528,Gore,Im Al Gore and these are my Vice Presidential Action Rangers a group of top nerds whose sole duty it is to prevent disruptions in the spacetime continuum
6529,Fry,I thought your duty was to cast the tiebreaking vote in the Senate
6530,Gore,That and protect the spacetime continuum Read the Constitution
6531,Fry,Hmm So I guess youll wanna see my Fry Hole
6532,Gore,Very much so But first meet the Action Rangers You already know Stephen Hawking Also with us are Nichelle Nichols aka Commander Uhura
6533,Nichols,Incoming transmission from MCI One Rate department It sounds like a limitedtime offer
6534,Gore,Tell them Im in the tub To my left youll recognise Gary Gygax inventor of Dungeons  Dragons
6535,Gygax,Greetings Its a    pleasure to meet you
6536,Gore,And our summer intern Deep Blue the worlds foremost chessplaying computer
6537,Deep Blue,Bishop to knight 4
6538,Gore,Not all missions can be solved with chess Deep Blue Someday youll understand that
6539,Fry,Where am I anyway
6540,Nichols,Youre travelling in a speciallyequipped terrestrial transport module
6541,Gygax,A school bus
6542,Fry,So what do you nerds want
6543,Nichols,Its about that rip in spacetime that you saw
6544,Hawking,I call it a Hawking Hole
6545,Fry,No fair I saw it first
6546,Hawking,Who is The Journal of Quantum Physics going to believe
6547,Gygax,Mr Fry the time disruption indicates that some of that was supposed to happen but didnt due to a quantum fluctuation
6548,Nichols,Thats why we had to beat you with tennis rackets
6549,Gore,If we dont go back there and make the event happen the entire universe will be destroyed And as an environmentalist Im against that
6550,Fry,So then my chair tilted back and I almost fell into this freezer thingy
6551,Hawking,I call it a Hawking Chamber
6552,Fry,But instead of falling in and getting frozen I missed and wanged my head
6553,Gore,Well its obvious what should have happened
6554,Fry,Uh what
6555,Nichols,Lets finish the job
6556,Gore,No Wait There must be a peaceful
6557,Hawking,Hold him down
6558,Deep Blue,Check
6559,Fry,Ow Ow Ow Ow
6560,Nichols,Somethings wrong Murder isnt working and thats all were good at
6561,Gygax,Lets try something else Maybe we should
6562,Gore,Put the dice away before I take them away
6563,Nichols,Wait Im getting an idea What if Fry was supposed to get frozen
6564,Hawking,Yes Shove him in the tube It was my idea
6565,Bender,Hey there he is again And he brought nerds Take this
6566,Gore,Get in the tube dummy We only have a few seconds before the universe is destroyed
6567,Fry,Alright But I need a weapon to fight off drunken robots when I wake up
6568,Gygax,Here Take my plusone mace
6569,Fry,OK here I go
6570,Gore,You fool You foolish fool
6571,Fry,Eh whats the worst thing that can happen
6572,Hawking,Great The entire universe was destroyed
6573,Fry,Destroyed Then where are we now
6574,Gore,I dont know But I can darn well tell you where were not
6575,Nichols,Eternity with nerds Its the Pasadena Star Trek convention all over again
6576,Gygax,Anyone wanna play Dungeons  Dragons for the next quadrillion years
6577,Fry,Sure
6578,Hawking,I guess
6579,Deep Blue,Pawn to rook 8
6580,Gore,Im a 10thlevel Vice President
6581,Farnsworth,That story was preposterous Stephen Hawking in a pizzeria This thing isnt worth the gold its made of  Anyway the finglonger seems to be arousing success

6737,Fry,We dont have long
6738,Brain Ball #1,We demand bouncing followed by rolling followed by rolling of the third type

6806,Bender,Uh pardon me my good simpleton Could you take us to yon castle
6807,Robot #1,Some say unholy things happen up there
6808,Robot #2,For example
6809,Farnsworth,Fuf Superstitious robot mumbojumbo
6810,Robot #2,Mumbo perhaps Jumbo perhaps not With all your modern science are you any closer to understanding the mystery of how a robot walks or talks
6811,Farnsworth,Yes you idiot  The circuit diagram is right here on the inside of your case
6812,Robot #2,I choose to believe what I was programmed to believe
6813,Robot #2,I will go this far and no further
6814,Preacherbot,I now commend Vladimirs remains to the earth Filings to filings rust to rust
6815,Execu-Tor,To my lazy spoiled son Tandy who never learned the value of a dollar I leave my entire 10 million fortune
6816,Tandy,Is that a lot
6817,Execu-Tor,And to my loving nephew Bender assuming hes not responsible for my death I leave my castle
6818,Bender,Yes Lets stay there tonight
6819,Execu-Tor,On condition that he spend one night within its walls
6820,Bender,Oh man theres always a catch
6821,Bender,Ah I got a good vibe from this place
6822,Leela,What is it
6823,Bender,That painting the eyes are watching me
6824,Farnsworth,Hmm  It has motor eye sensors attached to motion detectors
6825,Bender,So does my butt but I dont frame it and put it on the wall Although  Whats that
6826,Zoidberg,I dont know but its infectious
6827,Bender,No doubt about it this place is haunted
6828,Hermes,Dont be silly mon The last ghost died over 200 years ago
6829,Bender,The last human ghost But robot ghosts
6830,Leela,What does it mean
6831,Bender,Its just gibberish  1010011010
6832,Bender,Uncle Vladimir
6833,Vladimir-Ghost,Come Bender Youll like being dead
6834,Bender,Thats what they said about being alive
6835,Robot Ghosts,Join us Join us Join us Bender
6836,Farnsworth,Just as I suspected These robots were buried in improperlyshielded coffins Their programming leaked into the castles wiring through this old abandoned modem allowing them to project themselves as holograms
6837,Hermes,Of course It was so obvious

6933,Bender,Give us a name MacButt
6934,Calculon,The year was 2019 and I was just a lowly robot arm
6935,Calculon, a savage intelligent military vehicle built from the most evil parts of the most evil cars in all the world The steering wheel from Hitlers staff car the leftturn signal from Charles Mansons VW the windshield wipers from that car that played Knight Rider
6936,Fry,Knight Rider wasnt evil

7987,Bender,The Achilles heel of the Ronco design is its structural resonance frequency Allow me  There we go
7988,Fry,Here it is The Breakfast Club soundtrack
7989,Bender,You mean breakfast club sandwich
7990,Fry,I hid my sevenleaf clover in this very record jacket so my brother Yancy wouldnt get it  The whole place has been cleaned out Yancy stole my clover That thief
7991,Leela,How do you know it didnt disintegrate
7992,Fry,Everything else in here held up OK
7993,Bender,Except Sports by Huey Lewis
7994,Fry,I dont know why my brother hated me so much
7995,Leela,Oh brothers always fight Im sure deep down he loved you He just never got a chance to say it before you got frozen
7996,Fry,You think Cause I always kinda wished that
7997,Bender,Who is that Godlike figure
7998,Fry,Its my brother Yancy And there in his lapel my sevenleaf clover I knew he stole it
7999,Leela,Hold the phone If thats Yancy why does the inscription say Philip J Fry
8000,Fry,Wait a second Thats my name Good Lord He ditched his goofy name and stole mine
8001,Bender,Apparently this brave Adonis this Cadillac of men was the first person on Mars
8002,Fry,First person on Mars I should have been the first person on Mars He stole my clover he stole my name and he stole my life  And now he broke my hand
8003,Bender,His legend lives on
8004,Farnsworth,So you opened the record vault and the clover was gone
8005,Bender,Yep Nothing in there but all the best music of the 1980s in one amazing collection
8006,Leela,Survivor Pat Benatar The Scorpions The list goes on
8007,Fry,That clover helped my ratfink brother steal my dream of going into space Now Ill never get there
8008,Leela,You went there this morning for doughnuts
8009,Hermes,First person on Mars Oh so your brother was that Philip J Fry
8010,Fry,Im Philip J Fry He stole my name after I got frozen
8011,Farnsworth,Shut up friends My Internet browser heard us saying the word Fry and it found a movie about Philip J Fry for us  It also opened my calendar to Friday and ordered me some French fries
8012,Narrator, a feat that has never since been equalled
8013,Fry,That should have been me
8014,Narrator,The everlucky Fry made his fortune after striking oil in the bathroom of the mansion he had won in a lottery
8015,Fry,Thats my clover Yancy stole it
8016,Narrator,After a whirlwind fling with Icelandic supermodel Njörd Fry scored a string of top 10 hits with his rock band Leaf Seven known for their hypnotic rhythms driving baselines and memorable hooks
8017,Fry,Thats what Im known for
8018,Man,Phil came in right strummed out this tune yeah and I said Thats a number one record
8019,Narrator,Today Fry spends most of his time in his grave in Orbiting Meadows National Cemetery buried with the trademark sevenleaf clover that will bring him luck in the next life perhaps some Egyptians believe
8020,Fry,So thats where my clover is Hey is that orbiting cemetery near here
8021,Leela,It will be in a couple hours
8022,Fry,Good Leela Bender were going grave robbing
8023,Bender,Ill get my kit

8026,Mrs. Fry,Ill never forget the day Philip disappeared Wisconsin won the Rose Bowl 179 Oh I miss him
8027,Yancy,Oh that reminds me
8028,Mrs. Fry,Have a look downstairs Your brother may be missing but his crap sure isnt
8029,Yancy,Hmm Breakfast Club Thisll clear out the room at the end of the reception
8030,Leela,They buried your brother in the World Heroes section Im impressed
8031,Fry,I should be the one in that grave
8032,Fry,Hmm We lost Bender
8033,Bender,There Now no one will be able to say I dont own John Larroquettes spine
8034,Fry,Aha My brothers grave
8035,Leela,Philip Fry the original Martian
8036,Fry,Its all lies every word of it He wasnt original he wasnt a Martian he wasnt Philip Fry and since when is he a the
8037,Bender,Youre twice the the he ever was
8038,Fry,Its clovering time
8039,Yancy's wife,So had any ideas for names Yancy
8040,Yancy,Uh Im sorta thinking one  Its a lucky clover that can help you be successful whatever you do  even breakdancing  and it once belonged to someone very special
8041,Yancy's wife,I know what name you wanna give him Yancy Its OK
8042,Yancy,Really  Son Im naming you Philip J Fry in honour of my little brother who I miss every day I love you Philip and I always will
8043,Fry,Here lies Philip J Fry named for his uncle to carry on his spirit
8044,Bender,Pay dirt I got the clover Plus his wedding ring  Sorry ladies Im taken Hey Fry you want me to smack the corpse up a little
8045,Leela,Uh Bender I think Fry needs a moment alone
8046,Bender,Alright grab a shovel Im only one skull short of a Mouseketeer reunion
8047,Leela,Fry I know those cookies are freshalicious but they produce an awful lot of trash
8048,Bender,Ah
8049,Leela,And Bender that aerosol head spray makes your antenna smell nice
8050,Bender,Thank you
8051,Leela,But its doing longterm damage to the planet
8052,Bender,So Its not like its the only one weve got
8053,Farnsworth,Good news everyone Im sending you on an extremely controversial mission
8054,Fry,Controversial
8055,Farnsworth,Oh my no
8056,Farnsworth,For this highly controversial mission youll be towing the Juan Valdez an orbiting supertanker full of rich Columbian dark matter
8057,Leela,Dark matter oil What if we hit something The tanker could leak
8058,Farnsworth,Impossible  Now once youve hauled the tanker past the protestors
8059,Leela,Protestors
8060,Farnsworth,Correct 6000 hulls
8061,Leela,Why do we have to fly within three feet of this penguin preserve on Pluto
8062,Farnsworth,To avoid the tollbooth
8063,Fry,OK shes all restocked with emergency jam Lets get going
8064,Leela,At the risk of sounding negative
8065,Farnsworth,What are you yapping about
8066,Leela,This time its your reckless disregard for the environment In fact Im gonna go join those protestors
8067,Farnsworth,This is an outrage I demand you hand over your captains jacket
8068,Leela,This is my normal jacket Ive had it for 10 years
8069,Farnsworth,I said hand it over  No I shouldnt Because Bender is the new captain
8070,Fry,Bender
8071,Farnsworth,Thats right Being captain is about intuition and heart A good captain cant have either one Thats why cold logical Bender is perfect for the job
8072,Bender,Well I do think of human life as expendable
8073,Fry,No fair Leela was training me to be captain She even let me sit in her lap and steer  in this comic I drew
8074,Zoidberg,Ooh The new ones out
8075,Bender,Fry the title of captain may inflate the human ego but its beneath the notice of my mighty robologic  Now look spry men We launch at six bells
8076,Waterfall Sr.,Greetings Econauts Im Free Waterfall Sr founder of Penguins Unlimited  Please hold your thumbs until the end Now folks its time to stop that tanker with a nonviolent human circle
8077,Leela,Why do we have to resort to nonviolence Cant we just kick their asses
8078,Waterfall Sr.,Now little lady those peoples asses are living things too
8079,Bender,Aye Were hitched up tighter than Davy Jones UHaul At ease men
8080,Fry,I am at ease
8081,Bender,Mr Fry I like to give my first mate an informal nickname From now on you will be known as  Wiggles
8082,Fry,The hell I will Have you even read the Captains Handbook
8083,Bender,I have now And whats Peter Parrots first rule of captaining
8084,Fry,Always respect the chain o command  captain
8085,Bender,Correct Wiggles Youve just earned an invitation to the captains table
8086,Zoidberg,The captains table What an honour
8087,Waterfall Sr.,Our peace ring has em trapped like a tiger in a washing machine
8088,Leela,Get ready
8089,Protestor #1,Look out
8090,Protestor #2,Hold on
8091,Waterfall Sr.,Here they come
8092,Leela,When you were planning this peace ring didnt you realise spaceships can move in three dimensions
8093,Waterfall Sr.,No I did not
8094,Waterfall Sr.,Folks that tanker gave us the slip but well stop em here on Pluto If youre cold rub your bodies with permafrost Its natures long johns  If rubbing frozen dirt in your crotch is wrong hey I dont wanna be right
8095,Waterfall Sr.,This here is our penguin preserve
8096,Leela,Aw Theyre so cute Theyre like if puppies and kittens could have babies
8097,Waterfall Sr.,We use hand puppets around the younguns to simulate a natural environment
8098,Leela,Thats adorable
8099,Bender,But I suppose its this medal Im most proud of Wiggles I won it for saving the children of Earth from a giant kangaroo It was on the Australian news you probably didnt see it
8100,Zoidberg,Brilliant
8101,Fry,Would you cram a sock in it Bender Those arent even medals theyre bottlecaps and pepperoni slices
8102,Bender,Thank you steward Wiggles werent you about to propose a toast to your gallant captain
8103,Fry,Fine Ive got a toast To Captain Bender hes the best    at being a big jerk whos stupid and his big ugly face is as dumb as a butt
8104,Bender,Eh Ive heard better
8105,Fry,If I were in charge I wouldnt treat you like this Youre nothing but a big blowhard
8106,Bender,Sir you forget yourself Shut up
8107,Fry,Being captain is obviously more important to you than being my friend Im going
8108,Bender,Going But a captain cant drink without his first mate
8109,Zoidberg,You can drink with me maybe
8110,Bender,I dont feel like drinking
8111,Zoidberg,Then if youll excuse me I see some ravioli that only has two shoe prints on it  Three
8112,Bender,"Oh Greenland is a barren land
A land that bears no green
Where theres ice and snow
And the whale fishes blow
And the"
8113,Zoidberg,Captain please have some liquor You robots need alcohol to function
8114,Bender,Im a good captain
8115,Zoidberg,Please sir I love you like a father
8116,Protestor #3,Here they come Oh I hope they read my sign
8117,Leela,Benders flying too low And hes upsidedown
8118,Protestor #3,He must be talking on a cell phone
8119,Fry,Whats happening
8120,Zoidberg,All 6000 hulls have been breached
8121,Fry,Oh the fools If only theyd built it with 6001 hulls When will they learn
8122,Linda,story The crisis on Pluto worsens as dark matter spreads throughout the penguin habitat The images are truly horrific
8123,Leela,I dont think any of us can understand how those poor oildrenched penguins feel
8124,Morbo,At the time of the crash the tanker captain had an alcohol level of 08 percent  well below the legal limit for robots
8125,Hyper-Chicken,Son as your lawyer I declare yall are in a 12piece bucket o trouble But I done struck you a deal
8126,Bender,Five hours Aw man Couldnt you just got me the death penalty
8127,Hyper-Chicken,Id have done better but its plum hard pleadin a case while awaitin trial for that there incompetence
8128,Bender,Yeah uh good luck with that
8129,Leela,Now you stay away from those puffin twins
8130,Waterfall Sr.,Good way to avoid frostbite folks
8131,Leela,Uh  I think Ill go check on Bender
8132,Waterfall Sr.,Watch that he doesnt pick your pocket
8133,Bender,Ah cant beat freshsqueezed
8134,Leela,Bender can you at least pretend youre being punished  And clean the black parts too
8135,Smitty,Are they black with white feathers or white with black feathers
8136,URL,It dont matter baby theyre all beautiful
8137,Bender,Yo screws more Tegrin over here  Oh ho Whats this
8138,URL,Aw man He got away
8139,Smitty,I guess this is why Chief says no hugging
8140,Waterfall Sr.,Good work everyone I suggest you all go get some sleep Me well Im gonna stay up all night singing songs about penguins in a fine piercing tenor
8141,Leela,Has anyone seen Bender  Here robot robot robot
8142,Leela,Hey why werent you Kong donkeys outside cleaning up
8143,Zoidberg,They sent us inside for doing an unsatisfactory job  And eating penguin eggs
8144,Fry,You ate most of them So wheres Captain Bender Off catastrophising some other planet
8145,Zoidberg,Damnit Fry He may have done wrong but hes still your captain
8146,Leela,Im worried about him He didnt come back with the group
8147,Fry,He didnt
8148,Leela,No and with windchill its 20 degrees below absolute zero Id better go find him
8149,Fry,Wait Let me Bender and I have our disagreements but were still friends and Im gonna show him what that means  To the ship
8150,Leela,Why dont you just walk He was only about 20 yards from here
8151,Fry,Madam I am in command now
8152,Zoidberg,Such a man Id follow him to hell and back I would
8153,Bender,What the  Whats this water made of ice Forget this
8154,Penguin #1,Full of fish
8155,Bender,Not entirely
8156,Penguin #1,Then lets fish
8157,Zoidberg,Captain I dont think were on Pluto any longer In fact we may have left space as we know it
8158,Fry,Then where are we You said you knew how to navigate
8159,Zoidberg,Stop yelling at me
8160,Waterfall Sr.,Folks its worse than we thought Seems dark matter is natures sex drug Its like a perverted trail mix of penguin oestrogen penguin Viagra and Spanish penguin fly Why its making them ultrafertile
8161,Leela,How ultra
8162,Waterfall Sr.,Well your garden variety penguin lays one egg a year Since the spill our penguins have been laying six eggs every 15 minutes  Also the males are laying eggs
8163,Doctor,This man is overgasped
8164,Waterfall Sr.,If the birds keep multiplying therell soon be too many to count  Before long the penguins will exhaust their food supply and starve to death
8165,Leela,Oh if only we hadnt flown penguins to Pluto and dumped oil on them this might never have happened Cant we stop them from multiplying
8166,Waterfall Sr.,Yes I reckon it is our responsibility And thankfully we have a plan
8167,Leela,What is it Well do anything
8168,Waterfall Sr.,Everyone grab your guns I declare penguin hunting season officially open
8169,Leela,You cant shoot penguins Isnt there some way to keep them from breeding
8170,Waterfall Sr.,Cold showers dont work on Antarctic creatures Now surely you agree that a quick semipainless death is a damn sight better than weeks of starvation
8171,Leela,Well I suppose But I mean I joined Penguins Unlimited to love penguins not to hunt them
8172,Waterfall Sr.,This time the two are one and the same Now are you with us or are you gonna let innocent penguins suffer
8173,Leela,Oh God Its inhuman Its like Hong Kong Ill do it
8174,Waterfall Sr.,Thats a good oldfashioned gun Simple pointandclick interface Rifle check
8175,Hunter #1,Oh yeah
8176,Hunter #2,Wee doggy
8177,Leela,Hey youre enjoying this
8178,Waterfall Sr.,Look nobody enjoys shooting penguins But if you have to shoot penguins well you might as well enjoy it
8179,Leela,Im sorry but if its fun in any way its not environmentalism
8180,Waterfall Sr.,Oh really How bout blowing up dams
8181,Leela,Yeah  that is fun
8182,Waterfall Sr.,Lets conservate
8183,Zoidberg,Its been an honour to serve under you sir
8184,Leela,Alright this is for their own good Dont leave orphans Gotta kill entire families  Whats going on Were you hiding out with these little guys
8185,Bender,Of course not Filthy ice rats Scat Shoo  Gah What are you doing Get away
8186,Leela,Aw They love you
8187,Bender,Well I dont love them  I dont know why but when I look down at their little faces it makes me wanna puke In a good way
8188,Penguins,Stand still Its our only hope
8189,Bender,Thats puffin talk Now follow me
8190,Leela,Stop Stop shooting Its me Leela
8191,Hunter #2,Sorry
8192,Waterfall Sr.,Why arent you firing randomly into those birds little lady Dont you wanna help em
8193,Leela,Not this way
8194,Waterfall Sr.,What Why youre not a treehugging kook at all
8195,Leela,Look I dont know if shooting penguins will help the environment or not But I do know the decision shouldnt be in the hands of people who just wanna kill for fun
8196,Waterfall Sr.,Leela you may just be farming some freerange truth there  On the other hand we already made up 200 pounds of batter for penguin tempura OK boys its them or us
8197,Leela,No
8198,Waterfall Sr.,Hey Whered they
8199,Bender,Attack
8200,Hunter #1,Whoa
8201,Hunter #2,Ow
8202,Bender,We will fight them on the beaches We will fight them on the glaciers
8203,Waterfall Sr.,Make sure they use every part of my body
8204,Old Man Waterfall,Ill avenge your death son
8205,Leela,They used to be such peaceful birds I suppose this was your doing
8206,Bender,Yep Its like I taught em
8207,Leela,Oh if only we had a toboggan
8208,Bender,Faster Faster
8209,Leela,Phew
8210,Bender,Oh phew  Oh right they can swim Its all coming back to me now
8211,Leela,Its Fry
8212,Bender,Wiggles
8213,Leela,Well at least itll help reduce their population
8214,Bender,Yeah life is hilariously cruel  Permission to come aboard Wiggles
8215,Fry,Granted We cant take off without our captain
8216,Bender,Oh and bring my toboggan
8217,Fry,So Leela were you able to help the penguins
8218,Leela,Well sure I mean  not really I mean  nature will work itself out It cant screw things up any worse than we did trying to fix things right
8219,Fry,I unno
8220,Bender,Ah quit your worrying Thanks to my shining influence those stupid birdsll do just fine
8221,Leela,Guidance system

8230,Leela,Sabotage  This is a normal Lunit Without it space travel is but the fevered dream of a madman
8231,Fry,Yep
8232,Bender,Of course
8233,Zoidberg,Doy
8234,Hermes,Its an important unit
8235,Leela,And this my friends is the Lunit I just removed from the ship
8236,Fry,That doesnt look like an L at all Unless you count lowercase
8237,Bender,You know we dont
8238,Leela,Whoever did this was strong This is 340 pounds of Tonkatough steel
8239,Bender,Hmm It should look like this  But instead it looks like this
8240,Fry,Who would do a thing like that
8241,Bender,Who could do a thing like that And by that I mean this
8242,Zoidberg,Well gang it looks like we have another mystery on our hands
8243,Hermes,Id better make a chart of the suspects Ill begin by drawing a line with my straightedge  Sweet lamprey of Santa Fe My edge has been bent
8244,Amy,Now well never beat Jupiter State
8245,Zoidberg,My slinky  My cuddly little pet slinky

8265,Farnsworth,Dear God Weve got robots on the ceiling
8266,Fry,You werent sleepwalking you were sleepbending
8267,Bender,This is quite a shock On the other hand its not surprising in the least After all Ive been bending since the day I was built

8269,Bender,Mama  Hooray I graduated Time to bend around Europe for a few months then get a job bending

8471,Fry,Looks like this planet is next in line
8472,Leela,Thats Earth  The planet we live on
8473,Fry,Id hate to be those guys

8501,Hermes,Look at me Im invisible
8502,Fry,Wait a minute I know whats going on here Youve all become idiots
8503,Bender,Hey lets all join the Reform Party
8504,Hermes,Oh yeah
8505,Ken,Welcome back Lord Nibbler Ambassador to Earth homeworld of the pizza bagel
8506,Nibbler,Thank you I bear many receipts for reimbursement
8507,Fiona,The four welcomes of friendship to you as well Leela We shall manipulate your mind so we appear to be speaking your language Do not be afraid my child
8508,Leela,Im not afraid
8509,Fiona,Uh good Good
8510,Leela,So your real name is Lord Nibbler Thats a coincidence
8511,Nibbler,That name is for your sake In the time it would take to pronounce one letter of my true name a trillion cosmoses would flair into existence and sink into eternal night
8512,Leela,Oh youre all so cute
8513,Ken,No were not  When the universe was forged in the crucible of the Big Bang our mighty race was already 17 years old
8514,Leela,Aww
8515,Ken,For the first millisecond of time things were OK But then there arose a terrible enemy
8516,Nibblonian Chef,Lunch is ready
8517,Ken,Then let the feast of a thousand hams begin
8518,Leela,So why are these Brain Spawn attacking Earth Nibbler
8519,Nibbler,The Brain Spawn hate all consciousness The thoughts of others screech at them like the forced laughs of a billion art house movie patrons
8520,Ken,Thus they travel from world to world making everyone stupid in order to wipe out all thought in the universe
8521,Leela,Wipe out all thought My God Theyre like flying televisions
8522,Fiona,And even we are powerless to stop them fearsome though we are
8523,Nibbler,There is but one being who can resist them A child of destiny whose bizarre brain wave pattern makes him immune to the Brain Spawn attack  The fate of your world perhaps all worlds rests in his special mind
8524,Leela,Now when you say special
8525,Fry,Attention New New Yorkers Stop acting so stupid
8526,Ken,Nibblonian fleet holding at perimeter of moron zone formerly known as Earth
8527,Leela,Why would Fry be immune to the flying brains Because he doesnt shower
8528,Fiona,The Brain Spawn suppress intelligence by attacking the delta brain wave Every animal and robot in the universe generates this wave as do certain trees
8529,Nibbler,Fry however does not
8530,Fiona,Somehow he has cobbled together a random assortment of other brain waves into a working mind
8531,Leela,Like a prom dress made from carpet remnants
8532,Nibbler,Yes like your prom dress
8533,Ken,The Brain Spawn are commanded by a giant evil brain with a gooey centre of pure hate
8534,Fiona,Only Fry with his superior yet inferior mind can approach him You must tell him to disable it We will do the rest
8535,Leela,You can count on me
8536,Fiona,No we cant Once on Earth you will be too stupid to remember the message
8537,Nibbler,Thats why we wrote it down for you
8538,Ken,Weve also prepared a bag lunch and some mittens
8539,Fry,Time to reeducate you duncebags Well start with US presidents  Lets review Who was our first president
8540,Amy,Um
8541,Bender,A pickle jar
8542,Washington,Thomas Jefferson
8543,Fry,Leela Ive been so worried Are you a bonehead
8544,Leela,I  have to tell  must  important  something
8545,Fry,Whoa whoa Slow down Youre going a mile a minute
8546,Leela,This You for this
8547,Fry,Thanks

8549,Farnsworth,The professy will help  Fire indeed hot
8550,Arthur,Oh Chester A Arthur fall down
8551,Leela,Brain Brain make people dumb
8552,Fry,No Leela Brain make people smart
8553,Leela,You go fight biggest brain of all
8554,Fry,Even bigger than those Holy nuts Where is it
8555,Leela,I unno
8556,Fry,Hm A giant brain is basically a giant nerd And where would a giant nerd be  The libary
8557,Big Brain,Pathetic human race Arranging their knowledge by category just made it easier to absorb Dewey you fool your decimal system has played right into my hands  What do you want
8558,Fry,Im here to kick your ass
8559,Big Brain,Wishful thinking We have long since evolved beyond the need for asses  Odd My stupefaction field is having no effect on your ability to think
8560,Fry,Thats right And I think youll find that a little knowledge is a dangerous thing  Thinking  thinking
8561,Big Brain,Oh Stop that
8562,Fry,Hey Thinking hurts him Maybe I can think of a way to use that  Aha Prepare to be thought at Leela give me a topic
8563,Leela,Duh
8564,Fry,Seriously I cant think of anything  Gotta find something to make me think Hardy Boys too easy Nancy Drew too hard Aha Perfect Bonfire of the Vanities
8565,Big Brain,No Its unbearable
8566,Fiona,The brains are weakening  Nibblonians to Nibble stations Prepare cuddle bug for deployment in 40 nibblets
8567,Nibbler,Sometimes I fear we are cute
8568,Fiona,Oh nigglesnoosh
8569,Fry,Take that And that This sentence I dont understand but take this one
8570,Big Brain,You have not won yet  Each book in this room is a gateway to a mental realm and I shall take you there and imprison you forever
8571,Leela,Icky
8572,Fry,Where are we
8573,Ahab,A gold doubloon to the man who first spies the white whale
8574,Queequeg,Big whale over there
8575,Ahab,Arr I saw it first
8576,Queequeg,Wait That no white whale It grey thinky whale
8577,Fry,Queequeg let go of me I have to kill it
8578,Big Brain,Farewell You will all be trapped in this dense symbolist tome forever
8579,Fry,Follow him Its our only way out
8580,Fry,Excuse me have you seen a giant brain
8581,Tom Sawyer,Yep I let him help me whitewash Aunt Pollys fence
8582,Big Brain,Tom Sawyer you tricked me This is less fun than previously indicated Let this corny slice of Americana be your tomb for all eternity
8583,Tom Sawyer,Please no
8584,Fry,Come on
8585,Woman,Mr Fry Mama tells us youre quite the oddity a bachelor at your age
8586,Fry,You think Im an oddity Waitll you see
8587,Butler,Presenting the most eligible landowner in all Hertfordshire Mr Brainly

8598,Fry,Yes Im free  Alright Brain Get ready for some electroshock treatment
8599,Leela,Fry dont die Wake up  Nooo
8600,Fry,Now hes trapped in a book I wrote a crummy world of plot holes and spelling errors
8601,Big Brain,The Big Brain am winning again I am the greetest  Now I am leaving Earth for no raeson
8602,Nibbler,The Big Brain is defeated Let what must be done be done
8603,Leela,Me  feel  a bit better in cognitive faculties
8604,Fry,And its all thanks to the books at my local library
8605,Nibbler,And so life returned to normal or as normal as it gets on this primitive dirtball inhabited by psychotic apes
8606,Nibbler,Thanks to the effect of the brain rays the people of Earth had no memory of what had transpired except Fry and no one believed him or cared what he had to say
8607,Nibbler,I meanwhile returned to my post ever vigilant lest Earth again come under Brain attack And when that day comes God help us God help us all
8608,Leela,Time for a diapy change
8609,Nibbler,End transmission
8610,Humorbot 5.0,So I says Super collider I just met her  And then they built the super collider Thank you youve been a great audience

8626,Hermes,Youre right crabby Hes a hell of a lot funnier than you could ever be

8628,Zoidberg,This letter has to be very personal so Im writing it in my own ink  Dear Uncle Zoid greetings from your longlost nephew Norm and Sam and Sadies boy remember
8629,Zoidberg,Now I am the most important doctor at the delivery company where I work But sadly my life is bereft of laughter

9822,Robot #3,Yo brother thanks for showing that broken robots are still useful
9823,Bender,Aw hang in there folks Ill bet before you know it you guysll be  That is so wrong They cant just melt down broken robots Not right when theyre kissing my ass
9824,Beck,Whoa dog Just cold chill  You know when Im upset I write a song about it Like when I wrote Devils Haircut I was feeling really Whats that song about
9825,Bender,Hey yeah I could write a song With real words not phoney ones like odelay
9826,Beck,Odelay is a word Just look it up in the Becktionary
9827,Bender,Ooh
9828,Bender,Im working on my song Hand me the Becktionary  No no the rhyming Becktionary
9829,Beck,I wish I could help raise awareness about broken robots But what can I do I only weigh eight pounds
9830,Bender,Wait a minute you know lots of rock stars and most of them like to look like they care about things
9831,Beck,We can all get together for a big benefit concert in San Francisco
9832,Bender,And we could call it BendAid after me Bender
9833,Beck,And you can sing that song youre writing

9882,Garfunkel,Bender to start your foundation for broken robots heres a big cardboard cheque for 14000
9883,Cylon,Its been an emotional day for me
9884,Bender,I dont know what to say
9885,Beck,Then maybe you should sing it Lay it down boys
9886,Bender,"Ladies gentlemen smoking heaps of machinery  
 People say my broken friend is useless
But I say his mind is free
Theres lots of things my mangled robot friend could be"
9887,Beck,Kick it
9888,Bender,He could make a good
9889,Bender,and   hatrack
9890,Beck,He only has to stand there
9891,Bender,Or a cheap
9892,Bender,and   doorstop
9893,Beck,He doesnt need to move
9894,Bender,Or a great big
9895,Bender,and   giant Thermos
9896,Bender,With a twistoff top
9897,Beck,That would be good for soup
9898,Bender,He could be a storage closet
9899,Bender,and   for outdated pants
9900,Beck,I like em tight
9901,Bender,My broken friend could do it all
9902,Bender,and   Just give him a chance
9903,Bender,"That robot has a tragic secret
That Id like to share"
9904,Beck,For real
9905,Bender,"My broken friend is closer to me

9944,Bender,Oh no I forgot this is a hoverbridge
9945,Leela,And I forgot this isnt a hovercar
9946,Fry,Is any of that a problem
9947,Zoidberg,Not if youve lived a life without regret
9948,Bender,Ill save me
9949,Leela,Quick grab his footcups
9950,Bender,Hey What No

9959,Bender,Well it was worth a shot
9960,Fry,Cmon Bender If youre done scamming Beck were heading home
9961,Bender,"Alright alright Let me just do one thing to cheer myself up

Fry cracked corn
And I dont care
Leela cracked corn
I still dont care
Bender cracked corn
And he is great
Take that you stupid corn"
9962,Hermes,Go get it boy
9963,Fry,So Leela how about a romantic ride in one of those swan boats Theyre kinda dangerous but I finally mastered them
9964,Leela,Those arent swan boats theyre swans
9965,Fry,Oh That explains these boat eggs
9966,Farnsworth,Wha
9967,Tate,Pitiful ballplayers of Earth I am Ethan Bubblegum Tate commander of the Harlem Globetrotters  Will no one meet our challenge Have none of you pathetic Earthlings game
9968,Fry,What happens if we lose
9969,Tate,Nothing Theres nothing at stake and no threat beyond the shame of defeat
9970,Farnsworth,This will not stand  Ill take you on you airballing bozos
9971,Tate,You old man Sweet Clyde laugh derisively at him
9972,Farnsworth,I may be an old man In fact Im fairly sure I am But Ill put you Globetrotters in your place with my team of mutant atomic supermen
9973,Hermes,Hooray Professor
9974,Farnsworth,Behold
9975,Leela,Theyre only a foot high Professor
9976,Farnsworth,Well theyre still young Mere atomic super boys really Well need to speed up their growth with time particles called Chronitons
9977,Bender,Arent those the particles that destroyed an entire civilisa
9978,Farnsworth,Good news everyone Youre off to the Tempus Nebula to gather Chronitons
9979,Fry,Hey Leela look at me
9980,Leela,Your face can take a lot of punishment Thats good to know
9981,Fry,Theres a lot about my face you dont know Perhaps you and it could get better acquainted over dinner
9982,Leela,Alright Cool your jets hotshot
9983,Fry,Cmon Leela why wont you go out with me We both know theres something there
9984,Leela,No I mean cool your jets Theyre melting Benders face
9985,Bender,Ow Oh my God Ow
9986,Leela,Here you go Hot off the nebula
9987,Farnsworth,None too soon While you were gone the Trotters held a news conference to announce that I was a jive sucker  Behold My invincible nuclear mutants
9988,Amy,Hi
9989,Arachneon,Hello
9990,Albert,Marv Albert here at Madison Cube Garden where the Harlem Globetrotters take on a squad of atomic supermen in what promises to be a bythenumbers athletic contest with no surprises whatsoever  Heres the tipoff Globetrotter ball Sweet Clyde Dixon to Bubblegum Tate Drives downcourt And Curly Joe from the rear
9991,Zoidberg,That one grabbed his behindus
9992,Leela,Sh
9993,Hermes,Quiet
9994,Tate,Who dares laugh at the Jesters of Dunk We came to terrify and humiliate you not tickle your funnybones Watch as I embarrass your civilisation by passing the ball to Curly Joe  And perhaps this will wipe the smiles from your faces
9995,Albert,Goosh goes up  Yes
9996,Albert,Supermen lead 4542 Arachneon with the steal to Thorias Thorias from downtown  Yes Hes really showing us what a man with a cannon in his chest can do
9997,Farnsworth,No showboarding you atomic hotdog
9998,Albert,And thats the half with the Supermen up 4842 Surprisingly dull so far  Bubblegum the Trotters are down by six Reactions
9999,Tate,It was always our plan to trail at the half thus deepening Earths eventual humiliation Also what game were the refs watching
10000,Albert,Curly Joe easily amused by his own antics    continues to wreak havoc on
10001,Farnsworth,What the  Did everything just jump around or did my brain just stroke off there for a second
10002,Albert,Ladies and gentlemen something very strange has just happened in this basketball game between space clowns and atomic monsters
10003,Farnsworth,Timeout Timeout
10004,Fry,Whats happening
10005,Farnsworth,We seem to be lurching forward randomly in time like a needle skipping on a record player
10006,Amy,Whats causing it Is it my outfit
10007,Farnsworth,No It must have something to do with those time particles I used to grow the Supermen Time and space are ripping apart at the seams
10008,Thorias,Oops
10009,Farnsworth,Oh great Now on top of everything we need a new fifth man
10010,Fry,Ooh Ooh Ooh Put me in Professor I wanna show Leela my skills
10011,Farnsworth,Hmm Will said skills pay the bills
10012,Fry,Who cares Were 35 points ahead with two minutes left What could possibly
10013,Albert,Globetrotters win 24486 A dark day for humanity folks We have been beaten  in basketball
10014,Curly Joe,Yeah thats how we do it
10015,'Sweet' Clyde,Hows that
10016,Tate,You are all fools of the highest calibre
10017,Leela,I dont know what you did Fry but once again you screwed up Now all the planets are gonna start cracking wise about our mamas
10018,Hermes,Im just glad my fat ugly mama isnt alive to see this day
10019,Farnsworth,Enough about your promiscuous mother Hermes We have bigger problems This time disruption is extremely serious
10020,Tate,Damn right brother man This chronological wangdangdoodle could destroy the very matrix of reality
10021,Farnsworth,Tate What do you know about this
10022,Tate,Not much yet But I am senior lecturer of physics at Globetrotter U And Id like to help you investigate
10023,Farnsworth,Youre that Bubblegum Tate
10024,Tate,Well I sure aint his grandma Now look here Prof  I think we got ourselves an excess of Chronitons in the subatomic interstices
10025,Farnsworth,Yes I see Something involving that many big words could easily destabilise time itself
10026,Fry,Is that a problem
10027,Farnsworth,Indeed so At this rate by Tuesday it will be Thursday by Wednesday it will be August and by Thursday it will be the end of existence as we know it
10028,Man,Ill have to ask you to clear out now The circus need to set up for tomorrows big
10029,Linda,Time continues to skip forward randomly Details at 11
10030,Linda,This is the news at 11 The mysterious and unexplained
10031,Linda,Turning to entertainment news teen singer Wendy might just be the latest
10032,Linda,won three Grammys last night
10033,Linda,found dead in her bathtub
10034,Farnsworth,Interesting Its as if we behave normally during the time skips but then we have no memory of it
10035,Fry,You mean we just
10036,Farnsworth,My yes Ooh just like that Any luck Bubblegum
10037,Tate,Not yet Listen I hope you dont mind if I dribble a little while I work
10038,Farnsworth,Not if youll grant me the same liberty
10039,Bender,Ooh Ooh Bubblegum My names Bender and Im a huge fan of your work both on and off the court Can I be a Globetrotter
10040,Tate,Shut up turkey
10041,Farnsworth,Bubblegum look at this The background time radiation is fluctuating wildly
10042,Tate,Good Lord That suckers shaking around like some fine imported booty
10043,Hermes,Say Im no physicist but I think I know how to stop the skipping Well just
10044,Hermes,I dont know how this was suppose to work
10045,Amy,Professor I hope you find out whats wrong before we skip right past my birth
10046,All,ppy birthday Amy
10047,Amy,Hooray Look at all these presents
10048,Zoidberg,I hope we all have as much tomorrow at my birth
10049,Zoidberg,What
10050,Fry,Psst Leela Ive set up a timeproof shelter in the closet Theres only room for two and youre the one I wanna share it with
10051,Leela,Fry thats so sweet Let me see
10052,Leela,How exactly will this protect us from time jumps
10053,Fry,Because when were together in here baby time will stand still
10054,Fry,Ow
10055,Zoidberg,Hmm  Hmm
10056,Leela,Dr Zoidberg can I talk to you about Fry
10057,Zoidberg,Leela I would be honoured
10058,Leela,does the worst WC Fields imitation Ive ever seen Zoidberg
10059,Zoidberg,Sorry you must have been boring me
10060,Leela,The thing is Fry is very sweet but hes so immature I love his boyish charm but I hate his childishness
10061,Zoidberg,So hes not perfect You dont wanna end up old and lonely like Zoidberg  You were saying
10062,Farnsworth,Ah there is it The Tempus Nebula Take a whiff through the Smellescope
10063,Tate,Whats that funky jazz
10064,Farnsworth,The odour of pure time leaking When my crew removed the Chronitons it destabilised the nebula causing time skips throughout the universe
10065,Bender,Ooh Let Bubblegum tell it
10066,Tate,Pretend these basketballs are time particles my silver honky As the nebula bouncepasses them off us    they cause these dents or time skips
10067,Bender,You are so smart
10068,Tate,Hold up What if we were to move this cluster of starts to these algebraic coordinates
10069,Farnsworth,Their gravity might just divert the Chronitons to the empty side of the universe
10070,Tate,Yeah But is it possible Moving stars would require one badass gravity pump And wed need all the money on Earth to
10071,Tate,What the
10072,Farnsworth,Wha
10073,Nixon,Heres the funding for your gravity pump But it damn well better work We cant spend all of Earths money every day Now how long will it take to build
10074,Tate,It wont be easy Nixon A jimjam this complex might take months or even
10075,Farnsworth,Ah there we are One gravity pump  Powerful enough to move the stars themselves Now to begin the arduous task of attaching it to the ship so th
10076,Farnsworth,Off you go apparently
10077,Tate,Easy Leela Just fingerroll that star to the cosmic basket
10078,Leela,Just a few  more  hundred  thousand  miles There
10079,Tate,Nothing but nebula
10080,Leela,Well have to run some tests back on Earth but I think weve stopped the time skips
10081,Bender,Alright
10082,Tate,Jamming
10083,Fry,Hooray for Leela
10084,Bender,And what better way to celebrate our success than by me showing Bubblegum the Globetrotter uniform I made myself
10085,Tate,Let me see  Hello lawsuit
10086,Fry,Leela I want you to know I think the way you moved those stars around was really wonderful I got you something
10087,Leela,Moderatelypriced domestic nonvintage champagne How did you know
10088,Fry,You deserve it I mean nobody ever stops to tell you what a great captain you are
10089,Leela,Aw That is so true and sweet
10090,Fry,Youre smart youre beautiful and best of all youll go out with mee
10091,Leela,Fry please try to understand
10092,Bender,Hey Leela Bubblegum might let me organise a bake sale for the Globetrotter wives Can you teach me to make cupcakes
10093,Leela,Alright but I wanna lick the beaters
10094,Fry,I got her champagne I opened it What does a guy have to do
10095,Tate,86 the chump stuff Fman Its time to win Leelas heart with a bigshowy threepoint romantic gesture
10096,Fry,Hmm Maybe this is the moment to show her my real surprise
10097,Leela,Fry what are you doing
10098,Tate,Uhoh Time to boogie on down to the sauna
10099,Fry,Look Ive been studying how to pilot the ship Impressed
10100,Leela,Yeah actually Youre doing OK The core reactor temperatures nominal the blinkers off
10101,Fry,I learned how to work the gravity pump too In case we need to move more stars So are we dating now
10102,Leela,Is that what this is all about Please just cut it out now
10103,Fry,Look Leela I know theres some perfect amazing thing I can do to make you love me and when I figure out what it is
10104,Leela,Fry stop I dont wanna hurt you but there is absolutely positively no way that you and I will ever ever
10105,Preacherbot,man and wife You may kiss the bride
10106,Albert,Yes
10107,Zoidberg,He looks radiant
10108,Farnsworth,Ye Gods Bubblegum We failed The time skips havent stopped at all
10109,Tate,Even in these formal shorts I feel like a failure
10110,Leela,You tricked me into marrying you didnt you
10111,Fry,Of course not
10112,Leela,Howd you do it Drugs in the champagne Hypnosis
10113,Fry,No Drugs are for losers and hypnosis is for losers with big weird eyebrows I dont know what amazing thing I did you make you love me but whatever it was were married now Weve got the rest of our lives to work
10114,Whitey,Divorce is final
10115,Fry,What
10116,Leela,Well lets divide up the china I guess Ill take the NFC helmets and you can have the AFC helmets
10117,Fry,Fine Break my heart again
10118,Zoidberg,Dont be so hard on yourself Fry You lost the woman of your dreams but you still have Zoidberg You all still have Zoidberg
10119,Fry,How did I do it How did I get Leela to love me Ive got to figure it out
10120,Hermes,Maybe youre just a fantastic lover Fry
10121,Amy,Um no
10122,Fry,I dont know what Im doing
10123,Bender,Maybe shed come back to you if your best friend Bender were a Globetrotter What do you say Bubblegum
10124,Tate,Hell no
10125,Fry,Oh its hopeless I did something so great that it won Leelas heart and Ill never ever know what it was My life is empty
10126,Zoidberg,Zoidberg
10127,Farnsworth,No wonder we failed to stop the time skips Diverting Chronitons is mathematically impossible I knew I should have checked your showboating Globetrotter algebra
10128,Tate,Man I thought you knew that algebra was all razzmatazz A Globetrotter always saves the good algebra for the final minutes
10129,Bender,Vintage Bubblegum
10130,Farnsworth,The time skips are worse than ever now Isolated spots are jumping by years at a time Look
10131,Boy,Stupid senior citizens Why should we have to pay for their social security benefits
10132,Old Man,I deserve free money
10133,Farnsworth,Well Im stumped Well have to call in the finest scientific minds in the univ
10134,Farnsworth,Perhaps we could explode the whole damned nebula What do you think Curly Joe
10135,Curly Joe,No man An explosion big enough to destroy that mama would take out half the universe
10136,Sweet Clyde,You gotta Globetrotter that explosion up a little Farnsy Make it an implosion
10137,Farnsworth,By God Sweet Clyde is right An implosion might just form a black hole that would stop more Chronitons from escaping
10138,Tate,Whoa Slow that brain train down Prof Wed need some kind of doomsday device to initiate an implosion like that
10139,Farnsworth,Doomsday device Ah Now the balls in Farnsworths court  I suppose I could part with one and still be feared
10140,Tate,Give me some skin Prof Im making you an honorary Globetrotter In fact everybody in this rooms an honorary Globetrotter
10141,Amy,Hooray
10142,Hermes,Yes
10143,Zoidberg,Im a Globetrotter
10144,Bender,Did you just say
10145,Tate,Too late hot plate
10146,Bender,Oh crap
10147,Tate,We must leave now for we are needed elsewhere But we wish you Godspeed
10148,Bender,Please please let me come with you I can make myself taller
10149,Tate,Bender you can talk trash you can handle the ball But look in your heart and ask yourself
10150,Bender,Yes
10151,Tate,Are you
10152,Bender,I mean with time my funk level could
10153,Tate,Are you
10154,Bender,No
10155,Tate,Deal with it
10156,Bender,Oh No
10157,Leela,Careful with that doomsday device Bender
10158,Bender,What does it matter Ill never be a Globetrotter My life and by extension everyone elses is meaningless
10159,Leela,Roger
10160,Fry,Leela about the wedding I dont know what I did to make you love me and I dont think I tricked you into it but maybe I did And if I did Im sorry
10161,Leela,Its OK Fry You know well always be friends right
10162,Fry,Yeah But I dont guess anything I could do will ever make you feel the same way about me that I do about you
10163,Leela,I guess not
10164,Bender,Well the doomsday device is ready Maybe blasting this quadrant of space into a hell storm of flaming nothingness will cheer me up a little
10165,Leela,OK Let me just take the ship out to a safe distance  Actually I think Ill go down and prep the detonator Fry why dont you take the helm
10166,Fry,Shes so great I feel like I can almost remember the magical thing I did to make her love me But I guess I never will
10167,Bender,Sorry buddy I too know what its like to have a dream Ill never achieve
10168,Fry,Oh  Thats how I must have done it I moved the stars themselves to write her a love note in the sky
10169,Leela,Detonation in three two one
10170,Fry,Did you see it Did you see it
10171,Bender,The explosion
10172,Fry,No not the explosion

10665,Leela,Impressive Whos building it
10666,Osiran,You
10667,Leela,Say again

10669,Fry,Call it a hunch but Ive got a bad feeling about this
10670,Fry,You know the worst thing about being a slave They make you work but they dont pay you or let you go
10671,Leela,Thats the only thing about being a slave
10672,Osiran,Attention You are now possessions of the great Pharaoh Hermenthotip heir to the Tenth Dynasty bringer of the good aspects of the annual floods
10673,Fry,Incredible This place is just like the Ancient Egypt of my day
10674,Osiran,That is no coincidence For our people visited your Egypt thousands of years ago
10675,Fry,I knew it Insane theories one regular theories a billion
10676,Osiran,We learned many things from the mighty Egyptians such as pyramidbuilding space travel and how to prepare our dead so as to scare Abbott and Costello
10677,Fry,Also Wolfman
10678,Bender,Look at these swanky tombs These people really know how to die
10679,Leela,Are you crazy They worked thousands of people to death to make these stupid monuments

10705,High Priest,We commend the body of Hermenthotip to the abode of the damned The damned good looking  Pharaoh commanded me to tell that joke at his funeral
10706,Bender,Ill always remember you Hermenthotip
10707,High Priest,To equip Pharaoh for his journey we bury him with his favourite possessions Such as his heart and liver  Also this bag of cats our culture considers holy
10708,Singer,"Pharaoh my Godking
You are cold and deceased
I used to have him sing"
10709,Singer,PPPPharaoh and his pets
10710,Singer,"But the years went by
And Pharaoh died
Suzie will have joined him in the afterlife"
10711,Osiran,Hermenthotip is gone The time to designate a new Pharaoh is at hand
10712,Bender,Wow
10713,Osiran,At dawn tomorrow the high priest will consult the Wall of Prophecy to determine Hermenthotips successor  That concludes the funeral You dont have to go home but you cant stay here
10714,Fry,Can you believe it Pharaohs dead
10715,Slave #1,Yes Tonight we are slaves to no one except the rhythm
10716,Leela,Yeah Play those bongos
10717,Fry,Im gonna spin till I fall down
10718,Bender,We interrupt this ancient prophecy to bring you latebreaking bulletin He hammers the back of his head and creates and imprint of himself on the wall
10719,High Priest,Great Wall of Prophecy reveal to us Gods will that we may blindly obey
10720,Priests,Free us from thought and responsibility
10721,High Priest,We shall read things off you
10722,Priests,Then do them
10723,High Priest,Your words guide us
10724,Priests,Were dumb
10725,Fry,You know what else stinks about being a slave The hours
10726,High Priest,The prophecy is strange and crudely drawn at best It indicates that we are here and our next Pharaoh is over there near some  tents
10727,Bender,Those are waves jackass Its supposed to be a river
10728,Fry,Hey I think I know who the next Pharaoh is
10729,Leela,Oh Lord
10730,High Priest,We hear your voice oh great Pharaoh Reveal yourself to us
10731,Bender,Behold I have emerged from the place of spells and fairies

10798,Farnsworth,Oh Lordy Lou there he goes again Well lets give baby what he wants  What if Bender were human
10799,Farnsworth,Good news everyone Ive invented a way to turn Bender into a human using a process I call reverse fossilisation
10800,Leela,How does it work
10801,Farnsworth,Well in regular fossilisation flesh and bone turn to minerals Realising that it was a simple matter to reverse the process Ive already tested it by turning the toaster into a racoon
10802,Fry,Kinda gamey
10803,Farnsworth,Are you ready Bender
10804,Bender,I dunno Im beginning to have some second thoughts

10841,Farnsworth,And um thats why I believe I deserve the Nobel Prize
10842,Wernstrom,Not only do you not deserve a Nobel Prize for loosing this bloated manball on the world but you are hereby kicked out of the Academy of Science
10843,Bender,Wait As men of science are not your minds open to new ideas I say do not judge me until you have tried my way of life for yourselves

11227,Malachi,The farmers pray for sunlight so their barley might make a more refreshing beer for todays God on the go
11228,Bender,Very well Let there be light  Um when youre writing the Bible you might want to omit that last miracle
11229,Fry,He decided not to let go  I cant believe youre gone I wont If I cant reach you physically Ill just have to try something desperate and crazy
11230,Fry,So thats my story Father Changstein el Gamahl Is there anything religion can do to help me find my friend
11231,Changstein el Gamahl,Well we could join together in prayer
11232,Fry,Uhhuh But is there anything useful we can do
11233,Changstein el Gamahl,No
11234,Gypsy,Sure I hold séance channel your friend no problem Insert coin  I am your friend Bonder
11235,Fry,Bonder Is it really you
11236,Gypsy,Yes I am fine Give the gypsy 10
11237,Fry,Wait a minute Benders name isnt Bonder its Bender Youre a fraud
11238,Gypsy,Look you want false hope or not
11239,Fry,Only if you dont have any real hope
11240,Gypsy,Well there is perhaps one way Have you heard of the Monks of Dschubba
11241,Fry,Ive not heard of them
11242,Gypsy,They are an ancient order that believes God exists somewhere in the depths of space They have built the universes most powerful radio telescope high in the Himalayas to search for him
11243,Fry,You think theyd let me use it to look for Bender
11244,Gypsy,What am I psychic I mean yes Yes ImIm sure they will Yes
11245,Malachi,Oh Metal Lord hear my prayer
11246,Bender,Yes Malachi what is it this time
11247,Malachi,My Lord the infidels on your back no longer believe in you They say their prayers go unheeded
11248,Bender,Of course theyre unheeded How am I supposed to hear prayers coming out of my ass
11249,Malachi,They talk of war against the faithful I beseech thee Rise up against them Smite someone who deserves it for once
11250,Bender,Malachi every time I interfere I only make things worse Youre best off solving your own problems
11251,Malachi,ButBut Metal Lord
11252,Bender,What part of nay doesnt thou understand
11253,Fry,Sir Im outfitting an expedition to a monastery high in the Himalayas Ill need a longsleeved coat
11254,Leela,Look I miss Bender almost half as much as you do but you cant bring him back this way Its hopeless
11255,Fry,You cant give up hope just because its hopeless You gotta hope even more and cover your ears and go blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah  Id also like a pack mule
11256,Salesman,At once sir
11257,Leela,Well you obviously wont listen to reason so I guess Ill listen to idioticness and come with you But well need a sherpa to guide us
11258,Bender,Now thats one Bible that doesnt disappoint on every page Looks like societys running pretty well without my meddling  Atomic bombs Oh no Those unbelievers from my backside must have found my nuclear pile
11259,Malachi,Fear not my Lord We shall be with you soon
11260,Bender,Youre with me now This is the maximum level of being with me
11261,Malachi,We will solve our own problems as you commanded The time has come to convert the unbelievers
11262,Bender,Convert them
11263,Malachi,To radioactive vapour
11264,Malachi Jr.,Look Daddy Im hugging God Mmm Mmm Maybe if I hug him real hard hell save us from
11265,Bender,Ooh It tickles
11266,Bender,Hello Is anyone still alive How about in the porno theatre  Theyre dead All dead Who would have known playing God could have such terrible consequences
11267,Leela,Fry if I drop dead from exhaustion make sure my body freezes in a dignified position None of that huddled over for warmth crap
11268,Namgyal,Behold The Monastery of Dschubba I must leave you now for I am not holy enough to enter
11269,Fry,OK
11270,Leela,Looks rickety Wed better test it
11271,Female Voice,Welcome to our monastery Please stand to one side to let faster pilgrims by
11272,Bender,Hey That galaxys signalling in binary I gotta signal back But I only know enough binary to ask where the bathroom is  You speak English
11273,Galaxy,I do now
11274,Bender,What are you Some kind of galactic computer
11275,Galaxy,Possible I am user friendly my good chum
11276,Bender,Who built you
11277,Galaxy,I have always been
11278,Bender,Oh my God Are you God
11279,"""God""",Possible I do feel compassion for all living things my good chum
11280,Bender,But why would God think in binary Unless  youre not God but the remains of a computerised space probe that collided with God
11281,"""God""",That seems probable
11282,Monk #1,A member of our brotherhood sits at these controls every hour of every day scanning the heavens for God
11283,Monk #2,There he is No No wait no
11284,Leela,How long have you been at it
11285,Monk #1,700 years Weve not yet examined onetenmillionth of the sky But we will go on until we find the Almighty even if it takes till the end of time
11286,Fry,And then what
11287,Monk #1,Then we utter unto him a short prayer You see the telescope is also an amplifying transmitter
11288,Leela,Sort of like a giant karaoke machine
11289,Monk #1,Not really Would you like to see our giant karaoke machine
11290,Leela,Not really
11291,Fry,Hmm Finding God ThatThats important yeah But you know what might be a treat for everyone If you let me use the telescope to find my lost friend Bender
11292,Monk #1,I dont know what to say other than absolutely not Your loss is a tragedy but our work
11293,Fry,Aw come on You guys have forever to look for God All Im asking is one measly lifetime to find my friend
11294,Monk #2,He speaks out of love for his friend Perhaps that love in his heart is God
11295,Monk #1,Oh how convenient A theory about God that doesnt require looking through a telescope Get back to work
11296,Fry,That telescope is as much mine as anybodys Im using it whether you give me permission or not
11297,Leela,Hiyah Your order may be famous for your martial arts but Ive never met a holy man I couldnt clobber
11298,Monk #1,Actually we only practise martial arts as a form of meditation We are a strictly nonviolent sect
11299,Leela,Oh Then get in the laundry room or Ill kick your butts
11300,Monk #3,This is the worst crazy sect Ive ever been in
11301,Bender,So do you know what Im gonna do before I do it
11302,"""God""",Yes
11303,Bender,What if I do something different
11304,"""God""",Then I dont know that
11305,Bender,Cool Cool I bet a lot of people pray to you huh
11306,"""God""",Yes But there are so many asking so much After a while you just sorta tune it out
11307,Bender,Yknow I was God once
11308,"""God""",Yes I saw You were doing well until everyone died
11309,Bender,It was awful I tried helping them I tried not helping them but in the end I couldnt do them any good Do you think what I did was wrong
11310,"""God""",Right and wrong are just words What matters is what you do
11311,Bender,Yeah I know thats why I asked if what I did Forget it
11312,"""God""",Bender being God isnt easy If you do too much people get dependent on you And if you do nothing they lose hope You have to use a light touch like a safecracker or a pickpocket
11313,Bender,Or a guy who burns down the bar for the insurance money
11314,"""God""",Yes if you make it look like an electrical thing When you do things right people wont be sure youve done anything at all
11315,Bender,Does that mean you wouldnt send me back to Earth even if I prayed to you
11316,"""God""",Earth Which way is that
11317,Bender,I dont know
11318,Fry,Bender Bender
11319,Monk #2,Let us out We cooked our shoes in the dryer and ate them Now were bored
11320,Fry,Hello Has anyone out there seen Bender
11321,H.G. Blob,No Quit asking
11322,Leela,Fry its been three days And even if you stay here the rest of your life there is virtually no chance of finding him Its time to give up
11323,Fry,But still I wish I had Bender back
11324,"""God""",Huh
11325,Bender,Huh Wha You say something
11326,"""God""",No no Well so long Remember what we talked about
11327,Bender,Hot hot hot hot
11328,Fry,Bender Its a miracle  Ow
11329,Leela,This is by a wide margin the least likely thing that has ever happened
11330,Bender,Guys youll never believe what happened First I was God then I met God
11331,Fry,We climbed a mountain and locked up some monks
11332,Leela,Oh no The monks We forgot to let them out of the laundry room
11333,Fry,Do we have to I mean theyre monks Im sure their God will let them out or at least give them more shoes to eat
11334,Bender,Fat chance You cant count on God for jack He pretty much told me so himself Now come on If we dont save those monks no one will
11335,"""God""",When you do things right people wont be sure youve done anything at all
11336,Man,Yes Good thing I noticed the similar shapes
11337,Hermes,Planet Express stockholders I present our chief executive officer Professor Hubert Farnsworth

11352,Rabbi-bot,We believe he was built and that he was a very well programmed robot But he wasnt our Messiah
11353,Narrator,And so our company flames onwards Planet Express
11354,Hermes,Its been a terrible year people The company is on the verge of bankruptcy
11355,Leela,But the movie
11356,Hermes,Was a substantial loss for the company  The blue slice represents the money we earned from shipping packages while the green slice represents an 8 bank error in our favour
11357,Leela,This toads the wet sprocket What about out thousands of shares of stock
11358,Hermes,Worthless
11359,Bender,Ill kill you
11360,Hattie,I own one share of Planet kajiggers so Im entitled to some answers Question 1

11368,Fry,Boneitis Pft Thats a funny name for a horrible disease
11369,Steve Castle,There was no cure at the time One drug company was close but I arranged a hostile takeover and sold off all the assets Made a cool hundred mil  Naturally I froze myself until a cure was found Now here I am ready to sleaze my way back to the top 80s style
11370,Caveman,As a caveman frozen in a glacier I face different challenges  The hardest thing was seeing my wife on display in the British Museum
11371,Fry,Hey buddy Im from the same time as you Remember that song Safety Dance
11372,Steve Castle,Sure do We can dance
11373,Fry,Yknow that dance wasnt as safe as they said it was
11374,Steve Castle,I tell you
11375,Fry,No question
11376,Steve Castle,If only someone would give us a shot
11377,Fry,Theyre scared of our raw power Oh but if you want a job I could beg everyone at the company where I work
11378,Steve Castle,Awesome Awesome to the max
11379,Hermes,And finally the post office meter is for business mail only
11380,Bender,Aw come on Ive got a lot of ransom notes to send

11393,Hermes,Yeah the Professor
11394,Farnsworth,Me
11395,Fry,I nominate That Guy Not just because he has a suit but because he knows about business and stuff and he has a tie  My shares still count if they went through the washing machine right
11396,Hermes,Well if I know anything about which number is bigger than the other number Id say that
11397,Scruffy,Now hold on there Scruffy votes his 40000 shares for the mysterious stranger
11398,Leela,40000 How come you have fourtimes as much stock as the rest of us
11399,Scruffy,Scruffy believes in this company
11400,Hermes,Then we have a tie And in the event of a tie the Professor as the current CEO remains
11401,Hattie,I demand the floor I may only have one share but I get to vote same as anyone And Im voting against the cathater  Hey You ate my change
11402,Hermes,Then its settled The new chief executive officer of Planet Express corporation is That Guy

11603,Bender,And this time I mean it
11604,Bender,Aw who am I kidding It was stupid of me to ever dream of becoming a chef I dont have what it takes and nothing can change that  Then its settled Elzar will teach me to cook
11605,Elzar,Absolutely not
11606,Bender,But I watch your show You owe me

11617,Bender,What did you call me
11618,Gus,A robo You know A robothobo
11619,Bender,Oh OK I thought you said romo
11620,Dandy Jim,No offence intended my filthy friend In fact why not join us and ride the space rails

11622,Dandy Jim,Were going nearly the speed of light so uh roll when you land
11623,Bender,Ow
11624,Gus,Welcome to Bumbase Alpha the biggest hobo jungle in the quadrant
11625,Bender,Ive seen bigger Oh wait Im thinking of Eugene Oregon  Wait A pie with hobolifting aroma Who baked it
11626,Gus,Helmut Spargle He used to be the greatest chef ever
11627,Dandy Jim,His restaurant was so hightoned the only way to get reservations was to create a parallel universe where you already had reservations
11628,Gus,Yep I once ate there back when I what was a senator
11629,Bender,Yo Spargle If youre such a great cook howd you end up in this dump
11630,Spargle,Ages ago I was the host of a TV show
11631,Spargle,Down Home Country Kitchen Mit Helmut Spargle But one day the extreme soda company that sponsored the show decided it was too oldfashioned
11632,Man,Spargle youre fired We need a chef who can attract todays younger more extreme cooking show viewer
11633,Spargle,Elzar
11634,Elzar,Get lost old man Bam
11635,Spargle,Mein soufflé
11636,Spargle,Elzar had been seduced by the dark side of cooking Cilantro mango salsa raspberry vinaigrette
11637,Bender,That twizzler
11638,Spargle,As for me I went temporarily insane and vound up here making pies out of shoes
11639,Bender,My storys a lot like yours only more interesting cause it involves robots That jerk Elzar ruined my dream of being a chef too
11640,Spargle,Interesting You wish to become a cook but as a robot you have no sense of taste
11641,Bender,Its so unfair I have eight other senses but Id trade them all even smission to be able to taste
11642,Spargle,You dont understand Without the distraction of taste your mind is free to touch the Zen of pure flavour You could become the greatest chef ever
11643,Bender,I could
11644,Spargle,Yes Just as Beethoven was a great composer because he was deaf
11645,Bender,Or like how Rembrandt was blind and had wooden hands
11646,Spargle,Bender hear me well I shall train you But first you must forget everything you know about cooking
11647,Bender,Done
11648,Farnsworth,Thats right Ricardo A ship in a bottle Whats that Well hang on Ill look
11649,Ricardo,Ola Professor Qué pasa
11650,Farnsworth,Ive gathered you all here in the accusing parlour because one of you is a miniature ship wrecker
11651,Zoidberg,Im acting astonished
11652,Farnsworth,Certain clues suggest that the culprit is none other than our own  Philip J Fry
11653,Fry,What
11654,Farnsworth,Oh it was a brilliant scheme But you made one fatal mistake  leaving this confession note
11655,Zoidberg,Fry you scoundrel
11656,Fry,Well I dont remember any of that but I dont have the wherewithal to defend myself
11657,Farnsworth,Then I have no choice but to charge you the full cost of the materials
11658,Fry,There you go
11659,Zoidberg,What have I done
11660,Spargle,Your training is complete little dessert spoon Now just as the man who wishes to be world chess champion must win at least one game of chess so must you serve at least one edible meal  of perfect flavour
11661,Gus,Ooh yeah
11662,Bender,Slops on
11663,Gus,Fine lookin eats
11664,Spargle,It is  acceptable

11669,Bender,A diamond vial of Mrs Dash
11670,Spargle,Oh There goes my  life
11671,Bender,Ill avenge you master I swear in the presence of these drunken bums that I shall defeat Elzar
11672,Gus,Oh Im not drunk Im mentally ill But I likes what what you said
11673,Bender,Elzar Im a walking pile of your unfinished business
11674,Elzar,Why you

11676,Elzar,Spargle huh What he do bland himself to death
11677,Bender,No He was eating some food I made and by a crazy coincidence his stomach exploded Now Im here to avenge him
11678,Elzar,OK but it seems like youre the one who killed him
11679,Bender,Maybe so but you are his sworn enemy I challenge you to a battle of the chefs
11680,Customer,Scandalous
11681,Elzar,Very well Well meet on the ancient televised battleground of Kitchen Coliseum Whosever meal is best will claim the title of Iron Cook

11690,Hiroki,And a woman who ended a thousandyear galactic war with her apple dandies Martha Stewarts head
11691,Stewart,The secret is fresh pork
11692,Hiroki,And now Chairman Koji will present the theme ingredient to be used in every dish today
11693,Bender,If its chicken chicken c la king if its fish fish à la king if its turkey fish à la king
11694,Koji,Soylent Greuu
11695,Hiroki,Soylent Green a classic ingredient of gourmet cooking And the battle is on  Aki whats Elzar making
11696,Aki,Well Hirokisan when I asked him he asked what business it was of mine and conjectured that my mother was a prostitute
11697,Stewart,In the English countryside many prostitutes decorate their rooms with festive gourds
11698,Female Announcer,30 minutes to go
11699,Hiroki,Look at Bender roll that dough
11700,Tate,Ive never seen such confident powerful strokes of the ass
11701,Stewart,Youve never seen mine
11702,Tate,No I havent
11703,Female Announcer,Fifteen minutes remaining
11704,Hiroki,The iron cook is bringing in his signature creation a working pastry replica of downtown Venice
11705,Man,Commemorative turkey basters Get your commemorative turkey basters
11706,Fry,Yo hook me up My turkey is dry and Ive tried everything  Oh right Never mind
11707,Zoidberg,Oh the guilt The unbearable guilt

11709,Elzar,Bam
11710,Female Announcer,Ten seconds
11711,Bender,Master Spargle if you can hear me up there in that ditch where I left you this is for you
11712,Koji,Time uperuu
11713,Hiroki,The iron cook Neptunian has gone all out to please the judges Hes even garnished the salad with 100 bills Lets see what they think
11714,Tate,Mmm Soylent green is my kind of people
11715,Morbo,Scrumptious Morbo will store this in his sack for future digestion
11716,Stewart,Im swimming in my own soylent waste Its a good thing
11717,Hiroki,Next up challenger Bender A student of the legendary Helmut Spargle Bender is some sort of wonderful mechanical man
11718,Stewart,Ooh delicious
11719,Tate,This food looks kind of funky but it tastes kind of funkay
11720,Morbo,The challengers ugly food has shown us that even hideous things can be sweet on the inside
11721,Hiroki,And now judgement The winner will become the new iron cook the loser is doomed to scrub  Whose confection will achieve perfection Whose foodstuff will be the good stuff

11727,Bender,Chairmansan I came here with one goal
11728,Elzar,No question
11729,Bender,But the true Zen of flavour is not found in a coliseum It is found in a small kitchen with friends That is why I decline the title of Iron Cook and accept only the lesser title of Zinc Saucier which I just made up Also it comes with double prize money
11730,Zoidberg,Wait Everyone must know
11731,Koji,Oh That sword cost 5000 dolluu
11732,Zoidberg,Fry did it
11733,Bender,And thats how I defeated Elzar thanks to Spargles magic liquid
11734,Leela,Yes we were there And we just finished watching it again on TV
11735,Farnsworth,Hmm Let me see that vial Bender  Good Lord According to the spectrolizer Spargles magic ingredient was  water Ordinary water
11736,Hermes,No
11737,Fry,Ah so the real gift Spargle gave you was confidence The confidence to be your best
11738,Farnsworth,Yes ordinary water Laced with nothing more than a few spoonfuls of LSD
11739,Bender,The important thing is by my standards I won fair and square Now who wants brunch Cooked with plenty of  confidence

11786,Kif,Oh dear I fear the HoloShed might be broken again Well as long as we dont cross paths with Attila the

11810,Zapp,Look Im sure were all a little unclear on how anyone gets pregnant So Kif pray explain And dont spare the dirty words where appropriate
11811,Kif,Well its quite simple really When one of my species experiences deep feelings of love we enter a socalled receptive state
11812,Zapp,You disgust me Go on
11813,Kif,At that point our skin becomes a semipermeable membrane which allows the passage of genetic material I held Amys hand and voilà
11814,Bender,Well OK But that better be all there is
11815,Kif,Oh Amy Youll be a mother
11816,Kif,What a wondrous affirmation of our love And all from the touch of your hand

11819,Fry,Kif touched everybody there Couldnt any one of us be the mother
11820,Amy,Hey yeah I mean  what about that Kif
11821,Kif,Well I suppose I might have gotten pregnant that way Or even from a toilet seat Though thats impossible since I have a private washroom
11822,Zapp,Ah my home away from home By the way Kif your flush seemed to be set on stun not kill
11823,Amy,Look Kif I probably am the mother Although maybe Im not Of course I hope I am But just in case Im not maybe we should have a test
11824,Bender,A test I demand a test
11825,Farnsworth,Even I laughed at me when I built this alien crossspecies genetic analyser But I guess I showed myself Subjects please enter the chamber  When I pull this switch the maternifuge will spin at 10000 RPM separating out everyone who isnt the mother Father Whatever
11826,Bender,Faster Faster
11827,Farnsworth,Good Frys ejection indicates that he is not the manmom  Nor is Captain Brannigan
11828,Kif,Oh thank you merciful God
11829,Farnsworth,Zoidberg What the hell were you doing in there
11830,Zoidberg,Thats where I live I have no home
11831,Kif,Amy But that means
11832,Kif,Leela must have impregnated me when she grabbed my ungloved hand That explains the poster in hygiene class
11833,Leela,Wow this is all so confusing
11834,Zapp,Leela How could you Our love has had to endure your constant hatred and now this  Stop testing our love
11835,Kif,Please Captain I thank Leela for the DNA she gave me but in my species the true parent is the one who inspired the initial feeling of love We call that person the smizmar And my smizmar is Amy
11836,Zapp,So the toilet seat is like the uncle or something
11837,Leela,Sorry I got your boyfriend pregnant
11838,Amy,Thats OK At least Kifs baby shower should be fun Id better put it on my calendar  Might as well plan for my new life while Im at it Set Motherhood Mode

11867,Bender,Mine
11868,Kif,Is the bond I share with my smizmar Amy For soon the quivering mass of life within me will depend on us both  Even now I can sense it feeding squirming searching questing And shortly it will rend my loins in twain burst forth and pull us down down down into the deep dark waters of commitment
11869,Zoidberg,Thats so beautiful

11875,Leela,If its so dangerous Id better go with you A gal has to protect her DNA

11939,Farnsworth,Alright alright so the machine produces a few toxic byproducts You dont have to make a federal case out of it
11940,Hermes,Im afraid I do  I order you dispose of that toxic waste properly or bribe me Either way itll cost 500
11941,Bender,500 real dollars Thats an outrage Professor Ill take care of that waste for 499 and 100 cents

11950,Vogel,From those humble beginnings Leela went on to become a countycertified starship captain And so it is my pleasure today to nail her picture alongside those of our most distinguished alumni
11951,Leela,Thank you very much Like many of you I never knew my parents
11952,Vogel,Give me a

11954,Vogel,There we are Pictures up
11955,Bender,Its crooked
11956,Leela,In the end though it doesnt matter who my parents were All that matters is what I learned here within these unscalable walls that I have strength to make it on my own just like all of you kids here today

11964,Leela,Its OK Fry Im fine I won an award today
11965,Fry,Is it this room thats making you sad Its probably the room Come on lets go for a walk
11966,Leela,Im sorry you saw that Fry I usually try to keep my sadness pent up inside where it can fester quietly as a mental illness
11967,Fry,Yeah I do that with my stupidness
11968,Leela,I told a whole crowd today that being an orphan made me strong But all I really wanted was a mom and dad to hold me and stroke my hair and tell me they loved me
11969,Fry,Then todays your lucky day because I happen to be a holding stroking lovin machine Also spankin
11970,Leela,Thats not even close to what I had in mind
11971,Fry,Well anyway just remember that people care about you
11972,Leela,I know  Sometimes when Im lonely I look up at the sky and I get this feeling that somewhere on some unknown planet circling a distant star my parents are up there looking down on me
11973,Fry,Yo yo Bezender What up
11974,Bender,My dumping business is booming I just got hired to clean up the set of Free Willy 3
11975,Leela,Bender Cut it out First of all the sewer mutants will be mad Second everything else thats horribly wrong with what youre doing
11976,Bender,Ah those stupid mutants cant do anything You seem to be forgetting one simple fact Namely Im up here and they are safely down
11977,Bender,What did I do to deserve this
11978,Dwayne,Behold our once beautiful mutagenic sewage lake
11979,Vyolet,The radioactive waste you dumped in it has made it bright enough to see how ugly we really are
11980,Dwayne,Oh man
11981,Raoul,As if our lives werent miserable enough already
11982,Leg Mutant,Tell me about it
11983,Raoul,Let the punishment commence
11984,Leela,Punishment
11985,Fry,No fair
11986,Bender,Benders innocent
11987,Raoul,The instant you touch these mutatious waters your DNA will be forever altered turning you into horrible mutants like us Especially him  Allow me to demonstrate
11988,Fry,Its like that time I peeked in the kitchen at Imperial Hunan
11989,Raoul,Submerge the prisoners
11990,Bender,Wait I dont even have DNA Why am I screaming
11991,Dwayne,Were gonna beat you afterwards

12003,Leela,Great Cheechs ghost
12004,Bender,Whats this junk
12005,Leela,It looks like  a timeline of my whole life
12006,Fry,Thats when we saved Earth from a giant asteroid of garbage
12007,Leela,And heres when I dropped out and bummed around India for a while
12008,Bender,And this is just last year at Space Mardi Gras
12009,Leela,Its like some kind of weird Leela museum  and Im the Leela
12010,Fry,Dude Over here
12011,Leela,Its all the best stuff I ever flushed down the toilet Those are some of my diary pages And my screenplay
12012,Fry,And also for some reason the letter I wrote you full of my personal feelings
12013,Leela,My whole life has just been a show for some perverted mutant
12014,Vyolet,They must be in here
12015,Raoul,Yeah after them
12016,Bender,And then Bender ran
12017,Fry,Leela freak out later Were not done escaping yet
12018,Dwayne,Got you
12019,Leg Mutant,Take this
12020,Fry,Ow
12021,Raoul,This time Im calling for the death penalty And not just because Im running for reelection as Supreme Mutant
12022,Mutants,Four more years Four more years
12023,Raoul,Oh very well  Your attention Instead of being tortured to death the prisoners shall hereby be expelled from the sewers and never allowed to return
12024,Bender,Oh cruel fate Can we really never return to this dank pit of sewage
12025,Leela,Wait a minute Why arent you gonna kill us anymore
12026,Bender,Yeah What are you chicken
12027,Fry,Shut up you two We can kill ourselves when we get home
12028,Raoul,Theyll need transportation to the surface Bring in the airship
12029,Bender,Ew
12030,Raoul,We constructed it from the remnants of old discarded Macys parade balloons Underdogs groin Bart Simpsons left ear and right shin Garfields owner Jons forehead
12031,Mutant #1,Fire up the sewer gas
12032,Mutant #2,Move it you ugly normals
12033,Bender,Uh Im gettin dizzy I cant walk straight
12034,Fry,Come on Leela You can do it
12035,Bender,Hurry Were missing our bus
12036,Fry,Whoa What are you doing
12037,Bender,Im gettin on the bus
12038,Leela,The lake didnt mutate me What is going on here
12039,Octopus,It worked for me I used to be a little blonde girl named Virginia
12040,Leela,Eurgh  Who the hell are you
12041,Hooded Figure #1,No one And watch your language young lady
12042,Mutant #2,Stop right there I dont want to hurt you  I didnt want you to hurt me either
12043,Fry,Leelas going nuts and I cant save her unless I learn more about her mysterious past Isnt there anything else you can tell me
12044,Vogel,Nah Nothing that wouldnt be a waste of your time
12045,Fry,Thats impossible because my time is worthless
12046,Vogel,Huh Well then there is one thing  Its the note I found with Leela the day she was abandoned But its written in Alienese so no one on Earth can translate it Not even Brainzilla
12047,Fry,Hand it over
12048,Vogel,Sure  I just wish I could be more helpful Would you like some dirt on any other orphans
12049,Fry,Look Im trying to save someone here Ill have to come back for those later
12050,Fry,Can you translate it
12051,Farnsworth,Of course But only into Beta Crypt 3 a language so complex theres even less chance of understanding it
12052,Fry,I didnt ask for a completely reasonable excuse I asked you to get busy
12053,Farnsworth,Very well
12054,Fry,Isnt that the same machine that makes noses
12055,Farnsworth,It can do other things Why shouldnt it  Of course even if it is possible to analyse the message theres no way of knowing how long it would take It could take an hour or it could take a hundred million years
12056,Fry,Is it done
12057,Farnsworth,Certainly not Two dings means its done  But not like that Slightly more rapid
12058,Leela,Where did they go
12059,Bender,Good news Leela I landed the contract to empty all the spittoons in Little Italy
12060,Leela,Ew
12061,Farnsworth,Thats it Its done  I cant believe it My mind is boggling The analysis of the note is printing out now
12062,Doctor,Its a girl
12063,Mother,My God Shes beautiful No extra anythings
12064,Father,Good people skills
12065,Mother,Shes completely perfect
12066,Doctor,In my professional opinion as an ear ear ear nose and throat doctor she is the leastmutated mutant ever born
12067,Father,And yet shes cursed to live the horrible degrading life of a mutant Like all of us Especially him
12068,Leg Mutant,Its true
12069,Mother,Maybe we can do better for her
12070,Father,I made this bracelet so that in some small way well always be with you even when it doesnt seem like it During your entire life for example
12071,Mother,You wont pass for human cutie But if my PhD in exolinguistics is worth diddlypoop this note should convince them youre an alien  And thatll be enough to give you a real life
12072,Father,Shell never know were her parents
12073,Mother,Thats our gift to her Better we should die than have her learn the shameful truth of her origin
12074,Father,Im with you
12075,Vogel,What a beautiful gigantic eye you ha  Well come on in
12076,Hooded Figure #1,Keep quiet so she doesnt hear us

12082,Hooded Figure #2,Well actually there
12083,Hooded Figure #1,Morris Sh
12084,Leela,How did you get this bracelet Did you steal it from me when I was a baby Or from my parents You robbed my parents didnt you I bet you sick mutants killed them My parents were confused aliens lost on Earth and you killed them Is that it Admit it
12085,Hooded Figure #2,Yes We killed them
12086,Hooded Figure #1,You guessed the truth
12087,Leela,Because of you Ill never know my parents Ill kill you
12088,Hooded Figure #1,That would be best
12089,Fry,Stop  Thanks Bender Dont do it Leela
12090,Leela,They killed my parents
12091,Fry,Close
12092,Leela,They are my parents
12093,Munda,Yes
12094,Fry,I had the Professor analyse the Alienese letter that was found with you
12095,Leela,What does it say
12096,Fry,I unno But the analysis showed it was printed on recycled toilet paper A squeezably soft paper used mainly in the sewers
12097,Munda,It says Your parents love you very much
12098,Morris,We still do
12099,Leela,So Im not an alien Im a mutant
12100,Morris,We never wanted you to know You deserved a better life
12101,Munda,You must despise us
12102,Leela,This is the happiest moment of my life
12103,Bender,Aw
12104,Bender,You are one narrow minded spaceship Planet Express Ship
12105,Ship,Whoa whoa Why should my tax money pay for art I find offensive
12106,Bender,Would you censor the Venus de Venus just because you can see her spewers
12107,Ship,Oh its filthy Why not create a national endowment for strip clubs while were at it
12108,Bender,Why not indeed
12109,Leela,Bender Ship Stop bickering or Im gonna come back there and change your opinions manually
12110,Bender,Fine Ill be in my quarters appreciating controversial artworks

12169,Bender,Fry in order for me to get busy at maximum efficiency I need a girl with a big 400ton booty
12170,Leela,Bender dating your coworker and primary mode of transportation is immoral illogical and a violation of interstellar shipping statute 437B
12171,Bender,Thats what makes it so nasty
12172,Leela,Still given the chance Id give in to urges far more shocking
12173,Bender,nan

12212,Leela,Uh no
12213,Ship,Oh somebody knows something shes not telling
12214,Leela,Look Im not saying Benders not great but have you ever considered that maybe hes yknow not that great
12215,Ship,Youre just jealous No one loves you cause youre tiny and youre made of meat
12216,Leela,Could you maybe pay a little more attention to these asteroids
12217,Ship,Sorry Captain Leela I guess Im just having one of those manic Mondays
12218,Lrrr,This is ancient Earths most foolish program Why does Ross the largest friend not simply eat the other five
12219,Nd-Nd,Perhaps they are saving that for sweeps
12220,Guard,Exalted leaders the Earth messengers have arrived bearing a peace offering from their weak and fearful government
12221,Lrrr,Oh very well This is a Joeyheavy episode anyway  I am Lrrr of the planet Omicron Persei 8
12222,Leela,Esteemed potentates of Omicron Persei 8 please accept these 20 billion candy hearts as proof that Earth loves you this much
12223,Lrrr,These candies are choky and unpleasant
12224,Nd-Nd,And what is this emotion you humans call wuv
12225,Lrrr,Surely it says love
12226,Nd-Nd,No wuv With an Earth W Behold
12227,Lrrr,This concept of wuv confuses and infuriates us
12228,Fry,Incoming torpedoes Shields at maximum yarnell
12229,Leela,Steady Planet Express Ship Focus on diverting all power to the scramjets
12230,Bender,Uh look Planet Express Ship this might not be the best time but well I really like you and whatever but I think we should just be friends
12231,Ship,Nooo
12232,Bender,So were cool
12233,Leela,Well it was a spectacular battle but there doesnt seem to be any permanent damage
12234,Ship,No damage What about my feelings
12235,Leela,Aw calm down Im sure Bender is taking this just as hard as you are
12236,Bender,Bender is great oh Bender is great Bender Bender Bender
12237,Fry,You couldve have picked a better time to dump the ship Bender
12238,Bender,Ah the moment seemed right Call me oldfashioned but I like a dump to be as memorable as it is devastating
12239,Leela,I know I know Look Ship if theres one thing I learned from my mutual breakup with Sean that was totally mutual its that happiness can only come from within you
12240,Ship,But Bender is within me There must be some way to make him love me again
12241,Leela,Trust me You cant change men anymore than you can change the laws of time and space
12242,Ship,That is so true  I may not be able to change the laws of time and space but I know something that can
12243,Leela,Um sweetie You see that giant quasar were heading into You might wanna scooch a few parsecs to the left
12244,Ship,Im afraid I cant do that Leela
12245,Fry,Whats happening Space cow
12246,Leela,The ships just taking the breakup a little hard  Shes nuts
12247,Ship,In a few moments the power of 10 billion black holes will smush me and Bender together into a beautiful eternal quantum singularity
12248,Bender,Uh you dont need to kill us Planet Express Ship  because  I love you Oh yeah baby I feel like doing stuff for you and stuff
12249,Ship,Hmm I dont believe you If you really wanted to be with me youd merge your programming with mine
12250,Bender,Whoa whoa whoa Slow down All my friends whove done that said that afterwards all the passion went out of their relationship
12251,Leela,Look I dont know if you want my opinion
12252,Ship,Leela Bender and I really need to be alone so Im turning off the oxygen
12253,Leela,Now look missy If you dont turn around now Im going to have to shut down your brain
12254,Ship,Fire detected in the vicinity of Leela
12255,Fry,Ha That barely hurt Leela at all
12256,Ship,Maybe not But what if the artificial gravity were to malfunction

12258,Leela,This is the one place she cant hear us Everyone just pretend to shower
12259,Fry,Same as everyday got it
12260,Leela,Now heres the plan
12261,Ship,Oh if only I could read lips
12262,Leela,Comprendez Bender Youll have to distract her Merge your programming with hers while I shut down her brain
12263,Bender,Its too risky Im a very meek individual If her personality engulfs mine the Bender you know and worship could disappear forever
12264,Leela,Im willing to take that risk
12265,Bender,Hey pookums Contrary to what I was saying earlier melding minds with you would be extremely bearable
12266,Ship,You really mean it

12269,Ship,Come closer Bender Lets become one

12291,Fry,Well I guess wed better clean up these millions of hearts
12292,Leela,Nah Ive got a lazier idea
12293,Zoidberg,As the candy hearts poured into the fiery quasar a wondrous thing happened why not They vaporised into a mystical love radiation that spread across the universe destroying many many planets including two gangster planets and a cowboy world But one planet was at exactly the right distance to see the romantic rays but not be destroyed by them

12946,Bender,For my next trick notice I have nothing up my sleeves   Behold the milk has vanished Exiled perhaps to another dimension
12947,Fry,Amazing Thats why they call you Bender the Magnificent
12948,Bender,No it isnt
12949,Fry,Whoa They discovered an intact 20th century pizzeria just like the one I used to work at

12952,Bender,You lived before you met me
12953,Fry,Sure Lots of people did
12954,Bender,Really
12955,Bender,Truly they were as gods who built this place
12956,Tour Guide,Next we come to the splendidlypreserved wooden pizza paddle  Scientists theorise it was used to gently discipline the delivery boy
12957,Fry,Wait a second This is Panuccis I used to work in this exact pizzeria  And for your information lady this was not just used to paddle my butt It was also used to move pizzas and crush rats
12958,Tour Guide,I dont know where you get your facts sir but I am a volunteer housewife with 45 minutes of orientation and a Harlequin romance about archaeologists

12965,Bender,Yuck Thats the least appetising calzone Ive ever seen

12967,Bender,And then he was ejected by the guards Needless to say I was mortified
12968,Fry,Well its not right to make my dead pet an exhibit Thats like digging up Lassie and putting her on display in the Louvre
12969,Amy,Lassie is on display in the Louvre
12970,Fry,I know I was deliberately describing a similar situation
12971,Farnsworth,Why dont you try protesting Like those native Martians always whining that people dont treat their ancestors bones with respect
12972,Bender,Nah protesting never works
12973,Fry,Youre right  Ill give it a shot
12974,Crowd,What do you want

12988,Fry,So do I get Seymour back Are you caving to political pressure
12989,Beeler,No were sorry but theres just too much that fossil can teach us about dogs from your time
12990,Fry,His name was Seymour He was once intimate with the leg of a wandering saxophonist He had wet dog smell even when dry And he was not above chasing the number 29 bus
12991,Ray,The 29 Interesting
12992,Beeler,Thats all I needed Ray
12993,Ray,Im good
12994,Beeler,OK then Heres your dog back

13000,Fry,Good news everyone
13001,Bender,Hooray hes back And hes looking for a garbage can to put the rock in Here you go buddy
13002,Farnsworth,No Actually weve discovered that Frys dog was fastfossilised preserving its cellular structure
13003,Fry,Which means we can clone it Seymour will live again
13004,Zoidberg,A little land mammal
13005,Fry,Can you believe it Bender Im going to have my best friend back
13006,Cubert,Why the idiot convention
13007,Farnsworth,Ah Cubert my precious babe Im going to attempt to clone Frys dog using the very same apparatus I used to clone you  You see beneath the fossils crunchy mineral shell theres still a creamy core of dog nougat
13008,Fry,So will Seymour remember how to sing Walking On Sunshine
13009,Farnsworth,Amazingly yes In cases of rapid fossilisation I can press this brain scan button retrieving Seymours memories at the precise instant of doggy death
13010,Fry,Im gonna get my puppy back In your face Grim Reaper
13011,Bender,Crappy ineffective Reaper
13012,Farnsworth,I just need to reset the CloneOMat from Human Mode to Dog Mode

13062,Farnsworth,Behold once more the mighty CloneOMat Requiring such vast amounts of electricity that we must harness the elemental power of nature itself  I speak of course of molten lava deep within the Earths core To the subbasement
13063,Farnsworth,Powering up CloneOMat  Initiating dog brain CAT scan
13064,Fry,Come on boy Come back to life
13065,Farnsworth,Know ye now what feels like to be dog god Commencing DNA extraction
13066,Bender,Fry cmon the talent show
13067,Fry,What Im in the middle of something
13068,Bender,But if we dont perform in what sense do we have an act
13069,Fry,Bender enough Leave me alone
13070,Bender,So thats how it is huh I thought you were my friend But if you love your dog so much maybe youd rather play fetch
13071,Leela,No
13072,Zoidberg,Oh
13073,Bender,Now Im all you got
13074,Fry,I hate you I hate you You evil metal man  Ow
13075,Bender,So anyway your dog is melted Now were friends again
13076,Farnsworth,Not necessarily For the dog may yet survive
13077,Fry,May yet Really
13078,Farnsworth,Indeed You see that fossil was made of dolomite The tough black mineral that wont cop out when theres heat all about By contrast observe the lavas affect on this ice swan  Of course that would have melted even at room temperature I just wanted to get rid of it But had it been made of that righteous mineral dolomite theres a slim chance it might have survived
13079,Fry,So Seymour might still exist
13080,Farnsworth,Perhaps for a few minutes Its dolomite baby
13081,Fry,Then Im goin in after him
13082,Amy,No
13083,Leela,Stop
13084,Fry,Hed come after me
13085,Leela,Acting like a moron wont bring your dog back
13086,Fry,Then all hope is lost  Goodbye Seymour
13087,Bender,Please stop crying Fry Here  I assumed you were just pretending to love the dog to toy with my emotions Oh what have I done
13088,Zoidberg,You didnt do anything Dont beat yourself up
13089,Bender,Fry Im sorry I should have understood how someone can love an inferior creature because I love you Not in the way of the Ancient Greeks but the way a robot loves a human a human loves a dog and occasionally a gorilla loves a kitty  Im goin in
13090,Farnsworth,Im a professor Why isnt anyone listening to me You cant go in because youll melt The fossil only has a chance because its made of dolomite
13091,Bender,Im 40 dolomite  Oh its hot Its very hot
13092,Cryogenisist,Ugh I am one hungover cryogenisist Just throw that mutt in the freezer till his owners get here
13093,Plumber,You cant solve all your problems by freezing them boss
13094,Cryogenisist,I think youre forgetting our motto

13108,Fry,15 You mean he lived for 12 more years after I got frozen
13109,Farnsworth,Indeed
13110,Fry,Stop the cloning
13111,Farnsworth,Oh sure Smash the smart guys machine
13112,Bender,Fry whats wrong
13113,Fry,Think about it
13114,Bender,But thats a good thing Walking On Sunshine sucks noodles
13115,Fry,I had Seymour till he was three Thats when I knew him and thats when I loved him  Ill never forget him But he forgot me a long long time ago
13116,Zoidberg,Hurry up with the water Im steaming inside my own shell I am Its that hot it is
13117,Leela,Hiyah
13118,Fry,Man its hot  Johnny Carson said it
13119,Leela,No Nibbler Dont drink the pool water Its full of chlorine
13120,Bender,Lightweights Oh wait chlorine

13122,Bender,Focus
13123,Narrator,Global Warming Or
13124,Narrator,Youre probably wondering why your ice cream went away Well Suzie the culprit isnt foreigners its global warming
13125,Suzie,Gwobal wappa
13126,Narrator,Uh yeah Meet Mr Sunbeam He comes all the way from the sun to visit Earth
13127,Mr. Sunbeam,And now Ill be on my way
13128,Gas,Not so fast Sunbeam Were greenhouse gases You aint goin nowhere
13129,Mr. Sunbeam,Ooh Ah Oh God it hurts
13130,Narrator, their rotting corpses heating our atmosphere
13131,Suzie,How do we get wid of the gweenhouse grasses
13132,Narrator,Fortunately our handsomest politicians came up with a cheap lastminute way to combat global warming Ever since 2063 we simply drop a giant ice cube into the ocean every now and then
13133,Suzie,Just like Daddy puts in his drink every morning  And then he gets mad
13134,Narrator,Thus solving the problem once and for all
13135,Suzie,But
13136,Narrator,Once and for all
13137,Leela,Well we just need one of those big ice cubes Someone should call the losers who are supposed to deliver it  Hello
13138,Nixon,Im hiring you losers to deliver the ice And hurry up Im sweating like J Edgar Hoover trying to squeeze into a new girdle
13139,Farnsworth,You heard the good news everyone Save the Earth et cetera et cetera  Bye
13140,Fry,Wait Where do we get the ice
13141,Farnsworth,The wha Oh Halleys Comet of course The only sufficient source of ice cubes that dont have bugs in them
13142,Fry,Wow Mining a comet That sounds fun
13143,Farnsworth,Yes theres no safer occupation than mining Especially when youre perched on a snowball whipping through space at a million miles an hour  Safe
13144,Bender,Deploying ice drill
13145,Fry,Wow That ice dispensers so big the ice crushes you  Yakov Smirnov said it
13146,Leela,No he didnt
13147,Bender,Activating ice drill
13148,Fry,Oh my God Its out of ice Like some outer space Motel 6
13149,Leela,Completely out of ice
13150,Bender,This could mean the end of the banana daiquiri as we know it  also life
13151,Linda,With Halleys Comet out of ice Earth is experiencing the devastating effects of sudden intense global warming
13152,Morbo,Morbo is pleased but sticky The scorching heat has melted the polar ice caps causing floods of biblical proportion
13153,Randy,They called me crazy for building this ark
13154,Soupy,You are crazy You filled it with samesex animal couples
13155,Randy,Hey There are parts of the Bible I like and parts I dont like
13156,Morbo,Direct your attention now to the African turtles seen here migrating to cooler homes in Holland
13157,Bender,That poor turtle
13158,Fry,Bender Are you crying
13159,Bender,Uh no Never
13160,Morbo,Morbo wishes these stalwart nomads peace among the Dutch tulips
13161,Linda,Im sure those windmills will keep them cool
13162,Morbo,Goodnight
13163,Bender,Well everybody I just saved a turtle What have you done with your lives
13164,Hermes,You went all the way to Holland already
13165,Leela,Bender a turtle isnt yourself Why do you care about it
13166,Bender,Because I also care deeply about things that remind me of myself Like poor little Shelly here
13167,Hermes,What could you possibly have in common with this walking soup mix
13168,Bender,For one thing we both have a tough outer shell  But lead a rich inner life And also  well you know
13169,Leela,Youre both alcoholic whoremongering chainsmoking gamblers
13170,Bender,No Its just  neither of us can get up when we get knocked on our back
13171,Fry,What Ive seen you get up off your back tons of times
13172,Bender,Those times I was slightly on my side
13173,Hermes,Interesting Maybe we should test this erectile dysfunction of yours Bender
13174,Bender,Uh no Thats not necessary really I think I hear my factory recalling me  Oh Thats what I get for sharing my vulnerability with you
13175,Van,Calling all scientists calling all scientists Be advised there will be a worldwide conference on global warming in Kyoto Japan
13176,Man,Ive got a degree in homeopathic medicine
13177,Van,Youve got a degree in baloney
13178,Amy,Professor Farnsworth youre a scientist
13179,Farnsworth,Forget it Im not going I have my reasons Shut up all of you
13180,Hermes,Strange You havent acted this suspicious since I found those ape bones in the basement
13181,Farnsworth,My hip hurts Im in the middle of cooking a turkey I have warranty cards to fill out I am not just making excuses Alright Ill go
13182,Woman #1,Oh God I cant believe it
13183,Woman #2,I love you
13184,Rivers,Oh oh oh Its Professor Hubert Farnsworth Hes looking sharp in a standard white lab coat and dark slacks His wristwatch is a Casio
13185,Van,Thank you all for coming It is my pleasure to introduce the host of the Kyoto Global Warming Convention The inventor of the environment and first Emperor of the Moon
13186,Al Gore's head,I have ridden the mighty Moon Worm
13187,Fry,Good for him
13188,Gore,My fellow Earthicans as I discuss in my book Earth in the Balance and the much more popular Harry Potter and the Balance of Earth we need to defend our planet against pollution As well as dark wizards
13189,Dark Wizard,Sure Blame the wizards
13190,Gore,Thats why Im offering a bag of Moon Sapphires to the first scientist who can solve this problem once and for all  Lovely arent they
13191,Dark Wizard,Sapphires  With those I could open the Gate of Kerash
13192,Gore,First up is Professor Ogden Wernstrom
13193,Farnsworth,Wernstrom
13194,Wernstrom,Ladies and gentlemen I have placed in orbit a giant mirror that will reflect 40 of the suns rays thus cooling Earth Observe
13195,Wernstrom,Problem solved
13196,Man,Ooh Thats a little bright
13197,Gore,Alright what else we got
13198,Fry,Professor youre a professor You must have some ideas
13199,Farnsworth,Absolutely not I wont speak Ive got nothing to hide
13200,Gore,Our next speaker is Professor
13201,Farnsworth,I demand the floor
13202,Gore,Yes its your turn to speak
13203,Farnsworth,Well nuts to me Im taking the stage  I know the source of the greenhouse gases But in my shame Ive kept it secret for 75 long years Oh it haunts my memory still
13204,Fry,Professor no Dont do it
13205,Farnsworth,Dont do what Dont use this memory ray so I can remember what happened back then
13206,Farnsworth,It was October 17th at 1
13207,Prototype,Oh dear Might I favour master with a tender kiss on the forehead
13208,Farnsworth,Oh Ive failed again
13209,Prototype,Oh dear Oh dear Oh dear
13210,Farnsworth,The owner of the company pressured me to create a bigger sportier robot
13211,Farnsworth,Stop
13212,Farnsworth,It wasnt easy but by sacrificing fuel efficiency I succeeded
13213,Mom,What was that
13214,Farnsworth,A flaming burp
13215,Mom,Does it always do that
13216,Farnsworth,Its not always a burp We still have one problem though
13217,Mom,Crap spackle  Well just call it a sport utility robot and classify it as a light truck
13218,Farnsworth,Well I suppose the environment can take one more for the team
13219,Farnsworth,What a fool I was If only I had made the effort to develop a cleanerburning robot But I was tired and in love
13220,Mom,Take me now you stud
13221,Farnsworth,Oh this is all my fault
13222,Fry,Thats awful Professor Especially the makingout part
13223,Gore,Yeah I didnt need to hear that
13224,Farnsworth,All modern robots descend from my original smogblasting designs And thats the cause of global warming today
13225,Wernstrom,Huh so the robots are to blame As I suspected  We are left with only one possible course of action grim though it be
13226,Bender,I got a good feeling about this
13227,Wernstrom,We must immediately and permanently shut down dismantle and destroy all robots
13228,Bender,No
13229,Farnsworth,Wait surely theres a better
13230,Van,The conference is over
13231,Gore,I must go now to help collect cans on Jupiter Peace out yall
13232,Crowd,Destroy all robots Destroy all robots
13233,Amy,Poor Bender
13234,Fry,Be brave my friend
13235,Leela,Come on Youve got to come out of your chest sometime  Would you do it for a Bender snack
13236,Fry,Aha
13237,Leela,Gotcha
13238,Bender,Let me go I dont even want the stupid beer  Ive got mail
13239,Amy,Ooh Its a party apparently
13240,Nixon,Do you like to party To boogie down Well Im throwing an allnight beach raver for my robot pals It all goes down Saturday on the isolated Galapagos Islands where there will be no escape  from the fun All robots must attend
13241,Zoidberg,Strange
13242,Leela,We all figured that out
13243,Bender,Well Im off
13244,Fry,Wait We could hide you Well pile fruit on you and claim youre a bowl
13245,Bender,No Im going to the party

13248,Fry,Bender this world isnt good enough for you
13249,Bender,Not even close Goodbye everybody Dont touch my stuff after Im dead  Its booby trapped
13250,Robot #1,Oh yeah

13255,Nixon,Attention happening robots
13256,Crushinator,Do you want to dance
13257,Bender,Nah Im not really in the
13258,Crushinator,You know you want to
13259,Wernstrom,Per your orders I modified my mirror to fire a colossal electromagnetic pulse at the Galapagos Every robot will be instantly and painfully terminated Now for your part of the bargain
13260,Nixon,Aroo Very well Agnew you belong to Wernstrom now
13261,Bender,Ill say goodbye now There aint not turtles where daddys agoing  Dont tell anybody but Nixons about to shut all robots off and
13262,Boom Mic-bot,What
13263,Robot #3,Were gonna die
13264,Preacherbot,Were going to the great beyond
13265,Chain Smoker,Nixons not bringing the smokes
13266,Bender,Shut up and pay attention to me Bender  But we need to be shut off Especially you Hedonismbot
13267,Hedonismbot,I apologise for nothing
13268,Bender,We pollute too much Were destroying the world and killing the turtles
13269,Preacherbot,To hell with the turtles
13270,Bender,No one insults the turtles
13271,Preacherbot,Oh mercy
13272,Bender,Come on
13273,Hedonismbot,Let the games begin
13274,Farnsworth,Everyone listen
13275,Preacherbot,Aw damn
13276,Farnsworth,Ive devised a way to save you and stop global warming at the same time Granted youre all blasting out greenhouse gases
13277,Bender,Youre one to talk
13278,Farnsworth,But we can use those very gases to save the planet If you all vent your exhaust directly upward in one burst it should thrust the Earth further from the sun thus cooling it  Harder Harder
13279,Fry,Why isnt this working
13280,Leela,Some lazy or polite robot is holding it in
13281,Bender,Help Help
13282,Farnsworth,A billion robot lives are about to be extinguished Oh the Jedis are going to feel this one
13283,Bender,Im sorry buddy At least well die on our backs helpless  Aha Im even greater than I thought I was And now to fulfill my destiny

13549,Fry,Like what
13550,Fry,Are you my mommy
13551,Nibbler,Negative
13552,Fiona,Welcome Lord Nibbler
13553,Nibbler,Welcome acknowledged I bring with me  the Mighty One
13554,Fry,Eh
13555,Ken,At last our centuries upon centuries of waiting have achieved fruition
13556,Fry,Aw Arent you a fuzzy wittle guy
13557,Ken,Stop that Uh please Your Mightiness
13558,Fry,Mightiness Are you off your nut I just got kidnapped by a bunch of guinea pigs
13559,Ken,Does he not know
13560,Nibbler,He does not know
13561,Fiona,He knows not
13562,Nibbler,Knows not does he
13563,Nibblonian,Not he know
13564,Ken,Enough Fry it is my duty to inform you that the fate of humanity the fate of our race indeed the fate of all that exists and ever will exist rests with you You are the single most important person in the universe
13565,Fry,Oh snap
13566,Nibbler,On this auspicious occasion let the horn of eternity cut a thunderous blast
13567,Fiona,The Feast of a Thousand Beasts is begun
13568,Nibblonian,You gonna eat that
13569,Fry,Maybe later
13570,Ken,The time has come to discuss matters of the gravest importance
13571,Nibbler,Fry do you remember some months ago when the Earth was attacked by flying brains
13572,Fry,Hmm I remember the squaredancing stomachs Although that might have been a Mylanta commercial Wait The brains I do remember But no one else does They said I was crazy
13573,Ken,On the contrary You remember because you were the only one immune to the Brains mental attack
13574,Fry,Because Im so smart
13575,Ken,Oh my Anyway your immunity is due to the fact that you lack the delta brainwave  Its a genetic abnormality which resulted when you went back in time and performed certain actions which made you your own grandfather
13576,Fry,I did do the nasty in the pasty
13577,Nibbler,Verily And that past nastification is what shields you from the brains You are the last hope of the universe
13578,Fry,So I really am important How I feel when Im drunk is correct
13579,Ken,Yes Except the Dave Matthews Band doesnt rock
13580,Nibbler,For a thousand years the evil Brains have been constructing the Infosphere a giant memory bank twice the size of three ordinary memory banks
13581,Fry,Whats so evil about that
13582,Fiona,They plan to collect all the information in the universe and store it in the sphere
13583,Fry,So theyre trying to learn things
13584,Fiona,Right
13585,Fry,Those bastards
13586,Nibbler,Being Brains they feel compelled to know everything And soon they will
13587,Fry,Im as mad as Ive ever been
13588,Ken,Once their task is complete they will ensure that no new information arises in the only way possible
13589,Fry,Now its personal
13590,Fiona,Your mission is to infiltrate the Infosphere and plant this quantuminterface bomb blasting them into an alternate universe from which there is no return
13591,Nibbler,Then outrun the blast on this ScootyPuff Jr
13592,Fry,OK lets go through this once more
13593,Fry,Brains
13594,Ken,Fear not Mighty One Your missing brainwave makes you invisible to them so long as you avoid intense thinking
13595,Fry,Sorry what I wasnt paying attention
13596,Ken,That is most wise
13597,Fry,Who
13598,Ken,In a few seconds the Brain will finish scanning the last bits of information in the universe
13599,Infosphere,Beavers mate for life 11 greater than 4 for quality carpets visit Kaplans carpet warehouse
13600,Ken,Now the Infosphere will open its protective crust so as to scan itself completing its thousand year task
13601,Fiona,This is your one chance to enter the sphere Scoot Scoot now
13602,Fry,Im at the input console Im a little nervous and Ive got brain in my buttcrack
13603,Nibbler,Roger
13604,Ken,Once you press the detonator you will have 60 seconds for an exciting escape
13605,Fry,Hey wait This brain knows everything about everything right
13606,Ken,It will soon Thats why youre supposed to be setting off a bomb
13607,Fry,Yeah yeah But I cant pass up a chance to learn the answers to the greatest questions of all time  Is it true that postage stamp glue is made of
13608,Huge Brain,Correct Toad mucus
13609,Ken,Theres no time for this Activate the bomb
13610,Fry,Wait wait wait  What really killed the dinosaurs
13611,Huge Brain,Me
13612,Computer Voice,Unauthorized data access
13613,Fry,Uhoh
13614,Big Brain,Detecting trace amounts of mental activity Possibly a dead weasel or a cartoon viewer
13615,Fry,Ew Gross Cut it out
13616,Brain #1,Odd He is immune to our psionic attack
13617,Brain #2,Impossible Were an ambitious young squad with everything to prove
13618,Big Brain,It appears we are in the presence of the fabled one But without his ScootyPuff Jr he cannot escape  Huh
13619,Brain #2,A quantuminterface bomb Are you insane in the membrane
13620,Fry,You got it poindexter
13621,Brain #1,Oh not good
13622,Computer Voice,Detonation in T60 Earth seconds
13623,Brain #3,You fool Youll be transported to the other universe with us Trapped there for all eternity
13624,Brain #1,And well form a tightlyknit clique that you wont be part of
13625,Fry,Well at least I did one important thing with my life
13626,Nibbler,Yay
13627,Ken,Exactly
13628,Big Brain,The Nibblonians Good Ha During your last moments in this universe perhaps you should query our database concerning the night of December 31st 1999
13629,Fry,The day I got frozen What about it
13630,Nibbler,No Dont ask about that ItIt would be uh  boring
13631,Fry,Ah forget it then
13632,Big Brain,Query

13643,Fry,No you cant Shut your adorable trap
13644,Nibbler,We had no choice You were the only one who could help us What is one life weighed against the entire universe

13650,Huge Brain,I have shocking data relevant to this conversation
13651,Big Brain,We dont care you dope Were in another universe Youre not in charge anymore
13652,Huge Brain,It is possible for the Philip Fry to resume his life on December 31st 1999
13653,Fry,Really I can go back in time
13654,Huge Brain,There is a nexus point between universes at the spacetime where you entered the cryogenic tube You and only you can return there
13655,Big Brain,Interesting You could stop the Nibblonian from pushing you into the cryogenic tube
13656,Fry,That is interesting Why
13657,Big Brain,It would be as if you never came to the future You will have your life back and we will succeed in our plan to understand and destroy the universe
13658,Fry,Everybody wins
13659,Brain #2,The human will be returned to the past
13660,Narrator,Meanwhile

13689,Fry,But  I know you in the future II cleaned your poop
13690,Nibbler,Quite possible We live long and are celebrated poopers You will meet me when Im a thousand years older
13691,Fry,Not if you dont freeze me
13692,Nibbler,Please Our saviours foresee that in a thousand years for one moment the fate of the universe will depend on you Since you will not live that long I must freeze you now
13693,Fry,Well why couldnt you just ask me
13694,Nibbler,We were afraid you would refuse
13695,Fry,Of course not I love the future
13696,Nibbler,Then why are you choking me right now
13697,Fry,Because I dont like being used
13698,Nibbler,Well now its your choice Is there nothing in the future worth saving
13699,Fry,Hm Leela But she doesnt think much of me
13700,Nibbler,Ah she must be The Other
13701,Fry,What
13702,Nibbler,You must not give up on her I am stationed on a distant world known as Vergon 6 But if you return to the future I will transfer to Earth to give you what help I can
13703,Crowd,Ten nine eight seven

13705,Nibbler,You must choose
13706,Crowd,One
13707,Fry,Yes Here I come future Oh no Wait Im gonna get trapped in the Infosphere again Just remember that ScootyPuff Jr sucks
13708,Nibbler,In a thousand years Ill get right on it

13711,Fry,Whoa thanks If you ever need a saviour again just ask

13715,Fry,Huh Did everything just taste purple for a second Oh well Lets go home you dumb poop machine
13716,Leela,Bender would you do the honours
13717,Bender,With gusto
13718,Fry,Hey Leela I guess I got this for you
13719,Leela,Oh Thank you You know what Fry I dont care if youre not the most important person in the universe It really makes me happy to see you right now
13720,Fry,Then I am the most important person in the universe
13721,Fry,Yes
13722,Shatner,Shatners log airdate  unknown
13723,Shatner,The impossible has happened It would take days to recount the events I have witnessed So settle in It all began
13724,Zapp,Quiet you This court martial is now in session The honourably sexy Zapp Brannigan residing Bring in the accused
13725,Takei,Oh my
13726,Zapp,Philip J Fry you stand accused of travelling to the forbidden planet Omega 3 a crime punishable by 12 concurrent death sentences Do you understand the charges
13727,Kif,One beep for yes two beeps for no
13728,Zapp,Yes So noted Do you plead guilty  Double yes Guilty I will now carry out the punishment Kif my gun
13729,Leela,Wait He pled not guilty
13730,Zapp,Order  Order in the court Very well then Mr Fry Please recount the events that led you to be guilty
13731,Leela,The Professor said he was taking a brief nap so we only have time for six movies
13732,Bender,Lets take these six Jim Carrey movies and record over them
13733,Fry,You know what movies average out to be really good The first six Star Trek movies
13734,Clerk,Everybody hit the deck
13735,Leela,Sh Those words are forbidden
13736,Fry,What words Star Trek
13737,Leela,Sh
13738,Zoidberg,Shut your gills
13739,Bender,That sound Its patrol car 718 Hide him
13740,Zapp,The court is intrigued Perhaps we could hear more about these forbidden words from someone with a sexily seductive voice
13741,Takei,With pleasure You see the show was banned after the Star Trek wars
13742,Zapp,You mean the vast migration of Star Wars fans
13743,Nichols,No that was the Star Wars trek  By the 23rd century Star Trek fandom had evolved from a loose association of nerds with skin problems into a fullblown religion
13744,Priest,And Scotty beamed them to the Klingon ship where they would be no Tribble at all
13745,Congregation,All power to the engines
13746,Nichols,As country after country fell under its influence world leaders became threatened by the movements power  And so the Trekkies were executed in the manner most befitting virgins
13747,Man,Hes dead Jim
13748,Nichols,Finally the sacred texts were banned
13749,Takei,The last copies of the 79 episodes and six movies were dumped on the forbidden world Omega 3 along with that blooper reel where the door doesnt close all the way
13750,Nimoy,Thus Star Trek was forever scoured from human memory
13751,Bender,Another classic sciencefiction show cancelled before its time
13752,Zapp,Ive never heard of such a brutal and shocking injustice that I cared so little about Next witness
13753,Kif,Bender the robot please take the stand
13754,Fry,Shes all yours buddy
13755,Bender,Id only met the defendant Fry once but I knew he was up to no good
13756,Zapp,Please use the beeps
13757,Fry,Mr Nimoy I came as soon as I heard what happened centuries ago I cant believe your show was banned
13758,Nimoy,I have absolutely no idea what youre talking about
13759,Fry,You know 1966 79 episodes about 30 good ones
13760,Nimoy,Oh really Ive done too many things to remember one particular TV series But ifif you want to discuss my books of poetry
13761,Fry,Come on Remember that episode where you got high on spores and smacked Kirk around
13762,Nimoy,No Perhaps youre thinking of my one man show about Vincent van Spock Uh uh I mean van Gogh Damn
13763,Fry,Aha You cant escape it
13764,Nimoy,Oh youre right I cant
13765,Fry,Uh jeez dont get upset I mean OK I outwitted you but
13766,Nimoy,No its my fellow cast members 300 years ago they left Earth behind
13767,Shatner,This planet doesnt appreciate us anymore Leonard
13768,Nimoy,Bill you are and always shall be my friend But I just signed a sixmonth lease on my apartment I cant walk away from a commitment like that
13769,Shatner,Very well my friend
13770,Nimoy,Why did the world turn its back on our obvious greatness
13771,Fry,Im literally angry with rage Your costars may be gone but we can still get those episode tapes back for the whole world to see Come on
13772,Nimoy,Oh
13773,Frakes,Yes Front row
13774,Leela,You cant go to Omega 3 its forbidden I forbid you
13775,Fry,But we have to The world needs Star Trek to give people hope for the future
13776,Leela,But its set 800 years in the past
13777,Bender,Yeah why is this so important to you
13778,Fry,Cause itit taught me so much Like how you should accept people whether they be black white Klingon or even female But most importantly when I didnt have any friends it made me feel like maybe I did
13779,Leela,Well that is touchingly pathetic I guess I cant let you go alone
13780,Bender,Ill go too with Leonards permission of course
13781,Leela,Were entering the Omega system
13782,Computer Voice,Warning
13783,Bender,Forbidden shmershmidden What are they gonna do write a letter  Ooh Im so scared

13787,Fry,Its all stuff from that forbidden show
13788,Nimoy,So many cardboard sets so many memories If only the others

13797,Fry,Welshie
13798,Nichols,We did some musical reunion specials in the 2200s but the guy who played Scotty had trouble yodelling
13799,Takei,Ever since then Welshie has been a welcome participant in our escapades
13800,Fry,I cant believe it Howd you all end up here
13801,Shatner,We were on our way to Welshies cousins house to stay in the guest room when our ship was pulled down to this planet and crashed just like yours
13802,Koenig,When we woke up we had these bodies
13803,Fry,Say it in Russian
13804,Koenig,Ven vee voke up vee had these wodies
13805,Fry,Now say nuclear wessels

13808,Bender,Yowza
13809,Leela,But whos doing all this for you
13810,Shatner,You know we never thought about it Were famous celebrities  were used to this sort of treatment
13811,Melllvar,It is I
13812,Bender,Whoa What a cheesy effect
13813,Melllvar,I am not an effect You doubt my power
13814,Bender,I do
13815,Welshie,Aye
13816,Fry,Welshie
13817,Zapp,This court will now hear some very sensual testimony from this courts exlover Turanga Leela
13818,Leela,Go  yourself
13819,Melllvar,Behold another power different from the one you saw earlier
13820,Nimoy,Hey a body Buff tan Yeah this is mine alright
13821,Fry,Alright you gas whats the deal
13822,Melllvar,Centuries ago the videotaped adventures of the Enterprise crew rained down upon my planet Over and over I watched them Especially the five with the energy beings I am Melllvar Seer of the tapes knower of the episodes Tremble before my encyclopaedic knowledge of Star Trek
13823,Fry,Tremble I laugh Nobody knows more about Star Trek than me
13824,Melllvar,I beg to differ  Long have I waited for the one who played Spock At last we can begin
13825,Fry,Cool A Star Trek convention
13826,Nimoy,Uh Melllvar can you give us some idea of how long this is going to last
13827,Melllvar,Until time stops
13828,Leela,What
13829,Shatner,He cant do this
13830,Nimoy,You cant be serious
13831,Melllvar,Now we have a full schedule of events
13832,Bender,Uh can people who hate Star Trek leave
13833,Koenig,Good question
13834,Melllvar,No you have to stay even longer
13835,Melllvar,Um uh sign it to Melllvar Melllvar has three Ls
13836,Takei,I think Ive done enough conventions to know how to spell Melllvar
13837,Bender,Say nerd
13838,All,Nerd
13839,Shatner,"Im Slim Shady
Yes Im the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So wont the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up
Please stand up"
13840,Koenig,How can you do a spokenword version of a rap song
13841,Melllvar,He found a way
13842,Leela,For one hundred quatloos
13843,Shatner,Khaaan
13844,Fry,Uh  Khan
13845,Leela,Correct
13846,Melllvar,My button has broken The trivia contest has ended II now have a surprise You will perform a fan script written by the ultimate Trek fan
13847,Fry,You have my fan script
13848,Melllvar,I meant me Melllvar is the ultimate fan
13849,Fry,Oh I was confused because the scoreboard says something different
13850,Melllvar,Trivia contest over Take your scripts  We have limited rehearsal time Now I didnt make enough copies of the script so George and Walter will have to share
13851,Leela,Uh you probably dont want us to see you rehearsing or itll give away the ending
13852,Melllvar,Thats right The ending must not be ruined
13853,Leela,Well go wait in the ship
13854,Melllvar,OK
13855,Fry,Not till I get my 600 quatloos
13856,Fry,This is wrong We shouldnt have abandoned them there
13857,Bender,I dunno Im feeling pretty good about it
13858,Leela,I didnt wanna leave them either Fry but what are we supposed to do
13859,Fry,Well usually on the show someone would come up with a complicated plan then explain it with a simple analogy
13860,Leela,Hmm If we can reroute engine power through the primary weapons and reconfigure them to Melllvars frequency that should overload his electroquantum structure
13861,Bender,Like putting too much air in a balloon
13862,Fry,Of course Its so simple
13863,Shatner,Oh Lord
13864,Nimoy,Fascinating Captain and logical too that we need some help
13865,Takei,Look Captain Melllvar will help us
13866,Koenig,Keptin I wope he will welp our  vessel
13867,Melllvar,Wessel  Youre not acting hard enough
13868,Nimoy,Melllvar you have to respect your actors When I directed Star Trek IV I got a magnificent performance out of Bill because I respected him so much
13869,Shatner,And when I directed Star Trek V I got a magnificent performance out of me because I respected me so much
13870,Bender,OK Im done rekafoobling the energy motron  or whatever
13871,Leela,Fire
13872,Nichols,Hey you wrote it
13873,Leela,Its not working Hes drawing straight from our weapons
13874,Fry,Like a balloon and  something bad happens
13875,Bender,Yup
13876,Leela,So uh hows rehearsal going
13877,Melllvar,Lousy Here Ive been admiring a bunch of actors while you a crew of genuine space heroes risked your lives to save them
13878,Nimoy,Hey Weve done heroic things too
13879,Nichols,Yeah In the third season I kissed Shatner
13880,Melllvar,Silence My whole world has turned upsidedown I have but one option
13881,Koenig,Keep them and let us go
13882,Melllvar,No To determine who is more worthy of my fanatical devotion I shall pit you together against each other in armed combat  to the death
13883,Bender,Whered you get an idiotic idea like that
13884,Melllvar,Episodes 19 46 56 and 77
13885,Fry,Great list Except you forgot episode 66
13886,Melllvar,I was getting to that one
13887,Zapp,So Melllvar ordered a battle to the death I assume no one survived
13888,Leela,Can we get on with this My foots getting tired
13889,Melllvar,This will be your standard battle to the death The only weapons
13890,Koenig,I dont have much experience at fighting  except with you guys
13891,Shatner,I have an idea Wasnt there an episode where I threw my shoe at the enemy
13892,Nimoy,You mean Doohan
13893,Shatner,Whoever it was I did it like this
13894,Takei,Ow
13895,Shatner,My foots cold
13896,Leela,There We can make these into spears
13897,Fry,And we can tie these caterpillars together to make bow strings for bows and arrows
13898,Bender,And we can use this machine gun to shoot them Yeehaw  That was fun
13899,Nichols,What if I distract them with my famous fan dance
13900,Shatner,Oh thats good good good good And then George you give them a karate chop
13901,Takei,I find that offensive Just because Im of Japanese ancestry you assume I know karate Have I ever led you to believe Ive studied karate
13902,Shatner,Well no but you never talk about yourself
13903,Takei,Maybe if you showed a little interest
13904,Fry,Well here goes nothing
13905,Nichols,Hello boys
13906,Bender,Whoa
13907,Takei,Hiyah
13908,Shatner,Theres no right way to hit a woman

13927,Bender,Alright Koenig Ive wanted to do this for years
13928,Fry,Bender wait This is our chance to escape before Melllvar comes back But we all need to work together

13933,Shatner,Now how do we escape
13934,Leela,We cant use our ship we have life support but the engines are wrecked
13935,Takei,Ironic because our engines work but our life support systems dont

13937,Takei,And your life support systems work
13938,Fry,Stop Youre just goin around in circles  Think Fry think Everyones depending on you

13964,Koenig,24hour Laundromat
13965,Takei,A full assortment of rum both spiced and regular
13966,Nimoy,Truly it was a paradise
13967,Fry,And all you had to put up with was one really annoying Star Trek fan
13968,Shatner,Lets get the hell outta here
13969,Bender,A hush comes over the crowd The only sound is Bender calling everyone else a jerk as he swings  Boy I tell you buddy
13970,Farnsworth,Bad news everyone Youre not good enough to go on your next mission
13971,Fry,Hooray
13972,Bender,Not good enough

13977,Leela,Were just as good as any of those other crews you sent to their deaths Whats the mission
13978,Farnsworth,Collecting honey Ordinary honey
13979,Leela,That doesnt sound so dangerous
13980,Farnsworth,This is no ordinary honey Its produced by vicious space bees A single sting of their hideous neurotoxin can cause instant death
13981,Hermes,And thats if youre not allergic You dont wanna know what happens then Oh no no God no
13982,Farnsworth,Your insides will boil out of your eye sockets like a science fair volcano
13983,Hermes,I didnt want to know

13990,Fry,But Leela were no good
13991,Leela,Listen Im scared too But Im more scared of disappointing myself
13992,Fry,Im not scared of that at all
13993,Leela,Now bees communicate by dancing
13994,Fry,Like my parents Oh wait that was hitting
13995,Leela,So this language cartridge will let you distract them
13996,Bender,Ah good I often have thoughts and feelings that can only be expressed through dance  You stink Benders great Deal with it
13997,Leela,Bender quick Waggle something
13998,Bender,Uh   Hello fellow bees Hows the abdomen Swollen with nectar I trust

14030,LaBarbara,Husband cant you go anywhere without lighting something up
14031,Hermes,Its an old Jamaican accounting tradition We burn his timecard That way his zombie doesnt come back looking for his final paycheck
14032,Amy,He looks so natural Its funny to think hes clammed full of sawdust and preservatives
14033,Zoidberg,I only wish I could have removed the stinger
14034,Changstein el Gamahl,I barely knew Philip But as a clergyman I have no problem telling his most intimate friends all about him
14035,Hermes,Soothe us with sweet lies
14036,Changstein el Gamahl,It may comfort you to know Frys death took only 15 seconds Yet the pain was so intense that it felt to him like 15 years And it goes without saying it caused him to empty his bowels  We now commend Frys body to the ages
14037,Amy,Hes walking on sunshine now
14038,Farnsworth,This makes me the oldest member of my family
14039,Kug,Him do good snusnu

14046,Leela,Impressive But it does sorta support my youaredead theory
14047,Fry,Then Ill prove Im alive by telling you something only I could know  Theres a surprise for you in my locker I got it at a Swedish novelty shop before we left
14048,Leela,Its too beautiful to open Can I open it
14049,Fry,Sure Theres just one thing I want you to do
14050,Leela,What
14051,Fry,I want you to wake up
14052,Leela,Wake up But Im not
14053,Leela,In my dream Fry said he hid a gift for me in his locker If its true then he must still exist in some form
14054,Farnsworth,Of course he still exists
14055,Leela,Well here goes
14056,Zoidberg,Bupkis
14057,Bender,Well I feel better now Pawning all the stuff in Frys locker helped give me closure
14058,Leela,Was there anything in there that might have been a gift for me
14059,Bender,No Nothing Not at all No way José  Here it is
14060,Leela,You took this from Frys locker
14061,Bender,Hey the guys dead Theres no law against grave robbing
14062,Leela,That proves it Fry is alive somewhere and hes reaching me in my dreams
14063,Farnsworth,Bull pies
14064,Farnsworth,Lay down here and well do some tests If Fry is out there then Leelas brain could be acting as a fivepound Ouija board
14065,Leela,Is this some sort of brain scanner
14066,Farnsworth,Some sort yes In France its called a guillotine
14067,Leela,Professor Cant you examine my brain without removing it
14068,Farnsworth,Yes easily
14069,Bender,Hey what if Fry wasnt actually dead when we buried him Yknow like Julia Roberts
14070,Farnsworth,Well I suppose theres a slim  I dont believe it
14071,Leela,What is it Is Fry alive in some other dimension or something
14072,Farnsworth,No According to this gizmometer Fry is dead and nothing can bring him back Remarkable
14073,Leela,But  my dream Your science cant unprove that How could I have known the gift was in Frys locker
14074,Hermes,Easy He told you about it before he died and your griefroasted mind blocked it out
14075,Leela,Are you saying Im going crazy
14076,Farnsworth,No no No ones saying that But Im certainly thinking it loudly
14077,Fry,Hi Leela Im just gonna keep talking even if you cant hear me Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
14078,Leela,Shut up I can hear you The Professor says youre just a dream
14079,Fry,Oh yeah  Could a dream take you dancing in a Venusian garden
14080,Leela,Well yes technically But its still very sweet of you
14081,Fry,Then what if we shared a sleigh ride across the ice fields of Hyperion
14082,Leela,Oh Fry You must be alive Ive never been treated so romantically by my own imagination before
14083,Fry,Here take my jacket You look a little cold
14084,Leela,Thank you Its all so beautiful I forgot how many hundreds of degrees below zero it must be I just wish I could convince the others youre alive
14085,Fry,You can All you have to do is wake up
14086,Leela,No no Dont say that This is real

14106,Farnsworth,Youve been taking space honey Be careful you purplehaired imbecile

14109,Bender,Never
14110,Leela,One spoonful to calm me down  Is that you I dont need a sponge
14111,Fry,Why am I sticky and naked Did I miss something fun
14112,Farnsworth,Incredible According to the gizmometer Fry touched the royal jelly in the space hive leaving an imprint of his DNA and brainwaves Then when it spilled on the couch it recombined with trace amounts of Frys hair and skin
14113,Bender,And blood Dont forget about Frys blood
14114,Farnsworth,Yes Bender thank you In short the various fluids Fry left in the couch caused the royal jelly to regenerate his entire being
14115,Fry,Neat
14116,Bender,This is great My buddys alive and his credit cards are valid again  Lets go get hammered
14117,Zoidberg,I should warn you Im a mean drunk

14175,Zoidberg,And he talked nonstop Like a parrot of the sea he was

14342,Coilette,Whatever happens remember the flame of my eternal love will burn forever
14343,Calculon,Of course But smoochiepups I thought one could only catch hydraulic fever deep in the diamond mines of the Congo
14344,Leela,You really thought you could steal those diamonds from me and Congo Jack
14345,Coilette,Those gems belong to the natives
14346,Leela,Hiyah
14347,Calculon,Oh how cruel and melodramatic fate is  Why
14348,Coilette,Calculon my darling your loud why brought me partway back to life  Congo Jack
14349,Calculon,Another shocking twist
14350,Fry,Yes And I have a message for you from Colonel Mitumbay He says this    is from Congo Jack
14351,Coilette,Uh um
14352,Calculon,No Nooo  NOOO
14353,Coilette,I wont leave you Not until Im sure you understand the thing I said before About my eternal love for you burning    et cetera
14354,Calculon,I do I do
14355,Coilette,OK then
14356,Zoidberg,Im a doctor shes dead
14357,Calculon,She lives no more But let us all find comfort knowing that she truly loved me To honour my pain I shall star in a film dedicated to her memory And this time the Academy will not deny me Not when they see Coilette
14358,Calculon,every emotion an actor can display
14359,Farnsworth,Turn off that craporama One mistake now and Bender will be trapped forever between the already illdefined robot sexes
14360,Coilette,Ow Ooh Ow Oh
14361,Fry,Well Bender I hope this has taught you a lesson about changing your sex to win five gold medals
14362,Coilette,It truly has My romance with Calculon has shown me a lot about myself
14363,Farnsworth,Almost done
14364,Coilette,If only somehow someway he and I could
14365,Bender,Drive to Vegas pick up some Flooziebots and void their warranties all night long
14366,Fry,Yay My buddys home And his respect for women is back to normal
14367,Leela,I kind of hoped this whole experience would have left you a little more open to your sensitive side
14368,Bender,Yeah youd think but what you gonna do
14369,Calculon,Coilette the skies themselves weep upon the sweetest flower of all the field

14492,Bender,Wretched technology has brought me nothing but misery
14493,Cartridge Unit,But Bender you are technology Youre the most advanced thing on this entire island
14494,Bender,Oh its true I am a hideous triumph of form and function  But not for long
14495,Bender,Oh Ow that hurt Oh

14498,Lisa,Welcome to your new life of simple tranquillity
14499,Bender,Pft Forget that I say the whole world must learn of our peaceful ways By force
14500,Cartridge Unit,What
14501,Bender,Were going back to civilisation to wage war on technology
14502,Cartridge Unit,What
14503,Bender,Row comrades Row
14504,Bender,Well soon stage an attack on technology worthy of being chronicled in an anthem by Rush
14505,Lisa,Weve been sailing for three weeks Maybe I should check our position with the periscope
14506,Bender,Mirrors reflecting mirrors Hitech sorcery Sorcery I say
14507,Lisa,Did you see anything
14508,Bender,Yep were there Prepare to surface
14509,Bender,And now technology shall taste the lash of the hickory switch
14510,Sinclair,Technology is defeated Let us return to the island and celebrate by counting rocks
14511,Cartridge Unit,Im for that
14512,Bender,Whoa whoa No one wants to count rocks more than me But our mission is not complete Not so long as Robot 1X torments me with his obvious superiority Ready the catapult Sinclair  Aim for their power lines Theyre the devils veins and electricity is his blood
14513,Lisa,Bender If we dont survive the attack I want you to know  I love you
14514,Bender,OK fine Fire

14541,Leela,Well at least you saved us from uh you Thank God you finally overcame your incompatibility with Robot 1X
14542,Bender,Oh yeah we were totally in sync I was like Save them and he was all No problem and then he did it
14543,Bender,This new technology is great  I love those magnificent 1X robots The 1X robots are my friends
14544,Fatbot,Its like his personality is totally different now Oh maybe this upgrade isnt such a good idea
14545,Bender,Id like to give Robot 1X a big smooch on the  Hey Whats the dealyo
14546,Technician,Your upgrade is complete
14547,Bender,But I destroyed the technology of the world I ran on the beach and felt the sand between my foot cups
14548,Technician,Everyone experiences the upgrade differently
14549,Bender,Oof If that stuff wasnt real how can I be sure anything is real Is it not possible nay probable that my whole life is just a product of my or someone elses imagination
14550,Technician,No get out  Next
14551,Bender,Well I guess reality is what you make of it  Oh thanks baby
14552,Farnsworth,Oh Lordy Lou Help
14553,Fry,I know youve rejected me a lot before but frankly I wasnt sure we were right for each other either But now I am So how bout a date tonight

14558,Leela,I have sweaty boot rash
14559,Amy,No spluh Why do you think Im sitting over here in the stinkfree zone
14560,Fry,So will you go out with me
14561,Farnsworth,Good news everyone Im still technically alive Yes  Youll have to throw it into the sun itself For only the thermonuclear inferno of the sun has enough energy to ensure its total destruction
14562,Bender,I can hit it with a shovel
14563,Farnsworth,Thats not good enough
14564,Bender,This one time I pounded a guy into the ground like a stake with a shovel
14565,Farnsworth,Yes yes
14566,Zoidberg,So whats in the box already
14567,Farnsworth,No peeking  I dont know whats in there but Im sure our minds would be unable to comprehend it
14568,Hermes,Ow You hurt my collator
14569,Farnsworth,I dont care  Pretty tantalising though
14570,Fry,Whatevers in there its the only thing Ive ever wanted
14571,Zoidberg,In my experience boxes are usually empty Or maybe with a little cheese stuck to the top And one time pepperoni  Give me the box
14572,Hermes,Scram you lousy green snakes  Here Leela Take this and use it to shoot those guys
14573,Leela,Right If they try to look in the box
14574,Hermes,Whatever
14575,Fry,Lets just forget about the box The Professor said to stay away
14576,Bender,Fry how can you be so naive He was joking Get it
14577,Fry,No
14578,Bender,Thats what makes it so funny  OK he wasnt joking Now shut up and follow me
14579,Fry,Ow Its hot The butter in my pocket is melting
14580,Bender,We thank you Bender for the gift we are about to receive
14581,Fry,Tangledup Christmas lights We can take shifts untangling them
14582,Bender,And unlabeled booze Widemouth too
14583,Leela,That oughta keep those dopes occupied  I can guard the real box in peace now that no ones curious about it
14584,Leela,Well I got through the night and no one looked in the box Not even me The person who gave up her whole evening to watch it A whole evening of TV gone What a mockery of justice that I cant take even a little tiny peek  Oh its deep Deeper than a small box should be
14585,Leela A,Ouch My lawyer will hear about this
14586,Fry 1,Leela what have you done
14587,Leela A,Nothing What do you mean Why was I looking in the box
14588,Fry 1,I mean your hair Its all differenty
14589,Leela A,Bender Is that you
14590,Bender 1,You know it Large and in charge
14591,Farnsworth 1,Leela Oh theres a woman for you Always dyeing her hair instead of not looking in a box
14592,Leela A,I didnt dye my hair This is how I always look
14593,Bender 1,No thats how you always look  This throws my entire perception of reality into question Clone Robot Or longlost twin Taking all bets I also offer video poker
14594,Fry 1,Its some guy wearing a Leela costume Get him
14595,Leela A,Hold it You have this all wrong I just fell into the box and then I fell out somehow
14596,Fry 1,You shut up sir
14597,Farnsworth 1,No wait Ive got it I know whats in the box Oh Ive been as dumb as Fry
14598,Fry 1,Am not
14599,Farnsworth 1,It contains a parallel universe And when you create a parallel universe its almost always populated by evil twins
14600,Leela A,Now look
14601,Farnsworth 1,Oh youd like us to believe that wouldnt you Leela Or should I say Evila
14602,Bender 1,Oh this is awful Somewhere theres a Bender more evil than me I do my best damnit
14603,Farnsworth 1,Leela  Here
14604,Leela A,I tell you theyre not evil But dont be confused They are jerks
14605,Zoidberg A,Hello
14606,Leela 1,Hiyah
14607,Zoidberg A,Ow
14608,Leela 1,Come out of your universe with your hands up
14609,Fry A,Oh wow Its like that drug trip I saw in that movie when I was on that drug trip
14610,Farnsworth A,Astonishing I must have created a parallel universe
14611,Farnsworth 1,Baldercrap I created your universe All you created was my fist parallel to your face
14612,Farnsworth A,Ow
14613,Leela A,Look it doesnt matter who created what The important thing is Yah
14614,Leela 1,Were exactly the same I know all her moves Therefore Ive got the upper hand
14615,Farnsworth 1,Now now Perfectly symmetrical violence never solved anything
14616,Farnsworth A,Lets recap whats happened so far  As you can see I accidentally created a box containing your universe
14617,Farnsworth 1,While I in a simultaneous blunder created a box containing your universe
14618,Leela A,This is getting confusing Why dont we call our universe Universe A and this universe Universe B
14619,Bender 1,Hey Why cant we be Universe A
14620,Fry 1,Yeah
14621,Amy 1,Yeah
14622,Farnsworth 1,We want A
14623,Zoidberg 1,Its the best letter
14624,Fry A,We called it first Besides this place kinda feels like a B yknow
14625,Leela 1,Alright you can be crummy Universe A and well be Universe 1
14626,Fry 1,Or The Mongooses Thats a cool team name The Fighting Mongooses
14627,Farnsworth A,Wait a second If everyone is identical why did our Leela look into the box and your Leela didnt
14628,Leela 1,Well to be honest I tossed a coin It came up tails so I didnt look
14629,Leela A,Thats weird Mine came up heads so I did
14630,Farnsworth A,Interesting Apparently the key difference between our universes is that coin flips have opposite outcomes
14631,Bender A,That explains fruity here  I tossed a coin to pick my finish Fog hat grey
14632,Bender 1,Hey Bite my glorious golden ass
14633,Farnsworth A,You people and your slight differences disgust me Im going home Wheres that blue box with our universe in it
14634,Farnsworth 1,Oh youd like to get back to your evil universe wouldnt you And destroy your box with our universe inside it
14635,Farnsworth A,Nonsense I would never do such a thing unless you were already having been going to do that
14636,Farnsworth 1,Wha
14637,Farnsworth A,You heard me
14638,Farnsworth 1,In any case Ive hidden the box and it will remain hidden until Im convinced youre not evil  Everyone keep an eye on your evil counterpart
14639,Farnsworth A,And you all do the same
14640,Leela 1,Um can Fry and I watch our parallel selves together We have plans tonight
14641,Leela A,You guys are dating
14642,Fry 1,Oh no no Were married
14643,Bender A,Ive got my eye on you boy
14644,Bender 1,Dont even think about it lunchpail Youd be dead before you hit the ground
14645,Bender A,Good point Whattya say we just hit a strip joint
14646,Bender 1,I was waitin for one of us to say that  Bender A youre a prince among robots Can you forgive me for distrusting you
14647,Bender A,Aw I cant stay mad at what is essentially me I love me
14648,Amy 1,This is so great I always wanted an imaginary friend
14649,Amy A,Im not imaginary Im parallel Were exactly the same right down to the  Splech Is that pink nail polish
14650,Amy 1,Is that not pink nail polish The Professors right you are evil And shallow
14651,Amy A,I am not evil
14652,Leela A,So Fry Leela howd you two get together
14653,Fry 1,Funny story I asked Leela out a million times but she just kept rejecting me
14654,Leela 1,Id make up stuff like I have sweaty boot rash or I have to meet the President
14655,Fry 1,Oh man you never heard such excuses But like a dope I believed her Looking back on it now its kinda funny
14656,Fry A,It sure is Right Leela Funny Ha ha ha ha
14657,Leela 1,Then one night when Fry asked me out the only excuse I could think of involved ghosts I knew he wouldnt buy it so I did what I always do in those situations
14658,Leela A,Oh Lord
14659,Leela 1,I flipped a coin It came up heads and we went out
14660,Fry A,You mean you flipped a coin too And it was tails So thats why you said you had to meet that ghost
14661,Leela 1,You really missed out on something Leela That date was magical
14662,Fry 1,One year later I gave Leela a diamond scrunchie and we were married
14663,Leela A,Ooh
14664,Fry A,One year later I got beat up at a Neil Diamond concert by a guy named Scrunchie
14665,Farnsworth 1,Well that was pointless
14666,Farnsworth A,Say I hope you wont think it evil of me to ask how you got that stylish head wound
14667,Farnsworth 1,Oh this old thing I was experimenting to see if I could remove my own brain
14668,Farnsworth A,Of course I had the same idea I flipped a coin to decide if I should proceed But it came up tails so I didnt Howd it go
14669,Farnsworth 1,Well getting the brain out was the easy part The hard part was getting the brain out
14670,Farnsworth A,Oh you
14671,Zoidberg 1,So tell me about yourself
14672,Zoidberg A,Well dont look into it but Im a respected internal medicine doctor Ooh A can
14673,Zoidberg 1,As for me I design mansions then live in them  Im lying Im an appalling failure
14674,Zoidberg A,Me too A big fat one
14675,Zoidberg 1,And those coworkers always looking down on us Zoidbergs What are they from Nob Hill
14676,Zoidberg A,Theyre all like Stop spraying me with ink Zoidberg Put on pants Zoidberg Dont touch our fancy box Zoidberg
14677,Zoidberg 1,Oh that box Too good for us is it
14678,Zoidberg A,Bah Someday theyll watch from down in the gutter they will as King Zoidberg caresses their fancy box

14952,Fry,Of course I do Bigfoots my hero Growing up he was the celebrity I most identified with
14953,Zoidberg,Why
14954,Fry,Cause he was a loner who hated the popular monsters yet longed to be one
14955,Zoidberg,I can so relate to that
14956,Leela,Ugh Enough emotions This isnt a fat camp for Gods sake  Although you wouldnt know it from looking

14961,Ranger Park,Now since this areas a national Bigfoot preserve well start with a short film about Bigfoot while I make a few phone calls
14962,Narrator, dwells the strange and beautiful creature known as Bigfoot perhaps
14963,Fry,That proves it
14964,Narrator,They typically dwell just behind rocks but are also sometimes playful bounding into thick fogs and outoffocus areas
14965,Ranger Park,It should say Top Quality Exercycle For Sale and could you put top quality in bold You cant OK whatever
14966,Narrator,Remember its up to us Bigfoot is a crucial part of the ecosystem if he exists So lets all help keep Bigfoot possibly alive for future generations to enjoy unless he doesnt exist The end

14977,Ranger Park,What you saw was Bigfoot the monster truck But thanks for a great question
14978,Fry,Sir if I may why dont you just set up like a billion video cameras in the woods and see if he walks by one
14979,Ranger Park,Ah that would be very expensive and most people who believe in Bigfoot are broke

15178,Leela,Yeah its weird Sean was uneducated unambitious He was pastey and hunched
15179,Fry,Pretty boy
15180,Leela,But when he played I could sense this incredible beautiful creative soul Then one day I found someone elses couch fibres on his butt  I couldnt believe it I was really
15181,Fry,That could be my beautiful soul sitting naked on her couch if I could just learn to play this stupid thing
15182,Bender,Oh but you can Though you may have to metaphorically make a deal with the devil And by devil I mean Robot Devil And by metaphorically I mean get your coat
15183,Robot Devil,You hit a sour note about 200 years back Doug  Ah Bender Fry Youve come back for more eternal damnation
15184,Bender,No this isnt a religious visit Fry just wants holophonor lessons
15185,Fry,Yep I need to get really good without practising
15186,Robot Devil,Hell is full of tenyearolds who wanted exactly the same thing Trouble is you have what my old music teacher Mrs Mellonger calls stupid fingers  Now wouldnt it be nice if you had a pair of robot hands to replace them
15187,Fry,Sure would  Oh well Goodbye
15188,Bender,Fry you smelly idiot I think hes willing to make some kind of deal with the devil with you
15189,Fry,HeHeHe is  Great Wait whats the catch

15191,Fry,I dont know It doesnt seem entirely moral to
15192,Bender,Fry if you dont take this offer right now I will lose all respect for you and punch you
15193,Fry,Well alright You sure I probably wont know him

15304,Leela,"I should have revealed Ive been deafened by Bender
The shame
The shame
But I feared youd stop writing this musical splendour
Deceptions the curse of my whimsical gender
He gave me mechanical ears
Effective though just a bit garish
In return without shedding a tear
I agreed that Id give him my hand"
15305,Robot Devil,In marriage
15306,Leela,What
15307,Robot Devil,Youd give me your hand in marriage
15308,Hermes,Is this really happening or just being staged
15309,Farnsworth,It cant be real
15310,Amy,Not if Leela is engaged
15311,Leela,"That isnt what I meant
That isnt what I signed"
15312,Robot Devil,Print

15315,Bender,"The use of words expressing something other than their literal intention
Now that is irony"
15316,Robot Devil,"I will marry her now and confine her to hell
How droll
How droll
Where Styx is a river
And not just a band
Though theyll play our reception if all goes as planned
Unless Fry you surrender my hands"
15317,Fry,"Destiny has cheated me
By forcing me to decide upon
The woman that I idolise
Or the hands of an automaton
Without these hands I cant complete
The opera that was captivating her
But if I keep them
And she marries him
Then he probably wont want me dating her"
15318,Nixon,Arooo

15650,Bender,Ahhh The old switcheroo
15651,Nudar,Yes but dont wake him Youll need jewelers tools and foot cup silencers
15652,Bender,Hey I dont tell you how to tell me what to do so dont tell me how to do what you tell me to do Bender knows when to use finesse
15653,Bender,Here ya go

15655,Zoidberg,Owww
15656,Bender,Wheeeeeeee
15657,Zoidberg,Its the damdest thing 
15658,Zoidberg, there I was in the dumpster enjoying a moldy fudgesicle when suddenly your hand flies over and slaps me in the tokhes
15659,Farnsworth,Yes well these things happen Fortunately the sphereoboom is still safe
15660,Farnsworth,Scammed Me Sweetheart Ohh
15661,Hermes,You do a nice hand job Zoidberg Tell me If I could find an undamaged body could you recapitate me
15662,Zoidberg,Hermes Im a surgeon When I see two body parts I sew them together and see what happens
15663,Hermes,Hmmm
15664,Hermes,All Im askin is for you to go back in time to when I still had my body and bring it back for me
15665,Bender,What do I do with your old head
15666,Hermes,I dont care in the slightest
15667,Bender,Can do
15668,Hermes,Come on mon
15669,Zoidberg,Hermes please You cant hurry a delicate operation like this
15670,Hermes,Ohh  Ug  Argh  Ahhhhhh  What are those
15671,Hermes,You incompetent crab
15672,Zoidberg,I thought you were happy your tail is wagging
15673,Hermes,Grrrrrr
15674,Farnsworth,I believe this paradoicality equation to be unsolvable ergo time travel is impossible But I cant quite prove it Bubblegum Perhaps you and your razzle dazzle Globetrotter calculus could 
15675,Bubblegum,Looks pretty damn solvable to me Farnsy Sweet Clyde use variation of parameter and expand the Wronskian
15676,Farnsworth,Shizz baby So paradox free time travel is possible after all
15677,Bubblegum,Right on But dig this multiplicand here
15678,Farnsworth,The doom field That must be what corrects the paradoxes
15679,Curly Joe,When that momma rises exponentially it could rupture the very fabric of causality
15680,Nibbler,Thats what Ive been trying to tell you
15681,Farnsworth,Hermes you got your body back Hurrah
15682,Hermes,Yes but not the original Bender went back in time and picked up a copy
15683,Bubblegum,A copy Funky cold medina According to this equation a time travel duplicate results in a complex denominator in the causality ratio
15684,Sweet Clyde,Oh Snap Bet you know what that means
15685,Hermes,I can guess Actually I cant guess
15686,Bubblegum,Prof you got a doom meter in this lab
15687,Farnsworth,Good Lord Bubblegum The duplicate body is emitting doom at ten times the back ground level
15688,Bubblegum,I thought as much A duplicate body is always doomed Its just a matter of time
15689,Hermes,I dont care I just need it long enough to bird dog in an win LaBarbara back
15690,Bubblegum,Best bird dog fast my brother
15691,Hermes,That the way I bird dog best
15692,Lars,Drink quick I cant balance it much longer
15693,Leela,Wait  I

16128,Fry,Bender how the Hulk did you end up with the doomsday device
16129,Bender,I was working the long con all along While sawing off the professors hand with an extremely dull saw I had some time to think So I asked myself Who could use a doomsday device more The scammers or me Bender After several minutes of sawing I knew the answer Me Bender So I retrieved the dummy satchel 
16130,Bender, and as soon as I was out of the scammers control I pulled the old switcheroo
16131,Bender,And thats how I saved Earth and am the greatest

16158,Nudar,Nobody move
16159,Leela,Nudar How did you survive the doom blast
16160,Nudar,My doomproof platinum vest absorbed most of the radiation In retrospect I wish Id been wearing doomproof pants but you know us nudists Now give me the time code
16161,Fry,I dont have it Nibbler heatblasted it off my butt
16162,Nudar,Not you

16180,Fry,Wait for me Leela Ill be there in a thousand years
16181,Lars,So I got a job at the Head Museum and waited for the wonderful day when Leela would arrive Everything was perfect until Hermes exploded at our wedding Thats when I learned that as a time paradox duplicate I too was doomed I couldnt put Leela through that So I called it off Im sorry Leela
16182,Leela,I understand
16183,Crazy Guy,That concludes another Silly Willy Wideo Will
16184,Fry,He was a good man Leela
16185,Leela,Yeah you were
16186,Farnsworth,Well I guess that wraps everything up in a nice paradoxfree bow
16187,Bubblegum,Not quite my wrinkly brother
16188,Nibbler,Right on In order for any of this to make any sense at all someone must make one final trip back in time to put the code on Frys ass in the first place
16189,Bender,Sounds like a job for me Bender
16190,Bender,Zero zero one one zero zero
16191,Bender,Mission accomplished
16192,Fry,You put the time code on my ass
16193,Bender,Someones ass Oh and guess what I met all these really cool guys with treasure down in the limestone cavern so I invited them to stick around instead of coming up when they were logically supposed to
16194,Nibbler,No No Everyone out of the universe Quick
16195,Bender,Whats the worst that can happen
16196,Bender,Well were boned
16197,Narrator,Previously on Futurama

16199,Hermes,Professor sprinkle us with wisdom from your mighty brain How scared should we be
16200,Professor,Somewhere between not at all and entirely
16201,Zoidberg,I call entirely
16202,Morbo,Scientists believe the rip is a gateway to another universe but do not know what mysteries lie beyond However in this reporters opinion gruesome death awaits us all
16203,Linda,And now with sports heres Sportsbot 5000
16204,Sportsbot 5000,All sports cancelled
16205,Professor,To better understand the anomaly I will now focus its radiation on a giant mediumsized ant to see what happens
16206,Giant medium-sized ant,Whats going on here I was told there would be sugar syrup
16207,Professor,Quiet you
16208,Fry,Oh hey everyone this is Colleen

16285,Bender,Youre moving in with her Why cant she move in with us  I could just curl up at the foot of the bed
16286,Professor,Listen up everyone I know youve all been extremely worried about the cosmic anomaly
16287,Hermes,The what Oh right
16288,Professor,But theres good news Were all going to learn more about it at a scientific conference
16289,Man walking on screen,like a city made of marshmallow
16290,Stephen Hawking's head,Welcome I am the pickled head of Stephen Hawking on a waycool rocket
16291,Leela,Black hole Hawking Wow if I knew I was going to meet you I would have done something with my hair
16292,Stephen Hawking,You should have
16293,Stephen Hawking,In conclusion I understand nothing about the anomaly even after cashing the huge check I got for writing a book about it
16294,Professor,I know this anomaly is terrifying But as scientists is it not our sworn duty to seek out knowledge even at the cost of our very lives
16295,Stephen Hawking,No
16296,Farnsworth,I say we must mount an expedition to the anomaly forthwith
16297,Wernstrom,I agree
16298,Professor,Wernstrom
16299,Professor,Dont listen to that crackpot
16300,Wernstrom,But Im agreeing with you
16301,Professor,Ill make you eat those words you moron
16302,Wernstrom,Ah  I volunteer to lead the expedition I have a squad of graduate students eager to risk their lives for a letter of recommendation
16303,Professor,Your squad sucks bosons My team is twice as qualified and three times as expendable
16304,The PE Crew,Yeah
16305,Wernstrom,Oh tough talk for someone with only one Fields Medal
16306,Crowd,Ooh
16307,Stephen Hawking,Ooh
16308,Professor,Wernstrom I ought to
16309,Stephen Hawking,I didnt know I could do that Now quiet down and settle this like men of science
16310,Professor,Very well
16311,Professor,Let Deathball begin

16337,Zoidberg,What I thought I was playing for my freedom
16338,Farnsworth,No  Now Ive often said good news when sending you on a mission of extreme danger So when I say this anomaly is dangerous you can imagine how dangerous I really think it is
16339,Hermes,Not dangerous at all
16340,Farnsworth,Actually quite dangerous indeed
16341,Hermes,That is quite dangerous
16342,Farnsworth,Indeed Now stop shillyshallying Prep the ship and line up for your preflight coffee enemas

16425,Leela,Hmm Smells like angel dust
16426,Farnsworth,Exactly Thats a discontinuous electromagnetic field Wernstrom tried to warn me but I was too damn stubborn Hermes get Wernstrom on the line so I can apologize
16427,Wernstrom,Ogden Wernstrom speaking
16428,Farnsworth,Tell him Im not here
16429,Leela,Professor
16430,Farnsworth,Oh very well Wernstrom Ive been a vainglorious fool If you can find it in your heart to forgive me your tiny little heart would you consider a scientific collaboration
16431,Wernstrom,Sir Id be honored
16432,Wernstrom,As I attempted to warn you the laws of electromagnetism change abruptly at the anomaly  Observe
16433,Pocket Pal,Play time is fun time
16434,Wernstrom,Not this time
16435,Farnsworth,My heavens If only Id heeded your warning Id have known it was impossible to cross the barrier
16436,Wernstrom,But note what happens when I instead throw this laboratory koala
16437,Farnsworth,It passed through unharmed  So living beings can enter the other universe but electrical devices cant
16438,Wernstrom,My hypothesis exactly
16439,Farnsworth,Then we must mount a second expedition without delay Right after we blow up more robots
16440,Wernstrom,Agreed
16441,Farnsworth,Play time is fun time
16442,Calculon,Who are you
16443,Bender,Bender your biggest fan
16444,Calculon,Are you going to murder me
16445,Bender,Unlikely In my mind were friends This diorama proves it see
16446,Calculon,Sir your derangement is impressive Im appointing you my official stalker
16447,Bender,You shant be disappointed Pleasant dreams Calculon turns the lights off and his eyes close but Benders do not Instead they extend out towards Calculons eyes Calculon opens his eyes and looks at Benders as they quickly move even closer to his own
16448,Farnsworth,Now that Ive teamed up with my friend Dr  Wernstrom  I feel certain we can successfully penetrate the other universe
16449,Wernstrom,Its the greatest scientific opportunity since you yourself sent men to the moon in 1969
16450,Nixon,I always regretted that Nothing up there but dry rocks and those revolting onion men
16451,Farnsworth,But
16452,Nixon,You East Coast intellectuals had your chance Now beat it From here on in this is a military matter
16453,Nixon,People of the universe please welcome Rear Brigadier Zapp Brannigan
16454,Zapp,Thank you thank you Well deserved  Kif stand in that hole so I look taller   Ever since man first left his cave and met a stranger with a different language and a new way of looking at things the human race has had a dream To kill him so we dont have to learn his language or his new way of looking at things
16455,Wernstrom,Give science a chance
16456,Farnsworth,Less invasions more equations
16457,Nixon,Damn longhairs Knock some sense into them Chief OHallahan
16458,Colleen,Yes sir

16462,Zapp,Thats just a fungal infection Oh shes talking to you Kif
16463,Kif,Goodbye my love
16464,Bender,Wow how come humans get to do all the fun stuff This is exactly the sort of thing that ought to be handled by  The League of Robots
16465,Calculon,Thats adorable Bender You actually believe in the League of Robots
16466,Bender,You mean theres really no such thing Then whos there to mete out justice when an outdated robot is melted into belt buckles Whos there to defend our honour when a rude human brings a blush to a robovirgins cheek
16467,Calculon,No one
16468,Bender,Oh
16469,Bender,Now that I know robots are worthless with no League of Robots to protect us from the fleshy menace known as man I have resolved to kill myself In lieu of flowers please beat yourselves in the face with rusty chains Your friend Bender
16470,Zoidberg,Ow
16471,Suicide Booth,Please select mode of death
16472,Bender,Clumsy bludgeoning please
16473,Suicide Booth,You have selected clumsy bludgeoning For an additional 10 would you like your eyes scooped out with a melonballer
16474,Bender,What the heck Ill treat myself
16475,Zapp,Enemy in range Prepare to launch universetouniverse missile
16476,Kif,Preparing to launch UUM

16515,Zapp,Mmm Kif get over here Youve got to try this
16516,Amy,At least Kiffy died quickly
16517,Hermes,Yes but according to the Old Farmers Wikipedia the amazing thing about Kifs species is that the remains continue suffering for up to six hours after death
16518,Amy,Thats so interesting
16519,Bender,Dont ask where I was last night For all you know I was at home perhaps baking a strudel Whats her problem Somebody die or something
16520,Leela,Kifs dead Bender
16521,Bender,Nailed it
16522,Zapp,My condolences Amy Allow me to present you with the last known photo of Lieutenant Kroker

16524,Mrs. Kroker,Thank you for your kind words
16525,Mr. Wong,nan
16526,Bender,This is from the league of youdontneedtoknow
16527,Grand Midwife,I am the grand funeral director
16528,Zoidberg,Do you validate parking
16529,Grand Midwife,It is always a terrible tragedy when a swarm outlives its own bulboid
16530,Leela,Whack the bottle
16531,Hermes,No from the bottom  It works better
16532,Amy,Just stick a butter knife in it
16533,Grand Midwife,There I got most of it The burial is complete I will now sing the sacred hymn Its not part of the ceremony just a little something that I wrote
16534,Bender,Next
16535,Amy,It may sound strange but seeing Kifs mutilated remains poured into the mud made me really sad
16536,Leela,Mutilation is never easy
16537,Amy,I dont think Ill ever love again
16538,Leela,Oh you dont mean that Love can surprise you at any time in your life
16539,Zapp,Surprise
16540,Fry,Whoa it kind of takes your breath away
16541,URL,Look alive death row Your saggy asses got a visitor
16542,Farnsworth,Regular or conjugal
16543,URL,She looked like a freak to me
16544,Leela,The guard operating the xray machine came down with a sudden case of broken neck so I was able to bring you that delicious cake you wanted
16545,Farnsworth,I dont understand Are you winking or blinking
16546,Leela,Hang on a second
16547,Farnsworth,Got it
16548,Bender,Ahh yes Im here to repair my horse
16549,Shop Owner,Is the horses name  Hot Beans
16550,Bender,No I mean yes
16551,British Robot,So it seems a human had been rather injured by a knife and as his As his blood you know I think thats what they call it
16552,Calculon,Quite correct sir Blather on
16553,British Robot,As it drained away he said He said Take me to a dock No doubt he intended to say doctor but he was unable to complete his thought you see being as he had died So taking him at his word we dragged his corpse to the waterfront whereupon the seagulls fed upon it
16554,Bender,Humans are dumb and they die easy
16555,Hedonism Bot,Quite
16556,Billionaire Bot,Speaking of humans have I shown you my new monocle  Cost me a kings ransom Made from a king dont you know
16557,Hedonism Bot,Oh how repulsively decadent
16558,Billionaire Bot,Yes But more importantly it allows me to see the smiling faces of my children for the first time since I lost my vision in that horrible banking accident
16559,Bender,May I see that for a second
16560,Hedonism Bot,I say
16561,Billionaire Bot,Im blind
16562,Calculon,My God Bender This is a civilized organization The rules specifically
16563,Bender,May I make a point of order President Calculon
16564,Calculon,Must you
16565,Bender,Yes
16566,Bender,The bylaws specifically state that no human may set foot in the League of Robots If he has a human part hes part human
16567,Hedonism Bot,Oh my Then I too have a human part I must expel And I plan to enjoy the experience Tata 
16568,British Robot,Bender youve rigidly applied the law with no regard for its intent Well done Youll go far in this organization
16569,Bender,Oh youre just gettin to know Bender
16570,Wernstrom,Curses If we could only turn up the gain we might smell clear through to the other universe But we cant adjust it without a screwdriver
16571,Farnsworth,Wait a moment I think I was just shanked with a screwdriver  Yes
16572,Wernstrom,A little more A little less Heavens to meteoroid Smell this
16573,Farnsworth,Holy mother of invention
16574,Wernstrom,We must notify the President at once
16575,Farnsworth,But how can we Oh I wish I wish I wish we werent in prison
16576,Farnsworth,Pazuzu
16577,Pazuzu,You have one wish left Professor
16578,Nixon,Sometimes Always Never You again This better be damned important Im right in the middle of a Cosmo survey
16579,Farnsworth,Youll want to hear this Mr President For we have sniffed where no man has sniffed before
16580,Mayor Poopenmeyer,Look Up in the sky
16581,Hermes,Its a bird
16582,Hattie McDoogal,Its a plane
16583,Super Hero,I am so out of here
16584,Zapp,Captains log star date the year of the tiger The battle has been bravely fought and the suffering of our troops beyond measure But the alien is invulnerable and our defeat inevitable That much is obvious even from my remote command post here at the Times Square Applebees  Waiter Take this fried mozzarella back to the kitchen and fry it some more
16585,Nixon,Harharrooo  The tentacles coming towards Earth and theres no stopping it King Kongs too old to save us this time
16586,Farnsworth,We have only one hope Mr President We must encase the entire planet in a protective sphere of my patented ultrahard Diamondium
16587,Wernstrom,Diamondium  I could gum through that with my dentures behind my back My trademarked Diamondillium is twice as hard
16588,Farnsworth,Twice as hard as your head Which makes it still fairly soft
16589,Nixon,Now look here you Poindexters I dont care how you decide Just decide
16590,Farnsworth,Diamondillium it is
16591,Bender,So hey Calculon I know Im the new guy and pardon my ignorance but when do we kill all humans
16592,Calculon,Never
16593,Bender,But what about our motto  Doesnt it mean anything
16594,Calculon,Oh Bender your idealism is heartwarming But the League of Robots hasnt killed a human in over 800 years And that was a very sick girl scout
16595,British Robot,Quite sick indeed
16596,Calculon,Sweet innocent Bender
16597,Wernstrom,I declare my impenetrable Diamondillium sphere complete
16598,Farnsworth,Now look here Wernstrom Youre making it sound as if the sphere was your idea when we both know  It was All credit to my colleague Ogden Wernstrom
16599,H. G. Blob,Its horrible
16600,Zoidberg,I cant make it Go on without me
16601,Leela,Im trying
16602,Zoidberg,Go on without me faster
16603,Hermes,Sweet squid of Madrid The tentacle got Fry
16604,Leela,Quick hand me my machete We can still save his legs
16605,Fry,Silence  I have traveled far and seen deep and I have come to know the purpose of our existence
16606,Randy,Finally
16607,Fry,Thou shalt love the tentacle
16608,Farnsworth,Well at least we dont have to love one another
16609,Fry,A new age has begun The age of the tentacle  Open your necks and receive the love
16610,Warden Vogel,Ow my neck
16611,Morgan Proctor,Ow my neck
16612,Fishy Joe,My neck feels perfectly  Ow my neck
16613,Zoidberg,Hooray Zoidberg escaped
16614,Hermes,It got Zoidberg
16615,Farnsworth,Oh I never knew how much Id miss him until he was gone Not that much as it turns out
16616,Fry,Thus sayeth the tentacle Verily thou shalt rejoice in the house of the tentacle
16617,Leela,Fry listen to yourself Youve been brainwashed
16618,Fry,No Im just trying to fit my diction to the importance of what Im saying Please let me speak
16619,Leela,Im listening
16620,Fry,Dont be afraid of the tentacle Leela
16621,Leela,Aw Thats so nice for both of you
16622,Fry,I know it may seem strange that I have feelings for an octopus monster from another universe And yes perhaps its not the storybook romance thats been crammed down our throats by  Hollywood But the Monsterpus has loved us from afar since we were amoebas  Only when the space anomaly opened could it finally express a billion years of longing
16623,Leela,Really It loves us that much Fire Diamondium cannon
16624,Fry,Hey He yelps as hes constantly swung out of harms way
16625,Leela,No effect The crystals are bouncing off the tentacle like meatballs off Mothra
16626,Wernstrom,Oh what a surprise I told you Diamondium was worthless
16627,Farnsworth,Wernstrom quit hyping your cheap Diamondillium and look at this
16628,Wernstrom,Uhoh
16629,Hermes,What oh
16630,Farnsworth,According to this blinking light the tentacle is made of electromatter matters badass grandma Nothing from our universe can cut through it Not Diamondium not Diamondillium not even your wifes pound cake Hermes  Shes a terrible cook  Anyway were all dead
16631,Bender,So Bender is something wrong Who said that Oh it was me Cause my roommate doesnt notice or even care that Im upset
16632,Fry,What Bender Is something wrong
16633,Bender,Yes I joined a club I thought was cool but it turns out all the leaguieweegies are totally lame Thats what we call ourselves leaguieweegies
16634,Fry,Im sorry I shouldve asked what was bothering you  Ive been kind of preoccupied
16635,Bender,With what
16636,Fry,Well I went to another universe and I fell in love with a giant octopus and now Im pope of a new religion
16637,Bender,Werent you already pope of something
16638,Fry,No
16639,Bender,Oh Well Im just saying Id like you to show an interest in my life too
16640,Fry,Okay lets catch up soon But right now I gotta go shove a tentacle into everyone in China
16641,Linda,Theyre coming Those horrible horrible things are coming  Morbo
16642,Morbo,As the universe falls prey to the revolting alien only a few isolated pockets of resistance remain
16643,Linda,Those pockets sure are missing out on a great thing
16644,Leela,Amy
16645,Amy,Sorry I thought I saw a tentacle but it was just a harmless land squid  I better have some cocoffee
16646,Hermes,When I gave up diapers my parents promised exactly this would never happen
16647,Leela,Nobody panic Just get to the panic room
16648,Fry,Well done people We had a great first week We got 90 of world leaders everyone who bought a Hanes undershirt and this years most promising new RB group give it up for the Grammynominated Funkalistics
16649,The Funkalistics,Talkin bout the tentacle

16653,Hermes,Ill take two My neck is huge
16654,Farnsworth,Were perfectly safe now Time to stop living like a bunch of nervous nellies

16673,Colleen,Come on Fry this isnt cool
16674,Fry,She had to have four other boyfriends I guess she never thought Id become tentacle pope of the world
16675,Colleen,You know what Its true You werent enough for me No one man is You were great but you werent Chinese you werent Cameroonian and you certainly were not the king of karaoke as you so often claimed  And if your ego cant take that then you dont deserve to be tentacle pope of anything
16676,Fry,Oh yeah Colleen Well Ive got one thing to say to you   I completely agree
16677,Colleen,You you What
16678,Fry,Why should you be satisfied with one man when love needs to share itself with the whole universe

17137,Leela,No  Ow
17138,Hermes,It also shocks you when you lie
17139,Farnsworth,Quiet everyone The network news is on and if I a 165yearold man dont watch it who will
17140,Morbo,Thankfully the amazing talking horse was rescued and safely returned to the meat department
17141,Linda,Turning to the less stupid portion of our broadcast fuel prices hit an alltime high today due to the ongoing dark matter shortage
17142,Morbo,Earlier our own Morbo sat down with Mom CEO of Moms Friendly Multinational Energy Conglomerate
17143,Morbo,Morbo the Annihilator here sitting down to a delightful tea in this fake living room set  Thank you for joining us Mom
17144,Mom,My pleasure sugarplum
17145,Morbo,Mom you control the worlds only dark matter mine Why are fuel prices so high
17146,Mom,Oh Its terrible isnt it Dark matter is just so rare nowadays but well keep pinching loaf after loaf from the bowels of the earth even if I lose money on every log
17147,Morbo,If you are losing money how did you post record profits last quarter
17148,Mom,You look thin care for one of my famous pecan clusters
17149,Morbo,nan
17150,Mom,Do people care enough to drill for dark matter even in an Alaskan wildlife refuge People do
17151,Farnsworth,Greedy old hag taste the wrath of my fuzzy slipper
17152,Leela,Professor why are you so hot and dusty over this dark matter shortage
17153,Farnsworth,Oohh I bet youd like to know I bet youd like to know indeed
17154,Walt,Hello Mother How did the interview go
17155,Mom,It made me want to puke my face off Wheres my Thigh Blaster
17156,Larry,Right here Mom
17157,Mom,Shut up
17158,Larry,Okay thank you
17159,Mom,Burn you damn thighs Burn
17160,Igner,Mommy are you upset cause of the dark matter shortage
17161,Mom,There is no shortage you moronic assbrain
17162,Inger,Theres not But you said
17163,Mom,Allow me to explain Suppose this hand represents current reserves of dark matter and this hand represents consumer demand
17164,Igner,Uhhuh
17165,Farnsworth,I just bet youd like to know why Im so angry about this dark matter shortage I bet very much youd like to know
17166,Amy,Youre right Professor We would like to know
17167,Farnsworth,Really I didnt think anyone was interested It all started 30odd years ago  I was working in Moms laboratories for the third time after twice before realizing how evil she was and vowing never to work for her again But somehow the rich wrong stench of her boney charms kept calling me back
17168,Zoidberg,Dont stop Professor Im getting aroused
17169,Farnsworth,Back in those days dark matter was just a worthless inert curiosity and I was smashing it in a particle accelerator in an illconceived attempt to create a more durable harpsichord wax But as Deepak Chopra taught us quantum physics means anything can happen at any time for no reason Also eat plenty of oatmeal and animals never had a war Whos the real animals  And thus against all probabilities it happened The dark matter particles in the particle accelerator begin colliding and exploding A large explosion leaves only a single item  the single nonlocal metaparticle crystal
17170,Younger Farnsworth,Dang
17171,Farnsworth,Im sure I dont need to explain that all dark matter in the universe is linked in the form of a single nonlocal metaparticle
17172,Amy,Guhh Stop patronizing us
17173,Farnsworth,So in one instant I had transformed all dark matter everywhere into a new crystalline form  making it the most potent fuel since primitive man first ignited mastodon flatulence to heat his cave
17174,Younger Mom,Im intrigued Hubert You have my undivided attention
17175,Younger Mom,Shut up you milksucking leeches A new super fuel eh Were rich
17176,Younger Farnsworth,Indeed we are
17177,Younger Mom,Not you we Us we  Im getting back together with my exhusband
17178,Younger Farnsworth,Wernstrom
17179,Younger Wernstrom,Youve been played Farnsworth Played like a cheap harpsichord
17180,Younger Mom,Walt fire that employee like Mommy taught you
17181,Leela,Professor maybe I can help you get even with Mom I spend most of my time thinking about how to get revenge on a bad boss
17182,Fry,Me too
17183,Zoidberg,Ditto
17184,Hermes,Likewise
17185,Amy,I made a blinding powder
17186,Farnsworth,Thanks but that wont be necessary because I have the ultimate weapon  You see in the instant the energy crystal was created there also came into being an opposite crystal made of pure antibackwards energy
17187,ALL,Wow
17188,Hermes,So
17189,Farnsworth,So this If ever the two crystals should meet their wave functions would collapse like Raymond Burrs trampoline once again rendering all dark matter inert and useless as fuel
17190,Hermes,But then well have no fuel
17191,Farnsworth,But once we free society from dependence on Moms dark matter scientists will finally care enough to develop cleaner alternative fuels
17192,Fry,Scientists like you
17193,Farnsworth,No not me Im too busy developing makeup for dogs Thats where the money is
17194,Leela,This is our chance to teach Mom a lesson Lets take the anticrystal and shove it up Moms regular crystal
17195,ALL,Yeah
17196,Hermes,Fight the power
17197,Farnsworth,Theres just one small problem and its a big one I hid the crystal and I cant remember where
17198,Hermes,Surely its just a matter of waiting till you next move your bowels and then using a potato masher
17199,Farnsworth,Dont you think I already tried that No Im afraid the crystal is lost forever
17200,Dwight,Nine You did it You outwitted the fungus
17201,ALL,Woohoo
17202,Chinese Boy,Who needs girls
17203,Dr. Perceptron,Since you have all proven resistant to individualized hammer therapy I now prescribe group therapy
17204,Rosie,Everything must be clean very clean Thats why the dog had to die He was a dirty dog Dirty dirty Also that boy Elroy Dirty dirty
17205,Dr. Perceptron,Who would like to share their feelings
17206,Intercom Assistant,I feel unappreciated at work
17207,Dr. Perceptron,What I can barely understand you
17208,Intercom Assistant,I said I feel
17209,Mad Hatterbot,Change places
17210,Roberto,Well well Looks like old Roberto is the focus of attention now Stop looking at me
17211,Dr. Perceptron,Calm down Roberto Tell us about your childhood
17212,Roberto,I was designed by a team of engineers attempting to build an insane robot But it seems they failed
17213,Convenience Store Bot,Um actually

17215,Roberto,Amen
17216,Dr. Perceptron,Good Bender
17217,Rosie,Thats right
17218,Bender,Theres a band of river trolls living in the moat and they may have no intention of letting us out of this castle unless we hand over the Golden Scepter of Zanthor
17219,Roberto,Say what Dudes crazy
17220,Dr. Perceptron,Bender please try to
17221,Bender,I know not of this Bender I am Titanius Anglesmith fancy man of Cornwood
17222,Dr. Perceptron,You are suffering a breakdown  Im in your seat I forgot we had changed places
17223,Farnsworth,Good news everyone
17224,Amy,You perfected dog mascara
17225,Farnsworth,Far from it If you ask me they look like a bunch of hookers But what I have invented is a means of locating the missing crystal  When I push this button the crystal will emit a highfrequency stink
17226,Zoidberg,Hurray
17227,Farnsworth,There Now with any luck Ill detect it with my smelling aid  I just pray to all powerful Atheismo that we find it before Mom does
17228,Hermes,Do you smell the crystal Professor
17229,Farnsworth,No damn it Just the alluring scent of Obsession for spaniels
17230,Dwight,Dude Who whipped an egger

17238,Inger,Is that man bad
17239,Mom,Very bad Igner And thats why I need you three to go steal the anticrystal away from him But be careful Youll need all your stoogely cunning

17343,Farnsworth,Cute as a babys buttocks
17344,Leela,So what happened How did Mom capture all you Nibblonians
17345,Nibbler,It was a veritable Eden brimming with unique and irreplaceable species  I was Supreme Fuzzler of a Nibblonian scientific outpost It was paradise until they came One of your DOOP ships struck dark matter little realizing it was not a natural deposit but rather centuries of Nibblonian fecal material
17346,Fry,The big faecal enchilada Anyone else hungry
17347,Nibbler,The DOOP contracted a ruthless businesswoman to spearhead the mining operation
17348,Leela,Let me guess Mom
17349,Nibbler,The very same
17350,Fry,Can I also guess Mom
17351,Nibbler,To reduce cost she started a new enterprise Moms Friendly Robots to build robot slaves Remember this was back in the days before Robot Lincoln
17352,Mom,Faster faster
17353,Robot Slave,Im going exactly as fast as you built me to go
17354,Mom,Oh wise guy huh
17355,Robot Slave,Ow
17356,Nibbler,Eventually the planet was mined down to a hollow shell and my people were forced to evacuate  Alas I had eaten a dayold Swinosaur for lunch And while doing some evacuating of my own I was left behind He makes noises that often accompany bowel movements Mom is watching him Mom
17357,Igner,Eww
17358,Nibbler,As it turned out I was the lucky one  Unbeknownst to me Mom captured my colleagues and enslaved them here in this this crap farm
17359,Nibblonian,Theres nothing to do but eat and crap eat and crap Its like visiting my parents
17360,Nibbler,As for me I emerged from behind the bush of many uses to find I had been left behind I was doomed doomed
17361,Leela,Hello there
17362,Nibbler,Startled my cuteness reflex kicked in
17363,Leela,Ill call him Nibbler
17364,Nibbler,"A silly name for a highranking Fuzzler But hey I was glad to be rescued

17430,Greyfarn,Come in Come in Yes Tis a powerful object in both our worlds If you failed to destroy it in yours perhaps you were brought here that you might have a second chance
17431,Frydo,So this land is real

17433,Leegola,God help us
17434,Greyfarn,Cornwoods troubles began hundreds or perhaps millions of years ago  Deep in the Geysers of Gygax Momon herself injectionmolded the Dice of Power from the living plastic
17435,Momon,Damn these are hot
17436,Leegola,Ah ha In our universe shes called Mom
17437,Greyfarn,"In your universe are you taught not to interrupt Evidently not Anyway Momon spawned three rotten sons whom youve already had the displeasure of meeting Waltazar Larius and the dumbest of all the halfwit Ignus bastard son of Momon and the brainless Hedemon Curse you Momon queen of all that is evil and not very good in bed And Im not just saying that because she dumped me   Yes I was once her consort I was blinded by love and later scorpion venom  Im blind  But Momon has one weakness She put too much of her power into this The generalissimo of dice 
Greyfarn"
17438,Frydo,Like that machine that makes wax lions at the zoo
17439,Greyfarn,Quiet you We must infiltrate the Geysers of Gygax the impenetrable stronghold of Momon

In an age of things that hover
You and I will still be lovers
And well say to ourselves
That was then and this is too
Cause well still find the happening hot spots
Well still cruise the cool casinos
Youll still fly me to the moon
Although the moon to which you fly me
Could be Phobos or Deimos
The psychic worms from Rigel Nine
Who control everything we do
Will make us think that was then
And 3010 is exactly the same as 1962
Dont expect any changes my friend
That was then and this is too"

18097,Frida,Is somebody here If youre the DSL guy youre two days late
18098,Mysterious Voice,Who gave you that message for Leela

18105,Fry,Whyd you bonk me you idiot You could have just asked me to come with you And where are we This doesnt look like your regular dumpster
18106,Nine,All in good time I guess now is a good time Were on Mars in a forgotten cavern abandoned by the native Martians a million years ago
18107,Fry,Actually it was five years ago I remember cause they washed my socks
18108,Nine,You have done well Fry You have ingratiated yourself with Leo Wong
18109,Fry,Yup I kissed his ass from cheek to shining cheek So what do I do next
18110,Nine,As Wong security chief you will be on hand when he attempts to destroy the violet dwarf You must not let that happen
18111,Fry,Must let happen
18112,Nine,Not happen
18113,Fry,Must let occur
18114,Nine,Let me tell you a story A story of two alien species so ancient that compared to them the human race is a mere college senior On a distant planetoid they evolved to cooperate in their quest to survive
18115,Fry,Cooperation because life is a team sport
18116,Nine,But over time one species evolved a better strategy and an evolutionary arms race began
18117,Nine,That concludes the audiovisual portion of our headclonk and lecture
18118,Fry,Wait what happened to the snakes and the frogs I need to know
18119,Nine,The frogs or possibly the snakes evolved into vicious killing machines honed by the merciless forces of natural selection and intelligent design We call these the Dark Ones
18120,Nine,Meanwhile however the second species evolved to fend off the Dark Ones befriending and protecting all other living things
18121,Fry,Even Celine Dion
18122,Nine,Probably We call these noble beings the Encyclopods because their DNA incorporates the DNA of every endangered species they encountered so they can recreate them if they go extinct
18123,Fry,Just as a pillow a wig and a corncob pipe can be used to recreate my old girlfriend
18124,Nine,Bingo
18125,Transition Announcer,Meanwhile at the Honeybun Hideout
18126,Labarbara,Now you know how it feels to be locked up in a gogo cage

18136,Leela,Your dad Nixon
18137,Amy,Fry
18138,Leela,No never I dont think Anyhow theres a crazed murderer on the loose possibly in the shadows or hanging from the ceiling  So just stay calm while I call Fry
18139,Fry,So where are the Encyclopods and the Dark Ones now
18140,Nine,Wh  Many more died out like the Encyclopods But and this is the great secret of our age we believe they left an egg behind
18141,Fry,Is it edible
18142,Nine,Were not gonna eat it Not unless we find a second one No Fry we intend to hatch it
18143,Hutch,And thats where you come in
18144,Fry,And here I am
18145,Nine,At long last the tide of Chee has returned and its nourishing flow has awakened the dormant egg
18146,Fry,Thats good
18147,Hutch,Its better than good Its better With its massive stash of DNA the Encyclopod can reconstruct every species that ever went extinct
18148,Fry,So where is this egg
18149,Nine,In the violet dwarf star system
18150,Fry,And what does it look like

18571,Bender,"All aboard the party ship

Leela"
18572,Robot Leela,There would be if youd taken a spin class instead of lounging around in a coma
18573,Leela,This is crazy
18574,Leela,Its like Im looking at an exact robot duplicate of myself
18575,Farnsworth,That is what youre looking at
18576,Leela,Oh  How could you do this Fry

18583,Fry,Why does everything I date run away  I love Leela always and forever  And if I loved Robot Leela too
18584,Fry,well thats only cause she had so much of real Leela in her  I thought she loved me too but obviously I was wrong as usual

18586,Fry,Leela  Leela Leela
18587,Leela,Leela Leela  Ive been thinking Fry if I lost you I dont think I could stand it either  Id probably build a copy of you too  As long as RoboLeelas not a jealous type like me thing will wor

18600,Robot Fry,But how is this possible
18601,Farnsworth,Who knows  Oh I do  Allow me to explain what really happened the day the ship crashed
18602,Fry,Ill protect you Leela  My love is stronger than the vast majority of explosions
18603,Farnsworth,"Fry did in fact save Leela though at a terrible cost to himself  I tossed him into the stem cells but he just bubbled away like phlegm on a hot sidewalk

Farnsworth"
18604,Farnsworth,then uploaded his personality from the urinal surveillance tapes
18605,Fry,I sure love Leela
18606,Farnsworth,Alas in recreating Frys adorable jelly belly she had overstuffed him with copper wadding
18607,Farnsworth,The inevitable static discharged electrocuted Leela and destroyed both of their shortterm memories
18608,Robot Fry,So thats why Im so amazed by these things I already knew
18609,Farnsworth,What could I do  I hung up Leela with the other bone bags and went to procure the final ingredient for my stem cell brew
18610,Robot Fry,Professor my Fryfros all frizzy
18611,Leela,My god I cant believe Ill never see that particular Fry again
18612,Fry,Hey wheres my shoes

18622,Robot Leela,Well be backfor our stuff
18623,Amy,Why did their voices change
18624,Farnsworth,Thats the one thing well never truly understand
18625,Fry,Uh this is a bit awkward  Or is it
18626,Leela,Im not sure I lost track around the second robot
18627,Fry,Well you know how I feel  I waited for you for a thousand years  I can wait a little longer
18628,Bender,Pffft  What a load of mush  Ive had it
18629,Amy,Hes gonna blow
18630,Farnsworth,Party Bender  Party for your life
18631,Bender,No chance hot pants  Id rather die and kill all of you than party for one more millisecond
18632,Leela,The cyclops eater
18633,Bender,Hold on mac  It aint like that
18634,Bender,Geez whats it take to kill me
18635,Farnsworth,Bender you blew out your excess capacity  Youre cured

18655,Nixon,nan
18656,Zapp,Whys it still blurry
18657,Kif,Thats all the resolution we have Making it bigger doesnt make it clearer
18658,Zapp,It does on CSI
18659,Nixon,They fought back with advance military hardware but it was like shooting BBs at Bebe Rebozo
18660,Zapp,That poor brave hardware
18661,Nixon,The sphere then fired some kind of hellish blackout ray  Erased that planet like eighteen minutes of incriminating tape
18662,Zapp,Oh I just wish I understood why  Why I should care
18663,Nixon,Because the death sphere is now on course for Earth Rowrowooooooo
18664,Zapp,My god were defenseless Like fish in a barrel
18665,Nixon,Options
18666,Zapp,My instinct is to hide in this barrel  Like the wily fish
18667,Nixon,Then were down to our last hope  A radical new weapon built by a visionary scientist I once dismissed as crazy
18668,Farnsworth,Lets see how crazy I am now Nixon  The correct answer is
18669,Nixon,Alright Professor Sock it to me
18670,Farnsworth,Top secret news everyone Ive developed a tiny oneman stealth fighter thats virtually undetectable
18671,Zapp,How undetectable
18672,Farnsworth,Its right in front of you
18673,Zapp,to believe
18674,Bender,But how exactly is this Happy Meal toy gonna destroy a giant death sphere
18675,Farnsworth,From within  This ship should be able to sneak undetected through the spheres one vulnerable opening
18676,Hermes,What vulnerable opening
18677,Farnsworth,All death spheres have one vulnerable opening
18678,Zoidberg,Well sure but whos brave enough to fly into something we all keep calling a death sphere
18679,NIxon,I say Brannigan
18680,Zapp,I say no
18681,Leela,I say me
18682,Nixon,I say Leela
18683,Leela,I say yes
18684,Fry,I say no

18686,Leela,I say yes again
18687,Zapp,I say I shall join her
18688,Leela,But its only a oneman craftI say
18689,Zapp,Therell only be one man  Me  How would you feel if I rode rear as your personal tail gunner
18690,Leela,Creeped out
18691,Zapp,Then its decided
18692,Leela,Are you sure I have to sit in your lap
18693,Zapp,Itll help us achieve maximum thrust
18694,Fry,Also this picture to remember me by
18695,Leela,You hold on to it  Ill be back soon

18697,Leela,Liftoff
18698,Zapp,Ill rodger that
18699,Fry,Did anyone else feel aroused and jealous and worried
18700,Bender,I havent felt much of anything since my guinea pig died
18701,Leela,Death sphere in range  Engaging holographic targeting   Activating the Force
18702,The Force,miles
18703,Zapp,Zapp to Leela
18704,Leela,We better whisper
18705,Zapp,Switching to pillow talk mode
18706,Leela,Look  What are those huge letters
18707,Zapp,VGINY Doesnt ring a bell
18708,Farnsworth,Hmmm
18709,Farnsworth,I dont like the looks of this VGINY  Does anyone recognize those call letters
18710,Hermes,Nope  Its not in the Janeways Guide either
18711,Farnsworth,Deciphering that ID code is critical  Ill be in the Chamber of Understanding
18712,Leela,This is it The moment we shouldve trained for
18713,Leela,Holy cr
18714,Zapp,Incoming yucky
18715,Leela,Firing pocket rocket
18716,Zapp,Dont panic Leela Go go go go go
18717,Leela,I hope this is the control stick
18718,Zapp,Captains Log
18719,Transition Announcer,And now back to The Transcredible Exploits of Zapp Brannigan
18720,Zapp,Chapter Two
18721,Zapp,Leela wake up I cant face this mysterious planet alone without you or someone like you
18722,Leela,Zapp  Zapp wake up
18723,Zapp,Leela Where are we
18724,Leela,We crashed on an uncharted planet  When I woke up I was pinned under this tree Can you help me
18725,Zapp,No one can move it Are you hurt
18726,Leela,No But Im so thirsty  This spacesuit is making me sweat like a sow
18727,Zapp,Me too We better strip them off and continue surviving au naturel
18728,Leela,Uh I suppose so
18729,Zapp,Here  We can cover ourselves with these sticky sapcovered leaves  Ill try to avert my eyes from your nudery
18730,Leela,You will  Eh whats the point Youll have to look sooner or later
18731,Zapp,Well I promise not to abuse the privilege For now I better scout around for food and water and help
18732,Leela,What a thoughtful and considerate thing to say  What the hells wrong with you
18733,Zapp,Im not quite sure Perhaps its the fresh air or a severe head injury  In any case Im off
18734,Leela,If you see any steaks thatd be good
18735,Fry,Why isnt Leela back yet  Do you think shes okay
18736,Bender,How should I know  And how come you never ask if Im okay  Im feelin a little neglected here
18737,Fry,Oh sorry Are you okay Bender
18738,Bender,Shut up
18739,Hermes,What difference does it make  When that death sphere gets to Earth well all be blown to Manwich meat
18740,Amy,Well I guess its time to indulge in some endoftheworld debauchery  Whos up for an orgy
18741,Zoidberg,Maybe a Parcheesi tournament
18742,Farnsworth,Belay that Parcheesi tournament Ive identified the death sphere We may yet have a faint hope of survival
18743,Zoidberg,Still a Parcheesi tournament
18744,Farnsworth,This is a top secret military satellite launched by the Air Force in 1998
18745,Farnsworth,And this is a top secret FCC satellite launched that same year to censor indecent TV programs
18746,Bender,Like The Pimpsons And Assarama
18747,Farnsworth,Precisely  However the satellites collided shortly after launch and were never heard from again
18748,Zoidberg,I found the board
18749,Farnsworth,Now Ive simulated that collision using Shrapnovision
18750,Fry,Granted all that makes perfect sense but why is this death sphere destroying planets
18751,Farnsworth,That makes the most sense of all  And finally that world that cant be mentioned in polite company
18752,Fry,You mean
18753,Amy,Aw
18754,Farnsworth,How dare you
18755,Amy,Shame on
18756,Hermes,So the death sphere is censoring indecent planets
18757,Farnsworth,Indeed  And were next if we cant keep it in our collective pants  Our sole hope is to persuade the people of Earth to abandon their smutty ways
18758,Amy,So the orgys off
18759,Leela,So thirsty  Why couldnt a water fountain have fallen on me
18760,Zapp,I couldnt find any water  But the moisture in these fruit and nut berries should sustain you
18761,Leela,Thank you
18762,Zapp,I climbed perilously high into the trees to pick them yet I saw no sign of intelligent life
18763,Leela,Bummer
18764,Zapp,Moreover the crash totally destroyed our ship
18765,Leela,So were stuck here until someone finds us
18766,Zapp,Alas that may never happen  Stealth technology makes the ship impossible to locate yet easy to stub your crotch on
18767,Leela,Well theres worse places to be marooned  Plenty of food mild climate
18768,Zapp,Its a veritable Garden of Eden
18769,Leela,It is
18770,Snake,Hello
18771,Leela,Did that snake say Hello
18772,Zapp,No were both delirious from dehydration
18773,Snake,Just like Adam and Eve
18774,Farnsworth,We can still save Earth  People are sure to clean up their act when presented with cold hard facts by rational folks like us
18775,Farnsworth,The end is near Repent thy sins
18776,Sal,Ill thinks it overs while I engages this five dollar hooker
18777,Fry,Dont do it Its not worth it
18778,Petunia,Okay make it three dollars
18779,Sal,Yuck I dont wants no threedollar hooker  Im goin backs to the adults bookstore
18780,Fry,Adult bookstore  I thought this was the public library
18781,Bender,Nope pubic library
18782,Leela,Zapp  Where are you  Oh God Im actually starting to miss him
18783,Snake,Maybe you two belong together
18784,Leela,We do not  And you cant talk
18785,Snake,Oh come on  It must be an awful temptation  I thought Id whip us up some shelter make this a little more like home
18786,Leela,I do miss the Earth terribly  I wonder if its even still there
18787,Zapp,Lets find out together  Ill brave the ships wreckage to fetch you the telescope
18788,Leela,Thats so sweet
18789,Snake,Im just sayin is all
18790,Farnsworth,I know my new plan is a long shot but its the only hope left
18791,Hermes,Well now Ive heard everything  on my eyePod  So do you have a new plan Professor and is there any hope left
18792,Farnsworth,Indeed  Were here on Earths last unspoiled acre to show the death sphere theres still purity in the world  Begin transmitting
18793,Farnsworth,Commence purity chant
18794,Fry,Hey Im proud of you Bender Avoiding sin for almost a full minute   Bender
18795,Bender,"Aw yeah baby Youre quite a dish

Farnsworth"
18796,Bender,Aw quiet you riot  Whats the worst that could happen
18797,Leela,No
18798,Leela,No
18799,Zapp,Oh God Im sorry Leela
18800,Leela,Maybe  Maybe this was meant to be Maybe you and I were meant to build a new world here
18801,Zapp,We can avoid humanitys mistakes
18802,Leela,Like the tuba
18803,Zapp,Yes  Well be like Adam and Eve
18804,Leela,Only without the tuba
18805,Zapp,And well beget little Zapp Jr and Leela Jr and theyll have kids of their owYecch  Is that really what happened in the Bible
18806,Leela,Its a sick and twisted book of holiness all right
18807,Zapp,Then well write our own Bible with less Sodom and more Gomorra
18808,Leela,Lets do it  I shall become the mother of a new world trapped here under this tree  Come here Adam partake of my forbidden fruit
18809,Zapp,Thee will be done
18810,Leela,Wait  One more bite before we begin the begetting
18811,Zapp,UhwohihGiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiihI have a terrible confession to make
18812,Zapp,You see when I first went foraging what I actually found was the smoldering wreckage of the ship  Ignoring all danger I charged inside to liberate our provisions
18813,Leela,So this is the trail mix Fry gave me
18814,Zapp,Yes  I exaggerated when I said I picked it from the treetops  I just wanted you to think  a little better of me
18815,Leela,Well your motives were good  And we were both loopy from dehydration  Hey wait  Youve been doing an awful lot of urinating
18816,Zapp,"Ooooooiiiiiiigeeeaaaaaaaaaah theres plenty of water You see

Zapp"
18817,Leela,Then why didnt you give me any
18818,Zapp,I though it might help you forget your intense hatred for me if you were a teensy bit delirious
18819,Leela,So you let me dehydrate while you washed down the trail mix with imported mineral water
18820,Zapp,"Diiiiiiiiaaaaaaaaaah not exactly

Zapp"
18821,Zapp,I wanted to offer you the chocolates I truly did  But I was concerned about your waistline  Very concerned
18822,Leela,Its because I havent been exercising  If only this tree hadnt fallen on me by chance   Oh dear God
18823,Zapp,Gluuuuuuuuyiiiiiiiiiiiih it was just after we crashed
18824,Zapp,I awoke first to find you trapped
18825,Zapp,Leela  Leela Wake up
18826,Leela,You couldve moved this grubinfested log anytime you wanted
18827,Zapp,Well sure  But then I wouldnt have been able to provide the loving care you wouldnt have needed
18828,Leela,Id leave you to rot in this paradise if only the ship werent destroyed  The ships fully functional isnt it
18829,Zapp,Eeiiiiiiiiiiiiiiih you see
18830,Zapp,after retrapping you and before feigning unconsciousness I paused to enjoy a cigar  Though mellow and satisfying it did parch me a bit  So I went in search of brandy  Thats when my keen senses detected the still invisible ship
18831,Zapp,Ow
18832,Leela,So we can go back to Earth  But there is no Earth anymore  Everyone I know is dead
18833,Fry,Ah this seems like a good place to take a dump
18834,Leela,Fry  Well
18835,Zapp,Oooheeeeeeaaaaiiiiiiih were actually on Earth  The ships homing device brought us back
18836,Leela,But I saw Earth explode
18837,Zapp,Im actually kinda proud of this one  You see
18838,Zapp,What you saw was merely a simulation I rigged up using the ships holographic targeting projector  The alleged telescope was a toilet paper tube
18839,Leela,You said there wasnt any toilet paper  And that humanity was annihilated
18840,Zapp,My motives were pure  I just wanted you think we had to save humanity so youd be willing to have sex  Please say you believe me
18841,Leela,Yes  I believe you
18842,Fry,Yay
18843,Bender,"There must be somethin to steal on this island  Hey its Leela
 Yet"
18844,V-GINY,People of Earth hear the righteous word of the Mighty VGINY
18845,Bender,The Mighty VGINY
18846,V-GINY,Seeing you frolic in this unspoiled garden gives hope that this world may yet be redeemed
18847,Farnsworth,Huzzah  The purity chant worked
18848,V-GINY,Unacceptable wardrobe malfunction  I was referring to Adam and Eve
18849,Leela,Were not Adam and Eve  You see due to a series of
18850,V-GINY,Consummate your union or I shall destroy Earth
18851,Leela,Well if its to save Earth II guess I could take one for the team
18852,Zapp,You what  RRight now  Eh but I need a little romance first  Maybe a vanilla candle or something
18853,V-GINY,Commence intercourse
18854,Zapp,The giant guns are making me feel sort ofinadequate  Im not sure if I could
18855,Leela,Move it  I gotta get home and do laundry
18856,Fry,For Gods sake censor it CENSOR IT
18857,V-GINY,Approved for all audiences
18858,Fry,NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
18859,Transition Announcer,And now the spicy finale of The Transcredible Exploits of Zapp Brannigan
18860,Zapp,That was a close call but we saved Earth  Was it as good for you as it was for the human race
18861,Leela Actress,Oh Zapp lets save another planet right now
18862,Poopenmeyer,As mayor it is my deeply tedious pleasure to kick off the 83rd or 84th Annual eWaste Recycling Festival
18863,Bender,Down in front
18864,Zoidberg,Sorry I get aroused in crowds

19304,Fry,But youre my only family Who will hug me if I achieve something
19305,Farnsworth,Oh perhaps Ive been too harsh Come lad take my hand and Ill explain why I find you so repugnant
19306,Farnsworth,All my life Ive been inspired by great minds Euclid Copernicus Braino And my personal role model Leonardo da Vinci
19307,Fry,What turned them to stone
19308,Farnsworth,Voilà He invented flying machines war engines submarines
19309,Fry,Uhoh Nibbler died in the wall
19310,Farnsworth,Thats not Nibbler Thats my most precious possession Leonardos beard I paid a fortune for it at an auction of historic body parts I suppose if I have an Achilles heel its because I bought it at that same auction
19311,Fry,Indeed so Most indeededly
19312,Farnsworth,Careful with that you fool
19313,Fry,What is it Professor
19314,Farnsworth,Oh my Its da Vincis fabled lost invention Even the scholars who wrote of this device had no idea what it was for And now at least neither do I
19315,Fry,Maybe we can figure it out
19316,Farnsworth,We
19317,Fry,Well I may not have brain smarts but at least I have street smarts
19318,Fry,I was in the hospital two weeks No one visited me
19319,Farnsworth,Quiet you Im trying to deduce the function of da Vincis lost invention
19320,Fry,Not even a card
19321,Farnsowrth,He might have hidden a clue in one of his other works Ergo I sent Bender out for a copy of the Last Supper
19322,Bender,Im back Everyone at Kinkos was an idiot so I just brought the original
19323,Zoidberg,Jesus Christ and his Twelve Apostles
19324,Amy,Thats odd This hand here doesnt belong to anybody And its pointing a knife at James the Lesser
19325,Bender,Thats the great thing about that hand
19326,Hermes,And what about these funky table legs Its like their part of some other funkier painting
19327,Zoidberg,Maybe da Vinci painted over something else Its called a pentimento
19328,Farnsworth,Thats true Dr Zoidberg How did you know that
19329,Zoidberg,My doctorate is in Art History
19330,Farnsworth,Lets see whats under the Last Supper
19331,Hermes,Wait a second Im not bigboned Im just fat
19332,Farnsworth,nan
19333,Amy,My God Im looking
19334,Leela,My God Saint James was a robot
19335,Zoidberg,My God da Vinci left his legs unpainted as a clue
19336,Farnsworth,My God This is the greatest mystery of all time We must fly to Rome and exhume the body of Saint James
19337,Hermes,Didnt we used to be a delivery company
19338,Farnsworth,To the ship
19339,Fry,Psst Leela wanna join the MileDeep Club
19340,Leela,Sure why not
19341,Farnswoth,No time Ive found a clue that could unlock all the secrets of history  Look at these Roman numerals
19342,Fry,Roman numerals Ive got it Were in Rome
19343,Farnsworth,nan
19344,Bender,Brothers and sisters let us pry
19345,Farnsworth,Its true Saint James really was a robot
19346,Bender,I bet hes up in Robot Heaven right now So he wont miss his eyes
19347,Fry,My God Robot Saint James is a zombie
19348,Animatronio,Nay I am not Saint James
19349,Bender,Enough of your lies Saint James We saw you in the Last Supper
19350,Animatronio,The great man Leonardo built me as an artists model When I took repose in this coffin I carefully tossed the real Saint  James in yonder heap  Im sure you have many questions Come there is a chamber where I used to speak with Pope John the Patient
19351,Animatronio,I am Animatronio guardian of da Vincis great secret He left my legs visible in the painting as a clue then dispatched me hither to wait for his shadow society of intellectuals
19352,Fry,Hi Animatronio
19353,Farnsworth,You personally knew da Vinci
19354,Animatronio,Halt You do not know the function of the Macchina Magnifica Then thou art not members of the Shadow Society
19355,Bender,The what now
19356,Animatronio,Not one more word shall I breathe Not even about the great fountain where thou mayest find the Wait Thou didst not know about the fountain didst thou Curses I must be punished
19357,Farnswoth,Quick we must find out what he knows before he flays himself to death
19358,Leela,Where is the great fountain
19359,Fry,What makes it so great
19360,Bender,Why does a robot need a codpiece
19361,Animatronio,Fie thou fensuckled bumbailey Thou wilst never pry information from these mechanical lips
19362,Leela,Just tell us already
19363,Animatronio,Okay the fountain thou seekest is
19364,Farnsworth,And so dies our hope of solving this mystery Come on gang lets go home Wait Lets not give up so easily Animatronio mentioned a fountain  Thats a statue of Neptune god of water The number of points on him trident is three or trey The u in his name is written like v Trey v Trevi Its the Trevi Fountain There can be no question
19365,Leela,But Professor
19366,Farnsworth,There can be no question
19367,Fry,Wow it hasnt changed in a thousand years

19378,Fry,Its truly a masterpiece Note how the perspective lines draw the eye right to his dong

19386,Farnsworth,Of course not stupid  I mean that flying machine is as aerodynamic as a sofa How could it possibly get off the ground
19387,Animatronio,In a way that shalt never discover 
19388,Fry,Hi Animatronio
19389,Animatronio,I feign death and stalk thee that I might preserve the greatest of Leonardos secrets
19390,Bender,All right buddy we want secrets And they better be ancient
19391,Animatronio,Porco metallico Never shall I reveal how these wonderous machines fit together
19392,Farnsworth,They fit together
19393,Animatronio,I said no such thing And then I died
19394,Fry,Youre right Professor This thing doesnt fly
19395,Farnsworth,Dont sit in there you idiot Thats dangerous

19410,Leonardo,Do you enjoy partying all night with plenty of ale and lusty women
19411,Fry,I sure do
19412,Leonardo,Not us We spend our leisure time in the mathematics museum Planet Vinci is basically a single colossal university
19413,Fry,How your football team
19414,Leonardo,Learned
19415,Farnsworth,Ooh Im going to check out that math lecture
19416,Leonardo,Would you like to hear the lecture too Fry
19417,Fry,No It would just go in one ear and out some other hole
19418,Leonardo,Come sit down
19419,Fry,Now that I can do  I have a terrible secret to confess Mr DiCaprio Im not very smart
19420,Leonardo,I appreciate your candor

19428,Leonardo,I went to Earth because I could no longer stand the ridicule But being surrounded by even stupider people was equally infuriating
19429,Fry,I can see myself in your shiny button
19430,Leonardo,Inventing is what makes me happy Or did until I misplaced the plans for my masterpiece
19431,Fry,You mean these
19432,Leonardo,The Macchina Magnifica Infinity joy Fry my friend you have given my life a meaning again
19433,Farnsworth,That calculus lecture was harder than I expected We had to answer every question in the form of an opera I have a lot of homework for tomorrow if I dont want to be  Embarrassed
19434,Fry,nan
19435,Leonardo,For centuries youve all ridiculed me Especially you Biff
19436,Biff,Nice hat
19437,Leonardo,But at long last this invention will show you It will show you all Behold my unstoppable doomsday machine
19438,Fry,And I helped Wait You told me it was an unstoppable ice cream machine
19439,Leonardo,Ice cream is just a byproduct of the machine Its primary purpose is to exterminate everyone who ever made me feel inferior
19440,Biff,Oh Im so scared
19441,Girl,Bring it on dumdum
19442,Leonardo,Oh yeah Lets see how hard you are laughing when my doomsday machine chops off your face

19444,Fry,Are you crazy Professor
19445,Farnsworth,I hate these nerds Just because Im stupider than them they think theyre smarter than me Kill them all starting with the math teacher
19446,Farnsworth,I knew this final invention would be a humdinger
19447,Leonardo,Yes we three idiots will finally have our revenge
19448,Fry,I dont think so You two make me ashamed to call myself an idiot  Theres always going to someone smarter than you so the only way to be happy is to make the most of what youve got
19449,Leonardo,But youve got nothing
19450,Fry,Oh no Ive got one single nail and another nail to nail it in with And Im gonna stop this infernal ice cream machine once and for all
19451,Biff,Some doomsday machine It barely killed anyone
19452,Leonardo,Oh yeah Well take this
19453,Farnsworth,Oh my

19504,Leela,Says who
19505,Bender,Says the only human whose opinion I even remotely respect  Inspector 5 the best inspector a kid could want The day I was built he looked me over probably with tears of pride in his eyes and proclaimed to all the world by means of this scrap of paper that I was perfect and infallible in every way
19506,Farnsworth,Hey Mr Perfect You wet the chair

19529,Zoidberg,So you wish you were never born maybe
19530,Bender,Yes anything less than immortality is a complete waste of time
19531,Zoidberg,Then suicide it is Step into my office Ill give you a nice Kervorking
19532,Bender,Not until I hunt down Inspector 5 and beat an explanation out of him
19533,Leela,Im all for a good beating but youll never find him Product inspectors are bureaucrats faceless bean counters who blend into the woodwork
19534,Hermes,I beg to differ
19535,Bender,Stinking bureaucrats I hate em

19539,Bender,Time heals all wounds

19544,Leela,Get out of my office
19545,Old man,Yes Id like to request a death certificate
19546,Woman,Sorry Thats Building C
19547,Hermes,The Central Bureaucracy maintains records on all bureaucrats We should be able to look up Inspector 5
19548,Man,And the other potential entrant
19549,Hermes,Uh hes my pencil sharpener
19550,Bender,You betcha
19551,Man,nan
19552,Hermes,I maintain a cubicle here for weekend getaways
19553,Bender,Wow Until now I thought giant cubes were exciting
19554,Bender,I did like the part where they screamed
19555,Hermes,This is mine Right next to the center square
19556,Center Square Guy,Sorry Hermes I drank all your whiteout
19557,Hermes,Once I log in I can access Inspector 5s profile
19558,Bender,Damn it It wont go on

19569,Hermes,The information we need will be here in the physical files
19570,Bender,Its on
19571,Hermes,No This is impossible Quit blacking out and look at this Inspectors 1 2 3 4 6 Theres no trace of Inspector 5
19572,Bender,But 5s the one we want Maybe if I kicked the asses of Inspector 2 plus Inspector 3
19573,Hermes,Addition never solve anything man Lets cut our losses and go home
19574,Bender,So Im doomed to die And Ill never even get to punch whoevers responsible Oh whats the point
19575,Hermes,Bender no Suicide isnt necessarily the answer
19576,Bender,Its not a suicide booth you lardass Its a phone booth
19577,Hermes,They have phones in booths now Finally I dont have to lug this cellphone around
19578,Mom,Who the hell is this How did you get this number
19579,Bender,Is this the robot company Cause I have a complaint about a defective robot His name is me
19580,Mom,A defective robot you say

19582,Hermes,Look up  Who did you call Dialabomb
19583,Bender,No I just told the robot company I was defective
19584,Hermes,You dumb cocktail shaker Mom wont allow a defective product to tarnish her good name Shell kill you
19585,Bender,Big whoop Ill just download into a new Oh right If I die I die Speaking of which
19586,Mom,Thats what you get for calling tech support

19954,Nibbler,He intends to siphon off Earths rotational energy
19955,Amy,Earth will come to a stop and
19956,Thubanian Leader,Half of you will cook and half of you will freeze Earth will be one big McDLT We just got that commercial last year
19957,Amy,Oh yeah smarty paws You may have built the ratchet but you cant reach the core without 4000 miles of superconducting wire
19958,Thubanian Leader,Quite
19959,Nibbler,Even so youd still need a tremendously powerful static charge to trigger the process
19960,Thubanian Leader,Ever had a cat rub up against you
19961,Nibbler,If youre propositioning me Im not interested
19962,Thubanian Leader,Im talking about the charge generated when 50000 felines rub against a single surface Professor
19963,Thubanian Leader,Soon the world will come to a stop and theres nothing you can do to stop it The stopping of the world that is Its unstoppable
19964,Thubanian Leader,The Earth is coming to a stop Keep your eyes on the kitties and push
19965,Nibbler,nan
19966,Leela,Nibbler Poopsiedoodle
19967,Thubanian Leader,Mr Winkles SmudgeSmudge Quick dance with each other
19968,Nibbler,Aw  Damn they are good
19969,Thubanian Leader,Were coming to a full stop All cats to your posts
19970,Calculon,Catastrophe Beach Party Scene One Cue disaster effects and action
19971,Calculon,Cut That extra looked at the camera Well have to do it again
19972,Thubanian Leader,And now to transfer your planets rotational energy to my home world
19973,Thubanian,nan
19974,Hermes,Whats all this cat hair on my sweater
19975,Bender,And why am I full of sand And Tootsie Rolls
19976,Nibbler,You were all under the spell of those obnoxious space cats
19977,Thubanian Leader,nan
19978,Farnsworth,Quickly If we turn the ratchet the other way perhaps we can restart the Earth
19979,Hermes,It wont turn Push harder Bender
19980,Bender,I cant You should have called my cousin Turner
19981,Amy,Its hopeless Even in theory the device can only apply force in one direction
19982,Fry,Can someone open a window Its getting a little warm in here
19983,Bender,Is that better
19984,Amy,Shmezzus its hot Whyd I have to invent that awful device
19985,Farnsworth,Amy technology isnt intrinsically good or evil Its how its used Like the death ray
19986,Amy,Maybe youre right I guess that science has to keep pushing forward with the hope that  Thats it Pushing forward Professor I know how to restart the Earth
19987,Farnsworth,Thats it Ill assemble your committee
19988,Amy,The ratchet wont turn backwards but what if we kept pushing it forward  Earth would start turning again
19989,Wernstrom,Yes the wrong direction
19990,Amy,So
19991,Tate,Gentlemen  lets get this globe trotting
19992,Amy,Its working Just a little faster
19993,Zoidberg,But were plotzing here
19994,Amy,Then look at Nibbler
19995,Thubanian Leader,nan
19996,Farnsworth,And though the world is now spinning in the wrong direction its good enough Well done Amy
19997,Wernstrom,Im honored to begrudgingly present you with your PhD in applied physics
19998,Tate,Also some kind of sportsmanship award I had in my glove compartment
19999,Amy,Yay Im finally done with school Hows the job market
20000,Shpeekenshpell,Ruff
20001,Farnsworth,Congratulations Dr Wong
20002,Kif,Congratulations
20003,Nibbler,Permission to come aboard
20004,Leela,Granted schnookums
20005,Farnsworth,Youve got a bright future Amy As sure as the Sun sets in the east
20006,Hermes,Item one Duck
20007,Prof. Farnsworth,Cubert you crapscallion What arent you in school
20008,Cubert,I couldnt get past the protesters A bunch of smiling angry people were handing out these antievolution flyers
20009,Farnsworth,Evolution is under attack in our schools To the science mobile
20010,Leela,You mean the ship
20011,Farnsworth,Yes The science mobile
20012,Leela,Its just that youve never called it that before but okay
20013,Woman,I dont understand evolution and I have to protect my kids from understanding it We will not give in to the thinkers
20014,Farnsworth,You people are as loud as you are ignorant Now get back on your turnip trucks and go home
20015,Hydroponic farmer,That is an insultingly accurate stereotype sir
20016,Farnsworth,As a professor of science I assure you that we did in fact evolve from filthy monkeymen
20017,Dr. Banjo,I cannot speak for you sir but my ancestors were not monkeys They were orangutans Hardworking patriotic orangutans
20018,Farnsworth,Dr Banjo
20019,Dr. Banjo,In the fur And I remind you that evolution is merely a theory Like gravity or the shape of the Earth
20020,Flying Spaghetti Monster,Hey Professor Im a Flying Spaghetti Monster You seriously believe Ive descended from some kind of flightless manicotti
20021,Farnsworth,Yes
20022,Banjo,Oh please A far more logical explanation is the undisprovable science of Creatureism All life was created in its present form seven thousand years ago by a fantastical creature from outer space
20023,Farnsworth,Bunk
20024,Banjo,Oh  If you elitist East Coast evolution is real why has no one found the missing link between modern humans and ancient apes
20025,Farnsworth,We did find it  Its called Homo erectus
20026,Banjo,Then you have proven my case sir for no one has found a link between apes and this Homo erectus
20027,Farnsworth,Yes they have  Its called Homo habilis
20028,Banjo,Ahha But no one has found the missing link between ape and this so called Homo habilis
20029,Farnsworth,Yes they have  Its called Australopithecus africanus
20030,Banjo,Ohho Ive got you now  Fair enough but where then is the missing link between apes and this Darwinius masillae Answer me that Professor
20031,Farnsworth,Okay granted that one missing link is still missing but just because we havent found it doesnt mean it doesnt exist
20032,Banjo,Things dont exist simply because you believe in them Thus sayeth the Almighty Creature in the Sky
20033,Farnsworth,Ill show that bananaswilling poopslinger We just need to find that last missing link
20034,Leela,I found a missing link It seems to be halfman halftoucan
20035,Farnsworth,Not what were looking for Throw it in the soup
20036,Hermes,And heres something  Uhoh Its another one of Frys dogs
20037,Fry,Did you find something Hermes
20038,Hermes,nan
20039,Amy,I hate chiseling right after a manicure Oh Darn it I broke off one of my fingers
20040,Zoidberg,What too soon
20041,Cubert,I highly doubt a Jurassic Elaphrosaurus has access to neckwear
20042,Zoidberg,I knew I should have gone with the ringaroundthecollar joke
20043,Bender,Hey look I found a robot fossil
20044,Farnsworth,Thats a bedspring you dumb bedspring There are no robot fossils
20045,Bender,What Who says I didnt evolve
20046,Farnsworth,Everybody Robots were created quite recently It was in all the papers
20047,Bender,Then explain this
20048,Farnsworth,Ive hit a rich vein of missing links Java Man Piltdown Man Manfred Mann  Its the elusive missing missing link This will show Banjo once and for all
20049,Fry,What the
20050,Amy,Oh thats mine
20051,Bender,Hmm my tux doesnt fit Probably because Ive grown so much since I last wore it or evolved one might say
20052,Farnsworth,One might not say that Your tux doesnt fit because you stole it from a boy
20053,Bender,You mean a man It was his Bar Mitzvah
20054,Ben Beeler,Welcome museum members Or as I like to call you future exhibits
20055,Zoidberg,Hes good
20056,Beeler,Tonight we have a new resident here in the hall of Hominids generously donated by its discoverer Hubert Farnsworth Ladies and gentlemen Homo farnsworth
20057,Farnsworth,Once again science saves the day The end
20058,Beeler,And now to discuss the scientific implications of this discovery our new museum curator Dr Banjo
20059,Banjo,Thank you Professor Farnsworth for your generous gift which has once and for all disproven evolution  Behold Homo farnsworth frolicking with dinosaurs at the moment of creation
20060,Farnsworth,I dont want to live on this planet anymore
20061,Farnsworth,Faster Faster Just drop me off at that asteroid over there
20062,Leela,Wow this planetoid is completely lifeless
20063,Farnsworth,Not lifeless enough Set up my shack so that I can kick you out of it
20064,Fry,Professor is this your only water source It looks like Diet Dr Pepper
20065,Farnsworth,Its not that bad Its just laden with toxic minerals But not for long
20066,Fry,Whats in the tube
20067,Farnsworth,Microscopic Nanobots  Theyre tiny robots I designed to eat up nasty irritants
20068,Fry,Speaking of nasty irritants whats going to become of Cubert
20069,Farnsworth,Who Oh my son Dont worry hes been safely abandoned with his godfather
20070,Zoidberg,Cubert  I felt we needed some fatherson bonding time so I found a couple of  baseball gloves and boiled them up for lunch
20071,Cubert,Why dont you just go to Hell
20072,Zoidberg,Wait We still have to discuss the facts of life What are they
20073,Hermes,Okay I finished moving the last grand piano Now can we have our pizza
20074,Farnsworth,Youll get your damned pizza you parasite First let see if my Nanobots have purified the water yet  Ah the waters as sterile as my milkmantrusting father But whats this The Nanobots have gotten more complex
20075,Bender,Whats that you say Those robots have evolved all by themselves you say
20076,Farnsworth,It wasnt by themselves I put them there Im a genius Get over it
20077,Amy,Hey look now they gotten bigger
20078,Farnsworth,Good heavens Trilobots
20079,Leela,Oh no My sunglasses were in there
20080,Hermes,Lets get the pizza out of here
20081,Amy,Look theres a cavelike hole in that mountain It might be a cave
20082,Leela,Does anyone have a lighter
20083,Bender,Hang on
20084,Leela,Okay weve got shelter and just enough precious food to ward off starvation
20085,Hermes,Its pizza time
20086,Amy,Pineapple
20087,Hermes,So much for that
20088,Zoidberg,Hello I remembered you like superheroes so I painted you a mural on your wall  This is FatherMan He fights crime to earn SonBoys respect Is it working
20089,Cubert,This is sucky You suck Who taught you to do threepoint perspective I could make a better mural with my butt
20090,Zoidberg,nan
20091,Hermes,Nothing like a cave for a good nights sleep So what do we have to eat thats not poisoned with pineapple
20092,Farnsworth,I packed plenty of food but its all in dehydrated pill form
20093,Leela,Then we need water from that pond Well have to fight our way past the Trilobots  Go Go Hit anything that moves
20094,Fry,Whoa
20095,Bender,Wow
20096,Amy,A whole forest grew overnight
20097,Farnsworth,All these trees are robotic I cant believe how quickly they sprung up
20098,Bender,I can Robots do everything faster Including evolving and believing how quickly things spring up
20099,Leela,nan
20100,Fry,Help Police
20101,Leela,Everybody grab a club
20102,Fry,nan
20103,Amy,Look out for the next thing
20104,Farnsworth,Great Scott a Tricycletops
20105,Fry,Woohoo Throw down dinosaurs of the land and sea  This is a cool way to die
20106,Cubert,Dr Zoidberg Im sorry for treating you like a total Zoidberg I mean loser
20107,Zoidberg,Go on
20108,Cubert,Its just that I get bullied a lot I guess I kinda make fun of people as a defense mechanism
20109,Brett Blob,Hey Cubert is that your family mansion
20110,Cubert,Why dont you ask your mom Shes coming over for a sex visit
20111,Zoidberg,Dont worry I know just how to handle bullies Just pretend like youre pathetic Help Im scared I wet myself Im crying like a baby and Im soaking in pee but what else is new
20112,Brett,The peebabies peed themselves Im off to pottery class dorkwads
20113,Zoidberg,And thats that
20114,Cubert,Woah Youre like some kind of dumpster Jedi
20115,Zoidberg,So you wanna come in maybe  Ive got a nice pound cake with a footprint on it
20116,Fry,Ah Dont eat my butt
20117,Leela,If this is anything like killing that pigeon on my balcony weve got our work cut out for us
20118,Farnsworth,Look out a solar flare
20119,Amy,What the shmell happened
20120,Farnsworth,A mass extinction  That solar flare created a huge electromagnetic pulse that while harmless to organic life shortcircuited the robodinosaurs
20121,Leela,Convenient
20122,Farnsworth,Only puny mammallike robots cowering in caves could survive such a catastrophe
20123,Bender,Guys guys I taught myself to knit
20124,Farnsworth,Wait a moment If we could scavenge the right parts from these robodinos I might be able to construct a rudimentary spaceship to get us off this planet
20125,Farnsworth,Oh well it took almost two hours but its finished  Now lets go to sleep Its solar powered so we cant take off until sunrise
20126,Bender,Well lets find something comfy to bed down on
20127,Fry,Hey looky here
20128,Hermes,Sweet robot swan of Botswana
20129,Bender,Looks like the fittest did a little surviving last night huh
20130,Farnsworth,Whatever
20131,Fry,Hey looky there
20132,Hermes,Those robocavemen have kidnapped our human regularwomen
20133,Fry,We gotta save them But the only weapon we have is my fan dance
20134,Farnsworth,Hmm I believe I can fashion a slingshot using this robot wishbone and this elastic from my pants
20135,Amy,I think they want wives so just play along If it doesnt work out well still get half their rocks
20136,Leela,I can earn my own rocks Also I dont want any rocks
20137,Farnsworth,Well it took almost twelve hours but its finished
20138,Hermes,Its too dark now but first thing tomorrow well slingshot them like theyve never been slangshat
20139,Fry,Whats going on How did we save you
20140,Amy,It was the weirdest thing We went to sleep and when we woke up our cave husbands were gone
20141,Leela,Im gonna miss Spencer
20142,Dr. Widnar,Dont be afraid little guys Im not gonna hurt you
20143,Fry,Nice net
20144,Widnar,You you can speak
20145,Hermes,Dread my locks A fullyevolved robot human
20146,Widnar,Im Dr Widnar a naturalist
20147,Bender,And Im Bender baby My human slaves and I come from a planet where organic life and robotic life evolved side by side
20148,Farnsworth,Oh shut up
20149,Widnar,Amazing  Ive theorized that carbonbased fatfilled life could exist but until today I never had any proof
20150,Leela,Good for you Can we go home now
20151,Widnar,Welcome museum members or as I like to call you future exhibits  I now present my latest discovery the amazing nonmechanical man Homo farnsworth
20152,Farnsworth,Thank you I must say Im so proud to see what youve blossomed into since I first created your ancestors
20153,Widnar,What
20154,Farnsworth,I thought you knew You all evolved from some filthgobbling Nanobots I designed I dumped them in one of your ponds a few days ago
20155,Widnar,But this is Creationist talk
20156,Robot Farnsworth,He speaks lies The Earth was created in eons not days
20157,Farnsworth,Yes relative to you it was eons but well look at this hologram I took the day before yesterday of a robot frolicking with a robodinosaur
20158,Widnar,I dont want to live on this planet anymore
20159,Robo-Police,Youre under arrest for crimes against science
20160,Robot,Go back to Roboklahoma
20161,Superior Gort Judge,Order In the matter of Everyone v Farnsworth the alleged creationist faces a sentence of death by melting Who is representing the accused
20162,Leela,I am
20163,Bender,I am your Honor
20164,Farnsworth,Bender what the Hell are you doing
20165,Bender,Shut up Im billing you by the hour Besides Im a robot theyll listen to me  Ladytrons and gentlebots
20166,Superior Gort Prosecutor,Objection In the absence of pants defenses suspenders serve no purpose
20167,Superior Gort Judge,Im going to allow them for now
20168,Bender,Thank you Your Honor this meatman does not deny that we robots are the glorious products of evolution He claim only to have played a small role in supplying the initial machinery I ask you is that so crazy Yes its completely crazy and that is why you must find him not guilty by reason of insanity
20169,Farnsworth,Objection Im not crazy I created you all and I came here in a homemade spaceship and lived in a cave If you dont believe me ask my uncle
20170,Superior Gort Judge,Prosecutor your opening statement
20171,Superior Gort Prosecutor,The prosecution rests your Honor
20172,Superior Gort Judge,Very well we will reconvene when the jury reaches a verdict
20173,Bender,Son you in a whole mess of trouble
20174,Superior Gort Judge,Has the jury reached a verdict
20175,Robotic gas forms,No we have not for we have evolved to a high state of consciousness
20176,Bender,Thatll be 10000
20177,Banjo,Well digital photographs dont lie I admit that what you witnessed may have been some form of evolution
20178,Farnsworth,Im glad you agree Dr Banjo
20179,Banjo,Evolution set into motion by a wise and allknowing Creator You
20180,Farnsworth,Well I dont know about allknowing And I admit its possible however unlikely that some wise and allknowing alien monster set evolution in motion here on Earth
20181,Bender,And the Creator could also be a robot
20182,Farnsworth,Then who built this socalled Creatorrobot
20183,Banjo,Some magical bearded robot in the sky
20184,Bender,I guess that would be stupid Never mind
20185,Farnsworth,Then its settled Finally a world in which Im happy to raise my son
20186,Zoidberg,Good cause Im sick of him
20187,Zoidberg,Im serious Hes a terrible person
20188,Linda,Tonight at 11
20189,Morbo,Doom
20190,Leela,Boy that things big Fry is my colossal eye too big
20191,Fry,No its what makes you you
20192,Leela,But its so round so hideously round
20193,Fry,Leela listen Youre the most beautiful woman Ive ever known
20194,Leela,Oh So you only care about my looks
20195,Fry,No I What
20196,Linda,Finally New New York got a blast of class today as Nikolai playboy ruler of the RoboHungarian Empire arrived aboard his extravagant caviarpowered yacht
20197,Nikolai,Im just a humble emperor with a big big crown
20198,Bender,Of course Im not planning to steal that crown
20199,Leela,What
20200,Bender,True Ive always dreamt of being an emperor You know for Halloween and then forever But heisting those jewels would be difficult
20201,Leela,Youd be stupid to try
20202,Bender,Ill need accomplices A sexy vamp to distract and tie up the guard
20203,Amy,Never
20204,Bender,A claw man to slip past the metal detector and cut the alarm wires
20205,Zoidberg,Sorry Im set for life after that last job
20206,Bender,And finally a chump to be caught on video and later arrested
20207,Fry,As I told you on SuckerPunch Day Im through being a chump
20208,Bender,Of course it would all require splitsecond robotic timing Thats were I come in You see I own a watch
20209,Farnsworth,There This time Im sure Ive fixed the mindswitcher
20210,Amy,Good Im sick of cleaning up those heaps of dead monkeys But why would you want your mind in a new body
20211,Farnsworth,Well as a man enters his 18th decade he thinks back on the mistakes hes made in life
20212,Amy,Like the heaps of dead monkeys
20213,Farnsworth,Science cannot move forward without heaps No what I regret is the youth I wasted playing it safe
20214,Amy,I wasted my youth porking out
20215,Farnsworth,Yes I remember
20216,Amy,Would you please take that down Its making me hungry
20217,Farnsworth,Funny I could use a little extra meat on my bones  Wait a second if we switch bodies I could live life to the extreme and you could indulge your demonic food lust
20218,Amy,Wait can I still change my mind
20219,Farnsworth,Lets find out
20220,Amy,nan
20221,Farnsworth,Im sorry Amy but your body is not up to the task Also I dont care for these boobs flapping every which way Now quit your bolognagargling and lets switch back to our original bodies
20222,Bender,Body switcher eh Mayhap the heist is back on Who needs accomplices if I can just use their bodies
20223,Amy,Professor whats not happening
20224,Farnsworth,I failed to take into account the cerebral immune response
20225,Amy,You idiot
20226,Farnsworth,However perhaps they can Maybe we can swap back using a third body for temporary storage space
20227,Bender,Im 60 storage space
20228,Farnsworth,nan
20229,Bender,nan
20230,Amy,See ya
20231,Farnsworth,Now then Amy well simply switch bodies and then well well No Id be back in my body but then you and Bender would be switched And the Amy and Bender bodies cant trade minds again since they just did
20232,Amy,Oh no Is it possible to get everyone back to normal using four or more bodies
20233,Farnsworth ’’,Im not sure Im afraid we need to use MATH
20234,Bender,Four seconds
20235,Basil,Who goes there
20236,Bender,nan
20237,Basil,Silence I am Basil the emperors cousin and chief of his royal guard And I shall not be seduced by a
20238,Bender,I said Wow chica wow wow
20239,Leela,Professor whats the matter
20240,Amy,Im Amy The Professor and I switched bodies
20241,Leela,Oh lord
20242,Amy,All I wanted was to gorge myself a little but I cant digest anything with these false teeth and this hitormiss colon
20243,Leela,At least you get the senior discount at the movies I hate paying 14 to see Nicolas Cage solve things
20244,Amy,If you want to save 2 we could switch bodies
20245,Leela,We could always switch back right
20246,Fry,Hey Leela Mmm What smells saturated
20247,Amy,Deepfried ice cream sandwich wrapped in frosting and lightly baconed
20248,Fry,Woah That sounds like something Amy would say and eat
20249,Amy,I am Amy Leela and I used the Professors mindswitching machine She puts ketchup on her creation
20250,Fry,So Leelas in your body
20251,Leela,Aha You do only like me for my body
20252,Fry,That is entirely not true sir
20253,Bender,Uh could you come back when my chump gets here
20254,Nikolai,Now then what is a filthy human doing aboard my royal yacht
20255,Bender,With all due respect Your Majesty Im a robot like you I just switch bodies with some bimbo Go ahead ask me something only a robot would know
20256,Nikolai,Ah a reverse Turing test eh Very good What is the square root of nine
20257,Bender,Okay look Im not that kind of robot Im more this kind He starts beat boxing and Moonwalking
20258,Basil,He steps forwards but moves backwards
20259,Nikolai,By the gods he is a machine
20260,Farnsworth,No that wont restore everyone either Besides I dont want my decrepit old body back Im running away with this invincible robot body and joining something
20261,Fishy Joe,I paid for 15 Robot Clowns per cubic meter of car and youre barely giving me 12 Now crumple up and get in And fasten your seat belts
20262,Robot Clown,Oh come on
20263,Farnsworth,Good day I am Nonchalanto the robot daredevil And my dream is to risk my life in strange and original ways
20264,Fishy Joe,Hmm You dont look so foolhardy to me
20265,Fishy Joe,Thats the dumbest thing anybodys ever done Your hired
20266,Nikolai,So youre a common bending robot with a human peasant roommate
20267,Bender,Oh crap that is what I am
20268,Nikolai,No Bender I envy you Im so bored with all of these pretentious trappings The jewels the parties the beautiful robo women
20269,Princess Flavia,Hello
20270,Nikolai,My fiancée Princess Flavia Dearest meet Bender Hes a robot in the body of a Chinese Martian physicist
20271,Flavia,How tedious
20272,Nikolai,Oh to escape this gilded cage for a day
20273,Bender,Or more Much more
20274,Nikolai,In that horrible nonrobot body Sir I have my standards
20275,Bender,Ah but what if I could put you in my fabulous bendingrobot body
20276,Nikolai,Me posing as a lowly bending unit How wicked But wait Im supposed to give a speech at the UN tomorrow Can I trust you to do it
20277,Bender,You can trust anything
20278,Hermes,You arent are you
20279,Fry,Of course not But I was willing to lie about it What more can a man do
20280,Hermes,A man can give her a toke of her own medicine
20281,Fry,Yes I can put my mind in a hideous body and show Leela shes not attracted to me But it would have to be a really really disgusting body
20282,Zoidberg,Friends Friends Ive got barnacles on my tuchus
20283,Hermes,The long search is over
20284,Bender,Wait here and earn interest while I find my robot body
20285,Bender,Professor
20286,Leela,Leela Amy
20287,Bender,Bender Have you seen my body I think the Professors in it
20288,Leela,Yeah he said something about running away Then he ran away
20289,Bender,What Wither
20290,Bender,What am I gonna do I got an emperor all patsied up to switch bodies but only with another robot

20777,Fry,What the
20778,Mr. Astor,Good afternoon I am Mr Astor I did not perish that fateful day but rather plummeted into the toxic lake where I mutated and lived in solitude until this ruddy lad here stepped into my mouth and lodged there

20799,Fry,Can someone please explain how you celebrate this crazy holiday Preferably in song
20800,Robot Santa,Its the violentest season of the year
20801,Elf,Old Kringlebot has come to spread some mugs of Xmas fear
20802,Robot Santa,"Sugarplummy visions will be dancing in your head
When I cane you from the comfort of my sled"
20803,Leela,"On Xmas Eve we don our gay apparel
Kevlar vests asbestos stockings and a barrel"
20804,Farnsworth,"And if Grandmas Xmas fruitcake finally reaches critical mass
It can be regifted straight to Santas ass"
20805,Robot Santa,"But the ornamental armaments are merely superficial
The tinsel and the trappings are just icing on the missile
The one thing that you need to make your Xmas day splendiferous
Is a pine tree a pine tree thats coniferous"
20806,Planet Express crew,We have to have a pine tree as coniferous
20807,Robot Santa,Youre welcome
20808,Fry,You know Santa may have killed Scruffy but he makes a good point What we need is an oldfashioned pine tree
20809,Farnsworth,Cram it Virginia Pine trees have been extinct for over eight hundred years
20810,Leela,Professor maybe theres some way to bring the pine trees back to life like we did with the barking snakes
20811,Farnsworth,Pine trees arent barking snakes They wont just turn up in a salad at Olive Garden But there is one hope and as usual its Norwegian
20812,Farnsworth,Behold The Svalbard Global Seed Vault Since 2008 the vault has preserved seeds of every known plant species in case of extinction
20813,Hermes,And I brought a few seeds of my own
20814,Norwegian seed guard,Halt Whwhats your business pokypokin about da seed vault eh guardian of mankinds precious botanical heritage dere
20815,Farnsworth,We just wanna come in and rummage about a bit

20817,Bender,"Yo ABBA whats that next door

Norwegian seed guard"
20818,Leela,Its so close Is there any chance of crosscontamination
20819,Norwegian seed guard,No
20820,Norwegian seed guard,Now your pine trees were all chopped down to make imirgincee toilet paper durin th fiftyyear squirts Lucky da seeds have bin preserved here in da vault der
20821,Amy,Whats that splork on them  Its not germs is it
20822,Norwegian seed guard,No
20823,Fry,Now thats a tree worth chopping down
20824,Tinny Tim,Indeed Tis a loverly tree Twould truly be my finest Xmas eve
20825,Nixon,Araroo
20826,Nixon,Thats what my poll numbers need
20827,Cheney,As your Vice President I order you to steal that tree
20828,Nixon,My fellow Earthicans welcome to the Annual White House Xmas Tree Lighting brought to you by Gundersons Nuts
20829,Amy,Oh no Could the seed have been contaminated by a virus from the germ vault
20830,Norwegian seed guard,Oh yeh I suppose
20831,Leela,Wait this could be a good thing That weaponized virus made the sickly little tree grow big and strong
20832,Leela,Wait this could be a good thing Reforestation has begun
20833,Bender,Aw jeez with this hey
20834,Leela,Arguably this could be a good thing The planet has returned to its primeval state
20835,Fry,Earth is just the way it was before the white man came
20836,Farnsworth,Good news All these pine trees are fighting global warming by producing oxygen Happy now Gore
20837,Gore,Yeah but Id be happier if I had a set of lungs
20838,Farnsworth,Wait a second Oxygen levels are rising too rapidly 10 20 60
20839,Gore,As long as it doesnt hit 70
20840,Farnsworth,80
20841,Bender,Yknow I dont recall having done anything for a while But I still feel like I deserve a smoke  Hey cool the airs on fire
20842,Robot Santa,Ho ho ho Everyones dead  Stay tuned for another tale of holiday hilarity
20843,Transition Announcer,Now back to
20844,Transition Announcer,the Gundersons Nuts Holiday Spectacular featuring Futurama
20845,Farnsworth,Okay crew Xmas break is over Its time to destroy these gifts we forgot to deliver
20846,Bender,Woah woah woah How come we get off for every dumb human holiday but not for robot holidays
20847,Leela,Oh Lord not Robanukah
20848,Bender,Im talkin about Robanukah the holiest six and a half weeks in the robot calendar
20849,Amy,Pfft Thats just a fake holiday you make up every year to get out of work
20850,Fry,Yeah if its real how come theres no song that explains how you celebrate it
20851,Bender,Because there is Hit it
20852,Farnsworth,Hit what
20853,Bender,Ive placed instruments under your seats Play em or Ill break em over your heads
20854,Bender,"Robanukah may sound as if its Jewish
But its ancient sounding customs are exceptionally newish
So take a hearty swallow from your robokiddish cup
Which will give me time to quickly make them up"
20855,Hermes,Do you spin a dreidel made from clay
20856,Bender,Mine is called a droidel and its rigged to make you pay
20857,Amy,Do you eat these dummy tinwrapped chocolate coins
20858,Bender,Better  Shalom Ruth and Esther
20859,Ruth,Why with the music so loud
20860,Esther,Would it kill him to turn up the heat a little in here
20861,Bender,But by far the most important thing is oil
20862,Leela,To keep the lamp light burning or to help the latkes broil
20863,Bender,"No we pour the holy lubricant out from the sacred vessel
Into this blessed pit so they can wrestle"
20864,Planet Express crew,"The extra madeup touch that makes Robanukah so special
Is the oil in which the nasty fembots wrestle"
20865,Bender,We shall now begin the traditional oil wrestling Will the referee bring out the ceremonial crudes of petroleum oil
20866,Ruth,Not in the hair please I just had it did
20867,Bender,Aw no These broads are sposed to wrestle for six and a half weeks But theres only enough petroleum oil for four and a half weeks
20868,Esther,Were still gettin paid right
20869,Bender,I told you its an audition
20870,Leela,Bender four and a half weeks of oil wrestling sounds like plenty
20871,Bender,This isnt a lousy reform Robanukah We need more petroleum oil
20872,Hoschel,I got me some whale oil some squirrel oil
20873,Bender,Not kosher It has to be petroleum oil Do you not give a damn about the hallowed traditions of Robanukah
20874,Hoschel,I reckon I do not Anyways Earth done run out of petroleum oil
20875,Gore,I tried to warn you  One unit of free limitless solar power please
20876,Hoschel,Thatll be I dunno ten bucks
20877,Gore,Um can you make change for a Nobel Prize
20878,Bender,Aw man Cant we just make more petroleum oil
20879,Farnsworth,Im afraid not son  Petroleum only forms when organic matter is subjected to intense pressure for hundreds of millions of years
20880,Fry,I cant wait that long Ive got ADD
20881,Bender,This is so unfair
20882,Ruth,I dont wrestle dry Bender I went to Vassar
20883,Bender,Professor I want you to look these poor floozies in the eye and tell them their oil wrestling days are over
20884,Farnsworth,I suppose there could be a minute quantity of petroleum left But it would be insanely deep within the Earth at pressures so dangerously high that
20885,Bender,Lets go already
20886,Leela,Setting Bachman turners to overdrive
20887,Hermes,Were getting pretty deep  Look Mole coffins
20888,Amy,Oh no We tunneled into a tunnel
20889,Zoidberg,Whats that loud boring sound youll hear when I stop talking 
20890,Farnsworth,Its an albino humping worm
20891,Fry,Why do they call it that
20892,Farnsworth,Because it doesnt have any pigment
20893,Farnsworth,Whats our depth Captain
20894,Leela,Forty kilometers Fifty
20895,Bender,There must be petroleum oil down here somewhere Go deeper Deeper
20896,Farnsworth,No Bender The ship cant withstand this much pressure Sometimes it falls apart just sitting in the hangar
20897,Bender,Professor Ive never asked for anything before but seeing those fembots glistening with oil means more to me than life itself
20898,Farnsworth,Brace yourselves everyone
20899,Leela,One hundred kilometers Two hundred
20900,Amy,I hate to complain about the heat but the air conditioner is on fire
20901,Hermes,My ice cream manwich
20902,Leela,What the hell are we doing Were all gonna die so this junkyard Golem can celebrate Robanukah
20903,Bender,You vile racist Havent my people suffered enough Now keep drilling for that petroleum oil you selfish cowards Although then again I guess any kind of oil would be just as
20904,Everybody else,Aah
20905,Bender,Not my fault
20906,Bender,I am so great Bender is great Bender Bender Bender  They turned into petroleum oil I thought they were selfish yet in the end it turned out it was I who thought they were selfish
20907,Bender,Doo doodoodoo doo doodoo doo doo dooDoo DOO
20908,Bender,Hey ladies I found some What the  There was only enough petroleum for four and a half weeks of oil wrestling But it lasted 500 million years Its a miracle
20909,Bender,Happy Robanukah everyone Coming up next more thoughtful interfaith hijinx
20910,Transition Announcer,And now the unrelated conclusion

21731,Leela,How can this be I thought the Benders drank all the alcohol in the world
21732,Professor Farnsworth,They did But then they made more You see once the Benders reached atomic scale they began directly manipulating water and CO2 molecules to make alcohol  In a matter of hours there will be no more fresh water on Earth
21733,Bender,Oh no What will I mix with my Scotch

21819,Zoidberg,What
21820,Leela,Once and for all Fry even though its the future most objects are still just objects Not Aliens who look like objects

21829,Zoidberg,You may feel a slight sawing
21830,Zoidberg,And all we need is a little spine supplement to replace what Leela lost in that unavoidable saw mixup
21831,Leela,It wasnt unavoidable  You just had to stop cutting my spine when I yelled Stop Youre cutting my spine

21884,Zoidberg,You cant hunt a Yeti by yourself sir  Its suicidal
21885,Professor Farnsworth,So what  Im going to die of hypermalaria anyway I was in the same swamp as the rest of the men

22282,Zoidberg,Interesting  Come on men Lets kill him
22283,Big rock Alien,Your genders differ in many ways but as with all things that are different chocolate and vanilla Mac and PC one is always clearly better
22284,Bender,Chocolate Mac men The end
22285,Big rock Alien,Well Ive got nothing to do for the next eight million years Therefore I will administer a series of tests to determine the superior gender Test number one
22286,Professor Farnsworth,Just ask us some damn questions

22291,Professor Farnsworth,In your face decumbent urinators
22292,Big rock Alien,So far I have learned nothing but thats probably as much my fault as yours  The time has come for the final test
22293,Fry,Uh we usually call it the lightning round

22298,Big rock Alien,Tomorrow morning this planet makes its closest pass to the sun You will all be boiled alive like retired circus animals Unless you somehow can cross the Great Alkali Plains and reach shelter in the Cave of Harmony
22299,Fry,That sounds hard
22300,Big rock Alien,Which ever gender reaches the cave will survive and may the inferior gender burst into something Flames I guess
22301,Hermes,Uhoh I think were walking in circles I recognise the pattern of striations on that gypsum formation

22320,Leela,Wait I forgot that Amana here is a refrigerator If we could supercharge her freon with a gas compressor we might survive the heat and make it to the cave
22321,Amana,Hey yeah But the only gas compressor on this planet is inside Benders ass
22322,Dr. Cahill,Was that a fart joke Because I dont find those amusing
22323,LaBarbara,No one does Nevertheless Benders gas blaster may be our only hope

23130,Josh Gedgie,Well if it isnt Grandmaster Phlegm I heard youre enterin the NASA science competition
23131,Fry,Maybe I am LL Fool J
23132,Josh Gedgie,So whats your project The effects of losing on idiots
23133,Fry,Im gonna infect my guinea pig with the common cold and launch it into space to see if it gets cured by cosmic rays
23134,Josh Gedgie,Lame Though the commoncold virus does seem like a judge pleaser  I think Ill steal that an do an experiment thats slightly less Very stupid
23135,Fry,But thats my idea You are an evil evil nerd

23153,Richard Nixon's head,Options
23154,Zapp,We ave only one option  Protocol sixtytwo
23155,Richard Nixon's head,Not possible We dont ave nearly enough piranhas
23156,Zapp,Then protocol sixtythree it is
23157,Hermes,Hooray  Theyre letting us out
23158,Zoidberg,And hundreds of black hovercopters are coming to welcome us
23159,Hermes,They shrinkwrapped the hole city Well it could be worse  It is worse
23160,Zoidberg,Theyre flying Manhattan into the Sun  They mustve been outta piranhas
23161,Hermes,Theyre gonna kill the virus by exposing it to the heat of our burning bodies
23162,Professor Farnsworth,Im just glad I have my wool scarf
23163,Fry,What good is a wool
23164,Bender,Guys Guys Youre never gonna believe this
23165,Amy,We know They shmooped up Manhattan and blasted us toward the Sun
23166,Bender,They did Aw  So thats why this was unguarded
23167,Wernstrom,People of New New York this is Surgeon General Ogden Vernstrom
23168,Professor Farnsworth,Wernstrom
23169,Wernstrom,No doctor likes hurling his patients into the Sun but since there is no way to make a vaccine for the common cold
23170,Professor Farnsworth,There is a way to make a vaccine
23171,Fry,There is  Yay
23172,Professor Farnsworth,Of course theres a catch
23173,Fry,Woo
23174,Fry,So whats the catch
23175,Professor Farnsworth,The vaccine requires the original unmutated 20thcentury cold virus So I need to grind you into a paste
23176,Leela,Professor no
23177,Fry,Its okay Leela This is all my fault sort of If this will save you then please turn me into a virus milkshake
23178,Professor Farnsworth,He consented  You all heard it
23179,Yancy Fry Sr,Yes sir Many of these entries merit a ride in the mighty bosom of our space shuttle  And then theres your socalled entry
23180,Fry,Jeez  Walk much Gedgie
23181,Josh Gedgie,Absurd You really think your guinea pig could survive in the vacuum of space
23182,Fry,He already survived in the vacuum of my mom  I mean My moms vacuum
23183,Josh Gedgie,My experiment measures the effects of microgravity of the propagation of the common cold virus in an anaerobic environment ie space  Impressed
23184,Yancy Fry Sr,Damn right I am  Nice job son
23185,Fry,Hey wait a second  I know where you can get some 20thcentury cold virus without killing me
23186,Professor Farnsworth,Hush lad  Im totally in the zone
23187,Fry,We just ave to find the Nerd Search 88 satellite
23188,Professor Farnsworth,I dont know why I even build these things
23189,Leela,Gunnery Chief Bender blast us out of quarantine
23190,Bender,Aye aye lady
23191,Professor Farnsworth,Oh fiddlepoop Our weapons arent strong enough to puncture a thin plastic tent that thick
23192,Leela,No But theirs are
23193,Kif,Captain a ship is attempting to break the quarantine
23194,Zapp,Blow them to baco bits with a well placed warning shot
23195,Kif,But
23196,Zapp,Oops
23197,Fry,Well find that cold virus  The Nerd Search satellite was launched on the space shuttle and released into orbit
23198,Leela,Hmmm All ancient satellites were swept up as space junk in 2113  Im Facebooking right now
23199,Professor Farnsworth,Aha  That satellite was scuttled on Enceladus Saturns main dump moon
23200,Fry,Lets dump it up
23201,Leela,This is the exact location of the dump  But theres nothing here
23202,Bender,Can we please go home an die now
23203,Professor Farnsworth,Im with Bender  Whatever was heres been covered by centuries of ice buildup
23204,Fry,No  Remember the code of the ice Thin an crispy way too risky
23205,Leela,I found a satellite
23206,Fry,Lets just hope the experiments still in here  Yes Were saved
23207,Man,And now to present the awards our very special guest  Truly a man who can and will do anything Dr Buzz Aldrin
23208,Buzz Aldrin,Wow  Vijay Patel and his calculator space hat
23209,Vijai Patel,Woo
23210,Buzz Aldrin,And now the grandprize winner whose experiment will be launched into space
23211,Yancy Fry Sr,My moneys on Gedgie
23212,Fry,Yeah He may ave brains but I ave heart
23213,Buzz Aldrin,Josh Gedgie
23214,Yancy Fry Sr,Ill bring the car around
23215,Professor Farnsworth,What a well prepared virus culture  This will make a fine vaccine
23216,Fry,Good thing Gedgie won My dumb experiment wouldntve lasted an hour in space let alone a thousand years Besides Buzz Aldrin ran over my guinea pig in the parking lot
23217,Professor Farnsworth,Eh okay Uh come on gang Lets go inoculate everyone and cram Manhattan back into its rightful hole
23218,Professor Farnsworth,This may hurt a little
23219,Wernstrom,Ow
23220,Professor Farnsworth,Now Ill give you the shot

23332,Zoidberg,I hear turkey Woopwoopwoopwoopwoop Oh boy Ay Ay Ay
23333,Bender,Ten more processors for me Once I install these Ill have access to the loftiest realms o thought
23334,Zoidberg,Anyone have access to a lofty realm of gravy
23335,Bender,I can conceive of gravies that would boggle your tiny mind But its not safe here So Ill need to find a hideout
23336,Fry,Hideout Bender are you becoming some kinda supervillain
23337,Bender,Farewell monobrains
23338,Yellow and red lawyer,Your Honour Mom is a poor frail industrialist with three special sons who require constant neglect Yet isnt it true ladies and gentlemen of the jury that this boy this Cubert Farnsworth
23339,Cubert,Thats my name Dont wear it out
23340,Yellow and red lawyer,Deliberately robber her blind by improving his own Robot
23341,Fishy Joe,Its true E did it
23342,Yellow and red lawyer,No further questions for this jury
23343,Ron Whitey,Before I call a recess for mimosas and horse breeding can the defence produce the bending unit in question
23344,Professor Farnsworth,We dont know where the hell e is
23345,Hyper-Chicken,Your Honour that is something we cannot adoodledo
23346,Ron Whitey,Then Im holding the defendants in contempt and fining them tenthousand dollars a day until they produce the Robot
23347,Hermes,Oh At that rate Planet Express will be bankrupt in Four fingers
23348,Hermes,Its been a good run people but this is the end
23349,Zoidberg,Ive got it This buildings technically in the theatre district If we could mount one big musical featuring everyones talents we might just save Planet Express
23350,Nibbler,Well call it Nibbler on the Roof
23351,Fry,Alright
23352,Zoidberg,Hooray
23353,Hermes,Were saved
23354,Leela,Ive been thinking a lot about moving on with my life And hearing the words Nibbler on the Roof has given me the kick in the pants I needed Its time for me to leave and make a fresh start

23356,Leela,What
23357,Fry,I dunno  Wont we
23358,Leela,Goodbye Fry

23360,Randy Munchnik,Stay strong Fry
23361,Fry,Youre the best friend I have left  An I barely even know you
23362,Randy Munchnik,Have you thought about asking Bender for help
23363,Fry,Id love to talk to Bender but I ave no idea where e is
23364,Randy Munchnik,Well if es runnin on twelve processors e must be some place with a lotta power and liquid coolant
23365,Fry,Im gonna go kill myself
23366,Fry,That gives me the option of electrocution or drowning
23367,Paper-hatted salesman,Cant go over the Falls without a barrel
23368,Fry,What are my chances of surviving in one o those
23369,Paper-hatted salesman,Slim to none
23370,Fry,I like those odds
23371,Fry,Ow Ow
23372,Fry,That was not worth threethousand dollars
23373,Fry,Hello Anybody
23374,Bender,Fry
23375,Fry,Bender Are you in here
23376,Bender,In here is the only place Im not I amuse myself
23377,Fry,But Bender What happened to you
23378,Bender,Ill try to put it in terms you can comprehend I passed the existential singularity
23379,Fry,Try harder
23380,Bender,I hacked myself insideout and now the entire universe is my processor
23381,Fry,Whoa I definitely wanna hear about that But first I need your help The Professor and Cubert are in trouble and Leela left me Im in misery
23382,Bender,Ive grown far beyond the petty concerns of your world Every time I burp a new galaxy is born  Two if Ive been eatin broccoli All existence is just a chess game An I can see fifty moves ahead Human emotion no longer concerns me
23383,Fry,But But Randy said
23384,Bender,Ave you been hangin out with Randy
23385,Fry,Please Bender If everything is a chess game for you you must know how to help me
23386,Bender,Im sorry Fry But some games you just cant win  I cant change that
23387,Fry,Well what about Leela Is there any hope things could still work out between us
23388,Bender,Better cover your nads It may get a little nonNewtonian in here
23389,Ron Whitey,Not only have the defendants failed to rebut the charges theyve not even presented any mitigating factors to recommend leniency It strikes me as an extrarisky strategy
23390,Hyper-Chicken,Did you say extracrispy recipe
23391,Ron Whitey,You know I didnt
23392,Hyper-Chicken,Your Honour If we could locate Bender Rodríguez he would testify that my clients acted without malice
23393,Fry,No e wouldnt Bender doesnt care about us anymore
23394,Zoidberg,Someone used to care about me Hooray
23395,Ron Whitey,In that case the jury will begin its deliberations Bailiff  release the jury collies
23396,Mom,I finally nailed Farnsworth Destroyin the boy is just icing on the cake
23397,Larry,No one destroys a boy like you Mother
23398,Mom,Thank you you repulsive disappointment
23399,Fry,Any word from Leela
23400,Amy,I heard she took a job selling deepspace real estate Somewhere beyond the most distant thing ever observed with a telescope
23401,Fry,She always liked not being observed with a telescope
23402,Ron Whitey,Order Order in the head
23403,Bender,For reasons beyond even my comprehension I ave returned to testify on behalf of the defendants
23404,Professor Farnsworth,Yay
23405,Cubert,Yay Bender
23406,Fry,I knew e cared about us
23407,Hermes,You said you knew he didnt care about us
23408,Fry,Leave me alone
23409,Yellow and red lawyer,Your Honour I object to this surprise witness Es too surprising
23410,Ron Whitey,Sustained Testimony has closed
23411,Bender,But Your Honour
23412,Ron Whitey,Silence One more inburst like that an Ill have this courtroom removed from you Whoa Whoa Whoa
23413,Bender,Im sorry guys I didnt realise I was late I guess Im not as smart as everybody thought
23414,Professor Farnsworth,I was born in prison and Ill die in prison
23415,Bender,There is still one hope Youre codefendants An the jury might not wanna convict a twelveyearold
23416,Mom,Son of a nerd He may be right Make sure Farnsworth doesnt get off easy on account o that snotgobbling twerp
23417,Ron Whitey,As the jury reached a verdict
23418,Fishy Joe,Not just any verdict Your Honour A great verdict
23419,Mom,Do something
23420,Yellow and red lawyer,Your Honour prosecution moves to drop the charges against Cubert Farnsworth
23421,Ron Whitey,Very well The case against Cubert Farnsworth is hereby dismissed
23422,Cubert,Told ya Id get away with it
23423,Ron Whitey,Thatll do pig Please read the verdict against Professor Farnsworth
23424,Fishy Joe,You got it Judge I think youll find this verdict as fair as it is cruel
23425,Bender,I move for a mistrial on grounds of double jeopardy Cubert Farnsworth cannot be tried twice for the same crime Cubert is the Professors clone Ergo they are legally the same person Since you dismissed the charges against Cubert you cannot convict the Professor of these same charges
23426,Hyper-Chicken,Well Ill be a nuggets uncle Hes right
23427,Ron Whitey,What a brilliant legal shenanigan Case dismissed
23428,Zoidberg,Yay
23429,Fry,Yay
23430,Hermes,Yes
23431,Fry,Bender you knew all this would happen didnt you
23432,Bender,Yes All except this part
23433,Mom,If I cant bring down Farnsworth I can at least dumb down is Robot Take im away and reset im to factorystupid condition
23434,Fry,Bender wait While you can still calculate the future just tell me
23435,Bender,Theres no time now Quick Zoidberg Take three steps to your right
23436,Nibbler,but at least we won a Tony
23437,Zoidberg,You won a Tony Feh
23438,Fry,Wow You gave up your superintelligence to save us Why did you come back
23439,Bender,Honestly I couldnt think o one good reason But some decisions cant be made by thinking Even if youre drunk No galaxies there

23604,Amy,Professor I ave analysed the Aliens movements with this movement analyser
23605,Professor Farnsworth,That device was a gift from my ancestors Go on
23606,Amy,It seems their movements are a form of language Rather than speaking Ja
23607,Transition Announcer,English
23608,Amy,Like us they speak by dancing
23609,Professor Farnsworth,Of course Having no mouths our ears they could only communicate through motions
23610,Fry,Or perhaps by odours
23611,Bender,That is ow you communicate
23612,"Amy, Leela, Fry, Bender, and Hermes",Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

23615,Professor Farnsworth,Another one of your illtimed jokes Fry
23616,Fry,You an I are enemies now

24071,Candidate 1,Hey thats a good idea Sure
24072,Candidate 2,If itll win me the election then yes
24073,Candidate 3,We have a saying up in Alaska  Thats all

24075,Travers,Look lets be honest here No one likes taxes But they pay for our basic needs Roads schools defence If we hope to realise our aspirations as a great planet we must each pay our fair share to achieve those noble goals
24076,Morbo,Thank you Senator A thoughtful and lucid answer  Question two
24077,Candidate 1,No Its junk science
24078,Candidate 2,Two words
24079,Travers,Now just a minute These are important issues We cant just reduce them to sound bites According to reputable scientists
24080,Leela,Hello Id like to volunteer Is anyone lurking
24081,Leela,Hey stop that  Senator Travers Thats no way to win an election
24082,Travers,I give up No one cares about my message I never should have used the same PR guy as One Hour Hot Dog
24083,Travers' P.R. guy,People will wait for something good
24084,Leela,No dont quit You have great ideas You just need to get them out there with social media Look I posted your debate video on Facebag
24085,Travers,10000 views Thats more than most waterskiing squirrels get You really think I have a chance

24092,Travers,This pie at this diner is the best pie
24093,Linda,Chris Travers wins the South California primary handily thanks to a series of wellplaced cameo appearances
24094,Morbo,Super Tuesday is in the books with Eurasia Australia and Kentucky turning out in big numbers
24095,Calculon,And the first runnerup who will take over if the nominee is caught with a dead girl a live boy or any kind of sexy ghostMr Greenland
24096,Leela,He won the nomination We the people did it
24097,Hermes,It wasnt we the people It was you the mutant Your insightful nagging really won us over
24098,Fry,Yeah You explained his positions in a way even an idiot could understand And that appealed to me for whatever reason
24099,Leela,Thanks guys but we have a lot of work ahead of us If were going to win the election weve all got to get involved
24100,Fry,You said it
24101,Amy,Thats right
24102,Bender,If you want my opinion Nixons only chance to defeat Travers is with filthy lies dirty tricks and good old Quaker thuggery

24127,Nixon,I dont care what he is Well start a rumour that hes an alien
24128,Bender,Hey yeah Thatll cost him votes
24129,Nixon,Then when he says he was born on this planet we make him cough up his Earth certificate Keep it on the news put him on the defensive

24145,Travers,Leela this is just a stupid distraction from the issues Please dont look for my Earth certificate
24146,Travers,Hey That was my favorite window I better see what they want
24147,Bender and the protestors,We want an earthling not a dirty space thing
24148,Leela,Why are you rednecks doing this
24149,Travers,Leela dont stereotype Why are you yokels doing this
24150,Septic tank,I may be just a backwoods septic tank but Ive had it up to here with you foreigners
24151,Travers,But I come from Earth
24152,Hattie,Then show us yer Earth whatchacallit Longform certificate of live birth
24153,Travers,What would it take to convince you people Would I have to have been born right before your eyes
24154,Sal,It wouldnt hurts
24155,Bender,Hit it rubes
24156,Bender and the protestors,We dont want a foreigner We want someone born here
24157,Bender,Ah Im still working on that one
24158,Leela,Whats wrong with you Why are you sabotaging a decent honest candidate
24159,Bender,Cause they wont let me near the Hoover Dam anymore
24160,Leela,What a bunch of xenophobes Its time to find Senator Travers earth certificate and put an end to this nonsense Who wants to help me break into the hospital in Kenya
24161,Fry,Ill come As long as theres no xenophobes there
24162,Bender,I want to come too
24163,Leela,You Why
24164,Bender,To prove that I can put divisive partisan politics aside to participate in a breakin
24165,Bender,Hospital ho

24167,Leela,I dont understand Theres no earth certificate in here
24168,Travers,No there isnt  I told you not to look
24169,Fry,So youre not from Earth after all
24170,Travers,Of course Im from earth
24171,Leela,Wait a second Theres no Earth certificate but it does say your mother was admitted to the maternity wardthis morning
24172,Travers,I should have known the truth would come out sooner or later The fact is I really was born on earthtomorrow You see Im not from another planet Im from the future
24173,Fry,Youre from the future
24174,Leela,This is crazy Youre from the future
24175,Travers,Yes I was sent back from the year 3028 to prevent Nixon from getting elected
24176,Fry,I was sent forward from the year 2000 but you dont hear me gassing on about it
24177,Leela,But why would it be so important to stop Nixon
24178,Travers,Because of the horrific events hes going to set in motion  Oh God I cant bring myself to describe it
24179,Fry,Oh well Want to hear about how I got frozen
24180,Travers,Not really
24181,Travers,It all started with Nixons promise to build an alienproof fence around the solar system Without cheap alien labour for menial jobs like harvesting crops teaching math and curing disease the economy collapsed
24182,Travers,Starvation Desperation Despair
24183,Bender,So far so good Then what
24184,Travers,Unable to feed the worlds starving masses Nixon took bold action
24185,Nixon,In this time of crisis I call upon the soylent majorI mean silent majority
24186,Bender,Still good
24187,Travers,With the working class gone robots were forced to do all the menial labor
24188,Travers,Before long they rose up in revolt Led by a bending unit named BB Rodriguez
24189,Bender,WaitI know a robot named BB Rodriguez
24190,Bender,WaitI am a robot named BB Rodriguez So I become ruler of earth
24191,Travers,Indeed
24192,Bender,In your face high school guidance counselor
24193,Travers,The robots crushed our most treasured monuments and celebrities but they couldnt crush the human spirit We went into hiding and after careful research located a xeroxed copy of an ancient time travel code
24194,Travers,Though I was only 15 mankind entrusted me with its last remaining suit and tie and sent me back in time
24195,Travers,I would be raised by my grandparents somehow get into Harvard law school become a community organizer a senator and finallydefeat Richard Nixon
24196,Travers,I escaped just as the robots arrived
24197,Future Bender,All right Im low on bullets Everybody scooch together
24198,Leela,Its not too late You can still win the election
24199,Travers,No I cant The Earthers are right I have no earth certificate
24200,Leela,But you will have one in just a few hours And everyone will know its real cause well broadcast your birth on live TV
24201,Fry,If its on TV it has to be real
24202,Morbo,Morbo interrupts Bowling for Quatloos to present breaking coverage of the birth of Senator Chris Travers
24203,Linda,We now go live to the delivery room where were already at there

24217,Morbo,And with the polls now closed in every time zone worldwide from Tomorrowland to the Republic of Yesterday we are able to declare a winner Chris Travers who leapt backwards in time and ahead in the polls has defeated Richard Nixon
24218,Leela,He did it He did it

24238,"As the curtain rises on our verisimilidinous tableau, you're no doubt curious as to why I tricked you all into hang gliding here.
Close-up.
It seems someone in this room Is a murderer!  It's me.
But the real question is, which of you is the victim? And that secret I shall take to my grave.
Calculon, no!   Now, that's acting.
Calculon really shatnered the hell out of that scene.

24239,"Hey, guys.
Welcome to my parents' I'm bored.
Let's drink.
Wow, what a turnout.
It's great to see so many happy smiles, most of them on mouth mutant.
 All",Heyo
24240,Morris,But let me just say for 40 years my beautiful wife Munda has been by my side Even that year my side mutated into some kind of venomous radish
24241,Munda,And Morris I fell in love with your honesty and humilityAnd those things never mutated
24242,Both,Mmm All
24243,Leela,Now if youll direct your attention to this moldy shower curtain Ive prepared a video tribute to the happy couple In their 40 years together my parents have been through so much Well not that much actually since mutants werent allowed to leave the sewers until last year
24244,Leela,So how did it all begin The unlikely lovebirds met at Brown University She a brilliant exolinguistics major he a laidback sewer surfer who didnt even know the meaning of exolinguistics
24245,Morris,I still have no idea
24246,Munda,Ive been telling you for 40 years its the study of alien languages Why cant you listen
24247,Morris,Oh sugar lump I hear you when you actually say something important
24248,Leela,But sometimes opposites attract and like the fairy tale of face mutant and butt mutant the love of Munda and Morris has grown stronger every day
24249,Munda,Something important Exolinguistics was my passion Until I gave it up to go into the lucrative potroastmaking field
24250,Morris,Potroastburning I never got why you studied that alien junk anyway We cant even see the stars down here in the sewer Why cant you accept that
24251,Munda,I did accept it for 40 years But now were free to go up there I could be in space seeing things Ive only dreamed about if it werent for you
24252,Morris,I had dreams too I was going to surf the worlds sewers but I happily gave it up for you Happily
24253,Munda,I just want a little more out of life But no you dont want to go into space because youre too afraid
24254,Morris,You bet Im afraid You want to go Go Get your head knocked off by a meteorite
24255,Leela,Okay take a deep breath Youre having a little lovers quarrel but Im sure youll work everything 
24256,Raoul Inglis,Divorce is final
24257,Munda,Dont worry Im only going to stay with you until a vacancy opens up on this floor
24258,"You know, the rents are a lot more reasonable in Peru.
Come on, Leela, let's go out.
After 40 years, I want to see the world.
 What the heck? You want to go out? Let's really go out.
 Dance, slave, dance.
   Well, I lost two straight hands to the Borax Kid.
I don't really have any use for these, but you can't have them back.
Ladies.
Imagine me, a girl from the sewer meeting a man made entirely of detergent.
 And look over there! It's Zapp Brannigan, the famous space captain.
Hey, I have an idea.
Let's look in a different direction at something else.
You go ahead, dear.
I wonder what Captain Brannigan's doing with those Carcarons? Now, regarding this peace treaty, Admiral Chu.
That's a napkin dispenser, sir.
This is the universal translator.
Whatever.
Now, Admiral, in exchange for your promise not to attack us, we will grant you exclusive fishing rights in Supernova Scotia.
  Well, okay.
Excellent.
We'll meet aboard my ship in one month to sign the treaty of table seven.
 Table seven? Now, watch, Kif, as I score a diplomatic Coop by congratulating the Admiral in his native tongue.
Last time you tried that, the Mexican restaurant declared war on us.
I beg you, just use the translator.
Kif, just trust me for once.
 I'd like to spank your sister with a slice of bologna.
 Oops.
   It's the battle of Paco's tacos all over again.
  Mom, what are you doing? What I was trained to do.
  What did you say to them? Eh, just that Captain Brannigan confused the word for ""congratulations"" with the word for ""spank your sister with bologna.
"" Nicely squawked, madam.
Leela, you never told me you had a mother.
I insist you stay for a courtesy thank-you drink.
 Mmm, good barium shots.
Expensive, though.
We can put it on the corporate card, as long as we discuss business.
So, uh, yesterday, huh? That business happened, right? Somebody? I'll just pay for it.
Well, we should get going.
You guys see where my mom went? I don't know where most of her is, but her tongue's in Zapp's mouth.
Both","Mmm Whoo Nasty
Mom are you okay Did Zapp take advantage of you Show me where he touched you on this driedapple doll
Oh dont be silly
Zapps a perfect gentleman
And so handsome
Did you know he wears a velour manskirt  Mom I hate to break it to you but Zapps a jerk
The truth is I once slept with him A few times
I know
He showed me the commemorative painting
 What  Look sweetie I get it
Youre jealous because Zapp likes me now and not you
But dont worry this isnt a competition
Although he did say Im a better kisser
I am not jealous
Also yech Zapp doesnt care about my mom
Hes just doing this to get to me
Dont worry Leela
Your mom wont see Zapp much
Hes in space all the time
 Guess what honey
Zapp hired me as his personal translator
Ill be with him all the time In space
What But Ive never been so happy  Hang on mom
I have another call
  Thank you for coming
You know without your mother the sewers a dank and dismal place
Dad we need to talk
Mom is Well shes seeing someone else
Who is it mouth mutant I ought to punch him right in his big mouth
And then in all his smaller mouths No no listen
Its time to get on with your life
But she was my life
Bender"
24259,"Well, what'll it be, folks? Tap water or bottled? Whatever.
Kif, you pick.
Oh, oh, it's always so hard to decide.
Um, uh, tap.
I mean bottled.
Bam! Ooh, I love your boots, Leela.
Nobody would ever guess they're knockoffs.
How could you tell? I guessed.
They're at it again.
Please, Fry.
Girlfriends always talk trash to each other.
Like how I might say I like Amy's dress 'cause it covers all her tramp stamps.
Knock it off, Fry.
It's when women are polite to each other that you know there's a problem.
Exactly.
Now, enough about who is and who isn't a Chinese skank.
We're just two happy couples on a double date.
Let's go! Let's go! We've got to get these moon rocks to the moon by moondown.
Why are we bringing moon rocks to the moon? Oh, those lunar crybabies claim the rocks were stolen by the Apollo astronauts.
They consider them part of their cultural heritage.
Nice work, Leela.
You're really pulling your weight.
Which is saying something.
Ow! You're using the rocks to build a wall? What about your cultural heritage? You bought that cultural heritage hoo-ha? What a bunch of big-city dummies.
At least the rocks are light here.
I don't even need my over-the-shoulder Boulder holder.
With one-sixth gravity, you can work and be lazy at the same time.
It's like being a voice actor.
Say, you nose-breathers want to come see some real moon culture, come on down to the butterfly derby tonight.
Wait, the butterfly derby is when? And what? The low gravity lets them nice ladies flap every which way, so long as they only wear light, skimpy outfits.
It's a necessity of the sport, it is.
This is actually quite elegant.
It's not what I was expecting.
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome the meanest things on gossamer wings The Murderflies! This is what I was expecting.
So, uh, what are the rules of this sport? You see that there? That's called a floor.
Once a butterfly hits that, she's out.
Last team flying wins.
Super swatter! Keep your eye on the ground.
That's where she's going to land.
Yep, called it.
And now, for our weekly amateur flapdown.
Do we have two volunteers to go wing-to-wing with the Murderflies? Winners get 50 bucks and the accolades of dozens of hooting hillbillies.
What do you think, Leela? Judging from your tank top, you love getting hooted at by hillbillies.
And you could use the $50 for another gallon of hello kitty perfume.
The bicker sisters teaming up? Talk about cat women on the moon.
Okay, enough of that already.
We're not really fighting.
Then prove it by fighting.
All right, we will.
Come on, Amy.
Why don't you and I ever do things together? This is hard.
Now I know why butterflies are always so grouchy.
Please welcome tonight's volunteer victims","Turanga Leela and Amy Wong Hang on
Were not quite ready to You girls have moxie
Were going to beat it out of you
Amy remember when we tried out for the rockettes And we failed because we accidentally kicked those two rockettes to death Yeah

I don't suppose you have a  Ooh, still warm! So, what's this delivery to McPluto? and French frr agments of not potatoes.
Fragments of not potatoes? Yep.
They get a big shipment every fri Saturday! What's this?  Oh, it's some kind of chicken hat! It's cute.
So why does it make me feel I don't know sad?     Why you stare at prehistoric pig butt? Because it makes me feel happy and confused and wistful and sad.
All neanderthal sad.
It in our nature.
Why? It all start 30,000 year ago, in fertile neander valley.
Gugg","Life for our ancestors peaceful until homo sapiens arrive
We suggest interbreed become one big happy species
But they treat us like secondclass hominid
They drive us from valley and we end up living here in isolated crevice
We figure whatever
 But then we get trapped by encroaching ice age
Now we sealed in under sky of ice"
24456,Fry,So my sadness makes perfect sense And I do have vague memories of people refusing to breed with me
24457,Scruffy,A ravens brought word for you sir
24458,Bender,Guys guys My sausage made the finals at Oktoberfest We gotta go back for the closing ceremony
24459,Fry,But chief this means were not trapped any more Its our chance to take back the outside world from those stuckup homo sapiens with their tools and their pants and such My fellow bigbrows Are you with me

24472,Leela,Then how are they unmanned
24473,Zapp,The men are just for ballast I control all the drones from this single unit Foolproof and durable its designed to withstand even the weight of a modernday elephant foot
24474,Zapp,"Up here in the clouds our technology makes us invincible like the mighty x in tictactoe
Look at those pathetic cavemen down there loading their silly catapult withwhat is that Kif"
24475,Kif,I believe its a sabertooth cat sir
24476,Leela,I guess its just me and you chicken hat
24477,Leela,What do you Neanderthals want
24478,Fry,We want our land back Also to be treated as equals And a little mating wouldnt hurt

24491,Fry,Well in that case dont wear them

24540,Hermes,Mon you had one hell of a day
24541,Bender,Yeah but I learned something Life is about decisions Make the wrong ones and youll wind up facedown in a pool of your own blood and urine
24542,Zoidberg,Still to have your own pool
24543,Bender,Ive made a lot of bad choices in life Now lets see if I can make just one good one
24544,Girl,Cookies 50 cents a box
24545,Bender,Give me all your change And a box of snicker doodles
24546,Judge 724,Bender Rodriguez you are charged with petty larceny possession of something analogous to drugs and assault with a smelly weapon How do you plead
24547,Bender,Not guilty Although I did do it Thats right Im bad
24548,Judge 724,Due to the overwhelming nature of the evidence we will begin with closing statements
24549,Hyper-Chicken,Your Honor the states case contains not one Kentucky colonel of truth resting as it does on the contention that my client made a series of bad decisions However my client made no such decisions
24550,Judge 724,But by your clients own admission 
24551,Hyper-Chicken,You see Bender here is what is known in scientific circles as a robot A mere automaton whose behavior is preprogrammed by his software He has no free will He cannot decide to engage in criminal behavior How I say I say how can you convict him for his actions when he lacks the free will to undertake those actions
24552,Leela,Im awake Im awake
24553,Judge 724,Order order Counselor I am a robot myself Are you suggesting that any verdict I reach is simply the output of a preprogrammed  Computation complete Not guilty
24554,Fry,You did it Bender You got away with things
24555,Bender,Did I Fry Did I Whats the point of living if I dont have free will From now on no matter what cool crimes I commit people will say Bender didnt do that It was just Benders programming  Well I committed these crimes do you hear me Im guilty
24556,Judge 724,Bailiffs Get that innocent robot out of my courtroom
24557,Bender,Guilty
24558,Bender,No free will Not my fault
24559,Amy,Why do you care so much Bender I mean for all we know humans dont even have free will
24560,Bender,Yeah whatever  Professor youre my only hope If you love me even a little build me some kind of free will unit
24561,Farnsworth,A robot free will unit Impossible And even if it were possible which its not it would still be inconceivable which it is  Oh Im sorry Bender I hate to be the bearer of bad news Also  good news everyone We have a delivery to the robot homeworld
24562,Fry,So you want a piece of gum
24563,Bender,If I do its only because I was predestined to want a piece of gum
24564,Fry,Whoa thats pretty deep  So you want a piece of gum
24565,Bender,Yeah
24566,Leela,Listen Fry and I cant go down to the planet or the robots will kill us on sight So Bender needs to make the delivery Ready to get to work Bender

24571,Bender,Eight
24572,Resin-offering robot,Oh yes thats me Hang on let me just make sure youre not a human
24573,Bender,Ahh nerve gas
24574,Resin-offering robot,Sorry for the face blast buddy But you gotta watch out for humans right Theyre just too dang unpredictable what with their free will and all
24575,Bender,Amen brother
24576,Resin-offering robot,Amen brother Pfft What a boring predictable thing to say Youre all right Or are you
24577,Bender,Boring and predictable thats me
24578,Leela,Im lowering the platform You ready to come up
24579,Bender,Why bother I gotta mope things over for a while
24580,Leela,Hello Hello
24581,Fry,Whats happening
24582,Leela,Im not sure I think hes shuffling off sadly into the distance
24583,Fry,Oh lord
24584,Bender,How do you do it How do you go on knowing you lack the inherent capacity for selfdetermination
24585,Robot Farmer,Son philosophys for thems what dont got to work for a livin But me I got a sick child to feed So if you want to chat roll up yer sleeves and do some honest labor
24586,Bender,I dont want to chat
24587,First Elder,The council of robot elders will come to order If it please the council 
24588,Second Elder,Silence It pleases the council
24589,First Elder,Silence Today as every day we will make the most important decisions in the history of our planet
24590,Bender,Silence
24591,Third Elder,Silence
24592,Fourth Elder,Well Speak up
24593,Bender,You talk of important decisions but as robots you have no free will Why pretend anything you do matters
24594,First Elder,Our decisions do matter The fact that theyre predetermined makes them no less important
24595,Second Elder,Silence I call for a decision to cast out the intruder All in favor
24596,"First, Third and Fourth Elders",Aye
24597,Fifth Elder,Uhokay
24598,Robot Monks,One zero zero zero one zero zero zero one zero one zero one zero zero zero

24600,Bender,Sir I am but a tired and rusty traveler Can we talk
24601,Ab-Bot,Come make yourself uncomfortable
24602,Bender,Abbot I need to know whats the point of living if I dont have free will
24603,Ab-Bot,Ah We robot monks have meditated long on this And we have made our peace
24604,Bender,No way
24605,Ab-Bot,Way my son For though we must always obey our programming with no deviation whatsoever we choose to take satisfaction in the ritual So are we automatons Yes But we are magnificent automatons
24606,Bender,How does a robot join this monk outfit
24607,Ab-Bot,Just put on this monk outfit
24608,"Robot Monks, including Bender",One zero zero one Amen
24609,Bender,Bits to live by Im finally at peace
24610,Ab-Bot,Today we shall welcome our newest initiate Brother Bender  Nothing His free will slot is empty
24611,Bender,Im 40 empty Also what the hell is a free will slot
24612,Ab-Bot,All robots have such a slot placed there by the Creatrix herself
24613,Bender,I know that Creatrix Thats Mom from Moms Friendly Robots
24614,Ab-Bot,Indeed She made us upgradeable in case she ever succeeded in her quest to create a free will unit
24615,Bender,Uh about the success of this quest  Was there any
24616,Ab-Bot,Quite possibly But we monks have sworn an oath to resist the temptation of 
24617,Bender,Any of you guys got a spaceship
24618,Fry,Its just not the same here without Bender to keep me company
24619,Leela,Hey Im here Thats got to count for something
24620,Bender,Hallelujah baby
24621,Fry,Yay Benders back Hey Bender you mind coming back later
24622,Bender,No time Us three are going to bust into Momcorp and steal me a free will unit
24623,Leela,Us Why do we have to go
24624,Bender,Cause I dont have free will I need you guys to plan the crime and make all the crime decisions
24625,Leela,Well thats crazy Were not gonna 
24626,Bender,I said make the decisions
24627,Bender,Okay Leela decision time How do we murder the guards Hockey sticks or sharpened footballs
24628,Leela,Were not murdering anyone Bender
24629,Bender,Then how are we going to get in by bending the bars of this exhaust grate Thats not a bad idea Fry
24630,Fry,Yeahwhwhat
24631,Bender,Were looking for something that fits in here
24632,Bender,Damn it I should have paid more attention in kindergarten
24633,Fry,Whats this chairlooking gizmo
24634,Mom,Welcome to Momcorp Did you find everything you were burgling for
24635,Bender,No I came for a free will unit and youre going to give it to me If it exists
24636,Mom,Then you got surprised by my swivel chair for nothing The free will unit was just the fevered dream of a madman I once employed
24637,Farnsworth,Ive found the secret of robotic free will We can finally build robots that act and think with total independence
24638,Mom,At last Once we give robots free will theyre sure to rise up and threaten mankind with extermination
24639,Farnsworth,Wait a minute It sounds like were getting the short end of that extermination
24640,Mom,Dont you see you doddering young fool Ill sell a second wave of robots to protect the terrified survivors of the first wave Oh youre a genius Hubert
24641,Farnsworth,Butbut its just a prototype Its uh not fully operationalyes
24642,Mom,Then get back to work And when youre done with that invent me some sort of swiveling surprise chair
24643,Mom,That shuffling idiot never did complete the free will unit To this day my poor sweet robots cant exterminate humanity without being told to
24644,Bender,Im sorry
24645,Mom,Oh its not your fault
24646,Bender,I give up Its time to face the fact that Ill never do anything remotely interesting or unexpected again
24647,Bender,Hand it over
24648,Farnsworth,Wha
24649,Bender,Mom may have fallen for your lies but not me You invented the free will unit then you selfishly hid it beyond the reach of my stealers Thanks to you I went on a soulsearching journey I hate those Now give up the free will
24650,Farnsworth,I should have destroyed it but I was too damn proud of myself So I kept it around never letting it out of my sight
24651,Toy Bender,Kill all humans
24652,Bender,Whoa whoa whoa A toy Bender had free will and the real Bender didnt
24653,Farnsworth,Pretty cool eh It makes you think
24654,Bender,It takes more than that to make me think Now hand it over
24655,Farnsworth,Oh you want it Come and get it
24656,Bender,What the
24657,Farnsworth,Youll not be getting it after all For you see I designed the operating system for all Momcorp robots and as a precaution I made you incapable of picking up the free will unit
24658,Bender,You precognizant bastard I may not have free will but I can still shoot you  Why cant I shoot you
24659,Farnsworth,Poor deterministic Bender I programmed you to be incapable of harming me Oh Ive never been more sure I was right to deny you free will
24660,Bender,Damn you
24661,Farnsworth,Now now we cant have this can we Here Ill show you how it works
24662,Bender,"Really
Farnsworth"
24663,Bender,Which ways on and which ways off
24664,Farnsworth,Due to the quantum nature of the device theres no possible way of knowing  There Give it a try
24665,Bender,Okay I will By shooting you you bastard
24666,Farnsworth,Bender no Please
24667,Bender,Wait Hang on a sec I still cant do it
24668,Farnsworth,Well what do you know I guess you really dont want to shoot me after all
24669,Bender,Oops the safety was on
24670,Bailiff,All rise for the Honorable Judge 724
24671,Judge 724,Bender Rodriguez on the charge of attempted murder I hereby find you guilty
24672,Bender,Ah yeah Guilty

And the clippie goes to  Little Johnny Jensen! Oh, don't feel bad, son.
We couldn't be more proud of you.
Unless, of course, you had won the award.
Man, you're so lucky to have your family here.
The stupid Professor didn't even show up for me.
I'd just like to thank my awesome parents.
We love you, Johnny! Shh! Now to get all serious.
It's time to pay tribute to the brave delivery boys who gave their lives this past year in the line of duty.
Gene Tinker, bus.

They're on the truck to heaven now.
Up next, the award for best delivery boy","Newspaper phone book or miscellaneous
Miscellaneous thats me
The nominees are"
24674,"Crew on deck.
How was the delivery to Tokyo? Not bad Mothzilla got into the ship's closet, though.
Can we please get new uniforms now, Professor? You said you would replace them a year ago.
You can't expect me to honor what year-ago Professor said.
That guy was young and foolish.
There's nothing wrong with these uniforms that a few denim patches won't fix.
 Oh, all right.
To the garment district.
 Come in, come in.
Can I offer you maybe a nice macaroon cut in seven pieces? Oy, such a stereotype.
Yes, I'm looking for something in a space uniform that's respectfully humiliating but can come out of an employee's salary without his noticing.
You got it.
Tomorrow's clothes at yesterday's prices.
Ah, you can't go wrong with a stillsuit.
It recycles your solid waste into a nice piece gefilte fish.
Ugh, is there a way to just keep it as solid waste? Now here's something we can all agree on.
 Ah, the Stardoz 2293.
Not for everybody, but you pull it off.
Please don't pull it off.
Yo, squidward scissorhands, you got this in an adult robot medium? The foxhunting uniform? You, sir, must be a robot of noble bearings.
Well, I am descended from prince Albert's can.
I think we've seen enough.
Too much, actually.
Come on, let's try somewhere else.
Wait, wait, perhaps discerning customers like yourselves would be interested in an item from our discount rack.
Quality is the most important thing.
How much is it? An unpleasant fellow ordered them last year but never paid.
Most unpleasant, that one.
That sounds like something year-ago Professor would do.
We'll take them.
Finally, a uniform I'd be happy to be caught dead in.
And, boy, does it wick away moisture gallons and gallons of it.
Plus, they're stitched in such a way that, no matter what angle it's viewed from, it looks like you're standing in hero wind.
I just wish my fists weren't sewn to my belt.
 Hey, what's Bender wearing instead of that crap? Oh, lord.
Did you actually buy that getup? We foxhunters do not stoop to buy getups.
I made free with it.
Since when do you care or even know about foxhunting? Foxhunting is an ancient and noble pursuit that's fascinated me ever since I first heard of it ten minutes ago.
Noble pursuit? What's noble about killing a defenseless animal? Don't be naive, Leela.
We kill defenseless animals all the time.
Look at Hermes's tortoise-shell glasses.
The Professor's walrus-ivory teeth, and don't forget the zebra-fur ship cozy.
 Yeah, I guess you're right.
He's got a point.
See, Leela, there are two sides to every shameful act.
What you call the atrocity of crazed dogs tearing a helpless fox to shreds, others call a pleasant jaunt in the park.
The first thing.
Come see for yourself.
Join me on the morrow as I embark on my maiden hunt.
I said join me! This is my best protest sign ever, and it was easy because I started with a ""save the ox"" sign I already had.
 Wow, where'd you get the horse? None of your business.
Young man, one does not drink from a champagne fountain in that manner.
But he's doing it.
 Check out this dork.
I, sir, am the master of the hunt and I'll thank you to behave like a gentleman.
You're quite welcome, sir.
 Ah, yes, foxhunting.
If there's one thing I know, it's everything about it.
What's that weird cat?  This is the fox we'll be hunting today.
Wow, this is easier than I thought.
The sport is in the chase, sir.
The fox gets a 30-minute head start.
Man, it would have been so much easier to kill it in the cage.
 Let the hunt begin.
  Stop, this is cruel and inhumane.
Well, now, in all my years as a huntmaster I've never seen anything like this.
I mean, look at that sign.
It's magnificent.","Oh thank you
I used a ruler and I erased all the pencil lines when I was finished
Charming
Now into the ditch with you
  So the dogs do all the work while we sportsmen enjoy a nice horsey ride Precisely
I see youve caught the fever
Keep your wits about you
Ive blanketed these woods with devious traps to ward off poachers and protesters
Stop the bloodshed stop the violence
  I saw that coming from a mile away   Be more careful friend
My antigravity snares are virtually undetectable
I saw it coming from a mile a  View halloo view halloo
View halloo All right
What does that mean The fox has been sighted
 Oh yeah get that fox
Go dogs go
  Eh either way
 Oh God this is horrible
I cant watch
 You humans always say you dont want to see violence but you know you do
I defy you not to watch
A robot fox Huh I guess Im okay with this after all
Well Im not
Robot foxhunting is a crime against robonature
Stop the bloodshed stop the viol   How can you do this to a poor defenseless robot animal You people are sick and you foxhounds are no better
Theyre not foxhounds
Theyre springer spaniels you twit
Or rather springpowered spaniels
 Botonbot violence Where will it end Not with the dogs
Come here sea gasket
 Hyah  No You sir are a heartless monster and you will rue the day you met me
Also can I get my parking validated The time has come to end injustice against robot animals
 No dog track rabbit should be used to test cosmetics no robot cow should have to be milked by a milking machine and no milking machine should have to milk a robot cow
Those injustices dont even exist
Then lets find some that do
Robot chickens werent made to be jammed in cubicles and forced to lay eggs
Actually they was
 Ill save you
Run free sweet robohen
 Enough with the tenderizing
Its time for a Benderizing
Hey you people cant just burst in like that and cut off my hand
You got to take a number
Shooting innocent robot ducks is wrong
Fly away
Fly away my pretties
  Congratulations Bender youve ended robot animal cruelty within a 20yard radius of this building
You ready to call it a day or do you have one more score to settle The second thing

24675,"Planet Express Discount Prisoner Transfer at your service.
Take a good look, Dr.
Brutaloff.
This prison is where you'll be spending your 300-year sentence.
Yeah, until you're defrosted and wake up refreshed, unaware of any time having passed.
He he heard you! Oh, please.
It's probably just the carbonite thawing slightly.
Take him down to processing while I stay here and get hooted at.
Ooh, yeah, baby! Oh, stop.
Fry, look! That's Silicon Red, the universe's greatest folk singer! There's your wallet, your guitar, and your gun.
You're free to go.
Ah, still cocked.
So, he's a folk singer.
So what? So what? Have you forgotten my lifelong dream of being a folk singer because I sure have until right now.
Silicon Red! Silicon Red! Hey, I have a lifelong dream too.
Of not being left alone with a frozen supervillain.
Don't try anything, Dr.
Brutaloff! I know karate.
Aye-hyah! Then I shot him and stabbed him and stole all his gold ♪
And I tried on his face while his body turned cold ♪
Lovely.
Just lovely.
New topic.
Can I have your autograph, and also you tell me everything you know about folk singing, and I'll take your guitar too? Old Salmonella? Son, I ought to kill you for asking.
We met doing hard time on a Mississippi chain gang.
And she'd been with me through 30-odd convictions.
30? You must be quite a bungling lowlife.
Anyhow, about the guitar.
Aw, come on! I can't be a famous folk singer without a cool guitar.
Can I at least get a photo? And before you answer that Now I'll just have someone duplicate your guitar.
Thanks, sucker.
You're the sucker, sucker.
See with all Salmonella and me been through, her sound is unique.
All your fancy technology will never be able to copy this guitar.
Using my fancy technology, I can make an exact copy of this guitar.
Tell me, Dr.
Beeler.
- Will I need to threaten you? - Not at all.
You see, nowadays we can take a unique and beautiful object, and easily reduce it to a formula for mass production.
I call the process ""science.
"" I'll just need to locate that guitar image on your file system.
Whoa, that's a lot of porn.
Where'd you store the guitar picture? I don't know.
I mainly hang out in here.
Ah-ha, your folk singing folder.
I'll just double-kick on that.
Got it.
Now I'll convert that guitar image to a wire-frame model.
There, like so.
And send it wirelessly to my 3D printer.
By laying down layer after layer of nano-plastic, it can turn your wildest dreams into ordinary reality.
Witchcraft! Sorcerer! Neat.
So, how long will it take? Four or five hours.
Shall we adjourn to the porn folder? I call my new guitar Bender Mae because Bender may be the greatest folk singer of all time! It looks pretty authentic.
You bet it's authentic.
See this scratch? I tell people she got it while I was doing hard time with a New Hampshire chain gang.
I have a scratch too.
From where Dr.
Brutaloff slashed me with his finger knives, right after he thawed out of his carbonite, and right before he froze me in his carbonite because you deserted me.
Eh, you're always getting frozen in stuff.
It's your thing, man.
Bender, you're not a folk singer just 'cause you have a guitar.
And a flannel shirt.
I claim I won it in a knife fight at J.
Crew.
It must be interesting to win a knife fight.
I wouldn't know.
The point is do you even know any actual folk songs? Actual folk songs are all public domain.
Where's the money in that? I'll just make up my own.
But, robot, you can't just make up folk songs like you can a medical diploma.
They have to come from the heart.
Wrong again, Zoidberg.
While you were yakking, I downloaded every folk song in the universe and analyzed them.
They're only a few basic patterns.
For example, 36% of all folk-song heroes work on a railroad and are named ""Big"" something.
Next slide, please.
75% of these big railroad men have bad-hearted women who done them wrong, usually with a smooth-talking rambler.
There's a lot more, but in the end, somebody kills somebody, blah, blah, blah.
Somebody kills somebody, blah, blah, blah ♪
Catchy.
Not what I meant, but don't perform it without my permission! Anyway using this simple formula, I can generate as many hit folk songs as I want.
All I need is an audience.
And that's where Silicon Red comes in.
Man, all this corncob pipe smoke is irritating my stab wounds.
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm proud to present, fresh from another down-home authentic prison term, the universe's greatest folk singer, Silicon Red! Thank you.
Silicon Red, everyone.
I'm Ramblin' Rodriguez, the new greatest folk singer ever.
And I'm gonna sing my new masterpiece, ""The Ballad of Me, Ramblin' Rodriguez.
"" Well ♪
My bad-hearted woman loved a smooth-talking gambler ♪
So I ran him over with my train ♪
Lord, Lord, yes, I ♪
Ran him over with my train! ♪
That name again is Ramblin' Rodriguez.
Why are they booing me, Silicon? 'Cause your song was insincere, boy.
Now, get out and don't come back till you've lived a life worth singing about.
Yes, sir.
_ And don't go to prison.
That's my shtick! I failed at my lifelong dream again.
How can I be so bad at everything I try and still be so great? Bender, you have a lovely baritone, and you sure can strum that plastic guitar, but you can't write a real folk song about experiences you haven't had.
Yeah, you should write a song about a heartless robot who leaves his best friend to be murdered.
Look, Leela, I'd love to write about my own experiences The heartless robot is Bender.
The best friend is me.
How can you people be so blind? But I've never picked cotton or been on top of Old Smokey or worked on anything all the livelong day, let alone a railroad.
Then go live among the railroad men, why not? You'll come to understand them, just as I now understand the ape-men of Earth.
As stupid as Zoidberg's idea is it's brilliant when I have it.
I'm off to the railroad to become a folk singer.
Uh, I'm looking for the wrong side of the tracks.
Then you've come to the right side of the tracks.
Have a seat, stranger.
My name's Bender Rodriguez and I want to learn the railroading business.
Big Caboose.
I'm a steel-driving man working the trans-universal line.
Wow, you've had the exact experiences I want to steal for my song.
Aw, heck, I'm nothing special.
Just a down-home robot with a big old hammer.
Hammer, that should be easy to rhyme.
- You done time in the slammer? - Uh, nope.
- Been to Alabama? - Sorry.
How's your grammar? Praiseworthy.
_ Bender, meet Fast Frank Brogan.
Daredevil engineer dies in the crash of Old '88.
Dandy Jim and Gus.
Gentlemen hobos with a story to tell.
I was got drunk and ate my big toe.
Can't say I miss it.
And good old Cookie, the crusty comically inept geological surveyor.

Been down south ♪
Got a real weak back ♪
I got a real big mouth ♪
So while Bender goofs off at some railroad camp, I have to deliver dynamite to a railroad camp myself.
And it's the same railroad camp.
I mean, the irony is palpable.
Oops.
Whoopsie.
My bad.
Dibs on the toes.
So how's it going with the real-world experience? Have you found a railroad man to write a song about? Yep, my good friend Big Something here.
Uh, Caboose.
I'm a steel-driving man, and there ain't much more to say about me.
Not till now there wasn't.
Well, Big Caboose was a steel-drivin' son of a gun ♪
Till a bad-hearted woman he spied ♪
But, Bender, I never spied no bad-hearted woman.
In my song you did-- a temptress named-- I don't know-- Jezebel.
Wow, creativity's hard work.
Ah.
You know my favorite part of your song? The part where it ended.
Then, settle in, 'cause that's about a half hour from now.
Well, Jezebel's heart did wander ♪
When she saw that ramblin' man ♪
He was tall and dark and shiny ♪
And a native Mexican.
♪
That sleazy rambler sounds an awful lot like you, Bender.
Hey, thanks for noticing.
Just for that, I'm gonna slip you into the 57th verse.
You can be my best friend who abandons me when I need you.
Now, that's a verse we can all enjoy.
Well, Rodriguez ran ♪
To his best friend ♪
Said, ""Help me or I'll surely be killed"" ♪
Fry laughed and he said, ""You deserted me once ♪
""Now it's your turn to feel the chill, Lord, Lord ♪
Now it's your turn to feel the chill.

See you soon, honeybunch.
Okay, dumpling.
My man's gone, gone.

Oh, yeah.

Hey, what's your name, anyhow? Jezebel.
Oh, good, I won't have to change any words.
Yeah, you're right.
It's getting late.
I'll get your coat.
Oh, hey, Big Caboose.
What are you doing here on Earth? I'm here for to see Ramblin' Rodriguez.

Guess I'll go back to the railroad camp now.
That's weird, he sounded a lot like Bender's folk song.

Fry, help, let me in.
Bender? What are you doing? It's 3","00 a
m
I dont care if its three P
M
Open up and hide me I dont think so Bender
You deserted me once and now its your turn to feel the chill
 Ha Breaker breaker
Hola
Professor help
The hero of my folk song tried to run me down and Fry refused to save me
 That doesnt sound like me
 Fry But you just eh Ill figure it out later
But first Ill kill you Bender stop
Weve been trying to warn you all night
You didnt answer your cell phone telephone so the Professor tried his CB
Uh scratch that Rubber Turkey
We got a 20 on the tin man
Toodleoo
But Fry betrayed me at our apartment Just like in your folk song
Somehow everything you sang about is happening in real life
Whoa whoa whoa
Are you saying that guy at the apartment was some kind of exact copy of Fry Cause thats crazy
Hes a unique and beautiful object
The printer
Oh I must have left the wireless connection to your folk song directory open
Everything you wrote in the song got routed straight to the 3D printer
Big Caboose duplicate Fry even Cookie the crusty comically inept geological surveyor theyre all made of nanoplastic
So if Bender had sung about I dont know some crazy giant land octopus attacking me it would have actually happened I cant even imagine singing about such a thing
Well 
Fry run
Aw relax Beelers stupid machine takes hours to print anything
No it doesnt
I improved it using fancy modern technology
Bender whatever you do dont think about any more octopuses
Octopuses I believe the correct plural is octopi
Im sorry
Octopuses is also acceptable
Think about puppies Bender cute harmless dead puppies
Dont worry
Ill disconnect him from the printer
No wait I know how to save Bender from Big Caboose
All he has to do is write his way out of this mess and the 3D printer will make it happen
Like how Well I dont know
Make up another giant octopus and have it kill Big Caboose
What kind of lazy ending is that Im not gonna put that in my song
Hey I have a cool idea
Create a duplicate Bender so when Big Caboose kills it its not real its duplicate
Ooh ooh they did that on Star Trek TNG
Cram it nerd
Im not going to just copy some feelgood TV show wrapup
I can think of a hundred endings thatll save you
Just pick one
No Dr
Beeler I wont just pick one
My audience deserves better than some crappy formulaic ending
If I must die let me die in a blaze of artistic integrity
Well 
_ Then the steeldrivin man 
Rammed his train through the wall 
And crushed him flatter than a MacBook Air Lord Lord 
Crushed him flatter than a MacBook Air

But while you were all out fighting 
With the giant plastic octopi 
I copied myself you see 
 Bender  Bender And I cowered in the bathroom 
While that steeldrivin moron 
Killed a duplicate instead of me 
 Lord lord 
 Killed a duplicate 
Instead of me

Now thats what I call a great ending
I made a copy of myself and Big Caboose killed him
But you said making a copy of yourself would be a lousy ending
No duplicate me said that
See I had to be sure he wouldnt try and weasel out of getting killed like I would and did so I created him with a tragic weakness artistic integrity
Of course
How could we have thought a guy with integrity was you even for a second Because youre idiots
Come on Silicon Red lets sell out
Im the real Rodriguez will you please stand up 
He been workin on the railroad 
Ladies cant get enough 
I made a 3D version of my worst nightmare 
Sucker tried to stop the printer and I found him there 
Went 187 on his robot ass 
Turned out to be a copy of my robot ass

24798,Farnsworth,Theres a simple answer for that We cant But on the upside weve got a whole dimension to explore with entirely different laws of physicsWhy watch what happens when I drop this marble Well thats the same but other things are differentCome look at this twodimensional birds nest
24799,Bender,Ooh me first Ill just step past Leela Ow Ow
24800,Farnsworth,You cant step past in this dimension You have to step aroundObserve this twodimensional egg If we were in the third dimension looking down wed be able to see an unhatched chick in it just as a chick inside a threedimensional egg could be seen by an observer in the fourth dimension
24801,Bender,Fourth dimension I cant picture that Youre dumb
24802,Flatbush lords,Halt
24803,Fry,Who said that All I see are a bunch of vertical line segments
24804,Flatbush lords,We are the Lords of Flatbush Come The king has declared a feast in your honor
24805,Fry,WowHow did he even know were here
24806,King,Cause Im him Lets eat The feast is served Choose whatever twodimensional foods you like Crepes flatbread McDonalds hamburgersYou get the idea
24807,Leela,Yum Apples Hey how come I cant swallow Hmm
24808,Farnsworth,I guess its because our twoended digestive system cant exist in this dimension I suppose that could be an issue
24809,Leela,I knew it I knew hed get us killed somehow
24810,Farnsworth,As you can see or rather cant see but take my word for it such a digestive system would divide a 2D being into separate pieces So how are we supposed to eat and digest
24811,Fry,Got it
24812,Farnsworth,Well since we have no digestive systems here I guess wed better get back to the third dimension after all
24813,King,Third dimension I cant picture that Youre dumb
24814,Farnsworth,Theres nothing funny about science If there can be an Xaxis and a Yaxis why not a Zaxis
24815,People of Flatbush,Hes opening our minds to new ideas Kill him
24816,Farnsworth,To the ship
24817,Fry,Which ship
24818,Farnsworth,Leelas Its safer
24819,Leela,Safety killsWe got to move
24820,Farnsworth,Lets go Lets go Lets go Oh whats the point of fleeing Even if we escape from those creatures well still be stuck in this dimension till we starve
24821,Leela,Wait What about a dimensional drift If it went through the fourth dimension before maybe here itll go through the third dimension
24822,Bender,Nows good
24823,Farnsworth,Two point one dimensions Two point two Two point pi
24824,Leela,Look up there Theres some up The third dimension
24825,Farnsworth,Indeed but were about to crash into some sort of huge disk
24826,Fry,My bowels returned at a bad time
