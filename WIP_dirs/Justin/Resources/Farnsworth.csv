168,Who are you?
170,I don't have an Uncle Fry.
172,"By God, I am your nephew! This is absolutely incredible!"
174,"Oh, my, no."
175,Let me show you around. That's my lab table and this is my work-stool. And over there is my intergalactic spaceship! And here's where I keep assorted lengths of wire.
177,I designed it myself. Let me show you some of the different lengths of wire I used.
183,I suppose it is technically possible. Though I am already in my pyjamas.
185,Can anyone drive stick?
195,Three.
202,"Not necessarily. Are you three, by any chance, interested in becoming my new spaceship crew?"
204,Of those poor sons of -- but that's not important. The important thing is I need a new crew. Anyone interested?
207,"Oh, that won't be a problem. As luck would have it I saved the chips from my previous crew."
209,"If by that you mean ""transporting cargo"" then yes. It's a little home business I started to fund my research."
211,You will be responsible for ensuring that the cargo reaches its destination.
213,Exactly!
217,As new employees I'd like your opinion on our commercial. I paid to have it air during the Superbowl.
219,"Not on the same channel, of course."
227,"No, no! That was all just special effects! Now let's have breakfast. I hope everyone likes eggs."
230,"Ah, Hermes! Crew, meet Hermes Conrad. He manages my delivery business, pays the bills, notifies next of kin, what have you."
232,"Oh, my! I haven't picked a new captain yet. It's always so hard to choose."
233,"Hmm, you!"
243,"Now Fry, before you go into space you'll need to see our staff doctor. I should warn you though, he's a little unusual. (whispering) He wears sandals!"
245,"Dr. Zoidberg, this is Fry, the new delivery boy. He needs a physical."
247,You'll be fine.
253,"Dear Lord, Bender, you're filthy."
255,"Amy, why don't you give his body a going over with the cleaning pick?"
260,"As soon as we finish cleaning Bender. Oh, and Fry, this is our intern, Amy Wong. She's an engineering student of mine. (whispering) I like having her around because she's the same blood type as me."
268,"Ah, to be young again. And also a robot! Now as I recall you youngsters have a package to deliver."
411,"Oh, dear! I really ought to do something. But I am already in my pyjamas."
450,"Oh, fuff! He's not causing any trouble. Now, if you don't mind, I'm rather busy. I seem to have mislaid my alien mummy. This sarcophagus should contain the remains of Emperor Nimballa, who ruled Zubin 5 over 29 million years ago."
452,"My God, this is an outrage! I was going to eat that mummy! Fry has got to go!"
536,"Oh, how awful. Did he at least die painlessly...? To shreds, you say. Well, how is his wife holding up...? To shreds, you say. Very well then.  Sad, sad, terrible, gruesome news about my colleague, Dr. Mobootu."
553,"This is for you, Fry  Zevulon the Great. He's teriyaki style."
567,Fix it!
588,Obviously your thoughts are being transmitted on the same frequency.
613,"Right, so long."
733,"Yes, let's all talk about Leela's personal life later. But right now we have business to attend to."
735,No. A tax-deductible mission of charity.
737,This is Vergon 6.
739,"It's a sunny little doomed planet, inhabited by a number of frisky little doomed animals."
741,"That's right. Animals in desperate need of rescue. You see, Vergon 6 was once filled with a super dense substance known as dark matter, each pound of which weighs over ten thousand pounds."
743,"Well, dark matter is extremely valuable as starship fuel. That's why it was all mined out, leaving the planet completely hollow."
745,The wha?
747,"I didn't say anything about animals. Now it seems that the planet will collapse within three days. Incidentally, this will kill all the animals."
952,Baseball? God forbid!
968,"Oh, yes!"
975,"He's good, alright. But he's no Clem Johnson. And Johnson played back in the days before steroid injections were mandatory."
985,"Oh, dear Lord!"
987,It's...my...new pager.
989,"I'm sorry, wha?"
994,"Great news, everyone. You'll be delivering a package to Chapek 9, a world where humans are killed on sight."
996,"I'm glad you asked that question, Fry. You see, Chapek 9 was colonised centuries ago by a murderous crew of radical robot separatists."
999,They're not fans.
1011,"Well then it's settled. So long, everyone!"
1211,"It's very simple. The ad gets into your brain just like this liquid gets into this egg.  Although in reality it's not liquid, but gamma radiation."
1269,"I'm sorry, Fry, but the anchovy has been extinct since the 2200's."
1271,"Oh, my, yes. Fished to death. Just about the time your people arrived on Earth wasn't it, Zoidberg?"
1417,"Uh, wha? Oh, yes, they say madness runs in our family. Some even call me mad! And why? Because I dared to dream of my own race of atomic monsters. Atomic supermen with octagonal-shaped bodies that suck blood out of..."
1490,"Good news, everyone..."
1492,...you'll be making a delivery to the planet Trisol...
1494,...A mysterious world in the darkest depths of the Forbidden Zone.
1497,"Why, of course! Its just a name! Like the Death Zone or the Zone Of No Return. All the zones have names like that in the Galaxy Of Terror!"
1499,"Off you go, pleasant trip."
1675,"Good news, everyone. Tomorrow you'll be making a delivery to Ebola 9, the virus planet."
1677,Because tonight's a special night and I want all of you to be alive. It's the Academy of Inventors annual symposium.
1679,It's the event of the scientific season. Every member presents an invention and the best one wins the Academy prize.
1681,"Oh, my, yes. But not this year, because my latest invention is unbeatable. Behold! The death clock.  Simply jam your finger in the hole and this readout tells you exactly how long you have left to live."
1683,Well it's occasionally off by a few seconds. What with free will and all.
1686,"Oh, my, yes."
1688,"That's me at the very first symposium. I'm the Academy's oldest living member, you know. These youngsters all look up to me."
1690,"Why don't you just leave me alone, Wernstrom?!"
1692,You young turks think you know everything. I was inventing things when you were barely turning senile.
1695,A hundred years ago he was my most promising student at Mars University. But then after one fateful pop-quiz...
1697,I'm sorry but penmanship counts.
1699,And here it is: Slightly over 99 years later and still no revenge. I'm essentially in the clear.
1708,Let's just say it'll put you young whippersnappers in your place!
1710,"Uh, last year, you say?"
1712,"Oh, my! Did it put you young whippersnappers in your place?"
1714,"Oh, dear, I'll have to invent something new in the next ten minutes. Perhaps some sort of death clock."
1717,"Just a second, just a second."
1719,"Uh, yes, here I am, OK, now, hello there. Now, we all know telescopes allow us to see distant objects. But what if we want to smell distant objects? Well now we can! Thanks to my new invention...the Smellescope."
1721,"The odour travels past this coffee stain here, around the olive pit and into this cigar burn. And this appears to be a, doodle of myself as a cowboy. But the Smellescope is brilliant, I tell you! Think of the astronomical odours you'll smell thanks to me.  Oh, my!"
1724,Perhaps 149 is just too old to be a scientist.
1727,"By God, you're right! I'm going to build that Smellescope!"
1728,Eureka!
1730,"No, I remembered that I'd built one last year. Go ahead. Try it. You'll find that every heavenly body has its own particular scent. Here, I'll point it at Jupiter."
1732,Exactly! And now Saturn.
1735,"I'm sorry, Fry, but astronomers renamed Uranus in 2620 to end that stupid joke once and for all."
1737,"Urectum. Here, let me locate it for you."
1739,"What is it?  Oh, jeez! Oh, man! Remarkable! A stench so foul is right off the funk-o-meter. I dare say Fry may have discovered the smelliest object in the known universe."
1742,"Hmm, perhaps the computer can calculate its trajectory.  My God! Whatever it is it's headed straight for us. With enough force to reduce this entire city to a stinky crater. We have less than 72 hours."
1745,Ah! Just as I thought. The answer lies in this movie I found on the Internet.
1748,Actually that's still true.
1751,"So that's the situation. Due to the short-sightedness of Old New York, New New York is going to be destroyed by a giant ball of garbage."
1762,Please! There's no time for this now. This is an emergency. We must warn the mayor.
1764,"Very serious, Mayor Poopenmeyer."
1766,Wernstrom!
1768,"No, I'm here because a giant trash ball is heading straight for us. Smell for yourself."
1784,But suppose we send a crew to plant an explosive precisely on the fault line betwen this mass of coffee grounds and this deposit of America Online floppy disks.
1788,"Now, you'll only have one chance to destroy the ball. After that, it will be so close to Earth that blowing it up would cause garbage to rain over the entire planet, killing billions."
1790,"Now here's the bomb I've prepared. Once you activate it, you'll have 25 minutes to get away."
1792,"Now, now, there'll be plenty of time to discuss your objections when and if you return."
1815,"Oh, how could I have put that bomb timer on upside-down? I could swear I followed the manual precisely.  I'm a dried up husk of a scientist. This is all my fault."
1818,Wernstrom!
1831,"Wait! If we could build an object the exact size, density and consistency of the garbage ball, it might just knock the ball away without smashing it to bits."
1833,"Alas, I don't know."
1835,Good Lord! A second ball of garbage! That just might work!
1845,"If my calculations are correct, this garbage ball will knock the other garbage ball directly into the sun."
1848,"Five, four, three, two, three, four, five, six..."
1851,Burning garbage!
1854,"Yes! In your face, Wernstrom!"
1859,Exactly! It's none of our concern.
1915,"Good news, everyone! Today you'll be delivering a crate of subpoenas to Sicily 8, the Mob Planet!"
1948,Yes.
1975,If only he had joined a mainstream religion like Oprah-ism or Voodoo.
2072,"Oh, great news, everyone."
2074,In that case I'll have to hire a new crew to go on our company vacation.
2078,It's just my way of thanking you for not reporting my countless violations of safety and minimum wage laws.
2080,"I've booked us all on the maiden voyage of the largest, most luxurious space cruise ship ever built.  The Titanic!"
2092,"Ah, here's my stateroom."
2094,"Now, Hermes, you and your lovely wife LaBarbara have the suite through there. And Dr. Zoidberg, your marble tank is on the other side."
2096,It'll seem even nicer once you've seen your room.
2172,Ow!
2181,Though it did get me some action!
2206,"Wait, I'm confused. Now tell me, Fry, which one of these ladies are you involved with?"
2233,(shouting) I'm too young to die!
2264,Thank God there are plenty of escape pods; We won't have to dress up like women and children.
2272,I don't feel well!
2290,"Oh, yes, absolutely!  Not a chance!"
2295,"Good news, everyone.  We've got a very special delivery today."
2297,Me.
2299,"No, I need it shipped to my office at Mars University.  It's a little experiment that may well win me the Nobel Prize."
2301,"I don't care, they all pay the same."
2303,"Oh, my, no.  Off we go!"
2305,"Well, in those days Mars was just a dreary, uninhabitable wasteland, uh, much like Utah. But unlike Utah, it was eventually made livable, when the university was founded in 2636."
2308,Of course.
2309,Over here is Wong Library. It has the largest collection of literature in the Western universe.
2338,"That's true. By current academic standards, you're merely a high school dropout."
2344,Same thing I teach every semester: The mathematics of quantum neutrino fields. I made up the title so that no student would dare take it.
2346,"Please, Fry, I don't know how to teach; I'm a professor!"
2348,Oh!
2363,"Ah, Fry, I see you've met Guenter!"
2365,Guenter is my experiment. He was the top secret contents of this stinking crate.
2369,"Oh, please! That's preposterous science-fiction mumbo-jumbo. Guenter's intelligence actually lies in his electronium hat which harnesses the power of sunspots to produce cognitive radiation."
2372,"Please, stop bickering. I arranged that you be roommates for a reason: So I'd only have to remember one phone number. Now shake hands and make up."
2406,"And therefore, by process of elimination, the electron must taste like grapeade."
2408,Until 5pm?
2410,"Don't be jealous. Without his special hat, Guenter might be no more intelligent than you."
2412,"Fry, that monkey is my most important experiment. If you two don't stop fighting I'll have you both neutered."
2419,"Oh, I'm glad you made it, Guenter because in honour of parents weekend I have a special surprise for you."
2424,What's that they're flinging at us?
2444,"Look at him, I'm so proud."
2446,Not you.
2449,"Oh, I always feared he might run off like this. Why? Why? Why didn't I break his legs?"
2450,"(crying) Oh, poor Guenter."
2452,I'm afraid so. All he handed in was a paper smeared with faeces. He tied with Fry.
2454,You what? After I spent months slaving over a hot monkey brain?
2456,"But Guenter's obviously better off being intelligent. Tell him, Leela."
2458,What?
2460,What?
2469,Jungles? On Earth?
2471,Stand back.
2473,Don't worry. They'll be fine once the tranquiliser wears off.
2476,"Come on, Guenter, take the hat."
2478,Consider the philosophical and metaphysical ramifications of the--
2484,"Oh, dear Lord!"
2486,"Thank God this log is sturdy.  (shouting) Put on the hat, Guenter! You're the only one who can save us!  (muttering) Stupid monkey."
2489,Keep trying.
2493,We're saved!
2497,"Oh, that poor, sweet monkey. Well lets go gather him up. There's no sense letting him go to waste."
2500,"It seems to be working at only half-capacity, but I can fix it."
2502,But what about your super-intelligence?
2504,(screaming) Nooo!
2539,"Ah, here we are: Monument Beach!"
2545,"Come on, Zoidberg, I passed it right to you."
2551,"Eh ... wha?  Oh, oh, OK, I think there's one can left.  Oh, my."
2553,Like a cheap French harlot.
2574,"Oh, I should think so. Although last time aliens invaded all they did was force the most intelligent of us to pair off and mate continuously. (chuffed) Oh, yes!"
2621,"You'll be the captain, you'll be the delivery boy, and you'll be the alcoholic, foul-mouthed--  Oh, God, you're alive. I mean, thank God you're alive!  Sorry, check back in three days, a week at the most."
2645,(disappointed) I'm beginning to think there'll be no forced mating at all.
2648,"Well, Omicron Persei 8 is about a thousand light years away. So the electro-magnetic waves would just recently have gotten there. You see--"
2654,"No, there wouldn't be. Most videotapes from that era were damaged in 2443 during the Second Coming of Jesus."
2657,I have an old five-megawatt broadcasting tower in the attic.
2669,"Uh, (reading) Jenny McNeal, you are charged with jury-tampering in last week's case ...  ... on account of your hot, naked affair with the foreman. How do you plead?"
2674,"(reading) Your witness, Prosecutor Ramirez."
2683,"(reading) What say you, Single Female Lawyer?"
2695,"(reading) Miss McNeal, I'm afraid I must decline your offer of marriage. For, you see, I'm dying. Cough, then fall over dead."
2730,"According to Bender's temperature gauge, which I suggest you use next time, Leela, he's running a fever of ... 900 degrees."
2742,Or a big fat placebo. It's all the same crap.
2744,"It may well be the cause of Bender's illness. But more importantly, it's a flimsy pretext to try out my latest invention. To the laboratory!"
2745,"I call this the F-ray. It's like an X-ray only it allows you to see through anything - even metal. Now, the neutrino beam it emits is a tad dangerous, so you'll all need protective goggles. You may feel a slight stinging sensation - all of you-- All of you!  Aha! There's the cause of your illness."
2748,"Well, I've got to go take this suit to the decontaminators. You two lock up the F-ray and for the love of God don't let it fall into the wrong hands."
2781,"Oh, my!"
2783,Who are those horrible orange creatures over there?
2785,Tell them I hate them.
2842,Ooh!
2914,"Commissioner, my crew has made a horrific discovery: It seems that Slurm is produced in a colossal worm hiney!"
2918,"I'm not your grandpa, you're my uncle! From the year 2000!"
2925,(simultaneously) For Slurms!
2960,"Happy birthday, young Nibbler."
2991,"And so we say goodbye to our beloved pet Nibbler, who's gone to a place where I too hope one day to go: The toilet."
2998,"Actually, through the miracle of science, that can be arranged."
3002,I need to tinker in it.
3004,"Quiet, you. I'm installing an empathy chip."
3006,"Yes. If by ""allow"" you mean ""force""."
3008,"Oh dear, oh my. I got it. Once more."
3010,Steady now.
3012,There we go.  Now I'll simply tune it to Leela's emotional frequency.
3015,Hmm.
3057,"Oh, don't be so sure. Many scientists believe humans really could mutate down there. Uh, due to exposure to toxic waste and radioactive runoff and good old American faeces."
3157,That was a disgusting story.
3160,"Bender, you won't believe this, but the empathy chip burned out. The emotion you felt for Nibbler was actually your own."
3162,"No, I'm wrong. The empathy chip was running at triple capacity."
3165,So long!
3171,"Good news, everyone.  We have a mission to further the noble cause of intergalactic peace."
3175,It's a delivery for the Democratic Order Of Planets.
3177,"It's similar to the United Nations from your time, Fry."
3181,Tonight is the ribbon-cutting for the DOOP's new headquarters.
3183,Something without which no ribbon-cutting ceremony could proceed. The ceremonial oversized scissors.
3185,"Alright, but don't run with them."
3262,"Leela, who are you talking to?"
3264,"Why, you're that disgraced starship captain.  Having him on staff will distract people from our horrendous safety record. Come in."
3265,I'd like everyone to meet our new employees. (whispering) Which ones are new?
3267,"Hmm, I could swear I've never seen that robot before either."
3269,"Oh, yes, yes. My good friend, of course. Anyway, whoever you all are, I have good news. You'll be making a delivery to Stumbos 4, a planet with such high gravity you'll most likely be crushed under the weight of your own hair. Enjoy."
3383,(whispering) That a girl! If they don't take him back we can keep him as captain.
3386,"Oh, foo!"
3395,No time off.
3421,"But, like most politicians, he promised more than he could deliver."
3423,"Yes, that's a capital idea. Let's all go register."
3425,The very instant I became old.
3426,The problem with both parties is that they always want to give your tax dollars to the less fortunate.
3443,So what are you doing to protect my constitutional right to bear doomsday devices?
3445,"Damn straight! Today, the mad scientist can't get a doomsday device, tomorrow it's the mad grad student. Where will it end?"
3477,"Sold your body? Oh, Bender, I've been down that road. I know it's glamorous and the parties are great but you'll end up spending every dollar you make on jewellery and skintight pants."
3535,Don't you have a self-destruct button?
3612,I can't believe it. He won by a single vote.
3630,"Come on, everyone. Perhaps some skiing will help us forget the mouldy old antics of Conan O'Brien."
3660,Wha?
3663,What-mas?
3670,Eh wha?
3672,"Pine trees have been extinct for 800 years, Fry. Gone the way of the poodle and your primitive notions of modesty. Ah! Brisk!"
3674,"There, there."
3687,"Yes, and the only one of her species in all the known universe. What a lonely life."
3693,"You should be ashamed of yourself, Fry. You'd have to be blind not to notice that Leela's a cyclops."
3695,Oh?
3713,Good Lord! He doesn't know about Santa Claus.
3715,"Back in 2801, the Friendly Robot Company built a robotic Santa to determine who'd be naughty and who'd been nice and distribute presents accordingly. But something went wrong."
3717,"Wait, you fool! Due to a programming error, Santa's standards were set too high and he invariably judges everyone to be naughty."
3719,Nice meeting you.
3743,Huh? You were gone?
3799,"Oh, dear. They'll be killed on our doorstep. And there's no trash pickup until January 3rd."
3801,Quick! The armour-plated chimney cover! Push! Push!
3813,"Yes, good thing I got us out of that one!"
3830,"Merry Xmas, everyone!"
3869,"Now, now, this won't do. Let me just give old Zoidy a sedative."
3875,Mm-hm...  Oh-ho!  Aha! There's the problem.
3877,"Relax, my chiton-y chum. There's no problem. You're just heavy with male jelly."
3879,It must be mating season for Zoidberg's people. A chaotic time when his behaviour is dictated by the tiny brain in his rump.
3881,There's only one thing we can do...
3883,"...We, by which I mean you, will have to rush him to his ancient homeworld which will shortly erupt in an orgy of invertebrate sex."
4141,Do I hear wedding bells?
4143,"Really? Oh, dear."
4313,I still don't understand why you wouldn't let me graft a laser cannon onto your chest. To crush those who disobey you. But I guess we're just two different people.
4404,We did all we could.
4406,Good as new? Yes.
4407,"Leela, Zoidberg, the rest of you, this is Flexo."
4450,Everyone get in bed with me. I have something to show you.  Feast your eyes on this!
4455,"It's a single atom of jumbonium. And element so rare, the nucleus alone is worth more than $50,000."
4457,"100,000. That's why I hid it here. Under my mattress."
4459,Why certainly.
4460,"The atom sits atop this dime stored tiara which will be awarded to the winner of this years Miss Universe pageant on the planet Tova 9.  Your job is to deliver it, safe and sound."
4466,"Due to the atom's tremendous value, Planet Express would go bankrupt if it was stolen. Therefore we'll need to hire on additional security for the mission."
4469,Flexo's great you say? Well that's good enough for me.  Welcome aboard lad.
4585,"Good news, everyone. I've taught the toaster to feel love.  And Hermes returns from his vacation today."
4590,Yo!
4600,"Sounds great, Hermes! Whatever you say. (whispering) Let's ditch him and go to the movies!"
4614,Down in front!
4651,Aw. They don't make movies like this anymore.
4655,"There are no rules. Two robots enter, one robot leaves. Then later the other robot leaves after being declared the winner."
4657,"Oh, did I mention the crippling, agonising pain? I'm pretty sure I did. Oh, yes, definitely."
4728,What the hell are you talking about?
4747,"Oh, good. Just let me put on my reading glasses.  Why, Zoidberg, there's a lovely photo of you in here."
4778,Poor little guy starved to death.
4789,"Good news everyone! Several years ago I tried to log on to AOL, and it just went through! Wheee! We're online!"
4790,Go ahead! Get into these net suits. I designed and tested them myself.
4792,Really? I guess when you're around it all day you stop noticing. Off you go.
4826,"Everyone please sign off, we have a delivery. Plus I have to use the phone -  Leela please tell the others that -"
4957,Saving a race of one-eyed monsters? Who could object to that?
4990,"No harm done. In the many decades you'll work to repay me for that shipment of popcorn you destroyed, you'll have plenty of time to search for your true home."
5095,That's a full time job.
5131,"Oh yes we must, yes."
5134,You can't just waltz into the Central Bureaucracy. It's a tangled web of red tape and regulations. I've never been but a friend of mine went completely mad trying to find the washroom there.
5136,Oh I've been there. Lot's of times!
5142,Well it doesn't look like I'll make it inside with the rest of you. Uh but good luck. Just leave me where I drop.
5153,Wonderful.
5168,"Dammit Hermes, just jump already. Stop hogging that healthy liver."
5208,"Well, it looks like I'll be needing my heroic bureaucrat back. At severely reduced pay of course."
5215,"Good news everyone, the university is bringing me up on disciplinary charges! Wait, that's not good news at all."
5217,"Yes but they won't listen. Everyone's always in favour of saving Hitler's brain but when you put it in the body of a great white shark (sarcastic) ooo, suddenly you've gone too far."
5219,"Listen to me you pompous frauds, if I'm going down, I'm taking you all with me. Dean Vernon, I know the truth. It was you driving your hover-car that night, not your horse. Dean Epsilon, I know all about your ""Department Of Pool Boy Studies."" And Dr Wernstrom...Werrrnstrom!"
5224,"And you Coach Smalley, or should I say ""Coach hairpiece""?"
5226,(muttering) Hundred and...what? Oooh!
5235,Eh wha?
5237,"Uh, what a pleasure it is to see my lifetime of accomplishments summed up in a 3-minute film. My best years are behind me. So much left undone. So little time."
5239,My life is over.
5245,So many loves half-loved. So many inventions half-invented. That damn time machine alone set me back 15 years.
5247,"There's no one to carry on after I'm gone. No one to take care of my work and my research and my fabulous fortune. By God, that's it! I've got to name a successor."
5250,There's no time to lose. I'm off to my lab to build a successor-naming machine!
5261,"Everyone, I have a very dramatic announcement. So anyone with a weak heart should leave now. Goodbye."
5263,"Oh yes, the announcement! As you all know, I am not long for this world..."
5268,...So I've picked my successor. It's someone in whom I have great faith - even though his mind is undeveloped and he's accomplished nothing.  My closest living relative...
5270,"My clone, Cubert Farnsworth."
5275,12 years ago I began the cloning process by removing some skin cells from one of the shaplier growths on my back.
5277,I left him in his first tube too long and he got squished up against the side.
5279,Let's find out.
5293,"Oh Cubert, come in here. I have something amazing to show you."
5297,As my successor I'm trusting you to carry on my work. These are just some of the half finished inventions you'll spend your life finishing.
5299,"That's my prizewinning smelloscope. If a dog craps anywhere in the universe, you can bet I won't be out of the loop. And this is my universal translator. Unfortunately so far it only translates into an incomprehensible dead language."
5302,Crazy gibberish!
5304,Why certainly. Step over here.
5305,These are the dark matter engine I invented. They allow my starship to travel between galaxies in mere hours.
5307,Of course not. That's why scientists increased the speed of light in 2208.
5309,And what makes my engines truly remarkable is the afterburner which delivers 200% fuel efficiency.
5311,Not at all. It's very simple.
5313,Now that's impossible. It came to me in a dream and I forgot it in another dream.
5315,Nothing is impossible. Not if you can imagine it. That's what being is a scientist is all about.
5322,Oh it's a gem of an evening! I feel so wonderful having someone to take over my life work! And it's all thanks to Cubert.
5324,You...wha?
5326,But-But what about my hopes and my dreams and my wonderful inventions?
5331,"Bad news everyone. By the time you watch this tape, I'll be gone. Leaving by nothing but a history of failure and my original hipbones. You see, I've been lying about my age. I'm not actually 150. I'm 160. Oh vanity, thy name is Professor Farnsworth. And now that I've nothing to live for, I've alerted the Sunset Squad robots to take me away."
5332,"Goodbye cruel world.  Goodbye cruel lamp.  Goodbye cruel velvet drapes, lined with what would appear to be some sort of cruel muslin......and the cute little pompom curtain pull cords, cruel though they may be a -"
5413,Eh...whuh...
5419,I'm as spry as a 140 year old.  See? I only broke one ankle.
5421,"Oh, they had me hooked up to a bizarre virtual world that seemed absolutely real."
5423,"It was as though I was living in a facility in Florida with hundreds of other old people. All day long we'd play bingo, eat oatmeal and wait for our children to call."
5425,"Oh my yes. Thank you all for saving me. Especially you my little clone. No matter what you decide to do with your life, I'm still proud of you."
5427,"Don't worry son. You will. Incidentally, you might want to read up on a condition known as ""wandering bladder."""
5429,No reason. No reason at all.
5435,Ah! The exact centre of the Atlantic Ocean. This seems the logical place for fish to congregate.
5437,Indeed so.
5443,"Yeah, cool."
5465,You'll never catch anything with that primitive technology. What you need is this fish pheromone.  The most potent aphrodisiac known to fishkind.  Uh-oh!
5467,"Oh, my!"
5470,"Bender, be careful. That's the ships diamond filament tether. It's unbreakable."
5472,It belonged to my grandmother.
5482,"It's not snagged, the mechano man has caught something!  Sweet Zombie Jesus! It's huge!"
5485,A colossal-mouth bass!
5491,"Dear Lord, that's over 150 atmospheres of pressure."
5493,"Well it's a spaceship, so I'd say anywhere between zero and one."
5497,That should do it.
5509,Not necessarily. This is chance for Fry to test out my experimental anti-pressure pill.
5511,Well then good news! It's a suppository.
5530,"You're simply hallucinating, you ... moron."
5535,He may have ocean madness but that's no excuse for ocean rudeness.
5559,I'm almost finish reconfiguring the ships propulsion system. We can leave as soon as the paper-mâché is dry.
5562,"No, I've been busy."
5565,"We'll form a search party. Now, we'll need oxygen."
5567,"Ooh, that reminds me: You've all taken your pressure pills, right?"
5572,Could it possibly be? Are the old legends true?  It is! It's the fabled lost city of Atlanta!
5575,"This is uncomfortable and humiliating. Now, if they could put it in the form of a suppository."
5595,"Yes, we all miss our loved ones and gases. Come on, Fry."
5599,"Fry, you half-mad, half-insane maniac, be reasonable. Don't you realise that if you stay at this depth your body will permanently adapt to the pressure?"
5601,It means you'll never be able to return to the surface.
5603,(shouting) I'm bored! Let's go!
5608,"(shouting) Let's go, damnit! Let's go!"
5612,Bye.
5626,There! The engine modifications are complete.
5698,Oh my. That steamed carrot was a bit spicy for me.
5711,Holy Zombie Jesus!
5742,"You look beautiful. Incidentally, my favourite artist is Picasso."
5744,"Better yet, I'll build someone to fill in for you.  Some kind of gamma powered mechanical monster, with freeway on-ramps for arms and a heart as black as coal..."
5876,Where am I now?
5956,"(shouting) Hey! Unless this is a nude love-in, get the hell off my property!"
5958,"I can, but that's because I'm not a penniless hippie."
5986,"There's one way, and only one way, to determine if an animal is intelligent. Dissect its brain!"
5988,Enough chit-chat. Restrain the specimen!
6039,"Dear Lord, they're back!"
6139,A toast to Leela. She showed us it's wrong to eat certain things.
6151,"Good, good."
6155,Toss me the speech centre of the brain!
6240,Good news. There's a report on TV with some very bad news.
6253,Moron!
6267,It'll be the end of civilised society.
6283,We could use my new invention: A pointy rock tied to a stick.
6285,Defend the fire!
6287,Wha?  W-What do you want from me?
6290,Played pelvic pinochle? I'm afraid so.
6292,"It's a humiliating story that I hope never to tell. Well, pull up a chair."
6293,"(voice-over) Our paths first crossed when I was a researcher at Mom's Friendly Robot Company.  The moment our eyes met, we knew we'd be going at it like woodchucks."
6294,"(voice-over) She was my first love - or at least the earliest one I can still remember. But then, 70 years ago today..."
6295,"Good news, Mom. I've invented a new children's toy.  I call it ""Q.T. McWhiskers""! When you pet it, it shoots rainbows from its eyes."
6298,"But things 8 feet tall aren't cute! That's why my Colossal Tammy Tinkle Doll was such a failure. Oh, you don't understand me. We're finished!"
6302,Make up with her? After she went all psycho when I thought everything was cool? Impossible!
6312,The thought of caressing that leathery hide makes the tapioca rise in my gullet.
6314,"Very well. If cop a feel I must, then cop a feel I shall!"
6316,Never fear. My magic fingers still know how to do their stuff!
6326,"Show us this, ""the wheel""."
6335,I'm ready to seduce. I'm wearing my kissing dentures and my evening truss.
6339,I was out fleeing some robots and the silvery moonlight glinting off their bloody claws made me think of you.
6341,Uh-huh. May I come in?
6345,"Here, I brought you these."
6347,You favourite what? Why does my foot hurt?
6351,"And you broke mine. Granted, that was four or five hearts ago."
6353,"Oh, inventing, sending delivery crews to their doom, breeding atomic monsters."
6355,And your skin still dangles so gracefully from your neck.
6357,"No, it was silly of me to object. One foot tall, eight feet, 15 feet; what does it matter?"
6359,"16 feet? Go to hell! I was a fool to think you'd changed, you old bat!"
6361,(shouting) Damned she-fossil!
6363,"(thinking) Here we go. Just unhook it and get the remote. So many hooks! Come on, Farnsworth. Drat, the first one's back on again! I give up! Wait! Victory!  Oh, my. Now I'll just...the remote...I'll just... (talking) Oh, my."
6369,"Oh, yes."
6387,"I love you, Mom. Let's grow ancient together."
6390,"Look: It started out as a calculated plot to rummage through your underwear. But once I got in there, I found more - much more. And now I want to shout our love from the rooftops. Perhaps I'll breed some sort of albino shouting gorilla."
6392,"But, dustcakes..."
6395,Yes. But I'll always love her in my own subtle way.
6401,"Good news, everyone! I've invented a device that allows you to operate equipment from great distances. I call it ""the fing-longer"".  Observe.  And, here we go.  There!"
6405,"Pretty long, eh?"
6407,"Oh, that's just the What-If machine I invented. You pose it a What-If question and it generates a video simulation of what would happen."
6409,Of course it works!  It's just not very long.
6423,Nothing except and even equally big monster. This is chance to try out my experimental enlarging ray. But we'll need a guinea pig.
6425,Gotcha!
6442,"Well, Leela, care to give the What-If machine a whirl?"
6449,"Leela, could you come in here for a moment. I have something important to tell you."
6450,"I can't live forever and I need an heir. Someone to spend my vast riches and take care of my man-eating anteaters when I'm gone.  The others simply aren't level-headed enough. They're too impulsive. Not like you. Not like old, predictable, dull-as-dishwater Leela."
6452,"That's why I've made you my sole heir. The day I die, you'll be a very wealthy woman. Oh, my, yes. Incredibly wealthy. The day I die. Because you're so unimpulsive."
6508,Who else has a question for the What-If machine? Scruffy? Fry?
6512,We're not seeing it again! Ask something less stupid.
6514,"That question is less stupid, though you asked it in a profoundly stupid way.  What would happen if Fry never came to the future?"
6517,It appears that the very fabric of space-time has ripped.
6587,"That story was preposterous. Stephen Hawking in a pizzeria! This thing isn't worth the gold it's made of.  Anyway, the fing-longer seems to be arousing success."
6591,So that's what things would be like if I'd invented the fing-longer.  A man can dream though. A man can dream.
6606,Fuf! Superstitious robot mumbo-jumbo.
6608,"Yes, you idiot.  The circuit diagram is right here on the inside of your case."
6621,Hmm.  It has motor eye sensors attached to motion detectors.
6633,"Just as I suspected. These robots were buried in improperly shielded coffins. Their programming leaked into the castles wiring through this old, abandoned modem allowing them to project themselves as holograms."
6635,"Yes, that sequence of words I said made perfect sense. We really should tell Bender there's nothing to be afraid of."
6779,"Now be careful, Fry. And if you kill anyone, make sure to eat their heart, to gain their courage. Their rich, tasty courage."
6953,"Well, that's it. Let's reactivate him. (shouting) Wake up!"
6956,It's stuck in there with glue or something. I don't know.
6980,"Leela, have you seen the keys to the spaceship?"
6982,"Eh, wha'? I mean, what?"
6996,You've gone too far this time - all three of you!
6998,"You left the keys in the ignition. I mean, look at those two. Wasn't it obvious what would happen?"
7001,"I should fire you three right now, but I'm just not that cold-hearted."
7004,"Yes, yes! Let's all talk to Zoidberg."
7006,"So, Zoidberg. What's new?"
7105,"I'm sorry, Og, but I've got a new crew."
7106,"So, how was delivery to Fantasy Planet, where everyone's fantasies come to life?"
7110,"You see, Og? Everything's running smoothly, yes. And with Fry fired, I can finally leave my jigsaw puzzles out without him eating the pieces."
7120,"This can only end badly, Fry. Kids, a house -"
7194,You were in Pauly Shore's tube and they were delivering it to his movie screening.
7197,You wish! You're in Los Angeles!
7208,"Why, I've forgotten why I even fired you."
7210,"Oh, that's right. Get lost."
7246,"Fry, did you eat anything unusual recently?"
7250,"Egg salad? Hmm. Zoidberg will have to examine your gastrointestinal tract. Come everyone, give Fry some privacy."
7251,"If you can't see well enough through the two-way mirror, there'll be a close-up on this video screen."
7254,Watch for any subtle irregularity in Fry's bowel.
7259,Correct! Worm eggs! And the mayonaise was probably none too fresh either.
7261,"Only one. We'll have to travel deep inside Fry, in this!"
7263,"In each gastro-survival kit, you'll find a rain slicker, a disposable fun camera, and something to protect you against bacteria.... - a harpoon!"
7265,Oh my no. That would require extrememly tiny atoms. And have you priced those lately? I'm not made of money - leave me alone!
7267,"Anyhoo, your net suits will let you experience Fry's worm-infested bowels as if you were actually wriggling through them."
7269,Is everyone present?
7274,"Heres the plan:  We'll enter the ear, drip down the back of the throat and make for the bowel. There, we'll irritate the pelvic splachnic ganglion and cause an intestinal spasm, expelling - among other things - the parasites."
7276,"No, Fry can't know anything about the mission. If he finds out, the worms will try to defend themselves. They know everything he knows."
7278,"Leela, your role is to distract Fry so he doesn't notice what we're up to."
7289,"Wait, we just have to get past the eardrum!"
7294,Brace yourselves everyone. We're entering the interior of Fry's nose!
7296,Let's just pray nothing stimulates the delicate smell receptors. (whispering) Nobody make a smell.
7301,"We're in the heart. Better known as ""the love muscle."""
7303,"We should be safe, just so long as nothing makes it beat faster."
7305,No! Set course for that cholesterol-encrusted valve.
7315,"No, don't give up now! we're but a stones throw from the pyloric sphinchter."
7319,There it is! The stately capitol of Fry's bowel. A heavily guarded fortress surrounding the pelvic splachnic ganglion.
7321,"If we can stimulate that nerve, the bowel will convulse, expelling the entire worm society."
7323,"Listen, this is gonna be one hell of a bowel movement. Afterwards he'll be lucky if he has any bones left!"
7341,The nerve is through here. Where's Zoidberg?
7343,There it is! The pelvic splachnic ganglion. Tickle it and get ready for the ride of your lives!
7345,"Leela, you're just in time to help. If we don't get rid of the worms now, they'll burrow so deep into the bowel that not even Hermes' famous jerk prunes could dislodge them!"
7347,Fry will be stuck with the worms forever.
7351,Leela you ignorant dope! Now the worms will be in Fry forever.
7353,Oh that's stupid!
7419,"He always seemed so full of life. Laughing, singing, begging for scraps. And now this."
7423,Stop doing that!
7671,What's all the hubbub?
7673,"That you for your sympathy, talking square of linoleum."
7690,Dear God! We've got robots on the ceiling.
7700,Then he can't stay here. He's a menace to every straight person in the company. Go satisfy your bend lust and don't you come back to work until you do.
7736,"What an exquisite day. That azure sky, the verdant treetops.  Those delightful birds with their chirp, chirp, chirp and their tweet, tweet, splat."
7738,"Hmm. I'm not quite sure. Perhaps seeing things from a new perspective has reminded me of life's beauty. Or perhaps my new posture is causing blood to pool in the back of my brain, resulting in a mild delirium. Incidentally, you have a dime up your nose."
7744,My new bent outlook has completely re-energised me. I'm even dating a young Brazilian retired actress.
7746,Some say I'm robbing the cradle but I say she's robbing the grave.
7748,"I was just regaling your former co-workers with a tale of bedroom antics, the likes of which--"
7757,"So, Bender, tell us about this new girlfriend of yours."
7771,"Obsessing won't help, Bender. Take a lean back and enjoy life."
7854,Perhaps it's your outlook that needs a good bend. A 90-degree bend to a place where happiness is perpendicular to wonderment.
7858,Nonsense. It's just like in the song I wrote:
7861,"(singing) You gotta dangle,"
7864,I'm sad now.
7870,Zooka barooka! First prize is $500 and a year's supply of dog food!
7893,"Good news, everyone. We were supposed to make a delivery to the planet Tweenis 12 but it's been completely destroyed."
7895,They paid in advance.
7913,Ow. Ow. Ow.  I'm a genius. Ow. Ow.
7925,"Duh, I know! Let's play the lottery!"
7976,The professy will help!  Fire indeed hot!
8054,"Why, I've been a Harold Zoid fan since back when my hips were made of bone. As it happens, I still have some of my original 78s."
8211,Good news everyone! I'm sending you on an extremely controversial mission!
8213,Oh my no.
8214,"For this highly controversial mission, you'll be towing the Juan Valdez, an orbitting supertanker full of rich Columbian dark matter."
8216,"Impossible!  The tanker has 6000 hulls. So, unlike me, it's entirely leak-proof! Now, once you've hauled the tanker past the protestors -"
8218,Correct. 6000 hulls.
8220,(whispering) To avoid the tollbooth.
8223,What are you yapping about?
8225,This is an outrage. I demand that you hand over your captain's jacket.
8227,"I said hand it over!  Well Fry, or should I say Captain Fry?  No I shouldn't. Because Bender is the new captain!"
8229,"That's right. Being a captain is about intuition and heart. A good captain can't have either one. That's why cold, logical Bender is perfect for the job."
8401,No fair! You changed the outcome by measuring it.
8441,Dirt doesn't need luck.
8538,So you opened the record vault and the clover was gone?
8545,"Shut up friends. My internet browser heard us saying the word ""Fry"" and it found a movie about Philip J. Fry for us.  It alwso opened my calendar to Friday and ordered me some French fries."
8649,Phaser eye surgery is a capital idea. I'm sure Leela's tired of morons gaping at her eye all the time.
8655,Thatagirl!
8658,That's the stupidest idea I've ever heard you imbecile!
8662,No.
8731,"And Fry, you've got that brain thing."
8734,She's right!
8825,"Good news, everyone! Today marks our dear friend Dr. Zoidberg's 10th year with Planet Express. Huzzahs are in order."
8885,Keep your chin up!
8937,"Oh, don't worry, Fry. I too once spent a nightmare-ish time in a robot asylum. But now it's nearly over. So long."
8959,What a relief!
8994,You're going to do his laundry?
9019,Ouch! That's going to bleed when my heart beats.
9069,Where's the device that lets you speed or slow the passage of time?
9073,"Wrong again, idiot. There is no gas. Petroleum reserves ran dry in 2038."
9085,"Go on, you dummy."
9098,"Well, let's drag him to the kerb."
9298,Wha?
9302,"This will not stand!  I'll take you on, you air-balling bozos."
9304,"I may be an old man - in fact, I'm fairly sure I am - but I'll put you Globetrotters in your place with my team of mutant atomic supermen!"
9306,Behold: My mutant atomic supermen.
9308,"Well, they're still young. Mere atomic super boys, really. We'll need to speed up their growth with time particles called Chronitons."
9310,"Good news, everyone. You're off to the Tempest Nebula to gather Chronitons."
9319,None too soon. While you were gone the Trotters held a news conference to announce that I was a jive sucker.  Behold! My invincible nuclear mutants.
9329,"No showboarding, you atomic hotdog!"
9333,What the?  Did everything just jump around? Or did my brain just stroke off there for a second?
9335,Time-out! Time-out!
9337,"We seem to be lurching forward randomly in time, like a needle skipping on a record player."
9339,No. It must have something to do with those time particles I used to grow the Supermen. Time and space are ripping apart at the seams.
9341,"Oh, great. Now, on top of everything, we need a new fifth man."
9343,Hmm. Will said skills pay the bills?
9351,"Enough about your promiscuous mother, Hermes. We have bigger problems. This time disruption is extremely serious."
9353,Tate? What do you know about this?
9355,You're that Bubblegum Tate?
9357,"Yes, I see. Something involving that many big words could easily destabilise time itself."
9359,"Indeed so. At this rate, by Tuesday it will be Thursday; By Wednesday, it will be August and by Thursday, it will be the end of existence as we know it."
9366,"Interesting. It's as if we behave normally during the time skips, but then we have no memory of it."
9368,"...my, yes. Ooh, just like that. Any luck Bubblegum?"
9370,Not if you'll grant me the same liberty.
9373,"Bubblegum, look at this. The background time radiation is fluctuating wildly."
9394,"Ah, there is it. The Tempest Nebula. Take a whiff through the smellescope."
9396,"The odour of pure time leaking. When my crew removed the Chronitons, it destabilised the nebula, causing time skips throughout the universe."
9401,Their gravity might just divert the Chronitons to the empty side of the universe.
9404,Wha?
9407,"Ah, there we are. One gravity pump. Powerful enough to move the stars themselves. Now to begin the arduous task of attaching it to the ship so th -"
9408,Off you go - apparently.
9441,"Ye Gods, Bubblegum, we failed. The time skips haven't stopped at all."
9460,No wonder we failed to stop the time skips. Diverting Chronitons is mathematically impossible. I knew I should have checked your showboating Globetrotter algebra.
9463,The time skips are worse than ever now. Isolated spots are jumping by years at a time. Look.
9466,"Well, I'm stumped. We'll have to call in the finest scientific minds in the univ -"
9467,"Perhaps we could explode the whole damned nebula. What do you think, Curly Joe?"
9470,"By God, Sweet Clyde is right. An implosion might just form a black hole that would stop more Chronitons from escaping."
9472,"Doomsday device? Ah, now the ball's in Farnsworth's court.  I suppose I could part with one and still be feared."
9524,Boring? Wasn't that the period where they cracked the human genome and boy bands roamed the Earth?
9527,No. Why would I know that?
9538,"No, just the two."
9548,Yes it's been quite an hour and a half.
9558,Onto the internet you go!
9575,Download her. Let's just put a blank robot in the drive.
9582,Well duh! She's programmed to like you!
9601,"Oh dear! She's stuck in an infinite loop and he's an idiot. Well, that's love for you."
9607,It's just lucky I keep a copy in the VCR at all times!
9621,I knew I should have shown him Electro Gonhorrhea: The Noisy Killer.
9722,Focus!
9730,And what's this layer of ozone? That's never been there before.
9743,Remarkable! According the high precision digital chronograph it's July 9th 1947. Which would explain why the chronograph has turned into this pin-up calendar.
9745,Doy! Some idiot must have put metal in the microwave...
9747,...and the microwave's radiation combined with the gravitons and graviolis from the supernova blasted us through Time itself.
9753,And the alien they captured was...was...
9757,Yes we tore the universe a new space-hole alright! But it's clenching shut fast. Our only hope of getting back to our own time is to go through it in oh say......exactly 24 hours.
9759,You've got 8. But a more urgent concern is the microwave.  Without a working one we have no hope of returning to the future.
9762,"Your grandfather?  Stay away from him you dimwitted monkey. You mustn't interfere with the past. Don't do anything that affects anything, unless it turns out you were supposed to do it. In which case. for the love of God, don't not do it!"
9764,"If for example you were to kill your grandfather, you would cease to exist!"
9791,Ooo that's good news! You know you really don't cook enough roast Leela!  Ooo. Women!
9812,"I'll have the soylent green, with a slice of soylent orange and some soylent coleslaw."
9815,"Oh right!  I'll have a croque monsieur, the paella, two mutton pills and a stein of mead!"
9819,"Oh Lord! We'll have to endure the horrible music of the big bopper, and then the terrible tragedy of his death."
9821,"No! That would alter history. Above all else, it is our sacred duty to preserve the past exactly as it was."
9823,Wha?
9853,What the hell have you done Fry?
9864,Start the ship Leela. Let's just steal the damned radar dish and get back to our own time!
9866,Oh a lesson in not changing history from Mr I'm-My-Own-Grandpa! Let's get the hell out of here already! Screw history!
9874,Huh wha? Oh right!
9878,Choke on that causality!
9881,"Impossible. The supernova timehole is closing! If we don't leave now, we'll never get back to the 31st century!"
9892,"Well, now everything is back as it was. And if history doesn't care that out degenerate friend Fry is his own grandfather, then who are we to judge?"
9904,"Cover that fireplace, confound you! I've only a few years to live. I don't wanna spend them dead."
9907,"Oh, we're doomed! Every year we're doomed. Thanks be I had these bullet-proof shutters installed."
9908,"Bring it on, Santa! That bloodthirsty cadaver junkie can't touch us as long as we're not stupid enough to leave this building."
9911,"In a related matter, you'll be delivering this sack of children's letters directly to Santa at his death fortress on Neptune."
10011,"Yes, yes, yes. You sound like a broken mp3!"
10014,(shouting) No!
10025,There he is again!
10069,But it's not boring!
10084,No heat.
10090,That's a big crock of--  Hold me!
10099,"There. I've finished fine tuning my What If? machine. It can answer any What If? question, accurate to within 1/10th of a plausibility unit."
10101,Who wants the machine to show them an alternate reality?
10103,"Oh lordy loo! There he goes again. Well, let's give baby what he wants.  What if Bender were human?"
10104,"Good news everyone. I've discovered a way to make Bender human using a process I call ""reverse fossilisation."""
10106,"Well, in regular fossilisation, flesh and bone turn to minerals. Realising that, it was a simple matter to reverse the process. I've already tested it by turning the toaster into a racoon."
10108,Are you ready Bender?
10111,It worked! Eat it everyone who never won a Nobel Prize! And that includes you Amy!
10121,Speak for yourself!
10134,"Come Bender, its time to go home and rest. I need you in top shape next week when I present you to the Nobel Prize committee. Bender?"
10137,"Uh as I've said before, I used reverse fossilisation, which is the reverse of regular, uh..."
10139,"Ah, them without further stalling for time, I present to the Nobel judges, the first robot ever turned into a human."
10144,"This, uh, scientific breakthrough, uh, heralds a new dawn in human-robot relations yes."
10146,"And, uh thats why I believe I deserve the Nobel Prize."
10151,Weee!
10155,Care to say a few words Bender?
10158,About 12 hours ago when the party started.
10160,No. That was air escaping from the folds of his fat.  Goodnight sweet prince. You were the greatest man any of us will ever know. Well lets get him out of here. He's starting to smell up the joint.
10162,Who else has a question for the What If? machine? Scruffy? Katrina? Xanfor?
10164,Can you put that in the form of a question?
10166,Oh great machine we beseech thee. What if life were more like a video game?
10169,Monkies aren't donkies! Quit messing with my head!
10204,Forget it you pixelated pirates. We need those quarters to do our laundry.
10215,"Well, there's time for one last question. Let's turn to the Who Ask machine to see who's next."
10264,I am the Professor. Great and...uh...forgetful! Now what do you nice kids want?
10266,"Oh blithery poop my cowardly lobster! You don't need courage. Afterall, who needs courage when you have a gun?"
10268,"And you lad, all you need is brain."
10271,Here you go my friend. 5000 Professor Land fun bucks!
10273,"As for you young lady, you want to go home right?"
10275,"Nonsense. Now click your big honking boots together three times and wish to go home to Kansas, to live in poerty with your dirt farming, teetotalling aunt and uncle."
10282,"Oh, so close."
10298,We'll need to look our best if we're to get the account of our new potential customer Romanticorp!
10301,Everyone suit up. We're off to the most romantic city on Earth!
10302,"Remember, we've got to show these people we're not bitter husks of human beings who long ago abandoned hope of finding love in this lifetime. Leela you'll have to do some acting."
10308,"You know, romance is an important part of our work too, uh right everyone?"
10324,"So, do we have the contract?"
10325,"With that big new Romanticorp contract, I've been able to make those government mandated upgrades you've all been suing me about."
10329,Oh it must have been the ship's new improved personality software I installed.
10332,It even comes with an adjustable voice.
10472,"Good news, everyone! You all know the orphanarium where Leela grew up?"
10476,"Well done, fellows! Anyway, said orphanarium has named Leela orphan of the year."
10480,And the good news keeps on coming. Behold my latest invention.
10482,Ta-da! It's a glow-in-the-dark nose you can wear over your regular non-glowing nose. Observe.
10487,"That? It's uh...nothing. Yes, nothing. If you think it's anything you're a suspicous moron."
10491,"Alright, alright so the machine produces a few toxic by-products! You don't have to make a federal case out of it."
10494,"Hmm, I know that's a rip but I'll pay for the convenience. Do you take credit cards?"
10604,"Of course. But only into Beta Crypt 3, a language so complex, there's even less chance of understanding it."
10606,Very well.
10608,"It can do other things. Why shouldn't it?  Of course, even if it is possible to analyse the message there's no way of knowing how long it would take. It could take an hour or it could take a hundred million years."
10610,Certainly not. Two dings means it's done.  But not like that. Slightly more rapid.
10614,"That's it, it's done!  I can't believe it! My mind is boggling. The analysis of the note is printing out now."
10667,This is quite a large ranch you have.
10669,It's the same on Earth.
10691,That is stupid!
10729,Hmm. I might have mental anguish.
10731,I'm OK then.
10750,"It sounds dangerous. Someone could get killed. Fry, Leela, Bender, I want you to go with him."
10832,"This mission is incredibly dangerous. Someone's sure to be killed. Fry, Leela, Bender--"
10925,Oh fuff! What's the point in remembering something? You're just going to forget it five seconds later.
10946,Your standard Bending Unit is made of an iron-osmium alloy. But Bender was different. Bender has a point-04% nickel impurity.
10971,(bashful) Oh stop!
10972,News everyone! Today you're going to Osiris 4 to deliver this enourmous sandstone block.
11143,No. I'm afraid the smelloscope isn't powerful enough. Bender's odour is so mild it's being overpowered by local sources.
11281,Ohh!
11284,Where am I?
11286,"Oh God! I'm dead. Well, no matter. (reading) Thank you all for coming. I don't recognise any of you, nor can I recall why I am here. Now without further ado, a film highlighting Planet Express Inc.'s latest fiscal year."
11303,'Cause your apartment smells like Polygrip and cat pee.
11324,I move that your cat stinks and is ugly.
11332,I'm your man.
11335,Me!
11350,I'll ruin you like I ruined this company.
11352,"Uh, um, uh business plan, uh, yes. I keep it here - right next to my heart."
11354,So long suckers!
11421,"This isn't a business, I've always thought of it as more of a source of cheap labour. Like a family."
11485,"Oh uh what? I'm awake, I'm awake!"
11507,Cygnoids? On our block? Flying foo! They should go back where they came from.
11509,No.
11532,(shouting) Go team! Beat those no good Cygnoids! Show them they stink at a game they've never played before!
11562,Why is your number seven-eight's?
11675,(shouting) Go Leela!
11708,"Yes, it's a perfect scale model of the universe's largest bottle. I put a tiny spaceship inside to keep it from being boring."
11710,Get -!  For the last time Zoidberg look with your eyes not with your claws!
11713,Oh God! My tract!
11717,Good idea!
11722,"Zoidberg, are you coming?"
11724,Because I don't want you touching that thing.
11728,Good thing I secretly installed this wormhole in the table!
11730,You know I'm not quite sure.  Oh dear me!
11783,"That's right Ricardo, a ship in a bottle...! What's that...? Well hang on, I'll look."
11785,I've gathered you all here in the accusing parlour because one of you is a miniature ship wrecker!
11787,Certain clues suggest the culprit is none other than our own...Philip J. Fry!
11789,Oh it was a brilliant scheme but you made one fatal mistake...leaving this confession note.
11792,Then I have no choice but to charge you the full cost of the materials. $10.
11859,That's my robot! I own him!
11870,"Hmm. Let me see that vial Bender.  Good Lord! According to the spectrolizer, Spargle's magic ingredient was...water. Ordinary water!"
11873,"Yes, ordinary water. Laced with nothing more than a few spoonfuls of LSD."
11876,I do!
12133,Perhaps this movie will help us take our minds off the heat.
12147,"You heard the good news everyone! Save the Earth, et cetera et cetera!  Bye!"
12149,The wha? Oh Halley's Comet of course. The only sufficient source of ice cubes that don't have bugs in them!
12151,Yes there's no safer occupation than mining. Especially when you're on a snowball whipping through space at a million miles an hour!  Safe!
12187,"Forget it, I'm not going! I have my reasons! Shut up all of you!"
12189,My hip hurts! I'm in the middle of cooking a turkey! I have warranty cards to fill out! I'm not just making excuses! Alright I'll go!
12200,Wernstrom!
12206,Absolutely not! I won't speak! I've got nothing to hide!
12208,I demand the floor!
12210,"Well nuts to me. I'm taking the stage! I know the source of the greenhouse gases. But in my shame I've kept it secret for 75 long years. Ohhh, it haunts my memory still."
12212,Don't do what? Don't use this memory ray so I can remember what happened back then?
12214,"Oh dear, I've failed again."
12216,"Ooo, ouch, stop!"
12218,A flaming burp.
12220,Its not always a burp. We still have one problem though. This robot will never meet emission standards.
12222,Well...I suppose the environment can take one more for the team.
12224,Oh this is all my fault!
12227,All modern robots descend from my original smog blasting designs. And that's the cause of global warming today.
12232,"Wait, surely there's a better -"
12272,Everyone listen!
12274,I've devised a way to save you and to stop global warming at the same time! Granted you're all blasting out greenhouse gases.
12276,"But we can use those very gases to save the planet. If you all vent your exhaust directly upward in one burst it should thrust the Earth further from the sun, thus cooling it.  By my calculations we'll need the full force of every last robot. So quickly, everyone point your exhaust vents straight upwards.  Now vent! Vent like the wind!  Harder! Harder!"
12280,A billion robot lives are about to be extinguished! Oh the Jedi's are going to feel this one!
12285,Thank you. I deserve this!
12287,Why yes! One week longer to be exact.
12319,Why don't you try protesting? Like those native Martians. Always whining that people don't treat their ancestor's bones with respect.
12349,"No, actually we've discovered Fry's dog was fast-fossilised, preserving it's cellular structure!"
12354,"Ah Cubert, my precious babe. I'm going to attempt to clone Fry's dog. Using the very same apparatus I used to clone you!  Ooo look, there's a smidge of toe still in here.  You see, beneath the fossil's crunchy, mineral shell, there's still a creamy core of dog nougat!"
12356,"Amazingly yes. In cases of rapid fossilisation, I can press this brain scan button, retrieving Seymour's memories at the precise instant of doggy death!"
12359,I just need to reset the Clone-O-Mat from Human Mode to Dog Mode.
12361,"Uh-oh, this may take a while."
12408,Behold once more the mighty Clone-O-Mat! Requiring such vast amounts of electricity that we must harness the elemental power of nature itself!  I speak of course...of molten lava! Deep within the Earth's core. To the sub-basement!
12420,Not necessarily. For the dog may yet survive.
12422,"Indeed. You see, that fossil was made of dolomite. The tough black mineral that won't cop out when there's heat all about. By contrast, observe the lava's affect on this ice swan.  Of course, that would have melted even at room temperature. I just wanted to get rid of it. But had it been made of that righteous mineral dolomite, there's a slim chance it might have survived."
12424,Perhaps. For a few minutes. It's dolomite baby!
12434,I'm a professor! Why isn't anyone listening to me? You can't go in because you'll melt. The fossil only has a chance because it's made of dolomite!
12447,Professor! Lava! Hot!
12452,Very well. Let this abomination unto the Lord begin!  Interesting. It seems Seymour died at the ripe old age of 15.
12454,Indeed.
12456,Oh sure! Smash the smart guy's machine!
12473,And you Cubert. I cloned you from one of my warts and I can send you straight back in there.
12477,(shouting) What?
12487,I've warned you not to use those things!
12493,"Crew, you remember Cubert?  Wonderful! And I'm sure you won't mind being their legal guardians for a month!"
12502,Eh wha? Oh! This is my latest invention. A device that lets anyone sound exactly like me!
12504,I am? That's not good news at all you little...
12506,There is no target consumer! Only targets. Targets that will tremble as their new master hands down edicts in my glorious booming voice!  Now quit pestering me you scoundrels!
12520,"Oh bother, what have they done now?"
12527,Accusing gentle Bender of a misdeed? That's the last straw! You boys have been underfoot long enough!
12535,(mocking) Perhaps they've constructed a teddybear hospital!
12538,Who's going to use a delivery service with a kicked sign? Nobody that's who!
12541,Phew!
12543,(mocking) Yes its a tremendous responsibility alright!  What if a paper were to land in a puddle?
12559,"Goodness there must be 50 papers in that bundle! That's a big number, 50."
12565,(shouting) I'm blowing you a kiss.
12567,(shouting) It's closing in! You can't avoid it! It's a cheek-seeker. And...gotcha!
12569,"Well, well, well. If it isn't our little muchkin moguls!"
12585,"That's why we need you, our loyal crew, to make Planet Express 800% more profitable."
12589,What?
12595,"Folks, the situation is grim but we shall prevail, thanks to you, our crack team of loyal dregs!"
12598,"Yes, of course you are. Now we've got to buckle down and save Planet Express."
12603,Balderdash! I never agreed to that!
12605,Tax dodge nothing! You take one nap in a ditch in the park and they start declaring you this and that.
12614,Did I ever tell you how I used to own that ship?
12630,"Uh, might a homeless old man have a touch more beef bourguignon? And another tequila slammer?  Please?"
12635,They're so stinking talented they don't even need their fathers anymore.
12637,You did? Tough luck suckers!
12642,Why did you boys do all this?
12645,Damn right we are! Now come on. Let's go do a little Father/Son weaseling out of this.
12658,"Now now, no need to give us the business. We'd like a word with you daddy."
12661,"Mr Blob, our sons have come to apologise for damaging your window. They've learned their lesson and they want to make amends."
12664,Now see here. We assured our sons that you'd accept their apology.
12665,No one gives my son that option!
12672,He's coming to finish the job. Someone toss me out the window!
12673,I suppose.
12676,"Uh, won't join us Mr Blob?"
12678,"It would seem we've taught our boys a lesson about life: Man or Blob, it's whats inside that counts."
12685,... an extremely dangerous mission ...
12691,"Of course, it wouldn't be Freedom Day without the traditional Freedom Tub!"
12850,Indeed.
12864,Good news everyone. You'll be delivering pain medicine to the hive mind of Nigel 7.
12867,We could but we won't! It's a spaceship dammit not a prom limousine!  If anyone needs me I'll be in the Angry Dome.
12931,"Even I laughed at me when I built this alien cross species genetic analyser but I guess I showed myself! Subjects, please enter the chamber.  Now to take a DNA sample.  When I pull this switch the maternifuge will spin at 10,000 RPM, seperating out everyone who isn't the mother....father...whatever."
12933,Good. Fry's ejection indicates that he is not the man-mom.  Nor is Captain Brannigan.
12935,Zoidberg?! What the hell were you doing in there?
13039,"Good news anyone, the Swedish robot from pi-kea is here with the supercollider I ordered."
13048,"Bad news nobody, the supercollider super-exploded. I need you to take it back and exchanged it for a wobbly CD rack and some of those ransid meatballs."
13176,"I don't remember much buddy, and you're no looker!"
13178,Yes dammit!
13233,Pazuzu you ungrateful gargoyle! I put you through college and this is how you repay me?
13234,"Let's get this gargoyle hunt on the road. Driving gloves, driving goggles. Driving thong. There."
13236,You? A woman? I'm trying to catch a monster not find the quickest route to the mall! Let me just adjust the seat.
13240,Because we're in a hurry that's why.
13243,"Oh it's 2:30, we can still catch the early bird dinner special."
13245,My wha?
13246,Hello Mavis! Surprised to see me back again so soon?
13248,I expect you'll want to see my angry crotchety grandpa discount card!
13250,But it's good for a lifetime.
13253,Well I can't keep them in my mouth. They're nuclear powered!
13256,Mmm! Damn good meat!
13262,Dear God no!
13264,"But I like being old. I don't have to talk to my parents, no one asks me to help move their stuff, I don't need to understand today's ""edgy TV sitcoms."""
13266,My thong!
13268,Go to hell Heather!
13270,Give me back my floppy face!
13271,Careful with the giblets!
13273,Ahh!
13275,You sound just like my tennis instructor.
13277,"Oh I don't have time for this. I have to go and buy a single piece of fruit with a coupon and then return it, making people wait behind me while I complain."
13280,Well that was an utter waste of time.
13282,Poodlespit!  53 years old?  Now I'll need a fake ID to rent ultra-porn.
13284,"Dear Lord, you've all reverted to your childhood forms!"
13286,"While I try to restore our normal ages, I expect you all to go about your jobs like normal professionals."
13290,Quiet! Quiet I say!
13296,That's not what happened! Shut up and go live with your parents.
13308,I've got to find a way to escape the horrible ravages of youth! Suddenly I'm going to the bathroom like clockwork every three hours! And those jerks at social security stopped sending me cheques! Now I have to pay them!
13310,"Fine, get going!"
13312,We won't know that until you leave.
13314,There's the door.
13346,"Yes, I'd like to meet this ""moose."" But in the meantime I have good news. I may have solved our age problem."
13348,"It seems the Youthasizer tar was saturated with time-altering chronitons. A thin layer is still stuck to our DNA as well as Bender's Robot DNA or ""RNA."""
13350,Yes?
13352,Yes yes. Anyhow I've designed an oil eating bacterium that should take the tar right off.
13355,"Don't you understand you little nitwit? Unless you're treated soon, the only way to restore your true age would be to grow into it! Just as God intended."
13364,Initiating controlled infection.
13367,"Damn! the bacteria pigged out on the tar and now they're getting freaky deaky, spreading chronitons throughout our systems. We're getting younger by the minute!"
13369,Word! We'll all keep getting younger and younger until we suffer a fate worse than death - pre-life! Then death.
13370,I've got to stop this reverse aging before we all shrivel up and suffer the agony of unbirth. Think you disco duck think!
13372,Get off me you parasitic lamprey!
13374,Would you all chill! I can't think with you kids cramping my style! Oh I need a babysitter!
13380,"The Fountain Of Aging? Hmm, it is just a legend. Still, they called the Tooth Fairy a legend and now it's head of the FBI."
13381,Sup? Kids ready?
13383,I had a few beers but I'm cool to drive.
13390,"Teddybear junction, the worst scum hole in the galaxy."
13391,This solar system is like way old.
13393,Newsflash! Everything's getting older the closer we get to that sun!
13395,Shut up! I was gonna say that!
13397,We gotta be real real careful to stay in just long enough to make us our right ages again.
13398,Zoidberg! Get out of there!
13400,Jeepers!
13405,Thanks for the help Weewa. Once we're gwown up you can go back to your famiwy. We'wl never bother you again.
13407,It's working! Hooray!  I can't hold on!
13409,No Leela! You can't give up your childhood! You'll never have another chance at it!
13415,Even older! Huzzah!
13422,And you my faithful fiend! How can I ever repay you?
13655,Bad news everyone. You're not good enough to go on your next mission.
13659,Because. And says me. It's an extremely dangerous mission that killed my last crew. And you're not nearly as good as them.
13663,Collecting honey. Ordinary honey.
13665,This is no ordinary honey. It's produced by vicious space bees. A single sting of their hideous neuro-toxin can cause instant death!
13667,Your insides will boil out of your eye sockets like a science fair volcano!
13669,These bees are larger than most Buicks and twice as ugly!
13714,No no no no no no no.  I'm lying to make her feel better.
13723,This makes me the oldest member of my family.
13739,"Oh course he still exists. As a frozen corpse in outer space!  Oh, I made myself sad."
13748,Bullpies!
13749,Lay down here and we'll do some tests. If Fry is out there then Leela's brain could be acting as a five pound ouija board.
13751,"Some sort yes. In France it's called a ""guillotine."""
13753,Yes. Easily.
13755,Well I suppose there's a slim -  I don't believe it!
13757,"No. According to this gizmometer, Fry is dead and nothing can bring him back! Remarkable."
13761,"No no, no one's saying that! But I'm certainly thinking it loudly."
13778,That's not Fry's jacket. Fry's jacket is red! That's your jacket. An off the rack lime green affair.
13787,You've been taking space honey? Be careful you purple haired imbecile!
13792,"Incredible! According to the gizmometer, Fry touched the royal jelly in the space hive, leaving an imprint of his DNA and brainwaves. Then, when it spilled on the couch, it recombined with trace amounts of Fry's hair and skin -"
13794,"Yes Bender, thank you. In short, the various fluids Fry left in the couch caused the royal jelly to regenerate his entire being!"
13864,"Good news everyone, I'm still technically alive! Yes!  But I need to you to dispose of this crazy ass experiment that almost killed me.  You'll have to throw it into the sun itself, for only the thermonuclear inferno of the sun has enough energy to ensure its total destruction!"
13866,That's not good enough.
13868,Yes yes!
13870,No peeking!  I don't know what's in there but I'm sure our minds would be unable to comprehend -
13872,"I don't care.  Listen well: No matter what happens, no matter how great your curiosity, you are forbidden to look in this box. Forbidden!  Pretty tantilising though!"
13910,Astonishing. I must have created a parallel universe!
13912,Ow.
13916,Let's recap what's happened so far. As you can see I accidentally created a box containing your universe.
13926,Wait a minute. If our universes are identical then why did our Leela look into the box and your Leela didn't?
13929,Interesting. Apparently the key difference between our universes is that coin flips have opposite outcomes.
13932,Your people and your slight differences disgust me. I'm going home. Where's that blue box with our universe in it?
13934,Nonsense! I would never do such a thing unless you would already have been going to do that!
13936,You heard me!
13938,And you all do the same!
13965,"Say, I hope you won't think it ""evil"" of me to ask how you got that stylish head wound!"
13967,Of course! I had the same idea! I flipped a coin to decide if I should proceed but it came up tails - so I didn't. How'd it go?
13969,Oh you!
13980,"After carefully reading the scriptures, we've concluded that none of us are evil!"
13986,Oh go on! Wait a second. If your Hermes was about to destroy the box containing our universe...
13988,Oh my!
13991,Right. Good thing Professor B there hid it in the sealed clam tank. No one but a crazy lobster would look there!
14000,No. We must attempt to create another box containing our universe! Doy!
14029,Gotcha!
14031,"Nonsense, why there's a whole universe in there."
14034,Get a job! (shouting into the parabox) We've got the box. Everyone pull your wires.
14035,Hurry! Back to Universe A!
14036,Hermes don't press that button!
14043,Ready?
14044,There. That space-time inversion has given us their box and vice-versa!
14046,Correct! This box contains our own universe!
14050,"Yes, all that is and ever shall be is in that box! And the box itself is probably worth something too. We must cherish it, as we cherish every moment of our lives."
14059,I'm well aware of that.
14080,As a man it has become too much of a chore for me to clean out my wrinkles each day. Is it true that stem cells may fight the aging process?
14082,One pound of stem cells please.
14098,Hey! Turn that damn music......up!
14130,The key is to grab life by the hojos! Live every day like it might be your last!
14132,One bowl of mild verena.
14156,Ow! Not so rough!
14184,"Wha?  Uh, gotta go, uh fight club!"
14186,I'm afraid the face you fell in love with was actually just a blob of living gunk I bought with my tax refund.
14188,That certainly is honest.
14190,"You, fat as the Queen of Seacows."
14192,Oh my!
14209,We're trapped my sweet hippopotamus!
14225,Oh my yes!
14231,Oh Lord. Hiking is always such a strain on the buttocks.
14235,Don't tell me you actually believe in Bigfoot you blathering ninny-hammer!
14252,(shouting) Bunk! Bunk I say! Bring me a bag full of Bigfoot's droppings or shut up!
14253,Shut up!
14266,Goodnight employess.
14279,Fry! What in Sega Genesis happened to you?
14288,Which last night?
14296,Well there's no sense fretting. Good Lord you're ugly! The fact is your nose is gone and we'll never find out who did it or why.
14429,"Oh, let's go check on Hermes. All this inspiring multi-culturalism is angrying up my blood.  Sweden? I don't think so!"
14439,"Don't worry, the fat pig will do fine thanks to this flabbo-dynamic spandex bodysuit I've designed.  It redistributes his weight, shifting his centre of gravity closer to his knees."
14441,Now that's a limboer's body!
14454,"(shouting) Go bodysuit, go!"
14472,Oh I think we should just stay friends.
14474,Bender a robot sex change is a complex and dangerous procedure. Replacing your testosteroil with Fembot lubricants can cause wild mood swings. And the effects may be irreversible. Well let's get started!
14478,"I'm sorry ladies but I must do this. Not for you, not for Bender, but for the proud people of Robonia!"
14481,(shouting) Quiet! (talking) I'm about to begin the process of reshaping Bender's body into a tender delicate form.
14482,(dramatically) Draining male oil.  Infusing female oil.  Removing item.
14493,"Dear Lord, a coaster! The Femzoil must be sacheting girlishly into your processor."
14523,"Oh dear. Her mood swings are getting wilder. She's becoming a slave to her emotions. Just like all women, particularly you Leela."
14570,You're falling into the final debilitating stages of womanhood. You've waited too long to switch back you dingbat!
14601,Turn off that crap-o-rama! One mistake now and Bender will be trapped forever between the already ill-defined robot sexes.
14605,Almost done.
14616,Sentimental drivel-poop.
14633,Like fun it is you glass headed wallaby!
14635,Werrrnstrom!
14661,Indeed. That's why I bought one to help around the office.
14668,Oh look Bender if you want something to do stop making out and give us a hand.
14686,Yes?
14689,Well then there's only one solution. You need an upgrade to make you compatible with Robot 1-X's new technology.
14693,"Yes for God sakes, yes!"
14756,(shouting) Oh! I'm blind!
14758,"What do you mean ""no power""? We're living in the future."
14763,That's just stupid.
14766,You wanged my ship you walnut panelled idiot!
14817,"Hmm, you didn't have a birth so technically, no.  Oh, don't feel bad. We can celebrate the day I extracted you from the cloning tank. Or the day I scraped that DNA from that growth on my back."
14819,Ah yes. It was 13 years ago next week. I used this very fork.
14837,Well that doesn't mean that no one is coming and that you two are total losers. Who gave you that idea?
14842,"Mm-hm, mm-hm."
14921,The ruffians smoked one of your cigars.
14924,What? Such an act would be most uncomfortable for both of us! Where did you learn such language?
14935,Good news everyone. Hermes and I have started a Bender protest group.
14938,And for what? Some kind of cheap laugh? That's not what F-A-R-T is all about.
14955,What's going on in here?  Oh. Now I'm really outraged.
14959,Hmm. There's something wrong with your story but I can't put my finger on it. Of course! You don't have friends!
14962,"Balderdash! I'll be the judge of who's cool, using the cool-o-meter!"
14964,"Good Lord, I'm getting a reading of over 40 mega-Fonzies!"
14972,I'll tell you what. Our boys have taken up stealing! One of the worst and coolest of crimes.
14982,Listen up Hollywood. We're an exciting new mob.
14987,Booya!
14991,There'll be no further nasty.  We still have the option of resorting to violence.
14993,I saw it on TV in that episode where Bender shot Calculon! How cool is that?
14995,Quit the show!
14997,I'm a cold blooded punk!
15001,Wha?
15003,I was using that!
15014,"Uh...that we should all take TV a little less seriously. And more importantly, turn it off once in a while."
15019,"Well, uh, that depends what's on."
15021,Ah let's just keep watching.
15023,Wha?
15025,Oh!
15030,"(singing) We're dedicated, yes!"
15188,(singing) It can't be real -
15198,(singing) I can't believe the devil is so unforgiving.
