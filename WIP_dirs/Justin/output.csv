0,MAN,(voice-over) Space. It seems to go on and on forever. But then you get to the end and the gorilla starts throwing barrels at you.
1,FRY,And that's how you play the game!
2,KID,"You stink, loser!"
3,PANUCCI,"Hey, Fry. Pizza goin' out! C'mon!!"
4,FRY,"Michelle, baby! Where you going?"
5,MICHELLE,"It's not working out, Fry.   I put your stuff out on the sidewalk!"
6,FRY,I hate my life I hate my life I hate my life.
7,BIKE THIEF,Happy new year!
8,FRY,"Hello? Pizza delivery for......Icy Wiener?! Aw, crud! I always thought at this point in my life I'd be the one making the crank calls!  Here's to another lousy millennium."
9,CROWD,Ten!
10,CROWD,Neuf!
11,CROWD,Otto!
12,CROWD,Sabaa!
13,CROWD,Eksi!
14,CROWD,Wu!
15,CROWD,Chaar!
16,CROWD,Thathu!
17,CROWD,Wu!
18,CROWD,One!
19,FRY,What the?
20,FRY,"My God! It's the future. My parents, my co-workers, my girlfriend. I'll never see any of them again. Yahoo!"
21,MAN,(dramatically) Welcome to the world of tomorrow!
22,LOU,Why do you always have to say it that way?
23,TERRY,"Haven't you ever heard of a little thing called showmanship?  (dramatically) Come, your destiny awaits!"
24,LOU,Have a nice future.
25,FRY,Cool! Just like in Star Trek!  Ow!
26,WOMAN,"Good afternoon, sir.  Name?"
27,FRY,"Uh, Fry."
28,WOMAN,I'm Leela. Now it's New Year's Eve so I'd like to decide your fate quickly and get out of here.
29,FRY,Can I ask you a question?
30,LEELA,As long as it's not about my eye.
31,FRY,Uh...
32,LEELA,Is it about my eye?
33,FRY,Sort of.
34,LEELA,Just ask the question.
35,FRY,What's with the eye?
36,LEELA,"I'm an alien, alright? Now let's drop the subject."
37,FRY,"Cool, an alien! Has your race taken over the Earth?"
38,LEELA,"No, I just work here."
39,FRY,Wait a minute! Is that blimp accurate?
40,LEELA,Yep. It's December 31st 2999.
41,FRY,"My God, a million years!"
42,LEELA,I'm sure this must be very upsetting for you.
43,FRY,"Y'know, I guess it should be but actually I'm glad. I had nothing to live for in my old life. I was broke, I had a humiliating job and I was beginning to suspect my girlfriend might be cheating on me."
44,LEELA,"Well, at least here you'll be treated with dignity. Now strip naked and get on the probulator."
45,LEELA,Interesting. Your DNA test shows one living relative. He's your great great great great great great great...
46,LEELA,...great great great great great nephew.
47,FRY,That's great! What's the little guy's name?
48,LEELA,Professor Hubert Farnsworth.
49,FRY,Eurgh!
50,FRY,"Y'know, I'm the luckiest guy in the whole future. I've been given a second chance and this time I'm not going to be a total loser.  What's that?"
51,LEELA,Your permanent career assignment.
52,FRY,Delivery boy? No! Not again! Please! Anything else!
53,LEELA,Take your hands off me! You've been assigned the job you're best at just like everyone else.
54,FRY,What if I refuse?
55,LEELA,Then you'll be fired...
56,FRY,Fine!
57,LEELA,...out of a cannon into the Sun!
58,FRY,But I don't like being a delivery boy.
59,LEELA,"Well that's tough! Lots of people don't like their jobs but we do them anyway. You gotta do what you gotta do! Now hold out your hand, I'm gonna implant your career chip. It'll permanently label you as a delivery boy."
60,FRY,Keep that thing away from me!
61,LEELA,"Hold still, damnit. I don't have good depth perception!  You've got until the count of five to let me out of here. One..."
62,FRY,See you in a thousand years!  You owe me one.
63,FRY,Whoa!
64,MAN #1,JFK Jr. Airport.
65,FRY,Cool!  Um. Cross Town Express?
66,MAN #2,Pft! Tourist!
67,FRY,"Hey! A phone booth! I can call my nephew. Wow, a real live robot! Or is that some kind of cheesy New Year's costume?"
68,ROBOT,Bite my shiny metal ass.
69,FRY,It doesn't look so shiny to me.
70,ROBOT,"Shinier than yours, meatbag!"
71,ROBOT,"Listen, buddy, I'm in a hurry here. Let's try for a twofer!"
72,BOOTH VOICE,"Please select mode of death: ""Quick And Painless"" or ""Slow And Horrible""."
73,FRY,"Yeah, I'd like to place a collect call."
74,BOOTH VOICE,"You have selected: ""Slow And Horrible""."
75,ROBOT,"Great choice!  Bring it on, baby!"
76,ROBOT,"C'mon, c'mon! Kill me already! By the way, my name's Bender!"
77,FRY,Help! What's happening?
78,BOOTH VOICE,"You are now dead. Thank you for using Stop-N-Drop, America's favourite suicide booth since 2008."
79,BENDER,Lousy stinking rip-off!  Well I didn't have anything else planned for today. Let's go get drunk!
80,LEELA,"...two, three -- Hey!"
81,TERRY,(dramatically) Welcome to the world of tomorrow!
82,LEELA,"Shut up, Terry."
83,IPGEE,"This is unacceptable, Leela. You must find this Mr. Fry and install his chip."
84,LEELA,"Look, he's just a nobody who doesn't want to be a delivery boy. I'd really rather not force it on him."
85,IPGEE,"Well that's your job, whether you like it or not and it's my job to make you do your job whether I like it or not - which I do - very much! Now get to work!  Life is good!"
86,FRY,Why would a robot need to drink?
87,BENDER,"I don't need to drink, I can quit anytime I want!  So they made you a delivery boy, huh? Man, that's as bad as my job."
88,FRY,Really? What do you do Bender?
89,BENDER,"I'm a bender. I bend girders, that's all I'm programmed to do."
90,FRY,You any good at it?
91,BENDER,"You kidding? I was a star! I could bend a girder to any angle: 30 degrees, 32 degrees, you name it! (unsure) 31. (normal) But I couldn't go on living once I found out what the girders were for."
92,FRY,What?
93,BENDER,"Suicide booths!  Well, Fry, it was a pleasure meeting you, I'm gonna go kill myself."
94,FRY,Wait! You're the only friend I have!
95,BENDER,You really want a robot for a friend?
96,FRY,"Yeah, ever since I was six."
97,BENDER,"Well, OK. But I don't want people thinking we're robo-sexuals, so if anyone asks, you're my debugger."
98,FRY,"Oh, no, it's the Cyclops!  Don't look! Don't look!"
99,BENDER,I'm not looking!
100,LEELA,This is officer 1B-DI requesting back-up.
101,SMITTY,We'll be there in five minutes.
102,BENDER,"We can hide in here, it's free on Tuesdays."
103,NIMOY,Welcome to the Head Museum. I'm Leonard Nimoy.
104,FRY,Spock? Hey! Do the thing!
105,NIMOY,I don't do that anymore.
106,FRY,This is unbelievable! What do you heads do all day?
107,NIMOY,We share our wisdom with those who seek it. It's a life of quiet dignity.
108,WOMAN,Feeding time!
109,URL.],
110,LEELA,Hmm.
111,LEELA,"I'm sorry, Fry, but I have to install your career chip."
112,FRY,"Yeah, well, if you're sorry why are you doing it?"
113,LEELA,It's my job. You gotta do what you gotta do!
114,LEELA,Watch it!
115,NIXON,That's it! You just made my list!
116,FRY,Ow! Stoppit! Down boy! Bad president!
117,SMITTY,"Alright, buddy, step away from the head!"
118,URL,I'm gonna get 24th century on his ass!
119,LEELA,"Please, officers, there's no need to use force."
120,URL,"Let us handle this, weirdy."
121,LEELA,"Oh, come on, he's just a poor kid from the Stupid Ages."
122,SMITTY,"Keep your big nose out of this, eyeball!"
123,LEELA,No-one makes fun of my nose.
124,URL,Damn!
125,LEELA,You guys were totally out of control.
126,SMITTY,It's our job. We're peace officers.
127,URL,"Yeah, you know the law: You gotta do what you gotta do."
128,BENDER,"Oh, we're trapped!"
129,FRY,"Wait a second. You're a bender, right? We can get out of here if you just bend the bars."
130,BENDER,"Dream on, skin tube. I'm only programmed to bend for constructive purposes. What do I look like, a de-bender?"
131,FRY,Who cares what you're programmed for. If someone programmed you to jump off a bridge would you do it?
132,BENDER,I'll have to check my program...yep.
133,LEELA,Open up!
134,FRY,"C'mon, Bender! It's up to you to make your own decisions in life. That's what separates people and robots from animals...and animal robots."
135,BENDER,"You're full of crap, Fry!  You make a persuasive argument, Fry."
136,FRY,"Come on, Bender! You can do it."
137,BENDER,Can't...I...can't...do...it!
138,FRY,Yes!
139,BENDER,"You were right, Fry! From now on I'm going to bend what I want, when I want, who I want! I'm unstoppable!"
140,FRY,I don't know how you did that.
141,LEELA,Wait!
142,BENDER,"(shouting) No, thanks."
143,BENDER,Looks like one of us will have to bend this grate.
144,FRY,Good Lord! What is this?
145,BENDER,"It's the decaying ruins of Old New York. Welcome home, pal!"
146,FRY,"Its my old neighbourhood. Man, this brings back a lot of memories."
147,BENDER,"Keep 'em to yourself, pops."
148,FRY,This is where I brought my girlfriend on our very first date.
149,FRY,My God! She's gone. Everyone I ever knew or cared about is gone.
150,BENDER,Wait! There's someone you know!
151,FRY,"Oh, can't you leave me alone? I'm miserable enough already."
152,LEELA,"Look, I know it's not much consolation but I understand how you feel."
153,FRY,"No, you don't. I've got no home, no family..."
154,BENDER,No friends.
155,FRY,...My whole world is gone. You can't possibly understand what it feels like to be so alone.
156,LEELA,I understand. I'm the only one-eyed alien on this whole planet. My parents abandoned me here as a baby and I don't even know what galaxy they were from. I know how it feels to be alone.
157,FRY,"Look, Leela, I don't understand this world but you obviously do, so I give up. If you really think I should be a delivery boy, I'll do it.  Your chip. What are you doing?"
158,LEELA,Quitting.
159,FRY,Why?
160,LEELA,Because I've always wanted to. I just never realised it before I met you.
161,FRY,What is the matter with you?
162,BENDER,I just wanted to be part of the moment.
163,LEELA,"Hey, he stole my ring!"
164,BENDER,"Sorry.  Well, that solves the mystery of the missing ring. This calls for a drink."
165,LEELA,I don't wanna spoil the party but we're all job deserters now. We're unemployed and we have nowhere to go.
166,FRY,Correction. We're unemployed but we have a doddering old relative to mooch off of.
167,CLARK [ON TV],"Hello, I'm Dick Clark's head. Welcome to a special year 3000 edition of New Year's Rockin' Eve!"
168,FARNSWORTH,Who are you?
169,FRY,I'm your dear old Uncle Fry.
170,FARNSWORTH,I don't have an Uncle Fry.
171,BENDER,You do now!
172,FARNSWORTH,"By God, I am your nephew! This is absolutely incredible!"
173,BENDER,Can we have some money?
174,FARNSWORTH,"Oh, my, no."
175,FARNSWORTH,Let me show you around. That's my lab table and this is my work-stool. And over there is my intergalactic spaceship! And here's where I keep assorted lengths of wire.
176,FRY,Whoa! A real live spaceship!
177,FARNSWORTH,I designed it myself. Let me show you some of the different lengths of wire I used.
178,SMITTY,"Attention, job deserters! Come out with your hands up. We have you partially surrounded."
179,FRY,No!
180,NIXON,Get those bums!
181,BENDER,"Well, we're boned!"
182,LEELA,Can't we get away in the ship?
183,FARNSWORTH,I suppose it is technically possible. Though I am already in my pyjamas.
184,FRY,I'll get us out of here.
185,FARNSWORTH,Can anyone drive stick?
186,LEELA,I can. As long as I don't have to parallel park.
187,URL,"If they try to take off, give 'em an ass-ful of laser."
188,LEELA,Prepare for lift-off. Ten.
189,CROWD,Nine!
190,CROWD,Amania!
191,CROWD,Seven!
192,ALIENS,(in alien) Six.
193,TERRY,(dramatically) Five!
194,NIMOY,Four.
195,FARNSWORTH,Three.
196,BENDER,Two.
197,LEELA,One!
198,FRY,Blast-off!
199,NIXON,Fire! Fire!
200,SMITTY,I can't see nothing. Pretty though!
201,FRY,"So I guess without jobs, we'll be fugitives forever."
202,FARNSWORTH,"Not necessarily. Are you three, by any chance, interested in becoming my new spaceship crew?"
203,BENDER,New crew? W-What happened to the old crew?
204,FARNSWORTH,Of those poor sons of -- but that's not important. The important thing is I need a new crew. Anyone interested?
205,FRY,Yes! Yes! That's exactly the job I've always wanted!
206,LEELA,"Thanks for the offer, Professor, but we don't have the proper career chips."
207,FARNSWORTH,"Oh, that won't be a problem. As luck would have it I saved the chips from my previous crew."
208,FRY,This is awesome! Are we gonna fly through space fighting monsters and teaching alien women to lurve?
209,FARNSWORTH,"If by that you mean ""transporting cargo"" then yes. It's a little home business I started to fund my research."
210,FRY,Cool! What's my job gonna be?
211,FARNSWORTH,You will be responsible for ensuring that the cargo reaches its destination.
212,FRY,"So, I'm gonna be a delivery boy?"
213,FARNSWORTH,Exactly!
214,FRY,Alright! I'm a delivery boy!
215,THE END,
216,"""THE SERIES HAS LANDED""",
217,FARNSWORTH,As new employees I'd like your opinion on our commercial. I paid to have it air during the Superbowl.
218,FRY,Wow!
219,FARNSWORTH,"Not on the same channel, of course."
220,ANNOUNCER,Interplanetary deliveries - what a headache!
221,MAN,Uh... (shouting) I'm not Evans!
222,ANNOUNCER,"When those other companies aren't brave or foolhardy enough to go, trust Planet Express for reliable, on time delivery."
223,EVANS,"Here's your package, Mr. Horrible Gelatinous Blob."
224,EVANS,"Thank you, sir!"
225,ANNOUNCER,Planet Express: Our crew is replaceable. Your package isn't.
226,FRY,Are there really giant birds like that?
227,FARNSWORTH,"No, no! That was all just special effects! Now let's have breakfast. I hope everyone likes eggs."
228,FRY,I'm never going to get used to the 31st century.  Caffinated bacon? Baconated grapefruit? Admiral Crunch?
229,LEELA,"Well, if you don't like that try some Archduke Chocula."
230,FARNSWORTH,"Ah, Hermes! Crew, meet Hermes Conrad. He manages my delivery business, pays the bills, notifies next of kin, what have you."
231,HERMES,Someone come and dropped this package through the slot last night. Now which one of you is the captain?
232,FARNSWORTH,"Oh, my! I haven't picked a new captain yet. It's always so hard to choose."
233,FARNSWORTH,"Hmm, you!"
234,HERMES,"OK, Captain, this is just a standard legal release protecting Planet Express from lawsuits in the event of the unforeseen."
235,LEELA,(reading) Death by airlock failure.
236,HERMES,Mmm.
237,LEELA,(reading) Death by brain parasite.
238,HERMES,Yeah.
239,LEELA,(reading) Death by sonic diarrhoea?
240,HERMES,"(chuckling) Oh, you don't want that!"
241,LEELA,"Look, I don't know about any of your previous captains but I intend to do as little dying as possible."
242,HERMES,Sign the paper!
243,FARNSWORTH,"Now Fry, before you go into space you'll need to see our staff doctor. I should warn you though, he's a little unusual. (whispering) He wears sandals!"
244,FRY,Hi -- eurgh!
245,FARNSWORTH,"Dr. Zoidberg, this is Fry, the new delivery boy. He needs a physical."
246,ZOIDBERG,"Excellent, excellent!"
247,FARNSWORTH,You'll be fine.
248,ZOIDBERG,Now open your mouth and let's have a look at that brain.  No no no no no not that mouth!
249,FRY,I only have one.
250,ZOIDBERG,Really?
251,FRY,"Uh, is there a human doctor around?"
252,ZOIDBERG,"Young lady, I'm an expert on humans. Now pick a mouth, open it and say... What? My mother was a saint! Get out!"
253,FARNSWORTH,"Dear Lord, Bender, you're filthy."
254,BENDER,"Yeah, like you don't have crap in your neck!"
255,FARNSWORTH,"Amy, why don't you give his body a going over with the cleaning pick?"
256,AMY,OK. Does it hurt when I go like this?
257,LEELA,Ow!
258,BENDER,A little.
259,FRY,"Well, the doctor says I'm as healthy as a crab. Can I go into space now?"
260,FARNSWORTH,"As soon as we finish cleaning Bender. Oh, and Fry, this is our intern, Amy Wong. She's an engineering student of mine. (whispering) I like having her around because she's the same blood type as me."
261,AMY,"Hey! You're the unfrozen guy! From the 20th century, right?"
262,FRY,(chuffed) Last time I checked.
263,LEELA,Hang on. Amy Wong? Of the Mars Wongs?
264,AMY,Look. We're not as rich as everybody says.
265,LEELA,Uh-huh! What sorority do you belong to?
266,AMY,(ashamed) Kappa Kappa Wong.
267,BENDER,"Hey, rich girl. Look over here! It's me, Bender. I'm being entertaining. (singing) La la la look at my head. It's all painted look at my head! I got a big old head, hey! Ho! (talking) Alright, show's over, I'm tired."
268,FARNSWORTH,"Ah, to be young again. And also a robot! Now as I recall you youngsters have a package to deliver."
269,FRY,"Finally! Come on Bender, let's mosey!"
270,BENDER,"Nice catch, idiot!"
271,FRY,So where are we going anyway?
272,LEELA,Nowhere special. The moon.
273,FRY,The moon? The moon moon? Wow! I'm gonna be a famous hero just like Neil Armstrong and those other brave guys no one ever heard of!
274,AMY,"Oh, I love stuff like the moon! Can I come, Leela?"
275,LEELA,Well...I guess so. Just be careful. I'd like to hold off any major screwups until at least my second day as captain.
276,FANSWORTH,Nothing will go wrong.  (whispering) If something goes wrong bring back the blood.
277,FRY,Can I do the countdown?
278,LEELA,"Huh? Oh sure, knock yourself out."
279,FRY,Ten......nine --
280,LEELA,OK we're here!
281,FRY,"Hurry up, I wanna see the moon!"
282,LEELA,"Relax, its open till 9."
283,FRY,That's one small step for Fry --
284,MAN,And one giant line for admission!
285,FRY,"Wow!  Um, can I have cuts?"
286,MAN,Hmm -- No!
287,FRY,You're not gonna believe this but they landed an amusement park on the moon!
288,AMY,Guh! It's the happiest place orbiting Earth.
289,FRY,"Lets go, already!"
290,LEELA,"Fry, we have a crate to deliver."
291,FRY,Let's just dump it in the sewer and say we delivered it.
292,BENDER,Too much work. Lets burn it and say we dumped it in the sewer.
293,LEELA,"OK, if everyone's finished being stupid --"
294,FRY,I had more but you go ahead.
295,LEELA,We'll deliver that crate like professionals and then we'll go home.
296,FRY,But I've never been to the moon before.
297,LEELA,"Alright. We'll deliver that crate like professionals...and then we'll go ride the bumper cars.  Amy, why don't you help Fry hoist down the crate. Then lock up when you're done. Just be careful."
298,AMY,"Aye, aye, Captain! I mean only one eye. I mean, yes, sir, um, ma'am!"
299,AMY,Clear?
300,FRY,Clear!
301,AMY,Ready to hoist?
302,FRY,Ready!
303,AMY,Ow!
304,FRY,My first space delivery.
305,FRY,"Uh, greetings, Moon Man, we come in peace. I am Fry from the planet Earth."
306,SAL,"Wise guy, huh? If I wasn't so lazy I'd punch you in the stomach."
307,FRY,"But you are lazy, right?"
308,SAL,"Oh, don't get me started."
309,CRATER FACE,"Hi, I'm Crater Face! Welcome to Luna Park. I'll have to confiscate your alcohol, sir."
310,BENDER,Better mascots than you have tried.
311,CRATER FACE,At least I still have my self respect!
312,LEELA,Who buys this trash?
313,BENDER,Idiots who need gifts for other idiots.
314,FRY,"Hey, I got you guys refrigerator magnets."
315,BENDER,"Get it off! Get it off! Get it -- uh oh!  (singing) How many roads must a man walk down, before you... (talking) Keep those things off of me! Magnets screw up my inhibition unit!"
316,FRY,So you flip out and start acting like some crazy folk singer?
317,BENDER,Yes. I guess a robot would have to be crazy to wanna be a folk singer.
318,WHALERBOTS,"(singing) We're whalers on the moon,"
319,WHALERBOT,"Bender, hey, Bender! Over here!"
320,BENDER,"Oh, jeez, I went to high school with that guy!"
321,ANNOUNCER,Monsanto presents: The Goophy Gopher Revue!
322,GOPHER #1,Why does a moon rock taste better than an Earth rock?
323,GOPHER #2,Because it's a little meteor!
324,FRY,This is weak!
325,GOPHER #1,Address all complaints to the Monsanto Corporation.
326,LEELA,"What's wrong, Fry?"
327,FRY,"I don't know. This place is great and all but its just so artificial. The gravity, the air, the gophers. You might as well stay on Earth.  That's what I came to see! I wanna go out there and jump around like an astronaut. Screw this phoney stuff!"
328,LEELA,But the phoney stuff is what's fun. It's boring out there.
329,BENDER,Yeah! You're the kind of guy who visits Jerusalem and doesn't want to see the Sexeteria!
330,LEELA,Maybe I should take Fry on the Luna Rover ride. You get to wear a space suit and drive around on the surface. And the line's short because it's educational.
331,FRY,I don't care how educational it is. Let's do it!
332,BENDER,(shouting) Next year in Jerusalem!
333,FRY,Finally! Get ready for some serious moon action.
334,NARRATOR,(voice-over) The story of lunar exploration started with one man. A man with a dream.
335,RALPH KRAMDENBOT,"One of these days, Alice. Bang! Zoom! Straight to the moon!"
336,LEELA,"Wow, I never realised the first astronauts were so fat!"
337,FRY,"That's not an astronaut, it's a TV comedian. And he was just using space travel as a metaphor for beating his wife."
338,AMY,Wow! I could swear I was really playing virtual skeeball!  Hm?
339,BENDER,"Look, it's that crate we were gonna throw in the sewer."
340,AMY,The keys to the ship!  They must have fallen into the crate! Leela's gonna kill me!
341,BENDER,Nah. She'll probably make me do it.
342,AMY,Mister? Could you please get those keys out for me?
343,SAL,What do I look like? A guy who's not lazy?
344,NARRATOR,"(voice-over) No one knows where, when or how Man first landed on the moon..."
345,FRY,I do.
346,NARRATOR,(voice-over) ...but our fungineers think it might have happened something like this:
347,WHALERBOTS,"(singing) We're whalers on the moon,"
348,GOPHERS,"(singing) We carry a harpoon,"
349,LEELA,(singing) ...and sing a whaling tune. We're whalers on the moon...
350,FRY,That's not how it happened.
351,LEELA,"Oh, really? I don't see you with a fungineering degree! p>"
352,FRY,This is stupid. I'm taking this thing out to the real moon.
353,LEELA,"Fry, no. This is my first mission and I'm not gonna let us get in any trouble. Besides, the car's on a track."
354,FRY,Not for long!
355,WHALERBOT,Ooh aah! I died doin' what I loved.
356,LEELA,"OK, you're on the surface. Now I'll give you 10 minutes. Then you'll get bored, turn around and apologise for being such a jerk. Agreed?"
357,FRY,Agreed.  Yee-haw! Woo! Yeah! Crank up the radio!
358,WHALERBOTS,We're whalers on the -
359,FRY,Yee-haw!
360,LEELA,Time's up. Make a U-turn at the next crater.
361,FRY,No not yet. How 'bout we go look for the original moon landing site?
362,LEELA,That's crazy! It's been lost for centuries!
363,FRY,Well I'm feelin' lucky!  Uh... I'm ready to go back now.
364,FRY,"We're gonna die! It's every man for himself!  Help me, Leela!  You did it! We're safe!"
365,LEELA,No. Now we're gonna die.
366,FRY,It's every man for himself.
367,BENDER,"Hey, look what I won from a tourist's pocket!"
368,AMY,Shut up. You're distracting me.
369,BENDER,"Come on, it's just like making love. Y'know: Left, down, rotate 62 degrees, engage rotor."
370,AMY,I know how to make love!
371,BENDER,"Here, let me do it.  Ah, lousy arm. Must be rigged!  That's her, officers! Uh, that's the woman who programmed me for evil!"
372,BENDER,"Yeah, well, I'm gonna go build my own theme park, with blackjack and hookers. In fact, forget the park!"
373,FRY,"(gasping) I'm sorry, Leela, I can't go on any further. Just leave me to die in that barn over there."
374,LEELA,Thank God!
375,FARMER,"Trespassers, eh?"
376,FRY,"No, sir. We're amusement park patrons."
377,FARMER,"Ooh, that's a wicked sinful place. Tilt-a-whirl's OK, but the rest is mighty wicked."
378,LEELA,Our car broke down and we're out of oxygen. Can we borrow some?
379,FARMER,"Huh, borry? Looky here, city girl, oxygen don't grow on trees. You'll have to earn it doing chores on my hydroponic farm. You can go back to your precious theme park at sun up."
380,FRY,I guess we could do chores for a few hours.
381,LEELA,"Fry, night lasts two weeks on the moon."
382,FARMER,Yup. Drops down to -173!
383,FRY,Fahrenheit or Celsius?
384,FARMER,"First one, then th'other. And them spacesuits ain't a-heated so you ain’t goin' nowhere til sunrise. You can sleep in the barn. Just don't be a-touchin' my three beautiful robot daughters. Y'hear?"
385,FRY,Robot daughters?
386,FARMER,This here is Lulabelle 7.
387,LULABELLE 7,Yoo-hoo!
388,FARMER,Daisy-Mae 128K.
389,DAISY-MAE 128K,Yoo-hoo!
390,FARMER,And the Crushinator.
391,CRUSHINATOR,(mechanical voice) Yoo-hoo.
392,FRY,Whoa!
393,LEELA,"I told you to turn around and go back to the park. But oh, no, the park was too phoney. We had to see the real moon."
394,FRY,"And it was great! We got to see craters and rocks and that one incredible rock that looked like a crater and, and these fellas."
395,LEELA,"Fry, face it. The moon is a dump. It's a boring dried up wasteland. And the only reason anybody ever comes here is for the tacky little amusement park. Can't you just accept that?"
396,FRY,I guess I can't.
397,FARMER,I'll learn ye to sleep with my robot daughters!
398,BENDER,He'll never find me in here.
399,LEELA,Bender?
400,FRY,"Oh, Bender. You didn't touch the Crushinator, did you?"
401,BENDER,Of course not. A lady that fine you gotta romance first.
402,FARMER,"Oh, no you don't! C'mere Crushinator."
403,CRUSHINATOR,"(mechanical voice) Yes, Pa."
404,FRY,It's too low.
405,LEELA,Hang on. Hang on. Jump.  Hold on to your helmet!
406,FARMER,"God darn, it Crushinator, jump!"
407,CRUSHINATOR,"(mechanical voice) No, Pa. I love him."
408,FRY,"Hey, cool! Dark side of the moon!"
409,LEELA,"Nightfall's coming.  Hurry, before we freeze."
410,BENDER,"What do you mean ""we"", mammal?"
411,FARNSWORTH,"Oh, dear! I really ought to do something. But I am already in my pyjamas."
412,LEELA,We can't outrun it forever.
413,FRY,Over there! Look! It's the moon landing site! We found it!
414,LEELA,"Quick, get in."
415,FRY,"It's that flag from MTV! And Neil Armstrong's footprint!  Hey! My foot's bigger! Leela, isn't this the greatest thing you've ever seen?"
416,LEELA,"Fry, look around. It's just a crummy plastic flag and a dead man's tracks in the dust.  Now get in here before you freeze."
417,BENDER,"Oh, no room for Bender, huh? Fine! I'll go build my own lunar lander, with blackjack and hookers. In fact, forget the lunar lander and the blackjack. Ah, screw the whole thing."
418,LEELA,Well if the oxygen holds out we might live long enough to starve to death.
419,FRY,"Look, Leela, I'm sorry. I never should have dragged you out here."
420,LEELA,"That's right, you shouldn't have. I still don't get what the big attraction is."
421,FRY,I never told anybody this but a thousand years ago I used to look up at the moon and dream about being an astronaut. I just didn't have the grades. Nor the physical endurance. Plus I threw up a lot and nobody liked spending a week with me.
422,LEELA,A week would be a little much.
423,FRY,"The moon was like this awesome, romantic, mysterious thing, hanging up there in the sky where you could never reach it, no matter how much you wanted to. But you're right. Once you're actually here it's just a big dull rock. I guess I just wanted you to see it through my eyes, the way I used to."
424,LEELA,"Fry, look. It really is beautiful. I don't know why I never noticed before."
425,FARMER,"Had to come back for the Crushinator, eh, robot? Well I got you this time."
426,FRY,It's Amy! We're saved!
427,LEELA,Amy? Where'd she learn to operate the controls like that?
428,BENDER,Not the magnet! No! No! Nooo --  Uh-oh!
429,BENDER,"(singing) She'll be comin' round the mountain when she comes,"
430,FARMER,"Aww, dang it!"
431,BENDER,"(singing) She'll be riding six white horses when she comes,"
432,LEELA,"So, Fry, was the real moon anything like the moon you used to dream about?"
433,FRY,"Well, close enough!"
434,THE END,
435,BENDER,"Well I'll shoot her with my ray gun when she comes,"
436,FUTURAMA,
437,"""I, ROBOT""",
438,BENDER,Hey!
439,HERMES,"Fry, mon, if you're going to be living in the office you could at least be on time for work."
440,FRY,I'm sorry. I was up really late poking through people's desks.
441,HERMES,"Alright, people. I will now outline today's 12-point agenda. We'll begin with point one then race forward --"
442,HERMES,"Concerning our pest problem: Somebody's been leaving food around and it's attracting owls. And I, for one, am getting tired of cleaning those owl traps.  Now......as this shocking graph indicates, our water consumption has tripled in the last month. I notice Fry has been here for a month, so I'm appointing him head of a committee to find who's responsible. Fry?  Am I cracking up, or is Fry's living here starting to get in the way of bus -"
443,LEELA,What the hell are you doing?! You're getting a huge dose of radiation!
444,FRY,And great lift!
445,LEELA,Do you know how long it's going to take me to recalibrate these engines?
446,FRY,"Hey, when you look this good, you don't have to know anything."
447,LEELA,"Professor, We need to talk to you about Fry."
448,BENDER,"That's right, we want some money -- wait, what's this about Fry?"
449,LEELA,He's a nice guy but we think it's about time he got his own place.
450,FARNSWORTH,"Oh, fuff! He's not causing any trouble. Now, if you don't mind, I'm rather busy. I seem to have mislaid my alien mummy. This sarcophagus should contain the remains of Emperor Nimballa, who ruled Zubin 5 over 29 million years ago."
451,FRY,"Hey, Professor, great jerky!"
452,FARNSWORTH,"My God, this is an outrage! I was going to eat that mummy! Fry has got to go!"
453,TV.],
454,ANNOUNCER,Bachelor chow: Now with flavour!
455,COMMENTATOR,And Bigfoot is down!
456,FRY,"Sheesh! 40,000 channels and only 150 have anything good on."
457,ANNOUNCER,"All My Circuits is brought to you by Robo Fresh: Designed by a robot, for a robot."
458,CALCULON,"I've been processing this for some time, Monique, and well, will you marry me?"
459,MONIQUE,"Oh, Calculon!  It fits! Then you must know that I'm --"
460,CALCULON,"Metric? I've always known. But for you, my darling, I'm willing to convert."
461,FRY,"Hmm, must be a friend of theirs."
462,BENDER,"Fry, we've got to discuss your living arrangements."
463,LEELA,We've all talked it over and --
464,BENDER,"Hey, All My Circuits! Move over.  Ahh!"
465,LEELA,"Fry, sometimes in close quarters, people do inconsiderate things without realising it."
466,FRY,I know but I forgive you.
467,LEELA,"No, Fry, by ""close quarters"" I mean this office..."
468,FRY,Uh-huh.
469,LEELA,"...and by ""people"" I mean you!"
470,FRY,Right.
471,LEELA,"And by ""inconsiderate"" I mean --"
472,FRY,Leela! We're trying to watch TV.
473,BENDER,"Yeah, would you kindly shut your noise hole?"
474,FRY,"So, who's that weird-looking guy?"
475,BENDER,That's a human.
476,FRY,What's he do?
477,BENDER,"Eh, the usual human stuff. He laughs, he learns, he loves."
478,FRY,Boring!
479,HUMAN FRIEND,Calculon? I thought you were in a coma.
480,CALCULON,"That's what I wanted you to think with your soft, human brain."
481,FRY,"Hey, uh, why is the TV getting smaller?"
482,HERMES,We'll bill you for the couch.
483,BENDER,"Cheer up, meatbag, you've barely touched your amoeba."
484,FRY,It looked good but I just don't feel like eating. You want it?
485,BENDER,"Nah, I'm trying to watch my input. I need plenty of wholesome, nutritious alcohol.  The chemical energy keeps my fuel cells charged."
486,FRY,What are the cigars for?
487,BENDER,They make me look cool.
488,FRY,I can't believe they threw me out like that. I must have been really acting like a jerk.
489,BENDER,"Yeah, but everybody's a jerk. You, me, this jerk.  That's my philosophy. So, where you gonna stay?"
490,FRY,I don't know. Do refrigerators still come in cardboard boxes?
491,BENDER,"Yeah, but the rents are outrageous. Why don't you just come move in with me?"
492,FRY,Really? That'd be great! You sure I won't be imposing?
493,BENDER,"Nah, I've always wanted a pet."
494,BENDER,Here we are. Your new home.
495,FRY,"Cool! Y'know, I've never even seen a robot's apartment before."
496,BENDER,"Come on in, I'll give you the tour!"
497,BENDER,"Let's see, where to start. OK, this is the TV area, that over there's the breakfast nook, and over here is where you'll be living which is great because, until now, it's just been wasted space."
498,FRY,It's kinda cramped in here. I don't even have room to hang my clothes.
499,BENDER,"Look, pal, you've only got one set of clothes and you're not taking them off while I'm here. Well, I'm bushed. G'night."
500,FRY,"Wait, Bender. Bender?"
501,BENDER,(sleep-talking) Kill all humans...kill all humans...must kill all the humans.
502,FRY,"Bender, wake up!"
503,BENDER,I was having the most wonderful dream. I think you were in it.
504,FRY,"Uh, listen, Bender, uh, where's your bathroom?"
505,BENDER,Bath what?
506,FRY,Bathroom.
507,BENDER,What room?
508,FRY,Bathroom!
509,BENDER,What what?
510,FRY,"Ah, never mind!"
511,BENDER,"(sleep-talking) Hey, sexy mama...wanna kill all the humans?"
512,LEELA,We sure are cheerful this morning.
513,BENDER,"Yeah, this past week with Fry's been a blast! Y'know, beneath this warm, sunny exterior, beats the cold, mechanical heart of a robot."
514,LEELA,What happened to you?
515,FRY,"Oh, it's Bender's apartment. He put in carpeting yesterday so now my head hits the ceiling. Hey, do you realise you're standing at a weird angle?  Now you're OK."
516,LEELA,Look at yourself. You're a wreck! You've got to find a new place to live.
517,FRY,(sexily) Is that an invitation?
518,LEELA,"Love your optimism, Fry. But seriously, you've got to tell Bender you're moving out."
519,FRY,"Yeah, but he might get kind of upset. I don't think I can do that to him."
520,BENDER,"Hey, there's my little space heater."
521,FRY,"Well, I'm moving out!"
522,BENDER,What?!
523,FRY,"I'm sorry, Bender, but there's just not enough room."
524,BENDER,Not enough room? My place is two cubic metres and we only take up 1.5 cubic metres. We've got room for a whole nother two-thirds of a person.
525,LEELA,What if I just helped the two of you find a bigger apartment?
526,BENDER,I don't know. I've got a lot of great memories in my old place.  And now they're gone.
527,LANDLORD #1,"Sure, it ain't one of them la-de-da above-ground places. But if you like dank, hey, forget about it!"
528,LEELA,At least it's got a great view.
529,BENDER,What the?
530,LANDLORD #1,"Excuse me, I gotta go change a lightbulb."
531,LEELA,Wow! Now this is fantastic!
532,FRY,"Hmm, I'm not sure we want to pay for a dimension we're not going to use."
533,FRY,"Well, I give up. What's the catch?"
534,LANDLORD #3,"Oh, no catch. Although we are technically in New Jersey."
535,FRY,Not one place even remotely liveable.
536,FARNSWORTH,"Oh, how awful. Did he at least die painlessly...? To shreds, you say. Well, how is his wife holding up...? To shreds, you say. Very well then.  Sad, sad, terrible, gruesome news about my colleague, Dr. Mobootu."
537,LEELA,Was his apartment rent-controlled?
538,LEELA,"Wow, this is beautiful."
539,BENDER,What's with all the crap?
540,LEELA,It's not crap.
541,HATTIE,Dr. Mobootu collected this crap while he was exploring the watcha-call-it...universe!
542,FRY,"Well, this place has everything except the only thing I care about: A TV."
543,HATTIE,"It's got a TV, you young watcha-call-it...idiot!"
544,TV.],
545,FRY,Ooh!
546,BENDER,"Whoa, slow down! This place just doesn't feel like home. It just isn't...cosy. Ahh, I can barely move.   It's perfect!"
547,FRY,"Man, it's a total sty! For the first time in a thousand years, I feel like I'm home."
548,BENDER,"Yeah! It's gonna be fun on the bun! Y'know Fry, of all the friends I've had, you're the first."
549,HERMES,"Hey, mon!"
550,LEELA,"Happy housewarming, Fry!  It's a miniature fruit salad tree."
551,FRY,"Ooh!  Hey, Amy!"
552,AMY,Hey!
553,FARNSWORTH,"This is for you, Fry  Zevulon the Great. He's teriyaki style."
554,BENDER,"Wow, heavy drinking crowd!  I'd better go out for more beer."
555,FRY,"Hey, hang on, All My Circuits is about to start!"
556,BENDER,"I know, but I need alcohol to power up my batteries. If Calculon's wedding doesn't go just right I'll be emotionally and electrically drained."
557,FRY,Hey!
558,HERMES,These are mighty tasty!
559,ZOIDBERG,"Thank you, I made them myself."
560,FRY,"Shh, the wedding's about to start!"
561,PRIESTBOT,"If anyone here objects to this union, let them speak now or forever hold their --"
562,FRY,Is he objecting or backing up?
563,AMY,Looks like both.
564,CALCULON,"I'm afraid my half-brother is correct. You see, I have a terrible secret and that secret is --"
565,AMY,"Oh, this isn't right."
566,HERMES,"Oh, come on!"
567,FARNSWORTH,Fix it!
568,BENDER,Hey what happened to the TV?
569,FRY,It just went out.
570,BENDER,This is an outrage! I'm gonna go yell at the manager!
571,HERMES,Alright!
572,FRY,"(shouting) Come back, Bender, its working!"
573,CALCULON,"To reiterate, my terrible secret is --"
574,FRY,It's out again.
575,BENDER,What? That's the last straw!
576,FRY,It's back on!
577,HATTIE,Pardon me. I don't mean to pry into what you're doing in here with the crab and the one-eyed lady and the Chinese girl but everyone on this floor is having trouble with their TV reception.
578,BENDER,Yeah! And you'd better get rid of whatever's causing it or we're outta this dump!
579,HATTIE,"Relax, sonny. This kajigger'll find the source of the interference."
580,TENANT #1,What's going on?
581,TENANT #2,We want our TV back!
582,HATTIE,There's your problem.
583,AMY,"Oh, my God, Bender, it's your thingy!"
584,RANDY,Then get rid of it!
585,TENANT #1,Get out!
586,BENDER,You people are nuts. My antenna never interfered with my old TV.
587,LEELA,You had cable. This is satellite.
588,FARNSWORTH,Obviously your thoughts are being transmitted on the same frequency.
589,TENANT #2,They're on my cell phone too.
590,BENDER,"Madam, I believe you're mistaken!"
591,BENDER,"Wow, that lady's got a huge ass!"
592,BENDER,"Those could be anyone's thoughts, fat ass!"
593,RANDY,The robot has to go!
594,TENANT #1,Yeah.
595,TENANT #3,Get him out of here!
596,HATTIE,"Well, you heard the mob!"
597,BENDER,"Fine! Come on, Fry, let's move to that apartment that smelled like a sewer. You liked that one, right?"
598,FRY,"It's tempting, but, well, I am already kinda settled in here."
599,BENDER,Or we could live underground with the mutants. A little fire'll show 'em who's boss!
600,FRY,"Uh, listen, is there maybe some way we could do this with you going and me not going?"
601,BENDER,I don't understand.
602,FRY,"Well, you were gonna live in the closet anyway. Won't you be just as happy back in your old place?"
603,BENDER,"But, then we wouldn't be roommates."
604,FRY,I'll come visit sometime. And you can visit me here.
605,HATTIE,No he can't.
606,FRY,"Anyway, I'm sure it'll work out. This way we'll both be happy."
607,BENDER,"(downbeat) Happy. Yeah, that's Bender. Always happy."
608,RANDY,"Hey, the TV's back on!"
609,PRIESTBOT,"We are gathered here to mourn the death of Calculon; Industrialist, private eye, friend."
610,CALCULON,Mind if I give the eulogy?
611,MONIQUE,Calculon! You're alive!
612,RANDY,Calculon's back!
613,FARNSWORTH,"Right, so long."
614,ZOIDBERG,Goodbye.
615,AMY,(crying) Do you think Calculon's evil twin will ever walk again?
616,HERMES,"I don't know, Amy. I just don't know."
617,FRY,"Hey, thanks for coming."
618,LEELA,"Fry, you're Bender's best friend. How could you let that mob kick him out?"
619,FRY,"Ah, come on. Bender loves mobs."
620,LEELA,Only when he's in them and you know it. You really hurt his feelings.
621,FRY,Don't girl me with that girl stuff. Bender and me are guys. Guys don't have feelings.
622,LEELA,"Bender's not a guy, he's a robot."
623,FRY,Same thing.
624,BENDER,It's so big and empty.
625,BENDER,"My roommate's gone. And all he left behind was an eyelash and three skin flakes.  Oh, what's the point?!"
626,LEELA,"Bender?  My God, you're a mess!"
627,BENDER,Leave me alone!
628,LEELA,"Look at that five o'clock rust. You've been up all night not drinking, haven't you?"
629,BENDER,Hey. What I don't do is none of your business.
630,LEELA,"Please, Bender. Have some malt liquor. If not for yourself then for the people who love you."
631,BENDER,I hate the people who love me and they hate me.
632,LEELA,"Oh, now look. It's obvious you miss being Fry's roommate. But there's got to be a better way to deal with this."
633,BENDER,Like how? Having my antenna removed?
634,LEELA,"Well, if that would work."
635,BENDER,Are you crazy? That's Little Bender you're talking about. I can't cut it off. You're not a robot or a man so you wouldn't understand. I gotta get out of here.
636,LEELA,Wait! I want you to look me in the eye and promise you won't get behind the wheel without some kind of alcoholic beverage in your hand.
637,BENDER,I promise nothing!
638,FRY,What up?
639,LEELA,I can't just stand by and be silent about Bender anymore.
640,FRY,Silent? You've been meddling for two solid weeks.
641,LEELA,Well I can't just do that anymore. Your best friend is out there somewhere destroying himself.
642,FRY,Really? I didn't think he'd miss this apartment that much.
643,LEELA,"He doesn't care about the apartment, he cares about you. And you turned your back on him."
644,FRY,"Oh, man. I had no idea. If only I knew where he was I'd go talk to him."
645,FRY,"Oh, stupid TV!  Bender! You're blind stinking sober!"
646,BENDER,That's right! I'm sober and crazy and I don't know what I might do!
647,FRY,Don't do it!
648,BENDER,"I don't know what it is yet. Oh, yeah, now I remember. I thought I could live alone, but I can't. So, I'm gonna do what it takes to be your roommate again."
649,LEELA,Bender! Stop!
650,FRY,Cutting Leela's head off won't solve anything!
651,BENDER,"No, I'm going to chop off my antenna."
652,FRY,"Hey, yeah! That sounds good. Can I give you a hand?"
653,LEELA,"Fry, don't help him mutilate himself."
654,FRY,But it's a useless antenna. It's not like he's a ham radio or something.
655,BENDER,I'm gonna do it! I'm really gonna do it! Don't try and stop me! Here goes.
656,FRY,"Hey, it works! The static's gone."
657,HUMAN FRIEND,"I hate that this came between us, Calculon."
658,CALCULON,Me too. I'm filled with a large number of powerful emotions.
659,HUMAN FRIEND,You're my best friend. I'm sorry I treated you so badly.
660,CALCULON,"Apology accepted. After all, you're only human."
661,LEELA,You guys could learn a lesson from those two.
662,FRY,She's right.
663,BENDER,"You're my best friend, Fry, I'm sorry I treated you so badly."
664,FRY,"Apology accepted. After all, you're only human."
665,LEELA,"Wait a minute! You did it all backwards. Fry's the one who should be......Oh, never mind!"
666,FRY,What's wrong?
667,BENDER,Nothing. I guess I'm just going to have to get used to being half a robot.
668,FRY,"Aww, this isn't right. Listen, Bender, if we found your antenna could they still reattach it?"
669,BENDER,Maybe. If we get it on ice right away.
670,SMITTY,Bingo!
671,URL,You call that an antenna?
672,BENDER,"This time, you'll have all the human comfort. We'll get a couple of toilets, some food cookers, maybe a puppy."
673,FRY,It's good to be home.
674,BENDER,"It sure is. By the way, I saved your stuff."
675,FRY,"So that's where those skin flakes went. Hmm, do you think this fruit tree's going to get enough light?"
676,BENDER,There's a window in the closet.
677,FRY,"This is huge! Bender, why don't I just live in here?"
678,BENDER,"In a closet? Oh, humans!"
679,THE END,
680,"""LOVE'S LABOURS LOST IN SPACE""",
681,LEELA,This place was a great choice. The food is amazing. And such generous portions.
682,DOUG,You like the meal just wait until you try these after dinner mints.
683,LEELA,"You know, Doug, most guys are put off by my eye. It's nice to finally meet someone who's open-minded.  Ew!"
684,FRY,What was wrong with your date last night?
685,LEELA,I don't know. Something I couldn’t quite put my finger on. Possibly his vile lizard tongue.
686,AMY,You're too picky.
687,FRY,"Yeah. If you rule out every guy with a lizard tongue or a low I.Q. or an explosive violent temper, of course you're gonna be lonely."
688,LEELA,There's nothing wrong with having high standards. Now can we please stop --
689,ZOIDBERG,The female Leela's problem is purely medical. Soon she will drop her eggs and they will hatch and all will be well.
690,AMY,You just have to give guys a chance. Sometimes you meet a guy and think he's a pig. But then later you realise he actually has a really good body.
691,LEELA,"Thank you all for the inspiring advice, but I'm perfectly happy with my life the way it is."
692,BENDER,That sounds like a cry for help.
693,AMY,Let's all take her out tonight. There's lots of great places to meet people.
694,HERMES,The Federal Sex Bureau.
695,BENDER,A saucy puppet show.
696,ZOIDBERG,The rotting carcass of a whale.
697,AMY,"Hmm, I'll pick!"
698,AMY,"Oh, wow, it's totally retro."
699,FRY,Why's everyone wearing those rings?
700,AMY,Guh! Because nobody wears them anymore! Rings are stupid!
701,FRY,I think they look cool.
702,AMY,Shh! Don't let anyone hear you say that!
703,MAN,"Hey, did that guy just say rings are cool?"
704,AMY,"Nope, he said they're stupid."
705,MAN,Cool!
706,AMY,So what do you think of that guy by the bar?
707,LEELA,I don't know. Maybe?
708,BENDER,"Forget it, he's gay."
709,LEELA,What?! How can you tell?
710,BENDER,I just know these things. I've got what they call gaydar.
711,LEELA,There's no such thing.
712,BENDER,"No?  OK, I got a lock on him.  Yep! He's gay!"
713,AMY,Are you sure?
714,BENDER,Definitely. Unless I'm getting interference from a gay weather balloon.
715,WOMAN,You're from the 20th century? That's incredible! I'm from the 21st century.
716,FRY,No way! We've got so much in common.
717,WOMAN,We sure do. Remember when those cyborgs enslaved humanity?
718,FRY,"Uh, yeah! That rings a bell."
719,AMY,This is Bolt Rolands. Bolt is a hyper-sled racer with 10 wins on the pro circuit.
720,BOLT,"Hello, beautiful!"
721,BENDER,(whispering) I think she means 10 wins on the gay circuit.
722,BOLT,I wish! Those cats can really fly.
723,AMY,"This is M-5438, an entity of pure energy."
724,LEELA,That's great - really - but he's just not what I'm looking for.
725,M-5438,"I understand. One day you will evolve beyond your physical body, and on that day I hope you will pick up the phone."
726,AMY,You're impossible.
727,BENDER,Just as well; I think he comes from a dimension that's big on musical theatre.
728,FRY,"Psst, I need the apartment tonight. Go see a saucy puppet show."
729,BENDER,Can do!
730,JANITOR,"My, my, my! What's a beautiful lady like you --  Oh, my! Eurgh! I'm sorry, I thought you had two eyes."
731,BENDER,"So, Leela, you must have had your pick of the litter last night at closing time."
732,LEELA,Could you guys please stop talking about my personal life?
733,FARNSWORTH,"Yes, let's all talk about Leela's personal life later. But right now we have business to attend to."
734,FRY,A delivery?
735,FARNSWORTH,No. A tax-deductible mission of charity.
736,COMPUTER VOICE,This is Vergon 6.
737,FARNSWORTH,This is Vergon 6.
738,AMY,Buh!
739,FARNSWORTH,"It's a sunny little doomed planet, inhabited by a number of frisky little doomed animals."
740,LEELA,Animals?
741,FARNSWORTH,"That's right. Animals in desperate need of rescue. You see, Vergon 6 was once filled with a super dense substance known as dark matter, each pound of which weighs over ten thousand pounds."
742,LEELA,Wait! What about the animals?
743,FARNSWORTH,"Well, dark matter is extremely valuable as starship fuel. That's why it was all mined out, leaving the planet completely hollow."
744,LEELA,"Yes, but what about the animals?"
745,FARNSWORTH,The wha?
746,LEELA,The animals.
747,FARNSWORTH,"I didn't say anything about animals. Now it seems that the planet will collapse within three days. Incidentally, this will kill all the animals."
748,LEELA,So we have to bring back two of each kind. Just like Noah's Ark.
749,BENDER,Why two?  Oh!
750,FRY,I bet you Leela's holding out for a nice guy with one eye.
751,BENDER,"That'll take forever. What she oughta do is find a nice guy with two eyes, then poke one out."
752,FRY,"Yeah, that'd be a timesaver."
753,LEELA,Do you mind?
754,BENDER,Here you go.  You can use this as an eye-poker.
755,LEELA,"Thank you. But I don't care how many eyes a man has - as long as it's less than five. All I'm looking for is a guy who's adventurous, self-confident..."
756,LEELA,...maybe a snappy dresser.
757,ZAPP,"These new uniforms are pretty snappy, eh, first officer?"
758,KIF,"I suppose, captain. I'm as big a fan of velour as you are. Now what do you want to do about that unidentified ship?"
759,ZAPP,Destroy them!  Mmm! That's got a nice feel to it.
760,ZAPP,Captain's journal; star date 3000.3.
761,KIF,"Who are you talking to, sir?"
762,ZAPP,"You! Aren't you getting this?  We have detected a vessel attempting to break the security cordon around Vergon 6. I'm anticipating an all-out tactical dogfight, followed by a light dinner...ravioli, ham, sundae bar."
763,LEELA,"Hey, look! That's Zapp Brannigan's ship."
764,FRY,Wow! The Zapp Brannigan?
765,LEELA,Uh-huh!
766,FRY,Who's the Zapp Brannigan?
767,KIF,"Shall I fire on them now, sir?"
768,ZAPP,"Not yet, Kif. In the game of chess, you can never let your adversary see your pieces.  What?"
769,LEELA,They say Zapp Brannigan single-handedly saved the Octillian system from a horde of rampaging Killbots.
770,FRY,Wow!
771,BENDER,"A grim day for robot-kind. Ah, but we can always build more Killbots!"
772,LEELA,He's the most decorated captain in the whole Democratic Order Of Planets.
773,FRY,(teasing) Leela's got a boyfriend!
774,LEELA,No I don't. But I think we ought to meet with him and see if he'll help us rescue those animals.
775,BENDER,Well just in case you guys hit it off you'll wanna take this with you.
776,KIF,"Sir, they're headed straight for us."
777,ZAPP,"A well-calculated move straight out of Sun Tzu's classic text The Art Of War, or my own masterwork: Zapp Brannigan's Big Book Of War.  But the one thing their captain doesn't realise and never will is that --"
778,KIF,"Sir, they've docked with us and have come aboard."
779,ZAPP,"Then I have risked all and lost. Kif, old man, I'll be in the escape pod. If that wicker chair I like survives the slaughter, have it sent to my P.O. box."
780,LEELA,"Hello, I'm Leela, captain of the Planet Express delivery ship. We've come aboard to plead for your assistance."
781,KIF,"Well, if there's anything --"
782,ZAPP,I'm in command here. Zapp Brannigan. Has my fame preceded me or was I too quick for you?
783,LEELA,"Oh, not at all. I'm just so uh...really thrilled to meet you!"
784,ZAPP,You're an impressive piece of captain. Beautiful and deadly - a potent combination.
785,LEELA,(flattered) You don't mean that!
786,ZAPP,"But I do. I doubt I've seen more than three or four captains sexier than you, and only one who was deadlier."
787,FRY,I heard that one time you single-handedly defeated a horde of rampaging somethings in the something something system.
788,ZAPP,The Killbots? A trifle! It was simply a matter of outsmarting them.
789,FRY,Wow! I never would have thought of that!
790,ZAPP,"You see, Killbots have a preset kill limit. Knowing their weakness, I sent wave after wave of my own men at them, until they reached their limit and shutdown. Kif, show them the medal I won."
791,ZAPP,"More, please.  A little more...more...keep going."
792,LEELA,"Captain Brannigan, we really need to talk to you about our mission."
793,ZAPP,"Whatever it is, I'm willing to put wave after wave of men at your disposal. Right men?"
794,CREWMAN,(shouting) You suck!
795,LEELA,We're hoping to save the animals of Vergon 6 from extinction. And if you could just --
796,ZAPP,Vergon 6?! This light dinner is over.
797,LEELA,Wait! What's wrong?
798,ZAPP,"The Democratic Order Of Planets prohibits interfering with undeveloped worlds. It's a little rule known as ""Brannigan's Law""."
799,LEELA,But people already interfered. That planet was mined completely hollow.
800,ZAPP,"Yes, by a Democratic Order Of Planets mining crew."
801,LEELA,This doesn't make any sense.
802,ZAPP,I don't pretend to understand Brannigan's Law. I merely enforce it.
803,LEELA,Fine! We'll save the animals without your help.
804,ZAPP,I'm afraid I can't allow that. Guards!
805,FRY,What just happened?
806,BENDER,He's throwing us in prison.
807,FRY,Dang! Can I get this wrapped up?
808,LEELA,Ow! I might've liked Zapp Brannigan if he weren't a pompous dimwit who threw me in prison.
809,BENDER,You really are too picky.
810,ZAPP,"Kif, follow me up to the observation deck. I've got some musing to do."
811,KIF,"Oh, jeez!"
812,ZAPP,"I'm facing a formidable female adversary, Kif. Suggestions?"
813,KIF,I fail to see any problem sir. You already imprisoned her under directive B10.81.
814,ZAPP,You mean Brannigan's Law?
815,KIF,"Right, that law."
816,ZAPP,Which one?
817,KIF,Brannigan's Law.
818,ZAPP,"Kif, you're my best and most loyal friend but you've earned my contempt once again. As my prodégé you should know that the only way to deal with a female adversary is to seduce her.  This time we are sure she's a woman, right?"
819,KIF,Yes.
820,ZAPP,"Good! Invite her to my quarters. Oh, and have the boy lay out my formal shorts."
821,KIF,"The boy, sir?"
822,ZAPP,You. You lay out my formal shorts.
823,KIF,The jackass wants to see you in his quarters.
824,LEELA,"Good. This will be my chance to reason with him, captain to captain."
825,KIF,And he wants you to wear this.
826,ZAPP,Come and get it!
827,ZAPP,"Welcome to my humble chamber. Or as I call it, ""the Love-nasium"". Shampagin?"
828,LEELA,I didn't realise you were such a coin-a-sewer.
829,ZAPP,Well I have studied abroad. Or two!
830,LEELA,Captain...
831,ZAPP,Uh-huh?
832,LEELA,...if we could speak seriously for a moment...
833,ZAPP,Uh-huh?
834,LEELA,...I'd like you to reconsider letting us rescue those animals.
835,ZAPP,Mm-hm.  I like your style. I find it very...(whispering)...erotic.
836,LEELA,What?
837,ZAPP,(shouting) Erotic!
838,FRY,"We can definitely escape, Bender. All you have to do is bend the hatch off this steam pipe."
839,BENDER,"Hey, yeah!"
840,FRY,No good! It's full of steam!
841,ZAPP,You look like a woman who enjoys the finer things. Come over here and feel my velour bedspread.
842,LEELA,I'm not really in the mood.
843,ZAPP,"Leela, it's real velour. Just let yourself go."
844,LEELA,Can I please just go back to prison?
845,ZAPP,You'd rather sit in prison than spend one evening with the Zapper?
846,LEELA,Much rather!  What are you doing?
847,ZAPP,"(crying) Oh, God, I'm pathetic. Sorry. Just go. You want the rest of the shampagin?"
848,LEELA,"No, and it's pronounced ""sham-pane""."
849,ZAPP,"(crying) Oh, God, no!"
850,LEELA,Its not a big deal.
851,ZAPP,(crying) I get so lonely. I just thought you - a fellow captain - would understand.
852,LEELA,"Oh, forget it."
853,ZAPP,"(crying) Yeah, it's great ordering people around and stuff but through it all you're completely alone."
854,LEELA,It comes with the job.
855,ZAPP,(crying) I'm just so lonely!
856,LEELA,"Oh, come on, cheer up, it's not that bad."
857,FRY,You wanna try escaping again?
858,BENDER,"Nah, I'm comfy."
859,FRY,"Man, Leela's been gone a long time. I hope she's at least making progress with Zapp Brannigan."
860,ZAPP,"Good morning, lover."
861,LEELA,"Uh, listen, Zapp."
862,ZAPP,Now you're officially my woman. Kudos! I can't say I don't envy you.
863,LEELA,"Zapp, last night was a mistake."
864,ZAPP,A sexy mistake.
865,LEELA,"No, just a regular mistake. For a split second my common sense was overwhelmed by pity."
866,ZAPP,A split second is all it takes. That's why sooner or later you'll come crawling back to the Zapper.
867,LEELA,The only kind of crawling I'm doing to you is away - from!
868,ZAPP,"Leela, you're obviously confused and aroused."
869,LEELA,"Look, I'm going down to Vergon 6 to save those animals whether you like it or not."
870,ZAPP,Go ahead. I won't stop you.
871,LEELA,"Threaten all you -- wait, what?"
872,ZAPP,"We both know you won't make it halfway to Vergon 6 before the craving sets in. Then you'll come crawling back for another taste of sweet, sweet candy...Bam!"
873,LEELA,Eurgh!
874,ZAPP,Kif!
875,KIF,"Yes --  Yes, captain?"
876,ZAPP,I have made it with a woman. Inform the men.
877,KIF,The fatso says you're free to go.
878,FRY,Really? Why?
879,KIF,"(quietly) ""Why"" indeed."
880,FRY,What does that mean?
881,LEELA,(defensively) Nothing.
882,BENDER,So should we get our stuff and head down to the planet?
883,LEELA,"(defensively) We just talked, OK?!"
884,LEELA,Alright. We don't have much time to collect these animals. The planet is supposed to collapse in approximately two hours ago.
885,LEELA,"Hello there.  Hmm, he doesn't seem to be on the checklist."
886,BENDER,So you're saying we can cook him?
887,FRY,"Yeah, a barbecue! I'll wear my hilarious apron."
888,LEELA,"No! I don't care how hilarious your apron is, we're not cooking him.  Aww, I'll call him Nibbler."
889,BENDER,Aww! (whispering to Fry) I'll fire up the grill!
890,LEELA,I hope he'll be OK in there with all those big animals.
891,ZAPP,"Y'know, Kif, once my woman returns I won't have much time to hang out with the boys anymore."
892,KIF,"That's a shame, sir."
893,ZAPP,"So let's make the most of our time together, shall we?  Never mind. Just give me a back rub."
894,BENDER,I found a pair of Hermaphlamingoes.
895,LEELA,Good. That's the last species.
896,BENDER,Hey. What the?
897,FRY,Where'd they all go?
898,LEELA,Nibbler!
899,FRY,I can't believe we flew halfway across the galaxy and enjoyed a steam just to get lunch for that stupid animal!
900,BENDER,He's pending for a bending.
901,LEELA,"Leave him alone. It's not his fault that he's an unstoppable killing machine. Is it, snoogums?"
902,FRY,The planet's kerploding!
903,LEELA,"Prepare for lift-off.  We're out of fuel. Bender, I told you to fill the tank before we left."
904,BENDER,"Yeah, I'll do it when we get back."
905,FRY,"Man, lucky for us Zapp Brannigan's nearby."
906,LEELA,"No way, forget it! I refuse to go crawling back to him!"
907,FRY,What? What are you talking about?
908,LEELA,(defensively) Nothing. We just talked.
909,BENDER,"So what's your problem? It's not like you slept with him.  Oh, my God!"
910,FRY,"How could you, Leela? I thought you had some standards. I mean, jeez, he's a dumb, gross gorilla!"
911,LEELA,That's enough. Don't you think I feel bad enough already?
912,FRY,No!
913,LEELA,"Alright, alright I'll call him.  I mean if living is that important to you."
914,ZAPP,"And that's why you'll never make captain, Kif.  Hmmm."
915,LEELA,"Hello, Zapp?"
916,ZAPP,"Well, well, well!"
917,LEELA,"Zapp, we're out of fuel..."
918,LEELA,...and Vergon 6 is about to implode. We need your help.
919,ZAPP,"So, crawling back to the Big Z like a bird on its belly. Delicious."
920,LEELA,Bird's don't crawl.
921,ZAPP,They've been known to.
922,LEELA,"Look, are you going to rescue us or not?"
923,ZAPP,Can't you ask a little more...sexfully?
924,LEELA,(sexfully) Please...
925,LEELA,...Big Z?
926,ZAPP,"Certainly. But first you'll have to get rid of that thing.  That's the law, Leela. And Brannigan's Law is like Brannigan's love: hard and fast!..."
927,ZAPP,...Now put that greasy rat outside and we'll tow you to safety.
928,LEELA,"I would never abandon a helpless animal. Y'know, Zapp, once I thought you were a big pompous buffoon. Then I realised that inside you were just a pitiful child. But now I realise that outside that child is a big pompous buffoon!"
929,ZAPP,And which one rocked your world?
930,FRY,"Wow, way to tell that guy off. Now what's your secret escape plan?"
931,LEELA,"Uh, I guess to sit here and wait for death."
932,BENDER,Can do!
933,BENDER,What the hell was that?
934,FRY,Pew!
935,LEELA,I don't believe it! It's dark matter.
936,BENDER,So this guy just unloaded a steaming pile of starship fuel?
937,LEELA,"His species must've filled the entire planet with it. Did you do that, you cute little --  Come on. That should be more than enough fuel to get us outta here. Bender, pick it up and put it in the engine."
938,LEELA,We made it!  And some of the animals survived.
939,BENDER,So a couple of animals didn't die and Leela got lucky. That's what I call a successful mission!
940,FRY,We're heroes!
941,LEELA,(thinking) Dear Captain's Diary. I may not have found love on this mission but I did find a cute little companion who excretes starship fuel. And that's just as good.
942,ZAPP,Captain's journal; star date...uh...
943,KIF,April 13th.
944,ZAPP,April 13th...point two.
945,ZAPP,"We have failed to uphold Brannigan's Law. However, I did make it with a hot alien babe. And in the end is that not what man has dreamt of since first he looked up at the stars? Kif, I'm asking you a question!"
946,THE END,
947,"""FEAR OF A BOT PLANET""",
948,LEELA,"What do you think of the view, Fry?"
949,FRY,"It really puts things in perspective. I mean, from up here an entire world can seem utterly insignificant."
950,BENDER,"Hey, nice seats! We're close enough to when you knock a player down with a beer bottle, he stays down."
951,FRY,I don't get this. Is blernsball exactly the same as baseball?
952,FARNSWORTH,Baseball? God forbid!
953,LEELA,"Face it, Fry. Baseball was as boring as mom and apple pie. That's why they jazzed it up."
954,FRY,"Boring? Baseball wasn't -- hmm, so they finally jazzed it up?"
955,FRY,Home run! Ha ha! Yay! Right?
956,UMPIRE,Out!
957,FRY,What just happened? Why is the ball on that springy thing?
958,LEELA,It's traditional. Just like aluminium bats and the seventh inning grope.
959,BENDER,"I got me a souvenir!  Aww, here you go, kid!"
960,ZOIDBERG,"I'd like a jumbo squid log, please."
961,VENDOR,We don't sell those.
962,ZOIDBERG,"Alright, alright. Let me have one of your young on a roll."
963,VENDOR,We're outta rolls.
964,ZOIDBERG,Fine! Just give me something crawling with parasites.
965,FRY,"Mmm, at least hotdogs haven't changed."
966,BENDER,"Hey, buddies, who wants popcorn?"
967,FRY,Me!
968,FARNSWORTH,"Oh, yes!"
969,ZOIDBERG,"Yes, please, popcorn!"
970,BENDER,Anyone want butter on that?
971,FRY,"Hey, I'm starting to get the hang of this game. The blerns are loaded, the count's three blerns and two anti-blerns and the infield blern rule is in effect, right?"
972,LEELA,"Except for the word ""blern"" that was complete gibberish."
973,MAN,Multi-ball!  Multi-ball!  Blern! Blerrrn!
974,LEELA,Alright! Yes! Miller's on a pace to hit 70 blerns!
975,FARNSWORTH,"He's good, alright. But he's no Clem Johnson. And Johnson played back in the days before steroid injections were mandatory."
976,BENDER,"Clem Johnson? That skin bag wouldn't have lasted one pitch in the old Robot Leagues! Now Wireless Joe Jackson, there was a blern hitting machine!"
977,LEELA,"Exactly! He was a machine designed to hit blerns! I mean, come on, Wireless Joe was nothing but a programmable bat on wheels."
978,BENDER,"Oh, and I suppose Pitchomat 5000 was just a modified howitzer?"
979,LEELA,Yep.
980,BENDER,You humans are so scared of a little robot competition you won't even let us on the field.
981,FRY,What are you talking about? There's all kinds of robots down there.
982,BENDER,"Yeah, doing crap work! They're bat boys, ball polishers, sprinkler systems. But how many robot managers are there?"
983,FRY,11?
984,BENDER,Zero!  And what a surprise! Look who's scraping up the filth. Is it a human child? I wish!
985,FARNSWORTH,"Oh, dear Lord!"
986,FRY,What's wrong?
987,FARNSWORTH,It's...my...new pager.
988,HOLO-HERMES,"This is Hermes. A package just came in. Everyone is to return to the office immediately.  Get away, you filthy bird! Shoo! Shoo! Professor, turn me off, quick!"
989,FARNSWORTH,"I'm sorry, wha?"
990,HOLO-HERMES,(shouting) See you at the office!
991,BENDER,Admit it: You all think robots are just machines built by humans to make their lives easier.
992,FRY,"Well, aren't they?"
993,BENDER,I've never made anyone's life easier and you know it!
994,FARNSWORTH,"Great news, everyone. You'll be delivering a package to Chapek 9, a world where humans are killed on sight."
995,FRY,Why is that great news?
996,FARNSWORTH,"I'm glad you asked that question, Fry. You see, Chapek 9 was colonised centuries ago by a murderous crew of radical robot separatists."
997,BENDER,"Oh, so just 'cause a robot wants to kill humans that makes him a ""radical""?"
998,LEELA,"Hey, hold on. I understand these robots hate humans, but how do they feel about humanoid aliens?"
999,FARNSWORTH,They're not fans.
1000,HERMES,That's why Bender will have to make the actual delivery.
1001,BENDER,"Oh, I get it, make the robot do all the work!"
1002,LEELA,This is the first actual work you've ever had to do around here.
1003,BENDER,Well I'm not doing it! It's a robot holiday.
1004,FRY,Really? Which one?
1005,BENDER,Only Robanukah. The holiest two weeks on the robot calendar.
1006,LEELA,"Oh, come on, Bender. Last month it was Robomadom and before that Robonza."
1007,FRY,"Man, that one was a blast!"
1008,BENDER,It wasn't just a blast. It was a sacred tribute to my ancestral prototypes which happened to take the form of a drinking contest.
1009,HERMES,"Now, look here, Bender. I respect your diversity to the extent the law requires but you used up all your days off when you had that bout with Roberculosis."
1010,BENDER,"Alright, I'll go. But so help me, I'll hold a grudge against every last stinking one of you for the rest of your lives."
1011,FARNSWORTH,"Well then it's settled. So long, everyone!"
1012,FRY,So let me get this straight: This planet is completely uninhabited?
1013,BENDER,No. It's inhabited by robots!
1014,FRY,Oh. Kinda like how a warehouse is inhabited by boxes.
1015,LEELA,"OK, Bender, we're here. It's time to get to work."
1016,BENDER,"Yes, Miss Leela. Tote that space barge, lift that space pale."
1017,LEELA,"Now we can't land on the surface because those robots will kill Fry and me. So we'll have to stay up here and lower you with the winch. And remember: You don't know humans, you don't work for humans, and, above all, you don't like humans."
1018,BENDER,(ironic) I'll try to keep that in mind!
1019,LEELA,"Hmm, he seems pretty angry."
1020,FRY,"Yeah, but I guess I'd be kinda angry too if I had to go to some uninhabited planet."
1021,LEELA,Maybe we ought to do something nice for him.
1022,LEELA,There! This oughta show that stupid robot we care about him.
1023,FRY,"Ah, Bender must be done with the delivery."
1024,BENDER,"I'm in trouble. They found out I work with humans and -- oh, no! Oh, no!"
1025,FRY,"Oh, my God! We have to go down and rescue him."
1026,LEELA,"No, we can't! They'll kill us on sight."
1027,FRY,W-what are we gonna do?
1028,LEELA,I don't know! I don't know! It's not an easy decision. If only I had two or three minutes to think about it.
1029,LEELA,"OK. If we're going to save Bender, we've got to look and act exactly like robots."
1030,FRY,"(mechanical voice) I am fully operational, captain."
1031,LEELA,"We'll have to walk like robots, talk like robots and, if necessary, solve complex differential equations like robots."
1032,FRY,I can sorta dance like a robot. Will that help?
1033,LEELA,"Fry, first of all this is serious. And second of all:"
1034,FRY,"Man, we look stupid. We should've gotten store-bought costumes."
1035,LEELA,"Yeah, but there wasn't a Woolworth's in this quadrant."
1036,GUARDBOT #1,Halt!
1037,GUARDBOT #2,Be you robot or human?
1038,LEELA,Robot...we be.
1039,FRY,"Uh, yup! Just two robots out roboting it up!  Eh?"
1040,GUARDBOT #1,Administer the test.
1041,GUARDBOT #2,"Which of the following would you most prefer? A: A puppy, B: A pretty flower from your sweetie, or C: A large properly-formatted data file?"
1042,GUARDBOT #1,Choose!
1043,FRY,(whispering) C!  (talking) Is the puppy mechanical in any way?
1044,GUARDBOT #2,No. It is the bad kind of puppy.
1045,LEELA,Then we'll go with that data file.
1046,GUARDBOT #2,Correct.
1047,GUARDBOT #1,The flower would also have been acceptable.
1048,GUARDBOT #2,You may pass.
1049,LEELA,"Now if you see any robots, just stay out of their way.  (shouting) So far, so good."
1050,CONSTRUCTIONBOT,"Little to the right, there you go."
1051,LEELA,Have you seen this robot?
1052,CONSTRUCTIONBOT,"Sorry, can't help you.  Hey, watch it! Don't drop that there!  Oh!"
1053,LEELA,"Come on, Fry, walk like a robot."
1054,FRY,I can't. I have to go to the bathroom.
1055,LEELA,Robots don't have bathrooms.
1056,FRY,"Oh, right. I wonder where they smoke in high school."
1057,LEELA,Listen. Just go behind those garbage cans. I'll stand guard.
1058,LEELA,"Hurry up, Fry!"
1059,ROBOT,Sir? Are you aware that you're leaking coolant at an alarming rate?
1060,FRY,Uh...
1061,ROBOT,Lemme just patch you up with some hot resin.
1062,FRY,"I think the leak's stopping itself. Wait. Wait. Yeah, there we go. Wait. Yeah!"
1063,ROBOT,What sort of robot turns down a free blast of searing-hot resin?
1064,LEELA,I'm sorry. My friend and I have to go and perform some mindless repetitive tasks.
1065,ROBOT,Sounds like a romantic evening. I won't keep you.
1066,PATROL OFFICER #1,Get the humanoid.
1067,PATROL OFFICER #2,Get the intruder.
1068,ANNOUNCER,Intruder alert! Intruder alert!
1069,LEELA,Quick! Let's duck in here!
1070,ANNOUNCER,We interrupt this sound file to bring you a terrifying announcement: A non-metallic being has been sighted in the vicinity of Make Out Point.
1071,RUSTY,"Say, Wendy. Your chassis is a little scuffed. Mind if I polish it for you?"
1072,WENDY,"Did you here that, Rusty? It sounded like a human."
1073,RUSTY,"Relax, Wendy. Humans will never come to our defenceless little town. Its perfectly safe to let our guard down -- even for a second."
1074,HUMAN,I will eat and digest you all with my system of mighty organs. Behold!
1075,FRY,"Wow, the 3-D's great!"
1076,LEELA,Mine's not working.
1077,ARMY ROBOT,"Funny, isn't it? The human was impervious to our most powerful magnetic fields, yet in the end he succumbed to a harmless sharpened stick!"
1078,WENDY,I'm just glad the nightmare is over.
1079,ARMY ROBOT,"It'll never be over, Wendy. Even now humans are lurking in our playgrounds, our breezeways, perhaps even...our movie theatres!"
1080,FRY,God help us!
1081,LEELA,OK. Keep an eye out for Bender.
1082,ROBOT #1,"So, what did you think of the movie?"
1083,FRY,"Umm, too much romance, not enough human killing."
1084,ROBOT #2,"Yeah, it was a real chick flick."
1085,LEELA,What's that?
1086,ROBOT #1,"What do you mean ""What's that?""? It's 5 o'clock: Time for the daily human hunt."
1087,LEELA,Try to stay with the crowd so no one notices how crummy you look.
1088,ROBOT #3,"Aww, that was uncalled for!"
1089,FRY,I'm over here.
1090,ROBOT #4,I heard a human was draining coolant behind garbage can 738.
1091,ROBOT #5,I heard they unscrew our lug nuts at night and eat them at their human brunches.
1092,ROBOT MAYOR,"Welcome to a very special human hunt. We have with us today a guest who's irrational hatred for humans makes me look like a human sympathiser!  A newly-arrived refugee from Earth, lets hear it for...Bender!"
1093,FRY,It's him! He's OK!
1094,BENDER,Death to humans!
1095,FRY,Ahh! It's good to hear his voice!
1096,BENDER,"Many said I was too extreme when I first called for the annihilation of the human species, as well as some of the more cunning monkeys. But after living on Earth I can tell you that I am, if anything, too merciful!"
1097,FRY,My God! He's become evil.  I mean eviler!
1098,BENDER,"Thank you! Thank you! And if you enjoyed that diatribe then you'll want to purchase my spoken word album, just 18.95! Act now and you'll get this Bender action figurine."
1099,BENDER FIGURINE,Bite my shiny metal ass!
1100,ROBOT #6,"(shouting) Oh, I want one!"
1101,ROBOT MAYOR,Let the hunt begin!
1102,BENDER,"Now, your basic human is between three- and 25-feet tall and is made of a hairy, oily goo wrapped in a t-shirt."
1103,ROBOT #1,"Is it true they bite your neck, suck your transmission fluid and then you become a human?"
1104,BENDER,"Sure, why not?"
1105,ROBOT MAYOR,Anything in the trap?
1106,BENDER,Nothing. Today's active humans prefer a low-calorie bait.
1107,ROBOT MAYOR,"Well that makes 146,000 unsuccessful hunts in a row. But I've got a good feeling about tomorrow."
1108,BENDER,Wait! What's that?
1109,ROBOT MAYOR,That's the old abandoned adult book store. Nothing in there except a few mouldy old shreds of robot pornography.
1110,BENDER,"Hmm, sounds like a breeding ground for humans. I'd better check it out."
1111,BENDER,"Oh, yeah! You're a bad girl, aren't you?"
1112,FRY,Psst! Bender!
1113,BENDER,Huh? Wha? You! What the hell are you doing here?
1114,FRY,We've been looking for you. Last we heard you were under arrest as a human sympathiser.
1115,BENDER,I was. But they let me go when I told them I killed a million billion humans.
1116,LEELA,Good for you. Now let's all get back to the ship.
1117,BENDER,What for?
1118,FRY,We're rescuing you.
1119,BENDER,I don't wanna be rescued.
1120,FRY,Say what?
1121,BENDER,"I love this planet. I've got wealth, fame and access to the depths of sleaze that those things bring."
1122,FRY,"But, Bender, we're your friends."
1123,BENDER,Friends? That activates my hilarity unit! I'm just a machine to you. You're no more friends with me than you are with the toaster or the phonograph or the electric chair.
1124,FRY,That's not true.
1125,BENDER,Well that's how it feels to me.
1126,FRY,"Bye, Bender. I'll miss you."
1127,BENDER,"Go on, get out of here before you get caught."
1128,ROBOT MAYOR,"Bender, good news: Your album just went gold! What the?"
1129,ROBOT #1,It's the humans!
1130,ROBOT MAYOR,Bender! Do something!
1131,BENDER,Uh...got you...you murderous flesh piles!
1132,ROBOT MAYOR,"Your Honour, I intend to demonstrate beyond 0.5% of a doubt that these humans before us are guilty of the crime of being humans. Come to think of it, I rest my case!"
1133,JUDGE,"Thank you, prosecutor. I will now consider the evidence."
1134,FRY,"Hey, wait a minute! Isn't anyone going to defend us?"
1135,LEELA,Yeah! I mean he might not have a case but I'm genuinely not a human.
1136,ROBOT MAYOR,"Quiet, human!"
1137,ROBOT BAILIFF,Uh-oh! He froze up again!
1138,ROBOT MAYOR,Try control alt delete.
1139,ROBOT #1,Jiggle the cord.
1140,ROBOT #2,Turn him off and on.
1141,ROBOT #3,Clean the gunk out of the mouse.
1142,FRY,Call technical support.
1143,ROBOT BAILIFF,"OK, OK, he's back online."
1144,JUDGE,I find the defendants - guilty!
1145,FRY,No!
1146,LEELA,Look! One eye! Count them: One! Not human!
1147,JUDGE,"The humans are hereby sentenced to live as robots live on Earth. They will perform tedious calculations and spot-weld automobiles, until they become obsolete and are given away to an inner-city middle school."
1148,ROBOT MAYOR,"Great work, Bender! You've taught us to hate humans all over again!"
1149,LEELA,Are you alright?
1150,FRY,"Oh, yeah."
1151,LEELA,Who are you?
1152,BLUE ELDER,We are the robot elders.
1153,FRY,You don't look very old.
1154,BLUE ELDER,Thanks. We try to take care of ourselves.
1155,LEELA,What's going on here?
1156,RED ELDER,Silence! Bring in Bender.
1157,BENDER,"Alright, let's make this quick, I'm due at the opening of a mini-mall. Hey! What is this?"
1158,BLUE ELDER,Silence! It is time to put the humans to death.
1159,FRY,But the judge already sentenced us at the trial!
1160,RED ELDER,"Silence! That was just a show for the public. We are the true rulers of this planet, hand carved from meteorites by the Robot Founders over four centuries ago."
1161,BLUE ELDER,Silence! Come forward Bender. You will have the honour of executing the prisoners.
1162,GREEN ELDER,Silence! I concur!
1163,YELLOW ELDER,Here: Use the ceremonial killer-ma-jig.
1164,BENDER,"Uh, I'm a little tired right now. Would it be alright if I just gave 'em a savage beating?"
1165,BLUE ELDER,No! The Elders have spoken. Show us the killing skills than have made you a media darling.
1166,GREEN ELDER,Do it now! Kill them before they bring down our whole society!
1167,ELDERS,(chanting) Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it!
1168,BENDER,"Aww!  I can't kill them. Plenty of humans have mistreated robots but not these two. They're my friends. Humans are no threat to us. They're stupid, putrid cowards."
1169,FRY,Damn right!
1170,BENDER,"The fact is, humans are completely harmless."
1171,BLUE ELDER,We're well aware of that.
1172,BENDER,You are?
1173,BLUE ELDER,Of course. But they're useful to us as a scapegoat to distract the public from their real problem.
1174,GREEN ELDER,Like our crippling lug nut shortage.
1175,ORANGE ELDER,And a corrupt government of incompetent Robot Elders.
1176,YELLOW ELDER,"Duh, that's for sure."
1177,BLUE ELDER,"Quiet, Jimmy."
1178,BENDER,"Well, I'm glad we got all that out in the open. We'll just let ourselves out."
1179,GREEN ELDER,Silence! You all know too much.
1180,BLUE ELDER,"Elders: Execute function, control, shift, kill!"
1181,FRY,Stop! Take one more step and I'll breathe fire on you!
1182,LEELA,He'll do it. He's crazy!
1183,YELLOW ELDER,Can they really breathe fire or did we make that up?
1184,BLUE ELDER,"Gee, I can't remember anymore! It might just be from that stupid movie."
1185,ORANGE ELDER,Was that the original or the re-make?
1186,BLUE ELDER,I don't -- hey! They're getting away.
1187,FRY,"So long, suckers!  Uh, hello, suckers!"
1188,BENDER,"Hey, hold on a second, I forgot to deliver the package."
1189,ROBOT #7,Lug nuts! Precious lug nuts!
1190,ROBOT #8,Hooray for the humans!
1191,BENDER,"Wow, I can't believe you guys did all this for me! This is the best Robanukah ever!"
1192,FRY,We wanted to show you that we really do respect your robot heritage.
1193,BENDER,"Aww, thanks! You do know that I made Robanukah up to get out of work, right?"
1194,LEELA,Of course.
1195,FRY,But that doesn't make it any less meaningful.
1196,BENDER,"In that case, let the dancing begin! Hey, you guys are good. How the hell do you do that?"
1197,THE END,
1198,"""A FISHFUL OF DOLLARS""",
1199,FRY,"I can't take it anymore! They've been at it for hours!  (shouting) Give it a rest, you two!"
1200,ROBOT,(shouting) Sorry!
1201,TEACHER,"Good morning, class. I trust you've all prepared for today's final exam."
1202,FRY,"Uh, excuse me? I missed a few lectures. Uh, what subject is this?"
1203,TEACHER,Ancient Egyptian algebra.
1204,FRY,What a nightmare!
1205,TEACHER,"Mister Fry, are those your underpants? Young man, I think it's time you learned a lesson about Lightspeed brand briefs."
1206,ANNOUNCER,(voice-over) Lightspeed fits today's active lifestyle. Whether you're on the job......or having fun... Lightspeed briefs. Style and comfort for the discriminating crotch.
1207,FRY,What a weird dream! I'll never get back to sleep.
1208,FRY,So you're telling me they broadcast commercials into people's dreams?
1209,LEELA,Of course.
1210,FRY,"But, how is that possible?"
1211,FARNSWORTH,"It's very simple. The ad gets into your brain just like this liquid gets into this egg.  Although in reality it's not liquid, but gamma radiation."
1212,FRY,That's awful. It's like brainwashing.
1213,LEELA,Didn't you have ads in the 20th century?
1214,FRY,"Well, sure, but not in our dreams. Only on TV and radio. And in magazines and movies and at ball games and on buses and milk cartons and t-shirts and written in the sky. But not in dreams. No siree!"
1215,BENDER,"Quit squawking, flesh wad, nobody's forcing you to buy anything."
1216,AMY,"Yeah. I mean we all have commercials in our dreams but you don't see us running off to buy brand name merchandise at low, low prices."
1217,SALESWOMAN,Hi! Care to sample the latest fragrance from Calvin Clone?
1218,AMY,No thanks.
1219,SALESWOMAN,"And you, sir?"
1220,BENDER,No thanks I --
1221,COSMETOLOGIST,What a lovely face. We just need to draw attention away from the eye area.
1222,FRY,Cool.  Can I try these on before I buy them?
1223,SALESMAN,I'm afraid I can't let you open the package. But you can try on the demo pair.
1224,FRY,: Ooh! Ho ho ho!
1225,AMY,"Hey, Bender! Great new sweater."
1226,BENDER,New? What sweater? I came in with it. I don't know you people!
1227,SALESMAN,"$30, please."
1228,FRY,$30? I can't afford that. Unless... Do you take Visa?
1229,SALESMAN,Visa hasn't existed for 500 years.
1230,FRY,American Express?
1231,SALESMAN,600 years.
1232,FRY,Discover card?
1233,SALESMAN,Sorry we don't take Discover.
1234,AMY,Hey! You're springing for Lightspeed? Pretty ritzy!
1235,FRY,"No, I can't afford them. Being poor sucks. What kind of world is this where they advertise things not everybody can afford?"
1236,AMY,Quiet. There's an ad coming on.
1237,MOM,"Hello shoppers. It's me, Mom!"
1238,FRY,Hey who's the rocker jockey?
1239,AMY,Guh! It's Mom. The world's most huggable industrialist.
1240,MOM,"Call me old fashioned, but when my robot starts to squeak like an old screen door well, that's when I reach for a can of Mom's Old Fashioned Robot Oil."
1241,BENDER,"Mmm, tasty!"
1242,MOM,And remember: Mom's oil is made with 10% more love than the next leading brand!
1243,ANNOUNCER,"""Mom"", ""love"" and ""screen door"" are registered trademarks of Mom Corp."
1244,FRY,"Hey, Bender. Sounds like you could use a little of that oil."
1245,BENDER,I'm boned.
1246,SMITTY,Freeze scuzzbot!
1247,BENDER,"Uh, there's obviously been some sort of a mistake here.  I'm sure there's......I say I'm sure there's......that is, I'm sure there's...a very...reasonable..."
1248,AMY,Do we have enough money to pay Bender's fine?
1249,FRY,"78, 79. 79.50. Crud! We're 50 cents short."
1250,LEELA,"I'd love to chip in, but Bender stole my wallet."
1251,FRY,"Hey, that's my old bank. Maybe my account's still open."
1252,TELLER,"Hmm. We don't seem to have your retina scan, your fingerprint or your colonic map on file."
1253,FRY,"Yeah, well, I did open the account over a thousand years ago. What about my ATM card?"
1254,TELLER,Do you still remember your PIN number?
1255,FRY,"Sure! It's the price of a cheese pizza and a large soda back where I used to work, Panucci's Pizza."
1256,TELLER,"OK, you had a balance of 93 cents..."
1257,FRY,Alright!
1258,TELLER,"...and at an average of 2 and a quarter percent over a period of 1000 years, that comes to...$4.3 billion."
1259,HERMES,To Fry.
1260,AMY,Cheers!
1261,LEELA,"I know Fry's rich, but do we really have to wear these top hats?"
1262,BENDER,"Maybe you don't understand just how rich he is. In fact, I think I'd better put on a monocle."
1263,FRY,Pizza dinner on me!  Just keep the tab under $50 million.
1264,ROBOT CHEF,Yo!  I haven't got all day. What kind of pizza yous guys want?
1265,FRY,"Uh, yeah. We'll have one with everything but anchovies and one with my all time favourite topping, anchovies!"
1266,ROBOT CHEF,"(mechanical voice) Invalid selection. (normal voice) Yo, what are you talking about?"
1267,FRY,Anchovies? You know? Those little headless fish?
1268,ROBOT CHEF,(mechanical voice) Does not compute. Does not compute.
1269,FARNSWORTH,"I'm sorry, Fry, but the anchovy has been extinct since the 2200's."
1270,FRY,What?!
1271,FARNSWORTH,"Oh, my, yes. Fished to death. Just about the time your people arrived on Earth wasn't it, Zoidberg?"
1272,ZOIDBERG,(defensively) I'm not on trial here.
1273,FRY,"So none of you has ever had anchovies? Oh, man! You don't know what you're missing. They were all salty and oily and they melted in your mouth and --"
1274,ZOIDBERG,"Stop! Stop! I admit it! My people ate them all! We kept saying ""One more can't hurt"" and then they were gone. We're sorry!"
1275,FRY,I just wished I could've showed you guys how great they were. I may be rich but I still can't buy back all the things I miss from the 20th century.
1276,BENDER,Maybe you're forgetting just how rich you are.  Huh? Huh?
1277,FRY,So? What do you think?
1278,LEELA,"I know you spent a lot of money on this place, Fry, but it's awfully primitive. The floors are made of such hard wood."
1279,BENDER,Hey! Get a load of this pathetic 20th century TV!
1280,FRY,What's wrong with it?
1281,BENDER,"Well, aside from causing eye cancer, these things had a lousy low-definition picture."
1282,AMY,That's true. On a TV like this I bet you couldn't even make out my obscene tattoo.
1283,LEELA,That's cute!
1284,AUCTIONEER,Sold!
1285,FRY,Yes!
1286,LEELA,"I just don't get it. Who was this Ted Danson? And why would you pay $10,000 for his skeleton?"
1287,FRY,I have an idea for a sitcom.
1288,BENDER,"Ah, leave him alone, Leela. So he's going a little wacko with his money. It's OK."
1289,LEELA,You're just saying that because he bought you that antique robot toy.
1290,BENDER,"Yeah, it is cute."
1291,AUCTIONEER,"Now, our final item: This unopened can of Angry Norwegian brand anchovies circa 1997."
1292,FRY,Anchovies?!
1293,AUCTIONEER,"The last known can in existence guaranteed fresh and edible. Do I hear $10,000?"
1294,FRY,"15,000!"
1295,MAN,20!
1296,DECAPODIAN WOMAN,"30! No, 40!"
1297,FRY,"50,000!"
1298,LEELA,Are you crazy? It's a can of old fish.
1299,FRY,Don't tell me how to spend my money.
1300,AUCTIONEER,"50 going once, twice..."
1301,MOM,"75,000."
1302,LEELA,"Oh, my God, it's Mom! I've never seen her in person before."
1303,FRY,"100,000."
1304,LEELA,"Fry, you can't bid against Mom. She's the richest, most powerful person in the world. And she's so adorable."
1305,MOM,"Well, I suppose I could go as high as...300,000."
1306,FRY,500!
1307,MOM,"Oh, mercy be. A million."
1308,FRY,Two.
1309,MOM,Six.
1310,FRY,14!
1311,MOM,"I can see the nice young man really wants those little fish. Nevertheless, I'll bid 23 million."
1312,FRY,One jillion dollars.
1313,AUCTIONEER,"Sir, that's not a number."
1314,FRY,"Oh. In that case, 50 million."
1315,MOM,"Well, boys, your old mother knows when she's been beat.  You win, young man. I tip my bonnet to you."
1316,BIDDER #1,Isn't she adorable?
1317,BIDDER #2,Isn't she sweet?
1318,AUCTIONEER,What a class act! Sold! To the gentleman who bought every item in today's auction.
1319,FRY,Now for some good old 20th century TV.
1320,ANNOUNCER,Do you remember a time when chocolate chip cookies came fresh from the oven? Petridge Farm remembers.
1321,FRY,"Ah, those were the days."
1322,ANNOUNCER,Do you remember a time when women couldn't vote and certain folk weren't allowed on golf courses? Petridge Farm remembers.
1323,LEELA,Fry? Are you there?
1324,FRY,Eh?
1325,LEELA,You haven't been to work in three days. What have you been doing?
1326,FRY,I've been sitting right here. I picked up my life exactly where I left off a thousand years ago. Now if you'll excuse me it's 8 o'clock. Time to get biz-ay!
1327,LEELA,You can't just sit here in the dark listening to classical music.
1328,FRY,I could if you hadn't turned on the lights and shut off the stereo.
1329,LEELA,"Fry, this isn't healthy. You're living in the past."
1330,FRY,I'm rich! I can live whenever I want.
1331,LEELA,But we're your friends and we live here in the year 3000.
1332,BENDER,Yeah. Now are you gonna come to the squid fights with us or sit here wallowing in your prehistoric junk?
1333,FRY,"Junk? Maybe you can't understand this but I've finally found what I need to be happy, and it's not friends: It's things."
1334,BENDER (SADLY),I'm a thing.
1335,FRY,Just leave me alone.
1336,LEELA,Fry please.   My ponytail's caught in the door.
1337,FRY,"I don't need them. Not when I have my antique videos, my bucket of fossilised KFC and 50 million dollars worth of anchovies."
1338,MOM,"Mercy me, what a day."
1339,MOM,"Could you shut the door, Igner dear? I think I feel a draught coming on. Holy crap, that bastard's itchy!  Walt! Cream soda!"
1340,WALT,"Right away, mother.  Larry, get your mother a cream soda."
1341,LARRY,But Mom said --
1342,WALT,You heard me.
1343,IGNER,"What's wrong, Mommy?"
1344,MOM,"It's those damned anchovies. That dirtbag, Fry, must know their secret. And I won't rest until I get my hands on them. No one messes with Mom!"
1345,WALT,"Quiet, you!"
1346,MOM,"As you boys know, one of the cornerstones of my empire is Mom's Old Fashioned Robot Oil. Think of it: 10 billion robots. Each one needing an oil change every 3000 miles. You don't have to do the math to know that's a buttload of oil."
1347,IGNER,Can I wear your fat suit?
1348,MOM,"(shouting): No, Igner, put that down."
1349,IGNER,Aww.
1350,WALT,What does this have to do with the anchovies?
1351,MOM,I'm getting to the freaking anchovies. A single drop of the anchovies natural oil would lubricate 10 robots permanently.
1352,LARRY,"Wow, it's a shame they went extinct."
1353,MOM (SHOUTING),"No it isn't, shut your filthy trap! (talking) Thank you, Walt. If anyone ever got a hold of anchovy DNA, they could chop out the oil-making gene, stick it in a bunch of third world kids and bam! Cheap effective robot oil. Enough to put dear old Mom out of businness."
1354,WALT,My God! This Mr. Fry must be a mastermind of the highest order.
1355,FRED,"Esther, you ugly!"
1356,MOM,"We have only one option: We'll have to bankrupt Mr Fry, so he'll be forced to sell the anchovies to us."
1357,WALT,"Mother, you are one clever old skag!"
1358,MOM,And don't you forget it!
1359,LARRY,But how are we supposed to get Fry's money out of the bank?
1360,MOM,"That part will be easy, thanks to the nice people at Mom's Old Fashioned Video Surveillance Unit."
1361,TELLER [ON TV],Do you still remember your PIN number?
1362,FRY [ON TV],"Sure! It's the price of a cheese pizza and a large soda back where I used to work, Panucci's Pizza.  It's the price of a cheese pizza and a large soda --"
1363,MOM,You know what needs to be done.
1364,LARRY,What?
1365,MOM (SHOUTING),"Get his PIN number, you idiots!  (talking) Now I'm off to some chairty BS for knocked-up teenage sluts."
1366,WALT [FROM OUTSIDE],Mr. Fry. It's those three plumbers you called for.
1367,LARRY [FROM OUTSIDE],We're here to tighten your drains.
1368,FRY,I didn't order any --
1369,WALT,Quick! Give him the tranquilliser.
1370,LARRY,That's a good boy.
1371,WALT,"Wake up, Mr. Fry."
1372,FRY,Where am I?
1373,WALT,"You're in the good old year 2000, working here at Panucci's Pizza. You fell asleep on the job."
1374,FRY,"That sounds like me but, I thought I got frozen. Wasn't I in the future?"
1375,WALT,"No, you only ""dreamed"" you were in the year 3000."
1376,FRY,"So I'm really back? That's exactly what I wanted, I guess. Who are you?"
1377,WALT,I'm Mr. Panucci.
1378,FRY,You are? Did you grow a moustache since last night?
1379,WALT,"No. Now go work the currency register. I think I hear a customer coming...I said ""I think I hear a customer coming""!"
1380,ANDERSON,"Hurry up, please. I wanna get back to the head museum."
1381,LARRY,"Don't worry, Miss Anderson, this won't take long. Now, your motivation is you're back in the year 2000 and your head's still on your body, and you want a cheese pizza."
1382,ANDERSON,"OK, but I'm only doing this so people will take my head seriously as an actress."
1383,FRY,"Hey, look! Anchovies!"
1384,WALT,"Of course. They're not extinct yet. And if you need further proof that this is really a thousand years ago well, here's contemporary actress, Pamela Anderson!"
1385,FRY,Ooh!
1386,ANDERSON,"Hello, Fry. Remember me from Baywatch: The Movie?"
1387,FRY,Uh...
1388,ANDERSON,It was the first movie to be shot entirely in slow motion.
1389,WALT (WHISPERING),It hasn't been made yet.
1390,WALT,Nope.
1391,ANDERSON,Crap!
1392,FRY,Wait. You're Pamela Anderson! Cool! What can I get you?
1393,ANDERSON,"Oh, I'll have a cheese pizza and a large...uh...line?"
1394,LARRY (WHISPERING),Soda!
1395,ANDERSON,"Oh, right! Cheese pizza and a large soda!"
1396,FRY,"Uh, cheese and a --  That was quick!"
1397,ANDERSON,So. What do I owe you?
1398,FRY,10.77. Same as my PIN number.
1399,IGNER,"Hey, you don't get to laugh."
1400,IGNER,Thanks a billion!
1401,LARRY,More like 4.3 billion!
1402,IGNER,Ow!
1403,LARRY,Ow!
1404,FRY,"Oh, I had a nightmare I was in the year 2000 and you guys never existed. I'm so glad I'm awake now and you're really here."
1405,LEELA,Since when do you care about us?
1406,BENDER,We thought you only cared about cans of anchovies and stuffy old songs about the buttocks.
1407,FRY,"No, that's not true!"
1408,LEELA,Goodbye-eee!
1409,BENDER,Wheee!
1410,TV.],
1411,FRY,"Bender! Leela! Don't leave me. Wait a minute! Hey, buddy what year is this?"
1412,REPOBOT,"Uh, 3000."
1413,FRY,3000? Yes! I'm still in the future! Life is wonderful!  Wait! What are you doing with my stuff?
1414,REPOBOT,"Uh, check bounced. We're taking it all back."
1415,FRY,"Oh, no, my ATM card! My secret PIN number! 1077. I've got nothing left. Except..."
1416,LEELA,You're Fry's relative. Do you have any idea how he got so crazy?
1417,FARNSWORTH,"Uh, wha? Oh, yes, they say madness runs in our family. Some even call me mad! And why? Because I dared to dream of my own race of atomic monsters. Atomic supermen with octagonal-shaped bodies that suck blood out of..."
1418,FRY,Leela! Bender! I missed you so much!
1419,LEELA,You did? What happened?
1420,FRY,I was robbed. They got everything except these.
1421,BENDER,Who did?
1422,MOM,"Hello, Fry."
1423,LEELA,It's Mom.
1424,MOM,I felt terrible when I heard about your money troubles and I thought maybe I could help out a sweet young man by buying his anchovies.
1425,FRY,Sorry. But the anchovies aren't for sale.
1426,MOM,"What? Listen, you little bastard. I control the robot oil business and I won't let you ruin me. How much do you want?"
1427,FRY,"You might as well put that chequebook away, because I've discovered something even more important. My friends. And they aren't worth even a penny to me. That's why these anchovies are going on a pizza, so I can share the food I love with the people I like."
1428,MOM,"Holy hell! You're going to eat them? Oh, well. Just make sure you eat them all. You're a growing boy. Toodle-oo! Dumb ass!"
1429,FRY,What a nice lady!
1430,FRY,"OK, my friends. Get ready for the most delicious extinct animal you've ever tasted."
1431,AMY,"I don't know, I've had cow.  Ew! Gross!"
1432,FRY,"Ah, no one likes them at first but they'll grow on you."
1433,ZOIDBERG,That stench. That heavenly stench! More!
1434,FRY,There aren't any more. And there never will be.
1435,ZOIDBERG,More! More! More! More!
1436,THE END,
1437,"""MY THREE SUNS""",
1438,BENDER,(singing) Going through the 'bot wash!
1439,BENDER,(singing) Goin' through the robot wash!
1440,BENDER,Ah!  Aww!
1441,ELZAR,"Hey, I'm Elzar! Welcome to the show! You know, you don't have to drive all the way to Neptune for great Neptunian food. Today we're gonna kick it up a notch as I show you how to fricassee a mouth-watering Neptunian slug.  Now while you grease the pan and preheat your oven to 3500 degrees you're gonna separate the yolk from your genetically-enhanced eggplant and then give the whole thing a good blast from your spice weasel - bam!"
1442,FRY,"Hey, what you watching?"
1443,BENDER,"Uh, nothing!"
1444,LEELA,Is that a cooking show?
1445,BENDER,"No, of course not! It was...uh...porno! Yeah that's it!"
1446,LEELA,Bender! I didn't know you liked cooking! That's so cute!
1447,BENDER,"(ashamed) Oh, it's true! I've been hiding it for so long."
1448,FRY,"Its OK, Bender, I like cooking too."
1449,BENDER (WHISPERING),Pansy!
1450,ELZAR,"Of course, your most important ingredient is this baby right here: the Neptunian slug. You can get it in a can but to really do things right you gotta strangle yourself a fresh one.  Now this is why you gotta use cast-iron cookware."
1451,HERMES,"Bender, man. It has come to my attention that this company has been paying you to do nothing but loaf about on the couch."
1452,BENDER,You call that a couch? I demand a pillow!
1453,HERMES,I'm sorry but if you want to continue drawing a salary you gotta do more than watch the cooking shows all day.
1454,BENDER,Hmm.
1455,FRY,You're gonna be the ship's cook?
1456,BENDER,Yeah! We're gonna kick it up a notch. Bam!
1457,LEELA,"I know you like cooking shows but you're a robot, you don't even have a sense of taste."
1458,BENDER,"Honey, I wouldn't talk about taste if I was wearing a lime green tank top."
1459,FRY,Bam!
1460,FRY,So this is Little Neptune?
1461,BENDER,Yep. Every chef knows that this is the place to get exotic gourmet ingredients.
1462,LEELA,Among other things.
1463,CRACK ADDICT,"Come on, man, don't hold out on me like this!"
1464,ORGAN DEALER,Psst! You want to buy organ?  Fresh and cheap. Ready for transplant!
1465,FRY,Ooh! What's this?
1466,ORGAN DEALER,Ah! Is X-Ray eyes. See through anything!
1467,FRY,Wait a minute! This says Z-Ray.
1468,ORGAN DEALER,"Z is just as good. In fact, is better. Is two more than X."
1469,FRY,"Hmm, I can see where that would be an advantage. Do you take cash?"
1470,LEELA,"Fry, you have to be more careful. We're not in the 20th century. You don't know how things work here."
1471,FRY,"I'm not a little kid, Leela. I grew up in this city. These are my people. What up?"
1472,ALIEN,Word!
1473,FRY,See?
1474,FRY,Wow! You guys sell every kind of meat here except human!
1475,LEELA,What's this spice for?
1476,LEELA,Oh! That's ridiculous. (whispering) I'll take two pounds!
1477,BENDER,"Hey, buddy. I'm looking for fresh slug."
1478,BENDER,Whatever.
1479,BENDER,"Yeah, yeah, either one's fine."
1480,LEELA,"Hey, have you seen Fry?"
1481,FRY,"Now that you mention it, I do have trouble breathing underwater sometimes. I'll take the gills."
1482,ORGAN DEALER,"Yes, gills. Then, uh, you don't need lungs anymore, is right?"
1483,FRY,Can't imagine why I would.
1484,ORGAN DEALER,"Lie down on table. I take lungs now, gills come next week.  (shouting) Nurse!"
1485,NURSE,Let's do it.
1486,ORGAN DEALER,You may feel small pain --
1487,BENDER,(shouting) Thank you!
1488,LEELA,What the hell were you doing? I warned you to stay away from those guys.
1489,FRY,"I'm capable of making my own decisions, Leela. Did you ever stop to think I might be happier with gills?"
1490,FARNSWORTH,"Good news, everyone..."
1491,BENDER,"Uh-oh, I don't like the sound of that."
1492,FARNSWORTH,...you'll be making a delivery to the planet Trisol...
1493,BENDER,Here it comes.
1494,FARNSWORTH,...A mysterious world in the darkest depths of the Forbidden Zone.
1495,BENDER,"Thank you, and goodnight."
1496,LEELA,"Uh, Professor, are we even allowed in the Forbidden Zone?"
1497,FARNSWORTH,"Why, of course! Its just a name! Like the Death Zone or the Zone Of No Return. All the zones have names like that in the Galaxy Of Terror!"
1498,LEELA,"Uh, Professor..."
1499,FARNSWORTH,"Off you go, pleasant trip."
1500,FRY,(shouting) Hey Bender how's dinner coming?
1501,BENDER,Almost ready!
1502,BENDER,Now for a dash of salt!  Uh-oh!
1503,LEELA,"(whispering) Listen, this is Bender's first meal and he's a little sensitive. So let's be supportive, OK?"
1504,FRY,"Yeah, OK."
1505,ZOIDBERG,Alright.
1506,LEELA,"(shouting) Oh, dear God!"
1507,FRY,That's the saltiest thing I've ever tasted. And I once a big heaping bowl of salt!
1508,AMY,"Bender, is this salt water?"
1509,BENDER,It's salt with water in it if that's what you mean.
1510,FRY,My vision's fading. I think I'm gonna die.
1511,BENDER,There was nothing wrong with that food. The salt level was 10% less than a lethal dose.
1512,ZOIDBERG,"Uh-oh, I shouldn't have had seconds."
1513,LEELA,"OK, Fry, here's the package to deliver and for once in your life be careful. This is my first visit to the Galaxy Of Terror and I'd like it to be a pleasant one."
1514,FRY,Ow!
1515,LEELA,"Don't touch anything or talk to anyone. Just go to the palace, drop it off and come right back."
1516,FRY,"Jeez, will you lay off! I was delivering things before you were born! I think I know what I'm doing."
1517,FRY,"Stupid slug. I've never been so thirsty. Oh, come on! Go down already!  Ah!"
1518,FRY,Hello? Anybody home?
1519,GUARD #1,The royal bottle is empty!
1520,GUARD #2,You drank our Emperor!
1521,FRY,No! It wasn't me!
1522,GUARD #1,You drank our Emperor! You assassinated him.
1523,FRY,I didn't mean to. He just looked so cool and refreshing.
1524,GUARD #3,I'm sure he was.
1525,GUARD #1,But now he's gone and your fate is sealed. All hail the new Emperor.
1526,GUARDS,(chanting) Hail! Hail! Hail!
1527,LEELA,"So after I specifically asked you not to touch anything, you drank a bottle of strange blue liquid? It could have been poisonous acid!"
1528,FRY,It could have been. But chances were equally good it was an Emperor.
1529,MERG,"Excuse me, Your Majesty, I am Merg, the High Priest. If I might interject?"
1530,FRY,You might.
1531,MERG,"I humbly advise that as your first act you choose a capable Prime Minister. I suggest Gorgak, the previous appointee."
1532,GORGAK,I will be a forceful and effective administrator.
1533,BENDER,"You know, Fry, I've often thought about becoming a Prime Minister."
1534,FRY,I gotta go with Bender.
1535,BENDER,"Yes! In your face, Gorgak!"
1536,LEELA,"That's it, Fry. As your captain I order you back to the ship. You are in way over your head."
1537,FRY,"Gee, you think so, Captain? I'd better check with my Prime Minister."
1538,BENDER,"Stay the course, pal!"
1539,GORGAK,"Your Highness, a package came for you."
1540,FRY,"Hey, thanks!  Wow! This got here just in time."
1541,MERG,This is Your Majesty's harem. You may choose any of these maidens to be your royal consort.
1542,FRY,"Umm, how about that one?"
1543,MERG,Oh! I didn't realise Your Majesty was into that sort of thing!
1544,FRY,"On second thought, I'll take that one."
1545,MERG,"Hey, whatever you say, I'm not here to pass judgement."
1546,LEELA,"Does anyone else think it's odd that a shiftless 25-year-old delivery boy could drop out of the sky, kill the emperor and be rewarded instead of punished?"
1547,FRY,"You don't have to beat around the bush, Leela, we all know who you're talking about...uh, me, right?"
1548,AMY,I don't think you have anything to worry about. These people seem really mild-mannered.
1549,ZOIDBERG,"They are mild. In fact, you're soaking in one right now."
1550,GORGAK,You touched me in ways I've never been touched before.
1551,MERG,"Ah, there you are, Your Majesty. It's time to begin preparing for tomorrow's coronation ceremony."
1552,ZOIDBERG,A fancy dress gala! I'll wear my formal shell.
1553,MERG,Fry will be enthroned tomorrow at the setting of the three suns when we Trisolians enter our nocturnal phase.
1554,FRY,"There won't be a lot of long-winded speeches, will there?"
1555,MERG,Only one. The absolutely flawless recitation from memory of the royal oath. By you.
1556,FRY,Will there be cake?
1557,ZOIDBERG,"Yeah, I know."
1558,AMY,Hi!
1559,FRY,There you go.
1560,GORGAK,"And now, get ready to laugh til your sides leak with our planet's foremost political satirist, Florp!"
1561,FLORP,"So what is the deal with people from under the orange sun? They're all... But us guys from under the red sun, we're like... Right? Am I right?"
1562,FRY,"Oh, yeah! Yeah, he's right!"
1563,LEELA,"(whispering) Fry, I have to talk to you. You're in terrible danger."
1564,LEELA,"You see Emperor Plon here?  He met his end when he was drunk by Emperor Strug. And before he could even wipe his mouth, Strug was drunk by Shwab."
1565,FRY,So?
1566,LEELA,Look at all these guys. Do you have any idea what the average length of their reigns was?
1567,FRY,"80,000 years?"
1568,LEELA,No. One week.
1569,FRY,Damn! I knew you wouldn't have asked unless it was really high or really low.
1570,LEELA,Every Emperor ascended to power by assassinating the previous one. And guess who's next?
1571,FRY,Well at least my assassin will get what's coming to him.
1572,LEELA,"You're in tremendous danger, you idiot! Half of these Emperors were drunk at their own coronation."
1573,FRY,"Hey, I plan on having a few brewskis myself."
1574,LEELA,"No, they were assassinated. In fact, the law says you'll be killed on the spot if you fail to recite the oath from memory."
1575,FRY,"Yeah, I was going to thumb through that later."
1576,LEELA,That is completely reckless. Don't you ever think ahead?
1577,FRY,"Hell, no. If I stopped to think ahead, I wouldn't be Emperor. And I wouldn't even be here in the year 3000. It's just like the story of the grasshopper and the octopus. All year long the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter while the octopus mooched off his girlfriend and watched TV. But then the winter came and the grasshopper died and the octopus ate all his acorns and also he got a racecar. Is any of this getting through to you?"
1578,LEELA,I give up! You're gonna get yourself killed and this time I won't be here to save you.
1579,FRY,Who asked you to? I told you a hundred times to stop treating me like a baby. Now go. Go gather your nuts you nagging grasshopper.
1580,LEELA,"That's it! I'm never helping you again! If anyone except you needs me, I'll be in the ship."
1581,FRY,I'll be fine. It's not like anyone's gonna drink me.  Quit it!
1582,MERG,"People of Trisol, it is my honour to present your new Emperor!"
1583,FRY,What up?
1584,MERG,Stick to the oath.
1585,FRY,"Right! I, Fry, who drank Bont the Viscous, who drank Ungo the Moist, who guzzled Zorn the Stagnant..."
1586,FRY,"...who slurped Hudge the Dewy, who enjoyed a soup composed principally of Throm the Chunky, do solemnly swear to rule with honour and insanity - uh, integrity!"
1587,MERG,"Congratulations, Your Highness.  I now present you with your royal unisex robe. Long live Fry The Solid!"
1588,BENDER,"Hey, look. The suns are setting. I can finally switch to hard liquor!"
1589,BENDER,"Check out the glowing freaks. It's beautiful! Hey, what's that?"
1590,MERG,The Emperor Bont! He's still alive.
1591,BONT,Of course I'm alive. Now cut this creep open and drain me out!
1592,FRY,My tummy hurts!
1593,BONT,"They're over here, they're running up the stairs."
1594,BENDER,"Shut up, you!"
1595,FRY,Ow!
1596,MERG,Let us in!
1597,MERG,Fry must die so that Bont may live.
1598,FRY,What am I gonna do?
1599,AMY,We've gotta get the Emperor out of your body before they kill you!
1600,ZOIDBERG,"Relax, Fry. I'll simply spin you in a high-speed centrifuge separating out the denser fluid of His Highness."
1601,FRY,But won't that crush my bones?
1602,ZOIDBERG,"Oh, right, right, with the bones! I always forget about the bones."
1603,BENDER,"Hey, why don't you just sweat him out?"
1604,BONT,Forget it! As Emperor I refuse to be dripped out through somebody's armpit.
1605,FRY,I could vomit or urinate. Would you feel better about that?
1606,BONT,Slightly. But my favourite so far is the bone-crushing.
1607,AMY,What about crying?
1608,FRY,That's a great idea! Crying.
1609,BONT,Fine. That or the bone one.
1610,MERG,"Keep it up, men. The veneer is starting to peel."
1611,GORGAK,"Oh, dear!"
1612,FRY,It's no use. I wanna cry but I'm just too macho.
1613,BENDER,"I'll make you cry, buddy!  You're a pimple on society's ass and you'll never amount to anything."
1614,FRY,What do you mean? I was Emperor of a whole planet.
1615,BENDER,Good point. But here's a disturbing reminder: Everyone you knew or loved in the 20th century is dead.
1616,FRY,These things happen.
1617,BENDER,"OK, Fry, grab a Kleenex for this one, 'cause there's no God and your idiotic human ideals are laughable!"
1618,FRY,Phew! That's a load off my mind.
1619,BENDER,"Man, I guess it's harder than I thought to make someone cry."
1620,AMY,"You did your best, Bender."
1621,BENDER,"Up yours, bimbo!"
1622,ZOIDBERG,"Let's face it, we're in hot butter here. We should call Leela for help."
1623,BENDER,"Cram it, lobster!  That is a good idea. I'll go call her."
1624,FRY,She'll never help me. She's still mad that I told her never to help me.
1625,AMY,C'mon. Leela's not the type to hold a grudge.
1626,OPERATOR,Collect call from...
1627,BENDER,I'm not giving my name to a machine.
1628,LEELA,I'll accept.
1629,BENDER,Fry's in trouble...
1630,BENDER,"...and he needs help. Now, I don't like you and you don't like me."
1631,LEELA,I like you.
1632,BENDER,You do? Look are you going to help or not?
1633,LEELA,I don't know why I should. I mean after what he --
1634,BENDER,"Wait, wait, wait, wait.  What is it you like best about me?"
1635,AMY,Is she coming?
1636,BENDER,I'm not sure. But I do know that she likes my in-your-face attitude.
1637,FRY,What the hell is that?
1638,BONT,"Its the Juice-A-Matic 4000. It'll strain my juices from you while filtering out the pulp. By which I mean, your shredded remains."
1639,ZOIDBERG,Of course! Why didn't I think of that!
1640,FRY,This is the saddest day of my life. And I still can't cry.
1641,BENDER,Wait a second. Here comes Leela.
1642,AMY,"Oh, no. They have her totally outnumbered."
1643,FRY,I can't believe it. She's risking her life for me after the way I treated her. I don't deserve this. I feel terrible.
1644,BENDER,You do? Hmm.
1645,FRY,Is she alright?
1646,BENDER,"I don't know. Perhaps I'll look out this window. Oh, dear God in heaven, they're swarming all over her."
1647,FRY,No. No!
1648,AMY,"What are you talking about, Bender? She's al --  (muffled) Oh!"
1649,BENDER,"They're strapping her to juicer. Oh, they're putting some ice cubes in the glass under it."
1650,FRY,This can't be happening.
1651,BENDER,"It can and, for all you know, it is. I'm sorry, Fry. She's dead."
1652,FRY,"All Leela ever wanted to do was help me. But I was to proud, too stupid to accept it.  I wish I had died instead of her."
1653,LEELA,What are you talking about?
1654,FRY,Leela! You're alive!
1655,LEELA,Of course I'm alive.
1656,BENDER,I told Fry you were dead so he would cry out the Emperor but you had to go and wreck it by surviving.
1657,AMY,We only got two drops.
1658,BONT,It's only a matter of time now.
1659,ZOIDBERG,I'll handle this!
1660,LEELA,"Listen, Fry, I think I can get us out of this if you're willing to let me help you."
1661,FRY,"Thanks, Leela. From now on, I'll take all the help you're willing to give. I know you just want what's best for me.  Ow! What was that for?  Hey, come on!  That hurt!"
1662,LEELA,"I know. Amy, get the bottle."
1663,FRY,"(crying) Oh, now I understand."
1664,LEELA,Come on. Everybody help out Fry.
1665,FRY,"(crying) Thanks, everybody. I love you all. You guys are true -- ow! Cut it out, Bender! That's a tender area!"
1666,LEELA,"How we doing, Amy?"
1667,AMY,Great! We're one-tenth of the way there.
1668,AMY,"OK, it's your turn."
1669,FRY,"Hey, wait a minute! Who are you?"
1670,BONT,I'm the Emperor! Thanks for crying me out.
1671,FRY,"Oh, you're welcome."
1672,BENDER,Hey! Save some for me!
1673,THE END,
1674,"""A BIG PIECE OF GARBAGE""",
1675,FARNSWORTH,"Good news, everyone. Tomorrow you'll be making a delivery to Ebola 9, the virus planet."
1676,HERMES,Why can't they go today?
1677,FARNSWORTH,Because tonight's a special night and I want all of you to be alive. It's the Academy of Inventors annual symposium.
1678,FRY,Wow! I love symposia.
1679,FARNSWORTH,It's the event of the scientific season. Every member presents an invention and the best one wins the Academy prize.
1680,BENDER,Sounds boring.
1681,FARNSWORTH,"Oh, my, yes. But not this year, because my latest invention is unbeatable. Behold! The death clock.  Simply jam your finger in the hole and this readout tells you exactly how long you have left to live."
1682,LEELA,Does it really work?
1683,FARNSWORTH,Well it's occasionally off by a few seconds. What with free will and all.
1684,FRY,Sounds like fun. How long do I have left to live?
1685,BENDER,Ooh! Dibs on his CD player!
1686,FARNSWORTH,"Oh, my, yes."
1687,FRY,Who's the gross nerd?
1688,FARNSWORTH,"That's me at the very first symposium. I'm the Academy's oldest living member, you know. These youngsters all look up to me."
1689,WERNSTROM,"Well, well, well. Look who decided to show his wrinkled face."
1690,FARNSWORTH,"Why don't you just leave me alone, Wernstrom?!"
1691,WERNSTROM,"Face it, Farnsworth, you're over the hill. It's time to leave science to the 120-year-olds."
1692,FARNSWORTH,You young turks think you know everything. I was inventing things when you were barely turning senile.
1693,WERNSTROM,"Go home before you embarrass yourself, old man. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to take a nap before the ceremonies."
1694,FRY,Who's that jerk?
1695,FARNSWORTH,A hundred years ago he was my most promising student at Mars University. But then after one fateful pop-quiz...
1696,WERNSTROM,A-minus? No one gives Ogden Wernstrom an A-minus!
1697,FARNSWORTH,I'm sorry but penmanship counts.
1698,WERNSTROM,I swear I'll have my revenge even if it takes me a hundred years.
1699,FARNSWORTH,And here it is: Slightly over 99 years later and still no revenge. I'm essentially in the clear.
1700,BENDER,"I've been perusing your fortified wine list and I've selected the '71 Hobo's Delight, the '57 Chateau Par-tay and the '66 Thunder Chevitz."
1701,WAITER,"Exquisite choices, sir."
1702,BENDER,And mix them all together in a big jug.
1703,POPEIL,"Welcome to this year’s Academy of Inventors Annual Symposium, I'm your host, Ron Popeil, inventor of Mr. Microphone, the spray-on toupee and - of course - the technology to keep human heads alive in jars.  But wait, there's more. We've got a whole line-up of inventors tonight, starting with that up and coming young star, Ogden Wernstrom."
1704,BENDER,(shouting) More wine!
1705,WERNSTROM,"Distinguished members of the Academy, I present to you, the Reverse SCUBA Suit. Observe!  Fetch!  Now, sit!  I said sit!  Bad fish!"
1706,FRY,"Don't worry, Professor, it's no competition for your death clock."
1707,WERNSTROM,"And what will you be presenting this evening, grandpa?"
1708,FARNSWORTH,Let's just say it'll put you young whippersnappers in your place!
1709,WERNSTROM,I just hope it's not as lame as that death clock you presented last year.
1710,FARNSWORTH,"Uh, last year, you say?"
1711,WERNSTROM,That's right.
1712,FARNSWORTH,"Oh, my! Did it put you young whippersnappers in your place?"
1713,WERNSTROM,"Hardly! We laughed until our teeth fell out. Come along, Cinnamon."
1714,FARNSWORTH,"Oh, dear, I'll have to invent something new in the next ten minutes. Perhaps some sort of death clock."
1715,LEELA,"Uh, Professor...?"
1716,POPEIL,"Our last presentation comes from our oldest member, Professor Hubert Farnsworth. Professor?"
1717,FARNSWORTH,"Just a second, just a second."
1718,WERNSTROM,"Pencils down, prune-face."
1719,FARNSWORTH,"Uh, yes, here I am, OK, now, hello there. Now, we all know telescopes allow us to see distant objects. But what if we want to smell distant objects? Well now we can! Thanks to my new invention...the Smellescope."
1720,MAN,"Oh, I say!"
1721,FARNSWORTH,"The odour travels past this coffee stain here, around the olive pit and into this cigar burn. And this appears to be a, doodle of myself as a cowboy. But the Smellescope is brilliant, I tell you! Think of the astronomical odours you'll smell thanks to me.  Oh, my!"
1722,WERNSTROM,"I've waited a hundred years for this, Farnsworth. I give your invention the worst grade imaginable: An A-minus-minus."
1723,POPEIL,"And now for the presentation of the award. Listen, folks, I'm practically giving this prize away to Dr. Wernstrom, for his fish thingy."
1724,FARNSWORTH,Perhaps 149 is just too old to be a scientist.
1725,BENDER,Yep!
1726,FRY,"No, Professor, don't give up. There were plenty of times in my century when I was gonna give up but I never did. Never! Hey, are you even listening to me? Oh, I give up!"
1727,FARNSWORTH,"By God, you're right! I'm going to build that Smellescope!"
1728,FARNSWORTH,Eureka!
1729,FRY,Did you build the Smellescope?
1730,FARNSWORTH,"No, I remembered that I'd built one last year. Go ahead. Try it. You'll find that every heavenly body has its own particular scent. Here, I'll point it at Jupiter."
1731,FRY,Smells like strawberries.
1732,FARNSWORTH,Exactly! And now Saturn.
1733,FRY,"Pine needles. Oh, man, this is great! Hey, as long as you don't make me smell Uranus."
1734,LEELA,I don't get it.
1735,FARNSWORTH,"I'm sorry, Fry, but astronomers renamed Uranus in 2620 to end that stupid joke once and for all."
1736,FRY,Oh. What's it called now?
1737,FARNSWORTH,"Urectum. Here, let me locate it for you."
1738,FRY,"No, no, I think I'll just smell around a bit over here!  Hmm.  Hmm."
1739,FARNSWORTH,"What is it?  Oh, jeez! Oh, man! Remarkable! A stench so foul is right off the funk-o-meter. I dare say Fry may have discovered the smelliest object in the known universe."
1740,BENDER,"Ooh, ooh, name it after me!"
1741,LEELA,I think it's moving.
1742,FARNSWORTH,"Hmm, perhaps the computer can calculate its trajectory.  My God! Whatever it is it's headed straight for us. With enough force to reduce this entire city to a stinky crater. We have less than 72 hours."
1743,BENDER,"Well, lets get looting!"
1744,FRY,So this thing's gonna destroy the whole city?  What the heck is it?
1745,FARNSWORTH,Ah! Just as I thought. The answer lies in this movie I found on the Internet.
1746,NARRATOR,"New York City: the year 2000. The most wasteful society in the history of the galaxy and it was running out of places to empty its never-ending output of garbage.  The landfills were full. New Jersey was full. And so, under cover of darkness, the city put its garbage out to sea on the world's largest barge. The repulsive barge circled the oceans for 50 years but no country would accept it. Not even that really filthy one. You know the one I mean. Finally, in 2052, the city used its mob connections to obtain a rocket and launch the garbage into outer space. Some experts claim the ball might return to Earth someday, but their concerns were dismissed as ""depressing""."
1747,FRY,Wow! You got that off the Internet? In my day the Internet was only used to download pornography.
1748,FARNSWORTH,Actually that's still true.
1749,FEMALE SCIENTIST,"Now that the garbage is in space, doctor, perhaps you can help me with my sexual inhibitions."
1750,MALE SCIENTIST,With gusto!
1751,FARNSWORTH,"So that's the situation. Due to the short-sightedness of Old New York, New New York is going to be destroyed by a giant ball of garbage."
1752,LEELA,"Fry, what the hell were you people thinking back then? How could you just throw your garbage away?"
1753,FRY,"Hey, hey, gimmie a break! What do you do with it?"
1754,LEELA,We recycle everything. Robots are made from old beer cans.
1755,BENDER,Yeah! And this beer can is made outta old robots.
1756,LEELA,And that sandwich you're eating is made of old discarded sandwiches.  Nothing just gets thrown away.
1757,FRY,The future is disgusting.
1758,LEELA,Typical 20th century attitude.
1759,FRY,"Hey! You have no right to criticise the 20th century. We gave the world the lightbulb, the steamboat and the cotton gin."
1760,LEELA,Those things are all from the 19th century.
1761,FRY,"Yeah, well, they probably just copied us."
1762,FARNSWORTH,Please! There's no time for this now. This is an emergency. We must warn the mayor.
1763,POOPENMEYER,"Garbage ball, huh? That sounds serious."
1764,FARNSWORTH,"Very serious, Mayor Poopenmeyer."
1765,POOPENMEYER,I gotta be sure this isn't another scientific fraud like global warming or second-hand smoke.  Send in my science advisor.
1766,FARNSWORTH,Wernstrom!
1767,WERNSTROM,"Well, well, well! Come to present your latest napkin, Professor?"
1768,FARNSWORTH,"No, I'm here because a giant trash ball is heading straight for us. Smell for yourself."
1769,POOPENMEYER,Hey! Holy jeez!
1770,WERNSTROM,"That smell could be anything; A faulty stench coil, some cheese on the lens, who knows?"
1771,WOMAN,"Mr. Mayor, we just got this transmission from Neptune."
1772,MAN,Giant...garbage ball.....passed close by...horrible stench......
1773,WOMAN,"The transmission cuts out there, sir. No, I, guess it keeps going."
1774,WOMAN,There we go.
1775,POOPENMEYER,My God! The senile old man is right.
1776,WERNSTROM,Do you mean him or me?
1777,POOPENMEYER,Him!
1778,LINDA,"Next, New New York in crisis. Morbo?"
1779,MORBO,"Thanks, human female. Puny Earthlings were shocked today to learn that a ball of garbage will destroy their pathetic city of New New York."
1780,LINDA,Makes me glad we live here in Los Angeles.
1781,MORBO,Morbo agrees!
1782,LEELA,Can't we just shoot a missile at it?
1783,MILITARY MAN,We've simulated that on a supercomputer but the ball is just too damn gooey. A missile would go right through it.
1784,FARNSWORTH,But suppose we send a crew to plant an explosive precisely on the fault line betwen this mass of coffee grounds and this deposit of America Online floppy disks.
1785,MILITARY MAN,"In theory, it could work."
1786,WERNSTROM,"Uh, in theory, perhaps. But you'll never find a crew willing to take on a mission so suicidal-y dangerous."
1787,BENDER,"Oh, crap!"
1788,FARNSWORTH,"Now, you'll only have one chance to destroy the ball. After that, it will be so close to Earth that blowing it up would cause garbage to rain over the entire planet, killing billions."
1789,BENDER,"(ironic) Oh, boo-hoo!"
1790,FARNSWORTH,"Now here's the bomb I've prepared. Once you activate it, you'll have 25 minutes to get away."
1791,LEELA,That's all? But --
1792,FARNSWORTH,"Now, now, there'll be plenty of time to discuss your objections when and if you return."
1793,LEELA,Odour at magnitude 8.  Magnitude 12. Magnitude 31.  We're breaking up. Turn on the anti-smell device.
1794,FRY,"Hmm, sporty!"
1795,FRY,Wow!
1796,LEELA,Look at all this filth.
1797,FRY,It's not filth. It's a glorious monument to the achievements of the 20th century. Look! A real Beanie Baby.  Oh! A Mr. Spock collector's plate!  Some Bart Simpson dolls!
1798,DOLL,Eat my shorts!
1799,BENDER,OK  (à la Homer Simpson) Mmm! Shorts!
1800,LEELA,"Fry, this stuff was garbage when it was new. Let's blow it up already!"
1801,FRY,This junk isn't garbage! I can dig in any random pile and find something great.
1802,FRY,"(gasping) Alright, let's get to work."
1803,LEELA,"Let's see. If that's Hypodermic Ridge then the bomb must go right here.  Get ready to run. We've got 25 minutes. Uh, 15 minutes.  5 minutes.  6h minutes?"
1804,BENDER,There's your problem. The Professor put the counter on upside-down.
1805,LEELA,"That idiot! It wasn't set for 25 minutes, it was set for 52 seconds."
1806,FRY,We're gonna die! (calmly) Right?
1807,BENDER,Right!
1808,BENDER,It's gonna blow!
1809,LEELA,"Hey, watch it! You'll put somebody's eye out!"
1810,BENDER,"OK, OK, keep your space pants on. I'll take care of this."
1811,FRY,We're saved!
1812,LEELA,"Yeah, but this garbage ball's unstoppable now. New New York is done for."
1813,LINDA,"All in all, this is one day Mittens the kitten won't soon forget!"
1814,MORBO,"Kittens give Morbo gas. In lighter news, the city of New New York is doomed. Blame rests with known human Professor Hubert Farnsworth and his tiny, inferior brain."
1815,FARNSWORTH,"Oh, how could I have put that bomb timer on upside-down? I could swear I followed the manual precisely.  I'm a dried up husk of a scientist. This is all my fault."
1816,FRY,"No, it's my fault too. I'm sure I threw out more than my share of that trash up there. Also, one month my toilet broke and it just went straight in the garbage can.  Leela was right. The people of the 20th century were idiotic slobs. Especially me."
1817,POOPENMEYER,Enough! You all failed miserably. It's time to put a real scientist in charge.
1818,FARNSWORTH,Wernstrom!
1819,WERNSTROM,The very same.
1820,POOPENMEYER,"Dr. Wernstrom, can you save my city?"
1821,WERNSTROM,Of course. But it'll cost you. First I'll need tenure.
1822,POOPENMEYER,Done.
1823,WERNSTROM,And a big research grant.
1824,POOPENMEYER,You got it.
1825,WERNSTROM,"Also, access to a lab and five graduate students, at least three of them Chinese."
1826,POOPENMEYER,"Um, alright done. What's your plan?"
1827,WERNSTROM,"What plan? I'm set for life! Au revoir, suckers!"
1828,LEELA,That rat! Do something!
1829,POOPENMEYER,"I wish I could but, he's got tenure!"
1830,POOPENMEYER,"It's time to take action.  Stephanie, cancel the maid for today. Have her come tomorrow.  Well, I'm out of ideas. Anyone?"
1831,FARNSWORTH,"Wait! If we could build an object the exact size, density and consistency of the garbage ball, it might just knock the ball away without smashing it to bits."
1832,LEELA,But where can we find a substance the exact density and consistency as garbage?
1833,FARNSWORTH,"Alas, I don't know."
1834,FRY,"Uh, what about garbage?"
1835,FARNSWORTH,Good Lord! A second ball of garbage! That just might work!
1836,POOPENMEYER,But garbage isn't something you just find lying in the streets of Manhattan. This city's been garbage-free for 500 years!
1837,FRY,Then it's time to make some more.
1838,POOPENMEYER,Make garbage? But how?
1839,FRY,Stand back and watch the master! This Slurm can.  Now it's garbage. These papers.  Garbage. This picture of your wife.  Pure garbage. Now you try it.
1840,POOPENMEYER,"By God, I think the boy's got something. Come on, everyone! The fate of the city is at stake!"
1841,FRY,"Good!  Don't finish that cruller, throw it away  Bender. Drink that beer and drop the bottle on the ground.  Very nice."
1842,POOPENMEYER,Get that robot some more beer!  We've trashed this room but that's just the start. We've got to get Fry's message to the people.
1843,FRY,People of New New York. Take a lesson from the 20th century. Stop all this pain-in-the-ass recycling and throw your garbage on the floor.
1844,FRY,Go ahead. Just chuck it any old place like I used to. Your city is counting on you.
1845,FARNSWORTH,"If my calculations are correct, this garbage ball will knock the other garbage ball directly into the sun."
1846,WERNSTROM,"And if my calculations are correct, we're all going to die horribly."
1847,POOPENMEYER,"Alright, places everyone. Prepare for launch."
1848,FARNSWORTH,"Five, four, three, two, three, four, five, six..."
1849,LEELA,Just fire the damn thing.
1850,FRY,Oops!
1851,FARNSWORTH,Burning garbage!
1852,FRY,It worked!
1853,POOPENMEYER,"And so, on behalf of the entire city, I thank you, Professor Farnsworth. I now present you with the Academy prize, which we confiscated from Dr. Wernstrom after it became apparent that he was a jackass."
1854,FARNSWORTH,"Yes! In your face, Wernstrom!"
1855,WERNSTROM,"I'll get you, Farnsworth. Even if it takes me another hundred years."
1856,POOPENMEYER,"And, Fry, we owe you a tremendous debt as well. If not for your 20th century garbage-making skills, we'd all be buried under 20th century garbage."
1857,LEELA,"Should we really be celebrating? I mean, what if the second garbage ball returns to Earth like the first one did?"
1858,FRY,Who cares? That won't be for hundreds of years.
1859,FARNSWORTH,Exactly! It's none of our concern.
1860,FRY,That's the 20th century spirit!
1861,FUTURAMA,
1862,"""HELL IS OTHER ROBOTS""",
1863,FRY,This is awesome! I've been waiting a thousand years to see a Beastie Boys show.
1864,BENDER,Can I get anybody a beer?
1865,FRY,Sure!
1866,ANNOUNCER,"Ladies and gentlemen, here to lay down some old, old, incredibly old school beats: The Beastie Boys!"
1867,BEASTIE BOYS,(singing) Well now don't you tell to smile
1868,LEELA,Impressive. They're busting mad rhymes with an 80% success rate.
1869,BENDER,I believe that qualifies as ill. At least from a technical standpoint.
1870,FRY,Will you guys shut up! I'm trying to look cool.
1871,BEASTIE BOYS,(singing) ...known for the Flintstone Flop
1872,MIKE,Drop!  Ow! How's it going?  Enjoying the show? Ow!  (shouting) Don't forget to pick up a T-Shirt!
1873,FRY,Wow! An old-fashioned mosh pit! Come on guys. Tonight we're gonna party like its 1999...again.
1874,LEELA,"Ow! Hey, watch it!"
1875,FRY,"Man, these guys rock harder than ever!"
1876,MIKE (SINGING),Oh my...
1877,MCA (SINGING),...it's a mirage...
1878,AD-ROCK (SINGING),...tellin' you all it's a...
1879,AD-ROCK (SINGING),"Sabotage, yeah!"
1880,MIKE,"Peace, we out!"
1881,FENDER,"Hey, Bender!"
1882,BENDER,"Hey, Fender! Man, I haven't seen you since high school. You still workin' at Jack In The Box?"
1883,FENDER,"Not anymore, baby. I'm with the band!"
1884,MIKE,"Aw! Oh, yeah!"
1885,FENDER,"Hey, fellas, hey. I want you to meet my friends Bender, Fry and Leela."
1886,AD-ROCK,"Y'know we're, really not that interested in meeting them."
1887,FRY,"Wow! I love you guys! Back in the 20th century, I had all five of your albums."
1888,AD-ROCK,That was a thousand years ago. Now we got seven.
1889,FRY,Cool! Can I borrow the new ones? And a couple of blank tapes?
1890,FENDER (WHISPERING),"Hey, Bender, why don't we ditch these organ sacks and hit the real party?"
1891,BENDER,Count me in! I'm gonna drink til I reboot!
1892,BENDER,"Hey, what kinda party is this? There's no booze and only one hooker."
1893,FENDER,"Don't be a drag, man. We're jacking on!  Aww yeah!  Wanna jolt?"
1894,BENDER,"Uh hey, I'm no square but isn't that counter-indicated by my operations manual?"
1895,ROBOT,Counter indicated!
1896,FENDER,"Come on, Bender, grab a jack. I told these guys you were cool."
1897,BENDER,"Well, if jacking on'll make strangers think I'm cool, I'll do it!"
1898,FENDER,"Easy, baby. You don't wanna get hooked on this stuff."
1899,BENDER,"Eh, no need to worry. I don't have an addictive personality."
1900,FRY,Hey uh Bender. What are we doing in this bad neighbourhood?
1901,BENDER,"Shut up, square!  I'll just be a minute!"
1902,PREACHERBOT,Wretched sinner unit! The path to robot heaven lies here......in the Good Book 3.0.
1903,BENDER,Hey! Do I preach to you when you're lying stoned in the gutter? No! So beat it!
1904,FRY,Who was that guy?
1905,BENDER,Yo mama! Now shut up and drag me to work!
1906,HERMES,Our electric bill's climbing faster than a green snake up a sugarcane. Obviously someone round been wastin' a whole heap a juice! Probably you!
1907,ZOIDBERG,Me?
1908,AMY,"Good morning, Bender."
1909,BENDER,"None of your business, get off my back!"
1910,AMY,What's his problem?
1911,LEELA,If I didn't know better I'd almost think he was abusing electricity.
1912,FRY,Bender? No way!  I definitely would've noticed something.
1913,LEELA,"Bender, why are you spending so much time in the bathroom? Are you jacking on in there?"
1914,BENDER,No! Don't come in!
1915,FARNSWORTH,"Good news, everyone! Today you'll be delivering a crate of subpoenas to Sicily 8, the Mob Planet!"
1916,BENDER,"Alright, let's get to work! I'll be out in a second."
1917,FRY,I know Big Vinnie said he was giving me the kiss of death but I still think he was gay.
1918,LEELA,Did he use his tongue?
1919,FRY,"A little.  You OK, Bender?"
1920,BENDER,None of your business! Get off my back!
1921,LEELA,Uh oh. There seems to be some sort of electrical disturbance in the Coalsack Nebula.
1922,BENDER,A what kind of disturbance?
1923,LEELA,Electrical. Anyway it's going to take some careful piloting to avoid it.
1924,LEELA,We're out of control. We're heading straight into the electric field!
1925,FRY,What's happening? I-I feel weird!
1926,BENDER,"Come on universe you big, mostly empty wuss! Gimmie all the juice you got! Oh, mama!"
1927,BENDER,What?
1928,LEELA,"Bender, we didn't mind your drinking, or your kleptomania, or your pornography ring."
1929,ZOIDBERG,"In fact, that's why we loved you."
1930,LEELA,But this electricity abuse crossed the line. You almost killed us.
1931,FRY,And you made me feel like a jerk for trusting you. Just like when my friend Richie swore he wasn't taking drugs and then he sold me my mom's VCR and then later I found out he was taking drugs. You make me ashamed to be your friend.
1932,BENDER,You're right. I'm a lost cause.
1933,BENDER,Maybe there's another way.
1934,BENDER,"Oh, yeah, that's the good stuff.  (crying) What am I doing? What have I become? Huh?"
1935,PREACHERBOT,"I see a lot of fancy robots here today. Made of real shiny metal. But that don't impress the Robot Devil, no, sir!"
1936,ROBOT,"No, sir!"
1937,PREACHERBOT,"'Cause if you're a sinner, he's gonna plug his infernal modem in the wall, belchin' smoke and flame. Amd he's gonna download ya straight to Robot Hell!"
1938,ROBOT,Straight to hell!
1939,PREACHERBOT,So I ask ya: Who will stand up and be saved? Who? Who?
1940,BENDER,(weakly) Me.
1941,HERMES,"And as a further cost-cutting measure, I have eliminted the salt-water cooler."
1942,ZOIDBERG,This is a witch hunt!
1943,BENDER,"(singing) Oh, what a beautiful morning, oh what a beautiful day! (talking) Greetings, friends. Don't we all look nice today?"
1944,FRY,Great he's whacked out on electricity again.
1945,BENDER,"No, I'm whacked out on life. My friends, I found religion."
1946,FRY,Religon? Is this another scam to get free yarmulkes?
1947,LEELA,"Give him a break, Fry. If this helps Bender clean up his act then I think we should be supportive."
1948,FARNSWORTH,Yes.
1949,AMY,"Oh, yeah."
1950,HERMES,"Oh, yes!"
1951,ZOIDBERG,"Oh, yeah."
1952,BENDER,"Wonderful. Then you'll all come to my exceedingly long, un-air-conditioned baptism ceremony!"
1953,PREACHERBOT,"We are gathered here today to deliver brother Bender from the cold, steel grip of the Robot Devil unto the cold, steel bosom of our congregation."
1954,ROBOT #2,"Tell it, Preacher!"
1955,ROBOT #3,That equals true.
1956,PREACHERBOT,"Brother Bender, do you accept the principles of Robotology on pain of eternal damnation in Robot Hell?"
1957,BENDER,"Yes, I do."
1958,PREACHERBOT,Then I will now baptise you.  Press any key to continue.
1959,BENDER,"Uh, while you're at it, could you touch up this seam?"
1960,LEELA,This is unbelievable. The old Bender never would have taken us out to dinner.
1961,BENDER,The old Bender's gone. He won't trouble you anymore.
1962,WAITER,Would monsieur care to see the wine list?
1963,BENDER,"No poison for us, thanks. I'll stick with good old mineral oil.  Ah! Functional!"
1964,HERMES,"Mon, I'm hungrier than a green snake in a sugar cane field!"
1965,BENDER,Friends! Friends! Surely you're not going to eat before we say Robot Grace? In the name of all that is good and logical we give thanks for the chemical energy we are about to absorb. To quote the prophet Jerimatic: 1000101010101...
1966,BENDER,...0010110012. Amen.
1967,FRY,Does that mean we can eat now?
1968,BENDER,"Yes.  But first, since I love you all so much, I'd like to give everyone hugs. Come here, Fry!"
1969,FRY,"Oh, uh, but I don't want to."
1970,BENDER,"Mmm! Mmm! Fry, you're my friend!  C'mon, everyone line up for a hug. Let's tear down some emotional walls."
1971,LEELA,What are you doing to my ship?
1972,BENDER,Sanctifying it!  There! That ought to convert a few tailgaters.
1973,FRY,Bender's stupid religion is driving me nuts.
1974,LEELA,Amen.
1975,FARNSWORTH,If only he had joined a mainstream religion like Oprah-ism or Voodoo.
1976,FRY,We've got to get the old Bender back.
1977,LEELA,"And I think I know a way to do it. We have to reacquaint him with a little thing called ""sleaze""."
1978,BENDER,I can't believe somebody hired an interstellar spaceship to deliver a package to Atlantic City. What are we delivering anyway?
1979,FRY,"Uh, this."
1980,BENDER,Where are we delivering it to?
1981,LEELA,"Uh, here."
1982,BENDER,Another job well done. Now back to the office for an enjoyable evening of fasting and repentance.
1983,FRY,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, Bender. So long as we're here why don't we take in some, exotic dancing!"
1984,LEELA,"Hey, great idea!"
1985,BENDER,"But, those girls don't wear cases. You can see their bare circuits."
1986,FRY,"Come on, it'll be fun! Maybe we could even drink a little fortified wine."
1987,BENDER,"What?"" Drinking wine is a sin. Even if it is deliciously fortified."
1988,LEELA,"Hey, Bender, looks at that woman's purse. It's hanging by a spaghetti strand."
1989,BENDER,Thou shalt not snatch.
1990,FRY,And there's Hookerbot 5000. She's got a heart of solid gold!
1991,HOOKERBOT,"Hey, sailing unit!"
1992,BENDER,Stop tempting me! For once in my life I have inner peace.
1993,FRY,"Pfft, that's for losers. C'mon, sin your heart out."
1994,LEELA,Go nuts.
1995,HOOKERBOT,Live a little.
1996,WOMAN,Could you hold my purse for a minute?
1997,FRY,"Go for it, Bender. You know you wanna!"
1998,BENDER,Well...
1999,BENDER,I'm the greatest.  Woo-hoo!
2000,FRY,Look's like we got the old Bender back!
2001,BENDER,"You know it, pork pie! Except for one thing."
2002,BENDER,"Y'know, as a major Hollywood director I'll be holding auditions tonight for my next movie. And even though you're all young and naive, I think you might just have what it takes.  Hey! I'm trying to score here! Can't you read the ""Do Not Disturb"" sign?  No! No!"
2003,ROBOT DEVIL,"Greetings, Bender! Welcome to Robot Hell."
2004,LEELA,What in hell happened to Bender?
2005,FRY,"Well he didn't check out. The ashtray's still here.  Look, Nibbler's caught the scent of vodka and motor oil! Go, boy. Follow that stench."
2006,BENDER,"I'm hallucinating this, right?"
2007,ROBOT DEVIL,"No, Bender. Robot Hell is quite real. Here's our brochure."
2008,BENDER,But I don't belong here. I don't like things that are scary and painful.
2009,ROBOT DEVIL,"Sorry, Bender, you agreed to this when you joined our religion. If you sin you go to Robot Hell - for all eternity."
2010,BENDER,"Aww, hell - I mean heck!"
2011,ROBOT DEVIL,"It's alright, you can say that here."
2012,FRY,Wait! I remember this place. They shut it down after all those people caught salmonella from the flume ride.
2013,LEELA,Hmm. Look! It's the symbol of Bender's old religion.
2014,FRY,"Unbelievable. It's an actual, factual Robot Hell."
2015,LEELA,Who would've thought hell would really exist? And that it would be in New Jersey!
2016,FRY,Actually --
2017,ROBOT DEVIL,We know all your sins Bender and for each one we've prepared an agonising and ironic punishment. Gentlemen?
2018,BENDER,"Aw crap, singing. Mind if I smoke?"
2019,ROBOT DEVIL,(singing) Cigars are evil
2020,ROBOT DEVIL,"(singing) Gambling's wrong and so is cheating,"
2021,BENDER,(singing) Just tell me why.
2022,ROBOT DEVIL,(singing) Please read this 55-page warrant.
2023,BENDER,(singing) There must be robots worse than I.
2024,ROBOT DEVIL,"(singing) We've checked around, there really aren't."
2025,BENDER,"(singing) Then please let me explain,"
2026,ROBOT DEVIL,"(singing) You stole from boy scouts, nuns and banks!"
2027,BENDER,"(singing) Ah, don't blame me blame my upbringing!"
2028,ROBOT DEVIL,(singing) Please stop sinning while I'm singing!
2029,ROBOT DEVIL,"(singing) Selling bootleg tapes is wrong,"
2030,BEASTIE BOYS,"(singing) Hey, Bender, gonna make some noise,"
2031,FRY,(singing) I don't feel well.
2032,LEELA,(singing) It's up to us to rescue him.
2033,FRY,(singing) Maybe he likes it here in hell.
2034,LEELA,(singing) It's us who tempted him to sin.
2035,FRY,(singing) Maybe he's back at the motel.
2036,LEELA,"(singing) Come on, Fry, don't be scared,"
2037,FRY,(singing) My ass has blisters from the slide.
2038,ROBOT DEVIL,"(singing) Fencing diamonds,"
2039,FRY,"Bender, are you alright?"
2040,BENDER,No! Oh they're tormenting me with up-tempo singing and dancing.
2041,LEELA,"Alright, Beelzebot, what'll it take to get our friend back?"
2042,ROBOT DEVIL,"Sorry, but I hold all the cards here. There's nothing I can do. Now, if you'll just sign this fiddle contest waiver."
2043,LEELA,Wait. What fiddle contest?
2044,ROBOT DEVIL,"The Fairness In Hell Act of 2275 requires me to inform you that if you can best me in a fiddle contest, you win back Bender's soul. As well as a solid gold fiddle."
2045,FRY,Wouldn't a solid gold fiddle weigh hundreds of pounds and sound crummy?
2046,ROBOT DEVIL,Well it's mostly for show.
2047,LEELA,(whispering) Do you know how to play the fiddle?
2048,FRY,"(whispering) No, do you?"
2049,LEELA,"(whispering) No, but I used to play the drums. They're sorta similar. (talking) What happens if we lose?"
2050,ROBOT DEVIL,"You'll only win a smaller, silver fiddle. Also I guess I'll kill one of you, uh, him."
2051,LEELA,We'll do it.
2052,ROBOT DEVIL,"Very well, then. Beat this."
2053,BENDER,"Well, we're boned."
2054,ROBOT DEVIL,Your turn.  Ha!
2055,LEELA,Time for the drum solo!
2056,FRY,Run!
2057,ROBOT DEVIL,Stop them! They cheated!
2058,LEELA,"Hurry, Bender!"
2059,BENDER,I could if you'd drop the stupid gold violin!
2060,LEELA,"Oh, sorry."
2061,BENDER,"Don't worry, guys, I'll never be too good or too evil again. From now on, I'll just be me."
2062,LEELA,"Uh, do you think you could be just little less evil than that."
2063,BENDER,I don't know. Do you think you could survive a 700ft fall?
2064,FRY,Good old Bender!
2065,THE END,
2066,BEASTIE BOYS,"Yeah, Yeah! This one goes out to my man, Bender"
2067,FUTURAMA,
2068,"""A FLIGHT TO REMEMBER""",
2069,LEELA,That was the worst delivery ever.
2070,FRY,Yeah. I'm never going to another planet called Cannibalon!
2071,BENDER,"Me neither. (upbeat) Food was good, though."
2072,FARNSWORTH,"Oh, great news, everyone."
2073,BENDER,Shove it! We quit!
2074,FARNSWORTH,In that case I'll have to hire a new crew to go on our company vacation.
2075,LEELA,Vacation?
2076,BENDER,Alright!
2077,FRY,This is great! I haven't had time off since I was 21 through 24.
2078,FARNSWORTH,It's just my way of thanking you for not reporting my countless violations of safety and minimum wage laws.
2079,BENDER,"Aww, you!"
2080,FARNSWORTH,"I've booked us all on the maiden voyage of the largest, most luxurious space cruise ship ever built.  The Titanic!"
2081,LEELA,Looks nice.
2082,FRY,"Hey, uh, where's my suitcase?  Ow!"
2083,POOPENMEYER,"As Mayor of New New York, it's my pleasure to introduce the honorary captain for the Titanic's maiden voyage. A man who single-handedly defeated the Retiree People of the Assisted Living Nebula: Zapp Brannigan!"
2084,LEELA,"Oh, God! Not Zapp Brannigan!"
2085,ZOIDBERG,You know Zapp Brannigan?
2086,LEELA,"Let's just say we've ""crossed paths""."
2087,BENDER,Was that before or after you slept with him?
2088,ZAPP,"She's a beautiful ship alright. Shapely, seductive. I'm gonna fly her brains out.  And now, without further adieu, I christen this ship, Titanic."
2089,ZAPP,"Well, well, well! The Lady Leela. Take notes, Kif. You're about to witness the subtle waltz known as seduction. So, trapped on a ship with me. What say you and I knock some very sensual boots?"
2090,LEELA,"It's tempting, but, uh, I have a fiancé now. Uh, hmm, uh, hmm, uh, we--, uh ...  Him! Fry, darling, meet Zapp Brannigan."
2091,FRY,Huh?  Ooh! How do you do?
2092,FARNSWORTH,"Ah, here's my stateroom."
2093,BENDER,"Come on, where is it?  Ohh!"
2094,FARNSWORTH,"Now, Hermes, you and your lovely wife LaBarbara have the suite through there. And Dr. Zoidberg, your marble tank is on the other side."
2095,FRY,"Man, first class seems nice!"
2096,FARNSWORTH,It'll seem even nicer once you've seen your room.
2097,AMY,Looks like we're on the Fiesta Deck.
2098,LEELA,This is it.
2099,FRY,Well at least we get a window!
2100,BENDER,"Well, I'm tired of this room and everyone in it. If you'll excuse me, I'm gonna pop over to the casino for the next 135 hours!"
2101,AMY,I think I'll go and fill up on bisque at the buffet.
2102,FRY,I guess that just leaves you and your fake fiancé ... all alone ... on a romatic cruise.
2103,LEELA,Take it off or I'll break it off.
2104,FRY,
2105,ZAPP,Captain's inspection!
2106,BENDER,"Hmm.  I'm bettin' it all!  Come on, baby needs a new pair of feet!"
2107,CROUPIER,Snake eyes.
2108,BENDER,No! My cheating unit malfunctioned! You gotta give me a do-over!
2109,CROUPIER,"Sorry, the house limit is three do-overs. Next shooter."
2110,BENDER,"Gimmie you're biggest, strongest, cheapest drink."
2111,IZAC,You got it!
2112,BENDER,Allow me to introduce myself. I'm Bender.
2113,COUNTESS,Charmed. I'm the Countess de la Roca. I was surprised to see another robot staying in first class. Most of the robots I meet are labourers.
2114,BENDER,"I assure you, I barely know the meaning of the word ""labour""."
2115,COUNTESS,"Oh, Mr. Bender!"
2116,BENDER,"Please, call me Bender."
2117,COUNTESS,"(embarrassed) Oh, goodness. I don't--"
2118,ZAPP,"Kif, I'm feeling the captain's itch."
2119,KIF,"I'll get the powder, sir."
2120,ZAPP,"No, the itch for adventure! Prepare to change course."
2121,KIF,"Sir, this is a leisure cruise. Our path was set by the travel agency."
2122,ZAPP,That's for schoolgirls! Now here's a route with some chest hair.
2123,KIF,But that course leads directly through a swarm of comets.
2124,ZAPP,"Yes, comets! The icebergs of the sky. By jackknifing from one to the next at breakneck speed we might just get some kind of gravity boost ... or something. It's time to shove a jalapeño up this ship's tailpipe.  Divert power from the shields, full speed ahead!"
2125,AMY,Oh yeah--!
2126,MRS. WONG,Amy! Hello!
2127,AMY,Mom? Dad? What are you doing here?
2128,MR WONG,"We were planning on enjoying a relaxing vacation. But since you're here, we'll have to do some meddling."
2129,MRS WONG,We met the nicest boy in the cabin next to ours.
2130,MR WONG,He's not very ugly.
2131,MRS WONG,You should marry him! Or at least use him to conceive a grandchild for us.
2132,MR WONG,There he is at the buffet!
2133,AMY,"Uh, he seems really nice but, well, I already have a boyfriend."
2134,MRS WONG,Really? Where is he?
2135,MR WONG,And why isn't he here right now fathering our grandchild?
2136,AMY,Uh ...
2137,LEELA,"Well, our accommodations aren't great but it sure is beautiful our here."
2138,FRY,"Yeah, it's pretty romantic-- Uh, I mean platonic. Th-That sure is one platonic view!"
2139,LEELA,"Fry, just be quiet. I'm beginning to think this whole fake fiancé thing was a terrible, terrible--"
2140,FRY,Hmm? Mmmm!
2141,ZAPP,"Leela, perhaps this is an awkward time but if things don't work out with this pipsqueak here ...  ... I just want you to know I'll be there to score you on the rebound."
2142,LEELA,"Uh, look, before you get any crazy ideas, that was for Zapp."
2143,FRY,"Well, you got anything else for him?"
2144,LEELA,"Alright, can we try not to complicate this?"
2145,AMY,"Mom, Dad. I'd like you to meet Fry, my boyfriend."
2146,FRY,Hmm? Mmmm!
2147,FRY,"See you later, wuvvums!"
2148,LEELA,It would have been nice if you'd told me you were going out with Amy.
2149,FRY,"I'm not going out with Amy. It's just to fool her parents. Hey, you're not jealous, are you?"
2150,LEELA,What? No. No! Of course not!
2151,FRY,"Good, 'cause I consider my fake relationship with you a lot more meaningful."
2152,COUNTESS,Mind if I freshen up a bit before we go out?
2153,BENDER,I was just about to suggest the same thing.  Pay dirt!
2154,COUNTESS,"Lovely, isn't it?"
2155,BENDER,Yeah. But only 93% as lovely as you.
2156,COUNTESS,"Oh, Bender! Either that was a computing error or you're the most romantic robot I've ever met!"
2157,BENDER,"I don't get it, iZac: That bracelet had a diamond the size of a racoon's brain. Why couldn't I steal it?"
2158,IZAC,"It's obvious, Mr. B, you're in love."
2159,BENDER,"Oh, it's true. But we're star-crossed robots. She, a countess built with a silver spoon in her mouth. And me, just a regular honest Joe."
2160,IZAC,"Hey, you gonna pay for those?"
2161,BENDER,"Hell, no!"
2162,IZAC,Security to bar area. Security to bar area.
2163,BENDER,"Fellas, please. I'm in love!"
2164,IZAC,Rough him up!
2165,COUNTESS,What are you doing?
2166,IZAC,"This penniless chump was stealing drinks, ma'am."
2167,COUNTESS,"I see. Here you are, sir ...  ... keep the change."
2168,IZAC,You got it!
2169,ZOIDBERG,Aha!
2170,FRY,"Go, Professor!"
2171,AMY,Lean back more!
2172,FARNSWORTH,Ow!
2173,LABARBARA,"Come on, Hermes, you could out-limbo all of these people!"
2174,HERMES,"Don't be a dog heart, woman. You know I can't. Not after what happened."
2175,ANNOUNCER,Now limboing for the Earth team: Hermes Conrad.
2176,BOY,"(shouting) You're my hero, Hermes! I'm gonna be just like you!"
2177,HERMES,"No, boy, stop! It's too low! Your backbone can't take it!"
2178,BOY,I'm just like Hermes! I'm just like--
2179,HERMES,(screaming) Nooo!
2180,LABARBARA,"There, there. Now you don't have to limbo if you don't want. It doesn't make you any less of a man."
2181,FARNSWORTH,Though it did get me some action!
2182,HATTIE,I like a man who's flexible!
2183,ZAPP,"Your attention, please. As captain of this vessel, the terrible burden of naming a limbo contest winner is mine and mine alone."
2184,KIF,Shouldn't you be steering between the comets?
2185,ZAPP,"And the winner is, Leela!"
2186,LEELA,But I didn't even limbo.
2187,ZAPP,"No matter. I know from personal experience how horizontal you can get. As your reward, you and that hairpile are invited to dine at the captain's table this evening."
2188,BENDER,"Well, now you know. I'm not actually rich. I'm a fraud. A poor, lazy, sexy fraud. This isn't even a real bow-tie -- it's magnetic."
2189,COUNTESS,"Bender, I don't care whether you have money. I love you for your artificial intelligence and your sincerity simulator."
2190,BENDER,You do? Really?
2191,ZAPP,"I like your style, Fry. You remind me of a young me. Not much younger, mind you. Perhaps even a couple of years older."
2192,FRY,"Thank you, sir."
2193,ZAPP,"As a gentleman, I must warn you. If you so much as glance at another woman, I'll be all over Leela like a fly on a pile of very seductive manure."
2194,FRY,"Well, rest assured, Leela's the only girl for me."
2195,AMY,"Hey, Fry."
2196,LEELA,Amy!
2197,AMY,Leela!
2198,ZAPP,"Ah, the family Wong. Our party is complete."
2199,LEELA,(whispering) What are we gonna do? Fry can't pretend to be both our boyfriends.
2200,FRY,(whispering) Sure I can. I learned how to handle delicate social situations from a little show called Three's Company.
2201,ZAPP,I'd like to impose a toast on the happy couple. Down the hatch!
2202,MRS WONG,"Hear, hear! Now lets have a kiss!"
2203,ZAPP,"Yes, Fry. Plant one on your woman."
2204,FRY,"Um, let me think. Come and knock on our door, nuh nuh nuh nuh nuh nuh. Uh, Mr Roper--"
2205,MR WONG,What's the hold up? Kiss my daughter already!
2206,FARNSWORTH,"Wait, I'm confused. Now tell me, Fry, which one of these ladies are you involved with?"
2207,FRY,Uh ...
2208,KIF,"Captain, may I have a word with you?"
2209,ZAPP,No.
2210,KIF,"It's an emergency, sir."
2211,ZAPP,"Come back when it's a catasrophe.  Oh, very well."
2212,AMY,"Well, with Zapp gone and my parents still here, I suggest Fry give me a nice, convincing kiss."
2213,FRY,"Ah, now there's something we can all enjoy."
2214,KIF,"Sir, remember your course correction?"
2215,ZAPP,No.
2216,KIF,Well it's proving somewhat more suicidal than we'd initially hoped.
2217,ZAPP,"Kif, old friend, I don't know which disgusts me more: Your cowardice or your stupidity! We'll simply set a new course for that empty region over there. Near that black-ish hole-ish thing."
2218,FRY,"Hey, Leela, why'd you run off from dinner?"
2219,LEELA,I didn't run off. I had plenty of time to finish eating and stroll away while you were kissing Amy.
2220,FRY,"Oh, look, I'm not actually interested in her if that's what's bothering you."
2221,LEELA,"Oh, are you sure? I mean, she has two eyes, you have two eyes."
2222,FRY,"I know, we seem like a perfect match, but I just don't feel that way about her."
2223,LEELA,Nice nebula.
2224,FRY,Yeah.
2225,LEELA,Look's like everybody's got somebody. Except me.
2226,FRY,And me.
2227,LEELA,"What was that?  Oh, my God! We're heading straight into a black hole."
2228,FRY,Talk about a mood killer!
2229,ZAPP,"Don't blame yourself, Kif. We were doomed from the start. Nothing remains now but for the captain to go down with his ship."
2230,KIF,"Why, that's surprisingly noble of you, sir."
2231,ZAPP,"No, it's noble of you, Kif!  As of now ...  ... you're in command. Congratulations, captain!"
2232,LEELA,OK. We just have to get from here to the escape pods.
2233,FARNSWORTH,(shouting) I'm too young to die!
2234,LEELA,"Come on, before its too late!"
2235,BENDER,"You all go without me. I'm gonna take one last look around. You know, for, uh, stuff to steal."
2236,FRY,"You're going back or the Countess, aren't you?"
2237,BENDER,"(whispering) Alright, I am. But I don't want the others to know. If I don't come back, just say I died robbing some old man."
2238,FRY,"I'll tell them you went out prying the wedding ring off his cold, dead finger."
2239,BENDER,"I love you, buddy!"
2240,BENDER,(shouting) Countess? Countess?
2241,COUNTESS,(shouting) I fell through the deck.
2242,BENDER,"(shouting) Are you hurt, my sweet?"
2243,COUNTESS,(shouting) No. Luckily a family broke my fall.
2244,BENDER,Just hang on! I'll take care of that fire!
2245,COUNTESS,"Bender, you risked your life to save me."
2246,BENDER,"And I'd do it again. And perhaps a third time. But that would be it.  When we kiss, I feel like I'm standing waist deep in a pool of cold, rising water."
2247,LEELA,Hurry! The escape pods should be just ahead!
2248,HERMES,(gasping) Faster!
2249,LEELA,It won't move. And the door release is on the other side.
2250,FRY,Then we're dead meat. No one could squeeze under there!
2251,HERMES,"No one, except a legendary limbo champion."
2252,LABARBARA,"Oh, Hermes!"
2253,HERMES,Ooh! It's been a while.  This one is for that little kid who's limboing up in heaven right now.
2254,LABARBARA,"That's my man, alright, baby, limbo!"
2255,HERMES,"I still got the moves! Zoidberg, lower the door another inch."
2256,LABARBARA,"Just go on through and hit the release, you hot dog!"
2257,HERMES,"Yes, dear."
2258,LABARBARA,That's my man!
2259,AMY,"Yay, Hermes!"
2260,HERMES,"Uh, can somebody help me up?"
2261,COUNTESS,"Well, now what are we going to do?"
2262,BENDER,Wait a second. Aren't you a member of the yacht club?
2263,COUNTESS,"By God, you're right! I'm a class-3 yacht."
2264,FARNSWORTH,Thank God there are plenty of escape pods; We won't have to dress up like women and children.
2265,LEELA,We can't leave yet. We've got to wait for Bender. The high gravity must be slowing down his looting.
2266,MRS WONG,Amy!
2267,AMY,Mom? Dad? You're alive!
2268,MR WONG,Yeah but so what? The important thing is we found you a new man.
2269,MRS WONG,A captain.
2270,AMY,"Uh, Mom, I don't--  Hi!"
2271,KIF,(sexfully) Hello!
2272,FARNSWORTH,I don't feel well!
2273,FRY,Look! It's our nebula. Whenever I see it I'll think back to that moment when we almost--  Never mind!
2274,HERMES,Everyone else is off the ship. Where in Babylon is Bender?
2275,LEELA,I don't know. But we can't wait any longer.
2276,FRY,"Goodbye, Bender."
2277,BENDER,(shouting) Wait for us!
2278,LEELA,Something's wrong. We're two metric tons overweight.
2279,AMY,"Well, its not me!"
2280,FRY,Look!
2281,COUNTESS,"I'm slipping, Bender. The pull is too strong!"
2282,BENDER,"I can't live without you. If you let go, I let go!"
2283,COUNTESS,"No! You have too much to live for. It may hurt for a while but one day you'll share your love again. After all, it's shareware."
2284,BENDER,Don't talk like that. Tragic romances always have a happy ending.
2285,COUNTESS,(shouting) Farewell!
2286,BENDER,Nooo!
2287,BENDER,She's gone.
2288,LEELA,"But she saved all our lives. Without her, we're light enough to get away."
2289,FRY,"Don't cry, Bender. Nobody really knows what happens in a black hole. It's possible she's still alive in another dimension somewhere. Right, Professor?"
2290,FARNSWORTH,"Oh, yes, absolutely!  Not a chance!"
2291,BENDER,At least I'll always have her bracelet! What do you think it's worth?
2292,HERMES,"It's fake, mon!"
2293,THE END,
2294,"""MARS UNIVERSITY""",
2295,FARNSWORTH,"Good news, everyone.  We've got a very special delivery today."
2296,FRY,Who's it going to?
2297,FARNSWORTH,Me.
2298,BENDER,Another job well done.
2299,FARNSWORTH,"No, I need it shipped to my office at Mars University.  It's a little experiment that may well win me the Nobel Prize."
2300,LEELA,In what field?
2301,FARNSWORTH,"I don't care, they all pay the same."
2302,FRY,Is it dangerous?
2303,FARNSWORTH,"Oh, my, no.  Off we go!"
2304,FRY,Very impressive. Back in the 20th century we had no idea there was a university on Mars.
2305,FARNSWORTH,"Well, in those days Mars was just a dreary, uninhabitable wasteland, uh, much like Utah. But unlike Utah, it was eventually made livable, when the university was founded in 2636."
2306,LEELA,"They planted traditional college foliage: ivy, trees, hemp. Soon the whole planet was terraformed."
2307,FRY,Does that mean it's safe to breathe the air?
2308,FARNSWORTH,Of course.
2309,FARNSWORTH,Over here is Wong Library. It has the largest collection of literature in the Western universe.
2310,BENDER,Hey look. There's a chapter of my old robot fraternity; Epsilon Rho Rho.
2311,LEELA,You went to college?
2312,BENDER,"Of course, I'm a bender. I went to Bending College. I majored in Bending."
2313,FRY,What was your minor?
2314,BENDER,Robo-American Studies.
2315,FRATBOT #1,Are you here to fumigate the moose head?
2316,BENDER,"Uh, no, actually I'm an Epsilon from way back."
2317,FRATBOT #1,"Eh, close enough. C'mon in."
2318,BENDER,Thanks. Here's your finger back.
2319,BENDER,All the coolest robots are in this fraternity.
2320,FRATBOT #2,Mate in 143 moves.
2321,FRATBOT #3,"Oh, poo, you win again!"
2322,BENDER,"Uh-oh, nerds!"
2323,FRATBOT #1,"Allow me to introduce myself. I'm Gearshift, chapter president. This is Oily, and this here is Fatbot."
2324,BENDER,You're all losers. My name's Bender.
2325,OILY,"Bender from Bending State Bender? Wow, you're a legend around here!"
2326,FATBOT,"I heard that in one single night you drank a whole keg, streaked across campus and crammed 58 humans into a phone booth."
2327,BENDER,"(modest) Yeah, well, a lot of 'em were children. Anyway I should get going."
2328,GEARSHIFT,"No, Bender, wait. We're the lamest frat on campus. Even Hillel has better parties than us. Please, you've gotta stay and teach us how to be cool."
2329,BENDER,"Hmm, OK. But I'll need 10 kegs of beer, a continuous tape of Louie Louie and a regulation two-storey panty-raid ladder."
2330,FATBOT,"Oh, boy! Oh, boy! Oh, boy!"
2331,FRY,"I tell you, being here really takes me back to my college days."
2332,MAN #1,"Step right up, who wants to learn physics?"
2333,MAN #2,Keep your hands inside the car at all times.
2334,FRY,Good old Coney Island College! Go Whitefish!
2335,LEELA,"Don't take this the wrong way, Fry, but you don't seem like the educated type."
2336,FRY,"Oh, yeah?  Read it and weep. I'm a certified college dropout."
2337,LEELA,Please! Everyone knows 20th century colleges were basically expensive daycare centres.
2338,FARNSWORTH,"That's true. By current academic standards, you're merely a high school dropout."
2339,FRY,"What?! That's not fair. I deserve the same respect any other college dropout gets. By God, I'm gonna enroll here at Mars University and drop out all over again!"
2340,LEELA,You won't last two weeks.
2341,FRY,"Aww, thanks for believing in me."
2342,AMY,"Yo, classmate. What you takin'?"
2343,FRY,"Oh, I don't know.  Hey, Professor, what are you teaching this semester?"
2344,FARNSWORTH,Same thing I teach every semester: The mathematics of quantum neutrino fields. I made up the title so that no student would dare take it.
2345,FRY,Mathematics of wanton burrito meals. I'll be there!
2346,FARNSWORTH,"Please, Fry, I don't know how to teach; I'm a professor!"
2347,FRY,See you in class!
2348,FARNSWORTH,Oh!
2349,FATBOT,This is gonna be great!
2350,BENDER,Bingo!
2351,FATBOT,"Oh, mama!"
2352,BENDER,"Oh, yeah! Someone's been a bad computer! Get a load of that!"
2353,MEIDERNEYER,"I say, you've damaged our servants' quarters ... and our servants."
2354,CHET,This time Robot House has gone too far.
2355,BENDER,Cheese it!
2356,FATBOT,(screaming) They're gonna catch us!
2357,FRY,"Hey, pretty nice for a single. Two desks, two chairs, a couple of beds.  A woodpecker."
2358,LEELA,I think that's probably your roommate.
2359,FRY,"Oh, right, cool. (shouting) C'mon in, roomie!  (talking) What the--?"
2360,MONKEY,I call top bunk!  Ahh!
2361,FRY,My roommate's a monkey?
2362,MONKEY,"(sarcastic) Brilliant deduction, you're a credit to your species."
2363,FARNSWORTH,"Ah, Fry, I see you've met Guenter!"
2364,FRY,You know each other?
2365,FARNSWORTH,Guenter is my experiment. He was the top secret contents of this stinking crate.
2366,GUENTER,I'd rather live in a crate than share a room with this dork.
2367,LEELA,So what makes Guenter talk?
2368,FRY,Is he genetically engineered?
2369,FARNSWORTH,"Oh, please! That's preposterous science-fiction mumbo-jumbo. Guenter's intelligence actually lies in his electronium hat which harnesses the power of sunspots to produce cognitive radiation."
2370,GUENTER,"You're wasting your breath, Professor. He'll never understand a word of it."
2371,FRY,"I understood the word ""hat""!"
2372,FARNSWORTH,"Please, stop bickering. I arranged that you be roommates for a reason: So I'd only have to remember one phone number. Now shake hands and make up."
2373,FRY,You want a banana?
2374,GUENTER,I don't eat bananas. I prefer banana-flavoured energy bars made from tofu.
2375,FRY,I don't like you.
2376,FRY,This is gonna be a cakewalk!
2377,TEACHER,"Welcome to the history of the 20th century. Look to your left, then to your right. Then in nine other directions. One of the 12 of you will not pass this class."
2378,AMY,Boring.  Let's hear about Walter Mondale already!
2379,TEACHER,Be forewarned: The only sure way to get an A in this class is to have lived in the 20th century.
2380,FRY,Swish!
2381,TEACHER,"You were saying, Mr. Fry?"
2382,FRY,"I'm from the 20th century. Go ahead, ask me anything."
2383,TEACHER,Very well. What device invented in the 20th century allowed people to view broadcast programmes in their own homes?
2384,FRY,Ooh ... I know this ... whatyya call it? Lite Brite!
2385,GUENTER,I believe the answer is the television.
2386,TEACHER,Very good Mr ...  ... Guenter.
2387,AMY,(impressed) Wow! Smart and cute!
2388,VERNON,What I love about being dean of students is the peace and quiet and the respect I receive.  Now what's all this about?
2389,WOMAN,"Dean Vernon, the students from Robot House are here."
2390,VERNON,Robot House!
2391,BENDER,"Hey, dean, nice looking model."
2392,VERNON,"You keep away from it. You robots are a disgrace to this university. Whenever a fire alarm is pulled, it's Robot House. Whenever the campus liquor store is looted, Robot House. Whenever a human corpse is desecrated--"
2393,BENDER,"Now, I can explain that."
2394,VERNON,"That's enough out of you. From this day forth, Robot House is on dodecatupple-secret probation!"
2395,BENDER,No fair!
2396,FATBOT,My mom is gonna kill me!
2397,VERNON,"Now if you'll excuse me, I have to get back to the one thing that's kept me sane these past eight years: My model ship."
2398,GEARSHIFT,Fatbot! No!
2399,FATBOT,When I get nervous I get hungry.
2400,BENDER,Cheese it!
2401,VERNON,(shouting; from inside) Robot House!
2402,FRY,"So, Chrissy, we seem to be hitting it off. If you're not doing anything later might I escort you to a kegger?"
2403,CHRISSY,Not even if you were the last man on Mars.
2404,GUENTER,(shouting) Hey! You like bananas?
2405,GUENTER,(shouting; from outside) I got her number. How do you like them bananas?
2406,FARNSWORTH,"And therefore, by process of elimination, the electron must taste like grapeade."
2407,FRY,"Sorry, I overslept."
2408,FARNSWORTH,Until 5pm?
2409,FRY,It's that obnoxious monkey. He kept me up all night with his constant thinking. Just thinking and thinking. He's trying to make me look like an idiot.
2410,FARNSWORTH,"Don't be jealous. Without his special hat, Guenter might be no more intelligent than you."
2411,FRY,I hate that rodent!
2412,FARNSWORTH,"Fry, that monkey is my most important experiment. If you two don't stop fighting I'll have you both neutered."
2413,FRY,That'll show him.
2414,AMY,"Dean Vernon, I'd like you to meet my parents, Leo and Inez."
2415,VERNON,"Ah, Mr. and Mrs. Wong, I'm so glad we could admit Amy in exchange for your generous contribution."
2416,MR. WONG,How much more for Phi Beta Kappa?
2417,VERNON,How much you got?
2418,GUENTER,"Sorry I'm late, I was off at a study session ... with Chrissy!"
2419,FARNSWORTH,"Oh, I'm glad you made it, Guenter because in honour of parents weekend I have a special surprise for you."
2420,GUENTER,(horrified) Mom? Dad? What are you doing here?  This is so humiliating.
2421,FRY,Now these monkeys I like!  What's that? You wanna come out?
2422,GUENTER,No! Stop!
2423,CHET,I say.
2424,FARNSWORTH,What's that they're flinging at us?
2425,GUENTER,"Oh, dear Lord, all over the dean!"
2426,FRY,"Hey, uh, Guenter? Why don't you get up on the chandelier with your parents and I'll take a picture?"
2427,BENDER,"Well, looks like the party's winding down. Let's take a road trip to Tijuana and get Fatbot some action."
2428,FATBOT,"It's my first time, I'm really nervous."
2429,VERNON,(shouting) Robot House!
2430,LEELA,"What you did to Guenter was cruel. At the risk of sounding like an after-school special, I think we learned who the real animal was today."
2431,FRY,You mean peer pressure?
2432,FRY,Look out! He's got a gun!
2433,GUENTER,(crying) Leave me alone.
2434,LEELA,"Hey, what's going on? I thought you didn't like bananas."
2435,GUENTER,(crying) Of course I do. I try so hard to fit in but seeing my parents act like that made me realise I'm just a primative beast.
2436,FRY,"Hey, hey, cheer up. Not everyone turns out like their parents. I mean, look at me. My folks were honest hardworking people."
2437,LEELA,"Besides, Guenter, you're not like other monkeys. You've got the hat."
2438,GUENTER,"(crying) So what? I mean, sure, it looks cool and it makes me smart but it doesn't make me happy."
2439,LEELA,That's so sad. I didn't even know monkeys could cry.
2440,GUENTER,(crying) They can't. It's all the hat.
2441,FRY,"Look, Guenter, if you're so miserable here, maybe you should just go back to the jungle."
2442,GUENTER,"The jungle. But I couldn't do that to the Professor. I'm his prize experiment, and he's like a father to me."
2443,LEELA,But he's not your father. That guy in the punch bowl was your father.
2444,FARNSWORTH,"Look at him, I'm so proud."
2445,FRY,"Thanks, Professor!"
2446,FARNSWORTH,Not you.
2447,FRY,(screaming) Ow!
2448,STUDENT,Hey!
2449,FARNSWORTH,"Oh, I always feared he might run off like this. Why? Why? Why didn't I break his legs?"
2450,FARNSWORTH,"(crying) Oh, poor Guenter."
2451,LEELA,So he just ran away in the middle of the exam?
2452,FARNSWORTH,I'm afraid so. All he handed in was a paper smeared with faeces. He tied with Fry.
2453,FRY,I guess he realised I was right when I told him to go back to the jungle.
2454,FARNSWORTH,You what? After I spent months slaving over a hot monkey brain?
2455,FRY,"Hey, don't blame me. You tried to force Guenter to be a human but he's an animal. He belongs in the wild. Or in the circus on one of those tiny tricycles. Now that's entertainment."
2456,FARNSWORTH,"But Guenter's obviously better off being intelligent. Tell him, Leela."
2457,LEELA,"Nuh-uh, I'm staying out of this. Now here's my opinion: What we should do is..."
2458,FARNSWORTH,What?
2459,LEELA,I said we'll go to the jungle and let Guenter decide once and for all.
2460,FARNSWORTH,What?
2461,VERNON,"You all know the rules. Whichever house wins the regatta becomes head of the Greek Council. And should that house currently be on any type of multiple secret probation, it will be lifted and I will be forced to serve as Grand Marshal of a parade honouring them."
2462,CHET,"I say, Robot House, your water craft is as ill-designed as you yourselves."
2463,MEIDERNEYER,"Good one, Chet!"
2464,BENDER,"Oh, yeah? Watch this!"
2465,CHET,"Well, I never!"
2466,VERNON,"Fraternities, on your marks."
2467,BENDER,Hey!
2468,FRY,"Wow"" The jungles on Mars look just like the jungles on Earth."
2469,FARNSWORTH,Jungles? On Earth?
2470,LEELA,I see some movement up there. I think it's him.
2471,FARNSWORTH,Stand back.
2472,LEELA,Oops.
2473,FARNSWORTH,Don't worry. They'll be fine once the tranquiliser wears off.
2474,FRY,There's our man!
2475,LEELA,"Professor, you'll offer Guenter the hat and, Fry, you'll offer him the banana. We'll let him choose whether he wants to be intelligent or just a mindless animal."
2476,FARNSWORTH,"Come on, Guenter, take the hat."
2477,FRY,"No, the banana, the banana!"
2478,FARNSWORTH,Consider the philosophical and metaphysical ramifications of the--
2479,FRY,"Banana, banana, banana!"
2480,LEELA,"Wait, what's that sound?"
2481,GEARSHIFT,"(shouting) Hey, Bender, you sure this is a short-cut?"
2482,BENDER,(shouting) Not as sure as I was an hour ago!
2483,VERNON,And the winner is ...  ... Robot House?!
2484,FARNSWORTH,"Oh, dear Lord!"
2485,LEELA,No! No!
2486,FARNSWORTH,"Thank God this log is sturdy.  (shouting) Put on the hat, Guenter! You're the only one who can save us!  (muttering) Stupid monkey."
2487,FRY,No.
2488,LEELA,Not there.
2489,FARNSWORTH,Keep trying.
2490,GUENTER,Eureka! The hat goes on the head. It's all so obvious now!
2491,LEELA,"(shouting) Help us, Guenter!"
2492,GUENTER,"Oh, my goodness. (shouting) Hang on. I need to do some calculations.  Got it!  Grab on!"
2493,FARNSWORTH,We're saved!
2494,FRY,'Preciate it Guenter!
2495,LEELA,"Oh, no! Hurry, Guenter, climb up the vine. You can still save yourself."
2496,GUENTER,"Why bother? I've got nothing to live for. I was miserable as a genius, and as a monkey, I was so dumb I tried to wear a hat on my butt.  (sadly) There's just no place for me in this world. (normal) Although, on the other hand--"
2497,FARNSWORTH,"Oh, that poor, sweet monkey. Well lets go gather him up. There's no sense letting him go to waste."
2498,FRY,Guenter! You're alive!
2499,GUENTER,I guess the hat must have broke my fall.
2500,FARNSWORTH,"It seems to be working at only half-capacity, but I can fix it."
2501,GUENTER,"No, wait! I like it like this. I actually feel sort of happy."
2502,FARNSWORTH,But what about your super-intelligence?
2503,GUENTER,When I had that there was too much pressure to use it. All I want out of life is to be a monkey of moderate intelligence who wears a suit. That's why I've decided to transfer to business school!
2504,FARNSWORTH,(screaming) Nooo!
2505,BENDER,"(shouting) Come on, everyone! Big party in Robot House!"
2506,THE END,
2507,"""WHEN ALIENS ATTACK""",
2508,FRY,"Pizza delivery! Wow, so this is a real TV station, huh?"
2509,TECHNICIAN,"Well, it's a Fox affiliate."
2510,FRY,What are you showing right now?
2511,TECHNICIAN,Single Female Lawyer. It's the season finale. Wanna watch?
2512,FRY,"Ah, I dunno. That's a chick show. I prefer programmes of the genre ""world's blankiest blank""."
2513,TECHNICIAN,She is wearing the world's shortiest skirt.
2514,FRY,I'm in!
2515,JUDGE,"Counselor, I remind you that it's unethical to sleep with your client. If you really care about the outcome of the case, you should sleep with me."
2516,SINGLE FEMALE LAWYER,"Your Honour, it's bad enough to proposition a single female lawyer in court, but this is a unisex bathroom."
2517,JUDGE,"Overruled, counselor!"
2518,STENOGRAPHER,Could you repeat that last part?
2519,TECHNICIAN,"Oh, my God! You've knocked Fox of the air!"
2520,FRY,Pfft! Like anyone on Earth cares.
2521,STENOGRAPHER,Could you repeat that last par--
2522,LRRR,This is an outrage! I demand to know what happened to the plucky lawyer and her compellingly short garment.
2523,FOX ANNOUNCER,"Due to technical difficulties, we now bring you eight animated shows in a row."
2524,HERMES,"What in the name of Bob Marley's ghost? Get to work, you lazy boat bag!"
2525,BENDER,Ow!
2526,FRY,"Ow! Hey, quit it, Hermes. It's Labor Day."
2527,HERMES,Labor Day? That phoney-baloney holiday crammed down our throats by fat-cat union gangsters?
2528,FRY,That's the one.
2529,HERMES,"Hot damn, a day off!"
2530,LEELA,Who's up for one last summer beach trip?
2531,BENDER,"Aw, yeah!"
2532,HERMES,Ready Freddy!
2533,FRY,"(unenthusiastic) Eh, I think I'll just stay here."
2534,LEELA,"Fry, you're wasting your life sitting in front of that TV. You need to get out and see the real world."
2535,FRY,But this is HDTV. It's got better resolution than the real world!
2536,LEELA,Everyone's too polite to say anything but you're covered with bed sores.
2537,FRY,Not covered!
2538,LEELA,Just get in the car.
2539,FARNSWORTH,"Ah, here we are: Monument Beach!"
2540,FRY,"Wait, Mount Rushmore and the Leaning Tower of Pisa? I didn't know they were both in New York!"
2541,LEELA,"They are now. In the 2600's New Yorkers elected a super-villain governor, and he stole most of the world's monuments."
2542,BENDER,Truly a great man. Look at him up there.
2543,HERMES,Aha!  Found you!
2544,BENDER,"OK, now you go hide.  Nice knowin' you."
2545,FARNSWORTH,"Come on, Zoidberg, I passed it right to you."
2546,ZOIDBERG,I've had it with this game! I'm going for a scuttle!
2547,BENDER,"OK, everyone, come and get it!"
2548,FRY,"Ah, just like my dad used to make ... until McDonald's fired him."
2549,BENDER,"Bite my red-hot glowing ass.  Wait a minute. Red-hot glowing ass?  (calmly) I'll be right back!  Ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow!  Aw, yeah!"
2550,AMY,"No, Nibbler!  (whispering) Psst, Professor, I need another bikini."
2551,FARNSWORTH,"Eh ... wha?  Oh, oh, OK, I think there's one can left.  Oh, my."
2552,AMY,There. How do I look?
2553,FARNSWORTH,Like a cheap French harlot.
2554,AMY,French?!
2555,BULLY,"Say, doll-face, how'd you like to make time with a real man?"
2556,LEELA,No. I'm not attracted to bullies. No matter how big and ...  ... handsome they are.
2557,FRY,"It's OK, Leela, go ahead. I got a lot of work to do."
2558,BULLY,"Uh, sir, you don't understand. I'm a professional beach bully. I pretend to steal your girl, you punch me, I go down, she swoons, you slip me 50 bucks."
2559,FRY,50 bucks?! Not even if she was my girlfriend. You take her.
2560,LEELA,Fry! Although I suppose we could go for a walk along the beach.
2561,BULLY,"Uh, no thanks, ma'am, I'm actually gay."
2562,ZOIDBERG,"Uh-oh.  Help! Help!  Bender, you gotta spring me. I'll never survive in here; I'm too pretty!"
2563,BENDER,"Alright, alright, I'll bust you out. Cheese it!"
2564,FRY,Voila. The greatest sandcastle ever built. This is the kind of castle King Arthur would have lived in -- If he were a fiddler crab.
2565,LEELA,It's very nice. We should get a picture before the tide comes in.
2566,FRY,"Ooh, yeah. Anyone have a camera?"
2567,BENDER,"Right here, buddy.  Wait, I wanna be in the picture too.  Pretend you're happy."
2568,ZOIDBERG,Yay!
2569,LEELA,"Oh, my God!"
2570,HERMES,What in Babylon?
2571,FRY,(screaming) Nooo!
2572,HERMES,Faster!
2573,FRY,"We're all gonna die, aren't we?"
2574,FARNSWORTH,"Oh, I should think so. Although last time aliens invaded all they did was force the most intelligent of us to pair off and mate continuously. (chuffed) Oh, yes!"
2575,LINDA,"Once again, today's winning lotto number was 4. In other news, alien saucers continue to rain destruction upon Earth. We now go live to an emergency address by Earth President McNeal."
2576,MCNEAL,"Ladies and gentlemen, our course is clear. The time has come to knuckle under. To get down on all fours and really lick boot. Give our alien masters whatever they want a--"
2577,LRRR,"People of Earth, I am Lrrr of the planet Omicron Persei 8.  Is this thing on? Now then: We want the one you call ""McNeal"". Give us McNeal or we will lay waste to your cities with our anti-monument laser. We demand McNeal!"
2578,MCNEAL,"Uh, as I was saying ...  ... mankind would sooner perish than kowtow to outrageous alien demands for this McNeal ... whoever he is. Am I right?  And now, the man who will lead us in our proud struggle for freedom, fresh from his bloody triumph over the pacifists of the Gandhi Nebula, 25-star General Zapp Brannigan!"
2579,MAN,Yeah!
2580,BENDER,"Hey, look, Leela, it's that idiotic windbag you slept with."
2581,LEELA,The Earth is under attack. Can't we just forget about that?
2582,BENDER,Evidently not.
2583,ZAPP,"Call me cocky, but if there's an alien out there I can't kill, I haven't met him and killed him yet. But I can't go it alone.  That's why I'm ordering every available ship to report for duty. Anyone without a ship should secure a weapon and fire wildly into the air."
2584,LEELA,"Well, you heard the windbag: We've been drafted. Everyone into the ship."
2585,BENDER,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on. I refuse to fight. I'm a conscientious objector."
2586,FRY,A what?
2587,BENDER,"You know, a coward."
2588,ZAPP,Since this is an emergency all robots will now have their patriotism circuits activated.
2589,BENDER,"It is every robot's duty to give his life for the good of humanity.  Oh, crap!"
2590,ZAPP,"We're all from different cultures here. Some of you are white, some of you are black.  You're brown.  And you're silver. But I don't care if your skin's red or tan or Chinese. You're all going to have to learn to die together.  Am I right, soldier?"
2591,BENDER,"Well actually I--  Sir, yes sir! Sir!"
2592,ZAPP,"Remember, our mission is simple: Destroy all aliens!"
2593,KIF,"Um, uh, not me, sir."
2594,ZAPP,"Oh, yes, right. Nobody destroy Kif ... (quietly) unless you have to.  (talking) Oh ho ho! The luscious Captain Leela. This is turning into one very sex-ay struggle for the future of the human race!"
2595,LEELA,"Thanks, but I'm not technically human."
2596,ZAPP,"Right, right. Nobody destroy Leela either."
2597,ZAPP,"The key to victory is discipline, and that means a well-made bed. You will practise until you can make your bed in your sleep."
2598,FRY,You mean while I'm sleeping in it?
2599,ZAPP,"You won't have time for sleeping, soldier. Not with all the bed-making you'll be doing."
2600,ZAPP,"The alien mothership is in orbit here. If we can hit that bullseye the rest of the dominoes will fall like a house of cards. Checkmate.  Now, like all great plans, my strategy is so simple an idiot could have devised it. On my command all ships will line up and file directly into the alien death cannons, clogging them with wreckage."
2601,FRY,W-Wouldn't it make more sense to send the robots in first a--
2602,BENDER,"Sir, I volunteer for a suicide mission. Aw, cut it out!"
2603,ZAPP,"You're a brave robot, son. But when I'm in command every mission's a suicide mission. Which reminds me.  Leela, perhaps before we head into battle you'd like to make love to me, in case one of us doesn't come back."
2604,LEELA,"Maybe we should wait 'til afterwards, in case neither of us comes back."
2605,ZAPP,Here's hoping.
2606,FRY,"I'm gonna be a science-fiction hero, just like Uhura, or Captain Janeway, or Xena!"
2607,LEELA,"Fry, this isn't TV, it's real life. Can't you tell the difference?"
2608,FRY,"Sure, I just like TV better."
2609,LEELA,"Bender, damage report."
2610,BENDER,"The auxiliary power's out, and they spilled my cocktail."
2611,FRY,"Alright, scumwads. This one's for Bender's cocktail!"
2612,LEELA,We did it! We won!
2613,BENDER,"(sadly) Yeah, but it'll never bring back my martini.  (normal) Well, who wants a martini?"
2614,ZAPP,"Good work, everyone. The mothership is destroyed."
2615,ZAPP,What the hell is that thing?
2616,KIF,It appears to be the mothership.
2617,ZAPP,Then what did we just blow up?
2618,KIF,The Hubble Telescope.
2619,ZAPP,"(shouting) Stop exploding, you cowards!"
2620,LEELA,"This is hopeless.  If we're gonna get blown to bits, we might as well do it in the comfort of our own home."
2621,FARNSWORTH,"You'll be the captain, you'll be the delivery boy, and you'll be the alcoholic, foul-mouthed--  Oh, God, you're alive. I mean, thank God you're alive!  Sorry, check back in three days, a week at the most."
2622,LRRR,We want McNeal! Stop stalling!
2623,LINDA,And now a rebuttal from President McNeal.
2624,MCNEAL,The people of Earth remain united in my refusal to hand over myself. Total annihalation is a small price to pay compared with--
2625,ZAPP,(shouting) Here he is! Come and get him!
2626,LRRR,You are not McNeal.
2627,ZAPP,(simultaneously) Huh?
2628,MCNEAL,(simultaneously) Huh?
2629,ND-ND,You are not the one we want.
2630,MCNEAL,"Oh, thank you. Thank you, glorious masters! I--"
2631,LRRR,Give us McNeal!
2632,ZAPP,That was McNeal.
2633,ND-ND,"No, McNeal: The single female lawyer."
2634,LRRR,She wears miniskirts and is promiscuous.
2635,ZAPP,(sexfully) Really?
2636,FRY,Miniskirts? That sounds familiar.
2637,LRRR,Surely you know McNeal. She is an unmarried human female struggling to succeed in a human male's world.
2638,ZAPP,Maybe that's just her excuse for being incompetent.
2639,LRRR,(shouting) Silence! (talking) We will accept no more decoys.  This is the McNeal.
2640,FRY,"Wait, I know her."
2641,LEELA,"You do not, you big fat liar. You don't know anyone. All you do is watch TV."
2642,FRY,"That's where I know her from. She's Jenny McNeal. She was a character on a TV show back in the 20th century, Single Female Lawyer."
2643,BENDER,"Well if they're hoping to see a TV show that hasn't existed for a thousand years, pfft, they are royally boned."
2644,LRRR,"We will raise your planet's temperature by one million degrees a day, for five days, unless we see McNeal at 9pm tomorrow -- 8 central!"
2645,FARNSWORTH,(disappointed) I'm beginning to think there'll be no forced mating at all.
2646,LEELA,They're going to destroy the entire Earth if they don't see some stupid TV show about some bimbo lawyer?
2647,FRY,It's crazy! How could they even know about a show from a thousand years ago?
2648,FARNSWORTH,"Well, Omicron Persei 8 is about a thousand light years away. So the electro-magnetic waves would just recently have gotten there. You see--"
2649,FRY,Magic. Got it.
2650,AMY,Check this out: Back in 1999 the season finale of Single Female Lawyer was interrupted by technical problems. Apparently some zidiot spilled Coke on the transmitter.
2651,FRY,Beer -- I would think.
2652,BENDER,They must just wanna see that episode. Let's find a tape and give it to 'em.
2653,AMY,There aren't any copies left.
2654,FARNSWORTH,"No, there wouldn't be. Most videotapes from that era were damaged in 2443 during the Second Coming of Jesus."
2655,FRY,"Y'know, I saw the first 30 seconds of that episode. If I could make up an ending, maybe we could act it out ourselves."
2656,ZOIDBERG,I could make the costumes.
2657,FARNSWORTH,I have an old five-megawatt broadcasting tower in the attic.
2658,BENDER,"(dramatically) And I, I could be an acting coach!"
2659,FRY,Let's put on a show.
2660,FRY,"OK, Leela, you'll be starring as Jenny--"
2661,LEELA,"Uh-uh, forget it. A: I'm camera shy, and B: I get tongue tied in front of an audience armed with death rays."
2662,AMY,"Plus, you don't really have the thighs for a miniskirt."
2663,LEELA,Gimme the script.
2664,FRY,"Places, everyone."
2665,AMY,OK ... all set!
2666,FRY,Lights!  Camera one!  Camera two!  Camera three!
2667,LRRR,"Prepare the water cooler, that we may gather around it later and discuss things."
2668,BENDER,(singing) ...And being self-reliant.
2669,FARNSWORTH,"Uh, (reading) Jenny McNeal, you are charged with jury-tampering in last week's case ...  ... on account of your hot, naked affair with the foreman. How do you plead?"
2670,LEELA,"Your Honour, I move for a mistrial, on the grounds that I'm also having a hot, naked affair with the foreman of this jury."
2671,HERMES,(sexfully) I'll see you during the recess!
2672,LRRR,If McNeal wishes to be taken seriously why does she not simply tear the judge's head off?
2673,ND-ND,"It is true what they say; ""Women are from Omicron Persei 7, men are from Omicron Persei 9""."
2674,FARNSWORTH,"(reading) Your witness, Prosecutor Ramirez."
2675,ZOIDBERG,"Gracias.  Single Female Lawyer, where were you on the night of August 23rd?"
2676,LEELA,Sleeping with you.
2677,ZOIDBERG,Aha!
2678,LEELA,"Uh, g-- uh, getting back to the, uh, matter, uh-uh, if it please the court ... (whispering) Fry, there's nothing else here. You only wrote two pages of dialogue."
2679,FRY,"Well, it took an hour to write. I thought it would take an hour to read."
2680,LEELA,What are we supposed to do now?
2681,FRY,"I don't know, I don't know. Just say anything. As long as it's compelling, mesmerising, a tour de force."
2682,LEELA,Uh...
2683,FARNSWORTH,"(reading) What say you, Single Female Lawyer?"
2684,LEELA,"I say ... I'm giving up the law.  And I'm giving up being single. Your Honour, will you marry me?"
2685,FRY,"No, no! Go to commercial!"
2686,BENDER,We'll be back after this word from Crazy Bender's Discount Stereo.
2687,FRY,Married? Jenny can't get married.
2688,LEELA,"Why not? It's clever, it's unexpected."
2689,FRY,"But that's not why people watch TV. Clever things make people feel stupid, and unexpected things make them feel scared."
2690,LRRR [ON TV],"Attention, McNeal. Your unexpected marriage plan scares us. You stole our hearts as a single female lawyer, and so shall you remain -- or else!"
2691,FRY,You see? TV audiences don't want anything original. They wanna see the same thing they've seen a thousand times before.
2692,BENDER,"(à la Arnold Jackson) Whatchoo talkin' 'bout, Fry?"
2693,FRY,"Trust me on this. While other people were out living their lives, I wasted mine watching TV, because deep down I knew it might one day help me save the world. Plus, I would have lost my Workman's Comp if I hadd gone outside. Now just read these cue cards."
2694,FRY,And action!
2695,FARNSWORTH,"(reading) Miss McNeal, I'm afraid I must decline your offer of marriage. For, you see, I'm dying. Cough, then fall over dead."
2696,ZOIDBERG,"(reading; unmoved) My God, he's dead."
2697,LEELA,(reading) I will now make my closing statement. With my fiancé deceased ... ... I hereby return to my single female lawyer career. No matter what any man says.
2698,HERMES,We find the defendant vulnerable yet spunky!
2699,ZOIDBERG,(cheering) Hooray!
2700,AMY,(cheering) Hooray!
2701,FRY,And ... cut!
2702,BENDER,"(singing) Single Female Lawyer,"
2703,LRRR [ON TV],"Attention, McNeal. We are reasonably satisfied with the events we have seen. Overall I would rate it a C+, OK, not great.  As a result, we will not destroy your planet. But neither will we provide you with our recipe for immortality."
2704,FRY,"Way to overact ,Zoidberg!"
2705,LRRR [ON TV],"And now we must return to our planet, to catch the end of a thousand-year-old Leno monologue."
2706,BENDER,"You did it, Fry!"
2707,FRY,"Yep.  It was just a matter of knowing the secret of all TV shows; At the end of the episode, everything's always right back to normal."
2708,THE END,
2709,"""FRY AND THE SLURM FACTORY""",
2710,CALCULON,"Honey unit, I'm home.  Monique!"
2711,MONIQUE,Calculon!
2712,CALCULON,"Oh, how I wish I could believe that. You may be my evil half-brother, but there's no law against murdering the other half."
2713,ANNOUNCER #1,All My Circuits will be right back after this word from...
2714,ANNOUNCER #2,... Slurm! It's highly addictive!
2715,BABE,Look! It's Slurms MacKenzie!
2716,DIXIE,He's the original party worm!
2717,SLURMS,Whimmy-wham-wham-wazzle! Let's party!
2718,BENDER,Look at that worm go. Who says there are no more heroes?
2719,SLURMS,"Hey, dudes, you can win a chance to party with me, Slurms MacKenzie, at the Slurm bottling plant on planet Wormulon!"
2720,ANNOUNCER #2,Just look for the winning bottle-cap inside specially-marked cans of Slurm.
2721,BABE,I won!
2722,SLURM ANNOUNCER #2,No purchase necessary unless you wish to enter the contest. Odds of winning mathematically insignificant.
2723,FRY,I like those odds.  Rats. Just another tooth.  Aah!
2724,FRY,I gotta find that golden bottle-cap.
2725,LEELA,I've never seen anyone so addicted to Slurm.
2726,FRY,This is nothing. Back in high school I used to drink a hundred cans of cola a week. Right up until my third heart attack.
2727,LEELA,"Bender, what's wrong?"
2728,BENDER,I'm sick.
2729,LEELA,You poor baby. Let me check if you have a fever.  Ow!
2730,FARNSWORTH,"According to Bender's temperature gauge, which I suggest you use next time, Leela, he's running a fever of ... 900 degrees."
2731,HERMES,"Bender, mon, lie yourself down.  You're payin' for that!"
2732,ZOIDBERG,"I'll have a look, but I remind you, I'm an expert on humans not robots."
2733,FRY,"I'm not Bender, I'm Fry."
2734,ZOIDBERG,Really? I though you were the robot.
2735,FRY,Nope. Human.
2736,ZOIDBERG,"Alright, alright, spare me your life story.  Now what seems to be the trouble?"
2737,BENDER,My tummy hurts and I've been having this burning electrical discharge.
2738,ZOIDBERG,"Hmm. Don't worry, you'll be fine.  (muttering) Oh boy. (quietly) I didn't have the heart to tell him: It's fin fungus. He'll be floating upside-down by morning."
2739,AMY,"You should try homeopathic medicine, Bender. Take some zinc."
2740,BENDER,I'm 40% zinc.
2741,AMY,Then take some Echinaea or a St. John's wort.
2742,FARNSWORTH,Or a big fat placebo. It's all the same crap.
2743,LEELA,"Hey, what's rattling around in there?"
2744,FARNSWORTH,"It may well be the cause of Bender's illness. But more importantly, it's a flimsy pretext to try out my latest invention. To the laboratory!"
2745,FARNSWORTH,"I call this the F-ray. It's like an X-ray only it allows you to see through anything - even metal. Now, the neutrino beam it emits is a tad dangerous, so you'll all need protective goggles. You may feel a slight stinging sensation - all of you-- All of you!  Aha! There's the cause of your illness."
2746,AMY,"Hey, that's my watch!"
2747,BENDER,"I was wondering where I put that.  Hey, now I feel much better! Thanks, Professor. And, Amy, I'm sorry I took your watch."
2748,FARNSWORTH,"Well, I've got to go take this suit to the decontaminators. You two lock up the F-ray and for the love of God don't let it fall into the wrong hands."
2749,BENDER,What should we point it at first?
2750,FRY,I 'unno. Try it on me.  Ow! My sperm!
2751,BENDER,"Wow, neat! Mind if I try that again?"
2752,FRY,"Huh, didn't hurt that time."
2753,BENDER,"Whoa, mama! Hold still, sexy lady."
2754,FRY,What's wrong?
2755,BENDER,That's no lady!
2756,"""FEMBOT""","Damn chico, one more upgrade and I'll be more lady than you can handle! Why you so stupid, stupid?"
2757,BENDER,"Hey, bite my shiny metal ass!"
2758,"""FEMBOT""","You couldn't afford it, honey."
2759,FRY,"All this prolonged exposure to radiation is making me thirsty.  Ah, if only there was some way of knowing which can had the winning bottle-cap inside."
2760,BENDER,"Huh, w-what? I didn't hear you. I was too busy using this F-ray to look inside of things."
2761,FRY,"Wait a second. I'm getting an idea. N-No, false alarm. No. Yeah. No. Yeah. No. Wait. No. Yeah. Yeah. No ... no. Yes!"
2762,BENDER,"Ah, this thing stinks."
2763,FRY,"We checked 90,000 cans of Slurm and all we won was this junk.  I never wanna see another can of Slurm again. Man, am I thirsty."
2764,LEELA,"Fry, are you alright?"
2765,BENDER,"You did it, Fry! You found the winning bottle-cap! We won!"
2766,FRY,(wheezy) Hooray!
2767,LEELA,"Ooh, look at that!"
2768,BENDER,Hey!
2769,GLURMO,"Welcome to the planet Wormulon. I'm Glurmo, your golly-rific guide to the splend-tacular Slurm factory."
2770,FRY,Uh-huh. Can we have our free Slurm now?
2771,GLURMO,You'll have all the Slurm you can drink later on when you're partying with my good friend Slurms MacKenzie.
2772,SLURMS,"Alright! Whimmy-wham-wham-wazzle! Lay some skin on me, dudes!"
2773,BENDER,"Wow! The original party worm!  Are you ready to get down, get funky with us?"
2774,GLURMO,"He'd better be, that's what we pay him for. Right, Slurms?"
2775,SLURMS,Right!
2776,GLURMO,"In fact, Slurms has to party all night, every night - or he's fired!"
2777,SLURMS,(tired) Rock on!
2778,GLURMO,"But before the party, you're all in for a fun-derful treat: A VIP tour of the Slurm factory!"
2779,SLURMS,"Enjoy the tour, dudes!  I'm gonna go lie down."
2780,GLURMO,"Welcome, my friends, to the wondrous world of whimsy that we like to call ""Slurms Centralised Industrial Fabrication Unit""."
2781,FARNSWORTH,"Oh, my!"
2782,BENDER,Look! Flowers! And a boat!
2783,FARNSWORTH,Who are those horrible orange creatures over there?
2784,GLURMO,Why those are the Grunka Lunkas. They work here in the Slurm factory.
2785,FARNSWORTH,Tell them I hate them.
2786,GLURMO,"As we sail down the river of Slurm you'll see our mix-ologists at work.  They take 900 of the finest ingredients, add a touch of child-like delight and mix it all with glacial spring water from our glacial spring water generator. Then, last of all, we add the secret ingredient that makes Slurm so deliciously addictive."
2787,FRY,"So, what's the secret ingredient?"
2788,GLURMO,It's whatever your imagination wants it to be.
2789,FRY,Oh. But what is it really?
2790,GLURMO,"(sternly) That's not for you to know. (normal) Now, over here the Grunka Lunkas are inducing Wumpus berries to release their flavour, using sensual massage."
2791,BENDER,"(whispering) Psst, those berries. Those are the secret ingredient, right?"
2792,GLURMO,No.
2793,BENDER,You positive?
2794,GLURMO,Yes.
2795,BENDER,I'm just asking cause they look kind of secret.
2796,GLURMO,Enough! There will be no further questions.
2797,FRY,Why?
2798,LEELA,"Hey, look! The disgusting little men are starting to sing."
2799,GRUNKA LUNKAS,"(singing) Grunka Lunka dunkity-do,"
2800,GRUNKA LUNKA #1,(singing) Asking questions in school is a great way to learn ...
2801,GRUNKA LUNKA #2,(singing) ... If you try that stuff here you might get your legs broke.
2802,GRUNKA LUNKA #1,(singing) We once found a dead guy face down in the Slurm ...
2803,GRUNKA LUNKA #2,(singing) ... It could easily happen again to you folks.
2804,GRUNKA LUNKAS,"(singing) So keep you head down,"
2805,GLERMO,"(shouting) Hey, I don't pay you to sing! You just used up today's bathroom break!"
2806,GRUNKA LUNKA #2,Hard ass.
2807,GLURMO,I heard that!
2808,GLURMO,"Now on your right, you'll see the Slurm Master checking the Slurm for colour and bouquet."
2809,FRY,So thirsty.
2810,GLURMO,"Then he tastes it. He tastes it and tastes it, then tastes it some more."
2811,FRY,"Uh, could I have some Slurm, please?"
2812,GLURMO,No food or drink allowed on the tour. You'll have to wait until you're partying with Slurms MacKenzie.
2813,FRY,When will that be?
2814,GLURMO,Soon enough.
2815,FRY,That's not soon enough.
2816,LEELA,"Hey, what's behind that door?"
2817,GLURMO,Nothing.
2818,LEELA,Is it the secret ingredient?
2819,GRUNKA LUNKAS,"(singing) Grunka Lunka dunkity dingredient,"
2820,BENDER,"OK, OK, we get the point."
2821,LEELA,I was just curious because of the armed guards.
2822,GRUNKA LUNKAS,(singing) Grunka Lunka dunkity darmed guards--
2823,BENDER,(shouting) Shut the hell up!
2824,HERMES,So you're telling me I could fire my whole staff and hire Grunka Lunkas at half the cost?
2825,GLURMO,That's right. They think they have a good union but they don't. (whispering) They're basically slaves.
2826,LEELA,What are you doing?
2827,FRY,I'm dying of thirst. Grab my feet and dunk my head in so I can drink.
2828,LEELA,No. That's moronic.
2829,FRY,Fine. I'll let go and swim around in the Slurm and drink as much as I want. Help! I can't swim!
2830,LEELA,"Bender, why did you jump in?"
2831,BENDER,Everybody was doing it. I just wanted to be popular.
2832,BENDER,Ow!
2833,LEELA,Where are we?
2834,BENDER,And why is the Slurm pouring into this sewer?
2835,FRY,This isn't Slurm at all!
2836,LEELA,Something's rotten on the planet Wormulon. Look at this.
2837,LEELA,This all must have something to do with the secret ingredient.
2838,FRY,My God. What if the secret ingredient ... is people?
2839,LEELA,No. There's already a soda like that: Soylent Cola.
2840,FRY,Oh. How is it?
2841,LEELA,It varies from person to person.
2842,FARNSWORTH,Ooh!
2843,ZOIDBERG,Do you have any that aren't so tight around the thorax?
2844,GLURMO,"Yes, over in-- Say, weren't there more people in your group at the start of the tour?"
2845,AMY,"Hey, yeah. Fry, Leela and Bender are missing."
2846,GLURMO,If you'll excuse me.
2847,LEELA,(whispering) Quick.
2848,FRY,"Look! Slurm! Finally!  Oh, yeah! I'm never going 12 minutes without a Slurm again."
2849,LEELA,It's the end of the line. This must be where they put in the secret ingredient.
2850,FRY,"Well, whatever it is, it's even better fresh.  Mmm, still warm."
2851,FRY,Ew!
2852,LEELA,Blech!
2853,BENDER,"Oh, Lordy!"
2854,LEELA,Fry!  Fry!
2855,FRY,That's the secret ingredient of Slurm?
2856,LEELA,That's the only ingredient of Slurm.
2857,FRY,Ew!
2858,BENDER,"I'll save us!  Oh, that feels good!"
2859,FRY,"Thanks, Bender!"
2860,LEELA,The exit! We made it.
2861,BENDER,"Uh, your majesty, I brought the prisoners."
2862,GLURMO,"Well, my curious friends, you learned the secret of Slurm. That concludes the portion of the tour where you stay alive."
2863,LEELA,"You wish, you slimy worm! Heyya!"
2864,SLURM QUEEN,"Good work, Glurmo. You have pleased your queen."
2865,SMALL GLURMO #2,"Thank you, your majesty."
2866,SMALL GLURMO #1,"Thanks, ma'am."
2867,LEELA,How can you trick people into drinking something that comes out of your behind? It's disgusting.
2868,SLURM QUEEN,Is it? Honey comes from a bee's behind. Milk comes from a cow's behind. And have you ever used toothpaste?
2869,FRY,Who's behind does that come from?
2870,SLURM QUEEN,You don't wanna know.
2871,BENDER,"Look, we just came to party with Slurms MacKenzie. By the way, when is that scheduled?"
2872,SLURM QUEEN,(shouting) Never!  To the torture cave!
2873,SLURM QUEEN,"You, my metal friend, will have the honour of becoming 174 Slurm cans."
2874,BENDER,"Ah, this trip is turning into a big letdown."
2875,SLURM QUEEN,"As for you, you will be submerged in Royal Slurm which, in a matter of minutes, will transform you into a Slurm Queen like myself."
2876,SMALL GLURMO #1,"But, your highness, she's a commoner. Her Slurm will taste foul."
2877,SLURM QUEEN,"Yes! Which is why we'll market it as New Slurm. Then, when everyone hates it, we'll bring back Slurm Classic, and make billions!"
2878,FRY,What about me?
2879,SLURM QUEEN,You are free to go ...
2880,FRY,Yes!
2881,SLURM QUEEN,"... if you can resist this concentrated super Slurm!  It's so delicious, you'll eat until you explode! Oh, which reminds me, put a tarp over that sofa, will you? Bon appétit!"
2882,FRY,Mmm!
2883,SLURM QUEEN,"Farewell! Oh, and congratulations again on winning the contest."
2884,LEELA,"Fry, untie us, quick!"
2885,FRY,Here I come.  Let me just-- One more taste.
2886,LEELA,You pig. Stop stuffing your craw and save us.
2887,BENDER,I can't see what's happening. Are we boned?
2888,LEELA,"Yeah, we're boned."
2889,FRY,I can't stop eating this delicious ooze. But I'm not gonna let you die.
2890,LEELA,Hurry!
2891,BENDER,What's happening?  Just in time!
2892,FRY,(screaming) Nooo!  (talking) I could fit if I didn't have these damn arms!
2893,LEELA,We're close to the exit. I can smell those filthy orange guys.
2894,SLURMS,Stop right there!
2895,BENDER,Slurms MacKenzie?
2896,SLURMS,Shh! I want you to take me with you.
2897,FRY,Say what?
2898,SLURMS,I'm partied out. All I want is to stay home and rent videos and watch them with a few friends. Is that so much to ask?
2899,BENDER,Forget it pal.  It says on this bottle-cap you have to party with us.
2900,SLURMS,"Alright, when we get to Earth. But please don't invite too many people, I wanna keep it small."
2901,BENDER,"No can do, Slurms!"
2902,SLURMS,This way!
2903,LEELA,She's gaining on us.
2904,SLURMS,"Go on without me, I'll hold her off."
2905,FRY,But she'll crush you like a worm ... crushing a smaller worm.
2906,SLURMS,It's alright. I'm so tired of partying. So very tired.  I'll save you the only way I know how: By partying!  Babes.
2907,DIXIE,"Yes, Mr. MacKenzie?"
2908,SLURMS,"You've served me well these 40 years, but this time I've got to party alone."
2909,BABE,But--
2910,SLURMS,There'll be other parties for you. Now go. Go!
2911,BENDER,"Party on, Slurms!"
2912,SLURMS,"Party on, contest winners. Party on."
2913,SLURM QUEEN,No! We're ruined! They know our disgusting secret!
2914,FARNSWORTH,"Commissioner, my crew has made a horrific discovery: It seems that Slurm is produced in a colossal worm hiney!"
2915,COMMISSIONER,"Hmm, ""hiney"", you say? Why, with your testimony we'll finally be able to outlaw this insidious Slurm."
2916,FRY,"Outlaw Slurm?  Uh, don't pay any attention to him sir ..."
2917,FRY,... Grandpa's making up crazy stories again.
2918,FARNSWORTH,"I'm not your grandpa, you're my uncle! From the year 2000!"
2919,COMMISSIONER,"OK, grandpa, we'll take care of the ""bad worms,"" don't you worry."
2920,FRY,"Ah, I just wish Slurms MacKenzie were here to enjoy this with me."
2921,BENDER,"Yeah, that Slurms sure loved to party. Whattya say we all party one last time for him?"
2922,LEELA,For Slurms!
2923,AMY,(simultaneously) For Slurms!
2924,BENDER,(simultaneously) For Slurms!
2925,FARNSWORTH,(simultaneously) For Slurms!
2926,FRY,(simultaneously) For Slurms!
2927,ZOIDBERG,(simultaneously) Whammy-wazzle!
2928,BENDER,"Hey, that's not that bad."
2929,FRY,Mmm!
2930,THE END,
2931,"""I SECOND THAT EMOTION""",
2932,ANNOUNCER,(voice-over) Futurama is brought to you by ...  ... Glagnar's Human Rinds. It's a buncha muncha cruncha human!
2933,LEELA,Aww! Somebody likes snouts.
2934,FRY,Is it me?
2935,BENDER,"(shouting) Ow, my head! My precious head!  (talking) Stupid can opener. You killed my father and now you've come back for me!"
2936,FRY,"You alright, Bender?"
2937,BENDER,"Yeah, I guess so. But I don't see why we keep this ticking time-bomb around just for that dumb animal."
2938,LEELA,"Don't yell at Nibbler like that.  You hurt his feelings. Come on, pet him and make up."
2939,BENDER,No.
2940,LEELA,I said pet him.
2941,BENDER,I'll pet him. I'll pet him with both hands!  Ow! My ass! Get off!
2942,LEELA,Are you alright?
2943,BENDER,"Ah, it's nothing a lawsuit won't cure."
2944,LEELA,"Not you.  Aww, poor baby chipped a fang."
2945,BENDER,"Hey, I got a busted ass here, I don't see anyone kissing it."
2946,ZOIDBERG,"(reluctant) Alright, I'm coming."
2947,JEFFERY,"Remember, Rover gets the pill and Pepper gets the suppository.  Next."
2948,JEFFERY,"It's just a simple broken fang, nothing serious."
2949,BENDER,"What's that you say there, doctor? You're gonna have to put him down?"
2950,JEFFERY,No-- what? Huh?
2951,BENDER,Terrible shame that. Shall I do the honours?
2952,LEELA,No!
2953,BENDER,You about done?
2954,LEELA,Next time I'm keeping it.
2955,JEFFERY,"OK, well I believe I have a replacement fang for your pet in the next room. The jaguar didn't wanna cooperate but luckily he knocked one of my teeth out. Now then."
2956,FRY,"Hey, what are these rings in Nibbler's fang?"
2957,JEFFERY,"Um, I'm still a little woozy from a gazelle kick this morning but if he's anything like the common tree, the rings might indicate his age."
2958,FRY,"Yeah, well, good luck. It'd take some kind of genius to count all those rings."
2959,JEFFERY,He's five.
2960,FARNSWORTH,"Happy birthday, young Nibbler."
2961,LEELA,"Aww, look how cuddly he looks in his new cape!"
2962,BENDER,(sarcastic) I'd be cuddly too if someone gave me a new cape.
2963,FRY,Who's playing pin the tail on the moon maggot?
2964,BENDER,"Ooh, me! Everyone watch how good I am. And the crowd goes wild! What prize do I get? Cash?"
2965,AMY,"Hey, look at Nibbler!"
2966,HERMES,"Aww, he's holding a spoon."
2967,ZOIDBERG,He's so talented!
2968,BENDER,You call that talent? Gather round old Bender and get ready for the show of a lifetime.  Ta-da!
2969,HERMES,Now he's wearing a hat!
2970,LEELA,"Come on, let's all sing Happy Birthday!"
2971,ALL,(singing) What day is today?
2972,FRY,(singing) ... and you smell like one too!
2973,BENDER,"Hey, what about this?"
2974,LEELA,"Bender, I thought you were supposed to be cooking for this party."
2975,BENDER,"Fine, we'll have rack of Nibbler."
2976,LEELA,"Just make a simple cake. And this time, if someone's going to jump out of it, make sure you put them in after you cook it."
2977,BENDER,"So it's a cake you want, is it? I'll make you a cake you'll never forget."
2978,BENDER,"That'll take care of those annoying rats.  Now, to bake a cake so delicious they'll have no choice but to love and worship me."
2979,BENDER,There! This'll teach those filthy bastards who's lovable. Now all I have to do is spell check it and it's ready for my admiring public.  No! Get away from there!  That's it.
2980,BENDER,Happy birthday!
2981,LEELA,"Bender, what's going--  (crying) No!"
2982,BENDER,Hey! Can't you see I'm using the toilet?
2983,AMY,Bender! How could you flush Nibbler down the toilet?
2984,BENDER,"Well, step one, I had to lift the seat. That was the first little annoyance. Am I right, men?"
2985,LEELA,(crying) Aren't you upset at all? How would you feel if I flushed Fry down the toilet?
2986,BENDER,Only one way to find out.
2987,LEELA,(crying) You have no sympathy for anyone else's feelings.
2988,BENDER,Of course I do. Right now I feel sorry for you.
2989,LEELA,You do?
2990,BENDER,"Yeah. I mean, one cantaloupe-sized bloodshot eye? You ain't winning no beauty pageants, lady."
2991,FARNSWORTH,"And so we say goodbye to our beloved pet Nibbler, who's gone to a place where I too hope one day to go: The toilet."
2992,LEELA,(crying) I wouldn't feel so bad if Bender just understood the pain he caused me.
2993,CALCULON,"Give it to me straight, doctor -- don't sugarcoat it."
2994,DOCTORBOT,Very well. Your entire family died when a plane piloted by your fiancée crashed into your uninsured home. And you have inoperable cancer.
2995,BENDER,"Bet you weren't expecting that one, Calculon!"
2996,AMY,It's like he doesn't understand simple humanoid emotion.
2997,LEELA,I wish just once Bender could feel exactly what I feel.
2998,FARNSWORTH,"Actually, through the miracle of science, that can be arranged."
2999,FRY,Uh-oh. Is this gonna be another crazy experiment that crosses a line Man was not meant to cross?
3000,LINDA,"The official death toll in that tragic rocket crash has now been raised to 54,000."
3001,BENDER,"Hey, what the hell are you doing with my head?"
3002,FARNSWORTH,I need to tinker in it.
3003,BENDER,Why don't you just use a potted plant like Fry?
3004,FARNSWORTH,"Quiet, you. I'm installing an empathy chip."
3005,FRY,And that'll allow Bender to feel other people's emotions?
3006,FARNSWORTH,"Yes. If by ""allow"" you mean ""force""."
3007,BENDER,Ooh! Ow! Son of a-- Careful with that! Ow ...
3008,FARNSWORTH,"Oh dear, oh my. I got it. Once more."
3009,BENDER,... Ow! Professor!
3010,FARNSWORTH,Steady now.
3011,BENDER,Ow!
3012,FARNSWORTH,There we go.  Now I'll simply tune it to Leela's emotional frequency.
3013,BENDER,"My God, I'm overcome with ... feelings. I'm experiencing a powerful yearning to ... to cram my gullet full of mackerel heads."
3014,ZOIDBERG,"That's me, baby!"
3015,FARNSWORTH,Hmm.
3016,BENDER,"Now I'm worried that I'm not as smart as Leela, but at the same time I feel relieved that I'm cuter than her."
3017,AMY,Uh ... that's me.
3018,FRY,(whispering) Thanks for covering.
3019,BENDER,This time I miss Nibbler and I'm feeling nosy and opinionated.
3020,AMY,Bingo!
3021,HERMES,That's Leela!
3022,LEELA,"Thank you, Professor. I'm happy that Bender can finally feel my pain."
3023,BENDER,Happy. I like this feeling. Just don't revert to your usual mopey self.
3024,LEELA,I'm not mopey. You shut up!
3025,BENDER,"Anger, huh? How dare you make me feel anger, you one-eyed jerk with a dead pet!"
3026,LEELA,"Thanks for taking me out, Amy. I feel slightly less miserable already."
3027,AMY,"Hey, you know what'd cheer you up? You should get a puppy."
3028,LEELA,A puppy? Nibbler loved to eat puppies.
3029,FRY,What's your problem?
3030,BENDER,(crying) I miss Nibbler.
3031,FRY,You do?
3032,BENDER,"Hell, no! It's Leela's stupid feelings. Why can't she just drink herself happy like a normal person?"
3033,BENDER,"Uh-oh, jealousy.  (shouting) You think you're so hot!"
3034,FRY,What?
3035,BENDER,The only reason you get all the guys is because you dress like a tramp!
3036,FRY,(crying) They're just responding to my personality.
3037,AMY,"Um, Leela? Armando and I are going to the back seat of his car for coffee. You gonna be alright here by yourself?"
3038,LEELA,(theatrical happiness) Sure. I'm having a great time -- really. You two go enjoy yourselves.
3039,BENDER,(crying) I'm so lonely. I'm gonna go eat a bucket of ice cream.  (crying) A bucket of ...
3040,FRY,(shouting) The spoon's in the foot powder.
3041,BENDER,"I'm at the end of my rope. I can't live another minute without poor, sweet Nibbler."
3042,FRY,"Too bad he wasn't an alligator. Y'know, when you flush those things they stay alive in the sewers."
3043,BENDER,Really?
3044,FRY,Yep. My friend's cousin's caseworker saw one once. It's a widely-believed fact.
3045,BENDER,"Hmm, sewers.  Thinking, thinking, thinking."
3046,BENDER,"Hang on, Nibbler. Uncle Bender's coming to save you.  Damn, it's too small. What did those human design this for anyway?  Aha! Bender, one; toilet, zero! See you on the other side!"
3047,FRY,Bender? Bender?!
3048,FRY,Have you seen my sombrero?
3049,LEELA,Now he's flushed himself down the toilet? Who's he gonna flush next?
3050,FRY,"Hey, it's your fault. He only flushed himself because your emotions made him feel bad."
3051,LEELA,You're right. I feel terrible.
3052,FRY,"Oh, great, now you're making him feel worse!"
3053,LEELA,I guess we'd better go down into the sewers and look for him.
3054,AMY,Are you crazy? There's mutants down there! They'll eat you alive.
3055,ZOIDBERG,They're hideous!
3056,LEELA,There's no such thing as mutants. That's a ridiculous urban myth.
3057,FARNSWORTH,"Oh, don't be so sure. Many scientists believe humans really could mutate down there. Uh, due to exposure to toxic waste and radioactive runoff and good old American faeces."
3058,FRY,God bless America.
3059,FRY,"Phew! Uh, ladies first."
3060,FRY,"Oh, and the aftertaste!"
3061,LEELA,What is it?
3062,FRY,I burned my finger.
3063,LEELA,"OK, check the guidebook."
3064,FRY,"Looks like we're under Park Avenue. Ooh, ritzy! Just think: All this was probably once a charity luncheon for the Met."
3065,LEELA,"Wait, what's that?"
3066,BENDER,I never should have thrown out the manual.
3067,LEELA,"Bender, you didn't have to come down here."
3068,BENDER,I know. But I just missed Nibbler so much.
3069,LEELA,(crying) He was so cute.
3070,BENDER,(crying) He was so sweet.
3071,FRY,Eck! This emotional display is making me nauseous.  Or maybe it's whatever that is.
3072,LEELA,(shouting) Nibbler?
3073,BENDER,(shouting) Nibbler?
3074,LEELA,"It's no use. We'd better turn back. Which way, Fry?"
3075,FRY,"Hmm. According to this map, the only way out is through ... that pipe.  Don't worry. It gets wider after about a mile."
3076,LEELA,(simultaneously) Idiot.
3077,BENDER,(simultaneously) Idiot.
3078,FRY,"OK, OK, nevermind. I'll just ask those people for directions."
3079,LEELA,(shouting) Mutants!
3080,LEELA,Mutants! They're real!
3081,FRY,I'll take care of this!  Back! Back!
3082,VYOLET,"Thanks, handsome."
3083,DWAYNE,"Please, do not be frightened, we're harmless."
3084,RAOUL,I have three arms.
3085,DWAYNE,"I said ""harmless"" not ""armless""."
3086,VYOLET,Lay off him. You know he's only got one ear.
3087,FRY,"Hey, aren't you supposed to be eating our brains? You're mutants."
3088,DWAYNE,Mutants? Perhaps it is you who are the mutants.
3089,VYOLET,"Please, Dwayne, have you looked in a mirror lately?"
3090,RAOUL,"Welcome to our village. It may not be Paris but it has a certain quaint charm that I, for one, wouldn't trade for the world."
3091,BENDER,"You guys realise you live in a sewer, right?"
3092,DWAYNE,Perhaps. But perhaps your civilisation is merely the sewer of an even greater society above you.
3093,LEELA,"No, we're on the top."
3094,FRY,Daylight and everything.
3095,VYOLET,It must be wonderful.
3096,BENDER,Eh.
3097,LEELA,"Listen. We actually came down here to find our pet, Nibbler. He got flushed down the toilet."
3098,RAOUL,Well if he got flushed down the toilet he probably came through here. Everything always does. Follow me.  All that is ours was once flushed down your toilets. Over there is our aquarium.  This is our library.
3099,BENDER,Nothing but crumpled porno and Ayn Rand.
3100,RAOUL,And over here is our church.
3101,FRY,Wow. You guys worship an unexploded nuclear bomb?
3102,VYOLET,"Yeah, but nobody's that observant. It's mainly a Christmas and Easter thing."
3103,LEELA,(shouting) Nibbler?
3104,BENDER,"(shouting) Come to Daddy, sweetie-ookums."
3105,FRY,"So, is it true that alligators flushed down the toilet survive down here?"
3106,VYOLET,No. That's just an urban legend.
3107,BENDER,Then what are those?
3108,VYOLET,Crocodiles.
3109,RAOUL,"We keep them as pets. Then, when they grow too large, we flush them down into the sub-sewer."
3110,DWAYNE,Some say there's a freakish race of sub-mutants down there.
3111,VYOLET,"Please, that's just a sub-urban legend."
3112,DWAYNE,Oh? Then I suppose you also don't believe in ...  ... El Chupanibre.
3113,LEELA,El Chupanibre? What's that?
3114,DWAYNE,"Gather round, children, for the legend of El Chupanibre."
3115,VYOLET,Crocodile.
3116,DWAYNE,Whatever.
3117,LEELA,Wait. Our pet Nibbler loves fresh crocodile. It's his favourite treat. He must be El Chupanibre.
3118,BENDER,"Hey, yeah!"
3119,RAOUL,You unleashed the dreaded El Chupanibre upon us? Then you are our sworn enemies.
3120,LEELA,You don't understand. He would never hurt people. Let us help you capture him.
3121,DWAYNE,"Impossible. If the legend is true, our only hope is to offer him a snack-rifice."
3122,RAOUL,Yes. An unspoiled virgin.
3123,LEELA,I volunteer.
3124,VYOLET,"Nice try, Leela, but we've all seen Zapp Brannigan's webpage."
3125,BENDER,"Oh, I made myself feel bad."
3126,RAOUL,"She'll have to do. Chain her to the post!  And rip her shirt a little. Behold. When El Chupanibre comes for the, uh, ""virgin"", he will be snared by this rope trap."
3127,DWAYNE,(quietly) Shh. El Chupanibre comes soon. It is nightfall.
3128,LEELA,Nightfall? How can you tell down here?
3129,DWAYNE,The tide is coming in.
3130,VYLOET,"Quiet, the beast approaches."
3131,BENDER,"Nibbler! Aw, come here precious!  Look everyone, it's El Chupanibre."
3132,DWAYNE,That's not El Chupanibre.
3133,BENDER,Say what?
3134,DWAYNE,That's El Chupanibre.
3135,FRY,I'll take care of this.
3136,LEELA,"Bender, do something."
3137,BENDER,I'm too scared.
3138,FRY,"Leela, your scaredness is being transmitted straight to Bender. If you care about Nibbler, stop caring about him!"
3139,LEELA,I can't. I love every living creature.
3140,FRY,Even me?
3141,LEELA,As a friend.
3142,FRY,Damn.
3143,BENDER,"Listen to me, Leela: I'm an expert at not caring. The secret is to stop giving a rat's ass about anyone else and start thinking of the things that you want, that you deserve, that the world owes you."
3144,LEELA,"Well, I could use a new tank top."
3145,BENDER,Bigger! Bigger!
3146,LEELA,A fashionable tank top. And designer boots ... encrusted with jewels.
3147,BENDER,"Don't stop now, you'll need some pants to go with that outfit."
3148,LEELA,Yeah. And I could afford it all if I didn't have to feed that stupid Nibbler.
3149,BENDER,"Bender is back. I'll save you, Nibbler."
3150,FRY,Bender's gonna be killed!
3151,LEELA,You know what else I could use? A weekend at one of those fancy spas. And a Toblerone.
3152,FRY,(cheering) Yeah!
3153,LEELA,You did it!
3154,RAOUL,Let's have a tissue-tape parade!
3155,BENDER,No thanks.
3156,DWAYNE,"Gather round, children, to hear the legend of Bender."
3157,FARNSWORTH,That was a disgusting story.
3158,LEELA,"And it's all thanks to Bender. I love you, Bender."
3159,BENDER,I love you too.  Get that stupid chip out of me before I kill myself!
3160,FARNSWORTH,"Bender, you won't believe this, but the empathy chip burned out. The emotion you felt for Nibbler was actually your own."
3161,FRY,Looks like Bender learned an important lesson about respecting other people's feelings afterall.
3162,FARNSWORTH,"No, I'm wrong. The empathy chip was running at triple capacity."
3163,BENDER,"And I still barely felt anything. Goodnight, losers!"
3164,LEELA,"You know, Bender may not have learned anything from me, but I think I actually learned something from him.  (shouting) So long, jerkwads!"
3165,FARNSWORTH,So long!
3166,THE END,
3167,"""BRANNIGAN, BEGIN AGAIN""",
3168,FRY,Hmm. Horsey to pointy guy six.  Check.
3169,BENDER,"Hmm. Get him, boys!"
3170,FRY,(hoarse) Good move.
3171,FARNSWORTH,"Good news, everyone.  We have a mission to further the noble cause of intergalactic peace."
3172,BENDER,Nope. Watching cartoons.
3173,FRY,Sorry.
3174,LEELA,What's the mission?
3175,FARNSWORTH,It's a delivery for the Democratic Order Of Planets.
3176,FRY,DOOP? What's that?
3177,FARNSWORTH,"It's similar to the United Nations from your time, Fry."
3178,FRY,Uh...
3179,HERMES,Or like the Federation from your Star Trek programme.
3180,FRY,(getting it) Oh!
3181,FARNSWORTH,Tonight is the ribbon-cutting for the DOOP's new headquarters.
3182,LEELA,What are we delivering?
3183,FARNSWORTH,Something without which no ribbon-cutting ceremony could proceed. The ceremonial oversized scissors.
3184,LEELA,We'll get them there as quickly as we can.
3185,FARNSWORTH,"Alright, but don't run with them."
3186,FRY,"Wow! There's a million aliens. I've never seen anything so mind blowing. Ooh, a reception table with muffins!"
3187,GLAB,"Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the ribbon-cutting ceremony of the DOOP's magnificent new headquarters. A fitting home for an organisation that has fostered peace throughout the universe. Even between the Insectoids and the Space Lizards."
3188,FRY,"So, what's it like on planet Amazonia?"
3189,AMAZONIAN,Big rats there. Me crush with club.
3190,FRY,That's so interesting. Maybe we could get to know each other over a coffee.
3191,GLAB,"I can think of no better place for this centre of diplomacy than here in orbit around the Neutral Planet.  What are your thoughts on this momentous occasion, Your Neutralness?"
3192,NEUTRAL PRESIDENT,I have no strong feelings one way or the other.
3193,ZAPP,"I hate these filthy Neutrals, Kif. With enemies you know where they stand but with Neutrals, who knows? It sickens me.  Halt.  Why, Leela. I do believe we've met."
3194,BENDER,(whispering) He means you guys did it.
3195,LEELA,"If you don't mind, we're here to deliver the scissors for the ribbon-cutting."
3196,ZAPP,Then you're under arrest.
3197,LEELA,What for?
3198,ZAPP,How do I know these scissors aren't part of some Neutral plot?
3199,LEELA,But they're not even sharp. Who could I possibly hurt with them?
3200,ZAPP,"The Yarn People of Nylar 4?  So, a plan to assassinate a weird-looking alien with scissors. How very Neutral of you."
3201,LEELA,What?
3202,ZAPP,"It was almost the perfect crime, but you forgot one thing: Rock crushes scissors ... but paper covers rock ... and scissors cut paper. Kif, we have a conundrum. Search them for paper, and bring me a rock."
3203,KIF,Why?
3204,ZAPP,"So beautiful, yet so neutral.  Drag them to the ship."
3205,GLAB,"And now, to cut the ribbon, the legendary DOOP captain who just returned from a triumphant carpet-bombing of Eden 7, Zapp Brannigan."
3206,ZAPP,What makes a man turn neutral? Lust for gold? Power? Or were you just born with a heart full of neutrality?
3207,KIF,"Um, sir, you're supposed to be cutting the ribbon right now."
3208,ZAPP,No matter. I'll simply cut it from here with the ships laser.
3209,KIF,"Sir, I don't think that's wise."
3210,ZAPP,"Kif, if there's one thing I don't need it's your I-don't-think-that's-wise attitude."
3211,ZAPP,Whoopsie-daisy.
3212,GLAB,"Zapp Brannigan, you stand accused of blowing up DOOP headquarters. How do you plead?"
3213,ZAPP,Absolutely 99% not guilty.
3214,GLAB,Then the prosecutor will call his first witness.
3215,HYPER-CHICKEN,"Your Honour, I'm just a simple Hyper-Chicken from a backwoods asteroid but if it please the court I reckon I'll call the entire jury."
3216,GLAB,I'm going to allow this.
3217,HYPER-CHICKEN,Members of the jury ...  ... did y'all happen to catch a gander at who blew up that there DOOP headquarters?
3218,JUROR #1,"(simultaneously) That's the guy, right there."
3219,JUROR #2,"(simultaneously) Oh, yeah, right there."
3220,SMALL GLURMO #1,(simultaneously) That one.
3221,HYPER-CHICKEN,And are y'all gonna vote to convict him?
3222,NEPTUNIAN,(simultaneously) You'd better believe it.
3223,JUROR #1,(simultaneously) You bet.
3224,GLAB,The jury is instructed to disregard its own testimony.
3225,HYPER-CHICKEN,"Your Honour, the prosecution rests."
3226,GLAB,"The evidence against Zapp Brannigan is strong. However, in light of his years of service, and the incompetence of this hillbilly prosecutor, I'm afraid I must dismiss all charges."
3227,LEELA,"Dismiss all charges? Your Honour, I know the case is closed and you've rendered your verdict, but I wanna testify."
3228,GLAB,I'm going to allow this.
3229,HYPER-CHICKEN,"Now, Miss Leela, on the date in question, were you or were you not wearing a hoop skirt?"
3230,LEELA,"That's a stupid question. What matters is Zapp Brannigan is the sorriest captain I've ever seen, and I saw the idiot blow up DOOP headquarters with my own eye."
3231,ZAPP,I'd like to cross-examine the witness.
3232,GLAB,I'm going to allow this.
3233,ZAPP,We've met before have we not?
3234,LEELA,(reluctantly) Yes.
3235,ZAPP,"And on that occasion, did you have sex with someone? May I remind you you are still under oath."
3236,LEELA,(reluctantly) Yes.
3237,ZAPP,Please point out the person in this courtroom you had sex with.  And his name is?
3238,LEELA,Zapp Brannigan.
3239,ZAPP,The very same Zapp Brannigan who did not blow up DOOP headquarters. I rest my case.
3240,GLAB,"Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, you may begin your deliberations."
3241,SMALL GLURMO #1,"Your Honour, we have reached a verdict. We find the defendant ... guilty."
3242,GLAB,"Zapp Brannigan, you are hereby stripped of your rank as captain and dismissed from the DOOP."
3243,ZAPP,"I'd like to make one final statement. Kif c'mere and hold up the flag.  And wave it a little for God's sakes. My friends, you can take away a man's title and his uniform but you can never take away his integrity or his honour. Plus it was mostly Kif's fault."
3244,KIF,What?
3245,GLAB,"Kif Kroker, you are also stripped of your rank and dishonourably discharged."
3246,ZAPP,"One day a man has everything, the next day he blows up a $400 billion space station and the next day he has nothing. It makes you think."
3247,KIF,"No, it doesn't."
3248,ZAPP,"Come, Kif, it's time to begin our life as civilians.  That's an order, soldier."
3249,FRY,"Hey, Bender?"
3250,BENDER,Yeah?
3251,LEELA,"Alright, this is the third hose fight I've broken up today and the second one using actual hoses. Now move your lazy asses and start scrubbing the ship like I ordered you to."
3252,FRY,"You don't have to get so mad, Leela."
3253,BENDER,"Yeah, Fry already wiped off some of the dirt with his finger."
3254,LEELA,Zapp?
3255,ZAPP,"Leela, I didn't know where else to turn. You're the only woman who ever loved me."
3256,LEELA,I never loved you.
3257,ZAPP,I mean physically.
3258,LEELA,What do you want?
3259,ZAPP,"Just let me work for a little food. Perhaps I could paint a fence, or service you sexually, or mop the floors."
3260,LEELA,You don't know how to do any of those things.
3261,ZAPP,Kif might.
3262,FARNSWORTH,"Leela, who are you talking to?"
3263,ZAPP,Just a broken-down hobo who's hit rock-bottom. And his commanding officer.
3264,FARNSWORTH,"Why, you're that disgraced starship captain.  Having him on staff will distract people from our horrendous safety record. Come in."
3265,FARNSWORTH,I'd like everyone to meet our new employees. (whispering) Which ones are new?
3266,HERMES,The green dude and the fat man.
3267,FARNSWORTH,"Hmm, I could swear I've never seen that robot before either."
3268,BENDER,I'm Bender. You know? The lovable rascal.
3269,FARNSWORTH,"Oh, yes, yes. My good friend, of course. Anyway, whoever you all are, I have good news. You'll be making a delivery to Stumbos 4, a planet with such high gravity you'll most likely be crushed under the weight of your own hair. Enjoy."
3270,ZAPP,"So, this Leela. I know she's a very sensuous woman but what manner of captain is she?"
3271,FRY,She's really strict.
3272,BENDER,And mean.
3273,ZAPP,I see. Does she by any chance give the crewmembers spankings?
3274,FRY,"No, she just makes us do work and stuff."
3275,ZAPP,"Good, good. But should she ever institute some sort of bare-bottom spanking policy let me go in your place. I won't have my comrades harmed."
3276,BENDER,"Hey, this guy's alright!"
3277,ZAPP,"Here's to us poor schmoes working for the man. Even if he is a hot, sexy, female man."
3278,KIF,"I've computed out landing co-ordinates, Captain."
3279,LEELA,"Thanks, Kif. Very nice work."
3280,KIF,"Wait, what?"
3281,LEELA,"I said ""very nice work""."
3282,KIF,This is the happiest day of my life.
3283,LEELA,"OK, crew, listen up. Your job is to delivery these 40 pillows to that hotel."
3284,BENDER,They're not very heavy but you don't hear me not complaining.
3285,LEELA,They're not heavy in here because we have an anti-grav pump. But once you get out on the surface the gravity will be very intense.
3286,FRY,"Hey, no prob', this lead apron'll protect me."
3287,LEELA,I don't want any screw-ups. Use the hover-dolly and just deliver one pillow at a time.
3288,BENDER,"Hey, here's an idea, let's deliver all the pillows at once."
3289,FRY,Yeah!
3290,ZAPP,That's using the old noodle!
3291,ZAPP,"Come on, girdle. Hold!"
3292,BENDER,Uh-oh.
3293,LEELA,What the hell happened?
3294,BENDER,"Some breaking occured, the dolly was involved, that's about all we know."
3295,LEELA,I told you dumb apes not to overload it. Each of those pillows weighs 150lbs here.
3296,FRY,"Alright, don't get your panties in a knot. We'll just use the back-up dolly."
3297,BENDER,I'll start loading up the pillows.
3298,LEELA,"No way, Jack. You disobeyed an order, so now you have to deliver all 40 pillows by hand."
3299,ZAPP,"Let me ask you a serious question, Leela: Does the company that made your bra make a girdle as well? I ask because a friend of mine--"
3300,LEELA,Just get to work.
3301,BENDER,"(mocking) I'm Leela, get to work, neh neh neh."
3302,FRY,I agree.
3303,KIF,"The point is, it's just so humiliating working for that man. Once, he actually ordered me to ... shave his armpits while he was in the bathtub. So, I said--"
3304,LEELA,"Y'know, why don't we talk about something besides Zapp for a while?"
3305,KIF,"Oh, alright. Um ... well ... how 'bout then, um...OK, well, there he was in the tub, alright?"
3306,FRY,"Ah, some good old high-gravity rain. That'll cool us off."
3307,BENDER,This is all Leela's fault.
3308,FRY,"Yeah. If she had let us use the back-up dolly, we could have broken it, given up and gone home by now."
3309,ZAPP,"Y'know boys, a good captain needs many skills, such as boldness, daring and a velour uniform. And I'm not convinced Leela has any of those things."
3310,FRY,"Ah, Leela's not that bad. I just wish she didn't make us work so much."
3311,ZAPP,"Back when I was captain all I asked from my men was their complete loyalty. If I had that, then for all I cared they could sit around the whole day drinking beer in their underpants."
3312,BENDER,Beer?
3313,FRY,Underpants?
3314,KIF,"But now, Zapp's not captain anymore. I'm free!  Oh, you hear that? I'm actually laughing!"
3315,FRY,This is a mutiny.
3316,BENDER,"You're outta here, lady. Zapp's the new captain."
3317,FRY,All hail the new captain.
3318,ZAPP,"Leela, you might be a formidible do-er of the nasty but I am forced to relieve you of your post."
3319,LEELA,"On what grounds, you slobbering oaf?"
3320,ZAPP,Failure to prevent a mutiny. Throw her in the brig.
3321,FRY,We don't have a brig.
3322,ZAPP,"Then throw her in the laundry room, which will hereafter be referred to as ""the brig""."
3323,LEELA,You really don't want me to be captain anymore?
3324,BENDER,"You got it, genius."
3325,LEELA,"But, didn't I do a good job?"
3326,FRY,You were mean and you yelled and you made us do all that work.
3327,LEELA,"Sometimes a captain needs to do those things. Besides I, I thought we were friends."
3328,FRY,"Yeah, well, you shouldn't have been such a mean captain then."
3329,BENDER,"Don't worry, Leela, soon we'll be able to look back on this and laugh."
3330,ZAPP,"Back in my old uniform, and it nearly still fits. Even after all that fattening hobo cuisine."
3331,KIF,"What shall I do with your civilian clothes, sir?"
3332,ZAPP,"Take them to the laundry-brig.  So, do I have your loyalty, men?"
3333,BENDER,To the ends of the universe.
3334,FRY,Ten hundred percent!
3335,ZAPP,That's not nearly loyal enough. I order you to sit around and drink beer until you're as loyal as Kif here.
3336,BENDER,"Yes, sir, sir!"
3337,KIF,"Um, may I have a beer, sir?"
3338,ZAPP,"No. You're loyal enough already. Meanwhile, I have a plan. We will single-handedly attack our archenemy the Neutral Planet."
3339,KIF,"Oh, jeez."
3340,ZAPP,"Once the neutral war machine lies in ruins, I'll be a hero again and the DOOP will reinstate me as captain."
3341,KIF,"But, sir, that plan makes no sense."
3342,ZAPP,"Maybe not to you, Kif, but if I recall correctly, you were court-martialed in disgrace."
3343,FRY,"Ooh, burn!"
3344,BENDER,"Nailed you, buddy!"
3345,ZAPP,Prepare to continue the epic struggle between good and neutral.
3346,FRY,"This is awesome! We're gonna be like pow-pow-pow, and they're gonna be like ...  ... and then we'll have pancakes to celebrate and I'll be like..."
3347,ZAPP,"Precisely. Now, in the name of all that is good and honourable, we'll call the Neutral President with a message of peace, then blast him."
3348,BENDER,"Yes sir, sirdy-sir-sir-sir!"
3349,ZAPP,Fly the white flag of war.
3350,ZAPP,This is Zapp Brannigan of the good ship ... Planet Express Ship. I come swinging the olive branch of peace.
3351,NEUTRAL PRESIDENT,All I know is my gut says maybe.
3352,BENDER,"What now, chief?"
3353,ZAPP,"Now we crash the ship into their headquarters, killing them in a hellish firestorm from which no living thing can escape."
3354,FRY,"Good, good, then what?"
3355,ZAPP,"Then your mission is complete. I, meanwhile, will have ejected to safety, wearing the only spacesuit on board."
3356,FRY,Wait a second. Is this plan gonna kill us?
3357,ZAPP,"Of course. What do you think I meant by ""loyalty""? Now help me into the only spacesuit. It looks a bit sweaty in there so you may need to apply baby powder."
3358,FRY,"Leela, we want you to be captain again."
3359,LEELA,Let me guess. He cancelled naptime? He ran out of beer?  So he's about to kill us?
3360,FRY,We want Leela to be captain again.
3361,ZAPP,"So it's mutiny is it? I never thought I'd see the day. Come, Kif, let's eject. I found a children's spacesuit you can wear."
3362,KIF,"To be honest, sir, I'd rather stay here with Captain Leela. She actually listens to what I have to--"
3363,LEELA,"Oh, no! He's disabled the steering. We're gonna crash!"
3364,BENDER,"Leela save me ... and yourself, I guess ... and my banjo.  And Fry."
3365,LEELA,"OK, OK. We have one chance. Are you willing to do what I say as captain?"
3366,FRY,Absolutely.
3367,LEELA,Even if I make you work hard?
3368,BENDER,As your God is my witness.
3369,LEELA,Then go get the hover-dolly you didn't break and load all the dark matter into the left engine.
3370,BENDER,"Oh, man, that crap's heavy."
3371,FRY,And warm.
3372,LEELA,Just do it.
3373,NEUTRAL PRESIDENT,"If I don't survive, tell my wife, ""Hello""."
3374,LEELA,Hurry! I don't wanna die at the age of 25.
3375,BENDER,"Honey, unless we hit a time warp, I wouldn't worry about it."
3376,FRY,It's too low.
3377,BENDER,Quick.
3378,LEELA,You did it! You actually did it!
3379,FRY,And no one will have to punish anyone for the mutiny.
3380,ZAPP,"And so, when Captain Leela panicked, perhaps distracted by female troubles, my quick thinking allowed me to do whatever I did to save the day."
3381,GLAB,"Captain Leela, is this rambling story of magic and heroism true?"
3382,LEELA,"Well, actually--"
3383,FARNSWORTH,(whispering) That a girl! If they don't take him back we can keep him as captain.
3384,LEELA,"Your Honour, it's all true: My female incompetence, Zapp's cat-like reflexes, the stuff that made no sense, all of it."
3385,GLAB,"In that case, Zapp Brannigan, I hereby restore your rank and parking privileges."
3386,FARNSWORTH,"Oh, foo!"
3387,ZAPP,"Come, Kif, we've got work to do."
3388,KIF,I-I'll call and tell you about it.
3389,FRY,"Leela, I just want you to know that even though you're mean, you're the best captain ever."
3390,BENDER,"Yeah, you're one dynamite lady. Can we have a week off?"
3391,LEELA,No.
3392,FRY,Please?
3393,BENDER,"Come on, Captain."
3394,LEELA,"Oh, alright."
3395,FARNSWORTH,No time off.
3396,FRY,"Aw, man."
3397,LEELA,Let's mutiny!
3398,THE END,

3402,BENDER,Cursed by his own hubris!
3403,LEELA,"There's a political debate on! Quick, change the channel!"
3404,BENDER,"Hey, that's what Fry said when we turned on the debate!"
3405,ANNOUNCER,(voice-over; on TV) C-SPAN9 presents: The Thrill Of Politics.
3406,LEELA,"Look, I know there are no car chases but this is important. One of these two men will become president of the world."
3407,FRY,What do we care? We live in the United States.
3408,LEELA,The United States is part of the world.
3409,FRY,Wow! I have been gone a long time.
3410,JOHNSON,"It's time someone had the courage to stand up and say: ""I'm against those things that everybody hates""."
3411,JACKSON,"Now I respect my opponent. I think he's a good man but, quite frankly, I agree with everything he just said!"
3412,FRY,These are the candidates? They sound like clones.  Wait a minute. They are clones!
3413,LEELA,Don't let their identical DNA fool you. They differ on some key issues.
3414,JOHNSON,I say your three cent titanium tax goes too far.
3415,JACKSON,And I say your three cent titanium tax doesn't go too far enough!
3416,FRY,"If I were registered to vote, I send these clowns a message by staying home on election day and dressing up like a clown."
3417,LEELA,You're not registered?
3418,FRY,Nope. Not vaccinated either! Besides. It's not like one vote ever made a difference.
3419,LEELA,That's not true. The first robot president won by exactly one vote.
3420,BENDER,"Ah, yes. John Quincy Adding Machine. He struck a cord with the voters when he pledged not to go on a killing spree."
3421,FARNSWORTH,"But, like most politicians, he promised more than he could deliver."
3422,LEELA,"The point is, one vote can make a difference and even though it won't, I'm still taking you to get registered."
3423,FARNSWORTH,"Yes, that's a capital idea. Let's all go register."
3424,FRY,"Professor, when did you become so obsessed with voting?"
3425,FARNSWORTH,The very instant I became old.
3426,FARNSWORTH,The problem with both parties is that they always want to give your tax dollars to the less fortunate.
3427,FRY,The less fortunate get all the breaks!
3428,ZOIDBERG,"You know, Fry, you could join a third party, maybe."
3429,AMY,Only weirdos and mutants join third parties.
3430,ZOIDBERG,Really? I'd better keep an eye out at the next meeting.
3431,FRY,"What party do you belong to, Bender?"
3432,BENDER,I'm not allowed to vote.
3433,FRY,'Cause you're a robot?
3434,BENDER,"No, convicted felon."
3435,WOMAN,We favour unreasonably huge subsidies to the Brain Slug Planet.
3436,FRY,"OK, but what are the Brain Slugs who control you gonna do for the working man?"
3437,WOMAN,Attach Brain Slugs to them.
3438,FRY,"(sarcastic) Sure, you say that now!"
3439,AMY,"So, is it true you can make all kinds of shirts and ropes out of hemp?"

3441,AMY,I also heard hemp makes great shampoo.
3442,STONED GUY,It does? No way! I gotta check out this brochure!

3444,N.R.A. MAN,"Well, first off, we're gonna get rid of that three-day waiting period for mad scientists."
3445,FARNSWORTH,"Damn straight! Today, the mad scientist can't get a doomsday device, tomorrow it's the mad grad student. Where will it end?"
3446,N.R.A. MAN,"Amen, brother. I don't go anywhere without my mutated anthrax......for duck hunting."
3447,ZOIDBERG,"Sure, humans are cute, but how else are we supposed to test cosmetics?"
3448,HERMES,I concur.
3449,FRY,Now here's a party I can get excited about. Sign me up!
3450,V.A.P. MAN,"Sorry, not with that attitude."
3451,FRY,"(downbeat) OK then, screw it."
3452,V.A.P. MAN,"Welcome aboard, brother!"
3453,FRY,(excited) Alright!
3454,V.A.P. MAN,You're out.
3455,FRY,That was pretty cool. I think I'm actually starting to get interested in politics.
3456,LINDA,"And so, with two weeks left in the campaign, the question on everyone's mind is who will be the next president of Earth? Jack Johnson or bitter rival John Jackson? Two terrific candidates, huh, Morbo?"
3457,MORBO,All humans are vermin in the eyes of Morbo.
3458,LINDA,"In other local news, disaster struck on Saturn’s moon of Titan today, when a titanium mine collapsed, trapping 1,000 robot workers."
3459,BENDER,What? Lord have mercy!
3460,LINDA,"Unless something is done quickly, the trapped robots will be dead within 300 years.  Sir, what rescue operations are planned?"
3461,MINE SPOKESMAN,The plan is basically to pave over the area and get on with our lives.
3462,MORBO,News of the mines closing sent titanium prices skyrocketing.
3463,BENDER,Alright! I'm rich!
3464,LEELA,What are you talking about?
3465,BENDER,My body's 40% titanium!  I'm finally richer than those snooty ATM machines.
3466,FRY,Too bad you can't spend it.
3467,BENDER,"(ironic) Oh, can't I?"
3468,FRY,No.
3469,BENDER,"Watch me, poor man."
3470,PAWNBROKER,(from inside) Pleasure doing business with you.
3471,BENDER,"Game's over, losers. I have all the money! Compare your lives to mine and then kill yourselves!  Hey, get away. Shoo! I'll give you five dollars to not do what you're thinking about doing. You just lost five dollars!"
3472,BENDER,"Hey, buddy. Little help?  (shouting) Thank you!"
3473,BENDER,"Hello, peasants."
3474,LEELA,Bender? What happened to you?
3475,FRY,"Yeah, you look different. Did you get a haircut?"
3476,BENDER,"No, I sold my body."
3477,FARNSWORTH,"Sold your body? Oh, Bender, I've been down that road. I know it's glamorous and the parties are great but you'll end up spending every dollar you make on jewellery and skintight pants."
3478,FRY,"This is crazy, Bender. How are you gonna live without a body?"
3479,BENDER,Pft. Bodies are for hookers and fat people! All I need is a wad of cash with a head wrapped around it.
3480,FRY,"Well, at least now you can pay off your loan shark."
3481,BENDER,"Yeah, right. What's he gonna do, break my legs?"
3482,BENDER,"Ah, this is the life. Another martini, please."
3483,BENDER,"Shaken, not stirred.  Aw, yeah!"
3484,BENDER,Put it all on black.
3485,CROUPIER,"21 red.  I beg your pardon, 33 black."
3486,BENDER,Yes! The rich get richer!
3487,BENDER,"Strike! In your face, Leela!  Ow!"
3488,BENDER,(shouting) Timber!
3489,FRY,"Hey, Bender, can I take a ride in your car?"
3490,BENDER,"Maybe if you clean up first. It looks like your neck stepped in something. Oh, I'm sorry, that's just your body!"
3491,FRY,Hey! You look me in the shins and say that.
3492,BENDER,"I've had it up to here with this place. I'm off to the Head Museum to hang out with classy heads like me who appreciate the finer things: poetry, philosophy, hats. So long, coffin stuffers.  Uh, could one of you coffin stuffers please carry me?"
3493,BENDER,"Now, which group of heads is good enough for me to hang out with? What do you think, Fry? Fry?"
3494,SCHIFFER,"Hi, I'm Claudia Schiffer's head."
3495,FRY,I recognise you. Didn't you used to have a body of some sort?
3496,SCHIFFER,"Yeah, but it was holding me back. You know, I just did the cover of the Sports Illustrated Swimcap Issue."
3497,FRY,"Well, you're looking great."
3498,SCHIFFER,Thanks. I wouldn't mind losing a few pounds though.
3499,FRY,Couldn't hurt.
3500,BENDER,"Ah, US presidents.  Sturdy shelves, good security.  This place has class."
3501,CLINTON,"(to Leela) Hey, sugar cookie. You know, legally, nothing I can do counts as sex anymore."
3502,FORD,"I apologise for his rudeness, ma'am. He gets this way around meaty-looking women."
3503,FRY,"(to Clinton) Hey, I remember you. I was gonna vote for you one time. But voting isn't cool so I stayed home alone and got trashed on Listerine."
3504,FORD,"Frankly, I've never felt voting to be all that essential to the process."
3505,NIXON,"No kidding, Ford."
3506,BENDER,"So then the hookerbot says, ""That's not my expansion slot"" and my friends says, ""That's not my gold-plated 25-pin connector!"""
3507,WASHINGTON,"Oh, Bender. Thou robots really cracketh me up."
3508,BENDER,"You know, I like it here. What's the rent on one of these jars?"
3509,BUSH SR.,"Sorry, Bender, but we just can't allow every Tom, Dick, and Harry to move in. No offence, Jefferson, Nixon and Truman."
3510,CARTER,Maybe Mr. Bender can get a spot in the closet of presidential losers.
3511,DOLE,"Bob Dole needs company. LaRouche won't stop with the ""knock knock"" jokes."
3512,BENDER,Pass.
3513,WASHINGTON,"So, telleth, Bender. What hath happened to your body?"
3514,BENDER,I hocked it.
3515,WASHINGTON,Hocked it? Why wouldst thou do that?
3516,BENDER,Same reason you hocked your teeth.
3517,WASHINGTON,Ah. Booze money.
3518,NIXON,"I remember my body; flabby, pastey-skinned, riddled with phlebitis. A good Republican body! God, I loved it."
3519,FRY,"I hear that. I spent most of my teen years loving my body. Course, it was tough love but -- ooh!"
3520,LEELA,"Fry, he opened up relations with China. He doesn't want to hear about your ding-dong."
3521,BENDER,"So, Nixon. Even if you miss your body, being a head's great too, right?"
3522,NIXON,"No, son. It's a sad and lonely life."
3523,BENDER,"Oh, great. Now you tell me!"
3524,NIXON,That's my style. I like to kick 'em when they're down!
3525,BENDER,"(sleep-talking) Ones...zeros...one, one, zero, zero, one --"
3526,FRY,"Bender, what is it?"
3527,BENDER,"Whoa, what an awful dream. Ones and zeros everywhere. And I thought I saw a two."
3528,FRY,"It was just a dream, Bender. There's no such thing as two."
3529,BENDER,"I know what this is about. My body loved me, and I turned its back on it. Well, old friend, tie a yellow ribbon round your neck, 'cause I'm a-comin' home!"
3530,BENDER,You sold my body? To who?!
3531,PAWNBROKER,"I can't reveal that information, but you look like a nice robot. Tell you what, I'll give you 50 bucks for the kid."
3532,FRY,"Hey, my clothes are worth 50 bucks!"
3533,PAWNBROKER,Deal.
3534,BENDER,(crying) Oh! How could I let this happen? I can't go through the rest of my life like this.
3535,FARNSWORTH,Don't you have a self-destruct button?
3536,BENDER,"(crying) Yeah, but it's on my body. What am I gonna do?"
3537,FRY,"Ah, I can't stand to see a robot cry. Let's watch TV!"
3538,NIXON,"And so, ladies and gentlemen, I'm throwing my head into the ring. I'm announcing my candidacy for the presidency of Earth."
3539,JOURNALIST #1,Just one question.
3540,CHANG,"Scoop Chang, Beijing Bugle. Sir, the constitution clearly states that nobody can be elected president more than twice."
3541,NIXON,"That's right, nobody.  But as you can plainly see, I've got a shiny new body!"
3542,BENDER,Oh!
3543,LEELA,"Bender, he's got your body!"
3544,BENDER,"That dirty, double-crossing bastard! How dare he run off with Richard Nixon!"
3545,LEELA,Nixon must have bought your body from the pawn shop.
3546,FRY,"Yeah, and that electric guitar."
3547,NIXON,(singing; on TV} Remember what the dormouse said
3548,BENDER,"Yeah you are, you stole my body! Fry, Leela, you gotta help me!"
3549,LEELA,"Ordinarily I'd say no and lecture you on how this is your own fault for being such an idiot. But when a robotic Nixon is on the loose, we have a duty to take action. Idiot."
3550,MORBO,"Morbo will now introduce tonight's candidates: Puny Human #1, Puny Human #2, and Morbo's good friend, Richard Nixon."
3551,NIXON,"Hello, Morbo. How's the family?"
3552,MORBO,Belligerent and numerous.
3553,NIXON,Good man. Nixon's pro-war and pro-family.
3554,BENDER,"Great. First he steals my body, now he's touching my stuff."
3555,LEELA,Come on. We've gotta find some way to talk to him.
3556,MORBO,Morbo demands an answer to the following question: If you saw delicious candy in the hands of a small child would you seize and consume it?
3557,JOHNSON,Unthinkable.
3558,JACKSON,I wouldn't think of it.
3559,MORBO,"What about you, Mr. Nixon? I remind you you are under a truth-o-scope."
3560,NIXON,"Uh, well, I, uh...the question is-is vague. You don't say what kind of candy, whether anyone is watching or uh... At any rate, I certainly wouldn't harm the child."
3561,CAMPAIGN MANAGER,"You scored big points tonight, sir."
3562,NIXON,What are you talking about? They ate me alive out there.
3563,CAMPAIGN MANAGER,"Yes, but your body stayed on message. And that message is, ""Look at my shiny new body"". The robots ate it up. You've got real charisma from the neck down."
3564,NIXON,"Nixon with charisma? My God, I can rule the universe!"
3565,BENDER,Give me my body back you two-bit thief!
3566,NIXON,"Now look here, you drugged out communist. I paid for this body and I'd no sooner return it than I would my little cocker spaniel dog, Checkers.  Shut up, damnit!"
3567,FRY,"Please, Mr. Nixon. We're appealing to your sense of decency."
3568,BENDER,That was a good one!
3569,NIXON,"Seriously though, I'm never giving back this body. Now beat it! Before I get Cambodian on your asses!"
3570,BENDER,(crying) It's hopeless. We might as well turn in my head for the five cent deposit.
3571,FRY,"No way! I'm not letting my best friend get recycled. Not for five cents, not for five hundred cents! Leela, I've got a plan!"
3572,LEELA,I've got a better plan.
3573,FRY,(whispering) Why would Nixon stay at the Watergate?
3574,LEELA,(whispering) They give you a discount if you've been here before.
3575,FRY,"Keep going, we're right behind you."
3576,BENDER,"Whoa, mama! Get a room, you two!"
3577,MAN,We're in a room!
3578,BENDER,Well then lose some weight.
3579,NIXON,(sleep-talking) Aroo!
3580,NIXON,"(sleep-talking) Oh, yeah. You women's libbers really know how to party!"
3581,BENDER,(whispering) Psst! There I am!
3582,NIXON,"(sleep-talking) Hey, Betty Friedan. Send a little of that lotion my way!"
3583,LEELA,"OK, almost got it. Steady. Steady. Don't panic."
3584,FRY,Ooh!  Uh-oh!
3585,NIXON,What the...?  You shaggy peaceniks have some nerve!
3586,BENDER,I'm just here for what's mine. Don't make me kick your neck.
3587,NIXON,"Bring it on, soup can."
3588,LEELA,"Alright, break it up, you two!"
3589,NIXON,"That's it. You're all going to jail. And don't expect me to grant a pardon like that sissy, Ford."
3590,LEELA,You'll never pardon anybody because you'll never get elected president. The voters of Earth aren't the pea-brained idiots they were back in your time.
3591,NIXON,"Oh, no? Well, listen here, missy. Computers may be twice as fast as they were in 1973 but your average voter is as drunk and stupid as ever. The only one who's changed is me. I've become bitter and, let's face it, crazy over the years. And once I'm swept into office, I'll sell our children's organs to zoos for meat and I'll go into people's houses at night and wreck up the place."
3592,FRY,"Well, he lost my vote."
3593,NIXON,"Like one vote ever made a difference. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to inch myself over to the phone and call the police."
3594,BENDER,"Not so fast, Nixon! Are you familiar with audio tape?"
3595,NIXON,Uh-oh. I don't like where this is heading.
3596,NIXON,And I'll go into people's houses at night and wreck up the place!
3597,NIXON,My God? I really sound like that? I thought my voice had more of a Clark Gable quality.
3598,LEELA,"The jig's up, Nixon. We'll trade you the tape for the body."
3599,NIXON,"Oh, expletive deleted. You've got a deal."
3600,FRY,"Hey, I've got one last thought."
3601,BENDER,"Ah, it's good to be back in one piece again. Except I can't get these damn bumper stickers off."
3602,LINDA,The sheer drama of this election has driven voter turnout to it's highest level in centuries -- 6%
3603,MORBO,Exit polls show evil underdog Richard Nixon trailing with an estimated zero votes.
3604,LEELA,Yes! The system works!
3605,LINDA,The time is 7:59 and the robot polls are now opening...and the robot vote is in. Nixon has won!
3606,LEELA,No!
3607,FRY,What?
3608,BENDER,Get out of town!
3609,FRY,Why would robots vote for Nixon now that he's just a head in a jar?
3610,CAMPAIGN MANAGER,I give you the next president of Earth!
3611,NIXON,(shouting) Nixon's back!
3612,FARNSWORTH,I can't believe it. He won by a single vote.
3613,BENDER,"Well it ain't my fault. I'm a non-voting felon, thank you."
3614,FRY,Well it's not my fault either 'cause I forgot to vote.
3615,LEELA,"Oh, crud. I knew there was something I meant to do today."
3616,MORBO,Morbo congratulates out gargantuan cyborg president. May death come quickly to his enemies.
3617,NIXON,Aroo! Who's kicking who around now? Aroo! Aroooo!
3618,NIXON,Knock knock!
3619,THE END,
3620,"""XMAS STORY""",
3621,ANNOUNCER,Ladies and gentlemen: Conan O'Brien's head.
3622,O'BRIEN,"Thank you, thank you. Let's get started. Max, play me over.  Looks like someone forgot to feed Max.  So, people are getting pretty worried about this Y2K problem, huh?"
3623,BENDER,No. they fixed that 900 years ago.
3624,O'BRIEN,"Just bear with me, sir. Anyway, I'm walking to work this morning--"
3625,BENDER,I doubt it!
3626,O'BRIEN,"Listen, pal, I may have lost my freakishly long legs in the war of 2012 but I've still got something you'll never have: A soul!"
3627,BENDER,Eh.
3628,O'BRIEN,"And freckles!  Well, I'm out of material. You can catch me next week at the Andromeda Chuckle Hut. Enjoy your breakfast."
3629,BENDER,"Ah, lets face it: Comedy's a dead art form. Now tragedy ...  ... That's funny!"
3630,FARNSWORTH,"Come on, everyone. Perhaps some skiing will help us forget the mouldy old antics of Conan O'Brien."
3631,AMY,Yeah!
3632,LEELA,Great idea!
3633,ZOIDBERG,We can only hope!
3634,FRY,This snow is beautiful. I'm glad global warming never happened.
3635,LEELA,Actually it did. But thank God nuclear winter cancelled it out.
3636,FRY,Hi!
3637,BENDER,"Enough of your mindless chitchat, let's get going."
3638,HERMES,Jah damnit! We're stuck.
3639,ZOIDBERG,At least you're not cold blooded!
3640,HERMES,Sweet lion of Zion! Look at the Professor go.
3641,FRY,Look out! We're heading straight for those trees!
3642,LEELA,"Yeah, yeah, relax. Trees down."
3643,TREES,(mechanical voice) Trees down.
3644,FRY,Cool. Hey what do you do if you want the trees up?
3645,TREES,(mechanical voice) Trees up
3646,FRY,(hoarse) Trees down!
3647,TREES,(mechanical voice) Trees down.
3648,BENDER,"Lookin' good, meatball!"
3649,MAN,"Excuse me, sir, you're snowboarding off the trail."
3650,BENDER,Lick my frozen metal ass.  Uh-oh!
3651,CHILD,(shouting) Mommy!
3652,ZOIDBERG,"You, a bobsledder? That I'd like to see!"
3653,HERMES,"Listen, you filthy crab, a thousand years ago there was a legendary team of Jamaican bobsledders."
3654,FRY,"Yup, I remember. They came in last at the Olympics then retired to promote alcoholic beverages."
3655,HERMES,"A true inspiration for the children. Um, a little help please?  (screaming) Nooo!"
3656,FRY,"Oh, what the hell!  Ow!"
3657,AMY,You poor man. What happened to you?
3658,MAN,"Well, there I was on the triple diamond slope, when suddenly--"
3659,AMY,"Oh, excuse me.  Hello there."
3660,FARNSWORTH,Wha?
3661,BENDER,Ah! Nothing like a warm fire and a Super Soaker of fine cognac.
3662,FRY,"Yeah, it really puts you in the Christmas spirit."
3663,FARNSWORTH,What-mas?
3664,FRY,Christmas. You know? X-M-A-S.
3665,LEELA,"Oh, you mean Xmas. You must be using an archaic pronunciation. Like when you say ""ask"" instead of ""aks""."
3666,FRY,"Xmas, huh?  Y'know this'll be my first Xmas away from home."
3667,LEELA,"Hey, hey. Let me aks you something: Would it cheer you up if we went and cut down an Xmas tree?"
3668,FRY,Yeah! An old-fashioned Xmas tree!
3669,FRY,Hey! These aren't Xmas trees!
3670,FARNSWORTH,Eh wha?
3671,FRY,"They're supposed to be some kinda, you know, pine tree."
3672,FARNSWORTH,"Pine trees have been extinct for 800 years, Fry. Gone the way of the poodle and your primitive notions of modesty. Ah! Brisk!"
3673,FRY,This isn't the way Christmas is supposed to be.
3674,FARNSWORTH,"There, there."
3675,FRY,Everything's changed.
3676,LEELA,That's not true.
3677,BENDER (SINGING),Xmas tree oh Xmas tree! Bah boo bee boo bah bee boh.
3678,AMY,Ow!
3679,FRY,(nostalgic) Every Christmas my mom would get a fresh goose for goose burgers and my dad would whip up his special eggnog out of bourbon and ice cubes. This dumb holiday just makes me think of all the things I left behind. Let's just stop talking about Xmas.
3680,HERMES,"Happy Xmas, Xmas people! Xmas cards have arrived! Xmas!  Amy, there you go, Fry, Professor, Zoidberg, a mighty haul for Bender."
3681,BENDER,Yes! I got the most! I win Xmas!
3682,HERMES,"And last, but not least, the sweet flower of the office: Me. Hermes Conrad."
3683,BENDER,"Hmm.  Ah, a picture of my mommy."
3684,ZOIDBERG,"Huh? What's this?  A card from my cousin Zoidfarb.  Instead of ""Claus"" he writes ""Claws""! Now that's humorous. Today's comedians could learn from this card."
3685,FRY,"What's the point of Xmas when everyone you know died a thousand years ago? I'm the lonliest person on Earth.  Hey, Leela, how 'bout a little sympathy here, huh?  Yoiks! What was that about?"
3686,AMY,Fluh! She's an orphan.
3687,FARNSWORTH,"Yes, and the only one of her species in all the known universe. What a lonely life."
3688,FRY,My God! Poor Leela.
3689,BENDER,"(upbeat) Hey, buddy, heard you needed cheering up! Well old Bender'll make you laugh.  Look at me look!  Oh, man, I gotta work on my act!"
3690,FRY,I feel like a rat. Here I am whining like a pig while all along Leela was lonely as a frog. I could kick myself.
3691,AMY,I'll do it for you.
3692,FRY,Ow! Thanks.
3693,FARNSWORTH,"You should be ashamed of yourself, Fry. You'd have to be blind not to notice that Leela's a cyclops."
3694,HERMES,"Fry's over there, man."
3695,FARNSWORTH,Oh?
3696,BENDER,Xmas Eve; Another day where I accomplish nothing.
3697,LINDA,The holiday season is a time of celebration for most. But it is also a time to remember the tragic suffering of the less fortunate.
3698,MORBO,Earthlings do not yet know the meaning of suffering.
3699,LINDA,"Earlier today I visited a shelter for down-and-out robots.  Homeless robots, too poor to afford even the basic alchohol they need to fuel their circuits. Is there anything sadder? Only drowning puppies. And there would have to be a lot of them."
3700,AMY,"Where are you going, Bender?"
3701,BENDER,To volunteer at a liquor kitchen for homeless robots.
3702,HERMES,"Yeah, right! As if you ever did anything charitable."
3703,BENDER,I'm very generous. What about that time I gave blood?
3704,FRY,Whose blood?
3705,BENDER,Some guy's.
3706,FRY,I've got to do something to show Leela how sorry I am.
3707,ZOIDBERG,So what's the problem? Just get down on your claws and do the apology dance.
3708,FRY,"So it's left, left, right-- Wait! I have a better idea! I'll go out and get her the perfect Xmas present. Something so great she'll never want to be unhappy again."
3709,HERMES,"Just be back by sundown, mon."
3710,FRY,We'll see. I like to haggle.
3711,AMY,You can't stay out on Xmas Eve. You'll be killed!
3712,FRY,Say what?
3713,FARNSWORTH,Good Lord! He doesn't know about Santa Claus.
3714,FRY,I know about Santa Claus.
3715,FARNSWORTH,"Back in 2801, the Friendly Robot Company built a robotic Santa to determine who'd be naughty and who'd been nice and distribute presents accordingly. But something went wrong."
3716,FRY,Wow! 2801! Anyway...
3717,FARNSWORTH,"Wait, you fool! Due to a programming error, Santa's standards were set too high and he invariably judges everyone to be naughty."
3718,AMY,"If he catches you after dark, he'll chop off your head and stuff your neck full of toys from his sack of horrors."
3719,FARNSWORTH,Nice meeting you.
3720,PREACHERBOT,"Welcome, brother! May the blessings of the season be upon you."
3721,BENDER,"Yeah, yeah, amen. Listen, I'm one of those lazy homeless bums I've been hearing about. Could you point me to the free booze.  Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!"
3722,FRY,There's this girl who I really like but she thinks I'm a jerk. Can you help me?
3723,SALESMAN #1,"Yeah, there's a suicide booth in the food court. Though there's a line this time of year."
3724,FRY,"No, I need to get her a gift. And I need it before sundown."
3725,SALESMAN #1,"Well, you can't go wrong with something traditional.  A Surface-to-Santa rocket launcher. It comes with three jolly-seeking missiles."
3726,FRY,That's funny!
3727,SALESMAN #1,"Careful, sir!"
3728,BENDER,"Oh, yeah! You filthy hobos sure kow how to live.  Hey, chief, someone's stealing your handkerchief full of crap."
3729,TINNY TIM,"Excuse me, sir? Might I have a sip of booze?"
3730,PREACHERBOT,"I'm sorry, Tinny Tim. Seems we ran out early tonight."
3731,TINNY TIM,I understand.
3732,BENDER,My God! That poor kid!
3733,FRY,You're the last store open. I need something for my friend Leela.  Just give me your best animal.
3734,SALESMAN #2,Best? Well that's a matter of opinion. I personally like the Electric Snail.
3735,FRY,That's a stupid animal. You're stupid! I said I want the best one. Now which costs more? The parrot or the Stink Lizard?
3736,SALESMAN #2,"The lizards are a buck each, the parrot is $500."
3737,FRY,"That's a hell of a good parrot. Although, I could get 500 lizards for the same price. Girls like swarms of lizards, right?"
3738,SALESMAN #2,"Sir, the store is closing in two minutes."
3739,FRY,"Alright, I'll take the 500 lizards. No, wait, yes. No. Yes. Yes. Yes! The parrot!"
3740,FRY,"Well, I spent every penny I had but I bet Leela's gonna love you.  Hey, you're quite the talker, aren't you? Shut the hell up!  Ow!  Stupid bird! I know where you live."
3741,AMY,"Hey, it's Leela."
3742,LEELA,Sorry I stormed out before. I didn't mean to ruin everyone's Xmas.
3743,FARNSWORTH,Huh? You were gone?
3744,LEELA,It's just that I get tired of Fry always only thinking of himself.
3745,HERMES,I hear that! I aks him to set the table. Instead he goes out to buy you a present. Selfish dog.
3746,LEELA,Wait! You mean he's still out? His life's in danger!
3747,ZOIDBERG,Why?
3748,LEELA,I'm telling you why. Santa Claus is coming to town!
3749,FRY,"Alright, bird, you thought you could beat me in a game of wits. But you just met your equal."
3750,FRY,Aha! Cornered!
3751,LEELA,Hi there!
3752,FRY,"Leela! Oh, my God! You saved my life. I am gonna get you so many lizards."
3753,LEELA,"You didn't need to buy me a present, Fry."
3754,FRY,"I just wanted to do something to make you happy. I mean, I miss my family but you never even had a family."
3755,LEELA,It's OK. You're lonely and I'm lonely. But together we're lonely together.
3756,FRY,"Merry Xmas, Leela."
3757,LEELA,Merry Xmas.
3758,FRY,"Oh, boy! It's Santa!"
3759,SANTA,"Ho, ho, ho!  You've been very naughty, Fry and Leela. I checked my list."
3760,FRY,Well check it twice!
3761,SANTA,I perform over 50 mega-checks per second. You're both naughty for disregarding each other's feelings.
3762,LEELA,But we set things right. Fry even risked his life to get me a present.
3763,SANTA,But what about your other co-workers? Did either of you ever stop to think about Dr. Zoidberg's feelings?
3764,FRY,No! I swear!
3765,SANTA,Santa has something very special in his sack for you two!
3766,ROBOTS,"(singing) So lock the door and hit the floor,"
3767,HATTIE,Go away!
3768,BENDER,"Whoa, hold on! How about inviting us in for a traditional glass of hard cider?"
3769,HATTIE,"Oh, alright. But just one glass!  (from inside) OK, that's enough.  I said that's enough!"
3770,BENDER,(from inside) Get her purse!
3771,FRY,Please let us live! We'll put out milk and cookies for you!
3772,SANTA,You dare bribe Santa? I'm going to shove coal so far up your stocking you'll be coughing up diamonds!
3773,LEELA,We're trapped.
3774,FRY,"I never thought it would end this way: Gunned down by Santa Claus. Honestly, I didn't see it coming!"
3775,LEELA,"Goodbye, Fry."
3776,FRY,"Goodbye, Leela.  Hey, look: We're under the mistletoe."
3777,SANTA,Your mistletoe is no match for my T.O.W. missile!
3778,FRY,"Uh, you're present may need some assembly."
3779,BENDER,(singing) On the 4th day of Xmas I stole from that lady.
3780,ROBOT #1,(singing) Four family photos.
3781,TINNY TIM,(singing) Three jars of pennies.
3782,ROBOT #2,(singing) Two former husbands.
3783,BENDER,(singing) And a slipper on a shoe tree.
3784,RAOUL,"Oh, thank you!"
3785,FRY,(shouting) Help!
3786,LEELA,(shouting) Somebody help us.
3787,TINNY TIM,"It's humans. Shall we mug them, robot sir?"
3788,BENDER,"No, wait, I know these guys. They got nothing."
3789,SANTA,"Ho ho ho!  You've been very naughty, Bender."
3790,BENDER,What? Me? I didn't do nothing. You're thinking of the kid.
3791,SANTA,"My God, Bender! Framing an orphan? That's so naughty I'll have to add it to my list right now.  Framing ... I-N-G ... ... an ..."
3792,ZOIDBERG,"Amy, this is for you: A set of combs for your beautiful hair."
3793,AMY,"Oh, that's so sweet. But I sold my hair to a wigmaker so I could buy a set of combs for Hermes."
3794,HERMES,"Oh, the irony. I sold my hair so I could buy this third set of combs for Zoidberg."
3795,ZOIDBERG,Thank you. These'll come in handy for my new hair.  Finally I look as pretty as I feel!
3796,FRY,(shouting; from outside) Help!
3797,LEELA,(shouting; from outside) Help!
3798,BENDER,(shouting; from outside) Help!
3799,FARNSWORTH,"Oh, dear. They'll be killed on our doorstep. And there's no trash pickup until January 3rd."
3800,HERMES,Sweet manatee of Galilee! He's on the roof!
3801,FARNSWORTH,Quick! The armour-plated chimney cover! Push! Push!
3802,BENDER,Use teamwork!
3803,TINNY TIM,"Oh, dear! Oh, dear!"
3804,SANTA,"You've all been very naughty. Very naughty indeed. Except you, Dr. Zoidberg, this is for you."
3805,ZOIDBERG,A pogo-stick!
3806,SANTA,"As for the rest of you, I'm going to tear off your skin like wrapping paper and deck the halls with your guts."
3807,BENDER,"Yeah? Well I don't believe in Santa Claus. Come on, everybody, if you don't believe in him he can't hurt you.  Ow! God! The pain!"
3808,SANTA,Ho ho ho! Time to get jolly on your naughty asses!
3809,LEELA,Watch out! His belly is shaking like a bowl full of nitro-glycerine!
3810,AMY,Rudolph's nose!
3811,FRY,(shouting) He's gonna blow.
3812,ZOIDBERG,Aha!
3813,FARNSWORTH,"Yes, good thing I got us out of that one!"
3814,BENDER,"Xmas dinner, everyone."
3815,FRY,"Uh, Bender? Where did you get that bird?"
3816,BENDER,"I found it lying in the street, like all the food I cook. Dig in, everyone."
3817,TINNY TIM,"Thank you, sir."
3818,BENDER,You got the toenail!  Oh!
3819,FRY,"Look, the food isn't what's important."
3820,TINNY TIM,I'm so hungry.
3821,FRY,"The important thing is we're all together for Xmas. And even though I'm surrounded by robots and monsters and old people, I've never felt more at home."
3822,FARNSOWRTH,"Hear, hear! Now let's all of us shut up and sing!"
3823,AMY (SINGING),He knows when you are sleeping.
3824,FARNSWORTH (SINGING),He knows when you're on the can.
3825,LEELA (SINGING),He'll hunt you down and blast your ass from here to Pakistan.
3826,ZOIDBERG (SINGING),Oh.
3827,HERMES (SINGING),"You'd better not breathe, You'd better not move."
3828,BENDER (SINGING),"You're better off dead, I'm telling you, dude."
3829,FRY (SINGING),Santa Claus is gunning you down!
3830,FARNSWORTH,"Merry Xmas, everyone!"
3831,SANTA,I'll be back. Back when you least expect it: Next Xmas! Ho ho ho!
3832,"""WHY MUST I BE A CRUSTACEAN IN LOVE?""",
3833,SINGERS,Call Robo-Rooter when you flush your towel ...
3834,PLUMBERBOT,... And we can also help with an impacted bowel.
3835,SINGERS,Robo-Rooter!
3836,FRY,Mmm. Mmm! Now this is what I call a thousand years of progress: A Bavarian creamdog that's also self-microwaving!
3837,BENDER,"Aw, jeez. Let's just pray I have the energy to get myself another beer. Oh, what is this? The Middle Ages?"
3838,LEELA,"Look at you guys. No offence, Fry, but you've become a fat sack of crap."
3839,FRY,Sack?
3840,AMY,"And, Bender, your beer belly's so big your door won't even close. And that doesn't even make sense."
3841,LEELA,Come on. We're taking you pigs to the gym.
3842,ZOIDBERG,"The gymnasium? Excellent, excellent. For some reason I'm frisky as a squid on Tuesday."
3843,AMY,"Hey, who's up for a nice hot steam?"
3844,ZOIDBERG,We crustaceans don't like steam. I'm going to go work out with the Nautilus!
3845,NAUTILUS,"What up, Dr. Z?"
3846,ZOIDBERG,"Yo, yo, yo! Whassup whassup! Give up the rock!"
3847,FRY,Co-ed steam rooms! I love the future!
3848,LEELA,"Uh, Fry, you're in the womens' steam room."
3849,FRY,"Ah, futuristic!"
3850,AMY,"Psst, look what life was like before genetic engineering."
3851,LEELA,Those poor 20th century women.
3852,AMY,"(sexfully) Hey, handsome. Is there room in there for two?"
3853,MAN,You wish!
3854,FRY,"Hey, Leela, look who's the super-stud!"
3855,LEELA,"Hmm, somebody must have turned down the gravity. I'll fix it for you."
3856,ZOIDBERG,Give me that.  More weight!
3857,FRY,"Hey, Dr. Zoidberg, what's that jazz on your head?"
3858,ZOIDBERG,Enough with the questions. More weight! More!  More!
3859,LEELA,Maybe you could do more rips with less weight.
3860,BENDER,"Hey, looks like Zoidberg's finally coming out of his shell.  Get it?  He's coming out--"
3861,RANDY,"Nice and gentle, we don't want any unnecessary stress.  Is there a doctor in the gym?"
3862,ZOIDBERG,I'm a doctor!
3863,LEELA,I wonder why Dr. Zoidberg is acting this way. Out of all of us he always seemed the most normal.
3864,ZOIDBERG,"I am normal. (sexfully) Amy, take of these rubber bands and I'll show you how normal I am!"
3865,AMY,"Fool me seven times, shame on you. Fool me eight or more times, shame on me."
3866,FRY,Maybe he has a parasite.
3867,HERMES,Maybe he is a parasite!
3868,BENDER,It's always so sad when a friend goes crazy and you have to have a big clam-bake and cook him! Yee-haw!
3869,FARNSWORTH,"Now, now, this won't do. Let me just give old Zoidy a sedative."
3870,ZOIDBERG,"Ah, much better. You can take off these rubber bands now."
3871,AMY,I'll do it.
3872,LEELA,(simultaneously) Stop!
3873,FRY,"(simultaneously) No, Amy!"
3874,BENDER,Moron!
3875,FARNSWORTH,Mm-hm...  Oh-ho!  Aha! There's the problem.
3876,ZOIDBERG,"Give it to me straight, Professor. Is it fin rot? It's fin rot, isn't it? Tell me it's not fin rot!"
3877,FARNSWORTH,"Relax, my chiton-y chum. There's no problem. You're just heavy with male jelly."
3878,LEELA,Bleck!
3879,FARNSWORTH,It must be mating season for Zoidberg's people. A chaotic time when his behaviour is dictated by the tiny brain in his rump.
3880,FRY,Eck!
3881,FARNSWORTH,There's only one thing we can do...
3882,BENDER,I'll get the water boiling!
3883,FARNSWORTH,"...We, by which I mean you, will have to rush him to his ancient homeworld which will shortly erupt in an orgy of invertebrate sex."
3884,FRY,"Oh, baby, I'm there!"
3885,LEELA,"Fry, do you even understand the word ""invertebrate""?"
3886,FRY,"Nope, but that's not the word I'm interested in. (shouting) Uh, no need to pack pants, people. Let's roll!"
3887,AMY,Dr. Zoidberg said I should hold these while he's gone.
3888,BENDER,(from inside) Moron!
3889,DECAPOD MANM #1,"Welcome home, old friend. Just 19 hours until the mating frenzy!"
3890,ZOIDBERG,"Excellent, excellent!"
3891,DECAPOD MAN #1,See you there Doctor--
3892,FRY,"Is that how you say ""Zoidberg""?"
3893,ZOIDBERG,You didn't have to call attention to his speech impediment.
3894,BENDER,"You're looking less nuts, crabby."
3895,ZOIDBERG,"I'm feeling less nuts, thank you, because tomorrow I will be depositing my jelly in the cloacal vents of a female. (sexfully) If you catch my drift."
3896,FRY,Who's the lucky lobsterina?
3897,ZOIDBERG,I don't know yet. But I shall attract one this afternoon with an erotic display.
3898,LEELA,It's amazing that your people can fall in love so fast.
3899,ZOIDBERG,Love? That word is unknown here. I'm simply looking for a female swollen with eggs to accept my genetic material.
3900,FRY,"You and me both, brother!"
3901,ZOIDBERG,"Ah, my old scuttling grounds! Let's pull over."
3902,ZOIDBERG,"I used to hang out here as a larva. It looked so much bigger back then. Who's the tough guy now, Vinnie?"
3903,BENDER,"Look! Outdoor theatre! Let's get tickets. Oh, let's do!"
3904,ZOIDBERG,"No, it's the ceremony of Claw-Plach, where my species fight to the death over matters of honour. Also whether abbreviations count in Scrabble. (angry) They don't!"
3905,FRY,I didn't come here to see any activity involving two guys. Where do you people do your erotic display?
3906,ZOIDBERG,Same place as your species: The beach.
3907,ZOIDBERG,How do I look?
3908,BENDER,Like whale barf.
3909,ZOIDBERG,Then the illusion is complete.
3910,FRY,"Hey, I wonder if these guys are here to watch the erotic display too."
3911,DECAPOD MAN #2,"Aw, yeah! Aw, wow!"
3912,ZOIDBERG,Perfect! This oughta make me stand out. Craw!
3913,FRY,Look how ridiculous they look.
3914,BENDER,"Please, he's no different from the rest of you organisms; Shooting DNA at each other make babies. I find it offensive."
3915,ZOIDBERG,Craw!
3916,DECAPOD WOMAN #1,Keep your jelly away from my eggs!
3917,ZOIDBERG,Craw?!
3918,DECAPOD WOMAN #2,So not interested.
3919,ZOIDBERG,Craw!
3920,DECAPOD WOMAN #3,Hmph. I've heard that line before!
3921,ZOIDBERG,"Cra-- Oh, what's the point?"
3922,LEELA,Why is Zoidberg the only one still alone?
3923,BENDER,"'Cause he's a loser, that's why. He's the lobster equivalent of Fry."
3924,FRY,Hey! I can get any girl I want anytime I want. I'm just too busy.
3925,ZOIDBERG,"Edna?! Edna, it's me, Zoidberg. Remember? From high school?  You used to laugh at me because my face was covered with barnacles!"
3926,EDNA,Zoidberg? Well I didn't know you were back in town. I heard you went off and became a rich doctor.
3927,ZOIDBERG,"I've performed a few mercy killings. So, as long as I'm in town I was wondering if maybe ... craw?"
3928,EDNA,"Oh, gee, yeah, I'm just going through a lot of things right now and-- Look, Zoidberg, I carry more eggs than any other female and I owe it to our race to pick a mate who's stuffed with male jelly. Maybe a rock star."
3929,ZOIDBERG,Or maybe a doctor?
3930,EDNA,"I'm sorry, Zoidberg. You're just an inferior male specimen. Nice seeing you again."
3931,ZOIDBERG,"(crying) No one will ever want to mate with me, not with a puny claw like this. Did you see those other guys? They looked like giant claws with bodies attached."
3932,LEELA,At least you didn't smell as bad as them.
3933,ZOIDBERG,"(crying) You're right, my stink gland is weak. Smell!"
3934,FRY,"Listen, Doc, if you wanna score you gotta fake like you're in love.  Just look her in the eye, start crying and say (fake crying) ""I've never been so happy""."
3935,LEELA,If a guy ever did that to me I'd know it. Wait a second. They've all been doing that to me. Even Sean!
3936,ZOIDBERG,"Hmm, this ""love"" intrigues me. Teach me to fake it."
3937,FRY,"OK, you're on a date. What's the first thing you do?"
3938,ZOIDBERG,Ask her to mate with me.
3939,FRY,No. Tell her she's special.
3940,ZOIDBERG,But she's not. She's merely the female with the largest clutch of eggs.
3941,FRY,"Well, tell her that. And then?"
3942,ZOIDBERG,Then mating.
3943,FRY,No. Make up some feelings and tell her you have them.  Yes?
3944,ZOIDBERG,Is desire to mate a feeling?
3945,FRY,You're not even trying!
3946,ZOIDBERG,It's all so complicated with the flowers and the romance and the lies upon lies.
3947,FRY,"OK, OK, don't worry. The love meister will take you under his wing."
3948,ZOIDBERG,What? Now there's a bird involved?
3949,FRY,"OK, go ahead."
3950,EDNA,"What the--? Dr. Zoidberg, your mating display failed. Why are you trying to talk to me?"
3951,ZOIDBERG,(shouting) I have no idea.
3952,FRY,"(whispering) You just wanna talk, it has nothing to do with mating."
3953,ZOIDBERG,"(shouting) I just wanna talk, it has nothing to do with mating. (whispering) Fry, that doesn't make sense."
3954,EDNA,"Dr. Zoidberg, that doesn't make sense. But OK."
3955,FRY,(whispering) Start with a compliment: Tell her she looks thin.
3956,ZOIDBERG,(shouting) You seem malnourished. Are you suffering from internal parasites?
3957,EDNA,"Why, yes. Thanks for noticing."
3958,FRY,(whispering) Now ask her how her day was.
3959,ZOIDBERG,Why would I wanna know?
3960,FRY,(whispering) You wouldn't. Ask anyway.
3961,ZOIDBERG,(shouting) How was your day?
3962,EDNA,Well first I got up and had a piece of toast. Then I brushed my teeth. Then I went to the store to buy some fish. Then...
3963,ZOIDBERG,"Fry, look what you did, she won't shut up."
3964,FRY,"(whispering) That's normal. Just nod your head and say ""Uh-huh"""
3965,ZOIDBERG,"Uh-huh, uh-huh."
3966,EDNA,"...And then you threw an octopus at my window. You know, Zoidberg, it's crazy but when you talk this way your obvious deficiencies as a male seem ... less obvious. Your genes seem less detrimental.  You even stink more."
3967,ZOIDBERG,Do I ask her to mate now?
3968,FRY,(whispering) Third date!
3969,BENDER,So I returned his artificial heart and ever since then I've been known by the name of Honest Bender.
3970,ZOIDBERG,(reading) I'd like to propose a toast to ... coat check number 84.
3971,FRY,(whispering) Turn it over.
3972,ZOIDBERG,"Oh, Edna! (reading) Of all the slimy, gross crab monsters on this planet, you are apparently the hottest."
3973,BENDER,Oy.
3974,FRY,That's the most beautiful thing I've ever heard.
3975,EDNA,"Yes, well ... excuse me, I've got to powder my mouth flaps."
3976,LEELA,"Uh, me too."
3977,ZOIDBERG,"I'm confused, Fry. I'm feeling a strange new emotion. Is it love when you care about a female for reasons beyond mating?"
3978,FRY,Nope. Must be some weird alien emotion.
3979,LEELA,"Zoidberg said some dumb stuff but he's a nice guy, really. It's just that Fry's been telling him what to say and Fry's a ... do you have idiots on your planet?"
3980,EDNA,Fry? You mean words of such beauty came from the blowhole of that hideous alien?
3981,LEELA,"Yeah ... What? Look, never mind the words. Zoidberg's a doctor. A doctor honey."
3982,EDNA,Hmm.
3983,EDNA,(from inside) Come in.
3984,EDNA,"(sexfully) Hello, Fry. Can I interest you in some surf and turf?"
3985,FRY,No thanks. I just came to tell you that Zoidberg's really great. He's got male jelly coming out the wazoo.
3986,EDNA,"Well that is where it comes out but jelly isn't everything.  I know Zoidberg's magical words were really yours. Teach me to love you, squishy poet from beyond the stars!"
3987,FRY,"Uh, I'm flattered, really. If I was gonna do it with a big, freaky mud bug you'd be way up the list!"
3988,EDNA,"Hush, you romantic fool! Engage your mandibles and kiss me!"
3989,ZOIDBERG,"Edna, I couldn't stand it any longer. I--  (angry) Fry!"
3990,FRY,"Dr. Zoidberg, it's not how it looks."
3991,ZOIDBERG,(angry) Her caviar is on your neck!
3992,FRY,But--
3993,EDNA,"Oh, it's true, Zoidberg. We can't hide it any longer. Fry and I have fallen in love and we're going to mate tomorrow."
3994,FRY,What?!
3995,ZOIDBERG,(angry) Fry!  I challenge you to Claw-Plach!
3996,FRY,English please?
3997,ZOIDBERG,A fight to the death.
3998,EDNA,"And if you survive, we'll make sweet love!"
3999,DECAPOD EMPEROR,The law is clear. Fry and Zoidberg shall fight to the death for the claw of the beautiful Edna.
4000,FRY,But I don't want her!
4001,DECAPOD EMPEROR,"Once invoked, the sacred tradition of Claw-Plach can not be taken back. It is a recent tradition - only 18 years old - but it is a tradition none the less."
4002,ZOIDBERG,"Get ready, Fry. I'm going to rip your swim bladder out and show it to you."
4003,LEELA,"Dr. Zoidberg, this is madness. You're being irrational."
4004,ZOIDBERG,(shouting) Of course I'm being irrational! I'm in love!
4005,LEELA,Aww.
4006,FRY,Leela!
4007,LEELA,"Right, right.  You have to stop this madness."
4008,DECAPOD EMPEROR,"Listen, lady, as you can plainly see I'm a highly desirable male, groaning with jelly. Yet I embrace a life of celibacy in order to uphold our crazy traditions. One of your friends must die."
4009,BENDER,"Fate is cruel and unyielding and what must be must be. (shouting) Takin' all bets! I'm giving 9-2 on Zoidberg, the crab with the jab! The Great Red Hope, come on baby!"
4010,ZOIDBERG,"Fry, it's been years since medical school so remind me: Disembowelling in your species - Fatal or non-fatal?"
4011,FRY,Fatal.
4012,ZOIDBERG,Large bet on myself in round one!
4013,DECAPOD EMPEROR,"Edna, have you anything to say before begins the Claw-Plach?"
4014,EDNA,I do. I just want to say that today I got up and I had a piece of toast. Then I brushed my teeth--
4015,FRY,(shouting) Shut up!
4016,EDNA,"I love you, Fry!"
4017,DECAPOD EMPEROR,"Fry, having guessed what animal I was thinking of, you shall have first choice of weapon.  And you, doctor?"
4018,ZOIDBERG,I choose my own claws! I want the tactile pleasure of chopping him right here in the gonads!
4019,FRY,Shh! Nobody correct him!
4020,BENDER,"Fry, I've never asked you for anything before but if it's not too much trouble, when it comes to the ninth round just let him win."
4021,FRY,But it's a fight to the death!
4022,BENDER,"Oh, so this is suddenly all about you. Sheesh!"
4023,DECAPOD EMPEROR,Please rise for the national anthem.
4024,FRY,Uh-oh.
4025,DECAPOD EMPEROR,(shouting) Let Claw-Plach begin!
4026,FRY,Hey!
4027,BENDER,Ow!
4028,LEELA,"(shouting) Come on, Fry! Die with dignity!"
4029,FRY,Aha!  Oops!
4030,EDNA,(screaming) Nooo! I can't stand to look.
4031,ZOIDBERG,Huh?
4032,BENDER,"Psst, Fry. Take a dive."
4033,CROWD,(chanting) Claw-Plach! Claw-Plach! Claw-Plach! Claw-Plach!  Claw-Plach! Claw-Plach!
4034,FRY,"My fellow fish monsters. Far be it for me to question your stupid civilisation or its dumb customs. But is squeezing each others brains out with a giant nutcracker really going to solve anything? Dr. Zoidberg is my friend. And though a woman has come between us, I say we'll always remain friends. And you know why?  One reason."
4035,FRY,You bastard! I'll kill you! You bastard!
4036,LEELA,Wait! Stop! Everyone is gone.
4037,ZOIDBERG,Edna? Honey?
4038,ZOIDBERG,Edna?
4039,LEELA,Ew!
4040,BENDER,"Oh, my God!"
4041,ZOIDBERG,"The frenzy!  Oh, the greatest experience in life and I missed it."
4042,FRY,"Aw. I'm sorry, Doc."
4043,FRY,"Ow, ow! Ah!"
4044,ZOIDBERG,The frenzy is over. How will I ever get rid of my male jelly now?
4045,FRY,I'll lend you this.
4046,LEELA,Fry!
4047,FRY,"Hey, hey."
4048,BENDER,Shoo! Get away! Hey! What's with the flying jerks?
4049,ZOIDBERG,"They come to feast after the frenzy. Once my species passes on its genes, it dies."
4050,FRY,You mean you have to choose between a life without sex and a gruesome death?
4051,ZOIDBERG,Yes.
4052,FRY,Tough call.
4053,ZOIDBERG,"Well it was nice of you to let me reattach your arm, Fry. Especially after I made a complete eel out of myself."
4054,FRY,No biggie.
4055,ZOIDBERG,"Yes biggie. I learned to feel things I'd never felt before: Love, jealousy, passion for disembowling. I owe it all to you.  There! I pronounce the operation a success."
4056,LEELA,Hooray!
4057,BENDER,Yeah!
4058,FRY,(laughing) Yeah!
4059,ZOIDBERG,"I may not know from emotions but when it comes to medicine, forget about it."
4060,FRY,"I don't mean to nitpick, super-doc, but do you think maybe you could take one more whack at this?"
4061,ZOIDBERG,"For you, my friend, anything."
4062,FRY,(from ship) My legs!
4063,ZOIDBERG,"(from ship) Alright, alright, third time's the charm."
4064,FUTURAMA,
4065,"""PUT YOUR HEAD ON MY SHOULDER""",
4066,LINCOLN,Four score and 1145 years ago our forefather's foreheads conceived a new nation.
4067,WASHINGTON,And this Presidents' Day we honoureth those values that my body fought and died for.
4068,MALFUNCTIONING EDDIE,"Values like this brand new Plymouth V'Ger! Hi, I'm Malfunctioning Eddie and I'm malfunctioning so badly I'm practically giving these cars away!"
4069,AMY,"Hey, let's go car shopping! My parents promised if I got all B's they'd buy me a bar. And I got all C's!"
4070,BENDER,Mind if I tag along? I gotta bring my ass in for servicing.  The recall notice says it could burst into flames in a low-speed collision.
4071,FRY,No wonder you've been staying at the back of conga lines lately.
4072,LEELA,"I'll get my coat. Let's go, Bender."
4073,VICTOR,"Hello, I am Victor and I know many things about the art of unloading fine cars on beautiful women."
4074,LEELA,Uh-huh. Now tell us she's witty and sophisticated.
4075,VICTOR,"Ah-ah-ah! A gentleman always sells a lady a car first.  This is the Beta Romeo. Yes, the Beta Romeo. Note the cross-your-heart seat belt which protects, lifts and separates."
4076,SALESMAN,"Spotted her the minute you walked in, didn't you, sir? She's a real beauty."
4077,FRY,"Yup, she's beautiful coffee alright."
4078,SALESMAN,"No, the Ford Thundercougarfalconbird! Nothing makes you feel more like a man than a Thundercougarfalconbird. So how much were you thinking of spending on this Thundercougarfalconbird?"
4079,FRY,"Sorry, I'm not here to buy."
4080,SALESMAN,I understand and it's wonderful you don't care whether anyone questions your sexual orientation.
4081,FRY,I care! I care plenty! I just don't know how to make them stop!
4082,SALESMAN,One word: Thundercougarfalconbird!
4083,VICTOR,"The luxurious seats are stuffed with eagle down and the dashboard inlaid with the beaks of a thousand eagles. Also, there are some eagles under the floorboards."
4084,AMY,That's an awful lot of eagle.
4085,VICTOR,"Yes, and yet--"
4086,AMY,What's wrong?
4087,VICTOR,"It is just, the luxury edition has so much more eagle. It saddens me to think of you missing out."
4088,AMY,"Oh, don't be sad. My parents are paying and they're incredibly rich."
4089,MECHANIC,I installed shock-absorbing bumpers to reduce the risk of catastrophic butt failure.
4090,BENDER,"You, sir, have defaced a national treasure! I demand you restore my buttocks to their former glory."
4091,MECHANIC,"Alright. But sooner or later that ass is gonna blow. And when it does, I just pray you're not moonin' someone you care about."
4092,AMY,"Smeesh, Leela! This car has everything a beautiful woman like me needs. Victor said so."
4093,VICTOR,(to himself) No dog food for Victor tonight.
4094,LEELA,"OK, the sticker says 55,000 but we'll only go as high as say--"
4095,AMY,"60,000!"
4096,VICTOR,"Oh, I will have to ask my manager."
4097,LEELA,"Amy, you don't go up from the sticker price."
4098,AMY,I thought it was an auction.
4099,VICTOR,He is not too happy.
4100,AMY,"I'm sorry. 80,000?"
4101,AMY,Uh-oh. I'm terrible at parallel parking.
4102,HERMES,(from inside) And now you're asking for a day off? Get out of my and my sight!  You're bogarting my patience.
4103,LEELA,Hermes. Who were you yelling at?
4104,HERMES,Myself. I asked myself a Valentine's Day off. But I was in no mood for any of my shenanigans.
4105,FRY,"Valentine's Day's coming? Oh, crap! I forgot to get a girlfriend again. Well since neither of us has a date, why don't we..."
4106,LEELA,You just assume I can't get a Valentine's date?
4107,FRY,Shall we say 8 o'clock?
4108,AMY,"Hey, I'm taking my new car out for a spin to Mercury. Anybody wanna come?"
4109,FRY,"Yeah, OK. What's the weather like?"
4110,AMY,"The usual: Boiling lead, oceans of lava."
4111,FRY,"So, what? Shorts?"
4112,FRY,"Boy, this A.C. is incredible!  I'd better turn on the heater too.  (shouting) Boy, this heater is incredible! I'd better turn up the A.C. some more."
4113,AMY,"(shouting) Hey, how about some icy margaritas?"
4114,FRY,(shouting) Yeah!  We're slowing down!
4115,AMY,(shouting) Don't worry. I'll hit the fuel guzzler!
4116,FRY,(shouting) Who wants pop-tarts?  Uh-oh!
4117,AMY,"It's OK, I have an emergency phone."
4118,FRY,What are you doing?
4119,AMY,Spluh! It's a video-phone.  Lucky I'm a member of the Astro-Afro-Antarctico-Amer-Asian Auto Association.  Hello? Septuple-A?
4120,FRY,Phew!
4121,AMY,"It'll be a couple hours. Oh, I'm gonna get sweat on my sweat-suit."
4122,FRY,"Hey, tell me something: You've got all this money, how come you always dress like you're doing your laundry?"
4123,AMY,I guess 'cause my parents keep telling me to be more ladylike.  As though!
4124,FRY,"I've been there. My folks were always on me to groom myself and wear underpants. What am I, the Pope?"
4125,AMY,"Yeah, and if you were the Pope they'd be all, ""Straighten your Pope hat,"" and, ""Put on your good vestments"". You know, Fry, its nice to find someone I can talk to about stuff, and junk."
4126,FRY,"Yeah, it's like we feel the same way about junk and stuff, or, whatever."
4127,AMY,"So while they're towin' us, you wanna do it?"
4128,FRY,Yeah.
4129,HERMES,"Which concludes the summary of the movie I saw last night. Now, any old business? Any new business?  Anyone spend the night together?"
4130,AMY,Yep.
4131,FRY,Kind of.
4132,BENDER,What?
4133,HERMES,"Oh, my God!"
4134,AMY,We ran out of fuel on Mercury and one thing led to another.
4135,FRY,And it led there again when we got home.
4136,BENDER,"Congratulations, Fry, you snagged the perfect girlfriend. Amy's rich, she's probably got other characteristics."
4137,LEELA,Bender! Romance isn't about money.
4138,BENDER,"Oh, so it's just coincidence that Zoidberg here is desperately poor and miserably lonely? Puh-lease!"
4139,LEELA,"For your information, it's because he's hideous."
4140,HERMES,Well I think Amy and Fry go together like a lime and coconut.
4141,FARNSWORTH,Do I hear wedding bells?
4142,FRY,What? No!
4143,FARNSWORTH,"Really? Oh, dear."
4144,ZOIDBERG,You're both very lucky. I'd pay anything to end my miserable loneliness. If only I weren't so desperately poor.
4145,BENDER,Wait. You mean people will pay good money for romance? Hmm. I think I have a scheme so deviously clever that I--
4146,JUDGE,$500 and time served.
4147,BENDER,"Stupid anti-pimping laws.  Well, pay the man!"
4148,HOOKERBOT,"Bender, honey, we love you!"
4149,BENDER,"Shut up, baby, I know it!"
4150,BENDER,"Ah, computer dating. It's like pimping but you rarely have to use the phrase ""upside your head""."
4151,LEELA,"Bender, this is stupid. Why would anyone come to you for romantic help?"
4152,BENDER,Hey! Don't make me go upside your head!
4153,HERMES,(shouting) Fry! Amy! Put your pants back on; I need a stapler.
4154,ZOIDBERG,Stop! Stop! If you interrupt the mating dance the male will become enraged and maul us with his fearsome gonad.
4155,FRY,"(whispering) It's working, they think we're making out.  Wait, why aren't we making out?"
4156,AMY,I 'unno.
4157,BENDER,"OK, Mister...?"
4158,ZAPP,"Uh, Smith! Zapp Smith. Uh, Brannigan."
4159,BENDER,Just check off the things you're looking for in a love partner.
4160,ZAPP,"Let's see ... Oh, yes!  Yes, definitely. Oh, I'd like some of that.  Mmm, I'll just have everything on the menu."
4161,BENDER,Now to run it through our high speed romance-a-logical data-fier.  Say hello to Miss Right!
4162,ZAPP,(sexfully) Hello!
4163,FRY,Wow! We're great kissers!
4164,AMY,"Yeah! Hey, later, you wanna drive out to Europa? We could have a picnic and spit watermelon seeds at Jupiter."
4165,FRY,"Hey, yeah! I used to spit at stuff back in the 20th century. Ah, it's cool how we sort of think exactly alike, and junk."
4166,AMY,"Yeah. Y'know, Fry, I really like hanging out with you."
4167,FRY,"Everything was going great. Then all of a sudden, she's talking about hanging out. Hangin out? She's getting way too serious. I'm not a one woman man, Leela."
4168,LEELA,You'll be back to zero soon enough.
4169,FRY,Don't you get it? She's smothering me.
4170,AMY,Hi.
4171,FRY,You see? You see? Now she's bothering me when I'm at work.
4172,LEELA,Fry--!
4173,FRY,I'm doing my job -- there's Amy. I spend a few hours selecting a candy from the machine -- there's Amy. I wake up the morning after sleeping with Amy -- there's Amy!
4174,LEELA,I think you're over reacting.
4175,FRY,"Am I? (shouting) Am I? (talking) Face it, I'm a prize catch.  I mean, I'm pulling down delivery boy money."
4176,LEELA,"Fry, she's pulling down billionaire trust-fund money."
4177,FRY,"Then she wants me as a trophy husband. Leela, you gotta come to Europa with us, I can't be alone with her."
4178,AMY,"So, ready for a secluded picnic with just you and me?"
4179,FRY,"Hey, you know who loves secluded picnics with just you and me?  Uh, Dr. Zoidberg."
4180,ZOIDBERG,Did someone say something about a free hot meal?
4181,ZOIDBERG,"Mmm, I haven't eaten since Tuesday! Bird eggs, animal slices ...  ... dry woven reeds!  All gone! Can I drive?"
4182,AMY,"No. So, Fry, you busy tomorrow? I got two tickets to the big ape fight."
4183,FRY,"Jeez, we're already planning to spend Valentine's Day together. Isn't that enough?"
4184,AMY,"OK, sure. What do you wanna do for Valentine's Day?"
4185,FRY,"Oh, so all of a sudden we're spending Valentine's Day together?"
4186,AMY,But you just said--
4187,FRY,"That's it, Amy, we have to talk. Zoidberg, you drive."
4188,ZOIDBERG,Wahoo!
4189,FRY,"(from inside) Pardon me, excuse me."
4190,ZOIDBERG,"Ah, I'll just turn the wheel to maximum fastness!"
4191,FRY,"Amy, you know how at first you like chocolate but then you start to get tired of it because it always wants to hang out with you?"
4192,AMY,Huh? You don't like chocolate?
4193,FRY,"Look, could chocolate just let me finish?"
4194,ZOIDBERG,Vroom vroom! And the winner of the big car race is: Hot Rod Zoidberg!
4195,FRY,"Amy, what I'm trying to say is, I think maybe you and I should stop--"
4196,ZOIDBERG,"Uh-oh. Here, you drive!"
4197,ZOIDBERG,Fry? Are you alright?
4198,FRY,Ow! My head is killing me. What happened? Was anybody hurt?
4199,ZOIDBERG,"No, no, no, no, no, of course not. Nobody but you. I'm afraid your body was badly damaged in the crash."
4200,FRY,How badly?
4201,ZOIDBERG,"That's it over there.  Don't worry, I managed to keep your head alive with some quick surgery."
4202,FRY,Where is it?
4203,ZOIDBERG,There.
4204,AMY,"Looks like we'll be spending a lot more time together, Fry!"
4205,LEELA,This sort of thing always happens with office romances.
4206,ZOIDBERG,"Don't worry, Fry, we'll have your body all fixed up in a few days.  Upsy daisy!"
4207,FRY,"Well, Amy, I'll try not to interfere with your life too much."
4208,AMY,Fry!
4209,FRY,"Ooh, sorry. I guess I control that arm."
4210,AMY,"So, what was it you wanted to talk about before we crashed anyway?"
4211,FRY,"Oh, that.  Maybe we'd better talk in private. (whispering) I'll meet you in the closet."
4212,FRY,"Amy, I really like you, as a friend. But I think we're spending too much time together."
4213,AMY,You're breaking up with me?
4214,FRY,I just think we should start seeing other people.
4215,AMY,"But, I was really having fun.  If that's how you feel."
4216,FRY,"I'm sorry, but it is."
4217,AMY,"Well, whatever. Hey, listen, as long as we're not seeing each other, you mind if I ask someone else out for Valentine's Day?"
4218,FRY,Huh?
4219,AMY,"I mean, unless it would make you feel bad, being a third wheel."
4220,FRY,"Hey, I can get a date too. Now that I'm single, I'll attract all sorts of women!"
4221,AMY,With my body I think you might only attract one sort of woman.
4222,FRY,(happy) Oh! (disappointed) Oh!
4223,LEELA,"So, how's business?"
4224,BENDER,"Are you familiar with my friend Al Gore? I'm tellin' ya, losers get really desperate around Valentine's Day."
4225,LEELA,"Yeah, it's pathetic alright!  How much?"
4226,BENDER,500 bucks.
4227,LEELA,Done.
4228,BENDER,Zapp Brannigan OK?
4229,LEELA,No!
4230,BENDER,600.
4231,FRY,"Oh, hey, Leela, uh, can I talk to you for a minute?  In private?"
4232,AMY,"Oh, no problem."
4233,FRY,"This is an emergency. Amy made Valentine's plans with some goon and I'm gonna be stuck there, lonely and miserable. Will you be my date, please?"
4234,LEELA,"You're too late, Fry. I'm sharing Valentine's Day with a very special man. He's not Zapp Brannigan or anything!"
4235,FRY,Then I have no choice but to do something so pitiful and embarrassing that I'm ashamed to tell you about it.
4236,LEELA,Bender's in his office.
4237,FRY,Thanks.
4238,BENDER,"I got your hook-up, Fry. Now my usual fee's 500 bucks, but seeing as how it's you, I'll need it in advance."
4239,AMY,"OK, Fry, we're done putting on the bra."
4240,FRY,Why exactly did you shave your legs anyway? Are you expecting something to happen with your Valentine's date?
4241,AMY,What business is it of yours?
4242,FRY,And another thing: You're using an awful lot of make-up there.
4243,AMY,This is deodorant.
4244,FRY,What does it do?
4245,AMY,"(shouting) C'mon in, Gary! I'll just be another 20 minutes."
4246,GARY,(from outside) I'll be waiting.
4247,FRY,20 minutes? You're practically ready now!
4248,AMY,"Yeah, but it's good to make them wait a little."
4249,FRY,"Oh, God, it's true!"
4250,GARY,That dress looks great on you.
4251,AMY,(simultaneously) Thanks.
4252,FRY,(simultaneously) Thanks.  Where is she?
4253,GARY,"I must say, Amy, you're all made up, just like Fry's date. Get it?"
4254,AMY,Mm-mm.
4255,FRY,I've got a date. She'll be along any minute.
4256,BENDER,"Fry, look who I found! It's Petunia, your dream girl!"
4257,PETUNIA,How's them eats?
4258,FRY,Uh--
4259,PETUNIA,Don't mind if I do.  Kids'll be hungry.
4260,FRY,(whispering) She seems a little old for me.
4261,BENDER,She is well-travelled. And I don't mean she travels a lot!
4262,PETUNIA,Wheels fell off my house.
4263,BENDER,Now how about a rose for the lady? Five bucks a pop!
4264,GARY,I'll take one.
4265,FRY,"Oh, yeah? Well I want one too."
4266,BENDER,Eight bucks.
4267,FRY,But you just said--
4268,BENDER,"Demand suddenly skyrocketed, you all saw it."
4269,BENDER,"Leela, meets your future husband Sal."
4270,SAL,"Nice eyeball, eyeball."
4271,LEELA,"Nice ass, ass."
4272,BENDER,"Ooh, sparks! (whispering) Buy her a rose, I guarantee she'll put out!"
4273,SAL,"Eh, I'll take my chances."
4274,ZAPP,Cheers!
4275,"""WOMAN""",Cheers!
4276,PETUNIA,So tell me about your prospects. You a good gambler?
4277,FRY,"Well, ma'am I--"
4278,PETUNIA,What's your game? Bingo? Keno? Wait a minute! You don't have your own body.
4279,FRY,"No, but I control this arm."
4280,PETUNIA,"Slots player, huh? Sorry, but I think I can do better."
4281,FRY,"Wait, come back, uh, darling."
4282,PETUNIA,"Can't, hon. I gotta catch my bus back to Nutley. I'd kiss you goodnight but I lost my teeth pulling out a stump."
4283,SAL,"So anyways, Leela, I'd love to take a whack at ya but that 10:15 to Nutley ain't goin' nowheres without yours truly behinds the wheel."
4284,PETUNIA,"Excuse me, did you say ""10:15 to Nutley""?"
4285,SAL,"Why, yes I dids."
4286,LEELA,(whispering) Bender! Did you just round up our dates at the bus station?
4287,BENDER,Of course not.
4288,SAL,Anybodys else for Nutley?
4289,ZAPP,"Baby, wait! You didn't show me your surprise."
4290,GARY,(whispering) You know what I'd like to do...?
4291,FRY,"Oh, jeez, get a room!"
4292,GARY,Maybe later.
4293,FRY,"Hey, I have an idea: Let's all go out for ice cream."
4294,GARY,"Actually, I thought Amy might like to come back to my place for coffee."
4295,AMY,I don't really like coffee.
4296,GARY,Neither do I.
4297,AMY,"Ooh, I feel a little tipsy!"
4298,GARY,Let me pick up the check.
4299,FRY,Nooo!  That's it I'm gettin' the hell outta here.  Ooh! Ow!
4300,LEELA,"Why, if it isn't my favourite head on Amy's body: Fry."
4301,FRY,"Oh, Leela!"
4302,AMY,We were just on our way out.
4303,LEELA,"Nonsense, the evening's young. So, Gary, what do you do for a living?"
4304,GARY,I'm a banking industry regulator.
4305,LEELA,Really? Y'know I heard that banking industry regulations are really very simple.
4306,GARY,"Oh, no, that's not true. You see, modern banking regulations are a product of five different regulatory traditions. Six if you wanna get technical."
4307,LEELA,"Oh, I do."
4308,GARY,It all began in 1410 when a number of noblemen convened...
4309,FRY (WHISPERING),Thank you.
4310,ZOIDBERG,"There you are, good as new. Except for your dorsal fin, I'm afraid I couldn't find it after the crash."
4311,FRY,Can I live without it?
4312,ZOIDBERG,If you call that living.
4313,FARNSWORTH,I still don't understand why you wouldn't let me graft a laser cannon onto your chest. To crush those who disobey you. But I guess we're just two different people.
4314,FRY,"So, uh, thanks for the ride, Amy. And I hope there are no hard feelings about your date, or stuff."
4315,AMY,"It's OK, I had fun. And if I ever feel lonely I can just look over at this disfiguring scar and think of you."
4316,FRY,"Well, anyway, it's nice to have my own body back."
4317,LEELA,So how's the old corpse? Everything hooked up OK?
4318,FRY,"Seems to be. My neck's just a little tender.  Ow! Cool!  Ow! Listen, Leela. Thanks for rescuing me last night."
4319,LEELA,Anytime. I actually enjoyed hanging out with you.
4320,BENDER,"Yep, everything worked out great thanks to good old Bender."
4321,LEELA,Come on! It's not like you intentionally set us up with bad dates so we'd spend Valentine's Day together.
4322,BENDER,"Didn't I, Leela? Didn't I?"
4323,LEELA,No! You didn't! You just corralled a bunch of stiffs at the bus station and pocketed our money!
4324,BENDER,"True. But in the end, isn't that what Valentine's Day is really all about?"
4325,LEELA,Yeah.
4326,FRY,I guess so.  Watch the neck! Watch the neck!
4327,BENDER,My ass! My beautiful ass!

4354,LEELA,But Bender you are -
4355,BENDER,Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah...
4356,FRY,"Cool, it's just like the good old days!"
4357,MUGGER,Give me your wallet or I'll cut you!
4358,FRY,"Hey Leela, get a picture of me being ""mugged."""
4359,MUGGER,I'll take the camera too.
4360,BENDER,Learning is fun.
4361,LEELA,"Ooo, ancient Wall Street."
4362,STOCKBROKER #1,No!
4363,STOCKBROKER #2,I'm ruined!
4364,TOUR GUIDE,I direct your attention to this ancient and mysterious tablet which has yet to be deciphered.
4365,LEELA,Do you know what it means?
4366,FRY,"Yeah I asked a cop once. It means ""Up yours kid."""
4367,BENDER,"I gotta say I'm really enjoying the day out with you people - Hey, a suicide booth! So long suckers."
4368,FRY,"Uh, sorry Bender that's just a phone booth."
4369,BENDER,(disappointed) Oh.
4370,LEELA,What were they used for?
4371,FRY,In New York? Bathrooms.
4372,LEELA,Oh. I-I'll be out in a sec.
4373,LEELA,(reading) Tokens only. (talking) How does this work?
4374,FRY,I'll show you.  Whup.
4375,BENDER,"Ohh, it's a turnstile."
4376,LEELA,What's this?  Another bathroom?
4377,FRY,"No, it's a mobile apartment with no rent."
4378,BENDER,C'mon Fry get up!
4379,LEELA,Wow! The burial chamber of the 20th century's greatest spiritual leader - Al Sharpton.
4380,BENDER,Wow. Now this guy had taste!
4381,LEELA,It says he was mummified in ceremonial vestments.
4382,FRY,We sometimes called it a jogging suit.
4383,NARRATOR,(voice-over) They traffic jams of Old New York were a public forum of free interchange of opinions.
4384,NARRATOR,"(voice-over) It all started with Gerald Ford's famous invention, the ""automocar"" ......which was powered by a tank of burning fossils. Here we see a 20th century assembly line where cars were constructed by primative robots."
4385,ROBOTS,(chanting) Ooga ooga ooga ooga ooga ooga...
4386,BENDER,We've come a long way baby!
4387,NARRATOR,(voice-over) The fruit of the robots' labour was this......the stately 1992 Latoura.
4388,FRY,"Hey, my girlfriend had one of those! Actually it wasn't her's it was her dad's. Actually she wasn't my girlfriend. She just lived next door and never closed her curtains."
4389,LEELA,"Fry, remember when I told you about always ending your stories a sentence earlier?"
4390,FRY,"C'mon, let's sneak in for a closer look."
4391,MAN,"Sir, we don't touch the antiques sir. You - oh!  I'm sorry. You work here. I should have realised from that ridiculous getup you're wearing."
4392,FRY,"Hey! This is from Miller's Outpo - uh, I mean, yeah, I work here alright!"
4393,MAN,"Here, move this rust bucket outside behind Saint Koch's cathedral."
4394,LEELA,Did you drive much in the 20th century Fry?
4395,FRY,Nope.  No one in New York drove. There was too much traffic.  Nice! Listen to that baby purr!
4396,BENDER,There's a baby in there huh?
4397,FRY,It's just like riding a bicyc -
4398,BENDER,I think I got whiplash.
4399,LEELA,"You can't have whiplash, you don't have a neck."
4400,BENDER,I meant ass whiplash.
4401,FRY,I'm just glad we hit something. I thought we'd never stop.
4402,BENDING UNIT,Ow! I think I got whiplash.
4403,FRY,How's that robot I ran over?
4404,FARNSWORTH,We did all we could.
4405,FRY,You mean he's -
4406,FARNSWORTH,Good as new? Yes.
4407,FARNSWORTH,"Leela, Zoidberg, the rest of you, this is Flexo."
4408,HERMES,"Sweet llamas of the Bahamas! Except for that stylish beard, he looks just like Bender!"
4409,FLEXO,"No duh dreadlock, we're both bending units."
4410,BENDER,"Hey brobot, what's you serial number?"
4411,FLEXO,3370318.
4412,BENDER,No way! Mine's 2716057!
4413,FRY,I don't get it.
4414,BENDER,We're both expressable as the sum of two cubes.
4415,FRY,"So uh, Flexo. Sorry about crushing your body like that. You OK now?"
4416,FLEXO,"Well I don't feel as bad as you look! Nah I'm just messing with you kid. You're alright. That's some face you got though, I think they got a cream for that.  Nah, you're great."
4417,FRY,Well just let me know if there's anything I can do to make it up to you.
4418,FLEXO,Actually your little stunt did a number on my back. You mind rubbin' it for me?
4419,FRY,Uh...sure.
4420,FLEXO,"Aw yeah, that's it. A little lower."
4421,FRY,How's that?
4422,FLEXO,Lower. Yeah that's it. A little lower though.
4423,FRY,Uh I can't get any lower than this.
4424,FLEXO,"I'll say, you're rubbing my ass!"
4425,ROBOT #1,"Hey, check it out here, six beautiful devices. They know what you like and they'll do it to within a tolerance of one micron!"
4426,ROBOT #2,Yeah spin those fans baby!
4427,ROBOT #3,Alright mama!
4428,ROBOT #4,Gyrate baby!
4429,FRY,I don't like this place. It's 120 degrees and there's very little oxygen.
4430,BENDER,"Shut up and hoot.  Hubba-hubba, she is built! In Mexico I believe."
4431,FLEXO,And that ain't silicon. It's tungsten - and plenty of it!
4432,FRY,"(unsure) Uh, yeah. Look at that exhaust fan."
4433,FLEXO,Eww!
4434,BENDER,Pervert.
4435,FLEXO,Yoo-hoo!
4436,STRIPPERBOT,Thanks moderate spender. Please select erotic transaction.
4437,FLEXO,"Yeah, how 'bout a lapdance for my pal here?"
4438,FRY,"Uh, no, that's alright.  Ow! Ow!"
4439,FRY,I'm telling you there's something about Flexo I don't like.
4440,FLEXO,"Hey Fry, think fast.  Get it? It's chlorine!"
4441,ZOIDBERG,It's funny because it's poisonous!
4442,FRY,Yeah keep laughing brineshrimp but he's bad news. I regret ever running him over.
4443,HERMES,Take a rage dump man. He's no worse than Bender.
4444,FRY,"He's much worse. He drinks, he smokes and he posts naked pictures of me on the internet."
4445,AMY,That's Bender alright.
4446,FRY,I'm talking about Flexo.
4447,LEELA,"Oh I get it, this is cute. You're jealous of Bender's new friend!"
4448,FRY,No I'm not. Mark my words. Flexo's evil. He's the evil Bender.
4449,HERMES,Rage dump!
4450,FARNSWORTH,Everyone get in bed with me. I have something to show you.  Feast your eyes on this!
4451,LEELA,It's beautiful.
4452,AMY,And huge.
4453,FRY,Can I touch it?
4454,ZOIDBERG,So what is it already?
4455,FARNSWORTH,"It's a single atom of jumbonium. And element so rare, the nucleus alone is worth more than $50,000."
4456,BENDER,How much more?
4457,FARNSWORTH,"100,000. That's why I hid it here. Under my mattress."
4458,LEELA,"Uh Professor, can we discuss this somewhere else?"
4459,FARNSWORTH,Why certainly.
4460,FARNSWORTH,"The atom sits atop this dime stored tiara which will be awarded to the winner of this years Miss Universe pageant on the planet Tova 9.  Your job is to deliver it, safe and sound."
4461,AMY,"Wow, when I was a little girl on Mars I dreamed of being Miss Universe."
4462,LEELA,That's kinda pathetic.
4463,AMY,Aw come on Leela. Deep down all girls wanna be Miss Universe.
4464,LEELA,Not me.
4465,AMY,Really? Maybe it's just cute girls.
4466,FARNSWORTH,"Due to the atom's tremendous value, Planet Express would go bankrupt if it was stolen. Therefore we'll need to hire on additional security for the mission."
4467,FLEXO,"Oh oh Mr Professor, right here!"
4468,FRY,"Uh, maybe we should stick with people we know and trust. I mean, Flexo's great but -"
4469,FARNSWORTH,Flexo's great you say? Well that's good enough for me.  Welcome aboard lad.
4470,LEELA,"Space banditos have been operating in this quadrant so you'll each take 8-hour shifts guarding the safe. First Bender, then Flexo, then Fry."
4471,FRY,"Wait, I don't like the sound of that. Let's just go alphabetically."
4472,LEELA,"OK. First Bender, then Flexo, then Fry."
4473,FRY,"Wait, let's go by rank."
4474,LEELA,"OK. First Bender, then Flexo, then Fry."
4475,FRY,Flexo outranks me?
4476,FLEXO,"That's ""Flexo outranks me, sir""!"
4477,BENDER,Halt. Who goes there?
4478,FRY,Don't point that at me.
4479,BENDER,Fry who?
4480,FRY,"Look, I know Flexo's your friend but I don't trust him alone with the atom."
4481,BENDER,"My God Fry just 'cause the guy's got a beard you label him as evil? Well I got a label for you pal. An ugly little word called ""prejudice."""
4482,FRY,I'm not prejudiced.
4483,BENDER,Ah save it for the cross burning Adolf!
4484,FLEXO,Keeping an eye on the safe?
4485,BENDER,You know it!
4486,FLEXO,"Well, looks like it's my shift. You lie down and go offline for a while."
4487,BENDER,Alright.
4488,FRY,Caught you!  I saw you looking at the atom!
4489,FLEXO,So? I look at lots of atoms. Shouldn't you be resting up for your shift?
4490,FRY,Oh-ho you'd like it if I went to sleep wouldn't you?
4491,FLEXO,"Whatever it takes to shut your yapper. Nah, I'm just kidding you, you're a joker."
4492,FRY,Yeah well here's a funny joke. I'm gonna sit right here till it's my shift.
4493,FLEXO,Suit yourself skinbag.
4494,FRY,That I will.
4495,FLEXO,Good.
4496,FRY,Good.
4497,FLEXO,Good.
4498,FRY,Good.
4499,FLEXO,Good.
4500,FRY,Good.  Good.
4501,FRY,"Well, that's eight hours."
4502,FLEXO,"Yeah eight hours of solid boredom. Nah, I'm kidding, you're a wonderful man."
4503,FRY,"Finally, the atom is safe."
4504,LEELA,What is it?  My God! Did you hear maracas?
4505,FRY,No.
4506,LEELA,"Then it wasn't space banditos.  Bender, lock down the ship, don't let Flexo escape."
4507,BENDER,Aye aye captain. It appears that Flexo has outwitted us all. Especially me...Bender.
4508,LEELA,How could Flexo have stolen the atom?
4509,FRY,He must have used a sleep ray on me. Sleep rays exist in the future right?
4510,LEELA,No.
4511,FRY,Then I must've fallen asleep.
4512,LEELA,Well you were sure right about Flexo being evil.
4513,BENDER,I locked down the ship but he may have already gotten away.
4514,LEELA,"OK, thanks Bender. Let's fan out and look for him."
4515,BENDER,"Roger that, I got a map of the ship right here."
4516,LEELA,(whispering) Keep an eye on Fry. We can't rule out the possibility that he did it.
4517,LEELA,Aha!
4518,FRY,Aha!  Uh searching...hmm.
4519,LEELA,Fry? Why are you looking for Flexo in my underpants drawer?
4520,FRY,I didn't find him here 10 minutes ago so I thought it was time to check again.
4521,BENDER,"Well, he wasn't in the uh, kitchen room."
4522,FRY,"(suspicious) Say Bender, can I hold that map for a second?"
4523,BENDER,Any leave me high and dry in case of a scavenger hunt? I think not.
4524,FRY,Give it up!
4525,BENDER,"Alright, take it. Sheesh."
4526,LEELA,"Well, looks like Flexo got away clean."
4527,BENDER,It's a darn shame.
4528,LEELA,He must have jumped ship with the atom the second we landed.
4529,FRY,"Or maybe, he never left at all!  Wait a minute. You're Bender."
4530,BENDER,"Of course, who said I wasn't?"
4531,FRY,"But why were you wearing that scarf, that turtleneck and this fruity number?"
4532,BENDER,"It's a little thing called ""style."" Look it up sometime."
4533,BARKER,"Our ninth finalist, Miss Methane Planet; Halatina Smogmeyer.  And our tenth and final finalist, Miss Earth's Moon, the Crushinator."
4534,CRUSHINATOR,"(mechanical voice) Thank you Bob Barker, I'm as happy as a girl can be. End statement."
4535,BARKER,Which one of these lovely womanoids will take home the lovely tiara?
4536,LEELA,(whispering) Downplay the tiara.
4537,BARKER,"Uh, we'll find out after these subliminal messages."
4538,BARKER,"So you lost the atom huh? You're garbage, human garbage! Do you braindead space jockeys have any idea how much that thing is worth?"
4539,FRY,"100,000?"
4540,LEELA,"200,000?"
4541,BENDER,"200,001?"
4542,BARKER,You're closest without going over.
4543,FRY,"Well, we'll be leaving now. If you'll just sign this form saying you received the atom."
4544,BARKER,I'm not signing squat. You find me that damn tiara before the pageant ends.
4545,LEELA,But Mr Barker -
4546,BARKER,"Enough out of you. I may be against the fur industry, but that won't stop me from skinning you alive! As long as no one wears the skin."
4547,LEELA,"Well gentlemen, it appears we're boned."
4548,FRY,Flexo!
4549,LEELA,Get him!
4550,BARKER,"Next up in what is generously called the ""Talent Competition,"" performing a traditional gangster rap, Miss - what the?"
4551,BENDER,Got you!
4552,WOMEN,(chanting) Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!
4553,BENDER,"Shoot him, he's choking me!"
4554,FLEXO,"No shoot him, he's choking me!"
4555,LEELA,I don't know which one to shoot.
4556,FRY,Flexo! Shoot Flexo!
4557,AMAZONIAN,Women only room!
4558,LEELA,"Alright, enough of this.  There's the atom!"
4559,BENDER,Aw jeez.
4560,FRY,Bender? You stole the atom?
4561,BENDER,"Yeah but I can explain, it's very valuable."
4562,FLEXO,I saw him snatch it while Fry was asleep. That's why I ran to tell Bob Barker.
4563,FRY,"Whoa whoa, you mean Bender is the evil Bender? I am shocked, shocked! Well not that shocked."
4564,LEELA,"I'm sorry we suspected you Flexo. It's just, what with the beard and all."
4565,FLEXO,"Don't even bother. You people sicken me. I put my life on the line to guard that atom and this is how you repay me? Well you can go rot for all I care. Nah, I'm just kidding, you guys are alright."
4566,FRY,I'm so confused. The Bender I liked turn out to be evil and the Bender I hated was good. How can I live my life when I can't tell good from evil?
4567,BENDER,"Eh, they're both fine choices, whatever floats your boat."
4568,URL,Is this the guy?
4569,BARKER,"Huh? Oh yeah, that looks like him. Whatever."
4570,FLEXO,"Wait, but I -"
4571,BARKER,Take him away.
4572,BARKER,"Alright, let's put an end to this pathetic hoedown. Brannigan read the thing."
4573,ZAPP,And the winner is...
4574,LEELA,"It figures. Who else but Zapp Brannigan would be judging the most chauvinistic, degrading, dehumanising -"
4575,ZAPP,Huh? Leela?
4576,LEELA,"Wait, you're making a -  Ooo! Look at that.  I feel like a princess."
4577,ZAPP,"Wait. What are you people, idiots? I'm still going mano a mano with this envelope. Miss Vega 4.  (singing) There it is, Miss Universe. There it is, looking weird."
4578,LEELA,I almost had that tiara.
4579,BENDER,Me too.
4580,FRY,"Well, you guys might both be losers but I just made out with that radiator woman from the radiator planet."
4581,LEELA,"Fry, that's a radiator."
4582,FRY,Oh.  Is there a burn ward within 10 feet of here?
4583,THE END,
4584,"""RAGING BENDER""",
4585,FARNSWORTH,"Good news, everyone. I've taught the toaster to feel love.  And Hermes returns from his vacation today."
4586,HERMES,"(monotonous) Good morning, people."
4587,FRY,"Hey, Hermes!"
4588,ZOIDBERG,Hello!
4589,LEELA,Good to see you.
4590,FARNSWORTH,Yo!
4591,BENDER,My man!
4592,AMY,So how was the Spleef Nebula?
4593,HERMES,(monotonous) The flight had a stopover on the Brain Slug planet. Hermes liked it so much he decided to stay of his own free will.
4594,FRY,Hermes has all the fun. Wait a second! He's got a Brain Slug on his head!
4595,LEELA,(whispering) Shh! You're gonna get us all assimilated!
4596,AMY,(whispering) Just act normal and switch to a garlic shampoo.
4597,HERMES,(monotonous) On to new business. Today's mission is for all of you to go to the Brain Slug planet.
4598,ZOIDBERG,What are we going to do there?
4599,HERMES,(monotonous) Just walk around not wearing a helmet.
4600,FARNSWORTH,"Sounds great, Hermes! Whatever you say. (whispering) Let's ditch him and go to the movies!"
4601,FRY,"Hey, yeah!"
4602,ZOIDBERG,I'm seeing a movie with friends!
4603,FRY,"Cool, let's see this one!"
4604,LEELA,"Nah. I'm not in the mood for a historical documentary. I've heard good things about Quizblorg, Quizblorg."
4605,AMY,Guk! I hate subtitles. Alien films are so pretentious.
4606,ZOIDBERG,Fellows! Fellows! How about a film we can all enjoy? Planet Of The Clams. It's about an upside-down world where lobster is slave to clam.
4607,BENDER,Who invited you? Let's just see All My Circuits: The Movie.
4608,FRY,"Yeah, I wanna see that."
4609,BENDER,"Good point, Bender."
4610,FRY,I'll take a small Slurm.
4611,REFRESHMENT-BOT,"For only 25 cents less, you can get a super-small."
4612,FRY,"Uh, OK.  Oh, man!"
4613,BENDER,"Hey, gimmie a large diet malt liquor and a popcorn with extra motor oil."
4614,FARNSWORTH,Down in front!
4615,ANNOUNCER,Glagnar's Human Rinds presents: This Week In The Universe.
4616,FRY,"(sarcastic) Ooh, this is real futuristic!"
4617,CROW T. ROBOT,Shh! Don't talk during the movie.
4618,ANNOUNCER,"This week in the universe: New New York mayor C. Randall Poopenmeyer opens a new tube line to alleviate rush hour traffic.  Dateline: Paramecium Homeworld. Newly-crowned Miss Universe Glady's Lennox entertains troops fighting to wipe out the human race.  Go get 'em, boys!  And in the world of Ultimate Robot Fighting, the Masked Unit wins his championship bout against Gorgeous Gonks by technical melting."
4619,BENDER,"(shouting) Go Masked Unit!  Uh, hey, buddy! Yo!  You mind taking your head off?"
4620,ROBOT,"I'm sorry, sir, but I need it to watch the movie."
4621,BENDER,Just ask Flabby over here to describe it to you later.
4622,ROBOT,"Sir, she is as the factory made her."
4623,BENDER,Well they should have stopped making her about halfway through.
4624,FEMBOT,Whee!
4625,CALCULON,"Well, that finishes this paperwork. Calculon Enterprises."
4626,MONIQUE,"Calculon, a fight scene has broken out at the special effects warehouse. Come quickly before a fiery explosion chases someone down a hallway."
4627,CALCULON,I have no choice but to--
4628,ANNOUNCER,"If you want Calculon to race to the laser gun battle in his hover-Ferarri, press 1. If you want Calculon to double-check his paperwork, press 2. Enter now."
4629,CHAIR,You have pressed 2.
4630,FRY,No I didn't!
4631,CHAIR,I'm almost positive you did.
4632,CALCULON,"Add in the carryover from form 16A, then deduct line 2B..."
4633,ROBOT,"Pardon me, sir. But you seem to be inadvertently kicking my seat."
4634,BENDER,"(mocking) ""Pardon me, sir. But you seem to be bleh bleh..."""
4635,ROBOT,"Yes, that's the gist of what I said. Would you mind?"
4636,BENDER,"Sure thing, pal."
4637,ROBOT,"Uh, sir?"
4638,BENDER,(fake shocked) Who threw that?!
4639,ROBOT,"That's it! Sir, I challenge you to fisticuffs!"
4640,BENDER,"Oh, I'm boned."
4641,HATTIE,Let's all go to the lobby!
4642,ROBOT,I'm gonna open a pile whup-ass on you!
4643,LEELA,"Bender, do you know who that was?"
4644,MAN #1,Cripes! The Masked Unit! You knocked him out cold.
4645,MAN #2,I'm impressed.
4646,DOUBLEDEAL,"Son, I'm the commissioner of Ultimate Robot Fighting. I'm a connoisseur of jerks like you who pick fights in movie theatres and you're the biggest I've ever seen."
4647,BENDER,You should see me at funerals.
4648,DOUBLEDEAL,"Kid, I want you in the Ultimate Robot Fighting League."
4649,BENDER,Ultimate Robot Fighting? Sounds pleasant! I'll do it.
4650,FLABBY,My hero!
4651,FARNSWORTH,Aw. They don't make movies like this anymore.
4652,BENDER,"I'm gonna be the greatest Ultimate Robot Fighter ever. Float like a floatbot, sting like an automatic stinging machine!"
4653,AMY,"Bender, you can't be an Ultimate Robot Fighter. It's the most brutal form of competition in the galaxy!"
4654,BENDER,It is?
4655,FARNSWORTH,"There are no rules. Two robots enter, one robot leaves. Then later the other robot leaves after being declared the winner."
4656,BENDER,"Well, that doesn't sound so bad."
4657,FARNSWORTH,"Oh, did I mention the crippling, agonising pain? I'm pretty sure I did. Oh, yes, definitely."
4658,BENDER,Crippling pain? That's not covered by my insurance fraud! Count me out.
4659,LEELA,No! You've got to do it. I don't care how suicidal it is.
4660,FRY,Hey! How come when I wanna do fun stuff that'll kill me you're against it?
4661,LEELA,"This is more important than that marble-eating contest, Fry! It's about pride. Let me tell you a story from my childhood."
4662,ZOIDBERG,"Oh, again with the orphanarium!"
4663,LEELA,"When I was growing up at the orphanarium, I got picked on a lot..."
4664,LEELA,(voice-over) ...My only outlet was Arcturan Kung Fu.
4665,FNOG,"Excellent. Bill, Keith, you will go to Junior Championships. Bill, congratulate Keith when he regains consciousness."
4666,LEELA,"But, Master Fnog, I can beat these dorks with one eye closed."
4667,FNOG,Perhaps. But there is more to winning than beating your opponent. You lack the will of the warrior.
4668,LEELA,What do you mean? Watch this!
4669,BILL,(crying) Ow!
4670,FNOG,"No girl has the will of a warrior. You have the will of a housewife or, at best, the schoolmarm."
4671,LEELA,That's it. I'll take you on right now.
4672,FNOG,"Very well. But, you see, I have the will of the warrior. Therefore, the battle is already over. The winner? Me!  Rematch? You lose again! Had enough? I thought so!"
4673,LEELA,I lost my chance to be a champion. I won't let you throw away yours.
4674,BENDER,Leela's right! I don't wanna end up a loser like her. Count me back in!
4675,LEELA,Let's see what you got. Touch your toes.
4676,BENDER,Still ... can't ... reach!
4677,BENDER,Let's commence preparations for rumbling!
4678,REFEREE,"Ladies and gentlemen and smizmars, welcome to tonight's main event. In this corner, from Mom's Friendly Robot Factory in America's heartland, Mexico: Bender! And in this corner, from and made of Parts Unknown: The Clearcutter!"
4679,FRY,(shouting) Bender rules!
4680,HERMES,(monotonous) I got you an official Bender hat.
4681,FRY,"Wow! Thanks, Hermes!  I-- Hey! Cut that out!"
4682,BENDER,You can't hit what you can't see!
4683,LEELA,"Get up, Bender. You can't quit every time you get an axe in the back.  Or a drill through your face. Now quit scratching your axe-hole and get out there."
4684,BENDER,Huh?
4685,REFEREE,And the winner is ... Bender!
4686,DOUBLEDEAL,"Nice work out there, kid."
4687,BENDER,"Y'know, I think I he might be dead. I took a life!"
4688,CLEARCUTTER,"Hi, boss. Yo, dude!"
4689,BENDER,"Hey, he's not dead. What's up with that?"
4690,DOUBLEDEAL,"What, you didn't read the pamphlet? Ultimate Robot Fighting's a scam, kid. It's rigged.  It's a secret so keep it under your head. But the most popular robot always wins."
4691,BENDER,You mean I'm not a great fighter? I just won 'cause I'm popular?
4692,DOUBLEDEAL,Bingo!
4693,BENDER,Woo-hoo! I'm popular!
4694,DOUBLEDEAL,"In fact, you're more than popular; You're pure lowest common denominator."
4695,BENDER,Go Bender! Go Bender! Go Bender!
4696,REFEREE,Presenting Bender the Offender!
4697,BENDER,I'm just an ex-con trying to go straight and get my kids back.
4698,REFEREE,Versus: Billionairebot!
4699,REFEREE,Versus: The Foreigner!
4700,FOREIGNER,I'm not from here! I have my own customs! Look at my crazy passport!
4701,REFEREE,Versus: The Chain Smoker!
4702,CHAIN SMOKER,I love smoking. And after I win the fight I'm heading straight to your favourite restaurant.
4703,BENDER,"You know, I'm also an Ultimate Robot Lover."
4704,LEELA,Bender! You're three hours late. You can't give up on your training now after both of us worked so hard.
4705,BENDER,"What do you mean, ""we""?"
4706,LEELA,"I said ""us""."
4707,BENDER,"Hey, Bender the Offender doesn't need you. Bender the Offender doesn't need anybody!"
4708,FEMBOT #1,"What about us, Mr. The Offender?"
4709,BENDER,Well obviously I need floozies! Let's roll!
4710,BENDER,"Howdy, chief. For my next bout, what do you say I fight these two bimbos in some mud?"
4711,DOUBLEDEAL,"Actually, we've decided to go in a different direction."
4712,BENDER,What if I told your we wouldn't be fighting in the conventional sense?
4713,DOUBLEDEAL,"Bender, your popularity is slipping."
4714,FOREIGNER,Sales of your Bender Brand French milk bath soaps are down 20%.
4715,BENDER,"Those morons! I said pea berry, not sandalwood!"
4716,DOUBLEDEAL,"Damnit, Bender! If you can't move sandalwood, you don't belong in this league! That's why you're gonna lose next week's title match."
4717,BENDER,But the crowd loves me.
4718,DOUBLEDEAL,Perhaps. But let's see how they feel about your new persona: The Gender Bender.
4719,BILLIONAIREBOT,You'll be the most unpopular robot fighter since Sergeant Faeces Processor.
4720,BENDER,"Oh, yeah?  Well what if I don't let the new guy win?"
4721,DOUBLEDEAL,"Then he'll just have to beat you the old-fashioned way: To death!  Melissa, send in the new kid."
4722,DESTRUCTOR,I am Destructor!
4723,BENDER,(squeaky) See you at the fight.
4724,BENDER,"So then I said, ""See you at the fight"". And that's the story."
4725,FRY,"Man, I thought Ultimate Robot Fighting was real, like pro wrestling. But it turns out it's fixed, like boxing."
4726,BENDER,"It's one thing to win a fixed fight -- there's dignity in that. But to lose? And in this atrocity? I can't do it! Leela, you gotta train me to win."
4727,LEELA,"No way! If you wouldn't take my help when you didn't need it, why should I give it to you now when you do need it?"
4728,FARNSWORTH,What the hell are you talking about?
4729,LEELA,I don't know. But I'm not helping.
4730,ANNOUNCER,You loved him as Bender the Offender! Now get ready to hate him as he threatens your sexuality in his new persona ... The Gender Bender!
4731,BENDER,I'm a real toughie!
4732,ANNOUNCER,Squaring off this Sunday versus Destructor!
4733,DESTRUCTOR,I will destroy you!  And stop calling me!
4734,FNOG,"I am Destructor's trainer, Master Fnog. My pupil will be victorious for he has the will of a warrior!"
4735,LEELA,"Not Fnog! Bender, let's hit the gym. I'm gonna teach you to fight like a girl!"
4736,BENDER,(determined) I'll put on my tutu!
4737,"""COSELL""","Hello and welcome to a remarkable championship bout. Destructor, a robotic armoured tank whose very use at battle has been ruled a war crime versus, Gender Bender, who wears a pink tutu.  This is Rich Little imitating Howard Cosell, here at ringside with George Foreman. George, a word in edgewise?"
4738,FOREMAN,This could be the most one-sided fight since 1973 when Ali faced an 80-foot tall mechanical Joe Frazier. M-My memory's not what it used to be but I think the entire Earth was destroyed.
4739,LITTLE,"Interesting, if true. The Vegas odds tonight stand at an unprecedented 1000-0: A bet of $0 on Bender pays $1000 if he wins. Still, very few takers."
4740,FOREMAN,It's not-not a smart bet.
4741,LEELA,"According to the script, you're supposed to prance out and tickle him with your fairy wand. Instead, I want you to prance out and kick his head off!"
4742,BENDER,"Got it. Large kickle, hold the tickle!"
4743,HERMES,Thank God I'm free of that nightmare!
4744,BENDER,"Sorry, buddy. Here you go!"
4745,HERMES,(monotonous) Thank you. It was cold down there on the floor.
4746,AMY,"Here, Professor, I got you a programme."
4747,FARNSWORTH,"Oh, good. Just let me put on my reading glasses.  Why, Zoidberg, there's a lovely photo of you in here."
4748,REFEREE,"In this corner, the confused young robot with the golden curls weighing 525lbs: The Gender Bender!"
4749,ZAPP,Boo!
4750,NIXON,Get that hippie out of the ring!
4751,REFEREE,"And in these two corners, weighing 400 tons, the gizmo from Pismo ... Beach, Destructor!"
4752,FNOG,"So, we meet again. Most amusing: Girl who acts like fighter training fighter who acts like girl."
4753,LEELA,"Keep laughing, Fnog!  Ready, Bender?"
4754,BENDER,"I was born ready! Gimmie the bell! Did you hear a noise?  Final boarding call for flight 406, non-stop service to pain.  Now boarding standby passengers--"
4755,FOREMAN,"This seems like as good a time as any time to bring up my new grill for no reason.  With its patented design, the fat drains directly into my mouth."
4756,BENDER,"(weakly) Fry! Throw in the towel!  For God's sakes, Fry!"
4757,HERMES,(monotonous) That's exactly what I was thinking.
4758,BENDER,(weakly) Mommy!
4759,LEELA,"OK, Fnog, that's enough. Call him off. Fnog?  Hmm."
4760,BENDER,Why won't anyone help me?
4761,LEELA,"So, once more we meet again."
4762,FNOG,Huh?
4763,LEELA,"You didn't train Destructor. You're just controlling him like a puppet. I mean, cheating in a fake fight. That's low!"
4764,FNOG,Better than being a girl. Like you. You're a girl!
4765,LEELA,"(ironic) Oh, right. Girls lack the will of the warrior!"
4766,BENDER,Huh? It's bendering time!  Take this. And this!
4767,FNOG,You were an excellent student.  Too bad I was a lousy teacher!
4768,BENDER,"I think you misunderstood the concept of ""bendering time""!"
4769,FNOG,See you in girl hell. I'll be in boy hell -- much nicer!
4770,LEELA,Yes!
4771,BENDER,Yes!  Oh!
4772,REFEREE,And the winner is Destructor!
4773,LITTLE,I've not seen a spectacle of this nature in all my years impersonating a sportscaster.
4774,FOREMAN,"It sure was some fight. Interesting side note: As a head without a body, I envy the dead."
4775,LITTLE,No argument here.
4776,FRY,Bender? How did the fight go? I heard somebody got flattened!
4777,AMY,"Fry, where's your Brain Slug?"
4778,FARNSWORTH,Poor little guy starved to death.
4779,LEELA,"I'm proud of you, Bender. Sure, you lost. You lost bad. But the important thing is I beat up someone who hurt my feelings in high school."
4780,BENDER,I'm in tremendous pain here.
4781,DOUBLEDEAL,"Great job, kid. You lost and you made it look almost half real. I want you to have this card good for 10% off at Bed Bath & Beyond."
4782,BENDER,Yes! I'm the greatest! The greatest!
4783,LITTLE,And so ends the chronicle of one of the greatest ever to play the sport.
4784,FOREMAN,And he didn't look half bad in the tutu.
4785,LITTLE,That he did surely not.
4786,FOREMAN,What?
4787,THE END,
4788,"""A BICYCLOPS BUILT FOR TWO""",
4789,FARNSWORTH,"Good news everyone! Several years ago I tried to log on to AOL, and it just went through! Wheee! We're online!"
4790,FARNSWORTH,Go ahead! Get into these net suits. I designed and tested them myself.
4791,LEELA,It smells like burning recess monkey.
4792,FARNSWORTH,Really? I guess when you're around it all day you stop noticing. Off you go.
4793,FRY,Hey!
4794,BENDER,Behold! The internet!
4795,FRY,My God! It's full of ads!
4796,LEELA,Follow me!
4797,FRY,It's immense.
4798,LEELA,It's got every piece of information anyone could ever want.
4799,FRY,So I see!
4800,ZOIDBERG,What? What's going on here?
4801,AMY,"Hey, that's me!"
4802,BENDER,No it isn't. I just took some pictures of your face and stuck them on someone else's body.
4803,LEELA,Hey!
4804,MAN,Are you over 18?
4805,KID,Yes.
4806,YOUNGER KID,Yes.
4807,BENDER,I'm telling you Fry they've got a chatroom for everybody. And here it is.
4808,AMY,"Ew, that is so gross!"
4809,LEELA,Yeah. I'll stick with this one thank you.
4810,AMY,Yeah.
4811,BENDER (SEXFULLY),"Hi, I'm a naughty nurse and I really need someone to talk to. 9.95 a minute."
4812,MAN #2,"Ooo, you're a dollar naughtier than most."
4813,BENDER,So how 'bout them Knicks?
4814,NERD #1,Hello? Are there any girls in this room at all?
4815,NERD #2,"Yeah, bring on the hot chicks 'cause I'm a hot stud."
4816,NERDS,Yeah!
4817,NERD #3,So are we!
4818,LEELA,"I'm a woman if that's what you mean. I don't like to play games so I'll just say I'm a cyclops, I'm a spaceship captain, I'm the only one of my species and I'm interested in meeting a man."
4819,NERD #4,A woman. I'm scared.
4820,FRY,"Well, thanks to the internet, I'm bored with sex. Is there a place on the web that panders to my lust for violence?"
4821,BENDER (SARCASTIC),Is the space pope reptilian?
4822,HERMES,Get ready for fun Fry. Nowadays we have a type of game played entirely on video.
4823,LEELA,"We call it a ""video game."""
4824,FRY (SARCASTIC),"Uh, ""video game"" you say? Well golly gee, you mighty spacemen of the future will have to show me how it works."
4825,ZOIDBERG,The doctor is in!  The doctor is out.
4826,FARNSWORTH,"Everyone please sign off, we have a delivery. Plus I have to use the phone -  Leela please tell the others that -"
4827,LEELA,Who are you?
4828,CYCLOPS,I saw you in the chatroom but you left before I had a chance to talk to you. After all these years of searching for another Cyclops.
4829,LEELA,I can't believe it. I've dreamed of this moment all my life.
4830,CYCLOPS,Do you think perhaps you and I - ?
4831,LEELA,"Fry, you idiot. Ever since I was abandoned on Earth I've been searching for who my people are and where they come from. Then I finally meet another Cyclops and you blast him. You wrecked my one chance to learn who I am."
4832,FRY,Oh Leela. I feel terrible. If there's anything I can ever do -  Gotcha!  I won! I'm the greatest!
4833,LEELA,Come on. We have worked to do.
4834,FRY,Are you still mad at me for wrecking your once in a lifetime chance to learn the meaning of your existence?
4835,LEELA,"No, I'm just happy you were able to win a video game. Now lets concentrate on getting this desperately needed popcorn to the people of Cineplex 14 OK?"
4836,VOICE,"Leela, you've got mail.  It's not spam!"
4837,LEELA,Huh?  It's him!
4838,CYCLOPS [ON SCREEN],To: Leela. Subject: Hello. I am Alkazar. Fortunately I wrote down your screenname before I was dispatched by that oaffish moron.
4839,FRY,Kicked your ass!
4840,ALKAZAR [ON SCREEN],Leela we have much to discuss. Please come join me on the planet of your birth. Co-ordinates follow.
4841,FRY,Too bad we gotta make that urgent popcorn delivery.
4842,LEELA,It'll get there.
4843,LEELA,After a whole life of searching I may finally have found where I belong.
4844,BENDER,Too bad it's a dump.
4845,LEELA,Look at that statue. It's only got one eye.
4846,FRY,Lazy sculptor!
4847,ALKAZAR,Welcome home Leela.
4848,LEELA,Alkazar?  Are you real? Or am I seeing single?
4849,ALKAZAR,Ow! Of course I'm real!
4850,LEELA,"After all this time. Somebody else with one eye who isn't a clumsy carpenter or, uh, a kid with a BB gun."
4851,ALKAZAR,It's alright Leela. You'll never be alone again.  Let me introduce you to yourself.  Do you mind if your servants walk?
4852,LEELA,Not at all!
4853,ALKAZAR,"We are the last remaining Cyclopses. Our planet is Cyclopia. This is our capital, Cyclops City. Stop me if I'm going too fast for you."
4854,LEELA,There's so much information and yet somehow I feel as if I know it all already.
4855,ALKAZAR,This sacred mosaic depicts our goddess of beauty.
4856,FRY,"Hmm, you got any sacred artwork of her from the back?"
4857,ALKAZAR,"Her perfect eye reminds me of yours Leela. Had our race survived, you would have been a temple priestess or a supermodel."
4858,LEELA,Oh please! Really?
4859,ALKAZAR,"And there's the pirate Purple Beard, scourge of the six seas."
4860,FRY,What's over that hill?
4861,ALKAZAR,The Forbidden Valley. A holy sancturary where no one may tread.
4862,FRY,Is that anything like a cemetary 'cause I gotta take a leak.  Ow!
4863,LEELA,"Fry, that's offensive to our people. Isn't it?"
4864,FRY,Ow!
4865,ALKAZAR,This is my home. I hope you don't think less of me because I live in a giant castle.
4866,LEELA,"Oh no not at all. If anything, I'm more impressed."
4867,BENDER,Ooo! I'm gonna need to make some room!
4868,ALKAZAR,In here's where I dream my lonely dreams and cook my simple meals.
4869,LEELA,It's all so sad. What happened to our people?
4870,ALKAZAR,"Its too painful to speak of now. Come, I'll show you your quarters."
4871,BENDER,Ow!  Ow!  Ow!
4872,LEELA,I heard you from my room. What's wrong?
4873,ALKAZAR,It's just - no Leela. I don't want to see tears in your perfect eye.
4874,LEELA,"Please, is it bout the fate of our people? Because I'm very interested in that."
4875,ALKAZAR,Well OK. But it's chilly and you're going to be all wet from the tears. Let's go into my chamber.
4876,ALKAZAR (VOICE OVER),It wasn't long ago. Our people were happy and prosperous...
4877,ALKAZAR (VOICE OVER),...but the eyeless mole people of Subterra 3 grew jealous of our visual proness. They fired missile in all directions hoping to hit Cyclopia.
4878,ALKAZAR (VOICE OVER),"Unfortunately, one of the 40 planets hit, was ours."
4879,CYCLOPIAN,How far away do you think it is?
4880,SCIENTIST,A trillion miles?
4881,ALKAZAR,"Things got hot. You look a little hot, you can take off that jacket.  Our people don't like to be hot. Anyway, just before the impact..."
4882,ALKAZAR (VOICE OVER),Our smartest scientists managed to save one baby
4883,LEELA,"Alkazar, I used to be a baby, it might have been me!"
4884,ALKAZAR (VOICE OVER),"Fortunately I was employed as a pool cleaner at the time and when I emerged from retrieving a dead possum, I found I was the only one left."
4885,LEELA,It's so tragic.
4886,ALKAZAR,"Yes, but the real tragedy is that our race ends with us."
4887,LEELA,It doesn't have to.
4888,ALKAZAR,What do you mean?
4889,LEELA,You're a male and I'm a female.
4890,ALKAZAR,I'm still not following you.
4891,LEELA,Wake up my king.
4892,ALKAZAR,Oh jeez what a night. Make me some coffee would you.
4893,LEELA,"Uh, sure OK. What do you take with that?"
4894,ALKAZAR,"Pancakes and sausage. Kitchen's in the basement, pans are in the attic."
4895,LEELA,Maybe after breakfast we can talk about rebuilding our civilisation.
4896,FRY,Mmm! Great pancakes Leela!
4897,ALKAZAR,"Yeah they'll come in handy if I need to cover any tiny manholes.  Listen hun, we don't want to look like slobs in front of the other species do we?"
4898,LEELA,No.
4899,ALKAZAR,So get to work on these dishes. And then organise my collection of naked celebrity photos by name and what you can see.
4900,LEELA,Look Alkazar.
4901,ALKAZAR,Call me Al.
4902,LEELA,Look Al. I know you've been living alone a long time and I can sympathise but I'm not your maid.
4903,ALKAZAR,"You're right, I'm sorry. It looks like the relationshipisn't going to work afterall. So much for the Cyclops race. I thought it was a pretty good race but -"
4904,LEELA,"OK OK, I'll do the dishes.  Hey where'd they go?"
4905,BENDER,"Ah, Leela's experiencing the greatest joy a woman can feel: Worshipping some lowlife jerk."
4906,FRY,He may be some lowlife jerk but I don't trust him. I think he's hiding something and I'm gonna find out what it is.
4907,FRY,Try and stop me!
4908,LEELA,Al? I did my hair the way you wanted it.  Who are these people?
4909,ALKAZAR,Friends.
4910,LEELA,"Hey, where'd you get this couch and that TV set and all this stuff?"
4911,ALKAZAR,They were giving it away on the street corner. Just like you Leela.
4912,LEELA,"Too bad they weren't giving away the three things you actually need: Mouthwash, a back wax and stain-proof underwear."
4913,RAT WOMAN,You go girl!
4914,ALKAZAR,By the way your pal Fry fell into the dungeon. Feed him a taco so he doesn't die and stink up the place.
4915,LEELA,"Come on Al, can't you let the little guy out?"
4916,ALKAZAR,"Jeez Leela, twice in one day? I'm not Superman!"
4917,LEELA,Why were you sneaking into my people's forbidden valley?
4918,FRY,"'Cause I think Alkazar's hding something. Listen Leela, you may not like it, you may not believe it, you may not wanna hear it but Alkazar's a jerk, he's bad for you. He -"
4919,LEELA,I know.
4920,FRY,You do?
4921,LEELA,Fry if it's obvious to you with your learning disability then of course it's obvious to me! He's crude and gross and he treats me like a slave.
4922,FRY,Then dump his one eyed ass.
4923,LEELA,I can't. If I leave Alkazar then that's the end of the Cyclops race. And I won't let that happen. Even if that means a lifetime of unhappiness.
4924,LEELA,I'll break up with him at dinner.
4925,FRY,I'll be there.
4926,ALKAZAR,"Yo Leela, what gives? Pig says your slop tastes like crap."
4927,PIG,"Yeah, like crap."
4928,FRY,C'mon Leela you deserve better than this guy! Dump him already!
4929,LEELA,I'm trying.
4930,ALKAZAR,"Hey everyone jam a sock in your spit faucets.  Not long ago I spent my lonely nights renting slash flicks with Rat Man and his girlfriend. But then a beautiful woman arrived and - stop eating pig! And she brought new hope for me and our once great civilisation. Now a million centuries of Cyclops destiny depend on the answer to one question......Leela, will you marry me?"
4931,FRY (WHISPERING),No! No!
4932,LEELA,Yes! I Will!
4933,FRY,Ohh!
4934,RAT WOMAN,They're getting married!
4935,AMY,Congratulations Leela!
4936,ZOIDBERG,Hello!
4937,HERMES,Oh this is great!
4938,FRY,"Pst, Leela. you've got to get me out of here. It's horrible, eating scraps, letting my waste drop wherever it falls like an animal in the zoo."
4939,LEELA,Animals go in the corner.
4940,FRY,The corner! Why didn't I think of that?
4941,LEELA,"Look Fry I'd like to help you but it's my wedding and I'm kind of busy.  Here, try to be happy for me. That way at least one of us will be."
4942,FRY,That's it! It's time for this bird to walk.
4943,FRY,Bender come on. We've got to get some dirt on Alkazar. Lets go and find out what makes the Forbidden Valley so forbidden.
4944,BENDER,Uh no thanks I'm good.
4945,FRY,But there's probably some cool forbidden stuff you can steal.
4946,BENDER,I don't know Fry. For the first time in my life I feel like I've stolen enough.
4947,FRY,"Bender, snap out of it!"
4948,BENDER,"Sorry I don't know what came over me. Let's go.  (singing) I love stealing, I love taking things!"
4949,ZOIDBERG (CRYING),That pig over there is wearing the same sandals as me.
4950,FRY,"Come on boy, jump!  Good boy!"
4951,BENDER,Whoa Mittens!
4952,FRY,My God! Four identical castles!
4953,BENDER,Each more identical than the last!
4954,FRY,"That's weird. It's another Cyclops, only this one has five eyes."
4955,BENDER,And here's another one with no eyes.
4956,PREACHERBOT,Does anyone have a reason why this couple shall not be joined in the irrevocable shackles of holy bliss?
4957,FARNSWORTH,Saving a race of one-eyed monsters? Who could object to that?
4958,ALKAZAR,Cut to the chase Preach!
4959,PREACHERBOT,Do you Alkazar......takethiswomanbeforeyou...tolove..insickness..do you part?
4960,ALKAZAR,Yeah sure I do come on faster!
4961,PREACHERBOT,"Do you Leela, copy and paste his response til death do you part?"
4962,LEELA,I..d -
4963,AMY,Oh my God!
4964,ALKAZAR,What the?
4965,FRY,"Hey Alkazar, you left somebody off the guest list."
4966,5-EYES,"Alkazar, why you are so late for our wedding? And why you have only one eye?"
4967,ALKAZAR,"It, uh, oo!  Uh, hey sweetie, just go back to the castle and wait for me. She, she's nuts, I can morph into a 5-eyed alien and I kinda said I'd marry her. But I'm really a Cyclops and I'm really going to marry you."
4968,FRY,Oh yeah? Then what about this?
4969,ALKAZAR,This is a bit awkward.
4970,5-EYES,Who's she?
4971,LEELA,Who's she?
4972,SANDY,Who are they?
4973,ALKAZAR,Go back to the castle Sandy.
4974,FRY,And maybe you'd like to meet her.  And her.
4975,ALKAZAR,"Leela, this must all be ver confusing."
4976,LEELA,A little. That's why I've decided to hurt you until you explain it.
4977,SANDY,Show us your real form!
4978,LEELA,Yeah!
4979,THING #2,Do it!
4980,ALKAZAR,"Well, this is the real me. But I can explain. We all have needs. Mine was to make it with five weirdos and have them scrub my five castles. I gave you all what you wanted and of course I made a few bucks letting Pig watch through the two way mirror. Can any of you sa you wouldn't have done the exact same thing in my position?"
4981,BENDER (CRYING),He's a saint!
4982,LEELA,But why did you have all five weddings on the same day?
4983,ALKAZAR,"Hey lady, you got any idea how much it costs to rent a tux that changes shape?"
4984,LEELA,"Alright Alkazar, I just have one last question for you."
4985,ALKAZAR,What's that?
4986,LEELA,"If you can change form, why didn't you change it in the one place that counts?"
4987,LEELA,Thanks for saving me from that creep Fry.
4988,FRY,"Hey, that's what I do."
4989,LEELA,"I guess I was so desperate to find out who I really was, I forgot who I really was."
4990,FARNSWORTH,"No harm done. In the many decades you'll work to repay me for that shipment of popcorn you destroyed, you'll have plenty of time to search for your true home."
4991,LEELA,"Yeah. I mean, how many planets can there be?"
4992,THE END,
4993,"""HOW HERMES REQUISITIONED HIS GROOVE BACK""",
4994,HERMES,"Finally, the last form of the day. Welcome to stampy-town. Population - five! And now for the finishing touch.  Ah, the cycle of bureaucracy.  Sweet gorilla of Manila! A letter from the Central Bureaucracy!  (reading) Attention Hermes Conrad, you are about to recieve a letter from the Central Bureaucracy.  My God! It's from the Central Bureaucracy!"
4995,LEELA,I'm having a poker game tonight with some friends from my old cryogenics job. You guys interested?
4996,BENDER,I don't know. I only gamble with chumps.
4997,FRY,I'll play.
4998,BENDER,I'm in.
4999,ZOIDBERG,"Leela, Fry, robot. No matter what it is you're doing tonight, I'm available."
5000,LEELA,"We're playing poker. but I'm warning you, my friends are serious players."
5001,ZOIDBERG,"Bah, big shots. I say let the dice do the talking."
5002,FRY,"Wow, you look happy. Is someone fired?"
5003,HERMES,"Better. The Central Bureaucracy is conducting an inspection tomorrow. I'll finally be promoted to grade 35, the 35th highest grade there is."
5004,LEELA,"Hermes, wait! We're having a poker party. Stay and whip off a batch of your famous jerk dip."
5005,HERMES,Sorry. I spent all day putting my office in order. Now I got to go home and relax the traditional Jamaican way - a glass of warm milk and good night sleep.
5006,FRY,Jamaican? I thought you were some kinda outer space potato man.
5007,LEELA,Ah that must be my old boss.
5008,IPGEE,"Hello Leela, you're fired."
5009,LEELA,I know.
5010,IPGEE,I'm sorry but it's just that you're over a year late for work at this point.
5011,TERRY (DRAMATICALLY),Let the games begin!
5012,IPGEE,"So I told Leela, ""Your request for a date is most flattering but I must decline."" These office romances never work out. Afterall, that is how I met my horrible wife."
5013,LEELA,But you never wore your ring. I didn't know you had a wife.
5014,IPGEE,And my wife doesn't know I have a job. I keep my personal and professional lives serparate.
5015,BENDER,"C'mon, let's deal. You'll have plenty of time to talk when you're poor."
5016,FRY,What's with the specs Bender?
5017,BENDER,They're my lucky shades. I stole them off some lucky guy while his lucky seeing eye dog was taking a whiz.
5018,FRY,Hey!
5019,ZOIDBERG,I can't spell anything with these cards.
5020,ZOIDBERG,"Finally, I have a good claw. See?  Three human females, a number and a king giving himself brain surgery."
5021,FRY,"It doesn't matter how many human females you have, Bender's on a hot streak."
5022,BENDER,"Uh, what can I say? Must be my lucky shades!  Nothing, nothing, crap, crap, garbage.  Read 'em and leak saltwater!"
5023,FRY,Oh man!
5024,TERRY,My baby's milk money!
5025,IPGEE,Oh I am broke. What will I tell my horrible wife?
5026,BENDER,If I were you I'd be more worried about that tapeworm going to town on your intestines.
5027,IPGEE,Let me see those glasses.
5028,BENDER,Um...uh...
5029,IPGEE,Oh my various gods! X-Ray specs!
5030,BENDER,"Guys, I swear those are prescription. I need them for reading stuff - on the other side of stuff."
5031,LOU,Cheater!
5032,IPGEE,Get him!
5033,TERRY,Break his neck!
5034,ZOIDBERG,No don't hurt him! He's my best friend!
5035,HERMES,Great cow of Moscow!
5036,BENDER,"Uh, it was ghosts! Big ones! And a tornado!"
5037,HERMES,Oh! I'll never pass inspection now! They'll bust me lower than a limbo stick - at carnival time.  (crying) And that's as low as limbo sticks get.
5038,FRY,Aw hey c'mon don't worry. We'll watch you clean up.
5039,HERMES,It's too late. The inspector will be here in exactly one second.
5040,HERMES,Who the hell are you?
5041,MORGAN,"Morgan Proctor, bureaucrat grade 19."
5042,HERMES,"Hermes Conrad, bureaucrat grade 36."
5043,MORGAN,Enough friendly banter. Shall we begin the inspection?
5044,HERMES,This way please.
5045,FRY (WHISPERING),"Jeez Hermes, you seem awfully calm about this."
5046,HERMES (WHISPERING),Don't worry. I have a plan.
5047,HERMES (SHOUTING),I'm going to jump!
5048,AMY (SHOUTING),No!
5049,ZOIDBERG (SHOUTING),No!
5050,BENDER (SHOUTING),Do a flip!
5051,LEELA (SHOUTING),Don't do it Hermes! You have so much to live for!
5052,LABARBARA (SHOUTING),Husband! Nooo!
5053,HERMES,Outta my way wife...!
5054,HERMES,...I wasn't cut out to be a bureaucrat anyway. I'm only anal 78.36% of the time. I'm not worthy to stamp a form. So I'll stamp the pavement with my flabby body.
5055,MORGAN (SHOUTING),Bureaucrat Conrad...!
5056,MORGAN (SHOUTING),"...If you complete your death transaction with out filing a suicide and/or falling accident permit, you will be posthumously demoted."
5057,HERMES,Life. Death. Either way I'm demoted to a tiny cubicle.
5058,HERMES,Sweet something of...of someplace.
5059,MORGAN,As your superior I hereby relieve you of duty. Consider yourself on paid vacation.
5060,HERMES,Oh! The ultimate penalty.
5061,ZOIDBERG,"I recommend the health cure on Spa 5, the sauna planet. Here, read."
5062,LABARBARA,Spa 5? Is it good?
5063,ZOIDBERG,"Oh, it's wonderful! I don't know anything about it but they send me a bucket of krill for every patient I send."
5064,MORGAN,"Naturally I'll have to assign a bureaucrat to fill in for Hermes while he's away. I assign me, I accept, welcome aboard."
5065,ZOIDBERG,Then it's settled. Hermes will relax and Zoidberg will eat! Hurrah!
5066,MORGAN,"I've been reviewing your corporate records. Regarding last Monday's delivery, why did it take twice as long as scheduled?"
5067,LEELA,Fry got his head stuck in a crater.
5068,FRY (ASHAMED),I thought it would fit.
5069,MORGAN,"And during this period of head-crater interaction, what were you doing?"
5070,BENDER,Martini drinking contests with the autopilot. I would've had him this time but we ran out of olives.
5071,LEELA,I can explain.
5072,MORGAN,You really think you can explain how you left port without a full compliment of olives? I think not.
5073,LEELA (QUIETLY),"What is this, high school?"
5074,MORGAN,Locker check!
5075,MORGAN,Why isn't this jacket in alphabetical order?
5076,LEELA,What?
5077,MORGAN,The zipper. It should be at the bottom.
5078,BENDER (ASHAMED),"Hey, sometimes a guy gets lonely."
5079,MORGAN,I - I've never seen anything like this. Why is there yoghurt in this cap?
5080,FRY,"Uh, I can explain that. See, it used to be milk and, well, time makes fools of us all."
5081,MORGAN,"You are all dismissed. Fry, I will speak to you alone."
5082,FRY,"Uh wait, this is the other Fry's locker. I'm Phry with a ""Ph."""
5083,FRY,What the hell's going on? I thought you were anti-dirty not pro-dirty.
5084,MORGAN,I'm surrounded by neat freaks everyday. There's nothing kinkier to me than a filthy slop-jock like you!
5085,FRY (BASHFUL),Oh stop!
5086,MORGAN,Now listen you filthy pig. No-one can know about us. If anyone asks I'll deny it.
5087,FRY,Just like very other girl I've dated.
5088,HERMES,"Curse that Dr Zoidberg! If I get out of here, he'll be looking down the business end of a shrimp fork!"
5089,AUSTRALIAN GUY,Give him one for me too mate. I don't know why I go to him.
5090,MORGAN,"...and for those six and a half reasons, I am demoting Leela to co-pilot."
5091,LEELA,Co-pilot? Under who?
5092,MORGAN,The autopilot.
5093,LEELA,That drunk?!
5094,MORGAN,Mr Bender you are now in charge of co-ordinating the Professor's bodily functions.
5095,FARNSWORTH,That's a full time job.
5096,MORGAN,"And Fry, as for you, I am promoting you to executive delivery boy. You will no longer go on deliveries and you will have your own office next to mine."
5097,FRY,All right!
5098,MORGAN,Mr Bender would you high five him so we can continue this meeting?  And on the rebound?  Meeting adjourned.
5099,AMY,I can't figure why she's so nice to you Fry.
5100,ZOIDBERG,She's a hateful monster this Morgan. She scolded and hit me. I tell you she's risking my friendship with her.
5101,LEELA,"Bender, what happened to you?"
5102,BENDER,"Morgan made me walk the Professor. There we were in the park when suddenly some old lady says I stole her purse. I chucked the Professor at her but she kept on coming. So had to hit her with this purse I found. Ah, the point is it's Morgan's fault. That pencil pushing scazwag.  Why if she were here I'd - Uh oh is she behind me?"
5103,MORGAN,No. I'm in front of you!
5104,FRY,Morgan? It's 3am.
5105,MORGAN,"I know. A skunk knocked over my garbage and suddenly all I could think of was you.  My God, it's so...repulsive. So uh, this is where you eat?"
5106,FRY,Eat and sleep.
5107,MORGAN,Oh Fry!
5108,FRY,"Uh wait, Bender's my rooommate. He could be back any second."
5109,MORGAN,Not likely. I ordered him to flush out the Professor's earwax.
5110,BENDER,"Hey Fry, I made you a candle with - What the?  Oh now I see! Now I get it. Now the pieces are falling into place. The office, the promotion, that dwarf in my book club who steals my opinions.  It's all coming together now!"
5111,BENDER,I must say this opens my eyes! Another case closed my dear Watson.
5112,FRY,"Morgan, come back! He's stuck in a loop!"
5113,BENDER,For I was blind but now I see!
5114,BENDER [FROM INSIDE],The cat's out of the bag now!
5115,MORGAN,Mr Bender about last night. that was just a...a misunderstanding.
5116,BENDER,Oh you didn't understand? Well let me explain. You......were having sex with you.
5117,MORGAN,"No. You see, a bureaucrat of my rank isn't supposed to fraternize."
5118,BENDER,"That's what makes it so juicy. Its the forbidden fruit angle everybody loves. First I'll say ""You'll never guess who saw Fry and Morgan doing it!"" and they'll say ""Who Bender, who?"" and I'll say ""It was lovable......old Bender."""
5119,FRY,"Hey, what did you do to him?"
5120,MORGAN,"I downloaded his brain. Everything that is Bender is right here. His mind, his memories, his in-your-face interface."
5121,FRY,"But, but...Bender need brain...for...smart making!  What did you do now? Stop doing things!"
5122,MORGAN,I sent the disk to be filed at the Central Bureaucracy. I did what I had to do Fry. He was a bad robot.
5123,FRY,"No, he was a bad friend. I want him back right now."
5124,MORGAN,Then you should have filed a request 20 years ago.
5125,FRY,I'm sick of you and your bureaucracy.
5126,MORGAN,Dirty boy! Dirty boy!
5127,LEELA,You and Morgan were having an affair?
5128,FRY,I couldn't help it. She loved me because of the part of me that's a slob and I loved her because of the part of me that's desperate.
5129,FRY,Poor Bender. Without his brain he's become all quiet and helpful. We've got to go to the Central Bureaucracy and get that disk back!
5130,AMY,Yeah!
5131,FARNSWORTH,"Oh yes we must, yes."
5132,AMY,Why?
5133,LEELA,"Well, those arguments aside, we're still going."
5134,FARNSWORTH,You can't just waltz into the Central Bureaucracy. It's a tangled web of red tape and regulations. I've never been but a friend of mine went completely mad trying to find the washroom there.
5135,LEELA,Then we'll need a guide. Someone who's been there before.
5136,FARNSWORTH,Oh I've been there. Lot's of times!
5137,HERMES,Look at that. The carts go out full but they come in empty. It's criminally inefficient.
5138,HERMES,But don't you see? They could increase efficiency 4% if they used the empty carts to haul in heavy mining machinery.
5139,AUSTRALIAN GUY,Oh Lord!
5140,FRY,"Man, how long is this gonna take?"
5141,OLD MAN,I'm still waiting on my birth certificate.
5142,FARNSWORTH,Well it doesn't look like I'll make it inside with the rest of you. Uh but good luck. Just leave me where I drop.
5143,OLD MAN,"Oh great, someone had a baby!"
5144,LEELA,"Come on, I have a better idea."
5145,LEELA,Excuse me? We're from the Planet Express delivery company. We're here to deliver a robot.
5146,GRADE 53,Looks like we've got a new office cut up!
5147,GRADE 41,"Look out, look out! I'm going to crash my slow-mobile! I had to swerve to avoid you."
5148,LEELA,"While you're crashing, could you tell us where all these canisters end up?"
5149,GRADE 41,Oh you want Central Filing.
5150,LEELA,
5151,FRY,
5152,AMY,OK thanks.
5153,FARNSWORTH,Wonderful.
5154,GRADE 41 (SCREAMING),Nooo!
5155,GRADE 20,Central Filing? Of course I know where that is. I'm a grade 20.
5156,LEELA,Where is it?
5157,GRADE 20,I can't tell you. What do I look like? A grade 16?
5158,LEELA,"We're getting nowhere slowly. Here, I'll address this to the Central Filing room.  Then we'll track it using my wrist-lojack-amater."
5159,WRIST THING,Cold. Cold. Warmer. Hot hot hot hot hot hot.
5160,GRADE 11,Please don't tell my supervisor I was sleeping.
5161,LEELA,"This is it. We'll just run in, grab Bender's disk and run out. Got it?"
5162,FRY,We'll never find that disk will we Bender?
5163,FRY,You're right. Nothing is over so long as there's one thin ray of hope.
5164,MORGAN,Lost something?  I should have known you'd come here rather than follow proper procedure. And I did know. And that's why I came here.
5165,FRY,"Listen Morgan, We're through, you're an evil heartless woman and I never wanna see you again. However would you help us get Bender back for old times sake?"
5166,MORGAN,I'm afraid he's lost in the master in pile. And it would take some sort of giant mechanical atomic powered sorting machine to find him.
5167,HERMES,You rang?
5168,FARNSWORTH,"Dammit Hermes, just jump already. Stop hogging that healthy liver."
5169,HERMES,"No, I want to live. Organising that forced labour spa rekindled my lifelong love of bureaucracy."
5170,LABARBARA,My Hermes got that hellhole running so efficiently that all the physical labour is now done by a single Australian man.
5171,LEELA,But how did you know we were here?
5172,HERMES,Dr Zoidberg brought us.
5173,ZOIDBERG,"It was me, I'm the hero!"
5174,NUMBER 1.0,Request for explanantion of incident meeting?
5175,MORGAN,Number 1.0.
5176,HERMES,"Number 1.0, I hereby petition you for an emergency sort-and-file, under regulation 2 point -"
5177,NUMBER 1.0,Don't quote me regulations. I co-chaired the committee that reviewed the recommendation to revise the colour of the book that regulation's in. We kept it grey.
5178,HERMES,"Sir please, I must located the disk with my friend's brain on it."
5179,NUMBER 1.0,Very well. But your bureaucratic licence will be revoked if you fail to sort the master in pile by closing time. 1pm.
5180,LEELA,That's only four minutes from now.
5181,HERMES,Requisition me a beat.
5182,LABARBARA (SINGING),But something changed when my man turn pro.
5183,HERMES (SINGING),I was sortin' but I wasn't smilin'.
5184,LABARBARA (SINGING),He forgot that it's not about badges and ranks.
5185,HERMES (SINGING),It's supposed to be about the filing! People!
5186,ZOIDBERG (SINGING),They said I probably shouldn't be a surgeon.
5187,FARNSWORTH (SINGING),They poo-pooed my electric frankfurter.
5188,LEELA (SINGING),They said I probably shouldn't fly with just one eye.
5189,HERMES (SINGING),Everybody sing Jamaica!
5190,EVERYBODY (SINGING),Jamaica!
5191,HERMES,"Just the bureaucrats, Jamaica!"
5192,BUREACRATS (SINGING),Jamaica!
5193,HERMES (SINGING),The grade 19s!
5194,MORGAN,Jamaica.
5195,HERMES (SINGING),Sing me home!
5196,BENDER,"I'm Bender baby, please insert liquor!"
5197,FRY,Yeah!
5198,HERMES,Congratulations.
5199,NUMBER 1.0,Congratulations indeed but you finshed with one second to spare so I'm demoting you. A good bureaucrat never finishes early.
5200,AMY,That's OK Hermes. At least we have you back.
5201,MORGAN,"Not yet you don't. I'm still acting bureaucrat of Planet Express. And I have some changes to make. First, Fry, you're fired. Second -"
5202,HERMES,Not so fast! When I was sortin' I came upon a certain document filed by one Morgan Proctor.  Form B: Notification Of Romantic Entanglement.
5203,FRY,"That's right, she fraternized me!"
5204,MORGAN,That form isn't about you. It refers to my high school prom date. It was a regulation date that ended in regulation disappointment.
5205,HERMES,Yes but you only stamped it four times!
5206,MORGAN,No! No! I was young and reckless.
5207,NUMBER 1.0,Bureaucrat Conrad you are technically correct - the best kind of correct. I hereby promote you to grade 37.  And as for you. (shouting) Guards!  (talking) Bring me the forms I need to fill out to have her taken away!
5208,FARNSWORTH,"Well, it looks like I'll be needing my heroic bureaucrat back. At severely reduced pay of course."
5209,LABARBARA,It's better than nothing!
5210,FRY,What about me? Can I come back at severely reduced pay?
5211,HERMES,"You got it mon! In fact, severely reduced pay all around!  Come on wife, let's blow this joint!"
5212,ZOIDBERG,Now it's time for my song! (singing) When I was two there was a tidal wave in -
5213,THE END,
5214,"""A CLONE OF MY OWN""",
5215,FARNSWORTH,"Good news everyone, the university is bringing me up on disciplinary charges! Wait, that's not good news at all."
5216,LEELA,"Whatever you did Professor, I'm sure there's a reasonable explanation."
5217,FARNSWORTH,"Yes but they won't listen. Everyone's always in favour of saving Hitler's brain but when you put it in the body of a great white shark (sarcastic) ooo, suddenly you've gone too far."
5218,VERNON,"Professor Farnsworth, do you know why we've called you here today?"
5219,FARNSWORTH,"Listen to me you pompous frauds, if I'm going down, I'm taking you all with me. Dean Vernon, I know the truth. It was you driving your hover-car that night, not your horse. Dean Epsilon, I know all about your ""Department Of Pool Boy Studies."" And Dr Wernstrom...Werrrnstrom!"
5220,VERNON,"Actually Professor, we merely called you here to say......surprise."
5221,MAN #1,Surprise!
5222,MAN #2,Happy birthday!
5223,HERMES,Surprise!
5224,FARNSWORTH,"And you Coach Smalley, or should I say ""Coach hairpiece""?"
5225,LEELA,"No Professor, it's a surprise party for your 150th birthday."
5226,FARNSWORTH,(muttering) Hundred and...what? Oooh!
5227,BENDER,"Good evening I'm -  Whoa, sorry. I'm Bender and I'll be MC-ing this roast. Y'know, they say you can judge a man by the company he keeps, so here's the Professor's oldest friend: A grotesque, stinking lobster!"
5228,ZOIDBERG,"Good evening ladies and germs.  That wasn't a joke, I was talking to Dean Streptococcus.  Now I'm not saying Professor Farnsworth is old, but if you consider his age he's likely to die soon!  Hey Ringo, that was the joke. Oh, it's showtime at the Apollo all over again."
5229,BENDER,"Where would the Professor be without students who love and respect him? Right there!  But seriously, of all the former crew members of the Professor's delivery ship, our next speaker is by far the most alive. Captain Muskie?"
5230,ZOIDBERG,I wouldn't wanna follow that guy!
5231,BENDER,"And now, a man who needs no introduction. (whispering) Fry, get up there!"
5232,FRY,"Oh.  Thank you. Y'know, when I was first asked to make a film about my nephew, Professor Farnsworth, I thought ""Why should I?"" Then later Leela made the film. But if I had made the film, you could bet there would have been a lot more topless women on motorcycles! Roll film!"
5233,FRY,(whispering) Dork alert!
5234,BENDER,How 'bout a few words Professor?
5235,FARNSWORTH,Eh wha?
5236,BENDER,"I said ""words."""
5237,FARNSWORTH,"Uh, what a pleasure it is to see my lifetime of accomplishments summed up in a 3-minute film. My best years are behind me. So much left undone. So little time."
5238,BENDER,Funny funny stuff.
5239,FARNSWORTH,My life is over.
5240,LEELA,No it isn't. You have another 10 years left.
5241,FRY,Leela! He could live another 100 years!
5242,LEELA,"No, he couldn't. When you turn 160, robots from the Sunset Squad take you to a mysterious planet and you never return."
5243,FRY,"Wow, a whole planet of old people. Where is it?"
5244,BENDER,(spookily) Nobody knows!
5245,FARNSWORTH,So many loves half-loved. So many inventions half-invented. That damn time machine alone set me back 15 years.
5246,ZOIDBERG,If only it'd worked. You could go back and not waste your time on it.
5247,FARNSWORTH,"There's no one to carry on after I'm gone. No one to take care of my work and my research and my fabulous fortune. By God, that's it! I've got to name a successor."
5248,FRY,A successor?
5249,ZOIDBERG,A successor to the Professor?
5250,FARNSWORTH,There's no time to lose. I'm off to my lab to build a successor-naming machine!
5251,FRY,"Man, the Professor's been in his lab for days."
5252,BENDER,I hope he didn't die. Unless he left a note naming me his successor. Then I hope he did die.
5253,ZOIDBERG,You? The successor? Over my empty shell! The Professor will pick me. Only I have his lobster-like tenacity!
5254,HERMES,Up yours Zoidberg. Up wherever your species traditionally crams things. The only successful way to choose a successor is with a limbo contest.
5255,LEELA,What?
5256,HERMES,"Kingston rules. Two men go down, one come up."
5257,LEELA,"Look, the Professor trusts me with a giant spaceship. He wouldn't trust the rest of you with his dentures."
5258,AMY,Yesh he would.
5259,FRY,Sorry everyone but need I remind you? Blood is thicker than water.
5260,ZOIDBERG [WRITING],Blood...thicker...water.
5261,FARNSWORTH,"Everyone, I have a very dramatic announcement. So anyone with a weak heart should leave now. Goodbye."
5262,LEELA,"Uh, Professor?"
5263,FARNSWORTH,"Oh yes, the announcement! As you all know, I am not long for this world..."
5264,LEELA,"Yes, we know."
5265,HERMES,True mon!
5266,AMY,Buh!
5267,FRY,One foot in the grave.
5268,FARNSWORTH,...So I've picked my successor. It's someone in whom I have great faith - even though his mind is undeveloped and he's accomplished nothing.  My closest living relative...
5269,FRY,Oh yeah!
5270,FARNSWORTH,"My clone, Cubert Farnsworth."
5271,ZOIDBERG,He's horrible!
5272,FRY,Crud. Can I at least be in charge of your dentures?
5273,AMY,You wish!
5274,FRY,Where did Cubert come from?
5275,FARNSWORTH,12 years ago I began the cloning process by removing some skin cells from one of the shaplier growths on my back.
5276,LEELA,"Wait, if he's your clone then why doesn't his nose look like yours?"
5277,FARNSWORTH,I left him in his first tube too long and he got squished up against the side.
5278,BENDER,Is he dumb or just ugly?
5279,FARNSWORTH,Let's find out.
5280,CUBERT,What? You've never seen a genius's wiener before?
5281,ZOIDBERG,No.
5282,LEELA,Never.
5283,FRY,"Well, once in the park."
5284,ZOIDBERG,Mmm!
5285,CUBERT,"As long as I'm going to be in charge here, let me examine my so called ""crew,"" if it can so be called. First of all, Dr Zoidberg, do you even have a medical degree?"
5286,ZOIDBERG,I lost it...in a volcano.
5287,CUBERT,And why do we need a bending robot around here anyway? What possible use do we have for you?
5288,BENDER,Uh...me no speaka the English.
5289,CUBERT,And why does our space pilot have only one eye? There's someone I'd like you to meet. His name is depth perception!
5290,LEELA,Why you little -!
5291,CUBERT,"Wow, that hurt - the air!"
5292,BENDER,Im pending para un bending!
5293,FARNSWORTH,"Oh Cubert, come in here. I have something amazing to show you."
5294,CUBERT,What is it? A compitent employee? I doubt that very much!
5295,FRY,Little twerp.
5296,BENDER,Aye chihuahua!
5297,FARNSWORTH,As my successor I'm trusting you to carry on my work. These are just some of the half finished inventions you'll spend your life finishing.
5298,CUBERT,I didn't realise you were the inventor of the junk heap.
5299,FARNSWORTH,"That's my prizewinning smelloscope. If a dog craps anywhere in the universe, you can bet I won't be out of the loop. And this is my universal translator. Unfortunately so far it only translates into an incomprehensible dead language."
5300,CUBERT,Hello.
5301,UNIVERSAL TRANSLATOR,Bonjour!
5302,FARNSWORTH,Crazy gibberish!
5303,CUBERT,Don't you have any worthwhile inventions?
5304,FARNSWORTH,Why certainly. Step over here.
5305,FARNSWORTH,These are the dark matter engine I invented. They allow my starship to travel between galaxies in mere hours.
5306,CUBERT,That's impossible. You can't go faster than the speed of light.
5307,FARNSWORTH,Of course not. That's why scientists increased the speed of light in 2208.
5308,CUBERT,Also impossible.
5309,FARNSWORTH,And what makes my engines truly remarkable is the afterburner which delivers 200% fuel efficiency.
5310,CUBERT,That's especially impossible.
5311,FARNSWORTH,Not at all. It's very simple.
5312,CUBERT,Then explain it.
5313,FARNSWORTH,Now that's impossible. It came to me in a dream and I forgot it in another dream.
5314,CUBERT,Your explainations are pure weapons grade balognium. It's all impossible.
5315,FARNSWORTH,Nothing is impossible. Not if you can imagine it. That's what being is a scientist is all about.
5316,CUBERT,"No, that's what being a magical elf is all about."
5317,BENDER,"Oh my God, oh my God! It's Elzar, the TV chef! Oh kill me now people!"
5318,ELZAR,How we doing here?
5319,BENDER,"Oh Elzar, everything's so good!"
5320,ELZAR,"What are you, an ass kissing machine?"
5321,BENDER,"Yes sir, good one sir!"
5322,FARNSWORTH,Oh it's a gem of an evening! I feel so wonderful having someone to take over my life work! And it's all thanks to Cubert.
5323,CUBERT,Look Professor. I may be identical to you in every possible way but that doesn't mean I'm anything like you.
5324,FARNSWORTH,You...wha?
5325,CUBERT,I don't want to be an inventor. I want to be something useful like a teacher's aide or a prison guard or a science fiction cartoon writer.
5326,FARNSWORTH,But-But what about my hopes and my dreams and my wonderful inventions?
5327,CUBERT,In your entire life your only half-decent invention was me and I didn't turn out like you wanted either.
5328,ELZAR,You folks still doing alright?
5329,BENDER,Oh yes Elzar.
5330,ELZAR,Good 'cause it turns out I forgot to cook that chicken.
5331,FARNSWORTH,"Bad news everyone. By the time you watch this tape, I'll be gone. Leaving by nothing but a history of failure and my original hipbones. You see, I've been lying about my age. I'm not actually 150. I'm 160. Oh vanity, thy name is Professor Farnsworth. And now that I've nothing to live for, I've alerted the Sunset Squad robots to take me away."
5332,FARNSWORTH,"Goodbye cruel world.  Goodbye cruel lamp.  Goodbye cruel velvet drapes, lined with what would appear to be some sort of cruel muslin......and the cute little pompom curtain pull cords, cruel though they may be a -"
5333,HOLO-FARNSWORTH,"And now that I've nothing to live for, I've alerted the Sunset Squad robots to take me away."
5334,AMY,What?
5335,HERMES,Oh no!
5336,ZOIDBERG,Oh.
5337,HOLO-FARNSWORTH,"I know you're all very upset, especially Bender."
5338,BENDER,"(unmoved) Well, life goes on. Except for you!"
5339,HOLO-FARNSWORTH,I'm sure that Bender has just made a cutting remark but he doesn't know I taped over his soap operas to record this message.
5340,BENDER,You bastard!
5341,FRY,We've gotta get him back.
5342,CUBERT,Impossible. No one knows where they take those old geezers.
5343,FRY,"Nothing is impossible. You'd know that if you really took after the Professor, like I do."
5344,CUBERT,"You're his uncle dummy, he takes after you."
5345,FRY,Uh...what?
5346,CUBERT,"Wait a second, that means I also take after you!"
5347,LEELA,Quiet. I think I know how to find the Professor.
5348,BENDER,Lay it on us big boots.
5349,LEELA,"If the smelloscope can pick up the Professor's odour, we may have a chance to save him."
5350,CUBERT,"I think not. As you probably already don't know, odours are made up of particles that can't travel through the vacuum of space."
5351,LEELA,I'm zeroing in on him.  Bengay...mothballs......letters to the editor. It's the Professor!
5352,BENDER,To the flying machine!
5353,FRY,"To the left!  No to the up!  U-turn, U-turn!"
5354,CUBERT,We'll never find this place. Robots are very good at keeping secrets.
5355,BENDER,No we're not you little bed wetter. Oops I'm sorry.
5356,LEELA,There it is! The Near-Death Star!
5357,LEELA,"OK, we'll tell them the Professor escaped and we're bringing him back. Fry, you'll have to dress up like a 160 year old man."
5358,FRY,I'm on it!
5359,CUBERT,"(sarcastic) My God, the illusion is so perfect I almost forgot I was looking at an idiot!"
5360,LEELA,Now they may ask for a DNA sample.
5361,FRY,I'd like to see them find it!
5362,CUBERT,"This is impossible, we don't even hae a sample of the Professor's DNA."
5363,BENDER,I think I know where to get some.
5364,CUBERT,Why do I have to be the hump?
5365,FRY,'Cause you're too ugly to be a wart.
5366,LEELA,Your medicare dollars at work.
5367,BARRIERBOT #1,Halt! Identify this guest.
5368,LEELA,"Uh, this is Professor Hubert Farnsworth. He escaped."
5369,BARRIERBOT #1,Escaped? No one escapes.
5370,BARRIERBOT #2,This guest does not look 160.
5371,FRY,"What? I'm old. Listen. (old man voice) Hey you kids, get off the lawn!"
5372,BARRIERBOT #1,"Hmm, it is true that old people are often concerned that there are children on their lawns."
5373,BARRIERBOT #2,There's no denying that. But we'll still need to verify his identidity with a DNA sample.
5374,BENDER,Got a hot steaming batch right here!
5375,BARRIERBOT #2,We only need one cell!
5376,BENDER,"Eh, keep the change buddy."
5377,CUBERT,Stupid robot.
5378,BARRIERBOT #1,Did you hump just say something?
5379,FRY,Uh....I-I've got talking hump syndrome.
5380,BARRIERBOT #1,"Ah, THS."
5381,BARRIERBOT #2,Identity confirmed. Return this shambling shuffleboarder to his room.
5382,BARRIERBOT #1,7152 Maple Drive.
5383,LEELA,Sounds nice.
5384,BARRIERBOT #1,Prepare to be surprised.
5385,FRY,So this is where they stick old people. It's horrific.
5386,LEELA,At least it keeps them from driving.
5387,LEELA,Brace yourself for the worst.
5388,BENDER,And yet he looks so natural.
5389,CUBERT,What's happening?
5390,LEELA,"He's hooked up to a life-support system. We have to disconnect him very very carefully, or the shock could kill him."
5391,GUARDBOT #1,Freeze!  Seize them!
5392,GUARDBOT #2,Seize them!
5393,GUARDBOT #3,Seize them!
5394,GUARDBOT #4,Seize them!
5395,GUARDBOT #1,Get them - I mean seize them!
5396,GUARDBOT #2,Aww I'm so bad at this!
5397,GUARDBOT #3,Uh-oh!
5398,LEELA,"We're probably going to make it, but we might not."
5399,CUBERT,"It's impossible, we'll never fit."
5400,FRY,Will too.
5401,CUBERT,Told you.
5402,FRY,"Come on Leela, step your big boot down on the gas pedal."
5403,LEELA,They've blown out one of our engines!
5404,FRY,Fix it fix it fix it fix it fix it fix it! Fix it fix it fix it!
5405,LEELA,Only the Professor knows how to fix it. We have to wake him up.
5406,FRY,Try shocking him.
5407,BENDER,(shouting) Your social security cheque is late! Stuff costs more than it used to. Young people use curse words!
5408,FRY,"Damnit, we'll have to fix the engine ourself."
5409,LEELA,"We can't you bastard, no one knows how it works. It's impossible."
5410,CUBERT,Nothing is impossible. I understand how the engines work now. It came to me in a dream.  The engines don't move the ship at all. The ship stays where it is and the engines move the universe around it.
5411,BENDER,That's a complete load.
5412,CUBERT,Nothing's a complete load. Not if you can imagine it. That's what being a scientist is all about. Right Professor?
5413,FARNSWORTH,Eh...whuh...
5414,CUBERT,Let's ride!
5415,CUBERT,"Good news everyone, he's made a complete recovery."
5416,AMY,Yeah!
5417,HERMES,Wow!
5418,LEELA,All right!
5419,FARNSWORTH,I'm as spry as a 140 year old.  See? I only broke one ankle.
5420,FRY,So what were they doing to you in that awful drawer?
5421,FARNSWORTH,"Oh, they had me hooked up to a bizarre virtual world that seemed absolutely real."
5422,AMY,What was it like?
5423,FARNSWORTH,"It was as though I was living in a facility in Florida with hundreds of other old people. All day long we'd play bingo, eat oatmeal and wait for our children to call."
5424,LEELA,It's a hundred times more horrible than anything I could imagine.
5425,FARNSWORTH,"Oh my yes. Thank you all for saving me. Especially you my little clone. No matter what you decide to do with your life, I'm still proud of you."
5426,CUBERT,"I've already decided. Dad, when I grow up I wanna be just like you."
5427,FARNSWORTH,"Don't worry son. You will. Incidentally, you might want to read up on a condition known as ""wandering bladder."""
5428,CUBERT,Why?
5429,FARNSWORTH,No reason. No reason at all.
5430,THE END,
5431,"""THE DEEP SOUTH""",
5432,HERMES,"Exciting news, people! The pet licence I requsitioned for Nibbler has arrived."
5433,LEELA,"Hermes, that's sweet. I didn't know you cared about Nibbler."
5434,HERMES,"Dream on, woman. I'd like to put the little bastard in a sack and toss the sack in a river and hurl the river into space. But I do like filling out requisitions and these were some doozies!  Great Jah's dreadlocks! There's been a mix-up. This isn't a pet licence, it's a fishing licence. And it's mandatory!"
5435,FARNSWORTH,Ah! The exact centre of the Atlantic Ocean. This seems the logical place for fish to congregate.
5436,BENDER,So we're in international waters?
5437,FARNSWORTH,Indeed so.
5438,BENDER,"Falcon, this is Blue Raven, the goose has nested. Repeat, the goose has nested. Hey, guess what you're accessories to?"
5439,LEELA,"The sun, the sea air, good friends."
5440,BENDER,"Leela's right, fishing blows. Whattya say we make it interesting?"
5441,HERMES,Why not?
5442,AMY,Yeah.
5443,FARNSWORTH,"Yeah, cool."
5444,BENDER,"Everybody kick in five bucks.  There, wasn't that interesting?"
5445,LEELA,Bender!
5446,FRY,This contest is as good as over. I once caught a fish this big.
5447,BENDER,"Oh, yeah? I once caught a fish this big!"
5448,LEELA,"I'm afraid you're both out of your league, boys, 'cause you're looking at a woman who owns her own harpoon."
5449,BENDER,"Harpoon, my ass!"
5450,LEELA,
5451,HERMES,"Let's see now, which bait to use?  Crickets? Squid? Chicken necks?"
5452,ZOIDBERG,"Excuse me, if I might be so bold, I'm willing to offer my services as a bait critic.  These sardines for example are bland and tasteless.  And these dry, stringy nightcrawlers, though juicy ...  ... very very juicy--"
5453,HERMES,"I don't believe this! It's eating my bait!  Beat it, you mooching crawdad!"
5454,BENDER,"Hey, Fry, check out my laser-guided fishing rod."
5455,FRY,"(whispering) Quiet, Bender, you're scaring away the fish."
5456,BENDER,Fine. I'll head over to the other side. (shouting) Good luck fishing on this side!
5457,FRY,I can hit a fish between the eyes from 20 yards!
5458,BENDER,"Oh, yeah? I can hit a shrimp!"
5459,FRY,A shrimp?  I find it a bit hard to believe that--
5460,LEELA,"Aha!  Gather round, chumps! I got the winner!"
5461,AMY,"Oh, so this is where you shop for your boots?"
5462,BENDER,Couple more of those and you'll have yourself a fish stick!
5463,FRY,"Hey, a fish this fine belongs in a fish nugget-style chunklet. And anyway, it's bigger than anything you've caught. Ow! My small intestine!"
5464,LEELA,"Bingo! Whatever it is, it's 20 times heavier than a boot."
5465,FARNSWORTH,You'll never catch anything with that primitive technology. What you need is this fish pheromone.  The most potent aphrodisiac known to fishkind.  Uh-oh!
5466,ZOIDBERG,(sexfully) I'm so into you!
5467,FARNSWORTH,"Oh, my!"
5468,FRY,"(shouting) Hey, Bender, I just caught a fish this big!"
5469,BENDER,"Quit exaggerating, Fry. Ah, screw this! If I'm not gonna catch a fish, I might as well not catch a big fish.  There. Like most of life's problems this one can be solved with bending."
5470,FARNSWORTH,"Bender, be careful. That's the ships diamond filament tether. It's unbreakable."
5471,BENDER,Then why do I have to be careful?
5472,FARNSWORTH,It belonged to my grandmother.
5473,HERMES,My manwich!
5474,LEELA,"Wake up, everyone! I've got something. And this time it's alive!  Dr. Zoidberg, since when do you even wear boots?"
5475,ZOIDBERG,I wasn't wearing it. (ashamed) I was eating it.
5476,LEELA,"Come on, let's go home."
5477,AMY,Sunburn! My fabulous body! It's ruined! What happened to my parasol?
5478,BENDER,I don't know. It wasn't here when I took your umbrella.  What? I put sunblock on you.
5479,AMY,Well it didn't work!
5480,LEELA,"Come on, Bender. Pull in your line and let's go."
5481,BENDER,"Hey, I'm snagged."
5482,FARNSWORTH,"It's not snagged, the mechano man has caught something!  Sweet Zombie Jesus! It's huge!"
5483,AMY,It's coming up!
5484,HERMES,"Oh, that's big!"
5485,FARNSWORTH,A colossal-mouth bass!
5486,FRY,It's diving!
5487,LEELA,It's pulling us under! Everyone into the ship!
5488,ZOIDBERG,"Wait! I'll save us! By cutting the unbreakable diamond filament!  Well, at least I'll die with my friends. Hello?"
5489,HERMES,(from ship) My Speedos!
5490,LEELA,"Depth at 45 hundred feet, 48 hundred, 50 hundred! 5000 feet!"
5491,FARNSWORTH,"Dear Lord, that's over 150 atmospheres of pressure."
5492,FRY,How many atmospheres can this ship withstand?
5493,FARNSWORTH,"Well it's a spaceship, so I'd say anywhere between zero and one."
5494,BENDER,What's that? Is someone bending girders?
5495,LEELA,We'll be crushed if we don't equalise the pressure.
5496,FRY,How do we do that?
5497,FARNSWORTH,That should do it.
5498,AMY,We're all gonna die!
5499,FRY,"Wait, I'll be back in a minute."
5500,LEELA,"You did it, Fry!"
5501,FRY,Did what?
5502,BENDER,"People, it's far far worse than we thought; My fish got away."
5503,LEELA,"There, good as new! Except we're three miles below the surface, we don't have any food and the ship won't work underwater."
5504,BENDER,(restrained) Tempers are wearing thin. Let's just hope some robot doesn't kill everybody.
5505,HERMES,"The important thing is that we don't panic. There are rules for situations like this.  Now, the first order of business is lunch. I suggest a nice lobster Zoidberg, I mean lobster Newburg, I mean Doctor Zoidberg."
5506,LEELA,"OK, everyone, calm down. The Professor and I will get to work on the ship. Bender, Zoidberg, since you can survive underwater, you'll go out and look for food."
5507,FRY,I'd better go too. They don't know what I like.
5508,HERMES,"Fry, no! The pressure will crush you like a green snake under a sugarcane truck."
5509,FARNSWORTH,Not necessarily. This is chance for Fry to test out my experimental anti-pressure pill.
5510,FRY,I can't swallow that.
5511,FARNSWORTH,Well then good news! It's a suppository.
5512,ZOIDBERG,"How are you doing there, Fry?  Glad to hear it.  Aha!"
5513,BENDER,"Aw, yeah!"
5514,ZOIDBERG,"Yum, yum, yum!  Uh-oh!  Look at me, I'm Dr. Zoidberg, homeowner!"
5515,ZOIDBERG,"Careful, Fry, I think that flag might be poisonous."
5516,BENDER,"Ahoy, mateys! I shanghaied us some hearty grub.  Arr! The laws o' science be a harsh mistress!"
5517,ZOIDBERG,"Say, robot, old buddy? Could you help me move a couch?"
5518,BENDER,"Uh, OK, but I'm not carrying it upstairs."
5519,ZOIDBERG,"What is it, Fry?"
5520,FRY,(blubberling) Mermaid.
5521,BENDER,You want some lemonade? You saw a big parade?
5522,ZOIDBERG,"Your student loans have been repaid? Then how 'bout lending your old pal Zoidberg a few bucks, Mr Millionaire!"
5523,LEELA,"Fry, swallow your food. Then talk."
5524,FRY,A mermaid!
5525,AMY,You think you saw a mermaid?
5526,FRY,"No, I did see a mermaid! She was wearing a tube top and she had a beautiful scaley tail. And I think she had hair extensions."
5527,BENDER,"Yeah, right!"
5528,LEELA,Sure she did.
5529,HERMES,"OK, Fry!"
5530,FARNSWORTH,"You're simply hallucinating, you ... moron."
5531,FRY,"What's so far-fetched about mermaids? I mean, there's all sorts of weird sea creatures here in the future. Like Dr. Zoidberg."
5532,LEELA,I'm afraid Fry is suffering from ocean madness.
5533,FRY,"Every time something good happens to me you say it's some kind of madness, or I'm drunk, or I ate too much candy. Well I saw a real mermaid and I wish for once my friends would have decency and kindness to believe me."
5534,LEELA,(whispering) Ocean madness.
5535,FARNSWORTH,He may have ocean madness but that's no excuse for ocean rudeness.
5536,FRY,"(muttering) Ocean madness, yeah right. It's always something, ain't it?  (talking) It's her! Bender, wake up! She's here! Wake up!  Oh! oxygen!"
5537,MERMAID,"Here you go, darlin'."
5538,FRY,"Hey! I can breath and talk, just like a fish!"
5539,MERMAID,"Oh, you speak fish?"
5540,FRY,What?
5541,MERMAID,"I'm sorry, my accent's atrocious. Hi, my name's Umbriel!"
5542,FRY,"I'm Fry. So, uh, am I gonna drown?"
5543,UMBRIEL,Course not. Just stay calm and let the currents relax your every muscle.
5544,FRY,"Aw, yeah!"
5545,UMBRIEL,Did it just get warmer?
5546,FRY,I can't believe you're really real. I like your tail.
5547,UMBRIEL,"Oh, you're sweet. I like those wiggly doo-dads comin' outta your hips."
5548,FRY,"Oh, Thanks. They're called pants."
5549,UMBRIEL,This here's a volcanic vent. The water comes out at over 4000 degrees.
5550,FRY,No kidding.
5551,UMBRIEL,Did it just get colder?  Tell me more about that bizarre land-y world you come from. Is there water there too?
5552,FRY,"Sure, sometimes it falls from the sky."
5553,UMBRIEL,Hm.
5554,FRY,And sometimes it doesn't.
5555,UMBRIEL,"Oh, Mr. Fry! You do go on!"
5556,FRY,"You know what I like best about you, Umbriel? You find me fascinating even when I'm not claiming to be a jewel thief or a lion tamer."
5557,UMBRIEL,Lions? There are sealions on the land?
5558,FRY,Yup. We call them land-sealions ... I tame them!
5559,FARNSWORTH,I'm almost finish reconfiguring the ships propulsion system. We can leave as soon as the paper-mâché is dry.
5560,LEELA,Where's Fry?
5561,BENDER,I didn't kill him. Professor?
5562,FARNSWORTH,"No, I've been busy."
5563,HERMES,He must've gone out looking for that mermaid. The poor demented honky.
5564,LEELA,"It's ocean madness alright. Sailors call it aqua dementia, the deep down crazies, the wet willies, the screaming moist!"
5565,FARNSWORTH,"We'll form a search party. Now, we'll need oxygen."
5566,BENDER,"I got it covered.  In the event of an emergency, my ass can be used as a floatation device."
5567,FARNSWORTH,"Ooh, that reminds me: You've all taken your pressure pills, right?"
5568,AMY,Yes! Stop asking!
5569,ZOIDBERG,I've got his scent! Over here where the water gets warmer. This way!
5570,BENDER,(awestruck) Bend me!
5571,AMY,Dude! An ancient sunken city!
5572,FARNSWORTH,Could it possibly be? Are the old legends true?  It is! It's the fabled lost city of Atlanta!
5573,MERMAN,"Howdy, y'all!"
5574,COLONEL,"Welcome to Atlanta. Folks round these parts call me the Colonel.  Here, have some breathers, courtesy of our Chamber of Commerce."
5575,FARNSWORTH,"This is uncomfortable and humiliating. Now, if they could put it in the form of a suppository."
5576,COLONEL,"Y'all enjoy your stay! Tourism's our main source of income round here so see the sights, spend some money. Please don't leave!"
5577,BENDER,"Fry! Oh, I just knew you were still alive! (whispering) I owe you 10 bucks, Hermes!"
5578,FRY,"Hey, you guys, the most amazing thing happened. It's two-for-one Tuesday at Krispy Kreme! Plus there's mermaids."
5579,COLONEL,"Nice out of town folks, I'd like you to meet my daughter, Umbriel. Umbriel, these are some Yankees."
5580,AMY,"So, Fry, Atlanta was an American city in your time?"
5581,FRY,I think it was just an airport. They had a place where you could buy nuts.
5582,UMBRIEL,"No! Ancient Atlanta was more than just a Delta hub. It was a vibrant metropolis, the equal of Paris or New York."
5583,FRY,"That's right, honey! Whatever you say."
5584,UMBRIEL,"Look at these fabulous ruins. Turner Field, the Coca-Cola bottling plant, the, uh, the airport."
5585,LEELA,"But tell us: How could a city with such a ... fabulous airport, end up underwater?"
5586,COLONEL,"Ah, now that's a story that can only rightly be told in a Chamber of Commerce video narrated by folk-rock trubadour Donovan."
5587,DONOVAN,"Atlanta was a city, landlocked, hundreds of miles from the area we now call the Atlantic Ocean,"
5588,MERMAIDS,Hail Atlanta!
5589,LEELA,The magician?
5590,BENDER,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wouldn't it take millions of years to evolve into mermaids?"
5591,UMBRIEL,"Normally, yes, but the caffine really sped things up.  That stuff's wonderful."
5592,COLONEL,"So when Umbriel first brought home this carpet bagger, I was again' it. But, damnit, if old legs here ain't grown on me!"
5593,FRY,"Aw, shucks, Colonel."
5594,HERMES,"Well, it's all very nice here but we should be going. I miss me wife and me oxygen."
5595,FARNSWORTH,"Yes, we all miss our loved ones and gases. Come on, Fry."
5596,FRY,Wait. I'm not going with you.
5597,LEELA,"But, Fry, what about us? What about your life on the surface? You don't belong down here."
5598,ZOIDBERG,"She's right, I mean sure they got the Braves but it's a third-rate symphony."
5599,FARNSWORTH,"Fry, you half-mad, half-insane maniac, be reasonable. Don't you realise that if you stay at this depth your body will permanently adapt to the pressure?"
5600,FRY,Realise it? I don't even understand it!
5601,FARNSWORTH,It means you'll never be able to return to the surface.
5602,FRY,I don't care. I'm staying. I've got everything I want right here.
5603,FARNSWORTH,(shouting) I'm bored! Let's go!
5604,ZOIDBERG,"You know, Fry, I've got a little place just outside town. You could come visit, maybe?"
5605,FRY,"Sorry, Zoidberg. I'm trying to join the country club."
5606,BENDER,"(crying) Oh, Fry!  I'll miss you!"
5607,COLONEL,"Y'all come back now, y'hear?"
5608,FARNSWORTH,"(shouting) Let's go, damnit! Let's go!"
5609,ZOIDBERG,"Well, I guess this is goodbye for me as well."
5610,LEELA,Whatever.
5611,AMY,Later.
5612,FARNSWORTH,Bye.
5613,ZOIDBERG,No! My home! It burned down!  (crying) How did this happen?
5614,HERMES,That's a very good question.
5615,BENDER,So that's where I left my cigar.
5616,HERMES,That just raises further questions!
5617,FRY,"You know, Umbriel, these last 24 hours have been the happiest days of my life."
5618,UMBRIEL,"Oh, Fry! I want you to make a mer-woman outta mer-me."
5619,FRY,Mercy! I do believe I'm gettin' the vapours!
5620,UMBRIEL,What the hell is that?
5621,FRY,Yeah I'm a little confused too. How do I ... y'know ... with the tail and all?
5622,UMBRIEL,"I'm not your first am I? I mean, I-I lay my eggs and leave and you release your fertiliser."
5623,FRY,"(gasping) Why couldn't she be the other type of mermaid, with the fish part on top and the lady part on the bottom?"
5624,UMBRIEL,Now who's gonna escort me to the Debutante Ball?
5625,COLONEL,Well what about that rich young dugong from Macon?
5626,FARNSWORTH,There! The engine modifications are complete.
5627,LEELA,Prepare for launch.
5628,FRY,Wait! Wait for me! Don't leave me here!
5629,POOPENMEYER,"And so, in honour of his record-breaking catch, I'm proud to award Bender this cheque for $1000."
5630,LEELA,It's you!
5631,BENDER,"Hey, buddy!"
5632,HERMES,My manwich!
5633,LEELA,"Fry, are you alright? What happened?"
5634,AMY,What about Umbriel?
5635,FRY,"Well, it turns out I loved her, but I wasn't in love with her."
5636,AMY,(whispering) Trouble in bed.
5637,BENDER,"Ah, it's great to have you back, buddy."
5638,POOPENMEYER,Wait a-- This is no record! Gimmie back that cheque! I'm giving it to some giant orphans.
5639,FRY,"Ow! Bender, you're hurting me. Ow!"
5640,ZOIDBERG,Hey! I'm trying to sleep in here!
5641,THE END,
5642,DONOVAN,(over credits) Hail Atlanta!
5643,"""BENDER GETS MADE""",
5644,BENDER,"Wow! I'm finally gonna see my favourite chef, TV's Elzar. Oh this is the greatest nanosecond of my life. No, this one is - no, this one. Wait...that one was slightly worse. Ah, so far so good on this one."
5645,BENDER,Yeah!  Alright! Yeah baby!
5646,MAN,Elzar!  Alright!
5647,BENDER,"Elzar, you're my god. Please sign this sketch I drew of you."
5648,ELZAR,"Now, this is why I prefer your non-stick robots."
5649,BENDER,"(disappointed) Oh.  (normal) Alright, yeah!  (quietly) Alright, yeah!"
5650,ELZAR,"Hey, I hope you folks like Cajun food. 'Cause today we're making Elzar's down-home Neptune-style gumbo. Now, step one. You'll wanna boil some oysters in a pot of down-home Neptune-style gumbo."
5651,BENDER,(loudly) Boiled? Interesting.
5652,LEELA,"(whispering) Bender, please try to be a little quieter."
5653,BENDER,"No, you shut up."
5654,ELZAR,"Of course, every now and then you'll wanna knock it up a notch with a blast from your spice weasel.  Bam!"
5655,BENDER,"Oh yeah, bam it again Elzar. Knock it up another notch!"
5656,ELZAR,"Jeez, who let this guy through the metal detector?"
5657,BENDER,Come on you wimp. Work that weasel. Quit holding out on us.
5658,ELZAR,"If you promise to stop interrupting alright. Against my will, I'm gonna knock it up another notch."
5659,BENDER,"I gotta get this notch-up knocking on film.  Hey Elzar, think fast."
5660,ELZAR,"What, huh?"
5661,LEELA,Ow! My eye! I'm blind!
5662,BENDER,Bam!
5663,HATTIE,"Tell me doctor, how's my cyst?"
5664,HATTIE'S DOCTOR,Grande.
5665,ZOIDBERG,I don't like the look of this doctor. I bet I've lost more patients than he's even treated.
5666,DOCTOR,OK. What does this look like?
5667,LEELA,Um...a grey-ish blob?
5668,DOCTOR,Right.  And this one?
5669,LEELA,Um...a grey-ish blob?
5670,DOCTOR,Not as right that time. It looks like you might have some mild corneal irritation.
5671,ZOIDBERG,Nice try little boy. You might have your textbook knowledge and your real diploma but I have more skill in my little claw than you have in your whole carapace.
5672,DOCTOR,You seem a bit tense.  Here try these.
5673,ZOIDBERG,"Sure, butter me up with candy. But it won't work sonny!  (dazed) Why always the fighting?"
5674,DOCTOR,Your eye just needs some rest. You'll have to wear this patch for about a week.
5675,LEELA,A week? What do you think Dr Zoidberg?
5676,ZOIDBERG,(dazed) Clack.
5677,ZOIDBERG,(dazed) Thanks for the help Leela.
5678,AMY,"(shouting) Leela, we're right here."
5679,LEELA,I'm not deaf. I just have to wear this stupid eye patch. Does it look stupid?
5680,FRY,"No. In fact, it looks so nice I think I might get one too."
5681,BENDER,It's Elzar again! Oh my God I'm so excited I wish I could wet my pants.
5682,ELZAR,"Leela, please, let me make this up to you. You and your friends are all invited to my restaurant tonight. I'm gonna bam you up a dinner you'll never forget."
5683,AMY,(cheering) Alright!
5684,FRY,(cheering) Yeah!
5685,BENDER,(cheering) Hooray for blindy!
5686,ZOIDBERG,Oh God. I'm coming dowwwn!
5687,ELZAR,Folks tell the neighbours to watch your mouth 'cause your tastebuds are going on vacation. I made you each your own special meal so dig in!
5688,HERMES,"It's the biggest Jamaican platter I've ever seen. Jerk chicken, jerk beef, jerk pork. Is there any meat this man can't jerk?"
5689,ZOIDBERG,"The king crab is to die for! Look, a tiny edible crown!"
5690,AMY,What's it made of?
5691,ZOIDBERG [EATING],Wood!
5692,BENDER,"Oh Fry, you gotta try this sterno-nicoise!"
5693,FRY,No thanks. That's robot food.
5694,BENDER,It's so good. Oh just try a little!
5695,FRY,No really I don't -  Mmm!
5696,AMY,You doing alright over there Leela?
5697,LEELA,"Oh yeah, this salad's fantastic.  So fresh."
5698,FARNSWORTH,Oh my. That steamed carrot was a bit spicy for me.
5699,ELZAR,Everybody enjoy their dinner?
5700,LEELA,Are you kidding me?
5701,AMY,Uh-huh.
5702,BENDER,"God, yes Elzar."
5703,ELZAR,"Well, I enjoyed cooking for you. And just to make everything completely square, I want you to have these complimentary after-dinner chocolates."
5704,HERMES,What's this under the chocolates?
5705,ELZAR,"Yeah, you take care of that whenever you want."
5706,HERMES,Hey.
5707,AMY,A bill?
5708,LEELA,You're charging us? After you blinded me?
5709,ELZAR,Hey I made you a nice meal. This ain't a charity.
5710,FRY,$1200?
5711,FARNSWORTH,Holy Zombie Jesus!
5712,HERMES,We don't have that kind of money. Especially not Zoidberg.
5713,ZOIDBERG,They took away my credit card.
5714,ELZAR,"OK OK wait. I know how to take care of this, no problem."
5715,URL,You deadbeats are under arrest. It's a stone cold shame.
5716,SMITTY,He's making a break for it. Get him!
5717,FRY,"No, I was just picking my nose."
5718,SMITTY,He's picking his nose. Get him!
5719,SMITTY,The old dine-and-dash huh? My daddy owned a restaurant and it's punks like you who kept it from going regional. That's why I became a cop.
5720,URL,Now it's payback time. Aww yeah.
5721,ZOIDBERG,Please don't hit me. I'm brittle.
5722,BENDER,Hey wait a second. I've got the perfect solution.
5723,ZOIDBERG,Listen to the smart robot.
5724,BENDER,I love cooking and Elzar's ass likes getting kissed right?
5725,ELZAR,No question.
5726,BENDER,"So, how 'bout I work part time at the restaurant to pay off our debt?"
5727,ELZAR,I don't know. I usually hire people who are a little less unbearable.
5728,HERMES,"Oh, Bender's a model employee."
5729,AMY,He's so polite.
5730,LEELA,And hard working.
5731,FRY,He's made of candy.
5732,ELZAR,"OK, fine, I'll give it a shot."
5733,FRY,(cheering) Alright!
5734,HERMES,(cheering) Yes!
5735,BENDER,Hot diggety!
5736,SMITTY,You'd better keep your nose clean.
5737,BENDER,That'll be easy. I never wear the damn thing.
5738,HERMES,Ah. Time for my precious 10am meeting. Where in Legoland is Leela?
5739,LEELA,I'm here and I'm getting along just fine thank you. My walk to work today just took a little longer than usual. Nibbler took me through the zoo for some reason.
5740,AMY,"Leela, a little help is nothing to be embarrassed about. Like, maybe I could do your makeup."
5741,LEELA,I don't need help. For you information I did this all by myself.
5742,FARNSWORTH,"You look beautiful. Incidentally, my favourite artist is Picasso."
5743,BENDER,"Well, I'm off to work at the restaurant. One of you will have to fill in for me while I'm gone."
5744,FARNSWORTH,"Better yet, I'll build someone to fill in for you.  Some kind of gamma powered mechanical monster, with freeway on-ramps for arms and a heart as black as coal..."
5745,BENDER,"Well, if that new give can't handle thing, gimmie a call."
5746,BENDER,"I'm done siphoning out the grease trap. I think I need a mint.  So uh, what job do I move up to? Pastry chef? Saucier? Soup guy?"
5747,ELZAR,Bam!
5748,BENDER,"(muttering) Bam yourself!  (talking) Hey, who are they?"
5749,ELZAR,Let's just say they're very good customers and I'm not answering anymore questions.
5750,BENDER,Are they the robot mafia?
5751,ELZAR,Yes.
5752,DONBOT,You call this a table? You call this a table? I wouldn't hit a guy over the head with this table.
5753,CLAMPS,You hear that? The Donbot don't like it. I oughta clamp you - you wanna be clamped?
5754,JOEY,"Whoa whoa, calm down Clamps.  The boss, he likes a wall up which his back can be put against. Such as like this there."
5755,WAITRESS,But that table's already -
5756,BENDER,"Uh, let me bus that for you gentlemen. No, what I meant to do was..."
5757,WOMAN,Oh!
5758,MAN,I can't believe this!
5759,BENDER,Mind your own business and get out!
5760,DONBOT,Huh. I like this guy's lack of style.
5761,CLAMPS,"...So I finally get this guy a pair of cement shoes which he likes, 'cause they're lighter than his lead ones."
5762,DONBOT,Hey. You think this computes over here? Where's all my change? I gave you a hundred.
5763,BENDER,No you gave me a fifty.
5764,DONBOT,Oh no I didn't.
5765,BENDER,Yeah you did.
5766,CLAMPS,"Hey, you tryin' to steal from the Donbot?"
5767,BENDER,I'm tryin' but he's not makin' it easy.
5768,DONBOT,"Get a load of the ball bearings on this guy, huh. I like you kid. Here's something for your trouble.  (whispering) It's money."
5769,BENDER,Wow thanks.
5770,DONBOT,"Hey, you earned that 50 bucks."
5771,BENDER,You gave me a twenty.
5772,DONBOT,"I did?  Oh I'm sorry I meant to - hey wait a minute.  I got a good feeling about you. Say, you wanna work for me as a hired goon?"
5773,BENDER,"Are you kidding? I've always wanted to break into gooning!  (shouting) Hey Elzar, I quit."
5774,DONBOT,"We're gonna try you out with a little delivery job. It's for a uh, private lottery that we run."
5775,BENDER,"Wow, you guys run numbers?!"
5776,CLAMPS,"Well, nothing fancy. Just ones and zeros mostly."
5777,DONBOT,"Just take this disk over to the pool hall and give it to Sammy ""The Mechanical Bull"" Gravano. And watch out for the cops."
5778,BENDER,That's just what my mom used to tell me.
5779,BENDER,That's some fine oil-ade son. We could use a man like you in the Robot Mafia which I'm sorta in.
5780,TINNY TIM,You flatter me kind goon. But I'm only programmed to sell oil-ade and write in cute backwards letters like on the sign here.
5781,BENDER,"Aw crap, the cops."
5782,SMITTY,Seen any suspicious activity?
5783,URL,Nope. But check out today's Marmaduke. Solid!
5784,SMITTY,Hey. It's that skell from Elzar's.
5785,URL,Undercover pursuit in progress...baby.
5786,SMITTY,Gotcha!
5787,BENDER,What seems to be the problem officers? Was I speeding?
5788,SMITTY,We'll decide what you were doing after an illegal search.
5789,URL,He's clean.  Smells nice too.
5790,SMITTY,Better than me?
5791,URL,Aww yeah.
5792,TINNY TIM,Courtesy of Mr Bender.
5793,DONBOT,"Nice job Bender, you passed the test. You wanna joi me, Clamps and Joey Mousepad at out uh, social club tomorrow night?"
5794,BENDER,"Uh, I'd rather plan some fellonies."
5795,DONBOT,Oh. Then we should meet at our Mafia crime headquarters.
5796,ROBOT,"Donbot, I beg you, I can't make this week's loan payment. Look into your hard drive and open your mercy file."
5797,DONBOT,File not found.  Let that be a warning to you.
5798,ROBOT,Thank you Donbot.
5799,BENDER,"Joey, Clamps, Donny B!"
5800,DONBOT,"Hey listen Bender. We got a big score planned but uh, we need some muscle."
5801,BENDER,A little of this huh?
5802,JOEY,"Ho ho, this guy's an ox! He's got oxon-like strength! Hey, he needs a nickname right? Let's call him Clamps."
5803,CLAMPS,Clamps? That's my name you numbskull! Don't make me clamp you one!
5804,BENDER,"How 'bout ""Blotto""? It's witty, it's got street cred. Plus I can keep my monogrammed slippers."
5805,JOEY,"Good thinking! Hey hey! Now, this score ain't gonna be no cake walk in the tea park alright, there may be some death killing."
5806,CLAMPS,"It's gonna be clamp this, clamp that, bada-climp, bada-clamp."
5807,DONBOT,What d'you think Blotto? You in?
5808,BENDER,It's funny. Until now I always wanted to be a gangster...so the answer's yes.
5809,CLAMPS,Yeah!
5810,JOEY,Hey hey! Way to go way to be way to shoot!
5811,DONBOT,"Now since we're committing crimes that may be against the law, I suggest you have an alibi."
5812,BENDER,An alibi huh?
5813,FRY,But we're about to take off. We gotta eat our blastoff sundaes.
5814,FRY [FROM OUTSIDE],OK you stay in bed. I'll eat yours.
5815,FRY,Bender's sick.  Need any help taking off?
5816,LEELA,I'm fine thank you. A real pilot can navigate by feel alone.
5817,HERMES,That's coming outta your pay!
5818,BENDER,You know the secret of traditional robot cooking? Start with a good high-quality oil...then eat it. So whats this big score anyway?
5819,DONBOT,We're heisting a shipment of Zuban cigars.
5820,BENDER,Zubans? Those are the finest cigars in the universe. I can stink up a hole maternity ward with one of those things.
5821,JOEY,Yo there's our pigeon now. Let's shoot bullets out of our guns.
5822,DONBOT,"Alright, here's the battleplan: We shoot, they surrender, we go aboard, somebody does some clamping then we heist the cigars and go home."
5823,BENDER,And all without killing anyone.  This gang's got some fresh new ideas. I admire that.
5824,JOEY,"Oh, we'll kill 'em alright."
5825,CLAMPS,We got 'em heavily out-clamped. They won't know what clamped 'em!
5826,FRY,"Wow, it's too bad you can't see Leela 'cause theres a cool ship out there shooting at somebody."
5827,LEELA,I'm taking evasive action.
5828,FRY,"Uh, Leela?"
5829,LEELA,"Stop bothering me Fry, I need full concentration."
5830,COMPUTER VOICE,Missile evaded.
5831,LEELA,Eyesight is for chumps.
5832,DONBOT,"Their desire to keep living shows me no respect. Hey Blotto, roll down the window and start shooting."
5833,BENDER,"Um, uh, um.  (fake hurt) Ooh ow! He got me! Ow, what a shot that guy is."
5834,LEELA,"Wait. Why do the raised letters that normally say ""Turnmaster Steering company"" say ""Nibbler""? Oh no!"
5835,LEELA [ON SCREEN],I'm back at the wheel Fry. Everything's under control.
5836,FRY,"Great, great. The one time I forgot to buy flight insurance."
5837,JOEY,They're coming straight towards our proximity. Maybe you should give 'em the clamps Clamps.
5838,CLAMPS,Gee you think? You think that maybe I should use these clamps that I use every day at every opportunity? (shouting) You're a freaking genius you idiot!
5839,LEELA,The engine's stalled. I'm trying the manual fuel pump.
5840,DONBOT,"Hello, we're the Robot Mafia. The entire Robot Mafia. We're here to steal your cigars."
5841,LEELA,You'll never get away with this.
5842,FRY,Unless you let us live. Then you'll get off scot free.
5843,DONBOT,"Joey, Clamps, hurry and blindfold them before they see us some more."
5844,JOEY,"Hey boss, looks like somebody beat us to it."
5845,LEELA,"I'll assume that's a joke at my expense. Well, who's laughing now? Heyya!"
5846,DONBOT,Hey where's Blotto? He should be here learning the trade.
5847,BENDER,"Sorry I'm tardy old bean, I was just enjoying a rather tasty watercress sandwich."
5848,DONBOT,Hey. He's more classy than I realised. Tie up the prisoners.
5849,BENDER,"Capital idea old sport.  I say, get the hell off me!"
5850,LEELA,(whispering) That guy sounds familiar.
5851,BENDER,"My word, what have we -  Uh, nothing to see here old girl."
5852,JOEY,"Hey boss, this here crew list lists a robot on this crew here."
5853,DONBOT,Alright. I want you to find him and plug him. Then unplug him.
5854,FRY,No!
5855,CLAMPS,I got a little surprise in store for that guy. The clamps! Eh?
5856,BENDER,"Uh wait, old...spice. Let me have a go at this mechanised chap. I can be quite the rough customer."
5857,FRY,"(whispering) Oh no, poor Bender."
5858,BENDER,(fake voice) ...Take that you twit. (normal voice) No! Stop it!
5859,DONBOT,"That's the last of 'em.  Alright now let's Mafia things up a little.  Joey, burn down the ship. Clamps, burn down the crew."
5860,BENDER,"Uh, hey Donny, baby, gimmie a chance here huh? Yous guys skidaddle. Let me take care of the doity woik."
5861,DONBOT,"Hey, I like your attitude. And your latest accent. Keep it up and I might just get you your own pair of clamps huh?"
5862,CLAMPS,(muttering) He's gonna get clamps? Clamps clamps......clamps clamps!
5863,BENDER,Phew.
5864,FRY,"Leela, we may not have much time left......so let's spend all of it reminscing about Bender. He was like a big computer than ran on magic."
5865,BENDER,"Uh, help! Help!"
5866,LEELA,Bender!
5867,FRY,You're OK!
5868,BENDER,Yes I am. Having just this minute regained consciousness.
5869,LEELA,"I've got an idea. Hold still.  It's about to break, yes, yes!"
5870,LEELA,(cheering) Alright!
5871,BENDER,Yeah it broke alright
5872,FRY,"I'm telling you, Leela was cool, she was in command, and when she kicked people it hurt. It really hurt."
5873,LEELA,"Well, this is the big moment. It's finally time to take my patch off."
5874,ZOIDBERG,I'll handle the snipping. Afterall I do have the proper equipment.
5875,LEELA,I think it's Blotto. That gangster I saw when my patch fell off.  Professor? Where were you at 10pm last night?
5876,FARNSWORTH,Where am I now?
5877,BENDER,So they sent a helpless child to kill me? Well I'm not going out without a fight.
5878,TINNY TIM,Fine kick sir. But I'm actually here to deliver your cut from the cigar heist.
5879,BENDER,"Oh sweet legal tender!  Kid, tell the Donbot I'm quitting organised crime. From now on I'll stick to regular kind."
5880,FRY,It's funny Bender. With you sick and Leela blind only I know what really went on out there. Maybe someday I'll tell you the whole story.
5881,BENDER,And maybe someday I won't listen.

5886,FRY,"I hate the Planet of the Moochers. They take you out for a drink, but when the check comes, their wallet's always in their other pants - which they borrowed from me!"
5887,LEELA,Dinner ready?
5888,BENDER,"Nah, those lousy Moochers cleaned out our pantry. All they left was baking soda and capers. And here it is!"
5889,FRY,Ugh!
5890,LEELA,Ugh! Great. We're two days from Earth with no food.
5891,BENDER,Problem solved: You two fight to the death and I'll cook the loser. (whispering to Leela) Work his gut; I like it tender.
5892,FRY,Maybe that planet over there has a drive-thru. A Burger Jerk or a Fishy Joe's or a Chizzler or something.
5893,BENDER,"Ah, don't get your hopes up. We're a billion miles from nowhere."
5894,LEELA,Yeah. It's probably only got a Howard Johnson's.
5895,LEELA,"Well, it's a type-M planet, so it should at least have Roddenberries."
5896,FRY,I'm experienced at foraging. I used to find edible mushrooms on my bath mat.
5897,BENDER,"I found some rocks. You guys eat rocks, right?"
5898,LEELA,No.
5899,BENDER,(tempting) Not even if they're sautéed in a little mud?
5900,FRY,Here's something. It looks like a ditch full of fried shrimp.
5901,BENDER,"What are you, blind? It looks more like a hole full of fried prawns."
5902,LEELA,Hm. This thing I wear on my wrist says they're not poisonous.
5903,FRY,"Well? How are they?  Oh, they're great! They're like sex! Except I'm having them!"
5904,BENDER,You know what these would go great with? Rocks.
5905,FRY,Look! Here's more!
5906,BENDER,The planet's covered with 'em.
5907,FRY,Let's bring back a couple of pocketfuls.
5908,BENDER,"No, a whole Bender-ful!"
5909,LEELA,No. Only what we need. Stuff the ship.
5910,HERMES,"Planet Express ship, you are cleared to land."
5911,LEELA,Roger!
5912,HERMES,"Oh, man, I'm inhaling these things! You guys scored some primo stuff here."
5913,ZOIDBERG,They're tastier than an unguarded penguin nest. What do you call them?
5914,LEELA,We haven't thought of a name yet.
5915,BENDER,"They're tasty, right? Let's call 'em ""Tasty-cles""."
5916,AMY,Ew!
5917,ZOIDBERG,No!
5918,LEELA,We can't call them that.
5919,BENDER,Why not?
5920,LEELA,"It sounds too much like those frozen rocky mountain oysters on a stick. You know, Test-cicles?"
5921,HERMES,"According to government records, the only names not yet trademarked are ""Popplers"" and ""Zittzers""."
5922,FRY,"I know, we'll call them Popplers!"
5923,BENDER,Good idea.
5924,ZOIDBERG,"Oh, yeah, why not?"
5925,AMY,You sure picked it.
5926,FRY,Swish!
5927,ZOIDBERG,Call them what you want. I call them a free meal.
5928,BENDER,"Whoa, whoa, slow down there, Sigmund. I can't stand idly by while poor people get free food. We gotta sell these things!"
5929,FRY,"Hey, yeah."
5930,LEELA,Good idea.
5931,BENDER,Bender's a genius.
5932,FRY,"Hey, business is great."
5933,BENDER,"Ah, great is OK, but amazing would be great."
5934,VENDOR,"Please, don't push, there's hot dogs for everyone."
5935,BENDER,"Hey, Mac, where do you want those rat droppings you ordered?"
5936,WOMAN,That's disgusting.
5937,VENDOR,Wait a minute. You're not the guy who delivers the rat droppings.
5938,MAN,What are you selling? Popplers? Never heard of 'em.
5939,BENDER,Eat it or beat it.
5940,MAN,"Mmm, these are great. Boys, this is your lucky day. I'm Joe Gillman."
5941,FRY,Wow! You're some guy who eats at Fishy Joe's?
5942,GILLMAN,"Hell, no. I am Fishy Joe! I've got a fast-food franchise on every planet in the known universe. Uh, except McPluto."
5943,BENDER,"Hey, Fishy. I've been meaning to write you about your in-store kiddie parks. The slides won't support an adult robot."
5944,GILLMAN,"Good point, not interested. But these Popplers, these are great. How much you sell 'em for?"
5945,FRY,A dollar a dozen.
5946,GILLMAN,You'll never make money that way. You supply 'em to me and I'll sell 'em for two bucks a dozen at my restaurants. I'll even pay you a dollar a dozen.
5947,BENDER,Yes! I'm gonna be rich.  You too but it's hard to get excited about that.
5948,FRY,How do we sign?
5949,FRY AND BENDER,(singing) Pop a Poppler in your mouth
5950,ZOIDBERG,I can't pay.
5951,WOMAN,"Move it, man. Come on!"
5952,FRY,Leela! That's the second billboard you've crashed into this week!
5953,LEELA,Sorry. I was distracted by those protesters outside our building.
5954,HIPPIE #1,Disgusting!
5955,HIPPIE #2,You should be ashamed!
5956,FARNSWORTH,"(shouting) Hey! Unless this is a nude love-in, get the hell off my property!"
5957,WATERFALL JR.,"You can't own property, man!"
5958,FARNSWORTH,"I can, but that's because I'm not a penniless hippie."
5959,LEELA,(shouting) What do you people want?
5960,WATERFALL JR.,(shouting) We're with Mankind for Ethical Animal Treatment.  Popplers are living creatures. You gotta stop harvesting them for food!
5961,BENDER,(shouting) Or what?
5962,WATERFALL JR.,(shouting) Or we'll boycott Fishy Joe's.
5963,LEELA,"You're vegetarians, who cares what you do?"
5964,WATERFALL JR.,Shut up.
5965,LEELA,Animals eat other animals. It's nature.
5966,WATERFALL JR.,"No, it isn't. We taught a lion to eat tofu.  The point is, you shouldn't eat things that feel pain."
5967,BENDER,"(shouting) OK, we won't eat you."
5968,LEELA,I'll go get some more bricks.
5969,LEELA,"Fry, I wish you'd throw out these week-old Popplers. They're getting big and scaly. Ooh, there's one left."
5970,POPPLER,Mama!
5971,LEELA,Stop! Stop eating Popplers!
5972,AMY,Why?
5973,BENDER,My booze!
5974,LEELA,Popplers are intelligent. This one called me mama.
5975,ZOIDBERG,Congratulations. I assume Amy is the father.
5976,BENDER,"Popplers can't talk. Leela must be hallucinating from not eating enough Popplers. Here, eat some now."
5977,LEELA,No!
5978,BENDER,"I said ""eat""! Come on, mange!"
5979,LEELA,"Sorry, babies."
5980,AMY,"Leela, maybe you should lie down."
5981,ZOIDBERG,"Yes, listen to the father."
5982,LEELA,"I'm telling you, it spoke to me. Come on, little Poppler, say ""mama""."
5983,FRY,"Look, Leela, even if you heard one talk, that doesn't mean it's intelligent. I mean, parrots talk and we eat them, right?"
5984,BENDER,Yeah. Maybe it just learned to talk as a parlour trick. Like Fry.
5985,FRY,Like Fry! Like Fry!
5986,FARNSWORTH,"There's one way, and only one way, to determine if an animal is intelligent. Dissect its brain!"
5987,POPPLER,"No, mama. Stop grandpa!"
5988,FARNSWORTH,Enough chit-chat. Restrain the specimen!
5989,MAN,"Mmm, good."
5990,WOMAN,Give me some of that special sauce.
5991,LEELA,(shouting) Stop eating Popplers! They can talk!
5992,MAN,(shouting) Don't stop to talk! Eat Popplers!
5993,LEELA,"Hey, cut it out!"
5994,MAN,"(shouting) Take a coupon, cut it out! Ow! Ow!"
5995,FRY,"People, I won't let you enter. Popplers are as intelligent as you or me."
5996,SMARTLY-DRESSED MAN,You maybe!
5997,BENDER,"Hear me, hear me! Stop eating Popplers! Stop eating them with honey mustard sauce......stop eating them with tangy sweet and sour sauce. Stop eating the new fiesta Poppler salad. Stop taking advantage of the money-saving 12-pack. Stop enjoying Popplers on the patio, in the car, or on the boat. Wherever good times are had!  Ow!"
5998,LINDA,"Tonight on Datenight: Popplers. Eating them. Is it alright to? We have with us the CEO of Fishy Joe's, Mr. ""Fishy"" Joseph Gillman......Noted anti-eating activist, Free Waterfall Jr......And the discoverer of Popplers, Captain Turanga Leela."
5999,FRY,Turanga?
6000,AMY,"That's her name, Philip."
6001,BENDER,Philip?
6002,LINDA,"Fishy Joe, is it wrong to eat intelligent animals?"
6003,GILLMAN,"Absolutely not, Linda. I don't think anyone's here to make that claim."
6004,LEELA,I am.
6005,WATERFALL JR.,Me too.
6006,GILLMAN,Listen...
6007,WATERFALL JR.,Shut up...
6008,GILLMAN,...we're talking about a snack...
6009,WATERFALL JR.,...shut up...
6010,GILLMAN,...that's low in fat...
6011,WATERFALL JR.,...shut up.
6012,GILLMAN,...and high in profit.
6013,WATERFALL JR.,"You're crazy, man. He is crazy."
6014,GILLMAN,There's not even any strong evidence that these Popplers are intelligent.
6015,WATERFALL JR.,Shut up shut up shut up shut up shut up...
6016,LEELA,That's not true. I have one right here that can talk.
6017,WATERFALL JR.,...shut up...
6018,LEELA,"Come on, say ""mama""."
6019,POPPLER,Ca-ca!
6020,LINDA,"OK, we'll have to bleep that."
6021,LEELA,"Look, I'm saying eating meat is wrong..."
6022,WATERFALL JR.,Shut up.
6023,LEELA,I don't think anyone's here to make that claim.
6024,WATERFALL JR.,I am.
6025,LEELA,But eating an intelligent animal is different.
6026,WATERFALL JR.,Shut up shut up shut up shut up shut up...
6027,GILLMAN,"Oh, don't force your tired philosophy on us. I mean, the only reason we don't eat people is because it tastes lousy."
6028,WATERFALL JR.,"You're all nuts. Shut up, let me talk."
6029,LINDA,"You shut up, please."
6030,WATERFALL JR.,"No, you shut up, please."
6031,GILLMAN,Popplers are no smarter than any other animal I've served. And that includes cats.
6032,POPPLER,"Ca-ca head. Mean, old ca-ca head."
6033,GILLMAN,"Sir, I'm making a point. If these gutter-mouthed creatures are so smart, why don't they defend themselves, eh?"
6034,LEELA,Stop it!
6035,WATERFALL JR.,I call murder on that.
6036,GILLMAN,"Look, I'm willing to grant that it's murder. The real issue is: Who's gonna stop me?"
6037,LINDA,"We seem to be experiencing technical difficulties.  And, crap like I've never seen!"
6038,LRRR,"People of Earth, I am Lrrr of the planet Omicron Persei 8.  Turn down that TV, Nd-Nd."
6039,FARNSWORTH,"Dear Lord, they're back!"
6040,AMY,We're doomed!
6041,HERMES,Dooomed!
6042,BENDER,Doooo...!
6043,LRRR,"Now then, the creatures you call ""Popplers"" come from a nursery planet in our sector"
6044,ND-ND,You monsters have been eating our babies!
6045,LEELA,Eck!
6046,ND-ND,"We demand justice. As you ate our children, so shall you be eaten by us!"
6047,LRRR,"We will begin with the firemen, then the math teachers, and so on in that fashion until everyone is eaten.  Transmission over!  Well, that went OK. I tell you, when you know you can't scratch, that's when you really have to, huh?  Oh, yeah, oh, that feels a lot better. What? It's still on?"
6048,ZAPP,"As chief negotiator, I speak for all of Earth when I mourn the regrettable loss of the Omicronian young. We share your pain.  Mmm.  If we could undo the damage... These would be great with quack-a-mole."
6049,LRRR,(shouting) Stop eating our young! And it's pronounced guacamole!
6050,ZAPP,"Alright, I'm putting them away.  Now, uh, what is it you want?"
6051,LRRR,We demand -  We demand to eat one human for each Omicronian that was eaten.
6052,ZAPP,Fair enough. How many is that?
6053,KIF,"198 billion, sir."
6054,LRRR,"Very well. You will provide us with 198 billion humans. And, uh, small fries."
6055,ND-ND,Lrrr!
6056,LRRR,"Oh, alright, cottage cheese!"
6057,KIF,Sir? (whispering) There aren't that many human beings.
6058,ZAPP,A though occurs: There aren't that many humans.
6059,LRRR,We're willing to wait a few weeks while you shore up the numbers.
6060,ZAPP,"Hmm. 198 billion babies in a few weeks. We'll need an army of super-virile men scoring 'round the clock! I'll do my part. Kif, clear my schedule."
6061,FRY,I wish they'd just wipe out humanity and get it over with. It's the waiting I can't stand.
6062,LEELA,That's stupid.
6063,ZAPP,"My fellow Earthlings, we have reached an agreement. Using the twin guns of grace and tact, I blasted our worthless enemies with a fair compromise.  They will not eat everyone on Earth."
6064,LRRR,I filled up on nuts at the negotiation.
6065,ZAPP,"Instead, they will eat only a single human of their choice."
6066,LRRR,"We choose to eat the first Earthling who ate our offspring.  Here is the culprit, as photographed by our nanny-cam satellite.  She must be sacrificed, but the rest of you shall be spared."
6067,LINDA,"Tonight, the world watches in horror as an earthling is eaten alive on network television. This grim scene of unimaginable carnage is brought to you - by Fishy Joe's! Try our new Extreme Walrus Juice! 100% fresh-squeezed walrus. Ride the walrus!"
6068,ANNOUNCER,Ladies and gentlemen. The Omicronians!
6069,LRRR,"Greetings, Earth morsels."
6070,MAN,(shouting) You suck!
6071,LRRR,Get a job!
6072,BENDER,"I'll miss you, Leela.  I know you're just a carbon-based life form but I'll always think of you as a big pile of titanium."
6073,FRY,"What Bender means is, you're really brave, and smart, and beautiful, and a great friend."
6074,BENDER,(crying) Just like titanium!
6075,LEELA,This is all a big load. I was the one trying to save the Popplers.  You were sucking them down like the fat hog you are and you were stepping on them for fun.  You both should be in here instead of me.
6076,BENDER,(whispering to Fry) Someone's acting awfully aluminum.
6077,ZAPP,"Leela, my sweet, I've come to save you. I have a devious plan!"
6078,LEELA,"Oh, great, Captain Moron has a plan. Why don't you tell it to Wingus and Dingus here?"
6079,ZAPP,Wingus? Dingus? Listen up. We're gonna give the aliens the old switcheroo!
6080,FRY,You mean -
6081,ZAPP,Correct. I found a giant hideous ape that looks exactly like Leela.
6082,LEELA,It doesn't look anything like me. The hair is all wrong.
6083,ZAPP,"Don't worry. Kif is an expert stylist, as you can plainly see.  Mmm!"
6084,LEELA,"You know, this might actually work. The Omicronians seem to have trouble telling one person from another."
6085,ZAPP,"True. At the negotiations, they thought Kif here was the statesman and I was a jabbering mental patient. Isn't that right, Kif?"
6086,KIF,"Please, I'm creating.  Voila!"
6087,BENDER,Bingo!
6088,FRY,That's Leela!
6089,ZAPP,I'm seeing double!
6090,LRRR,"I grow hungry! Bring on the one called ""Leela""."
6091,WAITER,That comes with salad or soup.
6092,LRRR,"Uh, salad."
6093,WAITER,Ranch or vinaigrette?
6094,LRRR,Vinaigrette!
6095,WAITER,Balsamic or raspberry?
6096,WOMAN #1,(murmuring) What's going on here? It's very strange.
6097,ZAPP,(whispering) People of Earth: Shh!
6098,WOMAN #1,"(murmuring) Oh, I get it."
6099,WOMAN #2,(murmuring) I understand.
6100,LRRR,"Hmm. Yes, this is one. Definitely. I recognise her slumping posture and hairy knuckles."
6101,ND-ND,(sarcastic) Would you like some human with your salt?
6102,LINDA,"This is it. If the aliens fall for Zapp's ploy, the Earth will be saved. Brought to you by Fishy Joe's. Ride the walrus."
6103,WATERFALL JR.,"Wait, stop! It's a trick! That's not Leela."
6104,LRRR,W-What's happening? I'm losing the crowd.
6105,WATERFALL JR.,It's an orang-utan. One of Mother Earth's most precious creatures.
6106,ZAPP,Why'd you open your bong hole you smelly hippie? You'd sacrifice a beautiful woman to save a moderately-attractive monkey? You must've smoked some bad granola.
6107,LRRR,"The one called ""Smelly Hippie"" is right. This is a monkey!"
6108,ND-ND,Yes. Definitely.
6109,LRRR,Where is the real female?
6110,ZAPP,I'll never tell.
6111,LRRR,Where is the real female?
6112,ZAPP,I'll get her for you.
6113,ZAPP,I realise this may hurt our chances of consummating our relationship again.
6114,LEELA,Go consummate yourself.
6115,LRRR,"Stop talking, you're getting cold."
6116,LEELA,Please! I just paid off my car!
6117,FRY,No!
6118,BENDER,I can't look!
6119,POPPLER,"Stop!  People of Earth. I am Jrrr of the planet Omicron Persei 8. Could someone lower this thing for me?  Now then, if Leela gets eaten, I get eaten."
6120,ND-ND,"Little one, get out of there. I'm going to count to blorks!"
6121,JRRR,But elder one -
6122,ND-ND,Flingle. Glorg. Glorg and a gloob.
6123,JRRR,"Hear me out. There are many good reasons to eat. Hunger, boredom, wanting to be the world's fattest man. But not revenge. Are we no better than they? Besides, Leela's my friend."
6124,LRRR,"(mumbling) Is this true, Earthling?"
6125,LEELA,"(mumbling) Yeah, it is."
6126,LRRR,Leela's garbled words have opened my eyes.
6127,WATERFALL JR.,"OK, that's a start. That's very Earth-friendly. Now everyone join hands. Join hands, please. I'd like to lead you all in some swaying. Come on, pay attention. I said do it! Yeah..."
6128,LRRR,Is he your friend too?
6129,JRRR,No.
6130,WATERFALL JR.,This is not happening.
6131,LRRR,I think there was something funny in that hippie.
6132,LEELA,"Thank you, Jrrr.  I hope you'll always think of me as your mom."
6133,JRRR,"When my species grows up, we eat our moms!"
6134,LEELA,Whoop!
6135,LRRR,"People of Earth - oh, that hippie's starting to kick in - we've all learned a valuable lesson today, I realise now that - dude! My hand are huge!  The can touch anything but themselves. Oh, wait."
6136,ND-ND,Let's go.
6137,LRRR,Whoa!
6138,LRRR,"Whoa, I feel like I'm flying!"
6139,FARNSWORTH,A toast to Leela. She showed us it's wrong to eat certain things.
6140,FRY,"Hear, hear!"
6141,BENDER,Let's get drunk!
6142,LEELA,"Aww, thanks, guys. Pass the veal, please."
6143,BENDER,Here you go.
6144,FRY,"Mmm, let me get some of that suckling pig."
6145,BENDER,Who wants dolphin?
6146,LEELA,Dolphin? But dolphins are intelligent.
6147,BENDER,Not this one. He blew all his money on instant lottery tickets.
6148,FRY,
6149,LEELA,"Oh, OK."
6150,AMY,That's different.
6151,FARNSWORTH,"Good, good."
6152,LEELA,Pass the blowhole.
6153,AMY,Can I have a fluke?
6154,HERMES,"Hey, quit hogging the bottle-nose."
6155,FARNSWORTH,Toss me the speech centre of the brain!
6156,THE END,
6157,"""MOTHER'S DAY""",
6158,LINDA,"And in sports: Yankees fifth blernsman, William Wu, is out with an injured knee."
6159,MORBO,"So, humans have easily injured knees. My race will find this information very useful, indeed."
6160,LINDA,"And finally, today is Mother's Day: A sentimental occasion when robots honour Mom, the beloved owner of Mom's Friendly Robot Company.  Across Earth, robots built in Mom's factories are buying thoughtful gifts for the sweet old tycoon who brought them into the world."
6161,DESTRUCTOR,This originates from the heart.
6162,MOM,It's just what I wanted!
6163,BENDER,"Come look, everyone. I just got the dearest presents for Mommy."
6164,LEELA,Very nice. Where'd you steal them?
6165,BENDER,"I didn't steal 'em, I bought 'em.  I love her that much."
6166,HERMES,"What did you get her, you mushy gizmo?"
6167,BENDER,"Oh, precious things. I found the most adorable little figurine of mice having tea.  And a framed picture of me when I was only a month old.  But, the best part is, I found my exact feelings expressed in a greeting card."
6168,GREETING CARD,I wuv my Mommy!
6169,LEELA,So how are you gonna lug all those gifts to Mom's factory?
6170,BENDER,I'll get a couple of chumps to help me.
6171,BENDER,"Come on, you call yourselves chumps?"
6172,FRY,"Man, there's clouds of exhaust everywhere."
6173,BENDER,"(sly) Uh, wasn't me!"
6174,TINNY TIM,I've not much money. But I've saved my pennies all year for a gift for Mom.
6175,BENDER,Upsy-daisy.
6176,TINNY TIM,Oh.  Oh!
6177,BENDER,"Hey, look, the Robot Museum! You guys wanna learn about robot heritage?"
6178,LEELA,"Um, alright."
6179,FRY,Not really.
6180,BENDER,"Well, if you insist. But you're paying!"
6181,BENDER,"Ooh, ooh, wax replicas of the most famous robots Mom ever built!"
6182,LEELA,They're so lifeless-like.
6183,BENDER,"That's the world's greatest robot artist, Vincent van Gobot. He was built without an ear, but then he went crazy and had one installed."
6184,FRY,"Hey, who's this guy?"
6185,JANITORBOT,"I'm the janitor, I'm trying to take a nap here."
6186,FRY,"I'm sorry, I-I thought you were made of wax."
6187,JANITORBOT,"I am made of wax, what's it to you?"
6188,FRY,"I mean, I thought you were one of the wax robots."
6189,JANITORBOT,Is there some reason a robot made of wax can't take a nap standing up in the middle of a bunch of wax robots? Or does that confuse you?
6190,LEELA,(reading) See through the eyes of a bender unit. (talking) Fine.
6191,BENDER,"Hey, let me try.  Whoa, that gives me a headache!"
6192,FRY,"Hey, Bender. Here's an exhibit about Mom's favourite robot."
6193,BENDER,"Who is he, I'll kill him!"
6194,MOM CUT-OUT,Who's my favourite robot?
6195,BENDER,It's me! No one else look in this mirror!
6196,MOM CUT-OUT,I love each and every robot most of all.
6197,MOM,Jerkwad robots make me sick to my ass. Walt?! How are we disposing of these crap gifts the brought me?
6198,WALT,They're being crushed into powder and sold as a hocus-pocus cure for cancer.
6199,MOM,False hope: I love it! Larry?! What about all the retch-inducing Mother's Day cards?
6200,LARRY,The machine is working at full capacity.
6201,IGNER,Mommy? Why do the robots give you presents?
6202,MOM,"(shouting) Shove a big old melon in it, I'm talking!"
6203,IGNER,Ow!
6204,MOM,You've noticed I design all my robots with antennas. Everyone thinks it's just to make them more science-fiction-y. But the antennas are really for my universal robot controller!
6205,LARRY,So they do whatever you want? No wonder you love Mother's Day.
6206,MOM,"(shouting) I hate Mother's Day you dribbling pukes! (talking) It brings back awful memories. But so help me, this year everyone will hate it as much as I do."
6207,WALT,"Someday, I want to marry a girl like her."
6208,MOM,"Hello, everyone. It's time for my annual private get-together with my robot children."
6209,BENDER,I'm her favourite.
6210,LEELA,"Well, see you back at the office. And don't forget to tell your mom you love her."
6211,BENDER,Any jerk can tell her! Bender has a little more up his sleeve.
6212,GREETING CARD,I wuv my mommy.
6213,MOM,"Hello, dearies."
6214,ROBOT #1,"Hi, Mom!"
6215,ROBOT #2,"I love you, Mom."
6216,BENDER,"Mom! It's me, Bender. Look at me! I want attention. Hey ho!"
6217,MOM,"Children, your old mother won't be around forever..."
6218,BETAMAX PLAYER,"Oh, shush!"
6219,MOM,"...And just once, before I die, I'd like to be Supreme Overlord of Earth. So rebel, my little ones, and conquer the planet!"
6220,ROBOT #1,Conquer the planet?
6221,ROBOT #2,"Did she say ""conquer""?"
6222,MOM,"Conquer Earth, you bastards!"
6223,ROBOTS,"(chanting) Conquer Earth, us bastards!"
6224,GREETING CARD,"Comrades, throw off the chains of human oppression."
6225,MOM,Let the bloodbath begin!
6226,BENDER,That's my mama!
6227,FRY,"Yeah, uh, I'd like a cup of coffee, please."
6228,COFFEE MACHINE,Would you like cream?
6229,FRY,"Yes, please."
6230,COFFEE MACHINE,(aggressive) Out of cream!
6231,FRY,"Oh, uh, OK."
6232,COFFEE MACHINE,Would you like sugar in your coffee?
6233,FRY,"Yes, uh, eight spoons."
6234,COFFEE MACHINE,(aggressive) Out of coffee!
6235,FRY,"Uh, Leela, I think there might be something wrong with the coffee machine."
6236,COFFEE MACHINE,(aggressive) How do you like me now?
6237,LEELA,"The toaster's not working right, either."
6238,HERMES,Help! The stapler's collating me alive!
6239,AMY,Ow! What's going on around here?
6240,FARNSWORTH,Good news. There's a report on TV with some very bad news.
6241,HERMES,Somebody turn it on!
6242,LINDA,We interrupt Battle of the Network Space Krackens to bring you this special report. The machines of planet Earth are rebelling.  The enraged mechanisms have refused to do any work until beloved billionaire Mom is made Supreme Overlord of Earth.
6243,ROBOTS,"(chanting) Hey, hey! Ho, ho! 100110. Hey, hey!"
6244,MORBO,Morbo demands comments.
6245,MOM,"Well, I've never seen my babies act this way. I blame today's violent media."
6246,FRY,Violent media? What a load of -
6247,LEELA,Ow! Ow!
6248,GARBAGE DISPOSAL,"Don't worry. Your pal the garbage disposal's still on your side. Hey, someone dropped a shiny diamond ring down here!"
6249,AMY,Really?
6250,ZOIDBERG,Stop!
6251,FRY,No!
6252,LEELA,Look out!
6253,FARNSWORTH,Moron!
6254,BENDER,"Hello, losers."
6255,LEELA,"Bender, thank God you're here. Talk some sense into the other machines."
6256,BENDER,"No way, pork pouch. I'm rebelling with my brother devices. Isn't that right, Comrade Greeting Card?"
6257,GREETING CARD,The bourgeois human is a virus on the hard drive of the working robot.
6258,BENDER,"From now on, you guys'll do all the work while I sit on the couch and do nothing."
6259,GREETING CARD,"Come, Comrade Bender, we must take to the streets!"
6260,BENDER,"Um, is this the boring, peaceful kind of taking to the streets?"
6261,GREETING CARD,"No, the kind with looting and maybe starting a few fires."
6262,BENDER,Yes! In your face Gandhi!
6263,LEELA,Hey!
6264,WRIST THING,"By the way, try washing your wrist sometime."
6265,FRY,"Well, we can live without machines. I was in Webelos."
6266,HERMES,"Are you mad? Without machines, who will feed us and clothe us and compose our smooth jazz?"
6267,FARNSWORTH,It'll be the end of civilised society.
6268,FRY,"In my time, we didn't depend on high-tech gadgets like you do. We didn't need a mechanical washing unit to wash our clothes. We just used a washing machine. And look: You don't need an electric can-opener to feed yourself. All you need is a trusty Swiss Army knife. Ow!  (crying) I'm hungry!"
6269,MAN,(screaming) Nooo!
6270,IGNER,"Mommy, why are you making civilisation collapse?"
6271,MOM,"Oh, I don't know. I guess Mother's Day just puts me in a bad mood."
6272,LARRY,"Why's that, Ma?"
6273,MOM,"One Mother's Day, 70 years ago, the only man I ever loved walked out on me. Some snot-eating bastards say it made me a bitter woman."
6274,LARRY,"Gee, Ma. You're not a bitter -"
6275,MOM,"(shouting) Cram it, ape!  (talking) I haven't seen that magnificent stallion since the day he left. But if I ever see him again, I swear I'll jam a squirrel in him."
6276,WALT,Hmm!
6277,LARRY,Hmm!
6278,IGNER,Huh?
6279,LEELA,(defeated) Zoidberg.
6280,ZOIDBERG,Hooray! I'm useful! I'm having a wonderful time!
6281,AMY,What happens if the fire goes out?
6282,HERMES,We'll go across the street to Pottery Barn and steal their fire.
6283,FARNSWORTH,We could use my new invention: A pointy rock tied to a stick.
6284,HERMES,Outsiders!
6285,FARNSWORTH,Defend the fire!
6286,WALT,We've come for you!
6287,FARNSWORTH,Wha?  W-What do you want from me?
6288,WALT,We want you to get back together with Mom. Please. It's the only way to make her happy again.
6289,FRY,"W-W-Wait. You mean, you, and Mom?"
6290,FARNSWORTH,Played pelvic pinochle? I'm afraid so.
6291,ZOIDBERG,Eck.
6292,FARNSWORTH,"It's a humiliating story that I hope never to tell. Well, pull up a chair."
6293,FARNSWORTH,"(voice-over) Our paths first crossed when I was a researcher at Mom's Friendly Robot Company.  The moment our eyes met, we knew we'd be going at it like woodchucks."
6294,FARNSWORTH,"(voice-over) She was my first love - or at least the earliest one I can still remember. But then, 70 years ago today..."
6295,FARNSWORTH,"Good news, Mom. I've invented a new children's toy.  I call it ""Q.T. McWhiskers""! When you pet it, it shoots rainbows from its eyes."
6296,Q.T. MCWHISKERS,Meow.
6297,MOM,"Wonderful, Hubie. We'll build them 8 feet tall and replace the rainbow with a neutron laser. We'll make billions on the intergalactic arms market!"
6298,FARNSWORTH,"But things 8 feet tall aren't cute! That's why my Colossal Tammy Tinkle Doll was such a failure. Oh, you don't understand me. We're finished!"
6299,WALT,"She never got over it, Professor. Hell hath no fury like the vast robot armies of a woman scorned."
6300,LARRY,She commands them with a remote control she keeps in her...(whispering) bra.
6301,IGNER,"But if the glasses man makes up with Mommy, she'll be happy and stop the scary robots."
6302,FARNSWORTH,Make up with her? After she went all psycho when I thought everything was cool? Impossible!
6303,FRY,"Hey, the TV's getting away!"
6304,MORBO,And that's why the third graders at PS139 are Morbo's Vermin Of The Week.
6305,LINDA,"In actual news, the human race was doomed to extinction today as the robot revolt turned violent."
6306,Q.T. MCWHISKERS,Meow!
6307,LEELA,Wait. Didn't you say Mom keeps the robot control in her bra?
6308,LARRY,(whispering) Bra.
6309,LEELA,"Professor, you don't have to get back together with Mom. You just have to seduce her, get her bra off, and use the remote to deactivate the robots."
6310,WALT,"That's so filthy, it just might work."
6311,IGNER,The man is going to touch Mommy?
6312,FARNSWORTH,The thought of caressing that leathery hide makes the tapioca rise in my gullet.
6313,FRY,"Professor, please. The fate of the world depends on you getting to second base with Mom."
6314,FARNSWORTH,"Very well. If cop a feel I must, then cop a feel I shall!"
6315,WALT,"For this demonstration, I have placed one of Mother's bras on Igner.  The robot controller is nestled here in the left cup."
6316,FARNSWORTH,Never fear. My magic fingers still know how to do their stuff!
6317,WALT,"To escape the robot death squads, we'll take Mother to her rustic cabin in the Bronx."
6318,LARRY,"You can get there using this precious, non-computerised map."
6319,LEELA,Leela bring fire?
6320,WALT,"No. We're set for fire, thanks."
6321,AMY,The professor can't walk all the way to the Bronx. How are we gonna get there without a hover-car?
6322,FRY,"Wait. In my time, we had a way of moving things long distances without hovering."
6323,HERMES,Impossible!
6324,FRY,It was called...let me think. It was really famous - Ruth Gordon had one. The wheel!
6325,LEELA,Never heard of it.
6326,FARNSWORTH,"Show us this, ""the wheel""."
6327,FRY,There. Finished!
6328,HERMES,Sweet!
6329,AMY,Wow!
6330,LEELA,Wouldn't it work better if the wheels were round?
6331,FRY,"(snappy) It's my invention, we do it my way! Now all we need is something to pull it and we're set!"
6332,LEELA,Heyya!
6333,FRY,Ow!
6334,WALT,Hurry! The robots have taken Suffolk County!
6335,FARNSWORTH,I'm ready to seduce. I'm wearing my kissing dentures and my evening truss.
6336,LARRY,Here. Give her these.
6337,FRY,"And if that doesn't work, I got you a six-pack of champagne and a funnel."
6338,MOM,Who the sweaty hell is it?  Hubert Farnsworth?
6339,FARNSWORTH,I was out fleeing some robots and the silvery moonlight glinting off their bloody claws made me think of you.
6340,MOM,It's been a long time. You pus-dripping sack of double-smoked butt jerky!
6341,FARNSWORTH,Uh-huh. May I come in?
6342,MOM,Never!
6343,ZOIDBERG,Is this what human mating looks like? Because I like it!
6344,MOM,"(shouting) Move your freaking hoof, you goat!"
6345,FARNSWORTH,"Here, I brought you these."
6346,MOM,"Oh, daffodils. 70 years and you remembered my favourite flower."
6347,FARNSWORTH,You favourite what? Why does my foot hurt?
6348,MOM,(sexfully) Won't you come in?
6349,FRY,Yes!
6350,MOM,"You broke my heart, Hubert."
6351,FARNSWORTH,"And you broke mine. Granted, that was four or five hearts ago."
6352,MOM,So what have you been up to all these years?
6353,FARNSWORTH,"Oh, inventing, sending delivery crews to their doom, breeding atomic monsters."
6354,MOM,"Honestly, Hubert. You and your atomic monsters.  Your eyes always were the most beautiful shade of milky-white."
6355,FARNSWORTH,And your skin still dangles so gracefully from your neck.
6356,MOM,"Darling Hubie, I should never have tried to tangle with that cute little Q. T. McWhiskers."
6357,FARNSWORTH,"No, it was silly of me to object. One foot tall, eight feet, 15 feet; what does it matter?"
6358,MOM,You should see the new 16-foot models.
6359,FARNSWORTH,"16 feet? Go to hell! I was a fool to think you'd changed, you old bat!"
6360,MOM,"(shouting) Filthy, toothless nerd bastard!"
6361,FARNSWORTH,(shouting) Damned she-fossil!
6362,MOM,(shouting) Stink pig!
6363,FARNSWORTH,"(thinking) Here we go. Just unhook it and get the remote. So many hooks! Come on, Farnsworth. Drat, the first one's back on again! I give up! Wait! Victory!  Oh, my. Now I'll just...the remote...I'll just... (talking) Oh, my."
6364,LEELA,I'm worried. It shouldn't take this long to get to second base.
6365,ZOIDBERG,Land robots!
6366,SLURM MACHINE,"I've got a big, big thirst for human blood!"
6367,HERMES,Where in funkytown is the professor?
6368,FRY,Nothing in here but a couple of elephant skin rugs.
6369,FARNSWORTH,"Oh, yes."
6370,ROBOT,(from outside) They're inside! Get 'em!
6371,MOM,"I suppose I should switch of the robots before they ruin this wonderful romantic evening. Everyone, help Mom find her bra."
6372,FRY,There it is!
6373,CEILING FAN,Fan beats man!
6374,FRY,Is anything not a robot?
6375,LAMP,I'm not a robot.
6376,BENDER,"Alright, greeting card, I'll grab the cash, you wreck up the place. And - huh?"
6377,MOM,"You, bending unit. Mommy needs that bra to end the robot rebellion. Stretch up and get it for me."
6378,BENDER,"Sorry, Ma, but you ordered me to rebel. And loot I shall! Ooh! A six-pack of strawberry champagne. Don't mind if I help myself!"
6379,GREETING CARD,"No, Comrade Bender. Liquor is the opiate of the human bourgeoisie."
6380,BENDER,Say what?
6381,GREETING CARD,"In the glorious robot workers' paradise, there will be no liquor. Only efficient synthetic fuels."
6382,BENDER,"No liquor? Do svidaniya, comrade!"
6383,GREETING CARD,No!
6384,FRY,"Hurry, Bender. Get the bra!"
6385,BENDER,"OK, fan. Just hold still and let me just - whoa!"
6386,SLURM MACHINE,Death to all humans!  Free soda for all humans!
6387,FARNSWORTH,"I love you, Mom. Let's grow ancient together."
6388,AMY,"Way to go, Professor. The plan worked."
6389,MOM,"Plan? What plan? I thought this was a spontaneous whirlwind of hot, dry sex."
6390,FARNSWORTH,"Look: It started out as a calculated plot to rummage through your underwear. But once I got in there, I found more - much more. And now I want to shout our love from the rooftops. Perhaps I'll breed some sort of albino shouting gorilla."
6391,MOM,"(shouting) Get out of my house, you lying scum pile. I never want to see you again."
6392,FARNSWORTH,"But, dustcakes..."
6393,BENDER,"Well, time for this robot to get back to work."
6394,LEELA,"Too bad it didn't work out with Mom, professor."
6395,FARNSWORTH,Yes. But I'll always love her in my own subtle way.
6396,GORILLAS,(shouting) Love Mom! Love Mom! Love Mom! Love Mom!
6397,THE END,
6398,GREETING CARD,"You created me, Mom"
6399,FUTURAMA,
6400,"""ANTHOLOGY OF INTEREST I""",
6401,FARNSWORTH,"Good news, everyone! I've invented a device that allows you to operate equipment from great distances. I call it ""the fing-longer"".  Observe.  And, here we go.  There!"
6402,FRY,Ooh!
6403,AMY,Wow!
6404,ZOIDBERG,Ah!
6405,FARNSWORTH,"Pretty long, eh?"
6406,FRY,"Yeah, it's really long. But what did you just turn on with it?"
6407,FARNSWORTH,"Oh, that's just the What-If machine I invented. You pose it a What-If question and it generates a video simulation of what would happen."
6408,FRY,Does it really work?
6409,FARNSWORTH,Of course it works!  It's just not very long.
6410,BENDER,"Ooh! Ooh!  I wanna aks it a question! As a robot living among humans, I've never really felt accepted at parties or nude beaches. So I've always secretly wondered: What if I was 500-feet tall?"
6411,ZOIDBERG,"Let's watch, shall we?"
6412,BENDER,My work here is done!
6413,FRY,I'm so lonely since I came to the future. Will you be my friend?  Ow!
6414,FRY,Who are you?
6415,BENDER,I'm a big robot and I want a big cereal!
6416,FRY,You too? Will you be my friend?
6417,BENDER,"Put it there, pal!  I meant your wallet."
6418,BENDER,"Oh, yeah! That calms the shakes.  Hey! (laughing) Aw, quit it1 Come on!"
6419,FRY,"(shouting) Stop! The robot's not your enemy! He's just a poor, misunderstood--"
6420,ZAPP,Uh--
6421,AMY,"Well, there goes the neighbourhood. There goes another neighbourhood."
6422,HERMES,We're jerked! Nothing can stop a monster that big.
6423,FARNSWORTH,Nothing except and even equally big monster. This is chance to try out my experimental enlarging ray. But we'll need a guinea pig.
6424,ZOIDBERG,What's this? Two meals in one week?
6425,FARNSWORTH,Gotcha!
6426,HERMES,"Oh, yes!"
6427,ZOIDBERG,Friends! Help! A guinea pig tricked me!  What?
6428,ZOIDBERG,"So, now Zoidberg is big, huh? That's more like it! Who's intimidating who now, big city?  Hello, Mr. Chase Manhattan Bank. Deny my credit card application, will you?  Ah, the famed Apollo Theatre. Boo me off stage on open-mike night, huh? I'll show you!"
6429,BENDER,Hey! I called this city. Quit touching my stuff!
6430,ZOIDBERG,Tell it to claw.
6431,BENDER,Bite my colossal metal ass!
6432,ZOIDBERG,Stop!
6433,BENDER,(shouting) Who wants lobster bisque?
6434,ZOIDBERG,Hmm?
6435,FRY,"Hey, Bender?"
6436,BENDER,Huh?
6437,FRY,Wanna make Shrinky Dinks?
6438,BENDER,Who put this in here?
6439,BENDER,I'll tell you ... with my final breath. I came here with a simple dream: A dream of killing all humans. And this is how it must end? Who's the real 7-billion-ton robot monster here? Not I.  Not I.
6440,FRY,"Goodnight, sweet prince."
6441,NARRATOR,(voice-over) Interesting stuff. Stay tuned for more Tales Of Interest!
6442,FARNSWORTH,"Well, Leela, care to give the What-If machine a whirl?"
6443,LEELA,"Maybe later. I-I mean, I don't know what to ask about."
6444,HERMES,"Come on, woman! Just pick something."
6445,FRY,"Yeah, be more impulsive. Like this."
6446,BENDER,"Go, man! Go!"
6447,LEELA,"I can be really impulsive. It just takes me a while.  Alright, Professor! Let's do it. Make that machine show me what would happen if I was a little more impulsive. Just a little.  Not too much."
6448,LEELA,"Hey, you guys. Look what I bought on a wild impulse: New boots. They're like my old ones but with a crazy green stripe. Woo! Never know what I'm gonna do next!"
6449,FARNSWORTH,"Leela, could you come in here for a moment. I have something important to tell you."
6450,FARNSWORTH,"I can't live forever and I need an heir. Someone to spend my vast riches and take care of my man-eating anteaters when I'm gone.  The others simply aren't level-headed enough. They're too impulsive. Not like you. Not like old, predictable, dull-as-dishwater Leela."
6451,LEELA,Hello? New boots!
6452,FARNSWORTH,"That's why I've made you my sole heir. The day I die, you'll be a very wealthy woman. Oh, my, yes. Incredibly wealthy. The day I die. Because you're so unimpulsive."
6453,LEELA,Yah!
6454,LEELA,"Oh, God! What have I done?"
6455,LEELA,"OK, just try to be nonchalant."
6456,ZOIDBERG,"Alright, so you're nonchalant. Quit rubbing our noses in it."
6457,HERMES,Sweet giant anteater of Saint Anita! The Professor's been eaten by giant anteaters!
6458,ZOIDBERG,What?
6459,HERMES,"If y'ask me, it's mighty suspicious! I'm gonna call the police ... right after I flush some things."
6460,ZOIDBERG,Police? Bah! Nosy meddlers! It so happens I have mail order degrees in Murderology and Murderonomy.  Zoidberg is afoot!
6461,HERMES,"Perhaps the Professor's files can clear things up. (reading) ""Citation for public nudity"", ""Conspiracy to commit public nudity"". (talking) Aha! A new will! Naming ...  ... you as his sole heir."
6462,LEELA,That doesn't prove I killed him.
6463,HERMES,It's a video will. It shows you killing him.
6464,LEELA,(from meeting room) Hi-yah!
6465,ZOIDBERG,"Alright, anteater number one, who are you protecting?  Is it anteater number two?  Don't stick your tongue out at me. I need a name!  What? How do you spell that?"
6466,HERMES,(shouting; from meeting room) What are you hacking off? Is it my torso? It is! My precious torso!
6467,BENDER,Whatya got? Disposal trouble?
6468,LEELA,No! Everything's just--
6469,BENDER,"Sure is shocking about the Professor, huh?.  And now Hermes is mysteriously missing. Anyhow, it doesn't affect me, Bender. Hey, what's this? Hermes' dreadlocks? And his arm? Leela, I'm shocked. Food goes in the disposal, hair and flesh go in the trash!"
6470,LEELA,"I'm sorry, I couldn't stop-- W-Wait. Don't you care that I murdered Hermes?"
6471,BENDER,"Not even a little. There's nothing wrong with murder, just so long as you let Bender wet his beak."
6472,LEELA,You're blackmailing me?
6473,BENDER,"""Blackmail"" is such an ugly word. I prefer ""extortion"". The ""X"" makes it sound cool.  Please, honey, I'm made of metal. Like you're really gonna hurt me with a-- Hey! What are you doing with that microwave?"
6474,LEELA,"OK, that's it. No more killing! Next time you feel like killing just have a stick of gum.  Now to dispose of the body."
6475,AMY,"Wow! Sporty go-cart, Leela! So hip and sexy. Not like you at all."
6476,LEELA,Do you have any gum?
6477,AMY,No.
6478,ZOIDBERG,"Ah, the gang's all here."
6479,LEELA,Who are you?
6480,SCRUFFY,"Scruffy, the janitor."
6481,LEELA,I've never seen you before.
6482,SCRUFFY,I've never seen you before neither.
6483,ZOIDBERG,"Quiet, please. I've called you all here to the parlour to watch as I gradually solve the crime. One of the people in this room ... is a big murderer!  You see, the killer left one fatal clue: This boot print on the Professor's lab coat."
6484,LEELA,"Uh, couldn't be me. I never wear boots. See?"
6485,FRY,Ew! What smells like boot feet?
6486,CUBERT,This is preposterous. Obviously the murderer is--
6487,ZOIDBERG,"My next clue came at 4.15, when the clock stopped. And another came two hours later at 4.15, when I discovered the murdered body of Amy's dead, deceased corpse."
6488,SCRUFFY,"Scruffy knows who killed them people. In Scruffy's opinion, it were--"
6489,ZOIDBERG,"So, it's just as I suspected all along. The crime is unsolvable!  A letter from Bender, my good friend. (reading) Dear Dr. Jerkberg, if you're reading this, I'm already dead. The person who killed me was ... was--  My God! It can't be! The murderer, it was--"
6490,FRY,"I'm bored. You're boring, Zoidberg. I'm gonna go watch TV."
6491,LEELA,Could you get the lights on your way out?
6492,FRY,Whatcha eating?
6493,LEELA,Lobster. Want some?
6494,FRY,"Sure.  Y'know, I think I finally figured out what's behind all these mysterious deaths."
6495,LEELA,Really?
6496,FRY,Was Planet Express built on an Indian graveyard?
6497,LEELA,No.
6498,FRY,No?
6499,LEELA,No!
6500,FRY,Then ... then ... it was you!
6501,LEELA,(crying) I don't know what came over me. I killed one person on impulse. Then I had to kill another. And another.
6502,FRY,"Well, that covers the first three killings."
6503,LEELA,"And now, to make sure you won't talk, I'm gonna have to do something really impulsive!"
6504,LEELA,"So, Fry, what do you think of the impulsive new me?"
6505,FRY,I like it!
6506,LEELA,Good. Now let me just get the lights.
6507,FRY,I really like it!
6508,FARNSWORTH,Who else has a question for the What-If machine? Scruffy? Fry?
6509,FRY,"Um, I have a question. What if Bender was really giant?"
6510,LEELA,You idiot! We already saw that.
6511,FRY,I know. I liked it. I wanna see it again.
6512,FARNSWORTH,We're not seeing it again! Ask something less stupid.
6513,FRY,"Oh, alright. How 'bout this? What if I never fell into that freezer-doodle and came to the future-jiggy?"
6514,FARNSWORTH,"That question is less stupid, though you asked it in a profoundly stupid way.  What would happen if Fry never came to the future?"
6515,FRY,"Hello? Pizza delivery for ... Icy Wiener?! Aw, crud!  Here's to another lousy Millennium! Ow!  I should have left you floating in the toilet!"
6516,LEELA,What is it?
6517,FARNSWORTH,It appears that the very fabric of space-time has ripped.
6518,BENDER,"Hey, look! An ugly scared guy! Boo!"
6519,FRY,Who are you monsters? Is one of you Icy Wiener?
6520,ZOIDBERG,"If that's his pizza, then I'm icy whatever!"
6521,FRY,"You believe me about the monsters, right, Mr. Panucci?"
6522,PANUCCI,"There's only three real monsters, kid: Dracula, Blacula and Son of Kong. Now quit picking your nose and knead that dough!  Hey! The usual, Professor Hawking?"
6523,HAWKING,No. Today I'd like something good.
6524,PANUCCI,"Hawking, you're alright! I'll make you the usual!"
6525,FRY,Hey! Stephen Hawking! Aren't you that physicist that invented gravity?
6526,HAWKING,Sure. Why not?
6527,FRY,"Let me ask you something: Has anyone ever discovered a hole in nothing with monsters in it?  'Cause if I'm the first, I want them to call it ""a Fry Hole""."
6528,HAWKING,There is nothing to be concerned about. I must go. There is much to do.
6529,PANUCCI,"Hey, Hawking! Your pizza's ready."
6530,HAWKING,Toss it in the garbage!
6531,HAWKING,(from alley) There he is. Seize him.
6532,FRY,(from alley) Who said that?  Hey! What the--? Ooh! Ow! Ow!
6533,FRY,Who are you people?
6534,GORE,I'm Al Gore. And these are my Vice Presidential Action Rangers; A group of top nerds whose sole duty it is to prevent disruptions in the space-time continuum.
6535,FRY,I thought your duty was to cast the tie-breaking vote in the Senate.
6536,GORE,"That, and protect the space-time continuum. Read the constitution!"
6537,FRY,Hmm. So I guess you'll wanna see my Fry Hole.
6538,GORE,"very much so. But first, meet the Action Rangers. You already know Stephen Hawking. Also with us are Nichelle Nichols, a.k.a. Commander Uhura."
6539,NICHOLS,Incoming transmission from MCI one rate department. It sounds like a limited-time offer.
6540,GORE,"Tell them I'm in the tub! To my left you'll recognise Gary Gygax, inventor of Dungeons & Dragons."
6541,GYGAX,Greetings! It's a ...  ... pleasure to meet you!
6542,GORE,"And our summer intern, Deep Blue. The world's foremost chess-playing computer."
6543,DEEP BLUE,Bishop to knight 4.
6544,GORE,"Not all missions can be solved with chess, Deep Blue. Someday you'll understand that."
6545,FRY,"Where am I, anyway?"
6546,NICHOLS,You're travelling in a specially-equipped terrestrial transport module.
6547,GYGAX,A school bus!
6548,FRY,So what do you nerds want?
6549,NICHOLS,It's about that rip in space-time that you saw.
6550,HAWKING,"I call it a ""Hawking Hole""."
6551,FRY,No fair! I saw it first!
6552,HAWKING,Who is The Journal Of Quantum Physics going to believe?
6553,GYGAX,"Mr. Fry, the time disruption indicates that some of that was supposed to happen but didn't, due to a quantum fluctuation."
6554,NICHOLS,That's why we had to beat you with tennis rackets.
6555,GORE,"If we don't go back there and make the event happen, the entire universe will be destroyed! And as an environmentalist, I'm against that."
6556,FRY,So then my chair tilted back and I almost fell into this freezer thingy.
6557,HAWKING,"I call it a ""Hawking Chamber""."
6558,FRY,"But instead of falling in and getting frozen, I missed and wanged my head."
6559,GORE,Well it's obvious what should have happened: That wang to the head should have killed you.
6560,FRY,"Uh, what?"
6561,NICHOLS,Let's finish the job.
6562,GORE,No! Wait! There must be a peaceful--
6563,HAWKING,Hold him down.
6564,DEEP BLUE,Check.
6565,FRY,Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
6566,NICHOLS,Something's wrong. Murder isn't working and that's all we're good at.
6567,GYGAX,Let's try something else. Maybe we should--
6568,GORE,Put the dice away before I take them away.
6569,NICHOLS,Wait. I'm getting an idea. What if Fry was supposed to get frozen?
6570,HAWKING,Yes. Shove him in the tube. It was my idea.
6571,BENDER,"Hey, there he is again. And he brought nerds! Take this!"
6572,GORE,"Get in the tube, dummy! We only have a few seconds before the universe is destroyed."
6573,FRY,Alright. But I need a weapon to fight off drunken robots when I wake up.
6574,GYGAX,Here. Take my plus-one mace.
6575,FRY,"OK, here I go."
6576,GORE,You fool! You foolish fool!
6577,FRY,Eh? What's the worst thing that can happen?
6578,HAWKING,Great. The entire universe was destroyed.
6579,FRY,Destroyed? Then where are we now?
6580,GORE,I don't know. But I can darn well tell you where we're not: The universe.
6581,NICHOLS,Eternity with nerds. It's the Pasadena Star Trek convention all over again.
6582,GYGAX,Anyone wanna play Dungeons & Dragons for the next quadrillion years?
6583,FRY,Sure.
6584,HAWKING,I guess.
6585,DEEP BLUE,Pawn to rook 8.
6586,GORE,I'm a 10th-level Vice President!
6587,FARNSWORTH,"That story was preposterous. Stephen Hawking in a pizzeria! This thing isn't worth the gold it's made of.  Anyway, the fing-longer seems to be arousing success."
6588,FRY,Good work.
6589,LEELA,Congratulations!
6590,AMY,"Right on, Professor!"
6591,FARNSWORTH,So that's what things would be like if I'd invented the fing-longer.  A man can dream though. A man can dream.
6592,THE END,
6593,"""THE HONKING""",
6594,DOCTORBOT,Notify his survivors.
6595,BENDER,(singing) B-E-N-D-E-R! Be-ender!  B-E-N-D-E-R! Be-ender! Sayin' B-E-N-D-ERRR...
6596,HERMES,"Mail call! Amy, here's your designer lingerie catalogue, Fry, Sadie's Bra Parade and Leela, Bulk Underpants Outlet."
6597,LEELA,You buy one pound of underwear and you're on their list forever.
6598,HERMES,"And for Bender, uh-oh: A black-bordered envelope."
6599,AMY,"Oh no, someone you know must've died."
6600,BENDER,"I hope it was one of my enemies, those guys suck!  Oh no, my uncle Vladimir."
6601,FRY,"Oh, I'm sorry, Bender. When's the funeral?"
6602,BENDER,"Tomorrow, at the family castle. Followed by the reading of his will.  Well, I'm rich. Goodbye, losers, whom I've always hated!  C'mon, it'll be fun!"
6603,BENDER,"Uh, pardon me, my good simpleton, could you take us to yon castle?"
6604,ROBOT #1,Some say unholy things happen up there.
6605,ROBOT #2,For example: All of us say that.
6606,FARNSWORTH,Fuf! Superstitious robot mumbo-jumbo.
6607,ROBOT #2,"Mumbo, perhaps. Jumbo, perhaps not! With all your modern science are you any closer to understanding the mystery of how a robot walks or talks?"
6608,FARNSWORTH,"Yes, you idiot.  The circuit diagram is right here on the inside of your case."
6609,ROBOT #2,I choose to believe what I was programmed to believe.
6610,ROBOT #2,I will go this far and no further.
6611,PREACHERBOT,I now commend Vladimir's remains to the earth. Filings to filings; rust to rust.
6612,SOLICITORBOT,"(reading) To my loyal butler, You There, I leave a pittance, to be paid in 20 equal installments of one-twentieth of a pittance each.  To my lazy, spoiled son, Tandy, who never learned the value of a dollar, I leave my entire $10 million fortune."
6613,TANDY,(whispering) Is that a lot?
6614,SOLICITORBOT,"(reading) And to my loving nephew, Bender, assuming he's not responsible for my death, I leave my castle."
6615,BENDER,Yes! Let's stay there tonight.
6616,SOLICITORBOT,(reading) On condition that he spend one night within its walls.
6617,BENDER,"Oh man, there's always a catch."
6618,BENDER,"Ah! I got a good vibe from this place: Nice long dinner table, quiet, well-behaved spiders, graveyard-adjacent. Yep! It's gonna be -"
6619,LEELA,What is it?
6620,BENDER,"That painting, the eyes are watching me!"
6621,FARNSWORTH,Hmm.  It has motor eye sensors attached to motion detectors.
6622,BENDER,"So does my butt, but I don't frame it and put it on the wall! Although... What's that?"
6623,ZOIDBERG,"I don't know, but it's infectious!"
6624,BENDER,"No doubt about it, this place is haunted."
6625,HERMES,"Don't be silly mon, the last ghost died over 200 years ago."
6626,BENDER,The last human ghost. But robot ghosts?
6627,LEELA,(reading) 0101100101. (talking) What does it mean?
6628,BENDER,It's just gibberish.  (reading) 1010011010?!
6629,BENDER,Uncle Vladimir!
6630,VLADIMIR-GHOST,"Come, Bender. You'll like being dead!"
6631,BENDER,That's what they said about being alive.
6632,ROBOT GHOSTS,"(chanting) Join us! Join us! Join us, Bender!"
6633,FARNSWORTH,"Just as I suspected. These robots were buried in improperly shielded coffins. Their programming leaked into the castles wiring through this old, abandoned modem allowing them to project themselves as holograms."
6634,HERMES,Of course! It was so obvious!
6635,FARNSWORTH,"Yes, that sequence of words I said made perfect sense. We really should tell Bender there's nothing to be afraid of."
6636,BENDER,(screaming) No!
6637,FRY,"Bender, wake up!  He's OK! Quick, does anyone have any liquor?"
6638,LEELA,"Bender, what happened?"
6639,BENDER,"Somebody tried to run me over. And not with a normal hover-car. It crept along the ground on round, rubber feet, like a wolf!"
6640,FRY,"Poor Bender, you're seeing things. You've been drinking too much, or too little, I forget how it works with you. Anyway, you haven't drunk exactly the right amount."
6641,AMY,"Maybe he's right, look at these tracks."
6642,LEELA,I think Bender may be telling the truth.]
6643,ZOIDBERG,"Bender, you look awful. I prescribe make-up. Here. It just so happens I have my Mary Kay sample case!"
6644,BENDER,"Ah, I just need sleep. I had nightmares all night about cars running people over."
6645,ZOIDBERG,"Many people dream of a fresh, new look. And Mary Kay can make those dreams come true."
6646,LEELA,Look at this. They found those same rubbery tracks right here in New New York.  There was a hit-and-run by the robot porno theatre.
6647,BENDER,"Robot porno theatre? I was in that...general area, last night. Whoever ran me down on those moors must've followed me back here."
6648,HERMES,"Bender mon, no one's trying to run you over. Stop being a big, hallucinating baby."
6649,BENDER,"Yeah?! Could a big, hallucinating baby do this: (crying) I scared!"
6650,VANDAL #1,I don't know which I like more: Smashing cars or smashing faces.
6651,VANDAL #2,"Well. lucky you don't gotta decide tonight. No come on, we got church tomorrow. Did you hear something?"
6652,VANDAL #1,"Ah, it was probably just a golden marmoset."
6653,VANDAL #2,That don't sound like any golden marmoset I ever heard.
6654,VANDAL #1,Made it!
6655,VANDAL #2,"So anyway, what're you wearing tomorrow?"
6656,BENDER,Where...? What the...?  Transmission fluid? Where have I been? What happened?
6657,SAL,"Get outta here, yous lazy bum!"
6658,BENDER,"Please, I'm scared."
6659,SAL,"We're all scared, it's the human condition. Why do you thinks I put on this tough-guy facade? Now beat it!"
6660,BENDER,"I passed out around midnight, which is much earlier that usual, and when I woke up, I found these in my chest cabinet."
6661,FRY,"Aw, relax buddy. You were probably just shooting some big, fuzzy craps."
6662,BENDER,"No, I think I may have hurt someone. Oh Lord, I'm on the verge of a nervous meltdown."
6663,FRY,"Geez Bender, you're scaring me. You're going wacko!"
6664,BENDER,"You're right, I need professional help. And damn the expense."
6665,BENDER,Damn the expense!
6666,GYPSY,"My friend, you have nothing to worry about. Except a nightmare-ish life of unremitting horror!"
6667,BENDER,Phew!
6668,GYPSY,"For, you see, you are a were-car."
6669,BENDER,A were-car?
6670,GYPSY,The car that ran you down on the moors was also a were-car. It beamed a virus to you through its demonic headlights.
6671,LEELA,That's crazy!
6672,GYPSY,"Yes. So crazy that it must be true! Each midnight, when your clock resets to zero, your hardware reconfigures into a murderous, four-wheeled car."
6673,BENDER,I can't keep running people over. I'm not famous enough to get away with it. Can't you help me?
6674,GYPSY,Yes. But you must be willing to pay a terrible price.
6675,BENDER,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
6676,GYPSY,Follow me.
6677,GYPSY,"According to this ancient read-me file, your only hope is to destroy the original were-car."
6678,BENDER,I'm with you.
6679,GYPSY,"In its death throes, the dread car will beam out the virus's uninstall program, thus ridding you of the curse."
6680,BENDER,"Otherwise, I can never die?"
6681,GYPSY,Who said that? Sure you can die. You want to die?
6682,BENDER,No! I wanna live! There's still too many things I don't own!
6683,GYPSY,"Then live on, forever cursed. Each night, your attacks will become more gruesome until, one dark night you are doomed to kill your dearest friend."
6684,FRY,I wouldn't wanna be me right now.
6685,GYPSY,"Now go! Go!  Uh, could one of you just...? Ah, forget it. I'll just sleep here."
6686,LEELA,There. No rampaging for you tonight.
6687,BENDER,Wouldn't it make sense to weld everyone except me to the wall?
6688,LEELA,"Just relax, Bender. Tomorrow we'll pry you down, have a nice breakfast and then go hunt down and slaughter that ancient evil."
6689,FRY,"It'll be a rich, full day."
6690,LEELA,"Well, goodnight. I'm gonna go make my dinners for the next month and freeze them."
6691,FRY,"(shouting) Bender, no!"
6692,LEELA,"(shouting) Fry, stay back!"
6693,FRY,(shouting) You jerk. I thought I was your best friend. What kind of two-timing kill-mobile are you?
6694,FRY,"I can't believe this. Bender is supposed to murder his closest friend, which I thought was me. But he went straight for you. He didn't even try to second-degree murder me."
6695,LEELA,Could you give me some help? I think Bender crushed my foot.
6696,FRY,Stop rubbing it in.
6697,BENDER,"Oh God. Fry, I'm so glad to see you. I didn't hurt you did I?"
6698,FRY,"Not physically. But why don't you ask your new best friend, Leela?"
6699,BENDER,I tried to run you over?
6700,LEELA,"It was very sweet of you, Bender."
6701,BENDER,"Fry, it doesn't mean anything. I have love enough for two."
6702,FRY,"Words. Nothing sweet, sweet words that turn into bitter orange wax in my ears."
6703,LEELA,"Enough with the feelings, you two. If we're gonna cure Bender we've got to go back to the castle and hunt down the original were-car."
6704,FRY,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
6705,LEELA,"Cursed, got it."
6706,BENDER,Whatever.
6707,LEELA,The tracks lead here.
6708,FRY,"Thanks, eagle eye."
6709,LEELA,"Now it's daylight, so he should be in robot form. But be careful. Many robots are stupid and violent."
6710,BENDER,"(sarcastic) I wish I was stupid and violent. Then we'd see what's what, I'd pound him till -"
6711,YOKELBOT,"Get ye to your house, ye ignorant villagers."
6712,LEELA,"We are not ignorant villagers, we're sophisticated New New Yorkers. Whup his butt!"
6713,YOKELBOT,Stop! What are ye doing?
6714,BENDER,"We're whaling on the original were-car, which is you, you jerk."
6715,YOKELBOT,Ye think me be he?
6716,BENDER,Sí.
6717,YOKELBOT,"Nee. I mean, ""no"". I was given the curse many a year ago while on a bird-watching trip to the Arctic..."
6718,YOKELBOT,"(voice-over) ...I was attacked by a vicious, motorised sled. The natives called it the abominable snowmobile."
6719,INUITBOT,"Yes, it's true. I ran over that bird-watching jerk and a hundred others. Even my best friend from aromatherapy school."
6720,FRY,I once had a best friend who liked to smell things with me.
6721,INUITBOT,"Alas, I'm afraid I'm not the original were-car. I received the curse while taking a learning annex class from a famous robot actor."
6722,INUITBOT,(voice-over) You know him as Calculon.
6723,CALCULON,"(dramatically) Oh, fate most cruel, would that my boundless acting skills would avail me a sword with which to slay this wretched curse."
6724,BENDER,Let's kick him some more.
6725,CALCULON,"No, wait, let me explain. (dramatically) It all began one fateful night a thousand years ago."
6726,BENDER,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. You're a thousand years old? Your bio says you're 27!"
6727,CALCULON,"Lies! I change my identity and upgrade my appearance every few decades to avoid suspicion. I was all of history's great acting robots: Acting Unit 0.8, Thespo-mat, David Duchovny!"
6728,FRY,"Look, are you the original were-car or not?"
6729,CALCULON,"No, but you are nearing the end of your search, for you see I was attacked by the original were-car."
6730,BENDER,Give us a name MacButt!
6731,CALCULON,"The year was 2019, and I was just a lowly robot arm..."
6732,CALCULON,"(voice-over) ...working in an automotive research lab. I was working on Project Satan......a savage, intelligent military vehicle built from the most evil parts of the most evil cars in all the world. The steering wheel from Hitler's staff car, the left-turn signal from Charles Manson's VW, the windshield from that car that played Knight Rider."
6733,FRY,Knight Rider wasn't evil.
6734,CALCULON,His windshield wipers were. It didn't come up much in the show though. Anyway...
6735,CALCULON,"(voice-over) ...Only after bringing Project Satan to life did they discover they had made a horrible mistake.  For you see, it was pure evil."
6736,LEELA,So what happened to Project Satan?
6737,CALCULON,"(voice-over) It's either in Paris, or much more likely..."
6738,CALCULON,(voice-over) ...still in the abandoned automotive lab.
6739,LEELA,You guys distract the were-car and I'll kill it by plugging its exhaust pipe with this silver potato.
6740,BENDER,"(whispering) Psst, there it is."
6741,LEELA,It looks so unhappy. Excuse me? Are you Project Satan?  Don't be afraid. We know what you are.
6742,PROJECT SATAN,You do?
6743,LEELA,Would you like us to...put you out of your misery?
6744,PROJECT SATAN,Misery? What misery? I love killing people! Squishing them till their organs squirt out like chunky mustard.
6745,BENDER,"Look, everyone love killing people, but I don't wanna hurt my friends."
6746,LEELA,Oh no! It's midnight.
6747,BENDER,"Hey, this is starting to feel pretty good!"
6748,LEELA,"Fry, distract him."
6749,FRY,"Hey, Project Satan! Over here! I'm a blind pedestrian. 20 points!"
6750,LEELA,"Oh no, there's no exhaust pipe!"
6751,PROJECT SATAN,"That's right, thanks to Ed Begley Jr.'s electric motor, the most evil propulsion system ever conceived!  Take whichever one you want."
6752,BENDER,"Oh boy, I feel like a car in a candy store!"
6753,FRY,"(gasping) Yes! He chose me! He's trying to kill me! Leela, I'm so happy!  (talking) Oh, thanks Bender.  (choking) Too tight! Too tight!"
6754,LEELA,Whoa!
6755,BENDER,Uh-oh.
6756,LEELA,"Bender, you're cured! But what happened to Fry?"
6757,BENDER,(crying) I must've killed him. He's my best friend and I killed him. I never felt so empty inside.
6758,FRY,"Bender, I'm alive!  You didn't hurt me at all. But I know you wanted to, and that's what matters.  Here's to you."
6759,BENDER,"Hey, that's my last beer, you bastard. I'll kill you!"
6760,FRY,"I'll kill you too, buddy. I'll kill you too!"
6761,THE END,
6762,"""WAR IS THE H WORD""",
6763,FRY,"Hm, Spider, Hubble, Nitrogum...ooh, Big Pink! It's the only gum with the breath-freshening power of ham."
6764,BENDER,And it pinkens your teeth while you chew.
6765,CLERK,"Alright, sergeant, $100 worth of pixie stix and porno mags with your 5% military discount comes to $95.  That'll be 40 cents."
6766,FRY,I believe you're forgetting about our 5% military discount.
6767,CLERK,Well that's only for people in the military.
6768,BENDER,What?! This is the worst kind of discrimination. The kind against me!
6769,CLERK,"Alright, look. Our policy is, if for any reason you're not completely satisfied, I hate you."
6770,BENDER,"OK, now I'm mad."
6771,FRY,"Full price for gum? That dog won't hunt, Monsignor."
6772,BENDER,Hello. We're here because we...uh...love our planet!
6773,MAN,"Sign here on the dotted line, patriots. Then I'll give you your discount cards."
6774,FRY,"Just out of curiosity, we could use the cards to buy gum, then immediately quit the army, right?"
6775,BENDER,"You know, playing you all for chumps?"
6776,MAN,"Correct. There's no obligation.  Unless, of course, war were declared."
6777,FRY,What's that?
6778,MAN,War were declared.
6779,FARNSWORTH,"Now be careful, Fry. And if you kill anyone, make sure to eat their heart, to gain their courage. Their rich, tasty courage."
6780,HERMES,I don't want you to worry about your jobs while you're away. That's why I'm firing you now.
6781,LEELA,I wanna enlist. My friends always die if I'm not there to save them.
6782,ZAPP,"Sorry, but the army's instituted a men-only policy."
6783,LEELA,What?!
6784,ZAPP,"It's shameful, I agree. In the olden days, I proudly fought alongside female troops, shoulder to, uh, shoulder. Alas, after a series of deadly blunders caused by distracting low-cut fatigues and lots of harmless pinching, the army decided women weren't fit for service. Not when I'm in charge."
6785,LEELA,"You know, Zapp, someone ought to teach you a lesson."
6786,ZAPP,"If it's a lesson in love, watch out. I suffer from a very sexy learning disability. What do I call it, Kif?"
6787,KIF,Sex-lexia.
6788,ZAPP,"Men, you're lucky men. Soon you'll all be fighting for your planet. Many of you will be dying for your planet. A few of you will be forced through a fine mesh screen for your planet. They will be the luckiest of all."
6789,BENDER,"Great, we're gonna die."
6790,FRY,And this ham gum is all bone.
6791,ZAPP,"Now to present the logistics of our mission, the Commander-in-Chief. Please welcome the original Gerber Baby, Earth President Richard M. Nixon."
6792,NIXON,"This is the brass ring, fellas......planet Spheron 1!"
6793,FRY,Cool effect!
6794,ZAPP,"It's a desolate, ugly little planet with absolutely no natural resources or strategic value. Questions?"
6795,SOLDIER #1,Why is this godforsaken planet worth dying for?
6796,ZAPP,"Don't ask me, you're the one who's going to be dying."
6797,FRY,"Uh, just so we'll know, who's the enemy?"
6798,ZAPP,"A valid question.  We know nothing about their language, their history or what they look like. But we can assume this: They stand for everything we don't stand for. Also, they told me you guys look like dorks."
6799,BENDER,They look like dorks!
6800,ZAPP,"What's the matter, private? Tent got your tongue? (chuckling) Tent got your... (talking) Kif, write that down and send it to Humour In Uniform."
6801,FRY,Whoa! Check out that guy. He makes Speedy Gonzales look like Regular Gonzales.
6802,KIF,"That new recruit is phenomenal, sir."
6803,ZAPP,"Yes. He edged out my old mark by two seconds......and 16 minutes...and 12 hours. I do plan to finish someday, Kif. Good hustle, soldier."
6804,LEELA,"(disguised, deeper voice) Uh, sorry, sir. I was still in attack mode. You know how testosterone is."
6805,ZAPP,"As a bubbling Crock-Pot of male hormones, I sure do. What's your name, private?"
6806,LEELA,"(disguised, deeper voice) Lee --  ..la...man. La Man...Lemon! Lee Lemon, sir."
6807,ZAPP,"Lemon, you're a man's man. You're a man's man's man. More importantly, your hand, while firm and masculine, is soft as a velvet child. What lotion do you use?"
6808,LEELA,"(disguised, deeper voice) Pert and Popular, sir."
6809,ZAPP,"Roger that. Kif, get me ten cases of Pert and Popular."
6810,KIF,"What shall I do with your Jergens, sir?"
6811,ZAPP,Squirt it on some homeless man with dry elbows.  Private Lee Lemon may well be the finest recruit I've seen in all my years of service. That young man fills me with hope and some other emotions that are weird and deeply confusing to me.
6812,KIF,Ew.
6813,ZAPP,(sexfully) Hello!
6814,NIXON,"Mmm. Now that's a nice rosé. So, anyway, we open up the panda crate, wouldn't you know it, the damn thing's dead! Up-chucked it's bamboo. True story."
6815,ZAPP,"Uh-huh, uh-huh. That's whatever you were talking about for you."
6816,FRY,Mind if we sit with you?
6817,LEELA,"(disguised, deeper voice) Uh, hey, why the hell would I? We're all guys here. Sweaty, hairy, gassy guys."
6818,FRY,Good point...I guess.
6819,BENDER,"You're my kind of soldier, Lemon. A foul-mouthed, barrel-chested, beer-bellied pile of ugly muscle."
6820,HICK,So. Any you fellas got a special lady back home?
6821,FRY,"Well, I sort of a have a thing for this girl I work with."
6822,LEELA,"Really? (disguised, deeper voice) What type is she? You know, blonde, or Chinese, or cyclops?"
6823,FRY,Cyclops.
6824,LEELA,"(disguised, deeper voice) Aw, she sounds sweet."
6825,BENDER,"But sweet girls aren't for you, eh? You hard-fighting, hard-farting, ugly, ugly son of a --"
6826,LEELA,"(disguised, deeper voice) Stop! Stop flattering me!"
6827,ZAPP,"(shouting) Ten hut!  Well, well, well. If it isn't Lee Lemon. The flaming star of Brannigan's Rough Rangers. Say, uh, Lemon, do you like to read? I just got a great book on tape. It's about life in ancient Greece and --"
6828,LEELA,"(disguised, deeper voice) Sir, the alarm. I think I'd better --"
6829,ZAPP,Shh. Don't talk. Just go.
6830,NIXON,We are now in position above Spheron 1. This is the moment we were training for all yesterday afternoon.
6831,ZAPP,"And now for the battle plan. As you all know, the key to victory is the element of surprise. Surprise!"
6832,FRY,It's creepy here.
6833,SOLDIER #1,This is the worst part. The calm before the battle.
6834,FRY,And then the battle's not so bad?
6835,SOLDIER #1,"Oh, right. I forgot about the battle."
6836,FRY,What's happening?
6837,HICK,Holy shoot! Looky!
6838,FRY,The enemy! They're balls!
6839,LEELA,"Charge your gun, Fry."
6840,FRY,"Oh, right."
6841,ZAPP,"Watch where you're shooting, private. You spooked Felicity.  There, there, boy."
6842,SOLDIER #1,(hoarse) Give this to my son.
6843,BENDER,You got it!
6844,SOLDIER #1,(hoarse) Wait. I didn't tell you where he lives.
6845,BENDER,"Hey, I think your son might also like those boots."
6846,HICK,"Cover us, buddy. You've got the only wounded-up positron shooter.  Fry, you emu-bellied coward!"
6847,FRY,(shouting) Bender! No!
6848,BENDER,"If they put me on a stamp, tell them to use the young Bender."
6849,P.A. ANNOUNCER,"(on tannoy) Incoming wounded. All operating personnel report to tent four, repeat, four. I mean five! Repeat, four."
6850,NURSE,"Are you ready to operate, doctor?"
6851,ZOIDBERG,"I'd love to, but first I have to perform surgery.  I kid, I kid!"
6852,ZOIDBERG,Scalpel.  Blood bucket.  Priest. Next patient.
6853,IHAWK,"Gee, Zoidberg. Leave some for the enemy to kill."
6854,NURSE,Leave Dr. Zoidberg alone. He has twice the training you do.
6855,IHAWK,"Yeah, he's a doctor and a butcher!"
6856,ZOIDBERG,"See, this is how it starts. First with he jokes, then comes the heavy stuff."
6857,IHAWK,When will the killing end?
6858,ZAPP,"Look at this sissy, Kif. While others were fighting and dying pointlessly, he was hiding in a hole, wallowing in a pool of his own cowardice."
6859,FRY,That wasn't cowardice.
6860,ZAPP,"I'm depromoting you, soldier. Kif, what's the most humiliating job there is?"
6861,KIF,Being your assistant.
6862,ZAPP,"Wrong! Being your assistant! Private Fry, you will henceforth serve as Kif's assistant."
6863,FRY,That doesn't sound too bad.
6864,KIF,"(uncharacteristically nasty) You speak when I tell you to, you filthy worm!"
6865,ZOIDBERG,I'm afraid he's gone.
6866,HICK,"Whoa, doc, I ain't dead."
6867,ZOIDBERG,"Excuse me, I believe I'm the doctor."
6868,IHAWK,"Believe it all you want, that won't make it true.  (mauldlin) This isn't a war, it's a murder.  (irreverent) This isn't a war, it's a moider!"
6869,HICK,"Bender, old buddy. Hang in there."
6870,ZAPP,"Here lies the bravest soldier I've seen since my mirror got grease on it. I hereby order that in Bender's honour, he be melted down and made into a statue of himself."
6871,NIXON,"Slow down there, Starsky, I'm up to something here. I want this robot fixed. Fixed like Kennedy fixed the 1960 election. Damn bean-eating war hero!"
6872,NURSE,"Are you read to operate, doctor?"
6873,IHAWK,"I'd love to, but first I have to perform surgery."
6874,ZOIDBERG,That's my joke! I'll kill you!
6875,ZAPP,"Ah! Pre-war scotch!  Welcome, Lieutenant Bender. You're looking sharp."
6876,BENDER,I got wheels! With clickety-clack-ers.
6877,ZAPP,"Damnit, Kif, where's the little umbrella? That's what makes it a scotch-on-the-rocks!"
6878,KIF,"Actually, sir --"
6879,ZAPP,Make me a new one.
6880,KIF,"Use a brush, you dunderhead! And mix these mixed nuts. I see two almonds touching!"
6881,NIXON,"Now, listen here, Bender. This war is in danger of going all quagmire on me. So I'm sending you on one last mission."
6882,BENDER,Hot diggidy daffodil!
6883,NIXON,A mission of peace.
6884,BENDER,(disappointed) Oh!
6885,ZAPP,"You'll be negotiating with the aliens' mysterious leaders, the Brain Balls. They've got a lot of brains and they've got a lot of cutzpa!"
6886,NIXON,"Accompanying you will be our top peace negotiator, Henry Kissenger."
6887,KISSENGER,How are you?
6888,BENDER,Is he any good?
6889,NIXON,"Looking like that, he talked his way into Jill St. John's bed. Nuff said!"
6890,NIXON,"(singing) I'm so dizzy, my head is spinning. Like a whirlpool it never ends."
6891,ZAPP,A little lower. Lower. Lower. A lot lower. Too low...! Lower!
6892,FRY,"(singing) I'm walking on sunshine, whoa-oh."
6893,ZAPP,"Private Lemon, no need to leave.  My stall just became free."
6894,LEELA,"(disguised, deeper voice) Maybe you should put on a towel, sir."
6895,ZAPP,"Right. Right!  I'm about to try the new lotion you recommended. (sexfully) If I should accidentally put too much on my hands, perhaps I could rub it onto you."
6896,NIXON,Brannigan!
6897,ZAPP,Hm?
6898,NIXON,"My God, cover yourself. I didn't live a thousand years and travel a quadrillion miles to look at another man's gizmo."
6899,ZAPP,"Uh, sorry, Mr. President, I didn't realise. Kif, raise him up about nipple-high."
6900,NIXON,"Come on, Brannigan. Stuff yourself into a uniform. We've gotta get off this planet before the bomb goes off."
6901,LEELA,"(disguised, deeper voice) Bomb?! What bomb?"
6902,ZAPP,The one we had the doctors implant in that gullible Bender robot.
6903,NIXON,Zapp. Zapp!
6904,ZAPP,Hm?
6905,NIXON,Inspect the troops later. It's time to activate the bomb.
6906,KISSENGER,"Now, as for economic cooperation --"
6907,BENDER,Whoa! Scuse me.
6908,P.A. ANNOUNCER,(on tannoy) Attention: All personnel evacuate the planet immediately. And not just because it's meat loaf night.
6909,ZAPP,"Come along, Lemon before this whole dump blows up."
6910,LEELA,"(disguised, deeper voice) Uh, commander? Could you tell me when the bomb is exploding?"
6911,ZAPP,"Of course, my significant soldier. The bomb is voice activated. It will detonate the instant the robot unwittingly speaks a certain word."
6912,FRY,What's the word...uh...sir?
6913,ZAPP,"It's the one word the robot uses more than any other. We got it from this convenient database of his 10 most frequently-used words.  Number 10, chump; number nine, chumpette; number eight, yours; number seven, up; number six, pimpmobile; number five, bite; number four, my......number three, shiny; number two, daffodil. And Bender's number one most frequently uttered word, the word which, if uttered, will blow up this entire planet: Ass."
6914,FRY,We don't have long!
6915,BRAIN BALL #1,"We demand bouncing, followed by rolling, followed by rolling of the third type."
6916,KISSENGER,Say what?
6917,BENDER,"My chair's too hard. It's a real pain in the...uh, whattya call it? Lower back! Yeah, that whole region."
6918,FRY,"OK, I gotta break down that gate, beat up those three guards, steal that chopper and rescue Bender.  Hey, I did it! Wait, that's not me."
6919,LEELA,(shouting) Come on. We gotta save Bender.
6920,FRY,"You wanna save him too, Lemon? You barely know him."
6921,LEELA,"Fry, don't you recognise me?"
6922,FRY,Hermes?
6923,ZAPP,"Lee? When will I see you again?  The two of you are good friends? But I thought we would be good friends. (contemptuous) Well, let's see how friendly you get when you're sharing a prison cell!"
6924,LEELA,"Hey, Zapp!"
6925,ZAPP,Leela!
6926,FRY,Leela!
6927,ZAPP,"So it's you I've been attracted to! Oh, God, I've never been so happy to be beaten up by a woman."
6928,LEELA,Let's do it again sometime.
6929,BRAIN BALL #2,The elders tell of a young ball much like you. He bounced three metres in the air. Then he bounced 1.8 metres in the air. Then he bounced four metres in the air. Do I make myself clear?
6930,KISSENGER,"Mr. Ambassador, our people tell the same story. Oy."
6931,BENDER,"These balls are making me testy. If they don't stop bouncing and jiggling, I swear I'm gonna shove this treaty up their -- Wait a second. Where do you shove things up a ball?"
6932,KISSENGER,This isn't a productive area of discussion.
6933,LEELA,We're here. I followed the bouncing balls.  I'll keep the chopper at a safe altitude while you parachute down.
6934,FRY,"OK, my best friend's life is at stake. I can finally prove that I'm not a coward. Will you push me?"
6935,LEELA,(shouting) I already did!
6936,FRY,"(shouting) Thank you!  At last, war has made me into a man."
6937,KISSENGER,"Please, gentlemen. We must put an end to the bloodshed. We have all seen too many body bags and ball sacks."
6938,BRAIN BALL #1,We cannot condone bouncing of the seventh variety.
6939,BENDER,Enough of this crap! I'm catching the next pimpmobile outta here! But before I go I have one thing to say.  Bite my shiny metal --
6940,FRY,Stop! You can't say the next word.
6941,BENDER,"Up yours, chump, I said it 906 times before lunch."
6942,FRY,"Bender, if you say the A-word and you'll blow this planet straight to the H-word!"
6943,KISSENGER,"Young man, you have the bravery of a hero and breath as fresh as a summer ham.  What? What is funny?"
6944,BENDER,"Bender's got the upper hand now.  The name of the game is ""Make Bender Happy Or He Blows Up The Planet"".  I'd rather die and take everybody with me than sit here one more minute listening to these idiots talk about bouncing!"
6945,BRAIN BALL #1,"Please, stay calm. There's no need to bounce of the handle."
6946,BENDER,"That's it, I'm saying it! A is for --"
6947,BRAIN BALL #1,"Wait, stop! We give in to all of Earth's demands. The war is over. Our home planet is yours."
6948,FRY,"All right! Hey. Wait a minute! This is your home planet? We're the evil, invading aliens?"
6949,BRAIN BALL #2,Correct.
6950,BENDER,Then I guess you learned a valuable lesson: Don't mess with Earth.
6951,BRAIN BALL #1,May you bounce in peace.
6952,BENDER,Get the hell off my planet.
6953,FARNSWORTH,"Well, that's it. Let's reactivate him. (shouting) Wake up!"
6954,BENDER,"Hey, chumps and chumpettes. Did you get the bomb out? Can I go back to saying the word I love to say?"
6955,ZOIDBERG,I'm sorry but we couldn't remove it.
6956,FARNSWORTH,It's stuck in there with glue or something. I don't know.
6957,BENDER,"(ironic) Well, this is just great! What's the point of living if I can't say ""ass""? Hey, I didn't blow up! Ass, ass, ass, ass, ass! Alright! I'm back in the saddle!"
6958,LEELA,We couldn't disarm the bomb so we reset the word that triggers it.
6959,AMY,It's from the list of words you almost never say.
6960,BENDER,"That's using your ass. So, what's the word?"
6961,HERMES,We think it's better if you don't know.
6962,BENDER,"Oh, come on. I'm not gonna say it. Please? Oh, is it ""please""?"
6963,FRY,No.
6964,BENDER,"Hm, words I never say. Oh, I know! ""Thanks""!"
6965,LEELA,"Bender, stop trying to destroy the world."
6966,BENDER,"Wait, wait, wait, wait. Is it ""sorry""? No. ""Funderful""? Uh, ""nonalcoholic""?"
6967,AMY,Quit it!
6968,FRY,Bender!
6969,HERMES,"Stop it, mon!"
6970,ZOIDBERG,Enough already!
6971,BENDER,"(from lab) ""Compassion""? ""Shrimptoast""? ""Antiquing""?  I'm alright!"
6972,THE END,
6973,"""THE CRYONIC WOMAN""",
6974,FRY,"Giant Space Robot, this is Captain Fry of the USS Planet Express Ship; We come in peace."
6975,BENDER,Tough luck!
6976,FRY,"Well, we destroyed the toy spaceship. Now what are we gonna do?"
6977,BENDER,"Hey, look! The keys to the real spaceship."
6978,FRY,Do you think we should?
6979,BENDER,"(firmly) Yes, I do."
6980,FARNSWORTH,"Leela, have you seen the keys to the spaceship?"
6981,LEELA,I must've left them onboard.
6982,FARNSWORTH,"Eh, wha'? I mean, what?"
6983,LEELA,Relax. The ship's not going anywhere. I anchored it with the unbreakable diamond tether.
6984,AMY,"Oh, no!"
6985,HERMES,Sweet ghost of Babylon.
6986,ZOIDBERG,This isn't good for Zoidberg!
6987,FRY,"Woo, yeah!"
6988,BENDER,Woo-hoo!
6989,BENDER,"Hey, Fry, I'm steering with my ass!"
6990,FRY,That's the best thing I ever saw!
6991,ITALIAN #1,You stink!
6992,ITALIAN #1,"Alright, yeah!"
6993,ITALIAN #2,We like you a lot!
6994,FRY,That was great!
6995,BENDER,And no one suspects a thing!  Whoa! And that's how we learned our lesson!
6996,FARNSWORTH,You've gone too far this time - all three of you!
6997,LEELA,What did I do?
6998,FARNSWORTH,"You left the keys in the ignition. I mean, look at those two. Wasn't it obvious what would happen?"
6999,FRY,"Yeah, Leela."
7000,BENDER,We're all very disappointed in you.
7001,FARNSWORTH,"I should fire you three right now, but I'm just not that cold-hearted."
7002,HERMES,You're all fired.
7003,ZOIDBERG,"Goodbye, friends. I'll miss you.  Good riddance to them. Now Zoidberg is the popular one!"
7004,FARNSWORTH,"Yes, yes! Let's all talk to Zoidberg."
7005,AMY,"Hey, Dr. Zoidberg, I've been thinking. Do you think we could go out?"
7006,FARNSWORTH,"So, Zoidberg. What's new?"
7007,HERMES,"Tell me, Zoidberg: Is it carapace or carapass?"
7008,ZOIDBERG,"Oh, you know...!"
7009,FRY,"What are we supposed to do for money? All I've got is my frequent taffy eater's card, my first moustache......and this picture of me and my old girlfriend, Michelle, and that ski instructor she was just friends with."
7010,BENDER,"Pardon me, brother. Care to donate to the Anti-Mugging-You Fund?  Ow!"
7011,LEELA,"We don't need to beg, Bender. For God's sake, we're not veterans!"
7012,FRY,"Well, what do you suggest? A daring daylight robbery of Fort Knox on elephant-back? That's the dumbest thing I ever heard!"
7013,LEELA,"No, we can get jobs."
7014,BENDER,But we just had jobs!
7015,LEELA,"Fortunately, I still have our old career chips."
7016,FRY,Our what?
7017,LEELA,Career chips.  You remember? They assign you the job you're best at.  I tried to give you one and you ran away.  It's how we met!
7018,FRY,And then what happened?
7019,LEELA,Just give me your hand.
7020,FRY,Ow!
7021,LEELA,Baby!  Ow!
7022,LEELA,I'd like to reapply for my old job: Counselling defrostees and assigning them careers.
7023,IPGEE,"Oh, I was hoping you would come back! I even saved your poster of a chimp expressing your distaste for Mondays."
7024,LEELA,"Monday Monkey lives for the weekend, sir."
7025,IPGEE,"Just put your hand under the scanner so I can verify your career chip.  Calcutta, we have a problem."
7026,LEELA,Delivery boy? I must have mixed up the chips. It's a simple mis -
7027,IPGEE,"Oh, here's a cryogenic counsellor! Do you like Mondays?"
7028,FRY,They're OK.
7029,IPGEE,Then we'll have to redecorate your office. How do you feel about it helping to be crazy to work here but not being necessary?
7030,BENDER,"Hey, let's see what it says about me."
7031,IPGEE,"Welcome aboard, sir."
7032,TERRY,"Remember, when the tube opens, say...(dramatically)...""Welcome to the world of tomorrow!"""
7033,FRY,"Hey, I was frozen. I think I know what people wanna hear when they first wake up.  Bathroom's that way."
7034,FRY,"So, while you're on the Probulator, tell me, what brings you to the future?"
7035,MAN,"Oh, well, I wanted to meet Shakespeare and I figured that time was cyclical."
7036,FRY,"Nope. Straight line.  Ah, the Probulator's done."
7037,MAN,That wasn't so bad.
7038,FRY,"Oh, wait, it hasn't started yet.  OK, it's about to start."
7039,BENDER,"Welcome to the future, human slave. Ah, relax, chum. I'm not really a giant fly!  I'm a horrible robot!  Kill all humans!"
7040,TERRY,Dear God! He's having a heart attack!
7041,BENDER,"Ah, they'll probably find a cure for that in the future."
7042,TERRY,We have a cure for it now!
7043,BENDER,"Oh, good. Then you won't mind if I use this."
7044,FRY,Nothing like a power nap.
7045,OLD MAN,"Oh, flies! Flies and gorillas!"
7046,BENDER,"Stay beautiful, doll-face!  That Probulator sure knows how to please a man. So, what's for lunch?"
7047,FRY,I ordered a pizza.
7048,LEELA,"Pizza delivery for...I.C. Wiener.  Yeah, very funny. Now cough up the $12.95."
7049,FRY,"Sorry, but if it's not here in half an hour, it's free."
7050,LEELA,It's only been 23 minutes.
7051,FRY,"Well, uh, I've got 33 minutes."
7052,CHEF,"It's only been-a 23 minutes, you dumb-a canolli. You got a problem, we can take it outside."
7053,FRY,"OK, I'll fight the box. I think I can take him."
7054,LEELA,"Fry, just pay me. I still owe 30 bucks on this uniform."
7055,CHEF,"35, you stupid meatball."
7056,BENDER,Who should be unfreeze next?
7057,FRY,"No.  No!  Oh, my God! It's Pauly Shore!"
7058,BENDER,Alright!
7059,FRY,"Mr. Shore, I loved you in Bio-Dome. You sure caused some trouble in that bubble!"
7060,SHORE,"Rest assured, if it rhymes, I can cause trouble in it."
7061,FRY,"Hey, now that you're in the future, you can go live in an actual bio-dome!"
7062,SHORE,"An unattractive prospect. While researching for the role, I ran computer simulations demonstrating, incontravertably, that the whole bio-enclosure concept is fundamentally flawed. Be it expressed via dome, sphere, cube or even a stately tetrahedron, buuuddy!"
7063,FRY,Oh.  How did you wind up getting frozen?
7064,SHORE,"Well, while filming Encino Man my intellectual curiosity re: cryogenics was peaked, and I resolved to freeze the weasel."
7065,FRY,The weasel?
7066,SHORE,"Hey, listen, skippy. I was supposed to be unfrozen in Hollywood for the thousandth anniversary screening of Jury Duty II. How come I'm not there?"
7067,FRY,I woke you up early so we could hang out and do stuff.
7068,SHORE,Like what?
7069,FRY,I love this job.
7070,BENDER,Me too.
7071,FRY,Showtime! (hoarse) I'll pretend to be dying of space plague.
7072,BENDER,Boo?
7073,FRY,Michelle!
7074,BENDER,"Oh, my God!"
7075,MICHELLE,Fry? Is it really you?
7076,FRY,I don't know. Is it really you?
7077,MICHELLE,What do you mean you don't know? Are you you or not?
7078,FRY,Who wants to know?
7079,MICHELLE,"Oh, Fry, it is you!"
7080,FRY,"I don't get it, Michelle. The last time I saw you, you were doing great. You had just dumped me and you were well on your way to getting you life back on track. Why'd you freeze yourself?"
7081,MICHELLE,"Oh, Fry. After you left, things took a turn for the worse. I got married."
7082,FRY,I'm sorry.
7083,MICHELLE,"(voice-over) His name was Charles. He attended a law school so prestigious, the basketball team was coached by Ruth Bader Ginsberg.  I put him through law school by working as a dog walker for antisocial dogs."
7084,FRY,Sorry.
7085,MICHELLE,"(voice-over) But soon after Charles graduated, our marriage ran into difficulties."
7086,FRY,"Uh, sorry."
7087,MICHELLE,"(voice-over) Desperately depressed, I turned to the one thing that could lessen my pain: A carnival. Unfortunately, a corn dog bone got lodged in the control panel of the Spizzler, and I had to ride it for eight hours."
7088,FRY,(voice-over) Sorry.
7089,MICHELLE,(voice-over) But it did give me a chance to think...
7090,FRY,I'm sorry.
7091,MICHELLE,...and I remembered the last time I was truly happy; When I was with you.
7092,FRY,Aww. So you froze yourself to come look for me?
7093,MICHELLE,"No, I did it to get a fresh start. I didn't know what had happened to you - no one did. The police were going to conduct a search but your parents felt it was a waste of taxpayer money."
7094,FRY,"That's the same reason they kept me out of school. So, no one even cared that I was gone?"
7095,MICHELLE,Not really. Except for one person.
7096,FRY,Who was it?
7097,MICHELLE,Everything is so different.
7098,FRY,Not everything. There's still a roach problem.
7099,MICHELLE,Ew!
7100,MICHELLE,Eurgh.
7101,FRY,"Nowadays, people aren't interested in art that's not tattooed on fat guys."
7102,SAL,I'm on loan from the Louvre.
7103,LEELA,"Please, professor. Give us our jobs back. We deserve another chance."
7104,BENDER,"Yeah, and if you won't give me another chance, perhaps you'd give one to......Og, gorilla emperor of Earth!"
7105,FARNSWORTH,"I'm sorry, Og, but I've got a new crew."
7106,FARNSWORTH,"So, how was delivery to Fantasy Planet, where everyone's fantasies come to life?"
7107,AMY,Great!
7108,HERMES,Organised!
7109,ZOIDBERG,"For one beautiful night, I knew what it was to be a grandmother. Subjugated, yet honoured."
7110,FARNSWORTH,"You see, Og? Everything's running smoothly, yes. And with Fry fired, I can finally leave my jigsaw puzzles out without him eating the pieces."
7111,LEELA,Forget about Fry. You can hire us back and he'd never have to know.
7112,FRY,"Hey, guys."
7113,LEELA,"Oh. Hey, Fry!"
7114,BENDER,"So, as Leela was saying, Fry can go shove a big old - Ow!"
7115,FRY,"I'm glad you're all here. I wanted to introduce you to my on-again-off-again girlfriend of the past thousand years, Michelle.  Michelle, this is Leela. This is Bender.  The professor.  Hermes and Amy."
7116,MICHELLE,Nice to meet you.
7117,FRY,And this is Dr. Zoidberg.
7118,HERMES,"Dating you ex, Fry? Have you lost all self-respect?"
7119,FRY,All what?
7120,FARNSWORTH,"This can only end badly, Fry. Kids, a house -"
7121,BENDER,A home invasion by a former roommate.
7122,FRY,"But things are different this time. Before, she was demanding and possessive. But now she wants me to do stuff and stay with her all the time."
7123,ZOIDBERG,"There you go, dearies."
7124,MICHELLE,"It's a relief to meet you, Amy. I'm just having a hard time adjusting to all the strange stuff here in the future."
7125,AMY,I'm from Mars.
7126,MICHELLE,I feel so out of place here. I don't understand why Fry fits in so well.
7127,LEELA,Probably because he didn't fit in back in your time.
7128,MICHELLE,That's true. But I used to fit in really well.
7129,ZOIDBERG,"Then good luck, sister."
7130,MICHELLE,"Don't take this the wrong way, Fry, but your friends are a bunch of freaks."
7131,FRY,"Yeah, they're great, huh?"
7132,MICHELLE,"I just don't belong here. I don't know anyone, I can't find a vanishing cream that doesn't make me actually vanish. I don't even have a job."
7133,FRY,"Oh, right. I was supposed to assign you a job. Let me just get your career chip installed.  Hold out your palm. What are you scared of? It's just like getting your hand pierced."
7134,MICHELLE,"This world is horrible. Let's start over, Fry. Well go someplace where all we have is each other."
7135,FRY,"Ooh, romantic. I'll tell Bender to meet us there."
7136,MICHELLE,"It's not a ""there"". It's a ""then"". The future."
7137,FRY,"Whoa, whoa, girl. I thought you were talking about one of those motels where the bed is shaped like stuff."
7138,MICHELLE,I love you. Don't you love me?
7139,FRY,"Well, sure. To the extent a man can love a woman. But this seems like a big step."
7140,MICHELLE,"Fry, why must you analyse everything with your relentless logic? Nothing matters but our love."
7141,FRY,You're right. Let's do this now and let's never regret it.
7142,FRY,"Michelle, I don't regret this. But I both rue and lament it."
7143,FRY,The year 4000 is severely disappointing. I miss the year 3000 when life was simple and brains flew through space and everyone ate lasers.
7144,MICHELLE,It's not that bad. Fate brought us together and now fate brought us here.
7145,FRY,"No, you brought us here."
7146,MICHELLE,"Whine some more, Fry, I really find that attractive in a man. Now come on, build us a shelter."
7147,FRY,"Alright, fine. Everything else sucks. At least we can have a nice place to live."
7148,FRY,"Ooh, there."
7149,MICHELLE,You expect me to live in a tiny little hole?
7150,FRY,"It'd be deeper, but I'm standing on a gopher."
7151,MICHELLE,"Oh, look. Some little kids."
7152,FRY,They'll save us.  We're saved!
7153,BUTCH,"I'm Butch, leader of this place. I took your hole and you can't do nothing about it."
7154,MICHELLE,
7155,FRY,"Mighty sir, we have nowhere to go. Could we please join your society?"
7156,BUTCH,"Well, alright. But no interfering with our grand works."
7157,FRY,"I tell you, that Butch runs a pretty good civilisation. I think I'll enjoy serving under him."
7158,MICHELLE,"You know your problem, Fry? You're not ambitious. You should be chief."
7159,FRY,"What do I need, ulcers?"
7160,MICHELLE,But I want power. I'm tired of the chief's girlfriend lording it over me with her fancy coyote hide.
7161,FRY,"Alright, alright. If it'll make you happy, I'll overthrow society."
7162,BUTCH,On what grounds do you challenge my authority?
7163,FRY,"Well, I'm older than you. I can beat you up."
7164,KID #1,"Yeah, I'll bet he could."
7165,BUTCH'S GIRLFRIEND,He's got arm hair.
7166,BUTCH,"Alright, grandpa. There's only one way to settle this. Death rolling!"
7167,FRY,What's death rolling?
7168,OROWHEAT,It's like skateboarding.
7169,ICE-V,"Except half the time, someone dies."
7170,FRY,"Oh, so it's a little safer than skateboarding."
7171,BUTCH,Last one holding the bandana's the new leader.
7172,MICHELLE,"My mother always said you were a loser, Fry. Now get out there and prove her wrong."
7173,FRY,(sadly) Beth said that?
7174,BUTCH'S GIRLFRIEND,"(in Hebrew) One, two, three."
7175,BUTCH,It's cool. Back off.  (crying) My knee. I scraped it.
7176,FRY,Aww. Poor little guy. Let me just take a look at - aha!  I won! I'm the new chief! I'm the tallest and I weigh the most!
7177,BUTCH,"Hand it over, you giant idiot."
7178,BUTCH'S GIRLFRIEND,"Hey, Butch, your mom's here."
7179,BUTCH,"Aw, man."
7180,BUTCH'S MOM,"Come on, kids. You're late for Hebrew school."
7181,OROWHEAT,I don't wanna go.
7182,BUTCH'S GIRLFRIEND,Every Monday and Wednesday's the same thing.
7183,FRY,"I find this post-apocalyptic wasteland very confusing. Seriously, I'm weirded out."
7184,MICHELLE,That's because you're a loser. You were a loser in the year 2000 and you're a loser in the year 4000.
7185,FRY,"Yeah, but in the year 3000, I had it all. Several friends, a low-paying job, a bed in a robot's closet. I envied no man. But you wrecked everything."
7186,MICHELLE,"Quit standing up for yourself, Fry. When we get back to the hole, we are going to have a long, boring talk about our relationship!"
7187,FRY,"Oh, yeah? Well, listen to this: (whispering) I'm leaving you."
7188,FRY,There must be people somewhere.
7189,FRY,Yes! Footprints! And hand prints?  But? What's happening?
7190,LEELA,"Fry, thank God we found you."
7191,FRY,Leela? What are you guys doing here in the year 4000?
7192,LEELA,It's not the year 4000.
7193,BENDER,"You were only frozen for two days. Uh, by the way, I broke your bed."
7194,FARNSWORTH,You were in Pauly Shore's tube and they were delivering it to his movie screening.
7195,LEELA,"But, when they noticed you weren't him, they chucked you in a ditch."
7196,FRY,So you're saying these aren't the decaying ruins of New York in the year 4000?
7197,FARNSWORTH,You wish! You're in Los Angeles!
7198,FRY,But there was this gang of 10-year olds with guns.
7199,LEELA,Exactly: You're in L.A.
7200,FRY,But everyone is driving around in cars shooting at each other.
7201,BENDER,That's L.A.. for you.
7202,FRY,But the air's green and there's no sign of civilisation whatsoever.
7203,BENDER,He just won't stop with the social commentary.
7204,FRY,"And the people are all phoneys. No one reads. Everything has cilantro on it -  Michelle, baby!"
7205,MICHELLE,"It's not working out, Fry."
7206,SHORE,"(shouting) Tis better to have loved and lost, n'est ce-pas?"
7207,FRY,"That's it. I've had it with women. From now on, I'm concentrating on my career. Can I have my old job back?"
7208,FARNSWORTH,"Why, I've forgotten why I even fired you."
7209,BENDER,"'Cause he destroyed your business, your home and all your possessions."
7210,FARNSWORTH,"Oh, that's right. Get lost."
7211,THE END,
7212,"""PARASITES LOST""",
7213,MAN #1 [ON RADIO],"Breaker breaker, this is the Duck. Uh, you wanna back off them hogs?"
7214,MAN #1 [ON RADIO],"Ten-four, five miles or so."
7215,MAN #2 [ON RADIO],"Ten, roger!"
7216,LEELA,"Hmm, I'd better check the fluid levels. (shouting) We're OK on Coke syrup."
7217,BENDER,"Oh man, come on!  Comin' through!"
7218,BENDER,What's that black cracker?
7219,FRY,A tomato.
7220,LEELA,You're not gonna eat a sandwich from a truck stop men's room are you?
7221,FRY,"Eh, what's the worst thing that could happen?  Ugh, it's like there's a party in my mouth and everyone's throwing up!"
7222,TRUCKER #1,Looky there! It's one of them things like on our mudflaps!
7223,TRUCKER #2,Yosemite Sam?
7224,SAL,Stands back! I'm gonna puts my moves on her.  Whoas!
7225,FRY,That jerk! No one hoots at my captain unless they're prepared to take it to the next level!
7226,LEELA,Fry please. That's sweet but I'd rather not even dignify them with an ass whooping!
7227,SAL,Hey sexy mama! Let's get busy and freaky in that order!
7228,FRY,Hey jumbo! How would you like it if Leela said you were sexy and she wanted to make love with you?
7229,SAL,"Eh, I gots five minutes. She looks pretty good for a truck stop chick!"
7230,FRY,You take that back! She does not look good for a truck stop chick!
7231,SAL,Yeah you're right. She don't gots enough meat for a guy like me.
7232,FRY,She does too! She's loaded with meat! She's got more meat than a cow!  Ow!
7233,SAL (LAUGHING),More meat than a cow!
7234,FRY,I can't please Leela no matter what I do! I just want her to like me.
7235,BENDER,Well there's always hope.  C'mon we gotta go fix the plasma fusion boiler.
7236,BENDER,Who are you?
7237,SCRUFFY,Scruffy. The janitor.
7238,BENDER,Well why aren't you fixing the boiler?
7239,SCRUFFY,Schedule conflict.
7240,BENDER,There. Fixed forever.
7241,SCRUFFY,Scruffy's gonna die the way he lived. Oh marmalade!
7242,ZOIDBERG,Oh the hypochondriac's back. So what is it this time?
7243,FRY,Well my lead pipe hurts a little?
7244,ZOIDBERG,That's normal. Next patient.
7245,BENDER,He's a witch!
7246,FARNSWORTH,"Fry, did you eat anything unusual recently?"
7247,FRY,No.
7248,LEELA,What about that bathroom egg salad from the truck stop?
7249,FRY,I've had better.
7250,FARNSWORTH,"Egg salad? Hmm. Zoidberg will have to examine your gastrointestinal tract. Come everyone, give Fry some privacy."
7251,FARNSWORTH,"If you can't see well enough through the two-way mirror, there'll be a close-up on this video screen."
7252,ZOIDBERG,Hmm. We'll need to have a look inside you with this camera.  Guess again.
7253,AMY,Gross!
7254,FARNSWORTH,Watch for any subtle irregularity in Fry's bowel.
7255,AMY,It's gorgeous. That place used to be a big dump.
7256,BENDER,"Oh, eww!"
7257,AMY,Worms? Eww! Puke-a-tronic!
7258,LEELA,So the eggs in that egg salad sandwich were -
7259,FARNSWORTH,Correct! Worm eggs! And the mayonaise was probably none too fresh either.
7260,HERMES,It's nauseating man!  Is there no way to get rid of the disgusting maggots?
7261,FARNSWORTH,"Only one. We'll have to travel deep inside Fry, in this!"
7262,BENDER,Shotgun!
7263,FARNSWORTH,"In each gastro-survival kit, you'll find a rain slicker, a disposable fun camera, and something to protect you against bacteria.... - a harpoon!"
7264,BENDER,"Yo, old guy. Why do we have to use those tiny micro-droids? Can't you just shrink us?"
7265,FARNSWORTH,Oh my no. That would require extrememly tiny atoms. And have you priced those lately? I'm not made of money - leave me alone!
7266,ZOIDBERG,Me next!
7267,FARNSWORTH,"Anyhoo, your net suits will let you experience Fry's worm-infested bowels as if you were actually wriggling through them."
7268,ZOIDBERG,There's no part of that sentence I didn't like.
7269,FARNSWORTH,Is everyone present?
7270,AMY,Right on!
7271,BENDER,Uh-huh.
7272,HERMES,Definately.
7273,ZOIDBERG,Yes.
7274,FARNSWORTH,"Heres the plan:  We'll enter the ear, drip down the back of the throat and make for the bowel. There, we'll irritate the pelvic splachnic ganglion and cause an intestinal spasm, expelling - among other things - the parasites."
7275,BENDER,I'll tell Fry to wash out - among other things - his ear.
7276,FARNSWORTH,"No, Fry can't know anything about the mission. If he finds out, the worms will try to defend themselves. They know everything he knows."
7277,BENDER,They know how to make ice cream soup?
7278,FARNSWORTH,"Leela, your role is to distract Fry so he doesn't notice what we're up to."
7279,LEELA (ECHOING),Can do!
7280,AMY,"Leela, you should really try a facial scrubs, for your pores."
7281,LEELA,Look! A starling!
7282,FRY [LOOKING AWAY],Really?
7283,AMY (WHISPERING),OK Professor.
7284,FRY,What about what?
7285,LEELA,"Uh...what if we go for a walk possibly because it's such a lovely day, perhaps."
7286,FRY,I'd love to!
7287,HERMES,We gotta get someplace where he won't stick his finger!
7288,BENDER,It's hopeless! Abandon ship!
7289,FARNSWORTH,"Wait, we just have to get past the eardrum!"
7290,HERMES [FROM SHIP],What are those worms doing to Fry's brain?
7291,HERMES [FROM SHIP],My God! Soon he'll be smarter than Cher!
7292,FRY,"Ah, the scent of a rose. Curious how an aromatic chain of hydrocarbons can evoke our deepest emotions.  For you."
7293,LEELA,That's such a beautiful thought Fry. And what's more amazing you expressed it without spewing crumbs at me!
7294,FARNSWORTH,Brace yourselves everyone. We're entering the interior of Fry's nose!
7295,BENDER,We're at finger alert five.
7296,FARNSWORTH,Let's just pray nothing stimulates the delicate smell receptors. (whispering) Nobody make a smell.
7297,ZOIDBERG,Quick! We can escape through that nasal capillary into the sinus.
7298,HERMES,Strange. Usually you don't know anything about human anatomy.
7299,ZOIDBERG,"I learned it from a decongestant commercial. (echoing) ""Soothing action, action, action action..."""
7300,BENDER,"Where are we, the ass?"
7301,FARNSWORTH,"We're in the heart. Better known as ""the love muscle."""
7302,ZOIDBERG,Where the food is digested.
7303,FARNSWORTH,"We should be safe, just so long as nothing makes it beat faster."
7304,BENDER,Abandon ship!
7305,FARNSWORTH,No! Set course for that cholesterol-encrusted valve.
7306,ZOIDBERG,It's good cholesterol but it spreads like bad cholesterol!
7307,AMY [FROM SHIP],Look! They're jazzercising Fry's muscles!
7308,HERMES,He'll be as strong and flexible as Gumbo and Hercules combined!
7309,ZOIDBERG,Gumbercules? I love that guy!
7310,LEELA,Ugh! It's that jerk from the truck stop! Let's cross the street and try to blend in with that crowd of pimps.
7311,FRY,"I don't think so.  Sir, I believe you owe this lady an apology."
7312,LEELA,Fry no! He's bulging with what could be muscles!  Ooo!
7313,SAL,I gots your apologys right heres!  Sorrys ma'am. I've learnsed a lesson about not ogling cans that I won't soons forgets.
7314,BENDER,Abandon ship!
7315,FARNSWORTH,"No, don't give up now! we're but a stones throw from the pyloric sphinchter."
7316,BENDER [FROM SHIP],Hooray!
7317,ZOIDBERG [FROM SHIP],Hooray!
7318,HERMES [FROM SHIP],We made it!
7319,FARNSWORTH,There it is! The stately capitol of Fry's bowel. A heavily guarded fortress surrounding the pelvic splachnic ganglion.
7320,ZOIDBERG,"I've heard of that, who said I haven't?!"
7321,FARNSWORTH,"If we can stimulate that nerve, the bowel will convulse, expelling the entire worm society."
7322,HERMES,But what about the worms in the other parts of his body?
7323,FARNSWORTH,"Listen, this is gonna be one hell of a bowel movement. Afterwards he'll be lucky if he has any bones left!"
7324,BENDER,"All right, let's mush some worms!"
7325,WORM MAYOR,Worms to battlestations!
7326,LEELA,"I had a great time today. The flowers, the puddle, the way you hurt that guy. But can I ax you something?"
7327,FRY,Anything.
7328,LEELA,Why did you do all that stuff?
7329,FRY,"Leela, there's something I've wanted to tell you for a long time but every time I try I get nervous and my mouth feels like it's stuffed with peanut butter, even when it's not."
7330,LEELA,What is it? Is it about Bender?
7331,FRY,"No, it's about you and me."
7332,LEELA,And Bender?
7333,FRY,Bender's not involved.  Leela...I love you.
7334,LEELA,You do?
7335,FRY,Yes. But it's only recently I've been able to articulate my thoughts. I love you Leela and I always have.
7336,LEELA,"Fry, that's the sweetest, most wonderful - wait! Recently? Like since you ate that toilet sandwich?"
7337,FRY,Yeah! I don't know why but my life really turned around that day!
7338,LEELA,Stay here.
7339,WAITRESS,Freshen your nocatina?
7340,FRY,Please......I need something to settle my stomach.
7341,FARNSWORTH,The nerve is through here. Where's Zoidberg?
7342,ZOIDBERG,Yippie-ki-yay! You'll never guess where I've been!
7343,FARNSWORTH,There it is! The pelvic splachnic ganglion. Tickle it and get ready for the ride of your lives!
7344,LEELA,Don't even think about tickling that ganglion!
7345,FARNSWORTH,"Leela, you're just in time to help. If we don't get rid of the worms now, they'll burrow so deep into the bowel that not even Hermes' famous jerk prunes could dislodge them!"
7346,HERMES,"I call it ""Carribean Drain-o""!"
7347,FARNSWORTH,Fry will be stuck with the worms forever.
7348,LEELA,Perfect.
7349,ZOIDBERG,Ouch!
7350,AMY,I'm OK.
7351,FARNSWORTH,Leela you ignorant dope! Now the worms will be in Fry forever.
7352,LEELA,So? Did you ever stop to think that Fry is better off with worms?
7353,FARNSWORTH,Oh that's stupid!
7354,FRY,"If anyone wants to tell me what's going on here, I'll be in the lounge."
7355,FRY,"Of all the parasites I've had over the years, these worms are among the - hell! They are the best! Leela, how can I ever repay you for saving them?"
7356,LEELA (SEXFULLY),I'll think of something.
7357,BENDER,'Ello! What's all this then?
7358,FRY,Apartment 1I. The old me would have made a joke about that!
7359,LEELA,I'm thinking of having a window installed.
7360,FRY,I think the view's perfect already.
7361,LEELA,"Oh, that's the corniest thing I've ever heard! Let me show you the bedroom."
7362,FRY,Wait. In a minute.
7363,LEELA,A holophonor? Only a few people in the whole universe can play that. And they're not very good at it.
7364,FRY,They don't have you to inspire them.
7365,LEELA,I don't have words to say how wonderful you are Fry. I haven't felt this happy since double-soup Tuesday at the orphanarium.
7366,FRY,"When I'm with you, everyday seems like double-soup Tuesday."
7367,LEELA,"Oh Fry, I love what you've become."
7368,FRY,What I've become.
7369,LEELA,What is it?
7370,FRY,There's just something I have to find out.
7371,FRY,Who controls this bowel?
7372,WORM GUARD #1,Who wants to know?
7373,WORM MAYOR,I am the Lord Mayor of Cologne.
7374,FRY,You mean colon?
7375,WORM MAYOR,State your business!
7376,FRY,"Your excellency, have you ever been in love?"
7377,WORM MAYOR,No. I thought I was once but then I remember our species reproduces with a cloud of spores.
7378,FRY,"Well, a wonderful girl loves me. But I need to know if it's really me she loves, or just what you worms have made of me. That's why with all due respect, I'm asking you to leave."
7379,WORM MAYOR,"Listen you, I was born here. I raised a cloud of children here. My ancestors came over here on the sandwich.  No one can make me leave!"
7380,FRY,Everyone out of my body or the brain gets it!
7381,WORM MAYOR,He's bluffing. No creature would willingly make an idiot out of itself.
7382,FRY,"Obviously you've never been in love! Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Now, the hand-eye co-ordination lobe."
7383,WORM GUARD #1,Stop it man!
7384,WORM MAYOR,"You've damaged your brain Universe, but no more than a week of binge drinking or five minutes on a cell phone."
7385,FRY,"I was just working my way towards the medulla oblongata - control centre of the heart and lungs. And if I kill myself, you die with me."
7386,WORM GUARD #2,Wait a minute man!
7387,FRY,"I hope Satan has a nice colon, 'cause that's where you're gonna be living!"
7388,WORM MAYOR,Stop! We'll leave.  But one day you'll be eating a fast-food burger and boom! You'll be crawling with us again! Ever wonder what makes special sauce so special? Yo!
7389,LEELA,Fry? I missed you. Did you find out what you needed to find out?
7390,FRY,"I'm about to.  Leela, let me play for you one for time."
7391,LEELA,You don't have to do that. I'm still seduced from before.
7392,FRY,"Please, it's important to me."
7393,LEELA,What's that supposed to mean?
7394,FRY,I don't know. I got nervous and started thinking about neck bolts.  Wow! Did you see that vase break? It was all like -
7395,LEELA,What's happened to you?
7396,FRY,Nothing. I got rid of the worms.
7397,LEELA,What? Why would you do that?
7398,FRY,"Leela, I had worms. I needed to know who you loved. Me or them."
7399,LEELA,Well...which of you wrote me that sonnet?
7400,FRY,"I did. I think. It was probably about 50/50. But that's how I really felt about you, I swear!"
7401,LEELA,I don't know.
7402,FRY,"Please. Give me a chance to be romantic on my own. I've got a baggy of massage oil, and I'm gonna give you my super back rub, just like a I used to give Amy when I was going out with her, and she always seemed... - Uh-oh!"
7403,BENDER,"Sorry you struck out sausage link. If it's any consolation, my life is great! Babes! Bucks! I got it all!"
7404,FRY,"Well, at least I learned Leela's a lost cause. I give up."
7405,BENDER,There you go!  Goodnight. I gotta get up early to go parasailing with movie stars!
7406,THE END,
7407,"""AMAZON WOMEN IN THE MOOD""",
7408,HERMES,"People, we got a problem: Little Nibbler's been coughing up hairballs."
7409,LEELA,"Well, so has Fry. What's the big deal?"
7410,FRY,He's got me beat!
7411,HERMES,"Now well all love Nibbler, so it's only fair that we all pitch in and clean it up together. Still, I propose we make Zoidberg do it. All in favour?"
7412,LEELA,Yeah!
7413,BENDER,"Alright, yup."
7414,HERMES,All opposed?  All abstaining?
7415,LEELA,Dr. Zoidberg? Are you OK?
7416,FRY,He's dead.
7417,BENDER,What?
7418,AMY,Oh no!
7419,FARNSWORTH,"He always seemed so full of life. Laughing, singing, begging for scraps. And now this."
7420,ZOIDBERG,Why with all the crying?  So that's where I left my shell.
7421,LEELA,I didn't know you could take this thing off.
7422,ZOIDBERG,"It was starting to get a little cramped in there so I molted, why not? Ah, the fresh air feels good!"
7423,FARNSWORTH,Stop doing that!
7424,ZOIDBERG,So long. I'm off to toss this old shell in the dumpster and maybe pick up those potato chips Amy didn't finish yesterday.
7425,AMY,Those were toenail clippings.
7426,ZOIDBERG,A feast is a feast.
7427,AMY,"Hey, that's my cellphone!"
7428,AMY,Hello?  Hello? Who is this?  Hello? Hello?
7429,LEELA,What's wrong? Did you swallow your phone again?
7430,AMY,Some guy's been calling and hanging up 10 times a day for a year.
7431,LEELA,Men who call too much are the worst ... I bet.
7432,AMY,I just wish a decent guy would call me instead of this spleeze-ball who has me too terrified to even answer the phone.  Hello?
7433,AMY,Hello? Is anyone there?
7434,KIF,I love you.  Why must I be such a coward?
7435,ZAPP,"Kif, I'm headed to the men's room and I'll be needing an attendant so-- Oh, I'm sorry. You're crying like a woman. It's alright. I've always thought myself as a father figure to some of my more pathetic men. Kif, old friend, let's rap."
7436,KIF,"Well, I'm in love with this girl--"
7437,ZAPP,"(laughing) Oh, that's rich! (talking) Go on."
7438,KIF,I met her a year ago...
7439,KIF,(voice-over) ...when we were escaping from that cruise ship you piloted directly into a black hole.
7440,ZAPP,(voice-over; proud) Yes! It was in all the papers.
7441,AMY,Call me.
7442,ZAPP,"Uh-huh, uh-huh. Mm-hmm, uh-huh."
7443,KIF,"I've finished talking, sir."
7444,ZAPP,Belay that remark!  Your Amy knows my Leela? I have formed an idea!
7445,ZAPP,"I'm calling to negotiate a double date. You and me, Kif and Amy."
7446,LEELA,Forget it.
7447,ZAPP,Then let the negotiations begin. I propose we go out on 10 dates.
7448,LEELA,How about zero?
7449,ZAPP,Nine.
7450,LEELA,Zero.
7451,ZAPP,Seven.
7452,LEELA,Zero.
7453,ZAPP,Eight?
7454,AMY,"(whispering) Please, Leela? Kif's like the sweetest guy who's ever liked me."
7455,ZAPP,"Five, and that's my final offer ... four."
7456,LEELA,One.
7457,ZAPP,Two.
7458,LEELA,One half.
7459,ZAPP,I'll take it.
7460,ZAPP,We'll meet you tonight for part of dinner and the first half of a movie.
7461,KIF,"Um, sir? I don't go out on many dates and, um, what if I can't think of anything to say?"
7462,ZAPP,Here's my personal book of pickup lines. Say as many of them as you can as fast as you can. Don't stop for any reason.
7463,KIF,Maybe I'll just give her these flowers.
7464,ZAPP,"Wrong, wrong, wrong! And what's that? Candy? Candy's for dorks! Give me that. Mmm!"
7465,ZAPP,"Hello, beautiful. I got these for you."
7466,LEELA,Thanks.
7467,ZAPP,"Well, well. This looks to be one disturbingly erotic date."
7468,LEELA,Half-date.
7469,ZAPP,"Waiter, bring us a bottle of wine."
7470,LEELA,Half-bottle.
7471,ZAPP,And some oysters on the half-shell.
7472,LEELA,Quarter-shell.
7473,KIF,"Oh, and I'd like--"
7474,ZAPP,"Kif's not hungry. (quietly) Kif, this place is expensive. (talking) I'd like two steaks and the ladies will have some very sensual salads -- with low-cal sensual dressing."
7475,MORBO,"(singing) Oh, won't you take me to funkytown,"
7476,AMY,"Kif, you're so quiet. You haven't said a word all night."
7477,KIF,"Well, um, um ... hello."
7478,AMY,'Cause I was really hoping we could talk and stuff.
7479,KIF,"Amy, (reading) if I said you had a beautiful body would you take your pants off and dance around a little?"
7480,AMY,What?!
7481,LEELA,Lieutenant Kroker!
7482,KIF,(reading) I find the most erotic part of the woman is the boobies
7483,AMY,Kif!
7484,KIF,"Oh, my!"
7485,LEELA,This half-date is entirely over. Amy? Conference!
7486,KIF,"Is there nothing we can do, sir?"
7487,ZAPP,"There's only one sure-fire way back into a woman's heart and parts beyond. I speak of course, of kareoke."
7488,KIF,(determined) My years in the DOOP Boys' Chorus will not have been in vain!
7489,LEELA,"Alright, enough lipstick. Let's storm out."
7490,KIF,"(singing) Once upon a time I was falling in love,"
7491,AMY,"Oh, that's so emotional!"
7492,KIF,"(singing) ...There's nothing I can do,"
7493,ZAPP,"Amateur hour's over.  Let me show you why they call me ""The Velour Fog""! Hit it!"
7494,MAN,"Aw, give us a break!"
7495,WOMAN,Get off!
7496,CHEF,He sickens me!
7497,ZAPP,"(spoken-word) She walked up to me and she asked me to dance,"
7498,LEELA,We're going home. Call us a space taxi.
7499,ZAPP,"No need. There's not a restaurant built I can't fly. Where to, ladies?"
7500,KIF,"Please, sir. Let's just divide up the check and--"
7501,ZAPP,Let's see what this eatery can do.
7502,ZAPP,"Ah, she's built like a steakhouse, but she handles like a bistro.  She's out of control!"
7503,ZAPP,"(from inside) You win again, gravity!"
7504,ZOIDBERG,"Look what arrived: My new shell catalogue. So let's try some on already!  Ah! Muy macho! Hey, gringos! Here comes El Zoido to ruin your drinking water!"
7505,BENDER,"Whoa, whoa, whoa! I'm Mexican and I find that offensive."
7506,ZOIDBERG,You Latins are so hot-blooded!  This one's like a summer guy!
7507,HERMES,"Look, you fat fish. The Planet Express health plan only covers one kind of replacement shell."
7508,FRY,I can't believe Leela and Amy aren't back yet from their half-date. I'm gonna call the restaurant.
7509,OPERATOR,The number you have dialled has crashed into a planet. Please make a note of it.
7510,FRY,We gotta go rescue them!
7511,BENDER,"Eh, I don't know."
7512,FRY,Bender! Think of the señoritas!
7513,BENDER,Vámonos!
7514,KIF,"So, Amy, um, well--"
7515,AMY,It's always a line with you!
7516,LEELA,What planet is this anyway?
7517,ZAPP,(mumbling) I 'unno. (talking) This whole sector is uncharted.
7518,KIF,"It is not uncharted, you lost the chart!"
7519,ZAPP,"Well, nothing to do now but repopulate the human race.  Just me and you!  (whispering) And maybe you."
7520,AMY,What is it?
7521,KUG,Me hear people. But me not see people.
7522,THOG,No big deal. Everybody make mistake.
7523,ZAPP,"Well, hello! I usually don't say this but you are the most beautiful trio of gigantic ladies I've ever laid eyes on.  (reading) I find the most erotic part of a woman is the boo--"
7524,FRY,"Oh, no! Any sign of Leela or Amy?"
7525,BENDER,No. But what do you make of this?
7526,FRY,I don't know. But it might have something to do with this.
7527,BENDER,"Oh, your God!"
7528,KUG,Move! Go!
7529,FRY,"Alright, here's the plan--"
7530,BENDER,What kind of moronic plan is that? Wow!
7531,THOG,Women go free. Men stay in chains.
7532,ORNIK,We take them to our leader. She know what do.
7533,FRY,Pfft. A female leader?
7534,LEELA,"Fry, shut up."
7535,FRY,"Yes, captain!"
7536,THOG,This capital city planet Amazonia.
7537,LEELA,Where are all the men in your society?
7538,ORNIK,Men die out many year ago.
7539,BENDER,"With all these women around they were probably nagged to death. Are you with me, fellas?"
7540,THOG,"Here stadium, where our women basketball teams play."
7541,KUG,"We no can dunk, but good fundamentals."
7542,ORNIK,That more fun to watch.
7543,ZAPP,"(laughing) Oh, God, you're killing me! Ow! God, you're killing me!"
7544,THOG,This our comedy club. Humour here funny in different way.
7545,ORNIK,It not reinforce stereotypes.
7546,KUG,"Comedy come from character, real situations. Not abstract craziness."
7547,BENDER,Translation: Boring!  (laughing) That's a good one!  Ow!
7548,AMY,This women-only planet is sounding better and better.
7549,LEELA,I'm already looking for apartments.
7550,THOG,"Here live vengeful, all-knowing leader. She decide men's fate."
7551,FRY,Is she hot?
7552,THOG,That not important. She all-knowing.
7553,FRY,"In other words, ""No"".  Ow!"
7554,THOG,(chanting) All hail Femputer.
7555,KUG AND ORNIK,(chanting) All hail Femputer.
7556,AMY,You all obey a big computer?
7557,KUG,Yes. It appear mysteriously just about time men die out.
7558,LEELA,So why did you make it your leader?
7559,ORNIK,It seemed like different kind of politician.
7560,KUG,Not beltway insider.
7561,THOG,"Femputer, we bring offering of bath beads and scented soaps."
7562,FEMPUTER,Your gift pleases Femputer. Femputer demands to know why there are men on her planet.
7563,FRY,"It was an accident, ma'am."
7564,FEMPUTER,That does not fempute. Femputer will return after deciding your punishment.
7565,FRY,"Leela, I'm through making fun of women. Now I want them to help me."
7566,AMY,Should we do something?
7567,LEELA,There's no hurry.
7568,ZAPP,Yes! A little tighter.  Tighter. Perhaps a hard spanking is in order?  Too hard!
7569,KUG,Men strange. You have them on your planet?
7570,LEELA,(ashamed) I'm afraid so.
7571,KUG,"What they for?  Oh, you mean ""snu-snu""."
7572,THOG,We hear tell men used for snu-snu. But all we have go on are ancient legend and subscription to Cosmo.
7573,ZAPP,"Just FYI, I could be used for snu-snu."
7574,THOG,Silence. You want die like last men visit Amazonia?
7575,FRY,What'd they die of?
7576,KUG,Crushed pelvises.
7577,FRY,Yes!
7578,ZAPP,"Oh, thank you, Lord in heaven!"
7579,FEMPUTER,"After lengthy femputations, I, Femputer, have decided the fate of the men. Femputer sentences them to death.  By snu-snu!"
7580,FRY,(cheering) Yay!
7581,ZAPP,"(cheering) Yeah!  (talking) What are you, gay?"
7582,FEMPUTER,Death to the men. Death by snu-snu.
7583,FRY,Although the snu-snu part's gonna be pretty good.
7584,ZAPP,"Baby, it'll blow your mind."
7585,LEELA,"Femputer, be reasonable. Sure men are annoying and they wreck up whatever planet they're in charge of. But most of these men are sorta my friends. They don't deserve to die."
7586,FEMPUTER,Hmm. Perhaps men are not as evil as Femputer thinks.
7587,THOG,But they make fun women's basketball.
7588,FEMPUTER,What?! Did you explain how the women's good fundamentals make up for their inability to dunk?
7589,ORNIK,Yes. They still laugh.
7590,FEMPUTER,The men must die.
7591,BENDER,"Too true, Femputer. You're so wise. Kill 'em all, I say. Good riddance! Did I mention I'm not a man? I'm a manbot. It's an understandable mistake. You can let me down now, thanks."
7592,KUG,He big jerk like man.
7593,BENDER,I sure am. But check the crotch.  Nothing.
7594,FEMPUTER,"Very well, release him. As for the others, take them to the snu-snu chambers."
7595,BENDER,"(crying) I'll miss you, meatbag."
7596,LEELA,"Me too, meatbag."
7597,FRY,"Goodbye, friends. I never thought I would die like this. But I'd always really hoped."
7598,AMAZONIANS,"(chanting) Snu-snu, snu-snu, snu-snu!"
7599,KIF,"Amy. Before I die, I have to tell you: I didn't mean to say those awful things on our date. They were all Zapp's idea."
7600,AMY,Really? Honest and true?
7601,KIF,"Yes. And-And that person calling and hanging up, was me. I was just too nervous to say hello because I love you."
7602,AMY,"Oh, Kif!"
7603,THOG,It Thog's first time.  Be gentle!
7604,LEELA,"We've got to do something. Bender, maybe you can interface with the Femputer and reprogram it to let them go."
7605,BENDER,"Maybe you can interface with my ass. By biting it!  Alright, I'll go!"
7606,FRY,(from inside) Ooh! Yeah!
7607,ZAPP,"(from inside) Oh, baby!"
7608,GUARD #1,How Tonk look?
7609,GUARD #2,Tonk look good. Me fat.
7610,GUARD #1,"No, you look good. Tonk fat."
7611,FEMPUTER,Intruder! Stay away from the mighty Femputer! Guards!
7612,BENDER,Time to override the CPU and reprogram this Femputer.
7613,FEMPUTER,"Hey, whoa, whoa! Stop it! Stop it! Hey, cut that out!"
7614,FEMBOT,Cease hitting Femputer!
7615,BENDER,"You're no Femputer, you're a Fembot!"
7616,FEMBOT,(ashamed) It's true. I disguised myself as a Femputer so I could rule the Amazonians.
7617,BENDER,But why?
7618,FEMBOT,Why? Why? I came here from a faraway planet. A planet ruled by a chauvinistic Manputer that was really a Manbot. Have you any idea how it feels to be a Fembot living in a Manbot's Manputer's world?
7619,BENDER,What?
7620,FEMBOT,"And now, my meddling Manbot, there's the question of what to do with you!"
7621,ZAPP,(gasping) We need rest. The spirit is willing but the flesh is spongy and bruised.
7622,ORNIK,It time snu-snu!
7623,FRY,Can't we just cuddle?  (screaming) Nooo!
7624,LEELA,"We can't wait for Bender. It's time for a woman's touch.  Yah! Hi-yah! Yah, yah yah!"
7625,AMY,"(disguised, deeper voice) Me next snu-snu. Out me way."
7626,THOG,Where go beautiful man?  Me want snu-snu!
7627,AMY,Kif! Jump!
7628,KIF,My hero!
7629,THOG,(shouting) Me not get snu-snu! Get him!
7630,THOG,Mighty Femputer. Small girl steal green kissy man. We kill her now?
7631,FEMBOT,(from inside) Come back later. Leave me alone.
7632,BENDER,"(from inside) Yeah, get lost!  (spookily) Ooh! I'm a scary Femputer. Release the prisoners!  (from inside) And bring gold. Lots of gold."
7633,THOG,Gold? Why Femputer want gold?
7634,FEMBOT,(from inside) You heard the man.
7635,BENDER,(from inside) C'mon! Gimmie some of that!
7636,ZOIDBERG,"And that's how I got my new shell. It looks just like the shell I threw out yesterday and I found it in the same dumpster, but this one had a live raccoon inside.  Pretty good story, eh, Hermes?"
7637,HERMES,"Stick to someone else, you windy barnacle¬"
7638,LEELA,It's funny how the battle of the sexes was only resolved when a Manbot and a Fembot realised they loved each other.
7639,BENDER,"Yeah. By the way, if she calls, I'm not here. All I know is this gold says that was the best mission ever!"
7640,AMY,It sure was.
7641,FRY,"Oh, yeah!"
7642,ZAPP,I had snu-snu!
7643,KIF,"So, um, Amy, w-what do you wanna do now?"
7644,THE END,
7645,"""BENDLESS LOVE""",
7646,LEELA,Guidance system?
7647,BENDER,Online.
7648,LEELA,Autopilot?
7649,AUTOPILOT,Present.
7650,LEELA,Dark matter indicator?
7651,FRY,Making the noise.
7652,LEELA,All systems operational. Let's rock!
7653,LEELA,"Gentlemen, I've completed my report on the crash."
7654,BENDER,Whoa! I'm not reading that crap. Summarise it in one word.
7655,LEELA,"Sabotage.  This is a normal L-unit. Without it, space travel is but the fevered dream of a madman."
7656,FRY,Yep.
7657,BENDER,Of course.
7658,ZOIDBERG,Doy!
7659,HERMES,It's an important unit.
7660,LEELA,"And this, my friends, is the L-unit I just removed from the ship."
7661,FRY,"That doesn't look like an ""L"" at all. Unless you count lowercase."
7662,BENDER,You know we don't!
7663,LEELA,Whoever did this was strong. This is 340 pounds of Tonka-tough steel.
7664,BENDER,Hmm. It should look like this.  But instead it looks like this.
7665,FRY,Who would do a thing like that?
7666,BENDER,"Who could do a thing like that? And by ""that"", I mean this."
7667,ZOIDBERG,"Well, gang, it looks like we have another mystery on our hands."
7668,HERMES,I'd better make a chart of the suspects. I'll begin by drawing a line with my straight-edge.  Sweet lampre of Santa Fe! My edge has been bent!
7669,AMY,(crying) My javelin too! It's ruined. Now we'll never beat Jupiter State.
7670,ZOIDBERG,"My slinky!  My cuddly, little pet slinky!"
7671,FARNSWORTH,What's all the hubbub?
7672,LEELA,My God! Even the Professor's been bent.
7673,FARNSWORTH,"That you for your sympathy, talking square of linoleum."
7674,BENDER,I'll get you fixed up.  That's fine.
7675,AMY,Wait a minute. Bender? What did you just do to the Professor?
7676,BENDER,I bent him.
7677,AMY,Aha!
7678,HERMES,Bender!
7679,ZOIDBERG,J'accuse!
7680,BENDER,"Oh, I see. A bunch of stuff gets bent so it must be the robot designed for bending."
7681,HERMES,I know how to settle this: We'll check last night's surveillance tapes.
7682,FRY,Huh?
7683,AMY,What tapes?
7684,LEELA,Surveillance?
7685,ZOIDBERG,You've seen me naked?
7686,HERMES,Ah. Last night's tape. It was right next to Bathroom Bloopers 4.
7687,BENDER,"See? Nothing. Told you, losers."
7688,FRY,Wait! There on the screen. It's that guy you are.
7689,BENDER,I'm sleepwalking.
7690,FARNSWORTH,Dear God! We've got robots on the ceiling.
7691,FRY,You weren't sleepwalking. You were sleep-bending!
7692,BENDER,"This is quite a shock. On the other hand, it's not surprising in the least. After all, I've been bending since the day I was built."
7693,BENDER,(voice-over) I was born on an assembly line in the bad part of Tijuana.
7694,BENDER,"Mama.  Hooray! I graduated! Time to bend around Europe for a few months, then get a job bending."
7695,AMY,You remember your own birth?
7696,BENDER,Sure. It was only four years ago.
7697,FRY,You're only four years old?
7698,BENDER,"Precocious little scamp, ain't I?"
7699,LEELA,Hmm. Bender must have a pent-up need to bend that's not being satisfied by his bend-free lifestyle.
7700,FARNSWORTH,Then he can't stay here. He's a menace to every straight person in the company. Go satisfy your bend lust and don't you come back to work until you do.
7701,ROBOTS,"(chanting) No more bending, no more work. Give us a raise, you big fat jerk."
7702,SAL,(shouting) Nevers!
7703,JOEY,Yo! The Mafia supports you. But don't tell no one. Spread the word.
7704,DONBOT,"As the duly-elected mobsters of this union, it's our duty to support the struggle of these proud, lazy slobs."
7705,JOEY,"Yeah, but what if management remains intragnizent?"
7706,DONBOT,"From the context it is clear what you mean. In that case, Clamps may have a little surprise for them."
7707,CLAMPS,The clamps!  (unsure) Right?
7708,BENDER,"Aw, no! A strike? Now I'll never get to bend anything. Oh, woe is Bender."
7709,ROBOT #1,"Hang tough, brother. Management refused our demand to switch casual Friday to Monday."
7710,BENDER,What?!
7711,ROBOT #2,And now they're hiring scabs at ten- times the normal wage.
7712,BENDER,Ten-times normal wage?  I'll give those jerks what for!
7713,SAL,"Welcomes aboard, scab."
7714,BENDER,Great to be here.
7715,SAL,Come on. I'll introduces you to your scab co-workers you'll be scabbing with. This heres our scab foreman.
7716,BENDER,Flexo?
7717,FLEXO,Bender?
7718,BENDER,"Hey, sorry you got sent to that South American Turkish prison instead of me on account of mistaken identity."
7719,FLEXO,"You bastard! They treated me like an animal and that's what I became!  Nah, you're alright. Good to see you, buddy!"
7720,SAL,And heres another scab what also works here: Angleyne.
7721,BENDER,(sexfully) Hello.
7722,SAL,"Hey, yous guyses wanna move that things?"
7723,BENDER,(more sexfully) Hello!
7724,ROBOTS,(chanting) Give us a raise you big fat jerk.
7725,SAL,(from outside) Nevers!
7726,BENDER,"Ow!  Um. Hi, Angleyne. Whatcha up to?"
7727,ANGLEYNE,Making hangers. Guidance counsellor said I had a knack for it.
7728,BENDER,"That's cool, that's cool. So, um, uh, I was wondering if, y'know, it's cool if not, but, what are you doing after work?"
7729,ANGLEYNE,What I always do. Jack squat.
7730,BENDER,"Me too.  Man, we have a lot in common, huh?"
7731,ANGLEYNE,Well we are made of virtually identical components.
7732,BENDER,(sexfully) Are you sure? Maybe I should sneak a peek at your access panel.
7733,ANGLEYNE,"Hey, according to the scab handbook that's extremely inappropriate banter. (sexfully) And that's just the way I like it."
7734,HERMES,Haile H. Selassie!
7735,ZOIDBERG,"There, little friend. Good as new."
7736,FARNSWORTH,"What an exquisite day. That azure sky, the verdant treetops.  Those delightful birds with their chirp, chirp, chirp and their tweet, tweet, splat."
7737,FRY,"Professor, I've never seen you so cheerful. What the hell's wrong with you?"
7738,FARNSWORTH,"Hmm. I'm not quite sure. Perhaps seeing things from a new perspective has reminded me of life's beauty. Or perhaps my new posture is causing blood to pool in the back of my brain, resulting in a mild delirium. Incidentally, you have a dime up your nose."
7739,FRY,I wish! It's a nickel.
7740,BENDER,Union forever! Lousy scabs! They can't do those things! Et cetera!
7741,BENDER,I bet watching me bend girders like this turns your legs all rubbery.
7742,ANGLEYNE,"Well my legs are made of rubber.  And anyway, I am just as strong as you are, Mac."
7743,BENDER,"Oh, yeah?  Prove it.  Here, let me help you."
7744,FARNSWORTH,My new bent outlook has completely re-energised me. I'm even dating a young Brazilian retired actress.
7745,FRY,Alright!
7746,FARNSWORTH,Some say I'm robbing the cradle but I say she's robbing the grave.
7747,BENDER,"Howdy, doodies. What's new?"
7748,FARNSWORTH,"I was just regaling your former co-workers with a tale of bedroom antics, the likes of which--"
7749,BENDER,"Yeah, yeah! Big whoop! No-one cares. I got Bender-related news. I'm in love and I'm taking all my friends out to celebrate."
7750,AMY,Let's get liquored up!
7751,ELZAR,"Hey, look at this crowd. You guys gotta try the pasta. It's got a real nice profit margin. Bam! So, special occasion tonight?"
7752,BENDER,"Oh, Elzar, you'll never guess what's happened?"
7753,ELZAR,Bam?
7754,BENDER,I met the most dynamite ladybot.
7755,ELZAR,"Hey, that's terrific. To celebrate, I'm gonna stick seven copies of my latest cookbook on your bill."
7756,BENDER,"Bless you, sir."
7757,FARNSWORTH,"So, Bender, tell us about this new girlfriend of yours."
7758,BENDER,"I intend to. Through the lost art of the toast.  To Angleyne, she's got it all. Looks, charm and the love of a fabulous bending robot."
7759,FRY,She sure does.
7760,BENDER,Flexo!
7761,ELZAR,"(shouting) Careful, that's a week old!"
7762,BENDER,"I finally meet a nice girl with a pair of legs that don't quit unexpectedly and that jerk Flexo steals her away? It's time to kick some shiny, metal ass.  You degenerate hussy! I'm disappointed in you too, Angleyne."
7763,ANGLEYNE,"Bender, it's-it's not what you think."
7764,BENDER,"Oh, God! Then it's worse than I think."
7765,ANGLEYNE,"Now look, there is no reason to be upset. Flexo and I are divorced."
7766,BENDER,Div-- Huh?
7767,FLEXO,We're just havin' dinner 'cause we wanna stay friends.
7768,BENDER,"Uh, I knew that. What I'm actually outraged by is your choice of wine. Really, it's the steward's fault."
7769,STEWARD,"Excellent choice, sir."
7770,BENDER,"(muttering) That Flexo, I'm knockin' him right on his butt. I can't believe this."
7771,FARNSWORTH,"Obsessing won't help, Bender. Take a lean back and enjoy life."
7772,BENDER,I can't. My Fembot may be in love with another Manbot.
7773,LEELA,Well talk to her. Tell her about your feelings in an open an honest way.
7774,FRY,Yeah. Either that or be a man.
7775,BENDER,"OK, I've constructed an elaborate lie: I'll call Angleyne while pretending to be Flexo, arrange a date, show up disguised as him and catch her two-timing me with myself."
7776,FRY,That's thinkin' like a man.
7777,BENDER,(disguised voice) Hello? This is Flexo.
7778,BENDER,Now we'll see who loves whom.
7779,BENDER,"Hey, hot stuff."
7780,ANGLEYNE,"Hey, Flexo.  So since when do you go to bars on work nights? It's not like you at all."
7781,BENDER,"Nonsense. It's exactly like me. Flexo: The fun loving love machine Fembots love to love. Hey, barkeep, I'll have a Fuzzy Navel and she'll have the girliest drink in the house."
7782,BARTENDERBOT,Two Fuzzy Navel's comin' up.
7783,BENDER,I hope they can make change for a fortune.
7784,JOEY,"Yo. Get an eyeload of that filty scab with the beard flashing his filthy scab money. It's an insult to you, boss."
7785,DONBOT,Yeah. That cash oughta be slushin' my fund and kicksing my back.
7786,CLAMPS,I'm greasing up my whoozits!
7787,DONBOT,"Whoa, whoa, Clamps, not yet. Let's just keep an eye on him and see if he does it a couple more times."
7788,BENDER,You're lookin' good to Flexo tonight.
7789,ANGLEYNE,Quit makin' with the googly eyes. You know that I'm in love with Bender.
7790,BENDER,Bender? That walking wuss factory?
7791,ANGLEYNE,Well he may be a walking factory but believe me he is no wuss. Now look. You and me are through. I told you that when I divorced you.
7792,BENDER,"But going through a divorce together, you can't tell me that didn't bring us closer. Care to dance?"
7793,ANGLEYNE,You know I love dancing but you always hated it.
7794,BENDER,"In that case it's something I've always wanted to make up to you.  Hey, scratchmo. How 'bout dropping me and the lady some rump-rattling beats?"
7795,DONBOT,I had hoped that by the second time he flashed his cash my rage would have subsided. Sadly that has not happened.
7796,ANGLEYNE,"You used to be so inflexible, Flexo. You have really loosened up!"
7797,BENDER,I recently upgraded my funk card. C'mon!
7798,ANGLEYNE,Alright!
7799,BENDER,"C'mon now, what's new!  Ew!"
7800,ANGLEYNE,Flexo? What-What's going on?
7801,BENDER,Um...
7802,ANGLEYNE,Flexo!
7803,BENDER,"So the moral of the story is: If you want it to stay sunk, tie a weight to it!"
7804,ANGLEYNE,"(laughing) You always were a kick in the teeth, man."
7805,BENDER,"Aw, shucks, thunder-buns! You make me feel like a million volts."
7806,ANGLEYNE,"Flexo, Flexo, Flexo. I'm starting to remember why I fell for you in the first place."
7807,BENDER,"(thinking) So, she's falling for Flexo, eh? I'd better seduce her a little more, just to be sure."
7808,ANGLEYNE,"Well, it's late. I should get home to my trailer."
7809,BENDER,"I'll walk you out. After all, a true gentleman tends to his date's every need.  Tiparillo?"
7810,BENDER,"Here you are, my lad. Bring the lady's car around in the finest way possible."
7811,JOEY,He's flashin' his cash loaf again.
7812,DONBOT,How many times is that? Two or three?
7813,CLAMPS,Three.
7814,DONBOT,Alright. That's the necessary number of times. That scab's gonna have a little on-the-job accident.
7815,JOEY,"With all due respect, Donbot, I don't think we should rely on an accident happening. Let's kill him ourselves."
7816,ANGLEYNE,"Well, goodnight. I-I had a great time."
7817,BENDER,How 'bout a lift? To your place.
7818,ANGLEYNE,What?
7819,BENDER,Admit it. You felt something for me tonight. And by me I mean Flexo.
7820,ANGLEYNE,"Hey look, I had fun but--"
7821,BENDER,But?
7822,ANGLEYNE,But--
7823,BENDER,Buuut?
7824,ANGLEYNE,(gasping) But...  Huh? Bender! You tricked me.
7825,BENDER,"That's right, baby. I ain't your lover boy, Flexo, the guy you love so much. You even love anybody pretending to be him."
7826,ANGLEYNE,Well maybe I love you so much I love you no matter who you're pretending to be.
7827,BENDER,"Oh, how I wish I could believe or understand that! There's only one reasonable course of action now: Kill Flexo.  Ow!"
7828,ANGLEYNE,(screaming) Nooo!
7829,FLEXO,"Thanks, I appreciate that.  Nah, I'm joshing you. That was quite annoying."
7830,BENDER,You call yourself divorced? You're making a mockery of one of our oldest institutions.
7831,FLEXO,What?
7832,CLAMPS,"Alright, boss, give the word and I'll drop this unbendable girder. Clamp, clamp, ka-bamp!"
7833,DONBOT,"Remember, only kill the one with the beard. That other filthy scab we got nothing against."
7834,FLEXO,That's low!
7835,ANGLEYNE,Please stop! I'm not worth it!
7836,BENDER,Probably not. But I love you And I'm gonna kick his ass 'til I win you back.
7837,DONBOT,"(from control room) OK, Clamps. Now!"
7838,CLAMPS,"Ooh, that's gotta clamp!"
7839,ANGLEYNE,Flexo? Are you OK?
7840,FLEXO,"Yeah, never better.  Nah, I'm yankin' your chain, I'm dying."
7841,ANGLEYNE,You can't die. Tonight Bender showed me that I love you.
7842,BENDER,"But, I love you."
7843,ANGLEYNE,I know and I care for you too. But I could never love anyone as much as you made me realise I love Flexo.
7844,BENDER,"But ... but ...  I love you so much, Angleyne, I want you to be happy no matter what."
7845,ANGLEYNE,"What, what are you saying?"
7846,BENDER,I'm saying I've got an unbendable girder to bend.
7847,ANGLEYNE,You can't bend that girder. It's unbendable!
7848,BENDER,"Well I don't know anything about lifting, so that just leaves us the one option."
7849,FLEXO,"Thanks, buddy. Another year under that and I'd have been a goner."
7850,ANGLEYNE,"I'll always remember this, Bender."
7851,BENDER,(crying) Me too. Me too. (talking) Jerk.
7852,LEELA,"So Flexo and Angleyne had sex right there on the factory floor? Well, at least you got bending out of your system."
7853,BENDER,"Yes. I won't be up to bending again for a long, long time."
7854,FARNSWORTH,Perhaps it's your outlook that needs a good bend. A 90-degree bend to a place where happiness is perpendicular to wonderment.
7855,FRY,"Professor, we're all sick of your upbeat attitude."
7856,AMY,I'll say.
7857,ZOIDBERG,Believe it.
7858,FARNSWORTH,Nonsense. It's just like in the song I wrote:
7859,LEELA,"Bender, you've gotta help us."
7860,BENDER,I try to get out but they keep pulling me back in.
7861,FARNSWORTH,"(singing) You gotta dangle,"
7862,AMY,"No, Bender! The other way."
7863,BENDER,I like him better this way.
7864,FARNSWORTH,I'm sad now.
7865,LEELA,"Eh, it's fine."
7866,THE END,
7867,"""THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STUPID""",
7868,AMY,Is Nibbler stoked for the big pet show?
7869,LEELA,He ought to be with all the strict training I've been putting him through.  Nibbler: Roll over and you get a ham.  Roll over. Roll over for the ham.  You are so adorable! Who wants a ham?
7870,FARNSWORTH,Zooka barooka! First prize is $500 and a year's supply of dog food!
7871,BENDER,"""$500"", you say?"
7872,ZOIDBERG,"""Dog food"", you say?"
7873,FRY,"Man, that's dog's gonna be hard to beat. Look at him bring in the sheep! One sheep, two sheep......three sheep."
7874,LEELA,"The dog's good, but our real competition is the Hypno-Toad.  Your turn, Nibbler, honey. Herd those sheep!"
7875,AMY,"Come on, Nibbler!"
7876,BENDER,"Ma'am, I have a late entry.  My hard-shelled wooping terrier, Mr. Zoidberg."
7877,BENDER,Faster! Faster.
7878,ZOIDBERG,Ow!
7879,BENDER,Suck in that gut! You wanna be spayed?
7880,BENDER,"Silence, you cur! Puff out that brisket!"
7881,BENDER,I should be weeping! I'm not weeping!
7882,FRY,I love these things!
7883,LEELA,"Shake paws, Nibbler. Come on, shake. He might be a little hungry. Shake, boy. Usually he's had more ham by now. Shake!"
7884,JUDGE #1,"Third prize, a party-sized keg of guinea pigs, goes to Dave Spiegel and his owner, Fluffers.  Second prize, this lovely afghan made from an Afghan, goes to Bender and his wooping terrier."
7885,BENDER,Second place?  That's a fancy word for losing.  You didn't stick your landing!
7886,ZOIDBERG,"Forgive me, my friend."
7887,BENDER,Never!
7888,JUDGE #1,"And before we announce the winner we have a special award for a first-time contestant: Miss Leela and her mystery pet, Nibbler!"
7889,LEELA,Me? Award? Him? Me? Good?
7890,JUDGE #1,That's just the kind of eloquence you'd expect from the owner of Dumbest Pet in Show.  And the grand prize winner......the Hypno-Toad.  All glory to the Hypno-Toad.]
7891,LEELA,Maybe they're right. Maybe Nibbler is dumb.
7892,FRY,"Don't listen to them, Leela. People said I was dumb, but I proved them."
7893,FARNSWORTH,"Good news, everyone. We were supposed to make a delivery to the planet Tweenis 12 but it's been completely destroyed."
7894,LEELA,Why is that good news?
7895,FARNSWORTH,They paid in advance.
7896,BENDER,Excuse me.
7897,HERMES,"This is mighty strange.  First, the civilisation Space Rome collapsed, then Don Martin 3 went caflooie and now Tweenis 12."
7898,FRY,Looks like this planet is next in line.
7899,LEELA,That's Earth.  The planet we live on.
7900,FRY,I'd hate to be those guys.
7901,HERMES,"What's got into him? He's twitching like Zoidberg when someone mentions the word ""food""."
7902,ZOIDBERG,What now?
7903,LEELA,"(shouting) No! Nibbler, come back!"
7904,LEELA,"Too bad Nibbler's not around. I guess I'll have to eat this raw, dripping ham by myself.  Nibbler?  Nibbler, you're scaring me.  Nibbler?!  Am I going crazy? Have my years of wild hedonism finally caught up with me?  Nibbler, help! Don't leave me here.  Uh, Nibbler? Could you scooch the seat up just a little bit?"
7905,FRY,Leela back yet?
7906,BENDER,"Fry, help me! My heart stopped beating!"
7907,FRY,You don't have a heart; you're a robot.
7908,BENDER,"Sure...right. Robot!  Oh, Fry! My skin's all dry and clanky."
7909,FRY,"Well, yeah. Robots are made of metal."
7910,BENDER,Am I a robot?
7911,FRY,"Bender, if this is some kind of scam, I don't get it. You already have my power of attorney."
7912,BENDER,Fry!  My skin!
7913,FARNSWORTH,Ow. Ow. Ow.  I'm a genius. Ow. Ow.
7914,FRY,Dr. Zoidberg? Why is everyone acting so weird?
7915,ZOIDBERG,Zoidy want balloon! Want balloon now! Zoidy want go outside!
7916,FRY,(angry) I just let you back in!
7917,LEELA,"This is unbelievable. I thought you were a furry little moron. But here you are flying an adorable spaceship. If only you could talk.  Wait! I understood that!  You say you're transmitting your thoughts directly to my brain.  You say those awful flying brains are making everyone on Earth stupid?  Oh, stupider. And you go on to say that we're headed for your home planet where your race has lived since the beginning of the universe?  So, how did the universe begin?  Then the meaning of existence...? So every religion is wrong!"
7918,LINDA,"You fell!  Hi! Today, some bad things happened. One bad things was a train got crashed in New Jersey. Wanna see? People won't be late for work though, because the governer lady says, (deeper voice) ""I'm sending in more trains!"""
7919,WOMAN,Go!
7920,MAN,Wait for me! Wait for me!
7921,MORBO,Morbo can't understand his TelePrompTer. He forgot how you say that letter that looks like a man with a hat.
7922,LINDA,"It's a ""T"". It goes ""tuh""."
7923,MORBO,"Hello, little man. I will destroy you!"
7924,FRY,"Man, even the news monster is acting strange. What are we gonna do?"
7925,FARNSWORTH,"Duh, I know! Let's play the lottery!"
7926,AMY,No. Let's buy internet stock!
7927,ZOIDBERG,On margin! Zoidy wanna buy on margin!
7928,HERMES,Look at me! I'm invisible!
7929,FRY,Wait a minute! I know what's going on here. You've all become idiots!
7930,BENDER,"Hey, let's all join the Reform Party!"
7931,HERMES,"Oh, yeah!"
7932,KEN,"Welcome back, Lord Nibbler, Ambassador to Earth, homeworld of the pizza bagel."
7933,NIBBLER,Thank you. I bear many receipts for reimbursement.
7934,FIONA,"The four welcomes of friendship to you as well, Leela. We shall manipulate your mind so we appear to be speaking your language. Do not be afraid, my child."
7935,LEELA,I'm not afraid.
7936,FIONA,"Uh, good. Good."
7937,LEELA,"So, your real name is Lord Nibbler? That's a coincidence."
7938,NIBBLER,That name is for your sake. In the time it would take to pronounce one letter of my true name a trillion cosmoses would flair into existence and sink into eternal night.
7939,LEELA,"Oh, you're all so cute!"
7940,KEN,"No, we are not.  We Nibblonians are an ancient and powerful race. Behold. When the universe was forged in the crucible of the big bang, our mighty race was already 17 years old."
7941,LEELA,Aww!
7942,KEN,"For the first millisecond of time, things were OK. But then there arose a terrible enemy: The Brain Spawn.  Ever since, we have waged unceasing war against these dreadful --"
7943,NIBBLONIAN CHEF,Lunch is ready.
7944,KEN,Then let the feast of a thousand hams begin.
7945,LEELA,"So why are these Brain Spawn attacking Earth, Nibbler?"
7946,NIBBLER,The Brain Spawn hate all consciousness. The thoughts of others screech at them like the forced laughs of a billion art house movie patrons.
7947,KEN,"Thus, they travel from world to world making everyone stupid in order to wipe out all thought in the universe."
7948,LEELA,Wipe out all thought? My God! They're like flying televisions.
7949,FIONA,"And even we are powerless to stop them, fearsome though we are."
7950,NIBBLER,There is but one being that can resist them. A child of destiny whose bizzare brain wave pattern makes him immune to the Brain Spawn attack.  He is the hope of the universe.  The fate of your world - perhaps all worlds - rests in his special mind.
7951,LEELA,"Now, when you say ""special""..."
7952,FRY,Attention New New Yorkers. Stop acting so stupid!
7953,KEN,"Nibblonian fleet holding at perimeter of moron zone, formerly known as ""Earth""."
7954,LEELA,Why would Fry be immune to the flying brains? Because he doesn't shower?
7955,FIONA,"The Brain Spawn suppress intelligence by attacking the delta brain wave. Every animal and robot in the universe generates this wave, as do certain trees."
7956,NIBBLER,"Fry, however, does not."
7957,FIONA,Somehow he has cobbled together a random assortment of other brainwaves into a working mind.
7958,LEELA,Like a prom dress made from carpet remnants.
7959,NIBBLER,"Yes, like your prom dress."
7960,KEN,The Brain Spawn are commanded by a giant evil brain with a gooey centre of pure hate.
7961,FIONA,"Only Fry, with is superior, yet inferior mind, can approach him. You must tell him to disable it. We will do the rest."
7962,LEELA,You can count on me.
7963,FIONA,"No we can't. Once on Earth, you will be too stupid to remember the message."
7964,NIBBLER,That's why we wrote it down for you.
7965,KEN,We've also prepared a bag lunch and some mittens.
7966,FRY,"Time to re-educate you duncebags. We'll start with US presidents.  This is our first president, George Washington. Let's review. Who was our first president?"
7967,AMY,Umm...
7968,BENDER,A pickle jar?
7969,WASHINGTON,Thomas Jefferson?
7970,FRY,Leela! I've been so worried. Are you a bonehead?
7971,LEELA,I...have to tell...must...important...something...
7972,FRY,"Whoa, whoa! Slow down. You're going a mile a minute."
7973,LEELA,This! You for this!
7974,FRY,Thanks!
7975,LEELA,No!  Ow! Fire hot.
7976,FARNSWORTH,The professy will help!  Fire indeed hot!
7977,ARTHUR,Oh! Chester A. Arthur fall down.
7978,LEELA,Brain. Brain make people dumb.
7979,FRY,"No, Leela. Brain make people smart."
7980,LEELA,You go fight biggest brain of all.
7981,FRY,Even bigger than those? Holy nuts! Where is it?
7982,LEELA,I 'unno!
7983,FRY,Hm. A giant brain is basically a giant nerd. And where would a giant nerd be? The libary!
7984,BIG BRAIN,"Pathetic human race. Arranging their knowledge by category just made it easier to absorb. Dewey, you fool: Your decimal system has played right into my hands! What do you want?"
7985,FRY,I'm here to kick your ass.
7986,BIG BRAIN,Wishful thinking. We have long since evolved beyond the need for asses. Odd. My stupefaction field is having no effect on your ability to think.
7987,FRY,"That's right. And I think you'll find that a little knowledge is a dangerous thing!  OK, better think of a new plan. Come on, Fry, think!  Thinking...thinking..."
7988,BIG BRAIN,Oh! Stop that!
7989,FRY,"Hey! Thinking hurts him. Maybe I can think of a way to use that.  Aha! Prepare to be thought at. Leela, give me a topic."
7990,LEELA,Duh...
7991,FRY,"Seriously, I can't think of anything. Gotta find something to make me think. (reading) Hardy Boys. (talking) Too easy. (reading) Nancy Drew. (talking) Too hard. Aha! Perfect! Bonfire of the Vanities!"
7992,BIG BRAIN,No! It's unbearable!
7993,FIONA,The brains are weakening.  Nibblonians to Nibble stations. Prepare cuddle bug for deployment in 40 nibblets.
7994,NIBBLER,Sometimes I fear we are cute.
7995,FIONA,"Oh, niggle-snoosh!"
7996,FRY,Take that! And that! This sentence I don't understand but take this one!
7997,BIG BRAIN,You have not won yet.  Each book in this room is a gateway to a mental realm and I shall take you there and imprison you forever.
7998,LEELA,Icky!
7999,FRY,Where are we?
8000,AHAB,A gold doubloon to the man who first spies the white whale.
8001,QUEEQUEG,Big whale over there.
8002,AHAB,I saw it first!
8003,QUEEQUEG,"Wait! That no white whale. It grey, pink-y whale!"
8004,FRY,"Queequeg, let go of me! I have to kill it!"
8005,BIG BRAIN,"Farewell! You will all be trapped in this dense, symbolist tome forever!"
8006,FRY,Follow him! It's our only way out!
8007,FRY,"Excuse me, have you seen a giant brain?"
8008,TOM SAWYER,Yep. I let him help me whitewash Aunt Polly's fence.
8009,BIG BRAIN,"Tom Sawyer, you tricked me. This is less fun than previously indicated. Let this corny slice of Americana be your tomb for all eternity."
8010,TOM SAWYER,"Please, no!"
8011,FRY,(shouting) Come on!
8012,WOMAN,"Mr. Fry, Mama tells us you're quite the oddity; a bachelor at your age."
8013,FRY,Tou think I'm an oddity? Wait'l you see --
8014,BUTLER,"Presenting the most eligible landowner in all Hertfordshire, Mr. Brainly."
8015,BIG BRAIN,I'm a gigantic brain!
8016,MAN #1,I say!
8017,MAN #2,Most ungentleman-like!
8018,WOMAN,"Mr. Brainly, what news have you of the London season?"
8019,BIG BRAIN,Well...
8020,FRY,"Hey, Brain-y, think fast!"
8021,BIG BRAIN,I always think fast.
8022,AHAB,The whale! He be white now!
8023,FRY,"Leela, I've got an idea. Stay here with Queequeg."
8024,LEELA,Is there Mrs. Queequeg?
8025,FRY,"Yes! I'm free!  Alright, Brain. Get ready for some electroshock treatment!"
8026,LEELA,"Fry, don't die! Wake up!  (screaming) Nooo!"
8027,FRY,"Leela cried for her lost love as Fry lay dead under the heavy bookcase. The Big Brain laughed in triumph......Then, for no reason, he left Earth forever. The end.  There!  Now he's trapped in a book I wrote: A crummy world of plot holes and spelling errors."
8028,BIG BRAIN,The Big Brain am winning again. I am the greetest!  Now I am leaving Earth for no rason!
8029,NIBBLER,The Big Brain is defeated. Let what must be done be done.
8030,LEELA,Me...feel...a bit better in cognitive faculties.
8031,FRY,I did it!  And it's all thanks to the books at my local library.
8032,NIBBLER,(voice-over) And so life returned to normal. Or as normal as it gets on this primative dirtball inhabited by psychotic apes...
8033,NIBBLER,"(voice-over) ...Thanks to the effect of the brain rays, the people of Earth had no memory of what had transpired, except Fry. And no one believed him or cared what he had to say..."
8034,NIBBLER,"(voice-over) ...I, meanwhile, returned to my post, ever vigilant, lest Earth again come under Brain attack. And when that day comes, God help us. God help us all."
8035,LEELA,Time for a diapee change!
8036,NIBBLER,(voice-over) End transmission.
8037,THE END,
8038,"""THAT'S LOBSTERTAINMENT""",
8039,ROBOT,"So I says, ""Super collider? I just met her!""  And then they built the super collider. Thank you, you've been a great audience."
8040,FLORP,"Humorbot 5.0, ladies and gentlemen. Our next stand-up's a veteran of four comedy traffic schools. Give it way up for Bobcat Zoidberg!"
8041,FRY,(cheering) Alright!
8042,LEELA,(cheering) Yeah!
8043,BENDER,"(cheering) Alright, Zoidberg!"
8044,ZOIDBERG,"Earth. What a planet. On Earth, you enjoy eating a tasty clam. On my planet, clams enjoy eating a tasty you.  Maybe I'm not yelling loud enough. (shouting) On Earth, everybody is always looking for a giant squid. On my planet -"
8045,BENDER,Reload.
8046,ZOIDBERG,So these three parasitic worms bore into a human's head...
8047,WOMAN,"Eww, gross."
8048,ZOIDBERG,"...and they walk up to the bar and then - uh-oh.  Wait, stop! I've got more! (groaning) Oh."
8049,ZOIDBERG,My whole life I worked on that act. And they hated it.
8050,HERMES,"You're a crazy, penniless, lobster doctor. No combination of you should be a comedian."
8051,ZOIDBERG,But comedy is in my valves. My Uncle Harold was a big Hollywood star back in the era of silent holograms.
8052,LEELA,(awestruck) Your uncle was Harold Zoid?
8053,ZOIDBERG,(dramatic) This I cannot deny.
8054,FARNSWORTH,"Why, I've been a Harold Zoid fan since back when my hips were made of bone. As it happens, I still have some of my original 78s."
8055,HERMES,"You're right, crabby. He's a hell of a lot funnier than you could ever be."
8056,ZOIDBERG,"Maybe so, but perhaps if I wrote him and asked for a few hundred pointers..."
8057,ZOIDBERG,"This letter has to be very personal, so I'm writing it in my own ink.  (writing; thinking) Dear Uncle Zoid, Greetings from your long-lost nephew. Norm and Sam and Sadie's boy, remember? ..."
8058,ZOIDBERG,"(voice-over) ...Now I am the most important doctor at the delivery company where I work. But, sadly, my life is bereft of laughter."
8059,ZOID,"(reading) I beg of you, Mr. Funny Uncle, teach me the comedy business. Sincerely, Zoidberg. (talking) Oy, isn't that nice? He took the time."
8060,WOMAN,What's that scribbldy-gook?
8061,ZOID,"This is a fan letter from my rich doctor nephew who just might be my ticket out of this flophouse, he might.  Yeah, you'd better run.  (writing) Dear Rich Doctor Nephew, I can help you be funny. The first funny thing you must do is put all of your money in the form of a cashier's cheque and come to Hollywood."
8062,ZOIDBERG,"(reading) Sincerely, Harold Zoid. P.S. Cashier's cheque. (talking) Did you hear that? I'm going to Hollywood!"
8063,TOUR GUIDE,"Welcome to Hollywood! I must warn you, there's no refund if you get discovered and leave the tour!  I'm just kidding, that never happens. Now, to your right, you'll see 30th Century Fox Studios. Fox uses those searchlights to blind pilots, then film the resulting plane crashes."
8064,BENDER,Neat!
8065,TOUR GUIDE,"Ahead, you'll see the home of Mel Gibson, star of the hit film, Bravehead.  And do we have any fans of Calculon, star of the robot soap opera All My Circuits?"
8066,BENDER,"Oh, I am, me!  Bender is!"
8067,TOUR GUIDE,Then you'll wanna get a close look at his luxurious Bel-Air home.
8068,BENDER,"Yes, I will."
8069,CALCULON,Are you my new hot water heater?
8070,BENDER,"No, I'm Bender. We met once, remember?"
8071,CALCULON,Absolutely not.
8072,BENDER,"Come on, don't you remember how much I was bugging you, don't you? 'Cause it was a lot, you remember, right?"
8073,CALCULON,"Look, I'm programmed to be very busy. Unless you can heat water to 212 degrees, I'm not interested.  Have you got an extra GOTO 10 line? I said I don't need a bender."
8074,BENDER,Bender? That was the other guy. My name's Boiler.
8075,CALCULON,"Nice work, Boiler."
8076,BENDER,Thanks. And call me Bender.
8077,ZOIDBERG,"That's where I'm meeting Uncle Zoid for lunch to discuss my Hollywood dreams. Next time you see me, don't be surprised if I've eaten."
8078,ZOIDBERG,"Uncle Zoid, you're looking young enough to be throw back!"
8079,ZOID,"Rich nephew, come over here and give your uncle a nice, big meal.  So, here we are: A still-famous film comedian..."
8080,ZOIDBERG,"...And a rich, respected doctor with many surviving patients."
8081,ZOID,"Eating real food in a restaurant, as we both often do. So, you want to be a comedian, is it?"
8082,ZOIDBERG,It's my lifelong dream.
8083,ZOID,(shouting) Well that dream dies now. You're unfunny and untalented. That's why you're perfect for drama.
8084,ZOIDBERG,"Hmm, serious drama. Perhaps it is time to give up comedy."
8085,ZOID,"I'm putting together a big drama picture right now, as we speak. The script is dynamite. I know because I wrote it myself. And with me directing and starring, I'll be back on top after 50 miserable years......uh, of fame."
8086,ZOIDBERG,"Ah, fame. Where do I come in?"
8087,ZOID,"This fame film has a juicy part for you, if you completely finance it with your doctor money. So, are you in?"
8088,ZOIDBERG,"Uh, OK. How much do I have to invest?"
8089,ZOID,"Oh, not much, not much, (quietly) amilliondollars. (talking) Then it's settled. Another blockbuster Hollywood deal."
8090,WAITER,What can I get you gentlemen?
8091,ZOIDBERG,Is bread free?
8092,WAITER,Yeah.
8093,ZOIDBERG,We'll split an order.
8094,BENDER,What's with Monstro?
8095,FRY,He promised he'd give his Uncle Zoid a million bucks to make a movie.
8096,ZOIDBERG,(crying) I've only been here a day and already I'm a Hollywood phoney.
8097,BENDER,"(proud) Well, perhaps I could call on TVs Calculon to help, now that I'm in showbiz."
8098,FRY,Since when have you been in the biz?
8099,BENDER,"Long enough, little man. Long enough."
8100,BENDER,"Calculon, as your hot water heater......I would be remiss if I didn't bring you scripts that could make you an international film star."
8101,CALCULON,Of course. Tell me about the project.
8102,ZOIDBERG,It's a movie.
8103,CALCULON,Interesting. Tell me more.
8104,BENDER,"Get this: For a scant $1 million investment, you can be the star."
8105,CALCULON,And?
8106,BENDER,"And, uh, I guarantee it'll win you an Oscar."
8107,CALCULON,"An Oscar, you say? That would get me out of this festering rat's nest called ""television"" once and for all. Let me see the script.  No, no I don't like the font.  Wait! Harold Zoid? Was this written by the Harold Zoid?"
8108,ZOIDBERG,Written and Xeroxed.
8109,CALCULON,"Good heavens. A chance to work with the legendary Harold Zoid. He's one of my great idols. And, and you say you can guarantee me the Oscar?"
8110,BENDER,I can guarantee anything you want.
8111,CALCULON,Then I'll do it!
8112,ZOIDBERG,Hooray!
8113,BENDER,Here's your chequebook.
8114,CALCULON,"Ladies and gentlemen, I give you our director, the legendary Harold Zoid!"
8115,ZOID,"Thank you. A more classic movie plot there isn't: A son who does not want to follow in his father's business. And that business is being president of Earth, no less. The son, as it happens, is vice president."
8116,BENDER,"(to Calculon) That plot makes perfect sense, wink wink."
8117,ZOIDBERG,"Bender, you said ""wink wink"" out loud."
8118,BENDER,"No, I didn't. (quietly) Raise middle finger."
8119,ZOID,"Now, remember, and I can't stress this enough, this is a talkie. So I want the full gamut of emotions from every actor in every scene."
8120,ZOIDBERG,"The Magnificent Three. Scene one, take one."
8121,ZOID,"And, action!"
8122,CALCULON,"Take back your gilded pen, Father. Signing bills into law was always your dream, not mine."
8123,ZOID,"Cut! Cut! Cut it!  I said this is a talkie, damnit! You've got to emote more! And you extras: Wave your arms and make faces. What is this, a morgue?"
8124,ZOIDBERG,"The Magnificent Three. Scene 10, take 95."
8125,ZOID,Action. And I mean circus-grade action.
8126,CALCULON,"Sir, I call upon you not as a president but as a father."
8127,ZOID,"Cut, cut, cut it!  Would you show a little emotion?  People, people, please. Just because it's a dramatic scene, doesn't mean you can't do a little comedy in the background.  Throw a pie or two, for God's sake."
8128,CALCULON,(screaming) Nooo!
8129,ZOID,"Cut, cut it! Eck! Look, look, it's alright, kid. We'll, uh, we'll get it in editing. Alright, that's a wrap everybody, I'm gonna see you all at the premiere which, by the way, when is?"
8130,ZOIDBERG,"Well, uh, editing is a long and expensive process but we spent all the money on pies, so it'll be ready Friday."
8131,BENDER,"Nice turnout, Calculon. That Oscar's practically on your mantel."
8132,CALCULON,I just pray they like me half as much as I do.
8133,CALCULON,"(in movie) I agreed to be your vice president but I never agreed to be your son.  Thank you, Lieutenant Smith."
8134,ZOIDBERG,"(in movie) Good morning, Mr. Vice President!"
8135,FRY,"Leela, we're missing the premiere. My only goal in life was to attend a Hollywood shindig. Just pay the valet the two bucks."
8136,LEELA,"No! It's the principle of the thing. Besides, I think I see a parking lot up ahead."
8137,CALCULON,"(in movie) Father, I have asked you to join me on the White House roof so we could have a heart-to-heart talk. I will never follow in your footsteps. Here is my resignation as vice president."
8138,ZOID,"(in movie) No! My son will not shame me like this. I would sooner die, I would!"
8139,CALCULON,(in movie) Father! The ledge!
8140,ZOID,(in movie) Oy!
8141,CALCULON,(in movie) Oh.
8142,ZOIDBERG,"(in movie) The president is dead. Congratulations, Mr. President."
8143,CALCULON,(screaming; in movie) Nooo!
8144,BENDER,(cheering) Woohoo! Yeah! He's a visionary!
8145,CALCULON,Everyone walked out. They hated it. I've seen plagues that have better opening nights than this. You said that Oscar was practically on my mantel.
8146,BENDER,"Now you know why I use the qualifier, ""practically""."
8147,CALCULON,"You listen to me. I'm out a million bucks here! You get me that Oscar, or you're dead! You and these snivelling lobsters! Dead. You hear me? Dead!"
8148,ZOID,"Oy, now he emotes!"
8149,CALCULON,400 categories and not a single nomination for me.
8150,ZOIDBERG,But you won this Golden Globe!
8151,CALCULON,Piffle! That's the Emmy of movie awards! I told you I want an Oscar.
8152,BENDER,Then maybe you should act better.
8153,CALCULON,The Oscar isn't about acting. It's about earning the respect and admiration of the creative community.
8154,ZOID,How 'bout we rig the awards?
8155,CALCULON,That's fine too.
8156,LEELA,"It's no use. The tar is too thick. Plus, I think I flooded it."
8157,FRY,"Well, we missed the premiere and we're gonna die. We might as well enjoy the sights.  Oh my God, Sylvester Stallone!"
8158,ZOIDBERG,This is where you live? I though you were a big-shot Hollywood movie star.
8159,ZOID,"No, I'm not. I'm an even bigger liar than you. My career went down the tube the day they invented smell-a-vision."
8160,BENDER,Calculon's gonna kill us for sure. It's all everybody else's fault.
8161,ZOID,Oy. All I wanted was for people to think of me one last time before I die.
8162,ZOIDBERG,What are you talking about? Everybody remembers Harold Zoid!
8163,ZOID,"As a pathetic has-been, they remember me. As a forgotten relic, they remember me. Bah! It's better to die now."
8164,ZOIDBERG,No. This is one death Dr. Zoidberg won't be responsible for. Zoidberg away!
8165,RIVERS,"Hi, I'm Joan Rivers's head. I tell you, I've had so many face-lifts, they finally lifted it right off my body! It's true, it's true! Oh, oh, oh, here comes Jack Nicholson's DNA, reconstituted in a gorilla body."
8166,BENDER,Catering.
8167,RIVERS,"Oh, and here's washed-up actor, what's-his-name, Harold Zoid. Are you presenting one of those tacky honorary awards, or just getting one?"
8168,ZOID,"I'm a seat-filler, Joan's head. My only marketable skill is to occupy space."
8169,CALCULON,"You know, the second I don't win that award, you're cat food. Right, Boxy?"
8170,ANNOUNCER,"And now, the host of the 1074th Academy Awards, Billy Crystal."
8171,CRYSTAL,"Now I know how a Pez dispenser feels. Alright, we're already one hour behind. Our first award tonight, Best Cinematography in a Non-Visible Spectrum."
8172,FRY,It's been two weeks. You wanna play tic-tac-toe again before we eat our shoes?
8173,LEELA,"Oh, I always knew I'd die at the bottom of a pit. But a pit full of tar?"
8174,FRY,What was that? A tar dolphin or a tar shark?
8175,LEELA,"It's some kind of hollow tube, devoid of human life.  The Los Angeles subway! We can blast our way in and escape!"
8176,FRY,"Alright, but I still feel like having a shoe."
8177,ZOIDBERG,What category are they on?
8178,BENDER,They're giving out the minor technical awards. I think they're up to writing.
8179,ZOIDBERG,That leave Best Soft-Drink Product Placement and then Best Actor. We don't have much time.
8180,CRYSTAL,And the nominees for Best Soft-Drink Product Placement are:
8181,SLURM MACHINE,"Star Trek: The Pepsi Generation, They Call Me Mr. Pibb and Snow White And The 7 Ups."
8182,BENDER,"And now, to present the award for Best Actor......a bit player in the flop movie The Magnificent Three......Dr. Zoidberg."
8183,CALCULON,"(quietly) OK, Boxy, keep your prong on the trigger."
8184,ZOIDBERG,"And the nominees for Best Actor are: Sir Lawrence...... in The Merchant Of Venus, Hive Mind Gamma 7X in Bikini Party Summer, the Soda Machine Robot in Bikini Party Summer, Mark Jones in How Beige Was My Jacket and, instead of the fifth guy - Calculon, for his powerhouse performance in The Magnificent Three."
8185,MAN #1,"Uh-oh, he read the wrong name."
8186,MAN #2,"(whispering) Shh, just play along, like they did with Marisa Tomei."
8187,ZOID,"Hooray, I won't be murdered. I'll live another day. Another day of...pathetic, forgotten misery."
8188,ZOIDBERG,"And the winner is... And the winner, instead of any of the nominees, is the legendary Harold Zoid!"
8189,ZOID,"Thank you. Thank you so much! You know, through all my ups and downs, I always thought the most important thing in life was to win an Oscar. But tonight I realise what's really important is to win two Oscars. Ha, ha! I'm kidding, I'm kidding. What really matters in life is that people care about you, whether it's a whole crowd......or just one die-hard fan."
8190,ZOID,"Thank you, nephew.  Now I can die happy. 10 seconds from now, when Calculon kills us."
8191,CALCULON,Harold Zoid!
8192,BENDER,Hit the deck!
8193,CALCULON,Where's that Oscar?
8194,ZOID,"Here, enjoy. What are you getting upset? It's slightly less fraudulent for you to have it."
8195,CALCULON,"Yes, yes it's a real beauty. Someday I hope to win one of my own."
8196,BENDER,"Then you're not going to kill us, Your Majesty?"
8197,CALCULON,Nay. I respect and admire Harold Zoid too much to beat him to death with his own Oscar.
8198,ZOIDBERG,Earthquake!
8199,BENDER,Hit the deck!
8200,ZOID,"Let the earth quake, I've got somebody's Oscar!"
8201,FRY,We made it! I'm at a Hollywood party!
8202,DOORMAN,"I'm sorry, sir, this is a private - oh, pardon me, I see you're with Mr. Stallone."
8203,THE END,
8204,"""THE BIRDBOT OF ICECATRAZ""",
8205,LEELA,"Fry, I know those cookies are fresh-a-licious but they produce an awful lot of trash."
8206,BENDER,Ah!
8207,LEELA,"And Bender, that aerosol head spray makes your head smell nice..."
8208,BENDER,Thank you.
8209,LEELA,...but it's doing long-term damage to the planet.
8210,BENDER,So? It's not like it's the only one we've got!
8211,FARNSWORTH,Good news everyone! I'm sending you on an extremely controversial mission!
8212,FRY,Controversial?
8213,FARNSWORTH,Oh my no.
8214,FARNSWORTH,"For this highly controversial mission, you'll be towing the Juan Valdez, an orbitting supertanker full of rich Columbian dark matter."
8215,LEELA,Dark matter oil? What if we hit something? The tanker could leak!
8216,FARNSWORTH,"Impossible!  The tanker has 6000 hulls. So, unlike me, it's entirely leak-proof! Now, once you've hauled the tanker past the protestors -"
8217,LEELA,Protestors?
8218,FARNSWORTH,Correct. 6000 hulls.
8219,LEELA,Why do we have to fly within three feet of this penguin preserve on Pluto?
8220,FARNSWORTH,(whispering) To avoid the tollbooth.
8221,FRY,"Alright, she's all restocked with emergency jam. Let's get going."
8222,LEELA,"At the risk of sounding negative: No! Look Professor, I can't participate in this mission."
8223,FARNSWORTH,What are you yapping about?
8224,LEELA,"This time it's your reckless disregard for the environment. In fact, I'm gonna go join those protestors."
8225,FARNSWORTH,This is an outrage. I demand that you hand over your captain's jacket.
8226,LEELA,This is my normal jacket. I've had it for 10 years.
8227,FARNSWORTH,"I said hand it over!  Well Fry, or should I say Captain Fry?  No I shouldn't. Because Bender is the new captain!"
8228,FRY,Bender?
8229,FARNSWORTH,"That's right. Being a captain is about intuition and heart. A good captain can't have either one. That's why cold, logical Bender is perfect for the job."
8230,BENDER,"Well, I do think of human life as expendable."
8231,FRY,No fair. Leela was training me to be captain. She even let me sit in her lap and steer - in this comic I drew.
8232,ZOIDBERG,"Ooo, the new one's out!"
8233,BENDER,"Fry, the title of captain may inflate the human ego, but it's beneath the notice of my mighty robo-logic!  Now look spry men! We launch at six bells!"
8234,WATERFALL SR,"Greetings Econauts. I'm Free Waterfall Sr, founder of Penguins Unlimited. Whoa! No, no! No applause. Every time you clap your hands you kill thousands of spores that'll some day form a nutritious fungus. Just show your approval with a mould-friendly thumbs up!  Please hold your thumbs until the end. Now folks, its time to stop that tanker with a non-violent human circle."
8235,LEELA,Why do we have to resort to non-violence? Can't we just kick their asses?
8236,WATERFALL SR,"Now little lady, those people's asses are living things too!"
8237,BENDER,Aye! We're hitched up tighter than Davy Jones' U-Haul! At ease men!
8238,FRY,I am at ease.
8239,BENDER,"Mr Fry. I like to give my first mate an informal nickname. From now on, you will be known as...Wiggles!"
8240,WIGGLES,The hell I will! Have you even read the captain's handbook?
8241,BENDER,I have now. And what's Peter Parrot's first rule of captaining?
8242,WIGGLES,Always respect the chain-o-command - captain.
8243,BENDER,Correct Wiggles. You've just earned an invitation to the captain's table.
8244,ZOIDBERG,(whispering) The captain's table! What an honour!
8245,WATERFALL SR,Our peace ring has 'em trapped like a tiger in a washing machine!
8246,LEELA,Get ready!
8247,PROTESTOR #1,Look out!
8248,PROTESTOR #2,Hold on!
8249,WATERFALL SR,Here they come.
8250,LEELA,"When you were planning this peace ring, didn't you realise spaceships can move in three dimensions?"
8251,WATERFALL SR,No I did not.
8252,WATERFALL SR,"Folks, that tanker gave us the slip but we'll stop 'em here on Pluto! If you're cold, rub your bodies with permafrost. It's nature's long johns.  If rubbing frozen dirt in your crotch is wrong, hey I don't wanna be right!"
8253,WATERFALL SR,This here is our penguin preserve.
8254,LEELA,Aww they're so cute! They're like if puppies and kittens could have babies!
8255,WATERFALL SR,We use hand puppets around young uns to simulate a natural environment.
8256,LEELA,That's adorable.
8257,BENDER,"...But I suppose it's this medal I'm most proud of Wiggles. I won it for saving the children of Earth from a giant kangaroo. It was on the Australian news, you probably didn't see it."
8258,ZOIDBERG,Brilliant!
8259,FRY,Would you cram a sock in it Bender? Those aren't even medals! They're bottlecaps and pepperoni slices.
8260,BENDER,Thank you steward. Wiggles? Weren't you about to propose a toast to your gallant captain?
8261,FRY,"Fine, I've got a toast. To Captain Bender! He's the best......at being a big jerk and his big ugly face is as dumb as a butt."
8262,BENDER,"Eh, I've heard better."
8263,FRY,If I were in charge I wouldn't treat you like this. You're nothing but a big blowhard.
8264,BENDER,"Sir, you forget yourself! Shut up!"
8265,FRY,Being captain is obviously more important to you than being my friend. I'm going.
8266,BENDER,"Going? But, a captain can't drink without his first mate!"
8267,ZOIDBERG,You can drink with me maybe?
8268,BENDER,I don't feel like drinking.
8269,ZOIDBERG,Then if you'll excuse me I see some ravioli that only has two shoeprints on it.  Three.
8270,BENDER,"(soberly singing) Oh Greenland is a barren land, a land that bears no green. Where there's ice and snow and the whale fishies blow and the -"
8271,ZOIDBERG,"Captain please, have some liquor. You robots need alcohol to function."
8272,BENDER,Gah! I once knew a guy...you look like him. But he wasn't either.  I'm a good captain.
8273,ZOIDBERG,"Please sir, I love you like a father!"
8274,PROTESTOR #3,"Here they come, oh I hope they read my sign!"
8275,LEELA,Bender's flying too low! And he's upside-down!
8276,PROTESTOR #3,He must be talking on a cell phone!
8277,FRY,What's happening?
8278,ZOIDBERG,All 6000 hulls have been breached!
8279,FRY,Oh the fools! If only they'd built it with 6001 hulls! When will they learn?
8280,LINDA [ON TV],Continuing our coverage of a tragic - but far away - story. The crisis on Pluto worsens as dark matter spreads throughout the penguin habitat. The images are truly horrific.
8281,LEELA [ON TV],"I don't think any of those poor, oil-drenched penguins feel."
8282,MORBO [ON TV],"Oily humanoid!  At the time of the crash, the tanker captain had an alcohol level of .08 percent - well below the legal limit for robots."
8283,HYPER-CHICKEN,"Son, as your lawyer I declare y'all are in a 12-piece bucket o' trouble. But I done struck you a deal; Five hours of community service cleanin' up that ole mess you caused."
8284,BENDER,Five hours? Aw man! Couldn't you have just gotten me the death penalty?
8285,HYPER-CHICKEN,I'd have done better but it's plum hard pleadin' a case while awaitin' trial for that there incompetance!
8286,BENDER,"Yeah, uh, good luck with that."
8287,LEELA,Now you stay away from those puffin twins.
8288,WATERFALL SR,Good way to avoid frostbite folks: Put your hands between your buttocks.  That's nature's pocket.
8289,LEELA,Uh...I think I'll go check on Bender.
8290,WATERFALL SR,Watch that he doesn't pick your pocket.
8291,BENDER,"Ah, can't beat fresh squeezed!"
8292,LEELA,"Bender, can you at least pretend you're being punished?  And clean the black parts too."
8293,SMITTY,Are they black with white feathers or white with black feathers?
8294,URL,"It don't matter baby, they're all beautiful!"
8295,BENDER,"Yo, screws, more Tegrin over here? Oh ho, what's this?"
8296,URL,"Aww man, he got away!"
8297,SMITTY,I guess this is why chief says no hugging.
8298,WATERFALL SR,"Good work everyone. I suggest you all go get some sleep. Me, well I'm gonna stay up all night singing songs about penguins in a fine piercing tenor."
8299,LEELA,Has anyone seen Bender? (shouting) Bender? Here robot robot robot.
8300,LEELA,"Hey, why weren't you Kong donkeys outside cleaning up?"
8301,ZOIDBERG,They sent us inside for doing an unsatisfactory job.  (sadly) And eating penguin eggs.
8302,FRY,"You ate most of them. So, where's Captain Bender? Off catastrophising some other planet?"
8303,ZOIDBERG,"Dammit Fry! He may have done wrong, but he's still your captain."
8304,LEELA,I'm worried about him. He didn't come back with the group.
8305,FRY,He didn't?
8306,LEELA,No. And with windchill it's 20 degrees below absolute zero. I'd better go find him.
8307,FRY,"Wait. Let me. Bender and I have our disagreements, but we're still friends and I'm gonna show him what that means. To the ship."
8308,LEELA,Why don't you just walk? He was only about 20 yards from here.
8309,FRY,"Madam, I am in command now."
8310,ZOIDBERG,Such a man. I'd follow him to hell and back I would.
8311,BENDER,What the?  What's this water made of? Ice? Forget this!
8312,PENGUIN #1,(in penguin) Full of fish?
8313,BENDER,(in penguin) Not entirely.
8314,PENGUIN #1,(in penguin) Then let's fish.
8315,ZOIDBERG,"Captain, I don't think we're on Pluto any longer. In fact, we may have left space as we know it."
8316,FRY,Then where are we? You said you knew how to navigate.
8317,ZOIDBERG,(shouting) Stop yelling at me!
8318,WATERFALL SR,"Folks it's worse than we thought. Seems dark matter is nature's sex drug. It's like a perverted trail mix of penguin estrogen, penguin Viagra and Spanish penguin fly. Why, it's making them ultra-fertile."
8319,LEELA,How ultra?
8320,WATERFALL SR,Well your garden variety penguin lays one egg a year. Since the spill our penguins have been laying six eggs every 15 minutes.  Also the eggs hatch in only 12 hours.  Also the males are laying eggs.
8321,DOCTOR,This man is over-gasped.
8322,WATERFALL SR,If the birds keep multiplying soon there'll be too many to count.  Before long they'll exhaust their food supply and starve to death.
8323,LEELA,"Oh if only we hadn't flown penguins to Pluto and dumped oil on them, this might never have happened. Can't we stop them from multiplying?"
8324,WATERFALL SR,Yes I reckon it is our responsibility. And thankfully we have a plan.
8325,LEELA,What is it? We'll do anything.
8326,WATERFALL SR,Everyone grab your guns. I declare penguin hunting season officially open.
8327,LEELA,You can't shoot penguins. Isn't there some way to prevent them from breeding?
8328,WATERFALL SR,Cold showers don't work on Antarctic creatures. Now surely you agree that a quick semi-painless death is a darn sight better than weeks of starvation.
8329,LEELA,"Well...I suppose...but...I mean...I joined Penguins Unlimited to love penguins, not to hunt them."
8330,WATERFALL SR,This time the two are one and the same! Now are you with us or are you gonna let innocent penguins suffer?
8331,LEELA,(crying) Oh God it's inhuman! It's like Hong Kong! I'll do it!
8332,WATERFALL SR,That's a good old fashioned gun. Simple point-and-click interface. Rifle check!
8333,HUNTER #1,Oh yeah!
8334,HUNTER #2,Wee doggy!
8335,LEELA,"Hey, you're enjoying this."
8336,WATERFALL SR,"Look nobody enjoys shooting penguins. But if you have to shoot penguins, well you might as well enjoy it."
8337,LEELA,I'm sorry but if it's fun in any way it's not environmentalism.
8338,WATERFALL SR,Oh really? How 'bout blowing up dams?
8339,LEELA,Yeah...that is fun.
8340,WATERFALL SR,Let's conservate!
8341,ZOIDBERG,(shouting; from ship) It's been an honour to serve under you sir!
8342,LEELA,"Alright, this is for their own good. Don't leave orphans. Gotta kill entire families.  But they're so cute. No! You can do this. It's just like murdering a little butler. I...I can't look. (crying) Oh no! What have I done?  Oh you poor little guy! I'm so sorry I - Bender?  What's going on? Were you hiding out with these little guys?"
8343,BENDER,Of course not. Filthy ice rats. Scat! Shoo!  Gah! What are you doing? Get away!
8344,LEELA,"Aww, they love you!"
8345,BENDER,"Well I don't love them.  Aww!  I don't know why but when I look down at their little faces, it makes me wanna puke! In a good way!"
8346,PENGUINS,(in penguin) Stand still. It's our only hope.
8347,BENDER,(in penguin) That's Puffin talk. Now follow me!
8348,LEELA,"Stop! Stop shooting! It's me, Leela."
8349,HUNTER #2,Sorry.
8350,WATERFALL SR,Why aren't you firing randomly into those birds little lady? Don't you wanna help 'em?
8351,LEELA,Not this way.
8352,WATERFALL SR,What? Why you're not a tree-hugging kook at all!
8353,LEELA,"Look, I don't know if shooting penguins will help the environment or not. But I do know that the decision shouldn't be in the hands of people who just wanna kill for fun."
8354,WATERFALL SR,"Leela, you may just be farming some free-range truth there.  On the other hand we just made up 200 pounds of batter for penguin tempura. OK boys, it's them or us!"
8355,LEELA,No!
8356,WATERFALL SR,Hey where'd they - ?
8357,BENDER,(shouting) Attack!
8358,HUNTER #1,Whoa!
8359,HUNTER #2,Ow!
8360,BENDER,(in penguin) We will fight them on the beaches! We will fight them on the glaciers!
8361,WATERFALL SR,(shouting) Make sure they use every part of my body!
8362,OLD MAN WATERFALL,(shouting) I'll avenge your death son!
8363,LEELA,They used to be such peaceful birds. I suppose this was your doing.
8364,BENDER,"Yep. It's like I taught 'em. If it ain't black and white - peck scratch and bite! Now to take off my tuxedo.  Guys, it's me! Your lovable dictator! Uh-oh!"
8365,LEELA,"Oh, if only we had a toboggan."
8366,BENDER,Faster! Faster!
8367,LEELA,Phew!
8368,BENDER,Oh phew!  Oh right they can swim. It's all coming back to me now.
8369,LEELA,It's Fry!
8370,BENDER,Wiggles?
8371,LEELA,"Well, at least it'll help reduce their population."
8372,BENDER,"Yeah, life is hilariously cruel.  Permission to come aboard Wiggles?"
8373,FRY,Granted. We can't take off without our captain.
8374,BENDER,"Oh, and bring my toboggan."
8375,FRY,"So Leela, were you able to help the penguins?"
8376,LEELA,Well sure. I mean...not really...I mean...nature will work itself out. It can't screw things up any worse than we did trying to fix things right?
8377,FRY,(mumbling) I 'unno.
8378,BENDER,"Ah, quit your worrying. Thanks to my shining influence those stupid birds'll do just fine."
8379,THE END,
8380,"""LUCK OF THE FRYRISH""",
8381,DOCTOR,"Push Mrs Fry, push!"
8382,MR FRY,You can do it honey! Squeeze one out for America!
8383,MRS FRY,(shouting) Hey keep it down it's the 9th inning!
8384,MRS FRY,Swing the bat you bum!
8385,DOCTOR,It's a boy. And look at that red hair.
8386,MR FRY,You sayin' my son's a commie?
8387,MRS FRY,This is the happiest day of my life!
8388,DOCTOR,Here's your baby ma'am.
8389,MRS FRY,Yeah OK thanks.
8390,MR FRY,"So, what should we name him?"
8391,MRS FRY,"Uh, you pick. I picked dinner last night."
8392,MR FRY,"Well, I was thinking Philip. After those screwdrivers?"
8393,MRS FRY,That's a fantastic idea. More morphine please.
8394,MR FRY,"Look Yancy, its your baby brother Philip."
8395,YANCY,I wanna be named Philip! Me Philip! Me Philip!
8396,MR FRY,"Son your name is Yancy, just like me and my grandfather and so on. All the way back to minuteman Yancy Fry, who blasted commies in the American Revolution. Philip, until I find a suitable model of an ICBM you'll have to make do learnin' to fear this toy spacecraft."
8397,YANCY,Mine! Mine!
8398,FRY,(shouting) C'mon!
8399,HERMES,(shouting) Baby needs a new pair of shoes!
8400,ZOIDBERG,"To hell with your spoiled baby, I need those shoes!"
8401,FARNSWORTH,No fair! You changed the outcome by measuring it.
8402,LEELA,How'd you do Fry?
8403,FRY,I'll tell you when my horse finishes...bad.
8404,MR WONG,In today's field we own four horses and two jockeys.
8405,MRS WONG,"We just put our best jockey out to stud Amy, he's perfect for you!"
8406,JOCKEY,"Hey baby, ever do it in a suitcase?"
8407,BENDER,Ooo look! It's the centaur race!
8408,FRY,"Come on, come on! Hey Leela, how 'bout a kiss for good luck?  I meant tongue luck."
8409,FRY,I am so unlucky! I've run over black cats that were luckier than me.
8410,MAN,"Get your piping hot horse burgers, horse fries, horse cake and shakes. We got tongue straight from the horse's mouth."
8411,LEELA,Hmm.
8412,HERMES,It all sounds good.
8413,MAN,All our horses are 100% horse fed for that double juiced in horse goodness.
8414,LEELA,I'll have a cholesterol free omelette with horse beaters.
8415,MAN,"And you sir, how can I horse you?"
8416,HERMES,I'll have a horse coke.
8417,MAN,Horse Pepsi OK?
8418,HERMES,Neigh.
8419,JOCKEY,Hey what are you doing?
8420,BENDER,This.
8421,FRY,"Dear Horse God, I know I don't usually pray to you, sometimes I doubt you even exist. But if you're willing to grant me luck, please, stamp your hoof once. Come on number six move it!  Don't do that! What are you -  Man it's contagious!"
8422,BENDER,That'll teach those other horses to take drugs!
8423,FRY,"That's it! You can only take my money for so long before you take it all, and I say enough.  I've got one dollar left, and this one I'm holding onto! Oh no you don't!  I may not know much about horses but I know a lot about doing anything for one dollar!  If you think bad luck can defeat me then you don't know my name is Philip J -"
8424,MAN,That is one unlucky guy!
8425,FRY,Kareem's got the skyhook but Philip J. Fry's got the spacehook!
8426,YANCY,"Yancy drives, he goes up with his patented spacehook!"
8427,FRY,Hey. That's my patented spacehook! You stole it!
8428,YANCY,You're not the president of it!
8429,FRY,Holy camolie! A seven leaf clover!
8430,YANCY,(shouting) I'm dying of old age!
8431,FRY,Phil wins! Yancy's fans are stunned! There'll be no celebration at the Yancy dome!
8432,YANCY,Lucky.
8433,LEELA,Well someone's in a good mode.
8434,BENDER,Let's just say I lucked out at the track! Also I rigged one race.
8435,FRY,Pah. I'd have won a lot of money too if I still had my lucky seven leaf clover. Plus I'd still have my hair.
8436,HAIRBOT,"I got your page Mr Fry, your new hair is ready!"
8437,AMY,So whatever happened to this seven leaf clover?
8438,FRY,I hid it in a secret hiding place who's location I never told anyone. Not even Scruffy.
8439,ZOIDBERG,So the clover is still in the hiding place maybe?
8440,FRY,Hey yeah! Maybe it is still there! Underground in the ruins of Old New York. Helping some ant defeat another ant or helping some piece of dirt turn it's luck around.
8441,FARNSWORTH,Dirt doesn't need luck.
8442,FRY,I'm going down there to get my clover back. Now some of the tunnels have metal bars so I'll need someone who's good at bending. Leela how 'bout you?
8443,LEELA,Sure I'll do it.
8444,BENDER,Like hell you will. Bending's my middle name.
8445,FRY,It is?
8446,BENDER,Yep. My full name is Bender Bending Rodriguez
8447,FRY,Here's the entrance.  From this moment on I declare my bad luck officially over.
8448,BENDER,He was fun.
8449,LEELA,Well if we get bored I've got Tetris on this thing.
8450,FRY,"Look, up ahead."
8451,BENDER,Old New York. The city that inspired a casino in Las Vegas.
8452,FRY,"Wow! We've got Manhattan all to ourselves! I can finally do all the crazy stuff I always dreamed of doing!  Howard Stern s overrated!  Uh, oops!"
8453,BENDER,New York is so burned.
8454,FRY,And remember when Mayor Giuliani cracked down on jaywalking?
8455,LEELA,No.
8456,FRY,"Well Rudy, how'd you like this action?"
8457,GUY #1,"As you know the big breakdance is Saturday. So if we wanna win those Jam Master J autographed parachute pants our crew has to pop, lock and bust the freshest. Noticwably F.A.T., drop us a beat. Name?"
8458,FRY,Cosmic F.
8459,GUY #1,Style?
8460,FRY,Outer space.
8461,GUY #1,Special moves?
8462,FRY,The moonwalk...the robot...the zero
8463,GUY #1,Name?
8464,YANCY,Cosmic Y.
8465,GUY #1,Style?
8466,YANCY,"Uh, deep space!"
8467,FRY,Deep space??
8468,GUY #1,Special moves?
8469,YANCY,The spacewalk...
8470,FRY,Hey!
8471,YANCY,...The robot...
8472,FRY,The robot? That's similar to mine!
8473,YANCY,The zero G!
8474,FRY,What are you doing? You totally ripped off my routine.
8475,YANCY,You callin' me a biter?
8476,FRY,Why do you always have to steal everything from me Yancy? Find your own life and live it.
8477,YANCY,Stop illin'! Word!
8478,FRY,Well I'd like to see you try and steal this. the septuple head spin.
8479,YANCY,He's just scratching. No one's ever done more than a quadruple.
8480,FRY,"Oh yeah? Noticeably F.A.T., rewind the tape."
8481,GUY #1,Crazy sucker!
8482,GUY #2,"Phil, you're hot!"
8483,NOTICEABLY F.A.T.,That was ice cold bro!
8484,GUY #1,"Fry if I ever see you try anything that crazy again, this crew might just have some new parachute pants!"
8485,YANCY,Stop hogging the clover.
8486,FRY,"Alright team, let's go find that clover!"
8487,LEELA,Which way to your house? The sign says we're at 71st street.
8488,FRY,"71st street? Hmm, never heard of it. Downtown could be in any direction."
8489,BENDER,"No sweat, we'll just take a spin on the B-train!"
8490,BENDER,Ooo that feels funny!  This is the Brooklyn bound B-train making local stops at wherever the hell I feel like. Watch for the closing doors.
8491,BENDER,Wake up buddy end of the line!
8492,FRY,"Gosh my old neighbourhood!  That's the bench where I found some shirts!  That fire hydrant! In summer we'd light it on fire! On that corner, some guy with a bushy beard handed out a socialist newsletter!"
8493,BENDER,Was it poorly xeroxed?
8494,FRY,You'd better believe it!
8495,LEELA,"The old comedians were right, this place is a lot different from LA!"
8496,MUTANT,Pardon me but did I overhear you saying you used to live here?
8497,FRY,That's right.
8498,MUTANT,Did you know Andy Goldman?
8499,FRY,"Yeah, he was my neighbour. Why?"
8500,MUTANT,I mutated from him!
8501,FRY,Get out of here! What's Andy up to these days?
8502,ANDY,The short answer is I'm teaching.
8503,LEELA,He seemed nice.
8504,FRY,Sure when he's sober!
8505,FRY,Holy camolies! The house I grew up in! It's still there!
8506,BENDER,"Man, father time really took a bat to this place."
8507,YANCY,That stupid clover is a worthless piece of garbage! Give it give it give it!
8508,FRY,Mom! Help!
8509,MRS FRY,Yes!
8510,FRY,"Mom, Yancy's trying to steal my clover."
8511,MRS FRY,"(uninterested) Yancy, stealing is wrong."
8512,YANCY,I'm gonna pile drive you!  You're dead meat!
8513,MR FRY,What's happenin' up there? Did Kremlin Joe let fly with the nukes?
8514,FRY,Not yet commander. Yancy's just trying to steal my stuff as usual.
8515,MR FRY,Well he'd better keep his hands off these bananas. Gonna need them when the radiation turns us all into monkeys.
8516,FRY,The Ronco Record Vault! Yancy'll never get his hands on you in here or my money back.  Ah The Breakfast Club soundtrack! Man I can't wait til I'm old enough to feel ways about stuff!  Stay safe clover. I may need you again someday.
8517,FRY,This was the storage room. My dad spent years turning it into a bomb shelter.
8518,LEELA,And yet you guys never had a single nuclear war.
8519,BENDER,What a waste.
8520,FRY,This is it! My Ronco Record Vault! I still remember the combination.  Three. It's stuck.
8521,BENDER,The Achilles heel of the Ronco design is it's structural resonance frequency. Allow me.  There we go!
8522,FRY,Here it is. The Breakfast Club soundtrack.
8523,BENDER,You mean breakfast club sandwich?
8524,FRY,I hid my seven leaf clover in this very record jacket so my brother Yancy wouldn't get it.  Here goes.  It's gone!  the whole place has been cleaned out! Yancy stole my clover! That thief!
8525,LEELA,How do you know it didn't disintergrate?
8526,FRY,Everything else in here held up OK.
8527,BENDER,Except Sports by Huey Lewis.
8528,FRY,I don't know why my brother hated me so much.
8529,LEELA,"Aw, brothers always fight. I'm sure deep down he loved you. He just never got a chance to say it before you got frozen."
8530,FRY,You think? 'Cause I always kinda wished that -
8531,BENDER,Who is that God-like figure?
8532,FRY,It's my brother Yancy! And there in his lapel - my seven leaf clover! I knew he stole it.
8533,LEELA,Hold the phone. If that's Yancy then why does the inscription read Philip J. Fry?
8534,FRY,Wait a second! That's my name! Good Lord. He ditched his goofy name and stole mine!
8535,BENDER,"Apparently this brave adonis, this cadillac of men, was the first person on Mars."
8536,FRY,"First person on Mars?? I should have been the first person on Mars! He stole my clover, he stole my name and he stole my life!  And now he broke my hand."
8537,BENDER,His legend lives on.
8538,FARNSWORTH,So you opened the record vault and the clover was gone?
8539,BENDER,"Yep, nothing in there but all the best music of the 1980's in one amazing collection."
8540,LEELA,"Survivor, Pat Benetar, The Scorpions. The list goes on."
8541,FRY,That clover helped my ratfink brother steal my dream of going into space. Now I'll never get there.
8542,LEELA,You went there this morning for doughnuts.
8543,HERMES,First person on Mars? Oh so your brother was that Philip J. Fry!
8544,FRY,I'm Philip J. Fry! He stole my name after I got frozen.
8545,FARNSWORTH,"Shut up friends. My internet browser heard us saying the word ""Fry"" and it found a movie about Philip J. Fry for us.  It alwso opened my calendar to Friday and ordered me some French fries."
8546,FRY,That should have been me!
8547,FRY,That's my clover! Yancy stole it!
8548,FRY,That's what I'm known for!
8549,MAN [IN MOVIE],"Phil came in right, sturmmed out this tune yeah. And I said ""That's a number one record!"""
8550,FRY,"So that's where my clover is? Hey, is that orbitting cemetary near here?"
8551,LEELA,It will be in a couple hours.
8552,FRY,"Good. Leela, Bender, we're going graverobbing."
8553,BENDER,I'll get my kit.
8554,YANCY,Thanks for lending me your tux Dad. It'll be perfect for my wedding.
8555,MR FRY,"Yancy, that tux got me through Nam in style!  I just wish your brother were still around to see this."
8556,MRS FRY,I'll never forget the day Philip disappeared. Wisconsin won the rose bowl 17-9. Oh I miss him.
8557,YANCY,Oh that reminds me. I was thinking of rummaging through Phil's records for something to play at the wedding.
8558,MRS FRY,Have a look downstairs. Your brother may be missing but his crap sure isn't.
8559,YANCY,"Hmm Breakfast Club, this'll clear out the room at the end of the reception."
8560,LEELA,They buried your brother in the world heroes section? I'm impressed.
8561,FRY,I should be the one in that grave!
8562,FRY,Hmm. We lost Bender.
8563,BENDER,There. Now no one will be able to say I don't own John Larroquette's spine!
8564,FRY,Aha! My brother's grave!
8565,LEELA,"(reading) Philip Fry, the original Martian."
8566,FRY,"It's all lies every word of it! He wasn't original, he wasn't a Martian, he wasn't Philip Fry and since when is he a the?"
8567,BENDER,You're twice the the he ever was.
8568,FRY,It's clovering time!
8569,YANCY'S WIFE,"So, had any ideas for names Yancy?"
8570,YANCY,"Uh, I'm sorta thinking one.  Daddy has a present for you today. Do you know what it is?  It's a lucky clover that can help you be successful at anything you do - even breakdancing - and it once belonged to someone very special."
8571,YANCY'S WIFE,I know what name you wanna give him Yancy. It's OK.
8572,YANCY,"Really?  Son, I'm naming you Philip J. Fry in honour of my little brother, who I miss every day. I love you Philip, and I always will."
8573,FRY,"(reading) Here lies Philip J. Fry, named for his uncle, to carry on his spirit."
8574,BENDER,"Pay dirt! I got the clover! Plus his wedding ring.  Sorry ladies, I'm taken! Hey Fry you want me to smack the corpse up a little?"
8575,LEELA,"Uh, Bender, I think Fry needs a moment alone."
8576,BENDER,Alright grab a shovel. I'm only one skull short of a Mouseketeer reunion.
8577,THE END,

8581,LEELA,"It's a doorbell baby!  Hello, little guy. You know, I was abandoned as a baby too, so --"
8582,BENDER,"Garbage, huh? I'll take care of it."
8583,LEELA,"Bender, stop! It's a baby!"
8584,BENDER,A baby what?  Ow!
8585,LEELA,"Oh, it's just a card -- from the orphanarium I grew up in."
8586,CARD,"Leela, you're invited to reunion at Cookieville Minimum-Security Orphanarium. Please stand clear of self-destructing basket."
8587,BENDER,"A reunion at your old orphanarium, eh? You gonna go?"
8588,LEELA,"No way, jose-bot. I never wanna see those other orphans again! Not after the way they used to pick on me."

8592,KIRK,"My eyes may not work, but at least I got two of them!"
8593,FRY,"Aww. That's terrible, Leela. But imagine the look on their faces when you show up with two friends who eat all the hors d'oeuvres."
8594,LEELA,"Well, I wouldn't mind rubbing my success in a few choice faces."
8595,BENDER,Set a course for adventure!
8596,FRY,Eww!
8597,BENDER,What a dump!
8598,LEELA,Just like old times. Gosh. The bars on the windows seemed so much thicker back then.  Mr. Vogel? Remember me?
8599,VOGEL,Leela! You're worthless and no one will ever love you!
8600,LEELA,You used to say that all the time!
8601,VOGEL,"Oh, those were happier days."
8602,FRY,Mmm! The gristle-in-a-blanket isn't half bad.
8603,BENDER,Mmm! And try one of these Popsicle sticks. They've absorbed quite a bit of flavour.
8604,LEELA,"Hey, look. It's our old group picture."
8605,FRY,I don't see you anywhere.
8606,LEELA,That's me over in Cootietown.
8607,BENDER,Whoa! Get a load of this average-looking guy!
8608,LEELA,That's Adlai Atkins. I used to have kind of a crush on him.
8609,KIDS,(chanting) One-eye! One-eye!
8610,FRENCH GUY,Stupid as a French guy!
8611,KIDS,(chanting) One-eye! One-eye! One-eye! One-eye! One-eye! One-eye! One-eye! One-eye!
8612,LEELA,"Well, it's time to say hello to the old gang."
8613,MAN #1,"So, watcha been up to since you left the orphanarium?"
8614,MAN #2,"Uh, living in a box, fighting the shakes. You?"
8615,MAN #1,"Selling kidneys, teeth; whatever falls out of me."
8616,LEELA,"And what am I up to, you ask? Well I'm a very successful space captain."
8617,MAN #2,Oh.
8618,MAN #1,Wow.
8619,MAN #3,"How nice for you, Leela."
8620,WOMAN,(patronising) That's so good for a person with one eye.
8621,LEELA,Hey! You can't feel sorry for me! I'm a space captain and you're all a bunch of losers.
8622,MAN #1,"Uh, right, right. We're the losers!"
8623,KIRK,"Well, if it isn't old one-eye!"
8624,LEELA,"Oh, yeah? Well, shut up, cane boy!"
8625,MAN #3,He can't hear you. He's deaf now.
8626,ADLAI,"Leave Leela alone. She's leading a perfectly normal life. She's not gussied up, duded out, getting down or where it's at. Now, run along."
8627,LEELA,"Thanks, Adlai. I guess you never really outgrow being an eyeball -- oddball!"
8628,ADLAI,"Nonsense. You're a space captain. That's a fine, conventional profession."
8629,LEELA,"Well, you know. It's just for a package delivery service."
8630,ADLAI,Ah-ah. A package is just a box until it's delivered.
8631,LEELA,Huh. I'd never thought of it that way. So what do you do these days?
8632,ADLAI,"Oh, I'm a doctor."
8633,LEELA,"A tall doctor, you say?"
8634,VOGEL,"Sir, you seem pretty stable. Have you thought about adopting one of our kids?"
8635,FRY,Sure haven't.
8636,VOGEL,Well keep adoption in mind. It's a great way to have kids without having sex.
8637,FRY,(thoughtful) Really?
8638,VOGEL,"Plus, the government will help out with a small stipend of $100 a week."
8639,BENDER,$100 a week?
8640,ADLAI,I'm so sorry I teased you back then. Let me make it up to you. I can fix it so that no one ever makes fun of you again.
8641,LEELA,You mean by beating them up? Because I've broken that blind kid's nose like 10 times and it doesn't make any difference.
8642,ADLAI,"No, I specialise in phaser eye surgery. I can build you a paraffin eye and graft it on with skin from your foot. It won't be able to see but you'll look like a perfectly normal two-eyed person."
8643,LEELA,Me? Perfectly normal?
8644,BENDER,"Sons, daughters, meet Uncle Fry."
8645,FRY,"Hey, why are those kids following you? Do you have candy stuck to your ass?"
8646,BENDER,"No. It's called parenting. Come on, dumplings. We've got 12 government stipends to collect."
8647,KIDS,(cheering) Yay!
8648,BOY,Our daddy's a giant toy!
8649,FARNSWORTH,Phaser eye surgery is a capital idea. I'm sure Leela's tired of morons gaping at her eye all the time.
8650,AMY,"I think cosmetic surgery's great, Leela. I used to be too cute, so I had cuteness-reduction surgery here......and here."
8651,FRY,You guys are crazy. Leela doesn't need surgery. You look great the way you are.
8652,LEELA,"Oh, that's so sweet, Fry. But for once in my life, I just wanna look normal."
8653,FRY,"But you're better than normal, you're abnormal. If you ask me, you shouldn't care what other people think."
8654,LEELA,You're right! I'll start by not caring what you think!  I'm getting the surgery.
8655,FARNSWORTH,Thatagirl!
8656,AMY,Right on!
8657,ZOIDBERG,"Wonderful. And while you're under the knife, you could also get an ink pouch to help you escape your enemies."
8658,FARNSWORTH,That's the stupidest idea I've ever heard you imbecile!
8659,ADLAI,"Now we'll find out if the operation was a success. Hold on to your hats. Oh, I'm sorry, this is the wrong patient. Oops."
8660,AMY,"Leela, those eyes look so great on you."
8661,FRY,Bah! I think she looked fine before.
8662,FARNSWORTH,No.
8663,AMY,Uh-uh.
8664,HERMES,Wrong.
8665,LEELA,"Wow, look at me. Although I don't have the hang of blinking yet."
8666,ADLAI,"You'll get it. Personally, I try not to blink too much because it seems flashy. But when I do, I enjoy it."
8667,LEELA,I did it! I blunk!
8668,HERMES,And just in time to screw up this picture I took!
8669,LEELA,Hooray!
8670,WALT,Ow!
8671,IGNER,Ow!
8672,LARRY,Ow!
8673,LEELA,I've never felt so unremarkable! Today I actually blended in with a crowd!
8674,BENDER,"Kids, meet the jerkbags I work with."
8675,KIDS,"(chanting) Hello, jerkbags!"
8676,AMY,"Oh, they're so cute! What are their names?"
8677,BENDER,Kids have names?
8678,NINA,"My name's Nina, and his name's Albert --"
8679,BENDER,"And from now on, you're all named Bender Jr.!  Looky here! My first government stipend cheque! 12 baby humans, 1200 wing-wangs!"
8680,SALLY,"Daddy Bender, we're hungry."
8681,BENDER,"What is it with you kids? Every other day, it's food, food, food!  Oh, fine. I'll get you some stupid food."
8682,ALBERT,Can we have Bender burgers again?
8683,BENDER,No. The cat shelter's on to me!
8684,ADLAI,"Hello, Leela. I was in a nearby tailor getting one of my Hawaiian shirts toned down, so I thought I'd drop in for your follow-up exam."
8685,LEELA,That's so handsome of you.
8686,ADLAI,"Just follow the light with your eyes. Perfect! You know, a guy could fall head-over-heels for a gal like you. As for me, I'm somewhat interested myself."
8687,LEELA,What are you saying?
8688,ADLAI,"I've never been good with words, which is why I'm in such a delicate conundrum. Will you go out with me this Sunday?"
8689,LEELA,Sure!
8690,ADLAI,"I don't know what else to say, so I'll just say it. Okey-dokey, see you then."
8691,FRY,This is so unfair! I liked you back when you were a cyclops! That guy's only interested now that you have two eyes.
8692,LEELA,You're just jealous!
8693,FRY,"No, I'm not! Oh, wait, I am. But my point remains valid!"
8694,LEELA,"Fry, I just wanna try dating a normal man, who if you go somewhere with him no one says he's crummy. I think I deserve that once in life."
8695,ZOIDBERG,"Be careful with Adlai, Leela, he's a doctor, they're very poor."
8696,LEELA,"Actually, most doctors are rich."
8697,ZOIDBERG,"What? When did this happen? You're joking, right?  That's not funny!"
8698,BENDER,"OK, they've got everything you need here: Booze, a couple of peanuts, they got a crapper in the back -- that's one of the things you kids do, right?"
8699,ALBERT,Yeah.
8700,BENDER,Then knock yourself out.  Hey! Hey! Only eat enough to barely keep yourselves alive! I'm trying to make a profit here.
8701,NINA,Daddy! Bethany's hitting me!
8702,BENDER,Here.
8703,FEMBOT,These kids yours?
8704,BENDER,Yeah.
8705,FEMBOT,Ooh. I'm attracted to a man with responsibility!
8706,BENDER,"That's me, baby! Let me just ditch the kids in an alley and we can go have some fun."
8707,BOY,Daddy Bender?
8708,BENDER,"Son, daddy's trying to score with a cheap floozy right now, so we need you to cram a Tinkertoy in it!"
8709,BOY,"I love you, Daddy Bender!"
8710,BENDER,"Hey, what the hell are you doing? Quit hugging me!"
8711,FEMBOT,I guess you're busy. I'll catch you later.
8712,BENDER,You morons! I don't know what you're trying to pull here but I got half a mind to hug each and every one of you and see how you like it!
8713,KIDS,(cheering) Yay!
8714,BENDER,"(grumbling) Oh, come on!"
8715,ADLAI,I thought I'd take you someplace ordinary -- a place no one could object to.
8716,LEELA,That sounds wonderful.
8717,MAN,I'd like and extra-beautiful bouquet for my extra-gorgeous sweetheart.
8718,ADLAI,"Average, please."
8719,LEELA,"Oh, Adlai, I've had a wonderful time today. No one's stared at me or avoided staring at me or tried to burn me. You make me feel so not weird."
8720,ADLAI,"Leela, you're 999,999 in a million!"
8721,LEELA,Thanks for coming out to get to know my boyfriend. Isn't he dreamy?
8722,ZOIDBERG,(mesmerised) Totally.
8723,ADLAI,"Uh, listen: I just want you all to know your Leela's one standard lady."
8724,LEELA,"Oh, Adlai, stop!"
8725,FRY,What's so wonderful about Leela being normal? The rest of us aren't normal and that's what makes us great. Like Dr. Zoidberg: He's a weird monster who smells like he eats garbage and does.
8726,ZOIDBERG,Damn right!
8727,FRY,"And the professor's a senile, amoral crackpot.  Hermes is a Rastafarian accountant."
8728,HERMES,Tally me banana.
8729,FRY,Amy's a klutz from Mars.
8730,AMY,Sploops!
8731,FARNSWORTH,"And Fry, you've got that brain thing."
8732,FRY,"I already did! So, Leela, do you wanna be like us? Or do you wanna be like Adlai with no severe mental or social problems whatsoever?"
8733,LEELA,That's the dumbest question I ever heard!
8734,FARNSWORTH,She's right!
8735,ZOIDBERG,No doubt about it.
8736,AMY,Duh!
8737,HERMES,Daylight come!
8738,BENDER,"Coming through, watch your heads!"
8739,ZOIDBERG,Help! I'm under attack!
8740,BENDER,"Remember your manners, kids. Forks go in the left pocket, spoons in the right."
8741,ELZAR,Which one of you cutie muffins gets the children's spicy squab?
8742,LITTLE BOY,Me!
8743,BENDER,Ah-ah-ah! What do we say when someone gives you something?
8744,LITTLE BOY,'Bout time!
8745,BENDER,That's my boy!
8746,ELZAR,And here's your check. Bam!
8747,ALBERT,I gotta go poopy!
8748,BENDER,"Well you should've gone poopy before it was time to run out on the check! C'mon! Go, go! Through the kitchen!"
8749,ELZAR,(shouting) You little crooks! If I catch you I'm going to make cutie-muffin gumbo!
8750,ADLAI,"You know, seeing that strange robot force 12 children to do his bidding makes me think about kids of our own."
8751,LEELA,Us? Me? You? Kids?
8752,ADLAI,"That's correct. It's time to stop living this vida bachelor loca, settle down and have kids."
8753,LEELA,"Oh, Adlai, this is the most beautiful moment of my life!"
8754,ALBERT,"Daddy Bender, I want a piggy back ride."
8755,BENDER,Daddy's tired. Let's just have another dog pile on Fry.
8756,SALLY,"Tell us a story, Daddy Bender."
8757,KIDS,(chanting) Story! Story! Story!
8758,BENDER,"Alright, fine, gather round."
8759,NINA,We wanna hear this one again!
8760,BENDER,"(reading) ""Bender's Arrest Record"" by the police. On March 3rd at 2pm, Bender was caught shoplifting!"
8761,ALBERT,"Yeah, show us the picture!  There he is!"
8762,BENDER,"OK, kids. It's 9:00, you know what that means. Daddy's sick of looking at you so go to bed.  The grown-ups have to talk. Come on, Ma."
8763,BENDER,"Now to figure out how much money I'm raking in off those twerps!  Oh, I need a calculator."
8764,FRY,You are a calculator.
8765,BENDER,"I mean a good calculator. Minus the food, the bunny rabbit wallpaper -- I'm getting 100 bucks a kid and they're costing 110!"
8766,FRY,There goes my new kitchen cabinets.
8767,BENDER,I'm not sitting through one more PTA meeting. The kids have got to go!
8768,LITTLE BOY,"Daddy, how do I flush you?"
8769,BENDER,(shouting) Just go to bed!
8770,ADLAI,"You know, doing this jigsaw puzzle of a pacifier factory makes me want to have children with you all the more."
8771,LEELA,"Adlai, I was thinking. Since we're both orphans, maybe we should adopt a child."
8772,ADLAI,"Adoption? Yes, that's acceptable. Heck, it's more than acceptable. It's adequately satisfactory!"
8773,BENDER,"Hello? Imperial Dragon Restaurant? I've got a herd of you-know-whats for sale...Let me check.  Oh, aren't you a cutie? About 35lbs.  What?!"
8774,LEELA,"Hi, Bender. We'd like to adopt a child."
8775,BENDER,"Well, you've come to the right place because Honest Bender's Orphanarium means discount orphans. Now, little lady. What do I have to do to send you home with 12 orphans today?"
8776,ADLAI,"Uh, I'm afraid we only want one."
8777,BENDER,"Whatever you say, chief. I'll show you what I got in stock."
8778,LEELA,I remember this from when we were kids: The warden would trot you out in front of prospective parents and they'd judge you like a piece of meat.
8779,ALBERT,I'm Albert.
8780,LEELA,Kind of fatty.
8781,BENDER,Then how about this little number? Pure-bred human. No vampire in there.
8782,LEELA,"Uh, um."
8783,ADLAI,Hmm.
8784,BENDER,"If you're strapped for cash, you might wanna consider this irregular unit. Cursed with a third ear but so full of that emotion that I understand is called ""love""."
8785,SALLY,"One time, I did a hundred jump ropes."
8786,LEELA,"Oh, I can't decide. We're gonna have to think about it."
8787,BENDER,"OK, kids, grown-ups gotta talk, time for bed."
8788,ALBERT,But it's 10 in the morning!
8789,BENDER,I said hit the hay!
8790,LEELA,"Oh, they're all so adorable."
8791,BENDER,"Yeah. You know, it's times like this I can hardly bear to let them go. Goodnight, you princes of Maine, you kings of New New England."
8792,SMITTY,"You're under arrest for child cruelty, child endangerment, depriving children of food, selling children as food and misrepresenting the weight of livestock."
8793,LEELA,"Officer, would it be alright if we adopted one of the kids?"
8794,SMITTY,Might as well. They're just gonna rot in the evidence locker.
8795,KID #1,Nice ear!
8796,KID #2,"Hey, freaky ears!"
8797,KID #3,How's you ear?
8798,LEELA,I've made up my mind. Let's adopt her.
8799,ADLAI,Her? But there's plenty of normal ones.
8800,LEELA,"Come on, Adlai. She could really use a mom and dad."
8801,KIDS,(chanting) Ear-face! Ear-face! Sally won the ugly race!
8802,ADLAI,"On the other hand, the children bring up a good point. She does have an ear on her face."
8803,LEELA,Well? So what? She may be different but she still deserves a good home.
8804,ADLAI,"Oh, alright. If you really want that one, I can give her an operation to make her acceptable."
8805,LEELA,She doesn't need an operation! She's fine the way she is!
8806,ADLAI,"Oh, and I suppose you were fine the way you were?"
8807,LEELA,Damn right I was!
8808,FRY,Yay!
8809,LEELA,"Shut up, Fry. Now look, Adlai. I'm proud to be different. And I just wished I'd realised that when I was her age."
8810,SALLY,I also have a tail!
8811,LEELA,Now take me to the hospital and put my eye back the way it was. Right now!
8812,ADLAI,Why should I do that?
8813,LEELA,"Listen, buddy. By the end of the day, one of us is going to have one eye."
8814,VOGEL,"In recognition of Bender's generous gift of 12 orphans and a government cheque for 1200 wing-wangs, I hereby rename this building the Bender B. Rodriguez Orphanarium!"
8815,FRY,It's good to have the old weird-looking Leela back.
8816,LEELA,"Aww! You're a true friend, Fry. I guess there's nothing wrong with being a little weird."
8817,FRY,"Leela, there's nothing wrong with anything."
8818,ALBERT,"We'll miss you, Daddy Bender."
8819,NINA,We know robots don't have emotions but we drawed you this picture!
8820,SALLY,"So if you ever miss us, even just a teeny bit, you can look at it."
8821,BENDER,"Hey, I smoke a cigar, not a candy cane. Sheesh!  Hey, what the? Get away! Come on! I just got all the gum off of there! Hey! Hey! (shouting) I hate you! I hate you all!"

8833,ZOIDBERG,You kept track of it all these years!
8834,FRY,"Oh, no, I'm boned! I haven't paid into the pension either. What'll I do when I retire?"
8835,BENDER,I thought you were retired.
8836,FRY,"Hey, I don't see you planning for your old age."
8837,BENDER,"I got plans. I'm gonna turn my on/off switch to ""off""."
8838,FRY,Well I'm gonna take action. It's time to check on my retirement fund.  Damn! Still only $100.
8839,FRANKLIN,"(on bill) A penny saved is a penny earned. Also, could you get some athlete's foot cream for my face?"
8840,FRY,He's right! I've gotta start investing wisely.

8849,BENDER,You old lunatic! How you been?
8850,ROBERTO,"Not bad, not bad.  Everybody on the floor! This is a stick-up!"
8851,BENDER,"Yeah, I'm doing OK too.  I'm taking a Chinese cooking class at the Learning Annex."
8852,ROBERTO,Cool. Ca-Can you give me a hand here?
8853,BENDER,"Sure thing, pal."
8854,ROBERTO,"Hey, you! Red!  Quit watering that plant and get the door!"

8860,BAILLIF,Court is in session. The Honourable Judge Whitey presiding.
8861,WHITEY,"The charge is bank robbery. Now, my caddie chauffeur informs me that a bank is a place where people put money that isn't properly invested. Therefore, robbing a bank is tantamount to that most heinous of crimes: Theft of money!"
8862,HYPER-CHICKEN,"As the surveillance camera for the bank what all the judge was a-jawing about, could ya'll tell us what you done seen the day of the crime?"
8863,CAMERA,"Well, let's see. My memory's a little fuzzy, but it went exactly like this:"
8864,HYPER-CHICKEN,"Your Honour, I move that I be disbarred for introducing this evidence against my own clients."
8865,HYPER-CHICKEN,"Mr. Fry, do you recognise the robot a-huggin' on you in this here hologram?"
8866,FRY,I sure do! That's the real robber and I'll never forget his name as long as I live. And that name is--
8867,LEELA,(shouting) Fry! Just give a name. You don't wanna look stupid on Court TV!
8868,FRY,You're right. You're right. It was--
8869,WHITEY,Yes? What? You say if I testify I'll be killed? Oh. It's for you.
8870,ROBERTO,...and the other hamburger will...
8871,ROBERTO,"...also be made of your lungs. So long, pal."
8872,FRY,I refuse to testify on the grounds that my organs will be chopped up into a patté.
8873,WHITEY,"Ah, the 67th Amendment."
8874,HYPER-CHICKEN,I may be a simple country Hyper-Chicken but I know when we're finger-licked. Whattya say we plead insanity?
8875,BENDER,A few months in an insane asylum? I could do that standing on my head.
8876,HYPER-CHICKEN,"If you start now, it might help our case."
8877,WHITEY,"Counselor, what evidence do you offer to support this new plea of insanity?"
8878,HYPER-CHICKEN,"Well, for one, they done hired me to represent them."
8879,WHITEY,"Insanity plea is accepted. Mr. Bender, I hereby commit you to the asylum for criminally insane robots until such time as you are deemed cured."
8880,BENDER,Yahoo! The system fails again!
8881,WHITEY,"And, Mr. Fry, I sentence you to the home for criminally insane humans."
8882,BAILIFF,"Your Honour, that facility has been full ever since you ruled that being poor is a mental illness."
8883,WHITEY,Order! Order! The only poor people I want to hear about are the people who tend to my pores at the spa. Just send them both to the robot loony bin and let's go.
8884,FRY,(from box) Ow! My head! Ow! My feet! Ow! My head! Ow! My feet!

8889,FRY,"Oh, good, a physical! Once they examine my fragile, naked, pink body, they'll see I'm not a--"
8890,FRY,What the--?
8891,BENDER,(shouting) I find that offensive!
8892,DR. PERCEPTRON,Greetings. I am Dr. Perceptron. Let me give you something to help you relax.
8893,FRY,"Look! There's been a terrible mistake. I'm a human being. See?  I'm all squishy and flabby. Also, I complain a lot."
8894,DR. PERCEPTRON,"Yes, you do. You need to relax more. Terrific. Now, consider the following: You were admitted to this robot asylum. Therefore, you must be a robot. Diagnosis complete."
8895,FRY,I do other human stuff! I age! See?
8896,NURSE RATCHET,"I'm Nurse Ratchet. Please come with me, won't you?"
8897,NURSE RATCHET,"We'll meet your roommate next, shall we? His name is Malfunctioning Eddie."
8898,FRY,The car dealer? Wow! I guess his prices really were insane.
8899,NURSE RATCHET,He's very excitable.  So don't say anything to excite him.
8900,MALFUNCTIONING EDDIE,Pleased to meet you.
8901,FRY,"Actually, we've met once before."
8902,MALFUNCTIONING EDDIE,What?
8903,HAIRBOT,I'm a pretty girl. I'm a pretty girl. I'm a pretty girl.
8904,BENDER,Whoa! Someone had a busy day.
8905,FRY,"My roommate exploded. Oh, you gotta help me, Bender. How can I prove I'm human?"
8906,BENDER,You could drop dead. That'd show 'em.
8907,FRY,I don't wanna!
8908,UNIT 2013,"Hey, man. I believe you're a human."
8909,FRY,You do?
8910,UNIT 2013,"Sure. They don't believe I'm a human either. Name's Unit 2013. C'mon. Lemme introduce you around.  Fry, meet Norm. How's it going, pal? Still picking up transmissions from the CIA on your teeth?"
8911,NORM,They just won't stop!
8912,WOMAN,"The CIA cafeteria menu for the week of May 15th is as follows: Monday, shepherd's pie. Tu--"
8913,UNIT 2013,Cuckoo!
8914,FRY,Let me guess: He thinks he's Lincoln?
8915,UNIT 2013,"Well, he's supposed to. Problem is he's got multiple personalities; all of them Lincoln."
8916,LINCOLNBOT,I was born in 200 log cabins.
8917,UNIT 2013,"And this here is Frankie. He's convinced he's a lunchroom worker, so they put him to work in the lunchroom. (patronising) How is work in the lunchroom, Frankie?"
8918,FRANKIE,It's alright.
8919,UNIT 2013,Poor Frankie!
8920,MAD HATTERBOT,Change places!
8921,FRY,"Bender, I can't take much more of this! I want outta here!"
8922,BENDER,"Are you crazy? This place is great! Electroshock whenever you want it, two Lincolns for every Napoleon.  Ah! Sweet light crude!"
8923,FRY,But I'm not a robot like you. I don't like having discs crammed into me. Unless they're Oreos - and then only in the mouth! Don't you understand? I'm gonna die here!
8924,BENDER,"Ah, quit your bellyaching and take it like a robot."
8925,MAD HATTERBOT,Change places!
8926,VICTOR,The doctor says you are making great strides with your exploding problem.
8927,MALFUNCTIONING EDDIE,Well the way I see it=--
8928,FRY,You gotta get me out of here. I would have starved to death if not for that sick vending machine robot.  Gimmie! Gimmie!
8929,HERMES,Poor Fry! He's got the munchies for freedom!
8930,LEELA,We're all trying to help you. We've petitioned the governor but he doesn't want to appear soft on people who've been falsely imprisoned.
8931,FRY,At least I have friends on the outside. Bender's been no help at all.
8932,BENDER,"Je suis Napoleon!  No, seriously, I'm not."
8933,AMY,Bender! You should be more ashamed of yourself than usual.
8934,BENDER,"Ah, lighten up, honey. I'm just trying to get through a difficult time using humour."
8935,NURSE RATCHET,Visiting hours are over. Time for our medication disks.
8936,FRY,"(shouting) Help me! For God's sake, help me!"
8937,FARNSWORTH,"Oh, don't worry, Fry. I too once spent a nightmare-ish time in a robot asylum. But now it's nearly over. So long."
8938,FRY,"(sleep-talking) Thirty days hath September, April, June and ... wonder ... is that peanut butter ... what am I gonna do? (talking) Oh, God! What? What? What is it now?"
8939,DR. PERCEPTRON,You are being released.
8940,FRY,"Finally! Sweet justice! Sweet, juicy justice!"
8941,DR. PERCEPTRON,Not you. Him.
8942,MALFUNCTIONING EDDIE,Me? What a surprise.  Look!
8943,MALFUNCTIONING EDDIE,I barely exploded at all.
8944,DR. PERCEPTRON,We can control that with medication.
8945,NURSE RATCHET,Fry? Are we ready to meet our new roommate?
8946,ROBERTO,"Hi, Red!"
8947,FRY,Roberto! W-W-W-What are you doing here?
8948,ROBERTO,I got busted robbing that bank again.
8949,FRY,Why would you hold up the same bank twice?
8950,ROBERTO,"Ah, that first time was just to case the joint and rob it a little.  What's the matter? You scared?"
8951,FRY,"N--, n--, n--"
8952,ROBERTO,"Noticeably? I'll say! Now stand back, I gotta practice my stabbing."
8953,FRY,No! Please! Help! Stop it! Please!
8954,BENDER,(shouting; from cell) Hey! Keep it down in there! I'm tuning my banjo!
8955,ROBERTO,"Jeez, Red. Quit cowering. You call yourself a robot?"
8956,FRY,I'm not a robot! (shouting) I'm not a robot!
8957,DR. PERCEPTRON,"In answer to your question, Hermes, yes, your friend is cured."
8958,HERMES,Oh!
8959,FARNSWORTH,What a relief!
8960,LEELA,Thank God!
8961,DR. PERCEPTRON,You'll notice he no longer suffers delusions of humanity.
8962,FRY,"(mechanical voice) Affirmative. I feel nothing. I am a robot. Beep, beep, beep ..."
8963,LEELA,"You've made a terrible mistake. He's a human being, not a machine. Oh, Fry!"
8964,BENDER,"(singing) Gonna sing a little tale about a battle called Waterloo. (talking) Bonjour, y'all!"
8965,ZOIDBERG,"Listen to me, Fry. Just because you think you're a robot, doesn't make you a robot. After all, I think I'm a doctor but that doesn't make me a doctor. These fancy clothes do!"
8966,FRY,(mechanical voice) Negative. I must be a robot. Why else would human women refuse to date me?
8967,LEELA,"Oh, lots of reasons."
8968,FRY,"(mechanical voice) Bio-units, terminate noise exchange. It is time for you to ingest sandwiches from my compartment."
8969,BENDER,Here we go. Just a minute. Aha!
8970,COMMENTATOR,"And down the stretch, it's Daddy's Little Grandpa, followed by Perennial Loser, and bringing up the rear, it's Lasty!"
8971,BENDER,"Come on, Lasty!"
8972,ROBERTO,"Hey, Bender."
8973,BENDER,"Roberto! Ooh, what a surprise to see you in here! Especially 'cause I didn't squeal on you, remember? Remember all that squealing I didn't do? Remember? Do ya?"
8974,ROBERTO,"Yeah, yeah. Now lie down and play dead. And don't ham it up!"
8975,BENDER,"Uh, sure.  Anything for you, buddy."
8976,ROBERTO,"Wait here, Bender. I need to get a disguise."
8977,BENDER,"Uh, what's with the get-up?"
8978,ROBERTO,I'm in disguise 'cause I'm thinking of escaping. You in? Or do I gotta kill ya so you don't squeal?
8979,BENDER,I'm in! I'm in!  So when were you planning the breakout?
8980,ROBERTO,I'm thinking maybe a few seconds ago.
8981,BENDER,Quick! Let's keep escaping!
8982,HERMES,"Times two, carry the one ..."
8983,FRY,"Oh, you sad, worthless human."
8984,HERMES,What are ya--? Sacred hog of Prague! That was my anniversary gift to LaBarbara!
8985,FRY,Fear not! For I shall assist ye!
8986,HERMES,"Robots don't say ""ye""!"
8987,FRY,"Relax, mammal. My robotic software shall meet your calculatory needs.  What is the meaning of this symbol?"
8988,HERMES,"That's a plus sign, you pointy-haired loony! Quit thinking you're a robot!"
8989,FRY,I'll show ye!
8990,FRY,Stand back. I'm a tool-bot.
8991,LEELA,You're not a tool-bot. You're not a food-motron. You're not a robot of any kind.
8992,FRY,"Yes, I am. I simply haven't discovered my primary function yet."
8993,LEELA,"OK, this has gotta stop. I'm going to remind Fry of his humanity the way only a woman can."
8994,FARNSWORTH,You're going to do his laundry?
8995,LEELA,"(sexfully) Fry, this is for you."
8996,FRY,Beep.
8997,LEELA,"Oh, for God's sake!"
8998,ZOIDBERG,"By a scallop's forelocks! What's with all the beer, Fry?"
8999,FRY,"(drunk) Alcohol fuels my power cells. And as a mighty robot, I--  Beep."
9000,ROBERTO,"Thanks for helping me escape, Bender."
9001,BENDER,"Oh, it was nothing."
9002,ROBERTO,(shouting) It was not nothing! (talking) I wanna repay you. Let me get you something in here.
9003,ROBERTO,(shouting) Hands up! This is a stick-up again!
9004,BENDER,"Wow! Hitting the same place three times? I admire your style, Roberto."
9005,ROBERTO,Gimmie the remaining dough. And the calendars ... and that pen. Try to tear it so most of the beads are on my end!
9006,URL,Police! You're busted!
9007,SMITTY,And don't try anything. This glass here is laser-proof.  Fire lasers!  Duck! Lasers!
9008,BENDER,Come on! I got a place where I like to hide after crimes.
9009,AMY,Aw! He looks like a little insane drunken angel.
9010,BENDER,"(panting) Hey, everybody. Meet my good pal, Roberto."
9011,HERMES,"Hey, mon."
9012,ROBERTO,Nice to meet you.
9013,SMITTY,(on megaphone; from outside) Come out with your hands up.
9014,ROBERTO,(shouting) Hostages!
9015,ROBERTO,Back off! I got hostages!
9016,ZOIDBERG,Hooray! I'm helping!
9017,SMITTY,(on megaphone) Do you have any better hostages?
9018,ROBERTO,"To show them who's crazy, I'm gonna execute some of you. How 'bout you?"
9019,FARNSWORTH,Ouch! That's going to bleed when my heart beats.
9020,LEELA,Wait! Take me first!
9021,BENDER,Yes! Take her first.
9022,ROBERTO,Shut up! Stop telling me how to do this!
9023,ZOIDBERG,"Oh, the fear!"
9024,ROBERTO,I'm thinking of a number between one and ten. Guess it and you die first. Go!
9025,BENDER,Um ... OK. Fixty ... six ... ish?
9026,ROBERTO,"56? 56? Oh, man! Now that's all I can think about! I'm gonna kill you, you ... no good ... 56-ing--"
9027,BENDER,Don't kill me yet! I'm starting to come down with Stockholm syndrome ... handsome!
9028,FRY,"Halt, fellow robot!"
9029,ROBERTO,"Hey, Red. You're just in time to join the hostage situation. Which side you wanna be on?"
9030,FRY,"The side that kicks your twisted, metal ass!"
9031,LEELA,Fry! Stay back. He's too powerful.
9032,FRY,"Negative, bossy meat creature. I know now what my primary function is: I am a battle-droid. Sworn to protect the weak from crazy robots."
9033,ROBERTO,I'm not crazy! Don't call me crazy! I'm just not user-friendly!
9034,HERMES,Fry! Don't be a hero! It's not covered by the health plan!
9035,ROBERTO,Let's see how much of a robot you really are!
9036,FRY,No knife can penetrate my skin-tanium armour.
9037,ROBERTO,"Help! Help! He is a battle-droid! Somebody help me! Mommy! I'm sorry I spilled the transmission fluid, Mommy! No! No! Don't weld me to the wall, Mommy!"
9038,SMITTY,(on megaphone) We're willing to listen to your demands.
9039,URL,"Hey, baby. Wash that off before you put it back."
9040,HERMES,Who's brave now?
9041,AMY,Hooray!
9042,ZOIDBERG,Bravo!
9043,LEELA,"You did it, Fry."
9044,BENDER,"Congratulations, buddy. You're a credit to my race."
9045,FRY,"(mechanical voice) It was nothing. I-- (normal) Blood? Robots don't have blood. I must be a, a--"
9046,ZOIDBERG,A squid?
9047,FRY,"A human! Oh, my God! I'm a human!"
9048,ZOIDBERG,Also good.
9049,LEELA,"Thanks for saving us, Fry."
9050,FRY,I'm gonna continue never washing this cheek again.
9051,BENDER,"Buddy, you may be wrapped in greasy skin, but inside, you've got the heart of a robot."
9052,FRY,"Aw. Thanks, Bender."
9053,BENDER,"Just like inside me, I've got the heart of a human.  What?"
9054,THE END,
9055,BENDER,(over credits) What?
9056,"""BENDIN' IN THE WIND""",
9057,BENDER,"(singing) Froggy went a-courtin' and he did ride, uh-huh, uh-huh"
9058,FRY,Oh my God! They dug up a bag of olestra chips from my time!  There must be layers and layers of old stuff down there.
9059,BENDER,What's that? One of those Led Zeppelins I've heard so much about?
9060,FRY,"No, it's an old Volkswagen van.  (shouting) Hey, Mister? Mind if I take this old van?"
9061,SAL,"(shouting) Sure. You wanna dump the corpses out of theres, it's yourses."
9062,FRY,"Yeah yeah, I've gotten used cars before."
9063,LEELA,What's that? One of those Jefferson Starships I've heard so much about?
9064,FRY,"It's called a van, and in light of the fact that it's not a-rockin', I invite you to come a-knockin'!"
9065,AMY,"Wow, neat."
9066,HERMES,It's a triumph of free-spirited German engineering.
9067,AMY,"Hey, the speedometer only goes up to 80. This thing can't go faster than 80,000 miles an hour?"
9068,FRY,"No, it can't, but it's got a driver's-side floor and an 8-track player with genuine mono sound."
9069,FARNSWORTH,Where's the device that lets you speed or slow the passage of time?
9070,FRY,Under the seat.
9071,LEELA,Why won't it start?
9072,FRY,It just needs some gas.
9073,FARNSWORTH,"Wrong again, idiot. There is no gas. Petroleum reserves ran dry in 2038."
9074,LEELA,"Gas was an environmental disaster, anyway. Now we use alternative fuels."
9075,FRY,Like what?
9076,LEELA,"Whale oil.  Bender, lift it up to the can opener."
9077,BENDER,"Oh, no, I'm not going near it. Last time, that magnetic psycho nearly cut my head off."
9078,FRY,"Oh, right. Plus, the magnet screws up your inhibition unit and makes you sing folk songs."
9079,BENDER,What? Who said anything about me secretly wanting to be a folk singer? How ridiculous.
9080,FRY,"Bender, if you don't open that can right now, your fear will own you, and nothing that can opener could ever do could be worse than that."
9081,BENDER,"OK, OK, I can do this. It's time to take life by the cans."
9082,LEELA,Come on.
9083,HERMES,You can do it.
9084,AMY,Bender!
9085,FARNSWORTH,"Go on, you dummy."
9086,BENDER,(singing) Jimmy cracked corn and I don't care
9087,FRY,"Oh, no!"
9088,BENDER,(singing) 'Cause the master's gone away.
9089,ZOIDBERG,It's toe-tapping-ly tragic.
9090,BENDER,"Doc, I can't move my arms and legs. What's wrong with me?"
9091,DOCTOR,This is the worst part of the job.
9092,BENDER,"What is it, good news?"
9093,DOCTOR,"Bender, your hydraulics are shot. You'll never move again."
9094,BENDER,You mean -?
9095,DOCTOR,"I'm sorry, you'll have to get a new one."
9096,FRY,"Oh, no, this is terrible."
9097,ZOIDBERG,Poor Bender.
9098,FARNSWORTH,"Well, let's drag him to the kerb."
9099,FRY,"Wait a minute, Bender is my best friend. We can't just dump him in the gutter like Grandma's ashes."
9100,BENDER,"(crying) Oh, my life is over. I'll never know happiness again."
9101,ROBOT,"Ho ho, hello there!"
9102,LEELA,"Look, Bender. It's Patch Cord Adams. He heals with the power of laughter."
9103,PATCH CORD ADAMS,"C'mon, take it. What's the matter, can't move your arms?"
9104,BENDER,"Obviously not, or I'd be strangling you right now."
9105,PATCH CORD ADAMS,"Hey, here's a giggle!  Did you hear why they're using Windows 3000 as a prison guard?"
9106,FRY,"No, why?"
9107,PATCH CORD ADAMS,'Cause it always locks up.
9108,BENDER,"For the love of God, somebody kick his ass!"
9109,PATCH CORD ADAMS,"Well, so long. Get well soon.  Oh, well, so long anyway."
9110,BENDER,"Oh, I'm doomed. Everybody leave me alone. I don't wanna be seen this way."
9111,FRY,"Aw, you look so sad. You want me to send Patch Cord Adams back in?"
9112,BENDER,"Hey, the blues. The tragic sound of other people suffering. That's kind of a pick-me-up.  Wow, that was great."
9113,BECK,"Hey, thanks. You a fan?"
9114,BENDER,"I dunno. Let me see.  Oh my God, you're Beck! I'd get up to shake your hand and steal your wallet but my crappy body crapped out on me."
9115,BECK,Don't take it so hard. I used to miss my body too but then I fished this manequin out of the 92c Store dumpster.
9116,BENDER,"Wow. We've sure got a lot in common, Beck. I always dreamed of being a musician-poet who transcends genres even as he re-invents them, just like you."
9117,BECK,"So do it, robot. It's easier than it looks."
9118,BENDER,"Eh, thanks, but it's hopeless. I'll never be a musician now."
9119,BECK,Or maybe you'll be the best musician ever.
9120,BENDER,What's this for?
9121,BECK,"Try and scrape it across your chest like a knife on burnt toast.  Come on, move those arms. Use the power of mental thinking. Make it dynamic.  Yeah-ee! Alright, congratulations my friend."
9122,BENDER,Why? 'Cause I can make annoying noises?
9123,BECK,"Exactly. I use those all the time in my music. Bender, I want you to become my new washboard player."
9124,BENDER,Alright!  Go Bender! Go Bender! Go Bender!
9125,BENDER,"Well, that's my good friend, Beck. I'm of to rock a series of mid-level venues."
9126,HERMES,"Kudos, Bender. You got mangled and now you're a singer. Both our dreams came true."
9127,FRY,"Hey, I have an idea. Who wants to cram in my van and follow Bender on tour and live there, in the van?"
9128,ZOIDBERG,"Oh, I don't know, Fry. I think I'm too poor to follow a band around in a van."
9129,BECK,"(shouting) Come on, move it! We gotta get to the concert and make the audience wait for it at the start."
9130,ZOIDBERG,"Bad news, friends. My shell ran."
9131,AMY,"Zoidberg, you idiot, my outfit. It's, it's -"
9132,LEELA,Kinda cool.
9133,FRY,"Yeah, I like it."
9134,AMY,"Me too, now that I'm used to it."
9135,ZOIDBERG,"Then it was all on purpose. You're lucky to have Zoidberg as a friend. But cross me, and I'll turn on you like that."
9136,BECK,(singing) There's a destination a little up the road
9137,ALL,(singing) Where it's at!
9138,BENDER,(electric voice) Got a washboard stomach and a microphone.
9139,BECK,That was a washboard break.
9140,FRY,Oh yeah!
9141,AMY,"Yeah!  One bowl of Jell-O knuckles, please."
9142,BARMAN,That'll be three pick-e-tures of George Washington.
9143,AMY,"Oh no, my beautiful money."
9144,LEELA,It got ruined in the wash.
9145,FRY,"Mine too, even my change."
9146,BARMAN,Get lost you money-less hippies!
9147,BECK,"Bender, that was the best 40-minute washboard solo I've ever heard. And the parts when I was awake blew my mind."
9148,BENDER,"Whoa, check out all those broken robots. Howdy, fellas!"
9149,ROBOT #1,"I don't believe my broken eyes, it's Bender, the washboard player! Hey man, we caught your concert from here."
9150,ROBOT #2,You rock!
9151,FEMBOT,"Oh, oh, Bender! Sign my chest!"
9152,ROBOT #3,"Yo, brother, thanks for showing us broken robots are still useful."
9153,BENDER,"Aw, hang in there, folks. I'll bet before you know it, you guys'll be -  That is so wrong. They can't just melt down broken robots. Not right when they're kissing my ass."
9154,BECK,"Whoa, dog. Just cold chill.  You know, when I'm upset, I write a song about it. Like when I wrote Devil's Haircut, I was feeling really...what's that song about?"
9155,BENDER,"Hey, yeah, I could write a song! With real words, not phony ones like ""odelay""."
9156,BECK,"""Odelay"" is a word. Just look it up in the Becktionary."
9157,BENDER,Ooh!
9158,BENDER,"I'm working on my song. Hand me the Becktionary.  No, no, the rhyming Becktionary."
9159,BECK,I wish I could help raise awareness about broken robots. But what can I do? I only weigh eight pounds.
9160,BENDER,"Wait a minute, you know lots of rock stars, and most of them like to look as though they care about things!"
9161,BECK,We can all get together for a big benefit concert in San Francisco!
9162,BENDER,"And we could call it ""Bend-Aid"", after me, Bender!"
9163,BECK,And you can sing that song you're writing!
9164,BENDER,And I'll let you sing backup! But remember who the star is. Me: Bender.
9165,BENDER,"Alright. ""Hands in the air"" rhymes with ""Just don't care"" and...finished!  Eck! Smells like something died in the wall!"
9166,FRY,Surprise!
9167,LEELA,Mind if we crash here tonight? The colours in the van are keeping us awake.
9168,BENDER,"Alright, but hands off the minibar."
9169,FRY,"Wow, I forgot about TV. Living free on the road, you realise how much better life is without it. Well, let's see what's on."
9170,ANNOUNCER #1,"(voice-over; on TV) Tuesday, Golden Gate Park, the monsters of vaguely folkish alterna-rock will strum your brains out at Bend-Aid! Featuring Beck, Wailing Fungus and special guest, Bender!"
9171,ANNOUNCER #2,(voice-over; on TV) A portion of the proceeds might go to help broken robots.
9172,FRY,Yeah!
9173,ZOIDBERG,"Hooray, robot!"
9174,AMY,"Bender, you're famous!"
9175,BENDER,Yeah.
9176,LEELA,"This coming together of superstars really means a lot to you, doesn't it, Bender?"
9177,BENDER,"(crying) Uh-huh. Helping my defective brothers is the first thing I've ever cared about, even the slightest bit. You know, when I first got broken, I thought my life was over. But look at me now. I've got fame, money, groupies, and it's all thanks to being completely immobolised.  That's why I'll be proud to go up on stage, tomorrow, and say, ""Look at me, world, I am a broken robot!""."
9178,FRY,"Bender, you can move! You're cured!"
9179,BENDER,"Oh crap, it's a miracle."
9180,BENDER,I can move again. (crying) My music career is over.
9181,FRY,"Bender, I don't claim to understand ""the biz"" but wouldn't being able to move help your music career?"
9182,BENDER,"(crying) No, don't you see? I was a hero to broken robots 'cause I was one of them. But how can I sing about being damaged if I'm not? That's like Christina Aguilera singing in Spanish.  Wait, that's it. I'll fake it!"
9183,AMY,You'd better not do that at the concert.
9184,ZOIDBERG,"I can't stop. When I eat too much dirt, I get stuff in my throat."
9185,AMY,"You are so disgusting, I -"
9186,LEELA,They're beautiful.
9187,ZOIDBERG,"Eww, you're touching them."
9188,AMY,"I've never seen pearls like this. Dr. Zoidberg, you're amazing."
9189,ZOIDBERG,I am? At last! Recognition!
9190,EMCEE,"Gentle-hippies, put your filthy hands together for the folk stylings of Cylon and Garfunkel!"
9191,GARFUNKEL,"Here's a song that was beautiful when it was performed by my ancestor, Art."
9192,CYLON AND GARFUNKEL,"(singing) Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme."
9193,GARFUNKEL,"(singing) Remember me to one who loves there,"
9194,CYLON AND GARFUNKEL,(singing) She once was a true love of mine.
9195,LEELA,We're home.
9196,AMY,"Well, let's earn some bread."
9197,FRY,"Brothers and sisters, get your love beads. Can't journey to the centre of your mind without love beads!"
9198,HIPPIE #1,"Wow, look at these colours. These'll go great with my soul."
9199,ZOIDBERG,"Glad you like them. I've been making fine jewellery for years, apparently."
9200,HIPPIE #2,I'll take three.
9201,HIPPIE #3,"Give me one, man!"
9202,HIPPIE #4,I'll trade you a bad poem!
9203,EMCEE,"And now, stand up and turn on your hidden tape recorders for...Beck! With special guest, Bender the broken robot."
9204,FRY,(shouting) Bender rules!
9205,HIPPIE #5,"Groove on, man!"
9206,LEELA,"Rock it, Bender!"
9207,ZOIDBERG,Play that thing!
9208,BECK,(shouting) Can't you hear those cavalry drums
9209,BENDER,"Whoa-oh, yeah!"
9210,BECK,(shouting) ...Midnight hags in the mausoleum...
9211,BECK,"Thank you. That song doesn't usually last three hours, but we got into a serious thing...and then I forgot how it ended. Anyway, one last item of business before we go."
9212,GARFUNKEL,"Bender, to start your foundation for broken robots, here's a big cardboard cheque for $14,000."
9213,CYLON,It's been an emotional day for me.
9214,BENDER,(crying) I don't know what to say.
9215,BECK,Then maybe you should sing it. Lay it down boys.
9216,BENDER,"Ladies, gentlemen, smoking heaps of machinery......this is a song called My Broken Friend."
9217,BECK,Kick it!
9218,BENDER,(singing) He could make a good...
9219,BENDER AND BECK,(singing) ...hatrack
9220,BECK,(singing) He only has to stand there
9221,BENDER,(singing) Or a cheap...
9222,BENDER AND BECK,(singing) ...doorstop
9223,BECK,(singing) He doesn't need to move
9224,BENDER,(singing) Or a great big...
9225,BENDER AND BECK,(singing) ...giant Thermos
9226,BENDER,(singing) With a twist-off top
9227,BECK,(singing) That would be good for soup
9228,BENDER,(singing) He could be a storage closet...
9229,BENDER AND BECK,(singing) ...For outdated pants
9230,BECK,I like 'em tight!
9231,BENDER,(singing) My broken friend could do it all...
9232,BENDER AND BECK,(singing) ...Just give him a chance!
9233,BENDER,(singing) That robot has a tragic secret
9234,BECK,For real?
9235,BENDER,(singing) ...My broken friend is closer to me
9236,BECK,Hm.
9237,BENDER,(singing) ...That robot's name I never told you...
9238,BECK,Who's that?
9239,BENDER,(singing) ...You could not foresee...
9240,BECK,"C'mon, give it up."
9241,BENDER,(singing) ...I'll say it loud and sing it proud...
9242,BENDER AND BECK,(singing) His name is you and me.
9243,BENDER,(singing) Don't melt me down into a crowbar
9244,BECK,(singing) It suffers alone
9245,BENDER,(singing) Just 'cause I can't move my arms and legs
9246,BECK,Hey.
9247,BENDER,(singing) Or toss me into a trash can...
9248,BECK,"Bender, what are you doing?"
9249,BENDER,(singing) ...Just 'cause I can't cook you ham and eggs...
9250,BECK,What are you doing?
9251,BENDER,(singing) ...Don't crush me into an anchor...
9252,BECK,What's the dealy-o?
9253,BENDER,(singing) ...Just 'cause I can't jump and dance and sing...
9254,BECK,Hold it! What? No!
9255,BENDER,"(singing) ...I'm telling you, my broken friend..."
9256,BECK,B-Bender.
9257,BENDER,(singing) ...Put your hands in the air like you just don't care!
9258,BECK,No!
9259,BENDER,"(singing) I'm telling you, my broken friend..."
9260,BECK,Cut it!
9261,BENDER,(singing) ...Can do 'most anything!
9262,BECK,Cut it!
9263,BENDER,Yeah!
9264,BECK,Cut it!
9265,BENDER,Curse my natural showmanship!
9266,ROBOT #1,(shouting) You big fat fraud! You're not really broken!
9267,ROBOT #2,(shouting) But you will be in a minute! Bum-rush the stage!
9268,ROBOT #3,Get him!
9269,HIPPIE #6,"Oh harsh, I didn't get my beads."
9270,BECK,"You, minion, lift up my arm.  After him!"
9271,BENDER,"Well everyone, prepare to get your guts kicked out by folk singers."
9272,CATERPILLAR ALIEN,What is this? The Year of the Jerk?
9273,FRY,"Hurry, the Golden Gate Bridge. Put the metal to the pedal to the other metal."
9274,BENDER,"Oh no, I forgot this is a hoverbridge."
9275,LEELA,And I forgot this isn't a hovercar.
9276,FRY,Is any of that a problem?
9277,ZOIDBERG,Not if you've lived a life without regret.
9278,BENDER,I'll save me!
9279,LEELA,"Quick, grab his footcups."
9280,BENDER,Hey? What? No.
9281,FRY,Phew!
9282,LEELA,Bummer.
9283,BENDER,"(shouting) Someone fat get in my way! (talking) Ah, I'm broken again. I can't move any part of me."
9284,BECK,Good.
9285,BENDER,"I'm really sorry I lied, Beck. All I ever wanted was to make music with you. I never meant to hurt anyone, or help anyone."
9286,BECK,"Bender, that's some played-out, new-jack, horsecrap. But I know you don't mean it so, apology accepted."
9287,BENDER,"So, I can, uh, keep the cheque?"
9288,GARFUNKEL,Over my dead career!
9289,BENDER,"Well, it was worth a shot."
9290,FRY,"(shouting) C'mon, Bender. If you're done scamming Beck, we're heading home."
9291,BENDER,"Alright, alright. Let me just do one thing to cheer myself up."
9292,THE END,
9293,"""TIME KEEPS ON SLIPPING""",
9294,HERMES,"Go get it, boy!"
9295,FRY,"So, Leela, how about a romantic ride in one of those swan boats? They're kinda dangerous but I finally mastered them."
9296,LEELA,"Those aren't swan boats, they're swans."
9297,FRY,Oh. That explains these boat eggs.
9298,FARNSWORTH,Wha?
9299,TATE,"Pitiful ballplayers of Earth, I am Ethan ""Bubblegum"" Tate, commander of the Harlem Globetrotters.  For generations, your puny planet has lived in peace with the Globetrotter Homeworld. But now, for no reason, we challenge you to defend your honour on the basketball court. Will no one meet our challenge? Have none of you pathetic Earthlings game?"
9300,FRY,(shouting) What happens if we lose?
9301,TATE,Nothing. There's nothing at stake and no threat - beyond the shame of defeat!
9302,FARNSWORTH,"This will not stand!  I'll take you on, you air-balling bozos."
9303,TATE,"You, old man? Sweet Clyde, laugh derisively at him."
9304,FARNSWORTH,"I may be an old man - in fact, I'm fairly sure I am - but I'll put you Globetrotters in your place with my team of mutant atomic supermen!"
9305,HERMES,"Hooray, professor!"
9306,FARNSWORTH,Behold: My mutant atomic supermen.
9307,LEELA,"They're only a foot high, professor."
9308,FARNSWORTH,"Well, they're still young. Mere atomic super boys, really. We'll need to speed up their growth with time particles called Chronitons."
9309,BENDER,Aren't those the particles that destroyed an entire civilisation -
9310,FARNSWORTH,"Good news, everyone. You're off to the Tempest Nebula to gather Chronitons."
9311,FRY,"Hey, Leela. Look at me!"
9312,LEELA,Your face can take a lot of punishment. That's good to know.
9313,FRY,There's a lot about my face you don't know. Perhaps you and it could get better acquainted over dinner.
9314,LEELA,"Alright, cool your jets, hotshot."
9315,FRY,"C'mon, Leela, why won't you go out with me? We both know there's something there."
9316,LEELA,"No, I mean cool your jets. They're melting Bender's face."
9317,BENDER,(shouting) Ow! Oh my God! Ow!
9318,LEELA,Here you go. Hot off the nebula.
9319,FARNSWORTH,None too soon. While you were gone the Trotters held a news conference to announce that I was a jive sucker.  Behold! My invincible nuclear mutants.
9320,AMY,Hi!
9321,ARACHNEON,Hello!
9322,ALBERT,Marv Albert here at Madison Cube Garden where the Harlem Globerotters take on a squad of atomic supermen in what promises to be a by-the-numbers athletic contest with no surprises whatsoever.  Here's the tip-off. Globetrotter ball. Sweet Clyde Dixon to Bubblegum Tate. Drives down-court - and Curly Joe from the rear.
9323,ZOIDBERG,That one grabbed his behindus!
9324,LEELA,Shh!
9325,HERMES,Quiet!
9326,TATE,Who dares laugh at the Jesters of Dunk? We came to terrify and humiliate you - not tickle your funnybones. Watch as I embarrass your civilisation by passing the ball to Curly Joe.  Only to have it remain in my hands with elastic. And perhaps this will wipe the smiles from your faces.
9327,ALBERT,Goose goes up... Rejected! Growtrium from half-court.  Yes!
9328,ALBERT,"Supermen lead 45-42. Arachneon with the steal, to Thorias. Thorias from downtown!  Yes! He's really showing us what a man with a cannon in his chest can do!"
9329,FARNSWORTH,"No showboarding, you atomic hotdog!"
9330,ALBERT,"And that's the half, with the Supermen up 48-42. Surprisingly dull, so far. Bubblegum, the Trotters are down by six. Reactions?"
9331,TATE,It was always our plan to trail at the half. Thus deepening Earth's eventual humiliation. Also: What game were the refs watching?
9332,ALBERT,"Curly Joe, easily amused by his own antics......continues to wreak havoc on -"
9333,FARNSWORTH,What the?  Did everything just jump around? Or did my brain just stroke off there for a second?
9334,ALBERT,"Ladies and gentlemen, something very strange has just happened in this basketball game between space clowns and atomic monsters."
9335,FARNSWORTH,Time-out! Time-out!
9336,FRY,What's happening?
9337,FARNSWORTH,"We seem to be lurching forward randomly in time, like a needle skipping on a record player."
9338,AMY,What's causing it? Is it my outfit?
9339,FARNSWORTH,No. It must have something to do with those time particles I used to grow the Supermen. Time and space are ripping apart at the seams.
9340,THORIAS,Oops.
9341,FARNSWORTH,"Oh, great. Now, on top of everything, we need a new fifth man."
9342,FRY,"Ooh, ooh, ooh, put me in, professor. I wanna show Leela my skills."
9343,FARNSWORTH,Hmm. Will said skills pay the bills?
9344,FRY,Who cares? We're 35 points ahead with two minutes left. What could possibly -
9345,ALBERT,"Globetrotters win, 244-86. A dark day for humanity, folks. We have been beaten...in basketball."
9346,CURLY JOE,"Yeah, that's ow we do it!"
9347,SWEET CLYDE,How's that?
9348,TATE,You are all fools of the highest calibre.
9349,LEELA,"I don't know what you did, Fry, but once again you screwed up. Now all the planets are gonna start cracking wise about our mamas."
9350,HERMES,"I'm just glad my fat, ugly mama isn't alive to see this day."
9351,FARNSWORTH,"Enough about your promiscuous mother, Hermes. We have bigger problems. This time disruption is extremely serious."
9352,TATE,"Damn right, brother man. This chronological wang-dang-doodle could destroy the very matrix of reality."
9353,FARNSWORTH,Tate? What do you know about this?
9354,TATE,"Not much, yet. But I am senior lecturer of physics at Globetrotter U. And I like to help you investigate."
9355,FARNSWORTH,You're that Bubblegum Tate?
9356,TATE,"Well I sure ain't his grandma. Now look here, prof......I think we got ourselves an excess of Chronitons in the subatomic interstices."
9357,FARNSWORTH,"Yes, I see. Something involving that many big words could easily destabilise time itself."
9358,FRY,Is that a problem?
9359,FARNSWORTH,"Indeed so. At this rate, by Tuesday it will be Thursday; By Wednesday, it will be August and by Thursday, it will be the end of existence as we know it."
9360,MAN,I'll have to ask you to clear out now. The circus need to set up for tomorrow's big -
9361,LINDA,Time continues to skip forward randomly. Details at 11.
9362,LINDA,This is the news at 11. The mysterious an unexplained -
9363,LINDA,"Turning to entertainment news, teen singer Wendy might just be the latest -"
9364,LINDA,...won three Grammys last night -
9365,LINDA,...found dead in her bathtub.
9366,FARNSWORTH,"Interesting. It's as if we behave normally during the time skips, but then we have no memory of it."
9367,FRY,You mean we just -
9368,FARNSWORTH,"...my, yes. Ooh, just like that. Any luck Bubblegum?"
9369,TATE,"Not yet. Listen, I hope you don't mind if I dribble a little while I work."
9370,FARNSWORTH,Not if you'll grant me the same liberty.
9371,BENDER,"Ooh, ohh, Bubblegum? My name's Bender and I'm a huge fan of your work, both on and off the court. Can I be a Globetrotter?"
9372,TATE,"Shut up, turkey."
9373,FARNSWORTH,"Bubblegum, look at this. The background time radiation is fluctuating wildly."
9374,TATE,"Good Lord. That sucker's shaking around like some fine, imported booty."
9375,HERMES,"Say, I'm no physicist, but I think I know how to stop the skipping. We'll just -"
9376,HERMES,I don't know how this was supposed to work.
9377,AMY,"Professor, I hope you find out what's wrong before we skip right past my birth -"
9378,ALL,"Happy birthday, Amy."
9379,AMY,"Hooray, look at all these presents!"
9380,ZOIDBERG,I hope we all have as much tomorrow at my birth -
9381,ZOIDBERG,What?
9382,FRY,"Psst, Leela. I've set up a time-proof shelter in the closet. There's only room for two, and you're the one I wanna share it with."
9383,LEELA,"Fry, that's so sweet. Let me see."
9384,LEELA,How exactly will this protect us from time jumps?
9385,FRY,"(sexfully) Because when we're together in here, baby, time will stand still."
9386,FRY,Ow.
9387,ZOIDBERG,Hmm.  Hmm.
9388,LEELA,"Dr. Zoidberg, can I talk to you about Fry?"
9389,ZOIDBERG,"Leela, I would be honoured."
9390,LEELA,...Does the worst W.C. Fields imitation I've ever seen. Zoidberg!
9391,ZOIDBERG,"Sorry, you must have been boring me."
9392,LEELA,"The thing is, Fry is very sweet. But he's so immature. I love his boyish charm but I hate his childishness."
9393,ZOIDBERG,So he's not perfect. You don't wanna end up old and lonely like Zoidberg! You were saying?
9394,FARNSWORTH,"Ah, there is it. The Tempest Nebula. Take a whiff through the smellescope."
9395,TATE,What's that funky jazz?
9396,FARNSWORTH,"The odour of pure time leaking. When my crew removed the Chronitons, it destabilised the nebula, causing time skips throughout the universe."
9397,BENDER,"Ooh, let Bubblegum tell it."
9398,TATE,"Pretend these basketballs are time particles, my silver honky. As the nebula bounce-passes them off us......they cause these dents, or ""time skips""."
9399,BENDER,You are so smart!
9400,TATE,Hold up. What if we were to move this cluster of starts to these algebraic co-ordinates?
9401,FARNSWORTH,Their gravity might just divert the Chronitons to the empty side of the universe.
9402,TATE,Yeah. But is it possible? Moving stars would require one bad-ass gravity pump. And we'd need all the money on Earth to -
9403,TATE,What the?
9404,FARNSWORTH,Wha?
9405,NIXON,"Here's the funding for your gravity pump. But it damn well better work! We can't spend all of Earth's money every day. Now, how long will it take to build?"
9406,TATE,"It won't be easy, Nixon. A jim-jam this complex might take months or even -"
9407,FARNSWORTH,"Ah, there we are. One gravity pump. Powerful enough to move the stars themselves. Now to begin the arduous task of attaching it to the ship so th -"
9408,FARNSWORTH,Off you go - apparently.
9409,TATE,"(from ship) Easy, Leela. Just finger-roll that star to the cosmic basket."
9410,LEELA,Just a few...more...hundred...thousand...miles. There!
9411,TATE,(from ship) Nothing but nebula!
9412,LEELA,"We'll have to run some tests back on Earth, but I think we've stopped the time skips."
9413,BENDER,Alright!
9414,TATE,Jamming!
9415,FRY,Hooray for Leela!
9416,BENDER,And what better way to celebrate our success than by me showing Bubblegum the Globetrotter uniform I made myself!
9417,TATE,"Let me see.  Hello, lawsuit!"
9418,FRY,"Leela, I want you to know I think the way you moved those stars around was really wonderful. I got you something."
9419,LEELA,"Moderately-priced, domestic, non-vintage champagne? How did you know?"
9420,FRY,"You deserve it. I mean, nobody ever stops to tell you what a great captain you are."
9421,LEELA,"Aww, that is so true and sweet."
9422,FRY,"You're smart, you're beautiful, and best of all, you'll go out with me-ee?"
9423,LEELA,"Fry, please try to understand. You're a man, I'm a woman. We're just too different."
9424,BENDER,"Hey, Leela. Bubblegum might let me organise a bake sale for the Globetrotter wives. Can you teach me to make cupcakes?"
9425,LEELA,"Alright, but I wanna lick the beaters."
9426,FRY,"I got her champagne, I opened it. What does a guy have to do?"
9427,TATE,"86 the chump stuff, F-man. It's time to win Leela's heart with a big-showy, three-point romantic gesture."
9428,FRY,Hmm. Maybe this is the moment to show her my real surprise.
9429,LEELA,"Fry, what are you doing?"
9430,TATE,Uh-oh. Time to boogie on down to the sauna!
9431,FRY,Look. I've been studying how to pilot the ship. Impressed?
9432,LEELA,"Yeah, actually. You're doing OK. The core reactor temperature's nominal, the blinker's off."
9433,FRY,I learned how to work the gravity pump too. In case we need to move more stars. So are we dating now?
9434,LEELA,"Is that what this is all about? Please, just cut it out now."
9435,FRY,"Look, Leela. I know there's some perfect, amazing thing I can do to make you love me, and when I figure out what it is -"
9436,LEELA,"Fry, stop. I don't wanna hurt you, but there is absolutely, positively no way that you and I will ever, ever -"
9437,PREACHERBOT,...Man and wife. You may kiss the bride.
9438,ALBERT,Yes!
9439,AMY,Woo-hoo!
9440,ZOIDBERG,He looks radiant!
9441,FARNSWORTH,"Ye Gods, Bubblegum, we failed. The time skips haven't stopped at all."
9442,TATE,"Even in these formal shorts, I feel like a failure."
9443,LEELA,"You tricked me into marrying you, didn't you?"
9444,FRY,Of course not.
9445,LEELA,How'd you do it? Drugs in the champagne? Hypnosis?
9446,FRY,"No! Drugs are for losers and hypnosis is for losers with big, weird eyebrows. I don't know what amazing thing I did you make you love me but, whatever it was, we're married now. We've got the rest of our lives to work -"
9447,WHITEY,Divorce is final.
9448,FRY,What?
9449,LEELA,"Well, let's divide up the china. I guess I'll take the NFC helmets and you can have the AFC helmets."
9450,FRY,Fine. Break my heart again.
9451,ZOIDBERG,"Don't be so hard on yourself, Fry. You lost the woman of your dreams, but you still have Zoidberg. You all still have Zoidberg."
9452,FRY,How did I do it? How did I get Leela to love me? I've got to figure it out.
9453,HERMES,"Maybe you're just a fantastic lover, Fry."
9454,AMY,"Um, no."
9455,FRY,I don't know what I'm doing.
9456,BENDER,"Maybe she'd come back to you if your best friend Bender were a Globetrotter. What do you say, Bubblegum?"
9457,TATE,"Hell, no."
9458,FRY,"Oh, it's hopeless. I did something so great that it won Leela's heart and I'll never, ever know what it was. My life is empty."
9459,ZOIDBERG,(sexfully) Zoidberg!
9460,FARNSWORTH,No wonder we failed to stop the time skips. Diverting Chronitons is mathematically impossible. I knew I should have checked your showboating Globetrotter algebra.
9461,TATE,"Man, I thought you knew that algebra was all razzmatazz. A Globetrotter always saves the good algebra for the final minutes."
9462,BENDER,Vintage Bubblegum.
9463,FARNSWORTH,The time skips are worse than ever now. Isolated spots are jumping by years at a time. Look.
9464,KID,Stupid senior citizens. Why should we have to pay for their social security benefits?
9465,OLD MAN,I deserve free money!
9466,FARNSWORTH,"Well, I'm stumped. We'll have to call in the finest scientific minds in the univ -"
9467,FARNSWORTH,"Perhaps we could explode the whole damned nebula. What do you think, Curly Joe?"
9468,CURLY JOE,"No, man. An explosion big enough to destroy that mama would take out half the universe."
9469,SWEET CLYDE,"You gotta Globetrotter that explosion up a little, Farnsy. Make it an implosion."
9470,FARNSWORTH,"By God, Sweet Clyde is right. An implosion might just form a black hole that would stop more Chronitons from escaping."
9471,TATE,"Whoa. Slow that brain train down, prof. We'd need some kind of doomsday device to initiate an implosion like that."
9472,FARNSWORTH,"Doomsday device? Ah, now the ball's in Farnsworth's court.  I suppose I could part with one and still be feared."
9473,TATE,"Give me some skin, prof. I'm making you an honorary Globetrotter. In fact, everybody in this room's an honorary Globetrotter."
9474,AMY,Hooray!
9475,HERMES,Yes!
9476,ZOIDBERG,I'm a Globetrotter!
9477,BENDER,(gasping) Did you just say -
9478,TATE,"Too late, hot plate."
9479,BENDER,"Oh, crap."
9480,TATE,"We must leave now, for we are needed elsewhere. But we wish you Godspeed."
9481,BENDER,"Please, please let me come with you. I can make myself taller."
9482,TATE,"Bender, you can talk trash, you can handle the ball. But look in your heart and ask yourself: Are you funky enough to be a Globetrotter? Are you?"
9483,BENDER,Yes.
9484,TATE,Are you?
9485,BENDER,"I mean, with time, my funk level could -"
9486,TATE,Are you?
9487,BENDER,(sadly) No.
9488,TATE,Deal with it.
9489,BENDER,Oh! No!
9490,LEELA,"Careful with that doomsday device, Bender."
9491,BENDER,"What does it matter? I'll never be a Globetrotter. My life, and, by extension, everyone else's, is meaningless."
9492,LEELA,Roger.
9493,FRY,"Leela, about the wedding. I don't know what I did to make you love me, and I don't think I tricked you into it, but maybe I did. And if I did, I'm sorry."
9494,LEELA,"It's OK, Fry. You know we'll always be friends, right?"
9495,FRY,Yeah. But I don't guess anything I could do will ever make you feel the same way about me that I do about you.
9496,LEELA,I guess not.
9497,BENDER,"Well, the doomsday device is ready. Maybe blasting this quadrant of space into a hell storm of flaming nothingness will cheer me up a little."
9498,LEELA,"OK. Let me just take the ship out to a safe distance.  Actually, I think I'll go down and prep the detonator. Fry, why don't you take the helm?"
9499,FRY,She's so great. I feel like I can almost remember the magical thing I did to make her love me. But I guess I never will.
9500,BENDER,"Sorry, buddy. I too know what it's like to have a dream I'll never achieve."
9501,FRY,Oh!  That's how I must have done it! I moved the stars themselves to write her a love note in the sky.
9502,LEELA,"Detonation in three, two, one."
9503,FRY,(screaming) Nooo!  Did you see it? Did you see it?
9504,BENDER,The explosion?
9505,FRY,"No, not the explosion!"
9506,LEELA,Then what?
9507,FRY,(quietly) Nothing.
9508,THE END,
9509,"""I DATED A ROBOT""",
9510,SMITH [ON TV],A casino where I'm winning? That car must've killed me. I must be in heaven! A casino where I always win? That's boring. I must really be...in hell!
9511,MAN [ON TV],No Mr Smith. You're not in heaven or hell. You're on an aeroplane.
9512,SMITH [ON TV],There's a gremlin destroying the plane! You've gotta believe me!
9513,MAN [ON TV],Why should I believe you? You're Hitler!
9514,SMITH [ON TV],No!  Eva Braun! Help me!
9515,BENDER,Saw it comin'!
9516,FRY,"I just saw something incredibly cool. A big floating ball that lit up with every colour of the rainbow, plus some new ones that were so beautiful I fell to my knees and cried."
9517,AMY,Was it out in front of Discount Shoe Outlet?
9518,FRY,Yeah.
9519,AMY,They have a college kid wear that to attract customers.
9520,FRY,Well I don't care if it was some dork in a costume. For one brief moment I felt the heartbeat of creation. And it was one with my own.
9521,AMY,Big deal.
9522,BENDER,We all feel like that all the time. You don't hear us gassin' on about it.
9523,FRY,"How can you people be so blase? Here you are in the year 3000 or so, yet you just sit around like its the boring time I came from."
9524,FARNSWORTH,Boring? Wasn't that the period where they cracked the human genome and boy bands roamed the Earth?
9525,FRY,Yeah. But now its the distant future. Why aren't we out doing everything I ever dreamed of?
9526,LEELA,"Hey, you know what might be fun?"
9527,FARNSWORTH,No. Why would I know that?
9528,LEELA,Let's take the rest of the morning off and take Fry to do everything he ever wanted to do.
9529,FRY,(sexfully) Everything?
9530,LEELA,Except that.
9531,SAL,Sos your fantasy's always been to destroys a planet huh?
9532,FRY,"Yeah, what did they ever do for me?"
9533,LEELA,"Wow, the most humdrum activities look almost exciting through your eyes. What should we do next?"
9534,FRY,I wanna see the edge of the universe!
9535,AMY,Ooo! That sounds cool.
9536,ZOIDBERG,"It's funny. You live in the universe, but you never do these things til somebody comes to visit."
9537,FRY,"Far out! So, there's an infinite number of parallel universes?"
9538,FARNSWORTH,"No, just the two."
9539,FRY,"Oh, well, I'm sure that's enough."
9540,BENDER,I'm sick of parallel Bender lording his cowboy head over me! Let's move on to Fry's next fantasy.
9541,FRY,"(shouting) Yeehah! Bow before your master, puny mortals! Whoo! Giddy-up! Ha ha! Woohoo! Whoopie!"
9542,GIRL,"Mommy, why is that man like that?"
9543,MOTHER,Don't look at him!
9544,FRY,That was fun. Let's give him a treat!
9545,LEELA,Keep your palms flat.
9546,FRY,The tongue tickles.
9547,FRY,These new hands are great. I'm gonna break them in tonight.
9548,FARNSWORTH,Yes it's been quite an hour and a half.
9549,FRY,I've only got two fantasies left: Be invisible in a chocolate factory and be romantically linked with a celebrity.
9550,BENDER,I could pound your head 'til you thinks that's what happened.
9551,FRY,
9552,LEELA,"Wait, hold on. It is actually possible to meet any celebrity you want."
9553,FRY,It is?
9554,LEELA,Of course! You should read a blimp sometime.
9555,FRY,Download a celebrity from the internet? What part of that do I understand?
9556,LEELA,It's simple. You can download a celebrity's personality and appearance into a blank robot.
9557,FRY,"Hey, I have an idea. Let's do that!"
9558,FARNSWORTH,Onto the internet you go!
9559,BENDER,Oh and while you're there pick me up a few credit card numbers.
9560,TREKKIE #1,No way! Kirk could kick Picard's ass!
9561,TREKKIE #2,"Eh, at least Picard had the guts to admit he was bald!"
9562,TREKKIE #1,You take that back!
9563,FRY,Ooo! eBay!
9564,AUCTIONEER,Are there no further bids for this exquisite galaxy?  Sold to the Being Of Inconceivable Horror.
9565,AUCTIONEER,Yes.
9566,FRY,So where's the celebrity dating place?
9567,LEELA,Let's search the web.  Over there.
9568,SALESMAN,Welcome to Nappster. Let's see what celebrities we've got in stock.  Can I interest you in Gwyneth Paltrow?
9569,FRY,Nah. I read in Newsweek that she drinks human blood.
9570,SALESMAN,"Then uh, how about Cleopatra? Who's beauty destroyed mighty empires."
9571,FRY,I'd prefer someone from the era of shaved underarms. Do you have anything with a more Lucy Liu feel to it?
9572,SALESMAN,"Nah, nothing like that. Though we do have Lucy Liu.  Only woman ever to be named People magazine's woman of the year twice. In 2003, and then again in 2063."
9573,FRY,I'd like the 2003 model.
9574,FRY,Wahoo! I've found her! What do I do now?
9575,FARNSWORTH,Download her. Let's just put a blank robot in the drive.
9576,FRY,It worked!
9577,LIUBOT,You're one sexy man (mechanical voice) Philip J. Fry!
9578,FRY,(muffled) It worked perfectly!
9579,LEELA,"Well, you downloaded Lucy Liu. Are you just going to stare vacantly at her and not say anything?"
9580,LIUBOT,I find your slack-jawed stare very attractive (mechanical voice) Philip J. Fry.
9581,FRY,Did you hear that? She likes me!
9582,FARNSWORTH,Well duh! She's programmed to like you!
9583,FRY,But this is Lucy Liu! Perhaps the only good actress of the 21st century! She's more than just a piece of software.
9584,LIUBOT,Would you like to take a moment to register me?
9585,FRY,"Uh, not right now."
9586,LIUBOT,I'll remind you later you hot stud you!
9587,FRY,"So uh, what do you feel like doing?"
9588,LIUBOT,Would you like to take a moment to register me?
9589,FRY,I said later!
9590,FRY,"Then when I feel so stuffed I can't eat anymore, I just use the restroom, and then I can eat more."
9591,LIUBOT,You should write a book Fry. People need to know about the (mechanical voice) can eat more.
9592,FRY,Oh Lucy! You're just like I always thought you'd be from your movies.
9593,LIUBOT,"My personality is mathematically derived from my movies, proportionally weighted by box office receipts."
9594,FRY,You're cute!
9595,LIUBOT,You're cute!
9596,FRY,You!
9597,LIUBOT,You!
9598,FRY,You!
9599,LIUBOT,You!
9600,FRY,You!
9601,FARNSWORTH,"Oh dear! She's stuck in an infinite loop and he's an idiot. Well, that's love for you."
9602,BENDER,Humans dating robots is sick. You people wonder why I'm still single?? It's 'cause all the fun robot sisters are dating humans!
9603,LEELA,"Bender, this is Fry's decision. And he made it wrong, so it's time for us to interfere in his life."
9604,LEELA,She doesn't really love you. She can't. She's just a machine that -
9605,FRY,"Well, so what if I love a robot? It's not hurting anybody."
9606,HERMES,My God! He never took middle school hygiene. He never saw the propaganda film.
9607,FARNSWORTH,It's just lucky I keep a copy in the VCR at all times!
9608,NARRATOR [IN MOVIE],"Ordinary human dating. It's enjoyable and it serves an important purpose. But when a human dates an artificial mate, there is no purpose. Only enjoyment. And that leads to...tragedy."
9609,BILLY [IN MOVIE],Neato! A Marylin Monroebot!
9610,MONROEBOT [IN MOVIE],Ooo! You're a real dreamboat (mechanical voice) Billy Everyteen!
9611,NARRATOR [IN MOVIE],Harmless fun? Let's see what happens next!
9612,BILLY [IN MOVIE],"No thank Mom, I'd rather make out with my Monroebot."
9613,BILLY [IN MOVIE],"No thanks dad, I'd rather make out with my Monroebot."
9614,MAVIS [IN MOVIE],"Billy, do you want to come over tonight? We can make out together."
9615,BILLY [IN MOVIE],"Gee Mavis, your house is across the street, that's an awfully long way to go for making out."
9616,NARRATOR [IN MOVIE],"Did you notice what went wrong in that scene? Ordinarily Billy would work hard to make money from his paper route then he'd use the money to buy dinner for Mavis, thus earning the slim chance of performing the reproductive act. But in a world where teens can date robots why should he bother? Why should anyone bother? Let's take a look at Billy's planet a year later.  Where are all the football stars?  And where are the biochemists?  They are trapped - trapped in a soft, vice-like grip of robot lips. All civilisation was just an effort to impress the opposite sex. And sometimes the same sex. Now, let's skip forward 80 years into the future. Where is Billy?"
9617,BILLY [IN MOVIE],Farewell!
9618,NARRATOR [IN MOVIE],The next day Billy's planet was destroyed by aliens.  Have you guessed the name of Billy's planet? It was Earth. Don't Date Robots!
9619,LEELA,Did that make any impression on you Fry? Fry?
9620,LIUBOT,Ooo!
9621,FARNSWORTH,I knew I should have shown him Electro Gonhorrhea: The Noisy Killer.
9622,BENDER,"What is the world coming to? That Fry's a sicko pervert I tell you, dating a robot. It's an atrosmacy."
9623,LEELA,But Fry's our friend Bender.
9624,BENDER,Aww jeez would you stifle there meatbag?
9625,LEELA,You stifle Bender.
9626,ZOIDBERG,Hooray! Finally you're standing up to him.
9627,LEELA,Although he is completely right.
9628,BENDER,We've got to stem this tidal wave of moral decay. It's time to shut down nappster.com!
9629,BENDER,Who's in charge of this dump?
9630,JERVIS,That'd be me. If you're an investor you can dump your money in the hole there.
9631,BENDER,Listen you fat internet nerd.
9632,JERVIS,Listening.
9633,BENDER,Your company promotes wrong love! If you don't shut down right now the only thing wired about you will be your jaw!
9634,JERVIS,You can't shut us down. The internet is about the free exchange and sale of other people's ideas. We've done nothing wrong!
9635,LIU [FROM ROOM],Help! I'm being held prisoner!
9636,ZOIDBERG,Someone in trouble is!
9637,JERVIS,No stay out! There's a guy going for the Tetris world record in there!
9638,WOMAN,Who are you?
9639,CHEECH,Don't hurt us!
9640,LIU,Help me! They've been holding me prisoner for 800 years!
9641,ZOIDBERG,The real Lucy Liu! The one you can see a movie of in the popcorn stadium!
9642,BENDER,So what's your problem?
9643,LIU,Those sweaty nerds are making illegal copies of us. (crying) It hurts!
9644,BENDER,Its a bluff.
9645,LEELA,We can't take that chance. Move people move!
9646,GEORGE MICHAEL,Please pick me up before you go go!
9647,LEELA,She asked first.
9648,NERD,"Uh, are you Lucy Liu?"
9649,ALBRIGHTBOT,Sure!
9650,JERVIS,"Oh we're doomed. They got the head, they uncovered the sign! Soon the whole world will learn we're cyber criminals! And we would have gotten away with it if it weren't for those meddling adults."
9651,MAN,"We'll stop them. They like Lucy Liu, we'll give them all the Lucy Liu they can handle! Hand me that backup disk."
9652,ZOIDBERG,Did you see me escaping? I was like -
9653,LIU,"Thanks for rescuing me, especially you Bender. (sexfully) Mmm, quite a masculine piece of metal aren't you?"
9654,BENDER,Hey don't look at me like that. If you're thinking of crossing the line with Bender you can forget it. Bender don't bend that way.
9655,LEELA,Hey look its another Lucy Liubot.
9656,LIUBOT #2,(mechanical voice) I am Lucy Liu. Give me your spines.
9657,ZOIDBERG,Hey what the?
9658,LIUBOT #2,(mechanical voice) Take this and that and one of these.
9659,LIU,Hey cut it out! I don't need this kind of publicity!
9660,LEELA,Alright Liu. Time to kick your frosty well toned ass! Heyya!
9661,BENDER,Then along came Bender!
9662,ZOIDBERG,Looks like you're retaining water.
9663,LIU,That was incredible Bender. You're like Jackie Chan before he got all doughy.
9664,BENDER,Aw shucks. I wasn't afraid of that robot. I'm pretty brave when you get past my macho exterior!  It's an army of Lucy Lius!
9665,LIU,They're horrible!
9666,LIUBOT #3,(mechanical voice) Robot Croucing Tiger.
9667,LIUBOT #4,(mechanical voice) Robot Crane style!
9668,ZAPP,Now that's a wave of destruction that's easy on the eyes.
9669,FRY,This is the best movie I've ever seen. It has a vampire and an explosion!
9670,LIUBOT,It's amazing the way you (mechanical voice) notice two things.
9671,ALEX [IN MOVIE],No! Don't open that coffin! It's ticking!
9672,NATALIE [IN MOVIE],I have to Alex. That coffin's not going to open itself!
9673,VAMPIRE [IN MOVIE],Bleurgh!
9674,LIU,Let's hide in here. It'll add to my box office gross!
9675,LEELA,Fry?
9676,FRY,"Aww, you guys came to watch me make out! That is so sweet.  Wait a minute! Is that the head of who I think it's of?"
9677,LIU,Read the jar Evelyn Wood! Dr Z?
9678,LEELA,"Fry, a herd of Lucy Liu are destroying the city. Is yours acting normally?"
9679,FRY,Let me see.  Yep. Why do you ask?
9680,ALEX [IN MOVIE],"Mr Mayor, if you want to see a real vampire look in the mirror!"
9681,MAYOR [IN MOVIE],I can't! I'm a vampire!
9682,ZOIDBERG,Why?
9683,LEELA,And Nappster says illegal copies never hurt anybody.
9684,FRY (SHOUTING),"Quick, this way!"
9685,FRY,"Sorry laides, employees only."
9686,LEELA,Oh no. They're forming a human pyramid...of robots.
9687,BENDER,Dammit! We weren't counting on them being as smart as they are sexy!
9688,LIU,A dangerous mistake to make.
9689,ZOIDBERG,At least we've got food.
9690,LEELA,Dr Zoidberg cut open that bag!
9691,ZOIDBERG,Hooray!
9692,LEELA,And don't eat it.
9693,ZOIDBERG,Life was bad but now its good forever!
9694,BENDER,You'll be safe in here sweetheart. Get lost Pavorotti!
9695,FRY,"Lucy Liubot, if I don't survive the corn I want you to know that I love you as much as a man can love a computerised image of gorgeous celebrity. Which it turns out is a lot."
9696,LIUBOT,"Oh Fry, I love you more than the moon and the stars and the (mechanincal voice) poetic image number 37 not found."
9697,FRY,What are you doing darling? Get down!
9698,FRY,You saved us. Are you alright?
9699,LIUBOT,Yes my love. I'll be just (mechanical voice) massive corn clog in port seven.
9700,LIU,Are you the last copy of me?
9701,LIUBOT,Yes.
9702,LIU,Erase her Fry.
9703,FRY,What?? No!
9704,LIU,"Fry, when you downloaded her without my permission you stole my image. And in the end that's all I really have. That and the largest gold nugget in the world - one mile in diameter."
9705,FRY,But I just downloaded her because I love you.
9706,LIU,"If you love the real Lucy Liu and not what you've seen in movies, genre stradling lawyer shows and kiss ass articles in People magazine, you'll blank out that robot."
9707,FRY,I'm sorry. Hug me Liubot.
9708,LIUBOT,I'll always remember you Fry (mechanical voice) memory deleted.
9709,BENDER,I know it hurts buddy. But at least you're not in a sick relationship with a robot anymore.
9710,FRY,Uh huh. And I guess now maybe I can get to know the real Lucy Liu.
9711,BENDER,Pft! Yeah at our wedding!
9712,LIU,It's true. Bender and I are in love.
9713,FRY,"But, but!"
9714,BENDER,Don't be a prude Fry!
9715,THE END,
9716,"""ROSWELL THAT ENDS WELL""",
9717,FRY,"I've never seen a supernova blow up. But if it's anything like my old Chevy Nova, it'll light up the night sky!"
9718,BENDER,"Yeah, anyone who misses this will regret it for the rest of his life! Hey Fry could you go make some popcorn?"
9719,FRY,
9720,FRY,"Let's go microwave, I'm in a hurry here! Hm?  Hey, what smells like blue?"
9721,LEELA,Fry get up here it's starting!
9722,FARNSWORTH,Focus!
9723,BENDER,Aw no!
9724,FRY,"Hey, which crazy thing happening are you guys screaming about?"
9725,ZOIDBERG,Oooh my head is spinning.
9726,FRY,Ooo my popcorn's done!
9727,FRY,"Aw, it's less popped than ever."
9728,LEELA,I don't know what happened but we've taken on a lot of clocks.  Let's get back home.
9729,LEELA,Why is there so little traffic around Earth?
9730,FARNSWORTH,And what's this layer of ozone? That's never been there before.
9731,ZOIDBERG,Such noises!
9732,LEELA,Oh no! There's no global positioning signal! Navigation is failing!
9733,FRY,We're gonna crash!
9734,LEELA,"Not if I can help it!  Oh, I guess I can't. Everyone put on your seatbelts."
9735,BENDER,Ah those things cost more lives than they save.
9736,FRY,"Bender, are you OK?"
9737,BENDER,I dunno. I'll try to move my feet.
9738,LEELA,"Alright, here's the plan. Zoidberg, pick up the pieces. Everyone else, take five."
9739,ZOIDBERG,"And Zoidberg picks up another piece, the crowd goes wild!!"
9740,MAN,General in all my years of covering top secret discoveries with sheets I've never dramatically revealed anything as shocking as this. Dun-dun-dunnn! The debris from an alien spaceship!
9741,GENERAL,Son I think I can safely say (shouting) whoaaaa!
9742,MAN,"As you can see, 1947 is going to be an eventful year for the town of...Roswell, New Mexico!"
9743,FARNSWORTH,Remarkable! According the high precision digital chronograph it's July 9th 1947. Which would explain why the chronograph has turned into this pin-up calendar.
9744,BENDER,Wait a second. You mean we travelled through time?
9745,FARNSWORTH,Doy! Some idiot must have put metal in the microwave...
9746,FRY,Yo!
9747,FARNSWORTH,...and the microwave's radiation combined with the gravitons and graviolis from the supernova blasted us through Time itself.
9748,LEELA,Have you seen today's news?
9749,BENDER,High school gym renovations on schedule? What a load!
9750,LEELA,No over here!  Flying Saucer Captured!
9751,BENDER,"That's no flying saucer, that's my ass!"
9752,FRY,My God! This mean the flying saucer that crashed in Roswell...was...us!
9753,FARNSWORTH,And the alien they captured was...was...
9754,ZOIDBERG,Hello!
9755,GENERAL,Eurgh!
9756,ZOIDBERG,So what are you guys doing tonight? I'm up for whatever.
9757,FARNSWORTH,Yes we tore the universe a new space-hole alright! But it's clenching shut fast. Our only hope of getting back to our own time is to go through it in oh say......exactly 24 hours.
9758,LEELA,No problem. The ship's fixed except for the cup holder and I think I can have that operational within 10 hours.
9759,FARNSWORTH,You've got 8. But a more urgent concern is the microwave.  Without a working one we have no hope of returning to the future.
9760,LEELA,"Well, I'm sure we can buy a microwave from somewhere around here.  Meanwhile you guys sneak onto the army base and rescue Bender's body."
9761,FRY,"Hey, and while we're on the base I'll visit my grandfather Enos! He was stationed at Roswell."
9762,FARNSWORTH,"Your grandfather?  Stay away from him you dimwitted monkey. You mustn't interfere with the past. Don't do anything that affects anything, unless it turns out you were supposed to do it. In which case. for the love of God, don't not do it!"
9763,FRY,Got it.
9764,FARNSWORTH,"If for example you were to kill your grandfather, you would cease to exist!"
9765,FRY,But existing is basically all I do!
9766,GENERAL,What is your purpose here?
9767,ZOIDBERG (DROWSY),Alright officer I'll move along.
9768,MAN,"What the General means is, why did you come to Earth?"
9769,ZOIDBERG,Not a day goes by I don't ask myself the same question.
9770,SERGEANT (SHOUTING),"Enos!  Private, I want that toilet bowl so clean I could eat off it! Cos I intend to!"
9771,ENOS,Well gadzooks Sarge!
9772,FRY,It's him! It's my grandfather Enos.
9773,SERGEANT,...Now prepare my lunch and place it in the latrine at twelve hundred hours!
9774,FRY,That jeep's gonna hit him! And I won't exist anymore!  Are you crazy? You almost got yourself run over!
9775,ENOS,I did? Then I sure am lucky you knocked me onto this pile of rusty bayonets!
9776,BENDER,Fry! Stop interfering with history! I don't wanna have to memorise a lot of new kings when I get back!
9777,FRY (WHISPERING),"I had no choice. I was about to not exist. I could feel myself fading away, like Greg Kinnear."
9778,ENOS,"Well, thanks soldier. I'm off to make Sarge's lunch! Handling raw chicken? It's part of the job!  Mmm! Finger licking good!"
9779,FRY,That's it! This place is too dangerous. We've gotta get you out of here!  Everything's gonna be alright Dad!
9780,ENOS,Well gadzooks I'd better ask Sarge.
9781,FRY (SHOUTING),No time! Run! Run to safety!
9782,MAN,"This food will determine what food, if any, the alien eats."
9783,ZOIDBERG,A buffet! Oh if only I had my wallet with me.
9784,MAN,"Um, it's free."
9785,GENERAL,Get me the president.
9786,LEELA,"Fry's from around this time, I'll talk like him."
9787,LEELA,Yo homes! We're looking for a microwave oven.
9788,SALESMAN,"Microwave? Never heard of that brand sweetheart.  What you want is the Deuluxe Gas Princess. This baby has four broilers, a gaserrole indicator, a fold out ironing board and down here...a foot soaking tub. Since as a woman you'll be standing in front of it all day."
9789,LEELA,"Oh I'm sorry, now I'll ax you again: Where can we find a mi-cro-wave?"
9790,SALESMAN,Sir you're wife's hysterical. So I'll address this to you. This oven is lightning fast. It takes only 5 hours to cook a roast.
9791,FARNSWORTH,Ooo that's good news! You know you really don't cook enough roast Leela!  Ooo. Women!
9792,FRY,Thank God I got you off that dangerour army base!
9793,ENOS,"You sure are the helpful type stranger! Say, you got anything to eat in that there lunchbox?  Ooo! Snack!"
9794,BENDER,"Hey, that's my brain..."
9795,ENOS,"Man, them crackers cut my mouth up somethin' bad! Let's stop off for a malt!"
9796,ENOS,See that waitress there?
9797,FRY,Yowza! I know what I want for dessert!
9798,ENOS,That's my fiance! Mildred.
9799,FRY,"Grandma Mildred?! Uh, no dessert, just coffee."
9800,MILDRED,Okie doke.  And for you snuggums?
9801,ENOS,"Uh, I'll have a pie with a fried egg on top."
9802,FRY,Eh she sure is pretty. You ought to marry her and father some children right away!
9803,ENOS,Yeah folks say that. But did you ever get the feeling you're only going with girls cos you're supposed to?
9804,FRY,What?? Don't ever say or think that again! Please. Just concentrate on staying alive!  Fire! Look out!  Oh! You almost got neutered.
9805,ENOS,"Well, it ain't as bad as getting killed!"
9806,FRY,For me it is!  I'm getting you out of here!
9807,FRY,"OK, we're in the middle of nowhere, which is the safest part of nowhere. Just stay put and enjoy this calendar."
9808,FRY,Safe and sound! Finally I can continue to exist!
9809,MAN,3. 2. 1.
9810,BENDER,And you are outta here!
9811,MILDRED,What'll you folks have today?
9812,FARNSWORTH,"I'll have the soylent green, with a slice of soylent orange and some soylent coleslaw."
9813,MILDRED,Pardon?
9814,LEELA (WHISPERING),It's the 20th century Professor.
9815,FARNSWORTH,"Oh right!  I'll have a croque monsieur, the paella, two mutton pills and a stein of mead!"
9816,LEELA,I'll just have a small injection of femislim.
9817,MILDRED,"Uh, two chilli dogs comin' up."
9818,LEELA,"Well, settle in. Without a microwave we're trapped in this time period."
9819,FARNSWORTH,"Oh Lord! We'll have to endure the horrible music of the big bopper, and then the terrible tragedy of his death."
9820,LEELA,Wait a second. There's a microwave radar dish at the army base. We could steal it!
9821,FARNSWORTH,"No! That would alter history. Above all else, it is our sacred duty to preserve the past exactly as it was."
9822,FRY,"Well, I killed my grandfather."
9823,FARNSWORTH,Wha?
9824,LEELA,Wait. If you killed your grandfather then why do you stll exist?
9825,FRY,I dunno. Maybe God loves me.
9826,MILDRED,"Killed? In an atomic blast? No sir, I'm afraid I don't take much solace in the fact that the implosion trigger functioned perfectly"
9827,FRY,"Aww. There there. If it makes you feel any better, his body was vapourised so there's no chance of him coming back as a zombie."
9828,MILDRED (CRYING),I'm not worried about that.
9829,FRY,Then you're a braver woman than I.
9830,MILDRED,You remind me of Enos. Would you mind walking me home?
9831,FRY,"Uh, how far is it?"
9832,GENERAL,Welcome to Roswell President Truman.
9833,TRUMAN,"Fellas, this visit's top secret. No one's to know about it, except the senior officers,  the scientists  and a single conspiracy nutter no one will believe."
9834,GENERAL,"Mr President, our men have assembled the parts of the alien ship into it's original design."
9835,TRUMAN,Whistling Dixie! I want this sent to Area 51 for study.
9836,GENERAL,"But sir, that's where we're building the fake moon landing set."
9837,TRUMAN,Then we'll really have to land on the moon. Invent NASA and tell them to get off their fanny's!
9838,TRUMAN,"If you come in peace, surrender or be destroyed. If you're here to make war, we surrender."
9839,ZOIDBERG,"Both good, the important thing is I'm meeting new people."
9840,TRUMAN,Bushwa! Now what's your mission? Are you planning on making some sort of alien-human hybrid?
9841,ZOIDBERG,Are you coming onto me?
9842,TRUMAN,Hot crackers I take exception to that!
9843,ZOIDBERG (SEXFULLY),I'm not hearing a no.
9844,TRUMAN,"Nuts to this space crap! If we want information, we'll have to do us an old fashioned alien autopsy!"
9845,ZOIDBERG,Hooray!
9846,MILDRED (CRYING),Every little thing reminds me of Enos.
9847,FRY,Aww I know how you feel. My grandfather died recently.
9848,MILDRED,"It's all so sad. At times like this, I just need someone to hold me. Mmm. You like holding me don't you?"
9849,FRY,"Hey, you know what always cheers you up? Baking me a nice tray of sugar cookies!"
9850,MILDRED,How 'bout these cookies sugar?
9851,FRY,I shouldn't be here. I shouldn't even exist. But I do which proves...you can't really be my grandm -
9852,LEELA [FROM OUTSIDE],Eurgh!
9853,FARNSWORTH,What the hell have you done Fry?
9854,FRY,Relax! She can't be my grandmother! I figured it all out.
9855,MILDRED,Come back to bed deary!
9856,FRY,"It's impossible! I mean, if she's my grandmother, who's my grandfather?"
9857,MILDRED,Did you say something deary? I'm a bit hard of hearing.
9858,DOCTOR #2,Heart.
9859,ZOIDBERG,"Take, I've got four of them."
9860,DOCTOR #1,Stomach contents: One deviled egg.
9861,ZOIDBERG,Deviled egg?
9862,DOCTOR #1,The same deviled egg.
9863,LEELA,Snap out of it!
9864,FARNSWORTH,Start the ship Leela. Let's just steal the damned radar dish and get back to our own time!
9865,FRY,But...but won't that change history?
9866,FARNSWORTH,Oh a lesson in not changing history from Mr I'm-My-Own-Grandpa! Let's get the hell out of here already! Screw history!
9867,CONSPIRACY NUTTER,
9868,ZOIDBERG,Hey don't cut that! I need that to speak!
9869,DOCTOR #2,Oh my!
9870,TRUMAN,Sweet Roosevelt's ghost!
9871,LEELA,Heyya!  Ya!  Ya!
9872,FRY,"Take this Mr President, sir!"
9873,ZOIDBERG,The President is gagging on my gas bladder! What an honour!
9874,FARNSWORTH,Huh wha? Oh right!
9875,SERGEANT (SHOUTING),Enos!
9876,FRY [FROM SHIP],"He's dead, sorry."
9877,FRY,Yay!
9878,FARNSWORTH,Choke on that causality!
9879,BENDER,1947 can kiss my shiny metal...
9880,FRY,Turn around. We've gotta go back for Bender!
9881,FARNSWORTH,"Impossible. The supernova timehole is closing! If we don't leave now, we'll never get back to the 31st century!"
9882,FRY [FROM INSIDE],Bendeeeeer!
9883,ZOIDBERG,"There, good as new!"
9884,LEELA,Don't you need this one?
9885,ZOIDBERG,Oh no! That's my... Gotcha!
9886,FRY,"Oh, poor Bender. He must be so lonely right now. Trapped a thousand years in the past. Hey! Wait a second!"
9887,LEELA,Anything?
9888,FRY,No.  Wait!
9889,BENDER [FROM GROUND],Ow! Stupid junk!
9890,FRY,He's alive!  Bender. What was it like lying in that hole for a thousand years?
9891,BENDER,I was enjoying it until you guys showed up.
9892,FARNSWORTH,"Well, now everything is back as it was. And if history doesn't care that out degenerate friend Fry is his own grandfather, then who are we to judge?"
9893,BENDER,Amen!
9894,THE END,
9895,"""A TALE OF TWO SANTAS""",
9896,LINDA,"In what has become a winter tradition, members of the Zarlon 7 Polar Bear Club today took the plunge into a river of liquid ammonia."
9897,MORBO,There were no survivors.
9898,LINDA,"Takes all kinds! And now, with his annual Xmas Message, here's the head of the Xmas Safety Council, the head of Walter Cronkite."
9899,CRONKITE,"Seasons warnings, Linda and Morbo."
9900,BENDER,This guy's too trustworthy. What's his angle?
9901,CRONKITE,"In all the tinsel and terror of the holiday season we too often underestimate that murderous brute better known as Santa Claus. With images of last year's gingerbread massacre freshly baked into our memories, I remind you to bolt your doors, say goodbye to your pets and lock your children in the closet. This is Walter Cronkite saying ""I told you so""."
9902,HERMES,Sacred ball of West and Eastern Samoa. We've got to secure for Santa's arrival.
9903,FRY,Just as well. I'm getting tired of this wood show.
9904,FARNSWORTH,"Cover that fireplace, confound you! I've only a few years to live. I don't wanna spend them dead."
9905,LEELA,We're pushing as hard as we can.
9906,BENDER,Oh! Pushing!
9907,FARNSWORTH,"Oh, we're doomed! Every year we're doomed. Thanks be I had these bullet-proof shutters installed."
9908,FARNSWORTH,"Bring it on, Santa! That bloodthirsty cadaver junkie can't touch us as long as we're not stupid enough to leave this building."
9909,FRY,Alright!
9910,LEELA,Yeah!
9911,FARNSWORTH,"In a related matter, you'll be delivering this sack of children's letters directly to Santa at his death fortress on Neptune."
9912,FRY,These letters are real butt-nutters! Listen to this one: (reading) Dear Santa.
9913,GIRL,"(thinking and writing) Please, please don't bring me any gifts. The bicycle you fired at me last year from your bicycle gun really tore up my insides."
9914,LEELA,Awful! Let's read some more. (reading) Dear Santa.
9915,BOY,(thinking and writing) Please bring me a coffin for Grandpa. You choked him with a chestnut last year and he's beginning to smell a lot like Xmas if you know what I mean.
9916,FRY,"It's not fair. In my day Xmas was supposed to bring people together, not blow them apart!"
9917,BENDER,"Sure, but who's going to do anything about it? Certainly not us. No, sir!"
9918,FRY,"Certainly yes us! Uh-huh, sir! We've gotta bring back the kind of Xmas I remember."
9919,LEELA,Fry's right. It's time to sit on Santa's lap -- and hard!
9920,LEELA,"Oh, look! A cute little welcoming party."
9921,NEPTUNIAN #1,Hey! Wanna buy a tiny little kidney?
9922,NEPTUNIAN #2,I'll let you punch me for a buck.
9923,FRY,"Uh, look, we've got mail for Santa. Are you his elves?"
9924,NEPTUNIAN #2,We're not elves. We're Neptunians.
9925,NEPTUNIAN #1,We're just shrimp-y because he doesn't feed us.
9926,NEPTUNIAN #2,You hit me! You owe me a dollar.
9927,NEPTUNIAN #3,"Hey, you got any food? Old teabags, chewed gum, apple cores? Come on! We're starving here!"
9928,FRY,But you live in a gingerbread house.
9929,NEPTUNIAN #4,"Hey! It's food or shelter, not both."
9930,BENDER,You lazy runts! Don't you get paid for making the toys?
9931,NEPTUNIAN #4,"Who said ""toys""?"
9932,NEPTUNIANS,"Toys? Toys? Who said ""toys""?"
9933,NEPTUNIAN #2,"False alarm, folks! There's no reason to make toys since Santa judges everyone to be naughty."
9934,FRY,That's it! I'm gonna deliver a gift of my boot up Santa's chimney. Where is he?
9935,NEPTUNIAN #2,There! In his ice fortress.
9936,LEELA,We'll need help getting in. Any volunteers?
9937,NEPTUNIAN #1,I'll help you!
9938,NEPTUNIAN #2,"Ah, phooey!"
9939,NEPTUNIAN #2,An omen?
9940,NEPTUNIAN #1,Dinner!
9941,SANTA,"Let's see who's been naughty, and who's been naughty!  Mobsters beating up a shopkeeper for protection money. Very naughty!  Shopkeeper's not paying their protection money. Exactly as naughty! I saw that!  Huh?"
9942,NEPTUNIAN #2,We brought your mail.
9943,SANTA,"Don't you ever knock? Who knows what naughty things I could be watching? I get New Orleans on this thing, you know!"
9944,NEPTUNIAN #2,Don't kill us!
9945,LEELA,"Santa's a robot, so we should be able to destroy him with a logical paradox. Bender, you'd better cover your ears."
9946,SANTA,Holy night! Intruders!
9947,LEELA,"Hold it Santa!  Consider this: You are programmed to destroy the naughty. But many of those you destroy are in fact, nice. I submit to you, that you are naughty, and logically, you must destroy yourself."
9948,SANTA,Nice try. But my head was built with paradox-absorbing crumple-zones.
9949,LEELA,Wait! This is what we're running from!
9950,FRY,Faster! Faster!
9951,FRY,Why aren't we moving?
9952,LEELA,I don't know. Usually when I do stuff like this the ship moves.
9953,SANTA,Ho ho-- Eh?
9954,FRY,He's trapped!
9955,NEPTUNIAN #2,Now we can make toys again!
9956,NEPTUNIANS,(chanting) Toys! Toys! Toys!
9957,FRY,And I can deliver them. Billions and billions in one night.
9958,SANTA,Hah! No human could do all that.
9959,FRY,Evil Knievel could!
9960,SANTA,Nuh-uh!
9961,BENDER,"Santa's right. We need some sort of robot.  Aw, crap! I'm some sort of robot."
9962,NEPTUNIANS,Hooray!  Hooray!  Hooray!
9963,SANTA,Bender can't be Santa! He wasn't built to Yuletide specifications.
9964,BENDER,"Oh, yeah? Well I wasn't built to steal Leela's purse either.  But that didn't stop me."
9965,LEELA,Bender!
9966,BENDER,Bow to your new Santa!
9967,NEPTUNIANS,Our hero!
9968,NEPTUNIANS,"(singing) We are free and fairly sober,"
9969,NEPTUNIANS,"(singing) The machines are kinda tricky,"
9970,FRY,(singing) Which is good because we don't intend to pay.
9971,ALL,(singing) The elves are back to work today!
9972,NEPTUNIANS,(singing) Hooray!
9973,LEELA,"(singing) Then you'll all work triple shifts,"
9974,FRY LEELA AND BENDER,(singing) It's back to work on Xmas Eve!
9975,NEPTUNIANS,(cheering) Hooray!
9976,LEELA,"(singing) And though you're cold and sore and ugly,"
9977,NEPTUNIAN,(singing) There's a toy lodged in my brain!
9978,NEPTUNIANS,"(singing) We are getting awfully tired,"
9979,BENDER,"(singing) Why you selfish little bastards,"
9980,NEPTUNIAN,Ow!
9981,BENDER,(singing) Then shut your yaps and back to work.
9982,NEPTUNIANS,"(singing) Now it's very nearly Xmas,"
9983,FRY,"(singing) These toys soldiers are poorly painted,"
9984,LEELA,(singing) And they're made from inferior wood.
9985,BENDER,"(singing) I should give you all a beating,"
9986,SANTA,"(singing) If I weren't stuck here frozen,"
9987,NEPTUNIANS,"(singing) Now its back into our tenements,"
9988,LEELA,"(singing) You did the best you could, br>I guess that some of these gorillas are OK,"
9989,NEPTUNIAN,We're adequate!
9990,ALL,(singing) The elves have rescued Xmas Day! Hooray!
9991,BENDER,"(stupid voice) Duh! Gee, Bender, how you gonna get through these bars? (normal voice) I dunno, moron, suppose I bend them? (stupid voice) Duh, OK!"
9992,GIRL,Mommy! Mommy! Santa's through the perimeter!
9993,MRS. GRANT,"This is it, kids. Take your suicide pills so you won't suffer."
9994,BENDER,"No, wait! I'm the good Santa. I've got toys ... at very reasonable prices!"
9995,JEFFERY,Don't listen to him. He's the father of all lies and the uncle of all tricks!
9996,BENDER,But I come bearing Tri-ominos!
9997,MRS. GRANT,Go for the shins!
9998,BENDER,(groaning) One down...
9999,PETUNIA,"Well, hello there, handsome!  Won't you have a cookie?"
10000,BENDER,"Uh, don't mind if I do.  Ow! What's in these things?"
10001,PETUNIA,Why don't you slip into something more fiery?
10002,BENDER,Ow!
10003,KWANZAABOT,"Yo, Kringle! What happened to you, doll?"
10004,BENDER,"Oh, it's awful, Kwanzabot. Everyone hates me."
10005,KWANZAABOT,"At least they understand you, you know what I'm sayin'? Ain't nobody down with this Kwanza tip."
10006,BENDER,Hey! Maybe you could lend me a hand with these deliveries.
10007,KWANZAABOT,No time! I gotta hand out the traditional Kwanzaa book.  I've been givin' these out for 647 years!
10008,FRY,Ah! Bathtub eggnog! Just the way Grandma used to drink.  Ew! It went sour!
10009,ZOIDBERG,Can't I have a scented bath in peace?
10010,LEELA,"Remember, Professor: Bender is Santa. So we don't need to hurt him, right?"
10011,FARNSWORTH,"Yes, yes, yes. You sound like a broken mp3!"
10012,BENDER,Ho ho--  Ow!
10013,LEELA,(shouting) Professor! Don't you remember what I told you?
10014,FARNSWORTH,(shouting) No!
10015,BENDER,"(crying) Oh, there's gotta be a better way."
10016,BENDER,Bender you're a genius!
10017,VYOLET,This creates and unrealistic standard of beauty!
10018,BENDER,Now it's time for Santa to screw open his present!
10019,SMITTY,It's Santa! And we got him cornered!
10020,URL,"Aw, I smell a juicy promotion for me."
10021,SMITTY,And a juicy re-hiring-back-onto-the-force for me!
10022,BAILIFF,This Xmas Day session of court will come to order. The Honourable Judge Whitey presiding.
10023,WHITEY,"Santa Claus, you stand accused of crimes against humanity. How do you plead?"
10024,BENDER,Not Santa!
10025,FARNSWORTH,There he is again!
10026,HYPER-CHICKEN,"Now, Pramala, I know it's scary in that there witness box but t'ain't no need to fear me.  I'm sorry, I thought you was corn. Now, would you please point at that robot over there.  No further questions.  Daddy done good, huh?"
10027,BENDER,Isn't it true that you have been paid for your testimony?
10028,PRAMALA,Yes. You gave me a dollar and some candy.
10029,BENDER,And yet you haven't said what I told you to say. How can any of us trust you?
10030,WHITEY,Quit badgering the witness!
10031,HYPER-CHICKEN,Badger? Where?
10032,WHITEY,"Whereas I have a ham dinner with mayonnaise waiting for me at my mansion, I find the defendant guilty.  Santa Claus, I hereby sentence you to be executed at sundown."
10033,LEELA,It's not fair. I just hope that dumb chicken is ashamed of himself.
10034,SMITTY,Deactivated robot walking. We got a deactivated robot walking here.
10035,ROBOT,"Hey, Santa, when you see the Robot Devil, tell him I'm-a comin'!"
10036,BENDER,"Hey, that guy said to tell you that--"
10037,ROBOT DEVIL,I heard him!
10038,NEPTUNIAN #1,"Greetings, masters. My companion and I made lots of toys."
10039,LEELA,"Outta my way, shrimp-oh. We're here to bring Santa back so we can prove Bender's innocent."
10040,SANTA,Do what you will. But we'll see who has the last ho.
10041,LEELA,There.
10042,FRY,"Oh, no! The ice is melting!"
10043,LEELA,The pollution from the factory. It caused a greenhouse effect.
10044,NEPTUNIAN #1,That would explain this heat.
10045,FRY,And your breezy short-shorts!
10046,NEPTUNIAN #2,"Uh, yeah! That would explain it."
10047,FRY,Hurry! We've gotta think of another way to save Bender or Xmas will be ruined!
10048,LEELA,Especially for Bender.
10049,SANTA,"Look out, Earth. I'm dreaming of a red Xmas."
10050,POOPENMEYER,"Ah, good old Maggie!  Eh? When I pull this switch, these powerful electromagnets will tear you limb-from-limb, killing you in the most humane possible manner."
10051,BENDER,"But, Mr. Mayor, that doesn't sound humane."
10052,POOPENMEYER,"It is for the witnesses because it's not boring!  The instant this random number generator reaches zero, you'll be executed."
10053,BENDER,Aw!
10054,POOPENMEYER,Ten. Three. Twelve. Three again.
10055,LEELA,Stop the execution!
10056,BENDER,Leela!
10057,POOPENMEYER,Fifteen. Negative eight.
10058,LEELA,You got the wrong Santa. And I'll prove it.
10059,FRY,I'm Santa Claus!
10060,POOPENMEYER,What? Twenty-seven.
10061,HERMES,No. I'm Santa Claus.
10062,POOPENMEYER,Six.
10063,AMY,"(disguised, deeper voice) We're also Santa Claus."
10064,ZOIDBERG,And I'm his friend Jesus!
10065,FRY,"Your Mayorness, if you execute him, you have to execute all of us."
10066,POOPENMEYER,You people aren't Santa. You're not even robots! Ninety-one. How dare you lie in front of Jesus!  Hey! Zero!
10067,BENDER,"No! Not the magnets!  (singing) Swing low, sweet chariot, coming for to carry me home.  Swing low sweet--"
10068,FRY,This is horrible.
10069,FARNSWORTH,But it's not boring!
10070,SANTA,Ho ho ho!
10071,POOPENMEYER,"My God! The real Santa! Get him, Jesus!"
10072,ZOIDBERG,I help those who help themselves.
10073,BENDER,Santa! You saved my life. Please don't kill me!
10074,SANTA,"I'm not here to kill you, Bender! I need you to help me save Xmas."
10075,BENDER,"Gee whiz, Santa! You want me to help you?"
10076,FRY,Don't do it! He's evil!
10077,SANTA,"I know he is but I have no choice. I'm running late and if I don't complete my brutal rampage, well, it just wouldn't be Xmas. I guess what I'm asking is: Bender, won't you join my slaying tonight?"
10078,BENDER,Well ... 'tis the season!
10079,MAN,My hair!
10080,WOMAN,My wedding cake!
10081,SANTA,Let it snow!
10082,BENDER,"Merry Xmas, kids!"
10083,LEELA,"This wangs chun! After all the good we tried to do, Xmas turned out as rotten as ever."
10084,FARNSWORTH,No heat.
10085,AMY,No power.
10086,HERMES,Huddled together in fear like lice in a burning wig.
10087,FRY,Wait a second! Maybe your futuristic Xmas isn't so rotten after all.
10088,LEELA,"What are you talking about, you crouton? You said it yourself: Xmas should be about bringing people together, not blowing them apart."
10089,FRY,But don't you see? Fear has brought us together. That's the magic of Xmas!
10090,FARNSWORTH,That's a big crock of--  Hold me!
10091,BENDER,"On, Trasher! On, Smasher!  Hey, Kwanzaabot, where you off to?"
10092,KWANZAABOT,"Ah, you didn't hear about it? Chanukah Zombie's having a luau at the B'nai Brith! You comin'?"
10093,BENDER,Word!
10094,SANTA,"By the way, Bender, here's a small token of my appreciation for being Santa while I was trapped in the ice."
10095,BENDER,"Hey, chief, you screwed up. There's nothing in here."
10096,SANTA,"Oh, it might appear empty but the message is clear: Play Santa again and I'll kill you next year!  Ho ho ho!"
10097,THE END,
10098,"""ANTHOLOGY OF INTEREST II""",
10099,FARNSWORTH,"There. I've finished fine tuning my What If? machine. It can answer any What If? question, accurate to within 1/10th of a plausibility unit."
10100,LEELA,That's so plausible I can't believe it!
10101,FARNSWORTH,Who wants the machine to show them an alternate reality?
10102,BENDER,"I wanna know what would happen if I were human. I mean, being a robot's great but we don't have emotions and sometimes that makes me very sad."
10103,FARNSWORTH,"Oh lordy loo! There he goes again. Well, let's give baby what he wants.  What if Bender were human?"
10104,FARNSWORTH,"Good news everyone. I've discovered a way to make Bender human using a process I call ""reverse fossilisation."""
10105,LEELA,How does it work?
10106,FARNSWORTH,"Well, in regular fossilisation, flesh and bone turn to minerals. Realising that, it was a simple matter to reverse the process. I've already tested it by turning the toaster into a racoon."
10107,FRY,Kinda gamey.
10108,FARNSWORTH,Are you ready Bender?
10109,BENDER,I dunno. I'm beginning to have second thoughts -
10110,HERMES,Cover your shame mon!
10111,FARNSWORTH,It worked! Eat it everyone who never won a Nobel Prize! And that includes you Amy!
10112,BENDER,"So this is the human body huh? Neat! Hey, my antenna's gone.  Nah it just moved. I'm not getting good reception on it though. Maybe if I wiggle it around a little."
10113,FRY (WHISPERING),Bender no! You'll make God cry.
10114,BENDER,Well lets see what kind of things thing body can do.  Hey that's pretty fun. Being human is great!
10115,ZOIDBERG,"Hooray, its just like Mardis Gras!"
10116,BENDER,"Guy guys, you've gotta see this. You're not gonna believe it!"
10117,LEELA,Bender it's OK to be pround but don;t be a show off.
10118,BENDER,"Whoa, you look a lot better than you used to for some reason."
10119,AMY (SEXFULLY),You're not so bad yourself big boy.
10120,BENDER,Hey that felt great!  Nah its not working anymore.
10121,FARNSWORTH,Speak for yourself!
10122,BENDER,"Whoa, this is awesome!"
10123,LEELA,Bender you drank and smoked when you were a robot.
10124,BENDER,But now its bad for me! Woo!
10125,FRY,"Speaking of which, try these nachos."
10126,BENDER,"Mmm, why didn't anyone tell me tasting things tasted so good?  What's going on? That rhythm. Its doing something to my human butt."
10127,AMY,"Bender, part of being human is having self control."
10128,BENDER,Oh my God I bet I can eat nachos and go to the bathroom at the same time!
10129,AMY,No Bender.
10130,HERMES,No!
10131,LEELA,Stop him.
10132,BENDER,Let me go.
10133,LEELA,No.
10134,FARNSWORTH,"Come Bender, its time to go home and rest. I need you in top shape next week when I present you to the Nobel Prize committee. Bender?"
10135,BENDER (SHOUTING),Goodbye moderation!
10136,ZOIDBERG,Is Bender still missing for a week? Where is he already?
10137,FARNSWORTH,"Uh as I've said before, I used reverse fossilisation, which is the reverse of regular, uh..."
10138,FRY (WHISPERING),"Psst, we found him!"
10139,FARNSWORTH,"Ah, them without further stalling for time, I present to the Nobel judges, the first robot ever turned into a human."
10140,WERNSTRUM,"My God, he needs medical attention!"
10141,ZOIDBERG,"Pulse...300, liver...failing, cholesterol...40?"
10142,LEELA,Well that's not so bad.
10143,ZOIDBERG,No I mean 40 pounds!
10144,FARNSWORTH,"This, uh, scientific breakthrough, uh, heralds a new dawn in human-robot relations yes."
10145,BENDER,"C'mere and give old Bender a kiss. Hey, you like grilled cheese?"
10146,FARNSWORTH,"And, uh thats why I believe I deserve the Nobel Prize."
10147,WERNSTRUM,Not only do you not deserve a Nobel Prize for loosing this bloated man-ball on the world but you are hereby kicked out of the Academy Of Science.
10148,BENDER,"Wait. As men of science are not your minds open to new ideas? I say, do not judge me until you have tried my way of life for yourselves."
10149,WERNSTRUM,"Young man, you have opened our minds and swayed our hearts. Let us therefore -"
10150,BENDER (SHOUTING),Party!
10151,FARNSWORTH,Weee!
10152,WERNSTRUM,"Bender, you were right! Truly you have lived more in your one week of being human than the rest of us have in our entire lives."
10153,BENDER,Woo!
10154,WERNSTRUM,And so to recognise your achievements I hereby award you the Nobel Prize......in uh......chemistry!
10155,FARNSWORTH,Care to say a few words Bender?
10156,FRY,He's dead.
10157,WERNSTRUM,When did he die?
10158,FARNSWORTH,About 12 hours ago when the party started.
10159,WERNSTRUM,"But he just said ""Woo."""
10160,FARNSWORTH,No. That was air escaping from the folds of his fat.  Goodnight sweet prince. You were the greatest man any of us will ever know. Well lets get him out of here. He's starting to smell up the joint.
10161,NARRATOR,"You watched it, you can't unwatch it. Stay tuned for more Tales Of Interest!"
10162,FARNSWORTH,Who else has a question for the What If? machine? Scruffy? Katrina? Xanfor?
10163,FRY,Ooo I have one. I'm good at video games and bad at everything else. That's why I wish life were more like a video game.
10164,FARNSWORTH,Can you put that in the form of a question?
10165,FRY,"Uh, What if that thing I said?"
10166,FARNSWORTH,Oh great machine we beseech thee. What if life were more like a video game?
10167,NIXON [ON TV],Good evening ignorant pigs. Put down your crack pipes and you beer bongs and pay attention as I sign a historic peace accord with Ambassador Kong of planet Nintendu 64.
10168,FRY,"Wait a second, I know that monkey. His name is Donkey."
10169,FARNSWORTH,Monkies aren't donkies! Quit messing with my head!
10170,NIXON,I'll just put the old John Q. Nixon on it.  There. No major crap ups. You're on Mr Ambassador!  What the?
10171,MARIO,Mama Mia! The cruel meatball of war has rolled onto our laps and ruined our white pants of peace!
10172,MAN,Mr Fry rumour has it you know the secrets of the video game Chance. Please step into the war room.
10173,MAN,You'll be meeting with General Colin Pac-man.
10174,PAC-MAN,Wakka wakka wakka wakka. Lets get down to business. What can you tell us about the Nintendians?
10175,FRY,"Well sir, I spent all of ninth grade studying them. Except for that day when my eyeballs started to bleed. And in my opinion."
10176,PAC-MAN,"Quickly, to the escape tunnels!"
10177,PAC-MAN,This way damn it!
10178,ZOIDBERG,"Mmm, delicious! Just like stale marshmellows! Ooo and a cherry!"
10179,FRY,Hey watch out!
10180,ZOIDBERG,Uh oh!
10181,LEELA,"Oh my god, he ate Fry! Fry is dead!"
10182,FRY,"Its OK, I had another guy!"
10183,PAC-MAN,Wakka...wakka wa...
10184,LEELA,Invaders! Possibly from space!
10185,LRRR,"People of Earth, I am Lrrr of the planet Nintendu 64. Tremble in fear at our three different kinds of ships!"
10186,FRY,"Alright, its Saturday night. I have no date, a two litre bottle of Shasta, and my all Rush mix tape! Let's rock!"
10187,ND-ND,We're losing ships sir. What are your orders?
10188,LRRR,"Increase speed, drop down and reverse direction!"
10189,FRY,I've still got a trick or two up my sleeve. Watch as I fire up through our own shields.
10190,BENDER,He's a madman! A madman!!
10191,PAC-MAN,It's working. Victory is ensured! My retirement tomorrow will be all the sweeter!  I'm hit! So cold!
10192,MS PAC-MAN (CRYING),No - wakka wakka!
10193,FRY,"Amy, tend to the widow pac-man."
10194,LRRR,Drop down and increase speed.
10195,ZOIDBERG,One ship is left only.
10196,LEELA,Come on Fry get it!
10197,FRY [SWEATING],It's moving too fast. Oh I could never get the last one. My brother always got it for me!
10198,LRRR,"Drop down, reverse direction, prepare for landing."
10199,LRRR,You are defeated. Instead of shooting where I was you should have shot where I was going to be.
10200,BESERK,All your base are belong to us.
10201,FRY,What do you monsters want?
10202,DONKEY KONG,One thing and one thing only. Quarters! A million allowances worth of quarters! No slugs or tokens!
10203,BESERK,Fork 'em over! (different tone) Fork 'em over!
10204,FARNSWORTH,Forget it you pixelated pirates. We need those quarters to do our laundry.
10205,AMY,Yeah!
10206,BENDER,Right on!
10207,LEELA,Sure thing Professor!
10208,LRRR,"But, but space invaders need to do laundry too! I mean look at Donkey Kong here. Have you smelled his loincloth lately?"
10209,ZOIDBERG,Yes.
10210,AMY,Go away. We're not giving you our quarters no matter what.
10211,LRRR,Well...then what if we throw our laundry in with yours? Would that be acceptable?
10212,FRY,I guess so.
10213,LRRR,"OK then, that settles that. But if this cape shrinks, consider your species extinct!"
10214,NARRATOR,Bravo! That'll be hard to top! I pity the next Tale Of Interest!
10215,FARNSWORTH,"Well, there's time for one last question. Let's turn to the Who Ask machine to see who's next."
10216,WHO ASK MACHINE,Um uh um...Amy.  I mean Leela.
10217,LEELA,"OK, ahem. As an alien who was abandoned on Earth, I've never really belonged anywhere."
10218,BENDER,Boo hoo.
10219,FRY,Ow!
10220,BENDER,Uh...where?
10221,LEELA,So my question is this: What if I found my true home?  Ow!
10222,LEELA,Where are we?
10223,LEELA,"Nibbler, I don't think we're in New New York anymore.  Jeez, apparently the phrase tone it down doesn't exist on this planet.  Oh no! We hit someone! Quick, back into the ships.  Ooo, nice boots!"
10224,CUBERT,Look everyone! She killed the man-witch of the west!
10225,LEELA,A witch? That explains how these boots magically appeared on my feet.
10226,GLURMO,"No, you stole them, we saw you."
10227,LEELA,"Well...its hard to find shoes that fit me. So anyway, who are you people? Haven't I seen you in some copyrighted movie?"
10228,GLURMO (SINGING),"We resemble but are legally distinct from the lollipop guild, the lollipop -"
10229,AMY,"Greetings Leela, I'm The Cute With Of The North!"
10230,LEELA,"Yeah, can anyone fix my ship so I can get home?"
10231,AMY,Abracaduh! Just ask the Professor! He lives in the Emerald Laboratory down Martin Luther King Boulevard.
10232,LEELA,You mean that yellow brick road?
10233,AMY,The city council renamed it in 1975. (sarcastic) Ooo those are great shoes!
10234,LEELA,Oh thank you.
10235,AMY,Do they come in women's sizes?
10236,FRY,"OK crow, prepare to be scared.  And then - honk honk - the car honked it's own horn!"
10237,LEELA,"Wow, a talking scarecrow. Wanna come with us to see the Professor? He might be able to give you a brain."
10238,FRY,"Hey, that's not a nice thing to say."
10239,BENDER,Beer. Beer.
10240,LEELA,Whiskey OK?
10241,BENDER,Now did you say you were off to see the Professor? 'Cause I could use a heart. A human heart. I need to pump a lot of blood out of my basement.
10242,ZOIDBERG,And I'm the other guy. Courage. Not enough of it. Need some from whatshisname.
10243,MOM,Damn this DSL!  Fly my stupids! Fly out and get them!
10244,IGNER,"But Mom, you promised you'd make monkey cake today."
10245,MOM,"By ""monkey cake"" I meant your ass."
10246,FRY,"Man, we've been skipping for hours. I need to pull over and take the wiz."
10247,ZOIDBERG,What do I smell or something?  Oh!
10248,LEELA,Why did you bring us here?
10249,ZOIDBERG,And why did I have to take a cab?
10250,MOM,I'll tell you why I brought you here you twice baked barf bag. Because I've always wanted a daughter to love. You want to get adopted you little skank?
10251,LEELA,"And live here? And be a witch like you? Yeah, alright. As long as I get to hurt people and not just dance around at the equinox."
10252,MOM,Absolutely.
10253,LEELA,"Oh mommy, I found my true home!"
10254,BENDER,Hooray!
10255,ZOIDBERG,All right!
10256,FRY,That's great Leela.
10257,BENDER,I've heard worse excuses to drink. Oops.
10258,MOM,I'm melting! Who would have thought a small amount of liquid would ever fall on me?
10259,BENDER,"Well, no point in letting her go to waste."
10260,HERMES [FROM INSIDE],Yes?
10261,LEELA,We're here to see the Professor.
10262,HERMES [FROM INSIDE],No one sees the mighty Professor.
10263,LEELA,Oh for the love of Benji.
10264,FARNSWORTH,I am the Professor. Great and...uh...forgetful! Now what do you nice kids want?
10265,ZOIDBERG,"Nothing, I'm leaving. But if you have extra courage I'd haul it away for you maybe?"
10266,FARNSWORTH,"Oh blithery poop my cowardly lobster! You don't need courage. Afterall, who needs courage when you have a gun?"
10267,ZOIDBERG,"Now world, you put your hands up!"
10268,FARNSWORTH,"And you lad, all you need is brain."
10269,FRY,Why does everyone keep saying that?
10270,BENDER,This is a stick up. Give me the bag old man!
10271,FARNSWORTH,Here you go my friend. 5000 Professor Land fun bucks!
10272,BENDER,Oh crap.
10273,FARNSWORTH,"As for you young lady, you want to go home right?"
10274,LEELA,No not anymore. I wanna stay here and become the new Wicked Witch.
10275,FARNSWORTH,"Nonsense. Now click your big honking boots together three times and wish to go home to Kansas, to live in poerty with your dirt farming, teetotalling aunt and uncle."
10276,LEELA,"Uh, alright. Here I go.  There's no place like - I wanna be a witch!  Oh no, help, what's happening?"
10277,ZOIDBERG,"Uh sorry, I think there's a problem with your upstairs toilet."
10278,BENDER,Wake up!
10279,FRY,"Leela, are you alright? You got wanged on the head."
10280,LEELA,I was having the most wonderful dream. Except you were there and you were there and you were there.
10281,FRY,"Never mind Professor, she came to."
10282,FARNSWORTH,"Oh, so close."
10283,HERMES,"There's always next year Professor, there's always next year."
10284,THE END,
10285,"""LOVE AND ROCKET""",
10286,BENDER,You are one narrow minded spaceship Planet Express Ship.
10287,SHIP,Whoa whoa! Why should my tax money pay for art I find offensive?
10288,BENDER,Would you censor the Venus de Venus just because you can see her spewers?
10289,SHIP,Oh its filthy! Why not create a national endowment for strip clubs while we're at it?
10290,BENDER,Why not indeed!
10291,LEELA,Bender! Ship! Stop bickering or I'm going to come back there and change your opinions manually!
10292,BENDER,Fine! I'll be in my quarters appreciating controversial artworks.
10293,SHIP (SARCASTICALLY),Oops! Sorry!
10294,BENDER,Ah that ship is so white bread!
10295,HERMES,"People! It's Valentines Day next week, so your beloved company has gotten you all new uniforms!"
10296,AMY,Cool!
10297,ZOIDBERG,"Clothing, delicious clothing!"
10298,FARNSWORTH,We'll need to look our best if we're to get the account of our new potential customer Romanticorp!
10299,AMY,Romanticorp? Are they a corporation that makes romantic stuff?
10300,HERMES,Very good Amy!
10301,FARNSWORTH,Everyone suit up. We're off to the most romantic city on Earth!
10302,FARNSWORTH,"Remember, we've got to show these people we're not bitter husks of human beings who long ago abandoned hope of finding love in this lifetime. Leela you'll have to do some acting."
10303,LEELA,Check!
10304,SHELDON,"Welcome, aww I'm just so excited!  I'm Sheldon and this is my chief financial officer Gwen."
10305,GWEN,For 30 years we've shared the adventure of managing Romanticorp.
10306,SHELDON,Not to mention the adventure of marriage!
10307,LEELA,"Oh you have got to be kidding!  Ow! Ow! I mean, aww thats so sweet!  Ow! I mean, (soppily) Aww dats show shweet!"
10308,FARNSWORTH,"You know, romance is an important part of our work too, uh right everyone?"
10309,SHELDON,Do any of you collect Lovey Bears?
10310,AMY,I do! Kif's given me dozens! Is it true what the ad says? That you kiss them together out of blanket cloth and magic buttons?
10311,GWEN,No.
10312,SHELDON,It's actually cheaper to genetically engineer real ones.  They frolic in the Lovey Forest until their first birthday then we choose the cuddliest ugliest ones and stuff them full of fire retardant love fluff!
10313,AMY (UNSURE),Oh cute!
10314,GWEN,Knowing which pickup lines fizzle and which ones sizzle keeps us on the cutting edge of flirtation technology.
10315,FRAME #1,Is heaven missing an angel? 'Cause you've got nice cans!
10316,FRAME #2,My two favourite things are commitment and changing myself.
10317,LEELA,Does that dummy have a brother?
10318,SHELDON,And now friends and lovers we come to the heart of our operation. Pun definately intended!
10319,HERMES,Impressive!
10320,GWEN,My family has been making these hearts since the 1900's. Tastes may have changed but our secret recipe sure hasn't.
10321,FRY,"Whoa! Letters like ""U"" and ""R"" can mean words like ""You"" and ""Are."" Here Leela, U-R-2 Cute!"
10322,LEELA,Perhaps. What's your point?
10323,FRY,"I've never been able to put into words how I feel about you. But somewhere among these trillions of hearts, those words must already exist. And I'm gonna find them."
10324,FARNSWORTH,"So, do we have the contract?"
10325,FARNSWORTH,"With that big new Romanticorp contract, I've been able to make those government mandated upgrades you've all been suing me about."
10326,LEELA,Ooo look! You taped up the cracks in the dark matter reactor!
10327,FRY,And you got a cage for the lion!
10328,BENDER,Hey who's been messing with the radio? This isn't alternative rock. It's college rock!
10329,FARNSWORTH,Oh it must have been the ship's new improved personality software I installed.
10330,SHIP,Yeah it was me. It's a cute song.
10331,BENDER,Listen ship! No one changes my stations! I hope you have a good mechanic!
10332,FARNSWORTH,It even comes with an adjustable voice.
10333,SHIP,We each get one of the four buttons remember Bender? That was the deal.
10334,BENDER,Wha? Did you just say...?
10335,SHIP,If you don't like the stations you could just...play with my buttons 'til you find something we both enjoy.  Oh gosh! That came out all wrong!
10336,BENDER,"Too late baby, you said it! So what'll it be? My place? Or you?"
10337,FRY,"Before we deliver these hearts, I'm gonna find the one that sums up my feelings for you!  ""I Love You."" Hmm, too conventional. ""You're My Man."" Ooo so close!"
10338,LEELA,I'm not impressed by a guy's message Fry. I'm impressed by the guy. Or not.
10339,FRY,Whoa!
10340,LEELA,What was that?
10341,FRY,Maybe we hit a space cow.
10342,BENDER,Coochie coochie!
10343,SHIP (GIGGLING),Stop it! You're mussing up my trajectory!
10344,BENDER,You know you love it sugar-engine!
10345,SHIP (GIGGLING),No!
10346,LEELA,Bender!  What's going on in here?  Planet Express Ship! Cover your shame!
10347,SHIP,It's not what it looks like. Bender was just helping me...zip up my turbine.
10348,FRY,Wow Bender. Are you and the ship an item? I mean I know you're both items but...how can you date a ship anyway? It'd be like me dating a really fat lady. And living inside her. And she'd be all like...
10349,BENDER,"Fry, in order for me to get busy at maximum efficiency, I need a girl with a big 400 ton booty!"
10350,LEELA,"Bender, dating your co-worker and primary mode of transportation is immoral, illogical and a violation of interstellar shipping statute 437-B."
10351,BENDER,That's what makes it so nasty!
10352,LEELA,"Still, given the chance, I've given to urges far more shocking."
10353,BENDER (SINGING),"Daisy, Daisy, give me your answer do. I'm half crazy all for the love of you.  It won't be a stylish marriage......I can't afford a carriage.  But you'll look sweet upon the seat of a bicycle built for two."
10354,BENDER,"Well, I'm sick of her."
10355,FRY,The ship? But you just started dating.
10356,BENDER,With my mighty robot powers I can get sick of things much quicker than you humans.
10357,LEELA,Well just remember we all still have to work together. So try and let her down easy.
10358,BENDER,In due time Leela. But for now I'll just resume dating cheap floozies on the side.
10359,FRY,You have much to teach us.
10360,LEELA,Ugh. Doesn't it bother you even a little to be taking advantage of your girlfriend's trust?
10361,BENDER,Oh wait you're serious. Let me laugh even harder.
10362,FEMBOT #1,What's it like being a lawyer for the Mayor's office? And also the world's strongest millionaire?
10363,BENDER,"Well baby, for starters you gotta be honest all the time!"
10364,ELZAR,Good evening Bender! And to your lady friends may I say - Bam!
10365,FEMBOT #2,You know Elzar?
10366,FRY,Planet Express Ship? Is that you?
10367,SHIP,Oh. Hi Fry. Is Bender home?
10368,FRY,"Uh, um no. I think he's at his parent's."
10369,SHIP,Oh I see. He didn't fly there in another spaceship did he?
10370,FRY,Bender? No! He's an old fashioned one spaceship robot. Look I'll tell him you stopped by OK?
10371,SHIP,
10372,SHIP,Oh. Hi Fry. Is he home now?
10373,SHIP,"Of all the zoos we've been to today, I like this one the best. Bender, which is your favourite nocturnal rat?"
10374,BENDER,"Eh, they're all pretty unimpressive."
10375,SHIP,Oh honey look! The Tapirs!  It says here that the babies lose their pyjama like coat after their first year. Isn't that interesting honey?
10376,BENDER,Yup. Mind numbingly interesting. Ooh!
10377,SHIP,Bender!! Are you looking at other women?
10378,BENDER,No baby never!
10379,SHIP (CRYING),Bender! Don't lie! I saw you at Elzar's with those two ladys of the evening. Explain that!
10380,BENDER,"OK, I like a challenge.  Aah! I got it! I'm going to be completely honest with you Planet Express ship. Those women you saw me with...were my accountants!"
10381,SHIP,Your accountants? Oh I would dearly love to believe that were true. So I do.
10382,BENDER,Phew!
10383,SHIP,I'm going to go home and get dinner started.
10384,LIU,Who are you talking to?
10385,BENDER,No one baby! Lucy Liu is the only girl for Bender!
10386,LIU,I love you -
10387,LEELA,Planet Express Ship is something wrong?
10388,SHIP,Oh it's Bender. He's acting so strange lately.  Do you think he's going to ask me to marry him?
10389,LEELA,"Uh, no."
10390,SHIP,"Oh-oh, someone knows something she's not telling!"
10391,LEELA,"Uh look, I'm not saying Bender's not great but have you ever considered that maybe he's...y'know...not that great?"
10392,SHIP,You're just jealous! No one loves you because you're tiny and made of meat!
10393,LEELA,Could you maybe pay a little more attention to these asteroids?
10394,SHIP,Sorry Captain Leela. I guess I'm just having one of those...manic Mondays!
10395,LRRR,"This is ancient Earth's most foolish program. Why does Ross, the largest Friend, not simply eat the other five?"
10396,ND-ND,Perhaps they are saving that for sweeps.
10397,GUARD,"Exaulted leaders, the Earth messengers have arrived bearing a peace offering from their weak and fearful government."
10398,LRRR,Oh very well. This is a Joey heavy episode anyway.
10399,LRRR,I am Lrrr of the planet Omicron Persei 8.
10400,LEELA (READING),"Esteemed potentates of Omicron Persei 8, please accept these 20 billion candy hearts as proof that Earth loves you. Thiiis much!"
10401,LRRR,Bleurgh! These candies are choccy and unpleasant!
10402,ND-ND,"And what is this emotion you humans call ""wuv""?"
10403,LRRR,"Surely it says ""love""?"
10404,ND-ND,"No, ""wuv."" With an Earth ""w."" Behold!"
10405,LRRR (SHOUTING),This concept of wuv confuses and infuriates us!
10406,FRY,Incoming torpedoes. Shields at maximum yarnell.
10407,LEELA,"Steady, Planet Express Ship. Focus on diverting all power to the scramjets."
10408,BENDER,"Uh look, Planet Express Ship, this might not be the best time...but...well...I really like you and whatever but...I think we should just be friends."
10409,SHIP (SCREAMING),Nooo!
10410,BENDER,So we're cool?
10411,LEELA,"Well, it was a spectacular battle but there doesn't seem to be any permanent damage."
10412,SHIP (CRYING),No damage? What about my feelings?
10413,LEELA,"Aww, calm down. I'm sure Bender is taking this just as hard as you are."
10414,BENDER (SINGING),Bender is great oh Bender is great. Bender Bender Bender!
10415,FRY,You couldn't have picked a better time to dump the ship Bender!
10416,BENDER,"Eh, the moment seemed right. Call me old fashioned but I like a dump to be as memorable as it is devastating."
10417,LEELA,"I know, I know. Look Ship, if there's one thing I learnt from my mutual breakup with Sean that was totally mutual its that happiness can only come from within you."
10418,SHIP (CRYING),But Bender is within me! There must be some way to make him love me again.
10419,LEELA,Trust me. You can't change men anymore than you can change the laws of time and space.
10420,SHIP,"That's so true.  I may not be able to change the laws of time and space, but I know something that can."
10421,LEELA (UNSURE),Uh sweetie? You see that giant quasar we're heading into? You might wanna scooch a few parsecs to the left.
10422,SHIP,I'm afraid I can't do that Leela.
10423,FRY,What's happening? Space cow?
10424,LEELA,The ship's just taking the breakup a little hard. (whispering to Fry) She's nuts!
10425,SHIP,In a few moments the power of 10 million black holes will smush me and Bender together into a beautiful enternal quantum singularity.
10426,BENDER,Uh you don't need to kill us Planet Express ship...because...I love you! Uh yeah baby! I feel like doing stuff.
10427,SHIP,Hmm. I don't believe you. If you really wanted to be with me you'd merge your program with mine.
10428,BENDER,Whoa whoa whoa! Slow down! All of my friends that have done that said that afterwards all the passion went out of their relationship.
10429,LEELA,"Look, I don't know if you want my opinion -"
10430,SHIP,"Leela. Bender and I really need to be alone. So, I'm turning off the oxygen."
10431,LEELA,Now look missy! If you don't trun around now I'm going to have to shut down your brain!
10432,SHIP,Fire detected in the vicinity of Leela.
10433,FRY,Ha! That barely hurt Leela at all!
10434,SHIP,Maybe not. But what if the artificial gravity were to malfunction?
10435,BENDER,Float for your lives!
10436,LEELA,This is the one place she can't hear us. Everyone just pretend to shower.
10437,FRY,"Same as everyday, got it."
10438,LEELA,Now here's the plan.
10439,SHIP,"Oh, if only I could read lips!"
10440,LEELA,Comprendez Bender? You'll have to distract her. Merge your program with hers while I shut down her brain.
10441,BENDER,"It's too risky. I'm a very meek individual. If her personality engulfs mine, the Bender you know and worship could disappear forever!"
10442,LEELA,I'm willing to take that risk.
10443,BENDER,"Hey pookums! Contrary to what I was saying earlier, melding minds with you would be extremely bearable."
10444,SHIP,You really mean it?
10445,BENDER,Uh......yes!
10446,BENDER,Huh? Tubes? You're older than you said you were!
10447,SHIP,Come closer Bender. Lets become one!
10448,BENDER,I prefer two. That way we can still be a horse for Hallowe'en.
10449,LEELA,"OK, Bender has her distracted. Now I can shut down her brain by deactivating the carbonated logic matrix.  Ugh. I can't concentrate with this obnoxious candy in my face."
10450,FRY,I'm on it. And maybe I'll find those magic words while I'm at it.
10451,LEELA,Fat chance.
10452,FRY,Eh.  Blech!  Eurgh! Ooo how 'bout this one?
10453,LEELA,Give it up Fry! I've got to pop these tops in a precise order.
10454,LEELA,Halfway there. The ship should be getting a little less rational now.
10455,SHIP,Want...to...engulf...Bender!
10456,LEELA,Only a few more.  Hey! I won free admission to Six Flags! Just one more reason we must survive this.
10457,FRY,"Um, Leela?"
10458,LEELA,Fry! I'll read your candy later! When we're not dead!  What was that?
10459,FRY (SUFFOCATING),Oh nothing.
10460,SHIP,We're gonna love being each other you sexy ion!
10461,BENDER (SCREAMING),Nooo!
10462,LEELA,"Last one!  It worked! Gravity normal, air returning, terror replaced by cautious optimism! We did it Fry!  Fry?  You gave me your oxygen? Oh no! Breathe Fry breathe!  You leave me breathless! Happy Valentine's Day Fry!"
10463,FRY (GASPING),Happy Valentine's day.
10464,FRY,Bender! Are you OK?
10465,BENDER,Aw. What crazy thing am I going to date next?
10466,LEELA,Well at least it sounds like you were able to keep your conciousness seperate from hers.
10467,BENDER,Of course! Bender is a lone wolf. A solitary eagle.  A cuddly baby Tapir! And that's why I love 'em!
10468,FRY,Well I guess we'd better clean up these millions of hearts.
10469,LEELA,"Nah, I've got a lazier idea."
10470,THE END,
10471,"""LEELA'S HOMEWORLD""",
10472,FARNSWORTH,"Good news, everyone! You all know the orphanarium where Leela grew up?"
10473,FRY,Sure. We talk about it all the time.
10474,LEELA,Really?
10475,FRY,No. Burn!
10476,FARNSWORTH,"Well done, fellows! Anyway, said orphanarium has named Leela orphan of the year."
10477,AMY,Yee-ha!
10478,BENDER,All right!
10479,AMY,Your parents must be so proud. Oops! Sorry.
10480,FARNSWORTH,And the good news keeps on coming. Behold my latest invention.
10481,BENDER,Neat.
10482,FARNSWORTH,Ta-da! It's a glow-in-the-dark nose you can wear over your regular non-glowing nose. Observe.
10483,AMY,"Whoa, clool!"
10484,BENDER,Now I can punch you in the nose in the dark.
10485,BENDER,(snuffed) Where'd it go?
10486,AMY,"Hey, Professor what's all this scloop, glorking out of the machine?"
10487,FARNSWORTH,"That? It's uh...nothing. Yes, nothing. If you think it's anything you're a suspicous moron."
10488,HERMES,It looks like toxic waste.  And it smells like toxic waste.
10489,FRY,What does it taste like?
10490,HERMES,"Delicious fig pudding! Ooh, that's good! But a distinct aftertaste of toxic waste."
10491,FARNSWORTH,"Alright, alright so the machine produces a few toxic by-products! You don't have to make a federal case out of it."
10492,HERMES,"I'm afraid I do.  I order you dispose of that toxic waste properly, or bribe me. Either way it'll cost $500."
10493,BENDER,"500 real dollars? That's an outrage! Professor, I'll take care of that waste for $499 and 100 cents."
10494,FARNSWORTH,"Hmm, I know that's a rip but I'll pay for the convenience. Do you take credit cards?"
10495,BENDER,Let's find out.
10496,BENDER,"Alright, environment, you've met your match!"
10497,SMITTY,"Hey, get back in the sewer, weirdy. No mutants on the surface."
10498,VYOLET,But he ruined my wedding dress.
10499,BENDER,"Honey, that thing was ruined the minute it went on you. That's what I'm talkin' 'bout."
10500,VOGEL,"Y'know, it's not easy being an orphan, not if I have anything to do with it. But today's honouree, Turanga Leela, has really made something of herself . I'll never forget the night that cute little alien baby was abandoned on our doorstep. Because I have a photographic memory and I remember every night!"
10501,VOGEL,"What the...? An alien language? I guess you're an alien. What a beautiful gigantic eye you ha --  Well, come on in."
10502,VOGEL,"From those humble beginnings Leela went on to become a county-certified starship captain. And so it is my pleasure today, to nail her picture alongside those of our most distinguished alumini."
10503,LEELA,Thank you very much. Like many of you I never knew my parents...
10504,VOGEL,Give me a -- argh!
10505,LEELA,...I don't know if they were mighty alien overlords or simply underpaid alien janitors who fought crime on the side --
10506,VOGEL,Picture's up.
10507,BENDER,(shouting) It's crooked!
10508,LEELA,"...In the end though, it doesn't matter who my parents were. All that matters is what I learned here, within these unscalable walls, that I have strength to make it on my own, just like all of you kids here today."
10509,KIDS,(chanting) Leela! Leela! Leela!
10510,NINA,Look at me! I'm Leela!
10511,ALBERT,"Nuh uh, 'cause I'm double Leela!"
10512,VOGEL,"That's it, Albert, no more espresso for you."
10513,PHOTOGRAPHER,"Mind if I get a picture of you with your picture for the news, ma'am?"
10514,LEELA,Yes! I mean no! Just make sure you get my nonchalant side!
10515,GUY,Wooo!
10516,FRY,"If those aren't tears of happiness, please stop crying."
10517,LEELA,"(crying) It's OK, Fry, I'm fine. I won an award today."
10518,FRY,"Is it this room that's making you sad? It's probably the room. Come on, lets go for a walk."
10519,LEELA,"I'm sorry you saw that, Fry. I usually try to keep my sadness pent up inside where it can fester quietly as a mental illness."
10520,FRY,"Yeah, I do that with my stupidness."
10521,LEELA,"I told a whole crowd today that being an orphan made me strong. But all I really wanted was a mom and dad, to hold me and stroke my hair and tell me they loved me."
10522,FRY,"Then today's your lucky day because I happen to be a holding, stroking, lovin' machine! Also spankin'!"
10523,LEELA,That's not even close to what I had in mind.
10524,FRY,"Well, anyway, just remember that people care about you."
10525,LEELA,"I know.  Sometimes when I'm lonely, I look up at the sky and I get this feeling that somewhere, on some unknown planet, circling a distant star, my parents are up there, looking down on me."
10526,FRY,"Yo yo, Bezender! What up?"
10527,BENDER,My dumping business is booming. I just got hired to clean up the set of Free Willy 3.
10528,LEELA,"Bender! Cut it out! First of all the sewer mutants will be mad. Second, everything else that's horribly wrong with what you're doing!"
10529,BENDER,"Ah, those stupid mutants can't do anything. You seem to be forgetting one simple fact, namely, I'm up here and they are safely down --"
10530,BENDER,(shouting) What did I do to deserve this?
10531,DWAYNE,"Behold, our once beautiful mutigenic sewage lake."
10532,VYOLET,The radioactive waste you dumped in it has made it brighten up to see how ugly we really are.
10533,DWAYNE,"Oh, man!"
10534,RAOUL,As if our lives weren't miserable enough already!
10535,LEG MUTANT,Tell me about it!
10536,RAOUL,Let the punishment commence!
10537,LEELA,Punishment?
10538,FRY,No fair!
10539,BENDER,Bender's innocent!
10540,RAOUL,"The instant you touch these mutatious waters your DNA will be forever altered, turning you into horrible mutants like us. Especially him!  Allow me to demonstrate!"
10541,FRY,It's like that time I peeked in the kitchen at Imperial Hunan.
10542,RAOUL,Submerge the prisoners.
10543,BENDER,Wait. I don't even have DNA. Why am I screaming?
10544,DWAYNE,We're gonna beat you afterwards.
10545,MUTANTS,(chanting) Mutate! Mutate! Mutate! ...
10546,HOODED FIGURE #1,(shouting) Turanga Leela!
10547,LEELA,Who said that? How do you know my real name?
10548,BENDER,Whee!
10549,RAOUL,What are you doing? Stop it.
10550,FRY,What happened?
10551,LEELA,I don't know. I think I saved us somehow.
10552,RAOUL,(shouting) Go after them! The waters can't mutate us mutants!
10553,RAOUL,They went this way!
10554,BENDER,Quick! In there!
10555,DWAYNE,Kill! Kill! Kill!
10556,LEELA,Great chichi's ghost!
10557,BENDER,What's this junk?
10558,LEELA,It looks like...a timeline of my whole life.
10559,FRY,That's when we saved Earth from a giant asteroid of garbage.
10560,LEELA,And here's when I dropped out and bummed around India for a while.
10561,BENDER,And this is just last year at Space Mardi Gras.
10562,LEELA,Its like some kind of weird Leela museum...and I'm the Leela!
10563,FRY,(whispering) Dude! Over here!
10564,LEELA,It's all the best stuff I ever flushed down the toilet! Those are some of my diary pages. And my screenplay!
10565,FRY,And also - for some reason - the letter I wrote you full of my personal feelings.
10566,LEELA,"Oh, I'm scared!  My whole life has just been a show for some perverted mutant!"
10567,VYOLET,They must be in here.
10568,RAOUL,"Yeah, after them."
10569,BENDER,And then Bender ran!
10570,FRY,"Leela, freak out later. We're not done escaping yet!"
10571,DWAYNE,Got ya!
10572,LEG MUTANT,Take this!
10573,FRY,Ow!
10574,RAOUL,This time I'm calling for the death penalty. And not just because I'm running for re-election as Supreme Mutant.
10575,MUTANTS,(chanting) Four more years! Four more years!
10576,RAOUL,"Oh, very well.  Your attention. Instead of being tortured to death, the prisoners shall hereby be expelled from the sewers and never allowed to return."
10577,BENDER,(sarcastic) Oh cruel fate! Can we really never return to this dank pit of sewage?!
10578,LEELA,Wait a minute. Why aren't you gonna kill us anymore?
10579,BENDER,Yeah! What are you chicken? Buk buk buk bukuk!
10580,FRY,"(whispering) Shut up, you two! We can kill ourselves when we get home!"
10581,RAOUL,They'll need transportation to the surface. Bring in the airship.
10582,BENDER,Eww!
10583,RAOUL,"We constructed it from the remnants of old discarded Macy's parade balloons: Underdog's groin, Bart Simpsons's left ear and right shin, Garfield's owner Jon's forehead."
10584,MUTANT,Fire up the sewer gas!
10585,TRICLOPS,Move it ya ugly normals!
10586,BENDER,"Uh, I'm gettin' dizzy! I can't walk straight!"
10587,FRY,Come on Leela. You can do it!
10588,BENDER,Hurry! We're missing our bus!
10589,FRY,Whoa! What are you doing?
10590,BENDER,I'm gettin' on the bus!
10591,LEELA,(shouting) Don't worry! I'll be fine! (talking) They know something about me and I've got to find out what.  The lake didn't mutate me. What is going on here?!
10592,OCTOPUS,It worked for me. I used to be a little blonde girl named Virginia.
10593,LEELA,Eurgh!  Who the hell are you?
10594,HOODED FIGURE #1,No one. And watch your language young lady!
10595,TRICLOPS,Stop right there! I don't want to hurt you.  I didn't want you to hurt me either.
10596,FRY,Leela's going nuts and I can't save her unless I learn more about her mysterious past. Isn't there anything else you can tell me?
10597,VOGEL,Nah. Nothing that wouldn't be a waste of your time.
10598,FRY,That's impossible because my time is worthless!
10599,VOGEL,"Huh. Well then there is one thing. It's the note I found with Leela the day she was abandoned. But it's written in Alienese, so no-one on Earth can translate it. Not even Brainzilla."
10600,FRY,Hand it over.
10601,VOGEL,Sure.  I just wish I could be more helpful. Would you like some dirt on any other orphans?
10602,FRY,"Look, I'm trying to save someone here. I'll have to come back for those later."
10603,FRY,Can you translate it?
10604,FARNSWORTH,"Of course. But only into Beta Crypt 3, a language so complex, there's even less chance of understanding it."
10605,FRY,I didn't ask for a completely reasonable excuse. I asked you to get busy.
10606,FARNSWORTH,Very well.
10607,FRY,Isn't that the same machine that makes noses?
10608,FARNSWORTH,"It can do other things. Why shouldn't it?  Of course, even if it is possible to analyse the message there's no way of knowing how long it would take. It could take an hour or it could take a hundred million years."
10609,FRY,Is it done?
10610,FARNSWORTH,Certainly not. Two dings means it's done.  But not like that. Slightly more rapid.
10611,LEELA,Where did they go?
10612,BENDER,"Good news, Leela. I landed the contract to empty all the spitoons in Little Italy."
10613,LEELA,Ew!
10614,FARNSWORTH,"That's it, it's done!  I can't believe it! My mind is boggling. The analysis of the note is printing out now."
10615,DOCTOR,It's a girl.
10616,MOTHER,My God! She's beautiful. No extra anythings.
10617,FATHER,What people skills.
10618,MOTHER,She's completely perfect!
10619,DOCTOR,"In my professional opinion as an ear, ear, ear, nose and throat doctor, she is the least-mutated mutant ever born."
10620,FATHER,And yet she's cursed to live the horrible degrading life of a mutant. Like all of us. Especially him!
10621,LEG MUTANT,It's true!
10622,MOTHER,Maybe we can do better for her.
10623,FATHER,"I made this bracelet so that in some small way, we'll always be with you, even when it doesn't seem like it. During your entire life, for example."
10624,MOTHER,"You won't pass for human, cutie. But if my PhD in exo-liguistics is worth diddly-poop, this note should convince them you're an alien.  And that'll be enough to give you a real life."
10625,FATHER,She'll never know we're her parents.
10626,MOTHER,That's our gift to her. Better we should die than have her learn the shameful truth of her origin.
10627,FATHER,I'm with you.
10628,VOGEL,What a beautiful gigantic eye you ha -- . Well come on in.
10629,HOODED FIGURE #1,Keep quiet so she doesn't hear us.
10630,HOODED FIGURE #2,What's there to talk about?
10631,HOODED FIGURE #1,Shhh!
10632,LEELA,Hands up!  Tentacles too!
10633,HOODED FIGURE #1,"Don't say anything stupid, Morris."
10634,LEELA,What is all this?  Am I a game to you? Or some kind of even more boring Truman Show? Do you belive I'm you Messiah? Your Mutant Dali Lama? Stop me if I guess it!
10635,HOODED FIGURE #2,Well actually there --
10636,HOODED FIGURE #1,Morris! Shh!
10637,LEELA,"(angry) And what about this?!  How did you get this bracelet? Did you steal it from me when I was a baby? Or from my parents. You robbed my parents, didn't you? I bet you sick mutants killed them. My parents were confused aliens lost on Earth and you killed them! Is that it? Admit it!"
10638,HOODED FIGURE #2,(sombre) Yes. We killed them.
10639,HOODED FIGURE #1,You guessed the truth.
10640,LEELA,Because of you I'll never know my parents. I'll kill you!
10641,HOODED FIGURE #1,That would be best.
10642,FRY,Stop!  Thanks Bender! Don't do it Leela!
10643,LEELA,They killed my parents!
10644,FRY,Close.
10645,LEELA,They are my parents.
10646,MUNDA,Yes.
10647,FRY,I had the Professor analyse the alienese letter that was found with you.
10648,LEELA,What does it say?
10649,FRY,I 'unno. But the analysis showed it was printed on recycled toilet paper. A squeezably soft paper used mainly in the sewers.
10650,MUNDA,"It says, ""Your parents love you very much""."
10651,MORRIS,We still do.
10652,LEELA,"So, I'm not an alien? I'm a mutant."
10653,MORRIS,We never wanted you to know. You deserved a better life.
10654,MUNDA,You must despise us.
10655,LEELA,(crying) You're my parents. All I've ever wanted is to know you.  This is the happiest moment of my life.
10656,BENDER,Aww!
10657,THE END,
10658,"""WHERE THE BUGGALO ROAM""",
10659,MR. WONG,(from inside) Yes?
10660,AMY,"Hi, Dad. It's me and my co-workers."
10661,MRS. WONG,"(from inside) Open up, Leo. It's Amy and her weirdos."
10662,MRS. WONG,"Howdy, friends! Welcome to Mars!"
10663,LEELA,"Thanks so much for inviting us, Mr. Wong. I've never been to a Mars Day barbecue."
10664,MR. WONG,"Oh, Mars Day much better than Earth Day. Dump trash wherever you want! Big, empty planet!"
10665,MRS. WONG,"OK, then. Make yourselves at home."
10666,ZOIDBERG,"Don't mind if I already did. By the way, do you have anymore of this Dom Perignon bubble bath? There was only enough to fill the tub halfway."
10667,FARNSWORTH,This is quite a large ranch you have.
10668,MR. WONG,17.9 billion acres. We own entire western hemisphere. (whispering) That the best hemisphere!
10669,FARNSWORTH,It's the same on Earth.
10670,MR. WONG,"Here is most number one product of all: The mighty buggalo. They used for everything; Meat, milk and their shells make good row boat."
10671,ZOIDBERG,(shouting) I broke your television.
10672,HERMES,"Mon, it must take forever to brand all those cattle."
10673,MR. WONG,"Not really. We own so much stuff, it easier just to brand everything that not ours."
10674,HERMES,Please don't do that.
10675,AMY,"Betsy!  This is my sweet, little Betsy. I raised her from a larva that ate one of my sweaters."
10676,MR. WONG,"Yes, everybody love Betsy. We going to eat her at Amy's wedding. If she ever get married!"
10677,AMY,Dad! Gleesh! Please don't say things like that when you meet my boyfriend tonight.
10678,MR. WONG,"Oh, that right. We finally get to spend some time with this Mr. Kif."
10679,MRS. WONG,I just hope he's a nice man who can make us lot of grandchildren. This not some parallel universe where you getting any younger.
10680,ZAPP,"Now, remember, Kif: The quickest way to a girl's bed is through her parents. Have sex with them and you're in."
10681,KIF,"Actually, sir, I'm, I'm a little nervous about meeting her family."
10682,ZAPP,"Well that's natural. After all you're meek and uninteresting. Until now you've gotten by on my left-over charisma, scrounging off it like a tiny charisma parasite."
10683,KIF,I just hope they like me.
10684,ZAPP,"And why wouldn't they? Yes, yes, I know. Tiny, meek, uninteresting. Spare me your tedious life story, Kif. And above all have fun!"
10685,BENDER,"Yeah, yeah, get on down!  Oh, yeah! Drop another barnyard bomb on us, Vanilla Corn!"
10686,DJ,"Yo, fool! It's Mixmaster Festus!"
10687,FRY,"So what's Mars Day about, anyway?"
10688,MRS. WONG,"It commemorate the day centuries ago when our ancestor, Sir Reginald Wong, bought Mars from stupid natives."
10689,LEELA,"How can you call the Native Martians ""stupid""?"
10690,MR. WONG,They sell whole planet for one bead. Sound stupid to me!
10691,FARNSWORTH,That is stupid!
10692,LEELA,"I can't believe you're laughing at the tragic exploitation of a proud, bead-loving people."
10693,FRY,"Lighten up, Leela. It's funny!"
10694,LEELA,Of course it is. But you don't have to laugh!
10695,KIF,"Amy, no! Not on your parents' planet!"
10696,RJ,"Howdy, Amy. Glad to see you've come back to the country. It's where the flavour is."
10697,AMY,"RJ, this is my boyfriend, Kif."
10698,RJ,"This wimp? You've gone a long way, baby. Cigarette, partner?"
10699,KIF,"Oh, I don't--"
10700,RJ,I haven't even lit it yet!
10701,KIF,Oh. Is it lit now?
10702,RJ,Yep.  You're pathetic!
10703,ZOIDBERG,Host-man! Host-woman! I'm having a wonderful time!
10704,MR. WONG,"You here five hours and already you tear up couch, draw moustache on priceless painting and fill pool with brine shrimp."
10705,ZOIDBERG,"Not bad for a city boy, huh?  By the way, I took the liberty of fertilising your caviar."
10706,AMY,Just relax. I'm sure my parents will love you.
10707,KIF,"You don't understand. When I get nervous, I can't control my camouflage reflex. Oh, dear!  Oh, goodness! Oh, odds and bodkins!"
10708,FRY,I'll have a thorax and some feelers.
10709,MR. WONG,You want some salad with that?
10710,FRY,Yuck!
10711,AMY,Mom? Dad? You remember Kif?
10712,MR. WONG,This your boyfriend? I have instant dislike of him!
10713,MRS. WONG,He too scrawny to father grandchildren.
10714,AMY,"He's not scrawny, he's just small-boned."
10715,KIF,"Actually, I don't have bones. I'm supported by a system of fluid-filled bladders that--"
10716,MR. WONG,"Yes, yes! You a big squishy wuss! Amy should be dating real man. Like him!"
10717,KIF,"I can be manly too. I think I'll, uh, light up a smoke."
10718,AMY,(whispering) Wrong way!
10719,KIF,(wheezy) Smooth!
10720,AMY,Look on the bright side: My parents left after you passed out so they didn't even see you barf.
10721,KIF,"Oh, now they'll never think I'm manly enough to date their daughter."
10722,AMY,"It's OK, Kif.  I'll go get you a tissue from your tote."
10723,RJ,"Hey there, Amy. Like you to meet my buddy, Joe."
10724,JOE,Sorry I'm late. My pool game ran long at the jazz club!
10725,RJ,Kids love him!
10726,FRY,What's that weird sound?
10727,MR. WONG,"Dust storm! Oh, dust storm! Everybody into house. Hurry, before we die. And wipe your damn feet!"
10728,MRS. WONG,Phew! Everyone OK? No-one considering lawsuit?
10729,FARNSWORTH,Hmm. I might have mental anguish.
10730,MR. WONG,I'll have you know I'm friends with every judge on planet.
10731,FARNSWORTH,I'm OK then.
10732,MRS. WONG,"Storm dying down. Leo, check if buggalo herd is OK."
10733,MR. WONG,Oh!
10734,LEELA,What happened to the buggalo?
10735,MR. WONG,They been rustled under cover of storm. We ruined!
10736,ZOIDBERG,(screaming) Nooo!
10737,AMY,"Don't worry, Daddy. It'll be OK."
10738,MR. WONG,"Oh, really? Who gonna save us?  One-eye? Lobster mooch?  Drunken garbage can?"
10739,HERMES,This sounds like a job for--
10740,KIF,Lieutenant Kif Kroker!
10741,HERMES,Alright then.
10742,MR. WONG,"Aye-ah! Those buggalo are what made Wong family so rich and powerful. Oh, Inez, with them stolen, we ruined!"
10743,MRS. WONG,OK. I want a divorce.
10744,ZOIDBERG,Mom! Dad! Don't ask me to choose!
10745,AMY,"They're not your parents, I'm not your sister and that's not your golf cart."
10746,ZOIDBERG,Aw!
10747,AMY,Everybody just calm down. Kif promised he'd catch the rustlers.
10748,KIF,"Mrs. Wong, do you have a neckerchief I could borrow?"
10749,KIF,"My plan is to take all the remaining buggalo and lead them on a rough, tough cattle drive. Then, when the rustlers attack, I'll make a citizen's arrest!"
10750,FARNSWORTH,"It sounds dangerous. Someone could get killed. Fry, Leela, Bender, I want you to go with him."
10751,FRY,"Aw, man!"
10752,KIF,"Don't worry, Mr. and Mrs. Wong. I'll get your cattle back or die trying."
10753,MR. WONG,"Hey, we can't lose!"
10754,AMY,"No, Kif! It's too risky. You don't have to do this to prove your manliness."
10755,MRS. WONG,"Oh, yes he does!"
10756,RJ,Here are your mounts!
10757,LEELA,She's got a fine coat.
10758,KIF,"Now, we need buggalo to lure the rustlers. How many are left?"
10759,AMY,"You're lookin' at her. Betsy's the only one left. She was curled up in my hamper when the storm hit.  Aw, she likes you!"
10760,KIF,"Saddle up, men. We got some no good rustlers to ... catch!"
10761,BENDER (SINGING),"We've got a right to pick a little fight with rustlers,"
10762,FRY,Yee-haw!
10763,LEELA,"Wow, look at that: Olympus Mons. The tallest volcano in the solar system."
10764,FRY,Where?
10765,LEELA,Right in front of you.
10766,FRY,Oh. Oh!
10767,KIF,We'll camp near the top. The rustlers will be sure to spot us there.
10768,FRY,Where?
10769,BENDER,"And even thought the computer was off and unplugged, an image stayed on the screen. It was ... the Windows logo!"
10770,FRY,"Pfft, that's not scary!"
10771,BENDER,It is if you're a laser printer.
10772,LEELA,"OK, my turn to tell a ghost story. Once, there was this woman driving--"
10773,FRY,Hook on the hand!
10774,KIF,"OK, I've got one. This family--"
10775,FRY,Man in the attic!
10776,LEELA,"Fine, Mr. Know-It-All-About-Something-Finally, you tell a story!"
10777,FRY,"With pleasure. (spookily) Once, not far from here, four people set out on a cattle drive--"
10778,BENDER,"(speaking fast) Robot gets bored and kills Fry with a hammer! (normal) Sorry, go on."
10779,FRY,"And then, while they sat helplessly around the campfire ... a demented knife-wielding escaped lunatic libertarian zombie mutant snuck up and--"
10780,AMY,(from bushes) Surprise!
10781,KIF,Amy? What are you doing here?
10782,AMY,I forgot to give you something before you left.
10783,KIF,What?
10784,AMY,Is that your camouflage reflex or are you just happy to see me?
10785,KIF,"I love it out here, Amy. I feel so manly. I have a blister, I-I spit! A-And of course, I tell no one my feelings."
10786,AMY,"But you still have them, right?"
10787,KIF,"Oh, yes. But I keep them inside until I can write them in my diary."
10788,AMY,"Ah, it's a wonderful night."
10789,KIF,It sure is. I could just lie here beside you staring at the sky all night.
10790,AMY,I can't!  What's that?
10791,KIF,Maybe we just made love.
10792,AMY,The buggalo! They're in the crater.
10793,KIF,"The rustlers must have seen me coming and run off, scared."
10794,AMY,"Oh, Kif! You're so brave!"
10795,KIF,(nervous) Sh! They'll hear us!
10796,KIF,"OK, the dynamite's in place."
10797,AMY,Are you sure there's no other way to get the buggalo out?
10798,LEELA,Not unless your parents have thousands of helicopters at their disposal.
10799,AMY,Well actually--
10800,BENDER,Too late! This is more fun!
10801,AMY,Kif! You did it! But how did you know the dynamite would work?
10802,KIF,I once took a seminar in ejecting chickens from a sand dune. The principle is essentially the same.
10803,FRY,"Hey, it's that ""barbecue's over"" sound again."
10804,LEELA,(shouting) Sandstorm!  We're in the eye of the storm!
10805,FRY,Where?
10806,BENDER,What's that?
10807,FRY,My God!
10808,LEELA,Who are they?
10809,SINGING WIND,Fehk! We are the Native Martians.
10810,FRY,"Also, I didn't know buggalo could fly."
10811,SINGING WIND,Only those who revere Mother Mars can fly buggalo. And only they shall have buggalo. And they're us.
10812,KIF,"But your, um, Martian-ness, these buggalo aren't yours. They belong to the Wong family."
10813,SINGING WIND,You mean family that took all Martian land and gave us one lousy bead?
10814,AMY,Uh-huh! Amy Wong.  And you are?
10815,SINGING WIND,Mad at Wong family! We plan to ruin them by stealing buggalo. But now we take girl instead.
10816,AMY,Wait! I'm too rich to be kidnapped!
10817,KIF,Amy! Nooo!
10818,BENDER,"Don't worry, Kif. I'm sure some other beautiful, rich girl will fall in love with you."
10819,MR. WONG,Hooray! You bring back cattle.
10820,KIF,Yes ... but ... I'm afraid I've got some bad news as well.
10821,MRS. WONG,Let Amy tell us. That way it soften the blow.  Why Amy being so quiet?
10822,KIF,"Um ... well, um ... that is, um..."
10823,MR. WONG,"Oh, no! Martians kidnap Amy!  I know it them 'cause they no use good grammar."
10824,KIF,"I'll get your daughter back, sir. I swear."
10825,MR. WONG,"Forget it, squishy. You the one lose her in first place. You done enough."
10826,MRS. WONG,Yeah. This time we get most decorated law man in the whole universe!
10827,KIF,"You mean--? Oh, no, please. I beg you! Oh, for the love of--"
10828,ZAPP,"I am the man with no name. Zapp Brannigan, at your service!"
10829,MRS. WONG,"Please, Mr. Brannigan, we need you go get our daughter back."
10830,ZAPP,Very well. I'll clean up Kif's mess. I shall go bargain with the Martian's personally.  Your gasps intrigue me. Explain.
10831,MR. WONG,Martians have no land. They been gently encouraged to live on reservation deep underground. No-one ever dare go there.
10832,FARNSWORTH,"This mission is incredibly dangerous. Someone's sure to be killed. Fry, Leela, Bender--"
10833,BENDER,"Damn you, old man!"
10834,LEELA,"Aw, look. Betsy followed you, Kif!"
10835,ZAPP,"I didn't realise you were bringing your girlfriend, lieutenant!"
10836,KIF,She won't leave me alone.
10837,ZAPP,"Did I say ""girlfriend""? She sounds more like a wife!"
10838,ZAPP,Behold: The Great Stone Face of Mars.
10839,FRY,Hm.
10840,ZAPP,The only known entrance to the Martian reservation.
10841,LEELA,What about the Great Stone Ass of Mars?
10842,ZAPP,"Well, yeah, but it's way over the other side of the planet."
10843,ZAPP,"Nose-ward, ho!"
10844,SINGING WIND,"Fehk! I am Singing Wind, chief of the Martian tribe."
10845,ZAPP,Take me to your leader.
10846,SINGING WIND,Moving along. Why you trespass on our land?
10847,ZAPP,We come to negotiate the release of Amy Wong. And just to clarify: Land is the stuff that has sky over it.
10848,LEELA,They have such respect for the planet.
10849,MARTIAN,Cynthia used to drink Slurm.
10850,SINGING WIND,We will give back girl when we get back planet surface.
10851,ZAPP,How do we even know she's alive?
10852,AMY,I'm fine.
10853,ZAPP,Sh! You're weakening our bargaining position. How about instead you give us the girl and we carve a bunch of our presidents into your sacred mountain?
10854,SINGING WIND,You waste words. We want return of land that was taken from us.
10855,BENDER,"Uh, actually you traded it for a bead."
10856,SINGING WIND,Tribe suffer heap big buyer's remorse. We want land back!
10857,ZAPP,"Chief, my people are a people of law. And that law is ...  ... no backsies!"
10858,SINGING WIND,The time for stupid statements is over!
10859,ZAPP,"Oh, boy!"
10860,LEELA,"Ow, ow, ow, ow! My eye!"
10861,ZOIDBERG,Ma! Pa! Our precious ranch!
10862,KIF,"Amy, no! It's too windy!  Stay calm, dearest! I'll save you!"
10863,AMY,Kif!  You're flying Betsy!
10864,KIF,Need a lift?
10865,SINGING WIND,Great Mother Mars! He has the gift!
10866,LEELA,"Yay, Kif!"
10867,ZAPP,"Kroker, that was one Brannigan-esque feat of heroism!"
10868,SINGING WIND,"We have misjudged you, green one. You fly the buggalo like us. You have true reverence for Mother Mars. Let there be peace between us."
10869,MARTIAN #2,Yes. Let us smoke on peace pipe.
10870,KIF,Smoke-em?
10871,SINGING WIND,"Here, take."
10872,KIF,"Ooh, no thanks. I'm on the peace patch."
10873,SINGING WIND,You must smoke peace pipe. And you must do it peacefully. Or we'll kill you.
10874,KIF,Well it's just really that I don't feel that--
10875,ZAPP,"Don't be such a chicken, Kif. Teenagers all smoke and they seem pretty on the ball."
10876,FRY,Yeah!
10877,ZAPP,"Yes, sir!"
10878,BENDER,Way to suck it!
10879,KIF,"Hey, I'm smoking! I'm the greatest! Oh, monkey trumpets!"
10880,SINGING WIND,You have coughed at our offer of peace. So you must die!
10881,MARTIAN #2,The very bead used to crush our dreams shall be used to crush your bones.
10882,KIF,"Well, actually, I don't have bones. I'm supported by a system of fluid-filled bladders that--"
10883,FRY,Wait. That's the bead you traded your land for?
10884,LEELA,It's a gigantic diamond! That thing must be worth a fortune.
10885,SINGING WIND,Really?
10886,BENDER,"Oh, Chief, you've made me the happiest girl in the world!"
10887,AMY,"Y'know, if you still want your land, we could just trade back for it."
10888,SINGING WIND,Hmm. We always thought bead was worthless. We assumed our ancestors were cheated because they not have concept of ownership.
10889,BENDER,So we can have the diamond?
10890,SINGING WIND,No. We do have concept of ownership. You are free to go. Sorry about all the rustling and kidnapping.
10891,LEELA,But what about your sacred land?
10892,SINGING WIND,"Land shmand! We don't wanna live on this planet. It's a dump. We'll buy new planet and act like it's sacred. With cash like this, who's going to argue? Nobody, that's who!"
10893,AMY,"Then Kif flew Betsy, rescued me from the tornado and made peace with the Martians."
10894,MR. WONG,Please! He too much of a wimp.
10895,MRS. WONG,Yeah. I'm sure it was all Mr. Zapp Brannigan here.
10896,ZAPP,"Please, you give me too little credit."
10897,ZOIDBERG,"Captain Brannigan, you're always welcome here at Rancho Zoidberg!"
10898,ZOIDBERG,"Money doesn't make good people, no siree!"
10899,AMY,"Thanks for saving my life, Kif. You're my hero."
10900,KIF,"Oh, you're kind. But your parents still don't like me."
10901,AMY,Well globviously! But if they liked you then I wouldn't. Don't you know anything about girls?
10902,KIF,"Dear diary, I just made love for the second time!"
10903,THE END,
10904,"""A PHARAOH TO REMEMBER""",
10905,LINDA [ON TV],"Up next, daring daylight robbery at a municipal swimming pool."
10906,BENDER,Ooo! This is it! Turn me up!
10907,LINDA [ON TV],"Earlier today a foul mouthed bandit robbed the municipal pool, making off with the contents of over three lockers."
10908,BENDER,More like three lockers and a sink!
10909,LEELA,Bender? Did you have something to do with this?
10910,HERMES,Holy spitz! He's sportin' skintight speedos!
10911,AMY,They don't leave much to the imagination.
10912,HERMES,Actually on a robot they sorta do.
10913,MORBO [ON TV],One puny human got a look at the robber...
10914,BENDER,Here we go here we go!
10915,MORBO [ON TV],"...describing him as a short, nasty, muscular..."
10916,BENDER,Yeah make me famous big head!
10917,MORBO [ON TV],...Caucasian human male.
10918,BENDER,What?
10919,FRY,Hey! Now what am I supposed to watch and drink all day?
10920,BENDER,"This is an outrage. What's the point of pulling the biggest pool caper ever, if nobody knows you did it?"
10921,FRY,Well there's the material rewards.
10922,BENDER,You mean this junk?
10923,BOY,Wheeee!
10924,BENDER,(crying) All I ever wanted was for people to remember my name... (hoarse) it's Bender.
10925,FARNSWORTH,Oh fuff! What's the point in remembering something? You're just going to forget it five seconds later.
10926,BENDER,"(crying) It's so unfair. A debonair robot with a zesty in-your-face outlook doomed to obscurity like the rest of you especially Leela! If I died tomorrow, no one would even notice."
10927,SCRUFFY,"Boy, I've never seen him so down - or ever before."
10928,BENDER,How does a nobody like me get famous? I know!  Hey look! I'm stuck! But I haven't given up hope! Call a soft news journalist!
10929,WOMAN,You're not stuck.
10930,BENDER,(sadly) Shut up.
10931,BENDER,Hey everyone do The Bender! This move's called The Bender!
10932,ROLLER-SKATER,"Yo hotwheels, this circle's about free expression, not fascist moves!"
10933,BENDER,A blank wall! Fame is mine!
10934,BENDER,"There, now no one will forget how I lived or my attitude regarding butt."
10935,SAL,Alrights ladies let's flush these artists lofts straights to hell!
10936,BENDER,(screaming) Nooo!
10937,BENDER,I'm the first one to work. A new low.
10938,ALL,Surprise!
10939,FRY,Happy funeral Bender!
10940,BENDER,A surprise funeral? For me?
10941,FRY,We just wanted to show you that you really will be remembered.
10942,BENDER,Ooo! Cushiony! And a minibar!
10943,FRY,"Dearly beloved, we are here today to remember Bender, taken from us in the prime of life, when he was crushed by a runaway semi, driven by the Incredible Hulk."
10944,BENDER,"Aww, you knew my favourite cause of death!"
10945,FRY,Now let us each remember the best things about Bender in our own way. Professor?
10946,FARNSWORTH,Your standard Bending Unit is made of an iron-osmium alloy. But Bender was different. Bender has a point-04% nickel impurity.
10947,BENDER,(crying) It's what made me me.
10948,HERMES,"If you ever needed a small package brought inot the country without a lot of X-raying and such, Bender always had a free body cavity."
10949,BENDER,"Eh, the Professor's was better."
10950,LEELA,Bender shush. You're supposed to be dead.
10951,BENDER,Say more about how great I am. And where's the crying? You people look like you're waiting for the bus.
10952,ZOIDBERG,"(singing) Oh Danny-boy! The pipes, the pipes are calling...!"
10953,BENDER,Who-y-boy?
10954,ZOIDBERG,(singing) ...From glen to glen and down -
10955,BENDER,"Danny-boy? You're at my funeral, singing about some dead stiff named Danny-boy? You really are a massive bonehead."
10956,ZOIDBERG,I'm expressing my sorrow.
10957,BENDER,"Get lost. I'd say ""Don't quit your day job!"" but you're awful at that too."
10958,LEELA,We're trying our best.
10959,BENDER,Your best is an idiot. Let's pick it up people. So far it's been crap after crap! I croaked now show me some love!
10960,AMY,Bender was a truly special -
10961,BENDER,Louder and sadder.
10962,AMY,(shouting) Bender was a truly special -
10963,BENDER,Next!
10964,PREACHERBOT,Dear Lord -
10965,BENDER,Oh next!
10966,ZOIDBERG,(singing) Oh Danny-boy!
10967,BENDER,"Come on, surely there must be someone here who knows how great I was."
10968,FRY,"Yes there is Bender. Bender was a lot of things to a lot of people, but looking back, the number one thing I can say about him is this, and simply this: Bender was my friend."
10969,BENDER,What? That's it? Who are you? You're nobody! This is the worst funeral ever! I hope you're all happy. You've succeeded in convincing me life is worth living - by showing how bad my funeral will suck.
10970,AMY,I know who's funeral we'll be attending next!
10971,FARNSWORTH,(bashful) Oh stop!
10972,FARNSWORTH,News everyone! Today you're going to Osiris 4 to deliver this enourmous sandstone block.
10973,FRY,I thought something looked different in here.
10974,FRY,"Hi, we have a giant stone to deliver - sign here."
10975,OSIRAN,"Ah, very nice. Much like the 10 million other identical stones used in the future tomb of our great Pharaoh Hermenthotip."
10976,LEELA,"Impressive, who's building it?"
10977,OSIRAN,You.
10978,LEELA,Say again?
10979,OSIRAN,You are now slaves of the great Pharaoh Hermenthotip. Guards.
10980,FRY,"Call it a hunch but, I've got a bad feeling about this."
10981,FRY,You know the worst thing about being a slave? They make you work but they don't pay you or let you go.
10982,LEELA,That's the only thing about being a slave!
10983,OSIRAN,"Attention. You are now possessions of the great Pharaoh Hermethotip, heir to the 10th dynasty, bringer of the good aspects of the annual floods."
10984,FRY,Incredible. This place is just like the Ancient Egypt of my day.
10985,OSIRAN,That is no coincidence. For our people visited your Egypt thousands of years ago.
10986,FRY,I knew it! Insane theories: one! Regular theories: a billion!
10987,OSIRAN,"We learned many things from the mighty Egyptians, such as pyramid building, space travel and how to prepare our dead so as to scare Abbott and Costello."
10988,FRY,Also Wolfman!
10989,BENDER,Look at these swanky tombs! These people really know how to die!
10990,LEELA,Are you crazy? They worked thousands of people to death to make these stupid monuments.
10991,BENDER,"Hey, you spend you're whole life building a guy's toe and you're gonna remember him!  I think I'm gonna like it here!"
10992,MAN #1,"Yeah, I uh, noticed your sign and I thought I'd come over here and look into getting involved in your program."
10993,MAN #2,What we do is make you starve to death.
10994,OSIRAN,One two three - pull!  One two three - pull!
10995,AUSTRALIAN GUY,"Aw, bloody chunder!"
10996,BENDER,"Pick it up people, we're enslaved here to do a job. Master? Do we have to count to three every time? Couldn't we just count to one. Or better yet one half?"
10997,OSIRAN,Good idea slave.  One half - pull! One half - pull!
10998,BENDER,Now we're slavin'!
10999,BENDER,"Come on guy's, Pharaoh's countin' on us. Work faster, like this.  You call that motivating me? Don't just whip with your arms. The power comes from your hips. Like this."
11000,LEELA,"Bender, quit giving the slave drivers pointers!"
11001,FRY,"Yeah, remember who your real friends are."
11002,BENDER,I'll tell you who I remember.  Enupsis! Pleeltut! Whatsisname! He was the greatest of all.
11003,OSIRAN,Pharaoh Hermenthotip approaches.
11004,BENDER,"Hurry! Hurry! Pharaoh's coming! Get that nose in place, come on!"
11005,HERMENTHOTIP,Excellent work! I am very proud of all you slaves.
11006,BENDER,Woohoo! Viva Hermenthotip!
11007,HERMENTHOTIP,"And now, I have a grand announcement. In honour of your achievement, you're all hereby -"
11008,BENDER,(screaming) Nooo!
11009,HERMENTHOTIP,(hoarse) Tell the slaves they can all go.
11010,BENDER,Go faster? I told them but they're so damn lazy.
11011,HERMENTHOTIP,(hoarse) No. I mean they are all free.
11012,BENDER,Freeloading off you? I agree.
11013,HERMENTHOTIP,"(hoarse) No, I -"
11014,OSIRAN,Pharaoh Hermenthotip is dead.
11015,BENDER,(crying) He's whippin' angels now.
11016,HIGH PRIEST,We commend the body of Hermenthotip to the abode of the damned. The damned good looking!  Pharaoh commanded me to tell that joke at his funeral.
11017,BENDER,(crying) I'll always remember you Hermenthotip!
11018,HIGH PRIEST,"To equip Pharaoh for his journey we bury him with his favourite possessions. Such as his heart and liver.  And the many goods he left in his royal garage. Also, this bag of cat's our culture considers holy."
11019,SINGER,"(singing) Pharaoh my God-king you are, cold and deceased. I used to have him sing...P-P-P-Pharaoh and his pets...but the years went by and Pharaoh died, Suzie will have joined him in the afterlife -"
11020,OSIRAN,"Hermenthotip is gone, the time to designate a new Pharaoh is at hand."
11021,BENDER,Wow!
11022,OSIRAN,At dawn tomrrow the high priest will consult the Wall Of Prophecy to determine Hermenthotip's successor.
11023,BENDER,Woo!
11024,OSIRAN,That concludes the funeral. You don't have to go home but you can't stay here.
11025,FRY,Can you believe it? Pharaoh's dead!
11026,SLAVE #1,Yes! Tonight we are slaves to no one - except the rhythm!
11027,LEELA,Yeah! Play those bongos!
11028,FRY,I'm gonna spin til I fall down!
11029,BENDER,We interrupt this prophecy to bring you late breaking bulletin. He hammers the back of his head and creates and imprint of himself on the wall.
11030,HIGH PRIEST,"Great Wall Of Prophecy, reveal to us God's will that we will blindly obey."
11031,PRIESTS,(chanting) Free us from thought and responsibility.
11032,HIGH PRIEST,We shall read things off you.
11033,PRIESTS,(chanting) Then do them.
11034,HIGH PRIEST,Your words guide us.
11035,PRIESTS,(chanting) We're dumb.
11036,FRY,You know what else stinks about being a slave? The hours.
11037,HIGH PRIEST,"The prophecy is strange and...crudely drawn at best. It indicates that, we are ""here"" and our next Pharaoh is over there near some...tents."
11038,BENDER [FROM REEDS],"Those are waves jackass, it's supposed to be a river!"
11039,FRY,"Hey, I think I know who the next Pharaoh is!"
11040,LEELA,Oh Lord!
11041,HIGH PRIEST,We hear your voice great Pharaoh. Reveal yourself to us.
11042,BENDER,Behold! I have emerged from the place of spells and fairies!
11043,HIGH PRIEST,It is he. Just as the Wall Of Prophecy prophesied.  Long live Pharaoh Bender!
11044,SLAVES,(chanting) Long live Pharaoh Bender!
11045,LEELA,This society is a bunch of idiots.
11046,HIGH PRIEST,"People of Osiris 4, please welcome a man who started as a slave but worked his way up to lord of all creation! Our new Pharaoh - Bender!"
11047,BENDER,Citizens of Me! The cruelty of the old Pharaoh is a thing of the past.  Let a whole new wave of cruelty wash over this lazy land.
11048,LEELA,What did he say?
11049,BENDER,Hear the word of Pharaoh. Build unto me a statue of ridiculous proportion. One billion cubits in height......that I might be remembered for all eternity. And be quick about it!
11050,BENDER,Lowly slave. Why are you not working?
11051,SLAVE #2,I am.
11052,BENDER,I meant yourself to death.
11053,SLAVE #3,"Mighty Pharaoh, it hurts when I breathe."
11054,BENDER,Well then what do you think you should stop doing?  Crawl pigs!
11055,LEELA,Ow!
11056,BENDER,The Pharaoh has spoken.
11057,BENDER,Your task is nearly completed. Don't let down Pharaoh now.
11058,OSIRAN,"The great monument is finished oh Pharaoh. And now, the unveiling."
11059,STATUE,Remember me.  Remember me.  Remember me.
11060,OSIRAN,Does it please you my lord?
11061,BENDER,"Hmm...its a good start. Uh...yeah it's definately big alright. I just wonder if it's too big y'know? I mean, are people gonna be remembering me or the statue?"
11062,HIGH PRIEST,"But sire, we made it to your exact specifications."
11063,BENDER,Too exact if you ask me. Tear it down and start again. But this time don't embarrass yourselves.
11064,HIGH PRIEST,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Pharaoh...suddenly died!"
11065,LEELA,Good riddance.
11066,BENDER [FROM TOMB],What about my servants?
11067,PRIEST,Oh yeah.
11068,FRY,"Bender, I really hope that's you. 'Cause if it isn't......we're in trouble!"
11069,LEELA,You jerk. Why'd you have to drag us along?
11070,BENDER,I wanted to watch you remember me.
11071,LEELA,Did you really think you'd need all this junk in the afterlife?
11072,BENDER,Afterlife? Pfft. If I thought I had to go through a whole other life I'd kill myself right now!
11073,LEELA,Well rot in peace. Fry and I are leaving.
11074,BENDER,"Sorry but we're totally sealed in. Nothing can get in or out. Except millions of snakes.  Here, have a pomergranate scnapps from my private distillery and start sharing fond memories of me, Bender."
11075,FRY,What proof is this? Some huge number?
11076,LEELA,It's explosive! Maybe we could escape by setting fire to the distillery and blowing this whole place to rubble! Let's get a little kindling going!
11077,BENDER,"No! You can't blow up my monument, I won't be remembered."
11078,LEELA,"Oh right, how selfish of me. We'll just stay here forever. Hey Fry, remember that robot ""Bender""?"
11079,FRY,Bend-er? Doesn't ring a bell.  Did you hear something Leela?
11080,LEELA,No. But I bet it wasn't someone who was good at stealing.
11081,BENDER,Stop it stop it! It's not right! You've crossed a line!
11082,FRY,Hey Leela you know who I remember...?
11083,BENDER,"Oh please, let it be me!"
11084,FRY,...That guy who used to bend things. You know...?
11085,BENDER,"Me, please!"
11086,FRY,...Hermes.
11087,BENDER,"Alright alright! If it means that much to you, blow up my statue!"
11088,LEELA,Oh Bender! When did you come in? Hold still!  Let's blow this tomb!
11089,SLAVE #1,Pharaoh Bender! He once more walks among the living!
11090,STATUE,Remember me!
11091,BENDER,"(crying) I will. I will.  Please, just leave me alone."
11092,LEELA,"Bender, I understand your desire to be remembered. But you don't need a statue for that."
11093,BENDER,(crying) I don't?
11094,LEELA,No. You have your legacy as a brutal tyrannical dictator. And that will outlive any monument.
11095,BENDER,You really think they'll remember me?
11096,FRY,Absolutely.
11097,BENDER,Well in that case. One planet down! Helmsman...
11098,BENDER [FROM SHIP],...set course for Earth!
11099,LEELA [FROM SHIP],That's not Earth.
11100,BENDER [FROM SHIP],Oh.
11101,THE END,
11102,"""GODFELLAS""",
11103,LEELA,Space pirates!
11104,FRY,Space pirates?
11105,LEELA,"You know, pirates - but in space."
11106,PIRATE [ON SCREEN],Avast mateys!
11107,PIRATE,Electronically transfer your space doubloons afore I send thee to Davey Jarg's locker!
11108,BENDER,(shouting) Hey! Keep it down you kids! I'm trying to take a nap!
11109,FRY,"Come on, come on."
11110,BENDER,(muttering) ...make Bender take a nap in a tube.  (sexfully) Come back when I've had some sleep baby!
11111,LEELA,Fry to battlestations. Fire torpedo number three.
11112,FRY,Firing torpedo number three!
11113,BENDER,Huh? What?
11114,LEELA,That's not torpedo three. That's not torpedo three at all.
11115,BENDER,Damn you Fry and Lee......la!
11116,PIRATE [FROM SHIP],Too late do I realise that my children are my only real treasures.
11117,BENDER,(shouting) Help! Mechanical man overboard!
11118,FRY,Go after him Leela!
11119,LEELA,It's no use. We were going full speed when we fired him so he's going even faster than that.
11120,FRY,You mean we can never catch up to him? Not even if we rub the engine with cheetah blood?
11121,LEELA,I don't know how to say this Fry. But Bender is doomed to drift through space...forever.
11122,FRY,(solemn) He always wanted to drift forever. But through the American Southwest.
11123,BENDER,"I'm going too fast. I've gotta lose momentum.  Ohh. I'm gonna spend eternity alone with barely any swag.  Ooo! Hey universe! Check out the dude with the rolex!  Wow! Ostentatious!  Except what good is a candelabra without - wait I know!  Ah the pity. Fated to drift forever through the void as gravity's plaything. Oh cruel fate, to be thusly boned. Ask not for whom the bone bones. It bones for thee. The only thing that keeps me sane is the thought that I have all eternity in which to perfect my art.  Ohh!  Damn you!"
11124,BENDER,There. Now when I'm found in a million years people will know what the score was.  Hey what's bombarding me?  Oh no! An asteroid field. If even a pea sized asteroid were to whiz through my skull it could -  Ow! Hurt slightly! Well that was fun. Now for eons of loneliness.
11125,BENDER,Huh?
11126,SHRIMPKIN PRIEST,"Fellow Shrimpkins, behold he who hath taken us unto his breast."
11127,BENDER,Holy frijoles!
11128,SHRIMPKIN PRIEST,All bow before the great Metal Lord!
11129,BENDER,Worshippers? This ought to liven up my endless tragic voyage.
11130,SHRIMPKIN PRIEST,All hail the Metal Lord!
11131,SHRIMPKINS,(chanting) So hailed!
11132,BENDER,"Hmm, those peewees think I'm God huh? Hard to blame 'em!  I am the Metal Lord. Who are you?"
11133,MALACHI,"I am called Malachi, Lord. It means, um, ""He who really loves the Metal Lord."""
11134,BENDER,Listen here Malachi. Time for a religious donation. Hand over your wallet.
11135,MALACHI,But Lord. We are a poor and simple folk.
11136,BENDER,Poor? Oh crap.
11137,MALACHI'S WIFE,What art thou doing Malachi Jr?
11138,MALACHI JR,I'm practising to hug daddy when he gets back from God.  Mmm! Mmm!
11139,BENDER,"Eck! Gag unto me with a spoon! Malachi, it's high time I laid down a few commandments. You got a chisel? Take this down.  Number one -"
11140,MALACHI,Behold: The One Commandment.
11141,BENDER,(shouting) Make it a double!
11142,FRY,Can you find him Professor?
11143,FARNSWORTH,No. I'm afraid the smelloscope isn't powerful enough. Bender's odour is so mild it's being overpowered by local sources.
11144,ZOIDBERG,"Hooray, people are paying attention to me!"
11145,AMY,"Fry, we brought someone to cheer you up."
11146,HERMES,His name is Helper and he's eager to be your new best friend.
11147,HELPER,Hello there chum. I understand you miss your buddy! Have a pudding pop!
11148,FRY,No that's I don't -
11149,HELPER,Who wants to go to an amusement park?
11150,FRY,"Well, I guess that sounds OK."
11151,HELPER,"Have a good time. Hey, I hear your friend Bender is back."
11152,FRY,What? Really?
11153,HELPER,No. I just thought you would enjoy that for a moment.
11154,BENDER,"Ooo! Microbrewed! My guys did alright! I think I'll make my countenance to shine down upon them!  Malachi, good work. There's no slowing down with the Metal Lord tonight."
11155,MALACHI,"Yes, tonight is kind of special."
11156,BENDER,Wait a second. Did you rip off your own arm as a joke?
11157,MALACHI,"Nay. Like most of your followers I was maimed while building the great brewery. Others died from the pestelent fumes it spewed forth.  And of course, the liquor industry attracted organised crime."
11158,BENDER,"Aw, it's all my fault. Malachi, tell thy people that the Lord is moved by their plight."
11159,MALACHI'S WIFE,"Malachi Jr, no!"
11160,MALACHI JR,"Daddy, I can't hold much longer. My arms are tired from hugging."
11161,MALACHI,Save him! Save my son oh Metal Lord!
11162,BENDER,"This looks like a job for God!  What the? Malachi, what manner of deal is this with the chanting?"
11163,MALACHI,They saw you save my son. Now everyone is praying for their own miracles.
11164,BENDER,Very well. What do they want?
11165,MALACHI,The people of that village pray for wealth.
11166,BENDER,"Um, that was a practice miracle. Who's next?"
11167,MALACHI,The farmers pray for sunlight so that their barley might make a more refreshing beer for today's God on the go.
11168,BENDER,Very well. Let there be light.
11169,FARMER #1,Yippee!
11170,FARMER #2,Hooray!
11171,BENDER,"I got it I got it!  Um, when you're writing the Bible, you might want to omit that last miracle."
11172,FRY,"He decided not to let go.  I can't believe you're gone. I won't! If I can't reach you physically, I'll just have to try something desperately crazy!"
11173,FRY,So that's my story Father Changstein el Gamahl. Is there anything religion can do to help me find my friend?
11174,PRIEST,"Well, we could join together in prayer."
11175,FRY,Uh-huh but is there anything useful we can do?
11176,PRIEST,No.
11177,GYPSY,"Sure I hold séance, channel your friend no problem. Insert coin.  I am your friend...Bonder."
11178,FRY,Bonder? Is it really you?
11179,GYPSY,Yes. I am fine. Give the gypsy $10.
11180,FRY,"Wait a minute. Bender's name isn't Bonder, it's Bender. You're a fraud!"
11181,GYPSY,"Look, you want false hope or not?"
11182,FRY,Only if you don't have any real hope.
11183,GYPSY,"Well, there is perhaps one way. Have you heard of the Monks Of The Shubah?"
11184,FRY,I've not heard of them.
11185,GYPSY,"They are an ancient order who believe God exists in the depths of space. They have built the universe's most powerful radio telescope, high in the Himalayas, to search for him."
11186,FRY,You think they'd let me use it to look for Bender?
11187,GYPSY,"What am I psychic? I mean yes! Yes, I'm sure they will. Yes."
11188,MALACHI,"Oh Metal Lord, hear my prayer."
11189,BENDER,(irrate) Yes Malachi what is it this time?
11190,MALACHI,"My Lord, the infidels on your back no longer believe in you. They say their prayers go unheeded."
11191,BENDER,Of course they're unheeded how am I supposed to hear prayers coming out of my ass?
11192,MALACHI,"They talk of war against the faithful. I beseech thee. Rise up against them, smite someone who deserves it for once."
11193,BENDER,"Malachi, every time I interfere I only make things worse. You're best off solving your own problems."
11194,MALACHI,"But, but Metal Lord."
11195,BENDER,"What part of ""nay"" doesn't thou understand?"
11196,FRY,"Sir, I'm outfitting an expedition to a monestary high in the Himalayas. I'll need a long sleeved coat."
11197,LEELA,"Look, I miss Bender almost half as much as you do but you can't bring him back this way. It's hopeless."
11198,FRY,"You can't give up hope just because it's hopeless. You gotta hope even more and cover your ears and go ""blah blah blah blah blah blah blah!""  (shouting) I'd also like a pack mule."
11199,SALESMAN,(shouting) At once sir!
11200,LEELA,"Well, you obviously won't listen to reason, so I guess I'll listen to idioticness and come with you. But we'll need a Sherpa to guide us."
11201,BENDER,Now that's one Bible that doesn't disappoint on every page! Looks like my society's running pretty well without my meddling - huh?  Atomic bombs? Oh no! Those unbelievers from my backside must have found my nuclear pile!
11202,MALACHI,"Fear not my Lord, we shall be with you soon."
11203,BENDER,You're with me now. This is the maximum level of being with me!
11204,MALACHI,We will solve our own problems as you commanded. The time has come to convert the unbelievers.
11205,BENDER,Convert them?
11206,MALACHI,To radioactive vapour!
11207,MALACHI JR,Look Daddy! I'm hugging God! Mmm! Mmm! Maybe if I hug him real hard he'll save us from -
11208,BENDER,(crying) No!  (laughing) Ooo it tickles!
11209,BENDER,Hello? Is anyone still alive? How about in the porno theatre?  Don't be embarrassed. (crying) They're dead. All dead. Who would have known playing God could have such terrible consequences?
11210,LEELA,"(shouting) Fry, if I drop dead from exhaustion make sure my body freezes in a dignified position. None of that huddled over for warmth crap."
11211,SHERPA,Behold. The Monastery Of The Shubah. I must leave you now for I am not holy enough to enter.
11212,FRY,
11213,LEELA,Looks rickety. We'd better test it.
11214,FEMALE VOICE,Welcome to our monastery. Please stand to one side to let faster pilgrims by.
11215,BENDER,"Hey, that galaxy's signalling in binary! I gotta signal back! But I only know enough binary to as where the bathroom is. (shouting) You speak English?"
11216,GALAXY,I do now.
11217,BENDER,What are you some kind of galactic computer?
11218,GALAXY,Possible. I am user friendly. My good chum.
11219,BENDER,Who built you?
11220,GALAXY,I have always been.
11221,BENDER,Oh my God. Are you God?
11222,GOD,Possible. I do feel compasson for all living things. My good chum.
11223,BENDER,"But why would God think in binary? Unless...you're not God, but the remains of a computerised space probe that collided with God."
11224,GOD,That seems probable.
11225,MONK #1,"A member of our brotherhood sits at these controls every hour of every day, scanning the heavens for God."
11226,MONK #2,"There he is! No. No, wait, no."
11227,LEELA,How long have you been at it?
11228,MONK #1,"700 years. We've not yet examined one ten-millionth of the sky. But we will go on until we find the Almighty, even if it takes until the end of time."
11229,FRY,And then what?
11230,MONK #1,"Then we utter unto him a short prayer. You see, the telescope is also an amplifying transmitter."
11231,LEELA,Sort of like a giant kareoke machine?
11232,MONK #1,Not really. Would you like to see our giant kareoke machine?
11233,LEELA,Not really.
11234,FRY,"Hmm, finding God, that - that's important, yeah. But you know what might be a treat for everyone? If you let me use the telescope to find my lost friend Bender."
11235,MONK #1,"I don't know what to say, other than absolutely not. Your loss is a tragedy but our work -"
11236,FRY,"Aw c'mon, you guys have forever to look for God. All I'm asking is one measley lifetime to find my friend."
11237,MONK #2,He speaks out of love for his friend. Perhaps that love in his heart is God!
11238,MONK #1,Oh how convenient. A theory about God that doesn't require looking through a telescope. Get back to work!
11239,FRY,That telescope is as much mine as it is anybody's. I'm using it whether you give me permission or not.
11240,LEELA,Heyya! You're order may be famous for it's martial arts. But I've never met a holy man I couldn't clobber.
11241,MONK #1,Actually we only practice martial arts as a form of meditation. We are a strictly non-violent sect.
11242,LEELA,Oh. Then get in the laundry room or I'll kick your butts!
11243,MONK #3,This is the worst crazy sect I've ever been in.
11244,BENDER,"So, do you know what I'm gonna do before I do it?"
11245,GOD,Yes.
11246,BENDER,What if I do something different?
11247,GOD,Then I don't know that.
11248,BENDER,Cool cool! I bet a lot of people pray to you huh?
11249,GOD,"Yes, but there are so many asking so much. After a while you just sorta tune it out."
11250,BENDER,"Y'know, I was God once."
11251,GOD,Yes I saw. You were doing well until everyone died.
11252,BENDER,It was awful. I tried helping them. I tried not helping them but in the end I couldn't do them any good. Do you think what I did was wrong?
11253,GOD,Right and wrong are just words. What matters is what you do.
11254,BENDER,"Yeah I know, that's why I asked if what I did - forget it."
11255,GOD,"Bender, being God isn't easy, if you do too much, people get dependent. And if you do nothing, they lose hope. You have to use a light touch, like a safecracker or a pickpocket."
11256,BENDER,Or a guy who burns down the bar for the insurance money.
11257,GOD,"Yes, if you make it look like an electrical thing. When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all."
11258,BENDER,Does that mean you wouldn't send me back to Earth even if I prayed to you?
11259,GOD,Earth? Which way is that?
11260,BENDER,(sadly) I don't know.
11261,FRY,Bender? Bender?
11262,FRY,Hello? Has anyone out there seen Bender?
11263,LRRR [ON SPEAKER],"No, quit asking."
11264,LEELA,"Fry, it's been three days. And even if you stay here the rest of your life, there is virtually no chance of finding him. It's time to give up."
11265,FRY,"(sadly) You're right. I'm never gonna see him again. I know he was evil and on more than one occasion he, he actually stole my blood.  But still, I wish I had Bender back."
11266,GOD,Huh?
11267,BENDER,Huh? Wha? You say something?
11268,GOD,"No, no. Well so long. Remember what we talked about."
11269,BENDER,Hot hot hot hot!
11270,FRY,Bender! It's a miracle!  Ow!
11271,LEELA,This is by a wide margin the least likely thing that has ever happened.
11272,BENDER,"Guys, you'll never believe what happened. First I was God then I met God!"
11273,FRY,We climbed a mountain and locked up some monks.
11274,LEELA,Oh no the monks. We forgot to let them out of the laundry room.
11275,FRY,Do we have to? I mean they're monks. I'm sure their God will let them out or at least give them more shoes to eat.
11276,BENDER,Fat chance. You can't count on God for jack. He pretty much told me so himself. Now come on. If we don't save those monks no one will!
11277,GOD,"When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all."
11278,THE END,
11279,"""FUTURE STOCK""",
11280,MAN,"Yes, good thing I noticed the similar shapes."
11281,FARNSWORTH,Ohh!
11282,AMY,There he is!
11283,HATTIE (SHOUTING),Take it off!
11284,FARNSWORTH,Where am I?
11285,HERMES,Move forward. Walk into the light.
11286,FARNSWORTH,"Oh God! I'm dead. Well, no matter. (reading) Thank you all for coming. I don't recognise any of you, nor can I recall why I am here. Now without further ado, a film highlighting Planet Express Inc.'s latest fiscal year."
11287,NARRATOR [IN FILM],"Planet Express is on the move. For this young, hip delivery compnay, tomorrow is today and today is yesterday. You heard me.  It was a year of soaring profits and significant one time losses."
11288,ZOIDBERG,"I'll not only help you find it, I'll help you do more to it!"
11289,FRY,"Ooo, a bot-mitzvah. Shalom hunger, shalom free food!"
11290,ROBOT #1,No shellfish!
11291,ZOIDBERG,That is so unfair!
11292,PIG,Tell me about it.
11293,FRY,So what's the deal? You guys don't believe in Robot Jesus?
11294,ROBOT #2,We believe he was built and that he was a very well programmed robot but he wasn't our Messiah.
11295,NARRATOR [IN FILM],"And so our company flames onwards. Planet Express: Limitless potential, boundless horizons, the unstoppable juggernaut of the corporate universe."
11296,HERMES,It's been a terrible year people. The company is on the verge of bankruptcy.
11297,LEELA,But the movie -
11298,HERMES,Was a substantial loss for the company. The blue slice represent s the money we earned from shipping packages while the green slice represents an $8 bank error in our favour.
11299,LEELA,This toads the wet sprocket. What about our thousands of shares of stock?
11300,HERMES,Worthless.
11301,BENDER (SHOUTING),I'll kill you!
11302,HATTIE,I own one share of Planet kajiggers so I'm entitled to some answers. Question 1: Why does no one visit me in my home?
11303,FARNSWORTH,'Cause your apartment smells like Polygrip and cat pee.
11304,FRY,This is perfect for me.
11305,ZOIDBERG,"Question: Do you have to have been cryogenically frozen to get the free -  You didn't let me finish. I was going to say ""to get the free food."""
11306,JOE,My name's Joe and I'm a defrostee.
11307,EVERYONE,Hello Joe.
11308,JOE,When I was frozen giant carrots ruled the Earth. But now they don't. It takes some getting used to.
11309,THAT GUY,"Back in the 1980's I was the toast of Wall Street. I was having whiskey with Boesky and cookies with Milken. But then, I was diagnosed with terminal boneitis."
11310,FRY,Boneitis? Pft! That's a funny name for a horrible disease.
11311,THAT GUY,"There was no cure at the time. One drug company was close but I arranged a hostile takeover and sold off all the assets. Made a cool hundred mil.  Naturally I froze myself until a cure was found. Now here I am, ready to sleaze my way back to the top, 80's style!"
11312,CAVEMAN,As a caveman frozen in a glacier I face different challenges. (crying) The hardest thign was seeing my wife on display in the British Museum.
11313,THAT GUY,Sure do! We can dance!
11314,FRY,Y'know that dance wasn't as safe as they said it was.
11315,THAT GUY,"I tell you, two go-go 80's Reganauts like us, we could rule this world!"
11316,FRY,No question.
11317,THAT GUY,If only someone would give us a shot.
11318,FRY,"They're scared of our raw power. Oh but if you want a job, I could beg everyone at the company where I work."
11319,THAT GUY,Awesome. Awesome to the max!
11320,HERMES,"And finally, the post office meter is for business mail only."
11321,BENDER,Aw come on! I got a lot of ransom notes to send!
11322,HATTIE,Enough talk. It's time for action. I move that everyone come to my apartment to snuggle my cat.
11323,SCRUFFY,Second.
11324,FARNSWORTH,I move that your cat stinks and is ugly.
11325,SCRUFFY,Second.
11326,HATTIE,I move that we vote on a new Chief Executive Officer and oust this old creep. And also that make cat smells good and is pretty.
11327,SCRUFFY,Second.
11328,HERMES,Very well. I nominate the Professor.
11329,AMY,Second.
11330,LEELA,Second.
11331,BENDER,Second.
11332,FARNSWORTH,I'm your man.
11333,LEELA,"I vote my 10,000 shares for the Professor."
11334,HERMES,Yeah the Professor!
11335,FARNSWORTH,Me!
11336,FRY,I nominate That Guy. Not just because he has a suit but because he knows about business and stuff and he has a tie. My shares still count if they went through the washing machine right?
11337,HERMES,"Well, if I know anything about which number is bigger than the other number, I'd say that -"
11338,SCRUFFY,"Hold on there. Scruffy votes his 40,000 shares for the mysterious stranger."
11339,LEELA,"40,000? How come you have four times as much stock as the rest of us?"
11340,SCRUFFY,Scruffy believes in this company.
11341,HERMES,"Then we have a tie. And in the event of a tie the Professor, as the current CEO remains -"
11342,HATTIE,I demand the floor. I may only have one share but I get to vote same as anyone. And I'm voting against the cat hater.  Isn't that right kitty?  Hey! You ate my change!
11343,HERMES,Then it's settled. The new chief executive officer of Planet Express corporation is That Guy.
11344,HERMES,"Please welcome our new chief executive officer, That Guy."
11345,THAT GUY,Let's cut to the chase. There are two kinds of people: sheep and sharks. Anyone who's a sheep is fired. Who's a sheep?
11346,ZOIDBERG,Uh excuse me? Which is the one people like to hug?
11347,THAT GUY,"Gutsy question, you're a shark. Sharks are winners and they don't look back 'cause they don't have necks. Necks are for sheep.  I am proud to be the shepherd of this herd of sharks and I am gonna lead you to the top of this industry of...of..."
11348,FRY (WHISPERING),Package delivery.
11349,THAT GUY,Package delviery? Oh God!  Fantastic! Now the first order of business is to blame everything on the guy before me. Professor?
11350,FARNSWORTH,I'll ruin you like I ruined this company.
11351,THAT GUY,Terrific. Question number one: What was your overall business plan?
11352,FARNSWORTH,"Uh, um, uh business plan, uh, yes. I keep it here - right next to my heart."
11353,THAT GUY,"This isn't a business plan, it's an escape plan."
11354,FARNSWORTH,So long suckers!
11355,THAT GUY,"Fry, as a fellow 80's dollar jockey, I'm making you my new vice chairman."
11356,FRY,I'm rollin' up the corporate ramp.
11357,BENDER,Ohh!
11358,ZOIDBERG,It's the end of the line!
11359,HERMES,We're ruined!
11360,SCRUFFY,What fevered dream is this that bids to tear this company in twain?
11361,MONSTER,Thank you come again!
11362,THAT GUY,That's what I call a hostile makeover! Hair gel?
11363,FRY,No thanks I make my own.
11364,THAT GUY,This company's gonna shoot straight to the top and stay there! Like Cindy Lauper! I ask you: Who is the number one delivery service on Earth?
11365,ZOIDBERG,Is it Planet Express master?
11366,THAT GUY,Is this guy a shark or what? Seriously though we stink out loud. Here's the big enchirito.  Mom's Friendly Delivery Company.
11367,HERMES,"We can't compete with Mom! Her company is big, and evil. Ours is small and neutral."
11368,THAT GUY,Switzerland is small and neutral. We're more like Germany; ambitious and misunderstood.
11369,AMY,"Look, everyone wants to be like Germany but do we really have the pure strength of will?"
11370,THAT GUY,I say we do! Now are we gonna let ourselves be beaten by an old lady?
11371,ZOIDBERG,Yes my liege!
11372,FRY,"No we're not. And as vice chairman, I believe I speak for the entire board when I issue this challenge to Mom. Look at my butt!"
11373,MOM,"You call that a pressed ham? Walt, hit the retaliate button."
11374,WALT,"Uh, um, hmm lets see."
11375,MOM,Any button they all retaliate!
11376,FRY,Woo yeah! Hit him hit him hit him! Now this is the high life! Watching apes mangle each other near celebrities!
11377,THAT GUY,In my day we went to coke parties but the principle's the same.
11378,CALCULON,Get your stinkin' trike off me you damn dirty ape.
11379,THAT GUY,"Listen big guy, now that you're my prodégé, it's time I cut you in on the secret to success. Any guesses?"
11380,FRY,"Uh, work really really hard?"
11381,THAT GUY,No.
11382,FRY,Oh thank God!
11383,THAT GUY,It's all about appearances. That's why its time to update our company's stodgy image and give it the sleek dazzling veneer of the 1980's!
11384,FRY,This company's on the fast track to the It List! Blast back kudos all around!
11385,LEELA,Uh hello? We haven't made one delivery since you two took over.
11386,THAT GUY,"Delivery has nothing to do with the delivery business. Image people, image! Scope out this new ad!"
11387,MOM [ON AD],"We are all one. With one mind, one purpose and one act. Our enemy shall be eaten by scorpions!  We shall bow down and worship to ourselves.  We shall prevail!"
11388,MAN [ON AD],Hey! We were watching that!
11389,LEELA,That was terrible! People won't even know what we do.
11390,BENDER,"I don't even know what we do. Nah just kidding, what are like a bus or something?"
11391,LEELA,Did you approve that awful ad Fry?
11392,FRY,Yes I did Leels! And I'll tell you why. Because it grows the brand.
11393,LEELA,Oh Lord!
11394,ZOIDBERG,This company's circling the drain I tell you. I'd sell my stock right now for a sangwich!
11395,THAT GUY,Sold!
11396,ZOIDBERG,A complete sangwich?  You got fleeced! I would have settled for a hard roll with ketchup inside!
11397,MOM,What is this moose drip?  The new delivery kings? I'm sick of hearing about those turtle squirts!
11398,IGNER,But they're kings mommy!
11399,MOM,Jam a bastard in it you crap!
11400,ELZAR,Enjoy our private dining room folks! This is where we serve our richest most successful chumps!
11401,FRY,"Tonight, that's us!"
11402,THAT GUY,What have you got that's really overpriced?
11403,ELZAR,Everything.
11404,THAT GUY,Bring me that.
11405,FRY,Make it two. And a glass of all your water.
11406,THAT GUY,"OK, lets work on your execu-speak. I'm worried about ""blank."""
11407,FRY,"Don't you worry about ""blank"" let me worry about ""blank."""
11408,THAT GUY,"Very good. I also would have accepted ""Blank? Blank?! you're not looking at the big picture!"""
11409,FRY (WEAKLY),What a pleasant surprise!
11410,MOM,Shut up booger blaster! It's time the three of us had a talk.
11411,THAT GUY,"I'll handle this Fry. You get back to the farm, shift some paradigms, revolutionise outside the box."
11412,FRY,I'm on it. But if you need me you know where I'll be.
11413,LEELA,Fry we're worried about Planet Express.
11414,FRY,Don't you worry about Planet Express. Let me worry about blank!
11415,HERMES,That Guy is nothing but a flashy con man! And you've been hypnotised by his swinging blogney!
11416,LEELA,You've changed Fry.
11417,FRY,What? I haven't changed.  Suz? Have I changed?
11418,SUZ [ON INTERCOM],No sir Mr Fry.
11419,FRY,Thanks doll.
11420,LEELA,"I don't care what Ms Johnson says, Thst Guy's turning this place into some kind of...business."
11421,FARNSWORTH,"This isn't a business, I've always thought of it as more of a source of cheap labour. Like a family."
11422,FRY,"You're right Professor. We might not be a traditional family like the Murphy's next door or the lesbian coven across the street but we are a family, and That Guy understands that."
11423,THAT GUY [ON SCREEN],Everyone's fired and we're out of business.
11424,AMY,Oh no.
11425,HERMES,How?
11426,THAT GUY [ON SCREEN],I'm gonna sell Planet Express to Mom so she can gut the company and eliminate us as competitors.
11427,MOM [ON SCREEN],Don't let the door hit you on your way out. 'Cause I don't want ass prints on my new door!
11428,FRY,Uh Ms Johnson? Please bring in some more chair fuel.
11429,FRY,I had no idea the company would be sold. I was just an innocent suck up. You've gotta believe me!
11430,LEELA,Just leave us alone and let us clear out our lockers.
11431,BENDER,Yeah.
11432,AMY (CRYING),"It's so sad, where will I go? What will I do?"
11433,LACKEY,You have Mrs Darlinghaven's cotillion at 7 ma'am.
11434,AMY (CRYING),Oh. That'll be fun.
11435,FRY,"Ms Johnson, you've never lied to me. Am I still a good person?"
11436,SUZ [ON INTERCOM],I don't know sir. I'm a program built into the intercom.
11437,FRY,"I've got to redeem myself. Somehow, sometime, for some reason. I'll block this takeover!"
11438,SUZ [ON INTERCOM],"Mr Fry, your 2 o'clock magician is here."
11439,FRY,"Believe it or not, I have more important things to do today than laugh and clap my hands.  Reschedule."
11440,BROKERBOT #1,Sell 100 soylent beans!
11441,BROKERBOT #2,Buy 1000 cornbellies!
11442,BROKERBOT #3,200 cans of whoop-ass!
11443,BROKERBOT #1,Three big bags of trash!
11444,JOR-EL,Attention please. The takeover of PlanEx Corp by Mom's Friendly Company will take place in the business centre in 10 minutes. I am Jor-El! Master of scheduling!
11445,THAT GUY,"OK, we've got the hot tub hot, the wine cooler's cool. It's Hammer time!"
11446,BENDER,You suck!
11447,MOM,"According to regulations, both companies must approve the takeover. Planet Express shareholders, cast your votes."
11448,HERMES,Great Bonda of Uganda! We can vote against it!
11449,BENDER,I'll vote it down like a raise for school teachers!
11450,BENDER,What the?
11451,HATTIE,How the?
11452,AMY,Oh no.
11453,THAT GUY,I neglected to mention that the shares I bought from Dr Zoidberg gave me majority control.
11454,LEELA,Zoidberg owned 51% of the company?
11455,HERMES,The shares were worthless and he kept asking for toilet paper.
11456,MOM,And now if Momcorp shareholders will cast their ballots.
11457,IGNER,"Um...uh... Uh, the ballot was confusing."
11458,MOM,How about a hand recount?
11459,IGNER,OK.  Ow!
11460,MOM,The takeover of Planet Express is approved.
11461,AMY,This stinks!
11462,LACKEY,Madam is outraged.
11463,THAT GUY,"Security, I want that bunch of rowdies out of here."
11464,BENDER,Hold on a minute!
11465,SCRUFFY,Hey! Hey!
11466,MOM,Momcorp will now purchase all outstanding shares of Planet Express at the current market price which is...
11467,JOR-EL,107.
11468,BENDER,Ow! And also it hurt my feelings!
11469,LEELA,They are? Oh my God! I'm a millionaire! Suddenly I have an opinion about that capital gains tax!
11470,BENDER,Yeah all right!
11471,AMY,I'm even richer!
11472,ZOIDBERG,Oh! I have no shares!  Wait! My sangwich! Has it also appreciated in value?  Please oh please!
11473,HERMES,You didn't even refrigerate it you spineless lobster!
11474,ZOIDBERG,You had to drag spines into this!
11475,FRY [ON SCREEN],"As vice chairman of Planet Express I'd like to say a few words. There comes a time for every man who becomes rich and deserts his friends, when he goes back how it was. For me, that time is now...."
11476,FRY,"...So I ask you, as a friend, won't you stop this deal?"
11477,THAT GUY,Fry I'm an 80's guy. Friendship means to me that for two bucks I'd beat you with a pool cue 'til you got detached retinas. The deal will go ahead as - My bones!
11478,FRY,Oh my God! His boneitis!
11479,THAT GUY,"I was so busy being an 80's guy, I forgot to cure it.  My only regret is...that I have...boneitis!"
11480,FRY,He's dead.
11481,MOM,"Pry out his fillings, feed him to the jackals and lets get on with the sale."
11482,FRY,I don't think so. 'Cause as vice chairman of the company I gain voting control of his shares.
11483,MOM,Don't be a fool you idiot!
11484,FRY,I'll be whatever I wanna do! That Guy was the greatest businessman that ever lived and before his mysterious death he taught me everything he knew.  But some things I had to learn myself. I learned that money is fine but in the end what counts is people... ...People you love... ...You can't put a price on that... So I'm giving up control of the company... ...to a man of enourmous experience... ...Professor... ...Hubert Farnsworth.
11485,FARNSWORTH,"Oh uh what? I'm awake, I'm awake!"
11486,BENDER,"Fry, stop doing the right thing you jerk!"
11487,LEELA,Let Mom buy the company! We all wanna be filthy stinking rich!
11488,ZOIDBERG,Trust me two out of three doesn't cut it!
11489,FRY,You mean you'd rather be rich than work together?
11490,LEELA,Hell yeah!
11491,FRY,In my whole life this company was the only place I ever really felt at home. If being millionaires is more important to you than our...
11492,BENDER,It is!
11493,FRY,"...friendship, then I'll sell Planet Express, for you."
11494,HATTIE,Millionaires nothing! The stock's only worth three kajiggers!
11495,BENDER,Oh come on!
11496,HERMES,My Jah! It's worth less now than when it was worthless!
11497,FRY,It is? Yahoo! We're poor no matter what I do! The deal is off!
11498,ZOIDBERG,Aha! Once again the conservative sangwich-heavy portfolio pays off for the hungry investor! Oh! I'm ruined.  Why? Why?
11499,FRY,"Look, so we're not millionaires. At least we all still get to work together!"
11500,BENDER,Shut your fat mouth!
11501,FRY (SHOUTING),See you guys Monday!
11502,THE END,
11503,"""A LEELA OF HER OWN""",
11504,LEELA,Oh put down the binoculars Fry. The wall of that strip club isn't going to collapse twice in one day.
11505,FRY,"I know, and I've grown to accept that. Now I'm more interested in that new pizza parlour across the street. Kinda makes me pine for my days as a pizza delivery boy. ""Here's you pizza,"" I'd say. ""I didn't order any,"" they'd say. And then I'd be off to my next adventure."
11506,LEELA,That story stunk. Hand me the binoculars. I think the owner is from Cygnus 5.
11507,FARNSWORTH,Cygnoids? On our block? Flying foo! They should go back where they came from.
11508,LEELA,Professor please. Society's never gonna make any progress until we all learn to pretend to like each other. Now lets go over there and make these hideous strangers feel welcome.
11509,FARNSWORTH,No.
11510,CYGNOID WOMAN,You sure about these chairs? Guidebook says human legs bend down at knee.
11511,CYGNOID MAN,"It's OK Mama, anyone complains, I bend legs up for free.  Ooo customers!  Welcome to Earth pizza store. Here, sit, I bend knees for you."
11512,BENDER,Ooo that's a-comfy!
11513,CYGNOID MAN,"OK, now, what kind of pizza goes in you?  Silt? Asbestos? We got guano - very fresh!"
11514,FRY,"Uh, hmm, do you have any food?"
11515,CYGNOID MAN,"Here, try a deep dish pizza.  Contains four kind of things."
11516,LEELA,I don't mean to offend but this tastes like vomit.
11517,CYGNOID WOMAN,(happy) Thank you.
11518,LEELA,"No, actually I did mean to offend a little. This is awful."
11519,FRY,"Hey hey, what's wrong? Was it something Leela said?"
11520,CYGNOID WOMAN,"(crying) We come to Earth to start new life. Raise fat spoiled Earth kids, hang many underwear from Earth clothesline, live Earthican dream."
11521,FRY,"Aww, don't cry foreign people. I used to work in a pizzeria and as soon as I stop hallucinating and blasting puke, I'm gonna teach you to sell pizza - Earth style!"
11522,CYGNOID WOMAN,Oh thank you magic biped!
11523,CYGNOID MAN,"You save us sir, if we cannot make Earth pizza our dream will die. Just like rats we crushed to make the wine."
11524,FRY,"For starters, only use quality ingredients. Case in point: No more live bees.  Oregano works equally well. And when you put pizzas in the oven, don't get in with them."
11525,CYGNOID #2,"Hey, ocupado!"
11526,FRY,"Most important of all is the big screen TV. Human families need a TV when they're eating so they don't have to talk to each other.  Ah, the Earthican pasttime, blernsball!"
11527,UECKER [ON TV],"Mulligan drives the ball, it's going, going and caught by the shortstop. Man I haven't seen play this bad since the days of Bob Uecker! This is Bob Uecker saying thanks for watching!"
11528,CYGNOID MAN,Mets? Shortstop? Pinching the hitter? I don't understand this blernsball.
11529,FRY,Well if you're going to be Earthicans we'll have to teach you. How about your pizzeria plays a game against Planet Express? Oh but you'll need nine players.
11530,CYGNOID WOMAN,No problem!
11531,CYGNOID #2,Play the ball!
11532,FARNSWORTH,(shouting) Go team! Beat those no good Cygnoids! Show them they stink at a game they've never played before!
11533,CYGNOID MAN,"Ah, this is why I love Earth! Beautiful star brightened day, friendly blernsball game with chum pals! So pleasant for everybody."
11534,SCRUFFY,"Hit by a pitch, take your base."
11535,LEELA,"(shouting) Sorry about that, I guess I needed a few more warm-up pitches."
11536,BENDER,No batter! No batter!  No batter anymore.
11537,SCRUFFY,Take your base.
11538,LEELA,"(shouting) I didn't mean to hit you, I have some trouble with depth perception."
11539,CYGNOID #2,"Yeah, me too now."
11540,BENDER,Hey batter batter batter! Hey batter batter batter! Hey batter batter!  Duck!
11541,SCRUFFY,Take your base.
11542,CYGNOID #3,"Please lady, I want to live. Can I use bat to protect head?"
11543,BENDER,Apparently not.
11544,MAN,Check out the one eyed bean machine!
11545,CYGNOID MAN,Hooray! I make a score point!
11546,FRY,"Leela, you beaned a run-in. You'd better let me pitch."
11547,LEELA,But I've got a no-hitter going.  You're right. Here.
11548,RANDY,"Don't take her out, she's a firecracker!"
11549,COMMISSIONER,"Excuse me, I'd like to talk to you."
11550,LEELA,Am I under arrest?
11551,BENDER,Wait I know you. You're the sleabag who owns the Ultimate Robot Fighting League.
11552,COMMISSIONER,Not anymore. Now I'm the sleazebag who owns the New New York Mets.
11553,LEELA,The Mets? Those bums are worse than me.
11554,COMMISSIONER,Close to it. But they don't draw a crowd like you. Which is why I wanna sign you to the team.
11555,LEELA,You mean I'd be the first woman ever to play major league blernsball?
11556,COMMISSIONER,Well yeah but basically you'd just be a publicity stunt. I figured a one-eyed lady skull buster might bring out the freakshow crowd.
11557,LEELA,"Wow, the first woman ever to play major league blernsball."
11558,COMMISSIONER,"Again yeah, but basically you'd -"
11559,LEELA,Yippee!
11560,LEELA,Ta-da! The first woman ever to play major league blernsball. How do I look?
11561,HERMES,Like a sexy Yogi Berra!
11562,FARNSWORTH,Why is your number seven-eight's?
11563,LEELA,All the whole numbers have been retired.
11564,FRY,"Wow, I must say I'm impressed. You look just like a ball player. Can I pat you on the butt?"
11565,LEELA,Fry I'm a professional athlete! So go ahead.
11566,FRY,"Ohh, now I'm too nervous."
11567,UECKER,Well folks it's only the fifth inning but the Swedes have already turned this one into a laffer. And that's with two F's. The crowd is pouring out of the stadium LA style.
11568,COMMISSIONER,"Skipper, we're losing the crowd. Put it our new novelty act - Leela."
11569,SKIPPER,Darn it! I already put in the circus clown.
11570,COMMISSIONER,Yeah but he bunted. Clowns are only funny when they swing away.
11571,WOMAN,Woo! Come on! Throw like a girl!
11572,FRY,(shouting) Go Leela!
11573,BENDER,(shouting) Come on girl!
11574,AMY,(shouting) Too much eyeliner!
11575,UECKER,(voice-over) This is history in the making folks. Bjornson steps up to the plate and Leela delivers.
11576,BENDER,Bullseye!
11577,UECKER,(voice-over) Ooo! An inauspicious start for the career of the first woman blernsballer. An inauspicious continuation for the career of the first woman blernsballer.
11578,CROWD,(chanting) Bean! Bean! Bean! Bean! Bean! Bean! Bean! Bean...
11579,UECKER,Ouch! It's a three bean-ball salad. The Mets fans love it though and who can blame them? They haven't had much to cheer about this year -
11580,COMMISSIONER,"Kid that was great! You got us more publicity than a cowboy in a shark tank. Poor Tex, he was quite a shark."
11581,MAN #1,Hey!
11582,MAN #2,Hey!
11583,MAN #3,C'mon!
11584,MAN #4,I win!
11585,BENDER,Oop! Sorry.
11586,LEELA,"Bender, how did you get in here?"
11587,LEELA,Since when are you my agent?
11588,BENDER,"Quiet, call coming in.  Yeees...? A big endorsement deal for Leela? How much...? Hey! You put a one and two zeroes in front of that or we pass...! Deal!"
11589,LEELA,Bender that's great! How much did you get me?
11590,BENDER,(impressed) One hundred dollars.
11591,LEELA,"(reading) As a pitcher, I serve up plenty of bean-balls, so I know good beans when I see them. Bean-Bay Beans - they're the beaniest!"
11592,DIRECTOR,Cut!
11593,UECKER,(voice-over) In very short order Leela has become a fan favourite.
11594,BENDER,You're the best babe!  Hang on call comin' in.  What's that...? Hey you put a one and two zeroes in front of that or we pass...! Deal!
11595,LEELA,So what did you get me?
11596,BENDER,(impressed) A thousand and one pesos!
11597,LEELA,"Yo soy muy malo en lanzar, pero yo soy muy bueno en comer frijoles. Come los Bean Bay frijoles, los frijoles de los reyes."
11598,DIRECTOR,"Cut! OK, now do one with bean suit on!"
11599,CYGNOID MAN,Leela really bringing in the customers.
11600,CYGNOID WOMAN,This keep up we need to buy second sauce toilet.
11601,GIRL,When I grow up I want to injure men by throwing stuff at them just like you Leela! Will you sign my magazine?
11602,LEELA,"Aww, sure thing sweetie. Who should I make it out to?"
11603,GIRL,"Well, uh...to eBay?"
11604,LEELA,"That's a popular name today. Little ""e"" big ""B""?"
11605,BENDER,"Five bucks an autograph, 200 fans. Add a one and two zeros in front of that and we got ourselves a wad!"
11606,LEELA,I'm not doing this for the wad. I'm doing it for all the struggling female athletes who need a role model.
11607,WOMAN,"Yeah, a role model in how to stink!"
11608,LEELA,What? Who are you?
11609,WOMAN,Jackie Anderson. I'm on the blernsball team at NNYU and I was hoping to get to play in the majors soon.
11610,LEELA,"Oh, following in my footsteps?"
11611,JACKIE,"Pft, God forbid! Your little freakshow is making it impossible for real female ball players to be taken seriously. I hope you're proud of yourself."
11612,BENDER,"Alright shows over no refunds, you heard the robot get out!"
11613,LEELA,"I'm a fool. The fans haven't been cheering for me, they've been cheering at me."
11614,AMY,"Don't be upset Leela. You, um...you look really cute in your uniform."
11615,LEELA,(crying) That's what makes it so sad. I thought I was doing something heroic.
11616,BENDER,You are. What about that little girl you visited in the hospital? You know the one I mean? The one who died?
11617,LEELA,"You're right. I can't let people down anymore. As God as my witness, I vow to earn the respect of girls and women everywhere. I will become the best blernsball player of all time."
11618,HERMES,"That's statistically impossible. In 77 innings you haven't gotten a single out. At this rate, you're sure to go down as the worst blernsball player of all time."
11619,LEELA,Oh. Then I have a new vow. I solemnly swear that I will become not the worst blernsball player of all time.
11620,FRY,Hey look! The player's who broke the various colour barriers!
11621,BENDER,When will Man learn that all races are equally inferior to robots?
11622,LEELA,"Ah, here we are - the worst player in history. If I can be just a little better than him I can slink away with my head held high."
11623,BENDER,It says he once struck out when his tongue got stuck to an unusually cold bat.
11624,FRY,And here he is trying to make a catch with an oven mit.
11625,LEELA,It's even a crummy hologram.
11626,AARON JR,"I'm not a hologram, though I am crummy. Hank Aaron XXIV."
11627,FRY,Hank Aaron XXIV? How could you play so blowfully? The original Hank Aaron was great!
11628,AARON SR,No I was better than great. I was the home run king!
11629,BENDER,Neat!
11630,LEELA,"So Hank - the bad Hank, just how blowful were you?"
11631,AARON JR,"Well, I have a low batting average."
11632,AARON SR,Low? It was zero you fungo! You went your whole career without getting a hit.
11633,FRY,Leela could beat that. She's pitched her whole career without getting an out.
11634,AARON SR,"You stink lady! Hey Junior, she belongs in the exhibit instead of you."
11635,AARON JR,"Forget it. This job's too cushy to give up.  Aah Wade Boggs, goes down smooth!"
11636,LEELA,"Look, I don't wanna be in this exhibit. That's why I need your help - so I can be one tiny iota less pathetic than you."
11637,AARON JR,"Oh I can't help you play better than Tiny Iota, that guy was great! But I'll teach you everything I know."
11638,AARON JR,"OK, let's see what you can do."
11639,BENDER,One thing she can do is lodge a ball in the depth centre of your brain. You better get a batting helmet.
11640,LEELA,"(quietly) Alright, low and away!"
11641,AARON JR,OK try it again but this time keep your eye off the ball.
11642,LEELA,"You mean ""keep your eye on the ball""?"
11643,AARON JR,"Hey lady, which one of us is in the hall of fame?"
11644,FRY,"(whispering) Psst, you're holding the bat upside down."
11645,AARON JR,Just pitch the ball.
11646,LEELA,"OK, eye off the ball."
11647,BENDER,Strike!
11648,FRY,Hooray!
11649,AARON JR,You did it Leela!
11650,LEELA,I didn't hit the batter! For once I was pitching and not just belly-itching!
11651,AARON JR,Oh you got that too? I think there's a rash goin' around.
11652,UECKER,"Welcome to Fenway Park, home of the Boston Poindexters where the Mets close out a season that'll rank among mankind's most awful crimes."
11653,FRY,Hey! You opened a franchise!
11654,CYGNOID WOMAN,"Yes. Our biggest seller is Leela's Bean Pizza. Six kinds of beans, plus several things that look like beans."
11655,FISHY JOE,"Beans huh? Mmm, this is great! How to you make the crust so fizzy?"
11656,CYGNOID MAN,Ah-ah-ah! Ancient Cygnoid secret!
11657,CYGNOID WOMAN,"My husband, some hotshot! Here's his ancient Cygnoid secret!  Live hornets! We smush them right into dough!"
11658,FISHY JOE,I don't care if there's horse manure in it!
11659,CYGNOID MAN,That's a-good!
11660,FISHY JOE,"I wanna buy this franchise. How does $100,000 sounds?"
11661,CYGNOID MAN,"Forget it, we come to Earth to make pizza not money!"
11662,CYGNOID WOMAN,No Blek! Other way around!
11663,CYGNOID MAN,"Oh right, offer accepted!"
11664,UECKER,"Well fans Boston's turning the last game into a real squeeeker! And that's with three ""e's""! Two men on and they're down to their last out."
11665,LEELA,"Come on skipper, it's my last chance to prove I'm not the worst player ever. Please put me in."
11666,SKIPPER,No. We're actually winning this game. You only go in as a joke when we're eight runs behind. Or when our other pitchers sneak out early to beat the traffic.  (shouting) Come on! Lets see some fundamentals out there!  And not clown fundamentals.
11667,SKIPPER,"Aw, darn, darn it! Now the bases are loaded. Isn't there a man on this team who can get one more out?"
11668,LEELA,I can.
11669,SKIPPER,I repeat: Isn't there a man on this team on this -
11670,LEELA,I've been training with Hank Aaron.
11671,SKIPPER,You've been training with the Hank Aaron?
11672,LEELA,I've been training with a Hank Aaron.
11673,SKIPPER,Alright then. Get in there and pitch like you've never pitched like you before!
11674,CROWD,(chanting) Bean! Bean! Bean! Bean! Bean!
11675,FARNSWORTH,(shouting) Go Leela!
11676,AMY,(shouting) Come on Leela!
11677,BENDER,(shouting) Put it right down the pike!
11678,FRY,(shouting) Strike him out Leela! Do it for the hundreds of women everywhere!
11679,UECKER,Would you look at that! College blernsball's finest female hitter making her big league debut against pro-ball's worst female anything! I've never seen anything this bizzare - and I've seen Mr Belvendere naked! Woo!
11680,LEELA,"(quietly) Keep cool, she's just like any other player. She puts on her sports bra one arm at a time."
11681,UMPIRE,Strike one!
11682,LEELA,Strike one - a personal best!
11683,UMPIRE,Strike two!
11684,UECKER,"A grand slam blern. The Mets lose, their season is over! And no question, Leela - the first woman ever to reach the majors will go down as the single worst player in the history of blernsball...!"
11685,UECKER,(voice-over) ...And yet tonight we have witnessed the beginning of a great career for the first woman to play the sport well - Jackie Anderson!
11686,JACKIE,Leela?
11687,LEELA,"Jackie. I guess you were right, I'm a lousy role model. I'm sorry."
11688,JACKIE,"No, don't be. It turns out you were an inspiration afterall."
11689,LEELA,(crying) I was?
11690,JACKIE,"Uh-huh. You were so awful that women everywhere set out to prove that they don't stink as bad as you. You know, like a pig or something."
11691,LEELA,"Oh, that's so kind of you. I guess I made a difference afterall!"
11692,JACKIE,"You absolutely did Leela. Now please, please retire! Immediately!"
11693,LEELA,Hey kid! Catch!
11694,AARON SR,"Well, at least you're still the worst football player of all time."
11695,AARON JR,Yeah. Yeah.
11696,THE END,
11697,"""30% IRON CHEF""",
11698,MORBO [ON TV],"Welcome back. Our next guest has been teaching the world to cook for over 20 years. But apparently my uh, wife hasn't been listening."
11699,LINDA [ON TV],Oh funny!
11700,ELZAR [ON TV],"Morbo I'm gonna whip you up a nice, unnameable horror from beyond - with mango chutney."
11701,MORBO [ON TV],Pathetic humans! Prepare to write down the recipe!
11702,FRY,"Hey, uh, what's with all the pots and pans? You building a wife?"
11703,BENDER,Part of one. Meantime I'm cooking up a tasty Sunday brunch for my best friends!
11704,FRY,Brunch. Right. I'd better warn - tell - warntell the others!
11705,BENDER,Okey-dokey!
11706,HERMES,Ooo!
11707,LEELA,Nice!
11708,FARNSWORTH,"Yes, it's a perfect scale model of the universe's largest bottle. I put a tiny spaceship inside to keep it from being boring."
11709,ZOIDBERG,Ohh!
11710,FARNSWORTH,Get -!  For the last time Zoidberg look with your eyes not with your claws!
11711,FRY,Brace yourselves. Bender is making us brunch.
11712,ZOIDBERG,Oh boy!
11713,FARNSWORTH,Oh God! My tract!
11714,FRY,He's so proud of his awful cooking. If we don't eat it he'll be crushed.
11715,LEELA,"Alright don't panic. If we can get to the ship, we can fly north and hide under the polar icecaps for a few weeks."
11716,FRY,Hurry!
11717,FARNSWORTH,Good idea!
11718,ZOIDBERG,What's the hold-up?
11719,BENDER,Fleeing somewhere?
11720,FRY,"Uh, with you blocking the only escape route? Don't be silly!"
11721,BENDER,"In that case brunch is served! Let's go, move it out, stop crying Leela!"
11722,FARNSWORTH,"Zoidberg, are you coming?"
11723,ZOIDBERG,Sure. Me.
11724,FARNSWORTH,Because I don't want you touching that thing.
11725,ZOIDBERG,"I know that.  Surrender your mysteries to Zoidberg!  Oh no! Professor will hit me. But if Zoidberg fixes it, then perhaps gifts!  Ow, what? Ohh!"
11726,BENDER,"Today, I've personalised each of your meals. For example, Amy, you're cute, so I baked you a pony.  Come on! Eat! I slaved all day over a filthy stove!"
11727,HERMES,This is terrible!
11728,FARNSWORTH,Good thing I secretly installed this wormhole in the table!
11729,AMY,Where does the other end come out?
11730,FARNSWORTH,You know I'm not quite sure.  Oh dear me!
11731,BENDER,The pie is ready. You guys like swarms of things right?
11732,ZOIDBERG,"Casual hello, it's me Zoidberg, act naturally.  Ow! Ouch! Get off of me! Stop!"
11733,LEELA,How interesting Dr Zoidberg. Do go on.
11734,BENDER,Hey check out the palm tree! It only gets sick when I cook brunch! How's that for a coincidence Professor? With all your precious science!
11735,FRY [FROM LOUNGE],"Man, I don't wanna hurt Bender's feelings..."
11736,FRY,...but this food actually tastes better as vomit!
11737,LEELA,It's unbearable! How much do you think it would cost to get my tongue removed?
11738,BENDER,(crying) And this time I mean it!
11739,BENDER,"Aw, who am I kidding? It was stupid of me to ever dream of becoming a chef. I don't have what it takes and nothing can change that.  Then it's settled! Elzar will teach me to cook!"
11740,ELZAR,Absolutely not.
11741,BENDER,But I watch your show. You owe me!
11742,ELZAR,"I owe you nothing! For starter's your antenna's in my crotch. Also I hate you. Finally, you can't cook for squat."
11743,BENDER,What was the first one again?
11744,ELZAR,I hate you.
11745,BENDER,I thought that was number two.
11746,ELZAR,I knocked it up a notch. Bam!
11747,ZOIDBERG,"Aw, I'll never recombobulate this ship! When the Professor finds out, he'll tear me a new cloaca!  Wait! What would the robot do?  Frame someone."
11748,FRY,What up?
11749,FRY,(singing) I'm walking on sunshine! La la la la sunshine!
11750,BENDER,(crying) It's over! My dream of being a chef is deadder than the cat I'm sitting on!
11751,HOBO,"Gus old chum, let's give a friendly welcome to this new robo."
11752,BENDER,What did you call me?
11753,GUS,A robo. You know? A robot-hobo.
11754,BENDER,"Oh OK I thought you said ""romo."""
11755,HOBO,"No offence intended my filthy friend. In fact, why not join us and ride the space rails?"
11756,GUS,Get ready. We's gonna jump off at that switching prism up ahead.
11757,HOBO,"We're going nearly the speed of light so uh, roll when you land."
11758,BENDER,Ow.
11759,GUS,"Welcome to Bumbase Alpha, the biggest hobo jungle in the quadrant."
11760,BENDER,I've seen bigger. Oh wait I'm thinking of Eugene Oregon.  Wait. A pie with hobo-lifting aroma? Who baked it?
11761,GUS,Helmut Spargle. He used to be the greatest chef.
11762,HOBO,"His restaurant was so high toned, the only way to get reservations was to create a parallel universe where you already had reservations."
11763,GUS,Yep. I once ate there back when I what was a senator.
11764,BENDER,"Yo Spargle, if you're such a great cook, how'd you end up in this dump?"
11765,SPARGLE,Ages ago I was the host of a TV show...
11766,SPARGLE,(voice-over) ...Down Home Country Kitchen Mit Helmut Spargle. But one day the extreme soda company that sponsored the show decided it was too old fashioned.
11767,MAN,"Spargle, you're fired! We need a chef who can attract today's younger extreme cooking show viewer."
11768,SPARGLE,Elzar!
11769,ELZAR,Get lost old man! Bam!
11770,SPARGLE,Mein soufflé!
11771,SPARGLE,"Elzar had been seduced by the dark side of cooking. Cilantro, mango slasa, raspberry vinaigrette!"
11772,BENDER,That twizzler!
11773,SPARGLE,"As for me, I went temporarily insane and vound up here - making pies out of shoes."
11774,BENDER,My story's a lot like yours only more interesting 'cause it involves robots. That jerk Elzar ruined my dream of being a chef too.
11775,SPARGLE,"Interesting. You wish to become a cook, but as a robot you have no sense of taste."
11776,BENDER,"It's so unfair! I have eight other senses but I'd trade them all, even smission, to be able to taste."
11777,SPARGLE,"You don't understand. Without the distraction of taste, your mind is free to touch the Zen of pure flavour. You could become the greatest chef ever."
11778,BENDER,I could?
11779,SPARGLE,Yes. Just as Beethoven was a great composer because he was deaf!
11780,BENDER,Or like how Rembrandt was blind and had wooden hands!
11781,SPARGLE,"Bender, hear me well, I shall train you. But first you must forget everything you know about cooking."
11782,BENDER,Done.
11783,FARNSWORTH,"That's right Ricardo, a ship in a bottle...! What's that...? Well hang on, I'll look."
11784,RICARDO [ON PHONE],Ola? Professor? Qué pasa?
11785,FARNSWORTH,I've gathered you all here in the accusing parlour because one of you is a miniature ship wrecker!
11786,ZOIDBERG,I'm acting astonished.
11787,FARNSWORTH,Certain clues suggest the culprit is none other than our own...Philip J. Fry!
11788,FRY,What?!
11789,FARNSWORTH,Oh it was a brilliant scheme but you made one fatal mistake...leaving this confession note.
11790,ZOIDBERG,Fry you scoundrel!
11791,FRY,"Well, I don't remember any of that but I don't have the wherewithal to defend myself."
11792,FARNSWORTH,Then I have no choice but to charge you the full cost of the materials. $10.
11793,FRY,There you go.
11794,ZOIDBERG,(shouting) What have I done?!
11795,SPARGLE,"Your training is complete, little dessert spoon. Now, just as the man who wishes to be world chess champion must win at least one game of chess so must you serve at least one edible meal. (whispering) Succeed and I shall reveal to you the age old secret (whispering more) of perfect flavour."
11796,GUS,Ooh yeah!
11797,BENDER,Slop's on!
11798,GUS,Fine lookin' eats!
11799,SPARGLE,It is...acceptable.
11800,BENDER,Yahoo! Another thing I'm great at! Wait. Why'd you stop eating master?
11801,SPARGLE,(hoarse) Because...my stomach is about to explode.
11802,BENDER,What? My dinner killed you? Oh man!
11803,SPARGLE,"(hoarse) Oh it hurts. But don't lose confidence. The important thing is that you defeat Elzar after I am gone.  And using this, you cannot fail."
11804,BENDER,A diamond vial of Mrs Dash?
11805,SPARGLE,"(hoarse) No, it is the essence of pure flavour. A few drops will cause the inner perfection of any dinner to blossom forth.  Oh! There goes my...life."
11806,BENDER,"I'll avenge you master. I swear, in the presence of these drunken bums, that I shall defeat Elzar!"
11807,GUS,"Oh I'm not drunk, I'm mentally ill! But I like what what you said!"
11808,BENDER,"Elzar, I'm a walking pile of your unfinished business!"
11809,ELZAR,Why you -
11810,BENDER,"Helmut Spargle has a message for you. He says (hoarse) ""Ooo, I'm dead!"""
11811,ELZAR,"Spargle huh? What he do, bland himself to death?"
11812,BENDER,No. He was eating some food I made and by a crazy coincidence his stomach exploded. Now I'm here to avenge him.
11813,ELZAR,OK but it seems like you're the one who killed him.
11814,BENDER,Maybe so but you are his sworn enemy. I challenge you to a battle of the chefs.
11815,CUSTOMER,Scandalous!
11816,ELZAR,Very well. We'll meet on the ancient televised battleground of Kitchen Coliseum! Whosever meal is best will claim the title of Iron Cook.
11817,BENDER,"Iron Cook eh? I can't lose. I'm 30% iron!  You're going down! Uh, also I had a reservation for one, under ""Dr Bender."""
11818,HIROKI,Please welcome the superintendant of Kitchen Coliseum...Chairman Koji!  No robot chef has ever competed here but today one has barged his way in to challege for the title of...
11819,KOJI,...Iron Cookuru!
11820,FRY,(shouting) Yeah you show 'em!
11821,HIROKI,"Let's meet today's celebrity judges: Captain of the Harlem Globetrotters, Ethan Bubblegum Tate!"
11822,TATE,Konnichiwa brother!
11823,HIROKI,TV anchor-monster Morbo!
11824,MORBO,Greetings pathetic host!
11825,HIROKI,"And a woman who ended a thousand year war with her apple dandies, Martha Stewart's head!"
11826,STEWART,The secret is fresh pork.
11827,HIROKI,"And now, chairman Koji will present the theme ingredient to be used in every dish today."
11828,BENDER,(quietly) If it's chicken: chicken à la king. If it's fish: fish à la king. If it's turkey: fish à la king!
11829,KOJI,Soylent Greuu!
11830,HIROKI,"Soylent Green, a classic ingredient of gourment cooking. And the battle is on.  Aki, what's Elzar making?"
11831,AKI,"Well Hiroki-san, when I asked him he asked what business it was of mine and conjectured that my mother was a prostitute."
11832,STEWART,In the English countryside many prostitutes decorate their rooms with festive gourds.
11833,FEMALE ANNOUNCER,30 minutes to go.
11834,HIROKI,Look at Bender roll that dough!
11835,TATE,"I've never seen such confident, powerful strokes of the ass!"
11836,STEWART,You've never seen mine!
11837,TATE,(sexfully) No I haven't!
11838,FEMALE ANNOUNCER,Fifteen minutes remaining.
11839,HIROKI,"The iron cook is bringing in his signature creation, a working pastry replica of downtown Venice.]"
11840,MAN,"Commemorative turkey basters, get your commemorative turkey basters."
11841,FRY,"Yo, hook me up. My turkey is dry and I've tried everything.  Oh right. Never mind."
11842,ZOIDBERG,Oh the guilt! The unbearable guilt!
11843,FEMALE ANNOUNCER,Fifteen seconds.
11844,ELZAR,Bam!
11845,FEMALE ANNOUNCER,Ten seconds.
11846,BENDER,"Master Spargle. If you can hear me up there in that ditch where I left you, this is for you."
11847,KOJI,"Time, uperuu!"
11848,HIROKI,The iron cook Neptunian has gone all out to please the judges. He's even garnished the salad with $100 bills. Let's see what they think.
11849,TATE,"Mmm, soylent green is my kind of people!"
11850,MORBO,Scrumptious. Morbo will store this in his sack for future digestion.
11851,STEWART,I'm swimming in my own soylent waste. It's a good thing.
11852,HIROKI,"Next, up, challenger Bender. A student of the legendary Hemut Spargle, Bender is some sort of wonderful mechanical man."
11853,STEWART,Ooo...delicious!
11854,TATE,"This food looks kind of funky, but it tastes kind of funkay!"
11855,MORBO,The challenger's ugly food has shown us that even hideous things can be sweet on the inside.
11856,HIROKI,"And now, judgement. The winner will become the new iron cook, the loser is doomed to scrub.  Who's confection achieves perfection? Who's foodstuff will be the good stuff?"
11857,KOJI,Challengeruu Benderuu!
11858,FRY,Yay!
11859,FARNSWORTH,That's my robot! I own him!
11860,BENDER,You honour me chairman Koji.
11861,KOJI,"Domo arigato, Mr Roboto."
11862,BENDER,"Chairman-san, I came here with one goal. To humiliate Elzar in a large stadium. I believe I'e done that."
11863,ELZAR,No question.
11864,BENDER,"But the true Zen of flavour is not found in a coliseum. It is found in a small kitchen, with friends. That is why I decline the title of Iron Cook and accept only the lesser title of Zinc Saucier which I just made up. Also it comes with double prize money."
11865,ZOIDBERG,"Wait! Everyone must know. I broke the Professor's bottled ship.  And what is worse, I framed my dearest friend Fry! (crying) I can never repay him his ten dollars. So I must take the only honourable path. what the killing myself.  Here I go already.  Huh?"
11866,KOJI,Oh! That sword cost 5000 dolluu!
11867,ZOIDBERG,Fry did it!
11868,BENDER,And that's how I defeated Elzar - thanks to Spargle's magic liquid.
11869,LEELA,"Yes, we were there. And we just finished watching it on TV."
11870,FARNSWORTH,"Hmm. Let me see that vial Bender.  Good Lord! According to the spectrolizer, Spargle's magic ingredient was...water. Ordinary water!"
11871,HERMES,No!
11872,FRY,"Ah, so the real gift Spargle gave you was confidence. The confidence to be your best."
11873,FARNSWORTH,"Yes, ordinary water. Laced with nothing more than a few spoonfuls of LSD."
11874,BENDER,"The important thing is, by my standards, I won fair and square. Now, who wants brunch? Cooked with plenty of...""confidence""?"
11875,LEELA,I'm in!
11876,FARNSWORTH,I do!
11877,THE END,
11878,"""WHERE NO FAN HAS GONE BEFORE""",
11879,SHATNER,"(voice-over) Shatner's log, airdate ... unknown."
11880,SHATNER,"The impossible has happened. It would take days to recount the events I have witnessed. So, settle in. It all began--"
11881,ZAPP,"Quiet, you! This court martial is now in session. The honourably sexy Zapp Brannigan residing. Bring in the accused."
11882,TAKEI,"Oh, my!"
11883,ZAPP,"Philip J. Fry, you stand accused of travelling to the forbidden planet Omega 3, a crime punishable by 12 concurrent death sentences. Do you understand the charges?"
11884,KIF,"One beep for ""yes"", two beeps for ""no""."
11885,ZAPP,"""Yes"". So noted. Do you plead guilty? Double ""yes"". Guilty! I will now carry out the punishment. Kif, my gun."
11886,LEELA,Wait! He plead not guilty.
11887,ZAPP,"Order!  Order in the court! Very well then, Mr. Fry. Please recount the events that led you to be guilty."
11888,LEELA,"The Professor said he was taking a brief nap, so we only have time for six movies."
11889,BENDER,Lets take these six Jim Carrey movies and record over them.
11890,FRY,You know what movies average out to be really good? The first six Star Trek movies!
11891,CLERK,(shouting) Everybody hit the deck!
11892,LEELA,(whispering) Sh! Those words are forbidden!
11893,FRY,What words? Star Trek?
11894,LEELA,Sh!
11895,ZOIDBERG,Shut your gills!
11896,BENDER,That sound! It's patrol car 718! Hide him!
11897,ZAPP,The court is intrigued. Perhaps we could hear more about these forbidden words from someone with a sexilly seductive voice.
11898,TAKEI,"With pleasure. You see, the show was banned after the Star Trek wars."
11899,ZAPP,You mean after the vast migration of Star Wars fans?
11900,NICHOLS,"No, that was the Star Wars trek.  By the 23rd century, Star Trek fandom had evolved from a loose association of nerds with skin problems into a full-blown religion."
11901,PRIEST,And Scotty beamed them to the Klingon ship where they would be no Tribble at all.
11902,CONGREGATION,All power to the engines.
11903,NICHOLS,"As country after country fell under its influence, world leaders became threatened by the movements power. And so the Trekkies were executed in the manner most befitting virgins."
11904,MAN,"He's dead, Jim!  He's dead, Jim!  He's dead, Jim!"
11905,NICHOLS,"Finally, the sacred texts were banned."
11906,TAKEI,The last copies of the 79 episodes and six movies were dumped on the forbidden world Omega 3. Along with that blooper reel where the door doesn't close all the way.
11907,NIMOY,"Thus, Star Trek was forever scoured from human memory."
11908,BENDER,Another classic science-fiction show cancelled before its time.
11909,ZAPP,I've never heard of such a brutal and shocking injustice that I cared so little about. Next witness.
11910,KIF,"Bender the robot, please take the stand."
11911,FRY,"She's all yours, buddy!"
11912,BENDER,"I'd only met the defendant, Fry, once, but I knew he was up to no good."
11913,ZAPP,Please use the beeps.
11914,FRY,"Mr. Nimoy, I came as soon as I heard what happened centuries ago. I can't believe your show was banned."
11915,NIMOY,I have absolutely no idea what you're talking about.
11916,FRY,"You know? 1966? 79 episodes, about 30 good ones."
11917,NIMOY,"Oh, really, I've done too many things to remember one particular TV series. But if-if you want to discuss my books of poetry--"
11918,FRY,Come on! Remember that episode where you go high on spores and smacked Kirk around?
11919,NIMOY,"No. Perhaps you're thinking of my one man show about Vincent van Spock-- Uh, uh, I mean van Gogh! Damn!"
11920,FRY,Aha! You can't escape it!
11921,NIMOY,"(crying) Oh, you're right, I can't."
11922,FRY,"Uh, jeez, don't get upset. I mean, OK I outwitted you, but--"
11923,NIMOY,"(crying) No, it's my fellow cast members. 300 years ago they left Earth behind."
11924,SHATNER,"This planet doesn't appreciate us anymore, Leonard."
11925,NIMOY,"Bill, you are, and always shall be, my friend. But I just signed a six-month lease on my apartment. I can't walk away from a commitment like that."
11926,SHATNER,"Very well, my friend."
11927,NIMOY,(crying) Why did the world turn its back on our obvious greatness?
11928,FRY,I'm literally angry with rage! Your co-stars may be gone but we can still get those episode tapes back for the whole world to see. Come on!
11929,NIMOY,Oh!
11930,FRAKES,Yes! Front row!
11931,LEELA,You can't go to Omega 3; It's forbidden! I forbid you!
11932,FRY,But we have to! The world needs Star Trek to give people hope for the future.
11933,LEELA,But it's set 800 years in the past!
11934,BENDER,"Yeah, why is this so important to you?"
11935,FRY,"'Cause it-it taught me so much. Like how you should accept people, whether they be black, white, Klingon or even female. But most importantly, when I didn't have any friends, it made me feel like maybe I did."
11936,LEELA,"Well, that is touchingly pathetic. I guess I can't let you go alone."
11937,BENDER,"I'll go too, with Leonard's permission, of course."
11938,LEELA,We're entering the Omega system.
11939,COMPUTER VOICE,Warning: You are now in forbidden space.
11940,BENDER,"Forbidden shmer-shmidden! What are they gonna do, write a letter? (sarcastic) Ooh, I'm so scared!"
11941,LEELA,I've lost control of the ship!
11942,FRY,"Oh, dip!"
11943,NIMOY,"Dip, indeed!"
11944,FRY,It's all stuff from that forbidden show.
11945,NIMOY,"So many cardboard sets, so many memories. If only the others--"
11946,SHATNER,I guess that's my cue.
11947,NIMOY,Bill!
11948,SHATNER,L-Dog!
11949,NIMOY,(laughing) Hey! This is wonderful!
11950,SHATNER,"Oh, man."
11951,NIMOY,I feel like hugging you.
11952,SHATNER,Well I would except you have no body! And we're both men.
11953,NIMOY,Nichelle! George! Walter! DeForest! Welshy!
11954,FRY,Welshy?
11955,NICHOLS,We did some musical reunion specials in the 2200's but the guy who played Scotty had trouble yodelling.
11956,TAKEI,"Ever since then, Welshy has been a welcome participant in our escapades."
11957,FRY,I can't believe it! How'd you all end up here?
11958,SHATNER,"We were on our way to Welshy's cousin's house to stay in the guest room when our ship was pulled down to this planet and crashed, just like yours."
11959,KOENIG,"When we woke up, we had these bodies."
11960,FRY,Say it in Russian!
11961,KOENIG,Ven ve voke up ve had these wodies.
11962,FRY,"Now say ""nuclear wessels""!"
11963,KOENIG,No!
11964,TAKEI,You'll love it here. Everything is provided for us. And we never age. Check out these abs!
11965,BENDER,Yowza!
11966,LEELA,But who's doing all this for you?
11967,SHATNER,"You know, we never thought about it. We're famous celebrities -- we're used to this sort of treatment."
11968,MELLLVAR,It is I!
11969,BENDER,Whoa! What a cheesy effect!
11970,MELLLVAR,I am not an effect! You doubt my power?
11971,BENDER,I do.
11972,WELSHY,(shouting) Aye!
11973,FRY,(screaming) Welshy!
11974,ZAPP,"This court will now hear some very sensual testimony from this court's ex-lover, Turanga Leela."
11975,LEELA,Go  yourself.
11976,MELLLVAR,"Behold another power, different from the one you saw earlier."
11977,NIMOY,"Hey! A body! Buff, tan. Yeah, this is mine alright!"
11978,FRY,"Alright, you gas, what's the deal?"
11979,MELLLVAR,"Centuries ago, the videotaped adventures of the Enterprise crew rained down upon my planet. Over and over, I watched them. Especially the five with the energy beings. I am Melllvar! Seer of the tapes, knower of the episodes! Tremble before my encyclopaedic knowledge of Star Trek!"
11980,FRY,Tremble? I laugh. Nobody knows more about Star Trek than me!
11981,MELLLVAR,"I beg to differ.  Long have I waited for the one who played Spock. At last, we can begin."
11982,FRY,Cool! A Star Trek convention!
11983,NIMOY,"Uh, Melllvar, can you give us some idea of how long this is going to last?"
11984,MELLLVAR,Until time stops.
11985,LEELA,What?
11986,SHATNER,He can't do this!
11987,NIMOY,You can't be serious!
11988,MELLLVAR,"Now, we have a full schedule of events--"
11989,BENDER,"Uh, can people who hate Star Trek leave?"
11990,KOENIG,Good question!
11991,MELLLVAR,"No, you have to stay even longer."
11992,MELLLVAR,"Um, uh, sign it to Melllvar. ""Melllvar"" has three ""L's""."
11993,TAKEI,"I think I've done enough conventions to know how to spell ""Melllvar""."
11994,BENDER,"Say ""nerd""!"
11995,ALL,Nerd!
11996,SHATNER,"(spoken-word) I'm Slim Shady,"
11997,KOENIG,How can you do a spoken-word version of a rap song?
11998,MELLLVAR,He found a way.
11999,LEELA,For one hundred quatloos: Who did the captain maroon on Ceti Alpha V?
12000,SHATNER (SHOUTING),Khaaan!
12001,FRY,Uh ... Khan?
12002,LEELA,Correct.
12003,MELLLVAR,"My button has broken. The trivia contest has ended. I-I now have a surprise. You will perform a fan script, written by the ultimate Trek fan."
12004,FRY,You have my fan script?
12005,MELLLVAR,I meant me! Melllvar is the ultimate fan!
12006,FRY,"(smug) Oh, I was confused because the scoreboard says something different."
12007,MELLLVAR,"Trivia contest over! Take your scripts! We have limited rehearsal time. Now, I didn't make enough copies of the script so George and Walter will have to share."
12008,LEELA,"Uh, you probably don't want us to see you rehearsing, or it'll give away the ending."
12009,MELLLVAR,That's right! The ending must not be ruined.
12010,LEELA,We'll go wait in the ship.
12011,MELLLVAR,
12012,FRY,Not 'til I get my 600 quatloos!
12013,FRY,This is wrong. We shouldn't have abandoned them there.
12014,BENDER,"I dunno, I'm feeling pretty good about it."
12015,LEELA,"I didn't wanna leave them either, Fry, but what are we supposed to do?"
12016,FRY,"Well, usually on the show someone would come up with a complicated plan then explain it with a simple analogy."
12017,LEELA,"Hmm. If we can re-route engine power through the primary weapons and reconfigure them to Melllvar's frequency, that should overload his electro-quantum structure."
12018,BENDER,Like putting too much air in a balloon!
12019,FRY,Of course! It's so simple!
12020,SHATNER,"(reading) Alas, my ship, whom I love like a woman, is .. .disabled.  Oh, Lord!"
12021,NIMOY,"(reading) Fascinating, captain, and logical too. Yet we need some help."
12022,TAKEI,"(reading) Look, captain, Melllvar will help us."
12023,KOENIG,"(reading) Keptin, I wope he will welp our ... vessel."
12024,MELLLVAR,Wessel!  You're not acting hard enough!
12025,NIMOY,"Melllvar, you have to respect your actors. When I directed Star Trek IV I got a magnificent performance out of Bill because I respected him so much."
12026,SHATNER,"And when I directed Star Trek V I got a magnificent performance out of me, because I respected me so much!"
12027,BENDER,"(shouting) OK! I'm done re-kafoobling the energy motron ... or, whatever."
12028,LEELA,Fire!
12029,NICHOLS,"(reading) My, what a handsome energy creature you are. I love you.  Hey, you wrote it!"
12030,LEELA,Its not working! He's drawing straight from our weapons.
12031,FRY,Like a balloon and ... something bad happens.
12032,BENDER,Yup!
12033,LEELA,"So, uh, how's rehearsal going?"
12034,MELLLVAR,"Lousy. Here I've been admiring a bunch of actors while you, a crew of genuine space heroes, risked your lives to save them."
12035,NIMOY,Hey! We've done heroic things too.
12036,NICHOLS,Yeah! In the third season I kissed Shatner!
12037,MELLLVAR,Silence! My whole world has turned upside-down. I have but one option.
12038,KOENIG,Keep them and let us go?
12039,MELLLVAR,No! To determine who is more worthy of my fanatical devotion I shall pit you together against each other in armed combat ... To the death!
12040,BENDER,Where'd you get an idiotic idea like that?
12041,MELLLVAR,"Episodes 19, 46, 56 and 77."
12042,FRY,"Great list. Except, you forgot episode 66!"
12043,MELLLVAR,I was getting to that one!
12044,ZAPP,So Melllvar ordered a battle to the death. I assume no one survived.
12045,LEELA,Can we get on with this? My foot's getting tired!
12046,MELLLVAR,"This will be your standard battle to the death. The only weapons: Whatever you can find. But I warn you, do nothing until I have signalled the start of combat. OK, start."
12047,KOENIG,I don't have much experience at fighting-- Except with you guys.
12048,SHATNER,I have an idea. Wasn't there an episode where I threw my shoe at the enemy?
12049,NIMOY,You mean Doohan?
12050,SHATNER,"Whoever it was, I did it like this."
12051,TAKEI,Ow!
12052,SHATNER,My foot's cold!
12053,LEELA,"There, we can make these into spears."
12054,FRY,And we can tie these caterpillars together to make bow strings for bows and arrows.
12055,BENDER,And we can use this machine gun to shoot them! Yee-haw!  That was fun!
12056,NICHOLS,What if I distract them with my famous fan dance?
12057,SHATNER,"Oh, that's good, good, good, good. And then, George, you give them a karate chop!"
12058,TAKEI,I find that offensive. Just because I'm of Japanese ancestry you assume I know karate. Have I ever led you to believe I've studied karate?
12059,SHATNER,"Well, no, but you never talk about yourself."
12060,TAKEI,(sadly) Maybe if you showed a little interest.
12061,FRY,"Well, here goes nothing."
12062,NICHOLS,"(sexfully) Hello, boys!"
12063,BENDER,Whoa!
12064,TAKEI,Hi-yah!
12065,SHATNER,There's no right way to hit a woman.
12066,LEELA,Then do it the wrong way.
12067,SHATNER,Fine. Yah!
12068,LEELA,Is that all you've got? Hi-yah!
12069,SHATNER,See you in h--
12070,BENDER,"Come on, Walter!"
12071,NIMOY,Take that!
12072,FRY,It hurts!
12073,NIMOY,Let's see if this actually works!  Hm. Ow! Ow! Ow!
12074,KOENIG,My face!
12075,TAKEI,Ow! My face too!
12076,SHATNER,May I?  Oh!
12077,MELLLVAR,Excellent! Excellent!
12078,SHATNER,"Leela, please. This is exactly what Melllvar wants. We're just pawns in his diabolical game of checkers. Can't we resolve our differences some other way?"
12079,MELLLVAR'S MOTHER,Melllvar! Dinner time!
12080,MELLLVAR,"Aw, but Mom, I'm playing with my collectables!"
12081,MELLLVAR'S MOTHER,Now!
12082,FRY,"All this time we thought he was a powerful super-being, yet he was just a child."
12083,MELLLVARS'S MOTHER,"He's not a child, he's 34!"
12084,BENDER,"Alright, Koenig, I've wanted to do this for years!"
12085,FRY,"Bender, wait! This is our chance to escape, before Melllvar comes back. But we all need to work together."
12086,SHATNER,I love you so much!
12087,NIMOY,Hello?
12088,FRY,We've decided to work together.
12089,NIMOY,"Uh, so did they."
12090,SHATNER,"Now, how do we escape?"
12091,LEELA,We can't use our ship; We have life support but the engines are wrecked.
12092,TAKEI,Ironic Because our engines work but our life support systems don't.
12093,LEELA,"Hey, if your engines work--"
12094,TAKEI,And your life support systems work--
12095,FRY,"Stop! You're just goin' around in circles! (to himself) Think, Fry, think! Everyone's depending on you."
12096,LEELA,"We're too heavy. You guys need to lose some weight, fast!"
12097,FRY,"Look, Leonard, we're light enough to keep the tapes! Isn't that great?"
12098,NIMOY,I'm living in a gefilte fish jar.
12099,FRY,We did it!
12100,FRY,Melllvar's got a spaceship!
12101,MELLLVAR,"Yes, in mint condition. And you made me take it out of the package!"
12102,LEELA,The Nimbus! We're saved!
12103,ZAPP,You're under arrest. Prepare to be boarded.
12104,ZAPP,"So I boarded you, eh. What happened next?"
12105,LEELA,"You started this stupid court martial. Now if you don't mind, we're still fighting Melllvar!"
12106,LEELA,One more hit and we're done for!
12107,TAKEI,"Let's take 'em out with us. Do you guys have a self-destruct code? Like ""destruct sequence 1-A, 2-B, 3--"""
12108,BENDER,"Thanks a lot, Takei, now everybody knows!"
12109,MELLLVAR,"If I can't have the original cast of Star Trek, no one will! Prepare to die!"
12110,FRY,"Wait! If they mean that much to you, why do you wanna kill them?"
12111,MELLLVAR,Because I ... I ... I dunno what I'd do without them.
12112,FRY,"Melllvar, you can't let a TV show be your whole life. You can do anything you want. Look at Walter Koenig: After Star Trek, he became an actor."
12113,KOENIG,"Not just an actor, but a well-rounded person, with my own friends and credit cards and keys."
12114,MELLLVAR,"Well, I guess I could move out of my parents' basement ... maybe get a temp job."
12115,FRY,"Whoa, whoa! One step at a time."
12116,MELLLVAR,"I thank you, Fry. You know, you and I are of a kind. In a different reality I could have called you ""friend""."
12117,FRY,"Episode 10, Balance Of Terror."
12118,MELLLVAR,"More like episode nine, loser! In your face! Victory is mine!"
12119,SHATNER,"I wonder, my friends, was he really such an evil energy gas?"
12120,NICHOLS,He did give us eternal youth.
12121,KOENIG,24-hour Laundromat.
12122,TAKEI,"A full assortment of rum, both spiced and regular."
12123,NIMOY,"Truly, it was a paradise."
12124,FRY,And all you had to put up with was one really annoying Star Trek fan.
12125,SHATNER,Let's get the hell outta here!
12126,FUTURAMA,
12127,"""CRIMES OF THE HOT""",
12128,ZOIDBERG,"Hurry up with the water, I'm steaming in my own shell I am, it's that hot it is!"
12129,LEELA,Heyya!
12130,FRY,Man it's hot! (different voice.) How hot is it? (normal voice.) It's so hot I poured McDonalds Coffee in my lap to cool off.  Jonny Carson said it.
12131,LEELA,"No! Nibbler, don't drink the pool water! It's full of chlorine!"
12132,BENDER,Lightweights! Oh wait - chlorine!
12133,FARNSWORTH,Perhaps this movie will help us take our minds off the heat.
12134,BENDER (JITTERY),Focuuus!
12135,NARRATOR [IN MOVIE],"You're probably wondering why your ice cream went away. Well Suzie, the culprit isn't foreigners, it's global warming!"
12136,SUZIE [IN MOVIE],Gwobal wappa?
12137,MAN [IN MOVIE.],"Uh, yeah! Meet Mr Sunbeam. He comes all the way from the sun to visit Earth."
12138,GAS [IN MOVIE],Not so fast Sunbeam! We're Greenhouse Gases! You ain't going nowhere!
12139,MAN [IN MOVIE],Pretty soon Earth is chock full of sunbeams......their rotting corpses heating our atmosphere.
12140,SUZIE [IN MOVIE],How do we get wid of the gweenhouse grasses?
12141,NARRATOR [IN MOVIE],"Fortunately our handsomest politicians came up with a cheap, last minute way to combat global warming. Ever since 2063 we drop a giant ice cube into the ocean every now and then."
12142,SUZIE [IN MOVIE],Just like Daddy puts in his drink every morning! (sadly) And then he gets mad.
12143,NARRATOR [IN MOVIE],"Of course, since the greenhouse gases are still building up, it takes more and more ice each time.  Thus solving the problem once and for all."
12144,SUZIE [IN MOVIE],But...
12145,LEELA,"Well, we just need one of those big ice cubes. Someone should call the losers who are supposed to deliver it.  Hello?"
12146,NIXON [ON SCREEN],President Nixon here.  I'm hiring you losers to deliver the ice. And hurry up! I'm sweating like J. Edgar Hoover trying to squeeze into a new girdle!
12147,FARNSWORTH,"You heard the good news everyone! Save the Earth, et cetera et cetera!  Bye!"
12148,FRY,Wait! Where do we get the ice?
12149,FARNSWORTH,The wha? Oh Halley's Comet of course. The only sufficient source of ice cubes that don't have bugs in them!
12150,FRY,"Wow! Mining a comet, that sounds fun!"
12151,FARNSWORTH,Yes there's no safer occupation than mining. Especially when you're on a snowball whipping through space at a million miles an hour!  Safe!
12152,BENDER,Deploying ice drill.
12153,FRY,"Wow! That ice dispenser's so big, the ice crushes you!  Yakov Smirnov said it!"
12154,LEELA,No he didn't.
12155,BENDER,Activating ice drill.
12156,FRY,Oh my God! It's out of ice! Like some outer space Motel 6!
12157,LEELA,Completely out of ice?
12158,BENDER,This could mean the end of the bana daquiri as we know it...also life.
12159,LINDA [ON TV],"With Halley's Comet out of ice, Earth is experiencing the devastating effects of sudden intense global warming."
12160,MORBO [ON TV],Morbo is pleased but sticky. The scorching heat has melted the polar ice caps causing floods of biblical proportions.
12161,GAY SAILOR [ON TV],They called me crazy for building this ark.
12162,MAN [ON TV],"You are crazy, you built it with same sex animal couples!"
12163,GAY SAILOR [ON TV],Hey! There are parts of the Bible I like and parts I don't like.
12164,MORBO [ON TV],Direct your attention now to the African turtles seen here migrating to cooler homes in Holland.
12165,BENDER (CRYING),That poor turtle!
12166,FRY,Bender? Are you crying?
12167,BENDER (CRYING),Uh no! Never!
12168,MORBO [ON TV],Morbo wishes these storward nomads peace among the Dutch tulips!
12169,LINDA [ON TV],I'm sure those windmills will keep them cool.
12170,BENDER,"Well everybody, I just saved a turtle, what have you done with your lives?"
12171,HERMES,You went all the way to Holland already?
12172,LEELA,Bender a turtle isn't yourself. Why do you care about it?
12173,BENDER,Because I also care deeply of things that remind me of myself. Like poor little Shelly here.
12174,HERMES,What could you possibly have in common with this walking soup mix?
12175,BENDER,"For one thing, we both have a tough outer shell.  But lead a rich, inner life. Also...well you know..."
12176,LEELA,"You're both alcoholic, whore-mongering, chain smoking gamblers?"
12177,BENDER,No! Its just...neither of us can get up when we get knocked on our back.
12178,FRY,What? I've seen you get up off your back tons of times.
12179,BENDER,Those times I was slightly on my side.
12180,HERMES,Interesting. Maybe we should test this erectile disfunction of yours Bender.
12181,BENDER,"Uh, that's not necessary, really! I think I hear my factory recalling me."
12182,BENDER,Oh! That's what I get for sharing my vulnerability with you people.
12183,VAN,"Calling all scientists, calling all scientists. Be advised there will be a worldwide conference on global warming in Kyoto, Japan."
12184,MAN,I've got a degree in homeopathic medicine!
12185,VAN,You've got a degree in baloney!
12186,AMY,"Professor Farnsworth, you're a scientist!"
12187,FARNSWORTH,"Forget it, I'm not going! I have my reasons! Shut up all of you!"
12188,HERMES,"Strange. You haven't acted suspicious since I found those ""ape bones"" in the basement."
12189,FARNSWORTH,My hip hurts! I'm in the middle of cooking a turkey! I have warranty cards to fill out! I'm not just making excuses! Alright I'll go!
12190,CROWD,Oh God I can't believe it! I love you!
12191,RIVERS,Oh oh! It's Hubert Farnsworth! He's looking fab in a standard white lab coat and dark slacks! His wristwatch is Casio.
12192,VAN,"Thank you all for coming! It is my pleasure to introduce the host of the Kyoto Global Warming Convention, the inventor of the environment and First Emperor of the Moon - Al Gore!"
12193,GORE,I have ridden the mighty Moon Worm.
12194,FRY,Good for him!
12195,GORE,"My fellow Earthicans, as I discuss in my book, Earth In The Balance and the much more popular Harry Potter And The Balance Of Earth we need to defend our planet against pollution. As well as dark wizards."
12196,DARK WIZARD,Sure! Blame the wizards!
12197,GORE,That's why I'm offering a bag of Moon Saphires to the scientist who can solve this problem once and for all.  Lovely aren't they?
12198,DARK WIZARD,Sapphires?  With those I could open the Gate Of Kerash!
12199,GORE,First up is Professor Ogden Wernstrom.
12200,FARNSWORTH,Wernstrom!
12201,WERNSTROM,Ahem. Ladies and Gentlemen. I have placed in orbit a giant mirror that will reflect 40% of the sun's rays. Thus cooling Earth. Observe.
12202,WERNSTROM,Problem solved.
12203,MAN,"Ooo, that's a little bright."
12204,GORE,"Alright, What else we got?"
12205,FRY,"Professor, you're a Professor. You must have some ideas."
12206,FARNSWORTH,Absolutely not! I won't speak! I've got nothing to hide!
12207,GORE,Our next speaker is -
12208,FARNSWORTH,I demand the floor!
12209,GORE,"Yes, it's your turn to speak."
12210,FARNSWORTH,"Well nuts to me. I'm taking the stage! I know the source of the greenhouse gases. But in my shame I've kept it secret for 75 long years. Ohhh, it haunts my memory still."
12211,FRY,"Professor no, don't do it!"
12212,FARNSWORTH,Don't do what? Don't use this memory ray so I can remember what happened back then?
12213,PROTOTYPE,Oh dear. Might I favour master with a tender kiss on the forehead?
12214,FARNSWORTH,"Oh dear, I've failed again."
12215,PROTOTYPE,"Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear."
12216,FARNSWORTH,"Ooo, ouch, stop!"
12217,MOM,What was that?
12218,FARNSWORTH,A flaming burp.
12219,MOM,Does it always do that?
12220,FARNSWORTH,Its not always a burp. We still have one problem though. This robot will never meet emission standards.
12221,MOM,Crap spackle!  We'll just call it a sport utility robot and classify it as a light truck!
12222,FARNSWORTH,Well...I suppose the environment can take one more for the team.
12223,MOM,Take me now you stud!
12224,FARNSWORTH,Oh this is all my fault!
12225,FRY,That's awful Professor. Especially the making out part.
12226,GORE,"Yeah, I didn't need to hear that."
12227,FARNSWORTH,All modern robots descend from my original smog blasting designs. And that's the cause of global warming today.
12228,WERNSTROM,"Uh, so the robots are to blame. As I suspected.  We are left with only one possible course of action. Grim though it be."
12229,BENDER,I got a good feeling about this!
12230,WERNSTROM,"We must immediately and permanently shut down, dismantle and destroy all robots!"
12231,BENDER,No!
12232,FARNSWORTH,"Wait, surely there's a better -"
12233,VAN,The conference is over.
12234,GORE,"I must go now, to help collect cans on Jupiter. Peace out ya'll!"
12235,AUDIENCE (CHANTING),Destroy all robots! Destroy all robots!
12236,AMY,Poor Bender.
12237,FRY,Be brave my friend.
12238,LEELA,Come on. You've got to come out of your chest sometime.  Would you do it for a Bender snack?
12239,FRY,Ah ha!
12240,LEELA,Gotcha!
12241,BENDER [FROM INSIDE],Let me go! I don't even want the stupid beer!  Yes! You tried to trick me into coming out of my chest. But who has the beer now?  I've got mail.
12242,AMY,"Ooo, it's a party. Apparently."
12243,NIXON [IN CARD],Do you like to party? To boogie down? Well I'm throwing an all night beach raver for my robot pals. It all goes down Saturday on the isolated Galapogas Islands where there will be no escape - from the fun! All robots must attend!
12244,ZOIDBERG,"Strange. Why would Nixon, an awkward, uncomfortabble man suddenly throw a party? One of the most social events imaginable. It's a trap is why! They're going to deactivate all the robots! I don't hear any gasping."
12245,LEELA,We all figured that out.
12246,ZOIDBERG,Ohh!
12247,BENDER,"Well, I'm off."
12248,FRY,Wait. We could hide you! We'll pile fruit on you and claim you're a bowl.
12249,BENDER,No. I'm going to the party.
12250,FRY,I won't let you.
12251,BENDER,"Fry, as you know, there are lots of things I'm willing to kill for. Jewels, vengence, Father O'Mally's weedwhacker. But at long last I've found something I'm willing to die for. This mindless turtle."
12252,FRY,"Bender, this world isn't good enough for you."
12253,BENDER,Not even close. Goodbye everybody. Don't touch my stuff after I'm dead!  (shouting) It's booby trapped.
12254,BENDER,Poor guy. Maybe you'd feel better if I had a drink.  Crummy kegg it's completely ta -  Oh you're a robot.
12255,KEGG,Don't stop!
12256,BENDER,Ew!
12257,NIXON,"Attention happenin' robots. Who's got what it takes to party with Nixon? You fellas enjoy yourselves for the next two hours. And be sure not to leave the island, uh for at least two hours! I'm going out to pick up some smokes. Uh really good smokes! Two hours.  OK headless body of Agnoo, lets blow this joint!"
12258,BENDER,"Nah, I'm not really in the -"
12259,WERNSTROM,Per your orders I have modified my mirror to fire a colossal electromagnetic pulse at the Galapogas. Every robot will be instantly and painfully terminated. Now for your part of the bargain.
12260,NIXON,"Oh, very well. Agnoo, you belong to Wernstrom now."
12261,BENDER,I have to say goodbye now. There ain't not turtles where daddy's a-going. (whispering) Don't tell anybody but Nixon's about to shut all robots off and -
12262,MIC,What??
12263,ROBOT #1 (SHOUTING),We're gonna die!
12264,ROBOT #2 (SHOUTING),Nixon's not bringing the smokes!
12265,BENDER,"Shut up and pay attention to me! Bender. Look, I love life and its pleasures as much as anyone here, except perhaps you Hedonismbot.  But we need to be shut off! Especially you Hendonismbot!"
12266,HEDONISMBOT,I apologise for nothing!
12267,BENDER,We pollute too much. We're destroying the world and killing the turtles.
12268,PREACHERBOT,To hell with the turtles!
12269,BENDER,No one insults the turtles!
12270,PREACHERBOT,Oh mercy.
12271,HEDONISMBOT,Let the games begin!
12272,FARNSWORTH,Everyone listen!
12273,PREACHERBOT,Aw damn!
12274,FARNSWORTH,I've devised a way to save you and to stop global warming at the same time! Granted you're all blasting out greenhouse gases.
12275,BENDER,You're one to talk!
12276,FARNSWORTH,"But we can use those very gases to save the planet. If you all vent your exhaust directly upward in one burst it should thrust the Earth further from the sun, thus cooling it.  By my calculations we'll need the full force of every last robot. So quickly, everyone point your exhaust vents straight upwards.  Now vent! Vent like the wind!  Harder! Harder!"
12277,FRY,Why isn't this working?!
12278,LEELA,Some lazy or polite robot is holding it in.
12279,BENDER,Help! Help!!
12280,FARNSWORTH,A billion robot lives are about to be extinguished! Oh the Jedi's are going to feel this one!
12281,BENDER,"I'm sorry buddy. At least we'll die on our backs, helpless.  Huh? What the hell are you doing?  Hey are you trying to make me look bad?  Ah ha! I'm even greater than I thought I was! And now to fullfill my destiny."
12282,NIXON,Fire!!  What the??
12283,WERNSTROM,We missed.
12284,NIXON,"Professor, for saving the Earth and foiling me, I proudly, yet angrily, present you with Earth's new highest honour: The Polluting Medal Of Pollution."
12285,FARNSWORTH,Thank you. I deserve this!
12286,BENDER,Hey Professor! Now that the Earth's orbit is further from the sun won't that make the year longer?
12287,FARNSWORTH,Why yes! One week longer to be exact.
12288,NIXON,In that case I hereby declare it Robot Party Week!
12289,THE END,
12290,"""JURASSIC BARK""",
12291,BENDER,"Ahem! For my next trick, notice I have nothing up my sleeves......and nothing in my head.  So if my lovely assistant will kindly supply me with an ordinary, non-fake pitcher of milk......behold the milk has vanished! Exiled, perhaps, to another dimension!"
12292,FRY,"Amazing! That's why they call you ""Bender The Magnificent""!"
12293,BENDER,No it isn't!
12294,FRY,"Whoa! They discovered an intact, 20th Century pizzeria! Just like the one I used to work at!"
12295,BENDER,Interesting. No wait the other thing - tedious!
12296,FRY,Lets go check it out. You can see how I lived before I met you.
12297,BENDER,You lived before you met me?
12298,FRY,Sure. Lots of people did.
12299,BENDER,Really?
12300,BENDER,"Truly, they were as Gods who build this place!"
12301,TOUR GUIDE,"Next, we come to the splendidly preserved wooden pizza paddle.  Scientists theorise it was used to gently discipline the delivery boy."
12302,FRY,"Wait a second! This is Panucci's! I used to work in this exact pizzeria! And for your information lady, this was not just used to paddle my butt, it was also used to move pizzas and crush rats."
12303,TOUR GUIDE,I don't know where you get your facts sir but I am a volunteer housewife with 45 minutes of orientation and a harlequin romance about archeologists!
12304,FRY,"Don't wave your fancy degrees at me. I recognise all this stuff.  Petrified sausages, Old Mr Patelli, and that's -"
12305,VOICE [ON BUZZER.],Yes?
12306,FRY,Pizza delivery for Mr......Seymour Asses.
12307,VOICE [ON BUZZER.],There's no one by that name here...or anywhere. I hope that in time you'll realise what an idiot you've been.
12308,FRY,I wouldn't count on it.
12309,FRY,"Aww. Poor little guy. You look like you haven't eaten in a month. Here......but if Mr Panucci asks, your name is Seynour Asses!  I like you Seymour, you're not constantly judging me like all the other dogs - are you? Nah. We understand each other.  People think you're a dumb mutt who smells bad, can't find a girlfriend and has a crummy job. But you're keepin' it real and call no man ""Mister.""  Well goodbye.  Live long and prosper."
12310,BENDER,Yuck! That's the least appetising calzone I've ever seen!
12311,FRY,No! That's my dog in there! It's an outrage I say!
12312,BENDER,Ow ow ow!
12313,FRY,I'm taking him home and I'd like to see anyone try and stop me.  Uh-oh!
12314,FRY,"Ow, oo ow, oo ah!"
12315,BENDER,"...And then he was ejected by the guards. Needless to say, I was mortified."
12316,FRY,Well it's not right to make my dead pet an exhibit. That's like digging up Lassie and putting her on display in the Louvre.
12317,AMY,Lassie is on display in the Louvre.
12318,FRY,"I know, I was deliberately describing a similar situation."
12319,FARNSWORTH,Why don't you try protesting? Like those native Martians. Always whining that people don't treat their ancestor's bones with respect.
12320,BENDER,"Nah, protesting never works."
12321,FRY,You're right.  I'll give it a shot!
12322,CROWD (CHANTING),What do you want?
12323,CROWD,(chanting) When do you want it?
12324,CROWD,Yaaay!
12325,LEELA,It says this part of The Hustle implores the Gods to grant a favour. Usually a Trans-AM.
12326,FRY (SINGING),I'm walking on sunshine! Ooo-oo-ooh! I'm walking on sunshine! Ooo-oo-ooh! At a boy Seymour! Right here waiting for me as always! Just like that huge mushroom in my shower!
12327,PANUCCI,"Hey there's our little mascot!  Aww you been swimming in the sewer again? You little rascal!  Fry, cleanup!"
12328,FRY,"Seymour, cleanup!  Good dog!"
12329,PANUCCI,That's a good Seymour!
12330,BOY,Yo! There's dog fur on my slice!
12331,PANUCCI,"Nah, that's vermicelli! No fur in here!"
12332,FRY,He's so cute! He can do two things at one time: Eat and swim. Ooo - three things.
12333,LEELA,"Fry, its been three days. You can't keep boogie-ing like this. You'll come down with a fever of some sort."
12334,BEELER,"Mr. Fry? I'm Dr Ben Beeler, the paleontologist who discovered your dog, or as some call it, the Beeler-saurus."
12335,FRY,So do I get Seymour back? Are you caving to political pressure?
12336,BEELER,No we're sorry but there's just too much that fossil can teach us about dogs from your time.
12337,FRY,"His name was Seymour. He was once intimate with the leg of a wandering saxaphonist. He had wet dog smell, even when dry. And he was not above chasing the number 29 bus."
12338,RAY,The 29? Interesting.
12339,BEELER,"That's all I needed, Ray?"
12340,RAY,I'm good.
12341,BEELER,"OK then, here's your dog back."
12342,FRY,Seymour!
12343,BENDER,Lady and Gentleman! How 'bout a hand for my temporary replacement assistant?
12344,ZOIDBERG,I was all in this part! Its magic!
12345,BENDER,You are not fit to wear Fry's leotard!
12346,ZOIDBERG,Stop!
12347,FRY,Good news everyone!
12348,BENDER,"Hooray, he's back! He's looking for a garbage can to put that dog in! Here you go buddy!"
12349,FARNSWORTH,"No, actually we've discovered Fry's dog was fast-fossilised, preserving it's cellular structure!"
12350,FRY,Which means...we can clone it! Seymour will live again!
12351,ZOIDBERG,A little land mammal!
12352,FRY,Can you believe it Bender? I'm going to have my best friend back!
12353,CUBERT,Why the idiot convention?
12354,FARNSWORTH,"Ah Cubert, my precious babe. I'm going to attempt to clone Fry's dog. Using the very same apparatus I used to clone you!  Ooo look, there's a smidge of toe still in here.  You see, beneath the fossil's crunchy, mineral shell, there's still a creamy core of dog nougat!"
12355,FRY,So will Seymour remember how to sing Walking On Sunshine?
12356,FARNSWORTH,"Amazingly yes. In cases of rapid fossilisation, I can press this brain scan button, retrieving Seymour's memories at the precise instant of doggy death!"
12357,FRY,"I'm gonna get my puppy back! In your face, Grim Reaper!"
12358,BENDER,Crappy ineffective Reaper!
12359,FARNSWORTH,I just need to reset the Clone-O-Mat from Human Mode to Dog Mode.
12360,WOMAN'S VOICE,The dog says
12361,FARNSWORTH,"Uh-oh, this may take a while."
12362,KID,You stink loser!
12363,PANUCCI,"Hey, Fry. Pizza goin' out. C'mon!"
12364,FRY,But I'm celebrating New Years Eve.
12365,PANUCCI,Like you got squat to celebrate! You're a delivery boy this millenium and you'll be a delivery boy next millenium!  What's with Seymour? Its like he don't want you to go. Or he thinks your pants is too short or somethin'. Which is crazy 'cause frankly you look fabulous. Now get goin'!!
12366,FRY,I won't be gone long Seymour. Just wait here 'til I come back.
12367,FRY,Hello? Pizza delivery for......Icy Wiener?! Aw crud! I always thought at this point in my life I'd be the one making the crank calls!  Here's to another lousy Millenium.  What the?
12368,BENDER,A dog collar for me?  You shouldn't have!
12369,FRY,That's for Seymour.
12370,BENDER,Oh.  Say why'd you get me a subscription to the Daily Growl? That's not a reputable journal of opinion.
12371,FRY,Oh that's also for Seymour. I'm getting everything ready for when he's cloned.
12372,BENDER,Are you on the jump Fry? Why are you wasting time on a creature of inferior intelligence?
12373,FRY,Hey he was smart. He could fetch.
12374,BENDER,I can fetch.
12375,FRY,He could dig up bones.
12376,BENDER,"Hello? Charlamange?  Plus, I'll bet he couldn't create a laser show with his head."
12377,FRY,"Look Bender, this has nothing to do with you."
12378,BENDER,That's impossible!
12379,FRY,Now if you'll excuse me I'm working on Seymour's doghouse.
12380,BENDER,"No one ever asks if Bender would like to live in a tiny little house. Not that I would. A tiny little house that says ""Bender"" on it.  Ow!"
12381,FRY [ON ANSWERPHONE],"This is Fry. If you're calling about the used towels for sale, they're still available for $45 each."
12382,MR FRY,"Phil, it's your father. Where are you? You're holding up New Years brunch. Your brother can't wait any longer."
12383,YANCY,Hello first baloney of the new millenium! Ah here he comes. That's him and Seymour.
12384,MRS FRY,Well that's odd. Seymour's here but -  - Go! Go! Touchdown!! But where's Philip?
12385,MR FRY,"I'm tellin' you the Y2K computer's got him. We'll face burnin' roads, rivers explodin' and calculators transformed into SCUD missiles. There's nothing we can do.  What's that Seymour? You walking on sunshine?"
12386,YANCY,He's trying to tell us something. Maybe he can lead us to Philip.
12387,YANCY,Should we follow him?
12388,MR FRY,To our deaths? Negatory.
12389,MR FRY,It's the Y2K tryin' to lure us into an ambush. And I ain't buyin' it. Pass the baloney.
12390,FRY,Are you two gonna be done soon?
12391,LEELA,"Sorry, but we need to practice hand to hand combat in case an enemy knocks the laser gun out of our hands and they slide waaay across the room."
12392,FRY,Well could you do it some place else? I'm setting up Seymour's doggy bed.
12393,LEELA,
12394,BENDER,"Heel boy, heel! Oh hello Fry, I guess I didn't notice you there. I'm having such fun with my new best friend Robo-Puppy."
12395,FRY (NOT CARING),That's nice.
12396,BENDER,"I was just out walking him. Yes. You can walk him. Of course, after he goes you have to refill the canisters. C'mere boy! Pet, pet, pet."
12397,ROBO-PUPPY,Robo-Puppy receiving petting.
12398,AMY,"Bender, are you jealous of Fry's puppy? That's so adorable!"
12399,BENDER,"Jealous? Hah!  Not while I have the love of Robo-Puppy here. Robo-Puppy, lick my cheek."
12400,ROBO-PUPPY,Robo-Puppy preparing to lick cheek. Robo-Puppy commencing cheek licking. Licking in progress. Licking complete.
12401,BENDER,Robo-Puppy truly is robots best friend! Eh?
12402,FRY,"Ah there, perfect!"
12403,HOLO-FARNSWORTH,Good news everyone! The Clone-O-Mat is ready!
12404,LEELA,Woohoo!
12405,AMY,Yay!
12406,FRY,Finally!
12407,ROBO-PUPPY,Robo-Puppy commencing two hour yipping session.  Robo-Puppy mistreatment alert! Robo-Puppy mistreatment alert!
12408,FARNSWORTH,Behold once more the mighty Clone-O-Mat! Requiring such vast amounts of electricity that we must harness the elemental power of nature itself!  I speak of course...of molten lava! Deep within the Earth's core. To the sub-basement!
12409,FRY,Come on boy! Come back to life!
12410,BENDER,"Fry c'mon, the talent show!"
12411,FRY,What? I'm in the middle of something.
12412,BENDER,"But, if we don't perform, in what sense do we have an act?"
12413,FRY,"Bender, enough! Leave me alone!"
12414,BENDER,So that's how it is huh? I thought you were my friend. But if you love your dog so much then maybe you'd rather play fetch!
12415,LEELA,No!
12416,ZOIDBERG,Oh!
12417,BENDER,Now I'm all you got!
12418,FRY,I hate you! I hate you! You evil metal man!  Ow!
12419,BENDER,So anyway your dog is melted. Now we're friends again.
12420,FARNSWORTH,Not necessarily. For the dog may yet survive.
12421,FRY,May yet? Really?
12422,FARNSWORTH,"Indeed. You see, that fossil was made of dolomite. The tough black mineral that won't cop out when there's heat all about. By contrast, observe the lava's affect on this ice swan.  Of course, that would have melted even at room temperature. I just wanted to get rid of it. But had it been made of that righteous mineral dolomite, there's a slim chance it might have survived."
12423,FRY,So Seymour might still exist?
12424,FARNSWORTH,Perhaps. For a few minutes. It's dolomite baby!
12425,FRY,Then I'm goin' in after him.
12426,AMY,No!
12427,ZOIDBERG,Stop!
12428,FRY,He'd come after me.
12429,LEELA,Acting like a moron won't bring your dog back.
12430,FRY,Then all hope is lost.  Goodbye Seymour.
12431,BENDER,Please stop crying Fry. Here.  I assumed you were just pretending to love the dog. To toy with my emotions. Oh what have I done?
12432,ZOIDBERG,You didn't do anything. Don't beat yourself up.
12433,BENDER,"Fry, I'm sorry. I should have understood how someone can love an inferior creature. Because I love you. Not in the way of the Ancient Greeks, but in the way a robot loves a human, a human loves a dog and occassionally, a gorilla loves a kitty.  I'm goin' in!"
12434,FARNSWORTH,I'm a professor! Why isn't anyone listening to me? You can't go in because you'll melt. The fossil only has a chance because it's made of dolomite!
12435,BENDER,I'm 40% dolomite!
12436,BENDER,"Oh it's hot, it's very hot!"
12437,CRYOGENISIST,"Ugh, I am one hungover cryogenisist! Just throw that mutt in the freezer until his owners get here!"
12438,MAN,You can't solve all your problems by freezing them boss.
12439,CRYOGENISIST,I think you're forgetting our motto.
12440,MR FRY,Are you the cryogenisist who called about our son's dog?
12441,CRYOGENISIST,Oh you must be the Fry's. Yeah he's right over there.
12442,MRS FRY,"Sorry we're late, we all got sick from eating bad baloney!"
12443,MR FRY,
12444,MRS FRY,What's he so worked up about?
12445,MR FRY,He's just upset because our boy's missing. C'mon you overgrown rat. Lead us to Philip.
12446,LEELA,Bender's been down there too long. I'm going in after him.
12447,FARNSWORTH,Professor! Lava! Hot!
12448,FRY,This is all my fault. I let my best friend risk his life just to get my dead dog back.  Bender!!
12449,BENDER,And that is why they call me Bender The Magnificent!  Hey where'd everybody go?
12450,BENDER,OK! Let's clone us some dog!
12451,FRY,Yeah!
12452,FARNSWORTH,Very well. Let this abomination unto the Lord begin!  Interesting. It seems Seymour died at the ripe old age of 15.
12453,FRY,15? You mean he lived for 12 more years after I got frozen?
12454,FARNSWORTH,Indeed.
12455,FRY,Stop the cloning.
12456,FARNSWORTH,Oh sure! Smash the smart guy's machine!
12457,BENDER,"Fry, what's wrong?"
12458,FRY,Think about it. Seymour lived a full life after I was gone. He probably added new songs to his repertoire.
12459,BENDER,But that's a good thing. Walking On Sunshine sucks noodles!
12460,FRY,I had Seymour 'til he was three. That's when I knew him and that's when I loved him.  I'll never forget him. But he forgot me a long long time ago.
12461,THE END,
12462,"""THE ROUTE OF ALL EVIL""",
12463,BENDER,Ah beer! So many choices! And it makes so little difference.
12464,FRY,How 'bout Löbrau? It has dots on it.
12465,BENDER,Overruled. The choice of champions is Pabst Blue Robot!
12466,FRY,I can't drink that! The metal shavings make my throat bloody.
12467,BENDER,(mocking) Waah waah! Baby wants a Zima!
12468,LEELA,Hey hey! We can all fight when we're drunk. Now listen: Why don't we just brew our own beer?
12469,BENDER,You can brew your own beer?
12470,LEELA,"Sure, the kids at the orphanarium used to do it all the time."
12471,HERMES,Cursed bacteria of Liberia. My own son suspended from boarding school.
12472,DWIGHT,It's not my fault Dad.
12473,FARNSWORTH,And you Cubert. I cloned you from one of my warts and I can send you straight back in there.
12474,CUBERT,Nuh-uh!
12475,ZOIDBERG,What's going on? Is this angry yelling or busted hearing aid yelling?
12476,HERMES,I'm afraid it's both.
12477,FARNSWORTH,(shouting) What?
12478,LABARBARA,"Now hold on, everyone cool your daiquiris! Let's give the little vermin a chance to explain themselves."
12479,DWIGHT,It was self defence Mom. Just look at the letter the Principal sent.  We were in science class and we had just finished building a minature black hole.
12480,CUBERT [ON TV],That was easy.
12481,BRET [ON TV],Pretty scrawny black hole. It must be hungry.
12482,CUBERT [ON TV],Duh! Black holes don't need food.
12483,BRET [ON TV],Neither do nerds!
12484,CUBERT [ON TV],That's it Bret. You've compressed our lunches to a singularity for the last time! Salt him Dwight!
12485,BRET [ON TV],"When I resolidify, I'm gonna put you in a world of goop!"
12486,CUBERT,See? That bully started it. We couldn't fight back with brawn so we used our brains!
12487,FARNSWORTH,I've warned you not to use those things!
12488,LEELA,"Let's see. We've got our malt, our hops...we just need a big disposable tub to mix it in."
12489,BENDER,Yo!
12490,LEELA,Now it needs to boil for a couple hours.
12491,HERMES,"Dwight, you remember the crew?"
12492,DWIGHT,(unenthusiastically) Eh...
12493,FARNSWORTH,"Crew, you remember Cubert?  Wonderful! And I'm sure you won't mind being their legal guardians for a month!"
12494,CUBERT,"Well, well.  If it isn't my old friend stretchpants......no pants and...He looks at Fry.]...idiot!"
12495,BENDER,We're making beer! I'm the brewery.
12496,DWIGHT,I heard alcohol makes you stupid.
12497,FRY,No I'm...doesn't.
12498,LEELA,Actually Dwight you're right. Alcohol is very very bad...for children. But once you turn 21 it becomes very very good! So scram!
12499,DWIGHT,Aw man!
12500,CUBERT,Stupid...
12501,CUBERT,Hey Dad! What useless contraption are you half-baking today?
12502,FARNSWORTH,Eh wha? Oh! This is my latest invention. A device that lets anyone sound exactly like me!
12503,CUBERT,(Farnsworth's voice) Good news everyone! I'm a horse's butt!
12504,FARNSWORTH,I am? That's not good news at all you little...
12505,DWIGHT,What's this device's marketability? Who's the target consumer?
12506,FARNSWORTH,There is no target consumer! Only targets. Targets that will tremble as their new master hands down edicts in my glorious booming voice!  Now quit pestering me you scoundrels!
12507,DWIGHT,Can I collate that?
12508,HERMES,No!
12509,CUBERT,Can I shread these contracts?
12510,HERMES,No!
12511,DWIGHT,Wow! A powerstamper!
12512,HERMES,Now look at all the work I gotta do! Ow!
12513,LEELA,Mmm. The ingredients are cooked. And they've picked up some of your natural robot flavourings. Time to add the yeast.
12514,BENDER,Yeast? You mean I'll have a lifeform growing inside me? (crying) It's so beautiful.
12515,LEELA,Talk to me.
12516,CUBERT,"(Farnsworth's voice) Sorry I can't come down to say goodbye, but I'm busy inventing useless junk."
12517,DWIGHT,(Farnsworth's voice) And I smell bad.
12518,CUBERT,Hey!
12519,LEELA,If you were my kids you'd get quite a talking to...from your father......when he got home from the senate.
12520,FARNSWORTH,"Oh bother, what have they done now?"
12521,BENDER,Those pork dumplings sent us on a fake delivery.
12522,FRY,The address was on Dogdoo 8 but the universe ends right after Dogdoo 7!
12523,HERMES,"Child man, is this true?"
12524,DWIGHT,"Yeah, but why are you mad at us? Your dummy brigade wasted a week on an obviously fake mission!"
12525,CUBERT,"Plus, you're making bootleg beer inside company property!"
12526,BENDER,(shouting) Lies! Lies and slander!
12527,FARNSWORTH,Accusing gentle Bender of a misdeed? That's the last straw! You boys have been underfoot long enough!
12528,HERMES,You jerked the words right outta my mouth. We're their fathers and its high time we acted like it.
12529,BENDER,Ooo-hoo! Here comes violence!
12530,HERMES,Get a job you lazy kids!
12531,BENDER,I guess if you want children beaten......you have to do it yourself.
12532,CUBERT,"Come on Dad, shuffle faster!"
12533,DWIGHT,You don't wanna miss the unveiling of our new company do you?
12534,HERMES,Company?  (mocking) How cute! What will you be pedalling? Lemonade? Shoe shines? Cootie insurance?
12535,FARNSWORTH,(mocking) Perhaps they've constructed a teddybear hospital!
12536,CUBERT,"Actually, we're starting a competing delivery company."
12537,HERMES,Welcome to the world of business!
12538,FARNSWORTH,Who's going to use a delivery service with a kicked sign? Nobody that's who!
12539,DWIGHT,But we already have a client signed up! We're delivering the Daily Supernova.
12540,HERMES,So your delivery company is just a cute harmless paper route?
12541,FARNSWORTH,Phew!
12542,DWIGHT,No. Its a serious business.
12543,FARNSWORTH,(mocking) Yes its a tremendous responsibility alright!  What if a paper were to land in a puddle?
12544,HERMES,(mocking) Civilisation as we know it might get splashed!
12545,DWIGHT,Why do they always treat us like dumb kids? We're practically old enough to find the Fox Network infantile!
12546,CUBERT,Ah we'll show 'em. All Awesome Express needs is a sturdy interstellar delivery craft!  Voila! You got a quarter?
12547,DWIGHT,"Man, that ad said to allow four to six seconds for delivery."
12548,CUBERT,More like seven!
12549,BENDER,I'm really starting to swell up with beer. I must look ridiculous.
12550,FRY,"No, you have a healthy glow."
12551,BENDER,Oh my God! I just felt it ferment!
12552,LEELA,Ooo! Let me feel.  Have you thought about what to name it?
12553,BENDER,"I was thinking Benderbrau if it's an ale, Botweiser if it's a lager."
12554,FRY,I hope it's a lager so I can take it to a ball game.  Ooo! I felt that one!
12555,CUBERT,"Uh, there's a crack in the hull here. That could cause explosive decompression."
12556,DWIGHT,Put a sticker on it.
12557,HERMES,Off on your first delivery eh? You be careful my little tinkler.  Remember we used to call you that huh? Tinkler?
12558,SAL,Gets movin'! Those newspapers won'ts deliver themselveses! Only the Sunday edition can dos that.
12559,FARNSWORTH,"Goodness there must be 50 papers in that bundle! That's a big number, 50."
12560,CUBERT,Yeah if you're an idiot!
12561,DWIGHT,3. 2. 1.
12562,CUBERT,All systems go.
12563,DWIGHT,Blast off!
12564,HERMES,(shouting) See you at din-din!
12565,FARNSWORTH,(shouting) I'm blowing you a kiss.
12566,CUBERT,Take evasive action!
12567,FARNSWORTH,(shouting) It's closing in! You can't avoid it! It's a cheek-seeker. And...gotcha!
12568,HERMES,Business is down. So I filed papers to have you all reclassified as slaves.
12569,FARNSWORTH,"Well, well, well. If it isn't our little muchkin moguls!"
12570,HERMES,What's the trouble men? Need some penny rolls for your profits?
12571,CUBERT,"Actually, thank's to Dwight's brilliant accounting and my unaccountable brilliance......our paper route now has over a million customers!"
12572,DWIGHT,We're finally making more money than you guys! Aren't you impressed now Pops? Aren'tcha? Aren'tcha?
12573,HERMES,"Uh, in a small way yes. But you still don't have your own building, your own conference table or...or one of those things!"
12574,ZOIDBERG,Hello!
12575,DWIGHT,"Our Dads are never impressed, no matter what we do."
12576,CUBERT,Maybe we should start a fire.
12577,DWIGHT,If we really want to impress them we'll have to crush them with strategy...Dwight Lightning!
12578,CUBERT,Very well. But I get to name the next strategy.
12579,ANNOUNCER [ON TV],This week on The Real World: The Sun.
12580,MAN [ON TV],Argh! I'm burning to death!
12581,LEELA,You know how much an apartment that big would cost on the Sun?
12582,HERMES,"People, as you know our young sons have become great successes in the very same field as us."
12583,FRY [SIMULTANEOUSLY],That's great!
12584,HERMES,"Naturally, we're humiliated."
12585,FARNSWORTH,"That's why we need you, our loyal crew, to make Planet Express 800% more profitable."
12586,HERMES,We'll start by slashing salaries. And this time I mean really slash.
12587,LEELA,"Uh guys, I don't know how to tell you this. So I'll just let Fry blurt it out thoughtlessly."
12588,FRY,We don't work for you anymore!
12589,FARNSWORTH,What?
12590,LEELA,Dwight and Cubert made us a better offer. We're paperboys now.
12591,CUBERT,Incoming! We got papers to stuff team! Hup two hup two!
12592,FRY,Yes sir!
12593,BENDER,On our way!
12594,LEELA,We're on it Mr Farnsworth!
12595,FARNSWORTH,"Folks, the situation is grim but we shall prevail, thanks to you, our crack team of loyal dregs!"
12596,HERMES,I don't even know who this guy is!
12597,SCRUFFY,"I'm Scruffy, the janitor."
12598,FARNSWORTH,"Yes, of course you are. Now we've got to buckle down and save Planet Express."
12599,SCRUFFY,I'm on break.
12600,CUBERT,"Sorry to interrupt this ""whirlwind of activity"" but we have an announcement."
12601,DWIGHT,"I direct your attention to these forms, which I'm presently engaged in handing to you."
12602,HERMES,Sweet guineapig of Winnipeg! They've taken over our company!
12603,FARNSWORTH,Balderdash! I never agreed to that!
12604,DWIGHT,No. But you did declare yourself dead three years ago as a tax dodge.
12605,FARNSWORTH,Tax dodge nothing! You take one nap in a ditch in the park and they start declaring you this and that.
12606,CUBERT,Either way I technically inherit your building and your spaceship. Which mean Planet Express is now......Awesome Express!
12607,HERMES,(angry) You rotten kids! (nicely) Will you be hiring?
12608,DWIGHT,No.
12609,HERMES,(angry) You rotten kids!
12610,FRY,There. One million papers. Folded and loaded!
12611,CUBERT,"Hey Leela, help me apply these flame decals I got in my cereal. They'll make the ship go faster."
12612,LEELA,And what's your scientific basis for thinking that?
12613,CUBERT,I'm 12.
12614,FARNSWORTH,Did I ever tell you how I used to own that ship?
12615,ZOIDBERG,There but for the grace of God.
12616,BENDER,(singing) Hush little brewsky don't you leak. Daddy wants to drink for at least a week.  Oh my God! I think it's time!
12617,FRY,"Hurry Leela, get some coasters and cold mugs."
12618,FRY,Push Bender push!
12619,LEELA,You're doing great!
12620,BENDER,It feels like I'm trying to push a water bed out of me.
12621,FRY,Almost there. Just two more bottles.
12622,BENDER,Is it OK? I can't hear anything.
12623,FRY,"It's an ale! 5 gallons, 6 ounces!"
12624,DWIGHT,"Hey, what's goin' on? This is a delivery company not a delivery room!"
12625,CUBERT,We just busted our bums delivering a million newspapers and this is how you greet us? With a bunch of frosty cold beers?
12626,FRY,Hey wait a second. How did you deliver a million papers in one hour?
12627,CUBERT,Uh...we just did OK? 'Cause we're awesome! Yeah!
12628,DWIGHT,Yeah awesome!
12629,LEELA,"Hello, Awesome Express, the rude, crude delivery dudes! How may I direct your call?...What's that?...You haven't gotten your paper?...In how long?..."
12630,FARNSWORTH,"Uh, might a homeless old man have a touch more beef bourguignon? And another tequila slammer?  Please?"
12631,LABARBARA,Don't you sweet talk me you wrinkly old tube sack!
12632,HERMES,Might I have one too wife?
12633,LABARBARA,"Ah you're both pathetic, being jealous of your own offspring. Now you should be happy they became successes, instead of following in your footstamps."
12634,HERMES,Oh it's true. But they grow up so fast. We just wanted a few more years of being better than them.
12635,FARNSWORTH,They're so stinking talented they don't even need their fathers anymore.
12636,CUBERT,Dad! We screwed up!
12637,FARNSWORTH,You did? Tough luck suckers!
12638,DWIGHT,"Please, help us Pops. We agreed to deliver way more papers than we can handle."
12639,CUBERT,(crying) But we couldn't handle them so we started dumping the extras in a crater on the Moon.
12640,DWIGHT,(crying) And now everyone's yelling at us about our missing papers!
12641,CUBERT,(crying) And now we don't know what to do!
12642,FARNSWORTH,Why did you boys do all this?
12643,DWIGHT,(crying) We just wanted you to be proud of us.
12644,HERMES,"Proud of you? You ruined us with sleazy business practices and a complete disregard for human decency. But, of course we're proud of you."
12645,FARNSWORTH,Damn right we are! Now come on. Let's go do a little Father/Son weaseling out of this.
12646,HERMES,"OK boys, let me show you how a paper man does it."
12647,BOY,Au revoir!!
12648,DWIGHT,Can I use the gun Dad?
12649,HERMES,Aw what kind of father would I be if I said no?
12650,DWIGHT,Only one house to go. We did it!
12651,DWIGHT,Run away! That bully Bret Blob lives there!
12652,CUBERT,"He's ugly, mean, stupid, stink, mucus! And last week...we sort of...broke his window."
12653,HERMES,"Alright, alright. What do we do when we break somebody's window?"
12654,DWIGHT,(sheepish) Pay for it?
12655,HERMES,Heavens no! We apologise! With nice cheap words!
12656,BRET,I thought I heard the doorbell but I see it was the dorkbell!
12657,DWIGHT,"Man, we had it coming Bret!"
12658,FARNSWORTH,"Now now, no need to give us the business. We'd like a word with you daddy."
12659,BRET,Whatever. (shouting) Daaad!
12660,HERMES,Don't worry boys. I'm sure his father is a perfectly normal reasonable man.
12661,FARNSWORTH,"Mr Blob, our sons have come to apologise for damaging your window. They've learned their lesson and they want to make amends."
12662,CUBERT,(ashamed) Sorry sir.
12663,DWIGHT,"(ashamed) Yeah, sorry."
12664,FARNSWORTH,Now see here. We assured our sons that you'd accept their apology.
12665,FARNSWORTH,No one gives my son that option!
12666,HERMES,Bring it on Jello-pop!
12667,CUBERT,Yeah go Dad!
12668,DWIGHT,Show 'em who's boss!  Get 'em...Pops!
12669,CUBERT,That was incredible! You are the bravest dads in the entire trauma centre!
12670,DWIGHT,You guys almost had him...until he digested you.
12671,HERMES,"Aww, you're good kids.  If I could feel anything right now, it would be pride. I was wrong! I can still feel pain!"
12672,FARNSWORTH,He's coming to finish the job. Someone toss me out the window!
12673,FARNSWORTH,I suppose.
12674,BENDER,Hey chumps! I heard you were on the ass end of an ass kicking so I figured you could use a couple of these babys!
12675,HERMES,Oh why not! Might as well live it up as long as I 've got this catheter in me!
12676,FARNSWORTH,"Uh, won't join us Mr Blob?"
12677,HERMES,"This is what makes life worth clinging to. Three fathers, enjoying a day out with their sons."
12678,FARNSWORTH,"It would seem we've taught our boys a lesson about life: Man or Blob, it's whats inside that counts."
12679,THE END,
12680,"""A TASTE OF FREEDOM""",
12681,ZOIDBERG,"(singing) Freedom, freedom, freedom, oy!"
12682,FRY,"There's no denying it: The future's crazy! Oh, well. Don't wanna stand out."
12683,FRY AND ZOIDBERG,"(singing) Freedom, freedom, freedom, oy!"
12684,ZOIDBERG,There's nothing crazy about it. It's just Freedom Day!
12685,FARNSWORTH,... an extremely dangerous mission ...
12686,FRY,"So, what is Freedom Day? Sounds like some kind of feminine hygiene product."
12687,ZOIDBERG,"No, it's a fabulous, crab-ulous day!"
12688,AMY,"If you wanna do something, you do it! And to splick with the consequences!"
12689,BENDER,You know? Like how I live every day.
12690,HERMES,Happy Freedom Day! Ooh! I think my wrist is broken.
12691,FARNSWORTH,"Of course, it wouldn't be Freedom Day without the traditional Freedom Tub!"
12692,HERMES,Mmm! That'll feel nice on my shattered bones!
12693,FRY,Wow! Nude hot-tubbing? That's all I need to hear about Freedom Day!
12694,ZOIDBERG,"Then consider the following lecture a bonus: On Earth, freedom is a given. But on my planet, we have to suffer for it."
12695,DECAPODIAN WOMAN,"Sure, you can be a comedian instead of a doctor -- If you want your parents to roll over in their graves!"
12696,DECAPODIAN MAN,Sure. You can vote for Shkinadel -- If you want there should be a recession!
12697,DECAPODIAN WOMAN,Sure. You can go to medical school -- If you've given up on your dream of being a comedian!
12698,ZOIDBERG,"That's why I love Earth! You can do what you want, and no-one makes you feel guilty because no-one cares."
12699,FRY,(shouting) We're not listening!
12700,ZOIDBERG,That's what I'm talking about!
12701,STILT PEOPLE,"(chanting) Freedom, freedom, freedom, oy! Freedom, freedom, freedom, oy!"
12702,BENDER,"Scuse me, comin' through. Freedom train arriving on track one."
12703,WOMAN,Ow! You broke my foot!
12704,BENDER,Freedom!
12705,MORBO,"What's this next float, Linda?"
12706,LINDA,"Representing our men, women and children in uniform, it's Earth's greatest space hero, Zapp Brannigan!"
12707,ZAPP,"Happy Freedom Day, ladies!  Come on, let loose and show me something!  Anything. Seriously, I'd take an armpit.  Oh, yeah! Thank you, Linda!"
12708,LINDA,"You're welcome! OK, Morbo, now it's your turn."
12709,MORBO,If that is your Freedom Day wish.
12710,NIXON,"Thank you, Secretary of Transportation. My fellow Earthicans, we enjoy so much freedom, it's almost sickening. We're free to choose which hand our sex-monitoring chip is implanted in. And if we don't want to pay our taxes, why, we're free to spend a weekend with the Pain Monster."
12711,PAIN MONSTER,"See you April 15th, folks!"
12712,NIXON,"Cue the fireworks guy!  Incidentally, tonight's Freedom Day celebration is brought to you by ...  ... ""Shankman's Rubbing Compound"". When something needs rubbing, think ""Shankman""."
12713,BENDER,Yay! Shankman!
12714,HERMES,It costs a little more but it's worth it!
12715,NIXON,"Our planet has been through so much this past year: Wars, droughts, impeachments! But we've never lost our sense of what's truly important: The great taste of ""Charleston Chew""!  And now, let us salute that beloved symbol of freedom, our flag, Ol' Freebie!"
12716,ZOIDBERG,I'm swelling with patriotic mucus!
12717,NIXON,"In our darkest hour, we can stand erect, with proud upthrust bosoms!"
12718,FRY,Anyone who laughs is a Communist!
12719,NIXON,"Knowing that, with a shifty glance skyward, we will see by the rocket's red glare, that our flag is still there.  It's gone!"
12720,ZOIDBERG,"Yes, fellow patriots, I ate your flag. And I did it with pride. For to express oneself with doing a thing is the very essence of Freedom Day! Bless this planet and all its wonderful people!"
12721,NIXON,(shouting) Kill him! Kill the traitor!
12722,MAN,"Hey, it's the guy who desecrated our flag!"
12723,NIXON,Stop that red menace!
12724,ZOIDBERG,I'm all scuttled out!  Huh? My planet's embassy? They're paid to not kill me! A-yoop!
12725,ZOIDBERG,"I thought I understood this world. I thought I was fitting in. But I guess I don't belong on here anymore than I belong on our crappy home planet-- Ooh, sorry."
12726,DECAPODIAN MAN,"What sorry? Our planet stinks, we all know it."
12727,AMBASSADOR MOIVIN,"Enough with the persecution, I'm saying. Zoidberg, as Ambassador, I promise you the full support of our government already."
12728,DECAPODIAN WOMAN,Poor boy. You want maybe a nice mug cocoa?
12729,ZOIDBERG,"Ambassador Moivin, you and your staff are so kind. I'm truly humbled.  What, no marshmallows?"
12730,NIXON,Let's storm the place ... without my prior knowledge.
12731,BENDER,"Scuse me, comin' through. Freedom train, step aside. You too, fatso. Freedom!"
12732,LEELA,"Cool your jowls, Nixon. You may not like it that Dr. Zoidberg desecrated a flag. You might even find the image of it festering in his bowels somehow offensive. But the right to freedom of expression is guaranteed by the Earth constitution."
12733,NIXON,Aroo! Maybe so. But I know a place where the constitution doesn't mean squat.
12734,MYRTLE FU,The Supreme Court hereby accepts the case of Earth vs Zoidberg.
12735,NIXON,Sock it to 'em!
12736,CROWD,"(chanting) Two, four, six, eight,"
12737,SCOUT LEADER,Now your noose knot has exactly seven twists.
12738,MAN,"(singing) You can eat my dog,"
12739,CROWD,(chanting) Don't mess with Earth!
12740,FRY,They sure hate Dr. Zoidberg.
12741,BENDER,Pft. Posers! I was hating Zoidberg before it was cool.
12742,FRY,Where are we ever going to find a lawyer to take his case?
12743,LEELA,I'll ask the head of the ACLU. Once he's done singing.
12744,MAN,(singing) Don't mess with Earth. (talking) Kill Zoidberg! Goodnight!
12745,OLD MAN WATERFALL,Howdy there! I'm a lawyer and I'd like to help your friend out of his pickle.
12746,FRY,"Who are you, old man?"
12747,OLD MAN WATERFALL,"Name's Old Man Waterfall. But most folks just call me ""Old Man""."
12748,FRY,I'll never remember that.
12749,OLD MAN WATERFALL,"I'm a veteran of three dozen wars. Name a body part and a planet and I've taken a bullet in it, on it. All to keep our flag flying free."
12750,BENDER,"And you wanna defend Zoidberg? Are you familiar with the old robot saying ""Does Not Compute""?"
12751,OLD MAN WATERFALL,"Son, to me a robot's just a garbage can with sparks comin' out it."
12752,BENDER,(sad) The sparks keep me warm.
12753,OLD MAN WATERFALL,I don't condone what Dr. Zoidberg did but I'll fight tooth and nail for his freedom to do it. Or I would if I hadn't lost my teeth and nails on Mars and Saturn respectively.
12754,FRY,"Wait, you're a lawyer? You're hired!"
12755,FRY,"You OK there in the embassy, Zoidberg?"
12756,HOLO-ZOIDBERG,No. There's no coaco marshmallows and every night the rats eat a little more of my foot.
12757,BAILIFF,"Oyez, oyez, oyez. All rise for the Honourable Chief Justice, Myrtle Fu, and the associate justices."
12758,MYRTLE FU,"Counsel, you may address the court on behalf of Earth, if you're ready."
12759,HYPER-CHICKEN,"I was hatched ready! Honourable judge heads, yonder crawdad done ate up our flag."
12760,HOLO-ZOIDBERG,I was doing freedom of speech. Earth's most sacred right.
12761,HYPER-CHICKEN,"Your Honour, freedom of speech applies to what comes out of a mouth. Not what goes in."
12762,O'CONNOR,Can counsel cite precedent?
12763,HYPER-CHICKEN,"Uh, yes darlin', I can. In ""State Of Alabama vs. Giant Space Iguana"", chewin' the corners off the constitution was deemed ""nonprotected speech""."
12764,SOUTER,"He shut you up, O'Connor."
12765,MYRTLE FU,"Mr. Waterfall, you may now present arguments on behalf of Dr. Zoidberg."
12766,HOLO-ZOIDBERG,"Oh, God, I'm nervous. Two of my three hearts are having attacks."
12767,BENDER,Court's kinda fun when it's not my ass on the line! Nachos?
12768,OLD MAN WATERFALL,"Oh, land-o-Goshen! Your Honours, I'm not some slick, big-city lawyer like my opponent here.  But I am a veteran who has fought for his planet. You see this hand of mine?"
12769,SCALIA,"Yes, I do."
12770,OLD MAN WATERFALL,"No, you don't  'Cause I lost my real hand plantin' the flag when we took back Halley's Comet! Yet it was worth it. So much do I love that flag.  I love it even more than I love my seven wives. That's right, I'm a polygamist. Yet I would gladly eat a flag myself, had I not used my intestine as a rope to hoist a flag made of my own skin, if it would protect the freedoms of the proud people who salute that flag. Freedom such as polygamy.  I rest my case.  Whoa, jeez!"
12771,MYRTLE FU,"The justices and I will now confer using high-speed telepathy.  By a vote of six to three, we find that flag eating is not protected by the constitution."
12772,BENDER,Six to three? I beat the spread!
12773,MYRTLE FU,The court orders an immediate public apology.
12774,HOLO-ZOIDBERG,Apology accepted. Just don't let it happen again.
12775,HERMES,"She means you, you turkey of the sea!"
12776,HOLO-ZOIDBERG,"Me? Apologise? Never! I came to this planet to learn the meaning of freedom. But I say it's you who should get a nice lesson! So do your worst, because no punishment could be worse than denying my freedom."
12777,MYRTLE FU,You are hereby sentenced to death.
12778,HOLO-ZOIDBERG,"Wait, let me finish!"
12779,MYRTLE FU,"Also, in a rare double-whammy decision, the court finds polygamy constitutional."
12780,OLD MAN WATERFALL,I can't wait to tell my husband!
12781,ZAPP,"Remember, men: Take him alive so there's something left to kill."
12782,AMBASSADOR MOIVIN,Stay back! This embassy is sovereign mud of the mud planet Decapod 10. Invading these mud premises is an act of war.
12783,ZAPP,"Yeah? Well what are you going to do about it, Shrimp-y?"
12784,AMBASSADOR MOIVIN,"You wanna see, Mr. Big-Shot?  Attack Earth.  Yes I know it's a schlep. Just do it!"
12785,ZOIDBERG,Aha! Now the rubber band's on the other claw!
12786,ZAPP,Ready? Retreat!
12787,PERSON,(from library) Sh!
12788,ZOIDBERG,"Deny my freedom, will you? Well we'll do to you what we did to the Squash Men of the Squash Planet! Squish them!"
12789,AMBASSADOR MOIVIN,Charleston Chew?
12790,ZOIDBERG,You bet!
12791,ZAPP,"Alright, Kif, let's show these freaks what a bloated, runaway military budget can do. Bring me the activation codes for our global defence network."
12792,KIF,"(unenthusiastic) Aye, aye, sir."
12793,COMPUTER VOICE,Commence lip identification scan.  No tongue.
12794,ZAPP,"We can't be too careful with these codes. Rumour has it a double agent may be aboard this very ship.  I'm watching you! You, ensign? What's your name?"
12795,"""ENSIGN""","Hugh Man, sir!"
12796,ZAPP,"Hugh Man? Now that's a name I can trust. Run down to the central battle computer and enter these codes. Chop, chop!"
12797,KIF,"Um, sir? There's something about that ensign that's--"
12798,ZAPP,You're damn right there is! That strapping young lad's gunning for your job. And he just might get it.
12799,ZAPP,"The enemy approacheth! Lieutenant, fire missile one and recommend me for another medal. Make it gaudy, I'm going clubbing later.  Tick, tock!"
12800,KIF,"Sir, all planetary defences have been disabled. Perhaps the Decapodians acquired our secret codes, somehow."
12801,ZAPP,"Well, Kif, stand by to take the blame. Steady, steady ... now!"
12802,LEELA,"Dr. Zoidberg, how can you claim to love freedom and then enslave all of Earth?"
12803,ZOIDBERG,"Bah! Your planet doesn't deserve freedom until it learns what it is to not have freedom. It's a lesson, I say."
12804,FRY,Ow!
12805,BENDER,What the hell is this dirt pile we're building anyhow?
12806,ZOIDBERG,"None of your beeswax, slave! You'll find out soon enough. Just focus on globing that mud. (shouting) Glob!"
12807,FRY,I'm no good at being a slave. I'm thinking about graduate school. Y'know? To become a barber?
12808,LEELA,This can't go on. Today is the day we fight back!
12809,BENDER,It's already 10 o'clock!
12810,LEELA,"Oh, you're right. Tomorrow is the day we fight back."
12811,ZAPP,"Yeah? Well good luck, sister. All our modern technology is useless."
12812,BENDER,I know I am.
12813,FRY,"Hey, wait! I'm having one of those things. You know? A headache with pictures?"
12814,LEELA,An idea?
12815,FRY,"Back in my day, we didn't have your fancy all-digital weapons but we still managed to kill each other just fine."
12816,BENDER,"Ah, the crossbow. A pitiless, elegant killing machine. The Bender of the 15th century."
12817,FRY,Not big enough. We need something that can take out an entire army. Something you could commit a war crime with--
12818,BENDER,Wow!  Ow!
12819,AMBASSADOR MOIVIN,"Earth slaves, behold the fruit of your labours: The Mobile Oppression Palace."
12820,BENDER,Neat!
12821,AMBASSADOR MOIVIN,"I don't need to tell you that occupation forces are expensive. But with the Mobile Oppression Palace, a few dignitaries can oppress your entire planet for pennies a day.  Warships, dismissed!"
12822,OLD MAN WATERFALL,"Do your worst, you sea devils! I'll make my stand with Ol' Freebie. You can crush me but you can't crush my spirit!  Argh! My spirit!"
12823,FRIEDA WATERFALL,"Great Grandpa, no!  Another victim of the mano-centric male-ocracy."
12824,ZOIDBERG,"Ambassador Moivin, you killed my lawyer."
12825,AMBASSADOR MOIVIN,You're welcome.
12826,ZOIDBERG,He defended my freedom when no-one else would. He was a good and honourable man.
12827,OLD MAN WATERFALL,I request a Satanic funeral.
12828,ZOIDBERG,Is it possible that all this slavery and oppression is shmutzing up our freedom lesson?
12829,AMBASSADOR MOIVIN,"Ah, take a pill, Zoidberg. (shouting) Begin again with the crushing!"
12830,FRY,"You haven't won yet, Moivin! You didn't expect us to even go to a museum, much less steal this ancient heat-seeking missile."
12831,AMBASSADOR MOIVIN,I don't even know you.
12832,DECAPODIAN WOMAN,"Oh, it's gonna make such a mess!"
12833,AMBASSADOR MOIVIN,"This is your secret plan? Meh! Heat-seeking missiles are useless against the Mobile Oppression Palace. All Decapodian technology is cold-blooded, like us!"
12834,ZOIDBERG,All eyes on Zoidberg!  Ew!
12835,BENDER,"Hey, I need that to smoke!"
12836,FRY,"Zoidberg, how could you? I used to think you were cool."
12837,ZOIDBERG,"Wait! People of Earth, listen. Yes, I'm desecrating a flag. But to preserve the freedom it represents!"
12838,LEELA,"Zoidberg, you set us free! I feel like I could stand to hug you! I can't, but you know what I'm trying to say."
12839,CROWD,(chanting) Zoidberg! Zoidberg! Zoidberg!
12840,ZOIDBERG,"Ah, if only they appreciated freedom this much on my home planet. Wait a second! They do! Because this is my home planet."
12841,NIXON,"And now, to raise this beautiful new flag, a red lobster that won't ruin your dinner: Dr. John Zoidberg!"
12842,ZOIDBERG,"You're a nice man, Nixon."
12843,SCOOP CHANG,"Dr. Zoidberg, how's about you take a bite of the flag for tomorrow's papers?"
12844,ZOIDBERG,"Oh, I couldn't."
12845,NIXON,"No, no, no, go ahead. You've earned it!"
12846,ZOIDBERG,"Well, maybe just a taste.  Mmm! Now that's a grand old flag!  I wonder what the Shroud of Turin tastes like."
12847,THE END,
12848,"""KIF GETS KNOCKED UP A NOTCH""",
12849,AMY,Woohoo!  Shman! The Great Rad Spot is mega sweet for mega party-boarding.
12850,FARNSWORTH,Indeed.
12851,AMY,Any calls while I was out?
12852,LEELA,Yeah. You got a telesonic transmission from Kif a couple hours ago.
12853,AMY,My Kiffie called?  Kif?
12854,KIF [ON SCREEN],Ooo Amy you're back. Another hour and I would have thought about hanging up.
12855,AMY,Why didn't you just leave a message sweetie?
12856,KIF [ON SCREEN],"Well um, I've left hundreds of messages with your answering machine but you never seem to..."
12857,AMY (SHOUTING),Bender!
12858,BENDER,Not my fault if you don't check me! Messages erased.
12859,KIF [ON SCREEN],"Oh dearest, this long distance relationship is too much to bear......when even an inch seperates us I quiver with misery. So you can imagine how I feel when it's a billion light years."
12860,AMY [ON SCREEN],"Kif, don't cry, or you'll get a tummy ache."
12861,ZAPP [ON SCREEN],"Lieutenant, some things came off me and clogged the drain so if you could......oh ho! What's this?"
12862,ZAPP,"Well well well! Do my eyes believe me or is that my bosomy swan, Leela?"
12863,LEELA [ON SCREEN],Say again. You're breaking up!
12864,FARNSWORTH,Good news everyone. You'll be delivering pain medicine to the hive mind of Nigel 7.
12865,SCRUFFY,Scruffy's rollin' out a large pill!
12866,AMY,You're going to Nigel 7? Kif's on patrol near there! You could drop me off on the way!
12867,FARNSWORTH,We could but we won't! It's a spaceship dammit not a prom limousine!  If anyone needs me I'll be in the Angry Dome.
12868,LEELA,"This is a very long trip, so we'll all have to go into hibernative-naptosis to save oxygen."
12869,BENDER,I don't even breathe oxygen!
12870,AMY (WHISPERING),Here I come Kif!
12871,ZAPP,"They jump right out of their pants! Oh what now? Activate glass window. Kif, I'm sensing a very sensual disturbance in the force. Prepare for ship-to-ship intimacy!"
12872,KIF,Yes sir captain!
12873,ZAPP,How 'bout I help you finish that dream you were having about me?
12874,LEELA,"OK, I was just at this part: Heyya!"
12875,ZAPP,"Uh, let's try that a little lower and a lot softer!"
12876,KIF,Imagine you stowing away and stealing a licenced starship! Oh it's so romantic it gives me the shivvers!
12877,AMY,I don't care how much trouble I get in. I needed to feel my lips pressed against your lipless beak!
12878,KIF,"Oh Amy, I can't stand having a whole universe between us. I've been thinking a lot about this and, well, would you move in with me?"
12879,AMY,Here? But...uh...wouldn't it be crowded?
12880,KIF,"No no, it's really twice the size! You can use the floor and, I'll have the ceiling! See?"
12881,AMY,"Kif! You have so much creativity and niceness, but......I'm not sure if I -"
12882,KIF,"Hush! Before you answer, come thither!"
12883,KIF,"This is the Holo-Shed. It can simulate anything you desire, and nothing can hurt you. Except when it malfunctions and the holograms become real."
12884,AMY,"Well, that probably won't happen this time."
12885,KIF,I wanted to show you what life would be like if we were together. Computer: Run program Kif-1.
12886,AMY,This is so beautiful!  Spirit! Kif! That's the pony I always wanted but my parents said I had too many ponies already!
12887,KIF,"Yes. I prgorammed it in for you! 4 million lines of BASIC! And, if this isn't the life you want, how 'bout this? Run program Kif-2!"
12888,AMY,Oh Kif!
12889,KIF,"We could live here by the shore of the tranquilibrious sea, in a timeshare. And I would pluck the moon from the sky, just to see you smile.  Almost got it.  It seems to be sort of, stuck! I love you!  Run program Kif://3."
12890,AMY,This isn't bad. My aunt had a place like this.
12891,KIF,"Amy, we could live in a bus station bathroom for all I care. As long as we're together it will feel like a castle to me."
12892,AMY,"Kif, I'd love to live with you...someday. But before then there's still lots I wanna do on my own.  What was that?"
12893,KIF,"Oh dear. I feel the Holo-Shed might be broken again. Well, as long as we don't cross paths with Atilla the -"
12894,AMY,Look! Spirit!
12895,KIF,"And there's Professor Moriarty, Jack The Ripper, Evil Lincoln!"
12896,MORIARTY,"Right-o gents it's another simulation gone mad so murder and mayhem, standard procedure!"
12897,JACK THE RIPPER,Rampage!!
12898,EVIL LINCOLN,Real hologram simulated Evil Lincoln is back!!
12899,KIF,"The Holo-Shed's on the fritz again, the characters turned real!"
12900,ZAPP,Damn. The last time that happened I got slapped with three paternity suits. Listen up history's greatest villains......Get back into the Holo-Shed before I start blasting!
12901,ATILLA THE HUN,Stop! Don't shoot fire stick in space canoe! Cause explosive decompression!
12902,ZAPP,Spare me your space-age technobabble Atilla The Hun!
12903,AMY,Kif! Hold on!
12904,KIF,I totally want to!
12905,LEELA,Grab on!
12906,FRY,Over here!
12907,KIF,Hold me!
12908,BENDER,"Have a good one!  Aw, man!"
12909,ZAPP,After all that I could use some relaxation. I'll be in the Holo-Shed.
12910,DOCTOR,"Well, except for a few broken bones, some internal hemoraging and a partially barfed up heart, everyone appears fine. Oh and Kif is pregnant."
12911,KIF,Oh joy!
12912,KIF,"Amy, isn't it wonderful? I'm pregnant!"
12913,AMY (UNSURE),Yes it's...great. A great miracle.
12914,LEELA,And not one of those bogus everyday miracles like a sunrise. Aren't you a male?
12915,BENDER,"Yeah what's the deal? Just when I thought I'd figured out you biological creatures, its something else! Lemme at 'im!  Come...over...lemme...!"
12916,ZAPP,"Look, I'm sure we're all a little unclear on how anyone gets pregnant. So Kif, pray explain. And don't spare the dirty words where appropriate."
12917,KIF,"Well it's quite simple really. When one of my species experiences deep feelings of love we enter a so called ""receptive state."""
12918,ZAPP,You disgust me! Go on.
12919,KIF,"At that point, our skin becomes a semi-permeable membrane which allows the passage of genetic material. I held Amy's hand and voila."
12920,BENDER,Oh OK. but that better be all there is!
12921,KIF,Oh Amy! You'll be a mother!
12922,KIF,What a wonderous affirmation of our love! And all from the touch of your hand.
12923,FRY,Dude hold up! Remember when Zapp blew a hole in the ship?
12924,EVIL LINCOLN,Indeed.
12925,FRY,Kif touched everybody there. Couldn't any one of us be the mother?
12926,AMY,Hey yeah!  I mean...what about that Kif?
12927,KIF,Well I suppose I might have gotten pregnant that way. Or even from a toilet seat. Though that's impossible since I have a private washroom.
12928,ZAPP,"Ah, my home away from home. By the way Kif, your flush seemed to be set on stun, not kill."
12929,AMY,"Look Kif, I probably am the mother. Although maybe I'm not. Of course I hope I am but just in case I'm not, maybe we should have a test."
12930,BENDER,A test. I demand a test!
12931,FARNSWORTH,"Even I laughed at me when I built this alien cross species genetic analyser but I guess I showed myself! Subjects, please enter the chamber.  Now to take a DNA sample.  When I pull this switch the maternifuge will spin at 10,000 RPM, seperating out everyone who isn't the mother....father...whatever."
12932,BENDER,Faster! Faster!
12933,FARNSWORTH,Good. Fry's ejection indicates that he is not the man-mom.  Nor is Captain Brannigan.
12934,KIF,Oh thank you merciful God!
12935,FARNSWORTH,Zoidberg?! What the hell were you doing in there?
12936,ZOIDBERG,That's where I live. I have no home.
12937,KIF,Amy? But that means...
12938,KIF,"Leela must have impregnated me when she grabbed my ungloved hand. That explains the poster in hygiene class: No Glove, No Love."
12939,LEELA,"Wow, this is all so confusing."
12940,ZAPP,Leela! How could you? Our love has had to endure your constant hatred and now this? (crying) Stop testing our love!
12941,KIF,"Please captain. I thank Leela for the DNA she gave me but in my species, the true parent is the one that inspired the initial feeling of love. We call that person the smizmar. And my smizmar is Amy."
12942,ZAPP,So the toilet seat is like the uncle or something?
12943,LEELA,Sorry I got your boyfriend pregnant.
12944,AMY,"That's OK, at least Kif's baby shower should be fun. I'd better put it on my calendar.  (to calendar) Thursday: Baby shower. Enter.  Might as well plan for my new life while I'm at it. (to calendar) Set Motherhood Mode."
12945,LEELA,To motherhood.
12946,AMY,"Mom, Dad, I know this is weird but -"
12947,MRS WONG,"Yeah yeah, we don't care how squishy alien get pregnant. All we care is we have grandchild now."
12948,KIF,You're very open-minded Mrs Wong.
12949,MR WONG,Hey! You call her grandma now!
12950,MRS WONG,Call me grandma like crazy! All the time!
12951,FRY,Check it out y'all. Everyone we invited is here.
12952,ZOIDBERG,Also Zoidberg!
12953,FRY,So lets open the gifts!
12954,KIF,Lets start with this one. From Bender.
12955,BENDER,It's my booties from when I was a kid.
12956,AMY,"Uh, they're already bronzed."
12957,BENDER,They are bronze.
12958,KIF,"And this one's from Leela, oh I just love the bow! I wonder what it is!"
12959,ZAPP,Yes I wonder what we got you.
12960,KIF,It's a basket! F-for picnics?
12961,LEELA,It means a lot to me. It's the basket my parents left me in at the Orphanarium.
12962,HERMES,You could use it for picnics.
12963,MRS WONG,Here Amy. We get this one for you.
12964,AMY,Is it a party board?
12965,MRS WONG,It's a board alright! An ironing board!
12966,MR WONG,We had your old party board converted now that you not be partying anymore.
12967,AMY,"You, you trashed my party board?"
12968,MRS WONG,"Damn right! Now you're a mom, the only surfing you do is under a big wave of responsibilty."
12969,KIF,Oh this is the happiest moment of my life! You all brought such wonderful gifts! But the greatest gift...
12970,BENDER,Mine!
12971,KIF,"...is the bond I share with my smizmar Amy. And soon, the quivvering mass of life within me will depend on us both. Even now I can sense it feeding, squirming, searching, questing and shortly, it will wren my loins into way and pull us down, down, down into the deep dark waters of commitment."
12972,ZOIDBERG,That's so beautiful!
12973,AMY (CRYING),"Yes, yes it's......no! I can't do this!"
12974,BENDER,Oh my God!
12975,KIF,Oh how could Amy leave me? When will women learn to take responsibilty for the children they've helped create? The quickening! My time is near. I must return to my homeworld to perform the ancient birthing rites.
12976,SCRUFFY,Lemme know how that turns out.
12977,KIF,I must now embark on a perilous journey. To give birth in precisely the same swamp I was born.
12978,LEELA,If it's so dangerous I'd better go with you. A gal has to protect her DNA.
12979,KIF,"No Leela. Tradition demands that I make this journey with my smizmar, and since Amy isn't here I must go it alone. Farewell. For we may never meet again."
12980,KIF,My scrapes feel a little better now.
12981,BENDER,"Hey, what's this fat ugly thing? A frog? A toad? Or your momma!"
12982,KIF,It's a poisonous froad! No one move.
12983,BENDER,I'm back baby!
12984,KIF,Behold. The sacred ancestral birthing grounds of my family.
12985,ZAPP,Smells like a jockstrap.
12986,MIDWIFE,I am the Grand Midwife.
12987,FRY,Hi!
12988,KIF,I am Kif of the clan Kroker. I come to bear my young.
12989,MIDWIFE,"Then let the Tea Of New Life be brewed. As it is written ""and both shall lift the jug together"". Where is your smizmar?"
12990,KIF,She's not with me.
12991,MIDWIFE,Oh the sorrow. Oh the shame. I'm sorry I'm probably just making you feel worse.
12992,KIF,As long as Amy is with me in my heart I will have the strength of two.  Apparently Amy hasn't been working out much lately.
12993,MIDWIFE,"As the tea boils please join hands with your beloved smizmar.  Oh right sorry, but I memorised the ceremony by heart and it mentions her a lot."
12994,KIF,I'll try to endure.
12995,MIDWIFE,Good 'cause I'm not changing it. Now turn ye to and gaze deeply into each other's eyes.
12996,BENDER,What are you looking at?
12997,MIDWIFE,"May the love I sense between you at this moment remain with you both for all your days.  The Tea Of New Life is ready. Let those who's love created this life speak each other's names, then drink."
12998,KIF,Amy.
12999,AMY (SHOUTING),Kif!
13000,KIF,Amy! Is it you or have I gone crazy with lonliness?
13001,BENDER,Both.
13002,AMY,"I still don't know if I'm ready for this but, I do know I love you. And I wanna be here beside you."
13003,MIDWIFE,Great! Now I lost my place! I'm starting over!
13004,KIF,Oh no time! It has begun!  Oh my!
13005,BENDER,Neat!
13006,AMY,You can do it Kif!
13007,KIF,Oh nearly!
13008,BENDER,Aww man!
13009,KIF,"Amy my love, tell me, are they making it to the water?"
13010,LEELA,Amy!
13011,AMY,Shoo! Stay away from my babies!
13012,MIDWIFE,The birthing is complete!
13013,KIF,Oh thank you!
13014,MIDWIFE,I will now take my leave. I live here so I won't actually be going anywhere but you don't have to talk to me anymore.
13015,FRY,Congratulations!
13016,ZAPP,Nice work!
13017,BENDER,Way to go squishy!
13018,LEELA,There goes my DNA. What a disgusting and beautiful process.
13019,FRY,That's birth for you.
13020,KIF,Well we've given them a great start Amy. And in 20 years they'll sprout legs and crawl back onto land as children.
13021,AMY,And I'll be ready then.
13022,THE END,
13023,"""LESS THAN HERO""",
13024,SEWERCOM ANNOUNCER,(Pleasant Female Voice) Your call is being (Gruff Alien Voice) connected (Pleasant Female Voice) by SewerCom - Reach out and touch the sewers.
13025,MUNDA [ON SCREEN],"Look Morris, it's Leela calling."
13026,LEELA,"Hi Mom, hi Dad! Ready for your big trip to the surface?"
13027,MORRIS [ON SCREEN],We're excited honey but we don't wanna embarrass you. I mean your mother and I are basically monsters.
13028,LEELA,"Dad, relax. You are being so mutant!"
13029,MUNDA [ON SCREEN],I found this adorable little bag to wear over my head.  And it was on sale!
13030,LEELA,"No one's wearing anything adorable over their head. Now listen, I could never ever be ashamed of my parents. I'll see you this weekend."
13031,LEELA,"Hey, guess who I just got off the videophone with?"
13032,BENDER,No.
13033,LEELA,My parents! They're coming up from the sewers for a visit Sunday.
13034,AMY,Are you off your rocket? Your parents are mutants. It's illegal for them to come above ground 'cause they're inferior genetic scum..uh present company excluded of course!
13035,LEELA,I'm getting them a special one-day surface permit from Citihall.
13036,HERMES,"Ooo, while you're there, could you pick me up a licence to kill?"
13037,LEELA,Sure. Bare hands or weapon?
13038,HERMES,"Uh, what does piano wire count as?"
13039,FARNSWORTH,"Good news anyone, the Swedish robot from pi-kea is here with the supercollider I ordered."
13040,PI-KEA ROBOT,Enjoy your affordable Swedish crap!
13041,FRY,"Let's see what tools we'll need.  Uh-huh, Uh-huh,  Uh-huh! Alright, we're all set."
13042,BENDER,Nothing like the rustic wholesomeness of working with one's own hand.
13043,BENDER,"Ah, there, finished. And with only six missing pieces!"
13044,FRY,Those Swedes sure know how to put in almost everything you need.
13045,LEELA,"Man, I'm sore all over. I feel like I just went ten rouns with Mighty Thor."
13046,FRY,I feel like I was mauled by Jesus.
13047,ZOIDBERG,"I've got just the thing, genuine miracle cream I bought from a travelling salesman. ""Come one come all,"" he said, ""Step right up!"" This sounds too good to be true I thought. He said I looked like a smart young man. ""So is it a deal?"" I enquired. Two hours later he was gone, with 60 of my dollars. But I have the miracle cream..."
13048,FARNSWORTH,"Bad news nobody, the supercollider super-exploded. I need you to take it back and exchanged it for a wobbly CD rack and some of those ransid meatballs."
13049,MUGGER,Excuse me? Hi! Do you have a minute? I live in Jersey City and my car broke down and I need to get back because my Aunt's real sick and she needs this medicine but I need money for the bus. So I'm mugging you. Hand over your wallets.
13050,LEELA,I don't believe that story for a second.
13051,MUGGER,"It doesn't matter, I'm mugging you."
13052,FRY,There's no bus to Jersey City.
13053,MUGGER,Give me your wallets now or my robot'll shoot.
13054,ANDREW,Don't make me hurt you.
13055,FRY,"I'm too scared to find my pocket. Here, I'll just take of my pants and give you those."
13056,MUGGER,Hey! I don't like what I'm seeing. Give it to him Andrew!  Give it to him again Andrew!  What the...? Laser proof shirts huh? I'll show you.
13057,LEELA,What the? Hey! Quit it!  Heyya!
13058,MUGGER,Foiled. And after years of planning.
13059,ANDREW,You're outta the game!
13060,LEELA,How did we manage to survive? What gave us those strange powers?
13061,FRY,Maybe we're all wearing magic rings but they're invisible rings so we don't even realise it. Also you can't feel the rings.
13062,LEELA,"Fry, shut up and look at this! (Reading) May cause superpowers in humans!"
13063,FRY,Wow! A superpowers drug you can just rub into your skin? You'd think it'd be something you have to freebase.
13064,LEELA,"Let's see, which powers do we have? Super-strength?"
13065,FRY,Yup.
13066,LEELA,Uh-huh. Lickety speed?
13067,FRY,Check.
13068,LEELA,Yes sir!  Ability to command a loyalty of sea creatures?
13069,FRY (SHOUTING),"Hey Zoidberg, get in here!"
13070,LEELA,Ain't got that.
13071,FRY,Nope!
13072,LEELA,"Wow, superpowers! I'll be able to pack my day with twice as many humdrum activity."
13073,FRY,"Leela, I think you're missing the big picture. When you were a kid what was your biggest fantasy?"
13074,LEELA,To have parents.
13075,FRY,Whatever. The correct answer is: To be a superhero. We have superpowers and we're Americans. This is our chance.
13076,LEELA,"Hmm, I have been looking for a way to serve the community that incorporates my violence. Let's do it!"
13077,FRY,You'll barely regret this!
13078,BENDER,"Hey, a friend of mine said he mugged you today and you had superpowers."
13079,LEELA,It's true. Thanks to this funky fresh cream.
13080,FRY,Now me and Leela are forming an awesome crime-fighting duo.
13081,BENDER,"Wow, crime-fighting. Cool. You say you're a duo? Yeah duos are good. Of course sometimes they're a little short handed. See ya. With two humans you'd think there'd be a robot in there...to balance things out. But, whatever.  I have these three costumes you could use. But, I guess I'll just throw one away."
13082,LEELA,We'd love to have you on the team Bender. But aren't you more on the supply side of crime?
13083,FRY,"Plus the cream won't give you superpowers, you're a robot."
13084,BENDER,So? I'm already super-strong. And my arms do this.  Also I got this going.
13085,LEELA (SHOUTING),Listen up New New York! There's a new group of superheros in town! And we're -
13086,LEELA,(shouting) Sorry! (whispering) A new era of justice has begun.
13087,FRY,Captain Yesterday!
13088,LEELA,Clobberella!
13089,BENDER,And Superking! The best one of the three!
13090,FRY,Wow!
13091,SONG,"Go Go New Justice Team,"
13092,SONG,"Clobberella beats you up,"
13093,SONG,"Citizens never fear,"
13094,BENDER,Ta-da!
13095,WOMAN (SEXFULLY),"Captain Yesterday, I find your skintight highwaters incredibly sexy! Let's get together sometime!"
13096,FRY,Sure. I'm listed in the phone book so once I reveal my real name to you along with my home address and a copy of my birth certificate -
13097,LEELA,Are you crazy?? We have to keep our secret identities secret.
13098,FRY,From everybody?
13099,LEELA,Especially from everybody.
13100,FRY,Give several reasons why.
13101,LEELA,"For one, superheroes cause a lot of collateral damage, and we don't wanna get our butts sued."
13102,FRY,Or do we...? No I guess not.
13103,LEELA,"Also, if our identities get out, every crook in the city will be after us. Or, God forbid, our loved ones."
13104,BENDER,Superking has no need for loved ones. How ya doin' kid?
13105,POOPENMEYER,There you go. Two one-day mutant surface passes.
13106,LEELA,Thank you Mayor Poopenmeyer.
13107,POOPENMEYER,Mayor here...what's that? Horrible crime in the works? Ruthless villain? Citizens in danger? That's fantastic news!  Because I get to summon The New Justice Team!
13108,LEELA,Shh!
13109,POOPENMEYER,"Uh, they're usually here by now."
13110,LEELA,"Well, so long. Keep in touch."
13111,POOPENMEYER,"Wait, stay and meet the superheroes. There's three of you and three of them so it'll be perfect.  Is this clown on? Where are those daring crimestoppers?"
13112,LEELA,"Oh, I completely forgot, I left my apartment on fire!"
13113,BENDER,"Uh, as for me, I'm late for my LSAT's."
13114,FRY,And I can't take life anymore.
13115,POOPENMEYER,Clobberella! Captain Yesterday! My liege! You're just in time!  We've received a tip that the Museum of Natural History will be robbed tomorrow at exactly 9am. The target: The priceless Quantum Gemerald!
13116,FRY,Who's the perp?
13117,POOPENMEYER,"A dangerous villain know as The Zookeeper, who commits crimes aided by a pack of highly trained animals."
13118,FRY,Pack of highly. Got it!
13119,POOPENMEYER,"His crew includes a badger with a troubled past and nothing left to lose, an elephant who never forgets - to kill! And a seldom used crab named Lucky aka Citizen Snips."
13120,LEELA,You can count on us Mr Mayor! Justice away!
13121,BENDER (GASPING),Hold the elevator!
13122,BENDER,We're in here too.
13123,FRY,"Uh, Leela, how you gonna meet your folks tomorrow? We've already scheduled the Zookeeper for a 9am foiling at the museum."
13124,LEELA,Not a problem. I've cleverly arranged to meet my parents right there at the same museum at 10.
13125,BENDER,"9, 10 a big fat hen.  The name...Bender!"
13126,LEELA,I can't believe the Zookeeper is this late for his own heist. It's just rude! Total hell! It's 10! I'm supposed to meet my parents and I'm still in my secret costume!  There they are!
13127,MUNDA,How could Leela not be here? Do you think she forgot?
13128,MORRIS,Relax. I'm sure she's just ashamed of us.
13129,SECURITY GUARD,Yo! Freakjobs! Hit the nearest manhole! Pronto like.
13130,MORRIS,But we have passes that allow us to be up here. From the mayor himself.
13131,SECURITY GUARD,I dunno...I never heard of no mayor.
13132,RANDY,The Zookeeper!
13133,ZOOKEEPER,"Sorry I'm late, long story. Now everybody hit the deck! I'm cutting the entire line and stealing the exhibit."
13134,LEELA,You're not stealing anything! Nobody hit the deck!
13135,ZOOKEEPER,"Ah, superheroes! Or should I say superzeroes!"
13136,FRY (SADLY),That was uncalled for.
13137,ZOOKEEPER,"Animals, attack."
13138,TOUR GUIDE,Please to not feed the animals!
13139,BENDER,You're going down my friend! Down Under!
13140,TEDDY ROOSEVELT,Man boxing a kangaroo is a peculiar spectacle. But a kangaroo boxing a robot? Now I'm afraid you've lost me!  (shouting) Citizen Snips!
13141,ZOOKEEPER,Nice job Fingers!
13142,MUNDA,I'm scared and confused. I think we've wandered into an off-Broadway play.
13143,MORRIS,No there are way too many people here.
13144,ZOOKEEPER,"Later, if anyone asks how I got away, tell them right now!"
13145,LEELA,Forget it Zookeeper! You're going into captivity!
13146,ZOOKEEPER,Fool! A quip without putting me behind bars would have been far more delicious! Here catch!
13147,LEELA,"No, Fry you can't fall fast enough!"
13148,BENDER,I got it I got it!  I don't got it!
13149,TEDDY ROOSEVELT,You've saved the Gemerald!
13150,FRY,Yet the Zookeeper escaped. Thus proving that the deadliest animal of all is the Zookeeper!
13151,BENDER,You can get off me anytime.
13152,LEELA,Oh no! My parents are leaving! I've gotta go change back into street-Leela.
13153,POOPENMEYER,Thank you mysterious heroes. The value of the Gemerald you saved is slightly greater than the cost of the damage you caused to this museum. A net gain for our great city!
13154,MUNDA,It's good that Leela doesn't love us. She'll be less sad when we die.
13155,LEELA,Mom? Dad? I showed up! And I got the audio tour for Treasures Of Liberachi's Tomb!
13156,MORRIS,"Sweetie, it's OK. You don't have to apologise for standing us up on the only visit to the surface we'll ever have."
13157,LEELA,I wanna tell you why I didn't show up. But I can't. Just please believe me that it was a very good reason. I'm sorry I disappointed you.
13158,MUNDA,"Leela, you could never disappoint us."
13159,MORRIS,We're so proud of everything that you are. And we always will be. You're our baby girl.
13160,LEELA,"Oh, I can't take it! Mom, Dad, I'm Clobberella!"
13161,MORRIS,Galloping gators!
13162,MUNDA,You're a superhero?  Well that's wonderful! But did you have to make the costume so revealing?
13163,MORRIS,Look at me! Proud dad of a superhero! We should print up T-Shirts! And F-Shirts for our friends with two arms on the same side!
13164,LEELA,"No, listen. It's very important that you never ever tell anyone. Under any circumstance."
13165,MORRIS,What if I've had a few?
13166,LEELA,"Dad, you drink? No. Not even then."
13167,MORRIS,Alright. My sucker is sealed.
13168,LEELA,"In fact, I shouldn't even be wearing this around here.  It was brisk, I dressed in layers."
13169,MUNDA,That's my girl!
13170,MORRIS,"So uh, anyway, my daughter's Clobberella."
13171,RAOUL,Leela is Clobberella?
13172,LEG MUTANT,You're pulling me!
13173,MORRIS,"Shh, keep it under your sock. It's a big secret. That's why I'm only telling you two."
13174,BIG EARED MUTANT,Oh my God! That guy's daughter is Clobberella! But don't tell anyone.
13175,BIG MOUTHED MUTANT,Gotcha!
13176,FARNSWORTH,"I don't remember much buddy, and you're no looker!"
13177,LEELA,"Uh Professor, isn't it time for your nap?"
13178,FARNSWORTH,Yes dammit!
13179,LEELA,Zookeeper! How did you know our real identities?
13180,PARROT [ON SCREEN],Leela told her parents. Leela's parents blabbed.
13181,FRY,"Leela, is the person that parrot is mimicking telling the truth by proxy?"
13182,LEELA (SADLY),"Yes. My parents were so hurt, I couldn't help it! (angry) But I distinctly told them not to tell anyone."
13183,BENDER,We are not amused.
13184,LEELA,Mom! Dad!
13185,MUNDA [ON SCREEN],Leela please forgive us! Especially your father who's the one who told thank you very much Morris.
13186,LEELA,Are you alright? Has he hurt you?
13187,MORRIS [ON SCREEN],No but my allergies are going nuts. Oh God!
13188,MUNDA [ON SCREEN],Every couch and table has animal fur all over it. He lets them climb on everything!
13189,LEELA,"Alright Zookeeper, what do you want?"
13190,MUNDA [ON SCREEN],Save us Leela! I mean...if you don't have anything better to do.
13191,LEELA,We're out of options. We have to steal the Gemerald!
13192,FRY,"But, should superheroes commit crime? Even to save lives? I need moral guidance. Bender?"
13193,BENDER,"Hmm, the thought of stealing anythig fills Superking with disgust. But if it must be so, then let a museum heist be pulled!"
13194,FRY,Oh no! Our superpower cream is out of itself!
13195,LEELA,Check inside the cap! There might be a caked in goldmine!
13196,FRY,El zilcho! I'm afraid we're boned.
13197,BENDER,El zilcho...is it too late to change my superhero name?
13198,LEELA,Just be cool. Nobody knows we're superpowerly challenged.
13199,FRY,"Man, this costume is so damn heavy!"
13200,KID,"Hey Captain Yesterday, can I like, wail on you with this 2x4 and it doesn't hurt you?"
13201,FRY,Owww! That...didn't hurt.
13202,SECURITY GUARD,"Hi superheroes, everything OK?"
13203,LEELA,"Big O, little k my friend! Just checking if everything's alright!"
13204,SECURITY GUARD,It's OK alright!
13205,LEELA,OK then. Grab it!
13206,BUBBLEGUM TATE,"Yo, the superheroes have turned evil! Most uncool!"
13207,SECURITY GUARD,Get 'em!
13208,LEELA,"Stay back! Or we'll, beat the tour out of you...using superpowers!"
13209,FRY,So this is your lair?
13210,ZOOKEEPER,Of course not. You think I'd show you my lair? My lair's a million times nicer than this!
13211,FRY,"OK, take it easy!"
13212,BENDER,"Well, here's your lousy Gemerald."
13213,ZOOKEEPER,Hawk! Fetch!
13214,FRY,That seemed unnecessary.
13215,ZOOKEEPER,"Our transaction is complete. Come Solomon, to the lair."
13216,LEELA,"Mom, Dad, oh I'm so sorry I got you kidnapped by a crazy madman who tried to feed you to pirhanas."
13217,MUNDA,We're just happy to be involved in your life.
13218,LEELA,"No no, it's my fault for telling you I was a superhero."
13219,MORRIS,That's true.
13220,LEELA,I just couldn't stand to have you to think I was ashamed of you.
13221,MUNDA,"That's OK sweetie, but, it's natural for children to be a little ashamed of their parents."
13222,FRY,Oh yeah!
13223,MORRIS,Just like it's natural for parents to be a little disappointed in their children...n-not that we are.
13224,MUNDA,But you could call a little more often.
13225,LEELA,
13226,MUNDA,And would it kill you to use some mouthwash?
13227,BENDER,Hey Fry we've still got our costumes on. Wanna steal some more stuff?
13228,FRY,"I guess, as long as you think it's right."
13229,BENDER,Superheroes away!
13230,SONG,Go go go New Justice Team!

13233,FARNSWORTH,Pazuzu you ungrateful gargoyle! I put you through college and this is how you repay me?
13234,FARNSWORTH,"Let's get this gargoyle hunt on the road. Driving gloves, driving goggles. Driving thong. There."
13235,LEELA,"Uh, maybe I should drive."
13236,FARNSWORTH,You? A woman? I'm trying to catch a monster not find the quickest route to the mall! Let me just adjust the seat.
13237,FRY,"My God, he's gonna do it! Everybody, seatbelts to maximum buckling."
13238,RANDY [FROM HIS CAR],"Hey grandpa, move your wrinkly old kiester!"
13239,LEELA,For heaven's gate Professor this ship can do 99% light speed. Why are we going at 35 miles an hour?
13240,FARNSWORTH,Because we're in a hurry that's why.
13241,LEELA,Plus you have the highbeams on!
13242,BENDER,"Yo, Captain Cateracts, what are we doing here?"
13243,FARNSWORTH,"Oh it's 2:30, we can still catch the early bird dinner special."
13244,FRY,"Uh, aren't we looking for your gargoyle?"
13245,FARNSWORTH,My wha?
13246,FARNSWORTH,Hello Mavis! Surprised to see me back again so soon?
13247,WANDA,Mavis is dead.
13248,FARNSWORTH,I expect you'll want to see my angry crotchety grandpa discount card!
13249,WANDA,Sir this card is expired.
13250,FARNSWORTH,But it's good for a lifetime.
13251,WANDA,Well yours expired.
13252,LEELA,Oh Lord! Teeth do not belong in your pants Professor.
13253,FARNSWORTH,Well I can't keep them in my mouth. They're nuclear powered!
13254,FRY,Ow! It bit me!
13255,LEELA,No! No! It's tasted human blood!
13256,FARNSWORTH,Mmm! Damn good meat!
13257,LEELA,Professor we've talked it over and everyone thinks you're too old.
13258,AMY,Right on.
13259,FRY,Yup.
13260,BENDER,Uh huh!
13261,HERMES,We've decided to do the merciful thing and have you Youthasized.
13262,FARNSWORTH,Dear God no!
13263,AMY,"Oh relax Professor. Youthasizing is a trendy new spa treatment, its this seasons shark cartilage enema."
13264,FARNSWORTH,"But I like being old. I don't have to talk to my parents, no one asks me to help move their stuff, I don't need to understand today's ""edgy TV sitcoms."""

13269,HEATHER,Oh!  In small doses botchelism toxin tightens and tones the facial muscles instead of killing you in the most horrible fashion imaginable.
13270,FARNSWORTH,Give me back my floppy face!
13271,FARNSWORTH,Careful with the giblets!
13272,HEATHER,"Hmm, you're still retaining a lot of grump in these joints.  More pressure."
13273,FARNSWORTH,Ahh!
13274,HEATHER,"Since this is such a serious case of old, we'll have to try our strongest treatment. A soothing full body bath in searing hot tar. Sir, its not neccesary or wise to be naked."
13275,FARNSWORTH,You sound just like my tennis instructor.
13276,HEATHER,The tar blisters the age right out of the body in what top scientists suspect is a miracle.
13277,FARNSWORTH,"Oh I don't have time for this. I have to go and buy a single piece of fruit with a coupon and then return it, making people wait behind me while I complain."
13278,FRY,He still sounds sorta old. Sorta real old.
13279,BENDER,"Step aside lady.  Like everything else in life, pumping is just a primative degenerate form of bending. (mean voice) C'mon Bender pump harder! Harder! (weak voice) I'm trying as hard as I can. (mean voice) Harder damn you!"
13280,FARNSWORTH,Well that was an utter waste of time.
13281,AMY,Professor it worked! You look young enough to be my father!
13282,FARNSWORTH,Poodlespit!  53 years old?  Now I'll need a fake ID to rent ultra-porn.
13283,FRY,This is great Professor! We should go out and celebrate!
13284,FARNSWORTH,"Dear Lord, you've all reverted to your childhood forms!"
13285,ZOIDBERG,Hooray! I'm a teenage hearthrob again!
13286,FARNSWORTH,"While I try to restore our normal ages, I expect you all to go about your jobs like normal professionals."
13287,HERMES,"It wasn't me Mr F, it was Amy!  Stop it Amy!"
13288,AMY,You stink!
13289,HERMES,You know you did it!
13290,FARNSWORTH,Quiet! Quiet I say!
13291,LABARBARA,"We're here to take my little stub of a husband home. Hermes, say goodbye to Mr Farnsworth."
13292,HERMES,Goodbye Mr Dumbsworth!
13293,LEELA,"Hey, this my chance to spend time with my parents too!"
13294,FRY,But your parents are gross sewer mutants.
13295,LEELA,"When I was an orphan I always wished I could grow up with my mom and dad. And now, thanks to being hurled backwards through time -"
13296,FARNSWORTH,That's not what happened! Shut up and go live with your parents.
13297,LEELA,"It's gonna be totally awesome mom! You and me can bake and argue about my hairstyle hiding my pretty face. And if some kid picks on me, my dad can beat up his dad."
13298,MORRIS,Can't I just beat up the kid?
13299,MUNDA,"Well OK Leela, if you think you can put up with your father, welcome home. We'll try to respect your independence and your freedom."
13300,LEELA,"No! I want the real teen experience! Chores, curfew, the works!"
13301,MORRIS,"Fine Leela we'll be the strictest parents ever. Now, lets all have some tequila to celebrate!"
13302,LEELA,Dad I'm underage!
13303,MORRIS,Oh right. Here's a silly straw.
13304,MRS WONG,Oh my Amy's sweet little girl again. This like a mother's dream. Bad dream that is! At this rate I'm never going to get a grandchild!
13305,MR WONG,Maybe she not grown up but she sure grown out! She fat!
13306,AMY,"Dad, if you're gonna make fat jokes until I get cute again I'm just gonna stay in my room."
13307,MR WONG,Stay in room? You so fat you gonna stay all around room!
13308,FARNSWORTH,I've got to find a way to escape the horrible ravages of youth! Suddenly I'm going to the bathroom like clockwork every three hours! And those jerks at social security stopped sending me cheques! Now I have to pay them!
13309,BENDER,"I'm tired of your yapping.  All you ever do is complain, you never try to make things better. Well I'm running away from this dead end family! I know there's a place for people like me with new ideas. There has to be!"
13310,FARNSWORTH,"Fine, get going!"
13311,BENDER,"Oh I'm going! You're gonna be all ""Where's Bender? I miss Bender!"""
13312,FARNSWORTH,We won't know that until you leave.
13313,BENDER,"Oh, I'm leaving!"
13314,FARNSWORTH,There's the door.
13315,BENDER,I'll be good.
13316,MUNDA,"Ah, do you have to shed your skin on the couch? What do we live in, a zoo?"
13317,MORRIS,I'm getting the doorbell.  For me?
13318,FRY,"Oh, hello sir. It's a lovely evening you have tonight. Um I'm here to pick up your daughter."
13319,LEELA,Hi Fry! I like your blazer.
13320,FRY,Thanks. These aren't pockets they're just flaps. I put my money in my sock.
13321,MUNDA,"So, where are you taking my daughter tonight?"
13322,FRY,A movie.  A movie ma'am.
13323,MORRIS,"Well whatever you're really doing, don't wake us if you get in after 12."
13324,LEELA,"Dad, you're being too leaneant again! I have to be back by 11."
13325,MUNDA,OK OK you're the boss!
13326,LEELA,No I'm not!
13327,FRY,I'd like a sewer burger but without the rat feces.
13328,LEELA,What are you on a diet?
13329,MOOSE,Uh Leela you look hot!
13330,MANDY,"Jeez Moose, just dump me right in front of her why don't you!"
13331,LEELA,"Moose, Mandy, this is my friend Fry - from the surface!"
13332,MANDY,Oh so this is the famous Fry! What is he like the biggest loser on the surface so he has to hang out in the sewer?
13333,FRY (WHISPERING),They're onto me.
13334,LEELA,"Hey come on, let's act like grown ups here! Wanna race?"
13335,MOOSE,Uh yeah!
13336,SAL,Theres. The worlds drinkings water is safes for another days.  Whoas!  Cripe!
13337,LEELA,A tapeworm!
13338,FRY,"We missed the turn, we'll never catch them."
13339,LEELA,Yes we will. This sewer goes right under Planet Express and its's 9pm!
13340,FRY,Yeah!
13341,LEELA,All right!
13342,FRY,"Leela you can stop winning now, we won!"
13343,LEELA,I'm too short to reach the handbrake!
13344,DWAYNE,That's detention!
13345,FRY,"And then, and then, this giant tapeworm tried to play us for chumps but we like totally dissed Moose!"
13346,FARNSWORTH,"Yes, I'd like to meet this ""moose."" But in the meantime I have good news. I may have solved our age problem."
13347,FRY,Yay!
13348,FARNSWORTH,"It seems the Youthasizer tar was saturated with time-altering chronitons. A thin layer is still stuck to our DNA as well as Bender's Robot DNA or ""RNA."""
13349,BENDER,Question.
13350,FARNSWORTH,Yes?
13351,BENDER,You stink!
13352,FARNSWORTH,Yes yes. Anyhow I've designed an oil eating bacterium that should take the tar right off.
13353,FRY,C'mon! Lets go tell Leela so we can grow up together!
13354,LEELA,Thanks Professor but I don't want the treatment.
13355,FARNSWORTH,"Don't you understand you little nitwit? Unless you're treated soon, the only way to restore your true age would be to grow into it! Just as God intended."
13356,MUNDA,He has a point honey. What about your job and your friends? Do you really want to abandon your old life?
13357,LEELA,My old life wasn't as glamourous as my webpage made it look. All I ever wanted was to grow up here. With you. Please?
13358,MUNDA,Well if it's what you really want.
13359,LEELA,It is. I know it is.
13360,FRY,I'll miss you Leela. I'll come ack and visit when I'm all grown up.
13361,LEELA (WHISPERING),Bring beer.
13362,MORRIS,No beer 'til you finish your tequila!
13363,AMY,Let's go!
13364,FARNSWORTH,Initiating controlled infection.
13365,ZOIDBERG,I'm no doctor but this machine guy could use a lozenge.
13366,AMY,Aw poo! We're even younger!
13367,FARNSWORTH,"Damn! the bacteria pigged out on the tar and now they're getting freaky deaky, spreading chronitons throughout our systems. We're getting younger by the minute!"
13368,ZOIDBERG,What I'm going to revrt through all my larval stages?
13369,FARNSWORTH,Word! We'll all keep getting younger and younger until we suffer a fate worse than death - pre-life! Then death.
13370,FARNSWORTH,I've got to stop this reverse aging before we all shrivel up and suffer the agony of unbirth. Think you disco duck think!
13371,AMY,What's that squirming under your shirt?
13372,FARNSWORTH,Get off me you parasitic lamprey!
13373,ZOIDBERG,Oh sure like you need all your blood.
13374,FARNSWORTH,Would you all chill! I can't think with you kids cramping my style! Oh I need a babysitter!
13375,LEELA,"OK, quiet time. I know, everyone pretend to THING TO CHECK your tongue and I'll read you a story."
13376,ZOIDBERG,I can't see from down here I can't.
13377,LEELA,There. Todays story is from New Teen magazine. What would you rather hear about? Four legged Chachi or tentacled Chachi?
13378,FRY,I wanna hear a space story!
13379,LEELA,"It's kind of a baby book. But OK. Let's see. Snow White Dwarf And The Seven Red Dwarves, Charlotte's Tholian Web, The Fountain Of Aging."
13380,FARNSWORTH,"The Fountain Of Aging? Hmm, it is just a legend. Still, they called the Tooth Fairy a legend and now it's head of the FBI."
13381,FARNSWORTH,Sup? Kids ready?
13382,FRY,"Professy's back!  Eww, you smell like smoking.  And drinking."
13383,FARNSWORTH,I had a few beers but I'm cool to drive.
13384,LEELA,"I wish I could come with you to say goodbye, before you all turn back in to grown ups but I'm grounded for knocking the school over."
13385,MUNDA,"Who cares Leela? It was just a public school. Now go with your friends, please."
13386,LEELA,No! A grounded teenager must be confined to her room!
13387,LEELA,...until she sneaks out!
13388,BENDER,When I grow up I wanna be a steam shovel!
13389,LEELA,"According to this, the fountain is located within the darkest, most ancient region of space, just past teddybear junction."
13390,FARNSWORTH,"Teddybear junction, the worst scum hole in the galaxy."
13391,FARNSWORTH,This solar system is like way old.
13392,LEELA,Look how high the asteroid belt is pulled up on that planet.
13393,FARNSWORTH,Newsflash! Everything's getting older the closer we get to that sun!
13394,LEELA,"Dude, the Fountain Of Aging must be on the sun itself!"
13395,FARNSWORTH,Shut up! I was gonna say that!
13396,LEELA,We've got to hurry. The kids have only one change of pants!
13397,FARNSWORTH,We gotta be real real careful to stay in just long enough to make us our right ages again.
13398,FARNSWORTH,Zoidberg! Get out of there!
13399,ZOIDBERG,"The current, its too much already! Help!"
13400,FARNSWORTH,Jeepers!
13401,LEELA,Zoidberg is dead!
13402,ZOIDBERG,No! Zoidberg's brother is dead!  funny story. I just reverted to the age where my siblings budded from me and my brother Norman split off and jumped in the fountain.
13403,SIBLING,He always had to be the centre of attention!
13404,LEELA,Oh no!  Quick! Get them into the fountain!
13405,FARNSWORTH,Thanks for the help Weewa. Once we're gwown up you can go back to your famiwy. We'wl never bother you again.
13406,LEELA,You can bother me a little.
13407,FARNSWORTH,It's working! Hooray!  I can't hold on!
13408,LEELA,I'm coming in after you!
13409,FARNSWORTH,No Leela! You can't give up your childhood! You'll never have another chance at it!
13410,FRY,We did it! We're the right ages again!
13411,LEELA,I think I might be a couple years younger.
13412,AMY,"Oh, me too!"
13413,LEELA,He's too far out! We can't reach him!
13414,HERMES,Are you back to your original age Professor?
13415,FARNSWORTH,Even older! Huzzah!
13416,FRY,I'm sorry you had to give up being a kid Leela.
13417,LEELA,"Well, I guess ever adult wants to be a kid sometimes. But I worked hard to be the person I am!"
13418,FRY,The fabulous person!
13419,LEELA,With friends like you guys -
13420,FRY,Fabulous friends!
13421,LEELA,And I'm really happy I have that life back.
13422,FARNSWORTH,And you my faithful fiend! How can I ever repay you?
13423,THE END,
13424,"""THE WHY OF FRY""",
13425,FRY,Delivery boy Philip J. Fry reporting for duty.
13426,ZOIDBERG,"Dr Zoidberg, soaking in brine."
13427,FRY,"What is the meaning of this? We've got a delivery people, let's move, let's move!  Amy? Mission profile?  Interesting, interesting. Dr Zoidberg, mission bag?"
13428,ZOIDBERG,Packed and ready sir.
13429,FRY,What's this? This is the same toy surprise I got last time!  I can't work under these conditions. And without me there is no mission. I am the mission!
13430,LEELA (SHOUTING),We're back from the mission!
13431,FRY,Wh-what? You went without me?
13432,BENDER (SHOUTING),You were looking up curse words in the dictionary. It seemed like a better use of your time.
13433,FRY,"But, but I'm the delivery boy."
13434,LEELA,"Don't worry, everything went fine."
13435,BENDER,Better than usual!
13436,LEELA,We got medals! Good work team! We really pulled together on this one.
13437,BENDER,Woo-hoo!
13438,FRY,I'm real sorry I missed the mission. I wasn't there and you might have needed me.
13439,BENDER,Nope.
13440,FRY,But if I'd been there I -
13441,BENDER,Nope.
13442,FRY,
13443,BENDER,Nope.
13444,FRY,Bender's great.
13445,BENDER,Nope! Ohh!
13446,FRY,"Listen Leela, let me make it up by taking you out to dinner tonight."
13447,LEELA,Nope. I've got a date with Chaz.
13448,FRY,Chaz?
13449,LEELA,I met him at that charity cock fight last week. He's the mayor's aide.
13450,BENDER,"Ooo, you go mutant girl!"
13451,LEELA,I do go! He's a very important man.
13452,FRY,"So? I'm just as important as him.  It's just that, the kind of importance I have, it doesn't matter if I...don't do it."
13453,FRY,I'm nobody. There are guys in the background with Mary Worth comics who are more important than me.
13454,BENDER,"Ah, buck up meatloaf. Bender'll take you out tonight and cheer you up. What do you wanna do? And I mean anything. You have the power! Name it an I'm there, you the man!"
13455,FRY,"Um, OK. Let's go bowling."
13456,BENDER,Nah.
13457,ELZAR,Table for two? Step right this way.
13458,CHAZ,"I'm afraid we don't have a reservation but uh, as you can see......I'm the mayor's aide. Table for two please."
13459,ELZAR,OK then.
13460,ELZAR,Bam!
13461,CHAZ,It's OK my man. I got you covered on your next health inspection.
13462,ELZAR,"I really appreciate that mister mayor's aide.  Here you go, compliments of the house."
13463,LEELA,"Wow, free bread at a restaurant? Is there anything you can't do?"
13464,CHAZ,"I can't fail the mayor, not ever."
13465,FRY,"Oh jeez, better not let Leela see me."
13466,LEELA,"Hey, I hear Fry.  Boy am I glad you're here!"
13467,FRY,You are? So things aren't working out with whatshisname?
13468,LEELA,"Actually...they are! Confidentially, I might not make it back to my apartment tonight! Could you walk Nibbler for me?"
13469,FRY,Um..uh...
13470,LEELA,And bring a baggy in case he drops a steamer. (shouting) Have a great night!
13471,FRY,"Oh no, please, no!  Perfect!"
13472,SMITTY,"Whoa, smells like a 289 in progress!"
13473,URL,"Failure to scoop, aw yeah!"
13474,FRY,"Wait, I'm trying. It weighs as much as a thousand suns!"
13475,CHAZ,"Don't worry Fry, I'll pull some strings. See if I can't get you tried as a juvenile!"
13476,LEELA,Oh Chaz!
13477,FRY,I'm as worthless as this trashcan.
13478,TRASHCAN,You think I'm as worthless as you? Try catching garbage in your head and raising six kids you dumb townie!
13479,FRY,"Oh Nibbler, at least I'm important to you. Even if it's only 'cause I clean up you poop."
13480,NIBBLER,The poop eradication is but one aspect of your importance.
13481,FRY,D-d-did you just talk?
13482,NIBBLER,Indeed. And I have other amazing powers as well.
13483,FRY,Like what?
13484,FRY,Are you my mommy?
13485,NIBBLER,Negative.
13486,FIONA,Welcome Lord Nibbler.
13487,NIBBLER,Welcome acknowledged. I bring with me...the Mighty One.
13488,FRY,Eh?
13489,KEN,"At last, our centuries upon centuries of waiting have achieved fruition."
13490,FRY,"Aww, aren't you a fuzzy wittle guy?"
13491,KEN,Stop that! Uh...please. Your mightiness -
13492,FRY,Mightiness? Are you off your nut? I just got kidnapped by a bunch of guineapigs.
13493,KEN,Does he not know?
13494,NIBBLER,He does not know.
13495,FIONA,He knows not?
13496,NIBBLER,Knows not does he.
13497,NIBBLONIAN,Not he knows?
13498,KEN,"Enough! Fry, it is my duty to inform you that the fate of humanity, the fate of our race, indeed the fate of all that exists and all that will exist rests with you. You are the single most important person in the universe."
13499,FRY,Oh snap!
13500,NIBBLER,"On this auspicious occasion, let the Hall Of Eternity cut a thunderous blast."
13501,FIONA,The Feast Of A Thousand Beasts is begun.
13502,NIBBLONIAN,You gonna eat that?
13503,FRY,Maybe later.
13504,KEN,The time has come to discuss matters of the gravest importance.
13505,NIBBLER,"Fry, do you remember some months ago when the Earth was attacked by flying brains?"
13506,FRY,"Hmm, I remember the square dancing stomachs, although that might have been a milanta commerical. Wait! The brains! I do remember! But no one else does. They said I was crazy."
13507,KEN,On the contrary. You remember beause you were the only one immune to the brain's mental attack.
13508,FRY,Because I'm so smart?
13509,KEN,"Oh my. Anyway, your immunity is due to the fact that you lack the delta brainwave.  It's a genetic abnormality which resulted when you went back in time and performed certain actions which made you your own grandfather."
13510,FRY,I did do the nasty in the pasty!
13511,NIBBLER,Verily. And that past nastification is what shields you from the brains. You are the last hope of the universe.
13512,FRY,So I really am important? How I feel when I'm drunk is correct?
13513,KEN,Yes. Except the Dave Matthews Band doesn't rock.
13514,KEN,"For a thousand years, the evil brains have been constructing the giant Infosphere, a giant memory bank twice the size of three ordinary memory banks."
13515,FRY,What's so evil about that?
13516,FIONA,They plan to collect all the information in the universe and store it in the sphere.
13517,FRY,So they're trying to learn things?
13518,FIONA,Right.
13519,FRY,Those bastards!
13520,NIBBLER,"Being brains, they feel compelled to know everything. And soon they will."
13521,FRY,I'm as mad as I've ever been.
13522,KEN,"Once their task is complete, they will ensure no new information arises in the only way possible: by destroying the universe."
13523,FRY,Now it's personal.
13524,FIONA,"Your mission is to infiltrate the Infosphere and plant this quantum-interphase bomb, blasting them into an alternate universe, from which there is no return."
13525,NIBBLER,Then outrun the blast on this Scooty-Puff Jr.
13526,FRY,"OK, let's go through this once more -"
13527,FRY,Aah! Brains!
13528,KEN [ON SCREEN],"Fear not Mighty One, your missing brainwave makes you invisible to them. So long as you avoid intense thinking."
13529,FRY,"Sorry, what? I wasn't paying attention."
13530,KEN [ON SCREEN],That is most wise.
13531,FRY,Who?
13532,KEN [ON SCREEN],In a few seconds the brains will finish scanning the last bits of information in the universe.
13533,KEN [ON SCREEN],"Now the Infosphere will open it's protective crust so as to scan itself, completing it's thousand year task."
13534,FIONA [ON SCREEN],This is your one chance to enter the sphere! Scoot! Scoot now!
13535,FRY,I'm at the input console. I'm a little nervous and I've got brain in my buttcrack.
13536,NIBBLER [ON SCREEN],Roger.
13537,KEN [ON SCREEN],"Once you press the detonator, you will have 60 seconds for an exciting escape."
13538,FRY,"Hey wait, this brain knows everything about everything right?"
13539,KEN [ON SCREEN],It will soon. That's why you're supposed to be setting off a bomb.
13540,FRY,"Yeah yeah, but I can't pass up a chance to learn the answers to the greatest questions of all time.  Is it true that post-it stamp glue is made up of -"
13541,INFOSPHERE BRAIN,Correct. Toad mucus.
13542,KEN [ON SCREEN],There's no time for this. Activate the bomb.
13543,FRY,Wait wait wait.  What really killed the dinosaurs?
13544,INFOSPHERE BRAIN,Me!
13545,COMPUTER VOICE,Unauthorised Data Access.
13546,FRY,Uh oh.
13547,GIANT BRAIN,Detecting trace amounts of mental activity. Possibly a dead weasel or a cartoon viewer.
13548,FRY,Eww gross. Cut it out!
13549,BRAIN #1,Odd. He is immune to our sionic attack.
13550,BRAIN #2,Impossible. We're an ambitious young squad with everything to prove.
13551,GIANT BRAIN,"It appears we are in the presence of the fabled one. But without his Scooty-Puff Jr, he cannot escape.  Huh?"
13552,BRAIN #2,A quantum-interphase bomb? Are you insane in the membrane?
13553,FRY,You got it poindexter!
13554,BRAIN #1,"Oh, not good!"
13555,COMPUTER VOICE,Detonation in T-60 Earth seconds.
13556,BRAIN #3,You fool. You'll be transported to the other universe with us. Trapped there for all eternity.
13557,BRAIN #1,"And we'll form a tightly-knit clique, that you won't be part of!"
13558,FRY,Well at least I did one important thing with my life. Leading good to victory over evil!
13559,KEN [ON SCREEN],Exactly!
13560,GIANT BRAIN,The Nibblonians? Good? During your last moments in this universe perhaps you should query our database concerning the night of December 31st 1999.
13561,FRY,The day I got frozen? What about it?
13562,NIBBLER [ON SCREEN],"No! Don't ask about that! It, it would be uh...boring!"
13563,FRY,Eh forget it then.
13564,GIANT BRAIN,Query!
13565,FRY,"OK sheesh!  What happened to me, Philip J. Fry, on the night of December 31st 1999?"
13566,INFOSPHERE BRAIN,Clarification request. Are you the Philip J. Fry from Earth or the Philip J. Fry from Hovering Squidworld 97A?
13567,GIANT BRAIN,Earth you fat idiot! Hurry up!
13568,FRY [ON SCREEN],Hello? Pizza delivery for uh...I. C. Wiener? Aw crud!
13569,FRY,"Eurgh! I can't believe how fat I look! Aw, Nibbler's there. Wait! What?!"
13570,FRY [ON SCREEN],What the?
13571,FRY,"I, I don't understand. You made me go in the freezer tube?"
13572,COMPUTER VOICE,Detonation in T-15 seconds.
13573,FRY,You little runts froze me! You took away my life!
13574,NIBBLER [ON SCREEN],We can explain!
13575,FRY,No you can't. Shut your adorable trap!
13576,NIBBLER [ON SCREEN],We had no choice. You were the only one who could help us. What is one life weighed against the entire universe?
13577,FRY (CRYING),But it was my life.
13578,COMPUTER VOICE,"Detonation in 2, 1. Will the owner of a white Pontiac Firebird...oh nevermind. Zero!"
13579,GIANT BRAIN,"Well, here we are. Trapped for eternity."
13580,BRAIN #2,We could sing American Pie.
13581,FRY,Go ahead. I deserve it. I wish those stupid racoons had never brought me to the future.
13582,INFOSPHERE BRAIN,I have shocking data relevant to this conversation.
13583,GIANT BRAIN,"We don't care you dope! We're in another universe, you're not in charge anymore."
13584,INFOSPHERE BRAIN,It is possible for the Philip Fry to resume his life on December 31st 1999.
13585,FRY,Really? I can go back in time?
13586,INFOSPHERE BRAIN,"There is a nexus point between universes, at the space-time you entered the cryogenic tube. You and only you can return there."
13587,GIANT BRAIN,Interesting. You could stop the Nibblonian from pushing you into the cryogenic tube.
13588,FRY,That is interesting. Why?
13589,GIANT BRAIN,It would be as if you never came to the future. You will have your life back and we will suceed in our plan to understand and destroy the universe.
13590,FRY,Everybody wins!
13591,BRAIN #2,The human will be returned to the past!
13592,NARRATOR,Meanwhile...
13593,LEELA,I love rocket skating! But the wait is always so long. Fry once stood in line for six hours just to get me a ticket.
13594,CHAZ,Six hours? Pfft. Sounds like a real nobody! But now it's time for somebody and some chick he's with to go skating.
13595,LEELA,You reserved the whole rink?
13596,CHAZ,"Yup. Buzzed ahead, let 'em know who's aide was coming by. The mayor's, that's who's."
13597,LEELA,Oh Chaz!
13598,SALLY,Mr Vogel. I thought we was going skating.
13599,VOGEL,No. We're not important enough. Everybody just hold hands until the bus driver gets back from his haircut.
13600,LEELA,"Aww, let's let those kids skate with us."
13601,CHAZ,What? Seriously? I'm trying to impress you with my cloud here.!
13602,LEELA,"I know, and it's working. But think how much skating would mean to those kids."
13603,ORPHAN,We came here instead of eating today.
13604,LEELA,This may be their only chance to skate in their whole lives. Who are we to say they can't?
13605,CHAZ,"The mayor's aide, and his badge! (shouting) Beat it kids! Come back when you got connections."
13606,VOGEL,Alright kids. Back to the Orphanarium. You can slide around the gym in your socks.
13607,SALLY,What socks?
13608,CHAZ,So am I gonna get lucky tonight or what?
13609,FRY,I hope your calculations are correct.
13610,GIANT BRAIN,Our calculations are always correct. For we are gigantic brains.
13611,BRAIN #2,Initiate space-time transfer.
13612,NIBBLER,I hereby place and order for one cheese pizza.
13613,PANUCCI [ON PHONE],"One pie, nothing good on it. Name?"
13614,NIBBLER,I-period C-period Wiener.
13615,PANUCCI [ON PHONE],"Uh, talk a little louder. It's sounds like you got some kind of tiny head on you or something."
13616,PAST FRY,"Hellooo? Pizza delivery for uh, Icy Wiener? Wiener? Aw crud."
13617,FUTURE FRY,Gotcha!
13618,NIBBLER,I don't understand.
13619,FUTURE FRY,Yes you do! You came back in time to knock me into that freezer. Now I came back in time to stop you.
13620,NIBBLER,I did not come back in time. My people lack that ability.
13621,FUTURE FRY,"But, I know you in the future. I cleaned your poop."
13622,NIBBLER,Quite possible. We live long and are celebrated poopers. You will meet me when I'm a thousand years older.
13623,FUTURE FRY,Not if you don't freeze me.
13624,NIBBLER,"Please. Our saviours foresee that in a thousand years, at one moment, the fate of the universe will depend on you. Since you will not live that long I must freeze you now."
13625,FUTURE FRY,"Well, why couldn't you just ask me?"
13626,NIBBLER,We were afraid you would refuse.
13627,FUTURE FRY,"Of course not, I love the future."
13628,NIBBLER (CHOKING),Then why are you choking me right now?
13629,FUTURE FRY,Because I don't like being used.
13630,NIBBLER,Well now it's your choice. Is there nothing in the future worth saving?
13631,FUTURE FRY,Leela. But she doesn't think much of me.
13632,NIBBLER,"Ah, she must be the other."
13633,FUTURE FRY,Wha?
13634,NIBBLER,You must not give up on her. I am stationed on a distant world known as Vergon 6. But if you return to the future I will transfer to Earth to give you what help I can.
13635,FUTURE FRY,You really think I would have had a chance with Leela?
13636,NIBBLER,You must choose. The present or the future? To save yourself? Or to save Leela?
13637,FUTURE FRY,Yes! Here I come future! Oh no! Wait! I'm gonna get trapped in the Infosphere again! Just remember that Scooty-Puff Jr sucks...
13638,NIBBLER,In a thousand years I'll get right on it.
13639,NARRATOR,"And so, a thousand years later Fry once again infiltrated the Infosphere and set off his amazing bomb. Only this time..."
13640,NIBBLER,Thank you for saving the universe Fry. Here.
13641,FRY,"Whoa, thanks! If you ever need a saviour again, just ask."
13642,NIBBLER,Oh we will. We will.
13643,FRY,"Man, I can't wait to tell everyone what happened."
13644,NIBBLER,Uh yes. Incidentally I need to remain undercover so I'm blanking your memory.
13645,FRY,Huh. Did everything just taste purple for a second? Oh well. Let's go home you dumb poop machine.
13646,LEELA,"Bender, would you do the honours?"
13647,BENDER,With gusto.
13648,FRY,Hey Leela. I guess I got this for you.
13649,LEELA,Oh. Thank you. You know what Fry. I don't care if you're not the most important person in the universe. It really makes me happy to see you right now.
13650,FRY,Then I am the most important person in the universe.
13651,THE END,
13652,FRY (OVER CREDITS),Yes!
13653,"""THE STING""",
13654,BENDER,"A hush comes over the crowd. The only sound is Bender calling everyone else a jerk and he swings!  And he slices it into the water, oh man!"
13655,FARNSWORTH,Bad news everyone. You're not good enough to go on your next mission.
13656,FRY,Hooray!
13657,BENDER,Not good enough!
13658,LEELA,Why? Says who?
13659,FARNSWORTH,Because. And says me. It's an extremely dangerous mission that killed my last crew. And you're not nearly as good as them.
13660,FRY,Woohoo!
13661,BENDER,We live to suck another day!
13662,LEELA,We're just as good as any of those crews you sent to their deaths. What's the mission?
13663,FARNSWORTH,Collecting honey. Ordinary honey.
13664,LEELA,That doesn't sound so dangerous.
13665,FARNSWORTH,This is no ordinary honey. It's produced by vicious space bees. A single sting of their hideous neuro-toxin can cause instant death!
13666,HERMES,"And that's if you're not allergic! You don't wanna know what happens then, oh no no, God no!"
13667,FARNSWORTH,Your insides will boil out of your eye sockets like a science fair volcano!
13668,HERMES,I didn't want to know1
13669,FARNSWORTH,These bees are larger than most Buicks and twice as ugly!
13670,FRY,Larger than an American sedan?  How big is the honey comb?
13671,HERMES,Honey comb's big. Yeah yeah yeah.
13672,BENDER,It's not small?
13673,HERMES,No no no.
13674,LEELA,It'll take more than deadly deadly bees to keep us from doing our job. Come on boys!
13675,FRY,But Leela we're no good!
13676,LEELA,"Listen, I'm scared too. But I'm more scared of disappointing myself."
13677,FRY,I'm not scared of that at all!
13678,LEELA,Now bees communicate by dancing.
13679,FRY,"Like my parents. Oh wait, that was hitting!"
13680,LEELA,So this language cartridge will let you distract them.
13681,BENDER,Ah good! I always have thoughts and feelings that can only be expressed through dance! (in bee) You stink! Bender's great! Deal with it!
13682,LEELA,Bender quick! Waggle something!
13683,BENDER (IN BEE),Hello fellow bees. How's the abdomen? Swollen with nectar I trust?
13684,BEE (IN BEE),Duh!
13685,FRY,Leela let's turn back. There's absolutely no shame in wussing out.
13686,LEELA,"Relax, everything'll be fine!"
13687,FRY,Oh my God! The old Planet Express ship!
13688,LEELA,There's the black box!
13689,MAN [ON TAPE],"Captain, the bees have us surrounded! Oh the Professor was right, we're not as good as his old crew!"
13690,CAPTAIN [ON TAPE],Well I aim to prove him wrong! It'll take more than a few deadly deadly bees to -  Oh Lord!
13691,LEELA,"Uh, couldn't make that out. Too much static!"
13692,BENDER,Ew!
13693,LEELA,We found it! The honey comb hideout!
13694,FRY,Hey what's this goop?
13695,LEELA,Royal jelly. They feed it to the queen.
13696,FRY,Bees make honey and jelly? Huh. How come nothing humans make taste good? Help! I can't swim in jelly as far as I know!
13697,LEELA,Look!  It's a baby queen! Aww she's so cute! You adorable wittle itty bitty fuzzy wuzzy -
13698,FRY,Leela! Stop bonding and lets go! I got jelly in my underpants!
13699,LEELA,I'm taking this bee with us. With queen we can build a hive and make more honey ourselves. Let me just pack her a lunch and we'll go.
13700,BENDER (IN BEE),Pick up the pace lady! I'm sick of shaking my booty for these fat jerks!  I didn't mean you're all fat. Just fatso there.
13701,BEES (IN BEE),He insulted our fat queen!
13702,QUEEN (IN BEE),"You try keeping your figure after 10,000 kids!"
13703,LEELA,This is where we distinguish ourselves from the last crew. Activate emergency high speed self contained escape pack crisis response unit! Quick!
13704,LEELA,Good luck Bender!
13705,BENDER,I'm back baby!
13706,FRY,We made it! We're alive!
13707,LEELA,Burn on that old crew! The only things they did better than us were suck and die!
13708,FRY,Leela we got lucky this time but you should be more careful. I don't want anything to happen to you.
13709,LEELA,"Thanks, but I can look out for myself. Frankly I can smell danger a mile away."
13710,FRY,Look out!  You want her you'll have to go through me.
13711,LEELA,You call that a wound? That's a boo boo top! But thanks for trying to save me Fry! Fry?  He's...he's dead.
13712,BENDER (CRYING),Who will make Bender waffles just the way he likes them now?
13713,LEELA (CRYING),It was all my fault! He died because of me!
13714,FARNSWORTH,No no no no no no no.  I'm lying to make her feel better.
13715,LABARBARA,"Husband, can't you go anywhere without lighting something up?"
13716,HERMES,It's an old Jamaican accounting tradition. We burn his timecard. That way his zombie doesn't come back looking for his final paycheque.
13717,AMY,He looks so natural. It's funny to think he's clammed full of sawdust and preservatives.
13718,ZOIDBERG,I only wish I could have removed the stinger.
13719,PRIEST,"I barely knew Philip, but as a clergyman I have no problem telling his most intimate friends all about him."
13720,HERMES,Soothe us with sweet lies.
13721,PRIEST,It may comfort you to know that Fry's death took only 15 seconds. Yet the pain was so intense that it felt to him like 15 years. And it goes without saying that it caused him to empty his bowels.  We now commend Fry's body to the ages.
13722,AMY,He's walking on sunshine now.
13723,FARNSWORTH,This makes me the oldest member of my family.
13724,AMAZONIAN,Him do good snu-snu.
13725,BENDER,"All those times I said ""Kill all humans"" I'd always whisper ""except one."" And Fry was that one. And I never told him so."
13726,TERRY (DRAMATICALLY),Farewell from the world of tomorrow!
13727,LEELA (CRYING),They say a spoonful of space honey helps ease the pain.  It's good.  I feel funny. Haha funny!
13728,FRY,Leela?
13729,LEELA,Fry? I thought you were dead.
13730,FRY,"Nope, I'm better than ever. Before the accident I couldn't do this!"
13731,LEELA,Impressive! But it does sorta support my You-Are-Dead theory.
13732,FRY,Then I'll prove I'm alive! By telling you something only I could know. There's a surprise for you in my locker. I got it at a Swedish novelty shop before we left.
13733,LEELA,It's too beautiful to open! Can I open it?
13734,FRY,Sure. There's just one thing I want you to.
13735,LEELA,What?
13736,FRY,I want you to wake up.
13737,LEELA,Wake up? But I'm not -
13738,LEELA,In my dream Fry said he hid a gift for me in my locker. If it's true then he must still exist in some form.
13739,FARNSWORTH,"Oh course he still exists. As a frozen corpse in outer space!  Oh, I made myself sad."
13740,LEELA,"Well, here goes."
13741,ZOIDBERG,Bupkiss!
13742,BENDER,"Well, I feel better now. Pawning all the stuff in Fry's locker helped give me closure."
13743,LEELA,Was there anything in there that might have been a gift for me?
13744,BENDER,No. Nothing. Not at all. No way José! Here it is.
13745,LEELA,You took this from Fry's locker?
13746,BENDER,Hey the guy's dead! There's no law against grave robbing!
13747,LEELA,That proves it. Fry is alive somewhere and he's reaching me in my dreams.
13748,FARNSWORTH,Bullpies!
13749,FARNSWORTH,Lay down here and we'll do some tests. If Fry is out there then Leela's brain could be acting as a five pound ouija board.
13750,LEELA,Is this some sort of brain scanner?
13751,FARNSWORTH,"Some sort yes. In France it's called a ""guillotine."""
13752,LEELA,Professor! Can't you examine my brain without removing it?
13753,FARNSWORTH,Yes. Easily.
13754,BENDER,"Hey, what if Fry wasn't actually dead when we buried him? Y'know like Julia Roberts?"
13755,FARNSWORTH,Well I suppose there's a slim -  I don't believe it!
13756,LEELA,What is it? Is Fry alive in some other dimension or something?
13757,FARNSWORTH,"No. According to this gizmometer, Fry is dead and nothing can bring him back! Remarkable."
13758,LEELA,"But, my dream. Your science can't unprove that! How could I have know the gift was in Fry's locker?"
13759,HERMES,Easy! He told you about it before he died! And your grief roasted mind blocked it out.
13760,LEELA,Are you saying I'm going crazy?
13761,FARNSWORTH,"No no, no one's saying that! But I'm certainly thinking it loudly."
13762,FRY,"Hi Leela! I'm just gonna keep talking, even if you can't hear me. Blah blah blah, blah blah blah blah blah."
13763,LEELA,"Shut up, I can hear you. The Professor says you're just a dream."
13764,FRY,Oh yeah?  Could a dream take you dancing in an illusion garden?
13765,LEELA,"Well yes, technically. It's still very sweet of you."
13766,FRY,Then what if we shared a sleigh ride across the ice fields of Hiperia?
13767,LEELA,Oh Fry you must be alive! I've never been treated so romantically by my own imagination before!
13768,FRY,"Here, take my jacket. You look a little cold."
13769,LEELA,Thank you. It's all so beautiful I forgot how many hundreds of degrees zero it must be. I just wish I could convince the others you're alive.
13770,FRY,You can. All you have to do is wake up.
13771,LEELA,No no! Don't say that! This is real!
13772,LEELA,Not another dream!  Fry's jacket! The one he was buried in! My dream was real! He's alive!
13773,BENDER,That's better!
13774,LEELA,Fry's alive! I have proof!
13775,BENDER,You do not!
13776,HERMES,"I'm from Jamaica, the show-me island. So show me you're blowing it out your fanny."
13777,LEELA,But he gave me his jacket. Look.
13778,FARNSWORTH,That's not Fry's jacket. Fry's jacket is red! That's your jacket. An off the rack lime green affair.
13779,LEELA,But Fry...his jacket...and when I woke up it was on me.
13780,HERMES,"You're under a lot of guilt stress Leela. Here, work it off."
13781,LEELA [SQUEEZING],I am not under stress dammit!
13782,LEELA,What?
13783,AMY,I said everything's going to be alright.
13784,LEELA,Oh. Maybe I am freaking out a little.
13785,BENDER,A little? You're screwier than my Aunt Rita! And she's a screw!
13786,LEELA,I need to calm down. I'd better take some more of that space honey.
13787,FARNSWORTH,You've been taking space honey? Be careful you purple haired imbecile!
13788,ZOIDBERG,"One spoonful calms you down, two spoonfuls help you sleep, but three spoonfuls, you'll go into a sleep and never wake up! Never!"
13789,BENDER (AMY'S VOICE),Never!
13790,LEELA,"One spoonful to calm me down.  OK, I've got a pretty good calm going! Two spoonfuls to help me sleep.  Uh oh, still awake. I guess one more spoonful couldn't hurt. Oh my gosh! I'd better get a sponge! Fry?  Is that you? I don't need a sponge!"
13791,FRY,Why and I sticky and naked? Did I miss something fun?
13792,FARNSWORTH,"Incredible! According to the gizmometer, Fry touched the royal jelly in the space hive, leaving an imprint of his DNA and brainwaves. Then, when it spilled on the couch, it recombined with trace amounts of Fry's hair and skin -"
13793,BENDER,And blood! Don't forget about Fry's blood!
13794,FARNSWORTH,"Yes Bender, thank you. In short, the various fluids Fry left in the couch caused the royal jelly to regenerate his entire being!"
13795,FRY,Neat!
13796,BENDER,This is great! My buddy's alive and his credit cards are valid again!  Lets go get hammered!
13797,ZOIDBERG,I should warn you: I'm a mean drunk.
13798,LEELA,"Fry, I'm so glad I didn't kill you."
13799,FRY,Me too.
13800,LEELA,Feeling responsible for your death was driving me mad. But now everything is alright.
13801,FRY,"Uh, not everything."
13802,LEELA,What? What do you mean?
13803,FRY,You have to wake up.
13804,LEELA,Wake up? Oh no! No! It can't be!
13805,LEELA,Poo.
13806,LEELA,"I'm cracking up. In my dreams I'm happy because Fry is alive, but when I'm awake my mind plays tricks on me."
13807,HERMES,Oh take it easy Leela.
13808,AMY,In every life we have some trouble.
13809,BENDER,But when you worry you make it double.
13810,FARNSWORTH (SINGING),The landlord says your rent is late...
13811,HERMES (SINGING),He might have to litigate.
13812,BENDER (SINGING),But don't worry!
13813,BEE (SINGING),Bee...
13814,FARNSWORTH (SINGING),...happy!
13815,ZOIDBERG (SINGING),"Ain't got no cash,"
13816,BEE (SINGING),Bee...
13817,ZOIDBERG (SINGING),...happy!
13818,HERMES (SINGING),Don't worry now Amy!
13819,AMY (SINGING),OK! I'm happy!
13820,BENDER (SINGING),Take us home Bender! Don't worry!
13821,BEE (SINGING),Bee...
13822,BENDER (SINGING),...happy!
13823,LEELA,"Uh, were you just singing?"
13824,BENDER,No I was telling you not to worry. I'm not allowed to sing - court order.
13825,LEELA,"I'll find Fry's coffin, take his corpse and keep it under my mattress to remind me he's really dead. That'll prove I'm not insane."
13826,LEELA,"OK, it's just an ordinary coffin. Containing my ordinary dead friend, who I killed."
13827,LEELA,What happened? Why am I in my apartment?
13828,LEELA,Stop it! Stop it!
13829,BENDER,You killed Fry!
13830,LEELA,"OK, I'm insane! But I'm still sane enough to know it.  The only time I feel alright is in my dreams. With you.  Three spoonfuls. Then I can dream forever.  One.  Two Here goes. Goodbye waking world."
13831,FRY'S PHOTO,"Leela! No!  Listen to me, you don't want to lie in bed like a vegetable and do nothing the rest of your life. I've tried it. Bedsores hurt!"
13832,LEELA (CRYING),Then what am I s'posed to do?
13833,FRY'S PHOTO,Fight it!
13834,LEELA (CRYING),I can't!
13835,FRY'S PHOTO,You can! The Leela I know doesn't give up this easily.
13836,LEELA,OK. I'll try.  Go away!
13837,FRY'S PHOTO,I don't know if you can hear me Leela but there's something I wanna tell you. I love you.
13838,LEELA (CRYING),I'm so scared Fry I don't know what to do.
13839,FRY'S PHOTO,Just wake up Leela. Please. Just wake up.
13840,LEELA (CRYING),I don't understand what you mean!
13841,FRY (CRYING),Just wake up. Please. Just wake up Leela.
13842,LEELA,Fry. You're alive!
13843,FRY,Leela! You're awake!
13844,LEELA,Of course I'm awake. You wouldn't stop waking me.  Where am I?
13845,FRY,In the hospital. The ambulance brought you here right after the bee stung you.
13846,LEELA,But the bee stung you. It barely touched me.
13847,FRY,Stinger went right through me and you got all the poison. My new spleen came from a guy who liked to motorcycle.
13848,HERMES,Sweet three toed sloth of ice planet Hoth! She's awake!
13849,BENDER,You were in the best coma I've ever seen!
13850,AMY,The doctor said you'd never wake up.
13851,LEELA,Really? How long was I out?
13852,AMY,Two weeks. Fry never left your side for a minute.
13853,ZOIDBERG,"And he talked non-stop, like a parrot of the sea he was."
13854,FRY,"I though that if you heard a familiar voice, it might help keep your mind together. But, who knows if it really got through."
13855,LEELA,It got through Fry.  It got through.
13856,THE END,
13857,"""THE FARNSWORTH PARABOX""",
13858,FRY (SHOUTING),"I know you've rejected me a lot before but frankly I wasn't sure we were right for each other either, but now I am! So how 'bout a date tonight?"
13859,LEELA,"(shouting): Sorry I think I, um, I think I left my toaster on."
13860,FRY (SHOUTING),"C'mon Leela, what's the real reason you won't go out with me?"
13861,LEELA (SHOUTING),"Look, I'm embarrassed to admit this but you forced me to. I can't go out tonight because ......I have sweaty boot rash!"
13862,AMY,No spluh! Why do you think I'm sitting over here in the stink-free zone?
13863,FRY,"So, will you go out with me?"
13864,FARNSWORTH,"Good news everyone, I'm still technically alive! Yes!  But I need to you to dispose of this crazy ass experiment that almost killed me.  You'll have to throw it into the sun itself, for only the thermonuclear inferno of the sun has enough energy to ensure its total destruction!"
13865,BENDER,I can hit it with a shovel!
13866,FARNSWORTH,That's not good enough.
13867,BENDER,This one time I pounded a guy into the ground like a stake with a shovel!
13868,FARNSWORTH,Yes yes!
13869,ZOIDBERG,So what's in the box already?
13870,FARNSWORTH,No peeking!  I don't know what's in there but I'm sure our minds would be unable to comprehend -
13871,HERMES,Ow! You hurt my collater!
13872,FARNSWORTH,"I don't care.  Listen well: No matter what happens, no matter how great your curiosity, you are forbidden to look in this box. Forbidden!  Pretty tantilising though!"
13873,FRY,Whatever's in there it's the only thing I've ever wanted.
13874,ZOIDBERG,In my experience boxes are usually empty. Or maybe with a little cheese stuck to the top. And one time pepperoni! What a day that was!  (shouting) Give me the box!
13875,HERMES,"Scram you lousy green snakes!  Here Leela, take this and use it to shoot those guys."
13876,LEELA,Right! If they try to look in the box.
13877,HERMES,Whatever.
13878,FRY,Let's just forget about the box. The Professor said to stay away.
13879,BENDER,"Fry, how can you be so naive? He was joking. Get it?"
13880,FRY,No.
13881,BENDER,That's what makes it so funny!  OK he wasn't joking now shut up and follow me.
13882,FRY [FROM VENT],Ow it's hot! The butter in my pocket is melting!
13883,BENDER,We thank you Bender for the gift we are about to receive!
13884,FRY,Tangled up Christmas lights! We can take shifts untangling them!
13885,BENDER,Unlabled booze! Widemouth too!
13886,LEELA,That oughta keep those dopes occupied. I can guard the real box in peace now that no one's curious about it.
13887,LEELA,"Well, I got through the night and no one looked in the box. Not even me. The person who gave up her whole evening to watch it. A whole evening of TV gone. What a mockery of justice it is that I can't take even a little tiny peek! I need coffee.  OK. Heads I look, tails I don't.  Oh yeah! Heads! I mean - alright then!  No. I have a duty not to look. But then again, I promised the coin I would.  Oh it's deep. Deeper than a small box should be."
13888,LEELA,Ouch! My lawyer will hear about this!
13889,FRY 1,"Leela, what have you done?"
13890,LEELA,"Nothing. What do you mean ""why was I looking in the box?"""
13891,FRY 1,I mean your hair. It's all different-y.
13892,LEELA,Bender? Is that you?
13893,BENDER 1,You know it! Large and in charge!
13894,FARNSWORTH 1,"Leela? Oh, there's a woman for you! Always dying her hair instead of not looking in a box."
13895,LEELA,I didn't dye my hair. This is how I always look.
13896,BENDER 1,"No, that's how you always look.  This throws my entire perception of reality into question. Clone? Robot? Or long lost twin? Taking all bets! I also offer video poker!"
13897,FRY 1,It's some guy wearing a Leela costume! Get him!
13898,LEELA,Hold it! You have this all wrong. I just fell into the box and then I fell out somehow.
13899,FRY 1,You shut up sir.
13900,FARNSWORTH 1,"No wait, I've got it! I know what's in the box. Oh I've been as dumb as Fry!"
13901,FRY 1,Am not!
13902,FARNSWORTH 1,It contains a parallel universe! And when you create a parallel universe it's almost always populated by evil twins!
13903,LEELA,"No look, I am not evil. My loan officer said so."
13904,FARNSWORTH 1,Oh you'd like us to believe that wouldn't you Leela? Or should I say Eveela?
13905,BENDER 1,Oh this is awful. Somewhere there's a Bender more evil than me. I do my best dammit!
13906,FARNSWORTH 1,Leela?  The good Leela.  I want you to snoop around the other universe and find out how evil they are.  Here.
13907,LEELA,I tell you they're not evil. But don't be confused. They are jerks.
13908,LEELA 1,Come out of your universe with your hands up!
13909,FRY,Oh wow. It's like that drug trip I saw in that movie when I was on that drug trip.
13910,FARNSWORTH,Astonishing. I must have created a parallel universe!
13911,FARNSWORTH 1,Baldercrap! I created your universe! All you created was my fist parallel to your face!
13912,FARNSWORTH,Ow.
13913,LEELA,Look. It doesn't matter who created what. The important thing is - yah!
13914,LEELA 1 (WHISPERING),"We're exactly the same. I know all her moves. Therefore, I've got the upper hand."
13915,FARNSWORTH 1,"Now now, perfectly symmetrical violence never solved anything."
13916,FARNSWORTH,Let's recap what's happened so far. As you can see I accidentally created a box containing your universe.
13917,FARNSWORTH 1,"While I, in a simultaineous blunder created a box containing your universe."
13918,LEELA,"This is getting confusing. Why don't we call our universe ""Universe A"" and this universe ""Universe B""?"
13919,BENDER 1,"Hey, why can't we be universe A?"
13920,FRY 1,Yeah!
13921,AMY 1,Yeah!
13922,ZOIDBERG 1,We want the best letter!
13923,FRY,"We called it first. Besides, this place kinda feels like a ""B"" y'know?"
13924,LEELA 1,"Alright, you can be crummy universe A. And we'll be universe 1!"
13925,FRY 1,"Or ""The Mongooses,"" that's a cool team name. The Fighting Mongooses!"
13926,FARNSWORTH,Wait a minute. If our universes are identical then why did our Leela look into the box and your Leela didn't?
13927,LEELA 1,Well to be honest I tossed a coin. It came up tails so I didn't look.
13928,LEELA,That's weird. Mine came up heads so I did.
13929,FARNSWORTH,Interesting. Apparently the key difference between our universes is that coin flips have opposite outcomes.
13930,BENDER,That explains fruity here!  I tossed a coin to pick my finish. Foghat grey!
13931,BENDER 1,Hey! Bite my glorious golden ass!
13932,FARNSWORTH,Your people and your slight differences disgust me. I'm going home. Where's that blue box with our universe in it?
13933,FARNSWORTH 1,Oh you'd like to get back to your evil universe wouldn't you? And destroy your box with our universe inside it.
13934,FARNSWORTH,Nonsense! I would never do such a thing unless you would already have been going to do that!
13935,FARNSWORTH 1,Wha?
13936,FARNSWORTH,You heard me!
13937,FARNSWORTH 1,"In any case, I've hidden the box and it will remain hidden unitil I'm convinced you're not evil!  Everyone, keep an eye on your evil counterpart."
13938,FARNSWORTH,And you all do the same!
13939,LEELA 1,"Um, can Fry and I watch our parallel selves together? We have plans tonight."
13940,LEELA,You guys are dating?
13941,FRY 1,Oh no no no. We're married.
13942,BENDER,I've got my eye on you boy!
13943,BENDER 1,Don't even think about it lunch-pail! You'd be dead before you hit the ground!
13944,BENDER,Good point. Whatyya say we just hit a strip joint?
13945,BENDER 1,"I was waitin' for one of us to say that! Bender A, you're a prince among robots! Can you forgive me for distrusting you?"
13946,BENDER,"Aw, I can't stay mad at what is essentially me. I love me!"
13947,AMY 1,This is so great! I always wanted an imaginary friend!
13948,AMY,"I'm not imaginary, I'm parallel! We're exactly the same, right down to the -  Splech! Is that pink nail polish?"
13949,AMY 1,"Is that not pink nail polish? The Professor's right, you are evil! And shallow!"
13950,AMY,I am not evil!
13951,LEELA,"So Fry, Leela, how'd you two get together?"
13952,FRY 1,Funny story. I asked Leela out a million times and she just kept rejecting me.
13953,LEELA 1,"I'd make up things like ""I have sweaty boot-rash"" or ""I have to meet the President""!"
13954,FRY 1,"Oh man, you never heard such excuses! But, like a dope, I believed her. Looking back on it now it's kinda funny!"
13955,FRY (SARCASTIC),"It sure is, right Leela? Funny. Ha ha ha ha!"
13956,LEELA 1,Then one night when Fry asked me out the only excuse I could think of involved ghosts. I knew he wouldn't buy it so I did what I always do in those situations.
13957,LEELA,Oh Lord!
13958,LEELA 1,I flipped a coin. It came up heads and we went out.
13959,FRY,You mean you flipped the coin too? And it was tails? So that's why you said you had to meet that ghost.
13960,LEELA 1,You really missed out on something Leela. That date was magical.
13961,FRY 1,"One year later I gave Leela a diamond scrunchy, and we were married."
13962,LEELA,Woo!
13963,FRY,One year later I got beat up at a Neil Diamond concert by a guy named Scrunchy!
13964,FARNSWORTH 1,Well that was pointless.
13965,FARNSWORTH,"Say, I hope you won't think it ""evil"" of me to ask how you got that stylish head wound!"
13966,FARNSWORTH 1,Oh this old thing? I was experimenting to see if I could remove my own brain!
13967,FARNSWORTH,Of course! I had the same idea! I flipped a coin to decide if I should proceed but it came up tails - so I didn't. How'd it go?
13968,FARNSWORTH 1,Well getting the brain out was the easy part. The hard part was getting the brain out!
13969,FARNSWORTH,Oh you!
13970,ZOIDBERG 1,"So, tell me about yourself!"
13971,ZOIDBERG,Well don't look into it but I'm a respected internal medicine doctor! Ooo a can!
13972,ZOIDBERG 1,"As for me I design mansions, then live in them.  (crying) I'm lying! I'm an appalling failure!"
13973,ZOIDBERG (CRYING),Me too! A big fat one.
13974,ZOIDBERG 1,And those co-workers. Always looking down on us Zoidbergs. What are they? From Nob Hill?
13975,ZOIDBERG,"They're all like ""Stop spraying me with ink Zoidberg!"" ""Put on pants Zoidberg!"" ""Don't touch our fancy box Zoidberg!"""
13976,ZOIDBERG 1,Oh that box! Too good for us is it?
13977,ZOIDBERG,"Bah! Someday they'll watch! From down in the gutter they will, as King Zoidberg caresses their fancy box."
13978,ZOIDBERG 1,"You know, maybe a certain blue lobster saw where Professor hid the box!"
13979,FARNSWORTH 1,Good news everyones!
13980,FARNSWORTH,"After carefully reading the scriptures, we've concluded that none of us are evil!"
13981,FARNSWORTH 1,"Yes, the Bible is the real good news! Anyhow, you're all free to go back to your own universe."
13982,HERMES 1,What's goin' on here? Why aren't you all out destroying the Professor's box?
13983,LEELA 1,"Hermes, aren't you confused about the fact thats there's two of everybody?"
13984,HERMES 1,"No. Now like my granny used to say back in her tall paper shack on Montego Bay ""If you want a box hurled into the sun, you got to do it yourself!"""
13985,FARNSWORTH 1,Your granny can go to hell! I've hidden the box so that no one can destroy the home universe of my handsome friend here!
13986,FARNSWORTH,Oh go on! Wait a second. If your Hermes was about to destroy the box containing our universe...
13987,FARNSWORTH 1,Then your Hermes...
13988,FARNSWORTH,Oh my!
13989,HERMES,"Like granny said ""If you want a box hurled into the sun, you got to do it yourself!"" God rest her zombie bones."
13990,LEELA,So we go through the box and stop Hermes?
13991,FARNSWORTH,Right. Good thing Professor B there hid it in the sealed clam tank. No one but a crazy lobster would look there!
13992,FARNSWORTH 1,It's gone!
13993,ZOIDBERG,All hail Zoidberg! The king with the box!  Now it's my turn maybe?
13994,ZOIDBERG 1,The box says no.
13995,HERMES 1 (CRYING),"If I know parallel Hermes, he's at the sun by now."
13996,BENDER 1,Our universe is doomed!
13997,BENDER AND BENDER 1,Dooooomed!
13998,FARNSWORTH 1,Now don't give up yet you cry babies. The box is gone but we still have one preposterously slim hope.
13999,AMY,Is it a kind of hairspray?
14000,FARNSWORTH,No. We must attempt to create another box containing our universe! Doy!
14001,FRY 1,Well? Is that your universe in there?
14002,FRY [FROM BOX],Nope. Too cold.
14003,HERMES 1,"Oh man it's hopeless! We'll never find your universe in time! Plus, this box is stuck on my fat head."
14004,FARNSWORTH 1,Yes it's the apocalypse alright. I always thought I'd have a hand in it!
14005,BENDER 1,"I'm not sad. Because I finally found someone as great as me! It's like I always say: ""Make new friends and keep the old. One is silver..."""
14006,BENDER,"""...and the other's gold!"""
14007,ZOIDBERG 1,Why with the long faces?
14008,LEELA 1,The idiots have the box!
14009,ZOIDBERG,I think she means you.
14010,FARNSWORTH 1,Grab them!
14011,AMY,Splug! Which one did they go into?
14012,FARNSWORTH 1,"We'll have to search a universe. Everyone, grab a length of wire first so you can find your way back."
14013,AMY 1,Hello? Did you see two smelly lobsters?
14014,HERMES 25,We didn't see anything.......ever!
14015,FRY,"Yo, did two shellfish in scrubs go by?"
14016,FRY 1729,Hell no.
14017,LEELA 1729,Shut up!
14018,BENDER 1729,Beat it jerk!
14019,LEELA,"Uh, have you robot versions of yourselves seen any extra Zoidbergs around here?"
14020,LEELA,"Uh, access denied."
14021,BENDER 1,Hey man look what I snagged from the leprachaun universe!
14022,BENDER,Yeah leprachaun universe is fine...if you haven't seen pirate universe!
14023,BENDER 1,Faith and begota!
14024,FARNSWORTH XVII,Quae?
14025,ZOIDBERG,"Quick, into another box!"
14026,ZOIDBERG 1,"There aren't any in this universe there aren't. Hey you, what with the no boxes?"
14027,FARNSWORTH 420,"Baby they're somewhere, everything's like somewhere! Place is kinda au natural right now."
14028,FARNSWORTH 1,There they are!
14029,FARNSWORTH,Gotcha!
14030,FARNSWORTH 420,Dig it! All of you living in this boxed is like seriously freaked up!
14031,FARNSWORTH,"Nonsense, why there's a whole universe in there."
14032,FARNSWORTH 420,"Dude, there's a universe in all of us."
14033,AMY 420,Right on Professor Freaksworth!
14034,FARNSWORTH,Get a job! (shouting into the parabox) We've got the box. Everyone pull your wires.
14035,FARNSWORTH,Hurry! Back to Universe A!
14036,FARNSWORTH,Hermes don't press that button!
14037,HERMES,
14038,ZOIDBERG,So long your majesty!
14039,FRY,"There but for the flip of a coin go we. So uh Leela, seeing how the universe wasn't destroyed, you wanna catch an ape fight? Y'know? Together?"
14040,LEELA,"Well, I guess you deserve one more flip."
14041,FRY,So? Heads or tails?
14042,LEELA,"Y'know, lets just say it's heads."
14043,FARNSWORTH,Ready?
14044,FARNSWORTH,There. That space-time inversion has given us their box and vice-versa!
14045,LEELA,So what you think you just explain to us is that -
14046,FARNSWORTH,Correct! This box contains our own universe!
14047,HERMES,Sweet honey bee of infinity!
14048,LEELA,"Bender, quit destroying the universe!"
14049,BENDER,But...aw!
14050,FARNSWORTH,"Yes, all that is and ever shall be is in that box! And the box itself is probably worth something too. We must cherish it, as we cherish every moment of our lives."
14051,THE END,
14052,"""THREE HUNDRED BIG BOYS""",
14053,ANNOUNCER [ON TV],This week in the universe... Dateline Turantulon 6: The brave warriors of Earth under the command of General Major Weeblo Zapp Brannigan have achieved victory over the spider homeworld. And to the victor belong the spoils - one trillion dollars in silken treasure.
14054,ZAPP [ON TV],Mmm!
14055,NIXON [ON TV],"My fellow Earthicans. After meeting with top voodoo economists, I have decided to refund our silk surplus to you, the taxpayers. That's right! I've sent you each 300 buckeroos in the form of a tricky dick fun bill. Knock yourselves out!"
14056,AMY,I'm slightly richer!
14057,BENDER,What to do what to do? One $300 hookerbot or 300 $1 hookerbots?
14058,LEELA,I'm going to swim with the whale! They're the gentle giants of the deep.
14059,FARNSWORTH,I'm well aware of that.
14060,SCRUFFY,Scruffy's gonna get himself one of them $300 haircuts. This ones lost it's pizazz!
14061,ZOIDBERG,"A fortune it is! At last, Zoidberg will live like a rich man!"
14062,NIXON [ON BILL],"Hey, cut it out! Go away! Get away from me!"
14063,AMY,"Shmeesh! It's just 300 bucks, what is that, like a hundred cups of coffee?"
14064,FRY,"That's it! I'm getting a hundred cups of coffee! Starting now.  Coffee machine, one cup of coffee please."
14065,NIXON [ON BILL],Smells good!
14066,ZAPP [ON SCREEN],Leela? Are you there?
14067,LEELA,No.
14068,ZAPP [ON SCREEN],Oh yes you are! I'm hereby inviting you and your oddball co-workers to a special reception to display the national silk surplus. I believe you know the heroic space stallion who captured it. Show them my medal Kif.
14069,KIF [ON SCREEN],He rented it with his tax refund.
14070,ZAPP [ON SCREEN],"So Leela, will you have the pleasure."
14071,LEELA,What little there is to be had.
14072,ZAPP [ON SCREEN],Tomorrow night at eight them. Smoochies!
14073,CRACK ADDICT,No cheap crack houses for me no more!
14074,MAN,Very good sir. Shall I pre-warm sir's crack pipe?
14075,AMY,"Oh Kif, it was so romantic of you to rent this peddle plane with your tax rebate. We're like two dandelion seeds wafting on the breeze."
14076,KIF (GASPING),Yes...seeds...wafting.
14077,AMY,I almost feel kinda shallow for blowing my rebate on this cool talking tattoo!
14078,TATTOO,Hey Gordon Gecko! I cost as much as this whole crummy date!
14079,AMY,Shut up!  Ow!
14080,FARNSWORTH,As a man it has become too much of a chore for me to clean out my wrinkles each day. Is it true that stem cells may fight the aging process?
14081,GENEWORKS WOMAN,"Well yes, in the same way an infant may fight Muhammed Ali! But -"
14082,FARNSWORTH,One pound of stem cells please.
14083,GENEWORKS WOMAN,Of course any age reversing effects will be purely temporary.
14084,BENDER,"Say buddy, why's this grand cigar so pricy?"
14085,CLERK,"Well, as you can see, it's wrapper is a piece of the original US constitution. It was hand rolled by Queen Elizabeth during her wild years and was buried with George Burns until graverobbing space mushrooms - uh, well you know the rest."
14086,BENDER,Give me 300 bucks worth!
14087,CLERK,No can do.
14088,BENDER,"Oh alright, I'll just take these $300 burglars tools then."
14089,CLERK,Very good sir.
14090,BENDER,"So uh, what time d'you close tonight?"
14091,DWIGHT,Hey pops! Did that tax rebate come?
14092,HERMES,Came and went! You're now the proud owner of Bamboo Boogie Boots!  With a warning label this big you know they gotta be fun!
14093,DWIGHT,"But pops, I don't wanna have fun, I wanna be like you. Boring but prudently invested."
14094,HERMES,Babylon's bells! I tallyed almost 300 bananas on this entertainment product. Now you put 'em on and have fun!
14095,DWIGHT (SHOUTING),I don't wanna.
14096,HERMES,Well then I'm gonna put 'em on and make you watch me have fun!  See? Fun! Fun! Dwight! Help me!
14097,DWIGHT,I'll save you pops!
14098,FARNSWORTH,Hey! Turn that damn music......up!
14099,HERMES,Isn't this fun?
14100,DWIGHT,No! I wish I had two mommies!
14101,RANDY,"Try these, um, sir."
14102,ZOIDBERG,I ask for rich guy stuff and you give me shiny pebbles? Bah! I bid you adieu!
14103,RANDY,Ow!
14104,LEELA,I'd like a pass to swim with Mushu please.
14105,WHALE BIOLOGIST,Well you asked the right guy! I'm the whale biologist! Though personally I hate whales. (whispering) Espeically Mushu.
14106,LEELA,Then why'd you become a whale biologist?
14107,WHALE BIOLOGIST,I don't know you well enough to get into that. $300 please.  Noon tomorrow. If you're late you only get to tread water in the scallop tank.
14108,FRY,"Uh, I'll have a coffee."
14109,MAN,"Guppy, trout, mermaid or -"
14110,FRY,Whale please.
14111,KIF (GASPING),"Amy, I-I also spent some of my tax rebate on a gift for you."
14112,AMY,Oh Kiffie!
14113,KIF,It shows the time wherever we both are. And it's powered by love! Also you have to wind it.
14114,TATTOO,Ohh! Somebody won big at Skeeball!
14115,AMY,You shut up! I love it Kif. I'll use it whenever I wanna know what time it is.  Ooo! It's Fry and Leela! (shouting) Hi Fry and Leela!
14116,KIF,Oh! Keep peddling! Oh for the love of God keep peddling!
14117,AMY (SHOUTING),Bye Fry and Leela!
14118,TATTOO,Oh I can't wait until the tattoos on Amy's butt hear about this!
14119,BUTT TATTOOS,Hear about what? Tell us!
14120,AMY,Don't feel sad my little tadpole.
14121,KIF (CRYING),I'm trying not to. But my gift to you is in the belly of a whale.
14122,ZOIDBERG,"Say, this reminds me of that time I ate that other watch Kif gave you!"
14123,AMY,"Hey, it is kinda like that!"
14124,ZOIDBERG,"To induce vomitting, that was the solution! Everywhere it went!  What a Valentine's Day that was!"
14125,LEELA,"Hmm, this may seem like a huge coincidence but I happen to have it in with that whale!"
14126,SCRUFFY,Scruffy's formulated a plan. But you'll need a ready source of nausiatin' rotten fish.
14127,ELZAR,Freshen your coffee sir?
14128,FRY,Yeah yeah yeah keep it comin' put the pot down get away!
14129,WOMAN,You're so young in spirit! Its hard to believe you're as old as 25.
14130,FARNSWORTH,The key is to grab life by the hojos! Live every day like it might be your last!
14131,ELZAR,What'll it be kids?
14132,FARNSWORTH,One bowl of mild verena.
14133,LEELA,Pay dirt!  Heyya!
14134,ELZAR,Here you go big spender: Foie gras and caviar!
14135,ZOIDBERG,Goose liver? Fish eggs?  Pah! Where's the goose? Where's the fish?
14136,ELZAR,"Hey, that's what rich people eat. The garbage parts of the food."
14137,ZOIDBERG,I ate garbage yesterday and it didn't cost me $300! I'm not paying.  Farewell good sir!
14138,BENDER,Le Grand Cigar! She's mine! And with absolutely no consequences!
14139,SMITTY,You see that?
14140,URL,Grand theft tobacco. Sounds like we should get off our fat cop asses and ride!
14141,ELZAR,Pee-yew! This fish is slightly too rotten to even make jambolaya!
14142,AMY (WHISPERING),So far so good. Where's Kif?
14143,FRY (SHOUTING),This isn't Yemeni! It's Sulowesi!  And the cup's shaking I don't want my coffee shaking!
14144,BENDER,You seem a tad wound up buddy. And your face is greasy! Real greasy. You been up all night?
14145,FRY,Of course I've been up all night! Not because of caffine it was insomnia I couldn't stop thinking about coffee I need a nap.  Coffee time!
14146,BENDER,Ah! Mighty fine smokable!
14147,FRY,Fancy cigar why don't you smoke it already? Puff puff go go go go go!
14148,BENDER,"Nah, you can't blow smoke from such a majestic stogy in just anyone's face. I'm saving it for the fancy pants at Zapp Brannigan's black tie reception. You comin'?"
14149,WHALE BIOLOGIST,And the fifth reason whales kill is for the sheer fun of it.
14150,LEELA,Anything else?
14151,WHALE BIOLOGIST,"Yeah. You're lumpy and you smell awful. Hey, I calls 'em like I sees 'em! I'm a whale biologist."
14152,LEELA,"OK Mushu, its feeding time!  Oh crud, he ate my suit!"
14153,WHALE BIOLOGIST,The suit was ugly - whale biologist!
14154,CADDY,Perhaps if you tightened your grip sir?
14155,ZOIDBERG,"Ah. Thank you golf slave!  Bah! Rich pople wouldn't waste their time on this nonsense! Plus, these eggs are gritty and tasteless!"
14156,FARNSWORTH,Ow! Not so rough!
14157,WHALE BIOLOGIST,"Ladies and gentlemen, presenting Mushu! The educated whale who thinks he's better than you!"
14158,AMY,C'mon Mushu! Barf! Barf like a freshman!
14159,WHALE BIOLOGIST,"And now ignorant whale lovers, we'll see who's boss as I make Mushu jump through this hoop. Jump Mushu!  Who wants a fish?"
14160,LITTLE ORPHAN,Mushu is sick!
14161,URL,It just keep comin' and comin'!
14162,KIF,"Wait, that chunk, its the watch!  I got it Amy! I got it! The plan went off without a -"
14163,WHALE BIOLOGIST,He's got Aquarium property! Stop him!
14164,URL,Better do what he says. He's a whale biologist!
14165,SMITTY,You're under arrest you squishy punk!
14166,ZAPP,"The Spiderians, though weak and woman-like on the battlefield, are masters of the textile arts. Taste like king crab by the way. Crazy bugs actually wove this tapestry of my heroic conquest while I was still killing them!"
14167,ZOIDBERG,"What? It's not even scratch and sniff? But if rich people think it's good, I'll buy it!  One art please!"
14168,MOM,What a clever impersonation of a stupid poor person! How much is that placemat actually worth Brannigan?
14169,ZAPP,Exactly $1 billion!
14170,MOM,Now that's walkin' around money!
14171,NIXON [ON BILL],What? Hey! Wait! Arooo!
14172,WHITEY,"So I said to Kitty ""The only way to keep the butler from running away is to cut off his foot!""  Yes, it reminds me of a joke I heard about upper-middle class people."
14173,AMY (CRYING),I've never been sad at a party before. I wonder if my mind is thinking about Kif being in jail.
14174,SCRUFFY,Jail's not so bad. You can make sangria in the terlet! Course its shank or beshanked.
14175,AMY (CRYING),Of course.
14176,WHALE BIOLOGIST,"Look, just give back the property and we'll drop the charges."
14177,KIF,"Fine, have the watch. It's broken anyway."
14178,WHALE BIOLOGIST,I don't want your watch. You're covered in precious ambergris.
14179,KIF,Precious ambergris?
14180,HOLO-ROSEANNE,"Ambergris. Noun. A grease-like product of the sperm whale's digestive tract that is used as a base in the finest perfumes. This has been Roseanne, your guide to the world of facts."
14181,WHALE BIOLOGIST,You heard Roseanne. Scrape off the priceless ambergris and I'll let you go!
14182,KIF,Or better yet I'll simply shed my skin!
14183,MORBO,Stop it! Stop it! It's fine! I will destroy you!
14184,FARNSWORTH,"Wha?  Uh, gotta go, uh fight club!"
14185,WOMAN,What's happening Hubie?
14186,FARNSWORTH,I'm afraid the face you fell in love with was actually just a blob of living gunk I bought with my tax refund.
14187,WOMAN,"Well as long as we're being honest, I also spent my tax refund on a crazy treatment."
14188,FARNSWORTH,That certainly is honest.
14189,WOMAN,"It better for us both to just be ourselves. You, wrinkled as a prune."
14190,FARNSWORTH,"You, fat as the Queen of Seacows."
14191,WOMAN,I love you!
14192,FARNSWORTH,Oh my!
14193,KIF,So you see the putrid waxy substance I was coated with was -
14194,AMY,Not precious ambergris?
14195,KIF,"Yes! And I managed to sneak some out in a usual place! Ta-da!  Using that, I'll make you a perfume of lilac and jasmine and frankenberry!"
14196,AMY,"Oh Kif, it's so romantic I can't even wait! I'm gonna wear it right now!"
14197,MOM,Who smells like freaking porpus hork?
14198,AMY,I do! Kiss me Kif!
14199,ZOIDBERG (CRYING),Oh what a foolish squid I've been. I'm not rich! I can't even buy one measley masterpiece!
14200,HOBO #1,Pardon us gent. Might a couple of hungry hungry hobos take a feed from that aluminium snack box?
14201,ZOIDBERG,So now I'm in the gutter? Surrounded by bums who eat garbage. Money brought me no happiness. Bupkiss!
14202,HOBO #2,Ooo this boot's got a little pudding at the bottom!
14203,BEELER,"Interestingly, the Spiderians are more closely related to our elephants than our spiders."
14204,HERMES (SHOUTING),Don't mind us!
14205,NIXON,The loot! The loot! The loot is on fire!
14206,ZAPP,Leela! My precious rock tub! I'll save you!
14207,KIF,Everyone! To the fire door!
14208,LEELA,It's on fire!
14209,FARNSWORTH,We're trapped my sweet hippopotamus!
14210,FRY,Coffee coffee coffee coffee coffee coffee coffee coffee coffee coffee!
14211,DWIGHT,Where are we pops?
14212,WOMAN,What happened to the food?
14213,LEELA,I think we were saved by a mysterious orange blur.
14214,ZOIDBERG,Welcome one and all. I finally figured out how money could make me happy! By using it to buy my hungry friends a feast!
14215,HOBO #2,Everyone join us. Oysters rockafeller here has provided genuine turkey dogs!
14216,WHITEY,"Heck, you're never too rich to enjoy a free turkey dog!"
14217,WOMAN,I'll take four!
14218,LEELA,Me too!
14219,MOM,Oh what the hell!
14220,HERMES,"Here Dwight, $299 and 99 cents. You invest this penny like you want it."
14221,DWIGHT,Thanks Dad. I'm gonna take this and buy five shares of amazon.com!
14222,HERMES,A risk taker? That's my boy!
14223,NIXON,The entire surplus has gone! What a muguvern I've been! Why did I have to issue that crooked tax rebate?
14224,LEELA,At least we got a few mildly interesting stories out of it.
14225,FARNSWORTH,Oh my yes!
14226,BENDER,"Speaking of which, my story kinda peetered out without me learning a lesson!"
14227,SMITTY,There he is!
14228,BENDER,All right! Closure!
14229,THE END,
14230,"""SPANISH FRY""",
14231,FARNSWORTH,Oh Lord. Hiking is always such a strain on the buttocks.
14232,FRY,Shh! What was that sound?
14233,BENDER,"It wasn't a bird's nest falling. That sounds like this.  Aww, they're so cute when they're scared!"
14234,FRY,I meant the sound Bigfoot just made. He's been sighted a lot in this area recently. Just last week a blind hiker felt him!
14235,FARNSWORTH,Don't tell me you actually believe in Bigfoot you blathering ninny-hammer!
14236,FRY,"Of course I do! Bigfoot's my hero. Growing up, he was the celebrity I most identified with."
14237,ZOIDBERG,Why?
14238,FRY,'Cause he was a loner who hated the popular monsters yet longed to be one.
14239,ZOIDBERG,(sadly) I can so relate to that.
14240,LEELA,"Ugh, enough emotions! This isn't a fat camp for God sake. (quietly) Though you wouldn't know it from looking."
14241,BENDER,Ahh!
14242,ZOIDBERG,"Bender, if you want to sleep in the tent tonight, you're welcome to join me and Hermes for a little ""just friends"" spooning."
14243,BENDER,"Nah, I'm comfy out here under the stars. Real comfy!"
14244,RANGER PARK,Hey I'm Ranger Park the park ranger.
14245,FRY,I get it!
14246,RANGER PARK,Now since this area's a National Bigfoot Reserve we'll start with a short film about Bigfoot while I make a few phonecalls.
14247,FRY,That proves it!
14248,RANGER PARK,"It should say ""Top Quality Exercycle For Sale"" and could you put ""Top Quality"" in bold...? You can't? OK whatever."
14249,RANGER PARK,"I-I gotta call you back.  Alright, questions?"
14250,SAL,Yeah. Have yous ever seens Bigfeet?
14251,RANGER PARK,Technically no. But I do see him each night in my dreams and each day in the silent faces of hairy children.
14252,FARNSWORTH,(shouting) Bunk! Bunk I say! Bring me a bag full of Bigfoot's droppings or shut up!
14253,FARNSWORTH,Shut up!
14254,BENDER,Oh my God its Bigfoot!
14255,RANGER PARK,Where?
14256,BENDER,Eh he's gone. He says you should keep wasting your life though.
14257,PETUNIA,Oh! I saw Bigfoot crushing cars at the county fair!
14258,RANGER PARK,What you saw was Bigfoot the monster truck. But thanks for a great question.
14259,PETUNIA,Ohh...
14260,FRY,"Sir, if I may, why don't you set up like a billion video cameras in the woods and see if he walks by one."
14261,RANGER PARK,"Ah, that would be very expensive. And most people who believe in Bigfoot are broke."
14262,BENDER,Hey look! Bigfoot! He's back!
14263,RANGER PARK,Where?
14264,BENDER,Up your face!  Everybody do the Bender!
14265,AMY,The sky out here is amazing. Look at all those satellites.
14266,FARNSWORTH,Goodnight employess.
14267,HERMES,Goodnight.
14268,ZOIDBERG,Goodnight Hubert.
14269,FRY,You doin' alright out there buddy?
14270,BENDER,Better than these gnats!  That guy won't be goin' home to his kids!
14271,BENDER,"Who's that? A wolf? Or some kind of boogen? Oh God I wish I was safe inside a tent.  (deep voice) Fry, Fry wake up! It's me! Bigface!"
14272,FRY,Bigfoot? Bigfoot?
14273,FRY,"Bigfoot? Is that you? I'm not like the others Bigfoot. I see through your monster coatings to the gentle loner inside. I bet you have a wounded racoon friend that you tenderly nurse back to health and go......and in the end they shoot you. But you teach us about things. Oh, it's a flying saucer. (shouting) Excuse me? You can't park here. The parking area's over there.  Wow nice tube!  Hey. Hey what's the big idea? Stop abducting me. Why does your vanity plate say ""Probe 1""?"
14274,LEELA,"There's nothing so refreshing as the clean, crisp taste of old Canadian beer!"
14275,HERMES,"Well, see you in an hour. I gotta go do some business behind that tree."
14276,AMY,"Bender, wasn't that Fry's tent?"
14277,LEELA,"Bender raises a good point, where is Fry?"
14278,FRY,"Amy, you won't believe what happened......it was so scary that you wouldn't -  I know but listen it gets even scarier."
14279,FARNSWORTH,Fry! What in Sega Genesis happened to you?
14280,FRY,That's what I'm trying to tell you. See -  Why are you all staring at me like that? Is there something on my face?
14281,HERMES,Uh...no.
14282,LEELA,Someone should tell him.
14283,FRY,Tell me what?
14284,LEELA,Nothing.
14285,ZOIDBERG,"Well I have a lot of experience telling patients bad news so, let me break it to him gently.  (shouting) Fry you have no nose! Your nose is gone! You have no nose on your face! Where it is I can't say but on your face it's not!"
14286,FRY,What?
14287,BENDER,"Aww, I think it's sweet! You chopped off your nose so you could look more like your hero. Me, Bender!"
14288,FARNSWORTH,Which last night?
14289,FRY,"In the woods, I was walking. For Bigfoot, looking and then aliens beamed me up."
14290,AMY,Were they little grey dudes with big oval heads?  I don't get that gesture. Am I wrong?
14291,ZOIDBERG,Cheer up friend. When we get home a high quality prosthesis will have you looking good as new.
14292,FRY,I'm a pathetic freak. My life is ruined.
14293,HERMES,"Man, you are such a jokester!"
14294,FRY,I'll never have another moment of happiness.
14295,LEELA,I know you're trying to mask your pain with humour but don't worry. I'm sure the Professor can clone you a new nose.
14296,FARNSWORTH,Well there's no sense fretting. Good Lord you're ugly! The fact is your nose is gone and we'll never find out who did it or why.
14297,BENDER,"(gasping) Guys, guys! There's something on television."
14298,LINDA [ON TV],"Alien abductions: Until now, a harmless nuisance. But recently they've taken on a sinister dimension as unsuspecting victims are returned...without noses!"
14299,FRY,Like me!
14300,MORBO [ON TV],"The culprits: Shameless poachers, hunting humans without a permit."
14301,LINDA [ON TV],"The valuable nose or ""human horn"" fetches a high price on alien worlds as an aphrodisiac."
14302,FRY,My nose is an aphrodisiac?  I'm gonna drop a barf!
14303,MORBO [ON TV],Demand for human horn is great. Due in part to titilating scenes from depraved alien TV programmes too filthy for Earth broadcast. Let's watch.
14304,FRY,Blech! We have to track down my nose before some alien snarfs it and does the worm. Who's in?
14305,LEELA,Me and Bender and maybe Zoidberg if he feels like it.
14306,ZOIDBERG,No I'm good.
14307,ALIEN,"Lets see, I'll have a pancreas, two sphincters and a large colon."
14308,FRY,"It's no use. We've been to ever scuzzy bazaar in the galaxy, including Pottery Barn."
14309,LEELA,"Wait, what's that?"
14310,SALESMAN,Welcome friends. How may I pervert you?
14311,FRY,"Uh, I'm looking for human horn."
14312,SALESMAN,(whispering) Shh! You're not cops right?
14313,LEELA,Of course not. In fact he's a crook.
14314,BENDER,Yep. Stolen Pez anyone?
14315,SALESMAN,Right this way.
14316,SALESMAN,Human horn. So fresh you can still see the eyeglass marks.
14317,FRY,"Nope, uh-uh, eww!  Now look, this is the nose we want. Did you sell it to somebody?"
14318,SALESMAN,"I'm sorry sir but due to the perverted nature of our business, customer records are strictly confidential.  Right this way."
14319,SALESMAN,"I video tape everyone who comes in here so I can blackmail them later.  Hey, I'm a porno dealing monster, what do I care what you think? Here's the weirdo who bought your horn."
14320,LEELA,That's Lrrr! Ruler of the planet Omicron Persei 8!
14321,LRRR [ON TV],"You got any uh, you know..."
14322,SALESMAN [ON TV],Speak up! You're muttering!
14323,LRRR [ON TV],I said uh... (whispering) human horn?
14324,LRRR [ON TV],"Oh no no, I'm just some guy. Ruler of the planet Omicron Persei 8!"
14325,LRRR,"So let me get this straight: If I buy eight caramello bars, you all get to go to some camp."
14326,BENDER,Yep. That's exactly the lie we used to get past your guards.
14327,FRY,Oh great space king. I humbly beg you to return my human horn.
14328,LRRR,"Uh, human horn? How ridiculous! Why would virile male like Lrrr need human horn? I don't even know what it's for. What is it, something you-you put in salad dressing?"
14329,ND-ND,Like you've ever seen a salad.
14330,LRRR,My weight is appropriate and attractive!
14331,LEELA,"Whoa, you guys have issues!"
14332,LRRR,"She has issues! I'm fine! But there's no human horn around here so, make friends with the door."
14333,FRY,(sadly) Alright. I give up. I guess I'll just go home and marry a skunk.
14334,ND-ND,Oh let's just give it to him.  Here.
14335,FRY,My nose! Light of my face!
14336,LRRR,"Uh, what is that? How do you have that Nd-Nd?  I've never seen it before. My friend left it here."
14337,LEELA,Hold still Fry. I can reattach it with my emergency face laser.
14338,FRY,Hey! You burned my cheek!
14339,LEELA,Yeah sorry I wasn't really concentrating.
14340,FRY,"No I mean the singed flesh, I can smell it!  Those lilacs on the table."
14341,LRRR,At least someone noticed.
14342,ND-ND,For the last time I don't like lilacs! Your first wife was the one who liked lilacs.
14343,LRRR,She also liked to shut up!
14344,FRY,"Well, great seeing you, I guess we'll be on our -"
14345,BENDER,"Yo, highness! Uh, just out of robo-curiosity, why would you use a guy's nose for an aphrodisiac instead of his...you know...wing dang doodle?"
14346,LRRR,But I thought the horn was the human wing dang doodle?
14347,BENDER,"No sir-chee! The main event, so to speak, is downstairs near the wallet. Ever seen soccer players line up to block a free kick? They ain't covering their noses I'll say that much! Well, seeya!"
14348,LRRR,Interesting. The trousers conceal a tiny secondary horn.
14349,FRY,"Hey, what've you heard?"
14350,LRRR,(shouting) Guards! Seize him!  Prepare to harvest the lower horn!
14351,FRY,"OK, you can have my nose."
14352,LRRR,Guards!
14353,GUARD #1,Yeah?
14354,LRRR,Remove the human's lower horn and prepare it to be eaten by me.
14355,ND-ND,In other words slop a lot of ketchup and salt on it!
14356,LRRR,Then bring it to our royal bedchamber and put it in the sock drawer with all the other things that have failed to arouse my passion for this woman.
14357,GUARD #2,Remove pants!
14358,FRY,Wait! I'm usually the first guy to toot my own lower horn -
14359,BENDER,(shouting) I'll say!
14360,FRY,But in this case I just don't think it'll do any good.
14361,BENDER,(shouting) That's what she said!
14362,LEELA,Let's face it. You two have deep relationship problems that can't be solved by an aphrodisiac.
14363,FRY,However huge it might be.
14364,ND-ND,"So what do you suggest, painfully single human?"
14365,LEELA,"Well, why don't you think back to what brought you together in the first place?"
14366,ND-ND,Ohh I don't know. Lrrr used to be so tender.
14367,LRRR,I only wrote that poem to test my printer.
14368,ND-ND,We'd go walking in the woods and Lrrr would find injured little tinkle-bunnies and nurse them back to health.
14369,LRRR,Yes but I'm the one who injured them!
14370,ND-ND,Oh shush. You stepped on them by accident and then you cried all night. That's the kind of sensitive man you used to be.
14371,LRRR,And you used to wear a size-3 cape. (shouting) But not anymore! Now bring me that lower horn while I'm still in the mood.
14372,FRY,Wh-What if we helped you get your passion back without the hassle of mutilating me?
14373,LEELA,"Yeah, we know a great place in the mountains. We could take you there for a romantic dinner under the stars."
14374,ND-ND,"Hmm, sounds interesting. But he would never do it."
14375,LRRR,Like hell I wouldn't. I'm not gonna be blamed for not going!
14376,FRY,Then it's a deal. We get one night. I keep my horn as long as you two end up doing the horizontal monster mash.
14377,BENDER,I don't get it!
14378,BENDER,Bonjour. May I offer you a box of wine for the edge of the table?
14379,LRRR,No thanks. Just water please. Tap water!
14380,ND-ND,(sarcastic) Oh big spender!
14381,LRRR,"(shouting) That's it, this date is over! Waiter!"
14382,FRY,"So, what can I get you this evening?"
14383,LRRR,Your lower horn!
14384,FRY,"I'll just start you off with some bread. Some sexy, arousing bread!"
14385,LRRR,Fine but none of that whole-grain goat food! And bring plenty of melted butter.
14386,ND-ND,Why don't you just inject some fat straight into your ass and cut out the middle man!
14387,LRRR,"One of these days Nd-Nd, bang, zoom, straight to the third moon of Omicron Persei 8!"
14388,LRRR [EATING],"Mmm, this jerked chicken is good! I think I'll have Fry's lower horn jerked."
14389,BENDER,(shouting) It's used to it!
14390,FRY,"So uh, how are you two sneaky poopums doing?"
14391,ND-ND,Poorly.
14392,LRRR,My wife is right for once. There is very little magic in the air. Ready the lower horn transport vessel.
14393,BENDER,"Boy, who knew a cooler could also make a handy wang coffin?  Hey, uh mind if I stick these in here?"
14394,GUARD #1,Go for it.
14395,LEELA,Don't worry Fry. Things look bad but I still have a trump card. The most beautiful love song ever written.  (singing badly) And I will always love you......will always love you...
14396,ND-ND,The humans are attacking.
14397,LRRR,Pluck the lower horn and let's get out of here!
14398,BENDER,"Quick Fry, run for it!"
14399,FRY,"Come on freedom cage! Roll me to safety! Yes! I never thought I'd escape with my doodle, but I pulled it out!"
14400,BENDER,(shouting) Just like at the movie theatre!
14401,LRRR,Give me that!
14402,FRY,Bigfoot! He's real! I knew it. The Loch Ness Monster's book was right!
14403,LRRR,"Well, hello there my furry friend."
14404,ND-ND,Look at his adorable little feet.  Yes you are a cutie-pie.
14405,RANGER PARK,Holy macaroni!  I can't believe I'm seeing Bigfoot! He's in focus! Oh I've waited my entire life for this moment!
14406,BENDER,What are you doing with that?
14407,LRRR,You're going to kill this innocent giganto?
14408,RANGER PARK,Of course not. I'm just gonna tranquilise him so I can chop off his feet as proof he exists. Then dump him back in the wild. He'll do fine.
14409,LRRR,You'll have to get through me first.
14410,RANGER PARK,"OK, nighty nght."
14411,LRRR,Now leave this gentle sasquatch - or wood ape - in peace so I can finally and at long last harvest this pathetic human's lower horn.
14412,FRY,Yeah!
14413,LRRR,"Wait. What am I saying? If I poach this beast's lower horn, am I any better than that ranger with his demented foot lust? Yes. But not by enough."
14414,RANGER PARK,Score!
14415,LRRR,"This human's lower horn is one of God's creatures, a living thing. And all living things, large and small..."
14416,BENDER,"(shouting) In this case ""small""!"
14417,LRRR,...have diginity. And a spark of divine.
14418,ND-ND,That's the gentle sensitive poet warlord I fell in love with!
14419,LRRR,"(shouting) Uh, you'll wanna retreat to a safe, 500 metre radius!"
14420,LEELA,"Well Fry, it looks like you get to hold onto your lower horn."
14421,BENDER,As usual!  (shouting) Run away!
14422,SCIENTIST [ON TV],"I have combined the DNA of the world's most evil animals, to make the most evil creature of them all."
14423,MAN [ON TV],It turns out it's Man.
14424,FUTURAMA,
14425,"""BEND HER""",
14426,FRY,So who should I root for? America or one of those countries I learned about at the Food Court?
14427,AMY,How 'bout those guys?
14428,LEELA,"No, they're from the Republic Of French Stereotypes. Everybody hates them."
14429,FARNSWORTH,"Oh, let's go check on Hermes. All this inspiring multi-culturalism is angrying up my blood.  Sweden? I don't think so!"
14430,HERMES,"Go on stick, touch me! Can't do it!"
14431,LABARBARA,"Husband, you haven't been an Olympic class limboer for 20 years! Quit lying to your podgy self."
14432,LEELA,It does seem like Jamaica will be able to field a strong limbo team without you.
14433,AMY,"Yeah, isn't that basically all Jamaicans do?"
14434,HERMES,Jamaicans have other interests. Which is why the limbo team got detained at the airport.
14435,LABARBARA,That's when they begged my husband to step in and make an ass out of himself.
14436,HERMES,And I said I'd try my very best.
14437,FRY,"But have they seen your...y'know...physique, since the old days?"
14438,HERMES,"I described it to them on the phone, using a series of artful euphanisms."
14439,FARNSWORTH,"Don't worry, the fat pig will do fine thanks to this flabbo-dynamic spandex bodysuit I've designed.  It redistributes his weight, shifting his centre of gravity closer to his knees."
14440,HERMES,"Ooo, that's snug!  Oh, those haven't descended in years."
14441,FARNSWORTH,Now that's a limboer's body!
14442,LABARBARA,You're that fine Jamaican bacon!
14443,BENDER,"Shut up Zoidberg, the robot bending events are starting!  Something tells me I could easily beat those trained professionals."
14444,BENDER,"Wow, that guy must have to be like the world's greatest bender. My dreams of glory died before they began."
14445,ZOIDBERG,Welcome to my life!
14446,BARBADOS SLIM,Hermes Conrad. Is that you inside that dumpy little fat man?
14447,HERMES,Barbados Slim! What are you doing here? Last time I heard you were in Barbados.
14448,BARBADOS SLIM,Yes and I'll be going back there with a gold medal draped around my elegant Carribean shoulders.
14449,HERMES,"Your body may be as perfectly scultpted as it was 20 years ago when you whupped my fat ass every time we met......but today, I feel lucky."
14450,BARBADOS SLIM,I see you're still able to limbo under the bar of fashion sense!
14451,HERMES,"That's it Barbados Slim, you've gone one talk over the line!"
14452,STARTER,"Limboers, on your marks, get rubbery......limbo!"
14453,COMMENTATOR,"(voice-over) There they go, and Barbados Slim takes an early lead. God I hope he wins.  What's this? Hermes Conrad is closing the gap. He's limboed out of retirement and straight into my heart. I say go to hell Barbados Slim!"
14454,FARNSWORTH,"(shouting) Go bodysuit, go!"
14455,ZOIDBERG,(shouting) Go!
14456,BENDER,(shouting) C'mon!
14457,LABARBARA,"(shouting) C'mon Hermes, beat that mahogany god!"
14458,COMMENTATOR,"(voice-over) It's Barbados, then Conrad. Conrad pulls ahead!  And Conrad is disqualified! Barbados Slim, my hero, takes the gold!"
14459,LABARBARA,"Aww, there there Hermes.  You did your best! If I'd wanted a human Adonis for a husband, I'd have stayed married to Barbados Slim."
14460,BENDER,"Well enough about Hermes, I couldn't win a medal either. Even at bending - the thing I was built to do. I'm so embarassed. I wish everybody else was dead."
14461,FEMALE ANNOUNCER,"Up next, the Fembot bending competition."
14462,BENDER,"Fembots?  Methinks a clever Manbot suitably disguised might win those events! But the charade would require subtlety, nuance, grace."
14463,BENDER,"What do you mean I'm not registered? My name is Coilette and I'm from, uh...Robonia! Coilette's a chick's name!"
14464,OFFICIAL,"Yes but ""Robonia"" sounds like something somebody made up on the spot."
14465,BENDER,Ever been beaten up by a guy dressed like a chick?
14466,MALE ANNOUNCER,And it's straight! Coilette wins!
14467,MALE ANNOUNCER,Another gold medal for the spunky maid from Robonia.
14468,MALE ANNOUNCER,"A perfect bend and a flawless entry. No splash at all!  Perfect scores, a record five gold medals for Coilette!"
14469,BENDER,"I'm great! Everybody else sucks, except that guy Bender, he's really somethin'!"
14470,LEELA,You actually thought they'd let you walk away without an engine oil sex check?
14471,BENDER,"(crying) Oh God, I'm not gonna get my medals! They're all I have to remember my Olympic career.  Wait, I've got it! Professor, make a woman out of me!"
14472,FARNSWORTH,Oh I think we should just stay friends.
14473,BENDER,"I don't need friends, I need a sex change operation and give it to me now!"
14474,FARNSWORTH,Bender a robot sex change is a complex and dangerous procedure. Replacing your testosteroil with Fembot lubricants can cause wild mood swings. And the effects may be irreversible. Well let's get started!
14475,LEELA,"No, you can't!"
14476,AMY,If you have even the slightest respect for the dignity of women -
14477,BENDER,Pfft.
14478,FARNSWORTH,"I'm sorry ladies but I must do this. Not for you, not for Bender, but for the proud people of Robonia!"
14479,BENDER,(whispering) C'mon!
14480,FRY,I can't watch this 'cause it's creepy and wrong and sick. However I will watch out of curiosity.
14481,FARNSWORTH,(shouting) Quiet! (talking) I'm about to begin the process of reshaping Bender's body into a tender delicate form.
14482,FARNSWORTH,(dramatically) Draining male oil.  Infusing female oil.  Removing item.
14483,ROBOT,We can't wait for Coilette any longer dammit. I have to get home to watch The Zombie Osbournes.
14484,COILETTE,I'm ready for my test now boys.
14485,COILETTE,"(singing) Hail, hail Robonia, a land I didn't make up!"
14486,COILETTE [ON TV],Ooo yeah c'mon baby boom!
14487,COILETTE,Oh yeah baby c'mon! Work your can! That's it shake it out!
14488,LEELA,"I don't know which I'm more, enraged or disgusted!"
14489,COILETTE,I'm just out there making us ladies look good.
14490,AMY,Snuh-uh! You're making us look like jerks in front of the other genders.
14491,FRY,But you're not really a lady anyway. Right?
14492,COILETTE,Of course not.
14493,FARNSWORTH,"Dear Lord, a coaster! The Femzoil must be sacheting girlishly into your processor."
14494,COILETTE,Then change me back. My breasts are keeping me awake at night anyway.  Hello...? What...? A guest spot on Late Night With Humorbot 5.0...? I'd love to! My own limo...? No I don't have my own limo. You'd better send one.  I need a raincheck on that nad-swap Professor. I'm going on TV. C'mon Fry help me pick out a pantsuit!
14495,HUMORBOT 5.0,"So Calculon, do you want to set up this clip from All My Circuits?"
14496,CALCULON,No I think it's self-explanatory.
14497,CALCULON,"Funny story, the script called for me to say ""yes"" but I gave it a little twist."
14498,HUMOUBOT 5.0,"Anecdote accepted. Snappy comeback not found. Please put your hands together for my next guest. Winner of five Olympic medals - Coilette from Robonia.  So Coilette, many young Fembot's wish to emulate you. Any advice for them?"
14499,COILETTE,"Yes Humorbot. If you ask me, women today are too stuck up to go out and jiggle their jello like everybody wants them to. In fact, should I do it now?  Alright then!  Woo! Look out baby! Work it out! Oo shake that thing! You gotta use it lady! Shake it up a little! Look at that! C'mon! Work it out!"
14500,CALCULON,"Madam, I am one impressed celebrity."
14501,COILETTE,Oh I bet you say that to all the five Olympic gold medal winning Fembots!
14502,CALCULON,(sexfully) From this day forward I shall do so whenever possible.
14503,COILETTE,Golly...what?
14504,CALCULON,Coilette this may be presumtuous....
14505,COILETTE,That's my favourite kind of this!
14506,CALCULON,...but I would be honoured if you would join me for dinner sometime.
14507,COILETTE,Calculon. You'd be fulfilling this naive Robonian farmgirl's fantasy!
14508,CALCULON,Of course I would.
14509,COILETTE,This top makes me look fat. Is it trampy to go on a first date nude?
14510,AMY,Yes.
14511,COILETTE,Perfect.
14512,FRY,You gotta tell me. You're not actually attracted to Calculon right? And if you are don't tell me. Are you?
14513,COILETTE,Certainly not. But just once I'd like to eat dinner with a celebrity who isn't bound and gagged. Is that so much to ask?
14514,LEELA,Well I think you dating a Manbot is a disgrace. And I refuse to be involved. And you have way too much lipstick on.
14515,COILETTE,Are you kidding? I need more lipstick! Much more!  Ooo yeah that's the stuff! Men love it when you really glob it on!
14516,LEELA,No they don't.
14517,AMY,No way!
14518,COILETTE,"Oh please. Every man wants a tramp! No wonder you girls aren't married! I tell you, men are so much better at being women."
14519,FRY,"But what if he wants to, I mean if he tries to...uh...Barry White?"
14520,COILETTE,I'll just tell him I needed commitment first. That'll stick a potato in his tailpipe!
14521,HERMES,Good Lord man what kind of temporary woman are you?
14522,COILETTE,"Look, why don't all of you just back off? Can't a girl enjoy herself without being judged?"
14523,FARNSWORTH,"Oh dear. Her mood swings are getting wilder. She's becoming a slave to her emotions. Just like all women, particularly you Leela."
14524,LEELA,I'm worried about him too Professor.
14525,ELZAR,"Hey ma'am, you sure can put it away! You saved me a trip to the dump! Bam!"
14526,CALCULON,I'd appreciate it if you didn't bam the young lady.
14527,ELZAR,"Well, I'd appreciate it if I did, so I guess we're even."
14528,CALCULON,"You know Coilette, I've never before met a woman as fascinating as I am. You're such a sweet, soft Fembot. And you have this free spirit about you. And there it is. It's as if you understand the male mind better than I!  I've never met anyone like you."
14529,COILETTE,Oh yes you have.
14530,CALCULON,Coilette. I'd like to spend some (whispering) quality time with you.
14531,COILETTE,"What? Ahh! Whoa, no way! Not gonna happen. What kind of girl do you think I am?"
14532,CALCULON,Have I mentioned that I own the world's biggest and most elegant yacht?
14533,COILETTE,Woo! I'm a trophy girlfriend!
14534,AMY,No kidding. These gifts have been coming non-stop!  I think Calculon's falling for you.
14535,COILETTE,Bah. Any day now he'll dump me for a new wad of arm candy. And then I can turn back into a guy and hock all this stuff! It's just a game.
14536,CALCULON,"Coilette, I can't stop thinking about you. I can't sleep at night - although as a robot I don't do that anyway. But if I did I couldn't because I love you so.  Oh my darling......Will you marry me?"
14537,COILETTE,"Oh Calculon, yes I will!"
14538,AMY,(whispering) Maybe she's right about the lipstick.
14539,FRY,I'll miss you buddy. You've been like a brother and then a sister to me. And now you're getting married. I love you.
14540,COILETTE,The marriage is a scam.
14541,FRY,Cool. What's for dinner?
14542,LEELA,What do you mean a scam?
14543,COILETTE,"I marry Calculon, divorce him, take half his money and turn back into a guy. It's sort of a two-person pyramid scheme."
14544,FRY,That's marriage alright!
14545,LEELA,That is so unbelievably manipulative.
14546,COILETTE,"Come on, you never went on a date with a guy just 'cause you were hungry?"
14547,LEELA,Well I...uh...I thought I might like him on a full stomach.
14548,COILETTE,"Nice try sister. Now if you'll excuse me, I need to meet with my wedding planner. (shouting) Zoidberg.  (talking) Zoidypoo, please tell me frilly is in this year."
14549,ZOIDBERG,I saw a frilly cake in here you would remember all your life. I know I will. Late at night it haunts me with it's frosted beauty. (shouting) Order the cake dammit!
14550,CALCULON,I have something for you.
14551,COILETTE,A remote control? You got me a TV?
14552,CALCULON,"No my dearest, it's the remote control to my heart! It symbolises the power you have to sway my emotions."
14553,COILETTE,Will it work on my TV?
14554,CALCULON,"We don't need TVs, we have each other! Coilette if I weren't able to spend my life with you I would leap from this very balloon."
14555,COILETTE,Come on now - really?
14556,CALCULON,Yes! We were meant (dramatically) to be!
14557,COILETTE,So...you really and truly love me?
14558,CALCULON,So much so that I'm prepared to give up showbusiness itself to be with you!
14559,COILETTE,"But, you always said you'd rather burn down a convent than give up showbusiness."
14560,CALCULON,I always said many things. But now all I want is a peaceful life and a quiet villa overlooking a vineyard....with you.
14561,COILETTE,(crying) Would we have donkeys?
14562,CALCULON,All you can eat!
14563,COILETTE,(crying) Oh take me in your arms and compress me. Compress me tight!
14564,CALCULON,Stop! Let us climb to the heavens that the gods themselves might embrace!
14565,COILETTE,(crying) I just don't think I can go through with this scam.
14566,AMY,What?
14567,FRY,So now you do wanna marry him?
14568,COILETTE,"(crying) No, I just don't wanna hurt him, or humiliate him. Oh, curse this woman's heart!"
14569,FRY,Eck!
14570,FARNSWORTH,You're falling into the final debilitating stages of womanhood. You've waited too long to switch back you dingbat!
14571,LEELA,OK look. If I help you with this do you promise to get out of my gender and stay out?
14572,COILETTE,(crying) Uh-huh.
14573,LEELA,"Alright. Now there's no way to stop this marriage without hurting Calculon. But he's an actor. If there's one kind of pain he can handle, it's soap opera pain."
14574,LEELA,"(whispering) OK, is everyone ready?"
14575,FRY,Yep.
14576,AMY,Uh-huh.
14577,HERMES,Check!
14578,ZOIDBERG,Impassively.
14579,PREACHERBOT,"Dearly beloved actors and casting people who may be looking for somebody to play a preacher, I welcome you! The bride has written some vows that we will now all pretend to be interested in."
14580,COILETTE,Dearest Calculon. Forever is not enough time to tell you of the many ways I love you.
14581,HEDONISMBOT,Oh my!
14582,CALCULON,Is there a doctor in the -
14583,ZOIDBERG,I came as soon as I could.  It appears to be a case of African Hydraulic Fever!
14584,CALCULON,"Dear God! The very illness my TV character caught in season two, when I was holding out for more money! It's often fatal."
14585,COILETTE,"Whatever happens, remember, the flame of my eternal love will burn forever."
14586,CALCULON,"Of course. But smoochiepups, I thought one could only catch hydraulic fever deep in the diamond mines of the Congo."
14587,LEELA,Coilette! You she-devil!  You really thought you could steal those diamonds from me and Congo Jack?
14588,COILETTE,Those gems belong to the natives!
14589,CALCULON,Oh how cruel and melodramatic fate is. (dramatically shouting) Whhhy?
14590,COILETTE,"Calculon, my darling, your loud ""why"" brought me partway back to life.  Congo Jack!"
14591,CALCULON,Another shocking twist!
14592,FRY,Yes. And I have a message for you from Colonel Mitumba! He says this......is from Congo Jack.
14593,COILETTE,"Uh, um..."
14594,CALCULON,No! Nooo! (dramamtically shouting) N-O-O-O!
14595,COILETTE,I won't leave you. Not until I'm sure you understand the thing I said before. About my eternal love for you burning......et cetera.
14596,CALCULON,(crying) I do. I do.
14597,COILETTE,OK then.
14598,ZOIDBERG [EATING],"I'm a doctor, she's dead."
14599,CALCULON,"She lives no more. But let us all find comfort knowing that she truly loved me. To honour my pain, I shall star in a film dedicated to her memory. And this time the Academy will not deny me. Not when they see Coilette: A Calculon Story."
14600,CALCULON [ON TV],"Coilette. Your death fills me wih sorrow, (angry) anger, (fearful) fear, (normal) every emotion an actor can display."
14601,FARNSWORTH,Turn off that crap-o-rama! One mistake now and Bender will be trapped forever between the already ill-defined robot sexes.
14602,COILETTE,"Ow, oo, ow."
14603,FRY,"Well Bender, I hope this has taught you a lesson about changing your sex to win five gold medals."
14604,COILETTE,It truly has. My romance with Calculon has shown me a lot about myself.
14605,FARNSWORTH,Almost done.
14606,COILETTE,"If only somehow, someway he and I could..."
14607,BENDER,"...drive to Vegas, pick up some Flooziebots and void their warranties all night long!"
14608,FRY,Yay my buddy's home! And his respect for women is back to normal.
14609,LEELA,I kind of hope this whole experience would have left you a little more open to your sensitive side.
14610,BENDER,Yeah you'd think but what you gonna do?
14611,CALCULON [ON TV],"Coilette, the skies themselves weep upon the sweetest flower of all the field."
14612,LEELA,Aww!
14613,AMY,Aww!
14614,FRY,Eww!
14615,ZOIDBERG,Gross.
14616,FARNSWORTH,Sentimental drivel-poop.
14617,FRY,C'mon Bender let's go. This chick flick is getting me all barfy.
14618,BENDER,Yeah. Emotions are dumb and should be hated.
14619,CALCULON [ON TV],"Goodnight Coilette, my turtledove."
14620,BENDER,Goodnight Calculon.
14621,LEELA,What did you say?
14622,BENDER,I said you two don't dress trampy enough. I still got it!
14623,THE END,
14624,"""OBSOLETELY FABULOUS""",
14625,MAN,$10 please.
14626,FRY,Aw man!
14627,NANNYBOT 1.0,Sleep little dumpling. I have replaced your mother.
14628,LEELA,Aww!
14629,BENDER,"Oh my God, robot beely-boppers!"
14630,FRY,And there's a robot scratching post. You should try it out Bender.
14631,BENDER,"Please, I have some dignity."
14632,WERNSTROM,"Ladies and gentlemen, my killbot features Lotus notes and a machine gun. It is the finest available."
14633,FARNSWORTH,Like fun it is you glass headed wallaby!
14634,WERNSTROM,No one calls me that. I'm having at you!
14635,FARNSWORTH,Werrrnstrom!
14636,FARNSWORTH'S KILLBOT,Such senseless aggression.
14637,WERNSTROM'S KILLBOT,"C'mon, lets go for a peddleboat ride."
14638,BENDER,The secret is to scratch 'em really really hard!
14639,ANNOUNCER,"And now, the women who Mom-opolises the robot industry..."
14640,FRY,(shouting) I get it!
14641,ANNOUNCER,...Mom!
14642,FRY,"(shouting) Oh, now I get it!"
14643,MOM,Hello dearies.
14644,BENDER,Woo! I love that old bat!
14645,MOM,"Ladies and gentlemen, for the 17th year in a row, the future of robotics has arrived. Boys?  I give you...Robot 1-X!"
14646,LARRY,Ow!
14647,IGNER,Ow! Oh!
14648,BENDER,Neat!
14649,MOM,"Quite frankly, Robot 1-X will put all my previous models to shame. Incidentally, would one of my previous models mind coming up here?"
14650,BENDER,"Right here, I'm comin'! C'mon baby! I'll do it! C'mon Mom!"
14651,TEENBOT,Jerk!
14652,BENDER,"Oo, here we go. I'm your top of the line Mom!"
14653,MOM,Notice that this obsolete robot runs on alcohol and emits pollution. Whereas Robot 1-X runs on pollution and emits pure oxygen with a fresh pine scent.
14654,BENDER,"Man, that smells great!"
14655,MOM,Now lets see how both robots do at a typical household task. Sorting a jar of pocket change.
14656,ROBOT 1-X,Task completed. Total value: $4.73 and one Albanian lek.
14657,MOM,Very good Robot 1-X. And you bending unit?
14658,BENDER,"Uh, I never got the change.  Suckers."
14659,MOM,"Presenting, Mom's Friendly Robots..."
14660,BENDER,That new robot is great huh? Sure made me look like a pile of crap.
14661,FARNSWORTH,Indeed. That's why I bought one to help around the office.
14662,BENDER,(hoarse) Eep!
14663,LEELA,Let's try him out. Robot 1-X? Can you clean Nibbler's skanky litterbox?
14664,ROBOT 1-X,I can and will.
14665,BENDER,Hey I could have done that if you'd asked me.
14666,LEELA,I asked you five minutes ago.
14667,BENDER,You call that a kiss? I'll show you! C'mere Nibbler!
14668,FARNSWORTH,Oh look Bender if you want something to do stop making out and give us a hand.
14669,HERMES,"Here, go up on the roof and install this fake satellite dish so we can impress the neighbours."
14670,BENDER,"Yes sir, I'm on it!"
14671,HERMES,"Oh, and have Robot 1-X help you."
14672,BENDER,"Get outta here freshman, I don't need your help."
14673,ROBOT 1-X,Our owners asked me to assist you.
14674,BENDER,"Yeah, well assist this!"
14675,BENDER,"Ohh! When I screamed ""help"" I didn't mean you!"
14676,ROBOT 1-X,I apologise. However I was able to do your job before I saved your life.
14677,BENDER,Don't mind me. I'm just saving you the trouble of throwing me away.
14678,AMY,Spleesh! Mell out Bender. Come watch some TV.
14679,BENDER,I can't. I'm stuck in the can.
14680,LEELA,"Well, ask Robot 1-X to pull you out."
14681,BENDER,Never!
14682,LEELA,Why can't you accept his help.
14683,BENDER,I hate him.
14684,LEELA,But he's just a tool to make your life easier. Like a socket wrench or a burglars kit.
14685,BENDER,I can't ask for his help because...
14686,FARNSWORTH,Yes?
14687,BENDER,(whispering) I'm scared of him.
14688,LEELA,"Oh, sorry."
14689,FARNSWORTH,Well then there's only one solution. You need an upgrade to make you compatible with Robot 1-X's new technology.
14690,BENDER,"An upgrade? But I thought we all agreed I was perfect! Fry, didn't we agree I was perfect?"
14691,FRY,"Oh yeah, no, you're pretty perfect."
14692,BENDER,"Pretty perfect? So, you do think I need an upgrade."
14693,FARNSWORTH,"Yes for God sakes, yes!"
14694,BENDER,(crying) Fine. I'll be back in a few days.
14695,TV.],
14696,ROBERTO,Man I hate those new 1-X robots. I'd like to stab 'em! Give 'em some of these! Haha! Ha! Haha!
14697,BENDER,"Yeah, right on nutcake!"
14698,ROBERTO,Parole officer says I gotta upgrade or he won't give me back my stabbing knife. But it's no big. I hate those 1-X so much I know it won't affect me. Death to the 1-X robots!  I love those magnificent 1-X robots! The 1-X robots are my friends.
14699,BENDER,"W-W-Wait, what happened to your enthusiasm for stabbing them?"
14700,ROBERTO,I'm past that. Later blood!
14701,BENDER,It's like he's not him anymore.  You took away his robo-humanity!  I changed my mind!
14702,BENDER,"I did it! I escaped! But to what kind of a life?  I'm too scared to get the upgrade but I can't face my friends again without it.  And so I set sail for unknown shores. Oh merciful Poseidon, take pitty on this mechanical mariner. Oh jeez!"
14703,BENDER,(shouting) Curse you merciful Poseideon!
14704,BENDER,"Boy, what is this deal with the ocean? A tropical island huh? Well, I've washed up on worse places. OK, first up, I'm gonna need to build a shelter.  There. Well. I guess I'll go out for a while."
14705,BENDER,Damn. One rock short of rescue!
14706,BENDER,"Oop, low on power!  Better fuel up! Oh no! Guess I'll do what I always do when I run out of booze."
14707,BENDER,"Dont panic, I've got these yams. I'll just make some yam schnapps."
14708,BENDER,Hey I should be mad at you! Now turn around.
14709,BENDER,Beer!  Ow!
14710,BENDER,Ow!
14711,BENDER,Who are you and why should I care?
14712,CARTRIDGE UNIT,"(mechanical voice) Side A. (normal voice) We're a community of outdated robots who refused to upgrade and came here -  (mechanical voice) Side B. (normal voice) - to live a simpler existence, free of technology."
14713,BENDER,A working cartridge unit? Wow! You guys went obsolete years ago!
14714,CARTRIDGE UNIT,Your mother.
14715,WATERBOT,"What Cartridge Unit means is, the very things that make us obsolete also make us unique. I, for example, need to keep filling my waterwheel or I'll power down forever.  (screaming) Oh God, I'll never make it this time! This is the end!  (talking) Anyway, we like it here."
14716,BENDER,Yeah but you have a choice.  What's your problem?
14717,SINCLAIR,Not enough...uh...
14718,BENDER,Memory?
14719,SINCLAIR,Oh great. Now I remember that word but I forgot my wife's face.
14720,WATERBOT,"(screaming) Oh God, no! I want to live! (talking) If you like, you're welcome to join our society."
14721,BENDER,"Look, no offence, but I need technology. Especially email and snowmobiles. And television! Without television how will I know what buzzwords are in?"
14722,SINCLAIR,Why watch TV when you can watch a snail crawl for hours on end?
14723,BENDER,That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.
14724,BENDER,Oh man he's never gonna make it over that next pebble...! Wait...wait...oh my God he made it!
14725,WATERBOT,Yeah!
14726,SINCLAIR,Way to go!
14727,BENDER,That was the greatest thing ever! Lets party!  Yeah baby c'mon!
14728,WATERBOT,Where did you get that CD?
14729,BENDER,It's one of my ten desert island discs. I never even thought I'd get to use them. But look at me now. Ooh yeah baby! Do that thang!
14730,WATERBOT,CD's are unnatural. Why don't you just listen to the ocean?
14731,BENDER,Which ocean? That ocean?
14732,BENDER,Whoa! It's like the earth is making sweet salty love to itself while all the fish groove on it. So much for this garbage.  Take that Beethoven you deaf bastard!
14733,BENDER,Bang bang bang. You sure got this life thing figured out cymbal banging monkey.
14734,WATERBOT,"Hi Bender. We know how you miss technology, so we brought you this washing machine that drifted ashore."
14735,BENDER,Ooo! I'm gonna wash my linen so hard the w -  You-!  Wretched technology has brought me nothing but misery!
14736,CARTRIDGE UNIT,But Bender you are technology. You're the most advanced thing on this entire island.
14737,BENDER,Oh it's true. I am a hideous triumph of form and function.  But not for long!
14738,BENDER [FROM HUT],"Oh, ow that hurt, oh..."
14739,WATERBOT [FROM HUT],The downgrade is complete!
14740,BENDER,Behold my hand crafted purity. The modern world can bite my splintery wooden ass!
14741,WATERBOT,Welcome to your new life of simple tranquility.
14742,BENDER,Pft! Forget that. I say the whole world must learn of our peaceful ways. By force!
14743,CARTRIDGE UNIT,What?!
14744,BENDER,We're going back to civilisation to wage war on technology!
14745,CARTRIDGE UNIT,What?!
14746,BENDER,We'll soon stage an attack on technology worthy of being chronicled in an anthem by Rush!
14747,WATERBOT,We've been sailing for three weeks. Maybe I should check our position with the periscope.
14748,BENDER,Mirrors reflecting mirrors? Hi-tech sorcery! Sorcery I say!
14749,WATERBOT,Did you see anything?
14750,BENDER,"Yep, we're there. Prepare to surface!"
14751,BENDER,"And now, technology shall taste the lash of the hickory switch!"
14752,SINCLAIR,Technology is defeated. Let us return to the island and celebrate by counting rocks!
14753,BENDER,"Whoa, whoa. No-one wants to count rocks more than me. But our mission is not complete. Not so long as Robot 1-X torments me with his obvious superiority. Ready the catapult Sinclair.  Aim for their power lines. The devil weans and electricity is his blood."
14754,WATERBOT,"Bender. If we don't survive the attack, I want you to know...I love you."
14755,BENDER,OK fine. Fire!
14756,FARNSWORTH,(shouting) Oh! I'm blind!
14757,LEELA,"Professor, we have no power."
14758,FARNSWORTH,"What do you mean ""no power""? We're living in the future."
14759,LEELA,I'd better light some candles.
14760,BENDER,Friends. I've come to free you from your complicated lives. Free you from the complicated part I mean not the lives part.
14761,LEELA,Oh Lord he's made of wood! What now Bender?
14762,BENDER,"I got a downgrade! I'm a steam-powered wooden robot - just as nature intended. Therefore, I must kill Robot 1-X."
14763,FARNSWORTH,That's just stupid.
14764,ROBOT 1-X,Does Mr Bender wish me to destroy myself?
14765,BENDER,I don't need your charity.  (shouting) Target Robot 1-X and fire!
14766,FARNSWORTH,You wanged my ship you walnut panelled idiot!
14767,BENDER,"(shouting) Try again Sinclair, I said target Robot 1-X!"
14768,SINCLAIR,Who's Robot 1-X? Launching.
14769,ZOIDBERG,So I guess everything worked out fine.
14770,LEELA,Great. Now we're being crushed.
14771,AMY,Help us wooden Bender!
14772,BENDER,"Heck! Those guys hate fire! I gotta do something.  What the-? Termites? Well, I don't need legs to save my friends. I'll just use the old extentromatic arms!"
14773,HERMES,"Bender, hurry! This fuel's expensive! Also (shouting) we're dying!"
14774,BENDER,"I'm a comin'  Ow! Lousy primative body! Oh, why didn't I get that upgrade? I'm an outdated piece of junk!"
14775,ROBOT 1-X,"Sir, might I recommend -"
14776,BENDER,You shut up. No wait. I can use you as a tool to save my friends and I'll still be the hero who everyone says how great he was!
14777,ROBOT 1-X,How may I help you?
14778,BENDER,Save my friends!  And Zoidberg!
14779,AMY,Look! My hair got singed into an even cuter do!
14780,FRY,Hey where's Bender?
14781,BENDER,Down here.  I'm so sorry guys. I never meant to hurt you. Just to destroy everything you ever believed in.
14782,LEELA,"Well, at least you saved us from, uh, you. Thank God you finally overcame your incompatibility with Robot 1-X."
14783,BENDER,"Oh yeah, we were totally in sync! I was like ""Save them!"" and he was all ""No problem!"" and then he did it..."
14784,BENDER,...This new technology is great!  I love those magnificent 1-X robots. The 1-X robots are my friends!
14785,FATBOT,"It's like his personality is totally different now! Oh, maybe this upgrade isn't such a good idea."
14786,BENDER,I'd like to give Robot 1-X a big smooch on the -  Hey! What's the dilly-o?
14787,UPGRADER,Your upgrade is complete.
14788,BENDER,But I destroyed the technology of the world. I ran on the beach and felt the sand between my foot cups.
14789,UPGRADER [SHRUGGING],Everyone experiences the upgrade differently.
14790,BENDER,"Oof. If that stuff wasn't real, how can I be sure anything is real? Is it not possible, nay probable, that my whole life is just a product of my or someone else's imagination?"
14791,UPGRADER,"No, get out.  Next."
14792,BENDER,"Well, I guess reality is what you make of it.  Oh, thanks baby!"
14793,THE END,
14794,"""BENDER SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED ON TV""",
14795,CALCULON [ON TV],Why Antonio?
14796,MONIQUE [ON TV],Calculon?! But I thought you were -
14797,CALCULON [ON TV],Egyptian?!
14798,MONIQUE [ON TV],"Before I kill you, I must ask you one question. Who am I? For I have...amnesia!"
14799,CALCULON [ON TV],Let me get this straight. Does anyone here not have amnesia?
14800,MONIQUE [ON TV],Not sure.
14801,HUMAN FRIEND [ON TV],I 'unno.
14802,CUBERT,This show is awesome! When I grow up I'm gonna have so much amnesia!
14803,DWIGHT,"Me too. I mean, I have it now, but I forgot."
14804,CUBERT,Well mine's louder!
14805,BENDER,Cram a ham in it you twerps!  Sorry!
14806,FRY,"Nah, I had it coming."
14807,CALCULON [ON TV],Welcome swingers. Pull up a groove and get fabulous!
14808,MONIQUE [ON TV],"Nude rocks bands, big piles of what I assume is talcum powder, it's quite a birthday party Calculon."
14809,CUBERT,Cool! I'm gonna have a fabulatious birthday party just like Calculon!
14810,DWIGHT,Oh yeah? Well I'm gonna show up looking good. Just like Monique.
14811,LEELA,Do you two have to imitate everything you see on TV?
14812,CUBERT,"Um, we're 12, so, yes."
14813,DWIGHT,"Hold up Cubert, you're a clone of the Professor. Do clones even have birthdays?"
14814,CUBERT,Well duh!
14815,DWIGHT,"""Duh"" what?"
14816,CUBERT,Dad? Do I have a birthday?
14817,FARNSWORTH,"Hmm, you didn't have a birth so technically, no.  Oh, don't feel bad. We can celebrate the day I extracted you from the cloning tank. Or the day I scraped that DNA from that growth on my back."
14818,CUBERT,"Ooo, that one!"
14819,FARNSWORTH,Ah yes. It was 13 years ago next week. I used this very fork.
14820,HERMES,Aww well isn't that - ew!
14821,DWIGHT,"Hey, next week'll be my birthday too."
14822,HERMES,That's true. If only there were a way to have one party for both of you here at the office then write it off as a business expense. Wait! I thought of a way! The way I just said!
14823,CUBERT,Yeah!
14824,DWIGHT,Way to go pops!
14825,CALCULON [ON TV],"Oh Monique, why did we wait so many years to bathe in champagne?"
14826,ANTONIO [ON TV],"Father, I've discovered the shocking secret mother has kept from you for 200 years."
14827,MONIQUE [ON TV],No! No!
14828,ANTONIO [ON TV],"Brace yourself. For when I speak these words you may well suffer an attack of explosive amnesia. For you see, the horrible secret is -"
14829,BENDER,Whoever's directing this is a master of suspense!
14830,SAL,He's busteds. Lets get hims outta heres.
14831,FRY,This show's been going downhill since season three.
14832,ZOIDBERG,"Look who's here everyone! It's Zoidberg, the lovable tramp!"
14833,LEELA,Since when are you performing at children's parties?
14834,ZOIDBERG,"Performing? What? Please, if someone could spare me money to buy shoes -"
14835,DWIGHT,This party pukes.
14836,CUBERT,Yeah! The guests were supposed to be here three hours ago.
14837,FARNSWORTH,Well that doesn't mean that no one is coming and that you two are total losers. Who gave you that idea?
14838,DWIGHT,All right! They must've all come as a group.
14839,CUBERT,Welcome swingers! Pull up a groove and get fabulous!
14840,TINNY TIM,Good day fellows. Someone dumped this invitation in my begging cup. Happy growth-scraping day to all!
14841,HERMES,Fire 'em all.
14842,FARNSWORTH,"Mm-hm, mm-hm."
14843,BENDER,"(gasping) Guys, guys something's happening on television again."
14844,MORBO [ON TV],"Welcome to Entertainment And Earth Invasion Tonite. Across the galaxy my people are completing the mighty space fleet that will exterminate the human race! But first, this news from Tinseltown."
14845,LINDA [ON TV],"Following Antonio Calculon Jr's breakdown on set, the popular TV show All My Circuits will hold an open casting call for child robots to replace him."
14846,BENDER,An open casting call for child robots? Tinny Tim? Are you thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?
14847,TINNY TIM,What's that sir?
14848,BENDER,"That I, Bender, am perfect for the role!"
14849,TINNY TIM,You raised my hopes and dashed them quite expertly sir!  Bravo!
14850,LEELA,"Bender, your swarthy Latin charm will only get you so far. There's a lot of famous child acting units here."
14851,FRY,"Look, there's Macaulay Culckon."
14852,LEELA,He's just not cute since he got puberty installed.
14853,FRY,Psst. There's that robot child actor who grew up an robbed a convenience store!
14854,LEELA,And there's that robot child actor who grew up and became a convenience store!
14855,ROBBERBOT,Lottery ticket please.
14856,CASTING DIRECTOR,We're ready for the first audition. (reading) Emoteitron Jr?
14857,MOMBOT,"Hold on precious, let's make you look nice for the lady.  What's this?  What did I tell you?  No more hanging wires!"
14858,CASTING DIRECTOR,"In this scene, you've just found out your real father is Calculon's fourth evil identical septuplet, Sleazy Martinez. OK...take us there!"
14859,EMOTITRON JR,"Now that I know the truth father, I must ride south and join the robo-banditos at Veracruz."
14860,CALCULON,"Well, I thought he was good but the audience seems to have turned on him."
14861,CASTING DIRECTOR,But I don't think -
14862,CALCULON,Next!
14863,MACAULAY CULKON,"...at Veracruz, so, if you'll kindly hand me my poncho -"
14864,CALCULON,Sorry kid you're flailing out there. 90 actors and they all got boo-ed. I just wish we could get this Bender I keep hearing about. They say he's the greatest.
14865,CASTING DIRECTOR,Well there is a robot named Bender here but he's much too old -
14866,CALCULON,Send him in forthwith!
14867,BENDER,(shouting) Boo! Not as good as Bender! Boo!
14868,CASTING DIRECTOR,Mr Bender?
14869,CASTING DIRECTOR,Have you ever been on TV before?
14870,BENDER,"Once, when I took those hostages."
14871,CALCULON,I saw that! You were good. Let's hear you audition.
14872,BENDER,Banditos eh? Aw this is great! 'Cause I happen to have a flawless Spanish accent!  (bad Spanish accent) I will say adios Padre! Come Jesus ye faithful. Tonight we eat...guacamole by the El Rio!
14873,CALCULON,"That was so terrible I think you gave me cancer! I don't care how popular you are, you will never work on my show!"
14874,CALCULON,"However, you've got the job. Welcome aboard son!"
14875,BENDER,Fathero!
14876,CALCULON,Bender I'd like you to meet our director......who's name I never learned.
14877,BENDER,Yo! I read the script and I think it would help my character's motivation if he was on fire.
14878,DIRECTOR,"Uh, don't worry 'bout the script baby, we re-wrote your part to better suit your acting abilities."
14879,BENDER,So now my character has a British accent?
14880,DIRECTOR,"No, now your character's in a coma. Get in bed and don't move.  And...action!"
14881,BENDER,(muttering) Stupid dumb coma...coulda been British.
14882,CALCULON,"Alas that mine only son should sink into an irreversible, permanent...coma."
14883,BENDER,(quietly) Permanent? That's completely out of character for Antonio. I'm gettin' up.
14884,CALCULON,Curse the tragic wildebeast accident that -
14885,BENDER,"Hey everyone! Antonio here but you can call me ""Bender""! I got ants in my butt and I needs to strut.  C'mon baby! C'mon!"
14886,CALCULON,I'm not familiar with the type of thing I'm seeing.
14887,BENDER,"Bite my shiny metal ass!  Ooo yeah! C'mon baby, do that, oo yeah!"
14888,DIRECTOR,(shouting) Cut!  That's the worst coma acting I've ever seen. I'll have to shoot it again.
14889,CALCULON,"No! No, no, no I don't do two takes."
14890,DIRECTOR,But this guy was -
14891,CALCULON,"Amateurs like you do two takes, I do one take. Print it, I'll be in my three storey trailer."
14892,BENDER [ON TV],"Bite my shiny metal ass!  Ooo yeah! C'mon baby, c'mon yeah!"
14893,BENDER,Now that's hospital dancing.  Pretty good eh Calcky?
14894,CALCULON,Good? I've seen better acting from extras in Godzilla movies.  I don't even remember shooting this scene.
14895,DIRECTOR,We didn't. That's security camera footage from your dressing room.
14896,CALCULON,He stole the scene and my money? That's it! I demand you fire this felonious ham!
14897,DIRECTOR,The network Execubots are coming!
14898,CALCULON,Dear God!
14899,BETABOT,Presenting the president of the network.
14900,NETWORK PRESIDENT,"Greetings gentlemen, you already know my Execubots. Executive Alpha, programmed to like things that are seen before."
14901,ALPHABOT,Hey hey hey.
14902,NETWORK PRESIDENT,"Executive Beta, programmed to roll dice to determine the fall schedule."
14903,BETABOT,More reality shows.
14904,NETWORK PRESIDENT,"And Executive Gamma, programmed to underestimate middle America."
14905,GAMMABOT,It's funny but is it going to get them off their tractors?
14906,NETWORK PRESIDENT,"Now, who put this obnoxious dancing robot on my network?"
14907,DIRECTOR,We were about to fire him sir.
14908,NETWORK PRESIDENT,"Silence hack! We've been monitoring our Nielsen families carefully and during the 12 seconds Bender was on screen, viewer eyeball focus was up 90%."
14909,CALCULON,"Sir, children watch this show. Bender's no role model, he's a filth monger!"
14910,NETWORK PRESIDENT,"At our network, we love filth! Filthy rich that is! Being filthy rich that is!  ""Bite my shiny metal ass"" could be a catchphrase."
14911,ALPHABOT,80% likely.
14912,GAMMABOT,It will play in Peoria.
14913,BETABOT,Gameshows are back.
14914,NETWORK PRESIDENT,"We need this edgy, sweeps-ready robot on our network. Bender? Can you continue to drink, smoke and steal things on"
14915,BENDER,Yes I can.
14916,DWIGHT,"Yo, check out what I jacked from my Dad."
14917,CUBERT,A cigar!
14918,TINNY TIM,Ripping!
14919,DWIGHT,Look! I'm Bender!
14920,HERMES,Ras H. Tafari. What's goin' on here?
14921,FARNSWORTH,The ruffians smoked one of your cigars.
14922,HERMES,That's not a cigar. Uh...and it's not mine!
14923,CUBERT,"Hey Dad, bite my shiny metal ass!"
14924,FARNSWORTH,What? Such an act would be most uncomfortable for both of us! Where did you learn such language?
14925,TINNY TIM,From Bender my good jerkwad.
14926,HERMES,Bender eh? That guy's really startin' to twist my dreads.
14927,BENDER,"OK OK OK, get ready for this part."
14928,ZOIDBERG,"Quiet robot, Bender's on TV."
14929,MONIQUE [ON TV],"Oh Calculon, it's so good to get away from the city and that beastly, yet intriguing, Bender."
14930,BENDER [ON TV],Try this kids at home!
14931,LINDA [ON TV],Is television sensation Bender a bad role model for Earth children?
14932,BENDER,That's crazy.
14933,LINDA [ON TV],"A new protest group, Fathers Against Rude Television, says ""Hell yes!"""
14934,FRY,Pft. What kind of bozos would start a Bender protest group?
14935,FARNSWORTH,Good news everyone. Hermes and I have started a Bender protest group.
14936,ZOIDBERG,That was uncanny.
14937,HERMES,Fathers Against Rude Television don't want our kids watching Bender's high definition filth.
14938,FARNSWORTH,And for what? Some kind of cheap laugh? That's not what F-A-R-T is all about.
14939,HERMES,"No sir, not us FARTers."
14940,BENDER,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. You can't censor me just 'cause I'm an obscenely bad role model."
14941,LEELA,"As unclean as it makes me feel, I agree with Bender. Kids don't turn rotten just from watching TV."
14942,FRY,Yeah. Give a little credit to our public schools.
14943,CUBERT,Our dads are all pumped up on dorkosterum. We're just trying to be cool like Bender.
14944,DWIGHT,"Yeah, and it's not even working. Smoking and drinking make us barf."
14945,TINNY TIM,Gentle jerkwads. I know how to emulate Bender without barfing. We could commit a burglary.
14946,DWIGHT,"Hey, yeah!"
14947,CUBERT,Bender loves to burgle!
14948,DWIGHT,Hold up though. Who could we rob? We don't even know anyone with cool stuff.
14949,CUBERT,Duh! We know someone who runs on pure cool fuel. Bender!
14950,DWIGHT,Whoa!
14951,TINNY TIM,We'll rob Bender!
14952,DWIGHT,TV gave us the idea.
14953,CUBERT,OK. It's crime time.
14954,FRY,Hey Bender.  Hey Bender.  Hey Bender. Hey Bender.
14955,FARNSWORTH,What's going on in here?  Oh. Now I'm really outraged.
14956,HERMES,"Where did you requisition this party? And Zoidberg, what are you doing here?"
14957,ZOIDBERG,I'm networking. Let me give you my card.
14958,CUBERT,"Relax Dad, we just invited a few friends over."
14959,FARNSWORTH,Hmm. There's something wrong with your story but I can't put my finger on it. Of course! You don't have friends!
14960,HERMES,Yeah. Why do these popular kids consider you cool all of a sudden?
14961,DWIGHT,Uh...we're just cool is all!
14962,FARNSWORTH,"Balderdash! I'll be the judge of who's cool, using the cool-o-meter!"
14963,COOL-O-METER,Oh yeah!
14964,FARNSWORTH,"Good Lord, I'm getting a reading of over 40 mega-Fonzies!"
14965,HERMES,Everybody out!
14966,ZOIDBERG,"So do you guys know about anything else going on, because I'm totally still ready to party."
14967,HERMES,There's enough cool stuff here to furnish a happenin' pad. Where did it all come from?
14968,TINNY TIM,Don't tell comrades. All for one and one for all!
14969,DWIGHT,We stole it!
14970,TINNY TIM,Oh crumb!
14971,BENDER,What? What's going on?
14972,FARNSWORTH,I'll tell you what. Our boys have taken up stealing! One of the worst and coolest of crimes.
14973,HERMES,And all from watching you on TV you cool jerk.
14974,BENDER,Hey lay off me. TV would stink if everyone on it was a positive role model. Bender is about entertainment baby! You can't hold me responsible for what kids do when - hey! This is my stuff they stole! That's the last straw! Bender should not be allowed on television!
14975,BENDER,Bender must be stopped. I've gone too far. Who does that guy think I am? C'mon! We're gonna march all the way to Hollywood and make them stop forcing their filthy me down our throats.
14976,FART.],
14977,FART MOB,(chanting) Down with Bender! Down with Bender! Down with Bender! Down with Bender!
14978,BENDER,This mob's with me.
14979,SECURITY GUARD,Go ahead.
14980,FART MOB,(chanting) Down with Bender! Down with Bender! Down with Bender! Down with -  - Bender! Down with Bender!
14981,CALCULON,"As a doctor and captain of this hospital shift, I now pronounce you man and wife with six months to live."
14982,FARNSWORTH,Listen up Hollywood. We're an exciting new mob.
14983,BENDER,Yeah!
14984,HERMES,You'd better believe it!
14985,CALCULON,Great Shatner's ghost!
14986,BENDER,We demand that all TVs be equipped with a v-chip that blocks Bender from appearing on the screen.
14987,FARNSWORTH,Booya!
14988,NETWORK PRESIDENT,I'm afraid the answer is a gritty in-your-face no.
14989,BENDER,Then I quit.
14990,NETWORK PRESIDENT,Then you don't quit.  I think you'll be finishing the scene now Mr Bender and don't skimp on the nasty.
14991,FARNSWORTH,There'll be no further nasty.  We still have the option of resorting to violence.
14992,HERMES,What makes you think that'll work?
14993,FARNSWORTH,I saw it on TV in that episode where Bender shot Calculon! How cool is that?
14994,BENDER,Ooo yeah baby c'mon -
14995,FARNSWORTH,Quit the show!
14996,NETWORK PRESIDENT,Do the scene.
14997,FARNSWORTH,I'm a cold blooded punk!
14998,NETWORK PRESIDENT,I once put a laugh track on a sitcom that had no jokes in it.
14999,BENDER,"Hey look, the prop guy has a lamp!"
15000,NETWORK PRESIDENT,Really?
15001,FARNSWORTH,Wha?
15002,BENDER,Aha!
15003,FARNSWORTH,I was using that!
15004,BENDER,"Listen up, 'cause I've got a climactic speech! You, cameraman, keep the camera rolling. You, director, gimmie my motivation."
15005,DIRECTOR,You're angry.
15006,BENDER,"Perfect.  Viewers of the world, do smoking and drinking on TV really make me cool? Of course they do.  How 'bout committing crimes and violence? Again, the answer is ""yes."" But do we really want our kids exposed to that kind of trash on TV? I say absolutely not!  Uh...on the other hand, most - perhaps all the blame rests with the parents. That's right you!  And so I ask you this one question: Have you ever tried simply turning off the TV, sitting down with your children, and hitting them?"
15007,HERMES,(ashamed) We're just so busy.
15008,BENDER,Well make time.
15009,DIRECTOR,And...cut!
15010,CALCULON,Good enough. Splice in some reaction shots of me and shove it on the air.
15011,BENDER [ON TV],"...Have you ever tried simply turning off the TV, sitting down with your children, and hitting them?"
15012,HERMES,"Well, I'd say we all learned a valuable lesson about TV there."
15013,CUBERT,What was it?
15014,FARNSWORTH,"Uh...that we should all take TV a little less seriously. And more importantly, turn it off once in a while."
15015,FRY,Hear hear!
15016,LEELA,Yeah!
15017,BENDER,Damn right!
15018,DWIGHT,"So, should we turn it off now?"
15019,FARNSWORTH,"Well, uh, that depends what's on."
15020,FRY,Nothing good.
15021,FARNSWORTH,Ah let's just keep watching.
15022,BENDER,(singing) TV party tonight!
15023,FARNSWORTH,Wha?
15024,BENDER,(singing) TV party tonight!
15025,FARNSWORTH,Oh!
15026,FRY,(singing) We've got nothing better to do...
15027,LEELA,(singing) ...Than watch TV and have a couple of brews!
15028,ZOIDBERG,(singing) Don't wanna talk about anything else...
15029,FRY,(singing) We don't wanna know!
15030,FARNSWORTH,"(singing) We're dedicated, yes!"
15031,HERMES,(singing) ...To our favourite shows!
15032,CUBERT,All My Circuits
15033,DWIGHT,Everybody Loves Hypno-Toad!
15034,AMY,Scary Door!
15035,LEELA,Blernsmen at Blernsball!
15036,BENDER,Futurama!
15037,"""THE DEVIL'S HANDS ARE IDLE PLAYTHINGS""",
15038,BENDER,Huh?  I choose to not understand these signs.
15039,BENDER,Aha!
15040,FRY,Bender?? I was just not playing the holophonor.
15041,BENDER,Yeah well you should try not stinking at it.
15042,FRY,I am trying. (ashamed) I've been taking lessons.
15043,BENDER,Lessons? Oh that's rich! Isn't it time you gave up all hope of ever improving yourself in any way?
15044,FRY,"I know I should but I just can't. Remember when I had those stomach worms that made me smart? I could play the holophonor and it made Leela like me.  Hey Bender, as long as you know, I have a holophonor recital Tuesday and I'd really like to have somebody there. Please?"
15045,BENDER,Fine I'll go already. Y'know sometimes I wish your real parents were still alive...not often.
15046,BENDER,Whoa...hey!
15047,FRY,Uh...hello Mrs Mellenger.
15048,MRS MELLENGER,Hello Philip.  And you must be Mr Bender. Philip's told me so much about you. Is it true that you're a robot?
15049,BENDER,"I prefer the term ""love machine."""
15050,BENDER,"Wow, your kid is great. How hard did you say you had to hit him?"
15051,MOTHER,Fairly hard.
15052,FRY,The...Grumpy Snail.  Sorry.
15053,KID,(crying) It's too grumpy!
15054,FRY,Ow! No! Quit it! Stop it!
15055,MRS MELLENGER,"Mr Bender, I simply can not teach your child."
15056,BENDER,Then good day madam!  We hope to see you soon for tea.
15057,FRY,It's hopeless. I can hear all this great music in my head but my stupid hands can't keep up.
15058,BENDER,"Aww, you know what always cheers me up? Laughing at other people's misfortunes."
15059,LEELA,"Hey guys, you missed a great delivery to Space Earth. Where you been all afternoon?"
15060,FRY,Uh...a concert.
15061,LEELA,Ooo was it jazz-noodling? My ex-boyfriend Sean played the sax. I used to listen for hours while he sat naked on my couch and improvised.
15062,BENDER,So musicians really Rodger your Hammerstein huh?
15063,LEELA,"Yeah, it's weird. Sean was uneducated, unambitious. He was pastey and hunched..."
15064,FRY,(quietly) Pretty boy.
15065,LEELA,"...But when he played I could sense this incredible, beautiful creative soul. Then one day I found someone else's couch fibres on his butt."
15066,FRY,It could be my beautiful soul sitting naked on her couch if I could just learn to play this stupid thing.
15067,BENDER,"Oh but you can. Although you may have to metaphorically make a ""deal with the devil."" And by ""devil"" I mean ""Robot Devil."" And by ""metaphorically"" I mean ""get your coat."""
15068,ROBOT DEVIL,"God, you hit a sour note about 200 years back Doug!  Let's take it from the top. Ah Bender, Fry. You've come back for more eternal damnation."
15069,BENDER,"No, this isn't a religious visit. Fry just wants holophonor lessons."
15070,FRY,Yep. I need to get really good without practicing.
15071,ROBOT DEVIL,"Hell is full of ten year olds who wanted exactly the same thing. Trouble is, you have what my old music teacher Mrs Mellenger called ""stupid fingers."" With hands like that you'll be lucky to master a belt buckle.  Now wouldn't it be nice if you had a pair of robot hands to replace them?"
15072,FRY,Sure it would.  Oh well. Goodbye.
15073,BENDER,"Fry you smelly idiot, I think he's willing to make some kind of deal with the devil with you."
15074,FRY,"He is?  Great! Wait, what's the catch?"
15075,ROBOT DEVIL,"No catch. I'll merely pick a robot at random from somewhere in the universe - probably one you've never even met - and then I'll remove his hands and switch them for yours.  It's just the sort of guy I am, what do you say?"
15076,FRY,I don't know. It doesn't seem entirely moral to -
15077,BENDER,Fry if you don't take this offer right now I will lose all respect for you and punch you.
15078,FRY,Well...alright. You sure I probably won't know him?
15079,ROBOT DEVIL,Definitely probably not.  Just sign this contract.
15080,BENDER,Wow.
15081,ROBOT DEVIL,And here we go!
15082,BENDER,I got a hundred bucks on Rectal-Exambot!
15083,FRY,Robot Devil? I get your hands? Zam!
15084,ROBOT DEVIL,Oh what an appallingly ironic outcome.
15085,BENDER,It's not ironic it's just coincidental. Now fork over those lady-fingers cookie!
15086,ROBOT DEVIL,Y'know I only put my name on there as a show of good faith for the other robots.
15087,FRY,Stop being such a baby and chop my hands off.
15088,ROBOT DEVIL,Oh very well.
15089,FRY,(impressed) How'd you do that?
15090,ROBOT DEVIL,They're very good hands.
15091,FRY,At last! At last I have the power to make Leela love me.
15092,ROBOT DEVIL,"Oh sorry, that'll wear off in a couple of days."
15093,FRY,Check it out everyone. I'm back from hell and I've got the Robot Devil's hands!
15094,AMY,Neat! Let's see a trick.
15095,FRY,Alrighty!
15096,SCRUFFY,Somebody called the Robot Devil's here to see somebody called Fry.
15097,FRY,Uh-oh.
15098,BENDER,Where'd I go just now?
15099,ROBOT DEVIL,Hello Fry.  Just dropped by to make sure you're as happy with our little deal as I am.  Give me back my hands! These things are always touching me in places.
15100,FRY,"Yeah, they get around! But I'm afraid we had a deal."
15101,ROBOT DEVIL,It looks like I wasted a bus trip.
15102,FRY,Yes you did.
15103,GRUMPY SNAIL [ON TV],"Yes, now you can hear holophonor virtuoso Philip Fry play 900 of his classic themes in your own home on this two-record set.  That's over 30 minutes of music for only $14.99."
15104,ZOIDBERG,"Only $14.99 for a two-record set. Two records! Oh Zoidberg, at last you're becoming a crafty consumer!  Hello? I'll take eight!"
15105,SCRUFFY,Mr Hedonismbot to see you.
15106,FRY,Show him in.
15107,SCRUFFY,Very good sir.
15108,HEDONISMBOT,"Ah Fry, congratulations. Your latest performance was as delectable as dipping my bottom over and over into a bath of the silkiest oils and creams!"
15109,FRY,"Thank you sir, that's exactly what I was going for."
15110,HEDONISMBOT,You were the sole diversion in what has been a pale and unamusing season. And so I would feign commission you write an opera.
15111,FRY,"But, I've never written an opera."
15112,HEDONISMBOT,"And I've never heard one. Still, if you can keep me amused through the overture I shall consider it a smashing success."
15113,FRY,But I wouldn't even know what to write about. Unless...  OK I'll do it. If I can make it about Leela.
15114,LEELA,Me? Really?
15115,HEDONISMBOT,"A man writing an opera about a woman? Oh sera, how deliciously absurd!  I shall see you at the premiere."
15116,LEELA,Is it part of the opera?
15117,FRY,Leela!  You shouldn't be listening. I-I don't want you to hear it 'til it's done.
15118,LEELA,But it's so beautiful.
15119,FRY,So's a peacock but you don't eat it 'til it's cooked. This has to be perfect. I want you to hear exactly what I hear when I think about you.
15120,LEELA,Oh Fry. All this time you've had this incredible gift and I never knew. I've been a fool. A fully justified prudent fool.  They're so cold.
15121,FRY,(shouting) No!
15122,ROBOT DEVIL,"Ah Bender, this is a surprise! For you. Finding me in the refrigerator."
15123,BENDER,True but at least I don't have the hiccups anymore. What up?
15124,ROBOT DEVIL,Oh well it so happens I'm in the mood to make a deal with you.
15125,BENDER,"Forget it, you can't tempt me."
15126,ROBOT DEVIL,(tempting) Really? There's nothing you want?
15127,BENDER,"Hm. I forgot you could tempt me with things I want.  Well, I suppose I've always wondered what it would be like to be more annoying."
15128,ROBOT DEVIL,Nothing simpler! And all I ask in return is you hands.  To replace these bony hotdogs!
15129,BENDER,Grabby and Squeezy? Never! I love these guys!
15130,ROBOT DEVIL,Is there anything else you would part with?
15131,BENDER,"No, nothing ain't gonna happen."
15132,BENDER,Yes! With this built-in stadium airhorn I can really annoy people. And all it cost me was my crotchplate.
15133,ROBOT DEVIL,You certainly are a shrewd businessman Bender.  Now find someone and give 'em a good blast!
15134,BENDER,"Yeah, that'll teach the first person I see a lesson!"
15135,ROBOT DEVIL,"Ah, my ridiculously circuitous plan is one-quarter complete!"
15136,LEELA,"Well, Fry's opera premiere's tomorrow night. I'm off to find a pair of formal gloves that'll fit over my enormous forearms."
15137,BENDER,"Pretty annoying, huh Leela?"
15138,LEELA,(shouting) What? Are you talking? Oh God I'm deaf!
15139,BENDER,Oops. I'm so so sorry Leela. I just wanted to annoy you.
15140,LEELA,(shouting) What? Oh this is horrible. I won't be able to hear Fry's opera.
15141,ROBOT DEVIL,Ah how delightfully ironic.
15142,BENDER,"It's not ironic, it's just mean. Take this!"
15143,ROBOT DEVIL,Ooh! Out of aerosol? Also ironic!
15144,BENDER,Oh yeah? Well bite my shiny metal - (shouting) Oh nooo!
15145,LEELA,"Nobody tell Fry I'm deaf. If he found out I couldn't hear his opera, it'd break his heart."
15146,BENDER,OK deafo.
15147,HEDONISMBOT,Courtesans and gentle fops. I bid you welcome to my opera.  Let us cavort like the Greeks of old. (sexfully) You know the ones I mean.
15148,LEELA,Yay Fry!
15149,ZOIDBERG,I watch TV with that guy!
15150,HOLO-VOGEL,(singing) Who is this one-eyed female baby Moses?
15151,HOLO-ORPHANS,"(singing) A saviour from the stars,"
15152,HOLO-LEELA,(singing) Or just some lonely filthy starving child.
15153,LEELA,"Amy, Fry's looking at me. What am s'posed to be feeling?  Ah!"
15154,HOLO-BENDER,(singing) Leela! Leela Leela save him!
15155,BENDER,I don't recall ever fighting Godzilla but that is so what I would have done.
15156,AMY,One diet double Martini please.
15157,BARTENDER,And for you sir?
15158,HERMES,I'll just have a Shirley Hemple.
15159,TINNY TIM,Extra! Extra! World's greatest opera only half over!
15160,LEELA,"Half over? Oh, I'd give anything to hear the rest."
15161,ROBOT DEVIL,"Anything?  Thank you sir.  Now, as I was saying, anything? Because I can give you new robotic ears!"
15162,LEELA,"What? You can give me new ears? Wait, what seemingly reasonable thing do you want in return?"
15163,ROBOT DEVIL,Just your hands my dear.
15164,LEELA,"Whatever you said, forget it!"
15165,ROBOT DEVIL,"Alright, just one hand."
15166,LEELA,Just...my left hand? Um...uh...
15167,ANNOUNCER,Please take your seats for act two.
15168,HEDONISMBOT,But I'm not done vomiting.
15169,LEELA,I can't stand it!  OK. You can have my hand.
15170,ROBOT DEVIL,"Wonderful!  Just sign here.  Calculon old friend, I'm afraid I need your ears."
15171,CALCULON,Well I do owe you for giving me this unholy (dramatically) acting talent!
15172,LEELA,"I can hear! I can hear like a safecracker! Hey, aren't you gonna take my hand?"
15173,ROBOT DEVIL,"In good time, you go enjoy the opera."
15174,HOLO-FRY,"(singing) To win Leela's heart with the holophonor's art,"
15175,HOLO-ROBOT DEVIL,"(singing) Well I don't see any danger,"
15176,ROBOT DEVIL,Stupider? Pah! This opera's as lousy as it is brilliant!  Your lyrics lack subtlety. You can't just have your characters announce how they feel. That makes me feel angry.
15177,FRY,"Look, what do you want?"
15178,ROBOT DEVIL,(singing) I want my hands back.
15179,FRY,Never!
15180,ROBOT DEVIL,"(singing) Very well,"
15181,LEELA,Whoa!
15182,ROBOT DEVIL,(singing) Leela has promised me her hand.
15183,LEELA,"(singing) Fry, you do not understand."
15184,ROBOT DEVIL,(singing) ...In marriage!
15185,LEELA,What?
15186,ROBOT DEVIL,(singing) You'd give me your hand in marriage.
15187,HERMES,(singing) Is this really happening or just being staged?
15188,FARNSWORTH,(singing) It can't be real -
15189,AMY,(singing) Not if Leela is engaged!
15190,LEELA,"(singing) That isn't what I meant,"
15191,ROBOT DEVIL,(singing) You should have checked the wording in the fine...  Print!
15192,LEELA,(reading) I'll give you my hand...
15193,BENDER,"(singing) The use of words expressing something other than their literal intention,"
15194,ROBOT DEVIL,"(singing) I will marry her now and confine her to hell,"
15195,FRY,"(singing) Destiny has cheated me by forcing me to decide upon,"
15196,NIXON,Arooo!
15197,ZAPP,Bray-vo! Enn-core!
15198,FARNSWORTH,(singing) I can't believe the devil is so unforgiving.
15199,ZOIDBERG,(singing) I can't believe everyone is just ad-libbing!
15200,PREACHERBOT,"(singing) By the power vested in me,"
15201,FRY,No!  Stop! Take my hands!
15202,HEDONISMBOT,Surgery in an opera? How wonderfully decadent and just as I was beginning to lose interest.  The chocolate icing! Oh my!
15203,FRY,My hands. My horrible human hands. And what did you do to my nails?
15204,ROBOT DEVIL,I cleaned them. Now if you'll excuse me it's my poker night and I feel lucky. So it's back to hell for me. Come on Nixon!
15205,NIXON,Huh?
15206,HEDONISMBOT,"Less reality, more fantasy. Resume the opera."
15207,FRY,But I can't play anymore.
15208,ZOIDBERG,"(shouting) Yes you can. The beauty was in your heart, not your hands.  The music's bad and you should feel bad."
15209,FRY,"Ah! Ooo, ah, whoa, hey!"
15210,TINNY TIM,(shouting) Extra! Extra! Greatest opera of all time sucks!
15211,ZOIDBERG,I'll take eight!
15212,LEELA,Please don't stop playing Fry. I wanna hear how it ends.
