And a direct-to-DVD movie coming out soon.<hr/><b>Chris</b>   <img src=\"/images/rating/10-stars.gif\"/> (10 out of 10 )<br/><br/>Yeah, this is probably the greatest pilot episode ever written in TV history.  We get to meet each of the main characters of the series one at a time, and each of them demonstrate their cheif character traits as we meet them.  The inciting incident is IMMENSE and conflict quickly inssues, followed by a multitude of obstacles for our guy to overcome in order to get what he wants.  Not only is it perfectly structered and mapped out in the exact way a plilot needs to be, but it's obserdly hilarious as well.  When the knife pops out of the suicide both and slowly twists as if in a mans heart and the robot voice says, \"Thank you for using, stop and drop.  America's #1 suicide both since 2080\", lol, gets me every time.   btw, baby, needs more romance!!???  It's an animated comedy!  <hr/></td>\n",
