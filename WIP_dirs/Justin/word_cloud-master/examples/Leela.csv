30,As long as it's not about my eye.
32,Is it about my eye?
34,Just ask the question.
36,"I'm an alien, alright? Now let's drop the subject."
38,"No, I just work here."
40,Yep. It's December 31st 2999.
42,I'm sure this must be very upsetting for you.
44,"Well, at least here you'll be treated with dignity. Now strip naked and get on the probulator."
45,Interesting. Your DNA test shows one living relative. He's your great great great great great great great...
46,...great great great great great nephew.
48,Professor Hubert Farnsworth.
51,Your permanent career assignment.
53,Take your hands off me! You've been assigned the job you're best at just like everyone else.
55,Then you'll be fired...
57,...out of a cannon into the Sun!
59,"Well that's tough! Lots of people don't like their jobs but we do them anyway. You gotta do what you gotta do! Now hold out your hand, I'm gonna implant your career chip. It'll permanently label you as a delivery boy."
61,"Hold still, damnit. I don't have good depth perception!  You've got until the count of five to let me out of here. One..."
80,"...two, three -- Hey!"
82,"Shut up, Terry."
84,"Look, he's just a nobody who doesn't want to be a delivery boy. I'd really rather not force it on him."
100,This is officer 1B-DI requesting back-up.
110,Hmm.
111,"I'm sorry, Fry, but I have to install your career chip."
113,It's my job. You gotta do what you gotta do!
114,Watch it!
119,"Please, officers, there's no need to use force."
121,"Oh, come on, he's just a poor kid from the Stupid Ages."
123,No-one makes fun of my nose.
125,You guys were totally out of control.
133,Open up!
141,Wait!
152,"Look, I know it's not much consolation but I understand how you feel."
156,I understand. I'm the only one-eyed alien on this whole planet. My parents abandoned me here as a baby and I don't even know what galaxy they were from. I know how it feels to be alone.
158,Quitting.
160,Because I've always wanted to. I just never realised it before I met you.
163,"Hey, he stole my ring!"
165,I don't wanna spoil the party but we're all job deserters now. We're unemployed and we have nowhere to go.
182,Can't we get away in the ship?
186,I can. As long as I don't have to parallel park.
188,Prepare for lift-off. Ten.
197,One!
206,"Thanks for the offer, Professor, but we don't have the proper career chips."
229,"Well, if you don't like that try some Archduke Chocula."
235,(reading) Death by airlock failure.
237,(reading) Death by brain parasite.
239,(reading) Death by sonic diarrhoea?
241,"Look, I don't know about any of your previous captains but I intend to do as little dying as possible."
257,Ow!
263,Hang on. Amy Wong? Of the Mars Wongs?
265,Uh-huh! What sorority do you belong to?
272,Nowhere special. The moon.
275,Well...I guess so. Just be careful. I'd like to hold off any major screwups until at least my second day as captain.
278,"Huh? Oh sure, knock yourself out."
280,OK we're here!
282,"Relax, its open till 9."
290,"Fry, we have a crate to deliver."
293,"OK, if everyone's finished being stupid --"
295,We'll deliver that crate like professionals and then we'll go home.
297,"Alright. We'll deliver that crate like professionals...and then we'll go ride the bumper cars.  Amy, why don't you help Fry hoist down the crate. Then lock up when you're done. Just be careful."
312,Who buys this trash?
326,"What's wrong, Fry?"
328,But the phoney stuff is what's fun. It's boring out there.
330,Maybe I should take Fry on the Luna Rover ride. You get to wear a space suit and drive around on the surface. And the line's short because it's educational.
336,"Wow, I never realised the first astronauts were so fat!"
349,(singing) ...and sing a whaling tune. We're whalers on the moon...
351,"Oh, really? I don't see you with a fungineering degree! p>"
353,"Fry, no. This is my first mission and I'm not gonna let us get in any trouble. Besides, the car's on a track."
356,"OK, you're on the surface. Now I'll give you 10 minutes. Then you'll get bored, turn around and apologise for being such a jerk. Agreed?"
360,Time's up. Make a U-turn at the next crater.
362,That's crazy! It's been lost for centuries!
365,No. Now we're gonna die.
374,Thank God!
378,Our car broke down and we're out of oxygen. Can we borrow some?
381,"Fry, night lasts two weeks on the moon."
393,"I told you to turn around and go back to the park. But oh, no, the park was too phoney. We had to see the real moon."
395,"Fry, face it. The moon is a dump. It's a boring dried up wasteland. And the only reason anybody ever comes here is for the tacky little amusement park. Can't you just accept that?"
399,Bender?
405,Hang on. Hang on. Jump.  Hold on to your helmet!
409,"Nightfall's coming.  Hurry, before we freeze."
412,We can't outrun it forever.
414,"Quick, get in."
416,"Fry, look around. It's just a crummy plastic flag and a dead man's tracks in the dust.  Now get in here before you freeze."
418,Well if the oxygen holds out we might live long enough to starve to death.
420,"That's right, you shouldn't have. I still don't get what the big attraction is."
422,A week would be a little much.
424,"Fry, look. It really is beautiful. I don't know why I never noticed before."
427,Amy? Where'd she learn to operate the controls like that?
432,"So, Fry, was the real moon anything like the moon you used to dream about?"
443,What the hell are you doing?! You're getting a huge dose of radiation!
445,Do you know how long it's going to take me to recalibrate these engines?
447,"Professor, We need to talk to you about Fry."
449,He's a nice guy but we think it's about time he got his own place.
463,We've all talked it over and --
465,"Fry, sometimes in close quarters, people do inconsiderate things without realising it."
467,"No, Fry, by ""close quarters"" I mean this office..."
469,"...and by ""people"" I mean you!"
471,"And by ""inconsiderate"" I mean --"
512,We sure are cheerful this morning.
514,What happened to you?
516,Look at yourself. You're a wreck! You've got to find a new place to live.
518,"Love your optimism, Fry. But seriously, you've got to tell Bender you're moving out."
525,What if I just helped the two of you find a bigger apartment?
528,At least it's got a great view.
531,Wow! Now this is fantastic!
537,Was his apartment rent-controlled?
538,"Wow, this is beautiful."
540,It's not crap.
550,"Happy housewarming, Fry!  It's a miniature fruit salad tree."
587,You had cable. This is satellite.
618,"Fry, you're Bender's best friend. How could you let that mob kick him out?"
620,Only when he's in them and you know it. You really hurt his feelings.
622,"Bender's not a guy, he's a robot."
626,"Bender?  My God, you're a mess!"
628,"Look at that five o'clock rust. You've been up all night not drinking, haven't you?"
630,"Please, Bender. Have some malt liquor. If not for yourself then for the people who love you."
632,"Oh, now look. It's obvious you miss being Fry's roommate. But there's got to be a better way to deal with this."
634,"Well, if that would work."
636,Wait! I want you to look me in the eye and promise you won't get behind the wheel without some kind of alcoholic beverage in your hand.
639,I can't just stand by and be silent about Bender anymore.
641,Well I can't just do that anymore. Your best friend is out there somewhere destroying himself.
643,"He doesn't care about the apartment, he cares about you. And you turned your back on him."
649,Bender! Stop!
653,"Fry, don't help him mutilate himself."
661,You guys could learn a lesson from those two.
665,"Wait a minute! You did it all backwards. Fry's the one who should be......Oh, never mind!"
681,This place was a great choice. The food is amazing. And such generous portions.
683,"You know, Doug, most guys are put off by my eye. It's nice to finally meet someone who's open-minded.  Ew!"
685,I don't know. Something I couldn’t quite put my finger on. Possibly his vile lizard tongue.
688,There's nothing wrong with having high standards. Now can we please stop --
691,"Thank you all for the inspiring advice, but I'm perfectly happy with my life the way it is."
707,I don't know. Maybe?
709,What?! How can you tell?
711,There's no such thing.
724,That's great - really - but he's just not what I'm looking for.
732,Could you guys please stop talking about my personal life?
740,Animals?
742,Wait! What about the animals?
744,"Yes, but what about the animals?"
746,The animals.
748,So we have to bring back two of each kind. Just like Noah's Ark.
753,Do you mind?
755,"Thank you. But I don't care how many eyes a man has - as long as it's less than five. All I'm looking for is a guy who's adventurous, self-confident..."
756,...maybe a snappy dresser.
763,"Hey, look! That's Zapp Brannigan's ship."
765,Uh-huh!
769,They say Zapp Brannigan single-handedly saved the Octillian system from a horde of rampaging Killbots.
772,He's the most decorated captain in the whole Democratic Order Of Planets.
774,No I don't. But I think we ought to meet with him and see if he'll help us rescue those animals.
780,"Hello, I'm Leela, captain of the Planet Express delivery ship. We've come aboard to plead for your assistance."
783,"Oh, not at all. I'm just so uh...really thrilled to meet you!"
785,(flattered) You don't mean that!
792,"Captain Brannigan, we really need to talk to you about our mission."
795,We're hoping to save the animals of Vergon 6 from extinction. And if you could just --
797,Wait! What's wrong?
799,But people already interfered. That planet was mined completely hollow.
801,This doesn't make any sense.
803,Fine! We'll save the animals without your help.
808,Ow! I might've liked Zapp Brannigan if he weren't a pompous dimwit who threw me in prison.
824,"Good. This will be my chance to reason with him, captain to captain."
828,I didn't realise you were such a coin-a-sewer.
830,Captain...
832,...if we could speak seriously for a moment...
834,...I'd like you to reconsider letting us rescue those animals.
836,What?
842,I'm not really in the mood.
844,Can I please just go back to prison?
846,Much rather!  What are you doing?
848,"No, and it's pronounced ""sham-pane""."
850,Its not a big deal.
852,"Oh, forget it."
854,It comes with the job.
856,"Oh, come on, cheer up, it's not that bad."
861,"Uh, listen, Zapp."
863,"Zapp, last night was a mistake."
865,"No, just a regular mistake. For a split second my common sense was overwhelmed by pity."
867,The only kind of crawling I'm doing to you is away - from!
869,"Look, I'm going down to Vergon 6 to save those animals whether you like it or not."
871,"Threaten all you -- wait, what?"
873,Eurgh!
881,(defensively) Nothing.
883,"(defensively) We just talked, OK?!"
884,Alright. We don't have much time to collect these animals. The planet is supposed to collapse in approximately two hours ago.
885,"Hello there.  Hmm, he doesn't seem to be on the checklist."
888,"No! I don't care how hilarious your apron is, we're not cooking him.  Aww, I'll call him Nibbler."
890,I hope he'll be OK in there with all those big animals.
895,Good. That's the last species.
898,Nibbler!
901,"Leave him alone. It's not his fault that he's an unstoppable killing machine. Is it, snoogums?"
903,"Prepare for lift-off.  We're out of fuel. Bender, I told you to fill the tank before we left."
906,"No way, forget it! I refuse to go crawling back to him!"
908,(defensively) Nothing. We just talked.
911,That's enough. Don't you think I feel bad enough already?
913,"Alright, alright I'll call him.  I mean if living is that important to you."
915,"Hello, Zapp?"
917,"Zapp, we're out of fuel..."
918,...and Vergon 6 is about to implode. We need your help.
920,Bird's don't crawl.
922,"Look, are you going to rescue us or not?"
924,(sexfully) Please...
925,...Big Z?
928,"I would never abandon a helpless animal. Y'know, Zapp, once I thought you were a big pompous buffoon. Then I realised that inside you were just a pitiful child. But now I realise that outside that child is a big pompous buffoon!"
931,"Uh, I guess to sit here and wait for death."
935,I don't believe it! It's dark matter.
937,"His species must've filled the entire planet with it. Did you do that, you cute little --  Come on. That should be more than enough fuel to get us outta here. Bender, pick it up and put it in the engine."
938,We made it!  And some of the animals survived.
941,(thinking) Dear Captain's Diary. I may not have found love on this mission but I did find a cute little companion who excretes starship fuel. And that's just as good.
948,"What do you think of the view, Fry?"
953,"Face it, Fry. Baseball was as boring as mom and apple pie. That's why they jazzed it up."
958,It's traditional. Just like aluminium bats and the seventh inning grope.
972,"Except for the word ""blern"" that was complete gibberish."
974,Alright! Yes! Miller's on a pace to hit 70 blerns!
977,"Exactly! He was a machine designed to hit blerns! I mean, come on, Wireless Joe was nothing but a programmable bat on wheels."
979,Yep.
998,"Hey, hold on. I understand these robots hate humans, but how do they feel about humanoid aliens?"
1002,This is the first actual work you've ever had to do around here.
1006,"Oh, come on, Bender. Last month it was Robomadom and before that Robonza."
1015,"OK, Bender, we're here. It's time to get to work."
1017,"Now we can't land on the surface because those robots will kill Fry and me. So we'll have to stay up here and lower you with the winch. And remember: You don't know humans, you don't work for humans, and, above all, you don't like humans."
1019,"Hmm, he seems pretty angry."
1021,Maybe we ought to do something nice for him.
1022,There! This oughta show that stupid robot we care about him.
1026,"No, we can't! They'll kill us on sight."
1028,I don't know! I don't know! It's not an easy decision. If only I had two or three minutes to think about it.
1029,"OK. If we're going to save Bender, we've got to look and act exactly like robots."
1031,"We'll have to walk like robots, talk like robots and, if necessary, solve complex differential equations like robots."
1033,"Fry, first of all this is serious. And second of all:"
1035,"Yeah, but there wasn't a Woolworth's in this quadrant."
1038,Robot...we be.
1045,Then we'll go with that data file.
1049,"Now if you see any robots, just stay out of their way.  (shouting) So far, so good."
1051,Have you seen this robot?
1053,"Come on, Fry, walk like a robot."
1055,Robots don't have bathrooms.
1057,Listen. Just go behind those garbage cans. I'll stand guard.
1058,"Hurry up, Fry!"
1064,I'm sorry. My friend and I have to go and perform some mindless repetitive tasks.
1069,Quick! Let's duck in here!
1076,Mine's not working.
1081,OK. Keep an eye out for Bender.
1085,What's that?
1087,Try to stay with the crowd so no one notices how crummy you look.
1116,Good for you. Now let's all get back to the ship.
1135,Yeah! I mean he might not have a case but I'm genuinely not a human.
1146,Look! One eye! Count them: One! Not human!
1149,Are you alright?
1151,Who are you?
1155,What's going on here?
1182,He'll do it. He's crazy!
1194,Of course.
1209,Of course.
1213,Didn't you have ads in the 20th century?
1250,"I'd love to chip in, but Bender stole my wallet."
1261,"I know Fry's rich, but do we really have to wear these top hats?"
1278,"I know you spent a lot of money on this place, Fry, but it's awfully primitive. The floors are made of such hard wood."
1283,That's cute!
1286,"I just don't get it. Who was this Ted Danson? And why would you pay $10,000 for his skeleton?"
1289,You're just saying that because he bought you that antique robot toy.
1298,Are you crazy? It's a can of old fish.
1302,"Oh, my God, it's Mom! I've never seen her in person before."
1304,"Fry, you can't bid against Mom. She's the richest, most powerful person in the world. And she's so adorable."
1323,Fry? Are you there?
1325,You haven't been to work in three days. What have you been doing?
1327,You can't just sit here in the dark listening to classical music.
1329,"Fry, this isn't healthy. You're living in the past."
1331,But we're your friends and we live here in the year 3000.
1336,Fry please.   My ponytail's caught in the door.
1405,Since when do you care about us?
1408,Goodbye-eee!
1416,You're Fry's relative. Do you have any idea how he got so crazy?
1419,You did? What happened?
1423,It's Mom.
1444,Is that a cooking show?
1446,Bender! I didn't know you liked cooking! That's so cute!
1457,"I know you like cooking shows but you're a robot, you don't even have a sense of taste."
1462,Among other things.
1470,"Fry, you have to be more careful. We're not in the 20th century. You don't know how things work here."
1475,What's this spice for?
1476,Oh! That's ridiculous. (whispering) I'll take two pounds!
1480,"Hey, have you seen Fry?"
1488,What the hell were you doing? I warned you to stay away from those guys.
1496,"Uh, Professor, are we even allowed in the Forbidden Zone?"
1498,"Uh, Professor..."
1503,"(whispering) Listen, this is Bender's first meal and he's a little sensitive. So let's be supportive, OK?"
1506,"(shouting) Oh, dear God!"
1513,"OK, Fry, here's the package to deliver and for once in your life be careful. This is my first visit to the Galaxy Of Terror and I'd like it to be a pleasant one."
1515,"Don't touch anything or talk to anyone. Just go to the palace, drop it off and come right back."
1527,"So after I specifically asked you not to touch anything, you drank a bottle of strange blue liquid? It could have been poisonous acid!"
1536,"That's it, Fry. As your captain I order you back to the ship. You are in way over your head."
1546,"Does anyone else think it's odd that a shiftless 25-year-old delivery boy could drop out of the sky, kill the emperor and be rewarded instead of punished?"
1563,"(whispering) Fry, I have to talk to you. You're in terrible danger."
1564,"You see Emperor Plon here?  He met his end when he was drunk by Emperor Strug. And before he could even wipe his mouth, Strug was drunk by Shwab."
1566,Look at all these guys. Do you have any idea what the average length of their reigns was?
1568,No. One week.
1570,Every Emperor ascended to power by assassinating the previous one. And guess who's next?
1572,"You're in tremendous danger, you idiot! Half of these Emperors were drunk at their own coronation."
1574,"No, they were assassinated. In fact, the law says you'll be killed on the spot if you fail to recite the oath from memory."
1576,That is completely reckless. Don't you ever think ahead?
1578,I give up! You're gonna get yourself killed and this time I won't be here to save you.
1580,"That's it! I'm never helping you again! If anyone except you needs me, I'll be in the ship."
1628,I'll accept.
1631,I like you.
1633,I don't know why I should. I mean after what he --
1653,What are you talking about?
1655,Of course I'm alive.
1660,"Listen, Fry, I think I can get us out of this if you're willing to let me help you."
1662,"I know. Amy, get the bottle."
1664,Come on. Everybody help out Fry.
1666,"How we doing, Amy?"
1682,Does it really work?
1715,"Uh, Professor...?"
1734,I don't get it.
1741,I think it's moving.
1752,"Fry, what the hell were you people thinking back then? How could you just throw your garbage away?"
1754,We recycle everything. Robots are made from old beer cans.
1756,And that sandwich you're eating is made of old discarded sandwiches.  Nothing just gets thrown away.
1758,Typical 20th century attitude.
1760,Those things are all from the 19th century.
1782,Can't we just shoot a missile at it?
1791,That's all? But --
1793,Odour at magnitude 8.  Magnitude 12. Magnitude 31.  We're breaking up. Turn on the anti-smell device.
1796,Look at all this filth.
1800,"Fry, this stuff was garbage when it was new. Let's blow it up already!"
1803,"Let's see. If that's Hypodermic Ridge then the bomb must go right here.  Get ready to run. We've got 25 minutes. Uh, 15 minutes.  5 minutes.  6h minutes?"
1805,"That idiot! It wasn't set for 25 minutes, it was set for 52 seconds."
1809,"Hey, watch it! You'll put somebody's eye out!"
1812,"Yeah, but this garbage ball's unstoppable now. New New York is done for."
1828,That rat! Do something!
1832,But where can we find a substance the exact density and consistency as garbage?
1849,Just fire the damn thing.
1857,"Should we really be celebrating? I mean, what if the second garbage ball returns to Earth like the first one did?"
1868,Impressive. They're busting mad rhymes with an 80% success rate.
1874,"Ow! Hey, watch it!"
1911,If I didn't know better I'd almost think he was abusing electricity.
1913,"Bender, why are you spending so much time in the bathroom? Are you jacking on in there?"
1918,Did he use his tongue?
1921,Uh oh. There seems to be some sort of electrical disturbance in the Coalsack Nebula.
1923,Electrical. Anyway it's going to take some careful piloting to avoid it.
1924,We're out of control. We're heading straight into the electric field!
1928,"Bender, we didn't mind your drinking, or your kleptomania, or your pornography ring."
1930,But this electricity abuse crossed the line. You almost killed us.
1947,"Give him a break, Fry. If this helps Bender clean up his act then I think we should be supportive."
1960,This is unbelievable. The old Bender never would have taken us out to dinner.
1971,What are you doing to my ship?
1974,Amen.
1977,"And I think I know a way to do it. We have to reacquaint him with a little thing called ""sleaze""."
1981,"Uh, here."
1984,"Hey, great idea!"
1988,"Hey, Bender, looks at that woman's purse. It's hanging by a spaghetti strand."
1994,Go nuts.
2004,What in hell happened to Bender?
2013,Hmm. Look! It's the symbol of Bender's old religion.
2015,Who would've thought hell would really exist? And that it would be in New Jersey!
2032,(singing) It's up to us to rescue him.
2034,(singing) It's us who tempted him to sin.
2036,"(singing) Come on, Fry, don't be scared,"
2041,"Alright, Beelzebot, what'll it take to get our friend back?"
2043,Wait. What fiddle contest?
2047,(whispering) Do you know how to play the fiddle?
2049,"(whispering) No, but I used to play the drums. They're sorta similar. (talking) What happens if we lose?"
2051,We'll do it.
2055,Time for the drum solo!
2058,"Hurry, Bender!"
2060,"Oh, sorry."
2062,"Uh, do you think you could be just little less evil than that."
2069,That was the worst delivery ever.
2075,Vacation?
2081,Looks nice.
2084,"Oh, God! Not Zapp Brannigan!"
2086,"Let's just say we've ""crossed paths""."
2090,"It's tempting, but, uh, I have a fiancé now. Uh, hmm, uh, hmm, uh, we--, uh ...  Him! Fry, darling, meet Zapp Brannigan."
2098,This is it.
2103,Take it off or I'll break it off.
2137,"Well, our accommodations aren't great but it sure is beautiful our here."
2139,"Fry, just be quiet. I'm beginning to think this whole fake fiancé thing was a terrible, terrible--"
2142,"Uh, look, before you get any crazy ideas, that was for Zapp."
2144,"Alright, can we try not to complicate this?"
2148,It would have been nice if you'd told me you were going out with Amy.
2150,What? No. No! Of course not!
2186,But I didn't even limbo.
2196,Amy!
2199,(whispering) What are we gonna do? Fry can't pretend to be both our boyfriends.
2219,I didn't run off. I had plenty of time to finish eating and stroll away while you were kissing Amy.
2221,"Oh, are you sure? I mean, she has two eyes, you have two eyes."
2223,Nice nebula.
2225,Look's like everybody's got somebody. Except me.
2227,"What was that?  Oh, my God! We're heading straight into a black hole."
2232,OK. We just have to get from here to the escape pods.
2234,"Come on, before its too late!"
2247,Hurry! The escape pods should be just ahead!
2249,It won't move. And the door release is on the other side.
2265,We can't leave yet. We've got to wait for Bender. The high gravity must be slowing down his looting.
2275,I don't know. But we can't wait any longer.
2278,Something's wrong. We're two metric tons overweight.
2288,"But she saved all our lives. Without her, we're light enough to get away."
2300,In what field?
2306,"They planted traditional college foliage: ivy, trees, hemp. Soon the whole planet was terraformed."
2311,You went to college?
2335,"Don't take this the wrong way, Fry, but you don't seem like the educated type."
2337,Please! Everyone knows 20th century colleges were basically expensive daycare centres.
2340,You won't last two weeks.
2358,I think that's probably your roommate.
2367,So what makes Guenter talk?
2430,"What you did to Guenter was cruel. At the risk of sounding like an after-school special, I think we learned who the real animal was today."
2434,"Hey, what's going on? I thought you didn't like bananas."
2437,"Besides, Guenter, you're not like other monkeys. You've got the hat."
2439,That's so sad. I didn't even know monkeys could cry.
2443,But he's not your father. That guy in the punch bowl was your father.
2451,So he just ran away in the middle of the exam?
2457,"Nuh-uh, I'm staying out of this. Now here's my opinion: What we should do is..."
2459,I said we'll go to the jungle and let Guenter decide once and for all.
2470,I see some movement up there. I think it's him.
2472,Oops.
2475,"Professor, you'll offer Guenter the hat and, Fry, you'll offer him the banana. We'll let him choose whether he wants to be intelligent or just a mindless animal."
2480,"Wait, what's that sound?"
2485,No! No!
2488,Not there.
2491,"(shouting) Help us, Guenter!"
2495,"Oh, no! Hurry, Guenter, climb up the vine. You can still save yourself."
2530,Who's up for one last summer beach trip?
2534,"Fry, you're wasting your life sitting in front of that TV. You need to get out and see the real world."
2536,Everyone's too polite to say anything but you're covered with bed sores.
2538,Just get in the car.
2541,"They are now. In the 2600's New Yorkers elected a super-villain governor, and he stole most of the world's monuments."
2556,No. I'm not attracted to bullies. No matter how big and ...  ... handsome they are.
2560,Fry! Although I suppose we could go for a walk along the beach.
2565,It's very nice. We should get a picture before the tide comes in.
2569,"Oh, my God!"
2581,The Earth is under attack. Can't we just forget about that?
2584,"Well, you heard the windbag: We've been drafted. Everyone into the ship."
2595,"Thanks, but I'm not technically human."
2604,"Maybe we should wait 'til afterwards, in case neither of us comes back."
2607,"Fry, this isn't TV, it's real life. Can't you tell the difference?"
2609,"Bender, damage report."
2612,We did it! We won!
2620,"This is hopeless.  If we're gonna get blown to bits, we might as well do it in the comfort of our own home."
2641,"You do not, you big fat liar. You don't know anyone. All you do is watch TV."
2646,They're going to destroy the entire Earth if they don't see some stupid TV show about some bimbo lawyer?
2661,"Uh-uh, forget it. A: I'm camera shy, and B: I get tongue tied in front of an audience armed with death rays."
2663,Gimme the script.
2670,"Your Honour, I move for a mistrial, on the grounds that I'm also having a hot, naked affair with the foreman of this jury."
2676,Sleeping with you.
2678,"Uh, g-- uh, getting back to the, uh, matter, uh-uh, if it please the court ... (whispering) Fry, there's nothing else here. You only wrote two pages of dialogue."
2680,What are we supposed to do now?
2682,Uh...
2684,"I say ... I'm giving up the law.  And I'm giving up being single. Your Honour, will you marry me?"
2688,"Why not? It's clever, it's unexpected."
2697,(reading) I will now make my closing statement. With my fiancé deceased ... ... I hereby return to my single female lawyer career. No matter what any man says.
2725,I've never seen anyone so addicted to Slurm.
2727,"Bender, what's wrong?"
2729,You poor baby. Let me check if you have a fever.  Ow!
2743,"Hey, what's rattling around in there?"
2764,"Fry, are you alright?"
2767,"Ooh, look at that!"
2798,"Hey, look! The disgusting little men are starting to sing."
2816,"Hey, what's behind that door?"
2818,Is it the secret ingredient?
2821,I was just curious because of the armed guards.
2826,What are you doing?
2828,No. That's moronic.
2830,"Bender, why did you jump in?"
2833,Where are we?
2836,Something's rotten on the planet Wormulon. Look at this.
2837,This all must have something to do with the secret ingredient.
2839,No. There's already a soda like that: Soylent Cola.
2841,It varies from person to person.
2847,(whispering) Quick.
2849,It's the end of the line. This must be where they put in the secret ingredient.
2852,Blech!
2854,Fry!  Fry!
2856,That's the only ingredient of Slurm.
2860,The exit! We made it.
2863,"You wish, you slimy worm! Heyya!"
2867,How can you trick people into drinking something that comes out of your behind? It's disgusting.
2884,"Fry, untie us, quick!"
2886,You pig. Stop stuffing your craw and save us.
2888,"Yeah, we're boned."
2890,Hurry!
2893,We're close to the exit. I can smell those filthy orange guys.
2903,She's gaining on us.
2922,For Slurms!
2933,Aww! Somebody likes snouts.
2938,"Don't yell at Nibbler like that.  You hurt his feelings. Come on, pet him and make up."
2940,I said pet him.
2942,Are you alright?
2944,"Not you.  Aww, poor baby chipped a fang."
2952,No!
2954,Next time I'm keeping it.
2961,"Aww, look how cuddly he looks in his new cape!"
2970,"Come on, let's all sing Happy Birthday!"
2974,"Bender, I thought you were supposed to be cooking for this party."
2976,"Just make a simple cake. And this time, if someone's going to jump out of it, make sure you put them in after you cook it."
2981,"Bender, what's going--  (crying) No!"
2985,(crying) Aren't you upset at all? How would you feel if I flushed Fry down the toilet?
2987,(crying) You have no sympathy for anyone else's feelings.
2989,You do?
2992,(crying) I wouldn't feel so bad if Bender just understood the pain he caused me.
2997,I wish just once Bender could feel exactly what I feel.
3022,"Thank you, Professor. I'm happy that Bender can finally feel my pain."
3024,I'm not mopey. You shut up!
3026,"Thanks for taking me out, Amy. I feel slightly less miserable already."
3028,A puppy? Nibbler loved to eat puppies.
3038,(theatrical happiness) Sure. I'm having a great time -- really. You two go enjoy yourselves.
3049,Now he's flushed himself down the toilet? Who's he gonna flush next?
3051,You're right. I feel terrible.
3053,I guess we'd better go down into the sewers and look for him.
3056,There's no such thing as mutants. That's a ridiculous urban myth.
3061,What is it?
3063,"OK, check the guidebook."
3065,"Wait, what's that?"
3067,"Bender, you didn't have to come down here."
3069,(crying) He was so cute.
3072,(shouting) Nibbler?
3074,"It's no use. We'd better turn back. Which way, Fry?"
3076,(simultaneously) Idiot.
3079,(shouting) Mutants!
3080,Mutants! They're real!
3093,"No, we're on the top."
3097,"Listen. We actually came down here to find our pet, Nibbler. He got flushed down the toilet."
3103,(shouting) Nibbler?
3113,El Chupanibre? What's that?
3117,Wait. Our pet Nibbler loves fresh crocodile. It's his favourite treat. He must be El Chupanibre.
3120,You don't understand. He would never hurt people. Let us help you capture him.
3123,I volunteer.
3128,Nightfall? How can you tell down here?
3136,"Bender, do something."
3139,I can't. I love every living creature.
3141,As a friend.
3144,"Well, I could use a new tank top."
3146,A fashionable tank top. And designer boots ... encrusted with jewels.
3148,Yeah. And I could afford it all if I didn't have to feed that stupid Nibbler.
3151,You know what else I could use? A weekend at one of those fancy spas. And a Toblerone.
3153,You did it!
3158,"And it's all thanks to Bender. I love you, Bender."
3164,"You know, Bender may not have learned anything from me, but I think I actually learned something from him.  (shouting) So long, jerkwads!"
3174,What's the mission?
3182,What are we delivering?
3184,We'll get them there as quickly as we can.
3195,"If you don't mind, we're here to deliver the scissors for the ribbon-cutting."
3197,What for?
3199,But they're not even sharp. Who could I possibly hurt with them?
3201,What?
3227,"Dismiss all charges? Your Honour, I know the case is closed and you've rendered your verdict, but I wanna testify."
3230,"That's a stupid question. What matters is Zapp Brannigan is the sorriest captain I've ever seen, and I saw the idiot blow up DOOP headquarters with my own eye."
3234,(reluctantly) Yes.
3236,(reluctantly) Yes.
3238,Zapp Brannigan.
3251,"Alright, this is the third hose fight I've broken up today and the second one using actual hoses. Now move your lazy asses and start scrubbing the ship like I ordered you to."
3254,Zapp?
3256,I never loved you.
3258,What do you want?
3260,You don't know how to do any of those things.
3279,"Thanks, Kif. Very nice work."
3281,"I said ""very nice work""."
3283,"OK, crew, listen up. Your job is to delivery these 40 pillows to that hotel."
3285,They're not heavy in here because we have an anti-grav pump. But once you get out on the surface the gravity will be very intense.
3287,I don't want any screw-ups. Use the hover-dolly and just deliver one pillow at a time.
3293,What the hell happened?
3295,I told you dumb apes not to overload it. Each of those pillows weighs 150lbs here.
3298,"No way, Jack. You disobeyed an order, so now you have to deliver all 40 pillows by hand."
3300,Just get to work.
3304,"Y'know, why don't we talk about something besides Zapp for a while?"
3319,"On what grounds, you slobbering oaf?"
3323,You really don't want me to be captain anymore?
3325,"But, didn't I do a good job?"
3327,"Sometimes a captain needs to do those things. Besides I, I thought we were friends."
3359,Let me guess. He cancelled naptime? He ran out of beer?  So he's about to kill us?
3363,"Oh, no! He's disabled the steering. We're gonna crash!"
3365,"OK, OK. We have one chance. Are you willing to do what I say as captain?"
3367,Even if I make you work hard?
3369,Then go get the hover-dolly you didn't break and load all the dark matter into the left engine.
3372,Just do it.
3374,Hurry! I don't wanna die at the age of 25.
3378,You did it! You actually did it!
3382,"Well, actually--"
3384,"Your Honour, it's all true: My female incompetence, Zapp's cat-like reflexes, the stuff that made no sense, all of it."
3391,No.
3394,"Oh, alright."
3397,Let's mutiny!
3403,"There's a political debate on! Quick, change the channel!"
3406,"Look, I know there are no car chases but this is important. One of these two men will become president of the world."
3408,The United States is part of the world.
3413,Don't let their identical DNA fool you. They differ on some key issues.
3417,You're not registered?
3419,That's not true. The first robot president won by exactly one vote.
3422,"The point is, one vote can make a difference and even though it won't, I'm still taking you to get registered."
3464,What are you talking about?
3474,Bender? What happened to you?
3520,"Fry, he opened up relations with China. He doesn't want to hear about your ding-dong."
3543,"Bender, he's got your body!"
3545,Nixon must have bought your body from the pawn shop.
3549,"Ordinarily I'd say no and lecture you on how this is your own fault for being such an idiot. But when a robotic Nixon is on the loose, we have a duty to take action. Idiot."
3555,Come on. We've gotta find some way to talk to him.
3572,I've got a better plan.
3574,(whispering) They give you a discount if you've been here before.
3583,"OK, almost got it. Steady. Steady. Don't panic."
3588,"Alright, break it up, you two!"
3590,You'll never pardon anybody because you'll never get elected president. The voters of Earth aren't the pea-brained idiots they were back in your time.
3598,"The jig's up, Nixon. We'll trade you the tape for the body."
3604,Yes! The system works!
3606,No!
3615,"Oh, crud. I knew there was something I meant to do today."
3632,Great idea!
3635,Actually it did. But thank God nuclear winter cancelled it out.
3642,"Yeah, yeah, relax. Trees down."
3665,"Oh, you mean Xmas. You must be using an archaic pronunciation. Like when you say ""ask"" instead of ""aks""."
3667,"Hey, hey. Let me aks you something: Would it cheer you up if we went and cut down an Xmas tree?"
3676,That's not true.
3742,Sorry I stormed out before. I didn't mean to ruin everyone's Xmas.
3744,It's just that I get tired of Fry always only thinking of himself.
3746,Wait! You mean he's still out? His life's in danger!
3748,I'm telling you why. Santa Claus is coming to town!
3751,Hi there!
3753,"You didn't need to buy me a present, Fry."
3755,It's OK. You're lonely and I'm lonely. But together we're lonely together.
3757,Merry Xmas.
3762,But we set things right. Fry even risked his life to get me a present.
3773,We're trapped.
3775,"Goodbye, Fry."
3786,(shouting) Somebody help us.
3797,(shouting; from outside) Help!
3809,Watch out! His belly is shaking like a bowl full of nitro-glycerine!
3838,"Look at you guys. No offence, Fry, but you've become a fat sack of crap."
3841,Come on. We're taking you pigs to the gym.
3848,"Uh, Fry, you're in the womens' steam room."
3851,Those poor 20th century women.
3855,"Hmm, somebody must have turned down the gravity. I'll fix it for you."
3859,Maybe you could do more rips with less weight.
3863,I wonder why Dr. Zoidberg is acting this way. Out of all of us he always seemed the most normal.
3872,(simultaneously) Stop!
3878,Bleck!
3885,"Fry, do you even understand the word ""invertebrate""?"
3898,It's amazing that your people can fall in love so fast.
3922,Why is Zoidberg the only one still alone?
3932,At least you didn't smell as bad as them.
3935,If a guy ever did that to me I'd know it. Wait a second. They've all been doing that to me. Even Sean!
3976,"Uh, me too."
3979,"Zoidberg said some dumb stuff but he's a nice guy, really. It's just that Fry's been telling him what to say and Fry's a ... do you have idiots on your planet?"
3981,"Yeah ... What? Look, never mind the words. Zoidberg's a doctor. A doctor honey."
4003,"Dr. Zoidberg, this is madness. You're being irrational."
4005,Aww.
4007,"Right, right.  You have to stop this madness."
4028,"(shouting) Come on, Fry! Die with dignity!"
4036,Wait! Stop! Everyone is gone.
4039,Ew!
4046,Fry!
4056,Hooray!
4072,"I'll get my coat. Let's go, Bender."
4074,Uh-huh. Now tell us she's witty and sophisticated.
4094,"OK, the sticker says 55,000 but we'll only go as high as say--"
4097,"Amy, you don't go up from the sticker price."
4103,Hermes. Who were you yelling at?
4106,You just assume I can't get a Valentine's date?
4137,Bender! Romance isn't about money.
4139,"For your information, it's because he's hideous."
4151,"Bender, this is stupid. Why would anyone come to you for romantic help?"
4168,You'll be back to zero soon enough.
4172,Fry--!
4174,I think you're over reacting.
4176,"Fry, she's pulling down billionaire trust-fund money."
4205,This sort of thing always happens with office romances.
4223,"So, how's business?"
4225,"Yeah, it's pathetic alright!  How much?"
4227,Done.
4229,No!
4234,"You're too late, Fry. I'm sharing Valentine's Day with a very special man. He's not Zapp Brannigan or anything!"
4236,Bender's in his office.
4271,"Nice ass, ass."
4286,(whispering) Bender! Did you just round up our dates at the bus station?
4300,"Why, if it isn't my favourite head on Amy's body: Fry."
4303,"Nonsense, the evening's young. So, Gary, what do you do for a living?"
4305,Really? Y'know I heard that banking industry regulations are really very simple.
4307,"Oh, I do."
4317,So how's the old corpse? Everything hooked up OK?
4319,Anytime. I actually enjoyed hanging out with you.
4321,Come on! It's not like you intentionally set us up with bad dates so we'd spend Valentine's Day together.
4323,No! You didn't! You just corralled a bunch of stiffs at the bus station and pocketed our money!
4325,Yeah.
4342,"Hey Bender, I thought you said you were in this episode."
4351,Sounds like your kinda place Fry. Wanna go?
4354,But Bender you are -
4361,"Ooo, ancient Wall Street."
4365,Do you know what it means?
4370,What were they used for?
4372,Oh. I-I'll be out in a sec.
4373,(reading) Tokens only. (talking) How does this work?
4376,What's this?  Another bathroom?
4379,Wow! The burial chamber of the 20th century's greatest spiritual leader - Al Sharpton.
4381,It says he was mummified in ceremonial vestments.
4389,"Fry, remember when I told you about always ending your stories a sentence earlier?"
4394,Did you drive much in the 20th century Fry?
4399,"You can't have whiplash, you don't have a neck."
4447,"Oh I get it, this is cute. You're jealous of Bender's new friend!"
4451,It's beautiful.
4458,"Uh Professor, can we discuss this somewhere else?"
4462,That's kinda pathetic.
4464,Not me.
4470,"Space banditos have been operating in this quadrant so you'll each take 8-hour shifts guarding the safe. First Bender, then Flexo, then Fry."
4472,"OK. First Bender, then Flexo, then Fry."
4474,"OK. First Bender, then Flexo, then Fry."
4504,What is it?  My God! Did you hear maracas?
4506,"Then it wasn't space banditos.  Bender, lock down the ship, don't let Flexo escape."
4508,How could Flexo have stolen the atom?
4510,No.
4512,Well you were sure right about Flexo being evil.
4514,"OK, thanks Bender. Let's fan out and look for him."
4516,(whispering) Keep an eye on Fry. We can't rule out the possibility that he did it.
4517,Aha!
4519,Fry? Why are you looking for Flexo in my underpants drawer?
4526,"Well, looks like Flexo got away clean."
4528,He must have jumped ship with the atom the second we landed.
4536,(whispering) Downplay the tiara.
4540,"200,000?"
4545,But Mr Barker -
4547,"Well gentlemen, it appears we're boned."
4549,Get him!
4555,I don't know which one to shoot.
4558,"Alright, enough of this.  There's the atom!"
4564,"I'm sorry we suspected you Flexo. It's just, what with the beard and all."
4574,"It figures. Who else but Zapp Brannigan would be judging the most chauvinistic, degrading, dehumanising -"
4576,"Wait, you're making a -  Ooo! Look at that.  I feel like a princess."
4578,I almost had that tiara.
4581,"Fry, that's a radiator."
4589,Good to see you.
4595,(whispering) Shh! You're gonna get us all assimilated!
4604,"Nah. I'm not in the mood for a historical documentary. I've heard good things about Quizblorg, Quizblorg."
4643,"Bender, do you know who that was?"
4659,No! You've got to do it. I don't care how suicidal it is.
4661,"This is more important than that marble-eating contest, Fry! It's about pride. Let me tell you a story from my childhood."
4663,"When I was growing up at the orphanarium, I got picked on a lot..."
4664,(voice-over) ...My only outlet was Arcturan Kung Fu.
4666,"But, Master Fnog, I can beat these dorks with one eye closed."
4668,What do you mean? Watch this!
4671,That's it. I'll take you on right now.
4673,I lost my chance to be a champion. I won't let you throw away yours.
4675,Let's see what you got. Touch your toes.
4683,"Get up, Bender. You can't quit every time you get an axe in the back.  Or a drill through your face. Now quit scratching your axe-hole and get out there."
4704,Bender! You're three hours late. You can't give up on your training now after both of us worked so hard.
4706,"I said ""us""."
4727,"No way! If you wouldn't take my help when you didn't need it, why should I give it to you now when you do need it?"
4729,I don't know. But I'm not helping.
4735,"Not Fnog! Bender, let's hit the gym. I'm gonna teach you to fight like a girl!"
4741,"According to the script, you're supposed to prance out and tickle him with your fairy wand. Instead, I want you to prance out and kick his head off!"
4753,"Keep laughing, Fnog!  Ready, Bender?"
4759,"OK, Fnog, that's enough. Call him off. Fnog?  Hmm."
4761,"So, once more we meet again."
4763,"You didn't train Destructor. You're just controlling him like a puppet. I mean, cheating in a fake fight. That's low!"
4765,"(ironic) Oh, right. Girls lack the will of the warrior!"
4770,Yes!
4779,"I'm proud of you, Bender. Sure, you lost. You lost bad. But the important thing is I beat up someone who hurt my feelings in high school."
4791,It smells like burning recess monkey.
4796,Follow me!
4798,It's got every piece of information anyone could ever want.
4803,Hey!
4809,Yeah. I'll stick with this one thank you.
4818,"I'm a woman if that's what you mean. I don't like to play games so I'll just say I'm a cyclops, I'm a spaceship captain, I'm the only one of my species and I'm interested in meeting a man."
4823,"We call it a ""video game."""
4827,Who are you?
4829,I can't believe it. I've dreamed of this moment all my life.
4831,"Fry, you idiot. Ever since I was abandoned on Earth I've been searching for who my people are and where they come from. Then I finally meet another Cyclops and you blast him. You wrecked my one chance to learn who I am."
4833,Come on. We have worked to do.
4835,"No, I'm just happy you were able to win a video game. Now lets concentrate on getting this desperately needed popcorn to the people of Cineplex 14 OK?"
4837,Huh?  It's him!
4842,It'll get there.
4843,After a whole life of searching I may finally have found where I belong.
4845,Look at that statue. It's only got one eye.
4848,Alkazar?  Are you real? Or am I seeing single?
4850,"After all this time. Somebody else with one eye who isn't a clumsy carpenter or, uh, a kid with a BB gun."
4852,Not at all!
4854,There's so much information and yet somehow I feel as if I know it all already.
4858,Oh please! Really?
4863,"Fry, that's offensive to our people. Isn't it?"
4866,"Oh no not at all. If anything, I'm more impressed."
4869,It's all so sad. What happened to our people?
4872,I heard you from my room. What's wrong?
4874,"Please, is it bout the fate of our people? Because I'm very interested in that."
4883,"Alkazar, I used to be a baby, it might have been me!"
4885,It's so tragic.
4887,It doesn't have to.
4889,You're a male and I'm a female.
4891,Wake up my king.
4893,"Uh, sure OK. What do you take with that?"
4895,Maybe after breakfast we can talk about rebuilding our civilisation.
4898,No.
4900,Look Alkazar.
4902,Look Al. I know you've been living alone a long time and I can sympathise but I'm not your maid.
4904,"OK OK, I'll do the dishes.  Hey where'd they go?"
4908,Al? I did my hair the way you wanted it.  Who are these people?
4910,"Hey, where'd you get this couch and that TV set and all this stuff?"
4912,"Too bad they weren't giving away the three things you actually need: Mouthwash, a back wax and stain-proof underwear."
4915,"Come on Al, can't you let the little guy out?"
4917,Why were you sneaking into my people's forbidden valley?
4919,I know.
4921,Fry if it's obvious to you with your learning disability then of course it's obvious to me! He's crude and gross and he treats me like a slave.
4923,I can't. If I leave Alkazar then that's the end of the Cyclops race. And I won't let that happen. Even if that means a lifetime of unhappiness.
4924,I'll break up with him at dinner.
4929,I'm trying.
4932,Yes! I Will!
4939,Animals go in the corner.
4941,"Look Fry I'd like to help you but it's my wedding and I'm kind of busy.  Here, try to be happy for me. That way at least one of us will be."
4962,I..d -
4971,Who's she?
4976,A little. That's why I've decided to hurt you until you explain it.
4978,Yeah!
4982,But why did you have all five weddings on the same day?
4984,"Alright Alkazar, I just have one last question for you."
4986,"If you can change form, why didn't you change it in the one place that counts?"
4987,Thanks for saving me from that creep Fry.
4989,"I guess I was so desperate to find out who I really was, I forgot who I really was."
4991,"Yeah. I mean, how many planets can there be?"
4995,I'm having a poker game tonight with some friends from my old cryogenics job. You guys interested?
5000,"We're playing poker. but I'm warning you, my friends are serious players."
5004,"Hermes, wait! We're having a poker party. Stay and whip off a batch of your famous jerk dip."
5007,Ah that must be my old boss.
5009,I know.
5013,But you never wore your ring. I didn't know you had a wife.
5067,Fry got his head stuck in a crater.
5071,I can explain.
5076,What?
5091,Co-pilot? Under who?
5093,That drunk?!
5101,"Bender, what happened to you?"
5127,You and Morgan were having an affair?
5133,"Well, those arguments aside, we're still going."
5135,Then we'll need a guide. Someone who's been there before.
5144,"Come on, I have a better idea."
5145,Excuse me? We're from the Planet Express delivery company. We're here to deliver a robot.
5148,"While you're crashing, could you tell us where all these canisters end up?"
5150,
5156,Where is it?
5158,"We're getting nowhere slowly. Here, I'll address this to the Central Filing room.  Then we'll track it using my wrist-lojack-amater."
5161,"This is it. We'll just run in, grab Bender's disk and run out. Got it?"
5171,But how did you know we were here?
5180,That's only four minutes from now.
5216,"Whatever you did Professor, I'm sure there's a reasonable explanation."
5225,"No Professor, it's a surprise party for your 150th birthday."
5240,No it isn't. You have another 10 years left.
5242,"No, he couldn't. When you turn 160, robots from the Sunset Squad take you to a mysterious planet and you never return."
5255,What?
5257,"Look, the Professor trusts me with a giant spaceship. He wouldn't trust the rest of you with his dentures."
5262,"Uh, Professor?"
5264,"Yes, we know."
5276,"Wait, if he's your clone then why doesn't his nose look like yours?"
5282,Never.
5290,Why you little -!
5347,Quiet. I think I know how to find the Professor.
5349,"If the smelloscope can pick up the Professor's odour, we may have a chance to save him."
5351,I'm zeroing in on him.  Bengay...mothballs......letters to the editor. It's the Professor!
5356,There it is! The Near-Death Star!
5357,"OK, we'll tell them the Professor escaped and we're bringing him back. Fry, you'll have to dress up like a 160 year old man."
5360,Now they may ask for a DNA sample.
5366,Your medicare dollars at work.
5368,"Uh, this is Professor Hubert Farnsworth. He escaped."
5383,Sounds nice.
5386,At least it keeps them from driving.
5387,Brace yourself for the worst.
5390,"He's hooked up to a life-support system. We have to disconnect him very very carefully, or the shock could kill him."
5398,"We're probably going to make it, but we might not."
5403,They've blown out one of our engines!
5405,Only the Professor knows how to fix it. We have to wake him up.
5409,"We can't you bastard, no one knows how it works. It's impossible."
5418,All right!
5424,It's a hundred times more horrible than anything I could imagine.
5433,"Hermes, that's sweet. I didn't know you cared about Nibbler."
5439,"The sun, the sea air, good friends."
5445,Bender!
5448,"I'm afraid you're both out of your league, boys, 'cause you're looking at a woman who owns her own harpoon."
5450,
5460,"Aha!  Gather round, chumps! I got the winner!"
5464,"Bingo! Whatever it is, it's 20 times heavier than a boot."
5474,"Wake up, everyone! I've got something. And this time it's alive!  Dr. Zoidberg, since when do you even wear boots?"
5476,"Come on, let's go home."
5480,"Come on, Bender. Pull in your line and let's go."
5487,It's pulling us under! Everyone into the ship!
5490,"Depth at 45 hundred feet, 48 hundred, 50 hundred! 5000 feet!"
5495,We'll be crushed if we don't equalise the pressure.
5500,"You did it, Fry!"
5503,"There, good as new! Except we're three miles below the surface, we don't have any food and the ship won't work underwater."
5506,"OK, everyone, calm down. The Professor and I will get to work on the ship. Bender, Zoidberg, since you can survive underwater, you'll go out and look for food."
5523,"Fry, swallow your food. Then talk."
5528,Sure she did.
5532,I'm afraid Fry is suffering from ocean madness.
5534,(whispering) Ocean madness.
5560,Where's Fry?
5564,"It's ocean madness alright. Sailors call it aqua dementia, the deep down crazies, the wet willies, the screaming moist!"
5585,"But tell us: How could a city with such a ... fabulous airport, end up underwater?"
5589,The magician?
5597,"But, Fry, what about us? What about your life on the surface? You don't belong down here."
5610,Whatever.
5627,Prepare for launch.
5630,It's you!
5633,"Fry, are you alright? What happened?"
5652,"(whispering) Bender, please try to be a little quieter."
5661,Ow! My eye! I'm blind!
5667,Um...a grey-ish blob?
5669,Um...a grey-ish blob?
5675,A week? What do you think Dr Zoidberg?
5679,I'm not deaf. I just have to wear this stupid eye patch. Does it look stupid?
5697,"Oh yeah, this salad's fantastic.  So fresh."
5700,Are you kidding me?
5708,You're charging us? After you blinded me?
5730,And hard working.
5739,I'm here and I'm getting along just fine thank you. My walk to work today just took a little longer than usual. Nibbler took me through the zoo for some reason.
5741,I don't need help. For you information I did this all by myself.
5816,I'm fine thank you. A real pilot can navigate by feel alone.
5827,I'm taking evasive action.
5829,"Stop bothering me Fry, I need full concentration."
5831,Eyesight is for chumps.
5834,"Wait. Why do the raised letters that normally say ""Turnmaster Steering company"" say ""Nibbler""? Oh no!"
5839,The engine's stalled. I'm trying the manual fuel pump.
5841,You'll never get away with this.
5845,"I'll assume that's a joke at my expense. Well, who's laughing now? Heyya!"
5850,(whispering) That guy sounds familiar.
5866,Bender!
5869,"I've got an idea. Hold still.  It's about to break, yes, yes!"
5870,(cheering) Alright!
5873,"Well, this is the big moment. It's finally time to take my patch off."
5875,I think it's Blotto. That gangster I saw when my patch fell off.  Professor? Where were you at 10pm last night?
5887,Dinner ready?
5890,Ugh! Great. We're two days from Earth with no food.
5894,Yeah. It's probably only got a Howard Johnson's.
5895,"Well, it's a type-M planet, so it should at least have Roddenberries."
5898,No.
5902,Hm. This thing I wear on my wrist says they're not poisonous.
5909,No. Only what we need. Stuff the ship.
5911,Roger!
5914,We haven't thought of a name yet.
5918,We can't call them that.
5920,"It sounds too much like those frozen rocky mountain oysters on a stick. You know, Test-cicles?"
5930,Good idea.
5953,Sorry. I was distracted by those protesters outside our building.
5959,(shouting) What do you people want?
5963,"You're vegetarians, who cares what you do?"
5965,Animals eat other animals. It's nature.
5968,I'll go get some more bricks.
5969,"Fry, I wish you'd throw out these week-old Popplers. They're getting big and scaly. Ooh, there's one left."
5971,Stop! Stop eating Popplers!
5974,Popplers are intelligent. This one called me mama.
5977,No!
5979,"Sorry, babies."
5982,"I'm telling you, it spoke to me. Come on, little Poppler, say ""mama""."
5991,(shouting) Stop eating Popplers! They can talk!
5993,"Hey, cut it out!"
6004,I am.
6016,That's not true. I have one right here that can talk.
6018,"Come on, say ""mama""."
6021,"Look, I'm saying eating meat is wrong..."
6023,I don't think anyone's here to make that claim.
6025,But eating an intelligent animal is different.
6034,Stop it!
6045,Eck!
6062,That's stupid.
6075,This is all a big load. I was the one trying to save the Popplers.  You were sucking them down like the fat hog you are and you were stepping on them for fun.  You both should be in here instead of me.
6078,"Oh, great, Captain Moron has a plan. Why don't you tell it to Wingus and Dingus here?"
6082,It doesn't look anything like me. The hair is all wrong.
6084,"You know, this might actually work. The Omicronians seem to have trouble telling one person from another."
6114,Go consummate yourself.
6116,Please! I just paid off my car!
6125,"(mumbling) Yeah, it is."
6132,"Thank you, Jrrr.  I hope you'll always think of me as your mom."
6134,Whoop!
6142,"Aww, thanks, guys. Pass the veal, please."
6146,Dolphin? But dolphins are intelligent.
6149,"Oh, OK."
6152,Pass the blowhole.
6164,Very nice. Where'd you steal them?
6169,So how are you gonna lug all those gifts to Mom's factory?
6178,"Um, alright."
6182,They're so lifeless-like.
6190,(reading) See through the eyes of a bender unit. (talking) Fine.
6210,"Well, see you back at the office. And don't forget to tell your mom you love her."
6237,"The toaster's not working right, either."
6247,Ow! Ow!
6252,Look out!
6255,"Bender, thank God you're here. Talk some sense into the other machines."
6263,Hey!
6279,(defeated) Zoidberg.
6307,Wait. Didn't you say Mom keeps the robot control in her bra?
6309,"Professor, you don't have to get back together with Mom. You just have to seduce her, get her bra off, and use the remote to deactivate the robots."
6319,Leela bring fire?
6325,Never heard of it.
6330,Wouldn't it work better if the wheels were round?
6332,Heyya!
6364,I'm worried. It shouldn't take this long to get to second base.
6394,"Too bad it didn't work out with Mom, professor."
6443,"Maybe later. I-I mean, I don't know what to ask about."
6447,"I can be really impulsive. It just takes me a while.  Alright, Professor! Let's do it. Make that machine show me what would happen if I was a little more impulsive. Just a little.  Not too much."
6448,"Hey, you guys. Look what I bought on a wild impulse: New boots. They're like my old ones but with a crazy green stripe. Woo! Never know what I'm gonna do next!"
6451,Hello? New boots!
6453,Yah!
6454,"Oh, God! What have I done?"
6455,"OK, just try to be nonchalant."
6462,That doesn't prove I killed him.
6464,(from meeting room) Hi-yah!
6468,No! Everything's just--
6470,"I'm sorry, I couldn't stop-- W-Wait. Don't you care that I murdered Hermes?"
6472,You're blackmailing me?
6474,"OK, that's it. No more killing! Next time you feel like killing just have a stick of gum.  Now to dispose of the body."
6476,Do you have any gum?
6479,Who are you?
6481,I've never seen you before.
6484,"Uh, couldn't be me. I never wear boots. See?"
6491,Could you get the lights on your way out?
6493,Lobster. Want some?
6495,Really?
6497,No.
6499,No!
6501,(crying) I don't know what came over me. I killed one person on impulse. Then I had to kill another. And another.
6503,"And now, to make sure you won't talk, I'm gonna have to do something really impulsive!"
6504,"So, Fry, what do you think of the impulsive new me?"
6506,Good. Now let me just get the lights.
6510,You idiot! We already saw that.
6516,What is it?
6589,Congratulations!
6597,You buy one pound of underwear and you're on their list forever.
6619,What is it?
6627,(reading) 0101100101. (talking) What does it mean?
6638,"Bender, what happened?"
6642,I think Bender may be telling the truth.]
6646,Look at this. They found those same rubbery tracks right here in New New York.  There was a hit-and-run by the robot porno theatre.
6671,That's crazy!
6686,There. No rampaging for you tonight.
6688,"Just relax, Bender. Tomorrow we'll pry you down, have a nice breakfast and then go hunt down and slaughter that ancient evil."
6690,"Well, goodnight. I'm gonna go make my dinners for the next month and freeze them."
6692,"(shouting) Fry, stay back!"
6695,Could you give me some help? I think Bender crushed my foot.
6700,"It was very sweet of you, Bender."
6703,"Enough with the feelings, you two. If we're gonna cure Bender we've got to go back to the castle and hunt down the original were-car."
6705,"Cursed, got it."
6707,The tracks lead here.
6709,"Now it's daylight, so he should be in robot form. But be careful. Many robots are stupid and violent."
6712,"We are not ignorant villagers, we're sophisticated New New Yorkers. Whup his butt!"
6736,So what happened to Project Satan?
6739,You guys distract the were-car and I'll kill it by plugging its exhaust pipe with this silver potato.
6741,It looks so unhappy. Excuse me? Are you Project Satan?  Don't be afraid. We know what you are.
6743,Would you like us to...put you out of your misery?
6746,Oh no! It's midnight.
6748,"Fry, distract him."
6750,"Oh no, there's no exhaust pipe!"
6754,Whoa!
6756,"Bender, you're cured! But what happened to Fry?"
6781,I wanna enlist. My friends always die if I'm not there to save them.
6783,What?!
6785,"You know, Zapp, someone ought to teach you a lesson."
6804,"(disguised, deeper voice) Uh, sorry, sir. I was still in attack mode. You know how testosterone is."
6806,"(disguised, deeper voice) Lee --  ..la...man. La Man...Lemon! Lee Lemon, sir."
6808,"(disguised, deeper voice) Pert and Popular, sir."
6817,"(disguised, deeper voice) Uh, hey, why the hell would I? We're all guys here. Sweaty, hairy, gassy guys."
6822,"Really? (disguised, deeper voice) What type is she? You know, blonde, or Chinese, or cyclops?"
6824,"(disguised, deeper voice) Aw, she sounds sweet."
6826,"(disguised, deeper voice) Stop! Stop flattering me!"
6828,"(disguised, deeper voice) Sir, the alarm. I think I'd better --"
6839,"Charge your gun, Fry."
6894,"(disguised, deeper voice) Maybe you should put on a towel, sir."
6901,"(disguised, deeper voice) Bomb?! What bomb?"
6910,"(disguised, deeper voice) Uh, commander? Could you tell me when the bomb is exploding?"
6919,(shouting) Come on. We gotta save Bender.
6921,"Fry, don't you recognise me?"
6924,"Hey, Zapp!"
6928,Let's do it again sometime.
6933,We're here. I followed the bouncing balls.  I'll keep the chopper at a safe altitude while you parachute down.
6935,(shouting) I already did!
6958,We couldn't disarm the bomb so we reset the word that triggers it.
6965,"Bender, stop trying to destroy the world."
6981,I must've left them onboard.
6983,Relax. The ship's not going anywhere. I anchored it with the unbreakable diamond tether.
6997,What did I do?
7011,"We don't need to beg, Bender. For God's sake, we're not veterans!"
7013,"No, we can get jobs."
7015,"Fortunately, I still have our old career chips."
7017,Career chips.  You remember? They assign you the job you're best at.  I tried to give you one and you ran away.  It's how we met!
7019,Just give me your hand.
7021,Baby!  Ow!
7022,I'd like to reapply for my old job: Counselling defrostees and assigning them careers.
7024,"Monday Monkey lives for the weekend, sir."
7026,Delivery boy? I must have mixed up the chips. It's a simple mis -
7048,"Pizza delivery for...I.C. Wiener.  Yeah, very funny. Now cough up the $12.95."
7050,It's only been 23 minutes.
7054,"Fry, just pay me. I still owe 30 bucks on this uniform."
7103,"Please, professor. Give us our jobs back. We deserve another chance."
7111,Forget about Fry. You can hire us back and he'd never have to know.
7113,"Oh. Hey, Fry!"
7127,Probably because he didn't fit in back in your time.
7190,"Fry, thank God we found you."
7192,It's not the year 4000.
7195,"But, when they noticed you weren't him, they chucked you in a ditch."
7199,Exactly: You're in L.A.
7216,"Hmm, I'd better check the fluid levels. (shouting) We're OK on Coke syrup."
7220,You're not gonna eat a sandwich from a truck stop men's room are you?
7226,Fry please. That's sweet but I'd rather not even dignify them with an ass whooping!
7248,What about that bathroom egg salad from the truck stop?
7258,So the eggs in that egg salad sandwich were -
7281,Look! A starling!
7285,"Uh...what if we go for a walk possibly because it's such a lovely day, perhaps."
7293,That's such a beautiful thought Fry. And what's more amazing you expressed it without spewing crumbs at me!
7310,Ugh! It's that jerk from the truck stop! Let's cross the street and try to blend in with that crowd of pimps.
7312,Fry no! He's bulging with what could be muscles!  Ooo!
7326,"I had a great time today. The flowers, the puddle, the way you hurt that guy. But can I ax you something?"
7328,Why did you do all that stuff?
7330,What is it? Is it about Bender?
7332,And Bender?
7334,You do?
7336,"Fry, that's the sweetest, most wonderful - wait! Recently? Like since you ate that toilet sandwich?"
7338,Stay here.
7344,Don't even think about tickling that ganglion!
7348,Perfect.
7352,So? Did you ever stop to think that Fry is better off with worms?
7359,I'm thinking of having a window installed.
7361,"Oh, that's the corniest thing I've ever heard! Let me show you the bedroom."
7363,A holophonor? Only a few people in the whole universe can play that. And they're not very good at it.
7365,I don't have words to say how wonderful you are Fry. I haven't felt this happy since double-soup Tuesday at the orphanarium.
7367,"Oh Fry, I love what you've become."
7369,What is it?
7389,Fry? I missed you. Did you find out what you needed to find out?
7391,You don't have to do that. I'm still seduced from before.
7393,What's that supposed to mean?
7395,What's happened to you?
7397,What? Why would you do that?
7399,Well...which of you wrote me that sonnet?
7401,I don't know.
7409,"Well, so has Fry. What's the big deal?"
7412,Yeah!
7415,Dr. Zoidberg? Are you OK?
7421,I didn't know you could take this thing off.
7429,What's wrong? Did you swallow your phone again?
7431,Men who call too much are the worst ... I bet.
7446,Forget it.
7448,How about zero?
7450,Zero.
7452,Zero.
7456,One.
7458,One half.
7466,Thanks.
7468,Half-date.
7470,Half-bottle.
7472,Quarter-shell.
7481,Lieutenant Kroker!
7485,This half-date is entirely over. Amy? Conference!
7489,"Alright, enough lipstick. Let's storm out."
7498,We're going home. Call us a space taxi.
7516,What planet is this anyway?
7534,"Fry, shut up."
7537,Where are all the men in your society?
7549,I'm already looking for apartments.
7558,So why did you make it your leader?
7567,There's no hurry.
7570,(ashamed) I'm afraid so.
7585,"Femputer, be reasonable. Sure men are annoying and they wreck up whatever planet they're in charge of. But most of these men are sorta my friends. They don't deserve to die."
7596,"Me too, meatbag."
7604,"We've got to do something. Bender, maybe you can interface with the Femputer and reprogram it to let them go."
7624,"We can't wait for Bender. It's time for a woman's touch.  Yah! Hi-yah! Yah, yah yah!"
7638,It's funny how the battle of the sexes was only resolved when a Manbot and a Fembot realised they loved each other.
7646,Guidance system?
7648,Autopilot?
7650,Dark matter indicator?
7652,All systems operational. Let's rock!
7653,"Gentlemen, I've completed my report on the crash."
7655,"Sabotage.  This is a normal L-unit. Without it, space travel is but the fevered dream of a madman."
7660,"And this, my friends, is the L-unit I just removed from the ship."
7663,Whoever did this was strong. This is 340 pounds of Tonka-tough steel.
7672,My God! Even the Professor's been bent.
7684,Surveillance?
7699,Hmm. Bender must have a pent-up need to bend that's not being satisfied by his bend-free lifestyle.
7773,Well talk to her. Tell her about your feelings in an open an honest way.
7852,"So Flexo and Angleyne had sex right there on the factory floor? Well, at least you got bending out of your system."
7859,"Bender, you've gotta help us."
7865,"Eh, it's fine."
7869,He ought to be with all the strict training I've been putting him through.  Nibbler: Roll over and you get a ham.  Roll over. Roll over for the ham.  You are so adorable! Who wants a ham?
7874,"The dog's good, but our real competition is the Hypno-Toad.  Your turn, Nibbler, honey. Herd those sheep!"
7883,"Shake paws, Nibbler. Come on, shake. He might be a little hungry. Shake, boy. Usually he's had more ham by now. Shake!"
7889,Me? Award? Him? Me? Good?
7891,Maybe they're right. Maybe Nibbler is dumb.
7894,Why is that good news?
7899,That's Earth.  The planet we live on.
7903,"(shouting) No! Nibbler, come back!"
7904,"Too bad Nibbler's not around. I guess I'll have to eat this raw, dripping ham by myself.  Nibbler?  Nibbler, you're scaring me.  Nibbler?!  Am I going crazy? Have my years of wild hedonism finally caught up with me?  Nibbler, help! Don't leave me here.  Uh, Nibbler? Could you scooch the seat up just a little bit?"
7917,"This is unbelievable. I thought you were a furry little moron. But here you are flying an adorable spaceship. If only you could talk.  Wait! I understood that!  You say you're transmitting your thoughts directly to my brain.  You say those awful flying brains are making everyone on Earth stupid?  Oh, stupider. And you go on to say that we're headed for your home planet where your race has lived since the beginning of the universe?  So, how did the universe begin?  Then the meaning of existence...? So every religion is wrong!"
7935,I'm not afraid.
7937,"So, your real name is Lord Nibbler? That's a coincidence."
7939,"Oh, you're all so cute!"
7941,Aww!
7945,"So why are these Brain Spawn attacking Earth, Nibbler?"
7948,Wipe out all thought? My God! They're like flying televisions.
7951,"Now, when you say ""special""..."
7954,Why would Fry be immune to the flying brains? Because he doesn't shower?
7958,Like a prom dress made from carpet remnants.
7962,You can count on me.
7971,I...have to tell...must...important...something...
7973,This! You for this!
7975,No!  Ow! Fire hot.
7978,Brain. Brain make people dumb.
7980,You go fight biggest brain of all.
7982,I 'unno!
7990,Duh...
7998,Icky!
8024,Is there Mrs. Queequeg?
8026,"Fry, don't die! Wake up!  (screaming) Nooo!"
8030,Me...feel...a bit better in cognitive faculties.
8035,Time for a diapee change!
8042,(cheering) Yeah!
8052,(awestruck) Your uncle was Harold Zoid?
8136,"No! It's the principle of the thing. Besides, I think I see a parking lot up ahead."
8156,"It's no use. The tar is too thick. Plus, I think I flooded it."
8173,"Oh, I always knew I'd die at the bottom of a pit. But a pit full of tar?"
8175,"It's some kind of hollow tube, devoid of human life.  The Los Angeles subway! We can blast our way in and escape!"
8205,"Fry, I know those cookies are fresh-a-licious but they produce an awful lot of trash."
8207,"And Bender, that aerosol head spray makes your head smell nice..."
8209,...but it's doing long-term damage to the planet.
8215,Dark matter oil? What if we hit something? The tanker could leak!
8217,Protestors?
8219,Why do we have to fly within three feet of this penguin preserve on Pluto?
8222,"At the risk of sounding negative: No! Look Professor, I can't participate in this mission."
8224,"This time it's your reckless disregard for the environment. In fact, I'm gonna go join those protestors."
8226,This is my normal jacket. I've had it for 10 years.
8235,Why do we have to resort to non-violence? Can't we just kick their asses?
8246,Get ready!
8250,"When you were planning this peace ring, didn't you realise spaceships can move in three dimensions?"
8254,Aww they're so cute! They're like if puppies and kittens could have babies!
8256,That's adorable.
8275,Bender's flying too low! And he's upside-down!
8287,Now you stay away from those puffin twins.
8289,Uh...I think I'll go check on Bender.
8292,"Bender, can you at least pretend you're being punished?  And clean the black parts too."
8299,Has anyone seen Bender? (shouting) Bender? Here robot robot robot.
8300,"Hey, why weren't you Kong donkeys outside cleaning up?"
8304,I'm worried about him. He didn't come back with the group.
8306,No. And with windchill it's 20 degrees below absolute zero. I'd better go find him.
8308,Why don't you just walk? He was only about 20 yards from here.
8319,How ultra?
8323,"Oh if only we hadn't flown penguins to Pluto and dumped oil on them, this might never have happened. Can't we stop them from multiplying?"
8325,What is it? We'll do anything.
8327,You can't shoot penguins. Isn't there some way to prevent them from breeding?
8329,"Well...I suppose...but...I mean...I joined Penguins Unlimited to love penguins, not to hunt them."
8331,(crying) Oh God it's inhuman! It's like Hong Kong! I'll do it!
8335,"Hey, you're enjoying this."
8337,I'm sorry but if it's fun in any way it's not environmentalism.
8339,Yeah...that is fun.
8342,"Alright, this is for their own good. Don't leave orphans. Gotta kill entire families.  But they're so cute. No! You can do this. It's just like murdering a little butler. I...I can't look. (crying) Oh no! What have I done?  Oh you poor little guy! I'm so sorry I - Bender?  What's going on? Were you hiding out with these little guys?"
8344,"Aww, they love you!"
8348,"Stop! Stop shooting! It's me, Leela."
8351,Not this way.
8353,"Look, I don't know if shooting penguins will help the environment or not. But I do know that the decision shouldn't be in the hands of people who just wanna kill for fun."
8355,No!
8363,They used to be such peaceful birds. I suppose this was your doing.
8365,"Oh, if only we had a toboggan."
8367,Phew!
8369,It's Fry!
8371,"Well, at least it'll help reduce their population."
8376,Well sure. I mean...not really...I mean...nature will work itself out. It can't screw things up any worse than we did trying to fix things right?
8402,How'd you do Fry?
8411,Hmm.
8414,I'll have a cholesterol free omelette with horse beaters.
8433,Well someone's in a good mode.
8443,Sure I'll do it.
8449,Well if we get bored I've got Tetris on this thing.
8455,No.
8487,Which way to your house? The sign says we're at 71st street.
8495,"The old comedians were right, this place is a lot different from LA!"
8503,He seemed nice.
8518,And yet you guys never had a single nuclear war.
8525,How do you know it didn't disintergrate?
8529,"Aw, brothers always fight. I'm sure deep down he loved you. He just never got a chance to say it before you got frozen."
8533,Hold the phone. If that's Yancy then why does the inscription read Philip J. Fry?
8540,"Survivor, Pat Benetar, The Scorpions. The list goes on."
8542,You went there this morning for doughnuts.
8551,It will be in a couple hours.
8560,They buried your brother in the world heroes section? I'm impressed.
8565,"(reading) Philip Fry, the original Martian."
8575,"Uh, Bender, I think Fry needs a moment alone."
8580,Could one of you guys get that?
8581,"It's a doorbell baby!  Hello, little guy. You know, I was abandoned as a baby too, so --"
8583,"Bender, stop! It's a baby!"
8585,"Oh, it's just a card -- from the orphanarium I grew up in."
8588,"No way, jose-bot. I never wanna see those other orphans again! Not after the way they used to pick on me."
8591,"How can you make fun of me, Kirk? You're blind!"
8594,"Well, I wouldn't mind rubbing my success in a few choice faces."
8598,Just like old times. Gosh. The bars on the windows seemed so much thicker back then.  Mr. Vogel? Remember me?
8600,You used to say that all the time!
8604,"Hey, look. It's our old group picture."
8606,That's me over in Cootietown.
8608,That's Adlai Atkins. I used to have kind of a crush on him.
8612,"Well, it's time to say hello to the old gang."
8616,"And what am I up to, you ask? Well I'm a very successful space captain."
8621,Hey! You can't feel sorry for me! I'm a space captain and you're all a bunch of losers.
8624,"Oh, yeah? Well, shut up, cane boy!"
8627,"Thanks, Adlai. I guess you never really outgrow being an eyeball -- oddball!"
8629,"Well, you know. It's just for a package delivery service."
8631,Huh. I'd never thought of it that way. So what do you do these days?
8633,"A tall doctor, you say?"
8641,You mean by beating them up? Because I've broken that blind kid's nose like 10 times and it doesn't make any difference.
8643,Me? Perfectly normal?
8652,"Oh, that's so sweet, Fry. But for once in my life, I just wanna look normal."
8654,You're right! I'll start by not caring what you think!  I'm getting the surgery.
8665,"Wow, look at me. Although I don't have the hang of blinking yet."
8667,I did it! I blunk!
8669,Hooray!
8673,I've never felt so unremarkable! Today I actually blended in with a crowd!
8685,That's so handsome of you.
8687,What are you saying?
8689,Sure!
8692,You're just jealous!
8694,"Fry, I just wanna try dating a normal man, who if you go somewhere with him no one says he's crummy. I think I deserve that once in life."
8696,"Actually, most doctors are rich."
8716,That sounds wonderful.
8719,"Oh, Adlai, I've had a wonderful time today. No one's stared at me or avoided staring at me or tried to burn me. You make me feel so not weird."
8721,Thanks for coming out to get to know my boyfriend. Isn't he dreamy?
8724,"Oh, Adlai, stop!"
8733,That's the dumbest question I ever heard!
8751,Us? Me? You? Kids?
8753,"Oh, Adlai, this is the most beautiful moment of my life!"
8771,"Adlai, I was thinking. Since we're both orphans, maybe we should adopt a child."
8774,"Hi, Bender. We'd like to adopt a child."
8778,I remember this from when we were kids: The warden would trot you out in front of prospective parents and they'd judge you like a piece of meat.
8780,Kind of fatty.
8782,"Uh, um."
8786,"Oh, I can't decide. We're gonna have to think about it."
8790,"Oh, they're all so adorable."
8793,"Officer, would it be alright if we adopted one of the kids?"
8798,I've made up my mind. Let's adopt her.
8800,"Come on, Adlai. She could really use a mom and dad."
8803,Well? So what? She may be different but she still deserves a good home.
8805,She doesn't need an operation! She's fine the way she is!
8807,Damn right I was!
8809,"Shut up, Fry. Now look, Adlai. I'm proud to be different. And I just wished I'd realised that when I was her age."
8811,Now take me to the hospital and put my eye back the way it was. Right now!
8813,"Listen, buddy. By the end of the day, one of us is going to have one eye."
8816,"Aww! You're a true friend, Fry. I guess there's nothing wrong with being a little weird."
8827,(unenthusiastic) Huzzah!
8867,(shouting) Fry! Just give a name. You don't wanna look stupid on Court TV!
8930,We're all trying to help you. We've petitioned the governor but he doesn't want to appear soft on people who've been falsely imprisoned.
8960,Thank God!
8963,"You've made a terrible mistake. He's a human being, not a machine. Oh, Fry!"
8967,"Oh, lots of reasons."
8991,You're not a tool-bot. You're not a food-motron. You're not a robot of any kind.
8993,"OK, this has gotta stop. I'm going to remind Fry of his humanity the way only a woman can."
8995,"(sexfully) Fry, this is for you."
8997,"Oh, for God's sake!"
9020,Wait! Take me first!
9031,Fry! Stay back. He's too powerful.
9043,"You did it, Fry."
9049,"Thanks for saving us, Fry."
9063,What's that? One of those Jefferson Starships I've heard so much about?
9071,Why won't it start?
9074,"Gas was an environmental disaster, anyway. Now we use alternative fuels."
9076,"Whale oil.  Bender, lift it up to the can opener."
9082,Come on.
9102,"Look, Bender. It's Patch Cord Adams. He heals with the power of laughter."
9132,Kinda cool.
9144,It got ruined in the wash.
9167,Mind if we crash here tonight? The colours in the van are keeping us awake.
9176,"This coming together of superstars really means a lot to you, doesn't it, Bender?"
9186,They're beautiful.
9195,We're home.
9206,"Rock it, Bender!"
9275,And I forgot this isn't a hovercar.
9279,"Quick, grab his footcups."
9282,Bummer.
9296,"Those aren't swan boats, they're swans."
9307,"They're only a foot high, professor."
9312,Your face can take a lot of punishment. That's good to know.
9314,"Alright, cool your jets, hotshot."
9316,"No, I mean cool your jets. They're melting Bender's face."
9318,Here you go. Hot off the nebula.
9324,Shh!
9349,"I don't know what you did, Fry, but once again you screwed up. Now all the planets are gonna start cracking wise about our mamas."
9383,"Fry, that's so sweet. Let me see."
9384,How exactly will this protect us from time jumps?
9388,"Dr. Zoidberg, can I talk to you about Fry?"
9390,...Does the worst W.C. Fields imitation I've ever seen. Zoidberg!
9392,"The thing is, Fry is very sweet. But he's so immature. I love his boyish charm but I hate his childishness."
9410,Just a few...more...hundred...thousand...miles. There!
9412,"We'll have to run some tests back on Earth, but I think we've stopped the time skips."
9419,"Moderately-priced, domestic, non-vintage champagne? How did you know?"
9421,"Aww, that is so true and sweet."
9423,"Fry, please try to understand. You're a man, I'm a woman. We're just too different."
9425,"Alright, but I wanna lick the beaters."
9429,"Fry, what are you doing?"
9432,"Yeah, actually. You're doing OK. The core reactor temperature's nominal, the blinker's off."
9434,"Is that what this is all about? Please, just cut it out now."
9436,"Fry, stop. I don't wanna hurt you, but there is absolutely, positively no way that you and I will ever, ever -"
9443,"You tricked me into marrying you, didn't you?"
9445,How'd you do it? Drugs in the champagne? Hypnosis?
9449,"Well, let's divide up the china. I guess I'll take the NFC helmets and you can have the AFC helmets."
9490,"Careful with that doomsday device, Bender."
9492,Roger.
9494,"It's OK, Fry. You know we'll always be friends, right?"
9496,I guess not.
9498,"OK. Let me just take the ship out to a safe distance.  Actually, I think I'll go down and prep the detonator. Fry, why don't you take the helm?"
9502,"Detonation in three, two, one."
9506,Then what?
9526,"Hey, you know what might be fun?"
9528,Let's take the rest of the morning off and take Fry to do everything he ever wanted to do.
9530,Except that.
9533,"Wow, the most humdrum activities look almost exciting through your eyes. What should we do next?"
9545,Keep your palms flat.
9552,"Wait, hold on. It is actually possible to meet any celebrity you want."
9554,Of course! You should read a blimp sometime.
9556,It's simple. You can download a celebrity's personality and appearance into a blank robot.
9567,Let's search the web.  Over there.
9579,"Well, you downloaded Lucy Liu. Are you just going to stare vacantly at her and not say anything?"
9603,"Bender, this is Fry's decision. And he made it wrong, so it's time for us to interfere in his life."
9604,She doesn't really love you. She can't. She's just a machine that -
9619,Did that make any impression on you Fry? Fry?
9623,But Fry's our friend Bender.
9625,You stifle Bender.
9627,Although he is completely right.
9645,We can't take that chance. Move people move!
9647,She asked first.
9655,Hey look its another Lucy Liubot.
9660,Alright Liu. Time to kick your frosty well toned ass! Heyya!
9675,Fry?
9678,"Fry, a herd of Lucy Liu are destroying the city. Is yours acting normally?"
9683,And Nappster says illegal copies never hurt anybody.
9686,Oh no. They're forming a human pyramid...of robots.
9690,Dr Zoidberg cut open that bag!
9692,And don't eat it.
9721,Fry get up here it's starting!
9728,I don't know what happened but we've taken on a lot of clocks.  Let's get back home.
9729,Why is there so little traffic around Earth?
9732,Oh no! There's no global positioning signal! Navigation is failing!
9734,"Not if I can help it!  Oh, I guess I can't. Everyone put on your seatbelts."
9738,"Alright, here's the plan. Zoidberg, pick up the pieces. Everyone else, take five."
9748,Have you seen today's news?
9750,No over here!  Flying Saucer Captured!
9758,No problem. The ship's fixed except for the cup holder and I think I can have that operational within 10 hours.
9760,"Well, I'm sure we can buy a microwave from somewhere around here.  Meanwhile you guys sneak onto the army base and rescue Bender's body."
9786,"Fry's from around this time, I'll talk like him."
9787,Yo homes! We're looking for a microwave oven.
9789,"Oh I'm sorry, now I'll ax you again: Where can we find a mi-cro-wave?"
9816,I'll just have a small injection of femislim.
9818,"Well, settle in. Without a microwave we're trapped in this time period."
9820,Wait a second. There's a microwave radar dish at the army base. We could steal it!
9824,Wait. If you killed your grandfather then why do you stll exist?
9863,Snap out of it!
9871,Heyya!  Ya!  Ya!
9884,Don't you need this one?
9887,Anything?
9905,We're pushing as hard as we can.
9910,Yeah!
9914,Awful! Let's read some more. (reading) Dear Santa.
9919,Fry's right. It's time to sit on Santa's lap -- and hard!
9920,"Oh, look! A cute little welcoming party."
9936,We'll need help getting in. Any volunteers?
9945,"Santa's a robot, so we should be able to destroy him with a logical paradox. Bender, you'd better cover your ears."
9947,"Hold it Santa!  Consider this: You are programmed to destroy the naughty. But many of those you destroy are in fact, nice. I submit to you, that you are naughty, and logically, you must destroy yourself."
9949,Wait! This is what we're running from!
9952,I don't know. Usually when I do stuff like this the ship moves.
9965,Bender!
9973,"(singing) Then you'll all work triple shifts,"
9976,"(singing) And though you're cold and sore and ugly,"
9984,(singing) And they're made from inferior wood.
9988,"(singing) You did the best you could, br>I guess that some of these gorillas are OK,"
10010,"Remember, Professor: Bender is Santa. So we don't need to hurt him, right?"
10013,(shouting) Professor! Don't you remember what I told you?
10033,It's not fair. I just hope that dumb chicken is ashamed of himself.
10039,"Outta my way, shrimp-oh. We're here to bring Santa back so we can prove Bender's innocent."
10041,There.
10043,The pollution from the factory. It caused a greenhouse effect.
10048,Especially for Bender.
10055,Stop the execution!
10058,You got the wrong Santa. And I'll prove it.
10083,"This wangs chun! After all the good we tried to do, Xmas turned out as rotten as ever."
10088,"What are you talking about, you crouton? You said it yourself: Xmas should be about bringing people together, not blowing them apart."
10100,That's so plausible I can't believe it!
10105,How does it work?
10117,Bender it's OK to be pround but don;t be a show off.
10123,Bender you drank and smoked when you were a robot.
10131,Stop him.
10133,No.
10142,Well that's not so bad.
10181,"Oh my god, he ate Fry! Fry is dead!"
10184,Invaders! Possibly from space!
10196,Come on Fry get it!
10207,Sure thing Professor!
10217,"OK, ahem. As an alien who was abandoned on Earth, I've never really belonged anywhere."
10221,So my question is this: What if I found my true home?  Ow!
10222,Where are we?
10223,"Nibbler, I don't think we're in New New York anymore.  Jeez, apparently the phrase tone it down doesn't exist on this planet.  Oh no! We hit someone! Quick, back into the ships.  Ooo, nice boots!"
10225,A witch? That explains how these boots magically appeared on my feet.
10227,"Well...its hard to find shoes that fit me. So anyway, who are you people? Haven't I seen you in some copyrighted movie?"
10230,"Yeah, can anyone fix my ship so I can get home?"
10232,You mean that yellow brick road?
10234,Oh thank you.
10237,"Wow, a talking scarecrow. Wanna come with us to see the Professor? He might be able to give you a brain."
10240,Whiskey OK?
10248,Why did you bring us here?
10251,"And live here? And be a witch like you? Yeah, alright. As long as I get to hurt people and not just dance around at the equinox."
10253,"Oh mommy, I found my true home!"
10261,We're here to see the Professor.
10263,Oh for the love of Benji.
10274,No not anymore. I wanna stay here and become the new Wicked Witch.
10276,"Uh, alright. Here I go.  There's no place like - I wanna be a witch!  Oh no, help, what's happening?"
10280,I was having the most wonderful dream. Except you were there and you were there and you were there.
10291,Bender! Ship! Stop bickering or I'm going to come back there and change your opinions manually!
10303,Check!
10307,"Oh you have got to be kidding!  Ow! Ow! I mean, aww thats so sweet!  Ow! I mean, (soppily) Aww dats show shweet!"
10317,Does that dummy have a brother?
10322,Perhaps. What's your point?
10326,Ooo look! You taped up the cracks in the dark matter reactor!
10338,I'm not impressed by a guy's message Fry. I'm impressed by the guy. Or not.
10340,What was that?
10346,Bender!  What's going on in here?  Planet Express Ship! Cover your shame!
10350,"Bender, dating your co-worker and primary mode of transportation is immoral, illogical and a violation of interstellar shipping statute 437-B."
10352,"Still, given the chance, I've given to urges far more shocking."
10357,Well just remember we all still have to work together. So try and let her down easy.
10360,Ugh. Doesn't it bother you even a little to be taking advantage of your girlfriend's trust?
10387,Planet Express Ship is something wrong?
10389,"Uh, no."
10391,"Uh look, I'm not saying Bender's not great but have you ever considered that maybe he's...y'know...not that great?"
10393,Could you maybe pay a little more attention to these asteroids?
10407,"Steady, Planet Express Ship. Focus on diverting all power to the scramjets."
10411,"Well, it was a spectacular battle but there doesn't seem to be any permanent damage."
10413,"Aww, calm down. I'm sure Bender is taking this just as hard as you are."
10417,"I know, I know. Look Ship, if there's one thing I learnt from my mutual breakup with Sean that was totally mutual its that happiness can only come from within you."
10419,Trust me. You can't change men anymore than you can change the laws of time and space.
10424,The ship's just taking the breakup a little hard. (whispering to Fry) She's nuts!
10429,"Look, I don't know if you want my opinion -"
10431,Now look missy! If you don't trun around now I'm going to have to shut down your brain!
10436,This is the one place she can't hear us. Everyone just pretend to shower.
10438,Now here's the plan.
10440,Comprendez Bender? You'll have to distract her. Merge your program with hers while I shut down her brain.
10442,I'm willing to take that risk.
10449,"OK, Bender has her distracted. Now I can shut down her brain by deactivating the carbonated logic matrix.  Ugh. I can't concentrate with this obnoxious candy in my face."
10451,Fat chance.
10453,Give it up Fry! I've got to pop these tops in a precise order.
10454,Halfway there. The ship should be getting a little less rational now.
10456,Only a few more.  Hey! I won free admission to Six Flags! Just one more reason we must survive this.
10458,Fry! I'll read your candy later! When we're not dead!  What was that?
10462,"Last one!  It worked! Gravity normal, air returning, terror replaced by cautious optimism! We did it Fry!  Fry?  You gave me your oxygen? Oh no! Breathe Fry breathe!  You leave me breathless! Happy Valentine's Day Fry!"
10466,Well at least it sounds like you were able to keep your conciousness seperate from hers.
10469,"Nah, I've got a lazier idea."
10474,Really?
10503,Thank you very much. Like many of you I never knew my parents...
10505,...I don't know if they were mighty alien overlords or simply underpaid alien janitors who fought crime on the side --
10508,"...In the end though, it doesn't matter who my parents were. All that matters is what I learned here, within these unscalable walls, that I have strength to make it on my own, just like all of you kids here today."
10514,Yes! I mean no! Just make sure you get my nonchalant side!
10517,"(crying) It's OK, Fry, I'm fine. I won an award today."
10519,"I'm sorry you saw that, Fry. I usually try to keep my sadness pent up inside where it can fester quietly as a mental illness."
10521,"I told a whole crowd today that being an orphan made me strong. But all I really wanted was a mom and dad, to hold me and stroke my hair and tell me they loved me."
10523,That's not even close to what I had in mind.
10525,"I know.  Sometimes when I'm lonely, I look up at the sky and I get this feeling that somewhere, on some unknown planet, circling a distant star, my parents are up there, looking down on me."
10528,"Bender! Cut it out! First of all the sewer mutants will be mad. Second, everything else that's horribly wrong with what you're doing!"
10537,Punishment?
10547,Who said that? How do you know my real name?
10551,I don't know. I think I saved us somehow.
10556,Great chichi's ghost!
10558,It looks like...a timeline of my whole life.
10560,And here's when I dropped out and bummed around India for a while.
10562,Its like some kind of weird Leela museum...and I'm the Leela!
10564,It's all the best stuff I ever flushed down the toilet! Those are some of my diary pages. And my screenplay!
10566,"Oh, I'm scared!  My whole life has just been a show for some perverted mutant!"
10578,Wait a minute. Why aren't you gonna kill us anymore?
10591,(shouting) Don't worry! I'll be fine! (talking) They know something about me and I've got to find out what.  The lake didn't mutate me. What is going on here?!
10593,Eurgh!  Who the hell are you?
10611,Where did they go?
10613,Ew!
10632,Hands up!  Tentacles too!
10634,What is all this?  Am I a game to you? Or some kind of even more boring Truman Show? Do you belive I'm you Messiah? Your Mutant Dali Lama? Stop me if I guess it!
10637,"(angry) And what about this?!  How did you get this bracelet? Did you steal it from me when I was a baby? Or from my parents. You robbed my parents, didn't you? I bet you sick mutants killed them. My parents were confused aliens lost on Earth and you killed them! Is that it? Admit it!"
10640,Because of you I'll never know my parents. I'll kill you!
10643,They killed my parents!
10645,They are my parents.
10648,What does it say?
10652,"So, I'm not an alien? I'm a mutant."
10655,(crying) You're my parents. All I've ever wanted is to know you.  This is the happiest moment of my life.
10663,"Thanks so much for inviting us, Mr. Wong. I've never been to a Mars Day barbecue."
10689,"How can you call the Native Martians ""stupid""?"
10692,"I can't believe you're laughing at the tragic exploitation of a proud, bead-loving people."
10694,Of course it is. But you don't have to laugh!
10734,What happened to the buggalo?
10757,She's got a fine coat.
10763,"Wow, look at that: Olympus Mons. The tallest volcano in the solar system."
10765,Right in front of you.
10772,"OK, my turn to tell a ghost story. Once, there was this woman driving--"
10776,"Fine, Mr. Know-It-All-About-Something-Finally, you tell a story!"
10798,Not unless your parents have thousands of helicopters at their disposal.
10804,(shouting) Sandstorm!  We're in the eye of the storm!
10808,Who are they?
10834,"Aw, look. Betsy followed you, Kif!"
10841,What about the Great Stone Ass of Mars?
10848,They have such respect for the planet.
10860,"Ow, ow, ow, ow! My eye!"
10866,"Yay, Kif!"
10884,It's a gigantic diamond! That thing must be worth a fortune.
10891,But what about your sacred land?
10909,Bender? Did you have something to do with this?
10950,Bender shush. You're supposed to be dead.
10958,We're trying our best.
10976,"Impressive, who's building it?"
10978,Say again?
10982,That's the only thing about being a slave!
10990,Are you crazy? They worked thousands of people to death to make these stupid monuments.
11000,"Bender, quit giving the slave drivers pointers!"
11027,Yeah! Play those bongos!
11040,Oh Lord!
11045,This society is a bunch of idiots.
11048,What did he say?
11055,Ow!
11065,Good riddance.
11069,You jerk. Why'd you have to drag us along?
11071,Did you really think you'd need all this junk in the afterlife?
11073,Well rot in peace. Fry and I are leaving.
11076,It's explosive! Maybe we could escape by setting fire to the distillery and blowing this whole place to rubble! Let's get a little kindling going!
11078,"Oh right, how selfish of me. We'll just stay here forever. Hey Fry, remember that robot ""Bender""?"
11080,No. But I bet it wasn't someone who was good at stealing.
11088,Oh Bender! When did you come in? Hold still!  Let's blow this tomb!
11092,"Bender, I understand your desire to be remembered. But you don't need a statue for that."
11094,No. You have your legacy as a brutal tyrannical dictator. And that will outlive any monument.
11103,Space pirates!
11105,"You know, pirates - but in space."
11111,Fry to battlestations. Fire torpedo number three.
11114,That's not torpedo three. That's not torpedo three at all.
11119,It's no use. We were going full speed when we fired him so he's going even faster than that.
11121,I don't know how to say this Fry. But Bender is doomed to drift through space...forever.
11197,"Look, I miss Bender almost half as much as you do but you can't bring him back this way. It's hopeless."
11200,"Well, you obviously won't listen to reason, so I guess I'll listen to idioticness and come with you. But we'll need a Sherpa to guide us."
11210,"(shouting) Fry, if I drop dead from exhaustion make sure my body freezes in a dignified position. None of that huddled over for warmth crap."
11213,Looks rickety. We'd better test it.
11227,How long have you been at it?
11231,Sort of like a giant kareoke machine?
11233,Not really.
11240,Heyya! You're order may be famous for it's martial arts. But I've never met a holy man I couldn't clobber.
11242,Oh. Then get in the laundry room or I'll kick your butts!
11264,"Fry, it's been three days. And even if you stay here the rest of your life, there is virtually no chance of finding him. It's time to give up."
11271,This is by a wide margin the least likely thing that has ever happened.
11274,Oh no the monks. We forgot to let them out of the laundry room.
11297,But the movie -
11299,This toads the wet sprocket. What about our thousands of shares of stock?
11330,Second.
11333,"I vote my 10,000 shares for the Professor."
11339,"40,000? How come you have four times as much stock as the rest of us?"
11385,Uh hello? We haven't made one delivery since you two took over.
11389,That was terrible! People won't even know what we do.
11391,Did you approve that awful ad Fry?
11393,Oh Lord!
11413,Fry we're worried about Planet Express.
11416,You've changed Fry.
11420,"I don't care what Ms Johnson says, Thst Guy's turning this place into some kind of...business."
11430,Just leave us alone and let us clear out our lockers.
11454,Zoidberg owned 51% of the company?
11469,They are? Oh my God! I'm a millionaire! Suddenly I have an opinion about that capital gains tax!
11487,Let Mom buy the company! We all wanna be filthy stinking rich!
11490,Hell yeah!
11504,Oh put down the binoculars Fry. The wall of that strip club isn't going to collapse twice in one day.
11506,That story stunk. Hand me the binoculars. I think the owner is from Cygnus 5.
11508,Professor please. Society's never gonna make any progress until we all learn to pretend to like each other. Now lets go over there and make these hideous strangers feel welcome.
11516,I don't mean to offend but this tastes like vomit.
11518,"No, actually I did mean to offend a little. This is awful."
11535,"(shouting) Sorry about that, I guess I needed a few more warm-up pitches."
11538,"(shouting) I didn't mean to hit you, I have some trouble with depth perception."
11547,But I've got a no-hitter going.  You're right. Here.
11550,Am I under arrest?
11553,The Mets? Those bums are worse than me.
11555,You mean I'd be the first woman ever to play major league blernsball?
11557,"Wow, the first woman ever to play major league blernsball."
11559,Yippee!
11560,Ta-da! The first woman ever to play major league blernsball. How do I look?
11563,All the whole numbers have been retired.
11565,Fry I'm a professional athlete! So go ahead.
11586,"Bender, how did you get in here?"
11587,Since when are you my agent?
11589,Bender that's great! How much did you get me?
11591,"(reading) As a pitcher, I serve up plenty of bean-balls, so I know good beans when I see them. Bean-Bay Beans - they're the beaniest!"
11595,So what did you get me?
11597,"Yo soy muy malo en lanzar, pero yo soy muy bueno en comer frijoles. Come los Bean Bay frijoles, los frijoles de los reyes."
11602,"Aww, sure thing sweetie. Who should I make it out to?"
11604,"That's a popular name today. Little ""e"" big ""B""?"
11606,I'm not doing this for the wad. I'm doing it for all the struggling female athletes who need a role model.
11608,What? Who are you?
11610,"Oh, following in my footsteps?"
11613,"I'm a fool. The fans haven't been cheering for me, they've been cheering at me."
11615,(crying) That's what makes it so sad. I thought I was doing something heroic.
11617,"You're right. I can't let people down anymore. As God as my witness, I vow to earn the respect of girls and women everywhere. I will become the best blernsball player of all time."
11619,Oh. Then I have a new vow. I solemnly swear that I will become not the worst blernsball player of all time.
11622,"Ah, here we are - the worst player in history. If I can be just a little better than him I can slink away with my head held high."
11625,It's even a crummy hologram.
11630,"So Hank - the bad Hank, just how blowful were you?"
11636,"Look, I don't wanna be in this exhibit. That's why I need your help - so I can be one tiny iota less pathetic than you."
11640,"(quietly) Alright, low and away!"
11642,"You mean ""keep your eye on the ball""?"
11646,"OK, eye off the ball."
11650,I didn't hit the batter! For once I was pitching and not just belly-itching!
11665,"Come on skipper, it's my last chance to prove I'm not the worst player ever. Please put me in."
11668,I can.
11670,I've been training with Hank Aaron.
11672,I've been training with a Hank Aaron.
11680,"(quietly) Keep cool, she's just like any other player. She puts on her sports bra one arm at a time."
11682,Strike one - a personal best!
11687,"Jackie. I guess you were right, I'm a lousy role model. I'm sorry."
11689,(crying) I was?
11691,"Oh, that's so kind of you. I guess I made a difference afterall!"
11693,Hey kid! Catch!
11707,Nice!
11715,"Alright don't panic. If we can get to the ship, we can fly north and hide under the polar icecaps for a few weeks."
11733,How interesting Dr Zoidberg. Do go on.
11737,It's unbearable! How much do you think it would cost to get my tongue removed?
11869,"Yes, we were there. And we just finished watching it on TV."
11875,I'm in!
11886,Wait! He plead not guilty.
11888,"The Professor said he was taking a brief nap, so we only have time for six movies."
11892,(whispering) Sh! Those words are forbidden!
11894,Sh!
11931,You can't go to Omega 3; It's forbidden! I forbid you!
11933,But it's set 800 years in the past!
11936,"Well, that is touchingly pathetic. I guess I can't let you go alone."
11938,We're entering the Omega system.
11941,I've lost control of the ship!
11966,But who's doing all this for you?
11975,Go  yourself.
11985,What?
11999,For one hundred quatloos: Who did the captain maroon on Ceti Alpha V?
12002,Correct.
12008,"Uh, you probably don't want us to see you rehearsing, or it'll give away the ending."
12010,We'll go wait in the ship.
12015,"I didn't wanna leave them either, Fry, but what are we supposed to do?"
12017,"Hmm. If we can re-route engine power through the primary weapons and reconfigure them to Melllvar's frequency, that should overload his electro-quantum structure."
12028,Fire!
12030,Its not working! He's drawing straight from our weapons.
12033,"So, uh, how's rehearsal going?"
12045,Can we get on with this? My foot's getting tired!
12053,"There, we can make these into spears."
12066,Then do it the wrong way.
12068,Is that all you've got? Hi-yah!
12091,We can't use our ship; We have life support but the engines are wrecked.
12093,"Hey, if your engines work--"
12096,"We're too heavy. You guys need to lose some weight, fast!"
12102,The Nimbus! We're saved!
12105,"You started this stupid court martial. Now if you don't mind, we're still fighting Melllvar!"
12106,One more hit and we're done for!
12129,Heyya!
12131,"No! Nibbler, don't drink the pool water! It's full of chlorine!"
12145,"Well, we just need one of those big ice cubes. Someone should call the losers who are supposed to deliver it.  Hello?"
12154,No he didn't.
12157,Completely out of ice?
12172,Bender a turtle isn't yourself. Why do you care about it?
12176,"You're both alcoholic, whore-mongering, chain smoking gamblers?"
12238,Come on. You've got to come out of your chest sometime.  Would you do it for a Bender snack?
12240,Gotcha!
12245,We all figured that out.
12278,Some lazy or polite robot is holding it in.
12325,It says this part of The Hustle implores the Gods to grant a favour. Usually a Trans-AM.
12333,"Fry, its been three days. You can't keep boogie-ing like this. You'll come down with a fever of some sort."
12391,"Sorry, but we need to practice hand to hand combat in case an enemy knocks the laser gun out of our hands and they slide waaay across the room."
12393,
12404,Woohoo!
12415,No!
12429,Acting like a moron won't bring your dog back.
12446,Bender's been down there too long. I'm going in after him.
12468,Hey hey! We can all fight when we're drunk. Now listen: Why don't we just brew our own beer?
12470,"Sure, the kids at the orphanarium used to do it all the time."
12488,"Let's see. We've got our malt, our hops...we just need a big disposable tub to mix it in."
12490,Now it needs to boil for a couple hours.
12498,Actually Dwight you're right. Alcohol is very very bad...for children. But once you turn 21 it becomes very very good! So scram!
12513,Mmm. The ingredients are cooked. And they've picked up some of your natural robot flavourings. Time to add the yeast.
12515,Talk to me.
12519,If you were my kids you'd get quite a talking to...from your father......when he got home from the senate.
12552,Ooo! Let me feel.  Have you thought about what to name it?
12581,You know how much an apartment that big would cost on the Sun?
12587,"Uh guys, I don't know how to tell you this. So I'll just let Fry blurt it out thoughtlessly."
12590,Dwight and Cubert made us a better offer. We're paperboys now.
12594,We're on it Mr Farnsworth!
12612,And what's your scientific basis for thinking that?
12619,You're doing great!
12629,"Hello, Awesome Express, the rude, crude delivery dudes! How may I direct your call?...What's that?...You haven't gotten your paper?...In how long?..."
12732,"Cool your jowls, Nixon. You may not like it that Dr. Zoidberg desecrated a flag. You might even find the image of it festering in his bowels somehow offensive. But the right to freedom of expression is guaranteed by the Earth constitution."
12743,I'll ask the head of the ACLU. Once he's done singing.
12802,"Dr. Zoidberg, how can you claim to love freedom and then enslave all of Earth?"
12808,This can't go on. Today is the day we fight back!
12810,"Oh, you're right. Tomorrow is the day we fight back."
12814,An idea?
12838,"Zoidberg, you set us free! I feel like I could stand to hug you! I can't, but you know what I'm trying to say."
12852,Yeah. You got a telesonic transmission from Kif a couple hours ago.
12868,"This is a very long trip, so we'll all have to go into hibernative-naptosis to save oxygen."
12874,"OK, I was just at this part: Heyya!"
12905,Grab on!
12914,And not one of those bogus everyday miracles like a sunrise. Aren't you a male?
12939,"Wow, this is all so confusing."
12943,Sorry I got your boyfriend pregnant.
12945,To motherhood.
12961,It means a lot to me. It's the basket my parents left me in at the Orphanarium.
12978,If it's so dangerous I'd better go with you. A gal has to protect her DNA.
13010,Amy!
13018,There goes my DNA. What a disgusting and beautiful process.
13026,"Hi Mom, hi Dad! Ready for your big trip to the surface?"
13028,"Dad, relax. You are being so mutant!"
13030,"No one's wearing anything adorable over their head. Now listen, I could never ever be ashamed of my parents. I'll see you this weekend."
13031,"Hey, guess who I just got off the videophone with?"
13033,My parents! They're coming up from the sewers for a visit Sunday.
13035,I'm getting them a special one-day surface permit from Citihall.
13037,Sure. Bare hands or weapon?
13045,"Man, I'm sore all over. I feel like I just went ten rouns with Mighty Thor."
13050,I don't believe that story for a second.
13057,What the? Hey! Quit it!  Heyya!
13060,How did we manage to survive? What gave us those strange powers?
13062,"Fry, shut up and look at this! (Reading) May cause superpowers in humans!"
13064,"Let's see, which powers do we have? Super-strength?"
13066,Uh-huh. Lickety speed?
13068,Yes sir!  Ability to command a loyalty of sea creatures?
13070,Ain't got that.
13072,"Wow, superpowers! I'll be able to pack my day with twice as many humdrum activity."
13074,To have parents.
13076,"Hmm, I have been looking for a way to serve the community that incorporates my violence. Let's do it!"
13079,It's true. Thanks to this funky fresh cream.
13082,We'd love to have you on the team Bender. But aren't you more on the supply side of crime?
13086,(shouting) Sorry! (whispering) A new era of justice has begun.
13088,Clobberella!
13097,Are you crazy?? We have to keep our secret identities secret.
13099,Especially from everybody.
13101,"For one, superheroes cause a lot of collateral damage, and we don't wanna get our butts sued."
13103,"Also, if our identities get out, every crook in the city will be after us. Or, God forbid, our loved ones."
13106,Thank you Mayor Poopenmeyer.
13108,Shh!
13110,"Well, so long. Keep in touch."
13112,"Oh, I completely forgot, I left my apartment on fire!"
13120,You can count on us Mr Mayor! Justice away!
13124,Not a problem. I've cleverly arranged to meet my parents right there at the same museum at 10.
13126,I can't believe the Zookeeper is this late for his own heist. It's just rude! Total hell! It's 10! I'm supposed to meet my parents and I'm still in my secret costume!  There they are!
13134,You're not stealing anything! Nobody hit the deck!
13145,Forget it Zookeeper! You're going into captivity!
13147,"No, Fry you can't fall fast enough!"
13152,Oh no! My parents are leaving! I've gotta go change back into street-Leela.
13155,Mom? Dad? I showed up! And I got the audio tour for Treasures Of Liberachi's Tomb!
13157,I wanna tell you why I didn't show up. But I can't. Just please believe me that it was a very good reason. I'm sorry I disappointed you.
13160,"Oh, I can't take it! Mom, Dad, I'm Clobberella!"
13164,"No, listen. It's very important that you never ever tell anyone. Under any circumstance."
13166,"Dad, you drink? No. Not even then."
13168,"In fact, I shouldn't even be wearing this around here.  It was brisk, I dressed in layers."
13177,"Uh Professor, isn't it time for your nap?"
13179,Zookeeper! How did you know our real identities?
13184,Mom! Dad!
13186,Are you alright? Has he hurt you?
13189,"Alright Zookeeper, what do you want?"
13191,We're out of options. We have to steal the Gemerald!
13195,Check inside the cap! There might be a caked in goldmine!
13198,Just be cool. Nobody knows we're superpowerly challenged.
13203,"Big O, little k my friend! Just checking if everything's alright!"
13205,OK then. Grab it!
13208,"Stay back! Or we'll, beat the tour out of you...using superpowers!"
13216,"Mom, Dad, oh I'm so sorry I got you kidnapped by a crazy madman who tried to feed you to pirhanas."
13218,"No no, it's my fault for telling you I was a superhero."
13220,I just couldn't stand to have you to think I was ashamed of you.
13225,
13235,"Uh, maybe I should drive."
13239,For heaven's gate Professor this ship can do 99% light speed. Why are we going at 35 miles an hour?
13241,Plus you have the highbeams on!
13252,Oh Lord! Teeth do not belong in your pants Professor.
13255,No! No! It's tasted human blood!
13257,Professor we've talked it over and everyone thinks you're too old.
13265,"OK OK, we're not gonna force you until I've finished this sentence. Get him!"
13293,"Hey, this my chance to spend time with my parents too!"
13295,"When I was an orphan I always wished I could grow up with my mom and dad. And now, thanks to being hurled backwards through time -"
13297,"It's gonna be totally awesome mom! You and me can bake and argue about my hairstyle hiding my pretty face. And if some kid picks on me, my dad can beat up his dad."
13300,"No! I want the real teen experience! Chores, curfew, the works!"
13302,Dad I'm underage!
13319,Hi Fry! I like your blazer.
13324,"Dad, you're being too leaneant again! I have to be back by 11."
13326,No I'm not!
13328,What are you on a diet?
13331,"Moose, Mandy, this is my friend Fry - from the surface!"
13334,"Hey come on, let's act like grown ups here! Wanna race?"
13337,A tapeworm!
13339,Yes we will. This sewer goes right under Planet Express and its's 9pm!
13341,All right!
13343,I'm too short to reach the handbrake!
13354,Thanks Professor but I don't want the treatment.
13357,My old life wasn't as glamourous as my webpage made it look. All I ever wanted was to grow up here. With you. Please?
13359,It is. I know it is.
13375,"OK, quiet time. I know, everyone pretend to THING TO CHECK your tongue and I'll read you a story."
13377,There. Todays story is from New Teen magazine. What would you rather hear about? Four legged Chachi or tentacled Chachi?
13379,"It's kind of a baby book. But OK. Let's see. Snow White Dwarf And The Seven Red Dwarves, Charlotte's Tholian Web, The Fountain Of Aging."
13384,"I wish I could come with you to say goodbye, before you all turn back in to grown ups but I'm grounded for knocking the school over."
13386,No! A grounded teenager must be confined to her room!
13387,...until she sneaks out!
13389,"According to this, the fountain is located within the darkest, most ancient region of space, just past teddybear junction."
13392,Look how high the asteroid belt is pulled up on that planet.
13394,"Dude, the Fountain Of Aging must be on the sun itself!"
13396,We've got to hurry. The kids have only one change of pants!
13401,Zoidberg is dead!
13404,Oh no!  Quick! Get them into the fountain!
13406,You can bother me a little.
13408,I'm coming in after you!
13411,I think I might be a couple years younger.
13413,He's too far out! We can't reach him!
13417,"Well, I guess ever adult wants to be a kid sometimes. But I worked hard to be the person I am!"
13419,With friends like you guys -
13421,And I'm really happy I have that life back.
13434,"Don't worry, everything went fine."
13436,We got medals! Good work team! We really pulled together on this one.
13447,Nope. I've got a date with Chaz.
13449,I met him at that charity cock fight last week. He's the mayor's aide.
13451,I do go! He's a very important man.
13463,"Wow, free bread at a restaurant? Is there anything you can't do?"
13466,"Hey, I hear Fry.  Boy am I glad you're here!"
13468,"Actually...they are! Confidentially, I might not make it back to my apartment tonight! Could you walk Nibbler for me?"
13470,And bring a baggy in case he drops a steamer. (shouting) Have a great night!
13476,Oh Chaz!
13593,I love rocket skating! But the wait is always so long. Fry once stood in line for six hours just to get me a ticket.
13595,You reserved the whole rink?
13597,Oh Chaz!
13600,"Aww, let's let those kids skate with us."
13602,"I know, and it's working. But think how much skating would mean to those kids."
13604,This may be their only chance to skate in their whole lives. Who are we to say they can't?
13646,"Bender, would you do the honours?"
13649,Oh. Thank you. You know what Fry. I don't care if you're not the most important person in the universe. It really makes me happy to see you right now.
13658,Why? Says who?
13662,We're just as good as any of those crews you sent to their deaths. What's the mission?
13664,That doesn't sound so dangerous.
13674,It'll take more than deadly deadly bees to keep us from doing our job. Come on boys!
13676,"Listen, I'm scared too. But I'm more scared of disappointing myself."
13678,Now bees communicate by dancing.
13680,So this language cartridge will let you distract them.
13682,Bender quick! Waggle something!
13686,"Relax, everything'll be fine!"
13688,There's the black box!
13691,"Uh, couldn't make that out. Too much static!"
13693,We found it! The honey comb hideout!
13695,Royal jelly. They feed it to the queen.
13697,Look!  It's a baby queen! Aww she's so cute! You adorable wittle itty bitty fuzzy wuzzy -
13699,I'm taking this bee with us. With queen we can build a hive and make more honey ourselves. Let me just pack her a lunch and we'll go.
13703,This is where we distinguish ourselves from the last crew. Activate emergency high speed self contained escape pack crisis response unit! Quick!
13704,Good luck Bender!
13707,Burn on that old crew! The only things they did better than us were suck and die!
13709,"Thanks, but I can look out for myself. Frankly I can smell danger a mile away."
13711,You call that a wound? That's a boo boo top! But thanks for trying to save me Fry! Fry?  He's...he's dead.
13729,Fry? I thought you were dead.
13731,Impressive! But it does sorta support my You-Are-Dead theory.
13733,It's too beautiful to open! Can I open it?
13735,What?
13737,Wake up? But I'm not -
13738,In my dream Fry said he hid a gift for me in my locker. If it's true then he must still exist in some form.
13740,"Well, here goes."
13743,Was there anything in there that might have been a gift for me?
13745,You took this from Fry's locker?
13747,That proves it. Fry is alive somewhere and he's reaching me in my dreams.
13750,Is this some sort of brain scanner?
13752,Professor! Can't you examine my brain without removing it?
13756,What is it? Is Fry alive in some other dimension or something?
13758,"But, my dream. Your science can't unprove that! How could I have know the gift was in Fry's locker?"
13760,Are you saying I'm going crazy?
13763,"Shut up, I can hear you. The Professor says you're just a dream."
13765,"Well yes, technically. It's still very sweet of you."
13767,Oh Fry you must be alive! I've never been treated so romantically by my own imagination before!
13769,Thank you. It's all so beautiful I forgot how many hundreds of degrees zero it must be. I just wish I could convince the others you're alive.
13771,No no! Don't say that! This is real!
13772,Not another dream!  Fry's jacket! The one he was buried in! My dream was real! He's alive!
13774,Fry's alive! I have proof!
13777,But he gave me his jacket. Look.
13779,But Fry...his jacket...and when I woke up it was on me.
13782,What?
13784,Oh. Maybe I am freaking out a little.
13786,I need to calm down. I'd better take some more of that space honey.
13790,"One spoonful to calm me down.  OK, I've got a pretty good calm going! Two spoonfuls to help me sleep.  Uh oh, still awake. I guess one more spoonful couldn't hurt. Oh my gosh! I'd better get a sponge! Fry?  Is that you? I don't need a sponge!"
13798,"Fry, I'm so glad I didn't kill you."
13800,Feeling responsible for your death was driving me mad. But now everything is alright.
13802,What? What do you mean?
13804,Wake up? Oh no! No! It can't be!
13805,Poo.
13806,"I'm cracking up. In my dreams I'm happy because Fry is alive, but when I'm awake my mind plays tricks on me."
13823,"Uh, were you just singing?"
13825,"I'll find Fry's coffin, take his corpse and keep it under my mattress to remind me he's really dead. That'll prove I'm not insane."
13826,"OK, it's just an ordinary coffin. Containing my ordinary dead friend, who I killed."
13827,What happened? Why am I in my apartment?
13828,Stop it! Stop it!
13830,"OK, I'm insane! But I'm still sane enough to know it.  The only time I feel alright is in my dreams. With you.  Three spoonfuls. Then I can dream forever.  One.  Two Here goes. Goodbye waking world."
13836,OK. I'll try.  Go away!
13842,Fry. You're alive!
13844,Of course I'm awake. You wouldn't stop waking me.  Where am I?
13846,But the bee stung you. It barely touched me.
13851,Really? How long was I out?
13855,It got through Fry.  It got through.
13859,"(shouting): Sorry I think I, um, I think I left my toaster on."
13876,Right! If they try to look in the box.
13886,That oughta keep those dopes occupied. I can guard the real box in peace now that no one's curious about it.
13887,"Well, I got through the night and no one looked in the box. Not even me. The person who gave up her whole evening to watch it. A whole evening of TV gone. What a mockery of justice it is that I can't take even a little tiny peek! I need coffee.  OK. Heads I look, tails I don't.  Oh yeah! Heads! I mean - alright then!  No. I have a duty not to look. But then again, I promised the coin I would.  Oh it's deep. Deeper than a small box should be."
13888,Ouch! My lawyer will hear about this!
13890,"Nothing. What do you mean ""why was I looking in the box?"""
13892,Bender? Is that you?
13895,I didn't dye my hair. This is how I always look.
13898,Hold it! You have this all wrong. I just fell into the box and then I fell out somehow.
13903,"No look, I am not evil. My loan officer said so."
13907,I tell you they're not evil. But don't be confused. They are jerks.
13913,Look. It doesn't matter who created what. The important thing is - yah!
13918,"This is getting confusing. Why don't we call our universe ""Universe A"" and this universe ""Universe B""?"
13928,That's weird. Mine came up heads so I did.
13940,You guys are dating?
13951,"So Fry, Leela, how'd you two get together?"
13957,Oh Lord!
13962,Woo!
13990,So we go through the box and stop Hermes?
14019,"Uh, have you robot versions of yourselves seen any extra Zoidbergs around here?"
14020,"Uh, access denied."
14040,"Well, I guess you deserve one more flip."
14042,"Y'know, lets just say it's heads."
14045,So what you think you just explain to us is that -
14048,"Bender, quit destroying the universe!"
14058,I'm going to swim with the whale! They're the gentle giants of the deep.
14067,No.
14071,What little there is to be had.
14104,I'd like a pass to swim with Mushu please.
14106,Then why'd you become a whale biologist?
14125,"Hmm, this may seem like a huge coincidence but I happen to have it in with that whale!"
14133,Pay dirt!  Heyya!
14150,Anything else?
14152,"OK Mushu, its feeding time!  Oh crud, he ate my suit!"
14208,It's on fire!
14213,I think we were saved by a mysterious orange blur.
14218,Me too!
14224,At least we got a few mildly interesting stories out of it.
14240,"Ugh, enough emotions! This isn't a fat camp for God sake. (quietly) Though you wouldn't know it from looking."
14274,"There's nothing so refreshing as the clean, crisp taste of old Canadian beer!"
14277,"Bender raises a good point, where is Fry?"
14282,Someone should tell him.
14284,Nothing.
14295,I know you're trying to mask your pain with humour but don't worry. I'm sure the Professor can clone you a new nose.
14305,Me and Bender and maybe Zoidberg if he feels like it.
14309,"Wait, what's that?"
14313,Of course not. In fact he's a crook.
14320,That's Lrrr! Ruler of the planet Omicron Persei 8!
14331,"Whoa, you guys have issues!"
14337,Hold still Fry. I can reattach it with my emergency face laser.
14339,Yeah sorry I wasn't really concentrating.
14362,Let's face it. You two have deep relationship problems that can't be solved by an aphrodisiac.
14365,"Well, why don't you think back to what brought you together in the first place?"
14373,"Yeah, we know a great place in the mountains. We could take you there for a romantic dinner under the stars."
14395,Don't worry Fry. Things look bad but I still have a trump card. The most beautiful love song ever written.  (singing badly) And I will always love you......will always love you...
14420,"Well Fry, it looks like you get to hold onto your lower horn."
14428,"No, they're from the Republic Of French Stereotypes. Everybody hates them."
14432,It does seem like Jamaica will be able to field a strong limbo team without you.
14470,You actually thought they'd let you walk away without an engine oil sex check?
14475,"No, you can't!"
14488,"I don't know which I'm more, enraged or disgusted!"
14514,Well I think you dating a Manbot is a disgrace. And I refuse to be involved. And you have way too much lipstick on.
14516,No they don't.
14524,I'm worried about him too Professor.
14542,What do you mean a scam?
14545,That is so unbelievably manipulative.
14547,Well I...uh...I thought I might like him on a full stomach.
14571,OK look. If I help you with this do you promise to get out of my gender and stay out?
14573,"Alright. Now there's no way to stop this marriage without hurting Calculon. But he's an actor. If there's one kind of pain he can handle, it's soap opera pain."
14574,"(whispering) OK, is everyone ready?"
14587,Coilette! You she-devil!  You really thought you could steal those diamonds from me and Congo Jack?
14609,I kind of hope this whole experience would have left you a little more open to your sensitive side.
14612,Aww!
14621,What did you say?
14628,Aww!
14663,Let's try him out. Robot 1-X? Can you clean Nibbler's skanky litterbox?
14666,I asked you five minutes ago.
14680,"Well, ask Robot 1-X to pull you out."
14682,Why can't you accept his help.
14684,But he's just a tool to make your life easier. Like a socket wrench or a burglars kit.
14688,"Oh, sorry."
14757,"Professor, we have no power."
14759,I'd better light some candles.
14761,Oh Lord he's made of wood! What now Bender?
14770,Great. Now we're being crushed.
14782,"Well, at least you saved us from, uh, you. Thank God you finally overcame your incompatibility with Robot 1-X."
14811,Do you two have to imitate everything you see on TV?
14833,Since when are you performing at children's parties?
14850,"Bender, your swarthy Latin charm will only get you so far. There's a lot of famous child acting units here."
14852,He's just not cute since he got puberty installed.
14854,And there's that robot child actor who grew up and became a convenience store!
14941,"As unclean as it makes me feel, I agree with Bender. Kids don't turn rotten just from watching TV."
15016,Yeah!
15027,(singing) ...Than watch TV and have a couple of brews!
15035,Blernsmen at Blernsball!
15059,"Hey guys, you missed a great delivery to Space Earth. Where you been all afternoon?"
15061,Ooo was it jazz-noodling? My ex-boyfriend Sean played the sax. I used to listen for hours while he sat naked on my couch and improvised.
15063,"Yeah, it's weird. Sean was uneducated, unambitious. He was pastey and hunched..."
15065,"...But when he played I could sense this incredible, beautiful creative soul. Then one day I found someone else's couch fibres on his butt."
15114,Me? Really?
15116,Is it part of the opera?
15118,But it's so beautiful.
15120,Oh Fry. All this time you've had this incredible gift and I never knew. I've been a fool. A fully justified prudent fool.  They're so cold.
15136,"Well, Fry's opera premiere's tomorrow night. I'm off to find a pair of formal gloves that'll fit over my enormous forearms."
15138,(shouting) What? Are you talking? Oh God I'm deaf!
15140,(shouting) What? Oh this is horrible. I won't be able to hear Fry's opera.
15145,"Nobody tell Fry I'm deaf. If he found out I couldn't hear his opera, it'd break his heart."
15148,Yay Fry!
15153,"Amy, Fry's looking at me. What am s'posed to be feeling?  Ah!"
15160,"Half over? Oh, I'd give anything to hear the rest."
15162,"What? You can give me new ears? Wait, what seemingly reasonable thing do you want in return?"
15164,"Whatever you said, forget it!"
15166,Just...my left hand? Um...uh...
15169,I can't stand it!  OK. You can have my hand.
15172,"I can hear! I can hear like a safecracker! Hey, aren't you gonna take my hand?"
15181,Whoa!
15183,"(singing) Fry, you do not understand."
15185,What?
15190,"(singing) That isn't what I meant,"
15192,(reading) I'll give you my hand...
15212,Please don't stop playing Fry. I wanna hear how it ends.
