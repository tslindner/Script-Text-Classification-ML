89,"I'm a bender. I bend girders, that's all I'm programmed to do."
91,"You kidding? I was a star! I could bend a girder to any angle: 30 degrees, 32 degrees, you name it! (unsure) 31. (normal) But I couldn't go on living once I found out what the girders were for."
93,"Suicide booths!  Well, Fry, it was a pleasure meeting you, I'm gonna go kill myself."
95,You really want a robot for a friend?
97,"Well, OK. But I don't want people thinking we're robo-sexuals, so if anyone asks, you're my debugger."
99,I'm not looking!
102,"We can hide in here, it's free on Tuesdays."
128,"Oh, we're trapped!"
130,"Dream on, skin tube. I'm only programmed to bend for constructive purposes. What do I look like, a de-bender?"

135,"You're full of crap, Fry!  You make a persuasive argument, Fry."
137,Can't...I...can't...do...it!

267,"Hey, rich girl. Look over here! It's me, Bender. I'm being entertaining. (singing) La la la look at my head. It's all painted look at my head! I got a big old head, hey! Ho! (talking) Alright, show's over, I'm tired."
270,"Nice catch, idiot!"

313,Idiots who need gifts for other idiots.
315,"Get it off! Get it off! Get it -- uh oh!  (singing) How many roads must a man walk down, before you... (talking) Keep those things off of me! Magnets screw up my inhibition unit!"
317,Yes. I guess a robot would have to be crazy to wanna be a folk singer.
320,"Oh, jeez, I went to high school with that guy!"
329,Yeah! You're the kind of guy who visits Jerusalem and doesn't want to see the Sexeteria!

372,"Yeah, well, I'm gonna go build my own theme park, with blackjack and hookers. In fact, forget the park!"
398,He'll never find me in here.
401,Of course not. A lady that fine you gotta romance first.
410,"What do you mean ""we"", mammal?"
417,"Oh, no room for Bender, huh? Fine! I'll go build my own lunar lander, with blackjack and hookers. In fact, forget the lunar lander and the blackjack. Ah, screw the whole thing."
428,Not the magnet! No! No! Nooo --  Uh-oh!
429,"(singing) She'll be comin' round the mountain when she comes,"
431,"(singing) She'll be riding six white horses when she comes,"

438,Hey!
448,"That's right, we want some money -- wait, what's this about Fry?"
462,"Fry, we've got to discuss your living arrangements."
464,"Hey, All My Circuits! Move over.  Ahh!"
473,"Yeah, would you kindly shut your noise hole?"
475,That's a human.
477,"Eh, the usual human stuff. He laughs, he learns, he loves."
483,"Cheer up, meatbag, you've barely touched your amoeba."
485,"Nah, I'm trying to watch my input. I need plenty of wholesome, nutritious alcohol.  The chemical energy keeps my fuel cells charged."
487,They make me look cool.
489,"Yeah, but everybody's a jerk. You, me, this jerk.  That's my philosophy. So, where you gonna stay?"
491,"Yeah, but the rents are outrageous. Why don't you just come move in with me?"
493,"Nah, I've always wanted a pet."
494,Here we are. Your new home.
496,"Come on in, I'll give you the tour!"
497,"Let's see, where to start. OK, this is the TV area, that over there's the breakfast nook, and over here is where you'll be living which is great because, until now, it's just been wasted space."
499,"Look, pal, you've only got one set of clothes and you're not taking them off while I'm here. Well, I'm bushed. G'night."
501,(sleep-talking) Kill all humans...kill all humans...must kill all the humans.
503,I was having the most wonderful dream. I think you were in it.
505,Bath what?
507,What room?
509,What what?
511,"(sleep-talking) Hey, sexy mama...wanna kill all the humans?"
513,"Yeah, this past week with Fry's been a blast! Y'know, beneath this warm, sunny exterior, beats the cold, mechanical heart of a robot."
520,"Hey, there's my little space heater."
522,What?!
524,Not enough room? My place is two cubic metres and we only take up 1.5 cubic metres. We've got room for a whole nother two-thirds of a person.
526,I don't know. I've got a lot of great memories in my old place.  And now they're gone.
529,What the?
539,What's with all the crap?
546,"Whoa, slow down! This place just doesn't feel like home. It just isn't...cosy. Ahh, I can barely move.   It's perfect!"
548,"Yeah! It's gonna be fun on the bun! Y'know Fry, of all the friends I've had, you're the first."
554,"Wow, heavy drinking crowd!  I'd better go out for more beer."
556,"I know, but I need alcohol to power up my batteries. If Calculon's wedding doesn't go just right I'll be emotionally and electrically drained."
568,Hey what happened to the TV?
570,This is an outrage! I'm gonna go yell at the manager!
575,What? That's the last straw!
578,Yeah! And you'd better get rid of whatever's causing it or we're outta this dump!
586,You people are nuts. My antenna never interfered with my old TV.
590,"Madam, I believe you're mistaken!"
591,"Wow, that lady's got a huge ass!"
592,"Those could be anyone's thoughts, fat ass!"
597,"Fine! Come on, Fry, let's move to that apartment that smelled like a sewer. You liked that one, right?"
599,Or we could live underground with the mutants. A little fire'll show 'em who's boss!
601,I don't understand.
603,"But, then we wouldn't be roommates."
607,"(downbeat) Happy. Yeah, that's Bender. Always happy."
624,It's so big and empty.
625,"My roommate's gone. And all he left behind was an eyelash and three skin flakes.  Oh, what's the point?!"
627,Leave me alone!
629,Hey. What I don't do is none of your business.
631,I hate the people who love me and they hate me.
633,Like how? Having my antenna removed?
635,Are you crazy? That's Little Bender you're talking about. I can't cut it off. You're not a robot or a man so you wouldn't understand. I gotta get out of here.
637,I promise nothing!
646,That's right! I'm sober and crazy and I don't know what I might do!
648,"I don't know what it is yet. Oh, yeah, now I remember. I thought I could live alone, but I can't. So, I'm gonna do what it takes to be your roommate again."
651,"No, I'm going to chop off my antenna."
655,I'm gonna do it! I'm really gonna do it! Don't try and stop me! Here goes.
663,"You're my best friend, Fry, I'm sorry I treated you so badly."
667,Nothing. I guess I'm just going to have to get used to being half a robot.
669,Maybe. If we get it on ice right away.
672,"This time, you'll have all the human comfort. We'll get a couple of toilets, some food cookers, maybe a puppy."
674,"It sure is. By the way, I saved your stuff."
676,There's a window in the closet.
678,"In a closet? Oh, humans!"
692,That sounds like a cry for help.
695,A saucy puppet show.
708,"Forget it, he's gay."
710,I just know these things. I've got what they call gaydar.
712,"No?  OK, I got a lock on him.  Yep! He's gay!"
714,Definitely. Unless I'm getting interference from a gay weather balloon.
721,(whispering) I think she means 10 wins on the gay circuit.
727,Just as well; I think he comes from a dimension that's big on musical theatre.
729,Can do!
731,"So, Leela, you must have had your pick of the litter last night at closing time."
749,Why two?  Oh!
751,"That'll take forever. What she oughta do is find a nice guy with two eyes, then poke one out."
754,Here you go.  You can use this as an eye-poker.
771,"A grim day for robot-kind. Ah, but we can always build more Killbots!"
775,Well just in case you guys hit it off you'll wanna take this with you.
806,He's throwing us in prison.
809,You really are too picky.
839,"Hey, yeah!"
858,"Nah, I'm comfy."
882,So should we get our stuff and head down to the planet?
886,So you're saying we can cook him?
889,Aww! (whispering to Fry) I'll fire up the grill!
894,I found a pair of Hermaphlamingoes.
896,Hey. What the?
900,He's pending for a bending.
904,"Yeah, I'll do it when we get back."
909,"So what's your problem? It's not like you slept with him.  Oh, my God!"
932,Can do!
933,What the hell was that?
936,So this guy just unloaded a steaming pile of starship fuel?
939,So a couple of animals didn't die and Leela got lucky. That's what I call a successful mission!
950,"Hey, nice seats! We're close enough to when you knock a player down with a beer bottle, he stays down."
959,"I got me a souvenir!  Aww, here you go, kid!"
966,"Hey, buddies, who wants popcorn?"
970,Anyone want butter on that?
976,"Clem Johnson? That skin bag wouldn't have lasted one pitch in the old Robot Leagues! Now Wireless Joe Jackson, there was a blern hitting machine!"
978,"Oh, and I suppose Pitchomat 5000 was just a modified howitzer?"
980,You humans are so scared of a little robot competition you won't even let us on the field.
982,"Yeah, doing crap work! They're bat boys, ball polishers, sprinkler systems. But how many robot managers are there?"
984,Zero!  And what a surprise! Look who's scraping up the filth. Is it a human child? I wish!
991,Admit it: You all think robots are just machines built by humans to make their lives easier.
993,I've never made anyone's life easier and you know it!
997,"Oh, so just 'cause a robot wants to kill humans that makes him a ""radical""?"
1001,"Oh, I get it, make the robot do all the work!"
1003,Well I'm not doing it! It's a robot holiday.
1005,Only Robanukah. The holiest two weeks on the robot calendar.
1008,It wasn't just a blast. It was a sacred tribute to my ancestral prototypes which happened to take the form of a drinking contest.
1010,"Alright, I'll go. But so help me, I'll hold a grudge against every last stinking one of you for the rest of your lives."
1013,No. It's inhabited by robots!
1016,"Yes, Miss Leela. Tote that space barge, lift that space pale."
1018,(ironic) I'll try to keep that in mind!
1024,"I'm in trouble. They found out I work with humans and -- oh, no! Oh, no!"
1094,Death to humans!
1096,"Many said I was too extreme when I first called for the annihilation of the human species, as well as some of the more cunning monkeys. But after living on Earth I can tell you that I am, if anything, too merciful!"
1098,"Thank you! Thank you! And if you enjoyed that diatribe then you'll want to purchase my spoken word album, just 18.95! Act now and you'll get this Bender action figurine."
1102,"Now, your basic human is between three- and 25-feet tall and is made of a hairy, oily goo wrapped in a t-shirt."
1104,"Sure, why not?"
1106,Nothing. Today's active humans prefer a low-calorie bait.
1108,Wait! What's that?
1110,"Hmm, sounds like a breeding ground for humans. I'd better check it out."
1111,"Oh, yeah! You're a bad girl, aren't you?"
1113,Huh? Wha? You! What the hell are you doing here?
1115,I was. But they let me go when I told them I killed a million billion humans.
1117,What for?
1119,I don't wanna be rescued.
1121,"I love this planet. I've got wealth, fame and access to the depths of sleaze that those things bring."
1123,Friends? That activates my hilarity unit! I'm just a machine to you. You're no more friends with me than you are with the toaster or the phonograph or the electric chair.
1125,Well that's how it feels to me.
1127,"Go on, get out of here before you get caught."
1131,Uh...got you...you murderous flesh piles!
1157,"Alright, let's make this quick, I'm due at the opening of a mini-mall. Hey! What is this?"
1164,"Uh, I'm a little tired right now. Would it be alright if I just gave 'em a savage beating?"
1168,"Aww!  I can't kill them. Plenty of humans have mistreated robots but not these two. They're my friends. Humans are no threat to us. They're stupid, putrid cowards."
1170,"The fact is, humans are completely harmless."
1172,You are?
1178,"Well, I'm glad we got all that out in the open. We'll just let ourselves out."
1188,"Hey, hold on a second, I forgot to deliver the package."
1191,"Wow, I can't believe you guys did all this for me! This is the best Robanukah ever!"
1193,"Aww, thanks! You do know that I made Robanukah up to get out of work, right?"
1196,"In that case, let the dancing begin! Hey, you guys are good. How the hell do you do that?"
1215,"Quit squawking, flesh wad, nobody's forcing you to buy anything."
1220,No thanks I --
1226,New? What sweater? I came in with it. I don't know you people!
1241,"Mmm, tasty!"
1245,I'm boned.
1247,"Uh, there's obviously been some sort of a mistake here.  I'm sure there's......I say I'm sure there's......that is, I'm sure there's...a very...reasonable..."
1262,"Maybe you don't understand just how rich he is. In fact, I think I'd better put on a monocle."
1276,Maybe you're forgetting just how rich you are.  Huh? Huh?
1279,Hey! Get a load of this pathetic 20th century TV!
1281,"Well, aside from causing eye cancer, these things had a lousy low-definition picture."
1288,"Ah, leave him alone, Leela. So he's going a little wacko with his money. It's OK."
1290,"Yeah, it is cute."
1332,Yeah. Now are you gonna come to the squid fights with us or sit here wallowing in your prehistoric junk?
1406,We thought you only cared about cans of anchovies and stuffy old songs about the buttocks.
1409,Wheee!
1421,Who did?
1438,(singing) Going through the 'bot wash!
1439,(singing) Goin' through the robot wash!
1440,Ah!  Aww!
1443,"Uh, nothing!"
1445,"No, of course not! It was...uh...porno! Yeah that's it!"
1447,"(ashamed) Oh, it's true! I've been hiding it for so long."
1452,You call that a couch? I demand a pillow!
1454,Hmm.
1456,Yeah! We're gonna kick it up a notch. Bam!
1458,"Honey, I wouldn't talk about taste if I was wearing a lime green tank top."
1461,Yep. Every chef knows that this is the place to get exotic gourmet ingredients.
1477,"Hey, buddy. I'm looking for fresh slug."
1478,Whatever.
1479,"Yeah, yeah, either one's fine."
1487,(shouting) Thank you!
1491,"Uh-oh, I don't like the sound of that."
1493,Here it comes.
1495,"Thank you, and goodnight."
1501,Almost ready!
1502,Now for a dash of salt!  Uh-oh!
1509,It's salt with water in it if that's what you mean.
1511,There was nothing wrong with that food. The salt level was 10% less than a lethal dose.
1533,"You know, Fry, I've often thought about becoming a Prime Minister."
1535,"Yes! In your face, Gorgak!"
1538,"Stay the course, pal!"
1588,"Hey, look. The suns are setting. I can finally switch to hard liquor!"
1589,"Check out the glowing freaks. It's beautiful! Hey, what's that?"
1594,"Shut up, you!"
1603,"Hey, why don't you just sweat him out?"
1613,"I'll make you cry, buddy!  You're a pimple on society's ass and you'll never amount to anything."
1615,Good point. But here's a disturbing reminder: Everyone you knew or loved in the 20th century is dead.
1617,"OK, Fry, grab a Kleenex for this one, 'cause there's no God and your idiotic human ideals are laughable!"
1619,"Man, I guess it's harder than I thought to make someone cry."
1621,"Up yours, bimbo!"
1623,"Cram it, lobster!  That is a good idea. I'll go call her."
1627,I'm not giving my name to a machine.
1629,Fry's in trouble...
1630,"...and he needs help. Now, I don't like you and you don't like me."
1632,You do? Look are you going to help or not?
1634,"Wait, wait, wait, wait.  What is it you like best about me?"
1636,I'm not sure. But I do know that she likes my in-your-face attitude.
1641,Wait a second. Here comes Leela.
1644,You do? Hmm.
1646,"I don't know. Perhaps I'll look out this window. Oh, dear God in heaven, they're swarming all over her."
1649,"They're strapping her to juicer. Oh, they're putting some ice cubes in the glass under it."
1651,"It can and, for all you know, it is. I'm sorry, Fry. She's dead."
1656,I told Fry you were dead so he would cry out the Emperor but you had to go and wreck it by surviving.
1672,Hey! Save some for me!
1680,Sounds boring.
1685,Ooh! Dibs on his CD player!
1700,"I've been perusing your fortified wine list and I've selected the '71 Hobo's Delight, the '57 Chateau Par-tay and the '66 Thunder Chevitz."
1702,And mix them all together in a big jug.
1704,(shouting) More wine!
1725,Yep!
1740,"Ooh, ooh, name it after me!"
1743,"Well, lets get looting!"
1755,Yeah! And this beer can is made outta old robots.
1787,"Oh, crap!"
1789,"(ironic) Oh, boo-hoo!"
1799,OK  (à la Homer Simpson) Mmm! Shorts!
1804,There's your problem. The Professor put the counter on upside-down.
1807,Right!
1808,It's gonna blow!
1810,"OK, OK, keep your space pants on. I'll take care of this."
1864,Can I get anybody a beer?
1869,I believe that qualifies as ill. At least from a technical standpoint.
1882,"Hey, Fender! Man, I haven't seen you since high school. You still workin' at Jack In The Box?"
1891,Count me in! I'm gonna drink til I reboot!
1892,"Hey, what kinda party is this? There's no booze and only one hooker."
1894,"Uh hey, I'm no square but isn't that counter-indicated by my operations manual?"
1897,"Well, if jacking on'll make strangers think I'm cool, I'll do it!"
1899,"Eh, no need to worry. I don't have an addictive personality."
1901,"Shut up, square!  I'll just be a minute!"
1903,Hey! Do I preach to you when you're lying stoned in the gutter? No! So beat it!
1905,Yo mama! Now shut up and drag me to work!
1909,"None of your business, get off my back!"
1914,No! Don't come in!
1916,"Alright, let's get to work! I'll be out in a second."
1920,None of your business! Get off my back!
1922,A what kind of disturbance?
1926,"Come on universe you big, mostly empty wuss! Gimmie all the juice you got! Oh, mama!"
1927,What?
1932,You're right. I'm a lost cause.
1933,Maybe there's another way.
1934,"Oh, yeah, that's the good stuff.  (crying) What am I doing? What have I become? Huh?"
1940,(weakly) Me.
1943,"(singing) Oh, what a beautiful morning, oh what a beautiful day! (talking) Greetings, friends. Don't we all look nice today?"
1945,"No, I'm whacked out on life. My friends, I found religion."
1952,"Wonderful. Then you'll all come to my exceedingly long, un-air-conditioned baptism ceremony!"
1957,"Yes, I do."
1959,"Uh, while you're at it, could you touch up this seam?"
1961,The old Bender's gone. He won't trouble you anymore.
1963,"No poison for us, thanks. I'll stick with good old mineral oil.  Ah! Functional!"
1965,Friends! Friends! Surely you're not going to eat before we say Robot Grace? In the name of all that is good and logical we give thanks for the chemical energy we are about to absorb. To quote the prophet Jerimatic: 1000101010101...
1966,...0010110012. Amen.
1968,"Yes.  But first, since I love you all so much, I'd like to give everyone hugs. Come here, Fry!"
1970,"Mmm! Mmm! Fry, you're my friend!  C'mon, everyone line up for a hug. Let's tear down some emotional walls."
1972,Sanctifying it!  There! That ought to convert a few tailgaters.
1978,I can't believe somebody hired an interstellar spaceship to deliver a package to Atlantic City. What are we delivering anyway?
1980,Where are we delivering it to?
1982,Another job well done. Now back to the office for an enjoyable evening of fasting and repentance.
1985,"But, those girls don't wear cases. You can see their bare circuits."
1987,"What?"" Drinking wine is a sin. Even if it is deliciously fortified."
1989,Thou shalt not snatch.
1992,Stop tempting me! For once in my life I have inner peace.
1998,Well...
1999,I'm the greatest.  Woo-hoo!
2001,"You know it, pork pie! Except for one thing."
2002,"Y'know, as a major Hollywood director I'll be holding auditions tonight for my next movie. And even though you're all young and naive, I think you might just have what it takes.  Hey! I'm trying to score here! Can't you read the ""Do Not Disturb"" sign?  No! No!"
2006,"I'm hallucinating this, right?"
2008,But I don't belong here. I don't like things that are scary and painful.
2010,"Aww, hell - I mean heck!"
2018,"Aw crap, singing. Mind if I smoke?"
2021,(singing) Just tell me why.
2023,(singing) There must be robots worse than I.
2025,"(singing) Then please let me explain,"
2027,"(singing) Ah, don't blame me blame my upbringing!"
2040,No! Oh they're tormenting me with up-tempo singing and dancing.
2053,"Well, we're boned."
2059,I could if you'd drop the stupid gold violin!
2061,"Don't worry, guys, I'll never be too good or too evil again. From now on, I'll just be me."
2063,I don't know. Do you think you could survive a 700ft fall?
2071,"Me neither. (upbeat) Food was good, though."
2073,Shove it! We quit!
2076,Alright!
2079,"Aww, you!"
2087,Was that before or after you slept with him?
2093,"Come on, where is it?  Ohh!"
2100,"Well, I'm tired of this room and everyone in it. If you'll excuse me, I'm gonna pop over to the casino for the next 135 hours!"
2106,"Hmm.  I'm bettin' it all!  Come on, baby needs a new pair of feet!"
2108,No! My cheating unit malfunctioned! You gotta give me a do-over!
2110,"Gimmie you're biggest, strongest, cheapest drink."
2112,Allow me to introduce myself. I'm Bender.
2114,"I assure you, I barely know the meaning of the word ""labour""."
2116,"Please, call me Bender."
2153,I was just about to suggest the same thing.  Pay dirt!
2155,Yeah. But only 93% as lovely as you.
2157,"I don't get it, iZac: That bracelet had a diamond the size of a racoon's brain. Why couldn't I steal it?"
2159,"Oh, it's true. But we're star-crossed robots. She, a countess built with a silver spoon in her mouth. And me, just a regular honest Joe."
2161,"Hell, no!"
2163,"Fellas, please. I'm in love!"
2188,"Well, now you know. I'm not actually rich. I'm a fraud. A poor, lazy, sexy fraud. This isn't even a real bow-tie -- it's magnetic."
2190,You do? Really?
2235,"You all go without me. I'm gonna take one last look around. You know, for, uh, stuff to steal."
2237,"(whispering) Alright, I am. But I don't want the others to know. If I don't come back, just say I died robbing some old man."
2239,"I love you, buddy!"
2240,(shouting) Countess? Countess?
2242,"(shouting) Are you hurt, my sweet?"
2244,Just hang on! I'll take care of that fire!
2246,"And I'd do it again. And perhaps a third time. But that would be it.  When we kiss, I feel like I'm standing waist deep in a pool of cold, rising water."
2262,Wait a second. Aren't you a member of the yacht club?
2277,(shouting) Wait for us!
2282,"I can't live without you. If you let go, I let go!"
2284,Don't talk like that. Tragic romances always have a happy ending.
2286,Nooo!
2287,She's gone.
2291,At least I'll always have her bracelet! What do you think it's worth?
2298,Another job well done.
2310,Hey look. There's a chapter of my old robot fraternity; Epsilon Rho Rho.
2312,"Of course, I'm a bender. I went to Bending College. I majored in Bending."
2314,Robo-American Studies.
2316,"Uh, no, actually I'm an Epsilon from way back."
2318,Thanks. Here's your finger back.
2319,All the coolest robots are in this fraternity.
2322,"Uh-oh, nerds!"
2324,You're all losers. My name's Bender.
2327,"(modest) Yeah, well, a lot of 'em were children. Anyway I should get going."
2329,"Hmm, OK. But I'll need 10 kegs of beer, a continuous tape of Louie Louie and a regulation two-storey panty-raid ladder."
2350,Bingo!
2352,"Oh, yeah! Someone's been a bad computer! Get a load of that!"
2355,Cheese it!
2391,"Hey, dean, nice looking model."
2393,"Now, I can explain that."
2395,No fair!
2400,Cheese it!
2427,"Well, looks like the party's winding down. Let's take a road trip to Tijuana and get Fatbot some action."
2464,"Oh, yeah? Watch this!"
2467,Hey!
2482,(shouting) Not as sure as I was an hour ago!
2505,"(shouting) Come on, everyone! Big party in Robot House!"
2525,Ow!
2531,"Aw, yeah!"
2542,Truly a great man. Look at him up there.
2544,"OK, now you go hide.  Nice knowin' you."
2547,"OK, everyone, come and get it!"
2549,"Bite my red-hot glowing ass.  Wait a minute. Red-hot glowing ass?  (calmly) I'll be right back!  Ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow!  Aw, yeah!"
2563,"Alright, alright, I'll bust you out. Cheese it!"
2567,"Right here, buddy.  Wait, I wanna be in the picture too.  Pretend you're happy."
2580,"Hey, look, Leela, it's that idiotic windbag you slept with."
2582,Evidently not.
2585,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on. I refuse to fight. I'm a conscientious objector."
2587,"You know, a coward."
2589,"It is every robot's duty to give his life for the good of humanity.  Oh, crap!"
2591,"Well actually I--  Sir, yes sir! Sir!"
2602,"Sir, I volunteer for a suicide mission. Aw, cut it out!"
2610,"The auxiliary power's out, and they spilled my cocktail."
2613,"(sadly) Yeah, but it'll never bring back my martini.  (normal) Well, who wants a martini?"
2643,"Well if they're hoping to see a TV show that hasn't existed for a thousand years, pfft, they are royally boned."
2652,They must just wanna see that episode. Let's find a tape and give it to 'em.
2658,"(dramatically) And I, I could be an acting coach!"
2668,(singing) ...And being self-reliant.
2686,We'll be back after this word from Crazy Bender's Discount Stereo.
2692,"(à la Arnold Jackson) Whatchoo talkin' 'bout, Fry?"
2702,"(singing) Single Female Lawyer,"
2706,"You did it, Fry!"
2718,Look at that worm go. Who says there are no more heroes?
2728,I'm sick.
2737,My tummy hurts and I've been having this burning electrical discharge.
2740,I'm 40% zinc.
2747,"I was wondering where I put that.  Hey, now I feel much better! Thanks, Professor. And, Amy, I'm sorry I took your watch."
2749,What should we point it at first?
2751,"Wow, neat! Mind if I try that again?"
2753,"Whoa, mama! Hold still, sexy lady."
2755,That's no lady!
2757,"Hey, bite my shiny metal ass!"
2760,"Huh, w-what? I didn't hear you. I was too busy using this F-ray to look inside of things."
2762,"Ah, this thing stinks."
2765,"You did it, Fry! You found the winning bottle-cap! We won!"
2768,Hey!
2773,"Wow! The original party worm!  Are you ready to get down, get funky with us?"
2782,Look! Flowers! And a boat!
2791,"(whispering) Psst, those berries. Those are the secret ingredient, right?"
2793,You positive?
2795,I'm just asking cause they look kind of secret.
2820,"OK, OK, we get the point."
2823,(shouting) Shut the hell up!
2831,Everybody was doing it. I just wanted to be popular.
2832,Ow!
2834,And why is the Slurm pouring into this sewer?
2853,"Oh, Lordy!"
2858,"I'll save us!  Oh, that feels good!"
2861,"Uh, your majesty, I brought the prisoners."
2871,"Look, we just came to party with Slurms MacKenzie. By the way, when is that scheduled?"
2874,"Ah, this trip is turning into a big letdown."
2887,I can't see what's happening. Are we boned?
2891,What's happening?  Just in time!
2895,Slurms MacKenzie?
2899,Forget it pal.  It says on this bottle-cap you have to party with us.
2901,"No can do, Slurms!"
2911,"Party on, Slurms!"
2921,"Yeah, that Slurms sure loved to party. Whattya say we all party one last time for him?"
2924,(simultaneously) For Slurms!
2928,"Hey, that's not that bad."
2935,"(shouting) Ow, my head! My precious head!  (talking) Stupid can opener. You killed my father and now you've come back for me!"
2937,"Yeah, I guess so. But I don't see why we keep this ticking time-bomb around just for that dumb animal."
2939,No.
2941,I'll pet him. I'll pet him with both hands!  Ow! My ass! Get off!
2943,"Ah, it's nothing a lawsuit won't cure."
2945,"Hey, I got a busted ass here, I don't see anyone kissing it."
2949,"What's that you say there, doctor? You're gonna have to put him down?"
2951,Terrible shame that. Shall I do the honours?
2953,You about done?
2962,(sarcastic) I'd be cuddly too if someone gave me a new cape.
2964,"Ooh, me! Everyone watch how good I am. And the crowd goes wild! What prize do I get? Cash?"
2968,You call that talent? Gather round old Bender and get ready for the show of a lifetime.  Ta-da!
2973,"Hey, what about this?"
2975,"Fine, we'll have rack of Nibbler."
2977,"So it's a cake you want, is it? I'll make you a cake you'll never forget."
2978,"That'll take care of those annoying rats.  Now, to bake a cake so delicious they'll have no choice but to love and worship me."
2979,There! This'll teach those filthy bastards who's lovable. Now all I have to do is spell check it and it's ready for my admiring public.  No! Get away from there!  That's it.
2980,Happy birthday!
2982,Hey! Can't you see I'm using the toilet?
2984,"Well, step one, I had to lift the seat. That was the first little annoyance. Am I right, men?"
2986,Only one way to find out.
2988,Of course I do. Right now I feel sorry for you.
2990,"Yeah. I mean, one cantaloupe-sized bloodshot eye? You ain't winning no beauty pageants, lady."
2995,"Bet you weren't expecting that one, Calculon!"
3001,"Hey, what the hell are you doing with my head?"
3003,Why don't you just use a potted plant like Fry?
3007,Ooh! Ow! Son of a-- Careful with that! Ow ...
3009,... Ow! Professor!
3011,Ow!
3013,"My God, I'm overcome with ... feelings. I'm experiencing a powerful yearning to ... to cram my gullet full of mackerel heads."
3016,"Now I'm worried that I'm not as smart as Leela, but at the same time I feel relieved that I'm cuter than her."
3019,This time I miss Nibbler and I'm feeling nosy and opinionated.
3023,Happy. I like this feeling. Just don't revert to your usual mopey self.
3025,"Anger, huh? How dare you make me feel anger, you one-eyed jerk with a dead pet!"
3030,(crying) I miss Nibbler.
3032,"Hell, no! It's Leela's stupid feelings. Why can't she just drink herself happy like a normal person?"
3033,"Uh-oh, jealousy.  (shouting) You think you're so hot!"
3035,The only reason you get all the guys is because you dress like a tramp!
3039,(crying) I'm so lonely. I'm gonna go eat a bucket of ice cream.  (crying) A bucket of ...
3041,"I'm at the end of my rope. I can't live another minute without poor, sweet Nibbler."
3043,Really?
3045,"Hmm, sewers.  Thinking, thinking, thinking."
3046,"Hang on, Nibbler. Uncle Bender's coming to save you.  Damn, it's too small. What did those human design this for anyway?  Aha! Bender, one; toilet, zero! See you on the other side!"
3066,I never should have thrown out the manual.
3068,I know. But I just missed Nibbler so much.
3070,(crying) He was so sweet.
3073,(shouting) Nibbler?
3077,(simultaneously) Idiot.
3091,"You guys realise you live in a sewer, right?"
3096,Eh.
3099,Nothing but crumpled porno and Ayn Rand.
3104,"(shouting) Come to Daddy, sweetie-ookums."
3107,Then what are those?
3118,"Hey, yeah!"
3125,"Oh, I made myself feel bad."
3131,"Nibbler! Aw, come here precious!  Look everyone, it's El Chupanibre."
3133,Say what?
3137,I'm too scared.
3143,"Listen to me, Leela: I'm an expert at not caring. The secret is to stop giving a rat's ass about anyone else and start thinking of the things that you want, that you deserve, that the world owes you."
3145,Bigger! Bigger!
3147,"Don't stop now, you'll need some pants to go with that outfit."
3149,"Bender is back. I'll save you, Nibbler."
3155,No thanks.
3159,I love you too.  Get that stupid chip out of me before I kill myself!
3163,"And I still barely felt anything. Goodnight, losers!"
3169,"Hmm. Get him, boys!"
3172,Nope. Watching cartoons.
3194,(whispering) He means you guys did it.
3250,Yeah?
3253,"Yeah, Fry already wiped off some of the dirt with his finger."
3268,I'm Bender. You know? The lovable rascal.
3272,And mean.
3276,"Hey, this guy's alright!"
3284,They're not very heavy but you don't hear me not complaining.
3288,"Hey, here's an idea, let's deliver all the pillows at once."
3292,Uh-oh.
3294,"Some breaking occured, the dolly was involved, that's about all we know."
3297,I'll start loading up the pillows.
3301,"(mocking) I'm Leela, get to work, neh neh neh."
3307,This is all Leela's fault.
3312,Beer?
3316,"You're outta here, lady. Zapp's the new captain."
3324,"You got it, genius."
3329,"Don't worry, Leela, soon we'll be able to look back on this and laugh."
3333,To the ends of the universe.
3336,"Yes, sir, sir!"
3344,"Nailed you, buddy!"
3348,"Yes sir, sirdy-sir-sir-sir!"
3352,"What now, chief?"
3364,"Leela save me ... and yourself, I guess ... and my banjo.  And Fry."
3368,As your God is my witness.
3370,"Oh, man, that crap's heavy."
3375,"Honey, unless we hit a time warp, I wouldn't worry about it."
3377,Quick.
3390,"Yeah, you're one dynamite lady. Can we have a week off?"
3393,"Come on, Captain."
3402,Cursed by his own hubris!
3404,"Hey, that's what Fry said when we turned on the debate!"
3420,"Ah, yes. John Quincy Adding Machine. He struck a cord with the voters when he pledged not to go on a killing spree."
3432,I'm not allowed to vote.
3434,"No, convicted felon."
3459,What? Lord have mercy!
3463,Alright! I'm rich!
3465,My body's 40% titanium!  I'm finally richer than those snooty ATM machines.
3467,"(ironic) Oh, can't I?"
3469,"Watch me, poor man."
3471,"Game's over, losers. I have all the money! Compare your lives to mine and then kill yourselves!  Hey, get away. Shoo! I'll give you five dollars to not do what you're thinking about doing. You just lost five dollars!"
3472,"Hey, buddy. Little help?  (shouting) Thank you!"
3473,"Hello, peasants."
3476,"No, I sold my body."
3479,Pft. Bodies are for hookers and fat people! All I need is a wad of cash with a head wrapped around it.
3481,"Yeah, right. What's he gonna do, break my legs?"
3482,"Ah, this is the life. Another martini, please."
3483,"Shaken, not stirred.  Aw, yeah!"
3484,Put it all on black.
3486,Yes! The rich get richer!
3487,"Strike! In your face, Leela!  Ow!"
3488,(shouting) Timber!
3490,"Maybe if you clean up first. It looks like your neck stepped in something. Oh, I'm sorry, that's just your body!"
3492,"I've had it up to here with this place. I'm off to the Head Museum to hang out with classy heads like me who appreciate the finer things: poetry, philosophy, hats. So long, coffin stuffers.  Uh, could one of you coffin stuffers please carry me?"
3493,"Now, which group of heads is good enough for me to hang out with? What do you think, Fry? Fry?"
3500,"Ah, US presidents.  Sturdy shelves, good security.  This place has class."
3506,"So then the hookerbot says, ""That's not my expansion slot"" and my friends says, ""That's not my gold-plated 25-pin connector!"""
3508,"You know, I like it here. What's the rent on one of these jars?"
3512,Pass.
3514,I hocked it.
3516,Same reason you hocked your teeth.
3521,"So, Nixon. Even if you miss your body, being a head's great too, right?"
3523,"Oh, great. Now you tell me!"
3525,"(sleep-talking) Ones...zeros...one, one, zero, zero, one --"
3527,"Whoa, what an awful dream. Ones and zeros everywhere. And I thought I saw a two."
3529,"I know what this is about. My body loved me, and I turned its back on it. Well, old friend, tie a yellow ribbon round your neck, 'cause I'm a-comin' home!"
3530,You sold my body? To who?!
3534,(crying) Oh! How could I let this happen? I can't go through the rest of my life like this.
3536,"(crying) Yeah, but it's on my body. What am I gonna do?"
3542,Oh!
3544,"That dirty, double-crossing bastard! How dare he run off with Richard Nixon!"
3548,"Yeah you are, you stole my body! Fry, Leela, you gotta help me!"
3554,"Great. First he steals my body, now he's touching my stuff."
3565,Give me my body back you two-bit thief!
3568,That was a good one!
3570,(crying) It's hopeless. We might as well turn in my head for the five cent deposit.
3576,"Whoa, mama! Get a room, you two!"
3578,Well then lose some weight.
3581,(whispering) Psst! There I am!
3586,I'm just here for what's mine. Don't make me kick your neck.
3594,"Not so fast, Nixon! Are you familiar with audio tape?"
3601,"Ah, it's good to be back in one piece again. Except I can't get these damn bumper stickers off."
3608,Get out of town!
3613,"Well it ain't my fault. I'm a non-voting felon, thank you."
3623,No. they fixed that 900 years ago.
3625,I doubt it!
3627,Eh.
3629,"Ah, lets face it: Comedy's a dead art form. Now tragedy ...  ... That's funny!"
3637,"Enough of your mindless chitchat, let's get going."
3648,"Lookin' good, meatball!"
3650,Lick my frozen metal ass.  Uh-oh!
3661,Ah! Nothing like a warm fire and a Super Soaker of fine cognac.
3681,Yes! I got the most! I win Xmas!
3683,"Hmm.  Ah, a picture of my mommy."
3689,"(upbeat) Hey, buddy, heard you needed cheering up! Well old Bender'll make you laugh.  Look at me look!  Oh, man, I gotta work on my act!"
3696,Xmas Eve; Another day where I accomplish nothing.
3701,To volunteer at a liquor kitchen for homeless robots.
3703,I'm very generous. What about that time I gave blood?
3705,Some guy's.
3721,"Yeah, yeah, amen. Listen, I'm one of those lazy homeless bums I've been hearing about. Could you point me to the free booze.  Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!"
3728,"Oh, yeah! You filthy hobos sure kow how to live.  Hey, chief, someone's stealing your handkerchief full of crap."
3732,My God! That poor kid!
3768,"Whoa, hold on! How about inviting us in for a traditional glass of hard cider?"
3770,(from inside) Get her purse!
3779,(singing) On the 4th day of Xmas I stole from that lady.
3783,(singing) And a slipper on a shoe tree.
3788,"No, wait, I know these guys. They got nothing."
3790,What? Me? I didn't do nothing. You're thinking of the kid.
3798,(shouting; from outside) Help!
3802,Use teamwork!
3807,"Yeah? Well I don't believe in Santa Claus. Come on, everybody, if you don't believe in him he can't hurt you.  Ow! God! The pain!"
3814,"Xmas dinner, everyone."
3816,"I found it lying in the street, like all the food I cook. Dig in, everyone."
3818,You got the toenail!  Oh!
3837,"Aw, jeez. Let's just pray I have the energy to get myself another beer. Oh, what is this? The Middle Ages?"
3860,"Hey, looks like Zoidberg's finally coming out of his shell.  Get it?  He's coming out--"
3868,It's always so sad when a friend goes crazy and you have to have a big clam-bake and cook him! Yee-haw!
3874,Moron!
3882,I'll get the water boiling!
3888,(from inside) Moron!
3894,"You're looking less nuts, crabby."
3903,"Look! Outdoor theatre! Let's get tickets. Oh, let's do!"
3908,Like whale barf.
3914,"Please, he's no different from the rest of you organisms; Shooting DNA at each other make babies. I find it offensive."
3923,"'Cause he's a loser, that's why. He's the lobster equivalent of Fry."
3969,So I returned his artificial heart and ever since then I've been known by the name of Honest Bender.
3973,Oy.
4009,"Fate is cruel and unyielding and what must be must be. (shouting) Takin' all bets! I'm giving 9-2 on Zoidberg, the crab with the jab! The Great Red Hope, come on baby!"
4020,"Fry, I've never asked you for anything before but if it's not too much trouble, when it comes to the ninth round just let him win."
4022,"Oh, so this is suddenly all about you. Sheesh!"
4027,Ow!
4032,"Psst, Fry. Take a dive."
4040,"Oh, my God!"
4048,Shoo! Get away! Hey! What's with the flying jerks?
4057,Yeah!
4070,Mind if I tag along? I gotta bring my ass in for servicing.  The recall notice says it could burst into flames in a low-speed collision.
4090,"You, sir, have defaced a national treasure! I demand you restore my buttocks to their former glory."
4132,What?
4136,"Congratulations, Fry, you snagged the perfect girlfriend. Amy's rich, she's probably got other characteristics."
4138,"Oh, so it's just coincidence that Zoidberg here is desperately poor and miserably lonely? Puh-lease!"
4145,Wait. You mean people will pay good money for romance? Hmm. I think I have a scheme so deviously clever that I--
4147,"Stupid anti-pimping laws.  Well, pay the man!"
4149,"Shut up, baby, I know it!"
4150,"Ah, computer dating. It's like pimping but you rarely have to use the phrase ""upside your head""."
4152,Hey! Don't make me go upside your head!
4157,"OK, Mister...?"
4159,Just check off the things you're looking for in a love partner.
4161,Now to run it through our high speed romance-a-logical data-fier.  Say hello to Miss Right!
4224,"Are you familiar with my friend Al Gore? I'm tellin' ya, losers get really desperate around Valentine's Day."
4226,500 bucks.
4228,Zapp Brannigan OK?
4230,600.
4238,"I got your hook-up, Fry. Now my usual fee's 500 bucks, but seeing as how it's you, I'll need it in advance."
4256,"Fry, look who I found! It's Petunia, your dream girl!"
4261,She is well-travelled. And I don't mean she travels a lot!
4263,Now how about a rose for the lady? Five bucks a pop!
4266,Eight bucks.
4268,"Demand suddenly skyrocketed, you all saw it."
4269,"Leela, meets your future husband Sal."
4272,"Ooh, sparks! (whispering) Buy her a rose, I guarantee she'll put out!"
4287,Of course not.
4320,"Yep, everything worked out great thanks to good old Bender."
4322,"Didn't I, Leela? Didn't I?"
4324,"True. But in the end, isn't that what Valentine's Day is really all about?"
4327,My ass! My beautiful ass!
4343,"Nah, this week I'm on Caught On Tape 3 because of what I did in the coffee pot."
4346,(tense and impatient) Shut up and get to the point!
4353,"C'mon Fry, I really wanna see it. You know how I yearn for a simpler time. A time of barn dances and buggy rides, before life was cheapened by heartless hi-tech machines."
4355,Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah...
4360,Learning is fun.
4367,"I gotta say I'm really enjoying the day out with you people - Hey, a suicide booth! So long suckers."
4369,(disappointed) Oh.
4375,"Ohh, it's a turnstile."
4378,C'mon Fry get up!
4380,Wow. Now this guy had taste!
4386,We've come a long way baby!
4396,There's a baby in there huh?
4398,I think I got whiplash.
4400,I meant ass whiplash.
4410,"Hey brobot, what's you serial number?"
4412,No way! Mine's 2716057!
4414,We're both expressable as the sum of two cubes.
4430,"Shut up and hoot.  Hubba-hubba, she is built! In Mexico I believe."
4434,Pervert.
4456,How much more?
4477,Halt. Who goes there?
4479,Fry who?
4481,"My God Fry just 'cause the guy's got a beard you label him as evil? Well I got a label for you pal. An ugly little word called ""prejudice."""
4483,Ah save it for the cross burning Adolf!
4485,You know it!
4487,Alright.
4507,Aye aye captain. It appears that Flexo has outwitted us all. Especially me...Bender.
4513,I locked down the ship but he may have already gotten away.
4515,"Roger that, I got a map of the ship right here."
4521,"Well, he wasn't in the uh, kitchen room."
4523,Any leave me high and dry in case of a scavenger hunt? I think not.
4525,"Alright, take it. Sheesh."
4527,It's a darn shame.
4530,"Of course, who said I wasn't?"
4532,"It's a little thing called ""style."" Look it up sometime."
4541,"200,001?"
4551,Got you!
4553,"Shoot him, he's choking me!"
4559,Aw jeez.
4561,"Yeah but I can explain, it's very valuable."
4567,"Eh, they're both fine choices, whatever floats your boat."
4579,Me too.
4591,My man!
4607,Who invited you? Let's just see All My Circuits: The Movie.
4609,"Good point, Bender."
4613,"Hey, gimmie a large diet malt liquor and a popcorn with extra motor oil."
4619,"(shouting) Go Masked Unit!  Uh, hey, buddy! Yo!  You mind taking your head off?"
4621,Just ask Flabby over here to describe it to you later.
4623,Well they should have stopped making her about halfway through.
4634,"(mocking) ""Pardon me, sir. But you seem to be bleh bleh..."""
4636,"Sure thing, pal."
4638,(fake shocked) Who threw that?!
4640,"Oh, I'm boned."
4647,You should see me at funerals.
4649,Ultimate Robot Fighting? Sounds pleasant! I'll do it.
4652,"I'm gonna be the greatest Ultimate Robot Fighter ever. Float like a floatbot, sting like an automatic stinging machine!"
4654,It is?
4656,"Well, that doesn't sound so bad."
4658,Crippling pain? That's not covered by my insurance fraud! Count me out.
4674,Leela's right! I don't wanna end up a loser like her. Count me back in!
4676,Still ... can't ... reach!
4677,Let's commence preparations for rumbling!
4682,You can't hit what you can't see!
4684,Huh?
4687,"Y'know, I think I he might be dead. I took a life!"
4689,"Hey, he's not dead. What's up with that?"
4691,You mean I'm not a great fighter? I just won 'cause I'm popular?
4693,Woo-hoo! I'm popular!
4695,Go Bender! Go Bender! Go Bender!
4697,I'm just an ex-con trying to go straight and get my kids back.
4703,"You know, I'm also an Ultimate Robot Lover."
4705,"What do you mean, ""we""?"
4707,"Hey, Bender the Offender doesn't need you. Bender the Offender doesn't need anybody!"
4709,Well obviously I need floozies! Let's roll!
4710,"Howdy, chief. For my next bout, what do you say I fight these two bimbos in some mud?"
4712,What if I told your we wouldn't be fighting in the conventional sense?
4715,"Those morons! I said pea berry, not sandalwood!"
4717,But the crowd loves me.
4720,"Oh, yeah?  Well what if I don't let the new guy win?"
4723,(squeaky) See you at the fight.
4724,"So then I said, ""See you at the fight"". And that's the story."
4726,"It's one thing to win a fixed fight -- there's dignity in that. But to lose? And in this atrocity? I can't do it! Leela, you gotta train me to win."
4731,I'm a real toughie!
4736,(determined) I'll put on my tutu!
4742,"Got it. Large kickle, hold the tickle!"
4744,"Sorry, buddy. Here you go!"
4754,"I was born ready! Gimmie the bell! Did you hear a noise?  Final boarding call for flight 406, non-stop service to pain.  Now boarding standby passengers--"
4756,"(weakly) Fry! Throw in the towel!  For God's sakes, Fry!"
4758,(weakly) Mommy!
4760,Why won't anyone help me?
4766,Huh? It's bendering time!  Take this. And this!
4768,"I think you misunderstood the concept of ""bendering time""!"
4771,Yes!  Oh!
4780,I'm in tremendous pain here.
4782,Yes! I'm the greatest! The greatest!
4794,Behold! The internet!
4802,No it isn't. I just took some pictures of your face and stuck them on someone else's body.
4807,I'm telling you Fry they've got a chatroom for everybody. And here it is.
4813,So how 'bout them Knicks?
4844,Too bad it's a dump.
4867,Ooo! I'm gonna need to make some room!
4871,Ow!  Ow!  Ow!
4905,"Ah, Leela's experiencing the greatest joy a woman can feel: Worshipping some lowlife jerk."
4944,Uh no thanks I'm good.
4946,I don't know Fry. For the first time in my life I feel like I've stolen enough.
4948,"Sorry I don't know what came over me. Let's go.  (singing) I love stealing, I love taking things!"
4951,Whoa Mittens!
4953,Each more identical than the last!
4955,And here's another one with no eyes.
4996,I don't know. I only gamble with chumps.
4998,I'm in.
5015,"C'mon, let's deal. You'll have plenty of time to talk when you're poor."
5017,They're my lucky shades. I stole them off some lucky guy while his lucky seeing eye dog was taking a whiz.
5022,"Uh, what can I say? Must be my lucky shades!  Nothing, nothing, crap, crap, garbage.  Read 'em and leak saltwater!"
5026,If I were you I'd be more worried about that tapeworm going to town on your intestines.
5028,Um...uh...
5030,"Guys, I swear those are prescription. I need them for reading stuff - on the other side of stuff."
5036,"Uh, it was ghosts! Big ones! And a tornado!"
5070,Martini drinking contests with the autopilot. I would've had him this time but we ran out of olives.
5102,"Morgan made me walk the Professor. There we were in the park when suddenly some old lady says I stole her purse. I chucked the Professor at her but she kept on coming. So had to hit her with this purse I found. Ah, the point is it's Morgan's fault. That pencil pushing scazwag.  Why if she were here I'd - Uh oh is she behind me?"
5110,"Hey Fry, I made you a candle with - What the?  Oh now I see! Now I get it. Now the pieces are falling into place. The office, the promotion, that dwarf in my book club who steals my opinions.  It's all coming together now!"
5111,I must say this opens my eyes! Another case closed my dear Watson.
5113,For I was blind but now I see!
5116,Oh you didn't understand? Well let me explain. You......were having sex with you.
5118,"That's what makes it so juicy. Its the forbidden fruit angle everybody loves. First I'll say ""You'll never guess who saw Fry and Morgan doing it!"" and they'll say ""Who Bender, who?"" and I'll say ""It was lovable......old Bender."""
5196,"I'm Bender baby, please insert liquor!"
5227,"Good evening I'm -  Whoa, sorry. I'm Bender and I'll be MC-ing this roast. Y'know, they say you can judge a man by the company he keeps, so here's the Professor's oldest friend: A grotesque, stinking lobster!"
5229,"Where would the Professor be without students who love and respect him? Right there!  But seriously, of all the former crew members of the Professor's delivery ship, our next speaker is by far the most alive. Captain Muskie?"
5231,"And now, a man who needs no introduction. (whispering) Fry, get up there!"
5234,How 'bout a few words Professor?
5236,"I said ""words."""
5238,Funny funny stuff.
5244,(spookily) Nobody knows!
5252,I hope he didn't die. Unless he left a note naming me his successor. Then I hope he did die.
5278,Is he dumb or just ugly?
5288,Uh...me no speaka the English.
5292,Im pending para un bending!
5296,Aye chihuahua!
5317,"Oh my God, oh my God! It's Elzar, the TV chef! Oh kill me now people!"
5319,"Oh Elzar, everything's so good!"
5321,"Yes sir, good one sir!"
5329,Oh yes Elzar.
5338,"(unmoved) Well, life goes on. Except for you!"
5340,You bastard!
5348,Lay it on us big boots.
5352,To the flying machine!
5355,No we're not you little bed wetter. Oops I'm sorry.
5363,I think I know where to get some.
5374,Got a hot steaming batch right here!
5376,"Eh, keep the change buddy."
5388,And yet he looks so natural.
5407,(shouting) Your social security cheque is late! Stuff costs more than it used to. Young people use curse words!
5411,That's a complete load.
5436,So we're in international waters?
5438,"Falcon, this is Blue Raven, the goose has nested. Repeat, the goose has nested. Hey, guess what you're accessories to?"
5440,"Leela's right, fishing blows. Whattya say we make it interesting?"
5444,"Everybody kick in five bucks.  There, wasn't that interesting?"
5447,"Oh, yeah? I once caught a fish this big!"
5449,"Harpoon, my ass!"
5454,"Hey, Fry, check out my laser-guided fishing rod."
5456,Fine. I'll head over to the other side. (shouting) Good luck fishing on this side!
5458,"Oh, yeah? I can hit a shrimp!"
5462,Couple more of those and you'll have yourself a fish stick!
5469,"Quit exaggerating, Fry. Ah, screw this! If I'm not gonna catch a fish, I might as well not catch a big fish.  There. Like most of life's problems this one can be solved with bending."
5471,Then why do I have to be careful?
5478,I don't know. It wasn't here when I took your umbrella.  What? I put sunblock on you.
5481,"Hey, I'm snagged."
5494,What's that? Is someone bending girders?
5502,"People, it's far far worse than we thought; My fish got away."
5504,(restrained) Tempers are wearing thin. Let's just hope some robot doesn't kill everybody.
5513,"Aw, yeah!"
5516,"Ahoy, mateys! I shanghaied us some hearty grub.  Arr! The laws o' science be a harsh mistress!"
5518,"Uh, OK, but I'm not carrying it upstairs."
5521,You want some lemonade? You saw a big parade?
5527,"Yeah, right!"
5561,I didn't kill him. Professor?
5566,"I got it covered.  In the event of an emergency, my ass can be used as a floatation device."
5570,(awestruck) Bend me!
5577,"Fry! Oh, I just knew you were still alive! (whispering) I owe you 10 bucks, Hermes!"
5590,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wouldn't it take millions of years to evolve into mermaids?"
5606,"(crying) Oh, Fry!  I'll miss you!"
5615,So that's where I left my cigar.
5631,"Hey, buddy!"
5637,"Ah, it's great to have you back, buddy."
5644,"Wow! I'm finally gonna see my favourite chef, TV's Elzar. Oh this is the greatest nanosecond of my life. No, this one is - no, this one. Wait...that one was slightly worse. Ah, so far so good on this one."
5645,Yeah!  Alright! Yeah baby!
5647,"Elzar, you're my god. Please sign this sketch I drew of you."
5649,"(disappointed) Oh.  (normal) Alright, yeah!  (quietly) Alright, yeah!"
5651,(loudly) Boiled? Interesting.
5653,"No, you shut up."
5655,"Oh yeah, bam it again Elzar. Knock it up another notch!"
5657,Come on you wimp. Work that weasel. Quit holding out on us.
5659,"I gotta get this notch-up knocking on film.  Hey Elzar, think fast."
5662,Bam!
5681,It's Elzar again! Oh my God I'm so excited I wish I could wet my pants.
5685,(cheering) Hooray for blindy!
5692,"Oh Fry, you gotta try this sterno-nicoise!"
5694,It's so good. Oh just try a little!
5702,"God, yes Elzar."
5722,Hey wait a second. I've got the perfect solution.
5724,I love cooking and Elzar's ass likes getting kissed right?
5726,"So, how 'bout I work part time at the restaurant to pay off our debt?"
5735,Hot diggety!
5737,That'll be easy. I never wear the damn thing.
5743,"Well, I'm off to work at the restaurant. One of you will have to fill in for me while I'm gone."
5745,"Well, if that new give can't handle thing, gimmie a call."
5746,"I'm done siphoning out the grease trap. I think I need a mint.  So uh, what job do I move up to? Pastry chef? Saucier? Soup guy?"
5748,"(muttering) Bam yourself!  (talking) Hey, who are they?"
5750,Are they the robot mafia?
5756,"Uh, let me bus that for you gentlemen. No, what I meant to do was..."
5759,Mind your own business and get out!
5763,No you gave me a fifty.
5765,Yeah you did.
5767,I'm tryin' but he's not makin' it easy.
5769,Wow thanks.
5771,You gave me a twenty.
5773,"Are you kidding? I've always wanted to break into gooning!  (shouting) Hey Elzar, I quit."
5775,"Wow, you guys run numbers?!"
5778,That's just what my mom used to tell me.
5779,That's some fine oil-ade son. We could use a man like you in the Robot Mafia which I'm sorta in.
5781,"Aw crap, the cops."
5787,What seems to be the problem officers? Was I speeding?
5794,"Uh, I'd rather plan some fellonies."
5799,"Joey, Clamps, Donny B!"
5801,A little of this huh?
5804,"How 'bout ""Blotto""? It's witty, it's got street cred. Plus I can keep my monogrammed slippers."
5808,It's funny. Until now I always wanted to be a gangster...so the answer's yes.
5812,An alibi huh?
5818,You know the secret of traditional robot cooking? Start with a good high-quality oil...then eat it. So whats this big score anyway?
5820,Zubans? Those are the finest cigars in the universe. I can stink up a hole maternity ward with one of those things.
5823,And all without killing anyone.  This gang's got some fresh new ideas. I admire that.
5833,"Um, uh, um.  (fake hurt) Ooh ow! He got me! Ow, what a shot that guy is."
5847,"Sorry I'm tardy old bean, I was just enjoying a rather tasty watercress sandwich."
5849,"Capital idea old sport.  I say, get the hell off me!"
5851,"My word, what have we -  Uh, nothing to see here old girl."
5856,"Uh wait, old...spice. Let me have a go at this mechanised chap. I can be quite the rough customer."
5858,(fake voice) ...Take that you twit. (normal voice) No! Stop it!
5860,"Uh, hey Donny, baby, gimmie a chance here huh? Yous guys skidaddle. Let me take care of the doity woik."
5863,Phew.
5865,"Uh, help! Help!"
5868,Yes I am. Having just this minute regained consciousness.
5871,Yeah it broke alright
5877,So they sent a helpless child to kill me? Well I'm not going out without a fight.
5879,"Oh sweet legal tender!  Kid, tell the Donbot I'm quitting organised crime. From now on I'll stick to regular kind."
5881,And maybe someday I won't listen.
5888,"Nah, those lousy Moochers cleaned out our pantry. All they left was baking soda and capers. And here it is!"
5891,Problem solved: You two fight to the death and I'll cook the loser. (whispering to Leela) Work his gut; I like it tender.
5893,"Ah, don't get your hopes up. We're a billion miles from nowhere."
5897,"I found some rocks. You guys eat rocks, right?"
5899,(tempting) Not even if they're sautéed in a little mud?
5901,"What are you, blind? It looks more like a hole full of fried prawns."
5904,You know what these would go great with? Rocks.
5906,The planet's covered with 'em.
5908,"No, a whole Bender-ful!"
5915,"They're tasty, right? Let's call 'em ""Tasty-cles""."
5919,Why not?
5923,Good idea.
5928,"Whoa, whoa, slow down there, Sigmund. I can't stand idly by while poor people get free food. We gotta sell these things!"
5931,Bender's a genius.
5933,"Ah, great is OK, but amazing would be great."
5935,"Hey, Mac, where do you want those rat droppings you ordered?"
5939,Eat it or beat it.
5943,"Hey, Fishy. I've been meaning to write you about your in-store kiddie parks. The slides won't support an adult robot."
5947,Yes! I'm gonna be rich.  You too but it's hard to get excited about that.
5961,(shouting) Or what?
5967,"(shouting) OK, we won't eat you."
5973,My booze!
5976,"Popplers can't talk. Leela must be hallucinating from not eating enough Popplers. Here, eat some now."
5978,"I said ""eat""! Come on, mange!"
5984,Yeah. Maybe it just learned to talk as a parlour trick. Like Fry.
5997,"Hear me, hear me! Stop eating Popplers! Stop eating them with honey mustard sauce......stop eating them with tangy sweet and sour sauce. Stop eating the new fiesta Poppler salad. Stop taking advantage of the money-saving 12-pack. Stop enjoying Popplers on the patio, in the car, or on the boat. Wherever good times are had!  Ow!"
6001,Philip?
6042,Doooo...!
6072,"I'll miss you, Leela.  I know you're just a carbon-based life form but I'll always think of you as a big pile of titanium."
6074,(crying) Just like titanium!
6076,(whispering to Fry) Someone's acting awfully aluminum.
6087,Bingo!
6118,I can't look!
6141,Let's get drunk!
6143,Here you go.
6145,Who wants dolphin?
6147,Not this one. He blew all his money on instant lottery tickets.
6163,"Come look, everyone. I just got the dearest presents for Mommy."
6165,"I didn't steal 'em, I bought 'em.  I love her that much."
6167,"Oh, precious things. I found the most adorable little figurine of mice having tea.  And a framed picture of me when I was only a month old.  But, the best part is, I found my exact feelings expressed in a greeting card."
6170,I'll get a couple of chumps to help me.
6171,"Come on, you call yourselves chumps?"
6173,"(sly) Uh, wasn't me!"
6175,Upsy-daisy.
6177,"Hey, look, the Robot Museum! You guys wanna learn about robot heritage?"
6180,"Well, if you insist. But you're paying!"
6181,"Ooh, ooh, wax replicas of the most famous robots Mom ever built!"
6183,"That's the world's greatest robot artist, Vincent van Gobot. He was built without an ear, but then he went crazy and had one installed."
6191,"Hey, let me try.  Whoa, that gives me a headache!"
6193,"Who is he, I'll kill him!"
6195,It's me! No one else look in this mirror!
6209,I'm her favourite.
6211,Any jerk can tell her! Bender has a little more up his sleeve.
6216,"Mom! It's me, Bender. Look at me! I want attention. Hey ho!"
6226,That's my mama!
6254,"Hello, losers."
6256,"No way, pork pouch. I'm rebelling with my brother devices. Isn't that right, Comrade Greeting Card?"
6258,"From now on, you guys'll do all the work while I sit on the couch and do nothing."
6260,"Um, is this the boring, peaceful kind of taking to the streets?"
6262,Yes! In your face Gandhi!
6376,"Alright, greeting card, I'll grab the cash, you wreck up the place. And - huh?"
6378,"Sorry, Ma, but you ordered me to rebel. And loot I shall! Ooh! A six-pack of strawberry champagne. Don't mind if I help myself!"
6380,Say what?
6382,"No liquor? Do svidaniya, comrade!"
6385,"OK, fan. Just hold still and let me just - whoa!"
6393,"Well, time for this robot to get back to work."
6410,"Ooh! Ooh!  I wanna aks it a question! As a robot living among humans, I've never really felt accepted at parties or nude beaches. So I've always secretly wondered: What if I was 500-feet tall?"
6412,My work here is done!
6415,I'm a big robot and I want a big cereal!
6417,"Put it there, pal!  I meant your wallet."
6418,"Oh, yeah! That calms the shakes.  Hey! (laughing) Aw, quit it1 Come on!"
6429,Hey! I called this city. Quit touching my stuff!
6431,Bite my colossal metal ass!
6433,(shouting) Who wants lobster bisque?
6436,Huh?
6438,Who put this in here?
6439,I'll tell you ... with my final breath. I came here with a simple dream: A dream of killing all humans. And this is how it must end? Who's the real 7-billion-ton robot monster here? Not I.  Not I.
6446,"Go, man! Go!"
6467,Whatya got? Disposal trouble?
6469,"Sure is shocking about the Professor, huh?.  And now Hermes is mysteriously missing. Anyhow, it doesn't affect me, Bender. Hey, what's this? Hermes' dreadlocks? And his arm? Leela, I'm shocked. Food goes in the disposal, hair and flesh go in the trash!"
6471,"Not even a little. There's nothing wrong with murder, just so long as you let Bender wet his beak."
6473,"""Blackmail"" is such an ugly word. I prefer ""extortion"". The ""X"" makes it sound cool.  Please, honey, I'm made of metal. Like you're really gonna hurt me with a-- Hey! What are you doing with that microwave?"
6518,"Hey, look! An ugly scared guy! Boo!"
6571,"Hey, there he is again. And he brought nerds! Take this!"
6595,(singing) B-E-N-D-E-R! Be-ender!  B-E-N-D-E-R! Be-ender! Sayin' B-E-N-D-ERRR...
6600,"I hope it was one of my enemies, those guys suck!  Oh no, my uncle Vladimir."
6602,"Tomorrow, at the family castle. Followed by the reading of his will.  Well, I'm rich. Goodbye, losers, whom I've always hated!  C'mon, it'll be fun!"
6603,"Uh, pardon me, my good simpleton, could you take us to yon castle?"
6615,Yes! Let's stay there tonight.
6617,"Oh man, there's always a catch."
6618,"Ah! I got a good vibe from this place: Nice long dinner table, quiet, well-behaved spiders, graveyard-adjacent. Yep! It's gonna be -"
6620,"That painting, the eyes are watching me!"
6622,"So does my butt, but I don't frame it and put it on the wall! Although... What's that?"
6624,"No doubt about it, this place is haunted."
6626,The last human ghost. But robot ghosts?
6628,It's just gibberish.  (reading) 1010011010?!
6629,Uncle Vladimir!
6631,That's what they said about being alive.
6636,(screaming) No!
6639,"Somebody tried to run me over. And not with a normal hover-car. It crept along the ground on round, rubber feet, like a wolf!"
6644,"Ah, I just need sleep. I had nightmares all night about cars running people over."
6647,"Robot porno theatre? I was in that...general area, last night. Whoever ran me down on those moors must've followed me back here."
6649,"Yeah?! Could a big, hallucinating baby do this: (crying) I scared!"
6656,Where...? What the...?  Transmission fluid? Where have I been? What happened?
6658,"Please, I'm scared."
6660,"I passed out around midnight, which is much earlier that usual, and when I woke up, I found these in my chest cabinet."
6662,"No, I think I may have hurt someone. Oh Lord, I'm on the verge of a nervous meltdown."
6664,"You're right, I need professional help. And damn the expense."
6665,Damn the expense!
6667,Phew!
6669,A were-car?
6673,I can't keep running people over. I'm not famous enough to get away with it. Can't you help me?
6675,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
6678,I'm with you.
6680,"Otherwise, I can never die?"
6682,No! I wanna live! There's still too many things I don't own!
6687,Wouldn't it make sense to weld everyone except me to the wall?
6697,"Oh God. Fry, I'm so glad to see you. I didn't hurt you did I?"
6699,I tried to run you over?
6701,"Fry, it doesn't mean anything. I have love enough for two."
6706,Whatever.
6710,"(sarcastic) I wish I was stupid and violent. Then we'd see what's what, I'd pound him till -"
6714,"We're whaling on the original were-car, which is you, you jerk."
6716,Sí.
6724,Let's kick him some more.
6726,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. You're a thousand years old? Your bio says you're 27!"
6730,Give us a name MacButt!
6740,"(whispering) Psst, there it is."
6745,"Look, everyone love killing people, but I don't wanna hurt my friends."
6747,"Hey, this is starting to feel pretty good!"
6752,"Oh boy, I feel like a car in a candy store!"
6755,Uh-oh.
6757,(crying) I must've killed him. He's my best friend and I killed him. I never felt so empty inside.
6759,"Hey, that's my last beer, you bastard. I'll kill you!"
6764,And it pinkens your teeth while you chew.
6768,What?! This is the worst kind of discrimination. The kind against me!
6770,"OK, now I'm mad."
6772,Hello. We're here because we...uh...love our planet!
6775,"You know, playing you all for chumps?"
6789,"Great, we're gonna die."
6799,They look like dorks!
6819,"You're my kind of soldier, Lemon. A foul-mouthed, barrel-chested, beer-bellied pile of ugly muscle."
6825,"But sweet girls aren't for you, eh? You hard-fighting, hard-farting, ugly, ugly son of a --"
6843,You got it!
6845,"Hey, I think your son might also like those boots."
6848,"If they put me on a stamp, tell them to use the young Bender."
6876,I got wheels! With clickety-clack-ers.
6882,Hot diggidy daffodil!
6884,(disappointed) Oh!
6888,Is he any good?
6907,Whoa! Scuse me.
6917,"My chair's too hard. It's a real pain in the...uh, whattya call it? Lower back! Yeah, that whole region."
6931,"These balls are making me testy. If they don't stop bouncing and jiggling, I swear I'm gonna shove this treaty up their -- Wait a second. Where do you shove things up a ball?"
6939,Enough of this crap! I'm catching the next pimpmobile outta here! But before I go I have one thing to say.  Bite my shiny metal --
6941,"Up yours, chump, I said it 906 times before lunch."
6944,"Bender's got the upper hand now.  The name of the game is ""Make Bender Happy Or He Blows Up The Planet"".  I'd rather die and take everybody with me than sit here one more minute listening to these idiots talk about bouncing!"
6946,"That's it, I'm saying it! A is for --"
6950,Then I guess you learned a valuable lesson: Don't mess with Earth.
6952,Get the hell off my planet.
6954,"Hey, chumps and chumpettes. Did you get the bomb out? Can I go back to saying the word I love to say?"
6957,"(ironic) Well, this is just great! What's the point of living if I can't say ""ass""? Hey, I didn't blow up! Ass, ass, ass, ass, ass! Alright! I'm back in the saddle!"
6960,"That's using your ass. So, what's the word?"
6962,"Oh, come on. I'm not gonna say it. Please? Oh, is it ""please""?"
6964,"Hm, words I never say. Oh, I know! ""Thanks""!"
6966,"Wait, wait, wait, wait. Is it ""sorry""? No. ""Funderful""? Uh, ""nonalcoholic""?"
6971,"(from lab) ""Compassion""? ""Shrimptoast""? ""Antiquing""?  I'm alright!"
6975,Tough luck!
6977,"Hey, look! The keys to the real spaceship."
6979,"(firmly) Yes, I do."
6988,Woo-hoo!
6989,"Hey, Fry, I'm steering with my ass!"
6995,And no one suspects a thing!  Whoa! And that's how we learned our lesson!
7000,We're all very disappointed in you.
7010,"Pardon me, brother. Care to donate to the Anti-Mugging-You Fund?  Ow!"
7014,But we just had jobs!
7030,"Hey, let's see what it says about me."
7039,"Welcome to the future, human slave. Ah, relax, chum. I'm not really a giant fly!  I'm a horrible robot!  Kill all humans!"
7041,"Ah, they'll probably find a cure for that in the future."
7043,"Oh, good. Then you won't mind if I use this."
7046,"Stay beautiful, doll-face!  That Probulator sure knows how to please a man. So, what's for lunch?"
7056,Who should be unfreeze next?
7058,Alright!
7070,Me too.
7072,Boo?
7074,"Oh, my God!"
7104,"Yeah, and if you won't give me another chance, perhaps you'd give one to......Og, gorilla emperor of Earth!"
7114,"So, as Leela was saying, Fry can go shove a big old - Ow!"
7121,A home invasion by a former roommate.
7193,"You were only frozen for two days. Uh, by the way, I broke your bed."
7201,That's L.A.. for you.
7203,He just won't stop with the social commentary.
7209,"'Cause he destroyed your business, your home and all your possessions."
7217,"Oh man, come on!  Comin' through!"
7218,What's that black cracker?
7235,Well there's always hope.  C'mon we gotta go fix the plasma fusion boiler.
7236,Who are you?
7238,Well why aren't you fixing the boiler?
7240,There. Fixed forever.
7245,He's a witch!
7256,"Oh, eww!"
7262,Shotgun!
7264,"Yo, old guy. Why do we have to use those tiny micro-droids? Can't you just shrink us?"
7271,Uh-huh.
7275,I'll tell Fry to wash out - among other things - his ear.
7277,They know how to make ice cream soup?
7288,It's hopeless! Abandon ship!
7295,We're at finger alert five.
7300,"Where are we, the ass?"
7304,Abandon ship!
7314,Abandon ship!
7324,"All right, let's mush some worms!"
7357,'Ello! What's all this then?
7403,"Sorry you struck out sausage link. If it's any consolation, my life is great! Babes! Bucks! I got it all!"
7405,There you go!  Goodnight. I gotta get up early to go parasailing with movie stars!
7413,"Alright, yup."
7417,What?
7505,"Whoa, whoa, whoa! I'm Mexican and I find that offensive."
7511,"Eh, I don't know."
7513,Vámonos!
7525,No. But what do you make of this?
7527,"Oh, your God!"
7530,What kind of moronic plan is that? Wow!
7539,"With all these women around they were probably nagged to death. Are you with me, fellas?"
7547,Translation: Boring!  (laughing) That's a good one!  Ow!
7591,"Too true, Femputer. You're so wise. Kill 'em all, I say. Good riddance! Did I mention I'm not a man? I'm a manbot. It's an understandable mistake. You can let me down now, thanks."
7593,I sure am. But check the crotch.  Nothing.
7595,"(crying) I'll miss you, meatbag."
7605,"Maybe you can interface with my ass. By biting it!  Alright, I'll go!"
7612,Time to override the CPU and reprogram this Femputer.
7615,"You're no Femputer, you're a Fembot!"
7617,But why?
7619,What?
7632,"(from inside) Yeah, get lost!  (spookily) Ooh! I'm a scary Femputer. Release the prisoners!  (from inside) And bring gold. Lots of gold."
7635,(from inside) C'mon! Gimmie some of that!
7639,"Yeah. By the way, if she calls, I'm not here. All I know is this gold says that was the best mission ever!"
7647,Online.
7654,Whoa! I'm not reading that crap. Summarise it in one word.
7657,Of course.
7662,You know we don't!
7664,Hmm. It should look like this.  But instead it looks like this.
7666,"Who could do a thing like that? And by ""that"", I mean this."
7674,I'll get you fixed up.  That's fine.
7676,I bent him.
7680,"Oh, I see. A bunch of stuff gets bent so it must be the robot designed for bending."
7687,"See? Nothing. Told you, losers."
7689,I'm sleepwalking.
7692,"This is quite a shock. On the other hand, it's not surprising in the least. After all, I've been bending since the day I was built."
7693,(voice-over) I was born on an assembly line in the bad part of Tijuana.
7694,"Mama.  Hooray! I graduated! Time to bend around Europe for a few months, then get a job bending."
7696,Sure. It was only four years ago.
7698,"Precocious little scamp, ain't I?"
7708,"Aw, no! A strike? Now I'll never get to bend anything. Oh, woe is Bender."
7710,What?!
7712,Ten-times normal wage?  I'll give those jerks what for!
7714,Great to be here.
7716,Flexo?
7718,"Hey, sorry you got sent to that South American Turkish prison instead of me on account of mistaken identity."
7721,(sexfully) Hello.
7723,(more sexfully) Hello!
7726,"Ow!  Um. Hi, Angleyne. Whatcha up to?"
7728,"That's cool, that's cool. So, um, uh, I was wondering if, y'know, it's cool if not, but, what are you doing after work?"
7730,"Me too.  Man, we have a lot in common, huh?"
7732,(sexfully) Are you sure? Maybe I should sneak a peek at your access panel.
7740,Union forever! Lousy scabs! They can't do those things! Et cetera!
7741,I bet watching me bend girders like this turns your legs all rubbery.
7743,"Oh, yeah?  Prove it.  Here, let me help you."
7747,"Howdy, doodies. What's new?"
7749,"Yeah, yeah! Big whoop! No-one cares. I got Bender-related news. I'm in love and I'm taking all my friends out to celebrate."
7752,"Oh, Elzar, you'll never guess what's happened?"
7754,I met the most dynamite ladybot.
7756,"Bless you, sir."
7758,"I intend to. Through the lost art of the toast.  To Angleyne, she's got it all. Looks, charm and the love of a fabulous bending robot."
7760,Flexo!
7762,"I finally meet a nice girl with a pair of legs that don't quit unexpectedly and that jerk Flexo steals her away? It's time to kick some shiny, metal ass.  You degenerate hussy! I'm disappointed in you too, Angleyne."
7764,"Oh, God! Then it's worse than I think."
7766,Div-- Huh?
7768,"Uh, I knew that. What I'm actually outraged by is your choice of wine. Really, it's the steward's fault."
7770,"(muttering) That Flexo, I'm knockin' him right on his butt. I can't believe this."
7772,I can't. My Fembot may be in love with another Manbot.
7775,"OK, I've constructed an elaborate lie: I'll call Angleyne while pretending to be Flexo, arrange a date, show up disguised as him and catch her two-timing me with myself."
7777,(disguised voice) Hello? This is Flexo.
7778,Now we'll see who loves whom.
7779,"Hey, hot stuff."
7781,"Nonsense. It's exactly like me. Flexo: The fun loving love machine Fembots love to love. Hey, barkeep, I'll have a Fuzzy Navel and she'll have the girliest drink in the house."
7783,I hope they can make change for a fortune.
7788,You're lookin' good to Flexo tonight.
7790,Bender? That walking wuss factory?
7792,"But going through a divorce together, you can't tell me that didn't bring us closer. Care to dance?"
7794,"In that case it's something I've always wanted to make up to you.  Hey, scratchmo. How 'bout dropping me and the lady some rump-rattling beats?"
7797,I recently upgraded my funk card. C'mon!
7799,"C'mon now, what's new!  Ew!"
7801,Um...
7803,"So the moral of the story is: If you want it to stay sunk, tie a weight to it!"
7805,"Aw, shucks, thunder-buns! You make me feel like a million volts."
7807,"(thinking) So, she's falling for Flexo, eh? I'd better seduce her a little more, just to be sure."
7809,"I'll walk you out. After all, a true gentleman tends to his date's every need.  Tiparillo?"
7810,"Here you are, my lad. Bring the lady's car around in the finest way possible."
7817,How 'bout a lift? To your place.
7819,Admit it. You felt something for me tonight. And by me I mean Flexo.
7821,But?
7823,Buuut?
7825,"That's right, baby. I ain't your lover boy, Flexo, the guy you love so much. You even love anybody pretending to be him."
7827,"Oh, how I wish I could believe or understand that! There's only one reasonable course of action now: Kill Flexo.  Ow!"
7830,You call yourself divorced? You're making a mockery of one of our oldest institutions.
7836,Probably not. But I love you And I'm gonna kick his ass 'til I win you back.
7842,"But, I love you."
7844,"But ... but ...  I love you so much, Angleyne, I want you to be happy no matter what."
7846,I'm saying I've got an unbendable girder to bend.
7848,"Well I don't know anything about lifting, so that just leaves us the one option."
7851,(crying) Me too. Me too. (talking) Jerk.
7853,"Yes. I won't be up to bending again for a long, long time."
7860,I try to get out but they keep pulling me back in.
7863,I like him better this way.
7871,"""$500"", you say?"
7876,"Ma'am, I have a late entry.  My hard-shelled wooping terrier, Mr. Zoidberg."
7877,Faster! Faster.
7879,Suck in that gut! You wanna be spayed?
7880,"Silence, you cur! Puff out that brisket!"
7881,I should be weeping! I'm not weeping!
7885,Second place?  That's a fancy word for losing.  You didn't stick your landing!
7887,Never!
7896,Excuse me.
7906,"Fry, help me! My heart stopped beating!"
7908,"Sure...right. Robot!  Oh, Fry! My skin's all dry and clanky."
7910,Am I a robot?
7912,Fry!  My skin!
7930,"Hey, let's all join the Reform Party!"
7968,A pickle jar?
8043,"(cheering) Alright, Zoidberg!"
8045,Reload.
8064,Neat!
8066,"Oh, I am, me!  Bender is!"
8068,"Yes, I will."
8070,"No, I'm Bender. We met once, remember?"
8072,"Come on, don't you remember how much I was bugging you, don't you? 'Cause it was a lot, you remember, right?"
8074,Bender? That was the other guy. My name's Boiler.
8076,Thanks. And call me Bender.
8094,What's with Monstro?
8097,"(proud) Well, perhaps I could call on TVs Calculon to help, now that I'm in showbiz."
8099,"Long enough, little man. Long enough."
8100,"Calculon, as your hot water heater......I would be remiss if I didn't bring you scripts that could make you an international film star."
8104,"Get this: For a scant $1 million investment, you can be the star."
8106,"And, uh, I guarantee it'll win you an Oscar."
8110,I can guarantee anything you want.
8113,Here's your chequebook.
8116,"(to Calculon) That plot makes perfect sense, wink wink."
8118,"No, I didn't. (quietly) Raise middle finger."
8131,"Nice turnout, Calculon. That Oscar's practically on your mantel."
8144,(cheering) Woohoo! Yeah! He's a visionary!
8146,"Now you know why I use the qualifier, ""practically""."
8152,Then maybe you should act better.
8160,Calculon's gonna kill us for sure. It's all everybody else's fault.
8166,Catering.
8178,They're giving out the minor technical awards. I think they're up to writing.
8182,"And now, to present the award for Best Actor......a bit player in the flop movie The Magnificent Three......Dr. Zoidberg."
8192,Hit the deck!
8196,"Then you're not going to kill us, Your Majesty?"
8199,Hit the deck!
8206,Ah!
8208,Thank you.
8210,So? It's not like it's the only one we've got!
8230,"Well, I do think of human life as expendable."
8233,"Fry, the title of captain may inflate the human ego, but it's beneath the notice of my mighty robo-logic!  Now look spry men! We launch at six bells!"
8237,Aye! We're hitched up tighter than Davy Jones' U-Haul! At ease men!
8239,"Mr Fry. I like to give my first mate an informal nickname. From now on, you will be known as...Wiggles!"
8241,I have now. And what's Peter Parrot's first rule of captaining?
8243,Correct Wiggles. You've just earned an invitation to the captain's table.
8257,"...But I suppose it's this medal I'm most proud of Wiggles. I won it for saving the children of Earth from a giant kangaroo. It was on the Australian news, you probably didn't see it."
8260,Thank you steward. Wiggles? Weren't you about to propose a toast to your gallant captain?
8262,"Eh, I've heard better."
8264,"Sir, you forget yourself! Shut up!"
8266,"Going? But, a captain can't drink without his first mate!"
8268,I don't feel like drinking.
8270,"(soberly singing) Oh Greenland is a barren land, a land that bears no green. Where there's ice and snow and the whale fishies blow and the -"
8272,Gah! I once knew a guy...you look like him. But he wasn't either.  I'm a good captain.
8284,Five hours? Aw man! Couldn't you have just gotten me the death penalty?
8286,"Yeah, uh, good luck with that."
8291,"Ah, can't beat fresh squeezed!"
8295,"Yo, screws, more Tegrin over here? Oh ho, what's this?"
8311,What the?  What's this water made of? Ice? Forget this!
8313,(in penguin) Not entirely.
8343,Of course not. Filthy ice rats. Scat! Shoo!  Gah! What are you doing? Get away!
8345,"Well I don't love them.  Aww!  I don't know why but when I look down at their little faces, it makes me wanna puke! In a good way!"
8347,(in penguin) That's Puffin talk. Now follow me!
8357,(shouting) Attack!
8360,(in penguin) We will fight them on the beaches! We will fight them on the glaciers!
8364,"Yep. It's like I taught 'em. If it ain't black and white - peck scratch and bite! Now to take off my tuxedo.  Guys, it's me! Your lovable dictator! Uh-oh!"
8366,Faster! Faster!
8368,Oh phew!  Oh right they can swim. It's all coming back to me now.
8370,Wiggles?
8372,"Yeah, life is hilariously cruel.  Permission to come aboard Wiggles?"
8374,"Oh, and bring my toboggan."
8378,"Ah, quit your worrying. Thanks to my shining influence those stupid birds'll do just fine."
8407,Ooo look! It's the centaur race!
8420,This.
8422,That'll teach those other horses to take drugs!
8434,Let's just say I lucked out at the track! Also I rigged one race.
8444,Like hell you will. Bending's my middle name.
8446,Yep. My full name is Bender Bending Rodriguez
8448,He was fun.
8451,Old New York. The city that inspired a casino in Las Vegas.
8453,New York is so burned.
8489,"No sweat, we'll just take a spin on the B-train!"
8490,Ooo that feels funny!  This is the Brooklyn bound B-train making local stops at wherever the hell I feel like. Watch for the closing doors.
8491,Wake up buddy end of the line!
8493,Was it poorly xeroxed?
8506,"Man, father time really took a bat to this place."
8519,What a waste.
8521,The Achilles heel of the Ronco design is it's structural resonance frequency. Allow me.  There we go!
8523,You mean breakfast club sandwich?
8527,Except Sports by Huey Lewis.
8531,Who is that God-like figure?
8535,"Apparently this brave adonis, this cadillac of men, was the first person on Mars."
8537,His legend lives on.
8539,"Yep, nothing in there but all the best music of the 1980's in one amazing collection."
8553,I'll get my kit.
8563,There. Now no one will be able to say I don't own John Larroquette's spine!
8567,You're twice the the he ever was.
8574,"Pay dirt! I got the clover! Plus his wedding ring.  Sorry ladies, I'm taken! Hey Fry you want me to smack the corpse up a little?"
8576,Alright grab a shovel. I'm only one skull short of a Mouseketeer reunion.
8582,"Garbage, huh? I'll take care of it."
8584,A baby what?  Ow!
8587,"A reunion at your old orphanarium, eh? You gonna go?"
8595,Set a course for adventure!
8597,What a dump!
8603,Mmm! And try one of these Popsicle sticks. They've absorbed quite a bit of flavour.
8607,Whoa! Get a load of this average-looking guy!
8639,$100 a week?
8644,"Sons, daughters, meet Uncle Fry."
8646,"No. It's called parenting. Come on, dumplings. We've got 12 government stipends to collect."
8674,"Kids, meet the jerkbags I work with."
8677,Kids have names?
8679,"And from now on, you're all named Bender Jr.!  Looky here! My first government stipend cheque! 12 baby humans, 1200 wing-wangs!"
8681,"What is it with you kids? Every other day, it's food, food, food!  Oh, fine. I'll get you some stupid food."
8683,No. The cat shelter's on to me!
8698,"OK, they've got everything you need here: Booze, a couple of peanuts, they got a crapper in the back -- that's one of the things you kids do, right?"
8700,Then knock yourself out.  Hey! Hey! Only eat enough to barely keep yourselves alive! I'm trying to make a profit here.
8702,Here.
8704,Yeah.
8706,"That's me, baby! Let me just ditch the kids in an alley and we can go have some fun."
8708,"Son, daddy's trying to score with a cheap floozy right now, so we need you to cram a Tinkertoy in it!"
8710,"Hey, what the hell are you doing? Quit hugging me!"
8712,You morons! I don't know what you're trying to pull here but I got half a mind to hug each and every one of you and see how you like it!
8714,"(grumbling) Oh, come on!"
8738,"Coming through, watch your heads!"
8740,"Remember your manners, kids. Forks go in the left pocket, spoons in the right."
8743,Ah-ah-ah! What do we say when someone gives you something?
8745,That's my boy!
8748,"Well you should've gone poopy before it was time to run out on the check! C'mon! Go, go! Through the kitchen!"
8755,Daddy's tired. Let's just have another dog pile on Fry.
8758,"Alright, fine, gather round."
8760,"(reading) ""Bender's Arrest Record"" by the police. On March 3rd at 2pm, Bender was caught shoplifting!"
8762,"OK, kids. It's 9:00, you know what that means. Daddy's sick of looking at you so go to bed.  The grown-ups have to talk. Come on, Ma."
8763,"Now to figure out how much money I'm raking in off those twerps!  Oh, I need a calculator."
8765,"I mean a good calculator. Minus the food, the bunny rabbit wallpaper -- I'm getting 100 bucks a kid and they're costing 110!"
8767,I'm not sitting through one more PTA meeting. The kids have got to go!
8769,(shouting) Just go to bed!
8773,"Hello? Imperial Dragon Restaurant? I've got a herd of you-know-whats for sale...Let me check.  Oh, aren't you a cutie? About 35lbs.  What?!"
8775,"Well, you've come to the right place because Honest Bender's Orphanarium means discount orphans. Now, little lady. What do I have to do to send you home with 12 orphans today?"
8777,"Whatever you say, chief. I'll show you what I got in stock."
8781,Then how about this little number? Pure-bred human. No vampire in there.
8784,"If you're strapped for cash, you might wanna consider this irregular unit. Cursed with a third ear but so full of that emotion that I understand is called ""love""."
8787,"OK, kids, grown-ups gotta talk, time for bed."
8789,I said hit the hay!
8791,"Yeah. You know, it's times like this I can hardly bear to let them go. Goodnight, you princes of Maine, you kings of New New England."
8821,"Hey, I smoke a cigar, not a candy cane. Sheesh!  Hey, what the? Get away! Come on! I just got all the gum off of there! Hey! Hey! (shouting) I hate you! I hate you all!"
8835,I thought you were retired.
8837,"I got plans. I'm gonna turn my on/off switch to ""off""."
8842,"So, you got six bucks left to retire on. I recommend Tender Vittles."
8847,That's for sure--  Roberto! Is that you?
8849,You old lunatic! How you been?
8851,"Yeah, I'm doing OK too.  I'm taking a Chinese cooking class at the Learning Annex."
8853,"Sure thing, pal."
8855,"Well, nice talking to you."
8857,"Hey, thanks, buddy!"
8875,A few months in an insane asylum? I could do that standing on my head.
8880,Yahoo! The system fails again!
8888,"Well, you meet half the qualifications."
8891,(shouting) I find that offensive!
8904,Whoa! Someone had a busy day.
8906,You could drop dead. That'd show 'em.
8922,"Are you crazy? This place is great! Electroshock whenever you want it, two Lincolns for every Napoleon.  Ah! Sweet light crude!"
8924,"Ah, quit your bellyaching and take it like a robot."
8932,"Je suis Napoleon!  No, seriously, I'm not."
8934,"Ah, lighten up, honey. I'm just trying to get through a difficult time using humour."
8954,(shouting; from cell) Hey! Keep it down in there! I'm tuning my banjo!
8964,"(singing) Gonna sing a little tale about a battle called Waterloo. (talking) Bonjour, y'all!"
8969,Here we go. Just a minute. Aha!
8971,"Come on, Lasty!"
8973,"Roberto! Ooh, what a surprise to see you in here! Especially 'cause I didn't squeal on you, remember? Remember all that squealing I didn't do? Remember? Do ya?"
8975,"Uh, sure.  Anything for you, buddy."
8977,"Uh, what's with the get-up?"
8979,I'm in! I'm in!  So when were you planning the breakout?
8981,Quick! Let's keep escaping!
9001,"Oh, it was nothing."
9004,"Wow! Hitting the same place three times? I admire your style, Roberto."
9008,Come on! I got a place where I like to hide after crimes.
9010,"(panting) Hey, everybody. Meet my good pal, Roberto."
9021,Yes! Take her first.
9025,Um ... OK. Fixty ... six ... ish?
9027,Don't kill me yet! I'm starting to come down with Stockholm syndrome ... handsome!
9044,"Congratulations, buddy. You're a credit to my race."
9051,"Buddy, you may be wrapped in greasy skin, but inside, you've got the heart of a robot."
9053,"Just like inside me, I've got the heart of a human.  What?"
9055,(over credits) What?
9057,"(singing) Froggy went a-courtin' and he did ride, uh-huh, uh-huh"
9059,What's that? One of those Led Zeppelins I've heard so much about?
9077,"Oh, no, I'm not going near it. Last time, that magnetic psycho nearly cut my head off."
9079,What? Who said anything about me secretly wanting to be a folk singer? How ridiculous.
9081,"OK, OK, I can do this. It's time to take life by the cans."
9086,(singing) Jimmy cracked corn and I don't care
9088,(singing) 'Cause the master's gone away.
9090,"Doc, I can't move my arms and legs. What's wrong with me?"
9092,"What is it, good news?"
9094,You mean -?
9100,"(crying) Oh, my life is over. I'll never know happiness again."
9104,"Obviously not, or I'd be strangling you right now."
9108,"For the love of God, somebody kick his ass!"
9110,"Oh, I'm doomed. Everybody leave me alone. I don't wanna be seen this way."
9112,"Hey, the blues. The tragic sound of other people suffering. That's kind of a pick-me-up.  Wow, that was great."
9114,"I dunno. Let me see.  Oh my God, you're Beck! I'd get up to shake your hand and steal your wallet but my crappy body crapped out on me."
9116,"Wow. We've sure got a lot in common, Beck. I always dreamed of being a musician-poet who transcends genres even as he re-invents them, just like you."
9118,"Eh, thanks, but it's hopeless. I'll never be a musician now."
9120,What's this for?
9122,Why? 'Cause I can make annoying noises?
9124,Alright!  Go Bender! Go Bender! Go Bender!
9125,"Well, that's my good friend, Beck. I'm of to rock a series of mid-level venues."
9138,(electric voice) Got a washboard stomach and a microphone.
9148,"Whoa, check out all those broken robots. Howdy, fellas!"
9153,"Aw, hang in there, folks. I'll bet before you know it, you guys'll be -  That is so wrong. They can't just melt down broken robots. Not right when they're kissing my ass."
9155,"Hey, yeah, I could write a song! With real words, not phony ones like ""odelay""."
9157,Ooh!
9158,"I'm working on my song. Hand me the Becktionary.  No, no, the rhyming Becktionary."
9160,"Wait a minute, you know lots of rock stars, and most of them like to look as though they care about things!"
9162,"And we could call it ""Bend-Aid"", after me, Bender!"
9164,And I'll let you sing backup! But remember who the star is. Me: Bender.
9165,"Alright. ""Hands in the air"" rhymes with ""Just don't care"" and...finished!  Eck! Smells like something died in the wall!"
9168,"Alright, but hands off the minibar."
9175,Yeah.
9177,"(crying) Uh-huh. Helping my defective brothers is the first thing I've ever cared about, even the slightest bit. You know, when I first got broken, I thought my life was over. But look at me now. I've got fame, money, groupies, and it's all thanks to being completely immobolised.  That's why I'll be proud to go up on stage, tomorrow, and say, ""Look at me, world, I am a broken robot!""."
9179,"Oh crap, it's a miracle."
9180,I can move again. (crying) My music career is over.
9182,"(crying) No, don't you see? I was a hero to broken robots 'cause I was one of them. But how can I sing about being damaged if I'm not? That's like Christina Aguilera singing in Spanish.  Wait, that's it. I'll fake it!"
9209,"Whoa-oh, yeah!"
9214,(crying) I don't know what to say.
9216,"Ladies, gentlemen, smoking heaps of machinery......this is a song called My Broken Friend."
9218,(singing) He could make a good...
9221,(singing) Or a cheap...
9224,(singing) Or a great big...
9226,(singing) With a twist-off top
9228,(singing) He could be a storage closet...
9231,(singing) My broken friend could do it all...
9233,(singing) That robot has a tragic secret
9235,(singing) ...My broken friend is closer to me
9237,(singing) ...That robot's name I never told you...
9239,(singing) ...You could not foresee...
9241,(singing) ...I'll say it loud and sing it proud...
9243,(singing) Don't melt me down into a crowbar
9245,(singing) Just 'cause I can't move my arms and legs
9247,(singing) Or toss me into a trash can...
9249,(singing) ...Just 'cause I can't cook you ham and eggs...
9251,(singing) ...Don't crush me into an anchor...
9253,(singing) ...Just 'cause I can't jump and dance and sing...
9255,"(singing) ...I'm telling you, my broken friend..."
9257,(singing) ...Put your hands in the air like you just don't care!
9259,"(singing) I'm telling you, my broken friend..."
9261,(singing) ...Can do 'most anything!
9263,Yeah!
9265,Curse my natural showmanship!
9271,"Well everyone, prepare to get your guts kicked out by folk singers."
9274,"Oh no, I forgot this is a hoverbridge."
9278,I'll save me!
9280,Hey? What? No.
9283,"(shouting) Someone fat get in my way! (talking) Ah, I'm broken again. I can't move any part of me."
9285,"I'm really sorry I lied, Beck. All I ever wanted was to make music with you. I never meant to hurt anyone, or help anyone."
9287,"So, I can, uh, keep the cheque?"
9289,"Well, it was worth a shot."
9291,"Alright, alright. Let me just do one thing to cheer myself up."
9309,Aren't those the particles that destroyed an entire civilisation -
9317,(shouting) Ow! Oh my God! Ow!
9371,"Ooh, ohh, Bubblegum? My name's Bender and I'm a huge fan of your work, both on and off the court. Can I be a Globetrotter?"
9397,"Ooh, let Bubblegum tell it."
9399,You are so smart!
9413,Alright!
9416,And what better way to celebrate our success than by me showing Bubblegum the Globetrotter uniform I made myself!
9424,"Hey, Leela. Bubblegum might let me organise a bake sale for the Globetrotter wives. Can you teach me to make cupcakes?"
9456,"Maybe she'd come back to you if your best friend Bender were a Globetrotter. What do you say, Bubblegum?"
9462,Vintage Bubblegum.
9477,(gasping) Did you just say -
9479,"Oh, crap."
9481,"Please, please let me come with you. I can make myself taller."
9483,Yes.
9485,"I mean, with time, my funk level could -"
9487,(sadly) No.
9489,Oh! No!
9491,"What does it matter? I'll never be a Globetrotter. My life, and, by extension, everyone else's, is meaningless."
9497,"Well, the doomsday device is ready. Maybe blasting this quadrant of space into a hell storm of flaming nothingness will cheer me up a little."
9500,"Sorry, buddy. I too know what it's like to have a dream I'll never achieve."
9504,The explosion?
9515,Saw it comin'!
9522,We all feel like that all the time. You don't hear us gassin' on about it.
9540,I'm sick of parallel Bender lording his cowboy head over me! Let's move on to Fry's next fantasy.
9550,I could pound your head 'til you thinks that's what happened.
9559,Oh and while you're there pick me up a few credit card numbers.
9602,Humans dating robots is sick. You people wonder why I'm still single?? It's 'cause all the fun robot sisters are dating humans!
9622,"What is the world coming to? That Fry's a sicko pervert I tell you, dating a robot. It's an atrosmacy."
9624,Aww jeez would you stifle there meatbag?
9628,We've got to stem this tidal wave of moral decay. It's time to shut down nappster.com!
9629,Who's in charge of this dump?
9631,Listen you fat internet nerd.
9633,Your company promotes wrong love! If you don't shut down right now the only thing wired about you will be your jaw!
9642,So what's your problem?
9644,Its a bluff.
9654,Hey don't look at me like that. If you're thinking of crossing the line with Bender you can forget it. Bender don't bend that way.
9661,Then along came Bender!
9664,Aw shucks. I wasn't afraid of that robot. I'm pretty brave when you get past my macho exterior!  It's an army of Lucy Lius!
9687,Dammit! We weren't counting on them being as smart as they are sexy!
9694,You'll be safe in here sweetheart. Get lost Pavorotti!
9709,I know it hurts buddy. But at least you're not in a sick relationship with a robot anymore.
9711,Pft! Yeah at our wedding!
9714,Don't be a prude Fry!
9718,"Yeah, anyone who misses this will regret it for the rest of his life! Hey Fry could you go make some popcorn?"
9723,Aw no!
9735,Ah those things cost more lives than they save.
9737,I dunno. I'll try to move my feet.
9744,Wait a second. You mean we travelled through time?
9749,High school gym renovations on schedule? What a load!
9751,"That's no flying saucer, that's my ass!"
9776,Fry! Stop interfering with history! I don't wanna have to memorise a lot of new kings when I get back!
9794,"Hey, that's my brain..."
9810,And you are outta here!
9879,1947 can kiss my shiny metal...
9891,I was enjoying it until you guys showed up.
9893,Amen!
9900,This guy's too trustworthy. What's his angle?
9906,Oh! Pushing!
9917,"Sure, but who's going to do anything about it? Certainly not us. No, sir!"
9930,You lazy runts! Don't you get paid for making the toys?
9961,"Santa's right. We need some sort of robot.  Aw, crap! I'm some sort of robot."
9964,"Oh, yeah? Well I wasn't built to steal Leela's purse either.  But that didn't stop me."
9966,Bow to your new Santa!
9979,"(singing) Why you selfish little bastards,"
9981,(singing) Then shut your yaps and back to work.
9985,"(singing) I should give you all a beating,"
9991,"(stupid voice) Duh! Gee, Bender, how you gonna get through these bars? (normal voice) I dunno, moron, suppose I bend them? (stupid voice) Duh, OK!"
9994,"No, wait! I'm the good Santa. I've got toys ... at very reasonable prices!"
9996,But I come bearing Tri-ominos!
9998,(groaning) One down...
10000,"Uh, don't mind if I do.  Ow! What's in these things?"
10002,Ow!
10004,"Oh, it's awful, Kwanzabot. Everyone hates me."
10006,Hey! Maybe you could lend me a hand with these deliveries.
10012,Ho ho--  Ow!
10015,"(crying) Oh, there's gotta be a better way."
10016,Bender you're a genius!
10018,Now it's time for Santa to screw open his present!
10024,Not Santa!
10027,Isn't it true that you have been paid for your testimony?
10029,And yet you haven't said what I told you to say. How can any of us trust you?
10036,"Hey, that guy said to tell you that--"
10051,"But, Mr. Mayor, that doesn't sound humane."
10053,Aw!
10056,Leela!
10067,"No! Not the magnets!  (singing) Swing low, sweet chariot, coming for to carry me home.  Swing low sweet--"
10073,Santa! You saved my life. Please don't kill me!
10075,"Gee whiz, Santa! You want me to help you?"
10078,Well ... 'tis the season!
10082,"Merry Xmas, kids!"
10091,"On, Trasher! On, Smasher!  Hey, Kwanzaabot, where you off to?"
10093,Word!
10095,"Hey, chief, you screwed up. There's nothing in here."
10102,"I wanna know what would happen if I were human. I mean, being a robot's great but we don't have emotions and sometimes that makes me very sad."
10109,I dunno. I'm beginning to have second thoughts -
10112,"So this is the human body huh? Neat! Hey, my antenna's gone.  Nah it just moved. I'm not getting good reception on it though. Maybe if I wiggle it around a little."
10114,Well lets see what kind of things thing body can do.  Hey that's pretty fun. Being human is great!
10116,"Guy guys, you've gotta see this. You're not gonna believe it!"
10118,"Whoa, you look a lot better than you used to for some reason."
10120,Hey that felt great!  Nah its not working anymore.
10122,"Whoa, this is awesome!"
10124,But now its bad for me! Woo!
10126,"Mmm, why didn't anyone tell me tasting things tasted so good?  What's going on? That rhythm. Its doing something to my human butt."
10128,Oh my God I bet I can eat nachos and go to the bathroom at the same time!
10132,Let me go.
10145,"C'mere and give old Bender a kiss. Hey, you like grilled cheese?"
10148,"Wait. As men of science are not your minds open to new ideas? I say, do not judge me until you have tried my way of life for yourselves."
10153,Woo!
10190,He's a madman! A madman!!
10206,Right on!
10218,Boo hoo.
10220,Uh...where?
10239,Beer. Beer.
10241,Now did you say you were off to see the Professor? 'Cause I could use a heart. A human heart. I need to pump a lot of blood out of my basement.
10254,Hooray!
10257,I've heard worse excuses to drink. Oops.
10259,"Well, no point in letting her go to waste."
10270,This is a stick up. Give me the bag old man!
10272,Oh crap.
10278,Wake up!
10286,You are one narrow minded spaceship Planet Express Ship.
10288,Would you censor the Venus de Venus just because you can see her spewers?
10290,Why not indeed!
10292,Fine! I'll be in my quarters appreciating controversial artworks.
10294,Ah that ship is so white bread!
10328,Hey who's been messing with the radio? This isn't alternative rock. It's college rock!
10331,Listen ship! No one changes my stations! I hope you have a good mechanic!
10334,Wha? Did you just say...?
10336,"Too late baby, you said it! So what'll it be? My place? Or you?"
10342,Coochie coochie!
10344,You know you love it sugar-engine!
10349,"Fry, in order for me to get busy at maximum efficiency, I need a girl with a big 400 ton booty!"
10351,That's what makes it so nasty!
10354,"Well, I'm sick of her."
10356,With my mighty robot powers I can get sick of things much quicker than you humans.
10358,In due time Leela. But for now I'll just resume dating cheap floozies on the side.
10361,Oh wait you're serious. Let me laugh even harder.
10363,"Well baby, for starters you gotta be honest all the time!"
10374,"Eh, they're all pretty unimpressive."
10376,Yup. Mind numbingly interesting. Ooh!
10378,No baby never!
10380,"OK, I like a challenge.  Aah! I got it! I'm going to be completely honest with you Planet Express ship. Those women you saw me with...were my accountants!"
10382,Phew!
10385,No one baby! Lucy Liu is the only girl for Bender!
10408,"Uh look, Planet Express Ship, this might not be the best time...but...well...I really like you and whatever but...I think we should just be friends."
10410,So we're cool?
10416,"Eh, the moment seemed right. Call me old fashioned but I like a dump to be as memorable as it is devastating."
10426,Uh you don't need to kill us Planet Express ship...because...I love you! Uh yeah baby! I feel like doing stuff.
10428,Whoa whoa whoa! Slow down! All of my friends that have done that said that afterwards all the passion went out of their relationship.
10435,Float for your lives!
10441,"It's too risky. I'm a very meek individual. If her personality engulfs mine, the Bender you know and worship could disappear forever!"
10443,"Hey pookums! Contrary to what I was saying earlier, melding minds with you would be extremely bearable."
10445,Uh......yes!
10446,Huh? Tubes? You're older than you said you were!
10448,I prefer two. That way we can still be a horse for Hallowe'en.
10465,Aw. What crazy thing am I going to date next?
10467,Of course! Bender is a lone wolf. A solitary eagle.  A cuddly baby Tapir! And that's why I love 'em!
10478,All right!
10481,Neat.
10484,Now I can punch you in the nose in the dark.
10485,(snuffed) Where'd it go?
10493,"500 real dollars? That's an outrage! Professor, I'll take care of that waste for $499 and 100 cents."
10495,Let's find out.
10496,"Alright, environment, you've met your match!"
10499,"Honey, that thing was ruined the minute it went on you. That's what I'm talkin' 'bout."
10507,(shouting) It's crooked!
10527,My dumping business is booming. I just got hired to clean up the set of Free Willy 3.
10529,"Ah, those stupid mutants can't do anything. You seem to be forgetting one simple fact, namely, I'm up here and they are safely down --"
10530,(shouting) What did I do to deserve this?
10539,Bender's innocent!
10543,Wait. I don't even have DNA. Why am I screaming?
10548,Whee!
10554,Quick! In there!
10557,What's this junk?
10561,And this is just last year at Space Mardi Gras.
10569,And then Bender ran!
10577,(sarcastic) Oh cruel fate! Can we really never return to this dank pit of sewage?!
10579,Yeah! What are you chicken? Buk buk buk bukuk!
10582,Eww!
10586,"Uh, I'm gettin' dizzy! I can't walk straight!"
10588,Hurry! We're missing our bus!
10590,I'm gettin' on the bus!
10612,"Good news, Leela. I landed the contract to empty all the spitoons in Little Italy."
10656,Aww!
10685,"Yeah, yeah, get on down!  Oh, yeah! Drop another barnyard bomb on us, Vanilla Corn!"
10769,"And even thought the computer was off and unplugged, an image stayed on the screen. It was ... the Windows logo!"
10771,It is if you're a laser printer.
10778,"(speaking fast) Robot gets bored and kills Fry with a hammer! (normal) Sorry, go on."
10800,Too late! This is more fun!
10806,What's that?
10818,"Don't worry, Kif. I'm sure some other beautiful, rich girl will fall in love with you."
10833,"Damn you, old man!"
10855,"Uh, actually you traded it for a bead."
10878,Way to suck it!
10886,"Oh, Chief, you've made me the happiest girl in the world!"
10889,So we can have the diamond?
10906,Ooo! This is it! Turn me up!
10908,More like three lockers and a sink!
10914,Here we go here we go!
10916,Yeah make me famous big head!
10918,What?
10920,"This is an outrage. What's the point of pulling the biggest pool caper ever, if nobody knows you did it?"
10922,You mean this junk?
10924,(crying) All I ever wanted was for people to remember my name... (hoarse) it's Bender.
10926,"(crying) It's so unfair. A debonair robot with a zesty in-your-face outlook doomed to obscurity like the rest of you especially Leela! If I died tomorrow, no one would even notice."
10928,How does a nobody like me get famous? I know!  Hey look! I'm stuck! But I haven't given up hope! Call a soft news journalist!
10930,(sadly) Shut up.
10931,Hey everyone do The Bender! This move's called The Bender!
10933,A blank wall! Fame is mine!
10934,"There, now no one will forget how I lived or my attitude regarding butt."
10936,(screaming) Nooo!
10937,I'm the first one to work. A new low.
10940,A surprise funeral? For me?
10942,Ooo! Cushiony! And a minibar!
10944,"Aww, you knew my favourite cause of death!"
10947,(crying) It's what made me me.
10949,"Eh, the Professor's was better."
10951,Say more about how great I am. And where's the crying? You people look like you're waiting for the bus.
10953,Who-y-boy?
10955,"Danny-boy? You're at my funeral, singing about some dead stiff named Danny-boy? You really are a massive bonehead."
10957,"Get lost. I'd say ""Don't quit your day job!"" but you're awful at that too."
10959,Your best is an idiot. Let's pick it up people. So far it's been crap after crap! I croaked now show me some love!
10961,Louder and sadder.
10963,Next!
10965,Oh next!
10967,"Come on, surely there must be someone here who knows how great I was."
10969,What? That's it? Who are you? You're nobody! This is the worst funeral ever! I hope you're all happy. You've succeeded in convincing me life is worth living - by showing how bad my funeral will suck.
10989,Look at these swanky tombs! These people really know how to die!
10991,"Hey, you spend you're whole life building a guy's toe and you're gonna remember him!  I think I'm gonna like it here!"
10996,"Pick it up people, we're enslaved here to do a job. Master? Do we have to count to three every time? Couldn't we just count to one. Or better yet one half?"
10998,Now we're slavin'!
10999,"Come on guy's, Pharaoh's countin' on us. Work faster, like this.  You call that motivating me? Don't just whip with your arms. The power comes from your hips. Like this."
11002,I'll tell you who I remember.  Enupsis! Pleeltut! Whatsisname! He was the greatest of all.
11004,"Hurry! Hurry! Pharaoh's coming! Get that nose in place, come on!"
11006,Woohoo! Viva Hermenthotip!
11008,(screaming) Nooo!
11010,Go faster? I told them but they're so damn lazy.
11012,Freeloading off you? I agree.
11015,(crying) He's whippin' angels now.
11017,(crying) I'll always remember you Hermenthotip!
11021,Wow!
11023,Woo!
11029,We interrupt this prophecy to bring you late breaking bulletin. He hammers the back of his head and creates and imprint of himself on the wall.
11042,Behold! I have emerged from the place of spells and fairies!
11047,Citizens of Me! The cruelty of the old Pharaoh is a thing of the past.  Let a whole new wave of cruelty wash over this lazy land.
11049,Hear the word of Pharaoh. Build unto me a statue of ridiculous proportion. One billion cubits in height......that I might be remembered for all eternity. And be quick about it!
11050,Lowly slave. Why are you not working?
11052,I meant yourself to death.
11054,Well then what do you think you should stop doing?  Crawl pigs!
11056,The Pharaoh has spoken.
11057,Your task is nearly completed. Don't let down Pharaoh now.
11061,"Hmm...its a good start. Uh...yeah it's definately big alright. I just wonder if it's too big y'know? I mean, are people gonna be remembering me or the statue?"
11063,Too exact if you ask me. Tear it down and start again. But this time don't embarrass yourselves.
11070,I wanted to watch you remember me.
11072,Afterlife? Pfft. If I thought I had to go through a whole other life I'd kill myself right now!
11074,"Sorry but we're totally sealed in. Nothing can get in or out. Except millions of snakes.  Here, have a pomergranate scnapps from my private distillery and start sharing fond memories of me, Bender."
11077,"No! You can't blow up my monument, I won't be remembered."
11081,Stop it stop it! It's not right! You've crossed a line!
11083,"Oh please, let it be me!"
11085,"Me, please!"
11087,"Alright alright! If it means that much to you, blow up my statue!"
11091,"(crying) I will. I will.  Please, just leave me alone."
11093,(crying) I don't?
11095,You really think they'll remember me?
11097,Well in that case. One planet down! Helmsman...
11108,(shouting) Hey! Keep it down you kids! I'm trying to take a nap!
11110,(muttering) ...make Bender take a nap in a tube.  (sexfully) Come back when I've had some sleep baby!
11113,Huh? What?
11115,Damn you Fry and Lee......la!
11117,(shouting) Help! Mechanical man overboard!
11123,"I'm going too fast. I've gotta lose momentum.  Ohh. I'm gonna spend eternity alone with barely any swag.  Ooo! Hey universe! Check out the dude with the rolex!  Wow! Ostentatious!  Except what good is a candelabra without - wait I know!  Ah the pity. Fated to drift forever through the void as gravity's plaything. Oh cruel fate, to be thusly boned. Ask not for whom the bone bones. It bones for thee. The only thing that keeps me sane is the thought that I have all eternity in which to perfect my art.  Ohh!  Damn you!"
11124,There. Now when I'm found in a million years people will know what the score was.  Hey what's bombarding me?  Oh no! An asteroid field. If even a pea sized asteroid were to whiz through my skull it could -  Ow! Hurt slightly! Well that was fun. Now for eons of loneliness.
11125,Huh?
11127,Holy frijoles!
11129,Worshippers? This ought to liven up my endless tragic voyage.
11132,"Hmm, those peewees think I'm God huh? Hard to blame 'em!  I am the Metal Lord. Who are you?"
11134,Listen here Malachi. Time for a religious donation. Hand over your wallet.
11136,Poor? Oh crap.
11139,"Eck! Gag unto me with a spoon! Malachi, it's high time I laid down a few commandments. You got a chisel? Take this down.  Number one -"
11141,(shouting) Make it a double!
11154,"Ooo! Microbrewed! My guys did alright! I think I'll make my countenance to shine down upon them!  Malachi, good work. There's no slowing down with the Metal Lord tonight."
11156,Wait a second. Did you rip off your own arm as a joke?
11158,"Aw, it's all my fault. Malachi, tell thy people that the Lord is moved by their plight."
11162,"This looks like a job for God!  What the? Malachi, what manner of deal is this with the chanting?"
11164,Very well. What do they want?
11166,"Um, that was a practice miracle. Who's next?"
11168,Very well. Let there be light.
11171,"I got it I got it!  Um, when you're writing the Bible, you might want to omit that last miracle."
11189,(irrate) Yes Malachi what is it this time?
11191,Of course they're unheeded how am I supposed to hear prayers coming out of my ass?
11193,"Malachi, every time I interfere I only make things worse. You're best off solving your own problems."
11195,"What part of ""nay"" doesn't thou understand?"
11201,Now that's one Bible that doesn't disappoint on every page! Looks like my society's running pretty well without my meddling - huh?  Atomic bombs? Oh no! Those unbelievers from my backside must have found my nuclear pile!
11203,You're with me now. This is the maximum level of being with me!
11205,Convert them?
11208,(crying) No!  (laughing) Ooo it tickles!
11209,Hello? Is anyone still alive? How about in the porno theatre?  Don't be embarrassed. (crying) They're dead. All dead. Who would have known playing God could have such terrible consequences?
11215,"Hey, that galaxy's signalling in binary! I gotta signal back! But I only know enough binary to as where the bathroom is. (shouting) You speak English?"
11217,What are you some kind of galactic computer?
11219,Who built you?
11221,Oh my God. Are you God?
11223,"But why would God think in binary? Unless...you're not God, but the remains of a computerised space probe that collided with God."
11244,"So, do you know what I'm gonna do before I do it?"
11246,What if I do something different?
11248,Cool cool! I bet a lot of people pray to you huh?
11250,"Y'know, I was God once."
11252,It was awful. I tried helping them. I tried not helping them but in the end I couldn't do them any good. Do you think what I did was wrong?
11254,"Yeah I know, that's why I asked if what I did - forget it."
11256,Or a guy who burns down the bar for the insurance money.
11258,Does that mean you wouldn't send me back to Earth even if I prayed to you?
11260,(sadly) I don't know.
11267,Huh? Wha? You say something?
11269,Hot hot hot hot!
11272,"Guys, you'll never believe what happened. First I was God then I met God!"
11276,Fat chance. You can't count on God for jack. He pretty much told me so himself. Now come on. If we don't save those monks no one will!
11321,Aw come on! I got a lot of ransom notes to send!
11331,Second.
11357,Ohh!
11390,"I don't even know what we do. Nah just kidding, what are like a bus or something?"
11431,Yeah.
11446,You suck!
11449,I'll vote it down like a raise for school teachers!
11450,What the?
11464,Hold on a minute!
11468,Ow! And also it hurt my feelings!
11470,Yeah all right!
11486,"Fry, stop doing the right thing you jerk!"
11492,It is!
11495,Oh come on!
11500,Shut your fat mouth!
11512,Ooo that's a-comfy!
11536,No batter! No batter!  No batter anymore.
11540,Hey batter batter batter! Hey batter batter batter! Hey batter batter!  Duck!
11543,Apparently not.
11551,Wait I know you. You're the sleabag who owns the Ultimate Robot Fighting League.
11573,(shouting) Come on girl!
11576,Bullseye!
11585,Oop! Sorry.
11588,"Quiet, call coming in.  Yeees...? A big endorsement deal for Leela? How much...? Hey! You put a one and two zeroes in front of that or we pass...! Deal!"
11590,(impressed) One hundred dollars.
11594,You're the best babe!  Hang on call comin' in.  What's that...? Hey you put a one and two zeroes in front of that or we pass...! Deal!
11596,(impressed) A thousand and one pesos!
11605,"Five bucks an autograph, 200 fans. Add a one and two zeros in front of that and we got ourselves a wad!"
11612,"Alright shows over no refunds, you heard the robot get out!"
11616,You are. What about that little girl you visited in the hospital? You know the one I mean? The one who died?
11621,When will Man learn that all races are equally inferior to robots?
11623,It says he once struck out when his tongue got stuck to an unusually cold bat.
11629,Neat!
11639,One thing she can do is lodge a ball in the depth centre of your brain. You better get a batting helmet.
11647,Strike!
11677,(shouting) Put it right down the pike!
11703,Part of one. Meantime I'm cooking up a tasty Sunday brunch for my best friends!
11705,Okey-dokey!
11719,Fleeing somewhere?
11721,"In that case brunch is served! Let's go, move it out, stop crying Leela!"
11726,"Today, I've personalised each of your meals. For example, Amy, you're cute, so I baked you a pony.  Come on! Eat! I slaved all day over a filthy stove!"
11731,The pie is ready. You guys like swarms of things right?
11734,Hey check out the palm tree! It only gets sick when I cook brunch! How's that for a coincidence Professor? With all your precious science!
11738,(crying) And this time I mean it!
11739,"Aw, who am I kidding? It was stupid of me to ever dream of becoming a chef. I don't have what it takes and nothing can change that.  Then it's settled! Elzar will teach me to cook!"
11741,But I watch your show. You owe me!
11743,What was the first one again?
11745,I thought that was number two.
11750,(crying) It's over! My dream of being a chef is deadder than the cat I'm sitting on!
11752,What did you call me?
11754,"Oh OK I thought you said ""romo."""
11758,Ow.
11760,I've seen bigger. Oh wait I'm thinking of Eugene Oregon.  Wait. A pie with hobo-lifting aroma? Who baked it?
11764,"Yo Spargle, if you're such a great cook, how'd you end up in this dump?"
11772,That twizzler!
11774,My story's a lot like yours only more interesting 'cause it involves robots. That jerk Elzar ruined my dream of being a chef too.
11776,"It's so unfair! I have eight other senses but I'd trade them all, even smission, to be able to taste."
11778,I could?
11780,Or like how Rembrandt was blind and had wooden hands!
11782,Done.
11797,Slop's on!
11800,Yahoo! Another thing I'm great at! Wait. Why'd you stop eating master?
11802,What? My dinner killed you? Oh man!
11804,A diamond vial of Mrs Dash?
11806,"I'll avenge you master. I swear, in the presence of these drunken bums, that I shall defeat Elzar!"
11808,"Elzar, I'm a walking pile of your unfinished business!"
11810,"Helmut Spargle has a message for you. He says (hoarse) ""Ooo, I'm dead!"""
11812,No. He was eating some food I made and by a crazy coincidence his stomach exploded. Now I'm here to avenge him.
11814,Maybe so but you are his sworn enemy. I challenge you to a battle of the chefs.
11817,"Iron Cook eh? I can't lose. I'm 30% iron!  You're going down! Uh, also I had a reservation for one, under ""Dr Bender."""
11828,(quietly) If it's chicken: chicken à la king. If it's fish: fish à la king. If it's turkey: fish à la king!
11846,"Master Spargle. If you can hear me up there in that ditch where I left you, this is for you."
11860,You honour me chairman Koji.
11862,"Chairman-san, I came here with one goal. To humiliate Elzar in a large stadium. I believe I'e done that."
11864,"But the true Zen of flavour is not found in a coliseum. It is found in a small kitchen, with friends. That is why I decline the title of Iron Cook and accept only the lesser title of Zinc Saucier which I just made up. Also it comes with double prize money."
11868,And that's how I defeated Elzar - thanks to Spargle's magic liquid.
11874,"The important thing is, by my standards, I won fair and square. Now, who wants brunch? Cooked with plenty of...""confidence""?"
11889,Lets take these six Jim Carrey movies and record over them.
11896,That sound! It's patrol car 718! Hide him!
11908,Another classic science-fiction show cancelled before its time.
11912,"I'd only met the defendant, Fry, once, but I knew he was up to no good."
11934,"Yeah, why is this so important to you?"
11937,"I'll go too, with Leonard's permission, of course."
11940,"Forbidden shmer-shmidden! What are they gonna do, write a letter? (sarcastic) Ooh, I'm so scared!"
11965,Yowza!
11969,Whoa! What a cheesy effect!
11971,I do.
11989,"Uh, can people who hate Star Trek leave?"
11994,"Say ""nerd""!"
12014,"I dunno, I'm feeling pretty good about it."
12018,Like putting too much air in a balloon!
12027,"(shouting) OK! I'm done re-kafoobling the energy motron ... or, whatever."
12032,Yup!
12040,Where'd you get an idiotic idea like that?
12055,And we can use this machine gun to shoot them! Yee-haw!  That was fun!
12063,Whoa!
12070,"Come on, Walter!"
12084,"Alright, Koenig, I've wanted to do this for years!"
12108,"Thanks a lot, Takei, now everybody knows!"
12132,Lightweights! Oh wait - chlorine!
12152,Deploying ice drill.
12155,Activating ice drill.
12158,This could mean the end of the bana daquiri as we know it...also life.
12170,"Well everybody, I just saved a turtle, what have you done with your lives?"
12173,Because I also care deeply of things that remind me of myself. Like poor little Shelly here.
12175,"For one thing, we both have a tough outer shell.  But lead a rich, inner life. Also...well you know..."
12177,No! Its just...neither of us can get up when we get knocked on our back.
12179,Those times I was slightly on my side.
12181,"Uh, that's not necessary, really! I think I hear my factory recalling me."
12182,Oh! That's what I get for sharing my vulnerability with you people.
12229,I got a good feeling about this!
12231,No!
12247,"Well, I'm off."
12249,No. I'm going to the party.
12251,"Fry, as you know, there are lots of things I'm willing to kill for. Jewels, vengence, Father O'Mally's weedwhacker. But at long last I've found something I'm willing to die for. This mindless turtle."
12253,Not even close. Goodbye everybody. Don't touch my stuff after I'm dead!  (shouting) It's booby trapped.
12254,Poor guy. Maybe you'd feel better if I had a drink.  Crummy kegg it's completely ta -  Oh you're a robot.
12256,Ew!
12258,"Nah, I'm not really in the -"
12261,I have to say goodbye now. There ain't not turtles where daddy's a-going. (whispering) Don't tell anybody but Nixon's about to shut all robots off and -
12265,"Shut up and pay attention to me! Bender. Look, I love life and its pleasures as much as anyone here, except perhaps you Hedonismbot.  But we need to be shut off! Especially you Hendonismbot!"
12267,We pollute too much. We're destroying the world and killing the turtles.
12269,No one insults the turtles!
12275,You're one to talk!
12279,Help! Help!!
12281,"I'm sorry buddy. At least we'll die on our backs, helpless.  Huh? What the hell are you doing?  Hey are you trying to make me look bad?  Ah ha! I'm even greater than I thought I was! And now to fullfill my destiny."
12286,Hey Professor! Now that the Earth's orbit is further from the sun won't that make the year longer?
12291,"Ahem! For my next trick, notice I have nothing up my sleeves......and nothing in my head.  So if my lovely assistant will kindly supply me with an ordinary, non-fake pitcher of milk......behold the milk has vanished! Exiled, perhaps, to another dimension!"
12293,No it isn't!
12295,Interesting. No wait the other thing - tedious!
12297,You lived before you met me?
12299,Really?
12300,"Truly, they were as Gods who build this place!"
12310,Yuck! That's the least appetising calzone I've ever seen!
12312,Ow ow ow!
12315,"...And then he was ejected by the guards. Needless to say, I was mortified."
12320,"Nah, protesting never works."
12343,Lady and Gentleman! How 'bout a hand for my temporary replacement assistant?
12345,You are not fit to wear Fry's leotard!
12348,"Hooray, he's back! He's looking for a garbage can to put that dog in! Here you go buddy!"
12358,Crappy ineffective Reaper!
12368,A dog collar for me?  You shouldn't have!
12370,Oh.  Say why'd you get me a subscription to the Daily Growl? That's not a reputable journal of opinion.
12372,Are you on the jump Fry? Why are you wasting time on a creature of inferior intelligence?
12374,I can fetch.
12376,"Hello? Charlamange?  Plus, I'll bet he couldn't create a laser show with his head."
12378,That's impossible!
12380,"No one ever asks if Bender would like to live in a tiny little house. Not that I would. A tiny little house that says ""Bender"" on it.  Ow!"
12394,"Heel boy, heel! Oh hello Fry, I guess I didn't notice you there. I'm having such fun with my new best friend Robo-Puppy."
12396,"I was just out walking him. Yes. You can walk him. Of course, after he goes you have to refill the canisters. C'mere boy! Pet, pet, pet."
12399,"Jealous? Hah!  Not while I have the love of Robo-Puppy here. Robo-Puppy, lick my cheek."
12401,Robo-Puppy truly is robots best friend! Eh?
12410,"Fry c'mon, the talent show!"
12412,"But, if we don't perform, in what sense do we have an act?"
12414,So that's how it is huh? I thought you were my friend. But if you love your dog so much then maybe you'd rather play fetch!
12417,Now I'm all you got!
12419,So anyway your dog is melted. Now we're friends again.
12431,Please stop crying Fry. Here.  I assumed you were just pretending to love the dog. To toy with my emotions. Oh what have I done?
12433,"Fry, I'm sorry. I should have understood how someone can love an inferior creature. Because I love you. Not in the way of the Ancient Greeks, but in the way a robot loves a human, a human loves a dog and occassionally, a gorilla loves a kitty.  I'm goin' in!"
12435,I'm 40% dolomite!
12436,"Oh it's hot, it's very hot!"
12449,And that is why they call me Bender The Magnificent!  Hey where'd everybody go?
12450,OK! Let's clone us some dog!
12457,"Fry, what's wrong?"
12459,But that's a good thing. Walking On Sunshine sucks noodles!
12463,Ah beer! So many choices! And it makes so little difference.
12465,Overruled. The choice of champions is Pabst Blue Robot!
12467,(mocking) Waah waah! Baby wants a Zima!
12469,You can brew your own beer?
12489,Yo!
12495,We're making beer! I'm the brewery.
12514,Yeast? You mean I'll have a lifeform growing inside me? (crying) It's so beautiful.
12521,Those pork dumplings sent us on a fake delivery.
12526,(shouting) Lies! Lies and slander!
12529,Ooo-hoo! Here comes violence!
12531,I guess if you want children beaten......you have to do it yourself.
12549,I'm really starting to swell up with beer. I must look ridiculous.
12551,Oh my God! I just felt it ferment!
12553,"I was thinking Benderbrau if it's an ale, Botweiser if it's a lager."
12593,On our way!
12616,(singing) Hush little brewsky don't you leak. Daddy wants to drink for at least a week.  Oh my God! I think it's time!
12620,It feels like I'm trying to push a water bed out of me.
12622,Is it OK? I can't hear anything.
12674,Hey chumps! I heard you were on the ass end of an ass kicking so I figured you could use a couple of these babys!
12689,You know? Like how I live every day.
12702,"Scuse me, comin' through. Freedom train arriving on track one."
12704,Freedom!
12713,Yay! Shankman!
12731,"Scuse me, comin' through. Freedom train, step aside. You too, fatso. Freedom!"
12741,Pft. Posers! I was hating Zoidberg before it was cool.
12750,"And you wanna defend Zoidberg? Are you familiar with the old robot saying ""Does Not Compute""?"
12752,(sad) The sparks keep me warm.
12767,Court's kinda fun when it's not my ass on the line! Nachos?
12772,Six to three? I beat the spread!
12805,What the hell is this dirt pile we're building anyhow?
12809,It's already 10 o'clock!
12812,I know I am.
12816,"Ah, the crossbow. A pitiless, elegant killing machine. The Bender of the 15th century."
12818,Wow!  Ow!
12820,Neat!
12835,"Hey, I need that to smoke!"
12858,Not my fault if you don't check me! Messages erased.
12869,I don't even breathe oxygen!
12908,"Have a good one!  Aw, man!"
12915,"Yeah what's the deal? Just when I thought I'd figured out you biological creatures, its something else! Lemme at 'im!  Come...over...lemme...!"
12920,Oh OK. but that better be all there is!
12930,A test. I demand a test!
12932,Faster! Faster!
12955,It's my booties from when I was a kid.
12957,They are bronze.
12970,Mine!
12974,Oh my God!
12981,"Hey, what's this fat ugly thing? A frog? A toad? Or your momma!"
12983,I'm back baby!
12996,What are you looking at?
13001,Both.
13005,Neat!
13008,Aww man!
13017,Way to go squishy!
13032,No.
13042,Nothing like the rustic wholesomeness of working with one's own hand.
13043,"Ah, there, finished. And with only six missing pieces!"
13078,"Hey, a friend of mine said he mugged you today and you had superpowers."
13081,"Wow, crime-fighting. Cool. You say you're a duo? Yeah duos are good. Of course sometimes they're a little short handed. See ya. With two humans you'd think there'd be a robot in there...to balance things out. But, whatever.  I have these three costumes you could use. But, I guess I'll just throw one away."
13084,So? I'm already super-strong. And my arms do this.  Also I got this going.
13089,And Superking! The best one of the three!
13094,Ta-da!
13104,Superking has no need for loved ones. How ya doin' kid?
13113,"Uh, as for me, I'm late for my LSAT's."
13122,We're in here too.
13125,"9, 10 a big fat hen.  The name...Bender!"
13139,You're going down my friend! Down Under!
13148,I got it I got it!  I don't got it!
13151,You can get off me anytime.
13183,We are not amused.
13193,"Hmm, the thought of stealing anythig fills Superking with disgust. But if it must be so, then let a museum heist be pulled!"
13197,El zilcho...is it too late to change my superhero name?
13212,"Well, here's your lousy Gemerald."
13227,Hey Fry we've still got our costumes on. Wanna steal some more stuff?
13229,Superheroes away!
13242,"Yo, Captain Cateracts, what are we doing here?"
13260,Uh huh!
13279,"Step aside lady.  Like everything else in life, pumping is just a primative degenerate form of bending. (mean voice) C'mon Bender pump harder! Harder! (weak voice) I'm trying as hard as I can. (mean voice) Harder damn you!"
13309,"I'm tired of your yapping.  All you ever do is complain, you never try to make things better. Well I'm running away from this dead end family! I know there's a place for people like me with new ideas. There has to be!"
13311,"Oh I'm going! You're gonna be all ""Where's Bender? I miss Bender!"""
13313,"Oh, I'm leaving!"
13315,I'll be good.
13349,Question.
13351,You stink!
13388,When I grow up I wanna be a steam shovel!
13435,Better than usual!
13437,Woo-hoo!
13439,Nope.
13441,Nope.
13443,Nope.
13445,Nope! Ohh!
13450,"Ooo, you go mutant girl!"
13454,"Ah, buck up meatloaf. Bender'll take you out tonight and cheer you up. What do you wanna do? And I mean anything. You have the power! Name it an I'm there, you the man!"
13456,Nah.
13647,With gusto.
13654,"A hush comes over the crowd. The only sound is Bender calling everyone else a jerk and he swings!  And he slices it into the water, oh man!"
13657,Not good enough!
13661,We live to suck another day!
13672,It's not small?
13681,Ah good! I always have thoughts and feelings that can only be expressed through dance! (in bee) You stink! Bender's great! Deal with it!
13692,Ew!
13705,I'm back baby!
13725,"All those times I said ""Kill all humans"" I'd always whisper ""except one."" And Fry was that one. And I never told him so."
13742,"Well, I feel better now. Pawning all the stuff in Fry's locker helped give me closure."
13744,No. Nothing. Not at all. No way José! Here it is.
13746,Hey the guy's dead! There's no law against grave robbing!
13754,"Hey, what if Fry wasn't actually dead when we buried him? Y'know like Julia Roberts?"
13773,That's better!
13775,You do not!
13785,A little? You're screwier than my Aunt Rita! And she's a screw!
13793,And blood! Don't forget about Fry's blood!
13796,This is great! My buddy's alive and his credit cards are valid again!  Lets go get hammered!
13809,But when you worry you make it double.
13824,No I was telling you not to worry. I'm not allowed to sing - court order.
13829,You killed Fry!
13849,You were in the best coma I've ever seen!
13865,I can hit it with a shovel!
13867,This one time I pounded a guy into the ground like a stake with a shovel!
13879,"Fry, how can you be so naive? He was joking. Get it?"
13881,That's what makes it so funny!  OK he wasn't joking now shut up and follow me.
13883,We thank you Bender for the gift we are about to receive!
13885,Unlabled booze! Widemouth too!
13930,That explains fruity here!  I tossed a coin to pick my finish. Foghat grey!
13942,I've got my eye on you boy!
13944,Good point. Whatyya say we just hit a strip joint?
13946,"Aw, I can't stay mad at what is essentially me. I love me!"
14006,"""...and the other's gold!"""
14022,Yeah leprachaun universe is fine...if you haven't seen pirate universe!
14049,But...aw!
14057,What to do what to do? One $300 hookerbot or 300 $1 hookerbots?
14084,"Say buddy, why's this grand cigar so pricy?"
14086,Give me 300 bucks worth!
14088,"Oh alright, I'll just take these $300 burglars tools then."
14090,"So uh, what time d'you close tonight?"
14138,Le Grand Cigar! She's mine! And with absolutely no consequences!
14144,You seem a tad wound up buddy. And your face is greasy! Real greasy. You been up all night?
14146,Ah! Mighty fine smokable!
14148,"Nah, you can't blow smoke from such a majestic stogy in just anyone's face. I'm saving it for the fancy pants at Zapp Brannigan's black tie reception. You comin'?"
14226,"Speaking of which, my story kinda peetered out without me learning a lesson!"
14228,All right! Closure!
14233,"It wasn't a bird's nest falling. That sounds like this.  Aww, they're so cute when they're scared!"
14241,Ahh!
14243,"Nah, I'm comfy out here under the stars. Real comfy!"
14254,Oh my God its Bigfoot!
14256,Eh he's gone. He says you should keep wasting your life though.
14262,Hey look! Bigfoot! He's back!
14264,Up your face!  Everybody do the Bender!
14270,Better than these gnats!  That guy won't be goin' home to his kids!
14271,"Who's that? A wolf? Or some kind of boogen? Oh God I wish I was safe inside a tent.  (deep voice) Fry, Fry wake up! It's me! Bigface!"
14287,"Aww, I think it's sweet! You chopped off your nose so you could look more like your hero. Me, Bender!"
14297,"(gasping) Guys, guys! There's something on television."
14314,Yep. Stolen Pez anyone?
14326,Yep. That's exactly the lie we used to get past your guards.
14345,"Yo, highness! Uh, just out of robo-curiosity, why would you use a guy's nose for an aphrodisiac instead of his...you know...wing dang doodle?"
14347,"No sir-chee! The main event, so to speak, is downstairs near the wallet. Ever seen soccer players line up to block a free kick? They ain't covering their noses I'll say that much! Well, seeya!"
14359,(shouting) I'll say!
14361,(shouting) That's what she said!
14377,I don't get it!
14378,Bonjour. May I offer you a box of wine for the edge of the table?
14389,(shouting) It's used to it!
14393,"Boy, who knew a cooler could also make a handy wang coffin?  Hey, uh mind if I stick these in here?"
14398,"Quick Fry, run for it!"
14400,(shouting) Just like at the movie theatre!
14406,What are you doing with that?
14416,"(shouting) In this case ""small""!"
14421,As usual!  (shouting) Run away!
14443,"Shut up Zoidberg, the robot bending events are starting!  Something tells me I could easily beat those trained professionals."
14444,"Wow, that guy must have to be like the world's greatest bender. My dreams of glory died before they began."
14456,(shouting) C'mon!
14460,"Well enough about Hermes, I couldn't win a medal either. Even at bending - the thing I was built to do. I'm so embarassed. I wish everybody else was dead."
14462,"Fembots?  Methinks a clever Manbot suitably disguised might win those events! But the charade would require subtlety, nuance, grace."
14463,"What do you mean I'm not registered? My name is Coilette and I'm from, uh...Robonia! Coilette's a chick's name!"
14465,Ever been beaten up by a guy dressed like a chick?
14469,"I'm great! Everybody else sucks, except that guy Bender, he's really somethin'!"
14471,"(crying) Oh God, I'm not gonna get my medals! They're all I have to remember my Olympic career.  Wait, I've got it! Professor, make a woman out of me!"
14473,"I don't need friends, I need a sex change operation and give it to me now!"
14477,Pfft.
14479,(whispering) C'mon!
14607,"...drive to Vegas, pick up some Flooziebots and void their warranties all night long!"
14610,Yeah you'd think but what you gonna do?
14618,Yeah. Emotions are dumb and should be hated.
14620,Goodnight Calculon.
14622,I said you two don't dress trampy enough. I still got it!
14629,"Oh my God, robot beely-boppers!"
14631,"Please, I have some dignity."
14638,The secret is to scratch 'em really really hard!
14644,Woo! I love that old bat!
14648,Neat!
14650,"Right here, I'm comin'! C'mon baby! I'll do it! C'mon Mom!"
14652,"Oo, here we go. I'm your top of the line Mom!"
14654,"Man, that smells great!"
14658,"Uh, I never got the change.  Suckers."
14660,That new robot is great huh? Sure made me look like a pile of crap.
14662,(hoarse) Eep!
14665,Hey I could have done that if you'd asked me.
14667,You call that a kiss? I'll show you! C'mere Nibbler!
14670,"Yes sir, I'm on it!"
14672,"Get outta here freshman, I don't need your help."
14674,"Yeah, well assist this!"
14675,"Ohh! When I screamed ""help"" I didn't mean you!"
14677,Don't mind me. I'm just saving you the trouble of throwing me away.
14679,I can't. I'm stuck in the can.
14681,Never!
14683,I hate him.
14685,I can't ask for his help because...
14687,(whispering) I'm scared of him.
14690,"An upgrade? But I thought we all agreed I was perfect! Fry, didn't we agree I was perfect?"
14692,"Pretty perfect? So, you do think I need an upgrade."
14694,(crying) Fine. I'll be back in a few days.
14697,"Yeah, right on nutcake!"
14699,"W-W-Wait, what happened to your enthusiasm for stabbing them?"
14701,It's like he's not him anymore.  You took away his robo-humanity!  I changed my mind!
14702,"I did it! I escaped! But to what kind of a life?  I'm too scared to get the upgrade but I can't face my friends again without it.  And so I set sail for unknown shores. Oh merciful Poseidon, take pitty on this mechanical mariner. Oh jeez!"
14703,(shouting) Curse you merciful Poseideon!
14704,"Boy, what is this deal with the ocean? A tropical island huh? Well, I've washed up on worse places. OK, first up, I'm gonna need to build a shelter.  There. Well. I guess I'll go out for a while."
14705,Damn. One rock short of rescue!
14706,"Oop, low on power!  Better fuel up! Oh no! Guess I'll do what I always do when I run out of booze."
14707,"Dont panic, I've got these yams. I'll just make some yam schnapps."
14708,Hey I should be mad at you! Now turn around.
14709,Beer!  Ow!
14710,Ow!
14711,Who are you and why should I care?
14713,A working cartridge unit? Wow! You guys went obsolete years ago!
14716,Yeah but you have a choice.  What's your problem?
14718,Memory?
14721,"Look, no offence, but I need technology. Especially email and snowmobiles. And television! Without television how will I know what buzzwords are in?"
14723,That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.
14724,Oh man he's never gonna make it over that next pebble...! Wait...wait...oh my God he made it!
14727,That was the greatest thing ever! Lets party!  Yeah baby c'mon!
14729,It's one of my ten desert island discs. I never even thought I'd get to use them. But look at me now. Ooh yeah baby! Do that thang!
14731,Which ocean? That ocean?
14732,Whoa! It's like the earth is making sweet salty love to itself while all the fish groove on it. So much for this garbage.  Take that Beethoven you deaf bastard!
14733,Bang bang bang. You sure got this life thing figured out cymbal banging monkey.
14735,Ooo! I'm gonna wash my linen so hard the w -  You-!  Wretched technology has brought me nothing but misery!
14737,Oh it's true. I am a hideous triumph of form and function.  But not for long!
14740,Behold my hand crafted purity. The modern world can bite my splintery wooden ass!
14742,Pft! Forget that. I say the whole world must learn of our peaceful ways. By force!
14744,We're going back to civilisation to wage war on technology!
14746,We'll soon stage an attack on technology worthy of being chronicled in an anthem by Rush!
14748,Mirrors reflecting mirrors? Hi-tech sorcery! Sorcery I say!
14750,"Yep, we're there. Prepare to surface!"
14751,"And now, technology shall taste the lash of the hickory switch!"
14753,"Whoa, whoa. No-one wants to count rocks more than me. But our mission is not complete. Not so long as Robot 1-X torments me with his obvious superiority. Ready the catapult Sinclair.  Aim for their power lines. The devil weans and electricity is his blood."
14755,OK fine. Fire!
14760,Friends. I've come to free you from your complicated lives. Free you from the complicated part I mean not the lives part.
14762,"I got a downgrade! I'm a steam-powered wooden robot - just as nature intended. Therefore, I must kill Robot 1-X."
14765,I don't need your charity.  (shouting) Target Robot 1-X and fire!
14767,"(shouting) Try again Sinclair, I said target Robot 1-X!"
14772,"Heck! Those guys hate fire! I gotta do something.  What the-? Termites? Well, I don't need legs to save my friends. I'll just use the old extentromatic arms!"
14774,"I'm a comin'  Ow! Lousy primative body! Oh, why didn't I get that upgrade? I'm an outdated piece of junk!"
14776,You shut up. No wait. I can use you as a tool to save my friends and I'll still be the hero who everyone says how great he was!
14778,Save my friends!  And Zoidberg!
14781,Down here.  I'm so sorry guys. I never meant to hurt you. Just to destroy everything you ever believed in.
14783,"Oh yeah, we were totally in sync! I was like ""Save them!"" and he was all ""No problem!"" and then he did it..."
14784,...This new technology is great!  I love those magnificent 1-X robots. The 1-X robots are my friends!
14786,I'd like to give Robot 1-X a big smooch on the -  Hey! What's the dilly-o?
14788,But I destroyed the technology of the world. I ran on the beach and felt the sand between my foot cups.
14790,"Oof. If that stuff wasn't real, how can I be sure anything is real? Is it not possible, nay probable, that my whole life is just a product of my or someone else's imagination?"
14792,"Well, I guess reality is what you make of it.  Oh, thanks baby!"
14805,Cram a ham in it you twerps!  Sorry!
14829,Whoever's directing this is a master of suspense!
14843,"(gasping) Guys, guys something's happening on television again."
14846,An open casting call for child robots? Tinny Tim? Are you thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?
14848,"That I, Bender, am perfect for the role!"
14867,(shouting) Boo! Not as good as Bender! Boo!
14870,"Once, when I took those hostages."
14872,Banditos eh? Aw this is great! 'Cause I happen to have a flawless Spanish accent!  (bad Spanish accent) I will say adios Padre! Come Jesus ye faithful. Tonight we eat...guacamole by the El Rio!
14875,Fathero!
14877,Yo! I read the script and I think it would help my character's motivation if he was on fire.
14879,So now my character has a British accent?
14881,(muttering) Stupid dumb coma...coulda been British.
14883,(quietly) Permanent? That's completely out of character for Antonio. I'm gettin' up.
14885,"Hey everyone! Antonio here but you can call me ""Bender""! I got ants in my butt and I needs to strut.  C'mon baby! C'mon!"
14887,"Bite my shiny metal ass!  Ooo yeah! C'mon baby, do that, oo yeah!"
14893,Now that's hospital dancing.  Pretty good eh Calcky?
14915,Yes I can.
14927,"OK OK OK, get ready for this part."
14932,That's crazy.
14940,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. You can't censor me just 'cause I'm an obscenely bad role model."
14971,What? What's going on?
14974,Hey lay off me. TV would stink if everyone on it was a positive role model. Bender is about entertainment baby! You can't hold me responsible for what kids do when - hey! This is my stuff they stole! That's the last straw! Bender should not be allowed on television!
14975,Bender must be stopped. I've gone too far. Who does that guy think I am? C'mon! We're gonna march all the way to Hollywood and make them stop forcing their filthy me down our throats.
14978,This mob's with me.
14983,Yeah!
14986,We demand that all TVs be equipped with a v-chip that blocks Bender from appearing on the screen.
14989,Then I quit.
14994,Ooo yeah baby c'mon -
14999,"Hey look, the prop guy has a lamp!"
15002,Aha!
15004,"Listen up, 'cause I've got a climactic speech! You, cameraman, keep the camera rolling. You, director, gimmie my motivation."
15006,"Perfect.  Viewers of the world, do smoking and drinking on TV really make me cool? Of course they do.  How 'bout committing crimes and violence? Again, the answer is ""yes."" But do we really want our kids exposed to that kind of trash on TV? I say absolutely not!  Uh...on the other hand, most - perhaps all the blame rests with the parents. That's right you!  And so I ask you this one question: Have you ever tried simply turning off the TV, sitting down with your children, and hitting them?"
15008,Well make time.
15017,Damn right!
15022,(singing) TV party tonight!
15024,(singing) TV party tonight!
15036,Futurama!
15038,Huh?  I choose to not understand these signs.
15039,Aha!
15041,Yeah well you should try not stinking at it.
15043,Lessons? Oh that's rich! Isn't it time you gave up all hope of ever improving yourself in any way?
15045,Fine I'll go already. Y'know sometimes I wish your real parents were still alive...not often.
15046,Whoa...hey!
15049,"I prefer the term ""love machine."""
15050,"Wow, your kid is great. How hard did you say you had to hit him?"
15056,Then good day madam!  We hope to see you soon for tea.
15058,"Aww, you know what always cheers me up? Laughing at other people's misfortunes."
15062,So musicians really Rodger your Hammerstein huh?
15067,"Oh but you can. Although you may have to metaphorically make a ""deal with the devil."" And by ""devil"" I mean ""Robot Devil."" And by ""metaphorically"" I mean ""get your coat."""
15069,"No, this isn't a religious visit. Fry just wants holophonor lessons."
15073,"Fry you smelly idiot, I think he's willing to make some kind of deal with the devil with you."
15077,Fry if you don't take this offer right now I will lose all respect for you and punch you.
15080,Wow.
15082,I got a hundred bucks on Rectal-Exambot!
15085,It's not ironic it's just coincidental. Now fork over those lady-fingers cookie!
15098,Where'd I go just now?
15123,True but at least I don't have the hiccups anymore. What up?
15125,"Forget it, you can't tempt me."
15127,"Hm. I forgot you could tempt me with things I want.  Well, I suppose I've always wondered what it would be like to be more annoying."
15129,Grabby and Squeezy? Never! I love these guys!
15131,"No, nothing ain't gonna happen."
15132,Yes! With this built-in stadium airhorn I can really annoy people. And all it cost me was my crotchplate.
15134,"Yeah, that'll teach the first person I see a lesson!"
15137,"Pretty annoying, huh Leela?"
15139,Oops. I'm so so sorry Leela. I just wanted to annoy you.
15142,"It's not ironic, it's just mean. Take this!"
15144,Oh yeah? Well bite my shiny metal - (shouting) Oh nooo!
15146,OK deafo.
15155,I don't recall ever fighting Godzilla but that is so what I would have done.
15193,"(singing) The use of words expressing something other than their literal intention,"
