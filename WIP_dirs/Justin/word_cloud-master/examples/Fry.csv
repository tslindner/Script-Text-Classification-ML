1,And that's how you play the game!
4,"Michelle, baby! Where you going?"
6,I hate my life I hate my life I hate my life.
8,"Hello? Pizza delivery for......Icy Wiener?! Aw, crud! I always thought at this point in my life I'd be the one making the crank calls!  Here's to another lousy millennium."
19,What the?
20,"My God! It's the future. My parents, my co-workers, my girlfriend. I'll never see any of them again. Yahoo!"
25,Cool! Just like in Star Trek!  Ow!
27,"Uh, Fry."
29,Can I ask you a question?
31,Uh...
33,Sort of.
35,What's with the eye?
37,"Cool, an alien! Has your race taken over the Earth?"
39,Wait a minute! Is that blimp accurate?
41,"My God, a million years!"
43,"Y'know, I guess it should be but actually I'm glad. I had nothing to live for in my old life. I was broke, I had a humiliating job and I was beginning to suspect my girlfriend might be cheating on me."
47,That's great! What's the little guy's name?
49,Eurgh!
50,"Y'know, I'm the luckiest guy in the whole future. I've been given a second chance and this time I'm not going to be a total loser.  What's that?"
52,Delivery boy? No! Not again! Please! Anything else!
54,What if I refuse?
56,Fine!
58,But I don't like being a delivery boy.
60,Keep that thing away from me!
62,See you in a thousand years!  You owe me one.
63,Whoa!
65,Cool!  Um. Cross Town Express?
67,"Hey! A phone booth! I can call my nephew. Wow, a real live robot! Or is that some kind of cheesy New Year's costume?"
69,It doesn't look so shiny to me.
73,"Yeah, I'd like to place a collect call."
77,Help! What's happening?
86,Why would a robot need to drink?
88,Really? What do you do Bender?
90,You any good at it?
92,What?
94,Wait! You're the only friend I have!
96,"Yeah, ever since I was six."
98,"Oh, no, it's the Cyclops!  Don't look! Don't look!"
104,Spock? Hey! Do the thing!
106,This is unbelievable! What do you heads do all day?
112,"Yeah, well, if you're sorry why are you doing it?"
116,Ow! Stoppit! Down boy! Bad president!
129,"Wait a second. You're a bender, right? We can get out of here if you just bend the bars."
131,Who cares what you're programmed for. If someone programmed you to jump off a bridge would you do it?
134,"C'mon, Bender! It's up to you to make your own decisions in life. That's what separates people and robots from animals...and animal robots."
136,"Come on, Bender! You can do it."
138,Yes!
140,I don't know how you did that.
144,Good Lord! What is this?
146,"Its my old neighbourhood. Man, this brings back a lot of memories."
148,This is where I brought my girlfriend on our very first date.
149,My God! She's gone. Everyone I ever knew or cared about is gone.
151,"Oh, can't you leave me alone? I'm miserable enough already."
153,"No, you don't. I've got no home, no family..."
155,...My whole world is gone. You can't possibly understand what it feels like to be so alone.
157,"Look, Leela, I don't understand this world but you obviously do, so I give up. If you really think I should be a delivery boy, I'll do it.  Your chip. What are you doing?"
159,Why?
161,What is the matter with you?
166,Correction. We're unemployed but we have a doddering old relative to mooch off of.
169,I'm your dear old Uncle Fry.
176,Whoa! A real live spaceship!
179,No!
184,I'll get us out of here.
198,Blast-off!
201,"So I guess without jobs, we'll be fugitives forever."
205,Yes! Yes! That's exactly the job I've always wanted!
208,This is awesome! Are we gonna fly through space fighting monsters and teaching alien women to lurve?
210,Cool! What's my job gonna be?
212,"So, I'm gonna be a delivery boy?"
214,Alright! I'm a delivery boy!
218,Wow!
226,Are there really giant birds like that?
228,I'm never going to get used to the 31st century.  Caffinated bacon? Baconated grapefruit? Admiral Crunch?
244,Hi -- eurgh!
249,I only have one.
251,"Uh, is there a human doctor around?"
259,"Well, the doctor says I'm as healthy as a crab. Can I go into space now?"
262,(chuffed) Last time I checked.
269,"Finally! Come on Bender, let's mosey!"
271,So where are we going anyway?
273,The moon? The moon moon? Wow! I'm gonna be a famous hero just like Neil Armstrong and those other brave guys no one ever heard of!
277,Can I do the countdown?
279,Ten......nine --
281,"Hurry up, I wanna see the moon!"
283,That's one small step for Fry --
285,"Wow!  Um, can I have cuts?"
287,You're not gonna believe this but they landed an amusement park on the moon!
289,"Lets go, already!"
291,Let's just dump it in the sewer and say we delivered it.
294,I had more but you go ahead.
296,But I've never been to the moon before.
300,Clear!
302,Ready!
304,My first space delivery.
305,"Uh, greetings, Moon Man, we come in peace. I am Fry from the planet Earth."
307,"But you are lazy, right?"
314,"Hey, I got you guys refrigerator magnets."
316,So you flip out and start acting like some crazy folk singer?
324,This is weak!
327,"I don't know. This place is great and all but its just so artificial. The gravity, the air, the gophers. You might as well stay on Earth.  That's what I came to see! I wanna go out there and jump around like an astronaut. Screw this phoney stuff!"
331,I don't care how educational it is. Let's do it!
333,Finally! Get ready for some serious moon action.
337,"That's not an astronaut, it's a TV comedian. And he was just using space travel as a metaphor for beating his wife."
345,I do.
350,That's not how it happened.
352,This is stupid. I'm taking this thing out to the real moon.
354,Not for long!
357,Agreed.  Yee-haw! Woo! Yeah! Crank up the radio!
359,Yee-haw!
361,No not yet. How 'bout we go look for the original moon landing site?
363,Well I'm feelin' lucky!  Uh... I'm ready to go back now.
364,"We're gonna die! It's every man for himself!  Help me, Leela!  You did it! We're safe!"
366,It's every man for himself.
373,"(gasping) I'm sorry, Leela, I can't go on any further. Just leave me to die in that barn over there."
376,"No, sir. We're amusement park patrons."
380,I guess we could do chores for a few hours.
383,Fahrenheit or Celsius?
385,Robot daughters?
392,Whoa!
394,"And it was great! We got to see craters and rocks and that one incredible rock that looked like a crater and, and these fellas."
396,I guess I can't.
400,"Oh, Bender. You didn't touch the Crushinator, did you?"
404,It's too low.
408,"Hey, cool! Dark side of the moon!"
413,Over there! Look! It's the moon landing site! We found it!
415,"It's that flag from MTV! And Neil Armstrong's footprint!  Hey! My foot's bigger! Leela, isn't this the greatest thing you've ever seen?"
419,"Look, Leela, I'm sorry. I never should have dragged you out here."
421,I never told anybody this but a thousand years ago I used to look up at the moon and dream about being an astronaut. I just didn't have the grades. Nor the physical endurance. Plus I threw up a lot and nobody liked spending a week with me.
423,"The moon was like this awesome, romantic, mysterious thing, hanging up there in the sky where you could never reach it, no matter how much you wanted to. But you're right. Once you're actually here it's just a big dull rock. I guess I just wanted you to see it through my eyes, the way I used to."
426,It's Amy! We're saved!
433,"Well, close enough!"
440,I'm sorry. I was up really late poking through people's desks.
444,And great lift!
446,"Hey, when you look this good, you don't have to know anything."
451,"Hey, Professor, great jerky!"
456,"Sheesh! 40,000 channels and only 150 have anything good on."
461,"Hmm, must be a friend of theirs."
466,I know but I forgive you.
468,Uh-huh.
470,Right.
472,Leela! We're trying to watch TV.
474,"So, who's that weird-looking guy?"
476,What's he do?
478,Boring!
481,"Hey, uh, why is the TV getting smaller?"
484,It looked good but I just don't feel like eating. You want it?
486,What are the cigars for?
488,I can't believe they threw me out like that. I must have been really acting like a jerk.
490,I don't know. Do refrigerators still come in cardboard boxes?
492,Really? That'd be great! You sure I won't be imposing?
495,"Cool! Y'know, I've never even seen a robot's apartment before."
498,It's kinda cramped in here. I don't even have room to hang my clothes.
500,"Wait, Bender. Bender?"
502,"Bender, wake up!"
504,"Uh, listen, Bender, uh, where's your bathroom?"
506,Bathroom.
508,Bathroom!
510,"Ah, never mind!"
515,"Oh, it's Bender's apartment. He put in carpeting yesterday so now my head hits the ceiling. Hey, do you realise you're standing at a weird angle?  Now you're OK."
517,(sexily) Is that an invitation?
519,"Yeah, but he might get kind of upset. I don't think I can do that to him."
521,"Well, I'm moving out!"
523,"I'm sorry, Bender, but there's just not enough room."
532,"Hmm, I'm not sure we want to pay for a dimension we're not going to use."
533,"Well, I give up. What's the catch?"
535,Not one place even remotely liveable.
542,"Well, this place has everything except the only thing I care about: A TV."
545,Ooh!
547,"Man, it's a total sty! For the first time in a thousand years, I feel like I'm home."
551,"Ooh!  Hey, Amy!"
555,"Hey, hang on, All My Circuits is about to start!"
557,Hey!
560,"Shh, the wedding's about to start!"
562,Is he objecting or backing up?
569,It just went out.
572,"(shouting) Come back, Bender, its working!"
574,It's out again.
576,It's back on!
598,"It's tempting, but, well, I am already kinda settled in here."
600,"Uh, listen, is there maybe some way we could do this with you going and me not going?"
602,"Well, you were gonna live in the closet anyway. Won't you be just as happy back in your old place?"
604,I'll come visit sometime. And you can visit me here.
606,"Anyway, I'm sure it'll work out. This way we'll both be happy."
617,"Hey, thanks for coming."
619,"Ah, come on. Bender loves mobs."
621,Don't girl me with that girl stuff. Bender and me are guys. Guys don't have feelings.
623,Same thing.
638,What up?
640,Silent? You've been meddling for two solid weeks.
642,Really? I didn't think he'd miss this apartment that much.
644,"Oh, man. I had no idea. If only I knew where he was I'd go talk to him."
645,"Oh, stupid TV!  Bender! You're blind stinking sober!"
647,Don't do it!
650,Cutting Leela's head off won't solve anything!
652,"Hey, yeah! That sounds good. Can I give you a hand?"
654,But it's a useless antenna. It's not like he's a ham radio or something.
656,"Hey, it works! The static's gone."
662,She's right.
664,"Apology accepted. After all, you're only human."
666,What's wrong?
668,"Aww, this isn't right. Listen, Bender, if we found your antenna could they still reattach it?"
673,It's good to be home.
675,"So that's where those skin flakes went. Hmm, do you think this fruit tree's going to get enough light?"
677,"This is huge! Bender, why don't I just live in here?"
684,What was wrong with your date last night?
687,"Yeah. If you rule out every guy with a lizard tongue or a low I.Q. or an explosive violent temper, of course you're gonna be lonely."
699,Why's everyone wearing those rings?
701,I think they look cool.
716,No way! We've got so much in common.
718,"Uh, yeah! That rings a bell."
728,"Psst, I need the apartment tonight. Go see a saucy puppet show."
734,A delivery?
750,I bet you Leela's holding out for a nice guy with one eye.
752,"Yeah, that'd be a timesaver."
764,Wow! The Zapp Brannigan?
766,Who's the Zapp Brannigan?
770,Wow!
773,(teasing) Leela's got a boyfriend!
787,I heard that one time you single-handedly defeated a horde of rampaging somethings in the something something system.
789,Wow! I never would have thought of that!
805,What just happened?
807,Dang! Can I get this wrapped up?
838,"We can definitely escape, Bender. All you have to do is bend the hatch off this steam pipe."
840,No good! It's full of steam!
857,You wanna try escaping again?
859,"Man, Leela's been gone a long time. I hope she's at least making progress with Zapp Brannigan."
878,Really? Why?
880,What does that mean?
887,"Yeah, a barbecue! I'll wear my hilarious apron."
897,Where'd they all go?
899,I can't believe we flew halfway across the galaxy and enjoyed a steam just to get lunch for that stupid animal!
902,The planet's kerploding!
905,"Man, lucky for us Zapp Brannigan's nearby."
907,What? What are you talking about?
910,"How could you, Leela? I thought you had some standards. I mean, jeez, he's a dumb, gross gorilla!"
912,No!
930,"Wow, way to tell that guy off. Now what's your secret escape plan?"
934,Pew!
940,We're heroes!
949,"It really puts things in perspective. I mean, from up here an entire world can seem utterly insignificant."
951,I don't get this. Is blernsball exactly the same as baseball?
954,"Boring? Baseball wasn't -- hmm, so they finally jazzed it up?"
955,Home run! Ha ha! Yay! Right?
957,What just happened? Why is the ball on that springy thing?
965,"Mmm, at least hotdogs haven't changed."
967,Me!
971,"Hey, I'm starting to get the hang of this game. The blerns are loaded, the count's three blerns and two anti-blerns and the infield blern rule is in effect, right?"
981,What are you talking about? There's all kinds of robots down there.
983,11?
986,What's wrong?
992,"Well, aren't they?"
995,Why is that great news?
1004,Really? Which one?
1007,"Man, that one was a blast!"
1012,So let me get this straight: This planet is completely uninhabited?
1014,Oh. Kinda like how a warehouse is inhabited by boxes.
1020,"Yeah, but I guess I'd be kinda angry too if I had to go to some uninhabited planet."
1023,"Ah, Bender must be done with the delivery."
1025,"Oh, my God! We have to go down and rescue him."
1027,W-what are we gonna do?
1030,"(mechanical voice) I am fully operational, captain."
1032,I can sorta dance like a robot. Will that help?
1034,"Man, we look stupid. We should've gotten store-bought costumes."
1039,"Uh, yup! Just two robots out roboting it up!  Eh?"
1043,(whispering) C!  (talking) Is the puppy mechanical in any way?
1054,I can't. I have to go to the bathroom.
1056,"Oh, right. I wonder where they smoke in high school."
1060,Uh...
1062,"I think the leak's stopping itself. Wait. Wait. Yeah, there we go. Wait. Yeah!"
1075,"Wow, the 3-D's great!"
1080,God help us!
1083,"Umm, too much romance, not enough human killing."
1089,I'm over here.
1093,It's him! He's OK!
1095,Ahh! It's good to hear his voice!
1097,My God! He's become evil.  I mean eviler!
1112,Psst! Bender!
1114,We've been looking for you. Last we heard you were under arrest as a human sympathiser.
1118,We're rescuing you.
1120,Say what?
1122,"But, Bender, we're your friends."
1124,That's not true.
1126,"Bye, Bender. I'll miss you."
1134,"Hey, wait a minute! Isn't anyone going to defend us?"
1142,Call technical support.
1145,No!
1150,"Oh, yeah."
1153,You don't look very old.
1159,But the judge already sentenced us at the trial!
1169,Damn right!
1181,Stop! Take one more step and I'll breathe fire on you!
1187,"So long, suckers!  Uh, hello, suckers!"
1192,We wanted to show you that we really do respect your robot heritage.
1195,But that doesn't make it any less meaningful.
1199,"I can't take it anymore! They've been at it for hours!  (shouting) Give it a rest, you two!"
1202,"Uh, excuse me? I missed a few lectures. Uh, what subject is this?"
1204,What a nightmare!
1207,What a weird dream! I'll never get back to sleep.
1208,So you're telling me they broadcast commercials into people's dreams?
1210,"But, how is that possible?"
1212,That's awful. It's like brainwashing.
1214,"Well, sure, but not in our dreams. Only on TV and radio. And in magazines and movies and at ball games and on buses and milk cartons and t-shirts and written in the sky. But not in dreams. No siree!"
1222,Cool.  Can I try these on before I buy them?
1224,: Ooh! Ho ho ho!
1228,$30? I can't afford that. Unless... Do you take Visa?
1230,American Express?
1232,Discover card?
1235,"No, I can't afford them. Being poor sucks. What kind of world is this where they advertise things not everybody can afford?"
1238,Hey who's the rocker jockey?
1244,"Hey, Bender. Sounds like you could use a little of that oil."
1249,"78, 79. 79.50. Crud! We're 50 cents short."
1251,"Hey, that's my old bank. Maybe my account's still open."
1253,"Yeah, well, I did open the account over a thousand years ago. What about my ATM card?"
1255,"Sure! It's the price of a cheese pizza and a large soda back where I used to work, Panucci's Pizza."
1257,Alright!
1263,Pizza dinner on me!  Just keep the tab under $50 million.
1265,"Uh, yeah. We'll have one with everything but anchovies and one with my all time favourite topping, anchovies!"
1267,Anchovies? You know? Those little headless fish?
1270,What?!
1273,"So none of you has ever had anchovies? Oh, man! You don't know what you're missing. They were all salty and oily and they melted in your mouth and --"
1275,I just wished I could've showed you guys how great they were. I may be rich but I still can't buy back all the things I miss from the 20th century.
1277,So? What do you think?
1280,What's wrong with it?
1285,Yes!
1287,I have an idea for a sitcom.
1292,Anchovies?!
1294,"15,000!"
1297,"50,000!"
1299,Don't tell me how to spend my money.
1303,"100,000."
1306,500!
1308,Two.
1310,14!
1312,One jillion dollars.
1314,"Oh. In that case, 50 million."
1319,Now for some good old 20th century TV.
1321,"Ah, those were the days."
1324,Eh?
1326,I've been sitting right here. I picked up my life exactly where I left off a thousand years ago. Now if you'll excuse me it's 8 o'clock. Time to get biz-ay!
1328,I could if you hadn't turned on the lights and shut off the stereo.
1330,I'm rich! I can live whenever I want.
1333,"Junk? Maybe you can't understand this but I've finally found what I need to be happy, and it's not friends: It's things."
1335,Just leave me alone.
1337,"I don't need them. Not when I have my antique videos, my bucket of fossilised KFC and 50 million dollars worth of anchovies."
1368,I didn't order any --
1372,Where am I?
1374,"That sounds like me but, I thought I got frozen. Wasn't I in the future?"
1376,"So I'm really back? That's exactly what I wanted, I guess. Who are you?"
1378,You are? Did you grow a moustache since last night?
1383,"Hey, look! Anchovies!"
1385,Ooh!
1387,Uh...
1392,Wait. You're Pamela Anderson! Cool! What can I get you?
1396,"Uh, cheese and a --  That was quick!"
1398,10.77. Same as my PIN number.
1404,"Oh, I had a nightmare I was in the year 2000 and you guys never existed. I'm so glad I'm awake now and you're really here."
1407,"No, that's not true!"
1411,"Bender! Leela! Don't leave me. Wait a minute! Hey, buddy what year is this?"
1413,3000? Yes! I'm still in the future! Life is wonderful!  Wait! What are you doing with my stuff?
1415,"Oh, no, my ATM card! My secret PIN number! 1077. I've got nothing left. Except..."
1418,Leela! Bender! I missed you so much!
1420,I was robbed. They got everything except these.
1425,Sorry. But the anchovies aren't for sale.
1427,"You might as well put that chequebook away, because I've discovered something even more important. My friends. And they aren't worth even a penny to me. That's why these anchovies are going on a pizza, so I can share the food I love with the people I like."
1429,What a nice lady!
1430,"OK, my friends. Get ready for the most delicious extinct animal you've ever tasted."
1432,"Ah, no one likes them at first but they'll grow on you."
1434,There aren't any more. And there never will be.
1442,"Hey, what you watching?"
1448,"Its OK, Bender, I like cooking too."
1455,You're gonna be the ship's cook?
1459,Bam!
1460,So this is Little Neptune?
1465,Ooh! What's this?
1467,Wait a minute! This says Z-Ray.
1469,"Hmm, I can see where that would be an advantage. Do you take cash?"
1471,"I'm not a little kid, Leela. I grew up in this city. These are my people. What up?"
1473,See?
1474,Wow! You guys sell every kind of meat here except human!
1481,"Now that you mention it, I do have trouble breathing underwater sometimes. I'll take the gills."
1483,Can't imagine why I would.
1489,"I'm capable of making my own decisions, Leela. Did you ever stop to think I might be happier with gills?"
1500,(shouting) Hey Bender how's dinner coming?
1504,"Yeah, OK."
1507,That's the saltiest thing I've ever tasted. And I once a big heaping bowl of salt!
1510,My vision's fading. I think I'm gonna die.
1514,Ow!
1516,"Jeez, will you lay off! I was delivering things before you were born! I think I know what I'm doing."
1517,"Stupid slug. I've never been so thirsty. Oh, come on! Go down already!  Ah!"
1518,Hello? Anybody home?
1521,No! It wasn't me!
1523,I didn't mean to. He just looked so cool and refreshing.
1528,It could have been. But chances were equally good it was an Emperor.
1530,You might.
1534,I gotta go with Bender.
1537,"Gee, you think so, Captain? I'd better check with my Prime Minister."
1540,"Hey, thanks!  Wow! This got here just in time."
1542,"Umm, how about that one?"
1544,"On second thought, I'll take that one."
1547,"You don't have to beat around the bush, Leela, we all know who you're talking about...uh, me, right?"
1554,"There won't be a lot of long-winded speeches, will there?"
1556,Will there be cake?
1559,There you go.
1562,"Oh, yeah! Yeah, he's right!"
1565,So?
1567,"80,000 years?"
1569,Damn! I knew you wouldn't have asked unless it was really high or really low.
1571,Well at least my assassin will get what's coming to him.
1573,"Hey, I plan on having a few brewskis myself."
1575,"Yeah, I was going to thumb through that later."
1577,"Hell, no. If I stopped to think ahead, I wouldn't be Emperor. And I wouldn't even be here in the year 3000. It's just like the story of the grasshopper and the octopus. All year long the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter while the octopus mooched off his girlfriend and watched TV. But then the winter came and the grasshopper died and the octopus ate all his acorns and also he got a racecar. Is any of this getting through to you?"
1579,Who asked you to? I told you a hundred times to stop treating me like a baby. Now go. Go gather your nuts you nagging grasshopper.
1581,I'll be fine. It's not like anyone's gonna drink me.  Quit it!
1583,What up?
1585,"Right! I, Fry, who drank Bont the Viscous, who drank Ungo the Moist, who guzzled Zorn the Stagnant..."
1586,"...who slurped Hudge the Dewy, who enjoyed a soup composed principally of Throm the Chunky, do solemnly swear to rule with honour and insanity - uh, integrity!"
1592,My tummy hurts!
1595,Ow!
1598,What am I gonna do?
1601,But won't that crush my bones?
1605,I could vomit or urinate. Would you feel better about that?
1608,That's a great idea! Crying.
1612,It's no use. I wanna cry but I'm just too macho.
1614,What do you mean? I was Emperor of a whole planet.
1616,These things happen.
1618,Phew! That's a load off my mind.
1624,She'll never help me. She's still mad that I told her never to help me.
1637,What the hell is that?
1640,This is the saddest day of my life. And I still can't cry.
1643,I can't believe it. She's risking her life for me after the way I treated her. I don't deserve this. I feel terrible.
1645,Is she alright?
1647,No. No!
1650,This can't be happening.
1652,"All Leela ever wanted to do was help me. But I was to proud, too stupid to accept it.  I wish I had died instead of her."
1654,Leela! You're alive!
1661,"Thanks, Leela. From now on, I'll take all the help you're willing to give. I know you just want what's best for me.  Ow! What was that for?  Hey, come on!  That hurt!"
1663,"(crying) Oh, now I understand."
1665,"(crying) Thanks, everybody. I love you all. You guys are true -- ow! Cut it out, Bender! That's a tender area!"
1669,"Hey, wait a minute! Who are you?"
1671,"Oh, you're welcome."
1678,Wow! I love symposia.
1684,Sounds like fun. How long do I have left to live?
1687,Who's the gross nerd?
1694,Who's that jerk?
1706,"Don't worry, Professor, it's no competition for your death clock."
1726,"No, Professor, don't give up. There were plenty of times in my century when I was gonna give up but I never did. Never! Hey, are you even listening to me? Oh, I give up!"
1729,Did you build the Smellescope?
1731,Smells like strawberries.
1733,"Pine needles. Oh, man, this is great! Hey, as long as you don't make me smell Uranus."
1736,Oh. What's it called now?
1738,"No, no, I think I'll just smell around a bit over here!  Hmm.  Hmm."
1744,So this thing's gonna destroy the whole city?  What the heck is it?
1747,Wow! You got that off the Internet? In my day the Internet was only used to download pornography.
1753,"Hey, hey, gimmie a break! What do you do with it?"
1757,The future is disgusting.
1759,"Hey! You have no right to criticise the 20th century. We gave the world the lightbulb, the steamboat and the cotton gin."
1761,"Yeah, well, they probably just copied us."
1794,"Hmm, sporty!"
1795,Wow!
1797,It's not filth. It's a glorious monument to the achievements of the 20th century. Look! A real Beanie Baby.  Oh! A Mr. Spock collector's plate!  Some Bart Simpson dolls!
1801,This junk isn't garbage! I can dig in any random pile and find something great.
1802,"(gasping) Alright, let's get to work."
1806,We're gonna die! (calmly) Right?
1811,We're saved!
1816,"No, it's my fault too. I'm sure I threw out more than my share of that trash up there. Also, one month my toilet broke and it just went straight in the garbage can.  Leela was right. The people of the 20th century were idiotic slobs. Especially me."
1834,"Uh, what about garbage?"
1837,Then it's time to make some more.
1839,Stand back and watch the master! This Slurm can.  Now it's garbage. These papers.  Garbage. This picture of your wife.  Pure garbage. Now you try it.
1841,"Good!  Don't finish that cruller, throw it away  Bender. Drink that beer and drop the bottle on the ground.  Very nice."
1843,People of New New York. Take a lesson from the 20th century. Stop all this pain-in-the-ass recycling and throw your garbage on the floor.
1844,Go ahead. Just chuck it any old place like I used to. Your city is counting on you.
1850,Oops!
1852,It worked!
1858,Who cares? That won't be for hundreds of years.
1860,That's the 20th century spirit!
1863,This is awesome! I've been waiting a thousand years to see a Beastie Boys show.
1865,Sure!
1870,Will you guys shut up! I'm trying to look cool.
1873,Wow! An old-fashioned mosh pit! Come on guys. Tonight we're gonna party like its 1999...again.
1875,"Man, these guys rock harder than ever!"
1887,"Wow! I love you guys! Back in the 20th century, I had all five of your albums."
1889,Cool! Can I borrow the new ones? And a couple of blank tapes?
1900,Hey uh Bender. What are we doing in this bad neighbourhood?
1904,Who was that guy?
1912,Bender? No way!  I definitely would've noticed something.
1917,I know Big Vinnie said he was giving me the kiss of death but I still think he was gay.
1919,"A little.  You OK, Bender?"
1925,What's happening? I-I feel weird!
1931,And you made me feel like a jerk for trusting you. Just like when my friend Richie swore he wasn't taking drugs and then he sold me my mom's VCR and then later I found out he was taking drugs. You make me ashamed to be your friend.
1944,Great he's whacked out on electricity again.
1946,Religon? Is this another scam to get free yarmulkes?
1967,Does that mean we can eat now?
1969,"Oh, uh, but I don't want to."
1973,Bender's stupid religion is driving me nuts.
1976,We've got to get the old Bender back.
1979,"Uh, this."
1983,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, Bender. So long as we're here why don't we take in some, exotic dancing!"
1986,"Come on, it'll be fun! Maybe we could even drink a little fortified wine."
1990,And there's Hookerbot 5000. She's got a heart of solid gold!
1993,"Pfft, that's for losers. C'mon, sin your heart out."
1997,"Go for it, Bender. You know you wanna!"
2000,Look's like we got the old Bender back!
2005,"Well he didn't check out. The ashtray's still here.  Look, Nibbler's caught the scent of vodka and motor oil! Go, boy. Follow that stench."
2012,Wait! I remember this place. They shut it down after all those people caught salmonella from the flume ride.
2014,"Unbelievable. It's an actual, factual Robot Hell."
2016,Actually --
2031,(singing) I don't feel well.
2033,(singing) Maybe he likes it here in hell.
2035,(singing) Maybe he's back at the motel.
2037,(singing) My ass has blisters from the slide.
2039,"Bender, are you alright?"
2045,Wouldn't a solid gold fiddle weigh hundreds of pounds and sound crummy?
2048,"(whispering) No, do you?"
2056,Run!
2064,Good old Bender!
2070,Yeah. I'm never going to another planet called Cannibalon!
2077,This is great! I haven't had time off since I was 21 through 24.
2082,"Hey, uh, where's my suitcase?  Ow!"
2091,Huh?  Ooh! How do you do?
2095,"Man, first class seems nice!"
2099,Well at least we get a window!
2102,I guess that just leaves you and your fake fiancé ... all alone ... on a romatic cruise.
2104,
2138,"Yeah, it's pretty romantic-- Uh, I mean platonic. Th-That sure is one platonic view!"
2140,Hmm? Mmmm!
2143,"Well, you got anything else for him?"
2146,Hmm? Mmmm!
2147,"See you later, wuvvums!"
2149,"I'm not going out with Amy. It's just to fool her parents. Hey, you're not jealous, are you?"
2151,"Good, 'cause I consider my fake relationship with you a lot more meaningful."
2170,"Go, Professor!"
2192,"Thank you, sir."
2194,"Well, rest assured, Leela's the only girl for me."
2200,(whispering) Sure I can. I learned how to handle delicate social situations from a little show called Three's Company.
2204,"Um, let me think. Come and knock on our door, nuh nuh nuh nuh nuh nuh. Uh, Mr Roper--"
2207,Uh ...
2213,"Ah, now there's something we can all enjoy."
2218,"Hey, Leela, why'd you run off from dinner?"
2220,"Oh, look, I'm not actually interested in her if that's what's bothering you."
2222,"I know, we seem like a perfect match, but I just don't feel that way about her."
2224,Yeah.
2226,And me.
2228,Talk about a mood killer!
2236,"You're going back or the Countess, aren't you?"
2238,"I'll tell them you went out prying the wedding ring off his cold, dead finger."
2250,Then we're dead meat. No one could squeeze under there!
2273,Look! It's our nebula. Whenever I see it I'll think back to that moment when we almost--  Never mind!
2276,"Goodbye, Bender."
2280,Look!
2289,"Don't cry, Bender. Nobody really knows what happens in a black hole. It's possible she's still alive in another dimension somewhere. Right, Professor?"
2296,Who's it going to?
2302,Is it dangerous?
2304,Very impressive. Back in the 20th century we had no idea there was a university on Mars.
2307,Does that mean it's safe to breathe the air?
2313,What was your minor?
2331,"I tell you, being here really takes me back to my college days."
2334,Good old Coney Island College! Go Whitefish!
2336,"Oh, yeah?  Read it and weep. I'm a certified college dropout."
2339,"What?! That's not fair. I deserve the same respect any other college dropout gets. By God, I'm gonna enroll here at Mars University and drop out all over again!"
2341,"Aww, thanks for believing in me."
2343,"Oh, I don't know.  Hey, Professor, what are you teaching this semester?"
2345,Mathematics of wanton burrito meals. I'll be there!
2347,See you in class!
2357,"Hey, pretty nice for a single. Two desks, two chairs, a couple of beds.  A woodpecker."
2359,"Oh, right, cool. (shouting) C'mon in, roomie!  (talking) What the--?"
2361,My roommate's a monkey?
2364,You know each other?
2368,Is he genetically engineered?
2371,"I understood the word ""hat""!"
2373,You want a banana?
2375,I don't like you.
2376,This is gonna be a cakewalk!
2380,Swish!
2382,"I'm from the 20th century. Go ahead, ask me anything."
2384,Ooh ... I know this ... whatyya call it? Lite Brite!
2402,"So, Chrissy, we seem to be hitting it off. If you're not doing anything later might I escort you to a kegger?"
2407,"Sorry, I overslept."
2409,It's that obnoxious monkey. He kept me up all night with his constant thinking. Just thinking and thinking. He's trying to make me look like an idiot.
2411,I hate that rodent!
2413,That'll show him.
2421,Now these monkeys I like!  What's that? You wanna come out?
2426,"Hey, uh, Guenter? Why don't you get up on the chandelier with your parents and I'll take a picture?"
2431,You mean peer pressure?
2432,Look out! He's got a gun!
2436,"Hey, hey, cheer up. Not everyone turns out like their parents. I mean, look at me. My folks were honest hardworking people."
2441,"Look, Guenter, if you're so miserable here, maybe you should just go back to the jungle."
2445,"Thanks, Professor!"
2447,(screaming) Ow!
2453,I guess he realised I was right when I told him to go back to the jungle.
2455,"Hey, don't blame me. You tried to force Guenter to be a human but he's an animal. He belongs in the wild. Or in the circus on one of those tiny tricycles. Now that's entertainment."
2468,"Wow"" The jungles on Mars look just like the jungles on Earth."
2474,There's our man!
2477,"No, the banana, the banana!"
2479,"Banana, banana, banana!"
2487,No.
2494,'Preciate it Guenter!
2498,Guenter! You're alive!
2508,"Pizza delivery! Wow, so this is a real TV station, huh?"
2510,What are you showing right now?
2512,"Ah, I dunno. That's a chick show. I prefer programmes of the genre ""world's blankiest blank""."
2514,I'm in!
2520,Pfft! Like anyone on Earth cares.
2526,"Ow! Hey, quit it, Hermes. It's Labor Day."
2528,That's the one.
2533,"(unenthusiastic) Eh, I think I'll just stay here."
2535,But this is HDTV. It's got better resolution than the real world!
2537,Not covered!
2540,"Wait, Mount Rushmore and the Leaning Tower of Pisa? I didn't know they were both in New York!"
2548,"Ah, just like my dad used to make ... until McDonald's fired him."
2557,"It's OK, Leela, go ahead. I got a lot of work to do."
2559,50 bucks?! Not even if she was my girlfriend. You take her.
2564,Voila. The greatest sandcastle ever built. This is the kind of castle King Arthur would have lived in -- If he were a fiddler crab.
2566,"Ooh, yeah. Anyone have a camera?"
2571,(screaming) Nooo!
2573,"We're all gonna die, aren't we?"
2586,A what?
2598,You mean while I'm sleeping in it?
2601,W-Wouldn't it make more sense to send the robots in first a--
2606,"I'm gonna be a science-fiction hero, just like Uhura, or Captain Janeway, or Xena!"
2608,"Sure, I just like TV better."
2611,"Alright, scumwads. This one's for Bender's cocktail!"
2636,Miniskirts? That sounds familiar.
2640,"Wait, I know her."
2642,"That's where I know her from. She's Jenny McNeal. She was a character on a TV show back in the 20th century, Single Female Lawyer."
2647,It's crazy! How could they even know about a show from a thousand years ago?
2649,Magic. Got it.
2651,Beer -- I would think.
2655,"Y'know, I saw the first 30 seconds of that episode. If I could make up an ending, maybe we could act it out ourselves."
2659,Let's put on a show.
2660,"OK, Leela, you'll be starring as Jenny--"
2664,"Places, everyone."
2666,Lights!  Camera one!  Camera two!  Camera three!
2679,"Well, it took an hour to write. I thought it would take an hour to read."
2681,"I don't know, I don't know. Just say anything. As long as it's compelling, mesmerising, a tour de force."
2685,"No, no! Go to commercial!"
2687,Married? Jenny can't get married.
2689,"But that's not why people watch TV. Clever things make people feel stupid, and unexpected things make them feel scared."
2691,You see? TV audiences don't want anything original. They wanna see the same thing they've seen a thousand times before.
2693,"Trust me on this. While other people were out living their lives, I wasted mine watching TV, because deep down I knew it might one day help me save the world. Plus, I would have lost my Workman's Comp if I hadd gone outside. Now just read these cue cards."
2694,And action!
2701,And ... cut!
2704,"Way to overact ,Zoidberg!"
2707,"Yep.  It was just a matter of knowing the secret of all TV shows; At the end of the episode, everything's always right back to normal."
2723,I like those odds.  Rats. Just another tooth.  Aah!
2724,I gotta find that golden bottle-cap.
2726,This is nothing. Back in high school I used to drink a hundred cans of cola a week. Right up until my third heart attack.
2733,"I'm not Bender, I'm Fry."
2735,Nope. Human.
2750,I 'unno. Try it on me.  Ow! My sperm!
2752,"Huh, didn't hurt that time."
2754,What's wrong?
2759,"All this prolonged exposure to radiation is making me thirsty.  Ah, if only there was some way of knowing which can had the winning bottle-cap inside."
2761,"Wait a second. I'm getting an idea. N-No, false alarm. No. Yeah. No. Yeah. No. Wait. No. Yeah. Yeah. No ... no. Yes!"
2763,"We checked 90,000 cans of Slurm and all we won was this junk.  I never wanna see another can of Slurm again. Man, am I thirsty."
2766,(wheezy) Hooray!
2770,Uh-huh. Can we have our free Slurm now?
2787,"So, what's the secret ingredient?"
2789,Oh. But what is it really?
2797,Why?
2809,So thirsty.
2811,"Uh, could I have some Slurm, please?"
2813,When will that be?
2815,That's not soon enough.
2827,I'm dying of thirst. Grab my feet and dunk my head in so I can drink.
2829,Fine. I'll let go and swim around in the Slurm and drink as much as I want. Help! I can't swim!
2835,This isn't Slurm at all!
2838,My God. What if the secret ingredient ... is people?
2840,Oh. How is it?
2848,"Look! Slurm! Finally!  Oh, yeah! I'm never going 12 minutes without a Slurm again."
2850,"Well, whatever it is, it's even better fresh.  Mmm, still warm."
2851,Ew!
2855,That's the secret ingredient of Slurm?
2857,Ew!
2859,"Thanks, Bender!"
2869,Who's behind does that come from?
2878,What about me?
2880,Yes!
2882,Mmm!
2885,Here I come.  Let me just-- One more taste.
2889,I can't stop eating this delicious ooze. But I'm not gonna let you die.
2892,(screaming) Nooo!  (talking) I could fit if I didn't have these damn arms!
2897,Say what?
2905,But she'll crush you like a worm ... crushing a smaller worm.
2916,"Outlaw Slurm?  Uh, don't pay any attention to him sir ..."
2917,... Grandpa's making up crazy stories again.
2920,"Ah, I just wish Slurms MacKenzie were here to enjoy this with me."
2926,(simultaneously) For Slurms!
2929,Mmm!
2934,Is it me?
2936,"You alright, Bender?"
2956,"Hey, what are these rings in Nibbler's fang?"
2958,"Yeah, well, good luck. It'd take some kind of genius to count all those rings."
2963,Who's playing pin the tail on the moon maggot?
2972,(singing) ... and you smell like one too!
2999,Uh-oh. Is this gonna be another crazy experiment that crosses a line Man was not meant to cross?
3005,And that'll allow Bender to feel other people's emotions?
3018,(whispering) Thanks for covering.
3029,What's your problem?
3031,You do?
3034,What?
3036,(crying) They're just responding to my personality.
3040,(shouting) The spoon's in the foot powder.
3042,"Too bad he wasn't an alligator. Y'know, when you flush those things they stay alive in the sewers."
3044,Yep. My friend's cousin's caseworker saw one once. It's a widely-believed fact.
3047,Bender? Bender?!
3048,Have you seen my sombrero?
3050,"Hey, it's your fault. He only flushed himself because your emotions made him feel bad."
3052,"Oh, great, now you're making him feel worse!"
3058,God bless America.
3059,"Phew! Uh, ladies first."
3060,"Oh, and the aftertaste!"
3062,I burned my finger.
3064,"Looks like we're under Park Avenue. Ooh, ritzy! Just think: All this was probably once a charity luncheon for the Met."
3071,Eck! This emotional display is making me nauseous.  Or maybe it's whatever that is.
3075,"Hmm. According to this map, the only way out is through ... that pipe.  Don't worry. It gets wider after about a mile."
3078,"OK, OK, nevermind. I'll just ask those people for directions."
3081,I'll take care of this!  Back! Back!
3087,"Hey, aren't you supposed to be eating our brains? You're mutants."
3094,Daylight and everything.
3101,Wow. You guys worship an unexploded nuclear bomb?
3105,"So, is it true that alligators flushed down the toilet survive down here?"
3135,I'll take care of this.
3138,"Leela, your scaredness is being transmitted straight to Bender. If you care about Nibbler, stop caring about him!"
3140,Even me?
3142,Damn.
3150,Bender's gonna be killed!
3152,(cheering) Yeah!
3161,Looks like Bender learned an important lesson about respecting other people's feelings afterall.
3168,Hmm. Horsey to pointy guy six.  Check.
3170,(hoarse) Good move.
3173,Sorry.
3176,DOOP? What's that?
3178,Uh...
3180,(getting it) Oh!
3186,"Wow! There's a million aliens. I've never seen anything so mind blowing. Ooh, a reception table with muffins!"
3188,"So, what's it like on planet Amazonia?"
3190,That's so interesting. Maybe we could get to know each other over a coffee.
3249,"Hey, Bender?"
3252,"You don't have to get so mad, Leela."
3271,She's really strict.
3274,"No, she just makes us do work and stuff."
3286,"Hey, no prob', this lead apron'll protect me."
3289,Yeah!
3296,"Alright, don't get your panties in a knot. We'll just use the back-up dolly."
3302,I agree.
3306,"Ah, some good old high-gravity rain. That'll cool us off."
3308,"Yeah. If she had let us use the back-up dolly, we could have broken it, given up and gone home by now."
3310,"Ah, Leela's not that bad. I just wish she didn't make us work so much."
3313,Underpants?
3315,This is a mutiny.
3317,All hail the new captain.
3321,We don't have a brig.
3326,You were mean and you yelled and you made us do all that work.
3328,"Yeah, well, you shouldn't have been such a mean captain then."
3334,Ten hundred percent!
3343,"Ooh, burn!"
3346,"This is awesome! We're gonna be like pow-pow-pow, and they're gonna be like ...  ... and then we'll have pancakes to celebrate and I'll be like..."
3354,"Good, good, then what?"
3356,Wait a second. Is this plan gonna kill us?
3358,"Leela, we want you to be captain again."
3360,We want Leela to be captain again.
3366,Absolutely.
3371,And warm.
3376,It's too low.
3379,And no one will have to punish anyone for the mutiny.
3389,"Leela, I just want you to know that even though you're mean, you're the best captain ever."
3392,Please?
3396,"Aw, man."
3407,What do we care? We live in the United States.
3409,Wow! I have been gone a long time.
3412,These are the candidates? They sound like clones.  Wait a minute. They are clones!
3416,"If I were registered to vote, I send these clowns a message by staying home on election day and dressing up like a clown."
3418,Nope. Not vaccinated either! Besides. It's not like one vote ever made a difference.
3424,"Professor, when did you become so obsessed with voting?"
3427,The less fortunate get all the breaks!
3431,"What party do you belong to, Bender?"
3433,'Cause you're a robot?
3436,"OK, but what are the Brain Slugs who control you gonna do for the working man?"
3438,"(sarcastic) Sure, you say that now!"
3449,Now here's a party I can get excited about. Sign me up!
3451,"(downbeat) OK then, screw it."
3453,(excited) Alright!
3455,That was pretty cool. I think I'm actually starting to get interested in politics.
3466,Too bad you can't spend it.
3468,No.
3475,"Yeah, you look different. Did you get a haircut?"
3478,"This is crazy, Bender. How are you gonna live without a body?"
3480,"Well, at least now you can pay off your loan shark."
3489,"Hey, Bender, can I take a ride in your car?"
3491,Hey! You look me in the shins and say that.
3495,I recognise you. Didn't you used to have a body of some sort?
3497,"Well, you're looking great."
3499,Couldn't hurt.
3503,"(to Clinton) Hey, I remember you. I was gonna vote for you one time. But voting isn't cool so I stayed home alone and got trashed on Listerine."
3519,"I hear that. I spent most of my teen years loving my body. Course, it was tough love but -- ooh!"
3526,"Bender, what is it?"
3528,"It was just a dream, Bender. There's no such thing as two."
3532,"Hey, my clothes are worth 50 bucks!"
3537,"Ah, I can't stand to see a robot cry. Let's watch TV!"
3546,"Yeah, and that electric guitar."
3567,"Please, Mr. Nixon. We're appealing to your sense of decency."
3571,"No way! I'm not letting my best friend get recycled. Not for five cents, not for five hundred cents! Leela, I've got a plan!"
3573,(whispering) Why would Nixon stay at the Watergate?
3575,"Keep going, we're right behind you."
3584,Ooh!  Uh-oh!
3592,"Well, he lost my vote."
3600,"Hey, I've got one last thought."
3607,What?
3609,Why would robots vote for Nixon now that he's just a head in a jar?
3614,Well it's not my fault either 'cause I forgot to vote.
3634,This snow is beautiful. I'm glad global warming never happened.
3636,Hi!
3641,Look out! We're heading straight for those trees!
3644,Cool. Hey what do you do if you want the trees up?
3646,(hoarse) Trees down!
3654,"Yup, I remember. They came in last at the Olympics then retired to promote alcoholic beverages."
3656,"Oh, what the hell!  Ow!"
3662,"Yeah, it really puts you in the Christmas spirit."
3664,Christmas. You know? X-M-A-S.
3666,"Xmas, huh?  Y'know this'll be my first Xmas away from home."
3668,Yeah! An old-fashioned Xmas tree!
3669,Hey! These aren't Xmas trees!
3671,"They're supposed to be some kinda, you know, pine tree."
3673,This isn't the way Christmas is supposed to be.
3675,Everything's changed.
3679,(nostalgic) Every Christmas my mom would get a fresh goose for goose burgers and my dad would whip up his special eggnog out of bourbon and ice cubes. This dumb holiday just makes me think of all the things I left behind. Let's just stop talking about Xmas.
3685,"What's the point of Xmas when everyone you know died a thousand years ago? I'm the lonliest person on Earth.  Hey, Leela, how 'bout a little sympathy here, huh?  Yoiks! What was that about?"
3688,My God! Poor Leela.
3690,I feel like a rat. Here I am whining like a pig while all along Leela was lonely as a frog. I could kick myself.
3692,Ow! Thanks.
3704,Whose blood?
3706,I've got to do something to show Leela how sorry I am.
3708,"So it's left, left, right-- Wait! I have a better idea! I'll go out and get her the perfect Xmas present. Something so great she'll never want to be unhappy again."
3710,We'll see. I like to haggle.
3712,Say what?
3714,I know about Santa Claus.
3716,Wow! 2801! Anyway...
3722,There's this girl who I really like but she thinks I'm a jerk. Can you help me?
3724,"No, I need to get her a gift. And I need it before sundown."
3726,That's funny!
3733,You're the last store open. I need something for my friend Leela.  Just give me your best animal.
3735,That's a stupid animal. You're stupid! I said I want the best one. Now which costs more? The parrot or the Stink Lizard?
3737,"That's a hell of a good parrot. Although, I could get 500 lizards for the same price. Girls like swarms of lizards, right?"
3739,"Alright, I'll take the 500 lizards. No, wait, yes. No. Yes. Yes. Yes! The parrot!"
3740,"Well, I spent every penny I had but I bet Leela's gonna love you.  Hey, you're quite the talker, aren't you? Shut the hell up!  Ow!  Stupid bird! I know where you live."
3749,"Alright, bird, you thought you could beat me in a game of wits. But you just met your equal."
3750,Aha! Cornered!
3752,"Leela! Oh, my God! You saved my life. I am gonna get you so many lizards."
3754,"I just wanted to do something to make you happy. I mean, I miss my family but you never even had a family."
3756,"Merry Xmas, Leela."
3758,"Oh, boy! It's Santa!"
3760,Well check it twice!
3764,No! I swear!
3771,Please let us live! We'll put out milk and cookies for you!
3774,"I never thought it would end this way: Gunned down by Santa Claus. Honestly, I didn't see it coming!"
3776,"Goodbye, Leela.  Hey, look: We're under the mistletoe."
3778,"Uh, you're present may need some assembly."
3785,(shouting) Help!
3796,(shouting; from outside) Help!
3811,(shouting) He's gonna blow.
3815,"Uh, Bender? Where did you get that bird?"
3819,"Look, the food isn't what's important."
3821,"The important thing is we're all together for Xmas. And even though I'm surrounded by robots and monsters and old people, I've never felt more at home."
3836,Mmm. Mmm! Now this is what I call a thousand years of progress: A Bavarian creamdog that's also self-microwaving!
3839,Sack?
3847,Co-ed steam rooms! I love the future!
3849,"Ah, futuristic!"
3854,"Hey, Leela, look who's the super-stud!"
3857,"Hey, Dr. Zoidberg, what's that jazz on your head?"
3866,Maybe he has a parasite.
3873,"(simultaneously) No, Amy!"
3880,Eck!
3884,"Oh, baby, I'm there!"
3886,"Nope, but that's not the word I'm interested in. (shouting) Uh, no need to pack pants, people. Let's roll!"
3892,"Is that how you say ""Zoidberg""?"
3896,Who's the lucky lobsterina?
3900,"You and me both, brother!"
3905,I didn't come here to see any activity involving two guys. Where do you people do your erotic display?
3910,"Hey, I wonder if these guys are here to watch the erotic display too."
3913,Look how ridiculous they look.
3924,Hey! I can get any girl I want anytime I want. I'm just too busy.
3934,"Listen, Doc, if you wanna score you gotta fake like you're in love.  Just look her in the eye, start crying and say (fake crying) ""I've never been so happy""."
3937,"OK, you're on a date. What's the first thing you do?"
3939,No. Tell her she's special.
3941,"Well, tell her that. And then?"
3943,No. Make up some feelings and tell her you have them.  Yes?
3945,You're not even trying!
3947,"OK, OK, don't worry. The love meister will take you under his wing."
3949,"OK, go ahead."
3952,"(whispering) You just wanna talk, it has nothing to do with mating."
3955,(whispering) Start with a compliment: Tell her she looks thin.
3958,(whispering) Now ask her how her day was.
3960,(whispering) You wouldn't. Ask anyway.
3964,"(whispering) That's normal. Just nod your head and say ""Uh-huh"""
3968,(whispering) Third date!
3971,(whispering) Turn it over.
3974,That's the most beautiful thing I've ever heard.
3978,Nope. Must be some weird alien emotion.
3985,No thanks. I just came to tell you that Zoidberg's really great. He's got male jelly coming out the wazoo.
3987,"Uh, I'm flattered, really. If I was gonna do it with a big, freaky mud bug you'd be way up the list!"
3990,"Dr. Zoidberg, it's not how it looks."
3992,But--
3994,What?!
3996,English please?
4000,But I don't want her!
4006,Leela!
4011,Fatal.
4015,(shouting) Shut up!
4019,Shh! Nobody correct him!
4021,But it's a fight to the death!
4024,Uh-oh.
4026,Hey!
4029,Aha!  Oops!
4034,"My fellow fish monsters. Far be it for me to question your stupid civilisation or its dumb customs. But is squeezing each others brains out with a giant nutcracker really going to solve anything? Dr. Zoidberg is my friend. And though a woman has come between us, I say we'll always remain friends. And you know why?  One reason."
4035,You bastard! I'll kill you! You bastard!
4042,"Aw. I'm sorry, Doc."
4043,"Ow, ow! Ah!"
4045,I'll lend you this.
4047,"Hey, hey."
4050,You mean you have to choose between a life without sex and a gruesome death?
4052,Tough call.
4054,No biggie.
4058,(laughing) Yeah!
4060,"I don't mean to nitpick, super-doc, but do you think maybe you could take one more whack at this?"
4062,(from ship) My legs!
4071,No wonder you've been staying at the back of conga lines lately.
4077,"Yup, she's beautiful coffee alright."
4079,"Sorry, I'm not here to buy."
4081,I care! I care plenty! I just don't know how to make them stop!
4105,"Valentine's Day's coming? Oh, crap! I forgot to get a girlfriend again. Well since neither of us has a date, why don't we..."
4107,Shall we say 8 o'clock?
4109,"Yeah, OK. What's the weather like?"
4111,"So, what? Shorts?"
4112,"Boy, this A.C. is incredible!  I'd better turn on the heater too.  (shouting) Boy, this heater is incredible! I'd better turn up the A.C. some more."
4114,(shouting) Yeah!  We're slowing down!
4116,(shouting) Who wants pop-tarts?  Uh-oh!
4118,What are you doing?
4120,Phew!
4122,"Hey, tell me something: You've got all this money, how come you always dress like you're doing your laundry?"
4124,"I've been there. My folks were always on me to groom myself and wear underpants. What am I, the Pope?"
4126,"Yeah, it's like we feel the same way about junk and stuff, or, whatever."
4128,Yeah.
4131,Kind of.
4135,And it led there again when we got home.
4142,What? No!
4155,"(whispering) It's working, they think we're making out.  Wait, why aren't we making out?"
4163,Wow! We're great kissers!
4165,"Hey, yeah! I used to spit at stuff back in the 20th century. Ah, it's cool how we sort of think exactly alike, and junk."
4167,"Everything was going great. Then all of a sudden, she's talking about hanging out. Hangin out? She's getting way too serious. I'm not a one woman man, Leela."
4169,Don't you get it? She's smothering me.
4171,You see? You see? Now she's bothering me when I'm at work.
4173,I'm doing my job -- there's Amy. I spend a few hours selecting a candy from the machine -- there's Amy. I wake up the morning after sleeping with Amy -- there's Amy!
4175,"Am I? (shouting) Am I? (talking) Face it, I'm a prize catch.  I mean, I'm pulling down delivery boy money."
4177,"Then she wants me as a trophy husband. Leela, you gotta come to Europa with us, I can't be alone with her."
4179,"Hey, you know who loves secluded picnics with just you and me?  Uh, Dr. Zoidberg."
4183,"Jeez, we're already planning to spend Valentine's Day together. Isn't that enough?"
4185,"Oh, so all of a sudden we're spending Valentine's Day together?"
4187,"That's it, Amy, we have to talk. Zoidberg, you drive."
4189,"(from inside) Pardon me, excuse me."
4191,"Amy, you know how at first you like chocolate but then you start to get tired of it because it always wants to hang out with you?"
4193,"Look, could chocolate just let me finish?"
4195,"Amy, what I'm trying to say is, I think maybe you and I should stop--"
4198,Ow! My head is killing me. What happened? Was anybody hurt?
4200,How badly?
4202,Where is it?
4207,"Well, Amy, I'll try not to interfere with your life too much."
4209,"Ooh, sorry. I guess I control that arm."
4211,"Oh, that.  Maybe we'd better talk in private. (whispering) I'll meet you in the closet."
4212,"Amy, I really like you, as a friend. But I think we're spending too much time together."
4214,I just think we should start seeing other people.
4216,"I'm sorry, but it is."
4218,Huh?
4220,"Hey, I can get a date too. Now that I'm single, I'll attract all sorts of women!"
4222,(happy) Oh! (disappointed) Oh!
4231,"Oh, hey, Leela, uh, can I talk to you for a minute?  In private?"
4233,"This is an emergency. Amy made Valentine's plans with some goon and I'm gonna be stuck there, lonely and miserable. Will you be my date, please?"
4235,Then I have no choice but to do something so pitiful and embarrassing that I'm ashamed to tell you about it.
4237,Thanks.
4240,Why exactly did you shave your legs anyway? Are you expecting something to happen with your Valentine's date?
4242,And another thing: You're using an awful lot of make-up there.
4244,What does it do?
4247,20 minutes? You're practically ready now!
4249,"Oh, God, it's true!"
4252,(simultaneously) Thanks.  Where is she?
4255,I've got a date. She'll be along any minute.
4258,Uh--
4260,(whispering) She seems a little old for me.
4265,"Oh, yeah? Well I want one too."
4267,But you just said--
4277,"Well, ma'am I--"
4279,"No, but I control this arm."
4281,"Wait, come back, uh, darling."
4291,"Oh, jeez, get a room!"
4293,"Hey, I have an idea: Let's all go out for ice cream."
4299,Nooo!  That's it I'm gettin' the hell outta here.  Ooh! Ow!
4301,"Oh, Leela!"
4311,Can I live without it?
4314,"So, uh, thanks for the ride, Amy. And I hope there are no hard feelings about your date, or stuff."
4316,"Well, anyway, it's nice to have my own body back."
4318,"Seems to be. My neck's just a little tender.  Ow! Cool!  Ow! Listen, Leela. Thanks for rescuing me last night."
4326,I guess so.  Watch the neck! Watch the neck!
4352,Nah. If I ever wanna go back to the year 2000 I'll just freeze myself again.
4356,"Cool, it's just like the good old days!"
4358,"Hey Leela, get a picture of me being ""mugged."""
4366,"Yeah I asked a cop once. It means ""Up yours kid."""
4368,"Uh, sorry Bender that's just a phone booth."
4371,In New York? Bathrooms.
4374,I'll show you.  Whup.
4377,"No, it's a mobile apartment with no rent."
4382,We sometimes called it a jogging suit.
4388,"Hey, my girlfriend had one of those! Actually it wasn't her's it was her dad's. Actually she wasn't my girlfriend. She just lived next door and never closed her curtains."
4390,"C'mon, let's sneak in for a closer look."
4392,"Hey! This is from Miller's Outpo - uh, I mean, yeah, I work here alright!"
4395,Nope.  No one in New York drove. There was too much traffic.  Nice! Listen to that baby purr!
4397,It's just like riding a bicyc -
4401,I'm just glad we hit something. I thought we'd never stop.
4403,How's that robot I ran over?
4405,You mean he's -
4413,I don't get it.
4415,"So uh, Flexo. Sorry about crushing your body like that. You OK now?"
4417,Well just let me know if there's anything I can do to make it up to you.
4419,Uh...sure.
4421,How's that?
4423,Uh I can't get any lower than this.
4429,I don't like this place. It's 120 degrees and there's very little oxygen.
4432,"(unsure) Uh, yeah. Look at that exhaust fan."
4438,"Uh, no, that's alright.  Ow! Ow!"
4439,I'm telling you there's something about Flexo I don't like.
4442,Yeah keep laughing brineshrimp but he's bad news. I regret ever running him over.
4444,"He's much worse. He drinks, he smokes and he posts naked pictures of me on the internet."
4446,I'm talking about Flexo.
4448,No I'm not. Mark my words. Flexo's evil. He's the evil Bender.
4453,Can I touch it?
4468,"Uh, maybe we should stick with people we know and trust. I mean, Flexo's great but -"
4471,"Wait, I don't like the sound of that. Let's just go alphabetically."
4473,"Wait, let's go by rank."
4475,Flexo outranks me?
4478,Don't point that at me.
4480,"Look, I know Flexo's your friend but I don't trust him alone with the atom."
4482,I'm not prejudiced.
4488,Caught you!  I saw you looking at the atom!
4490,Oh-ho you'd like it if I went to sleep wouldn't you?
4492,Yeah well here's a funny joke. I'm gonna sit right here till it's my shift.
4494,That I will.
4496,Good.
4498,Good.
4500,Good.  Good.
4501,"Well, that's eight hours."
4503,"Finally, the atom is safe."
4505,No.
4509,He must have used a sleep ray on me. Sleep rays exist in the future right?
4511,Then I must've fallen asleep.
4518,Aha!  Uh searching...hmm.
4520,I didn't find him here 10 minutes ago so I thought it was time to check again.
4522,"(suspicious) Say Bender, can I hold that map for a second?"
4524,Give it up!
4529,"Or maybe, he never left at all!  Wait a minute. You're Bender."
4531,"But why were you wearing that scarf, that turtleneck and this fruity number?"
4539,"100,000?"
4543,"Well, we'll be leaving now. If you'll just sign this form saying you received the atom."
4548,Flexo!
4556,Flexo! Shoot Flexo!
4560,Bender? You stole the atom?
4563,"Whoa whoa, you mean Bender is the evil Bender? I am shocked, shocked! Well not that shocked."
4566,I'm so confused. The Bender I liked turn out to be evil and the Bender I hated was good. How can I live my life when I can't tell good from evil?
4580,"Well, you guys might both be losers but I just made out with that radiator woman from the radiator planet."
4582,Oh.  Is there a burn ward within 10 feet of here?
4587,"Hey, Hermes!"
4594,Hermes has all the fun. Wait a second! He's got a Brain Slug on his head!
4601,"Hey, yeah!"
4603,"Cool, let's see this one!"
4608,"Yeah, I wanna see that."
4610,I'll take a small Slurm.
4612,"Uh, OK.  Oh, man!"
4616,"(sarcastic) Ooh, this is real futuristic!"
4630,No I didn't!
4660,Hey! How come when I wanna do fun stuff that'll kill me you're against it?
4679,(shouting) Bender rules!
4681,"Wow! Thanks, Hermes!  I-- Hey! Cut that out!"
4725,"Man, I thought Ultimate Robot Fighting was real, like pro wrestling. But it turns out it's fixed, like boxing."
4776,Bender? How did the fight go? I heard somebody got flattened!
4793,Hey!
4795,My God! It's full of ads!
4797,It's immense.
4799,So I see!
4820,"Well, thanks to the internet, I'm bored with sex. Is there a place on the web that panders to my lust for violence?"
4832,Oh Leela. I feel terrible. If there's anything I can ever do -  Gotcha!  I won! I'm the greatest!
4834,Are you still mad at me for wrecking your once in a lifetime chance to learn the meaning of your existence?
4839,Kicked your ass!
4841,Too bad we gotta make that urgent popcorn delivery.
4846,Lazy sculptor!
4856,"Hmm, you got any sacred artwork of her from the back?"
4860,What's over that hill?
4862,Is that anything like a cemetary 'cause I gotta take a leak.  Ow!
4864,Ow!
4896,Mmm! Great pancakes Leela!
4906,He may be some lowlife jerk but I don't trust him. I think he's hiding something and I'm gonna find out what it is.
4907,Try and stop me!
4918,"'Cause I think Alkazar's hding something. Listen Leela, you may not like it, you may not believe it, you may not wanna hear it but Alkazar's a jerk, he's bad for you. He -"
4920,You do?
4922,Then dump his one eyed ass.
4925,I'll be there.
4928,C'mon Leela you deserve better than this guy! Dump him already!
4933,Ohh!
4938,"Pst, Leela. you've got to get me out of here. It's horrible, eating scraps, letting my waste drop wherever it falls like an animal in the zoo."
4940,The corner! Why didn't I think of that?
4942,That's it! It's time for this bird to walk.
4943,Bender come on. We've got to get some dirt on Alkazar. Lets go and find out what makes the Forbidden Valley so forbidden.
4945,But there's probably some cool forbidden stuff you can steal.
4947,"Bender, snap out of it!"
4950,"Come on boy, jump!  Good boy!"
4952,My God! Four identical castles!
4954,"That's weird. It's another Cyclops, only this one has five eyes."
4965,"Hey Alkazar, you left somebody off the guest list."
4968,Oh yeah? Then what about this?
4974,And maybe you'd like to meet her.  And her.
4988,"Hey, that's what I do."
4997,I'll play.
5002,"Wow, you look happy. Is someone fired?"
5006,Jamaican? I thought you were some kinda outer space potato man.
5016,What's with the specs Bender?
5018,Hey!
5021,"It doesn't matter how many human females you have, Bender's on a hot streak."
5023,Oh man!
5038,Aw hey c'mon don't worry. We'll watch you clean up.
5080,"Uh, I can explain that. See, it used to be milk and, well, time makes fools of us all."
5082,"Uh wait, this is the other Fry's locker. I'm Phry with a ""Ph."""
5083,What the hell's going on? I thought you were anti-dirty not pro-dirty.
5087,Just like very other girl I've dated.
5097,All right!
5104,Morgan? It's 3am.
5106,Eat and sleep.
5108,"Uh wait, Bender's my rooommate. He could be back any second."
5112,"Morgan, come back! He's stuck in a loop!"
5119,"Hey, what did you do to him?"
5121,"But, but...Bender need brain...for...smart making!  What did you do now? Stop doing things!"
5123,"No, he was a bad friend. I want him back right now."
5125,I'm sick of you and your bureaucracy.
5128,I couldn't help it. She loved me because of the part of me that's a slob and I loved her because of the part of me that's desperate.
5129,Poor Bender. Without his brain he's become all quiet and helpful. We've got to go to the Central Bureaucracy and get that disk back!
5140,"Man, how long is this gonna take?"
5151,
5162,We'll never find that disk will we Bender?
5163,You're right. Nothing is over so long as there's one thin ray of hope.
5165,"Listen Morgan, We're through, you're an evil heartless woman and I never wanna see you again. However would you help us get Bender back for old times sake?"
5197,Yeah!
5203,"That's right, she fraternized me!"
5210,What about me? Can I come back at severely reduced pay?
5232,"Oh.  Thank you. Y'know, when I was first asked to make a film about my nephew, Professor Farnsworth, I thought ""Why should I?"" Then later Leela made the film. But if I had made the film, you could bet there would have been a lot more topless women on motorcycles! Roll film!"
5233,(whispering) Dork alert!
5241,Leela! He could live another 100 years!
5243,"Wow, a whole planet of old people. Where is it?"
5248,A successor?
5251,"Man, the Professor's been in his lab for days."
5259,Sorry everyone but need I remind you? Blood is thicker than water.
5267,One foot in the grave.
5269,Oh yeah!
5272,Crud. Can I at least be in charge of your dentures?
5274,Where did Cubert come from?
5283,"Well, once in the park."
5295,Little twerp.
5341,We've gotta get him back.
5343,"Nothing is impossible. You'd know that if you really took after the Professor, like I do."
5345,Uh...what?
5353,"To the left!  No to the up!  U-turn, U-turn!"
5358,I'm on it!
5361,I'd like to see them find it!
5365,'Cause you're too ugly to be a wart.
5371,"What? I'm old. Listen. (old man voice) Hey you kids, get off the lawn!"
5379,Uh....I-I've got talking hump syndrome.
5385,So this is where they stick old people. It's horrific.
5400,Will too.
5402,"Come on Leela, step your big boot down on the gas pedal."
5404,Fix it fix it fix it fix it fix it fix it! Fix it fix it fix it!
5406,Try shocking him.
5408,"Damnit, we'll have to fix the engine ourself."
5420,So what were they doing to you in that awful drawer?
5446,This contest is as good as over. I once caught a fish this big.
5455,"(whispering) Quiet, Bender, you're scaring away the fish."
5457,I can hit a fish between the eyes from 20 yards!
5459,A shrimp?  I find it a bit hard to believe that--
5463,"Hey, a fish this fine belongs in a fish nugget-style chunklet. And anyway, it's bigger than anything you've caught. Ow! My small intestine!"
5468,"(shouting) Hey, Bender, I just caught a fish this big!"
5486,It's diving!
5492,How many atmospheres can this ship withstand?
5496,How do we do that?
5499,"Wait, I'll be back in a minute."
5501,Did what?
5507,I'd better go too. They don't know what I like.
5510,I can't swallow that.
5520,(blubberling) Mermaid.
5524,A mermaid!
5526,"No, I did see a mermaid! She was wearing a tube top and she had a beautiful scaley tail. And I think she had hair extensions."
5531,"What's so far-fetched about mermaids? I mean, there's all sorts of weird sea creatures here in the future. Like Dr. Zoidberg."
5533,"Every time something good happens to me you say it's some kind of madness, or I'm drunk, or I ate too much candy. Well I saw a real mermaid and I wish for once my friends would have decency and kindness to believe me."
5536,"(muttering) Ocean madness, yeah right. It's always something, ain't it?  (talking) It's her! Bender, wake up! She's here! Wake up!  Oh! oxygen!"
5538,"Hey! I can breath and talk, just like a fish!"
5540,What?
5542,"I'm Fry. So, uh, am I gonna drown?"
5544,"Aw, yeah!"
5546,I can't believe you're really real. I like your tail.
5548,"Oh, Thanks. They're called pants."
5550,No kidding.
5552,"Sure, sometimes it falls from the sky."
5554,And sometimes it doesn't.
5556,"You know what I like best about you, Umbriel? You find me fascinating even when I'm not claiming to be a jewel thief or a lion tamer."
5558,Yup. We call them land-sealions ... I tame them!
5578,"Hey, you guys, the most amazing thing happened. It's two-for-one Tuesday at Krispy Kreme! Plus there's mermaids."
5581,I think it was just an airport. They had a place where you could buy nuts.
5583,"That's right, honey! Whatever you say."
5593,"Aw, shucks, Colonel."
5596,Wait. I'm not going with you.
5600,Realise it? I don't even understand it!
5602,I don't care. I'm staying. I've got everything I want right here.
5605,"Sorry, Zoidberg. I'm trying to join the country club."
5617,"You know, Umbriel, these last 24 hours have been the happiest days of my life."
5619,Mercy! I do believe I'm gettin' the vapours!
5621,Yeah I'm a little confused too. How do I ... y'know ... with the tail and all?
5623,"(gasping) Why couldn't she be the other type of mermaid, with the fish part on top and the lady part on the bottom?"
5628,Wait! Wait for me! Don't leave me here!
5635,"Well, it turns out I loved her, but I wasn't in love with her."
5639,"Ow! Bender, you're hurting me. Ow!"
5680,"No. In fact, it looks so nice I think I might get one too."
5684,(cheering) Yeah!
5693,No thanks. That's robot food.
5695,No really I don't -  Mmm!
5710,$1200?
5717,"No, I was just picking my nose."
5731,He's made of candy.
5733,(cheering) Alright!
5813,But we're about to take off. We gotta eat our blastoff sundaes.
5815,Bender's sick.  Need any help taking off?
5826,"Wow, it's too bad you can't see Leela 'cause theres a cool ship out there shooting at somebody."
5828,"Uh, Leela?"
5836,"Great, great. The one time I forgot to buy flight insurance."
5842,Unless you let us live. Then you'll get off scot free.
5854,No!
5857,"(whispering) Oh no, poor Bender."
5864,"Leela, we may not have much time left......so let's spend all of it reminscing about Bender. He was like a big computer than ran on magic."
5867,You're OK!
5872,"I'm telling you, Leela was cool, she was in command, and when she kicked people it hurt. It really hurt."
5880,It's funny Bender. With you sick and Leela blind only I know what really went on out there. Maybe someday I'll tell you the whole story.
5886,"I hate the Planet of the Moochers. They take you out for a drink, but when the check comes, their wallet's always in their other pants - which they borrowed from me!"
5889,Ugh!
5892,Maybe that planet over there has a drive-thru. A Burger Jerk or a Fishy Joe's or a Chizzler or something.
5896,I'm experienced at foraging. I used to find edible mushrooms on my bath mat.
5900,Here's something. It looks like a ditch full of fried shrimp.
5903,"Well? How are they?  Oh, they're great! They're like sex! Except I'm having them!"
5905,Look! Here's more!
5907,Let's bring back a couple of pocketfuls.
5922,"I know, we'll call them Popplers!"
5926,Swish!
5929,"Hey, yeah."
5932,"Hey, business is great."
5941,Wow! You're some guy who eats at Fishy Joe's?
5945,A dollar a dozen.
5948,How do we sign?
5952,Leela! That's the second billboard you've crashed into this week!
5983,"Look, Leela, even if you heard one talk, that doesn't mean it's intelligent. I mean, parrots talk and we eat them, right?"
5985,Like Fry! Like Fry!
5995,"People, I won't let you enter. Popplers are as intelligent as you or me."
5999,Turanga?
6061,I wish they'd just wipe out humanity and get it over with. It's the waiting I can't stand.
6073,"What Bender means is, you're really brave, and smart, and beautiful, and a great friend."
6080,You mean -
6088,That's Leela!
6117,No!
6140,"Hear, hear!"
6144,"Mmm, let me get some of that suckling pig."
6148,
6172,"Man, there's clouds of exhaust everywhere."
6179,Not really.
6184,"Hey, who's this guy?"
6186,"I'm sorry, I-I thought you were made of wax."
6188,"I mean, I thought you were one of the wax robots."
6192,"Hey, Bender. Here's an exhibit about Mom's favourite robot."
6227,"Yeah, uh, I'd like a cup of coffee, please."
6229,"Yes, please."
6231,"Oh, uh, OK."
6233,"Yes, uh, eight spoons."
6235,"Uh, Leela, I think there might be something wrong with the coffee machine."
6246,Violent media? What a load of -
6251,No!
6265,"Well, we can live without machines. I was in Webelos."
6268,"In my time, we didn't depend on high-tech gadgets like you do. We didn't need a mechanical washing unit to wash our clothes. We just used a washing machine. And look: You don't need an electric can-opener to feed yourself. All you need is a trusty Swiss Army knife. Ow!  (crying) I'm hungry!"
6289,"W-W-Wait. You mean, you, and Mom?"
6303,"Hey, the TV's getting away!"
6313,"Professor, please. The fate of the world depends on you getting to second base with Mom."
6322,"Wait. In my time, we had a way of moving things long distances without hovering."
6324,It was called...let me think. It was really famous - Ruth Gordon had one. The wheel!
6327,There. Finished!
6331,"(snappy) It's my invention, we do it my way! Now all we need is something to pull it and we're set!"
6333,Ow!
6337,"And if that doesn't work, I got you a six-pack of champagne and a funnel."
6349,Yes!
6368,Nothing in here but a couple of elephant skin rugs.
6372,There it is!
6374,Is anything not a robot?
6384,"Hurry, Bender. Get the bra!"
6402,Ooh!
6406,"Yeah, it's really long. But what did you just turn on with it?"
6408,Does it really work?
6413,I'm so lonely since I came to the future. Will you be my friend?  Ow!
6414,Who are you?
6416,You too? Will you be my friend?
6419,"(shouting) Stop! The robot's not your enemy! He's just a poor, misunderstood--"
6435,"Hey, Bender?"
6437,Wanna make Shrinky Dinks?
6440,"Goodnight, sweet prince."
6445,"Yeah, be more impulsive. Like this."
6485,Ew! What smells like boot feet?
6490,"I'm bored. You're boring, Zoidberg. I'm gonna go watch TV."
6492,Whatcha eating?
6494,"Sure.  Y'know, I think I finally figured out what's behind all these mysterious deaths."
6496,Was Planet Express built on an Indian graveyard?
6498,No?
6500,Then ... then ... it was you!
6502,"Well, that covers the first three killings."
6505,I like it!
6507,I really like it!
6509,"Um, I have a question. What if Bender was really giant?"
6511,I know. I liked it. I wanna see it again.
6513,"Oh, alright. How 'bout this? What if I never fell into that freezer-doodle and came to the future-jiggy?"
6515,"Hello? Pizza delivery for ... Icy Wiener?! Aw, crud!  Here's to another lousy Millennium! Ow!  I should have left you floating in the toilet!"
6519,Who are you monsters? Is one of you Icy Wiener?
6521,"You believe me about the monsters, right, Mr. Panucci?"
6525,Hey! Stephen Hawking! Aren't you that physicist that invented gravity?
6527,"Let me ask you something: Has anyone ever discovered a hole in nothing with monsters in it?  'Cause if I'm the first, I want them to call it ""a Fry Hole""."
6532,(from alley) Who said that?  Hey! What the--? Ooh! Ow! Ow!
6533,Who are you people?
6535,I thought your duty was to cast the tie-breaking vote in the Senate.
6537,Hmm. So I guess you'll wanna see my Fry Hole.
6545,"Where am I, anyway?"
6548,So what do you nerds want?
6551,No fair! I saw it first!
6556,So then my chair tilted back and I almost fell into this freezer thingy.
6558,"But instead of falling in and getting frozen, I missed and wanged my head."
6560,"Uh, what?"
6565,Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
6573,Alright. But I need a weapon to fight off drunken robots when I wake up.
6575,"OK, here I go."
6577,Eh? What's the worst thing that can happen?
6579,Destroyed? Then where are we now?
6583,Sure.
6588,Good work.
6601,"Oh, I'm sorry, Bender. When's the funeral?"
6637,"Bender, wake up!  He's OK! Quick, does anyone have any liquor?"
6640,"Poor Bender, you're seeing things. You've been drinking too much, or too little, I forget how it works with you. Anyway, you haven't drunk exactly the right amount."
6661,"Aw, relax buddy. You were probably just shooting some big, fuzzy craps."
6663,"Geez Bender, you're scaring me. You're going wacko!"
6684,I wouldn't wanna be me right now.
6689,"It'll be a rich, full day."
6691,"(shouting) Bender, no!"
6693,(shouting) You jerk. I thought I was your best friend. What kind of two-timing kill-mobile are you?
6694,"I can't believe this. Bender is supposed to murder his closest friend, which I thought was me. But he went straight for you. He didn't even try to second-degree murder me."
6696,Stop rubbing it in.
6698,"Not physically. But why don't you ask your new best friend, Leela?"
6702,"Words. Nothing sweet, sweet words that turn into bitter orange wax in my ears."
6704,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
6708,"Thanks, eagle eye."
6720,I once had a best friend who liked to smell things with me.
6728,"Look, are you the original were-car or not?"
6733,Knight Rider wasn't evil.
6749,"Hey, Project Satan! Over here! I'm a blind pedestrian. 20 points!"
6753,"(gasping) Yes! He chose me! He's trying to kill me! Leela, I'm so happy!  (talking) Oh, thanks Bender.  (choking) Too tight! Too tight!"
6758,"Bender, I'm alive!  You didn't hurt me at all. But I know you wanted to, and that's what matters.  Here's to you."
6760,"I'll kill you too, buddy. I'll kill you too!"
6763,"Hm, Spider, Hubble, Nitrogum...ooh, Big Pink! It's the only gum with the breath-freshening power of ham."
6766,I believe you're forgetting about our 5% military discount.
6771,"Full price for gum? That dog won't hunt, Monsignor."
6774,"Just out of curiosity, we could use the cards to buy gum, then immediately quit the army, right?"
6777,What's that?
6790,And this ham gum is all bone.
6793,Cool effect!
6797,"Uh, just so we'll know, who's the enemy?"
6801,Whoa! Check out that guy. He makes Speedy Gonzales look like Regular Gonzales.
6816,Mind if we sit with you?
6818,Good point...I guess.
6821,"Well, I sort of a have a thing for this girl I work with."
6823,Cyclops.
6832,It's creepy here.
6834,And then the battle's not so bad?
6836,What's happening?
6838,The enemy! They're balls!
6840,"Oh, right."
6847,(shouting) Bender! No!
6859,That wasn't cowardice.
6863,That doesn't sound too bad.
6892,"(singing) I'm walking on sunshine, whoa-oh."
6912,What's the word...uh...sir?
6914,We don't have long!
6918,"OK, I gotta break down that gate, beat up those three guards, steal that chopper and rescue Bender.  Hey, I did it! Wait, that's not me."
6920,"You wanna save him too, Lemon? You barely know him."
6922,Hermes?
6926,Leela!
6934,"OK, my best friend's life is at stake. I can finally prove that I'm not a coward. Will you push me?"
6936,"(shouting) Thank you!  At last, war has made me into a man."
6940,Stop! You can't say the next word.
6942,"Bender, if you say the A-word and you'll blow this planet straight to the H-word!"
6948,"All right! Hey. Wait a minute! This is your home planet? We're the evil, invading aliens?"
6963,No.
6968,Bender!
6974,"Giant Space Robot, this is Captain Fry of the USS Planet Express Ship; We come in peace."
6976,"Well, we destroyed the toy spaceship. Now what are we gonna do?"
6978,Do you think we should?
6987,"Woo, yeah!"
6990,That's the best thing I ever saw!
6994,That was great!
6999,"Yeah, Leela."
7009,"What are we supposed to do for money? All I've got is my frequent taffy eater's card, my first moustache......and this picture of me and my old girlfriend, Michelle, and that ski instructor she was just friends with."
7012,"Well, what do you suggest? A daring daylight robbery of Fort Knox on elephant-back? That's the dumbest thing I ever heard!"
7016,Our what?
7018,And then what happened?
7020,Ow!
7028,They're OK.
7033,"Hey, I was frozen. I think I know what people wanna hear when they first wake up.  Bathroom's that way."
7034,"So, while you're on the Probulator, tell me, what brings you to the future?"
7036,"Nope. Straight line.  Ah, the Probulator's done."
7038,"Oh, wait, it hasn't started yet.  OK, it's about to start."
7044,Nothing like a power nap.
7047,I ordered a pizza.
7049,"Sorry, but if it's not here in half an hour, it's free."
7051,"Well, uh, I've got 33 minutes."
7053,"OK, I'll fight the box. I think I can take him."
7057,"No.  No!  Oh, my God! It's Pauly Shore!"
7059,"Mr. Shore, I loved you in Bio-Dome. You sure caused some trouble in that bubble!"
7061,"Hey, now that you're in the future, you can go live in an actual bio-dome!"
7063,Oh.  How did you wind up getting frozen?
7065,The weasel?
7067,I woke you up early so we could hang out and do stuff.
7069,I love this job.
7071,Showtime! (hoarse) I'll pretend to be dying of space plague.
7073,Michelle!
7076,I don't know. Is it really you?
7078,Who wants to know?
7080,"I don't get it, Michelle. The last time I saw you, you were doing great. You had just dumped me and you were well on your way to getting you life back on track. Why'd you freeze yourself?"
7082,I'm sorry.
7084,Sorry.
7086,"Uh, sorry."
7088,(voice-over) Sorry.
7090,I'm sorry.
7092,Aww. So you froze yourself to come look for me?
7094,"That's the same reason they kept me out of school. So, no one even cared that I was gone?"
7096,Who was it?
7098,Not everything. There's still a roach problem.
7101,"Nowadays, people aren't interested in art that's not tattooed on fat guys."
7112,"Hey, guys."
7115,"I'm glad you're all here. I wanted to introduce you to my on-again-off-again girlfriend of the past thousand years, Michelle.  Michelle, this is Leela. This is Bender.  The professor.  Hermes and Amy."
7117,And this is Dr. Zoidberg.
7119,All what?
7122,"But things are different this time. Before, she was demanding and possessive. But now she wants me to do stuff and stay with her all the time."
7131,"Yeah, they're great, huh?"
7133,"Oh, right. I was supposed to assign you a job. Let me just get your career chip installed.  Hold out your palm. What are you scared of? It's just like getting your hand pierced."
7135,"Ooh, romantic. I'll tell Bender to meet us there."
7137,"Whoa, whoa, girl. I thought you were talking about one of those motels where the bed is shaped like stuff."
7139,"Well, sure. To the extent a man can love a woman. But this seems like a big step."
7141,You're right. Let's do this now and let's never regret it.
7142,"Michelle, I don't regret this. But I both rue and lament it."
7143,The year 4000 is severely disappointing. I miss the year 3000 when life was simple and brains flew through space and everyone ate lasers.
7145,"No, you brought us here."
7147,"Alright, fine. Everything else sucks. At least we can have a nice place to live."
7148,"Ooh, there."
7150,"It'd be deeper, but I'm standing on a gopher."
7152,They'll save us.  We're saved!
7155,"Mighty sir, we have nowhere to go. Could we please join your society?"
7157,"I tell you, that Butch runs a pretty good civilisation. I think I'll enjoy serving under him."
7159,"What do I need, ulcers?"
7161,"Alright, alright. If it'll make you happy, I'll overthrow society."
7163,"Well, I'm older than you. I can beat you up."
7167,What's death rolling?
7170,"Oh, so it's a little safer than skateboarding."
7173,(sadly) Beth said that?
7176,Aww. Poor little guy. Let me just take a look at - aha!  I won! I'm the new chief! I'm the tallest and I weigh the most!
7183,"I find this post-apocalyptic wasteland very confusing. Seriously, I'm weirded out."
7185,"Yeah, but in the year 3000, I had it all. Several friends, a low-paying job, a bed in a robot's closet. I envied no man. But you wrecked everything."
7187,"Oh, yeah? Well, listen to this: (whispering) I'm leaving you."
7188,There must be people somewhere.
7189,Yes! Footprints! And hand prints?  But? What's happening?
7191,Leela? What are you guys doing here in the year 4000?
7196,So you're saying these aren't the decaying ruins of New York in the year 4000?
7198,But there was this gang of 10-year olds with guns.
7200,But everyone is driving around in cars shooting at each other.
7202,But the air's green and there's no sign of civilisation whatsoever.
7204,"And the people are all phoneys. No one reads. Everything has cilantro on it -  Michelle, baby!"
7207,"That's it. I've had it with women. From now on, I'm concentrating on my career. Can I have my old job back?"
7219,A tomato.
7221,"Eh, what's the worst thing that could happen?  Ugh, it's like there's a party in my mouth and everyone's throwing up!"
7225,That jerk! No one hoots at my captain unless they're prepared to take it to the next level!
7228,Hey jumbo! How would you like it if Leela said you were sexy and she wanted to make love with you?
7230,You take that back! She does not look good for a truck stop chick!
7232,She does too! She's loaded with meat! She's got more meat than a cow!  Ow!
7234,I can't please Leela no matter what I do! I just want her to like me.
7243,Well my lead pipe hurts a little?
7247,No.
7249,I've had better.
7284,What about what?
7286,I'd love to!
7292,"Ah, the scent of a rose. Curious how an aromatic chain of hydrocarbons can evoke our deepest emotions.  For you."
7311,"I don't think so.  Sir, I believe you owe this lady an apology."
7327,Anything.
7329,"Leela, there's something I've wanted to tell you for a long time but every time I try I get nervous and my mouth feels like it's stuffed with peanut butter, even when it's not."
7331,"No, it's about you and me."
7333,Bender's not involved.  Leela...I love you.
7335,Yes. But it's only recently I've been able to articulate my thoughts. I love you Leela and I always have.
7337,Yeah! I don't know why but my life really turned around that day!
7340,Please......I need something to settle my stomach.
7354,"If anyone wants to tell me what's going on here, I'll be in the lounge."
7355,"Of all the parasites I've had over the years, these worms are among the - hell! They are the best! Leela, how can I ever repay you for saving them?"
7358,Apartment 1I. The old me would have made a joke about that!
7360,I think the view's perfect already.
7362,Wait. In a minute.
7364,They don't have you to inspire them.
7366,"When I'm with you, everyday seems like double-soup Tuesday."
7368,What I've become.
7370,There's just something I have to find out.
7371,Who controls this bowel?
7374,You mean colon?
7376,"Your excellency, have you ever been in love?"
7378,"Well, a wonderful girl loves me. But I need to know if it's really me she loves, or just what you worms have made of me. That's why with all due respect, I'm asking you to leave."
7380,Everyone out of my body or the brain gets it!
7382,"Obviously you've never been in love! Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Now, the hand-eye co-ordination lobe."
7385,"I was just working my way towards the medulla oblongata - control centre of the heart and lungs. And if I kill myself, you die with me."
7387,"I hope Satan has a nice colon, 'cause that's where you're gonna be living!"
7390,"I'm about to.  Leela, let me play for you one for time."
7392,"Please, it's important to me."
7394,I don't know. I got nervous and started thinking about neck bolts.  Wow! Did you see that vase break? It was all like -
7396,Nothing. I got rid of the worms.
7398,"Leela, I had worms. I needed to know who you loved. Me or them."
7400,"I did. I think. It was probably about 50/50. But that's how I really felt about you, I swear!"
7402,"Please. Give me a chance to be romantic on my own. I've got a baggy of massage oil, and I'm gonna give you my super back rub, just like a I used to give Amy when I was going out with her, and she always seemed... - Uh-oh!"
7404,"Well, at least I learned Leela's a lost cause. I give up."
7410,He's got me beat!
7416,He's dead.
7508,I can't believe Leela and Amy aren't back yet from their half-date. I'm gonna call the restaurant.
7510,We gotta go rescue them!
7512,Bender! Think of the señoritas!
7524,"Oh, no! Any sign of Leela or Amy?"
7526,I don't know. But it might have something to do with this.
7529,"Alright, here's the plan--"
7533,Pfft. A female leader?
7535,"Yes, captain!"
7551,Is she hot?
7553,"In other words, ""No"".  Ow!"
7563,"It was an accident, ma'am."
7565,"Leela, I'm through making fun of women. Now I want them to help me."
7575,What'd they die of?
7577,Yes!
7580,(cheering) Yay!
7583,Although the snu-snu part's gonna be pretty good.
7597,"Goodbye, friends. I never thought I would die like this. But I'd always really hoped."
7606,(from inside) Ooh! Yeah!
7623,Can't we just cuddle?  (screaming) Nooo!
7641,"Oh, yeah!"
7651,Making the noise.
7656,Yep.
7661,"That doesn't look like an ""L"" at all. Unless you count lowercase."
7665,Who would do a thing like that?
7682,Huh?
7688,Wait! There on the screen. It's that guy you are.
7691,You weren't sleepwalking. You were sleep-bending!
7697,You're only four years old?
7737,"Professor, I've never seen you so cheerful. What the hell's wrong with you?"
7739,I wish! It's a nickel.
7745,Alright!
7759,She sure does.
7774,Yeah. Either that or be a man.
7776,That's thinkin' like a man.
7855,"Professor, we're all sick of your upbeat attitude."
7873,"Man, that's dog's gonna be hard to beat. Look at him bring in the sheep! One sheep, two sheep......three sheep."
7882,I love these things!
7892,"Don't listen to them, Leela. People said I was dumb, but I proved them."
7898,Looks like this planet is next in line.
7900,I'd hate to be those guys.
7905,Leela back yet?
7907,You don't have a heart; you're a robot.
7909,"Well, yeah. Robots are made of metal."
7911,"Bender, if this is some kind of scam, I don't get it. You already have my power of attorney."
7914,Dr. Zoidberg? Why is everyone acting so weird?
7916,(angry) I just let you back in!
7924,"Man, even the news monster is acting strange. What are we gonna do?"
7929,Wait a minute! I know what's going on here. You've all become idiots!
7952,Attention New New Yorkers. Stop acting so stupid!
7966,"Time to re-educate you duncebags. We'll start with US presidents.  This is our first president, George Washington. Let's review. Who was our first president?"
7970,Leela! I've been so worried. Are you a bonehead?
7972,"Whoa, whoa! Slow down. You're going a mile a minute."
7974,Thanks!
7979,"No, Leela. Brain make people smart."
7981,Even bigger than those? Holy nuts! Where is it?
7983,Hm. A giant brain is basically a giant nerd. And where would a giant nerd be? The libary!
7985,I'm here to kick your ass.
7987,"That's right. And I think you'll find that a little knowledge is a dangerous thing!  OK, better think of a new plan. Come on, Fry, think!  Thinking...thinking..."
7989,"Hey! Thinking hurts him. Maybe I can think of a way to use that.  Aha! Prepare to be thought at. Leela, give me a topic."
7991,"Seriously, I can't think of anything. Gotta find something to make me think. (reading) Hardy Boys. (talking) Too easy. (reading) Nancy Drew. (talking) Too hard. Aha! Perfect! Bonfire of the Vanities!"
7996,Take that! And that! This sentence I don't understand but take this one!
7999,Where are we?
8004,"Queequeg, let go of me! I have to kill it!"
8006,Follow him! It's our only way out!
8007,"Excuse me, have you seen a giant brain?"
8011,(shouting) Come on!
8013,Tou think I'm an oddity? Wait'l you see --
8020,"Hey, Brain-y, think fast!"
8023,"Leela, I've got an idea. Stay here with Queequeg."
8025,"Yes! I'm free!  Alright, Brain. Get ready for some electroshock treatment!"
8027,"Leela cried for her lost love as Fry lay dead under the heavy bookcase. The Big Brain laughed in triumph......Then, for no reason, he left Earth forever. The end.  There!  Now he's trapped in a book I wrote: A crummy world of plot holes and spelling errors."
8031,I did it!  And it's all thanks to the books at my local library.
8041,(cheering) Alright!
8095,He promised he'd give his Uncle Zoid a million bucks to make a movie.
8098,Since when have you been in the biz?
8135,"Leela, we're missing the premiere. My only goal in life was to attend a Hollywood shindig. Just pay the valet the two bucks."
8157,"Well, we missed the premiere and we're gonna die. We might as well enjoy the sights.  Oh my God, Sylvester Stallone!"
8172,It's been two weeks. You wanna play tic-tac-toe again before we eat our shoes?
8174,What was that? A tar dolphin or a tar shark?
8176,"Alright, but I still feel like having a shoe."
8201,We made it! I'm at a Hollywood party!
8212,Controversial?
8221,"Alright, she's all restocked with emergency jam. Let's get going."
8228,Bender?
8231,No fair. Leela was training me to be captain. She even let me sit in her lap and steer - in this comic I drew.
8238,I am at ease.
8259,Would you cram a sock in it Bender? Those aren't even medals! They're bottlecaps and pepperoni slices.
8261,"Fine, I've got a toast. To Captain Bender! He's the best......at being a big jerk and his big ugly face is as dumb as a butt."
8263,If I were in charge I wouldn't treat you like this. You're nothing but a big blowhard.
8265,Being captain is obviously more important to you than being my friend. I'm going.
8277,What's happening?
8279,Oh the fools! If only they'd built it with 6001 hulls! When will they learn?
8302,"You ate most of them. So, where's Captain Bender? Off catastrophising some other planet?"
8305,He didn't?
8307,"Wait. Let me. Bender and I have our disagreements, but we're still friends and I'm gonna show him what that means. To the ship."
8309,"Madam, I am in command now."
8316,Then where are we? You said you knew how to navigate.
8373,Granted. We can't take off without our captain.
8375,"So Leela, were you able to help the penguins?"
8377,(mumbling) I 'unno.
8398,(shouting) C'mon!
8403,I'll tell you when my horse finishes...bad.
8408,"Come on, come on! Hey Leela, how 'bout a kiss for good luck?  I meant tongue luck."
8409,I am so unlucky! I've run over black cats that were luckier than me.
8421,"Dear Horse God, I know I don't usually pray to you, sometimes I doubt you even exist. But if you're willing to grant me luck, please, stamp your hoof once. Come on number six move it!  Don't do that! What are you -  Man it's contagious!"
8423,"That's it! You can only take my money for so long before you take it all, and I say enough.  I've got one dollar left, and this one I'm holding onto! Oh no you don't!  I may not know much about horses but I know a lot about doing anything for one dollar!  If you think bad luck can defeat me then you don't know my name is Philip J -"
8425,Kareem's got the skyhook but Philip J. Fry's got the spacehook!
8427,Hey. That's my patented spacehook! You stole it!
8429,Holy camolie! A seven leaf clover!
8431,Phil wins! Yancy's fans are stunned! There'll be no celebration at the Yancy dome!
8435,Pah. I'd have won a lot of money too if I still had my lucky seven leaf clover. Plus I'd still have my hair.
8438,I hid it in a secret hiding place who's location I never told anyone. Not even Scruffy.
8440,Hey yeah! Maybe it is still there! Underground in the ruins of Old New York. Helping some ant defeat another ant or helping some piece of dirt turn it's luck around.
8442,I'm going down there to get my clover back. Now some of the tunnels have metal bars so I'll need someone who's good at bending. Leela how 'bout you?
8445,It is?
8447,Here's the entrance.  From this moment on I declare my bad luck officially over.
8450,"Look, up ahead."
8452,"Wow! We've got Manhattan all to ourselves! I can finally do all the crazy stuff I always dreamed of doing!  Howard Stern s overrated!  Uh, oops!"
8454,And remember when Mayor Giuliani cracked down on jaywalking?
8456,"Well Rudy, how'd you like this action?"
8458,Cosmic F.
8460,Outer space.
8462,The moonwalk...the robot...the zero
8467,Deep space??
8470,Hey!
8472,The robot? That's similar to mine!
8474,What are you doing? You totally ripped off my routine.
8476,Why do you always have to steal everything from me Yancy? Find your own life and live it.
8478,Well I'd like to see you try and steal this. the septuple head spin.
8480,"Oh yeah? Noticeably F.A.T., rewind the tape."
8486,"Alright team, let's go find that clover!"
8488,"71st street? Hmm, never heard of it. Downtown could be in any direction."
8492,"Gosh my old neighbourhood!  That's the bench where I found some shirts!  That fire hydrant! In summer we'd light it on fire! On that corner, some guy with a bushy beard handed out a socialist newsletter!"
8494,You'd better believe it!
8497,That's right.
8499,"Yeah, he was my neighbour. Why?"
8501,Get out of here! What's Andy up to these days?
8504,Sure when he's sober!
8505,Holy camolies! The house I grew up in! It's still there!
8508,Mom! Help!
8510,"Mom, Yancy's trying to steal my clover."
8514,Not yet commander. Yancy's just trying to steal my stuff as usual.
8516,The Ronco Record Vault! Yancy'll never get his hands on you in here or my money back.  Ah The Breakfast Club soundtrack! Man I can't wait til I'm old enough to feel ways about stuff!  Stay safe clover. I may need you again someday.
8517,This was the storage room. My dad spent years turning it into a bomb shelter.
8520,This is it! My Ronco Record Vault! I still remember the combination.  Three. It's stuck.
8522,Here it is. The Breakfast Club soundtrack.
8524,I hid my seven leaf clover in this very record jacket so my brother Yancy wouldn't get it.  Here goes.  It's gone!  the whole place has been cleaned out! Yancy stole my clover! That thief!
8526,Everything else in here held up OK.
8528,I don't know why my brother hated me so much.
8530,You think? 'Cause I always kinda wished that -
8532,It's my brother Yancy! And there in his lapel - my seven leaf clover! I knew he stole it.
8534,Wait a second! That's my name! Good Lord. He ditched his goofy name and stole mine!
8536,"First person on Mars?? I should have been the first person on Mars! He stole my clover, he stole my name and he stole my life!  And now he broke my hand."
8541,That clover helped my ratfink brother steal my dream of going into space. Now I'll never get there.
8544,I'm Philip J. Fry! He stole my name after I got frozen.
8546,That should have been me!
8547,That's my clover! Yancy stole it!
8548,That's what I'm known for!
8550,"So that's where my clover is? Hey, is that orbitting cemetary near here?"
8552,"Good. Leela, Bender, we're going graverobbing."
8561,I should be the one in that grave!
8562,Hmm. We lost Bender.
8564,Aha! My brother's grave!
8566,"It's all lies every word of it! He wasn't original, he wasn't a Martian, he wasn't Philip Fry and since when is he a the?"
8568,It's clovering time!
8573,"(reading) Here lies Philip J. Fry, named for his uncle, to carry on his spirit."
8593,"Aww. That's terrible, Leela. But imagine the look on their faces when you show up with two friends who eat all the hors d'oeuvres."
8596,Eww!
8602,Mmm! The gristle-in-a-blanket isn't half bad.
8605,I don't see you anywhere.
8635,Sure haven't.
8637,(thoughtful) Really?
8645,"Hey, why are those kids following you? Do you have candy stuck to your ass?"
8651,You guys are crazy. Leela doesn't need surgery. You look great the way you are.
8653,"But you're better than normal, you're abnormal. If you ask me, you shouldn't care what other people think."
8661,Bah! I think she looked fine before.
8691,This is so unfair! I liked you back when you were a cyclops! That guy's only interested now that you have two eyes.
8693,"No, I'm not! Oh, wait, I am. But my point remains valid!"
8725,What's so wonderful about Leela being normal? The rest of us aren't normal and that's what makes us great. Like Dr. Zoidberg: He's a weird monster who smells like he eats garbage and does.
8727,"And the professor's a senile, amoral crackpot.  Hermes is a Rastafarian accountant."
8729,Amy's a klutz from Mars.
8732,"I already did! So, Leela, do you wanna be like us? Or do you wanna be like Adlai with no severe mental or social problems whatsoever?"
8764,You are a calculator.
8766,There goes my new kitchen cabinets.
8808,Yay!
8815,It's good to have the old weird-looking Leela back.
8817,"Leela, there's nothing wrong with anything."
8826,(unenthusiastic) Huzzah!
8834,"Oh, no, I'm boned! I haven't paid into the pension either. What'll I do when I retire?"
8836,"Hey, I don't see you planning for your old age."
8838,Well I'm gonna take action. It's time to check on my retirement fund.  Damn! Still only $100.
8840,He's right! I've gotta start investing wisely.
8841,"Well, I'm down to my last lottery ticket. Cherry.  Cherry!  Mule. Crud!"
8844,(shrugging) You gotta spend money to make money.
8866,I sure do! That's the real robber and I'll never forget his name as long as I live. And that name is--
8868,You're right. You're right. It was--
8872,I refuse to testify on the grounds that my organs will be chopped up into a patté.
8884,(from box) Ow! My head! Ow! My feet! Ow! My head! Ow! My feet!
8886,(from box) Ow! My chin!
8887,"I don't belong here, Bender. This is an asylum for insane robots!"
8889,"Oh, good, a physical! Once they examine my fragile, naked, pink body, they'll see I'm not a--"
8890,What the--?
8893,"Look! There's been a terrible mistake. I'm a human being. See?  I'm all squishy and flabby. Also, I complain a lot."
8895,I do other human stuff! I age! See?
8898,The car dealer? Wow! I guess his prices really were insane.
8901,"Actually, we've met once before."
8905,"My roommate exploded. Oh, you gotta help me, Bender. How can I prove I'm human?"
8907,I don't wanna!
8909,You do?
8914,Let me guess: He thinks he's Lincoln?
8921,"Bender, I can't take much more of this! I want outta here!"
8923,But I'm not a robot like you. I don't like having discs crammed into me. Unless they're Oreos - and then only in the mouth! Don't you understand? I'm gonna die here!
8928,You gotta get me out of here. I would have starved to death if not for that sick vending machine robot.  Gimmie! Gimmie!
8931,At least I have friends on the outside. Bender's been no help at all.
8936,"(shouting) Help me! For God's sake, help me!"
8938,"(sleep-talking) Thirty days hath September, April, June and ... wonder ... is that peanut butter ... what am I gonna do? (talking) Oh, God! What? What? What is it now?"
8940,"Finally! Sweet justice! Sweet, juicy justice!"
8947,Roberto! W-W-W-What are you doing here?
8949,Why would you hold up the same bank twice?
8951,"N--, n--, n--"
8953,No! Please! Help! Stop it! Please!
8956,I'm not a robot! (shouting) I'm not a robot!
8962,"(mechanical voice) Affirmative. I feel nothing. I am a robot. Beep, beep, beep ..."
8966,(mechanical voice) Negative. I must be a robot. Why else would human women refuse to date me?
8968,"(mechanical voice) Bio-units, terminate noise exchange. It is time for you to ingest sandwiches from my compartment."
8983,"Oh, you sad, worthless human."
8985,Fear not! For I shall assist ye!
8987,"Relax, mammal. My robotic software shall meet your calculatory needs.  What is the meaning of this symbol?"
8989,I'll show ye!
8990,Stand back. I'm a tool-bot.
8992,"Yes, I am. I simply haven't discovered my primary function yet."
8996,Beep.
8999,"(drunk) Alcohol fuels my power cells. And as a mighty robot, I--  Beep."
9028,"Halt, fellow robot!"
9030,"The side that kicks your twisted, metal ass!"
9032,"Negative, bossy meat creature. I know now what my primary function is: I am a battle-droid. Sworn to protect the weak from crazy robots."
9036,No knife can penetrate my skin-tanium armour.
9045,"(mechanical voice) It was nothing. I-- (normal) Blood? Robots don't have blood. I must be a, a--"
9047,"A human! Oh, my God! I'm a human!"
9050,I'm gonna continue never washing this cheek again.
9052,"Aw. Thanks, Bender."
9058,Oh my God! They dug up a bag of olestra chips from my time!  There must be layers and layers of old stuff down there.
9060,"No, it's an old Volkswagen van.  (shouting) Hey, Mister? Mind if I take this old van?"
9062,"Yeah yeah, I've gotten used cars before."
9064,"It's called a van, and in light of the fact that it's not a-rockin', I invite you to come a-knockin'!"
9068,"No, it can't, but it's got a driver's-side floor and an 8-track player with genuine mono sound."
9070,Under the seat.
9072,It just needs some gas.
9075,Like what?
9078,"Oh, right. Plus, the magnet screws up your inhibition unit and makes you sing folk songs."
9080,"Bender, if you don't open that can right now, your fear will own you, and nothing that can opener could ever do could be worse than that."
9087,"Oh, no!"
9096,"Oh, no, this is terrible."
9099,"Wait a minute, Bender is my best friend. We can't just dump him in the gutter like Grandma's ashes."
9106,"No, why?"
9111,"Aw, you look so sad. You want me to send Patch Cord Adams back in?"
9127,"Hey, I have an idea. Who wants to cram in my van and follow Bender on tour and live there, in the van?"
9133,"Yeah, I like it."
9140,Oh yeah!
9145,"Mine too, even my change."
9166,Surprise!
9169,"Wow, I forgot about TV. Living free on the road, you realise how much better life is without it. Well, let's see what's on."
9172,Yeah!
9178,"Bender, you can move! You're cured!"
9181,"Bender, I don't claim to understand ""the biz"" but wouldn't being able to move help your music career?"
9197,"Brothers and sisters, get your love beads. Can't journey to the centre of your mind without love beads!"
9204,(shouting) Bender rules!
9273,"Hurry, the Golden Gate Bridge. Put the metal to the pedal to the other metal."
9276,Is any of that a problem?
9281,Phew!
9290,"(shouting) C'mon, Bender. If you're done scamming Beck, we're heading home."
9295,"So, Leela, how about a romantic ride in one of those swan boats? They're kinda dangerous but I finally mastered them."
9297,Oh. That explains these boat eggs.
9300,(shouting) What happens if we lose?
9311,"Hey, Leela. Look at me!"
9313,There's a lot about my face you don't know. Perhaps you and it could get better acquainted over dinner.
9315,"C'mon, Leela, why won't you go out with me? We both know there's something there."
9336,What's happening?
9342,"Ooh, ooh, ooh, put me in, professor. I wanna show Leela my skills."
9344,Who cares? We're 35 points ahead with two minutes left. What could possibly -
9358,Is that a problem?
9367,You mean we just -
9382,"Psst, Leela. I've set up a time-proof shelter in the closet. There's only room for two, and you're the one I wanna share it with."
9385,"(sexfully) Because when we're together in here, baby, time will stand still."
9386,Ow.
9415,Hooray for Leela!
9418,"Leela, I want you to know I think the way you moved those stars around was really wonderful. I got you something."
9420,"You deserve it. I mean, nobody ever stops to tell you what a great captain you are."
9422,"You're smart, you're beautiful, and best of all, you'll go out with me-ee?"
9426,"I got her champagne, I opened it. What does a guy have to do?"
9428,Hmm. Maybe this is the moment to show her my real surprise.
9431,Look. I've been studying how to pilot the ship. Impressed?
9433,I learned how to work the gravity pump too. In case we need to move more stars. So are we dating now?
9435,"Look, Leela. I know there's some perfect, amazing thing I can do to make you love me, and when I figure out what it is -"
9444,Of course not.
9446,"No! Drugs are for losers and hypnosis is for losers with big, weird eyebrows. I don't know what amazing thing I did you make you love me but, whatever it was, we're married now. We've got the rest of our lives to work -"
9448,What?
9450,Fine. Break my heart again.
9452,How did I do it? How did I get Leela to love me? I've got to figure it out.
9455,I don't know what I'm doing.
9458,"Oh, it's hopeless. I did something so great that it won Leela's heart and I'll never, ever know what it was. My life is empty."
9493,"Leela, about the wedding. I don't know what I did to make you love me, and I don't think I tricked you into it, but maybe I did. And if I did, I'm sorry."
9495,Yeah. But I don't guess anything I could do will ever make you feel the same way about me that I do about you.
9499,She's so great. I feel like I can almost remember the magical thing I did to make her love me. But I guess I never will.
9501,Oh!  That's how I must have done it! I moved the stars themselves to write her a love note in the sky.
9503,(screaming) Nooo!  Did you see it? Did you see it?
9505,"No, not the explosion!"
9507,(quietly) Nothing.
9516,"I just saw something incredibly cool. A big floating ball that lit up with every colour of the rainbow, plus some new ones that were so beautiful I fell to my knees and cried."
9518,Yeah.
9520,Well I don't care if it was some dork in a costume. For one brief moment I felt the heartbeat of creation. And it was one with my own.
9523,"How can you people be so blase? Here you are in the year 3000 or so, yet you just sit around like its the boring time I came from."
9525,Yeah. But now its the distant future. Why aren't we out doing everything I ever dreamed of?
9529,(sexfully) Everything?
9532,"Yeah, what did they ever do for me?"
9534,I wanna see the edge of the universe!
9537,"Far out! So, there's an infinite number of parallel universes?"
9539,"Oh, well, I'm sure that's enough."
9541,"(shouting) Yeehah! Bow before your master, puny mortals! Whoo! Giddy-up! Ha ha! Woohoo! Whoopie!"
9544,That was fun. Let's give him a treat!
9546,The tongue tickles.
9547,These new hands are great. I'm gonna break them in tonight.
9549,I've only got two fantasies left: Be invisible in a chocolate factory and be romantically linked with a celebrity.
9551,
9553,It is?
9555,Download a celebrity from the internet? What part of that do I understand?
9557,"Hey, I have an idea. Let's do that!"
9563,Ooo! eBay!
9566,So where's the celebrity dating place?
9569,Nah. I read in Newsweek that she drinks human blood.
9571,I'd prefer someone from the era of shaved underarms. Do you have anything with a more Lucy Liu feel to it?
9573,I'd like the 2003 model.
9574,Wahoo! I've found her! What do I do now?
9576,It worked!
9578,(muffled) It worked perfectly!
9581,Did you hear that? She likes me!
9583,But this is Lucy Liu! Perhaps the only good actress of the 21st century! She's more than just a piece of software.
9585,"Uh, not right now."
9587,"So uh, what do you feel like doing?"
9589,I said later!
9590,"Then when I feel so stuffed I can't eat anymore, I just use the restroom, and then I can eat more."
9592,Oh Lucy! You're just like I always thought you'd be from your movies.
9594,You're cute!
9596,You!
9598,You!
9600,You!
9605,"Well, so what if I love a robot? It's not hurting anybody."
9669,This is the best movie I've ever seen. It has a vampire and an explosion!
9676,"Aww, you guys came to watch me make out! That is so sweet.  Wait a minute! Is that the head of who I think it's of?"
9679,Let me see.  Yep. Why do you ask?
9685,"Sorry laides, employees only."
9695,"Lucy Liubot, if I don't survive the corn I want you to know that I love you as much as a man can love a computerised image of gorgeous celebrity. Which it turns out is a lot."
9697,What are you doing darling? Get down!
9698,You saved us. Are you alright?
9703,What?? No!
9705,But I just downloaded her because I love you.
9707,I'm sorry. Hug me Liubot.
9710,Uh huh. And I guess now maybe I can get to know the real Lucy Liu.
9713,"But, but!"
9717,"I've never seen a supernova blow up. But if it's anything like my old Chevy Nova, it'll light up the night sky!"
9719,
9720,"Let's go microwave, I'm in a hurry here! Hm?  Hey, what smells like blue?"
9724,"Hey, which crazy thing happening are you guys screaming about?"
9726,Ooo my popcorn's done!
9727,"Aw, it's less popped than ever."
9733,We're gonna crash!
9736,"Bender, are you OK?"
9746,Yo!
9752,My God! This mean the flying saucer that crashed in Roswell...was...us!
9761,"Hey, and while we're on the base I'll visit my grandfather Enos! He was stationed at Roswell."
9763,Got it.
9765,But existing is basically all I do!
9772,It's him! It's my grandfather Enos.
9774,That jeep's gonna hit him! And I won't exist anymore!  Are you crazy? You almost got yourself run over!
9779,That's it! This place is too dangerous. We've gotta get you out of here!  Everything's gonna be alright Dad!
9792,Thank God I got you off that dangerour army base!
9797,Yowza! I know what I want for dessert!
9799,"Grandma Mildred?! Uh, no dessert, just coffee."
9802,Eh she sure is pretty. You ought to marry her and father some children right away!
9804,What?? Don't ever say or think that again! Please. Just concentrate on staying alive!  Fire! Look out!  Oh! You almost got neutered.
9806,For me it is!  I'm getting you out of here!
9807,"OK, we're in the middle of nowhere, which is the safest part of nowhere. Just stay put and enjoy this calendar."
9808,Safe and sound! Finally I can continue to exist!
9822,"Well, I killed my grandfather."
9825,I dunno. Maybe God loves me.
9827,"Aww. There there. If it makes you feel any better, his body was vapourised so there's no chance of him coming back as a zombie."
9829,Then you're a braver woman than I.
9831,"Uh, how far is it?"
9847,Aww I know how you feel. My grandfather died recently.
9849,"Hey, you know what always cheers you up? Baking me a nice tray of sugar cookies!"
9851,I shouldn't be here. I shouldn't even exist. But I do which proves...you can't really be my grandm -
9854,Relax! She can't be my grandmother! I figured it all out.
9856,"It's impossible! I mean, if she's my grandmother, who's my grandfather?"
9865,But...but won't that change history?
9872,"Take this Mr President, sir!"
9877,Yay!
9880,Turn around. We've gotta go back for Bender!
9886,"Oh, poor Bender. He must be so lonely right now. Trapped a thousand years in the past. Hey! Wait a second!"
9888,No.  Wait!
9890,He's alive!  Bender. What was it like lying in that hole for a thousand years?
9903,Just as well. I'm getting tired of this wood show.
9909,Alright!
9912,These letters are real butt-nutters! Listen to this one: (reading) Dear Santa.
9916,"It's not fair. In my day Xmas was supposed to bring people together, not blow them apart!"
9918,"Certainly yes us! Uh-huh, sir! We've gotta bring back the kind of Xmas I remember."
9923,"Uh, look, we've got mail for Santa. Are you his elves?"
9928,But you live in a gingerbread house.
9934,That's it! I'm gonna deliver a gift of my boot up Santa's chimney. Where is he?
9950,Faster! Faster!
9951,Why aren't we moving?
9954,He's trapped!
9957,And I can deliver them. Billions and billions in one night.
9959,Evil Knievel could!
9970,(singing) Which is good because we don't intend to pay.
9983,"(singing) These toys soldiers are poorly painted,"
10008,Ah! Bathtub eggnog! Just the way Grandma used to drink.  Ew! It went sour!
10042,"Oh, no! The ice is melting!"
10045,And your breezy short-shorts!
10047,Hurry! We've gotta think of another way to save Bender or Xmas will be ruined!
10059,I'm Santa Claus!
10065,"Your Mayorness, if you execute him, you have to execute all of us."
10068,This is horrible.
10076,Don't do it! He's evil!
10087,Wait a second! Maybe your futuristic Xmas isn't so rotten after all.
10089,But don't you see? Fear has brought us together. That's the magic of Xmas!
10107,Kinda gamey.
10125,"Speaking of which, try these nachos."
10156,He's dead.
10163,Ooo I have one. I'm good at video games and bad at everything else. That's why I wish life were more like a video game.
10165,"Uh, What if that thing I said?"
10168,"Wait a second, I know that monkey. His name is Donkey."
10175,"Well sir, I spent all of ninth grade studying them. Except for that day when my eyeballs started to bleed. And in my opinion."
10179,Hey watch out!
10182,"Its OK, I had another guy!"
10186,"Alright, its Saturday night. I have no date, a two litre bottle of Shasta, and my all Rush mix tape! Let's rock!"
10189,I've still got a trick or two up my sleeve. Watch as I fire up through our own shields.
10193,"Amy, tend to the widow pac-man."
10201,What do you monsters want?
10212,I guess so.
10219,Ow!
10236,"OK crow, prepare to be scared.  And then - honk honk - the car honked it's own horn!"
10238,"Hey, that's not a nice thing to say."
10246,"Man, we've been skipping for hours. I need to pull over and take the wiz."
10256,That's great Leela.
10269,Why does everyone keep saying that?
10279,"Leela, are you alright? You got wanged on the head."
10281,"Never mind Professor, she came to."
10321,"Whoa! Letters like ""U"" and ""R"" can mean words like ""You"" and ""Are."" Here Leela, U-R-2 Cute!"
10323,"I've never been able to put into words how I feel about you. But somewhere among these trillions of hearts, those words must already exist. And I'm gonna find them."
10327,And you got a cage for the lion!
10337,"Before we deliver these hearts, I'm gonna find the one that sums up my feelings for you!  ""I Love You."" Hmm, too conventional. ""You're My Man."" Ooo so close!"
10339,Whoa!
10341,Maybe we hit a space cow.
10348,Wow Bender. Are you and the ship an item? I mean I know you're both items but...how can you date a ship anyway? It'd be like me dating a really fat lady. And living inside her. And she'd be all like...
10355,The ship? But you just started dating.
10359,You have much to teach us.
10366,Planet Express Ship? Is that you?
10368,"Uh, um no. I think he's at his parent's."
10370,Bender? No! He's an old fashioned one spaceship robot. Look I'll tell him you stopped by OK?
10406,Incoming torpedoes. Shields at maximum yarnell.
10415,You couldn't have picked a better time to dump the ship Bender!
10423,What's happening? Space cow?
10433,Ha! That barely hurt Leela at all!
10437,"Same as everyday, got it."
10450,I'm on it. And maybe I'll find those magic words while I'm at it.
10452,Eh.  Blech!  Eurgh! Ooo how 'bout this one?
10457,"Um, Leela?"
10464,Bender! Are you OK?
10468,Well I guess we'd better clean up these millions of hearts.
10473,Sure. We talk about it all the time.
10475,No. Burn!
10489,What does it taste like?
10516,"If those aren't tears of happiness, please stop crying."
10518,"Is it this room that's making you sad? It's probably the room. Come on, lets go for a walk."
10520,"Yeah, I do that with my stupidness."
10522,"Then today's your lucky day because I happen to be a holding, stroking, lovin' machine! Also spankin'!"
10524,"Well, anyway, just remember that people care about you."
10526,"Yo yo, Bezender! What up?"
10538,No fair!
10541,It's like that time I peeked in the kitchen at Imperial Hunan.
10550,What happened?
10559,That's when we saved Earth from a giant asteroid of garbage.
10563,(whispering) Dude! Over here!
10565,And also - for some reason - the letter I wrote you full of my personal feelings.
10570,"Leela, freak out later. We're not done escaping yet!"
10573,Ow!
10580,"(whispering) Shut up, you two! We can kill ourselves when we get home!"
10587,Come on Leela. You can do it!
10589,Whoa! What are you doing?
10596,Leela's going nuts and I can't save her unless I learn more about her mysterious past. Isn't there anything else you can tell me?
10598,That's impossible because my time is worthless!
10600,Hand it over.
10602,"Look, I'm trying to save someone here. I'll have to come back for those later."
10603,Can you translate it?
10605,I didn't ask for a completely reasonable excuse. I asked you to get busy.
10607,Isn't that the same machine that makes noses?
10609,Is it done?
10642,Stop!  Thanks Bender! Don't do it Leela!
10644,Close.
10647,I had the Professor analyse the alienese letter that was found with you.
10649,I 'unno. But the analysis showed it was printed on recycled toilet paper. A squeezably soft paper used mainly in the sewers.
10687,"So what's Mars Day about, anyway?"
10693,"Lighten up, Leela. It's funny!"
10708,I'll have a thorax and some feelers.
10710,Yuck!
10726,What's that weird sound?
10751,"Aw, man!"
10762,Yee-haw!
10764,Where?
10766,Oh. Oh!
10768,Where?
10770,"Pfft, that's not scary!"
10773,Hook on the hand!
10775,Man in the attic!
10777,"With pleasure. (spookily) Once, not far from here, four people set out on a cattle drive--"
10779,"And then, while they sat helplessly around the campfire ... a demented knife-wielding escaped lunatic libertarian zombie mutant snuck up and--"
10803,"Hey, it's that ""barbecue's over"" sound again."
10805,Where?
10807,My God!
10810,"Also, I didn't know buggalo could fly."
10839,Hm.
10876,Yeah!
10883,Wait. That's the bead you traded your land for?
10919,Hey! Now what am I supposed to watch and drink all day?
10921,Well there's the material rewards.
10939,Happy funeral Bender!
10941,We just wanted to show you that you really will be remembered.
10943,"Dearly beloved, we are here today to remember Bender, taken from us in the prime of life, when he was crushed by a runaway semi, driven by the Incredible Hulk."
10945,Now let us each remember the best things about Bender in our own way. Professor?
10968,"Yes there is Bender. Bender was a lot of things to a lot of people, but looking back, the number one thing I can say about him is this, and simply this: Bender was my friend."
10973,I thought something looked different in here.
10974,"Hi, we have a giant stone to deliver - sign here."
10980,"Call it a hunch but, I've got a bad feeling about this."
10981,You know the worst thing about being a slave? They make you work but they don't pay you or let you go.
10984,Incredible. This place is just like the Ancient Egypt of my day.
10986,I knew it! Insane theories: one! Regular theories: a billion!
10988,Also Wolfman!
11001,"Yeah, remember who your real friends are."
11025,Can you believe it? Pharaoh's dead!
11028,I'm gonna spin til I fall down!
11036,You know what else stinks about being a slave? The hours.
11039,"Hey, I think I know who the next Pharaoh is!"
11068,"Bender, I really hope that's you. 'Cause if it isn't......we're in trouble!"
11075,What proof is this? Some huge number?
11079,Bend-er? Doesn't ring a bell.  Did you hear something Leela?
11082,Hey Leela you know who I remember...?
11084,...That guy who used to bend things. You know...?
11086,...Hermes.
11096,Absolutely.
11104,Space pirates?
11109,"Come on, come on."
11112,Firing torpedo number three!
11118,Go after him Leela!
11120,You mean we can never catch up to him? Not even if we rub the engine with cheetah blood?
11122,(solemn) He always wanted to drift forever. But through the American Southwest.
11142,Can you find him Professor?
11148,No that's I don't -
11150,"Well, I guess that sounds OK."
11152,What? Really?
11172,"He decided not to let go.  I can't believe you're gone. I won't! If I can't reach you physically, I'll just have to try something desperately crazy!"
11173,So that's my story Father Changstein el Gamahl. Is there anything religion can do to help me find my friend?
11175,Uh-huh but is there anything useful we can do?
11178,Bonder? Is it really you?
11180,"Wait a minute. Bender's name isn't Bonder, it's Bender. You're a fraud!"
11182,Only if you don't have any real hope.
11184,I've not heard of them.
11186,You think they'd let me use it to look for Bender?
11196,"Sir, I'm outfitting an expedition to a monestary high in the Himalayas. I'll need a long sleeved coat."
11198,"You can't give up hope just because it's hopeless. You gotta hope even more and cover your ears and go ""blah blah blah blah blah blah blah!""  (shouting) I'd also like a pack mule."
11212,
11229,And then what?
11234,"Hmm, finding God, that - that's important, yeah. But you know what might be a treat for everyone? If you let me use the telescope to find my lost friend Bender."
11236,"Aw c'mon, you guys have forever to look for God. All I'm asking is one measley lifetime to find my friend."
11239,That telescope is as much mine as it is anybody's. I'm using it whether you give me permission or not.
11261,Bender? Bender?
11262,Hello? Has anyone out there seen Bender?
11265,"(sadly) You're right. I'm never gonna see him again. I know he was evil and on more than one occasion he, he actually stole my blood.  But still, I wish I had Bender back."
11270,Bender! It's a miracle!  Ow!
11273,We climbed a mountain and locked up some monks.
11275,Do we have to? I mean they're monks. I'm sure their God will let them out or at least give them more shoes to eat.
11289,"Ooo, a bot-mitzvah. Shalom hunger, shalom free food!"
11293,So what's the deal? You guys don't believe in Robot Jesus?
11304,This is perfect for me.
11310,Boneitis? Pft! That's a funny name for a horrible disease.
11314,Y'know that dance wasn't as safe as they said it was.
11316,No question.
11318,"They're scared of our raw power. Oh but if you want a job, I could beg everyone at the company where I work."
11336,I nominate That Guy. Not just because he has a suit but because he knows about business and stuff and he has a tie. My shares still count if they went through the washing machine right?
11356,I'm rollin' up the corporate ramp.
11363,No thanks I make my own.
11372,"No we're not. And as vice chairman, I believe I speak for the entire board when I issue this challenge to Mom. Look at my butt!"
11376,Woo yeah! Hit him hit him hit him! Now this is the high life! Watching apes mangle each other near celebrities!
11380,"Uh, work really really hard?"
11382,Oh thank God!
11384,This company's on the fast track to the It List! Blast back kudos all around!
11392,Yes I did Leels! And I'll tell you why. Because it grows the brand.
11401,"Tonight, that's us!"
11405,Make it two. And a glass of all your water.
11407,"Don't you worry about ""blank"" let me worry about ""blank."""
11412,I'm on it. But if you need me you know where I'll be.
11414,Don't you worry about Planet Express. Let me worry about blank!
11417,What? I haven't changed.  Suz? Have I changed?
11419,Thanks doll.
11422,"You're right Professor. We might not be a traditional family like the Murphy's next door or the lesbian coven across the street but we are a family, and That Guy understands that."
11428,Uh Ms Johnson? Please bring in some more chair fuel.
11429,I had no idea the company would be sold. I was just an innocent suck up. You've gotta believe me!
11435,"Ms Johnson, you've never lied to me. Am I still a good person?"
11437,"I've got to redeem myself. Somehow, sometime, for some reason. I'll block this takeover!"
11439,"Believe it or not, I have more important things to do today than laugh and clap my hands.  Reschedule."
11476,"...So I ask you, as a friend, won't you stop this deal?"
11478,Oh my God! His boneitis!
11480,He's dead.
11482,I don't think so. 'Cause as vice chairman of the company I gain voting control of his shares.
11484,I'll be whatever I wanna do! That Guy was the greatest businessman that ever lived and before his mysterious death he taught me everything he knew.  But some things I had to learn myself. I learned that money is fine but in the end what counts is people... ...People you love... ...You can't put a price on that... So I'm giving up control of the company... ...to a man of enourmous experience... ...Professor... ...Hubert Farnsworth.
11489,You mean you'd rather be rich than work together?
11491,In my whole life this company was the only place I ever really felt at home. If being millionaires is more important to you than our...
11493,"...friendship, then I'll sell Planet Express, for you."
11497,It is? Yahoo! We're poor no matter what I do! The deal is off!
11499,"Look, so we're not millionaires. At least we all still get to work together!"
11505,"I know, and I've grown to accept that. Now I'm more interested in that new pizza parlour across the street. Kinda makes me pine for my days as a pizza delivery boy. ""Here's you pizza,"" I'd say. ""I didn't order any,"" they'd say. And then I'd be off to my next adventure."
11514,"Uh, hmm, do you have any food?"
11519,"Hey hey, what's wrong? Was it something Leela said?"
11521,"Aww, don't cry foreign people. I used to work in a pizzeria and as soon as I stop hallucinating and blasting puke, I'm gonna teach you to sell pizza - Earth style!"
11524,"For starters, only use quality ingredients. Case in point: No more live bees.  Oregano works equally well. And when you put pizzas in the oven, don't get in with them."
11526,"Most important of all is the big screen TV. Human families need a TV when they're eating so they don't have to talk to each other.  Ah, the Earthican pasttime, blernsball!"
11529,Well if you're going to be Earthicans we'll have to teach you. How about your pizzeria plays a game against Planet Express? Oh but you'll need nine players.
11546,"Leela, you beaned a run-in. You'd better let me pitch."
11564,"Wow, I must say I'm impressed. You look just like a ball player. Can I pat you on the butt?"
11566,"Ohh, now I'm too nervous."
11572,(shouting) Go Leela!
11620,Hey look! The player's who broke the various colour barriers!
11624,And here he is trying to make a catch with an oven mit.
11627,Hank Aaron XXIV? How could you play so blowfully? The original Hank Aaron was great!
11633,Leela could beat that. She's pitched her whole career without getting an out.
11644,"(whispering) Psst, you're holding the bat upside down."
11648,Hooray!
11653,Hey! You opened a franchise!
11678,(shouting) Strike him out Leela! Do it for the hundreds of women everywhere!
11702,"Hey, uh, what's with all the pots and pans? You building a wife?"
11704,Brunch. Right. I'd better warn - tell - warntell the others!
11711,Brace yourselves. Bender is making us brunch.
11714,He's so proud of his awful cooking. If we don't eat it he'll be crushed.
11716,Hurry!
11720,"Uh, with you blocking the only escape route? Don't be silly!"
11736,...but this food actually tastes better as vomit!
11748,What up?
11749,(singing) I'm walking on sunshine! La la la la sunshine!
11788,What?!
11791,"Well, I don't remember any of that but I don't have the wherewithal to defend myself."
11793,There you go.
11820,(shouting) Yeah you show 'em!
11841,"Yo, hook me up. My turkey is dry and I've tried everything.  Oh right. Never mind."
11858,Yay!
11872,"Ah, so the real gift Spargle gave you was confidence. The confidence to be your best."
11890,You know what movies average out to be really good? The first six Star Trek movies!
11893,What words? Star Trek?
11911,"She's all yours, buddy!"
11914,"Mr. Nimoy, I came as soon as I heard what happened centuries ago. I can't believe your show was banned."
11916,"You know? 1966? 79 episodes, about 30 good ones."
11918,Come on! Remember that episode where you go high on spores and smacked Kirk around?
11920,Aha! You can't escape it!
11922,"Uh, jeez, don't get upset. I mean, OK I outwitted you, but--"
11928,I'm literally angry with rage! Your co-stars may be gone but we can still get those episode tapes back for the whole world to see. Come on!
11932,But we have to! The world needs Star Trek to give people hope for the future.
11935,"'Cause it-it taught me so much. Like how you should accept people, whether they be black, white, Klingon or even female. But most importantly, when I didn't have any friends, it made me feel like maybe I did."
11942,"Oh, dip!"
11944,It's all stuff from that forbidden show.
11954,Welshy?
11957,I can't believe it! How'd you all end up here?
11960,Say it in Russian!
11962,"Now say ""nuclear wessels""!"
11973,(screaming) Welshy!
11978,"Alright, you gas, what's the deal?"
11980,Tremble? I laugh. Nobody knows more about Star Trek than me!
11982,Cool! A Star Trek convention!
12001,Uh ... Khan?
12004,You have my fan script?
12006,"(smug) Oh, I was confused because the scoreboard says something different."
12012,Not 'til I get my 600 quatloos!
12013,This is wrong. We shouldn't have abandoned them there.
12016,"Well, usually on the show someone would come up with a complicated plan then explain it with a simple analogy."
12019,Of course! It's so simple!
12031,Like a balloon and ... something bad happens.
12042,"Great list. Except, you forgot episode 66!"
12054,And we can tie these caterpillars together to make bow strings for bows and arrows.
12061,"Well, here goes nothing."
12072,It hurts!
12082,"All this time we thought he was a powerful super-being, yet he was just a child."
12085,"Bender, wait! This is our chance to escape, before Melllvar comes back. But we all need to work together."
12088,We've decided to work together.
12095,"Stop! You're just goin' around in circles! (to himself) Think, Fry, think! Everyone's depending on you."
12097,"Look, Leonard, we're light enough to keep the tapes! Isn't that great?"
12099,We did it!
12100,Melllvar's got a spaceship!
12110,"Wait! If they mean that much to you, why do you wanna kill them?"
12112,"Melllvar, you can't let a TV show be your whole life. You can do anything you want. Look at Walter Koenig: After Star Trek, he became an actor."
12115,"Whoa, whoa! One step at a time."
12117,"Episode 10, Balance Of Terror."
12124,And all you had to put up with was one really annoying Star Trek fan.
12130,Man it's hot! (different voice.) How hot is it? (normal voice.) It's so hot I poured McDonalds Coffee in my lap to cool off.  Jonny Carson said it.
12148,Wait! Where do we get the ice?
12150,"Wow! Mining a comet, that sounds fun!"
12153,"Wow! That ice dispenser's so big, the ice crushes you!  Yakov Smirnov said it!"
12156,Oh my God! It's out of ice! Like some outer space Motel 6!
12166,Bender? Are you crying?
12178,What? I've seen you get up off your back tons of times.
12194,Good for him!
12205,"Professor, you're a Professor. You must have some ideas."
12211,"Professor no, don't do it!"
12225,That's awful Professor. Especially the making out part.
12237,Be brave my friend.
12239,Ah ha!
12248,Wait. We could hide you! We'll pile fruit on you and claim you're a bowl.
12250,I won't let you.
12252,"Bender, this world isn't good enough for you."
12277,Why isn't this working?!
12292,"Amazing! That's why they call you ""Bender The Magnificent""!"
12294,"Whoa! They discovered an intact, 20th Century pizzeria! Just like the one I used to work at!"
12296,Lets go check it out. You can see how I lived before I met you.
12298,Sure. Lots of people did.
12302,"Wait a second! This is Panucci's! I used to work in this exact pizzeria! And for your information lady, this was not just used to paddle my butt, it was also used to move pizzas and crush rats."
12304,"Don't wave your fancy degrees at me. I recognise all this stuff.  Petrified sausages, Old Mr Patelli, and that's -"
12306,Pizza delivery for Mr......Seymour Asses.
12308,I wouldn't count on it.
12309,"Aww. Poor little guy. You look like you haven't eaten in a month. Here......but if Mr Panucci asks, your name is Seynour Asses!  I like you Seymour, you're not constantly judging me like all the other dogs - are you? Nah. We understand each other.  People think you're a dumb mutt who smells bad, can't find a girlfriend and has a crummy job. But you're keepin' it real and call no man ""Mister.""  Well goodbye.  Live long and prosper."
12311,No! That's my dog in there! It's an outrage I say!
12313,I'm taking him home and I'd like to see anyone try and stop me.  Uh-oh!
12314,"Ow, oo ow, oo ah!"
12316,Well it's not right to make my dead pet an exhibit. That's like digging up Lassie and putting her on display in the Louvre.
12318,"I know, I was deliberately describing a similar situation."
12321,You're right.  I'll give it a shot!
12328,"Seymour, cleanup!  Good dog!"
12332,He's so cute! He can do two things at one time: Eat and swim. Ooo - three things.
12335,So do I get Seymour back? Are you caving to political pressure?
12337,"His name was Seymour. He was once intimate with the leg of a wandering saxaphonist. He had wet dog smell, even when dry. And he was not above chasing the number 29 bus."
12342,Seymour!
12347,Good news everyone!
12350,Which means...we can clone it! Seymour will live again!
12352,Can you believe it Bender? I'm going to have my best friend back!
12355,So will Seymour remember how to sing Walking On Sunshine?
12357,"I'm gonna get my puppy back! In your face, Grim Reaper!"
12364,But I'm celebrating New Years Eve.
12366,I won't be gone long Seymour. Just wait here 'til I come back.
12367,Hello? Pizza delivery for......Icy Wiener?! Aw crud! I always thought at this point in my life I'd be the one making the crank calls!  Here's to another lousy Millenium.  What the?
12369,That's for Seymour.
12371,Oh that's also for Seymour. I'm getting everything ready for when he's cloned.
12373,Hey he was smart. He could fetch.
12375,He could dig up bones.
12377,"Look Bender, this has nothing to do with you."
12379,Now if you'll excuse me I'm working on Seymour's doghouse.
12390,Are you two gonna be done soon?
12392,Well could you do it some place else? I'm setting up Seymour's doggy bed.
12402,"Ah there, perfect!"
12406,Finally!
12409,Come on boy! Come back to life!
12411,What? I'm in the middle of something.
12413,"Bender, enough! Leave me alone!"
12418,I hate you! I hate you! You evil metal man!  Ow!
12421,May yet? Really?
12423,So Seymour might still exist?
12425,Then I'm goin' in after him.
12428,He'd come after me.
12430,Then all hope is lost.  Goodbye Seymour.
12448,This is all my fault. I let my best friend risk his life just to get my dead dog back.  Bender!!
12451,Yeah!
12453,15? You mean he lived for 12 more years after I got frozen?
12455,Stop the cloning.
12458,Think about it. Seymour lived a full life after I was gone. He probably added new songs to his repertoire.
12460,I had Seymour 'til he was three. That's when I knew him and that's when I loved him.  I'll never forget him. But he forgot me a long long time ago.
12464,How 'bout Löbrau? It has dots on it.
12466,I can't drink that! The metal shavings make my throat bloody.
12497,No I'm...doesn't.
12522,The address was on Dogdoo 8 but the universe ends right after Dogdoo 7!
12550,"No, you have a healthy glow."
12554,I hope it's a lager so I can take it to a ball game.  Ooo! I felt that one!
12588,We don't work for you anymore!
12592,Yes sir!
12610,There. One million papers. Folded and loaded!
12617,"Hurry Leela, get some coasters and cold mugs."
12618,Push Bender push!
12621,Almost there. Just two more bottles.
12623,"It's an ale! 5 gallons, 6 ounces!"
12626,Hey wait a second. How did you deliver a million papers in one hour?
12682,"There's no denying it: The future's crazy! Oh, well. Don't wanna stand out."
12686,"So, what is Freedom Day? Sounds like some kind of feminine hygiene product."
12693,Wow! Nude hot-tubbing? That's all I need to hear about Freedom Day!
12699,(shouting) We're not listening!
12718,Anyone who laughs is a Communist!
12740,They sure hate Dr. Zoidberg.
12742,Where are we ever going to find a lawyer to take his case?
12746,"Who are you, old man?"
12748,I'll never remember that.
12754,"Wait, you're a lawyer? You're hired!"
12755,"You OK there in the embassy, Zoidberg?"
12804,Ow!
12807,I'm no good at being a slave. I'm thinking about graduate school. Y'know? To become a barber?
12813,"Hey, wait! I'm having one of those things. You know? A headache with pictures?"
12815,"Back in my day, we didn't have your fancy all-digital weapons but we still managed to kill each other just fine."
12817,Not big enough. We need something that can take out an entire army. Something you could commit a war crime with--
12830,"You haven't won yet, Moivin! You didn't expect us to even go to a museum, much less steal this ancient heat-seeking missile."
12836,"Zoidberg, how could you? I used to think you were cool."
12906,Over here!
12923,Dude hold up! Remember when Zapp blew a hole in the ship?
12925,Kif touched everybody there. Couldn't any one of us be the mother?
12951,Check it out y'all. Everyone we invited is here.
12953,So lets open the gifts!
12987,Hi!
13015,Congratulations!
13019,That's birth for you.
13041,"Let's see what tools we'll need.  Uh-huh, Uh-huh,  Uh-huh! Alright, we're all set."
13044,Those Swedes sure know how to put in almost everything you need.
13046,I feel like I was mauled by Jesus.
13052,There's no bus to Jersey City.
13055,"I'm too scared to find my pocket. Here, I'll just take of my pants and give you those."
13061,Maybe we're all wearing magic rings but they're invisible rings so we don't even realise it. Also you can't feel the rings.
13063,Wow! A superpowers drug you can just rub into your skin? You'd think it'd be something you have to freebase.
13065,Yup.
13067,Check.
13071,Nope!
13073,"Leela, I think you're missing the big picture. When you were a kid what was your biggest fantasy?"
13075,Whatever. The correct answer is: To be a superhero. We have superpowers and we're Americans. This is our chance.
13077,You'll barely regret this!
13080,Now me and Leela are forming an awesome crime-fighting duo.
13083,"Plus the cream won't give you superpowers, you're a robot."
13087,Captain Yesterday!
13090,Wow!
13096,Sure. I'm listed in the phone book so once I reveal my real name to you along with my home address and a copy of my birth certificate -
13098,From everybody?
13100,Give several reasons why.
13102,Or do we...? No I guess not.
13114,And I can't take life anymore.
13116,Who's the perp?
13118,Pack of highly. Got it!
13123,"Uh, Leela, how you gonna meet your folks tomorrow? We've already scheduled the Zookeeper for a 9am foiling at the museum."
13150,Yet the Zookeeper escaped. Thus proving that the deadliest animal of all is the Zookeeper!
13181,"Leela, is the person that parrot is mimicking telling the truth by proxy?"
13192,"But, should superheroes commit crime? Even to save lives? I need moral guidance. Bender?"
13194,Oh no! Our superpower cream is out of itself!
13196,El zilcho! I'm afraid we're boned.
13199,"Man, this costume is so damn heavy!"
13201,Owww! That...didn't hurt.
13209,So this is your lair?
13211,"OK, take it easy!"
13214,That seemed unnecessary.
13222,Oh yeah!
13228,"I guess, as long as you think it's right."
13237,"My God, he's gonna do it! Everybody, seatbelts to maximum buckling."
13244,"Uh, aren't we looking for your gargoyle?"
13254,Ow! It bit me!
13259,Yup.
13278,He still sounds sorta old. Sorta real old.
13283,This is great Professor! We should go out and celebrate!
13294,But your parents are gross sewer mutants.
13318,"Oh, hello sir. It's a lovely evening you have tonight. Um I'm here to pick up your daughter."
13320,Thanks. These aren't pockets they're just flaps. I put my money in my sock.
13322,A movie.  A movie ma'am.
13327,I'd like a sewer burger but without the rat feces.
13338,"We missed the turn, we'll never catch them."
13340,Yeah!
13342,"Leela you can stop winning now, we won!"
13345,"And then, and then, this giant tapeworm tried to play us for chumps but we like totally dissed Moose!"
13347,Yay!
13353,C'mon! Lets go tell Leela so we can grow up together!
13360,I'll miss you Leela. I'll come ack and visit when I'm all grown up.
13378,I wanna hear a space story!
13382,"Professy's back!  Eww, you smell like smoking.  And drinking."
13410,We did it! We're the right ages again!
13416,I'm sorry you had to give up being a kid Leela.
13418,The fabulous person!
13420,Fabulous friends!
13425,Delivery boy Philip J. Fry reporting for duty.
13427,"What is the meaning of this? We've got a delivery people, let's move, let's move!  Amy? Mission profile?  Interesting, interesting. Dr Zoidberg, mission bag?"
13429,What's this? This is the same toy surprise I got last time!  I can't work under these conditions. And without me there is no mission. I am the mission!
13431,Wh-what? You went without me?
13433,"But, but I'm the delivery boy."
13438,I'm real sorry I missed the mission. I wasn't there and you might have needed me.
13440,But if I'd been there I -
13442,
13444,Bender's great.
13446,"Listen Leela, let me make it up by taking you out to dinner tonight."
13448,Chaz?
13452,"So? I'm just as important as him.  It's just that, the kind of importance I have, it doesn't matter if I...don't do it."
13453,I'm nobody. There are guys in the background with Mary Worth comics who are more important than me.
13455,"Um, OK. Let's go bowling."
13465,"Oh jeez, better not let Leela see me."
13467,You are? So things aren't working out with whatshisname?
13469,Um..uh...
13471,"Oh no, please, no!  Perfect!"
13474,"Wait, I'm trying. It weighs as much as a thousand suns!"
13477,I'm as worthless as this trashcan.
13479,"Oh Nibbler, at least I'm important to you. Even if it's only 'cause I clean up you poop."
13481,D-d-did you just talk?
13483,Like what?
13484,Are you my mommy?
13488,Eh?
13490,"Aww, aren't you a fuzzy wittle guy?"
13492,Mightiness? Are you off your nut? I just got kidnapped by a bunch of guineapigs.
13499,Oh snap!
13503,Maybe later.
13506,"Hmm, I remember the square dancing stomachs, although that might have been a milanta commerical. Wait! The brains! I do remember! But no one else does. They said I was crazy."
13508,Because I'm so smart?
13510,I did do the nasty in the pasty!
13512,So I really am important? How I feel when I'm drunk is correct?
13515,What's so evil about that?
13517,So they're trying to learn things?
13519,Those bastards!
13521,I'm as mad as I've ever been.
13523,Now it's personal.
13526,"OK, let's go through this once more -"
13527,Aah! Brains!
13529,"Sorry, what? I wasn't paying attention."
13531,Who?
13535,I'm at the input console. I'm a little nervous and I've got brain in my buttcrack.
13538,"Hey wait, this brain knows everything about everything right?"
13540,"Yeah yeah, but I can't pass up a chance to learn the answers to the greatest questions of all time.  Is it true that post-it stamp glue is made up of -"
13543,Wait wait wait.  What really killed the dinosaurs?
13546,Uh oh.
13548,Eww gross. Cut it out!
13553,You got it poindexter!
13558,Well at least I did one important thing with my life. Leading good to victory over evil!
13561,The day I got frozen? What about it?
13563,Eh forget it then.
13565,"OK sheesh!  What happened to me, Philip J. Fry, on the night of December 31st 1999?"
13569,"Eurgh! I can't believe how fat I look! Aw, Nibbler's there. Wait! What?!"
13571,"I, I don't understand. You made me go in the freezer tube?"
13573,You little runts froze me! You took away my life!
13575,No you can't. Shut your adorable trap!
13581,Go ahead. I deserve it. I wish those stupid racoons had never brought me to the future.
13585,Really? I can go back in time?
13588,That is interesting. Why?
13590,Everybody wins!
13609,I hope your calculations are correct.
13641,"Whoa, thanks! If you ever need a saviour again, just ask."
13643,"Man, I can't wait to tell everyone what happened."
13645,Huh. Did everything just taste purple for a second? Oh well. Let's go home you dumb poop machine.
13648,Hey Leela. I guess I got this for you.
13650,Then I am the most important person in the universe.
13656,Hooray!
13660,Woohoo!
13670,Larger than an American sedan?  How big is the honey comb?
13675,But Leela we're no good!
13677,I'm not scared of that at all!
13679,"Like my parents. Oh wait, that was hitting!"
13685,Leela let's turn back. There's absolutely no shame in wussing out.
13687,Oh my God! The old Planet Express ship!
13694,Hey what's this goop?
13696,Bees make honey and jelly? Huh. How come nothing humans make taste good? Help! I can't swim in jelly as far as I know!
13698,Leela! Stop bonding and lets go! I got jelly in my underpants!
13706,We made it! We're alive!
13708,Leela we got lucky this time but you should be more careful. I don't want anything to happen to you.
13710,Look out!  You want her you'll have to go through me.
13728,Leela?
13730,"Nope, I'm better than ever. Before the accident I couldn't do this!"
13732,Then I'll prove I'm alive! By telling you something only I could know. There's a surprise for you in my locker. I got it at a Swedish novelty shop before we left.
13734,Sure. There's just one thing I want you to.
13736,I want you to wake up.
13762,"Hi Leela! I'm just gonna keep talking, even if you can't hear me. Blah blah blah, blah blah blah blah blah."
13764,Oh yeah?  Could a dream take you dancing in an illusion garden?
13766,Then what if we shared a sleigh ride across the ice fields of Hiperia?
13768,"Here, take my jacket. You look a little cold."
13770,You can. All you have to do is wake up.
13791,Why and I sticky and naked? Did I miss something fun?
13795,Neat!
13799,Me too.
13801,"Uh, not everything."
13803,You have to wake up.
13843,Leela! You're awake!
13845,In the hospital. The ambulance brought you here right after the bee stung you.
13847,Stinger went right through me and you got all the poison. My new spleen came from a guy who liked to motorcycle.
13854,"I though that if you heard a familiar voice, it might help keep your mind together. But, who knows if it really got through."
13863,"So, will you go out with me?"
13873,Whatever's in there it's the only thing I've ever wanted.
13878,Let's just forget about the box. The Professor said to stay away.
13880,No.
13884,Tangled up Christmas lights! We can take shifts untangling them!
13909,Oh wow. It's like that drug trip I saw in that movie when I was on that drug trip.
13923,"We called it first. Besides, this place kinda feels like a ""B"" y'know?"
13959,You mean you flipped the coin too? And it was tails? So that's why you said you had to meet that ghost.
13963,One year later I got beat up at a Neil Diamond concert by a guy named Scrunchy!
14015,"Yo, did two shellfish in scrubs go by?"
14039,"There but for the flip of a coin go we. So uh Leela, seeing how the universe wasn't destroyed, you wanna catch an ape fight? Y'know? Together?"
14041,So? Heads or tails?
14064,"That's it! I'm getting a hundred cups of coffee! Starting now.  Coffee machine, one cup of coffee please."
14108,"Uh, I'll have a coffee."
14110,Whale please.
14128,Yeah yeah yeah keep it comin' put the pot down get away!
14145,Of course I've been up all night! Not because of caffine it was insomnia I couldn't stop thinking about coffee I need a nap.  Coffee time!
14147,Fancy cigar why don't you smoke it already? Puff puff go go go go go!
14210,Coffee coffee coffee coffee coffee coffee coffee coffee coffee coffee!
14232,Shh! What was that sound?
14234,I meant the sound Bigfoot just made. He's been sighted a lot in this area recently. Just last week a blind hiker felt him!
14236,"Of course I do! Bigfoot's my hero. Growing up, he was the celebrity I most identified with."
14238,'Cause he was a loner who hated the popular monsters yet longed to be one.
14245,I get it!
14247,That proves it!
14260,"Sir, if I may, why don't you set up like a billion video cameras in the woods and see if he walks by one."
14269,You doin' alright out there buddy?
14272,Bigfoot? Bigfoot?
14273,"Bigfoot? Is that you? I'm not like the others Bigfoot. I see through your monster coatings to the gentle loner inside. I bet you have a wounded racoon friend that you tenderly nurse back to health and go......and in the end they shoot you. But you teach us about things. Oh, it's a flying saucer. (shouting) Excuse me? You can't park here. The parking area's over there.  Wow nice tube!  Hey. Hey what's the big idea? Stop abducting me. Why does your vanity plate say ""Probe 1""?"
14278,"Amy, you won't believe what happened......it was so scary that you wouldn't -  I know but listen it gets even scarier."
14280,That's what I'm trying to tell you. See -  Why are you all staring at me like that? Is there something on my face?
14283,Tell me what?
14286,What?
14289,"In the woods, I was walking. For Bigfoot, looking and then aliens beamed me up."
14292,I'm a pathetic freak. My life is ruined.
14294,I'll never have another moment of happiness.
14299,Like me!
14302,My nose is an aphrodisiac?  I'm gonna drop a barf!
14304,Blech! We have to track down my nose before some alien snarfs it and does the worm. Who's in?
14308,"It's no use. We've been to ever scuzzy bazaar in the galaxy, including Pottery Barn."
14311,"Uh, I'm looking for human horn."
14317,"Nope, uh-uh, eww!  Now look, this is the nose we want. Did you sell it to somebody?"
14327,Oh great space king. I humbly beg you to return my human horn.
14333,(sadly) Alright. I give up. I guess I'll just go home and marry a skunk.
14335,My nose! Light of my face!
14338,Hey! You burned my cheek!
14340,"No I mean the singed flesh, I can smell it!  Those lilacs on the table."
14344,"Well, great seeing you, I guess we'll be on our -"
14349,"Hey, what've you heard?"
14351,"OK, you can have my nose."
14358,Wait! I'm usually the first guy to toot my own lower horn -
14360,But in this case I just don't think it'll do any good.
14363,However huge it might be.
14372,Wh-What if we helped you get your passion back without the hassle of mutilating me?
14376,Then it's a deal. We get one night. I keep my horn as long as you two end up doing the horizontal monster mash.
14382,"So, what can I get you this evening?"
14384,"I'll just start you off with some bread. Some sexy, arousing bread!"
14390,"So uh, how are you two sneaky poopums doing?"
14399,"Come on freedom cage! Roll me to safety! Yes! I never thought I'd escape with my doodle, but I pulled it out!"
14402,Bigfoot! He's real! I knew it. The Loch Ness Monster's book was right!
14412,Yeah!
14426,So who should I root for? America or one of those countries I learned about at the Food Court?
14437,"But have they seen your...y'know...physique, since the old days?"
14480,I can't watch this 'cause it's creepy and wrong and sick. However I will watch out of curiosity.
14491,But you're not really a lady anyway. Right?
14512,You gotta tell me. You're not actually attracted to Calculon right? And if you are don't tell me. Are you?
14519,"But what if he wants to, I mean if he tries to...uh...Barry White?"
14539,I'll miss you buddy. You've been like a brother and then a sister to me. And now you're getting married. I love you.
14541,Cool. What's for dinner?
14544,That's marriage alright!
14567,So now you do wanna marry him?
14569,Eck!
14575,Yep.
14592,Yes. And I have a message for you from Colonel Mitumba! He says this......is from Congo Jack.
14603,"Well Bender, I hope this has taught you a lesson about changing your sex to win five gold medals."
14608,Yay my buddy's home! And his respect for women is back to normal.
14614,Eww!
14617,C'mon Bender let's go. This chick flick is getting me all barfy.
14626,Aw man!
14630,And there's a robot scratching post. You should try it out Bender.
14640,(shouting) I get it!
14642,"(shouting) Oh, now I get it!"
14691,"Oh yeah, no, you're pretty perfect."
14780,Hey where's Bender?
14806,"Nah, I had it coming."
14831,This show's been going downhill since season three.
14851,"Look, there's Macaulay Culckon."
14853,Psst. There's that robot child actor who grew up an robbed a convenience store!
14934,Pft. What kind of bozos would start a Bender protest group?
14942,Yeah. Give a little credit to our public schools.
14954,Hey Bender.  Hey Bender.  Hey Bender. Hey Bender.
15015,Hear hear!
15020,Nothing good.
15026,(singing) We've got nothing better to do...
15029,(singing) We don't wanna know!
15040,Bender?? I was just not playing the holophonor.
15042,I am trying. (ashamed) I've been taking lessons.
15044,"I know I should but I just can't. Remember when I had those stomach worms that made me smart? I could play the holophonor and it made Leela like me.  Hey Bender, as long as you know, I have a holophonor recital Tuesday and I'd really like to have somebody there. Please?"
15047,Uh...hello Mrs Mellenger.
15052,The...Grumpy Snail.  Sorry.
15054,Ow! No! Quit it! Stop it!
15057,It's hopeless. I can hear all this great music in my head but my stupid hands can't keep up.
15060,Uh...a concert.
15064,(quietly) Pretty boy.
15066,It could be my beautiful soul sitting naked on her couch if I could just learn to play this stupid thing.
15070,Yep. I need to get really good without practicing.
15072,Sure it would.  Oh well. Goodbye.
15074,"He is?  Great! Wait, what's the catch?"
15076,I don't know. It doesn't seem entirely moral to -
15078,Well...alright. You sure I probably won't know him?
15083,Robot Devil? I get your hands? Zam!
15087,Stop being such a baby and chop my hands off.
15089,(impressed) How'd you do that?
15091,At last! At last I have the power to make Leela love me.
15093,Check it out everyone. I'm back from hell and I've got the Robot Devil's hands!
15095,Alrighty!
15097,Uh-oh.
15100,"Yeah, they get around! But I'm afraid we had a deal."
15102,Yes you did.
15106,Show him in.
15109,"Thank you sir, that's exactly what I was going for."
15111,"But, I've never written an opera."
15113,But I wouldn't even know what to write about. Unless...  OK I'll do it. If I can make it about Leela.
15117,Leela!  You shouldn't be listening. I-I don't want you to hear it 'til it's done.
15119,So's a peacock but you don't eat it 'til it's cooked. This has to be perfect. I want you to hear exactly what I hear when I think about you.
15121,(shouting) No!
15177,"Look, what do you want?"
15179,Never!
15195,"(singing) Destiny has cheated me by forcing me to decide upon,"
15201,No!  Stop! Take my hands!
15203,My hands. My horrible human hands. And what did you do to my nails?
15207,But I can't play anymore.
15209,"Ah! Ooo, ah, whoa, hey!"
