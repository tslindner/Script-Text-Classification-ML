1839,bart,"you mean that i should fight dirty, dad?"
1840,homer,"unfortunately, son, we simpsons sometimes have to bend the rules"
1842,homer,"so the next time this bully thinks you're going to throw a punch,"

2021,marge,you do love her don't you?
2023,marge,"well you do, don't you?"
2024,bart,"  don't make me say it.  you know the answer, i"
2025,marge,"okay, bart, you don't have to say it, but you do have to have a"
2032,homer,give me some quarters... i'm doing my laundry.
2034,homer, where's the video boxing?
2038,homer,"  no, me!  no, meeee!  now listen..."
2042,homer,whyyoulittle... woof woof woof!
2044,lisa,"ahem.  [marge waits for her to say something, but lisa turns"
2045,marge,"now lisa, listen to me, this is important.  i want you to smile"
2046,lisa,but i don't feel like smiling.
2047,marge,"well it doesn't matter how you feel inside, you know?  it's what"
2049,marge,"no, come on.  you can do better than that."
2052,lisa,  i feel more popular already.
2061,bart,"i'm gonna knock you out one more time and that's it, this is"
2062,homer," try not to kill me too hard, son.  heh heh heh."
2064,marge,"i'd like your attention, please."
2065,homer,quiet marge!  this is my big moment!  bart the bloody pulp
2066,marge,"i'm sorry, but this is more important than that silly loud game."
2067,bart,you're right mom.  i'd just like to use this occasion to announce
2070,bart,"does it have its own satellite dish, sir?"
2072,homer,does it have a deep fryer?
2075,lisa,this is better than our house!
2077,homer,is that a good siren?  am i approved?
2079,homer,don't you have something that isn't out of my price range?
2082,bart,i hate this.  i don't want to go.
2084,bart,turkey farm?       skunks?       slaughterhouse?
2085,lisa,no.           no.                   no.
2086,marge,what are you kids doing?
2087,lisa,we're playing ``name that odor''.
2092,marge,"homer, i'm telling you, this is not the interstate."
2095,marge,don't worry.  we all are.
2100,lisa, the simpsons have entered the forest.
2102,homer,"yes sir!  this is a real adventure!  why, i bet there are people who"
2103,bart,you mean like <we> just did?
2104,marge,oh homer... what are we going to do?
2105,homer,"now, don't worry.  our situation isn't as bad as it seems."
2111,lisa,"remember, dad.  the handle of the big dipper points towards"
2112,homer,"heh heh, that's nice, lisa.  but we're not in astronomy class."
2130,bart,"murderous mob, i beg you to spare our lives, at least until you've"
2132,bart,uh... about twenty-three minutes and five seconds.
2133,marge,"bart, assume the position."
2140,marge,"can you believe this, homer? ... homer?  homer?"
2142,marge,"  homer, were you planning on sitting in the"
2146,bart,"uh, ma'am?  what if you're a really good person, but"
2152,bart,what about a robot with a human brain?
2154,marge,"lisa, bart, what did you two learn in sunday school today?"
2155,lisa,the answers to deep theological questions.
2156,bart,"yeah, among other things, apes can't get into heaven."
2157,homer,what?  those cute little monkeys?  that's terrible.
2159,homer,"i can understand how they wouldn't let in those wild jungle apes, but"
2160,bart,"cool, man, space mutants 4.  let me off!  let me off!"
2162,homer,"marge, they're only space mutants."
2163,marge,uh uh.  i know what those movies are like.
2164,bart,you guys are sneaking in?
2167,bart,"but sneaking into movies is practically stealing, man."
2170,bart,"well, okay.  i just wanted to make sure we aren't deluding ourselves."
2173,bart,i was wondering.  how important is it to be popular?
2174,homer,"i'm glad you asked, son.  being popular is the most important thing"
2175,bart,"like, sometimes, you could do stuff that you think is pretty bad,"
2176,homer,"you're not talking about killing anyone, are you?"
2180,homer,"then run along, you little scamp!  "
2182,homer,"ooh, look at this one!  the hammer of thor!"
2183,lisa,valhalla is where vikings go when they die.
2190,lisa,this is going to be the best birthday breakfast mom ever had!
2191,bart,"  hey lis, you think that's enough"
2193,lisa,i hope she likes the presents we got her.
2194,bart,[produces a 10-litre jug labelled `french perfume' (in english)]
2195,bart,i get to lick the beaters!
2197,bart,"whago, agh agh aghh!  weetha!  mugh humgb ipht paht im dapt beiter,"

2204,homer,it's my birthday!  what did i get?  i <love> birthdays!
2206,bart,you don't even know your own wife's birthday?
2207,homer,"well, of, ... of course i know!  sure!  "
2208,bart,"oh, right.  what did you get her dad?"
2210,homer,  a very... thoughtful gift... but it's a surprise!
2211,marge,"patty, he's out buying me something right now."
2218,lisa,i think she likes my present better.
2222,lisa,|         |         |does too!
2223,bart,|         |         |         |does not!
2224,lisa,then how come she's not putting on any of your perfume?
2225,bart,"  yeah...  hey mom, how come you're not putting on any of my"
2226,marge,  well i'm saving it... for a special occasion.
2227,bart,what the hell are you talking about?  there's gallons of it!
2229,marge,"  but this occasion is already so special,"
2230,bart,gotcha!    i told you she liked mine better.
2232,homer,"don't worry, this frosting will come right off. "
2233,marge,"well it's hard for me to judge, since i've never bowled in my life!"
2234,homer,"well if you don't want it, i know someone how does..."
2235,marge,"excuse me, where do i throw this?"
2239,marge,"no thanks, i'm just here out of spite."
2245,marge,  hmhmm... thirteen double a.
2249,marge,no no.  homer is my... ball's name.
2251,marge,"no, no thank you mister...  brunswick."
2252,marge,you're a very good teacher!
2254,marge,what do you charge for lessons?
2265,marge,|          |    |    |    |smooth.
2267,marge,|          |    |    |    |       |       |yes.
2275,bart,my compliments to the delivery boy.
2276,homer,"ok, we've eaten and eaten well.  now what else do we have to do?"
2279,homer,"huh?  wah?  oh,  how was bowling?"
2280,marge,it's a very challenging hobby.
2281,homer,"heh heh,  it's a sport dear.  it's a sport you silly thing."
2282,marge,but i think i'll do much better tomorrow night.
2283,homer,  oh!  you're going back?
2284,marge,"oh sure, if you don't mind taking care of the kids again."
2285,homer,"  oh, no,  i don't mind."
2286,marge,"jacques!  it fits, you got it in my size and it has my name on it."
2289,marge,you didn't have to drop me off.
2291,marge,"errrr, jacques!  i'm a married woman!"
2297,marge,"  mmmm, mmmmm... all right!"
2301,lisa,are you going bowling again tonight mom?
2302,marge,"yes i am, as a matter of fact.  [tops up their lunches, to bart's"
2303,bart,"  hmmm, wednesday.  hoagie night!"
2304,marge,"  goodbye lisa, my darling little lisa."
2305,bart,"hmm, great lunches, hey lis?"
2306,lisa,"oh bart, don't you see?  this is what psychologists call over-"
2307,bart,"hey, don't rock the boat man.  whatever it is, we're making out like"
2308,lisa,"bart, i've read about what happens to kids who's parents no longer"
2313,bart,am not!  am not!  am not!
2316,marge,"i'm a married woman, please don't call me that."
2318,marge,"  oooo, well thank you."
2328,marge,you certainly have a lot of bowling trophies.
2334,marge,like two fragile bowling pins.
2341,bart,"hey dad!  whatawe say we toss the old apple around, huh?  sound like"
2342,homer,"son, i don't know if i can lift my head, let alone a ball."
2343,bart,"come on dad, get the lead out."

2346,bart,"lisa, lisa, i think you're right about dad.  there's something very"
2347,lisa,"bart, welcome to stage three, fear."
2348,bart,  well come on!  we've got to do something man!
2349,lisa,"sorry bart, i would love to help you but i am mired in stage five,"
2350,bart,"look dad, i don't know what's going on, but once you gave me some"
2351,homer,i gave you advice?  get outta here.
2352,bart,"yeah, you did.  you told me when something's bothering you, and you're"
2354,homer,"marge, may i.. speak to you?"
2356,homer,"you know, i've been thinking.  everyone makes peanut butter and jelly"
2363,homer,"how can i eat it?  she made it,  it's all i have left."
2364,homer,"marge!  what a lovely surprise!  you're hear to see me, right?"
2367,homer,"tell him i'm going to the back seat of my car, with the woman i love,"
2369,marge,so how was the office birthday party?
2370,homer,"oh, it was de-lightful!  the frosting on the cake was this thick!"
2371,marge,does this girl like him?
2372,homer,"pffft.  i have to warn you marge, i think the poor young thing has the"
2374,homer,"just keepin' you on your toes, babe."
2375,homer,"well, from now on, exercise every morning homer!  [does"
2376,marge,"ooh, don't strain yourself, dear."
2378,marge,"mmmhmmm.  eugene fisk, isn't he your assistant?"
2380,marge,didn't he used to be your assistant?
2381,homer,"hey, what is this!  the spanish exposition?"
2383,bart, oh-ho!  it's the fe-mail-man!
2397,bart,"sorry dad, the answer to that is top secret."
2398,lisa,"ewwww, gross.  momm!  bart was taking a picture of his butt!"
2401,bart,ahoy!  this place bites!
2404,bart,"a-huh-ha-hmm, let's see...   this evening i shall"
2406,bart,"... with extra tentacles, please."
2408,bart,heh heh... urrggghh... 
2409,marge,"bart, quit fooling around and eat your dinner!"
2411,bart, may i please be excused for a minute?
2412,marge,"well okay, but don't dawdle.  your food will get cold."
2419,bart,"  beats me, but the guy dancing with her"
2423,bart,will you swear not to let another living soul get a copy of this
2425,bart,cross your heart and hope to die?
2427,bart,stick a needle in your eye?
2429,bart,jam a dagger in your thigh?
2431,bart,eat a horse-manure pie?
2438,homer,"sorry buddy, you've got me confused with fred flintstone."
2440,homer,whyarreeuumpht...  meaningless!  marge...  don't even attempt to find
2448,homer,"look, marge... honey... baby... doll..."
2449,marge,"  homer, i don't even want to look"
2450,homer,"what are you saying, honey?    but where will"
2451,marge, my suggestion is you sleep in the filth you created!
2455,homer,"oh moe, my wife gave me the ol' heave-ho because of some lousy picture."
2458,homer,"look barney, see the row of tiny lights up there?  the middle one is"
2465,homer,"uh, mister burns, in spite of what everybody thinks, i'm no loverboy."
2467,homer,"i don't really know, sir."
2469,homer,"well oh, wine 'em... dine 'em..."
2471,homer,bring them flowers..  write them love poetry... sir.
2473,homer,"hello marge?  it's me, homer.  are you still mad?"
2475,homer,"you <are> still mad.  don't need to say it, i'm your loving husband, i"
2476,marge,"  homer, you don't even know why you're apologizing."
2477,homer,"yes, i do.  because i'm hungry, my clothes are smelly, and i'm tired."
2478,marge,you taught bart a very bad lesson.  your boy idolizes you.
2480,homer,hey princess!  it's me!  the guy from the snap shot!
2482,homer,"look, i'm here because i want to apologize for treating you like an"
2484,homer,i also want my boy to find out that you're more than just a belly.
2486,bart,nice to meet you ma'am.  
2487,homer,could you tell him a little about yourself?
2498,bart,what can i say?  i got a weakness for the classics.
2499,homer,"  oh, maaarge, i'm still hurt!               \\"
2500,marge,"  oh, homer.  how many times do i have to fluff"
2501,homer,"actually, i was wondering if you could make me a grilled-cheese"
2503,homer,"make sure it's squished flat, and crunchy on the outside."
2504,marge,"i know how you like 'em, homer."
2505,homer,"oh, and can i have some of those wieners that come in a can?"
2507,homer,"oh, hello, principal skinner.  i'd get up, but the boy crippled me."
2510,marge,"deportation!?  you mean, kick bart out of the country?"
2511,homer,"eh, hear him out, marge."
2515,marge,but bart doesn't speak french.
2517,homer,"yeah, but what about bart?"
2520,homer,"you mean, all white with pink eyes?"
2521,bart,"and i'd get to take a plane there, wouldn't i, mom?"
2525,lisa,"you know, in albania, the unit of currency is called the lek."
2527,lisa,and the national flag is a two-headed eagle on a red field.
2528,homer,give me the ol' stars-and-stripes!
2529,lisa,and the main export is furious political thought.
2532,lisa,i'm defending a country where people can think and act
2537,homer,"please, please, kids, stop fighting."
2538,marge,i'll just clean the dishes...
2540,homer,"look, adil, you can call me `dad'."
2542,homer,"awwww, you called me `dad'."
2543,homer,"hey, lenny, does this place have one of those plutonium"
2551,bart,"yeah, but it's got anti-freeze in there."
2553,bart,you gotta help me.  these two guys work me night and day.
2555,homer,"i'm his neighbor, what'd he do?"
2672,marge,"my, all this senseless violence.  i don't understand the appeal."
2673,bart,"we don't expected you to, mom."
2674,lisa,"if cartoons were meant for adults, they'd put them on in prime time."
2681,homer,"bart, you know that guy on your lunchbox?"
2682,bart,"oh, you mean krusty the clown?"
2683,homer,"he's sort of a hero of yours, isn't he?"
2684,bart,are you kidding?  he's my idol!
2691,bart,look at him.  his clothes are so drab.
2692,lisa,his face is so flesh-colored and sad.
2693,bart,and his feet.  they're so small.
2699,bart,"dad, you're giving in to mob mentality!"
2700,homer,"no i'm not, i'm hopping on the bandwagon!"
2708,bart,"i bet i can prove krusty's innocent, but...  i need your help."
2710,bart,"oh, come on, lis, you know why."
2712,bart,"i'll never forgive you for making me say this, but..."
2718,bart,"sure, sideshow bob, but that doesn't bother me."
2719,bart,"attention, fellow children!  krusty didn't rob that store!"
2722,bart,"see that?  krusty wore big, floppy shoes, but he's got little feet,"
2724,bart,but sideshow bob really filled those shoes with these ugly feet!
2731,homer,"hey, turn it up!  i love hearing those wackos!"
2733,marge," when we were dating, he was sweeter... and more"
2743,lisa,"aw, come on, bart, not again!"
2744,bart," aw, where's your sense of humor."
2750,homer,"hey, barney, am i a pig?"
2753,homer,"  uh, i'd like some flowers."
2755,homer,"uh, you know, pretty ones, not dead."
2760,bart, a little pre-dinner entertainment.
2767,homer,"and, i made reservations at chez  paree!"
2768,marge,"oh, but homer, that's expensive!"
2769,homer,"it matters not, mon frere!"
2772,homer,"hello, this is mr... sam-son."
2774,homer,"no, i said samson, not simpson."
2776,bart," oh, man, i can't take it any more!"
2777,lisa,but i want to see what happens.
2778,bart,you <know> what happens.  they find captain quick's treasure.
2779,lisa,"bart, you're just like chilly, the elf who cannot love."
2781,bart,"we know who you are, ms. botz.  or should i say, ms. botzcowski."
2785,lisa,we caught her!  we caught the babysitter bandit!  she's tied up
2786,bart,ask if there's a reward.
2787,lisa,"is there a reward? ...  if she's convicted, we get t-shirts."
2793,homer,"lord help me, i'm just not that bright."
2794,marge,"oh, homer, don't say that.  the way i see it, you raised three"
2808,bart,uhhhhhh... straighten up and fly right?
2810,homer,"marge, could you get me another beer, please."
2811,marge,"just a second, homer.  lisa has some good news."
2813,homer,sure i do!  i just want to have a beer while i'm caring.
2814,homer,"pssst.  marge, come take a look at this."
2815,marge,oh... the little tiger tries so hard.
2816,homer,"just a little dim, i guess."
2819,bart,"hey, otto-man.  i got a big test today i am <not> ready for."
2823,bart,say... who's up for a little cram session?  i'll go first.
2825,bart,  and where'd they land?
2827,bart,and why'd they leave england?
2829,bart,cool!  history's coming alive!
2831,bart,"  think, simpson, think.  crisis brings out the best in you."
2833,bart,  nothing... must... take... test...
2835,bart,"  sharp, stabbing pains... in my stomach."
2839,bart,  huh?  who said that?  come closer...
2840,lisa,"everyone knows you're faking it, bart."
2841,bart,"well, everyone better keep their mouth shut."
2852,bart,"otto, you know i respect you.  i mean, you always let us throw"
2854,bart,"well, i've been failing a lot of tests recently."
2856,bart,"and, now they're talking about holding me back in the fourth grade"
2858,bart,i can make it so the other kids don't laugh at you so much.
2862,bart,perhaps another demonstration.  
2866,bart,"only geeks sit in the front seat.  from now on, you sit in the"
2868,bart,  so no one can see what you're doing!
2871,bart,"well, yeah, but don't say it like that..."
2872,bart," well, old timer, i guess this is the end of the road.  i know"
2873,lisa, prayer... the last refuge of a scoundrel.
2874,bart,"a teachers strike, a power failure, a blizzard... anything that'll"
2877,marge,remember to take a break if your arms go numb!
2879,lisa,"i heard you last night, bart.  you prayed for this.  now your"
2884,bart, we hold these truths to be self-evident...
2886,bart,  that all men are created equal...
2895,bart,gasp!  i passed!  i got a d-!  i passed!  
2896,homer,"we're proud of you, boy!"
2897,bart,thanks dad.  but part of this d minus belongs to god...
2901,marge,"  hitler, north dakota?"
2903,bart,blu|e!     |orange! |red!  purple!                         \&
2906,homer,|yellow!|        |          |red!  white!  black!  green!
2909,homer," of all the rip-off, screw job, chip joint..."
2910,homer,"so i say,  forget you, pal!  thanks for nothing!"
2912,homer,"d'oh!  if i had hair, you wouldn't be calling me that!"
2913,homer,"good morning,  moe's tavern!"
2915,marge,"just between us girls, he hasn't been this frisky in years!"
2919,homer,"come here, you.. heh heh heh."
2938,homer,"well, sir, for one thing, we have a problem every tuesday when"
2940,homer,"well, sir, they cut the head off the fish, then chop up the rest of"
2942,homer, and what does my little girl want?
2943,lisa,an absence of mood swings and some stability in my life.
2944,homer,uh...  how about a pony?
2950,homer,"d'oh!    dirty trick.  okay, i'm not going to kill you,"
2956,homer,"  karl, so that <wasn't> just a sweet voice i heard inside"
2965,homer,  a lot of you would think i was crazy if i did this.
2968,homer,"and the long-term benefits more than offsetting the one-time costs, for"
2970,homer,i dunno.  a hundred and two?
2973,homer,"oh, thank you, thank you, thank you!"
2978,marge,what on earth was that?
2979,homer,probably just the house settling.
2980,lisa,it looks like a vortex.  a gateway into another dimension.
2981,homer,"oooh, a vortex.    catch!"
2982,lisa,  ``quit throwing your garbage into our dimension.''
2983,lisa,i can feel an evil presence in this house.
2985,homer,"quiet, lisa.  you're scaring your mother."
2989,lisa,it's an ancient indian burial ground...
2990,bart,"man, this place has got everything!"
2996,bart,"hey, man, we own you.  let's see some blood!"
2998,bart,"come on, man, do it.  do the blood thing.  come on, do it."
3000,marge,"you, you speak english."
3012,marge,i'm sorry. your game is very nice.
3016,marge," mmmm.  for a superior race, they really rub it in."

3070,homer,"come back here, you little raven!"
3071,homer,"d'ah, grf, son-of-a, d'oh!"
3074,bart,"lisa, that wasn't scary.  not even for a poem."
3075,lisa,well it was written in 1845.  maybe people were easier to
3076,bart,"oh, yeah.  like when you look at ``friday the thirteenth, part 1''."
3081,lisa,"my brother's using worms, but i, who feel the tranquility"
3083,bart,i'm bart simpson.  who the hell are you?
3085,bart,"well, this is my day, and we do, sir."
3086,marge,"well, leave it to good ol' mary bailey to finally step in"
3087,homer," mary bailey.  well, if i was governor, i'd sure find"
3089,homer,like getting washington's birthday and lincoln's birthday
3090,marge,"you're late for work, homer."
3091,homer,so?  someone'll punch in for me.
3092,lisa,"try not to spill anything, dad."
3093,bart,"keep those mutants comin', homer!"
3108,homer,"i bet <you> could afford it, though."
3109,marge,"homer, we're a mary bailey family."
3110,homer,mary bailey isn't going to fire me if i don't vote for her.
3116,marge,i wonder if he's going to say anything about that horrible fish.
3117,homer,"oh, marge.  what's the big deal?"
3124,homer,"i hope burns and i can count on your support, honey."
3125,marge,"homer, i'm a bailey booster."
3126,homer,"oh, yeah?  well, <i'm> a burns booster."
3143,bart,is your boss governor yet?
3149,homer,"oh!  great toast, marge!"
3151,homer,"oh, and some reporters and a camera crew, but you don't have to"
3152,bart,"cool, man!  a media circus!"
3155,marge,mm mm.  i'm going to be ringing doorbells for mary bailey that night.
3156,homer,"d'oh!  kids, pleases leave the room.  i don't want you to see this."
3158,homer, please please please please please please please
3162,lisa,"mm.  well, as long as i'm asking something, can i ask him to"
3164,marge,"well, i think the non-card question is a valid..."
3165,homer,"marge! ... don't worry.  my daughter's very bright, and i'm sure"
3166,homer,"marge, get back in bed."
3167,marge," no, i'm just fine right here."
3168,homer,what's wrong?  i just want to snuggle.
3169,marge,i don't feel like snuggling.
3170,homer,what's that got to do with it?
3177,homer,"oh.  my dreams will go unfulfilled?  oh, no!  i don't like"
3178,marge,"homer, when a man's biggest dreams include seconds on"
3180,homer,there's only one thing worse than being a loser.  it's being one
3184,homer,"you know, boy, some of the players you see tonight may make it"
3185,bart,what?  aren't we going to see any washed-up major-leaguers?
3186,homer,sure!  we get a nice mix here.
3187,marge,last year you got a little rambunctious and mooned the poor umpire.
3188,homer,"marge, this ticket doesn't just give me a seat, it also gives me the"
3194,homer,"uh, it's simp-son, sir."
3197,bart,"  springfield kozy kourt motel, room 26,"
3198,homer,"wow!  flash baylor came onto my wife!  you've still got the magic,"
3202,homer,"don't fill up on those vegetables, kids.  save room for your nachos!"
3206,homer,because they might say no.
3207,lisa,i can't leave springfield!
3208,homer,it won't be so bad.  you'll die someplace else.
3210,homer,"oh, knock it off, flanders; don't start blubbering on me."
3211,lisa,i can't help but feel that if we had gotten to know each other
3215,homer,"well, i get up and dance, and i spell out the name of the city,"
3217,homer, i was too tense to enjoy the game.  every ounce of
3238,homer,"marge, where's the duff!?!"
3239,marge,"ohh, uh, we're all out, homer."
3241,marge,would you like some fruit juice?
3242,homer,"don't toy with me, woman!!"
3244,homer,"well, buggers can't be choosy."
3245,homer,"all right, knock it off!"
3247,homer,you've been rubbing my nose in it since i got here!
3251,homer,i wouldn't stay on a bet! 
3252,homer,lousy bragging know-it-all showoff...
3253,marge,what exactly did he say?
3254,homer,"get this.  he said, uh, he said..."
3255,marge,"well, how did he say it?"
3260,homer,"okay, okay, it wasn't how he said it, either."
3268,homer,  ``you are my brother.''
3272,homer,"``and yet, i feel a great sadness...'' "
3274,lisa,and i'm studying for the math fair.
3275,homer,too bad we don't live on a farm.
3279,homer,that shot is impossible!  jack nicholson himself couldn't make it!
3280,bart,"final score.  bart, forty-one.  homer... let's see..."
3283,bart,wow!  free balloons for everyone who enters!
3286,bart,i guess it's possible...
3288,bart,but dad!  i've never won anything in my life!
3289,homer,"son, this is the only time i'm ever gonna say this.  it is <not>"
3291,homer,what are you doing!  that putter is to you what a bat is
3295,homer,d'oh...  you wanna try a little harder son?  c'mon give it a girl's
3297,homer,your putter's name is charlene!
3299,homer,"it just is, that's why!  now this, is a picture of your enemy,"
3302,bart,grrrrrrrr... rrrrrrrrrrrrr!!!!!!  
3303,marge,"homer, i couldn't help overhearing you warp bart's mind."
3305,marge,i'm worried that you're making too big a deal of this silly little
3306,homer,"but marge, but this is our big chance to show up the flandereses. "
3307,marge,"well, i'm sure it is, but why do we want to do that?"
3308,homer,because sometimes the only way you can feel good about yourself is by
3309,bart,"hey lis, whaddya call those guys in chess that don't matter."
3310,lisa,"well, a blockaded bishop is of little value, but i think you're"
3312,lisa,hmm... i know.  it's times like this that i'm thankful dad has little
3313,bart,"lisa, we can't afford all these books!"
3314,lisa,"bart, we're just gonna borrow them."
3315,bart,"oh... heh, heh... gotcha!  "
3316,lisa,i want you to shut off the logical part of your mind.
3320,lisa,become like an uncarved stone.
3322,lisa,"bart, you're just pretending to know what i'm talking about!"
3324,lisa,"well, it's very frustrating!"
3326,lisa,what is the sound of one hand clapping?
3328,lisa,"no, bart, it's a 3000-year-old riddle with no anwer."
3329,bart,"no answer?  lisa, listen up!  "
3330,lisa,"if a tree falls in the woods and no one's around, does it make a sound?"
3332,lisa,"but bart, how can sound exist if there's no one there to hear it."
3335,lisa,the basis of this game seems to be simple geometry.  all you have
3338,homer,``may the best man win.''  the mating call of the loser!
3339,homer,"keep your left arm straight, bart!  rotate your shoulders!"
3341,homer,"look son, all i'm asking is that you try."
3343,homer,d'oh!  anybody can try!  i want you to <win>!
3346,bart,"aim for the octopus, third tentacle."
3348,bart,bank it off the pink tombstone.
3350,bart,a state of bliss obtained through the extinction of the self.
3351,lisa,oats are what a champion thoroughbred eats before he or she
3352,homer,"newsflash, lisa, bart is not a horse!"
3354,lisa,"bart, having never received any words of encouragement myself,"
3356,homer,"this time tomorrow, you'll be wearing high heels!"
3365,homer,remember what vince lombardi said
3368,bart,"this is pretty tense, isn't it, todd."
3370,bart,who wants to build character?  let's quit!
3391,homer,bart!  stop fighting with your sister!
3393,lisa,"it's not yours, bart.  this is family glue!"
3394,homer,"stop it, you two.  this is thanksgiving, so glue friendly or i'll take"
3395,lisa,"dad, this isn't about glue.  it's about territoriality."
3398,bart,"hey man, i don't want your stupid glue."
3400,homer,"heh heh heh, bullwinkle's antler sprung a leak."
3408,homer,"oh, i love those kids.  they've got such a great attitude!"
3410,homer,"all right bart, that's it!  go to your room!  now!"
3411,bart,"okay, i'll take some white meat and stuffing to go, and"
3413,lisa,"mom, i poured my heart into that centerpiece!  "
3426,marge,"everyone, lisa wants to read us a poem she's written."
3429,lisa,ahem.  `howl of the unappreciated'.  by lisa simpson.  ahem.
3433,bart,"going on five years, kent."
3435,bart,"yes there is, kent.  ha ha!  i didn't apologize!"
3436,marge,"homer, this is a terrible thing that's happened, but we can't"
3438,marge,children need discipline.  you can ask any syndicated advice columnist.
3439,marge,now we can blame him for everything!
3440,homer,it's your fault i'm bald!
3450,lisa,"bart, what are you doing up here?  everybody's worried!"
3454,homer,"oh lord, on this blessed day, we thank thee for giving our family"
3469,lisa,"yes, but i'm afraid the forces of history have changed"
3471,lisa,"oh, bart, i hope you're not taking this seriously."
3472,homer,                                                   \\
3474,homer,"i have an announcement to make.  as a family growth thing, bart and"
3475,lisa,aren't you forgetting something?
3476,homer,"uh... monster truck rally... growth thing.  no, i don't think so."
3478,homer,"oh good, unfinished.  this shouldn't take long."
3481,homer,"come on flanders, he's not <that> bad."
3483,bart,"dad, i want to be a daredevil."
3484,homer,heh heh heh.  kids say such stupid things.
3489,bart,better than all right.  i got stitches!  
3492,marge,"gee, i never realized tv was such a dangerous influence."
3495,bart,"otto, i'm going to leap over springfield gorge on my skateboard."
3501,bart,"hey, otto, can i use that microphone?"
3506,homer,"he's done it, marge; there's nothing we can do."
3507,marge,"you're his father, you've got to try and reason with him."
3508,homer,"oh, that never works.  he's a goner!"
3511,homer,"you were on your way to jump the gorge, weren't you!"
3521,homer,"you know, marge, you make the best pork chops in the whole world."
3522,marge,"oh, homer, they're nothing special.  the extra ingredient is care."
3523,homer,"marge, i'm going to build you a spice rack."
3524,marge,"oh, you don't have to go to all that trouble just for me."
3525,homer,it's no trouble!  i got a whole <garage> of tools i never use!
3527,bart,"hey dad, can you move your head?"
3528,homer,"no, i can't.  it's broken..."
3531,marge,"  no, maggie, bad baby!"
3532,homer,"keep her away from me, marge!"
3533,marge,you won't be watching these cartoons any more.  ever.
3534,lisa,"but mom, if you take our cartoons away, we'll grow up without a sense"
3535,bart,really?  what kind of robots?
3536,marge,what kind of warped human being would find that funny?
3541,marge, and the horse i rode in on?
3544,homer,there's peas in my fruit cobbler!
3545,lisa,there's peas <everywhere>!
3578,marge,couldn't itchy share his pie with scratchy?
3585,lisa,itchy and scratchy seem to have lost their edge...
3586,marge,"well, i think it conveys a very nice message about sharing."
3588,marge,aren't you going to watch the rest of your cute cartoons?
3590,lisa,maybe there's something else to do on this planet...
3596,marge,"mm, but that's michelangelo's david.  it's a masterpiece."
3598,marge,but i like that statue.
3603,homer,"pretty soon, every boy and girl in springfield elementary school"
3612,bart,"um, say, is there anything i can do to avoid coming back here?"
3614,bart,"oh, okay!  see you later, then."
3619,homer,"the doctor says it's just a bump on the head and a broken toe,"
3621,lisa,"excuse me, mr. hutz.  are you a shyster?"
3623,marge,"is he well enough for me to start mothering him unbearably, doctor?"
3625,homer,"if i wasn't so spineless, i'd march into mr. burns' office"
3630,homer,"you don't have to do that, mr. burns.  i can throw <myself> out."
3644,marge,"hm, i didn't know you liked animals."
3646,homer,"mr. burns, are you trying to get me drunk?"
3653,homer,  a million dollars.  my wife cost me a million dollars.
3654,marge,homer?  would you like some more macaroni and cheese?
3655,homer,"  yeah, a million dollars' worth, you treacherous"
3657,homer," no, i don't want any string beans either, you two-timing"
3658,marge,some celery with cream cheese on it?
3661,homer,  moe.  wish he'd shut up.
3662,homer,"  she's been your wife for ten years, you've had"
3664,homer,"but, don't worry.  uh, i'll never let on.  i'll still do all the"
3668,homer,is it done yet?  is it done yet?
3669,marge,"your meatloaf will be ready in eight seconds, homer."
3670,homer,d'oh!  isn't there anything faster than a microwave?
3671,homer,what are you getting at?
3672,lisa,"well, you're always trying to teach me to be open-minded, try new"
3673,homer,what are you talking about?  nobody's trying to teach you that!
3674,marge,"tomorrow night, it might be nice to go out for dinner."
3675,homer,tomorrow night?  friday?  pork chop night?  marge!  we haven't missed
3676,homer,"okay, okay, where do <you> want to go?"
3677,lisa,"anywhere but hamburgers, pizza, or fried chicken!"
3678,homer,fine!  we'll go to mars!
3679,marge,"mm, there's that new sushi restaurant on elm street..."
3680,bart,"sushi?  hey, maybe this is just one of those things you hear on"
3681,lisa,"as usual, the playground has the facts right, but missed the point"
3682,marge,"please, homer, can't we try it? "
3684,lisa,"please, dad, this argument humiliates us both."
3685,homer,"if i said `no' the first time, what makes you think i'm going to"
3686,lisa,"nothing, but you may say `yes' the ninety-ninth time."
3700,bart,"akira, my good man, i'd like two sharks, an octopus and an eel."
3702,bart,do you have any giant squid?  the kind that drags men to their deaths?
3710,homer,no way!  because i'm not dying! 
3714,homer,what's after fear?  what's after fear? 
3716,homer,"doc, you gotta get me out of this!  i'll make it worth your while!"
3718,homer,"well, we all gotta go sometime."
3723,homer,marge!  why did you let me sleep so late?
3724,marge,you looked so peaceful lying there.
3725,homer,there'll be plenty of time for that!
3731,homer,"gee, the fun never stops at the flanders house, does it."
3733,homer,i'll even bring the thickest juciest t-bones you've ever seen.
3735,homer,"heh, the joke's on him!  i'll be dead by then!"
3736,homer,"dad, we've never been too close, have we."
3738,homer,never once went fishing or played catch or even hugged each other.
3743,homer," you gotta help me, barney, i'm in jail."
3745,bart,why are we all dressed up?
3747,lisa,why are we using the good china?
3748,marge,because sometimes it's fun to use the good china.
3749,bart,what's with the candles?
3750,marge,sometimes it's fun to use candles.
3751,lisa,why are we waiting for dad?
3752,marge,because we love your father and enjoy his company.
3753,bart,why are we <really> waiting for dad?
3756,homer,hey burns!  eat! my! shorts!
3761,bart,is seymour there?  last name butz.
3766,marge,"i wrote a poem for you this afternoon, homer.  it's called,"
3768,marge,(ahem.)  the blackened clouds are forming.
3769,homer,"oh, give me a break, marge."
3770,marge,soon the rain will fall.
3772,homer,"do you two have to sit so close to the tv?  back up, or it'll hurt"
3779,homer,time for doctor tv to perform a little surgery!
3780,bart,"looks like you lost the patient, doc."
3785,homer,"okay, everybody remain calm."
3787,lisa,how did dad propose to you?
3791,marge,"lisa, i'd rather tell you a different story ..."
3793,homer,"pffft, english.  who needs that.  i'm never going to england."
3795,marge,"well, not if i have to do heavy lifting or math."
3797,homer,but... we're early for lunch!  let's go grab a burger.
3799,homer,it's my metabomolism.  i guess i'm just one of the lucky ones.
3800,marge,the first step to liberation is to free ourselves from
3802,marge,"mm, i guess it's the tissue paper inside."
3806,homer,"hey, don't worry, barney, it's a big school.  there's got to be a"
3807,homer,"so, uh, what are you in for?"
3808,marge,i'm a political prisoner.  last time <i> ever take a stand...
3809,homer,"well, i'm here for being me."
3811,homer,i haven't seen you in school before.
3815,homer,maybe we should get together sometime.
3817,marge,"i'm sorry, i don't even know your name."
3826,lisa,so it was love a first sight!
3827,bart,"it was a jailhouse romance, man!"
3834,homer,"but dad, i don't drink ..."
3842,homer,me?  i'm gonna drink a lot of beer and stay out all night.
3843,homer,"my name's homer simpson, i'd like to sign up for something."
3847,homer,"i'll take that, you dingpot!"
3852,homer,wait a minute.  that word you keep calling me?
3854,homer,"ignoramus?  it means i'm stupid, doesn't it!"
3856,homer,"not to me, there isn't!"
3864,homer,"marge, when i see you forming the vowels and continents"
3866,homer,"consonants, with your beautiful mouth,"
3867,homer,"my tux is going to have the widest lapels, the most"
3868,marge,and maybe i'll wear my hair ... up.
3873,marge,couldn't we use just rouge for this?
3877,homer,you said you'd go the prom with me.
3878,marge,"i also said i hated you, and we haven't even talked since then."
3879,homer,"i was afraid you'd cancel our date, so i stayed away from"
3889,marge,"homer, we've talked about cable before."
3890,homer,"nothing a month?  yeah, i think we can swing that."
3894,marge,"ooh, that's a good idea."
3896,homer,"ooh, pro wrestling from mexico."
3897,bart,"ooh, this is where jaws eats the boat. ..."
3899,homer,they must think people will watch anything...
3905,bart,all right. i sat through mercy and i sat through forgiveness.
3909,bart,"wouldn't you eventually get used to it, like in a hot tub?"
3913,bart,are there pirates in hell?
3917,marge,"so, what did you children learn about today?"
3920,bart,but that's what we learned about.
3921,homer,"well, the lad has a point."
3924,bart," hell, hell, hell, hell, ..."
3925,marge,"bart, you're no longer in sunday school.  don't swear."
3927,homer,"oh, goodie!  a program-length advertisement!"
3933,lisa,aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa! 
3934,marge,what's gotten into lisa?
3935,bart,beats the hell out of me!
3938,lisa,"mom, what are you doing?"
3939,marge,"what, what do you mean?"
3940,lisa,don't you remember the eighth commandment?
3941,marge,"oh, of course.  it's thou shalt not um not covet, um,"
3942,lisa,thou shalt not steal!!!
3943,lisa,"dad, why is the world such a cesspool of corruption?"
3945,lisa,"well, in sunday school, we learned that stealing is a sin."
3948,homer,"oh.  look at this way, when you had breakfast this morning,"
3950,homer,and did you pay for those clothes you're wearing?
3952,homer,"well, run for the hills, ma barker!  before i call the feds!"
3953,lisa,"dad, i think that's pretty spurious."
3954,homer,"well, thank you, honey."
3963,lisa,"so even if a man takes bread to feed his starving family,"
3971,homer,"hey, lisa... `racing from belmont'?  horsies!"
3972,lisa,"sorry, i'd rather go to heaven."
3974,homer,"hey, how'd you get in here?"
3976,bart,"come one, come all!  top hat theater is on the air!"
3982,homer,"oh, did you swipe those from work?"
3984,homer,"quick, bart!  hide the stuff i borrowed from work!"
3986,homer,"all, right, that stuff i stole from work."
3988,homer,"no!  no, i... it wasn't me.  it was my wife.  my wife's idea."
3994,lisa,"dad, we may have saved your soul."
3996,homer,"yeah, at the worst possible time!"
4000,homer,"marge honey, i've got five words to say to you!"
4001,marge,"oh, homey, remember you told me you'd try to limit pork to six"
4002,homer,marge!  i'm only human!
4005,lisa,do you think you'll ever married?
4009,lisa,"since i'm sure you'd only resent the pity of an eight-year-old niece,"
4012,marge,to be called up whenever and for whatever reason i desire.
4013,homer,but that was just an idle promise!
4014,homer,"which one's selma, again?"
4015,marge,"she's the one who likes police academy movies and hummel figurines,"
4016,homer,"oh, yeah yeah yeah.  but i thought she was the one that didn't like"
4017,marge,it's patty who chose a life of celibacy.  selma simply had celibacy
4018,marge,you will find her  a man!
4022,marge,"he should be honest, and, and caring.  and well-off.  and handsome."
4023,homer,hey!  why should she have a better husband than you do!?
4033,bart,"maybe it was one of the other barts, sir."
4043,homer,"principal skinner, allow me to introduce you to my wife's lovely"
4064,bart,"it's your funeral, seymour."
4081,homer,"oh, dad, you and your imagination."
4088,homer,"this makes me special, dad.  since i'm the one you kept, that"
4090,lisa,a long-lost half-brother.  how dickensian!
4091,bart,"so, any idea where this bastard lives?"
4093,bart,his parents aren't married are they?
4094,homer,i guess he's got us there.
4098,homer,bart!             baart!
4099,homer,"oh brother, where art thou!"
4103,homer,"yeah yeah yeah.  well, i wish i could help you, but we're looking"
4105,homer,"i know he could be <anywhere>,"
4107,homer,"well, if you asked me, changing the subject makes you the"
4109,homer,"oh, i get it!  okay.  here's twenty bucks.  now will you"
4110,homer,hello?  hello?  stupid phone!  
4118,homer,just a little further!!
4119,marge,"bart!  lisa!  if you don't behave, we'll turn this car"
4120,homer,"but marge, i want to see my brother!"
4121,marge,"oh, for god sakes, homer, it's an empty threat."
4135,homer," yeah, though the boy was a close call."
4139,homer,"if i want pork chops any time in the middle of the night,"
4141,homer,"wait, wait, wait.  lemme see if i got this straight."
4144,marge,"well, i met homer in high school.  we got married and had three"
4146,marge,"mm.  actually, i just told you pretty much everything."
4150,marge,i hope we're not spoiling them...
4151,bart,"man, you weren't watching, i did a double gainer with a half..."
4152,lisa,"hey, you didn't see what i did, you didn't watch me dive..."
4153,bart,"unkie herb, can i spit over the side?"
4160,homer,"oh, fine.  they were putting in an onboard something-or-other"
4169,lisa,the mouse is named itchy and the cat is named scratchy.
4171,lisa,and they're not shy about expressing it.
4172,homer,"gee herb, because of me you lost your business, your home, and all"
4174,marge,mm.  maybe he just said that to make conversation.
4177,bart,i thought your car was really cool.
4178,homer,thanks boy!  i was waiting for someone to say that.
4179,marge,"mmm, lisa, you don't look well."
4180,lisa,i'll make it mom.  just tape my lunchbox to my hand.
4181,homer,"maaarge, the dog is hungry."
4184,bart,"no way, she's faking!  if lisa stays home, <i> stay home."
4185,lisa,"if bart stays home, i'm going to school."
4186,bart,"fine, then...  wait a minute..."
4187,marge,"lisa, don't confuse your brother like that."
4189,lisa,oh no.  i don't want to fall behind my class.
4193,homer,but i can't afford to...
4195,homer,"okay, flanders, you're the boss!  heh heh heh."
4196,bart,here's your stupid homework.
4197,lisa,"ooh.  phonics, functions, vocabulary, ... remedial reading?"
4199,marge,those are very elaborate sneakers.
4200,bart,"they better be, for 125 big ones!"
4207,marge,i thought we agreed to consult each other before any major purchases.
4208,homer,"well, you bought all those smoke alarms, and we haven't had"
4211,marge,"oh, homer, there seems to be a lot of good obedience schools here."
4212,bart,"oh, school, right, yeah, that's your answer to everything..."
4217,lisa,"gee, is it always this good?"
4218,marge,mmm.  i don't know.  i just dip in and out.
4224,homer,"oh, so <that's> your little plan.  get us addicted, then jack"
4225,marge,"  my quilt! six generations, ruined!"
4226,homer,"now marge, honey honey honey.  come on, come on, don't get upset."
4227,homer,everybody in the kitchen.  we're having a family meeting.
4228,bart,we never had a family meeting before...
4229,homer,we never had a problem with a family member we can give away before.
4231,lisa,i'm sure mom agrees with me.
4232,marge,"mmm.  no, i'm afraid i agree with your father."
4233,homer,you do?    ha ha ha ha ha.
4234,lisa,"this is our pet.  we can question his integrity and disposition,"
4235,homer," oh, lisa.  if they're ever going to pull the plug on me,"
4238,marge,"you know, <we'll> be old someday."
4239,homer,"gasp!  my god, you're right, marge!  you kids wouldn't put me in a home"
4242,homer,"i can't tell you how sorry i am, dad."
4244,homer,oh no!  dad's lost his hearing!
4259,lisa,"the people who deserve it are on the streets, and they're in the slums."
4261,lisa,"i'll name her princess, and i'll ride her every day!"
4262,homer,"a double cheeseburger, onion rings, large strawberry shake, and"
4310,bart,"okay, lis.  turn on the water works, babe."
4315,homer,"all right, family.  i want the truth.  don't pull any punches."
4316,lisa,"forgive us, dad, but it takes time to properly sugar-coat a response."
4318,homer,"marge, no one gains thirty pounds of bones!"
4320,bart,"hey, homer, i found your weights."
4321,homer," oh, the glutemus maximizer..."
4322,marge,"oh homer, don't be jealous.  i was a schoolgirl."
4324,lisa,maybe you could take a class at springfield community college.
4325,marge,"i think it's a very nice idea.  don't you, homer?"
4326,homer,do i have to do anything?
4328,homer,great!  fine!  go nuts!
4337,marge,"that's wonderful, isn't it kids?"
4339,marge,"kids, remember what i told you about showing a little support?"
4347,marge,"well, no.  just ringo starr."
4353,marge,"what were you like as a boy, mr. burns?"
4355,marge," mr. burns, she's just a baby."
4358,homer,"all right, all right.  who took the funny pages?"
4361,bart,"hey mom, did he have those spots all over his body?"
4366,marge,doesn't it bother you that he orders you around like that?
4378,lisa,"my god, she's been dumped again..."
4397,lisa,no.  homework's not my father's specialty.
4399,bart,that's not enough!  we demand more asbestos!
4401,homer,wow!  you made the front page!
4402,bart,"aw, dad, it's just a popularity contest?"
4403,homer,just a popularity contest?
4407,marge,"lisa needs to go to the museum tomorrow,"
4408,homer,"museum?  tomorrow?  oh, oh, marge, i'd love to, but i was planning"
4409,marge,"homer, i've been talking to lisa, and i'm concerned about your"
4410,bart,"me too, mom.  i think you're drifting apart."
4413,homer,"marge, you don't understand.  i can't do it because..."
4415,homer,"eh, what do you mean by `suggested donation'?"
4417,homer,"and uh, what if i wish to pay ... zero?"
4419,homer,"ooh, so it's up to me, is it?"
4421,homer,i see.  and you think that people are going to pay
4424,homer,"well, if she's so wonderful, give her an a!"
4426,homer,"great, but don't tell her it was a favor to me.  tell her she earned it."
4428,homer,"you are smooth, i'll give you that."
4429,marge,why don't we invite mr. bergstrom to dinner?
4430,lisa,"oh, mom!  that's wonderful!"
4432,lisa,can i wear your jewelry?
4434,lisa,can i get my ears pierced?
4436,lisa,can i dye my shoes pink?
4444,lisa,does bart have to be there?
4446,lisa,can we do it this week?
4456,lisa,"you, sir, are a baboon!"
4458,lisa,"yes, you!  baboon!  baboon!  baboon!  baboon!"
4459,homer,i don't think you realize what you're saying...
4461,bart,"whoa.  somebody was bound to say it someday, i just can't believe"
4464,homer,i promised i wouldn't eat?  never!  you lie!
4465,homer,never thrown a party?  what about that big bash we had with all
4468,marge,"oh, they're here.  how does everything look?"
4470,marge,do we have enough glasses?
4471,homer,do we have enough gag ice cubes?
4472,marge,"homer, homer, put a record on."
4473,homer,what are all our friends' names again?
4474,homer,"hey, flanders, next time why don't you put a little alcohol in it!"
4476,homer,"really?  well, i do have a warm sense of well-being, and i sheem"
4477,marge,"homer, go easy on the alkyhol.  remember last year at the winfields'"
4481,marge,"thank you, i will, dr. hibert.  thanks for coming."
4483,bart,they're fighting in the car again.
4484,lisa,that music always sends a chill down my spine.
4485,marge,you are going to stay here and explain to bart why you scarred
4486,homer,"no, i didn't!  i ... oh, you mean inside, don't you."
4487,homer,about last night.  you might have noticed daddy acting a little
4488,bart,i understand why.  you were wasted.
4489,homer,"i'm sorry it happened, and i just hope you didn't lose a lot of respect"
4490,bart,"dad, i have as much respect for you as i ever did or ever will."
4494,marge,"grampa, could you do something?"
4496,bart,"grampa, mom was in such a hurry, she forgot to give you this."
4498,bart,"after the supermarket, we'll go to the video store, grab a krusty"
4499,lisa,"bart, grampa's a kindly old man.  he trusts us.  are you sure it's"
4500,bart,"lis, in these crazy topsy-turvy times, who's to say what's right or"
4502,homer,i see.  he also understands bowling expressions.
4504,homer, oh.  lucky they don't keep guns in the house.
4508,homer,"well, sometimes it can be annoying."
4509,marge,"he chews with his mouth open, he gambles, he hangs out at a seedy"
4513,lisa,half a gallon of chocolate.
4515,lisa,half a gallon of chocolate brownie fudge.
4517,lisa,half a gallon of chocolate chocolate chocolate chocolate chip.
4520,lisa,"grampa, what a question!"
4525,bart,"  hey grampa, top me off."
4527,bart," for the last time, yes!"
4532,bart,"not yet, but the afternoon is young."
4534,lisa,isn't it obvious?  we've degraded ourselves and set back the children's
4535,bart,"you're great at a party, lis.  really great."
4536,bart,"lisa, i have this strong unpleasant feeling i've never had before."
4537,lisa,"it's called remorse, you vile burlesque of irrepresible youth."
4542,lisa,"if we don't get to the convention soon, all the good comics will"
4543,bart,"ah, what do you care about good comics?  all you every buy is casper"
4544,lisa,"i think it's sad that you equate friendliness with wimpiness, and"
4545,bart,"well, you know what i think?  i think casper is the ghost of"
4546,lisa,"hey, they do look alike!"
4547,bart,wonder how richie died.
4548,lisa,perhaps he realized how hollow the pursuit of money really is and
4549,marge,"kids, could you lighten up a little?"
4556,bart,"wow, radioactive man #1!  i bet it's worth a million bucks!"
4559,bart,i need a hundred dollars for a comic book.
4560,homer,"a hundred bucks for a comic book?  who drew it, michael milangelo?"
4561,bart,i want this more than anything in the world.
4584,homer,"no!  now look, son, we all know that usually when you bug me like"
4606,homer,"hoo hoo!  i win!  in your face!  yeah, how do you like them apples?"
4612,marge,maybe a part-time job is the answer.
4613,bart,"oh, mom, i couldn't ask you to do that.  your already taking care"
4614,lisa,"she means <you> should get a job, stupid!"
4615,bart,  me?  get a job?  were they
4616,homer,bart!  what are you staring at?
4617,bart,"uh, nothing.    he didn't say it, and neither"
4621,bart,ching-ching-ching!  [smashes a souvenir coin collection he received
4623,bart,all those coins were only worth three lousy cents?
4627,bart,"no, not today, i need the dime."
4637,bart,"listen lady, i can leave without screaming, and i can"
4639,homer,"hey, when i was your age, fifty cents was a lot of money."
4642,bart,i am through with working.  working is for chumps.
4643,homer,"son, i'm proud of you.  i was <twice> your age before i figured"
4648,bart,can i have it for thirty-five?
4649,bart,"look pal, we got a hundred bucks and we'd like to buy"
4657,bart," yeah, what <about> sundays?"
4666,bart,"hey, martin, tell him what we do with squealers."
4668,bart,"we worked so hard, and now it's all gone."
4670,bart,nothing.  just kind of ticks me off.
4678,homer,"hee hee.  joke's on them.  if the core explodes, there won't be any"
4680,lisa,"it's like an ox, only it has a hump and a dewlap."
4681,homer,don't you know the story of hercules and the lion?
4683,homer,"yeah, probably.  anyway, once upon a time, there was a big mean lion"
4684,bart,how did a lion get rich?
4697,homer,"marge, lisa, maggie, let's do this out in the yard where the neighbors"
4699,marge,"homer, you don't do things like that to be rewarded.  you do"
4700,homer,"marge, you're my wife, i love you very much, but "
4701,bart,"yeah, mom, we got hosed."
4704,homer,"heh heh heh.  good.  `you are a senile, buck-toothed old mummy,"
4706,homer,hee hee.  `an elephant's butt.'
4708,homer,"i'll get our letter so wet, the ink will run and no one will"
4709,bart,"yeah, but don't other people have mail in there?"
4710,homer,"so a few people won't get a few letters, boo hoo!"
4711,homer,i guess it wouldn't do any good to run 'cause you're a mail-lady and you
4713,homer,well.. i'm still going to run. 
4719,lisa,"ooh, look, maggie!  what is that?  dodecahedron!  dodecahedron!"
4720,homer,"lisa, i don't know what you're doing, but it's very strange, and"
4722,homer, don't tell him.  give him a fake name.
4724,bart,you always told me i was going to destroy the family.  but i never
4725,lisa,"that's okay, bart.  nobody really believed it."
4727,bart,"uh, hello.  is mike there?  last name, rotch."
4730,homer,"i got my problems, moe.  give me another one."
4735,lisa,"it's to open the crate, stupid."
4737,lisa,"no, maggie.  not aztec, olmec.    ol-mec."
4739,homer,"save a guy's life, and what do you get?  nothing!  worse than nothing!"
4740,bart,"hey, man, don't bad-mouth the head."
4741,marge,"homer, it's the thought that counts.  the moral of the story is a"
4742,bart,"hey, we <got> a reward.  the head is cool."
4743,marge,then... i guess the moral is no good deed goes unrewarded.
4744,homer,"wait a minute.  if i hadn't written that nasty letter, we wouldn't've"
4745,marge,well... then i guess the moral is the squeaky wheel gets the grease.
4746,lisa,perhaps there is no moral to this story.
4747,homer,exactly!  just a bunch of stuff that happened.
4748,marge,but it certainly was a memorable few days.
4752,bart,"hey, we're just like the waltons.  we're praying for an end"
4754,bart,lisa!  it's 6am!  something's wrong.  dad died!
4756,bart,"well, whaddya know, i'm relieved."
4757,lisa,"bart, my birthday's in two days.  i'm going to be eight years old."
4758,bart,"well, enjoy it while you can.  everything changes when you hit the"
4759,lisa,"bart, will you please let me pour my little heart out?"
4760,bart,"sorry, this old-timer does ramble on sometimes, don't he."
4761,marge,"bart, i asked you to watch your sister ."
4762,bart,"i tried to stop her, but she overpowered me!"
4772,homer,"lisa, you like homework.  could you fill out this form for me?"
4773,lisa,"well, all right.  if you'll listen to the poem i just wrote."
4775,lisa,"meditations on turning eight, by lisa simpson."
4777,bart,"dad, maybe you should do this."
4778,homer,"son, it's no different than the time i let you vote for me."
4786,homer,dog on fire!  dog on fire!
4787,bart,"hey, dad, do you hear voices?"
4788,homer," yes, i'm hearing one right now while i'm trying to watch tv..."
4789,bart, yes.  are you quick to anger?
4790,homer,bart!  shut up or i'll shut you up!
4791,bart," yes.  do you wet your pants?  well, even the best of us"
4793,homer,"eh, the devil with his fly open."
4795,homer,"uh, that's a spill on the floor with bugs going after it.  uh, they're"
4798,homer,this isn't fair!  how can you tell who's sane and who's insane?
4802,homer,"i'm homer simpson, from the simpsons..."
4805,homer,"oh, of <course> i've heard of you!  i mean, you'd have to be living"
4815,homer,what was that last one?
4819,homer,wow!  how do you do that thing with your feet?
4821,homer,"no, that thing with your feet!"
4825,homer,'cause i wore a pink shirt.
4830,lisa,"bart, in the split second before he died,"
4831,bart,"hey, you want that once-a-year empty gesture?  you got it, sis."
4833,homer,okay.  five times nine.
4836,homer,"i gotta call my family.  oh, this is so embarrassing, calling them"
4838,homer,"oh great.  and uh, try to put a good face on it."
4840,bart,i'm bart simpson.  who the hell are you?
4843,bart,<the> michael jackson?    no way!
4845,bart,uh huh.  and is elvis with you?
4850,bart,"well, there's probably a down side i don't see."
4851,bart,"hey, mom!  dad's in a mental institution!"
4852,marge,"oh, my god... mother was right!"
4858,marge,i told you kids you were going to send your father to the crazy house!
4859,bart,"no, mom, you said poor house."
4865,homer, pancakes... football... boobies...
4878,marge,"doctor, if you just talk to him for five minutes without mentioning"
4881,homer,that's the most flattering thing anyone has ever said to me.
4883,homer,"if you ever find your marbles, come visit us."
4889,homer,are you <sure> you're here voluntarily?
4893,lisa,"bart, the entire town is howling for your blood, and before i join"
4894,bart,"you know, maybe you should trust that instinct and not ask."
4895,bart,"i can't write a song, i'm only ten."
4897,bart,"looney toons, this is what michael jackson looks like."
4900,bart,that's 'cause she knows you're looking at her.
4901,lisa,"  although i'm aware you're looking at me, i would look"
4903,bart,"well, your training wheels come off your bike..."
4905,bart,you're just putting that in because it's commercial.
4908,bart,"hey, michael, what happened to your voice?"
4910,homer,"not me, i've got this!  "
4912,lisa,you're a credit to dementia!
4926,homer,[receives a sweepstakes junk mail with a `you may have already won'

4931,homer,i had a feeling it was too good to be true.
4932,lisa,i don't think real checks have exclamation points.
4933,marge,"well, at least we got a free sample of reading digest."
4934,homer,"marge, i never read a magazine in my life, and i'm not going to start"
4936,marge,"no, it's not the truth, homer.  it's well-documented that women are"
4937,homer,"oh, marge, cartoons don't have any deep meaning.  they're just"
4941,homer,"as tolstoi said in quotable notables, ``give me learning, sir,"
4947,marge,you've certainly taking a shine to that magazine.
4948,homer,"it's not just <one> magazine, marge; they take <hundreds> of"

4954,homer,"wow, `win a trip to washington, dc.  all expenses paid, vip tour'..."
4956,lisa,"thanks for driving me to the contest, dad."
4957,homer,"sweetheart, there's nothing i wouldn't do for that magazine."
4960,homer,"playing cards, note pad, aspirin, sewing kit, pilot's wing pin,"
4963,bart,no thank you.  i'd rather push this button.
4965,homer,aagh!  we're all going to die!  
4969,lisa,have either of you ever run into any problems because of your superior
4974,homer,"miss, what does the `i' stand for?"
4976,homer,ooh.  how about the `v'?
4978,homer,"oh.  and miss, just one more question."
4980,homer,ah... what does the `i' stand for again?
4981,bart,"  on this spot, richard nixon bowled"

5033,bart,cesspool!  cesspool!  cesspool!  cesspool!
5036,homer,i'll be there!    notty-notty-not.
5041,marge,"bart, how many hours a day do you watch tv?"
5042,bart,six.  seven if there's something good on.
5055,bart,"um, excuse me, sir.  i already know how not to hit a guy."
5057,bart,"akira, my good man, when do we break block of ice with our heads?"
5059,bart,"yo, sensei.  can i go to the bathroom?"
5061,bart,"  pay money to read books, pffft.  the hell with this!"
5062,lisa,"dad, do you know what schadenfreude is?"
5063,homer,"no, i do not know what shaden-frawde is."
5064,lisa,"it's a german term for `shameful joy', taking pleasure in the suffering"
5065,homer,"oh, come on lisa.  i'm just glad to see him fall flat on his butt!"
5067,homer,"boy, those germans have a word for everything!"

5141,lisa," bart, is your boss a crook?"
5142,bart,i don't think so.  although it would explain an awful lot.
5143,bart,"uh, say, are you guys crooks?"
5153,marge,i'm not sure about the people bart's working for.
5154,homer,"a job's a job.  i mean, take me.  if my plant pollutes the water"

5320,bart,i had a fight with milhouse.
5321,homer,that four-eyes with a big nose?  you don't need friends like that.

5455,lisa,"bart, we're going to have to outsmart him."
5456,bart,"i dunno, he's pretty sharp.  he saw right through this disguise."
5468,lisa,"bart, we've been going about this all wrong.  what's the one thing"
5470,bart,"at all times, let a man be supple as a reed and not rigid"

5605,homer,"  lisa, stop playing that stupid... saxophone!  yes, that's it!"
5609,homer,"look, i let you down, and i apologize.  i know that doesn't make it"
5611,homer,d'oh!  you didn't mean that!

5627,homer,"marge, with today's gasoline prices, we can't afford <not>"
5628,marge,you sound like you're going to buy a pony.  promise me you won't.
5630,marge,what was that?  was that a yes or a no?
5632,marge,those aren't even words!
5636,homer,"excuse me, do you sell ponies?"
5640,homer,"now lady, i'm buying a pony for my little girl, and i don't care what"
5642,homer,half a million dollars!?
5659,marge,mmm...  i am <very> upset with you.
5660,homer,sounds like someone's angling for a pony of her own!
5661,bart,"hey, how come lisa gets a pony?"
5662,homer,because she stopped loving me.
5663,bart,"i don't love you either, so give me a moped."
5664,homer,"well, i know you love me, so you don't get squat.  hee hee hee."
5665,marge,"homer, just where were you planning to keep this horse?"
5666,homer,"i got it all figured out.  by day, it'll roam free around the"

5689,homer,"well, you know, we're always buying maggie vaccinations for diseases"
5690,homer,there's plenty of money out there for a guy who's willing to work
5694,homer,you're looking for help?
5705,homer,"marge, could we go in the other room?"
5707,homer,"  i'll work from midnight to eight,"
5708,bart,"  oh my god, she killed him!"
5709,marge,"homer, how long do you plan to do this?"
5710,homer,i don't know.  how long do horses live?

5822,bart,"because i'm jinxed, dammit!"
5824,bart,ow!  what was that for!?
5825,homer,"you spoke while you were jinxed, so i get to punch you in the arm!"
5826,homer,"what's the matter, moe?"

6001,homer,"don't you ever, ever talk that way about television."
6004,marge,i can't imagine that job of yours is very stimulating.
6005,homer,but it gives me time to think.

6018,homer,really?  it <must> be the champale talking.
6022,marge, so you've ruined your life.
6024,homer,because it's the honorable thing to do?

6127,homer,"well, he fell down a well, and... he can't get out."
6128,lisa,how does that make him a hero?
6129,homer,"well, that's more than you did!"
6141,homer,"it's not our fault!  we didn't want the boy, he was an accident!"
6143,homer,uh...  could you edit that last part out?
6147,marge,"bart honey, i made you an extra-warm sweater you can wear while you're"
6149,homer,"don't worry, you'll grow into it."
6151,marge,"sting, you look tired.  maybe you should take a rest."
6153,marge,"actually, i don't know if i've ever heard bart play one of your albums."
6154,homer,"shhhh.  marge, he's a good digger!"
6157,lisa,why isn't dad ever interested in anything i do?
6158,marge,"well, um, do you ever take an interest in anything <he> does?"
6159,lisa,"no. ... well, we used to have burping contests, but i outgrew it."
6161,homer,why didn't you say that before!!
6167,homer,"yeah, lay it on me, coach."
6177,homer,"come on, come on, don't you realize this is costing me money!"
6178,bart,"you know why these clothes are on sale, mom?"
6179,marge,"well, anyone who beats you up for wearing a shirt isn't your friend."
6180,homer,"you like ice cream, don't you?"
6182,homer,and don't you like ice cream better when it's covered with hot fudge?
6183,homer,your mother has this crazy idea that gambling is wrong.
6185,homer,uh... somewhere in the back.
6187,lisa,can i watch football with you again next sunday?
6188,homer,sure!  you'll find it gets rid of the unpleasant aftertaste of church.
6192,homer,what?  didn't you hear what he said?
6193,lisa,"look at the fear in his eyes, listen to the quiver in his voice."
6194,homer,you think we should bet against them?
6195,lisa,i'd bet my entire college fund on it.
6196,homer,"you got it.    moe, twenty-three dollars on new york!"
6202,lisa,"dad, i hate to break the mood, but i'm getting nauseous."
6203,homer,who do you like in the afternoon games?
6204,lisa,"well, i like the 49ers because they're pure of heart,"
6206,lisa,"hey, the new sign's really working!"

6212,homer,"hello, i'm homer, i'll be your customer."
6222,homer,"well, lisa, it's daddy-daughter day, and daddy needs daughter's picks."
6223,lisa,"dad, i'm making the chiefs my five-star silver bullet special."
6225,homer,"barney, are you nuts?  that's the super bowl!"
6229,lisa,"oh, dad!  you must have bought me every malibu stacy accessory there"
6230,homer,not quite.  they were out of malibu stacy lunar rovers.
6231,homer,"boy, i know you're going to like your present."
6234,bart,"dad, i promise you, i will <never> get tired of this."
6235,marge,"homer, those were very thoughtful presents, but you have to tell"
6236,homer,"all right, marge, i'll tell you, but first you have to promise you"
6237,marge,"i promise i <will> get mad, because i always do when you make me"
6238,homer,"all right, if you must know.  lisa and i have been gambling on pro"
6240,homer,you promised you wouldn't get mad!
6241,homer,aren't parents supposed to encourage their kids whenever they show
6242,marge,but gambling is illegal!
6243,homer,"oh, only in 48 states.  besides, it's a victimless crime."
6247,lisa,"look, dad.  i'll tell you who's going to win the super bowl if you"
6261,homer,buffalo is going to win.  lisa hates me. 
6266,homer,not duff dry.  washington!

6359,marge,i bet we could buy a nice doghouse for $50.
6360,homer," marge, you're a tool of doghouse makers."
6362,homer,"yes, you are.  you've been brainwashed by all those doghouse"
6363,homer,i'll build him a doghouse. 
6365,homer,"don't worry, i just drew up a little blueprint."

6408,homer,"look, if it's about the camcorder, i <lost> it, okay?"
6410,homer,what the hell are you talking about?
6412,homer,"oh, come on, flanders.  i don't complain about your... ..."
6414,homer,makes it look like you got something to hide.
6416,homer, people are talking...  lots of people.
6417,homer,"hey, marge.  you wanna hear something funny?  flanders thinks i"
6418,marge,"well, you know, maybe he's right."
6419,homer,"well, what a surprise!  marge sticks up for flanders!"
6420,marge,"actually, homer, <you> brought up ned flan---"
6424,homer,"boy, you've got to go to your teacher and tell her the truth!"
6425,marge,"no, homer, the truth will humiliate her!"
6426,homer,"oh, marge, i only said it because i thought that's what you wanted"
6427,bart,"how about, ``crocodiles bit off my face.''"
6428,marge,"that's disgusting!  and besides, when a woman lives a man, it"
6429,homer,"i may hold you to that, marge."

6481,homer,"well, are you better than me?"
6483,marge,what makes you think this darryl strawberry character is better
6484,homer,"marge, forget it.  he's bigger than me, faster than me, stronger"
6485,bart,"you make me sick, homer.  you're the one who told me i could do"
6486,homer,"well, now that you're a little bit older, i can tell you that's"
6487,bart,"gotcha.  can't win, don't try."

6503,homer,"i did!  woo-hoo!  woo-hoo!  in your face, strawberry!"
6509,homer,"oh, one thing i'm good at and i can't do it any more."
6510,marge,"homey, you're good at lots of things."
6513,homer,yeah.  but none of my friends can watch me.
6521,homer,where do you think you're going?
6523,homer,no no no.  i don't want you to see me sit on my worthless butt.
6526,lisa,"janey, school is <never> a waste of time."
6531,bart,police officer!?  well i'll be jiggered!
6533,bart,"hey, i don't need you to get me in the back of a police car."
6534,homer,"so what are <you> going to be, boy?"
6537,marge,"you know, your father wanted to be a policeman for a little while,"
6538,homer,"no, the army said i was too heavy.  the police said i was too dumb."
6539,lisa,"well, <i'm> going to be a famous jazz musician.  i've got it all"
6540,marge,"honey, if that's what you want, we'll do anything we can to help."
6541,bart,wow!  can i see your club?
6545,bart,"so, you guys like being cops?"
6548,bart,do you need straight a's to be a cop?
6556,bart,"that's right, man.  i got my first taste of authority..."
6557,marge,bart's grades are up a little this term.
6558,homer,oh... we always have one good kid and one lousy kid.
6559,marge,"we have <three> kids, homer."
6560,homer,"maaarge, the dog doesn't count as a kid!"
6562,bart,"seymour, this is an absence slip signed by nelson's mother."
6569,lisa,"well, you're earning <your> eighteen grand a year. "
6578,bart,"seymour, i'll bet you a steak dinner those books are still here."
6580,bart,pfffffft.  supreme court.  what have <they> done for us lately?
6605,homer,"you'll never guess what happened, marge.  are you ready?"
6607,homer,"i know you're excited, but calm down and listen to me carefully..."
6608,marge,"homer, we're on a tight budget, here.  promise me you won't get"
6609,homer,"yes, money.  ...  i mean, honey."
6618,bart,is there a doggie hell?
6619,homer,"well... of course, there couldn't be a heaven if there weren't a hell."
6621,homer,"oh, uh... hitler's dog... and that dog nixon had, what's his name,"
6623,homer,"yeah!  one of the lassies is in there, too.  the mean one!"
6624,marge,"honey, $750 is a lot of money.  we really can't afford this operation."
6625,bart,you're gonna just let him  die?
6628,marge,"bart, watch your language! ... oh, you did.  sorry."
6632,marge,i found a way to stretch the food budget.
6634,marge,... will now be chub night.
6635,homer,chub!?  i don't even know what that is!
6636,homer,"hey, how come he  gets meat and we don't?"
6637,marge,you wouldn't want what he's eating.  it's mostly just snouts and
6639,homer,"well, he's got all the money in the world, but there's one thing"
6644,homer,"``wait, there he is!  ...  no, that's a horse...''"
6646,marge,"homer, get a hold of yourself.  even if he  <has> passed on,"
6647,homer,"oh, marge, there is no such place!"
6649,homer,  or...  to put it another way...  there <is>...
6650,bart,i'm not giving up.  i don't care if i have to knock on every door
6651,homer,and i'll be right here watching tv.
6653,bart,"um, excuse me, sir.  i lost my dog."
6658,bart,"if you don't watch the violence, you'll never get desensitized to it."
6659,lisa, please tell me when the scary part's over.
6670,homer,maybe.  i'm not sure.  i forgot it.
6678,homer,"well, right now, she's an out-of-work cocktail waitress,"
6680,homer,"well, now, i was going to ask you for a glass of water, but now"
6682,homer,"hey!    you <did> say sugar, right?"
6684,homer,"really?!  well, i should warn you, i'm not great with figures."
6686,homer,i make a lot of stupid decisions.
6690,homer,my personal hygeine has been described as...
6691,homer,"marge, you're standing in the way of my boyhood dream of"
6692,marge,your boyhood dream is to eat the world's biggest hoagie!
6693,marge,"homer, how much did you just give that man!?"
6694,homer,"calm down, marge, it's just our life savings.  i'm not going into hock"
6695,marge,hm...  i thought you said she was overweight.
6696,homer,"marge, it takes two to lie.  one to lie and one to listen."
6697,homer,"guess what, lurleen.  i got you a gig on tv!"
6699,homer,"  oh, you meant that as a compliment."
6700,marge,"all our money's tied up in this woman.  if she fails, we're broke."
6705,bart,coooool!  he can teach us how to kill a man with a lunchtray!
6706,homer,"gee, if some snot-nosed little kid sent <me> to prison,"
6720,bart,"don't be a fool, aunt selma!  that man is scum!"
6725,marge,"now, about your wedding dress.  mmm, i'm not sure how to put this..."
6728,homer,you can't go wrong with cocktail weenies!  they taste as good as
6741,homer,"i hate all the programs marge likes, but it's no big deal."
6744,homer,"whenever marge turns on one of her ``non-violent'' programs,"
6746,lisa, <i> could've been the flower girl.  and i wouldn't keep
6747,bart,"hey, they chose maggie, okay?"
6748,lisa,"yeah, well, if you want to go for cutesiness instead of competence, fine."
6763,bart,"chief wiggum, think you have room in your jail for a two-time loser?"
6767,bart,"well, i'd hate to tell the number one cop in town how to do"
6770,bart,"hey, milhouse, cool jacket!"
6772,homer,now just meet me back here after the show.
6773,bart,"thanks, dad.  sure you're not going to be bored?"
6774,homer," boy, some of the best times i've ever had were in the"
6777,homer,"now, boy, we spent a lot of money, so you'd better get real good"
6779,homer,"hey, i thought i was supposed to encourage him."
6780,bart,"i didn't know you played the guitar, otto-man!"
6783,lisa,we don't have seat belts.
6792,bart,otto-man?  you're living in a dumpster?
6796,bart,"mom, i thought you might forget our little conversation this"
6800,homer,"marge, what were you thinking!"
6802,homer,"oh, everybody says that when they hear themselves on tape."
6804,homer,"forget it!  that line didn't work for my dad, and it's not"
6805,marge,"doesn't the bible say, ``whatsoever you do to the least of my brothers,"
6806,homer,"yes, but doesn't the bible also say ``thou shalt not take... moochers"
6807,bart,"please, dad?  if you let otto stay, he'll help around the house and"
6808,homer,"all right, he can stay.  but i get to treat him like garbage."
6810,homer,"will you knock it off, i can't hear myself think!"
6811,homer,"hey, how come you never play your guitar any more?"
6812,bart,"i'll tell ya the truth, dad.  i wasn't goot at it right away, so"
6813,homer,"  son, come here!  heh heh heh..."
6814,bart,"what are you going to do, otto?"
6816,bart,"you can do it, otto!  you're the coolest adult i ever met!"
6819,bart,cool!  an oversized novelty billiard ball!
6829,bart,"how would i go about creating a half-man, half-monkey-type creature?"
6831,bart,god shmod!  i want my monkey-man!
6837,bart,"hey, what's with the skirt?"
6839,bart,"yeah, but never a girl.  what if i want to strut around nude?"
6841,lisa,"dad, what if i told you you could lose weight without dieting"
6842,homer,i'd say you're a lying scumbag!
6843,lisa,they'll send you tapes you listen to while you sleep.
6844,homer,lose weight <and> listen to new age music?  wow!
6845,marge,"homer, has the weight loss tape reduced your appetite?"
6846,homer,"ah, lamentably no.  my gastronomic rapacity knows no satieties."
6854,lisa,"hey, bart, according to this magazine, in another million years,"
6855,bart,five fingers?  ewwww!  freak show!
6856,homer,"marge, where's that...  metal deely... you use to... dig... food..."
6859,bart,how are we going to find her?
6861,bart,"hey, samantha, i'm sorry about getting you thrown in the"
6887,marge,"how was your day at work, dear?"
6888,homer,"oh, the usual.  stand in front of this, open that, pull down"
6903,homer,"all right, who did this?"
6904,bart,we were just sitting on the couch quietly chatting when we heard
6905,lisa,we leapt off just in time to see it collapse.
6906,bart,"there, there, you're safe now, little sister."
6914,lisa,this show is the biggest farce i ever saw!
6917,homer," please, please, please, please, please!"
6935,homer,"well, while you're a guest in my home, could you just kick me"
6937,marge,herb! how have you been?
6940,bart,"unckie herb, what advice would you give to a young boy who"
6942,lisa,"why didn't you write, unckie herb?"
6947,lisa,"and while on ventnor avenue, you'll be staying at the fabulous"
6955,homer,"all right, herb. i'll give you the money, but first you"
6957,homer,"all right, then just give me the drinking bird."
6960,bart,not really.  we snuck a peek while you were in the john.
6961,homer,"i can't believe we spent $2,000 on this when right now rollers"
6971,homer,"all right, but i never really hugged a man before."
6973,bart,"how do i know this isn't some beautiful dream, too?"
6975,bart,"ow!  you know, a pinch is more traditional."
6976,marge,"homer, you do remember your promise to the children?"
6978,homer,"sure do!  when you're 18, you're out the door!"
6994,bart,"well dad, here's my report card.  i think you'll be pleasantly"
6995,homer,"  a-plus?!?  you don't think much of me, do you boy?"
6997,homer,you know a d turns into a b so easily.  you just got greedy.
6998,bart,so i won't get to go to camp?
6999,homer," now bart, we made this deal because i thought it"
7001,homer,yeah.  i didn't want you hangin' around all summer anyway.
7003,marge,it's our last family dinner for six weeks.  but i promised myself i
7004,marge,"  oh, i'm going to miss this."
7005,marge,"lisa, watch out for poison ivy.  remember,"
7006,homer,"``leaves of four, eat some more!''  heh heh heh."
7007,bart,"don't look in my closet.  in fact, stay out of my room altogether."
7008,lisa,"if the pets die, don't replace them, i'll know!"
7012,bart,don't we get to roast marshmallows?
7014,lisa,"uh, are your sure that's safe?"
7030,lisa,you're serving us gruel?
7032,lisa,"i feel like i'm gonna die, bart."
7033,bart,"we're all gonna die, lis."
7041,bart,we want the whole world to know that this was a really crappy camp.
7044,lisa,oh yeah!?  who played your daughter in the short-lived sitcom
7046,bart,"krusty!  this camp was a nightmare!  they fed us gruel, they forced"
7048,bart,"well, actually, the bear just ate his hat."
7077,marge,"well, i feel guilty for not missing them."
7081,marge,i thought it would be a good chance to meet some other adults.
7083,marge,"you know, i spend all day home with maggie.  sometimes it's"
7085,marge,maybe i should've a nice calligraphy class.
7088,bart,are there any jive-talking robots in this play?
7090,homer,"bart, don't ask stupid questions."
7094,marge,"for god's sakes, you can pull the lid off your own can of pudding!"
7096,marge,i'm sure you won't enjoy it.
7097,homer,probably not much of it.
7098,marge,why can't you be more supportive?
7100,homer,"i can't fake an interest in this, and i'm an expert at faking an"
7102,homer,"you know, the painting class, the first aid course,"
7103,homer,"it really got to me how that lady, uh...  you know which one i mean."
7134,marge,your father's ... resting.
7135,bart,"resting hung over?  resting got fired?  help me out, here."
7140,marge,are you actually giving up your faith?
7144,homer,"  uh, kind-of...  b-but..."
7146,homer,"i'm not a bad guy!  i work hard, and i love my kids.  so why should"
7149,homer,"naw, they moved to phoenix."
7151,lisa,why are you dedicating your life to blasphemy?
7152,homer,"don't worry, sweetheart.  if i'm wrong, i'll recant on my deathbed."
7153,marge,"reverend lovejoy, i had a bit of an ulterior motive in"
7155,homer,god himself told me i should seek a new path.
7157,homer,"yeah.  he appeared before me in a dream, and i knew that"
7159,homer,and <you> remember... matthew ... 21
7161,homer,yeah...    think about it!
7162,marge,"homer, please don't make me choose between my man and my god, because"
7163,homer,"there you go again, always taking someone else's side."
7164,homer,"wait a minute, is this a religious thing?"
7169,homer,"flanders, you saved me!  why?"
7173,homer,"well, the picasso, my collection of classic cars..."
7175,homer, well that's just great!
7184,homer,"i was rude to every one of you, and you saved my life when you could've"
7185,marge,"aw, homer, i'm so glad to hear you say that."
7186,homer,what's the meaning of life?
7188,homer,i can't wait that long!
7198,homer,oh it's no fair!  we'll never have a buffer!
7199,marge,"we have one at home, you never use it."

7203,lisa,fathers have to say that stuff!
7204,homer," dad, am i cute as a bug's ear?"
7207,homer,"moe, have you ever felt unattractive?"
7209,homer," how about you, barney?"
7218,marge,"lisa, i know a song that will cheer you up."
7219,lisa, so you think i'm ugly?!
7220,marge,"noooo.  no, i meant you were one of the good-looking ducks... that"
7221,homer,"hey, nobody's prettier than my little girl!"
7222,marge,"mmmmm, you're looking at her through a father's eyes."
7223,homer,well if i could gouge out somebody else's eyes and shove them into my
7230,lisa, i thought those were illegal?
7233,lisa," uh, isn't this dangerous?"
7235,homer,"when it comes to compliments, "
7237,homer,i'll tell you when you're older.
7238,homer,"is that lisa?  oooo, i gotta call heaven.  "
7240,bart,and the winner is...  lisa simpson!
7242,bart,"okay, wipe away a tear... "
7243,lisa,those other girls are prettier than me.
7244,bart," lis, as your bother, this is the hardest thing i've ever"
7248,lisa," my name is lisa simpson, and i want to be li'l"
7249,homer,"yeah, clean up this stink-hole!"
7255,marge,"oh dear, it'll be a shame if that pretty dress got wet."
7256,lisa,i'd say the greater danger is her sceptre acting as a lighting rod.
7267,lisa,"dad, do you remember why you entered me in that pageant?"
7280,marge,now be good for grampa while we're at the parent-teacher meeting.
7281,lisa,what are we gonna have?
7282,homer,"well, that depends on what your teachers say.  if you've been"
7283,lisa,what if one of us has been good and one of us has been bad?
7285,homer,"oh, no!  i'm not making two stops!"
7287,homer,i'm thinking of a number between one and fifty.
7289,homer,d'oh! ... i mean.... no.
7299,homer,chief justice of the supreme court.  what great men he
7302,homer,"if you don't start making more sense, we're going to have to"
7304,homer,then we'll put you in the crooked home we saw on sixty minutes!
7309,homer,"boy, you're gonna have to be punished for this."
7310,bart,"dad, you <could> punish me, but that means you have to think"
7312,bart,"or... you could let me go play with milhouse, while you"
7313,homer,"hee hee hee.  run along, you little scamp."
7317,marge,do you want your son to become become chief justice of the
7318,homer,"can't he be both, like the late earl warren?"
7319,marge,earl warren wasn't a stripper!
7320,homer,"<now> who's being na\""{\i}ve?"
7326,homer,"bart, didn't i ask you to watch maggie?"
7327,bart,sounds like something you'd say...
7332,homer,"someday you'll thank me for this, son."
7335,homer,"you know, when i was a boy, i really wanted a catcher's mitt,"
7336,bart,"dad, what's the point of this story?"
7342,marge,"homer, i'd like to talk to you."
7343,homer,but then i won't be watching tv!
7345,lisa,he has the demented melancholy of a tennessee williams heroine!
7346,homer,don't you think i know that?
7371,lisa,you'll be just like marie and pierre curie.
7373,lisa,they discovered radium!  then they both died of radiation poisoning.
7377,bart,"i'm halfway through it, i swear!"
7390,homer,i'm used to seeing people promoted ahead of me.
7391,marge,"well, maybe you'd get promoted if you worked a little harder."
7392,homer,are you kidding?  i work like a japanese beaver!
7393,marge,"oh, really?  i came to see you three times today."
7394,homer,well!  i won't sleep in the same bed with a woman who thinks i'm lazy.
7411,marge,that medicine's not for you!
7413,homer,"marge, we're going to that restaurant."
7414,marge,"but i think i'm allergic to seafood.  the last time i ate shrimp,"
7424,marge, you could see our house in that photo!
7426,homer, <my> hammock.  do you understand?
7428,homer,i was wondering if you'd like to babysit my little angels.
7431,homer,"uh, and there was something else...  something i was supposed to"
7433,homer,<that's> it!  woo-hoo!  i'm glad <one> of us remembered.
7435,homer," heh, heh, heh.  i know what you mean."
7439,homer,i hear you loud and clear!
7441,marge,"mmm, what about the bread?  does that have much fish in it?"
7443,homer,this is my quest.  i'm like that guy.  that spanish guy.
7445,homer,"no, that's not it.  what's-his-name, the man of la mancha."
7448,marge,i really think that was the character's name.  don quixote.
7449,homer,fine!  i'll look it up!  
7454,homer,"so, do you think i have a case?"
7458,bart,how can you like that guy?
7462,bart,i'll show <them> who's ``just a kid''!
7463,marge," bart, bedtime!  i laid out your jammy-jams!"
7464,lisa,"good luck in your trumped-up lawsuit, dad."
7465,homer, thanks.  that means a lot to me.
7466,bart,what do you like about him?  he's just a good-looking rebel
7483,homer,  don't tell him you were at a bar!  gasp!  but what else
7484,homer,gasp!  adam west!   kids!  batman!
7485,lisa,"dad, that's not the real batman."
7488,homer,"well, i really should discuss this with my wife."
7490,homer,"what, you think i'm going to buy a $20,000 truck just because you"
7494,marge,i can't believe you bought that plow.  we can't afford it!
7495,homer,"if you're going to get mad at me every time i do something stupid,"
7497,homer,"fine!  i'll never, ever, ever do another stupid thing.  good night!"
7498,marge," oh, homey.  didn't that hurt?"
7517,homer,uh... all of them.  they're having a party.  jimmy carter's
7532,marge," maggie, can you say ba-ba?  can you say mama?"
7535,bart,mister rogers says it all the time!
7537,homer,"maggie, can you say daddy?  daddy?"
7542,homer,"did you hear that?  she said ""burlap""!"
7543,marge,"oh maggie, when are you going to talk?"
7544,lisa,"well, don't push her.  remember, it is better to remain"
7548,marge,"according to fretful mother magazine, if maggie doesn't talk at"
7549,marge,the story of lisa's first word is very cute.
7553,homer,"heh, heh, heh, heh, heh.  homer's what grownups call me.  call me"
7560,bart,"d'omer!  hah, hah, hah..."
7562,marge,then the prince and the princess... got married and lived

7566,marge,hmm...dennis...brad...mavis...brad...
7568,homer,got your nose!  heh heh heh.
7570,marge,there's going to be twice as much love in this house as there is
7571,homer,we're going to start doing it in the morning?!
7572,marge,i'm afraid we're going to need a bigger house.
7573,homer,"no, we won't.  i've got it all figured out.  the baby can have"
7575,homer,my cousin frank did it.
7576,marge,you don't have a cousin frank.
7577,homer,he became francine back in '76.  then he joined that cult.  i
7578,marge,"once we get the cats out of the way, it won't be too bad"
7580,lisa,i wish we lived in the kitty house.
7581,bart,"i could've trained them to be my unholy army of the night.  go, my"
7585,homer,"i need $15,000 to buy a home."
7587,homer,you didn't build this house.  you won it on a crooked 50's game
7590,homer,"dad, first you gave me life, now you've given me a home for my"
7592,bart, so how long before you shipped grampa off to
7596,lisa,when do we get to my first word?
7599,homer,"nah, you don't want to hear that story.  i know.  i'll tell you"
7601,homer,wait a minute.  that was the lucy show.
7603,bart,mom was preggers and dad threw all our money down a sink hole.
7614,homer, and that little while is now eight years and
7615,bart,"i am so great!  i am so great!  everybody loves me, i am so"
7616,marge,"honey, honey, honey, honey, honey.  could you please be quiet?"
7617,bart,quiet!  quiet!  quiet!  quiet!  quiet!  quie --
7619,homer,"it's not easy to juggle a pregnant wife and a troubled child, but"
7630,bart,"can't sleep, clown'll eat me...can't sleep, clown'll eat me..."
7632,marge,"homer, i think the baby is coming."
7633,homer,wow.  a baby and a free burger.  could this be the best day of my
7646,marge,"according to this magazine, bart might be jealous of her ."
7647,homer,"well, bart can kiss my hairy yellow butt."
7649,marge,i saved this newspaper from the day lisa was born.
7651,bart,"""where's the beef?""  what the hell that's supposed to mean?"
7652,homer,"heh heh heh heh heh.  ""where's the beef""...no wonder he won"
7659,bart,can _i_ have a lollipop?
7662,bart,i wanna hold the baby.  i wanna hold the baby.
7663,marge,"i'm sorry, bart, you're too little."
7664,homer,"here, bart, you can hold my beer."
7665,bart,you wrecked everything.  i'm leaving.  goodbye.
7667,bart, what did you say?  say it again!
7669,bart,sufferin' succotash!  you can talk!
7671,bart,can you say david hasselhoff?
7679,lisa,i don't see your name on it!
7681,marge,"bart, don't write on the rug."
7682,homer,"the sooner kids talk, the sooner they talk back."
7690,homer,i can't wait 'till they throw his hatless butt in jail.
7691,marge,"homer, you shouldn't eat so much food.  it's bad for your heart."
7692,homer,"oh, my heart is just fi-- aagh!  "
7695,bart,"hey, lis, i heard that there was a train wreck last night.  wanna"
7697,bart,you're right.  let's bury them at sea.
7699,homer, you know that feeling you get when a thousand knives
7700,marge,"homer, i've made a special surprise just for you!"
7701,homer,it can only be one thing.
7705,homer," ooh, oatmeal, what a delightful treat!  aw, there's a"
7708,bart,"dad, there's a bug on that."
7710,homer,i keep hearing this horrible irregular thumping noise.
7712,homer,"oh, i thought it was my transmission.  "
7746,marge,can't you do something for him?
7748,homer,what an age we live in!
7753,homer,woo hoo!  look at that blubber fly!
7756,homer,"say it in english, doc."
7758,homer,spare me your medical mumbo-jumbo.
7760,homer,could you dumb it down a shade?
7761,marge,"doctor, we'll do whatever it takes to get my homey well."
7766,marge,don't you have a health plan at work?
7767,homer,"we used to, but we gave it up for a pinball machine in the"
7769,homer,"don't worry, marge.  america's health care system is second only"
7771,homer,questions!  questions!  my whole scheme down the --  i
7773,homer,"oh, i thought that said ""brain hemorrhages""."
7775,homer,"now let me tell _you_ something, mr. sucker.  i just--"
7777,homer, ...must...sign...policy!
7783,homer,can i have a free calendar?
7786,homer,"but i don't have $40,000!  maybe i'll just get one of these"
7787,homer,"now i know i haven't been the best christian.  in fact, when"
7788,homer,"now i know i haven't been the best jew, but i have rented"
7791,homer,"no, but the rabbi gave me this.  "
7793,homer,"son, it's called a droodel."
7796,bart,nothing you say can upset us.  we're the mtv generation.
7797,lisa,we feel neither highs or lows.
7798,homer,really?  what's it like?
7800,homer,i'm going to tell the truth and i'm _not_ gonna sugar-coat it.
7801,homer,"kids, kids.  i'm not going to die.  that only happens to bad"
7802,bart,what about abraham lincoln?
7803,homer,he sold poison milk to school children.
7804,homer,what are you in here for?
7806,homer,who are you donating them to?
7817,lisa,my dad is very sick.  what's going to happen if he dies?
7819,homer,"cloud goes up, cloud goes down..."
7823,homer,"well, i could use some laughter right about now."
7832,homer,"barney, i'm not getting a sex change!"
7837,homer,"now marge, if the unthinkable should happen, you're going to be"
7838,marge,"oh homer, i could never remarry."
7839,homer,"darn right.  and to make sure, i want to be stuffed and put on"
7840,homer,"kids, i wanna give you some words to remember me by, if something"
7842,homer,"bart, the saddest thing about this is i'm not going to see you"
7844,homer,"...because i know you gonna turn out well, with or without your"
7848,homer,i guess this is the time to tell you...
7850,homer,...that you're adopted and i don't like you.
7852,homer,"but don't worry, because you've got a big brother who loves you"
7881,lisa, hey!  the incision should be made _below_
7885,bart,you rule intensive care!
7890,lisa,don't you mean <three> million dollars?
7895,marge,i still think we ought to spend the money to fix main street.
7896,homer,"well, you should've written a song like that guy."
7900,homer,"do you want to change your name to homer, junior?"
7901,bart,  i'll get back to you.
7902,marge,"according to this book, the monorail goes over 150 miles an hour!"
7903,homer,``what if.''  what if i stepped in the shower and slipped on a bar
7916,bart,"yeah, but at least we're going to take a lot of innocent people."
7946,marge,but main street's still all cracked and broken...
7947,bart,"sorry, mom, the mob has spoken!"
7954,homer,now what do we say when we get to the ticket booth?
7956,homer,and i'm a college student! heh heh heh.
7957,marge,"kids, i have some bad news. i'm afraid your great-aunt gladys"
7958,bart,"gladys, gladys... big puffy hair, about yea high, big dent in"
7959,marge,no... gladys looked more like your aunt patty.
7960,bart,"  oh yeah, there she is."
7961,marge,the funeral's in littleneck falls. i'm afraid we'll have to
7963,bart,no use complaining about something you can't change.
7964,homer, but i want to go to duff gardens. right now!
7966,homer, i'm not pouting. i'm mourning. stupid dead
7968,homer,"patty, selma, i'm sorry. "

7974,homer," legend of the dog-faced woman! oh, that's"
7979,homer," oh, i thought this thing was going to be catered."
7980,lisa,"good-bye, aunt gladys. i wish i had taken some time to get to"
7984,homer,all in favor of skipping the poem?
8025,bart,can we go to duff gardens this weekend?
8026,homer,sure. unless another aunt dies.
8027,marge,selma! you're back from your date already?
8029,lisa,"aunt selma, this may seem a little presumptious, but have you"
8030,homer, i don't know. you gotta be pretty lame to make it
8036,marge,"""101 frozen pops.""  a nobel prize winner! an nba"
8042,marge,are you sure about this? a baby can really change your life.
8055,homer,i'll give it a good home.
8056,marge,you've been eating that sandwich for over a week. i think the
8057,homer,"two more feet, and i can fit it in the fridge."
8058,marge,"homer, i found this behind the radiator. i really think you"
8060,homer,"marge, i'd like to be alone with the sandwich for a moment."
8061,marge,are you going to eat it?
8064,homer,i don't care. i'm going to duff gardens!
8066,marge,"homey, your lips are turning blue. i think you'd better stay"
8067,homer,"no! duff gardens, hurraaahhh... "
8068,marge,i want to thank you for taking care of the kids on such
8070,bart,"to get to duff gardens, i'd ride with satan himself."
8072,lisa,"bye, dad, don't eat any solids."
8074,bart,"it won't be any fun without you, dad."
8077,lisa, the duff beer-amid contains so much
8080,bart,there's tipsy and queasy...
8081,lisa,there's surly and remorseful...
8089,bart," what did you say, aunt selma?"
8091,marge,"homer, you've cooled down!"
8092,homer,that's what you think! rrowr! 
8093,marge," you know, i rented another movie, in case you felt"
8094,homer,"""the erotic adventures of hercules""."

8105,lisa, i am the lizard queen!
8109,marge, i can't! the beans will burn!
8111,homer,"hi, kids, how was duff gardens?"
8112,lisa,"can't talk, coming down. "
8114,homer,"you take an ordinary bedsheet, fold it around like th--"
8120,marge,he called you a bad father.
8121,homer,"marge, when kids these days say `bad', they mean `good'."
8122,marge,"homer, do you have an explanation for this bill?"
8123,homer,"oh, it's that record club.  the first nine were only a penny."
8124,marge,"why didn't you ask our permission, lisa?"
8137,bart,"someday, i want to be an f-14 pilot like my hero tom.  he lent"
8139,bart,"naah, but i wouldn't give him any homework for a while."
8141,bart,"oh, don't thank me.  thank an unprecedented eight-year military build-up."
8142,homer,"hey, boy.  where ya goin'?"
8144,homer,have a good time! ... wait a minute...
8147,bart,"you've been really great to me, but there's probably some other"
8153,homer,"son, i just want you to know i love you very much."
8158,homer,"well, there's... jerry the cowboy.  and that big dipper looking"
8160,homer,"heh heh heh.  `learn'd', son.  it's pronounced `learn'd'."
8162,homer,"i love you, too, pepsi."
8166,homer,remember when i used to push you on the swing?
8169,bart,"oh yeah?  remember this?  ``higher, dad!  higher!  whee!''"
8170,bart,"dad, remember when tom had you in that headlock and you"
8172,bart,could you teach me how to do that?
8179,marge,"and this is for my huggy-bug, in honor of this special day."
8180,homer,"  special day!?  oh, what have i forgot now?"
8182,homer, she's getting impatient!  take a stab at it!
8183,marge,"  (*squeak*) (*squeak*)  aw, thank you, dear."
8189,lisa,isn't that just pointless busy-work?
8195,bart,i'd do anything to go to that show!
8196,homer,i'd sell my first-born son!
8198,homer,you'll do as you're told!
8199,lisa,what do you say to a boy to let him know you're not interested?
8201,homer," let me handle this, marge, i've heard 'em all."
8203,homer, ``i'm married to the sea.''  ``i don't
8206,lisa,just make up some excuse!  
8207,homer,  she's in the can.  go away.
8209,lisa,i'm not sure if i <should> go.  i don't even like him.
8210,bart,"you're right, lis, you shouldn't go.  it wouldn't be honest."
8211,lisa,but what if he wants to hold hands?
8212,bart,i'm prepared to make that sacrifice.
8213,lisa,what if he wants to kiss?
8214,bart,i'm prepared to make that sacrifice.
8216,bart,you don't want to know how far i'll go.
8217,lisa,"dad, is it all right to take things from people you don't like?"
8218,homer,"sure it is, honey.  you <do> mean stealing, don't you?"
8219,lisa,my conscience is bothering me.
8220,homer,"your conscience!?  lisa, don't let that pushy little weenie"
8224,lisa,that story isn't suitable for children.
8227,homer,"you know, one day, honest citizens are gonna stand up to you"
8237,lisa, first prize! first prize! first prize!
8238,bart,why are you saying that?
8239,lisa,just screwing with your mind.  
8240,marge," homer, i want you to encourage"
8243,bart,the kind that help our olympic athletes reach new peaks of
8245,homer,"well, time to go to work."
8247,homer,"roll in at nine, punch out at five, that's the plan."
8249,homer,then to the duff brewery.
8251,homer, i've got to think of a lie fast!
8252,marge,"homer, are you going to the duff brewery?"
8256,lisa,"oh bart, i forgot my math book.  could you hold this for me,"
8257,bart," why, sointantly!  nyuk, nyuk, nyuk."
8278,lisa,"oh, uh ... i was just thinking of a joke i saw on herman's head."
8279,homer,"{mmmmm, gummi beers.}   hey, barney, i think you've"
8281,homer,"barney, give me your keys.  you're too drunk to drive."
8283,homer,"ok, you leave me no option.  "
8285,homer,i'm trying to knock you out.
8299,marge,"oh, my god!  he's dead?"
8306,homer,"your honor, i'd like that stricken from the record."
8308,lisa,i want the most intelligent hamster you've got.
8310,lisa,how can a hamster write mysteries?
8314,lisa, i propose to determine the answer to the question
8315,bart,"hey lis, look what i can do!"
8320,homer,i'm here for the alc-anon meeting.
8332,homer,...so they say i might have a problem.
8334,homer,does the lord count as a person?
8337,marge,do you need a beer to fall asleep?
8338,homer,"thank you, that'd be nice."
8339,marge,do you ever hide beer around the house?
8341,marge,do you ever drink to escape from reality.
8343,marge,"homey, i'd like you to do something for me."
8345,marge,i want you to give up beer for a month.

9525,homer, my wife is having a girls' night out.
9529,marge,"ruth, is there something you want to tell me?"
9533,marge,didn't you realize all you had to do was report him to the
9536,homer,a lot of blue hair?  hee hee -- what a freak!
9537,homer,...it's marge!  she's become a crazed criminal just because i
9540,marge,"i don't want to be a wet blanket, but maybe you should give"
9542,marge, i should say something reassuring and noncommittal.
9544,marge,"well, i don't think they'll be that easy to lose.  these are"
9550,marge,yeah...everything before the high-speed chase was just lovely.
9561,bart,"hey, it's morning and mom and dad aren't home yet."
9562,lisa,"don't worry, mr. hutz is still here to take care of us.  [taps"
9569,lisa,i always knew someday mom would violently rise up and cast off the
9572,marge,"ruth, that's a lot of hooey.  it's not over 'till it's over."
9575,homer,oh my god!  they're going to drive right into it just to teach
9578,homer,"look marge, i'm sorry i haven't been a better husband.  i'm sorry"
9581,homer,it's solid waste...i could kiss you!
9589,homer,tramapoline!  trampopoline!  
9591,marge,"please, don't bring home any more old crutches!"
9594,homer,yeah.  what's the deal?
9598,bart,i will _never_ get tired of this!
9599,lisa,i'm going to have my wedding here!
9600,marge,i don't know if this is a good idea.
9601,homer,"marge, it's the perfect exercise!  it'll double the value of our"
9613,homer,"that's the last i'll see of mr. trampoline.  yep, it's finally"
9614,bart,"{dad, you really want to get rid of this trampoline?}"
9622,homer,"ok, the trampoline was a bad idea.  but you know what?  at least"
9624,homer,name one thing you've done in the past month that was fun.
9625,marge,i can name ten things!  uh...i made sloppy joes!
9628,marge,hmm...i didn't realize people saw me that way.
9630,marge,"no, i'm fine.  i'm going to my sisters' now."
9645,marge,that video really opened my eyes.  i can see that i'm just a
9646,homer,and that sends me into a shame spiral.
9648,marge,"homer, did you eat my whole pan of brownies?"
9649,bart,"uh oh.  you're in for it now, dad."
9650,homer,"marge, i'm feeling a lot of shame right now."
9651,marge,i'm hearing that you feel a lot of shame.
9652,homer,and i feel that you hear my shame.
9653,marge,"i'm feeling annoyance and frustration, but also tolerance."
9654,homer,i feel validated by that.
9655,marge,good!  i'm glad we had this talk.
9657,homer,"well, here we are at the brad goodman lecture."
9659,homer,"i just thought i'd remind everybody.  after all, we did agree to"
9660,bart,what an odd thing to say...
9704,lisa,this is madness.  he's just peddling a bunch of easy answers.
9708,lisa,is that why you're sitting on an ice cream sandwich?
9716,bart,"lis, everyone in town is acting like me.  so why does it suck?"
9719,lisa,"ever since that self-help guy came to town, you've lost your"
9721,lisa,"well, this is your chance to develop a new and better identity."
9722,bart,"sounds good, sis.  just tell me what to do."
9735,homer,"this is great...i can finally look like i want, and not get"
9737,bart,skateboards?  you copycat wannabes!
9742,homer,"hey, i hear you, buddy."
9743,marge,"er, i don't want to judge the rightness of your ego orientation,"
9754,marge,i knew it.  if only i had nagged more!
9761,marge,that's not fair.  the lesson here is that self-improvement is
9762,lisa,"no!  self-improvement can be achieved, but not with a quick fix"
9763,homer,that's what i've been saying!  we're all fine the way we are!
9764,homer,ooh!  it's that new show about the policeman who solves
9772,homer," it means he gets results, you stupid chief!"
9778,bart,"be cool, simpson...but be _in_ the game, not _of_ the game."
9784,bart,"oh, man, how are we supposed to kill the rest of the afternoon?"
9793,bart,"ok, we're young, rich, and full of sugar.  what do we do?"
9796,bart,"springfield, springfield!"
9799,bart,"new york is that-a-way, man!"
9805,lisa,"tsk, tsk, tsk, the remorse of the sugar junkie."
9806,bart,ohh...i don't remember anything.
9807,lisa,really?  not even...this?  
9808,bart,"aah!  oh, no!  i must have joined the junior campers."
9809,lisa,"the few, the proud, the geeky.  "
9810,bart,"boy, a man on a squishy bender can sure do some crazy things."
9815,marge,"i know you think the junior campers are square and ""uncool"", but"
9816,homer,"marge, don't discourage the boy.  weaseling out of things is"
9817,bart,all i've got to do is take this uniform back after school.
9826,bart," oh, no.  woe is me.  my precious uniform."
9833,bart," um, mrs. krabappel, i-i'd love"
9838,bart,"hello, alternative to testing!"
9845,bart,huh?   you guys get to play with knives?  [grabs one of
9853,homer," well, if it isn't the leader of the wiener patrol,"
9854,marge,"homer, you should be more supportive."
9855,homer,"you're right, marge.  good work, boy.  "
9864,bart,"{you knowdely-know it, neddy.}"
9867,bart," oh no, me bring homer on a rafting trip?"
9868,homer,"duh, i'm the captain.  my son is bart.  [splashes everyone"
9876,homer,"how was jerk practice, boy?  did they teach you how to sing to"
9877,bart,"actually, we were just planning the father-son river rafting"
9878,homer,"heh heh, you don't have a son."
9879,bart," look, homer won't want to go, so just ask"
9880,homer," i don't want to go, so if he asks me to go,"
9882,homer,"shut up, brain, or i'll stab you with a q-tip!"
9883,bart," dad, i really want you to come"
9884,homer," bart, i'd be delighted to go on"
9891,homer,"please not flanders, please not flanders, please not flanders --"
9897,homer,"um, i dunno...but lucky for you _somebody_ here is responsible."
9900,homer," sugar, do-do-do do, do do,"
9902,homer,now i have to face stupid reality again.
9903,homer,flanders!  my socks feel dirty.  give me some water to wash
9905,homer,"oh, pardon me, mr. ""let's ration everything"", but what d'you"
9906,homer,"oh, what does it matter, we're doomed!"
9908,homer," woo-hoo!  see that, boy?  your old man was right,"
9912,bart,a rescue plane!  get the flare gun!
9913,homer,"this ain't one of your church picnic flare-gun firings, flanders!"
9917,homer,{ flanders!  snap out of it!
9919,bart,"{ dad, i think he's ok --}"
9922,homer,"son, there was something i was going to give you at the end of"
9923,bart, a real swiss army knife!  cool!
9924,homer,i stole it from that borgnine guy.
9926,homer,"according to this map, there's a krusty burger on an offshore"
9928,homer,"never mind the fog!   that way!  steer, there isn't"
9932,homer, give me seven hundred krusty burgers!
9936,bart,"the beauty of it is, each parking space is a mere one foot"
9946,bart," oh, i couldn't read it.  the letters are all blurry."
9948,bart," ya mean it ain't me noggin, it's me"
9972,homer,and we won't be able to pee in the drinking fountain...
9982,homer, so...what do you guys think of mindy?
9984,homer, yeah...that mindy seems real nice.
9987,homer, mindy has a motorcycle.
9988,homer,"moe, i need your advice."

10001,homer," d'oh!  ok, so we have one thing in common.  but you"
10005,homer,foul temptress.  i'll bet she thinks ziggy's gotten too preachy
10006,homer,whew!  i made it the whole day without seeing her again.
10008,homer,that's ok.  i'll just push the button for the stimulator -- i

10011,marge,"hi hober.  don't kiss be, i'b all stuffed ub."

10037,homer,ooh!  i would live in a big mansion?
10039,homer,"i, as well.  are you happy, jeeves?"
10054,lisa,"dad, why are you singing?"
10055,homer," tell a lie, tell a lie."
10056,lisa,are you hiding something from me?
10058,lisa,"judging from your song, you're infatuated with a woman named"
10059,homer," lisa, look out behind you!"
10060,lisa," dad, i'm not gonna fall for that."
10061,homer,"no, lisa, i swear to you"
10064,homer," ""mindy, because of our uncontrollable"
10068,homer,"mindy!  [clears throat, glances at prepared speech on his hand"
10076,homer,"oh, this is the worst crisis my marriage has ever faced!"
10078,homer,heh heh.  did you know kinch had a radio in the coffee pot?
10082,homer,stop that!  i love my wife and family.  all i'm gonna use this
10084,homer,"yeah.  uh, walls are a necessity in today's society, heh."
10086,homer,"oh, mindy...we have to fight our temptation."
10092,homer,"oh, something's missing...ooh!  one of the turkeys fell behind"
10105,homer,"you know, i was a little worried about coming to this convention"
10109,homer,is there any way to get out of this?
10113,homer," ""you will find happiness with a new love."""
10116,homer," well, i guess you'll want to come in."
10122,homer,"oh, yeah, like you don't know.   we're gonna have sex!"
10124,homer, yes we do!  the cookie told me so.
10128,homer,"well, maybe i want to...but then i think about marge and the"
10131,marge,"this was a _wonderful_ idea, homey.   hey, there's a"
10146,homer,anyone lose their glasses?  
10157,lisa,"dad, you shouldn't wear glasses that weren't prescribed for you."
10158,homer," lisa, just because you're ten feet tall doesn't mean"
10169,lisa,"excuse me, mr. mayor --"
10171,lisa,this piggy bank contains fifteen dollars i've saved from my
10186,marge,"actually, i think it might really help our economy."
10189,marge,this could be a whole new beginning for springfield.
10190,homer,and you know what the best part is?  we've really done something
10207,lisa,"mom, we're having a geography pageant at school, and i don't know"
10208,marge,"in honor of legalized gambling, why not go as the state of"
10210,marge,"then how about going as florida?  you enjoy orange juice, old"
10211,lisa,"dad, what do _you_ think?"
10212,homer,shh!  i'm trying to teach the baby to gamble.
10214,homer,"i got a job at burns' casino.  as you know, it's been my lifelong"
10215,marge,"your lifelong dream was to be a contestant on ""the gong show"","
10216,homer,we got more gongs than the break-dancing robot that caught on
10224,homer,"why thanks, senator!  oh -- looks like my shift is over."
10235,bart,"by the way, your martinis suck!"
10237,bart,"hi, yeah, welcome.  have a lucky day.  mm hmm."
10241,homer,"oh, sorry.  here's another one."
10247,homer,"hey marge, after your big tantrum against legalized gambling, i"
10249,homer,"strike three, marge!  i remember that meeting and i have a"
10250,marge,legalized gambling is a bad idea.  you can build a casino over my
10256,homer,{twenty-one?  do that card counting thing again.  come on
10258,homer,"{no!  please, please, please, please, please?}"
10289,homer,marge!  you waited for me.
10293,homer,"marge, i'm taking the car."
10295,homer,this late?  through the bad neighborhood?
10298,marge,go home!  you're bad luck.
10299,homer,wait!  i see what's happening here.  you're just mad because
10306,lisa,"do you get the feeling this family is disintegrating?  i mean, we"
10307,bart,"pipe down, sister.  i gotta book a new act for tonight.  turns out"
10308,lisa,there's nothing to eat for breakfast.
10309,homer,"you gotta improvise, lisa"
10310,lisa,maybe mom just doesn't realize we missed her.  we could go down
10311,homer,"oh, come on, lisa, there's no reason to --  --"
10312,homer,"marge, we need to talk.  you're spending too much time at the"
10313,marge,i won sixty dollars last night!
10314,homer,woo-hoo!  problem solved.
10319,homer,huh -- wha -- lisa!  what's up?
10320,lisa,i just had a bad dream!
10321,homer,"oh, sure.  you just lie down and tell me all about it."
10322,lisa,"well, i know it's absurd, but i dreamed the bogeyman was after"
10323,homer,"aah!  bogeyman!  you nail the windows shut, i'll get the gun!"
10326,homer,"oh, nothing, marge.  just a little incident involving the"
10327,marge,i'm sorry.  i _have_ been spending too much time at the casino.
10328,lisa,does this mean you'll help me with my costume?
10329,marge,"sure, honey.  i promise."
10340,lisa,"dad, mom said she'd be home to help me with my costume and she's"
10341,homer,"lisa, your mom still loves you.  it's just that she has a career"
10342,lisa,"but dad, if i don't show up in a rubber suit shaped like the"
10343,homer," oh, it's always _something_, isn't it?  first i have"
10346,homer," no, lisa.  the only monster here is the"

10357,marge,"homer, what is it?  slow down!"
10358,homer, j'yer gedda ferda redderarrar.
10359,marge,think before you say each word.
10360,homer,you broke a promise to your child.
10362,homer,you promised lisa to help her with her costume.  you made her
10363,homer,"marge, i want you to admit you have a gambling problem."
10364,marge,"you know, you're right, homer.  maybe i should get some"
10365,homer,"no, no, that's too expensive.  just don't do it any more."
10370,homer,"you know, marge, for the first time in our marriage i can finally"
10371,marge,that's true.  will you forgive me?
10372,homer,"oh, sure.  remember when i got caught stealing all those watches"
10374,homer,"well, that's nothing, because _you_ have a gambling problem!  and"
10376,homer,well _you_ have a gambling problem!
10377,marge,"homer, when you forgive someone, you can't throw it back at them"
10381,homer,"oh, yeah; i forgot already."
10385,bart,dad...we've been robbed!
10386,lisa,"wake up, dad, wake up!  there was a burglar and he took my"
10391,homer,"ehh, that's no big loss."
10392,marge,"homer, that necklace was a priceless bouvier family heirloom."
10393,homer,"oh, you've probably got a whole drawer full of 'em."
10394,marge,"well, yes i do.  but they're all heirlooms too."
10395,bart, the burglar even took my stamp collection.
10396,lisa,_you_ had a stamp collection?
10398,lisa,"bart's pain is funny, but mine isn't.  that saxophone was my one"
10402,homer,can't talk.  robbed.  go hell.
10404,bart,"wow, it's a crime wave!"
10405,lisa,"{we _are_ insured, aren't we, mom?}"
10406,marge,"{homer, tell your child what you bought when i sent you to town"
10407,homer,"{curse you, magic beans!}"
10408,marge,"{oh, stop blaming the beans.}"
10409,homer,"hello, police?  are you sitting down?  good!  i wish to report a"
10425,marge,and don't take candy from strangers.
10426,homer," marge, they're only human!"
10427,lisa,what's the point of all these precautions?  i've already lost the
10428,homer,"oh, lisa, stop pining for your saxophone.  i got you another"
10430,homer,"lisa, never _ever_ stop in the middle of a hoedown!"
10440,homer,we don't need a thinker.  we need a doer
10449,homer,"hmm...sorry, dad.  you're too old."
10452,homer,"aw, dad.  you've done a lot of great things, but you're a"
10454,marge,i don't think the guns are a good idea.
10455,homer,marge!  we're responsible adults.  and --
10457,homer,and if a group of responsible adults can't handle firearms
10463,homer,"{ok, we've got the secret vigilante handshake.  now we need code"
10466,homer,"no, we're forming a vigilante group."
10469,homer,put this in your pipe and smoke it!
10473,homer,"ok, men, it's time to clean up this town!"
10475,homer,"you know, push people around, make ourselves feel big."
10476,homer,"hey, you!  where did you get that saxophone?"
10479,homer,"you better have a good reason for doing that, boy."
10481,homer,let me check my reason list.  ...yep!  it's on here.
10483,homer, i don't know...can you swing a sack of door knobs?
10485,homer,you're in!  here's the sack.
10487,homer,"so i said to him, ""look, buddy, your car was upside down when we"
10488,lisa,"dad, don't you see you're abusing your power like all vigilantes?"
10490,marge,"homer, wasn't the whole point to catch the cat burglar?"
10491,lisa,and i still don't have my saxophone.
10492,homer,"lisa, the mob is working on getting your saxophone back.  but"
10494,homer,"oh ho, heh, that might be a typo."
10497,homer,"aw, people can come up with statistics to prove anything, kent."
10499,homer," oh, kent, i'd be lying if i said my men weren't"
10508,homer,why you monster.  and you have my daughter's saxophone too!
10510,homer,"oh...heh, sorry.  i'm a little nervous."
10512,homer,"listen, mr. cat burglar, i vow to go without sleep and guard the"
10515,homer," dad, the best way for you to help is to set a good"
10525,homer,"""asleep at the switch""?  i wasn't asleep, i was drunk!"
10529,lisa,dad...maybe this will cheer you up.  
10530,homer,"aw, this doesn't work any more.   i didn't say stop!"
10533,lisa,"oh, grampa, they pelted you too?"
10542,lisa,"wow!  how'd you track him down, grampa?"
10544,homer,"aw, dad, i could kiss you!"
10548,homer,"so, mr. malloy, it seems that the cat has been caught by the"
10551,homer,"actually, it wasn't me, it was my dad, grampa."
10559,lisa,"thank you.  and thank you, dad.  you got it back -- just like"
10568,homer,i caught the cat burglar!  i caught the cat burglar!  that means
10575,homer," well...i guess i'll be going to my home now,"
10583,homer,"it's mine!   ""frightfully sorry, but there is no hidden"
10591,homer,"yeah.  you kids gotta go to school, i gotta go to work; the only"
10592,bart,"we're having a field trip today!  ah, lis, won't it be great to"
10595,bart, sounds like another pulitzer
10599,lisa, why?  i'm so much happier here.
10606,bart,"damn tv, you've ruined my imagination, just like you've ruined"
10617,bart,have any of the workers ever had their hands cut off by the
10619,bart,and then the hand started crawling around and tried to
10644,homer," whaddaya mean, you lost him?  he might have fallen"
10648,bart,"here's a danish, krusty!"
10650,bart,i stole it from kent brockman.
10654,bart,i'm bart simpson.  i saved you from jail.
10656,bart,i reunited you with your estranged father.
10658,bart,"i saved your career, man!  remember your comeback special?"
10671,bart,"hey, that's my lucky red hat sitting on top of a double-"
10672,marge,"oh, it sounds like you really learned something on your field"
10673,bart,"well, that'll always be the dream..."
10674,marge,"hmm, i don't know, bart.  you're only ten."
10675,lisa,i've got a weekend job helping the poor and i'm only eight.
10676,homer," that's not a job, it's a waste of time.  what can poor"
10678,bart,"can i, mom?  can i take the job?"
10680,homer,why not?  i remember my first after school job.  i was in a
10684,bart,"dad, i'm asking if i can get a job."
10685,homer," gig, son.  when you're a musician, a job is"
10686,bart,wow.  bein' in show business is like a dream.  we're really
10690,bart,"i'm telling you, i _do_ work on the krusty show.  look at the"
10693,bart," there's my name, right there"
10697,homer,"it's ok, son.  who cares what a bunch of fourth-graders think?"
10698,bart," thanks, dad.  that's great advice."
10699,homer,"yep, well, that's what got me where i am today."
10711,bart,you want me to be on the show?
10715,bart,"""i am waiting for a bus."""
10726,lisa,this biography of bart came out awfully quickly.  it's not even
10727,bart,sure it is!  look at the cover.
10728,lisa,"but inside it's mostly about ross perot, and the last two"
10729,homer,"ah, oliver north.  he was just _poured_ into that uniform."
10736,bart,"uh...i never thought i'd say this, but shouldn't we be"
10740,homer,"come on, lisa, say something funny."
10742,homer,"oh, something stupid like bart would say.  ""bucka bucka"" or"
10744,lisa,"forget it, dad.  if i ever become famous, i want it to be for"
10746,homer,"aw, don't worry, son.  you know, they said the same thing about"
10747,homer,what the hell are you reading books for?
10748,bart,"i'm doing ""the conan o'brien show"", and i want to have some"
10749,homer,"don't forget to say ""i didn't do it."""
10750,bart,"dad, there's more to me than just a catch-phrase."
10751,homer,"how do you figure, boy?"
10752,bart,"watch ""the conan o'brien show"", you'll see."
10753,homer,"all right, but after leno i'm all laughed out, you know."
10754,bart,"you know, conan, i have a lot to say.  i'm not just a one-line"
10759,bart,"""just do the line"", ""just do the line""...what's going to"
10772,marge, bart?  it's time to get ready for the show.
10775,marge,"honey, i know you feel a little silly saying the same four words"
10776,bart,"you're right, mom.  i shouldn't let this bother me.  i'm in"
10777,marge,the _best_ performance of your life?
10778,bart,the _best_ performance of my life!
10787,bart,"boy.  show business is kind of cruel, isn't it?"
10790,lisa,"and now you can go back to just being you, instead of a one-"
10799,lisa," if anyone wants me, i'll be in my room."
10809,homer,"woo hoo!  cheap meat!   ooh, this one's open."
10812,homer,your old meat made me sick!
10814,homer, this shrimp isn't frozen!  and it
10817,homer,"oh, rancid meat attack!  stupid parasites.  is there no way i can"
10820,lisa,"dad, you should blow the whistle on the kwik-e-mart."
10822,lisa,"dad, are you listening to me?"
10825,homer,"no way, man.  no way, man!  get yourself another patsy, man.  no"
10832,homer,"don't be alarmed, apu.  just go about your daily routine like i'm"
10859,homer,"ah ha ha, it's true, it's true!  we're so lame!"
10861,homer,"no, don't kill me.  i didn't know there was film in that camera"
10866,homer,"you're...selling _what_, now?"
10868,homer,you can't sell that!  karma can only be portioned out by the
10870,homer, is he still out there?
10871,marge,yes.  he's raking leaves?
10872,homer,what?  that's _your_ job.  if he starts doing lisa's wood
10873,marge,if he wants to make it up to you so badly i think you should let
10874,homer,"ok, ok, i'll let him.  but then i get a chipwich, ok?"
10877,lisa, i can see through time!
10878,homer, stop being such babies.  you can't be afraid
10880,homer,ha ha ha ha!  outrageous!
10883,bart,this movie you rented sucks.
10884,homer,"no it doesn't, it's funny!  their clothes are different from my"
10903,homer,{ er...i...like to keep a lollipop there.}
10904,marge,"hmm.  apu, we usually store our cans in the cupboard."
10906,lisa,"mmm, corn!  haven't had that in a while."
10908,marge," oh, we're low on milk for maggie.  you want"
10910,marge,"ooh, that's a _great_ price for twelve pounds of nutmeg."
10918,marge,but that's the longest.
10927,marge,"apu, you've been so helpful.  if it weren't for him, we'd still"
10928,lisa,and he taught me how to play the sheh'nai.  [plays a snake-
10929,homer, that's even worse than the album grampa released.
10930,bart,and he taught me how to do this.  [puts both legs behind his
10932,homer,"well, you deserve it.  all these vegetables are really clearing"
10936,marge,"their floors are stick-e-mart,"
10937,lisa,"they make dad sick-e-mart,"
10938,bart,"let's hurl a brick-e-mart,"
10939,homer,the kwik-e-mart is real...
10943,homer,"everything _really_ wrapped up nicely.   ooh,"
10944,marge,i guess we've learned that happiness is wherever you find it.
10945,homer,"and we've _all_ found happiness, every one of us."
10947,homer,"{hey, he's not happy at all.  he lied to us through song.  i"
10950,lisa,isn't there _anything_ you can do to get your job back?
10952,homer,i'm coming with you.  i got you fired; it's the least i can do.
10955,lisa,"dad, that's over ten thousand miles away."
10957,lisa,that's over sixteen thousand kilometers!
10969,homer,this isn't very convenient.
10974,homer,are you _really_ the head of the kwik-e-mart?
10984,homer,"well, _that_ was a big bust.  is he _really_ the head of the"
10986,homer,"no need to apologize, apu"
10991,homer,"fine!   oh, i mean not good."
10992,lisa,"i'm sorry, apu.  but remember,  ""who needs the kwik-e-"
10995,marge,"oh, that'll work out great!  we're out of lucky charms."
11008,marge,that sounds like a good movie.
11010,homer,"hey, let's all hug apu."
11021,lisa,"thanks.   ""mr. simpson stop your calls and letters are"
11027,homer,"dad, we'd love to stay here and listen to your amusing antidote,"
11030,homer,"look, maggie!  it's sergeant thug's mountaintop command post!"
11031,marge,mmm...that toy isn't safe for a baby like maggie!
11032,homer,"aw, come on, marge, you're way too -- "
11037,marge,"oh, i understand, honey.  when i was your age, there was a --"
11038,lisa," hey, horse-face!  get your ugly hooks off"
11047,bart,"[plays with sergeant thug's mountaintop command post, making plane"
11050,lisa,"thanks for buying us these toys, grampa."
11058,lisa,a hush falls over the general assembly as stacy approaches the
11062,lisa,"come on, stacy.  i've waited my whole life to hear you speak."
11064,bart,"right on!  say it, sister."
11065,lisa,"it's not funny, bart.  millions of girls will grow up thinking"
11066,bart, just what i was going to say.
11069,lisa, don't you people see anything wrong what malibu stacy
11072,lisa,"no, celeste.  i mean, the things she says are sexist."
11074,lisa,they _cannot_ keep making dolls like this...something has to be
11075,marge,"lisa, ordinarily i'd say you should stand up for what you believe"
11076,bart,yeah.  you made us march in that gay rights parade!
11077,homer,and we can't watch fox because they own those chemical weapon
11078,lisa,i can't believe you're just going to stand by as your daughters
11079,marge,i had a malibu stacy when i was little and i turned out all
11082,lisa,mom!  we could go on the factory tour and i could complain in
11083,marge,"honey, you're not going to throw red paint at the executives, are"
11096,lisa,is the remarkably sexist drivel spouted by malibu stacy
11101,lisa,it's awful being a kid.  no one listens to you.
11103,homer,"{i'm a white male, age 18 to 49.  everyone listens to me -- no"
11104,lisa,well i'm not going to accomplish anything just sitting here --
11106,lisa,-- action!  i've got to talk to that woman who invented malibu
11111,lisa,i thought you might be able to help me get in touch with the
11116,lisa,"excuse me, miss lavelle?  i'd like to talk to you about malibu"
11120,lisa,i want you to hear what malibu stacy is telling a generation of
11126,lisa,change what she says.  it's your company.
11132,lisa,"but if you can learn from malibu stacy's mistakes, so can"
11135,lisa,"uh, i'll come back tomorrow."
11139,lisa,make sure you get my mom's hair just right!
11150,lisa,"""when i get married, i'm keeping my own name.""  oh, no, that"
11158,lisa,all right.  now all we need is a name.
11159,bart,"how about blabbermouth, the jerky doll for jerks?"
11160,lisa,"how about minerva, after the roman goddess of wisdom?"
11162,bart,wendy windbag?  ugly doris?  hortense the mule-faced doll!
11164,bart,"no, loudmouth lisa!  stupid lisa grabage face!  [no one pays"
11165,lisa,this is great.  they're really going to sell our doll!
11171,lisa,"dad, did you hear something?"
11187,lisa," well, i guess you can't beat big business.  there's just"
11188,lisa," trust in yourself, and you can achieve anything!"
11189,lisa,"you know, if we get through to just that one little girl, it'll"
11198,homer,"hello!  well, today's the day for homer j.!  i _know_ i'm going"
11200,homer,"union rule 26.  ""every employee must win 'worker of the week' at"
11203,homer," ooh...inanimate, huh?  i'll show him inanimate!"
11204,homer,stupid carbon rod.  it's all just a popularity contest!
11205,bart,wow!  did you actually get to _see_ the rod?
11207,homer, nobody respects me at work.
11209,homer,"ah, tv respects me.  it laughs _with_ me, not at me!"
11220,bart,"oh no, not another boring space launch.  change the channel."
11243,homer,shut up!  and another thing
11245,homer,"hello, is this president clinton?  good!  i figured if anyone"
11249,homer,"no, it wasn't me, i swear!  it was...him!  "
11253,homer, respect?  nooo!  it was me.  _i_ made the crank call.
11265,homer,i'll field this one.  the only danger is if they send us to
11271,homer,and may the best man win.   he's got a
11272,bart,"wow, my father an astronaut.  i feel so full of...what's the"
11274,bart,"no, not _that_ far from shame."
11277,marge,"you know, homer, when i found out about this, i went through a"
11279,homer,"well, here i am, right on time.  i don't see barney ""let's"
11283,homer,"oh, that's nothing.  watch this"
11287,homer," i, er, don't think this contest is over yet,"
11289,homer, you mean i shaved my bikini zone for nothing?!
11291,homer," congratulations, barney."
11295,homer,default?  woo hoo!  the two sweetest words in the english
11302,homer,marge...i don't really want to go through with this.  but being
11303,marge,"homer, when i met you, you weren't an astronaut.  you didn't even"
11304,marge,"but on the other hand, when you don't take advantage of an"
11305,homer,"you're right, marge.  just like the time i could have met mr. t"
11306,marge,"oh, i am so proud of you.  and i know it's going to go just fine"
11308,homer,are we there yet?  i'm thirsty.
11318,lisa,"""how doth the hero strong and brave,"
11335,homer,"wow, former president james taylor."
11343,marge,"mmm, don't worry, kids.  i'm sure your father's all right."
11344,lisa,"what are you basing that on, mom?"
11345,marge, who wants ginger snaps?
11352,homer,"wait a minute, race.  wait a minute...wait!"
11354,homer,oh.   i'll bash you good!
11355,lisa,"come on, dad.  you can make it!"
11363,bart,"aw, they were just about to show some close-ups of the rod!"
11364,homer,"oh, stupid rod!  i got gypped."
11365,marge,"oh, homey, you should be proud!  only a handful of people have"
11366,lisa,"yeah, dad!  how many people have seen the icecaps and the deserts"
11367,homer,"yeah, maybe i do have the right...what's that stuff?"
11373,homer,"see?  because of me, now they have a warning."
11374,bart," hey dad, sell you these for fifty bucks..."
11376,marge," those aren't tickets to the game, homer."
11377,homer,what do you mean?  it says right here
11378,homer,"heh heh heh, i did it!  second in line, and all i had to do was"
11380,homer,"in theory, yes.   jerk."
11386,homer,get tickets.  must get tickets!  find phone.  yes!
11391,homer,"oh, not flanders, anybody but flanders --"
11394,homer,why am i such a loser?  why?
11395,bart,"well, your father was a loser, and _his_ father, and his"
11396,lisa,what's so special about this game anyway?  it's just another
11397,homer,"heh heh heh.  yeah, they swore they'd get us back by spiking"
11401,homer,"god, if you really are god, you'll get me tickets to that game."
11403,homer," why do you mock me, o lord?"
11404,marge,"homer, that's not god.  that's just a waffle that bart tossed up"
11405,homer,"i know i shouldn't eat thee, but --  mmm, sacrilicious."
11408,marge,are you planning to hit ned flanders with that pipe and take his
11411,homer,"oh.   flanders, i decided i'd like to go to the game"
11414,homer, duck!  i can't let the boys see me with you!
11421,homer,"well, i guess i should pay my share."
11423,homer,"ooh, you brought me a nacho hat!  thanks, ned."
11425,homer,"if anyone can pull it off, it's stan ""the boy"" taylor."
11427,homer,hey!  somebody sign an autograph?  please?  somebody...sign an
11432,homer,"professional athletes, always wantin' more."
11437,homer,wow.  now i have four children.   you will be called
11439,homer,no!  i want everyone to know that --  this is ned
11443,marge,"homer, that's our wedding photo!"
11444,homer,"marge, quit living in the past."
11446,homer,"i'll be there.  and this time, _you_ can be the nacho man."
11447,lisa,"dad and ned flanders next?  hmph.  what's next, a's on bart's"
11450,homer,"watch this, ned.  they don't call me ""springfield fats"" just"
11455,homer,boring!  let's watch something else.
11462,homer,"aw, uncle homer.  ned, since you've let me spend time with"
11464,homer,"i'd like to introduce ned flanders, my best friend."
11468,marge,"honey, i'm so glad you're ho --"
11469,homer,"can't talk, seeing flanders.  later, sex."
11472,homer,"hiya.  flanders.  ooh, dinner!  may i join you?  "
11474,homer,"oh yeah, the judge made me do that once too.  stupid lack of"
11475,homer,come on!  we've been here for fifteen minutes!  can't you see
11477,homer,"aw, for some reason, moe's always closed on wednesdays"
11480,marge,"homey, i'm very proud of you, but don't you think you're spending"
11481,homer,"oh, of _course_ you'd say something like that, marge.  you've"
11483,homer,"love, marge.  don't hate -- love."
11484,bart,"the flanders are a bunch of geeks, man."
11485,homer,"the flandereses are not geeks!  -- ok, rod and todd are, and the"
11488,lisa,"don't worry, bart.  it seems like every week something odd"
11491,marge,i hope the children enjoy my special fruit punch.
11492,lisa,we got the recipe from the fruit punch advisory board.
11494,marge,but why would the advisory board give us bad advice?
11497,bart,"aw, it's ok.  there's no sugar in pixie stix."
11500,homer,i'd like to propose a toast to the coming together of the
11505,homer,"oh, ok.  but at least let me take the boat out for one last spin?"
11509,homer,"your car.   boy, what are the"
11512,homer,"marge...i think i hate ted koppel!  no, wait, i find him"
11514,homer,"hey!  what's up for today, neddy?"
11533,homer,"hey, flanders, over here!  i got us some kick-ass seats."
11541,homer,how dare you talk about ned flanders like that.  he's a
11546,homer,"right back at you, buddy.  now how about that game at the"
11548,bart,"i don't get it, lis.  you said everything would be back to"
11549,lisa,yeah.  maybe this means the end of our wacky adventures.
11551,homer,"guess what, everybody?  my great uncle boris died and left us his"
11557,bart,"after breakfast, me and milhouse are going down to the ravine."
11558,lisa,"and i'm going to the park to jam with ""the little white girls"
11559,homer,"i'd love to, honey, but daddy has to go to a beer-drinking"
11561,homer,"son, when you participate in sporting events, it's not whether"
11564,bart,"uh, it's hard for us to leave when you're standing there, mom."
11566,marge,now each one of you take a floor and get started.
11570,bart, i'm tired.  i'm hungry.  can't we just buy a new house?
11571,marge,"oh, bart, cleaning doesn't have to be a chore!  here, work to the"
11575,marge,you're not done.  i want you to throw away these old calendars
11576,homer,"are you mad, woman?  you never know when an old calendar might"
11585,marge,stop remembering tv and get back to work!
11586,homer,what's the point of all this cleaning?  are we so vain?!
11590,marge,{homer!  what's going on down there?}
11592,marge,{then stop screaming so loud!}
11598,bart,kbbl's going to give me something stupid!
11600,bart,"can't tie up the line, grampa.  "
11608,bart, kbbl is going to give me something stupid!
11614,bart,"well, all that money sounds mighty tempting, marty, but i think"
11615,homer, he's taking the elephant instead of the
11621,homer,"heh, heh, stick it to the man!"
11622,homer,"bart!  with $10,000, we'd be millionaires!  we could buy all"
11623,marge,or double-ply windows.  they look just like regular windows but
11624,lisa,you all seem to be forgetting the most important thing...which is
11645,marge,homer...it looks like it could gore.
11646,homer,heh heh...it _does_ look like al gore.
11647,bart," ew, he smells worse than anything.  hey you, elephant!"
11650,marge,i really think this is a bad idea.
11651,homer,"marge, i agree with you -- in theory.  in theory, communism"
11652,homer,what's he yelling about?
11653,lisa,he's hungry.  here you go stampy
11654,homer,maybe if we tied it down so it couldn't move it wouldn't get so
11655,lisa,"you can't do that, dad, it's cruel!"
11656,homer,"oh, everything's cruel according to you.  keeping him chained up"
11657,lisa,"he can't just eat peanuts, dad, he needs plants to live."
11659,bart,"strip the bark now, stampy."
11662,homer,{that bird!  he's killing the elephant.  stop him!}
11663,lisa,"{no, dad, he's grooming him.}"
11665,marge,"{ooh, homer, there's a bird on your head!}"
11666,homer,{i know.  he's grooming me.  mmm...elephant fresh.}
11668,lisa,"taught stampy any tricks yet, bart?"
11669,bart,"nah.  he doesn't want to learn, and i don't want to teach him."
11671,lisa,i think they're trying to get some attention.
11674,bart,"technically it's for a giraffe, but i think i can let it out a"
11675,homer,well these bills will have to paid out of your allowance.
11676,bart,you'll have to raise my allowance to about $1000 a week.
11677,homer,"then that's what i'll do, smart guy."
11680,homer,"for the ninth time, no!"
11681,bart,"uh, here's a better sign, dad."
11682,homer,"i don't have time to read it.  just give me the gist of it, son."
11684,lisa,"yeah, well you'd be grumpy too if you were taken out of"
11687,marge,stampy's food bill today was $300.
11688,homer,"marge, please, don't humiliate me in front of the money."
11689,homer,"uh, milhouse saw the elephant twice and rode him once,"
11691,homer,"well, that was under our old price structure.  under"
11694,homer,"what do you mea?  it's an elephant, isn't it?"
11699,homer,i only have two questions
11707,lisa,"dad, i think he's an ivory dealer!  his boots are ivory, his"
11708,homer,"lisa, a guy who's got lots of ivory is _less_ likely to hurt"
11712,lisa,are you an ivory dealer?
11714,bart,"dad, you can't do this.  stampy is my friend."
11715,homer,"don't worry, son.  i'll get you a new elephant."
11721,homer,"well, i'll just keep these then."
11722,bart,"don't worry, stampy.  i won't let homer sell you to that ivory"
11728,lisa,mom!  dad!  bart and stampy are gone!
11730,lisa,"i bet it's 'cause of that horrible ivory dealer, "
11731,homer,"that wasn't part of our deal, blackheart.  that wasn't part!"
11738,homer,son!  you're ok.   and you led us to the precious
11739,bart,"dad, i can't let you sell him.  stampy and i are friends."
11740,homer,forget it!  that elephant cost me thousands of dollars.
11741,lisa,"dad, how would _you_ like to be sold to an ivory dealer?"
11743,bart,even if he killed you and made your teeth into piano keys?
11744,homer,"yes, of course i would!  who wouldn't like that -- to be part of"
11748,homer,"naw, that's ok.  i'm pretty sure i can struggle my way out."
11749,homer,i'm alive.  i'm alive!  and i owe it all to this feisty feline.
11750,lisa,"dad, ""feline"" means ""cat""."
11751,homer,"elephant, honey.  it's an elephant!"
11753,homer,i guess it wouldn't be right to sell stampy after he saved my
11755,homer,"on the other hand, who's to say what's right these days, what"
11757,bart,"uh, mom?  we're stuck to dad."
11758,marge,"mmm, this is just what happened at the caramel factory."
11761,marge,"gosh, i thought he'd be happier in his true habitat."
11763,marge,then why is he attacking all those other elephants?
11766,homer, lousy job.  nothing exciting ever happens.
11768,homer,woo hoo!  what do i get?
11796,lisa, i propose to you that your heir not need be a
11800,bart,"aw, i just don't want to be here, dad.  besides, i started a fire"
11801,homer,"ok, boy, i wrote down exactly what to say.  just read it and"
11802,bart," hello, mr. ...kurns.  i bad"
11803,homer,"ooh, he card-reads good."
11804,bart,"so pick please me, mr. burns."
11805,homer,"{ it's ""kurns"", stupid!}"
11808,marge,i think bart and lisa are feeling a little upset right now.
11809,homer,"there sure is.  kids, you tried your best, and you failed"
11820,homer,"woo hoo!  we're rich!  bart, get over to the mansion and open up"
11821,lisa,"dad, mr. burns hasn't passed away yet."
11822,homer,"huh?  oh, right.  so, i guess you're in ok shape, huh?  no heart"
11826,bart,"now that you've agreed to reap the windfall of my death, i must"
11827,marge,are you thinking what i'm thinking?
11828,homer,yeah.  let's push him down the steps.
11829,marge,"bart, since he is giving you all of his money, maybe it would be"
11833,homer,"aw, how come bart gets to do that and i can't spend one night"
11835,bart,uh...i think i'd like to go home.
11837,bart,and i had the greatest time!  mr. burns' house has everything -- a
11838,lisa,it couldn't possibly be bottomless.
11839,bart,"well, for all intents and purposes."
11840,lisa,hey!  mom!  bart's throwing peas.
11841,marge,"bart, don't throw peas at your sister."
11842,bart,mr. burns throws peas at smithers.  
11843,lisa,ow!  that was a big one!
11845,homer,"ok.  lisa, quit getting in the way of your wealthy brother's"
11847,homer, that was the end piece!  that's it -- being abusive to
11848,bart,no!  this family stinks!  mr. burns nurtures my destructive side
11850,bart,"{oh, go eat some flowers!  }"
11851,homer,{aah!  my secret shame.}
11853,homer,"bart, you're coming home."
11854,bart,i want to stay here with mr. burns.
11856,homer,"or what?  you'll release the dogs, or the bees, or the dogs with"
11857,marge,i'm very concerned.  mr. burns has stolen our son and he won't
11866,bart,beats me.  but it won't be back for three hours and forty
11867,bart,for me?  but i don't know how to drive.
11871,marge,are you sure you can get him back for us?
11873,marge,what about peter fonda?
11875,homer,you idiot!  he was the most talented one.
11879,marge,"homer, that's hans moleman."
11880,homer,can i keep in anyway?  huh?  huh?
11881,bart,"mr. burns, i don't want to seem ungrateful, but i want to"
11883,homer, i do not miss bart at all.
11887,bart,"it's probably my imagination, but something about them"
11894,marge,"lisa, what are you doing?"
11895,lisa,"just trying to fill the void of random, meaningless destruction"
11896,marge,"oh, that's sweet, honey."
11897,bart, it's a little tight...
11907,homer,"hey, the trail of donuts ended --  bart!"
11915,bart,"i'm sorry, dad...you're fired!"
11920,homer,"son, i know you're upset because you thought you saw us on tv"
11922,homer,because one of them hung out with me for a week trying to get my
11923,lisa,"yeah, me too.  that midget taught me a lot about his native"
11924,marge,"the point is, the real simpson family missed you a lot and we're"
11926,homer,"right back at you, son."
11929,homer,try it.  it's like kissing a peanut!  heh heh heh.
11932,bart, they're going to eat this up at show and tell.
11933,marge,i'm not sure if i'm comfortable with the idea of your
11934,bart,"not likely.  come on, have a sense of humor about yourself!"
11936,bart,i need something for show and tell.
11937,lisa,just take one of my geodes.
11940,bart,"boys and girls, mrs. krabappel, i come before you today to"
11946,bart," what?  no, it's my dog."
11949,bart,my dog's name is santa's little helper.  one time he crawled
11985,bart,i thought i'd be jumping for joy the day skinner got fired.  now
11986,lisa,that's guilt.  you feel guilty because your stunt wound up costing
11988,homer,"{whoa, whoa, whoa -- let me get this straight.  they let"
11990,homer,"{well, i'm off to work.  }"
11991,marge,{the dog has had enough excitement.}
11992,homer,"{but marge, dogs can _never_ have enough excitement.  look"
12008,bart," principal skinner?  um, i'm real sorry about"
12013,bart, must have been a coincidence.
12017,bart,"um...it's a lot of fun.   well, it was good to see you"
12021,bart,"er, i'm kind of busy on saturday."
12026,bart,"uh, i'll pass.  hey, what's this?  "
12034,bart, yeah.  and the teachers are afraid to leave the
12036,bart,"er, i thought i heard someone say your name in the cafeteria,"
12047,bart,"don't you see, milhouse?  we've gone too far.  we need skinner"
12057,marge,"ned, homer and i are a little concerned with the way the"
12058,homer, yes.  deeply concerned.
12070,lisa,"wow, i never thought principal skinner could become any more of a"
12072,lisa,"i think you need skinner, bart.  everybody needs a nemesis."
12075,bart,"if there was some way to get rid of flanders, would you want to"
12078,bart,"oh, i think i could get him fired.  i got you fired, didn't i?"
12081,bart,well once he found out we were going to get ned flanders
12085,bart,no problemo.  just make a pass at your commanding officer!
12087,marge, what's going on in there?
12089,bart,"come on, chalmie, you fired skinner for less than this."
12101,bart,"oh, how can they imprison kids in school on a beautiful day like"
12102,lisa,"they're not imprisoning us, bart, they're --"
12112,bart," that does it, i'm outta here."
12117,lisa,"{you started off as the bad cop, but now you're the good one!"
12120,lisa,{ now _you're_ the good cop!}
12124,bart,"look, if i was under seventeen, i'd be in school, right?"
12127,bart,i can't let dad see me playing hooky!
12128,homer,i can't let the boy see me skipping work!
12133,bart,"oh my god, he is like some sort of...non...giving up...school guy!"
12140,bart,"i'm one of your nephews you don't see very often.  um, bart-"
12141,bart,"hey, mcbain, i'm a big fan, but your last movie really sucked."
12154,marge, mmm.  it says freddy quimby beat a waiter
12155,bart,but freddy quimby's innocent!
12156,lisa,how do you know?  there weren't any witnesses.
12158,lisa,you'd think someone would have seen something at a crowded party
12159,bart,"well they didn't, ok?  they didn't.  it says right here in black"
12161,bart,"lisa, i gotta tell somebody.  i was at the quimby compound"
12162,lisa,"you're a witness?  bart, you have to tell the police!"
12168,lisa,"if you testify, skinner will know you skipped school.  well, if"
12169,homer,"aw, jury duty?  i'll see that quimby kid hanged for this!"
12171,lisa,{i _knew_ it was a bad idea to watch him open the mail.}
12182,bart,"you see, lisa?  they don't need my testimony."
12183,lisa,only because mayor quimby's _buying_ his nephew's freedom.
12184,bart,ah.  the system works.  just ask claus von bulow.
12204,lisa,"well, bart, because of you, a horrible yet innocent person is"
12205,bart,hmm.  maybe i should come forward.
12208,bart," more cream corn, jimbo junior?"
12210,bart,"watch the potty-mouth, honey."
12212,bart,"what?  uh, um, yeah, uh, i just, i just wanted to say how"
12214,bart,"keep up the good work, toots.  "
12220,homer,"what does ""sequestered"" mean?"
12222,homer,"what does ""deadlocked"" mean?"
12226,homer,"so _if_ we don't all vote the same way, we'll be _deadlocked_"
12229,homer,"-- where we'll get a free room, free food, free swimming pool,"
12231,homer,"uh, how are the rest of you voting?"
12233,homer,"ok, fine.  how many s's in ""innocent""?"
12235,homer,i'm only doing what i think is right.  i believe freddy quimby
12236,homer," aw, i miss you too, marge.  but the law needs me!"
12240,lisa,"so, bart, have your insides been gnawed away by guilt yet?"
12241,bart,"sell it to hallmark, sis.  you're looking at cucumber boy, as"
12250,homer,"jump, free willy.  jump!  jump with all your might!"
12253,homer,"ohh, i don't like this new director's cut."
12257,homer,{i'm not stealing it.  hotels expect you to take a few things.
12260,bart,"mom, what if there's a really bad crummy guy who's going to jail"
12261,marge,"well, bart, your uncle arthur used to have a saying"
12264,bart,what if i can get this guy off the hook?  should -- should i do
12265,marge,"honey, you should listen to your heart, and not the voices in"
12268,bart,"well, i was hiding in the kitchen when it all happened."
12273,bart,and that's what really happened.
12277,bart, i sort of skipped school.
12282,bart,"i guess the two things cancel each other out, huh?"
12286,homer,"well, marge, it was horrible.  everyone was against me in that"
12287,marge,"good for you, homey!  you know, a lot of things happened around"
12288,homer,"right, marge, i wanna hear all about it.  [puts on ""open eye"""
12298,homer," maggie, can you point to the monkey?"
12299,lisa,"maggie, can you point to the credenza?"
12301,marge,homer!  you didn't do a very good job frosting maggie's birthday
12303,marge,"hey, hey, hey, hey!  stop it.  i made a special cake for you to"
12309,marge,"{everybody get ready!  here comes the birthday girl, in her"
12315,marge,maggie!  we've got a surprise for you.
12319,bart, don't forget to give her smeckler's powder.
12330,bart,kids who climb on rocks!
12335,lisa,doesn't this family know any songs that aren't commercials?
12338,homer," or if not then, christmas..."
12342,marge,"homey, you know, it's funny.  both my mother and your father seem"
12343,homer,hee hee hee!  that is funny.
12344,marge,"yeah.  anyway, maybe they could go to a matinee together, or"
12345,homer,"marge, please, old people don't need companionship.  they need to"
12346,marge,"homer, would you please stop reading that ross perot pamphlet?"
12347,marge,"say, i've got a neat idea!  why don't you go in and pick up my"
12353,marge,"you know, mom, you and abe have a lot in common.  um...hmm.  you"
12372,bart,"pardon me, sir.  forgive my clumsiness."
12376,bart," uh, yes.  my name is homer simpson, and i'd like to"
12377,marge,well i think it's wonderful that your father has fallen in love
12378,homer,well i'm opposed to the whole thing.  damn opposed!
12379,bart,"he's damn opposed.  damn, damn, _damn_ opposed!"
12380,marge,"bart!  homer, what possible reason could you have against grampa"
12381,homer,"if he marries your mother, marge, we'll be brother and sister."
12382,marge,"hello, mom?...fine.  you know, abe had a very nice time with you"
12384,marge," grampa, shh!  i know my mother.  if you"
12389,marge,"-- i love you.  i love you, mom, gotta go!"
12403,bart,"hey, lis!  guess who's got a genuine itchy and scratchy animation"
12404,lisa,oh!  that is so cool!  that is so exciting!  that is so --
12405,bart,"oh, no.  i used dad's credit card to buy this!"
12406,lisa,yeesh.  how much was it?
12411,homer,"dad, that will never work.  if you want to make your move, you"
12416,bart,is this cel worth anything?  
12418,bart,can't you give me anything for it.
12448,marge,mom's almost ready for her date.  she sure seems taken by this
12449,homer,"dad says this new guy's a repulsive, obnoxious old billionaire."
12452,marge,"he's an awful, awful, _awful_ man!  i guess if he makes mom"
12453,homer,"that's right, money.  your money's happiness is all that moneys."
12454,bart,"you know, gramma really likes it when her boyfriends are nice to"
12456,bart,very well.  you leave me no choice.  this gun is filled with
12467,bart,"dad, i'm really sorry, but i charged $350 on your credit card."
12469,bart,"don't worry, here's the cash!"
12470,homer,woo-hoo!  $350.  now i can buy seventy transcripts of
12471,bart,"but dad -- oh well, he's happy.  i'm going to keep the mary"
12475,marge,"oh, mom, you can't marry mr. burns.  he's an evil man."
12478,marge,what about abe simpson?  don't you have any feelings for him?
12480,marge,"we're all aware of grampa's problems, but compared to mr. burns,"
12483,lisa,where's grampa?  wasn't he invited?
12484,bart,"yeah, but his reply envelope just had a check to the gas company"
12507,homer,"whoo!  don't try to eat these so-called ""chips""."
12509,homer,"huh?  oh, ok.  i'll take three.   d'oh!  d'oh!"
12514,homer, something was said...not good.  what was it?
12516,homer, something said...not good.
12518,homer,"so anywho, last night we're playing poker, right?  as usual, i'm"
12521,marge,"{uh, we don't think you're slow.  on the other hand, it's not"
12522,homer,"{you think i don't want to?  it's those tv networks, marge"
12523,homer,"oh, who am i kidding?  i _am_ slow."
12524,marge,"oh, homey, if you feel so bad about yourself, there's always"
12525,homer,take another bath in malt liquor?
12526,marge,there's that...or you could take an adult education course.
12527,homer,"oh, and how is ""education"" supposed to make me feel smarter?"
12528,marge,that's because you were drunk!
12531,homer,wait a minute...even lenny is teaching a class!  look at the way
12533,homer,"well, i can tell the difference between butter and ""i can't"
12535,homer,"oh, i've failed again.  everyone can teach a class but me.  i'm"
12537,homer,that depends...is there another way to get this job?  [blinks
12539,homer,i'll do it.  _anything_ to get me out of that house away from all
12541,marge,"homer, that's supposed to be _leather_ patches on a _tweed_"
12542,homer,"ah -- incorrect, marge.  _two_ perfectly good jackets."
12543,lisa,"_i_ think it's great you're a teacher, dad.  so, will be you"
12546,homer,"can't talk now, flanders.  _i've_ got a class to teach."
12549,homer,nothing for me today.  _i've_ got a class to teach.
12551,homer,it's all right!  i'm a teacher.
12553,homer,all right.  the first thing they told me to do was to make sure
12555,homer," ew.  ok, let's get started."
12559,homer,yeah...yeah!  that'll eat up some time.
12570,homer,"huh?  yeah, i was listening.  very funny."
12572,homer,"well, yes, yes, to the untrained eye, i'm eating an orange,"
12578,homer," oh, i told marge this wouldn't work"
12580,homer,"no, that's not what i meant!  marge and i always talk things"
12583,homer,i was telling marge we could save some money if she only dyed
12585,homer,"oh, yeah.  she's been as grey as a mule since she was"
12586,homer,"i went on for hours, and they were hanging on my every word!  i"
12592,marge,whatever do you mean?  i don't die my hair.  
12594,marge,i don't know what you're talking about.  
12597,marge,"homer, i really don't like you telling personal secrets in your"
12598,homer,"marge, i didn't tell 'em personal stuff."
12599,marge,today at the kwik-e-mart everybody knew i dyed my hair!
12600,homer,"oh, you mean about you.  all right, maybe i said some things,"
12602,marge,"mmm, i'm happy about that.  but i think you can be a good teacher"
12603,homer,"look, marge, you don't know what it's like.  _i'm_ the one out"
12604,marge,"homer, don't _ever_ tell them personal stuff about me again!"
12606,homer,"now, what is a wedding?  well, webster's dictionary describes a"
12608,homer,"this is a place of learning, not a house of...hearing about"
12612,homer,i _do_ have a story about two other young marrieds...
12614,homer,"well, let's just call them, uh, mr. x and mrs. y. so anyway, mr."
12615,marge,"oh, homer, don't you have to get to class?"
12616,homer,"not tonight, marge.  tonight, we can eat a nice leisurely dinner"
12617,marge,"oh, well that will be lov --  what the darn --"
12618,homer,"marge, you'll never guess what"
12620,homer,"so, little lisa, apple of my eye"
12621,lisa,i find this demeaning and embarrassing beyond my worst
12622,homer, and how's my little major-leaguer?  catch any
12623,bart,"oh, me and milhouse took some mail from the mail truck and threw"
12624,homer,"son, i know you meant well, but that wasn't the right thing to"
12625,bart,what the hell are you talking about?  you're the one who double-
12629,homer,"well, now that the little ones have toddled off to bed --"
12630,marge, i want this to end _now_!
12632,marge," all right, ok.  everybody out!"
12634,marge,"get out, get out, get out, get out, get out out out out --"
12635,homer,"all right, we're breaking early tonight, class.  for tomorrow,"
12639,homer,but i'm not in the class --
12642,homer,"come on, marge, let me in!  there's crickets out here."
12643,marge,"you just don't get it, do you, homer?  you told personal things"
12644,homer,but i learned my lesson!  it'll never happen again.
12646,homer,"aw, marge is throwing me out for blabbing about her elbow thing"
12647,marge,"kids, your father and i are going through a really tough time"
12648,bart,"wow, i've never seen mom so mad at homer before."
12649,lisa,"i'll tell you a secret, bart"
12650,bart,earthbase?  this is commander bart mccool.  we are under
12653,homer,"don't mind me, boys, just scrubbing my undies."
12655,homer,"keep up the roughhousing, son!  without a strong male presence"
12656,homer,"oh, good.  reverend lovejoy will make marge take me back!"
12661,lisa,"here dad, i brought you some nice -- aah!"
12663,lisa,"dad, that's just a plant."
12664,homer, lisa!  you will respect your new mother.  now give her a
12665,homer,"omigod omigod omigod!   all right, let's get out story"
12667,lisa," look, i brought you some nice pudding!"
12668,homer,"ah, your flesh mother used to bring me pudding."
12669,homer,"oh, i miss marge.  lisa, you're smart; help me trick her into"
12670,lisa,"dad, you can't trick somebody into loving you.  there's a reason"
12672,homer, i'll bet you $40 if you think of it for me.
12676,homer,"all right, brain, it's all up to you.  if you don't think of what"
12678,homer,{ok.  but then we gotta get to work.
12680,marge,"oh, my!  i'm very flattered, but i'm not really interested."
12682,marge,"oh, why don't you come inside for a drink of water?"
12685,homer,moe!  what are you doing here?
12687,marge," here's your water, moe."
12690,marge,"homer, what happened to you?"
12691,homer,"marge, i figured out what i can give you that no one else can"
12692,marge,"oh, here, let me help you."
12693,homer,"wait a minute...wait, that's it!  i know now what i can offer you"
12695,marge,"homer, that's not a good thing."
12696,homer,"are you kidding?  it's a wondrous, marvelous thing!  marge, i"
12697,marge,but how do i know i can trust you?
12699,marge,"i must admit, you really do make a gal feel needed."
12700,homer,wait till my class hears about this!   kidding.
12701,homer," oh, it's great to be indoors with my family."
12702,lisa,"i'm really glad you're back, dad.  i knew you could do it."
12704,homer,"hey, this is dated two weeks ago."
12705,bart,"oh, sorry.  here's a fresh one."
12706,marge,"and i have a special present for you, but i'll give it to you"
12707,homer,special present?  i don't want to wait!  i want it now.  i want
12713,bart,"homer, my hat goes off to you."
12714,homer,"it's _cool_ in here, boy.  for the rest of the summer, we can"
12715,marge," homer, the fridge wasn't meant to be used"
12716,homer,i got the idea when i noticed the refrigerator was cold.
12717,marge,won't this overload the motor?
12718,homer,"marge, can you set the oven to ""cold""?"
12724,lisa,"aw, face it, bart.  our salvation isn't just going to"
12727,bart," look, lis, i snatched five bathing suits --"
12731,bart,"so long, lis.  i'm going to stow away under water and go where the"
12733,bart,"oh well.  same time tomorrow, otto?"
12739,lisa,"dad, as you know, we've been swimming, and we've developed a"
12742,homer,i understand.  let us celebrate our new arrangement with the
12744,homer,"ooh, the tinkler!  i like the sound of that.  we'll take it!"
12745,marge,is it true we should wait at least an hour after eating before
12747,homer,all right.  everybody in the pool!
12756,marge,"bart, are all these children friends of yours?"
12757,bart,"friends and well-wishers, yes."
12759,bart,"people, people!  it's time we all discussed the pool safety"
12770,bart,"aw, i'm going to miss the whole summer."
12771,homer,"don't worry, boy.  when you get a job like me, you'll miss"
12774,bart,"hey, guys!  sign my cast?   sign my cast?"
12776,bart,"faithful milhouse.  you'll spend the long, hot days by my"
12778,bart,but you're wearing your glasses.
12780,bart," well, it looks like it's just you and me, barty-boy."
12782,bart," you know, this isn't so bad.  i'll just spend"
12788,homer,"ah, there's nothing like rising with the sun for a quiet,"
12789,lisa,"dad, you have to put chlorine in the water every day to keep it"
12792,marge,"oh look, there's bart!  wave to him!  "
12797,bart, don't turn on that light!
12798,lisa,"sorry, i just came to see how you were feeling."
12800,lisa,what are you writing here?  a play?
12802,lisa,"y'uh huh,  cast of characters"
12803,bart," gimme that, it's a work in progress!"
12804,bart,so...how do you like being miss popularity?
12805,lisa,"oh, well, you know, it ain't so great."
12806,bart,there was an optics festival and i wasn't informed?
12807,marge,"this was a lovely idea, homey.  come here and kiss me..."
12810,bart,"wow, the universe is so boring.  i know!  i'll use this to peer"
12812,bart,"oh, i'm never _ever_ going to see anything interesting with this"
12814,bart,this can't be what it looks like
12818,bart,"oh, this can't be what it looks like!  there's gotta be some other"
12820,bart,then that's not the real ned flanders.
12822,bart,"if that's not flanders, he's done his homework."
12829,bart, he's going to kill rod and todd too.  that's horrible!
12834,lisa," they're only using you for your pool, you know."
12837,lisa,"huh?  hello?  hey, i'm stuck in here!"
12839,bart,"listen, ned flanders murdered his wife!"
12840,homer,but why?  she's such a fox.
12841,marge,"mmm, i wish you'd stop spreading bad rumors about people."
12842,bart,"sure, that was twenty minutes ago."
12844,lisa,"bart, i'm really sorry i've been ignoring you lately.  i got"
12845,bart,you can start making it up to me right now.  flanders is leaving
12846,lisa,"bart, i'm here for you, but i'm not going to break into somebody's"
12847,bart,"all right, you're right, you're right, let's, let's just forget"
12850,bart," an ax.  he's got an ax!  i'll save you, lisa!"
12855,bart,came to stop you from murdering lisa like you murdered your wife!
12858,bart, but i distinctly heard you say that maude was with
12860,bart,but i saw the murder and then i saw you bury the corpse in the
12862,bart,but i heard a woman scream.
12866,bart,"oh.  well, i guess that explains everything."
12867,homer,not everything.  there's still the little matter of the
12869,homer," oh, i see.  then everything is wrapped up in a neat"
12874,bart,"lisa, will you keep it down?  i'm making a crank phone call to"
12878,lisa,"it's my room, and i can do what i want."
12879,bart,oh yeah?  well i can do what i want in _my_ room.
12881,bart, i can keep this up _all day_.
12882,homer,"lisa, stop the racket.  i'm trying to fix your mother's camera."
12883,marge,"my, these seas are certainly heaving."
12885,marge, does that earring mean you're a pirate?
12887,marge,"mmm!  lisa, stop blowing my sex.  i mean, stop blowing your sax,"
12888,lisa,"mom, i'm auditioning for first chair in the school band and i've"
12889,marge,"i'm sorry, but i sacrificed a very expensive camera just to get"
12896,lisa," sorry, ralph.  that would defeat the purpose of"
12909,lisa,"i never made miss hoover ""yowie""..."
12910,lisa,"hi, alison, i'm lisa simpson.  oh, it's great to finally meet"
12912,lisa,you're younger than me too?
12914,lisa,no...i just like to smell my lunch.
12915,lisa,"gee, i never met anyone who's skipped a grade before."
12917,lisa,"well, i'm sure i could have, but, heh, i'd hate to leave behind"
12920,lisa,"well, i gotta go.  i have to practice for band auditions."
12924,lisa,i'm going for first chair this year.
12926,lisa,"wow!   we have so much in common, i'm sure we'll"
12929,bart,hurry up and finish eating!
12930,homer,"you're steering fine, boy.  hard to the right!"
12936,homer,jackknifed sugar truck!   sugar?
12937,homer,"don't worry, buddy.  here's a quarter; call for help at the"
12939,bart,"homer, that was downright decent of you."
12940,homer,"we've hit the jackpot here!  white gold, texas tea!  ..."
12941,bart,"dad, isn't this stealing?"
12942,homer,"read your town charter, boy.  ""if foodstuff should touch the"
12946,lisa,why am i still rotting away in the second grade instead of being
12947,marge,"i dunno honey, i guess that's the school's decision to make."
12948,lisa,"well, did you ever talk to anyone at the school?  make a few"
12950,marge,"homer, i really appreciate you making dinner, but this food"
12952,homer,that's because i've loaded it with sugar!
12953,marge,but the grocery store sells sugar for thirty-five cents a pound.
12954,lisa,and it doesn't have nails and broken glass in it.
12955,homer,"those are prizes!   ooh, a blasting cap."
12972,lisa,"i need help, mom.  there's another girl at school who's smarter,"
12973,marge,"well, you'll always be number one to me --"
12974,bart," ahem, hello...first born within earshot."
12975,marge,"mmm, i meant my number-one girl --"
12976,lisa,but she's better than me at everything that makes me special!
12977,marge,"oh, believe me honey, she's more scared of you than you are of"
12978,lisa," you're thinking of bears, mom."
12983,lisa," i can't tell you either, ralph."
12985,bart,"i can't stand to see you so miserable, lis...unless it's from"
12990,lisa,"i appreciate the offer, but it goes against every moral fiber in"
12991,bart,"suit yourself.  if you change your mind, here's my card."
12992,lisa,i don't need a card.  you live in the room next to me.
12994,homer,and you didn't think i'd make any money.  i found a dollar while
12995,marge,"while you were out ""earning"" that dollar, you lost forty dollars"
12996,homer,woo hoo!  a four-day weekend.
12997,lisa,"hey, i _am_ above average!  so what if alison's ahead of me?"
12999,lisa,why would they come to our concert just to boo us?
13000,bart,"lis, i did some checking on this alison character, and i know"
13002,bart,"yep, she's clean as a bean, but...i _did_ tip off the feds as"
13006,lisa, i've got to stop being so petty.  i should be alison's
13007,bart,"way to go, lis.  i mean, why compete with someone who's just going"
13010,lisa,you're a wonderful person.
13022,lisa,you're finished _already_?  but the competition isn't for weeks!
13025,lisa," ha ha, it's great, it's really great."
13028,homer, must...protect...sugar.  thieves everywhere.  the strong
13030,homer," in america, first you get the sugar, then"
13033,marge,i want you to forget about guarding the stupid sugar!  you're
13034,homer,"oh, am i?  am i really?  ah ha!"
13038,homer,"you see, marge?  do you see?"
13039,marge,"homer, when are you going to give up this crazy sugar scheme?"
13040,homer,"never, marge!  never.  i can't live the button-down life like"
13042,marge,"look, just get rid of the sugar, ok?"
13044,lisa,"look, bart.  it almost killed me, but i handcrafted all 75"
13049,bart,"well...the important thing is, _we_ survived."
13050,lisa,"oh, who am i kidding?  there's no _way_ i'm ever going to beat"
13051,bart,"sure there is!  ...but it involves being a bit underhanded, a bit"
13052,lisa,i'll do whatever it takes.
13053,bart,then welcome to the nether regions of the soul.
13054,bart,"now, here's what we do.  tomorrow morning when alison comes out of"
13056,bart,"well, there's bound to be some splash-back."
13057,lisa,"bart, her being wet won't help me win the competition."
13058,bart,"well...we could just sabotage her diorama, humiliating her in"
13060,bart,leaving her primed for the most dramatic hose-soaking of her life!
13071,homer,bees are on the what now?
13075,homer,"no!  my sugar is melting.  melting!  oh, what a world."
13078,homer,"it's ok, marge.  i've learned my lesson.  a mountain of"
13085,bart,"lisa, here is -- as the french say -- le fake diorama.  i'll"
13101,lisa,aah!  it's the beating of that hideous heart!
13105,bart,"you're a shoo-in now, lis."
13106,lisa,"after the way i've behaved, i don't deserve to win."
13114,lisa,"i'm really sorry about what i did, alison.  it's no shame being"
13116,lisa,only if we're the best.
13118,lisa,"hey ralph, want to come with me and alison to play ""anagrams""?"
13122,marge, this romance is so full of heartfelt passion.  i can
13125,homer, wha?  what's wrong?  house run away?  dog's on fire?
13126,marge,"homey, do you think the romance has gone out of our lives?"
13134,marge,hmm...i knew we shouldn't have put a fireplace in the bedroom.
13135,marge,how many times can you laugh at that cat getting hit by the moon?
13137,lisa,"not exactly...they pieced it together from old shows, but it"
13139,lisa,ren and stimpy do it all the time.
13140,marge,"yes they do, and when was the last time you heard anyone talk"
13141,marge,"children, your father and i have fed and clothed you but we've"
13143,bart,"no need, mom.  we already learned in school."
13145,marge,"i mean ""romance"", not ""love""."
13146,lisa,"mom, romance is dead.  it was acquired in a hostile takeover by"
13147,marge,all you have to do  is think about your most
13152,bart,"yeah, al.  last name, coholic."
13163,marge,ask your heart what its fondest desire is.
13166,homer,mmm...invisible cola.  
13167,homer,mmm...forbidden donut.  
13168,homer,{mmm...sacrilicious.  }
13172,marge,"no, think about people.  think about moments in your life that"
13175,marge,that's not the idea at all...
13177,marge,"i made the right decision to stay with my homey, so there was no"
13179,marge,so if you kind of mentally snip out the part where i already had
13180,homer,"marge, i want you to stop seeing the jacques.  you can let him"
13182,homer,"whew!  that was a close one, kids."
13186,bart,what happened to mindy?
13187,marge," yes, what _did_ happen to her?"
13188,homer,"ehh, she hit the bottle pretty hard and lost her job."
13190,marge,does anyone else have a love story?
13191,lisa,"yes, i do.  and just like your love stories, it's tragic and"
13193,marge,"lisa, not all romances turn out that way.  bart, do you have a"
13198,marge," well, as jerry lee lewis would say, ""there's a whole"
13199,lisa,"mom, doesn't _any_ love story have a happy ending?"
13200,marge,of course!  remember when...uh...your aunt selma got married?
13204,marge," oh wait, wait, that's no good.  i know...your"
13206,lisa,that doesn't seem like a happy ending.  that seems more like a
13207,marge,i give up.  did anybody learn anything about love tonight?
13208,bart,we learned it screws everybody up.
13209,marge,"well, there's that side of it, but there's also -- oh, help me"
13210,lisa,"sorry, mom.  i've decided to save my love for someone who's"
13212,marge,"well kids, i tried, but maybe you're right."
13213,homer,"wait a minute, marge.  love isn't hopeless.  maybe i'm no expert"
13225,lisa,"dad, remember how you said going to itchy and scratchy land"
13226,homer,"oh, everything's too damned expensive these days.  look at"
13227,bart,but now itchy and scratchy land is cutting ticket prices in
13229,homer,"no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  ask your mother."
13232,lisa,we're going to itchy and scratchy land!
13233,marge,no.  i've already planned our vacation.  we're going to the
13234,marge,it's shaped like a diner.  and it's on this really tall pole.
13235,lisa,"mom, dad!  bart's dead!"
13237,lisa,"you know, itchy and scratchy land isn't for kids.  they have a"
13238,homer, tv town!  hammock land!
13239,marge,"hmm, recipe-related bumper cars."
13240,marge,"now wait a minute, i'm not sure about this.  every time we've"
13241,homer,embarrassed?  what are you talking about?
13242,marge,"well, there was our trip to the amish country..."
13244,homer,"heh heh heh, hey look, marge!  they're still not fighting back."
13245,marge,even worse was our trip to sandy beach...
13249,marge,"this year i want us to do things together as a family, and get a"
13250,bart,"don't worry mom, we'll make you proud of us."
13251,homer,"lobster hat, fishnet speedo junior, wheelie shoes, ""invisible"
13252,marge,"and remember, every morning give one bowl of kibble to santa's"
13259,homer,"ok, let's make a pact.  this is going to be the best vacation"
13261,homer,"ah, the interstate.  fasten your seat belts, kids"
13263,homer,"don't worry, i've got an ace up my sleeve."
13266,homer,"{oh my god...what'll i do, what'll i do?}"
13267,marge,"{what's the matter with you, homer?  we don't have any fruits or"
13268,homer,"{ the whole trunk's full of 'em, marge!"
13271,homer,and now to absorb some local color through the magic of am radio.
13275,marge,we better find a motel and stop for the night.
13276,homer," we don't need to do that, marge.  i'm not tired, i'm"
13277,bart,whew!  glad that wasn't us.
13278,homer," north...south...aw, nuts to this!  i'm going to"
13279,marge,"homer, no, you're going to get lost."
13280,homer,"trust me, marge.  with today's modern cars, you _can't_ get lost,"
13285,homer,one adult and four children.
13290,homer,"well, ok, if it's fun...let's see, uh...i'll take $1100 worth."
13293,lisa,"aw, cool!  that is neato."
13295,bart,"yeah, but it's just pretend violence, which is _actually_"
13300,marge,_when_ do you show the consequences?  on tv that mouse pulled out
13302,bart," i'll have a brain burger with extra pus, please."
13305,marge,homer!  we just got here and already i'm mortified beyond belief
13306,bart,"i was just ordering a cheeseburger, mom.  they have violent"
13307,marge,"oh, i see.  all right, hmm...i'll have the baby guts."
13313,lisa,"aw, look at that cute little baby ax."
13314,marge,"it's cute, but i'm sure it's very sharp and probably dirty."
13316,marge,"see all that stuff in there, homer?  that's why your robot never"
13317,marge,"you know, part of spending time together as a family is spending"
13319,marge,y'uh huh.  i'm sure we'll appreciate each other all the more when
13320,homer,it _is_ the seventies!  right down to the smallest detail.
13321,marge,hey...the bartender even looks like john travolta.
13323,bart,"look at all this great stuff, lis!"
13328,lisa,who are all these characters?
13329,bart,"well, you're probably too young to remember the short-lived ""itchy"
13330,lisa,"oh yeah, heh.  they weren't very funny."
13331,bart,i dunno...disgruntled goat had his moments.
13334,marge,it must be wonderful to ring in the new year over and over
13340,lisa,i wonder if this kind of violence really _does_ desensitize
13341,bart,want to get a sno cone?
13343,bart,"so, mr. itchy, you think you're god's gift to women, do you?"
13346,bart, can you believe i keep getting away with this...officer?
13351,homer,"aw, i kicked one of those stupid itchy characters in the"
13352,bart,"yeah.  there's just no way to resist it, is there."
13353,marge,"i want all five t-shirts to say ""best vacation ever""."
13359,marge,"oh, i'm so embarrassed i wish there was a hole i could just"
13365,marge,i have nothing to say to you.
13366,homer,"but marge, i was a political prisoner!"
13367,marge,how were you a political prisoner?
13368,homer,i kicked a giant mouse in the butt!  do i have to draw you a
13370,lisa,"dad, i think you're wrong about that robot trying to be your"
13372,bart,a chopper!  we're saved!
13374,marge,"oh, my.  it looks like we're doomed."
13375,homer,"back, you robots!  nobody ruins my family vacation but me...and"
13376,lisa,dad!  the flash must have scrambled their circuits.
13377,homer,"what are you, the narrator?"
13378,lisa,aah!  just keep taking pictures!
13379,bart, i'll get more cameras!
13380,marge,i don't approve of that...
13381,bart, hey mouse...say cheese.
13382,homer,"die, bad robots, die!   with a dry, cool wit like that, i"
13383,bart,who would have thought that our visit to itchy and scratchy land
13385,marge,are you two bonkers?  we almost got killed...not to mention all
13386,lisa,"but mom, it's exactly what you wanted in a vacation"
13387,marge," you know, you're right.  this truly _was_ the best"
13389,homer,but there are five of us.
13394,marge,"i hope you realize now that violence on tv may be funny, but it's"
13395,bart, but it _would_ be funny to someone who was watching us.
13397,lisa,"no, mom, he's right.   observe"
13398,marge,"oh, my!  lisa, go to your room."
13404,homer,"nonononono, guys...i'm not very political -- i usually think"
13410,marge, mmm...this sounds awfully controversial.
13411,lisa,"i don't like him either, mom, but i'm doing a report on local"
13412,bart,you think you're so big because your class always gets to do
13413,marge,"mmm...bart, i wish you wouldn't lie like that.  [takes bundle,"
13419,lisa,"dad, i had to listen to this jerk all morning.  can we listen to"
13420,homer,"when _i'm_ driving the car, _i_ get to choose the radio station."
13421,homer, i can't take this any more!  let's switch back.
13424,lisa, that sounds like sideshow bob!
13425,homer,"yes, ma'am.  sideshow bob, yakking it up on the old yak box."
13426,lisa,"dad, i'll spare you the embarrassment of admitting you don't"
13428,lisa,sideshow bob used to be krusty the klown's sidekick.  in 1990 he
13430,lisa,"when he got out, he married aunt selma and tried to murder her."
13432,lisa,"bart, your mortal enemy is on the radio!  "
13436,lisa,i meant your _other_ mortal enemy.  sideshow bob.
13437,bart, sideshow bob?  oh.  i'm only ten and i already got two
13474,lisa,"hmm.  bart, we can't let bob steal the spotlight.  we're going"
13477,lisa, uncle mayor was just saying that us kids
13483,bart, hey four-eyes!  vote quimby.  hey beardo!
13484,lisa,this time he's the _lesser_ of two evils.
13496,lisa,i hope that flu doesn't affect his performance out there.
13497,bart,don't worry...he's taken a million of these capsules.
13500,lisa,there's no councilman les whinen.
13505,homer, hmm...i don't agree with his bart-
13509,homer,"aah!  it's the rapture!  quick, get bart out of the house before"
13511,marge,"homer, we've got to stop them!"
13512,homer,"i know what you're up to, mayor terwigiger.  and no one in my"
13515,bart,oh.  you mean i have to repeat the fourth grade?
13522,bart,cool!  i call the flintstone phone.
13524,homer,we're going to lose our house and end up living under a bridge
13525,lisa,i don't think bob won that election legally.  i can't believe a
13527,lisa,i thought this was a secret ballot.
13529,bart,so whoever it is who wrote that note wants to meet us here
13530,lisa,"this is so cool, bart.  we're just like woodward and bernstein."
13531,bart,"yeah, except their dad wasn't waiting in the car reading archie"
13532,homer,stuck-up riverdale punks...think they're too good for me!
13534,bart,how the hell do you know?
13539,lisa,this is hopeless.  they're going to demolish our house for sure.
13540,bart,but dad can't afford six dollars a night!
13541,bart,"lis!  lis, come here, i found him!  i found edgar neubauer."
13543,lisa," no, bart, don't you see?  dead people can't vote."
13549,lisa,i have a plan.  i think we can trap him.
13551,lisa,"because we all know you're a naive pawn -- puppet, if you will --"
13553,bart,you were just barlow's lackey.
13554,lisa,you were ronny to his nancy!
13556,lisa,ringo to his rest of the beatles!
13567,lisa,"bart, we did it!  now we get to keep our house and you get to go"
13568,bart,"oh, tomorrow we were going to find out who the dish ran away with."
13577,marge,"hello once again.  as usual, i must warn you all that this year's"
13578,bart,there's nothing wrong with your television set.  do not attempt
13579,homer,"what's that, boy?  we're in control?  hey, look!  i can see my"
13580,bart,dad!  you're ruining the mood.
13582,bart,"for the next half-hour, _we_ will control what you see and hear."
13585,homer,"well, it was a long trip, but we're almost there."
13586,marge,"homer, did you remember to lock the front door of the house?"
13588,homer,"well, it's been two long trips, but we're finally almost there"
13589,marge,"when you locked the front door, did you remember to lock the back"
13591,lisa, oh no!  we left grampa back at the gas station.
13598,bart,hey!  i found a shortcut through your hedge maze.
13609,marge,"homer, i'm impressed!  you're taking this quite well."
13610,homer, i'll kill you...i'll kill all of you!
13612,homer,"sorry, sorry.  don't worry...there's plenty i can do to keep"
13613,lisa,"mom, is dad going to kill us?"
13614,marge,we're just going to have to wait and see.
13618,homer,why should i kill my family?
13620,homer,you don't look so happy.
13622,marge,homer?  homey?  hmm... what he's typed will
13625,homer,"so what do you think, marge?  all i need is a title.  i was"
13635,homer," i'm mike wallace, i'm morley"
13637,marge," hello, police?  this is marge simpson.  my"
13639,bart,"don't worry, mom.  i can use my... ""shinning""..."
13643,marge,"oh, my.  i hope that rug was scotchgarded."
13645,homer,"television!  teacher, mother,  secret lover."
13647,bart, homer...change channel!
13652,homer,"you know, marge, i've had my share of troubles, but sitting here"
13653,lisa,dad!  your hand is jammed in the toaster!
13654,homer,aah!  get it off!  get it off!   get it off
13655,bart,dad!  it's in there again!
13656,homer,this shouldn't be too hard to fix...with the right tools.
13657,homer,there...better than new!
13661,homer,i've gone back to the time when dinosaurs weren't just confined
13662,homer,"aah!  ok, don't panic -- remember the advice your father gave you"
13664,homer,fine.  as long as i stand perfectly still and don't touch
13665,homer,phew!  i'm back.  [walks up stairs to kitchen where family eats
13668,homer,"hey, what the hell is that geek flanders doing on tv?"
13670,bart,"don't you remember, dad?  flanders is the unquestioned lord and"
13673,homer, what the hell are you smiling at?
13680,homer,"oh no, they're gaining on me.  wait!  i have an idea!"
13681,homer,this time i'm not going to touch a thing.
13682,homer," hey, where is everybody?"
13683,bart,hey...there's a bug that looks like dad.  let's kill it!
13686,bart,"good morning, father dear.   hope you're well."
13687,lisa,are we taking the new lexus to aunt patty and selma's funeral
13688,homer,"hmm, fabulous house, well-behaved kids, sisters-in-law dead,"
13689,marge,donut?  what's a donut?
13691,marge,hmm.  it's raining again.
13698,homer,what's my name?  what color is the sky?  what of donuts?  what?!
13699,marge,"homer, the sky is blue, donuts are plentiful, friday is t.g.i.f."
13700,homer,nothing...nothing at all.  let's just eat.
13704,bart,hey everybody!  let's all turn our desks backwards before mrs.
13722,bart,"hmm, i wonder where jimbo is today?  he should have beaten us"
13728,lisa,"bart, does it strike you as odd that uter disappeared and"
13730,lisa,mom!  mom!  you've gotta help
13733,marge,"no buts!  you march right back to that school, look them"
13739,bart,"don't worry, guys.  something _always_ comes along to save us."
13740,marge,"relax, honey, you were just having a crazy nightmare.  you're"
13742,homer,"uh oh, it's seeping in.  stupid cheap weatherstripping!"
13746,lisa,"remember, bart -- i mean, dances in underwear -- we take the"
13747,bart,"all right, thinks too much"
13750,bart," throw down your weapons and kiss the prairie,"
13752,bart,"that's not fair, nelson.  they didn't have the killmatic 3000"
13754,marge, bart!  lisa!  time for church!
13757,bart,why the crap do we have to go to church anyway?
13758,marge,you just answered your own question with that commode mouth.
13763,bart, wow!  there _is_ a god!
13767,bart, i've never felt this way about a girl
13769,lisa,"don't be so hard on yourself, bart.  it's not your fault jessica"
13770,bart,is it my hair?  my overbite?  the fact that i've worn the same
13771,lisa,"no, bart.  i just think you and jessica are too different from"
13773,bart,"yes, ma'am.  i'd like to return to your wonderful sunday"
13775,bart,"i've changed my ways.  _please_ give me another chance, ma'am."
13778,bart,"you know, the great thing about sunday school is we're finally"
13780,bart,"somehow i gotta convince her i'm a good person!  all right, i"
13782,bart,must...fight...satan...make it...up to him...later!
13784,bart,there is just no pleasing a girl like that!   all
13787,bart, that'll hold me.  at least until i get my hands on
13795,bart,there's only on thing to do at a moment like this
13797,homer,{i can't believe my little boy is already going on his first
13798,marge,"{oh, that's sweet homer.  our son _is_ growing up, isn't he.}"
13799,homer,"{no, it's not that.  didn't you hear?  they have no bananas!"
13801,bart,"well, in _my_ family grades aren't that important.  it's"
13804,bart,"actually, numbers don't have much use in my future career"
13806,bart,"well, no offense, lady, but what you don't know could fill"
13808,bart,sorry.  i have a kind of a short fuse...which some find
13813,bart, no i'm not!  i'm really --
13815,bart," i'm bad to the bone, honey."
13817,bart,but your father said --
13819,bart,"smart, beautiful..._and_ a liar!  so much better than that"
13820,bart,"excellent!  you're incredible, jessica"
13822,bart,oh yeah?  i'll prove it.
13824,bart,"jessica, we just -- oof!  "
13830,bart,"actually, i was hoping i could sit down for just a second."
13832,bart,wow!   now i have the energy to do anything!
13833,bart,"jessica, i think this is too steep."
13835,marge,have you noticed any change in bart?
13837,marge,no...he looks like something might be disturbing him.
13838,homer,probably misses his old glasses.
13839,marge,i guess we could get more involved in bart's activities but then
13840,homer,"yeah, and then we'd get the chair."
13841,marge,that's not what i meant.
13842,homer,"it was, marge, admit it."
13844,bart,"uh, we should get to class."
13846,bart,we could get in trouble for being late.
13849,lisa,"i can't believe it, bart.  i'd always thought jessica was so"
13850,bart,"she's like a milk dud, lis"
13853,lisa,"bart, it's naive to think you can change a person...except maybe"
13858,bart,there.  if i can just get through this many days without seeing
13860,marge,"time for church, bart!  i bet your little friend jessica will be"
13863,lisa,"bart, be strong!  you don't need that little hellcat."
13866,bart,"well, jessica...i don't think we should hang out together any"
13867,homer,"oh, good.  here comes the collection plate!"
13868,marge," ""30 cents off shake'n'bake""...homer!"
13869,homer,"we can spare it, marge!  we've been blessed."
13871,bart, jessica!  what are you doing?
13873,bart,stealing from the collection basket is really wrong!  even _i_
13877,bart," now just relax.  for once, you didn't do"
13881,homer, stop him!  he's headed for the window!
13883,homer,"son, if you can look me in the eye and say you didn't take the"
13885,homer,why you little --  how can you look me in the eye
13886,marge,"homer, stop it!  i believe him."
13888,marge, that's what he wore to church.
13890,marge,"bart, honey, do you know who _did_ take the money?"
13892,homer,"see, son?  telling the truth isn't so bad."
13895,bart,"well, it seems like if you really care for me, you should come"
13897,bart, that doesn't make any sense.
13899,bart,"jessica, you're really beautiful, but _you_ are not very nice."
13901,bart,"you know, with the way you're treating me, why _should_ i"
13903,lisa, so here's where you're hiding!
13904,bart,yeah.  this is my only refuge from the taunts and accusations of
13906,lisa,"bart, we can't just let her get away with this."
13908,lisa, yeah?  well i eat froot loops for breakfast.
13910,marge,we really shouldn't have let them do this; it can't be helping
13912,lisa,i know most of you have already judged my brother guilty
13914,lisa,there is someone among us with a guilty conscience.  after much
13918,lisa,i am talking to the collection money thief!  only you can come
13928,bart,i just wanted to let you know that even though this was a
13930,bart,"well...don't you see, jessica, then you really haven't learned"
13935,bart,poor sucker.  it's amazing what some guys will do for a pretty
13938,bart,"ah, action news.  the last place an impressionable kid can"
13944,bart,all right!  snow day.  no school tomorrow!  [throws his
13945,lisa,that doesn't mean you don't have to do your book report.
13946,bart,"lisa, that man is a professional meteorologist."
13949,bart,you're going to eat a blizzard of... unseasonable
13950,lisa,i made the snowball from the frost in our freezer!  
13952,bart,of course she did.  who else would have?
13955,bart,i'm saved!  i love being a s-s-s-s-simpson.
13959,bart," mrs. krabappel, i didn't --"
13972,lisa, grades are all i have!  what could i be failing?
13973,marge,"lisa, your father and i are very concerned about this warning.  i"
13974,homer,whew!  that's all of 'em.   and i'm
13975,bart,"well, i _could_ use a new pair of hockey skates."
13977,lisa,that's not fair.  why is bart getting a present and i'm getting
13978,homer," ah, the mysteries of life."
13980,lisa,you mean those leagues where parents push their kids into
13982,lisa," mom, this is really scary.  i'm going to get my first f"
13983,marge,cheer up!  so you're not good at sports
13984,homer," sports, sports, sports, sports, sports,"
13985,marge, i think lisa needs to feel a little special tonight.
13987,homer,"ok son, just remember to have fun out there today.  and if you"
13992,homer,"well, boy, you won.  so i'm going to live up to my side of the"
13994,bart, how about some adulation
13995,lisa,"wow, bart, i'm so impressed you were able to give milhouse a"
13998,homer,"lisa, if the bible has taught us nothing else -- and it hasn't --"
13999,marge,"i think women should be able to play any sport men play, but"
14000,bart,"mom, will you stop showing us those?"
14001,lisa,i _have_ to join the team or i'll get an f that will haunt me
14005,lisa,he said it was just a name!
14007,homer,"ok, hotshots, now that my daughter is on your team, i want to"
14008,lisa," please, dad, i'll be fine"
14009,homer, i don't want anyone to
14012,marge, i can't even watch.  i don't know how you two
14013,homer,"we're laughing _with_ her, marge.  there's a big difference."
14016,lisa,"you really think i did ok out there, mom?"
14017,marge,"absolutely, honey.  by blocking the net, i really think you"
14019,lisa,"that's very nice, dad, but it's wrong for you to reward violent"
14024,bart," maybe i will, milhouse.  maybe i will."
14035,lisa,"don't worry, bart, they won't bother you any more."
14038,bart,"come watch tv with me, dad.  we missed the first two episodes of"
14039,homer,"aw, sorry bart, lisa and i are going out for a gelato.  we'd ask"
14041,marge,"bart, _i_ can spend some time with you."
14043,marge,don't have a stereotypical view of me just because i'm your
14046,marge,{watch out for the shaq attaq!
14048,marge,{i told you to watch out...}
14049,lisa,milhouse!  knock him down if he's in your way.
14050,homer,"wow...eye of the tiger, mouth of a teamster!  just think of all"
14051,marge,"let me give my special little winner a big, _big_ hug."
14052,lisa," ma, i think i'm all hugged out, heh...aw, one more."
14054,lisa,bart!  what are you doing in my room?
14055,bart,"lisa, certain differences -- rivalries, if you will -- have come"
14056,lisa,"bart, that was _your_ cherished childhood toy."
14057,bart,aah!  mr. honeybunny!  
14059,lisa,"bart, just get outta here."
14061,lisa,that doesn't make sense.
14062,bart,"i know you are, but what am i?"
14064,bart,"ok, but on my way, i'm going to be doing this"
14065,lisa,"ok, then i'm going to start kicking air like this.   and"
14066,marge,"oh, i better go check that out.  now homer, don't you eat this"
14067,homer,"ok... all right, pie, i'm just going to do this."
14068,marge,"stop it, stop it, stop it!  "
14069,bart,"mom, that is _really_ annoying."
14071,bart,"uh uh, lisa started it."
14072,marge,i don't care _who_ started it.  i don't ever want to see you two
14075,homer,"hey!  apu just called.  this friday, lisa's team is playing"
14087,lisa," you'll have to do better than that tonight, _chump_."
14088,homer, i asked for ketchup!  i'm eating salad here.
14089,marge,i won't have any aggressive condiment passing in this house.
14091,homer,"moe, what are you doing here?"
14093,marge,"you caught me at a _real_ bad time, moe.  i hope you understand"
14097,bart,"good luck tonight, _sis_.  i'll try not to hurt you."
14098,lisa,"don't worry, i'm wearing my lucky rabbit's head.  [pulls out a"
14099,bart, mr. honeybunny!  you inhuman monster.
14100,lisa,you want a piece of me?
14102,homer,"now that we're all alone, marge, admit it"
14104,homer,"oh, so you're a bart woman, are you?"
14106,homer,"well, you can't possibly like maggie best.  what's she ever done?"
14107,marge,"homer, we can't root for one child over the other.  you wouldn't"
14108,bart,"hey, mom!  look at me, mom!"
14109,lisa,"hi, mom!  over here!  mom!"
14114,marge,he tripped my boy!  i demand vengeance.  i want vengeance!
14116,homer,"oh my god, marge.  a penalty shot with only four seconds"
14125,marge,"oh, i've never been so proud of them."
14126,homer, they're both losers.  losers!
14133,bart,"aw, damn fda!  why can't it all be marshmallows?"
14134,lisa,"ew!  bart, don't put the non-marshmallow pieces back in the box."
14135,homer,"ooh, you like sweets, kids?  i know a place that's sweeter than"
14136,lisa,how did _you_ get tickets?
14137,homer,they hid them in every millionth krusty klump bar and krusty
14139,bart,"can i come to the candy show, huh, huh?  can i, can i?  huh, huh,"
14140,lisa,"no, me!  take me, me, me, me, me, me!  take me, me!"
14141,homer,"sorry, kids, but this is the one event i want my darling wife by"
14142,marge,"oh, well thank you, homer, but take one of the kids."
14143,homer,"marge, they can't carry enough candy!  they have puny little"
14145,bart,"you go, mom, for the greater good."
14147,marge,"homer, are all these pockets necessary?"
14148,homer,they wouldn't be if you were willing to sit in a hollowed-out
14149,marge,"oh, that's the babysitter.  no one in town will sit for you two"
14150,bart," please the hobo, please the hobo, please"
14153,lisa, ashley grant!  you gave a talk on women's issues at my
14154,bart, mom!  how can you leave us with this maniac?
14155,homer,"hurry, marge!  if we get there early we can get our pictures"
14156,marge,there's also a baby somewhere upstairs -- ooh!  
14157,bart,"so...you're one of those ""don't call me a chick"" chicks, huh?"
14158,lisa,"ehh, sorry about my unenlightened brother.  he _will_ make the"
14162,bart,"no way.   argh!  yes, 'm."
14166,homer,ooh!  i feel like a kid in some kind of a store.
14174,homer,"ooh, gummi bears!  gummi calves' heads...gummi jaw breakers!"
14177,marge,"will you two stop saying ""gummi"" so much?"
14178,homer,must have rare gummi... distract the salesman.
14179,marge,no!  i won't make a spectacle out of myself any further.
14180,homer,"now, this is going to take all my skill...heh heh heh."
14182,homer,"run, marge!  save the booty!"
14183,bart,"hey lis, i found a big caramel deposit at the small of her back!"
14185,homer,"wait a minute, wait a minute!  where's my gummi de milo?  ok,"
14186,marge, i'm sure it'll turn up!  take the babysitter home
14187,homer,"relax, marge, there's plenty for her to do in there.  [horn honks"
14188,homer,"so, a graduate student, huh?  how come you guys can go to the"
14190,homer,"aw, nobody's blaming you.  hey"
14195,homer,hey kids!  lots of candy left for breakfast.
14196,marge,why don't we give it to some needy children then?
14197,homer,oh no!  the candy conventioneers tracked us down.
14199,homer,"whew!  for a minute there, i thought i was in big trouble.  it's"
14202,homer,"marge, i swear i didn't touch her.  you know how bashful i am --"
14203,marge,"er, at any rate, i believe you and i think you should go outside"
14205,homer,"oh, that.  no, i was just grabbing a gummi venus de milo that"
14207,homer,c'mon!  i'm a decent guy.
14208,bart,why would anybody want to touch a girl's butt?  that's where
14209,lisa,"dad, i don't understand.  what is she saying you did?"
14210,homer,"well, lisa, remember that postcard grampa sent us from florida of"
14211,bart,"oh, yeah, _that_ was _brilliant_!"
14212,homer,"that's right, we _all_ thought it was hilarious.  but it turns"
14214,bart,"and the dog in the coppertone ad?  same deal, dad?"
14215,homer,"well, there's kind of a grey area."
14219,homer," it's ok, they're with me."
14220,homer,"they're ruining my whole life.  marge, please, this is where i"
14224,marge,-- i already talked to the indignation coordinator out on the
14225,homer,you mean...i'm on my own?  i've never been on my own!  oh no...on
14229,homer,mmm.  i saw that report you did on sasquatch.  it was fair and
14230,homer,"ehh, someone had to take the babysitter home.  then i noticed she"
14232,homer,"ok.  say, can you introduce me to the sasquatch?  i like his"
14233,homer,hee hee!  here comes the bouncing ball of justice!
14239,homer,somebody had to take the babysitter home.  then i noticed she was
14244,homer, marge?  kids?  everything's going to be just fine.
14246,marge,"homer, that's your solution to everything"
14247,homer,not with _that_ attitude!
14248,marge,"look, maybe this whole thing will blow over."
14249,homer,"it didn't blow over, marge.  nothing _ever_ blows over for me."
14251,homer,hey -- that's a half-truth!
14259,homer,"ooh, ""portrait""!  sounds classy.  [looks at family, who look"
14268,homer,oh...i don't have a friend in the world.
14273,homer,"oh, marge, it's a miracle."
14278,lisa,"sorry, dad, we _do_ believe in you, we really do."
14279,bart,it's just hard not to listen to tv
14280,homer,"oh, maybe tv _is_ right.  tv's _always_ right!  [walks"
14285,homer,"{oh, i like it better when they're making fun of people who"
14288,homer," ooh, i wouldn't want to be mr. t right now."
14289,marge,"homer!  homer, the kids have a great idea how you can clear your"
14290,lisa,the media's making a monster out of you because they don't care
14292,homer,"aw, but those shows all look so crummy."
14293,marge,"well we could dress it up a bit...we can bring a fern, and a"
14294,marge,there are only 49 stars on that flag.
14296,lisa,and now it's time for the innocence report with homer simpson.
14298,homer,"hello.  i am homer simpson, or as some of you wags have dubbed"
14302,lisa,"dad, you did it!  i am so proud of you."
14306,homer," aw, marge, this is so depressing, my only hope"
14314,lisa,"dad, this clears you completely!"
14315,marge,"you know, the courts might not work any more, but as long as"
14320,bart,wow!  v8 juice _isn't_ one-eighth gasoline.
14321,homer,and ted koppel _is_ a robot!
14325,homer,"oh, that man is _sick_!"
14326,marge,"groundskeeper willy saved you, homer."
14327,homer,but listen to the music!  he's evil!
14328,marge,hasn't this experience taught you you can't believe everything
14329,homer,"marge, my friend, i haven't learned a thing."
14330,homer, let's never fight again.
14335,homer,"please, marge!  how often can i see a movie of this calibre"
14336,marge,"is there something wrong, homey?"
14337,homer,no!  it's just that i've only seen this movie twice before
14340,bart,there's a ufo outside my window.  seriously!
14341,marge,"oh, bart, it's just an old golf umbrella stuck in a tree."
14342,bart,aah!  c-c-can i sleep in there with you guys tonight?
14344,bart,can i sit on the roof with a baseball bat in case a ufo
14345,marge,"yes, yes, yes, that's fine.  good, good.  "
14346,marge,"mmm, i hope you kept the homey-fires burning."
14348,marge,"homer, wake up!  wake up!"
14350,marge,we need to talk about the -- marital difficulties we've been
14351,homer,"marge, there's just too much pressure, what with my job, the"
14352,marge,i simply can't wait that long.  maybe we should get some help...
14356,homer, hey marge!  this guy looks like apu.
14357,marge,shh.  i don't want people to see us looking at these books.
14358,bart,"hi, guys.  whatcha lookin' at?"
14359,marge,um...i'm just reading up on --  --
14360,homer,"yes, and i'm pursuing my interest in --  -- aah!"
14361,marge,"this one's a good choice, and it's not too smutty.  it's a book"
14362,homer,"ooh!  ""mr. and mrs. erotic american."""
14363,lisa,"mom!  dad!  look, this biography of peter ueberroth is only"
14364,marge,"""sane planning, sensible tomorrow."""
14365,lisa,"yeah, i hope it's as exciting as his other book, ""rational"
14366,bart,"i'm getting this book on ufos.  [""unidentified flying"
14367,lisa,"oh, that's just a paranoid fantasy."
14373,marge," homey, i can't quite --"
14374,homer,faucet's jammed into my back...i'm stuck!
14379,marge,the arabian nights room looks nice.
14380,homer,"ooh, the pharaoh's chamber has a vibrating sarcophagus."
14384,marge,this isn't very erotic.  it's an actual utility room.
14389,homer,"never mind, you wouldn't understand."
14397,homer,"n -- yes!  but please, don't _you_ say that word!"
14400,homer,you're home safe.  done my duty.  see you the next time we need
14404,homer," kids!  here's $50, why not go to the movies, then take"
14405,marge,"whoa!  homey, what's --"
14406,homer,"marge, i'll explain to you afterwards."
14407,lisa,what do you think mom and dad are doing right now?
14411,homer,you want me to spend _more_ time with dad?  what about my new
14412,marge,you can make a lot of money...
14413,homer,yeah!  where are my pants?
14414,marge,you threw them out the window in a fit of passion.  you said you
14417,homer,"ooh, mama!  this is _finally_ really happening.  after years of"
14418,homer,"sir!  uh, hello sir!  yes, you look like a man who needs help"
14431,bart,"scary, no?   and _this_ guy's head"
14435,homer,great.  i'm going to be stuck in the car all weekend with that
14446,homer,they didn't start chasing us until you turned on that getaway
14447,bart,"ok, it's not _painfully_ clear the adults are _definitely_"
14449,lisa,"hey!  hey, hey, stop it!  stop it!  why are you guys jumping"
14450,bart, so what's the simplest explanation?
14451,lisa,i don't know.  maybe they're all reverse vampires and they
14454,homer,ew!  why are we stopping at this dump?
14456,homer,wow.  let's go find that hot dog tree i planted.
14458,homer,"nah, stupid cows!  nyah, nyeah, nyeah nyeah, nyeah!  [flaps"
14463,homer,"wow.   look at me, er, uh, mom"
14467,homer,"dad, how come you never gave me any encouragement?  maybe i could"
14469,homer,your whole life you never said one nice thing to me.
14473,homer,"all right, all right.  that's it"
14480,marge,"homey, are you really going to ignore grampa for the rest of your"
14481,homer,"of course not, marge, just for the rest of his life.  he said i"
14482,marge,you didn't want to have bart.
14483,homer,"i know, but you're never supposed to _tell_ the child."
14484,marge,you tell bart all the time!  you told him this morning.
14485,homer," but when i do it, it's cute."
14486,bart,"so finally, we're all in agreement about what's going on with"
14492,homer,"kids, your daddy and his daddy are involved in a very sticky,"
14499,homer,"son...my dear son, from now i'm going to be a good and attentive"
14500,bart,"number one, i know how to ride a bike."
14501,homer,"you're no girl, you're a boy.  a good boy.  you can be president"
14502,homer,i think lisa needs another push on her new tire swing!
14503,lisa,"no, dad, i want to get down.  this tire is filthy and the steel"
14506,bart,"no offense, homer, but your half-assed underparenting was a lot"
14507,homer,but i'm using my whole ass.
14508,lisa,"dad, it's just that too much of your love can really be...scary."
14509,homer, some day you'll thank me for all this scary love.  but
14510,bart,"i'm sure he meant to say, ""serious drinking""."
14514,homer,i'm a screw-up.  i burned down our house.
14518,homer,we're _both_ screw-ups.
14520,homer, so...are you going to say something nice now?
14531,homer, this is going to be great!
14538,homer,"aw, come on, everybody.  this bar is like a tavern to me."
14543,homer,"oh.  heh heh heh, joke's on them"
14547,marge,what if you pretended that this couch were a bar?  then you could
14548,homer,i'm not going to dignify that with an answer.
14549,lisa,"look on the bright side, dad.  did you know that the chinese use"
14551,homer,you're right.  i've been wasting my life away in that dump for
14557,homer,"ooh, this looks like a nice friendly place."
14566,homer,wait a minute...there's something bothering me about this place.
14571,homer, oh my god!  this man is my exact
14572,homer,the last bar in springfield...if they don't let me in
14574,homer,"shut up, liver!   ow!  my liver hurts..."
14576,homer,"um, but i _am_ a pilot."
14578,homer,um...i stowed it safely in the overhead compartment.
14585,homer,yeah.  that's exactly why i'm here.
14587,homer, but i keep telling you i'm not a
14590,homer,"uh, yeah, uh, hmm.  er, uh, as a change of pace, i'm going to let"
14596,marge,"er, i don't know, homer.  we're right in the middle of the busy"
14597,homer,"but marge, you deserve a vacation.  it's a chance for you to"
14598,marge,"i don't want to be a wet blanket, but getting on a plane like"
14599,homer,"come on, marge, i want to shake off the dust of this one-horse"
14600,homer,"so, marge, pretty sweet, eh?"
14601,marge,"hmm.  oh, i forgot to clean the lint basket in the dryer.  if"
14602,bart,"oh, great.  i specifically asked not to be seated next to a baby."
14606,lisa,"come on, bart!  they're going to pamper us!"
14608,lisa,"not _literally_, of course."
14609,bart,"i come for the service,  but i stay for the leg room."
14610,marge, i think i'll go get a picture of the plane taking off.
14611,homer,"marge, what's wrong?  are you hungry?  sleepy?  gassy?  is it"
14612,marge,"homer, i've never told you this before, but i'm not a good flyer."
14613,homer,"take it easy, marge.  how about if we dope you up real good?"
14614,marge, let me off let me off let me off let me off let me
14615,homer,"it's ok, marge.  we don't need to go on a trip; we'll just wait"
14617,bart,"you know, i have this feeling that we forgot something..."
14619,homer,"ehh, i'm sure it's nothing."
14620,lisa,"mom, are you feeling any better?"
14621,marge,"yes, but i'd rather not talk about it."
14622,homer,permit _me_ to solve the mystery
14623,bart,"so much for the days when i could say, ""at least my _mother_'s"
14624,marge,"well, everybody's got a fear of something."
14627,homer,where?!  where?!  aah!  aah!
14628,lisa,"mom, are you _sure_ you don't want to discuss it?"
14630,homer,"lisa, the important thing is for your mother to repress what"
14631,lisa,"but if we don't encourage her to vent her feelings, they can come"
14632,marge,i just realized we never had a wedding for the cat and the dog...
14633,lisa,"mom, you've been cooking all night?"
14634,marge," judge, jury, and executioner, all rolled into one, you"
14635,lisa,"see, dad, i told you mom would have problems."
14636,marge,"no, no, honey, it's all right.  really, i'm fine, i'm all right."
14637,homer,"you heard your mother's ramblings.  she's fine, so behave."
14638,homer,"marge, it's 3 a.m.!  shouldn't you be baking?"
14640,lisa,"mom, can we talk to you?"
14641,marge,can't talk.  keeping myself in a state of catlike readiness.
14643,lisa,"anyway, mom, maybe you should go into therapy."
14644,marge,"no, i don't need therapy, i'm fine.  and it's too expensive."
14645,homer,"and i don't believe in it!  it breaks up families, turns wives"
14652,homer,"now marge, ""dear abby"" says seeing films about air travel can"
14658,lisa,"dad, mom's getting worse.  you have to take her to see a real"
14660,homer," all right, lisa, you got your way.  your mom's going"
14661,lisa,"dad, i like picking beans with gramma."
14662,homer,"well, keep it up, then."
14666,homer,you'll be picking many a bean.
14668,bart,"i don't believe it!  principal skinner.  well, well, well, i"
14670,homer,"bart, leave that man alone with his pain and sit down."
14672,homer,"all right, how much do you charge?"
14676,homer,"whoa, whoa whoa whoa whoa!  first, what are your qualifications?"
14678,homer,"oh, no.  i'm not here to take a reading test.  i want to see some"
14679,marge,"mph, i'm sorry, doctor, he's just afraid you'll blame all my"
14689,marge,but it's a few seconds before 12
14691,homer,"ever since you started therapy, all you can do is talk about"
14692,marge,i just left my first session and i haven't even opened my mouth
14693,homer,"you see?  you see?  ""_i_ just left _my_ first session and _i_"
14695,marge,hmm...that would have to be my first day of school.
14699,marge, the kids at school were even worse.
14707,marge,but it's true.  they didn't write their own songs _or_ play their
14709,homer, did you talk about me in therapy today?
14711,homer,tell me the truth!   don't tell her i raised my voice.
14712,marge,"i keep having the same dream.  i'm the mother from ""lost in"
14713,marge,"ready for breakfast, dr. smith?"
14714,homer,"oh, being stuck on this godforsaken planet has vanquished what"
14715,lisa, warning.  warning.  dr. smith refuses to do his
14716,homer,"why, you clattering clank of cogs and -- my fair lady, as you"
14717,lisa,danger.  danger.  my hook are flailing wildly.
14718,marge,"wait!  wait, daddy, please don't leave.  take me with you!"
14723,marge," sure.  ok, i'll talk about father...father christmas."
14725,marge,"ok.  ok, but you're going to make a big deal out of this.  he was"
14729,marge,"wait, i'm remembering something."
14733,marge,why does daddy have to leave?
14735,marge,i want to see daddy fly.  
14737,marge,"daddy?  daddy, where are --"
14741,marge, my father was a stewardess!
14745,marge,yeah...you might even say he was an american hero.
14747,marge,do you think those things could also have contributed to my fear
14749,marge,"oh, well, thank you doctor.  you've changed my life!"
14751,homer," that's ok, you don't have to make her into some kind"
14752,marge,"thank you, doctor.  whenever the wind whistles through the"
14755,homer,"don't worry about a thing, honey.  i'm going to help you through"
14759,marge,could you start fixing it pretty soon?  the basement is getting
14763,homer,what should we do until you get back?
14766,homer,lousy traffic jams... the traffic report will get me out
14770,homer,"so anyway, lenny and carl are never around on wednesdays and they"
14771,bart,"a conspiracy, eh?  you think they might be involved in the"
14772,homer,"i do...now.  anyway, i'm going to follow them tonight and see"
14773,marge,"oh, homer, don't start stalking people again.  it's so _illegal_."
14775,marge,i don't want you stalking anyone tonight.
14776,homer,"oh, ok, have it your own way, marge.  i'll be back in a minute"
14778,homer, i can see everything and they're none the wiser!
14783,homer,"i saw weird stuff in that place last night.  weird, strange,"
14787,homer,"stonecutters, eh?  how do i join?"
14793,homer,"so one of those egg council creeps got to you too, huh?"
14796,homer,"why don't people like me, marge?"
14797,marge,"mmm, everyone likes you, you're a wonderful person."
14798,homer,why don't those stupid idiots let me in their crappy club for
14799,marge,"i'm sure it's nothing personal, homer."
14800,homer,it is.  it's been happening to me all my life.
14809,lisa," ow!  cut it out, bart!"
14810,homer,i'd give anything to get into the stonecutters.
14811,lisa,"what do they do there, dad?"
14813,homer,"what do they do?  what _don't_ they do?   oh, they do so"
14814,lisa,"you don't know _what_ they do there, do you?"
14817,bart,"dad, remember those self-hypnosis courses we took to help us"
14818,homer,do i ever!  it's five years later and i _still_ think i'm a

14829,homer,"coming through!  can't throw me out, my father's a member.  i'm"

14927,homer," lisa, you were right.  my happiness _is_ fading."
14928,lisa,you're experiencing spiritual emptiness because your power has

14956,marge,"no, the family simpson, which has just five members -- and"
14958,marge,i meant our wedding rings!

15048,homer,everything in our lives is finally perfectly balanced.  i hope

15116,homer," well, who _wouldn't_ be upset?  that new baby in"
15117,bart,"dad, you can't expect a person to sit for thirty minutes"
15118,lisa,"i'm going to get a snack, or maybe go to the bathroom."
15119,marge,"i'll stay here, but i'm going to think about products i might"
15121,homer,"oh, you're pregnant!  we're going to have to have a baby.  all"
15122,marge," bart, let your father tell the story."
15127,marge," homer, you had a head."
15129,marge,and your bottom was a little bigger.
15131,marge,you've worked hard at the bowling alley.  why don't you ask for a
15132,homer,"yeah, a raise.  i've never been good enough at any job to deserve"
15134,homer,"steve!  i mean, al!  i think i deserve a raise."
15136,homer,how about...if i _triple_ the business?  then could i get a
15140,lisa,"mom, make dad tell the story right!"
15141,marge,that's what really happened.
15143,homer, my marketing plan attracted a record number of

15147,homer,"don't worry, joey, we'll make it to california some day."
15153,homer,"actually, i quit and i came to get my job back."
15156,homer,seems like the classy thing to do would be not to call attention
15157,homer,thanks for giving me my old job back.
15163,homer,"aw, i've never been so miserable in all my life.  but i can't"
15165,homer,"aw, i can't go on with this charade any longer!  i hate my job, i"
15166,marge,my contractions started an hour ago.
15167,homer,"it's just in one ear and out the other with you, isn't it, marge?"
15173,homer," it's wonderful, it's magical, oh boy, here it"
15178,marge,"homey, i think someone is saying ""hello""."
15179,homer,"hello.  aw, it's a boy -- and what a boy!"
15181,homer,"a girl!  oh, marge, we have a wonderful baby girl.  not just a"
15183,homer,"come on, marge, show a little enthusiasm."
15184,lisa,so you loved her right from the start!
15187,homer,"oh, there are pictures.  i keep them where i need the most"
15192,bart,"go, weather balloon!  hurrah for science, woo!"
15194,bart,i don't think i really captured the eyes.
15206,bart,"empty _my_ pockets, you say?   well, certainly, but i"
15208,bart,"race you to utah, milhouse."
15216,marge,{ there's a stuffed pepper in the trash from last
15219,bart,is that the telescope we're going to be looking through?
15222,bart,why don't they look anything like their names?
15224,bart,who names these things  anyway?
15226,bart,and you've never found anything?
15229,bart,so what am i supposed to do exactly?
15250,homer,{and then i sped away without anyone seeing my license plate.}
15251,lisa,"{sounds like you had a good day today, dad.}"
15252,homer,{yeah...except i forgot to go to work.}
15253,marge,"what did you do today, bart?"
15255,marge," ""boy discovers comet""..."
15257,marge,"""a young springfieldianite has discovered a new comet to be known"
15258,bart,"but then, you've _always_ been proud of me."
15266,bart," well, i'm done eating."
15269,bart, there it is right there.
15271,bart,but you don't _need_ a stupid telescope.  it's right
15275,lisa,"don't you realize what's happening, bart?  your comet is"
15276,bart,"i knew you'd try to find something wrong with my comet,"
15290,homer,will you all stop worrying about that stupid comet?  it's going
15291,lisa,"but dad, don't you think --"
15292,homer,"uh, lisa, the whole reason we have elected officials is so we"
15294,lisa,"no, dad, i don't think --"
15295,homer,there's that word again.
15297,marge,"homer, what if this doesn't work?"
15298,homer,"well, then i have a backup plan.  see?  while the unprepared are"
15300,homer,"{i'm getting to that!  so anyway, they're going -- [twiddles his"
15302,homer,"so anyway, we get in our car and take the bridge out of town, all"
15303,lisa," dad, they're firing the rocket!"
15305,lisa,it blew up the bridge!  we're doomed.
15306,homer,it's times like this i wish i were a religious man.
15321,homer,what's everyone so worked up about?  so there's a comet -- big
15322,bart,"wow, dad, maybe you're right."
15323,homer,"of course i'm right.  if i'm not, may we all be horribly crushed"
15324,lisa,we have a bomb shelter?
15325,homer,homer simpson takes care of _his_ family.
15328,homer,get out of there.  my family needs to use your bomb shelter.
15332,marge,"get in the shelter, homer!"
15334,homer,an hour?  i can't wait another hour.  what's keeping that stupid
15340,homer,i can't get the --  -- i can't get the door closed.
15341,lisa, i'd get out but i don't know where i am.
15347,homer," uh, yeah...i can do that."
15368,marge,stop it!  stop it!  can't you see this barnyard noise
15369,homer,shut up!  shut up!  stop it!  stop it.  i can't take this any
15384,lisa,i can't believe that extra-thick layer of pollution that i've
15385,bart,"but what's really amazing, is that this is _exactly_ what dad"
15387,homer,"i know, kids.  i'm scared too!"
15389,lisa,"when krusty wants to, he can still blow 'em away."
15390,bart,"yes.  he can take a simple, everyday thing like eating a bicycle"
15419,homer, it must be the first of the month
15421,homer," ""this year, give her english muffins.""  whatever you"
15422,homer," ""best in the west.""  heh heh heh, that rhymes!"
15424,homer,that's it!  you people have stood in my way long enough.  i'm
15425,bart,i don't think any of us expected him to say that.
15426,homer,{hurry up!  it's my first day of clown college.}
15427,marge,"{hold still, homer.  don't squirm!}"
15428,homer,{ i _am_ holding still.  i _am_ squirming.}
15429,bart,"{dad, you can't just go around pretending to be krusty, it's"
15430,lisa,"{yeah, dad, it was bad enough when you tried to pass yourself off"
15431,homer,{you weren't complaining when i got you this close to chachi.}
15441,homer,ooh.  i've never had a pair of pants that fit this well in my
15450,bart,"wow, i'm sorry i doubted you before, dad."
15451,lisa,"if there had to be a bastardized version of krusty, i'm glad it's"
15452,homer,"thanks, honey.  bank shot!"
15453,lisa,"wow!  that's good aim, dad."
15454,homer,"well, it _was_ my major."
15458,homer," got it!  no shock for me, hee hee!  [runs"
15470,homer,ohmigod!  he's stealing all the burglars!  why you little --
15475,homer," and then, take that...and..."
15477,homer,that's the spirit.  never give up.
15479,bart,"ehh, i have a feeling i could get him to appear at my house."
15483,homer,"whew, i'm beat.  and after work i've got to dedicate a new jiffy"
15486,homer,"yeah.  when i started this clown thing, i thought it would be"
15488,homer,and now the winner for the most promising new series on
15492,homer,"er, can't, i gotta go distract bulls at a rodeo."
15494,homer,"um...no, i'm going a different way than you, dick."
15496,homer,"look, you're going to be having dinner with groucho tonight"
15497,homer,"aw, being a clown sucks.  you get kicked by kids, bit by dogs,"
15503,homer,"hey, he didn't give me a ticket!  this is an intriguing"
15504,homer, you mean i get five percent off on everything in the
15506,homer,"i'm telling you marge, this will work.  they'll think i'm"
15507,marge,"i'm not saying it won't work, i'm just saying it's dishonest."
15508,homer,"well if we agree, then why are we arguing?"
15510,bart,i'm more striking than lovely.
15530,homer, i want a free car because i'm krusty.
15532,homer,i want everything that's coming to krusty the klown.  which
15537,homer," hey, what are all these holes?"
15539,homer,"oh, yeah.  speed holes!"
15546,homer,"aw, putting speed holes in my car.  makes it go faster."
15550,homer,but wait...you can't kill me for being krusty the klown.  i'm not

15563,homer,"oh, but i've never been able to do that --"
15567,homer,"krusty!  oh thanks, thanks a lot.  you came here to save me!"
15572,homer,"heh heh.  good one, krusty."
15583,bart,"go, toothpaste, go!  move your pasty white butt."
15584,lisa,"come on, shampoo!  you can do it!"
15585,bart,no fair!  you only won because you had the inside track.  if the

15591,marge,"[walking into upstairs bathroom, seeing bart pushing the water"
15592,lisa,"bart, water will only go the other way in the southern hemisphere."
15593,bart,"what the hell is the ""southern hemisphere""?"
15594,lisa, haven't you ever looked at your globe?
15595,lisa," see, the southern hemisphere is made up of everything"
15596,bart,"hmm.   so down there in, say, argentina, or...[reads"
15597,lisa,"uh huh.  in fact, in rand mcnally, they wear hats on their feet"
15599,bart,"hello, southern hemisphere?  which way does the water go in your"
15603,bart, which way does the water turn in your toilet?
15606,bart,i can't get a straight answer out of this crazy hemisphere.
15610,lisa," bart, you can't actually _call_ these places."
15611,bart," hello, operator?  i'd like to make a collect call to"
15613,bart," uh, yes.  uh, ahem, this is dr. bart simpson"

15644,bart,"this is bart simpson.  can i help you, ma'am?"
15648,bart, i don't think so.  you're all the way in australia.
15654,bart,nothing.  some stupid country thinks i owe them money.
15655,lisa,"uh oh.  bart, you better talk to mom and dad about this."
15656,bart," hey, guys?  just so you don't hear any"
15657,homer, that's no reason to block the tv.
15660,marge,"bart, did you trick an australian boy into accepting a $900"
15664,marge," ""undersecretary for international protocol"
15666,lisa,"i know those words, but that sign makes no sense."
15670,homer,"oh, he'll agitate you.  ho, ho!  he sure will."
15672,homer," that's tough but fair.  boy, go with the man."
15673,marge," no, no, no!  no!  i'm not going to have my"
15676,homer,all bart has to do is apologize and we get a free trip to

15712,homer,no.  it's pretty big...i guess.
15713,marge,i'll just have a cup of coffee.
15721,marge,"we'll meet you boys back here for dinner.  good luck, honey."
15722,lisa,"bart, i'm sorry i'm going to miss your public humiliation, but"
15732,homer,what kind of a sick country would kick someone with a giant
15734,homer,"you sold us out, conover!  "
15737,bart, hey!  we can get away in their pouches.
15738,homer,"yeah, there's a lot more mucus."
15739,lisa,"mom, you said i could have one souvenir, right?  well i want the"
15740,marge,"mmm, that seems very noisy and expensive for a souvenir.  mmm,"
15743,marge,we have them in america.  they're called bullfrogs.
15745,marge,i can't believe our government would set up bart like that!
15748,marge,"oh, for the love of criminy!  gimme that.  "
15756,marge,"no deal!  this is my son we're talking about.  sure, he's not"
15758,lisa," thank you, bart.  i promise i won't make fun of you later"
15759,homer," show 'em what american butts are made of, son."

15763,marge,"i'm glad you're ok, honey, but i wish you'd chosen a more"
15764,lisa,i'm impressed you were able to write so legibly on your own butt.
15765,homer,"hey, do we get to land on an aircraft carrier?"
15767,homer,"hey, look!  those frogs are eating all their crops."
15768,lisa,"well, that's what happens when you introduce foreign species into"

15780,homer,"all right, let's not panic"
15781,homer,"oh, how am i going to tell marge we're broke?  i need a"
15785,marge,this is a special occasion.  patty and selma just got
15787,homer,"all right, that's the last straw"
15792,marge,i wish you wouldn't put homer down like that.  he may not be a
15793,homer," oh, sweet, trusting marge, i can't let you down."
15794,homer,if only i could think of an invention...something that would

15798,homer,"but, uh, could i just --"
15800,homer,"lemme see, lemme see!  out of the way!"
15801,marge,"homer!  homer, wake up!  there's still a few minutes till our"
15802,homer,"oh, my invention!  all our money problems could have been --"
15803,marge,"money problems?  homer, are we in some sort of fiduciary trouble?"
15804,homer,"oh, marge, my loyal wife, of course not."
15805,bart,ratboy?  i resent that.  
15806,marge,"bart, i told you before, stop gnawing on the drywall."
15807,bart,"what a day, eh, milhouse?  the sun is out, birds are singing,"
15809,bart,"so, uh...what's your hurry to get to school?  "

15855,homer,time to fertilize the lawn; a couple of 500 pound bags should do
15856,marge,homer!  be careful of my sisters' heads
15859,marge,what's that supposed to mean?
15863,marge,this has been such a nice peaceful dinner.  it calls for a

15899,homer,"no!  don't tell marge.  i'll be good, i'll be good!"
15905,marge, what's going on in here?
15906,homer," absolutely nothing, marge!"
15909,marge, homer!  is this projection accurate?  did you borrow
15910,homer,"i don't know, marge, i can't be expected to keep track of all my"
15913,marge,"homer...homer, why didn't you tell me?"
15914,homer," i was ashamed, marge.  i've failed you as a husband and a"
15917,marge,"not too good, lisa.  frankly, he's underneath the table."

15920,homer,"oh, in that case i'll just have french toast with double butter"
15921,bart,"see that?  i started to do, like, a little arabesque, but then"
15923,bart,dance in front of the whole school?  what is it with you and

15926,lisa,"hey, dad.  whatcha doin'?"
15927,homer,daddy has very important work to do.  he's looking through
15928,lisa,"dad, that's a gag paper we got at the carnival."
15929,homer,oh.  no wonder i didn't hear about bart being elected world's
15931,homer,that's it!  i'll make money with a chauffeur job.  good thing
15932,lisa,"i didn't turn it on, i thought _you_ turned it on."
15933,homer,"no.  well, anyway, turn it off."
15939,lisa,that spiky-haired masked dancer is really something.  i wonder
15942,homer,"oh, wow!  i can't believe my very first passenger is comedy"
15944,homer,hey!  let's do that 2000-pound man thing.  i'll be that carl

15963,bart, they love me; i'm accepted.  i don't need this mask
15967,bart,go ahead and laugh.  but i took a chance and did something i

15973,bart,{why'd she just leave me here when i clearly need medical

15976,homer,"oh, ok marge, i'll get along with them.  then, i will hug some"
15978,homer,"look, all i ask is that you be fair."
15981,homer,"you won't be happy until my family thinks i'm a loser, will you?"
15984,homer,nagging the driver.  minus ten points for you!
15986,homer,being a jerk.  minus a million points!
15993,marge," so, homer, how'd you do?"
15998,homer, i am in flavor country.
16003,homer,"please, on top of everything else, don't make me picture your"
16004,marge,that's a wonderful thing you did for my sisters.
16005,homer,"i didn't do it for them...i did it for _you_, marge.  i'd kill"
16006,marge,"no, homey.  you see?  you see, this is the stuff i've been"
16013,homer,"debt's off!  let's go, marge."
16030,lisa,this is terrible!  people will start to avoid springfield.
16031,homer,but what can i do?  i'm just... one
16032,marge,i think we should call a town meeting.  if we don't do something

16041,bart,"{i may be just a boy, but i have an idea.  if i may, i'd like"
16045,marge,"i'm marge simpson, and i have an idea."
16047,marge,"now, i know you haven't liked some of my past suggestions,"
16051,marge,but my new idea's different.  i think we should hold a film
16057,marge,"you like my idea?  actually, i have several others --"
16061,bart,"hello, i'm bart simpson.  in the past, i've bought you such"
16062,homer," ""relaxed fit"", my aunt fanny!  stupid"

16381,marge,maggie!  don't talk with your mouth full.
16382,homer,me and bart will take you out on the town this afternoon.
16383,lisa,hugh should take it easy because of his fall.
16385,homer,great.  there's only one thing i ask in return.
16393,homer,"hugh, there's something i want you to have.  my dad gave me his"
16396,marge,"you know, fox turned into a hardcore sex channel so gradually, i"
16397,homer,"marge, it's so great to have the whole family together under one"
16398,lisa,"all right, dad!   i'm sorry i left you alone with homer"
16400,lisa,how did you get that gash on your forehead?
16402,lisa,"oh, you are so good to put up with all of this."
16405,marge,"lisa, i can't _believe_ it's your wedding day already."
16406,lisa,"mom, i feel kind of funny wearing white.  i mean...milhouse."
16407,marge," oh, milhouse doesn't count."
16408,lisa,"ok, i've got something old, that's my pearl necklace, something"
16411,bart,"wow, lisa, looking at you makes me want to get married for a third"
16412,lisa,hugh didn't have a bachelor party.
16413,bart,we had one in his honor.
16415,homer, you know what's great about you english?
16425,homer,"you look great, sweetheart."
16427,homer,"little lisa, lisa simpson.  you know, i always felt you were the"
16429,homer,"no, no, let me finish.  i just want you to know i've always been"
16431,homer,see?  you're still helping me.
16432,lisa," hey dad, did you forget to give those"
16435,homer,"i found them on the nightstand this morning and...well, i guess"
16436,lisa,but you've been going on about these all week.  i'm sure he just
16438,lisa,what about _my_ family's tradition?  
16440,lisa,but you promised my dad you would.
16442,lisa,i know they look a little silly but his feelings will be hurt if
16445,lisa,are you saying we won't see my family again?
16447,lisa,i can't believe i'm hearing this.  i don't want to cut my family
16449,lisa,that's a horrible thing to say!
16451,lisa,"maybe, but i still love them!  and i don't think you understand"
16462,lisa,"wow.  now that i know all this, isn't there any way to change the"
16464,lisa,i thought you said you'd tell me about my _true_ love.
16466,homer,"lisa, lisa!  where were you?  you missed the most incredible"
16468,homer,i ate seven pounds of fudge!
16470,homer,the man at the stand said it was a record.
16471,lisa,"wow!  what else did you do, dad?"
16472,homer,"i rode the teacups, then i got a little sick and i had to sit"
16475,marge,"all right, who broke my vase?"
16476,lisa,who took all my test papers off the refrigerator and tore them
16477,homer,who spread garbage all over flanders' yard before i got a chance
16478,bart,"oh, please.  this is senseless destruction with none of my usual"
16479,lisa,"if it wasn't you, then who was it?"
16480,marge,"well, i'm sure these things didn't destroy themselves, now, did"
16482,marge,i think there's really something wrong with santa's little
16485,homer," my ""best of ray stevens featuring `the streak'"""
16487,homer,oh my god!  he's got the precious cable tv cable!
16492,marge,"excuse me, we're having a problem with our dog."
16494,marge,"no, no!  our dog is out of control"
16496,homer,"well, problem solved.  "
16497,marge,homer!  hold on to the wheel.
16501,bart,look!  he's headed back to the greyhound racing track where we
16502,homer,"don't worry, as soon as they find out he doesn't have any money,"
16503,marge,"ooh, this place is so big.  do you think we should split up and"
16504,homer, two bucks to win on number eight.  [sees
16505,homer,we can't lose!  look at the name of the dog i bet on.
16506,marge,"""she's the fastest""...homer, i don't think that means"
16508,homer,"you're lucky you got looks, marge."
16510,homer,"yes!  come on, you little horse!"
16512,bart,it's santa's little helper.
16514,lisa,what's santa's little helper doing to that dog?
16516,bart,"it looks he's trying to jump over her, but he can't quite"
16519,marge,i think they're in love.
16521,homer,"aw, so _that's_ what's been wrong with the little fellow"
16522,lisa,"can we keep santa's girlfriend, mom?"
16526,marge,won't you miss her loyalty and companionship?
16528,marge,"ok, you can go out and play, but no more you-know-what in front"
16530,bart,"hey, boy, you want to play fetch?"
16531,marge,"bart, don't ever say that word again!"
16532,bart,"well, that's what she is.  i looked it up."
16533,marge,"well, i'm going to write the dictionary people and have that"
16536,bart,{an army of dogs!  no bully will ever touch me again.
16539,marge,"oh, homey, aren't they adorable?"
16540,homer,"yes.  we've waited many years, but the good lord has finally"
16542,lisa,"mom, why do _i_ have to wear a flea collar?"
16543,marge,"oh, it's just easier this way."
16544,marge,"yeesh, this house stinks!  you're not just putting the new"
16545,homer,do you have a better idea?
16546,marge,"now, i know we love the puppies very much, but i think"
16547,bart,"yeah, they ate all my socks.  i have to wear lisa's to school"
16548,homer,"how do you explain the coulottes, boy?"
16549,bart," well, i have to coordinate, don't i?"
16550,homer,your mother and i have been thinking about giving the puppies
16553,lisa,is that what we do in this family?  when someone becomes an
16555,marge,"all right, we'll give the dogs one more chance.  as long as"
16556,homer,splendid!  who's coming?
16557,marge,"reverend lovejoy, your old army drill sergeant, and the"
16571,lisa,they don't like being broken up.
16572,marge,"we've got to be realistic, kids.  who's going to have a big"
16575,lisa," mom, don't give the puppies to him, he'll be mean"
16576,marge,"hmm...she's right, homer.  there's something about his face i"
16577,homer,"uh, i'm sorry, mr. burns, but...you can't have these dogs."
16579,marge,"my, he certainly took that well."
16580,homer,"a little too well, if you ask me.  i'm sure he's plotting some"
16585,marge,"dogs!  chief, you're getting powdered sugar all over my floor."
16606,lisa,he's going to make a tuxedo out of our puppies!
16607,bart,"sorry.  you gotta admit, it's catchy."
16609,lisa,"no, bart!  what are you doing?"
16610,bart,dogs always land on their feet.
16612,bart,"no, it's dogs.  i'll prove it."
16614,lisa,quick!  let's get the --
16616,bart,that's impossible.  how did you get here first?
16618,lisa,but they're ours.  you stole them from us!
16623,lisa,"well, mr. burns, i hope you've realized the folly of killing"
16626,marge,"homer!  for the love of god, no!"
16627,homer," marge, you know that batting this lightbulb is the"
16630,bart,"well, at least it's safer than the old bus."
16651,bart,it's hard to see what's going on; i can only make out the fat
16661,bart,"uh, i think i got your lunch."
16663,lisa,"oh yeah, i didn't think this was for me."
16671,lisa,"i've never seen them fight like that, bart.  i'm worried that all"
16678,bart,i saw you two fighting...i'm worried there could be a strike
16680,bart,yeah...skinner says you wouldn't have the won tons to go
16682,bart,"well, i had to clean it up a little."
16684,bart,yeah.  she said you'd fold faster than superman on laundry day.
16700,marge,"bart, lisa, what are you two doing home so early?"
16703,bart,"the school's on strike, maybe forever!   oh, overload,"
16704,lisa,"luckily i've prepared for this, so i'm not too worried."
16707,marge,"bart, leave that crowbar here.  you know i don't like you prying"
16713,bart,"you, with the crane!  spin around real fast!"
16715,homer,"lousy teachers, trying to palm off our kids on us!"
16716,lisa,"but, dad, by striking, they're trying to effect a change in"
16717,homer,"lisa, if you don't like your job, you don't strike"
16718,lisa,i've got some textbooks but without state-approved syllabi and
16719,marge,"honey, maybe you should relax a little."
16720,lisa,"relax?  i can't relax!  nor can i yield, relent, or -- "
16722,homer,"well, it's always in the last place you look."
16726,bart, now for operation strike-make-go-longer.
16732,bart,milhouse!  i found a hive of killer bees.  you wanna go throw
16740,lisa," grade me...look at me...evaluate and rank me!  oh, i'm"
16741,marge,"i'm worried about the kids, homey.  lisa's becoming very"
16742,homer, i know.  and this perpetual motion machine she made
16743,marge,and bart isn't doing very well either.  he needs boundaries and
16746,homer,"i'm with you, marge.  lisa!  get in here."
16776,bart,"in my weaker moments, i almost pity them.  then i just remind"
16780,marge,"hi, class!  hi bart...over here, sweetie.  it's me, mom.  hi!"
16783,marge,"well, i'm sure some of you already know me.  i'm bart"
16790,marge,"oh, kids have been doing that one since my day."
16791,homer," so, how was everybody's day at school?"
16794,marge,exhausting.  it took the children forty minutes to locate canada
16795,homer,"marge, anyone can miss canada, all tucked away down there."
16796,lisa,"well, _my_ teacher's a nightmare.  three kids got sick from"
16798,lisa,there's no way i'll get into an ivy league school now.  at this
16799,homer,"i've had just about enough of your vassar-bashing, young lady!"
16800,bart,"look, mom, it feels really weird having you on my turf.  how"
16801,marge,i'd be thrilled.  you can start right now.
16803,marge,"and i'm going to keep teaching your class, like it or lump it."
16804,bart,"well, then, i guess i'll just have to get into the crawlspace"
16805,marge,i hate it when he gets in there.
16808,bart,"mom, i need a dollar.  ever since you started teaching here"
16809,marge,"mmm, here you go precious.  now, go off with your friends."
16811,bart,why isn't my mom stopping this?
16813,marge,"that's a very nice jig, kearney.  now isn't dancing much more"
16815,bart,"that's it, i can't take this any more, milhouse.  i've got to"
16817,bart,"zuh?  wait!  that's it!  with your booksmarts, and my ability"
16820,bart,and you're not coming out until you reach an agreement!
16838,bart, i'm surprised he doesn't try to blame his problems on
16840,marge,"bart, are you ready for your history test?"
16841,bart,"oh, you bet, mom!  ask me anything."
16842,marge,ok.  who was george washington carver?
16843,bart,um...the guy who chopped up george washington?
16845,marge,"bart, you said you were going to study."
16847,marge,"mmm, you just don't want to take that test."
16849,lisa,"mom, i think he's serious."
16850,homer,"kids are so naive.  lisa, when you get to be our age, you'll"
16851,bart,"mrs. krabappel, i can't take the test.  i have a stomach ache."
16853,bart,"look, if you ignore me and i die, you'll get in a _lot_ of"
16855,bart,"""no teacher shall be held accountable if bart simpson dies."""
16858,bart,"mrs. krabappel, i'm done failing the test.  can i _please_ go to"
16860,bart, lunch lady doris?  why are you here?
16863,bart,"look, my stomach really hurts."
16871,homer," man, these are primo seats.  i could"
16872,marge,homer!  this is an operation.
16879,marge,how's my special little guy?
16880,lisa,"how're you feeling, big brother?"
16882,bart," no thanks to _you_, homer."
16887,bart,"wicked!   i got this cool scar, _and_ i get"
16892,lisa,it's been a long time...
16894,lisa,ew.  how did you get a name like that?
16899,lisa,my brother just had his appendix out.
16901,bart," hello, i'm dr. cheeks.  i'm doing my rounds, and,"
16905,lisa,what about your family?
16908,lisa,it must be awful to be all alone in the world.
16920,lisa,when was the last time you worked?
16928,lisa,"wow, you've had some career, although the moral seems to be that a"
16939,lisa,"lift me, won't you lift me above the old routine?"
16948,lisa,"hey, bleeding gums!  i was great, and i owe it all to --"
16950,homer,"lisa, honey, are you going to be ok?"
16951,lisa,bleeding gums was my hero and i never got to tell him how i felt.
16952,homer,"oh, i'm sure he knew, and i'm sure that wherever he is now, he's"
16953,lisa,but he was the only person that had the same love for music that
16954,homer,"well, it's like the time that your cat snowball got run over."
16958,homer,"what i'm saying is, all we have to do is go down to the pound and"
16961,bart,"hey, lis, you still upset about that jazz guy?"
16963,bart,"if it helps, i believe that after you die, you come back as"
16965,bart,"because, nobody _ever_ suspects the butterfly.  "
16968,lisa,"uh, maybe i need to talk to somebody with a little more age and"
16976,lisa,"that's maggie again, grampa."
16978,lisa,how come it won't stop hurting?
16979,marge,"oh, lisa, it's normal to be sad when a friend dies, and bleeding"
16980,homer,"lisa, honey, if you really want to preserve his memory, i"
16982,lisa,isn't anybody going to show up?
16984,lisa,no!  it was bleeding gums murphy.
16986,lisa,saxophone!  he was a jazz musician.  you didn't know him --
16987,homer,and i won't rest until i've gotten a hot dog.
16988,marge,"homer, this is a cemetery."
16991,marge,"what do you do, follow my husband around?"
16996,bart, what kind of legal fees?
16999,bart,how much of the hundred thou do i get?
17006,lisa,"mom, i want to honor bleeding gums' memory but i don't know where"
17007,marge,maybe you could get the local jazz station to do a tribute to
17008,homer,"jazz, pfft.  they just make it up as they go along.  i could do"
17010,marge,"that's ""mary had a little lamb""."
17012,marge,"that's the same thing; you just replaced ""dee""s with ""doo""s."
17014,lisa,"hi, i have a request.  i would like you to do a tribute to"
17016,lisa,what if i could find it?
17018,lisa,"gee, your station has a lot of problems."
17021,lisa,$250?  but i need that album to honor the memory of bleeding gums
17024,bart,"excuse me, my good man, i have $500 to blow.  what have you got?"
17027,bart,lisa...look what i've got.  ta da!  
17028,lisa," bart, i can't believe it!  but why?"
17029,bart,"when i said my stomach hurt, you were the only one who believed"
17030,lisa,"oh, thank you.  but $500?  you'll never see that much money again."
17031,bart,oh yeah?  take a look at this.
17033,lisa,"that was for you, bleeding gums."
17040,lisa,i don't want you to go.
17047,lisa,"i got a date with billie holiday.""  the gracie films music is"

17049,homer,peh.  they're butchering the classics.  could that bassoon have
17050,marge,"aw, come on, homer, there's lasers.  you like lasers..."
17051,homer,"laser effects, mirrored balls...john williams must be rolling"
17053,homer,"whoa, careful now.  these are dangerous streets for us upper-"
17055,homer,woo hoo!  easy money!  
17056,marge,"homer, these games are fixed."
17057,homer,then how come that guy's winning?
17061,homer,"twenty on this one, my good man.  "
17065,marge,it's people like _you_ who are ruining our downtown promenades
17071,marge,"uh, i think i'm ok.  it was scary, but...in a weird way, it was"
17072,homer,"yes, it _is_ exhilarating to see the police get their man and"
17073,marge,"oh, for crying out loud --"
17074,homer,"easy now, sweetheart, homey's here."
17076,lisa,"hey mom, is this how you caught him?"
17077,bart," face it, lis, you're too puny to -- aah!  ow!"
17079,marge,"lisa, unhand your brother."
17080,bart,"yeah, like that really hurt.   oh..."
17081,lisa,"mom, was catching that guy _the_ most incredibly exciting thing"
17082,marge,"well, it _was_ pretty exciting...but celery soup's pretty"
17091,marge,"uh, actually, i'm interested in becoming a police officer."
17094,bart,i borrowed your nail clipper.  what's the big deal?
17095,homer,nothing.  i'm just a little edgy since your mother told me she
17096,bart,cool!  will you bring me along when you do evictions?
17097,marge,"you got it, little buddy!"
17098,homer,"marge, you being a cop makes you the man...which makes me the"
17099,marge,"homer, there's no reason for you to feel threatened.  you'll"
17109,bart,"wow, mom, i never pictured you as any kind of authority figure"
17110,homer,"marge, i want you to take care of yourself out there.  you've"
17111,marge,"oh, homey, of course i will."
17112,lisa,"mom, if someone shot at the mayor, would you have to throw"
17114,bart,what if they shot at a coke machine?
17118,bart,tv with a picture of the mayor on it?
17119,lisa,"whatever you do, mom, we'll be proud of you."
17121,lisa,as long as it's constitutional.
17122,marge,"mmm.  homer, give me my pepper spray!"
17123,homer,"oh, marge, one squirt and you're south of the border!  [eats"
17128,marge,"i just wanted to say ""hello""."
17132,marge,"$200.   no, no!  i mean, nothing!  i don't take"
17137,marge,{i got a report on a domestic disturbance at this address.}
17139,marge,{uh huh.  who called the police?}
17141,marge,"{look, why don't you two settle down?  i'm sure you can get"
17144,lisa,"so mom, what are you going to do with your day off?"
17145,marge,i just want to relax and forget that i'm part of that thin blue
17147,marge,it's for your own safety.
17153,marge,"don't stop talking on account of me.  i may be a cop, but i'm"
17155,marge,moe!  i've never seen you here before.
17157,marge,"you don't have to call me ""officer"", i'm not on duty here."
17158,marge,"oh, heh.  looks nice, it's, er, it's a good length for you."
17159,lisa,"mom's police tape isn't a toy, dad."
17160,homer,"shush, dear.  you'll wreck daddy's fun."
17162,homer," fooled you, flanders!  made you think"
17166,homer, but you thought they were!
17168,homer,that's why it was so funny.  
17170,marge,and that's the drunk tank --
17172,marge,-- and this is mommy's desk.
17173,lisa,"mom, i know your intentions are good but aren't the police the"
17174,marge," look lisa, it's mcgriff, the crime dog!  [uses a hand"
17176,homer," ""the girls of the internet""...ooh, i'd go on-line"
17181,homer,are you kidding?  being a cop husband is one mighty sweet deal!
17183,homer," hey, hurry it up with the cards, lenny"
17185,homer,"all the more reason for you to hurry up.  hey, what could be"
17186,marge, illegal gambling in my house?
17190,homer,"marge, you chased away all my poker buddies!"
17192,homer,"oh, you've become such a cop.  and not that long ago you were so"
17194,marge,"i'm still all those things, only now i'm cleaning up the city,"
17195,homer,you're cooking what for dinner?
17196,marge," everywhere i look, someone is breaking the law.  dog,"
17197,homer,"hey, marge.  how's my little piglet?"
17199,homer,"heh heh, that's ok, i'm supposed to be working too.  "
17200,marge,you have to move your car.
17201,homer,"i'll just be a second, marge, i'm going to get some beer for"
17202,marge,"i'm going to pretend that i didn't hear that, but you have to"
17203,homer,i'll be right back.  now keep your eyes peeled for a real cop.
17205,homer,but marge!  we're family.
17206,marge,you're breaking the law.
17209,homer,"ooh, what are you going to do about it?  what are you going to"
17210,marge,you have the right to remain silent.
17211,homer,i choose to waive that right.  
17214,homer,let me just finish this last lobster tail and raspberry tort.
17220,marge,"i'm sorry i had to arrest you, homer, but what i did was right."
17221,homer,"i have nothing more to say to you, marge.  i'm drawing a line"
17222,homer,"boy, when marge first told me she was going to the police"
17224,homer,"all right, guys, pipe down.  i got some more in the garage."
17226,homer,hmm.  i wonder why he's so eager to go to the garage?
17228,homer,well what do _you_ call it?
17235,homer,"hey herman, i had to come out here to see what's so funny."
17239,homer," herman, how could you?  we've all thought about"
17241,marge, i don't think that's a very good
17243,marge,"no, it's officer simpson of the police."
17244,homer,"herman, your beef is with me!  leave the girl out of this."
17247,homer,"it's too late for me, marge!  sell the jeans and live like a"
17250,homer,"oh, marge, you saved my life!  i'm sorry i teased you.  you are"
17252,homer,"he's getting away!  you blew it, marge."
17256,homer,"marge, how did you know --"
17257,marge,that the pants would rip?
17258,homer,"no, what i was wondering was --"
17259,marge,years of buying pants for two active children and a full-seated
17261,homer,"yes there is, there's a garage full of counterfeit jeans."
17263,marge,that's it.  there's too much corruption on this force.  i quit.
17268,bart," ""wet cement""!  is there any sweeter sign?  well, maybe"
17282,marge,"bart, you've graffito-tagged public property!"
17284,marge,"i can't believe you vandalized your own hometown, bart.  what"
17285,bart,i think he'd be cool with it.
17286,marge,"oh.  homer, will you please help me make a big deal of this?"
17287,homer,what for?  nobody cared when bogart defaced that sidewalk in
17288,marge,"well, i'm just shocked by this whole family.  whatever happened"
17289,lisa,it's been going downhill ever since the lake caught fire.
17290,marge,now just a darn minute.  this town is a part of who you are.
17291,bart,"mom, when you give that lecture, you're boring springfield."
17292,marge,"bart, you have roots in this town and you ought to show respect"
17293,marge, this town is a part of us all.  a part of us
17296,bart,"beautiful, aren't they.  "
17298,bart,"hey, milhouse!  how's the lemonade business?"
17300,lisa, i don't even want any.  i just bought a pity glass.
17302,bart,"you know, milhouse, i've been thinking"
17304,bart,"hey!  stop talking bad about my town, man."
17306,bart,"i don't make trash, i burn it."
17308,bart,"well, i know _you_ are, but what am i?"
17310,bart,"i know _you_ are, but what am i?"
17312,bart,"i know you are, but what am i?"
17320,bart,that's a crud rock.  it belongs in crudtown.
17322,bart,hey!  they're taking our lemons.
17339,bart,"those shelbyville kids think they're so hot, but you know"
17349,bart,we got to get that tree back.
17351,bart,"that lemon tree's a part of our town, and as kids, the"
17352,marge,"{where are you going, bart?}"
17353,bart,"{mom, you won't believe this, but something you said the other"
17355,bart,"{and now, i am going to teach some kids a lesson.  }"
17356,marge,{i choose to take that literally.}
17357,bart,{ death to shelbyville!}
17358,homer,"{yes, bart's a tutor now.  tute on, son!  tute on.}"
17369,bart,they're getting rich off us!
17371,marge,it's almost lunch time.  do you know where your brother is
17372,lisa,pfft.  tutoring?  the only thing bart's teaching is guerilla
17373,marge,"well, do you have a number where we can reach him?"
17374,lisa,"no, mom, bart and some kids ran off to wage war on shelbyville!"
17375,marge, homer!  come quick!  bart's quit his tutoring job and
17377,bart,"good idea.  milhouse, you and me will be omega team.  todd,"
17384,marge,"this is my fault.  i tried to teach bart about town pride,"
17385,homer,"now, marge, you can't blame all of bart's problems on your"
17386,marge,isn't there anything we can do?
17387,homer,"yes there is!  come on, everybody, let's go into shelbyville"
17391,homer,"pile in, everybody.  no time to wipe your feet."
17402,bart,"hello, there, fellow shelbyvillians."
17409,bart,curse those handsome devils!
17414,bart,"no, not in my mouth!  ...uh, is what that kid would say.  to"
17424,bart,"you know, bart simpson?"
17428,bart,i'll use these spray cans as jet packs and fly to safety.  so
17430,bart,uh...hey look!  someone's attractive cousin!
17435,bart, milhouse!  what's seven in roman numerals?
17447,bart,"keep your voices down, boys"
17448,homer, found 'em!  you kids are in _big_
17449,bart,but they stole our lemon tree.
17450,homer,i don't care what excuse you've got.  _nothing's_ going to
17451,homer,that tree's been in springfield since the time of our
17455,homer,this is the darkest day in the history of springfield.  if
17456,bart,"there's got to be a way to get that tree back...hey, look!  a"
17457,homer,"aah!  oh, great, now i'm upside down."
17465,bart,"eat my shorts, shelbyville!"
17492,homer," here's your package, mr. burns."
17494,homer," oh, i've worked here for ten years and my boss doesn't"
17520,lisa,i'd like to start a jazz program for the music department.
17522,lisa,he's ready to give up the drudgery of the professional mambo
17540,marge,i'm happy for the school.  it sounds like this money's going to
17541,bart,big deal.  they didn't approve my idea; they said it was
17542,lisa,"it _is_ unfeasible to resurrect the dead, bart.  and even if the"
17543,bart,oh yeah.  i guess they'd probably want to be with their families
17544,homer,"oh, i hate my job.  i mean, what's the point when your boss"
17546,homer,what?  what's your idea?
17547,marge,"when my father was first trying to catch my mother's eye, he sent"
17548,homer,"that's all well and good, but it's not really _your_ idea, is it"
17571,bart,"i'll get even with whoever did this to you, boy, i swear it."
17582,lisa," oh no, that's awful, mr. puente.  what?  oh, he owns"
17583,homer,"well, he's not all bad.  he did send me this nice thank-you card."
17584,lisa," ""marge, bart, lisa, and maggie.""  dad, this doesn't"
17585,homer,"kids, would you step outside for a second?"
17606,marge,"i must say, mr. burns is being awfully inconsiderate -- selfish,"
17607,bart,"burns needs some serious boostafazoo, right dad?...dad?...homer!"
17608,lisa,"sorry, grampa.  it's just that for a second it looked like dad"
17610,marge,"strained carrots for maggie, strained carrots for grampa."
17619,homer,shut up!  homer simpson!
17621,homer,my name is homer simpson!
17629,marge," aah!  bart, put that down!  guns are very dangerous"
17631,marge,i'm going to bury it in the yard where little hands can't get to
17644,lisa,he robbed the school of music!
17647,homer,he can't remember my name!
17648,marge,he's causing us all to yell!  
17649,bart,look what he did to my best friend!
17651,bart,you twisted old monster!
17668,marge,i don't think we'll ever know who did this.  everyone in town's
17680,lisa,"everyone in springfield had a reason to shoot mr. burns, even us."
17682,bart,aren't we forgetting someone...sister suspect?
17683,lisa, i was just getting to me.  because of mr.
17690,homer," kids, kids, kids.  as far as daddy's concerned,"
17691,marge, the police already have a suspect
17693,lisa,we don't have an outhouse.
17694,homer, my toolshed!  oh dad --
17697,homer,sure.  i've had it up to here with these damn rickets!
17739,marge,i guess it's never the most likely suspect.
17740,lisa,"actually, mom, in 95% of cases, it is.  the rest of the time,"
17741,homer,hey!  i had a damn good reason.  he could never remember my name.
17745,homer,my name is homer simpson...
17746,lisa,well i don't think anyone in this family is capable of attempted
17748,lisa,nancy drew says that all you need to solve a mystery is an
17749,marge,mmmmm...i think you're a little young to be investigating an
17750,bart,who wants chocolate ice cream?
17753,lisa,mr. burns is the richest man in town.  maybe it's about money.
17757,lisa,my name is lisa simpson and i made a chart of all the suspects
17761,lisa,dedicated educator principal seymour skinner
17766,lisa,"well, he _did_ vow revenge, heh heh.   but i can't see"
17791,marge,"grampa, i found your cigar box dug up in the back yard but the"
17793,marge,i was just asking if you'd seen it.  there's no need to be a
17795,marge,"{are you talking to me, grampa?}"
17814,lisa,"hey!  chief wiggum, what are you doing?  what's going on?"
17817,bart," dna, positive id -- those won't hold up in any"
17819,homer,"i swear, i've never seen that gun before!"
17838,marge,the police have such a strong case against homer.  mr. burns said
17839,lisa,"they have simpson dna!  it could have come from any of us, except"
17840,marge,"no!  no, no, when i took your father's name, i took everything"
17842,lisa,"anyway, my point is, the evidence isn't as concrete as it seems."
17844,lisa,are you sure you don't want me to hold one of your ice cream
17845,homer," pfft.  yeah, right.  you chose fruit,"
17846,lisa,and we don't even know whose gun that was!  maybe somebody
17847,marge,"no, we can't start thinking that way about our own family"
17853,homer,"so, you finally learned my name, eh?"
17855,homer, i've got no time for your demented parlor games.
17859,lisa,stop!  don't shoot my dad.  he's innocent.  he wouldn't hurt a
17861,homer,stop telling them it was me!  i'll kill you for saying it was me.
17869,lisa,"then, with your last ounce of strength, you pointed to w and s..."
17871,marge,"well, i'm just relieved that homer's safe and that you've"
17876,bart,"ohh, all these new superheroes _suck_!  none of them can hold"
17878,bart,"nah, he's just a cheap imitation of radioactive man."
17880,bart,"the similarities are subtle, but many.  for example,"
17882,bart,"while radiation dude has a similar but lamer catch phrase, ""up"
17884,bart,"well, between us we've read all 814 issues of ""radioactive"
17910,bart,"look behind you, radioactive man!  the sun is exploding again!"
17911,marge,"bart, why are you talking like that?"
17912,homer,"yeah, and who the hell are you talking to?  marge, do you have"
17913,bart,"i'm practising my fallout boy dialog.  if i get this role, i can"
17918,homer,which one were you?  the ugly one?
17946,bart,"watch out, radioactive man!"
17948,bart,"watch out, radioactive man!"
17950,bart,"watch out, radioactive man!"
17955,bart,i have _got_ to grow an inch by tomorrow or i won't get that part.
17956,bart,"ohh, i only grew half an inch.  i'm still too short."
17957,marge,"growing half an inch in one day is still pretty good, bart."
17958,lisa,"yeah, that's how fast grampa's shrinking."
17960,bart,is there any way i can look taller without actually being
17974,bart,"ohh, i just missed out on the greatest opportunity of my entire"
17976,lisa,"cheer up, bart.  milhouse is still going to need a true friend,"
17977,bart,"you're right, lis.  i can suck up to him, like the religious"
17978,homer,"guess what, kids?  they're going to pay us $50 a day to film"
17980,homer,"careful, now --  hey!  didn't you direct"
17982,homer," phew-ee!  woo!  oh!  you know, i never"
17996,bart,"hey, milhouse.  i want you to know that i'm glad at least one of"
17999,bart, there's the _real_ milhouse.
18000,bart," hey, you're not milhouse."
18004,bart,"hey.  cool, milhouse!  you get to be crushed by a truck."
18017,homer,you guys work on the movie?
18019,homer,"oh, i always wanted to be a teamster.  so lazy and surly..."
18026,bart,"wow, you really got it made now, milhouse.  this is living!"
18058,bart,have you seen milhouse?
18069,bart,"but milhouse, being a star is every patriotic american's"
18073,bart,"but milhouse, they haven't cured anything!  heart disease and"
18076,bart,"wow, spanning two decades."
18093,bart,"so, milhouse, it must be a little tough giving up all that"
18096,marge,"here's your toast, maggie!  i melbafied it myself."
18097,lisa,"wow, mom.  you didn't have to go to _this_ much trouble."
18098,marge,"oh, it was no trouble.  the hobos at the dump were very"
18100,marge,"bart, it's class photo day.  no dracula fangs!"
18101,bart,but they told us to wear them.
18104,lisa,"mom, you fuss over us _way_ too much."
18105,marge,"enjoy it now, because when you're a grownup you'll have to take"
18106,homer," marge, there's a spider near my car keys."
18107,marge,you did the right thing by telling me.
18109,homer,"now that we're alone, papa bear has a little honey for his"
18110,marge," ""good for a three hour getaway at"
18112,homer, what advantages does this motor car
18115,marge,"homey, this is so sweet, but i can't possibly go now.  the sink"
18116,homer,"oh, we'll clean up this afternoon."
18118,homer,i got my dad to look after her.
18120,marge, yee!  don't _do_ that!
18123,marge,"hmm.  uh, all right, but i'm taking something to iron with me in"
18128,bart,"hey, how come i get lice and nothing happens to milhouse?"
18135,lisa,"hey, come on!  those are prescription shoes.  i _need_ them."
18141,marge," mmm...this is so relaxing.  homey, this was a"
18142,homer," yeah.  if that mafia guy weren't staring at us,"
18156,lisa,i don't know.  they should be here.
18158,homer," ah, i love getting away from this dump."
18159,marge,it's like i'm on some wonderful drug.
18164,marge,"mmm!  ""squalid hellhole""?  ""toilet paper hung in improper"
18165,marge,what are you doing with my children?
18167,marge,what?  no!  no -- you can't -- i won't let you --
18175,bart, uh...please don't hug me.  it sickens me.
18178,lisa,you don't understand.  mom and dad take good care of us.
18180,marge," ""parents are not to communicate"
18181,homer,we leave you the kids for three hours and the county takes them
18183,marge,i can't believe i put my own pleasure ahead of my home and
18184,homer,"oh, marge, don't blame yourself.  _i'm_ the terrible parent.  the"
18192,lisa,"yeah.  it seems like our house, but everything's got a creepy pat"
18195,bart,"watch ""itchy and scratchy""!"
18203,homer,i can see lisa...but it might be a starfish!  i gotta call them.
18206,marge,that's it.  we're going downtown to get our kids back -- right
18207,marge,"we've always tried to be good parents.  please!  i'm begging you,"
18209,homer,"well, wait a minute!  ok, i'm not going to win ""father of the"
18211,homer,"who?  lady, you got the wrong file."
18213,homer,"oh, maggie.  er, i got nothing against maggie."
18219,homer,i have listening skills!
18222,bart,i never heard maggie laugh like that before.
18223,lisa,"well, when was the last time dad gave her that kind of attention?"
18224,bart,"when she swallowed that quarter, he spent all day with her."
18225,lisa,"i thought i could ride this thing out, but everything's just too"
18226,bart,i know.  they put honey on pancakes instead of maple syrup.
18227,lisa,"they read ""newsweek"" instead of nothing."
18231,marge,"and then i saw my boy in a burlap sack, and they told me he had"
18239,marge,this is so humiliating.

18243,lisa,"yeah, the sun is still out."
18248,lisa,"you know, maggie hasn't been a simpson as long as us.  i think"
18249,bart,remember how mom used to microwave our underwear on cold days?
18250,lisa,or the way used to call the radio station with fake traffic?
18251,marge,it's so quiet here without the kids.
18252,homer,what i wouldn't give to hear lisa play another one of her jazzy
18253,marge,"i miss the way bart would say something, and then say ""dude""."
18254,homer,i wish i knew something about the baby i could miss now.
18260,homer,why you cotton-pickin' -- 
18283,lisa,"um, ahem, actually, you see, ahem, we were never baptised."

18297,homer,kids!  we're good parents now.  get your asses out here!
18298,marge,we've missed you so much.
18299,homer,"oh, no!  in the eyes of god they'll be flanderseseses."
18302,bart,"ha ha, you're going to be lisa flanders!"
18303,lisa,you're going to be _bart_ flanders.
18306,bart,that's because she can't talk.
18308,marge,where are we going?  where are we going?
18309,homer,"ok, ok, don't panic.  to find flanders, i just have to think like"
18311,bart,"wow, dad, you took a baptismal for me.  how do you feel?"
18312,homer," oh, bartholomew, i feel like st. augustine of hippo"
18314,homer,"i said shut your ugly face, flanders!"
18316,marge,so what was it like at the flanders' house?
18317,homer,"yeah, gimme all the dirt."
18318,lisa,"let's see.  dirt....dirt...well, there wasn't really much dirt."
18319,bart,"there was a bunch of old paint cans in the garage, though."
18322,bart,"hymns, here!  i got hymns, here.  get 'em while they're holy."
18325,homer," hey marge, remember when we used to make out to this"
18329,bart, ...where my soul will be chopped into confetti and be
18334,bart,you shank!  how could you tell on me?
18336,bart,"soul?  come on, milhouse, there is no such thing as a soul."
18339,bart,"well, if your soul is real, where is it?"
18341,bart,uh huh.  what if you die in a submarine at the bottom of the
18343,bart," oh, how can someone with glasses that thick be so"
18369,bart,"oh, lisa!  there's a little present for you lying in the driveway!"
18371,lisa,waah!  no!  it's dripping funny-smelling water all over me.
18372,bart, i wasted five bucks on these.
18373,lisa,where'd you get five bucks?  i want five bucks.
18374,bart,"aw, i sold my soul to milhouse?"
18375,lisa, what?  how could you _do_ that?  your soul is the

18377,lisa,"well, whether or not the soul is physically real, bart, it's the"
18378,bart," poor, gullible lisa.  i'll keep my crappy sponges,"

18393,homer," i got it!  ""madman moe's pressure cooker""!"
18398,homer,forty seconds?  but i want it now!
18399,bart,"i know that's funny, but i'm just not laughing.  "
18400,lisa,"hmm.  pablo neruda said, ""laughter is the language of the soul."""
18401,bart,i am familiar with the works of pablo neruda.
18402,lisa,i think we should do a test.
18403,homer," oh, doo doo doo.  oh, i'm just walk --"
18405,bart, nope.  i don't feel a thing!
18406,lisa,"that's creepy, bart.  i think you really _did_ lose your soul."
18410,homer,help me -- ow!  why isn't anybody -- ow!
18415,bart," uh, you know, milhouse --"
18417,bart,"bet you're getting tired of that soul, huh?"
18419,bart,suppose someone wanted to...buy it from you.
18429,marge,"hmm.  bart, what's wrong?  there's something a little off about"
18430,bart,"mom, i need to tell you something.  i kind of --"
18431,marge, let me guess.  a mother can always tell.
18432,bart, like i don't have a soul?
18433,marge," aw, honey, you're not a monster."
18434,marge, an alligator with sunglasses?  hah!  now
18436,homer,"wow, that's moe -- the guy from the ad!"
18439,marge,"street signs?  indoors?  ha ha, whatever!"
18447,lisa,how are the southwestern pizza fingers?
18456,lisa,i would like to say grace.  ahem.
18458,bart,"i can't _take_ this any more.  i want my soul, and i want"
18459,homer,"bart, you didn't finish your spaghetti and moe balls!"
18461,homer," run, boy!  run!  run for your life, boy!"
18463,bart,milhouse...milhouse!  you win.  i want this nightmare to end!
18468,bart,"oh.  when milhouse left, did you notice if he was carrying a"
18494,bart,"yes.  a simple proposition, ralph"
18496,bart,all you have to do is sign a paper that says i can have your

18510,bart,"milhouse, i've _got_ to have my soul back.  i'll do anything"
18515,bart, you traded my soul for pogs?!
18519,bart,"please, you have something of mine on a little piece of paper."
18526,bart," are you there, god?  it's me, bart simpson.  i know i"
18527,lisa,with the change in my piggy bank.
18528,bart,there's no change in your piggy bank.
18529,lisa,not in any of the ones _you_ know about.
18531,lisa,"happy to do it.  but you know, bart, some philosophers believe"
18541,lisa," we're going to storytown village, grampa.  it's an"
18544,marge,i think it's nice we're doing something maggie will enjoy for
18547,bart,what a load of crappy crap crap.
18548,homer,"quiet, boy.  i have a feeling some bad stuff is going to go down."
18549,marge, this is where the wolf blows down the pigs house.
18550,bart," he blows all right, he blows big time."
18551,marge,"that's it honey, get into the spirit."
18552,homer,"that was good, but not great."
18557,homer,"come on, eat the can!  come on!"
18558,marge,you're supposed to feed them pellets from the machine over there.
18559,lisa,"ooohh, you are so cute, yes you are you are i just love you."
18560,marge, see.  it was a good idea to come here after all.
18566,homer,ned!  you're having a family reunion and you didn't invite
18571,homer,i can't believe you didn't invite me.  
18574,homer,"this barbeque will be hard, thankless work.  but i'm sure you're"
18575,marge,"well, it could be a good chance to get to know our neighbors"
18576,homer,you know what you should serve marge?  more of these lamb chops.
18577,marge,"why, thank you homey!  you might say the secret ingredient is..."
18579,marge,"what's wrong, lisa?  didn't you get enough lamb chops?  [places"
18580,lisa,i can't eat this.  i can't eat a poor little lamb.  [pushes her
18581,homer,"lisa, get a hold of yourself.  this is lamb, not _a_ lamb."
18582,lisa,what's the difference between this lamb and the one that kissed
18583,bart,this one spent two hours in the broiler.  
18584,marge,"bart!  sensible bites!  all right, lisa, if you don't want lamb"
18585,lisa,no i can't!  i can't eat any of them!
18586,homer,"wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute.  lisa honey, are you"
18591,lisa,dad!  those all come from the same animal!
18592,homer," yeah, right lisa.  a wonderful, magical animal."
18594,lisa,"ohhh, my family just doesn't understand my new found"
18602,lisa,why does it talk like a lamb?
18603,lisa,"uhh, miss hoover?  i don't think i can dissect an animal.  i"
18605,lisa,"uhh, excuse me?  isn't there anything here that doesn't have meat"
18607,lisa,"well, i believe you're required to provide a vegetarian"
18609,lisa,  do you remember when you lost your passion for this
18612,lisa,"i never realized before, but some itchy & scratchy cartoons send"
18613,bart,"they what?  cartoons don't have messages, lisa.  [moves toward"

18619,homer,all normal people love meat.  if i went to a barbeque and there
18620,bart,  you don't win friends with salad!
18622,marge,"{i don't mean to take sides, i just got caught up in the rhythm.}"
18642,lisa,they can't seriously expect us to swallow that tripe.
18644,lisa,stop it stop it!  don't you realize you've just been

18681,lisa,"bart, tell dad i will only pass the syrup if it won't be used on"
18682,bart, you dunkin' your sausages in that syrup homeboy?
18683,homer,"marge, tell bart i just want to drink a nice glass of syrup like"

18976,homer,"no, it would only worry her.  if you want to add to her worries,"
18979,lisa,obesity is really unhealthy; any doctor will tell you that.
18980,homer,oh yeah?  well we'll just see about that little miss smart
18982,homer,can you recommend a doctor who will?

19097,homer,what are you talking about?
19099,homer,i can sit in the aisle.
19102,homer,shame on all of you.  give me my dignity!  i just came here to
19104,homer,"this may surprise you, but you can't buy me off with food.  i'm"
19112,homer,"i'm going to have to shut it down myself.  fat, don't fail me"
19113,homer,"hey, buddy, you got to let me in your car --"
19116,lisa,"hey, my dad may have gained a little weight, but he's not some"
19119,homer,"get away, damn it!  run for your lives!"
19122,homer,"let go, i've got to get to the tank!"
19125,lisa,i think it's ironic that dad saved the day while a slimmer man
19126,bart,and i think it's ironic that for once dad's butt prevented the
19142,homer," hey, everybody!  up here!"
19144,homer,"right away, mr. smithers.  i'll just walk across these"
19155,bart,"that dummy worked like a charm, dad."
19156,homer,"best 600 bucks i ever spent.  come on, boy"
19160,marge,what are you talking about?
19162,marge,what?!   that's ridiculous!  homer's not dead.
19170,marge,"get out of here, you ghouls!   ay-yi-yi-yi-yi."
19174,marge,"when i asked you if that dummy was to fake your own death, you"
19175,lisa,{mom!  dad!  bart ran into a doorframe and bit his tongue.}
19176,bart,{ what the hell's going on heah?}
19179,homer,"i don't like your attitude, you water-cooler dictator.  what"
19183,homer," ""uh, your youngest daughter"".  well how about"
19185,homer,"mom, i'm sorry i never come to see you.  i'm just not a"
19188,homer,"i hate to rain on your parade, lady, but this is _my_ grave"
19190,homer,i thought you were dead!
19196,homer,some people say i look like dan aykroyd.
19198,homer,"{yeah.}  well, where have you been all this time?"
19200,homer,"ma, there's something you should know about me"
19202,homer,"hey, everybody!  i've got a big surprise for you!"
19204,lisa,this is so weird.  it's like something out of dickens...or
19205,bart,"where have you been, granny?  did they freeze you or something?"
19207,marge,i don't know what to say
19208,bart,"hey, since you were a no-show at all the big moments of my"
19212,homer,"this is my room, and this is my dresser.  it's where i keep my"
19214,homer," you remembered.  oh, i've missed moments like this..."
19216,lisa,"aw, i just keep them out to bug bart, heh."
19219,homer," hey, mom!  look at me!  look at what i"
19221,lisa,"shyeah, more like preschool."
19224,homer,mom!  you're not looking!
19226,lisa," you didn't dumb it down!  you said ""rapport""."
19228,lisa," there, now no one should be able to hear us."
19230,lisa," all right, we don't need the dryer."
19232,lisa,just shut up and listen!  there's something fishy about grandma
19233,bart,"yeah, i don't trust her either.  when i was going through her"
19234,lisa, mona simpson...mona stevens...martha stewart...penelope
19235,homer,woo hoo!  i'm so glad to have my mom back.  i never realized how
19238,marge,i just don't think you should get too excited about the woman who
19239,homer,"first, it wasn't 25 years -- it was 27 years.  and second, she"
19241,homer, i dunno.  i guess i was just a horrible son and no mother
19242,marge,"oh, homey, come on.  you're a sweet, kind, loving man.  i'm sure"
19243,homer, then why did she leave me?
19245,marge,"mother simpson, we'd like to ask you a few questions about your"
19247,bart,"spill it, muddy mae, or we're calling the cops!"
19249,lisa,"all right, then we'll call your husband grampa!"
19252,homer,"""take out wrenched ankle."""
19254,homer," sing me my bedtime song, mom."
19263,marge,"so mother simpson, where did your newfound sense of"
19281,homer, i thought i dreamed that kiss.
19282,marge,"i'm so sorry i misjudged you, mom.  you had to leave to protect"
19285,homer,{wait a minute...} there's one thing i don't understand.  in
19287,homer,"aw, come on, mom, we use that same line on the kids when"
19289,homer,any undelivered mail for homer j. simpson?
19310,lisa,"no, dad, it's a rhetorical question."
19311,homer,"rhetorical, eh?  eight!"
19312,lisa,"dad, do you even know what ""rhetorical"" means?"
19313,homer," do i know what ""rhetorical"" means?!"
19328,lisa,"you know, grandma, i used to think that i was adopted.  i"
19345,lisa,"grandma, have you ever thought about moving back to"
19346,homer,you could live with grampa again.
19349,homer,"mom?  there's nothing to be alarmed about, but...could you"
19358,homer,it's all thanks to our anonymous tipster.
19362,homer," yak, yak, yak, yak, yak!"
19364,homer," at least this time, i'm awake for your goodbye."
19373,homer,pfft.  that sideshow mel think's he's so big.  whatever happened
19374,lisa,don't you remember dad?
19375,bart,and he tried to murder me.
19376,homer, oh yeah.  but what i'll mainly remember is the
19391,lisa,i want to meet the first female stealth bomber pilot.
19392,bart,i want to see some birds get sucked into the engines.
19393,marge,this year i'm making ear plugs out of biscuit dough.
19400,bart,"way to guard the parking lot, top gun."
19409,marge,five tires!?  am i seeing things?
19413,homer,free duff!?  viva life!
19420,bart,look at that hunk of junk.
19422,bart,so how do you know so much about american history?
19429,homer,they didn't have any aspirin so i got you some cigarettes.
19430,marge,mmm.  maybe my headache will go away once the show starts.
19437,marge,do they have to play that rock music?  every note is pounding
19442,lisa,dad!  why aren't you looking?
19443,homer,"heh heh, why jerk my neck around like a goon when tyrranno-"
19450,homer,"go back to massachusetts, pinko!"
19453,marge, kids!  everything's gonna be ok!  don't panic!  just
19454,lisa,mom.  mom!  you're stepping on my heels and knocking my shoes
19455,marge,we can always get more shoes!  move!  move!  move!
19457,bart,hey!  cool!  i want to be around when those guns start going off.
19458,marge,"wait!  wait, my children are in there!"
19463,lisa,bart.  bart!  what are you doing?  we've got to get out of here.
19464,bart,target sighted.  launching air-to-nerd missile!
19465,lisa,"owww!  come on, mom and dad are waiting!"
19477,homer,"ok, so we can't go over the fence."
19478,marge,i feel so helpless.  what if something happens to them?
19479,homer,"i'm sure they're fine, honey."
19480,marge,"well, at least they're wearing clean underwear."
19481,bart,"free and easy, lis...aaah.  there's nothing like an unfurnished"
19482,lisa,"huh?  hurry up, mom and dad are probably worried sick."
19485,lisa,"high-toned voice...bart, that's it!  i know where sideshow bob is"
19486,bart,"tight, binding underwear?"
19487,lisa,helium!  sideshow bob is in the duff blimp!
19496,lisa,don't you see?  that would be taking the easy way out.
19500,bart,"so, krusty double crossed you.  but your basic plan was pure"
19502,bart,i...should have known you were too smart to fall for that.
19513,homer,"hang on, boy!  daddy's coming to save you!"
19514,lisa,mom!  i found sideshow bob's hideout and i got a secret message
19515,homer,"well, i wrecked the gate, but you don't hear me bragging.  now"
19517,bart, are you getting lots of bugs in your mouth too?
19527,bart,"get out of the way, krusty!"
19534,bart,but -- but -- but -- mom!  you're embarrassing me in front of
19551,homer," hello, my name is mr. burns.  i believe"
19556,marge,"well, homer, maybe you can take some consolation in the fact that"
19557,homer," ooh, look at me!  i'm making people happy!  i'm the"
19565,homer,"hey, guys!  look what i smuggled aboard!  "
19569,homer,i'll take care of this...
19578,homer,"""no tv and no beer make homer"" something something."
19619,homer,"oh, sorry.  here's another one."
19629,homer,"no, i work at the nuclear power plant."
19631,homer,"well, you'll be happy to know i don't work very hard.  "
19634,marge,"lawyers, lawyers, lawyers...oh!  lionel hutz.  ""cases won in 30"
19635,bart,i'd sell my soul for a formula one racing car.
19637,bart,changed my mind.  sorry.
19638,marge,bart!  stop pestering satan.
19648,bart,this movie you rented sucks.
19649,homer,"no it doesn't, it's funny!  their clothes are different from my"
19651,homer,"bart, you're coming home."
19652,bart,i want to stay here with mr. burns.
19654,homer,"or what?  you'll release the dogs, or the bees, or the dogs"
19670,lisa,"then, with your last ounce of strength, you pointed to w and"
19672,marge,"well, i'm just relieved that homer's safe and that you've"
19685,lisa,"hey, i thought krusty was jewish."
19686,bart,christmas is a time when people of _all_ religions come together
19691,lisa," hmm, that looks entertaining."
19694,bart,buy me bonestorm or go to hell!
19696,homer,"young man, in this house, we use a little word called ""please""."
19697,bart,it's the coolest video game ever!
19698,marge,"i'm sorry, honey, but those games cost up to and including $70."
19699,bart,"those are all good points, but the problem is they don't result"
19700,homer,"i know how you feel, bart.  when i was your age, i wanted an"
19701,bart,"ohh, i'll never get that game."
19703,bart,"mom, i'm not a little kid any more!  tuck-in time is lame."
19704,marge,"well, if loving my kids is lame, then i guess i'm just a big"
19705,bart,"mom, it's lame to be proud of being lame."
19706,marge,"well, life is like a box of chocolates --"
19709,marge,-- what you're going to get --
19710,bart, i want to buy a copy of bonestorm.
19712,bart,"oh, then may i please rent it?  please?"
19715,bart,milhouse has bonestorm!
19717,bart," say, cool dude, can i play too?"
19719,bart,"then how come it says ""second player score""?"
19721,bart,"hmm.  maybe if i stand next to the games looking sad, someone"
19726,bart, that must be the happiest kid in the world.
19729,bart,are you guys shoplifting?
19738,bart,i'm outside.  i got away with it.  i'm free!
19740,bart,uh...i don't think this is the kind of coat that opens.
19752,bart, i could pay for the game.  i'll pay for it!
19756,bart,"um, ok.  i've really, really, _really_ learned my lesson.  can i"
19759,bart,"everything except ""capisce""."
19760,homer," hmm, we didn't have a message when we left."
19762,homer,"marge, is lisa at camp granada?"
19764,marge,"homer, didn't you get any milk?  all i see is egg nog."
19765,homer,"'tis the season, marge!  we only get thirty sweet noggy days."
19766,lisa, i think i'm having chest pains.
19767,marge,"bart, get your suit on."
19769,marge,we're getting our christmas picture taken.
19770,bart,"ehh, you lucked out, marge, my man, 'cause i'm in a smiling mood"
19771,marge," well, good!  so get ready, and before you know it, we'll"
19773,marge,"ah, my teapots are ready."
19780,marge," bart, what's taking so long?  if you're having that"
19782,marge,what's the matter with your face?  is that a fake nose?  are you
19783,bart,i don't have to listen to these wild allegations!
19784,marge,"please, bart, no more pranks.  it would mean so much to me if we"
19785,homer,"hey, i don't remember saying that!"
19786,marge,"uh oh, almost forgot to lock the doors."
19789,bart, so we're just going to do this photo and get
19790,lisa,"i want to look at the pets, and write things on the typewriters,"
19792,homer,"i want to price some flip flops, and smell the new tires, and"
19793,marge,"sure!  we're going to have a great day.  budda bing, budda boom,"
19794,homer,uh oh...somebody's got tired little legs!
19796,marge,"oh, homey, look at that watch.  i've always wanted a watch like"
19797,homer," well, maybe someone will give you one for christmas."
19799,homer, now she'll _really_ be surprised when she opens that
19801,marge,"oh, wait!  wait, i don't want maggie's face hidden behind that"
19804,homer,what are you doing to my son?
19806,marge,that's crazy.  bart's not a shoplifter
19808,marge,"my son may not be perfect, but i know in my heart he's not a"
19809,marge,"fine, play the tape.  then everyone can see you've got the wrong"
19810,bart," wait!  mom, i don't want you to see this."
19813,homer,how _could_ you?!  haven't you learned anything from that guy who
19815,bart," mom, i'm _really_ sorry."
19817,bart,is there anything i can do?
19818,marge,i don't know.   why don't you go to bed?
19820,bart,"man, i thought mom was going to scream me stupid.  she didn't even"
19821,lisa,"i admit i haven't known mom as long as you have, but i know when"
19823,bart, really?  you think _this_ might be one of those
19826,marge, lisa's on a sleepy train
19828,marge,"good night, sweetheart.  "
19829,bart,"oh, great.  the tuck-in express is right on time."
19831,homer,"i've figured out the boy's punishment.  first, he's grounded.  no"
19832,marge,"i always thought i understood my special little guy, but"
19833,homer,"ehh, what are you going to do?"
19834,marge, mmm.  he's not my little baby any more.  maybe i mother
19835,bart," hey, mom, you didn't wake me up."
19836,marge,here's your hot chocolate.
19837,bart, you didn't put my marshmallow in.
19838,marge,i think you're old enough to do it yourself now.
19841,bart,milhouse...do you ever worry that your mom might stop loving
19843,bart," yeah, that was pretty good.  hey, how come"
19845,bart,"yeah, right.  you're just trying to trick me because you don't"
19847,bart,no.  let me try the cup and ball.
19849,bart,"come on, don't be a cup and ball hog!"
19851,bart,"ok!  i won't bug milhouse.  but...well...mrs. van houten, this"
19852,bart,who are dan and sherrie adler?
19854,bart,"oh.  and, who is warren burke?"
19859,bart,"oh, hey!  that's mom.  she's happy again!"
19861,bart,why didn't you wait for me?
19862,marge,i didn't think you'd mind.  i figured you were getting a little
19868,lisa," mom, this fake snow is making me"
19869,marge,we're almost finished.  there's just a little bit of green left.
19870,marge,there you are.  you can help me spray the cookies!
19872,marge,"oh, bart, not again.  give it to me!"
19873,bart,"i told you, i don't have anything!  "
19874,marge,"you can't hide from me in this house, bart.  i spend 23 hours a"
19875,homer," hee hee hee.  get 'im, ma."
19876,marge,"there's no place left to run, bart.  hand it over."
19878,bart,i wanted to surprise you for christmas.
19879,marge,"oh, sweetie, this is the best present a mother could get."
19881,marge,"since i got my present early, i think you should get yours early"
19882,lisa,bart got a present early?  then i should get a present early!  i
19883,marge,"lisa, you have to wait."
19884,lisa, this is the worst christmas ever.
19885,marge,"now i know you love video games, and i asked the clerk which is"
19898,homer,"ooh, ""snappy answers to stupid questions""!  i'm great at these."
19899,bart,does something smell funny in here?
19900,homer,i don't think so...stupid!  
19901,marge," homey, you want pork chops?"
19902,homer,"no, i want roast beef, you clod!  "
19904,marge,hmm.  those magazines create a dangerous amount of laughter.
19907,homer,"aw, they never come around any more now that they've got their"
19911,homer," well, you're closing, it's getting late, my kids are"
19916,homer,"well, i'm tired of being a wannabe league bowler.  i wanna be a"
19917,homer,hey!  we could be a team...
19919,homer," uh, that longhaired freak's bowled with us for"
19922,homer,"$500?!   oh, no problem.  will you take an out-"
19923,marge,"no, i will _not_ pay you $500 for sex!"
19924,homer,"aw, come on, marge!  you're getting something in return, and i'm"
19925,marge,it's sick!  and i don't have that kind of money to spend on sex.
19926,homer, burns never gives money to anybody.  just last week i
19928,homer,"oh, i gotta get the third degree from you too?"
19941,bart,how do you know it's from mad?
19948,homer,"uh...excuse me, mr. burns?"
19950,homer," ow!  heh, mr. burns?  i, er, was"
19952,homer,"woo hoo!   hey, everybody"
19965,homer,"come on, guys!  let's be the team that supports each other."
19969,homer,"domo arigato, mr. roboto."
19973,homer,"let me set the scene for you, marge."
19977,homer,the hardest shot in bowling.  it was all up to me --
19979,homer,"-- so i got up all my courage.  right away, my lips started to"
19980,marge,who knocked down the pins?
19981,homer," i don't know.  you know, some guy, er...otto, i guess."
19983,homer,"yes, but -- marge, you're not -- you're missing the point!  the"
19984,marge,i can't believe otto picked up a 7-10 split -- he's phenomenal!
20001,bart," mom, my slingshot doesn't fit in these pockets."
20002,marge,bart!  where do you pick up words like that?
20003,homer," yeah, moe, that team sure did suck last night."
20004,marge,homer!  watch your mouth!
20005,homer,"aw, i gotta go.  my damn weiner kids are listening.  [hangs"
20007,homer,then what are you dressed like that for?
20009,homer,"""oh, they made us.""  that's loser-talk!  you gotta start"
20025,homer,you want to join my _what_?
20030,homer,"look, guys, it's not that simple"
20032,homer,welcome aboard!   it wasn't any easier.
20038,bart, oh.  there's something i used to do in
20053,lisa," now you are the one who is ""it""."
20058,bart,"wow!  look at all the colors, man!"
20059,lisa,"red, green, yellow, orange!  i remember all of these."
20066,homer,"oh, marge, we were so close to winning the championship.  now,"
20067,marge,"homer, maybe mr. burns will bowl a great game, and you will win"
20068,homer,so you're saying...we're definitely going to win?  woo hoo!
20074,homer,"either burns goes, or moe goes."
20077,homer,"oh, uh...mr. burns?  as team captain, it's my duty to inform you"
20088,homer,woo hoo!  we won!  we won!
20092,homer,"i guess some people never change.  or, they quickly change and"
20096,homer," ohh, saturday afternoon tv is so boring."
20108,marge,why don't you read something?
20109,homer,because i'm trying to _reduce_ my boredom.
20110,marge,"well, you could hand out these flyers for the neighborhood"
20111,homer,"ehh, i'll do it anyway.   come on, boy"
20112,homer,good old evergreen terrace
20113,bart,"well if you love it so much, why are you always littering?"
20118,homer,hey!  i never noticed _this_ place.
20119,bart,"dad, it's right across the street from us!  that fancy house'll"
20120,homer,"hey, what's wrong with this neighborhood?   big"
20121,bart,"who are you talking to, homer?"
20122,homer,the guy who doesn't live there.
20123,marge,can we get rid of this ayatollah t-shirt?  khomeini died years
20124,homer,"but, marge!  it works on _any_ ayatollah"
20125,marge,i don't care _who's_ consolidating their power.
20126,homer, marge!  that's the rhinestone nights fashion gun.  i
20128,homer,"oh, er, i wanted to write ""disco stud"" but i ran out of space --"
20133,marge,"are you interesting in that motorized tie rack, principal"
20135,marge,"well, you can always take the motor out and use it as an"
20142,homer,"uh, hey, ned, let me help you with that."
20145,homer," say, that ayatollah thinks he's better"
20147,homer,"and, for the man who has everything, a tie rack motor!"
20151,homer,speeend some dough at table three.
20152,homer,"thank you, neighbors!  thank you.  now, let's give it up for"
20156,homer,"ok, let's give it up for the new guy.  now, let's all turn"
20158,bart,"wow, a former president living right across the street."
20159,homer,"oh, why did he have to move in on _my_ territory?  look at him."
20160,lisa,"actually, this _is_ one of the nine states where mr. bush claims"

20518,bart,i can't believe krusty is really gone.
20519,homer,"don't worry, son.  i'm sure he's in heaven right now laughing it"
20525,homer,"don't let krusty's death get you down, boy.  people die all the"
20526,bart,"mom, i just saw krusty!"
20527,marge,"yes, dear, in your mind."
20529,marge,on the street in your mind.

20531,marge,"sweetheart, sometimes when people die, you just want them to"
20532,bart,"dr. hibbert, who was that man?"
20536,lisa,"bart, you're seeing krusty everywhere because you want to tell"
20538,lisa,"well, i can't.  you'll just have to learn to live with your"

20544,bart,how about krusty the klown?
20546,bart,"well, if you're not krusty, how come you have the exact same"
20548,bart,"well, now that we've blown your cover, i guess you gotta come"
20552,bart,"but, krusty, what about all the kids who depend on you to"
20554,lisa,what about the great feeling you get from knowing you're better
20555,bart,what about being an illiterate clown who's still more respected
20558,bart,"so, krusty, what are you gonna do about your tax problems?"
20568,lisa,how about town crier?  you'd be great at that.
20570,bart,"well, yeah, dad, you're a big fat loudmouth and you can walk"
20572,lisa,"hi, i'm lisa simpson.  i'm researching a report on jebediah."
20574,homer,"you su-diddely-uck, flanders! "
20585,lisa,it's just the excitement from studying jebediah.
20587,lisa,just as i was getting over my chester a. arthritis.
20590,homer," hear ye, hear ye!  what's for breakfast!"
20592,homer,"i don't understand thee, marge."
20595,lisa,jebediah springfield was really a vicious pirate named hans
20596,homer,"no tongue, eh?  how did he talk and eat  and"
20597,lisa,he had it replaced with a prosthetic tongue made out of silver.
20604,lisa,but it explains why there's no record of jebediah springfield
20606,lisa,"okay, i'd like 25 copies in canary, 25 in goldenrod, 25 in"
20611,homer,but i'm just waiting for my kid.
20612,lisa,"hi, apu.  can i put these posters up in your window?"
20614,homer,"hear ye, hear ye.  my daughter has something to say about"
20616,lisa,ahem.  jebediah springfield was nothing more than a murderous
20620,lisa,i hope you know you're sponsoring a celebration of a murderous
20627,lisa,"no, not janey!   she'll pack the supreme court with _boys_!"
20670,lisa,"you know dad, assisting mr. burns could give your career a real"
20671,marge," you know homer, assisting mr. burns"
20673,marge, soooorry! next time get your own darn corn.
20674,homer,"um, is this the chair i'll be sitting on?"

20687,homer," uh, mr. smithers? i don't"
20689,homer,um... what do i do in case of fire?
20694,homer,"uh, smithers already left, sir. i'm his replacement, homer"
20697,homer,but i think the dodo went extinct...
20699,homer," uh huh. uh huh. okay. um, can you repeat the part"
20703,homer,"i know, i'm taping it. i want to get to burns' house bright and"

20709,homer,"well, you can either get up or go back to sleep."
20717,homer," yello, mr. burns' office."
20719,homer,"it's mr. smithers, he's calling for you."
20724,bart,"look alive, simpson, i'm not paying you to goldbrick."
20726,bart,"now get cracking on my long division, and don't forget to show"
20727,homer,"i'll have it on your desk tomorrow morning, sir."
20728,lisa,"bart, leave simpson alone!  simpson, i need"
20730,marge,"kids, stop exploiting your father. homie, why don't you lie down"
20731,homer,"no time, marge. i thing mr. burns wants me to do some long"
20741,marge,"is there something wrong, homie?"
20744,homer,except... i killed mr. burns!
20746,homer,i punched burns right in his 104-year-old face.
20747,lisa,are you sure he's dead? maybe you just really really hurt him.
20748,marge,"okay, maybe everything's all right, maybe if you go apologize he"
20749,homer,"i'm really sorry i hit you mr. burns. here, let me put some salt"
20757,homer," hi, mr. burns! you want your coffee now?"
20760,homer,"uh, well, can i at least drive you home, mr. burns? it's 5"
20762,homer,"would you like me to shred those environmental reports for you,"
20765,homer,"uh, mr. burns, is there anything at all i can do for you?"
20771,homer, *you* shouldn't have gone away in vacation.
20774,homer,i just feel terrible about getting mr. smithers fired. that job
20775,bart,"quick mom, whip up a cake before dad fires ya!"
20791,homer, hello mr. burns? this is your mother.
20795,homer," son, this is mrs. burns. i just called to"
20799,homer,"ya really blew it this time, smithers."
20805,bart,what did you get that for?
20806,homer,for knocking mr. burns out of a 3rd story window.
20812,bart,"lisa, if i ever stop loving violence, i want you to shoot me."
20816,homer,"bye kids! on your way back, pick up a six-pack of beer."
20819,lisa,we gotta get seats for the itchy & scratchy parade.
20820,marge,"i won't have my children sitting alone on a cold, dangerous"
20821,homer,ohh... why can't they just take the gun?
20822,lisa,"hey, the comic book store is still open."
20827,bart,how come i've never seen that itchy & scratchy before?
20829,bart,cool! i'll give you ten bucks for that.
20834,homer,which one's itchy? the car?
20836,homer,oh. i guess it's not him then.
20845,bart,you invented itchy? the _itchy & scratchy_ itchy?
20847,bart,"well, i'm not calling you a liar but... but i can't think of a"
20851,bart,"i can't believe it. that was itchy all right, you _did_ invent"
20854,bart,"you can't just go back to the gutter. you created itchy, you"
20856,bart,you asked roger myers _sr._ for money. roget myers jr. is in
20857,bart,there's a box you can sleep in.
20859,bart,just move that cot out of the way.
20861,bart,do you know what radon is?
20864,homer,"oh, it's just bart and a mysterious stranger."
20865,bart,"he's not a regular bum, mom; he's a genius bum. he created itchy"
20869,bart,"a thousand dollars? but your ad says ""no money down""."
20873,bart,so you _don't_ work on a contingency basis?
20875,bart,"hey dad, can i have a thousand dollars?"
20876,homer,all right...  wait a minute! for what?
20877,bart,"to pay for a lawyer, for my bum."
20883,marge,that does it! one of them has to go.
20914,bart,"keep the trial going, i'll be right back."
20920,marge,uh... hmm... how about... ghostmutt?
20922,bart,we killed itchy & scratchy?
20926,lisa,it's one of those campy '70s throwbacks that appeals to
20927,bart,we need another vietnam to thin out their ranks a little.
20929,bart,ow! we gotta get itchy & scratchy back.
20933,bart,you've got to make more itchy & scratchy cartoons.
20934,lisa,the judge says it's okay as long as you pay mr. lampwick
20937,bart,"dad, can we have $183,000?"
20939,bart,lisa and i want to finance a series of animated cartoons.
20942,lisa," i give up, there's nothing we can do."
20943,bart,"yeah, i agree. you wanna start on trying to get apu out of jail?"
20946,bart,"what a perfect plan. now, roger myers will tell as just..."
20948,bart,what the hell is going on?
20949,lisa,"i don't know, but it looks like you might have a little"
20954,bart,i never even heard about that.
20955,bart,"i guess you don't need it now, but, we had a plan too."
20968,homer,"well, it's not quite a mop, and it's not quite a puppet, but"
20969,bart,why'd they make that one muppet out of leather?
20970,marge,"that's not a leather muppet, that's troy mcclure. mmm, back in"
20971,homer,"yeah, who'd have thought he'd turn out to be such a weirdo?"
20972,marge,what are you talking about?
20973,homer,"you know, his bizarre personal life. those weird things they say"
20974,marge,"oh, homer, that's just an urban legend. people don't do that"
21008,homer,"pft... troy mcclure. he's a washed-up movie star, he could be"
21050,bart, this play has everything!
21051,homer,"oh, i love legitimate theater."
21056,lisa,hi. i remember you from such filmstrips as locker room towel
21061,homer,"i know, i know; it's selma, right?"
21063,homer,"ah, hell... well, what about dracula?"
21065,homer,"troy buddy, i gotta know. what's a great guy like you wanna"
21073,homer,"hey, look what i snagged, marge"
21074,marge,it was a beautiful wedding. i've never seen selma happier.
21075,homer,"that reminds me, troy said something interesting last night at"
21077,homer,"marge, could you close your eyes? i'm trying to sleep."
21135,bart, go to work with your parents day?
21137,lisa,i still don't understand why you get to stay home and watch mom
21138,bart,"because i've always been an advocate of women in the workplace,"
21139,marge,"lisa, you'll have a fine time at the plant with dad.  you've"
21140,lisa,i signed numerous petitions to shut down that plant.
21142,bart,"mom, you're blocking the tv.  if you need something to do, you"
21143,marge," parent's occupation ... please note, homemaker is not"
21148,lisa,"no, thanks.  do you have any fruit?"
21150,homer,oh!  this is a map of nuclear sites around the country.  as a
21151,lisa,why are there so many burnt-out ones?
21152,homer,'cause they won't hire me an assistant.
21153,lisa,maybe we can make your job more fun.
21157,bart,"yes, you're right milhouse.   it is a fake,"
21160,bart,maybe when we find something decent to do with this id.
21166,bart," gentlemen, for our road trip i have"
21170,marge,"the national grammar rodeo?  i wish i were going.  oh, wait,"
21172,lisa,"it's not fair.  i'm the best student in school, how come i"
21173,bart,"maybe because you are, as we say in latin, a ""dorkus malorkus."""
21174,lisa,"that's not latin.   mom, bart's faking it."
21175,marge,"lisa, you've had your glory.  now it's bart's turn."
21178,marge," hello?  oh, homey, hello!  i can't remember"
21179,homer,"hi lisa, how's your spring break going?"
21180,lisa,i'm learning about owls.
21181,homer,"oh, owls, eh?  so you probably wouldn't want to spend another"
21182,lisa,sure i would.  i can always learn about owls this summer at
21185,bart,we're not going to a grammar rodeo.  that was just an
21194,homer,you made it!  you have any trouble getting past the security
21197,lisa," zagnut bar, mr. smithers?"
21198,homer,they all have hilarious names and are delicious.
21209,marge,"with bart gone and now you with your father, i'm not going to"
21213,bart,"branson, missouri.  my dad says it's like vegas -- if it were"
21215,bart,"aw, we don't need to stop here."
21219,lisa,"okay, time for truth or dare.  you go first."
21220,homer,"ehh, truth.  ask me anything."
21222,homer,"d'oh!  all right, dare."
21223,homer,"hello, i'd like to speak with a mr. snotball, first name ura."
21225,homer,"what?  how dare you?  if i find out who this is, i'll staple a"
21228,homer,"uh, do you have a crush on anyone?"
21230,homer,"i , oh, i won't tell anybody."
21231,lisa,"dad, you tell everybody everything.  even moe knew when i"
21232,lisa,okay.  i like... langdon alger.
21233,homer,i have no idea who that is.
21245,lisa,hmmm -- you could travel for free if you were a stewardess.
21247,lisa,"there's something troubling me, dad, but i don't think i can"
21248,homer,"ah, you don't have to tell me, but i thought we trusted each"
21249,lisa,"langdon alger?  oh, i don't like him anymore."
21250,lisa,"okay, but you gotta promise you won't get mad or tell anyone,"
21252,lisa, bart rented a car with a phony driver's
21254,homer,"all right, i have thought this through.  i will send bart the"
21255,lisa,"no, no!  then he'll know i told."
21256,marge," hello?  oh hello, principal skinner.  no, bart"
21258,bart,"milhouse, do you ever think about the people in those cars?"
21266,lisa,"mom, someone threw gum in my hair."
21267,marge,are you sure?  maybe it's just shampoo.  that washes right out.
21346,lisa,"no, i've got gum in my hair."
21347,marge,"oh, we've tried everything"
21348,lisa,my scalp hurts from horsefly bites.
21362,bart,"grampa! i don't mind when you spit at home, but i have to work"
21378,bart,"and then, he claimed he was the one who turned cats and dogs"
21379,homer,maybe it's time we put grampa in a home.
21380,lisa,you already put him in a home.
21381,bart,maybe it's time we put him in one where he can't get out.
21382,lisa,old people deserve our respect. look at jacques cousteau and
21383,homer,"pftt... second class? what about social security, bus discounts,"
21408,marge,it's grampa. and it sounds like he's gotten into the horseradish
21410,lisa,"uh, grampa, maybe i should moisten your washcloth."
21412,marge,where are we going to put him?
21418,bart,"look, if you're gonna stay in my room, could you at least stop"
21421,bart,"mm-hmm. you bossed around the richest, most powerful guy in town."
21436,bart,"great story grampa, could've used a vampire though. 'night."
21439,bart,"oh, wow! there really is a treasure! whatever you do, don't"
21442,bart,"hey, mr. burns! can i go with you to get the treasure? i won't"
21448,bart,"not without the keys, he isn't! "
21450,bart,now we can get the treasure!
21452,bart,"i can't believe you, grampa. the sergeant in that story you told"
21455,homer,where are you two going at this hour?
21461,bart,"hey, grampa, do you think that dead bodies get up and walk around"
21476,bart,"64 times, no more, no less. got it."
21478,bart,"hey, grampa, do you thing i could've been a flying hellfish?"
21481,bart,you coward! you're an embarrassment to the name hellfish.
21486,bart,"i'm sorry i cost you your fortune, grampa."
21497,bart,"you never were, grampa."
21499,bart,i won't get embarrassed; i don't care who knows i love my
21502,homer,"let's all calm down.  everyone's going to be just fine, as long"
21504,marge,"well, things were bad everywhere."
21505,homer,i'm sick of these constant bear attacks.  it's like a frickin'
21506,homer,"we're here, we're queer, we don't want anymore bears."
21509,homer,"oh, i heard it at the mustache parade they have every year."
21514,homer,"mr. mayor, i hate to break it to you, but this town is infested"
21518,homer,not a bear in sight.  the bear patrol must be working like a
21519,lisa,"that's spacious reasoning, dad."
21521,lisa,by your logic i could claim that this rock keeps tigers away.
21525,lisa,it's just a stupid rock.
21527,lisa,"but i don't see any tigers around, do you?"
21528,homer,"lisa, i want to buy your rock."
21529,homer,woo-hoo!  a perfect day.  zero bears and one big fat hairy
21530,lisa,"actually, dad, it's the smallest tax increase in history."
21531,homer,let the bears pay the bear tax.  i pay the homer tax.
21532,lisa,that's home-_owner_ tax.
21533,homer,"well, anyway, i'm still outraged."
21541,lisa,"i don't see how you can support proposition 24, dad."
21542,homer,"open your eyes, lisa!  our schools are so jam-packed with"
21543,bart,"there's no denying it, sis."
21555,homer,"hey, those are exactly my sentimonies."
21561,marge,you know what?  i'm going to vote no on 24.
21562,lisa,"mom, you're the greatest! ... can i have this licorice? "
21563,homer,"darn it, apu, i'm not gonna let them kick you out!"
21566,lisa,all right!  now you have all the simpsons behind you.
21568,homer,and i'm not registered.
21569,homer," hello, selma?  selma my dear, how are you? ..."
21574,bart,"hear that?  hear that, mom?  she's as dumb as me."
21575,lisa,"no, not what he said.  what he is.  grandfather, as in"
21577,lisa,there's an amnesty that was declared for people who've lived here
21578,marge,but the vote on proposition 24 is on tuesday.  you'll have to
21580,homer,"oh, it can't be that many.  come on, apu.  i'll be your tutor."
21588,lisa,"you know, in a way, all americans are immigrants.  except, of"
21589,homer,"yeah, native americans like us."
21590,lisa,"no, i mean american indians."
21593,homer,"well, we'll have to organize a car pool. hey! every day will be"
21595,homer,"so... how about those rainbow suspenders, huh?"
21597,homer,"pretty cool way to keep your pants up, eh?"
21599,homer,"i see these kids now with ""jive"" printed on their shirts."
21600,lisa,"dad... please just drive the car, dad."
21601,homer,"i'm watching the road, sweetie."
21602,bart,"dad, please, you're embarrassing us."
21604,bart,dad! no one cares about any of your stupid dinosaur bands! you
21605,homer,i'm just trying to party with you guys.
21606,bart,"homer, first of all, it's ""par-tay"", and second, we wouldn't"
21607,homer,"now, here are some of your no-name bands. sonic youth? nine inch"
21609,homer,there can only be one truly great festival a lifetime and it's
21611,homer,"the ""us festival""! geez! it was sponsored by the guy from apple"
21616,homer, i went to the record store today and they were playing
21617,marge,"hmm. record stores have always seemed crazy to me, but it"
21618,bart,"dear lord, if you keep homer from embarrassing us today, we"
21620,lisa,"dad, you forgot to pick up milhouse."
21621,homer, i did? i must be getting forgetful in my old age.
21622,homer,well? what have we here? looks like your uncool dad scored
21623,lisa, bart... these look real...
21624,bart,check the authenticator spot
21627,lisa,generation x may be shallow but at least they have tolerance and
21631,lisa,it smells like otto's jacket...
21636,bart,"dad, you cannot wear that! that's a rastafarian hat."
21637,homer,"pft. hey, i've been safariing since before you were born."
21638,lisa,wearing a jamaican hat makes a bold statement about your
21640,bart,"you know what, dad? maybe we'll go exploring on our own for a"
21641,homer,"good concert, am i right?"
21646,homer,what did i say? what's going on?
21649,lisa,"it may be bleak, but this music is really getting to the crowd."
21650,bart,"eh, making teenagers depressed is like shooting fish in a barrel."
21654,marge,so... you want to go on tour with a traveling freak show.
21655,homer,"i don't think i have a choice, marge."
21656,marge,of course you have a choice.
21658,marge,you don't have to join a freak show just because the opportunity
21659,homer,"you know, marge, in some ways, you and i are very different"
21662,homer,"homer simpson, smiling politely."
21663,homer,"you know, my kids think you're the greatest. and thanks to your"
21671,homer,we got a little rule back home
21675,homer,really? me too! but i got kicked out 'cause of my views of
21676,homer,"pftt... rules. i'm a rocker, i don't care for rules."
21678,homer,"die? well, you don't scare me, doc, 'cause dying would be a"
21681,bart,"so, what's it like being famous, dad?"
21682,homer,"people know your name, but you don't know theirs. it's great."
21683,bart,do you wear boxers or briefs?
21686,homer,"you know, the one with all the well-meaning rules that don't"
21689,marge,this is so exciting. last time i got to go backstage was when
21706,marge,cannons are designed to hurt. they're designed to hurt.
21707,lisa,"shh! mom, dad needs our support."
21709,bart,you're the coolest dad alive!
21710,homer,"oh, marge. i thought i had an appetite for destruction, but"
21711,marge,there might be one in this cooler.
21718,homer,"i'll miss you, pumpkins, but i just can't share your bleak"
21723,homer,"so, i realized that being with my family is more important"
21724,bart,"dad, what you just said was powerfully uncool."
21725,homer,you know what the song says
21727,homer,so lame that it's... cool?
21731,marge,"good. i'm glad. and that's what makes me cool, not caring,"
21733,marge,"well, how the hell do you be cool? i feel like we've tried"
21734,homer,"wait, marge. maybe if you're truly cool, you don't need to"
21736,lisa,how else would you know?
21747,lisa,"in the beginning of the school year, each of you received a"
21750,lisa,"mr. estes, the publications advisor.  i edited the whole thing."
21753,bart,"hi, becky, thanks for coming out. "
21755,bart,your daughter is named seymour?
21757,marge,"and you're sure the flanderses won't be there?  well, it sounds"
21758,marge,"bart, you can invite milhouse.  lisa, you can bring a friend"
21759,lisa," hey.  great... a friend... heh, heh..."
21760,marge,"so, did you call any of your friends?0"
21761,lisa,friend?   these are my only friends.
21762,marge,"girls, lisa.  boys kiss girls."
21763,marge,i'm sure you'll make plenty of friends.  all you have to do is
21764,lisa,be myself?  i've been myself for eight years and it hasn't
21765,homer, somebody's travelling light.
21766,lisa,meh.  maybe you're just getting stronger.
21767,homer,"well, i have been eating more."
21769,bart,when the hell are we getting to... where the hell are we going?
21770,marge,mmm.  it's called little pwagmattasquarmesettport.  it's known
21771,bart,i thought springfield was america's scrod basket.
21772,marge,"no, springfield is america's crud bucket.  at least according"
21777,lisa, it must be exciting to make a different set of beds.
21778,marge,"i know you're joking, but it is!  say, why don't you put on"
21779,lisa,"you know, it's kinda funny.  with all the craziness and"
21780,marge,"lisa, that's not at all like you."
21784,lisa,"a library! ... no, i can't... that's the old, nerdy lisa."
21790,lisa, only kids are that incoherent!
21793,lisa,i usually hang out in front.
21795,lisa,"well, it beats doing stuff."
21797,marge,"come on, homer.  open the door for your mystery date."
21798,homer," ooh, the captain of the football team.  he's a"
21800,lisa,a gift from my favorite crustacean.
21802,lisa,nooo... i heard it on baywatch.
21803,marge,didn't you buy any meat?
21804,homer, this baby's sure to kill something.
21805,marge,let lisa be alone with her new friends.
21806,bart,they're _my_ friends rightfully.  she only got them by copying
21807,lisa," don't have a cow, man!"
21808,bart,see?  that's my expression.
21809,marge,"oh, you haven't said that in four years.  let lisa have it."
21810,bart,it's the principle.  she's got to learn!
21811,marge,"no!  now, park your keister, meister."
21815,lisa,this is the most thoughtful thing anyone has ever--
21816,homer,sweet merciful crap!  my _car_!
21820,lisa,"did you hear that, bart?"
21821,bart,maybe it was just the cat.
21822,lisa,"no, she's sleeping with me."
21823,bart,did you guys hear something moving around in the attic last
21824,homer,"attic? oh, that's silly.    seriously though, don't ever"
21825,marge,"homer, isn't it about time for the... you know?"
21826,homer,"yeah, yeah, i'll go feed it."
21830,bart,tell us what's the secret.
21831,homer,no more questions. i work my butt off to feed you four kids and
21832,marge,"three. we have three kids, homer."
21833,homer,"yeah, three nosy kids. and you know what happens to nosy kids"
21835,lisa,"  bart, do you think it's safe?"
21836,bart,  i don't care -- i can't breathe in here!
21838,marge,you went into the attic?    i'm very disappointed and
21839,marge,"yes, doctor. it's what we've always feared"
21841,marge,"hmm. i'm afraid we haven't been entirely honest with you, bart."
21842,lisa,so i have two brothers?
21846,lisa,"i believe they prefer to be called ""conjoined twins""."
21848,marge,i think i'll bottle-feed that one.
21851,homer,we chained hugo up in the attic like an animal and fed him a
21852,marge,it's saved our marriage.
21854,homer,we'll search out every place a sick twisted solitary misfit might
21855,lisa,i'll start with radio shack.
21858,bart,but you'll kill both of us.
21864,bart,"oh, don't look so shocked."
21867,lisa,"mom, hugo's eating his napkin."
21868,bart,"  hey, can i have some turkey?"
21869,marge,"no, you finish your fish heads. then we'll talk.  [closes the"
21872,lisa,this tooth will be perfect for my science project.
21874,bart,"hey, lis. check out my science project.  [rubs a balloon over"
21875,lisa,ow! what's that's supposed to prove?
21876,bart,that nerds conduct electricity.  
21879,lisa,  tiny little people! my god! i've created life!
21880,marge,lisa! breakfast! we're having waffles!
21882,bart,your micro-jerks attacked me!
21883,lisa,"well, you practically destroyed their whole world."
21884,bart,"you can't protect them every second. sooner or later, you'll let"
21887,lisa,your world is incredible. and you speak english.
21889,lisa,"listen, i can take care of everything. all you have to do is"
21891,lisa,"oh, great. i'm stuck in this lousy tub for the rest of my life."
21895,homer,"ah... the old fishin' hole. so peaceful and relaxing, doesn't"
21898,homer,"  i suppose you want to probe me. well, might as well get"
21900,homer,i guess you mean president clinton. he usually hangs around
21902,homer,"except, um... there's this election next week, so after that, it"
21904,homer,what are you spraying me with?
21909,marge,"hmm, that's slick willie for you, always with the smooth talk."
21921,homer,stop! those candidates are phonies!
21930,homer,"america, take a good look at your beloved candidates. they're"
21936,marge,i don't understand why we have to build a ray gun to aim at a
21937,homer,"don't blame me, i voted for kodos."
21939,marge,you took a new job in a strange town without discussing it with
21940,homer,of course not. i wouldn't do that!    why not?
21941,marge,"we have roots here, homer. we have friends and family and library"
21942,homer,"but, marge, this is a chance for me to fulfil my lifelong dream."
21944,homer,promise not to laugh? i always wanted to own the dallas cowboys.
21945,lisa,"i'm sorry, dad. i just find that very cute."
21946,marge,i've dug myself into a happy little rut here and i'm not about to
21947,homer,"just bring the rut with ya, honey."
21949,homer,"uh, let's watch something else."
21950,marge,"homer, you're trying to talk us into moving to this place."
21951,homer,"oh, yeah, that's right. let's watch this."
21954,homer,"well, what do you think of me and cypress creek now, marge?"
21955,marge,it does seem nicer than springfield.
21956,lisa,"yeah, did you notice how the people weren't shoving or knocking"
21961,marge,"even if we sell the house, we still don't come close to"
21968,homer,i'm gonna miss springfield. this town's been awfully good to us.
21969,bart,"no, it hasn't, dad. that's why we're leaving."
21970,homer,"oh, yeah.    so long, stinktown!"
21977,marge,"mr. scorpio, this house is almost too good for us. i keep"
21979,marge,"okay, the oven is cleaning itself, the autovac's on dirt patrol,"
21982,homer,"yes, sir. i will notice that. very casual, mr. scorpion."
21984,homer,"mm-hmm.    hmm, uh, let's see..."
21989,homer,"don't worry, that won't take long."
21995,homer,  are you guys working?
21997,homer,"could you, um... work any harder than this?"
22003,bart,"um, well, i know hell and damn and bit..."
22004,bart,"so, what are you in for?"
22009,bart,let me get this straight. we're behind the rest of our class
22012,bart,"listen lady, i'm s'pose to be in the fourth grade."
22016,lisa,"  hello, mr. chipmunk. you're a northern"
22017,homer,"  tom landry's hat, and it's autographed. ""to berman's dry"
22019,homer,i can't buy that. only management-type guys with big salaries
22022,homer,"sir, i need to know where i can get some business hammocks."
22028,homer,"oh, the hammock district."
22046,homer,uh... you have any sugar around here?
22061,lisa,"i'b allergic to everythig here. by nose is so stuffed ub, i"
22062,marge,"i've been so bored since we moved here, i found myself drinking a"
22063,homer,"well, the simpson men are doing fine, right bart? you haven't"
22064,bart,"i can't get in trouble at school, they put me in the remedial"
22067,homer,"oh, those jerks always walking over the small businessman. don't"
22069,homer,nothing big. it's just a lot of little things.
22073,homer,all right. what's the number?
22075,homer," ""project arcturus couldn't have succeeded without you."
22076,marge,i think owning the denver broncos is pretty good.
22078,marge,"well, explain to me why it isn't."
22079,homer,"  you just don't understand football, marge."
22084,marge,weren't there three indians last year?
22085,homer,"look, marge!  they opened a new high-tech gadget store!  you love"
22087,homer,like bull you don't.  come on.
22088,marge,"homer, please!  you're hurting my arm."
22090,bart,"hey, lis! check out this space-age toothbrush.  "
22091,lisa,that's an electric nostril groomer.
22093,marge,night vision goggles?  a bathroom scale from a soviet sub?  a
22094,homer,"  marge, look!  ""the world's best jacket.""  if i had"
22101,bart,i'll give you four bucks for it.
22105,bart,"well, not really, 'cause yours is just a piece of extension"
22108,bart,"i was hoping it wouldn't come to this, but... you guys asked for"
22110,homer,"looking good, son.    hey!  what happened to your"
22111,homer,"son, there's only one thing punks like that understand"
22112,bart,but then they'll just beat me up even worse!
22113,homer,"yes, they are a clever bunch.  i know.  i'll squeal for"
22117,homer,big deal.  i didn't even get my kid's belt back.  the only thing
22133,homer,you used to be a boxer just like me?
22137,homer,  you know lucius sweet?!  he's one of the biggest names
22142,marge,"before you even consider this, i insist you consult a doctor."
22147,marge,  that's what we get for living in a state founded by
22155,homer,then i can just push him over.
22166,homer,"brawled his way up from the boxcars, did he?"
22169,homer,"  gee, thanks, moe.  what's this?"
22193,marge,"homer, why are they saying you're going to fight drederick tatum?"
22194,homer,"  uh, well, uh, i was gonna surprise you, but... happy"
22195,homer,i'll make a fortune for one night's work!  we can have all the
22198,homer,"marge!  will you let me finish?  plug-in room deodorizers, front"
22199,lisa,"mom's right, dad.  the odds against you winning are a thousand to"
22200,homer,"whoa, i don't think it's that unlikely."
22201,lisa,those are the odds they're giving in vegas.
22202,homer,"all right, i think we've heard just about enough from mr."
22209,marge,"moe, i'm so glad i found you.  please, promise me you won't let"
22222,homer,"okay, homer, nothing to be worried about.  just... "
22223,bart,wow!  i've never seen dad hit somebody like that before!
22224,lisa,what are you talking about?
22225,bart,isn't dad the one in the black trunks?
22228,marge,  what?  what?  what am i
22229,marge,"  homer!  homer, he's not going to"
22233,marge,somebody stop the fight!  where's the doctor?!
22237,homer,but you stopped the fight.  won't everyone be mad at you?
22245,marge,"oh, homie!  are you okay?"
22246,homer, i can't remember where we parked.
22247,marge,that's all right.  we'll just wait till everyone else leaves.
22251,lisa,what a perfect outing for a beautiful autumn day.
22252,marge,i feel sorry for everyone who's cooped up inside watching the
22253,homer," yeah, they won't learn anything about apples today."
22257,homer,twenty of the suckiest minutes of my life.
22262,marge,"next to spring and winter, fall is my absolute favorite season."
22263,lisa,"it's not ""foilage,"" mom, it's ""foliage.""  foo-liage."
22264,marge,"that's what i said, foilage.  it doesn't take a nucular scientist"
22276,marge,i can honestly say that was the most fun i've ever had.  the
22277,homer,ooh!  let's pick him up!
22278,marge,no!  what if he's crazy?
22279,homer,and what if he's not?  then we'd look like idiots.
22280,marge,we're not picking him up.
22282,marge,there's not enough room.
22284,marge,i just don't think it's a good idea.
22285,homer,and i think it's the best idea i've ever had.  we're picking up the
22286,marge,careful of the apple pie on the seat.
22288,marge,"grampa, are you sitting on the pie?"
22291,bart,"yeah, sure, we know him.  that's mr. burns."
22292,lisa,he tried to kill our puppies.
22293,marge,he sexually harassed me.
22295,homer,he made fun of my weight.
22314,homer,"wow, that's really lazy."
22317,homer,"...and larry and i have so much in common, marge, way more than"
22318,marge, i think we've heard enough about larry burns for one
22319,homer,why?  it's not like anything interesting happened to anyone else
22337,homer,"oh, all the time!  have you ever heard of this kid milhouse?"
22343,homer,it's so unfair.  you're everything a dad could hope for.
22345,homer,"larry, there's only one sure way to make him realize how much he"
22354,marge,what are you doing in the basement?  it's like you're hiding out
22355,homer,"hiding out??  pfft.  marge, you've been reading too many hideout"
22356,marge,and what's that hitchhiker doing here?  is every drifter we meet
22357,homer,of course not.  we'll decide that on a drifter-by-drifter basis.
22358,bart,he's great at pointing out everyone's foibles.
22360,bart,"he's kiddin', mom.  but seriously, i'd love to have hair like"
22361,lisa,"hey, that reminds me, mom; buckingham palace called.  they want"
22365,homer,"  hello, mr. burns.  this is the"
22367,homer,"if you really love larry, prove it, and you can have him back"
22369,homer,don't you care about your son?  this is more important than
22371,homer,uh...    just a second.
22375,lisa,"hey, i think i got a pai gow."
22376,bart,  i hate pai gow.  can't we just play quang jong?
22377,marge,"i want you to take larry back to mr. burns right now, before you"
22378,homer,but the.. wh.. marge!  it's broad daylight and there's cops
22379,marge,no excuses.  just do it.
22385,homer,  the abandoned warehouse!
22386,homer,d'oh!  stupid economic recovery!
22388,homer,  they'll never look for us here.
22391,homer,"you don't like it, call the cops.  "
22392,marge,"oh, give yourself up, homie!"
22393,bart,"no, dad!  shoot your way out!"
22397,lisa,we've gotta go down there and help dad!
22398,homer,"ouch!  oooch!  eeech!  ouch!  oooch!   oh, stop it!"
22403,homer,"maybe we did fake a kidnapping, but is that really such a crime?"
22410,lisa,who's playing that music?
22411,marge,and where's all that liquor coming from?
22412,homer,"it's a party, marge.  doesn't have to make sense."
22413,homer,"woo-hoo-hoo-hoo!  oh, yeah!"
22417,homer,"sorry, sorry, my fault."
22419,homer, someone found my keys!
22422,homer,"it'll be okay, honey.  there's lots more oil where that came"
22426,lisa,"we'd be doing our part for the environment!  plus, we'd get to"
22427,marge,"honey, we don't need to drive 400 miles to clean animals.  you"
22428,lisa,"oh, mom, please?  you can make this my birthday and christmas"
22429,marge,you already used up your birthday and christmas presents on that
22430,lisa,"yes, i do.  sure, i do.  look!"
22431,marge," oh, all right, we'll go."
22432,marge,now the cat needs his medication...
22434,marge,... every morning and the furnace has been putting off...
22435,homer,can do.  right.  uh-huh.
22436,marge,"... a lot of carbon monoxide, so keep the window open."
22437,homer,gotcha.  cat in the furnace.
22438,marge,"ah, you know, i think we'll take maggie with us."
22439,homer,a whole week of just father and son.  see you at dinner.
22441,homer,you know?  i don't know.
22443,homer,"all right, just wake me up."
22444,homer," you know, bart, i saw this one."
22447,bart,"dad, do i have to brush my teeth?"
22448,homer,"no, but at least rinse your mouth out with soda."
22449,lisa," i'm gonna rescue a baby seal, and then i'm gonna"
22452,lisa,you mean there's nothing left to clean?
22454,marge,i've got rocks that need washing at home
22455,homer,"geez, look at this place.  we gotta do something."
22457,bart,dad?  i think i need some fresh air.  can i go to the park?
22461,bart,"milhouse, this is boring.  make it crash or something."
22473,homer,just a minute!    hello?
22475,homer,i have misplaced my pants.
22476,homer,"aw, i don't know how to punish you.  what does marge usually do?"
22477,bart,she makes me taste beer.
22478,homer,"come on, boy, give your old man a little credit."
22479,homer,now you're gonna do chores for that lady until you work off the
22480,bart,i can't believe i've gotta spend all my free time dusting doilies
22482,bart,"wow, man, what is this place?"
22485,bart,he's tough but fair.  i'll start sorting these bras.
22487,bart,just glad to be on the team.
22489,bart,"ah, the ol' greet'n'toss.  no problemo."
22496,lisa,"oh, there's something unsatisfying about scrubbing these rocks"
22497,marge,"lisa, i know it's frustrating, but we made a commitment, and we"
22501,bart,so who's gonna warm up the crowd tonight?
22505,bart,"heh, nudist colonies are everywhere these days.  i'd love to go,"
22507,homer,"i told you last night, no!"
22509,homer,"i don't care if he was filling in for mel zetz, he's my son, and"
22511,homer," yes, everyone loves rules."
22513,homer,"oh yeah, drugs, you gotta have drugs."
22514,bart,"hey, he didn't pay the cover."
22523,bart,"hello, principal skinner."
22525,homer,"uh, this isn't going to be about jesus, is it?"
22531,homer,"oh, no?  well, if homer simpson wants his ten-year-old son working in"
22533,marge,"homer, did you know it was a burlesque house when you sent bart"
22534,homer,"no, i only learned that four days ago."
22535,marge,"what were you thinking, sending bart to such an awful place?"
22536,homer,i was trying to punish him exactly like you would.   so in a
22538,marge,springfield doesn't want places like this.
22540,marge,oh?  i've lived in this town for thirty-seven years.
22546,marge,i'm here to share my moral outrage.  but this time it's not
22548,marge,no.  it's a house of ill fame.  a house of loose ethics.
22550,marge, the house is perfectly fine!
22580,homer,sure. we could tear this house down...
22581,homer,no!  my friends!  stop!  let me finish.
22584,homer,"what are you doing, marge?  didn't you hear the song?"
22585,marge,"no, i had to go rent the bulldozer."
22588,marge,what about the sleaze and the depravity?
22591,marge,oh.  can you sing it again?
22593,marge,"well, i also have a song to sing."
22597,marge,"so, twiggy, i hear you and your husband, woody, just had a"
22600,bart,"  all right, dad, you've been warned, let's go."
22602,bart,"if you really wanted us to be neater, you'd serve us out of one"
22603,marge,you're talking about a trough.  we're not going to eat from a
22605,bart,"hey, this ain't the ritz."
22606,marge,i'm going into the dining room to have a conversation.  anyone
22607,marge,"  hello, marge.  how's the family?"
22608,homer,"keep it down in there, everybody!"
22609,marge,"homer, is this the way you pictured married life?"
22610,homer,"yeah, pretty much.  except we drove around in a van solving"
22611,marge,"homer, i want to throw a dinner party."
22612,homer," oh, i hate having parties.  the toilet always gets"
22613,marge,i don't care if the sink shoots sludge.  we're having a party.
22614,marge,ooh!  a punchbowl like that just screams good taste.  wouldn't it
22615,homer,"oh, we can't afford that.  who do you think i am, liz taylor?"
22616,marge,"well, maybe we could use it once, and then return it."
22617,homer,"marge, we're not talking about a toothbrush here."
22618,marge,"bart, company's coming, go put doilies under the coasters, hurry,"
22619,marge,"lisa, quick, screw these back on!"
22620,lisa,"mom, calm down, the party's not for another three hours!"
22621,marge,"oh, good!  that will give me time to add another coat of glaze to"
22625,homer,just gotta put my shoes on!
22626,marge,the only thing i asked you to do for this party was put on
22627,bart,"mom, reverend lovejoy doesn't have a coat.  should i let him"
22630,marge,did anyone see that new woodsy allen movie?
22634,homer,"you know what you two need?  a little comic strip called ""love"
22649,homer,shut up and let the woman talk.
22658,marge,"lisa, why don't you come sing for us?"
22659,lisa, you're a grand old flag...
22664,bart," hello, i'm doctor hibbert.  i'm afraid i'm going"
22670,homer,"well, i think that went pretty well."
22673,marge,i feel terrible.  the van houtens split up at our party.
22674,homer,"marge, please, that was twenty minutes ago."
22675,marge,i shouldn't have served those north korean fortune cookies. they
22677,homer,"you can't keep blaming yourself.  just blame yourself once, and"
22681,marge,"actually, luanne, i don't really know anything about you..."
22686,homer,i sleep in a big bed with my wife.
22692,homer," well, thanks for introducing me."
22702,homer,ow!  ow!  gee...  ow!  what the hell is wrong with you?!
22703,bart,"geez, sor-ry.  it's a pretty standard stunt, homer."
22704,marge,you said you'd do it as a favor to me.
22705,homer,that doesn't sound like something i'd say.
22706,marge,fine.  i'll go without you.
22709,homer," ""can i borrow a feeling?"""
22712,homer,"oh, that's tough, pal.  but it's never gonna happen to me."
22714,homer,'cause marge and i have one thing that can never be broken
22715,homer," marge, i'm home!  where are you?  are you okay?  i"
22718,homer,"i know you're only eight years old, and i don't want to put a lot"
22719,lisa,oh.  okay.  can i stay up?
22721,lisa,you've done a lot of crazy stuff over the years and she stood by
22722,homer, cause there's lots of stuff she doesn't know about!
22723,lisa,"you mean, like your poker shack out in the swamp?"
22726,homer,see?  you don't need to spend a lot of money to have a first-
22727,marge,  it's getting less and less likely you're going to yell
22728,homer,"""levi's.""  hey, you think that truck is full of jeans?"
22729,lisa,you're very lucky to have mom.  
22730,homer,  that's your advice?  go to bed!
22731,homer,"you know, marge, i was thinking about how much i enjoy your"
22732,marge,"homey, i appreciate this, but i'd really like to get some sleep."
22733,homer,"oh, of course, my sweet.  i'll just make some soothing ocean"
22734,homer,i'd like to file for... divorce.
22736,homer,"marge, will you marry me?"
22738,homer,"it's a second wedding, honey.  our first one was so crummy, i had"
22739,marge,"oh, homey.  i know you love me.  we don't need to get married"
22740,homer,"yes, we do, i got us a divorce this afternoon."
22742,homer,i didn't want a hokey second wedding like those ones on tv.
22744,homer,wait!  i want one last chance to enjoy single life.  [scratches
22763,lisa,"who does nelson think he's impressing, anyway, acting so"
22769,lisa,why do you have to be such a pain all the time?  don't you
22771,marge,an automatic dialer?  is that legal?  i don't want you getting
22773,marge,or swindling our neighbors.
22775,homer,now we just sit by the mailbox and watch the money roll in.
22776,marge,but you're going to annoy thousands of people just to make a few
22796,lisa,"milhouse, i've never told anyone this kind of thing before,"
22801,lisa,"but i bet underneath he's a sweet, sensitive person... like"
22802,lisa,i guess you could say i'm wanna bring out the milhouse in
22804,lisa,"i like you too, milhouse, but not in that way.  you're like a"
22806,lisa,"would you do me a favor?  when you get back to class, just"
22811,lisa,"milhouse, i'm so sorry!"
22813,lisa,nelson!  um... that note milhouse gave you?  it wasn't from him.
22815,lisa,"i don't know why i like you, i just do.  so... what do you"
22817,lisa,"well, would you like to come over to my house after school?"
22819,homer,woo-hoo!  two dollars!  it's working!
22822,bart,"hey, lis, mom said you had the toenail clippers and...  woah!"
22823,lisa,it's okay.  i invited him over.  nelson's my new... friend.
22824,bart,"are you nuts?  i'll probably never say this to you again, but..."
22825,lisa,"please don't ruin this for me, bart.  i think he's starting to"
22827,lisa,oh please!  milhouse like vaseline on toast!
22829,lisa," ""nuke the whales?""  you don't really believe that, do"
22832,marge,"when i first met your father, he was loud, crude and piggish."
22834,marge,"he's a whole new person, lisa."
22836,lisa,"isn't it nice up here?  what are you thinking, nelson?"
22840,lisa,  how do you feel?  what's inside you right now?
22842,lisa,"come on, nelson!  you must think and feel things.  i mean, look"
22844,lisa, my first kiss!  i always wondered what it would be
22849,lisa,"listen, you thugs. stop making fun of him or you'll be sorry."
22851,lisa,you'll be so sorry when you realize how you've hurt the
22867,homer,  will you two shut up?!  people are trying
22876,homer,lisa's window is the next one.
22885,homer," hey, who shot the auto-dialer?  [sees"
22893,lisa,i think they're giving up.
22898,lisa,don't worry.  nelson and i don't like each other anymore.
22900,lisa,"well, i'm really not thinking about that now."
22903,lisa,"hmm.  pressure dropping, humidity rising over eighty percent,"
22905,homer,oh lisa!  there's no record of a hurricane ever hitting
22906,lisa,"yes, but the records only go back to 1978 when the hall of"
22908,marge, that's true... but he shouldn't say it.
22912,lisa,"mom, let's just grab what we can and get out of here!  this"
22914,lisa,but i'm not fruit!  i'm a kid!
22922,homer,"oh, i'm sure i'd be a third wheel."
22924,homer, i would make it my business to be a third wheel.
22926,marge,why don't we do something to take our minds off the storm?
22927,lisa,"okay, start with diagonal colors."
22928,homer,use your main finger on the yellow side and your other finger on
22931,lisa," now you have to turn it back, mom..."
22932,homer, you gotta start backwards!
22934,lisa," no, not so fast!  no, ignore the red!"
22938,bart,spin the middle side topwise.  topwise!
22939,marge,now i remember why i put this down here in the first place!
22940,marge,"dear god, this is marge simpson.  if you stop this hurricane and"
22941,lisa,"wait!  listen, everybody."
22943,homer,"he fell for it!  way to go, marge!"
22951,homer,"now, that kind of attitude's not gonna get your house back."
22952,marge,i'm sure your insurance will cover the house.
22955,homer,"welp, call us if you need anything!"
22967,marge,"ned, maude!  you've got to go back to your house.  something"
22969,homer," hope you like it, neighbor.  we didn't"
22974,homer,"yeah, one out of twenty five ain't bad!  "
22979,bart,"ah, i wouldn't take it down if i were you.  it's a load-bearing"
22988,marge,"ned!  we meant well, and everyone here tried their best."
22993,bart,i am shocked and appalled.
22994,lisa,"mr. flanders, with all due respect, bart didn't do anything."
23002,homer,"hey, i got off pretty easy."
23023,homer,yello?  ...  yes?  ...  mental hospital?  ...  well i don't know
23024,marge,the man who lived next door until his house blew down?
23028,homer,"ned flanders, i mock your value system.  you also appear foolish"
23031,homer,past instances in which i professed to like you were fraudulent.
23034,homer,i engaged in intercourse with your spouse or significant other.
23035,homer,"  aw that's it, you just can't insult"
23037,homer,"you know what your problem is, flanders?  you're afraid to be"
23039,homer,"because humans are obnoxious, sometimes.  humans hate things."
23043,homer,"come on, flanders, there's gotta be something you hate.  what"
23045,homer,"what about, uhhhhh, florescent lights?"
23055,homer,"heh heh!  ned, you so craz-ay!"
23058,homer,"hey, who cut something out of my paper?"
23060,bart,not me.  i'm more of a mail-tamperer.
23061,marge,don't look at me.  just because i'm holding a pair of scissors.
23063,homer,what's wrong with you?  what are you trying to hide from me...
23064,marge,"all right, i was trying to keep it from you, but i had a good"
23065,homer,"well of course, everything looks bad if you remember it.  now"
23066,marge,"okay, we'll go to the chili cook-off, but i want you to promise"
23067,homer,"  okay, quit nagging me, i won't"
23069,lisa,i'm gonna go get some vegetarian chili before they get desperate
23070,bart,i'm gonna go claim some valuables at the lost-and-found.
23071,marge,"oh, look at that adorable spice rack!  eight spices?  some must"
23072,homer,"marge, we're missing the chili.  less artsy, more fartsy."
23073,marge,"homer, i happen to like handicrafts much more than stuffing my"
23074,homer,"fine, i'll come find you when i'm ready to stop having fun."
23078,marge,"thank you for your concern, helen.  homer isn't drinking today."
23083,homer,"  one, two... hey, what's the big idea?"
23088,marge,  it looks so complicated.  do you know how?
23091,homer,"uh, wiggy?  my chili's getting cold."
23093,homer," maybe i do, son.  maybe i do."
23113,homer,"oh, you want me to climb that, huh?  no problemo."
23114,bart,"lis, check it out.  time for chili."
23116,bart,you're just mad 'cause there's no clock in your hat.
23118,bart,"pff.  ah, this baby's wasted on an idiot like you."
23120,marge, your father decided he'd rather come
23124,homer,"if it's about laying off the insanity peppers, i'm way ahead of"
23126,homer,"yeah, that's me all right.  [homer has a glazed look in his eyes"
23128,homer,"well, what should i do?  should i meditate?  should i get rid of"
23130,homer,"you know, i have been meaning to take a spiritual journey, and i"
23133,homer,huh?  golf course?  did i dream that whole thing?  maybe the
23135,homer,"hey, wait a minute!  there's no such thing as a talking dog!"
23138,bart,"...so then i says to mabel, i says..."
23140,bart,"i'll finish this later.  hi, dad."
23143,bart,"so anyway, i says to mabel, i says..."
23144,homer,oh-ho.  i guess you're cranky 'cause i didn't come home last
23145,marge,"i'm ""cranky"" because my husband got drunk and humiliated me in"
23146,homer,"oh, honey, i didn't get drunk, i just went to a strange fantasy"
23147,homer,we don't have anything in common.
23150,homer,i always just figured my wife was my soulmate.  but if it's not
23156,homer,a machine?!  earl's a machine?!
23157,bart,hey look!  is that dad?
23158,lisa,"either that, or batman's really let himself go."
23162,homer,but how did you find me?
23163,marge,"well, i was sure you'd be on foot, because you always say public"
23164,homer,"or that little guy on the ""don't walk"" sign."
23165,homer,"wow, marge, you really do understand me.  see, i thought we"
23167,homer,"right, and we don't like the same things.  it's like you're from"
23168,marge,...and you're from mars.
23169,homer," oh, sure, give me the one with all the monsters."
23170,homer,"oh, marge!   we're number one!  we're number one!  in"
23192,lisa,"all right!  it's time for abc's ""tgif"" lineup!"
23193,bart,"lis, when you get a little older, you'll learn that friday is just"
23196,homer,"hmm... bold, refreshing, and something i can't quite put my"
23199,homer,"no time for you, old man!"
23200,homer,please!  don't hurt me!
23202,homer,yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!!!
23204,marge,"homer, it's 2 am.  what happened?"
23205,homer,"it was an alien, marge!  it appeared in front of me and said"
23206,marge,  have you been drinking?
23208,homer,"i'm telling you, i saw a creature from another planet."
23209,lisa,maybe you just dreamed it.
23210,homer,"oh yeah?  well, when i came to, i was covered with a sticky,"
23212,lisa,"dad, according to ""junior skeptic magazine,"" the chances are 175"
23214,lisa,it's just that the people who claim they've seen aliens are
23215,homer," oh, it's bart.  i can't believe it.  i'm"
23217,homer,"yes!  remember, it's the same day as the dog's."
23218,lisa,"santa's little helper, it's your birthday?  ooh!  we've gotta get"
23220,marge,  good doggie.  good doggie.
23222,homer,"the alien has a sweet, heavenly voice... like urkel!  and he"
23224,homer,you don't have to humiliate me.
23237,homer,"well, the evening began at the gentleman's club, where we were"
23239,homer,we were sitting in barney's car eating packets of mustard.  you
23246,homer,"oh marge, i never felt so alone.  no one believes me.  "
23247,marge,"i don't believe you, homer."
23248,homer,"you do??  oh, marge, you've made me so happy!"
23249,marge,"hmm, you're not listening.  you're only hearing what you wanna"
23250,homer,thanks!  i'd love an omelette right about now.
23251,marge,"i try to be supportive, but this has gone too far!  please, just"
23252,homer,"no, i can't.  this is my cause.  i'm like the man who"
23253,bart,"hey, dad.  what's the word with planet crackpot?"
23254,homer,"oh, i suppose you're going to mock me, too!"
23255,bart,"well, actually, dad... i believe you."
23257,bart,"yes, i do.  you seem so damn sure."
23258,homer,"thank you, son.  and do you think you can stop the casual"
23261,homer,"this friday, we're going back to the woods and we're going to"
23263,homer,"we'll fake it, and sell it to the fox network."
23264,bart,  they'll buy anything.
23265,homer,"now, son, they do a lot of quality programming, too."
23266,bart,"hey, dad, can i have a sip of your beer?"
23267,homer,"now, son, you don't want to drink beer.  that's for daddies and"
23270,homer,"as a representative of the planet earth, let me just say [gets"
23281,homer,uhhh... the second one.  zillifone.  next question?
23285,homer,this interview is over!  
23286,bart,leonard nimoy?  what are you doing here?
23292,marge,these shirts are a hundred percent cotton.  and look at the fine
23303,bart,"but, what's with the glowing?"
23314,marge,"  all right, helen.  if i'm not wanted i'll leave."
23316,marge, ...and then they gave me back my $500 investment and
23317,homer,"wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  back up a bit now.  when are the"
23318,marge,"well, maybe it's all for the best."
23319,homer,"what do you need to make money for, anyway?  as long as i have my"
23321,marge,"well, we're trying to but you're blocking our way."
23326,homer,"no deal, mccutcheon, that moon money is mine!"
23329,marge,now you're the one who's being naive.
23341,homer,"uh, your fish are dead."
23360,bart,whoo!  we're number one!  we're number one!
23361,bart,"hey, what's going on?    wait, wait, hey..."
23363,marge,when can i start?  where's my territory?
23365,marge,don't forget fat people.  they can't stop eating!
23369,homer,"hey, what's all that commotion outside?  why, it's one of those"
23371,homer,"that's right, lenny.  let's all give in to deliciousness -- the"
23372,homer,  yeah!  homer's right!
23373,marge,welcome to pretzel wagon.  may i take your order?
23382,marge,excuse me.  i had this spot first.
23384,marge,"well, i guess macy's and gimbels learned to live side by side."
23388,marge, you see?  a little persistence and patience paid off!
23390,marge," i should've said ""limit"
23392,marge," ""hang in there, baby!""  you said it, kitty."
23393,marge,here you go!  free pretzel wagon pretzels for everyone.  one
23396,homer," that means ""thank you,"" marge!"
23398,marge,"oh, no!  no, don't do that!  you're suppose to be"
23402,bart,"cheer up, mom.  you can't buy publicity like that.  thousands and"
23403,homer,you could call them whitey-whackers.
23404,homer,i'm here to see mr. ormand.
23406,homer,"oh, i guess i should speak to the executor of his estate."
23408,homer,i've never reached to you before but my wife is in her hour of
23413,marge,no.  pretzel wagon's no longer...  300 pretzels?!  wait!  wait!
23414,marge,are you sure the children will get enough nutrition from these
23416,marge,oh my god.  what happened to your fingers?
23425,homer,hey!  fat tony!  you still with the mafia?  
23429,homer, you mean the mob only did me a favor to get something
23430,marge,hey! wh-what's going on?!
23432,marge,"oh.  oh, you have to push in as you turn."
23435,marge,homer!  did you tell the mafia they could eliminate my
23436,homer, in those words? ... yes.
23438,homer,"oh, thank god, it's only grampa.  "
23445,marge,"homie, maybe we should go inside."
23446,homer,"but, marge, that little guy hasn't done anything yet.  look at"
23448,lisa, what's going on outside?
23449,marge,"oh it's just a mob war.  go back to sleep, honey."
23461,homer,hey... that's the fire alarm.
23469,homer,"i think i won, mr. burns."
23472,homer,"so, mr. burns is gonna make us all go on a stupid corporate"
23475,bart,"think about it.  i mean, what team was babe ruth on?  who"
23477,bart,"sharing is a bunch of bull, too.  and helping others.  and"
23478,homer,hmm.  your ideas are intriguing to me and i wish to
23479,marge,"don't worry, kids.  this is a national park.  we can have lots"
23486,homer,"hey, this sounds like fun!"
23499,bart,"  mom, can lisa and i play outside -- away from"
23505,bart,i have a watch with a minute hand.
23514,homer,"yes, a lot of -- hysteria. "
23516,homer,"mr. burns, i insist that we cheat."
23518,homer,"wow, you sure know how to cheat, mr. burns."
23524,marge,"excuse me, sir?  i can't find my children."
23530,marge,there they are!  let me down here.
23532,marge," all right, kids, we'll meet you at the top!"
23535,homer,no going through the window for us!
23536,bart,is there maple syrup in this one?
23538,bart,"hey, i'm not gonna get fired.  is there any gold in this"
23541,lisa, mr. smithers!  mr. smithers!  i found another hurt
23543,homer,"you know, mr. burns, you're the richest guy i know.  way richer"
23545,homer,"oh, these sure are comfortable chairs."
23547,homer,"oh, man, you are so right.  did you ever sit like this?"
23549,homer, why get up?  here's a little move i've been tinkering
23553,homer,"use it wisely, my friend."
23567,homer,i think when we yelled we caused another avalanche.
23569,homer,shh.    you're... causing... more... avalanches.
23576,homer,we could build snowmen.
23579,lisa,"mr. smithers, mr. smithers!  that moose is on fire!"
23583,homer,"uh, they're just snowmen, mr. burns."
23597,bart,"did you hear that, lis'?  dad's gonna be just fine."
23600,marge,"we're over here, homie!"
23607,homer,"you said it, you weirdo!"
23614,bart,"ma, could you get me some milk?"
23615,marge,  can't you get it yourself?
23616,bart,"no, that's okay.  i'll just go without liquid."
23617,marge,"oh, all right, all right!  i'll get your milk."
23619,marge, does anyone else want anything while i'm up?
23625,lisa,"um, there's a hair in my soup.  but i'll just eat around it."
23627,lisa,"well, it's blue.    six feet long."
23636,homer,"marge, i was just watching women's volleyball on espn."
23638,homer,"now, sweetie, don't worry about a thing.  i'll teach you to comb"
23641,bart," ma, i need a glass of milk."
23644,lisa,i'll stop buying malibu stacey clothing.
23645,bart,and i'll take up smoking and give that up.
23646,homer,"good for you, son.  giving up smoking is one of the hardest"
23647,lisa,but he didn't do anything!
23648,homer,"didn't he, lisa?  didn't he?"
23649,homer,"all right, marge, i'll get you your nanny.  and to pay for it,"
23655,homer,"wait a minute, marge.  i saw ""mrs. doubtfire.""  this is a"
23656,marge,"homer, if you're going to do that to every applicant,"
23663,homer,i hide a bottle of schnapps in the baby's crib.
23664,marge,"i'm sorry, young man.  you're not what we're looking for."
23667,marge,i guess we're not going to find anyone.
23668,lisa,we have our own suggestions for the new nanny.  would you like to
23669,homer,"you have my undivided attention.  [meanwhile, in homer's brain,"
23677,homer,question two.  who was your last employer?
23679,homer," marge, do we know them?"
23681,homer,come on!  isn't he the guy i bowl with?  the black guy.
23683,homer,"oh yeah!    so!  you worked for carl, eh?"
23684,bart,"pop quiz, hotshot.  i'm supposed to be doing my homework, but you"
23687,marge,"my, she seems too good to be true."
23688,homer,i'll say.  her butt waxed the banister.
23704,marge,"that shary bobbins is a miracle worker.  the kids love her, the"
23710,bart,"sing us a song, shary bobbins."
23713,homer,"ooh, i can't get enough of this blood pudding."
23714,bart,the secret ingredient is blood.
23715,homer,"blood?  ugh!  i'll just stick to the brain and kidney pie, thank"
23717,marge,thank you for everything
23719,homer,you've changed me as well.  i'm no longer the money-driven
23725,homer,"shary bobbins, i want another beer."
23727,homer, you'll find it's even more fun if you get it
23729,bart,"lady, the man asked for a beer, not a song."
23737,bart,i'll get right on it.  
23739,bart,"i got a better game.  it's called ""whipping cupcakes."""
23749,lisa,we've crushed her gentle spirit.
23750,bart,you people should be ashamed of yourselves.  [whips another
23751,marge," shary, you did the best you could.  but you can't"
23761,lisa,do you think we'll ever see her again?
23762,homer,"i'm sure we will, honey.  [shary is sucked into a passing plane's"
23765,marge,you're missing the itchy & scratchy show.  don't you like it
23767,bart,"well, yeah, mom.  i mean, we love you and dad too, but god knows"
23768,marge,an occasional hug is all i ask.  
23769,bart, mom!  you can hug me when i'm asleep.
23782,marge,i need to purchase a brassiere.  you kids wait over here in the
23783,bart,"oh, can't we just wander around and meet you back here later?"
23784,marge,"mmm...okay, just be careful."
23786,bart, sounds good to me!  let's go!
23789,lisa,why is that mirror sneezing?
23835,bart,"hey, lis, look!  they're adding a new character to itchy &"
23836,lisa, adding a new character is often a desperate attempt to
23840,bart,haven't you ever listened to yourself on a tape recorder?
23841,homer,i prefer to listen to cheap trick.
23850,homer," ruff, ruff!  i'm poochie, the rockin' dog!"
23852,homer," oh, no attitude, eh?  not in your face, huh?  well, you"
23854,homer,"huh?  i can't, i don't remember what i did."
23856,homer," oh, i don't get the job, do i?  we-ell boo-hoo!"
23862,homer,how'd you get to be so good?
23866,homer,is this cartoon going on the air live?
23870,homer,i'll field that one.  let me ask you a question.  why would a
23873,homer,what the hell are you talking about?
23881,bart,i'm not a girl!  are you blind?
23891,homer,quiet!  you're missing the jokes!
23895,homer,"so, it was pretty okay, huh?"
23896,bart,"mom, can we go to bed without dinner?"
23898,homer,"well, at least i liked it.  didn't i?"
23902,lisa,you can't be cool just by spouting off a bunch of worn-out
23904,marge,bart's right.  let's none of us have a cow.
23906,bart,"hey, i know it was great, but what right do you have to complain?"
23908,bart,what?  they're giving you thousands of hours of entertainment for
23912,homer,"one, poochie needs to be louder, angrier, and have access to a"
23914,homer,then they said they were going to kill poochie off!
23917,homer,i won't let them treat poochie like dirt anymore just because
23925,bart,"wow, poochie came from another planet?"
23930,bart,"tough break, dad.  i guess people just weren't ready for poochie."
23932,marge,"oh, then i guess this is good-bye, roy.  maybe we'll see you in a"
23933,bart,"it's back to the basics, classic ""itchy & scratchy."""
23934,lisa,we should thank our lucky stars that they're still putting on a
23937,marge,"well i never thought it would come to this, but i guess we'll"
23938,lisa,"oh mom, are you sure you want to sell a family heirloom to pay"
23939,marge,i'm sure she'd be proud that her descendants had piping hot tap
23945,bart,"  hey, lis, check it out"
23946,homer,  ow!!  ohh!  what happened?
23947,lisa,"wow!  an actual robot from the movie ""clank clank! you're dead!"""
23948,bart,"aw, boo hoo.  that's what they get paid for."
23950,marge,"  oh, homer, look!  look, a tv guide owned by jackie o."
23952,homer,give her a break!  her husband was killed!
23953,marge,i have something that i'd like to sell.
23955,marge, no.  it's an heirloom my grandmother passed
23956,lisa,please don't construe our ownership of this as an endorsement of
23958,marge,"oh, no.  oh, no, no, no, no.  it's a very, very old figurine."
23960,marge,well... i guess it'll always be a monument to grandma's secret
23962,homer,"no.  how can you love a box, or a toy or graphics?  you're a grown"
23964,homer,"oh, yeah.  like when a clown dies."
23966,homer,and that kinda stuff is worth money?
23968,homer,"man, you should come over to our place.  it's full of valuable"
23970,homer,i practically insist!  shall we say five o'clock?  the snacking
23975,lisa,  hi-c and fluffernutters!
23978,marge,not really.  they just had corn on them.  kitchen...  corn...
23980,homer,oww!  why you little...!
23981,bart,aaah!  dad!  dad!  company!  company!
23982,homer," oh.  i'll just be another minute, john.  have a seat."
23983,homer,that john is the greatest guy in the world.  we've gotta have him
23984,marge,"hmm, i don't think he's married, homer."
23985,homer,"oh, a swinging bachelor, eh?  well, there's lots of foxy ladies"
23986,marge,"homer, didn't john seem a little... festive to you?"
23987,homer,couldn't agree more.  happy as a clam.
23988,marge,  he prefers the company of men!
23990,marge,"homer, listen carefully.  john is a ho - mo..."
23995,homer,"ohmygod ohmygod ohmygod!  oh my god!  i danced with a gay!  marge,"
23996,marge,you're being ridiculous.
23997,homer,"am i, marge?  am i?  think of the property values.  now we can never"
23998,marge,"i'm very sorry you feel that way, because john invited us all out"
23999,homer,"woah-ho-ho, not me!  and not because john's gay, but because he's a"
24000,marge,what on earth are you talking about?
24001,homer,"you know me, marge.  i like my beer cold, my tv loud and my"
24002,homer,i'm not setting foot outside this house until that man is gone!
24003,bart,"oh, dad!  you are the living end!"
24004,bart,"hey, where'd that cool creepy santa come from?"
24010,bart,"that was a killer tour, man!"
24011,lisa,i never realized how many celebrities humuliated themselves right
24016,bart,"hey dad, look what i got!    zzap!  zzap!"
24017,homer,baart!  where'd you get that shirt?
24018,bart,i dunno.  came out of the closet.
24020,homer,"marge, the boy was wearing a hawaiian shirt."
24022,homer,there's only two kind of guys who wear those shirts
24023,marge,"so, if you wore a hawaiian shirt, it wouldn't be gay?"
24026,marge,"i don't, but i loved hearing it!"
24027,homer, yyyou!  i should've known!
24029,marge,homer!  john brought us cactus candy!
24030,homer,"look, john, you seem like a perfectly nice guy and all, just stay"
24033,homer,"you know!  it's not... usual.  if there was a law, it'd be"
24034,marge,"oh homer, please!  you're embarrassing yourself."
24035,homer,"no i'm not, marge!  they're embarrasing me.  they're embarrassing"
24037,homer,"yeah, and that's another thing!  i resent you people using that"
24038,homer,"don't worry, boy.  we're gonna set you straight.  by tomorrow"
24039,bart,"what are you talking about, homer?  where are we going?"
24040,homer,just a couple of good old-fashioned manly places.
24043,homer,"just remember, son, no matter what happens, i'll always love you."
24045,homer, as a father!  a father!  regular father.
24046,bart,what am i supposed to do here?
24047,homer,nothing.  just sit.  i'll be back.
24048,homer,"well, it's been two hours.  how do you feel?"
24049,bart,i dunno.  i kinda want a cigarette.
24050,homer,that's a good start.  let's get you a pack.  what's your brand?
24052,homer," okay, that didn't work."
24054,homer,"bart, i want you to shake hands with -- what's your name, fella?"
24056,homer,roscoe here runs this mill.  he's gonna show us around to let you
24057,bart,why the hell would i wanna see that?
24058,homer, you'll thank me on your wedding night.
24061,homer,  has the whole world gone insane?!
24067,bart,"dad, why'd you bring me to a gay steel mill?"
24068,homer, i don't know!  this is a nightmare! you're all
24070,homer,oh!  my son doesn't stand a chance!  the whole world's gone gay!
24073,homer,... and the entire steel mill was gay.
24077,homer,but what would turn bart into a man fast?  you have to think for
24081,homer,"stand aside, marge, i'm taking the boy deer hunting.  he's going to"
24082,marge,"what?!  you never went hunting before, and you're perfectly"
24083,homer,oh yeah?  how long since you've had a baby?
24084,lisa,"but dad, it's barbaric.  how does killing a deer make you more of a"
24085,homer,it just does.  name me one gay indian.
24087,homer,"butt out, buttinsky.  what would you know about hunting?"
24089,homer,"hang on to it, toy-boy!  you might need it when it starts raining"
24091,bart,you guys going to teach me to drive?
24093,homer,"  no, boy.  you can't drive.  you're only"
24095,bart,nope.  something about a bunch of guys alone together in the
24096,homer,"that is a very immature attitude, young man."
24100,homer,"aw, she'd never go.  she's a vegetarian."
24103,lisa,no.  they were just going to find a deer and make bart shoot it.
24106,homer,"hey, boy, wake up.  your old man found some deer."
24108,bart,"hey, wait, man.  those are reindeer!"
24109,homer,"yep.  and it's your shot, son."
24110,bart,what?  i'm not gonna shoot a reindeer in a pen.
24111,homer,"come on, boy.  be a sport and kill blitzen, okay?"
24114,homer,"bart, i'm gonna turn my back, and when i turn around, i wanna see"
24115,bart,"no, don't!  you have to protect yourself!"
24116,homer,"son, there comes a time in every father's life when he must..."
24118,homer,just... my bones... and organs.
24119,homer,"look, bart!  it's santa claus!"
24120,bart,"woah, it's santa all right.  and he is kicking ass!"
24123,marge,"oh, homie, i'm so glad you're safe.  "
24125,bart,how'd you know that thing would work?
24131,homer,"hey!  we owe this guy, and i don't want you calling him a sissy."
24134,lisa,this is about as tolerant as dad gets so you should be
24135,homer,"you know, bart, maybe it's the concussion talking, but any way"
24140,bart,inside every hardened criminal beats the heart of a ten-year-old
24146,marge,"oh, you have _nothing_ to worry about, honey."
24147,homer,"your mother's right, bart.  sure, you're the one who _ruined_"
24148,marge,"we're _very_ proud of you, by the way."
24149,homer,"...and sure, he's probably so insane with rage that he'd butcher"
24150,marge,"but, he's safely locked away."
24151,homer,in a medium-security prison.
24153,homer,unless he gets out somehow.
24155,homer,or so you'd think!  except he's done it _so_ many times before.
24172,bart,"and god bless mom and dad and lisa and maggie.  and please, god,"
24174,bart,"it's him or me, o lord.  [marge struggles to unclasp bart's"
24175,marge,you can't ask god to kill someone.
24176,homer,yeah.  you do your own dirty work.
24196,bart,"he's planning something evil, i know it.  it must have"
24198,bart,"mmm, nah, that's not his style."
24205,bart,"mrs. krabappel, no!  that's sideshow bob!"
24208,bart,i won't be happy until i find out what you're up to.  wherever
24218,lisa,"hey, you said we were going to dairy queen."
24219,bart,i lied.  now help me rummage through bob's trash for clues.  then
24224,bart,he's more the same than ever.  and i know where the evidence is.
24225,lisa,bob's trailer at the construction site?
24227,lisa,what were you thinking?
24230,bart, i think he may have spotted us.
24232,lisa,then you must have had your eyes closed when you embezzled it.
24238,lisa,"oh, it's hopeless, utterly, utterly hopeless."
24242,bart,"let's go again, let's go again!"
24244,lisa,"um, do you know what you're doing?"
24249,bart,throwing me off a dam?  isn't that a little crude for a genius
24252,bart,yeah.  i guess that means you can't ever try to kill me again!

24266,marge,"ooh, that sounds fabulous, homer.  stores throw the best"

24273,lisa,"that's a trust, janey.  a sacred trust."
24276,bart, all the best bands are affiliated with satan.

24282,lisa,"yes, he had a brother named rod, who was two space years"
24284,bart,you made all that money for sitting around and watching tv
24285,lisa,"there's a lot more to it than that, bart.  i don't just"
24286,lisa,"bart, i know you're not wild about having me for a"
24288,lisa,"you should wash up for dinner.  to make it fun, you can use"
24290,bart,"may i have some more lima beans, please?"
24295,lisa,"uh, maybe you should eat the ones you have."
24296,bart,i didn't say i was gonna eat them.  i just want to look at

24298,bart,"oh, i'm a baby, huh?  well then i'll act like a baby. [takes"

24303,lisa,"bart, that's coffee ice cream.  it has caffeine in it!!"
24304,bart,"welp, at least that'll make things more interesting for you,"
24305,marge,"ooh, it's so beautiful!  this is what i imagine paris must be"
24307,marge,i'm so honored that springfield has been chosen to host to

24325,bart,you didn't say which bed!
24329,bart,"if you want me, you gotta catch me!"
24330,lisa,"don't worry, bart.  everything's gonna be just fine.  i'm"
24331,lisa," please, maggie...  please... go to sleep!!"
24347,lisa,"hey, bart.  how's your arm?"
24348,bart,it's all right.  i was hoping they'd give me one of those

24351,lisa,"yeah, well, that's okay.  i can always sell seeds.  you want"
24355,lisa,aren't you afraid i might take drugs and injure your
24357,lisa,"um, okay, i'm sorry, can you hold on, please? [takes another"
24359,lisa,didn't you hear i almost killed my brother?
24363,marge,no!  no more drinking!  i'm tired of looking like the world's
24364,homer,"oh, honey, you're not the world's worst mother. what about"
24380,homer,"we're going out, marge!  if we don't come back, avenge our"
24382,bart,dad!  knocking over gravestones is bad luck!
24384,marge,what happened to you homer?  and what have you done to the
24386,marge,i don't think it had broken axles before.
24387,homer,"before, before!  you're living in the past, marge!  quit"
24388,bart," another gutter ball.  gee, homer, you"
24389,homer,yeah.  suck like a fox!  
24405,marge,what on earth happened down there??
24407,homer,"nothing, marge.  i think it must have been that bean i had"
24417,homer,"all right, men, get ready to blast off.  [slowly begins to"
24419,homer,... there's some dangerous crabgrass over here ...
24420,bart,i guess we could go to martin's party.
24425,bart," uh, mrs. k!  hey, it's"
24429,bart,"excuse me.  [walks off about twenty yards, and just stands"
24431,lisa,but seven goes into twenty-eight four times.
24451,lisa,"bart, how come you're not sick?"
24452,bart,"eh, i gave my oysters to the cat.  [points to an ill-feeling"
24453,lisa,i didn't.  i just wanted to leave.
24465,bart,you are never going to guess what i saw at martin's party
24470,bart,that's the best you can do?  you could have at least said
24500,bart,"oh, i can't take much more of this."
24502,bart,"you wouldn't happen to have any real cakes around here,"
24504,bart,"oh, can't i just turn the page for you?  [reaches for the"
24511,bart,"oh ...  i love you, edna krabappel."
24516,bart, you're not going to get away with this.
24519,bart,"oh, now, martin's scoring off me.  oh, that is it.  [gets"
24520,bart,"okay, crew, set your faces to stunned."
24523,lisa,"i was in the library at the time, but janey told me that"
24525,lisa,"yeah, krabappel.  they were naked in the closet together."
24527,homer,wait a minute.  bart's teacher is named krabappel?  i've been
24544,marge,"homer, bart's up there!"
24546,bart,did you check your pockets?
24547,homer,"[checks, and find that the remote was in his back pocket all"
24564,homer,"hey, does this mean that mrs. krabappel is a virgin, too?"
24574,bart,"i'm outta here.  skinny, krabby, catch ya later."
24577,bart,"oh, no problemo.  so i guess now you'll be getting married"
24582,bart,"aw, but you seemed like such a good couple."
24586,bart,"wow!  my own credit card!    thanks, santos!"
24587,lisa,you can't afford this.  how can you afford this?
24588,bart,ahh you've been all edgy and suspicious ever since i gave you
24589,lisa, what are you talking about-i don't need
24590,homer,"hi, marge.  hi, santa's little helper.  hi, kids.  hey!"
24591,marge,that's laddie!  bart says he won him at a church carnival two
24592,lisa,"...in a truth-telling contest, right, bart?"
24593,bart,"ah, to the best of my recollection.  yes."
24594,lisa,"hey, this says we should feed him lots of eggs and olive oil"
24595,homer,oh yeah.  a dog like this you have to feed everyday.
24596,bart,he's trained to do all sorts of stuff.  he can herd sheep and
24597,marge, some call it the dog that never
24598,homer,"gee, that dog has more education than i do!"
24604,marge,"homer, are you wearing a tie to impress laddie?"
24605,homer,do you think he noticed?
24608,homer,wow.  tv's kent brockman!  
24610,homer,"you want some puppies, eh, mr. brockman?"
24612,homer,"laddie!    come'ere, boy!"
24613,marge,"what's the matter, bart?  weren't you happy with him?"
24614,bart,"no, he just wasn't the right dog for me.  i'm sure he'll be"
24615,homer, he better know how to keep his mouth shut.
24616,homer,"well, crying isn't gonna bring him back, unless your tears"
24617,bart,you're right!  i'll do it.
24618,homer,rats.  i almost had him eating dog food!
24619,bart,i'm going to get the dog back!
24620,homer, the good dog or the bad dog?
24624,bart," ohh, i see.  you _hate_ him, so you gave him to"
24627,bart,_you're_ the guy who owns the dog?
24631,marge," lisa, what in the heck are you doing?"
24632,lisa,"oh, it's for my junior achievers club.  we're trying to"
24633,bart,"oh, recycling is useless, lis.  once the sun burns out,"
24634,lisa,"mom, mom!  you're mixing polyapolane with polyurethane"
24637,lisa,"and, you have to cut these up first.  otherwise, animals"
24661,marge,"homer, you didn't tell me mr. burns went broke and lost"
24662,homer,now i can't remember every little thing that happens in my
24663,marge,you told me about that candy bar you found three times.
24665,homer,"oh yes.  gather around, my son, and i shall tell you a"
24680,homer," here you go, honey.  [drops a can of duff into a"
24681,lisa,"dad, if you just drink one more i'll have a full bag."
24682,homer,"oh, but daddy doesn't feel so good."
24683,lisa,hm.  there's gotta be more trash around here somewhere.
24684,homer,"hey, why don't you try the old folks' home?  they"
24686,homer,"you're welcome, honey ... "
24692,lisa,"my name is lisa, mr. burns.  lisa simpson."
24694,lisa,hah!  i'd never help you.  you're the worst man in the
24698,lisa,"if i did agree to help you, you could only earn money by"
24700,homer,"see that, boy?  why aren't you making any business deals?"
24701,bart, i'll do it this afternoon!
24703,lisa,"not good money, really.  each can'll get you a nickel."
24707,lisa,"oh, i'm not doing this for the money.  i'm just happy"
24710,homer,"please be flanders, please be flanders, please be"
24714,marge,wow.  he went from stinking rich to just plain stinking!
24716,homer,"oh, you're so bad, honey!"
24717,lisa,you guys shouldn't laugh at him.  mr. burns has changed.
24722,lisa,"wow, even _i_ didn't know he was so committed to"
24723,marge,"lisa, nobody likes a gloater, right, homie?"
24728,lisa,stop!  don't recycle!  it's murder!  you're helping mr.
24731,lisa," oh, i can't get the smell of slurry out"
24732,homer,"i hope you learned your lesson, lisa.  never help anyone."
24734,homer,i made a bad mistake and lenny sent me home to think
24737,homer,it's all right.  i understand.  but we really could've
24738,lisa," um, dad, ten percent of a hundred and twenty"
24741,homer,"oh, i'd love to go with you honey, but i got a lot of work to"
24742,marge,"homer, the lord only asks for an hour a week."
24743,homer,well in that case he should've made the week an hour longer.
24745,marge,"hey, calm down.  you're wrinkling your church clothes."
24746,homer,who cares?  this is the best part of the week.
24747,lisa,it's the longest possible time before more church!
24748,marge,church shouldn't be a chore; it should help you in your
24749,homer,"it should but it doesn't.  now, who's going with daddy to"
24752,homer,we're going to get rid of the christmas tree.  it's
24753,marge,"no, no, i don't feel like going to a trash pile today."
24754,homer,it's your life.  we'll bring you back something nice.
24758,marge,sermons about constancy and provicitude  are all very well
24760,marge,"well, okay, i will volunteer."
24762,homer,"okay, who's up for some scrounging?"
24763,lisa,i found a malibu stacey with no head.
24764,homer,"[laughs.  a raccoon emerges from the ""basketball hat"" and"
24766,bart,maybe it's a box from the future.
24768,homer,what's going on?  wha -- why am i on a japanese box?
24769,marge,all done.  i swept the aisles and put all the collection
24785,marge,but you can't let a few bad experiences sour you on helping
24787,marge,"me?  but i, i, wait i can't, i ...    hello?"
24789,marge,"oh, well, this is um, the uh ... the listen lady."
24791,marge,"okay ... um, why don't you start from the top?"
24793,marge,"aw, that's ridiculous moe.  you've got lots to live for."
24796,marge,homer!  will you get that crazy box of off the dinner table?
24797,homer,"but marge, i'm obsessed with it.  where did it come from?"
24798,bart,"hey, if they got a picture of you, that means they can *see*"
24799,marge,that's ridiculous.  nobody is watching us right now.
24801,homer,"akira, can you read this for me?  "
24809,marge,"oh, lenny, i'm sure he'll like your wife no matter what she"
24811,marge,"oh.  well, it's time to start telling the truth.  now, when i"
24817,homer,yes.  this is homer simpson from america.  who may i say is
24820,homer,hello?  why am i mr. sparkle?
24822,homer,"well, i am mr. sparkle."
24836,lisa,"look, we got a package from the mr. sparkle company in japan."
24837,homer,"ooh!  [opens package, but only styrofoam packing peanuts"
24848,homer,that didn't explain anything.  all i know is that they stole
24851,lisa,hey!  it was all a coincidence.
24852,bart,"yep.  there's your answer, fishbulb."
24853,homer,"well, it was a good ride while it lasted.  come on kids,"
24857,marge,"reverend, i gave ned flanders some bad advice.  now he could"
24859,marge,"no, he's disappeared.  oh, i'm in way over my head.  i mean,"
24863,marge,did you see a man being chased by some young hooligans?
24873,homer,no!  run around in circles!
24875,marge,"swipe at the dominant male!  come on, ned, knock that monkey"
24876,marge,you've got to get him out of there.
24878,bart,they're going to kill him?
24882,lisa,"oh, those poor monkeys."
24898,homer,"[picks up one of grimes' pencils, spilling the rest onto his"
24906,homer,i didn't even know what a nuclear panner plant was.
24909,homer,"hey, you seem like a great guy, so i'll give you a little"
24911,homer,"oh yeah, they're always trying to screw ya.  "
24913,homer,"  hiya stretch, what's the good"
24916,homer,"so, how's it going, grimey?"
24918,homer,  wish i had a nickel every time i heard that.
24922,homer," oh, a five thir-teen.  i'll handle it."
24923,bart,"  hey, milhouse!  you want a job in"
24925,bart,"hey, i'm a busy man.  you want a job or not?"
24939,homer,okay.  do i have to do anything?
24940,homer,"oh, i can't believe it, i got an enemy.  me the most beloved"
24942,homer,"no, i won't accept that."
24947,homer,"oh, what am i going to do?"
24949,homer,do you think it might work without the fork in the eye?
24951,homer,"welcome to the simpson residence or ""casa de simpson,"" as i"
24953,homer,"it is, it is, but first, let me introduce you to my family,"
24955,homer,... and our beautiful baby ...
24957,homer,"... my daughter lisa, i. q. 156 ..."
24959,homer,see?  and my son bart;  he owns a factory
24961,homer,i dunno.  don't as me how the economy works.
24965,homer,"yes, that's me, and the guy standing next to me is president"
24967,homer,sure.  you've never been?  would you like to see my grammy
24973,bart,"he's got you there, dad."
24975,marge,"homer  homer, why aren't you at work?"
24976,homer,the car won't start.  i don't feel very good today.  i am at
24977,marge,you're afraid to go to work because frank grimes will be
24978,homer,"that's crazy talk.  you're crazy, marge.  get off the road!"
24979,marge," you have to face him sometime, and when you"
24980,homer,"no he won't, he hates me."
24981,marge,he doesn't hate you.  he just feels insecure because you're
24982,homer,"yeah, yeah, that's his problem, he's a nut!  it's not about"
24983,marge,well ... maybe.  but i bet he would be less crazy if you were
24985,marge,just a little more.  then he won't have any reason to resent
24994,lisa,can i go downstairs and see what dad's doing?
24995,marge,"i wouldn't bother him, honey.  he's making some sort of model"
24996,homer," marge, do we have any elbow macaroni"
24997,bart,"just a minute, van houten.  somebody needs to guard this"
24999,bart,"ah, no problemo.  here's a nickel for the coffee machine."
25001,bart,"milhouse, how could you let this happen?  you were supposed"
25010,homer,"well basically, i just copied the plant we have now."
25012,homer,"then, i added some fins to lower wind resistance.  [points to"
25025,homer,"  change the channel, marge."
25055,bart,"mardi gras, man.  when the big easy calls, you gotta accept"
25056,lisa,"chief wiggum, i can't wait to hear about all the exciting,"
25058,homer,"over there.  [points to the crowd, where big daddy and"
25094,homer,"  dad, is that really you?"
25096,homer,  call me when you get a karaoke machine.
25139,marge,"remember me, my name is marge,"
25140,bart,"step back, mom, it's bart's turn now!"
25142,bart,"wait a minute, whoa, whoa. [whistles to call the orchestra's"
25144,homer,i'm hiding from the-the-the-the ghost!
25146,homer,b-b-before the show you said we were having a special ghost
25147,marge,i said we were having a special _guest_ tonight -- mr. tim
25152,marge,"hello, dear.  how was work at the plant?"
25153,homer,"it's not a plant, marge, it's a tree, and i've nearly chewed"
25154,marge,"i know, and i made your favorite -- stakes!"
25155,bart,"hey, could you two close the dam door?"
25157,bart,but that's where we live.  a _dam_.
25160,homer,"now, before my boss comes, there's something important you"
25161,marge,"in a minute, homey, i have to get the door.  [goes to greet"
25164,marge,"inflation, trade deficits, horrible war atrocities ... how"
25165,homer,"well, i know one thing in this world that's still pure and"
25167,homer,"no.  candy!    sweet, sweet, candy!"
25169,marge,but don't you want to end world famine?
25171,marge,or save the endangered alaskan salmon?
25173,marge,well if you won't think of society's ills ...
25175,marge,"at least, think of our dentist bills."
25178,marge,"well, it's time to say goodnight."
25179,homer,i wish our special guest tim conway didn't have to leave
25181,marge,  he's just kidding.  we'd like to thank fox and
25182,homer,"well, that's all the time we have.  so this is the"
25183,bart,  hitchhike -- it's faster.
25186,marge,we're like this all the time!
25200,lisa,"it's not my nature to complain, but so far today we've had"
25202,homer," you really did it this time, bart!"
25203,lisa,when do you expect the ringing will stop?
25205,marge,i certainly hope  so.  [realizes she's
25206,bart," i know, i'll go to my room to think about what i"
25207,homer,"oh, no, your room is full of toys.  you're going to the, uh,"
25209,marge,"i tell you, chief, i just don't know what we're going to do"
25212,marge,no-o-o!  no drugs!  bart just needs a little discipline.
25214,marge,"you know, maybe chief wiggum is right.  military school is a"
25219,bart,military school?!  you lied to me!
25220,homer," well, i'm sorry if you heard, ""disneyland,"" but i"
25221,marge,"well, it certainly was nice of you to accept bart in the"
25224,homer,"if, uh, that happens, are we still charged for the entire"
25226,lisa,"they're discussing poetry!  oh, they never do that at my"
25228,marge,"well, they sure sucked the fun out of that poem."
25229,bart,"please don't make me stay, dad.  i'll do anything you say."
25232,homer,"son, for the last time, you're staying at military school."
25234,marge,"lisa, no!  this place is just a jail for children."
25239,lisa,all i want is the chance to prove myself.
25241,marge,"lisa, if you ever want to quit and come home, i'll be here in"
25242,bart, i want to quit and come home.
25243,marge,"aw, honey, i heard you the first time."
25251,lisa,is there any answer that i can give that won't result in
25261,lisa,"oh, grampa!  you're not busy, are you?"
25263,lisa,"uh huh.  so, anything else you want to talk about?"
25267,lisa,"bart, i got a cassette from mom and dad.  i thought we could"
25268,bart,"gee, lis, i'd love to, but this really isn't a good time."
25271,lisa,lisa!  you're talking to lisa.
25272,bart,i'm talking to ... no one.  
25273,marge," don't worry, sweetie.  it's very common to be"
25274,lisa," okay, i'm not going to give up.  solitude never"
25275,marge," you are my sunshine, my only sunshine, you make me"
25276,bart,"sorry i froze you out lis, i, i just didn't want the guys to"
25277,lisa," i'm tired of being an issue, bart.  maybe everyone"
25278,bart,"but if you quit, it'd be like an expert knot tier quitting a"
25280,bart,"i dunno, i was just looking at my shoelaces.  but the point"
25281,lisa,don't do that.  why should we both be outcasts?
25282,bart,then i'll just stick by you in secret.  like a sock maker
25283,lisa, will you stop looking at your feet?
25285,bart, my killing teacher says i'm a natural.
25288,lisa,this wasn't in the brochure.
25289,lisa," meet me at the eliminator after lights out.  p.s.,"
25290,lisa,"i can't do this, bart.  i'm not strong enough."
25291,bart,i thought you came here looking for a challenge.
25292,lisa,duh!  a challenge i could do!
25297,lisa,"well, at least they're talking to me."
25299,bart," you can make it, lisa.  i"
25300,lisa,"yes!  [she gets to the next platform, and climbs back down"
25301,bart,"lisa, it's over, you made it.  you can put your arms down."
25302,lisa,"i can't, they're stuck."
25307,homer," well, bart, did you make sure to return all the"
25308,bart,"sir!  yes, sir!  luckily, i am now trained in six additional"
25309,marge,"well, he seems to have gotten more confidence."
25310,homer,"uh, yeah, i've always said that the boy could use more"
25317,homer,"it's my car, and i say we're going to the lost city of gold!"
25321,marge,"homer, i don't want you driving around in a car you built yourself."
25322,homer,"marge, you can stand there finding faults or you can knit me some"
25324,lisa,"dad, you got a letter from the city of new york!"
25325,homer,pfft. throw it away. nothing good has ever came out of new york city.
25326,lisa,"dear motorist, your vehicle is illegally parked in the burrow of"
25328,lisa,"if you do not remedy this malparkage within 72 hours, your car"
25329,lisa,"dad, you can't judge a place you've never been to."
25330,bart,"yeah, that's what people do in russia."
25331,marge,great! we're all going to new york!
25332,homer,lousy bart with his money. all right new york! i'm coming back! but
25333,lisa,"dad, our baby pictures were in there."
25336,bart,that took too long! how come we had to transfer in atlanta twice?
25337,lisa,i say we should have paid the extra $1.50 and gotten a bus with
25338,bart,look. it's zz top! you guys rock!
25340,homer,"now remember, criminals prey on small town folk like us. so if"
25341,marge,"homer, you're scaring the children."
25342,homer,good! i don't want to spend one extra second in this urban death
25343,marge,the bus station is just one of the sites we came to see. we'll meet
25344,homer,"oh, all right. but not a minute later cause when the sun goes down"
25345,bart,"hey, immigrants! beat it! country's full!"
25357,lisa,here's a better idea. you give me your address and i'll write to you.
25359,homer,"{aww, c'mon, pick up the pace!}"
25361,homer,now what do you have to wash that awful taste out of my mouth?
25363,homer,blecch!  ew!  sheesh!  i'll take a crab juice...
25364,marge,are we still in little italy?
25365,lisa,"actually, i think we're in chinatown now."
25367,lisa," mom, are those rabbits dead?"
25368,marge,"no, no, lisa they're just sleeping, upside down... and inside out..."
25370,lisa,look at all those beautiful shoes!  i know they're made from animals
25371,marge,"mmmm, if only i didn't already have a pair of shoes."
25372,bart,"speaking of shoes, i don't care about shoes.  i'll meet you ladies"
25374,marge,stay where i can see you honey.
25375,bart,"excuse me, is this mad magazine?"
25377,bart," seriously though, my name is bart simpson.  my father"
25382,bart,wow!  i'll never wash these eyes again!
25384,marge,"you know, when i was a little girl i always dreamed of being in a"
25400,bart,"when i grow up, i want to be in the betty ford center."
25401,marge,you better start saving now.  it's very expensive.
25402,lisa, they're strapping down liza minelli.
25403,homer,"ah ha!  i've got it!  brain, how can i ever thank you?"
25408,homer,the boss says you're fired.
25411,bart,"hey, it's dad.  right on time."
25412,homer,"we're getting out of here, now! jump in marge! trust me. throw the"
25413,lisa,"what a magical city.  can we come back next year, dad?"
25414,homer,"we'll see, honey.   we'll see."
25424,lisa,ralph and i could do the report together!
25427,marge,bart?  why are you doing that?
25428,bart,our class is making refreshments for skinner's party.  these are in
25429,marge,"that explains the flags, but what about the dog food?"
25431,marge,mmmm...let's bake him a cake!
25432,homer,ooh!  a fresh batch of america balls! 
25446,lisa,"so, in 1966, a brave young man named seymour skinner enlisted and"
25448,lisa,sergeant skinner was a hero.  he risked capture many times behind
25450,lisa,"and, he survived to make it back to springfield, where he became the"
25468,marge,that's not a funny story.
25478,bart,"come on, get to the part where you steal his identity!"
25480,bart," oh, it's one of <those> stories."
25499,homer,"look, lady, obviously you have at least one son."
25506,bart,"hey, armin.  mrs. krabappel sent me.  i forged my dad's signature"
25508,bart,well i don't see how me signing homer's name is any different from
25510,bart,"hey, hey, hey!  easy there, you big impostor."
25514,marge,"not to us you're not.  i mean, how would you feel if you suddenly"
25516,marge,"my next door neighbor, religious guy?"
25532,lisa,"i admit sergeant skinner seems okay, but mr. tanzarian pulled"
25534,lisa,"his name doesn't matter.  ""a rose by any other name would smell as"
25535,bart,not if you called them stench blossoms.
25537,marge,i'd sure hate to get a dozen crapweeds for valentine's day.  i'd
25538,homer,not if they were called scumdrops!
25542,bart,"hey, america, you're so fine, you're so fine you blow my mind,"
25552,marge,"good morning, agnes.  mmm...how's your new son working out?"
25555,marge,and have ten items or less.
25557,marge,"now be fair, edna.  i liked armin tanzarian too, but he was at least"
25559,homer,"okay, once more.  where are we going?"
25561,homer,and why are you and the old lady in the car?
25564,marge,i came up with the idea.
25566,marge,because the streets of capital city are no place for three unescorted
25568,marge,because we couldn't find grandpa to sit for them.
25578,homer,"can i see your copy of ""swank"", armin?"
25591,homer,"now if you'll allow me, i think i have a solution that'll satisfy"
25593,homer,and we salute you for it.  now don't come back!
25595,homer,"oh, no we don't.  judge snyder?"
25603,homer,"oy, the way the bee gee's played,"
25604,marge,"movies john travolta made,"
25605,homer,"guessing how much elvis weighed,"
25607,marge,"and you knew where you were then,"
25608,homer,"watching shows like ""gentle ben"","
25610,homer,"disco duck and fleetwood mac,"
25611,marge,"coming out of my eight-track,"
25613,homer,"hey there, meathead, what are you watching?"
25614,bart,"aw, i thought i'd check out the warner brothers network."
25620,lisa,"but dad, i'm supposed to practice an hour a day!"
25622,lisa,you'll practice me...what does that mean?  is it supposed to be some
25623,lisa,"look bart, i have to practice my saxophone, and you can't stop me!"
25624,bart,"oh yeah?  my dear lisa, you are eight, and i am ten.  and in my two"
25631,homer,"aw, lisa, it doesn't look so bad."
25633,homer,"ew!  lisa, honey, if it'll make you feel better i'll destroy"
25635,homer,"don't worry, son, if that bothers you, i'll destroy something"
25636,lisa,"dad, you don't understand.  this saxophone is like my oldest friend."
25637,homer,you don't remember how you got it?
25639,homer,"oh, well!  it all happened in 1990!  back then, ""the artist formerly"
25640,homer,"now son, on your first day of school, i'd like to pass on the words"
25642,homer,lousy traumatic childhood!
25643,marge,"ooh, there's the bus!  goodbye sweetheart! "
25650,bart,b-i-(clap)-(clap)-o!  b-i-(clap)-(clap)-o!
25652,homer,"bart was feeling mighty blue,"
25653,marge,"it's a shame what school can do,"
25656,homer,"and that my children, is the story of bart's first day of school."
25659,lisa,yeah.  except you were supposed to be telling the story of how i
25662,marge,"homer, i can't get the baby to burp.  could you try it for a while?"
25663,homer,no problem.  i'll just give her a sip of beer!
25664,homer,"come on, maggie, it's miller time!   yes, it's miller"
25666,homer,"oh, my father gave me beer as a child.  'til i wrapped my little"
25669,lisa,"mom, can you tell me a story about how i got my saxophone and not"
25670,marge,"well sure, honey.  bart had just completed his first day of school,"
25672,bart,"hey, she's just giving the public what it wants"
25678,homer,brilliant!  i have absolutely no idea what's going on.
25679,marge,"homer, i want you to look at this drawing bart did!"
25680,homer," oh, it's beautiful!  oh, oh, let's"
25681,marge,"homer, stop.  will you please look at the drawing?"
25682,homer,"oh, all right.  what......aaah!!  burn it!  send"
25683,marge,i think we're going to have to get bart some help.
25685,homer,"bart, son?  you want to play catch?"
25687,homer,"when a boy doesn't want to play catch with his old man, something is"
25695,lisa,i am three and three eighths!
25698,homer,wait a minute!  she's right!
25700,marge,"that's wonderful!  but still, can't you do anything for bart?"
25701,homer,"marge, he's five, his life is over.  lisa's the wave of"
25704,homer,wow...just think of the possibilities!
25708,homer,"well, our little girl has a gift, and we're willing to do what"
25710,homer,i'll give you fifty bucks.
25713,marge,"look, i knew private school would be expensive, but i was hoping"
25715,homer, excellente!  muchos gracias seniorata!
25718,homer,our family was suffering through its worst crisis ever.  bart was
25719,bart,"uh, homer?  it's five years later, and i'm still miserable at"
25720,lisa,and my gifts are still going to waste!
25721,marge,and sometimes i feel so smothered by this family i just want to
25722,marge,i'll go start dinner now. 
25725,homer,"dad, what are you doing here?"
25728,marge,"well, grandpa, as long as you're here, we were telling a story that"
25730,marge,"ye-es...well, as if our troubles weren't bad enough, springfield"
25733,marge,"homer, have you seen the frozen peas?"
25735,marge,"now listen, if we can't afford private school, maybe there's some"
25736,homer,"uh-uh.  forget it, marge.  there is no way i am spending my"
25737,homer,"you lose, michealangelo's ""david""!  who's next?"
25738,marge,"mmm, it doesn't matter.  all these things cost money and we don't"
25740,marge,"well, there is that two hundred dollars we've been saving for the"
25741,homer,"oh, marge, but...we've needed a new air conditioner for years!  and"
25742,marge,i cannot believe this!  i'm trying to give our daughter a head start
25743,homer,"marge, name one successful person in life who ever lived without air"
25745,homer,no need for potty mouth just because you can't think of one.
25746,marge,but balzac is the name!
25747,homer," ""if if's and but's were candy and nuts..."" eh,"
25751,homer,"well, i admit it looks bad, flanders, but haven't you heard of ""let"
25753,marge,"and so, just as things looked their worst..."
25755,marge,"grandpa, what are you talking about?"
25763,bart,i wish i was interesting like you.
25766,bart, skinner is a nut!  he has a rubber butt!
25768,bart, the principal said potty!
25772,bart,"yeah, eat my shorts!   buttman!"
25775,homer,"well moe, this is it.  today's the day i get my new air"
25779,lisa,you have thirteen pickled eggs in this jar.  and one cockroach!
25785,homer,"so, what do you like, lisa?  vio-ma-lin?  tuba-ma-ba?  oboe-mo-boe?"
25787,homer,oh...saxo-ma-phone.  two hundred dollars?!
25790,bart,"wow, so that's how lisa got her sax!"
25791,homer,"next, i'll tell you the origin of maggie's pacifier!"
25792,marge,what origin?  we got it for $1.95 down at the safeway!
25793,lisa,"well, i really liked that story.  but it still doesn't fix this."
25794,marge,"you know, homer, i think we have some money in the air conditioner"
25795,homer,"oh, but marge!  am i doomed to spend the rest of my life sweating"
25796,bart,"yeah, not to mention lookin' like a pig, eatin' like a pig..."
25798,homer,will you get off my front lawn?
25802,homer,i learned from the master.
25811,marge,"homer, you know how unpredictable the french are. one minute they're"
25812,homer,"relax, i built a bomb shelter!"
25813,lisa,that's not going to protect us from anything!
25814,homer,"fine, then don't use it."
25830,homer,"you want me, come and get me!"
25834,homer,"marge, kids, you're alive!"
25835,lisa,all the layers of paint in this house made the perfect bomb shelter!
25844,marge,"that sounds beautiful, ned. and let me just say my family and i"
25845,homer,now that's the marge i married.  so! who wants to steal some
25847,homer,"(to marge, almost whispering) he's crazy."
25848,homer,(comes out of other side of matter transporter) hmmm!
25850,homer,"(not fond of the price, hearable in voice) ummmmmmm... two"
25852,homer,(annoyed) i said i'll take it!
25853,bart,"hey, dad, can i use the transporter sometimes? please, i swear i'll be"
25854,homer,"sorry, but this is a highly sophisti-ma-cated doo-wacky. if you don't"
25855,lisa,"(in another room of the house) ow, somebody just punched me in the"
25857,lisa,"mom, stop! (checks paper printed from the of matter transporter.)"
25858,homer,i think she's right. the pants are a dead-giveaway.
25859,lisa,there's one thing i still don't understand. when bart went through the
25860,homer,"oh, it'll turn up somewhere."
25862,lisa,"oh no, and i let him borrow my toothbrush!  well, that hideous"
25863,lisa,"(running away from freak-bart) mom, dad, help! he's trying to kill me!"
25864,homer,"nobody likes a tattle-tale, honey."
25865,marge,(disappointed) they're like this every rainy day.
25866,homer,"well, we were lucky this time. but it's all too clear that some things"
25867,marge,"homer, what are you doing?"
25868,homer,"something i should have done a long time ago. (to bart, angry) i'll"
25869,bart,"aaaaaaaaaahh! (runs away, homer follows)"
25870,homer,i'm gonna chop you good! that cost me thirty-five cents!! you're just
25933,bart,"hey, dad, how come you've never taken us to see a soccer game?"
25936,homer,"oh, i never heard of those people."
25941,marge,it's hard to believe this used to be an internment camp.
25942,bart,yo!  paella man!  wing one up here!
25953,marge,"homer, we've got to get out of here!"
25954,homer,"ooh, but i want to do some rioting. "
25957,lisa,somebody's got to stop them!
25958,bart,let's wait until they burn the school down!
25959,marge,"oh, my god.  homer, they're right next door."
25960,homer,"relax, marge.  if someone tries to get in, my burglar alarm will let"
25962,homer," what did i tell you, marge?"
25969,marge,wouldn't we all suffocate?
25971,homer,"let's get that, the suffocation thing."
25973,homer,"five hundred dollars?!  aw, forget it."
25975,homer,"i wouldn't have thought so either, but here we are."
25976,marge,"homer, we need something to protect this family."
25977,homer,"i couldn't agree more, marjorie.  you deserve peace of mind, and"
25978,homer,"i'd like to buy your deadliest gun, please."
25981,homer,i don't have to be careful.  i got a gun.
25991,homer,"ooh, i like the sound of that."
25993,homer,"oh, i don't need anything like that... ...yet."
25995,homer,five days?  but i'm mad now!
25996,homer,i'd kill you if i had my gun!
25998,homer," lousy big shot, thinks"
25999,lisa,dad...it's three a.m!  can't you mutter in your room?
26002,homer,"pushy kids think they can tell me what to do in my house,"
26003,homer,"now, i believe you have some sort of firearm for me."
26010,homer,"""potentially dangerous""?!"
26013,homer,"close your eyes, marge.  i've got a surprise for you!"
26016,marge, homer!  i don't want guns in my house!  don't you
26017,homer,i thought smithers did it.
26018,lisa,that would've made a lot more sense...
26019,bart,"hey dad, can i borrow the gun tommorrow?  i want to scare that old"
26020,homer,only if you clean your room.
26021,marge,mmm!  no!  no one's using this gun!  the tv
26022,homer,tv said that...?  but i have to have a gun!  it's in the constitution!
26023,lisa,dad!  the second amendment is just a remnant from revolutionary days.
26024,homer,"you couldn't be more wrong, lisa.  if i didn't have this gun, the"
26027,marge,"i'm sorry, homer.  no weapons."
26038,homer,"hi.  it seems if a gun can protect something as important as a bar,"
26039,marge," homer, you can't join up with these gun nuts!"
26040,homer,"oh, come on, be fair, marge!  for once in your life, be fair!"
26043,homer,"what?  oh, apu, i would never...or would i?  i've already gone this"
26044,homer,"i'll do it.  i'll rob the kwik-e-mart.  all right, put your..."
26045,lisa,"can you help me get my ball down from the roof, dad?"
26046,homer,"sure thing, honey. [he shoots it down; it deflates upon hitting the"
26048,marge,does anyone know where all my dinner plates went?
26050,homer,"mmm...you probably left them at work.  on another topic, guess who"
26051,marge,"homer, i told you this morning, no guns at the dinner table!"
26052,homer,you said the breakfast table.
26054,homer,"listen, if it'll make you feel any better, i'll put the safety on."
26055,homer,whoops.  guess it was already on.
26056,homer,"ah, i'd better just put it down."
26057,lisa,"no offense, mom, but that was pretty cool."
26058,marge," homer, i think you'd agree that"
26059,marge,...but this is the first time since we've been married that i've
26060,homer,"all right, marge.  i'll do it.  for you."
26062,homer,and i'm a wonderful man.
26065,bart,"first, it's fudgesicle.  and i know they're up here.  i just need"
26066,bart,and the next marksman is
26069,homer,"oh, i see bart gets to have a gun."
26070,marge,you lied to me!  you promised to get rid of this gun.
26071,homer,"i put it in a safe place, marge!  i mean, what are the odds the"
26072,marge,how could you?  of all the terrible things you've ever done in
26073,homer,"but marge, i swear to you, i never thought you'd find out!"
26074,marge,"mmm...until you decide what's more important, your gun, or your"
26075,homer,so this is the thanks i get for protecting my family?  then go.
26076,homer,do you know how to cook dinner?
26080,marge,so we need a place to spend the night.
26082,marge,why can't we stay here?
26085,homer,"ooh, the gun club's gonna be here any minute! "
26089,marge,"no you're not! [drags bart inside the motel, then sticks her"
26091,homer," here's some more chocolate curls, gun buddies."
26092,homer,anyone else want a beer?
26094,homer,i use it for everything!  watch me turn on the tv.
26106,lisa,"can we go swimming, mom?"
26107,bart,hey!  is that a camera in the ceiling?
26109,lisa, this bed is making me nauseous!  why won't it
26110,marge,"honey, it'll be morning soon, try to get some sleep."
26115,homer,"oh, marge!  there's so many things i want to yell to you!"
26118,homer,"oh, honey, please come home.  i need you!  it's dark in the house"
26120,homer,"it's gone for good, marge.  i finally realized, what's the point of"
26121,marge,"oh, homey...  come on, kids, we're going home!"
26126,marge,homer!  you said you got rid of the gun!  you lied to me!  again!
26127,homer," i know i said that, but what i secretly meant was..."
26129,homer,"the joke's on you, buddy.  there's no bullets in that thing!"
26132,marge,how did you know we were being robbed?
26134,lisa,did anyone stop that robber?
26137,homer,"now, wait a second! you doctors have been telling us to drink"
26139,homer,"oh, confused, would we?"
26143,marge," now, make no mistake. when i say 'first aid', i'm not"
26148,lisa,"hey, tubby! want another pop tart, tubby?"
26149,bart,i'm comfortable with the way i am.
26152,homer,"there you go, bart! pee-wee football will melt away those unsightly"
26153,bart,"yeah, but i could get seriously hurt!"
26160,marge,"he's going to need, uh... you know, protection."
26162,marge,i was thinking more of... protection... down there (points down).
26168,marge,c-u-p. i wanna c-u... oh my god!
26169,bart,"ok, milhouse, lets try out the new cup."
26181,lisa,thats right. a girl want to play football. how about that.
26185,lisa,well... football's not really my thing... after all... what kind of
26193,homer," hey, flanders! you're the worst coach this team has"
26194,marge,he's the only coach this team has ever had... and the season hasn't
26195,homer," yeah, well... he's wearing that hat like an idiot."

26951,bart,"springfield, springfield!"
26954,bart,"new york is that-a-way, man!"

26984,homer,"hey, he's not happy at all.  he lied to us through song.  i"
26990,lisa," because he was singing we overheard his plans,"
26991,bart, it still wasn't worth burns' song and dance
26995,homer, i knew i should've shut that window...
26997,homer, even the criminals are beginning to croon;
26998,marge," oh homie, this whole town runs on a tune,"
26999,bart, springfield swings like a pendulum do!

27004,bart,"hymns, here!  i got hymns, here.  get 'em while they're holy."
27007,homer," hey marge, remember when we used to make out to this"
27010,lisa,there is something worse
27011,bart,and it really does blow
27017,homer,"the experts say that if you want an animal to do something, you"

27022,marge,that backyard is a disgrace. now get busy.
27023,lisa,"that's a good suggestion, mom."

27025,marge," kids, i made some lemonade for you."
27028,marge, what the...? what are you doing in
27029,bart,"work was hard, so we quit."
27031,lisa,hard work made us quit.
27032,marge,"i see. well, then, no chores, no allowance."
27033,lisa,okay. we get our room and board free anyways.
27034,bart,and santy claus provides the rest.

27040,marge,but when i ask you to do yard work... 
27042,marge,you can't go on that.  you have a heart condition.
27043,homer,heart condition?  get out of here.
27044,marge,you had a quadruple bypass.  you nearly died.  don't you remember?
27045,homer,"obviously, i don't.  now if you get out of my way."
27047,homer, a novelty comb.  kings among men.
27049,homer,sure.  anything you want.
27054,homer, put down your stick.  we're here to work.
27055,bart,"starting today, we're carnies, just like you."
27068,bart,"we're natural-born carnies, dad. if only we weren't tied down"
27069,homer,"yeah. we should start our own game, where people throw ducks"
27074,bart,"um, hey dad, i.. i.. think he wants.."
27075,homer,"not now, son. daddy's talking to a policeman."
27081,homer, it's a ring toss game.
27083,lisa,"why did you shudder just now, mom?"
27087,marge,how long are those roustabouts going to be staying here?
27088,homer,"oh, it won't be long. once their resume` gets out, they'll have"
27090,marge,"so, mr. cooder, how long have you've been in the traveling"
27093,marge,"ooh, what a nice surprise. this is so generous of you, cooder."

27097,bart,yeah. you want a piece of this?
27098,homer,you call yourself the king of the jungle.
27102,homer,"honey, daddy's waiting for the detective."
27103,lisa,"bart, you're brushing your teeth with my twig."
27104,bart,so? i let you use my leaves.
27107,marge,we can't just give up on our house.  there's got to be a way
27108,bart,i say we set fire to the house -- kill them that way.
27109,marge,"we don't want to kill them, bart. we just want our home back."
27110,lisa, well...if we did set fire to the house..
27115,marge,there must be a way to outsmart them.
27116,homer," uh, you can't outsmart carnival folk.  they're"
27118,homer,"i've got a proposition for you, cooder."
27122,bart,"aw, you'll never make it, dad!"
27129,bart,thanks for letting me skip school to see the team come back from the

27151,bart,"c'mon, dad, the team's arriving!"
27155,marge,i've never heard of these movementarians. are they some kind of church?
27156,homer,"who cares <what> it is, the point is, these are some decent generous"
27157,marge,but what if they try and talk us into something?
27158,homer," marge, marge, marge... remember when those smooth-talking"
27159,marge,you bought four of them! thank god the check bounced!
27161,lisa,"watch yourself, dad, you're the highly suggestable type!"
27162,homer,"yes, i am the highly suggestable type."
27164,homer,"who the hell is that, some kind of leader?"
27169,homer,homer no function beer well without.

27192,homer,"now, wait a minute, moe!"
27206,homer,"i've joined the movementarians, and so have all of you!"
27208,homer,"all i had to give them was our life savings, the deed to the house and"
27209,marge,"i can't go along with this, homer!"
27210,homer," marge, when i join an underground cult i expect a little support"
27211,lisa,"dad, do you think you might have been brainwashed?"
27212,homer,i have not been brainwashed!  kill the girl...
27215,marge,i'm not leaving my home!
27217,homer,and it didn't cost us a dime.
27220,lisa,dad and all these other people are obviously the product of mental
27221,bart,"yeah, maybe it'll wear off, like his interest in cb radio."
27222,homer,"that's a negatory, good buddy!"
27223,homer,"see marge, our lives are so much better now!"
27228,homer, i've never been so happy!
27245,marge,"this is ridiculous, we're already married!"
27246,homer,"but marge, we're not <mass> married!"
27255,bart,"oh, i should know this one... the.. the leader?"
27257,homer,these lima beans are even better than the ones we had for breakfast
27258,marge,"homer, you know i always try to put the best face on everything, but"
27259,marge,"we hate it here, and your family wants to leave!"
27261,marge,"noooooooooo!!  alrighty, time for bed!"

27297,homer,the leader knows all and sees all!
27299,homer,and he's going to take us to a wonderful new planet!
27301,marge,"willie, i'm not sure we're making any headway here."
27303,marge,"homer, come back! that's my husband!"
27305,homer,"i'm glad i'm back, because the moment that sweet, sweet"
27308,homer,now i can show all of you what i've come to realise! the
27318,homer,just think. i turned to a cult for mindless happiness when i had beer
27320,homer,"and you, marge!  the bringer of beer!"

27334,marge,"oh, it's so late! you kids have to go to bed!"

27843,bart,but asking you was ralph's idea!
27851,homer,eh... it's my first day!
27861,homer,there's a question that's crossed out.
27863,homer,"i think i can make it out!   ""are you a homosex..."""
27867,homer,nice fella.  i wonder if he's gay?
27868,marge,"homey, i really don't think this navy thing is a good idea.  what if"

27924,marge,"i'm so proud of you, homey!"
27925,homer,then i'll whomp him with my hat! 
27927,bart,i'd like to get my ear pierced.
27929,bart,"hello, everybody!  sparkle, sparkle!"
27931,lisa,"an earring, how rebellious!  in a conformist sort of way."
27932,marge,what on earth possessed you to get an earring?
27934,marge,if milhouse jumped off a cliff...
27935,bart,milhouse jumped off a cliff?!  i'm there!
27936,homer,"get back here, boy.  you're a disgrace to this family and its proud"
27937,bart,"well, i'm keeping this earring and you can't stop me!"
27938,homer,oh...i always thought lisa would be the one to get her ears pierced.
27943,homer,"""nuc-u-lar"".  it's pronounced ""nuc-u-lar""."
27947,homer,"oh, lisa, it's just war games.  it's not like a game could hurt me."
27948,marge,are you sure you'll be okay?
27949,homer,we have orders not to fire on anybody but greenpeace!  
27950,bart,"come on, dad.  didn't you ever do anything wild when you were a kid?"
27951,homer,"well, when i was ten i got my ear pierced.  but this is completely"
27954,homer,"uh, is the poop deck really what i think it is?"
27968,homer,and you're like the father i never visit.
27979,homer,"hmm, what would the captain say in my spot?"
27983,homer,"damage report, mr. moe."
27985,homer,enough of what's out!  what's in?
27987,homer,"yes, he is handsome in an ugly sort of way."
27992,lisa,i told him that photo would come back to haunt him.
28004,homer,"mr. moe, prepare to surface!"
28008,homer,uh...it's my first day!
28013,marge,a dishonorable discharge.  it's the best we could've hoped for!
28014,homer,you can't spell 'dishonorable' without 'honorable'!
28015,lisa," i think you're a hero, dad!"
28016,homer,"well, i couldn't have done it without bart.  boy, i guess i was wrong"
28017,bart,"hey, can i get a tatoo that says ""bite me""?  you never know when it"
28021,bart,weapons-grade plutonium?
28029,homer,"ohh, will this horrible year never end?"
28041,homer,"marge! how many kids do we have? oh, no time to count, i'll just"
28042,marge,"homer, you know we don't h--"
28043,homer,"shut up, shut up! if i don't hear you it's not illegal!  ok, i need"
28044,marge,homer! i painted that for you!
28045,homer,"ok, marge, if anyone asks, you require twenty four hour nursing care,"
28057,homer,"ok, but could you pay me under the table?  i"
28058,homer,does this make me look fat?
28059,lisa,"no, it makes you look like a tool of government opression!"
28061,homer," hey, so you're watching the ballgame. looks like a good"
28063,homer,"how about you, lenny? testing, testing... lenny?"
28065,homer,maybe. but first i need to hear about some other crimes to get me
28068,homer,"uh... like those, but involving you!"
28070,homer,barney? that was me!  and i'd do it again...
28074,homer,"oh, that's ridiculous, moe.  end transmission."
28078,homer,"i'm homer simpson, your trusted employee..."
28080,homer,uh.. i don't know what to tell ya!
28088,homer,"oh no, we're never gonna make it! let's just divide up the trillion"
28091,homer,"but i can't leave the country, what about my wife and kids?"
28094,homer, we'd better do what he says!
28122,homer,mr. burns.. i think we can trust the president of cuba..
28126,homer,"it's hard to believe there's a place worse than america, but we"
28140,bart,"you owe me a quarter, i didn't crack my skull."
28145,lisa, i know.  i already jumped to that conclusion.
28150,bart,the man knows quality work.
28151,lisa,and i'll be able to tackle all the hard-hitting children's news the
28152,marge,"oh, honey, i'm so proud of you.  all your hard work and grade-"
28154,lisa,"well, we used to date.  plus he threatened me."
28155,bart,"well, don't worry about sports.  i got that covered."
28156,lisa,"back off, bart.  this may be the only chance i get as a second-grader"
28158,marge,"oh, let your brother do sports."
28160,marge,"that ""mom"" stuff doesn't work on me!"
28161,bart,"so, we meet again, mr. bond!"
28162,lisa,bart!  get out of my anchor chair!
28164,lisa,"come on, this isn't a joke!  all over town, kids are just waking up"
28167,homer,"i'd like a monkey, please!  and...maybe one of those dogs, what do"
28169,homer,do they do any other tricks?
28173,homer,"oh, i'm not handicapped!  i'm just lazy!"
28175,homer,mind if i take him for a ride?
28178,bart,"bart simpson telling you to lock the doggie in the barn, because here"
28182,lisa,"sorry, bart, but you gotta take some things seriously."
28185,bart,"ooh, that's gotta hurt! "
28186,bart,"anchorman, huh?  well, if i'm gonna be an anchorman, i'd better go"
28187,lisa,i don't need a co-anchor.  i'm a straight-a student!
28191,lisa,'zork'?  what is 'zork'?
28193,lisa,"but that trivializes the whole idea of kidz newz!  i mean, let's"
28195,marge,why didn't you tell me you were bringing home a filthy monkey?
28196,homer,"this ""filthy monkey"" made the orange juice you're drinking!"
28198,marge,"honey, i'd love to reassure you, but right now mommy needs a"
28199,bart,"mr. brockman, i need your help.  i've got to become a great anchor"
28202,homer,"marge, the kids are on!"
28203,marge, the monkey's on my part of the sofa.
28204,homer,"honey, he's clearly marked his territory."
28208,homer,"marge, can i get a duck?"
28209,marge,you already have a monkey!
28212,lisa,"that wasn't news.  that was sappy, manipulative drivel!"
28213,bart,"well, i'm sorry you couldn't feel for old joe. [puts his hands on her"
28214,lisa," you didn't feel for him either, you big fat phony!"
28218,lisa,they want cheap sentiment?  i'll pump 'em so full of sap they'll be
28219,lisa,"hmm, thank you bart, for yet another touching ""bart's people"".  now,"
28220,bart,i just think our veterans deserve a little recognition.
28221,lisa,"that's what veteran's day is for, bart."
28222,bart,but is that really enough to honor our brave soldiers?
28223,lisa,"eh, heh, heh...they also have memorial day."
28224,bart,"oh, lisa, maybe you're right, maybe you're wrong!  the important"
28226,bart,well maybe they should have three.  i'm bart simpson.
28227,marge,"oh, my!  look at all these letters from people who want to be"
28228,bart,"i wish they all could be ""bart's people"", mom.  i truly do."
28229,marge,"i'm proud of you, honey.  you're finally giving something back to"
28230,bart,hm.  really makes you think.
28231,lisa,"what does that even mean?!  mom might not see through you, but i do!"
28232,bart,"well, if i'm guilty of anything, maybe it's caring too much.  i'm"
28233,lisa,"stop talking like that, stop it!!"
28234,lisa,"hey!  here's another letter for ""bart's people""!"
28235,bart,"oh!  so many souls, so little air time."
28236,bart," ""dear bart, i came to this country hoping to share the"
28237,lisa," oh, how terrible-read-on."
28238,bart," ""should i abandon hope or fight on bravely against"
28240,bart,"i'm gonna put him on the air tonight, live!"
28241,lisa,"oh, bart, you'll have to ride your bike pretty fast to get out there"
28242,bart,"no, i'll just take the chopper. "
28243,lisa,they gave you a chopper?!
28244,marge, you said this monkey would be sweeping
28245,homer,what do you want?  his cholesterol's through the roof.
28246,marge,"i want you to take that monkey back, so he can be rehabilitated and"
28247,homer,"no, no, he's fine!  go on, mojo!  show marge your happy dance!"
28250,lisa,"no, you can't hurt bart!  he's... well... he's your son!"
28252,lisa,"well, not literally.  but, in a way...isn't he everyone's son?"
28255,lisa,"boy, that phony schmaltz of yours sure is powerful stuff!"
28256,bart,"uh, yeah, but i have a certain respect for that whole truth"
28257,lisa,"you know, bart, if we combine your showmanship with my"
28258,bart,"you're right!  if we work together, there's no stopping us"
28262,lisa,i can't believe they canceled us for this s...
28263,bart, shut up!  i'm trying to watch this!
28268,homer,they didn't have lord huggington?
28269,marge,"it's the same basic bear, homey."
28271,lisa,"it's full, dad, that means you have to take out the trash."
28272,bart,"yup, that's the rule.  ""he who tops it off, drops it off."""
28273,homer,"nuh-uh.  ""it isn't filled until it's spilled."""
28274,homer,"good news, everyone!  i got in a fight with the garbage men and"
28275,marge,"oh, lord, now what are we going to do?  just let the trash pile up?"
28276,homer,"hey, i'd rather live in a dump than in a world run by snooty"
28277,lisa,"dad, is this another one of those situations that could be solved by"
28278,homer,"i never apologize, lisa.  i'm sorry, but that's just the way i am."
28279,marge,"homer, that crazy lady who lives in our trash pile attacked me again."
28280,homer,that's not the way she tells it.
28281,marge,and the school nurse says bart has the plague.
28282,homer,"eh, it's like the measles.  good to get it out of the way!"
28283,marge,"homer, this has gone far enough!  will you please just apologize to"
28284,lisa,"yeah, dad, you're always telling me and bart to apologize."
28285,homer,"yeah, but i'm always secretly disappointed when you do.  anyway, i"
28286,bart,i think you're startin' to crack.
28287,homer,apologize for that remark!
28290,homer,"this is a very, very proud day for us!  especially me, your"
28292,homer,"and to think, you wanted me to crawl, marge.  well, this man"
28293,marge,"aw, homer, you didn't beat city hall!  they picked up our trash"
28294,homer, you signed my name?  i feel so violated.
28295,marge,you've signed my name lots of times!
28296,homer,but this isn't like a loan application or a will!  you've signed away
28299,homer,i want to register to run for sanitation commissioner!  and tell
28303,bart," hey, everybody, vote for my dad, homer simpson.  if you"
28304,homer," why you little... er... no one's gonna beat you, son."
28306,homer,"what am i, the answer man?  just vote for me."
28311,homer,"that's a good question, bono.  'cause i'd be the most whack, tripped"
28314,homer, can't someone else do it?
28320,homer,"""can't someone else do it?"""
28322,lisa,"aren't you gonna buy it, dad?"
28323,homer,"fifty cents?  huh, not likely."
28326,homer, uh...oh no!  wait!  i think i've got the perfect solution.
28329,homer,oh...patterson was right!  i'm crashing and burning!
28330,marge,how could you spend 4.6 million dollars in a month?
28331,homer,"they let me sign checks with a stamp, marge!  a stamp!"
28332,lisa,"you know, dad, there's a lesson in all this.  many cities have"
28333,homer,wait!  shut up!  i just thought of something!
28337,homer,"okay, before i show you, who wants to guess how i got the money?"
28340,marge,"i'll have to say drugs, too."
28341,homer,"close, but you're way off."
28342,marge,"good god, homer!  you're turning our wonderful little town into"
28343,homer,marge!  ixnay on the ashhole-tray!
28344,marge,i can't believe it's come to this.
28346,marge,"moving the whole town five miles down the road, it's crazy!"
28347,homer,"yeah, it's something all right."
28356,bart,wow! mcbain is really buffed up! you could grate cheese on those abs!
28357,homer,"yeah, but can he do this?"
28359,marge,(walking in) that's what i call break-neck speed! (laughs)
28361,marge,"hmmmm... anyway, it's time for the church picnic."
28362,homer,what? they had a picnic last week.
28363,marge,"no, they didn't! you just brought a bucket of chicken to church!"
28364,homer,"if god didn't want us to eat in church, he'd have made gluttony a"
28366,homer," yeah, out of the way, whoever"
28371,homer,"oh marge, how could you let me let myself go like this?"
28372,marge,me? i'm not the one who puts butter in your coffee.
28373,homer,well i've humiliated my son for the last time. i'm going to get into
28374,marge,"whatever you say, sweetie."
28375,homer,"no, i mean it, i'm really serious this time."
28376,marge,"ok, honey, ok. i'll start taking in all your slacks! "
28378,homer,don't you have anything healthy here?
28380,homer,"hey, these powersauce bars look pretty healthy."
28381,homer," ""a bushel of apples packed in every bar, plus a secret"
28382,homer,"phew, my head's gonna be sore in the morning."
28384,homer,"rainier wolfcastle! oh, i love our movies and your"
28386,lisa,dad! what have you done to your stomach?
28389,homer,i have been working out secretly at night. and look at me now!
28390,marge,"oh, my goodness gracious!"
28391,homer,"go on, try to find some flab."
28393,bart,"wow, you know rainier wolfcastle?"
28394,homer,"yeah, he helped me blast through the burn and ride the zone."
28399,homer,"if you're trying to scare me, it won't work. i'm 100% focused on my"
28402,homer,"well, goodbye everyone. don't touch my stuff."
28403,bart,"dad, wait. you're not risking your life just to impress me, are you?"
28405,bart,"woah, cool. now get going. chop, chop!"
28406,homer,"come on, you lazy sherpas, wake up! we've got a mountain to climb."
28409,homer,i'm going to climb this entire mountain on my own!
28411,homer,shut up! you are so fired.
28413,homer,"(reading a powersauce bar) hey, deng xiaoping died!"
28414,bart,"oh, dad's gonna die and it's all my fault!"
28415,marge,"don't worry, kids, your father will be just fine as long as he's with"
28419,bart,"hmmm, i'm guess that we don't have to go to school."
28425,bart,"milhouse, i'm not gonna take dog doo that's been on the dirty ground"
28427,homer," huh, what? i'm awake! i'm awake! i'm a productive member of"
28428,bart,"relax, dad, it's just me."
28429,bart,i was wondering if you had any industrial strength adhesive i could use
28430,homer,"well, let's see what we've got in the old drawer! [shuffles things"
28434,lisa,it's lisa! i just called to tell you how much i love you and can i

28436,lisa,"umm, i wasn't one hundred percent clear on that. she said something,"
28437,homer,"hmmm, so you wanna take the bus, huh? i don't know, that's a pretty"
28438,lisa,"well, if it would put your mind at ease i could take a limousine. but"
28439,homer,"$200?! ohh, isn't there any other way?"
28440,lisa,"hmmm, i guess i could take the bus if you think that's a better idea."
28441,homer,"frankly, i do. i know you had your heart set on the limo but sometimes"
28443,homer,"atta girl, i love you s--"
28445,lisa,"ahh, the old number 22. clean, reliable public transportation. the"
28454,lisa,"huh, how could i confuse bus 22 with 22-a. area 51! hah!"
28458,marge,"can you help him, doctor?"
28460,marge,what happened? you didn't do anything!
28462,bart,couldn't you have just turned the heat up a little?
28469,homer,"maaaaybe... but you don't know lisa, i mean, she's so smart they"
28471,homer,"yes, but now i have to leave on a totally unrelated matter. "
28472,lisa,"excuse me, could you tell me how to get to the museum?"
28477,homer,you have reached the office of homer simpson. if you are calling
28480,homer,"for god sakes, my little girl is--"

28490,lisa,"are you sure you don't wanna go to a doctor? i mean, a drawbridge did"
28491,homer,"no, i'll just walk it off."
28492,lisa,i'll never take another stupid risk like that again.
28495,homer,if i hadn't of taken a stupid risk with that cherry picker i would
28497,homer,stupid risks are what make life worth living!
28498,lisa,"dad, you're headed for the river again!"
28499,homer, feel your heart pumping a mile a minute! that's what my
28500,bart,"hey lis, i'm sorry i ruined your egyption thing. we're still buds,"
28503,lisa,have you ever seen such exquisite ushabtis?
28504,homer," eh, not this exquisite."
28505,lisa,oh my gosh! it's the mysterious orb of isis! archeologists have
28506,homer,"well, daddy will figure it out!"
28507,lisa,"it's a music box! dad, we uncovered the secret!"
28508,homer,"oh, so now it's <we>, eh?"
28509,lisa,"it's so beautiful! and just think, we're the first people to hear"
28510,homer,"any time, honey. just remember, never be afraid to live life on the"
28511,lisa,"it's kind of humbling, isn't it? the music we just heard might never"
28512,homer,"yeah, but it'll always live on because we'll never forget it. [begins"
28513,lisa,"dad, that's the old spice song!"
28514,homer,"it is? well, that's a good song too! [continues the song, and lisa"
28515,homer,"hey, look what was in here!  a program from that guy's funeral."
28517,homer,yeah!  yeah!  whatever happened to that guy?
28520,bart,oww!  that had a guidepin in it.
28528,marge,"well, maybe our next anniversary will be more romantic.  aww, look,"
28529,homer,you mean there's been cake in our freezer for eleven years?  why was
28530,marge,"look at this little plastic couple.  hmm, so full of hopes,"
28531,homer,"hey marge, wouldn't it be weird if they had little parties at night?"
28533,marge,"ooh, look at the good boy!"
28535,marge,"oh, yes he is!  yes he is!"
28536,homer,"hey marge, wasn't that great when the dog came in here?"
28537,marge,"oh, yeah!  he's really special!"
28539,marge,i love him too!  good night!
28542,homer,what?  aaah!  the food!
28543,homer,why did this happen?  why?!
28544,lisa,someone left the freezer door open and the motor burned out.  we can
28545,homer,okay.  it was just the shock of seeing all that food on the floor.
28546,marge,"when we got married, is this how you thought we'd be spending our"
28547,homer,"eh, i never thought i'd live this long."
28548,bart,when are mom and dad coming back?
28550,bart,"there's gotta be something to do around here.  hey, are they pulling"
28553,homer,shh!  we're trespassing!  and some of these farmers have pitchforks!
28555,bart,"yeah, what's with the love thang?"
28556,marge,let's just say the country air did us good.
28557,homer,"bart, i told you not to leave that tv on."
28558,bart,"okay, here's the deal.  crowns and dubloons are mine, snuff boxes and"
28563,homer,"sorry, guys.  marge and i are spending the weekend at a bed 'n'"
28566,homer,"nah, it'd just be awkward.  what with the sex and all."
28569,marge,"oh, isn't it romantic?  doilies and cozies as far as the eye can see!"
28570,homer,"if there's anything more exquisite than queen ann's lace, i haven't"
28571,marge,shouldn't we get started?
28572,homer,"um, eh, no time like the present."
28573,marge,"hmm, something's not right.  does this bed feel lumpy to you?"
28574,homer,"well yeah, kinda.  did that butter churn"
28576,marge,my heart's beating like crazy!
28577,homer,mine too!  just like back in that hayloft.
28578,marge,"you know, the fear of getting caught is kind of a turn-on."
28579,homer,there's that dirty girl i married!  come on.  i have a disgusting
28582,bart,exactly.  now there's nothing left out there but treasure.
28584,bart,"hey, you're back.  did you 'rock the casbah'?"
28586,lisa,do you know you have your hands in each other's pockets?
28587,marge,it's okay when you're in love.  and married.  to the
28590,marge,"you don't think there's anything wrong with what we're doing, do you?"
28591,homer,i don't think anything i've ever done is wrong!
28592,lisa,"wow!  an alternate ending to ""casablanca"".  bart, this could be"
28593,bart,"priceless like a mother's love, or the good kind of priceless?"
28594,marge," oh, this is so naughty.  coming back to our old love-nest."
28595,homer, it hasn't changed since that magical evening when i knocked
28596,marge,"oh, we drank so much that night!"
28597,homer,"yeah, i thought bart would be born a dimwit! "
28599,homer,"well, this time i'm drunk on love... and beer."
28601,bart,i'll say.  wasn't it great?  and the question mark leaves the door
28604,lisa,i'm just a little girl.
28617,homer,"oh, why can't they just play through?"
28624,homer,gil!  thank god it's you!  you gotta help us!
28626,homer,"i'm okay, honey.  now listen very carefully.  i want you to pull on"
28628,homer,why don't you take a picture?  it'll last longer!
28630,marge,it would have to be camera day...
28632,marge,i don't want you reading about those awful scandal sheets.
28633,lisa,"uh, i was just trying to find dave barry's column."
28634,bart,he's great!  he pokes fun at life's little foibles.
28635,marge,"kids, i want to explain about the stadium.  you see, sometimes, moms"
28637,marge,so they need to explore new ways to express their love.
28638,homer,scary ways.  but we never intended it to end like that.  with
28639,marge,all those eyes... just leering and leering at us.
28640,homer,who's in the mood for miniature golf?
28642,bart,"huh, they're going to feel so silly when they realize they forgot us."
28646,lisa,you have a pen glued to your cowlick.
28649,homer,"yo, apu!  give me the usual."
28651,homer,"mmm ... hey, this hot dog tastes different."
28653,homer,"yeah, but without the grease all you can taste is the hog"
28657,homer,used grease is worth money?  then my arteries are
28658,marge,homer!  that side of bacon was for my bridge game tonight!
28659,homer,"marge, if you don't mind, i'm a little busy right now"
28661,homer, no!  through savings and wise investment.
28662,lisa,"come on, bart, the bus is here.  "
28663,homer,where do you think you're going?
28664,bart,it's the first day of school!

28668,lisa,"don't worry, i'll help her out.  i remember how hard"
28671,lisa,did she just tell me to shut up?
28673,lisa,you'll want a locker in this hallway.  it's library
28676,lisa,"well, you'll definitely want to get yourself a good"
28678,lisa,"oh, jacks, jacks are big.  they went out for a while"
28680,lisa,"oh, don't worry, you'll pick it up fast.  once you"
28682,lisa,"uh, they were all wiped out in the big trophy fire."
28684,homer,"okay, boy.  this is where all the hard work,"
28687,bart,"dad, all that bacon cost twenty-seven dollars."
28688,homer,"yeah, but your mom paid for that!"
28689,bart,but doesn't she get her money from you?
28690,homer,and i get my money from grease!  what's the problem?
28691,bart,"uh, i don't know how much more school i can miss."
28692,homer,"oh, you'll miss plenty!  i have a feeling this"

28704,lisa,"so there i am, being nice to alex, and she takes all of my"
28705,marge,"i'm sure they didn't ditch you, honey.  maybe they went"
28707,lisa,they only like her because she acts so grown-up with her
28708,homer,lisa ... i can't imagine anyone being more likable than
28710,homer,"ah, ah!  think!  is that what alex would say?"
28712,lisa," huh, don't give it a second thought,"
28714,lisa,"oh!  earrings!  wow, thanks so much, alex!  oh, but"
28718,lisa,"aw, but ... i don't think i'm ready for pierced"
28723,lisa,"yeah, it's great!  we have pony rides, sing-alongs,"
28727,lisa,"yes you did, yesterday!  right by my locker!"
28729,bart,"when you want grease, go to the source.  good"
28730,homer,"oh, i'll say.  look at that red-headed kid."
28731,bart,i was thinking more of the deep-fryer.
28732,homer,"all right, we'll try it your way."
28737,homer,"if she didn't want her car ruined, she should've done a"
28738,homer,hey!  hey!  you're taking our grease!
28746,lisa,"aren't we a little young for make-up, and ... what"

28760,homer,"oh, i can't believe those goons muscled me out of my"
28761,marge,my poor homey.  couldn't you try some other far-out money-
28763,marge,you could raise some emus ...
28764,homer,"emus?  really?  ooh, that's pretty crazy.  nah, i'd only"
28765,bart,"hey dad, i've been thinking.  what if instead of giving up"
28766,homer,wait a minute.  the boy's right!  i can't quit now!  aww
28770,lisa,no doubt!  can't a girl fabulize herself before the

28779,lisa,"milhouse, oh, i've been looking all over for you."
28785,homer,"all right, son.  we're about to embark on our most"
28787,homer,"all right, screw it, let's roll!"
28788,marge,lisa!  i made you some homemade pepsi for the dance!  it's
28789,lisa,"thanks, mom, but i told you i'm not going."
28790,marge,"oooh, so you don't have a date.  you can still go and have"

28792,marge," aw, honey, a baby couldn't have organized a"
28793,lisa,"forget it mom, i'm not going."
28794,marge,but they're counting on you to take tickets.  and if you
28795,lisa,"mom, you can't possibly believe that."
28796,marge,"i have to, honey.  or, you can stay here, and we'll have"
28800,homer,"and now, we wait.  so ... is this your school?"
28803,homer,"uh, buh, buh, we're new foreign exchange students from ..."

28807,homer,wait a minute!  there's no angus mccloud in north
28810,lisa,"oh, i don't want to go in there, with all the happy"
28812,lisa,"all right, all right, dmy!"
28819,lisa,"it's because they are kids!  and so are we!  come on,"
28836,homer,"what are you talking about, marge?  i don't need a ..."
28842,homer,"oh ... marge, no matter what happens in the future, promise"
28843,marge,"okay, but you've accomplished a lot!  you've made me very"
28844,homer,"oh, yeah, they'll put me on a stamp for that!"
28846,homer,"i've wasted half my life, marge.  you know how many memories"
28848,marge,the kids and i want to show you all the great things you've
28849,homer,"oh, all right, maybe i can pinpoint where my life went wrong."
28850,bart,"quiet, dad, or we'll have to throw you out of here."
28851,lisa,there you are in outer space.  that's pretty impressive.
28852,homer,"eh, all we did was grow some space tomatoes and sabotage mir."
28853,bart,remember when you almost became heavyweight champ?
28856,marge,"well, there's certainly no greater accomplishment than"
28857,homer,"aw, i should've punted.  turn it off, turn it off!"
28858,bart,"hang on, dad, this next part will definitely make you feel"
28862,homer,"oh, stupid movies!    who invented these"
28863,lisa,"it was thomas edison, dad."
28864,bart,i thought he invented the light bulb.
28865,lisa,"that too.  he also invented the phonograph, the microphone,"
28866,homer,"no one man can do all that.  you're a liar, honey, a dirty"
28868,lisa,it's true.  i read it at a placemat at a restaurant.
28869,homer,"really?  a restaurant?  well, now i don't know what to think."
28870,bart,"dad, what are you doing here?"
28871,homer,reading about this edison character.  they won't let me in
28873,bart,they're all about smugglers.
28874,homer,"no, not this one!  ""the smugglers of pirate cove"".  it's"
28876,homer,i think it's pretty obvious that i am!  [holds up a
28880,homer,"yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, great story lenny.  but here's one"
28881,homer,"and he was a firm believer in fletcherism, and he played the"
28884,homer,"well, i remember where edison worked!  it was menlo park."
28886,homer,that's boring.  you're boring everybody!  quit boring
28887,homer,and then he worked on a machine to communicate with the dead.
28888,marge,"all right, already!  everyone knows the man accomplished a"
28889,homer,"oh, that's where you're wrong, marge.  he was a shameless"
28890,marge,"well, you're not thomas edison."
28891,homer,"marge, that's it!  that's why i haven't done anything with my"
28893,homer,and i'm starting right now.  no more damn pajamas!  [takes
28895,homer,"well, i quit my job, just like you said to."
28896,marge,i didn't tell you to quit your job.
28897,homer,"yes, you did!  i remember your exact words.  you said i"
28898,marge,"that doesn't sound like me.  well, i suppose if this doesn't"
28900,marge,something electrical might be good.
28901,homer,"weh, eh, eh, let me handle the creative end of this, marge."
28903,homer,"you look at this table, and what do you see?  just a table."
28904,marge,"homer, that's not a table, that's our dryer."
28905,homer," my files!  [opens the dryer, and several pieces of"
28906,lisa,"you started smoking, dad?"
28907,homer,yes.  thomas edison smoked several cigars a day.
28908,bart,"  yeah, he invented stuff,"
28910,homer,"as long as you're here annoying me, let's have a"
28911,lisa,okay.  um ... automatic ...
28916,homer,"mmm, hmm.  wait a minute, these aren't exciting new products!"
28918,homer,"look, i just wanna know how to invent things.  tell me!"
28920,homer,you mean like an electric blanket-mobile?
28926,homer,"okay, i have here the four greatest inventions in the history"
28927,bart, i'll buy ten of those right now!
28928,homer,"now, here's my ""everything's o.k."" alarm!"
28929,homer,"this will sound every three seconds, unless something isn't"
28931,homer,"it can't be turned off!    but it, uh,"
28932,homer,"now, this next one's for the ladies.  how many times have you"
28933,marge,that's every woman's nightmare.
28934,homer,that's why i invented this revolutionary make-up gun.  it's
28935,homer,now you're ready for a night on the town.  [holds up a
28936,marge," homer!  you've got it set on ""whore""."
28937,homer,"okay, this time try to keep your nostrils closed."
28938,homer,"oh, look what you did.  now i have to go get my cold-cream"
28939,lisa,"dad, women won't like being shot in the face."
28940,homer,women will like what i tell them to like!
28941,homer,"now here's something for everyone.  in the olden times, if"
28942,lisa,you expect people to go to the bathroom in their living
28943,homer,"sure!  believe me, every man in america will want to have"
28945,marge,"no, bart!    homer, all these inventions,"
28951,marge,i'm not saying you're a bad inventor ... i'm saying these
28952,homer,but this is the best i could do.  i guess i'm no better at
28953,marge,"oh, dear.  i hope i wasn't too rough on him."
28954,lisa,"somebody had to tell him, mom.  in the long run, it's much"
28955,bart,[interrupts his sister by clearing his throat.  the camera
28956,homer,"all week, my lifelong dream was to be the next thomas edison."
28957,marge,what happened?  you didn't fall.
28958,homer,"oh, that.  i stuck a couple extra legs on there, 'cause i"
28959,lisa,"they're on hinges.  that's really ingenious, dad!"
28961,homer,really?  you think it's a good idea?
28962,bart,"oh, yeah!  safety sells!  especially to lame-os."
28965,homer,"look, mr. edison, i did it!  i'm an inventor!  and i owe it"
28967,bart," hey, dad, i heard you swearing.  mind if"
28968,homer,"i thought i had a great idea, but i must've seen it on this"
28969,bart,"if edison thought of that chair, how come it's not on this"
28970,homer,it's not?  maybe he never told anyone about it!  that chair
28972,homer,"so, we've got to go to the edison museum and smash it.  then"
28973,bart,but i thought you loved edison.
28977,homer,out of the way!  this is one invention you're not getting
28978,bart,"your electric hammer, maestro?"
28979,homer,"invent your way out of this, edison!"
28980,homer,"look, son ... edison was just like me."
28981,bart,you mean the wild mood swings?
28982,homer,no!  we both lived in another man's shadow.  this old-timey
28984,homer,"no, but we'll stop off at the da vinci museum on the way"
28985,bart,"uh, i think that's in italy, dad."
28986,homer,"oh.  well, then we'll take it out on eli whitney."
28992,lisa,"dad, those should be your millions!"
28993,bart,"i gotta admit, homer, you're taking this pretty well."
28994,homer,let's just say i'm sitting in the right chair.
28995,homer,"mail call!  gather 'round, everyone!  all right, one for ..."
28998,bart,one stinkin' letter?  why'd you make us gather 'round like
28999,homer,i needed my power fix.  
29000,marge,"hey, listen to this!    congratulations, your"
29002,marge,"please submit their names, along with ninety-five dollars,"
29003,lisa,"mom, they put every kid in america in that book, just so"
29005,marge,are you sure?  i can usually smell a scam from two towns
29006,bart,"yeah, lis', she is a smart, sophisticated woman.  [winks at"
29007,homer,"yeah, quit stalling, marge, we want our reward."
29008,homer,"look at me, bart!  i'm driving!"
29009,bart,"we're all proud of you, dad."
29011,marge,slow and steady wins the race!
29012,homer,stand back and watch the pro.
29013,lisa,"uh, shouldn't you put on a batting helmet?"
29014,homer,"nah, they mess up my hair."
29015,lisa,"hang in there, dad, just half a basket left!"
29016,bart,"wow, you sure get a lot of balls for a quarter."
29017,bart,"okay, what can i get for twelve, count 'em, twelve"
29022,bart,"whoa, can i try that sometime?"
29024,bart,"wow, thanks, nelson, i'll come by your house later!"
29025,marge,"oh, no you won't!  you stay away from nelson muntz."
29027,marge,"nelson's a troubled, lonely, sad little boy.  he needs to be"
29031,lisa,so what prize did you end up getting?
29032,bart,moustache comb.  what'd you get?
29033,lisa,fake moustache.  wanna comb it?
29034,bart,"oh, this sucks.  time to punch out of this yawn factory.  i'm"
29036,bart,"she doesn't scare me.  i do what i want, when i want."
29037,bart,won't you get in trouble if your mom sees you doing that?
29044,bart,are you crazy?  i don't want to shoot a stupid bird.
29054,bart,"but, but, i wasn't ... i didn't ..."
29057,homer,"i rolled up all the socks, "
29058,marge," while i deal with this, why don't you"
29059,homer,"all right ... oh, i hate folding sheets.  [holds up a"
29061,homer,"well, whatever it is, it's a two man job.  where's bart?"
29062,marge,he's up in his room.    bart!
29063,homer,"it's okay, marge, i'll get him.    bart!!"
29064,lisa, what the heck's going on?
29065,marge,we need bart to help fold your father's underpants.  where
29066,lisa,bart?  aw ... he went to play with a friend?
29067,marge,"he didn't go to nelson's, did he?"
29068,lisa,"no, no ... i'm pretty sure he's with milhouse."
29071,homer,tell bart to come home!!
29074,marge,nelson?!  i explicitly forbade bart from playing with that
29081,bart,"yes, sir.  because i killed an innocent bird."
29087,marge,"young man, you're coming home with me this minute."
29091,marge,"""killer""?  why did he call you ""killer""?"
29092,bart,"mom, you were right.  nelson is bad news.  can we go home?"
29093,marge,what are you hiding there?
29095,marge,what are those cats doing behind you?
29096,bart,uh ... cats like me?    get ... get off!
29097,marge,bart!  did you kill that poor bird?
29098,bart,"i didn't mean to, mom.  the gun pulled to the left."
29099,marge,"you disobeyed me, snuck over here, and murdered a helpless"
29100,bart,"i know, i really screwed up.  i deserve to be punished."
29101,marge,"what's the point, bart?  i punish, and i punish, and i"
29110,marge,what do you think he's doing up there?
29111,homer,i don't know.  drug lab?
29113,homer,"or reading comic books, what am i, kreskin?  you tell me what"
29114,marge,"i don't know, and i don't want to know.  and i'm going to"
29115,bart,"oh, no!  i've got to keep these warm."
29116,marge," bart, stop whatever you're doing"
29117,bart,can't right now!  come back later.
29118,marge,"oh, i'll come back later.    how's this for"
29120,marge,why are you sitting like that?  what are you hiding this
29121,bart,that bird i killed was their mother.  i don't want her babies
29122,homer,why's it taking so long?  bart was born in about five
29123,marge,"actually, it took fifty-three hours."
29124,homer,"really?  well, the time just flew by, didn't it?"
29131,bart,"man, those are some funky-looking birds."
29132,homer," aw, you look like a little tiny dinosaur.  [gets"
29133,lisa,"dad, they aren't birds."
29134,bart,sure they are.  they came from eggs in a bird's nest.
29135,lisa,"one, they don't have beaks.  two, they don't have feathers,"
29137,homer,enough bickering!  i know how to settle this.
29139,homer," aww ... if anybody wants me, i'll be eating"
29148,bart,"no, don't hurt them!  i'll just keep them as pets."
29151,marge,i'm sure we can work this out.    he's just a
29153,marge,"bart, i'm sorry, but there's nothing we can do.  your lizards"
29154,bart,"everyone thinks they're monsters.  but i raised them, and i"
29155,marge,mmm ... not as hard as you think.
29161,marge,"sorry, i didn't realize i was in the way!"
29167,bart,"hey!  whoa, look at them!  go chirpy boy!  go bart junior!"
29169,lisa,"wow, did you know they had those webbed flaps for gliding?"
29172,lisa,but isn't that a bit short-sighted?  what happens when we're
29174,lisa,but aren't the snakes even worse?
29176,lisa,but then we're stuck with gorillas!
29178,homer,i'm proud of you boy.    mmm ... loganberry.
29179,lisa,"i don't get it, bart.  you got all upset when you killed one"
29180,bart,"hey, you're right ... i call the front seat!"
29181,lisa,you had it on the way over!
29200,homer,the chair?  ohh ... how come they only do crucifixions
29211,homer, you sent me to the chair.
29213,homer,"i know you are, but what am i?"
29216,marge,that's horrible!  who'll run the kwik-e-mart?
29220,bart,"oh, my god.  everyone snake swore revenge on is being"
29221,marge,it's almost as if he's killing from beyond the grave.
29222,lisa,i told you capital punishment isn't a deterrent.
29223,bart,"don't you get it?  he swore to kill me, too -- i'm next!"
29224,homer," don't worry, i'll protect"
29225,bart,  help!  dad's trying to kill me!
29226,homer,"it's hammer time, snitchy.  [swing and a miss, this time"
29228,lisa,of course -- the transplant!  somehow snake's hair must be
29229,marge," oh, please, lis, everyone's already figured that"
29230,bart,"you've got to fight the hair, dad."
29231,homer,but i look so youthful and hunky.
29234,marge,"may i remind you that two people are dead and ... oh, wait, i"
29238,marge,"sorry, but if i let you watch some of these gruesome"
29239,marge,"oh, homer you're not going as a hobo again?"
29241,lisa,"oh, bart, that's plutonium.  it's highly unstable!"
29243,bart,"hey lis, we're characters in a cartoon!"
29249,bart,a cartoon axe.  i love it.
29258,lisa,"dad, you've got to get us out of here!  use the remote!"
29259,homer,"huh?  oh, okay.  let's see ..."
29264,marge,"aw, somebody's in love.    that means"
29267,bart,what's wrong with stinky?
29268,marge,"she's teething.  look, her very first baby tooth!"
29271,homer, i just lost my appetite.
29274,marge,"homer, do something!  the ceiling's not a safe place for a"
29275,homer,"eh, all right, i got it.  [gets a broom and tries to poke"
29276,marge,"it's probably nothing, but we just wanted to be sure."
29278,homer,"is there anything you can prescribe, doctor?"
29280,marge,"oh, that's your cure for everything."
29288,marge,"oh, lord.  i was hoping this day would never come."
29289,homer,huh?  what are you talking about?
29291,marge,"oh, i guess i've been in denial.  homer, kang is maggie's"
29292,homer,  you intergalactic hussy!  how could you!  [covers
29295,marge,i absolutely refuse to go along with this;  but since
29298,marge,"  i tried to resist, but they applied powerful"
29300,marge,really?  that seemed awfully quick.
29306,homer,"it made me angry, jerry.  angry and tired."
29318,marge,i can't believe it.  jerry springer didn't solve our
29322,marge," oh, you couldn't destroy *every* politician."

29568,homer,"well, there were script problems from day one."
29569,bart,didn't seem like anybody even read the script.
29570,homer,"that was the problem.  the important thing is, after all"

29572,homer,"i didn't choose to be a gifted actor, marge.  it chose me!"
29575,lisa,"hey, dad, it says they need your full name.  you only put"

29585,homer,"yeah, but they were all part of a single ball of lies.  the"

29617,marge,homer!  excuse yourself!
29618,homer,"no way, narc!  bodily functions are a natural thing."
29619,bart,no to mention hilarious.  [makes farting noises with his
29620,marge,"you know, i really don't appreciate being called a narc.  and"
29621,homer, why do you have to turn everything into one big

30184,homer,"well, it's a ... hey!  i thought you twisted your ankle!"
30192,marge,"homer, i don't think you were listening to what he just ..."
30205,homer, the pig is in the poke.
30206,marge,"you know, i really don't care for that code-name."
30208,marge,"i know you're excited about starting a new job, but could you"
30209,homer," hold it, what's your clearance?"
30210,bart,we just wanna get a snack.
30213,marge,"homer, i don't want you using your new sleeper hold on the"
30214,homer,they'll be fine in half an hour.
30215,marge,"mmph, that's not the point.  and another thing, i asked you"
30216,homer,"it's a real honor to be guarding your body, sir."
30226,homer,"and after moe's, we went to krusty burger, and the mayor got"
30227,bart,"dad, don't you see what's going on?"
30228,lisa,that change was a bribe!
30229,homer,"oh, honey, don't be so naive.  that's how the world works!"
30230,lisa,no he doesn't!  trains are regulated by the federal
30236,homer,"so, how'd you get the nickname ""legs""?"
30241,bart,"hey, my milk!  i traded my math book for that."
30242,lisa,"dad, what a nice surprise!  [attempts to kiss her father"
30243,homer,  get that away from me!
30248,homer,you monster!  how could you do that to the children?
30250,homer,and to think i respected you!  and defended you!  you
30252,homer, his corpse is climbing the building!
30254,homer,  wait a second.  i'm not saving you
30256,homer,"you're forgetting, you've got the best bodyguard in the"
30259,homer,"relax, you're in good hands.  now come on, i'll pull you up."
30269,homer,"oooh!  the mafia guy's all mad!  oh, what are you gonna do,"
30274,bart,"aren't you scared, dad?  i mean, if i were fat tony, and god"
30275,homer,"oh, don't worry about that, boy.  he's already out on bail."
30276,marge,you're guarding the mayor tonight?  after fat tony swore
30277,homer,"it's my duty, marge.  besides, those mobsters don't scare me."
30279,homer,what?  there's nothing to worry about!
30280,bart,"well, then you start it!"
30281,homer,"all right, fine, i'll take a cab."
30283,homer,"oh, i get it, you're worried about those mobsters, aren't"
30285,homer,"you've got to snap out of this funk, mayor.  i'm gonna take"
30288,homer,do you have a table for the mayor?
30290,homer,why do you talk that way?
30292,homer,"all right, fat tony, if it's trouble with quimby you're"
30294,homer,mayor?  fat tony asked me to give you this.  
30296,homer,oh no!  wait.  maybe i didn't do it right!
30311,homer,"that guy with the knife sure can dance, huh?"
30313,homer,"i think i saw him in ""rent"", or ""stomp"", or ""clomp"", or some"
30320,homer,yes!  nobody messes with the mayor when homer simpson's on
30324,homer,"actually, you were luminous, magnetic ... "
30326,homer,really?  would you say i was magnetic?
30336,marge,remember how excited we were when this place opened?  then a
30337,lisa,i'm surprised they bothered to move it when they moved the
30338,homer,"oh, i can explain that.  you see ..."
30340,bart,all right!  here comes the implosion!
30342,lisa,"dad, we hit don rickles!"
30344,marge,we'd better stop and get the car washed.
30345,homer,"eh, what's the rush.  it might rain next week."
30347,homer,really?  think i should get it washed?
30349,marge,"you listen to your friends, but you never listen to me."
30353,marge,"wow, you can't find this stuff anywhere.  seals and crofts,"
30354,lisa,"i've never heard of these bands, mom, what kind of music do"
30359,homer,"ten dollars?  what is this, a car wash for millionaires?"
30360,bart,"throw hot wax on him, dad."
30363,homer,hey!  how did churchy la femme get half price?
30365,homer,"pfft.  senior citizen?  flanders?  well, we'll see about"
30367,homer,"i wouldn't do that, reverend.  you see, ""saint flanders"" is"
30369,homer,"did you, or did you not use a senior citizens' discount card"
30371,homer,"now i'm not a fancy big city lawyer,  but"
30382,marge,"you mean you've never splurged and say, eaten an entire"
30384,bart, you've never snuck out of church to
30386,homer,"geez, flanders, you're sixty years old and you haven't lived"
30400,homer,"you got that right.  throw on the mesquite, bart!"
30403,homer,"well, well, well, so flawless flanders needs help from stinky-"

30447,homer,"yeah, yeah, yeah, i'll figure it out.  this isn't rocket"
30451,homer," hey, flanders, don't spill my beer!"
30454,homer,okey-dokey.  let's hit the tables.
30456,homer,"ooh, i think someone just had his first taste of bloodlust!"

30505,homer,"ladies, we wanna do the honorable thing, so breakfast is on"
30509,homer,"but ginger, honey, i am not the catch i appear to be."

30519,homer,"ow!  that sting hurts so much!  we gotta get out of this,"
30521,homer,"blame me if you must, but don't ever speak ill of the"

30545,homer,would you rather tell maude the truth?
30547,homer,"well, i only saw them from the back 'cause they were so busy"
30550,homer,stupid isotopes.  hurry up and lose so we can get outta
30551,lisa,"why do you hate the isotopes so much, dad?"

30556,marge,"that's right!  like my mother always said, you've got to"
30558,homer, i'm gonna warm up the car.
30559,marge,but there's only been one pitch!
30564,lisa," is he, mom?  you can tell me."
30570,homer,"heh, heh, heh, heh, losers."
30571,marge,"but only by two points, and they didn't resort to stealing"
30572,lisa,"with a little middle relief, they might even make the"
30573,homer,"you'll be in your cold, cold grave before that ever"
30574,marge,"homer, would you please stop talking about the childrens'"
30575,homer,what's the hub-bub?  did moe finally blow his brains

30609,marge,sure you do.  you have the right to remain silent!
30610,homer,"that was cold blooded, marge."
30612,lisa,but it's not fair.  adults always blame kids for
30613,homer,"well if kids are so innocent, why is everything bad named"
30615,homer,"not until you're older, son."
30618,lisa," what a beautiful night.  fireflies, full moon ..."

30643,bart,"milhouse, do you see what's on channel six?"
30647,bart,"milhouse, spread the word.  we're seeing this movie ..."
30676,bart,"oh, that is it!  i'm tired of being pushed around by"
30678,lisa,wait!  we don't need supernatural powers.  we already know
30679,bart,she's right!  homer's done a ton of crap that never made
30682,lisa, great!  this is all gold.
30684,bart,no!  we have to reach people whose opinions actually
30685,homer,"so, marge, ready for another episode of ""don't go"
30686,marge,i'm tired of that show.  but i've been hearing

30710,homer,"oh, i hope they don't reveal that this is a comb-over!"
30719,lisa,and guess who's been practicing medicine without a

30725,homer,"bart, get down here!  i'm gonna spank you back to the"
30726,bart,you can't make us come down.

30821,homer,"no!  wait!  this is all my fault!  oh, if i could only"
30825,homer, stem lube!  even i didn't fall for that.
30827,homer,"hey, i know you!  we were in the same pyramid scheme."
30829,homer,"yeah, i'm getting tired of them pointing and laughing at"

30870,marge, it's so nice to have a peaceful weekend together.
30872,marge,"mm-hmm.  hey, why don't we do one of those craft kits aunt"
30873,marge,ooh!  how about paint-by-numbers?
30874,lisa,it's so rigid and uncreative.
30875,marge,"okay ... oh, leathercraft!"
30876,lisa,"oh, those poor, helpless cows."
30877,marge,mmm ... what about clay?  you got any problem with clay?
30878,lisa,"hey, what's this?  ""vincent price's"
30879,marge,"well, what are we waiting for?"

30966,homer,you guys are following me?  i was following flanders!
30968,homer,"hit the road, gramps.  this is a private sky-box."
30991,homer,but this might be my last chance to win one.
30993,homer,"wally, i'd be lying if i said i hadn't."
31020,homer,"oh, i can't wait.  look, marge, i got a scorecard printed up"
31021,lisa,isn't mid-season just a dumping ground for second-rate shows
31022,homer,you're thinking of all the other years.  this year's shows
31026,marge,it's hard to believe someone that young could have risen
31031,homer,isn't bad?  tell me one thing mankind has ever done mankind's
31039,homer, he's named like my name!!
31042,homer,wow.  they captured my personality perfectly!  did you see
31043,lisa,"that's not really you, dad, he's just a fictional character"
31044,homer," don't confuse daddy, lisa."
31045,marge,"homer, it's just a coincidence.  like that guy named anthony"
31047,marge,mmm ... another person wants to congratulate you for having a
31048,homer," hello?  yes, this is the original homer"
31050,homer,"marge, that was debbie pinson!  deb-bie pin-son!!"
31054,homer," ""local man has same name"" ... a tv character has"
31056,homer, and that's the end of that
31059,homer,"all right, what's the name?"
31065,homer,take it or leave it ...  carl.
31073,homer,"hey, what's going on?  that guy's not homer simpson!  he's"
31075,homer,"no, no, he can't be!  i know, maybe he's just acting stupid"
31080,homer,"shut up!  i'm not your clown!  don't diminish me!  gentlemen,"
31084,homer,i don't understand what happened.  why did they change homer
31085,lisa,"the first episode was just a pilot, dad.  producers fiddle"
31086,marge,"your character provides the comic relief!  like, oh ..."
31087,homer,wish i hadn't bought a hundred of these.
31089,homer,"well, i'm sorry to disappoint you gentlemen, but you seem to"
31092,homer,"people are laughing at me, marge.  let's get outta here!"
31093,marge,but her forehead's on fire!
31094,homer,fine.  i'll be in the car.  driving home.
31097,homer," uh, oh, spaghetti-o's."
31102,homer,"come on, people!  enough is enough!"
31106,homer,the whole town's laughing at me.  even that cat out there!
31108,homer,and that big yellow flower!
31109,marge," homer, your growing insanity is starting to"
31110,homer,"hmm ... i guess i could.  but while i'm gone, keep an eye on"
31113,homer,"uh ... so, i just wanna know how come you made your"
31128,homer,"yeah, but why does the homer simpson character have to"
31130,homer,i'm begging you!  i'm a human being!  let me have my
31131,homer,"your honor?  i'd like to sue the producers of ""police cops"""
31133,homer, then i'd like to legally change my name!
31135,homer,any of these will be fine.
31140,marge,you changed your name without consulting me?
31141,homer,"that's the way max power is, marge.  decisive."
31143,marge,but this will be so confusing!  the mailman won't know what
31145,marge,and what about the tattoo on my you-know-what?
31146,homer,"oh, honey, they have acids that can burn that off."

31228,homer,"oh, this is the worst party ever!"
31229,marge,i don't know.  remember that new year's eve at lenny's?  he

31231,marge,you can't blame them for having a social conscience.
31232,homer,sure you can.  bunch of no-good do-gooders.
31234,homer,"that's what i'm saying!  see marge, this guy gets it."
31240,homer,no.  i just thought it was cute when you called him ...

31296,homer,"i'm picking it up ... ""sala"" seems to mean ""jerk,"" and i"
31297,marge,"either put that book down, or let me drive."
31298,homer," hey, they stole our idea!  see, look!"
31301,homer," i cherish you, my precious."

31318,marge,"then the bird sang ""i love the night life"" with clever new"
31319,homer,"yeah, i hate that song."
31320,marge,"i do too, but it was sweet.    women really like"
31321,homer,"don't worry, honey.  i've got something really special"
31322,marge,"it's not that monkey card i found in the car, is it?"
31323,homer,wouldn't you like to know.
31337,homer,this valentine's crap has gone too far!
31343,homer,"and ask yourselves, people.  who's to blame for all"
31347,homer,"will you stop it?  it's easy to blame ourselves, but"
31348,homer,"c'mon, apu.  make your move."
31352,homer,"i dunno.  gasoline, acid, i got some stuff in the trunk."
31357,homer,"hey, look -- it's elton john!"

31412,homer,i saw krabapple's butt -- i paid.
31413,marge,whoopsie.  this could take a minute.
31414,lisa,"there's an opening, mom.  "

31416,bart,"mom, to your left, he's letting you in.  go!"
31419,marge,"no, no, as soon as i get over, that lane will stop moving."
31424,homer," wow, did you see that thing?  so powerful, so"
31426,homer,"hey, a red one.    can i buy that?"
31436,homer,"aw, crap, it's a girls' car!  i can't drive this."
31439,homer,shut up!  screw you guys!

31446,bart,"c'mon, mom, just cut across the field."
31447,marge,"oh, i don't know.  doesn't seem right."
31448,bart,do you want to spend your whole life doing what's right?
31450,homer,"marge, you've been out there all morning."
31452,homer,so?  lying on the couch and eating stuff isn't the same if

31488,marge,"i'd like to help you, chief, but my license was revoked."
31492,marge,"now if you'll excuse me, i have some dust that needs busting."

31527,lisa,"dad, don't you remember?  it's our special saturday."
31528,marge,you agreed to spend one saturday a month doing something
31530,bart,"oh, quit complaining.  it's half the work of a divorced"
31531,homer,"yeah, but it's twice as much as a deadbeat dad."
31534,bart,"hysterical, but i traded my turn to lisa for her dessert."
31535,homer,d'oh!  but we did a lisa thing last month -- [notices

31547,homer, we're going to go see marmaduke?
31548,lisa,"no, the smithsonian travel exhibit.  it encapsulates"
31549,homer,"what, and marmaduke doesn't."
31550,lisa,"no, dad, my mind is made up."
31551,homer, this is all your fault for trading away your

31567,homer,"you've gotta admit, marge, that's a lot more"
31569,lisa,ugh.  that antenna is an eyesore.
31570,homer,"just pretend it's a tree, honey.  or as we say at"

31612,lisa,rrgh!  i just want to study.
31615,homer,"no it's not.  [picks her up, causing her to mark up"
31617,homer," ooh, here's something you like.  ""when"

31679,bart,"yeah, well, it serves you right for eavesdropping."
31680,marge,"mmmm.  well, i guess we both learned a lesson.  but"
31687,lisa,"wow, i've been a cat, a tree, and cokie roberts.  it's"

31711,homer,"aw, you're just jealous because you don't have the belly"
31713,marge,"is it safe to eat that much food, dr. hibbert?"
31718,homer,"my hat's off to you, red.  you're a true american"
31721,homer,"he called me, ""greenhorn.""  i called him, ""tony"

31742,homer,great!  i'll write your mother and tell her the marriage
31745,marge,anyone?  anyone at all?
31746,lisa,"oh!  milhouse is selling seeds, and he's coming this"

31749,lisa,hey!  people are coming!  i think they're jehovah's
31753,marge,hmmm ... i would have feigned interest.

31755,lisa,"dad's got it on the speed-dial under ""fire."""
31756,marge,"this is it, honey.  we did it."
31760,marge,"no, but if you just ring the ..."
31761,homer,"uh, yeah.  i need something that will keep me awake,"
31765,homer,"no problem, i'll balance it out with a bottle of sleeping"
31766,homer,you'll never believe what just happened.  i fell

31782,bart,"dad, they're trying to kill us."
31783,homer,"oh, why do all my trips end like this?"
31784,homer,we'll get through that barrier somehow.  old blinky
31786,homer,"i'm not red, i'm homer."
31804,homer,"well son, i guess it's time to go home."
31805,bart,any thoughts on how we're going to get there?
31806,homer,"no, but i'm sure the good lord will provide."
31808,homer, thank you.  [picks up the cap and

31826,homer,"uh, good morning, lord.  i just have to, uh, compliment"
31828,homer,"no, *you're* too kind, and wise, and righteous.  i can't"
31830,marge,"well, some general-interest magazines would be nice."
31834,homer,"no problem, lord!  and it would be even easier to avoid"
31838,marge,but he said it was forbidden.
31840,marge,please stop eating that!  god's going to be furious.
31841,homer,you're pretty uptight for a naked chick.  you know what
31842,marge,"well, it is a sin to waste food."
31843,homer,and you keep saying we need to do things together.
31844,marge, mmm.  this could really spice up those pies
31849,homer,"uh, uh, uh, i think we should see other people?"
31851,homer,"yeah, just like yesterday."
31855,homer,"oh, my dear, sweet eve.  i love you even more than the"

31882,lisa,"it's a plague, you moron!  and we got lots more"
31885,lisa,"not now, moses, we've got to find a way out of here."
31887,lisa,eh.  slave labor -- you get what you pay for.
31888,lisa,"oh, we'll never be able to swim that far."
31891,lisa,"hey, cut that out!  i have an idea."
31894,lisa," hmm, well, actually it looks"
31896,lisa," uh-huh-hum, more or less -- hey, is that"

31951,homer,"but, marge, i'm not like other men; that's why you buy my pants at that"
31952,marge,i'm serious.  you never finished painting the garage...
31953,homer,"fine.  i'll drop everything i'm doing just for you, but you'll have to"
31957,homer,excuse me.  i have a few questions for pop.

31971,homer,"no, no!  i'm into chicken!"
31975,homer,"how about it, bart?  would you like a new backyard barbecue pit?"
31976,bart,can i burn evidence in it?
31977,homer,we can *all* burn evidence in it.
31978,homer,i'd like to return this barbecue kit.
31980,homer," well, if you'll follow"
31983,homer,"well, of course!  any kid would love to have this ... activity center."
31988,homer,i'll never get rid of it.  it'll follow me to the end of the earth!
31989,homer, shavin' my shoulders.  i'm gettin' it all shaved off.
31990,marge,"homie, someone's at the door.  they want to talk to you about some sort"
31991,homer,take the kids out back.  
31995,homer,"um ...  alright, just go ahead and sue me!  everybody else"
31997,homer,you mean this hunk o' junk?  this isn't art; it's the barbecue that
32000,marge, is everything okay?  [so do the
32001,homer,this lady says i'm an artist.
32004,homer, in high school i was voted most likely to *be* a mental
32006,homer,so you'd better catch the fever!   catch it!
32007,lisa,"dad, chew with your mouth closed.  you're losing your mystique."
32008,homer,"lisa, all great artists love free food.  check out jasper johns."
32010,marge,"i don't know.  i studied art for years, but i just don't get this."
32011,bart,sounds like somebody's jealous.
32012,marge,no i'm not!  i just can't believe some people are paying hundreds of
32018,homer,"whoo hoo!  look, marge, my first sale!  in your face, jasper johns!"
32019,lisa,"where are you going with that junk, dad?"
32020,homer,i'm gonna be an outsider artist.  that way i can turn all these old

32022,homer,"hey, i've always had an interest in art, dating back to my schoolgirl"
32023,marge,that's *my* life you're describing!
32024,homer,"i think i remember my own life, marge."
32025,homer,"astrid said the key to my art is anger, but you know me -- i'm mr."
32026,lisa,"well, if it'll help ... mom found out her engagement ring is made of"
32027,homer," good work, honey.  keep it"
32028,bart,"well, i'm flunking math, and the other day i was a little attracted to"
32029,homer,"moe, this is astrid, my dealer, and these are my fans"
32034,homer,"what do we owe you, moe?"
32039,marge,"here he is.  this is where the ""magic"" happens."
32043,homer,"wow!  it's like marge's dream come true ... for me!  isn't that great,"
32044,homer,"look, marge.  they're advertising my show in ""art in america"".  it's"
32045,marge,"i'm happy for you.  now, good night."
32046,homer,good night.   you're upset
32047,marge,"oh, homer, being an artist was *my* dream, but now, without even"
32048,homer,"oh, honey, i've always liked your art.  your paintings look like the"
32049,marge,"that's sweet, but how would you like it if i -- i don't know -- entered"
32050,homer,"frankly, i'd be a little turned on."
32052,homer,"marge, i've screwed up everything i've ever done.  i mean, look at"
32053,marge,"well, i guess nothing else matters as long as *you're* happy."
32054,homer,now you're makin' sense.  good night.  [turns off light and goes to
32056,homer,"i give you ""botched hibachi"".  the tricycle's on loan from the maggie"
32058,homer, what's going on here?  you weirdoes love this
32062,homer,"come back!  i'm a god to you!  worship me or fear my wrath!  oh,"
32063,homer,why don't people like my art anymore?
32064,marge,"homer, i know you worked hard, but all of your ... things were kind of"
32065,homer,"hey, ray jay johnson never changed his act, and he's more popular now"
32067,homer,"""you can call him ray, or you can call him jay, or you can call him ray"
32068,lisa,i'm sick of him already.
32069,marge,"the point is, great artists are always trying new things, like"
32070,marge,it's so exciting to do something cultural together.
32071,homer, matt groening?!  what's he
32073,marge,mmm!  a claes oldenberg!  he's a european who defied convention and
32074,homer, he must be a hundred feet tall.
32075,marge,"now, this is a joseph turner.  in an era when everyone else painted"
32076,homer,it's glorious!  the streets are paved with water!  you could ride a
32077,marge,"and picasso started out painting realistically, then moved on to"
32080,homer,"no, these guys are geniuses.  i could never think of something like"
32081,lisa,"well, dad, if the museum didn't inspire you, maybe you should do"
32082,homer,is he that jerk that revealed the magicians' secrets?
32083,lisa,"no, christo is a conceptual artist who does huge outdoor projects.  he"
32085,lisa,"oh, yes, and he also set up hundreds of yellow umbrellas along the"
32087,lisa,"to make the world a more magical place, i guess.   although they"
32088,homer,killer umbrellas!  of course!  exquisite.
32089,lisa,"no, dad, no, my point is you have to do something big and daring!"
32090,homer,"big?  daring?  lisa, that's it!  i've got an idea for a wonderful art"
32092,bart,"hit the road, ""welcome home""!"
32093,homer,"adiós, ""casa de flanders""!"
32094,bart,"see you in hell, ""god bless this house""!"
32095,homer,"so long, ""the simpsons""!  ...d'oh!"
32096,bart,are you sure this is art and not vandalism?
32097,homer,"that's for the courts to decide, son."
32098,homer," people of springfield, behold my latest work!"
32099,marge,"homer, what have you done?!"
32100,homer,"it's conceptual art.  ""the grand canals of springfield"", just like"
32101,marge,i think some people are going to be upset.
32104,marge,"well, they're in the business.  real people might not be so"
32111,marge,"well, homer, i have to admit, you created something people really love."
32112,homer,"no, i'm just a nut who couldn't build a barbecue.  you'll always be the"
32114,homer,and is that us on the roof?
32117,marge,"oh, i don't know.  could be.  i need some inspiration.  "
32122,marge,"and it's all because of your letter, lisa."
32123,lisa,"well, actually, i just wrote it for a school"
32125,homer,a mascot contest!  i'm sure to win that -- unless
32126,marge,"no one's gonna jinx you homer.  in fact, we're"
32127,bart,"yeah, go for the gold dad!"
32128,homer,"shut up, shut up, shut up!  "
32129,homer,"knowing you always hate my first idea, i prepared a"
32130,bart,"those aren't the dog's eyes, are they?"
32133,homer,"it's fun for the whole family, and the ends are razor"
32137,homer," they picked springy!  in your face, patty and"
32146,homer,i've never wanted a beer worse in my life.
32148,marge,"are you talking to me, or the beer?"
32149,homer,"to you, my bubbly long-neck beechwood aged lover."
32153,bart,"thank you, thank you.   so,"
32158,homer, he says what we're all thinking.
32162,bart,now i'd like to say one last thing to our olympics
32164,bart,"hey, chalmers, where are you from?"
32175,bart,what are you gonna do to me?
32177,bart," the fireworks, candy, and puppy dog store?"
32181,bart,"oh, no, lis, they've got you too?"
32182,lisa,got me?  what are you talking about?  i've been
32192,bart,that's the prize?  a banana?

32195,lisa,we tried giving them eggnog at christmas but it led
32198,bart,you tell them when to sleep?
32199,lisa,shh!  don't wake them. [the nurse and lisa start

32202,bart,cool! [alternatively pressing the vacuum to grampa's
32204,marge,"so, bart, how was your first day of forced volunteerism?"
32205,bart,that place sucks!  the nurses don't let grandpa do
32206,homer, lucky stiff; i'm working my

32259,homer,of course not!  [continues singing.  the toilet flushes
32260,lisa,"bart, are you crazy?  we've got to get the old folks"
32261,bart,"no way, lis, they're finally having some fun."
32263,lisa,"hey, maybe you're right.  they don't even seem to"
32265,bart,but i set you free!  no more nap time.  no more
32269,bart,"oh, it's not fair.  i'm not supposed to die now."
32279,lisa,what the heck's going on?
32282,bart,"well, i finished my community service."

32295,marge,i don't know how you can all just lay around the house on a nice day
32296,homer,we stopped those when the kids said i was too fat to carry.
32297,marge,"oh, come on!  let's go for a walk.  this family is getting so lazy."
32298,bart,"i'm not lazy, i'm just ... um ... uh ... lisa, finish my sentence for"

32303,homer,"can we, marge?  can we get a horse?"
32305,homer,there's some dogs.  we could all ride dogs.
32306,marge,"forget it, homer.  no one's riding any--"
32307,bart," heigh-oh, silver, away!"
32308,marge,"oh, look!  there's the store where i buy my yarn!  ...but you don't"

32311,bart," if you love me, you'll kill me."
32312,marge,"looks like something exciting's happening.  well, we'll have to read"
32313,lisa,why can't we see it now?
32314,marge,"well, it's not really on our walking route."
32315,marge,this is so much nicer than the kwik-e-mart!
32317,bart,"hey, dad, gimme 50 bucks.  i gotta buy some things.  uh, better make it"
32319,marge,"homer, don't you think you're spoiling--"

32636,homer,"sure, by *their* standards, but we live in america.  [opens the can and"
32637,lisa,this also says it can cause red tide poisoning.
32639,marge,"homer, you could've just unscrewed the bottom."
32640,homer,"a little late for could'ves, marge."
32641,lisa, i don't think there's enough here for a vacation.
32642,marge,there is for a *mega savings* vacation.   chuck

32679,lisa,don't you serve anything that's even remotely japanese?
32681,homer," oh, they got our number!"
32682,marge,"oh, my goodness!  homer, those are $150!"
32683,homer,it's worth every cent.  i'm tired of fumbling with round fruit.
32684,marge,maybe we should just head back to the hotel.
32685,lisa,but you promised me we'd do something japanese!
32686,homer,"oh, of course, you're right!  you know, i read about a shinto tea house"
32687,homer,"mmm, fifty-dollar pretzel.  hey, what's baby huey doing?"
32688,bart, it says here they throw salt
32693,homer,thank god.  i couldn't take another minute in this hellhole.
32694,lisa,*now* can we do something japanese?
32695,homer,"oh, i'm sick of doing japanese stuff!  in jail we had to be in this"
32696,bart,"then we had to do two hours of origami, followed by flower arranging"
32697,homer,"[to bart in japanese, subtitled"
32701,lisa,"oh, it's beautiful, dad!"
32702,homer,it's a crane.  the japanese believe they bring good luck.  [hands the
32703,marge,be careful.  we need that money to get home.
32706,marge,"but, mr. ambassador, how are we going to get home?"
32709,bart,and i think i've finally found what i was put on this earth to do --
32711,bart," knife goes in, guts come out."
32712,lisa,yippee!  time for the company loyalty song!
32714,homer,"well, this sucks; what else is on?  "
32717,marge,"""family wish show"" ... hmm, that gives me an idea."
32718,lisa,i think we all had that idea.
32719,homer,i didn't.  what is it?  lunch?
32721,homer,"well, i haven't talked it over with the family, but i think we'd all"
32722,marge," no, no, no!  we want plane tickets home to"
32725,marge,"we'll go with ""ow, that hurts!"", skip."
32730,marge,i'm afraid this might be the end.
32731,homer,"well, at least we'll die doing what we love"
32735,homer,"before i go i want to say something.  game shows aren't about cruelty,"
32737,homer," i love this show.  take that, you stupid hosers!"
32738,lisa,i'm proud of you dad!  buying an electric car will help clean
32739,homer,but i like the nice things you said about me.
32742,marge,"bart!    well, that shut me up."
32743,marge,"boy, that quiet engine sure makes conversation a lot easier."
32744,homer,"yeah, it's got a lot of other problems, too."
32745,lisa,"look, dad, you're heading for the harbor!"
32746,homer,"relax, we're in an electric car."
32747,homer,"uh, i'm sorry, but the car did not meet my eco-concerns."
32750,marge,"hey, we never opened that envelope to see what our gift is."
32751,homer,we didn't?  that's odd.  seems like we would've done that
32753,homer,"  well, here it is, so we can open it and"
32756,marge,they're passes to a test screening of a new movie starring
32758,marge,who cares?  mel gibson!
32759,homer,"mel gibson is just a guy marge, no different than me or"
32760,marge,were you or lenny ever named sexiest man alive?
32761,homer,"hmmm, i'm not certain about lenny ..."
32762,marge,"besides, it's not just his chiseled good looks.  ""people"""
32764,marge,"of course, homey.  aren't you thinking about me?"
32782,marge,it's not boring.  he's passionate about government.
32783,homer,at least the jimmy stewart version had the giant rabbit who
32784,homer,"well, that was a stinker."
32785,marge,i liked it.  it was nice to see a movie where people solved
32786,homer,"oh, you're just saying that because your boyfriend was in it."
32787,marge,will you stop acting so jealous?
32792,marge,"um, will you be reading the cards yourself, mel?"
32798,homer,  waste my time in front
32803,homer,"and i've been looking for you too, pal."
32806,bart,quiet!  dad's going to get his butt kicked by mel
32807,homer,"listen, gibson.  i'm tired of hollywood pretty-boys like"
32811,homer,"really?  you want my help?  marge, did you hear that?"
32812,lisa,"dad, i thought you hated ..."
32814,marge,homer doesn't know anything about making movies.
32816,homer,"she's always doing that, mel."
32819,homer,"hee, hee.  guilty as charged."
32825,homer,"you had me at, ""hello."""
32827,marge,"hollywood, here we come!"
32829,marge,"look, they're making a movie!  robert downey, jr. is shooting"
32830,bart,i don't see any cameras.
32839,homer,they will if you set up that the dog is evil.  all you do is
32841,homer,"uh, uh, uh.  now here's your biggest problem of all."
32843,homer,and it was fine for the 1930s; the country was doing great
32845,homer,"oh, mel, it's the most boring piece of garbage i've ever"
32847,homer,piece of cake.  now where's that kid with my latte?
32852,homer,  i second that motion.  [holds up a
32858,homer,it was symbolism.  he was mad.
32860,homer,ugh.  those movies sucked.  i only saw them to get marge
32866,homer,do the words executive producer mean anything to you?
32886,homer,"aw, crap!  here they come."
32888,bart,"wow, these dummies look pretty good."
32891,marge,"homer, what are you doing here?"
32892,homer,no time talk -- need steal car.  must save powerful but
32894,homer,movies aren't stupid.  they fill us with romance and hatred
32896,homer,"before ""lethal weapon 2"" i didn't know there could be a bomb"
32899,homer,they're my only escape from the drudgery of work and family.
32906,homer,"it was your plan, from ""braveheart.""  your army mooned the"
32908,homer,"actually, i didn't see it, but on the poster it --"
32910,homer,"i think so.  [walks a few steps, dragging the car along with"
32911,homer,"aw, i'm sorry i ruined your career, mel."
32913,homer,"how did the country lose its way, mel?  when did we stop"
32915,homer,"well, whatever it is, we gotta get rolling on our next"
32917,homer," okay, mr. difficult.  how about a teen sex"
32918,lisa,"principal skinner, what would you say is the most important"
32922,bart,"  sure is.  hey, what's that?  [picks up some"
32932,bart,help!  help!  fire ... helmets.  
32934,bart,"sure, i can do something destructive.  "
32952,homer,thank you for getting me out of work.
32957,homer,"yeah, he's something else, all right."
32959,homer,"  hey, that looks like bart."
32961,marge,  put it away!  put it away!
32963,marge,you mean like john leguizamo?
32965,homer,"  hi marge, it's me, homer."
32969,marge,"a drug?  i know bart can be rambunctious, but he's not some"
32970,bart,"gimme an ""f!""  gimme an ""art!"""
32972,homer,i'd say he's coming out of the pep closet.  
32973,marge,i don't want to pump my little boy full of drugs.
32977,marge,that's amazing -- and darling.
32979,homer,they've become your slaves.
32983,bart,i don't want to take drugs.
32984,homer,sure you do.  all your favorite stars abuse drugs.  brett
32988,homer,"yeah, and i'm a size four."
32989,homer,"bart, let's just forget all about that drug thing.  why don't"
32991,homer,just take one bite.  if you're not 100% different [bart drops
32995,marge,"honey?  if you don't want to take the medicine, we won't"
32997,marge,"no, i just thought you might love me enough to let me help"
32998,bart,"mom ... all right, i'll do it for you.  "
32999,homer,"way to guilt him, marge."
33001,marge,"good morning, honey.    how is my special little"
33002,bart,i'm having side effects from the dope.
33003,marge,it's not dope!  it's something to help you concentrate.
33004,bart,all i know is my testicles won't fit in my underwear.
33005,marge,"bart, get those oranges out of there."
33018,bart,well it's not like i've never seen a dog before.
33020,bart,"  come on, people, this poetry isn't going to"
33026,lisa,no way.    the seven habits of highly
33027,bart,"joke if you will, but did you know most people use 10% of"
33028,lisa,are you standing up to get me to leave?
33030,lisa,"  hey, i'm not a time burglar."
33032,lisa,"all right, i'll go.  you don't have to be a jerk about it."
33035,marge,"hmmm.    ""thank you in advance"
33036,bart,"cost of paper, five cents.  a mother's love, priceless."
33039,bart,"no, but here's a book called ""chicken soup for the loser"""
33040,homer,"hmmm, my career has kind of lost momentum."
33041,bart,"i think it's the bright blue pants.  i mean, you're not on a"
33042,homer,"well, i have been thinking about making them into cutoffs."
33043,homer,"i tell you, the kid's a wonder.  he organized all the"
33045,homer,"you know it.  plus, he gave me this appointment dealy."
33047,homer,"ah, this thing will do anything.  watch, i'll ask it how"
33049,homer,and look at this -- [pulls out a grater from the side of
33052,homer,"oh, if you want one, they sell 'em at --"
33054,homer,"he's gone from goofus to gallant, and we owe it all to mind-"
33055,marge,bart's so well-behaved now.  maybe you and i can have a night
33056,homer,ooh!  let's go to the water park!  the ten-year ban ended
33057,marge,i was thinking of something a little more ... adult.
33059,marge,and then afterwards ... 
33060,homer,  really?  with butterscotch on it?
33061,marge,i think you misheard me.
33062,lisa,i'm so glad you're here.  bart's really acting funny.
33063,homer,"ray jay funny, or o. j. funny?"
33064,bart,you're probably wondering about the coat hangers.  they're to
33066,bart,it can read your electric organizer from space.
33067,homer,"even mine?    hey, i had"
33070,bart,who else?  major league baseball.
33071,homer,"  marge, i think bart's gone crazy."
33072,lisa,"oh, bart, what's happened to you?"
33073,bart,"nothing yet, but the time draws near.  [whips out a pair of"
33074,homer,"  hey, you found my needle-nose pliers."
33075,marge,"i understand the electrodes, but why does he have to be on"
33081,homer,he quit blinking.  he says that's when they kill you.
33084,marge,i think we should take him off the drug.
33089,marge,stop him!  he's whacked out of his gourd.
33092,homer,"hey, there was just air in mine.  [clutches chest and"
33101,marge,"mmmm, my sweet baby.  he must feel so helpless and scared."
33102,bart, don't stop thinking about tomorrow
33109,homer,"my god, is she brave, standing up to that freaked-out junkie."
33110,lisa,"dad, that junkie is your son."
33111,homer,why don't you just tell everybody?
33112,bart,"hey, mom.  thanks for coming out."
33113,marge,"oh, thank you for stopping the tank."
33117,marge,"how about getting out of the tank, eh?  maybe stopping your"
33120,bart,right after i blow up one thing.  
33126,homer,the frame store!  you monster!
33134,bart,i told you they were monitoring my activities.
33144,lisa," it's good to have the old bart back.  plus, he's"
33145,marge,"oh, bart, i'm so sorry we sent you on that psychotropic"
33146,bart,at least i got to see some cool colors.
33147,homer,and mark mcgwire gave you an autographed bat.
33148,lisa,why is the zero made of glass?
33149,homer,who cares?  that man can really slug.
33150,marge,"well, i'm not going to give my baby any more dangerous drugs."
33155,bart,come to think of it i haven't seen uter since the last
33159,homer,"here we are, kids.  the zoo."
33163,homer,"if he's so smart, how come he's dead?"
33168,bart,"check it out dad, you can print out the headline from the"
33169,homer,"ooh, pointless nostalgia!"
33170,homer,"hey, i smell cake!  cake that says  farewell"
33172,bart,"oh, that's nothing.  he can hear pudding."
33177,homer,i'll have you know i wandered off from the tour.
33179,homer,"oh, i like food alright ..."
33185,homer,"no, it usually takes a few hours."
33187,homer,thanks for the chance.  you won't never regret this mr.
33188,marge,"you know homey, the ""e"" doesn't work on that typewriter."
33189,homer,"we don't need no stinkin' ""e""."
33192,homer,"well, what do you think?"
33196,homer,"oh, it's so hard to get to 500 words."
33197,homer,"ok, what restaurant did we review?"
33198,lisa,"well, we went to pate labelle last week, how about that?"
33199,homer,"great, now let me think.  the food was ... [homer tastes"
33200,lisa, the food is delicious.
33201,homer,"ooh!  that's brilliant!  and they had this sweet, sweet"
33202,lisa,hmm. what's the english equivalent for ?
33203,homer,how about groin-grabbingly transcendent?
33204,lisa,uh ... i don't think so.
33205,homer,we make a good team.  a groin-grabbingly good team!
33207,homer,how about screw flanders!
33211,homer,whoo-hoo!  stop the presses!
33214,homer,"whatever, i'll be at moe's."
33215,marge,"this is so exciting homey, your first restaurant"
33216,homer,"marge, shh. it's important that no one knows i'm a"
33222,lisa,"wow, my first published article ... although someone"
33223,homer,welcome to the humiliating world of professional writing.
33225,homer,"look marge, i'm making a difference in people's lives!"
33228,homer,oh ... are you going to fire my for swiping office
33230,homer,"why you, you made them cancel ""platypus man!""  [shakes"
33238,homer,i've given out my share of bad reviews
33240,homer,it lost some points because it had a hot wheel on it.
33250,homer,this pea soup is as weak as the acting and nowhere near as
33252,homer,the other critics told me to be mean and you should always
33253,lisa,but what if someone bad tells me to ...
33257,homer," sorry marge, i'm afraid this"
33258,marge,you always liked my pork chops.
33259,homer,"marge, i'm sorry, but your cooking's only got two moves,"
33260,marge,you like shake n' bake.  you used to put it in your
33261,homer,"people change, marge.  my palate has grown more"
33262,marge,"oh yeah, what's a palate?"
33263,homer,oh ... it's a ... special time in a boys life when ... got
33264,homer,some come to the legless frog if you want to get sick and
33265,lisa,"dad, you're being cruel for no reason!  what will people"
33266,homer,people will think what i tell them you think when you tell
33267,lisa,not anymore!  i don't want to be partners with a man who
33268,homer,"nobody talks to me that way.  i'm homer simpson, the most"
33269,homer,i don't need lisa to write a good review.    the
33271,homer,"rough?  i don't know, you've been pitching that all night."
33273,homer,chewy!  that's inspired!
33275,homer,are you crazy?  a dog can't type.  
33289,marge,"homey, my women's intuition acting up.  something bad's"
33290,homer,"oh marge, something bad usually happens to me when i go in"
33296,bart,... so if we don't find dad this crazy french guy is going
33297,marge,only your father could take a part time job at a small
33299,lisa," dad, no!  it's going to kill you"
33300,homer,"eh, i've had a good run."
33302,homer,noooo!  [tosses éclair at a booth.  a large explosion
33304,homer,"oh, lisa, you saved me!  and after all the bad things i"
33306,homer,"oh, lisa, the important thing is i didn't get my"
33308,homer,i know honey.  the important thing is ... run!
33314,lisa,what do aliens have to do with halloween?
33316,lisa,i still can't believe we escaped from those horrible
33317,homer,but it was worth it to get back our super sugar crisp
33318,marge,"i'm having a hard time seeing.  homer, did you remember to"
33319,homer, guess i forgot to put the fog lights in.
33320,marge,"i'd better pull over and play it safe.  [pulls over, but"
33322,marge,"oh, my god!  we killed ned flanders."
33323,bart,you mean *you* killed ned flanders.
33324,marge,"oh, it was an accident -- an accident!"
33325,lisa,we've got to go to the police.
33326,bart,they'll never believe a simpson killed a flanders by
33327,homer," don't worry, i've got a plan.  okay, ned."
33328,homer,"hey, maude!  look who's helping me clean the chimney!"
33332,homer," relax, i'm fine.  but when i do die, i don't want"
33334,homer," wow, it sure is slippery up here."
33337,homer," hey maude, i'm home.  uh, oh, i think i'm having"
33339,homer,and that's the end of that chapter.
33340,homer,"when i think about ned, i can't help but remember the look"
33341,marge," homer, shut up, shut up, shut up!"
33342,homer,"oh, wait.  what i'd like to say is, we're still looking"
33344,homer,"we'll miss you, buddy.  "
33345,homer,"hey, we just got away with murder.  and it was so easy!"
33349,marge,who could be calling at this hour?
33356,homer,"okay, marge, you hide in the abandoned amusement"
33358,marge,it's impossible.  i killed you.
33363,homer, guess i forgot to put the
33364,marge,i'd better pull over and play it safe.
33365,lisa,so you were going to kill us.
33371,lisa,i don't think the real radioactive man wears a
33374,lisa,"[single-handedly lifts the grandstand above her head, and"
33376,bart,"whoa, lis, those x-rays must've given you super strength!"
33377,lisa,"bart, with these powers, we can become superheroes."
33393,marge,"remember, you're vulnerable to kryptonite."
33394,homer,"jeez, marge, tell the neighborhood."
33396,lisa,i don't think so.  [she and bart smash through the
33397,bart,"i don't think so, either."
33398,lisa,"your collecting days are over, collector."
33412,lisa,"bart, just let me drop and save yourself!"
33413,bart,what do you think i've been trying to do?
33419,bart,wow!  thanks for saving us.
33425,marge,and eleven with robert urich.
33432,lisa,"you did fix them, didn't you dad?  because even a single"
33433,homer,"that can't be true, honey.  if it were, i'd be terrified."
33438,homer,  i'm caught on something!
33439,marge,i don't want you looting.
33440,homer,but i was going to loot you a present.
33443,lisa," well, look at the wonders of the computer age"
33444,homer,"wonders, lisa, or blunders?"
33445,lisa,i think that was implied by what i said.
33446,homer,"implied, lisa, or implode?"
33449,lisa,they're evacuating the earth!  we're saved!
33450,homer,"thank you, sweet clown.  in death you saved us all."
33452,homer,i can still hear his voice on the wind.
33454,homer,"certainly.  i am ... the, uh, piano genius from the movie,"
33457,lisa,"actually, he's homer simpson.  that's bart, i'm lisa."
33461,homer,"goodbye, lisa.  remember me as i am -- filled with"
33462,homer,all that counts is that we're alive and rubbing elbows
33463,bart,"wait a minute, they're not so great."
33464,homer,"okay but there's dan quayle, courtney love, [increasing"
33465,bart, wait!  only that ship's going to
33467,homer,so we're all going to die?
33469,homer,the sun?  that's the hottest place on earth.
33474,lisa,do they really think cheapening the memory of our
33475,homer, i have to go to ze lobby!
33477,homer,you're not supposed to go to the bathroom without washing
33483,bart, it's a history lesson come to life!
33484,lisa,"no, it isn't.  it's totally inaccurate."
33485,bart,quiet!  here come the ninjas.  [fighting noises are
33489,bart, she's lying!  slice her head off!
33491,homer," oh, you don't want to get zorro mad.  [tips"
33492,marge,you're pouring hot butter on my leg.
33501,homer,why that little -- he insulted your honor.  [grabs a glove
33503,homer,i challenge you to a duel.  
33505,homer,"will you duel, or are you a coward?"
33510,homer,"oh, that's it.  you insulted my honor."
33512,homer,i demand satisfaction!    i
33514,homer,really?  but you never given anyone a free beer.
33516,homer,"wow, a free beer, and i owe it all to a little glove slap."
33518,homer,dueling at dawn.  how did it ever come to this?
33519,lisa, the national weather service says dawn
33521,marge,"oh, homer, i bet that southern colonel doesn't even show"
33522,bart,"yeah, he's probably just a big blowhard like you."
33523,homer," sir, that is an insult.  i challenge"
33524,homer,"he's out there, isn't he?"
33525,marge,"i'm afraid so, and his wife's with him."
33528,homer,"hey, i'm not dead yet.  "
33529,marge,why don't you have the colonel's wife save you?
33530,homer,"oh, marge, that's in the past.  just let it go."
33532,marge, hello.  my husband will be right

33544,lisa,"could you build us a house, president carter?  we can't go"
33547,homer,"c'mon carter, build us a house, you lazy bum."
33552,lisa,"where are we going, dad?"
33554,marge,then why are you driving so fast?
33555,homer,cause i'm trying to think.  what would zorro do?
33556,marge,holy moly!  we can't stay here; it's full of raccoons.
33557,homer,"just think of them as cats with rabies.  [a ""cat with"

33559,homer,absolutely.  this is our big chance.  the simpsons will be

33563,homer,that's my girl.  let the agriculture begin!
33569,homer,this car was made in guatemala.
33571,homer,i bought these shoes from a hobo.
33573,homer,"i'm sorry, i believe in good grooming."
33577,homer,"oh, that's just superstition.  "
33581,lisa,no thankth.  i'm thtill finithing my thithleth.
33582,bart,"dad, if we leave for town right now, we can still catch"
33583,homer,"sorry boy, going back to springfield would be a coward's"
33584,bart,wasn't skipping town in the first place a coward's way
33585,homer,"oh, you're right!  i'm a coward.  i made such a mess of"
33587,homer,"well marge, have you ever seen a field glow like that?"
33588,marge,"it's eerily beautiful, but are you sure this is safe?"
33589,homer,of course not.  but you know something?  sometimes you
33590,marge,you got that from a movie poster.
33591,homer,"well, when there's nothing left to believe in, believe in"
33593,homer,"from the producers of, ""waiting to exhale."""
33594,homer,"wake up, honey.  it's time to harvest our radioactive"
33595,marge,but it's only been one night.
33596,homer,"that's all it takes.  if we learned one thing from ""the"
33597,marge,but didn't grasshopperus kill chad everett?
33598,homer,only because he tried to reason with him.
33600,homer,"brace yourselves, everybody.  you're about to see the"
33602,homer,"aw, you're right, this farm's hopeless.  why didn't i"
33605,lisa,"wait, dad.  you don't have to kill yourself."
33608,homer, a sprout!  and there's some more!
33609,marge,what is it?  carrots?  peas?   maybe it's okra!
33610,homer,who cares what it is?  it's growing.  i've saved the farm!
33611,bart,bleh!  tastes like cigarette butts.
33612,marge,  that's odd.  the outside
33613,lisa,maybe the tomato seeds crossbred with the tobacco seeds.
33614,homer,"oh, great, i've got a field full of mutants."
33615,bart,gimmie.  i want more.  
33616,lisa,i thought you said it tasted terrible.
33619,lisa,"tomacco?  that's pretty clever, dad.  i mean, for a"
33621,marge,"well, i'm not crazy about the plutonium or nicotine, but"
33623,homer,"yes, it's the latest craze.  try some, won't you?  [offers"
33630,marge,can i interest you in a mincemeat pie?  they're very --
33632,marge,no.  but i use only the --
33645,marge,shouldn't we be talking about the $150 million offer?
33646,homer,"oh yeah, let's take it."
33647,lisa,"dad, it's a tobacco company.  they make billions off the"
33648,bart,"she's right, dad.  they can afford a lot more."
33650,marge,i'm with lisa.  let's take them to the cleaners.
33651,homer," there, there.  we had quite a"
33652,lisa,you're about to launch a terrible evil on the world.
33653,homer,"i know, honey, but what can i do as an individual.  i"
33654,lisa,just burn that plant right now and end this madness.
33655,homer,"i wish i could make a difference, lisa, but i'm just one"
33659,homer,"so, mindy!  how did you want to pay me the 150 million?"
33661,marge,it certainly is.  why don't you put down your gun
33663,homer,"hey, are we dueling or what?"
33667,homer,i think so.  the bone stopped the bullet.
33668,lisa,"dad, this might be one of those things you should go"
33670,marge,"num-num, maggie, num-num.  [but she keeps dodging the"
33671,homer, did someone say num-num?
33672,marge,i can't get maggie to eat.  maybe if you try ...
33673,homer,"oh, i'm twenty-six hours late for work -- no time for"
33679,homer,"over there.  [points to the springfield pd, which is in"
33681,homer, i'd hate to see the look on old burnsie's
33683,homer,[reaches behind him.  his hands find mr. burns'
33685,homer,no!  i can't get in trouble if i can't see you.
33687,marge," hello?  homer, where are you?  you"
33688,homer," oh marge, i'm sorry, i can't make it."
33689,marge,"oh, no, not lenny -- not lenny!"
33690,homer,"yes, i'm going to have to work late instead of seeing you"
33691,marge,"okay, sure.   kids, turn off the tv.  [they do"
33704,lisa,hey!  there was no accident at the plant.  dad just
33705,marge,"he shouldn't have deceived me, but i'm just so"
33707,marge,"now listen, your father really needs to concentrate, so"
33708,homer,why won't they come over?  i'm so lonely.
33710,homer,"thank you, bart's teacher.   you"
33712,homer, you've got a father.  he's just a dud.
33715,homer,"hey, this was supposed to be about me.  now any"
33718,homer,"[walks up to ron howard, who is center-bottom"
33727,homer,"well, yeah, uh, wait ... do i read from the sheet"
33734,homer,flavor of the month?  me?
33736,homer,"i don't know, because you weren't cute anymore?"
33740,homer," hello, everybody!  did somebody say, ""a"
33742,homer, i'm doing a walk-on.  it's a show-business
33744,homer,"hey, i thought you never talked."
33750,homer,"remember springfield, keep on swingin'!  "
33758,lisa,"dad, what she's saying is, you've had your moment in"
33759,homer,"lisa, i know what's going on here.  they did it to"
33760,marge,are you comparing yourself to our lord?
33761,homer,"well, in bowling ability."
33763,homer,"i can't believe it, moe.  the greatest feat of my life is"
33765,homer,"save your tears, moe.  save 'em in a shot glass for"
33769,homer,"well, world, this is it.  you know, i always thought you'd"
33771,homer,"oh, lord, you saved me.  i guess you had some higher"
33773,homer,"not anymore, ron.  now, i'm looking for something to"
33776,homer,that's great -- even big stars take their kids to the zoo.
33779,homer,that's it!  kids are the answer.  i'll dedicate my life to
33787,homer,i'm sorry maggie.  i never realized things had gotten this
33789,homer,what are you pointing at?  the ocean?  that's a great
33792,homer,"actually, that was before i went in the ocean."
33795,marge,"doctor, how could a little baby save a full-grown"
33797,homer,and all i care about is that my little girl loves
33799,homer, he's named after what he is.
33802,marge,"excuse me, where are your hamper lids?"
33804,lisa," ooh, i want to get the krünk."
33805,marge,"mmmm, you don't want something that overshadows the"
33806,lisa,"mom, no!  everyone at school picks on the pöpli kids --"
33808,homer,"hey apu, manjula.  you guys are still married?"
33811,marge," say, what you got there?"
33814,marge,maggie loves baby talk.
33816,marge,"oh,  sorry.  so, have you two"
33818,homer," kids are the best, apu.  you can teach"
33820,homer,"hey, apu!  sitting in the ice cream cooler, eh?"
33822,homer,who-o-a!  too much information!  thanks for the mental
33824,homer,"could you be any more ... hello?   look, just give"
33826,homer,"ew, thanks for sharing."
33832,homer,but the cans seal in the flavor.
33834,homer,"so, how's the tribe coming along?  any papooses?"
33836,homer,decided?   that's classic!  decided ... babies
33838,homer,really?  on top *and* underneath?
33840,homer,"well, don't worry, i can help you.  i'm all about ideas."
33841,homer,"now, this situation is guaranteed to end in"
33843,homer,"bup-bup-bup-bup.  that's an apu question, you're"
33847,homer,"my mistake, stay in the moment."
33849,homer,and that's my cue to exit.  
33851,homer,i just wanted to invite you to the wrap party.  and
33857,homer,"man, the last nine months sure were crazy."
33858,bart,i'll say.  i learned the true meaning of columbus day.
33859,marge,i enjoyed a brief but memorable stint as sideshow marge.
33860,lisa,"i became the most popular girl in school, but blew it by"
33861,bart,and then i learned the true meaning of winter.
33867,marge,"you have octuplets.  it rolls off of your tongue,"
33868,homer," apu, you should have seen your face when"
33873,homer, mine tasted like strawberries.
33874,homer,"free baby cola?  apu hits the jackpot, and i'm stuck with"
33875,bart,"gee, sorry for being born."
33876,homer,i've been waiting so long to hear that.
33901,marge,"apu told me all eight babies have colic, although he"
33902,homer,"eight babies ... i'm sterile, right, baby doll?"
33903,marge,"yes, dear.  from the nuclear plant."
33906,marge,"i knew you had your hands full with the babies, so i"
33908,marge,"well, you don't have to be sarcastic.  [yes he does,"
33910,homer," marge, they've turned into"
33915,marge,maybe you two should get a nanny.
33935,bart, i can't believe we're going to see the
33937,bart,"yeah, but now they're umbilical cords have fallen"
33939,lisa,how can he rebel?  he doesn't even know where he is.
33945,homer,"she's no liza, but it works."
33963,homer,don't worry.  i brought some chloroform.  [takes something
33969,homer,"please, mr. kidkill, look into your heart.  i know"
33974,lisa, are those real cobras?
33975,bart," some are real, some are just"
33979,homer,"okay, okay, don't panic, butch.  "
33982,homer, i remember television!
33985,marge,a fifties-style restaurant.
33987,bart,why don't we eat there tonight?
33988,homer,"ah, we'll go next month."
33996,homer,"oh, no, you're not getting me on that dance floor.  don't"
33998,homer,oh!  oh!  i need a dance partner!   what
34004,homer,"remember to rebel against authority, kids!  [roars"
34011,homer,"yeah, that's the life for me, marge.  cruising and"
34016,homer,a gang -- that's the answer!
34018,homer,"hey, don't make me hassle you, lisa."
34019,homer,the first meeting of hell's satans is called to order.
34025,homer,i'm the president the decision is mine.  we're hell's
34028,marge,you took a picture of me when i was asleep?
34029,homer,"if you'd been awake you would have said, ""no.""  you can"
34030,marge, her turn-ons include thievery
34032,homer,you're the hell's satans?  what a fun coincidence!
34038,homer," all right.  [cut to some time later, as"
34041,marge,"okay, meathook, i think he learned his lesson."
34045,homer,"caps and frisbees, sir."
34048,homer,"hello, police?  can you send a swat team to 742 evergreen"
34050,homer,but you have so much inner beauty.
34053,marge,"stop that!  if you want some food, i'll be happy to"
34058,marge,all it takes is the right cleanser and a little
34060,marge,just put it on my sewing pile.  [holds up a laundry
34061,homer,... and the bikers saw the hard look in my eye -- you know
34062,bart,"way to go, dad.  hey, where's the food?"
34063,lisa,and why aren't i at school?
34064,homer,"yeah, someone really dropped the ball here.  marge?"
34065,lisa,"dad, there's a note on the back of your head."
34069,bart,"  p.s., we've taken your old lady."
34071,marge,could you at least tell me what you're planning to
34073,marge,none of you?  really?  i could have sworn that
34079,marge,"you know, there's more to life than boozing and"
34081,marge,"no, no, i mean the dream of a good job, a loving"
34083,marge,"no, you don't have to kill anyone.  not if you have"
34087,homer,i guess i'll never find her.
34088,marge,"when you get a job interview, try not to call your"
34092,marge,"broke.  you ""broke"" your pencil."
34094,marge,that's right.  and what else have we learned?
34096,marge,"excellent, ramrod.  civilized people solve their"
34098,homer,"never -- it was a gift from ""newsweek."""
34102,homer,"what do you say, honey?"
34114,lisa," well, we could play clam traffic jam or the"
34115,bart, alright!  silly string!  [sprays glasses and
34117,lisa,"ugh, i'll be in my room."
34118,homer,what's going on?!   and i want a non-gay explanation!
34121,marge,why are you doing that?
34123,marge,sorry.  how long will he take to recover?
34125,bart,do all these people have to watch me?
34128,lisa,"principal skinner, i thought public schools were required to have"
34142,bart,don't need it anymore.  doctor says my butt bone's stronger than
34150,marge,what will become of our kids?
34151,homer,where are the refreshments?
34155,homer, maybe you should shut up.
34161,marge,"no, they're not.  they're terrible, terrible ideas."
34163,marge,what about mr. burns?  maybe *he'll* help us out.
34164,homer, forget it.  he releases the hounds on
34170,bart,i can't take mr. burns to the ho'pital 'cause i'm too dumb to read a
34177,bart,"oh, daytime tv is muy estúpido."
34189,bart,check it out -- i'm kicking books at a sixth-grade level.
34190,homer,"get 'em, boy!  hit those smart-ass books!"
34191,marge,"why don't you kick some books, lisa?"
34192,lisa,bart broke all my books.
34193,bart,you know what our homework is?  find a toy and bring it to class.
34195,bart,"i know, but i'm still not gonna do it."
34205,bart,"yeah, with lots of firepower."
34220,lisa," oh, a name with fun?  fungus, funzo, attila the fun."
34222,lisa," uh, just a few venn diagrams."
34224,bart, lisa's in trouble.  ha!  the ironing is delicious.
34227,lisa,don't you think there's something weird going on here?  we spent all day
34228,bart,"all's i know is i'm getting straight a's, and that ain't not bad!"
34231,lisa,this broom closet is not what it seems.  it's a secret surveillance
34232,homer,ugh.  is this gonna be like one of those horror movies where we open
34233,marge,"to be fair, not all evil robots are killers."
34234,lisa,"listen, when you see what's inside-- [opens the door and a mop falls"
34242,lisa,"""funzo""?  i said that name in class!"
34247,bart, mom!  i know what i want for christmas!
34248,lisa,"bart, they lied to us!  instead of giving us an education, they tricked"
34249,bart,"no, but if you're gonna throw a spas', i'll come with."
34250,lisa,good.  saddle up the bikes.
34252,bart,i want to see how this turns out.
34253,lisa, the phone's not even plugged in!
34255,lisa,you people took advantage of trusting schoolchildren!
34257,bart,let's just say he's a few prawns short of a galaxy.
34262,bart,"and i want funzo's dream fortress, funzo's lower back pain chair,"
34264,bart," three it is.  [writes ""3"" in book, breaking the pencil lead;"
34266,bart,it's always a party with funzo!
34267,lisa,"i admit it's kind of cute, but it'll never take the place of malibu"
34268,bart,yeah!  funzo makes playtime fun!
34269,lisa,they must have programmed it to eliminate the competition!
34270,bart,you mean like microsoft?
34271,lisa,"exactly.  come on, bart, we've got to warn everyone!"
34272,lisa,boycott funzo!  he's a toy-killing machine!
34278,homer,"so, who am i beating up?"
34279,lisa,nobody.  you're just gonna break into everyone's house and steal their
34281,homer," now, let's see ... this'll make three"
34282,lisa,"dad, dad!  you're driving on the sidewalk!  [the car lurches, and"
34284,homer," writhing funzos in my sack,"
34285,bart,"just dump 'em in the fire, dad."
34286,lisa,"yes, the madness ends here."
34287,homer,ha!  if i had a nickel for every time i've heard that.
34289,homer," please, mr. coleman, we can explain!"
34291,lisa,your toy company is evil.
34293,lisa,are you saying the end justifies the means?
34295,bart,"hey, don't talk to my sister that way!"
34296,lisa,"no, bart, he's right; i *did* over simplify."
34297,homer,"perhaps, but let's not get bogged down in semantics.  i think what"
34299,lisa,"lets just agree that the commercialization of christmas is, at best,"
34301,homer,"um, uh, mr. coleman, i've been thinkin', uh, my wife always makes too"
34312,marge," okay, here goes ... [walks quietly toward the"
34313,bart,cloning is a troubling issue.
34314,homer,i like the ones where the mouse kills the cat.
34315,lisa," what's in the box, mom?"
34316,marge,"this box?  oh, nothing."
34317,bart,are you sure?  you sound nervous.
34318,marge,"well, anyone would be nervous with all the economic"
34319,homer,get her!  she's doing something!
34320,homer,that was scary.  we came this close to losing our spare
34321,bart,"look, there's the box for my pitch back.  if i still had"
34322,marge, we'll never get rid of this useless junk.
34323,homer,useless?  this flash cube has two flashes left.
34324,marge,you guys never use any of this stuff.  look at these --
34325,homer,"hey, let's go skiing right now!"
34328,lisa," see, mom?  you conquered your"
34330,homer,"hmmm, ""the widowmaker?""  oh, that one's for the"
34332,homer, flanders!?  that's suit's a little
34337,homer,"oh, stupid sexy flanders."
34338,lisa, so hard ... but so rewarding.
34340,lisa,"but, they were trying to eat me!"
34346,bart,stomp that jiggle revert!  
34348,bart,can i go to the bathroom?
34350,bart,"um, i've got to blast a dookie?"
34353,marge,"uh, i think that's an armrest."
34355,marge,you mean like a hats and noisemakers kind of party?
34361,lisa, have you been here all day?
34362,homer,you missed all the fun.
34363,marge,skiing fanny-first into a crevasse isn't my idea of fun.
34365,homer, i want my wife to get the best
34368,marge,i can't be in the hospital.  tomorrow's laundry day.
34369,homer,"we'll be fine, honey.  the main thing is for you to"
34370,bart,"and don't worry, all the laundry and dirty dishes"
34371,lisa,"no, they won't.  we'll all pitch in on the"
34372,marge,"sweetie, it's nice that you want to take charge"
34373,lisa,"oh, mom, i've seen what you do around the house, and"
34374,marge,"oh, really?  well, knock yourself out.  just don't"
34376,homer,and you're interfere-on with our good time!
34378,lisa,"okay, now we're going to draw jobs from the chore hat."
34379,homer," come on, bikini inspector."
34381,lisa,"you know, the reason for the hat --"
34382,homer,"oh, it's a great hat.  no one's questioning the hat."
34383,lisa,will you at least do the dishes?
34384,homer,"lisa, i'll do the dishes when i pick it out of the chore"
34385,lisa,oh!  you're going to be late.
34386,homer,"oh, but lenny just got some bottle rockets."
34387,lisa,"you stay away from lenny.  and where's your sweater, bart?"
34388,bart,it unraveled on a nail.
34389,homer,that's not true -- he left it on the bus.
34392,lisa,"oh, those boys of mine."
34393,lisa,"bart, you were supposed to scour the pans."
34395,lisa,"you said that four days ago.  look, they're rusted"
34399,lisa, maple soda?  a cell phone
34400,homer,it's the bread of astronauts.
34402,lisa,"dad, i gave you a list."
34403,homer,"oh, yeah.   you were way off."
34405,homer," hello, lollipop island?  there's a"
34407,homer,"anyway, where were we?  hello?  hello?  they hung up."
34411,lisa, will you guys turn that thing down?

34765,homer,"i don't know; after living like a billionaire, this place"
34766,bart,"nah, it's not so bad.  here, we can spit on the floor."
34767,marge,"bart, stop that!   now, we may not have antique"

35377,marge,gold bars discovered by homer?
35379,lisa,"if i'm going to bail the country out, i'll have to"
35381,lisa,"see, that has the same problem.  we need to soften"
35388,bart,"hey, lis, i need a favor."
35389,lisa,"not now, bart, i'm about to speak to a hundred"
35392,bart,but you told me i should do something with my life.

35419,bart,"thank you.  down low!  [extends his hand, but retracts it"
35420,lisa," you're too much, bart.  that's why i'm"
35421,bart,wow?  you're really asking for my help?
35422,lisa,absolutely.  i want you and your pals to go away to camp

35425,bart,"oh, lisa's counting on me for this coolness report."
35429,bart,you mean lisa wanted to get rid of me?

35455,bart,"solid.  the rest of you go on home, and look in your"
35456,lisa,"thanks, bart.  you bought us some time.  what can i do to"

35487,marge,"gimmie that!  [grabs the camera by the lens, so all we see"
35489,lisa,"mr. gumble, you're upsetting me."
35492,homer,"you wish.  that's the stage we call, ""professor barney"" --"
35494,homer,"marge, you're making a complete fool of yours -- oh, it's"
35497,homer,disgracefully hilarious!  you passed out before we could
35504,homer,"wait a minute, barney.  you've got to be sober to fly.  i"
35510,homer,"oh.  my name is homer, and i'm planning a trip to st."
35512,homer,is there any other st. louis?
35514,homer,pffft.  not a chance!  i can sink way lower.  i just

35523,lisa,"well, it shouldn't be too hard to beat the old"
35534,lisa,"now, when the momma bird returns to feed her babies,"
35535,bart,"lisa, people these days don't want to see a baby"
35536,lisa,is that rainier wolfcastle?
35539,marge,you danced for hours just because they told you to?
35540,homer,"if i didn't, i'd lose their respect."
35541,homer,"so, you missed some big changes at moe's.  he hangs"
35545,homer,wasted?  what about our staring contests?  and the way we

35553,marge,so how was your ride with barney.
35554,homer,i don't want to talk about it!  [starts to cry and runs
35555,homer, stupid barney!  thinks he's too good
35556,marge,"cheer up, homey.  you don't need friends to be happy.  i"
35557,homer,but you've got me.  who have i got?
35558,marge, you still have lenny and carl.
35559,homer,"aw, lenny and carl suck!   please don't tell"
35560,marge,"well, if barney's that important to you, you've got to"
35561,homer,"oh, why can't i have a nickname?"
35562,lisa,"oh, we'll never get a good picture."
35563,bart,"hey, why don't we dump spaghetti on maggie's head?"
35564,lisa,that picture's a cliché.
35566,homer,"lenny, carl, i know a lot of people bad-mouth you and"
35571,homer,"well, if it isn't little miss ""i'm not wasting my life"
35581,homer,no!  you've got to be sober for this.  gimmie that.

35589,lisa,"no, you saved our lives."
35590,homer,i could do a lot of things if i had some money.
35592,marge,"kids!  the new phone books are here, and your picture's on"
35594,bart," whoa, cool, lemme see!"
35595,marge,isn't that adorable?  i guess some baby pictures were on
35596,bart,"oh, we'll be the laughingstock of the whole town."
35597,lisa,"well, at least we won the bike."
35598,marge,"actually, i took the picture, so i gave my prize to the"
35601,marge,just kidding; i would never do that.  [brings the bike out
35603,homer,yeah.  so what do you call this stuff?
35605,homer, it's not bad.  [secretly pulls a flask from
35607,homer,"ooh, my first issue of ""self-test monthly!""  finally, i"
35608,bart,i'm betting it's hunger and rage.
35609,homer,"yeah, but in what ratio?"
35610,homer,"okay, flanders, your love quiz score is ... 61.  that"
35614,homer," oh, yeah.  i saw a gopher.  what a day!"
35615,homer,"okay, last question.  who is your favorite back street"
35618,homer,"according to this, you're both idiots."
35620,homer," okay, there's a black widow at the door, a"
35622,marge,"homey, for god's sakes, it's two a.m."
35623,homer,"fine, i'll take the next quiz.  "
35624,marge, i don't know!  i'm trying
35625,homer,"okay, non-smoker, add eight years,  so"
35627,homer,i've only got three more years to live.
35628,marge,"well, maybe you added it wrong; let me have it.  [takes"
35629,homer,"see?  and these quizzes are never wrong, marge.  they're"
35630,homer,can't sleep -- gonna die.  can't sleep -- gonna die.
35639,bart,"hey, what's all the screaming?"
35640,lisa,"some of us have grammar school in the morning, you know."
35641,marge,"you should see a doctor, homey.  a head doctor."
35642,homer,i'm not crazy.  it's the tv that's crazy!  [yells at the
35644,homer,"you see?  gibberish, all gibberish."
35646,homer,florida?  but that's america's wang!
35652,lisa,look at the size of that gator.
35655,bart,do you have any hobo chunks we could throw to him?
35657,marge,"aw, he can crawl up through my toilet any day."
35659,homer, bring on the rapping granny!  [the crowd
35661,homer,all for homer.   all for homer.
35665,homer,"biotch?  moi?  [shakes up the bottle, and sprays kid"
35670,homer,"they called you a pig, sheriff."
35672,homer," we built this city, this kick-ass city,"
35678,marge,did you really have to handcuff the children?
35680,marge,you seemed so understanding before.  what happened
35682,marge,"homer, no!  you'll kill us all."
35684,marge,this family has hit a new low.  we're on the run from the
35687,bart,"sorry, i just want to be a broom boy so bad."
35699,homer,jimmy crack corn and i don't care
35700,lisa,"wow, look at all the stars you can see here."
35701,marge,those noxious gasses from the swamp must magnify them.
35702,bart,i'm getting used to this country life.  teacher says i'm
35703,marge,and y'all hardly ever bicker any more.
35704,lisa,"too hot to bicker, i reckon."
35705,homer,"you know, killing that gator was the best decision i ever"
35709,homer,"yep, this place is great.  and some day, when lisa and"
35711,marge,you mean when they marry other people.
35712,homer,"okay, but i ain't paying for two weddin's."
35713,marge,we'd be much better rock-breakers if we weren't all
35715,marge,"you know, you catch more flies with honey than with"
35722,homer,"well, what am i supposed to do?"
35723,marge,"okay, bart, i'll sweet-talk the sheriff while you"
35725,marge,restock the possum bar.  we're almost out of claws.
35727,marge,"my goodness, what a lovely suit, sheriff.  is that"
35729,marge,"well, the fabric really brings out the red in your"
35731,marge,"dang, i wish i could, but in august, our chain gang"
35736,homer,that's what we've been trying to tell you.
35738,homer,fine.  there are plenty of other states that are
35742,lisa,"north dakota, here we come!"
35743,bart,i always wanted to see mount rushmore!
35750,homer," aw, poor cyborganizer."
35751,marge," homer, sitting that close to the tv can't be good for"
35752,homer,talking while the tv's on can't be good for *you*.
35753,marge,you should get your eyes checked.  i'm taking bart to the mall
35754,homer,"nah, i want to enjoy this show before the network retools it."
35758,marge,we need something quick.  my husband's eyes are really shot.
35759,homer," whee! touch the sky, maggie!  whee!"
35762,marge,"come on, bart.  while your dad gets his glasses, we'll go shop for your"
35763,bart, i hate shopping.  just get me a deck of cards and i'll win
35764,marge,but you need to try things on.  every brand has a different idea of
35765,bart," i'm in tantrum position.  t-minus five, four,"
35766,marge,"fine, you win.  i'll do your shopping for you."
35767,bart,tantrum averted ... but now i can't forget the cat! 
35771,homer,"eew, she ruined the plastic ono band! [throws glasses on a large"
35773,homer,will it get me out of having to choose glasses?
35776,marge,"well, looks like we got everything for bart's camping trip"
35777,lisa,it got rave reviews from both the entertainment radio network and the
35780,lisa," oh, he'll never dance with her.  she'll have to"
35783,lisa," that's my name with ""bella"" on the end of it!  ask her!"
35788,lisa,she's not plain; she's beautiful!
35795,lisa,"oh, mom, i wanna be a dancer!"
35796,marge,"that's wonderful, honey!  we should ask your father, though.  where is"
35799,marge,i remember little vicki valentine.  her perky smile and dancing
35800,lisa,"well, i think world war ii helped a little, mom."
35801,marge,"don't smart mouth, lisa."
35805,marge,"alright, i'd like to sign my daughter up for lessons, vicki."
35815,lisa,"but i want to learn a dance i can use in real life, like the tango de"
35817,marge,"uh, little vicki, i really think she had her heart set on--"
35822,bart,wait a minute.  everybody thinks we're at camp this week.  we can
35824,bart,i've got a better place!
35826,bart,"yeah, it's just like my dad always says"
35827,homer,"for an evening or a week, there's no place like the mall.  food, fun"
35839,bart,warheads?  jelly bellies?  we're like two kids in a candy store!
35845,lisa,"what am i doing wrong, little vicki?"
35847,lisa,"yeah, well, no offense, but maybe i need a little more instruction than"
35849,lisa,"sorry, i'm just frustrated."
35851,homer,"hey, we got a postcard from bart.  ""dear mom and homer, i'm having"
35852,marge, why does it have a picture of vitamin barn?
35853,homer,didn't you ever go to camp?  the old vitamin barn.
35854,marge,there's our broadway baby!
35856,marge,"hey, dig that crazy rhythm!"
35857,lisa,"i'm just walking.  listen, i know i said i wanted to be a dancer, but--"
35858,marge,and you *will* be a dancer!
35859,homer,"look at you, all sugar and spice instead of equations and test tubes."
35861,homer,"now, honey, what were you trying to say before we kept interrupting"
35862,marge,"yes, our tiny tapper, what was it you were going to say after ""i wanted"
35863,lisa,"but, i just...  ...need more practice!  see"
35864,homer,"oh, what's that awful sound?"
35876,lisa,ugh.  the cat dances better than i do.
35886,lisa,"excuse me, why isn't my name in the program?"
35890,lisa,bu--  my parents are counting on seeing me dance!  and i've worked ever
35896,lisa, i got yer pulla-pulla-pulla.
35899,lisa,"most entertaining, but how does that help me?"
35901,lisa,"ooh!  that's brilliant, professor!  what will you think of next?"
35911,lisa, little vicki!  i figured out how to dance!  i can be in
35913,lisa,but-- but you don't understand....
35925,homer,shh!  this plot is hard enough to follow as it is.
35927,marge,"oh, there she is.  hi, honey!  wow, look at"
35928,homer,"yeah, that pressure we put on her really paid off."
35930,lisa,i can't help it!   it's the shoes!
35932,marge,"lisa's gone berserk!  do something, homer!  do something!"
35934,homer,"i didn't think, i ... just acted."
35936,lisa,"i'm sorry, vicki.  i just wanted to be a dancer *so* badly."
35941,lisa,you mean i danced all by myself?
35942,marge,"see, honey?  all you needed was to believe--"
35943,homer," what are you talking about, professor frink?"
35945,homer,"oh -- oh!  well, now that i look even closer--"
35946,lisa,"forget it, dad.  oh, i guess i'm never gonna be your broadway baby."
35947,homer,"that's not true, honey.  you can always write a"
35949,marge,"sure, it could be a story about people coming to terms with things."
35950,homer,"hey, yeah!  you could load it up with lots of swears!  that's what"
35953,homer,"why, it's just a cute little weasel.  hello there, mr. weasel. [reaches"
35954,bart,"tonight, on the discovery channel, ""inside lisa's nose"".  what will we"
35957,lisa,bart sleeps with raggedy andy.
35959,bart,"otto, a red traffic light means what?"
35964,bart,"otto, since when have you had a girlfriend?"
35973,marge,"homer, look, we're invited to otto's wedding!  ooh, and"
35974,homer,i didn't hit your precious table!
35975,marge,"ooh, we're ""cordially invited.  this saturday to join otto and becky at"
35976,bart, i told otto he could have the wedding here.  hope that's
35977,marge,"you should have asked first, bart.  weddings are hard work and cost"
35978,bart,"hey, it'll be easy.  you still got most the stuff from apu's wedding"
35979,marge,"alright, otto can get married here, but, homer, you have to get rid of"
35980,marge,"let's see ... candles, flowers, place cards, rice..."
35981,lisa,"oh, mom, you're not supposed to throw rice anymore.  birds eat it,"
35982,bart,why am i just learning this now? [grabs the rice box and video camera
35991,bart,"so, any words for the bride and groom?"
35993,bart,you don't seem to be trying very hard.
35994,marge,"oh, becky, you look beautiful.  i thought you might want to see this"
35996,marge,"well, the real key, according to sexperts, is mutual interests."
36000,marge,"oh, you can fix little defects like that with gentle nagging.  make it"
36013,marge,"well, it doesn't have to be.  otto's just going to have to decide"
36014,marge,"becky, what have i done here?  i'm so sorry!"
36015,homer,"in about fifteen minutes, i'd take off that wedding dress, or you're"
36016,lisa,"moe, can i give you some shrimp for the road?"
36018,marge,"becky, i know you must feel awful, but at least this didn't happen"
36019,homer,"yes, better now than when you're too old and fat to get another man."
36021,bart,"hey, why don't you stay with us?"
36022,marge,"bart, remember that talk we had about you volunteering our house?"
36023,homer, remember that talk *we* had about you not wrecking people's
36025,homer,ch-ch-ch-changes.  time to change the oil.  changes!  don't wanna be
36026,bart,a man innocently changes his oil when ... a two-ton car comes crashing
36027,marge,"now, lisa's going through this phase where she doesn't eat any meat, so"
36029,marge,nobody's ever called my gravy yummers before.
36031,marge,"ooh!  ooh, i've always wanted to use rosemary in something!"
36032,bart,"mmm, mom, this gravy tastes better than god's sweat!"
36033,marge,"thanks to our own spice girl, becky."
36034,lisa,"well, mom, *you* really brought out the mung in these beans."
36035,marge,"actually, that was becky, too."
36036,homer,what are these things in the mashed potatoes?
36038,marge,"well, nobody's perfect.  let me just pick those-- [reaches over to"
36039,homer,"[wraps his arms around his plate, preventing marge from touching"
36042,bart,"yeah, mom, i need something great.  milhouse has footage of himself"
36043,marge,"well, no kicking.  it's too dangerous."
36045,marge,"that's very impressive, but i still don't--  stop that!"
36047,lisa,"we're jamming, mom.  she's painting my music, and i'm playing to her"
36048,marge,"yes, well, i guess i'll go roll socks.  it's not hip, but it has to be"
36050,marge,"yes, i hate when things get worn out -- socks, welcomes."
36051,marge,"she's so helpful, and everyone loves her, and, well, this may sound"
36055,marge,dead in a week?  what are you talking about?
36063,marge,becky's going to seduce homer?
36074,marge,"that's crazy.  look, i know i don't have any proof, but this woman"
36076,marge,do i have to be dead before you'll help me?
36079,lisa,"come on, becky, tell us your big news."
36081,homer,"becky, i think i speak for all of us when i say ""when's the ice cream"
36085,marge,i thought you said the law was powerless.
36087,marge," this isn't over, becky.  i know where"
36088,lisa,poor maggie.  how many insanity hearings have you been to in your
36093,marge,it was healthy; he reciprocated.
36095,marge,"oh, i was just praying to god that you'll find me sane."
36097,marge,"oh, yes.  he's kind of everywhere."
36102,bart,"""kills again""?  she hasn't killed once."
36103,lisa,shouldn't we be out there trying to find her?
36104,homer,don't worry.  she'll show up here sooner or later ... to finish off
36113,bart,"the kids are saying if you say ""bloody margie"" five times, she'll"
36114,homer,"i hear she mates with men, then eats them."
36116,marge,"oh, my.  i've been so unfair to becky.  maybe i *am* insane.  i mean,"
36118,bart,"cut, cut!  mom, it's great to have you back, but you walked right into"
36119,marge,shot?  what--  what are you--
36121,lisa, and i'm directing the making-of video.
36122,marge,"oh.  well, then, i guess there's a reasonable explanation for"
36123,homer,"oh, about that, uh, when i changed your oil, i may have drained your"
36124,marge,"oh, boy.  my bad.  becky, i'm so sorry i accused you of trying to kill"
36126,marge,"well, that's a relief, too, knowing i'm not crazy.  so, i guess"
36127,homer,you monsters!  you killed her!
36130,marge,"oh, i've got too much to do to take a nap right now.  lisa, get maggie"
36133,homer, everybody wanted a piece of us.
36134,marge," they told us what to wear, how to dress,"
36135,bart, the cops found me driving on the
36136,lisa, i had no business hosting the oscars.  after
36138,marge,nobody told us how tough it is to raise kids.  they almost drove me to
36139,homer,then we figured out we could park them in front of the tv.  that's how
36141,homer,"our favorite show was ""hollywood hogwash"", but we also loved ""the dreck"
36142,marge,"...""the malarkeys"", ""dumbin' it down""..."
36143,lisa,"...""sheriff lowbrow""..."
36144,bart,"...""home improvement""..."
36145,homer,...but we never saw people like *us* on tv.
36146,bart,tv families were always hugging and tackling issues.
36147,marge,homer kept saying he could do a more realistic family show.  finally i

36158,homer,"every day i thought about firing marge ... you know, just to shake"
36160,bart,the funniest stuff came right out of real life.
36162,homer,"son, let's go out for frosty chocolate milkshakes."
36165,bart,"dad, i've never said ""cowabunga"" in my life!  your script"

36172,bart,we found a secret room that was filled to the ceiling with parachute
36175,lisa,"none of us had ever sung before, but mr. geffen believed in us."

36190,homer, i'm king of the world!  whoo-hoo!  whoo-hoo!
36191,homer,"right about here i realize something's wrong.  yup, there i go."
36198,homer,why did i take much punishment?  let's just say that fame was like a

36212,homer, who told you about those laws?  was it marge?
36213,marge,"hey, you've been riding me all day.  why don't you poop in your"
36217,lisa,right from the start i had a bad feeling about that gig.
36219,homer,"hello, iowa!  does anyone have a doughnut?"
36220,marge,"now homer, this is no time to be thinking about food."
36221,bart,"yeah, forget the doughnuts, we're here to *go* nuts!"
36222,lisa,what kind of songs should we play?
36223,marge,"something that swings, with the beat of new orleans."
36224,homer,"no, something that rocks!  that's the sound of today!"
36231,marge,"you don't have the guts, little man!"
36232,lisa," folks, we're just having a little family tiff,"
36233,bart,"oh, shut up!  always trying to act so mature!  i'm glad you make"

36247,lisa,"to prolong the run of the series, i was secretly given antigrowth"
36248,homer,that's ridiculous.  how could i even get all five necessary drops into
36253,bart,"when willie asked me to be a presenter at the new awareness awards,"
36254,marge,you just don't say no to the redheaded stranger ... and when i heard
36258,homer,what's she doing here?!
36263,lisa,so this whole thing was just a trick to get us back together.
36266,homer,"we put all the craziness behind us, and now it's time to get back to"
36268,marge,which homer writes himself.
36269,bart,so you *know* it's great! 
36272,marge,i can't believe it!  we won another contest!

36338,marge,"but husband, without the weekly pittance, how shall"

36344,bart,hello! lost lovable orphans!
36345,lisa,"hmm, bowls of porridge.  oh, this seems somehow"
36348,lisa,i wonder where goldilocks was?
36350,homer," boy, dumping your kids in"
36351,marge,what? you threw our precious babies into the woods!
36352,homer,here's a better idea. i know how we can replace
36353,bart,wow! a house made of gingerbread.
36355,lisa,"wait, let me check the book."
36356,bart,"aw, she seems nice. i'm going to go with my gut and"
36361,lisa,"you know, she's only fattening you up so she can eat"
36362,bart,"ah, what are you going to do.  [squirts himself with"
36363,lisa,"well, at least stop basting yourself."
36365,bart,what do you care? it's not like you have friends.
36370,lisa,oh yeah?  what's his name?
36372,lisa,george cauldron?   maybe he can fix me up

36376,homer,"oh, rescue you, stuff myself with candy, it's all"
36378,homer,"so, is that all you got?  huh?  huh?"
36379,homer," hmm, fish.  oh no!  that's me!"
36383,homer,"almost, just give her another 20 minutes.  [turns up"
36385,marge,"well, we're still poor, but thanks to your father,"
36386,bart,"speaking of which, how about seconds?"
36393,homer,it's getting away. kill it!
36394,lisa,go on! swim to freedom! go!
36396,homer,"two krusty shakes, a doughnut burger with cheese,"
36400,homer,intelligent italians? something's wrong ...
36403,bart,those dolphins seem bent on mayhem. we've got to
36404,homer,phone's off the hook. everything must be ok.
36409,bart,it's approaching the podium!
36416,marge,but you seemed so happy in the ocean. all that
36418,lisa,plus all that sewage we keep dumping.
36420,homer,it was her alright.   take the one

36437,lisa,"well, according to whatbadgerseat.com, badgers subsist"
36439,lisa,"stoats are weasels, bart.  they don't come in cans."
36444,bart,no.  there's a badger in there.  
36445,homer,"badger, my ass -- it's probably milhouse.  [crawls into"
36448,lisa,"no, dad, we don't want to kill him.  let's call animal"
36449,homer,great idea.  then we should call the doctor about this.
36450,lisa,how did the badger do that without ripping your shirt?
36453,homer,area code?  but it's a local call!
36454,marge,"the phone company ran out of numbers, so they split"
36455,homer,"939!?  what the hell is that!?  oh, my life is"
36456,marge,"jeez, you just have to remember three extra numbers."
36457,homer,"oh, if only it were that easy, marge."
36458,homer, i hate this new area code.
36460,homer,what really burns me up is they didn't give us one word of

36505,bart,"dad, you got syrup on your sash."
36506,homer,no problem.  [tugs on the end of his sash.  the part with

36518,bart, my homework is in your park.
36521,marge,"i don't know why, but i just didn't feel comfortable"
36523,marge,they were looking at me ... with their eyes.
36525,homer,hey!  the tv man is talking about us.
36527,homer,how the hell did they find that out?
36529,homer,"oh yeah?  they think they're better than us, huh?"

36553,homer,"anyhow, those rats will come crawling back -- we've got"
36554,lisa,"dad, the arena's in old springfield."
36556,bart,"don't give up, dad!  maybe we can get the who to play here"

36603,bart,"hey, we just took care of that dangerous melon that was threatening"
36604,homer,"yeah, we're heroes!  but where's *our* parade?"
36610,marge,"homer, what are you doing?"
36611,homer,"listen, do you want the job done right, or do you want it done fast?"
36612,marge,"well, like all americans, fast, but--"
36615,homer,it's gonna take a lot of fireworks to clean this place up.
36616,lisa, what's going on here?!
36617,homer,uh ... honey ... there's point in every father's life when he blows
36618,lisa,oh yeah?  you didn't blow up maggie's room.

36746,homer,"oh, right.  why don't we just break into fat tony's compound and"
36748,homer,for a casual acquaintance like you?  absolutely.

36920,bart,mercury ... venus ... earth ... mars ... jupiter ...
36921,marge,"well, we couldn't be prouder."
36922,marge,when did this happen?  when did we become the bottom rung

36978,homer,"i'd like to buy a mint condition ""spider-man #1,"" please."
36980,homer,"eh, no thanks.  i'll just eat it here."
36991,marge,where did you get that ball of money?
36992,homer,i've been doing some outside projects for mr. burns.

37008,homer,huh?  help!  mr. burns!  
37013,homer,maybe for you.  how come you didn't rescue me?
37015,homer,"well, you could treat me with a little respect."

37019,lisa,he doesn't want your dirty money.
37022,homer,"shh, shh -- the grown-ups are talking, honey."
37023,lisa,"dad, how can you put a price on your dignity."
37024,homer,"she's right.  yes, i may be naked and reeking of panda"
37026,homer,i retract my statement.  [burns shoves money into homer's

37033,homer,i see what you're saying.  i need to buy a gun!
37035,homer,i'm just trying to dig myself out of a pit of shame.
37040,lisa,i'm so proud.  my father will be the grand finale of the

37105,bart,they found a switchblade in my locker.
37106,lisa,"well, a web page is supposed to be a personal thing."
37107,bart,i took a swing at a cop.
37108,homer,they can't sue me if they don't know who i am.  i'll just
37109,bart,i'm just mad all the time.
37110,homer,"yep, you just can't go wrong with mr. ""x""."
37111,homer,that lousy pothole.  why don't they fix it?
37113,homer,get out.  who told you that?
37115,homer,hmmm.  that's the kind of dirt that belongs on my web
37116,lisa,you can't post that on the internet.  you don't even know
37117,homer,"nelson has never steered me wrong, honey.  nelson is gold."
37118,bart,"you know, it might have been jimbo."
37119,homer,"beautiful, we have confirmation.  [lisa sighs in"
37124,homer,i did it!  i've changed the world!  now i know exactly how

37126,homer,bring me two of every animal!
37138,homer," oh, i don't know, carl, he might be closer than"

37156,homer,"[moans from fumes, drops pad out of vent and onto"
37160,homer,"i'm mr. ""x""!  gimme, gimme!"
37164,homer,"thank you folks, and now i'm off to expose more"
37165,marge,i'm proud that you won the pulitzer ...
37167,marge,... but i do feed bad about the starving children.
37169,marge,"oh, well, that's good.   hmmmm."
37170,homer,"oh, nobody's visiting my web page anymore.  my counter is"
37171,lisa,"well, you can't post news if you don't have any."
37172,homer,that's a great idea!  i'll make up some news!
37173,lisa,at least take off your pulitzer prize when you say that.
37178,homer,"real news is great, son, but i'm getting a thousand hits"
37181,homer,how do i get out of here?
37183,homer,so i'm a prisoner.  how come?
37185,homer,but i don't know anything.  at least i don't think i do.
37190,homer,i am not a number!  i am a man!  and don't you ever
37192,homer,who are all these oddballs?
37194,homer,wow.  so who brought us here?
37199,marge,"oh, that's a darling name for a dog."
37200,homer,"oh, they drugged the tea.  they knew my one"
37202,homer,who are you and why are you holding me here?  i want
37206,homer,that's impossible.  all my stories are bullplop.
37210,homer,"of course.  it's so simple.   wait,"
37214,homer,"look, you can drug me all you want, but my family"
37221,marge,"well, i sure don't feel like cooking."
37222,homer,i'm tired of being drugged and gassed.  there's got
37227,homer,"oh no, an anti-escape orb!  [grabs one of the"
37231,homer,"if i know me, he won't like being kicked in the"
37233,homer,"oh marge, it's me, the real homer!"
37239,marge,"once you get use to the druggin's, this isn't a bad place."
37240,homer,"oh, it's wonderful.  truly god's country."
37241,homer, see you on the island.
37244,homer,beer!  yes!  how did you know?  [his gut bursts from his shirt onto
37246,marge,"oh, they ought to call that a *large* island iced tea!  [only she"
37247,lisa,are you really gonna to drink that?
37248,marge,"well, maybe a sip; i don't want to offend our mentalist."
37250,lisa,"mom, you're missing a great show!"
37251,marge,you don't *know* what i'm missing.
37253,marge, i'll do it!  i always end up doing it.
37257,marge,"that's no gentleman, that's my husband."
37259,bart,i wish she drank every day.
37261,marge,"oh, please.  i didn't say that for clapping."
37267,marge,"you talk too much.  abra-cablabra, am i right?"
37270,homer,so she was made of chimps!
37271,bart,man!  magic can do anything!
37274,bart,wow!  it's approved by the royal magic college of hyderabad!
37275,lisa, that's a party magic college.
37280,marge,"would you cut it out, you two?  mommy needs some quiet right now."
37282,homer,i know that!  how much to fix it?
37284,homer,"oh, i can't afford that!"
37285,bart,"maybe i can make some money, dad.  the magic act is really coming"
37286,homer,heh-heh-heh.  he couldn't breathe.
37287,homer,"come on, pony up, flanders.  the kid's not turning tricks for nothing."
37292,bart,"dad, only one of them is real."
37294,homer,sixty cents?  i would have made more if i'd gone into work today!
37295,bart,"hey, don't blame me, i've gotta compete with tv and the internet."
37296,homer,a good son would come through for his dad.
37297,bart,"yeah, and a good dad wouldn't miss his son's little league games!"
37298,homer,i told you -- i find them boring!
37299,bart,well *i* showed up for all your stupid interventions!
37300,homer,"oh, that's it!  you can walk home!  "
37301,bart,"dad, come back!  i can't walk home with all this stuff."
37305,bart,people.  i guess they thought i was a charity case.
37306,homer,"really?  hey, maybe we could do that again!  can you look even more"
37307,bart,but wouldn't that make us con artists?
37308,homer,"well, yeah, but ... god conned *me* out of 6,500 bucks in car repairs."
37309,bart,"so ... in a way, we'd just be balancing out the universe."
37310,homer,there you go!  we'd be stealing from people we know!  it's just like
37311,bart,sounds good.  want to eat my fat?
37312,homer,i think you know the answer to that.  
37313,bart,"this book has all the classic cons.  there's the pigeon drop, the ear"
37314,homer,they have any father-and-son grifts?
37315,bart,"well, there's the albany ham scam."
37318,marge,what are you doing?  why are you frosting that old throw pillow?
37319,homer,i could ask you the very same question.
37320,marge,mmm ... should i just back out of the room?
37322,bart,"okay, dad, are you ready for our first con?"
37323,homer,you bet.  let's trim the mark.
37324,bart,"nice use of the lingo, homer."
37327,bart,what happened?  where's my cake?  [worried
37329,homer,"what have you done, you clumsy little ox?!   that cake was for"
37331,homer,"no, no.  don't protect him.  [to bart"
37333,homer,"well, you're the mark.   ...of integrity."
37334,marge,there you are.  how was the magic act?
37335,homer,"what in the hell are you talking about?   oh, right,"
37336,lisa,how'd you do your act?  you left your magic kit here.
37338,lisa,"i don't know, mom, i think they're up to something."
37339,marge,"sure looks that way, but at least bart and homer are spending quality"
37340,lisa,it that a long island iced tea?
37344,bart,he's the bestest dog ever.  he's light brown and he has a spot on
37346,bart,"i just gotta get him back!  or, if not him, a similar dog."
37347,homer,dog for sale!  dog for sale!
37351,homer,although ... if the right offer came along....
37352,bart,why are we still grifting?  the car's paid for; doesn't that balance
37353,homer,"in a way, but i also remembered some other stuff, like my bike that"
37355,homer,"hello, is the lady of the house in?"
37357,homer,"oh, of course, of course....  it's just that..."
37359,homer,"...well, before she died, she ordered this bible especially for you."
37361,homer,"now, you weren't home, so we had to pay the delivery man."
37365,bart,that was too close.  maybe it's time to quit the game.
37369,bart,you don't smoke a pipe.
37371,homer,how'd you get wise to us?
37375,homer,"so, what's the pitch, old man?"
37377,homer,which one of you youngsters is abe simpson?
37379,homer,you've just won $10 million from that publisher's cleary dealie!
37384,bart,"oh, this is terrible!  now who do we give the money to?"
37385,homer,i guess we'll just have to haul the check back to headquarters.
37386,bart,"forget it, ed.  do you know what it costs to sign over a check this"
37387,homer,you're right.  we'd better just take this check back for shredding.
37389,homer,thanks!  it took a lot of grifting!  
37390,bart,"please, fbi man, don't throw us in jail!  we just made one mistake!"
37391,homer,"yeah, we're not criminals, we're just two crazy, mixed-up kids!"
37396,homer,"chief, i'd like to scare my son straight.  could i show him a jail"
37398,bart,"okay, we're all locked up now!"
37403,bart,that's not an fbi badge!
37404,homer,colgate cavity patrol?!  
37405,bart,that guy was a grifter.
37406,homer,"yeah, and he conned us good.  well, at least we still have our"
37407,homer,"lies got us into this mess, son.  from now on, it's honesty all the"
37408,marge,you were carjacked ... in the church parking lot?!
37409,homer,"absolutely.  we had stopped in for a quick prayer, when -- bart, would"
37410,bart,"definitely ... well, crazy about carjacking."
37412,homer,um ... let's see ... he was ... foreign ... and he had...
37413,bart,"wild, bushy hair -- like an animal!"
37415,homer,"well, he seemed like a loner -- kept to himself, mostly."
37416,bart,"and, he said if we went to the cops, he'd come back for maggie."
37417,marge," oh, dear!  we don't want that!"
37425,marge,"after we got maggie to a safe house, of course."
37427,marge,they always say they're innocent.  it's such a turn-off!
37428,bart,"dad, willie got arrested 'cause of us!"
37429,homer,"course he did, son!  he's a filthy crook.  now let's all hit the hay."
37430,marge,it's 10 in the morning.
37431,homer,i guess you haven't heard of chloroform.  
37440,homer,let's see how this plays out.
37442,homer,"i told you, my memory is fuzzy!  fuzzy!"
37444,homer,"yes, exactly!  no, no, i mean, the whole incident is hazy."
37446,homer,"yes, exactly!  [groans and tries to chloroform himself again, but"
37451,homer,when the time is right.
37456,homer,let's see where he's going with this.
37457,homer,stop!  this has gone on just long enough!  nobody carjacked me.
37458,marge," okay, players, that's a wrap!"
37461,bart,"wait a minute, this whole thing was a setup?"
37469,homer,but what about the guy who took my car?
37471,marge,"he's doing ""dreamcoat"" at the dinner theater."
37472,homer,i can't believe everyone was in on it!
37474,homer,"wait a minute, you're telling me the police force, the tv news, a"
37475,lisa,"i know it seems farfetched, even insulting to your intelligence,"
37479,homer,heh-heh-heh.  tremendous
37483,homer, lenny!  are you watching this?
37486,marge,"ready for the circus, homer?"
37488,lisa,<le cirque de pureé.>  we've had tickets since
37489,homer,but i want to watch brett <favre>.
37490,marge,"come on, homer.  they're only in town for eight months --"
37491,homer,"oh, i missed one of jerry's zingers!  now i'll never catch"
37492,marge,"finally, a circus full of whimsy and wonder."
37493,homer,"oh, yeah, that's way better than fun and excitement."
37494,lisa," as french-canadians, they don't"
37495,homer,"oh, i wanted to seem them fire a gorilla out of a cannon."
37500,marge,they always pick the guy with the wires.
37503,homer,"oh, no, you don't!  i paid full price for this freak"
37511,bart,"oh, everyone's off but us."
37512,marge,"oh, stop.  your father and i don't get the day off."
37525,lisa,this couldn't have less to do with christmas.  and i
37535,marge,this is terrible!  how will the kids get home?
37539,bart,"this stinks!  we'll miss the ""itchy & scratchy"""
37545,homer,"my car, your roof; it's only fair."
37549,homer,i never had a snowplow business.
37551,homer,"i think i know my own life, ned.   call mr. plow,"
37569,homer,"i hope it's flanders!  [laughs, then notices ned glaring"
37576,bart,i was gonna put buttresses in.
37582,bart,"what's the problem, seymour?  stuck?"
37584,bart,what's that?  you want the pee bucket on your head?
37586,bart,c'mon!  we're taking over the school!
37587,homer,"oh, stupid ice!  i always knew i'd die caked in something."
37589,homer,"wait, let's just leave it on 'til we forget our troubles."
37594,bart,"oh, boo-hoo.  after all the times i've done it, my"
37597,bart," ""underachiever and proud of it."""
37598,lisa," ""lisa is an outstanding student"
37609,homer,enough!  i grow weary of your sexually suggestive dancing.
37612,homer,i know -- ranch dressing.
37614,homer,we're free -- and we got something to eat!
37615,bart,"so long, johnny tremaine.  your newberry award won't"
37627,homer,"come on, kids.  let's leave this awful place and never"
37628,bart,"boy, that salt really ate through the car."
37629,lisa,and the exhaust pipe is leaking.
37631,lisa,and furthermore ... [metamorphs into a camel-headed
37632,bart," ignore her, effendi.  we have each"
37635,homer,"it's no use struggling, my beloved chalamala."
37636,lisa,merry christmas from the simpsons!  hooonk!  hooonk!
37637,homer,animation is so great!  it's way better than ... whatever
37638,marge,"seems like animated shows are everywhere; or were, last"
37639,lisa,"wait, i'm confused; why was a wolf shooting a web?"
37640,bart,cartoons don't have to make sense.
37655,homer,wait a minute -- was that cat making out with that
37657,homer,"[moves a bit tentatively at first to test things out, then"
37659,homer,thank you!  don't spay or neuter your pets.  good-night!
37660,homer,"i'd like to withdraw my life's savings, please."
37662,homer,"oh, yes, of course.  she's, uh, behind that plant."
37666,homer," ah, yes, i see that it's in bill"
37672,homer,huh?  what is this crap?
37674,homer,family meeting!  family meeting!
37677,lisa,"well, maybe if mom didn't make such dry waffles.  there, i"
37678,marge,"well, maybe if you'd eat some meat you'd have a natural"
37679,homer,point of order -- i didn't lose *all* the money.  there
37680,homer,i have a great way to solve our money woes.  you rent your
37681,marge,are you crazy?  i'm not going to be a surrogate mother.
37682,homer,"c'mon, marge, we're a team.  it's uter-us, not uter-you."
37686,homer,food?  i'm blind!  [screams and runs wildly around
37690,homer,there's a crayon in my brain?  [points to his chest.
37693,marge,"oh, homer, where have you been?"
37694,homer,i just underwent a procedure to increase my iq fifty
37696,homer,"and they gave me this spiffy nerd ensemble, too."
37698,homer,is the capital of north dakota bismarck?
37700,bart,i don't believe it.  say something else smart.
37701,homer,"dr. joyce brothers may be highly known, but her"
37703,homer,"hey, flanders, heading for church?  well, i thought i"
37705,homer,better.  i was working on a flat tax proposal and i
37708,homer,"i am here to give hope to the least of you, because"
37712,homer,"not being a moron, i wouldn't know.  however,"
37714,homer,"ladies and gentlemen, i give you your moron."
37716,homer,i've compiled a thorough safety report on this plant.
37718,homer,i've decided to disintermediate the local authorities and
37723,homer,"yeah!  [homer and carl high five-each other, then homer"
37724,homer," wait, you can't hate me."
37726,homer,"effigy, eh?  yeah, nothing burns like an effigy."
37733,homer,hmm.  i'm detecting a distinct strain of anti-

37767,homer,we were what-what in a what-what?
37771,homer,i dunno.  must be something i wrote before moe fixed me.
37774,marge,"sorry, homey, but you promised to take me to the apron"
37775,homer,just give me ten more hours.  [rolls over to go back to
37776,marge,"come on, you and the kids always want to do fun stuff."
37777,homer,"did you say, ""smockron?"""
37781,marge,there's so much evil in the world.
37785,homer,relax.  they got rodeo clowns.
37788,homer,"that's not going to do it, marge; you need something red."
37790,homer,"not now, honey, daddy's busy."
37791,bart,i don't have a blue shirt.
37792,marge,"how's your back, homey?"
37793,homer,"i can't complain.  [indicates a sign which reads, ""no"
37795,homer,"oh, god, my back!  it hurts so much!  and my job is so"
37796,marge,"try to focus on something else.  you like jimi hendrix,"
37798,marge,"well, look at that painting.  [points to a portrait of"
37799,homer,and his fondness for the guitar.
37801,marge,a convict painted that?
37803,marge,"well, i studied art, and this guy's got a real gift."
37808,homer,there's an air-in-space museum.

37812,homer,"well, there's a dull ache, certainly.  and overlaid on"
37813,marge,"oh, nothing.  how would you feel if i did some volunteer"
37814,homer,"first, i'd feel like having a blt.  then, proud of you."
37815,marge,"welcome to, ""freeing the artist within.""  not"
37822,homer,so?  just give me some drugs and surgery.
37824,homer,"yeah, there's some neat stuff on the front."

37829,marge,i don't see any anger.   i
37832,homer,hey!  it feels a little better.
37834,lisa,"so, how was it in the slammer?"

37849,marge,"uh, mecca?  well, let--"
37851,homer,"oh, my back!  dr. steve didn't do anything."
37852,bart,did you do those exercises he gave you?

38052,bart, shhh.  use your indoor voice.
38054,bart,look at all these bootleg videos!
38069,bart,it wasn't dad's fault.  the ape tricked him.  what's
38073,bart," that's actually a great idea, milhouse."
38076,bart,"i must warn you that once this next tape starts, it"
38098,bart,"yup.  and, we haven't been to school in days and"
38112,homer,"oh, the whole deal!  coffin, tombstone, anti-stink"

38132,homer,what on earth are you doing?
38134,homer,"*that's* tennis?  oh, then what's the one where the chicks"
38136,homer,yes!  that's what i wanted.  
38137,marge,"you know, a tennis court can really make your house look"
38138,homer,"yeah, it'd be nice to entertain friends and have people"
38140,homer,"keep walking, flanders."
38144,homer,"hey, this was a lot of fun, guys."
38150,homer,"wow, how do you come up with such witty remarks?"
38154,marge,chief wiggum!  are you here to make a bust of some kind?
38160,marge,would you boys like to play tennis?
38164,marge,i thought you had your own court.
38173,marge,"ooh, maggie, are your ears burning?"
38183,homer,"good news, honey.  i found a way to prove to the town"
38184,marge, what!?  we're not ready to compete.
38185,homer,"don't worry, the tournament's not 'till tomorrow.  [picks"
38186,marge,aghh!  get 'em off!  get 'em off!
38188,homer,"i'll be right out, honey."
38189,marge,"oh, that's okay.  bart's doing fine.  you just have"
38190,homer,now that's the kind of nagging i can live with.
38191,lisa,i don't know what this has to do with the civil war.
38193,homer,"looking good, honey!  i think you and i just might win"
38194,homer, i'm ready for the big tournament.
38196,homer," with that little outfit on, everyone's going to"
38197,bart,i am playing in the tournament.
38198,homer,it's going to be tough without a partner.
38200,homer,"well, good for you.  anyone i know?"
38204,marge,"um, there's something i should tell you."
38205,homer,the name of bart's partner?  i'm all ears.
38206,marge,"well, actually, the name of bart's partner ... is, um ..."
38209,homer," no.  no, no, no.  you're my partner."
38210,bart,"dude, i think the lady's made her decision."
38211,marge,"i'm sorry, homey.  we'll talk about it later, okay?"
38212,homer,"no-o-o!  [falls to the floor, and grabs marge's socks."
38213,homer,"hello, marge.  hello, bart.  how are the tennis partners?"
38214,marge,"oh, homer, i'm sorry to hurt your feelings.  "
38215,homer, don't touch me.  your hands feel like
38216,marge,i just wanted to win for once.  please don't take it as a
38217,homer, my manhood!  i never thought of that!
38218,bart,"we were good, dad.  they asked us to play in the krusty"
38219,marge,it's for charity.  it benefits victims of balcony
38220,bart,we can wipe out bc in our lifetime.
38221,homer,i don't care about bc.  i care about m. e. -- my
38222,homer,it's obvious what's happening.  i'm being replaced by a
38223,lisa,"dad, you're just going through a classic oedipal anxiety."
38224,homer,"well, maybe five bucks would refresh my memory."
38225,lisa, oedipus killed his father and married his mother.
38226,homer,eugh!  who pays for that wedding?
38227,lisa,"i'm just saying you feel threatened by bart, but it's all"
38228,homer,"you're right.  but just to be safe, maybe i should chain"
38229,lisa,"dad, i think you're overreacting."
38230,homer,i think you're under-reacting.
38235,homer," no, no!  stay away from my wife,"
38236,marge,"darling, you're so much handsomer than my first husband."
38237,bart,"i may have the looks, but he's the trophy husband."
38238,homer,that's they guy!   that's the
38239,marge,lisa!  did you make that awful effigy?
38240,homer,"hey, leave my teammate alone."
38241,bart,lisa's your teammate?  
38242,lisa,what's so funny?  i'm better than you.
38243,marge,"now lisa, you know that's not true."
38244,lisa,how would you know?  your backhand looks like a rusty
38245,marge,"why you little ... come on, bart.  "
38247,bart,telegram for lisa simpson.  
38248,homer, don't listen!  it's a trick.
38250,homer, i think he's trying to psych you out.
38251,marge,"look, we're all trying to have dinner.  so why don't we"
38255,homer,"hey, great.  listen, i need a new doubles partner.  my"
38257,homer,"yeah, but only to crush my wife and son."
38260,homer,hmm.  you seem less disgusted.  let's go.  [grabs venus by
38261,lisa,venus simpson?  you're replacing me?
38262,homer,"now, lisa, ""dumping"" is such a harsh word.  let's just say"
38263,marge,"once again, i'm outraged by this last-minute switch."
38265,marge,it's totally unfair for one side to have a professional
38269,marge,"honey, i'll make it up to you in bottle rockets."
38270,homer, everybody's been dumped but me.  i'm
38272,homer,my tennis stick!   who are you?
38275,homer,which one am i?  serena or venus?
38276,bart,you're andre.  i'm serena.
38277,homer,"ha, ha, ha -- you're a girl."
38278,marge,why don't we stop this nonsense?  i'm not mad anymore.
38279,lisa,"me, neither.  i'm just enjoying some world-class tennis."
38280,homer,"you know, there's a lesson here for all of us"
38282,marge,"after the tournament, let's go out for a nice family"
38294,homer,"hello? ... hey, moe!  we're watching you on tv."
38296,homer,"so, how's that bowel obstruction doing?"
38298,homer,"well, it all starts when a nulicule comes out of its nest."
38299,lisa," the answer is ""bonbon!"""
38322,marge,"well, i think it's a good thing for a show to go off"
38355,bart,"oh, it's you, bob.  how you doin'?"
38357,bart,"hey, i'm not afraid of you.  every time we tangle, you"
38359,bart,i thought i was your arch-enemy.
38361,bart,what are you going to do to me?
38364,bart,krusty!  that's the one man i would never kill!
38379,bart, this is for sideshow bob.
38384,bart,time to blow up the clown.
38423,homer,"thirty-eight!  that's roughly my age!  marge, after a lot"
38424,marge,"oh, please.  you get exhausted watching the ""twilight"
38426,homer, i can't believe it!  i'm actually running a
38439,marge,thank you so much for saving my son from that murderous
38441,homer,and thank you for assuming we're hip.
38445,homer,"now listen to me, smash.  we're not signing anything --"
38446,marge,why do you want bart?  he's not much of a singer.
38448,marge,"now, hold on; i have some concerns."
38449,bart,"please, mom.  my dream is to be a rock star."
38450,homer,and my dream is to get rid of bart.
38452,homer,how many lives must you ruin?
38457,bart,"wait, these are just guys from school.  who's next,"
38460,bart," party posse, we rule the earth,"
38469,bart,but we'd give it all up for that special girl.
38473,bart,"hello, springfield!  now here's a song that your"
38475,bart,"screw you, man!  we're going to play it anyway!"
38476,bart,i saw you last night at the spelling bee.
38490,bart,really?  you saw our bfn?
38500,bart,now we've got to get them a basket.
38504,bart,"your love's more deadly than saddam,"
38508,homer,  ee-van eht niojh -- you gotta
38510,homer,"ah, it doesn't mean anything.  it's like, ""rama-"
38512,bart,"so, sing it again, ee-van eht niojh!"
38514,lisa, they're recruiting people with subliminal
38516,lisa,you're being brainwashed!
38518,lisa,"l. t., thank god you're here.  the government's playing"
38524,lisa,"a wig!  but, but your pant legs ..."
38526,lisa,but you have recruiting ads on tv.  why do you need
38536,bart,"let's get back together, girl,"
38546,homer,"so, what songs did i miss?"
38547,bart,"dad, l. t.'s gone crazy."
38548,homer,"yeah, that's the look.  "
38549,bart,think he's going to do something dangerous?
38556,bart,but how?  we would need the ultimate chill-out song.
38574,bart,"aw, come on, guys.  we've only got a few minutes ..."
38576,bart,"aw, man, we could have been on the cover of ""mad."""
38578,homer,"""smellson"" -- it's funny because you smell.  "
38596,homer,"kids, how would you like to go to ... blockoland!"
38598,homer,but the tv gave me the impression that --
38601,lisa,"okay, we have our choice of rectangle land, cube country,"
38602,marge,squaresville sounds pretty cool.
38604,homer, check it out -- i built
38605,lisa,but you made it out of ham cubes.
38607,bart,ow!  why did i get this lego(tm) shirt?
38608,marge,don't you mean blocko shirt?
38609,bart,"right, right.  *blocko* shirt."
38610,marge,"lisa, how's your eiffel tower kit?"
38611,lisa,"it's okay, but it's missing a piece.  [points to missing"
38612,homer,"welcome to real life, lisa.  you can't fight city hall,"
38613,marge,what kind of thing is that to tell your children.
38614,homer,it's what i always tell them.  i told them that twice
38615,marge,i'm sure the gift shop will replace the missing piece.
38616,homer,"you're right, honey.  hear that, kids?   the"
38618,homer,you sold my little girl a shoddy eiffel tower.
38621,homer,"hey, any friend of marge is a friend of mine."
38622,homer,those bullies are gone now.
38624,homer,"my heart was in the right place, jerk!  [gets in the car"
38625,homer,i'm going to spend the whole day helping schmoes with
38626,bart,a girl at school won't go to the dance with me.
38627,lisa, bart's got a girlfriend.
38628,bart,"no, i don't that's the problem."
38630,homer,"don't worry, son.  i'll handle this."
38631,homer,"come on, why won't you go out with bart?"
38633,homer,"please, ""ugly"" is such a smelly word.  who would you"
38635,homer,"well, duh!  he's breathtaking.  but bart has inner beauty,"
38638,homer,"nice place you got here.  oh, look, a hairnet.  it"
38640,homer,"either you honor my wife's coupon, or a lot more"
38644,homer,wait a minute.  four hundred a month for loafer
38646,homer,you get the same results with a mincing gel.
38648,marge,"oh, homey, i live them.  i can't thank you enough."
38649,homer,the satisfaction of helping another human being is all the
38653,homer,"say no more.  i'll help you, lenny."
38658,homer, i'm sorry to hear that.  [spins
38662,homer,"okay.   so, uh, you wanna"
38664,homer,albuquerque isotopes?  what is all this stuff?
38666,homer,what a crazy room.  there's no albuquerque isotopes.
38668,homer,"you're moving the team to albuquerque, aren't you?"
38670,homer,"well, okay, but you can't silence homer simpson."
38674,homer,"wait a minute, will this erase my memory?"
38677,homer,"ow, my head.  how long have i been out here?"
38678,bart,all night.  you were yelling at the swings.
38679,homer,i was?  but i love the swings.
38681,homer,"you know me.  occasionally, i'll be quirky.  "
38682,homer,"members of the media, thank you for coming.  the"
38685,homer,"yes, that is an important story.  but so is this!"
38688,homer,let's see those aa baseball honchos ignore this!
38689,marge,you're really not going to eat anything?
38690,homer,my hunger strike will not end until duff admits they're
38691,lisa,"dad, i'm so proud of you.  if you need some inspiration,"
38692,homer," man, he really hates wayne rogers."
38693,marge," good-bye, homey.  here's dr. hibbert's"
38694,homer,"don't worry, duff's not going to let me waste away to"
38695,bart,"uh, dad?  [points to the skeletal remains of a woman in a"
38698,homer,"hey, kid and man!  don't support a team run by"
38700,homer,they're secretly planning to move to albuquerque.
38703,homer,"why, you little ... [lunges for the pair, scaring"
38704,marge,there's still more meatloaf.
38706,marge,"come on, come on, we all have to pitch in and eat your"
38707,lisa,why don't you just cook less?
38708,marge,"i don't do things that way, lisa."
38723,homer,huh?  what's going on?  what am i doing here?
38725,marge,it's been a whole week.  why are you letting my husband
38730,marge,he's not moving.  [looks through a telescope to see flies
38734,homer,"oh, i'm so hungry.  oh, why keep starving myself?  no one"
38736,homer,why do you look like caesar romero?
38744,homer," oh, oh, so hard to resist.  mesquite-grilled"
38764,lisa,that ad campaign may have crossed a line.
38765,homer,"eh, what can you do?  sex sells."
38766,marge,ah!  homer?  you're still here?  you should have left for
38767,homer,"they said if i come in late again, i'm fired.  i can't"
38772,lisa,"aw, it's tough being the new kid.  someone should go"
38773,bart,"yeah, somebody should.   one"
38775,marge,springfield baby-proofing?
38776,homer," you, you really scared us."
38778,homer, that's a pretty big caboose for a baby.
38779,marge,"homer, don't be ... wow, that is huge."
38784,bart,look at the new kids hogging the teeter-totter --
38786,lisa,give her a break.  remember your first day at
38788,lisa,"well, someone's got to make her feel welcome."
38789,marge,why don't you try reaching out to this new girl?  see if
38790,lisa,"hmmm.  well, lots of people like jazz fusion.  [picks up a"
38791,marge,"okay, that's in the ""maybe"" file.  what if you two bond"
38792,lisa," they're not dolls, they're"
38793,homer,that baby-proofing crook wanted to sell us safety covers
38794,marge,she's not afraid of bunnies.
38796,lisa,"uh, francine?  i think we got off to a bad start."
38798,lisa,"and you like the same one i like, with the grad"
38800,lisa, how about jazz?  do you like
38802,lisa,"milhouse?  she got you, too?"
38805,homer,now do you realize how unsafe the american home is?
38806,marge,i'm the one who told you that.
38807,homer,"yeah, but this is me talking.  look, i already"
38808,marge,how are you supposed to dial?
38809,homer,reach into these holes.  i use a carrot.  [holds one
38810,marge,"isn't that a little excessive?  i mean, how are the"
38811,homer,baby could order poison.
38812,marge,"oh, that's ridiculous.  [homer dials a number, then"
38814,marge,"oh, i'm horrible mother."
38815,homer,"of course you are.  marge, i've finally discovered"
38818,lisa,would you bullies be interested in some bodyguard
38821,lisa,"well, i'm going to need full coverage.  my bully is"
38824,lisa,"yeah, she's a real purist."
38827,lisa,i just don't understand francine's motivation.
38829,lisa,someone will -- i'm going to crack the bully code.
38830,lisa,why does the school need to watch us all the time?
38832,lisa,"come on, people!  move it!  i want to see some sweat!"
38834,lisa,i believe the key to bully-nerd antagonism lies in your
38836,lisa,"excellent.   now, don't"
38838,lisa,"mr. tatum, do you mind if i swab you with this damp"
38840,lisa,please?  it's for science.
38843,lisa,shh!  it's working -- look!
38850,homer,"that's me!  [gets off the couch, dancing and"
38855,homer,"dear god, what have i done?"
38857,lisa," my study is called, ""airborne"
38862,lisa,"actually, it's just ordinary salad dressing.  [crowd"
38863,marge,so that's where that went.
38864,lisa,the pungent vinegar and tangy roquefort block the
38868,marge,"oh, honey, we're so proud of you.  "
38869,homer,so all her bullying was just to get some attention.
38870,lisa,"no, dad, didn't you listen to anything i said?"
38871,homer,just to get some attention.
38872,homer," ""olive oil, asparagus"" ... if your mother"
38873,bart, i need this candy for school.
38874,homer,"well, okay, but get five bags in case i eat four on the"
38875,lisa,my teacher said i need cupcakes.  cupcakes to learn.
38879,lisa,"we need these because, we have to ... "
38883,homer,wait -- i changed my mind.  stack it in the order
38885,homer,customer's always right; that's what everybody likes
38896,homer,"no, i can handle it.   i'll"
38898,homer,so hungry.  there's gotta be some food left.  [pulls a
38899,marge,most of it was sent by relatives who couldn't see very
38901,bart,"whoa, a solid gold animal cracker."
38902,lisa," ""find the golden giraffe and we'll send you"
38903,homer,africa!  they're bound to have food there!
38904,homer,... and on my free african safari i want to everything on

38917,homer,"on the plane, i'm going to need two seats, [points to his"
38918,homer,the simpsons are going to africa.
38926,lisa,isn't that cute?  a bushbaby.  [indicates the animal
38930,marge,just like jimmy carter.
38931,bart,"help!  ooh, this mosquito net's not working."
38933,lisa,when do we get to see the animals?
38935,marge,"homey, did you remember to tip kitenge?"
38938,bart,all right!  i got another one.  [marks a picture of a
38939,lisa,"hey, you didn't see a warthog."
38940,bart,i'm looking at one right now.
38941,lisa,"mom, bart implied i was a warthog!"
38943,bart,what about him?  [camera pulls back to reveal a warthog
38947,lisa,"wait, rhinos don't come from eggs."
38948,homer,"what did you just see, lisa?"

38960,homer,"okay, here's the situation"
38961,homer,"so, do you think they settled that bag boy strike yet?"
38962,lisa,"oh, no, we're heading toward victoria falls!"
38963,homer,here's why they shouldn't get anything.  one--
38964,homer,whew.  this flower saved our lives!
38965,marge,"oh, no, it's eating us!"
38966,homer,"not a chance.  [pushes through one of the petals, and the"
38967,bart,"wow, dad, how did you do that?"
38970,homer,"i told you, yes.  now, bart, go to the top of that hill,"
38973,bart, okay.  [he takes only a few steps before a
38976,bart,"hey, maybe he'll lead us to bananas."
38977,homer,or more mouth-watering monkeys.
38978,lisa,"this is the place i've read about, where dr. bushwell"
38979,marge,"oh, isn't that sweet?  he named it after his wife."
38980,lisa,"no, dr. bushwell is a woman."
38981,marge,"well, now i've heard everything."
38982,marge,"it's kind of you to take us in, dr. bushwell."
38983,bart,yeah.  thanks for the grub.
38985,bart,"whatever.   ah, there's a"
38986,lisa,"your work has really inspired me, doctor, and i love"
38988,homer,so i noticed your home smells of feces.
38990,homer,"and not just monkey feces, either."
38992,marge,"i, i love what you've done with these poles."
38994,homer,you must be the most boring woman on earth.
38997,homer,anything for these noble animals.  [watches a chimp
39000,lisa,"well, if you really cared about chimps, you'd know"
39004,lisa, the chimps are running a diamond mine!
39008,lisa,how could you exploit your beloved chimps like this?
39009,bart,i think we should look at her research before we condemn
39010,lisa,these are just pictures of monkeys from famous
39012,marge,"don't worry, doctor.  we'll get you all the help you"
39016,bart,"hey, lis, check it out.  [holds two diamonds up to"
39018,homer,"hey, look!  our tour guide got a new job."
39019,marge,hmm.  quite a promotion.
39020,homer,i was wondering what became of him.
39021,marge,what happened to president muntu?
39023,homer, he got overthrown!  now he's just a
39024,homer,"aw, cereal?  you know i like my breakfast fried, or"
39025,marge,it's that healthy cereal from europe.  meuslix.
39028,lisa,yuch.   i'll get us out of this.
39029,homer," no, lisa.  but i sure don't want to eat this"

39031,homer,"well, let's put him to the test.   me love beer."
39033,homer,"aw, he loves beer.  here, little fellow.  [pours a handy"
39036,homer,i'm sorry.  i thought he was a party robot.
39037,lisa,"ugh.  this is why i can't have nice things.  [growls,"
39038,homer,"oh god, oh god, oh god!"
39039,marge,i'm sorry!  i'm so sorry!
39040,homer,"sorry doesn't put thumbs on the hand, marge!"

39047,homer,you want people food?  i can give you people food.
39050,marge,"we've got to get to the hospital, homer."
39051,homer,"okay, if the doctor asks why you cut it off, you caught me"
39052,marge,let's just say that bart did it.
39056,homer,but i have finger insurance.
39058,marge,isn't there anything you can do?
39061,marge,hibbert's really losing it.  we're going to dr.

39064,homer,"[puts the thumb in the pickled-egg jar, and takes the jar"
39066,homer,"well, i really shouldn't, what with my massive blood loss"
39067,homer,"hey, thanks for stopping."
39073,lisa,yuch.   i'll get us out of this.
39074,homer," no, lisa.  but i sure don't want to eat this"

39078,homer,i'm sorry.  i thought he was a party robot.
39079,lisa,"ugh.  this is why i can't have nice things.  [growls,"
39080,lisa,"hang on, linguo.  you'll be up and conjugating in no time."
39082,lisa,"quiet, please!  some of us are trying to weld."
39083,lisa,almost done -- just lay still.
39085,lisa,i knew that.  just testing.
39087,lisa,"""sentence fragment"" is also a sentence fragment."
39091,lisa,"can you take me to school, krusty?"
39096,lisa,huh?  this isn't miss hoover's class.
39098,lisa,what's happening?  where am i?
39100,lisa,*west* springfield!?  i'm at the wrong school!
39102,lisa,sorry.  i was rushing because i'm at the wrong
39104,lisa,you know about i. m. pei?  i. m. impressed.
39108,lisa,what do your friends call you?

39115,lisa,"chief wiggum, can you take me to school?  it's an"
39118,lisa,that sounds like fat tony.
39130,bart,whoa.  how'd you find it?
39144,bart," ""hootie and the blowfish""?"
39146,bart,"knock, knock.  excuse me.  my friend and i were"
39162,homer,"oh, thank goodness everyone's okay."
39163,marge,"except your thumb, and lisa's science project."
39166,lisa,"as the circulation returns, the subject prepares for a"
39170,marge,boy this sure was one crazy day.  [mr. teeny jumps into
39172,lisa,"wow, look at all these flavors!  blessed virgin"
39179,marge,can i have a swirl of chocolate and vanilla?
39183,marge,"rachel jordan?  isn't that the woman you had a crush on,"
39185,lisa,"are you blushing, mr. flanders?"
39189,homer,he can't admit he likes her until he's sure she likes him
39191,homer, flanders has cooties!  flanders has cooties!
39200,homer," ooh, she wants to know how your life"
39203,homer," ooh, she wants to have coffee"
39205,homer," he can hear you, rachel."
39208,homer,hotel?  why don't you just stay at ned's place?
39210,lisa,we're the neighbors and we don't think.
39220,marge,poor ned.  he can't look anywhere without being reminded
39221,homer,"yep, a lifetime of memories.  [with one hand, he sweeps"
39222,marge,homer!  don't you have any respect?
39223,homer,"sure, of course i do.  but life goes on, ashes to ashes;"
39224,lisa,"don't throw this away, it's rod's first tooth."
39225,bart,you're right -- we could use this for witchcraft.
39228,bart,kind of.  [the machine finishes shredding a pillow that
39229,homer,now for the awkward part.  we gotta talk about money.
39231,lisa,you said we were doing this out of friendship.
39232,homer,what?  that doesn't sound like me.
39235,homer," huh, is that a fact, you think you"
39237,lisa,it looks like an amusement park.
39250,marge,"ned, i'm worried about you.  you've been working non-stop"
39252,homer,she's still bossing you around from beyond the grave?
39254,lisa,how about asking the community for donations?
39256,homer,i am.  i'd be glad to spearhead the entire begging
39258,homer,no problem.  i'll need a sack and something sharp.
39282,lisa,he's speaking in tongues!
39289,homer,"i'm sorry, the ticket price doesn't cover visions,"
39290,bart,"yeah, folks, the power of christ compels you to give ned"
39304,homer,could get hurt.  *could.*  there's a chance they won't.
39321,homer,i think ned is going to be all right.
39329,bart,but the black man said ...
39338,homer,"wooo!  you da' man, carl!  i believe you can fly!"
39340,homer,"okay guys, i've got a secret play i've been saving"
39342,homer,"eat my dust, mortals!  [homer collides with"
39344,homer,did you say -anterior-?
39348,homer,maybe a little morphine would refresh my memory?
39350,homer,"hey man, you're harshing my buzz."
39352,homer,maybe a little morphine would get me there quicker.
39354,lisa,so many times we've seen our father go under the knife.
39355,marge," one more, and i get a free"
39357,marge,what spinal cord injury?
39359,homer,miss work?  but my life would be nothing without the
39361,homer,"but ""doctor screwlittle"" sounded like a delightful"
39363,bart,"sorry, i've got a baseball game in fifteen minutes."
39364,lisa,"and i've got a rally for ""take back the afternoon"".  [also"
39373,homer,"oh, it feels so good to talk to another human being!"
39375,homer,"well, marge isn't here.  she had to identify a body"
39376,marge,that's not my uncle lou ... and this man's not dead.
39380,homer,"well, they would keep me company ... and this pickle"
39382,homer,"sure, knock yourself out.  and call me homer."
39384,homer,"well, daddy's not here, is he?  hehehe.  [rod and todd"
39392,homer," yeah, well ... how was the"
39394,homer,"hey, it was fun.  my kids are sick of all my"
39397,homer,don't tell me what i'm not doing.
39399,homer,"oh, you'd like that, wouldn't you?"
39401,homer,"then i'll do it, just to see the look on your face."
39403,marge,we're calling it day care.
39405,homer,"ah, aren't they sweet.  any medical things i should know"
39407,bart,"hey homer, i thought you were only going to do this day"
39408,homer,"yes, but then i discovered the joys of raising children."
39410,homer,"don't worry honey, you'll have children of your own some"
39413,bart, you haven't seen the real homer ... it's
39418,homer, if your happy and you know it say a swear
39422,marge,"homer, this man is from the good guy awards!"
39424,marge,i contributed by not objecting too much.
39427,homer,is there a snack table?
39429,homer,heehehehee ... [starts gorging.  a cameraman comes to film
39431,homer,my kids wear these hearts to remind them they are always
39433,homer,"yes, through the magic of caring."
39435,bart,there's got to be a way to get back at dad.
39436,lisa,well ... i've been cutting the felt kinda crooked.
39437,bart,"no, we've got to show the world what homer's really like."
39444,homer, please let me win this lord ... [waving
39446,homer,yes!  all my love has come back in trophy form!
39449,bart,"big phony!   this is the real homer,"
39452,homer," oh, i almost had a straight."
39455,lisa,we just spliced in some home movies ... what do you
39456,homer,"well, i'd rather reserve judgement until i ... oh my"
39459,homer, that is completely taken out of
39468,homer,i'll tell you where we -not- going ... jail!
39474,homer,"why did you rat me out, kids?  was it because i showered"
39477,homer,"well, i learned my lesson.  [taking framed license off"
39478,marge,the teamsters said they'd pick it up by five.
39480,marge,i can't believe it!  we won another contest!
39481,homer,the simpsons are going to delaware!
39482,lisa,i want to see wilmington!
39483,bart,i want to visit a screen door factory!
39484,homer,the simpsons are riding the rails!
39485,bart,cool; dead hobo!  [pokes him with a stick.  the hobo wakes
39487,homer,w-what are you going to do to us?
39491,marge," um, excuse me, hobo.  could you play"
39498,lisa,"excuse me, paul bunyan never fought rodan.  and his size"
39501,homer,"we've been together a long time, now.  when are we gonna"
39502,marge,soon.  i just need a few more yoga classes.
39505,homer,"oh, i get it.  when i'm crushing and killing you, you"
39507,homer,woo hoo!  i'm mr. popular!
39509,bart,"boy, that story had everything"
39511,lisa,got any more tall tales?
39513,homer,"all right, but your next story better be worth it."
39520,homer," cleaning my gun with the safety off,"
39521,lisa,"dad!  you just killed a poor, defenseless buffalo."
39522,homer,a poor *delicious* buffalo.  he'll be dinner for the whole
39523,lisa,why'd you kill another one?
39525,lisa,mom!  dad!  look what i found!
39526,homer,"oh, boy!  buffalo testicles!  [takes two apples and starts"
39527,lisa,"no, dad, they're apples."
39529,lisa,"well, that's it.  i don't want anything to do with this"
39530,homer," i haven't had buffalo in six hours.  marge, how"
39531,marge,the buffalo are gone.  i think you shot them all.
39532,homer,"oh, connie was right!  we wiped out the entire species!"
39533,bart,"calm down, pa.  there's two left.  "
39537,lisa,"stop, everybody!  i've got apples!  delicious,"
39545,lisa,don't forget apple sauce.
39551,lisa,"that's not a tall tale, it's a book by mark twain."
39554,bart,"morning, friend.  want your turn at whitewashing?"
39558,lisa,"now, huckleberry finn!  you get down from there.  a body"
39561,marge, how romantic.  this reminds me of our
39565,homer,no wonder he was pooping so much!
39570,bart," hmm, looks like we're out of corn pone,"
39591,homer,"i like that story, cause i was a judge."
39593,marge,"hmm.  well, this is our stop.  would you like to come"
39594,lisa,we're going to visit the place where j. c. penney sends
39596,homer,ohh.   i'll meet you in wilmington.  [gets back
39598,homer," raise your arms ... okay, the"
39600,homer,"oh, it shows.  i was going to say something, but i thought"
39602,homer,"and it's important to feel good about yourself.  okay,"
39603,homer,"ah, ethnictown -- where hard-working immigrants dream of becoming lazy,"
39604,marge,"oh, listen, you can hear the beautiful ethnic serenade!"
39608,homer," wait, this is just a shaved puppy."
39618,homer,"a fortuneteller?!  oh, no you don't.  this phony gypsy just wants to"
39623,marge,mmm ... so it *is* noticeable.
39625,marge,i don't know; i woke up like this.
39626,bart,"oh, cool!  you could be in a freak show!"
39627,homer,"don't talk to the bearded lady like that, you little ... !"
39628,marge,"gee, you strangle him all the time, and that never happens."
39629,homer,"oh, he's fine -- it's just a growth spurt.   good"
39630,marge,"homer, it's that evil gypsy's curse.  we're all being punished because"
39631,homer,"marge, that ""curse"" is just a lot of silly superstition.  right, lisa?"
39634,homer,leprechaun?  don't they live in ireland?
39639,bart,"okay, let's see ... nymph, fairy, pixie, goblin--"
39641,bart,"sorry.  nymph, nyad, wood sprite, katie couric, and ... bingo!"
39642,homer, up!  let's make sure he's a
39645,marge,"homer, catching that leprechaun didn't help anything!"
39646,lisa,maybe you need to take the leprechaun and sic it on the gypsy.
39647,homer,"good idea, mr. ed.  wanna come along, noodle neck?"
39648,bart, can't live this way anymore ...
39650,homer,"i know you don't remember me, but here's a little revenge ... irish"
39659,marge,the best thing about a gypsy wedding is i'm not the hairiest
39660,homer,yep.  everything worked out for the best.
39662,homer,"well, me saying i'm sorry won't bring him back."
39663,marge,the gypsy said it would.
39664,homer,she's not the boss of me.
39667,marge,that voice could use a little personality.
39668,lisa," oh, let's try matthew perry."
39670,bart,neh.  who else we got?  
39672,lisa,isn't that the voice that caused all those suicides?
39674,bart,"hey, how about double-oh seven?"
39676,lisa,"no, pierce brosnan.  a voice like his would give our house a much-"
39677,marge,"alright, but i'm doing this because he was remington steele."
39682,marge," ooh, that really covers the cat crap!"
39683,marge,"pierce, that was delicious!  can we help you with the dishes?"
39687,marge,oh ... uh ... not a very good one?
39690,homer,trusting every aspect of our lives to a giant computer was the
39698,marge,"heh, sorry.  sometimes i forget.  "
39700,marge,"oh, pierce, the water's perfect!"
39702,marge,"oh, you don't have to do--"
39705,homer,"yup, that's the price of success."
39707,homer,what's by blood alcohol?
39713,homer,"lucky, schmucky!  i knocked her up.  but, she's stuck now -- we're"
39719,marge,that sounds like a lie.  [gasps as she notices on a family portrait
39722,marge,"oh, this seems like such a waste.  i mean, he *was* charming and witty."
39723,lisa,"there must be someone who can use a man around the house, even if he's"
39741,bart,i studied.   abra-ca ... turn-into-a-prince-guy?
39746,bart, get in there!  defend my honor!
39748,lisa,"bart, you're getting vomit on my prince!  "
39757,bart,i'd like that.  i'd like that very much.
39759,bart,"hey, hey!  you made your sale."
39764,lisa,"bart, let's stop this stupid rivalry.  even if you never become a"
39765,bart,"thanks, lis.  now let's try to forget this nightmare."
39778,bart,"big deal, it's just saltines and fig paste."
39780,bart,"hey, check it out -- wiggum's cruiser!"
39782,bart,"aw, man, that would really keep your head dry!"
39787,bart,check this out!   you there!  put
39794,marge,it's about the only thing we do as a family anymore.
39803,homer, i'll bring the car around.
39809,bart,"it was an accident, ma'am."
39812,homer, what did she say about cupcakes?
39814,homer,"uh, your honor, i was chasing the kbbl party penguin prize"
39816,homer,and a blue oyster cult medallion.  [holds it up and
39818,homer,"your honor, if may sing a little bit of, ""don't fear the"
39820,homer,i couldn't agree more.  perhaps some sort of court-
39828,homer,it's a little tight.  [indeed -- his hand's turning
39830,homer,i used to be.  [breaks down sobbing.  he runs from
39831,homer,this punishment is so cruel.
39833,bart,can that judge do this to us?
39834,lisa,creative sentencing is common these days.  that's
39839,homer,"come on, these kids are never going to use that stuff."
39841,homer,"fine.  [curls up on the floor, and starts snoring.  bart"
39847,homer,"i thought i would hate working nights, but it's so"
39848,bart,"can i ask you something, dad?"
39850,bart,"if towns keep getting bigger, will there always be enough"
39851,homer," aw, son, you know that's none of your business."
39852,bart,"uh, i don't think our house has a steeple."
39853,homer," oh, yeah.  i forget things sometimes."
39859,homer,that's my little slugger.
39860,bart,"come on, dad, let's go.  [yanks his end of the tether,"
39861,homer,"hey, knock it off!  these pants cost $600."
39869,homer,"yeah, it's about time.   oh."
39873,marge,"well, you can tell she's never had kids.  look how high"
39874,lisa,"granted, but you gotta admit constant supervision has been"
39875,homer,"well, that's a pretty big ""if,"" honey."
39876,bart," come on, dad, i gotta go to the bathroom."
39877,homer,"oh, i just got comfortable.  use the bottle.  [hands bart"
39878,marge,"no, i don't want you going in a bottle.  that's what"
39882,marge,"oh, jeez ... homer, just take him to the bathroom."
39883,homer, fine!  i don't even know why we have a bottle.
39884,bart,would you mind?  i'm trying to do my homework.
39885,homer,"uh, son, it's a little chilly.  maybe you should wrap a"
39886,marge,"oh, homey, no; we can't."
39887,homer,"well, what's the -- what's the big deal?  he sees a"
39888,marge,i don't want him to see us ... expressing our love.
39889,homer,why not?  kids are very visual these days.
39891,homer,"hey, hey, hey.  h-how about that, huh, huh?"
39893,homer,"but constance, it only happened because --"
39900,marge,"homer, no, we're not bad parents."
39902,marge,"no, i won't.  and frankly, judge, i think you're a bully."
39904,marge,"you're so busy thinking up crazy ways to punish people,"
39905,homer,"uh, your honor, i'd like to be tried separately."
39906,marge,"i don't mean to be disrespectful, judge harm, but we are"
39909,lisa,do you think it's fair that you're always getting
39911,lisa,"well, why don't you do something about it?"
39914,lisa,when are you going to start taking responsibility
39916,lisa,you're not even listening.
39917,bart,"i know you are, but what am i?"
39919,homer,"you know, we could get out of these stupid things if you"
39920,marge,"i just can't do that, homer.  it's a matter of principle,"
39921,homer,you're right.  it's time to stand up to that firm-breasted
39923,homer,"well, we tried all those other tools.  [gestures to a pile"
39926,homer,this address must be wrong.
39927,marge,"no.  no, there it is.  [points to a houseboat docked"
39928,homer,"she lives in a houseboat!?  wow, she's so cool!"
39930,homer,"i know, i know, fight the power."
39934,homer," look at her in there, washing"
39935,marge,"get away from that window, and help me with this banner."
39936,homer," i hate to call a judge dirty names, but there's"
39938,homer,so ... it cost you nothing.
39940,bart," your honor, may i say something?"
39944,bart,"your honor, it's not easy being my parents.  i'm always"
39947,bart,"so your honor, if you're going to punish anyone in this"
39955,lisa,"judge snyder, motion to declare a writ of ""boys will be"
39958,marge,"all right, we got lucky that time, but i want"
39963,marge,"hmmm, what's that noise?."
39964,homer,"uh, just the radio, dear.  "
39965,marge,"what are you reading, homey?"
39966,homer,"bridge column.   oh, that south -- you never know"
39967,lisa,where's bart?  his mountain dew's getting flat.
39968,marge,"  that's odd.  he's outside,"
39969,homer,probably digging for drugs.
39970,marge,there's no drugs out there.
39979,homer," oh!  hello, young man."
39981,homer,"yeah.  um, digging for anything in particular?"
39983,homer,"so, i guess you wouldn't mind if i was to dig a hole of my"
39994,homer,"yes.  eventually, i become king of the morlocks."
39999,homer,"oh, i just naturally assumed."
40001,homer,"jeez, moe, you've been a real crank lately."
40003,homer,"now you see, that's what i'm talking about.  you're always"
40007,homer,maybe we'd tip you if you'd smile once in a while.
40021,homer,"can do.  now, don't you worry about a thing.  [gleefully"
40023,homer,"no, moe, you've got it all wrong.  people buy beer from"
40028,bart,"uh, yeah, i'd like to speak with a mr. tabooger.  first"
40029,homer,"ooh, bart!  my first prank call!  what do i do?"
40030,bart,just ask if anyone knows ollie tabooger.
40032,bart,"yell out, ""i'll eat a booger."""
40050,homer,"and it would look pretty, too."
40055,homer,sorry.   he seems nice.
40057,homer,"wow, it looks like an alien headquarters.  couldn't you"
40061,homer,[looking at live rabbits wiggling in harnesses suspended
40069,homer,"uh, whatever, just give me a duff."
40071,homer,"uh, whatever.  just give me a duff."
40082,homer,"oh, so you're ashamed of us.  well, you turned into"
40086,homer,"i'll throw myself out, thank you."
40087,marge,running a bar is a full-time job -- and you don't even do
40088,homer,"well, when i'm passionate about something, i see it"
40110,homer,"'cause he's a big jerk and a she-male, too."
40113,marge,i thought this was gonna be your bar.
40114,homer,"it's a family bar, right kids?"
40116,homer,as soon as you finish cutting up those lemons.
40117,lisa,but you're not even using them.
40118,homer," she's so sweepy, she doesn't even know"
40122,homer,i told them it was a benefit.  they think they're saving
40125,homer,seems to me i already did.
40127,homer,bar?  i see no bar.  this is a hunting club.
40137,lisa,you don't like me?  i like you.
40140,lisa, how'd you get the bar back to normal so
40142,bart, like the ones found in your local yellow
40146,marge,"oh, i'm glad you two are friends again, so we can"
40147,homer,"hey, who invited the hippies?  "
40148,lisa,i did.  you owe r.e.m. an apology for eco-fraud.
40149,homer,"all right, i'm sorry.  but i will not save the"
40151,lisa,"and we can all be thankful to michael, peter, and"
40153,bart,i'm thankful i ate before i came.
40155,homer,"ah, and now to read my fortune.   ""geese can"
40157,homer,"well, i knew that before i came in here.  a guy"
40158,marge," ""every house has a bathroom."""
40159,homer,"aw, these fortunes are terrible."
40161,homer,these fortunes are terrible.  they're supposed to
40165,homer,you will be aroused by a shampoo commercial.
40170,homer,"okay, let's see ... um, the price of stamps will"
40173,homer,"let's see, ""you will invent a humorous toilet lid.""  ""you"
40195,marge,it's about time mr. burns found a woman.  i can't stand to
40196,lisa,"some people enjoy being alone, mom."
40197,marge,"no, everyone should be paired up.  [puts this into"
40215,homer,stop that dog!  it has my gum!
40217,homer," ah, ah, yes, mr. burns."
40221,homer,"oh!  yeah, monty's a wild man.  [high-fives mr. burns,"
40225,homer,"come on, he's a total player.  [kicks gloria's car's door"
40229,marge,"new underpants?  homer, what are you up to?"
40230,homer,burns wants me to come along on his date to show him where
40231,marge,"well, don't look too hip.  you don't want that girl"
40232,homer,you're right.  [rummages through the laundry hamper and
40237,homer,"yep, no one's rowdier or more youthful than old man burns."
40247,homer,you're going to ask her to marry you?
40249,homer,are you sure you want to do this so fast?
40253,homer,"oh, my god, oh, my god, oh, my god."
40274,homer,"wow, who do you have to kill to get a place like this?"
40277,homer,you know what would be surprising?  a foot massage.
40282,homer,"um, has the ship sailed on my foot-massage suggestion?"
40295,homer,"wow, mr. burns, how did you do that?"
40297,homer,what about the wiener?  a guy on tv lifted a can of paint
40304,bart,"you're preaching to the choir, man."
40311,bart,are you talking about a soul patch?
40314,lisa, i came home as quick as i could.
40315,marge,watch what happens when i spill this blue liquid.  [pours
40316,lisa,you pulled me out of school for this?
40317,marge,absolutely.  you're about to get a lesson -- in value.
40319,homer,"hey, you're looking at that spokesjack.  well, i can"
40327,marge, how did you get my number?
40328,homer,"i don't know, but i was quite moved by your letter.  i'd"
40330,homer,perfect.  i'll be there at seven.  
40331,marge,"oh, my god.  dinner with burly."
40333,homer,"i was having a private conversation with my wife, in the"
40334,homer,"so, how was your day?  did anything unbelievable happen?"
40335,marge,you're not going to believe it.  that paper towel
40336,homer,"tonight?  well, you'd better get your hopes up!"
40338,homer,"why look, it's chad sexington!  [opens the door.  barney"
40340,marge,barney?  wh -- where's chad?
40342,marge,i guess it was a pretty funny prank.  i like the ones
40343,homer,"yeah, nothing is hurt except feelings."
40356,homer, i am in your power.  boss me around.
40358,homer,look at me!  i'm a famous historian!  out of my way!
40360,homer,look at me!  i'm angie dickenson!  [runs around in
40361,bart,"oh, cool, he's still mental."
40363,marge,hmm.  how do we un-repress it?
40364,lisa,"well, the yaqui indians brew a special tea that unlocks"
40365,marge,it would be a good excuse to use my yaqui tea set.
40366,marge,well?  is anything coming back to you?
40367,homer,"ah, heh-heh.  there have been so many classic simpson"
40368,lisa," no, dad, everyone's sick of that memory."
40391,homer,"wait a minute.  i remember falling in the mud, but i don't"
40393,homer,something else happened in that quarry.  something ...
40394,marge,you found a corpse when you were twelve?  no wonder you've
40395,homer,it's responsible for everything wrong in my life.  my
40397,marge,maybe there's murder afoot.
40400,lisa,"you know, if dad never told anyone, that body must still"
40401,bart,this sounds like a case that only the simpson family can
40403,homer,"hey, you guys can come with us."
40405,marge,thanks for understanding.
40408,homer," yup, the old quarry is just a stone's throw"
40412,marge,maybe we should come back in the daytime.
40413,homer,someone's yellow belly is showing.
40415,lisa,"hey, what's that over there?"
40418,homer,and someone has eaten the flesh.  [looks accusingly at
40419,homer,"now do you believe dead rats float, lisa?"
40426,lisa, mr. smithers's father!
40439,homer, now the movie's turned into a play!
40445,marge,"homer, shouldn't we give that skull to mr. smithers?"
40446,homer,why?  he'd just bury it.
40448,marge,"sorry, we already solved it."
40450,homer,seems kind of pointless now.
40452,marge," let's see what you have, moe."
40454,marge,"wow, moe, you've been doing a lot of sleuthing."
40456,homer,did you really make that envelope?  'cause it says
40461,bart,"hey, lis, is dad's credit card number"
40465,bart,"uh, he didn't say, ""science.""  he said, ""pie pants."""
40467,homer,"the word ""un-blow-up-able"" is thrown around a lot"
40471,homer,i would really like to thank you nerds for helping me out.
40473,homer,"dweeb, wonk, spaz -- it's all good."
40474,marge,"oh, he's leaving her with five babies."
40477,marge,this is the worst thing you've ever done!
40478,homer,you say that so much it's lost all meaning.
40479,marge,fixing all that damage is going to be very
40482,marge,let's just write to david bowie again.
40495,lisa,what are they doing to the church?
40497,lisa,i feel like i want to throw up.
40504,homer," quiet, lisa!  everyone in the store is"
40505,lisa,"they should take a good look at themselves, and what"
40507,lisa,like the whore of babylon?
40509,lisa,"no, it's not.  it's apt.  apt!   don't"
40513,lisa,"those are all wonderful things, but they cost the"
40515,lisa,no.  i'm leaving this church forever!
40517,homer,i don't know how to feel.
40518,marge,you should be very upset.
40519,homer,got it.    how was that?
40522,lisa,"lord, i'm not turning my back on you.  i just need to find"
40523,marge, why do you have to be so different?  always
40524,lisa,"mom, i know it's you.  i can't believe you're"
40525,marge," oh, honey, i'm worried about your soul.  i"
40526,lisa,i still believe in god.  i just think there's another path
40527,marge,"her?!   she's just kidding, mr."
40528,bart,still looking for a new faith?
40530,bart,"hey, how about one of those religions where you eat a"
40533,lisa,"no!  look, i'm not just going to pick a religion that"
40534,bart,"how about judaism?  when you turn thirteen, cha-ching!"
40535,lisa,i'm going out for a walk.
40536,lisa,lenny and carl?  you guys are buddhist?
40538,lisa,"well, i'm looking for a new faith, one that isn't so"
40551,homer,"so, you think you know better than this family, huh?"
40553,lisa,"mom, dad, my spiritual quest is over."
40554,homer,"hold that thought.   bacon up that sausage, boy."
40555,bart,"dad, my heart hurts.   ohh.  [wraps a"
40557,homer,what?  that's it -- no more chat rooms for you!
40562,bart,i thought kearney was dating your mom.
40565,marge,"hey, lisa, what are you doing?"
40566,lisa,"i'm planting my own bodhi tree.  if i meditate under it,"
40567,marge,"honey, is this about some boy at school who doesn't like"
40569,marge,good.  i'm just saying that any boy who doesn't like you
40570,lisa, om mani padme hum.  om mani padme
40571,marge,oh -- you're going to get a bath tonight.
40573,marge,she's not a devil.  i just don't know what to do.
40576,marge,you think we can bribe her back with christmas?
40578,marge,"here she comes!  and-a one, and-a two, and-a ..."
40581,lisa,i just came down for a glass of water.
40582,marge,"oh.  well, you do have a present under the tree.  i"
40583,lisa,"well, santa can take it back, because i'm not ruled"
40584,homer,i don't know what santa left you.  i just know his
40585,marge,"lisa, we love you and we're not trying to put any"
40589,marge,"oh, no!  our daughter's run away on christmas eve!"
40593,lisa,my family tried to trick me into celebrating christmas!
40603,lisa,i can really celebrate christmas?
40605,lisa,"oh, i'll send you an e-mail greeting card."
40607,homer, i did it!  i found our
40608,marge,we were looking for lisa.
40609,bart,i thought we were caroling.
40611,lisa,"yeah, i wanted to spend christmas with you guys."
40612,homer,so you're back on the winning team?
40613,lisa,"no, i'm still buddhist, but i can worship with my family,"
40614,marge,so you're just going to pay lip service to our church?
40616,homer,that's all i ever asked.
40630,homer,quit trying to control me.
40631,marge,we don't need tv to have family fun.  why don't we play
40633,marge,let's stick to original monopoly.  the game's crazy enough
40635,homer,i'm good for the rest -- you know i am!
40636,bart,"well, i'd like to trust you, homer, but you've been in"
40637,homer,they told me it would be like this on the outside.
40638,lisa, these hotels are made of
40639,marge,"lisa, it was probably an accident."
40640,lisa,"oh, sure, you take his side, just because he bought you"
40641,bart,who else is going to take care of her?  dad?
40644,lisa,"mom, that's not how you pry them apart!  [grabs bart's arm"
40645,marge,i've been prying them apart since before you were born!
40652,lisa,"thanks a lot, everybody.  now, i'll never get into an ivy"
40653,bart," you're going to stanford, you're going to"
40655,lisa,take it back!  take it back!
40657,marge,this family has hit rock bottom.
40659,homer, a heavenly choir!  you must be an angel.
40661,homer,"no, you are an angel, like denzel washington in ""the"
40662,marge,"sir, we know you're not an angel.  my husband sees"
40663,homer,don't blame me -- blame tinseltown and its second
40664,bart,"attention, everyone!  this is gabriel, my personal"
40667,marge,"food keeps my family happy, so i make a few practice"
40668,homer,"okay, gabriel, this is a bar.  it's where i go to"
40670,homer,pfft.  well not with that temper.
40672,homer,"okay, why are we in the woods?  is this heaven?"
40676,homer,which is society's fault because ...
40683,bart,but how are we supposed to get it?
40685,homer,"cooperate?  well, this is one family that doesn't"
40690,marge,we've got to do something -- but what?
40692,lisa,"look, we can't fall into old patterns.  we've got to think"
40693,homer,"okay, but talk like this."
40694,lisa," fine, i'll talk like this."
40696,lisa,"dad's on the log.  now mom, you get the car and pull them"
40697,marge,"oh, my driving ankle!  bart, i know this sounds crazy, but"
40698,bart," okay, but it's my first time."
40700,bart,i got a set.  [walks to the car and laces up a pair of
40701,homer,"oh, no!  the roast beef is making them stronger --"
40703,homer,"no!  i will never --  oh, wait,"
40705,bart,our bitter fights are now history!
40707,homer,wolves and cougars ate our roast beef!
40708,marge,"you know, we've been through some 280 adventures together,"
40709,homer,"yep, our family is as functional as all get-out."
40710,lisa,could this be the end of our series ... of events?
40713,homer,"oh, it's the woman i married in vegas!"
40721,homer,"so, sitting on the bed, eh?"
40723,homer,"look, i married her, but that is as far as we went.  we"
40724,marge,"homer, i don't know if i can ever forgive you.  please go"
40725,homer,"fair enough, but i'm going to come back with the greatest"
40730,homer,"please, just leave me alone."
40732,homer," ooh!  yeah.  that's good ... oh, don't stop ..."
40733,marge,"oh, no, she's making him a sandwich.  [covers her ears"
40749,homer,marge?  you're speaking to me?
40750,marge,"why don't you come inside, and we'll talk."
40751,homer,talk about what?  sports?  bigamy?
40754,homer,"my lady's glass is empty, moe.  bring her another"
40757,homer,"you know, she can put that mole anywhere on her face."
40766,marge,"i'm so proud of us.  when we stick together, we can do"
40771,homer,"a library selling books?  if i don't want 'em for free,"
40772,marge,why do you always wait until we arrive to complain?
40775,bart,why would duff beer put out a book?
40776,lisa,it was originally published to settle arguments in
40777,homer,"she said, ""tavern!""  i'm going to moe's.  "
40778,marge, i never agreed to that rule!
40783,homer,"peace, my brothers.  all shall be looked up."
40789,homer,i'm here to break a world's record.  what's the
40791,homer,fine.  i'll just play the banjo with this cobra.
40795,homer,"yeah, they're called congress.  "
40807,homer,"woo-hoo!  in your face, milwaukee!"
40808,marge, look at all these empty
40810,marge,"oh.  apu, everything in this store is overloaded"
40815,marge,"well, i'm going to have a talk with them.  where are"
40818,marge,"excuse me, i'm looking for the head of motherloving sugar."
40820,marge,"i'm marge simpson, long-time customer, first-time"
40822,marge,i want you to stop putting so much sugar into everything.
40824,marge,don't you have any sense of corporate responsibility?
40828,marge,"but we're on hiatus, everyone's everywhere."
40831,marge,"if you looked up ""meany-beany-fo-feenie"" in the"
40832,homer,wait -- you went to a sugar factory?  were there oompa-
40833,marge,"there was one in a cage, but he wasn't moving."
40835,marge,"that company's ruining the whole town's health, and i"
40836,lisa,why don't you file a class-action suit?
40837,marge,"oh, yeah, like erin brockovich."
40838,bart,the prostitute with a heart of gold.
40843,homer,"well, well, if it isn't the woman who's too busy saving"
40844,marge,what are you talking about?   is that
40845,homer,"[lifts the lid, revealing a meatloaf that's burned to a"
40846,marge,why didn't you just turn off the oven?
40847,homer,"i was hoping we could do that together.  [runs out,"
40873,homer," thank you, erin choco-snitch.  that was a group"
40874,marge,i'm just trying to make this a healthier place to live.
40875,homer,"well, good work blue hair and brocko-witch.  [everyone"
40879,homer, nothing left ... nothing left.
40883,homer,count fudgula?  i thought you wanted to get off the stuff.
40885,lisa,is it really worth risking your lives just for some sugar?
40886,marge, dessert's on!  i steamed some limes!
40889,bart, i think he's grossed out by
40890,homer," ew, i touched it.  over."
40892,homer,"kinda.   c'mon, give it!"
40894,homer, that wasn't part of the deal.
40896,homer,remember what i told you about running away from your
40900,homer,"before i bring the sugar in, i want to see the oompa-"
40905,homer,"ooh, they both make good arguments."
40908,marge,everybody looks so happy.
40910,lisa,"can we, mom, can we?  please, please, please?"
40911,marge,"oh, all right.  but take maggie with you.  [hands maggie"
40912,homer,"no, marge, i love when you do that.  you're a regular"
40913,marge,"oh, that's the best one."
40914,homer,that's what i told lisa!
40917,lisa,you do this every year!  we are used to it.
40922,marge,wouldn't it be great if that man and woman got
40923,lisa,these are so easy.  it's obviously tom hanks.
40931,homer, i'm laughing ... but it's a laugh of
40938,homer, stop the madness!  start the movie!
40939,lisa,maybe we should try to calm dad down.
40940,bart,"i prefer to egg him on.   hey dad, has the movie"
40942,marge,"homer, you're going to get into trouble."
40943,homer,i'm not scared of those ushers.  what are they going
40947,homer,"my mouth, my beautiful mouth!"
40950,marge," ""so your life is ruined.""  [grumbles, then"
40951,homer,"[semi-articulate, since he obviously can't open his"
40954,bart,"hey, dad, i'm going to make a human yo-yo.  if you"
