30,Elizabeth,"Yes, yes!\"
32,Elizabeth,"Oh, it?s beautiful!\"
34,Elizabeth,May I inquire as to the occasion?\
36,Elizabeth,The ceremony?\
38,Elizabeth,I knew it!\
40,Elizabeth,It?s difficult to say.\
42,Elizabeth,"Well, women in London must?ve learned not to breathe.\"
45,Will,"Good day, sir. I have your order. \"
47,Will,The blade is folded steel. That?s gold filigree laid into the handle. If I may. \
49,Will,I shall. A craftsman is always pleased to hear his work is appreciated.\
51,Elizabeth,Will! It?s so good to see you. I had a dream about you last night.\
52,Will,About me?\
54,Elizabeth,"About the day we met, do you remember?\"
55,Will,"How could I forget, Miss Swann&#160;?\"
56,Elizabeth,"Will, how many times must I ask you to call me Elizabeth&#160;?\"
57,Will,"At least once more, Miss Swann , as always.\"
59,Elizabeth,"Good day, Mr. Turner .\"
61,Will,Good day? &#160;? Elizabeth .\
64,Jack,What d?ye say to three shillings? and we forget the name?\
67,Jack,I?m terribly sorry. I
69,Jack,It?s a fine goal - to be sure -  but it seems to me that a?  makes this one
71,Jack,"I?ve heard of one, supposed to be very fast&#160;? nigh un-catchable?... the Black Pearl.\"
89,Jack,"I?m sorry, it?s just - it?s such a pretty boat."
91,Jack,"Smith. Or Smithy, if you like.\"
94,Jack,"Well, then, I confess, it is my intention to commandeer one of these ships, pick up a crew in Tortuga,  raid, pillage, plunder and otherwise pilfer my weasely black guts out!\"
98,Jack,"Unless, of course, he knew you wouldn?t believe the truth even if he told it to you.\"
99,Elizabeth,I can?t breathe.\
102,Jack,&#160;?and then they made me their chief.\
105,Jack,Will you be saving her then?\
107,Jack,\
109,Jack,Move! \
111,Jack,Clearly you?ve never been to Singapore .  Where did you get that?\
114,Elizabeth,"Yes, I?m fine.\"
116,Elizabeth,"Father! Commodore, do you really intend to kill my rescuer? \"
120,Jack,"Captain Jack Sparrow , if you please, sir.\"
122,Jack,I?m in the market as it were.\
126,Jack,But you have heard of me. \
127,Elizabeth,"Commodore, I really must protest.\"
129,Elizabeth,Pirate or not this man saved my life.\
131,Jack,Though it seems enough to condemn him.\
133,Jack,Finally. \
135,Jack,"I knew you?d warm up to me. Commodore Norrington, my effects, please, and my hat. Commodore! Elizabeth . It is Elizabeth isn?t it?\"
136,Elizabeth,It?s Miss Swann .\
137,Jack,"Miss Swann , if you?d be so kind. Come, come, dear. We don?t have all day. Now if you?d be very kind.  Easy on the goods, darling.\"
138,Elizabeth,You?re despicable.\
139,Jack,"Sticks and stones, love. I saved your life, you save mine, we?re square. Gentlemen, m?lady, you will always remember this as the day that you almost caught Captain Jack Sparrow&#160;! \"
144,Jack,\
145,Will,You're the one they're hunting. The pirate.\
146,Jack,You seem somewhat familiar. Have I threatened you before?\
147,Will,I make a point of avoiding familiarity with pirates.\
148,Jack,"Ah, well, then it would be a shame to put a black mark on your record. So, if you'll excuse me?  Do you think this wise, boy&#160;? crossing blades with a pirate?\"
149,Will,You threatened Miss Swann .\
150,Jack,Only a little. \
151,Will,I do! And I practice with them? three hours a day!\
152,Jack,"You need to find yourself a girl, mate! Or perhaps the reason you practice three hours a day is that you already found one and are otherwise incapable of wooing said strumpet. You're not a eunuch, are you? \"
153,Will,"I practice three hours a day so that when I meet a pirate, I can kill it!  You cheated!\"
154,Jack,Pirate!  Move away.\
155,Will,No.\
156,Jack,
157,Will,No! I
158,Jack,This shot is
165,Jack,"You can keep doing that forever, the dog is never going to move.\"
167,Elizabeth,"I suspected Commodore Norrington would propose but I must admit, I wasn?t entirely prepared for it.\"
169,Elizabeth,"Oh, yes, it was terrifying.\"
171,Elizabeth,It is a smart match. He?s a fine man; he?s what any woman should dream of marrying.\
173,Elizabeth,That is too bold.\
182,Jack,"No survivors? Then where do the stories come from, I wonder?\"
188,Elizabeth,What?\
190,Elizabeth,"They haven?t seen you. Hide, and the first chance you get, run to the fort. \"
197,Elizabeth,Parley!\
199,Elizabeth,"Parley. I invoke the right of parley. According to the Code of the brethren, set down by the pirates Morgan and Bartholomew , you have to take me to your Captain.\"
201,Elizabeth,If an adversary demands parley you can do them no harm until the parley is complete.\
204,Will,Goodbye.\
206,Elizabeth,Will.\
207,Will,\
210,Jack,\
214,Jack,"Worry about your own fortunes, gentlemen. The deepest circle of Hell is reserved for betrayers and mutineers.  So there is a curse. That?s interesting.\"
216,Jack,That?s very interesting.\
219,Elizabeth,I am here to negotiate&#160;? \
224,Elizabeth,"Captain Barbossa , I am here to negotiate the cessation of hostilities against Port Royal .\"
226,Elizabeth,I want you to leave and never come back.\
228,Elizabeth,Very well. I?ll drop it. \
230,Elizabeth,It?s what you?ve been searching for. I recognized the ship. I saw it eight years ago on the crossing from England .\
232,Elizabeth,"Fine. Well, I suppose if it is worthless then there?s no point in me keeping it. \"
234,Elizabeth,Elizabeth&#160;?Turner. I?m a maid in the Governor?s household.  \
238,Elizabeth,"I didn?t steal it, if that?s what you mean.\"
240,Elizabeth,\
242,Elizabeth,Wait! You have to take me to shore. According to the Code of the Order of the Brethren -\
245,Will,They?ve taken her. They?ve taken Elizabeth .\
247,Will,We
251,Will,Ask him where it is. Make a deal with him. He could lead us to it.\
253,Will,That?s
255,Will,You. Sparrow!\
256,Jack,Aye.\
257,Will,You are familiar with that ship&#160;? the Black Pearl?\
258,Jack,I?ve
259,Will,Where does it make berth?\
260,Jack,
261,Will,The ship?s real enough. Therefore its anchorage must be a real place. Where is it?\
262,Jack,Why ask
263,Will,Because you?re a pirate.\
264,Jack,And
265,Will,Never!  They took Miss Swann .\
266,Jack,"Oh, so it is that you?ve found a girl. I see. Well, if you?re intending to brave all, hasten to her rescue and so win fair lady?s heart you?ll have to do it alone, mate. I see"
267,Will,I can get you out of here.\
268,Jack,How?s that? The key?s run off.\
269,Will,I helped build these cells. These are half pin-barrel hinges.  With the right leverage and the proper application of strength? the door will lift free.\
270,Jack,What?s your name?\
271,Will,Will Turner .\
272,Jack,"That will be short for William , I imagine. Good, strong name. No doubt, named for your father, eh?\"
273,Will,Yes.\
274,Jack,"Uh-huh. Well, Mr. Turner , I?ve changed me mind. If you spring me from this cell I swear on pain of death I shall take you to the Black Pearl and your bonny lass. Do we have an accord?\"
275,Will,Agreed.\
276,Jack,Agreed. Get me out.\
277,Will,Hurry. Someone will have heard that.\
278,Jack,Not without my effects.\
280,Will,We?re going to steal the ship. That ship? \
281,Jack,"Commandeer. We?re going to commandeer that ship. Nautical term. One question about your business, boy, or there?s no use going. This girl&#160;? how far are you willing to go to save her?\"
282,Will,I?d die for her.\
283,Jack,"Oh, good. No worries, then.\"
284,Will,This is either madness or brilliance.\
285,Jack,It?s remarkable how often those two traits coincide.  Everyone stay calm! we are taking over the ship.\
286,Will,Aye! Avast! \
288,Jack,Son?I?m Captain Jack Sparrow. Savvy?\
292,Will,Here they come.\
296,Jack,"Thank you, Commodore, for getting us ready to make way. We?d have had a hard time of it by ourselves.\"
307,Will,"When I was a lad living in England , my mother raised me by herself. After she died, I came out here, looking for my father.\"
308,Jack,Is that so?\
309,Will,"My father, Will Turner . At the jail, it was only after you learned my name that you agreed to help. Since that?s what I wanted, I didn?t press the matter. I?m not a simpleton, Jack. You knew my father.\"
310,Jack,I knew&#160;?im. Probably one the few who knew him as William Turner . Everyone else just called him Bootstrap or Bootstrap Bill.\
311,Will,Bootstrap?\
312,Jack,Good man. Good pirate. I swear you look just like him.\
313,Will,"It?s not true. He was a merchant sailor. A good, respectable man who obeyed the law.\"
314,Jack,"He was a bloody pirate, a scallywag.\"
315,Will,My father was not a pirate. \
316,Jack,"Put it away, son. It?s not worth you getting beat again.\"
317,Will,"You didn?t beat me. you ignored the rules of engagement. In a fair fight, I?d killed you.\"
318,Jack,"Then that's not much incentive for me to fight fair, then, is it?   can you sail under the command of a pirate? Or can you not?\"
319,Will,Tortuga&#160;?\
320,Jack,"Tortuga .  More importantly, it is indeed a sad life that has never breathed deep this sweet, proliferous bouquet that is Tortuga , savvy? What do you think?\"
321,Will,It'll linger.\
322,Jack,"I?ll tell you mate, if every town in the world were like this one, no man would ever feel unwanted.\"
323,Jack,Scarlett&#160;!  Not sure I deserved that. Giselle! \
325,Jack,What?  I may have deserved that. \
328,Jack,"Ah, fortunately I know how to counter it. The man who did the waking buys, the man who was sleeping, a drink. The man who was sleeping drinks it while listening to a proposition from the man who did the waking.\"
330,Will,That was for the smell.\
331,Jack,\
333,Jack,"I?m going after the Black Pearl.  I know where it?s going to be, and I?m going to take it.\"
335,Jack,That?s why I know what Barbossa is up to. All I need is a crew.\
337,Jack,"Well, then I?d say it?s a very good thing I?m not a fool then, eh?\"
339,Jack,"Let?s just say it?s a matter of leverage, eh? \"
341,Jack,"That is the child of Bootstrap Bill Turner. His only child, savvy?\"
343,Jack,One can only hope. Take what you can? \
347,Elizabeth,"Well, you may tell the captain that I am disinclined to acquiesce to his request.\"
349,Elizabeth,It?s poisoned.\
351,Elizabeth,"Then release me, you have your trinket; I?m of no further value to you.\"
353,Elizabeth,It?s a pirate medallion.\
355,Elizabeth,"I hardly believe in ghost stories anymore, Captain Barbossa .\"
357,Elizabeth,And the blood to be repaid?\
362,Will,So this is your able-bodied crew?\
363,Jack,"You, sailor!\"
365,Jack,"Mr. Cotton&#160;? do you have the courage and fortitude to follow orders and stay true in the face of danger and almost certain death? Mr. Cotton&#160;! Answer, man!\"
367,Jack,Mr. Cotton 's... parrot. Same question.\
370,Jack,O?course it does.  Satisfied?\
371,Will,"Well, you?ve proved they?re mad.\"
373,Jack,\
374,Will,I suppose you didn?t deserve that one either.\
375,Jack,"No, that one I deserved.\"
377,Jack,Actually -  borrowed. Borrowed without permission. But with every intention of bringing it back to you.\
379,Jack,You?ll get another one.\
381,Will,A better one.\
382,Jack,A better one!\
383,Will,That one. \
384,Jack,"What one? That one?! Aye, that one. What say you?\"
388,Jack,It?d be far worse not to have her.\
389,Will,How can we sail to an island that nobody can find with a compass that doesn?t work?\
391,Jack,She can hold a bit longer.\
393,Jack,We?re catching up.\
397,Will,How is it that Jack came by that compass?\
399,Will,What? He failed to mention that.\
401,Will,Ah. So that's the reason for all the?  \
403,Will,Barbossa.\
405,Will,How did Jack get off the island?\
407,Will,He roped a couple of sea turtles?\
409,Will,What did he use for rope?\
410,Jack,Human hair?from my back. Let go of the anchor!\
412,Jack,Young Mr. Turner and I are to go ashore.\
414,Jack,Keep to the code.\
422,Jack,Pirate?s Code. Any man that falls behind?is left behind.\
423,Will,"No heroes amongst thieves, eh?\"
424,Jack,"You know, for having such a bleak outlook on pirates you?re well on your way to becoming one. Sprung a man from jail, commandeered a ship of the Fleet, sailed with a buccaneer crew out of Tortuga &#160;?and you?re completely obsessed with treasure.\"
425,Will,That?s not true. I am not obsessed with treasure.\
426,Jack,"Not all treasure is silver and gold, mate.\"
428,Will,Elizabeth .\
432,Will,Jack&#160;!\
433,Jack,Not yet. We wait for the opportune moment.\
435,Will,When?s that? When it?s of greatest profit to you?\
436,Jack,"May I ask you something? Have I ever given you reason not to trust me? Do us a favor&#160;? I know it?s difficult for you, but please stay here and try not to do anything stupid.\"
442,Will,"Sorry, Jack . I?m not going to be your leverage.\"
443,Elizabeth,That?s it?\
453,Elizabeth,No.\
470,Jack,"Am I not?  Palulay?palu-li-la-la-lulu, parlili? parsnip, pasley, par -  partner, partner?\"
472,Jack,Parley! That?s the one. Parley! Parley!\
474,Jack,That would be the French.\
476,Elizabeth,Not more pirates.\
478,Elizabeth,Mr. Gibbs&#160;?\
480,Elizabeth,Jack&#160;? Jack Sparrow&#160;?\
481,Will,He fell behind. \
485,Jack,"When you marooned me on that godforsaken spit of land, you forgot one very important thing, mate. I?m Captain Jack Sparrow .\"
487,Jack,"The girl?s blood didn?t work, did it?\"
489,Jack,I know whose blood ye need.\
490,Will,Pirate. Here. Let me. \
491,Elizabeth,Thank you.\
492,Will,You said you gave Barbossa my name as yours. Why?\
493,Elizabeth,I don?t know. \
494,Will,I?m sorry. Blacksmith?s hands - I know they?re rough.\
495,Elizabeth,"No?I mean yes, they are but? but don?t stop.\"
496,Will,Elizabeth .\
497,Elizabeth,It?s yours.\
498,Will,I thought I?d lost it the day they rescued me. It was a gift from my father. He sent it to me. Why did you take it?\
499,Elizabeth,Because I was afraid that you were a pirate. That would have been awful.\
500,Will,It wasn?t your blood they needed. It was my father?s blood?my blood?the blood of a pirate.\
501,Elizabeth,"Will, I?m so sorry, please forgive me. \"
503,Jack,"No. I expect to leave you standing on some beach with absolutely no name at all, watching me sail away on my ship and then I?ll shout the name back to you. Savvy?\"
505,Jack,"Of the two of us, I am the only one who hasn't committed mutiny, therefore?my word is the one we'll be trusting. Although?I suppose I should be thanking you because, in fact, if you hadn?t betrayed me and left me to die, I would have an equal share in that curse, same as you. \"
507,Jack,"I?m having a thought here, Barbossa. What say we run up a flag of truce? I scurry over to the Interceptor, and I negotiate the return of your medallion, eh? What say you to that?\"
511,Elizabeth,What?s happening?\
513,Elizabeth,This is the fastest ship in the Caribbean .\
515,Elizabeth,"We?re shallow on the draft, right?\"
517,Elizabeth,"Well, then can't we lose them amongst those shoals?\"
523,Will,Gibbs&#160;! We have to make a stand. We must fight! Load the guns!\
525,Will,Anything. Everything! Anything we have left.\
527,Elizabeth,Lower the anchor on the right side. On the starboard side!\
528,Will,It certainly has the element of surprise.\
531,Elizabeth,\
534,Will,Keep us steady now. Now!\
536,Elizabeth,Fire all! \
537,Jack,\
539,Elizabeth,Your turn.\
542,Will,She?s not what they?re after.\
543,Elizabeth,\
545,Will,Hey! Hey! Below!\
546,Jack,\
548,Jack,That?s not very nice. Where?s the medallion?\
549,Elizabeth,Wretch! \
550,Jack,Ahh. Where?s dear William&#160;?\
551,Elizabeth,Will&#160;?  Will!\
552,Will,Elizabeth&#160;!\
553,Jack,\
554,Elizabeth,I can?t move it.  Will!\
555,Will,Elizabeth&#160;!\
557,Jack,You?re welcome.\
561,Elizabeth,You?ve got to stop it! Stop it!\
563,Will,Barbossa!\
564,Elizabeth,Will.\
565,Will,She goes free. \
567,Will,She goes free!\
569,Jack,Don?t do anything stupid.\
570,Will,You can?t. I can. \
571,Jack,Like that.\
573,Jack,"No one. He?s no one. A distant cousin of my aunt?s nephew twice removed. Lovely singing voice, though&#160;? eunuch.\"
574,Will,My name is Will Turner . My father was Bootstrap Bill Turner. His blood runs in my veins.\
576,Will,"On my word do as I say, or I?ll pull this trigger and be lost to Davy Jones? Locker.\"
578,Will,Elizabeth goes free.\
580,Will,And the crew&#160;? the crew are not to be harmed.\
583,Will,"Barbossa, you lying bastard! You swore she?d go free!\"
587,Jack,I always liked you.\
588,Elizabeth,It goes with your black heart. \
592,Jack,I?d really rather hoped we were past all this.\
594,Jack,I did notice.\
596,Jack,"Last time, you left me a pistol with one shot.\"
598,Jack,"Seeing as there?s two of us, a gentleman?would give us a pair of pistols.\"
601,Jack,That?s the second time I?ve had to watch that man sail away with my ship.\
602,Elizabeth,"But you were marooned on this island before, weren?t you? So we can escape in the same way you did then.\"
603,Jack,"To what point and purpose, young missy? The Black Pearl is gone and unless you have a rudder and a lot of sails hidden in that bodice&#160;? unlikely - young Mr. Turner will be dead long before you can reach him.\"
604,Elizabeth,But you?re Captain Jack Sparrow . You vanished from under the eyes of seven agents of the East India Company. You sacked Nassau Port without even firing a shot. Are you the pirate I?ve read about or not? How did you escape last time?\
605,Jack,"Last time?I was here a grand total of three days, all right? Last time \"
606,Elizabeth,"So that?s it then? That?s the secret grand adventure of the infamous Jack Sparrow&#160;? You spent three days lying on a beach, drinking rum?!\"
607,Jack,"Welcome to the Caribbean , love. \"
609,Jack,"I love this song! Really bad eggs! Ooh.  When I get the Pearl back, I?m gonna teach it to the whole crew, and we?ll sing it all the time!\"
610,Elizabeth,And you?ll be positively the most fearsome pirate in the Spanish Main .\
611,Jack,"Not just the Spanish Main , love. The entire ocean. The entire wo?ld. Wherever we want to go, we?ll go. That?s what a ship is, you know. It?s not just a keel and a hull and a deck and sails that's what a ship needs but what a ship is?what the Black Pearl really is?is freedom.\"
612,Elizabeth,Jack&#160;?it must be really terrible for you to be trapped on this island.\
613,Jack,"Oh, yes.  But the company is infinitely better than last time, I think. The scenery has definitely improved.\"
614,Elizabeth,Mr. Sparrow&#160;?I?m not entirely sure that I?ve had enough rum to allow that kind of talk.\
615,Jack,"I know exactly what you mean, love. \"
616,Elizabeth,To freedom.\
617,Jack,"To the Black Pearl .  No! Not good! Stop! Not good! What are you doing? You burned all the food, the shade! The rum!\"
618,Elizabeth,"Yes, the rum is gone.\"
619,Jack,Why is the rum gone?\
620,Elizabeth,"One, because it is a vile drink that turns even the most respectable men into complete scoundrels. Two, that signal is over a thousand feet high. The entire Royal Navy is out looking for me, do you really think that there is even the slightest chance that they won?t see it?\"
621,Jack,But why is the rum gone?\
622,Elizabeth,"Just wait, Captain Sparrow. You give it one hour, maybe two, keep a weather eye out and then you will see white sails on that horizon.\"
623,Jack,There?ll be no living with her after this.\
625,Elizabeth,But we?ve got to save Will .\
627,Elizabeth,Then we condemn him to death.\
629,Elizabeth,To rescue me. To prevent anything from happening to me.\
630,Jack,"If I may be so bold as to inject my professional opinion. The Pearl was listing near to scuppers after the battle. It?s very unlikely she?ll be able to make good time. Think about it. The Black Pearl . The last real pirate threat in the Caribbean , mate. How can you pass that up?\"
632,Elizabeth,"Commodore, I beg you, please do this. For me. As a wedding gift.\"
634,Elizabeth,I am.\
635,Jack,"A wedding! I love weddings?drinks all around!  I know.&#160;?Clap him in irons,? right?\"
637,Jack,Inescapably clear.\
640,Will,You knew William Turner&#160;?\
652,Jack,"Not if you?re the one doing the ambushing. I go in, I convince Barbossa to send his men out with their little boats. You and your mates return to the Dauntless and blast the bejesus outta them with your little cannons, eh?  What do you have to lose?\"
654,Jack,"Now, to be quite honest with you, there?s still a slight risk for those aboard the Dauntless which includes the future Mrs. Commodore .\"
655,Elizabeth,Coward! The commodore ordered&#160;? I have to tell him! The pirates! They?re cursed! They cannot be killed!\
657,Elizabeth,This is Jack Sparrow&#160;?s doing! \
661,Jack,Beg your pardon.\
663,Jack,Excuse me.\
665,Will,Jack&#160;!\
667,Jack,Not probable.\
668,Will,Where?s Elizabeth&#160;?\
669,Jack,"She?s safe, just like I promised. She's all set to marry Norrington, just like she promised. And you get to die for her, just like you promised. So we're all men of our word really except for Elizabeth who is, in fact, a woman.\"
671,Jack,"You don?t want to be doing that, mate.\"
673,Jack,Your funeral.\
675,Jack,"Well, because &#160;?because the HMS Dauntless, pride of the Royal Navy, is floating just offshore. Waiting for you.\"
681,Jack,"Just hear me out, mate. You order your men to row out to the Dauntless. They do what they do best. Robert&#160;?s your Uncle, Fannie&#160;?s your Aunt, there you are with two ships. The makings of your very own fleet.&#160;?Course you?ll take the grandest as your flagship, and who?s to argue? But what of the Pearl&#160;? Name me Captain, I?ll sail under your colors, I?ll give you ten percent of me plunder and you get to introduce yourself as?Commodore Barbossa. Savvy?\"
683,Jack,"No, no, not at all by all means, kill the whelp. Just not yet. Wait to lift the curse until the opportune moment. For instance? \"
684,Will,You?ve been planning this from the beginning. Ever since you learned my name.\
685,Jack,Yeah.\
687,Jack,Fifteen.\
689,Jack,Twenty-five. And I?ll buy you the hat. A really big one?Commodore.\
691,Jack,All hand?s to the boats!  Apologies. You give the orders.\
693,Jack,Not to the boats? \
704,Jack,"Me? I'm dishonest. And a dishonest man you can always trust to be dishonest. Honestly. It's the honest ones you want to watch out for, because you can never predict when they're going to do something incredibly? stupid. \"
710,Jack,Sorry.\
712,Jack,Or you could surrender.\
716,Elizabeth,"And what about Jack , you?re just going to leave him?\"
719,Elizabeth,"The code? You?re pirates. Hang the code, and hang the rules! They?re more like guidelines anyway.  Bloody pirates.\"
726,Elizabeth,Whose side is Jack on?\
727,Will,At the moment? \
729,Jack,\
731,Will,He didn?t waste it. \
735,Elizabeth,We should return to the Dauntless.\
736,Will,Your fianc� will be wanting to know you?re safe. \
737,Jack,"If you were waiting for the opportune moment?that was it. Now, if you?ll be so kind, I?d be much obliged if you?d drop me off my ship.\"
738,Elizabeth,"I?m sorry, Jack.\"
739,Jack,They done what?s right by them. Can?t expect more than that.\
742,Jack,"Captain, Captain Jack Sparrow .\"
744,Elizabeth,This is wrong.\
747,Jack,\
749,Will,\
750,Elizabeth,\
752,Will,Move! \
755,Will,"And a good man.  If all I have achieved here is that the hangman will earn two pairs of boots instead of one, so be it. At least my conscience will be clear.\"
757,Will,It?s right here?between you and Jack .\
758,Elizabeth,As is mine.\
761,Elizabeth,It is.\
762,Jack,\
768,Will,I will accept the consequences of my actions.\
770,Will,Thank you.\
774,Elizabeth,No. \
775,Jack,I thought you were supposed to keep to the Code.\
777,Jack,Thank you.\
779,Jack,"And really bad eggs?drink up, me 'earties, yo ho.\"
781,Elizabeth,Will. Why is this happening?
782,Will,I don’t know.  You look beautiful.
783,Elizabeth,I think it’s bad luck for the groom to see the bride before the wedding.
793,Elizabeth,On what charges?!
794,Will,No!
796,Elizabeth,What are the charges?
799,Will,"Lord Beckett, in the category of questions not answered –"
800,Elizabeth,We are under the jurisdiction of the King’s governor of Port Royal and you Will tell us what we are charged with.
804,Elizabeth,Captain Jack Sparrow.
807,Jack,Do you mind if we make a little side trip? I didn’t think so.
809,Jack,"Complications arose, ensued, were overcome."
811,Jack,Muhuh.
816,Jack,Shiny?
818,Jack,"Is that how you’re all feeling, then? Perhaps dear ol’ Jack is not serving your best interests as Captain?"
820,Jack,What did the bird say?!
823,Jack,It does me.
825,Jack,"Gentlemen, what do keys do?"
828,Jack,"No.  We don’t have the key, we can’t open whatever it is we don’t have that it unlocks. So, what purpose would be served in finding whatever need be unlocked, which we don’t have, without first having found the key what unlocks it."
830,Jack,You’re not making any sense at all.  Any more questions?
832,Jack,Ah!  that way direction!
834,Jack,"Come on. Snap to and make sail, you know how this works. Oi, oi!"
840,Will,More acquaintance than friend. How do you know him?
842,Will,What mark did he leave on you?
844,Will,Recover. At the point of a sword?
846,Will,Somehow I doubt Jack Will consider employment the same as being free.
848,Will,So you get both Jack and the Black Pearl.
850,Will,The property you want that he possesses.
852,Jack,
854,Jack,Bootstrap. Bill Turner?
856,Jack,Is this a dream?
858,Jack,"I thought not, if it were, there’d be rum."
860,Jack,"I had some help retrieving the Pearl, by the way. Your son."
862,Jack,And to what do I owe the pleasure of your carbuncle?
864,Jack,"Ah. So it’s you, then. He shanghaied you into service, eh?"
866,Jack,It’s funny what a man Will do to forestall his final judgment.
868,Jack,"Technically, I –"
870,Jack,"Yes, but The Flying Dutchman already has a Captain, so there’s really –"
872,Jack,Any idea when Jones might release said terrible beastie?
874,Jack,
876,Jack,"I want a—- , plenty running. Run as if the devil himself and itself was upon us!"
878,Jack,Ah!
880,Jack,"I didn’t say port. I said land, any land."
882,Jack,"No, no, leave it."
884,Jack,Shh!
886,Jack,Nothing.
892,Elizabeth,Jack’s compass? What does Beckett want with that?
893,Will,Doesn’t matter. I’m to find Jack and convince him to return to Port Royal and in exchange the charges against us Will be dropped.
895,Will,Is that a lack of faith in Jack… or in me?
897,Elizabeth,I have faith in you. Both of you. Where Will you find him?
898,Will,Tortuga. I’ll start there and I won’t stop searching ‘till I find him. And then I intend to return here to marry you.
899,Elizabeth,Properly?
900,Will,"With your leave, if you’ll still have me."
901,Elizabeth,"If it weren’t for these bars, I’d have you already.  I’ll wait for you."
902,Will,Keep a weather eye on the horizon.
910,Will,"What’s wrong, the beach is right there?"
912,Will,What?
914,Will,"Ah, a familiar face."
916,Will,I’m not going to eat you.
918,Will,
920,Will,"Jack, it’s me, Will Turner!"
921,Jack,Pah se ko?
923,Will,Tell them to let me down.
924,Jack,
926,Will,"Jack, the compass, it’s all I need. Elizabeth is in danger. We were arrested for trying to help you. She faces the gallows!"
927,Jack,
929,Jack,Save me.
930,Will,"Jack, what did you tell them? No! What about Elizabeth? Jaaack!"
934,Elizabeth,You’ve got to tell me what’s happening.
936,Elizabeth,No! Will’s gone to find Jack!
938,Elizabeth,He’s a better man than you give him credit for.
940,Elizabeth,A fair trial for Will ends in a hanging.
947,Elizabeth,Then what is?
949,Elizabeth,I expect then that we can come to some sort of understanding. I’m here to negotiate.
951,Elizabeth,"These Letters of Marque, they are signed by the King?"
953,Elizabeth,"Or else I would not still be here. You sent Will to get you the compass and buy Jack Sparrow, it Will do you no good."
955,Elizabeth,"I have been to the Isla de Muerta, I have seen the treasure myself. There is something you need to know."
957,Elizabeth,
959,Elizabeth,These are not going to Jack.
978,Jack,
979,Will,Why would he do this to us? If Jack is the chief –
981,Will,So he had no choice. He’s a captive there as much as the rest of us.
983,Will,Where’s the rest of the Crew?
985,Will,"Well, we can’t just sit here and wait then, can we?"
986,Jack,Well done.
988,Will,"Come on men, it’ll take all of us to Crew the Black Pearl!"
990,Will,
992,Will,
994,Will,Stop.
996,Will,Move!
998,Jack,"Well, go on, go get them! Helalla!"
1000,Will,"Pull it loose, find a rock!"
1001,Will,Roll the cage!  Lift the cage!
1005,Jack,Stop it!
1008,Jack,
1017,Will,What about Jack? I won’t leave without him.
1018,Jack,Oi!
1019,Will,Time to go.
1022,Jack,Oi!  – Captain Jack Sparrow.
1024,Jack,"Yes to the first, yes to the second, but only as so far as we keep to the shallows as much as possible."
1026,Jack,"I have every faith in your reconciliatory navigational skills, Master Gibbs. Now, where is that monkey? I want to shoot something."
1027,Will,Jack.
1028,Jack,Ah.
1029,Will,Elizabeth is in danger.
1030,Jack,Have you considered keeping a more watchful eye on her. Maybe just lock her up somewhere?
1031,Will,"She is locked up in a prison, bound to hang for helping you."
1032,Jack,There comes a time when one must take responsibility for one’s mistakes.
1033,Will,"I need that compass of yours, Jack. I must trade it for her freedom."
1034,Jack,Mr. Gibbs?
1036,Jack,We have a need to travel upriver.
1038,Jack,"No, a resolute and unyielding need."
1039,Will,What we need to do is make sail for Port Royal with all haste.
1040,Jack,"William… I shall trade you the compass, if you Will help me…  to find this."
1041,Will,You want me to find this.
1042,Jack,"No. You want you to find this. Because the finding of this, finds you incapacitorially finding and/or locating in your discovering the detecting of a way to save your dolly belle ol’ what’s her face. Savvy?"
1043,Will,This is going to save Elizabeth.
1044,Jack,How much do you know about Davy Jones?
1045,Will,Not much.
1046,Jack,"Yeah, it’s going to save Elizabeth."
1057,Will,Why is Jack afraid of the open ocean?
1059,Will,And the key Will spare him that?
1061,Will,Her?
1063,Jack,"No worries, mates. Tia Dalma and I go way back. Thick as thieves. Nigh inseparable we are. Were. Have been. Before."
1065,Jack,It’s me front I’m worried about.
1067,Will,Mind the boat.
1073,Jack,Tia Dalma.
1075,Will,You know me?
1077,Jack,There’ll be no knowing here.  I thought I knew you.
1079,Jack,Come.
1081,Jack,I brought payment.  an undead monkey. Top that!
1084,Will,We’re looking for this.  And what it goes to.
1086,Jack,Maybe. Why?
1092,Will,What vexes all men?
1097,Jack,A woman!
1101,Will,What exactly did he put into the chest?
1106,Will,You knew this.
1107,Jack,"I did not. I didn’t know where the key was. But now we do. So, all that’s left is to climb aboard the Flying Dutchman, grab the key, you go back to Port Royal and save your bonnie lass, aye?"
1111,Jack,"My eyesight’s as good as ever, just so you know."
1113,Jack,Dirt. This is a jar of dirt.
1115,Jack,Is the… jar of dirt going to help?
1117,Jack,No.
1119,Will,It seems… we have a need to find the Flying Dutchman.
1123,Will,That’s the Flying Dutchman?  She doesn’t look like much.
1124,Jack,Neither do you… do not underestimate it.
1126,Jack,What’s your plan?
1127,Will,"I row over, search the ship until I find your bloody key."
1128,Jack,And if there are Crewmen?
1129,Will,I cut down anyone in my path.
1130,Jack,"I like it. Simple, easy to remember."
1132,Jack,"Oi! If you do have to get captured, just say Jack Sparrow sent you to settle his debt. Might save your life."
1134,Jack,Douse the lamps.
1135,Will,"Sailor. Sailor! There’s no use, you’ve run aground."
1137,Will,
1139,Will,Get back! Back!
1150,Will,Jack Sparrow sent me to settle his debt.
1152,Will,Jack Sparrow… sent me to settle his debt.
1154,Jack,Oh.
1156,Jack,"Technically, I was only Captain for two years, then I was viciously mutinied upon."
1158,Jack,"Yeah, I gave you payment. One soul to serve on your ship is already over there."
1160,Jack,"Aha! So we’ve establish my proposal is sound in principle, now we’re just haggling over price."
1162,Jack,"Just how many souls, do you think, my soul is worth?"
1164,Jack,"You’re a darling, mate. Send me back the boy, I’ll get started right off."
1166,Jack,"Have you not met Will Turner? He’s noble, heroic, a terrific soprano. Worth at least four, maybe three and a half. And did I happen to mention… he’s in love. With a girl. Due to be married. Betrothed. Dividing him from her and her from him would only be half as cruel as actually allowing them to be joined in holy matrimony. Aye?"
1168,Jack,Ah.
1170,Jack,"Uh, Mr. Gibbs?"
1172,Jack,I feel sullied and unusual.
1174,Jack,"Fortunately, he was mum as the condition in which these souls need be."
1176,Jack,Tortuga.
1183,Elizabeth,
1188,Elizabeth,
1194,Jack,
1197,Jack,I know what I want.
1202,Jack,How are we going?
1209,Jack,You’re hired.
1212,Jack,Time to go.
1214,Jack,
1216,Elizabeth,What has the world done to you?
1220,Will,Step aside!
1236,Will,I don’t need your help.
1238,Will,So I’m to understand what you did was an act of compassion.
1240,Will,I’ve sworn no oath.
1242,Will,The key.
1244,Will,What do you know of it?
1246,Will,So the Captain has the key.  Where is the key?
1248,Will,Where is the chest.
1251,Elizabeth,Captain Sparrow?
1252,Jack,"Come to join me Crew, lad? Welcome aboard."
1253,Elizabeth,I’m here to find the man I love.
1254,Jack,"I’m deeply flattered, son, but my first and only love is the sea."
1255,Elizabeth,"Meaning William Turner, Captain Sparrow."
1256,Jack,You know these clothes do not flatter you at all. It should be a dress or nothing. I happen to have no dress in my cabin.
1257,Elizabeth,"Jack. I know Will came to find you, where is he?"
1258,Jack,"Darling, I am truly unhappy to have to tell you this, but through an unfortunate and entirely unforeseeable series of circumstances that had nothing whatsoever to do with me, poor Will has been press-ganged into Davy Jones’s Crew."
1259,Elizabeth,Davy Jones?
1261,Jack,"You look bloody awful, what are you doing here?"
1263,Jack,You smell funny.
1264,Elizabeth,Jack!
1265,Jack,Hmm.
1266,Elizabeth,All I want is to find Will.
1267,Jack,Are you certain? Is that what you really want most?
1268,Elizabeth,Of course.
1269,Jack,"Because I would think, you’d want to find a way to save Will most."
1270,Elizabeth,And you’d have a way of doing that?
1271,Jack,"Well, there is a chest."
1273,Jack,A chest of unknown size and origin.
1275,Jack,"And whoever possesses that chest, possesses the leverage to command Jones to do whatever it is he or she wants. Including saving brave William from his grim fate."
1277,Elizabeth,How do we find it?
1278,Jack,With this.  My compass… is unique.
1280,Jack,True enough.  This compass does not point north.
1281,Elizabeth,Where does it point?
1282,Jack,It points to the thing you want most in this world.
1283,Elizabeth,Jack.  Are you telling the truth?
1284,Jack,"Every word, love. And what you want most in this world…  is to find the chest of Davy Jones, is it not?"
1285,Elizabeth,To save Will.
1286,Jack,By finding the chest of Davy Jones.  Mr. Gibbs!
1288,Jack,We have our heading.
1290,Jack,
1310,Will,"I understand. It’s a game of deception. The game includes all the dice, not just your own. What are they waging?"
1312,Will,So any Crew member can be challenged?
1314,Will,I challenge Davy Jones.
1316,Will,My soul. An eternity of servitude.
1319,Will,I want this.
1321,Will,"That’s not part of the game, is it?  You can still walk away."
1324,Will,No. Don’t do this.
1327,Will,Four five’s.
1330,Will,Eight five’s.
1334,Will,Fool. Why did you do that?
1336,Will,It was never about winning or losing.
1339,Will,It’s not a fate you had to choose for yourself either.
1341,Will,They’ll know you helped me.
1343,Will,I promise.
1345,Jack,Beckett.
1346,Elizabeth,"Yes, they’re signed ‘Lord Cutler Beckett of the East India Trading Company.’"
1347,Jack,
1349,Jack,Ah.
1351,Jack,Of course. He wants the chest.
1352,Elizabeth,"Yes, he did say something about a chest."
1354,Jack,"A truly discomforting notion, love."
1356,Jack,Might I enquire as to how you came by these.
1357,Elizabeth,Persuasion.
1358,Jack,Friendly?
1359,Elizabeth,Decidedly not.
1360,Jack,"Will strikes a deal for these and upholds it with honor, yet you are the one standing here with the prize.  As if I could be bought for such a low price."
1361,Elizabeth,"Jack, the letters, give them back."
1362,Jack,No. Persuade me.
1363,Elizabeth,You do know Will taught me how to handle a sword.
1364,Jack,
1366,Elizabeth,I don’t know what you mean.
1368,Elizabeth,"Oh, don’t be absurd, I trust him, that’s all."
1371,Will,Just put as many leagues behind us as you can. As fast as you can.
1373,Will,That dress… where did you get it?
1375,Will,That’s foolish.
1379,Will,I imagine… some of your Crew may have jumped ship there.
1385,Will,Or worse.
1388,Will,I have doomed us all. It’s the Flying Dutchman!
1402,Jack,My tremendous intuitive sense of the female creature informs me that you are… troubled.
1403,Elizabeth,I just thought Iâ€™d be married by now. I’m so ready to be married.
1404,Jack,"Lizzie, I am Captain of a ship and being Captain of a ship I could, in fact, perform a marriage right here. Right on this deck. Rightâ€¦ now."
1405,Elizabeth,"No, thank you."
1406,Jack,Why not? We are very much alike you and I. I and you… us.
1407,Elizabeth,Except for a sense of honor and decency and a moral center. And personal hygiene.
1408,Jack,"Trifles. You Will come over to my side, I know it."
1409,Elizabeth,You seem very certain.
1410,Jack,"One word, love"
1411,Elizabeth,Why doesn’t your compass work?
1412,Jack,My compass works fine.
1413,Elizabeth,Because you and I are alike. And there Will come a moment when you have a chance to show it. To do the right thing.
1414,Jack,I love those moments. I like to wave at them as they pass by.
1415,Elizabeth,"You’ll have the chance to do something… something courageous. And when you, you’ll discover something. That you’re a good man."
1416,Jack,All evidence to the contrary.
1417,Elizabeth,"No, I have faith in you. You want to know why?"
1418,Jack,"Do tell, dearie."
1419,Elizabeth,Curiosity. You’re going to want it – a chance to be admired – and gain the rewards that follow. You won’t be able to resist. You’re going to want to know what it tastes like.
1420,Jack,I do want to know what it tastes like.
1421,Elizabeth,"I’m proud of you, Jack."
1423,Jack,I need my jar of dirt.
1432,Jack,Guard the boat; mind the tides… don’t touch my dirt.
1433,Elizabeth,
1434,Jack,"Yes, it does, you’re sitting on it."
1435,Elizabeth,Beg pardon?
1436,Jack,
1444,Elizabeth,It’s real.
1446,Jack,"I do that quite a lot, yet people are still surprised."
1447,Will,With good reason.
1448,Elizabeth,Will.
1449,Jack,How did you get here?
1450,Will,"Sea turtles, mate. A pair of them strapped to my feet."
1451,Jack,Not so easy is it?
1452,Will,"But I do owe you thanks, Jack."
1453,Jack,You do?
1454,Will,"After you tricked me onto that ship, to square your debt with Jones."
1455,Elizabeth,What?
1456,Jack,What?
1457,Will,I was reunited with my father.
1458,Jack,"Oh, well, you’re welcome, then."
1459,Elizabeth,"Everything you said to me, every word was a lie!"
1460,Jack,"Pretty much. Time and tide, love.  Oi, what are you doing?"
1461,Will,I’m gonna kill Jones.
1462,Jack,"Can’t let you do that, William. ‘Cause if Jones is dead, who’s to call his terrible beastie off the hunt, eh?  The key."
1463,Will,"I keep the promises I make, Jack. I intend to free my father. And I hope you’re here to see it."
1465,Jack,I knew you’d warm up to me eventually.
1467,Jack,Ah. The dark side of ambition.
1469,Elizabeth,Stop it!
1470,Will,Guard the chest.
1471,Elizabeth,No!
1474,Elizabeth,This is madness!
1478,Elizabeth,
1479,Jack,
1481,Will,
1483,Will,Be my guest.
1484,Jack,"Let us examine that claim for a moment, former Commodore, shall we? Who was it that at the very moment you had a notorious pirate safely behind bars saw fit to free said pirate and take your dearly beloved all to hisself… aye? So whose fault is it really that you’ve ended up a rum-pot deckhand what takes orders from pirates?"
1486,Jack,Oh.
1488,Elizabeth,Sword!
1491,Jack,Hmm.
1493,Jack,"Oh, shut it."
1494,Jack,
1495,Will,
1496,Elizabeth,Will.
1497,Jack,Leave him lie! Unless you plan on using him to hit something with.
1498,Elizabeth,We’re not coming out of this.
1500,Elizabeth,You’re mad.
1502,Jack,I-I say we respect his final wish.
1508,Will,What happened to the chest?
1509,Elizabeth,Norrington took it to draw them off.
1513,Jack,Fell behind.
1515,Elizabeth,
1517,Jack,"I’ve got a jar of di-irt, I’ve got a jar of di-irt, and guess what’s inside it?"
1519,Jack,Hard to starboard.
1520,Elizabeth,Hard to starboard!
1521,Will,Raise up the foreyard!
1526,Will,Make fast!
1528,Elizabeth,She’s falling behind!
1530,Will,We’re the faster?
1532,Will,We’ve got her advantage.
1538,Will,"My father is on that ship. If we can outrun her, we can take her. We should turn and fight."
1539,Jack,Why fight when you can negotiate? All one needs is the proper leverage.  Where is it? Where is the thump thump?
1541,Will,No. It’s not a reef!  Get away from the rail!
1542,Elizabeth,What is it?
1543,Will,The Kraken. To arms!
1545,Will,"It’ll attack the starboard, I’ve seen it before. Roll out the cannons and hold for my signal."
1546,Will,Easy boys.
1547,Elizabeth,Will?
1548,Will,Steady! Steady.
1549,Elizabeth,Will?
1550,Will,Hold. Hold!
1552,Elizabeth,Will!
1553,Will,Fire!  It’ll be back. We have to get off the ship.
1554,Elizabeth,There’s no boats.
1555,Will,"Whatever you do, don’t miss."
1556,Elizabeth,As soon as you’re clear.
1559,Will,Then load the rum!
1561,Elizabeth,
1563,Will,Haul away!
1567,Will,Hyah! Come on!
1568,Will,
1571,Jack,Abandon ship. Into the long boat.
1573,Jack,"She’s only a ship, mate."
1574,Elizabeth,"He’s right, we have to head for land."
1577,Will,We’ll have to try it. We can get away as it takes down the Pearl.
1579,Elizabeth,"Thank you, Jack."
1580,Jack,"We’re not free yet, though."
1581,Elizabeth,You came back. I always knew you were a good man.
1583,Elizabeth,I’m not sorry.
1584,Jack,Pirate.
1585,Will,Where’s Jack?
1586,Elizabeth,He elected to stay behind to give us a chance.
1587,Jack,
1600,Will,Doesnâ€™t matter now. The Pearl’s gone… along with its Captain.
1604,Elizabeth,He was a good man.
1605,Will,"If there was anything to be done to bring him back, Elizabeth…"
1611,Elizabeth,Yes.
1612,Will,Aye.
1623,Elizabeth,"...the bell has been raised from its watery grave; hear its sepulchral tone? A call to all, pay heed the squall, and turn your sails toward home!... yo ho, all together, hoist the colors high. Yo ho, thieves..."
1627,Elizabeth,And what makes you think I need protecting?
1631,Elizabeth,Have you heard anything from Will?
1633,Elizabeth,Is he that terrifying?
1646,Elizabeth,Because you happen to have a ship a and crew you don’t need?
1662,Elizabeth,"You can fight!  Get off me! You are Sao Feng, the pirate lord of Singapore!"
1663,Elizabeth,"...would you have that era come to an end on your watch? The most notorious pirates from around the world are uniting against our enemy, and yet you sit here, cowering in your bath water!"
1665,Will,Jack Sparrow.  He’s one of the pirate lords.
1673,Will,"If he’s not with you, and he’s not with us...who’s he with?"
1674,Elizabeth,Will!
1677,Will,It is coincidence only.  If you want to make a deal with Beckett you need what I offer.
1679,Will,I need the Black Pearl to free my father.  You’re helping me to get it.
1685,Will,"And better yet, a ship and a crew."
1686,Elizabeth,Where’s Sao Feng?
1687,Will,He’ll cover our escape and meet us at Shipwreck Cove.
1689,Elizabeth,There’s no place left for Sao Feng to cower. Do you think he will honor the call?
1711,Will,Nothing here is set. These can’t be as accurate as modern charts. Tai Huang
1712,Will,"Over the edge and over again. Sunrise sets flash of green... Do you care to interpret, Captain Barbossa?"
1731,Will,How long do we continue not talking?
1732,Elizabeth,Once we rescue Jack everything will be fine.
1733,Will,When we rescue Jack?
1735,Will,Barbossa! Ahead!
1737,Elizabeth,Lost?
1741,Will,"To stations! All hands, to stations! Hard to port, gather way!"
1744,Elizabeth,You’ve doomed us all!
1746,Will,Tie her off!
1748,Elizabeth,Hard to port!
1749,Will,Hold on!
1753,Jack,My peanut. All hands slackened braces!
1761,Jack,Mr. Sparrow.
1763,Jack,What say you about the condition of this tack line?
1765,Jack,"Proper? It is neither proper nor suitable, sir, it is neither acceptable nor adequate. It is in obvious fact an abomination."
1767,Jack,"Shall I?  That sort of thinking got us into this mess. Gentlemen, we have lost speed and therefore time, precious time, which cannot be regained once lost. Do you understand?"
1769,Jack,"It will all have to be redone, all of it! And let that serve as a lesson to the lot of you!"
1771,Elizabeth,"I don’t see Jack, I don’t see anyone."
1773,Will,"It doesn’t matter, we’re trapped here by your doing, no different than Jack."
1780,Jack,Mr Gibbs!
1782,Jack,"I thought so. I expect you can account for your actions, then?"
1784,Jack,"There has been a perpetual and virulent lack of discipline aboard my vessel! Why is that, sir?"
1786,Jack,"I know that. I know where I am, and don’t think I don’t."
1788,Jack,"Ah, Hector. It’s been too long, hasn’t it?"
1790,Jack,"No I didn’t. Ah, Tia Dalma, out and about, eh? You lend an agreeable sense of the macabre to any delirium."
1791,Will,He thinks we’re a hallucination.
1792,Jack,"William, tell me something. Have you come because you need my help to rescue a certain distressing damsel? Or rather a damsel in distress? Either one."
1793,Jack,Then you wouldn’t be here. So you can’t be here. Q.E.D. you’re not really here.
1794,Elizabeth,"Jack, this is real, we’re here."
1795,Jack,"The locker, you say?"
1797,Elizabeth,We’ve come to rescue you.
1798,Jack,"Have you, now? That’s very kind of you. But seeing as I possess a ship and you don’t, it seems as though you’re the ones in need of rescuing and I’m not sure as I’m in the mood."
1800,Jack,"Can’t spot it, must be a tiny little thing hiding somewhere behind the Pearl."
1801,Will,Jack. Cutler Beckett has the heart of Davy Jones. He controls the Flying Dutchman.
1802,Elizabeth,He’s taking over the seas.
1804,Jack,"Leave you people alone for a minute and look what’s happened, everything’s gone to pot."
1806,Will,And you need a crew.
1807,Jack,"Why should I sail with any of you? Four of you have tried to kill me in the past, one of you succeeded."
1808,Jack,"Oh, she’s not told you? You’ll have loads to talk about while you’re here.  As for you..."
1810,Jack,"All right, fair enough, you’re in.  Who are you?"
1812,Jack,Where do your allegiances lie?
1814,Jack,I have a ship.
1816,Jack,"Good man. Weigh anchor, all hands, prepare to make sail."
1820,Jack,Trim that sail!
1822,Jack,Slack windward brace and sheets!
1824,Jack,Haul that pallet line!
1826,Jack,What are YOU doing?
1828,Jack,What are YOU doing?
1830,Jack,What are YOU doing? Captain gives orders on the ship!
1832,Jack,"My ship, makes me captain."
1834,Jack,That makes you...chart man!
1838,Will,You left Jack to the Kraken?
1839,Elizabeth,"He’s rescued now, it’s done with. Will, I had no choice."
1840,Will,You chose not to tell me.
1841,Elizabeth,I couldn’t. It wasn’t your burden to bear.
1842,Will,"But I did bear it, didn’t I? I just didn’t know what it was. I thought..."
1843,Elizabeth,You thought I loved him.
1844,Will,"If you make your choices alone, how can I trust you?"
1845,Elizabeth,You can’t.
1853,Will,"They’re not a threat to us, am I right?"
1856,Elizabeth,"It’s my father, we’ve made it back. Father here, look here!"
1857,Jack,"Elizabeth, we’re not back."
1858,Elizabeth,Father!
1860,Elizabeth,"No, no."
1862,Elizabeth,"No, you can’t be!"
1864,Elizabeth,Come aboard!
1866,Elizabeth,Someone cast a line!
1868,Elizabeth,Take the line!
1870,Elizabeth,"Father, the line, take the line!"
1872,Elizabeth,"Father, come back with us! I won’t leave you!"
1873,Will,Elizabeth.
1875,Will,Is there a way?
1881,Will,Why doesn’t he do something?
1884,Will,"And the green flash happens at sunset, not sunrise."
1886,Jack,UP IS DOWN. Well that’s just maddeningly unhelpful. Why are these things never clear?
1889,Jack,Come again?
1891,Jack,Well that’s more than less than unhelpful.
1893,Jack,I love the sea.
1895,Jack,I prefer rum. Rum’s good.
1899,Jack,Once every ten years.
1902,Jack,Even longer given the deficit of rum.
1905,Jack,"Oh, I like that."
1907,Jack,"Not sunset, sundown... and rise.  What’s that? I don’t know, what IS that? What do you think?"
1908,Elizabeth,Where?
1909,Jack,There!
1910,Elizabeth,What is it?
1915,Jack,Now up is down.
1918,Elizabeth,It’s the sunrise.
1922,Jack,"I is arguin’ the point. If there’s pirates a-gatherin’, I’m pointing my ship the other way."
1923,Elizabeth,"The pirates are gathering to fight Beckett, and you’re a pirate."
1924,Will,"Fight or not, you’re not running, Jack."
1926,Jack,"I quite like the sound of that. Captain Jack Sparrow, the last pirate."
1928,Jack,"I’m still working on that. But I’ll not be going back to the locker, mate, count on that."
1932,Will,"There’s a freshwater spring on this island. We can resupply there, and get back to shooting each other later."
1933,Jack,"You can lead the shore party, and I’ll stay with my ship."
1935,Will,Why don’t you both go ashore and leave the ship in my command... temporarily.
1943,Jack,"Sometimes, things come back, mate. We’re living proof, you and me."
1945,Jack,"Summoning the Brethren Court, then, is it?"
1947,Jack,That’s a sad commentary in and of itself.
1949,Jack,The world’s still the same. There’s just less in it.
1955,Jack,He’s the captain.
1958,Jack,"That doesn’t sound like me.  Shall we just call it square, then?"
1959,Will,Release her. She’s not part of the bargain.
1962,Jack,Captain Turner?
1964,Will,I need the Pearl to free my father. That’s the only reason I came on this voyage.
1965,Elizabeth,Why didn’t you tell me you were planning this?
1966,Will,It was my burden to bear.
1967,Jack,He needs the Pearl! Captain Turner needs the Pearl! And you felt guilty. And you and your Brethren Court! Did no one come to save me just because they missed me?  I’m standing over there with them.
1969,Jack,I’m not certain I can survive any more visits from old friends.
1972,Jack,What? What isn’t?
1974,Jack,"By my reckoning, that account has been settled."
1976,Jack,Close your eyes and pretend it’s all a bad dream. That’s how I get by.
1980,Will,"You agreed, the Black Pearl was to be mine."
1983,Jack,"Regarding the Brethren Court, no doubt? In exchange for fair compensation, square my debt with Jones, guarantee my freedom?"
1985,Jack,"Were I in a divulgatory mood, what then might I divulge?"
1996,Jack,"You can keep Barbossa, the belligerent homunculus and his friend with the wooden eye both, and Turner... especially Turner. The rest go with me aboard the Pearl, and I will lead you to Shipwreck Cove, where I will hand you the pirates and you will NOT hand me to Jones. Bloody fair deal, don’t you think?"
1998,Jack,What interest is she to you?
2002,Elizabeth,What?
2004,Will,Elizabeth is not part of any bargain!
2007,Jack,"It points to what you want most, and that’s not the Brethren Court, is it?"
2009,Jack,Me. Dead.
2010,Elizabeth,Done.
2011,Will,What? Not done!
2012,Elizabeth,"You got us into this mess! If this is what frees us, then done!"
2014,Will,Elizabeth! They’re pirates!
2015,Elizabeth,I’ve had more than enough experience dealing with pirates!
2017,Jack,"With me killed, you’d arrive at Shipwreck Cove, find its stronghold nigh impregnable, able to withstand blockade for years, and then you’d wish, “Oh, if only there were someone I had not killed inside to assure that the pirates then come outside...”"
2019,Jack,"You may kill me, but you may never insult me. Who am I?  Done!"
2021,Jack,"Thank goodness for that, because if I wasn’t, this would probably never work."
2022,Jack,And that was without a single drop of rum.  Send this pestilent traitorous cowhearted yeasty codpiece to the brig.
2029,Elizabeth,Excuse me?
2031,Elizabeth,We being who?
2033,Elizabeth,Confirm what? You’ve told me nothing.
2035,Elizabeth,...me.
2037,Elizabeth,Pretty speech from a captor. But words whispered through prison bars lose their charm.
2039,Elizabeth,And some men offer desire as justification for their crimes.
2041,Elizabeth,And in return?
2043,Elizabeth,And if I should choose not?
2045,Elizabeth,Sao Feng!
2047,Elizabeth,Me?
2051,Elizabeth,He made me captain.
2054,Elizabeth,James!
2056,Elizabeth,My father’s dead.
2058,Elizabeth,Did Lord Beckett tell you that?
2063,Elizabeth,"Thank you, but I prefer to remain with my crew."
2065,Elizabeth,Know what? Which side you chose?  Well now you do.
2066,Elizabeth,Bootstrap?
2067,Elizabeth,Bootstrap? Bill Turner?
2069,Elizabeth,"Yes, I know your son. Will Turner."
2071,Elizabeth,"Yes, Will is alive. And he wants to help you."
2073,Elizabeth,But you’re his father.
2075,Elizabeth,Me?
2077,Elizabeth,"Yes, I’m Elizabeth."
2079,Elizabeth,I see.
2081,Elizabeth,Bootstrap.
2083,Elizabeth,"Yes, I know your son."
2092,Jack,"Bravo, you escaped the brig even quicker than I expected. William, do you notice something? Or rather do you notice something that is not there to be noted?"
2093,Will,You haven’t raised an alarm.
2094,Jack,"Odd, isn’t it? But not as odd as this. Come up with this all by your lonesome, did you?"
2095,Will,"I said to myself, think like Jack."
2096,Jack,"And this is what you’ve arrived at? Lead Beckett to Shipwreck Cove so as to gain his trust, accomplish your own ends? It’s like you don’t know me at all, mate. And how does your dearly beloved feel about this?  Ah, you’ve not seen fit to trust her with it."
2097,Will,I’m losing her Jack. Every step I take for my father is a step away from Elizabeth.
2098,Jack,"Mate, if you choose to lock your heart away, you’ll lose it for certain. If I may lend a machete to your intellectual thicket—avoid the choice altogether. Change the facts. Let someone else dispatch Jones."
2099,Will,Who?  You?
2100,Jack,"Death has a curious way or reshuffling one’s priorities. I’ll slip aboard the Dutchman, find the heart, stab the beating thing. Your father goes free, and you’re free to be with your charming murderess."
2101,Will,"And you’re willing to carve out your heart and bind yourself to the Dutchman, forever."
2102,Jack,"No mate, I’m free forever. Free to sail the seas beyond the edges of the map, free from death itself."
2103,Will,"You’ve got to do the job though, Jack. You have to ferry souls to the next world. Or end up just like Jones."
2104,Jack,"I don’t have the face for tentacles. But immortal has to count for something, eh? Oh!"
2105,Will,What’s this for?
2106,Jack,"Think like me, it’ll come to you.  My regards to Davy Jones!"
2107,Will,I hate him.
2109,Elizabeth,What are you doing?
2111,Elizabeth,It’s too late to earn my forgiveness.
2113,Elizabeth,"Come with us. James, come with me."
2116,Elizabeth,You’re lying.
2124,Elizabeth,James! James! No!
2134,Jack,"For all that pirates are clever cobs, we are an unimaginative lot when it comes to naming things."
2136,Jack,I once sailed with a geezer lost both of his arms and part of his eye.
2138,Jack,Larry.
2146,Will,"Not yours, his. Jack Sparrow sends his regards."
2148,Will,You’ve not told him? We rescued Jack from the locker along with the Black Pearl.
2152,Will,Not quite so well actually. The Brethren Court intends to release her.
2156,Will,"You loved her. She’s the one, and then you betrayed her."
2158,Will,"And after which betrayal did you cut out your heart, I wonder?"
2160,Will,"I hadn’t finished that. You will free my father.  And you will guarantee Elizabeth’s safety, along with my own."
2163,Will,Calypso is aboard the Black Pearl. Jack has sailed the Black Pearl to Shipwreck Cove.
2165,Will,What is it you want most?
2169,Jack,And I owe them all money.
2179,Jack,"Might I point out that we are still short one pirate lord, and I’m content as a cucumber to wait until Sao Feng joins us."
2180,Elizabeth,Sao Feng is dead. He fell to the Flying Dutchman.
2181,Jack,And made you captain? They’re just giving the bloody title away now.
2182,Elizabeth,"Listen. Our location has been betrayed. Jones is under the command of Lord Beckett, they’re on their way here."
2185,Elizabeth,Where’s Will?
2186,Jack,Not among us.
2188,Elizabeth,We fight!
2193,Jack,"Shoot him and cut out his tongue, then shoot his tongue. And trim that scraggly beard."
2200,Elizabeth,This is madness.
2201,Jack,This is politics.
2202,Elizabeth,Meanwhile our enemies are bearing down upon us.
2217,Jack,"Whose boons? Your boons? Utterly deceptive twaddlespeak, says I."
2219,Jack,"Cuttlefish. Let us not, dear friends, forget our dear friends the cuttlefish. Flippant glorious little sausages. Pen ‘em up together and they’ll devour each other without a second thought. Human nature, isn’t it?...or....or fish nature.  So yes, we could hole up here well provisioned and well armed and half of us would be dead within the month, which seems grim to me any way you slice it. Or, as my learned colleague so naively suggests, we could release Calypso, and we can pray that she will be merciful. I rather doubt it. Can we in fact pretend that she is anything other than a woman scorned, like which fury hell hath no? We cannot. Res ipso loquitur tabula in naufragio , we are left with but one option. I agree with, and I cannot believe the words are comin’ out of me mouth, Captain Swann. We must fight."
2221,Jack,I have not!
2223,Jack,Have not!
2225,Jack,Have not!
2227,Jack,"Have not, slander and calumny! I have only ever embraced that oldest and noblest of pirate traditions. I submit here and now, that is what we all must do, we must fight... to run away."
2230,Jack,You made that up.
2237,Jack,"Hang on a minute.  It shall be the duty of the king to declare war, parlay with said adversaries... fancy that."
2240,Elizabeth,Why not?
2243,Jack,I call for a vote.
2249,Elizabeth,Elizabeth Swann.
2252,Jack,Elizabeth Swann.
2253,Elizabeth,What?
2254,Jack,"I know, curious isn’t it?"
2256,Jack,"Am I to understand that you lot will not be keeping to the code, then?"
2258,Elizabeth,"Prepare every vessel that floats. At dawn, we’re at war. SeSumbhajee"
2259,Jack,"What? You’ve seen it all, done it all, you survived. That’s the trick, isn’t it? To survive."
2261,Jack,How’s mum?
2262,Jack,She looks great.
2266,Jack,Parlay?
2269,Jack,My hands are clean in this... figuratively.
2270,Will,My actions were my own and to my own purpose. Jack had nothing to do with it.
2271,Jack,"Well spoke, listen to the tool."
2272,Elizabeth,"Will, I’ve been aboard the Dutchman, I understand the burden you bear, but I fear that cause is lost."
2273,Will,No cause is lost if there is but one fool left to fight for it.
2276,Jack,"That debt was paid, mate, with  help."
2278,Jack,Technically...
2279,Elizabeth,"I propose an exchange. Will leaves with us, and you can take Jack."
2280,Will,Done.
2281,Jack,Undone.
2284,Elizabeth,King.
2285,Jack,As you command.
2287,Jack,"First to the finish, then?"
2289,Jack,You have no idea.
2291,Elizabeth,You murdered my father.
2293,Elizabeth,"And you have chosen yours. We will fight, and you will die."
2295,Will,King?
2296,Elizabeth,Of the Brethren Court. Courtesy of Jack.
2297,Will,Maybe he really does know what he’s doing.
2300,Jack,Go away!
2305,Elizabeth,We’ll use the Black Pearl as a flagship to lead the attack.
2308,Will,"Barbossa, you can’t release her."
2309,Elizabeth,We have to give Jack a chance.
2320,Will,"Tia Dalma. Calypso.  When the Brethren Court first imprisoned you, who was it that told them how? Who was it that betrayed you?"
2322,Will,Davy Jones.
2325,Will,Was that it?
2328,Elizabeth,It’s not over.
2329,Will,There’s still a fight to be had.
2331,Elizabeth,Only a fool’s chance.
2333,Elizabeth,"You’re right. Then what shall we die for?  You will listen to me. Listen! The brethren will still be looking here to us, to the Black Pearl to lead, and what will they see? Frightened bilge rats aboard a derelict ship? No! They will see free men, and freedom. And what the enemy will see is the flash of our cannons, they will hear the ring of our swords and they will know what we can do! By the sweat of our brows, and the strength of our backs, and the courage of our hearts... gentlemen, hoist the colors!"
2334,Will,Hoist the colors.
2338,Elizabeth,Hoist the colors!!!
2344,Elizabeth,"Captain Barbossa, we need you at the helm."
2350,Will,On our stern and gaining!
2353,Will,Take her out or she’ll overbear us!
2355,Elizabeth,Prepare to broadside!
2357,Will,At the ready!
2358,Jack,Think like the whelp... think like the whelp... think like the whelp... half barrel hinges... leverage!
2365,Elizabeth,Fire!
2366,Will,Fire!
2370,Jack,"Good one. I just came to get me effects. Admirable though it may be, why are you here when you could be elsewhere?"
2380,Jack,"To my great regret. But, never to late to learn, eh?"
2382,Jack,"I can set you free, mate."
2384,Will,Elizabeth! Elizabeth! Will you marry me?
2385,Elizabeth,I don’t think now is the best time!
2386,Will,Now may be the only time! I love you. I’ve made my choice. What’s yours?
2387,Elizabeth,Barbossa! Marry us!
2389,Will,Barbossa! Now!
2391,Will,"Elizabeth Swann, do you take me to be your husband?"
2392,Elizabeth,I do.
2393,Will,Great!
2394,Elizabeth,"Will Turner, do you take me...to be your wife, in sickness and in health, with health being the less likely?"
2395,Will,I do.
2399,Jack,I already have the key.
2401,Jack,"Oh, that key."
2404,Will,"Thank you, Jack."
2406,Elizabeth,That’s why I brought this!
2408,Jack,"Do you?  Heady tonic, holding life and death in the palm of one’s hand."
2410,Jack,Cruel is a matter of perspective.
2413,Elizabeth,Will! Will! Look at me! Look at me!
2415,Elizabeth,No! no! no! no!
2417,Elizabeth,Don’t leave me! I won’t leave you!
2420,Jack,Never actually been one for tradition... Close haul her. Luff the sails and lay on iron!
2422,Jack,Belay that ‘belay that.’
2424,Jack,Belay!
2426,Jack,Belay!
2428,Jack,Belay!
2430,Jack,Stow. Shut it!
2434,Will,Ready on the guns!
2435,Jack,Full canvas!
2439,Jack,Fire!
2441,Will,Fire!
2442,Elizabeth,Fire all!
2449,Jack,"Mr. Gibbs, you may throw my hat if you like."
2451,Jack,Now go and get it.
2453,Will,You’re no longer bound to the Dutchman. You’re free.
2455,Will,"On the wheel, then, Mr. Turner."
2457,Will,Depends on the one day.
2462,Elizabeth,Jack. It would never have worked out between us.
2463,Jack,"Keep telling yourself that, darlin’.  Once was quite enough."
2464,Elizabeth,Thank you.
2465,Will,I’m gonna need the other one.  It’s always belonged to you. Will you keep it safe?
2466,Elizabeth,"Yes, yes."
2467,Will,Keep a weather eye on the horizon.
2468,Jack,"Granted, it tends to list to port and has on occasion been known to frighten young women, but I guarantee you will not be disappointed."
2472,Jack,"That, love, is a dinghy. My vessel is magnificent, and fierce, and huge-ish, and... gone. Why is it gone?"
2474,Jack,"Yes, there it is. Why is it there? It’s much larger up close."
2478,Jack,"Mr. Gibbs, any particular reason why my ship is gone?"
2480,Jack,"Really?  And by the way, no, I’ve never actually met Pisaro, but I love his pies. And all of this pales into utter insignificance in light of the fact that my ship is once again, gone, savvy?"
2482,Jack,Give nothing back.
