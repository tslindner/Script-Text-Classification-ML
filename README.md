Interesting findings:
    Overall:
        SGD/SVM best but most inconsistent:
        Random Forest best consistent result:
        Naive Bayesian worst but most consistent:
        SGD/SVM does worse with 8char than 4char:

        Differences between 4char and 8char:
            4char better at low min lengths, same at high:
        Differences based on min length:
            10 better than 20 for 8ch:
            10 better than 30 better than 20 for 4ch:
