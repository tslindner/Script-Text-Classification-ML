# Real-Estate-Visualization-DC
GWU Project due 2018-06-30 (Tim Lindner, Arjun Maniyar, Justin Neuda, Hasan Khalid)

I've included the basic flask directory stucture (static, Modules, templates).

I also made work in progress directories, where each of us can share our work without getting in each other's ways.  I think this will be really useful once we get to the html and javascript portions of the project.  I think we'll probably split those up and each work on our own sections then combine them, hopefully in person.

It might not help at all.  Who knows.
